ANTI-TRUST LAW
That Supreme Court
Weakened Operation
e Sherman Law.
Washi bgton. D. C, Dec 5. In strik
ing cont -ast to the practice of his pred
ecessor, president Taft today sent to
congress an "annual message" which
required I only 38 minutes te read, in
stead ofthe five to six hour encyclo
pedias traversing every topic of hu-
man interest from obll weevils to ba
bies and krom Mooselookmaguntic lake
to Mars, which president Roosevelt
used to slhip down to the capitol on
such occasions.
President Taft confines his "arnaal
message" y to one topic only the anti
trust law fend proposed modifications in
direction ef more effectual federal con.
mtr9!-i . I
ie- aenves mat tne recent supreme i
court dectc'ons in ar-y way weaken or I
restrict tne operation of the law; on
the contrary, he says they only state an
old and well established rule in a new
way. He .describes the enforced disso
lution of the tobacco trust and volunta
ry dissolution of other trusts. Mere
size, he says, is no objection, but' the
only ru,e 'that shuuld be applied is un
lawful monopoly and restraint of trade
by means prohibited- in law.
For new legislation, the president
suggests a law defining definitely the
wrong methods prohibited; provision
for federal Incorporation; and a federal
corporation" commission with large
powers, similar in scope to those of the
controler of the currency or of the
interstate commerce commission. The
message follows: ;
First of a Series.
To the Senate and House of Represen
tatives: This message is the first of several
which I shall send to congress during
the interval between the opening of its
regular session anJ its adjournment for
the Christmas holidays. The amount
of information to be communicated as
to the operations of the government,
the number of important subjects call
ing for comment by the executive, and
the transmission to congress of ex
haustive reports of special commissions,
make it impossible to include in one
message of a reasonable length a dis
cussion of the topics that ought to be
brohght to the attention of the national
legislature at its first regular session.
The Anti Trust Law.
I- May last the supreme court handed
down decisions in the sulfa in equity
brought by the United States to en
join the further maintenance of the
Standard Oil trust and of the Ameri
can Tobacco trust, and to secure their
dissolution. The decisions are epoch
making and serve to advise the business
world authoritatively of the scope' of
operation of the anti trust act of 1890.
Xo Sen Precedent.
The decisions do not depart in any
substantial way from the previous de
cisions of the court is construing and
applying this important statute, but
they clarify those decisions by further
defining the already admitted excep
tions to the literal construction of the
act. By the decrees, they furnish a
useful precedent as to the proper meth
od of dealing with the capital and prop
erty of illegal trusts.
These decisions suggest the need and
wisdom of additional or supplemental
legislation to make it easier for the en
tire business community to square with I
tne rule or action and legality thus
finally established and to preserve
the benefit, freedom and spur of rea
sonable competition without loss of real
efficiency or progress.
Net a Xew Rale.
The statute in its first section de
clares to be illegal "every contract,
combination in the form of trust or
otherwise, or conspiracy. In restraint of
trade or commerce among the several
states or with foreign nations," and
in the second, declares guilty of a mis
demeanor "tevery person who shall mon
opolise or attempt to monopolize or
combine or conspire with any other
person to monopolize any part 'of the
trade or commerce of the several states
or with foreign nations."
Is two early cases, where the statute
was invoked to enjoin a transportation
rate agreement between interstate rail
road companies, ft was held that It was
no defence to show that the agreement

PRESIDENT FOWLER
. DELIVERS ADDRESS
Chicago, HI, Dec. . Experts in ir
rigation from many of the -western
states and from a dogen foreign conn
tries, including Mexico, Canada and
Central and South America, and gov
ernment officiate interested in the re
clamation of arid and swamp lands, at
tended the opening today of the 19th
annual meeting of thp National Irri
gation congress.
Taft Sends Greetings.
Dr. F. H. Newell, director of the
United States reclamation service; R.
P. Teele. in charge of irrigation sta
tistics of the bureau of censue. and
senator William E. Borah, of Idaho,
were the chief speakers for the after
noon session. An encouraging mes
sage from president Taft was re
ceived. President Fowler's Address.
President Benjamin A. Fowler, speak
at the opening of the irrigation con
gress, advocated amendments to the
national Irrigation act and urged thevl
reclamation oi swamp lands as two of'
the most important matters for discus
sion by the congress.
"More than nine years have passed
since the national irrigation act became
a law ana the reclamation service was
organized," said president Fowler in
taking up the subject of the proposed
amendments. "As anticipated by its
friends, the act has In practice -demonstrated
some, weaknesses, which could
not he foreseen, but ought now to be
corrected.
"I. The time limit of 10 years in
which to return to the government in J
equal annual payments the cost of) con
struction of a project fs now recog
nized as too short, and the necessity of
an extension. 4s admitted.
"1. Theoretically, irrigated lands
under any government project ought
to furnish the best of security for con
servative mortgage loans at low inter
est. But outside capital hesitates to of
fer itself for such loans because in
case of foreclosure, the act operates
against the mortgagee and prevents
him as a nonresident from securing
title. Tills ought to be remedied In
the Interest of both sides.
"3. Experience has shown that when
any project is more than half complet
ed, acreage property has so appreciated
in value that the opportunity for the
speculator as such or the large capi
talist -has gone forever, and the time has
come when the owner should no longer
be required to live on these lands."
Regarding the reclamation of swamp
lands. President Fowler said in part:
'lln addition to the land area avail
able -. for reclamation through irriga
tion, there are about 80,000,000 acres of
swamp and overflow lands not now in
habitable but susceptible to drainage.
"Though these wet lands are mostly
along the gulf and Atlantic slopes, with
considerable areas in tbe Pacific states.
they are distributed throughout e- ry
state. Generally of great fertility ney
would, if reclaimed, sustain a popula
tion of 90,000,000 of people. While not
yet settled or cultivated, except in a
small way. most of the wet lands have
been ceded to states and have passed
into private ownership. . By far the
greater portion of the area (for exam
ple, in the lower Mississippi region),
is so located that drainage projects
would necessarily affect several states,
so that the drainage problem is essen
tially interstate, involving federal ac
tion with that of the states."

CONGRESS READY
TO PROBE MATTER
Mexico City, Mexico. Dec 5. Revolu
tions in Yucatan, Tamaulipas asd Sen
Luis Potosi are disturbing the Mex
ican government. Vice sresldent Pino
Suarez, a citizen of Yucatan, declares
the insurrection in that state is due to
Delio Moreno Canton, defeated candi
date for governor., Canton Is la New
in .niHtllaa Hut rebela-re led by
Emiliano-xfooita, who recently escaped
after being arrested In Veraerux. The
San Luis Potosi band apparently has
no leader. At the department of the
Interior it is admitted that the Yuca
tan revolt is Reyista lit character; the
known leader of the TamauHpas in
surrection is a Reyista,, while the pil
lagers In San Luis Potosi are sacking
haciendas to the cry of "viva Reyes."
The rebellion in Yucatan is almost
statewide, according to advices reoflwed
yesterday by tbe government. So seri
ous is the situation regarded that a
gunboat has been ordered to proceed
from Veracruz to Progresso with a de
tachment of troops and a full supply
of ammuriition.
A dispatch from Merida, tne capital
of Yucatan, says the communication
with the interior is hampered, the
wires having been cut, but reports
brought to the capital by couriers in
dicate that the rising is of little im
portance. Shooting of Prisoners.
The ministers of war, justice and
gobernacion have been summoned to
appear before the chamber of deputies
and explain the alleged shooting of
prisoners taken during the recent up
risings and the mistreatment of news
paper men by the authorities.
The summons Dresented to the vari
ous ministers states that the press has
published stories of the summary exe
cution of prisoners in various parts of
the country, that Pedro, L. Ulloa, aj
newspaper man. was arrested in Her
mosillo without due process of law,
and that Brigido Caro and Roberto Ber
nal were obliged to pee to the United
States for certain articles they had
written and that they were threatened
with death if they returned to Mexico.
At the war department it was denied
that any men had been shot, except
during combats, and that all prison
ers were turned over to the author
ities. The minister of gobernacion
aid that he had heard of no execu
tions or mistreatment of cltlneus by
the authorities. There had been fight
ing in Durango. Coahulla, Teplc and
other parts of the country, but the
men who had hist their lives had been
killed while fighting against their
f-ountry. He would request the judges
to make an investigation, but he be
lieved that it was all untrue.
Compulsory Service Distasteful.
The Democratic Anti-reelectionlst
party has issued a call to all the inde
pendent parties of the city to meet With
t at 7 oclock this evening in the New
York salon to discuss the attitude of
resident Madero In respect to recruit
ing soldiers for the army.
The invitation states that as the
party feels it to be Its duty to guard
the principles of the platform sworn
to by president Madero and seeing that
the decree of the president in regard to
obligatory military service violates the
principles of the platform, the party
calls Sipon all the parties which took
part in the convention of last August
and September to take action against
the "wrong committed against the
platform by the triumphant candidate
of the parties."
To 'Increase Army.
If Madero's plans are carried out the
Mexican army will have 15,000 new sol
diers on February 1 next year. The de
cree of December 17. 1910, regarding

Shanghai. China. Dec 6. Eeach day
brings, keener apprehension that China
Is drifting into a political chaos.
The revolutionary juntas here are
now marking time, awaiting the arrival
of Dr. Sun Yat Sen. It is hoped that he
may prove to be the leader whom every
one is seeking. If he can line up the
various revolutionary chiefs and unlfy
the movement, a solution of China's
troubles may be ho?ed for. There are
dissensions everywhere .among the reb
els, especially at the Wu Chang and
Nanking headquarters.
The lall of Han Tang last week
proves to have been due entirely to
wholesale desertions of rebel troops
enroled in Hunan province.
Huang Sing In Shanghai.
The rebel eeenraL Huansr Sing, -who
was at Wu Chang as second in com-1
mand to Uen. Li Yuen Heng. left Han
Yang a short time before the im
perialists regained that city. He ar
rived in Shanghai this week and imme
diately proclaimed himself generalis
simo of the revolutionary forces as
signed to Li, a subsidiary place. Huang
asserts that he has been given the right
to name a., temporary premier or edu
cator act pending ihe election of a
president. He is now making plans, he
says, for an overland advance on Pekin
through Shan Tung province.
Cost Is Enormous.
The cost of the struggle thus far has
been far greater than is easily realized.
Apart from the losses of campaign and
battle fields, it has plunged a majority
of the provinces into poverty and
famine, it has stopped all commerce
and trade, crippled agriculture and In
dustry, and diverted practically every
penny of tax revenue from the purpose
of peace.
Brigandage Is General.
Brigandlng is almost the only prof
itable profession left to a people hith
erto peaceable and orderly. Millions
are starving within a radius of a few
hundred miles of Shanghai. In in
creasing numbers there are brought
to this city accounts of robberies and
violence and even the killing of Euro
peans has ceased to be exceptional In
the absence of law and order. Close
observers are more and more uneasy
regarding the prospects for foreigners
in the immediate future.
Both sides are financially close to
