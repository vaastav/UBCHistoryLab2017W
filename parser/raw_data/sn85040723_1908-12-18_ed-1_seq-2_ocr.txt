WORK OF^CONGRESS.
Senate.
The Senate held a short session on the
10th, during which an agreement was
reached for taking up the omnibus claims
bill Monday with the understanding that it
(shall not Interfere with the consideration
Of the postal savings hill or any other
measure in which senators are especially in
terested. Senator Lodge gave notice that he
Would on Wednesday speak on the Browns
ville affair. After a short executive session
the Senate at 1:08 o’clock adjourned until
llonday in respect to the memory of the
late Representative Charles T. Dunwell of
New York.
The Senate was not in session on the 11th.
The Heart.** was not In session on the 12th.
The Brownsville affair consumed nearly
the entire session. Senator Foraker ob
tained the floor early and read letters from
a former soldier of the Twenty-fifth regi
ment telling of the procedure of govern
ment detectives In attempts to get a con
fession from him. Mr. Foraker introduced
an amendment to his original bill for the
re-enlistment of these soldiers providing
that a commission of three retired army
officers be created to determine whether
discharged soldiers are Innocent of com
plicity in the shooting up of Brownsville as
a prerequisite fur their re-enlistment In
stead of leaving that duty with the Presi
dent, as provided by the Warner bill. The
President's message giving the results of
the war department’s Investigation of the
Brownsville affair was read and Mr. For
aker again took the floor to comment upon
the message. Senator Carter announced
that on the 15th he would speak upon the
postal savings bank bill and would ask that
It be made the unfinished business of the
Benate.
The President’s Panama canal message
was read on the 15th and Its reading was
received with loud laughter by some of the
senators. Senator Foraker endeavored to
have adopted a resolution calling on the sec
retary of war for detailed Information con
cerning the men employed. Instructions giv
en and expenses incurred in the investiga
tion by detectives Into the Brownsville af
fair, referred to by the President in his mes
fiage of the 14th. Senator Warren objected
to Immediate consideration. The postal sav
ings bank bill was the subject of speeches
by Senators Carter and Depew, both of
whom advocated the measure. The bill was
made the unfinished bnslnesec, displacing
the Joint resolution for the repeal of the
commodity clause of the interstate com
merce law. On motion of Senator Fulton
the omnibus claims bill will bo taken up on
January •>. Brief memorial services were
held for flic late Representative George W.
Smith of Illinois, and at 3:30 the Senate ad
journed.
Considerable time was devoted on the
Kith to a discussion of the President’s
course In placing strictures on Congress in
the matter of the secret service, and a
searching resolution, proposed by Mr. Aid
rich ami amended upon the suggestion of
Mr. Culberson, providing for a thorough
investigation by the committee on appro
priations of the President’s charges, both in
respect to the acts and the course that,
should be taken by Congress to resent the
Imputations believed to have been east upon
that body, was adopted. Mr. Aldrich, in In
troducing his resolution, made no comment
upon it, but Senators Bailey, Bacon, Till
man. Culberson and others declared that the
President’s words should be resented by the
Senate as highly insulting. Senator For
aker’e resolution calling on the secretary of
war for informal in concerning the work of
defectives in the Brownsville affair also was
adopted. Senator Lodge spoke In support of
the Warner hill permitting the President
to re-enllst the discharged soldiers of the
Twenty-fifth regiment at his discretion.
The Senate at 3:30 adjourned.
House.
At no time was there a quorum in the
House. The legislative appropriation bill
was presented and several hills passed,
among them being one authorizing the re
moval of the imposition of loss of citizen
ship upon deserters in the military and
naval services. The rest of the day was
taken up iu discussing the bill to provide
for the arbitrary Investigation of difficulties
between employers and employes. Its con
sideration had not been concluded when the
House at 4:59 p. in. adjourned until Friday.
The legislative, executive and judicial ap
propriation bill, which usually excites con
siderable discussion. lasting' for several
days, was passed with little debate and
practically in the shape in which it came
from committee. An unusual feature was
that no member asked for time to indulge in
general talk. The bill carries an appropria
tion of $31,6(15,320. The House, immediately
after convening, unanimously and without
debate adopted a resolution providing for
the appointment of a committee of five to
consider the reference to the secret service
In the President’s message and to suggest,
what action, if any. should lie taken in the
matter. At 5:11 p. m. the House adjourned.
No particular programme had been mapped
out for the 12th, hut under a call of com
mittees several measures in which the
members were especially interested were
considered. With few exceptions they eu
gendred the- liveliest sort of debate. " Par
liamentary tactics were freely resorted to,
with the result that five times the roll was
called. The first wrangle occurred on a
resolution fixing the boundary line between
the states of Colorado. Oklahoma and New
Mexico, which was adopted by a good ma
jority. but not without two roil calls. The
House then by a decisive vote refused
further to consider the bill providing for
arbitrary settlement of disputes between
employers and employes. Next the bill pro
viding for the protection of aliens in the
United States was thrashed out at length.
The measure had rough sailing, and it was
passed by a slim majority after the roll had
been called twice. At 5:27 p. m. the House
adjourned.
While considering bills dealing with af
fairs in the District of Columbia the House
on the 14th passed a measure for 85-ceut
gas In Washington. The hill now goes to
the Senate, as well as another bill abolish
ing "bucket shops” in the district. A hill
providing for free lectures in the public
schools was voted down. An attempt by
Representative Henry of Texas to obtain
a change lu the reference of a bill pro
hibiting the making of future contracts on
agricultural products brought forth the
promise from Chairman Scott of the agri
cultural committee that his committee
would soon grant hearings to farmers’
unions and others on this subject. The
House voted to adjourn Saturday, Decem
ber 19, to Monday. January 4, and ad
journed for the day at 5 p. in.
The hopes of the so-called insurgents for
a revision of the rules of that body were
dissipated, for the time being at least, when
Mr. Gardner of Massachusetts failed to ob
tain the adoption of an amended resolution
calling for the appointment of a committee
of eight members to consider the subject
and report the changes deemed necessary.
By a substantial majority the House voted
to take away from the committee on for
eign affairs consideration of the resolution,
■which In Its original form, simply called
for information from the secretary of state
regarding what the British House of Com
mons had done in that regard. A ruling by
the speaker that the amendment of Mr.
Gardner changed the character of the reso
lution iu such a way as to make it not pri
vileged was sustained and the resolution
then was laid on the table. After passing
some bills relating to the District of Co
lumbia the remainder of the day was taken
up with the bill to revise the peua! laws of
the United States. At 5:30 p. m. the House
adjourned.
Except for n few moments speht in the
transaction of routine business and the
passage of two bridge bills, the House on
the 16th devoted its entire time to the
further consideration of the bill to revise
the penal laws of the United States. The
Oarrett amendment, which came over from
last night and which prohibited the sending:
through the mails of information bearing on
transactions in futures, was defeated by a
decided vote. \Vlthout opposition an amend
ment by Mr. Houston (Tennessee) was
adopted making It an offense to deposit in
or ship through the mails intoxicating
liquors. There was sti',l pending when th >
Mil was laid aside an amendment by Mr.
Humphreys of Mississippi providing for the
Identification of Intoxicating liquors trans
ported by interstate carriers. This propo
sition evolved extended debate. At 4;57 p.
m. the House adjourned.

BONIRENOUNCES
PLEA FOR MONEY;
■WANTS CHILDREN
:OUNT FEELS INDIGNANT AT PRIN
CESS DE SAGAN FOR SAYING
HE NEEDS CASH.
HIS FEELINGS ARE OUTRAGED.
Declares George Gould Believes His
Golden Authority Can Guild Sis
ter’s Marriage to Prince.
HOLD WILL NOT COVER BASENESS.
PARIS, Dec. 16.—The hearing of the
suit brov.ght by Count Boni de Castel
lane against the Princess de Sagan, in
which he petitions that the custody of
his three children be given to his moth
er, the Marquise de Castellaae, was con
tinued in this city today.
M. Bonnet was heard iu rejoinder for
the count. He read a letter from the
count renouncing the petition for $60,-
000 annually for the maintenance of the
children, but insisting more emphatically
thau ever that the children be confided
to the care of his mother. The relin
quishment of the financial demand came
as a surprise in spite of the fact that
such a course was indicated at the close
of the first hearing of the case.
“Indignant at Lies.”
The letter of the count was addressed
to M. Bonnet and it is couched in an
eloquent phraseology of outraged man
hood. It begins: “indignant at the per
fidious and lying insinuations of the
princess and her family representing that
my only desire is to obtain a big allow
ance, 1 now ask for myself and my moth
er only the custody of the children; I
renounce with pleasure the request for
an allowance.”
Continuing, the count calls M. Bonnet
to witness with what outraged feelings
he rejected the pecuniary offers of the
Prince and Princess de Sagan and
George Gould, the princess’ brother.
“The new and unexpected attitude of
George Gould,” de Castellaue writes,
“who regards this suit simply as a vulgar
affair of money and who believes that
his golden authority can gild the mar
riage of his sister with a tarnished man
compels me more strongly than ever to
i..sist on the withdrawal of the children
from the house of which the prince is
the ornament and from surroundings
where they will learn only one thing—
that honor is nothing and money ev
erything, that money covers ev< ry base
ness and that it will buy every con
science.
Disagrees with Goulds.
“The decision 1 have taken wdll show
the court the sole purpose which inspires
me, my parents and my relatives. We
are without fortunes and upon the ques
tion of money we do not hold the same
theories as do the Goulds. Concerning
the education of French youths, we have
oilier ideas thau those of the De Sagans.
My parents will aid me to bring up
these three innocent victims.”
Hints at Divorce.
After asking the court to take notice
of the modification of the petition of his
client, M. Bonnet launched into a vigor
ous denunciation of his adversaries. He
charged that on many points the defend
ants did not dare to meet the allega
tions of the count, citing particularly the
allegation that the Princess de Sagan
was ready to leave her present husband.
“They did not dare challenge this state
ment.” the lawyer said, “because they
know that the proposed separation has
been formally communicated to De Cas
tellane’s attorneys.”
Continuing. M. Bonnet said that all of
the offers of settlement made by the
Princess de Sagan were conditioned
upon the count’s renunciation of his
children, hut the count refused to sell
either himself or his children.
The princess had told Judge Ditte
that if the children were taken from her
sla* would disinherit them, thus proving
that in her eyes everything was a ques
tion of money.
Calls Princess Extravagant.
Referring to the charges that De Cas
tellane had dissipated his wife’s fortune,
M. Bonnet insisted that the countess was
just as much responsible as her husband
for the “royal extravagances” such as
the Malukoff palace, the Chateau Ma
rais, and the Charity bazar, which alone
cost $300,000. The lawyer particularly
resented George Gould's share in the de
fense, saying that now the question of
money had been eliminated, Mr. Gould
was playing the mysterious role of Craw
ford in the Humbert affair. Asa matter
of fact, Mr. Gould alway-s had opposed
the marriage of his sister to the Prince
de Sagan, and he only finally consented
on condition that there should be a sep
aration of property.
“Does Mr. Gould fear that his sister
will get another divorce and made a
more unfortunate third marriage?” asked
M. Bonnet. “No, I can reassure him;
the princess can find nobody worse than
De Sagan.”
The lawyer then asked the court to or
der the taking of testimony on certain
points which the defense had declined to
meet. In conclusion, he appealed to the
court to withdraw the three children
from the custody of their mother, who
had married a man renounced by one
of the greatest families of France, and
“who has spent a month in prison,” and
place them in the care of the mother
of the count, whose only purpose was to
direct her grandchildren in the right
path.
At the conclusion of M. Bonnet’s re
marks. M. Clemenceau replied for the
princess. The case was then adjourned
for a week, when the public prosecutor
will present his conclusions. A decision
is expected in a fortnight, unless the
court decides to hear testimony.
As at previous sessions of the court
when this case was hoard, the courtroom
was crowded with Parisians anxious to
hear this famous scandal bared. In the
the suit for the custody of the chidren,
tire doors are thrown open to the public,
but were closed when Princess de Sagan
secured her divorce from Count Boni.

PULITZER REPLIES
TO THE PRESIDENT
EDITOR OF NEW YORK WORLD DE
CLARES HIS PAPER WILL NOT
BE MUZZLED.
CALLS MESSAGE LESE MAJESTE
Bulldozing of Judges and Slander of Pri
vate Citizens Is Another Declara
tion in Editorial.
IS NOT AFRAID TO GO TO JAIL.
NEW YORK, Dec. IG. Under the
caption "Lese Majeste” The World
prints the following editorial on Presi
dent Roosevelt's Panama message;
Mr. Roosevelt is mistaken. He cannot
muzzle the World. While no amount ol
billingsgate on his part can alter our de
termination to treat him with judicial im
partiality and scrupulous fairness, we re
peat what we have already said—that the
Congress of tnc United States should make
a thorough investigation of the whole Pa
nama tnusictiou that the full truth may be
known to the American people.
It is a must extraordinary circumstance
that Mr. Roosevelt himself did not demand
such an inquiry. All his protestations ol
outrag' and virtue, ail his torrents of impre
cation and denunciation, end with the
amazing assertion that "there is nothing
whatever in which this government Is inter
ested to investigate about this transaction.”
World Returns Thanks.
The World fi liy appreciates the compli
ment paid to it by Mr. Roosevelt iu mak
ing it the subject of a special message tc
the Congress of the. United States, lu the
whole history of American government no
other President has ever paid such a tribute
to the power and influence of a fearless, in
dependent newspaper.
The World likewise appreciates the im
portance and significance of Mr. Roosevelt’s
statement when he declares to Congress
that the proprietor of the World "should
be prosecuted for libel by the governmental
authorities,” and that "the attorney gen
eral has under consideration the form under
which the proceedings against Mr. Pulitzer
shall be brought.”
This is the first time a President ever
asserted the doctrine of lese majesty or
proposed iu the absence of specific legisla
tion the criminal prosecution by the gov
ernment of citizens who criticised the con
duct of the government or the conduct ol
individuals who may have had business
dealings with the government. Neither the
King of Great Britain nor the German Em
peror would venture to arrogate such pow
er to himself. John Adams’ attempt to en
force the sedition law destroyed the Fed
eralist party in America. Yet Mr. Roose
velt in the absence of law officially pro
poses to use all the power of the greatest
government on earth to cripple the free
dom of the press on the pretext that the
government itself has been libeled—and he
Is the government.
Last Straw on His Back.
We are aware that for many years Mr.
Roosevelt has been savagely displeased with
the editorial conduct of the World. It Is
true that we have criticised him sharply
and frankly whenever we believed the pub
lic interest required, just as we have
heartily commended and supported him
whenever we believed the putilic interest
would thereby be advanced. Mr. Roose
velt’s attack on the World can be explained
only on the theory that he believes he can
muzzle the paper, and our recent impeach
ment of his veracity seems to have been
the last straw that broke his automatic
back.
It is true that the World printed the pub
lic reports concerning the Panama canal
affair, which resulted from William Nelson
Cromwell's appeal to the district attorney’s
office during the recent campaign to pre
vent the publication of a story which was
said to be in the hands of the Democratic
national committee. It was Mr. Cromwell's
own action which raised the issue iu the
campaign.
“If This Be Treason, Etc.”
Jt is true also that when Mr. Roosevelt
made his attack upon Delavan Smith the
World called attention to certain state
ments which Mr. Roosevelt must have
known to have been false or misleading,
and appealed to Congress to end all scan
dal by a full and impartial investigation.
If this be treason, let Mr. Roosevelt make
the most of it.
Mr. Roosevelt’s lamentable habit of in
accurate statement makes it impossible tc
accept either his judgments or his conclu
sions. In his message he does not state
correctly even so simple a matter as the
pretended causes of his grievance.
Ho says, for example, that the World
asserted that there was “corruption by oi
on tiehulf of the government of the United
States.” No such charge was made by this
newspaper.
He says it was asserted that there were
“improper dealings of some kind between
agents of the government and outside per
sons.” No such charge was made.
Denies Taft Charge.
lie says.that “among those persons who,
it was alleged, made 'huge prollts’ were
Charles P. Taft, a brother of William 11.
Taft, then candidate for the presidency,
and Douglas Robinson, my brother-in-law.
No such charge was made.
The World has never said that Charles
I’. Taft or Douglas Robinson made any
profits whatever. Mr. Taft denied that he
was concerned in the transaction in any
way, which denial the World published and
accepted. It would have been equally glad
to print Mr. Robinson’s denial could it
have succeeded in obtaining one from him,
as it frequently attempted. The World has
no evidence that he was associated with
Mr. Cromwell and would accept his word tc
that effect, for Mr. Robinson is an estim
able gentleman of high character whose
reputation for veracity is infinitely- better
than that of his distinguished brother-iu
law.
“Not to Be Intimidated.”
If the World has libeled anybody- we hope
it will be punished, but we do not intend
to be intimidated by Mr. Roosevelt’s threats
or by Mr. Roosevelt’s denunciation, or by
Mr. Roosevelt's power.
Mr. Roosevelt’s seething indignation
about the World’s “libel upon the United
States government” Is an exquisite indict
ment, indeed, coming as it does from a
President who, less than a week ago of
ficially insinuated in his message that the
Congress of the United States was com
posed of scoundrels who amended an ap
propriation bill because “congressmen did
not themselves wish to be investigated by
secret service men.”
No living man ever so grossly lilteled toe
United States as does this President who
besmirches Congress, bulldozes judges, as
sails the integrity of courts, slanders pri
vate citizens and who has shown himsell
the most reckless, unscrupulous demagogue
whom the American people ever trusted
with great power and authority.
We say this not in auger, but iu sincere
sorrow. The World has Immeasurably moit
respect for the office of President of the
United States than Theodore Roosevelt hue
ever shown during the years iu which he
has maintained a reign of terror and villi
tied the honor and honesty of both public
officials and private citizens who opposed
his policies or thwarted him iu his pur
poses.
So far as the World is concerned, Its pro
prietor may go to jail If Mr. Roosevelt sue
ceeds. as he threatens; but even in jail the
World will not cease to he a fearless cham
pion of free speech, a free press and a free
people.
It cannot be muzzled.

SITS AT TABLE WITH SPOONER
NEW YORK, Dec. 17. —Bringing his
stay in New York to a close last night,
President-elect William 11. Taft was the
guest of honor at one of the most notable
banquet ever held in this city. It was

the 100 tables placed in the grand ball
room in Astor gallery of the Waldorf-
Astoria borel were men gathered from

ers in many walks of life.
Mr. Taft took advantage of the occa
sion, in a speech iilled with more ear
nestness, perhaps, than any he has de
livered since his election, to pledge his
administration and his party, so far as
he can control it, to a loyal adherence
to the Chicago platform, lie dwelt al
most wholly upon the revision of the
tariff, which he singled out as the most
important declaration made at the last
annual convention, and, after having
previously referred to the veto power of
the chief executive, said, with all the
emphasis of which he was capable:
"Better no revision at all, better that
the new bill should fail, unless we have
an honest and thorough revision on the
basis laid down and the principle out
lined in the party platform.”
Approves Sherman Law.
Mr. Taft also referred again to the
Sherman anti-trust law and declared for
its enforcement as one of the Roosevelt
policies that the party had pledged itself
to carry forward.
Seated at the "President’s table,” with
Mr. Taft, were the vice president-elect,
Mr. Sherman: Gov. Hughes of New
York, who paid a glowing tribute to Mr.
Taft during the course of the evening;
Henry W. Taft, president of the society
and toastmaster; Charles P. Taft of Cin
cinnati. Horace D. Taft of Watertown,
Conn.; Dr. Arthur T. Hadley, president
of Yale university, former Senator John
C. Spooner, who responded to the toasts;
J. Pierpont Morgan, Paul Morton, Gov.

tary Straus. Frank 11. Hitchcock, Bish
op Leonard of Ohio, Gen. H. C. Cor
bin, Admiral Casper Goodrich and oth
ers.
Four Rockefelle-rs There.
At another table and rivaling the at
tention of the diners the “four Tafts'*
at the President’s table, were four
Rockefellers John I)., John D., Jr.,
William Rockefeller and P. A. Rocke
feller. With them sat John D. Arch
bold, the active head of the Standard
Oil company, and John G. Milburn, the
special counsel of the company.
Frank B. Kellogg, who has been pros
ecuting the Standard Oil company, and
W illiam Nelson Cromwell, so prominent
ly brought to the front in the recent
Panama canal discussion, were near
neighbors to the Rockefellers.
_ After a stay of four days in this city
President-elect Taft left at 7:55 a. m.
today for Washington and Augusta.
Ga.. where he will have his last period
of rest and recreation before assuming
the duties of the chief executive. His
sons, Robert A. Taft and Charles P.
Taft, and Mr. Taft’s assistant secre
tary, Wendell Mischler, were left to

Wireless Investigators’ Warfare in Frisco

SAN FRANCISCO. Cal., Dec. 17.
Because government wireless messages
have been interfered with near here, two
rival associations of youthful investi

curtailed. The wireless warfare between
the two organizations has seriously in
terfered with the dispatch of government
messages aud as the result a federal in

societies have members in all of the
cities about the bay aud the fictitious
messages which they send to each other
every night greatly annoy the regular

LINCOLN, Neb., Dec. 17.—William J.
Bryan takes radical issv.es with Presi
dent Roosevelt in the latter's declaration
that it is the duty of the government
to prosecute an individual or newspaper
which attacks the government or govern
ment officials. In an editorial which will
appear in next week's issue of his Com
moner. Mr. Bryan attacks the Presi
dent’s message and comes to the rescue
of the press. He says:
President Roosevelt has sent to Congress
a message which announces anew and dan
gerous doctrine. It is the duty of every
publisher and every believer in free speech
and press to resent the President’s attempi
to use the government to terrorize those
who would criticise the action of public of
ficials. No official can claim exemption
from criticism merely because ho Is an of
ficial, and no act of the government is so
sacred that the humblest citizen may not
express an adverse opinion upon it.
It is a matter of little consequence wheth
er the charges made by the World are true
or false—that can he determined by suit at
law in the ordinary way—but it is a matter
of great importance that every editor and
every other individual shall lie free to ex
press his opinion on any subject connected
with public affairs. The World demands an
investigation of the Panama purchase, and
It is for Congress to determine whether the
Investigation shall lie made. The fact that
the President thinks no investigation is
necessary Is immaterial.
Bryan Scores President.
An investigation is the best method of
bringing out the facts, and if there has
been misrepresentation the President ought
to urge investigation rather than to oppose
it.
But this proposition that the government
ran Institute libel proceedings against an
individual or a paper for criticism of the
government's action is not only anew doc
trine, but an extremely objectionable one.
if any individual has been libeled he has
his action at law. If the individual con
cerned does not see fit to prosecute his
remedy the government cannot become bis
champion.
The President says that the execution of
the purchase act was in the hands of Attor
ney General Knox and that he, the Presi
dent. approved of everything that Mr.
Knox did. If either the President or Mr.
Knox is charged with ’’mproper conduct,
the courts nre open to them, but the Presi
dent cannot use the attorney general to
punish those who criticise him. Senator
Knox, or any other official. Whatever of
fense the World has committed —if It has
committed an offense—is not against the
government but against Individuals who
are accused of bringing improper influence
to bear upon officials.
Pulitzer on Solid Ground.
Mr. Pulitzer is on solid ground when he
resists the. President's attempt to convert
newspaper 'criticism of officials into a criti
cism against the government itself. The
President’s message is indefensible in so far
as it asserts the right of the government to
prosecute the World, or Mr. Pulitzer, and
he will find that he lias overstepped the
limits of his authority if he attempts to use
the attorney general’s office in the way
that he has proposed. The President is
not the government: a criticism of him is
not a criticism of the government.

FINDS NO EVIDENCE.
Missouri Attorney Says State Is Up
Against It for “Specialists” to
Study Races.
KANSAS CITY, Mo., Dec. 17.—C.
F. McPherson, assistant general man
iger of the Missouri Pacific road, re
.umeil testimony today in the Missouri
ate case hearing. It is understood that
•nly three more witnesses will testify.
Until Mr. McPherson took the stand,
ill of the witnesses had testified in the
■ase of the St. Louis-San Francisco
oad, but as much of their testimony
vas of an expert nature it will not be
lecessary to repeat it in the case of the
•ther seventeen roads involved.
Mr. McPherson’s statements were on
he same order as those of the preceding
vitnesses —that it was impossible for the
•aihoads to operate under the 2-cent
lasseuger rate except at a loss, and that
lie greater cost of handling state freight
•ver interstate freight m..kes the inaxi
uum freight rate a hardship.
Mr. McPherson was cross-examined
oday at length by P. W. Lehmann, one
>f the attorneys for the state. But few
'acts desired by the state were secured,
lowever, according to the view of Sau
'ord B. Ladd, another lawyer represeut
ng the prosecution, and he was moved
:o say;
“The state is up against it. We have
10 specialists and even with the freest
iccess to the railroad records, we cau
lot develop evidence to the same extent
is the railroad specialists.”
Mr. McPherson had said that the Mis
souri Pacific had reduced its working
ioree one-half between November, 1907,
md April, 1908, and that the August
•eport for 1908 had shown that the force
lad increased.
“Y’ou had failed in jour fat years
hen. to make provision for the lean
rears?” Mr. Lehmann asked.
“That is a feature of the policy j’ou
will have to inquire about of someone
?lse,” replied Mr. McPherson.
