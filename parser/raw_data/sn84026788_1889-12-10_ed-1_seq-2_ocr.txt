wine, needs no praise. To know it
is to admire it. It grows better every
year, and is constantly strengthening
its hold on popular respect. While
no pent-up Utica confines its enter

terests or needs of the State in which
it is published, and makes the wel
fare of Maryland its especial concern.

SKETCH OP MB. DAVIS' LIFE.
Jefferson Davis was born in what
is now Todd county, Kentucky, June
3, 1808. While he was still an infant
his family moved to Mississipi. He
entered Transylvania college, but left
when "appointed to West Point by
President Monroe. He was assigned
to the first infantry and took an ac
tive part in the Black Hawk war, of
1831-2. He resigned from the army
in 1835 after his romantic elopement
with the daughter of Xachary Taylor
and became a cotton planter near
Vicksburg. He was elccted a Rep
resentative to Congress in 1845 and
took his seat in December of that
year, but the following year resigned
to become Colonel of the first Missis
sippi volunteer rifles. He served
throngh the Mexican war with great
Credit, being highly complimented
for his bravery and coolness in the
battle of Ruena Vista, where he was
severely wounded. In 1847 he was
appointed ?o fill a vacancy in the
United States Senate and in the fol
lowing year was elected Senator by a
unanimous vote of the legislature.?
In 18o0he was elected for a full term.
In 18J1 he resigned his" seat to take
part in the State canfrass and rah for
governor on the State rights ticket.
He Was defeated, alShotrglr by his
popularly he redl-.ced the union ma
jority from 7,500 to 999. After the
election of Franklin Pierce to the
presidency Mr. Davis; who had been
one of lus ardent supporters, was ap
pointed Secretary of War. At the
close of his term of office he again en
tered the Senate. In lflflo he made
a speech in which he said he would
be willing to make any sacrifice in
ia order to avert the impending strug
gle. In 1861 Mr. Davis made another
speech on the State of the country,
in which he claimed tile right 'of
States to secede and denied the right
of coercion. When Mississippi se
ceded he started for home, but be
fore he reached there he was appointed
commander in chief of the army of
Mississippi. On February 18, 1861,
he exchanged this olflce for that of
president of the confederacy. He ?
took up his official residence at Rich
mond, where soon after his arrival the
handsome estate of Mr. James A.
Seddon was bought and presented to ,
him by admiring citizens. Immedi
ately after the assassination of Pres
ident Lincoln, Mr. Davis and his par
ty were captured while encamped at
Irwmsville, Ga., by a force of cav
alry under command of Lieut. Col.
Pritchard. He was indicted for tre
son, but on May 13, 1867, he was re
leased on ?100,000 bail, the first name
on his bail bond being that of Horace
Greeley. He was never brought to
trial, a nolle prosequi being entered
by the government in the case.
He was also included in the general
amnesty of December, 1868. In 1879
Mrs. Dorsey, of Beauvoir, Miss., be
queathed bfm her handsome estate,
and he has since lived there in com
parative retirement, devoting much
of his time to literary pursuits. Mr
Davis has one child, Miss Winnie
Davis, who has been called the "Child
of the Confederacy." She was borrt
in Richmond during the war and is a
remarkabfy handsome woman. Miss
Davfs is now traveling in Europe with
Mrs. Joseph Pulitzer.

pect of even larger figures. This actual and
prospective excess of receipts requires, says
the President, "the attention pf Congress,
with a view to reducing tte Y'ecclptt of the
triastify To the needs of the government. ?
A. reduction of taxation is not urged, as it Is
practicable to "reduce receipts" by increas
ing tariff taxes to the point of prohibiting im
ports that compete with our favored Indus
tries. The President does not adopt Mr.
Cleveland's phrase. "Unnecessary taxation
is unjust taxation." hut puts it more mildly.?
"The collection of moneys not needed^Im
DOSCS." ho says, "an unnecessary bnrden. A
change in his opnion as to the proper nse to be
made of the money, and that a reduction of
taxation was therefore entirely unnecessary.
Mr. Cleveland's device to put the money
raised bv unnecessary taxes back into circnla
lation by loaning it to the banks in various
Mictions of the country. Mr. Harrison still
condemns, though lie does not tell how, ini de
fault of, -'anticipating onr bonds, a dearth ol

Still with the banks, after so long an interval,
will accordingly, it is announced, be gradually
withdrawn. To "reduce receipts." the Presi
Jent recommends "a revision of the tariff law.
both In iu its administrative fptjtnres and in Its
schedules." It does not a'ppcAr tbat he favors
a reduction of tariff tuxes. "The inequalities
of the law." he says, "should be adjusted, but
the protective principle should be maintained.
There should be. it seems, a leveling np rather
than a eulting down of taxes. Tin-pate,
wool and wooldb's. Tiiv cSunipln. riVescnt ine

The specific changes recommended are an ex
tension of the free list, by putting oil it clns,e8
of articles not made in this country, and the
removal of the internal tax on tobacco and on
whlskev used in the arts. With respect to sil
ver the'President Is rather non-committal. He
afflrins tliat no harm hit*comonf, the .arg|
eolna'c of silver dollars since lfcib. but thinks
"we should not tread the d ing -rous odgu of

increase of the present rate of coinage. ?
Upon the whole, liowevei1. Ije I* disposed to
think favorably of Secretary wi.-jdoni * P'*n
for the issuance id clrtineates upon the de
posit of silver bullion at its mar..i-t vaitte.
The President is evidently indisposed to

taUiii"" a decided course on a question liav
in" so equivocal a future. He is more ex
i,licit!v favorable to a large appropriation
for forts, ships end guns and for the improve

Fiooablv would be the result of the. iegislatlon
the President recommends in a truculent tone
for the supervision and control of elections in
the South. The colored population of that
section, he alles-es. is "deprived "f a,iy -*?0*]
five exercise of tlielr political rights and of
manv of their civjl rights." This is inferred.
It appears, frotn the Iket that the negro of the
South does not send Republican representa
tives to Congress to support the protective
policy. This neglect on his part the president
terms a "flagrant evil." calls a "problem' and
asks rhetorically "when is he to have those
ftlll civil rights which have so long been his in
law?" Congress is "earnest!?, luvoked to nle
s powers "ivisclv but firmly" to protm-t the
colored mar. "in all his relations to the federal
government, whether as litigant, jnror. witness,
elector,for member? of Congress or n? n tra\
e pr on oiir interstate fiUlwuvs." From the
bloody shirt question the message proceeds to
the qnestlon of subsidies, and it Is recomuiend
ed that sncli appropriations he made for ocean
mail service in American steamships between
our porta anil t hope of Central A'neriPa Sout
America, China and Japan "as will he liberal
ivrcninneralive" anil,"will encourage Ameri
can ^"p-owners. To ill? tnrther this artificial
ptimnln* to our BtcamFhipp. aP against ourpail
in" sliip? it is proposed thnt we shall also give
a subsidy to all steamers constrncteil in sucli a
manner tiiat. in case of war. tlicy can be con
verted into cruisers. Other measures "'com
mended to the favor of congress are;the Blair
education bill, the civil-service romtni-rtOn
anneal for more clerks, an appropriation to
promote the world's fair of 1SSTJ a sepnrat.nn
of the weather service from jlie \Var
mftnt and its incorporation ititli the Agrlcul
tural Department, a bill to pension every ex
soldier who is dependent oil his own exertions
for support arid Is for any reason nimble to
