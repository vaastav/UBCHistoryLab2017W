WEDNESDAY DECEMBER 8. 1S7S.
Tho President's Message.
\V7- publish this morning General Grant s
annual messactf to Congrr??. We shall no
ticc here onlv a portion of its features.
The tirst remarkable tbin^ in the message
is the statement that San Damlngo h?s ap
plied to rncle Sam to take her ur.tler hi*
protecting care. How this secret has been
so well kept we cannot imagine. AVc should
not be surprised if the Cuban troubles cause
Congress to look with more favor upon this
proposition than it would otherwise have
done. To bold San Domingo would teach
u? to expect roon to hold Cuba. If we get
hold of either, we shall not be likely ever to
lose.our hold.
The President's recommendations in re
paid to relieving the. farmers of the great
West from the present onerous charges for
transporting their grain to the markets of the
Kast do not seem to us to come up to the
requirements of the ease. To enter into co
partnership or alliance with canal companies
or States is no remedy. What the people
want is cheap transportation. They must
have it. And thev will expect Congress to
give it to them,whether the President recom
friends it or not. Of course he would not
veto a bill having this for its object, lie is
an Illinois man, and may, therefore, be ex
cused for his reference to the Tllinoi* river.
He runs off to South America unci re
commends an exploring party, and he
advises Congress to go into the business of
irrigating lands lying so far from the sea
board that they can never scud wheat away
from home, whilst ho savs not a word in
favor of tho James River canal, a work
which would do more fur the farming class
than a dozen schemes of irrigation. The
rich loam of tho Ohio and Mississippi and
Missouri valleys already produces immense
quantities of grain which caunot tir:d a
market; and yet the President would have
Congress overlook this fact, ancl undertake
t.? render productive the alkali thai the great
American Desert (as it used to be wiled) pro
duces in such abundance. We shali con
tinue to rely upon the good sense of Con
gress to do better than this.
The President's recommendations in r
g.ird to the bankrupt law wc cordially com
mend. What will the loyal bankrupt organs
t.iv of the PresiUeut for recommending ju-t
what the l>i?patch has so oKcn advised in
regard to the bankrupt law ?
Wc also approve ins recommendation in
regard to the discriminating veto, which, ns
we have bad occasion to say several limes
before, cugbt to be a part of tho constitution
cf every State ns well as of that of the United
States.
We are not sure that Congress ought to be
compelled at an extra session called by the
President to coutine its action to measures
recommended by him. Perhaps it would be
b-tier to give him the power to prorogue
Congress at all such session*, hut not at the
regular sessions?. That is, as he has to be re
sponsible for the beginning of the session,
let biUi have power to end it.
We have heretofore expressed our opin
ions in a general way ?s to the postal deposi
tories . When we *hall have steu the details
ot a bill to establish them we can speak more
intelligently. We certainly hold that there
fuoiild be devised some plan for enabling
persous to deposit their money where they
will f> cl that it ia safe, and whence it will
not be drawn whenever a Jav Cooke fails,
to the ruin of the country and the delight of
those who prolit by panitv.
The President still believes that universal
amnesty is the best policy for the Govern
ment. He has consistently held this ground.
We would fain hope that Congress has by
this time learned that he is right. It is the
Fe.leral Constitution that .still excludes a
few people from office?(not tho State Con
st.tution, as we inadvertently said yester
day;) and it is only by the action of Con
gress that these constitutional disabilities
can be removed.
The pay of Congress and the Cabinet offi
cers hus constantly been increasing from the
foundation of the Government till now, aud
the character at the iucumbents of these
places and of the services rendered by them
has just as constantly been deteriorating, lu
view of these facts tbe country will proba
bly be slow to approve the President's re
cumiuendatioii that the pay of these officials
shall be increased by giving them houses to
live in. And as to army officers, Congress
would do right if it would fix their pay at a
Certain amount aud forbid all allowances,
w nether for house-rent or any other pur
pose.
The President's financial notions seem to
be a little mixed. We approve of his recom
mendation that the banks should be pro
hibited from paying interest upou deposits.
His ideas as to lice banking seem to be
sound. But his recommendation as to the
resumption of specie payments and the re
demption of bank-notes do not strik# us as
bfiing what the country needs in this mat
ter.
Altogether, the message not a bad oue.
The President seems to be anxious to eio his
duty. His failure to refej: to Louisiana
stands iu striking contrast fo his solicitude
for tbe negroes in Cuba, who arc not more
truly deprived of their rights than are the
white people of Louisiana. Still, we repeat.!
the message might have been made more
objectionable.
Mr. Stephens on (Yua.?The Washing
ton correspondent of the Cincinnati (Com
mercial gives the most concise, pithv, ami,
wo believe, correct account of the opinions
of Mr. Stephens, of Georgia, that Ins ap
peared. From this it appears that Mr.
Stephens is very nearly 011 thesiroe line with
thf Disyatck.? Richmond Dispat'ih.
But both appear to hive been on the
wrong " line" if tlic reported settlement of
the Spanish question at Washington is cor
rectly rei>orted.?J'etcrsburg Sevcs.
By no means. It is Mr. Fish that is on
the wrong line. We stand by our
own \ ieuci. We expressed them long
b^for? the late Cuban troubles arose, and
certainly shall not abaudon them because
Mr. Fisa has not yet chosen to adopt them.
The Grand Trio.?The European politi
cal convulsions of the last tweuty-tivo years
have brought out before the world many re
maikabU; meu; but of these there were
three who stood peculiar for having been
placed by a conspiracy of circumstances as
the foremost men of their resjHjetive coun
tries without fltnes? for the responsible and
practical relation of rulers. They were Kos
bctii, LAMAnTiN?,uud Castelar. They hud
the eloquence to arouse the spirit of the na
tion und to drive it to revolution, but
were wantjoj; In tne qualities to govern
a nation wet at liberty. Kosscth was
the , greatest of the three; but Le
was a talker?the best talker who has lived
in our day. Castklak is next in order as a
j^ood talker. While Lamartin^* was the
most beautiful style, he was the least solid
orator of the three. The career of these
men has a tine moral. It shows hortr ditlcr
erent arc thc.qualitics requisite for exciting
the popular mind from tlune needed in gov
erning a people. So the agitator may lit
loose a spirit that he cannot control. lie
may. as it were, set lire to the prairie, but he
cannot extinguish the flumes; and so such
men <lo a world of evil and seldom secure to
society nn amount of good that at all com
pensates for the evils they bring upon it.
CaStelar's part is not yet played out.
The Richmond Dispatch regards the
Hit aid's news as tensational, and stems to
think an amicable .settlement may still be
brought about.? Wytheville Enterprise.

The present is an improvement upon the

The world knows Robert Dale Owen.
He is a man of tine attainments and a man of

ho is all wrong according to the orthodox
filth in the Christian world. lie is quite an
eulhusiast in bis sociological as well as in his
theological views, and has failed signally in
bis attempt at a domestic Utopia. His books
are writteu in an easy, classical style, and his
views arc presented iu a very fascinating
manner. Some of them have the charm of
the novel. 31 r. Owen is a learned man, whose
teachings tend to no good. They unsettle
the mind, and give no recompense lor the
peace they may take from the breast. In the

??a calm retro.--pect, at an advanced age, of

PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE.
To the Smote and Eouse of RW c-L,l,a
ThA'ear that has passed sioco the sub
? cvcntiul one i o the country. In the imUH
r?f nvit national prosperity a financial crisis
hnq fvprurrt d that has brought low fortunes
SfStic proportions; political
?iln ins almost erased to exist, especially in
Jhowicul?mlregions;and, tina ly, hocap
? ni'P unon the high seas of a vessel beailn^
our flag ha? for a time threatened the most
serious consequence*, and has agitated t
public mind from one end ol the country to
he other, lint this, "happily, ? *n
the course of satisfactory adjustment,
honorable to both nations concerned.
The relations of the United states, ho\NC\er
with most of -be other l^onttaue to
be friendly and cordial. With a rauee, uer
mVnv ltussiu, Italy, and the minor Eu
ropean Powers, with Brazil and most of the
South American Ut publics, and with Japan,
nothing has occurred during the yeai to de
mand-special notice. The correspondence
between the Department of State and van

those countries is transmitted herewith.
THE VIENNA EXPOSITION. I
In executing the will of Congress as ex
nresscd in it* joint resolution of I lie 1 Mb ?f
February last, and in accordance with the.
provisions of the resolution, a number o
"practical artisans," of <?_ scientific men,"
and of ? lionorary commissioners were au
thorized to attend the Exposition at ^?na
as commissioners on thcpirtof the bniU-d
States. It i> believed that we have obtained
t he object which Congress bad in view when
it parsed the joiut resolution ?' in order t >
enable the people of the United SlAtes to pjr
ticinate in the advantages of the interna
tionul exhibition of the products of agricul
ture, manufactures, and the hue arts to be
held at Vienna." I take pleasure in add

ceived a gratifyiug number of diplomas and
^During the Exposition a conference was
held at Vienna for the puri>ose of consulta
tion on the systems prevailing in different
countiic3 for the protection of inventions.
I authorized a representative from thepat
ent-oflice to be present at \ lcnna at the
time when the conference was to tuke place,
in order to aid a? far as lie might in securing
additional protection to American in\'. nro-s
In Europe. The report ol this agent w ill te
laid before Congress.
CHINA.
It is my pleasant duty to announce
to Congress that the Emperor of China,
on attaining his majority, receded
the diplomatic representatives of the wesi
I em Powers in person. An account of tlioe
1 ceremonies, and of the interesting discus
?ions which pervade them, will be found m
the documents transmitted herewith, Ibe
accompanying papers show that some ad
vance, although slight, has been made mi
ring the past year towards the suppression
of the infamous Chinese coolic traue. I re
commend Congress to inquire

jeet.

which is now held by the Secretary oi state

I.OS3L3 EY CONFEDERATE WAR-VESSELS.
1 renew inv recommendation, made at the
openin'rof the last session of Cougress, that a
commission be created tor the purposeot
auditing and determining the amounts ot the
several " direct losses growing out of the
destruction of vessels and their cargoes - by
the Alabama, the Florida, or the Shenan
doah. after leaving Melbourne, for winch
the sufferers have received no equivalent or
compensation, and of ascertaining the
names of the persons entitled to recede
compensation tor the same, making the
computation upon the basi? indicated by
the tribunal ol arbitration at Genet a, and
that mvinent of such losses be authorized to
an extent not to exceed the awards ol tne
tribunal at Geneva.
BOUNDARIES.
Bv an act approved ou the 14th day
of February lust Congress made provi
sion lor completing, jointly with an ofti
ccr or commissioner to bp named by
herj Britainnc Majesty, the determination
of so much of the boundary line be
tween the territory of the Unite 1 States
and possessions of Great Britain us was left
uncompleted by the commmissiouers ap
pointed under the act of Congress of Au
gust 11, 1850. Under the provisions of this
act the northwestern boundary cf the United
States has boon determined and marked in
accordance with the award ot the Emperor
of Germany. A protocol aud a copy of the
map upon which the line was thus marked
are contained iu the papers submitted here
with.
1 al?o transmit a copy of the report of the
commissioner for marking the norther a
boundary between the United Stales aud
the British possessions west of the Lake of
the Woods, and of i lie operations of the
commission during the past season. Sur
veys have been nude to a point 490 miles
west of the Lake of the Woods, leaving
about 350 miles to be surveyed?the field
work of which can be completed during (lie
next season.
THE MJXF.D COMMISSION.
The mixed commission organized under
the provisions of the Treaty of Washing,
ton lor settling and determining the
claim?, of citizens of either Power
again?t the other arising out of acts
committed against their persons or property
during the period between April 13, 1801,
and April 0,1865, made Its fiual award on
the 25th day of September last. It was
awarded that the Government of the United
States f-hould pay to the Government of her
Britannic Majesty within twelve months
from the date of the award the sum of
?1,929,879 in gold. The commission di-al
lowed or dismissed all other claims of Bri
tish subjects against the United States. The
amount of the claims presented by the Bri
tish Government but disallowed or dis
missed is understood to be about ?93,000,
000. It al-o disallowed ail the claims
of citizens of the United States
against Great Britain which were referred
to it. I recommmd the early jShssage of
an act appropriating the amount necessary
to pay the award against the United States.
I have caused to be communicared to the
Government of the King of Italy the thanks
of this Government fur the eminent services
rendered by Count Costi as the third com
missioner on this commission. With dig
nity, learning, and impartiality he discharged
duties requiring great labor and constant
patience to the satisfaction, I believe, of both
Governments. 1 recommend legislation to
create a special court, to consist of three
judges, who shall be empowered to hear and
determine all claims of aliens upon the
United States arising out of acts com
mitted against "their persons or property
during the insurrection. The recent
reference under.the Treaty of "Washington
was conlined to claims of British suijec-ts
arising during the period named in the
treaty, but it is understood that there are
otber British claims of a similar nature
arising after the 0th of April, 1865, and it is
known that other claims of a like nature are
advanced by citizens or subjects of other
Powers. It is desirable to have these claims
also examined and disposed of.
NEUTRALITY.
Oili'-ijil information being cm-iveil iioin
the Dutch Government of a stare of war be
tween the King of the Netherlands and the
Sultan of Acheen, the ollieers of the United
States who were near the seat of the war
were instructed to observe an impartial neu
trality, It is believed that they have done so.
THE MEXICAN JOINT COMMISSION.
The joiut commi^iou uuder the conven
tion with Mexico of 18GS, having again been
loyally prolonged, has resumed itn business,
which it Is hoped may be brought to an
early conclusion. The distincuished repre
sentative of her Britannic Majesty at Wash
ington lias kincfly consented, with the ap
proval of his Government, to assume the
arduous and responsible duties of umpire in
the commission, ar.d to lend the weight of
his character and name to such decisions as
may not receive the acquiescence of both the
arbitrators appointed by the respective Gov
ernments. The commissioners appointed
pursuant to the authority of Congress to ex
amine into the nature and extent of the fo
rays by trespassers from that country upon
the herds of Texas have made a report,
which will bo submitted for your con
sidcratiou.
VENEZUELA.
The Venezuelan Government has been
apprized of the sen>e of Congress in
regard to the words of the joiut commis
sion under the convention of the 25th of
April, 18GG, as expressed in the act of the
25th of February la?t. It is apprehended
that that Government does not realize the
character of its obligations under that con
vention. As there is reason to believe, how
ever, that its hesitancy in recognizing them
springs, in part at least, from real difficulty
in discharging them in connection with
it* obligations to other Governments, the ex
pediency of further forbearance on our part
i.s believed to be worthy of your considera
tion.
TCRELY AND EGYrT.
The Ottoman Government and that of
Egypt have shown a disposition to relieve
foreign consuls of the judicial powers which
heretofore they have exercised in the Turk
ish dominions by organizing other tribunals.
As Congress, however, has by law provided
for the discharge of judicial functions by
consuls ot' the United States in that quarter
under the treaty of 1830,1 have not felt at
liberty formally to accept the proposed
change without the assent of Congress,
whose decision upon the subject at as early
a period as may be convenient is earnestly
requested.
PANTO DOMINGO.
I transmit herewith for the consideration
and determination of Congress an applica
tion of the Republic of Santo Domingo to
this Government to exercise a protectorate
over that Republic.
TREATIES mOCLAIMED.
Since the adjournment of Congress the fol
lowing treaties with foreign Powers have
been proclaimed: A naturalization conven
tion with Denmark; a convention with
.Mexico fur receiving the claim* commission ;
a oouvention of friendship, commerce, and
extradition with the Orange free State ; and
a naturalization convention with Ecuador.
J renew the recommendation made in my
mess:*,'C of December, 1370, that Congress
authorize the Tost master-General to i-sue ull
commissions to ollicials appointed through
hi.Department.
EXPATRIATION AND TflE ELECTION OF NATION
ALITY BY INDIVIDUALS.
I invite the earnest attention of Congress
to the existing laws of the United States re
specting expatri ation and the election of na
tionality by individuals. Many citizen of
the United States reside permanently abroad
r with their families under the provisions of
i be net approved February 10th, 1S55. The
children of such persons are to be deemed
and taken to be citizens of the United
States, but the rights of citizenship are
uot to descend to persons who.se lathers
never resided in the JL'nitcd States.
It thus happens that persons who have
never resided within the United Slates have
been enabled to put forward a pretension to
the protection of the United States against
the claim to military service of the Govern
ment under whose protection they were
born and have been reared. In some eases,
even naturalized citizens of the United
State:* have returned to the land of their
birth, with intent to remain there, and their
children, the issue of a marriage contracted
there after their return, and who have
never been in the Uniicd States, have laid j
claim to our protection, when the lup-e of
many years has imposed upon them the duty
of military service to the only Government
which had ever known them personally.
Until the year 180S it was left embarrassed
by conflicting opinions of courts and of ju
rists to determine how far the decline of
pt rpetnal allegiance derived from our former
colonial reJatious with Great Britain was
applicable to Jfmerican citizens. Cor.
^rews then wisely swept these doubts away
by enacting that "Any declaration, instruc
tion, opinion, order, or decisiou of any oili
cer of this Government which denies, re
stricts. impairs, or questions the right
of expatriation is inconsistent with
the fundamental principles of this Gov
ernment"; but Congress did not indicate
in that statute, nor has it .-inee done so, what
acts are to be desired to work expatriation.
For my own guidance in determining such
questions I required, under the provisions of
the Constitution, the opinion, in writing, of
the principal officer in each of the Execu
tive Departments upon certain questions re
lating to this subject. The result satisfies
me that further legislation has become ne
cessary. I therefore commend the subject
to the careful consideration of Congress, and
I transmit herewith copies of the. several
opiniousof the principal ofllcers of the Ex
ecutive Departments, together with other
correspondence and pertinent, information on
the same subject. The United States, who led
the way in the overthrow of the feudal doc- j
trine of perpetual allegiance, are among the
last to indicate how their own citizens mav
elect another nationality. The papers sub
mitted herewith indicate what is necessary
to pl ace us on a par with other leading na
tions in liberality of legislation on this inter
national question. We have already in our
treaties assented to the principles which
would need to be embodied in laws intended
to accomplish such results. We have agreed
that citizens of the United States may rise
to be citizens, and may voluntarily render al
legiance to other Towers. We have agreed
that residence in a foreign land without i li
tem to return shall of itself work expatri
ation. We have agreed in some instances
upon the length of time necessary for such
continued residence to work a presumption
of such intent. 1 invite Congre-a now to
mark out and define when aud how expatria
tion can be accomplished, to regulate by law
the condition ol American women marrying
foreigners, to fix the status of children born
in a toreign country of American parents
residing more or less permanently abroad,
and to make rules for determining such
other kindred points as may seem host to
Congress.
STAIN.
In compliance with the request of Con
gress I transmitted to the American Minis
ter at Madrid, with instructions to present to
to the Spanish Government, the joint reso
lution approved on the 3d of March last
tendering to the people of Spain in the name
and on behalf 01 the American people the
congratulations of Congress upon the efforts
to consolidate in Spain the principles of uni
versal liberty in a republican form of gov
ernment. The existence o*' this new repub
lic was inaugurated by striking the fetters
from the slave* in Porto Kico. This benefi
cent measure was followed by the release of
several thousand persons illegally held as
slaves in Cuba. Next, the Captain-General
of that colony was deprived of the power to
set aside the orders of his superiors at Ma
drid, which had pertained to the office since
1S25. The sequestered estates of American
citizens, which had been the cause of long
and fruitless correspondence, were ordered
to be restored to their owners. All these
liberal steps were taken iu the face of a
violeut opposition directed by the re
actionary slaveholders of Havana, who
are vainly striving to stay the march
of idcaS which has terminated slavery
in Christendom, Cuba only excepted. Un
happily, however, this banefnl influence has
thus lar succeeded in defeating the efforts of
all liberal-minded men In Spain to abolish
slavery in Cuba, and in preventing the pro
mised reform in that inland. The struggle
for political supremacy continues there. The
pro-slavery and aristocratic party in Cuba is
gradually arraigning itseli iu more and more
open hostility and deliauceof the Home Gov
ernment, while it still maintains a political
connection with the republic in the penin
sula; and although usurping and defying the
authority of the Homo Government when
cvr such usurpation or defiance^ tends in
the direction of oppression or of:the main
tenance of abuses it is still a ,n 1 J
drld and is recognized by the Government.
Thus an element more dangerous to con
tinued colonial relations between Cuba and
Spain than that which inspired the Insurrec
tion at Yara-au element opposed to grant
ing any relief from misrule and anuse, with
no aspirations after freedom, commanding
no sympathies in generous breasts, aiming j
to rivet still stronger the shackle* of slavery
aud oppression?has seized many of the em
blems of power in Cuba, and undec profes
sion of loyalty to the mother country is ex
hausting the resources of the island, and is
doing acts which are at variance with those
principles of justice, of liberty, and of right,
which give nobility of character to a repub
lic in the* interests of humanity, of civiliza
tion, and of progress. It is to be hoped that
this evil influence may be soon averted.
THE CUBAN TR0UBLE3.
The steamer Virginius was on the 2Gth
day of September, WTO, duly registered at
the port of New York as a part ut tue com
mercial marine of the United States. On
the 4th of October, 1870, having received tue
certificate of her register in the usual legal
form, she sailed from the port of >ew York,
and has not since been within the territorial
jurisdiction of the United States. On the
?31st day of October last, while sailing under
the flag of the United States on the high
sea*, she was forcibly seized l^y the Spanish
"unboat Tornado, and was carried into the
port of Santiago de Cuba, where many of
her passengers and crew were inhumanly,
and so far ?t least ns relates to those who
were citizens of the United Slates, without
due process of law, put to death.
It is a well-established principle, asserted
bv the United States from the beginning of
their national independence, recognized by
Great Britain and other maritime Powers,
and stated by the Seuate in a resolution
passed unanimously on the lGth of June,
1858 that "American vessels on the biftu
Fcas, in time of peace, bearing the Amen can
flag, remain uudcr the jurisdiction o the
country to which they belong, and the. >
fore any visitation, molestation, or detention
of such vessel by force or by the exhibition
of force on the part of a foreign Power is in
derogation of the sovereignty of the United
" in "accordance with this principle, the
restoration of the Virginius and the surren
der of the survivors of her passengers and
crew and a due reparation to the flag and the
punishment of the authorities who had been
guilt v of the illegal acts of violence were
demanded. The Spnuish Government has
recognized the justice of the demand and
lias arranged for the immediate delivery of
the vessel and for the surreuder of the sur
vivors of the passengers aud crew and for a
salute to the flag aud for proceedings look
ing to the punishment of those who may be
proved to have been guilty ot illegal acts of
violence towards citizens of the United
States, and also towards indemnifying those
who mav be shown to be entitled to indem
nity. A copy of a protocol of a confercnce
between the Secretary of State aud the
Spauish Minister, in which the terms of this
arrangement were agreed to, is transmitted
herewith.
The correspondence on this subject with
the legatiou ot the United Slates in Madrid
was conducted in cypher and by cable, aud
needs the verification of the actual text ot
the correspoudeuce. It has seemed to me
to be due to the importance of the ca.-e not
to submit thU correspondence until the ac
curate text can be received by mail. It is
expected shortly, aud will be submitted
when received. > .
In taking leave of this subject tor the
present 1 wi^b to renew the expression of
my conviction that the existence of Alrican
slavery in Cuba is a principal cause ot the
lamentable condition of the island. I do not
doubt that Congre's shares with me the
hope that it will be soon made to disappear,
and peace and prosperity may follow Us abo
lition.
The embargoing of American estates in
Cuba, cruelty to American citizens detected
in no act of hostility to the Spanish Govern
ment, the murdering of prisoners taken with
arms in their hands, and, finally, the capture
iipjn the high sea* of a vessel sailing under
the United States flag and bearing a United
States registry, has culminated in an out
burst of indignation that has seemed for a
time to threaten war. Pending negotiations
between the United Slates and the Govern
ment of Spain on the subject of this cap
ture I have authorized the Secretary of the
Saw to put our navy on a war footing to
the extent at least of the cutirc annual ap
propriation for that branch ot the service,
trusting to Congress and the public opinion
of the American people to justify my ac
tion. ?
PROPOSED AMENDMENTS TO TFIE CONSTITUTION.
Assuming from the action of the last
Congress iu appointing a committee on
** Privileges and Elections" to prepare and
report to this Congress a constitutional
amendment to provide a better method of
electing the President and Vice-President of
the United States, and also from the neces
sity for such an amendment, that there will
be* submitted to the Slate Legislatures for
ratification such improvement in our Con
stitution, I suggest two others for your
consideration: First?To authorize the Ex
ecutive to approve of so much ot any mea
sure passing the two Houses of Congress as
his judgment may dictate without approv
ing the whole, the disapproved por
tion or portions to be subjected to the
same rules as now?to wit, to be referred
back to the House in which the measure or
measures originated, and if passed by a
two-thirds vote of the two Houses, then to
become a law without the approval of the
President. I would add to this a provision
that there should be no legislation by Con
gress during the last twenty-four hours of
its sitting except upon vetoes, in order to
give the Executive an opportunity to exam
ine aud approve or disapprove bills under
standingly.
Second?To provide by amendment that
when an extra session of Congress is con
vened by Executive proclamation, legislation
during "the continuance of such extra ses
sion shall be confined to such subjects as the
Executive may bring before it Irom time to
time iu writing.
The advantages to be gained by these two
amendments are obvious. One session in
each year is provided for by the Consti
tution", in which there are no restrictions as
to the subjects of legislation by Congress.
If more are required, it is always in the
power of Congress during their term of
oflice to provide for sessions at any time.
The tirst of these amendments would protect
the public against the many abuses and vra-te
ot public moneys winch creep into appro
priation bills and other important measures
passing during the expiring hours of Con
gress, to which otherwise due consideration
cannot be given.
RECEIPTS AND EXPENDITURES.
The receipts ot the Government front all
sources lor the last tiscal year were &ioo,
7GS,2U4. and expenditures on all accounts
$20U,3-io,2-1.3; thus showing an excess of re
ceipts over expenditures of $13,892,959. liut
it is not probable that this favorable exhibit
will be shown for the pre?ent fiscal year.
Indeed, it is very doubtful whether, except
with great ccouumy on the pjrt of Congress
in making appropriations, aud the same
economy Iu administering the various de
partments of Government, the revenues
will not fall short of meeting actual ex
penmen, including interest on the public debt.
I commend to Congress inch economy,
and point out two sources where it seems
to me it might commrnce?to wit, in thoap
propriations for public buildings iu the many
cities where work has not yet been coin
menced ; in the appropriations for river aud
harbor improvements in those localities
where the improvements are of but little
benelit to general commerce, aud for j'ortid
eations. There is a still more fruitful source
of expenditure, which 1 wdl point out liter
in this message. I refer to the easy method ,
of manufacturing claims for losses incurred
hi suppressing the late rebelliou. 1 would
not be understood here its opposiug the erec
tion of good, substantial, and even ornamen
tal buildings by the Government wherever
such buildings are needed. Iu fact, I ap
prove of the Government owning its own
buildings in all sect lotos of the country, aud
hope the day is opt far distant when it will
not only possess tUcin, but will erect iu the
Capital suitable residences for all persons
who dow receive commutation for quar
tern, or r6nt at Government expense,
and. for tbe Cabinet, thus 'letting an exam
ple to tbf States which may induce them to
erect buildings for their senator?. But i
would have this work conducted at a time
when the revenues of the country would
abundantly justify it*" v
REVEMTES?TAB CCBRENCY.
The revenues have materially fallen
off for the first five mouths of the
prdsent fiscal yeir from what they
were expected to produce, owing to
the general panic now prevailing, which
commenced about tbe middle of September.
The full effect of this disaster, if it should
not prove a blessing in disguise, i? yet to be
demonstrated. In either event it is your
duty to heed the lesson, and to provide by
wise and well-considered legislation, as far as
it lies in your power, against its recurrence,
and to take advantage of all benefits that
may have accrued. My own judgment is
that however much individuals may
have suffered, one long step has been t iken
towards specie payments; that we can
never have permanent prosperity until a fair
basis is reached, and that a ^flecie btsis can
not be reached and maintained until our ex
ports, exclusive of gold, pay for our imports,
interest due abroad, and other specie obliga
tions', or so nearly so as to leave an appre
ciative accumulation of the precious metal in
tbe country from tbe products of our mines.
The development of the mines of precious
metals during tbe past year, and the pros
pective development of them for years to
come, are gratifying in their results. Could
but one-halt' of the pold extracted from the
mines be retained at home our advance to
wards specie payments would be rapid. To
iucrease our exports sufficient currency is
required to keep all the industries of "the
country employed. Without, this, national
as well as Individual bankruptcy must
ensue. More inflation, on tbe other
hand, while it might give temporary
relief, would only lead to iullation of price/,
the impossibility of competing in our own
markets for the products of home skill and
abor, and repeated renewals of present ex
periences. Elasticity to our circulating me
dium, therefore, and just enough of it to
transact the legitimate business of the coun
try and to keep all industries employed, is
what is most to be desired. The exact me
dium is specie?the recognized medium of
exchange the world over. That obtained,
we shall have a currcncy of an exact degree
of elasticity. If there be too much ot it for
the legitimate purposes of trade and com
merce it will flow out of tbe country. If
too little, the reverse will result. To hold
what we have aud to appreciate our cur
rency to that standard is a problem deserv
ing of the most serious consideration of Con
ress. The experience of the present panic
as proven that the currency of the country,
based as it is upon the credit of the country,
> the best that has ever been devised.
Usually in times of such trials currency has
become worthless, or so much depreciated in
due as to iutlute the values of all tbe nc
?ssaries of life as compared with the cur
ency. Every one holding it has been anx
ious" to dispose of it on any terms. Now
we witness the reverse. Holders of cur
rency hoard it as they did gold in former
experiences of a like uature.
It is patent to the most causuai oo.*erver
that much more currency or money is re
quired to transact the legitimate trade of
the country during tho rail and winter
mouths, when the vast crops are being re
moved, than during the balauce of the year.
With our present system the amount in the
country remains the same throughout the
entire year, resulting in aceuniulationof all
the surplus capital of thecountrv in a few
centres when not employed iu themovin" of
crops, tempted there by the offer of interest
on call loans. Inter cat being paid, this
surplus capital must earn this interest
paid with a profit. Being subject to
" call, ? it cannot be loaned, onlv
iu part at least, to the merchant or mantifac-l
turer for a fixed term. Hence, no matter!
I how much currency there might he in the I
country it would be absorbed, prices keep 1
j mg pace with the volume, and panics, >trin-1
genev, and disasters would ever he rceurrin"
with Uio autumn. Elasticity in our mone"5
tary system, therefore, is the object to be ob
j tamed tirst, and next to that, as far as possi
ble, a prevention of the use of other peo
ple's. money in stock and other species ot
speculation. To prevent the latter it seems
to me that one great step would be taken bv
prohibiting the national banks from paviu
i interest on depo>its, by requiring them to
j hold their reserves in their own vaults, and
! by forcing them into resumption thoti"h it
would only be in le-al-tender notes. For
thi< purpose I would suggest the establish
ment ol^ clearing-houses for your considera
tion. To secure the former manv plans
have been suggested, most if not all of which
look to me more like inflation on the one
hand, or compelling the Government on the
other to pay interest, without corre*pond
ing benefits, upon the surplus funds of the
I country during the .seasons when otherwise
unemployed. I submit for your considera
tion whether this difficulty miuht not be
overcome by authorizing the Secretary of
the Treasury to issue, at any time, to na
tional banks ol l-sue, any amount of!
their own notes below a fixed per-i
centage of their issue?say forty per cent.?
upon the banks depositing with the
icasurer of the Lnitcd States an amount
of Government bonds equal to the amount
of notes demanded, the banks to forfeit to
the Government bonds equal to the amount
of notes demanded, the banks to forfeit to
the Government s.iy four per cent, of the
interest accruing on the bonds so pledged
during the time they remaiu with the Trea
surer as security fur the increased circula
tion, the bonds so pled-,Ned to be redeemable
b> the banks at their pleasure, either in
whole or in part, by returning their own
! 'or cancellation to an amount equal to
the ace of the bonds withdrawn. 1 would
further suggest for your consideration the
proprjety ot authorizing national banks to
1 ? / st;,utli,1S lit pleasure
i VuU,ng .r cancellation their ovvn bills
ana withdrawing so many United States
bonds as are pledged for the bills returned
In view of the great actual contraction
that has taken place iu the eurreuev, and
the comparative contraction contiuiiouslv
going on, due to the increase of population
increase of manufactories and all the
industries, I do not believe there is too
much ot it now for the dullest period of the
S'. iUfjec,c;-if clearing-houses should be
i >la bhr-hed, thus forcing redemption, it is
a question for your consideration whether
sfboul(l l10t bo made frce> retaining |
bin hoi#?? *t U0VV rrtiuirc(1 10 secure
i bill-luldirs. In any modification of the pre-!
i sent laws regulating national banks, as a fur
icr step towards prepuritig for resumption
ot speoic payments, I invite your attention to
a consideration ot the propriety of exact in"
tromi them the retention as a part ot their
I e cither the whole or u put of the
gold-iutercst accruing upon the bonds
pledged as security tor their issue. I have
uot reflected enough on the bearing this
might have In producing a scarcity of coin
with which to pay duth* on imports to
give it my positive recommendation, but
your attention is invited to the subjee'

legal-tenders in the bank reserves to I
the extent of sixty-three millions of dollars.
During the same i>erlod there has been a
much larger comparative contraction of the
ctiiienc). j he population of the country
has largely increased. More than twenty
jive thousand miles of railroad have been
built, requiring the active use of capital to
operate them. Millions of acres of land have

CHEAP TRANSPORTATION
is a subject that ba< attracted tbe attention of
both producers and consumers for the na<f
few years, and has contributed to, if it ha?
not been the direct cause of, the recent pini.?
and stringency. As Congress at il, last ^
M,?i\ ?fiP? .e(!il s^'c,al cornm>"ee to inves
tigate this whole subject during the vacation
and report at this session, I have notbin" to
recommend until their report is read. There
is one work, however, of a national charac.
tcr in which tbe greater portion of the Ea>t
and the West, the North and the South arc
equally interested, to which I will invito
your attention.
State of 2nc\\ York has a canal con
necting Luke Erie with tide-water on the
; Hudson river. The State of Illinois hxs a
similar work connecting Lake Michigan
with navigable water on the Illinois river
thus making water communication inland
between the East and the West and South
Those great artificial water-courses are the
property of the States through which*tb*y
pass, and pay toll to those States. Would it
not be wise statesmanship to pledge tlio*
Stales that if they will open the-e canals tor
the passage of large vessels the Gencra/Gov
I ernmeut will look after and keep in navigable
j condition tbe great public hi^tuvays'wUh
which they con nec:?to wit: thcoverMwh
on tbe Hudson, the St. Clair Hits, and the
Illinois and Mississippi rivers? Tin's woul i
be a nation il work, and one of great value
to the producers of the West and South iti
giving them cheap transportation for their
produce to tbe seaboard and a market, snd
to the consumers in the East in giving them
cheaper food, particularly of those articles of
food which do not tind a foreign market and
the prices of which therefore are not rcu
Iated by foreign dewmd. The advantages
ot such a work are too obvious for argu
[ meat. I submit the subject to you, there
fore, without further comment.
In attempting to regain our lost coalmen e
and curving trade I have heretofore called
attention to the States south oi us as oll'erioz
a field where much might be accomplished.
To further this object 1 suggest that a small
; appropriation be made, accompanied with
authority for the Secretary of the Xavv fo
tit out a naval vessel to ascend the Amazon
river to tbe mouth of the Madeira; theno*
to explore that river and its tributaries into
Bolivia, and to report to Congress at it.- urxt
session, or as soon as practicable, the access
bility of the country by water, it-; resource*,
and the population so reached. Such an e\'
ploration willTOst but little. Item do no
harm, and may result in establishing a trad^
of value to both nation?.
In further connection with the Treasury
Departnieut I would recommend a revision
ana codification of the tarid' laws and the
opening of more mints for coining mono v.
with authority to coin for such nations as
may apply.
WAB DEPARTMENT.
The attention of Congress is invited toili"
recommendations contained in the report of
the Secretary of War, herewith accompany
jog. The apparent ijre.it cost uf suppoitiu^
the army is fully explained by this report,
and 1 hope will receive your attention.
While iuviting your general attention to
all recommendation1- m ide by the Secretary
ot" War, there are two which 1 would ci?e
ciallv invite you to consider : First, the im
portance of preparing for war in time of
peace by providing proper armament for
our sea-coast defences. Proper armament
is of vastly more importance than fortifica
tions. The latter can be supplied very
speedilv for teoijwrary purposes when need
ed; the former cannot. The second is the
necessity of reopening promotion in the staff
cofps of the army. Particularly is this ne
cessity felt in the medical, pay, and ord
nance departments. At this tiuie it is neces
sary to employ contract surgeons to supply
the" necessary medical attendance required
by the army. ? W itli the present force ot the
Pay Department it is now difficult to mike
the payments to troops provided for by lav\.
Long delays in paymeuts are productive ot
desertions and other demoralization, ami Un
law prohibits the payment of troops by other
than regular paymasters.
There are sixteen vacancies in tlif Ord
nance Department, thus leaving that branch
of the service without sufficient olikers to
conduct the business of Hip different arsenals
on a large scale, if ever required.
NAVY DEPARTMENT.
During the last year our navy ha- beeu
depleted by the sale ol some vessels n<>
longer lit for naval service, and by the con
demnation of others not yet disposed ol.
This, however, has been more than compen
sated for by the repair of six of the old
wooden ships and the building of eight new .
sloops-of-war authorized by the !a-t Con
gress. The building of these latter has oc
curred at a doubly fortunate time. They are
about beiun completed at a time when they
may possibly be much needed, aud the work
upon them has not only given direct em
ployment to thousands of men, but has no
doubt, beeu the mean* of keeping op*u
establishments for other work at a time of
great financial distress.
since the commencement of the last
month, however, the distressiuu occurrences
which have taken place in the waters ot the
Caribbean >ea, almost ou our very seaboard,
while they illustrate most forcibly the neces
sity always exi-ling that a nation like ours
should maintain in a state ot possible effi
ciency a navy adequate to its responsibility's,
have at the same time demanded that all the
effective force wo really have shall be put in
immediate readiness lor warlike services
This has been and is being done promptly
and effectively, and I am assured that ail the
availably ships and every authorized man
of the American navy will J*' ready tor
whatever action is required for the wfet)
of our citizens or the maintenance ot our
honor. This, of course, will require the
expenditure in a short time of some ot the
appropriations which were calculated to ex
tend through the fiscal year: but Congress
will, I doubt not, understand and appreci
ate the emergency, aud will proUde ade
quately not only for the present prepara
tion, but for the fUture maintenance of our
uaval force. The Secretary of the Navy has,
during the past year, beeu quietly putting
some ol our most effective monitors in con
dition for service, aud thus the exigency
finds us in a much better condition lor work
than we could possibly have beeu without
this action.
