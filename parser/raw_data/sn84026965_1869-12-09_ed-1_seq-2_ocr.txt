2t" . iTHH CHARLESTON HOTEL.
dl .... . , i
?; This favorite resort of the travelling public is
now enjoying a just reward.for the ifnergy and as?
siduity of its present management. A recent so?
journ within its spacious walls enable us to bear
testimony to tbe splendid arrangement .of its va?
rious departments, and we. can truthfully declare
that ander no'former management has there been
greater and more successful effort; to please its
patrons. Mr. E. H. Jackson, the proprietor, .has
a careful supervision of the entire establishment,
while our old and excellent friend, Chablie Mil
lee, for eighteen years connected with the house,
Is always at his post, and is ably seconded by Asa
Bsttebfield, formerly of the Pavilion. The
Charleston Hotel has been lately renovated from
cellar to garret, and has put on a brighter outward
appearance. In short, in furniture, table comforts
and hospitable treatment, the Charleston is not ex?
celled in any Southern city, and we doubt if there
i . better j^nd more comfortable living anywhere on
this continent. Any of our friends visiting the
"city hy the sea" are recommended to give it a
trial.
Brief Ml-ntiox.?A new society is said to have
been recently organized in this place under the
name of,"Fay .Nothing," and has already become
alarmingly prosperous. The pass-word is "Lend
me a Dollar," and the response, "Broke." To our
extreme mortification and regret, the majority of j
oar village subscribers have joined,, the society.
Moj. John- B. Moore has kindly furnished us
-with a pamphleteopy of the Governor's Message,
for which he will accept our thanks.
A small lot of Tennessee hogs was sold in this
phice last week for 12 J cents gross.

The Atlanta (Geo.) Intelligencer states that on
Friday last a number of people from Anderson
District parsed through that city on their way to
Texas. Our cotemporary must be mistaken as to
their destination, as we know of only oue party-of |
emigrants from hare recently, and they were mov?
ing to Alabama, we believe.
A considerable amount of "morphine" was con?
sumed on last Monday, and it was not confined to
the-white raoe either. We observed several bel?
ligerent darkies under its influence. The town
authorities ire'certainly lenient in their treatment
of such cases.
The sales on Monday attracted a large crowd of j
people, and the bidding was often spirited and ex?
citing. A goodly amount of trade enlivened the
merchants nnd business men, and altogether the
day was brisk and lively.

THE CHJJILE8T0:? NEWS AND THE BITTE
RIDGE BAUBOAO.
We hare no. disposition to. engage ic controvesy
with any of Mtr cote aporaries, and especially upon j
subjects where each one must admit that tbe other
is actuated by equally worthy motives as itself.
But the recent attitude of the Charleston News to?
wards the Bine Ridge Railroad calls for a fair
share of criticism, and we cannot allow the occa?
sion te pass altogether without expressing our dis?
sent from its course. In a lengthy article, pub?
lished two weeks since, the News undertakes to
" blow its own horn " in a rather offensive man?
ner, as we conceive it, to the friendii of the Blue
Ridge Road of whatever party. It has likewise
for some months past endeavored to make the
question of State aid to this importing Railroad
savor too much of politics, and in the article above
referred to it would create the impression that the
News lias dealt unmerciful blows to the Radical
party by opposing the contract with Creswell &
Co., and raising a clamor against the Road?the
practical results of ivh ich tend to an abandonment
of the enterprise, iL' the adviee of the News was
carried out.- Now, we cannot possibly be charged
with any jealous motive in arraigning the News at
the bar of public opinion for its opposition to the
Blue Ridge Road, as there can be no conflict of in?
terest bdtwcten an enterprising daily and an obscure
country sheet. Heaeo, when that journal Beeks to
gain notoriety by landing its own Conduct in this
or any o&bor respect, this self-glorification does
not affect ns one way or the other. . But, to onr
> mind, this hasty assumacy on the part of the News
is totally at .variance with the true interests of the
State, and on this ground alone is the conduct of
the News brought ia question. It may be that the
State officials were interested with the contractors,
as has been repeatedly charged by the News, but
we respectfully submit that the sequence to this
contract do as not furnish evidence to that effect.
If Gov. Scott mado arrangements to obtain a nice
little, job; with these contractors, it is somewhat
singular that he should be among the first to re
I llnquish and advise a discontinuance of the con?
tract, on the ground that these contractors had not
complied with the conditions therein expressed.
But the' truth is, that the contract made with
Creswell & Co. required the sanction of a major?
ity of the Executive Committee, of which Gov.
Scott was a member, and that the remaining
members present were two well-known citizens of
this State, who have been long identified with the
Road, and whose: connection therewith dates far'
ther back than the existence of the News, or even
the knowledge of its editors that such a Road was
contemplated. One, of them, President Harrison,
has been largely interested in a pecuniary sense
from tbe inception of this enterprise until the
present time, and it is not likely that his conduot
was influenced by tbe dictation of Gov. Scott or
any other individual. The manner of awarding
this contract was fully and satisfactorily explained
last summer, when these wholesale charges first
appeared in the News, and we are surprised that
such stale allegations are again paraded before the
public.
It is unnecessary fords to declare "final we have
no love for Radical office-holders in this State.
The past is a guarantee of our position in this re
: gard. and the antecedents of the Inlelliffeneer may
be safely compared to those of any of its co tempo?
raries. But we do love justice, and have never
yet withheld it even from an enemy. We will
heartily join the News in exposing rascality of ev?
ery sort in these officials, but we can never allow
our prejudices to outweigh judgment, for the pur?
pose of creating a sensation.
We have no doubt that the Board 0!' Directors
can, at the proper lime, satisfy the public mind
that the contract with Cbeswell & Co. was advan?
tageous to the company at the time it was made,
and that they now have sufficient reasons for their
recent action in withdrawing from said contract.
It is enough to say, so far as the Charleston pub?
lic is concerned, that the Directors residing in that
city, old and hew, approved the contract made
with these gentlemen, and that tho recent action
of the Board was entirely unanimous.
The adjustment of the differences b-rtweem the
Company and the contractors has been under ad?
visement during the past week, and it is stated
that the Directors have agreed to pay seventy-five
thousand dollars, which has been agreed to by the
contractors and all claims withdrawn. It is sup?
posed that they hod done about fifteen or twenty
thousand dollars' worth of work on the Road.
The work will be continued, with the funds now in
the hands of the Company, until the $4,000,000
appropriated by the Legislature bas been expen?
ded. This is the plan originally advocated by the
President and Chief Engineer, and is the most
feasible and economical, in our judgment, although
the advantages of an sarly completion of the en?
terprise which induced the contract with Ores
well & Go. are to some extent diminished by this
result. We hope to announce at an early day that
the work is progressing nnder tbe direction of the
Chief Engineer, and that all needless opposition to
the Road has been effectually silenced.

Thursday night in Abbeville county, by constable

killing him instantly. He refused to be arrested,
and shot Hollingshed twice, wounding that officer
in the thigh and groin.

contract to Gainesville, and our Atlanta friends aro
hopeful of an early completion of this important

ous measures will be inaugurated next year to?

Distriot in 1774, departed this life on the 20th of
November last, in Pierce oounty, Ga. She lived
122 years, 10 months, and 8 days, enjoying good

without any assistance.
? The Greenville Mountaineer will resume pub?
lication in January next, under the management

to whom we extend good wishes for his success.
NEWS FROM WASHINGTON".
The second sessionuof the Forty-First Congress
began on Monday, last.". The annual message of
[the President, together with the reports of the va?
rious departments, are announced as ready for
transmission when the-.two houses are prepared
for business; but contrary to custom, President
Grant will not allow his message to be made pub?
lic until it is delivered to Congress. It is believed
that he will favor the immediate resumption of
specie payment and a/recognition of the belliger?
ent rights of the Cuban insurgents?two of the
most important questions likely to be discussed
during the present session.
Gen. Sherman, in his report on army affairs,
advises against a reduction of its strength, and
Bays that in some portions of the Southern coun?
try a state of anarchy would at once ensue, if the
troops now stationed there should be withdrawn.
In regard to finances, the indications point to
the passage of a law authorizing the inauguration)
of a froo banking system thronghont the country.
Under the present management of finances, the
West is unjustly deprived of banking capital, and
that powerful section will demand a more equitable
distr i bu t ion of the government patronage. Indeed,
it is clear that the day is rapidly approaching
when the West and the South will become united
in opposition to the selfish policy of New England,
and will break the fetters long since forged by pro?
tective tariffs, and other legislation ? intended to
benefit tho "loyal" Puritans.
Later.?Since the above was put in type, we
have received a brief telegraphic synopsis of the
President's Message, which has been delivered to
Congress. He recommends the prompt admission
of Senators and Representatives from Virginia,
and hopes that the results in Mississippi and Texas
are such as to meet the approval of Congress.
Ho suggests the continuance of tax on incomes,
but at reduced rates?say three per cent., and the
tax to expire in three.years. He says that the im?
mediate resumption of specie payments is not de-,
airable, though it should be reached at the earliest
moment consistent with a fair regard for the debt?
or class. He recommends such legislation as will
insure a gradual return to specie payments ; and
to end the fluctuation in currency values, he sug?
gests that authority be given to the Treasury to
redeem its own paper, at a fixed price, whenever
presented, and to withhold from circulation all cur- j
rency so redeemed, until sold again for gold. The
natural resources, developed and undeveloped,
should make our credit the best in the world, and
the debt could be paid in ten years; but it is not
desirable that the people should be t&xed'to pay in
thai. time.
As the United States is the freest of all nations,
so, too, its people sympathize with all people
struggling for liberty aud self-government, but
while sympathizing is to our honor, we should re?
frain from enforcing our views upon unwilling na?
tions, and from taking ar>, interested part, without
invitation, in the quarrels betweon different na?
tions, or between Governments and their subjects.
Oar coarse should strictly conform with strict jus?
tice and international and local law. Such has
been the object of the Administration in dealing
with thee e questions. Regarding Cuba, he says,
notwithsianding the warm sympathy entertained
for her contest, at no time has she assumed the
conditions which would indicate the existence of a
de facto political organization of the insurgents,
sufficient to justify a recognition of belligerency.
The principle is maintained, however, that this
nation is its own judge when to accord the right
of belligerency, either to a people struggling to
free themselves from a Government they bclicvo
oppressive, or to independent nations at war with
each other. The United States have no disposition
to interfere with the existing relations of Spain to
her colonial possession.

g REPORT
OF THE COUNTY COMMISSIONERS.
OFFICE OF COUNTY COMMISSIONERS, \
Anderson C. H., S. C. /
Tub County Commissioners of Anderson Coun?
ty beg leave, in presenting their Aral report, to
stato that, on ontoring on tho discharge of their
duties, thoy found the Hoard of Commissioners of
the Poor in debt $1029.56. Under the changed
order of things, the number of paupers have
greatly inoreasod in tho last four years, Tho av?
erage number for tho past yoar has been about
80ven?y-fivc. A great many hove boen brought
there only in time to receive modical attention,
nursing, &o., and to bo decently buried. Tho
Commissioners havo tried to make it an asylum
worthy of the couuty, where the helpless infant,
the old and infirm, and the idiotic, are all provi?
ded for. They- have been comfortably clothed,
well fed and lodged, and.a proper regard in every
reBpect had for their tfoiflfort, which we doubt not
ia the wish of a large proportion of the tax-pay?
ers. And on the other hand, We have had a due
regard to the interest of the tax-payers, as the
expenditures will show. The current expenses of
the institution have been met. by purchases on
short time?till taxes were collected. The former
indebtedness and expenses of the year have all
been paid by drafts on the County Treasurer. The
highest encomium we can pass on Mr. Hembree,
tbe Steward, and his wife, as to their management
of the institution, is to state the actual expenses
for the year just-ondcd,_including board, clothing,,
blankets, shoes, tobacco for the old, medical bill,
funeral expenses (decent interment, always re?
quired) for the dead, salary of the Steward, and
all other necessary expenses, is less than three
dollars per month per head for the paupers,
amounting in all to $2439.56.
There have been in the Lunatic Asylum in Co?
lumbia during the past year, seven' pauper luna?
tics at the expense of the county, as rendered to
this time, $1010.88.
The roads we found in bad order, and have done
the best we could under, existing1 laws. Should
the recommendation of the Convention of County.
Commissioners to the Legislature be adopted, and
additional powers given County Commissioners,
the roads could be put in order at an early day.
The Public Buildings are in good order, and
supplied with all necessary books, and an iron
safe for the Clerk's office, all at an expense of I
$325.00. Tbe indebtedness of the Commissioners
of Public Buildings, which has been paid,
