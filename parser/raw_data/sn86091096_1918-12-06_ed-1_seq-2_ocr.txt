No Building Restrictions
Since the removal of all building restrictions we
can look forward to an unprecedented activity in the
building industry. An assurance ot good prices for
grain and plenty of help at harvest time ought to
diminish the worry. Put on that smile and pass it
along.

Turkeys are active foragers and

will pick up a greater part of their
food, which is far better for them than
that which is given them, and is ot
considerable value.

It is remarkable'how quietly busi
ness has re-adjusted itself all over
the country from a war basis to a
peace basis. After such a long per
iod of destructive warfare it is sur
prising that business conditions
should remain on such an apparent
ly solid footing. President Wilson
stated in his message to Congress
that the American business man
was equal to the situation of recon
struction and that business would
come back to normal with very lit
tle assistance from the Government.
Labor will be absorbed into the var
ious activities of the country as fast
as demobilization takes place in
the army. It will have a less dis
astrous effect upon industry to find
employment for these men when
they are dismissed from the service
than it had to call them so suddenly
from their various occupations all
over the country. The period of
reconstruction promises a healthy
resumption of business activity.
A Communication was received
from the war industries board stat
ing that on and after December 1,
1918, the rules of the war industries
board governing weekly newspapers
will Lie withdrawn. It also states
that their action is prompted by the
fact that the amount of paper con
sumed by the weekly newspapers
is not sufficient to at this time,
materially affect the newsprint sit
uation. It is* rather unfortunate
that the knowledge obtained by the
board should be secured at the ex
pense of the country publisher, but
a little common sense should have
prompted them to the fact that the
country publisher who did not use
economical methods in the manage
ment of his business, would not be
running the business long anyway.
During the past' year the only
country publishers who have sur
vived are those who have used con
servation methods all along the line.
It takes money to be extravagant
and we do not know of any brother
pubilshers who are embarrassed by
an over-supply of shekels.
The local ministers are to be con
gratulated upon their good sense in
continuing to "keep the ban on."
In some other towns where schools
have not been opened because it was
thought best to take no chances of
prolonging the influenza epidemic,
the churches and Sunday schools
have been opened and morning and
evening services held. Iftheauth-I
orities consider it dangerous toj
open school on account of the flu, it
surely is equally dangerous to re
sume church services.
If the good roads fever were as
contagious as the flu we would all
get out with a pick and shovel in
stead of knocking around with a
hammer.
Now that William G. McAdoo has
resigned as secretary of the treasury
and it is the concensus of opinion
that he will not seek the democratic
nomination for president in 1920, he
is beginning to receive some of the
praise and expression of confidence
that were withheld from him by the
narrow partizan papers which ex-j
pected to oppose his candidacy for
president. Even the hide-bound
Spokesman-Review, which never
gave him a kind word during his
administration, states editorially
that he was without doubt one of
the greatest, if not the greatest man
who has filled that very important
office." This is following the usual,
custom of giving "epitaphy"
after one is dead instead of giving
"taffy" while one is living. Bill
Nye, the great humorist, once said:
"I would rather have flower while I
can smell 'em."—Star-Mirror.

Thanksgiving was observed with

with its retinue of followings
Myron Baack and Walter McGhee
made a hasty visit with their home

Smallpox is still prevalent about
Leland. It would seem that a
more vigilant watch would be
maintained about so malignant dis

Tact Always Wins.
Of this truth we may rest assured :
The tactful person never gets into trou
ble. She may go anywhere, mingle
with all typos of people, and then pass
onward leaving only a most favorable
impression in their minds. Therefore,
the truly practical one will gladly put
herself out a wee hit in order to retain
the good will of others. For this at
titude will not only help her immeas
urably, but will certainly make easier
and smoother the ways of all with
whom she comes in contact.
Women and Housecleaning.
When a woman returns from a
month's visit she says, "Oh, how I
dread to begin cleaning up this house."
But she doesn't. You can tell by the
glee with which she seizes the broom
and the duster and stirs up a great
cloud of dust that she its n<»v realizing
that which she has eagerly anticipated
ail tlie time she was away. There is
nothing a woman enjoys so much as
kicking up a dust. For the dust is
ture to come down again, and the
source of fun is never exhausted.—

"Bring Back My Soldier Boy to Me"
The following poem was handed
in by Mrs. Frank Palmer:
Out on the ocean,
Sailing o'er the stormy sea,
Is a sweet-faced soldier boy
Sp,very dear to me.
Gone to a foreign land
To fight for liberty;
When the cruel war is over
Bring him back to me.
Chorus.
Angels guard my soldier
Wherever he may be,
Sweet be his dreams
Upon the rolling sea.
Watch o'er him kindly,
Bring him ever peace and joy,
Guide him safely home to me
My sweet soldier boy.
For life and liberty,
The dear red, white and blue,
He left his home
And all he loved most true;
Fighting 'neath the colors
Which the foe can ne'er destroy
He the victory will win,
My pwn soldier boy.
When peace and happiness
Upon this heart shall reign,
When those who've parted
Shall meet and love again;
0, may my darling
Not be numbered with the slain—
Let me welcome to my heart
My soldier boy again.

RATIONS FOR LAYING ST CK
Pullets on Farm Should Get Large
Part of Feed by Foraging if
No Snow on Ground.
(Prepared by the United States Depart
ment of Agriculture.)
When there is no snow on the
ground pullets on the farm ought to
get a large part of their feed by for
aging. Whether they can get it de
pends not only upon what food may
be available but on whether they have
been so distributed as to get the feed
on tlie range. To find whether they
require more is to observe how far
they range and whether they find feed
enough to keep them busy most of the
time, and then to test them further
by seeing how much they eat heartily
in tlie morning, and then go foraging,
and also how much they eat just be
fore going to roost at night. Bullets
that forage well and have tlie oppor
tunity to get plenty of green food,
worms anil bugs cannot be overfed by
giving them what grain they will eat
up clean. Careful feeders learn just
how much their flock will take, and so
avoid waste while keeping the birds
full fed.
Pullets in confinement should have
the same ration they will have in tlie
winter, and be liberally supplied with
the vegetable feeds available at the
season. Liberal use of these makes it

possible to feed grains heavily, to pro
mote egg production, and yet keep the
birds in the best of physical condition.
A good war-time standard ration is:
Mash.
2 parts cornmeal
1 part bran
1 part middlings
1 part ground oats
1 part meat strap or fish meal
. Scratch Feed.
1 part cracked corn
1 part heavy oats
Green Feed.
Cabbage, sprouted oats or any avail
able green vegetable. Another good
ration with less beef scrap is as fol
lows:
Mash.
5 parts mixed feed (bran and mid
dlings)
4 parts cornmeal
1 part beef scrap or fish meal
Scratch Feed.
1 part cracked corn
Green Feed.
Cabbage, sprouted oats or any avail
aide green vegetable.
For a moist mash use eight parts of
mixed feed instead of five. Sprouted
oats are recommended as green feed,
not as preferable to cabbage and other
green vegetables when diese can be
obtained, but in order to use oats as
much as possible.
SUCCESS IN RAISING PIGEONS
Good Breeding Stock Is Essential and
It Is Best to Purchase From
Reliable Breeder.
Good breeding stock is necessary to
succeed in pigeon raising. It is advis
able to buy pigeons from reliable
breeders—those who guarantee their
stock. Many failures in squab raising
have been due to poor stock—old pig
eons past their period of usefulness,
or perhaps too many male birds. There
are a great many varieties of pigeons,
but only a few are used in squab rais
ing. The Homer is generally consid
ered tlie most popular variety.
SIX VARIETIES OF TURKEYS
Bronze, White Holland, Bourbon Red,
Black, Narragansett and Slate
Are Recognized.
The American Standard of Perfec
tion recognizes six different varieties
of domesticated turkeys ns most de
sirable, the many others being largely
mongrel, breeding from which is al
ways uncertain as to quality of the
piogeny. The standard varieties are
the Bronze, the White Holland, Bour
bon Red, the Black, the Narragansett
and the Slate.
