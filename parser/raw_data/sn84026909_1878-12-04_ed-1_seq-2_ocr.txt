Governor's Annual Message.
-7STATE OF SOUTH CAROLINA,
EXECUTIVE CHAMBER,
CoLUMBTA, November 26, 1878.
Gentlemen of the General Assembly:
The painful accident which hap
pened to Governor Hampton en Thurs
day, the 7th instant, and which sent.
deep sorrow and gloom to every house
hold in the State, having disabled
him physically from the performance of
his high duties as Governor of the
State of South Carolina, with that ex.
ated patriotism and self-sacrificing de
votion to the best interest of theState
which has characterized him through
-ife, as soon as he became aware of the
-full extent of his injuries he at once
elieved himself by proclamation of
-hthe powers and duties of said office,
and, under the provisions of the Con
stitution, the same devolved upon me
This took place on the 13th instant.
and-on-the same day I took charge
.!-tt9he Executive Department. Un'der
-these circumstances, it has become my
duty to address you at this your an
nual meeting. This unfortunate ca
Jamity to Governor Hampton was so
unexpected and the time has been so
short since I assumed the discharge
of the duties appertaining to this
o e, and the pressure of the current
business has been so heavy, that I have
been unable, up to this time, to inform
n-- yself fully of the wants and necessi
e' of our people so as to make such
l and matured recommendations
audsuggestions to your honorable
as the condition of the Statr
- -may perhaps require, and as, no doubt,
--Governor Hampton, had he been spar
sedthis misfortune, would have been
iipared to make.
7.The reports, however, of the very
efficient offi3ers in the different de
rtments and boards connected with
ti administration, which will be laid
yon your tables at an early day, are
o full ani thorough, so abundant in
fmnation and so replete wit h valu
Ab1esuggestions covering the special
ubject matters to which they sever
ly refer, and these matters embrac
Fng as they do almost the entire field
ofkgislation, I feel greatly relieved
hereby ani- shall content myself on
his occasion with calling the atten
of the General Assembly especial
F.10 -the valuable contents of these
rdports, with such recommendations
tiereon as within the limited time
rhiih.has been allowed me I have
~enenabled to conclude would be wise
~j ndproper.
- FINANCE.
'The annual report of the Comp
s ~ller General, to be submitted to
Syou with the other department re
~orts by the 1st of iDecember, will
contain an elaborate and carefully-pre
2ared statement of the errors and in
uraies in the books of his offiee
~ndof thei Treasurer's office, as turned
Soeeytothe present incumbents by their
-redecessors, and also a report upon
thie value of numerous accounts which
-camber thle books and reader decep
tve tbb balance sheet which he is by
$.-1awrequired to lay before your hon
orable bodies as exhibiting a true and
~acorate account of the actual state of
~ he Treasury. I beg to commend this
-eport to your consideration.
B esides the usual statistics relating
t~ o taxes and the financies, his report
Swllalso be found to contain some
-~getons upon these matters, and
other subjects relating to his depart
'iient, which I regard as valuable, be
K in based upon the experience and
ibservation of the last two years or a
eist careful and competent public
-ofca. - The importance of the sub
~ ecs dealt with in this report, and
the fact that any discussion of them.
-'to be of value, must go into elaborate
'S etails and statistics, induces me to
6 efrain from further allusion to them
- ,at this time, as the report. itself will
bea found to be full, clear and ac
curate.
There is one matter, however, which
~s brought out in the report to which
I esire to call your attention espec
ia4.There are some evils connected
ith the organization of what is
u2kown as the Board of Equalization
-hieh eminently deserve considera
ion. In the report of the Comip
> troller will be found suggestions in
tended to remedy these exils. It eer
~'tainly is just that every citizen in the
State should be required to aid the
~ernment in the shape of taxation
Sto the extent of the value of his prop
erty protected thereby. The burden
of taxation, however, should bear
equally on all, and it is to be hoped
that in your wisdom, some measure
maay- be adopted to improve the pres
~'ent system of assessment and be promo
tive of the great end of equality, so
mnuch to be desired. If this is done,
no eitizen would have the right to
complain, nor would they complain,
for I feel sure that all of our people
~re willing to bear their proper share
6fihe burden of necessary taxation ;
aut in the absence of this, complaints
wi not only be numerous but well
founded. The object of the Board of
"'Equalization is to produce this equal
ity, and to this end the manner in
which the Board is to be organized is
a matter of the highest importance.
EDUCATION.
The report of the State Sup3rin
tendent of Education gives an en
~couraging account of the condition of
the-public schools.
The last General Assembly made
-important changes in the school law.
wvhich is now better adapted to the
wants of our people.
The report shows 11G,239 children
attended the public schools last year,
an increase of nearly 14,000 over the
numiber reported for the preceding
year. This fact, together with the in
ereased interest in education mani
S-fested by all classes of our citizens
an h npoements in our public
sceure more prompt payment of the
teachers' salaries. During the past
year much embarrassment and loss to
teachers resulted in the delay in the
collection of taxes. Unless some
remedy for this evil is provided, it is
feared that we will lose the services of
some of our best teachers.
The other recommendations con
tained in the report are well worthy of
your careful consideration.
The last General Assembly prepar
ed a memorial to be presented to
Congress asking the restoration to the
State of the property in Charleston
known as the Citadel Academy. I
am not informed as to what actiou, if
any, was taken by Congress in this
matter. This valauble property, which
belongs to the State, has been held
since the war by the Federal govern
ment and*used as a garrison for troops.
The re establishment of the Military
Academy is a measure of -great im
portauce to our educational interests.
The early opening of the State
University is, in my judgement, of
the greatest importance. The Con
stitution of the State, Article X;
Section 9, makes it the duty of the
General Assembly to provide for the
maintenance of this institution. The
faithful discharge of the duty thus
imposed, is rendered more binding by
considerations of the highest policy.
There can be no doubt that the unity
of our people in the past and the com
manding position which for so many
years South Carolina held in the
counsels of 91e nation was due in
some measure to the influence of the
college. Nothing will contribute more
to the material prosperity of the
State than the restoration of this in
stitution to its former condition ol
usefulness.
I do not underestimate the denomi
national colleges which now exist in
this State. They are contributing
largely to the education of our peo
ple, and they-well deserve the patron
age which they receive, and more. Bui
iu order to complete our educationa
fabric, we should have a State insti
tution not only worthy of the past,
but fitted for the increased wants of th
future. This matter, however, is sole.
ly for you. You are better informed
of the wants and wishes of the peo
ple and their necessities, financial and
otherwise, than myself; and with vot
to whom this subject properly belongs
I respectfully leave it.
MILITIA.
The general condition of this branel
of the public service shows great im
provement, as will be seen from th<
full exhibit in the report of the Ad
jutant and Inspector General. Man:
nominal organizations of the Nationa
Guard, which, on inspection, had
failed to meet the requirements o
law. have been disbanded, but al
effective bodies have been retained
and the State Volunteers have rapid;
increased in numbers and efficiency
and their condition is highly credita
table to their officeers and the people
The supply of arms and equipments
however, is totally inadequate. Man~
of the commands are entirely withou
outfit of any kin's, and, though severa
artillery companies have been organ
ized, yet the State does not own a sin
gle piecc of ordnance.
The usual source from which sup
plies have been drawn is the genera
government. By Act of Congress
the sum of two hundred thousand dol
la-s is annually appropriated for arm
ine- the militia of the States, and
efforts are now being made in some o:
the Northern States to have this sua
increased to one million per annum
Under the present law, the quota foi
this State is the sum of $3,358.50
due on the 30th of June of each year
Under the proposed increase, Soutl
Carolina would be entitled to aboul
1,000 annually. Tbis sum would
be adequate to the wants of the de
partment, and would soon place it or
a first class footing.
There exists, however, serious diffi
culty in tbe way of obtaining the
rdinance stores needed from the gen
eral government. In the year 1809
Gov. R.K. Seog,being authorized t
from the United States, actually dreni
ten thousand stands of obsolete muzzk
loading muskets with equipments
The government claimed to regard thi
issue as having been drawn in advanc
of the whole quota of the years there
after, and now declines to issue an~
ordinance stores to South Carolina
Under the third section of the Act o:
March the 3d, 1875, this State ha~
also been charged' with all its quotas
during the period of the war, althougt
six years before this Act the larg
drafts above re,ferred to had been made
It is believed that Congress will re
adjust this account whenever the fact~
can be made known, and it is earnest
lv desired that the matter should be
brought to the attention of our menm
bers in Congress by such action as
your wisdom may dictate. Until this
matter is settled, the troops must re.
main unequipped to a great extent, as
the financial condition of the State al
this time will not justify the expendi
ture of the large sum necessary tc
purchase the arms and accoutrements
needed. Some legislation, however,
will be needed to perfect the system
and I respectfully recommend to youi
consideration the report of the Adju
tant and Inspector General as embody
ing the immediate wants of this de
partment.
ENAL AND) CHARITABLE INSTITU
TION.
The reports of the officers of the
pnal and charitable institutions will
give you all necessary information as
to the condition and wants of these
institutions. I have had an opportu
nity recently of visiting the Lunatic
Asyum, and I must congratulate the
State in having a Board of Regents
who are most zealously devoting much
sent in at an early period, and I invite
your careful attentiou to its contents,
and, if our burdened Treasury cau
p.siibly bear it. spare something to
th.. humane objects suggested for the
benefit of this stricket ponrtio of our
people.
COURT OF CLAINIS.
I have been informed by the lon.
J. C. Coit, Judge of the Court of
Claims, that, in the discharge of his
dutie,s, it became necessary to have
counsel to represent the State, and
that Mr. John R. Abney, Solicitor of
the Fifth Circuit. rendered profe-sio.
al service to the Court at such times
as he could spare cousistently with his
duty upon the Circuit. The Act or
ganizing this Court authorized the
Coiunssioner, in cases of doubt or.
diffliculty, to call iu the aid of the
Solicitor of the County, but no pro
vision was made for his compeiisa
tion. I respectfully recommend this
iatter to your consideration, both as
to compensation for past services and
also as to the propriety of fixing a
sum for the future if counsel should
be needed.
TIE PALMETTO 'MONUMENT.
Permit me also to call your atten
tion to the condition of the beautiful
monument which stands on the Capi
tol grounds to the famous Paluietto
Regiment of South Carolina, which,
by its gallantry on a foreign field. re
flected so much honor upon its State
during the Mexican war. Two pan
els, containing the names of many of
the officers and soldiers have been
lost. They could be restored at trifling
cost and thus the monument preserved,
as it was intended, an ever existing
memento of that gallant band of
Carolinians.
MATERIAL I)EVELOPMENT.
I hope, gentlemen, that the period
is now rapidly approaching when the
people of this State can give less time
and attention to political affairs and
devote themselves to the material
development of the State. I do not
mean to imply that they should aban
don all interest in those public mat
ters usually understood as political.
On the contrary, every good citizen
should take a deep interest in such
issues.
The character of the government
Wider which a people live exerts a
more powerful influence upon their
destiny than all other agencies com
bined, and that character almost en
tirely depends upon the character of
the governmental officials. That gov
ernment is best which is best ad
ministered, and the highest and surest
guaranty to this end is capacity and
integrity Cu the part of those to whom
Sthe different departments are en trusted.
Under our system, this depends on
the wanner in which the elective fran
chise is exercised, not by a few but by
the whole people; heuce, it follows
that every good citizen should take
active part and exert all his influence
towards the accomplishment of that
great end-good government-which
in itself is the beginning and founda
tion of all progress and prosperity.
But good government has now been
accomplished in South Caroliua. Home
rule has been rescued from the hands
of those political brigands who ma
rauded the State for so long a time,
and I hope that it has been made per
manent ; if not, it certainly can be
made so by the continued observance
of those great and wise principles of
justice and e-qual protection, to all
which has so eminently distinguished
the present administration and whieb
so fully meets the approbation of the
great heart of the people. Such be
ing the fact, it is time to begin mate
rial reuperation in earnest. After
good government, in this lies the
strength, greatness and power of a
people.
All history teaches the fact that
there are three grand departments of
human industry,-agriculture, com
merce and manufactures,-which are
the corner stones of human progress.
The temple of earthly prosperity rests
upon them, and that people is most
fortunate who have been blessed by a
kind Providence with material for
their full development. Now this is
precisely the condition of this State :
Small in extent, limited in territory,
yet it is full and abounding to a re
mnarkabl e degree with all the material
elements necessary to the development
of these main industries of life. No
part of the globe is blessed with a
more fertile soil or genial climate; no
portion of the Atlantic coast is marked
with better harbors ; nor can cheaper
roads be built elsewhere ; and where
can there be found better facilities for
the building up of all kinds of profita
ble manufactories, both great and
small, than here ? When you look at
the State and see it thus so full of
such important natural resources, it
would seem that Providence had in
tended that a great and happy people
should dwell within its borders It
should be our aim not to defeat this
beneficent end of Provideace, either
by suffering misrule on the part of the
government or by sloth and inaction
on the part of the citizens in failing to
make use of the advantages by which
they are surrounded. And I would
earnestly recommend to the General
Assembly to take this matter under
consideration and see how far legisla
tion can aid in the building up of
these industries. I have no special
scheme to rceowmen'd, but I have
thought it would not be out of place
to suggest the great ends to be ac
complishied, leaving the means to your
better judgment and superior infor
mation and wisdom.
II will, however, venture to sugg-est,
in reference to agriculture, onte mecas
ure which, in my judgment, is greatly
needed, at least in much the larger
porton of the up country. I refer to
what is usually known as the stock
mw* ~ -- i~
proves the stock, more effectuolly t
protects growing crops, brings thou I
sand of acres of good land under
cultivation, and, what is of great
importance in some sections of the I
State, would preserve the timber and
forest of the country, and it adds in
every way to the end of all investments
and labor, viz., profit. In some
Counties in the State it has been
adopted by a vote of the people, under i
a previous law enacted by the General
Assembly. With great deference I
would say that this mode of legislation
is an innovation of doubtful policy
upon the established manner of enact
ing laws; and, elections upon local
qustious generally produces discord
and strife and split communities into
parties, which has a tendency to in
volve other and perhaps more important
matters, to the general prejudice of the
country.
In this connection, let me say that
I have nuderstood that during the
past two years there have been 600
able-bodied men constantly on the list
of Penitentiary convicts, besides others
in the County jails. This is a great
mine of useful labor comparatively lost
to the State. All this labor should
be utilized in the development of our
resources. We have rivers that need
deepening, canals that ought to be
dug, mines explored, railroads built.
The beautiful stream that flows by the
capital now useless and wasted on ac
count of a few trifling obstructions
across its bed near the city, might be
made s vital artery, high above this
point, to the internal commerce of the
State: the old Santee Canal opened;
those immense phosphatic deposits
which lie imbedded in the rivers of
the lower country fully explored and
developed, and many other important
enterprises consummated by a sys
tematic employment, through a series
of years, of the labor supplied from
this source. If wen will commit
crime, what better atonement to the
public for their vicious conduct than
to be made useful in the development
of those matters in which the whole
people are interested. The forfeiture
and sequestration, so to speak, of
their labor to the public good, it
seems to me, would be a more sensible,
humane and effective punishment to
them than the immuring of their
bodies in cells and dungeons, and at
the same time would afford some com
pensation for the evils which they
have committed.
I do not know how far legislation
already had may accomplish results in
the direction indicated, but I would
recommend the whole subject to your
careful consideration.
If we intend to become a great,
strong and prosperous State, the mud
sills of our building must be made ofI
material developmen t. Comnmence with
that, and all the other elements of
srengt vesnd greatness will come of
The lien law expires by its own
limitation on the 1st of January next.
This law seems to have been well ma
tured at the last session. It protects
the interests of the landlord, opens a
wsy for the poor man who has nothing
but his health and muscles upon
which to obtain credit to make these
available, and it cheapens the arrange
ment of recording and filing, and I
think it would promote the welfare of
the people to have it re-enacted.
CONCLUSION
In conclusion, gentlemen, permit me
to congratulate the General Assembly
and the whole State upon the peace
and good order which has mark~ the
conduct of our people during the past
year, and especially during the excit
ing circumstances of the political
campaign through which we have just
passed. Since the late war we have
constantly claimed that if the State
could but be placed back under the
control of those to whom it rightfully
belonged, on account of their superior
qualifications of integrity, competeney
and interest, free from foreign inter
ference and domestic incompetency
and misrule, that the violence and
turbulence thereby engendered, and
which were fast becoming chronic
features in her history, would instantly
disappear and that peace and good
order would immediately reassert them
selves. In 1876 this revolution was
accomplished, and the late campaign
during the present administration
fully vindicates the justice and
truthfulness of our claim in that event,
and should silence forever the libels
and slanders to which the character of
the citizens of the State has been so
long, so unjustly and so shamefully
subjected. We as a people are enti
tled to rejoice at our redemption from
governmental misrule and its consL
quences, and I feel sure that good men
everywhere, when they come to under
stand the situation, will join with us
in our rejoicing, and will sympathize
with us in our struggle for the per
manency of that redemption. Let
me express the hope that nothing will
occur in the future to ma~r this recordi
and that our people throughout the|
State will unite together 'n the pre
servation of the public peace and the
continued supremacy of the law.
I have purposely refrained from
discussing any matters connected with
the Federal government, for several
reasons ; among the most prominent is
the fact that, while the State and
Federal governments are closely con.
nected with each other, and while the
happiness of the people of this State
is much dependent upon both, yet the
orbits of these two governments are
entirely separate and distinct, anid the
harmony of their movements can be
best preserved by each confining itself
to the discharge of its own functious1
as diined and limited in the Constitu
tions of this State and of the United
States.
This was certainly the intention of
the founders of our system, and could
~ l-.,~ ~ ii-~rriPrl rnit~ hnrrt~ r:iJ~ I
>right future to the people of this
state.
In closing this communication, per.
nit me, gentlemen, to invoke the
>essings of Almighty God upon your
ieliberativis. May He give you wis
tAom from on high, and may the per
orance of your arduous and respon
iii- : duties be marked with that har
n.1y which so eminently distinguished
,he General Assemblies of the olden
past in South Carolina, reflecting
[onor upon yourselves and lasting 1
biefits upon your people and State.

vantages. For Terms, see first page.
Patterson's Successor. Iho
Shall He Be?
The two names most prominent
before. the Legislature as candid
ates for the United States Senator
ship are those of Gov. Hampton
and Gen. Gary. We have nothing
to say against Gen. Gary; indeed
we admire his brilliant war record,
and appreciate at their true
value the great services he has ren
dered the party and the State in
the more recent past. But it is no
derogation to him to say that he
would stand no chance in a free and
untrammeled race with Gov. Hamp
ton-no man would. Hampton is
beyond comparison; he towers far
above every other man in the State
in the love and admiration of the
people. In this matter of the Sen
atorship, however, efforts are being
made, not by Gen. Gary, but by
some of his frie-ids, to trammel
Gov. Hampton with side issues.
They maintain that he is impera
tively needed at home. They even
go further than that, and say that
his acceptance of the Senatorship,
thereby resigning the Executive
oficee, would be to desert his pott;
to use his present position as a
stepping-stone-that he can accom
plish more good as Governor than
any other man can, and that he has
been elected on that account. That
hc is the most suitable man for
Governor ; but, at the same time,
insist that he is also and in a high
er degree the most suitable man
for Senator. The State is safe now.
With every County but one in the
State democratic ; with peace and
tranquility pervading every section,
what is there to fear ? Whatever
else remains to be done in the mat
ter of reform and retrenchment
must be done by the General As
sembly. The democratic party is
safe in power in this State. We
need now to turn our attention to
national politics. It is in the na
tional councils that the highest tal
ents and the broadest statesman
ship are needed. No man can more
fitly nor more ably represent South
Carolina and the whole South there
than Wade Hampton. The people
want to see him there, both for his
own sake and their own. Having
borne the heavy burdens and the
light compensation of the Guberna
torial office one term, having so .pa
triotically and so nobly borne great
sacrifices for them, they desire to
see the State recompense him by
bestowing upon him the highest
honor within its gift. To this feel
ing of gratitude there is added the
almost universal conviction that
Hampton is the man for the place ;
that, as Gen. Conner says, the best
interests of the State require the
presence of Gov. Hampton in thie
United States Senate.
Gov. Hampton's condition.
Friday there was a change fQr the
worse in Gov. Hampton's condition.
Dr. Kinlock, of Charleston, and Dr.
Campbell, of Augusta, were tele
graphed for, and came. After con
ultation with the other physicians
in attendance they concluded that
imputation is not now necessary
and express the hope of saving his
Leg and of his ultimate recovery.
The Legislature starts off well.
With earnest work and not too
uch oratorical spouting they can
soon wind up all the business before
bem. If they make the session

VEGE TINE
Will Cure Rheumatism.
MR. ALBERT CROOKER* the well-known
druggist and apothecary, of Springvale, Me.,
always advises every one troubled with Rheu
matism to try VEGETINE.
Read His Statement:
SPRINGVALE, ME., Oct. 12,1878.
MR. H. R. STEVENS:
Dear Sir-Fifteen years ago last fall I was
taken sick with rheumatism, was unable to
move until the next April. From that time
until three years ago this fall I suffered ev
erything with Rheumatism. Sometimes
there would be weeks at a time that I could
not step one step; these attacks were quite
often. I suffered everything that a man
could. Over three years ago last spring I
cmmenced taking VEGETINE and followed
It up until I had taken seven botles; bave
had no rheumatism since that time. 1 al
ways advise every one that is troubled with
rheumatism to try VEGETINE, and not suffer
for years as I hav,e done. This statement is
gratuitous as far as Mr. Stevens is concerned.

VEGETINE
Has Entirely Cured Me.
BOSTON, Oct., 1870.
ME. H. R. STETENS:
Dear Sir-My daughter, after having a se
vere attack of Whooping Cough, was left in
a feebie state of healtb. Being advised by a
friend she tried the VEGETINE, and after
using a few bottles was fully restored to
health.
I have been a great sufferer from Rheuma
tism. I have taken several bottles of the
VEGETINE for this complaint, and am happy
to say it has entirely cured me. I have re
commended the VEGETINE to others with
the same good results. It is a great cleanser
aud purifier of the blood; it is pleasant to
take and I can cheerfully recommend it.
JAMES MORSE, 364 Athens Street.
Rheumatism is a Disease of
the Blood.
The blood in this disease, is found to con
tain an excess of fibrin. VEGETINE acts by
converting the blood from its diseased condi
tion to a healthy circulation. VEGETINE
regulates the bowels which is very important
in this complaint. One bottle of Vegetine
will give relief; but, to effect a permanent
cure, it must be taken regularly, and may
take several bottles, especially in cases of
long standing. VEGETINE is sold by all
Druggists. Try it, and your verdict will be
the same as that of thousands before you,
who say, "I never found so much relief as
from the use of VEGE INE," which is com
posed exclusively of Barks, Roots and Herbs.
"VEGETINE," says a Boston physician,
"has no equal as a blood purifier. Hearing
of its many wonderful cures, after all other
remedies had failed, I tested the laboratory
and convinced myself of its genuine merit.
It is prepared from barks, roots and herbs,
each of which is highly effective, and they
are compounded in such a manner as to pro
duce astonishing results."
VEGE TINE
Nothing Equal to It.
SOUTH SALEM, MASS., Nov. 14, 1876.
ME. H. R. STEVNs:
Dear Sir-I have been troubled with Scro
fula, Canker and Liver Complaint for three
years. Nothing ever did me any good until
I commenced using the VEGETINE. I am
now getting along first-rate, and still using
the VEGETINE. I consider there is nothing
equa! to it for such complaints. Can hearti
ly recommend it to everybody.
Yours truly,

By What Authority?
We would like to know by what
varrant of law County Commission
1rs have feed lawyers out of the
3ublic treasurv to advise them con
-erning their duty. If this thing
s to be continued there are many
,itizens who desire to see the au
hority for it. If County Commis
3ioners cannot discharge their du
ies without legal advice let them
3ither resign the office to those who
,an or pay for such advice out of
bheir own pockets.
They have just as much right to
pay a merchant, or a farmer, or a
loctor, for advice with the public
money as to pay a lawyer.
Gen. James Conner, of Charles
Lon, who was nominated by the
Greenville Enterprise and Moun
aineer for the U. S. Senate, writes
to that paper declining the nomina
tion, and strongly urges the elec
tion of -Gov. Hampton. He says
that it is his settled conviction that
the best interests of the State re
quire the presence in the Senate of
Governor Hampton.
The Supreme Court of the State
has decided that Probate Courts
have no jurisdiction in cases of par
tition of real estate; and therefore
all acts done by Probate Judgvs in
such cases and all sales of real es
tate made by them for partition
are void.
Of the 124 members of the pres
ent House of Representatives 89 are
new men. We hope the improve
ment on the last Hoase will be in
the same proportion.
Only seven colored men in the
Legislature-four Democrats and
three Republicans.
Something for the New YeAr.
The world renowned success of Hostetter's
Bitters and their continued popularity for a
quarter of a century as a stomachic, is scarcely
more wonderful than the welcome that greets
the annual appearance of Hostetter's Alma
nac. This valuable medical treatise is pub
lished by Hostetter & Smith, Pittsburgh, Pa.,
under their own immediate supervision, em
ploying 80 hands in that department. Ten
cylinder printing presses, 8 folding machines,
5 job presses, &c., are running about eleven
months in the year on this work, and the is
sue of same for 1879 will not be less than ten
millions, printed in the English, German,
French, Welsh! Norwegian, Swedish, Hol
land, Bohemian and Spanish languages.
Refer to a copy of it for valuable and inter
esting reading concerning health, and nume
rous testimonials as to the efficacy of Bostet
ter's Bitters, amusement, varied information,
astronomical calculations and chronological
items, &c., which can be depended on for cor
rectness. The Almanac for 1879 can be ob
tained free of cost, from druggists and general
country dealers in all parts of the country.

Irinking vinegar to reduce their forms
