JUDGE WOODRUFF.

comes as u complete surprise. Such
a struggle was undo to secure Mr.
Woodruffs appointment that his
tarly letlreiuent mli;ht well cause

It was km soon dune for."
During his short career In this

favorable Impression. Ho hns not

KAPAA'S LATEST LAND SALE.
According to the (linden Isliind.
the land bale of the Kapaa lots was
thniuughl) advertised.
Ever) body hopes so
Some time ago the public was re
galed with a dissertation said to
come from the Land Commissioner
that Hawall'ij uvailablo public lands
were not only to be advertised
throughout this Tenltory,- but on
tho mainland as well, so that all
people might Know of the offerings
lor homestead u theso Islands.
Very soon after the Kapaa land
Bale took place.
This was particularly a sale in
which tho small homesteader Bhould
bo Interested. This splendid oppor
tunity was published to the world
through the medium of Kauai Coun
ty's wieeMy paper, utid possibly
posters.
If that Is to bo the advertising
campaign of the public lands depart
ment, If that is to be tho method by
v which the world 'is to know that a
veritable gat den on Kauai is await
ing someone's developing hand, tho
tlmo will bo far distant when tho
gulden will bloom with anj thing
hut lantaiiu.
Judged from appearances, the
method followed in handling tho
Kapaa land business Is the shortest
route for disci editing liomesteadlng
k una losioring u recuirenco to the old
' Idea that nothing but big capital
and set lie labor can ovci devolop
anything in the Tenltory of Hit-wall.

Hut what can honest men si) ot

besmirch tho character of one of the

And what can honest men say ot
the police chief who, after the caBO
ag itust one of his ofllccrs has been
proved to be without foundation, re
fuses to cornet tho error by accept
ing the letommcudatlon nf the

of raising tho mural standard ot tho

THE MESSAGE.
President Taft appears, to hao
made no sensational declarations in
his first luessage to Congress deal
ing with the geneint administration
of the government.
He has been standing pat on the
tatllT ever since It was patched up
by the special session of Congress.
The people will ogrce with him
that further revision Is not advis
able Immediately following the
worry of attempting to rovlso It
dovvnwatd. Hut It Is not probable
they will agree with him that tho
ptesent tnrlff situation Is wholly bet
Isfactory. Ills attitude on the postal savings
bank has been made known thiougli
his public uddresses, and vigorous
prosecution of those engaged In tho
"white slave" tiade Is to bo ex
pected. President Taft apparently Is to
make his record for the Immediate
present on the Nlcarnguun question,
and his policy gives promlso of be
ing firm to tho point of aggressive
ness. At leaBt one CentiuM Ameri
can country wllf be taught that it
cannot kill off citizens of tho Unltou
States without giving them n fair
hearing unless It pa)s dearly for tho
violation of ull the laws of decent
civilization. V

Can Grow The Tree
With Profit In
Hawaii
I'orcstry experts In theso Islands
have admitted that thu growing or
(ileal) plus treis hero for purel) lo
cal' consumption, such us: llrevvood,
posts and poles, will pa) thoso hav
ing suitable lands. Where llicto
exists largo tracts of level land and
where tho Mill Is deep and wliete
thete Is a continuous natural sub-
irrlgatiun, eucnl)ptus trees should
do well In theso Islands.
Contrary to tho popular supposi
tion, these trees require enormous
quantities of water, If what Callfor-
nlans term a "maximum growth" Is
to bo secured. Years ago, cucul)ptus
trees were planted on tho Pall and
other parts of the Island, but their
giuwth has been slow.
Some icmarkahlc tests have been
made with eucal)ptus which have
proven some ot tho species to be tho
strongest woods In tho world. Tho
strength of tho weakest of tho West
Australian eucaljpttiR has been
proven by tho government tests to bo
equal to that of hickory and 20 per
cent greater than that ot tho best
oak. Piles driven In seaside wharves
have, utter sevent) years' service,
been withdrawn and found to be
perfectly sound. Telegraph and tele
phone poles tested after twenty
)ears service gavo results only S
per cent below' the averugo ot un
used seasoned Umbels.
Experiment has plovcn that It Is
necessary to plant eucalyptus In
lands which abound In humus, or
whero rank herbaceous weeds pre
dominate. All theso featuies are
lound right here in Oaliu and neigh
boring Islands, so that there Is room
for piofltable Investment If capital

FAVORS COTTON CROP

) from w Inds li a i idgo which runs
through tho center ot tho Island.
All structures will have to bo
built from timber brought from the

suppl) Is Inadequate for that pur

tract chosen for cotton growing is
tfree from nil liiogtilarltlcs, Dr.
Wilcox considers this lo bo tho finest
trait of land for dr) -farming that
i ho has seen In the Teirltory of Ha

Since tho completion of the sale

has lecelved several letters from
seed dealers on the mainland, offei
Ing special rates on Sea Island seed.
Hut as the local Sea Island seed Is ot
a superior quality ami Is moro
adaptable to climatic conditions', It
Is not likely that seed will be
