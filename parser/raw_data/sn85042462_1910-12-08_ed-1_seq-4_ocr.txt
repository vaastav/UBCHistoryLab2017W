FATALITIES OF THE GRIDIRON
NO less than nineteen killed and more than 420
players injured is the record of the "revised"'
game of football for the season just closed,
yet large as this gory showing is (he deaths fall
just four short of the list lot the previous year. As
compiled from the news dispatches the list of killed
and wounded is as follows:
Deaths duo to football 19
Acciiicnts tit first regarded as critical 17
Concussion of brain •••• 32

Broken jaws 3
Broken cheek bones 2
Dislocations M
Gashes 43
Torn ligaments 32
Teeth knocked out 9
Total of all accidents, not including deaths..429
One of the excuses oftenest heard for the east
ern game is that its victims are for the most part
from the soft, untrained players; that the trained
college athletes rarely are seriously hurt. But
that excuse is made grimly ridiculous this year by
the fact that of the dead live were from the ranks
of the college players and twenty-four of these
were seriously hurt.
Two things have been made apparent by the
"open" game of the past two seasons. One is that
the opening of the game has made it rougher and
more deadly than ever because of its collisions;
the other is that the rules makers revise the rules
with their tongues in their cheeks —they want to
keep the sport interesting and care mighty little
for a few fatalities more or less either way.
TAFT IS NO LEADER
PRESIDENT TAFT'S message to congress
reveals liim as the same timid character who
has forfeited the confidence of the masses
who want reforms and want them forthwith. Not
so much by what lie says as by his manner and
what he does not say is this timidity made appar
ent. Jn every step lie takes he is the cautious, con
servative we have learned to know who thinks
something ought to be done, perhaps, but that we
shouldn't be rash about it.
A great moral question overshadows all other
matters of politics and statesmanship, but there is
not a word in Tuesday's message about it. The
question is the deadly clutch that incorporated
money has gained over legislation and adminis
tration, and even over some of our courts. Spe
cial privilege isn't killed, it's only scotched a little.
Least of all men the president should be fooled
by thinking any real progress has been made to
ward the dethronement of money.
And yet to read Mr. Taft's complacent message
one would suppose there was no great moral issue,
of vital importance to capital and labor, to rich
and poor, to city and farms, to west and east. The
president will be satisfied if things as they arc can
move along in their accustomed way, if congress
will kindly refrain from disturbing "confidence"
by doing anything rash. That is the tenor of the
whole massage. When he docs make a positive
declaration you feel somehow that it is not born of
the kind of conviction that would fight for its be
lief.
If somebody should ask us to put a linger on
any spot in the message that is very timid we say
frankly it would not be easy to comply; vet that
spirit is there in a hundred places. It is there in
the general note <>i caution; the concern for busi
ness confidence, which phrase is Wall street's old
soporific; in the evident desire to conform to. a
program thai his old conservative friends can sup
port, as well as the insurgents.
Mr. Taft has not read his lesson of November
8 well. Tie is still listening to those who hack ship
subsidies; those who don't want much parcel! posi
extension until we "can afford it"; those who want
tariff corrections delayed until a commission can
come into existence and get to work, and God
knows when that will be; those who want more
warships and fortifications for the profit there is in
the business of war; those who want a bureau of
health to bring about a medical trust.
Mr. Taft's millionaire brother and rill his club
friends will approve the message as a safe and sane
document. They think it is radical enough to suit
reasonable progressives (they have reached a
frame of mind that admits some progressives can
be reasonable), and it will not wake up any dogs
of war. jt is the impression his acts create in the
fashionable clubs that .Mr. Taft appears to con
sider. There, he feels, the "solid" elements of
American business life gather and discuss in pad-
Jed leather chairs over their Scotch-and-soda the
welfare of "business."
The pathetic thing is that while Mr. Taft has
lost the confidence of the masses he has not gained
in its place the support of the element, he has
sought to placate. The substance he had when
he was elected--lhe confidence of the entire coun
try —he has dropped, like the dog in the fable, for
the shadow of support from that element Aldrich
md Sherman typify.
D-y-ur C-r-s-m-s sh-p-i-g e-r-l-y. A reward
for solving this riddle is offered by every store.

BALLINGER'S NEW WHITE SUIT
HELD back until after election in evident fear
of stirring up the subject, the report of the
majority of what is known as the Ballinger
committee is now received with more indifference
and contempt than ever, with the new stamp of
partisanishp the delay has given it. In the fact
that the expected whitewash was prepared for the
secretary, people will only find confirmation <>f
their other conclusion that he needed it.
Mr. Bellinger's association with special inter
ests and friendship for Alaska claimants; his ef
fort to hasten the patenting of the Cunningham
claims; his avowal when he took office that he
would make the Roosevelt-Pinchot-Garfield con
servation plan look like 30 cents, or words to that
! effect; his previous service as legal adviser to the
I Alaskan coal claimants between his incumbency
as land commissioner and secretary of the interior
—these things settled the matter with the jury of
the people long ago.
The average American citizen doesn't want to
do Mr. Ballinger any injustice. lie has become
convinced of the secretary's unntness largely on
the above evidence but partly on the moral instinct
which is often as sure and safe a guide as the
reasoning power. That moral intuition tells the
average citizen that while Mr. Ballinger may not
have done anything actually illegal he has shown
that in a crisis which meant everything to con
servation and to the future relation between spe
cial interests and the government, Mr. Ballinger
was not the man the country needed at his post.
The secretary has repeatedly said he would not
quit under fire. lie has now what presumably he
regards as a vindication. This will be a good time
to retire, although by so doing he will not undo
the harm he has done to the president's political
fortunes. But before he goes we should like to
know if Mr. Ballinger was appointed at the request
of Senator Guggenheim, ami if it really was done
in payment of a fat contribution from the smelter
trust to the Taft campaign war chest, presided
over by Frank Hitchcock.
There has been a rumor in Washington that
Mr. Taft didn't dare fire Ballinger. Now, if the
Nelson committee had probed that matter its re
port would have been really interesting.
FRAUDS ON THE PENSION ROLL
NO more important series of articles has ap
peared in any American publications in the
past year than that by William Bayard Hale
in The World's Work for October, November and
December, showing up the fraud with which the
federal pension roll has become honeycombed.
The magazine disclaims any intention to question
the standing and the right to his country's grati
tude and help of any veteran who is honorably and
honestly on the roll, and this is the attitude of all
patriotic persons.
At one time all veterans looked upon efforts to
purge the pension list of its scalawags with suspi
cion, as coming from enemies of the system.
Grover Cleveland's honest attempt in this direc
tion was so regarded and it failed. But there is
now no danger of any deserving soldier losing
what is rightfully his, and the time has come to
dean up the pension list, which, although a ma
jority of the war veterans and their widows are
dead, has grown from $15,000,000 at the close of
the rebellion to $155,000,000 at present.
In his investigations Mr. Hale came across:
Cases where two and even three persons had
drawn pensions for one man's service;
Cases where pensions have been continued long
after the proper beneficiaries were dead;
Cases where one man has drawn several pen
sions;
.Many cases where deserters are receiving pay
equal to that of men who served to the end;
Cases where ''bounty-jumpers" had been given
double pensions;
Cases where men absolutely without military
records have been given an enlistment and hon
orable discharge;
Innumerable cases where soldiers are being
given compensation for its utterly unconnected
with army service;
Cases where women never married to soldiers
are pensioned as legal widows;
Cases where girls born long after the war. who
had maried veterans for the sake of their pensions,
arc being paid by the nation.
The pension list ought to be a roll of honor.
\"o one has a greater interest in having it cleaned
of its mi worthies than the honorable soldier, for
the continuation and extension of a system of
plunder in his name drags him down toward the
level of those who are grafting on the federal treas
ury.
The recent encampment of the Grand Army at
Atlantic City gave the country a noble example of
self-abnegation in declining to request congress to
give a pension of a dollar a day to all veterans.
There an' comparatively few left and many of
them sorely need it. The encampment would have
done a better thing if it had insisted on a reform
of the entire system and a weeding out of the
leeches who arc now profiting by the thousand as
a result of the reign of dishonest politics for a gen
eration past.
Mrs. 'Russell Sago is going to found a "model
city" <>n Long Island. There ought to be room
for two such institutions in this country —one on
each coast. Modesty forbids our mention of the
name of the Pacific model city.
The Chicago chief of police was made play
censor and began work by suppressing Mary
Garden's "Salome." We interpret his comments
to mean thai Mary is a vulgarian of the common
or garden variety.
In Providence, R. T., a lunatic filled his coat
full of tacks with the points sticking out and
mangled a cop who arrested him. This is a form
of tacksation just a bit more loony than the poll
tax.

that he will devote his fortune to assisting the

MRS. EDDY ANALYZED
Editor Herald: The death of Mrs.
Eddy removes from the activities of
social and theological life a figure of
some note and importance and loaves
several natural questions which her
apostles will be called upon to answer,
and that speedily. These questions
were not imperative while the woman
lived, for it is a queer fact that the
personality of a man or woman of a
certain sort acts as a kind of screen
between him and his life work, casting
a glamor over that work, rendering it
Ir. a measure sacred from the profaning
touch of the investigator. I am not
explaining this fact, only stating that
it exists.
Mrs. Eddy henceforth is but a mem
ory. The first question that demands
answer is. What did this woman dis
cover to the race that was new? What
rule of life did she lay down that had
not been known from the beginning?
What way of physical or moral healing
did she give the world that wa3 not as
eld as sin and salvation?
Second: What answer did .she give
to the thinking world, sick to death
of the monkeries of theology, the wor
ship of authorities, the substitutions
of beliefs for truth?
Third: How was it possible for a
woman, born to poverty, her mature
life given to the study of metaphysics
and not to money making (see her
biographers), to accumulate J^,000,000?

PROPHECIES OF TODAY'S UNREST
Kditor Horald: Your leader in a re
cent issue, "A World-Wide Movement,"
deserves more than passing Interest. As
I read it the uterances of the prophets
Hashed before my mental vision, and
harmonised with the points of thought
set forth in your article.
This world-wide movement is tiio
''desire of all nations." -History has no
parallel to it," and "there shall be a
time of trouble such as never was
since there was a nation even to that
same time" (our time), Dan. 12:1.
"And upon the earth dlstresi of na
tions, with "perplexity" (Christ), LuKe
21:25.
"It's causes are plain—the economic
pressure." -'What mean ye that ye
grind the faces of the poor?" "Behold
the hire of the laborers . . . which
is of you kept bark by fraud, crieth.
And the cries have entered into the
ears of the Lord of Sabaoth." For ex
ample: "The gorged treasuries of the
Wclls-Fargo company paid 18 per cent
dividends, and then distributed among
its stockholders twelve million dollars
of accumulated surplus." (Vide Her
ald's late editorial, "Bowing Dragons'
Teeth.")
"The diffusion of Intelligence." "Many
shall run to and fro, seeking rest and
finding none, and knowledge shall be
increased."
Now a word as to tin- last sentence
in your awakening editorial: "Its por
tent is not so clear to forecast, but It is
big in possibilities." He assured that
the world is not running at random.
The writer could cite a thousand
things to show that God has arisen to
Judgment, is now preparing his throne
to that end. The possibilities are in
deed largo. For as tho prophet de
clares, "The Lord shall rise up as in
Mount Perazim . . . that he may
do his work, his strange work, and
bring to pass his act, his s"trange act."
To a profound student of the proph
ets, when conjoined with an earnest
belief in the ultimate fulfillment of
their visions, the portent of this world
wide movement becomes dear, and the
few years coming Will enlarge the vis
ion. " MONiiTA

IRISH UNFIT TO RULE, HE SAYS
Editor Herald: Replying to Sam
uel Abernathy's letter in The Herald
of November 30 In reference to Lord
Larebarn's utterance in parliament,
I am of the opinion that he was
dreaming when he uttered those
words refered to. I believe the peo
ple of these United States, excepting
the Irish, are wholly indifferent wheth
er Ireland gets home rule or not. I
sincerely hope they would. Give the
Irish their freedom and in 30 years
they will exterminate themselves.

SIGNAL HILL
Editor Herald: A movement to se
cure a state university in Southern
California is being pushed and Signal
hill, near Long Beach, is thought to
be a desirable place for such an in
stitution. Beautiful indeed is Signal
hill for situation. No one who has
not resided there can form any ade
quate idea of the beauty of the land
scape from the summit of the hill.
The writer can speak from experi
ence, having graded, planted and
cared for the grounds surrounding the
fine residence on the summit for eight
months. The view Is always beauti
ful, yet ever changing. At times San
Pedro, Huntington Beach and other
beaches seem so near that one can
almost see the people; at other times
the view is reversed. But the pano
rama of ocean, plain and mountain ia
grand at all times. Indeed, at night
the myriad electric lights of fourteen
cities »nliven the scene, making it
intensely interesting to one who tries
to locate each by name, including the
"village" of Los Angeles, presided
over by "Our Uncle Alec."
There is only one drawback at pres
ent to Signal hill—that is its compara
tive isolation. If the place is chosen
for the state university there will cer
tainly be a car line to or near the
summit, and then 1 predict it will be
one of the finest residence districts in
the county of Lou Angeles, it being
beautiful for situation.

ON VACCINATION
Kditor Herald: The following facts
on compulsory vaccination, Which are
from a writer In the Woman's Daily,
are worth reproduction:
"The writer hereof, alter having met
up with vaccination and smallpox in
all conditions during the last forty
years, making a close study of the dis
ease, together with its history and the
history of vaccination, fully agrees
with the conclusion of Alfred Kussel
Wallace, as testified to by him before
the British royal commission (to which
report was given the support of Profs.
Tyndal and Huxley, Drs. Creighton and
Crookshank, all former advocates of
vaccination) that 'Vaccinated persons
take smallpox more readily than if un
vacclnated.' This is contrary to the
views circulated by the medical profes
sion, but is in accordance with the
facts as developed by the investigations
of the Rritlsh royal commission, which
was appointed at the request of, mid
in the interest of the medical profes
sion in England and Wales, and was
composed entirely of men friendly to
the theory of vaccination, that, 'fol
lowing the periods of time when the
greatest number of vaccinations were
had, there were the most widely spread
and fatal epidemics of smallpox.' Sir
John Simon testified before the royal
commission that. 'of. 63,579 smallpox
hospital cases, 41,061 had been vaccin
ated. In the Highgate umallpox hos
pital over 00 per cent of the smallpox
were of people who had been vac
cinated. Physicians acknowledged be
fore the royal commission that they
had concealed facts in order to save
vaccination from reproach. Physidani
also acknowledged that erysipelas and
a long train of other diseases followed
vaccination, in many of the eases re
sulting in death. Vaccination has been
well called ii'e 'great delusion.'"

SUFFRAGETTE CAN SEE
VICTORY IN CALIFORNIA
Mrs. Shelly Tolhurst Amused by
Ballinger's Comment on
Result in Washington
When the news that Washington had
granted the franchise to women was
carried to Rtchnnl A. Halllnger, secre
tary of the interior, he Is reported to
bay« laid: "Yes, I am ashamed to say
that Washington did grant women the
right to vote. If I had been there 1
would have voted against it. We havo
then voting In school elections now."
Mrs. Shelley Tolhurst, vice president
of the Political Equality league re
ceived, this speech at the league office
in the Story building with gratification.
She laughed merrily U she considered
the disappointment which this man has
suffered at the hands of his consti
tuents, and said: "Ha! 11a! So Bal-
linger Is ashamed is he? That haughty
crest which he has never bowed is now
humbled to the dust because, forsooth,
the women of his state mny vote! Well
I am glad he said that. lam glad that
he is our enemy, because those interest!
which he represents are opposed to
woman .suffrage, and we know It."
Speaking further of the success In
Washington, Mrs. Tolhurst said:
"We cannot understand yet why the
amendment carried in Washington and
was lost.in Oregon. It must be that
It was through the same awakening
forces which swept over our own stale
and placed th,e insurgent Hopublicans
so eminently in the majority. Realiz
ing that the spirit of true democracy
is to prevail, men and women, too, will
find hope in the situation and will unite
to Improve It.
"The direct primary has helped In
this and the delegation which Southern
California Is to send to the legislature
this year is one of which we may well
be proud.
BELIEVES IN TEOPLE
"It shows conclusively that when the
people have an understanding of their
privileges and a chance to express
them they may be depended upon to do
the right thing. It is the packed con
ventions which have caused the elec
tion of men less keen, but we know
that this year we are sending a re
markable body of men to represent the
interests of this part of the state."
"Some of the opposition to the cause
is reminiscent of a faint, far voice from
the past," continued the speaker, "and
a remark by Senator Hurd repeated to
me recently was to the effect that
women were now upon pinnacles and
that giving them the ballot would pull
them down to a position of equality
with men. When I heard that I
laughed. Pinnacle! Where is that pin
nacle? Ask the shop girls, the wait
resses in restaurants, the underpaid
and overworked school teachers. How
much of a pinnacle do they occupy I
wonder?
"The shirt waist strikers and all the
other ten million working women in the
United States would like to get on that
pinnacle, and yet we are told solemnly
and with much force that to vote for
the tax collector, or to express a
preference about the tariff on sugar
will knock us all oft."
This proved a most amusing idea to
Mrs. Tolhurst, and she told a number
of pertinent stories relative to the situ
ation among the men and women she
knows.
SAYS GRAFT OPPOSES TIIKM
"We feel that we would rather be
knocked off the iiinnacle we now oc
cupy than be kept there by force by the
political enemies of woman suffrage,"
said Mrs. Tolhurst when her laugh was
over, "for what woman wants to be
kept in euch an elevated position by
the allied powers of Kraft, DOOM and
protected vice," and the speaker's eyes
Hashed with spirit, where a moment
ago they had sparkled with laughter
and merriment.
"The vicious elements massed against
the movement have great NMUTOM at
their command, money, organisation
and experience. They are professionals
at the political game, and we are only
amateurs. What wonder then that they
have ho frequently won out?"
"How definite has the opposition be
come in this state'"' was the queatlon
put to Mrs. Tolhurst, ami .she replied:
"The strongest protected forces which
were used so effectively in Oregon and
tried in vain in Washington have nut
yet been Introduced here, and our pres
ent oposition is generally that less
tangible, but not lena effectual one of
Indifference. This we meet among
persons who are not political enemies
of the cause, but theoretical opponents
who do not yet realize that according
to the democratic idea upon which our
government is founded suffrage for
women is as logical and Inevitable as
for men, and that to dispute it now
would be like trying to disprove the
theory of evolution or maintaining the
divine right of kings.
"Volumes could be written upon this,
but what's the use?" said this busy
woinaiw turning again to her desk,
where countless matters relative to her
duties in the league demanded her at
tention.

LOS ANGELES AS A
MANUFACTURING CITY
Editor Herald: Naturally and prop r
ly the larger ambition and effort of tho
people of this city is for the present to
promote the growth of commerce by
creating the neees-ary facllltiei for
what is likely to be its future needs.
The time is near when there will be re
quired enlarged Industrial development
to supply the demands of that com
merce, for they are destined to be very
great, which Is apparent when we con
sider the vast territory inland to be sup
plied from this city and the geognip 'i
cal position and other advantages
which this city possesses for extending
jits trade to foreign countries in thn
I western hemisphere, in Oceanica and
on the other side of the globe.
These supplies are not to be agricul
tural in largest part, but from the pro
| ducts of local manufacturing indus
tries. The demand for them in domes
tic and foreign trade will very noon bo
pressing. It is highly Important that
this prospect should be Impressed upon
the minds of the people, that they mny
plan and perfect enterprises that will
! meet the requirements of the lmme-
I diate future.
In saying this It is not intended to
insinuate that there is sluggishness in
industrial enterprises, for really there
is no small dogree of activity in that
field. There is already much manufac
turing in this city, but it seems to mo
that there are three branches or kinds
of manufacturing that have been ne-
Blccted, and which promise rich results
if they are undertaken with the spirit
which generally characterizes our peo
ple. They are tho manufacture of
woolen and cotton goods, tho tanning
of hides and tho manufacture of the
latter into boots and shoes and other
fabrics.
Southern California produces con
siderable wool, and adjacent Arizona
and not distant New Mexico can supply
what will be required for very large
woolen manufacturing plants. Some
cotton is already produced in the Im
perial valley and whether it shall grow
to large or considerable dimensions will
make no very material difference, for
manufacturers! hero can procure the
raw material at less cost than any man
ufacturers elsewhere in the nation ex
cept in the cotton producing Heetions.
There will be no want for hides for
tanning, as in Southern California a
largo number of beeves arc daily
slaughtered, probably running into the
hundreds. It is folly to send tho hides
away to he tanned and then brought
back at great cost in the form of
leather or leather products. It must be
apparent to those who have taken the
trouble to investigate, that few if any
sections are more favorably situated
than this city in ability to acquire tho
raw mate rials for tho industries named.
Wages and the cost of living are net
appreciably higher here than elsewhere.
A furfher and certain prospect is that
there, will be ample, markets for all
the fabrics .such industries can make.
They arc staple commodities in all tin
vast range, of territories easily and
cheaply accessible from Los Angeles.
An additional and great advantage
should be taken into consideration, and
it is that within the next eighteen
months in all probability tho simplest
ami cheapest power will be furnlshe'l
tor all manufacturing otherwise prac
ticable here. It would lie wise to make
preparations to employ that power as
soon as it is deliverer!.
