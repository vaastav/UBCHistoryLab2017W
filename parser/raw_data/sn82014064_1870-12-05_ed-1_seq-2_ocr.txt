MOXDAY. DECEMBER 5, ISTO.’J
THE ISSUE OF THE, FUTURE:
Id tbe antagonism of parties there is
always a variety of questions upon which
there are divisions of opinion, and upon
these minor points it is rarely that either
party ran command n united front. But
it is essential to all parties claiming to be
national in their aims,' their policy, and
their letlucnce, that upon the leading qnes-
lion of the day there shall be that union
which Is essential to strength and perma-
neucy. Korean parties ever maintain an
ascendancy while holding to a merely nega
tive policy. To l>e successful they must
assort something affirmative, and resolute
ly and persistently sustain it. On
that leading question, there can
l>e no equivocation or prevarication.
This was demonstrated in the case of Af-
ru*nn slavery. Tbpugb the sentiment of
an overwhelming majority of the American
jK-opb* bill been, for forty years, opposed
t<> slavery, it was not until the Republican
party bid been organized upon an nnmis
takaldv ant i*shivery platform, and bad as-
snmed that oggresssve attitude which
promised to place the institution “in the
courbu of ultimate extinction,” that tbe
anti-slavery feeling of the people could be
concentrated and made potent. Thence
forward, Its progress was irresistible. The
question of slavery bad been kept in tbe
background, but it at l«st forced itself to
the front, and parties had to take aides up
on it. or perish.
Tbe affirmative position assumed by the
Republican party in reference to slavery
baa resulted, at the end of ten years of
eventful and expensive struggle, in the
complete overthrow and extinction of that
infamous institution. The next thing must
l>e something else. "What is that something
else which must take the place of the
slavery agitation, and upon which the Re
publican party must take a clear and un
mistakable position, or give place to some
other party : It is this: Shall the tolling
millions possess and enjoy the fruit* of
their own Inhor, or shall they
have only just enough of _ their
earning* to keep them from revo
lution. while monopolist* and speculators
take the rest ? Under the head of mono
polists, we include railroad sharpers, eleva
tor thieves, high tariff plunderers, public
land grabbers. Tammany Halls; in short,
nil those who live by tfaetr wits, and pros
per by what they filch from the public.
The jteople may be slow to learn where
!he:r money goes, but they are sure to
I*am in time, and when that time comes,
Jhrre will be a serious reckoning.
The country has now reached that point
on the tpjrsfion of taxation, when the ismo
c an no longer be postponed or evaded, and
parties most take ground for, or against
that policv winch confiscates the earnings
of labor, and leaves the producer only so
nm-b as is needed to sustain the life
which he is expending ip enrich others.
The country is governed by men holding
charters ard special privileges by which
they are licensed to rob and confiscate.
I'i<k and Vanderbilt have, to-day, more
absolute control over the welfare of the
country and the industry of the people,
and a m«ve sweeping authority to help
themselves to the property of others, than
has been possessed by any sovereign in
England, since the days of the Plantag
cnets. These men, calling together a
few others, can, and do, arrange among
themselves, a minimum percentage of the
productions of the country, which
they wOI confiscate, daring the differ
ent seasons of the year. They have
just held a session at which they have in
creased, nearly a hundred fold, the rates
of freight which have been in force dur
ing the last three months. So, in all other
particulars, the country is ruled by corpo
rate monopolies. More than three hun
dred millions is taken from the producing
classes to ** protect" such infant phenom
ena as IL B. Ward, B. J. Morrell, the 1
Onondaga Silt Company, and their affiliat
ed class interests. Everywhere the hand
of monopoly is felt. It governs the rep
resenUtives of the people whose substance
is consumed. It corrupts, degrades, and
then um?s as its tools, the men selected by
the people to protect them. It overshad
ows all industries, and, except the pittance
it leaves laltor to obtain mere food, cloth
ing, and shelter, it grasps and accumulates
the entire production and earnings of the
people.
We repeat, the one absorbing issue of
the day is, Shill the American people re
main In this bondage, or shall they be
emancipated? Shall each man be entitled
to receive the entire earnings of his labor,
or shall the .larger part be taken from him
by others? Shall the laws under which
this system of confiscation has been built
Dp. and under which the producers axe be
coming impoverished, in the midst of
wealth of their own creation, be swept
away, or shall they bo continued and per
petuated ? That is the real and absorbing
ivsne in American politics, and it can no
more l>e evaded, or compromised, or post
poned, than the claims of the ■ personal
liberty of tbo citizen. The freemen...of
the land demand that their wages, the full
proceeds of their labor, shall be paid to
them, without any deduction for the bene
fit of F»«k. or Morrell, or Vanderbilt, or
Hiram Wneeler, or for any other person or
corporation claiming any special privilege
or license to prey upon the property and
earnings of tbo people.
AN OLD QUIBBLE.
Owing to a bitter personal controversy
respecting the nomination, Mr. John f.
Driggs, the Bcpublictn candidate for Con
gress in one of the Michigan districts at
the late election, was defeated by the Dem
ocratic candidate. Judge Sutherland. The
Constitution of the State of Michigan, like
that of Illinois, prohibits the election of
any person holding a judicial office to any
other office, St-le or national, daring the
judicial term for which be has been chosen,
nml for one year thereafter. Upon
this ground, several papers in Michigan
have assumed that Judge Sutherland will
nut be admitted to Congress. This Is a
very old question. It was decided seventy
y< «rs ago that no State bad.any authority
to add to. or take from Ihe qualifications
of a memlter of Congress, prescribed in
the Constitution of the United States.
More recently the same question was de
cided in the ease of several members of I
(Vngrt-K* from thi> State. The last time
tlu- objection to a member taking bis seat
under such circumstances had but five
voles in the Senate to sustain it. '
Mr. Dnggs baa published a letter in
which be concedes that Congress has al
ready decided this question, and he also
Kta'es that, even if Judge Sutherland were
unseated, be wonld not accept the place,
not having Ven elected thereto. This is
all very honorable and just on tbe part
of Mr. Driggs. But ibat gentleman, while
conceding that the ascertained law is that
a State cannot disqualify a person for a
seat in Congress who is qntUfied under the '
Federal Constitution, expresses the opin
ion that nocertifiraie of election ought to
be given to Judge Sutherland. He says t

The Constitution of the United States is,
by its own terms, declared to be the su
preme law of the land, “and the Judges
in every State shall be bound thereby,
anything in the Constitution or laws of
any State to the contrary notwithstand

repeated cases, decided by the only tribu
nal having jurisdiction of the matter, that

A SECRETARY OF BETBHOE.
A special despatch from Washington,'to
tbe New’Tork'JVifitme, contains a very
significant allusion to the Presidents
reasons for delaying tbe appointment of a
Commissioner of Internal Revenue, tosuc
ceed Ur« Delano. It says: ,
“There is much speculation here as to tbe
Presdest’s motive to po-tpaning the appointment
of a CotrmUMncer of Internal Revenue, tn the
plareofMr Dtlaoo. It was generally supposed
last this cilice would be filled oefore the meeting
of Congress, In order to avoid the pressure which
the fneods of rival candidates wilt doubtless men
btffiff to hear on General Grant. It It hinted that
the President may p'jsslbly Intend to recommend
again tte conversion of the Internal Revenue
Burtau Into a department, by combining wuhit
the cuitcm* or some other bureau of the Treasury
Department, ana to place at its bead some promi
nent man of the Republican party. Secretary
Bern well would probably oppose each a measure,
atd would be etrotgiy supported in Congress."
Whatever other criticisms have been
passed upon the Secretary of tbe Treasury,
we are not aware that he has been charged
with using thepatronage and appointments
of tbe Treasury Department as a means of
rewarding hia personal supporters, cliques,
jobs, and cabals, and punishing those
which he supposes to have been hostile to
him. The President makes it'no secret
that be is with one wing of the Republican
party against another in Kew York, Penn
sylvania, Missouri, and wherever “it has a 1
division, and that the appointments tinder
his control belong to bis special cliques,
as sgainst all other elements of the Repub
lican party. Of the various departments,
that of the Secretary of the Treasury is
tbe most Important, politically, as it con
trols some twelve thousand appointees;
end of sli the members of tbe President’s
Cabinet, Secretary BoutweU has the most
vivid Presidential aspirations. Should ihe
President advocate the creation of a new
Cabinet officer, to be known as the Secre
tary of the Revenue, at a time when our
revenue interests have been managed at
least as well as - those of the other de
partments, it will not fail to occur
to many that the effect will be
to withdraw from Secretary Bontwell abont
fonr-fiftbs of his patronage and leave hhn
a mere minister of the war debt and Pay.
master General. He will still have the
negotiation of our loans, and the payment
of onr current expenses to look after, bnt
the man whose hand will touch the pocket
nerve of the country, and whose Appoint
ments will be .expected to control the
local politics of States wtU be the new Sec
retary of the Revenue.
How far this may, In fact, interfere
with Mr.. BoutwelTs aspirations it is not
for ns to say. Neither President
nor Secretary ' arm to commend
themselves to'any other portion of the
Republican party than its protectionist
elements, and it remains to be seen
whether these will sit in the saddle and
bold the reins in the next Presidential
convention.
But without doubt, the general inference
will be that the Secretary's wings will be
clipped to prevent his soaring ont of his
prescribed limits. Such are the signs of
the times by which we are compelled to
judge of the motives of grave public
inciiEnreK, «nd of the influences which seek
to control legislation.
WATERING ” RAILWAY SHARES.
Among tbe many acknowledged evils of
railway management which our mode of
enforcing the laws has not yet reached, is
that of watering railway stock. When
roads are running at a profit, they water
their stock to prevent the public demand
for a reduction of rates of freight and fore
which would assail them were they to dia*
tribute the whole profits In dividends.
If, as in the case of the New York Central,
4he stock is watered by a “ stock divi
dend,” and the Collector of Revenue
infers that this dividend must
be income, and liable to be taxed as such,
be is informed that it is only the rise in
the value of the lands, depots, and rolling
stock. Among the railway inflationists
now at work, some of our Western compa
nies are becoming far too prominent. Tbe
Milwaukee & St. Paul Company has in
creased its capital stock by $24,174,580
within the last five years. Tbe Bock Island
basincrcascdilsstock within tbe same period
by $18,376,000. The last million of stock
was issued in defiance of an express pro
hibition thereof contained in the new Con*
aiitntion of Illinois. The Chicago &
Northwestern Railroad Company has in
creased its stock by $20,434,927. The
aggregate increase by the three com
panies amounts to $62,985,511, a sum
- -sufficient to build all tbe roads
- and buy their rolling stock. On-all these
roads there was clearly an opportunity to
have reduced the rates of freight and fare
by one-half, and still preserve to the stock
of the companies the full value per share
which it will have under these inflated is
sues. But the managers, instead of re-'
daring the freights and fares one-balf,
preferred to double the enm on which the
freights and fares are to earn their divi
dend. The proceeding is, inmost, if not all,
these cases, contrary to law and in viola
tion of the charters of tbe companies..
But as the stockholders suppose it is for
their temporary interest, and we have no
State officers whose function it is to un
derstand and look after tbe interests of the
public, tbe railway managers have it all
their own way. And their way is one
which is constantly increasing the burden
of the transportation tax on every traveller
and shipper, and on every fanner and mer
chant. Tbe people* may neglect these
evils, but they cannot avoid paying for
them.
The Legislature of North Carolina has
elected ex-Governor Vance to tbe United
States Senate, for the term commencing
the nth of March next. Already the cry is
raised that be shall not be admitted. is
said, and truly, tbatbe participated, ns Gov
ernor of tbe State, in the rebellion,. and,
therefore, never having beeh pardoned, be
is ineligible. Several other persona,
equally Ineligible, and for the same cause,
have been admitted by both booses to seats
in Congress. All that is required is the
formal passage of a resolution removing
the disqualification. - This has been done
in the cases of several persons elected to
Congress, and in ten thousand canes of
other persons. "Why should there

of Vance ? Be, has been elected ‘as

publican, the men who now object to hia
admission would have clamored for the re
moval of the legal disability. If the disa
bility of Vance be not removed, then the
real reason will bo that he is a Democrat.
This is wholly untenable; as a party act it
is most impolitic and indefensible, and,
therefore, we hope that there will be' no
objection anywhere to his admission. In

ler is desirous of being the champion of

The lug* l tanff "ng b* ve got up a scheme
to repeal the existing law which requires
the new Congress to assemble on the 4th
ol March. The object which they seek to
accomplish by this moans is to prevent the
re-election of Speaker Blaine, who is ren
dered ineligible, in their estimation, by the
revenue reform plonk in the Eopablican
platform of Maine. It will be alleged, of
course, that the law in question was passed
to curb Andrew Johnson, and that the rea
son for its enactment ceased with John
son's retirement from office. This is trae,
but it remains to be shown that the exist*
ing law is cot as good in every sense as the
rbld law which postponed the assembling of
the now Congress UUlho first Monday in
December;
'Whether the existing law shall be re

A Mcientiflc Discovery*
:There has been unearthed, within a few
weeks, in tbe vioinity of the neighboring town
nf Wtukcgan, and brought to the Academy of
Science*, in this dtv, part of the skeleton of
a species of extinct animal never before dis
covered.
Tbe specimen Is regarded bv scientific tn*n |
who have examined it, as a relic of very great
value and interest, as it supplies a link in the
history of tbe animal life of tbe past time,
which, until now, has been wanting. The
enimal is of the deer family, aud bears some
resemblance to tbe fossil oertrua Americana*,
or etag, of this conn try, but much more to the
grfe&t ItUh elk. an extinct species known only
lo Enrone. It ia, however, so far different
from tbe Utter that It must be classed as a
nsw species.
The bones were found imbedded In tho
earth, In a swampy place, In a spot which, un
titaecently, has been constantly covered with
water. They were about seven feet below the
rnrface, and beneath a layer of peat. Their
fetutton relatively to the stratification was not
different from ilut in which many other re
mains of extinct species have been found.
The akeleton indicates an animal near seven
feet in height, to iho top of the back, and not
far from nine feet to the summit of the ant
lers. The Irirh elk was several inches shorter
than Ibis, and aeompanson of the two skele
tons shows (be Waukegan species to have
been considerably more alender and graceful.
The fact of its resemblance to the European
specimen, coupled with the fact that many of
the extinct species of North America and
Northern Europe much more closely resemble
each ether then do those of the southerly por
tions of the respective countries, and the
other evidences of the two continents having
been at one time united by an iathmoa that
now lies beneath the waters of Behring's
Straits, lends sanction to the opinion of a die
tiegnubod aavatd of this city, that these two
beasts, or their progenitors, were, far
haek in the cycles, one and the same
species; that after ' the,. two land*
were separated by tho water, then gradually
underwent a change in * form, slz®,
and general characteristics, a change
Uch accounts for alltbe differences

that then they were exterminated. Tbe

theory Is right—by the difference in climate,
food, kind and extent of range, tbe character
of the beasts of prey they would be obliged to

_The corn (rade of Central Illinois is becom

no lets importance, ss farms become subdi

tbe Small farmers have not the capital to pur
chasestock for feeding, and as corn i» a good*
paying crop, and commands'ready at
nearly all seasons of tbe year,- few are dis
posed to look beyond ill
Before tbe railroads, it was sold In the
field by the acre to stock feeders.
When tbe railroads gave an
impulse to the more raptd settlement of tbe
Grand Prairie,” the new comers became
large purchasers, It was then cribbed in rail
pens in the open field. In a few yean this
demand ceased, and before the firmer was
ready to sell his crop, which was usually fat
Jane or Jaly, it wss seriously damaged by the
weather. Com thus housed could only* be
moved in balk daring the rammer season; for
it must go to Chicago, or sods other lake or
river port, and pass into the warehouse, into
large bine, where it often became injured by
heatiig; Uuovn into lake vessels to Buffalo
or Oswego, where it was transferred to the
canal, and tbns after a tedious and expensive
freight, transfers and commissions, reach'd
: the seaboard, where it was distributed to the
consumer. Now ail this is changed, and tbe
: corn trade has new conditions, that plies it
on s better footing, one much more satisfac
tory to the farmer.
Ibe pngs, tbe Board of Trade, or tbe ware
housemen of Chicago do not appear to com
prehend the changed conditions that are now
vexing them. . If we look into this matter
and study its bearings, we shall see that the
warehouse question will lose much of its ter

more importance to tbe Business men of the
city. The notorious gambling In gram, and
the want of fair dealing by eome of tbe rail
roads, and more or less of tbe warehouses ot
Chicago, no doubt gave the first dbecion to
ibis new trade, tmt has finally and penna
penttv diverted so much of the grain trade
from’that city, and it is now too late to re
gain it. In order to show what is doing, we
may notice a few noiate. On tbe 25th, the
receipts of corn at Chicago for two days was
63.790 bushels, against 50,995 during the

There la no old com in this part of the State,
and this new com tavUiopad direct to the con
sumers. Parties are, at these points, making
tbeir purchases through the local bouses.
When the fanner shells his corn he gets 3
cents a bushel above the figures named, which
is for com in the carat 70 pounds to the
bnfchf L
It will be seen that, is this new condition ol
thugs, we have no nso for
WAREHOUSES,
for they act no useful part. The fanner, at
Dixon, loads bis c-x of com. not for Chicago,
but for some point in the East. It requires do
batdHng .at Chicago or other point,
until it baa reached the point
forita consumption. There is but one com
mission to pay, and that a small one. This is
the oendition'ot the trade from November to
tbe end of April, a period of five months, and
by that time a Urge share of tbe corn crop
will have gone forward. During tho other
seven mouths, it U possible fer Chicago to re
tain » port of tbe trade: but, in order to do
this, the turning of comers, and other bod
practices, will have *0 be at andoßcO.
We can thus see th»* Chtcsgo is no longer
of anv particular tmoortatce to tbe farmer of
minora as a com market, and that at best is it
llliuuu m m w. u -■■■ .-n -M- ■ - —•-
poselble to make itof the le*st object for
more than seven oat of the twelve mouths of
tbe year. Nutber Chicago railroads, Chicago
warehousemen, nor tbe Board of Trade are a
necessity to the grain trade of the Northwest.
There are so many competing points that it
is more of an object for Chic ago to secure a
large share of this trade than it is for the
country.
If the country wu dependent on Chiagoto
purchase Iwr corn, the prices at all these
points would be eo low at this time that only a
email amount would go forward daring the
five months nam'd. This is seen in the fact
that the whole country only contrioutea as
tomb corn to Chicago as a atrip of country

tD'Vs. . ...
In going East this corn is distributed to all
the trank Tin* s. Corn from iladoon In part
comes to Calumet station, the crossing of tbo
Michigan Southern, and Pi’trbuyjh it Tort

thence East.
.This new trade is growing so rapidly that
there is to* a sufficiency cf cars to more its
receipts. On the filth there were required on
th« Indianapolis. Anon & St. .Louis Rulroad
437 ears for loading at all the sta
tions, and only 117 could be supplied. This
• tbows that the new channel for the grain
trade is becoming an important one. If these
t hinge continue, the warehouses of Chicago
bQI need be put to soms other use, and from
baring a monopoly they will haye to reduce
i lie Luriuess to the lowest poeeibie rates, in
order to eecure a chare of business.
orn in mason.
The same laws of trade that are diverting
corn from Chicago are also active in the direc
tion ot goods, iron, nail*, gla*s, boots and
shoe a, and many other staples,that come direct
from the manufacturers, and thus enable our
merchants o! the interior to comoete with
Chicago retail bouevr. The through rates
from the ptinvipal points E>st to oar towns
are almost as low as frcmCuicago It costs but
little more to lay down goods iu Maitooo, To
loro, ot Champaign from New York or Boston
than from Chicago. The immanse trade over
those lines, both ways, enable them to do
this. It is not possible for our roads to
carry so cbeaplv. though there is no
doubt that a reduction in many instances
would bo money in their treasuries.
We can see that a steady stream of com
pouring Into our interior towns must have a
good effect on them. On Saturday, tbs 19tb
ulh, there was paid ou: for com, at Mat
tcoo, 59.500, which represented, at 40 cents
a bushel, 23,750 botbele : BiOOQ of this was
on contracts, which mads the actual delivery ;
of com from farm wagons over 18.000 bushels.
If we reduce this to loads containing an aver
age of thirty bushels each, we have COO teams
in the market during one day, and,
when put in care, it will require #ity*four.

It has been remarked by Chicago bankers

Spedal Deapatch to The Chicago'Tribune.
DEFECTS OF TUB CENSUS,
Washington, Dec. 3.—U will be a long time be
fore &c< urate social statistics ot the country can
be arrived at nnder ths present census. The ,
cloter the returns are examined the more appa
rent do their defects become. Ignorance does ;
not seem to be confloed to the agents of the Cen
sus Bureau, bat appears to extend even to those
whose business operations should make them
more enlightened. Thus, la their endeavors to
obtain information, census agents were is nntner
ous instances answered as if they were Internal
revenue offierra, seeking to collect odious taxes.
The consequence of this Is that returns to the bu
reau here, so far as they relate to industrial and
economical pursuits, Invariably fall short at least
co per cent. The very localities which seem to be
the most anxious to make a favorable showing in
population are also the most backward in making
a good business or Industrial exhibit. '
Manufacturers constantly underrate the amount
of capital Invested and the vame of their annual
products, while business men generally are very
chary ot giving information. So gross have been
some of the errors In the returns, that even the
individual Information of members of the Census
Burcim felt outraged, and General Walker, to
remedy some of the most Blaring defects, has felt
califd upon to open correspondence with the
matufactnrers and business nun of the country. ■
Prom no city have returns been more de
fective ***» liom Chicago. What are
known to be some of its .greatest
interests make the nrest insignificant showing. In
the exhibit for 1870, the distillers return a caoital
Invested ot bat fs47,f CO. and an annual product ot
16,0*8.991; in lumber, an invested capital of $133.-
sro; and provisions, under which head come pork
and beef parking iDUrests, a capital of si,soi,oco,
with an annual product of $8,473,909. The total
number of industrial establishments are returned
at 1.149. with a capita) of $5T,948,c01. employing
90,196 men, and annually turning out products val
ued at $*9,738,299. Even these returns show an
increase over 1860 of ab >ot SCO per cent. It a but
Jnsttce to state That the Census Department is ex
erting every energy to remedy these abuses-,
wnlcb, under the present law, can only be done
, by conwprndenee.
Rptnixs ot population for the States are now (u,
with the exception of Pennsylvania and South
i Carolina. In the former State returns have been
received from all bat one subdivision, wbicb, by
rearfon of the' reporta having been destroyed by
i Ore, win bare to be retaken Toe so-called re
. oncers destroyed so large a number of the returns
1 In South Csrctlua, in their various nota and law
. less proceedings, during the late election, that a
new census there has also become a necessity.
Otherwise the preliminary report of this bureau
i would be ready for Congress on its flrstdayof
meeting.
Tire nbw apportionment.
Members of Congress have begun to figure on
the new apportionment on the basis of the new
cenen?. now nearly completed. So many States
are averse to losing representation that u Is
htehly probable the number of Resresentatives
tn the Donee will be increased to 2T5. Anything
uniter *hat figure. It la claimed, will make even
such Slates as Ohio lose a portion of. their weight
in the Electoral College and In the National As
sembly, while New York and Pennsylvania would
experience a heavy decease. Taking the popu
lation or the country at 39.000.0C0, It ts found tha',
with 27s aa the quotient, toe only States
that wcnld lose Representatives would Le Rhode
Island,. Vermont, New Hampshire, and Maine.
Ttese figure seem to be-those pretty generally
agreed npon as to the number to constitute the
next Ccngreff.
PIUARIf? IV TltK TREASCRT DFPAKTMENT.
Tbe bateaus of the Treasury Department have
bad prepared a tabular statement, showing the
Increase of salaries of government officials and
members of Congress from tbe organization of
the government down to the present day, with tbe
view of presenting tbe same to Congress, and urg
ing that the pay-rolls of the Treasury Department
be increased to correspond with the
increase made Id the salaries of others.
.This statement will Show tbe pay
of every grade of government offlr.’als' during
the past twenty years. The particular feature ts
the remarkable manner la which Congress hav
provided for its clerks and' officers, and even for
tuelf, while the salaries of a number of bureau
officers remain to-doy as a half century ago. This
statement will al«o show how Congress has paid
its clerks, and how it has treated clerks Id the de
partmeits. Some of tbe latter have recently had
a conference with ’he view of perfecting an or
ganization and train appealing to Congress, in
force, for an increase of pay.
