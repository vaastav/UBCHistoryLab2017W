Washington, Dec. 7.The following Is the
text of President Cleveland's message to
congress:
To the Congress of the United States:
As representatives of the people in the
legislative branch of their government, you
have assembled at a time when the
strength and excellence'of our free insti
tutions and the fitness of our citizens to
enjoy popular rule have been again made
manifest. A political contest involving
momentous consequences, fraught with
feverish apprehension and creating ag
gressiveness so intense as to approacn bit
terness and passion has been waged
throughout our land and determined by
the decree of free and "independent puf
frage, without disturbance of our tran
quillity or the least sign of weakness In our*
national structure. When we consider
these incidents and contemplate the peace
ful obedience and manly submission which
have succeeded a heated clash of political
opinions, we discover abundant evidence
of a determination on the part of our coun
trymen to abide by every verdict of the
popular will and to be controlled at all
times by an abiding faith-in the agencies
established for the direction of the af
fairs of their government.
The Turkish Question.
At the outset of a reference to the more
Important matters affecting our relations
with foreign powers, it would afford me sat
isfaction if I could assure the congress
that the disturbed condition in Asiatic Tur
key had during the past year assumed a
less hideous and bloody aspect, and that
either as a consequence of the awakening
of the Turkish government to the demand
of humane civilization, or as the result,
of decisive action on the part of the great
nations having the right by treaty to inr
terfere for the protection of those exposed
to the rage of mad bigotry and cruel
fanaticism, the shocking features of the
situation had been mitigated.
Instead, however, of welcoming a soft
ened disposition or protective intervention,
we have been afflicted by continued and
not unfrequent reports of the wanton de
struction of homes and the bloody butch
ery of men, women and children, made
martyrs to their profession of Christian
faith
Protection of Americans.
While none of our citizens in Turkey
have thus far been jellied or wounded,
though often in the midst of dreadful
scenes of danger, their safety in the fu
ture is by no means assured. Our govern
ment at home and' our minister at Con
stantinople have left nothing undone to
protect our missionaries in Ottoman terri
tory, who constitute nearly all the individ
uals residing there who have a right to
claim our protection on the score of Amer
ican citizenship.
Cuban Insurrection.
The insurrection in Cuba still continues
with all its perplexities. It is difficult to
perceive that any progress has thus far
been made towards the pacification of the
island, or that the situation of affairs as
depicted in my last annual message has
in the least improved. If Spain still holds
Havana and the seaports and all the con
siderable towns, the insurgents still roam
at will over at least two-thirds of the in
land country. If the determination of
Spain to put down the insurrecion seems
but to strengthen with the lapse of time
and is evinced by her unhesitating devotion
of largely increased military and naval
forces to the task, there is much reason to
believe that the insurgents have gained
in point of numbers and character and re
sources, and are none the less inflexible in
their resolve not to succumb without prac
tically securing the great objects for which
they took up arms.
N ot Yet Entitled to Recognition.
If Spain' has not yet reestablished her
authority, neither have the insurgents yet
made good their title to be regarded as an
independent state. Indeed, as the con
test has gone on, the pretense that civil
government exists on the island, except so
far as Spain is able to maintain it, has
been practically abandoned. Spain does
keep on foot such a government, more or
less imperfectly, in the large towns and
their immediate suburbs. But, that excep
tion being made, the entire country is either
given over to anarchy or is subject to the
military occupation of one or the other
party.
Why Spain Does Not Win.
Were the Spanish armies able to meet
their antagonists in the open, or in pitched
battle, prompt and decisive results might
be looked for, and the immense superiority
of the. Spanish forces in numbers, dis
cipline, and equipment, could hardly fail
to tell greatly to their advantage.
Situation Deplorable.
Meanwhile, as in all cases of protracted
civil strife, the passions of the combatants
grow more and more Inflamed anu excesses
on both sides become more frequent and
more deplorable. They are also partici
pated in by bands of marauders, who, now
in the name of one party and how in the
name of the other, as may best suit the
occasion, harry the country at will and
plunder its wretched inhabitants for their
own advantage. Such a condition of things
would inevitably entail immense destruction
of property, even if it were the polici'
of both parties to prevent it as lar as prac
ticable. But while such seemed to be the
original policy of the Spanish government,
It has now apparently abandoned it and .s
acting upon the same theory as the in
surgents, namely, that.the exigencies of
the contest require the'wholesale annihila
tion of property that It- may not prove of
use and advantage to the enemy. It is to
the same end that in pursuance,of general
orders, Spanish garrisons are now being
withdrawn from, plantations and the rural
fn
iopulation required to concentrate itself
the towns.
The sure result would seem to, be that
the industrial' value of the island is fast
diminishing, and that unless there is a
speedy and radical change in existing con
ditions, it will soon disappear altogether.
That value consists very largely, of
course, In its capacity to produce sugara
capacity .already much reduced by the In
terruptions to tillage, which have.taken
place during the last two years. It is re
liably asserted that should these interrup
tions continue
during, as
yea
and practically extend now
ened, to the entire sugar-producing ter
ritory of the Island, so much time and so
much money will be required to restore
the land to Its normal productiveness that
It is extremely doubtful if capital can bo

Would Engage Our Serious Attention.
The spectacle of utter ruin of an adjoin
ing country, by nature one of the most
,33j-
fertile and charming on the globe, would
engage the serious attention of the gov
ernment and the people ot the United
States in any circumstance. In point of
fact, they have a concern with it which is
by no means of a wholly sentimental
or philanthropic character. It lies so near
to us as to be hardly separated from our
territory. Our actual pecuniary interest in
it is second only to that of the people and
government of Spain. It is reasonably es
timated that at least from $30,000,000 to
$50,000,000 of American capital are invested
in plantations, and in railroad, mining
and other business enterprises on the
island. The volume of trade between the
United States and Cuba, which in 1889
amounted to about $64,000,000, rose in J893
to about $103,000,000, and in ,1894, the
year before the present insurrection
broke out. amounted to nearly $96,000,000.
Vexatious Entanglements.
Besides this large pecuniary stake in
the fortunes of Cuba, the United States
linds itself inextricably involved in the
present contest in other ways both vex
atious and costly. Many Cubans reside in
this country and indirectly promote the
insurrection through the press, by public
meetings, by the purchase and shipment of
arms, by the raising of funds and by other
means, which the spirit of our institutions
and the tenor of our laws do not permit
to be made the subject of criminal prosecu
tions. Some of them, though Cubans at
heart and in all their feelings and interests,
have taken out papers as naturalized citi
zens of the United States, a proceeding re
sorted to with a view to possible protec
tion by this government, and not unnat
urally regarded with much indignation by
the country of their origin.
The Question of Intervention.
These inevitable entanglements of the
United States with the rebellion In Cuba,
the large American property interests af
fected and considerations of philanthropy
and humanity in general have led. to a ve
hement demand in various quarters for
some sort of positive intervention on
the part of the United States. It was at
first proposed that belligerent rights should
be accorded to the insurgentsa propo
sition no longer urged because untimely
and in practical operation clearly perilous
and Injurious to our own interests. It has
since been and is now sometimes contended
that the independence of the Insurgents
should be recognized.' But imperfect and
restricted as the Spanish government of
the island maybe, no other exists there
unless the will of the military officer in
temporary command of a particular dis
trict can be dignified as a species of gov
ernment. It is now also suggested that the
United States should buy the Islanda sug
gestion possibly worthy of consideration
if there were any evidence of a desire or
willingness on the part of Spain to enter
tain such a proposal. It is urged, finally,
that, all other methods failing, the existing
internecine strife in Cuba should be ter
minated by our intervention, even at th*i
cost of a war between the United States
and Spaina war which its advocates con
fidently pronhesy could be neither large
in Its proportions nor doubtful in its issue.
Right, Sot Might, Mast Rule.
The correctness of this forecast need be
neither affirmed nor denied. The United
States has nevertheless a character to
maintain as a nation, which plainly dic
tates that right and not might should be
the rule of its conduct. Further, though
the United States is not a nation to which
peace is a necessity, it is In truth the most
pacific of powers, and desires nothing so
much as to live in amity with all the world.
Its own ample and diversified domains sat
isfy all possible longings for territory, pre
clude all dreams of conquest, and prevent
any 'casting of covetous eyes upon neigh
boring regions, however attractive.
Spain Should Grant Autonomy.
It is in the assumed temper and dispo
sition of the Spanish government to rem.
edy these grievances, fortified by indica
tions of influential public opinion in Spain,
that this government has hoped to discover
the most promising and effective means of
composing the present strife, with honor
and advantage to Spain and with the
achievement of all the reasonable objects
of the insurrection. It would seem that
if Spain should offer to Cuba genuine
autonomya measure of home rule which,
while preserving the sovereignty of Spain,
would satisfy all rational requirements of
her Spanish subjectsthere should be no
just reason why the pacification of the
island might not be effected on that basis.
Objections Answered.
It has been objected on the one side that
Spain should not promise autonomy until
her insurgent subjects lay down their
arms on the other side, that promised au
tonomy, however liberal, is insufficient, be
cause without assurance of the promise be
ing fulfilled, but the reasonableness of a re
quirement by Spain, of unconditional sur
render on the part of the insurgent Cubans
before their autonomy is conceeded, is not
altogether apparent. It ignores important
features of the situationthe stability of
two years' duration has given to the in
surrection the feasibility of its indefinite
prolongation in the nature of things,
and as shown by past experience, the
utter and imminent ruin of the island, un
less the present strife is speedily composed
above all, the rank abuses which all par
ties in Spain, all branches of her govern
ment and all her leading public men con
cede to exist and profess a desire to re
move. Facing such circumstances to with
hold the proffer of needed reforms until
the parties demanding them put them
selves at mercy by throwing down their
arms has the appearance of neglecting the
gravest of perils and inviting suspicion as
to the sincerity of any professed willingness
to granf reforms.
The objection on behalf of the insurgents
that proposed reforms cannot be relied
uponmust of course be considered, though
we have no right to assume and no reason
for assuming that anything Spain under-:
takes to do for the relief of Cuba will not
be done according to both the spirit and
the letter of the Undertaking.
Offered Our (Services.
Nevertheless, realizing that suspicions
and precautions on the 'part of the weak
er of two combatants are always natural
and not always unjustifiablebeing sin
cerely desirous in the interest of both, as
well as on its own account that the Cuban
problem should be solved with the least
possible delay, it was intimated by this
government to the government of Spain
some months ago that, if a satisfactory
measure of home rUie were tendered the
Cuban insurgents, and would be accepted
by them upon a guaranty of its execution,
the United States would endeavor to find
a way not objectionable to Spain of fur
nishing such guaranty. While no definite
response to this intimation has yet been
received from the Spanish government, it
is believed, to be not altogether unwelcome.
A Limit to Our Patience.
Whatever circumstances may arise, our
policy and our interests would constrain us
to object to the acquisition of the island or
an interference with its control by any
other power. It should be added that it
cannot be reasonably assumed that the
hitherto expectant attitude of the United
States will be indefinitely maintained.
While we are anxious to accord all due re
spect to the sovereignty of Spain, we can
not view the pending conflict, in all its
features and properly apprehend our in
evitably close relations'to it and its pos
sible results without considering that by
the course of events we may be drawn Into
such an unusual and unprecedented con
dition as will fix a limit to our patient
waiting for Spain to end the contest, either
alone and in her own way, or with our
friendly cooperation.
Deferring the choice of ways and meth
ods until the time for action arrives, we
should make them depend upon the pre
cise conditions then existing and they
should not be determined upon without
giving careful heed to every consideration
involving our honor and interest, or the
international duty we owe* to Spain. Until
we face the contingencies suggested, or
the situation is by other incidents impera
tively changed, we should continue in the
llMe of conduct heretofore pursued,' thus
in all circumstances exhibiting our obedi
ence to the requirements of public law and
our regard for the duty enjoined upon us
by the position we occupy In the fanjily of
nations.
Venezuelan Question. 'J
The Venezuelan boundary question has
ceased to be a matter of difference between
Great Britain and the United States, their
respective governments having agreed
upon the substantial provisions of a treaty
between Great Britain and Venezuela, sub
mitting the whole controversy to arbitra
tion. The provisions of the treaty are so
eminently just and fair, that the assent of
Venezuela thereto may confidently be an
ticipated.
General Arbitration with Great Britain.
Negotiations for a treaty of general ar
bitration for all differences between Great
Britain and the United States are far ad
vanced, and promise to reach a successful
consummation at an early date..
Our 'Finances.
The secretary of the treasury reports
that during the fiscal year ended June 80,
1896, the receipts of the government from
all sources amounted to $409,475,408.78. Dur
ing the same period its expenditures were
$434,678,654.'*!', the excess of expenditures
over receipts amounting to $25,203,245.70.
The ordinary expenditures during the year
were $4,015,852.21 less than during the pre
ceding fiscal year. Of the receipts men
tioned, there were derived from customs
the sum of $1S0,021,751.67 and from internal
revenue $146,830,615.66. The receipts from
customs show an Increase of $7,863,134.22
over those from the same source for the
fiscal year ended June 30, 1895, and the re
ceipts from Internal revenue an increase of
$3,584,537.01.
Imports and Exports.
The value of our imported dutiable mer
chandise during the last fiscal year was?
$269,757,170, and the value of free goods im
ported $409,967,470, being an increase of $6,-
523,675 in the value of dutiable goods and
$41,231,034 in the value of freer goods over
the preceding year. Our exports of mer
chandise, foreign and domestic, amounted
in value to $882,606,938, being an increase
over the preceding year of $75,068,773. The
average ad valorem duty.paid on dutiable
goods imported during tne year was 39.94
per cent, and on free and dutiable goods
taken together 20.55 per cent.
Movement of Metallic Money.
The total amount of gum exporieuduring
the last liscal year was $112,409,947 and of
silver $60,541,670, being an increase of $46,-
941,466 of gold, and $13,246,3S4 of silver over
the exportations of the preceding fiscal
ytar. The imports of gold were $33,525,066,
and of silver $28,777,186, being $2,859,695 less
of gold, and $8,566,007 more of silver than
during the preceding year. The total stock
of metallic money in the United States at
the close of the last fiscal year ended on
the 30th day of June, 1S96, was $1,228,326,-
035, of which $599,597,964 was in gold, and
$628,728 071 in silver.
Per Capita Circulation of 822.03.
On the. first day of November. 1896, the
total stock of money of all kinds in the
country. was $2,285,410,590, and the amount
in circulation, not including that in the
treasury holdings, was $1,627,055,641, being
$22.63 per capita, upon an estimated popula
tion of 71,902,000.
National Banks.
The number cf national banks organized
from the time the'law authorizing their
creation was passed, up to October 31, 1896,
was 5,051, and cf this number 3,379 were at
the date last mentioned in active opera
tion, having authorized carital stock of
$650,014,895, help! by 288.902 shareholders, and
circulating notes amounting to $2117412,620.
The total outstanding circulating notes of
all national banks on the 31st day of Oc
tober, 1896, amounted to $234,553,807 includ
ing unredeemed, but fully secured notes
of banks insolvent and in process of liqui
dation The increase in national bank cir
culation during the year ending on that
day was $21,099,429. On October 6,1896, when
the condition bf national banks was last
reported, the total resources of the 3,679
active institutions was $3,263,685,313.83,
which included $1,893,268,839.03 in loans and
discounts and $302,165,733.85 in money of all
kinds on hand. Of their liabilities $1,597,-
891,058.03 was due to individual depositors
and. $209,944,019 consisted of outstanding cir
culating notes.. There were organized dur
ing the year preceding the date last men
tioned 28 national banks, located in 15
states, of which 12.were organized in the
eastern states with a capital of $1,180,000,
six in the western states with a capital of
$875,000, and ten in the southern, states with
a capital of $1,190,000. During the year,
however, 37 banks voluntarily abandoned
their franchises under the national law,
and in the case of 27 others it was found
necessary to appoint receivers. Therefore,
as compared with 'the year preceding, there
was a decrease of 36 in the number of
active banks. The number of existing
banks organized under state laws is
5,708.
Immigration.
The number of immigrants arriving in
the United States during the fiscal year was
343,267. of whom 340,468 were permitted to
land, and 2,799 were debarred on various
grounds prescribed by law, and returned
to the countries whence they came, at the
expense of the steamship company by
which they were brought in. The increase
in immigration over the preceding year
amounted to 84,131 It is reported that with
some exceptions the immigrants of the pas'
year were of a hardy laboring class, accus
tomed and able to earn a support for them
selves, and it is estimated that the money
brought with them amounted to at least
$5,000,000. Though it was probably much in
excess of that sum, since only those having
less than $30 are required to disclose the
exact amount) and it is known that many
brought considerable sums of money to
buy land and build homes. Including all
the immigrants arriving who were over
14 years of age, 28.63 per cent, were illit
erate as against 20.37 per cent, of those of
that age arriving during the preceding fis
cal year.
Work of the Life Savers.
From the life-saving service it is re
ported that the number of disasters to
documented vessels within the limits of its.
operations during the year was 437. These
vessels had on board 4,608 persons, of
whom 4,595 were saved and 13 lost. The
value of such vessels is estimated at $8,^80,-
140, and of their cargoes, $3,846,380, making
the total value of property imperiled S12:-
726,520. Of this amount $11,292,707 was
saved and $1,432,750 was lost.
The Army.
The report of the secretary of war ex
hibits satisfactory conditions in the sev
eral branches of the public service in
trusted to his charge. The limit of our mil
itary force, as fixed by law, is constantly
and readily maintained. The present dis
cipline and, morale of our army are excel
lent, and marked progress and efficiency
are ^apparent throughout its entire organi
zation.
With the exception of delicate duties in
the suppression of slight- Indian dis
turbances along our southwestern boun
dary, in which the Mexican troops cooper
ated, a'nd the compulsory but peaceful re
turn, with the consent of Great Britain, of
a band of Cree Indians from Montana to
the British possessions, no active opera
tions have been required of the army dur
ing the year past.
Changes in methods of administration,
the abandonment of unnecessary posts and
consequent concentration of troops and
the exercise of care and vigilance by the
various officers charged with the responsi
bility in the expenditure of appropriations
have resulted in reducing to a minimum
the cost of maintenance of our military es
tablishment. During the past year the
work of constructing permanent infantry
and cavalry posts, has been continued at
the places heretofore designated. The sec
retary of war repeats his recommendation
that appropriations for barracks and quar
ters should more strictly conform to the
needs of the service, as judged by the de
partment, rather than respond to the
wishes and importunities of localities. It
Is imperative that much of the money pro
vided for such construction should now be
allotted to the erection of necessary quar
ters for the garrisons assigned to the coast
defenses, where many men will be needed
to properly care for and operate modern
guns. It is essential, too, that early pro
vision be made to supply the- necessary
force of artillery to meet the demands of
this service.
The Militia.
The organized militia numbers 112,879 men.
The appropriations for its support by the
several states approximate $2,800,000 an
nually, and $400,000 are contributed by the
general government. Investigation shows
these troops to be usually drilled and in
spired with much military interest, but in
many Instances they are so deficient in
proper arms and equipment that a sudden
call to active duty would find them in
adequately prepared for field service. 1
therefore recommend that prompt meas-
ures be taken to remedy this condition an1
that every encouragement be given to
this deserving body of unpaid and volun
tary citizen soldiers, upon whose assist
ance we must largely rely in time of
trouble.
Sea Coast Defenses.
During the past year rapid progress has
been made toward the completion of the
scheme adopted for the erection and arma
ment of
fortificationshaalong
our
,5 equal progress been madseacoast, in pro
viding the material for submarine defense
in connection with these works. It is pecul
iarly gratifying at this time to note the
great advance that has been made in this
important undertaking since the date of
my annual message to the Fifty-third con
gress at the opening of its second ses
sion, in December, 1893. At that time I in
formed the congress of the approaching
completion of 9 12-inch, 20 10-inch and 34
8:inch high power steel guns and 75 12-inch
rifled mortars.
This total then seemed insignificant when
compared with the great work remaining
to be done. Yet it was none the less a
source of satisfaction to every citizen
when he reflected that it represented the
first installment of the new ordnance of
American design and American manufac
ture, and demonstrated our ability to sup
ply from our own resources guns of unex
celled power and accuracy. At that date,
however, there were practically no car
riages upon which to mount those guns,
and only 31 emplacements for guns and 64
for mortars. Nor were all these emplace
ments in condition to receive their arma
ment. Only one high-power gun was at
that time in position for the defense of the
entire coast. Since that time the number
of guns actually completed has been in
creased to 21 12-inch 56 ten-inch 61 eight
inch high-power breech-loading steel ten
rapid-fire guns and 80 12-ii.ch rifled mor
tars. In addition there are in process of
construction of one 16-inch type gun, 50 12-
inch, 56 ten-inch, 27 eight-inch high-power
guns and 66 12-inch rifled mortars in all
428 guns and mortars.
During the same year immediately pre
ceding the message referred to the rir3t
modern gun carriage had been completed
and 11 more were in process of construc
tion. Ail but one were of the non-disap
pearing type.. These, however, were not
such as to secure necessary cover for the
artillery gunners against the intense fire
of mouern machine rapid-fire and high
power guns. The inventive genius. of
ordnance and civilian experts has been
taxed in designing carriages that would
obviate this lault, resulting, it is believed,
in the solution of this difficult problem.
Since 1893 the number of gun carriages conT
structed or building has been raised to a
total of 7.29, of which 90 are ori the disap
pearing principle, and the number of mor
tar carriages to 152, while the 95 emplace
ments wnitih were provided for prior to
mat time have been increased to 280 built
and bunding. This improved situation is
largely uue to the recen. generous response
of congress to tne recommendations of
uie war department. Thus we sh&n Boon
have compete, a .jout one-hfth of tne com
prenensive- system, the first step in which
was noteu in my message to the congress
of December 4, 1893.
The Postal Service.
The post oiriee cepartment is in good
conaition, and the exhibit made of its op-'
erations during the fiscal year ended uue
SJ, is'jf, if allowance is made lor imper
fections in the laws applicable to it, is very
satisfactory. The total receipts during the
year were $S2,49,20*.40. Tne total ex
penditures were $ao,62(j,296.84, exclusive of
$1,669,898.27, which was earned by the Pa
cific railroad lor transportation and cred
ited on their debt to the government. There
was an increase of receipts over the pre
vious year of $5,516,080.21, or 7.1 per cent.,
and an increase of expenditures of $3,836,-
124.02, or 4.42 per cent. The deficit was
$1,679,956.19, less than that of the preceding
year.
Abuse of Second-Class Rates.
The deficit for the last year, although
much less than that of the last and pre
ceding years, emphasizes the necessity for
legislation to correct the growing abuse
of second-class rates, to which the de
ficiency is mainly attributable. The trans
mission at the rate bf one cent a pound
of serial libraries, advertising sheets,
"house organs" (periodicals advertising
some particular "house" or institution),
sample copies and the like ought certainly
to be discontinued.
Expenditures.
The remainder of our postal revenue,
amounting to something more than $5,000,-
000, was derived from, box rents, registry
fees, money-order business and other simi
lar items. The entire expenditures of the
department, including pay for transporta
tion credited to the Pacific railroads, was
$92,186,195.11, which, may be considered as
the cost of receiving, carrying and deliv
ering the above mail matter. It thus ap
pears that though the second-class mat
ter constituted more than two-thirds ot
the total that was carried, the revenue
derived from it was less than one-thirtieth
of the total expense. The average revenue
from each pound of first-class matter was
92 cents. From each pound of second
class, 8% mills. (Of the second class 52,348,-
297 was county-free matter). From each
pound of third class, 13.1 cents. From each
pound of fourth class, 15.6 cents. The
growth of weight of second-class matter
has been from 299,000,000 pounds in 1894 to
312,000,000 pounds in 1895, and to almost
349,000,000 in 1896, and it is quite evident this
increasing drawback is far outstripping any
possible growth of postal revenues.
Abuses Must Be Corrected.
Our mail service should of course be
such as to meet the wants and even the
conveniences of our people, at a direct
charge upon them so light as perhaps to
exclude the idea of our post office depart
ment being a money-making concern but
in the face of a constantly recurring de
ficiency in its revenues, and in view of the
fact that we supply the best mail service
in the world, it seems to me it is quite time
to correct the abuses that swell enor
mously our annual deficit. If we concede
the public policy of carrying weekly news
papers free in the county of publication,
and even the policy of carrying at less
than one-tenth of their cost other bona
fide newspapers and periodicals, there can
be no excuse for subjecting the service to
the further immense and.Increasing loss
involved in carrying at the nominal rate
of one cent a pound the serial libraries,
sometimes including trashy and even
harmful literature, and other matter
which, under the loose interpretation of
a loose. statute, has been gradually given
second-class rates, thus absorbing all
profitable returns derived from first-class
matter, which pays three or four times
more than its cost, and producing a large
annual loss to be paid by general .taxation.
If such second-class matter paid merely
the cost of its handling^our deficit would
disappear and a surplus result which
might be used to give the people still better
mail facilities or cheaper rates of letter
postage. I recommend that legislation be
at once enacted to correct these abuses and
introduce better business ideas in the reg
ulation of our postal rates.
The Navy.
The work of the navy department and Its
present condition are fully exhibited in the
report of the secretary. The construction
of vessels for our new navy has been ener
getically prosecuted by the present admin
istration upon the general lines previously
adopted, the department having seen no
necessity for radical change in prior meth
ods, under which the work was found to be
progressing in a manner highly satisfac
tory. It has been decided, however, to pro
vide in every shipbuilding contract that the
builder should pay all trial expenses, and
It has also been determined to pay no speed
premiums In future contracts. The pre
miums recently earned and some-yet to be
decided are features of the contracts made
before this conclusion
waswere reachedcommis
On March 4, 1893, there
early spring
in
sion but two armored vessels, the doubles
turreted monitors Miantonomah and Mon
terey. Since that date, of vessels thereto
fore authorized, there have been placed in
their first commission three first-class and
two second-class battle ships, two armored
cruisers, one harbor defense ram and five
double-turreted monitors, including the
Maine and the Puritan, Just completed.
Eight new armored cruisers and. two new
gunboats have also been commissioned.
The Iowa, another battle ship, will be com
pleted about March 1, and at least four
more gunboats will be ready for sea in the
Equal to the Best.
It is gratifying to state that our ships
and their outfits are believed to be equal
to the best that can be manufactured else
where, and that such notable reductions
have been made in their cost as to justify
the statement that quite a number of ves
sels are now being constructed "at rates as
low as those that prevail in European ship
yards.
There have been authorized by congress
since March, 1893, five battle ships, six
light-draft gunboats, 16 torpedo boats and
one submarine torpedo boat. Contracts
for the building of all of them have been
let. The secretary expresses the opinion
that we have for the present a sufficient
supply of cruisers and gunboats, and that
hereafter the construction of battle ships
and torpedo boats will supply our needs.
Department of the Interior.
The report of the secretary of the interior
presents a comprehensive and interesting
exhibit of the numerous and important ar
fairs committed to his supervision. It i
impossible in this communication to do
more than briefly refer to a few of the sub
jects concerning which the secretary gives
full and Instructive information.
The money appropriated on account of
this department and for its disbursement
for the fiscal year ended Jurie 30, 189%
amounted to more than $157,000,000, or a.
greater sum than was appropriated for the
entire maintenance of the government tor
the two fiscal years ended June 30. 1861.
The Public Domain.
Our public lands, originally amounting
to 1,840,000,000 acres, have been so reducea
that only about 600,000,000 acres still remain
in government control, excluding Alaska.
The balance, being by far the most valuable
portion, has been given away to settlers,
to new states, and to railroads, or sold at
a comparatively nominal sum. The patent
ing of lands in execution of railroad grants
has progressed rapidly during the year,
and since the 4th day of March, 1893, about
25,000,000 acres have thus been conveyed to
these' corporations.
I agree with the secretary that the re
mainder of our public lands should be
more carefully dealt with and their aliena
tion guarded by batter economy and greater
prudence.
The Indians.
The total Indian population of the United
States is 177,235, according to a census
made in 1895, exclusive of those within the
state of New York and those comprising
the five civilized tribes: Of this number
there are approximately 38,000 children of
school age. During the year 23,393 of these
were enrolled in schools. Tne progress
which has attended recent efforts to ex
tend Indian school facilities arid the an
ticipation of continued liberal appropria
tions to that end, cannot fail to afford the
utmost satisfaction to those who believe
that the education of Indian children is a
prime factor in the accomplishment of
Indian civilization.
Conditions Improved.
It may be said in general terms, that in
every particular the improvement of the
Indians under government has been
most marked and encouraging. The sec
retary, the commissioner of Indian affairs
and the agents having charge of In
dians to whom allotments have been made
strongly urge the passage of a law pro
hibiting the sale of liquor to allottees who
have taken their lands in severalty. I
earnestly join in this recommendation.
Allotment of Lands.
A commission organized and empowered
under several recent laws is now negotiat
ing with these Indians for the relinquish
ment of their courts and the division of
their common lands in severalty and are
aiding in the settlement of the trouble
some question of tribal membership. The
reception of their first proffers of negotia
tion were not encouraging, but through pa
tience and such conduct on their part as
demonstrated that their intentions were
friendly and in the interest of the tribes
the prospect of success has become more
promising. The effort should be to save
these Indians from the consequences of
their own mistakes and improvidence and
to secure to the real Indian his rights as
against intruders and professed friends
who profit by his retrogression.
I indorse the recommendation made by
the present secretary of the interior as
well as his predecessor that a permanent
commission consisting of three members,
one of whom shah be an army officer, be
created to perform the duties now devolv
ing upon the commissioner and assistant
commissioner of Indian affairs. The man
agement of the bureau involves such nu
merous and diverse details and the ad
vantages of an uninterrupted policy are so
apparent that I hope the change suggested
will meet the approval of the congress.
Pensions.
The diminution of our enormous pen
sion roll and the decrease of pension ex
penditure which have been so often confi
dently foretold, still fail in material reali
zation. The number of pensioners on the
rolls at the close of the fiscal year ended
June 30,1896, was 970,678. This is the largest
number ever reported. The amount paid
exclusively for the pensions during the
year was $138,214,761.94, a slight decrease
from that of the preceding year, while the
total expenditures on account of pensions,
including the cost of maintaining the de
partment and expenses attending pension
distribution amounted to $142,206,550.59, or
within a very small fraction of one-third
of the entire expense of supporting the gov
ernment during the same year. The num
ber of new pension certificates issued was
90,640. Of these, 40,374 represent original al
lowances of claims and 15,878 increase of
existing pensions. The number of per
sons receiving pensions from the United
States, but residing in foreign countries,
at the close of the last fiscal year was 3,781,
and the amount paid to them during the
year was $582,735.38.
Abuses Are Demoralizing.
In my opinion, based upon such state
ments as these and much other informa
tion and observation, the abuses which
have been allowed to creep into our pen
sion system have done incalculable harm
in demoralizing our people and undermin
ing good citizenship. I have endeavored
within my sphere of official duty to pro
tect our pension roll and make it what
it should be, a roll of honor, containing
the names of those disabled in. their coun
try's service and worthy of their coun
try's affectionate remembrance.
The Pacific Railroads.
The secretary calls attention to the pub
lic interests involved in an adjustment of
the obligations of the Pacific railroads to
the government. I deem it to be an impor
tant duty to especially present this subject
to the consideration of the congress. On.
January 1, 1897, with the amount already
matured, more than $13,000,000 of the prin
cipal of the subsidy bonds issued by the
United States in aid of the construction of
the Union Pacific railway, including its
Kansas line, and more than $6,000,000 of like
bonds issued in aid of the Central Pacific
railroad, including those issued to the
Western Pacific Railroad company, will
have fallen due and been paid or must on
that day be paid by the government. With
out any reference to the application of the
sinking fund now In the treasury, this will
create such a default on the part of these
companies to the government as will give
it the right to at once institute proceed
ings to foreclose its mortgage lien.
In addition to this indebtedness, which
will be due January 1, 1897, there will ma
ture between that date and January 1,1899
the remaining principal of such subsidy
bonds, which must also be met by the gov
ernment. These amount to more than $20,-
000,000 on account of the Union Pacific
lines, and exceed $21,000,000 on account of
the Central Pacific lines. The situation ot
these roads and the condition of their in
debtedness to the government have been
fully set forth in the reports of various
committees to the present and prior con
gresses and as early as 1887 they were
thoroughly examined by a special commis
sion appointed pursuant to an act of con
gress. The considerations requiring an ad
justment of the government's relations to
the companies have been clearly presented
and the conclusion reached with practical
uniformity, that if these relations are not
terminated they should be revised-upon a
basis securing their safe continuance.
Must Take Action.
In the case of the Union Pacific company*
however, the' situation has become es
pecially and immediately urgent. Proceed
ings have been instituted to foreclose a
first mortgage upon those aided parts
the main lines upon which the govern-1ot'
