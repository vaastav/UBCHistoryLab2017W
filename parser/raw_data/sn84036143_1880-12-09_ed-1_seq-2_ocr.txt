F> Uön -Citizen* of thr Senate and Hotinc of
flcjtrescntafirrs :
I congratulate you on the continued and
increasing prosperity of our country. By
the favor of Divine Providence we have been
blessed during the past year with health,
with abundant harvests, with profitable em
ployment for all our people, and with con
tentment at home and peace and friendship
with other nations.
Lesson of the Recent Election.
The occurrence of the 24th election of Chief
Magistrate has afforded another opportunity
to the people of the United States to exhibit
to the world a significant example of the
peaceful and safe transmission of power and
authority of the Government from public ser
vants, whose terms of office are about to ex
pire, to their newly chosen successors. This
example cannot fail to impress > profoundly
the thoughtful people of other countries with
the advantages which Republican institu
tions offer. The immediate, general and
cheerful acquiescence of all good citizens in
the result of the election gives a gratifying
assurance to our country and to its friends
throughout the world that a Government
based on the free consent of an intelligent
and patriotic people possesses elements of
strength, stability and permanency not found
in any other form of government.
Suppression of Suffrage in the South.
Continued opposition to the full and free
enjoyment of the rights of citizenship con
ferred upon- colored people, by. the recent
amendments to the Constitution atiil prevails
in several of the late Mavê~Stâtes. It has per

As long a* j
the victory- uchieved. This determination
proceeds from no hostile sentiment or feeling
to any part of the people of onr country, or
to any of their interests. The inviolability
of these amendments rests upon the funda
mental principle of our government: they
are the solemn expression of the will of the
people of the United States. The senti
ment that the constitutional right
of all our (itizen-s must be maintained does
not grow weaker. It will continue to con
trol the government of tin* country. Hap
pily the history of the late election shows
that iu many parts of the country, where
opposition to the 15th amendment has pre
vailed, it is diminishing and is likely to
eease altogether if firm and w ell considered
action is taken by Congress. I trust the
House of Representatives and the Senate,
w hich have the right to judge of the election
returns and qualifications of their own raem
ers, w ill sec to it that every case of viola
tion of the letter or spirit of the 15th amend
ment is thoroughly investigated, and that no
l>euetit from such violation shall accrue to
any person or party. It will be the duty of
the Executive, with sufficient appropriations
for the purpose, to prosecute unsparingly all
who have l>een engaged iu depriving citizens
of the rights guaranteed to them by the Con
stitution.
Popular Education.
It i» not, however, to be forgotten that the
best and surest guarantee of the -primary
rights of citizenship is to be found in that
capacity for self protection which can belong
only to a people whose right to universal
suffrage is supported by universal education.
The means at the command of the local and
State authorities are in many cases w holly
inadequate to furnish free instruction to all
who need it. This is especially true where,
before emancipation, the education of the
people was neglected or prevented in the in
terest of slavery. Firmly convinced that the
subject of popular education deserves the
earnest attention of the people of the whole
country, and with a dew to wise and com
prehensive action by the Government of the
United States, I respectfully recommend
that Congress, by suitable legislation and
with proper safeguards, supplement the local
educational funds of the several .States
where the grave duties and responsibilities
of citizenship have been devolved on unedn
catcd people, by devoting to the purpose
grants of the public lands, and if necessary
by appropriations from the Treasury of the
United States. Whatever the Government
can fairly do to provide free popular educa
tion ought to be done. Wherever general
education is found, peace, virtue aud social
order prevail and civil and religious lilxrty
arc secure.
Civil Sen ice Reform.
in
may i
«m-lnsf.-esiiooM
In my former annual messages 1 have
asked the attention of Congress to the urgent
necessity of a reformation of the civil sen ice
system of the government. My views con
cerning the dangers of patronage or appoint
ments for personal or political consideration
have been strengthened by my observation
and experience in the Executive office, and I
believe the dangers threaten the stability
of government. Abuses so serious in their
nature cannot be permanently tolerated.
They tend to become more alarming with the
enlargement of administrative service. With
the grow th of the country- in population in
creases the number of officers and policemen
employed, and the reasons are imperative for
the adaptation of fixed rules for the regula
tion of appointments, promotion, pay, and re
movals, establishing a uniform method having
exclusively in every- instance the attainment
of the best qualifications for the position in
question. Buch a method alone is con
sistent with the equal rights of all citizens
and the most economical and efficient ad
ministration of the public business. Compet
itive examinations in aid of impartial ap
pointments and promotions have been con
ducted for some years past in several of. the
executive departments, and by my direction
this system has been adopted in the custom
houses and postoffices of the larger cities of
the country. In the city of New York over
2,000 persons in the civil service
have been subject on their appoint
ments and tenure of place to
the operation of published rules for the pur
pose. During the past two years the results
of these practical tests have lxen very satis
factory, and have confirmed my opinion in
favor of this system of selection. All are subr
jected to the same tests, and the result is
free from prejudice by personal favor or par-f
tizan influence. It secures for the position ap
plied for the best qualifications attainable
among the competing applicants.. It.js.an eT
feetual protection from the pressure
of importunity which, .under- any other
course pursued. largely exacts .the
time- and attention -"of appointing
officers, to their great detriment In ' tue ' dis

abuse of the service for the' mete furtherance

tin uance-of these labors gratuitously ought
not to be expected, and wdömUt au appropria
tion by Congress for compensation it is not
practicable to extend ihe system of examina
tions generally throughout* the civil service,
■
It is also highly important that all such ex
aminations shall be conducted upon a uni
form system and under general supervision.
Section 1753 of the Revised Statu tea, au
thorizes the President to prescribe
regulations for admission to the civil
service of the United States, and for this pur
pose to employ suitable persons to conduct
the requisite inquiries with reference to the
fitness of each candidate in respect to age,
health, character, know-ledge and ability for
the branches of service into which be seeks
.
to
I
to enter, but the law is practically inopera
tive for vvant of the requisite appropriation.
I therefore recommend an appropriation of
125,000 per annum to meet the expenses of a
committee to be appointed by the President
in accordance with the aims* of this section,
whose duty it shall be to deviate a
just, uniform and efficient system of com
petitive examination, and to supervise* the
application of the same throughout the en
tire civil service of the Government. Iam
persuaded that the facilities which such a
commission will afford for the testing of the
fitness of those who apply for office will not
only be as welcome a relief to members of
Congress as it will be to the President and
heads of departments, but that it will also
tend to remove the causes of embarrassment
which now inevitably and constantly attend
the conflicting claims of patronage between
the legislative and executive departments.
The most effectual check upon the pernicious
competition of influence and official favorit
ism in the bestowal of office will be the sub
stitution of an open competition of merit be
tween the applicants, in which every one
can make his own record, with the assurance
that his success will depend upon this alone.
I also recommend such legislation as,
while leaving every officer as free as
any other citizen to express his political
opinion and to use his means for their
advancement, shall also enable him to
feel as safe as any private citizen in
refusing all demands upon his salary for po
litical purposes. A law which should thus
guarantee true liberty and justice to all who
are engaged in the public service, and like
wise certain stringent provisions against the
use of official authority to coerce the politi
cal action of private citizens or of official
subordinates, Is greatly to be desired. The
most serious obstacle, however, to an im
provement of the civil service, and especially
to reform in the method of appointment
and removal has been found to lx- the
practice under what is known as the spoils
system, by which the appointing power has
been so largely emxouehed upon by mem
lxrs of Congress. The first step in the re
form of the civil service must be a complete
divorce between Congress aud the Executive
in the matter of appointments. The cor
rupting doctrine that "to the victors belong
the spoils" is as inseparable from Congres
sional patronage as tl e established rule and
practice of parties in power. It seems lo be
understood by applicants for office aud by
the people generally that Representatives
aud Senators are entitled to disburse the pa
tronat "of their respective districts and
States. It is not necessary to recite at length
the evil resulting from this invasion of the
Executive functions. The true principles of
government on the subject of appointments
to office, as stated in the national conventions
of the leading parties of the country, have
again aud again been approved by the Amer
ican people and have not been called in ques
tion in any quarter. These authentic ex
pressions of public opinion upon this all
important project are the statement of prin
ciples that belong to the constitutional
structure of the government. Under the Con
stitution the President and heads of depart
ments are to make nominations for office. The
Senate Ls to advise aud consent to the ap
pointments and the House of Representatives
Is to accuse and proseente faithless officers.
The best interest of the public service de
mands that these distinctions be respected,
aud that Senators and Representatives
who may be judges and accusers should not
dictate appointments to office. To this end
the co-operation of the legislative depart
ment of the Government is requested alike
by the necessities of the case and by public
examination. Members of Congress will not !>e
relieved from the demands made upon
them with reference to appointments
to office until by legislative enactment the
pernicious practice is condemned and forbid
den. It is, therefore, recommended that au
Act be passed defining the relations of mem
bers of Congress with respect to appointment
to offices by the President. It is also recom
mended that the provisions of Sec. 1767 and
of the sections following, of the Revised Stat
utes, comprising the Tenure of Office Act of
March 2d, 1876. lx repealed. Believing that
te reform the system, and methods of the
civil service of ourceuutry is one of the high
est and most imperative duties of statesman
ship, and that it can be permanently done
only,by the co-operation of the Legislative
and Executive departments of the Govern
ment,',! again recommend, the,.entire-subject

to intelligent and virtuous immigrants of all
creeds that part of our domain which has
been in a great degree dosed to general immi

ment of the Territory of Utah be reorganized.
I recommend that Congress provide a gov

Judges, or Commissioners appointed by the

government analagous to the provisional gov
ernment established for the territory north
west of the Ohio by the ordinance of 17r7
If, however, it is deemed best to continue the
existing form of local government, I recoin
mend that the right to vote, hold office, and
sit on juries iu the Territory of Utah, be con
fined to those who neither practice nor uphold
polygamy. If thorough measures arc- adopt
ed, it is believed that within a few years the
evils whieh now afflict Utah will bo eradieat

Our Foreign Relations--At Peace with
all the World.
Our relations with all foreign countries
have been those of undisturbed peace, and
have presented no occasion for concern as to
their continued maintenance.
In-Shore Fisheries.
My anticipation of an early reply from the
British Government to the demand for in
demnity to our fishermen for injuries suffered
by that industry at Fortune Bay, in January
1878, which I expressed in my last annual
message, was disappointed. This answer
was received only in the latter part of April
in the present year, and when received
exhibited a .failure of accord between the
two governments as to the measures of the
inshore fishing privileges secured to our
fishermen by the treaty of Washington, and
was of so serious a character that I made it
the subject of a communication to Congress
in which I recommended the adoption ot
measures which seemed to me proper to be
taken by this Government in the mainten
ance of the rights accorded to our fishermen
under the treaty, aud towards the security of
anindemnity forth« injury these interests had
suffered. A bill to carry out these recom
mendations was under consideration by the
House of Representatives at the time of ad
journment of Congress in June last. Within
a few weeks I have received a communica
tion from Her Majesty's Government, renew
ing the consideration of the subject, both of
indemnity for injuries at Fortune Bay and
of the interpretation of the treaty, in which
the previous correspondence had shown the
two Governments to lx at variance upon
both these topics- A disposition towards a
friendly agreement is manifested by the re
cognition of our right to an indemnity
for the transactions at Fortune Bay,
leaving the measures of such
indemnity to further conference, and by an
assent to the views of this government prcvsen
ted in previous correspondence that the regu
lation of conflict interests of our fish
ermen should be made the subject
of conference and concurrent arrangement
between the two governments. I sincerely
hope that a basis may lx found for a Speedy
adjustment of the very serious divergence of
views of the interpretation of the fishery claus
es in the treaty of Washington, whieh as cor
respondeni-e between the two Governments
stood at the close of the last session of Con
gress. seemed irreconcilable.

American Industrial Exhibits.
Iu the important exhibition of arts and in
dustries whieh was held last year at Sydney,
New South Wales, as well as in that now in
progresvS ai Melltourne, the United States
have been efficiently and honorably repre
sented. The exhibitors from this country at
the former place received a large number of
awards in some of the most considerable de
partments, and the î*articipat ion of the United
States was recognized by special marks of
distinction. InourexhibitionatMelbournethe
share taken by our country is no less notable,
and an equal degree of success is confidently
expected.
Franco-American Claims Convention.
The state of peace and tranquility now
enjoyed by all the nations of the continent
of Europe has its favorable influence upon
onr commercial relations with them. We
have concluded and ratified a convention
with the French republic for the settlement
of claims of the citizens of either country
against the other. Under this convention a
commission, presided over by a distinguished
publicist appointed in pursuance of the re
quest of both nations by his Majesty the
Emperor of Brazil, has been organized and
has begun its sessions iu this city.
Industrial Congress.
A congress to consider means for the pnx

There is nothing of importance to poti i h

Turkey and Greece. •
During last summer several vessels belong
ing to the merchant marine of this eotmtrv,
sailing in neutral waters of the West Indies,
were tired at, boarded and searched by armed
cruisers of the Spanish (iovernment. The
circumstances, as reported, involve not only
private injury to the persons concerned, but
also seemed too little observant of t he friendly
relations existing for a century Ixtween this !
country and Spain. The wrong was brought '
to the attention of the Spanish government j
in a serious prot«ist and remonstraiux, an*l

ot

the matter is undergoing an investigation bv
the royal authorities with a view to such ex
planation or reparation as may lx called for
by the facts. The commission sitting in this
city for the ad judication of claims against the
government of Spain Ls I hope approaching
the termination of its labors. The claims
against the United States under the Florida
treaty with Spain were submitted to Con
gress for its action at the late session, and I
again invite your attention to this long stand
ing question with a view to final disposition
of the matter.
At the invitation of the Spanish govern
ment a conference has recently been held a»
the city of Madrid to consider the sub
ject of protection by foreign powers of the
native Moors in the empire of Morocco. The
Minister of the United States in Spain was
directed to take part in the deliberations of
this conference, the result of which is a con
vention signed on behalf of all the power
represented. The instrument will lx laid
before the Senate for its consideration. Th
Government of the United States has also
lost no opportunity to urge upon that of th»
Emperor of Morocco the necessity, iu ac
cordance with the humane and enlightened
spirit of the age, of putting an end to the
persecutions which have been so prevalent in
that country of persons of a faith other than
Moslem, and especially of the Hebrew resi
dents of Morocco.
The consular treaty concluded with Bel
gium is not yet officially promulgated, owing
to the alteration of a word in the text by the
Senate of the United States, which occasion
ed a delay and during which the time al
lowed for the ratification expired. The Sen
ate will be asked to extend the period for
the ratification.
The attempt to negotiate a treaty with
Denmark failc-d on account of an ob
jection by the Danish Government to th
usual course of providing that each nation
should pay the expenses of arrest of prisoner^
where extradition is asked.
Provisions were made by Congress at it
last session for the expense of a commission
which had been appointed to enter upon
negotiations with the Imperial Gov't of China
on subjects of great interest to the relation-,
of the two countries, enabled the Commis
sioners to proceed at once upon their mission.
The Imperial Government was prepared to
give prompt and respectful attention to tho
matters brought under negotiation, and thr
Conference proceeded with such rapidity and
progress that on the 17tli November last th*
two treaties were signed at I'ekin. One re
lating to the introduction of Chinese int..
this country.and one in relation to commerce.
Mr. Tresso. one of the Commissioners, is nov
on his way home, bringing with liim th -
treaties, and it Is expected they will be re
ceived in season to be laid lx To re the Senat*
early in January. Onr minister in Japan
has negotiated a Convent ion for reciprocal re
lief of shipwrecked seamen.
I take occasion to urge once more nixe
Congress the propriety of making provision
for the erection of suitable fireproof building
at the Japanese capital, for th*- use of Un
American Legation, and a court house aud
jail connected with it. The Japanese Go\
erament, with great generosity and courtesy,
has offered for this purpose an eligible pie<v
of land.
