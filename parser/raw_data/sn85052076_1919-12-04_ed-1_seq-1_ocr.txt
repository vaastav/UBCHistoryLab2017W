Dr. Rom Visit to Berea
Dr. Johnston Ross of the Union Theological Semin
ary of New York has spent four days in Berea, giving
four addresses to the Studentjs, and five to the Faculty.
Dr. Ross is a native of Inverness, at the north of
Scotland, and is one of the greatest of the imported
preachers who have come from the Old World to the
New in somewhat recent years.
Why should a man come from Scotland to America
and from New York to Berea to speak on matters of con
duct and religion? It is because some men are gifted
beyond others with the art of making such addresses '
profitable to-those who hear them. Of course, it is sup
posed that we go to church every Sunday to receive
benefits. It is a benefit to meet our neighbors and join
with them in song and prayer. Too often the sermon
is about matters which do not closely concern us and is
uninteresting, if not unprofitable.
But there are some men in whose hearts the truth
seems to burn. They are stirred up by the wonderful
facts of this universe and God's providence. They do
not repeat what they have heard somebody else tell but
burn to pour out the thoughts which have come to them
in their, prayer and in their Bible reading and in their
work for God's kingdom and their fellowmen. Such a
man is Dr. Ross. As soon as we had listened to him
for ten minutes we all felt that he was giving us ideas that
were precious. Many a indent discovered himself and
his place in God's plun while listening to these addiesses,
anJ all the' College workers felt their youth renewed
and their consecration freshened.
The Citizen will give reports of his addressesbut
ioreprtcui redly convey the life and fire, the heat
and light, that came to us who listened.

REASONS FOR KNOWINO THE
BIBLE
Ho began by saying that Iho
American Dlhlo Society requested
thai in as many places as possible
iJ;: uUoiiii'on of tlio pcoplo should
. be drawn; tftday JLo the nQ0d.fora
tft'r'knoWdgo of" tho Diblo and
gaid that; rspooially in Berea, which
was named after a town mado fam
ous by the single feat that iLs peo
ple were Biblo students, attention
should be drawn to the situation
whirh had devoloped in the Protes
tant church. Four hundred years
ago the Protestant church choso tho
Bible as the scat of authority, and
organized religion around it Now,
religion had not always been organ
ized around a book. Quite excellent
people, like Abraham, had contrived
to bo religious without tho Diblo or
prayer meeting. The Romans or
ganized religion around a stale; tho
Jews around a (emplo nnd an altar;
and the Catholic church around the
mas. In these systems it was not
essential that any particular book
should bo widely known, but Pro
testantism has chosen to make the
liook central. Ignoranco of tho book
among Protestants, therefore, is
morn fatal than elsewhere, and in
our eities the situation is that,
though there is a Iliblo on tho pul
pil, there nro practically no Bibles
in the pews, nnd largo and Impor
tant sections of tho Bible simply
eannot bo taught from tho pulpit
because Iho p'eoplo havo no means
of referring to tho loxlbook. This
exclusion of the niblo from tho
churches, along with tho oxoluslon
of the Biblo from tho schools, make
n situation extremely perilous, nnd
yet it is tho situation which the
Berea students are going out to
face. Mr. Ross then commended tho

Addresses
study of Iho Bjblo from two points
of view.
I. Language
Recalling tho fact that our King
James' version was printed in 1011,
and thai Shakespeare died in 1010,
Iho speaker remindod his hearers
that probably these two literatures,
Ihe Bible and Shakespeare, have,
more than anything else, framed our
English iongue, and. jyhosoevcr
wishes to spoak English cleanly and
sweetly, should bo familiar with
i both. In connection with tho Bible,
the speaker said there was a moral
iRspccl-lo-llffr-mnUer-of-clean-Tind
'accurate speech. When Mattljow
Arnold died, the Itisliop of Ox lord,
, in his funeral sermon, declared that
; Mr. Arnold, by writing so beauli
fully in English, had rendered tho
people a moral as well as a linguis
tic service; because, said tho Bis
hop, many harsh and cruel things
would remain unsaid if men waited
to say them in good English. Tho
war brought about n certain debase
ment of linguistic currency. The
mouths of officers and soldiers and
of the common people had been do
tllcd, and it is necessary for us as
part of our moral servlco lo tho cur
rent generation to recover tho ca
pacity for good, clean, accurate, and
melodious speaking. Wo cannot do
better in this than to imitate Mr.
Ruskin, who said that, having
learned by heart largo portions of
the Bible, it was impossible for him,
even in tho foolishest days of youth,
to wrilo superficial or formal Eng
lish. II. Contents
Passing In tho contents of tho
Scriptures, the speaker pointed out
thai, although It took two thousand
years to put these books together
nnd their authorship is for the most
pari anonymous, the library as a
, whole for the Biblo is not a book
I but a shelf of books is marked by
I one feature from end to end. It
maintains that behind the things wo
see there is a Ood who cares for"
men a difficult but ennobling bo
lief. Now, tills truth the Biblo does
not present in a doctrinal proposl
tional wny, but in tho following
Ihreo wnys:
(I) A small section Is cut out of
human history nnd Is written (for
Iho most part rewritten from earlior
documents) from tho point of view
of showing that thero is n Ood who
enres. Ood is shown at every pos
sible stage as intruding into human
affairs. No narrative or story is
given for its own sake. All Is writ
ton with a bias, and In tho Interest
of this truth about Ood.
(2) Tho presenco of a Ood who
loves and cares for men produces
cortain reactions of tho human
heart both pious and impious, both
welcoming nnd resentful. Now, tho
Biblo gives us In books liko tho
Psalms and Job speolmens of these
human rencllons, and gives them
frankly, both tho pious and tho Im
pious onos. If somo of tho Blblo's,

An enlarged program for rural

Fight the Unrest
At this point the President mado
his most extensive reference to tho
peace treaty by saying the common
for the unrest "were superficial
rather Hian deep senled" and that
they "arise from or are connected
with the failure on. tho part of our
government to arrive speedily at a
just anil permanent peace permit
ting return to normal conditions,
from the transfusion of radical
theories' from seething Europear
centers pending aurh tln'ny. and

Tho future of the Pcaco Treaty Is
In doubt. President Wilson has thus
far refused lo discuss tho mailer for
publication, but II is expected that
ho will outline somo plan In his mes
sage to Congress, which is to converts
in a few days. Senator Lodge Is as
much opposed to compromlso as the
President, nnd wishes to mako a
party issue of the matter.
Tho Prime Minister of Italy, NUU,
hns mado an appeal to the people of
America to aid Italy in the difficult
problem of tho Adriatic ports. This
is rather n peculiar mclhod of pro
cedure, but it is quite apparent that
there is fear- of revolution in Italy,
unloss the matter is settled soon. It
is difficult to see what tho American
people can do, especially as wo are
not now a signatory to the Treaty
of Peace.
The Treaty of Pcaco is to go into
effect December 1st, regardless of
the action of (ho United Stales.
Germany, however, has been In
clined to take advantage of tho situ
ation and postpone the dato until
tho reiisscmblying of tho Senate
that it may bo known what that
i body is disposed finally lo do. Tho
j League of Nations will also bo set
I in motion, and it is possible that
President Wilson may be asked to
preside over the first sitting, oven
though our country has no voice in
its proceedings.
Iteports are current that there is
some possibility of the Sovlot Gov

confident that the Soviet form of
government is now able to triumph,
and that it could be made legal by
the approval of an assembly. Per
haps he is yielding lo conservative
influence.

It is probable that the United States

This may become a parly issue In

The House of Commons in Eng
land has abandoned tho policy of
unemployment pensions which was
an outcome of war conditions. A
phrase used in this connection sug
gests that il is the duty of the peo
ple lo support tho government and
not the duty of tho government to
support tho people. There is a sign
of reaction against socialistic tend
encies in that phrase that is worthy
