has been delivered to congress. Open- J
lng with a plea for the co-operation of
all classes In continuing the country's ;
prosperity and In correcting existing
evils, for a "square deal" for every
body, the message first takes up the
question of corporations and railroad
rate legislation. The president says:
Corporations.
I am in no sense hostile to corpora
tions. This Is an age of combination,
and any effort to prevent all combina
tion will be not only useless, but In the
end vicious, because of the contempt
for law which the failure to enforce
law Inevitably produces. The corpora-j
tion has come to stay. Just as the
trades union has come to stay. Each
can do and has done great good. Each
should be favored so long as It does
good. But each should be sharply
checked where it acts against law and
justice. j
Experience has shown conclusively
that it Is useless to try to get any ade
quate regulation and supervision of
these great corporations by state ac-
tion. Such regulation and supervision '
can only be effectively exercised by a
sovereign whose Jurisdiction Is coex
tensive wiih the field work of the cor
Ioratlons that Is, by the national gov
ernment. I believe that this regulation
and supervision can be obtained by the
enactment of law by the congress. If
this proves Impossible, It will certainly
be necessary ultimately to confer in t
fullest , form such power upon the na
tional government by affirmative ac
xnent of the constitution. j
The laws of the congress and of the '
several states hitherto, as passed upon 1
by the courts, have resulted more often j
in showing that the states have no
power In the matter than that the na
tional government has power; so that
there at present exists a very unfortu
nate condition of thincrs. under which
these great corporations doing an In- j
terstate business occupy the position or
subjects without a sovereign, neither
any state government nor the national
government ha ring effective control
over them. Our steady aim should be
by legislation, cautiously and carefully
undertaken, but resolutely persevered
in. to assert the sovereignty of the na
tional government by affirmative ac
tion. This la only In 'form an Innovation.
Ia substance it is merely a restoration,
for from the earliest time such regula
tion of industrial activities has been
recognized In the action of the law
making bodies, and all that I propose
is to meet the changed conditions la
such manner as will prevent the. com
monwealth abdicating the power It has
always possessed, not only in this coun
try, but also In England before and
since this country became a separate
nation.
Railroad Rate LsllatIon.
As I said In my message of Dec. C
last, the Immedrate and most pressing
need so far as legislation is concerned
is the enactment into law of some
scheme to semre to the agents of the
government such supervision and regu
lation of the rates charged by the rail
roads of the country engaged in Inter
state traffic as shall summarily and ef
fectively prevent the imposition of un
just or unreasonable rates. It must
include putting a' complete stop to re
bates in every shape and form. This
power to regulate rates, like all similar
powe- s over the business world, should
be exercised with moderation, caution
and self restraint, but it should exist,
so that it can be effectively exercised
when the need arises.
In my judgment, the most important
provision which such liw should con
tain is that conferring upon some com
petent administrative tody the power
to decide upon the case being brought
before it whether a given rate pre
scribed by a railroad is reasonable and
Just, and if it la found to be unreason
able and unjust then, after full investi
gation of the complaint, to prescribe
the limit of rate beyond which it shall
not be lawful to go the maximum
reasonable rate, as it is commonly call
edthis decision to go into effect with
in a reasonable time and to obtain
from thence onward, subject to review
by the courts.
It sometimes happens at present, not
that a rate is too high, but that a fa
vored shipper is given too low a rate.
In such case the commission would
have the right to fix this already-estab
lished minimum rate as the maximum,
and it would need only one or two such
decisions by the commission to core
railroad companies of the practice of
Tivmg improper minimum rates. I call
your attention to the fact that my pro
posal Is not to give the commission
rower to Initiate or originate rates gen
erally, but to regulate a rate already
fixed or originated by the roads epen
ccmplaint and tfier .fciTcrtlcstlra. A

commission or some similar body Jso
far as rates and agreements practical
ly affecting rates are concerned. A re
bate In icing charges or in mileage or la
. division of the rate for refrigerating
charges is Just as pernicious as a re
bate In any other way.
There should be publicity of the ac
counts of common carriers. Only In
this way can violations or evasions of
the law be surely detected. A System
of examination of railroad accounts
should be provided similar tor that now
conducted Into the national banks by
the bank examiners. A few first class
railroad accountants, if they had prop
er direction and proper authority to In
spect books and papers, could accom
plish much in preventing willful viola tions
of the law.
Employers' Llabrjfty Law.
In my annual message to the Fifty
eighth congress at its second session I
recommended the passage of an em
ployers' liability law for the District of
Columbia and In our navy yards. I re
newed that recommendation in my
message to the Fifty-eighth congress at
its second session and further suggest
ed the appointment of a commission to
make a comprehensive study of em
ployers liability with a view to the en
actment of a wise and constitutional
law covering the subject, applicable to
all industries within the scope of the
federal power. I hope that such a law
will be prepared and enacted as speed
ily as possible.
There has been demand for depriving
courts of the power to Issue Injunctions
in labor disputes. Such special limita
tion of the equity powers of our courts
would be most unwise. It is true that
some Judges have misused this power,
but this does not Justify a denial of the
power any more than an improper ex
ercise of the power to call a strike" by a
labor leader would justify the denial of
the right to strike. The remedy is to
regulate the procedure by requiring the
Judge to gtvedue notice to the adverse
parties before granting the writ, the
hearing to be ex parte If the adverse
party does not appear at the time and
place ordered. What is due notice must
depend upon the facts of the case. It
should not be used as a pretext to per
mit violation of law or the Jeopardiz
ing of life or property. Of course this
would not authorize the issuing of a
restraining order or Injunction in any
case in which it Is not already author
ized by existing law.
I renew the recommendation I made
In my last annual message for an in
vestigation by the department of com
merce and labor of general labor condi
tions, especial attention to bo paid to
the conditions of child labor and child
lalor legislation in the several states.
Such an investigation should take into
account the various problems with
which the question of child 'labor 13
connected. In such a republic as ours
the one thing that we cannot afford to
neglect Is the problem of .turning out
decent citizens. The future of the na
tion depends upon the citizenship of
the generations to come. The children
of today are those who tomorrow will
shape the destiny of our land, and we
cannot afford to neglect them. The leg
islature cf Colorado has recommended
that the national government provide
some general measure for the protec
tion from abuse of children and dumb
animals throughout the United States.
I lay the matter before you for what I
trusfwill be your favorable consider
ation. As 0 Women Who Work.
The department of commerce and la
bor should also make a thorough Inves
tigation of the conditions f women in
industry. Over 5,000,000 American wo
men are now engaged In gainful occu
pations, yet there is an almost completo
dearth of data upon which to base any
trustworthy conclusions as regards a
subject as important as It is vast and
complicated. The introduction' of wo
men into Industry Is working change
and disturbance in the domestic and
Eocial life of the nation. The decrease
it marriage! and especially in the birth
rr.te, has been coincident with it. We
rr.ust face accomplished facts, and the
adjustment to factory conditions must
bt made, but surely it can be made
with less friction and less harmful ef
fects on family life than is now the
case. This whole matter In reality
forms, one of the greatest sociological
phenomena of our time. It is a social
question of tho first importance, of far
greater importance than any merely po
litical or economic question can be.
In any great labor disturbance not
only are employer and employee inter
ested, but also a third party the gen
eral public. Every considerable labor
difflcultyMn which interstate commerce
is Involved should be investigated by
the government and the facts officially
reported to the public. "
Insurance.
The great insurance companies afford
striking examples of corporations
whose business has extended so far
beyond the Jurisdiction of the states
which created them as to preclude
strict enforcement of supervision and
regulation by the parent states. In my
last annual message I recommended
"that the congress carefully consider
whether the power of the bureau of
corporations cannot constitutionally be
extended to cover interstate transac
tions in Insurance." Recent events
have emphasized the importance of an
early and exhaustive consideration of
this question, to see whether it is not
possible to furnish better safeguards
than the several states have been able
to 'furnish against corruption 'of the
flagrant kind which has been exposed.
It has been only too -clearly shown
that certain of the men at ths bead cf
these large corporations take but small
note of the ethical distinction between

adequate national supervision "of com
mercial Interests which are clearly na
tional in character.
I repeat my previous recommenda
tion that the congress should consider
whether the federal government has
any power or owes any duty with re
spect to domestic transactions In In
surance of an interstate character.
That state supervision has proved In
adequate Is generally conceded.
Tin RYas)sa.
There is more need of stability than
of the attempt to attain an ideal per
fection In the methods of raising rev
enue, and the shock and strain to the
business world certain to attend any
serious change In these methods ren
der such change Inadvisable unless for
grave reason. It Is not possible to lay
down any general rule by, which to de
termine the moment when the reasons
for will outweigh the reasons against
such a change. No change can be
made on lines beneficial to or desired
by one section or one state only. There
must be something like a general agree
ment among the citizens of the several
states that the change Is needed and
desired in the interest of the people as a
whole, and there should then be a sin
cere, Intelligent and disinterested ef
fort to make It In such shape as will
combine, so far as possible, the maxi
mum of good to the people at large
with the minimum of necessary disre
gard for the special Interests of locali
ties or classes, but in-time of peace
the revenue must, on the average,
taking a series of years together, equal
the expenditures or else the revenues
must be Increased. Last year there
was a deficit. Unless our expenditures
can be kept within the revenue. then
our revenue laws must be readjued.
It Is impossible to outline what ßhape
such a readjustment should take, for
it is as yet too early to say whether
there will be need for it. It should be
considered whether It Is not. desirable
that the tariff laws should provide for
applying as against or In favor of any
other nation maximum and minimum
tariff rates established by the congress,
so as to secure a certain reciprocity of
treatment between other nations and
ourselves.
Economy In Expenditures.
I earnestly recommend to the con
gress the need of economy and, to this
end, of a ii:d scrutiny of appropria
tions. AH unnecessary offices should
be abolished. In the public printing
also a large saving of money can be
made. There Is a constantly growing
tendency to publish masses of unim
portant Information at which no human
being ever looks.
Yet, In speaking of economy, I must
in nowise be understood as advocating
the false economy which Is in the end
the worst extravagance. To cut down
In the navy would be a crime against
the nation. To fall to push forward all
work on the Tana ma canal would bo
as great a folly.
Currency.
Every consideration of prudence de
mands the addition of the element of
elasticity to our currency system. The
evil does not consist in an Inadequate
volume of money, but In the rigidity
of this volume, which does not respond
as it should to the varying needs of
communities and of seasons. Inflation
must be avoided, but some provision
should be made that will Insure a
larger volume of money during the fall
and winter months than In the less ac
tive seasons of the year, so that the
currency will contract against specula
tion and will expand for the needs of
legitimate business. ,At present the
treasury department is at Irregularly
recurring Intervals obliged In the inter
est of the business world that Is, In
the Interests of the American public
to try to avert financial crises by pro
viding a. remedy which should be pro
vided by congressional action.
TtaiilnefiM Methods In Departments.
At various times I have Instituted In
vestigations into tho organization and
conduct of tho business of the execu
tive departments. While none of these
inquiries have yet progressed far
enough to warrant final conclusions,
they have already confirmed and em
phasized the general Impression that
the organization of the departments Is
often faulty in principle and wasteful
In results, while many of their business
methods are antiquated and Inefficient,
I recommend that the congress consider
this subject. ' r
Federal Elections.
In my last annual message I said:
'The power of the government to
protect the Integrity of the elections of
its own officials is Inherent and has
been recognized and affirmed by re
peated declarations of the supreme
court. There is no enemy of free gqy-
Insidious as the corruption of the elect
orate. No one defends or excuses cor
ruption, and it would seem to follow
that none would oppose vigorous meas
ures to eradicate it I recommend the
enactment of a law directed against
bribery and corruption in federal elec
tions. The details of such a law may
be safely left Jo the wise discretion of
the congress, but it should go as far as
under the constitution It is possible to
go and should include severe penalties
against him who gives or receives a
bribe Intended to influence his act or
opinion as an elector and provisions for
the publication not only of the expend
itures for nominations and elections of
all candidates, but also of all contribu
tions received and expenditures made
by political committees."
I desire to repeat this recommenda
tion. : ; 5 '

yal forces. In October, 1004, "at the In
stance of the interparliamentary anion,
I issued Invitations to all the powers
signatory to The Hague convention to
send delegates to such a ' conference
and suggested that It be again held at
Tbi Hague.
- Prom all the powers acceptance was
received, coupled In some cases with
the condition that we should wait until
the end of the war then waging be-"
tween Russia and Japan. The emperor
of Russia, immediately after the treaty
of peace which so happily terminated,
this war. In a note presented to the
president on Sept. 13 took the Initiative
in recommending that the conference
be now called. The United States gov
ernment in response expressed its cor
dial acquiescence and stated that It
would as a matter of course ta!ie part
in the new conference and endeavor to
further Its alms. We assume that all
civilized governments will support the
movement and that the conference is
now an assured fact. This government
will do everything In its power to se
cure the success of the conference to
the end that substantial progress may
be made In the cause of International
peace. Justice and good will.
Monroe Doctrine.
There are certain essential points
which must never be forgotten as re
gards the Monroe doctrine. In the first
place, we must as a nation make it ev
ident that we do not intend to treat It
in any shape or way as an excuse for
aggrandizement on our part at the ex
pense of the republics to tho south.
Cut we must make it evident that we
do not intend to permit the Monroe doc
trine to be used by ?.ny nation on this
continent as a shield to protect It from
tho consequences of its own misdaeds
against foreign nations. The Monroe
doctrine does not force us to Interfere
to prevent the punishment of a port
save to see that tho punishment does
not assume the form of territorial occu
pation in any shape. The ease is more
difficult when It refers to a contractual
obligation. This country would cer
tainly decline to go to war to prevent a
foreign government from collecting a
just debt. On the other hand, it Is
very inadvisable to permit any foreign
power to take possession, even tempo
rarily, of the custom houses of an
American republic in order to enforce
the paj-ment of its obligations, for such
temporary occupation might turn Into
a permanent occupation. The only es
cape from these alternatives may at
any time be that we must ourselves
undei'take to bring alout some arrange
ment by which so much as possible of
a just obligation shall be paid.
To do so insures the defaulting re
public from having to pay debti of an
improper character under duress, while
it ."also Insures honest creditors ot the
republic from being passed by in the
interest of dishonest or grasping cred
itors. - Moreover; for the United States
to take such a position offers the only
posslblo way of insuring us against a
clash with some foreign power. Tho
position 13 therefore in the Interest of
peace as well as in the interest of Jus
tice. Santo Domingo.
Santo Domingo has now made an ap
peal to us, and not only every principle
of wisdom, but every generous Instinct
within us, bids us respond to the. ap
peal. The conditions In Santo Domingo
have for a number of years grown
from bad to worse until a year ago all
society was on the verge of dissolution.
Fortunately Just at this time a ruler
sprang up In Santo Domingo who, with
his colleagues, saw the dangers threat
ening their country and appealed to the
friendship of the only neighbor who
possessed the power and the will to
help them. There was imminent dan
ger of foreign . Intervention. The pa
tience of foreign creditors had become
exhausted, and at least two foreign na
tions were on the point of intervention
and were only prevented by the unoffi
cial assurance of this government that
It would itself strive to he!p Santo
Dor lingo In her hour of need.
Accordingly, the executive depart
ment of bur government negotiated a
treaty under which we are trying to
help the Dominican people to straight
en out their finances. This treaty is
pending before the senate. In the
meantime a temporary arrangement
has been made under which the Domin
ican government has appointed Amer
icans to all the Important positions in
the customs service, and they are see
ing to the honest collection of the rev
enues, turning over 13 per cent to the
government for running expenses and
putting the other 55 per cent Into a
safe depositary for editable division
in case the treaty shall be ratified
among the various creditors, whether
European or American.
Under the course taken stability and
order end all the benefits of peace aro
at last coming to Santo Domingo, dan
ger of foreign intervention has been
suspended, and there Is at last a pros
pect that all creditors will get Justice,
no more and no loss. If the arrange
ment is terminated by the failure of
tTie treaty chaos will follow, and sooner
or later this government may be in
volved In serious 'difllculties with for
eign governments over the Island or
else may be forced Itself to intervene
in the Island in some unpleasant fash
ion. .
Army and Narr.
I do not believe that any army In the
world has a better average of enlisted
man or a better type of Junior officer,
but the army should be trained to act
effectively in a mass. Trovislon should
be . made by sufficient appropriations
for maneuvers of a practical kind.

has now reached a fairly high standard
of efficiency. This standard must not
only be maintained, but increased. It
does not seem to me necessary, how
ever, that the navy should, at least in
the immediate future, be Increased be
yond the present number of units.
What is now clearly necessary Is to
substitute efficient for Inefficient units
as the latter become worn out or as it
becomes apparent that they are use
less. Probably the result would be
attained by adding a single battleship
to our nary each year, the superseded

Hataimllaatlom.
On this subject I recommend:
First A. federal bureau of naturali
zation, to be established in the depart
ment of commerce and labor, to su
pervise the administration of the natu
ralization laws and to receive returns
of naturalizations pending and accom
plished. Second. Uniformity of naturalization
certificates, fees to be charged, and
procedure.
Third. More exacting Qualifications
for citizenship.
Fourth. The preliminary declaration
of Intention to be abolished and no
alien to be naturalized until at least
ninety days after the filing of his peti
tion.
Fifth. Jurisdiction to naturallzo
aliens to be confined to United States
district courts and to 6uch state courts
as have Jurisdiction in civil actions in
which the amount In controversy is un
limited; in cities of over 100,000 Inhab
itants the United States district courts
to have exclusive Jurisdiction in the
naturalization of the alien residents of
such cities.
Criminal Lam,
In my last message I asked the at
tention of the congress to the urgent
need of action to mako our criminal
law more effective, and I most ear
nestly request that you pay heed to
the report of the attorney general on
this subject.
There seems to be no statute of the
United States which provides for the
punishment of a United States attor
ney or other officer of the government
who corruptly agrees to wrongfully do
or wrongfully refrain from doing any
act when- the consideration for such
corrupt agreement is other than one
possessing money value. This ought to
be remedied by appropriate legislation.
Legislation should also be enacted to
cover explicitly, unequivocally and be
yond question breach of trust in tho
shape cf prematurely divulging official
secrets by an officer or employee of the
United States and to provide a suitable
penalty therefor. , '
Merchant Marine.
To the spread of our trade in peace
and the defense of our flag In war a
great and prosperous merchant marine
is Indispensable. "We should have ships
of our own and seamen of our own to
convey our goods to neutral markets
and In case of need to re-enforce our
battle line. It cannot but be a source
of regret and uneasiness to us that the
lines of communlcaUon with our sister
republics of South America should be
chiefly under foreign control. It Is not
a good thing that American merchants
and manufacturers should have to send
their goods and letters to South Amer
ica via Europe if they wish security
and dispatch. Even on the Taclflc,
where our ships have held their own
better than on the Atlantic, our mer
chant flag is now threatened through
the liberal aid bestowed by other gov
ernments on their own steam lines. I
ask your, earnest consideration of the
report with which ,the merchant ma
rine commission has followed Its long
and careful inquiry.
- It U a matter of. unmixed satisfac
tion once more to call attention to the
excellent work of the pension bureau,
for the veterans of the civil war have
a greater claim lipon us than any other
class of our citizens. To them first of
all among our people honor is due.
Immigration.
As I said in my last message to the
congress, we cannot have too much
Immigration of the right sort, and we
should have none whatever of the
wrong sort.
Tho questions arising in connection
with Chinese Immigration stand by
themselves. The conditions In China
are such that the entire Chinese cooly
class that -Is, the class of Chinese la
borers, skilled and unskilled legiti
mately come under the head of unde
sirable Immigrants to this country.
But in the effort to carry out the pol
icy ,of excluding Chinese laborers, Chi
nese coolies, grave injustice and wrong
have been done by this 'nation to. the
people of China and therefore ultimate
ly to this nation itself. Chinese stu
dents, business and professional men
of all kinds, not only merchants, but
bankers, doctors,, manufacturers, pro
fessors, travelers and the like, should
be encouraged to come here and treat
ed on precisely the same footing that
we treat students, business men, trav
elers and the like of other nations.
As a people we- have talked much of
the open door in China, and , we expect,
and quite rightly intend to insist upon.
Justice being shown us by the Chinese.
But we cannot expect to receive equity
unless we do equity.
The Civil Service.
Ileads of executive departments and
members of the commission have call
ed my attention to the fact that the
rule requiring a filing of charges and
three days' notice before an employee
could ho sens rated from the service for
meSclency has served no good pur
pose whatever. Experience baa shown
that the rule Is wholly Ineffective to

from the series of disasters wnich since
American occupation have greatly re
duced the amount of agricultural prod
ucts below what was produced in Span
ish times.
The agricultural conditions of the Is
lands enforce more strongly than ever
the argument in favor of reducing the
tariff on the products of the Philippine
Islands entering the United States. I
earnestly recommend that the tariff
now imposed by the Dingley bill upon
the products of the Philippine Islands
be entirely removed, except the tariff
on sugar and tobacco, and that that
tariff be reduced to 23 per cent of the
present rates under the Dingley act;
that after Ju?y 1, 1909, the tariff upon
tobacco and sugar produced In the
Philippine Islands be entirely removed
and that free trade between the Islands
and the United States in the products
of each country then be provided for
by law.
In my judgment. Immediate steps
should be taken for the fortification of
Ilawall. This is the most Important
point in the Pacific to fortify In order
to conserve the Interests of this' coun
try. It would be hard to overstate the
Importance of this need. Ilawali Is too
heavily taxed. Laws should be enact
ed setting aside for a period of, say,
twenty years 73 per cent of the internal
revenue and customs receipts from Ha
waii ns a special fund to be experlded
in the islands.
I earnestly advocate the adoption of
- legislation which will explicitly confer
American citizenship on all citizens of
Porto Rico.
I wish also to call the attention of;
tho congress to one question which af
fects our Insular possessions generally
namely, the nevnl of an increased lib
erality in the treatment of the whole
franchise question in these islands.
I earnestly ask that Alaska be given
an elective delegate.
AdmlHftlon to Statehood.
I recommend that Indian Territory
and Oklahoma be admitted a3 one stato
and that Xew Mexico and Arizona be
admitted us one state.
The Panama Canal.
Active work in canal construction,
mainly preparatory, has been lu prog
ress for less than a year and a half.
During that period two points about
the canal have ceased to bo open to
debate. Crst tho question of route;
second, tho question of feasibility. Tho
point which remains unsettled Is wheth
er the canal shall be one of several
locks above sea level or at ea level
with a single tide lock. On this point
I hope to lay before the congress at an
early day the findings of the advisory
board of American and European en
gineers. In addition to sanitating the isthmus,
satisfactory quarters are being provid
ed for employees and an adequate sys
tem of supplying them with wholesome
food at reasonable prices has been cre
ated. Hospitals have been established
and equipped that are without superi
ors pf their kind anywhere. During
the past year a large portion of the
plant with which the work Is to be
done has been ordered. It is confident-
iy believed that by the middle of the
approaching year a sufficient propor
tion' of this plant will have been In-
Stalled to enable us to resume the work
of excavation on a large scale.
What is needed now and without de
lay is an appropriation by the congress
to meet the current and accruing ex
penses of the commission. The first
appropriation of $10,000,000 o;t of the
$135,000,000 authorized by the Spooner
act was made three years ago. It is
nearly exhausted. Unless the congress
shall appropriate before tint time all
work must cease.
In conclusion the president recom
mends an Increase in the diplomatic
and consular service and more ad
equate compensation of its members.
