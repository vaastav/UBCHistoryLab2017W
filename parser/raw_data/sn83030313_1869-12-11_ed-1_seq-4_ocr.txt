Our It nil roads and Telegraph* and the Gov
ernment? The Next (ireat Question.
General Butler, we think, has made a safe
prediction in reference to the railroads and
telegraphs of the United States. We refer to
his remarks on the subject in tho debate in the
House of Representatives the other day on the
Census bill?to wit, that "lie wanted to know
the statistics of railroad transportation, of the
express business and of tho telegraph business,
because he looked forward to the time within
the next ten years when tho country would
have to grapple with those great interests and
take control of them."
Upon this point we havo not the shadow of
a doubt. Tho country will "have to grapple
with thoso great interests and take control of
them." Southern reconstruction and the negro
question in all its phases are substantially set
tled. The woman's rights agitation, from
present appearances, will be limited to our
fanatical moral and social reformers of the
New England school for many years to come.
The great money quostion, in all its divisions
of debt, bonds, banks, taxation, currency,
&c., is the great question of the day, upon
which, however, wo apprehend the line of
discussion and Congressional action till next
winter has been marked out in the President's
Message. Wo are also of tho opinion that
under tho practical policy laid down by the
President there will be no violent perturba
tions in our financial system or business affairs
under Grant's administration; but that, with
his careful and judicious guidance, tho govern
ment and the country will work their way
steadily and without any serious disturbance
through the wilderness of Arabia and around
the southern end of tho Dead Sea to tho Pro- |
misod Land of a restoration ol' specie paymonU
and tho removal of ouy heavy burden of taxes
and debt." The Israelites had all thoir fighting
to do after their escape from the slavery of
Egypt; we hud to do our fighting in making
our escape, and in the passage of the Red Sea
of our great rebellion; and even now the ad
vanced guard of tho congregation havo entered
the new inheritance of "equal rights," rich in
cotton, corn, petroleum, coal, iron, gold and
silver, and "flowing with milk and honey."
With this inspiring and glorious prospect on
the money question, and having substantially
settled tho reconstruction question and tho
negro question, and regarding tho woman's
rights question as only a convenient tub to
tho whale of New England fanaticism for tho
present, what will be the next great question
awakening a general political agitation ? Some
say it will be the " irrepressible conflict" which
is looming up between capital and labor?that
the trades unions of tho country are drifting to
a general alliance as a political party, and that,
having the votes, they have only to combine in
order to achieve a greater political revolution
in behalf of the rights of labor than was ever
dreamed of by the most radical of modern re
formers. But as tho formation of such a party
is necessarily a work of time, its consideration
may be dismissed for the present, in view of
tho more rapidly approaching and nearer
issues before us. Conspicuous among these is
the issue at hand between the railway and
telegraph corporations on the one side, and
the people on tho other side.
The Camden and Amboy Railroad monopoly
tells an in-.tructivo story for New Jersey; tho
Baltimore anil Ohio monopoly tells a similar
story for Maryland and tho national capital,
und r which even tho Congress of the United
States for a generation or two has been pay
ing a provincial tribute to tho Caisar of a
railway corporation. The State of Illinois,
under a special railway grant of the public
lands from Congress, lias been put under the
government of tho ''Illinois Central," which
can say to tho Legislature, "Thus far shalt
thou go and no farther," and be obeyed. Hi re
in New York a patient though sorely per
plexed people are anxiously awaiting the
upohot of tho "Erio war," but with some
expectations that it will end in the complete
occupation of tho State by Cornelim Vander
bilt or his successor in office. And bo we
have, or aro promised, in every State a rail
way monopoly which may establish Its own
rules and regulations by buying up or tying
up courts, Legislatures and political parties.
So in the Western Union Telegraph Com
pany we have tho nucleus upon which may bo
established, and which will be unless arrested
by Congress, a monopoly which over the news
paper press of both parties may wield the
balance of power in our political ('lections,
and over the money market, wbilo cm idling
itself and extending its powi r in extortionate
tribute from tho press, th<5 government and
the people. We have repeatedly shown the
admirable workings of the telegraph in Europo
under government control, in the responsible
and reliable system, and in tho cheap rates for
tho transmission of despatch"* thus estab
lished. We havo shown that the telegraph
properly belongs to the sphere of the Post
Office Department, and that as an independent
concern, while it results In offensive exactious
upon the proa* and the general business inteN
osts of the country, it Is, in reducing the
revenuos of the General Post Office, steadily
contributing to swell the expenses of the
Treasury and the taxes upon the people.
Under the constitution Congress has "tho
power to establish post offices and post roads,"
the power to rogulate commerce among the
States, to lay and oollect taxes, and to make
all laws necessary to carry these powers into
execution, which amply embrace the power to
tako possession of the whole telegraph system
of the United States as properly belonging to
tho Post Office Department, and the power to
regulate all the railroad linos of the country.
The necessity for the exercise of those powers
is already sufficiently apparont for action. We
see that under an overshadowing telograph
corporation there can bo no such thing in this
country as freedom of the press. In tho matter
of news it can only be free to the extent to
which it may bo ablo here and there to act in
defiance of such telegraph corporation. We
havo seen that a control of the telegraph is
nocessary to the government not only in war,
but, touching tho operations of Wull street,
necessary in times of peace. Givo a telegraph
monopoly tho chance, and upon the symptoms
of a financial panic it may swamp the Troasury.
Wo sco that our State courts and State Legis
latures can bo bought up or twisted to suit tho
purposes of dominant railway corporations,
and that tho only remedy lies in Congress.
Henco wo entirely agree with General Butler,
that the timo is near when the country will
have to grapple with those telegraph and
railway monopolies, and the sooner the bettor
it will bo for tho country and the Treasury.
l'lectlon Rvprnters?Wbnt la tho Itcinedy V
The extent to which "repeating" was carried
on In tho lato charter election is bearing its
fruit in a quarter hitherto considered inacces
sible to influences of this sort. Not only was
repeating resorted to, but the "stuffing" and
"counting out" processes were largely indulged
in, to the serious detriment, not of republican
adversaries, but of erst democratic friends
and eolaborers in tho old game. This, in
fact, makes what would bo under other cir
cumstances a trifling matter and of little con
sideration one of great consequence. It was
a game of democratic bluff; and the idea of
being bluffed and sold, when each party
thought they had the game in their own hands,
was too bad. There was evidently a screw
looso somewhere. Either tho one side had
miscalculated its opponent's resources, or had
not given it credit for boing prepared to go in
for repeaters to tho extent of securing a
victory. Tho fact is that political strategy was
nover moro deftly or successfully practised
than as between tho rival candidates of the
samo organization. Shoeing a troop of horse
with felt, after King Lear's idea, was a blun
dering strategy compared with that pursued in
soino of tho wards on Tuesday last by the rival
democratic opponents.
In one district, the most interesting of ail
tho fields of conflict, the repeaters held in
reserve for ono candidate were by a ruse
brought up to tho polls and recorded their :
votes for their employer's opponent. Here
was tho biter bitten with a vengeanco, and
bitter feud is the consequence.
In the up-town districts the confidence game
was very successfully practised. In one of tho
districts a defeated candidate asks that his op
ponent will be magnanimous enough to inform
him of the number of votos cast for him that
wero counted in the interest of his opponent,
pledging himself to take no action in the mat
ter. In another (the new district) the defeated
candidate for Folice Justice protests against
the action of the inspectors and canvassers,
confident that not only has ho suffered a de
feat through fraud, but that his supporters, the
majority of the voters of the district, have
been grossly cheated of their right of suffrage.
And so it is throughout all the districts and
wards of the city. Now, what is the remedy for
this most outrageous state of affairs? In what
way can the purity of tho ballot box bo re
stored and the electors of tho city assured
that thoir votes are honestly countcd and ap
propriately recorded for the candidates of their
choice? Only through legislation, not con
fined merely to measures passed at Albany,
but to legislation in Congress?a broad and
comprehensive scheme of legislation, embrac
ing the national points in the question and the
local ones with rcjard to tho political ma
chinery in tho city and State.
Tnis system of fraudulent voting is Increasing
iu our midst. The result, as seen in tho late
election, is pregnant with warning to the dom
inant party itself and to its partisans, and the
remedy, to be effectual, must Btriko at the very
root of the evil. Legislation is the first thing
necessary, and the citizens, if they value the
franchise?tho right and prerogative of free
men?will seo to it that when thoir representa
tives meet at Albany this question will be
taken up nnd effectually disposed of.
Tnit Ritblinuamb CuiNEoB Treaty.?This
instrument has been ratified by tho imperial
government in I'ekin nnd despatched in its
attested form by a special messenger to Wash
ington. This important intelligence reaches
us by a special cable tolegram, which we pub
lish to-day. In view of th# iutoreBt which
will attach to tho news wo republish
from tho IIebald file a copy of the
text of the treaty as it was signed tiy Mr. Bur
lingame and the Chinese Ministers and for
wurdod to us from Washington. The document
sets forth the mutual advantages which will
accrue to tho two nations?the most ancient
and youngest on tho glijbe?from its fruition
and fulfilment, and thus gives much promise of
a happy international future.
Thk Rki.eahk oir tub Spanish Gunhoatb.?
From the unconditional release of the Spanish
gunboats yesterday, it appears that tho original
ground far the libel is abandoned, in viow of
tho cessation of tho war botweon Spain and
I'ero, and it may also be inferrod that tho
administration Is not yet prepared fo endorse
Judge I'ierropont's discovery, in connection
with tho alleged object of theso gunboats to
relieve other Spanish vessels blockading Cuba,
that in our neutrality laws "a people" has the
same legai status as a "nation." If, however,
it had been endorsed by tho administration
that discovery mfght have boen the starting
point of such a new lino of American diplo
macy as would ultimately lead to radical
changes of international relations throughout
the world.
An .Error or Worse f
In a recent letter to the London Post Mr.
Ashbury, an English yaobtrnan, publishes the
following as an extract from the Nkw York
Herald of July 29, 18G9:?
It is Impossible to hido the root that England has
no yacht tuut could possibly compete with any hope
or success uiuuust the Dauntless across the At.an
tic, and notwithstanding nil the bounce that Is being
eaid and written about the Cambria, it is manliest
to every seaman that in an ocean race she would bo
no match whatever ugain*t the American yacht.
Kxcusos may be made, but they will be merely ex
cuses.
In the same letter he publishes the follow
ing as an extract from the Herald of the 31st
of the same month?
The challenge of the Dauntless to race the cham
pion English yacht, the Cambria, from C'owes to
New York, on tho 1st September next, will oiter a
lair opportunity (or judging whether the pluclc of
tue English yachtmen Is up to the occasion, or
whether they are willing to bo led behind 111 a manly
sport in which they have hitherto claimed to be
leaders. If their courage should rail them now their
Inland matches, channel races and little pleasure
trips within hailing distance or the shore will seem
lute child's play beside the achievements of Ameri
can yachts. The ract is the "swells" ol tho royal
yacht clubs of (treat Britain must make up their
minds to extend their pleasure excursions to the
Amoncan coast unless they are content to be styled
dry water yachtmen lor the rest or their days.
As Mr. Asiibury has been the boldest or British
yachtmen on paper, public expectation points to him
as the lilting pioneer in these new and more ex
tended contacts invited by American daring. Let us
hope that the zeal and coufldeucu he expressed a
few months ago wtil not have abated next Septem
ber.
Wo are only induced to notice those para
graphs frofo tho feeling that justice to ourselves
demands tho declaration that it is a false
charge to attributo these paragraphs to ub.
Whother they are frauds, through and through,
Bheer fabrications with a motive, we cannot
say, but they wore not extracted from the
Herald, and not a 3 ,'ntenco that resembles
them, or that could by any ingenuity bo
twisted into such shapes, appoars in tho papers
of the dates given. In neithor of the dates
ailegod does tho Herald discuss tho topics they
touch?they are spurious paragraphs. Wo
cannot divine what motivo Mr. Ashbury could
havo for putting in our mouth words that
would be in Btich bad taste, and that might so
justly bo offensive to English yachtmen.
France?Napoleon and the Radical*.'
French politics still command a large amount
of attention, although it cannot bo said that
the situation is at all well defined. For tho
first time in tho history of the second empire
freedom of spccch is onjoyed in tho Chambers.
Wo cannot say that freedom of speech has
been absolutely abused as yet, but it is not to
bo denied that liberty has been carried to the
verge of license. It was the opinion of some
that tho derisive cheors which the allusion to
Rochefort called forth on the occasion of tho
opening of the Chambers was proof sufficient
that Rochefort's game was played out. On
that day Rochefort was conspicuous by his
absence. So far as ho himself was concerned
his absonce was a wise and well considered
stroke of policy. Since the opening day tho
lampooner has been a faithful membor and his
seat has seldom been empty. Nor has he been
a dumb do^. True, ho has made no great
effort?and it is perhaps also true that great
effort is not in him?yet ho has on several
occasions opened his month, and if he has not
done anything nobler he has snarled, and
snarled to some purpose. If ho goes on as he
has begun it maybe necessary for the Emperor
in some way or other to shut him up. It was
a daring thing to say what ho said on Thurs
day, that tho Emperor gave the signal for the
members to laugh at him. A little more of
this and Franco must decide against M. Roche
fort or against the Emperor. It will not be
wonderful if another general election be soon
found necessary; and there are many who
will not feel surprised if the man of tho Lan
terne finds himself out in tho cold. It is still
uncertain who is to be the Emperor's Prime
Minister. For a time it socmed as if M. Ollivier
should be the maa. It does not appear, how
e,vor, that this most moderate of the oppo
sitionists has been at all successful in his
attempts to organizo a ministry. M. For
cade, the Minister of the Interior, is tho most
prominent man of tho hour on the Emperor's
side. It will not bo wonderful if he should
riso to a higher position. Meanwhile the
situation is ono of suspense and uncertainty.
Coal?Fair Prospects for the Consumers.
The statistics of the product and salo of coal
which we published yesterday bring cheerful
news to the consumers of that article, which,
we may add, means tho whole community, at
a time, too, when we ara entering upon a
winter, which, coining so early upon us as it
does, promises to be very severe. ThiB time
last yoar things wero comparatively fresh and
green. Tho Hudson was not frozen, as it is
now, above Poughkeepsie, and skating rinks
were only beginning to be thought about, yet
coal was looming up in prico, with a prospect
of fourteen or fifteen dollars a ton ahoad of us.
This year winter strikes us in tho beginning of
December, with three dreary months still
before us, ere the buds and blossoms come.
But, fortunately for the poor as woll as for those
whose circumstances coinpoi them to practice
economy, the coal dealers appear to havo over
reached themselves. The rue in coal last
October stimulated the dealers to put in a
large stock, expecting a still greater rise. In
Boston and Philadelphia, as well as in this
city,' thcro came a glut in tho coal yards. But
this very avaricious move on the part of the
traders?like in.iny others where avarice over
steps itself?only rosulted in bringing down
tho price. Tho supply just now exceeds tho
demand, and that regulatos tho quostion of
cheaper coal. Happily for tho public, extor
tion now becomes impossible, because compe
tition steps in to arrest it.
The statistics show that coal from the Penn
sylvania minea can be delivered at Elizabeth
port?our entrepot?at an average prico of
three dollars and a quarter per ton of 2,^40
pounds, whether delivered by railroad or canal.
The freight from that point to this city, we
need not say, is comparatively trifling, yet the
dealers even now, with a vast stock 011 hand,
demand ten dollars and over por ton for coal
of only two thousand pounds. Let no one
imagino that he ever gets more than two thou
sand, and if he gets that much ho is lucky.
In tho face of those facts, then, coal moat bo
greatly reducod in price botwoon tins a'id
spring. Tho jlualers will, of course, endoavor
to keep it up by every possible device and
excuse. Tho best way to defeat them is lor
families not to put in any more coal than is
necessary for immediate wants. Remember
that tho market is full and that slocks of coal
must bo sold between this timo and noxt
? April or the coal dealers will suffor terribly.
CoainM and the Haprene Court.
The foar that the Supreme Court, in pro
nouncing as to tbo rights of citizens of the
United States, may judge that some citizens
have more rights than it is agreeable to Con
gross to acknowledge, and that thereby tho
reconstruction laws may bo declared void
in certain points, has hitherto driven
Congress into soma very queer attitudes, but
into none moro ridiculous than the one it
assumes in tho bill to restrict the appellate
jurisdiction of tho Supreme Court, just reported
from the Senate Judiciary Committoo. The
objoct of this bill is to cover such cases as tho
Yergor case. Cliiof Justloe Chase, it will be
remembered, recontly decided that tho Su
preme Court must hoar tho appeal of Yerger,
who had been tried by a military oourt in an
unreconstructed State, and who claimed that
such a trial was in contravoution of his right,
under the constitution, to a trial by jury. lie
had been brought beforo tho United States
District Court on habeas corpus. That court
had judged the military trial valid. Hence
his appeal to the Supreme bench. It is obvious
that such a trial would compel tho Court to
determine that great vital point between the
constitution, which would givo this roan a trial
by jury, and a law of Congress which gives
him a trial only by military commission.
Congress knows that such a point cannot be
aafely ventured beforo a non-political body?
beforo a body that judges according to the law
rather than according to certain loose doc
trines of necessity. It, therefore, now de
clares that all such casus are political, and
utters Us declaration to tho judicial power
not to vonture on tho ground of politics. If
Congress had contented itself with the passage
oi a law distinctly defining these cases and
declaring that such appoals should not bo heard
by tho Supreme Court it would have done only
what is unquestionably in its power; but in
this warning in regard to politics it will bo
seen that it ventures a great deal more.
In this section, for instance, it appears to
be altogether out of its depth :?
Ho it enacted, Ac., That under the constitution the
Judicial power or the United States does not em
uraeo political power or irivo to the judicial tribunal
any authority to question the decision of the po
litical depart meats of the government on political
(incsilon"'; and it is hereby declared that all courts
of the United States In the administration of justice
shall be bound by the decision of tliu political uo
parimeuts of the government on political questions.
The constitution saya "the judicial power
shall extend to all cases, in law and equity,
arising tinder this constitution and tho laws of
the United States." Now, whenever a citizen
is deprived of his rights by any porson assum
ing to act under a law of Congress then a
"caso" has arisen that properly and necessa
rily brings that law of Congress under the
review of tho courts. It is the pequliar dis
covery of'republican politicians that certain
laws of Congress may be called political, In
contradistinction from other laws, and that in
virtue of that namo tlicy are exempt from judi
cial examination. Whilo wo may admit as an
abstraction that Congress is tho depository of
political power, we may safely defy any one to
show how that power has any existence save
in its application?that is, cxcept ?as it is
applied to persons; and when it is applied to
persons in Btich a manner as to oppress them
and to infringe their rights then surely we
have a case that calls for such remedy as the
courts can give, tho metaphysical hairsplitters
of the Judiciary Committee to the contrary
notwithstanding.
Prussia and llussla.
By cable despatch wo aro informed that the
Czar of all the Ilussias has conferred the
Grand CroBS of tho Order of St. Georgo upon
the King of Prussia, "as a proof of the cordial
relations existing between tho two countries."
This is a proof of the unmistakablo policy that
must be followed by these two great Powers in
order to confront any political combinations
that may transpire in Southern or Western
Europe, especially In reference to France.
Reports have been circulated respecting tho
complicity of Russia and Prussia in tbe recent
insurrection in Dalmatia, but in turn have
been promptly and officially contradicted. The
sentiments known to exist between Russia and
Turkey on tho one side, and the jealousy that
but recently gave rise to somo difference
between the Cabinets of Prussia and Austria
on the other, were well calculated to foster the
supposition that indirect means might have
been employed by which to annoy their respec
tive adversaries. Such would naturally result
by fomonting the insurrection in Dalmatia, and
therefore to a ccrlain extent warranted the
supposition. In rofcrcnce to graver matters,
however, the two- great nations of Russia and
Prussia know that they must go together in
ordor to combat alliances that may bo closed
by any of tho other great Powers of Europe ;
and although political matters may wear a
peaceful outward aspect for tho moment there
is no telling how soon the clouds of war may
gather on the horizon.
The Funniest Tiiino in Finance.?It is
one of tho most incomprehensible things that
John Bull siiould fancy that there is any value
in Confederatebonds, and should still hold them
in such estocm that they can "improve in price"
in any given circuinstancos. But still, as
there apparently are people in London who
will buy such things, wo will givo them the
latest (quotations. Two and a half millions in
these bonds were sold here tho other day for
thirty-five dollars. They were bought as
curiosities.
English Vessels Unlucky.?English ves
sels are strangely unlucky in their first
attempts to profit by tho opening of the Suez
Canal. Tho steamer Brazilian, from London,
although built expressly for Suez Canal traffic,
was found to draw toi> much water, and was
obliged to discharge half its cargo, when it
attempted a day or two ago to get through the
canal. The English must, however, have
known tho requisite measurement before build
ing the steamer.
Chownkk'b Quest Law?Anotiieu Cabk.?
The qneorest ca30 was that of Jackson, who
hunted a man like a rabbit and shot hiui in
tbe back of the head. Tho Coroner said it
was self-defence. Then a drunken ruffian
sl^t his drunken asso iate dead in a ruinshop,
and tho Coronor set hiin freo. Now wo have
a case at tho New York Hotel, in which the
Coroner's inquest is conducted on tho princi
ples of I ho Inquisition, with complete secrecy,
and without a coroner. Does not this depart
ment of tho administration of justice need
| uttcutiou?
France, A iu trail a and the Hnez Canal.
There seems to bo no good reason wbj tho
opening of the Suez Canal, with all its para
mount success, should not bring the valuable
trade of Australasia into direct connection with
Trance. In olden times, when the products of
the far East reached the Mediterranean over
and by caravans across tho desert, when the
ed Sea was the great water connection
e ween India and Southern Europe, tho cities
on the Mediterranean wore tho recipients of
| o wea th of Indus." But when navigation
1 #1? option to circumnavigate
| the Cape the,trade of the East drifted In that
direction and England almost monopolized the
whole of it. The opening of the Suez Canal,
however, has brought about a change. The
old cities on the Mediterranean have a new
life open to them. Tho fame of Tyro, Sidon
and Carthage, and tho more modern cities of
Magna Grecia, which were tho glory of that
day?11 fame that Genoa the Superb, and
Venice of the Dogoa onco shared?may bo
restored to tho still more modern ports of
Southern Franco through the medium of tho
Suez CanaL Some such thoughts are
evidently agitating the French mind jn3|
now, when suggestions are made to coalesca
j with tho colonial government of Australia in
the establishment of sueh a route as would
bring tho products of Australia?principally
wool?to a market in Marseilles. It is urged
that Australian wool and Indian shawls, spices
and other products of tho East which are con
sumed in Franco go direct to London, and that
i* rench products for tho Australian market havo
to go to the British colony by tho same chan
nel. Tho proposition just made is to open a
t direct communication between Australia and
the southern ports of France by means of tho
Suez Canal.
It may bo that tho cost of transshipment of
wool by this route would overbalance the loss
of timo in sending it by the ocean route round
tho Cape; but, after all, that is an ejperi
mont worth trying. Thoro ia no doubt that
tho products of India could be rcooived in tho
French markets upon moro advantageous
terms by tho Suez Canal than via tho Capa
and London, and might be thus restored to
tho Mediterranean its ancient prostigo as the
maritime highway from tho East to Central
und Southern Europe.
The Anti-Papal Congress at Nai-i.es num
bers two hundred delegates from Italy and
twenty from other countries. Garibaldi, Victor
Hugo and other leading radicals are not
present, but havo sent letters of excuse and
sympathy. Thus at Rome and at Naples tha
antagonistic forces of opinion are drawn up ia
battle array, and stand as it wero face to face,
ready and eager for tho impending conflict.
The Alabama Claims.?Tho London Timet
suggests the names of two eminent New York
lawyers, whom it invitos to state the facts and
tho law in relation to the Alabama claims,
its sudden, if tardy, desiro for information ia
commendable. But it only needs to consult
the files of the New Yokk Herald in order to
learn both the facts and tho law. It can thoa
say to the British government, tho facts are
that during the late war sixty odd American
vessels were destroyed by English piratea.
The law is, you must pay.
Two Good Things for Philadelphia?
l ive cents faro for the city horse cars, and tha
arrest and punishment of parties carrying con
I ceaIed weapons. Wo wonder if any such
[ things are in tho programme of our naw D^mo
t cratic Legislature.
The Viceroy and the Sultan.?Tho Vice
roy has complied with tho Sultan's ultimatum.
All its conditions havo been yielded to. Thia
is well; but it only means that the Viceroy
will go on ns ho has been doing. Apparently
the Sultan has humbled his vassal; really tha
vassal remains master of tho situation. E^ypt
will go ahead as before, and the Sultan will
not again rashly raise a difficulty.
