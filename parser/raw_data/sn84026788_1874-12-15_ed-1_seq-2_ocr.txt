resentatives an unsuccessful effort was made
for immediate consideration of a bill to repeal
the Poland "gig-law." After the President's
message was read, the legislative, naval, army,
Indian and fortification appropriation bills
were reported, and referred to the committee
of the whole. A bill was passed appropri
ating fands to purchase scales to be used by
the Postofficc Department, under the new
postage law.
In the Senate, on Tuesday, a bill was in
troduced to fix the salary ot the President ot
the United States at S25.UU0 alter tho term

Postmaster General to cause to be constructed
a lino of telegraph between Washington and

Lands of those companies, and a bill was in

In the House the committee on pnblij lands
was authorized to frame a general bill for the

The committee on naval affairs was directed
to inafce die-intc's<ig*tiou. The bill "for the
iTiprortment'df'the1 currency and the reduc
nterest im tBe^ft?s(ded debt of the
TJnifed Statya" yaa considereKfn committee
^eniiijjW^ was offered
i$ea,intimid?tion3and

ife cotorecT'sociefies-of that
c ifl'gtfrated the movement by forming
an^Bbeiatiop, tho objects of which are to dis~
card old political ties, and cultivate and main>
tain permanent peace with the white people
of the South. In an address which they have
issued they set forth that tbey have seen and
felt and ftill suffer un ier the consequences of
the vicious antagonism into which the "mere
fictions of poiitica! incendiaries" have led tliem
They bring strong indictments agains' their
despoilers. '-They have shorn us.'' they say,
"of onr pecuniary accumulations, the result
of weary years of toil, even pennies accumu
lated by our youth and fledgelings All this
we couid bear, but they have left u? despised
by our ocly true Jriemis through their knavish
representations and unmitigated falsehoods."
Such expressions, at least, show how keenly
the colored reop[p realize their wrongs, now
that their eyes are being < pened to their situ
ation, and they give an earnest of their dis
position to retrain the Uselessly lost confidence
of the paft and establish their claims to free
dom of thought and action in all that relates
to their personal and political interests.
"THE PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE;
[Synopsis from the Baltimore Sue.]
The most important features of the Presi
dent'a message havo > been ao far anticipate!
by tho telegraphic synopsis published yes
terday in our general press dispatches as ti
dispense with the necessity of a recapitulation
The lull text of the message invites littli
further remark, and still less of unfavorablt
criticism. It is moderate, cautious, am
thoroughly conservative in tone, and as sue!
will eomtneod itself to the majority of th<
American qeople Dispensing with the usua
commonplaces which have formed almost tht
stereotyped commencement of so many mes*
Silge>," the President follows the Uoratiai
maxim, and plunges at once in medial res.?
In the very first paragraph of the message,
and with military bluotness and directness o
purpose, hn takes the bull of -'the fioancia
question" boldly by the.horns. It is gratify
g to find th*t upon this all important subject
which is pre-eminently agd above all others,
tho question of the hour." the President'i
trumpet gives no uncertain sound. He de
clares in favor of resumption and of a returi
to decent money, not merely in the abstrac
or in vague and general terms, but explicitly
and specifically, urging upon Coniress, "a
this session." the doty and necessity o
placing the currency of the country upon i
basis, common to and recognized by the civi
lized world. In this portion of his message
in principle?-we do not speak of details?thi
Presidents views are as sound as a dollar?
and a gold dollar at that. The public credi
tor to bo paid in coin, "according to the bont
when tho debt was contracted, gold or it
equivalent." an obligation not to be evadet
?without national digrace j" the repeal of thi
legal-tender clause, take effect as to all con
tracts entered into after the day fixed in tht
repealing act; a revenue sufficiently in exces
of expenditure to insure an accumulation o
sold in the treasury to sustain resumption
and lastly, a system of free banking as essen
sential to give proper elasticity to the cur
rency. These are the salient fecommenda
tions urged by they President upon Congresi
at its present session as necessary to restore
the currency to a normal and healthful con
dition.
Foreign affirrs furnish no special occasiot
for remark or recommendation. The growint
importance of our relations, both commercia
and diplomatic, with China and Jnpan is nd
verted to. as is also tho subject of Chincst
immigration to this country, coupled with i
suggestion as to the need of further legisla
tion for the protection of Chinese immigrants
both male and feuia'c. The unfinished north
western boundary survey between the Unitet
States and the British provinces, the chronit
condition of lawlessness and brigandage oi
the Mexican frontier, anu the no less chronit
inability of Venezuela to discharge its in
debtedness to American citizens, receivt
stereotyped ment'on The duration and ten'
acity of the insurrection in Cuba, and tho in
jury and annoyance occasioned thereby t<
neutral powers are referred to in significan
language, and the* fae> of "pending negotia
tions" made the excuse for the absence of somi
positive suggestion in reference to this sub
jeet, as well as the unsettled business ofstb(
"Virginius" indemnity. A renewal of for
mer recommendations in reference to the de
fective state of our naturalization laws, and as
the laws regulating tho stuhis of Amoriaan
citizens horn abroad, conclutfes what the Pres
ident has to say upon topics connected with oui
?'foreign relations."
Attention is called to the reports of the
Secretaries of the Treasury.of War, the Navy
the Interior, and the Postmaster General, in
reference to matters belonging to their re
spective departments The troubles in Loui
siana and Arkansas give the President an op
portunity both to explain his past policy in
reference to affairs in those States and to in
dulge in some general observation and recom
mendations in reference to the condition oi
the South which are for the most part con
ceived and expressed in a moderate and con
ciiitorv temper
The President deprecates the necessity fot
any federal or executive interference in the
local concerns of the States, justifies his re
cent action in Louisiana by reference to the
neglect and failure of Congress at its last ses
sion to act upon the recommendations of his
former messages, and indicates thst in ref
erence to Southern affairs generally, and -'out
rages" in particular, the truth is to be looked
for between two extremes. An eminently
just and proper suggestion in this connection,
although found in another portion of the mes
sage. is tho recommendation to restore to the
list of pensioners of the war of 1S12 the few
old persons residiug in the South whose pen
sions havo been cut off by their inability tr
take the ironclad oath. The creation of twe
additional circuit judgeships, with or without
the addition of two more justices to tho Su
preme Court, is recommended on account ol
the increased extent of territory to bo tra
versed and business to be transacted in the
federal courts The President claims for hid
Indian policy, whatever that may be. "the
most benefieial results." and promises ad
herence to it. For the comparative failure of
civil, service reform, the President plainly
takes Congress to tusk, and intimates that, al
though. himself still in favor of it, he "will
have no more o^gjflflBM^np the whole
btudiress ?s a^^^^^^^^^^B>ngress comes
?nyt* ?c ~r- t -
rtiicy,'"it'?i tfegative rather than poartivoin its
character,\nd is calculated to afford bnt "cold
comfort" eipher to a greedy lobby or a heated
-?pd noreasonvis partisanship. It will proba
bly meet withHess adverse criticism and more
positive commendation than any message which
President Grant has sent to Congress since
the commencement of his presidential term.
United States Senator.?Wo learn that
the prominent friends of Mr Faulkner in
this county hold a meeting in this placo last
week, at which they unanimously determined
that his name should he presented to the nest
legislature of West Virginia as a candidate
for the position of United States Senator.
We nfe not present at the meeting, and
therefore may not be accurately informed of
its proceedings; but heard that a committee
of ten or twelve gentlemen were appointed to
prepare an address to the Senate and House
of Delegates, setting forth the grounds upon
which in their opinion, he should reoeivc the
favorable consideration of those bodies. We
need hardly say that this is tho sentiment of
the democracy of the county of Berkeley ;
and so believing we shall give as we have
always done our warm and cordial support to
the result of their action.

THE PRESIDENT ON SOUTHERN
OUTRAGES.
While we have giveD the President credit
for the general spirit of his message, and the
purposes aimed at in it, says the Baltimore
Sun, there can be no doubt that on the sub
ject of Southern outrages he speaks in a some
what ambiguous tone. He thinks that there
have been wrongs committed ou both whites
and blacks. lie speaks of white leagues and
bands of masked and armed men in connec
tion with preparations for the late election.
There were decided indications, ho thinks, on
that occasion of a determination, by acts of
violence and intimidation, to deprive citizens
of the freedom of the ballot because of their
political opinion. IIow far the President may
be correctly informed on this subject we will
not undertake to say, but it would seem that
he is not over confident himself of his facts
from tho apparent tone of apology in which he
justifies his interference in Southern affairs,
while at tho same time professing to regret its
necessity. He confesses that Southern citi
zens have suffered grievous wrongs, and admits
that "the better part of them" have "a dispo
sition to be law-abiding and to do no violence
either to individuals or to the laws existing,"
and says that he "sympathizes with their pros
trate condition, and would do all in his power
to relievo them, acknowledging that they
have had most frying governments to live
under, and very oppressive ones in tho way of
taxation." The late elections indicate that
the American people concur in this view of
the Southern situation, and emphatically show
that they do not concur with the President in
his belief of outrages to such an extent upon
any class of voters in the South as to justify
federal interference.
