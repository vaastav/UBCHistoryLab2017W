A TERRIBLE

But time and soolusion fail to

head justice hangs, like tho
sword of Damocles, suspended
by a slender thread.
Comfortless ia the ono whofe

tho old, old lesson that there are
things worse than death that
the name of liberty is' a mookery

tho railroad rate question. ' Ho

The most noticeable feature of
tho meeting of Congress, was tho
absence of flowers from tho mom
bets' desks the result of Uncle
Joe's orders. All other stunts
were same aa usual.
Tho assertion that tho Italians
that are locating in Texas are
going to vote the Republican
ticket, is another proof that Cecil

Undor tho head, "Problems of
Labor," he tiealB with injunc
tions, child employment and wo
men who work. Ho rocommi-nds
a remedy to prevent tho employ
ment of ohild labor. Thero are,
he says, 5,000,000 American wo
men engaged in various ocoupa
tions, and he would throw every
safeguard possible around them,
protecting them in thoir rights to
gain an honest livelihood, but in
his argument says : "Tho intro
duction of women into industry
is working change and disturb
ance in the domestio and social
life of tho nation. The deorease
in marriago, and especially in
tho birth rate, has been ooin-
oident with it."
His "square deal" policy cov
ers great soope and is worth
while reading. In it ho deals
with olass spirit, insurance, state
supervision, etc As to tho re
vision of tho revenues ho points
out the need of stability rather
than any attempt to attain per
fection. Tho. question of poaco
ocoupies muoh space, and in this
ho points out what should and
should not bo done to maintain
peace between nations without
sacrifice of honor. A ploa for
tho ratification of the treaty now
pending with San Domingo, the
importance of naval training,
and Chinese immigration are
treated at length, and after ad

Separate State idea into a cooked
hat, by advising immediate state
hood fur Oklahoma and Indian
Territory jointly. Ho concludes
his message with a dissertation
upon tho Panama canal, und
upon the improvement of our
consular service.
In some respects thiB is a most
lomarkablo message to congroBS,
but then it comes from a most
remarkable man. ;
I recommend that Indian Territory and Okla-
homa be admitted'as one state and that New Mexico
and Arizona be admitted as one state. There is no

of convenience only, as binding
us on the question of admission to statehood.' Noth
ing has taken up more time in the congress during
the past few years than the question as to the state
hood to be granted to the four territories above

mentioned, and after carefui consideration of all
that has been developed in the discussion of the
question, I recommend that they be immediately
admitted as two states. There is no justification 'for
further delay, and the advisability of making the
four territories into two states has been clearly
established. ---Theodore Roosevelt.
