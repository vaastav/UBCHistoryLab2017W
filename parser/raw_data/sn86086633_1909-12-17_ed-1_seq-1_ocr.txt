repulsing his exiled daughters and
clinging tenaciously to his favorites.

the three daughters, urrlved here to
day. The second daughter, the unfor
tunate Stephanla, was here when her

' Life of King Leopold.
Leopold Lrfuls Philippe Marie Victor,
king of the Belgluns, was born In
Brussels, April 9, 1835, and succeeded
to the throne upon the death of his
father, the late King Leopold I, which
occurred Dec. 10. 1865. Leopold receiv
ed a liberal education and In his youth
traveled extensively through Europe,
Egypt and Asia Minor. As Duke of
Brabant, he took a prominent part In
several important discussions In the
wenate. When he came to the throne
he was thought to possess a broad and
active mind and was looked upon as a
ruler who would understand the wants
of hla people. In hla early days he
gave himself up to the study of the
trreat economical questions that today
are paramount. He made exhaustive
researches Into finance, commerce, in
dustry and engineering. His first
upeech in the senate, delivered several
years before he came to the throne,
was to advocate the establishment of
a maritime service between Antwerp
and the Levant.
A Keen Busin Man.
During his many years on the throne
Leopold proved himself to be an ad
mirable monarch and a keen business
man. In the latter capacity he was
without a peer among European royal
ty. His financial achievements In the
Congo, in China, in the United States
and In other parts of the world are
proof sufficient of this fact It was ow
ing to the king's untiring energy ana
perseverance that Belgium has. In the
Congo Free State, an outlet for her
commercial and Industrial activity. He
was active on the various stock ex
changes and seemed to find more satis
faction In launching and directing
great Industrial and commercial enter
t.ri.. than in administering the af
fair. r hi- Unedom. The Congo Free;
State was his pet hobby.
Often embarrassed him financially, buij

NEW PALACE OF THE KING AT B
BERT, WHO SUCCE
In later years the venture reaped vast
profits and became, by reason of . its
maladministration and by the violation
of all stipulations In connection with
its constitution, . a veritable plague
spot, and nil the civilized worll.hu,d
dered at the reports of the uppulling
cruelties perpetuated upon the natives
by the agents of the king.
Unpopular With People.
Despite his business ability, his vast
learning and his liberality as a mon
arch, King Leopold was far from being
popular, even with his own people. His
face was rigid and repelled rather than
encouraged. His manners were cour
teous, his conversation charming, yet
he struck all men who came in contact
with him as a man without enthusiasm
or imagination and incapable of excit
ing these In others. In his tastes and
habits he was as democratic as any
shopkeeper.
Many things In his charneter seem
contradictory. He read everything that
came to his hand, was conscientiously
devoted to the business of state and
knew even the municipal political af
fairs of every city In Itelglum, yet he
delighted In gossip and scandal, nnd
his adventures- with women furnished
columns of copy for the European press
for years.
In 1853, when seventeen years of
age, Leopold was married to the Arch
duchess Marie Ilenrlette of Austria,
second daughter of the late Archduke
Joseph. Palatine of Hungary The
queen died September 19, 1902, after
having sufferid for years with a mal
ady of the heart. They had one son
nnd three daughters. The son died In
1869, at the age of ten years. The eld
est daughter, the Princess Stephanie,
was married to the Archduke Rudolph
of Austria, who died tragically in the
Myerling forest. Stephanie later be
came the Countess Lonyny. Her sec
ond marriage made King Leopold so
angry that when she came to attend
her mother's funeral the king drove
her from beside her mother's coffin.
Concerning Family Affairs.
The second daughter, the Princess
Louise, was married to Philip of Saxe
Coburg, and by him was so cruelly
treated,' It was said, that she lost her
mind. At any rate she became a men
tal wreck and for several years was
confined In an asylum. The third
daughter, the Princess Clementine, was
engaged to her cousin, the Prince Bald
win, who was heir to the throne, and
who was killed by an angry husband a
few days before the date set for-the
wedding. Then she was said to be
about to be betrothed to Prince Fer
dinand of Bulgaria, but that fell
through. She Is of a very religious
turn of mind nnd It has been often
reported that she Intended to enter a
convent. Still another ill-fated rela
tive of the late king was his only sis
ter, the ex-empress Carlotta, the wid
ow' of the puppet Emperor Maximilian
of Mexico, and she has been mentally
unbalanced since the execution of her
husband. From time to time In recent
years stories have been current to the
effect that King Leopold had appro
priated to his own use the vast fortune
of Carlotta. but whether this be true or
not has never been definitely learned.
AHsgod Scandalous Actions.
King Leopold spent much of his time
in Tarls and his adventures there for

two hemispheres have discussed for

SCORES ILLINOIS CENTRAL.
Attorney General Stead Argues on Be
half of State in Suit.
Springfield. III., Dec. 17. Attorney
Oeneral Stemd prefaced his argument
before the Judges of the supreme court
in the suit t compel the Illinois Cen
tral to account for seven per cent of
Its gross receipts from charter lines
here today with a statement of the
case which the state of Illinois seeks
to recover approximately $20,000,000
from the railroad. The attorney gen
eral showed the state had given the
company 2,595,000 acres of land as a
right of way and he claimed this had
been sold by the road, for $30,000,000,
which was more than sufficient to
build the road. Claims now made by
the Illinois Central, said Stead, that it
owes the state nothing because of this
land grant, as an example of Ingrati
tude, ljas no parallel since the time
of Judas Iscarlot. The charter grant
ed the railroad, he claimed, was an
absolute contract by which the state
was to receive not less than seven per
cent of the gross receipts until the
company furnished the state copies of
a detailed account of receipts. Since
1877 this accounting was not kept sat
isfactory to state. The lines of the
company have been extend) d until now
there are 4,377 miles and upon all this
mileage the stte claims a pro rata
share. Another point made by the
counsel for the state was that In the
matter of bridge earnings at Cairo
and Dubuque, the state is entitled to
at least $7,000,000 more than It has
received. The question or profit from
the dining car service elso was touch
ed on. Secretary of War Dickinson
was in court, prepnred to present his
argument for the Illinois Central road,
of which he was general counsel when
the suit was begun.

Managua, Nicaragua, Dec. 17. Zela

message to. President Taft, suylng he
had shown hla good faith by resigning
In order that Nicaragua might resume
friendly relations with, the United
States. He added , that he proposed to
leave the country, but stood ready to
account for his acts us president.
Zelaya's message to Taft follows:
"December 4th I cabled Washington
this message: 'Secretary Knox: i be
lieve the sources of your information
are prejudiced and request the U. 8. to
send a commission of Investigation. If
lis findings show my administration to
be detrimental to Central America I
will resign.' I have received no reply.
To avoid harm to my county, and de
siring that it shall renew friendly re
lations with the U. S. I have today
sent my resignation to congress. As
my opponents consider my presence a
disturbing factor I propose to show my
good faith by leaving Nicaragua. I
stand ready to account for my acts." ,
U, 8. Vice Consul Harry H, Leonard,
stationed at Corlnto, arrived here today
to assist Acting Consul Caldera. A
service by. courier has been established
between Managua and Corlnto to keep
officers of the American warships In
Corlnto harbor informed of develop
ments at the capital.
U. S. Won't Oppose Madriz.
Washington, Dec, 17. The passing
of Zelaya as a dominant influence for
evil in Central America, and especially
In Nicaragua, is regarded here as a
long step In the direction of better
things. The government does not take
kindly to the Riovement to make Ma
drla president, although it is Improb
able the United States will take active
measures to prevent his installation as
president in the event of his being reg
ularly placed In temporary power and
later fairly elected. The murder of
Cannon and Groce Is a matter entirely
separated from other questions in
volved and at the proper time when the
proper government has been installed
the U. 8. will demand reparation and
that demand probably will involve the
arrest and punishment of Zelaya.
LITIGATION OYFR WILL OF
ALEX. T. STEWART RECALLED
Sale in Partition at White Plain To
morrow Will Settle all Detail
of Controversy Started by
Niece of Deceased.
New York. Dec. 17. A sole In par
tition to take place in White Plains
tomorrow morning revives memories
of the old litigation over the will of
the late Alexander T. Stewart, the first
of America's "Merchant princes." Mr.
Stewart died In 1876 owning the prop
erty which is to be sold and which
consists of about one hundred and
fifty acres of land situated, in the
towns of Rye and Harrlon.
Ity his will Mr. Stewart left all of
his property to his widow, Cornelia M.
Stewart. Mrs. Stewart died in 188.
leaving a will appointing Judge Henry
Hilton executor and trustee, and giv
ing practically absolute power to him
to dispose of her enormous estate as
he should see fit. A niece of Mrs.
Stewart contested the will on the
ground of undue Influence exertel
over Mrs. Stewart by Judge Hilton.
The contest began on the day of the
great blizzard of 1888, and Roscoe Con
kllng, who was counsel in the case for
Judge Hilton, lost his life as a result
of his going to court on that day and
attempting to walk home through the
snow. Ellhu Root was associated with
Mr. Conkling In the case, while tho
contestant was represented by eminent
counsel headed by Joseph II. Choate.
The property to be sold tomorrow
was part of the real estate Included
this action. The will contest was af
terward settled between the heirs and
Judge Hilton, but the partition ac
tion was continued as a friendly ne
ever since the settlement. The flnl
eteps In It are now about to be takn,
one of which is the sale of the prop
erty In question. The sale derives ad
ditional interest on account of the
Revolutionary period memories con
nected with the ground. A part of the
site belonged to Major General Thom
as Thomas, a very distinguished Rev
olutionary partisan, and the remains
of his mansion are still. to be seen.
The estate overlooks the scene of the
historic battle of White Plains. whUie
not far away Is also the home In which
General Putnam waa surprised by the
Rrltlsh while shaving, and escaped hy
riding his horse down a stone stair
way. Miss Parth left yesterday afternoon
for Buffalo, where she will spend the
holidays.
Wisconsin Senator Says Fresl
dent Has Sidestepped the
, . ' Roosevelt Policies.
HIS MESSAGE iS DISAPPOINTING
After Reviewing Executive's Speech of
Acceptance . and Promises the
Senator. Declares .Taft ia
Delaying the Game..
Madison, Wis., Dec. 17. That Presi
dent Taft's message to congress Is
"disappointing;" that the Roose
velt. policies ure sidestepped and that
the tardiness of the executive In pre
sentlng . Issues of vital Importance
leaves "congress and the public to in
fer, as they well may, after the experi
ence of the special session, that he Is
awaiting the program of Aldrlch and
Cannon," is the statement made by
Senator La Follette today.
For the first time since the election
of President Taft, Senator La Follette
has determined to let the public kno
what he thinks of the Taft adminis
tration. In no uncertain terms ho an
nounces his views in this week's issue
of La Follette's Weekly magazine and
the whole tenor of the article would
indicate that President Taft has for
saken the "Roosevelt policies."
. After reviewing President Taft's
speech of acceptance last March, anl
his many promises. Senator La Fol
lette turns to a discussion of the tariff
session and declares that the "public
condemns the legislation."
"On Tuesday, December 7, President
Taft's message on general legislation
was presented to congress and the
country," says Senator Lti Follette.
'It la a document of forty pages. Tho
message Is silent, where It should have
spoken strongly.
"The man so often quoted In Mr
Taft's speech of acceptance and in his
addresses during the campaign Is
twice Referred to in this message.
Once as 'my predecessor' who directed
attention to the 'outrageous conditions
In the workjiouse and J.ilf of the Dis
trict of Columbia, and again where
President Taft says that following the
course of 'my distinguished predeces
sor, I earnestly recommend to congress
the consideration and passage of a ship
subsidy bill.'
"We regret to say that the message
is disappointing. It was to be expect
ed that the paper would be conserva
tlve and Judicial In Its tone, but the
country did not expect an extended
narrative of well known foreign rela
tlons and a recapitulation of depart
mental reports. It expected a strong.
able, vitally Interesting state pap
on the great national problems which
have come Into the life of the present
generation.
"The president promises special
messages later In the session, when
he will discuss conservation of natural
resources, Interstate commerce amend
ments, and the Sherman act. We be
lieve It a mistake to delay the pre
sentation of these or any Important
subjects. At the beginning of the ses
sion congress Is more receptive .less
occupied and absorbed than at any
time later. It is at the beginning of
the session that any message gets
Its best hearing. The president will
not get the same attention from the
public later, and this Is Important for
it counts In the final result.
"A vigorous message for tariff revi
sion, based upon the difference In the
cost of production, at the beginning of
the extra session would have been pro
ductive of very different results. If
the president expects to advance the
Roosevelt policies, he will do well to
go about It promptly, and not leave
congress and the public to infer, as
they well may, after the experience of
the extra session, that he Is awaiting
the program of Aldrlch and Cannon."

New York, 'Dec. 17. The magnates

ly , In complete deadlock today when
they met again to select a president of

phy, president of the Chicago lub, as
serted his readiness to sit all winter, if
necessury, to elect Ward.
New York, Chicago, Philadelphia and
Brooklyn presented today an unbroken
front for Ward, while Cincinnati, Pitts
burg, Boston und St. Louis seek to

promise candidate. The move of Qar-
ry Hermann In bringing forward the
name of Brown yesterday Insteud of
Heydler was regarded today as un ex
tremely strategic one inasmuch as it
assured Hermann and his friends the
absolute support of Stanley Robinson,
who favored Brown. Hermann Is now

mann said today: "You know as

Heydler In case he was not elected.
SANTA ClAUS SHIP LEAVES
NEW YORK TOR EUROPE TODAY
American Liner is Loaded Down With
Quantities of . Christmas Mail,
Presents and Large Num
ber of Money Orders.'
New York. Dec. 17. The American
liner St. Louis, which left her dock at
10 o'clock this morning bound for Eu
rope, is entitled to be called a veritable
Santa Claus ship. Her great hold was
literally crammed and Jammed full of
Christmas mail and hundreds of thou
sands of dollars worth of presents and
money orders. She Is the last steam
ship to leave this side by which malls
can reach Great Britain and the Con
tinent before Christmas day. The St.
Louis Is due at Plymouth, Cherbourg
and Southhampton the day before
Christmas.
It was with a sigh of relief that the
hundreds of employes of the New York
postofflee, and particularly of the for
eign malls branch, greeted the depart
ure of the St. Louis, knowing that a big
share of their heavy burden of Christ
mas work was over.
No one thing reflects the condition
of prosperity In the United States bet
ter than the volume of Christmas
malls for Europe. The authorities have
learned to look upon It as an accurate
barometer. Following the panic In
1907 there was a startling drop in the
number of money orders Issued on Eu
rope for the Christmas season. That
the country Is again enjoying its full
measure of prosperity Is evidenced by
the fact that the outward-bound
Christmas malls were never heavier
than they have been during the past
few weeks.
The bulk of the money orders and
Christmas presents sent abroad go to
Germany, England, Sweden, Russia
nd Italy. For many years Ireland
held first place on the list, but now the
Emerald Isle has fallen behind several
of the continental countries. Two
things are held responsible for the
falling off of the amount of money sent
Ireland at Christmas time. One of
these is that the number of immigrants
from Ireland has steadily decreased
urlng the past decade or so, and the
other reason Is to be found In the
greater prosperity which Ireland her
self enjoys.
The number of foreign-born Amer
icans who have returned to Europe
during the past three or four weeks to
spend Christmas In their old homes
has been unusually large. It is esti
mated that no fewer than 10,000 Swed-
sh-Amerlcans from the middle states
nd the northwest have left New
York for Sweden since the first of No
vember. LOSE LIVES IN FIRE.
Philadelphia, Ta., Dec. 17. At least
five girls employed by Schrack & Sher
wood, manufacturers of undertakers'
upplles, whose building was burned
last night, are missing and It Is feared
they lost their lives. One fireman, Jo
seph Toner, was killed while searching
for the missing women.

Boston Will Experience Lively
Politics During the Next
Three Weeks.
PARTY LINES ARE WIPED OUT
James J. Storrow and John F. Fitrger
aid Seem to be Main Performers,
Financial Faction is Split
Over Them.
Boston, Mass.. Dec. 17. The time for
filing nomination papers for the flr.-t
city election under the new plan
government adopted by the citizens r
Boston last November expired today,
which means that the actual campaign
Is now on and will continue with fev
erish Intensity until election dav.
which will be the second Tuesday of
January. politicians big and sma.l
are looking forward to the greatest
carnival In the city's political history.
The next three weeks are expected to
furnish the greatest amount of politi
cal gayety ever crowded Into an equal
period In this or any other city.
Of candidates there are a-plenty.
The new charter provides that any
registered voter may run for mayor or
for the city council or for the school
board If he will obtain five thousani
signatures of registered voters. Hav
ing obtained the signatures, and the
fact that they are those of registered
voters having been attested by the
election commissioners, his name can
then go on the official ballot, but with
out any political designation whatever,
because It Is the purpose of the plan to
obliterate party lines In Boston elec
tions. Tho leading, or at least the most
conspicuous candidates for the mayor
alty are James J. Storrow, who his
been Indorsed by the Citizens' Munici
pal league, and John F. Fitzgerald,
who was mayor of Boston In 1906 and
1907. While these two are regarded
s the main performers, there are a
number of others who have filed their
pupers and will make the race. Among
them are George A. Blbbard. the pres
ent mayor; Frederick J. Brand, chair
man of the board of aldermen; Mat
thew J. Cummlngs, national preslde.it
of the Ancient Order of Hibernian.'),
and Nathaniel H. Taylor, a newsjap-r
editorial writer and a brother of Gn
Chaiies H. Taylor, publisher of th
Boston Globe.
Mr. Storrow's entry in the race has
split the Boston financial fabric In two
and threatens to result In the biggest
battle between Boston financiers that
has ever been waged. Mr. Storrow Is
a. member of the firm of Iee, Hlggln
son & Co., the state street bankers. He
Is a man of great wealth and has been
carefully laying his plans to obtain the
nomination for mayor for the last half
doisen years. In his present fight he is
supported not only by his own firm,
but by numerous other bankers, brok
ers and financiers, the gas companies
and the mill corporations.
Against Mr. Storrow In the flht are
aligned the banking firm of Kidder.
Pea body Company, the New Haven
Railroad, the Boston Elevated Railway,
the electric companies and the great
chain of banks allied with the Nation
al Shuwmut Bank, of which William A
Gaston, who has figured prominently
in democratic national policies, Is
president. It is understood that these
lirge financial Interests will throw
their support to former Mayor Fltt
srerald. who has waged an exceedingly
active and picturesque campaign since
the day the new charter was adopted
It Is expected that more than a half
million dollars will be expended In the
campaign during the next three or
four weeks, and It is not surprising
that politicians high and low are look
ing forward to such a carnival as they
have never experienced before.
