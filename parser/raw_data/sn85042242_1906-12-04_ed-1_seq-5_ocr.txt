In 1886 oyer 16,000 young seals were
found dead from starvation on the
Pribilof islands. In 1897 it was esti­
mated that since pelagic, sealing feegan
upward of 400,000 adult female seals
had been tcilled at sea and over 800,000
young seals had died of starvation as
1J»e result' Tbe revolting barbarity of
«uch a practice, as well as the wapte-
ful destruction which it involves,
needs no demonstration and is its own
condemnation. The Bering sea tribu­
nal, which sat in P&riS In 1893 and
which decided against the claims of
the United States to exclusive Juris­
diction in the' waters of Bering sea
and to a property right in the fu)r seals
when outside of the three mile limit,
determined also upon certain regula­
tions which the tribunal considered
sufficient for the proper protection and
preservation of the fur setl in or
habitually resorting to the Bering sea.
The tribunal ty its regulations estab­
lished a close season, from the 1st of
May to the 31st of July, and excluded
all killing in the waters within sixty
miles around the Pribilof Islands.
They also provided that the regula­
tions which they had determined upon,
with a view to the protection and pres­
ervation of the seals, should be sub­
mitted every five years to new exami­
nation^ so as 4o enable both interested
governments to consider whether in
the light of past experience there was
.occasion for any modification thereof.
The regulations have proved plainly
Inadequate to accomplish the object of
protection and preservation of the fur
seals, and for a long time this govern
ment has been trying invalhtosecure
from Great Britain such revision and
modification of the regulations,as were
contemplated and provided for by the
award of the tribunal of Paris.
The process of destruction has been
accelerated during recent years by the
appearance of a number of Japanese
Vessels engaged in pelagic sealing.
As

have paid no attention either to the

prosecuted their work up to the very

found half skinned-and still alive. The
raids "were repelled only by the use qf
firearms, and five of the raiders were
killed, two were wounded and twelve
captured, including the two wounded.
Those captured have since been tried
and sentenced to imprisonmnent. An

EFFORTS FOR PEACE
Under the guidance of Russia the ar­
rangement of the preliminaries for
such a conference has been progress­
ing during the past year. Progress
has necessarily been slow owing to the
great number of countries to be con­
sulted upon every question that has
arisen. It is a matter of satisfaction
that ail of the American republics have
now, for the first time, been invited to
join in the proposed conference.
The close connection between the
subjects to be taken up by the Red
Cross conference held at Geneva last
summer and the subjects which natp
rally would come before The Hague

was desirable to have the work of the

aside. No other date has yet been sug­
gested. A tentative programme for
the conference has been proposed by
the government of Russia, and the
subjects which It enumerates are un­
dergoing careful examination and con­
sideration in preparation for the con­
ference.

Peace and Righteousness.
It must ever be Jiept in mind that
war is not merely justifiable but Im­
perative upofl honorable men, upon an
honorable nation, where peace can only
be obtained by the sacrifice of con­
scientious conviction or Of national
welfare. Peace is normally a great
good, and normaUy|ilt coincides with
righteousness, but it is righteousness,
and not peace, wblch should bind the
conscience of a nation as it should
bind the conscience of an individual,
and neither a nation nor an individual
can surrender conscience to another's
keeping. Neither can a nation which is
an entity and which does not die as
individuals die refrain from taking

soul than the most prosperous peace
obtained by acquiescence in wrong or
Injustice. Moreover, though it Is crim­
inal for a nation hot to prepare for war
so that it may escape the dreadful con­
sequences of being defeated in war,'
yet it must always be remembered that
wen to be defeated In war maybe far

The readiness and efficiency of both

afresh their value to the nation. This
readiness and efficiency would have
been very much less had it not been
for the existence of the general staff
in the army and the general board In
the navy. Both are essential to the
proper development and use of our mil­
itary forces afloat and ashore. The

bandied flawlessly. It was the swift

ary President of the Tfaird Confer

de Janeiro, My ty* JWif
Mr. President and Gentlemen of the
Third Conference
at
American Repub­
lics—I beg you to believe that I highly
appreciate and teank" you for the honor
you do me.
I bring from my country a special
greeting to her elder sisters in the civ­
ilization of America.
Unlike as we are in many respects,
we are alike in this—that we are all
engaged under new conditions and free
from the traditional forms and limita­
tions of the old world in working out
tbe same problem of popular self gov­
ernment
It Is a difficult and laborious task for
each of us. Not in one generation or
In one century can the effective con­
trol of a superior sovereign,, so long
deemed necessary to government be
rejected and effective self control by
the governed be perfected in its place.
The first fruits of democracy are, ma&y
of them, crude and unlovely. Its mis­
takes are many, its partial failures
many. Its sins not few'. Capacity for
by nature. It is an art to be learned,
and it is also an expression of char­
acter to be developed among all tbe
thousands of men who exercise popular
sovereignty.
To reach the goal toward which we
are pressing forward the governing
multitude must first acquire knowledge
that comes from universal education,
wisdom that follows practical experi­
ence, personal independence and self
respect befitting men who acknowledge
no superior, self control to replace that
external control which a democracy re­
jects, respect for law, obedience to tbe
lawful expressions of the public will,
consideration for the opinions and In­
terests of others equally entitled to a
voice in the state, loyalty to that ab­
stract conception—one's country—as In­
spiring as that loyalty to personal sov­
ereigns which has so illumined the
pages of history, subordination of per­
sonal interests to the public good, love
of justice and mercy, of liberty and
order. All these we must seek by
slow and patient effort and of how
many shortcomings In his own land
and among his own people each one of
us Is conscious.
Yet no student of our times can fail
to see that not America alone, but the
whole civilized world. Is swinging
away from its old governmental moor­
ings and intrusting the fate of its civ­
ilization to the capacity of the popular
mass to govern. By this pathway
mankind is to travel whithersoever It
leads. Upon the success of this our
great undertaking the hope of human­
ity depends.
Nor can we fall to See that the world
makes substantial progress toward
more perfect popular self government
I believe it to be true that viewed
against the background of conditions a
century, a generation, a decade ago..
government in my own country has ad­
vanced in the Intelligent participation
of the great mass of the people, In the
fldelity and honesty with which they
are represented, In respect for law. In
obedience to the dictates of a sound
morality and in effectiveness and pu
rity of administration.
Nowhere in the world has this prog­
ress been more marked than In Latin
America. Out of the wrack of Indian
fighting and race conflicts and civil
permitted by the people's indifference.
Loyalty to country, its peace. Its dig
nity, its honor, has risen above parti-1
sanship for individual leaders. Thej
rule of law supersedes the rule of man.
Property is protected, and the fruits of
enterprise are secure. Individual lib-.
erty is respected. Continuous public
policies are followed. National faith is
held sacred. Progress has not been
equal everywhere, but there has been
progress everywhere. The movement
In the right direction is general. The
right tendency is not exceptional it Is
continental. Tbe present affords just

bright with hope.

the conduct of any state, but many sub­

possibility of removing barriers to inter
course, of ascertaining for tbe common
benefit what advances have been made
by each nation in knowledge, in experi­
ence, in enterprise, in the solution of dif­
ficult questions of government and in eth­
ical standards, of perfecting our knowl
edge of each other and of doing away
with the misconceptions, the misunder­
standings and tbe resnltant prejudices
that are such fruitful sources qf con­

And there are some subjects in the pro»w'^
gramme which Invite discussion that may
lead the American republics toward an
agreement upon principles, tbe general
practical application-of which can come
only in tbe future through long and pa­
tient effort Some advance at least may
be made here toward the complete rule
of Justice and peace among nations In
lieu of force and war.
The association of so many eminent men?

In their own homes the friendships that
will arise among you, the habit of tem­
perate and kindly discussion of matters
of common interest the ascertainment of
common sympathies and aims, the dissi
pation of misunderstandings, the exhibi­
tion to all .the American peoples of thi.=
peaceful and considerate method of con­
ferring upon international questions—this
alone, quite irrespective of the rendu
tlons you may adopt and the conventions
you may sign, will mart: a substantial
advance in the direction of international
good understanding.
These beneficent results the government
and the people of the United States of
America greatly desire. We wish for TIG
victories but those of peace, for no terri­
tory except our own. for no sovereignty
except the sovereignty over ourselves.
We deem the independence and aqua!
rights of the smallest and weakest mem­
ber of the family of nations entitled to
as much respect as those of £hc greatest
empire, and we deem the observance of
that respect the chief guaranty of the
weak against the oppression of the
strong. We neither claim nor desire any
rights or privileges or powers that we
do not freely concede to every American
republic. W* tylsh to Increase our pros­
perity, to expand our trade, to grow la
wealth. In wisdom and in spirit but our
conception of the true way to accomplish
this is not to pull down others and profit
by their ruin, but to help all friends to
a common prosperity and a common
growth that we may all become greater
and stronger together.
Within a few months, for tbe first time,
the recognized possessors of every foot of
soil upon the American continents be
and I hope will be represented with the
acknowledged rights of equal sovereign
states In the great world congress at The
Hague This will be the world's formal
and final acceptance of the declaration
that so part of the American continents
Is to be deemed subject to colonisation.
Let us pledge ourselves to aid each ether

THE MANTO.
A Garment That All Chilean Women
Wear to Church.
The Chilean women's most retching
garment, wrap, or what you will, is
the manto. It is of some kind of
fine black material and is worn thrown
over the head. Sometimes a flap of it
is drawn tightly across the forehead.
After being thrown over the head the
manto, by some means which I hare
as yet been unabie to discern, is cinch­
ed In close about the neck.
This cinching in at t*u.» neck wakes*
hands of the wearer. It is usually, but
not always, worn over the street ras
