Redemption »l'tireeubaok*.
I renew so much of my recommenda­
tion of December, 181(7, as follows: That
when any of the Uniti-d Status notes are
presented for redemption infold sueh
uotes shull be %ept uud set apart and only
paid out In exchange for gold. This In an
obvious duty. If the holder of the nitod
States unto prefers the gold and gets it
from th» government he should not re
oelvo buck from the government a United
States note without paying gold in ex­
change for or it. The reason for this Is
made all the more apparent when the gov­
ernment issues an interest-bcaringdebt to
provide gold for the redemption of Uuited
States notes—a lion-Interest bearing debt.
Surely, it should not pay them out again
except on demand and for gold. If they
are put out in any other way they may
return again, to be followed by another
bond Issue to redeem them—another inter­
est-bearing debt to redeem a non-intorest
bearing debt."
This recommendation was made in the
belief that such provisions of law would
Insure to a great degree the safety of the
present standard, and better protect our
currency from the dangers to which it is
subjected from a disturbance in the gen­
eral business conditions of the country.
In my judgment the present condition
of the treasury amply justifies the imme­
diate enactment of the legislation recom­
mended one year ago, under which a por­
tion of the gold holdings should be placed
in a trust fund from which greenbacks
should be redeemed upon presentation,
but when once redeemed should not there­
after be paid out except for gold It is
not to be inferred that other legislation
relating to our currency is not required
on the contrary there is an obvious de­
mand for it
The importance of adequate provision
which will insure to our future a money
standard related to our money standard
now and to that of our commercial rivals
is generally recognized.
The companion proposition that our do­
mestic paper currency shall be kept safe
and yet be so related to the needs of our
indurties and international commerce as
to be adequate and responsive to such
needs is a proposition scarcely less impor­
tant The subject in all its parts is com­
mended to the wise consideration of the
congress.
NEW MARITIME POLICY.
Acquisition of New Territory Makes It
Almost Imperative.
The annexation of Hawaii and the
changed relations of the United States
to Cuba, Porto Rico and the Philippines
as the result of the war compels the
prompt adoption of a maritime policy by
the United States.
There should be established regular and
frequent steamship communication un­
der the American flag with the newly
acquired islands. Spain furnished to its
colonies at an annual cost of about $2,
000,000 steamship lines connecting with a
portion of the world's markets, as well as
trade circles at home ports. The United
States will not undertake to do less. It is
our duty to furnish the people of Hawaii
with facilities under national control for
their export and import trade. It will be
conceded that the present situation calls
for legislation which shall be prompt,
durable and liberal.
The part which American merchant ves­
sels and their seamen performed in the
war with Spain demands that this service,
forming both pickets and the second line
of defense, is a national necessity and
should be encouraged in every constitu­
tional way.
Details and methods for the accomplish­
ment of this purpose are discussed in the
report of the secretary of the treasury to
which the attention of congress is respect­
fully invited.
For a Yellow Fever Commission.
In my last annual message I recom­
mended that congress authorize the ap­
pointment of a commission for the pur­
pose of making systematic investigations
with reference to the cruse and prevention
of yellow fever. This matter has acquired
an increased importance as the result of
the military occupation of the island of
Cuba, and the commercial intercourse be­
tween this island and the United States,
which we have every reason to expect.
The recommendation for a commission is
earnestly renewed.
INCREASE IN THE ARMY.
A Hundred Thousand Men None Too Many
For Changed Conditions.
Under the act of congress approved
April 26,1898, authorizing the president
in his discretion upon a declaration of war
by congress, or a declaration by congress
that war exists, I directed the increase of
the regular army to the maximum of
68,000 authorized in said act. The same
act provides that in time of peace the
army shall be reduced to its original
footing.
The importanco of legislation for the
permanent increase of the army is there
fore manifest and the recommendation of
the secretary of war for that purpose has
my unqualified approval. There can be
no question that at this time and proba­
bly for some time in the future, 103,000
men will be none too many to meet the
necessities of the situation. At all events
whether that number shall be required
permanently or not the power should be
given to the president to enlist that force
if in his discretion it shall be necessary
and the further discretion should be given
him to recruit within the above limit
from the inhabitants }f the islands with
the government of which we are charged.
Would Master Oat Volunteer*.
It is my purpose to muster out the en­
tire volunteer army as soon as the con­
gress shall provide for the increase of the
regular establishment. This will be only
an act of justice and will be much appre
ceiated by the brave men who left their
homes and employments to help the coun­
try in its emergency.
INCREASE IN THE NAVY.
President Endorses the Recommendations
of the Secretary.
The following recommendations of the
secretary of the navy relative to the in­
crease the navy have my earnest ap­
proval:
1. Three sen-going and copper-sheathed
battleships of about 13,500 tons trial dis­
placement, carrying the heaviest armor
and most powerful ordnance for vessels of
their class, and to have the highest prao
ticable sized and greatest radius of action.
Estimated cosr, exclusive of armor and
armament $3,(50).000.

mored cruisers 'of about 12,000 tons dis­
placement, carrying the heaviest armor

recommending that the grades of admiral
and vice admiral be temporarily revived
to be filled with officers who have specially
distln uishod themselves in the war with
Spain.
DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE.
A Great Deal lias Been Accomplished
During the Fast Year.
The department of agriculture has been
active in the past year. Explorers havo
been sent to many of the countries of the
Eastern and Western hemispheres for
seeds and plants that may be useful to
tho United States and with tho further
view of opening up markets for our sur­
plus produets. The forestry division of
the department is giving special attention
to the treeless regions of our country and
is introducing species especially adapted to
semi-arid regions. Forest llres, which
seriously interfere with production, espe­
cially in irrigated reasons, are being stud­
ied that the losses from this cause may be
avoided. The use and abuse of water in
many states of the west and collecting in­
formation regarding the laws of the states,
the decisions of the courts and the cus­
toms of the people in this regard so that
uniformity may be secured.
Experimental stations are becoming
more valuable every year. The appropria­
tion of $702,000 by congress is supple­
mented by $100,000 from the stations.
Nation-wide experiments have been con­
ducted to ascertain the suitableness as to
soil and climate and states for growing
sugar beets. The number of sugar fac
tories has been doubled in the past two
years and the ability of the United States
to produce its own sugar from this source
has been clearly demonstrated.
Public Lands and Forest Reserves.
The public lands disposed of by the
government during the year reached
8,433,896.93 acers, an increase of 614,780 26
acres over the previous year. The total
receipts from public lands during the
fiscal year amounted to $2,277,995.18, an in­
crease of $190,063.90 over the preceding
year. The lands embraced in the 11 forest
reservations, which were suspended by
the act of June 4, 1897, again become sub­
ject to the operations of the prolama
tions of Feb. 22, 1897, creating them,
which added an estimated amount
of 19,951,300 acres to the area em­
braced in the reserves previously
creatcd. In addition thereto two new
reserves were created during the year, the
Pine Mountain and Zaca Lake reserve in
California, embracing 1,044,59-1 acres, and
the Frescott reserve in Arizona, embrac­
ing 10,220 acres, while the Pecos river re­
serve in New Mexico has been changed
and enlarged to include 120,000 additional
acres.
The department of the interior has in­
augurated a forest system, made possible
by the act of July, 1898, for a graded force
of officers in control of the reserves This
system has only been in full operation
since August, but good results have al­
ready been secured in many sections. The
reports received indicate that the system
of patrol has not only prevented destruc­
tive fires from gaining headway, but has
diminished the number of fires.
Miscellaneous Recommendations.
The president reviews the Union Pacific
and Kansas Pacific railroad matters, and
congratulates the country upon the ex­
cellent results obtained in the settlement
of bonded indebtedness of those roads.
The crowded condition of the department
of justice is referred to and better quar­
ters recommended. The inadequate ac­
commodations of the supreme court are
also referred to. The work of the post
office department in meeting the greatly
increased demands upon it consequent up­
on the state of war is warmly commended.
The Importance of early legislation pro­
viding for the taking of the Twelfth cen­
sus is urged. The condition of the pension
department is stated, but no recommen­
dations are made. The recommendations
of the commission and of the secretary
of the interior for the necessity of provid­
ing for the education of the 30,000 white
children resident' in the Indian Ter­
ritory are strongly endorsed.
Washington Would Celebrate.
In the year 1900 will occur the centen­
nial anniversary of the founding of the
city of Washington for the permanent
capital of the government of the United
States by authority of an act of congress
approved July 16, 1790.— In May, 1800, the
archives and offices of the federal govern­
ment were removed to this place. On the
17th of November, 1-00, the national
congress met here for the
first time and assumed exclusive
control of the federal district and city.
This interesting event assumes all the
more significance when we recall the cir­
cumstances attending the choosing of the
site, the naming of the capital in honor of
the father of his country, and the interest
taken by him in the adoption of plans for
its future development on a magnificent
scale.
These original plans have been wrought
out with constant progress and a signal
success even beyond their framcrs could
have foreseen. The people of the country
are justly proud of the distinctive beauty
and government of the capital and of the
rare instruments of science and education
which here And their natural home.
A movement lately inaugurated by the
citizens to have the anniversary celebrated
with fitting ceremonies including, per­
haps, the establishment of a handsome
permanent memorial to mark so historical
an occasion and give it more than local
recognition, has met with general favor
on the part of the people.
I recommend to the congress the grant­
ing of an appropriation for this purpose
and the appointment of a committee from
its respective bodies.
It m'ght a'so be advisable to authorize
the president toappoint acommittee from
the country at large, wtyich, acting with
the congressional and istrict of Colum­
bia commit, ees, can complete the plans for
«n appropriate national celebration.

OPINIONS OF THE MESSAGE.
Congressmen Commend or Criticize Ac­
cording to Political Iielief.
WASHINGTON, Dec. 7.—Expressions of
opiniou of the president's message
among members of congress vary ac­
cording to their political belief. The
Republicans express themselves in
words of commendation, declaring it an
able anil excellent document aud devoid
of boasting or vanity in reciting the
events of the war. Many Democrats
were averse to express themselves, but
the few who did found fault with a
number of points, especially the presi­
dent's views on finances and greenbacks.
His failure to outline a government for
the Philippines was also commented on.
BRITISH PRESS OPINIONS.
Tone of Disappointment in the Comments
oil the Message.
LONDON, Dec. 7.—Much having been
expected, there is a certain tone of dis­
appointment in the morning paper edi­
torials on President McKinley's mes­
sage. Its non-committal character is
attributed to the fact that the negotiar
tions of the peace commissioners at
Paris are not yet finished.
Considerable satisfaction is expressed
at the references to Anglo-American re­
lations and at the coldness displayed
toward Russia.
RALEIGH COMES HOME.
Order Significant, as Shotvlns Absence ol
Friction With Germany.
NEW YORK, Dec. 7.—A special from
Washington says: Secretary Long has
cabled orders to Rear Admiral Dewey
to send the cruiser Raleigh to the United
States. No vessel will be assigned to
relieve the Raleigh, it being the opinion
of the officials that with the addition
of the battleships and the gunboat York
town, Rear Admiral Dewey will have
an ample force at his disposal.
This order is significant as indicating
the belief of the authorities that there
is now no danger of trouble with Ger­
many over the Philippines.
MICHIGAN'S GREAT STORM.
Wire Communication Cut Off anil Traffic
at a Standstill.
DETROIT, Dec. 7.—The greatest snow
and wind storm ever known here has
kept communication by wire from this
city practically at a standstill since
Sunday night. Street car traffic has
been blocked almost completely and
general business is demoralized. Hurri­
cane signals were displayed for the first
time in the history of the lower lake
region. Tliere have been a number of
accidents and much damage to prop­
erty as a result of the blizzard.
HENRY NOW IN COMMAND.
Succeeds General Brooke aa Governor of
Porto Kico.
SAN UAN, Porto Rico, Dec. .7,—Gen­
eral Guy V. Henry,
who succeeds General
Brooke in command here, and his staif
have arrived from Ponce on board "the
United States transport Berlin, which is
bound for the United States with the
First Kentucky regiment.
General Henry, on landing, went im­
mediately to the palace, where he had a
long conversation with General Brooke,
who introduced the members of the in­
sular cabinet. These officials tendered
their resignations but General Henry
requested them to remain at their posts.
The forts saluted as the transport
passed out of the harbor. General re­
grets are expressed at General Brooke's
departure. He did excellent work here.
General Henry's coming is popular and
it is thought lie will prove an efficient
governor.
MINE KILLED FOUR.
Exploded After ft Had Keen Removed
From Hoston Harbor.
BOSTON, Dec. 7.—Four men were
killed and several severely injured at
Fort Independence, on Castle island, in
Boston harbor, by the explosion of a
mine which had been removed from the
channel by a diver. The men were en­
gaged in carting the mine from the
shore to the interior of the island to
place it with other implements of the
same nature which had been taken there
since the war.
Soldier in Dlngrace.
CLEVELAND, Dec. 7.—J. W. Perkins,
son of the lute postmaster at Collins,
Huron county, and recently a menibei
of the Fifth Ohio infantry, was arrested
for embezzlement. He obtained $815 by
draft on a New York bank, which had
money to the credit of the postoffice de­
partment, and hid his crime temporarily
by destroying the stubs of the draft.
Chicago Tlicater Partially Destroyed.
CHICAGO, Dec. 7.—Fire badly dam­
aged the Lincoln theater during the
Bight. It was thought for a time that
the building would be destroyed, but
after a hard fight the fire department
managed to save it. It is estimated
that the damage will amount to about
$60,000.
Thanks for Miss Helen Gould.
WASHINGTON, Dec. 7 General
Wheeler of Alabama introduced in the
house through Representative Stallinga
a resolution thanking Miss Helen Gould
for her patriotic devotion to the soldiers
of the army during the war and author­
izing the presentation to her of a medal
of appropriate design.

LITTLE FALLS, Minn., Dec. 7 —The
store of W. J. Sullivan at Swanville
was burglarized, the thieves getting
about $400 in cash from the safe and
also a quantity of goods, the amount of
which is not known. The safe was the

ISTAST GROWING.
Chances For a Revolution In Spain In­
creased by Leaps and Bound*.
LONDON, Dec. 7.—The Paris corre­
spondent of The Daily Telegraph says:
According to trustworthy news from
Madrid Spain is seething with sedition
born of bankruptcy and ruin. One of
the best informed men in the king­
dom assures me that the chances of rev­
olution are increasing by leaps and
bounds.
Carlism exists in three provinces only,
but the disaffection towards the existing
government is co-extensive with the en­
tire Spanish race.
Senor Groisard, minister of justice,
has called the attention of the papal
nuncio to the conduct of the clergy in
the country districts near Barcelona,
Saragossa, Pampaluna and Madrid in
openly advocating the Carlist cause
from the pulpit.
The government has ordered increased
precautions for the protection of rail­
ways in the Carlist districts.
GENERAL RELIEF IN FRANCE.
Carlist Uprising Certain the Moment MM
Trenty Is Signed.
PARIS, Dec. 7.—The belief is general
here that there will be a Carlist upris­
ing in Spain the moment the peace
treaty is signed. No one for an instant
believes, however, that the insurrection
will place the Bourbon pretender on the
throne. The French public is intensely
interested in the future of Spain. The
press urges the pretender not to plunge
the country into civil war. The Span­
ish republicans at this juncture are an
ignored quantity. It is freely admitted
that from them there is no danger, inas­
much as they are hopelessly divided.
SAGASTA'S PLAN.
Will Submit Question of Confidence
When Treaty la Signed.
MADRID, Dec. 7.—Immediately after
the signing of the treaty of peace, Senor
Sagasta, the premier, will submit to
the queen regent a question of confi­
dence. It is thought probable that her
majesty will ask Senor Sagasta to re­
main in power, in which case the cortes
Will be convoked for Jan. 7.
Wheeler Will Probably Resign.
WASHINGTON, Dec. 7.—Major General
Wheeler was a center of attraction and
congratulation when he appeared in the
house Of representatives to resume his
congressional duties. General Wheeler
said he probably would resign in the
army, but his plans were not yet defin­
itely fixed.

EARLY DEBATE ON THE# WAR
Deficiency Appropriation Bill Likely to
Open the Question.
WASHINGTON, Dec. 7.—An early de­
bate on Avar questions is expected in the
house and senate in connection with the
deficiency appropriation bill, which is
devoted exclusively to items of the army
and navy. The bill is practically com­
pleted and will be presented to the
house soon. Chairman Cannon of the
appropriation committee said he hardly
thought there would be any general
opening up of war questions just now,
though if the debate ever entered into
such questions he thought it might as
well come now as at any time.
