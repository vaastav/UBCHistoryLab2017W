A Stage-Coach Incident.

of his pedal extremities. Congressman
Daggett and the P. M. were riding in a
stage-coach, -when a funny incident hap
pened, wnicn is thus related by the M.
C:
Thestapn was considerably crowded.
Among the passengers were a lady and
little girL Hie child was so small that
her feet did not reach the floor of the
coach and she presently became very tired
and restless. Observing this, Mr. Dag
gett told the mother that the child would
be much more comfortable if she had
some support for her feet, and at the
same time informed her that under the
seat was a valise that she could draw out
which would be just the thing. The lady
reached under the seat and began tug
ging away at what she supposed to be
value.
"Can't you get it out?" said Daggett.
" Ho," said the lady: " it don t seem
to come, though I might get it if I could
find the handles."
Here Postmaster Adkinson aroused
from a doze and said: " Why, my dear
madam, you have got hold of my foot!"
Such was the actual fact. The lady,
never having seen the postmaster's "mud
cows," had no idea that what she found
under the seat could be anything else
than a big leather valise.

The Annual Message
Of President of the United
States,
States, As Communicated to the Forty-Sixth
Congress,
Touching Upon Universal Suffrage,
Universal Education,
CIVIL SERVICE REFORM, COMPETITIVE
EXAMINATIONS,
And Our Amicable Relations With Foreign
Governments.
FeUow-Citizens of (he Senate and Boute of
Representatives: I congratulate yon on the
continued and increasing prosperity of our
country. By the favor of Divine Providence
we have been blessed, during the past year
with health, with abundant harvests, with
profitable employment for all our people, and
with contentment at home, and with peace and
friendship with other nations. -,
The occurrence of the twenty-fourth election
of Chief Magistrate has afforded another op
portunity to the people of the United States to
exhibit to the world a significant example of the
peaceful and safe transmission of the power and
authority of government from the public serv
ants whose terms of office are about to expire,
to their newly chosen successors. This exam
ple can not fail to impress profoundly thought
ful people of other countries with the advan
tages which Republican institutions afford.
The immediate, general and cheerful acquies
cence of all good citizens in the result of the
election, gives gratifying assurance to our coun
try, and to friends throughout the world, that
a Government based on the free consent of an
intelligent and patriotic people, possesses ele
ments of strength, stability, and permanency
not found in any other form of government.
THE ELECTIVE FRANCHISE.
en
joyment of the rights of citizenship, conferred
npon the colored people by the recent amend
ments to the Constitution, still prevails in sev
eral of the late slaveholding States. It has, per
haps, not been manifested in the recent election
to any large extent in acts of violence or intim
idation. It has, however, by fraudulent prac
tices in connection with the ballots, with the
regulations as to the places and manner of vot
ing, and with counting, returning, and canvass
ing the votes cast, been successful in defeating
the exercise of the right preservative of all
rights, the right of suffrage, which the Consti
tution expressly confers upon our enfranchised
citizens.
It is the desire ot the good people of the
whole country that sectionalism as a factor in
our politics should disappear. They prefer that
no section of the country should be united in
solid opposition to any other section. The dis
position to refuse a prompt and hearty obedi
ence to the equal-rights ' amendments to the
Constitution, is all that now stands in the way
of a complete obliteration of sectional lines in
our political contests. As long as either of
these amendments iB flagrantly violated or dis
regarded, it is safe to assume that the people
who placed them in the Constitution, as
embodying the legitimate results of the
war for the Union, and who believe them
to be wise and necessary, will continue to act
together, and to insist that they shall be
obeyed. The paramount quostion still is, as
to the enjoyment of tho right by every Ameri
can citizen who has the requisite qualifications,
to freely cast his vote and have it honeitly
counted. With this question rightly settled,
the country will be relieved of tho contentions
of the past; bygones will indeed be bygones;
and political and party issues with respect t
economy and efficiency of administration, in
ternal improvements, the tariff, domestic tax
ation, eduaetion, finance and other important
subjects, will then receive their full Bhore of
attention; but resistance to, and nullifica
tion of, the results of the war will unite
together' in- resolute purpose for then
support all who maintain the authority
of the Government and the perpetuity
of the Union, and who adequately appreciate
the value of the victory achieved. This de
termination proceeds from no hostile senti
ment or feeling to any part of the people of
our country, or to any of their interests. The
inviolability of the amendments rests upon the
fundamental principle of our Government.
They are the solemn expression of the will of
the people of the United States.
THE FIFTEENTH AMENDMENT.
The sentiment that the constitutional rights
of all our citizens must be maintained, does not
grow weaker. It will continue to control the
Government of the country. Happily, the his
tory of the late election shows that many parte
of the country where opposition to the Fifteenth
Amendment has hitherto prevailed, it is dimin
ishing, and is likely to cease altogether, if firm
and well-considered action is taken by Con
gress. I trust the House of Representatives
and the Senate, which have a right to judge
of the elections, returns and qualifications
of thoir own members, will see to it that every
case of violation of the letter or spirit of the
viiteontn Amendment is tnorouemy investi
gated, and that no benefit from such violation
Bnaii accrue to any person or party, it will
be the duty of the Executive, with sufficient
appropriations for the purpose, to prosecute
unsparingly all who have been engaged in de
priving citizens of the rights guaranteed to
them by the Oonotitntion.
A POPULAR EDUCATION NEEDED.
a
a
It is not. however, to be fore-tten that the
best and surest guarantee of the primary rights
of citizenship is to be found in that capacity for
self-protection which can belong only to a peo
ple whose right to universal suffrage is sup-
ponea Dy universal eancauon. rne means at
the command of the local and State authorities
are, in many cases, wholly inadequate to fur
nish free instruction to all who need it. This
is especially true where, before emancipation.
the education of the people was neglected or
prevented, in the interest of slavery. Firmly
convinced that the subject of popular educa
tion deserves the earnest attention of the peo
ple of the whole country, with a view to wise
and comprehensive action by the Government
of the United States, I respectfully recommend
that Congress, by suitable legislation and with
proper safeguards, supplement the local educa
tional funds in the several States where the
grave duties and responsiomues or citizonsnip
have been devolved on uneducated people, by
devotine to the purpose Krauts of public lands.
and, if necessary, by appropriations from the
Treasury of the united btates. WnatevorGov
eroment can fairly do to promote free popular
education ought to be done. Wherever general
education is found, peace, virtue, and social
order prevail, and civil and religious liberty are
THE CIVIL SERVICE.
of
In my former annual messenges, I have asked
the attention of Congress to the urgent neces
sity of a reformation of the civil service system
of the Government. My views concerning the
dangers of patronage, or appointments for
personal or partisan considerations, have been
strengthened by my observation and experience
in the Executive office, and I believe these
dangers threaten the stability of the Govern
ment. Abuses so serious in their nature can
not be permanently tolerated. They tend
become more alarming with the enlargement
administrative service, as the growth of the
country in population increases the number
officers and placemen employed.
The reasons are imperative for the adoption
of fixed rules for the regulation of appointment,
promotions and removals, establishing
a uniform method, having exclusively in view,
in every instance, the attainment of the best
qualifications for the position in question.
Buch a method alone is consistent with the
equal rights of all citizens, and the most
ffiOTiormc1 and efflefcrit sdmlniatration of the
COMPETITIVE EDUCATION.
examinations, m aid of impar
tial appointments and promotions, have been
conducted for some years past in several of the
Executive Departments, and by my direction
this system has been adopted in the custom
houses and postoffices of the larger cities of
the country. In the City of New York ovet
two thousand positions in the civil service have
been subject in their appointments and tenure
of place, to the operation of published rules
for this purpose, during the past two years.
The results of these practical trials have been
very satisfactory, and have confirmed my opin
ion in favor of this system of selection. All
are subjected to the same tests, and the result
is free from prejudice by personal favor or par
tisan influence. It secures for the position ap
plied for, the best qualifications attainable
among the competing applicants. It is an ef
fectual protection from the pressure of impor
tunity which, under any other course pursued,
largely exacts the time and attention of ap
pointing'ofncerH, to their great detriment in the
discharge of other official duties, preventing
the abnsef the service for the mere further
ance of private or party purposes, and leaving
the employ of the Government, freed from the
obligations imposed by patronage, to depend
solely upon merit for retention and advance
ment, and with this constant incentive, exertion
and improvement.
These invaluable results have been attained
in a high degree in the offices where the rules
for appointment by competitive examination
have been applied.
A method which has so approved itself by
experimental tests at points where such testg
may be fairly considered conclusive, should be
extended to all subordinate positions under th6
Government. I believe that a strong and
growing public sentiment demands immediate
measures for securing and enforcing the high
est possible efficiency in the Civil Service, and
its protection from recognized abuses, and that
the experience referred to has demonstrated
the feasibility of such measures.
The examinations in the Custom-Houses and
Pojtoffices have been held under many embar
rassments and without provision for compensa
tion for the extra labor performed by the offi
cers who have conducted them, and whose com
monable interest in the improvement of the
public service has induced this devotion of time
and labor without pecuniary reward. A con
tinuance of these labors gratuitonsly ought not
to be expected, and without an appropriation
by Congress for compensation, it is not practic
ble to extend the system of competitive ex
aminations generally throughout the Civil Ser
vice. It is also highly important that all such
examinations should be conducted upon
a uniform system, and under general
supervision. Section 1,753 of the Revised
Statutes authorizes the President to prescribe
the regulations for admission to the Civil Ser
vice of the United States, and for this purpose
to employ suitaue perrons to conduct tne re
quisite inquiries with reference to "the fitness
of each candidate, in respect to age, health,
character, knowledge, and ability, for the
branch of service into which he seeks to enter;"
but the law is practically inoperative for want
ol tne requisite appropriation.
1 therefore recommend an appropriation ol
$25,000 per annum to meet the expenses of a
commission, to be appointed by the President
in accordance with the terms of this section,
whose duty it shall be to devise a just, uniform,
and efficient system ot competitive examina
tions, and to supervise the application of the
same throughout the entire civil service of the
Government. I am persuaded that the facul
ties which such a commission will afford for
testin? the fitness of those who atrnlv for
office will not only be as welcome a relief to members
of Congress as it will be to the President
and heads of Deportments, but that it will also
greatly tend to remove the causes of embarrass
ment wmcn now lnevitauiy and constantly at
tend the conflicting claims of patronage be
tween the legislative and executive, departments.
THE "SPOILS SYSTEM."
The most serious obstacle, however, to an im
provement of the civil service, and especially to
a reform in the method of appointment and re
moval, has been found to be the practice, under
what is known as the "spoils system," by which
the appointing power has been so largely en
croached upon by members of Congress. The
first step in the reform of the civil service must
be a complete divorce between Congress and
the Executive in the matter of appointments.
The corrupting doctrine that "to the victors be
long the spoils" is inseparable from Congres
sional patronage as the established rule and
practice of parties in - power. It comes
to be understood by applicants for office,
and by the people generally, that Representa
tives aud Senators are entitled to disburse the
patronage of their respective districts N and
States. It is not necessary to recite at length
the evils resulting from this invasion of tho
Executive functions. The true principles of
government on the subject of appointments to
office, as stated in the National Conventions of
the leading parties of the country, have again
and again been approved by the American peo
pleand have not been called in question in any
quarter. These authentic expressions of pub
lic opinion upon this all-important subject,
the statement of principles that belong to the
constitutional structure of the Government.
It is therefore recommended that an act be
passed defining the relations of members
Congress with respect to appointment to office
by the President, and I also recommend that
the provisions of Section 1,767, and of the sec
tions following, of the Revised Statutes, com
prising the tenure-or-omce act or Morcn 2, 1S67,
be reoealed.
Believing that to reform the system and
methods of the civil service in our country
one of the highest and most imperative duties
of statesmanship, and that it can be perma
nently done only by the oo-operation of the
legislative and executive departments of the
Uovernment. 1 again commend the wnole sub
ject to your considerate attention.
POLYGAMY.
The Mormon sectarian organization which
nnholds Domramv has the whole Dower of mak
ing and executing the local legislation of the
Territory. By its control of the grand and
petit juries, it possesses large influence over
the administration of justice. Excorosing,
the heads of this sect do, the local political
power of the Territory, they are able
make effective their hostility to the law of Con
gress on the Bubject of polygamy, and, in fact,
do prevent its enforcement. Polygamy will not
be abolished if the enforcement of the law de
pends on those who practice and uphold the
crime. It con only be suppressed by taking
away the political power of the sect winch encourages
and sustains it. It controls now one
of our wealthiest and most populous Territo
ries. It is extending steadily into other Terri
tories. Wherever it goes it establishes polyg
amy and sectarian political power. Keligious
liberty and the separation of Church and State
are among tne elementary ideas of free insti
tutions. To re-establish the interests and nrin.
ciples which polygamy and Hormonism have
imperiled, and to fully reopen to intelligent
and virtuous immigrants of all creeds that part
of our domain which has been, in a great de
gree, closed to general immigration by intoler
ant and immoral institutions, it is recom
mended that the Government of the Territory
of Utan be reorganised.
- I recommend that Congress provide for the
Government of Utah by a Governor and judges.
or commissioners, appointed by the President
and confirmed by the Senate a government
analogous to the Provisional Government estab
lished for the Territory northwest of the Ohio,
by the ordinance of 1787. If, however, it
deemed best to continue the existing form
local government, I recommend that the right
to vote, hold ofhee, and sit on juries in
Territory of Utah, be confined to those who
neither Dractice nor nnhold nolveamv. If thor
ough measures are adopted, it is believed that
witiun a lew years tne evils wmcn now anuct
Utah will be eradicated.
FORTUNE BAY INJURIES.

Our relations with all foreign ooun tries have
been those of undisturbed peace, and have pre
sented no occasion tor concern as ui uieir vou
tinued maintenance.
Within a few weeks I have received a com
munication from Her Maiestv's Government.
renewing the consideration of the subject, both
of the indemnity for the injuries at Fortune
Bay, and of the interpretation of the treaty
which the previous correspondence had shown
the two Governments to be at variance. Unon
both these topics the disposition towards
friendly agreement is manifested by a recogni
tion of our right to an indemnity for
transaction at Fortune Bay, leaving the measure
oi such indemnity to iurtner conference, and
by an assent the view of this Government.
S resented in the previous correspondence, that
le regulation of conflicting interests of
shore fishery of the Provincial sea coasts,
the vessel fishery of our fishermen, should
made the subject of conference and concurrent
arrangement between the two Governments.
OUR FOREIGN RELATIONS.
The state of peace and tranquillity now
Joyed by all the nations of the continent
Europe has its favorable influence upon our
and commercial relations with them.
A Congress to consider means for the protection
of indnstrial property has recently been in ses
sion in Paris, to which I have appointed
"' ' ' " " 1 ' " iiiiV-1Uiirr'fVPt.tHrfij
in Belgium as delegates. The Interna tion Com
mission upon Weights and Measures also con
tinues its work in Paris. I invite your atten
tion to the necessity of an appropriation to be
mode in time to ejiable this Government to
comply with its obligations undor the Metrical
Convention.
Our friendly relations with the German Em
pire continue without interruption. At the re
cent International Exhibition of Fish and Fish
eries at Berlin, the participation of the United
States was extremely successful and meritori
ous, winning for private exhibitors numerous
swords of a high class, and for the country at
large the principal prize of honor offered
by His Majesty the Emperor.
There is nothing of importance to note in our
unbroken friendly relations with the Govern
ments of Austria-Hungary, Bnssio, Portugal,
Sweden and Norway, Switzerland, Turkey and
Greece.
THE SPANISH OUTRAGE.
During the last summer several vessels be
longing to the merchant marine of this country,
sailing in neutral waters of the West Indies,
were bred at, boarded, and searched by an armed
cruiser of the Spanish Government. The cir
cumstances, os reported, involve not only o
private injury to the persons oonccrned, but
also seemed too little observant of the friendly
relations existing for a century between this
country and Spain. The wrong was brought
to the attention of the Spanish Government in
a serious protest and remonstrance, and the
matter is undergoing investigation by the royal
authorities, with a view to such explanations or
reparations as may be called for by the facts.
THE FLORIDA TREATY.
The claims against the United States under
the Florida Treaty with Spain were submitted
to Congress for its action at the late sestdon,
aud I again invite your attention to this long
standing question, with a view to a final dis
position of the matter.
OUR CHINESE RELATIONS
The provision made by Congress, at its last
session, for the expense of the commission
which had been appointed to enter upon
negotiations with the Imperial Government of
China, on subjects of great interest to the rela
tions ct the two countries, enabled tne uom
mi3sioncrs to proceed at once upon their mis
sion. Tho Imperial Government was prepared
to give prompt and respectful attention to the
matters brought under negotiation, and the
conferences proceeded with such rapidity and
success that on the 17th of November last,
'wo treaties were signed at Pekin, one relating
to the introduction of Chinese into this country
and one relating to commerce. Mr. Trescot,"
one of the Commissioners, is now on his way
homo bringing the treaties, and it is expected
that they will be received in season to be laid
before the Senate early in January.
Our Minister in Japan has negotiated a con
vention for the reciprocal relief of shipwrecked
seamen. I take occasion to urge once more
upon Congress the propriety of making pro
vision for the erection of suitable fire-proof
buildingB at the Japanese Capital lor tne use or
the' American Legation, and the Court-house
and Jail connected with it. The Japanese
Government, with great generosity and
courtesy, hag offered for this purpose an eligi
ble piece of land.
In my last annual message I invited the at-
tention of Congress to the subject of the in-'
demnity funds received some years ago from
Cuma and Japan. 1 renew tne recommenda
tion then made that whatever portion of these
funds ore due to American citizens should be
promptly paid, and the residue returned to the
nations, respectively, to which they justly and
equitably belong.
REAFFIRMING THE "MONROE DOCTRINE" RESPECTING
THE PANAMA CANAL SCHEME.
The relations between this Government and
that of the United States of Colombia have en
gaged public attention during the pout year,
mainly by reason of the project of an inter
oceamc canal across the Isthmus of Panama, to
be built by private capital under a concession
from the Colombian Government for that pur
pose. The treaty obligations subsisting between
tho United States and Colombia, by which we
guarantee the neutrality of tho transit and the
sovereignty and property of Colombia in the
Isthmus, make it necessary that the conditions
under wmcn so stupendous o cnange in tne
region embraced in this guarantee should be
effected transforming, as it would, this Isth
mus, from a barrier between the Atlantic and
Pacific Oceans, into o'gateway and thorough
fare between them, for the navies and tho mer
chant ships of the world should receive the
approval of this Government, as being com
patible with the discharge of theBe obligations
ou our part, ana consistent wnn our luwreiiia
as tho principal commercial power of the West
ern Hemisphere. The views which I expressed
in a special message to congress in uarcn last,
in relation to this project, I deem it my duty
again to press upon your attention. Subse
quent consideration has but confirmed the opin
ion "that it is tho right and dirty of the United
States to assert and maintain such provision
and authority over any mter-oceanio canal
across the Isthmus that connects North and
South America as will protect our national in
terest.

readiness to aid in accommodating their differ

both belligerents of our willingness to render

The prosperous energies of our domestic in
dustries, and their immense production of the
subjects of foreign commerce, invite, and even
require, an active development of tho wishes
and interests oi our people in that direction.
Especially important is it that our commercial
relations with the Atlantic and Pacific coasts of
South America, with the West Indies, and the
Gulf of Mexico should be direct, and not
through the circuit of European systems, and
should be carried on in our own bottoms. The
full appreciation of the opportunities which
our rront on tne 1'acmc Ucean gives to com
merce with Japan, China, and the East Indies.
with Australia and the Island groups which lie
along these routes of navigation, should in
spire equal efforts to appropriate to our own
snipping, and to administer by our own capital,
a due proportion of this trade. Whatever mod
ifications of our regulations of trade and navi
gation may be necessary or useful to meet
and direct these impulses to the enlargement of
our exchanges and or our carrying trade, I am
sure the wisdom of Congress will be ready to
snppiy. one initial measure, however, seems to
me so clearly useful and efficient that I venture
to press it npon your earnest attention.
It seems to be very evident that the
provision of regular steam-postal communica
tion, by aid from Government, has been the
forerunner of the commercial predominance of
Great Britain on all these coasts and seas,
greater shore in whose trade is now the desire
and the intent of our people. It is also mani
fest that the efforts of other European nations
to contend with Great Britain for a share
this commerce, hove been successful in propor
tion with their adoption of regular steam
postal communication with the markets whose
trade they sought. Mexico and the States
South America ore anxious to receive such
postal communications with this country, and
to aid in their development. Similar co-operation
may be looked for, in due time, from the
Eastern nations and from Australia. It is diffi
cult to see how the lead in this movement can
be expected from private interests. In respect
of foreign postal commerce, quite as much
in internal trade, communication seems neces
sarily a matter of common and public adminis
tration, and thus pertaining to government.
respectfully recommend to your prompt atten
tion such just and efficient measures as may
conduce to the development of our foreign com
mercial exchanges and the building up of our
carrying trade.

The condition of the financial affairs of the
Government, as shown by the report of the
Secretary of the Treasury, is very sotisf actorv.
It is believed that the present financial situation
of the United States, whether considered with
currency, credit, growing
ana vsrieiv or our
other country of our time, ana has never been
surpassed by that of any country at any period
of its history. All our industries are thriving;
the rate of interest is low; new railroads are be
ing constructed; a vast immigration is increas
ing our population, capital and labor; new en
terprises in great number are in progress; and
our commercial relations with other countries
are improving. .

to $350,000,000, which will be sufficient to meet

leave a Burplus of $90,000,000.
It is fortunate that this large surplus revenue
occurs at a period when it may be directly ap
plied to the payment of the public debt soon to
be redeemable.
The debt of the United States, less cash in
the Treasury and exclusive of accruing interest,
attained its maximum of 2,756,431,571.43 in
August, 1865, and bos since that time been re

that the silver dollar authorized by the bill con

and considerable expense has been necessarily
incurred for this purpose, but its return to the
Treasury is prompt and sure, contrary to me
confident anticipation of the friends of the
measure at the tune of its adoption, the value
nt tia Hilvnr Hollar, containing 412W eroins
silver, has not increased. During the year
prior to the passage or the bill authorizing
minora, the market value of the silver which
it contained was from ninety to ninety-two
cents, as compared with the standard gold dol
lr Tmrine the last year the overage market
value of the silver dollar has been eighty-eight
and a half cents.
Tt obvious that the legislation of the last
Congress in regard to silver, so far as it was
based on an anticipated rise in the value
silver as o result of that legislation, has failed
to produce the enect men preaiciea. aiio
longer the low remains in force, requiring as
does, the coinage of a nominal dollar which,

the danger that this country will be forced

of value, in circulation, and this o standard

The Constitution of the United States, sound

will, in my judgment, contribute to this result
if Congress will repeal so much of existing leg
islation as requires the coinage of silver dollars
containing only 412. grains of silver, and
its Bteod will authorize the Secretary of
Treasury to coin silver dollars of equivalent
value as bullion, with gold dollars. This
defraud no man, and will be in accordance with
familiar precedents. Congress, on several oc
casions, has altered the ratio of value between
gold and silver, in order to establish it more
nearly in accordance with the actual ratio
value between metals.
MILITARY POSTS.
The rapid extension of the railroad system
west of the Mississippi River, and the groat
tide of settlers which has flowed in upon
territory, impose on the military an entire
change of policy. The maintenance of small
posts along wagon and stage routes of travel
no longer necessary. Permanent quarters
than those heretofore constructed, will be re
quired. Under existing laws, permanent build
ings can not be erected without the sanction of
Congress, and when soles of military sites and
buildings have been authorized, the moneys re
ceived have reverted to the Treasury," and
could oniy become ovanaoie through a new
appropriation. It is recommended that provi
sion be made, by a general statute, for the sole
of such abandoned military posts and buildings
ss ore found to be unnecessary, and for the ap-
luwauon oi tne proceeds to tne construc
tion of other post8- While many of the nres-
ent posts are of but slight value for military
purposes, owing to tne changed condition ol
the country, their occupation is continued at
great expense and inconvenience, because they
afford the only available shelter for troops.
ARMY EDUCATIONAL FACILITIES.
The report of the officer in chanre of educa
tion in the army shows that there ore seventy
eight schools now in operation in the army,
with an aggregate attendance of 2,305 enlisted
men and children. The Secretary recommends
the enlistment of one hundred and fifty school
masters, witn tne rano and pay oi commissary
sergeants. An appropriation is needed to sup
ply the judge advocates of the army with snita
able libraries, and the Secretary recommends
that the corps of judge advocates bo placed
npon the samo footing, as to promotion, with
the other staff corps of the army. Under ex
isting laws, the Bureau of Military Justice con
sists of one officer, the Judge Advocate Gen
eral, and the corps of judge advocates, of eight
officers of equal rank (majors) with a provision
mat tne limit oi tne corps uau remain at lour,
when reduced by casualty or resignation to that
number. The consolidation of the Bureau of
Military Justice and the corps of judge advo
cates, upon the same basis with the other staff
corps of the army, would remove an unjust dis
crimination against deserving officers, and sub-
servo the best interests ot the service.
COAST FORTIFICATIONS.
Especial attention is asked to the report of
the Chief of Engineers upon the coudition of
our National defences. From a personal in
spection of many of the fortifications referred
to, the Secretary is able to emphasize the rec
ommendations mode, and to state that their in
complete and defenceless condition is discredit
able to the country. While other nations have
been increasing in their means for carrying on'
offensive warfare and attacking maritime cities,
we have been dormant in preparation for de
fense; nothing of importance has been done to
wards strengthening aud finishing our casemat
ed works since our late civil war, during which
the great guns of modern warfare and the
heavy armor of modern fortifications and ships
came into use among the nations, and our
earthworks left, by s sudden failure of appro
priations some years since, in all stagea of in
completion, are now being rapidly destroyed by
the elements.
NAVIGATION.
A comprehensive improvement of the Missis
sippi and its tributaries is a matter of trans
ceudant importance. Geographically, commer
cially, and politically, they ore the strongest tie
between the various sections of the country.
These channels of communication and inter
change are the property of the Nation. Its ju
risdiction is paramount over then- waters, and
the plainest principles of public interest require
their intelligent and careful supervision, with
a view to their protection, improvement! and
the enhancement ol their usefulness.
The channel of the Columbia River, for a dis
tance or about one hundred miles from its
mouth, is obstructed by a succession of bars,
which occasion serious delays in navigation,
and heavy expense for lighterage and towage.
A depth of at least twenty feet at low tide
should be secured and maintained, to meet the
requirements of the extensive and growing in
land ana ocean commerce it subserves.
From Columbia River to San Francisco.

harbor on our Pacifio coast which can be ap
proached during stormy weather. An appro

fifth Congress for the commencement of i

at some point between tho Straits of Fuco and

I commend the matter to the attention of Congress.

A QUIET HINT.
I commend to the attention of Congress the
great services of the Commander-in-Chief of
our armies during the war for the Union,
whose wise, firm and patriotic conduct did so
much to bring that momentous conflict to o
close. The legislation of tho United States con
tains many precedents for the recognition of
distinguished military merit, authorizing rank
and emoluments to be conferred for eminent
services to the country. An act of Congress
authorizing the appointment of a Captain Gen
eral of the Army, with suitable provisions re
lating to compensation, retirement, ond other
details, would, in my judgement, be altogether
fitting and proper, and would be warmly ap
proved by the country.

of

ment of some form of civil government for the
people of Alaska, is approved. At present
there is no protection of persons or property in
that Territory, except such as is afforded by
the officer of the United States ship Jamestown.
This vessel was dispatched to Sitka, because of
the fear that, without the immediate presence
of the National authority, there was impending
danger of anarchy. The steps taken to restore
order have been accepted in good faith by both
white and Indian inhabitants, ond the necessity
for this method of restraint does not in my
opinion now exist. If, however, the James
town should be withdrawn, leaving the people,
as at present, without the ordinary judicial
and administrative authority of organized
local government, serious consequences might
ensue.

suitable, both as regards our naval purposes
and the uses of commerce, have been selected,

INDIAN AFFAIRS.
It eives me great measure to say that our In
dian affairs appear to be in a mors hopeful con
dition now than ever before. The Indians
hove mode gratifying progress in agriculture,
herding and mecnauical pursuits. Many who
were o few years ago in hostile conflict with the
uovernment are quietly settling down on iarma
where they hope to make thoir permanent
homes, building houses and engaging in the oc
cupations of civilized life. The introduction of
the freighting business among them has been
remarkably fruitful of good results, in giving
many of them congenial and remunerative em-
luuyiuvuv, KI1U u fvuiiuieuii(5 IW vuiwjuvu w
earn their own support. Their honesty, fidelity
and efficiency as carriers are highly praised.
The organization of a police force of Indians,
has been eoually successful in maintainiug law
and order upon the reservations, and in exercis
ing o wholesome moral influence among the In
dians themselves. I concur with the Secretary
of the Interior in the recommendation that the
pay of this force be increased, as an inducement
to the best class of young men to enter it.
Mnch care ond attention has been devoted to
the enlargement of educational faculties for
the Indians. The means available for this im
portant object have been very inadequate. A
few additional boardine-ecbools at Indian agen
cies have been established, and the erection of
buildings has been begun for several more, but
an increase ot the appropriations for this in
teresting undertaking is greatly needed to ac
commodate the large number oi Indian cnua
ren of school age. The nnmbes of Indian pu
pils at the Normal 8chool at Hampton, Virgin
ia, itnder the direction of General Armstrong,
has been considerably increased, and their pro
gress is highly encouraging. The Indian school
MtuhliHhed bv the Interior Denortment in 1879.
at Carlisle, Pennsylvania, under the direction
of Captain Pratt, has been equally successful.
A similar school was established this year at
Forest Grove, Oregon, lor the education oi in
dim youth on the Pacifk) coast.
The sinenses of Indian eiucation have so
for been drawn from the permanent civilization
fund at the disposal of the Department of the
Interior; but the fund is now so mnch reduced,
that the continuance of this beneficial work
will in the future depend on speciflo appropri
ations by Congress for the purpose, ond I ven
ture to express the hope that Congress will not
permit institutions so lrmuui ui u lauua,
to perish for wont of means for their support.
The mat year has been unusually free from
disturbances among the Indian tribes. An
agreement has heen made with tho Utes by
which they surrender their large reservation in
Colorado in consideration of an annuity, to be
paid to them, and agree to settle in severalty
on certain lands designated for that purpose, as
farmers, holding individual title to that land
in fee-simple, inalienable lor a certain period.
In this way a costly Indian war has been avoid
ed. The conduct of the Indians throughout
the
e country, during the past year, with but few
iteworthyeiceptions, has "been orderly and
no
peaceful.
THE PUBLIC LANDS.
A large increase is reported in the disposal
or public lands tor settlement aunng we post
year, which marks the prosperous growth of
our agricultural industry, and a vigorous
movement of population toward our unoccupied
lands. As this movement proceeds, the codifi
cation of our land laws, os well as proper leg
islation to regulate the disposition of public
lands, become of more Dressing necessity, and
I therefore invito the consideration of Con-
ra to the renort made by the Publio Lands
Commission, which were communicated by me
to Congress at tne last session, tarry acuou
unon this imtmrtant subject is highly desirable.
Tho attention of Congress is again asked to
the wasteful depredations oommittod on our
public timber lands, and the rapid and inrlb-
cnminate destruction oi our ioresu. iim
urgent necessity for legislation to this end is
now rpnorallv recoEnized. In view of the law-
lefts characters of the depredations committed.
and the disastrous consequences which will in
evitably follow their continuance, legislation
has again and again been recommended to ar
rant the eviL and to preserve for the people of
our Western States and Territories the timber

MORE PUBLIC BUILDINGS WANTED.
The Secretary of the Interior asks attention
to the want of room in the oublie buildings of
the capital, now existing ana in progress oi

clerical force employed, and of the publio
records. Necessity has compelled the renting
of private buildings in different parte of the

while the separation of offices belonging to the

the east, north, and west, be purchased as the
sites for new edifices, for the accommodation
the Government offices, leaving the square it
self intact; and that, It ancn buuaings

In my annual messages heretofore, I have
urged upon the attention of Congress the
cessity of reclaiming ths marshes of the Po
tomac adjacent to the Capital, and I am con
strained by its importance to advert to
subject. These flats embrace on area of several
hundred acres. They are an impediment
the drainage of the city, and seriously impair
its health. It is believed that, with this sub
stantial improvement of its river front,
Capitol would be, in all respects, one of
most attractive cities in the world.
It should not be forgotten that ths land
acquired will probably be worth the cost of
it, and that the navigation of
river will be greatly improved. I therefore

EXECUTIVE MANSION, December 6. 1880.
He Couldn't Help It.
I
Here is another case of a boy who
couldn't help it. A prominent and dig
nified citizen was Joooking tnrongn tne
third-story window ot a block on Jeffer-
sou avenue, winch no bad thoughts oi
renting, when the idea suddenly struct
Inm to look into the alley in tne rear.
He raised the sash of a window and
peered out npon ash boxes, coal scuttles)
mid barrels of straw without number, and
was about to close his observations when
the sash came down with a thud and
atruck him behind the shoulders. In hia
fright he fell to his knees, and while the
solid hall of his body was oil right the
lighter was over the window silL In ad
dition to the weight of the sash any
movement of the body was accompanied
by pain. The sash could not be reached
with his hands freely enough to lift it.
and it soon occurred to the prominent
citizen that he ought to have help. He
could not expect it from . behind, for he
was alone in the store, but as He looked
down into the alley a boy came stomping
along to find something worth logging
away.
"Hello, boy! hello I" called the ciU-
zen.
" Hello yourself !" cned the boy as he
looked up.
"Say, boy, come under the window
here; I want to speak to yon."
Not much, yer don t, cnucuea tne
gamin. ' xou can t drop no com sctitues
on my bead.
" Bat I don t mean to.
Mebbe not, but you've got a bad face
on you for all that When did you get
out of the jug?
"Boy, I wan t your help.
"So does your aunt 1 Don't get me
to stand in with no such duffer as' you
are!"
I am caught in this window and want
to get out" -s. . :
' Ho would X I Heen prospecting lor
old junk, eh? You'll get six months for
that!"
" If youll come up stairs and help me
out I'll give you a dollar !"
" A dollar I Xou can t play no dollar
store on me, old man 1 If you make up
another face like that at me I U hit you
in the eve with this old lemon. 1 don't
ook starched up, but I don't let any man
4nRu th'm6 -
insult me all the same."
"Don't you know who I am?"
softly
asked the citizen.
" Naw, I don't; but 111 bet the perlece
dol You've got one of the hardest mugs
on you I ever saw, and I've a good mind
to give you one just lor iuck i ajoos out
now."
He made as if he would throw, and
the citizen dodged. This was such fun
for the boy that he kept it up for three
or four minutes, and the offer of $2 had
no effect on him.. Then be gathered six
or eight old lemons and oranges together
and said:
" I believe you are the boss hyena who
knocked dad down at the caucus, and
I'm going to drive your nose back ex
actly an men r - ,
" If you throw at me 111 call the po
lice 1" exclaimed the citizen. -
" The sooner ye call the sooner yeTl
be jugged ! Here's to hit you square on
the nose r
The opening of the back door of a
store and the appearance of a man dis
concerted the lad's aim, and the lemon
struck the citizen's hat instead of his
nose. Hia yells brought a climax, but
the air was full of tropical fruit even as
the txty dusted down the alley and turned
a corner.
The boy couldn t help acting that way.
He was born so. He wouldn't have been
a bit like a boy to run up stairs and re
leased the man. He didn't have a fair
chanoe with his spoiled lemons, but boys
soon get over disappointments. Detroit
