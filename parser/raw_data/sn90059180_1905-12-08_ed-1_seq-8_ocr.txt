Alaska's gold produce for 190£ would
pay twice over th© $7,200,000 which we
gave for that providence to Russia.
And this is only one item in our an­
nual income from that region.
Dr. Biger, of Warsaw, a Jewish doc­
tor in the Russian army, who is at
present a prisoner of war in Japan,
has! been elected an honorary member
of a scientific section of the University
of Tokyo.
In 1880 North Carolina had only 49
mills, consuming 28,000 bales of cot­
ton. To-day she owns 250 mills, con­
suming 550,000 bales. North Carolina
•hows an Increase of 197 per cent in
(he value of her manufactured prod­
uct, as compared with Massachusetts'
11 per cent.
A unique part of the law passed by
the last session of the Wisconsin leg­
islature compelling agriculture to be
taught In all country schools is that
women teachers In rural districts will
have to tell the farmer's son how to
till the soil and what soil is the best
tor certain plants.
Every three years all Chinese dom­
iciled in Siam have to pay a small
poll tax. When this has been paid the
collector tie® a string around the
man's left wrist and fastens the knot
with a special official seal. The brace­
let is the Chinaman's receipt and
must be worn one month.
It Is not generally known that re
cently there have been made on the
German military railway between Ber­
lin and Zossen some experiments
which demonstrate the applicability of
wireless telegraphy to the operation of
railways, and its undoubted usefulness
as a means of preventing disasters.
Whatever attitude congress may
take toward the question of the hold­
ing of an exposition in Seattle in 1907
to celebrate the 40 anniversary of the
annexation of Alaska, that project is
calculated to arouse a good deal of
popular interest. The object is to dis­
play the vast and varied resources of
Alaska, to thus interest the people
of the United States and the world in
that region.
An ingenious Russian nas invented
an apparatus for destroying Injurious
insects by electricity. A dynamo is
eo placed upon a handcar that elec­
tricity is generated when the car is
in motion. The current passes into
the ground through the iron wheels
upon one side and the points of brush­
es of copper wire upon the other. All
Insects in the vicinity are killed, as if
toy lightning.
A unique idea in automobile trans­
portation, the invention of Russell
Thayer, of Philadelphia, is a machine
which will run on the trolley car
tracks, with electricity stored in its
own storage battery, at the will of its
op'erator. That the device is entirely
practical Is evidenced by .the fact that
such a vehicle was successfully oper­
ated here as an experiment for one
day recently by a special arrangement
with the Rapid Transit company.
In 1904 only 656 immigrants went to
Georgia, North and South Carolina,
while 58,411 went to Massachusetts.
We can easily use a million immi­
grants a year, but we can not use them
all in one place. By far too many re­
main in New York City. At but a
trifling expense a bureau could be
maintained at each of our immigra­
tion ports, equipped with full informa­
tion, and in many cases with free
transportation to places ready for the
new workers.
In the opinion of several physicians
eleven-year-old Leo Shields, of No. 119
West Maple avenue, Denver, Col., pos
eesses the most wonderful throat and
neck in Denver. While playing in
Union park the little fellow ran into
& three-inah iron pipe rail. The bar­
rier caught him squarely on the throat.
So great was the impact that the se­
curely supported pipe broke squarely
off as the lad crashed through. The
iboy lay groaning on the ground, and
Denver university football players
rushed to his aid. The cartilage,
which was wrenched out of place, was
fixed and the lad -picked himself up
and scampered home.
The citizens of Bessemer, Ala., are
very much interested in what is
claimed to be the oldest living couple
in the United States. The husband,
Elbert G*ipson, says he was born in
North Carolina in the year 1788, and
has distinct recollection of events that
took place in the war of 1812. Reliable
authority corroborates his statements.
Old citizens claim that he has been in
Shelby and Jefferson counties for at
least 100 years. His life has been
principally that of a farmer. Mr. Gip
son's wife, who claims to be 89 years
old, and says she has been married to
him for 65 years, is quite active for
one so aged.
The greatest library building In the
world, with a housing capacity for 4,
500,000 volumes and cosung approxi­
mately $3,000,000, is now entering the
final stages of completion on Fifth
Avenue, New York, between Fortieth
and Forty-second streets, where the
great reservoir for the city water
formerly stood. This mammoth struc­
ture, which will be known as the
"New York Public Library—Astor,
Lenox and Tilden Foundations," is a
combination of the Astor ead Lenox
libraries, and they will be strength­
ened by the Tilden trust.
WASHINGTON LETTER
THE PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE A
MOST IMPORTANT ONE.
RAILWAY RATE PROMINENT
Diminishing Number Ex-Confeder­
ates in Congress—Passing of Dis­
tinct Southern Type—Home
Spirit in Middle West.
A S HI N 0 N.—
President Roose­
velt has his an­
nual message com­
pleted, a finely en­
grossed copy ready
for filing away and
carefully typewrit­
ten copies, tied
with ribbon, to be
presented to the
house and senate
and read before
those bodies and
about 10,000 copies printed and ready
for distribution as soon as the impor­
tant document has been read in con­
gress. This is probably the most im­
portant message the president has ever
sent to congress and is the longest. It
contains from 20,000 to 25,000 words,
which is an unusually lengthy com­
munication for an executive to send to
congress.
As the country knows pretty gener­
ally, Mr. Roosevelt makes railway leg­
islation the chief feature of his mes­
sage. When congress adjourned last
winter without doing anything on this
subject the president announced that
he would take every opportunity to
keep it alive and he has done so. In
his own speeches he has told very
clearly what he will ask congress to
do and Secretary of War Taft and Sen­
ator Knox, of Pennsylvania, former at
torney general, have aided in promul­
gating the administration policy. The
president proposes that congress au­
thorize the interstate commerce com­
mission or some other governmental
body to declare when a railroad rate
is unreasonable and then to fix a rate
which is reasonable. The railroads are
to be given recourse to the federal
courts if they are not satisfied.
The president will treat of a great
number of subjects in his message in
addition to railroad matters, prominent
among them being federal control of
insurance companies, the Santo Domin
gan treaty, the Panama canal, preserv­
ing the Niagara falls, our relations
with foreign governments, but it is
said he will not have any observations
to make on the tariff.
Retirement of Senator Blackburn.
NE of the results of
the recent elec­
tions, it is said,
will be the retire­
ment of Senator
Jo Blackburnr of
ky. His
term expires in
1907, but the con­
test this fall has
(, shown that the
control of the leg­
islature is in dan­
ger of passing
away from his friends. Senator Black­
burn is one of the old-time southern
orators and a man of unique character
and manners. He will be greatly
missed if the wheel of politics should
throw him out of public life.
Blackburn served for ten years in
the house and most of his reputation
he made for oratory was achieved in
that body. He was then in the prime
of life and vigor and his fine reso­
nant voice was frequently heard in de­
bate. He was never known for the
profundity of his arguments, but he
had a way of speakingv that was im­
pressive. He is one of those orators
who can take a self-eviden^ proposition
and restate it in complex sentences so
as to make it appear as an entirely
new discovery and Something of won­
derful meaning and depth. He could
argue on the floor of the senate for
five minutes that two and two make
four and to the ordinary listener it
would sound as though he were dem­
onstrating a most abtruse problem.
The Kentucky senator is one of the
diminishing number of ex-confederates
now in congress. He served all through
the war in the confederate army and
has an excellent record for bravery.
He served two terms in the senate, be­
ginning in '85 and then was retired for
four years when the republicans con
trolled the legislature, but in 1900 suc­
ceeded former Senator William Lind­
say, who had turned gold democrat in
'96 and refused to support Bryan in
1900. New leaders have sprung up in
Kentucky, however, and Mr. Black­
burn is said to be slated for retire­
ment. He will have reached within
one year of the scriptural limit of life
of three score and ten when his term
expires.
The Old Southerners.
HE retirement
Senator Blackburn
reduces still fur­
ther the group of
senators from the
south who have in
these modern days
retained many of
the characteristics
and mannerisms
ante-bellum days
removed an
of
The death of Sena­
tor, Bate, of Ten
nessee, last spring
old-time and old-style
southerner from public life. There are
not a great many of this type left.
Money, of Mississippi Morgan and
Pettus, of Alabama Berry, of Arkan­
sas McCreary. of Kentucky and'Mc
Enery, of Louisiana, are about all who
could now be classed as typical south­
erners in dress and manners, with the
exception 1Bailey, of Texa&, a com­
paratively young man, who affects
even more than his seniors the old
style southern dress. This uniform is
the long-skirted black coat, low-cut
vest and black slouch hat.
The other senators from the south
cannot be distinguished from their
northern colleagues and look, for
the most part, like prosperous busi­
ness men and usually attend the ses­
sions of the senate dressed in business
clothes. On state occasions the whole
senate dresses in the black Prince Al­
bert coat, although the cut of the gar­
ments worn by the old southerners is
not so stylish as that of the other
members. This uniformity of black,
closely-buttoned frock coat adds very
much to the appearance of the senate
and the body seems to lose some of its
dignity when in every day routine of
work senators appear in sack coa'ts,
cutaways and other styles of garments
of various colors.
Another decade will probably see the
last of the ante-bellum type of south­
erner in Washington. The numerous
railroads that bind the south to the
north and the interchange of commerce
has done wonders in amalgamating the
sections and destroying the distinctive
types of citizens. This is nowhere so
apparent as in the congress of the
United States, where men from the
most remot^ sections of the south and
west meet.
Our "Home" Country.
HE great Mississip­
pi valley and the
middle west is be­
coming the section
A a
homes," said Mr.
Babcock, of Wis­
consin, the other
day in comment­
ing on the changes
that are being
worked by the in­
creasing popula­
tion of the coun­
try. It had been suggested that the
American people were not a home peo­
ple. The ancestral homes of England,
about which poets have sung, do not
abound in this country, and even in
the old settlements of the east com­
paratively few homesteads are found
where more than one generation has
lived. On this point Mr. Babcock de­
clared that the middle west, the gre^t
.states of Illinois, Wisconsin, Iowa anjd
others, were now the great home coun­
try of America.
"Out in this delightful section," said
Mr. Babcock, "you find the home spirit
more deeply established than in the
rich and prosperous east. In many of
these states you find a strong German
element, and wherever that is you find
the love of home and the ambition to
found a home that will remain in the
same family for generations. Oi
course the country is too new to show
any very long established homesteads,
but I can point to you in my dwn
state and in adjoining states scores and
hundreds of places where the head oi
the household established himself 30,
40 and 50 years ago and where the
original estate has been preserved, a
substantial house built and occupied
first by the original owner and then by
his oldest son, while surrounding the
homestead are the homes of other
children of the family. There are
many of these patriarchial establish­
ments and in them I think you will
find the hope for the stability and con­
servatism nQcessary to a safe govern­
ment."
It is not known whether Mr. Bab­
cock has followed the example of the
good people whom he describes, but he
has purchased enough homes in Wash­
ington to insure places for all his heirs
if they wish to locate here.
'Wise Man of the East."
ASHINGTON has
within its borders
this winter a very
distinguished East
Indian in the per­
son of Mr. Raman
athan, his Brittanic
majesty's solicitor
general of the is­
land of Ceylon. In
the religious life
of India Mr. Ra
manathan is class­
ified as a Jnana
Yogi, which means literally, "a wise
man of the east." This title will in­
sure him great consideration at the
national capital.
This distinguished personage, lawyer,
statesman and philosopher was in­
vited to this country by a number of
American scholars and students who
are interested in the religion and phil­
osophy of the orient He expects to
deliver a few pubHc and a number of
private lectures while here. He comes
from a long line of high-caste Hindus
and his family for many generations
have been the leaders of Ceylon in
wealth, education and social require­
ments. He is reputed to be the best
equipped Hindu lawyer in southern In­
dia.
The position of Mr. Ramanathan and
his family in the religious life of Cey­
lon has been even more important than
in the secular. His father erected the
chief temple or cathedral of "Colombo
in which six daily services are per­
formed, besides the monthly festivities.
He has made a life study of various
religions, »with a view of reaching a
harmony of the eastern and western
religious ideals. He has made a criti­
cal and expensive study of the Chris­
tian Scriptures in addition to the sa­
cred books of the Hindu religion. While
in Washington this winter he will en­
deavor to find time to translate into
English the original Sanscrit and
Tamil, the celebrated Indian epics,
known as "The Maha-Bharats" and the
"Ramayana," which are considered the
gems of the spiritual literature of the
Ayran race.
•J—J
A.
MOST ZEALOUS ZIONIST
There are lovers of good literature that de­
sire Israel Zangwill should devote himself to his
profession of letters and leave the Jew problem
to others. But the man that wrote "The Chil­
dren of The Ghetto," "Dreamers of The Ghetto"
and "Ghetto Tragedies" cannot remain indifferent
to the oppressed of his race. In the recent con­
ference at London of prominent Jews from Eng­
land, Paris, Berlin and St. Petersburg, Lord
Rothschild presided and Israel Zangwill made
an impassioned plea for the wretched Jew in­
troduced a resolution expressing indignation and
horror at the Russian outrages, and declaring
that the establishment of a haven'of refuge, an
autonomous Jewish colony, for the gradual recep­
tion of the oppressed, was the only solution of
the question. Max Nordau and Zangwill are two
names that have been very prominent among
the leaders of thought identified with this move­
ment.
Zangwill was born in London, the son of Hebrew parents, and attended
the Jewish Free School, Spitalfields, in the east end of London. He is
largely self-educated. He has been a school-teacher, journalist, lecturer,
has written poems, novels, plays and essays. His pictures of Jewish life and
character have brought him wide fame they are intensely dramatic, they
opened up unknown regions.
A MANY-SIDED NORWEGIAN
Fridtjof Nansen is explorer, teacher, patriot.
He has just been appointed minister from Nor­
way to Great Britain.
Nansen is now 44 years old, a comparatively
young man to have accomplished, what he has.
He was born near Christiania, son of a well
known Norwegian advocate. At the University
of Christiania he received his education, was
trained for a zoologist. In 1882 he took a
trip to the waters of East Greenland in search
of zoological specimens, and the same year be­
came curator of the Natural History 'museum at
Bergen. In 1888 he made an adventurous trip
across Greenland, from east to west coast, the
first man to cross the ice cap. This experience
he has described in two volumes: "The First
Crossing of Greenland." A winter spent among
the natives of West Greenland brought forth
the volume "Eskimo Life," and his experience
with these people proved of greatest value when
on his famous polar expedition, an expedition of which he had dreamed and
over which labored from the year he was 23.
Nine years the dreams and labors went on until we find the traveler
equipped for his great exploration, ready to start on what was to prove the
farthest north ever attained. Assisted by the government and enterprise
of private citizens, the "Fram" was built and equipped, and the hardy and well
prepared adventurer set forth. Nansen held to a theory different from the
weight of authority that a ship driven by the prevailing winds might drift
from above Siberia across the pole. The Fram skiretd the north coasts of
Europe and Asia, entered polar pack ice near New Siberia islands, and
drifted northwest. On a March day Nansen, with a single companion,
left the ship and started with dog sledges towards the pole. Twenty-four
days later he reached 86 degrees, 4 minutes north latitude, 272 miles from
the goal. Here he was forced to give up, but he had penetrated to a point
184 miles beyond that made by any other man. Nansen and his companion
spent the winter amid "the silence of a thousand years," and when spring
came journeyed southward back to habitations of man.
AN ENGLISH HUMORIST
English folk are wont to disapprove of the
irreverent American humor Americans are wont
to poke fun, open and not quite so open, at the
lack of humor among the English. Be this as it
may, we have visiting the United States at pres­
ent an English humorist, "Jerum K. Jerum."
Until making personal acquaintance with
the gentleman, a fairly large American audi­
ence familiar with his books had been' accus­
tomed to pronounce his name as spelled, Eng­
lish as she is writ. One thing we have learned
from personal contact to call Jerome, Jerum.
Not that we are saying we have not learned
more. Far from us be such a fling, such dis­
courtesy.
Mr. Jerum is a genial looking gentleman, and
genially disposed, willing to say pleasant things
about the American girl, America's tall build­
ings, etc., etc. And perhaps it is well, for he is
to remain in the country a matter of six months
or so, is to lecture and travel rather extensively.
When was it people began to read his books—"The Idle Thoughts of an
Idle Fellow?" "Three Men in a Boat?" Let us see back'in the early nineties,
wasn't it? As we remember them, they were lightsome and amusing we
feel moved to extend a lazy welcome to the English humorist we are will­
ing to pay tho price to hear what he may have to say when appearing in
public on the stage.
A NOTED ANGLO-AMERICAN VISITOR
An interesting woman is John Oliver Hobbes.
Her real name, of course, is less masculine,
Pearl Mary Teresa Craigie.
Mrs. Craigie was born in Boston several
years ago—but less than 40—daughter of John
Morgan Richards. At the age of 19 she mar­
ried an Englishman, Reginald Walpole Craigie,
from whom she separated five years later and
subsequently was divorced.
Mrs. Craigie is one of the most distinguished
of the American women residing abroad, as an
eminent author and lecturer. She is also a
jyjwrl" ....jffl/yvJMwfa musician of considerable attainment, and an
expert chess player. And we may add that she
^1
is considered one of
I* 4gufflt/WK'''v' Jl lar matrons in London society, has a house in
London and two places on the Isle of Wight.
Perhaps it is needless to mention that she is a
clubwoman, for the papers are always giving us
her public presentation of views on this and that
timely subject she is a member of the Ladies' Athaeneum and the Lyceum
club.
Some readers doubtless think of Mrs. Craigie as the woman who writes
the books with the queer titles for instance: "The Gods, Some Mortals and
Lord Wickenham "Some Emotions and a Moral," "The Sinner's Comedy,"
"A Study in Temptations," "Journeys End in Lover's Meeting." John Oliver
Hobbes is also the author of "The Herb Moon" and the "School for Saints
of the three-act tragedy "Osbern and Useyne of the plays "The Ambas­
sadress" and "A Repentance." She contributes to the leading daily papers
of England and to magazines and reviews.
Mrs. Craigie expects to lecture in various American cities.
ANOTHER CHINESE INSTRUCTOR
the most brilliant and popu-
Wu-Ting-Fang, you remember, traveled about
our country pouring into our receptive and un­
sophisticated ears information of divers sorts—
and oft extolling China by. American compari­
son. We are nothing as a nation if not good
natured, and then we always have the childish
curiosity to know what the foreigners think of
us anyway. Recently the Chinese minister at
Washington, Sir Ghentung Liang-Cheng, has been
telling us.
And he has told us some wholesome truths,
too. The other night at the banquet of the
Merchants' club in Chicago, where the Chinese
minister was guest of honor, he delivered an im­
pressive address. The oriental urged that west­
ern civilization be marked by fair play. The
large audience listened to him attentively, at the
close of his address applauded so vigorously the
red and yellow drapings of the banquet room
waved as in response.
The wily Chinese dignitary won his listeners by reference to the fact
that he himself is American by education—he was [educated at Phillips acad
emy and at Andover college—and by the statement of his pride in the two
countries of America and China. He ^ron them also by his just attitude
towards certain well-known features of the relations of Chinese and Amer­
icans the mob violence against American missionaries with which his gov­
ernment has had to cope the mob violence against the Chinese in Amer­
ica, against which his government has been moved to protest. And he gave
food for thought in the ^declaration that while the death penalty had been
inflicted on the rioters China, he had no knowledge of the same punish­
ment having been meted out for the offense here. And the clever celestial
spoke of desirable extension of commerce between the two countries. And
be referred to early relations of "friendliest character."
CHRISTOPHER WEBSTER.
When Commissioner Garfield went
to the Chicago packers and asked pel?
mission to inspect their books, "the con-,
dltion was made that no information^
he might obtain therefrom would be
used' in court proceedings against
them. I
Mr. Garfield gave this pledge, it is
stated, and the packers allowed him
to study their business in all its de­
tails from the inside.
Now, it is announced, the results of
bis study have been turned over to the
government department of justice to
be employed in legal prosecution of
the packers.
Commissioner Garfield would not
have ventured to give the pledge that
was demanded by the packers without
instructions from Washington. He
pledged, not his own word, but the
government's. It is not his good faith,
but the government's, that is in aues
tion now.
The Journal has no concern for the
packers, except as they are citizens of
Chicago. If it can be proved that tbey
are guilty of engaging in a conspiracy
in restraint of trade, they ought to be
punished.
But their guilt, if they are guilty,
must be fairly proved. They must be
given a square deal.
Since the government has elevated
Its vision to such a height as to over­
look the nest of defiant criminal trusts
In New Jersey, almost within the
shadow of the capitol dome, in order
to fasten itself a thousand miles away
upon Chicago, the government and the
President cannot be too careful to
avoid suspicion that they are more
anxious to prosecute western offenders
than offenders in the east
Some of the methods already em­
ployed in this case have not been par­
ticularly distinguished for decency.
When the government breaks into a
.man's house and steals his private pa­
pers, when it drags the wives of pack­
ing-house employes into court and
puts them under heavy bondi, it is
hardly dignified, not to say honorable,
nor even respectable.—From the Chi­
cago Journal, Nov. 6, 1905.
MEDICAL MENTIOJT.
8wedish physicians say whistling will
do much toward the development of a
robust physical frame.
A silver solution, called cpllangol, has
been used successfully in Germany in
the treatment of appendicitis.
There were only four deaths per 1,000
among the children who passed through
the late Dr. Barnardo's hands.
The sanitary influence of the eucalyp­
tus tree is said to render native-born
Australians immune to cancer.
Prof. Karl Schleich says that "com­
bating fatigue with nicotine, alcohol,
tea or coffee, is like bandaging the eyes
of a watch dog."
Ammonia vapor has been discovered
to be the best disinfectant for use in
cases of cholera or diphtheria. It will
free a room from germs in two hours.
The international Italian "KingEfum
bert prize" of 2v500 francs for the most
important contribution to orthopedic
surgery has been awarded to Dr. Oscar
Culpins of Heidelberg.
One of the speakers at the tuber­
culosis' congress In Paris maintained
that parents suffering from consump­
tion should not be allowed to keep their
children. Another suggested that all
domestic animals should be made im­
mune with tuberculine.
INDUSTRIAL ITEMS.
The European sugar crop this year
Is estimated at between 6,550,000 and
6,675,000 tons. The German crop will
probably amount to 2.200,000 tons.
England's first spinning mill to b«r
worked by electricity has been started
at Pendlebury, Manchester. It con­
tains 80,000 spindles, and has no chim­
ney.
The first solid train of canned peas
ever shipped from an American can­
ning factory went out from a canning
company's plant at Longmont, Col.,
recently.
Last year 48,000,000 tons of cargo
were carried from all the seaports of
the world, and out of that total 31,
000,000 tons were carried by ships
of Great Britain.
Growing of grapes in graperies fur­
nishes an important source of rev­
enue in some countries, notably Bel­
gium and the Channel islands, where
large quantities are annually grown
and exported. The United States is
a good customer for them, as high as
35 cents to 75 cents a pound wholesale,
and two to three dollars, and even
more, a pound retail being paid for
the fruit. Grape g/owing in pots is
much practiced in parts of Europe, and
especially in France, where the vines
are largely used for decorative pur­
poses on festive occasions.
TWICE-TOLD TESTIMONY.
A Woman Who Has Suffered Tell# Hon
to Find Relief.
The thousands of women who suffer
backache,, languor, urinary disorders
and other kidney ills,
will find comfort in
the words of Mrs.
Jane Farrell, of 606
Ocean Ave., Jersey
City, N. J., who says:
"I reiterate all I
have said before in
"praise of Doan's Kid­
ney Pills. I had been
-jf having heavy back­
aches, and my gen­
eral health was affected when I began
using them. My feet were swollen, my
eyes puffed, and dizzy spells were fre­
quent. Kidney action was irregular
and the secretions highly colored.
Today, however, I am a well woman,
and I am confident that Doan's Kidney
Pills have made me so, and are keeping
me well."
