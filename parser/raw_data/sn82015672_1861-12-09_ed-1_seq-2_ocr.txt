Secretary Cameron's Report.
Considerable fault has been fonnd with
the President's message, because it did not
more fully discuss those questions iu which
the people are most interested. Our for
eign relations, including the complications
likely to grow out of the seizure of Mason
and Slidell, the President dispsea of in
one brief, unsatisfactory paragraph ; while
the great rebellion, whose suppression is
taxing the nation's powers to the utmost.
is passed by with some very obscure we
might Bay "obfusticated" remarks. What
ever fault may be found with the President's
message in this particular, the same cannot
be charged against the Report of the Secretary
of War. Mr. Cameron plunges in mediae
rat, with a directness and positireaesa that
leaves no one in doubt as to bis earnestness.
or meaning.
He first gives us a tabular statement of
the strength of onr army. There were rais.
ed for the three month's service 77,876 men
There have been enlisted, for the term of
three year's, 640,637 men. This estimate
we presume, counts all the regiments which
have been authorized by the Governors of
the various States as full, which is not
strictly correct, though there is but little
doubt they will be ready to take the field
in a few weeks at farthest. The estimated
strength of the regular army is 20,334. The
grand total, regulars and volunteers, foots
up 660,971 men, rallied in six months to de
fend the honor aad integrity of the Union
This gigantic army is divided as follows
Infantry, 568,383; cavalry, 69,398 ; artil
lery, 27,688 ; rifles and sharpshooters, 8,395
engineers. 107. The secretary has no
doubt, from the manner in which the coun
try responded to the appeal of the Prest
dent for 600,000 volunteers, that the force
now in the field could easily have been
swelled to 1,000,000. It was considered
one of Bonaparte's greatest triumphs, that
he increased his army from 200,000 to
414,000 between the months of April and
September. Mr. Cameron contrasts this ef
fort of the Emperor Napoleon, with that of
our Government. He says :
At the commencement of this rebellion
inaugurated by the attack upon Fort Sum
ter, the entire military force at the disposal
of this Government was 16,000 regulars,
principally employed in the West to hold
in check marauding Indians. In April,
75,000 volunteers were called upon to en
list for three months' service, and respond
ed with such alacrity that 77,875 were im
mediately obtained. Under the authority
of the act of Congress of July 29, 1861, the
States were asked to furnish 500,000 vol
unteers to serve for three years, or during
the war ; and by the act approved the 29th
of the same month, the addition of 25,000
men to the regular army of the United
States was authorised. The result is, that
We have now an army of upwards of 600,000
men. If we add to this the number of the
discharged three months' volunteers, the
aggregate force furnished to the Govern
ment since April last exceeds 700,000 men.
We have here an evidence of the won
derful strength of our institutions. With
out conscriptions, levies, drafts, or other
extraordinary expedients, we have raised a
greater force than that which, gathered by
Napoleon with the aid of all these appli
ances, was considered an evidence of his
wonderful genins and energy, and of the
military spirit of the French nation. Here
every man has an interest in the govern
ment, and rushes to its defence when dan
gers beset it.
By comparing our present ability as a'
nation with what Massachusetts did during
the Revolutionary war when, out of a
population of 350,000, she had at one time
56.000 troops in the field Mr. Cameron
concludes, that should an emergency simi
lar to that arise, our Government could
promptly put into the field an army of
over 3,000,000 a force the vastneas of
which is unappreciable.
The Secretary compliments the troops for
the creditable degree of discipline to which
they have attained, and is confident they
cannot fail to achieve success.
He then speaks of the vastuess of the
conspirm-y, extending over an area of couu
try of 733,144 square miles, with a shore
line of 35,414 miles, a coast line of 3,523
miles, and an interior boundary line of
7,031 miles in length. Added to the vast
expanse of country included in the insur
rection, is the formidable character of the
preparations made by the rebels having
stripped us of arms and munitions and scat
tered our navy to the most distant quarters
of the globe, before they struck their first
blow.
The progress of onr arms is then taken
up. The successes of the rebels are frankly
acknowledged. The Bull Run defeat is at
tributed to a premature advance which the
impatience of the country demanded, but
" the possession of Western Virginia and the
occupation of Hatteras and Beaufort, are j
considered as having nobly redeemed our
transient reverses."
The recommendations of the Secretary
are, condensed, as follows :
That the Springfield armory be enlarged
until it can supply the demand of the conn
try for small arras.
The establishment of a national foundry
for the manufacture of heavy artille ry at
Bach point as may afford the greatest facili
ties for the purpose.
There-organisation, upon a uniform Labis,
of the militia of the country.
The increasing and strengthening of onr
fortifications upon the seaboard and the
lakes, and upou oar exposed frontiers.
The increase of the corps of cadets in the
military academy, and that the increase be
taken from the loyal states. Authority to
retire Col. Sylvanus Thayer, upon his full
pay and enrollments, for his valuable ser
vice in the Military Institute.
That the systems of promotion in the
regnlar service be applied to the volunteer
forces in the respective States ; also a change
in the system by which regular army of
ficers rank volunteer officers of same grade,
so that seniority of commission alone shall
confer the right of command ; also abolish
ing the distinctions between regulars and
volunteers.
A repeal of the law which prevents the
regular soldier from drawing bis full pay
monthly; and the payment of a reasonable
bounty when enlisting, or an advance of $20
on the $100 dne him on the expiration of
his term of enlistment.
Limiting the number of aids of Major
Generals to those who can be advantage-
eusly employed upon their own proper staff.
Urging the repeal of the act compelling
the War Department to discharge minors
on proof that their enlistment was without
consent of their parents or guardians.
Limiting the employment of regimental
bands, the proportion now being being en'
tirely too great.
The construction of a double track rail
road between Washington and Annapolis
Junction, with improved sidings and facili
ties. Also the construction of additional
railroad facilities between Washington and
Baltimore. Also the construction of a rail
way through Washington from the Navy
Yard to Georgetown, forming a junction
with the Orange & Alexandria Railroad.
The Secretary also suggests that a change
be made in the boundary lines of Maryland,
Virginia and Delaware, by agreement be
tween the States named, such as was effect
ed for similar purpose by Michigan and
Ohio, and Vtfswntfl and Iowa. The change
suggested, is -
That the limits of Virginia be so altered
as to make her boundaries consist of the
Blue Ridge on the East and Pennsylvania
on the North, leaving those on the South
and West as at present. By this arrange
ment two counties of Maryland (Alleghany
and Washington) would be transferred to
the jurisdiction of Virginia. All that por
tion of Virginia which lies between the
Blue Ridge and Chesapeake Bay could
then be added to Maryland, while that por
tion of the peninsula between the waters of
the Chesapeake and the Atlantic, now
jointly held by Maryland and Virginia,
could be incorporated into the State of
Delaware.
To make the protection of the Capital
complete, in consideration of the large ac
cession of territory which Maryland would
receive under the arrangement proposed, it
would be necessary that that State should
consent to modify her constitution so as to
limit the basis of her representation to her
white population.
In this connection, it would be the part
of wisdom to re-annex to the District of
Columbia that portion of its original limits
which by act of Congress was retroceded to
the State of Virginia.
But the portion of Mr. Cameron's Report
which will arouse the warmest discussions
and excite the people the most intensely, is
that devoted to the discussion of the Con
traband question. Additional interest is
thrown around it because it is now known
to have been urged directly in the teeth of
Mr. Lincoln's moet positive objections. We
copy it in full :
It has become a grave question for de
termination, what shall be done with the
slaves abandoned by their owners oife the
advance of our troops into Southernerri
tory, as in the Beaufort district of South
Carolina. The whole white popnlation
therein is six thousand, while the number
of negroes is thirty-two thousand. The
panic which drove their masters in wild
confusion from their homes, leaves them in
undisputed possession of the soil. Shall
they, armed by their masters, be placed in
the field to fight against us, or shall their
labor be continually employed in reprodu
cing the me-ns for supporting the armies of
the rebellion?
The war into which this government has
been forced by rebellious traitors, is carried
on for the purpose of reposaesing the prop
erty violently and treacherously seized up
on by the enemies of the government, and
to re-establish the authority and laws of
the United States in the places where it is
opposed or overthrown by armed insurrec
tion and rebellion.
War, even between independent nations,
is made to subdue the enemy, and all that be
longs to that enemy, by occupying the hos
tile country, and exercising dominion ever
all the men and things within its territory.
This being true in respect to independent
nations at war, with each other, it follows
that rebels who are laboring by force of
arms to overthrow a government, justly
bring upon themselves all the consequences
of war, and provoke the destruction mer
ited by the worst of crimes. That govern
ment would be lalse to national trust, and
would justly excite the ridicule ol the civ
ilized world, that would abstain from the
use of any efficient means to preserve its
own existence, or to overcome a rebellious
and traitorous enemy, by sparing or pro
tecting the property of those who are wa
ging war against it.
The principal wealth and power of the
rebel States is a peculiar species of proper
ty, consisting of the service or laaor of
African slaves, or the descendants of Afri
cans. This property has been variously
estimated at the value of from $700,000,
000 to $1,000,000,000.
Why should this property be exempt from
the hazards and consequences of a rebel
I lious war?
j It was the boast of the leader of the re
, bellioo, while be yet bad a seat in the Sen
' ate of the United States, that the Southern
QtetuS wnlllr) ha nAimruirjtiraliT aafn anil
frM from the barden3 of war, if it should
be brought on by the contemplated rebel
lion, and that boast was accompanied by
the savage threat that "Northern towns
and cities would become the victims of ra
pine and military spoil," and that "North
ern men should smell Southern gunpow
der and feel Southern steel." No one
doubts the disposition of the rebels to car
ry that threat into execution. The wealth
of Northern towns and cities, the prodnce
of Northern farms, Northern workshops and
manufactories, would certainly be seized,
destroyed, or appropriated as military spoil.
No property in the North would be spared
from the hands of the rebels, and their ra
pine would be defended under the laws of
war. While the loyal States thus have all
their property and possessions at stake, are
the insurgent rebels to carry on warfare
against the government in peace and secu
rity to their own property?
Reason and justice and self-preservation
forbid that such should be the policy of
this government, but demand, on the con
trary, that being forced by traitors and
rebels to the extremity of war, all the
rights and powers of war should be exer
cised to bring it to a speedy end.
Those who make war against the gov
ernment, justly forfeit all rights of proper
ty, privilege, or security, derived from the
Constitution and laws, against which they
are in armed rebellion; and as the labor and
service of their slaves constitute the chief
property of the rehels, such property should
share the common fate of war to which
they have devoetd the property of loyal
citizens.
While it is plain that the slave property
of the South is justly subjected to all the
consequences of this rebellious war, and
that the Government would be untrue to its
trust in not employing all the rights and
powers of war to bring it to a speedy close,
the details ot the plan for doing so, like all
other military measures, must, in a great
degree, be left to be determined by particu
lar exigencies. The disposition of other
property belonging to the rebels that be
comes subject to our arms, is governed by
the circumstances of the case. The govern
ment has no power to hold slaves, none to
restrain a slave of his liberty, or to exact
his service. It has a right, however, to use
the voluntary service of slaves liberated by
war from their rebel masters, like any other
property of the rebels, in whatever mode
may be most efficient for the defense of the
Government, the prosecution of the war,
and the suppression of the rebellion. It is
as clearly a right of the Government to
arm slaves, when it may become necessary,
as it is to use gunpowder taken from the
enemy. Whether it is expedient to do so
is purely a military question. The right is
unquestionable by the laws of war. The
expediency must be determined by circum
stances, keeping in view the great object of
overcoming the rebels, re-establishing the
laws, ami restoring peace to the nation.
It is vain and idle for the government to
carry on this war, or hope to maintain its
existence against rebellious force, without
employing all the rights and powers of war.
As has been said, the right to deprive the
rebels of their property in (laves and slave
labor, is as clear and absolute as the right
to lake forage from the Held, or cotton from
the warehouse, or powder and arms from
the magazine. To leave the enemy in the
possession of such property as forage and
cotton and military stores, and the means of
constantly reproducing them, would be
madness. It is, therefore, equal to mad
ness to leave them in peaceful and secure
possession of slave property, more valuable
and efficient to them for war, than forage,
cotton and military stores. Such policy
would te national suicide. What to do
with that species of property, is a question
that time and circumstances will solve, and
need not be anticipated further than to re
peat that they cannot be held by the gov
ernment as slaves. It would be useless to
keep them as prisoners of war; and self
preservation, the highest duty of a govern
ment, or of individuals, demands that they
should be disposed of or employed in the
most effective manner that will tend most
speedily to suppress the insurrection and
restore the authority of the government.
If it shall be found that the men who have
been held by the rebels as slaves, are capa
ble of bearing arms and performing effi
cient military service, it is the right, and
may become the duty of the government to
arm and equip them, and employ their ser
vices against the rebels, under proper mili
tary regulation, discipline and command.
But in whatever manner chey may be
used by the government, it is plain that,
once liberated by the rebellious act of their
masters, they should never again be restor
ed to bondage. By the master's treason
and rebellion he forfeits all right to the la
bor and service of his slave, and the slave
of the rebellious .master, by his service to
the government, becomes justly entitled to
freedom and protection.
The disposition to be made of the slaves
of rebels, after the close of the war, can
safely be left to the wisdom and patriotism
ol Congress. The representatives of the
people will unquestionably secure to the
loyal slaveholders every right to which
they are entitled under the Constitution of
the country.
Military Itsms. We find the following
iu the Indianapolis Sentinel of Saturday :
General Buell,in Kentucky, has issued an
order forbidding all women, whether the
wives of officers or privates, from following
camps, or appearing in the vicinity of a
field of battle.
The Indiana troops in Missouri are at Se

The case of Mason and Slidell is not
the only one upon which the diplomatists
of the United States and England will have
to display their acumen. The offense if
it be so considered of stopping an English

It would appear to be high time
that Mr. George D. Prentice if he is any
longer editor of "that great paper," the
Louisville Journal should be at bis post.
While be has been East his associate editor

ous as possible. The article of the Journal
on the President's Message is so unwar
rantable as to seem perfectly wanton, and
has given the traitors in Kentucky substan
tial "aid and comfort." Before the Journal
receives any further aid and comfort from
Union men, it would be well to have tbis
matter understood. Cin. Commercial.

The iut Intelligencer of the
28th says :
The soldiers up in Cheat Mountain have
built a very respectable mountain city in
which to house tbis winter. When the
disadvantages under which the men had to
labor are taken into consideration, it will
appear that a gigantic work has been per
formed. One brigade had no tools except
a few axes, one "secesh" auger, one ditto
adze, one ditto drawknife, and with this
meager supply four thousand men had to
work. The greater part of the lumber had
to be brought from a distance of half a
mile, and that upon the backs of the men.
It is a novel as well as a pitiable sight to
see from twenty to twenty-five men stag
gering along beneath a huge pine, and
fairly dropping when they arrive, from
pure exhaustion. The chimneys are all
substantial stone structures, while the
buildings are neatly roofed, and "chinked
and daubed" thoroughly.
WSf It is stated by the Indianapolis cor
respondence of the Cincinnati Gazette that
authorities claim here that Indiana will
have over 65,000 men in the field this
month, making over 89,700 more than her
quota, for three years or during tbe war.
The War Department will accept no more
cavalry. All companies now organizing
will be transferred to the infantry.

It says there is no plantation in the State
