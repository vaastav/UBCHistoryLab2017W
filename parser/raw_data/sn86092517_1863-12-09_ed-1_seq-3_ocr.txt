Mr. Franzheira was in favor of closing
the bridge entirely, or erecting a permanent

pagseDgers and wagons. Crowds of persons
were daily on the bridge, especially on Sun

ed in by tho First Branch.
Demand Note*. ? In handling "green
backs," it would be well to look out for de
mand notes, as those who were in the habit
of "salting them down,'' have found it ne
cessary to give thein circulation. The de*
mand notes are worth the same rate of
premium as gold.

Lire's Sscoftb Morning. ? We hare met
with few more beautiful lines than the fol
lowing, from the pen of Mrs. Barbauld}
which the poet Rogers, in his latter years,
was fond of repeating to his friends with
jost enough of tremolonsness in his fine
voice to give his recitation the effect of deep
feeling. They were written by Mrs. Bar
bauld in her old age :
life ! we've been long together
Through pleasant and through cloudy weather !
'Tis hard to part when friends are dear?
Perhaps 'twill cost a sigh or tsar ;
Then steal away, giving little warning,
Choose thins own time ;
Say not good night; hut im some happisr clime
Bid me good morning.
The Legislature hss resolved to adjourn
sine die on Friday next.
It is astonishing the amount of buisness
that A. M. Adams & Co., do. One of the
firm is Bast every four or five weeks and if
there is any new styles of cloths, cassimers
or vestings they are the first to have it,
and of the best quality. Persons in want
of the best article of clothiig and at fair
pricea had better call and examine their
endless variety of cassimeres and vestings.
Their facilities for cutting and making
fashionable garments are unequaled in the
city for taste and style. nov 14 6m

Tuesday, Dec. 8, 1863.
Senator Wilson, of Mass., submitted a
resolution that the committee en Military
Affairs inquire what legislation is necessary
to fscilit&te the payment of back pay and
pensions of deceased soldiers, &c.
Mr. Davis, of Ky., submitted a resolution
that the refusal of the rebel authorities to
exchange negro soldiers and their white of
ficers should not prevent the exchange of
our other soldiers and officers in rebel pris
ons on just terms such as will prevent suf
fering to our brave soldiers and officers in
the hands of the enemy. Laid over.
Mr. Sherman called up his bis resolution
that the Judiciary committee enquire and
report whether Robt. Wilson was stilt Sen
ator from Missouri.
Mr. M'Pherson objected entirely to re
cognizing Mr. Wilson in any way as Sena
tor from Missouri.
Mr. M'Dougal said the law of the ques
tion had been settled, and as the friend of
the gentleman from Missouri he wss sorry.
He thought he had a claim.
Mr. Powell thought that the whole ques
tion depended on the fact whether the Le
gislature of Missouri had really adjourned
sine die or only taken a recess before com
ing together lately and electing a Senator.
The appointment of the Governor held good
until the proper assembly of the Legisla
ture and election by that body. It. had been
said, however, that the Legislature only
took a recess he would therefore like to
have the Judiciary committee inquire into
the facts.
Mr. Trumbull moved to amend the reso
lution by declaring that Mr. Wilson was
not entitled to a seat in the Senate. The
amendment was agreed to, and the resolu
tion adopted.
The Clerk of the House here appeared,
and announced that the House had organ
ized and appointed a committee to wait on
the President and Senate committee, to in
form him that both Houses were ready for
business.
The Senate took a recess for half an hour
and at the end of that time, Mr. Foote, of
the Senate committee, reported that it had
waited on the President, and that the latter
would communicate his Message to the
Senate at half past twelve to morrow.
Mr. Wilson, of Man., gave notice of a
bill to increase the bounty for volunteering
and to make an appropriation for the same
Adjourned.

tion, respectfully requesting the President

the resolution was laid over.

hibit slavery forever in the territories in

Secretary Chase's *e port will be trans
mitted by special messengers to the North
ern press to-morrow. He adopts all the re
commendations of the Commissioner of In
ternal Revenue in regard to whisky and to
baceo aad sugar, the propriety of a still fur
ther increase in the tax on these articles, in
order that the revenue amy be increased, as
it has fallen considerably below the esti
mates of the Cramers of the law. The re
ceipts from this source for last year will foil
short of $60,000,000.
Maj. Gen. French has been relieved from
his command in the Army of the Potomac,

From Southern Papers.
New York, Dec. 8. ? We have rebel ac
counts from Richmond papers of the 5th:
Dalton, Dec. 4.? -Gen Ledbetter arrived

same day made an unsuccessful attack on
Burnside, and then commenced retreating
to Virginia.
Hooker's and Siegel's corps are reportedi

Firing was heard yesterday in the direc
tion of Cleveland, supposed to be from

The steamer Colona had her upper works
burned on the 2d Inst., between Evansville
and Newberg.
Niw York, Deo. 8. ? The Tribune's
spec:al from Washington of the 7th says:
Although the President's Message is
ready it is probable that it will not be sent
to Congress before Wednesday, as there is
considerable doubt whether the House will
be ready to receive it before 2 or 3 o'clock
to morrow, by which time the House will
likely have adjourned. The most impor
tant and interesting portions of the mes
sage are those which deal with the subject
of slavery and referring to the Union of
the States that have been in rebellion. In
what the President says regarding the for
mer topic he considers as an accomplished
fact that the former Proclamation! has lib
erated the slaves within tho territory which
it embraces and all future action must be
hii^ed upon that supposition. In a word
the President does not and will not adopt
a policy which fails to givo the slave a ves
tige right in himself. The plan Mr. Lin
ooln proposes for the restoration of the
loyal people of truant States to their former
position in the Union is represented to be
purely is own and his unlike any now before
the public. Not confining himself to the
general outlines he enters with some minute
ucsi into the details in another part of the
message. The President alludes to the
victories gained during the year over tho
rebels and deals at some length upon the
progress and the present aspect and
prospect of the war.
Ihe bill creating an office, of which no
tice was given to-day by Mr. Washburne,
of III., is intended to give General Grant a
position vhich his talents and his vic
tories art generally thought to entitle him ;
K.voxvill*, Dec. 5 ? A special tothcTri
bune says: Ihe siege of Knoxville is raised
and Longstreet with his army is in full re
treat towards Virgiuia. It virtually ter
minated yesterday, when at an early hour i
the advance guard of our reinforcements
under Urn. Sherman arrived.
The enemy during the past few days kept
up an active show of intention to prolong
the fitege or renew the assault, but early !
tlh's morning when reconnoissance was sent
out by Gen. Fiero, they found their works
empty. A few deserters were brought in
who report the main body moved of!' after
leaving the rear guard and
pickets in their rifle pits to fall back at 2
A. M and join the remainder who thevtold 1
would form in line ot battle a short dis
tance east of the city. This ruse was to
prevent their prernaturo abandonment of
their picket line.
Gen. Shackleford with cavalry is already
in pursuit and close upon their rear Prison
ers, and deserters. are continually arriving
in squads of 10 to 20.
The deliverance and occupation 0f East

New* from the South.
New York, Dec. - 8. ? The Richmond
Whig of the 3d talk*- in the following plain
fashion: "With no other motive or thought
than to advance the public interest we
would again suggest to the President the
advantage of reconstruction in his cabinet
sod calling to his aid the very ablest intel
lects of the co an try. We have a depart
ment State that has not been able for nearly
three years to establish relations with any
other of State; a treasury departmentthst has
failed to keep its finances from running to
ruin; a war department in the hands of a
chief whose studies and course of life has
been purely and peculiarly civic; a navy de
partment without navy,* a post office de
partment with a very shackling system of
mails and a department of justice vacant.
The business of its department especially
shows the want of a more mastsrlv hand
and the united powers and their chiefs in
the cabinet council, if councils are ever
held, fail to supply the quantum of wisdom
the council needs. We are getting to deep
waters and a feeling of dread is staking the
souls of tb e people. Thcrs is nothiog ths
President can do that wil! so reanimate tbeir
hearts and stimulate their confidence iu an
affection for him, as the cslling to his side
as his daily advisers, a cabinet of the wisest,
truest and most experienced men in the
country regardless of what may hare been
thdir political associations. The time is
propitious, the occasion urgent and the peo
ple anxiously expectant for his own con
tinuoncy and capacity for usefulness and
future fame, as well as on account of ths
sorely necessitous and exigent condition of
the coun.try, that we earnestly press this
recommendation."
New York, Dec. 8. ? Ths People's Line
of steamers has suspended operations on
account of ice in the river. It is nesrly
eertain the trips will not be resumed this
season. There is much ice below Albany.
A special to the Post from Washington
says: See'y Chase's report will probably be
sent to the press to-morrow night. It is
considered certain thai the report will con
tain no recommendation for a further issue
of legal tender.
Mr. Lincoln is very much better.
Yesterday evening while Com. Vasder
bilt was driving along the Bloomingdale
road in a light wagon, the vehisle came in
contact with suother, by which bis carriage
was broken and the Commodore was thrown
over the dash-board to the ground, where
for some time he lav unconscious, but was
finally removed to a hotel near by where
he received medical attention. His injuries
are said not to be of a serious nature.
Boston, Dec. 8 ? At an early hoar this
moraine a fire broke out in the Bloomfield
street Methodist Church, which rapidly
gained headway and nearly destroyed the

studio bnildinga and other valuable proserty
which was seriously threatened with des
truction, was saved.
Washington, Dec. 7.? Judge Advereal
