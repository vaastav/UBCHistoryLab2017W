The elections will last, for at. least two

WOMAN MISER'S HOARD FOUND.
.Mrs. Jluiiiiicutt l.elt .S I I .OOO lu tier
Hut oti Cherokee strip.
Independence, Kan., D-e. 18,—The*
!sum of $11,000 in bills was found in the
'house of Mrs. Lucy Hunnicutt. on the
Cherokee strip, a few days ago. The
house had been closed since the wo
man's death, in September last. She
had lived alone on her claim for a long
time, practically a dependent upon the
charity of her neighbors, who believed
her penniless.
When she died her remains wore sent
to C.reencastle, lnd., for interment, at
t'be request of her relatives there, and
the house 011 the strip was closed up.
A few days ago it was reopened, and in
removing t'be household goods the
money was found under the carpets,
sewed up in the linings -of old dress
skirts, tucked away in feather beds and
in various other places.
Mrs. Hunnicutt was a Miss Lucy
Crow, daughter of a farmer in Put
nam county, Indiana. At 20 years of age
she married Hunnicutt against her
father's wishes. The marriage proved
to be an unhappy one, and in 18K7 she
came to KansaH, followed by her lius
band. When the Cherokee strip was
opened ito settlement sh^ urged her hus
band to ••make the run" for a claim,
lie consented, but afterwards backed
out. and Mrs. llunnicutt made the run
herself, securing a pood claim few
miles south of Hunnewell.
She then obtained a divorce from
Tlunnieutt and lived ailone in Iter little
house for six years, up to the time of
her death.
