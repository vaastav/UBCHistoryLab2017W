"Infamous Resolutions."
Mr. Wood, of Now York, introduced
.cr Ui in resolutions into the lIotine a few
hiys ago, reciting the assumed advantages
Ltcly achieved by the Federal arms, and
teclnring the preauut a favorable time to
nitiato meamirea for the coiixummatiou of
leaco. The Bepiiblican papers designato
hese resolutions "infamous." The iufer
inl spirit which animates ICepublican lead
Ms, is palpably manifest in this. They
love to spill blood. They delight in car
nage. They gloat with satisfaetio over
lesolated fields and ruined cities.' The
wail of orphans is music to their ears.
The sombre weeds ol widowed wives is
to them a delightful spectacle. It must be
so. Wo can account in no other way, for
the fiendish hatred which they evince to
ward all who speak of peace, or who
seek to initiate measures for the termina
tion of war. Tt is their study to protract
ibis horrid couilict. They have done
everything that men could do to prolong
it. They havo removed, little by little,
veiy inch of ground upon which ft Union
nan in tho South could stpnd. They
Iiavo united the whole Southern people in
death struggle for their lives, tlieir prop
erty, their homes and firesides. Why?
Because a war upon the South gratifies
.tbeir hatred ; it feeds their rs venue: it
gives them oflice ; it fills tlieir pockets.
What matter if it is exhausting the North
as wall as the South of its young, .gallaut
mauhoitd ? What matter if it is tilling
the whoh) land with widows and orphans,
and imposing a taxation upon the people
which must practically make slaves for
ever of the masses ? No matter at all.
The nion who lead and control tho Repnb
can party, do uono of the fighting, Buffer
none of the afiliction, endure none of the
hardship of this terrible strugglo. It
pives tlium oflice. It clothes them with the
pomp of authority. It enriches them be
'yond the wishes even' of avarice. Hence
they cry : On with the war. Hence they
cull peaoe measure! "infamous," and do
nounrv as Vtraitora" or "peace scoundrels,"
all who seek to terminate this hideous,
rniuous, and most unnatural strife
Republican Hypocrisy.
Republicans, long since, prostituted
the leligion ofCuitinT to partisan purposes.
The Church, with all its vast influence
fcver the minds and action of men, was
transformed into a society for tho dissem
ination of Republican ideas. It proclaim
ed a little of the gospel of Chiiist mixed
with a great deal of the gospel of (iuiisi.sY.
Republican sermons were preached on
Sunday; Republican prayer-nieeting held
tn week days; Republican caucuses assem
bled in the class room; while Republican
resolution and platforms, were scattored
broad-cast over tho land in the shape of
fwligioua tracts, and godly books.

Letter from Hon. Mr. Vallandigham.
Ighain.
The tallowing autograph letter from Hon.
C. L. Vallandigham was received by the Com
mittee of the Sanitary Fair, of Cincinnati, on
Monday last: i
WmnsoR, C. W., December 16, 1803.
George MeLaughlin, Eq., Cincinnati, Ohio:
Sis Yours of the 1 1 1 fa. reauettina- from
me an autograph letter, for the benefit of the
Sanitary Commission, has been received, and
cheerfully comply.
1 be object ot the Uommiuion is one of
mercy. It is a cbanty truly Christian to visit
the sick, to heal the wounded, to minister to
the maimed, to comfort the afllictcd.to relieve
tho prisoner, to clothe the caked, to feed the
hungry, to give drink to them who are athirst,
to cheer the widow and the fatherless, to save
human life, to alleviate human suffering, and
thus to reatore some part of that which war
always so largely subtracts from the sum ot
human happiness. That all this is to be
wrought out on behalf of those or the fami
lies of thoio who brave wounds and doath
with heroic courage, upon the many battle
fields of this most sorrowful of wars, gives bat
still more of value to the same merciful pur
pose, ine uommisaion, ll justly, lairly, with
integrity and without partiality, it shall per
form its pious duties, will prove itself worthy
of all the noble praise bestowed hv liurke
upon the benevolent lloward.
Very truly, L .

[From the Boston Courier.]
A Minority President.
The New York Timet thinks it "rennenant
to the whole principle of uopular representa
tion," and that it "di recti traverses the in
tent of the Constitution, tor the House of
Representative to contain numbers elected by
a party now in a minority in the States from
wluvh they come. Bays that "radical con
servative' print:
"There are at least forty men sitting in that
House who bo more represent the present sen
timents of their constituents, on the real issues
of lbs day, than if they had been elected tea
years ago. 'Thoy are every day voting there
in absolute contradiction of the sentiments of
a majority of thoir constituents as declared at
the last elections. To call them Representa
tives is a mockery. They are misrepronenta
tives out-and-out. They perfectly well under
stand it, and yet it does not afl'eot their pub
lic conauci a parucia. were there but ten
more of them they would have the power to
array, aud without the least hesitation would
array, the so called popular branch diad
aiiaiust the administration, although the peo
ple themselves have just pronounced for the
administration by majorities almost unprece
dented in our political history."
If this is all granted, and the system of
eiecuous uuuer wnica it can occur is conce
ded to be wrong, we are curionitoknow what
the Timet could say in defense of the course
and position of a minority President like Mr.
Lincoln, and of the system under which he
was elected.
War Department.
Secretary Stanton insists in his report that,
the ignorant, shiftless contrahendi who are
now being forced into soldier-clothes are quite
as good as the white yeomen and mechanics
who have won all our victories, aud that they
are entitled to the same pay, bounties, rations
and treatment He therefore wishes Congress
to put the whites and negroes upon a perfect
equality in every respect. We trust Congress
will do no such tiling. We deny that the few
skirmishes in which Ike negroes were engaged
prove them to be as good soldiers as the
whites. The facts are all the other way. Un
til an army of negroes defeat or hold their
own against an araiy of white Houlbsruera we
insist that the question is at least aa twn
one. '
To claim that the indolent, servile negro is
the equal in courage, enterprise and fire to
the foremost race in all the world, is a libel
upon the name ol aa American eitizea. Nor
is there more business-justire in the claim.
In no part of the North will the labor of the
black man eommaud as high a rate of wages
as that of the white man, for the reason that
he is not so energetic, etlicient or skillful. It
is unjuBt every way to the white soldier to put
him oa level witih the black. -sVw J'ori

Unassisted, he gained for himself rlchep and
honors, aud seemed possessed of s'l that the
heart of a man could wish, but ha leavss his
testimony also as to vanity of all things trthi
ly. A passagt in his note book gives us bis
estimate of life: "What is this world? A
dream within a dream. As. we grow tilder
each step is an awakening, ine youth awakes
as he thinks, from childhood ; the full grown
man despises tht pursuits of Jyouth as vision
ary; the old man looks on manhood as a fever
ish dream. Is tha grave the last sleep 71 No;
it is the last and final awakening." I
The gravoe of the Krskines are neat by,
and the tombstone tells us that Henry was the
last born of the thirty three children of his
father. Underneath the ruins the gnido led
ut through several dungeons. "Whatdid the
priests want with dungeons?" was the very
natural inquiry of one of our party. "To keep
the refraaotory m.nk-jinorder," was the reply;
"I expect they needed discipline occasionally
like ony body else." i
As we were crossing the river on our re
turn, a Scotch gentleman, recognizing us as
Americans, asked if we had heard of the great
battle in America. "The Feederals have been
getting whipped again," was the rather exult
ing announcement he made, and then ho pro
duced an Edinboro' paper, which eontnined
a few meager details of the fights near Gettys
burg on the first, second and third of July.
We did not rellect much abont ; ruins after
that. If it was true that Meade was whipped,
of course, Washington, Baltimore, Philadel
phia and New York were at Lee's mercy, and
we were inclined to mink that we had better
take the next steamer for home. , By the time
we reached Melrose, however, wo bait dsre
fully, studied and digested the dispatches, and
had arrived at the conclusion that the fight
was not altogether so disastrous as it ut first
appeared, and wt looked with some remains
of interest upon tht rare old abbey there. We
could not take any very remnto llights Into
the misty realm of the l'ast however the
things of the Prettnt were much more aV
sorbing, i .. . , , . i . "!
This abbey waa built ia the shape of a cross
like all these Roman Catholic edifices, and
was very gnnd, it is even in ruins. It was
built about the year 11 OH, and was destroyed
by the English in the wars af the sixteenth
century. Tht walls arches apd windows are
full ot fanciful and delicate specimens of stone
carving, which are only surpassed in Great
Britain by those in Hoslin Chapel. One sees
there wreaths of Dowers, and clustering
foliage, and heads of demons, catyrs, monks
and saints, in every available sport, about the
edifice, outside and in. Brackets on which
once stood beautiful statues, and the canopies
above stilt remain in great numbers, but the
statues are gone, save three or foar. ' One
carving represents an hour ghws, a boll and
a skull with the inscription under it "Fiigit
horaDisce mori," aad as wo wero looking
at it, the old clock, high up in the ruined tow
er whose face is almost wholly obliterated by
time; gave point to the motto by ringing out
the hour ot four. -
Our days in Scotland thus ended.
