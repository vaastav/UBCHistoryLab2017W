HOUSE LEADERS BEATEN.
Opposition to Admission of New-
Mexico and Arizona.
I From Th« Tribune Bureau.]
Washington. Dec. 14.— The effort of the House
leaders to bind the majority to vote for the dual
Statehood programme by a caucus, met, with sig
nal defeat this afternoon. Such strong opposition to
t j, e plan to make of Arizona and New-Mexico a
tingle State, regardless of the wishes of the in
habitants of each Territory, developed that it
became necessary to abandon the idea of a caucus
and hold & confrence instead, for to have held
a caucus would have precipitated a bolt. When this
iras done, and it was clearly understood that mem
jjers present were not to be bound by the major
ity. the supporters of the Hamilton Two State
biil wre able to obtain only 110 votes, while the
ppicop'.tion mustered So votes, or eight more than
enough, when combined with the 137 Democratic
vote?, to defeat the measure en the floor of the
House.
The onposition to the two State proposition gave
ev*ry evidence of indignation after the conference
adjourned, and many of them declared that they
will fight to the *>'tier end. It appears that those
In favor of the K.imilton bill occupied forty-live
minutes advocating: that measure and then pro
fed that an adjournment be taken for fifteen
jnisutes, this motion being carried by a viva voce
vot*- almost before the opposition appreciated its
j^sUeance. When the question of adjournment
otle disposed of 'here remained only eight minutes
In which those ooposed to the measure could ex
press tn-iir views. ttJe was occupied by Repre-
Kntative Adan;s. oi Wisconsin.
Although the conference broke up with the linea
sharply drawn, and a sufficient number of Repub
licans voting against the two State proposition to
insure its defeat, it is regarded as unsafe to pre
dict that the bill will not pass the House, because
it is possible that the leaders will be able to bring
« fufficient number of Republicans into line to se
cure a majority of the House. The conference
voted unanimously for a measure which should
grunt Statehood to Oklahoma and Indian Territory.
Bffere taking up the question of Statehood the
conference elected Representative Watson Repub
lican whip, vice Representative Tawney, now chair
man of the Appropriations Committee, and also
gave a vote of thanks to Mr. Tawney for his effi
cient ajid faithful service as whip.
Senator Beveridge is confident that if the House
iriU send over a two-State bill reasonably early In
the session he can secure its adoption by the Sen
ate although the leaders of the Senate do not re
gard the prospects for the passage of a Statehood
Mil without the Foraker amendment as reasonably
certain. Senator Foraker's amendment provides
that Arizona and New-Mexico shall not be com
bined in one State until a majority of the voters
In each Territory have approved the proposition.
If the Committee on Territories snould decide to
accept the Foraker amendment, the bill would
probably pass the Senate without opposition
It is asserted by these who favor the two-State
proposition that there is a powerful lobby at work
'a Washington to prevent its passage- that this
lobby is composed of the owners of railroads and
Bines in Arizona, which are now taxed at an In
finitesimal part of their value, and that these men
oppose Statehood for Arizona for the reason that,
were that Territory combinej with New-Mexico in
a gineie State, it would be practically impossible
"or them to control the legislature, and the as
sessed value of their properties would i>e enor-
TTjOuslv increased. - ' _ ,
leather argument advanced by the advocates or
the two-State proposition is that, were Arizona
admitted to the Union alone, the Mormons would
have the balance of power, whereas, were the two
Territories combined, the Gentile population of
the new State -would be sufficient to render the en
tire Mormon vote within its borders Innocuous
va-.v of the members of the House who voted
ajndnst the two-State proportion to-day did so
Wttn the conviction that neither Arizona nor New-
Mexico is ready for Statehood.
WHIPPING POST FOB WIFE BEA.TEBS
Mr. Adams, a Bachelor, Will Beintroduce
His Bill.
[From Th» Tribune Bureau.]
Washington. Dec. 14.— Representative Robert
Adams, of Pennsylvania, the father of the bill
establishing the whipping post for wife-beaters in
tie last session of Congress, is preparing to intro
duce his measure again, and had a talk with the
President about it to-day. President Roosevelt.
E Adams said, assured him that he is as warmly
in favor of the bill this session as he was last.
The only obstacle that now seems to be In the
■way of the introduction of the bill is Mr. Adams's
ba&hfulness.
-You see," said Mr. Adams after his talk wit&
the President this morning, "I am a bachelor, and
this fact was seised upon by my brother members
and by the newspaper editors throughout the coun
try as an excuse for extracting a great deal of
fun out of the thing at my expense. They Bald
that if I was a married man I'd have more sym
pathy with wife-beaten, and all that son of
thirg Why, even the members of the District
Committee— my bill, you know, was limited in
operation to the District of Columbia— asked me
if I would hav< introduced the bill if I had been a
married man. and wanted to know how 1 was
competent to judge of the provocation that often
causes a man to beat his wife. Of course, I can
takf ■ ioke as well a? any man, and can laugn
at it. even it it is at my expense, but. really, this
it no joking matter. We lock up thieves and thugs
and murderers and all kinds of ordinary criminals
and gladly Fiipport them in the jails and peniten
tiaries, because by so doing we protect ourselves
from their violence or depredations. But it is dif
ferent with wife-beaters. If we lock them up for
terms in jail, what is in* result? Why. we have
to pay for their board within the prison walls
and frequently are obliged to support the. unfort
unate families who are deprived of their natural
support on the outside of those walls. '"
"If you'd only get married, Mr. Adams, perhaps
th" fun-making would stop." suggested one of the
Congressman's friends. '■/■ . ■.■
"I may be driven to that. " replied the bachelor
father of the whipping post bill.

A MAXIMUM TARIFF BILL
Mr. McClcary Will Soon Introduce
Su>ch a Measure.
i From The Tribune Bureau. !
Washington, Dec. 14.— A maximum tariff bill
will be introduced In the House in the Immedi
ate future by Representative McCleary, of Min
nesota, who was recently appointed to the seat
vacated by Mr. Tawney on the Ways and
Means Committee. Mr. McCleary's bill will be
substantially the same as the maximum clause
of "the maximum and minimum tariff bill" re
cently Introduced in the upper house by Sena
tor Lodge, and will be proposed as an amend
ment to Section 3 of the Dingley Act, which
now contains provision for limited reciprocity
agreements to be put in force by proclamation
of the President and for retaliatory duties to be
put in force in like manner when the President
Is convinced that the products of the United
States are not being Justly treated.
The first s«x;tion of Senator Liodge's measure,
which Mr. McCleary will adopt, provides that
when any country discriminate against any
article or articles the growth or product of the
soil or industry of the United States by levying
on such articles a duty in excess of that im
posed on similar articles from other countries
there shall be levied on imports from such coun
tries duties? a certain per cent in excess of the
duties now established by law. The second sec
tion of the Lodge bili, which is dropped by Mr,
McCleary, who disapproves it, provides that
when the products of the United States are ad
mitted to any other country on the* terms ac
corded to the most favored nation, the products
of that country shall be admitted to the United
States at a corresponding per cent less than the
rates established by law.
Mr. McCleary, in proposing the first clause of
this bill as an amendment to the Dlngley law,
names 25 per cent, authorizing the President to
declare the goods of any nation which shall dis
criminate against those of the United States
subject to an increased duty of 25 per cent over
the Dingley rates, such increase to go Into effect
through a proclamation of the President.
Mr. McCleary points to the fact that this in no
way involves any diminution of the Dingley
rates, but does provide the United States with
a weapon to be used against those countries
which may by their tariff legislation discrimi
nate against this country and grant more fa
vorable terms to the products of other nations.
Mr. McCleary believes he will be able to secure
the support of the Ways and Means Committee
for this measure and that it will command the
approval of the House leaders to an extent
•which will procure and its ultimate adoption.
It is regarded as probable that were the bill
offered by Mr. McCleary to be sent to the Sen
ate. Mr. Lodge would accept it as a substitute
for his measure and that a majority of the
Committee on Finance could be induced to re
port the bill to the Senate. Whether the Senate
could secure the passage of such a measure is a j
question. If sent over from the House late in i
the session it would unquestionably be talked j
to death by the minority, but if Mr. McCleary ;
can secure its consideration and adoption by I
the House early In the session it may stand a j
chance of final enactment.

CANAL AND INSURANCE.
Those Questions Discussed in Senate
and ■ House.
Washington, Dec. 14.— The Senate spent four hours
to-day in discussing the Panama Canal emergency
appropriation bill, arid when it adjourned the bill
was BtlU under consideration. There were sot
speeches by Senators Teller. Scott and Morgan,
and they were followed by a general debate, in
which all phases of the controversy werj exploited,
including the question ef salaries, the control of the
Panama Railroad and the necessity for geneial
legislation. Mr. Allison, chairman of th<s Com
mittee on Appropriations, expressed the opinion
that Congress should take tip the .juestion of
salaries in connection with other "ami legislation.
He also said that the status of the Panama Kail
road should be made the subject of legislation.
Messrs. Teller. Scott and Morgan expressed dis
satiHfaetlon with the conditions .r. Panama, but
all indicated a determination to support the sup
ply measures necessary to secure ;he construction
or the canal as at present undertaken. ,Vr. Teller
advocated a sea-level canal: Mr. Scou spoke in
support of the San Bias route as preferable to all
others, and Mr. Morgan expressed the opinion that
nerore the Panama Canal is completed another
canal will be necessary to do the business required.
A separate bill regulating the issue of bonds for
me canal and placing them on the same basis as
other government bonds was passed without <>-
bate. ,
Mr Klklns made a statement from the Committee
on Interstate Commerce, expressing the opinion
mat the committee would present a report within
a reasonable time.
Debate on the recommendation in the President's
message regarding insurance regulation occupied
the attention of the House again to-day. The
pending resolution refers the question to the Ways
and Means Committee, and in its defence Mr.
Payne, the chairman, made the argument that the
only way Congress could control insurance was
through taxing it. The liberal rules of debate al
lowed long speeches, which went off on other sub
jects more or less intended for home consumption
and applicable to particular localities.
HUNT FOR STAMP THIEF.
Clerks Help to Blake Up $500 -Loss
in Wall-st. Branch of Postofflce.
The inspectors of the Postofflce are straining
every nerve to find the Derson who stole $500
in stamps from the Wall-st. branch of the Post
office several weeks ago. The unusual activity of
the inspectors in the financial district yesterday
and a secret visit paid to the Wall-st. branch led
to numerous rumors on the street that "something
was doing."
The robbery is said by experts to be one of the
most peculiar that the inspectors have, had to
unravel in some years. It was not committed by
any one in the department, but by a shrewd, cal
culating thief, or by a clerk sent to purchase
stamps.
Bernard Lynch, a cashier at one of the whole
sale windows in the Wall-st. branch, was wor
ried sick about the loss. Lynch, who has been in
the department for many years, is an expert in
the wholesale business. Several weeks ago he
opened his window for business with an unusual
supply of stamps. The sale of stamps in the Wall
st. district totals some days more than $4,500.
There were about fifty men and boys in line at
Lyncb's window, all holding currency for the
amount of stamps desired. Lynch forgot to turn
the lock on the square class door which 't>ep
arates him from the "line-up," and the thief must
have seen this. On the right side of the window
was a roll of 25,000 two cent stamps and some odd
cents.
While Lynch was busy getting stamps of another
denomination the thief pushed the window open,
slipped his hand in, and the next moment the roll
of stamps was gone. Lynch missad the roll toon
after, but the thief was gone, and all the efforts
of the Postofflce inspectors to get the slightest cliw
have so far been unavailing.
Lynch was stunned when he saw his loss. He
reported at once to the superintendent. The em
ployes of the office held a meeting, unknown to
Lynch, and subscribed a sum that took more than
half the burden off him. Lynch is deeply grateful,
but does not discuss the case, one way or another.
Neither would the clerks admit that they had ral
lied to his aid.
An official of the Wall-st. branch said yesterday:
Lynch is aJi honest fellow; the employes knew
this, and they would not be men If they hadn't
stood by him. There was not a moment lost in as
suring Lynch that the employes would stand by
him.

shall make an attempt to get them. I shall insist
upon the rights which Judge Eason granted me in
the trial of the divorce case, at Wooster. The whole
matter is in the hands of my attorney, and he will
undoubtedly go after the children if they are miss
ing."
K. S. Wertz. of Wooster. Captain Taggart's at
torney, arrived in Columbus to-day to confer with
his client. "Mrs. Taggart lias ried with the chil
dren," eaid Mr. Wertz, "and she is now in con
tempt of court. When we get ready to go after
the children, however, we will have no trouble in
locating them and securing their return."

academy, refused to consent to their return to
that Institution,
Dr. W. G. Vanderveer, the father of Midship
man Vanderveer, called at the Navy Depart
ment this afternoon to confer with Secretary
Bonaparte on behalf of his son. He did not see
the Secretary, but left a letter for him setting
forth his wishes.
HAZING INQUIRY BEGINS.
Coffin Summoned by Court — Cooper
Still in Hospital.
Annapolis. Md.. Doc. 14.— A searching investiga
tion into the hazing of Midshipman Kimbrough . by
Midshipman Coffin until he fainted from exhaustion
is being made by the Naval Academy authorities.
Commander Magruder, aid to Superintendent
Sands, said to-day that the investigation had been
placed absolutely in the hands of the board of in
quiry, of which Lieutenant Commander Durrel Is
senior member, and that this board would thor
oughly investigate everything connected with haz
ing and would then report, the result to the super
intendent.
Commander Magruder said further that it was
the intention of the authorities here to Investigate
the matter to the fullest extent and to deal dras
tically with !t. with a full determination to stamp
out the custom, which he branded as a disgrace
to the academy.
The seeming determination ,is not only to Investi
gate the cases of Kimbrough and Cooper, but to
go to the bottom of hazing at the academy. The
opinion Is expressed officially tnat the investipa
tion may last for two or th#ee weeks. Tli«^ board
of inquiry wrs In session to-day, and examined
Midshipman Coffin.
Both Midshipman Kimbroug-h and Midshipman
CuojjiT, who are patients at the academy hospital,
are reported as improving-.
Dr. G. W. Vanoeveer, of Mount Holly. N. J.,
father of Midshipman Vandeveer. whose dismissal
from the Naval Academy has been recommended
by Superintendent Sands for his alleged failure to
report the condition of Midshipman Kimbrough
after he had been hazed, arrived here to-day and
had a long Interview with the superintendent, In
which he earnestly protested against the dismissal
of his son. After the interview Dr. Vandeveer
went to Washington to present a protest, as he
said, to Secretary Bonaparte.
Cooper, whose right side and vocal organs be
came suddenly paralyzed in the classroom yester
day, persists in the statement that he was not
hazed, but the academy authorities are investigat
ing the case. So far no evidence has been adduced
to show that Cooper was hazed.
It was learned from official sources to-day that
the hazing of KJmbrough was even more brutal
than at first supposed, more dangerous in its nat
ural results and more blameworthy in its origin.
He was undoubtedly h;ized because he testified,
under compulsion, before the investigating board
and implicated some upper classmen. For this it
was threatened by upper classmen that they would
kill him, and he is still under that threat, repeated,
it is said, since the occurrence.
NOT ON DUTY AT HAZING.
Midshipman Whose Dismissal Was
Recommended Explains.
Mount Holly, N. J., Dec 14.— Midshipman Warren
A. Vanderveer, in a letter to his parents received
here to-day, states that he was not on duty Tuesday
night at the time the hazing occurred at Annapolis
Naval Academy, for which his dismissal has been
recommended by Rear Admiral Sands.
The midshipman, who is accused of failing to re
port the hazing which resulted seriously to a first
year cadet, Jerdone P. Kimbrough, says that the
hazing was done in the watch before he was placed
on duty, and that he knew nothing of it till the
case had been investigated by the officer in charge.
That portion of Vanderveer*a letter which deals
with the hazing Incident js as follows:
They have been making investigations into haz
ing, and one "plebe" told. I came on duty last
night on his floor, and when I inspected for ab
sentees, an upper classman who was in his room
told me that this "plebe" had nearly fainted and
that he was trying to fix him up. I didn't know
why he had fainted and di.ln't think it serious, so I
didn't report it.
The officer !n charge inspected later, and, on find
ing the "plebe" in bed. made an investigation and
found out that some one had been hazing him.
The, officer In charge asked me why I didn't report
the matter. I told him I didn't know the cause of
it and didn't think it serious enough. He reported
me to the commandant for deliberate neglect of
duty and as being unfit to po on duty.
I was up before the commandant, and he said
about the same things and said he would recom
mend me to the superintendent fur dismissal. H»
relieved me from duty, and 1 am under suspension.
That to, I am confined to my room a_nd not allowed
to go out for drills or on duty.
The hazing didn't take place while I was on duty
and T didn't know a thing about it. The worst I
thought they could do to me was to report me and
give me fifty demerits. But they have gone ahead
and recommended me for dismissal.
MACCRACKEN DENOUNCES HAZING.
Chancellor Angry at Recent Occurrences at
New- York University.
chancellor MacCracken of New-York University
looked thoroughly angry when he appeared in
chapel yesterday morning, and he soon made it evi
dent that the reports of the conduct of the fresh
men In attacking the sophomores in overwhelming
numbers were responsible for his wrath. The at
tacks furnished the chancellor with the text for a
spirited attack on all forms of hazing in which one
man Is the victim of several opponents. He prom
ised that the whole affair would be investigated.
The freshmen who were reported to have been
tied to the furnaces of the Vendome were mqcli
amused at these reports. They were walking down
Broadway in a body at that time, led by their

The report that the freshman banquet is to be held
at Relsenweber's next Tuesday night was also
received with great interest on the campus. It is
saf( to predict that the dinner will not be held at
Reisenweber's next Tuesday, for the fact of the.
date having leaked out would be enough to cause
a postponement.
MRS. NAFTAI/S SERVANTS SUSPECTED.
Asbury Park Murderers Got $1,000 in Cash
and Jewels Worth $3.ooo— Reward Offered.
! By Telearapti Ml The Tribune. 1
Asbury Park. N. J.. Dec. 14.— One thousand dollars
in cash, a pair of diamond earrings, worth $1,000,
and four diamond rings, valued at $2,000, were the
booty of the murderer of Mrs. Morltz Naftal early
yesterday morninsj. The money and Jewelry were in
a chamois bag, whioh the dead woman always
wore. Her husband gave her $500 in cash Just before
he started for New-York last Sunday, and he told
the police to-day that his wife had another iaHO
in the chamois bag when lie left her for the last
time.
The murder is baffling the local and county de
tectives, and two central office sleuths from New-
York will be here to-morrow to assist them. The
Common Council, in special session, this afternoon,
recommended that Mayor Tenbroeck offer a reward
of 11.000 for the arrest and conviction of the mur
derer or murderers. This will be done, and the
Naftal family will offer an additional reward of a
like sum.
Chief of Police smith believes that the murder
was committed by former servants who knew that
the dead woman always carried her jewels and
money on her person, and that the husband was
absent. A post-mortem examination, made by JL)r.
Samuel Johnson and Dr. W. W. Beveridge. revealed
that Mr*. Naftal had been chloroformed.
No arrests have been made: William Matthews,
a colored lad, who frequently assisted Mrs. N:iftal
in housecleanlr.g. was put through the "third de
gn-€»" to-day by Chief of Police Smith, but the ex
amination called to connect him with the crime.
uni he was allowed to depart. The coroner's In
quest will b« held on Monday.
Mr. Naital reached here from New-York this
morning. Via four sons accompanied him. He had
been In -«^/-*,iork to arrange for renting apart

ELECTRIC
HEATING —
and COOKING
ELECTRIC heating of large area* is not as yet
commercially practicable. But for taking the
chill off small rooms, for foot warmers and a
merely incidental service it fulfils every expectation
For cooking or laundry service, no electric device
is now lacking. Folly a hundred are on the market.
They include chafing dishes of every design; French
coffee pots: waffle irons; hair curlers; shaving cups;
portable stoves of all sizes; the heating pad, super
seding hot water; smoothing irons from the one
petite for handkerchiefs to the great tailor's goase;
plate warmers ; doctors' and barbers' sterilizers.
The list is too long to be fully given here
Most of these devices take the place of the ordinary
incandescent lamp in the socket, and thsir use costs
an insignificant sum. A chafing dish can be used for
15 minutes for 1% cents. Dangerous alcohol i*

in His Will

Pittsburg, Dec. 14. — The will of Captain 8. S.
Brown, the turfman, was filed to-day, and dis
poses of about $2,500,000 worth of property.
His relatives admit that immense holdings were
disposed of outside the will by personal be
quests. One of theso bequests is known to have
been $100,000 for the building of a church in
memory of his mother.
The turfman in his will asks his brother and
principal legatee to fill all stake events for the
year 1906 and then sell his stables. He wishes
the name of Brown to pass from the turf.
Late to-night a strange feature of the will be
came public. It is dated November 22, 1905. or
less than thirty days before death, as required
by Pennsylvania law, in order that all Its be
quests be valid. This opens the way for litiga
tion, but Captain Harry Brown said to-night
that there would be no trouble.
