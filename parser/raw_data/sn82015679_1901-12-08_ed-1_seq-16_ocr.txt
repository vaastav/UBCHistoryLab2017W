During the past three years the Socialists
liave practically controlled the city gov
ernments of Haverhill and Brocton, in
Massachusetts. At the election last Tues
day the Socialist party was repudiated in
both cities as the result of a full vote and
of limited experience. Socialism is a line
topic for a speech, but in practice it is
doomed to failure, even when the less radi
cal of its ideas are tried.
The "Woman's National Indian Society,"

The New York World says the endeavor
of the President to lift all national ques

ered the temperature of debate." That is,
the manner in which the FreM.Ient treated
public questions has not roused partisan
passion, but has been followed by ti ni
perate criticism and fairness. If Congress
could follow the Trci-ident'.s example: and
thu'j lower the temperature of debate the
country would bo pleased.

THE LAW AM) 1'IIII.IC OPINION.
A spirited discussion is g'.dng on in New
Y'ork over the proposition to so change the
excise law that saloons may be legally
open a part of Sunday for the sale of beer
and wine. Under the Raines law any house
having a given number of beds is a hotel
and may k-H liquors to guests. Very natur
ally, the Haines hotel is a synonym for a
low groggery. During the administration
of Mayor Strong an effort was made to
close all the saloons on Sunday. The op
position aroused was one of the causes of
the return of Tammany, to power in 1S07.
Since that time no effort has been mad2
to close the saloons on Sunday. Mayor
elect Low and the new county attorney,
Mr. Jerome, are in favor of a law that will
legalize. the sale of wine and beer during
a portion of Sunday. Bishop Potter and
many other conservative men who are ear
nest reformers, advocate the same policy.
Perhaps the most zealous advocate of the
proposed change Is the Itev. Dr. Rainsford,
who led the crusade a few years ago
against vice In the Tenderloin district and
furnished the evidence which implicated
the leaders of Tammany in a conspiracy
to shield vice and crime by sharing the
profits with the keepers of such places. In
a recent interview Rev. Dr. Rainsford
said:
I am opposed to the saloon?. I wish I
could shut them all up; but it is simply
nonsense, the worst sort of nonsense, to
believe that in a city which, next to Ber
lin, is the greatest German city in the
world, we can shut up the saloon on Sun
day. This is the deliberate judgment of a man
of positive and even radical views, who has
had the courage to assail the stronghold
of vice in New Y'ork city. For what he has
done he is more hated by those who profit
by vice and crime than any other man in
the city. He fought the battle courageous
ly, but in doing so ha3 come to the con
clusion that in the interest of public mor
als it is better to legalize saloons on Sun
day than it is to have them operated in
defiance of law; better to license them
under stringent regulations which will
compel decency than to ignore them and
allow them to become brothels. "If you
legislate ahead of the public conscience
you defeat your ends," is the deliberately
expressed judgment of Dr. Rainsford. The
enforcement of law under our form of gov
ernment depends largely upon public senti
ment. An unpopular law can be enforced
for a season, but at the next election the
law will either be changed or officers will
be elected who will not enforce it. In the
opinion of a large number of intelligent
men who desire the best things in govern
ment, laws affecting the public morals
should not be more strenuous in their pro
visions that the average public opinion or
conscience will sustain.
It is the judgment of many of the most
thoughtful observers that one of the most
dangerous tendencies of the times Is disre;
gard for law. Statute books contain a great
many laws which have come down to us
from remote times when lawmakers bor
rowed their ideas regarding what laws
should be from the letter of the Old Testa
ment rather than from the spirit of the
Sermon on the Mount. Some of these laws
have been practically repealed by being
treated as obsolete, and would be forgotten
did not some revengeful lawbreaker in
voke them for a few days to punish his
persecutors?. There are other laws, how
ever, which the en tiro community know to
be violated with impunity. To this violation
of law and the evils growing out of it, Rev.
J. dimming Smith, pastor ef the Taber
nacle Church, of this city, called attention
in his Thanksgiving sermon. He referred
to the violation of the license law in this
city, and, in effect, declared that the effect
of the knowledge of the violation of the
liquor laws Is more to be deplored in the
consequent disregard for law than the vio
lation of the law itself. He also had the
courage of his convictions and expressed
the opinion that in order to have the liquor
traflic under control of law, the adoption
of the Swedish system, under which the
government practically directs the sale of
intoxicants, was desirable. The Tabernacle
preacher does not favor this plan because
he is in favor of liquor-drinking, for, if he
could havo his way, he would put an end
to the practice. Unfortunately, ho cannot
have his way; furthermore, lie recognizes
the fact that a large part of mankind In
dulge in intoxicants and that the desire to
indulge cannot be cured by legislative en
actment. Under such conditions he would
labor to convince men of the evils grow
ing out of the use of intoxicants and place
the? traffic under such reasonable legal re
strictions that it will inflict the least injury
upon society. To him a general disregard
of a few laws will lead to the disregard or
disrespect of all laws, and that leads to
anarchy. Men who courageously and
thoughtfully take this position are sure of
being denounced by other men who. unfor
tunately, cannot or will not consider any
important question in all its bearings.
Tili: TENACITY OP HACK.
Ths Prussian government, after its very
thorough manner, has been working many
years at the task of Germunizing the Poles.
The people whose country bore the name
of Poland still cling to the national lan
guage and customs as tenaciously as when
the country was "partitioned" among its
neighlors under the pretense of tranquiliz
irtg Europe. At the present time the grown
Poles are prevented from holding meetings
as Poles, and the publication of newspa
pers in the Polish language is forbidden'.
Prussia Is also trlng to educate Polish
children as Germans, but with indifferent
succ ss, because the father and mother in
culcate Polish traditions before the hi!d
conns in contact with the German school
teacher.
Just now" Germany is having trouble in
the schools In a Polish district. Germany
decides what the child shall be taught, and
attendance is compulsory. The government
decided that religious instruction .should be
givn. The .state religion is Lutheran, but
the Poles are Catholics. The result is that
tho children Live no heel to the religious
teael Inc. tellimr tho teachvr that they
are Pules and not Germans, and do not
want to be taught tho "German religion."
A teacher whipped Polish children in the
school in Wrcschcn ln-cause they would not
be taught the national religion. Thertupon
the parents broke hi i:on the school exer
cises, made a disturbance, were arrested
and sent to prison to the numbt r of twenty-live.
The disturbance has spread in the
Polish section of Prussia and towns are
resisting the school regulations and other
wise offering opposition to German author
ity. Germany is making an attempt to make
a Grman of the Pole in the beim mat
when the change shall be wrought there
will be no Polish inlluence to intrigue and
agitate for the old Polish nationality. The
Pole understands this and refuses to bo
made a German. There is no hope for the
restoration of Poland. Doubtless the Polish
leaders understand it, yet a national sen
timent which is only a remembrance to the
present generation i3 fiercely alive in
Prussia, Russia and Austria. The con
tention will doubtless break up the empire
of Austria-Hungary Then the present Em
peror shall die, but whether Germany or
Russia undertakes to rule the Poles they
will have a difficult task, since there is a
Polish race, a Polish history, a Polish lan
guage and a war-like people to perpetuate
all. Great Britain's rule over Ireland haa
been less arbitrary than that of Germany
over its portion of Poland, yet the war of
races is continued. Even with an almost
forgotten lang-uage the Irish people keep
alive their traditions of nationality to
which they yet hopelessly aspire, and will
resent British rule, be it never so mild, so
powerful Is the influance of race.
IIA1LHOADS AMI COAL llOAUS.
Indiana is now so gridironed with rail
roads and this city has been a railroad cen
ter so long that it seems almost Incredible
that there are persons living who can re
member when there was not a mile of rail
road in the State. Any person seventy
years old or past can recall that period.
The system had its first beginning on paper
in 1SC1, but It wa3 several years after that
before there was a mile of operating road
in the State. In that year six railway lines
were chartered by the Legislature to ex
tend from different points, mainly on the
border of the State to Indianapolis. They
were the Lawrenceburg & Indianapolis, the
Madison & Indianapolis, the New Albany,
Salem & Indianapolis, the Harrison Sc. In
dianapolis, the Lafayette & Indianapolis
and the Ohio &. Indianapolis. During the
next four or five years considerable money
was spent in surveying and grading por
tions of these lines, but only one of them,
the Madison, was partially completed by
1S3G. In that year thi internal improvement
mania led the State to embark in railroad
building. By 1SU the Madison road had
been completed with a flatbar to Vernon,
and it was several years before it got any
farther. In it was leased to a Madison
syndicate for CO per cent, of its receipts,
and in IS 12 it was sold to a new corporation
and was completed to this city in 1517. For
several years it was the city's only railroad
and the only outlet and inlet between the
central portion of the Slate and the river.
For a few years it did a great business,
though financially embarrassed. In IS32 its
stock sold for $1.C0 and in 1S5G it had sunk
to 2j cents on the dollar. This slump in
the stock was due to extravagant manage
ment and the growing rivalry of new lines.
In March, lSt)2, the entire road was sold by
the United States marshal for $C23,(mX). The
Jeffersonville road, which was not one of
the pix chartered In 1SC1, was begun in 1S4S,
completed to Edinburg in 1S52, reaching In
dianapolis from Edinburg over the track of
the Madison road. The old Bellefontaine
road, now the Bee-line division of the "Big
Four," was chartered in ISIS, opened from
Indianapolis to Pendleton in 1SÖ0 and to
Union City in 1S.12. The Vandalia, original
ly called the Tcrre Haute & Richmond, was
chartered iu ISIS and completed iu 1SC2. Tho
present generation will scarcely believe
that there was no direct railroad connec
tion between Indianapolis and Cincinnati
until IsjI, but such Is the fact. Prior to
that the favorite route was by rail to Madi
son and from there by river to Cincinnati.
The original charter of the Lawrenceburg
Indianapolis road, granted in 1SC1, lapsed
and a new one was granted several years
later. The building of a road to Cincinnati
was fought by the Madison interests with
vicious determination and was doubtless
delayed several years on that account. It
was finished from Indianapolis to Law
renceburg in and the next year, by
means of an "accommodation rail" over
another roadbed connection was made
with Cincinnati. The Indianapolis & La
fayctte road was begun in and finished
in 1S32. The Indiana Central, now a part of
the Panhandle system, was organized in
1SC1 and completed to the eastern State lino
in 153. The Peru &. Indianapolis, chartered
in lb 10, was finished as far as Xoblesville
with flatbar In 1"1 and to lVru in i
It was not equipped with T rail until after
Its completion to Peru. The Indianapolis
Cincinnati Junction, now the Cincinnati,
Hamilton & Dayton read, was begun in di
visions between Hamilton and this city in
lS"i, but was not completed to this point un
til 1m'. It is one of two roads that te
ceived a subsidy from the city, it having
received $15,000 and the Yincennes road $00,
0J0, both en condition that their shops be
located here. The Vinccnncs road was fin
ished to this point in The old Indian
apolis, Woomington t Western road was
opened in 1SC7 and the old Indianapolis &
bt. Louis In is,G;. 1 rom the foregoing it
appears that nearly all tho railroads now
entering the city were constructed duiinj
the twenty years from 1S10 to ly.'ü. Severa
of them traverse the coal fields, but for
some reason or other the problem of cheap
coal has not yet been solved. There is n
coal in the world so easily accessible and
so cheaply mined as Indiana coal, and none
better for making steam on account of Its
freedom from sulphur and its burning with
out coking. Situated as Indianapolis is
with reference to the coal field, it should
have had cheap coal long ago, and woult
have had if any nr." of the railroads which
traverse the real full had treated the citv
as liberally as tiny were treated by it
Wb.at the city needs now is cheap transpor
tation. There is not another city in the
United States located as near Inexhaustible
fields of coal that can be cheaply mined but
F.ets cheaper e-.al than this city does. The
lesson of the past is -that mere multiplicity
of railreads to er through the coal region
Is no guaranty of cheap coal. There mu
be a distine tive. ceal road or a road through
the coal field pledg.-d to be managed in the
interest of the eity.
The School Board is wise in calling a hal
In the collecting cf money from the dudIIs
of the public schools. No fault can bo
found, perhaps, with asking the children to
contribute to the Harrison and McKinley
memorials, but now that this has been
done the line should be drawn ami no fur
ther demands made on them. The rule
against such collections was formerly ob
served with much strictness, but within
the past few years it has been broken sev
eral times, and the tendency has been
toward laxness in regard to it. Many
teachers object greatly to making such re
quests of their pupils, knowing as they
do what a struggle it is for many parents
to keep their childern properly clothed and
equipped for school. In such families
every penny counts, and when the desired
contribution is withheld the child is sub
jected to a humiliation and embarrassment
which authorities should have made un
necessary. Even a man or woman does
not like to be put in a position where his
or her poverty ia made apparent, and by
a child such experiences arc borne with
difficulty.
The circular note which Superintendent
Kendall has sent to teachers in the eighth
grade anel high schools, suggesting to those
who teach "current history, civics in the
broad sense, and English," to make use of
portions of President Roosevelt's message,
is an innovation which can be heartily corn-
mended. In his circular Mr. Kendall calls
special attention to the portion of the mes
sage devoted to the assassination of tho
ate President McKinley, anarchy, the re
striction of immigration, the forestry re
serve and like topics. He proposes to ac
complish three objects, namely to test the
pupil's power to read, to give instruction in
civics and current history, and as an ex
ample "of the use of pure and forcible Eng
lish." Teachers are cautioned against dis
cussion cf controverted questions, such as
the tariff. There is so little of this In the
message that It can be made a study with
out inculcating partisanship. There is rea
son to believe that Mr. Kendall's novel sug
gestion will be received with general favor.
Chicago has a juvenile court over which
Judge Tuthill presides. Under the law
which established the court and its methods
of procedure hundreds of boys who were
sent to jail a few years ago are now taken
care of by charitable organizations and In
stitutions. Recently the Chicago Commer
cial Club and Union League Club became
Interested in this work, and a large sum of
money is already pledged to establish a
rural refuge for delinquent boys. This in
stitution Is necessary to make the juvenile
court law effective. The fact that under
the juvenile court law only twenty-four
boys have been sent to jail during the two
years It has been in power, compared with
1,70" tent to prison tho three years just
before its establishment, will give some
idea of tho good work that law has made
possible.
A . prominent commission merchant and
fruit dealer who is in a position to know
whereof he speaks tells the Indiana Hor
ticultural Society that in the last ten years
$1.OX,0 ha3 been sent out of the State
for arples. An average of ROOO.000 a year
tent out of the State for a product that
ought to be raised at home argues lack of
enterprise or bad management. The fault
is not in the soil, climate or natural con
ditions, all of which, in a large portion of
the State, are admirably adapted for fruit
culture, ard especially for apple culture.
It lies with the farmers and land-owners,
who have allowed the early orchards to
decay without renewing them. The situa
tion is not a creditable one, and should
not be allowed to continue.
The annual meeting of the Indianapolis
Charity Organization this evening in the
English Oiera House will be devoted' to
brief addresses by those who are connected
with tho different institutions and organi
zations devoted to the care and education
of children who would be homeless but for
these organizations. The subject is, per
haps, the most important feature of 'charity
effort, since, to tho extent that it Is suc
cessful, those who would grow up to lives
of dependence and worthlessness are cn
listeel on the side of the self-supporting and
the law-abiding. The rescue of children
who would be vagrants or the inmates of
poorhouses is the most effective war which
can be made upon the 2 per cent, which
constitute tho dependent and criminal
classes.
The report that the transcontinental
railroads will not strive to prevent the
passage of a Nicaragua canal bill seems
not to be correct, as the companies are
opposing the ratification of the Hay
räuncefote treaty.
Editor Bok explains laboriously and at
the cost of much space in his excellent
tamily magazine, that there are many ad
vertisements for which he could get big
money, but which, because they are not
perfectly high class and proper, he simply
refuses to publish. He then goes on to any
that he mentions these facts merely to
prove one thing, namely, that the Insertion
cf illustrated corset advertising in his per
iodical "is not based on financial consider
ations. Right or wrong, it is lure because
of an honest conviction of the department
which governs such things that it should
be there." In other words, corset ads are
in because the coarse, vulgar business de
partment which does not share the edi
tor's delicate scruples considers that they
are all right money no object, of course.
What travail of soul the poor man musl
endure every time he looks over the pages
(f his magazine and allows his eyes to
fall on those shocking pictures!
A Cincinnati man writes to a paper of
that city complaining that when for pa
triotic purposes he went to a dinner given
for a suitable price by the Daughters of
tho American Revolution, his tenderest sen
sibilities were shocked by seeing the Hag
of tho free, the sacretl emblem of his coun
try and theirs, hanging in the window up
side down. "Will you kindly Inform me,"
he asks plaintively, "where one is to hok
for reverence to the Hag if not to tho
Daughters of the American Revolution,
y t they hang the starry emblem wrong
side foremost." This rash and dull-witted
man probably did not stop to consider that
the arrangement of the flag, of which he
complains, was made on a basis of be
comingness to some one under its folds.
or nocause it seemed more arusin? in a
reverse form. And what is mere custom
or what one side ef a Hag rather than
another when artistic effects are con
cerned ?
Mr. Henley's reevnt article on Robert
Louis Stevenson Las stirred up a great
rumpus among the admirers of the latter,
and doubtless Mr. Henley was Indiscreet
and displayed Kol taute; nevertheless, a
good many persons who enjoy reading
Stevenson's Works, but are not able to join
In tho Immoderato adulation which has
been heaped on him, will incline to the
belief that the criticisms of him may have
a good effect in bringing about a fair and
just estimate of the man. As one writer
put it: "The wise world will accept the
candor of one friend as at least as valu
able to the plain truth as the gush of his
teo-heaellong aelmirers and quoters and
shibboleth-mongers. For a long time it
has been difficult for people who really
admire Stevenson, but with sanity, to open
their mouths."
Senator Cullom's effort to secure from
Congress an appropriation with, which to
build a suitable memorial to Abraham Lin
coln at the national capital should re
ceive attention and approval. It is rather
strange that no serious move in this direc
tion has been made before. With the ac
tivity displayed in the erection of statues
and other memorials at Washington to per
petuate the fame of a host of smaller men
it would seem that a monument to honor
the name of this great President would
have had its foundation laid before now.
Lincoln's fame needs no pile of stone to
make it sure, but the country owes it to
itself to offer proper tribute to his memory
in the capital, where his services to the
people were performed.
A dispatch from a neighboring town, giv
ing an account of a runaway marriage,
asserts with unconventional frankness that
"the two young people have been very
attentive to each other for a long time."
It is so much the custom to assume that
all matrimonial overtures are made by the
man in each case that, although every one
knows the truth to be often quite other
wise, It is rather startling to see the fact
put so bluntly. "She" frequently "pays
attention" ardently to the object of her
choice, but the world chooses to regard
her, when tho attentions culminate in mar
riage, as the person sought for.
If you see a professional-locking young
man or woman gazing intently at you in
the street cars or other public place do
not be In haste to assume that they are
admiring you. They may be studying your
physiognomy and its lines as a guide to
the "make-up" of the villain of the next
play. That at least is the custom of many
of the stage people when planning new
parts, according to one actress lately in
terviewed. New nickel coinage soon to be Issued
in Belgium has each piece pierced to make
them more convenient for business, the idea
being that they will be strung like Chinese
and Japanese money. Belgians should be
warned to leave their strings of money at

The publishers of "Bob, Son of Battle,"
and the artist-photographer were put to
straits to secure the pictures for a new edi

the theme of "Bob" is largely built upon
the famous shepherd-dog cup trials of the
north of England, which occur only in the
lako region near the Scottish boreler. Mr.
Dugmore crossed the ocean in 1) to secure
the pictures, but cloudy weather during the
whole of his two weeks' stay made it im
possible to get any result. Last summer he
visited the scenes cf "Bob" again during
the cup trials for this sole purpose, and
his success is amply shown in the new edi

PERCY LYSSHE SHELLEY.
)r..Vii I))' e-'i Estimate f Iii t Intr
uder Iii (ironing; l'ourr.
Brooklyn Eagle.
The; subject of Dr. Van DLe's Brokln
Institute lecture, e!elieied last -eidrg at
Plymouth Church, was "Shelley," it 1 i:.g
the third iu his series on "English Litt ra
turo." The church was till d :.s for t!ij
Sunday scrlce and the audience was iaoi
appreciative.
Dr. Van Dyke said the subject was one
which he upproached with feeling of eleap
misgiving, bt cause of the aguo intangi
bility of Shelley's charactex. "Sumo
sounds," said the lecturer, "are easy to re
cord in a phonograph. But there is diffi
culty in recording the summer breeze in
the treo tops or the w hispering of waves oa
the shore. Shelley's character belongs ta
the class symbolized by theso lighter
sounds." Matthew Arnold said Sh lley was
.a writer, whose words were "beautitul ani
Insufficient an ar.gel, beating in the lumin
ous void his wings In vain." Shelley was a
poet's poet, yet this was not what he him
self wishe! or intended. He hoped to move
the multitude with new inspiration anl
aspiration, but this hope was Ineffectual,
ami ho felt that it was so. The title, pe-et's
poet, shows both his strength and his
weakness and i3 recognized as sue h by
most of th critics, Including the American,
George lMward Woodbury, whom Dr. Van
Dyke called tho best critic of Shelley,
thoußh one who speaks from the side of
admiration.
In the ten years in which Shelley wrote
the most, he did not succeed in doing what
he wished to do. but what he might have
elono had he llvel cannot be predicted.
Certainly, his work was deepening with
each year. His limitations were defective
form, obscurity an 1 in.eoherene-e of expres
sion; lack of intellectual substance, for.
while poets inrhaps elo not net d views,
they, must have; a point of view; lack tf
sympathy, that is of an understanding of
the fee ds of humanity, fcr, though he was
warm-hearted, he had no compt-hensio!i
of the real soul of the race. His min!,
at the time of h's writing, was lu a Mate
of transition, it was passing from the
atheism of his youth toward theism and
faith. It was quick, but not clear; ardent,
but not powerful.
It was the fashion in those days to sym
pathize vith the Gr-ek.. One ,,f sh lb y's
poems is on "Hellas." S, that he might
bereun' letter acquainted with t'n r al
Greek, instead of the Greek of his imagina
tion, one e.f his frit nds tof'k him to the
wharf at Ilhorn, where a Gre k ship ws
lyli.p and a party e.f Greeks were sau.tt t ii.g
on the deck, shrieking, sweating, gambling,
lying, filthy and thoroughly knavish. "Well,
does this remind yeu ef Hellas?" said h.a
friend. "No, but it does of hell." said
Shelby, and urgel his friend away from
the ship before his ideals should be shat
tered. Shellev was born In 17:'2 of good family,
"that is," said Dr. Van Dyke, "his grand
father was made a barone t while the bty
was at school. Th old man was worth
about i::Joo"". which he mole by a wisely
conducted preeess of eloping with heiresses.
That is what biographers call a good family
in Englan.l." His lather, Timothy Shell y.
was a thick wittei country squire, "an
egregious ass. as near as 1 can make out."
Here follow l a description of the man. w ho
was anything but choice a regular Philis
tine. In re-spect to this parent. Shelley was
as unfortunate as Byron was in ills moth
er. "And. ladies and gentlemen," said Dr.
Van Dyke, "speaking of fathcrhoe'.l and
motherhood and what is proper for it,
much of tho quillty of fitherh-od nod
motherhood depends entirely on th moral
it v of the father and mothe r. I don't know
whether this is a poi ular remark, and I
don't much care."

"They met a troop of long-haired, strong
