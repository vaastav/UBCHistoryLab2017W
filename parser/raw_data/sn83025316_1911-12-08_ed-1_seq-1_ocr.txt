Hdelna; I swas not called belpre the

me in Helent. Therefore, I can say
nothing l bout the reasons for the ac

for me to say anything about them:
By *the terms of this letter it is as
eumed that T should remain to Sep

President Duniway left last night for
'Spokane. To, a Missoulan .reporter he
said that, further than he had dis
cussed the matter in, faculty smeeting,
he had nothing to say, resgding the

surprise and no little regret expressed.
The Board's Aotion.
Charles H. Hall, the Missoula mem
ber of the state board of education,
was seen last night by a Missoulan
reporter and was asked if he would
not, in view, of the fact that President
Duniway had i sde public the action of
the boar, bireak the, silence which has
been mnaitainpd by its members since
the ei e)laa eetingt, .
"I had nbt intended to say alyting,"
said Mr. all "In .fact, 'the member;
of the board agreed that there. should
be..no discussion of the affair by them
selves after the ,meeting.. Bat. g Dr.
Duniway has announced. the aetion. of
the board, I see no reason why I
should not speak.
"There was no strife in the board
over the matter, which was discussed
at length, but without any spirit of
dissension. There were two or three
long speeches made by. older members
of the board, Each sneaker pal. the
highest tributa to the high ssholar
ship of Dr. Duniway and. to l is sin-.
cemrity and earnestness of ptirpose. High
regard was expressed for him person
ally.'
"'The point upon which the board
acted in passing .the resolution was
that Dr.. Duniway's administrative
ideas do not agree with ,what .the board
considern hiiuld be the policy of the
state .university and that the impo.
sibility of avoiding friction between
himiself and the board had become ap
