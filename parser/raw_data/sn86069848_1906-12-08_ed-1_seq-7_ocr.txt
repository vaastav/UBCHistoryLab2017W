ICYRIL SCOTT IN THE
w1HEI
The Prince Chap exactly as
presented by Manager W N Law
rence at the Madison Square and
Webers theatres New York with I
Cyril Scott as the star will be
seen at the Capital Theatre next
Thursday evening December 11
for one performance only The
two clever children Helen Pull
man and Edith Speare as origi
Wally will share in the perform
anco of little Claudia a parti
cularly unique role in stageland
requiring as it does three different
actresses for a complete portrayal
of the character graduating from
childhood to womanhood In
Act I Claudia is five years old in
Act II she is eight and in Act III
she has passed her eighteenth
birthday Here is novelty to com
mence with The child interest
has been voted superb being the
motif of a story that is replete
with the sort of heart interest
that is fascinating to every grade
of playgoer One of tho critics
in New York wrote that The
Prince Chap from the last row
in the gallery to the first of theI
orchestra struck a chord of sym
pathy that won universal re
sponse Those who saw The
Prince Chap either in New
York or on the road the produc I
tions being identical will need no
urging to witness it again It
conies with all the promise of
being a sincere success the style
of play that lives on its deserved
popularity requiring nothing
but the opinion of those who haw
seen it to insure its welcome
Genuinely good plays are very
scarce here we are told is one of
the scarce ones In spite of all
prejudice it has scored in Lon
don it will run in the English
capital a year and it will require
two extra companies to tour the
English provinces It is to be done
in Paris in Berlin in Vienna
pruofVe
We can only have one company
touring the United States and
Canada Contracts call for
Cyril Scott and the original pro
production
duction so the performance will
be the equal of that witnessed on
Broadway It is often written
ofa star that he has scored the
hit of his career in each succeed
ing part he plays Cyril Scott
may not have made the biggest
success ho is destined to make
but according to Mr Edward
Peple the author of The Prince
Chap he has recreated the char
acter of the artist he plays with
out regard for the hero of tho
novel as Mr Peple sketched him
making him infinitely more at
tractive more interesting nnda
man that the world of theatre
goers can not fail to admire and
love
Supporting Mr Scott are such
well known artists as Messrs Wal
lace Erskine Charles B Wells
Donald Weldon Duane Wagar
George Sohaoller Misses Fran
cose Neilson Florence Conron
Mary Keogh Edith Speare Helen
Pullman and Justina Wayne and
the original New York production

PRESIDENTS MESSAGE
Conceded by All Parties to be One
of the Albest Ever Sent
to Congress
On Tuesday last President
Roosevelt sent in his message toI
the short session of the 50th Con
gress
It is quite a lengthy document j
requiring two hours and a half
for its reading
It begins without any perfunct
ory introduction and treats of all
1
the subjects considered in a man
ly straightforward way that com
mands the respect and admiration
of everybody whether in his ownj
party or in that of the opposi
tion
At its conclusion the applause
was spontaneous and overwhelm
I
ing and from both sides of the I
House of Representatives
Rarely has a President so fully
met the views of men of his own
party and at the same time
earned the approval of his oppo
nents
No subject was treated in a per
functory way but each and all
were handled in a thoroughly and
conscientious manner There
is no uncertain sound to any de
claration
There are some carping critics
of course whom nothing that
could be said by any living man
would satisfy but even these not
having the gall to try and contro
vert the positions assumed yet
must cavil and they assume a
wiseacre air and assert that the
President is sermonizing Let
those carpers take heed and obey
the truth as it is shown to be the
truth
