A. man must ltam to take tho-o
things good naturcdly. He never
knows avton ho N going to have to
rail on tho t friendship of Uio other
brokers. A floor broker must stand
good for his mistakes nnd they arc
huro to bo mnde. One sold a slock
at 21 ono day when tho market was

35. Tho moment he had leconled the
deal ho looked at bis order and
caught the mistake. That ten points
represented some $2000 and ho stood
to make that good to the firm. What
did he do? He couldn't afford that

had sold the stock to and begged off.
They were good fellows and saw tho

there aro some mistakes no brokrr

Judgment. Mistakes In execution of
orders may be remedied, but no trader
is going to let some old scalper out
of n deal when Jio guessed wrons
on onio stock and it went down in

though tlrcro are men who have the
nerve to ask you to cancel an order
like that.
'A mistake like that shows the big
risk a broker takes. That ono stood
to make a couplo or dollars for car

stood to lose nearly $2000 .by simply
misreading the order. New men envy
