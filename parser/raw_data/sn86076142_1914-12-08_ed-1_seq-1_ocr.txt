WASHINGTON, Dec. 8. President Wilson departed from the prepared text of his annual address
in contra and devoted his remarks principally to answering thoBe who contend the United States is
not prepared for national defence, to give notice to the business world that the legislative programme
of the administration, as affects the regulation of business, is practically completed. He said this had
resulted in a clear road for business to travel to "unclouded success." Honest business, he said, need
have nothing to fear in treading the way. He outlined trust and currency bills. a

Gentleman of the Congress:
The session upon which you are

I will long be remembered for the

of production. In Europe it is de

have always found means to do that,

necessary without calling our people
away from their necessary taska to
render compulsory military service
in time of peace.
From the first we have had a clear
and settled policy with regard to
military establishments. While we
maintain our present principles, we
shall never have a large standing
army. If asked, are you ready to de
fend yourselves? we reply, most as
suredly, to the utmost; and yet we
shall not ask our young men to spend
the best years of their lives making
soldiers of themselves.
We must depend in every time of
national peril, in the future as in the
past, not upon a standing army, not
yet upon a reserve army, but upon
citizenry trained and accustomed to
arms. It will be right enough, right

these mistakes and omisBlons, even

of money saved in that way would, I
believe, though not considerable in
itself, running it may be Into the
millions, be relatively small small,
I mean, in proportion to the total
necessary outlays of the government.
It would be thoroughly worth effect
ing, as every saving would, great or
small. Our duty is not altered by
the scale of our saving. But my
point Is that the people of the United
States do not wish to curtail the
activities of this government; they
wish, rather, to enlarge them: and
with every enlargement, and that
with the growth of the country Itself,
there must come, of course, the in
