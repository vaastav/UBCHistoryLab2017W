PEACE TERMS OF COUNCIL
Paris. Dec. Oeiiiuiliy lias de
cided nut to Nlgn the protocol pre
sented here by the allies as a condi
tion for putting the peace treaty Into
effect, the peace conference has
been notified. . , .
Tills attitude Is taken as continu
ing reports of a sharp reaction in
Ormany within the last fortnight.
Trained observers of Ocrmau devel
opments expressed to members of
the peace conference the view Hint
there has been a complete Iransfor-
malloii of tlie situation in (iermany
and that It Is due to the failure of tin
Hutted States senate to ratify the
peace treaty.
These observers declare that while
a vast majority of Oerhians before
the senate's adjournment desired the
treaty rutlfled as soon as possible
they now are supporting the govern
ment's attitude In resisting the do- '
mand of the allies for Indemnity for

REJECT ALL HARD ROAD BIDS
WILL HAVE ANOTHER LETTING
The county commissioners reject
ed the bids for the hard surfaced
roads from Abilene to Detroit and
from Hope four miles east on th
ground that they were too high and
that they exceeded the engineer's
tiniate. W. S. Scott engineer of tlie
state highway commission was here.
New bids will bo advertised at once.
The concrete road contractors did not
show up, the brick men having the
whole show. The commissioners
want to hear from the others as well.
The "brick men (only two firms
bidding) also submitted bids on con
crete but were not anxious for this
work. They claimed that figures are
going higher and that increased cost
of material and labor since the en
gineer's estimate accounts for the
difference. The bids wore:
