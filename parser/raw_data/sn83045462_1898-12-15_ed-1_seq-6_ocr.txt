1 he Spirit ??1 the I nion.
Th? i>opular Idea has always been that
had Rutland at?d France agreed upon a
poll* of intervention in our civil war the
result would have been a dissolution of the
In ion and the formation of a new govern
ment by the southern states. Those two
powers w? re exercised only about our cot
t? n. They cared nothing about the slavery
qrestioa, and nothing about our republican
form of government. But the blockading
of southern p??rts by the federal authorities
cut off their supplies of raw c otton and put
th< ir niiils on short commons. Hence the
proposition about intervention, which, it
was thought, would solve the difficulty.
May wt not. in the light of recent events,
now revise that long accepted view of the
matter? Might not foreign intervention,
for a reason so palpably selfish, instead of
widening our differences have healed them?
Might not the two warring sections of the
country h ive been brought together as
against the foreigner who did not really
care for either? Was it too late for them
to adjust all difficulties and hold together
on terms of honor and advantage to both?
Th.- war had been in progress less thnn
two years. It had been begun with reluct
ance. On the southern side were many
m'*n who loved the I*nion. General ?ee,
who h id served so long in the old army,
quitted it with regret. On the northern
side wer<- many men who loved the south.
Mr. Lincoln never harbored any bitterness
in his h-^art at any time. He was always
for peace provided the integrity of the
Tnion was guaranteed. Who shall say,
therefore, that foreign intervention, instead
of prolonging the struggle ami in the end
disrupting the I nion, might liol have ap
pealed to the strong love of country and
kinship in every American bosom, and have
pleaded for a cessation of the domestic
strife?
It Is all the merest speculation. The for
eigner held off. and we fought it out at
fearful cost between ourselves. But the
spectacle presented during the past eight
months stroi.gly suggests that there never
has been a time since the Union was
formed when the foreigner could safely or
successfully thrust himself into our affairs.
Bitter as our domestic contentions some
times are, as against the outside world we
are one.
In Silver Doomed?
Mr. Bry n still holds to silver, but in
putting himself at the head of the anti
expansi inisis he necessarily assists in the
subordination of the older issue. Is lie
executing another of his skillful maneu
vers?
Mr. Bryan entered national life as a tariff
reformer. He was elected to Congress on
a platform drawn in accordance with the
views of the Carlisle school. The tariff
was then the foremost question, and he ad
dressed himself to it as a member of the
House. His ability was promptly recog
nized. He waj? assigned to the ways and
means committee, and the speech which
first attracted attention to him was the
or e he delivered in support of the Wilson
bili. it was regarded by the tariff re
formers as an effort of unusual excellence,
and I hey were at pains to distribute it all
over the country.
Tiie Wilson bill ciid not settle the tariff
question by any manner of means, but
served only to make it the more acute. It
fell far short of the democratic promise of
lsirJ. and it proved disastrous to man)
American industries. The fight, it was
plain enough, must still go on. But Mr.
Bryan's interest in the subject waned. He
turned his attention to silver, retired from
Congress, toured the south and west as a
lecturer on free coinage, and appeared at
the democratic national convention at Chi
cago .n lsw; with a speech on that subject
wtuch sec ured him the pre sidential nomina
tion of i*= i>artyv The tariff though still
unsettled, wi's completely subordinated, and
silver tor that campaign was made the
party's sfxiboo.ef b.
is Mr. Bryan, though still declaring for
silver. s*-cretiy convinced that there is not
another presidential nomination in that
question'* Is he ready to turn fropi that
as he ; :rne l from the tariff question? Has
he uttered h.s new cry in the sentence that
this country cannot exist ha.lf vassal and
half fre.-? Is ne preparing for and promis
ing himself nn imitation i.incoinia n role ?
In view of existing political conditions in
the section of the repabii ? which furnishes
the bulk of Mr. Bryan's supporters, is there
not sonu- suggestion of a boomerang in the
denunciation of vassalage as dangerously
inconsistent with the foundation principle
of this 5 nd of the free? May not the popu
lar apprehension of peril to the republic
f: m an imagined possible future vassalage
in the Philippines increase to vast propor
tions if diverted to and based upon a pres
ent practical vassalage developing eaneer
iik. in the very vfttahi of the national body
i olitic?
What this country needs just now Is the
removal of obstructions in New York har
bor .?r I' it?r pilot service for government
\esst Is visiting that port. As things have
be? n going lately our battle ships seem to
be in ^r -ater peril in time of peace than
ii. ? ...u. mt rsts with the enemy.
The Central American states merely got
tog- her long enough to shake hands fur
annh i bout.
The Merchant Marine.
The ?mrSm r,f rehabilitating the Amer
ican merchant marine is more pronouncedly
kotforoi ( feogn *s at this session tluui ever
before The President has called atten
tion pjint? lly in hi- annual message to the
lieed of increasing the* fleet c^f auxiliary
cruisers, which in time of peace shall be
engaged in commerce. The Secretary of
tk !. usury, in hi^ annual report, has dis
t usst <1 thi question from the point of view
of an arly necessity to increase the num
ber of ships under the American flap which
r, i> ' * atM for the government's pur
poses in lime of war. The Postmaster
taeneral. in his rejiort, also refers to the
matter, showing the* need of more vessels
similar o the St. Paul, the St. Ixiuis. New
York and Paris, both on the Atlantic and
the Pacific. The National Board of Trade,
now in session in the city, has passed res
olutions calling attention to the need of new
laws which will strengthen the American
merchant fr..rine.
Congr??39 cannot fail to observe the forco
of the arguments which words and events
combine tc advance in behair of the ship
ping Ihe war showed that invaluable ser
vice can be rendered by the swift ships of
it r.. ns-i>c<-anlc lilies, converted into cruis
er!" for scouting and patrol purposes, and
even, under st>me circumstances, for actual
lic'ntinir. Had there been a squadron of
su-. h ships on the l'acllic side as well as on
the Atlantic, it is not to be questioned that
the military and naval problems presented
bi Hawaiian annexation and the occupa
tion of the Philippines would have been
mich easier of treatment. The four ships
pressed into service from the American line
were of great utility. Had their number
been quadrupled the government could
readily have utilised them.
With the extension of the territory of the
United States come new demands for ships,
which must be met by means of govern
mental aids such as have already been ex
tended. Secretary Gage discusses the sub
sidy question as embodying several well
delined necessities, including the extension
of the existing laws and the enactment of
new ones which shall conform to the
changed conditions growing out of the war.
He proposes that the vessels which shall
enjoy the government's grants shall in re
turn train men for the auxiliary navy. The
war showed that there is serious need of
seamen accustomed to service under mili
tary discipline. If a merchantman can be
utilized to train men in the handling of
gurs, on stated occasions when the men
shall be told off for this purpose, the navy
will find a valuable nucleus for a reserve
force which will prove of value in a cam
paign.
The Postmaster General urges this mat
ter in his report, calling attention to the
services rendered by the four ships of the
American line during the war, and he notes
that whereas progress has already been
madf in the Atlantic and the Gulf of Mex
ico, nothing has been accomplished in the
line of mail subsidies in the Pacilic. It is
evident that there lies the most serious ne
cessity of all, in view of the annexation of
Hawaii and the occupation of the Philip
pines.
( IonIhk tlie Hreacli.
President McKinley's speech at Atlanta
yesterday afternoon is destined to become
historic in the record of the reunion of
the states. Aside from the ovation which
he had received prior to its delivery, out
of the enthusiasm of the people over their
chief executive, the words which he spoke
expressive of a desire for a truly national
Memorial Day suggest that a long step
has been taken toward the final closing of
the breach between the sections which has
been steadily narrowing year by year
since the close of the war. The war with
Spain did more than any previous event to
bring the peoples of the two sections neaYer
together. A new Americanism was born
which has thriven and proved an element
of great national strength, teaching Eu
rope a lesson which it will never forget, the
lesson of the homogeneity of the American
people.
Now comes the President of the United
States, a veteran of the civil war, a sol
dier of the north, a republican, represent
ing in his personal capacity all the tradi
tions which were and are opposed to dis
union, and he says to the people of the
south, in his executive capacity: "The
time has now come when we should share
with you in the care of the graves of the
confederate soldiers/' He spoke then from
the northern point of view, as evidenced by
his use of the pronoun "we." It was the
c?>ll of the new brotherhood of the Union,
the voice of the patriotism engendered or
reawakened by the war with Spain. There
is little wonder that these words electrified
his hearers and continue to startle the
people of the whole south as they realize
that a northerner and a union soldier, fill
ing the office of President, has extended
the right hand of fellowship and has pro
posed to honor the graves of the men who
fell while lighting to disrupt the Union.
President McKinley has evidently taken
this st^p deliberately and hopefully. He
doubtless appreciates fully the fact that
despite the taik of reunion for the past two
decades the memories of tfee war have been
cherished by the generation which person
ally participated in the struggle and have
in large measure passed to the generation
following. The sharp line of demarka
tion between the northern and the south
ern observances of Memorial Day has con
tinued to indicate the survival of undesir
able bitterness. If now some advancement
can be made toward a joint recognition of
that event, the President evidently be
lieves, steps will have been taken to close
the gap permanently.
The grand meaning of that day will not
be lost by such an innovation. It will
rather be accentuated. The day means
union. What could be more significant of
union than the joining of hands over the
graves of the men who died in the struggle
betw- n the sections?
President McKinley has shown his fellow
men of the north, with whose ideals he
full} sympathizes, the true way to vic
tory over prejudice. While the south is
cheering his words the north should be
echoing them.
If Admiral Dewey finds it needful to re
turn home he will leave his Manila affairs
in such shape as to afford no encourage
ment whatever to Admiral Von Diederichs.
Calm consideration must enable Cuba to
appreciate this government's desirs to put
ih? plant in good working order before
turning it over to the rightful owners.
Col. Bryan and Senator Hoar cannot be
swerved from th ir Opinions even by the
embarrassing discovery that they are
agreeing with each other.
IA Hung ('hang will regard any steps to
ward an understanding between England
and Russia as a severe blow at a very
1 rotitable business.
Admiral Dewey is perfectly content to let
the score card tell the story, without taking
eft his hat to applause from the grand
stand.
The Chinese government would be im
mensely interested in any peace confer
?nces between Anglo-Saxons and the Rus
sians.
New York prides itself on the excitement
it can offer and its system of building in
spection does much tc justify such a senti
ment.

In this era of geographic revision Presi
dent McKinley may succeed in obliterating
a few imaginary lir.es from the American
map.
Mrs. Botkin of San Francisco is still too
much absorbed in her trial to make the
usual prt pu.rutions for going on the stage.
President Faure doubtless hopes that the
peace commissions will return to Paris in
l'JUO and bring their fri?nds.
The Spanish government would probably,
be in favor of a peace jubilee if Don Carlos
would consent to participate.
President McKinley appears to be en
j gag d upon a very effectual and dignified
I peace pilgrimage.

1m Robert* a Citizen f
From the St. I'iiiil Pioneer Press.
The Salt J-ake Tribune takes the ground
that Roberts of Utah is not a United States
citizen, since he ceased to be one under the
Edmunds law, which disfranchised polyg
amists, and he has never been restored
to citizenship by accepting the new condi
tions. It is a point worth testing for those
who are making an active campaign against
the would-be congressman.
I.ay the Pacific Cable at Once.
From the New York Journal.
It makes no difference whether Hawaii
and the Philippines are three thousand,
eight thousand or ten thousand miles away
if we can kfep in hour y touch with them
by cable. The telegraph annihilates dis
tance. Let us have a Pacific cable at once,
and let the government lay it and own it.

Merry Christmas. Johnny Bull!
'Tis a feeling rather new
To have hearts so very full
Of affection, stout and true.
It is pleasant to forget
Various things that vexed of yore;
Leaving tempers quite upset;
Things that rankled sharp and sore.
Somewhere on the distant sky
Clouds, of course, may form anew;
Treaties drawn n days gone by, \
Boundaries drawn somewhat askew,
Some time may obscure the plan
Which of joy seems now so full.
But, be jolly while we can.
Merry Christi as, Johnny Bull!
Our Protectorate Over the Wenk.
From Case and Comment.
A white mob terrorizing black men with
arson and murder in North Carolina; a pri
vate war between desperate miners and
reckless employers in Illinois, while their
governor m ikes an infamous threat to meet
workmen from another stale with Gatling
guns; the long list of Turk-like outrages
by our own people on Chinamen, Italians
and other defenseless foreigners; the up
rising of Indians against the oppression
and corruption of government agents; the
destitution, suffering and partial exter
mination of Alaskan communities because
of the unfitness of our government over
them?make a sardonic comment on much
of the .ofty buncombe about extending the
blessings of oar civilization over far-distant
and semi-barbarous people. A duty toward
helpless peoples thrown into our hands by
the fortum s of war must not be shirked,
but it is attended with the grawst responsi
bilities.
If the official positions in the government
of these new dependencies, with all tlieii
opportunities f>>r oppression and robbery,
shall be treated as prizes or spoils of party
victory, we shall have the shameful record
of our Alaskan ru e and of the "century of
dishonor" in our Indian relations repeated
and magnified, to our unspeakable disgrace
among the nations. The operation of such
;t feudal system of politics would make our
protectorate of weaker nations in the name
of civilization result in a scandal abroad
and a n"w source of corruption at home.
To avoid this it is imperatively necessary
to have some bureau or department for ter
ritorial government with a system that ut
terly repudiates the "claims" of political
job-hunters, and makes unquestioned fit
ness for a position the sole test of appoint
ment. A law to take this branch of our
government i>ut of the reach of intrigue,
"pu.ls" and illicit influence would be the
best service that any American statesman
can at this time render to his nation.
The Xcw \mlianM!i4lorMlii|iM.
From the Mexican Herald.
The government is to l?e heartily com
mended fur promoting the Hon. Matias
Romero, so long tin- minister of this repub
lic at Washington, to the rank of ambas
sador. It is a timely recognition of the
growing importance of Washington, as a
diplomatic center of influence, an indica
tion that Mexico is aware of the appear
ance of a new world power, and it also is
a proper assertion of the dignity of this,
tin- premier Latin American nation, the
most prosperous of ail the Latin countries
of the new world, and the one enjoying the
highest credit in the money markets of the
world.
Mexico's diplomatic representative at
Washington wi 1 now rank with the am
bassadors of the European powers, and
certainly the new honors conferred on the
diplomatic representative of Mexico will be
worthily borne by the accomplished states
man who by his intelligence and friendli
ness has won the good will of the ntire
American people. Minister Mariscal has,
in this important act, displayed a tine sense
of the fitness of things and has seized the
psychological moment fur it. Tact and
sound sense are characteristic of the ad
ministration of Mexico's foreign affairs.
And it is most satisfactory to tin 1 the
United States government icting on Its
intention of raising the rank of the lega
tion here to that of an embassy. It is a
graceful return of Mexico's compliment,
and the place will b- filled in a dignified
manner by Minister Clayton, whose conduct
of American diplomatic affairs here has
been eminently correct.
The ItolM'rtN Contest.
Fi' in tlie Salt Lake Herald.
Speaker Heed is not in sympathy with the
contest movement Inaugurated by Utah re
publicans against Congressman-elect Rob
erts. .
That settles it. The contest is over, so
far as Congress is concerned. The preach
ers may continue their work which I he pol
iticians got under such splendid headwav,
but they will have to go it alone or enlist
the reformers who can find nothing else
in New York or Washington to engage
them at present.
Republican congressmen may as well get
into line and right dress toward the Speak
er. They have "never failed yet. so perfect
is I lie discipline of the czar's imperial guard
and it isn't likely that there will be any
chewing or expectorating in the ranks when
the order is given to fall in.
Sneaker Reed has probably thought the
matter over carefully, concluding that, as
the republicans of Utah made their bed. so
shall they lie. An unnecessary conclusion
sinee that Is what they are expected to do
Whether ihey go to bed or stay uo all nif-ht.
A Washington newspaper correspondent
informs a local contemporary that "there
are many men In Congress and molders
of nublic oninlon in the east who declare
that no polvgamist should be seated upon
the floor of either house."
Any man. bachelor or bigamist, singular
or ldural. who enters Congress and persists
in sit tine upon the floor oiurht to be ejected
chairs are provided for the members. Prop
er deeorum should be insisted upon bv the
sergennt-at-arms.
Our Consular Service.
From the Rochester Herald.
Senator I.odge of Massachusetts, while
earnestly advocating a permanent consular
service, strikes a very important objection
to such a system when he calls attention
to the inadequacy of the pay of our higher
diplomatic officers. There seems no satis
factory reason why. if Congress is dis
posed to make suitable provision for t'he
beccming support of our embassies, we
should not have a diplomatic service as
free from politics as our army and navy.
The prospect of a life-long career of honor
and emolument would attract numbers of
our brightest and most ambitious youths.
A Reflection on the People.
From the New York Herald.
The telephone is as much a necessary of
modern life as the railway is, and it is a
reflection upon the intelligence and the
public spirt* of the people of tfcis city that
they have permitted and still permit them
selves to be mulcted by the "comblw?"
which monopolizes this indispensable means
of communication.

The Practical Lesson Taught.
VISITORS with eyes to see and ears to hear cannot but be
impressed. The great floors with 140x100 feet of unob
structed view, the loftiest ceilings and widest aisles all lessen
the discomforts of holiday shopping to the minimum. The
mighty glass roofed rotunda floods the building with light during
the day and the electric plant creates a brilliant scene at night. The
balcony parlor and bureau of information anticipates and fills
one's every need. The comfort of the Christmas present seeker is
thought of, to the "Shopper's Lunch" at the nominal price of 10c.
And, while now general, the Palais Royal asks credit for inaugu
rating the free engraving of initials and boxing of goods for pre
sentation.
Many Stores Under One Root
MOST complete stores, filled with none but reliable goods.
Twenty years of reputation indorse this statement that is
echoed in every home in Washington?''The Palais Royal
never offers inferior goods in order to create a low price." This
fact is the foundation stone that holds the Palais Royal's ever in
creasing army of patrons.
And Prices Are Least Here. J
This statement, seemingly paradoxical, is perfectly logical? *
because the Palais Royal is the one great department store in ?
S Washington where goods are BOUGHT and SOLD on a cash '<
% basis. Least prices are the logical outcome. The laws of trade say
4 so Husband or son will explain to wife, mother or sister.
