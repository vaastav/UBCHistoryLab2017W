PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE.
Follow Citizens of the Senate
and Uomu f Sfrtuntslhu I
Another year of health and of mffiolutl
abaDdent harvests bti patted. For theee
and apoillv for Iho improved conditio
of our national affalri, onr renewed and
profound grattlade to Ood la dna. We
ramala In peace and frltodihlp with forelga
powera. Tba afforta of disloyal eltlaana of
tba United State to Involve at in foralgn
wart, to aid in Ineiooaable Ininrreotioa
have bean qnavalllog. Her Brltanio Ma-
jeatj'a QoTernment, ai wm JustlJ eipeetad,
have exeroiied their authority to prevent
the departure of new boitila expedition!
from Britiih porta. The Koperor of France
haa bj a like proceeding promptly loiilca
tad the neutrality which he proclaimed at
tba begining of tba eontaat.
Queitioaa of great intricacy and Impor-
tana bare aritea out of the blockade and
other belligerent queationt between the
Government and eereral of the maritime
powera, but they hare been dieeueaed, and
ao far aa waa poieible, accommodated In a
spirit of fraokoeea, juetioa aad mutual
good will. It la especially gratifying that
our priae courta, by tba impartiality of
tbatr adjudication, bava commanded tba
reapeot aad confluence of maritime pow
era. The supplemental treaty between tba
Doited States and Great Britain, for Iba
uppreesion of the African slave trade,
made on the 17 th day of February last, haa
been duly retined and carried Into effect.
It la believed that ao far aa American
ports and American cltisens are concerned,
that inhuman and barbarous traffic haa
been brought to ao and. I aball submit
for the consideration of the Senate a con
vention for the adjustment of posaaasory
claims In Washington Territory, ariaing
ont of tba treaty of the 16th of Jane, 186,
between the United States and Great Brit-
Ian, and which have been the source of
soma disquiet among tba titiaena of that,
now rapidly and improving part of the
oonntry. A novel and important question
Involving the eitent of the Maritime Juris-
, diotion of Spain in the watera whioh lur.
' round the Island of (June, has been da-
bated without reaohlng an agreement, and
it is proposed in an amioabla spirit, to re
fer It to the arbitrament of a friendly power.
A convention lor mat purpose win oa
Submitted to the Senate. I bava thought
it proper to subject it to the approval of
tba Senate, to concur with tba interested
commercial powers in an arrangement for
tba liquidation of the Scheldt dues, npon
tna principles wmcn nave oaen heretofore
adopted in regard to tba imposts npon
navigation In tba watera ot Denmark.
The long peadiog controversy between
. this Government and that of Chili, to urge
tba aeiaura at Silene in Pern, by Chilian
omoera, of a large amount In treasure be
longing to cltisens of the United States,
haa been brought to a eloee by the award
of His Majeaty, tba King of the Belgians,
to whose arbitrament lha question waa
referred by tba partioa.
Tba aubjeot waa thoroughly and patient
ly eiamined by that justly reapeoted Ma
jesty, and although the sum awarded to
tba claimants may not have been aa large
as tnay expeotea, were is no reason to die
trust tba wladom of His Majesty's decision.
That decision was promptly complied with
by Chili when intelligence in regard to it
reached that oonntry. Tba joint commis
sion nnder the not of Ike laat aaaslon, for
carrying Into effect the convention with
Pern on the aubject of olaima, has been or
ganised at Lima, and is engaged in the
bueineae entrusted to It.
Difficulties concerning tnter-oeeanle
transit through Nioaranga, are In oourae
of amioabla adjustment In conformity with
prlnoiplae aet forth in my last annual mes
sage. 1 have received representatives from
the United States of Colombia, and have
oredlted a minister to that republic
Incidents occurring In the progreai of
our civil war bava rorced npon my atten
tion the uncertain state of international
questions, tooohiog the rights of foreigners
in this country ana or united Dixie cm
lens abroad.
In regard to some goveromenta these
rights are at least partly defined by treaties.
In no instance, however, la it expressly
stipulated that on the Instance of civil war
toreigoer residiog in this oonntry, within
tba linea of the insurgents, Is to be ex
empted from the role which classea him aa
a belligerent, In whesa behalf tba govern
ment of bla oonntry cannot express any
privileges or immunities distinct from that
character. .
I regret to aay, however, that such
elaime have been put forward, and, in soma
Inatanoes, in behalf of foreignera who bava
lived in the United 8tatea tba greater part
of their lives. There Is reisoo to believe
that many persons born in foreign coun
tries, who bava declared their intention to
become citiaene, or who bava been fully
naturalised, have evaded the military duly
required of them by denying tba fact,
thereby throwing upon the Government the
burden of proof It baa been found diffi
cult or impracticable to obtain,
This proof, from the want of guides to
tba proper aourcea of information, might
ba supplied by requiring tba olerka of
courts where declarations of Intention may
b made, or naturalisation effected, to send
periodical lists of the names of persons
naturaliaed, or declaring their intention to
beooma cltisens, to tba Seoretary of tba
Interior, la whose department these namea
must b arranged and printed for general
Information.

The right of eutfrag haa often bean a,
turned and exercised by alieee under pr.

into aerlout jeopardy through tba perverse
opposition of the hereditary aristocracy of

to your serious oonsideralion.
I make this suggestion upon the ground
that a comity, which ought to ba recipro
cated, exempt our eonsuls In all other
eountriea from taxation. To tbe extent
thus Indicated the United Btatea. I think
ought not to be exceptionally illiberal to
internatiooal trade and commerce.
The operationa of tha Treasury during
tha laat year have been successfully eon
ducted. The enactment by Coogress of a
natiooal banking law ba proved a valua
ble support of the publio credit, and tbe
general legislation In relation to loans baa
fully answered tbe expectations of Its
favorers. Some amendment may bare,
quired to perfect exieting law, but no
change in their principles or general tcope
is oeuevea to oe neeaea.
Since theee meaturet bava been in oner
ation, all demand on the Traaturr. inclod

promptly met and fully aatliSed. No con.
iderabla body of troops, it 1 believed
were ever more amply provided, mora lib
orally and punctually paid. - And It may
ba added that by no people were tba bur

Satisfactory aad Important as has been
the performancea of the beroio men of the

wonderful than the service ot our mechan
ics and artiean in tb production of war
vessels, which hes created a new lorm

superior to any other nation, In our re.
souroes of iron and lumber, with ioexbaost

Tbe change that baa taken plaoe In naval

duction of I team aa a motive power for
ships of war, demands eltber a correspond
log change In noma of our existing navy
yarda, or the eetablishment of new ones
for tha coaalructicn and necessary repair
of modern war vessels. No Inconsiderable
embarrassment, delay, and publio Injury
nave been experienced rrom tne want
lucb government establishment.
The necessity of inch a navy yard
famished at soma suitable plaoe upon tba
Atlantic eeabord, baa on repeated occasions
been brought to the attention of Congress
by tho Navy D.-parimeot, and is agJio pre
sented In tha report of the Secretary, which
accompanies Ibis eomoiuoiiulioo. I think
It my doty to lovite yonr special attention
to tht subject, aod also to that ot eatab
liabiog a yard and depot for naval purpo
aea upon ooa of the Weetern rivers. A naval
force he been created oo theee interior
watera and uuder maay disadvantages with
In little mor than two year, exceeding
number the whole naval force of the
try at th commencement of th p recent
admlnietratlon.
Th reaouroe of tb nation have been
developed aod It power ditplayed In
oonitruotion of a navy of tuoh magnitude,
whioh ha at tb vary period of ita creation
rendered (ignal eervloe to lb Uolon. Tb
in ore ate of the number of seamen in

of 1681 to about 24,000, at the preeent
time, ba been eooompllined wltbont asps-
oial legislation or extraordinary bouutiee
to promote tnat exercise.
It haa been found, however, that tbe op
orations of the draft, with high bounties
paid for army recruits, I beginning to ef
fect lojuriously th oaval aervioa, and
will, if not eorreoted, be likely to impair
It efficiency by attracting seamen from
their proper vocation and Inducing them
to enter tbe army, l therefore respectful
ly suggest that Congress might aid both
tba army and naval servio by an adequate
proviaion oa this subject, wbioh would
tbe same time Be equitable to tb comma
nitie more especially intended.
I commend to your coosideration the
suggestions of tbe Seoretary of tbe Navy
regard to tbe polloy of restoring and train-
log aeamen for naval service. Tbe Naval
Academy is rendering signal service
preparing midsbipmen lor blgbly respon
sible duties, which, In sfterllfe, they will

in every respeot entitled to the tavorable
consideration of congress.
Doring tbe paat fiscal year, tha financial
condition of tbe Post OIHoe Department
has been one of Increasing prosperity, and
I am gratified In belog able to state that

As a matter oi oivu aaminlsiration the

Tbe constitutional obligation or tba

lender in oanent of mis provision 'only

external to and even within tba State ; and
sucn are precisely tne cases with wbioh
wa are sow dealing. An attempt to guar
aatee aad protect a revised state of gov
erameot, constituted lo whol or io pre
poaderating part from tho very element
against whose hostility and violence It it
to be protected, is simply absurd. There
mutt be a reet by wbicb to separate op
poeiog elements ao a to build only rrom
the (ound, end tbat rait 1 a aufflcient and
liberal ooe which accept a eound who
ever will make a sworn recantation of bit
farmer unsoundness.
Bnt if it be proper to require a teet of
admlaeioa to the political body, an oath of
allegiance to toe constitution of tba United
Slates and to tha Union under it, why not
etao to wo law ana proclamation in re
gard to Slavery t Thoee laws aad procla
mation were enacted and put lortb for tba
purpoaa or aiding in the suppression of the
rebellion. To give tbe elfoot there had to
be a pledge for their maintenance. Ia my
judgment they have aided, aad will further
aid, tba cause for wbicb they ware enlisted.
To giva np thia principle would be not only
to relioquieh a lever or power, bot would

I remain in my preeent position I ihall not
attempt to retraot or modify Ibe emancipa

elavery any peraon who I md fro by

reasons, it is thought best tbat tbe

and raitoration of projected right, which
n naa ciear conttiiutionai power to with

Ithould be obterved aleo, that thia part
or tha oath is subject to the modifying and
aorogating power oi legislative and in
preme judicial decition. Tha propoted
acquieeeace of tba national executive in

view of probably modifying tbe confution
ana aittressea destitution wbicb must at
beet attend all classes by a total revolution
of labor tbronghont the whole Slates. It
it hoped tbat the already deeply afflicted
people in those Siatea, may be tomewbat
more ready to give np tbe cause or their

maae in me nope mat it may do good with

great oonfusion. But why any proclama

tion Is beset with tb conflicting view that
tne aiep might oe delayed too loog lr be
taken too soon. In some elements for re
sumption bava been ready for actloo, but
remain inactiva apparently tor want of a
