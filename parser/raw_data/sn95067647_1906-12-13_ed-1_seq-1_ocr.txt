ANOTHER WRECK
Two Killed and Four Injured at
Danville.
FLAGMAN BLAMED FOR ACCIDENT.
Similar to the Disaster st Lawyers j
Which Resulted in the Death of Presi?
dent Spencer and Six Others?En- !
jrineer Kinney and Brakeman King
Met Instant Death.
Danville, Va. (Special).?Follow?
ing close upon the disaster of Law?
yer, "?7 miles from here, on Thanks?
giving Day. which resulted in then
death of President Samuel Spencer,
of the Southern Railway, and six
others, another*wreck horror on the
Southern occurred In the railway
yards here early Saturday morning
Two persons met instant death, an?
other was fatally, wounded and three
others were injured.
The accident happened about ^ 4
o'clock, when northbound train No.
34. a mixed passenger and Pullman
train of about 10 coaches, crashed
into No. 82, a freight train of 30
cars, which was standing on the
main line. All of the passengers es?
caped injury of any consequence,
though all were shaken up.
The list of the dead comprises En?
gineer George CA Kinney, of Thomas
ville, N. C, and Brakeman W. B.
King, of Danville. Va. Robert Ford,
the negro fireman, sustained injuries
which will no doubt result in his
death.
The following is a list ol the ser?
iously injured, who were taken tc
the General Hospital here: O. P.
Mull, of Columbia, S. C. flagman;
11. M. Patterson, of Chatham. Va.,
brakeman; Robert For?L colored,
fireman, and O. O. Mailer, of Wash?
ington, postal clerk.
Botli of the trains were running,
behind time, and the freight train,
after passing the bloclt station, three
miles south of here, was, detained
in the yards on account of otherl
trains. The freight had been stanal
ing on the main line linearly an !
hour when No. 3 4 came.awuud the |
curve at a rate of al^^PliPlnilos an
hour. Tbe englnejHtwed through
the caboose of the freight, and like
a giant bull hurled it over its head.
Engineer Kinney stuck to bis pos!
and was instantly killed. Fifty yards
above tin? scene of the accident the
negro fireman, realizing what^was
going to happe?; jumped from the
locomotive and lauded- on the
ground, unconscious.
As Boon as the collision occurred
fire followed. Four cars were burn?
ed up and other damaged by the
flames. The fire department was
called out, and after several hours
had the flames under control.
Next to the engine on ?o. 3 4 was
the postal car, which was demolished,
and a number of clerks In it were,
injured. The injured darks left on a ,
northbound train, and their injuries
are not regarded as serKais.
All of the passengers In the Pull?
man and day coaches escaped.
The body of Engineer Kipney was
found pinned under the wrecked en?
gine. It wits not mangled/^Vindi
cations showed that he had beon
scalded to death by the steam es?
caping from the boiler.
The death of \V. B. King, who was
on the caboose of the wrecked
freight train, was frightful. King
was learning the business of rail?
road brakeman, and his body was
burned to a crisp. Only the body
from the legs to the neck was ex?
tricated from the wreckage, and this
was merely a pile of jSSbpS and co?
agulated blood. The^^HBbrms and
legs were missing, M^Ehe ashes
was placed in a mail bag and carried
to an undertaker's shop.
