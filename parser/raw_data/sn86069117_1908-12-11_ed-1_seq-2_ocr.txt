Talk about boys going on hunting trips,
but there never was a boy that had such sport
ahead of him as that before Kermit Roose
velt, who will accompany his strenuous father,
'President Roosevelt, on his famous year's
hunt in the wilds of Africa. Kermit has the
sporting blood, of his distinguished father
in his veins and he will play no empty
role in the big hunt. The boy is a crack shot
and has been practicing with heavy rifles and
pistols for several months to be in shooting
shape when he meets big game. Kermit is
also the official photographer of the African
trip and carries with him several thousands
dollars worth of camera supplies. There is
going to be something doing in darkest Africa
next year. ,

The Socialist party cast only about one
half the number of votes for their Presidential

pointed in the size of their respective votes,
and the latter showed up much weaker than
four years ago. The fact is that there is no
room for third parties in this country.
In 1SS0 the value of the Smith's agricult
ural products was $2,250,000,000, and this
year it promises to run very considerably ahead
of these figures. But in 1S80 the value of
the manufactured products of the South was
about $450,000,000, whereas now it is about
$2,500,000,000. This is nearly one half as
much as the total for the eutire country in
18S0, when the value of manufactured prod
ucts was $5,300,000,000. Temporarily halted
by the financial aud industrial depression of
the last seven or eight months, now fortunately
rapidly passing away, the manufacturing inter
ests of the South are in better shape for great
development and a more rapid growth than
ever before.

PROF. B0WDEN
Succeeds Mr. James B. Wood as
Prosident of tho Christian En
deavor Loanuo
At a meeting ol the Executive Com
mittee of the Union League of Chris
tian Endeavor Wednesday evening
Mr. James B. Wood resigned as Presi
dent and Prot. A. O. Bowden was
unanimously chosen to fill the va
cancy. Mr. Wood regretted very much
that ho could not continue as Presi
dent, but because of numerous other
duties ho did not feel that he could
give the work the proper attention.
The Union is exceedingly fortunate in
its selection ot Prot. Bowden as Presi
dent, as tbe work is sure to progress
under his leadership. The next pub
lic meeting of the Union will be a
watch-night service on the evening of
December 31st at the First M. E.
Ohurcb, South.
A program appropriate to the occa
sion is being arranged and will bo an
nounced in detail in a few days. Let
all the young folks plan to attend
this social.
ANOTHER DAMAGE SUIT
Nipped in the Bud By the Interfer
ence of a Humane Stranger
Dave Barnes, colored, of thecounty,
came to town yesterday and tanked
up with thirty cent booze nnd after
having reached a somnolent state me
andered out onto the 0. and 0. Railway
track in front of Cooper's warehouse
and laid himself down for a peaceful
sleep nnd happy dreams, taking the
North rail of the track for a pillow nnd
head rest.
A stranger happening along just
in time to knock Coroner Fred Dreeel
out of a $5 fee noted the appronch of
a Westbound freight and the imperiled
position of the unconscious Blccper at
one nnd tbe same time, and calling to
his aid Ben Lee, the colored porter at
Fnrwick's saloon, the two managed to
drag the drunken man out of harm's
wayju8t in timeto save him from be
ing cut in twain.
Had it not have been for the inter
vention of the unknown gentleman
there would have been another mark
on the bloody scroll of those who havo
gone before in a similar manner by
the C. nnd O. route in the vicinity of
Market street and the depot and no
fault of the railway company at that.
ANOTHER FEUD
Breaks Out at Jackson Callahans
and Smiths at War Again
Jackson, Ky., December 10th The
Jackson home ol Fred White was at
tacked last night by unknown parties,
who threw several etickB ol dynamite
acainst the building, partially wreck
ing it. White was aroused by the first
explosion and threw the baby out ol
the window. He followed it and car
ried it in his arms a mile in his night
clothes, being pursued by unknown
enemies.
Feud troubles are being revived. A
gang composed of five or six rode to
the home of Ed. Callahan, who was the
Chief Lieutenant of Judge James Har
gis during tho Breathitt assassination
troubles, and began firing into his
house. Callahan returned the fire from
within the house, badly wounding
Rand Sebastian and killing a mule
ridden byWilliam Beaton. Lewis Dea
con, his son, Logan, and William Eiloy
were arrested on a charge of attacking
Callahan and accused of conspiracy.
More arrests are expected.
A feud between the Callahans aud
Smiths is feared. There haB been
enmity between Callahan and tho
Healths since Callahan's trial for the
Breathitt murders. John Smith, one
of the Accused, confessed he was hired
to do murder, The latest trouble was
