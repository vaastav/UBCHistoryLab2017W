Congress.
The second and last session of the 4.'1<1
Congress commenced on Monday, and
the President’s Message, a synopsis of
which we publish in another column,
taken from the Baltimore Gazette, was
read in both Houses.
In the Senate the credentials of Messrs.
hdmunds and Eaton were presented.
Mr. Morrill reported from the special
Committee an entirely new scheme of
government for the District of Columbia,
embracing a system of Municipal Boards
the chief of whom shall be three Regents,
to be appointed by the President and con
firmed by the Senate. Mr. Sherman sub
mitted a bill for the revision of the Cus
toms laws. Amongother bills introduc
ed was one for the relief of the Western
sufferers by the ravages of the grassliop
pers, and another to break up the impor
tation of ( hinese into California under n
system of slavery.
In the House a number of the new
members who had l>eon elected to fill va- i

not refrain from letting Mr. Hutlcrknow
how good he felt over the elections by
reminding the latter that his (Cox's)
side of the House would soon be in the
majority. After this remark the House
adjourned, Mr. Phelps giving notice that
he will press his bill for the repeal of
the Poland law.

Secretary Robeson's Report.
Secretary Robeson's report , shows our
fittle navy to be in good condition, con
sidering the small amount of money that
is spent upon it and the age of many of
its ships. It now consists of 1(53 vessels
of all classes, but probably one-third of
these are practically worthless. We
have seventy-throe steam vessels nomi
nally fit for cruising, but there are but
fifty-eight of them that are of service,
and of these forty-one are now in com
mission. Twenty-one of our iron-clads
can do duty, and the rest are ready for
the junk shop. Mr. Robeson devotes a
considerable portion of his report to a
commendation of the great naval drill
off the Florida coast last winter as a
specimen exhibition of the discipline and
efficiency of the navy. The Secretary
nowhere favors extravagant expenditures
but he argues that there should be a re
gular addition to the navy each year to
replace worn-out and retired ships. An
interesting portion of the report is that
treating of the movement amongst the
people of Iceland to abandon their an
cient home and settle upon the North
IVific coast of the United States.
MARYLAND INDEPENDENT-December 9, is? I.
The President’s Message.
The Message of President Grant, as
transmitted to Congress, is in many re
spects a more forcible one than could
have been anticipated from those which
have hitherto emanated from our self-in
dulgent President. In the very begin
ning he touches sharply upon the exist-
I ing financial t distress of the country.—
I Business and industries are. as lie truly
F says, prostrated, while labor and capital
are plenty. He therefore thinks that
1 “wise statesmanship at this session of
Congress would dictate legislation ignor
ing the past, directing in proper chan
nels these great elements of prosperity.”
Most excellent advice, if only carried
out. The large public debt he considers
an element of depression, and the “sys
tem of currency”—paper—which it is
impossible to keep at par, has. lie thinks,
induced a most pernicious spirit of spec
ulation and extravagance among the peo
ple. Rather coolly, if not sarcastically.
He remarks that he does not question the
wisdom of the introduction of this cur
rency at the time of its adoption. He
urges, as a matter of justice and good
faith, that the Isinds held abroad should
lie paid in coin or its equivalent, or else
National disgrace is inevitable. To ob
tain means for this, commeree, manufac
tures and agriculture should be encour
aged. The first step to be taken is, he
says, “to secure a currency, good wher
ever civilization reigns,” and this, lie
thinks, consists nuly *>f gold and silver,
ttu which wo must return at the earliest
ipocii.i.- moment, and until that is done

ejiauge, and repeats: “It is the dutyof
Congress to devise the method of correct
ing the evils which are acknowledged to
exist, and not mine; but I will venture
to suggest two or three things which seem
to me as absolutely necessary to return
to specie payments, the first great requi
site in a return to prosperity. The legal
tender clause to the law authorizing tin
issue of currency by the National Gov
ernment should be repealed, to take ef
fect ns to all contracts entered into after
the day fixed in the repealing act, not to
apply, however, to the payment of sala
ries by the Government or for other ex
penditures now provided by law to be
paid iii currency in the interval pending
between repeal and final resumption.—
Provision should be made by which the
Secretary of the Treasury can obtain gold
as it may become necessary, from time
to time, from the date when specie re
demption commences. To this might
and should be added a revenue sufficient
ly in excess of expenses to insure an ae-
Treasury to

HSHvcffccted during this session.
He speaks favorably of our foreign
relations, which have been friendly dur
ing the post year with all other Powers,
lie hopes for a successful result of the
pending negotiations for further openiug
to our commerce of the Empires of China
and Japan. He renews his recommen
dation that a special Court be authorized
to hear all claims of aliens against the
United States for damages to person or
property “during the insurrection.” He
alludes to the progress of the survey to
determine the boundary between the
United States and British Possessions in
America, and states that the field work
has been completed.
He states that the “Court of Com
missioners of Claims” cannot possibly
complete the work before it prior to Feb
ruary, 1875, when it expires by law,
and asks an extension of the time of its
jurisdiction.
In relation to the Cuban struggle, lie
says that “six years of strife gives the
insurrection a significance which cannot
be denied,” and thinks that some positive
steps should be taken in the matter.—
The questions between this Government
and Spain are still unsettled, hut a speedy
adjustment is hoped for.
The President calls attention to the
frauds perpetrated upon the diplomatic
and consular officers of the United States
by means of false naturalization certifi
cates, and ask that legislation he shaped
to punish oftenders in such cases.
The President refers to the report of
the Secretary of the Treasury, and con
curs in its recommendations. He ad
vises that the tariff be readjusted, so as
to increase the revenue, while decreas
ing the uumber of articles upon which
duties are levied, aud again pointedly
calls attention to the unwisdom of recent
legislation. Iu commenting upon the
Army and Navy reports, the President
suggests various improvements iu those
branches of public service. He also re
views the report of the Postmaster Gen
eral and notes the suggestions for an
equitable adjustment of compensation to
j railroads for carrying the mail;.
In reference to the difficulties in the
State of Louisiana the President explains
and endeavors to justify his acts in re
cognizing and supporting the Kellogg
Government, and states that unless CW
gress shall take action in the matter he
will continue to do so. He also declares
that the presence of Cnited States troops
was necessary in many portions of the
Southern States to prevent and punish
the intimidation of Voters at the polls,
and denounces the White Leagues and
other societies of that class, lie says,
in reference to the Arkansas troubles,
that lie declined to interfere pending the
Congressional investigation of the mat
ter, and calmly expresses a general re
pugnance to Executive interference in
the affairs of the States. Of tie ques
tion of the difficulties between the races
he says :
‘■lait there be fairness in the discussion ol
Southern questions, the advocates of both or
all political parties giving honest, truthful re
ports of occurrences, condemning the wrong
and upholding the right, and soon nil will be
well. I ndcr existing conditions the negro
votes the Republican ticket tiecausc he knows
his friends ure of that party. Many a good
citizen votes the opposite, not because ire n
grees with the great principles of State which
separate the parties, hut because generally lie
is op|wrsed to negro rule. This is a most de
lusive erv. Treat the negro ns a citizen and a
voter as he is. and must remain, and soon par
lies n il! be divided, not over the color line
Imt upon principle. Then we shall have no
complaint of sectional interference.”
He refers briefly to the report* of the
.Secretary of the interior and Commis
sioner of Agriculture, and praises the
reforms in the Civil Service, llo great

its relation to capifa^^^B|H[^^i:ta\
be said that after explaining the origin
of currency—metal and paper—ho im
pressed his bearers with the importance
of recollecting that currency was merely
a tool of exchange. He next considered
the depreciation in value of American
currency, and strongly deprecated any
further inflation as only tending to aid
in enabling money to be secured for
speculative purposes, and thus diverting
it from regular channels of trade. He
advocated earnestly a resumption of
specie payment at some time to he abso
lutely established by Congress. lie
spoke of the present financial condition
of America as being such as to place her
far below the position she ought to oc
cupy in the estimation of the world.
jT-?T It is now proposed to colonize our
very unattractive possessions in Alaska
As they are too damp and cold for the
ardent American temperament, they are
kindly recommended to the hardy and
phlegmatic natives of Iceland. An Ice
landic commission has recently prospect
ed over portions of the territory, and is
reported to declare that, though the
country may be death to the ordinary
races of people, it is a nice land for an
Icelander. Very well; we are not only
satisfied, but happy. Let them come
over, one and all. We decidedly prefer
the Norse to the Chinese immigrants as
compatriots; and there would, besides,
be a charming romance in seeing the
same healthy but not overwise race, who
were cheerful and happy on the bleakest
traets of the eastern shore of the Con
tinent five hundred years befor the voy
age of Columbus, just as content in this
day to be settled upon equally undesirat
blc lands three thousand miles to the
west.
£-£"lt is understood that it is contem
plated by Justice Swayne to retire from
the bench of the Supreme Court in a few
months, under the law of Congress.—
Justice Swayne, if he retires, will have
his full salary during the remainder of
his life. This will give another appoint
ment on the Supreme Court Bench to
President Grant, who has already had
the appointment of four Supreme Court
Judges, and another during his term of
office would make a majority of the
Court his appointees. Such a thing has
never happened before during the in
cumbency of any President.

nected with the Granger movement in

Supreme Court of the U. S. for decision.
There are three easespending, which in

Uaitimork, Dee. 1, 1874.
"The rai-taurtiotT days are come,
The saddest of the years . .
A little too warm for brandy-smash,
A little too cool lor beer."
Thus lias a later-day poet befogged
the lines of thsA ~A" •••* nobler poet
„.l. . .. .memem inasmuch
us every TsalyTs supposed to know who
poetized the *'lnelanelmly days." Nor
do I wish it to be understood that I en
tirely sympathise with the later-day poet
aforesaid, for •■brandy-sinusli" l never
did taste of; yet l have realized the
coolings of beer and do grieve some
what that I have to forego my mid-day
glass.
However, there is no use writing of
“melancholy days' now. for they have
come and gone. Hud l written some
days ago, ns l would have done hut for
certain peculiar physical sensations class
ed under the general designation “not
well,” how I would have reveled in the
“melancholy days! l |,u know it is
quite the thing. Everybody does it.—
All the newspapers are affected with it.
The dailies have leaders on the subject.

about withered leaves and blasted hopes
and the awful significance of the fading
November. We would have spent a
whole day in “Druid Hill Park” and
“inixt
Our fancies wjtli thesallo\v*rifu*<l gloom*
tit pvpuiug, and tin* moaning* of the wind.”
And then we would have wandered
home, and, mounting numberless flights
of stairs, which might have jostled down
or jostled out the harmony of our
thoughts, wo tumid have lighted our
students lamp, we would have seated
ourself before an open wood fire, and,
gazing awhile into the light thereof, a
soft melancholy would have stolen over
us made harmonious by fitful gusts out
side ; and then —unless you be made of
stone —-we would hare penned some lines
that—well, “The Pleasures of Melan
choly” of •• Irving’s” “Poordevil author”
would'nt hove been a circumstance.—
And as the mater of t'.iis poor devil’s
poem is not given to the reader, so your
imagination may work up at leisure what
our effusion would have been, (rive
thanks, meanwhile, that you were spared
the agony.
Hut joking aside, one does feel as
though one should be in the country on
some of the days we have had. A gun,
a ride on horseback, a listless lolling
wherever fancy may select, solitary
musings, autumn-day reveries, not alto
gether meaningless as some reveries arc,
hut tinged with that melancholy which
does in fact make harmony. It is such
breaks in this work-day city life which
gives to life itself harmony. However,
enough of this. Wo don’t propose to get
sevious, nor aWw this fit of melancholy
to grow over us. It is too late in the
season as we have said. Every thing
and every laxly is braced up and prepar
ing for the winter campaign, so we will
go into the street and reflect on shops,
women or whatever we may pick up.
The shop windows look brilliant and
wcll-stuffcd and the shop men seem brisk
and lively, and this is about all that can
be said from a casual glance ; nor do I
see how any reflections can be made
hereupon. Hut about the shop girls
some men might grow eloquent, though
for my part I can’t see that shop girls
here are as much on good looks as in
some cities I have been in. One of the
sweetest looking beings I ever saw, was
a shop girl in Philadelphia. I went in
to purchase a piece of blue ribbon, and
you know how long it takes to find the
proper shades of blue. Hut about all
these shop girlg, flower girls or if is as
in the incident related by l)e Quincy in
his “Stage coaches in England.” You
never see them long enough at a time to
have the charms with which you clothe
them dispelled by seeing them eat or
anything of the sort. I wonder if
Holmes would have been so gushing
about that chambermaid if the matter of
the lost key luu| been discussed over the
last course at dinner instead of in a hotel
corridor. I wonder too if that relation
of mine who used to be such an admirer
of confectionery girls ever saw that little
four-and-a-half street girl eat. Hut to
return to the streets of Baltimore. The
streets are particularly the thing at those
periods of the day w hen the ladies are
out in full blast, 1 think Baltimore holds
its reputation for pretty women rather
from their outdoor than indoor appear
ance; though Heaven forbid that I should
insinuate they don’t look divine on every
occasion. I suppose the reason is the
ladies here appear on the street so well
and sometimes so elaborately dressed ;
another argument in explosion of the.
“beauty unadorned” theory, another
street feature is also in full glow at this
season. I tlude to the mendicants crouch
ed upon door steps or standing on pro
minent corner?, who with the approach
of cold snaps have an extra twang of
what is meant to la: piteousness in their
tones, though 1 must cotif ss this sort of
thing appeals to my sympathy very little
now-a-aays. For 1 note the same old
wrecks whom I observed winters ago in
apparently the same state of decrepitude,
and l have long since collie to the con
clusion that if they are as helpless as
they represent themselves, they should
have died long ago. There are two old
women to he found nearly every day on
Charles Ft., who are particularly dis
tasteful to me. < )ne lias a fearfully
bungled up foot and a carefully wrapped
hand which have to my knowledge been
in this state of careful concealment for
several years, leading one to think she
lias a tcn-pcnny-nail in her foot and a
darning needle in her hand. At first
she scctncd an object for charity, hut I
passed her one day as she was counting
her pennies and lialf-dimos, and there
was such a look of avarice on her face
as convinced me she must he a fraud. I
will lay a wager that woman has lots ol
money at home. The other old woman
may or may not be an imposter, but I
conceived a personal dislike to her.
which her new tactics have not dispelled.
Flic used to have a basket of those thin
rubber balls which make a most disgust
ing infantine squeak on being pressed ;
and invariably when 1 passed her on my
way to dinner she would rouse herself
from her depressed posture and squeak

a three months old baby if you happen
ed to have one. That woman was the
pest of toy life for a whole winter. 1
passed her with stealthy tread and bated
breath, but she seemed to feel nty
presence.
Hut in compensation for the persistency
of these old women, we are somewhat
relieved of hand-organs, those musical
nuisances or rather music murderers.—
< Iccasionally one comes across a good
hand-organ well ground. 1 have only
met with two hand-organs that I could
tolerate. You see lam dealing in cou
plets. One was manipulated by a tine
looking Italian with a brigandish look
ing hat and mustache who ground out
some choice airs from “// Noviitorr"
and other operss, accompanying his
music with an occasional graceful take
ofl' and wave of his hat byway of let
ting you know that any favors would Ik
thankfully received. This fellow was
an artist in his way. The other hand
organ was a diminutive box with a
plaintive wail, just suited to the only air
I ever heard from it. This was a part
of that closing “mt” in “Lucia”
“ Toiiilh; deijli mi mini ’ of course the
thing was vilely enough done by this
music box, but it always carried me back
to the opera as I first heard Nillson and
Caponl render it in the shadows of that

wandered around in the gloaming tilled
with the image of that beautiful white
robed maniac and the the lover’s mourn
ful melody still brooding over my soul.
I hav’nt heard that box for a long time,
and I suppose now I should laugh at
these fancies and be very much relieved
by kicking the cadaverous looking grin

A Dangerous Counterfeit.
Attention is called to a new and dan
gerous counterfeit, of which quite a large
number have appeared in circulation
within a few days. It is a close imita
tion of the issue of the five dollar hill of
the Traders’ National Hank of Chicago.
The entire hill is liable to deceive even
an expert at the first glance, and those
who receive bills of this bank would do
well to examine them with reference to
the following description of the differ
ence between the true and the counter
feit. I'nder the letter “C,” in the word
“Chicago” on the face of the counter
feit note, the last shade line runs into
the top of the first letter in the word
“pay,” which is directly under it, while
in the genuine a distinct space intervenes.
In the date of the year “1865,” under
the right-hand end of the words “five
dollars,” in the body of the note, the
numerals “6” and “5” come closely to
gether. In the counterfeit there is a
much wider space. The panels in the
border surrounding the face of the
genuine note have numerous marks of
the drapery. In the counterfeit the
marks are fewer and less distinct. On
the reverse of the note the most distinc
tive point of of difference between the
counterfeit and the genuine appears in
the lathe work enclosing the figure “5”
at the lower right and left-hand corner
of the note, the eccentric circles being
nearly round and very distinct in the
counterfeit, and much more eccentric
and less clear in the genuine. The
kneeling figures in the lefthand of the
vignette on the back of the note are
much less distinct than in the genuine,
and the work generally is coarser. The
paper upon which the note is printed is
inferior in quality to that used hy the
Government, being much coarser.

Accounts from Canada as well as

Canada between thirty and forty minis

each person voted for, from the official returns
of the Judges of Election certified to him : and
thereupon by Executive Proclamation to de
clare the result.
And Whereat. by the said returns so certi

for the several candidates as Representatives
from this State, to the Congress of the United

Now, therefore I, James Black Groove, Gov
