HeadllKhU on the Message
The United States has remained
studiously neutral.
T1i Wilson doctrine of Pan-Amer
lcanlsm contemplates the partner
ship of all the Americas, Instead of
a suardianshlp by the United State!
Tne administration's Mexican pol
icy a proof that the United States
seeks no political suzerainty or po
litical control.
A strong army and nary are
needed for national defense, to he
supported by the militia and a "cit
izenry trained to arms."
A great merchant marine Is need
ed for commercial independence on
tha seas, for national development,
national efficiency and aa a naval
auxiliary.
Reform in the government of
Porto Rico and the Philippines la
very desirable.
Additional revenue is needed to
meet demands for national defense.
Borrowing money Is not practi
cal. The country should pay as It
goes.
Hyphenated Americans have been
a disgrace to the nation.
New laws should be passed to
deal with' treasonable activities ot
foreign born citizens.
American Inventive genius haa
been mobilized to provide additional
means if or national defense. ,
National resources should be mo
bilized both for economic develop
ment and national defense.
The whole mass of transportation
legislation should be revised.
Washington, Dee. 8. Prepared
ness by the whole Western Hemis
phere, a moral partnership of 111
the Americas, a co-operation of
their national alms, national policies
and national economical that waa
the mammoth conception ot Presi
dent Wilson's annual address to
congress.
' It was primarily a preparedness -message.
Members of the senato
and house knew It would ask enor
mous sums for national defense. Bat
the president merged this glgantlo
project Into an Infinitely greater-
plea for Pan-Americanism. He gave
a new definition of the Monroe Doc
trine. It waa:
"The states of America are not
hostile rivals, but co-operating
friends, and their growing sense ot
community of Interest alike In mat-
ters political and In matters econo
mic, is likely to give them a new
significance aa factors In Interna- '
tlonal affairs and in the political
history of the world."
