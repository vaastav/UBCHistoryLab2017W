ocretary has the report under consid
ration.
Move for Inquiry.
A resolution providing for a thoro
avestigation of the situation and con
ltions at the naval academy was in
roduced today by Eepresentative Loud
Michigan. The investigation is to
made by the house naval committee,
vlrich is especially instructed to"ascer
aia and report whether violations of
he law and the regulations governing
he academy continue, and whether haz
ng, fagging, running and class fist
ghting continue in practice there, and
he knowledge of and responsibility of
he officers of the academy for anv
onditions found to exist."
The resolution empowers the commit
ce to act thru a subcommittee if
leemed advisable, which may sit at
-he capitol or at the naval academy.
Annapolis, Md., Dec. 14.A case of
azing of an extremely indiscreet and
ratal nature has been discovered at
he naval academy, notwithstanding
he sworn testimony of midshipmen
witnesses before the Meriwether court
.lartial recently that the practice did
ot exist at the academy. The affair
ook place Tuesday night, and the vic
im, Midshipman Jerome Kimbough,
a found in his room in" an uncon
cious condition, which had been m
uced by being compelled by upper
lassmen to repeatedly stand on his
ead. The affair was discovered by the
fficer in charge of the building and
..iimediately reported to the authorities.
Admiral Sands, superintendent of the
cademy, ordered the affair to be in
estigated by a board of officers. Their
eport was made to him and it was
ound that Midshipman Trenmor Cof-
n, Jr., of the third class, had been
practicallis caught in th act how
ver, and Vanderveer, who is from
-*Iount Holly, N. J., was on duty in
ach a position that he must have been
ware of the proceedings.

In connection with the condition of

TEMPTS DEATH IN
AIRSHIP RUNAWAY
Chicago Inventor Soars Above

hazing and
Chicago, Dec. 14.With the daring
of a man who faces death for the mere
excitement of it, Horace B. Wild, 32
years old, yesterday afternoon, for the
first time in his life made a flight in
an airship. He soared to a height of
2,500 feet above the ground.
After a series of thrilling experi
ences he returned to the earth safely,

Hundreds of people filled the streets to
see the navigator in his flight.
The trip thru the air at the dizzy
height of half a mile was made under
difficulties and Wild several times
thought it was his end.
In Peril from Cold.
His greatest peril was the danger of
losing his hold on the machine on ac
count of the cold. Twice his numb
fingers slipped from their grasp of the
frame of the ship and twice he caught
himself by hooking his heels into a
groove the crossbeams. This was at
the maximum height.
The start was made at 4:30 p.m. at
Sixty-seventh street and Stoney Island
avenue. The finish of the perilous jour
ney came thirty minutes later in the
gloom of the December evening.
For a time all went well, the diri
gible machine moving to the south
smoothly. Then came trouble. Wild
suddenly realized that the engine oper
ating the propeller had stopped because
the supply of gasolene was exhausted.
With that came to the airship man the
realization that he was going higher

Far above his head was the valve
of the great bag tied together with a
heavy rope. The navigator was un
able to untie the knot because of the
numbness in his hands and the danger
of falling, should he attempt it. Je
thought of the days when he was a
lad and bit knots with bis teeth. He
would try it this time. Then, holding
to the ship by the net above his head,
his feet swinging free aT)ove the frame
work, he bit away at the rope to let
the gas out. IA
It was dark by this time and the cold
was increasing. Several times in suc
cession ho tugged at the kn'ot and it
finally gave way. The gas rushed out
with such great force that it stunned
the young man and he fell upon the
frame exhausted, while the ship tumbled
toward the ground at a fearful rate.

The airship is a Chicago production.
It is seventy feet long from tip to tip,

Moody's order was received by the fed

J. M. Dickey of Minneapolis, first as

and said:
"At present our office is busily en

Moody's order is a new thing to us,
and naturally we desire to consider its
terms and the existing situation before
we proceed. It probably will be well

prosecutions under the terms of the

against the shxpper sfs -well as against
the railroad giving the rebate."
Mr. Dickey was asked if there would
be any investigation of the methods of
the express companies. He replied that
this could not be decided now, one
way or the other. In response to a
question as to whether there had not
already been some complaints brought
to the district attorney's attention of
violations of the Elkins law, he said he
did not care to state.

Sault Ste. Marie, Mich., Dec. 14.
Matte Penanen~has been found guilty of
killing Thomas Wilde on the railroad
track near Trout Lake on the night of
Aug. 12, in* violation of the law ot 1903,
making it a crime accidentally to kill a
person while in the woods hunting. The
prosecuting attorney, George B. Holden,
says this is the first conviction Under
the law. The maximum sentence is ten
years. Penanen will probably be sen
tenced ithis week. The jury recom
mend him to tho mercy of the court.
Penanen's defense was that he
thought Wilde was a bear. The latter
was returning from work alo'n'g the rail
road with a dog running at his side
when the shot was fired. He screamed
and dropped dead in his tracks. Pen
anen went to his cabin, bade his family
goodbye, disappeared in the woods,
caught a freight train and rode the
bumpers to Duluth. Later he went to
Port ArthuT where he shaved off his
mustache an"d secured work. He was
captured there. Penanen is the best

AMALGAMATED A T'
PAR MR. LAWSQN!
Copper Confounds the Boston
Man and Fulfills System's
Prophecies.
New York, Dec. 14.Amalgamated
Copper, in spite of the dire prophecies
of Thomas W. Lawson, crossed par yes
terday for the first time in four years.
Five years ago, in the great boom, it
sold up to 130. In 1903 it sold at 33%.
its lowest price. Yesterday it touched
100%, verifying, so^far, the prediction
made ten days agb by Standard Oil
men, that it would cross par before
'Christmas and sell at 110 before Jan.
1. Anaconda sold up to 196, Today
Amalgamated Copper hovered around'
par.
The scene around the Copper post was
one of the most exciting that has been
witnessed on the Stock exchange since
the great boom of 1900. Many wild
rumors were in circulation. It was said
that Thomas W. Lawson had been
caught heavily short and that the
Standard Oil interests, led by H. H.
Rogers, were punishing him for his per
sonal attacks upon them and upon the
property. Stock brokers who have in
the past executed orders for Mr. Law
son were heavy buyers of the stock,
but the rumor could not be traced to
any authentic source.
Mr Lawson repeatedly said over his
signature that Amalgamated Copper
was intrinsically worth only about $30
a share when the stock was selling at
$60 a share. He predicted break of
30 points. He also said that the cop
per metal would break 3 or 4 cents a
pound and cause one of the
most disastrous panics that the
market has ever known. At
that time copper metal was selling
at about 17 cents a pound. It has since
steadily advanced to the present record
breaking prices, while Amalgamated
Copper stock has advanced 40 points.

or demands to be made upon the opera
tors as a substitute for the strike com
mission'9 award, which will expire with
the month of March.
The miners' leaders plan thru the con
vention to request a conference of the
operators. This will be, made in the
form of a .resolution, and the follow
ing demands, it is said, will be made if
the conference is granted:
A party agreement, better known as
recognition of the union.
An eight-hour workday.
An increase in pay to all classes of
employees of at least 10 per cent, and,
possibly 20 per cent, based on the
wages in effect April 1, 1902.
This -would mean that the miners
would receive about the same as under
the present award. For some unskilled
employees it would mean a slight in
crease.
Should the operators be disposed to
grant the miners a conference, their in
tention will be known tomorrow to Mr.
Mitchell. In the event of a favorable
reply coming from the operators, tho
convention will be in a position to make
up its lists of demands and grievances
and to vote to the executive board, or
to Mr. Mitchell and the three district
presidents, the power not only to enter
into negotiations, but to make terms
for the miners for a short term.

JH AN FRIDAY WARMER TON!
i
Following
of oleomargari cases,thie
has been decided that any attempt by
congress to regulate the business of life
insurance necessarily must come thru
the taxing power of the national govern
ment and not thru the power granted to
eongress to regulate interstate com
merce.
As a result of this decision the recom
mendation in the president's message
looking into an inquiry into the power
of the government over the insurance
business has been referred to the com
mittee on ways and means.
To 'Ways and Means.''
Later on, if the multitude of bills on
this subject seem to be worthy of it,
they possibly may be referred to the
committee on judiciary to determine the
legal points involved.
In the meantime, all insurance legis
lation submitted to the house will be
referred to the committee on ways and

government has no power to reach the

Great care was taken in the house-

The trustees of ,the New York Life
have made the first hostile movement
against John A. McCall that they have
taken since the exposure of evils within
bidding him, or any other executive of*
ficer, to make payments of the Ajaay
Hamilton kind without the sanction of
the trustees. They also directed that
an investigation of all dealings between
Hamilton and the New York Life be
made and appropriate action be taken
when all the facts have been learned.
Today is the date fixed by John A.
McCall for the payment of all the
moneys owing to the New York Life
by Andy Hamilton. Until Hamilton
settles McCall is under a pledge to pay
the money out of his own private funds
before Dec. 31. It is not the purpose
of the housecleaning committee to force
McCall out before^ the end of the year
or before the Hamilton debts have been
settled. r
