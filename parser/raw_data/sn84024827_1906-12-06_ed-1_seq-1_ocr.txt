Famous Turfman and Owner
of Major Delmar, Is Found
Innocent of Having Used
Drugs to Win a Race.
NEW YORK. Dec. 3. The Memphis
gold cup dispute was officially ended
tonight when the board of review of
the National Trotting Association de
cided that the trophy had been won
on merit and dismissed the charges
against E. E. Smathers. The case.
which was taken up by the board at
the continuation of Its winter meeting
today, grew out of the drugging of Lou
Dillon at the Memphis meeting In Oc
tober, 1904.
Smathers, who owned Major Del
mar and drove him in the race, was
charged with having been cognizant
ot the. 111 treatment of C. K. G. Bill
ings' mare, Xou Dillon, which resulted
in the latters utter failure to show
form in the race and the winning of
the $5000 gold cup by Major Delmar.
George W. Speer was a most damag
ing witness against Smathers. He
had sworn that Smathers had request
ed him to open negotiations with
Saunders as to whether Lou Dillon
could not be "fixed." Speer said that'
Saunders offered to do the Job for
$10,000. but Smathers thought that too
much and told him to drop It. The de
fense Droduced witnesses who de
clared that Speers' character "was bad.
At the conclusion of the nearmg
John S. Wise, counsel for Smathers,
made a bitter arraignment of the men
who had nrocured charges against his
client, mentioning particularly C. K. O.
Billings, owner or Lou union, ana
Murray Howe, secretary of the Mem
phis Trotting Association. "I feel
that we have suffered long and pa
tiently and bitterly," said Mr. Wise.
"The charges are absolutely unsus
talned. And as to Billings and Howe
that Is a matter for further develop
ment which later we will take under
consideration." The case went to the
board in executive session, -which
lasted hardly quarter of an hour.

WASHINGTON, D. C, Dec. 5. A
brltf session of the Senate today re
sulted In the introduction of many
bills and resolutions, and tbe receipt
of a number of communications from
the executive departments.
Senator Foraker's insistence that
immediate action bo taken on the
pending resolution for information re
garding the discharge of the negro
soldiers of the Twenty-fifth Infantry,
developed a discussion, but resulted
in postponing action on the matter
until tomorrow.
WASHINGTON, Doc. 25. The
house today, while waiting on the re
port of the appropriation bills, began
Its legislative grind by passing three
measures, namely: The Incorporation
of the National German-American Al

the treasury to duplicate gold certifi
cates in lieu of oaea lost or destroyed:
and a bill amending the national bank
ing laws, permitting national banks to
make loan3 on leal estate as security,
and limiting the amount of such loans.
The banking bill has been orra of
the West's favorite measures, and tho
leaders in the house from that section
lined up generariy in favor pf the leg
islation which, It was asserted, would
go far toward popularizing national
banks.
The opponents of the bill. Democrats
and. Republicans, insisted that real es

DEFENDS HIS
IT-
Makes Full Explanation of Ac
tion Taken In Discharge of
Negro -Battalion From Ser
vice "Without Honor."
WASHINGTON, Doc. Zl Exjfact
from the annual report of Secretary
of War Taft, relating to tha Browns
ville, Tex., outrage by negro soldiers,
was made public today.
Secretary Taft recites the crimes of
the soldiers, as already described in
news dispatches; the failure of the
war department to obtain tho names
of the offenders and the discharge ot
the battalion. Secretary Taft Justi
fies the discharge, saying:
"It may be that In the battalion are
a number of men wholly innocent, wno
know neither who tho guilty men are,
nor any ot tbe circumstances which
would aid in their detection, though
this can not be true of many. Be
cause there may bo innocent men In
the battalion, must the government
continue to use it to guard communi
ties cf men, women and children
when it contains so dangerous an cli
ment impossible of detection? Cor
talnly not. The only means of rid
ding the military service of a band of
would-be murderers of women and
children, and the actual murderers ot
one man. Is the discharge ot the en
tire battalion.
"It Is a mistake to suppose that this
order is In itself a punishment either
of the guilty. Discharge would utter
ly be 'an inadequate punishment for
those who are guilty, whether of com
mitting murder on of withholding or
suppressing evidence which would
disclose the perpetrators of such a
crime. The use of the word penalty
In the proceedings Is a mero misnom
er and is unfortunate. Dismissal from
the service of the members of this
battalion, under the circumstances.
Is no punishment, however great the
hardships. There Is a dismissal, tech
nically known as a dishonorable dis
charge, which Is only imposed by sen
tence by a court. This Is punishment.
But members of this battalion were
not dishonorably discharged. They
could not have been so discharged ex
cept after trial. They were discharged
for the good or the service as the
technical phrase Is 'without honor.'
It Is not a fortunate phrase, because so
easily confused with dishonorable dis
charge. It Is called 'without honor
to distinguish a discharge from 'dis
charged with honor," or an honorable
discharge, which indicates termina
tion in due course, of satisfactory ser
vice An enlistment brought prema
turely to an end for the good ot the
service can not bo an honorable dis
charge. Hence, distinction must bo
made.
"Discharge 'without honor' is merely
the ending of a contract and separa
tion from the service under tho right
