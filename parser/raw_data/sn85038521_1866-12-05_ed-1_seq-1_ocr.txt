The Reform Demonstration With
drnivnl of the French Troops from
Mexico.
London, Dec 3. It is estimated that at.
least fifty thousand persons were in the pro
cession which formed so Imposing a feature
ot the iteiorm demonstration wnicu took
place to-day. Nearly all the trade socie
ties were out in full force, and inarched to
the place of meeting. Fifty-seven of these
organized bodies, together with various
members of the Reform League, were in
the line, which was composed of four grand
divisions, under the guidance of marshals
and led by bands of music, banners, society
Insitmia, etc. It was by far the largest and
most important affair of the kind which
lias ever taken place in tins country, not
witlistanding the very unpleasant state o
the weather. It is a fact worthy of notice
that the stars arid stripes waved above the
procession in many places, and was fre
rpiently and loudly cheered. The bands,
too, accrued to nave caueut the inspiration
of theiocoasion, and indulged in the pro-"
uucnon oi national airs ui a patriotic cuar-
acter.
The meeting took place in the grounds
of Ueauiort House, a most convenient loca
tion for a large gathering. Seven stands
were erected for theaccommodation of the
several speakers, a' large number of whom
were present on the occasion. The storc3
on Pall Mall, Piccodilly, and the other
thoroughfares through which the procession
passed were closed, and the trades people
thronged ttie streets all the way from St,
James tr&tK, wnere the procession was
formed, to the trrounds at Beaufort House.
The greatest order was maintained througli-
out the demonstration, and the most lively
enthusiasm prevailed. The moral effect
of the whole affair cannot be ov.er tsi
mated.

The Associated X'rcss Qnrrel.
New York, Dec, 3. The Associated
Press quarrel excites little interest here.
The policy of tho Association has not
changed. The World announced this
morning that it would take Craig's newsj
and it was then immediately dismissec
from the Association. The Herald, Times,
and Tribune, it is understood, had a con
ference to-day and agreed to interchange
special dispatches and send them over the
country. They also agreed to advance one
hundred thousand dollars each during the
next three ruontli3 towards" strengthing and
developing the facilitiesof the Association,
At this conference it was felt that the con
test is not with the country press, but to
prevent the creation of a one man tyranny
over news like that exercised by Mr. Beu-1
ter, of Europe. The most liberal arrang-
ment8 are being made with all papers that'
remain true to the Associated Tress.
Delegations from the est are here pro
testing against the action of Messrs. Hal-,
stead & White. The action of the Herald.
Tribune, ahd Times, of course, ends the
contest, and it is now said that Mr. Uraisr
will continue to send only commercial dis-
patchs and ship news, abandoning the vol-

Mr. Sumner gave notice that on to-mor
row he should introduce resolutions declar
ing the true pnnciple,of reconstruction, the
jurisdiction of Congress over the whole
subject, the illegality of the existinz Gbv
ernment and the rebel States, and the ex
elusion of such States with such illegal
governments from a, representation in flie

Mr. Chandler called up his resolution
offered yesterday, calling for certain infor
mationabont Mexican affairs.
Mr. Sumner hoped the resolution would
be referred to the Committee on Foreien
Affairs. Se had doubts a3 to the propriety
of the resolution, and that at any rate.it
should be referred.
Mr. Chandler stated that it was tncrcjy a
resolution of inquiry, and as such there
ought to be no objection to it.
Mr. Spalding hoped the resolution wouid
not be adopted. It contained language our
Government onght. not to use toward an
other. It asked if the French Emperor had
given any apology.
A motion to take up the resolution did
not prevail. '
Mr. Chandler called up the bill passed
by the House yesterday to repeal the 13th
lection of the confiscation act, which gives
the i'resident.power to grant a general am
nesty to those lately engaged in rebellion
Mr. Sherman called for the reading of
the section proposed to be repealed, and it
was read.
Mr. Johnson did not know whether, if
the section reterred. to were repealed, the
x'resiuent wouia not sun nave power to
pardon every man who stood ui a situation
to be pardoned. Over that power Congress
had nb control. At any rate he thought
the subject ought to be referred to some
committee.
Mr. Fesscnden would express no opinion
on the merits of the bill, but was opposed
to the passage of any measure until it had
been considered in committee.
Mr. Howard said there were grave doubts
as to whether, by the constitution, tiie par
doning power rested in tho President.
Mr. Chandler said hundreds of millions
of confiscated property had been returned
by the President and it was alleeed that
pardons were for sale around this town by
women of at least doubtful reputation, and
millions of property had been restored
through this channel. If the President
had power to do this thing under the con
stitution in God's name let him exercise it,
but in uod s name let no power be given
him that is not in the constitution.
Mr. Trumbull said he should probably
vote for the bill, but he teaw no pressinj
need Jor it; ana that there was great force
in vhat had been said by o'thers, in favor
of a reference to a committee.
The yeas and nays were demanded, with

Mr. Randall, of Pennsylvania, objected

lution: Besolved, In response to that portion of
the President's message that relates to those
communities which claimed to be the Con
federate States .of America, that the House
finds in the many acts of disloyalty which
have transpired in these communities since
its last adjournment, as well as in the recent
