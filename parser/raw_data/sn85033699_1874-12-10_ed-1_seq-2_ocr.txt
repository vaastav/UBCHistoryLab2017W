Ben Butler is reported to be on a
scalp hunt lie is said to be closely
watching Metsrs. Foster, Garfield,
Blaine and Phelps, and is reported as
declaring ttat Le will have their scalps
before the session is over.
The Gallatin Examiner in its last
issue, epeats of CoL R. A. Cox as hav
ing withdrawn from the Congressional
race in the Fourth District. There
must be some mistake about this, as we
have private advices to the effect that
he is still on the track.
Grant's ominous allusion to the
possible need for intervention in Cuba,
leads the Cincinnati Gazette to suggest
that insurrection prevails also in Spair,
and we might savo both time and
trouble by settling the affairs of Spain
herself, when Cuba would, doubtless,
follow suit.
The rum loaned by the French
Rothschilds to the Spanish Republic
Booms very large when stated as being
30,000,000 reals. On learning that a
Spanish real, of the purest coinage, is
worth only twelve and a half cents,
the figures shrink to 3,750,000 in dol
lars. But Spanish coinage is some
times so base that a "real" is really
worth only five cents.
Aftee the almostJunaninou8 pass
age by the House last Tuesday, of a
Lili forbidding Congressmen to act as
attorneys for revenue officers and each,
Ben Butler doubtless rejoices that his
term expires so soon- His profits in
the Sanbcrn contracts, the moiety sys
tem and half a hundred other rascal
ities, were pretty much all raked in
under the plea of attorney's fees.
After the passage of Tuesday's bill,
Butler will not want to be a Congress
man any more. If national legislators
are to be thus hampered, he can do
1 etter skirmishing on the outside.

One of the immediately risible effects
of thi year's elections in the South is an
alarming migration of the nesrro est

Nonsense ! They did the same thing
last year, when there was no election.
Agents are in the South this year as
they were last, offering the -negroes
"big wages" to go. to Arkansas or Texas
and work in the cotton Colds there.
That
is
the temptation; there is no
scare about it.
There is point in hat the Cincin-
nati Enquirer says about bayonet rule.
Four thousand United States troops
are employed in the Southern States,
says that journal, to carry elections by
their presence, to intimidate white
liK-n, to maintain a bayonet govern-
uientr to i .rofcof, carpet-bag thieves,
an-1, finally, tt establish a reign of ter
ror." It will be the duty of the next
Congress to stipulate, when it appro
priates money for the army, that the
soldiers eh;i!l bo placed where they can
prevent Indianr from murdering the
v. Lites i the West, instead of being
ia thi S'.ath,: where their only business
is to assist in robbery and pillage.

Grant, in bis message to Congress,
takes a very singular view of hia duty
touching the enforcement act. lie
pretends to imagine that if a negro is
coerced by his employer, or intimidated
by a mob into voting any ticket, or
prevented from voting, he must employ
the military power in the premises. But
tbe same thing may be done to white
voters ly the Republican manufactu
rers in the North, and Grant does not
care a "Continental." The Cincinnati
Eii'i'ilrer says:
"Tiie United States has no more
r;i;ht t' send soldiers to take charge cf

T11E UUAU LAW.
Several of our State exchanges are
discussing the backward and almost
impassible condition of country roads.
The complaint seems louder in East
Tennessee than any other section. The
road law passed by the last Legislata
is generally spoken of as a good one,
if it were carried into effect,- but its
execution was left optional with each
County Court, and it is stated that
few, if any, have given ir. the benefit of
a trial. Hence, there is a disposition
to urge that the la be made compul
sory on the counties by further legisla
tion. Among the rights dearest to the
free American's heart, is the right to
be shiftless and thriftless. We do not
quite clearly see how this right can be
curtailed without imparting a savor of
despotism to State rule. If some
counties want bad roads to drive men
and money from their borders, have
they not an inherent and inalienable
right to such roads? One of the prob
lems puzzling our "statesmen, is how to
prevent the emigration of Tenneaseans
to the "West. We cannot think of any
better plan for keeping these nomads
among us than that of allowing
them the free indulgence of their
primitive and pioneer notions about
bridle paths and bear trails being
superior to macademized roads. These
fellows are fleeing from our super-civilization.
If we really wish to restrain
them, we must restrain ourselves in our
mad cravings for an Appian "Way to
every vDlage and hamlet in the State.
REPORT OF .THE '03KPTB.OI.LEB
OF THE tXRBEXCT.
The report of John Jay Knox,
Comptroller of the Currency, submit
ted to Congress with the President's
message, develops some curious facts
bearing on the financial problem. Un
der operation of the act of June 20,
1S74, over twenty million dollars of
legal-tender notes were released from
the reserves of the banks. By that act
the amount of the legal-tender notes
was fixed at 382,000,000, and the re
lease of this reserve practically added chised elave." Queer, is it not? Pass
more than twenty million to the circu- ing queer, if the President believes half
lating medium. It had been locked up his own Ions ritrmarole about "South-
in the bank vaults prior to the law of
June 20. If there was a pressing de -
mandformoremoneyonewouldnatural -
ly expect to find this released reserve ab -
sorbed into the general circulation. But
this has not happened. On the contrary,
the banks have held a much larger sum

For the first time in the history of
uus country tue name oi a poiuieai
party bas been introduced into the
il - . '
message of a President of the United
States. Gen. Grant has the bad taste

A very readable paragraph might be
written upon the President's message,
noting some of the things it doe3 not
contain." For instance, we miss the
scheme for a grand Riparian Canal
along the Atlantic and Gulf coasts,
from the St. Croix to the Rio Grande,
to protect our timid shipping from the
the inclemencies of the open sea, and
to cost two or three hundred millions.
Grant's failure to renew this ' recom
mendation of his, is the more remark
able in view of his anxiety to give re
munerative Employment to idle labor.
From a Ctesarian standpoint, this
would seem the very nick of time in
which to push through such a gigantic
"improvement," when, as Grant as
sures us, labor is "very cheap." Thus,
the Government could "economize" at
the Bame time that it furnished work
for the idle millions.
Equally remarkable is tho omission
of any reference to the project of dig
ging an immense ditch or irrigating
canal from the Rocky Mountains to
the Missouri, for which the President
pleaded so persuasively one short year
ago. The need for the ditch remains
precisely the same now as then, while
it might possibly be utilized as a chan
nel of cheap transportation in rivalry
of the Pacific Railroad, and would
afford winter work and rations for the
starving farmers of Kansas and Ne
braska, who have been eaten out by
the grasshoppers.
Santo Domingo, of which we had a
bare bubble in the last message, finally
and forever disappears from the pres
ent one, leaving no trace of the tena
cious lodgment it once held in the Ex
ecutive cranium. Sic transit.
Again: One year ago President
Grant closed his message to Congress
in these words:
I suggest for your consideration the
enactment of a law, to better secure
the civil rights which freedom should
secure, but has not effectually secured
to the enfranchised slave.
Now he has not a solitary word in
favor of Civil Rights for the "enfran-
I era outrages." There is something of
1 an inconsistency here. But we give it
1 up, hoping that Grant now laughs as
1 heartily as any of us at these aban -
J doned follies rip-roaring and desert
I canals, negro annexation, Civil Rights

WHAT IS MALA III AT
The construction of the Panama
Railroad cost eighty-one thousand hu
man lives a death-rate equal to one
man per yard of the track. Certainly
the agencies which prove thus destruc
tive to human life deserve more atten
tion from the press and the public than
they receive. "What is malaria? A few
years ago no one suspected that ty
phoid fever was the-product of organic
life, which was able to propogate itself in
milk and in many other rich animal
and vegetable substances; yet this is
now known to be a well established
fact.
Malaria from the Pontine marshes of
Rome has been killing mankind for
unknown centuries without any one
"ever finding out how it was done. This
special ignorance has been at last, in a
good degree, removed, and the abate
ment of the evil will be next in order.
There is great reason for believing
that parasites too small to be seen by
the best'microscopes abound in naturo
Dissolve a grain of pure salt in a gal
lon of pure water, and when the parti
cles of salt are equally diffused, take a
drop, and with the best magnifying
glassor glasses ever made, see, if you can,
a molecule of the dissolved salt. By
other tests and experiments it is known'
that vision hardly approaches the dif
fused particles of salt in the drop of
water. But if matter really exists in
masses so inconcievably small, who
dare limit the minuteness of molecules
of protoplasm and monads? It is known
that the egg of the parent of the silk
worm often contains the germs of the
parasite which kills the worm, and pre
vents its forming any 6ilk. The mala
dy is strictly heriditary; but it is life
within, life, descending in the egg from
one generation to another.
All malaria are organisms, some of
which are killed by frost like those
which produce yellow fever. Frost
kills growing corn and cotton, but not
the vitality in their ripe seeds. In the
same way frost and medicine may kill
growing parasites, vegetable or animal,
but not their germs. The extermina
tion of these appears to demand more
advanced science. Civilization begets
many sharp necessities, and among
thera an ever-expanding wisdom is,
I perhaps, the most conspicuous. Tribes
1 and peoples who refuse to study and
J learn become extirminated. Pressed
I by these stern necessities, many have
cursed God and died. Still the laws
1 of nature are inexorable; industry and
learning revive; and true science makes
society wiser and happier.
Fifty years ago chemistry taught the
world, and especially the medical stu
dent, the names and origin of the nie-
phitic gases which produced, as was
then believed, all
malarial diseases.
t.i a.
But frost never destroys poisonous
gases, nor volatized minerals and
metals, like those of mercury and ar
senic. Jlalaria is not a gas, nor a va
por, nor a sublimated metal, but .a
living organism. Some, varieties of
these parasites kill hogs under the
name of cholera, cattle under the name
