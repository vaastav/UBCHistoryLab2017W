Conservation, Ship Subsidy and For

ing Tople3 Discussed Has
Little to Say About Tariff.
Washington, Dec. 6. Kconomy in
government affairs is tho keynote of
President Taft's annual message read
before both houses or congress today.
The message approximates 40,000
words and is one or the longest ever
submitted by a president.
Conservation of the public domain,
ship subsidy, rortificatlon of the rana
ma canal and the continuation of tho
present tariff board are the leading
subjects touched upon. He also re
views the work of tho various pov
eminent departments and concurs In
recommendation, tending toward the
bettering of the service, made by sev
eral of the members of his cabinet.
Economy Is Urged.

limy nndemtiind that these estimates thus
Hindi' present the smallest sum which will
mnint.iiii l'ie departments, bureaus and
olllci m of the government and meet Its
other obligations under existing law. and
that a rut of these estimates would re
sult In embarrassing tho executive hnineh
of tin- government In the performance of
Its ilutli'H. This remark does not apply
to the rlvir and havbor estimates, except
to these for expensed of maintenance and
the meeting of obligations under author
ized contracts, nor does It apply to the
public building bill nor to the navy build
ing program. Of course, as to these eon
gnss cntild withhold any part or all of
the estimates for them without Interfer
ing with the discharge of the oidlnary ob
ligations of thes.' functions of Its depart

"Against the e.stlmntis of expenditures

which will ultimately bo paid In bonis.
It will leave n deficit for the next .'itr of
about $7.rt.0fln, if enngnss shall nuii Indi

Wants Forest Limitation Removed.
On the subject of consi rvatlon he de
votes i onslderable space to forest, iua'
oil and gas, phosphate lands and water
power sites. As to the reservation of
forest lands lie s.ivs- "The law now pro
hibits the reservation of nny more forest
lands In Oregon. Washington, Idaho,
Montana, Colorado and Wyoming, except
by act of congiiss. I am Informed by the
department of agriculture that the gov

In these states which should be Included
In tho forest reserves. I iccomineiid to

says:
"Among ipieoilons nrlslnc for present

Ship Subsidy.
The president urges such nctlon as he
believes will Increase American trade
abroad, nnd says
"Another Instrumentality Indispensable
to the unhampered and natural develop
ment of American commerce Is merchant
marine. All mailllme nnd commercial na
tions recognize the Importance of this
factor. The greatest commercial nations

merchant murine Perhaps nowhere Is

"I alluded to this most Important sub

capitulate the reasons for Its recommen
dation. Unless prompt nctlon tie taken
the completion of the Panama canal will
find this the only great commercial na
tion unable to nvnM In International mari
time business of this great contribution to
tho means of the world's commercial In
tercourse." Criticism of the Tariff.
Tn tho space ikuitcd to tho tariff tho
president says:
"Tho schedules of the rates of duty In
the I'ayno tariff nt t have been subjected
to a great -ileal of criticism, some of It
Just, moro of It unfounded, and too much
misrepresentation. The net was adopted
In pursuance of a declaration by the par
ty which Is responsible for It that cus
toms bill should b" a tnrlff for tho pro.
tectlon of home industries, the measure
of tho protection to be tho difference be
tween the cost of produolng the Imported
nrtlcln abroad and the cost of producing
It nt home, togethrr with such addition to
that dlffeienco n might give a reasonable
profit to the home producer. The basis
for the criticism of this tariff Is that In
respect to a number of the schedules the
declared measure was not followed, but a
higher difference n tallied or InsertTd by
way of undue ill--- rlmlnatlon In favor of
certain Industries .mil manufactures. Lit
tle, If nny. of t e criticism of the tariff
has been direct, d against the prntc-'ctlvo
principle above stated; but the main body
of the criticism I. as been based on tho at
tempt to confoi , i to the measure of pro
tection was not honestly nnd sincerely
adhered to."
The president ilso refers to the appoint
ment of a board of experts to Investigate
the cost of prod ictlon of various articles
Included In the schedules of the tariff,
and concludes:
"Whether or t ot the protective policy Is
to be continued, and the degree of protec
tion to bo nccopled to our home Indus
tries, are questions which the people must
decide through their chosen representa.
lives. Hut whatever policy Is adopted, It
Is clenr that the necessary legislation
should be based on nn Impartial, thot
otigh and continuous studv of the facts."
Recommends Parcels Post.
The adoption e.f the parcels post Is
again adopted. On this subject President
Taft says: "With respect to the parcels
post, I respectfully recommend Its adop
tion on nil ratal delivery routes, and that
11 pounds the International limit hu
made the limit of carriage In such post.
The same nrgmm nt Is made against the
parcels post that wns made agnlnst the
postal savings bank Hint It Is Introduc
ing the government Into u business which
should lie conducted by private persons
and Is paternalism. The postolllco depart
ment has a gr'.it plant and n great or
ganization, re.-e blng Into the most remote
hamlet of tin- t'nlted Stntes. and with
this machlncr It Is nble to do a great
many things i onomlcally that If a new
organization wie necessary It would be
Impossible to do without extravagant ex
penditu res."
Department of Justice.
Discussing t! affairs of the department
of Justice, tli. president says:
"I Invite psp. i la I attention to the prose
cutions unde, the federal law of the so.
oal'nl 'bink.t shops.' and of thope
si In mes to d' fraud in which the use of
the mall Is .in essentlnl part of the

inum delation In that behalf."

slmpbfNing Judicial procedure and ex
pediting final Judgment Is pointed out nnd

The pit sldent recommends an Increase

Postal Affairs.
In regard to postal matters the presi
dent points with pililo to Its piesent e(TI
cli nt management and the recent reduc
tion In the deficit. The present unre
stricted franking pilvllege comes In for
iiimuent with n suggestion for the adop
tion of better methods for Its regulation.
Abolish Navy Yards.
The president calls attention to certain
reforms urged by the sccietary of the
navy which ho recommends f,,r ndoptlon,
and continues:
"The secretary of the navy has given
personal examination to every navy yard,
and has studied tho uses of the navy
yards with refercnco to the necessities
of our licet. With a tleet considerably
less than half the slzo of that of the
llritlsh navy, 'we have shipyards more
than double the number, and there nre
several of these shipyards expensively
equipped with modern mchlnery, which,
after Investigation the secretary of the
navv believes to be entliely useless for
nawil purposes, lie asks authority to
abandon cortrdn of them nnd to move
their machinery to other places, whero It
can be mnde of use."
Speaking of our foreign relations the
president says: "During the past year
the foreign relations of the t'nlted Stntes
have i ontlnued upon a basis of friendship
and good understanding.
"The year has been notable as witness
ing the paiillc settlement of two Impor
tant International contioversles before tho
pcimanent court of The Hague.
"The arbitration of the fisheries dispute
between the United States and Orent
Itiitaln. which has been the sourco of
nearly continuous diplomatic correspond
ence since the fisheries convention of lSR
has given nn award which Is satisfactory
to both parties. This arbitration Is par
ticularly noteworthy not only because of
the eminently Just results secured, but
also because It Is the tlrst atbltratlou held
under the general arbitration trenty of
April ). IMS, between the United Stntes
and Circat lirltnln, and disposes of a con
troversy tho settlement of which has re
slsted every other resource of diplomacy
and which for nearly ninety years has
been the cause of friction between two
countries whose common Interest lies tn
maintaining the most friendly and cordial
relations with each other.
President Taft makes a few- recommen
dations for changes In the Interstate com
merce law and says;
"Except as obove, I do not recommend
nny nmendment to tho Interstate com
merce law ns It stands. I do not now
recommend any nmendment to the anti
trust law. In other words. It seems to
me that the existing legislation with
reference to the regulation of corpora
tions nnd the restraint of their business
has reached n point where we can stop
for n while and witness tho effect of tho
vigorous execution of the laws of tho
statute books In restraining the abuses
. w hich certninty inu exist and which
I roused tho public to demand rsform."

Significance In Names.
Tn an Illinois town a worklngmnn
having been informed thaV n ulxth
baby had nrrlved at his home, ex
claimed: "Sufficient," and his neigh
bors, referring to his having given
that name Sufllclcnt to tho now
nrtivnl, credited him with originality.
Tho incident resembles u case nearer
home, adds tho Now York Tribune.
A Now York fntnlly was blessed with
nluo daughters, when the stork
brought a tenth one. It was in the
days when the slang term for an oft
told story was rt "chestnut," and as
the baby cortnlnly camo under that
head sho received tho name, but for
euphony's sake tho French for tho
word was employed, and she was call
ed Marron.
Time 1o Think Over Suicide.
Ho took parls green to commit sui
cide. Too big a dose to kill him. Emi
nent specialist happened to be called
in, and started to tlx him up. "No
use," said parls greon performer, "I'll
do it anyhow after you have done with
mo." Doctor got mad. "If that's the
way you feel about It, you fool," ho
said, "I'll not waste my tlmo on you."
Pari3 gioen iorfornicr much aston
ished and grioved. "Well," ho said,
"give me 21 hours to think it over."
Doctor gave him 21 hours and went
away. At tho end of tho time pads
green performer telephoned, "I've
thought It over and want to get well;
come and seo mo some more"
Triumph of Optimism.
"How are you feeling today, undo?"
asked tho robust nephew of his aged
and feeble kinsman.
"Pretty well, pretty well!" quavered
that lncurablo optimist, "my rheumn
tlz is bothering mo a good deal and
my erislpills is worso than It was yes
terday, I've got a slight hoadacho and
I wont down to tho dentist today and
had all but two of my teeth pulled,
but thank heaven thoso two arc op
posite each other!"
Saw Only Physical Idea.
Ono of his friends onco aslcod Mr.
Darwin's gardoncr about his master's
health, and how bo had been lately.
"Oh!" ho said, "my poor master has
been very sadly. 1 often wish ho
had something to do. He moons about
in tho garden, and I hiivo seen him
stand doing nothing beforo a flower
for ten minutes at a time. If he only
had something to do 1 really believe
ho would bo better."
As Time Passco.
"Hoforo you wcro married you used
to send your wife flowers."
"Yes," replied Mr. MeelUon. "Now
it takes a diamond necklace to nmko

RED CROSS SEAL IN HICT0RY
First Used During the American Civil
War Now an Aid In Fight
ing Tuberculosis.
Red Cross Christmas seals date
back in their origin to "charity
stntnfos," first used for the soldiers'
relief funds in Boston in 1862, during
tho Civil war. After tho war, thin
method of raising money wna discon
tinued in this country for a genera
tion, although it found vogue In Por
tugal, Switzerland, Australia, France,
Spain, Denmark, Norway, Russia,
Sweden and other European coun
tries. Thero are now sevoral hun
dred different types of charity stamps j
used In all parts of tho world. 1
Stamps or seals wcro first used to '
fill mnnno fnH .l.n nnll.ll.l.nmitlnnlH t
uiumuu in .Norway aim owuuun in
1904. After being used In these coun
tries for three years, ns a direct re
sult of tho' interest of Jacob Rlis In
this movement, tho Delaware Antl
Tuberculosis association, headed by
Miss Emily P. Ulssell, and the Red
Cross society of Delaware combined
In issuing a tuberculosis stamp. So
successful was this campaign that
nearly $3,000 was realized, and tho
next year, In 1908, tho American Red
Cross waB Induced to Issue a national
Red Cross tuberculosis stamp. From
this sale, $135,000 was realized, that
amount being almost doubled In 1909.
This year, for the first time, tho sale
is organized on a comprehensive
basis, taking In all parts of the
United States. A million for tuber
