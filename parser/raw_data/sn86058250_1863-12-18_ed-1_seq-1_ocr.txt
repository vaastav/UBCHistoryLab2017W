Beecticr en th Object of the War!
' Henry Ward Beech er, in a late speech at
tbe Academy of Music, New York, said of
the object of the war:
"It was also constantly alleged that the
North did out go to war for Emancipation,
but simply for Union. ' To that I responded,
Brae, true. Tbe peculiar construction of our
aattoa forbids one Slate to meddle, and the
National Government to meddle with the
tricily internal municipal affairs of any oth
er State. And I, who. have beearankel,
if not among abolitionists, yet saong anti-
slavery men, ail my lile, lieu myseit to be
competent witness to those me a who have
fought the anti slavery battle for twenty-five
years; and I bore witness that it never was
oar intention to interfere by violence in the
internal aflairs of Slave States. Oar hope
of Emancipation was based upon tbe per
petual use of moral influences, the actios of
preat commercial laws, the nature of polit
ical economy, and above all, the noo-exten-ion
of slavery. We held that if tho Slave
State might cease to be made, if they that
were already created were compelled to
stand and bear tbe evil as well as the good
of their own system, it would be a question
only ol time when they would emancipate,
but we never proposed to pat tbe hand of
government into those States and violate
those institutions, and we did not when the
war broke out; and therefore, when it was
alleged, that we did not go to war for the
purpose of emancipation, I snid amen; we
did not. We went to war for the maintain
ance of nationality. (Applause.) But then
it. was a nationality which had been re
generated and brought back to its original
nt lihorl. It wm a. TTninn that Mr-
tied with it from this time forth the idea of
freedom: and we had no doubt that Uuion
was to be the indirect instrument of Einen-
oipation. (Applause.) And when we)
went for tbe Union and for the nation, it

(Loud and enthusiastic applause.)
He then spoke of his efforts to develop j
American ideas ia England, and to eorreet
fake impressions. Weq note a few passages
from this part of his speech:
THI VTOLIMT VATCBB OF 8LATXRT.
MI found a very general impressi n in
England, assiduously cultivated on the part
of some, and ignorantly received by others,
that this was a nation peculiarly, from the
vary nature of its institutions and the char
acter of its people, to mobs. We are sup
posed to be vain, boast'ul, lawless, arrogant,
mascrupnlous; and one reason has been that
the band of this nation has been southern
for the last fifty years. (Applause.) 1
was obliged to say that it was not the North
that wanted Cuba; it was not tho North that
organized fiilHbustering expeditions to Cen
tral America; it was not the North that
quarrelled with Mexico; it was not the
North that has lei any of the conquers for
the last nfty years; tor tbe Aorta is esen
tially peaceful, able to make war, but loving
peace; and it is the nature of slavery to
maintain violence, because it is sallied on
bru'.e violence, and rejects moral principle
to start with, ana is obhirea in ail the moods
and tenses to rely noon physical force for
the maintenance ol that unjust and unebns
tian sys'en. :
Thus the aspect of America has been un
favorable in Europe, has arisen not from the
characteristic ideas of free society bat from
the characteristic mtnners of society. (Ap
pUuae.) Even suoh a one as Harry Brough
am was pleased in my presence for among
the trials that Providence put me to was thai
of listening to his address (laughter) to
atylo the American people the American
snob." I had never expected to thiuk eo

would be my duty to say to cenUemen in

HXPCBUCAM ISSTITCTIOWS ABLE TO SUPPRESS
RIOTS.
"It wu mr business, therefore, to show
that the fact were not as they believed them
to be. and I stated that there were (ewer ri
ots for the population, aod for the year of
this country, than ia aoy other civilized
country on the gl be; that republican insti
tutions, instead of being unaide to suppress
riots, when tbey did take place, were doub
ly able. First, they prevent riot, f t they
take away all motive for them; for why
should the men that have thr making of the
laws ri up agtiosl the laws ot tV.e r own
creation? When t e citizen have tho ab
solute power to send a man up, or take him
down, to enact or to annul, t lay fo nidations
or to subvert foundations, why should they
go riotiug? What motive is there? .No
people in the w.jrld are more conservative
than a people who are made universally
stockholders in the government. In Amer
ica there are two things. First, to a greater
extent than in any other country on the
globe, every man, clear down to the bottom
of society, is a house bolder or a landholder. .
and almost without exception, men are en
dowed with the elective franchise. They
have made the citizen a voter and a proper
ty owoer, and thus they have made it almost
impossible but that he should be a good cit
izen. He has an interest in supporting the
laws. He has an interest in the community.
His own bouse and family, his wife and
children, are so many pledges for his good
conduct. And we have no popular riots,
and, except in extreme cases, such as cases
of infection or mania, they are almost im
possible. And when they take place they
are more easily repressed, and society is
less strained here in the joints, than in any
other oountry in the world. And when
tbey exUt among us, and I told them so,
they are for the most part foreign." (Ap
plause.)
TUB RIOTS IN NBW YORK.
"I told them that tbe riots in New York,
of which so much was made, were just as
thoroughly foreign as if they bad taken
plaoe in Cork or Dublin. If they are not
foreign, then tbey are tbe fruit of that great
system of fraud and wrong, American sla
very. Aside from these two things, an ig
norant foreign population and the fomenting
of ideas are derived from slavery, wo might
go on for fifty or a hundred yesrs and not
a bubble come to the surface in the shape ot
a riot. They are not the fruit of American
institutions. They are rather in spite of
them. They are the disease that is injected
upon the healthy system of self govern
ment, so far as they exist at all. But we
are not a tiotous people. We are not afraid
to compare our history with England, France

The following passage meets the question
of
THE ISHl MASITT OF WAR.
" Much was said in England about the
inhumanity of war against our brethren.
As to that, war is inhuman against any Dooy,
and is no more inhuman for ns to bombard
Charleston and rebelliou than for Great
Britain to barn down a city of 180,000 in
habitants iu Japan. War is nothing but
police. Is it wrong for a policeman to col
lar a burglar or a thief and subdue him
Wax is nothing more. And if it be exer
cised according to the rules of war, it still ia
violence, and so far it is inhuman, because
crimes against the public peace require a
coercion aad a degree of cruelty which
justice must needs carry with it ; but they
that exercise justice are not responsible for
tbe cruelty, but they that bring it don up
on themselves. Cheers. But my reply
was generally this: It is not of so much im
portance to ask against whom it was waged
as to ask for what it ie waged. If you are
waging war for justice, lor haoianity, tor
(aw and liberty, then it makes ao difference
who your antagonist is. Against yonr own
father's son, against your own neighbor, if
you are called in the providence of God to
stand up and assert moral truth aad moral

mand; if any man come not after me aod

KEUOXSTIiUCTIO.ir THE PI Til
OF TUB fKEtlDEKT'S VIEW.
There hts been ten times more talk about
the theory of reconstruction than there is
any need of. The real difficulty has been
ia carrying any tiie ry into practice- First,
: we have to destroy the rebel armies, so that
any loyal government can exitt in the rebel
S'.ates.- 'Next, we mut confine .the exer
cise of the powers of tbe State Government
strictly to the honestly loyal people. Who
are they? Herein is lha pi'h of the mat
ter, aod in the answer to that question i tbe
pith of the President's Message. But,
before we refer to that, let as examine the
premises in which the President's conclu
sions are founded. The Constitution of
the United States, as we hive often said.
acts on individuals only,
Its strength lies
in the fact, that when any man. or numbtt cept jjjg 0ff.r? What interest do you snp

Government, that authority etrike down hM la rejectiog it ? Let us look for a mo
ion the rebel in spite of any State laws. ment at tjie DUmber of these people. Mr.
Lunatic as the States Rights party of the j rjeBow.one of the most bitter rebels, h ti e
outh has been, it is not able to deny that,
except by claiming that Secession is consti-
tutional. Hence it is that, ia the rebellion,
according to the whole practical theory of
the Constitution, it was individual rebel
led. If the States could not secede, much
'ess could its loyal inhabitants be in rebel
lion, because its rebel inhabitants noted un
der Stale laws. Hence, the sin of the State
being done by individuals, it salvation
come in tbe same way. The idea that the
rebel States are foreign States is nonsense.
The idea that a hundred thousand loyal peo
ple in Tennessee havo no right to resusci
tate their State Government, b .'cause the
majority have gone into rebellion, is an idea
of gross injustice. We are not at war with
foreign States. If we were, we ought to
make peace immediately, for we have no
wish to make foreign conquests. It is pre
cisely because they are not foreign States,
that we are fighting them. We are fighting
to conquer rebels iu arms against their le
gitimate Government. This is just, and so
recognized by intelligent men in all ages of
the world Iu the only cases where legiti
mate Government is overthrown successful
ly, it is historically and rightly attributed
to force alone. The only olaim of the P oles
to the sympathies of mankind is that their
own Government was overthrown by force.

fectl Why, she will remain in tbe Union
with all her slaves, defy Mr. Lincoln's proc
lamation, be restored to her forts, hold her
Secession Legislature, and proclaim State
Hights as furloosly as ever. The demon of
Slavery and rebellion will be there as much
as ever. This is what is meant by the
"Union as it was, and the Constitution as it
is." It is a Union with the bloodhounds
who have sprung at your throat and lapped
your blood till they ceased only for want of
strength. This is a construction of " loyal
people' which may suit Mr. Montgomery
Blair or Mr. Davis pf Ey, or Mr. James
Brooks of Now York, or Mr. Fernando
Wood; bat it does not sail the loyal people
of the West and North, who have shed their
blood, and pat forth their strength, and of
fer their wealth to destroy the dogs of reb
ellion. They want the destruction so com-,
plete that the work is never to be done again.
Who, then are the loyal people This is!
the precise thing Mr. Lincoln has undertak
en to define. And here we may ask, how
came Mr. Lincoln to offer his definition in
a new proclamation? Why, Mr. Fernando j
Wood, Mr. Vallandighhm, Mr. Voorhees,;
and all that ilk, are under great concern ot
mind that the President has never offered
the rebels aoy terms ol amnestytold them
anything by wbieh tbey choee, they might
retain to their beloved Union whom thev
have so long kicked and cuffed with all their
might. Tbe rebels were equally concerned.
They said: "You are 'be stronger; it is your
business to propose something " Mr. Lin
coln is an amiable man. aod a just man ; so
he saye; "Your loyal people may reconstruct
your lawa aad State Governments; and a
loyal man is first, ooe who cbeys my pro

neither regimeut, brigade, division, corps or
army in the rebel service. That is all. You
who are willing to renew yonr allegiance to
the laws and Government of the United
getting up this Rebellion, mast take their
chance to be tried as traitors."
Now, what objection is there to that mode
of reconstruction? It offers an amnesty
and re union to all who tefd obey the law
and Constitution a they now are,
, except
lonae-ine
only the leaders. Uoea any one imagine
that there are no people in the South to ao

times in number the slaveholders. Nor is
that all. Of these 87,000 slaveholders, near

cal villainy which has involved thirty rail

That is it exactly. A society founded on

spirators at Richmond accepted what was

it is, we are willing to leave the question to
the real Union men of the South. Is there
any probability that they will ever call the

The following article from Dr. Hall's
Journal of Health, contains practical hints
on various subjects that are worthy of
attention:
1. It is unwise to change to cooler clothing,
except when yon first get up in the morning.
2. Never ride with your arm or elbow
outaide any vehicle.
3. The man who attempts to alight from a
steam car while in motion is a fool.
4. In stepping from any wheeled vehicle
while in motion, let it be from the rear, and
not in front ot tbe wheels; for then, if you
fall, tbe wheels can not run over you.
5. Never attempt to cross a road or street
in a hurty, in front of a passing vehicle; f r
if you should stumble or slip, you will b
run over. Make up the half-minnte lost by
wailing until the vehicle has passed, by in
creased diligence in some other direction.
6. It is miserable economy to save time by
robbing yourself ot necessary sleep.
7. If you find yourself in-line i to wake
op at a regular hour in the night and remain
awake, you can break np the habit in three
days, by getting np as soon as von wake,
and not going to sleep again UD'il your usual
hour for retiring; or retire two hoars later,
and rise two hours earlier for three days iu
succession; not sleeping a moment in the
day time.
8. If infants and young children are in
clined to be wakeful in the night, or very
early in the morning, put them to bed liter;
and, besides, arrange that their dy nap
shall be in the forenoon.
9. "Order is heaven's first law," regularity
is nature's great rule; hence regularity in
eatiog, sleeping, and exercise, has a very
large share in securing a long and healthful
life. .

Men of the farm, let the paper trash is

ernment greenbacks are just suited to your
needs. Iniat upon a currency that shall
possess equal value in Maine and Minnesota.
Gold or Greenbacks should be the equiva
lent demanded by every farmer for bis pro

keep the irresponsible trash which bankers
or brokers are interested in keeping iu cir
cu'ation, and which will buro, some day,
the men who hold it.
Insist upon a currenoy that yon know
something about without referring to a de
tect t or bank n ite reporter. Uncle Sam's
money you know to be good. And the
only way to always keep it good, is to
keep it out of the hands nf tbe rnri
who get it in equal exchange for their own
irresponsible notes, and purch&se their own
promises to pay, ain. at a discount. To
day they are buying np these trashy paper
promises in this city al half per cent, dis
count ; and there ia little reason to doubt
that this discount will increase. Every body,
almost, is apprehending a great collapse in
consequence of tho great inflation of "cur
rency." And in certain circle tbis undue
iu 11a lion is charged npon the government ;
when teally the people, are responsible. For
if the government's money al me was used
ia business transactions, a bulk of currency
would be taken out of circulation which
ou!d relieve the market of any undue sur
plus. The fact is, the producing classes cannot
afford to bolster up these bank issues can
not afford to hold so much questionable pa
per in their hands. And this fact will coon
be demonstrated, or the signs of the times
are at fault. c. d. b.

"Iu Arkansas the advent of our army ,

Tennessee, in euiergi ig from tbe war,, will,

In Louisiana turned inside out and upside

The conduct of Messrs. Winslow, Lanier

ey to pay tbe interest on Indiana stocks,
is worthy of all praise. When compared ;
with the conduct of the 8tate officers, who
have taken an oath to do their duty by

ries, have done all in their power to dis
credit her and forfeit her good name, it be
comes the suljeot. of high admiration. This
is not the fir.t time this eminent firm have
shown liberality and a generoaa disposition
towards our State, When' the rebellion
first broke out, and before a war loan ooakl
bo effected, they teoderei the use of a large
amount ot mjney to the State authorities to
enable them to eqip our troop. And sub- '
sequently, before the war bonds could be
converted, they advanced 1 large isni at
