Good morning!
The Pennsylvania Railroad has allowed a week to go by with
out killing- anybody in Wilmington.
New Jersey will lose a good Governor, but the President will
gain a good counsellor and the Nation a valuable servant.
Speaker Reed sees no excuse for a long session of Congress, but
th'ere are Populists who can imagine no excuse 'for a short one but
paralysis of vocal cords.
No doubt Japan has great and legitimate interests in Hawaii.
No doubt, also, those interests will be properly considered in the
act of annexation, and will be just as secure under United States;

A movement is on foot to combine all the railway employes in;
the United States into one organization of more than 200,000 mem

Congressman Shafroth, of Colorado, is about to introduce a
bill providing that when the Government is in debt, the salaries of
all the administrative functionaries, from President down, shall be
scaled by a certain percentage. The "lopping" will begin with
members of Congr ss, quite properly. Tile inventor of this drastic
measure reckons that it will put ail end to the voting of millions
for unnecessarv projects, unless there be monev in the Treasury to
' '
meet the outlay.
Tin- last vestiges ot the "Paul Revere House" at Watertown,
Mass., disappeared on Monday, it is a pity that some patriotic
society did not make some effort to have the old building preserved
by removing it to another place It is worth while to take a little

It is interesting to note that the strongest naval lorce the United
States has assembled since the war is the North Atlantic Squadron
,
now going south to drill. Six oi the strongest battleships for the r
size in the world, with monitors, gunboats, cruisers nild torpedo 1
boats accompanying, make a formidable array. Of course, the.
Government considered neither Cuba nor Hayti in despatching
them to the vicinity of the West Indies. This is officially staled*
It was time for the regular drills. The men cannot be drilled in -
