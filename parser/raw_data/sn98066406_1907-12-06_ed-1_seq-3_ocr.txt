THE PRESIDENT'S
i I t
CAUSES OF THE PRESENT FINAN
CIAL CONDITIONS IS MADE
THE CHIEF TOPIC.
SUGGESTS REMEDIES FOR ILLS
CONTROL OF CORPORATIONS AND
RAILROADS TO PREVENT
OVERCAPITALIZATION.
Believes This Would Solve the Prob

More Elastic Currency Recom

Legislation Along Many Lines.
"Washington. Doc. 8. - President
Ttoosevelt a annual message to congress
Is a voluminous document of nearly
30,000 words, by far the longest mes
sage he ha ever submitted to congress.
The opening subject of t lie measure, is
the financial condition of the country,
and for which the president lays much
of the 'blame upon unscrupulous stock
peculators, and says:
"In any large body of men, however,
there are certain to be some who are
dishonest, and If the conditions are
uch that these men prosper or com
mit their misdeeds with Jmpunlty, their
example Is a very evil thin for the
community. Where these men are busi
ness men of great sagacity and of tem
perament both unscrupulous and reck
less, and where the conditions are such
that they act without supervision or
control and at first without effective
check frm public opinion, they delude
mairy Innocent people Into making In
vestments or embarking In kinds of
business that are really unsound.
"When the misdeeds of these successful
ly dishonest men are discovered, suf
fering comes not only upon them, but
upon the innocent men whom they
have misled. It is a painful awakening,
whenever it occurs; and, naturally,
when It does occur those who suffer
are apt to forget that the longer It was
deferred the more painful it would be.
In the effort to punish the guilty it is
both wise and proper to endeavor to
far as possible to minimize the dis
tress of those who have been misled by
th guilty. Yet It Is not possible to
refrain because of such distress from
trlving to put an end to the misdeeds
that are the ultimate causes of the suf
fering, and. as a means to this end,
where possible to punish those re
sponsible for them. There may be hon
est differences of opinion as to many
governmental policies; but surely there
can be no such differences as to the
need of unflinching perseverance In the
war against successful dishonesty."
lie quotes at length from his mes-
sage of last year la which he advo
cated federal control of corporations
doing interstate business, and believes
that in such control would bo found the
remedy for overcapitalization and
stock speculation which he believes
have brought about the present linan
cial conditions. He says:
"Our steady aim should be by legis
lation, cautiously and carefully under
taken, but resolutely persevered In, to
assert the sovereignty of the national
government by affirmative action.
"This is only In form an innovation.
In substance It is merely a restoration;
for from the earliest time such regula
tion of industrial activities has been
recognized in the action of the law
making bodies; and all that I propose
Is to meet the changed conditions in
auch manner as will prevent the com
monwealth abdicating the power it has
always possessed, not only. In this coun
. try. but also in England before and
since this country became a separate
nation.
Federal Control of
llallroads Is Favored.
"No small part of the trouble that we
have comes from carrying to an ex
treme the rational virtue of self-reliance,
of independence In initiative
and action. It is wise to conserve this
virtue and to provide for Its fullest ex
ercise, compatible with seeing that lib
erty does not become a liberty to
wrong others. Unfortunately, this is
the kind of liberty that the lack of all
effective regulation Inevitably breeds.
The founders of the constitution pro
vided that the national government
should have complete and sole control
of Interstate commerce. There was
then practically no Interstate business
save such as was conducted by water,
and this the national government at
once proceeded to regulate In thorough
going and effective fashion. Condi
tions have now so wholly changed that
the Interstate commerce by water Is In
significant compared with the amount
that goes by land, and almost all big
business concerns are now engaged in
Interstate commerce. As a result. It
can be but partially and Imperfectly
controlled or regulated by the action of
any one of the several states; such ac
tion inevitably tending to be either too
drastic or else too lax, and In either
case ineffective for purposes of Justice.
Only the national government can in
thoroughgoing fashion exercise the
needed control. This does not mean
that there should be any extension of
federal authority, for such authority
already exists under tho constitution In
amplest and most far-reaching form;
but It does mean that there should be
an extension of federal activity. This
Is not advocating centralization. It Is
merely looking facts In the face, and
realizing that centralization In business
has already come and can not be avoid
ed or undone, and that the public at
large can only protect Itself from cer
tain evil effects of this business cen
tralization by providing better methods
for the exercise of control through the
authority already centralized In the
national government by the constitu
tion Itself. There must be no halt in
the healthy constructive course of ac
tion which this nation has elected to
pursue, and has steadily pursued, dur
ing the last six years, as shown both in
the legislation of the congress and the
administration of the law by the de
partment of Justice. The most vital
need is In connection with the railroads.
As to these, in my Judgment there
should now be either a national Incor
poration act or a law licensing railway
companies to engage in Interstate com
merce upon certain conditions. The law
should be so framed as to give to the
Interstate commerce commission power
to pass upon the future Issue of securi
ties, while ample means should be pro
vided to enable the commission, when
ever in Its Judgment It is necessary, to
make a physical valuation of any rail
road. As I stated In my message to tho
congress a year ago, railroads should
ba given power to enter Into agree
ments, subject to these agreements be
ing made publlo la minute detail and to
the consent of the Interstate commerce
commission being first obtained. Until
tho national government assumes
proper control of Interstate commerce,
in the exercise of the authority It al
ready possesses. It will be Impossible
either to give to or to get from the
railroads full Justice. The railroads
and all other great corporations will
do well to recognize that this control
must come; the only question is as to
what governmental body can most
wisely exercise It. The courts will de
termine the limits within which the
federal authority can exercise It. and
there will still remain ample work
within each state for the railway com
mission of that state; and the national
interstate commerce commission will
work In harmony with the several state
commissions, each within Its own prov
ince, to achieve the desired end.
Control of Interstate
l)uJoea Concern I'rsred.
"Moreover, In my Judgment there should
be additional legislation looking to the
proper control of the great business con
cerns engaged in interstate business, this
control to be exercised for their own
benctlt and prosperity no less than for
the protection of Investors and of the
general public. As I have repeatedly
said In messages to congress and else
where, experience lias dellnitely shown
not merely the unwisdom but the futility
of endeavoring to put u slop to all busi
ness combinations. Modern industrial
conditions are such that combination IS
not only necessary but inevitable, it is
so In the world of business Just us It Is
so in the world of labor, and it is as idle
to desire to put an mi1 to all corpora
tions, to all big combinations of capital,
us to desire to put an end to combina
tions of labor. Corporation und labor
union alike have co:u to stay. lOach If
properly managed is a source of good
and not evil. Whenever in either there
is evil, it should be promptly held to ac
count; but it should receive hearty en
couriigonient so long as It Is properly
managed. It is profoundly immoral to
put or keep on the statute books a law,
tiomli wily In the Interest of public moral
ity, that really puts a premium upon
public immorality, by undertaking to
forbid honest men from doing what must
b done under modern business condi
tions, so that the law Itself provides that
its own Infraction must be the condition
precedent upon business success. To aim
at the Accomplishment of too much usu
ally weans the accomplishment of too lit
tle, and often the doing of positive dam
use. "The antitrust law should not be re
pealed; but it should be made both more
efficient and more in harmony with act
ual conditions. It should be so amended
as to forbJ only the kind of combination
which dooe harm to the general public,
such amendment to be accompanied by,
or to be un incident of. a grant of su
pervisory power to the government over
these big corporations engaged in Inter
state business. This should be accom
panied by provision for the compulsory
publication of uccounts and the subjec
tion of books and papers to the inspec
tion of the government officials. A be
ginning lias already been made for such i
supervision by the establishment of the
bureau of corporations.
"The antitrust law should not prohibit
combinations that do no injustice to the
public, still' less those the existence of
which is on the whole of benefit to the
public. But even if this feature of the
law were abolished, there would remain
as an equally objectionable feature the
difficulty and delay now incident to its
enforcement. The government must now
submit to Irksome and repeated delays
before obtaining a final decision of the
courts upon proceedings instituted, and
even a favorable decree may mean an
empty victory. Moreover, to attempt to
control these corporations by lawsuits
means to Impose uson both the depart
ment of Justice and the courts an Im
possible burden; It Is not feasible to carry
on more than a limited number of such
suits. Such a law to be really effective
must of course be administered by an
executive body, and not merely by means
of lawsuits. The design should be to
prevent the abuses Incident to the crea
tion of unhealthy and Improper combina
tions, Instead of waiting until they are
In existence and then attempting to de
stroy them by civil or criminal proceed
ings. Investing- Public Should
De Amply Safeguarded.
"The congress has the power to charter
corporations to engage In Interstate and
foreign commerce, and a general law can
be enacted under the provisions of which
existing corporations could take out fed
eral charters and new federal corpdra
tlons could be created. An essential pro
vision of such a law should be a method
of predetermining by some federal board
or commission whether the applicant for
a federal charter was an association or
combination within the restrictions of the
federal law. Provision should also be
made for complete publicity In all matters
affecting the public and complete protec
tion to the investing public and the share
holders in the matter of issuing corporate
securities. If an incorporation law is not
deemed advisable, a license act for big
.Interstate corporations might be enacted;
or a combination of the two might be
tried. The supervision established might
be analogous to that now exercised over
national banks. At least, the antitrust
act should be supplemented by specific
prohibitions of the methods which ex
perience has shown have been of most
service in enabling monopolistic combina
tions to crush out competition. The real
owners of a corporation should be com
pelled to do business in their own name.
The right to hold stock In other corpora
tions should heareafter be denied to Inter
state corporations, unless on approval by
the proper government officials, and a
prerequisite to such approval should be
the listing with the government of all
owners and stockholders, both by the
corporation owning such stock and by
the corporations in which such stock is
owned.
"To confer upon the national govern
ment, in connection with the amendment
I advocate In the antitrust law, power of
supervision over big business concerns
engaged in interstate commerce, would
benefit them as It has benefited the na
tional banks. In the recent business
crisis ft is noteworthy that the institu
tions which failed were Institutions
which were not under the supervision and
control of the national government.
Those which were under national con
trol stood the test.
"National control of the kind above ad
vocated would be to the benefit of every
well-managed railway. From the stand
point of the public there Is need for ad
ditional tracks, adltlonal terminals, and
Improvements In the actual handling of
the railroads, and all Ills as rapidly as
possible. Ample, "safe, and speedy trans
portation facilities are even more neces
sary than cheap transportation. There
fore, there is need for the Investment of
money which will provide for all these
things while at the same time securing as
fas ns Is possible better wages and
shorter hours for their employes. There
fore, while there must be Just and rea
sonable regulation of rfltcs, we should be
the first to protest against any arbitrary
and unthinking movement to cut them
down without the fullest and most care
ful consideration of all Interests con
cerned and of the actual needs of the
situation. Only a special body of men
acting for the national government un
der authority conferred upon it by the
congress is competent to pass Judgment
on such a matter,
(renter Klaatlclty la
Currency Is I'rged.
The president (Juotes extensively from
his last message la dealing with the di
rect subject of currency legislation, and
suys:
"1 again urge on the congress the need
of Immediate attention to this matter.
We need a. greater elasticity in our cur
rency; provided, of course, that we recog
nize the even greater need of a safe and
secure currency. There must always be
the most rigid examination by the na
tional authorities, Provision should be
made for an emergency currency. The
emergency Issue should, of course, be
made with an effective guaranty, and r -on
conditions carefully prescribed by tne
government. Such emergency Issue must
bo based on adequate securities approved
by the government, and must be Issued
under a heavy tax. This would permit
currency being Issued when the demand
for It was urgent, while securing Its re
tirement ns the demand fell off. It is
worth investigating to determine whether
ofllcers and directors of national banks
should ever be allowed to loan to them
selves. Trust companies should be sub
ject to the same supervision as banks;
legislation to this effect should be en
acted for the District of Columbia and
the territories.
"Yet we must also remember that even
the wisest legislation on the subject can
only accomplish a certain amount. No
legislation can by any possibility guar
antee the business community against the
results of speculative folly any more than
It can guarantee an Individual against the
results of his extravagance. When an in
dividual mortgages his house to buy an
automobile he invites disaster; and whe-n
wealthy men, or men who pose as such,
or are unscrupulously or foolishly eager
to become such. Indulge in reckless spec
ulationespecially If it Is accompanied by
dishonesty they Jeopardize not only their
own future but the future of nil their In
nocent fellow-citizens, for they expose
the whole business community to panic
and distress."
He advises against any general tariff
legislation this session of congress, and
says:
"In a country of such phenomenal
growth as ours it is probably well that
every dozen years or so the tariff laws
should be carefully scrutinized so as to
see that no excessive or improper bene
fits are conferred thereby, that proper
revenue is provided, and that our
foreign trade Is encouraged. There
must always be as a minimum
a tariff which will not only al
low for the collection of an ample rev
enue but which will at toast make
good the difference in cost of production
here and nbroad; that Is, the difference in
the labor cost here and abroad, for the
well-being of the wage-worker must ever
be a cardinal point of American policy.
The question should be approached pure
ly from a business standpoint; both the
time and the manner of the change being
such as to arouse the minimum of agi
tation and disturbance In the business
world, and to give the least play for
selfish and factional motives. The sole
consideration should be to see that the
sum total of changes represent the pub
lic good. This means that the subject
cannot with wisdom be dealt with in the
year preceding a presidential election, be
cause as a matter of fact experience has
conclusively shows that at such a time
it is Impossible to get men to treat It from
the standpoint of the public good. In my
Judgment the wise time to deal with the
matter 1 Immediately after such elec
tion."
He asks for the repeal of the tariff on
paper and wood pulp.
He reviews and enlarges upon his pre
vious recommendations for the enact
ment of federal inheritance and Income
tax laws.
Attention Is called to the prosecution of
wealthy offenders against the national
laws, and In this connection he asks that
the laws under which these prosecutions
are brought be strengthened and made
more definite.
The Use and the
Abuse of Injunctions-
"Instances of abuse In the granting of
Injunctions In labor disputes continue to
occur, and the resentment in the minds
of those who feel that their rights are
being invaded and their liberty of action
and of speech unwarrantably restrained
continues to grow. Much of the attack
on the use of the process of injunction is
wholly without warrant; but I am con
strained to express the belief that for
some of It there Is warrant. This ques
tlon is becoming more and more of prime
Importance, and unless the courts will
themselves deal with It in effective man
ner, It Is certain ultimately to demand
some form of legislative action. It would
be most unfortunate for our social wel
fare If wo should permit many honest
and law-abiding citizens to feel that
they had Just causes for regarding our
courts with hostility. I earnestly com
mend to the attention of the congress
this matter, so that some way may be
devised which will limit the abuse of In
junctions and protect those rights which
from time to time It unwarrantably In
vades. Moreover, discontent is often ex
pressed with the use of the process of
Injunction by the courts, not only in la
bor disputes, but where state laws are
concerned. I refrain from discussion of
this question as I am Informed that It
will soon receive the consideration of the
supreme court."
Of other legislation In the Interest of
labor he favors federal Inspection of rail
roads; providing limited but definite com
pensation for accidents to all workmen
employed in any way by the government.
and says:
"The constitutionality of the employers'
liability act passed by the preceding con
gress has been carried before the courts
In two Jurisdictions the law has been de
clared unconstitutional, and in three Juris'
dictions its constitutionality has been af
firmed. The question has been carried to
tne supreme court, the case has been
heard by that tribunal, and a decision is
expected at an early date. In the event
that the court should affirm the consti
tutionality of the act. I urge further leg
Islatlon along the lines advocated In my
message to the preceding congress. The
practice of. putting the entire burden of
loss of life or limb upon the victim or
tne victim s family Is R form of social In
Justice In which the United States stands
in unenviable prominence. In both our
federal and our state legislation we have,
with few exceptions, scarcely gone
farther than the repeal of the fellow
servant principle of the old law of liabil
ity, and In some of our states even this
slight modification of a complete out
grown principle has not yet been se
cured."
He favors the extension of the eight
hour law to all departments of the gov
ernment, and to all work carried on by
the government. He urges legislation
for the compulsory Investigation of in
dustrlal disputes, and says:
"The need for some provision for such
Investigation was forcibly illustrated
during the past summer. A strike of
telegraph operators seriously Interfered
with telegraphic communication, caus
Ing great damage to business Interests
and serious Inconvenience to the gen
eral public. Appeals were made to me
from many parts of the country, from
city councils, from boards of trade,
from chambers of commerce, and from
labor organizations, urging that steps
be taken to terminate the strike
livery thing that could with any pro
priety be done by a representative of
the government was done without avail
and for weeks the public stood by and
suffered without recourse of any kind
Had the machinery existed and had
there been authority for compulsory
investigation of the dispute, the public
would have been placed In possession
of the merits cf the controversy, and
public opinion would probably have
brought about prompt adjustment.
"It is idle to bold that without good
laws evils such as child labor, as the
over-working of women, as the fail
ure to protect employes from loss of
life or limb, can be effectively reached.
any more than the evils of rebates and
stock-watering can be reached without
good laws. To fall to stop these prac
tices by legislation means to force
honest men Into them, because other
wise the dishonest who surely will
take advantage of them will have
everything their own way. If the states
will correct these evils, well and good;
but the nation must stand ready to aid
them.
Inland Waterway Systems
Should De I)evIoped.
'The conservation of our national re
sources and their prooer use constitute
the fundamental problem which under
lies almost every other problem of our
national life. We must maintain for
our civilization the adequate material
basis without which that civilization
cannot exist. We must show foresight.
we must look ahead. As a nation we
not only enjoy a wonderful measure of
present prosperity but If this prosper
ity Is used aright it is an earnest of
future success such as no other nation
will have. The reward of foresight foi
this nation is great and easily foretold.
Hut there must be the look ahead,
there must be a realization of the fact
that to waste, to destroy, our natural
resources, to skin and exhaust the land
Instead of using it so as to increase its
usefulness, will result in undermining
In the days of our children the very
prosperity which we ought by right to
hand down to them amplified and devel
oped. For the last few years, through
several agencies, the government has
been endeavoring to get our people to
look ahead and to substitute a planned
and orderly development of our re
sources in place of a haphazard striv
ing for immediate profit. Our great
river systems should be developed as
national water highways; the Missis
sippi, with Its tributaries, standing first
in Importance, and the Columbia sec
ond, although there are many others of
Importanae on the Pacific and Atlantic
and the gulf slopes. The national gov
ernment should undertake this work,
and I hope a beginning will be made
In the present congress; and the great
est of all our rivers, the Mississippi,
should receive especial attention. From
the Great LaTtcs to the mouth of the
Mississippi there should be a deep wa
terway, with deep waterways leading
from it to the east and the west. Such
a waterway would practically mean
the extension of our coast line into the
very heart of our country. It would be
of Incalculable benefit to our people. If
begun at once it can be carried through
In time appreciably to relieve the con
gestion of our great freight-carrying
lines of railroads. The work should be
systematically and continuously carried
forward In accordance with some well
conceived plan. The main streams
should be Improved to the highest
point of efficiency before the Improve
ment of the branches is attempted: and
the work should be kept free from
every taint of recklessness or Jobbery."
Attention Is called to the work of Ir
rigation and reclamation of govern
ment lands. In the same connection he
asks for a revision of the public land
laws along the lines proposed by the
public lands commission. Believes the
government should Increase Its efforts
to conserve our forests and should In
crease by purchase the existing forest
preserves. On the subject of the natural
resources of the nation he says:
"In the eastern United States the
mineral fuels have already passed Into
the hands of large private owners, and
those of the west are rapidly following,
It Is obvious that these fuels should be
conserved and not wasted, and it would
be well to protect the people against
unjust and extortionate prices, so far
as that can still be done. What has
been accomplished in the great oil
fields of the Indian Territory by the
action of the administration offers a
striking example of the good results
of such a policy. In my Judgment the
government should have the right to
keep the fee of the coal, oil and gas
fields in Its own possession and to lease
the rights to develop them under
proper regulations; or else, if the con
gress will not adopt this method, the
coal deposits should be sold under lim
itations, to conserve them as public
utilities, the right to mine coal being
separated from the title to the soil.
The regulations should permit coal
lands to De worked In sufficient quan
tity by the several corporations. The
present limitations have been absurd,
excessive, and serve no useful purpose,
and often render It necessary that
there should be either fraud or else
abandonment of the work of getting
out the coal."
Progress of the Work
On the Panama Canal.
"Work on the Panama canal Is pro
ceeding in a highly satisfactory man
ner. In March the total excavation in
the Culebra Cut. where effort was
chiefly concentrated, was 815.270 cubic
yards. In April this was increased to
879.527 cubic yards. There was a con
siderable decrease In the output for
May and June owing partly to the ad
vent of the rainy season and partly to
temporary trouble with the steam
shovel men over the question of wages.
This trouble was settled satisfactorily
to all parties and in July the total ex
cavation advanced materially and in
August the grand total from all points
In the canal prism by steam shovels
and dredges exceeded all previous
United States records, reaching 1,274.
404 cubic yards. In September this rec
ord was eclipsed and a total of 1.517,
412 cubic yards was removed. Of this
amount 1,481.307 cubic yards were from
the canal prism and 36,105 cubic yards
were from accessory works. These re
sults were achieved in the rainy sea
son with a rainfall in August of 11.89
inches and in September of 11.65 Inches.
Finally, in October, the record was
again eclipsed, the total excavation be
ing 1.868.729 cubic yards; a truly ex
traordinary record, especially In view
of the heavy rainfall, which was 17.1
inches. In fact, experience during the
last two rainy seasons demonstrates
that the rains are a less serious ob
stacle to progress than has hitherto
been supposed.
"Work on the locks and dams at
Oatun. which began actively in March
last, has advanced so far that It is
thought that masonry work on the
locks can be begun within 15 months.
"Last winter bids were requested and
received for doing the work of canal
construction by contract. None of them
was found to be satisfactory and all
were rejected. It Is the unanimous
opinion of the present commission that
the work can be done better, more
cheaply, and more quickly by the gov
ernment than by private contractors.
Fully 80 per cent, of the entire plant
needed for construction has been pur
chased or contracted for; machine
shops have been erected and equipped
for making all needed repairs to the
plant; many thousands of employes
have been secured; an effective organi
zation has been perfected; a recruiting
'system is In operation whloh Is jc.lpable
of furnishing more labor than can be
used advantageously; employes are
well sheltered and well fed; salaries
paid are satisfactory, and the work Is
not only going forward smoothly, but
it is producing results far In advance
of the most sanguine anticipations.
Under these favorable conditions, a
change In the method of prosecuting
the work would be unwise and unjusti
fiable, for It would Inevitably disorgan
ize existing conditions, check progress,
and increase the cost and lengthen the
time of completing the canal.
President Ilecommrads
Postal Savings Ilauka.
"I commend to the favorable consid
eration of the congress a postal sav
ings bank system, as recommended by
the postmaster general. The primary
object Is to encourage among our peo
ple economy and thrift and by the use
of postal savings banks to give them
an opportunity to husband their re
sources, particularly those who have
not the facilities at hand for depositing
their money in savings banks. Viewed,
however, from the experience of the
past few weeks, it Is evident that the
advantages of such an institution are
still more far-reaching. Timid depos
itors have withdrawn their savings for
the time being from national banks; in
dividuals have hoarded their cash and
th worklngmen their earnings; all
of which money lias been withdrawn
and kept in hiding or in the safe de
posit box to the detriment of pros
perity. Through the agency of the pos
tal savings banks such money would be
restored to the channels of trade, to
the mutual benefit of capital and labor.
"I further commend to the congress
the consideration of the postmaster
general's recommendation for an ex
tension of the parcel post, especially on
the rural routes. There are now 38,
215 rural routes, serving nearly 10,000,
000 people who do not have the ad
vantages of the Inhabitants of cities In,
obtaining their supplies. I hese recom
mendations have been drawn up to
benefit the fr.rmer and the country
storekeeper; otherwise, I should not
favor them, for I bnlieve that it is good
policy for our government to do every
thing possible to aid the small town
and the country district. It is desirable
that the country merchant should not
be crushed but.
"The fourth-class postmasters' con
vention lias passed a very strong reso
lution in favor of placing the fourth
class postmasters under the civil-service
law. The administration has al
ready put Into effect the policy of re
fusing to remove any fourth-class post
masters save for reasons connected
with the good of Uie service; and it is
endeavoring so far as possible to re
move them from the domain of partisan
politics. It would be a most desirable
thing to put the fourth-class postmas
ters in the classified service."
He renews his recommendations of
last year in regard to Alaska; calls at
tention to the admission of Oklahoma
as a state; urges the importance of pro
viding shipping relief for Hawaii; asks
for citizenship for Porto Itlcans, and
promises submission of Secretary
Tuffs report on Philippines when that
official returns.
He asks for the creation of a bureau
of mines; recommends the providing of
funds for preserving The Hermitage,
the home of Andrew Jackson; and the
erection of a naval monument at
Vicksburg.
Corporation Contributions
lo Coiupaljtn Miprnar.
"Under our form of government voting
is not merely a right but a duty, and,
moreover, a fundaments and necessary
duty if a man Is to be a good citizen
It is well to provide that corporations
shall not contribute to presidential or
national campaigns, and furthermore to
provide for the publication of both con
tributlons and expenditures. There Is,
however, always danger in laws of this
kind, which from their very nature are
difficult of enforcement: the danger being
lest they be obeyed only by the honest.
and disobeyed by the unscrupulous, so
as to act only as a penalty upon honest
men. Moreover, no such law would ham
per an unscrupulous man of unlimited
means from buying his own way Into of
fice. There is a very radical measure
which would, I believe, work a substan
tial improvement in our system of con
ducting a campaign, although I am well
aware that it will take some time for
people to so familiarize themselves with
such a proposal as to be willing to con
slder Its adoption. The need for collect
Ing large campaign funds would vanish it
congress provided an appropriation for
the proper and legitimate expenses of
each of the great national parties, an ap
propriation ample enough to meet the
necessity for thorough organization and
machinery, which requires a large ex
penditure of money. Then the stlpula
tion should be made that no party re
eelvlng campaign funds from the treasury
should accept more than a fixed amount
from any individual subscriber or donor;
and the necessary publicity for receipts
and expenditures could without difficulty
be provided."
Want Improvement la the
Orean Mall Service.
"I call your especial attention to the tin
satisfactory condition of our foreign mall
service, which, because of the lack of
American steamship lines, is now largely
done through foreign lines, and which,
particularly bo far as South and Central
America are concerned, is done In a man
ner which constitutes a serious barrier
to the extensions of our Commerce.
"The time has come, In my Judgment,
to set to work seriously to make our
ocean mall service correspond more
closely with our recent commercial and
political development. A beginning was
made by the ocean mall act of March 3,
isai, but even at that time the act was
known to be Inadequate in various par
ticulars. Since that time events have
moved rapidly In our history. We have
acquired Hawaii, the Philippines, and
lesser Islands in the Pacific. We are
steadily prosecuting the great work of
uniting at the Isthmus the waters of the
Atlantic and the Pacific. To a greater
extent than seemed probably even
dozen years ago we may look to an
American future on the sea worthy of
the tradition of our past. As the first
step In that direction, and the step most
feasible at the present time, I recommend
the extension of the ocean mall act of
ISM. That act has stood for some years
free from successful criticism of its prin
clple and purpose. It was based on theo
rles of the obligations of a great marl
time nation, undisputed In our own land
find followed by other nations since the
beginning of steam navigation. Ilrlefly
L those theories are. that it is the duty of
a first-class power so rar as practicable
to carry Its ocean malls under Its own
flag; that the fast ocean steamships and
their crews, required for such mall serv
Ice, are valuable auxiliaries to the sea
power of a nation. Furthermore, the
construction of such steamships insures
the maintenance In an efficient condition
of the shipyards in which our battleships
must be built.
"The expenditure of public money for
the performance of such necessary func
tlons of government Is certainly war
ranted, nor Is It necessary to dwell upon
the Incidental benefits to our foreign
commerce, to the shipbuilding industry,
and to ship owning and navigation which
will accompany the discharge of these
urgent public duties, though they, too,
should have weight."
Ask Increase la Pay
for Army Officer und Men.
The president devotes much space to
the affairs of the army, and strongly
urges that our regular military organi
zation he kept up to the highest possible
standard of efficiency, and says: .
"The medical corps should be much
greater than the needs of our regular
army In war. Yet at present It Is small
er than the needs of the service demand
even in peace. The Spanish war oc
curred less than ten years ago. The
chief loss we suffered In It' was by dis
ease among the regiments which never
left the country. At the moment the
nation seemed deeply Impressed by this
fact; yet seemingly It has already eer
forgotten, for not the slightest effort
has been made to prepare a medical
corps of sufficient Blze to prevent the
repetition of the same disaster on a
much larger scale if we should ever be
engaged In a serious conflict.'
Put the medical department Is not the
only department for which Increased pro
vision should be made. .The rate of pay
for the officers should be greatly in
creased; there Is no higher type of citizen
than t lie. American regular officer, and he
should have a fair reward for his ad
mirable work. There should be a rela
tively even greater Increase in t lie pay for
the enlisted men. An espe -lal provision
should be made for establishing grades
equivalent to those of warrant officers In
the navy, which should be open to the
enlisted men who serve sufficiently long
an'1 who do their work well. Inducements
should be offered sufficient to encourage
really good men to make the army a life
occupation. The prime needs of our pres
ent army Is to secure and retain compe
tent noncommissioned officers. This diffi
culty rests fundamentally on tho ques
tion of pay. The noncommissioned officer
does not correspond with an unskilled la
borer: he corresponds to the best type of
skilled workman or to the subordinate
official in civil Institutions. Wages have
greatly increased In outside occupations
in tho last 40 years and the pay of the
soldier, like the pay of the officers, should
be proportionately increased. The first
sergeant of a company, if a good man.
ust be one of such executive and ad
ministrative ability, and such knowledge
of his trade, as to be worth far more than
we at present pay him. The same is true
of the regimental sergeant major. These
men should be men who had fully re
solved to make the army a life occupa
tion and they should be able to look for
ward to ample reward: while only men
properly qualified should be given a
chance to secure these final rewards. The
Increase over the present pay need not
be great In the lower grades for the first
one or two enlistments, but the Increase
should be marked for the noncommis
sioned officers of the upper grades who
serve long enough to make It evident that
they intend to stay permanently in the
army, while additional pay Rhould b
given for high qualifications In target
practice,
"Among the officers there should be
severe examinations to weed out the
unfit up to the grade of major. From
that position on appointments should
be solely by selection and It should be
understood that a man of merely av
erage capacity could never get beyond
the position of major, while every man
who serves in any grade a certain
length of time prior to promotion to
the next grade without getting the
promotion to the next grade should be
forthwith retired."
President Seen Need of
I.arcely Increased 'nvy.
The president asks for a continuous
Increase In the navy, and asks present
congress for appropriations for four
new battleships, and says:
"We need always to remember that
In time of war the navy Is not to be
used to defend harbors and sea-coast
cities; we should perfect our system of
coast fortifications. The only efficient
use for the navy Is for offense. The
only way In which it can efficiently pro
tect our own coast against the possible
action of a foreign navy is by destroy
ing that foreign navy. For defense
against a hostile fleet which actually
attacks them, the coast cities must de
pend upon their forts, mines, torpedoes,
submarines and torpedo boats and de
stroyers. All of these together are ef
ficient for defensive purposes, but they
In no way supply the place of a thor
oughly efficient navy capable of acting
on the offensive: for parrying never yet
won a fight. It can only be won by
hard hlting. and an agcressive sea-going
navy alone can do this hard hitting
of the offensive type. Put the forts
and the like are necessary so thnt the
navy may be footloose. In time of war
there is sure to be demand, under pres
sure of fright, for the ships to be scat
tered so as to defend all kind of ports.
Under penalty of terrible disaster, this
demand must be refused. The ships
must be kept together, and their ob
jective made the enemies' fleet. If
fortifications are sufficiently strong, no
modern navy will venture to attack
them, so long as the foe has In exist
ence a hostile navy of anything like
the same size or efficiency. But unless
there exists Buch a navy then the forti
fications are powerless by themselves
to secure the victory. For of course
the mere deficiency means thnt any
resolute enemy can at his leisure com
bine all his forces upon one point with
the certainty that he can take it.
Gives Itennona for Despatch
Of Fleet to the Pacific.
"Until our battle fleet Is much larger
than at present It should never be split
Into detachments so far apart that they
could not in event of emergency be
speedily united. Our coast line Is on
the Taclfie Just as much as on the At
lantic. The Interests of California,
Oregon and Washington ore as em
phatically the Interests of the whole
union as those of Maine and New York,
of Louisiana and Texas. The battle
fleet should now and then be moved to
the Pacific, Just as at other times It
should be kept In the Atlantic. -When
the Isthmian canal is built the transit
of the battle fleet from one ocean to
the other will be comparatively easy.
Until It Is built I earnestly hope that
the battle fleet will be thus shifted be
tween the two oceans every year or
two. The marksmanship on all our
ships has Improved phenomenally dur
ing the last five years. Until within
the last two or three years it was not
possible to train a battle fleet In squad
ron maneuvers under service conditions,
and it Is only during tl'iese Inst two or
three years that the training under
these conditions has become really ef
fective. Another and most necessary
stride In advance is now being taken,
'ihe battle fleet is about starting by
the Straits of Magellan to visit the
Pacific coast. Sixteen battleships ari
going under the command of Rear Ad
miral Kvans. while eight armored
cruisers and two other battleships will
meet him at Pan Francisco, whither
certain torpedo destroyers are also go
ing. No fleet of such siz has ever
made such a voyage, and It will be of
very great educational use to all en
gaged In It. The only way by which to
teach officers and men how to handle
the fleet so as to meet every possible
strain and emergency In time of war is
to have them practice under similar
conditions in time of peace. Moreover,
the only way to find out our actual
needs is to perform In time of peace
whatever maneuvers might be neces
sary in time of war. After war Is de
clared It is too late to find out the
needs; that means to Invite disaster.
The trip to the Pacific will show what
some of our needs are and will enable
us to provide for them. The proper
place for an officer to learn his duty
Is at sea. and the only way In which a
navy can ever be made efficient Is by
practice at sea. tinder all the condi
tions which would have to be met If
war existed."
He reviews the work accomplished
by the second peace conference at The
Hague; notes the Improvement of af
fairs In Cuba, and the preparations be
ing made to reestablish the govern
ment of the Island republic; asks per
mission to cancel the remainder of
China's Indemnity obligation to us. and
reviews the effect of Secretary Roofs
visit to Mexico.

RUTH'S WISE 3
CHOICE
Sunday School Lesson for Dec. 8, 19C7
Specially Arranged for This P2per
I.K.SSON TKXT.-Ituth 1:14-22. Memory
Verses, 16. IT.
UOl.DKN TKXT. "Thy people shall be
mv people, und thy (Jod my God." ltutli
1:16.
TIMK. Ruth belongs to the times of
the Judges, possibly In the time of Gideon,
H. C, 1222-UX2. or in the early part of tins
judgeship of Ell, when East Israel was op
pressed by Amorites. and West Israel by
the Philistines (1131). As she was the
great grandmother of David, either date
is possible. The dates are the common
ones in our Hible. Some scholars place
David's date considerably later.
PIACfi. The early home of Naomi and
the later one of ltuth wus at Uethleheiii.
around which so many Interesting events
cluster. The early home of Uuth was in
Moab, east of the Dead Sea and southern
Jordan.
Comment and Suggestive Thought.
The Two Decisions. The two wid
owed daughters-in-law, Orpah, the
"Fawn," and Kuth, "the Hose of
Moab," went part of the way to see
Naomi off, as friends and relative
were accustomed to do, and as is still
the custom in the east. When the time
came to part,, when they had kissed
each other and wept together, .they
both declared they would not return,
but would go with her to Israel, "Like
a wise woman, she declined to take
advantage of the impulse of passion
ate regret, which seemed adverse to
their temporal welfare, and which
their cooler judgment might not sanc
tion, and urged them, by many strong
arguments, to return." "God wrestled
with Jacob with desire to be con
quered; so Naomi, no doubt, opposed
Hath, hoping and wishing that she
herself might be foiled." T. Fuller.
She would have Huth fully understand
her own mind, and realize what the
decision would cost her. So in th3
parable of Christ (Luke 14: 20-33).
So Joshua, in his farewell address to
his people, when urging them with all
his soul to be true to their God, even
after their declaration "God forbid
that we should forsake the Lord"
tells them, "Ye cannot serve tha
Lord" (Josh. 24: 21).
Orpah decides to go back to her
people. There was little to attract her
to a new and strange, home, with pov
erty in prospect, with little hope that
she would be welcome to the exclusive
Jews, to whom, as well as to her
mother, she might become a burden
nothing to attract her except love and
religion. . Neither of these did sho
possess in a degree sufficient to over
come the obstacles in the way. We
do not know whether she returned to
the worship of idols or whether she,
at least in private, clung to the re
ligion and the God she had learned
I from Naomi
Huth. with a deeper nature and
clearer insight, with a love to Naomi
that would cheer and strengthen her,
I and a consciousness of her need of
God and love to God that made all
I other blessings as nothing in compari
son, clave unto Naomi, and, like Mary,
chose the good part which shall not
be taken away from her.
V. 16. "And Huth said." "Ruth's
passionate burst of tenderness Is Im
mortal. It has put into fitting words
for all generations the deepest
ttoughts of loving hearts, and comes
to us over all the centuries between
as warm and living as when it welled
up from that pure, heroic soul. The
two strongest emotions of our nature
are blended in it, and each gives a por
tion of its fervor love and religion."
Maclaren.
Orpah and Huth. starting together
for the promised land, and one return
ing to idolatry, while the other goes
on to Immortal blessedness, are par
alleled by the characters In the early
part of Hunyan's "Pilgrim's Progress,"
where Christian and hJs neighbors
start together for the Celestial City
Christian goes on, while Obstinate
and Pliable soon return to the City of
Destruction. "It might have been"
sums up the tragedy of many a life.
Choices between good and evil, even
in small things, are the most Im
portant acts of our lives. They art
the creative acts of the soul. Often
these fateful crises come in our lives
In connection with decisions of tha
Importance of which we do not dream.
We know what Is right; we do nol
know the far-reaching effects.
The Outcome of Ruth's Choice. Sc
far we have been reading the Introduc
tion to Ruth's romantic love story, a
companion picture in common life to
the picture In Solomon's song portray
Ing the love of a great king.
It is well to have these two plcturei
in the Itlble gallery, because home
and holy love are essential conditions
of the transforming this world Into
the kingdom of God. Home and loiM
open the gates to Paradise. The stq '
of nethlehem for the race stands ovei
the home with Jesus In It.
The greatest reward both of Boa
and of Ruth arises from the fact that
they were the ancestors of King
David, the greatest of Israel's kings,'
and of David's greater ton, Jesus, tha
prince of peace.
"Here we have the eternal appre
elation of evcry-day virtue and service
In the midst of little, ordinary things,
and the divine recognition of these as
powers In making the world what God
wants It to be. It Is meant to tcacb
that In the timldcst breast of timid
woman thero may reside an energy
which affects human life and the des
tinles of ages moro even than clatter
Ing arms and clashing armies
And Ruth, bringing into Judah only
woman's heart filled with a wonderfu'
love, was able to do more for th
land of her exile than Its soldUri
spending thenisclvet la battle,"
