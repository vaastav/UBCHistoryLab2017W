mer, sergeant, who married Heloise
dreen of North Topeka in El Paso
Thanksgiving day, is in the city Jail
under arrest as a deserter from the
army. Apparently he deserted
Heloise also but the telegram upon
which he was arrested says nothing
about that.
IThe bride of a week is in El Paso
and her mother. Mrs. Herbert C.
Qreen of 921 North Harrison street, is
considerably worried about her today.
"Kramer was taken off a Rock Is
land train Tuesday night by Chief
Harvey Parsons, Robert Miler and
Karl Porter. They were acting upon
information received by the sheriff's
oWice and from the conductor of the
train. The conductor, who naa re
ceived a telegram from army officials
at El Paso, located Kramer upon his
train long before it reached Topeka
bttt he telegraphed ahead and held
the man until the train reached here.
The telegram from army officers
states that Kramer is a sergeanf in the
commissary department and that he
is'a deserter. Kramer didn't deny to
day that he is a deserter but he has
a long tale of woe excusing himself.
Troubles With Wife.
'.According to his story, which was
not believed by the police in the be
ginning, he married Heloise Green at
KJ .Paso Thanksgiving day and every
thing looked rosy.
:ily superior officers knew I got
married and everything was all
riht," he said, "but since then I dis
covered that my wife had too many
affinities. 1 couldn't stand it when I
made the discovery. I simply blew
up. and beat it. I didn't rtop to think
whether I was deserting or not. I
knew I was deserting her."
"Kramer said his wife former.y lived
in Topeka and that from his informa
tion her parents live at 921 North
Harrison street. The house was called
by telephone and Mrs. Green verified
a part of his story. She stated that her
daughter, Heloise. had been working
in the Popular Dry Goods store at El
PaPo for some months and that she
received a telegram Thanksgiving' day
to- the effect that she was married.
She also gave her husband's name as
Fred G. Kramer.
i . Knew Nothing of Cliarge.
She knew nothing of the "-ffinity"
feature of Kramer's story but she did
know, she said, that Kramer or his
wife had obtained $200 from her since
the marriage.
Where is Heloise?" she asked the
officer. 'I'm not interested in this de
sester but I would like to know where
my daughter is."
Officers could shed no light .on that
subject. The last Kramer saw of her
Eh was in El Paso.
'The teiegram received by local of
ffcers instructed them to place Kra
mer in the hands of army officers
cither at Fort Riley or Fort Leaven
worth as soon as possible. Arrange
ments were made today to turn him
over to the captain in charge of the
loqal recruiting station.

HOLDS SPOTLIGHT
High Cost of Living Center of
Congressional Stage.
Tho President Wilson Ignored
It in His Message.
MANY MEASURES INTRODUCED
Resolution by Martine Would
Put Ban on Exports.
Congress Awaits Recommenda
tion of Wilson and Cabinet.
Washington, Dec. 6. Action by con
gress on any food price legislation will
await the recommendation of Presi
dent Wilson and his cabinet.
Such executive recommendation
will be based on the reports, some of
which the president had already been
receiving for some days, from the va
rious government departments con
ducting investigations.
This plan, it was stated today on
best authority, has the approval and
will get every ounce of support of
Democratic house and senate leaders.
Despite the fact that President Wil
son made no reference to it in his
message the high cost of living still
occupies the center of the congres
sional stage. Senators and congress
men are both being bombarded with
letters and telegrams urging action.
Congressman Fitzgerald, author of
the original embargo bill, has prac
tically a barrel full of commendatory
communications.
Senator Martine of New Jersey in
troduced in the senate a joint resolu
tion calling for embargo, "until such
time as normal prices shall prevail in
this country." The president is asked
to urge congressional action thru a
message. Representative Edmonds of
Pennsylvania introduced a resolution
in the house designed to hold prices
down by a modified embargo. By the
terms of the resolution the exporta
tion of grain and potatoes would be
prohibited when the prices for the
commodities reached a definite fixed
level.
Would Set Price Tevel.
Mr. Edmonds .would prevent expor
tation when oats reached 50 cents, rye
$1.25, wheat $1.50, corn $1.00, and
potatoes $1.25.
A resolution aimed at finding the
cause of inflated prices was introduced
in the house by Representative Van
Dyk of Minnesota. His resolution calls
for an investigation by the federal
trade commission and the departments
of commerce, agriculture and labor.
into all phases' of .the higher cost of
living, and the probable effect of pres
ent prices of laying an embargo.
The first actual investigation into
the high cost of lilng was authorized
when the house concurred in what
known as the Keating resolution. This
provides $6,000 for an inquiry to be
conducted by the department of labor
into prices in the District of Columbia.
Representative Keating of Colorado
introduced the bill the last session and
the senate amended it. The house ac
cepted the changes today, including
the striking out of a proposition to
investigate wages as well as prices.
Representative MUler of Minnesota
is working on a bill providing a time
limit for storing foods entering into
interstate commerce. Like some other
congressmen, he thinks this will check
speculators who store their goods until
the prices are "right. - He does not
believe in an embargo, declaring it
would work hardship to farmers.
DO WE GET MORE GAS?
Another Hitch Has Developed
Transfer of Kansas Natural.
in
Arter spending weeks in press
agenting the contemplated reduction
in gas rates, the public utilities com
mission now faces the probable ne
cessity of another gas rate hearing.
Information which has come to state
officials indicates a refusal on the
part of the Doherty interests to ob
serve the commission s ruling for
28-cent rate. Another conference has
been asked by the purchasers of the
Kansas rsatural Uas company prop
erty.
When the Dohertvs took over the
nansas ivatural, announcement was
made that 28-cent gas would be pro
vided. In fact the state commission
members had indicated that cheaper
gas wouia De offered on the motion
of the Dohertys as soon as a sale
agreement was approved. ' Every ef
fort was made by the commission
members to hasten the transfer. N ow
the Dohertys have balked. They have
asked for another conference and
state officials fear another, rate hear

MOTIVES FOR WAR
To See Belgium, Montenegro
and Serbia Restored.
Don't Want TVar With Greece,
Says Italy Premier.
Rome, Dee. 6. The allies do not
desire to force Greece into war nor
do they support any anti-dynasty
movement in Greece, asserted Premier
Boselli in his report on the war de
livered before the chamber of depu
ties today. Premier Boselli reiterated
the determination of Italy to maintain
war with her allies until the
restoration of Belgium, Serbia
and Montenegro was accomplished.
He termed this "The noble and essen
tial object of the war." At the close
of his speech he sent a message of
greeting to 'Our valorous Latin sis
ter, Rumania" trusting for her final
success. The premier's speech was
very long and in it he recapitulated
the whole history of Italy's participa
tion in the war and enumerated the
reasons which induced King Victor to
enter into the struggle. As a proof
that Italy was prepared to push her
operations vigorously, the premier an
nounced that here were now 2,100 fac
tories working on war material, the
workers being one-fifth women whose
participation both in industries and
agriculture was increasing daily.
The premier declared that victory
would insure the equilibrium on the
eastern Mediterranean which he
termed one of the chief foundations
of the Italian policy. He said that
Avolna would be Italy's strategic post
on the Adriatic from which would
radiate her future commercial expan
sion in the Balkans.
The speaker protested against the
dismemberment of Poland, which he
said, was confirmed by the action of
the central powers, against the depor
tation ft Belgians, the bombardment
of open towns .and the sinking of
steamers carrying peaceful and un
armed passengers.
After reviewing the work done in
the five months since the chamber ad
journed, the premier reiterated the
unshakable determination of Italy to
remain loyal to her allies and to em
ploy all her energies to ensure the ul
timate attainment of victory. '

BACK IN KANSAS
Stepben Losh and Miss Hupp
Get Big Reception.
Richland People Come to JJot
elty to See Their Act.
The roads from Richland this week
have been busy with conveyances
coming to Topeka, carrying people to
see Stephen Losh in the top-line act
at the Novelty this week. For all
Richland remembers Stephen Losh,
the boy who used to make the rounds
of the school sociables and county
fairs, astride of a big boned nag, with
his sleight of hand apparatus in his
pockets, a bag containing the per
sonages of a puppet under his arm
"ai ". a sheet around his neck which
he used in , the show for t make-up
room.
Stephen was the neighborhood en
tertainer of those times, his tricks of
magic and ventriloquism being wel
comed more heartily around Richland
than Eva Tanguay is welcomed in
New York.
- His narrative of "from the farm
to vaudeville' is absorbingly interest
ing. Iad Started Fever.
"My dad started the . fever in me
when a boy," he says. "He used to
tell me about the magicians, shows
and the circuses that 1 e had seen. I
was convinced at that time the tricks
were done by some spell or charm.
But one day I saw an advertisement
in a paper telling 'How to Lean Mag
ic "It got. my 75 cents by return mail.
In a day I could work all those tracks
and in a week I had improved on
them and invented new ones.
"Then Yankee Robinson's circus
came to town; The horses on our big
farm led a hard life after that. I
had them jumping .fences and run
ning chariot races.
"Frank Hardesty, who I understand
is in trouble now, was responsible for
my learning to ride.
"He used to say, Steve, I'll bet you
half a dollar that you can't ride that
horse standing up to that rail there,
let him pass under the rail and you
Jump over.' I won his half dollars,
and other neighbor's money on banters
and also did a little race riding.
Tho First Contract.
"I pestered my relatives to death to
get them to go into cahoots with me
in my stunts. I succeeded in develop
ing two. nephews and a brother into
pretty fair performers. Then my
niece, Alwilda Hupp, became interest
ed and we astonished the neighbors
by applying to Yankee Robinson's cir
cus and furthermore being accepted.
We stayed with them a year doing haTf
the things in the program, at the sal
ary of the least of the performers. We
were green grass from the country and
hadn't learned to be lazy yet. We quit
the circus after a year, on the advice
of a friend, urging us to go to New
York and try out for vaudeville.
"The whole neighborhood laughed
at us for fools when we announced
that we were setting out for - New
York. It was a joke they said for green
country folks to think they could go
on the stage. And besides I was leav
ing a good chance on my dad's farm.
"For some reason in New York they
sized us up as foreigners. And a Paris
theatrical agent there booked our act
immediately." t
Long Tour in Europe.
In the east Losh adopted little
"Goldie," 6 years old, and the daugh
ter of an over-large family of Swiss
acrobats. They took her to Paris with
them.
That was eighteen years ago They
fjlayed all the principal vaudeville
houses in France, and then went to
Germany. Booking succeeded book
ing and for years they played in every
country in Europe without losing a
day's work. They played only one
short engagement in that time in the
United States on a return from South
America. Then they went to Aus
tralia and while there the war broke
out, terminating the possibility of Eu
ropean engagements. Coming to San
Francisco from Australia they were
twice stopped by big, gray British war
vessels searching for German citizens.
For two years the trio have played
in all the eastern circuits. They want
ed to get back home to Kansas but
the Keith agents could not book them
that way. At Grand Rapids. Losh
wired his agent that he was sick and
disappeared. Then he hunted an
agency that could book his act in
Kansas.
Miss Hupp and Losh are happy.
Each morning and after the second
evening show they meet their old
childhood friends. And their long
residence in Europe has not changed
them a particle,, according to Richland
"The Three Goldinis," whom scores
the Novelty this week recognize as
Hupp of Richland.
people. And they still remember all
the details of their life there eighteen
years ago and insist that they will
return there when they retire. That
will be a long time off, however, lor
their "rug juggling" act is "going
big" everywhere shown.
