In the days when booze flowed without
limit any mother who appealed to a saloon
keeper not to sell liquor to her husband or son
got a laugh in the face from the proprietor, who
didn't have to consider the woe he wrought. It's
different now. At Fon du Lac, Wis., a court
has jnet awarded a wife a verdict of $3,600
gainst a liquor seller for ruining her husband
against her protest.
Under the terms of Irish independence the
people of the emerald sle must remain loyal
to the British king, yet they will have prac

corded to a republic. The government of Ire

Canada remains a British nation, a part of the
united kingdom's group, although the people
there run their own government and affairs.
Ireland in future, assuming that the present
program will be adopted, will do likewis.

Why the Farmer Can't Buy.
Burins the lt month, the federal reserve
board says in its review of business conditions,
improvement has not been so pronounced. "For
the time being." the board says, "the peak of
demand has been reached and passed."
" That is an eastern view. The west knows
that its own demand for goods can not get back
to normal until the prices of the things it
wants are more nearly in line with the prices
' othe things it has to sell. A farmer last year
could buy a pair of shoes with two bushels of
com. Today it will take ten bushels Last
year after buying the shoes he had eight bush
els of corn left over with which. to purchase
other things. This year he uses up all ten
bushels of corn on the shoes and he must go
without the things he was able to buy when
the corn was worth more.
The farm purchasing power represents
nearly half the purchasing power of the coun
try. So long as it is cut to pieces industries
most run part time and men must be out of
work because the fanner cannot buy. There
is no present hope of any. great advance in farm
prices. These are eet in world markets. Re
lief will come only through the balancing of industry-
by the lowering of prices of transpor
tation and the other things the farmer must
bay. How these prices are to be brought down
is a question that ought to receive careful at
tention from every business man and worker.
For until they get down and the purchasing
power of the farmer is restored there is bound
to be depression, with unemployment and bad
living conditions. ,
The President's Message.
President Harding, in his message deliv
ered to congress yesterday, charts a sound
cource to follow to bring the nation back to
normalcy. In showing that our first duty is to
save ourselves, -he but cities the first law of
nature, although he would not have us be un
responsive to the appeals from other parts of
the world where there Is suffering and where
we are able to offer relief.
But the president In a comprehensive grasp
Pt Xtt entire situation. Impresses the people
with the thought that there most be a read
justment all along the line and that it can be
accomplished only hrongh the cooperation of
all of the elements of industry and society.
For several years America has-been con
cerned With the woes of other nations, and
while weJiave been seeking to straighten out
the difficulties of our neighbors our own affairs
have gotten sadly out of joint. That's the
plain truth of the matter. The cities are over
crowded, war (obs having attracted hundreds
of thousands of young people from the agricul
tural sections to the cities. The majority of
these jpung people are still in the cities, many
of them jobless. There are places for them
back on the farms, and they must go there.
Eventually they will, but In the meantime there
is a problem to meet.
The country Is as rich and productive as It.
ever was. There Is work for everybody. . There
Is market for our pod acts of the farm and the
mill and factory, there is a good living for
everybody wishing to work for his living. All
vthat is necessary to bring about the happy con
ditions that prevailed before the recent world
d its trr bance Is for everyone to get back where
he belongs. Most of ns are out of our regular
grooves.
The president offers excellent recommen
dations to congress in the form of helpfuflegis
lation, and It is hoped that the body will see
fhe wisdom of his counsel. Especially helpful
will be tariff enactments to meet changing con
ditions and laws that will prevent disturbances
between capital and labor than have heretofore
been so disastrous to the country. The presi-'
dent rightfully lakes the position that labor
should be permitted to organize as well as cap
ital, but, too, he maintains there should "fte a
tribunal with the power to compel agreements
betwen employer and employe when they are
unable between themselves to reach understandings.
Better Home Life.
Speakers at the state welfare conference,
being held this week in Peoria, have empha
sized the importance of good home life. "If
the home life of Americans were better," said
one speaker, "ourork would be correspond
ingly less. Communities which pay attention
to improving the homes are always the com
munities which have the best spirit and the best
citizens." .
America will learn some time what the best
people have known all the time that the home
life must be brightened, that the home must be
more attractive than the places which are now
drawing so many yonng people, that discipline
must start in the home, and that home training
is reflected in the attitude and actions of per
sons when they are out in the world.
A welfare worker recently took the time to
make investigations of the early life of some
men who have just started penitentiary sen
tences. One man, less than 35 years when he
was sent up for burglary, was never held in
check by his parents when he was young and
at the age of eight years could not be handled
by his father. A man who had been sentenced
on a criminal charge reported voluntarily that
his father knew that he had robbed a corner
grocery when the son was about twelve years
old, but that he never as much as reprimanded
him. A hi-Jacker who is now serving time
"ran his home" when he was 14 years old, ac
cording to members of his own family, and
confessed that in all his life his parents never
tried to keep him from going wrong.
The home is the center of character in thi3
or any other country. It is also the place where
industry and initiative, and common sense, and
humanitarianism, and charity and respect for
others are taught. The speakers at the Peoria,
conference are doing a good service in empha
sizing these facts, and as soon as Americans
generally learn this they will start on another
grade toward improved character and better
general conditions.

What these physical defects should
be ignored in the schoolroom.
The hump backed seats in many
school rooms predispose the chll-
! dren to round shoulders, . fiat
chests, ptosis and genera! atony.
Many school boards order seats
without sufficient regard for the
physical welfare of the children.
They never think of seeking med
ical counsel as to the form and
construction of the seats. And
consequently one finds a hollow in
the seat right where there should
be a supporting prominence, in the
small of the back; and a promi
nence where there should be a
hollow, behind the shoulders. And
instead of adjusting the seat to the
stature of the- child, some school
boards prefer to adjust the child
to the peculiar huild of the seat.

The "Catarrh" Delusion Still Going1
Strong.
Is there any good remedy . you
can suggest catarrh can be perma
nently cured by? Is there any pre
scription that will drive catarrh
completely out of the system, and
cure catarrhal deafness? (G. W.
B.) 1
Answer There is no such thing
as catarrh in the system, friend.
"Catarrh" is not a condition or
s"tato of disease or entity; it is
simply a, blanket title for all sorts
of nose and throat diseases, a title
applied when the teal nature of
the disease has not been corractly
diagnosed. Of course, no prescrip
tion or remedy or treatment would
be appropriate for all the diseases
so confused. Visit your doetof and
have him examine the nose and
throat, or if he does not do such
work he can refer you to a nose
and throat specialist for a diag
nosis qf your trouble.

naval and military strength over
the others, Is now apparent to all
who have closely followed the pro
ceedings. Furthermore, it Is no surprise to
those who understood the nature
of the gatherings. No nation is
going-to disarm as long as the
causes of international war re
main unchanged, for the simple
reason that they are bound to
cause war again. A certain saving
in taxes is the most that can be
expected from the disarmament
phase of the conference. Its con
sideration of the far eastern ques
tion, on the other hand, may be re
garded as the nearest thing to a
sincere attempt which modern di
plomacy has ever made to remove
canses of war. Whether the at-
tempt will have any success at all
remains doubtful:-
France is coming in for a great
fusal to reduce her standing army,
which she asserts she needs to pro
tect her against Germany and Rus
sia. It has been pointed out re
peatedly that both of those nations
are incapacitated for an indefinite
length of time. France is accused
of employing sophistries to estab
lish her right to a' large army.
So, it appears, she is, and so are
all the other nations. Her stand
ing army is all France has. She
possesses no strength on the sea,
where she ia outclassed by three
other powers England, the United
States and Japan. Eaeh of those
nations is trying to get out of the
disarmament conference some ad
vantage in naval armament. Japan
stands out resolutely for a ratio
that will leave her relatively
stronger than she was before the
conference. She brings forward
the sophistry that, he peculiar po
sition makes necessary this extra
strength.
The Submarine Question.
England stands out for reducing
the submarine to the lowest possi
ble status. Hemmed in on her lit
tle island, Great Britain is more
menaced by the submarine than by
anything alse. It nearly starved
her during the war. It is capable
of making the transportation of
food and material from her colonies
almost impossible. On the other
hand, it is not important to the de
fense of her short insular past
line. Hence, large submarine flo
tillas and the development of the
submarine are the greatest men
aces to great Britain. She is in:
favor of almost abolishing snbrna-

Cannon in the Parks.
The president of the Cook county board op
posed a proposal for the decoration of Chicago
parks with captured German cannon.Niut there
was such a fervid protest from the American
legion and other interested citizens that the
verdict was speedily revereeed. Forty-two
centimeter howitzers and specimens of the
famous minnen-werfer are to serve as com
panion pieces for Taft's and St. Gauden's noble
works of sculptural art. If the public's taste
for park furnishing can be appeased only by
the permanent exhibition of obsolete artillery,
the public should be given the artillery. It pays
tha bills for the maintenance of the parks and
the parks exist for its pleasure and recrea
tion. It is interesting none the less to examine
this peculiar passion for park armament, and
especially the explanation of .it, as advanced
by Chicago officials of the legion.
The artillery, it is contended, will serve as
a preventive of a future conflict like the one
from which we recently emerged. The reas
oning is delightfully fresh. It answers not
only as a guide for the future, but provides
for the first time, an explanation of a policy
adhered to in the past. Heretofore no one has
seemed able to say just what practical end was
served by the placing of Civil war cannon in
our parks and court house squares. Now that
it appears that the aim was not merely deco
rative, there will be an universal experience of
relief. Understanding of the purpose does not
necessarily imply, however, an unexceptional
approval of the means. Skepticism is encour
aged by the unanswered question of how it was
possible' for the people of this nation, with the
grim reminders of the Civil war cannon before
them, to go Into the Spanish war, apd then the
World war, with every appearance of unani
mity. It must be granted that this method of
exorcising war has not always worked. Ger
many itself, it may be recalled, by this stand
ard 6houId have been the most pea'ce-inclined
nation on earth. There was a mam en to of
some early war in every German city square.
It is just possible, of course, that emphasis
upon these failures of the token Is an Injustice
to its average success. If the pre ent genera-i
tion of Americans had not been reared in the 1
night of the silent muzzles of the Civil war
artillery perhaps we should have been involved
long since in wars with every people on the
globe. Perhaps it was , only the equestrian

left behind the check for $30u which
her father had deposited stealthily
on her dresser.
With the change she had on hand.
Betty started out for the nearest
city, head held high and courage in
her heart. Two week later, as she
sat in her stuffy little room, her
courage had evaporated, her heart
(she thought) was broken, but her
pride still held. Sixty-seven cents
and her landlady bad ordered her
out of the house with one week's
rent unpaid. For Betty had not yet

game of bluff. After all, she was
only a child.
She did not know how to get

did not know why Mrs. Gammage
eyed those same rings and her

His batv girl out in that desert
of howling wolves!
As a last resort he had come to
the little city nearest home (for he
felt sure that Betty would feel the
lure of distance) and he had spent
two days tracing Betty to Mrs
Gammage's rooming house. That
evening he had snid things terri
ble things to Mrs. Gammage
which that worthy was never to
forget. Then he hunted the streets,
the lodging houses, the hospitals,
the morgue, hour by hour, aided by
a corps of detectives.
By 1 o'clock, Betty had fallen
into an uneasy dose. Her handbag
dropped to tho pebbled walk with a
thud. A furtive shadow slipped
nearer, grinned wolfishly as he laid
a possessive hand upon Betty's arm.
The breath of the Beast fanned the
girl's white, terror-stricken face.
No escape? Tha kindly gleams of
searchlights darted through the
park and
"Oaddy!" One choked cry.
The Beast, snarling viciously,
slunk into the shrubbery. But tho
shadow of Fear never quite left the
soul of Betty. -
The United States is not so im-
selfish interest, but she came our
of it with the financial mastery of
the world in her left pants pocket.
What Benefits by Yictorj!
Vet how this financial mastery
of the worfd has benefited the mail
who works for wages or a salary in
this, country, it s hard to discover.
He either fought or paid for that
mastery, but if called upon to pro
duce his' share of the benefit h?
would have a hard time doing it.
So it always is. The common
man never shares in the material
benefits of a mar, except in a tem
porary and accidental way. Thost
go to a few financiers. What tie
common man gets is the fua of
fighting-and paying tases and the
emotional exaltation of engaging in
a great patriotic enterprise.
That these things are worth
something to him is evident from
the amount he pays for them. It ia
futile to pretend that war has no
appeal to the common max If it
didn't have, there wouldn't be any
war. The common man's life is
apt to be a monotonous, restricted
affair. War may suudtn'v make it
exciting, intense. War brings to a
people an enormous amount of ex
citement, of the joy of primiure
impulse unleashed, and of a great
emotional debanch. It can scarce
ly be disputed that there is some
human need which war satisfies.
Modern international war is the
spectacle of certain intsrested par
ties working to satisfy that need
and in so doing to promote certain
profitable purposes of their own.
The flaw in the system is that
ever since the middle ages war has
been becoming less and less satis
factory to the common man as a
means of satisfying his craving tor
combat, adventure and emotional
explosion. In the middle ages wai
was a sort of creat free-for-all
pressed with this horror. Silbina- i fight in which men engaged in cast
AMERICANS IN
ARMENIA TAKE
CAKE OF WAIFS
Alexandropol, Armenian Soviet
Republic. Two Americans have be
come fathers by adoption of 17,003
homeless Armenian orpcans in this
far-off city. Milton D. Brown of
Hdalden, Mass., and William Martin
of New York have adopted the
waifs on behalf of the American
Near East relief committee. The
young men,, who have been carry
ing on relief work in Armenia for
many months, plan to take some of
the children of America and to
have them educated in American
schools.
In a report to his organization
at Constantinople, Brown declares
that Armenia faces the worst win
ter within its history. He says
famine prevails everywhere and
that there is a serious shortage of
wood and fuel. He declares that
up to now the bolsheviki have tak
en good case of the Armenians, but
that their resources are running'
low and the Armenians must turn
to others for aid.
h Brown says that peace and order
prevail throughout Armenia; and
that the soviet government un
doubtedly saved the country. It is
protecting the Armenian popula
tion from the aggressions of their
ancient" masters, the Turks, and
the people are allowed to pursue
their chosen callings unmolested.
Unharassed by war, the people ap
pear to be more content than at
any time in recent history. For
more than a year now the popula
tion has been spared massacres at
the hands of the Turks,' and tha
country appears to have entered
upon a new era of peace and, quiet.

rines are extremely useful on the
defense of a long coast line like
ours. We are in favor of rather a
large supply of submarines. Fur
thermore, the genuineness of our
desire to disarm was put to the
test, it seems, when poison gas was
mentioned. It was suggested that
poison gas be eliminated altogether
from international warfare, as the
most horrible weapon of all, and
the American delegates demurred.
It is said that our war department
has the formula for ttie most de
structive gas on earth, and that in
the next war it will be our strong
est asset. Are we going to throw
it away? We should say not.
All of this Is no criticism of any
one. It is merely a statement of
the inevitable. No nation is going
to disarm as long as- the world is
full of things and situations that
are capable of causing internation
al wars. Disarmament will be pos
sible when cause for international
war has been abolished everywhere
as completely, for exanple, as
cause fon war between the United
States and Canada has been abol
ished. And these causes for inter
national war will be abolished
when the common man refuses to
fight, and pay taxes.
A good man' common men in tha
world are in revolt against blood
ejLed and taxes now. That is the
iron banged at each other wita
long sticks. Nearly everybody hl
a good time and not so many were
killed. A war could, and did, go
on for a hundred years without do
ing any 'great harm. And then
there were tho Crusades. Who
wouldn't like to go on a junket
slch as those?
Then came the great aje of dis
covery and colonization. Here again
war became a delightful adventure.
From Cortez's subjugation of Mex
ico down to Custer's last stand, the
conquest of the American wilder
ness was an heroic adventure tlmt
rivalled the Odyssey.
Those wars had appeal to the im
agination, they gave the common
man a real thrill, and they did not
exhaust nations or peoples.
Modern war is an adventure for
comparatively few and a hard,
miserable affair for many, and it
does exhaust both nations and
peoples. It even sometime de
