Washington, Dec. 3. The following- la
the full text of President Roosevelt's
message to the second session of the
Fifty-ninth congress:
To the Senate and House of Represen
tatives: As a nation we still continue to
enjoy a literally unprecedented prosper
ity; and it Is probable that only reckless
speculation and disregard of legitimate
business methods on the part of the
business world can materially mar this
prosperity.
No congress In our time has done more
good work of Importance than the pres
ent congress. There were several mat
ters left unfinished at your last session,
however, which I most earnestly hope
you will complete before your adjourn
ment. I again recommend a law prohibiting
all corporations from contributing to the
campaign expenses of any party. Such
a bill has already past one house of con
gress. Let individuals contribute as they
desire; but let us prohibit In effective
fashion all corporations from making
contributions for any political purpose,
directly or Indirectly.
Another bill which has just past one
house of the congress and which Is ur
gently necessary should be enacted into
law is that conferring upon the govern
ment the right of uppeal in criminal
eases on questions of law. This right
exists in many of the states; it exists in
the District of Columbia by act of the
congress. It is of course not proposed
that in any case a verdict for the de
fendant on the merits should be set
aside. Recently in one district wnere
the government had Indicted certain per
sons for conspiracy In connection with
rebates, the court sustained the defend
ant's demurrer: while in another juris
diction an indictment for conspiracy to
obtain rebates has been sustained by
,u. .... v. ... t 1 , .i .. it
the court, convictions obtained vnder It
and two defendants sentenced to impris
onment. The two cases referred to may
not be in real conflict with each other,
but it is unfortunate that there should
even be an apparent conflict. At pres
ent there Is no way by which the gov
ernment can cause such a conflict, when
it occurs, to be solved by an appeal to
a higher court; and the wheels of justice
are blocked without any real decision of
the question. I can not too strongly
urge the passage of the bill in question.
A failure to pass will result Id seriously
President Roosevelt.
hampering the government In Its effort
to obtain Justice, especially against
wealthy individuals or corporations who
do wrong; and may also prevent the
government from obtaining Justice for
wageworkers who are not themselves
able effectively to contest a case where
the judgment of an Inferior court has
been against them. I have specifically
,'n view a recent decision by a district
jcdoe leaving railway employees with
out remedy for violation of a certain so
called labor statute. It seems an absurd
ity to permit a single district Judge,
against what may be the Judgment of
the Immense majority of his colleagues
on the bench, to declare a law solemnly
enacted by the congress to be "uncon
stitutional," and then to deny to the
government the right to' have the su
preme court definitely decide the ques
tion. frlmlnnl Prosecutions.
It is well to recollect that the real
efficiency of the law often depends not
upon the passage of acts as to which
there is great public excitement, but
upon the passage of acts of this nature
as to which there Is not much public
excitement, because there is little pub
lic understanding of their importance,
while the Interested parties are keenly
alive to the desirability of defeating
them The Importance of enacting into
law the particular bill in question is
further increased by the fact that the
government has now definitely begun a
pollcv of resorting to the criminal law
In those trust and Interstate commerce
cases where such a course offers a rea
sonable chance of success. At first, as
was proper, every effort was made to en
force these laws by civil proceedings;
but it has become Increasingly evident
the' the action of the government In
finally deciding, in certain cases, to un
dertake criminal proceedings was Justifiable-
and tho there have been some
conspicuous failures In these cases, we
have had many successes, which have
undoubtedly had a deterrent effect upon
evil-doers, whether the penalty inflictd
was in the shape of fine or Impriion
ment and penalties of both kinds have
already been inflicted by the courts. Of
course, where the judge can see his
way to inflict the penalty of imprison
ment the deterrent eft-ci of the punish
ment on other offenders is increased:
but sufficiently heavy fines accomplish
much. Judga Molt, or me nw ior
district court, in a recent decision admir
ably stated the need fpr treating with
Just severity offenders of this kind. Hti
opinion runs In part as follows:
"The government's evidence to estab
lish the defendant's guilt was clear,
conclusive and undisputed. The case was
a flagrant one. The transactions which
took place under this illegal contract
were very large; the amounts of rebatei
"turned ere considerable; and the
amount of the rebate itaelf was large
amounting to more than one-fifth of the
entire tariff charge for the transporta
tion of merchandise from this city tc
Detroit. It is not too much to say, ir
my opinion, that If this business wai
carried on for a considerable Urn oi
ANNUAL
TO CONGRESS
that basis that Is, If this discrimination
In favor of this particular shipper was
made with an IS instead of a 23 cent
rate and the tariff rate was maintained
as against their competitors the re
sult might be and not Improbably would
be that their competitors would be driven
out of business. This crime is one which
in Its nature Is deliberate and premedi
tated. I think over a fortnight elapsed
between the date of Palmer's letter re
questing the reduced rate and the answer
of the railroad company deciding to
grant it, and then for months after
wards this business was carried on and
these claims for rebates submitted month
after month and checks in payment of
them drawn month after month. Such
a violation of the law, in my opinion, in
its essential nature, is a very much
more heinous act than the ordinary
common, vulgar crimes which come be
fore criminal courts constantly for pun
ishment and which arise from sudden
passion or temptation. This crime In
this case was committed by men of
education and of large business experi
ence, whose business standing in the
community was such that they might
have been expected to set an example
of obedience to law, upon the main
tenance of which alone In this country
the security of their property depends.
It was committed on behalf of a great
railroad corporation, which, like other I
railroad corporations, has received gra
tuitously from the static large and valu
able privileges for the public's conven
ience and Its own, which performs quasi
public functions and which is charged
with the highest obligation in the trans
action of Its business to treat the citizens
of this country alike, and r jC to carry on
its business with unjust c'iscrlminatlons
between different citizens or different
classes of citizens. This crime In Its
nature Is one usually done with secrecy,
and proof of which It Is very difficult
to obtain. The interstate commerce act
was passed in 1887, nearly 20 years ago.
Ever since that time complaints of the
n ... . i... Uoc I ......
granting of rebates by railroads has been
common, urgent, insistent, and altho
the congress has repeatedly past legis
lation endeavoring to put a stop to this
evil, the difficulties of obtaining proof
upon which to bring prosecution in these
cases is so great that this is the first
case that has ever been brought in this
court, and, as I am informed, this case
and one recently brought In Philadelphia
aVe the only cases that have ever been
brought in the eastern part of this coun
try. In fact, but few cases of this kind
have ever been brought In this country,
east or west. Now, under these circum
stances, 1 am forced to the conclusion,
In a case in which the proof is so clear
and the facts are so flagrant, It is the
duty of the court to fix a penalty which
shall In some degree be commensurate
with the gravity of the offense. As be
tween the two defendants, In my opinion,
the principal penalty should be imposed
on the corporation. The traffic manager
in this case, presumably, acted wlthqut
any advantage to himself and without
any Interest in the transaction, either
by the direct authority or in accordance
with what he understood to be the policy
or the wishes of his employer.
"The sentence of this court In this case
Is, that the defendant Pomeroy, for each
I of the six offenses upon which he has
! been convicted, be fined the sum of $1,000.
making six fines, amounting in all to the
sum of $6,0X); and the defendant. The
New York Central & Hudson River Rail
road company, for each of the six crimes
of which it has been convicted, be fined
the sum of $15,000, making six fines
amounting In the aggregate to the sum
of $108,000, and Judgment to that effect
will be entered In this case."
Evasion by Technicalities.
In connection with this matter, I would
like to call attention to the very unsat
isfactory state of our criminal law, re
sulting in large part from the habit of
setting aside the judgments of inferior
courts on technicalities absolutely un
connected with the merits of the case,
and where there Is no attempt to show
that there has been any failure of sub
stantial justice. It would be well to en
act a law providing something to the
effect that:
No judgment shall be set aside or new
trial granted in any cause, civil or crim
inal, on the ground of misdirection of the
jury or the Improper admission or re
jection of evidence, or for error as to any
matter of pleading or procedure unless.
In the opinion of the court to which the
application Is made, after an examina
tion of the entire cause, it shall affirma
tively appear that the error complained
oi has resulted in a miscarriage g
justice.
Injunctions.
In my last message I suggested the en
actment of a law in connection with the
issuance of injunctions, attention hav
ing been sharply drawn to the matter
by the demand that the light of apply
ing Injunctions in labor cases should be
wholly abolished. It is at least doubtful
whether a law abolishing altogether the
use of tnjunct' ns In such cases would
stand the test of the courts; in which
case of course the legislation would be
ineffective. Moreover, 1 believe it would
be wrong altogether to prohibit the use
of injunctions. It is criminal to permit
sympathy with criminals to weaken our
hands In upholding the law; and If men
seek to destroy life or property by mob
violence there should be no Impairment
of the power of the courts to deal with
them In the roost summary and effective
wav possible. But so far as possible the
abuse of the power should be provided
against by some such law as I advocated
last year.
In this matter.,of injunctions there is
lodged in the hands of the Judiciary a
necessary power which is nevertheless
subject to the possibility of grave abuse.
It la a power that should be exercised
with extreme care and should be sub
ject to the jealous scrutiny of all men,
and condemnation should be meted out
as much to the judge who fails to use
it boldly when necessary as to the judge
who uses it wantonly or oppressively.
I Of course, a Judge strong enough to be
: fit for his office will enjoin any resort
1 to violence or Intimidation, especially by
conspiracy, no matter what hla opinion
. may be of the rights of the original quar
I rel. There nust be no hesitation in
: dealing with disorder. But there mast
1 likewise be no such abuse of the tn-
Junctive power as is Implied in forbidding
lauonng I.-aou w tiic wito vwi uri-

nor must the Injunction be used merely

Criticism of the Judiciary.
It may be the highest duly of a judge
at any given moment to disregard, not
merely the wishes of Individuals of
great political or financial power, but
the 'overwhelming tide of public senti
ment, and the judge who does thus dis
regard public sentiment when it is wrong,
who brushes aside the plea of any spe
cial Interest when the pleading is not
founded on righteousness, performs the
highest service to the country. Such a
Judge Is deserving of all honor; and all
honor cannot be paid to this wise and
fearless Judge if we permit the growth
of an absurd convention which would
forbid any criticism of the Judge of an
other type, who shows himself timid In
the presence of arrogant disorder, or
who on Insufficient grounds grants-an In
junction that does grave Injustice, or
who in his capacity as a construer, and
therefore in part a maker of the law,
In flagrant fashion thwarts the cause of
decent government. The Judge has a
power over which no review can be exer
cised; he hltnself sits In review upon the
acts of both the executive and legisla
tive branches of the government; save
in the most extraordinary cases he Is
amenable only at the bar of public opin
ion; and it Is unwise to maintain that
public opinion In reference to a man
with such power shall neither be exprest
nor led.
The best Judges have ever been fore
most to disclaim any Immunity from
criticism. This has been true since the
days of the great English Lord Chancel
lor Parker, who said: "Let all people
be at liberty to know what I found my
Judgment upon; that, so when 1 have
given it In any cause, others may be at
liberty to Judge of me." The proprieties
of the case were set forth with singular
clearness and good temper bv Judge VV.
H. Taft. when a Unltec; States circuit
Judge. 11 years ago, In 189.'' ;
"The opportunity freely and publicly
to criticize Judicial action is of vastly
more Importance to the body politic than
ine immunity or courts ana Judges rrom
unjust aspersions and attack. Nothing
tends more to render Judges careful In
their decisions and anxiously solicitous
to do exact Justice than the conscious
ness that every act of theirs is to be
subjected to the intelligent icrutinv and
candid criticism of their fellow-men.
Such criticism is beneficial in proportion
as It Is fair, dispassionate, discriminating
and based on a knowledge of sound legal
principles. The comments made by
learned text writers and by the acute
editors of the various law reviews upon
judicial decisions are therefore highly
useful. Such critics constitute more or
less Impartial tribunals of professional
opinion before which each judgment Is
made to stand or fall on Its merits, and
thus exert a strong influence o secure
uniformity of decision. But non-professional
criticism also Is by no meanr
without Its urea, even if accompanied, as
it often Is, by a direct attack upon the
Judicial fairness and motives of the occu
pants of the bench; for If the law is but
the essence of common sense, the pro
test of mapy average men may evidence
a defect in a Judicial conclusion, tho
based on tho nicest legal reasoning and
profoundest learning. The two important
elements of moral character In a judge
are an earnest desire to reach a Just
conclusion and courage to enforce It. In
sofar as fear of public comment does not
affect the courage of a judge, but only
spurs him on to search his conslcence
and to reach the result which approves
itself to his Inmost heart, such comment
serves a useful purpose. There are few
men, whether they are Judges for life
or for a shorter term, who do not prefer
earn and hold the respect of all, and who
cannot be reached and made to pause
and deliberate by hostile public criticism.
In the of judges having a life tenure
Indeed, their very Independence makes
the right freely to comment on their
decisions of greater Importance, because
it Is the only practical and available in
strument in the hands of a free people
to keep such judges alive to the reason
able demands of those they serve.
"On the other hand, the danger of de
stroying the proper Influence of Judicial
decisions by creating unfounded preju
dices against the courts justifies and re
quires that unjust attacks shall be met
and answered. Courts must ultimately
rest their defense upon the Inherent
strength of the opinions they deliver as
the ground for their conclusions and
must trust to the calm and deliberate
Judgment of all the people aa their best
vindication."
Sound Judgment of the People.
There Is one consideration which should
be taken into account by . the good people
who carry a sound proposition to an ex
cess in oojecting to any criticism of a
judge's decision. Ine Instinct of the
American people as a whole Is sound In
this matter. They will not subscribe to
the doctrine that any public servant Is
to be above criticism, if the best citi
zens, those most competent to express
their Judgment in such matters, and
above all those belonging to the great
and honorable profession of the bar,
so profoundly influential In American
life, take the position that there shall be
no criticism of a judge under any cir
cumstances, their view will not be ac
cepted by the American people as a
whole. In such event the people will
turn to, and tend to accept as justifiable,
the Intemperate and improper criticism
uttred by unworthy agitators. Surely.,
It Is a misfortune to leave to such crit
ics a function, right in itself, which they
are certain to abuse. Just and temperate
criticism, when necessary, hi a safeguard
against the acceptance by the people
as a whole of that intemperate antag
onism towards the judiciary which must
be combated by every right-thinking
man, and which, if It become widespread
among the people at large, would consti
tute a dire menace to the republic.
THE NEGRO PROBLEM.
President Says Mob Lair la a Menace
to the Country.
In connection with the delays of the
law, I call your attention and the atten
tion of the nation to the prevalence of
crime among us, and above all to the
epidemic of lynching and mob violence
that springs up, now In one part of our
country, now In another. Each section,
north, south, east or west, has its own
faults; no section can with wisdom spend
Its time jeering at the faults ?t another
section; it should bo busy try:r
'.mend Its own saortcomlngs. To deal
w,h the crime of corruption It Is neces
sary to have an awakened public con
science, and to supplement this by
whatever legislation will add speed and
certainty in the execution of the law.
When we deal with lynching even more
la necessary. A great many white men
are lynched, but the crime la peculiarly
frequent In respect to black men. The
greatest existing cause of lynching is the
perpetration, especially by black men,
of the hideous crime of rape the most
abominable in all the category of crimes,
vtn worse than murder. Mobs frequent
ly avenge the commission of this crime
by themselves torturing to death the
man committing it; thus avenging In
bestial fashion a bestial dead, and reduc
ing themselves to a level with the crim
inal. Lawlessness grows by what it feeds
upon: and when mobs begin to lynch
for rape they speedily extend the
sphere of their operations and lynch
for many other kinds of crimes, so
that two-thirds of the lynchlngs are
mot for rape at all; while a considera
ble proportion of the individuals
lynched are innocent of all
crime. Gov. Candler, of Georgia, stat
ed on one occasion some years ago: "I
can say of a verity that I have, within
the last month, saved tha lives of half
a dosen innocent negroes who were
pursued by the reob, and brought them
to trial in a court of law in which
they were acquitted." As Bishop Gal
loway, of Mississippi, has finely said:
"When the rule of a mob obtains, that
which distinguishes a hlarh civilization
is surrendered. The mob which lynch -J

In such fashion that it seems us if not

ing. There Is but one safe rule In
dealing with black men as with white
men; It is the same rule that must be
applied In dealing with rich men and
poor men, that Is. to treat each man.
whatever his color, his creed, or his
social position, with even-handed Jus
tice on his real -worth as a man White
people owe It quite as much to them
selves as to the colored race to treat
well the colored man who shows hy
his life that he deserves such treat
ment: for It Is surely the highest wis
dom to encourage in the colored race
all those Individuals who are honest.
Industrious. law-abiding. and who
therefore make good and safe neigh
bors and citizens. Reward or punish
the Individual on his merits as an In
dividual. Evil will surely come In
the end to both races If we substitute
for this Just rule the habit of treating
all the members of the race, good and
bad. alike. There Is no question of
"social equality' or "negro domination"
Involved: only the question of relent
lessly punishing bad men, and of se
curing to the good man tho right to
his life, his liberty, and the nursult
of his happiness as his own qualities
of heart, head and hand enable him to
achieve it.
Every colored man should realize
that the worst enemy of his race Is the
negro criminal, and above all the ne
gro criminal who commits the dread
ful crime of rape: and It should be felt
as In the highest degree an offense
against the whole country, and against
the colored race In particular, for a
colored man to fall to help the officers
of the law In hunting down with all
possible earnestness and zeal every
such Infamous offender. Moreover, In
my Judgment, the crime of rape should
always be punished with death, as is
the case with murder; atsault with In
tent to commit rape should be made a
capital crime, at least in the discretion
of the court; and provision should be
made by which the punishment may
follow Immediately upon the heels of
the offense: while the trial should be
so conducted that the victim need not
be wantonly shamed while giving tes
timony, and that the least possible
publicity shall be given to the details.
The members of the white race on
the other hand should understand that
every lynching represents by just so
much a loosening of the bands of civ
ilization; that the spirit of lynching
inevitably throws Into prominence In
the community all the foul and evil
creatures who dwell therein. No man
can take part in the torture of a hu
man being without having his own
moral nature permanently lowered.
Every lynching means Just so much
moral deterioration in all the children
who have any knowledge of It. and
therefore Just so much additional
trouble for the next generation of
Americans.
Let justice be both sure and swift;
but let It be Justice under the law.
and not the wild and crooked savagery
of a mob.
Need for Negro Education.
There Is another matter which has
a direct bearing upon this matter of
lynching arre of the brutal crime which
sometimes calls It forth and at other
times merely furnishes the excuse for
its existence. It is out of the question
for our people ss a whole permanently
to rise by treading down any of their
own number. Even those who them
selves for the moment profit by such
maltreatment of their fellows will In
the long run also suffer. No more
shortsighted policy can be imagined
than. In the fancied Interest of one
class, to prevent the education of an
other class. The free public school, the
chance for each boy or girl to get a
f ood elementary education, lies at the
oundatlon of our whole political situ
ation, in every community the poor
est citizens, those who need the schools
most, would be deprived of them if
they only received school facilities
proportionately to the taxes they paid.
This Is as true of one portion of our
country as of another. It is as true
for the negro as for the white man.
The white man, if he is wise, will de
cline to allow the negroes In a mass to
grow to manhood and womanhood
without education. Unquestionably ed
ucation such as Is obtained In our pub
lic schools does not do everything to
wards making a man a good citizen;
but it does much. The lowest and most
brutal criminals, those for instance
who commit the crime of rape, are In
the great majority men who have had
either no education or very lltle; Just
as they are almost Invariably men who
own no property; for the man who
puts money by out of his earnings,
like the man who acquires education,
is usually lifted above mere brutal
criminality. Of course the best type
ox euucauun ior tne coioreo man. ta
ken as a whole, is such education as
is conferred In schools like Hampton
and Tuskegee; where the boys and
girls, the young men and young co
men, are trained Industrially as well
as in the ordinary public school
branches. The graduates of these
schools turn out well In the great ma
jority of cases, and hardly any of them
become criminals, while what little
criminality there Is never takea the
form of that brutal violence which In
vites lynch law. Every graduate of
these schools and for the matter of
that every oher colored man or wo
man who leads a life so useful and
honorable aa to win the good will and
respect of those whites whose neigh
bor he or she is, thereby helps the
whole colored race as it can be helped
in no other way; for next to the negro
himself, the man who can do most to
help the negro Is his white neighbor
who lives near him; and our steady
effort should be to fcetter the relations
between the two. Great tho the bene
fit of these schools has been to their
colored pupils and to the colored peo
ple. It may well be questioned whether
the benefit has not been at least aa
great to the white people among whom
these colored pupils live after they
graduate.
Exciting Mob Vengeance.

but also tend by what criminologists I

the likelihood of a repetition of the I
very crime against which they are in-
velghlng. When the mob is composed
of the people of one race and the man
lynched is ot anotner race, the men
who In their speeches snd writings
either excite or Justify the action tend,
of course, to excite a bitter race feel

CAPITAL AND LABOR.
The Preachlnsr nf Class Distinction Is
severely Condemned.
In dealing with both labor and capi
tal, with the questions affecting both
corporations and trade unions, there
is one matter more Important to re
member than aught else, and that Is
the infinite harm done by preachers of
mere discontent. These are the men
who seek to excite a violent class
hatred against all men of wealth.
They seek to turn wise and proper
movements for the better control of
corporations and for doing away with
the abuses connected with wealth, into
a campaign of hysterical excitement
and falsehood In which the aim is to
inflame to madness the brutal passions
of mankind. The sinister demagogs
and foolish visionaries who are always
eager to undertake such a campaign of
destruction sometimes seek to associ
ate themselves with those working for
a genuine reform In governmental and
social methods, and sometimes mas
querade as such reformers. In reality
they are the worst enemies of the
cause they profess to advocate, Just as
the purveyors of sensational slander
In newspaper and magazine are the
worst enemies of all men who are en
gaged In an honest effort to better
what Is bad In our social and govern
mental conditions. To preach hatred
of the rich man as such, to carry on a
campaign of slander and Invective
against him. to Meek to mislead and
InflHmM to madness honest men whose
lives are hard and who have not the
kind of mental training which will
permit them to appreciate the danger
In the rtoctrlnes preached all mis is
to commit a crime against the body
politic and to be false to every worthy
principle and tradition of American
national life. Moreover, while such
preaching and such agitation may give
a livelihood and a certain notoriety to
some of those who take part in it. and
may result in temporary political
success of others. In the long run every
such movement will either fail or else
will provoke a violent reaction, which
will Itself result not merely In undoing
the mischief wrought hy the demagog
and the agitator, but also In undoing
the good that the honest reformer,
the true upholder of popular rights,
has painfully and laboriously achieved.
Corruption is never so rife as In com
munities where the demagog and the
agitator bear full sway, because In
such communities all moral bands be
come loosened, and hysteria and sen
sationalism n place the spirit of sound
judgment and fair .haling as between
mnn and man. In sheer revolt against
the squalid anarchy thus produced
men arc sure in the end to turn to
ward any leader who can restore order,
and then their relief at being free
from the Intolerable burdens of class
hatred, violence and demagogy Is such
that they cannot for some time be
aroused to Indignation against mis
deeds by men of wealth; so that they
permit a new growth of the very
abuses which were In part responsible
for the. original outbreak. The one
hope for success for our people lies In
a resolute and fearless, but sane and
cool-headed advance along the path
marked out last year by this very con
gress. There must be a stern refusal
to be misled Into following either that
base creature who appeals and panders
to the lowest Instincts and passions in
order to arouse one set of Americans
against their fellows, or that other
creature, equally base but no baser,
who in a spirit of greed, or to accu
mulate or add to an already huge
fortune, seeks to exploit his fellow
Americans with callous disregard to
their welfare of soul and body. The
man who debauches others In order to
obtain a high office stands on an evil
equality of corruption with the man
who debauches others for financial
profit; and when hatred Is sown the
crop which springs up can only be
evIK
Duty of the People.
The plain people who think the
mechanics, farmers, merchants, work
ers with head or hand, the men to
whom American traditions are dear,
who love their country and try to act
decently by their neighbors, owe it to
themselves to remember that the most
damaging blow that can be given pop
ular government ia to elect an un
worthy and sinister agitator on a
platform of violence and hypocrisy.
Whenever such an Issue la raised in
this country nothing can be gained by
flinching from It for In such case dem
ocracy Is Itself on trial, popular self-
f government under republican forms is
tself on trial. The triumph of the
mob is Just as evil a thing ss the tri
umph of the plutocracy, and to have
escaped one danger avails nothing
whatever If we sucuumb to the other.
In the end the honest man, whether rich
or poor, who earns his own living and
tries to deal justly by hlr fellows, has
as much to rear from the insincere
and unworthy demagog, promising
much snd performing nothing, or else
performing nothing but evil, who
would set on the mob to plunder the
rich, aa from the crafty corruptlonist,
who, for his own ends, would permit
the common people to be exploited by
the very wealthy. If we ever let this
government fall Into the hands of men
of either of these two classes, we shall
show ourselves false to America's past, j
Moreover, the demagog and corrup- 1
tlonlst often work hand In hand. There
are at this moment weilthy reaction
aries of such obtuse morality that they
regard the public servant who prose- 1
cutes them when they violate the law,
or who seeks to make them bear their
proper share of the public burdens, as
being even more objectionable than
the violent agitator who hounds on
the mob to plunder the rich. There Is
nothing to choose between such a re
actionary and such an a.-rttator; funda
mentally they are alike In their selfish
disregard of the rights of others: ind
It Is natural that they should jo'n In
opposition to any movement of which
the aim Is fearlessly to do exact and
even Justice to all.
Railroad Employees' Hours.
I call your attention to the need of
passing the bill limiting the number
of hours of employment of railroad
employees. The measure is a very
moderate one and I can conceive of no
serious objection to It. Indeed, so far
as it is In our power. It should be our
aim steadily to reduce the number of
hours of labor, with as a goal the 1
Jeneral Introduction of an eight-hour ;
ay. There are Industries In which ;
It Is not possible that the hours of 1
labor should be reduced: just as there
are communities not far enough ad
vanced for such a movement to be for I
their good, or, if in the tropics, so sit- j
uated that here is no analogy between
their needs and ours in this matter.
On the Isthmus of Panama, for in-
stance, the conditions an in every way
so different from what they are here !
that an eight-hour day would be ab- I
surd; Just as It Is absurd, so far as the
isthmus is concerned, wnere wnite ia
bor cannot be employed, to bother as
to whether tne necessary worn is aone
by alien black men or by alien yellow
men. But the wageworkers of the .
United S':s are of so high a grade
that alike from the merely Industrial
standpoint and from the civic stand- j
point It should be our object to do
what we can in the direction of secur
ing the genersl observance of an eight- '
hour day. Until recently the eight
hour law on our federal statute books
has been very scantily observed. Now,
however, largely thru the instrumea- i
tality of the bureau of labor. It Is be
ing rigidly enforced, and I shall speed- ;
lly be able to say whether or not I
there is need of further legislation la I
reference thereto; for our purpose Is to
see It obeyed In spirit no less than In
etter. Half holidays during summer
should be established for government

for salaried officials whose labor la

Children.
The congress st Its last session wli
ly provided for a truant court for t
District of Columbia; a marked step
advance on the path of properly carl
for the children. Let me again ur
that the congress provide for a tho
investigation of the conditions of chl
labor and of the labor of women
the United States. More and more o
people are growing to recognize t
fact that the questions which are n
merely of idustrlal but of social li
portance outweigh all others; a'
these two questions most emphatical
come In the category of those whlcH
affect In the most far-reachlnsr way
the home lite of the nation. The hor
rors Incident to the employment of
young children In faotorles or at work:
anywhere are a blot on our civiliza
tion. It Is true that each state, must
ultimately settle the question lit Its
own way; but a thoro official Investi
gation of the matter, with the results
published broadcast, would greatly
help toward arousing the public con
science and securing unity of stats
action In the matter. There ia how
ever, one law on the subject whlob.
should ! . nacted Immediately, be
cause ihere Is no need for an Investt-"
gatl.m In reference thereto, and tha
failure to enact It Is discreditable to
the national government. A drastlo
and thorogolng child-labor law sheuli
oe enacted for the District Of Colum
bia and tho territories. i
Employers' Liability!
Among the excellent laws which the
congress past at the last session wai
a employers' liability law. It was a
mar'.ied step In advance to get the rec
ognltion of employers' liability on the
statute books; but the law did not go'
far enough. In spite of all precau
tion nerclsed by employers there r
unavoidable accidents and even deaths
involved in nearly every line of busl-
ness connected with the mecnanlc arts.
This Inevitable sacrifice of life may ba'
reduced to a minimum, but it cannotj
be completely eliminated. It Is a great,
social Injustice to compel the employee,!
or rather the family of tha killed or
disabled victim, to bear the entire bur
den of an inevitable sacrifice. In otherl
words, society shirks Is duty by laying1
the whole cost on the victim. whereas,
the Injury comes from what may bej
called the legitimate risks of trade..
Compensation for accidents or deaths
due in any line of industry to the actual
conditions under which that industry im
carried on, should be paid by that por-'
tlon of the community for the benefit
of which the industry Is carried on;
that is, by those who profit by the in
dustry. If the entire trade risk ir
placed upon the employer he will
promptly and properly add it to the
legitimate cost of production and as
sess It proportionately upon the con-;
sumers of his commodity. It is there
fore clear to my mind that the law
should place this entire "risk of a
trade'' upon the employer. Neither tho:
federal law, nor, as far as 1 am In
formed, the state laws dealing with
the question of employers' liability are
sufficiently thorogolng. The federal
law should of course Include em
ployees In navy-yards, arsenals, and
the like.
InveallBu'lon of Disputes.
The commission appointed by the presi
dent October 16, 1H02, at the request of
both the anthracite coal operators and
miners to Inquire into, consider, and pass
upon the question in controversy ia con
nection with the strike in the anthracite
regions of Pennsylvania and the causes,
out of which the controversy arose, in
their report, findings, and award exprest
the belief "that the state and federal
governments should provide the ma
chinery for what may be called the com
pulsory Investigation of controversies be
tween employers and employees when
they arise." This expression of belief.
Is deserving of the favorable considera
tion of the congress and the enactment
of Its provisions Into law. A hill has
already been Introduced to this end.
Records show that during the 2ft
years from January 1, 1881, to December.
31, 1900, there wero strikes affecting 117.
509 establishments, ami 8,103,694 employees
were thrown out of employment. Dur
ing
the
same pei i
Involving
i, throwing
mplnyment
id there were
lock
tits,
employees or $J0i,U!H.lKjo and to employers
of $143,000,000, a total of $4f,(i,n00,00n. The
public suffered directly and indirectly
probably as great additional loss. Hut
the money loss, great us it was, did not
measure the anguish and suffering en
dured by the wives and children of em
ployees whose pay stopt when their
work stopt, or the disastrous effect of
the strike or lockout upon the business
of employers, or the increase In the cost
of products arid the Inconvenience and
loss to the public.
Many of these strikes and lockouts
would not have occurred had th parties
to the dispute been required, to appear
before an unprejudiced body representing
the nation and, face to face, state the
reasons for their contention. In most
Instances the dispute would doubtless be
found to be due to a misunderstanding
by each of the other's rights, aggravated!
by an unwillingness of either party to ac
cept as true the statements of the other
as to the Justice or Injustice of the mat
ters In dispute. The exercise of a ju
dicial spirit by a disinterested body
representing the federal government,
such as would be provided by a commis
sion on conciliation and arbitration
would tend to create an atmosphere of
friendliness and conciliation between con
tending parties; and the giving each side
an equal opportunity to present fully its
case In the presence of the other would
prevent many disputes from developing
Into serious strikes or lockouts, and In
other cases, would enable the commis
sion to persuade the opposing parties to
come to terms.
In this age of great corporate and la
bor combinations, neither employers nor
employees should be left completely at
the mercy of the stronger party to a dis
pute, regardless of the righteousness of
their respective claims. The proposed
measure would bo In the line of securing
recognition of the fact that in many
strikes the public has Itself .n Interest
which cannot wisely be disregarded; an
Interest not merely of general conven
ience, for the question of a just and
proper public policy must also be con
sidered. In all legislation of this kind
It is well to advance cautiously, testing
each step by the actual results; the step
proposed can surely be safely taken, for
the decisions of the commission would
not bind the parties in legal fashion, and
yet would give a chance for public opin
ion to exert its full force for the right
Withdrawal of Coal Lands.
It is not wise that the nation should
alienate its remaining coal lands. I
have temporarily withdrawn from settle
ment all the lands which the geological
survey has indicated as containing, or In
all probability containing, coal. The
question, however, can be properly set
tled only by legislation, which in my
Judgment should provide for the with
drawal of these lands from sale or from
entry, save In certain especial circum
stances. The ownership -would then
remain In the United States, which
should not, however, attempt to work
them, but permit them to be worked by
private individuals under a royalty sys
tem, the government keeping such
control as to permit it to see that no
excessive price was charged consumers.
It would of course be aa necessary to
supervise the rates charged by the com
mon carriers to transport the product as
the rates charged by those who mine It:
and the supervision must extend to ths
conduct of the common carriers, so that
they shall In no way favor one competi
tor at the expense of another. The with
drawal of these coal lands would constl-
tute a policy analagous to that which has
been followed In withdrawing the foredt
lands from ordinary settlement. Tha
coal. like the forests, should be treated
as the property of the public and its dis
posal should be under conditions which
would Inure to the benefit of the publio
as a whole.
