issues Note of Warning to European
Powers Against Trade
WASHINGTON, Dec. 3. A note of
warning to European powers which by
indirect means continue to discrimi
nate against American trade; a strong
appeal to the congress to uplift the
great foreign policies of America
above mere questions of partisanship,
a, triumphant vindication of thei diplo
macy of the administration, which is
characterized as that of "dollars ver
sus bullets; as masterful pride In tne
enormous expansion of American
trade as a result oi the foreign pol
icies of hi3 administration, . and an
earnest appeal for joint action by
congress and the executive to open
new markets for American industries
these are the more striking fea
tures of President 'j afts fourth annua!
message sent o con&iess today.
.The messaso is the first t Jtrfa
i t such communications which he will
ke to congress in the s&ny days ,t
? session, and deals entirely with
foreign relations of the United
tEtes. Beginning with the usual ref
erence to the existing good relations
with foreign powers, the president
adds that these have been strength
ened by "a greater insistence upon
justice to American citizens, or inter
ests, wherever it may have' been de
nied, and a stronger emphasis of the
need of mutuality in commercial and
other relations."
For the first time in its history, says
the president, the state department
has - obtained subsantially the most
favored nation treatment from all of
the countries of the world. There
fore, he says that it is only natural
that competitive countries should view
with some concern the expansion of
our commerce. Hence the warning:
"If in some instances the measures
taken by them to meet it are not en
tirely equitable, a remedy should be
found."
, To this end, the president strongly
recommends the enactment of the bill
recommended by Secretary Knox last
December, permitting the government.
lusmau ui cuts lull uinAiiiiuui
rates of duty against discriminating
countries, to apply a graduated scale
of doxies, up to that maximum of
twejfV-five per cent.
"ilit tariffs are out of date," says
the "esident. "Nations no longer ac
cord equal tariff treatment to all oth
er nations, irrespective of the treat
ment from them received .
It is very necessary that the Ameri
can government should be equipped
with weapons of negotiation and
adapted to modern economic condi
tions.
The state department, "an archa.'c
and inadequate machine" at the be
ginning of this administration, the
president says, nas Decome a new or
ganization, with highly specialized bu
reaus and experts dealing with every
phase of American trade nad diplo
macy. Holding that the essence of
this reorganized service is found in
the merit system, which President
Cleveland is credited with having in
troduced, Presidnet Taft makes a
strong appeal to congress to make this
machine permanent ; by giving the
force of statutory law to the executive
orders governing admission to and
promotion in the diplomatic and con
sular service.
To show that these appointments
are already largely non-partisan, the
president points to the fact that three
of the present ambassadors are hold
overs; that of the ten he has appoint
ed, five were by promotion from the
rank of minister; that of the thirty
ministers appointed, eleven were pro
motions; and that in the consular ser
vieano less than fifty-five per cent of
theconsuls appointed by him were
from the southern states .
"The diplomacy of the present ad
ministration has sought to respond
to modern ideas of commercial inter
course," says President Taft. "This
policy has been characterized as sub
stituting aoiiars ror Duuets. it is one
that appeals alike to idealistic human
itarian sentiments, to the dictates of
sound policy and strategy, and to leg
itimate commercial aims."
The president adds that "because
modern diplomacy is commercial,
there has been a disposition in some
quarters to attribute to it none but
materialistic aims."
"How strigingly erroneous is such
an impression may be seen from a
study of the results by which the di
plomacy of the United States can be
judged," says the President.

"Will Bradner be the next speaker

the president of the senate?
The answer to this question, being
propounded in lobby talks, in an affir

one for whoever opposes them, in the
possession of the speakership and the
presidency of the two houses.
"Mr. Bradner, will call the house
together for organization and Mr. Cun
iff will call the senate together for
organization, so that they will be al
ready in the positions to which they
aspire," said a knowing politician.
"If possession is nine points at law,
it is also, nine points in politics. This
will put the opposition at a disadvan
tage and if the plan goes through born
of the presiding officers will be
elected . "
"I do not know if there will be an
opposition to either of the two presid
ing officers. The national house of
representatives does not elect a new
speaker at every extra session and
this precedent, it seems to me, might
apply to the state house of repre
sentatives." When the interesting point was re
ferred to Senator Sims, who returned
Thursday from the state capital, he
intimated that whether the point was
fact or ficion, tnere was evidence
that there would be opposition. It's a
John Seely case," he said. He said
that it was reported at the capital
that Senator Wood will be a candi
date for the senate presidency, but
that opposition to Bradner had not
taken on the form of flesh and blood.
"It is the general opinion at Phoe
nix," he said, that the extra session
of the legislature will be called about
the middle of January. The report
of the code commission will be acted
upon and a taxation bill will be
passed. I think that that will be
about all that the session will do."

Dr. Belisario Porras, minister from Panama to the United States, was
married recently, and he was one of the happiest but one of the lonesomest
of bridegrooms. His bride was a beautiful young lady of Costa Rica, and ne
married her by proxy. Dr. Porras' government had hurried him back to
Washington before the date set for the ceremony and the bride, owing to a
superstition in her country that bad luck results from a postponement ot the
wedding day, insisted that the event should not be put off. So Dr. Porras filled
out and signed the papers in Washington and then sent them to his bride-to-be,
who went to the altar with a friend of the bridegroom, who read his re
sponses and went through the ceremony. ' '

ME DELEGATES
TO CONVENTION
Monster Good Roads Meeting To Be
Held At National Capital Next
March To Ask Federal Aid
The newest of all the States is the
first to come to the front in selecting
delegates to represent the common
wealth at the Federal Aid Good' Roads
Convention called by the American
Automobile Association to be held in
Washington, D. C, March 6th and 7,
1913.
Governor W. P. Hunt, of Arizona,
himself an enthusiastic motorist, has
advised President Robert P. Hooper,
of the A. A. A. that he has named
Attorney General G. P. Bullard, State
Engineer Lamar Cobb, and Colonel
Dell M. Potter as the trio of represen
tatives from the forty-eighth State.
Colonel Potter is a good roads advo
cate of National repute, and is vice
president for Arizona in the Ocean to.
Ocean Highway Association. Arizona
naturally feels a great interest in the
construction of transcontinental high
ways. While none of the other Gov
ernors has actually named his stats
delegation, many of them have advis
ed that they -will do so at an early
date. Included among these are the
Governors of Eastern States which
were not represented in the first Fed
eral Aid Convention of nearly a year
ago. The good roads enthusiasm
which has been exceptionally marked
in the West seems to be renewing
itself eastward.
The responses from commercial or
ganizations to the invitation of A.A.A.
to send delegates to the Federal Aid
gathering are pronunced favorable
from every part of the United States.
The Commercial Club of Great Bend,
Kansas, takes the lead in actually
naming its delegation, Fred Zutavern
and W. P. Feder having been desig
nated. Many of the largest cham
bers of commerce and boards of trade
in the country have promised to be
present in the convention.
Indications are that every one of
the 44 A.A.A. State associations and
450 local clubs will have members at
the National capital who will pay par
ticular attention to their spokesmen
in Congress, who in some instances
will even serve as motoring delegates.
With farmers' organizations and mis
cellaneous good roads bodies all invi
ted to participate, indications point
to the most representative and influ
ential attendance ever known at any
good roads meeting. i
With the assembling of the present
Congress for its final session, begin
ning Monday, December 2, public in-'
terest in Federal Aid will doubtless
be reviewed. There are some thirty .
different proposals for Federal road !
appropriations pending, but it is not ;
anticipated that the present Congress
at the short session will attempt to ;
take action on any of these. Further

GOODWIN HAY
HANGED IN
PRESCOTT
U. S. Officials Trying to Have Yavapai
County Permit Execution of Double
Murderer to Be Held There
Goodwin, the convicted double-murderer
between whom and death lies
only the formality of being resentenc
ed, will be executed at Prescott, if the
necessary arrangements can be made
with the county authorities there.
When the state board of control
refused to permit the execution at
the state penitentiary, the matter was
immediaely referred to the depart
ment of justice at Washington and
has been under consideration for sev
eral weeks.
It was learned yesterday that the
department had instructed federal of
ficials in Arizona to learn if the coun
ty authorities will permit the execu
tion to be carried out at the Yavapai
county jail. United States Marshal
Overlock was out of the city yester
day and it was not learned if the nec
cessary permission had been obtained
Goodwin will probably be resen
tenced by Judge Sloan of the federal
court at Phoenix early this week if
the permission of Prescott officials
can be obtained and the place as well
as the time of the execution of the
convicted murderer will be named at
that time.
The murder committed by Goodwin
was one of the most brutal in the
history of the state. The case has
been an interesting one from a legal
standpoint from the start . Goodwin
was tried first in the territorial dis
trict court and was sentenced to life
imprisonment but when it was learned
later that the ground on which the
crime was committed was a govern
ment reservation it was held that
the territorial court had tried the
case without jurisdiction and, under
an order from Territoral Governor
Sloan, the prisoners were turned over
to the federal authorities. That cir
cumstance and the fact that Governor
Hunt refused to allow the execution
to be carried out at the state prison
make the case an unusual one.
DOUGLAS, Nov. 25. The Greene
Cananea Copper Company predict
that the copper production of their
mine for the month of November
will reach the 8,000,000 mark. This
is 1,000,000 pounds higher than the
average.
at the previous session to make recom
mendations as to the form in which
Federal Aid should be granted, can
hardly be expected to have anything
tangible ready for vote. The policy
which contemplates a system . of Na
tional Highways rather than a piece
meal distribution of Federal funds for
local improvements in Congressional
districts, is proposed which seems to
command the most powerful support.
Former Cook at Arizona Reform
School Defends Superintendent.
Louis Green, a' former convict in the
Arizona state's prison, one of the
"honor"men sent from the pententiary
at Florence to the state reform school
at Benson, where he acted as chief
cook, came to El Paso last week to
set the public right regarding the real
reason for the recent change in the
management of the reform school.
"I read the interview with governor
Hunt published In the El Pas oHerald
of Saturday," said Mr. Green, "and
came to El Paso as soon as I' could to
refute the charge made by the gover
nor that former superintendent Frank
L. Brown was temperamentally inca
pacitated for the position. In my jud
gment, Mr. Brown was the victim of
a conspiracy and I am surprised that
the governor did not discover it.
r- "Of course I have been a convict
but I am now a free man and have had
all my rights of citizenship restored
and have the necessary papers to
prove it, as well as letters from the
governor and from R. B. Sims, super
intendent of the prison to prove that 1
have done my part in the matter of re
storingx myself to my proper place in
society. Those who have been fight
ing Frank Brown may say that be
cause I have been a convict my word
is not as good as theirs, but before I
a mthrough with this case I believe i j
will be able to prove that my word is
better than theirs. They had an ob
ject in fighting Brown but I have no
other object than to defend a man
whom I found after months of service
under him to be on the square always
and always working for the best in
terests of the delinquent children in
bis care and for the state.
"Brown had forced upon him, pos
sibly through the exigencies of politics
a number of deputies' and -assistants
absolutely incompetent and whom he
could not discipline or remove and
over whom he had no control because
they were placed where they were by
the 'higher ups.'
"So far from being removed, Brown
resigned and his resignation was not
asked for. As soon as he found that
he could not be superintendent.except
in name, he tendered his resignation
and finally insisted upon its being
accepted. Any insinuation that there
has been 'scandal' of any kind con
nected with Mr. Brown's administra
tion of the reform school is unjust, but
it is so covertly made tftat he cannot
reply to it. The reports of Charles R.
Osborn, citizen member o fthe board
of control; of Mrs. Titus, who was
named to succeed Mrs. Boyd as ma
tron of the school in October and of
others, who I know made reports to
the governor, should be made public.
If those reports are correct reports of
the evidence gathered I know they will
not reflect in any way upon superin
tendent Brown but they might reflect
upon some of the others conected
with the school whose names have not
yet been drawn into this controversy."
Mr. Green said he was paroled but
recently from the prison and that he
was to have been retained as cook at
the reform school but thought the pay,
$75.00 per month, not enough for the
work and upon being refused an in
crease of $10 per mointh left Bensn
Saturday night to take a job at Doug
las. Upon reading the governor's in
terview in the Herald he came to El
Paso at his own expense, he says, to
defend Mr. Brown from what he calls
an "unjust attack."
CAMPAIGN EXPENSES.
Within ten days the congressional
investigation committee will meet
again to continue delving into the
contributions to the campaign funds
of 1904 and 1908. After it is all over
the country may know who paid the
freight and it may not but what does
it mattef r now except for political
campaign material?
The live question of the hour is
that the present tendency of legisla
tion is to make elections more costly
instead of less and there never has
been so much money expended since
the foundation of the republic to elect
candidates for office as there will be
expended this year.
A Des Moins man had an attack of
muscular rheumatism in his shoulder.
A friend advised him to go to Hot
Springs. That meant an expense of
$150.00 or more. He sought for a
quicker and cheaper way to cure it
and found it in Chamberlain's Lini
ment. Three days after the first ap
plication of this liniment he was well.

Means Another Big Enterprise For
This City and the Investment of
Several Hundred Thousand
Dollars.
Within a few weeks capitalists inter
ested in development of the vast timb
er resources of Greenlee County are
expected to arrive in Clifton.
This enterprise has been launched
through the efforts of the White Moun
tain Lumber Company, composed of
John Christy, Pete Riley, G. L. Cof
fee, Mr. Wakefield and others, of Clif
ton. The company was organized several
months ago and the interim has been
spent in the making of preliminary
surveys by government officials, an
appraisment of the number of million
feet of timber for sale, the fixing of a
minimum price for the timber, and
the approval of the proposition to dis
pose of the matured timber. An ad
vertisement will shortly be published
by the government offering for sale to
the highest bidder approximately five
hundred million feet of timber.
When this contract is let no doubt
the White Mountain Lumber company
will be the highest bidder, based upon
negotiations already carried on be
tween the Department who have had
their experts on the ground and fixed
the minimum price the government
will accept.
It is the intention of the capitalists
who have become interested in the
project of the White Mountain Lum
ber company to construct a flume, ap
proximately sixty miles in length, at
a cost of not less than $5,000 per
mile. Three small saw mills will
be erected on the forest and a large
re-sawing mill will be erected in Clif
ton. The mill in Clifton will have a
capacity of 100,000 feet per day, in
connection with a planing mill.
At a meeting of the Clifton Chamber
of Commerce held on Saturday even
ing last, Mr. John Christy, President
of the White Mountain Lumber Co.,
outlined to the business men present
what had already been accomplished
and made the statement, that unless
some unforseen circumstances arose,
the success of the White Mountain
Lumber Co., which means a"nother big
enterprise for Clifton, was . already
assured.
, He stated that it would be necessary
to secure a right of way for the flume
and a location for the big saw mill in
Clifton, and he asked the co-operation
of the Clifton Chamber of Commerce
along this line.
A resolution pledging the co-operation
of the Clifton Chamber of Com
merce was pessed and a committee
composed of Mayor Geo. Fraser, Hon.
Geo . Chase, C . O . Billingsley, Sam
Abraham, W. B. Kelly and O. A.
Risdon, and W. J. Riley was appoint
ed to meet with the capitalists and
representatives upon their arrival in
Clifton in the near future and to ac
cord to them every assistance in se
curing the necessary1 right of way and
location for the big saw. mill.
COBB CANDIDATE FOR
GENERAL LAND OFFICE,
The friends of .Hon . Lamar Cobb,
state engineer are actively advocat
ing his appointment to the office of
Commissioner of the General Land
Office of ,the United States. They
have already begun urging the ap
pointment upon President-elect Wood
row Wilson. They are urging in his
behalf that he has been a "consistant
Wilson man from the very beginning
of the primary campaign, that he is a
friend of William J. Bryan, that he
has served for a number of years in
official positions in connection with
the United States Land Office service
at Washington, that he is a sterling
and life long democrat, a man capa
ble of making friends and holding
them, that he is an engineer of ability,
and a man of parts.. ,
Mr. Cobb is a member of the num
erous and powerful Georgia family
of Cobbs, scions of which have been
prominent in the affairs of Georgia
since it was a state, and have more
than once appeared in national af
fairs in many cases leaving their
impress upon them. He has been a
resident of Arizona for a number of
years, was a member of the state
constitutional convention, and ran
for congress against Carl Hayden -In
the democratic primaries at the first
election. With the induction into
office of Governor Hunt he was ap
pointed state engineer and immedi
ately thereafter moved from his
home in Clifton, Greenlee county to
Phoenix where he has since resided.
PLEASED WITH LALLY.
A contributor from Morenci send3
us the following regarding the appoint
ment of Jim Lally to be Justice of
the Peace of Morenci precinct:
"You can't keep a good man down.
With the field full of aspirants for the
honor "Smiley Jim" comes- out two
noches in the lead and knocked down
the plum. Morenci can well be proud
of the new judge. Through his chart
table and courteous manner ,3. M.
Lally has won the respect of every
one who knows him and everyone caa
expect a square deal from the new
judge. The many poor -children
about town, who Jim would pick up
and clothe, besides slipping a half dol
lar into their pocket, will miss him
around the store but they can rest
assured that if he sees any of them
in need, his- pni'se strings is always
open. Here's to Judge Lally.-'
