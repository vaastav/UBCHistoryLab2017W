A Cubic Foot of Gold.
Eflt'toi' CfairlotU DeHwcrat:
1 sec, iu one of our newspapers, this question,
which ia always interesting, and especially so at
this time: ' What ia the value of a cubic foot of
gold f Now in one sense the value of gold, as
also the size of any other unit (i. e. standard for
measuring) cannot be expressed. Gold gives ex
pression for value to every thing besides itself.
The moment we attempt to express the value of
gold it is no longer the unit of value. The ques
tion ia also ambiguous, in that it does not indicate
the country where, the time when, nor the commo
dity by which the value of gold 1S iG be expressed.
If the question means, how many of our dollars,
(our units of value at present,) can be made out of
a cubic foot of gold ? it cannot be answered pre
cisely by a calculation merely. For lumps of gold
of the same bulk differ in weight. The density of
gold depends on the place where it was found and
on the process by which it was extracted from its
ore. So that if one wants to know how many dol
lars can be coined out of a certain mass of gold he
must have it weighed. But if an enquirer can be
satisfied by aveiage answers, such as result from
calculation merely, 1 offer the two following, one
of which takes the gold to be pure and the other
takes it to be "ready for coining:"
One caveat, however, must be entered with re
spect to ull such calculations. The "specific gravi
ty" of gold (i. e. the multiplier by which the weight
of a certain bulk of water is turned into that of
gold) is given variously, by different authorities,
because of the various conditions, not only of the
gold but also of the water experimented on. I
shall use specific gravities furnished by the U. S.
Mint, and take the weight of a cubic inch of water
(when distilled and weighed in air which has a tem
perature of 02 degrees Fahrenheit, and keeps the
liarometer at 30 inches) to be 252,458 grains. A
cubic foot of such water weighs 02,321 pounds
Avoirdupois, or 75,737 pounds Troy. Therefore,
since "line," i. e. pure, gold has, generally, 19.30 as
its "specific gravity," a cubic inch of fine gold will
weigh 252,458x19.30 (i. e. 4872.439) grains, and a
cubic foot 0319014,592 grains (i. e. 902,802 pounds
Avoirdupois, or 1097,138 pounds Troy). Now,
since ech gold dollar contains 23 22 grains of fine
gold, each cubic foot of such gold will furnish
2721 02 dollars, and have 1 842 grains to spare for
another'dollar, provided no gold is wasted in the
coining.
But if by "gold," in the question above, is meant
"gold ready for coining," i. e. a mixture of nine
parts of fine gold and one part of another mixture
of copper and silver (viz : 9-100 of copper and 1-100
of silver) we must use for "specific gravity, not
19.30, but 17 20. Some years ago this alloy was
more silvery than it is now an J the gold ready for
coining had 17.40 for its "specific gravity." A cubic
inch of this gold will weigh about 4858.268 grains,
and a cubic to .t 8395086 413 grains (i. e. 1199,298
pounds Avoirdupois, or 14.J.48 pounds Troy)
Now, since our gold dollar weighs 25 8 grains, each
cubic foot of "gold ready for coining" will furnish
32.)390.9-10 dollars and have 1.193 grains for an
other dollar. But if we wish to know the value,
i. e. the purchasing power, of these dollars we must
go into the market and learn by experience, how
much wheat, or salt, or cotton, or bacon, or silver
they will buy.
If a question were raised as to the value of a cubic
foot of silver we must make the distinction that we
made for gold, between "fine" silver and silver
"ready for coining. The former has for "specific
gravity" 10 55 and the latter 10.30. Silver is alloy
ed in our coins with one-ninth of its weight of cop
per. A cubic foot of silver will weigh, on an aver
age, about G57,48fl pounds Avoirdupois, or 799.025
pounds Troy. Now, since the late silver dollar
contained 371.25 grains of fine silver, each cubic
foot of such silver will furnish 12396.4-5 of those
dollars and have less than one grain more. Were
the silver ready for coining each cubic foot would
weigh 641,906 pounds Avoirdupois, and after fur
nishing 10892.9-10 "dollars of our fathers," (i. e.
dollars of 412 grains each,) would have nearly 28
grains more.
To recapitulate, one cubic foot of fine, gold will
furnish, according to calculation, about 272162),
and one cubic foot of such silver 12396.4-5 dollars.
Each cubic foot of gold ready for coining will fur
nish 325390.9-10, and each cubic foot of such silver
10892.9-10 dollars. Now, inasmuch as the hundred
cents that are in a silver dollar are worth only 91J
of the hundred cents that are in a cold dollar, if the
"dollar of our fathers," (i. e. the silver dollar of
412 grains,) is restored to us their children as an
unlimited legal tender, whoever of us has any debts
to pay had better sell his gold for silver and so pay
his debts. For one cubic foot of gold when ex
changed for silver will pay as much debt as 1.1-10
cubic feet of gold. But it will not, when exchanged,
buy any more salt, or iron, or coffee, or sugar. A
debtor will save 8 cents in each dollar by paying
his debts in silver. But each mechanic, and laborer,
and clerk, and teacher, and preacher will lose that
8 cents by being paid in silver. This substitution
of 371.25 grains of silver for 23.22 grains of gold
will be, just now, a very great favor to all owners
of silver mines, and to all governments, such as
Germany, which have vast masses of silver to sell,
and to all who have been hoarding our silver coins.
This reviving our old silver dollar is equivalent to
giving 8 cents to each man who can "shove" one
off, at par with gold, on his creditors. Silver, if
remonetized, and there ought not to be any objec
tion to its remonctization, ought to have 405.74
grains in its dollar. Our fathers did what was fair
when they put 371.25 grains into the silver dollar,
because then one grain of gold could buy sixteen
grains of silver, but now one grain of gold will buy
grains of silver. X.

The South Fork Creek Disaster.
The following lines were suggested by the terrible
catastrophe at South Fork Creek in Chester coun
ty, S. C. on the C, C. & A. Railroad on Friday
afternoon, 23d Nov., 1877, in which the entire
train was submerged in the bed of the stream by
the giving way of the Bridge that span said stream
and two persons perished in the Creek.
Swift flew the train with lightning speed on South
ern land,
Its precious freight of human souls was whirled
along,
On level track, o'er breams, through hills with
steady hand,
Whilst all within was pleasant chat and merry
song.
Some homeward bound with thoughts of friends to
meet,
And even then could almost see the loved ones at
the gate ;
No thought of danger crossed their minds, time
passed so fleet,
With lightning speed they came all, all uncon
scious of their fate.
Till soon they reach South Fork and plunge into its
angry flood
Of raging, seething surf to their last sleep with
deathly groan ;
The waters close around the fated train, then sinks
with heavy thud,
While human forms are struggling for their lives
e'er every hope i3 flown.
Some grasping tender twigs of leafless trees that
bang o'er raging" stream,
Whilst others down the stream is hurled where
rapid currents sweep,
And others seize on floating raft when feeble hope
would lend a gleam.
Till succor came, but oh ! too late, some death had
lulled to sleep.
In sadness now I drop a tear for those who perished
in South Fork Creek,
And with humanity I weep in loss of those held
so dear ;
Their sad, sad fate has cost a gloom, its horrors pale
my cheek,
As o'er our southern land rings out the wail from
doleful bier.

President Hayes' Message.
The regular session of Congress opened
on Monday last, the 3d of December, and
President Hayes delivered his first annual
Message. We give below that portion of
it which refers to political and financial
matters
"Fellow-Citizens of the Senate and House
of llepresentatives: With devout grati
tude to the bountiful Giver of all good, I
congratulate you that at the beginning of
vour hrst regular session you nnu our cuim
j . . . 0 . . , ,., ii
try blessed with neaitn ana peace and auuu
dant harvests, and with encouraging pros
pects of an early return of general prosperi
ty. To complete and make permanent, wie
pacification of the country continues to be,
and until it is fully accomplished, must re
main the most important of all our National
interests. The earnest purpose of good citi
zens generally to unite their efforts in this
endeavor is evident. It found decided ex
pression in the resolutions announced in 1876
by the National Conventions of the leading
political parites of the country. There was
a widespread apprehension that the momen
tous results iu our progress as a nation,
marked by the recent amendments to the
Constitution, were in imminent jeopardy ;
that the good understanding which prompt
ed their adoption in the interest of a loyal
devotion to the general welfare might prove
a barren truce, and that the two sections of
1
the country once engaged in civil sirne
might be again almost as widely severed
and disunited as they were when arrayed in
arms against each other. The course to be
pursued, which in my judgment seemed
wise in the presence of this emergency, was
plainly indicated in my inaugural address.
It pointed to the time which all our people
desire to see when a genuine love of our
whole country, and of all that concern Us
true welfare, shall supplant the destructive
forces of the mutual animosity of races and
of sectional hostility. Opinions have differ
ed widely as to the measures best calculated
to secure this great end. This was to be
expected. The measures adopted by the
administration have been subjected to severe
and varied criticism. Any course whatever
which might have been entered upon would
ceitainly have created distrust and opposi
tion. These measures were, in my judg:
ment, such as were most in harmony with
the Consitution and with the genius of our
people, and best adapted under all the cir
cumstances to attain the end in view.
Iieneficient results already apparent prove
that these endeavors are not to be regarded
as a mere experiment, and should sustain
and encourage us in our efforts. Already
in the brief period which has elapsed, the
immediate effectiveness, no less than the
justice of the course pursued, is demonstra
ted, and I have an abiding faith that time
will furnish its ample vindication in the
minds of the great majority of my fellow
citizens. The discontinuance of the use of
the army for the purpose of upholding local
government in two States of the Union was
no less a constitutional duty and require
ment under the circumstances existing at
the time, than it was a much needed meas
ure for the restoration of local self-government
and the promotion of National har
mony. The withdrawal of the troops from
such employment was effected deliberately
and with solicitous care for the peace and
good order of society and the protection of
the property and persons and every right
of all classes of citizens. The results that
have followed are indeed significant and
encouraging, and all apprehension of dan
ger from remitting those States to local self
government isdispelled, and a most salutary
change in the minds of the people has be
gun and is in progress in every part of that
section of the country, once the theatre of
unhappy civil strife, substituting for sus
picion, distrust and aversion, concord, friend
ship and patriotic attachment to the Union.
No unprejudiced mind will deny that the
terrible and often fatal collisions which for
several years have been of frequent occur
rence, and have agitated and alarmed the
public mind, have almost entirely ceased,
and that a spirit of mutual forbearance and
hearty National interest has succeeded.
There has been a general re-establishment
of order and of the orderly administration of
justice, and instances of remaining lawless
ness have become of rare occurrence. Po
litical turmoil and turbulence have disap
peared and useful industries have been re
sumed. Public credit in the Southern
States has been greatly strengthened and
the encouraging benefits of a revival of com
merce between the sections of the country
lately embroiled in civil war are fully en
joyed. Such are some of the results already
attained upon which the country is to be
congratulated. They are of such import
ance that we may with confidence patiently
await the desired consummation that will
surely come with the natural progress of
events. It may not be improper here to
say that it should be; our fixed and unaltera
ble determination to protect by all available
and proper means under the Constitution
and the laws the lately emancipated race iu
the enjoyment of their rights and privileges,
and I urge upon those to whom heretofore
the colored people have sustained the rela
tion of bondmen, the wisdom and justice of
humane and liberal local legislation with
respect to their education and general wel
fare. A firm adherence to the laws, both
National and State, as to the civil and polit
ical rights of the colored people, now ad
vanced to full and equal citizenship, the im
mediate repression and sure punishment by
the national and local authorities within
their respective jurisdictions of every in
stance of lawlessness and violence toward
them is required for the security alike of
both races, and is justly demanded by the
public opinion of the country and the age:
In this way restoration of harmony and
good will and the complete protection of
every citizen in the full enjoyment of every
Constitutional right will surely be attained.
Whatever authority rests with me to this
end I shall not hesitate to put forth. W hat
ever belongs to the power of Congress and
the jurisdiction of the Courts of the Union
they may confidently be relied upon to pro
vide and perform, and to the Legislatures,
the Courts and the executive authorities of
the several States, I earnestly appeal to se
cure by adequate, appropriate and season
able means within their borders these com
mon and uniform rights of a united people
which loves liberty, abhors oppression and
reveres justice. These objects are very
dear to mv heart. I shall contiuue most
earnestly to strive for their attainment.
The cordial co operation of all classes and
all sections of the country, and ot both races,
is required for this purpose, and with these
blessings assured, and not otherwise, we
may safely hope to hand down our free
institutions of government unimpaired to
the generations that will succeed us.
The Currency Gold and Silver.
Among the other subjects of great and
general importance to the people of this
country, I cannot be mistaken, I think, in
regarding as preeminent the policy and
measures which are designed to secure the
restoration of the currency to that normal
and healthful condition in which, by the re
sumption of specie payments, our internal
trade and foreign commerce may be
brought into harmony with the system of
exchanges which is based upon the precious
metals as the intrinsic money of the world.
In the public judgment that this end should
be sought and compassed as Speedily and
securely as the resource of the people and
the wisdom of their government can accom
plish, there is a much greater degree of
unanimity than is found to concur in the
specific measures w hich will bring the coun
try to this desired end, or the rapidity of
the steps by which it can be t-afely reached.
Upon a most anxious and deliberate ex
amination which I have felt it my duty to
give to the subject, I am but the more con
firmed in the opinion which I expressed in
accepting the nomination for the Presidency,
and again upon my inauguration, that the
policy of lesumption should be pursued by
every suitable means, and that no legisla
tion would be wise that should disparage
the importance or retard the attainment of
that result. I have no disposition, and cer
tainly no right, to question the sincerity or
the intelligence of opposing opinions, and
would neither conceal nor undervalue the
considerable difficulties and even occasional
distresses which may attend the progress of
the nation towards this primary condition
to its general and permanent prosperity. I
must, however, adhere to my most earnest
conviction, that any wavering in purpose
or unsteadiness in methods so lar from
avoiding or reducing the inconvenience in
separable from the transition from an irre
deemable to a redeemable paper currency,
would only tend to increased and prolonged
distubance in values, and utiles- retrieved,
must end in serious disorder, dishonor and
disaster in the financial affairs of the gov
ernment and of the people. The mischiefs
which I apprehend and urgently deprecate
are confined to no class of the people, in
deed, but seem to me most certainly to
threaten the industrious masses, whether
their occupations are of skilled or common
labor. To them it seems, to me it is of
prime importance that their labor should be
compensated in money which is itself fixed
in exchangeable value by being irrevocably
measured by the labor necessary to iis pro
ductions. This permanent quality of the
money of the people is sought for and can
only be gained by the resumption of specie
payments. The rich, the speculative, the
operative, the money dealing class may not
always feel the mischief of, or may find cas
ual profits in a variable currency, but the
misfortunes of such a currency to those who
are paid salaries or wages are inevitable
and remediless. Closely connected with
this general subject of the resumption of
specie payments, is one of subordinate but
still of grave importance. I mean the read
justment of our coinage system by the re
newal ot the silver dollar as an element in
our specie currency endowed by legislation
with the quality of legal tender, to a greater
or less extent. As there is no doubt of the
power of Congress, under the Constitution,
"to coin money and regulate the value
thereof;" and as this power covers the whole
range of authority applicable to the metal,
the rated value, and the legal tender quality,
which shall be adopted for the coinage, the
considerations which should induce or dis
courage a particular measure, connected
with the coinage, belong clearly to the pro
vince of legislative discretion and of public
expediency. Without intruding upon this
province of legislation in the least, I have
yet thought the subject of such critical im
portance in the actual condition of our
affairs as to present an occasion for the ex
ercise of the duty imposed by the Constitu
tion on the President of recommending to
the consideration of Congress, "such meas
ures as he shall judge necessary and expe
dient." Holding the opinion as I do that
neither the interests of the government nor
of the people of the United States would be
promoted by disparaging silver as one of
the two precious metals which furnish the
coinage of the world, and that legislation
which looks to maintaining the volume of
intrinsic money to as full a measure of both
metals as their relative commercial values
will permit would be neither unjust nor in
expedient, I must ask your indulgence to
a brief and definite statement of certain es
sential features in any such legislative meas
ures, which I feel it my duty to recommend.
I do not propose to enter the debate repre
sented on both sides by such able disput
ants in Congress, and before the people,
and in the press, as to the extent to which
the legislation of any one nation can con
trol this question, even within its own bor
ders, against the unwritten laws of trad
or the positive laws of other governments.
The wisdom of Congress in shaping any particu
lar law that may be presented for my approval may
wholly supercede the necessity of my entering into
these considerations, and I willingly avoid either
vague or intricate inquiries. It is only certain plain
and practical traits of such legislation that I desire
to recommend to your attention. In any legisla
tion providing for a silver coinage, regulating its
yalde and imparting to it the quality 01 legal tender,
it seems to me of great importance that Congress
should not lose sight of its action as operating in a
two-fold capacity, and in two distinct directions.
If the United States government were free from a
public debt, its legislative dealing with the question
of silver coinage would be purely sovereign and
governmental, under no restraints but those of con
stitutional power and the public good as affected by
the proposed legislation. But in the actual circum
stances of the nation, with a vast public debt dis
tributed very widely among our own citizens and
held in great amounts also abroad, the nature of
the silver coinage measure as affecting this relation
of the government to the holdeis of the public debt
becomes an element in any proposed legislation of
the highest concern. The obligation of the public
faith transcends all questions of profit or public
advantage otherwise. Its unquestionable mainten
ance is the dictate as well of the highest expediency
as of the most necessary duty, and will ever be
carefully guarded by Congress and the people alike.
The public debt of the United States to the amount
of $729,000,000 bears interest at the rate of 6 per
cent, and $708,000,000 at the rate of 5 per cent, and
the only way in which the country can be relieved
from tne payment of these high rates of interest ia
by advantageously refunding the indebtedness.
Whether the debt is ultimately paid in gold or in
silver coin is of but little moment compared with
the possible reduction of interest one-third by re
funding it at such reduced rates. If the United
States had the unquestioned right to pay its bonds
iu silver coin, the little benefit from that process
wou'd be greatly overbalanced by the injurious ef
fect of such paj-ment, if made or proposed against
the honest convictions of the public creditors. All
the bonds that have been issued since February J 2,
1873, when gold became the only unlimited legal
tender metaiic currency of the country, are justly
payable in gold coin or in coin of equal value.
During the time of these issues the only dollar tLat
could be or was received by the government in ex
change for bonds was the gold dollar. To require
the public creditors to take in repayment any dol
lar of less commercial value would be regarded by
them as a repudiation of the full obligation assumed.
The bonds issued prior to 1873 were issued at a
time when the gold dollar was the only com in cir
culation or contemplation by either the government
or the holders of the bonds, as the coin in which
they were to be paid. It is far better to pay these
bonds in t'jat coin than to seem to take advantage
of the unforeseen fall in silver bullion to pay in a
new issue of s.lver coin, thus made so mucli less
valuable. The power of the United States to coin
money and to regulate the value thereof ought never
to be exercised for the purpose of enabling the gov
ernment to pay its obligations in a coin of less value
than that contemplated by the parties when the
bonds were issued. Any attempt to pay tiie na
tional indebtedness in a coinage of less commercial
value than the money of the world would involve
a violation of the public faith and work irrepara
ble injury to the public credit. It was the great
merit of the act of March, 18G9, in strengthening
the public credit, that it removed all doubt as to the
purpose of the United States to pay their bonded
debt in coin. That act was accepted as a pledge of
public faith. The government has derived great
benefit from it in the progress thus far made ia re
funding the public debt at low rates of inierest. An
adherence to the wise and just policy of an exact
observance of the public faith will enable the gov
ernment rapidlj' to reduce the burden of interest on
the national debt to an amount exceeding $20,000,-
000 per annum and effect an aggregate saving to the
United States of more than $300,000,000 before the
bonds can be fully paid. In adapting the new silver
coinage to the ordinary uses of currency iu the
every day transactions of life, and prescribing the
quality of legal tender to be assigned to it, a consid
eration of the first importance should be so to ad
just the ratio between the silver and the gold coin
age which now constitutes our specie currency, as
to accomplish the desired end of maintaining the
circulation of the two metaiic currencies and keep
ing up the volume of the two precious metals as
our intrinsic nioney. It is a mixed question for
scientific reasoning and historical experience to de
termine how far and by what methods a practical
equilibrium can be maintained which will keep
both metals iu circulation in their appropriate
spheres of common use. An absolute equality of
commercial value free from disturbing fluctuations
is hardly attainable, and without it, an unlimited
legal tender for private transactions assigned to both
metals would irresistibly tend to drive out of circu
lation the dearer coinage ami disappoint the prin
cipal object proposed by the legislation in view.
1 apprehend, therefore, that the two conditions of
a near approach to equality of commercial value be
tween the gold and silver coinage of the same de
nomination, and of a limitation of the amounts for
which the silver coinage is to be a legal tender, are
essential to maintaining both in circulation. If
these conditions can be successfully observed, the
issue from the mint of silver dollars would afford
material assistance to the community in the transi
tion to redeemable paper money, and would facili
tate the resumption of specie payment and its per
manent establishment. Without these conditions,
I fear that only mischief and misfortune would
flow from a coinage of silver dollars with the qual
ity of unlimited legal tender even in private trans
actions. Any expectation of temporary ease from
an issue of silver coinage to pass as a legal tender
at a rate materially above its commercial value, i.--,
I am pursuaded, a delusion. Nor can I think that
there is any substantial distinction between an ori
ginal issue of silver dollars at a nominal value ma
terially above their commercial value, and the res
toration of the silver dollar at a rate which once
was, but has ceased to be its commercial value.
Certainly the issue of our gold coinage reduced in
weight materially below its legal tender value
would not be any the less a present debasement of
the coinage br reason of its equaling or even ex
ceeding in weight a gold coinage winch at some
past time had been commercially equal to the legal
tender value assigned to the new issue. In recom
mending that the regulation of any silver coinage
which may be authorized by Congress should ob
serve these conditions of commercial value and
limited legal tender, I am governed by the feeling
that every possible increase should be given to the
volume of metaiic money, which can be kept in cir
culation, and thereby every possible aid afforded to
the people in the process of resuming specie pay
ments. It is because of my firm conviction that a
disregard of these conditions would frustrate the
good results which aru desired from the proposed
coinage, and embarrass with new elements of con
fusion and uncertainty the business of the count ly,
that 1 urge upon your attention these considera
tions. I respectfully recommend to Congress that
in any legislation providing for a silver coinage,
and imparting to it the quality of legal tender,
there be impressed upon the measure a firm provi
sion exempting the public debt heretofore, issued
and now outstanding, from payment, either of prin
cipal or interest in any coinage of less commercial
value than the present gold coinage of the country.

gazing upon it for the last time, the whole

in a deeper sense, I carried it away, a rich

Jrom Bishop Marvin 's last letter from the
Holy .and.
The sands are all spent in his measure of Time;
He has gone to his rest in the flush of his prime ;
From Jerusalem below to that City on high.
From the sorrows of earth to the bliss of the sky
What a soldier was he, in the might of his Lord,
With his armor all on, and his militant sword !
And the souls he has won shall be stars that shall
burn
In his crown at that day when his Lord shall
return.
Mourn we not for the soldier whose battle is won,
Who has heard from His lips the sweet plaudit
"Well done !"
One moment in pain, with his fast-failing breath.
The next, he had walked through the valley of
aeatn ;
All its evil had fled, for his Master had trod.
With the thorns on His brow, all the depths of
that road :
E'en the "shadow of death" was all bright with the
light
Of unspeakable glory that burst on his sight.
Safe, safe with his Lord in those mansions of rest
Where the absence of sin is the bliss of the blest :
Where both pastor and people are welcomed as one,
By Jesus himself, "in the midst of the throne."
No more in the flesh shall his feet press the sod
Of a land made immortal by visions of God ;
For the eye that erst kindled on Salem of old.
Now sees the new Salem's rich glories unfold,
And the soul often sad in this vallev of tears.
Is now thrilled with the rapture of measureless
years.
5f The poor are only they who feel
poor, and poverty consists in feeling poor.
The rich, as we reckon them, and among
them the very rich, in a true search would
be found very indigent and ragged. Emer

Suns in Flames.
From the New York Wrorld.
The catastrophe in the stellar system
the conflagration of a star which caused
so much commotion in astronomical circles
a few months ago, is made the subject of an
article in Belgravia by Richard A. Proctor.
He says that, this catastrophe happened pro
bably" a hundred years ago; the messenger
which brought the news to us, though tra
veling at a rate sufficient to circle the earth
eight times in the course of a second, had
traversed millions upon millions of miles be
fore reaching us last November. If a simi
lar accident happened to our sun the crea
tures 011 that side of the earth turned to
wards him would be destroyed in an instant,
and the rest very quickly afterwards. The
heavens would be dissolved, and the ele
ments would melt with fervent heat. The
question is asked whether the earth is in
this danger, and whether warning would be
civen of the coming destruction, lhe an
swer may be gathered from the facts men
tioned in the article. 1 here have been
other solar conflagrations before that which
was made known last Fall. The first on
rocord observed by Hipparchus occurred
2,000 ears ago. It was seen blazing in
full daylight, showing that it was many
times brighter than tsirms, tne Dtazing aog
st ir. It was called a new star because it
had ever been invisible until its conflagra
tion made its light temporarily visible.
The next new star (or stellar conflagration)
appeared in the region of the heavens be-
tween Uepheus and Cassiopeia tnree nines,
A. D. 945, 1264, 1572, and is expected to be
seen on fire again before long. This star
remained burning at its last appearance for
sixteen -months. It appeared larger than
Jupiter and brighter than Sirius. It did
not attain this lustre gradually, but shone
forth at once in its full size and brightness
as if it had been of instant creation. In
1506 Fabricius observed a new star in the
neck of the "Whale" constellation, and in
September, 1604, a new one was discovered
in Ophiucu. In 1G7G a new star appeared
in the constellation Cygnus, remaining visi
ble for nearly two years. In 1848 another
was seen, which has continued in existence
since its apparent citation, by the aid of
the telespectroscope an instrument com
bining the telescope and the spectroscope
it was found that the increase in the star's
light rendering the star visible, was due to
the abnormal heat of the hydrogen sur
rounding that remote sun. But it couldnot
be so easily decided whether the hydrogen
was aglow with the heat of the star or
whether absolute combustion was in pro
cess. In other words, was it a red-hot piece
of iron or like a red-hot coal ? These star
conflagrations, it is believed, are caused by
contact with other heavenly bodies meteo
ric flights traveling in eccentric paths, or
those in attendance of the comets. The
meteors attendant on a comet continue to
follow in its path years after the comet has
disappeared. The- tail of the comet of 1843
must actually have grazed our sun. New
ton's comet nearly approached it. At any
time we might be visited by a comet might
ier, than either, traveling on an orbit inter
secting the sun's surface, followed by flights
of meteoric masses enormous in size and
many in number, which, failing upon the
Min, would excite its whole frame to a de
gree of heat lar exceeding what he now
emits. We have evidence of the tremen
dous heat to which the sun's surface would
be excited in such a case. In 1859 two me
teoric masses came into contact with the
sun. The downfall of these twobodies only
allVctcd the whole frame of the earth at the
very time when the sun had been thus dis
turbed. Vivid auroras were seen where
they had never been seen before, accompa
nied by eh ctro-magnetic disturbances all
over the world. In many places the tele
graph struck work, the signal men received
severe shocks, and at Boston a flame of fire
followed the pen of Bain's electric telegraph,
which writes the message upon chemically
prepared paper. This was the effect of two
meteors. The effect of a comet, bearing in
its flight many millions of meteoric masses
falling upon the sun should that take place
can be understood. Our sun seen from
frome remote star whence ordinarily he is
invisible would shine out as a new sun for a
fVw days, while all things living on our
earth and whatever other members of the
sour system are the abode of life would in
evitably be destroyed. It a comet came
out of that part of the constellation Taurus,
arriving in such a time as to fall upon the
sun in 3Iay or June the light of the sun
would act as a vail, and we should be in
stantly destroyed, without knowing about
it. If it fell in November or December we
should see it for weeks, and astronomers
would be able to tell us when it would fall
upon the sun. The disturbance upon the
sun would be temporary, but there would
be no students ol science left to record the
effects. The chances are largely against
such an accident. Our sun is one among
millions, any one of which would become
visible to the eye under such an accident,
yet during the last 2,000 years less than
twenty such catastrophes ha ve been record
ed. Mr Proctor, moreover, re-assures us in
another way. He says in effect that all but
one of these conflagrations have appeared
in the zone of the Milky Way, and that one
in a region connected w ith the Milky Way
by a line of well marked stars; that the
process of development is still going on in
that region, but that if there be among the
comets traveling in regular attendance upon
the sun one whose orbit intersects the
sun's globe it must have struck before the
era of man, and that in our solar system
we may fairly believe that all comets of the
destructive sort have been eliminated, and
thut fur many ages still to come the sun
w ill continue to discharge his duties as fire,
light and life of the solar system.
