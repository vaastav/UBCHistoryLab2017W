Fire.
On Sunday evening about half past 6
o'clock P. M., the alarm of fire was
v given, and after proceeding in that direction,
it was ascertained that the
barn of Mr. F. L. Phelps, was on fire;
Mr. Phelps' son, who first discovered
the fire, informs us that one end of tho
barn was nearly ready to full in when
he discovered it. He ai&o said that
there had been no fire about the barn
on that day, nor was lie in uic.nauii, ui
carrying a light there to feed hisliorses.
So that it is considered the work of an
incendiary, beyond question. Scmiic
twenty five or thirty bushels of cotton
seed and some fodder were destroyed
Another alarm was given 12 >1. yesterday,
and arose from the burning of
Mr. J. M. LeGrand's chimney, which
resulted in no damage whatever, beyond
frightening the female portion of the
iumates.
Sales Day. '
Monday last being sales day, there
were certain tracts of land sold by the
Sheriff, some to satisfy executions and
come by order of the Circuit Coutt and
Probate Judge.
Oue would have imagined from the
. - ?
small attendance of buyers and the
low prices obtained, that lie had returned
to sales day for July or August ?
We have never before known such low
prices at such favorable rate*, for the
uiooth of December, and cannot but
regard it as an indication of the poverty
stricken condition of our people. Lands
would have brought better prices in
1865, just after the war. We offer Radical
! misrule for a solution of the ^ucsticu.
Can any one correct us.

United States Senator.
Several ineffectual ballots for Unired
States Senator were held on Tuesday.
Among the nominees we see tho na:nc

The members of this Association for
Kershaw District, are determined to
celebrate the occasion of their annual
meeting with a speech and a supper, ii
their funds will permit, on the evening
of the 20th instant.
In our next issue, we will endeavor
to give a sketch of the programme, iti
eluding the name of the speaker for the
occasion and his theme.
Meantime, all members are notified
in order that they may attend, and

All wlio served honorably, durinp

12,000 died the death of heroes.
Significant movements.
Many of our readers who are unable
to provide themselves with the great
metropolitan jonrnals, arc, no doubt,
in comparative darknebs in regard tc
the means employed in the great State
of Missouri, in the late election, to
carry it for the conservatives.
They nominated for Governor, lion

publican, and an advocate for reform ir

fought, upon very much the same plat
form as that of the Union Reform Purtj
hi this State. Their watchwords were
"retrenchment and reform, acquies'
- cence in the result of the legislation o
Congress without regard to the colorcc
people, and general amnesty to all wh:
were disfranchised by reason of partici
potion in the rebellion."
The result was the redemption of tin
State from Radical misrulo by a larg<
majority. As in this State, so in Mis
souri there were those who call them
selves "white man's government"' sd
vocates, but in? no instance were thej
successful, and their opposition onlj
served to show, how large a majority
of the whites approved of and upheit
the policy of acquiescence iu accom
plished facts, and their dcterminatioi
uot to revive thoso old and dead ques
tions, upon which the country was di
jVided iu 1863. Their policy, like ours
' was progressive, and it demonstrates tlx
wisdom of our action, that other part
of this great country arc determine*
that war questions shall be abolished
aDd only those measures adopted whicl
tend to our advancement in materia
prosperity, and tho building up of ou
waste places. In other words, Sout!
Carolina is two years ahead of most o
her sister States, in political wisdor
god foresight.

From Scima, Ala.
Wo havo been permitted to mate
the following extract from the letter of (
a lady of Selma, to her friend in 1
this place: '
Selma, Nor. 13,1370. \
"The change from the quic: streets
of Camden, to the more bu-y ones of
Selma I find very decided, and the sppcaranccs
indicate a prosperity very
desirable for your once prosperous town.
Arc you never to have a revival of your
former prosperity, when you could
boast of trade by the millions? Although
the war aud its events have left their
mark upon your town and its inhabitants,
may not the stagnation bc-churged
in a measure to a want of energy on the
part of your citizens ? have they not
fo'ded their hands and been Waiting,
Muccawber-likc, for something to turn
. J e ?? *k?:?. ?i
up, lusicnu Ul. pulling men iiuuuiuuia
to the wlici'l, and by a lonjr pull, and a
pull altogether, endeavored to raise the
old town from her present depressed
condition ? Why have the once contemplated
Rail llouds been suffered to
die unnatural deaths? Two years since
when in your town the subject was all
the talk, but in a recent visit 1 found
the subject completely tabooed. Surely
the salvation of tne people of Kersjiaw
should prompt them D one combined
effort to regenerate their fallen fortunes,
for those who would be prospered,
like those who would ho free, must
strike the blow themselves.
It is very true that your State in gonera],
as well as jour especial portion has
been, and unfutunately is again cursed
with fori ign rule that is fast sapping her
prosperity, yet South Carolina is not
alone in her misfortunes; other States
are equally afflicted, but they have not
b.-cu perhaps so supine.
After leaving Carolina you meet with
continued evidences of prosperity, both
towns and cities are on the increase.?

Atlanta exhibits a thrift not inferior to
that which fii>t brought her into being.
She is rising Phoenix like from her
ashes. Selma, although not so harshly
dealt with as some of our Southern ciiie",
yet she was crippled in her commercial
affairs to a largo extent, but she is fust j
coming up to her former prosperous
condition. The contemplated network
of Hail Holds is being pushed to a con1
elusion that will give her cularged fa?

I road under the charge of Geo. Forrest,
: is furnishing evidence of that gentle;
man's energy, and it will now bo among
the links of communication betweeu the
North and remote South.
Selma ha. Recently passed through
1 an ordeal that might have been fraught
with more serious consequences than
' would have been desirable under the

Gen. Pott us, and other prominent
1 citizens, but not until the whites had
assembled armed and fully determined
to maintain the laws even to the bitter
end. The Fifteenth Amendments wrc
' brought to their senses, not until they
" had so severely beaten a white man by
the name of llaxton that he died the Dcxt

affair might have ended in a general

Friday,' the 2d instant, the following
particulars of the rcceut military
raid in that place, accompanied with the
irrest ofseverd prominent citizens, before
briefly noticed in our columns:
Up to Frid?y nightnasf, two companies
of United Stat?tiru<>ps were posted
at this place. On^ that night one
.Jickson, a Deputy-ted Sratrs Marshal,
accompanied byi'asijuad of about
fifteen mounted United States soldiers
arrived in town. Ob Friday, infantry
and artillery, numooritig about five
hundred men, debarked at Newberry,
and took up the miiph towards Laurcus,
establishing Newberry as a bisc of
operations, and occupying various
strategic points MongTbe line to this
place. The object of this great
military oauipaigji was the arrest of citizens
in this County, wlm were chatged
witl? hnrln<? taken naet- in the distur
bance (?? the 20th October last. This j
great display olf force was intended 10
meet the mighty host of Laurens rebels
reported by ^vrews, (poor Joe,) and
possibly Governor Scutr, as ready to
come up f'OBi the grouted, fully Hrined,
to defy thot standards of. King Grant
aid his afioy. Tho ^strategy of the
campaign [began early on Saturday
morning. !A Licutenunt of the Kiglitcenth

of Mr. S.'D. G irlingtor, invited liiin
to the town, to show a ujotn, which th^
Licntcn&nt desired toJrent, decoyed
liim to the rear "a retire" room, when
suddenly Jackson appeared with a
squad of soldiers, who took charge of
Mr. G., and inarched him to the railroad
depot, the guard hoiise, where lie
was held under the bayonet. The
deputy, with u mounted squad, spent
the remainder ol the day in scouring
the surrounding country, but made no
arrests. Lute in the afteri'ton Colonel

days back. In a trncus last week he
killed another black man. He was
arrested and imprisoned. In this sad
extremity did begot succour from the
Radical adventurers in Sivanriuh ? Did
lie even think it worth while to make
his appeal fur help in that direction ?
From the gloom of his prison, his
uiitid fixtd instinctively upou the man
who had once exercised gentio sway
over him, and who was many miles

he wrote ono of the most piteous letters
we have ever read, begging him for

the more firmly to mittuuch'themselves
and htrcfyjthen[their lines ?.f parallels.
There seems, tin return, but a Vaiis
prospect of Paris being relieved from
uny attack which can be made from
within its wails. Nor do we perceive
any s did hope from the Army of the
Loire without. The whole of the Ger
man forces are now concentrated around
the capital of the French nation
They may be said to Ijavo a double
fjic<\ Th j one, in a" r mg ootrcnchiueuts
and lines, complete.y investing I'mi-j
the other, looking rather outwards, and
prepared to resist any attempt at relief
or attack from without.' Tito evident
policy of Von Moltke is, as in ilie
ease of Mctz and Sedan, to force Paris

it is so thoroughly to sat round and
prevent ?c-e?* to it as to compel it*
surrender fiom sheer starvation and
incapacity to hold "lit any hmgoi;
This has been the policy steadily pur
sued froni .the .-'beginning. If, is clear
that, deprived of : It access, and, us it
were, imp-ne rablv sealed up, the
question of surrender is only one of
time. There must como the period
when ii.o stock of provisions wilt be
exhausted, mid when, whatever the
patrio isMi or spirit of endurance, nature
itself wiil have, face to face, to meet
tho stern alternative of capitulation or
death. And this alternative is now,
according to the telegraphic dispatches
hastening to it consummation. Paris,
has not been provisioned since its first

to rear its awful head. Held as in
the grip of a vice, it cannot burst the
bars of the bayonet*; by which it is

IU.il, 1870. altera long mid painful si.ff-ring.
On tin* loih of November. 18 W. bo una pui?trated
from pnoimiiitiiii which rnn into gallop,
ing consumption. and in Aiiifii-t ItioC lie was
kii l.ir deliili ateo hr could not nttoiid to his
duties. On the 17th of October lust, I visited
him. nt bis request, and found biiu in 11 state
fifg eat debility and under n jrre.it concein
for his iiiiinort.il soul. Igave him nil the iua
ruction, admonnii n mid encouragement I
eon Id. I followed this visit by three others,
still encouraging and strengthening hint My
hist visit wnson the Idili iiist., mid he told me
he was reconciled to Ihe will of God, he was
ready to go to his blessed Redeemer at. anj
inouient. and though his stifleiing was very
it rent he did not murmur at stay ine so long,
but freely siibiuitteo to tin* will ot God. On
the tbtli ult, lie called bis funity around his
bed mid told tlieui lie would not live ti I night,
and begged t hem not to grieve lor him, for he
w.ib going home to glor,, and earnestly entreat
eil tbelli to prepare to uo et him where parting
will be no more. Me was sensible to tin*
Inst, mid at 10 o'clock that night lie breathed
liis last, mid fell into the arms of his blessed
Redeemer.
Sweet to rejoice in lively hope.
That when my change shall come,
Angels will hover 'round my bed
And watt my spirit home.
There shall my disembodied soul
View Jesus mid adore :
Be with his likeness satisfied.
And grieve and sin no more.
