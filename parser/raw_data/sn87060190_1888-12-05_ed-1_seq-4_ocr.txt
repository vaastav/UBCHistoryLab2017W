London, Dec. 6. Commenting on PresI
dent Cleveland's message, the Standard
soys:
"Cleveland's farewell message to congress
might have been a pracious, dignified com
position if tlie president could only have
effaced from his recollection the unsuccessful
electioneering coup by which ho sullied
an otherwise honorable record. The liijurer,
according to the proverb, can never forgive,
and n diplomatic equivalent of tne suyiwr
is admirably illustrated by the paragraph in
the message which relates to the Siiekville
incident.
"Englishmen cm afford to smile at such
puerile nonsense, for even Cleveland's own
countrymen will not pretend to take it in
Good earnest. Vaporings of this kind wero
well enough while tlio preside ntfal campaign
was on, but it is past and done with now,
and the attempt to exhibit one of his hnlf
forgottcn bits of stago furniture as a genu
iue work of art, draws nothing but juers
from the gallery.
"There is no sense and no consistency in
Cleveland's account of the doplorable trans
action. Lord Sackvillo was technically In
the wrong, no doubt. Mr. Russell Lowell
and Mr. Phelps have committed themselves
in the samo way, though not in the same de
gree, scores of times in address whioh En
glishmen have read with much edification
and not the smallest trace of resentment. It
is to no one's interest to perpetuate bad
blood. Statesmen at Washington who argue
that Canadian agitation is getting ripe, and
that annexation hns become within the pule
of practical politics, are not blind to the fact
that a plan of exasperation of the dominion
is not so judicious as that of cultivating
friendly relations."
Tho Chronicle siyi: "Wo trust that PresI
dent's Cleveland's reference to the dismissal
of our embassador as an extremity to bo
, deeply J egretted will be regarded by Lord
Salisbury as kulilcieut roasoN for the ap
pointment of Lrd Sxckville's buccoss or
without further delay.',
The Post says; "That diplomacy at
AVashington is rupidly resinning its nominal
character may bo inferred from the words
of Mr. Cleveland. Should this view prove
correct it will Im a source of unmixed pleas,
ure to all sensible men on each side of the
Atlantic."
The Times makes no comment on the mes
sage. AVur It u mors.
London, Dec. 5. The Standard's cor
respondent at R)ine says: "The French
government has Fecretly advised the pope
to leave Italy in the event of a rupture
between Fru.ice and Italy, and has offered
all possible assistance in case ho decides to
go to Franco. Too Tribuua hoars thnt the
pope has charged Mgr. Galimberti to visit
the duke of Lichlensrein and thank him for
his generous o Iters. It says that his holiness
' has no present intention of leaving Rome,
but thnt if Italy became involved in a war
he would willingly take refuge at Vuduz."
No news received of late more decidedly
confirms tho fact thut there is a-geueral ex
pectation of war in Europe among the dip
lomates. That Italy expects to bo a bellig
erent Is further evidenced by tho fact that
important fortifications are being erected in
Savoy outside of tho neutralized zone of the
Franco Icnlinn frontier, the very strictest
secrecy being observed.
The Berlin journals are vigorously pro
testing nuoinst the Germans taking any
