Arraigns Morruonisni and

UTAH GIVEN OVER
TO POLYGAMISTS
Declares Power Vested in
Chief Executive Was Used
to Aid Smooths Cause
SPECIAL DISPATCH TO THE CALL
WASHINGTON, Dec. 13. — Senator
Dubols of Idaho In the Senate today
fcharped President Roosevelt with linv
tnjr aided the Mormoni In the last elec
tion In Idaho and Utah. The Senator's
cpeerh was a caustic arraignment of
MnrmonUra and what he described aa
the President** attitude toward that or
ganization. He spoke for three hours
knd held xhf do** attention of Senators.
Dubols declared that Mormonltm wa«
the only l»mr In Idaho last fall, and
»et the President sent Secretary Taft
Into that State to talk for "law and
order."*
Dubois went into the history of the
Mormon church, its relation to elec
tions in the States where it was strong
est and declared that the destruction of
the influence of the church !n politics
would accomplish more toward wiping
out polygamy than anything else
Speaking of the Idaho incident he said
!n part: /
"XVhen Governor Gooding of Idaho
and the chairman of the Republican
State committee were engaged in citing
taw-breaking -and - law-defying* Mor
mons to additional lawlessness,: tn"e
President of the United States sent" his
Secretary of -"War 'intoildaho~ to plead
tvith the people .to stand by Governor
Qooding in order to maintain law and
order In Idaho. .*
CALLS IT TN-A3IERICA.V*
"The non-Mormon citizenship of Utah
and Idaho think they are entitled to
the support of law-abiding citizens
everywhere in their efforts to maintain
American citizenship in these Mormon
States, and if they - annot receive that I
they have the right to demand that
the President of the United States shall
not use the great power vested in him
tn the interest of these law-defying,
and un-American organizations in their
fletermination to rule the politics of
this section." . '
Polygamous relations were being
sustained, Dubois said, by President
Joseph Smith and a majority' of the
twelve apostles. Polygamists, he said,
occupy the highest positions politically
and In the church, an constitute the
wealthiest and most powerful mem
bers of the church organization. Polit
ically, he said, the Mormon .church has
absolute sway In Utan and is extending
Its control into Wyoming, Idaho and
Oregon.
As to Senator Smoot, he said, it made
no difference whether he was or was
hot a polygamist. The Senator was a
pillar in the church and in control of
Its temporal, spiritual and political pol
icies, and was selected ror the Senate
because of his position in the church.
"Smoot,""*, he added, "represents the
thurch and not the State and would
fio the bidding of the church before
be would cerve the real interests of
the State or the nation. By being an
tpostle of the church Smoot . is one of
the chief conspirators and' by his ac
quiescence supports the plans and aims
tf the conspiracy." \.V
Turning his attention to the cam
paign preceding the recent election,
Dubois read the press dispatches of
October 22, which stated that the Pres
ident had sent Secretary Taft to Idaho
tn order to speak in advocacy of . law
fend order. At that time, Duboiu said,
be had telegraphed to the President
that the only . issue was the desire of
the Mormon hierarchy to continue to
dominate the politics of the State and
that the President had been misled if
he thought there was any other Issue.
Dubois referred to messages of Pres
idents Buchanan, . Johnson, Grant,
Hayes, Garfleld. Arthur and Cleveland,
citing what he termed "the menace of
Uormonism" and proceeded: '
*'I call attention to the messages of
the Presidents for two 'purposes— one
Indicates the views of ourfflrmer ex-;
ecutlves, the other to mark the con
trast between them and the present
occupant of the White House. Moi>
monism is more -insidious, more dan
gerous and a greater menace to our
Government and civilization today than
It was at; any particular, period: when
these messages were addressed to Con
gress. Yet the President has not seen
6t to comment upon the situation In
bis recent message to Congress.

Root's New York; Speech vis
a Forerunner i of -Message
That Congress • Awaits
WULD SHATTER
GREAT DOCTRINE
Will Point to the /Japanese
Question to Show <: Need
of Federal Supremacy
WASHINGTON', Dec. .13.— .President
Roosevelt 'in the message that he will
transmit! to Congress next Tuesday on
the report : of \u25a0• Secretary -Metcnlf on
Japanese school and ' labor conditions
in California, will, it is said, take .'the
most advanced ground In favor of cen
tralization of power in the Federal
Government- that '. he has , yet occupied.
It i« «nid that the speech of Secretary
Root In Xew York last. night, which at
tracted so much attention, was but. the
forerunner of this message, and., that
the President, wyi- no. longer occupy
any' middle ground as (o the right of
the Federal Government^© be supreme,
in Tall matters in which . the affairs of
foreign countries or the welfare of the
American" people-* are concerned.
In doing this the President' will meet
the attack made on his policy by Sen
ator Rayner Maryland in* the Sen
ate 1 yesterday. In' this connection it
is said that having definitely and^flnal
ly settled in" his, own mind .that he will!
be able .to combat the efforts. of .those \
who would make, him take, a'second I
nomination:" the .Presidency, *he.

not only Questions connected.with other
countries 'where their rights are. con
cerned, but alsp_ other ] questions of Ta
domestic character which concern the
entire nation. •
In this way" the President will shove
to one side petty and minor mat
ters and open up -the broadest discus
sion of the rights of the federation of
States that has prevailed in this coun
try since the adoption of the Federal
constitution, /it is not to be under
stood tHat he will be writing upon the
subject of treatment of the. Japanese
at all. So far as diplomacy is concerned,
that question is being settled. ' .
He will use the Japanese incident to
point the moral he Is to bring to the
door of the Senate. It Is said that
speech of Secretary. Root can be taken
as "a good index to. the character of
discussion which the President will pre
cipitate upon Congress. "It is also
predicted that there will be more mes
sage's from the President than .were
ever delivered, at a short session, and
the' country will be given ample
food for thought.' -

INTO CHURCHES
OF PARIS
Priests Celebrate Mass Be
fore Throngs and Are
Cited to Appear in: Courts
CABINET FRAMING
\u25a0PUNITIVE 'MEASURES
Clergy May Lose Pensions
and Church Property Be
Taken Over Immediately
PARIS Dee. 13^— Today has been
marked by the total absence ot any «f
the sensational or dramatic Incident*
anticipated In alarmist quarters in eon
neetion With the execution of. the l**w
of separation. The parish priests every
where celebrated mass in the presence
of unusually large congregations, but
the actions of the authorities rrere eon
flned to noting infractions of the law
and eltlng- the . priest* and vicar* to
appear, before Justices of the Peace.*
Everywhere legal notices have been
nerved for the evacuation of the eccle
siastic residences, the semlnarle9. etc.
Several of these buildings were aban
doned without further ado, but a ma
jority of .the prelates announced that
they would depart only under duress.
In. many parishes, both In Paris and
the interior, laymen filed declarations
today for the holding of services in the
designated churches during the coming
year. If this practice is generally fol
lowed. It will be a distinct victory for
the Government, relieving It of the ne^
cessity of cjosing the churches and also
throwing on the clergy the responsibil
ity -for -the discontinuance .of public
worship, r _T.
.MEAMRES BEIXK FRAMED
In \u25a0.'the. meantime, .the. Cabfrt«t-hi pre^
paring measures -to be- introduced in
Parliament tomorrow. , : net result
of the uncompromising attitude as
sumed by the Vatican seems to be that
the clergy will lose its pensions, 35.300
of which have been granted" and ga
zetted since the beginning of this year:
that all aspirants to the prfcsthood will
be compelled to perform military ser
vice and that the taking over, of the
episcopal mansions, rectories, semina
ries, etc., by the state and the com
munes will occur Immediately, instead
of In December, 1907.
According to- well-informed persons,
the Government intends to respond 'to
the attitude taken -by the Vatican by
submitting to Parliament a proposition
to settle" definitely the status of the
church In France. Under this proposal
the church will forfeit all benefits un.-"
der the law of 1905, but It Is to be pro
vided with an opportunity to carry on
public" worship in conformity to -the
common law. Church property isi to
be handed over imemdlately to the civil
authorities on condition that It be re
served for worship and the positions
of Cardinals and Bishops as foreign
officials will be dealt with later, If the
Government finds it necessary to do so.
E.VTER BY SIDE DOORS
Proceedings have been begun In be
half of the" Government against.- the
Sisters of the Assumption on the
charge of conducting a convent : and

of the law against education by relig

_ Every where, it was the same story.
The front gates of the churches were
closed, but the Catholics.' by the gray
light of dawn, were streaming througra
the side portals. The interiors of v the
buildings'" were, well "filled; In several
places there was music. Nowhere was
there the slightest attempt to Interfere
with the services or create a disturb
ance..'Three policemen were stationed
outside the porticos of the churches to
prevent possible disorder, while police
officers in plain clothes were on .duty
inside .to . note . the infractions . of the
law, taking the names of the p bfl!c|atr
ing / priests, and : approximating ith«
number, of those, present, with , the ,ob'-
ject of making reports to the Justices
