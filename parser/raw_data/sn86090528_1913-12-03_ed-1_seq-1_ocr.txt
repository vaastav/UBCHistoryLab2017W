According to dispatches from Jua
rez, a peace commission, sent by the
seven federal commanders, arrived
there last night.
The peace commission was headed
by Odilon Hernandez and came from
Chihuahua bearing a proclamation
signed by Cen. Salvador Mercado,
Huerta's military governor and com
mander of the federal forces In i'l the
north. The proclamation stated that
he Huerta government is bankrupt
and unable to pay Us soldiers.
The simultaneous evacuation of
other federal strongholds in the north
i.i believed by the rebels to be. the re
sult of a concerted decision to aban
don the wtiole of northern Mexico.
The peace proposals were suit by
Cen. Mercado to Gen. Francisco Villa,
rebel leader, through Federico Moyo,
civil governor of Chihuahua state.
Along with it came an appeal signed
by all the foreign consuls in Chihua

"Under the circumstances which
have existed in Chihuahua it has been
deemed --necessary for the federal
troops tov evacuate. I leave in charge
Fretlerico Moyo, a person who is not
Identified with politics and who, there
fore, is qualified to give full protec
tion to foreigners. It is impossible to
remain hero longer, as there Is no
money with which 'o pay the troops."

Arrest Young Benedict
on Extortion Charge
Willi. im Arnold, but a few days a
benedict, was arrested at his home
mar Vcrdta yesterday afternoon on a
charge ti extorting money from his
father-in-law, a Mr. Tate of the Ver
den neighborhood. He later made
bond and was released .until his pre
liminary hearing that is slated for
December 10.
On November 21 Arnold and his
bride-to-be, Miss Aha Tale, left the
Ta;e home, near Verden, for Chicka
sha, where they were to be married.
The father-in-law pursued them to
Verden, accosted Arnold in the depot,
where a lively combat was staged.
They were separated and the couple
came on to Chickasha, w beer they
were married that evening by Kev.
Geo. Sherman.
According to statements from the
county attorney's office, previous to
his marriage Arnold called upon Mr.
Simpson for a warrant for Mr. Tate,
charging incest. Issuance of the war
rant was, on the information furnished
by Arnold, refused, and after the wed-
ing the couple returned to Verden.
It is charged by the state that when
Arnold returned to Verden he called
his father-in-law into the city and de
manded 10 acres of bis farm, the same
to be itj the nature of "hush money,"
and it is said that the two compro
mised on the payment of $1000. Later,
it is said, Arnold decided he wanted
a cow that belonged to Mr. Tate, and
using the same tactics compelled the
father-in-law to give him the cow.
As the case develo;xed, Mr. Tate is
said to have left the country and his
w hereabouts at this time are unknowu.
Mrs. Arnold accompanied her husbaiut
to Chickasha when he was arrested
and following his, release on bou'L

SESSION
OF COURT
BUSY ONE
County Court is Making Progress
on the Docket Trial of Crimi
nal Cases Due to Begin
Tomorrow
The comuy court is now in the
midst of an extremely busy session
that started on Monday and which
promises to continue for some days.
One feature tht has meant much lu
the progress already made in the han
dling of an extremely crowded docket,
is the fact that t he parties to almost
every action are reporting ready for
trial on tho date set.
Trial of cases on Ue criminal
docket will not come up tomorrow or
the following day. The trial of U(
cases, being motions for. judgment
against certain bondsmen for the pay
ment of delinquent costs, and which
wered ocketcd fur December 1, have
been carried our until the last of the
term, to permit of the trial of the jury
cases.
One of the hardest fought cases of
the term is cn today, this being the
second day spent on the action. It is
the case of J. T. Allen vs. M. V. Gor
don and Mrs. M. V. Gordon and is an
action of forcible entry and detainer.
The suit concerns the possession of a
lease on Indian land be' vt 'ug. to
Goldie Seely. M. V. Gordon had leas
ed the land and is alleged to have
fallen $."0 behind in his rents. He
claims, how ever, to have made arrange
ments to pay this amount with another
$j0 when the latter installment was
due. Later a Mr. Hristoe offered to
sell the lease for Mr. Gordon, which
transaction, it is claimed, was cul
minated, the sale being made to "Allen.
The defendant claims thrft the deal
was never made, while the plaintiff is
suing fur possession of the lease. Th-3
case was started yesterday and it ia
expected to consume most of today.
Other cases that have been disposed
of are as follows: The case of J. R.
Hubbard vs. Dutton Township, was
continued. J. S. Mullen vs. G. W. Fish
er, a suit of attachment, was dismiM
ed. V. M. Smitb vs. A. J. Beav."s
et al, suit on a promissory note, was
continued for the term.
A case that created much interest
was F M. Hopkins vs. E. P. Slade et
al, a suit on contract, and in which
the jury found a verdict for the plain
tiff of J100 Jtzi . p' cr-nt interest,
from November 1, UH2.
In the case of Chester Cowan vs.
Geo. Petty, appealed from the justice
court, a' motion for a new trial was
overruled by Judge Williams.
In the case of J. M. Hentley vs. J. A.
McAlister, a suit transferred from the
superior court, the defendant was was
given leave to file an amended answer
to the pleadings.
A motion for a new trial was over
ruled in the case of Dollie Rrummeral
Eggs Selling at 75 Cent a Dozen In New York.
vs. Wight Jones. The action was suit
on account, appealed from the justice
court.
Another appealed case was that of
James W. Stone vs. 11. H, Hansen.
The action came primarily from the
Justice court and a motion for a new
trial was overruled.
The following two cases were dis
missed: FJlva S. Rice, doing business
as the American Standard Jewelry
company, vs. N. G. Steele.
Farmers and Merchants Hauk of
Sterling vs. the Apache Cotton Oil
company, for money had and re
ceived. CONDITION
TOO GOOD IS
COMPLAINT
Opinions as to the present conditio!!
and prospect of the growing wheat
crop vary and it is correspondingly
hard to arrive at any definite conclu
sion regarding said crop. All agree,
however, that wheat never looked fin
er at this time of year, which fact some
claim to be a detriment.
One theory advanced is simply that
the wheat, favored with warm weath
er and abundant rain, is growing too
rapidly and that the danger arises
from the possibility of the plants "get
ting so large that they will commence
to joint, which condition arises nor
mally along about April. If the joints
start ar.. acquire a i-auk growth be
lore the cold weather sets in, some
state that the freezes will materially
damage the crop, while the shorter
wheat will not be damaged in the
least. The water soaked condition of
the ground makes it difficult to pas
ture the wheat.
On the other hand, some are look
ing forward to the time when the
wheat harvest is near, and when often
in the past, the ground has been sadly
in need of moisture. The abnormal
amount of water now falling will un
doubtedly soak the ground to the sub
soil and entirely eliminate the possi
bility of the wheat suffering in the
spring for want of moisture.
The exact figures as to the acreage
in Grady county are not at this time
obtainable, hence the increase in acre
acs over last year's crop cannot be
told. It is a certainty, however, that
the acreage is much larger this year
than last. Official figures furnished
by the government give a total in
crease for the state of 39 per cent.
Certain parts of western Oklahoma
have doubled the acreage and the grain
buyers are inclined to the belief that
the growing crop w ill prove to be the
bumper crop in the history of Okla
homa agriculture.

Washington, D. C, Dec. 3. During
the next four weeks Uncle Sam's In
fant prodigy tlie parcel post service
will be called upon to perform' a
herculean task in collection with the
transportation and delivery of millions
of Christmas gifts. Postmaster Gen
eral Burleson, who Is responsible for
the conduct of this service, iias made
extraordinary preparations to prevent
congestion in postofficer and to insure
prompt delivery of these parcels. Sev
eral thousand additional employes will
be added to the force during the holi
day season and the collection and de
livery equipment will be augmented
wherever necessary. Every possible
effort has been made to strengthen
those parts of the postal organization
which will be under the greatest
strain and Mr. Burleson stated today
that with these special arrangements
he is confident of the ability of the'
service to handle successfully the ava
lanche of parcels that will be thrown
upon it during the rush period.
(The posOIi'asttir Kweru.4 Is anxious,
however, lest the public fail to co-operate
with him lu observing certain
important conditions necessary to en
able the postal authorities to effect the
timely delivery of Christmas gifts. In
order to secure this co-operation he
has caused to be printed for distribu
tion throughout the country hundreds
of thousands of circulars and placards
containing directions for the proper
preparation of Christmas gifts for
transmission by mail.
Christinas parcels should be mailed
early. F'or local delivery they should
be mailed out not later than Oocember
23, aud for out of town delivery as
early as possible, hut In any event in
time to reach the offices of destina
tion at least two days prior to Christ
mas. Christmas gilts sent by mall should
be wrapped securely. The containers
or wrappers should be sufficiently
strong to withstand the necessary han
dling incident to transportation and
delivery.
Glassware, crockery, Christmas toys
easily breakable, glass framed pic
tures, etc., should be caiooilly packed
in boxes of metal, wood, leather or
corrugated pasteboard with sufficient
excelsior, raw cotton or similar matter
to prevent the contents from coming
into contact with any portion ot the
box. These parcels should be marked
Fragile." Postmasters will refuse to
accept for mailing packages that are
insecurely prepared.
Parcels should be addressed plainly.
The addresses should ba complete and
plainly written in ink. The regula
tions require that parcel post pack
ages shall bear the names . and ad
dresses of both the sender and the ad
dressee. If a tag is used the names
and addresses of tiie sender and tho
addressee should also be written on
the parcel itself.
Parcels sent in advance of Christ
mas may be marked "Not to be open
ed until Christmas," or some similar
direction. Written or printed mes
sages such as ' Merry Christmas,"
"Best Wishes," etc., may be enclosed
in parcels, but no other written or
printed communication should be plac
ed therein, as this will subject the par
cel to a higher rate of postage. Par
cels should not be sealed or otherwise
closed against inspection. Sealed par
cels are subject to the first class rate
of postage.
Photographs, printed books, and
other printed matter are not Included
