As predicted in The Herald several
days itiio Charles A. Parker, Cashier
of the Jiaury National Bank, has been
appointed disbursing agent for the
government funds' here used In the
construction of the postofflce build

his appointment from Washington

been made at the Treasury depart

The work will be light although the
responsibility of correctly and accu
rately disbursing $50,000 of Uncle
Sam's cash is considerable, and the
pay will be according to the respon
sibility and not the work. Hence the
place is a most desirable one from
every standpoint.
Mr. Parker will execute the neces

jl-uq v. jaexsou has again been
nominated for Postmaster of Colum
bia by the President, his name hav
ing been sent to the Senate on Tues
day afternoon. Mr. Jackson has been
postmaster here less than two years
yet during that time he has been nom
inated for the office by the President
no less than four times. He was first
nominated in May, lyQ7 to succeed
Col. A. M. Hughes. This was a re
cess appointment and when Congress
met the following December his name
was again sent to the Senate. Some
time thereafter it was withdrawn by
the President 'pending the investiga
tion of certian charges against Mr.
Jackson involving a violation of the
civil service rules. The charges not
being sustained the nomination was
sent to the Senate for the third time.
Congress adjourned shortly after
Mr. Jackson's last nomination without
confirming the appointment or taking
any action .thereon and he has con
tinued to 'hold. His commission, how
ever, expired with the meeting of the
Congress on Monday and his name
was again sent to the Senate.
Failing to prevent his nomination
the political opponents of Mr. Jack
son have sought to defeat his con
firmation, but it is not believed that
there is any chance for the success of
such a movement and it is expected
that before the Congress adjourns in
March he will be confirmed. When
his nomination is confirmed a new
commission, good for four years, will
be sent to the postmaster, so that
his first term, as a matter of fact, will
extend for nearly six years. It will
not expire until just before the ex
piration of Taft's term as President.

ST. LOUIS. Dec. 8. Francis I).
Jlirsehberg, prominent in the Roman
Catholic Church, and a personal friend
of Archbishop Ulennon, also well
known in club and business circles,
and as a director of the Louisiana
Purchase Exposition, was shot and
killed at his home here early today.
Whether his deuth was the result of
murder or suicide has not been deter
mined. Members of the family aver
that he was the victim of a burglar.
The police investigators take the oth
er view, declaring that there was no
evidence of the presence of intruders
in the home. A trail of bloodstains
on the stairway leading from the re
ception hall on the first floor indicated
that Mr. Hirschberg was shot at the
foot of these stairs and then turned
and walked back to his bedroom on
the second floor. From there he
crossed a hallway and passed through
his wife's room to the bath room. As
he returned, staggering into his wife's
room, Mrs. Hirschber awoke just in
j time to see him sink to the floor un-
scious, according to statements made

Almost 200 Barrels, Some
Were Sold For $2 Per
Barrel.
I1 records on the returns from
Maury county farming lands were
broken this year by C. R. Denton of
Glendale, who sold the crops from
twelve acres for a total of $4,352.00,
or an average of $362.60 an acre, and.
It is almost safe to say that the record
on a plot of ground as large has not
been equaled in the state this year.
Mr. Denton planted the laud in Irish,
potatoes and the flrs't crop yielded
1,323 barrels. He sold 1104 barrels of,
merchantable jiotatoes from these to
C. D. Park of Culleoka at $1.75 a bar
rel, or a total of $1,932.00, and sold in
addition 220 barrels of seed potatoes
at $1.00 a barrel. The yield from the
second crop of Irish potatoes on the
same land was 1,100 barrels, which.
Mr. Denton has sold for spring deliv
ery to F. F. Clawson for $2.00 per bar
rel. One acre of the land overflowed
during the second planting or the
crop would have been larger. Mr.
Denton estimates that with the re
moval of about fifty stumps in a part
of this it would produce as high as
150 barrels of potatoes an acre on a
single crop.

from Shady Grove, had a narrow es
cape from death Wednesday imme

Andrews' horse became unmanagea

accident would result. He managed
to avoid this and to strike only a
slating blow to the Andrews' . buggy.
The shafts and one front wheel of the
buggy were b&ken, but no further
damage was done.

TWO MT. .PLEASANT YOUNG MEN
HAVE ' NARROW ESCAPES
FROM DEATH. ,
Percy Register and Ernest Wright,
of Crestvlew, had a narrow escape
from death Saturday afternoon while
en route to Mt Pleasant. The young
men were crossing the railroad at the
MlHart Road crossing when their ve
hicle was struck by a southbound
train. Their horses were killed out
right, their vehicle was torn to pieces
and tne two men
ly to the ground close to the track. Mr.
Register's overcoat was torn and Mr.
Wrlpht sustained ft number of painful
bruises.
Because of the failure of the pur
chasers at the sale of the Everett farm
on Monday to comply with the terms
of the sale, it will be necessary to
again advertise and resell that prop
erty. It was erronlously announced
by the auctioneer that the purchaser
of this property would get immediate
possesion and the buyers acted upon
that idea. This statement was of
course, Incorrect, because every sale
made persuant to the decrees of a
court of Chancery must be confirmed
before possession can be given or any
title pass to the purchaser.
When this fact was ascertained by
the purchasers at the auction they
declined to Rccept the property and
Clerk and Master Akin, of the Chan
eery Court, found It necessary to re-
advertise the property and the sale
will take plaoe at the court house door
on January 25. There will be a spe
cial term of the Chancery Court early
in February when the sale can be con
firmed and deed given to the purchaser.
It (s expected that at the' next sale the
property will bring a much better price
than It did on Monday,
FINE PROFITS
FROM HOG CROP
There are few better or more pros
perous farmers In Maury county than
John Cecil, of Cross Bridges. Mr.
Cecil sold this year $1,840 worth of
hogs and In addition butchered twenty
five for home consumption. Not only
that but he has enough left to dupli
cate this record next year. And the
raising of hogs Is Just a side line with
Mr. Cecil.
An aged white man named Temple
was seriously injured Monday evening
at the cedar bridge over Helmn's
branch just east of town. Mr. Tem
ple was returning to his home from
town and when he drove onto the
bridge another team ran against his
wagon. Wagon, horse and man were
thrown off the bridge, the railing hav
ing broken by the impact The dis-
tance of the fall was about twenty i
feet, but the wagon and steed were not
injured. Mr. Temple sustained two (FARMERS MAKE
broken ribs and was badly bruised and
shaken. He was brought to town for
treatment and was later taken to his
home.
ago, and members of the family told
the police they had never seen it be
fore. The bullet which caused death
was not found.
A minute search of the premises by
the police failed to reveal any signs of
the entrance of intruders. All locks
and bolts were found secure and un
marked. If an assassin entered the
residence, they assert, he must have
used a skeleton key and then careful
ly locked the door on his departure,
leaving the revolver.
Francis D. Hirschberg Is the nine
teenth of the World's Fair directors
who has died, and at least the fifth
who has met a tragic death. James
L. Blair died under mysterious cir
cumstances after the exposure of many
forgeries; Isaac W. Morton killed him
self as did also William J. Lemp, who
shot himself in the bath room of his
home; William H. Nolker died from
injuries sustained in an automobile
accident. The death of Charles H.
Turner, of New York City, was not
fully explained. Coradan H. Spencer
died after financial reverses.
