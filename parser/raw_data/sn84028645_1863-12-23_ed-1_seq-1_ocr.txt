LINCOLN'S MESSAGE.
[From the Richmond Enquirer. Dec. 14.]
We, this morning, gratify the curiosity of
Lincoln. " Recovering but recently from an
attack of the small-pox, some excuse may
be made for tho message. It ls1)ut another
exhibition of his weakness and folly. Why
his Cabinet w'ill permit him to make such a
fool of himself, and render their country an
object of contempt and ridicule throughout
the world, can only be accounted for on
ttie supposition that it is. the easiest way to
get rid of him. They, therefore, permit
him to have the freest and fullest use of his
pen. ... .
To his Proclamation of Amnesty and Re
construction, we especially invite tbe at
tention of our readers, and when the "one
tenth" are ready to succumb, we ask the
privilege of announcing it to their Father
Abraham. : i
. At the present, we have not the space to
review the Message, and do not know that
we shall hereafter find tlie time; but, as
there are some features in it so characteris
tic of a Yankee, we may on future occa
sions refer to this Message. ! !
" IFrom the Richmond Examiner, Dec. 14.1
The message of Abraham Lincoln is to
be found in the Journal of this morning.
' lu style it is bare as a leaf from a ledger.
Such derisive laughter lias been exciteabv
the Hoosier's previous attempts at fine writ
ing that he has no longer spirit to show him
self. Tlie tone is- subdued: the language
dry and plain; the' exposition is brief as
arithmetic. But all reflection upon the
general characteristics of this "State Paper"
is forgotten in wonder over the conclusion
at which it arrives and the proclamation
appended thereto. After reallirmiug tho
universal abolition of slavery, without com-
Emsation, in the broadest manner, Abraham
iucoln offers a "pardon" to all persons in
the Confederacy under the rank of Colonel,
and wlio have not held any civil olllce, exe
cutive, judical legislative, or diplomatic in
the Confederate States, who will give them
selves up, and swear oaths of allegiance to
the United States, which contain aii obliga
tion to accept the proclamation emancipat
ing the slaves, w non one-tenth ot tne pop
ulation of any State has sworn this oath,
the said tenth shall constitute a State Gov-
ment and send members te Congress at
Wasldngton. On condition of such submis
sion, the creatures who make it shall be
permitted to crawl on the face of the earth
and possess property,, with the exception of
siavefcV'i nese are to Deenroiieu in me army
pf the United States and quartered over the
conquered States, where negro eoldiers will
ibi billeted invery .house, and negro Pro
vost Marshals lord It in every village.
Such are the' flrst terms of peace offered
ly :the United Stifces to- the people of the
Confederate States. "These terms arefolned
with many vague intimations that they mayi
oe witnarawn or mociineu as occasion re

tion. In passing through the villages they
found the chiefs civil and the people lios-
pitaiilc; nut although they enjoyed lice
ouarters the first tlay, every subsequent
day's sojourn in these places proved expen
sive, for extravagant prices were charged
for all they received. Among the dilllcul
tles encountered by the explorers, it is re
lated that tho most'vexatious were the eom
plaints of the soldiers, who insisted that
they could not get enough to eat; but at
times, also, the roads were impassable, ow
ing to the rain, and the great anxiety of the
expedition was to get to a place of safety
where they could remain during the rainy
season, wliich would last for four months.
The flora of the district was represented to
be beautiful and novel and the party were
not annoyed by musquitoes or any other
insects biit white ants, which were very
destructive. Occasionally they saw ele
phants, and onco they shot at a iion, but the
tract of country through which they passed
was so much peopled that but lew wild
beasts conld be expected. At last accounts
these ladies were still waiting for the dry
season. Sir Roderick Murchison, In some
comments upon tills narrative, declared that
tho adventurous explorers should bo en
couraged, for they had already done more
than many men would dare to do.

of Congress to-night transacted no import

(ien. Auger made a trip to-day on the
railroad ns tar as Bull Run, for the purpose
of inspecting the road and providing against
raids by guerrillas. The bridges were
found to be in good condition, and measures
have been adopted that will doubtless pre
vent another descent being made upon the
lino within this department. Guerrillas and
small squads of rebel cavalry still infest the
country beyond ilanassas, and depredations
upon Government property between that
point and the KuppahaunocK arc ot Ircqucnt

Xo credence is given to the dispatch stat
ing that Longstreet's force had been sur

of such a statement, although in direct com

New York, Dec. 22. The "World's special
from . headquarters Army of the Potomac
21st, says': At the prcseuttime the Army of
the Potomac is In the same position it -lias
been since it recrossed. the Rapidau. An
order to move to better quarters is expected,
especially as the roads which a few days ago
were rendered almost impassable, are now
.frozen hard. As. far as .we can judge, the
rebels have not changed their position.
Our men have made for themselves most
comfortable quarters, impervious to frost
and fcnow.
; , It is stated in a dispatch of Saturday that
rehel cavalry destroyed two bridges over
Bull Run. .This is hot exactly so. Tliey
appeared in some force, attacked our guards
and set tire to one of the bridges, but tlie 11 re
was extinguished and the rebels left with
