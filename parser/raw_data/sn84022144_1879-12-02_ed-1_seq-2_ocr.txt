ANNUAL MESSAGE
Of Kalbcrfird B. Hayes, President
•f the Palled States.
Submitted to the National Senate and
Jf HMM
The resumption of specie payments have
^been followed by a very great revival
""of business. With a currency equivalent in
»»»seiva|ae t0 the money of the commercial
world, we are enabled to enter upon an
equal competition with other nations in
trade and production. The increasing
.foreign -demand for our manufactures
and agricultural products has caused a
large balance of trade in our favor, which
has been paid in gold, from the 1st of July
last, to November 15, to the amount of
about $50,000,000. Since the resumption
jh of specie payments there has also been a
^marked and gratifying improvement of the
public credit. The bonds of the govern
ment bearing only four percent, interest
have been sold at or above par, sufficient in
amount to pay off all of the national
debt which was redeemable under present
laws. The amount of interest saved annu
ally by the process of refunding the debt,
since March 1, 1877, is §14,297,177.
1
The bonds sold were largely in small
SUUIB and the number of our citi
zens now holding the public securities is
silver dollars upon the present legal ratio. I
The market value of the silytr dollar being
uniformly and largely less than the market I
value of the gold dollar, it is obviously im-1
practicable to maintain them at par with I

NATIONAL FINANCES.

The most intereeting events which have
occurred in our public affairs since
mr Ifwt annual message to congress
-are- connected with the financial operations
of the government directly affecting the
O business interests of the country. I congra
tulate congress on the successful execution
\.% of the resumption act. At the time fixed
,and in the manner contemplated by law,
"•P,l United States notes began to be redeemed
•y in coin. Since the first of January last
*.{{'. the have been promptly redeemed on pre
sentation, and in all business transactions,
S- .public and private, in all parts of the couh
w'. 'try, they are received and paid out as the
equivalent of coin. The demand upon the
5" treasury for gold and silver in exchange for
./fUnited States notes has been comparatively
'small, and the voluntary deposit of coin
*. "jand bullion in_exchange for notes has been
very large. The excess of the precious
metals deposited or exchanged for United

much greater than ever before. The amount IP 5, .9 y- ,,
of the national debt which matures within f00"1
less than two years is $792,121,700, of which
$500,000,000 bear interest at the rate of five I
per cent., and the balance is in bonds bear
ing six-per cent, interest. It is believed that
this part of tbe public debt can be refunded
by the issue of four per cent bonds, and, by
the reduction of interest which will thus be
effected, about eleven millions of dollars
can be annually saved to the treasury. To
secure this important reduction of interest

The pendency of the proposition for unity
of action between the United States and the
principal commercial nations of Europe, to
effect a permanent system for the equality of
gold and silver in the recognized money ofl
te world, leads me to recommend that oon-
gress refrain from new legislation on the I
subject. The great revival of trade, inter-

adhered to from tbe adoption of the consti

national debt, and when, from necessity in
time of war, debts have been created, they
Dave been paid off on the return of peace as
rapidly as possible. With this view, and
for this purpose, it is recommended that
tbe existing lawa.for the accumulation of a
^iihiijg tond sufficient to extinguish tbe

MORMON POLYGAMY.
The continued deliberate violation by a
large number of the prominent and Influen
tlsl citizens of the territory of Utah of the
laws of the United States for the pro*ecu
Hon and puniahment of polygamy demands
the attention of every, part of the govern
ment. This territory has a population auf

will not, however, be approved by the
country while the citizens of Utah In very
considerable dumber upheld a practice
wbichis condemned as a crime by tbe laws
of all civilized communities throughout the
world.

The elections of the past year, though
occupied only with state office*, have not
failed to elicit in the political discussions
which attended theui all over the country,
new and decisive evidence of the deep inter
est which the.great body of citizens take in
the progress of the country towards
a more general and complete establish
ment, at whatever cost, of universal security
and freedom in the exercise of the elective
franchise. While many topics of political
concern demand great attention froui our
people, both in the epiiere-of national and
state authority, I find no reason to qualify
the opinion I expressed ill my last messsge,
that no temporary or administrative inter
eeta of .government, however urgent or
weighty, will ever displace the zeal of our
people in defence of the primary rights of
citizenship, and that the power of public
opinion will override all political prejudi
ces. and all sectional and state attachments,
in demanding that all over our wide terri
tory tbe name and character of citizen of
the United States shall mean one and the
same thing and carry with tbem unchallen
ged security and respect. I earnestly ap

ter in the territory of Utah, because of the
peculiar difficulties attending its enforce
ment, The opinion widely prevailed among
the citizens of Utah that the law was in
contravention of the constitutional guaran
tee of relic
ions freedom. This objtctiqp is
now removed. Tbe supreme court of the
United States has decided the law
to be within tbe legislative power
of congress, and binding as
a rule of action for all who reside within
the territories. There is no longer anv
reason for delay or hesitation in its enforce
ment. It should be firmly and effectively
executed. If not sufficiently stringent in,
ita provisions it should be amended, and, in
aid of the purpose in view. I recommend
that more comprehensive and more search
ing methods for preventing as well as pun
ishing this crime be provided. If necessary
to secure obedience to the law, the
enjoyment and exercise of the rights and
privileges of citizenship in the territories of
the United States may be withheld or with

tbe enforcement of the law on this sub

the protection of the right of suffrage. I
respectfully urge upon congress to supply
any defects in these laws which experience
has shown and which it is within its power
to remedy. I again invoke the co-opera
tion of the executive and legislative author
ities of the states in this great purpose. I
am fully convinced that if the public mind
can be set at rest on this paramount ques
tion of popular rights, no serious obstacle
will thwart or delay the complete pacifica

authority and credit of the government,'
except in extreme emergency, is
without warrant in the constitu1

clples. The issue of United States notes
during the late civil war with tbe capacity
of legal tender between private individuils
was not authorized except as a means of res
cuing the country from imminent peril,
It herewith transmitted to
hile the reform measures of another
government are of no authority for us, they
are entitled to influence, to the extent to
which their intrinsic wisdom, and their
adaptation to our institutions and social life
maycommend them to our consideration.
The views I have heretofore expressed
cpncernmg the defects and abuses in our
"nd tbe people themselves to co-
now generally recognized. In the resolu
turns of the great parties, in the reports Of
departments, in the debatea and proceed
ings of congreas, in the messages of execu
tives, the gravity of these evils has been
pointed out and the need of their reform
has been admitted.
—^?--.C?mma.nd.tb* necersary support, eve
ry measure of reform must be basedon com
mon right and justice, and must be compa
tible with the healthy existence of gc*at
parties, which ere inevitable and easential
in a free state.
When the people have approved a
policy at a national election, con-
Adeaoe on the part of the oOcers they have
•tfeeM, and of the advisors who, In ac
oordance with OM political institutions.
shwW ha consult*!, In the policy wbteftlt
is their duty to catir Into effect, la Indis
pensable. It la eminently proper that they
ihould explain It before tha people, aa wall
aa Illustrate ita spirit In tbe performance of
their official duties.
Very different considerations apply to tbe
greater number of thoee who fill the subor
dinate places in the civil aervice. Their
(esponaibility. is.lo their sbperiors in official
poaiti**:. It la their duty to obey the legal
instructions of those upon whom thst au-
Their duties are the aame whatever party
Is In poWer ati4 whatever policy prevail*
As a consequence, it follows thst tbeir ten
ure ol office ahonld not depend on tbe pre
valence of anr policy or tbe eupremacy of
any party bnt ahonld be determined-by tbeir
cepactty to aerye the people most usefully,
quite im a jective of partisan Interests. The
same conaideration that ahonld govern the
tenure, should also prevail in the eppoint
mentpatafpllne, and removal ot these sub
orainktes. The -authority of appointment
and removal ia not a perquisite, which may
be nsed to aid a friend or reward a partisan,
but la a trust to be exercised in the public
Intereat, under all the sanctions which at
tend the obligation to apply the public
hinds only for public purposes.
Every citizen-bee an equal right to tbe
honor and profit of entering the publle
•ervloe of hie country. The only just
ground of diecrimlnetlon, is the measure of
character and capacity he baa to make thai
aervice most useful to the people. Except
in esses where, upon joat and recognized
principles, aa npon the theory of penaions.
offlcee and promotions are bestowed es re
warda for past services, their bestowal upon
any theory which dlsregsrds personal merit,
la enact of injustice to the citizen, aa well
aa a breach of that trust subject to which
tbe appointing power ie held.
In tbe light of these principles, it becomes
of great importance to provide just and ad
equate means, especially for every depart
ment, and large admlniatrative office, where
personal discrimination on tbe part of its
bead is not practicable, for ascertaining
those qualifications to which appointments
and removala should have reference. To
fall to. provide'such means Is not only to de
ny the opportunity of ascertaining tbe fscts
upon which the moat righteous clsim to of
fice depends, but, of necessity, to discourage
all worthy aspirants, by handing over ap
pointments and removals to mere influence
and favoritism. It it is tbe right of the
worthiest claimant to gain the appointment,
and the interest of the people to bestow
it upon him, it would seem clear that a wise
and just method of ascertaining personal
fitness for office must be an important and
permanent function of every just and wise
government. It has long since become im
possible, in the great offices,for those having
the duty of nomination and appointment, to
personally examine into the individual
qualifications of more than a small propor
tion of thoee seeking office and, with the
enlargement of the civil service, that pro
portion must continue to become less.
In the earlier years of the government,
the subordinate offices were so few in num
ber that it was quite easy for those making
appointments and promotions to personally
ascertain the merits of candidates. Party
managers and methods bad not then become
powerful agencies of coercion, hostile to the
free and just exercise of the appointing
power.
A large and responsible part of the duty
of restoring tbe civil service to the desired
purity and efficiency rests upon the president,
and it is my purpose to do what is within
my power to advance such prudent and
gradual meaaures of reform as will most
surely and rapidly bring about that radical
change of system essential to make our ad
ministrative methods satisfactory to a free
and intelligent people. Br a proper exer
cise of^authority, it is in t'he power of the
executive to do much to promote such a
reform. But it cannot be too clearly under
stood that nothing adequate can be accom
plished without co-operation on the part of
congress and considerate and intelligent
support among the people. Reforms which
challenge the generally accepted theories of
parties, and demand changes in the methods
of departments, are not the work of a day.
Their permanent foundations mast be laid
in sound principles, and in an experience
which demonstrates their wisdom and ex
poses the errors of their advenaries. Every
worthy officer desires to make his official
action a gain and an honor to his country,
but the people themselves, far more than
their officers in public station, are inte.ested
in a pure, economical, and vigorous admin
istration.
By laws enacted in 1853 and 1855, and
now in substance incorporated in the revised
statutes, the practice of arbitrary appoint
ments to the several subordinate grades in
the great departments was condemned, and
examinations, as to capacity, to be conducted
by departmental boards of examiners, were
provided for and made conditions of admis
sion to the public service. These statutes
area decision by congress that examinations
of some sort, as to attainments and
capacity, are essential to the well
being of the public service. The im
portant questions since the enactment of
these laws have been as to tbe character of
these examinations, and whether official
favor and partisan Influence, or common
right and merit, were to control the access
to the examinations. In practice, these ex
aminations have not always been open to
worthy persons generally, who might wish
to be' examined Official favoritism and
partisan influence, as a rule, appear to have
designated those who alone were permitted
to go before tbe examining-boards, sub
jecting even the examiners to a pressure
from the friends of the candidates very dif
ficalt to resist. As consequence, the
standard of admission fell below what the
public interest demanded. It was also al
most inevitable that a system which pro
vided for various separate boards of examin
ers, with no common supervision or uni
form method of procedure, should result in
confusion, inconsistency, and inadequate
tests of capacity highly detrimental to the
public interests. A further and more radi
cal change was obviously required.
In the annual message of December, 1870,
my predecessor declared that "tbere is no
duty which so much embarrasses the exec?,
utive and heads 6f departments as that of
appointments nor is there any such ardu
ous and thankless labor imposed on sena
tors and repreeentatives as that of finding
places for constituents. The present ays
tern dose not secure die beet-men, and often
not even fit men for the public places: The
elevation and purification of the civil ser
vice of the government will be hailed with
approval by the whole people of the United
StaUa.' Congress accordingly passed the
*ct, approved March 3, 1871, "to regulate
tbe civil service of the United States and
promote the efficiency thereof." giving the
necessary authority to the executive to in
augurate amvil-eervice reform.
Acting under this atatute, which waa in
tended to secure a systeal of just and effec
tual examinations under uniform supervi
sion, a number of eminently competent per-
*W L, -.V
sona were selected
entered with seal
for the purpose, who
upon the discharge of
their dutiee, prepared, wlrti aa* intelligent
appreciation tf the requirements the ser
vice, tbe rrgnieUsp* «Mle«pIalad, and took
charge of the examlMHibns, and who, In
their capaclty ne boaid, have^een known
as the "civil-service commission." Congress
for two years appropriated themoney needed
for the compensation and for the expense ol
carrying on the work of the commission.
It appears from the report of the oommis
eion, submitted to the president ie .April,
1874, that examinations had been held In
vartaiiMcetioss of the. .jMuajy, apdjhai
appropriation of about $£,000 would
required to meet the annual .expenses,
including salaries, involved in
diaebargKig thedgties of tie eoiaitaaission.
-The report was transmitted-'to coii|pess by
special message of April 18,1874, with the
following fayorable comment upon the
labors of the commission "If sustained
by congrete, I have no doubt the rules can,
after the expferience gained, be so improved
and enforced as to atill more materially ben
efit the pubiio service, and relieve the
executive, -members of congress, and the'
heads of departments, from influences pre
judicial to good administration. The rules,
as they have hitherto been enforced, have
resulted beneficially, as is shown by the
opinions of the members of tbe Cabinet and
their subordinates in this departments, and
in that opinion I concur." And in the an
nual message of December of the eame year
similar views are expressed, and an appro
priation for continuing the work of the
commission again advised.
The appropriatron was not made, and, as
a consequence, the active work of the com
mission was suspended, leaving the commia
sion itself still in existence. Without the
means, therefore, of causing qualifications
to be tcated in any systematic manner, or of
securing for the public service the advan
tages of competition upon any extensive
plan, I recommended in my annual message
of December, 1S77, the making of an ap
propriation for the resumption of the work
of the commission.
In the meantime, however, competitive
examinations under many embarrassments
have been conducted within limited spheres
in the executive departments in Washing
ton, and in a number of the custom-houses
and post offices of the principle cities of
country, with a view to further test their
effects, and in every instance, tbey have
been found to be as salutary as they are
stated to have been uuder the administra
tion of my predecessor. I think the econ
omy, purity, and efficiency of the public
service would be greatly promoud by their
systematic introduction, wherever practica
ble, throughout the entire civil service of
the government, together with ample provis
ion, in order to secure consistency and
uniform justice.
Reporis from the secretary of the interior,
from the postmaster-general, from the post
master in the city of New York, where
such examinations have been sometime on
trial, and also from the collector of the port,
the naval officer, and the surveyor in that
city, and from the postmasters and collectors
in several of the other large cities, show
that the competitive system, where applied,
has, in various ways, contributed to improve
the public service.
The reports show that the results have
been salutary in a marked degree, and that
the general application of similar rules
cannot fail to be of d«cided benefit to the
service.
Tbe reports of tbe government officers,
In tbe city of New York especially, bear
decided testimony to tbe utility of open
competitive examinations in tbeir respec
tive offices, showing that "these examina
tions, and tbe excellent qualifications of
those admitted to tbe service through
tbem. have bad a marked incidental effect
upon those aspiring to promotion. There
has been, on tbe part of these latter, an In
creased interest in the work, and a desire
to extend acquaintance with it beyond tbe
particular desk occupied, and thus tbe
morale of the entire force has been raised.
The examinations have been at­
tended by many citizens who have bad an
opportunity to thoroughly investigate tbe
scope and character of the tests and tbe
method of determining tbe results, and
those visitors have, without exception, ap
proved tbe metbods employed, and several
of tbem have publicly attested their favor
able opinion."
Upon such considerations, I deem it my
duty to renew the recommendatton con
tained In my annual message of December,
1877, requesting congress to make the
necessary appropriation for, the resump
tion of tbe Work of the dvil-eerylce com
mission. Economy will be promoted by
authorizing a moderate compensation to
persons in the public service who may pet
form extra labor upon or under tbe com
mission, as the executive may direct.
I am convinced that If a just and ade
quale test of merit is enforced for sdmis
sion to the public service end in making
promotions, such sbuses as removals with
out good cause and partisan and official In
terference with the proper exercise of tbe
appointing power, will in a large measure
disappear.
There are other administrative abuses to
which the attention of congreas should be
ssked in this connection. Mere partisan
appointments, and tbe constant peril of re
moval without cause, very naturally lead to
an absorbing Bed mischievous political ac
tivity, on the part of those thus appointed,
which not only Interferes with the due dis
charge of official duty, but is incompstible
with tbe freedom of elections. Net with
out warrant, in the viewa of several of my
predecessors In the presidential office, and
directly within tbe law of 1871, already cit
ed, I endeavored, by regulation, made on
the 22d day of June, 1877, to put some rea
sonable limits to such abuses. It may not
be easy, snd it may never perhaps be neces
sary, to define with precision the proper
limit of political action on the part ot feder
al officers. But while their right to hold
and freely express their opioions csnnot be
questioned, it is very plain that tbey should
neither be allowed to devote to other
subjects tbe time needed for tbe
proper discbsrge of tbeir official
dutier, norto use the authority of their of
fice to enforce their own opinions, or lo co
erce the political action of those who hold
different opinions.
Reasons of justice and public policy, quit*
analogous to those which forbid the use of
officipl-'power for tba oppression of the pri
vate^tizen. imp^se upon the government
the' duty of protecting its officers and agenta
from arbitrary exactions. In whatever as
pect considered, the practice of making lev
ies, for party purposes, upon the salaries of
officers is highly demoralizing to the public
aervice and discreditable to the country.—
Though an officer ahonld be as free aa any
other citjzen lo give bis own money in aid
of his opinions or his party, he should also
be as free aa any other citizen to refuse to
make such gifts. If aalariee are but a fair
compensation for the time and labor of the
offioer, it is gross injustice to levy a tax up
on them. If tbey are made excessive in or
der that they may bear tbe tax, the exoew
is an indirect robbery of the public funds.
I recommend, therefore, such a revision
aM ftxtsosion of present statutes as shall a*
cure to thwe in every grade of official life
•f
or pubiio employment lite protection with
which agreatand enlightened nation should
guard those who are faithful in lie service.
VOMCIOS UW.ATIOSB.
Our relations with foreign countries have
continued peaceful.
With Great Britain there are atill unset
tled questions, growing out of the local laws
of the maritime provinces and the action ol
provincial authorities, deemed to be in de
rogation of rights secured by treaty to Amer
ican fishermen. The United States minister
in (London baft berti instructed to present a
idefoahd for $105,.105.02, in view of the
hHaagesgiK»i«ed by American citiwnrat
Fortune Buy on the 6th day of January,
1878. The t-ul'ject has been taken into con
aideration by the British government, and
an early reply is anticipated.
Upon the completion of the necessary pre
liminary examinations the subject of our
participation in the provincial fisheries, as
regnUted by treaty, will at once be brought
to the attention of the British government
with a view to an early and permanent set
tlement of the whole queetion, which was
only temporarily adjusted by the treatv of
Washington.
Efforta have been made to obtain tbe re
moval of the restrictions found injurious to
the exportation of cattle to tbe United
Kingdom.
Some correspondence has also occurred
with regard to the rescue and saving of life
and property upon tbe lakes, which has re
sulted in important modifications of the pre
vious regulations of the Dominion govern
ment on the aubject, in the interest of hu
manity and commeroe.
IKTKllNATIOXAL EXUIBITIONS.
In acoordanue with the joint reso
lution of the last session of con
gress, commissioners were appointed to
represent the United States at the two
international exhibitions in Australia,
one of which is now in progress at Syd
ney, and the other to be held next year
at Melbourne. A desire has been ex
pressed by our merchanta and manufac
turers interested in the importunt and
growing trade with Australia, that an
increased provision should be made by
Congress for the representation of our
industries at the Melbourne exhibition
of next year, and the sujoct is respect
sully submitted to your favorable con
sideration.
OCEAN CABLES.
The assent of the govermcnt has been
given to the landing, on the co»st of
Massachusetts, of a new and indepen
dent transatlantic cable between France,
by way of the French island of St. Pierre)
and this country, subject to any future
legislation of congress on the subject.
The conditions imposed, before allowing
this connection with our shores to be
established, are such as to secure its com
petition with any existing or future lines
of marine cable, and preclude amalgama
tion therewith, to provide for entire
equality of rights to our government
and people with those of France in the
use of the cable, and prevent any exclu
sive possession of the privilege as accord
ed by France to the disadvantage of any
future cable communication between
France and the United States which may
be projected and accomplished by our
citizens. An important reduction of the
present rates of cable communication
with Europe, felt to be too burdensome
to the interests ot our commerce, must
necessarily flow from the establishment
of this competing line.
The attention of congress was drawn
to the propriety of some general regula
tion by congress of the whole subject of
transmarine cables by my predecessor in
messsge of December 7, 1875, and I re
spectfully submit to your consideration
the importance of congressional action
in this matter.
AT PEACE WITH THE WORLD.
The questions of grave importance
with Spain, growing out of the incidents
of the Cuban insurrection have been, for
the most part, happily and honorably
settled. It may reasonably be anticipat
ed that the commission now sitting in
Washington, for the decision of private
cases in this connection, will soon be able
to bring its, labors to a conclusion.
The long standing question of east
Florida claims has lately been renewed
as a subject of correspondence, and may
possibly require congressional action for
Its final disposition.
A treaty with the Netherlands, with
respect to consular rights and privileges,
similar to those with other powers, has
been signed and ratified, and the ratifi
cations were exchanged OR the 31st of
July last. Negotiations for extradition
treaties with the Netherlands and with
Denmark are now in progress.
Some questions with Switzerland, in re
gard to pauper and convict emigrants, have
arisen, but it is not doubted that they will
be arranged upon a just and satisfactory
basis. A question has also occurred With
respect to an asserted claim by Pwiss mu
nicipal authorities to exercise tutelage over
persons and property of Swiss citizens nat
uralized in this country. It is possible this
may require adjustment by treaty.
With tha German empire frequent ques
tions arise in connection with the subjects
of naturalization and expatriation but the
imperial governmentjhaa constantly mani
fested a desire to strictly maintain and com
ply with all treaty stipulations in regard to
them.
In consequence of the omission of con
gress to provide for a diplomatic represen
tative at Athens, the legation to Greece has
been withdrawn. There is now no channel
of diplomatic communication between the
two countries, and t(^expedience of pro
viding for one, in some form, ia submitted
to congress.
Relations with Austria, Russia, Italy,
Portugal, Turkey, and Belgium continue
amicable and marked by no incident of es
pecial importance.
A change of the personal head .of the
government of Egypt has taken place. No
change, however, has occurred in the rela
tions between Egypt and tbe United States.
The action.of the Egyptian government in
presenting to jtlje city of New York one of
the ancient obelisks, which possess such
historic interest, is highly appreciated as a
generous mark of international regard. If
prosperity should attend the enterprise of
its tranaportation across the Atlantic, its
erection iu a conspicuous position in the1
chief commercial city of tbe nation will
soon be accomplished.
The treaty recently made between Japan
and the United Suttee, in regard lo the re
vision of former commercial treaties, it ia
now believed, will be followed by similar
aetion on the part of other treaty powers.

It is a gratification to rouble to announo
that, through the judicious and energetic
action of the militarv commanders oi u,H
two nations on each side of the Kio Grande
under the instructions of their respective
governments, raids and depredations hHVn
greatly decreased, and, in the localitjri

as would endanger the peace of the tWlJ

earnestly commend to the wisdom of con
gress the provision of suitable
legislation
looking to this result.
Diplomatic intercourse with Colu ubia i*
again fully restored by the arrival of a min
uter from that country to the United Statm
This is especially fortunate in view of the
fact that the question of an inler-occanic
canal has rectnily assumed anew and im
portant aspect, and is now under discusition
with the Central American countries through
whose territory the canal, by the Nicaragua
route, would have to pass. It is trusted tlmi
enlightened statesmanship on their part will
see that the early prosecution of such a
work will largely enure to tbe benefit, not
only of their own citizens and thoee of the
United States, but of the commerce of the
civilized world. It ia not doubted that
should the work be undertaken under the
protective auspices of the United Siatec
an upon satisfactory concessions for the'
right of way, and its security, by the Central
American governments, the capital for im
completion would be readily furnished from
this country and Europe, which might, fail,
iog such guarantees, frove inacceesibie.
Diplomatic relations with Chili have alto
been strengthened by the reception of a
minister from that country.
The war between Peru, Bolivia, and Chili
still continues. Tbe United StateB have uot
deemed It proper lo interpose in the mattei
further than to convey to all tbe govern
ments concerned, tbe assurance that the
friendly offices of tbe government of the
United Stales for tha restoration of peace
upon an honorable basis will be extenued,
in case tbe belligerents shall exhibit a read
iness to sccept them.
Cordial relations continue with Brazil and
the Argentine Republic, and trade with
those countries is improving. A provision
for regular and more frequent mall commu
nication, in our own ships, between tbe
ports of this country snd the nations of
South America seems to me to deserve the
attention of congress, as sn essential pre
cursor of an enlargement of our commerce
with them, and an extension of our carrying
trade.
A recent revolution ln Venezuela has been
followed by the establishment of a provis
ional government. This government has
not yet been formally recognized, and it ia
deemed desirable to await the proposed ac

give it tbe ssnctlon of constitutional forms.
A naval vessel has been sent to the &
moan islands, to mske surveys snd take poi
session of tbe privileges ceded to tbe United
States by Ssmos, in the harbor of Pseo Pa

there, which will be convenient snd useful
to United States vessels.
The subject of opening diplomatic rela
tione with Roumania and Seryia, now be
come independent sovereignties, is at pres
ent under consideration, and is the subject
of diplomatic correspondence.
There is a gratifying incresse of trade
with nearly sll Europesn and American
countries, and it is believed that with judi
cious action in regard to its development it
csn ond will be still more enhanced, and
tbat American products snd manufacture!
will find new snd expending markets. Tbe
reports of dipiomstic and consular officers
upon this subject, under tbe svstem now
sdopted, have resulted in obtaining mucb
valuable information, which has been and
will continue to be Isid before congress and
the public from time to time.
