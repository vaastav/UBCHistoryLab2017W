SEWS SUMMARY
OF THE CAPITAL
Sixty-Second Congress Convenes and
Session Will Likely Run Well
Into the Summer.
1923 BUDGET IS SUBMITTED
President, in Person, Delivers An-
nual Message to Senate and
House in Joint Session.
The sixty-second congress convened
at noon on Monday for its first regular
session. Ten days only had elapsed
since the adjournment of the extra
session, and it was generally predict
ed that the session convening on Mon
day would run well into next summer
as a tremendous amount of work con
fronts the two houses. The program
for the day was brief. President
Harding- sent the first national budget
for the fiscal year 1923 to congress. It
provides for an expenditure of $3,505,-
745,727, or approximately $500,000,-
000 below the figure which had been
estimated as the minimum of govern
ment expenditures.
President Harding's annual message
to congress was delivered by him in
person to the house and senate in joint
session at 12:30 p. m. on Tuesday.
President Harding will refuse to re
ceive delegations urging recognition of
Ireland at this time, he made clear
in Monday in a letter to Senator Atlee
Pomcrene of Ohio.
A general reduction of 10 per cent
in all freight rates on products of
farms, orchards, gardens and ranges
were ordered Saturday by the inter
state commerce commission. The re
duction is in accordance with a recent
proposal of the railroads that rates "be
cut for an experimental period of six
months as a substitute for the recent
order of the commission reducing
rates on hay and grain 16 per cent.
The cut in rates will save millions to
farmers and livestock breeders and
will be passed down in a large meas
ure to the consumers. The action of
the commission suspends the recent
rate cut of lfi per cent on hay and
grain and their products, but brings
these under the general reduction.
Action on the proposed modifications
in grades of spring wheat now under
consideration in the department of ag
riculture, if any are made, will be
promulgated by Secretary of Agricul
ture Henry C. Wallace until between
March 1 and 15. The secretary now
has before him the report of John Lee
Coulter recommending radical changes
in the grades which were urged by
Representative Halvor Steenerson and
officials of the grain inspection ser
vice in Minnesota. In his report Mr.
Coulter urges changes which he be
lieves would permit the grower a
financial return on the wheat he of
fers to the buyer that is, if the grain
would grade No. 1.
In an attempt to render practical
service to distressed families search
ing vainly for some member who has
disappeared the postoffice department,
contrary to its estableshed precedent
in refu^inu to give out addresses, will
become a port of missing men, seeking
to put its machinery at the disposal of
such families. The facilities of the
postoffice, with its organization reach
ing into every corner of the land, is
offered for this purpose.
The department of labor has 68 la
bor disputes pending. Some of these
have been in existence for many
months and others are new disputes.
Fifteen of the number are merely dif
ferences. Fifty-three are open strikes.
Limitation of land armaments has
faded from the picture as a topic of
fruitful discussion at the conference,
according to a judgment of the situa
tion expressed by Signor Schanzer,
Italy's chief spokesman at Washing
ton. Even if France were willing to
throw the whole question of land
forces on the table, the Italian rep
resentatives arc unconvinced practical
reductions could be effected unless all
the military nations of continental
Europe were included or careful scru
tiny given to their armies.
Road Building in 1921.
Road building has recovered from
the setback received during the war,
and prospects are bright for the fu
ture. Approximately 14,000 miles of
road have been constructed during the
present season by the states in con
innction with federal aid, according to
the bureau of public roads, United
States department of agriculture, and
probably an equal amount independent
of federal aid. More miles of im
proved road have been built than dur
ing any other year.
Costs of road grading and construc
tion with local materials is down prac
tically to the 1914 level. Some reduc
tions, also, have been made in freight
rates on road materials. The impor
tance of this item is shown by the fact
that in some cases it has been estimat
ed that increased freight rates have
added 10 per cent to the cost of
a road. Prices of manufactured road
materials tend downward, the present
level is materially lower than that of a
year ago.
With the new appropriation by con
gress of $75,000,000 added impetus
will be given to new road construction.
Many of the state are considering en
larged amounts of state aid, and the
new law will have a tendancy to en
courage this policy. It will also se
cure the construction of a system of
interstate and intercounty highways
rather than haphazard selection of
roads as in some cases in the past.
The meeting of the state highway
officials of the country, now being held
in Omaha, Neb., and which will close
on December 12, is being devoted
largely to the discussion of ways and
means" of complying with the new
federal law by getting contsruction
under way.
INDIANS CAPTURED.
Officers of the Law Gather in Sam
Brothers, Charged With Murder
of Sliman, a Peddler.
Sheriff Shockley and John Poole, his
deputy, assisted by Sheriff Boekenoog
en of Aitkin county and one of his
deputies captured Ole and George
Sam, two of the Indians charged with
the murder of Joseph G. Slima, at 2
a. m. last Saturday morning. Shock
ley discovered their whereabouts some
days previous and, with the other of
ficers named, drove from Aitkin to
Sandy lake, about 30 miles distant.
The Indians were located in a shack
occupied by another Indian and his
squaw on a peninsula which extends
into Sandy lake. The officers ap
proached this shack and an old Indian
opened the door and came out. As he
did so Shockley rushed in, followed by
the others. There the two Sams were
discovered in a back room playing
cards, each having a loaded shotgun
beside him. They were overpowered
before given an opportunity to use
their weapons, manacled and driven to
Aitkin, where they were placed in jail.
Sheriff Shockley and John Poole ar
rived in Princeton with the prisoners
on Saturday afternoon, and on Monday
they were arraigned before Justice
King and charged with murder in the
first degree. They waived examina
tion and were conveyed to the Henne
pin county jail to await the action of
the grand jury at the next term of
the Mille Lacs district court. The
story of the murder of Sliman ap
peared in a previous issue of the
Union.
Mrs. George Broze.
Mrs. W. H. Gebert received a tele
gram last week conveying the infor
mation that Mrs. Geo. Broze died in
Minneapolis form heart disease on
November 29. Her maiden name was
Linda Vogel, daughter of Mr. and Mrs.
Fred Vogel, formerly of Brickton.
Her parents now live at Howard Lake.
She was born October 29, 1894, and,
besides here parents, is survived by
her husband, brothers and sisters.
The many friends of the family ex
tend sympathy.
Mr. and Mrs. W. H. Gebert and Mrs.
A. Nocske attended the funeral last
Friday.
TO BE GRAVELED.
Contract for Surfacing Trunk High
way Between Zimmerman and
Elk River Let for $16,753.
Official information from the state
highway department says that the 10-
milo section of trunk highway No. 18,
"between Zimmerman and Elk River,
will be gravel-surfaced at a cost of
$16,753.27 under a tentative contrr.ct
award by Commissioner Babcock to
Winston Bros, of Minneapolis, this
firm being the lowest bidder.
This is one of the 44 projects for
350 miles of graveling and 25 mil^s of
paving on the first group of winter
jobs to speed needed highway im
provements and relieve unemploy
ment. On each project large savings
were made in consequence of the low
nature of the bids due to wide compe
tition. Gravel surfacing was let at
an average of $2,000 a mile, and yard
mile haul at 16 to 30 cents compared
with 30 to 60 cents last season. The
lowest bid on the single paving project
was $2.17 a yard for concreteabout
20' per cent, or more than $5,000 a
mile, under the regular season figures
of $27,000.
Applications for work should be
made directly to contractors as no
hiring ig being done by the highway
department.
Village Council Meets.
The village council met last night,
with all members in attendance, and
disposed of such business as came be
fore it.
Fred Mankc appeared before the
council and stated that the fire de
partment was in need of 10 pair of
boots, 6 cor.ts, 6 smoke respirators nd
a nozzle for the chemical engine. Upon
motion the recorder was instructed to
write to manufacturers .Mid obtain
prices for the material required.
Louis Wicen asked the council to
grant him an additional $25 in conse
quence of culverts costing him that
much more than he estimated. No ac
tion was taken.
T. F. Scheen, in behalf of the village
commission, requested the council to
fake the necessary measures with the
Elk River Power & Light company to
have the Princeton plant put in re
pair. It was decided to instruct the
village attorney to write the power
company to this effect.
The. auditing of a batch of bills con
cluded the work of the session.

Ellenbaum-Zieroth.
A romance of nearly four years
came to an end last Tuesday when
Miss Martha Zieroth, daughter of Mr.
and Mrs. Charles Zieroth, was united
in marriage to J. Lind Ellenbaum,
youngest son of Mrs. J. Ellenbaum, in
the Methodist church in this city.
The bride wore a beautiful white
gown of pussywillow taffeta and
georgette and was attended by the
groom's sister, Miss Mary Ellenbaum,
who wore a blue dress of the same ma-
tenal, The groom was attendee by
Charles Zieroth, brother of the 'bride.
Mrs. Ellenbaum has grown to wo-,
manhood in this community and has
always been considered among the
most popular girls in her circle of as
sociates. Her pleasant disposition has
won for her an unlimited number of
friends.
The groom, who is also a product of
the Princeton community, is a young
man of good habits, honest and in
dustrious, whose ambitions turn to
agriculture and, as a result, the newly
weds will begin housekeeping at once
on the farm formerly operated by
Frank Pohl, two and v. half miles north
of Princeton.
Following the wedding a reception
was held at the Ellenbaum home,
which was attended by nearly a hun
dred relatives and friends. The bride
was the recipient of many lovely gifts,
all of which were well chosen for their
usefulness.
This young couple Will start their
future with the brightest of prospects
and the wishes of their friends for the
best a happy life affords.
Out of town guests at the wedding
were James MacWilliams of Minneap
olis, Mr. and Mrs. Herman Blethen and

and Miss E. Viola Schenck of Wahpe
ton, N. D.
Mille Lacs County's Share.
Minnesota's annual Christmas gift
to the county agricultural societies
went forward this week when R. P.
Chase, state auditor, completed the
mailing of checks to the amount of
$140,832.97, state aid to the societies.
This aid to the agricultural associa
tions of the state is directed by law
and is based on the premium paid by
various societies, the maximum basis
of prorating reimbursement to any
one society being $1,700. The largest
amount received by any .society in the
state is $1,564. The 1921 legislature
appropriated $140,000 for this pur
pose, and this, with the balance av?il
able, was divided prorata at the rate
of ninety-two cents on the dollar.
The Mille Lacs County Agricultural
society is reimbursed to the extent of
$1,564, having reported a total premi
um paid amounting to $2,187.

PRINCETON, MILLE LACS COUNTY, MINNESOTA, THURSDAY, DECEMBER 8, 1921
PARENTS HOLD MEETING.
Mass Meeting Held to Discuss Orga
nization of Parent-Teach-
ers' Association.
Monday evening a mass meeting
was held in the high school auditorium
to discuss the prospect' oi organizing
a "parent-teachers' association in
Princeton. A large representation of
the good people of Princeton and the
vicinity and a number of teachers were
present. The meeting opened with
community singing led by Mr. Ames
assisted by Miss Snyder at the piano.
Brief talks were given by Miss
Barskey, Superintendent Hall, Mr. Mc
Millan and Rev. Besselievre. Miss
Barskey reported there are already
four parent-teachers' associations in
the countyIsle, Wahkon, Foreston
and Milaca each having such an
organization. The associations at
Wahkon and Foreston have just been
organized recently, but the ones at
Isle and Milaca have been established
for some time and in both cases have
proved to be of much benefit to the
community. There are 50 members in
Isle and 100 in Milaca. Miss Barskey
states that usually the program, which
is presented to both the parents and
teachers, is followed by a social hour.
This latter feature of the meetings is
most important as it furnishes an op
portunity for the parents and teach
ers to become acquainted. As Miss
Barskey stated, the teachers find they
can work to much better advantage
with the pupils if they meet their par
ents occasionally and have an oppor
tunity to discuss the school work with
them.
Mr. McMillan and Rev. Bescselievre,
speaking in behalf of the parents, em
phasized the fact that every parent
should feel it his duty to follow the
progress of his children in school and
to become acquainted with the teachers
who are instructing them.
A motion was made to form a tem
porary organization, with Mr. Hall
acting as chairman, until a permanent
organization could be effected. Rev.
Lumb, Rev. Besselievre and Superin
tendent Hall were appointed as a com
mittee to draw up the by-laws and the
constitution for the association to be
formed. It was voted to meet on the
evening of Tuesday, December 13, to
form a permanent organization. It is
expected there will be a larger atten
dance at the next meeting and that a
.strong organization will be formed at
that time.

PROGRAM IN ARMORY.
Program to be Presented This Even
ing Under Auspices of the
American Legion.
This week the American legion is
co-operating with the national educa
tional association in conducting a cam
paign to emphasize the importance of
education. The members of the legion
believe that the standard of American
citizenship can be raised only through
education. The legion has adopted
quite an elaborate program of Ameri
canization for the year 1922. It advo
cates the need of more schools and bet
ter schools, a higher grade of teachers
which can be obtained only by paying
higher salaries and the teaching, in the
schools, of the fundamental principles
of good citizenship. The legion re
quests that all the teachers in the
secondary schools be American citi
zens.
Those members of the legion who
served overseas and received their bap
tism of fire returned to their native
country with an increased respect for
education. They had found that the
educated man made the gamest kind
of a fighter. Brigadier General Catlin,
who commanded the sixth regiment of
marines at Belleau Wood, made the
following statement:
When the final showdown comes,
when the last ounce of strength and
nerve is called for. when mind and
hand must act like lightning together,
I will take my chances with an educat
ed man, a free-born American with a
trained mind. Unquestionably the in
telligent, educated man makes, in the,
long run, the best soldier.
The Fremont Woodcock post has se
cured an excellent speaker to deliver
the address this evening, R. H. Coma
ford of the Mark Hamilton post in
Minneapolis. Everyone is cordially in
vited to attend the program. No ad
mission will be charged.

"It is important for applicants to
remember that the 1921 registration
certificate, or a sworn statement in
case it has been lost, must be sent in
with the application for 1922 registra
tion and license," said Secretary Holm,
"Duplicate certificates can be had from
this office by making a sworn -state
ment of ownership and paying the 25
cent fee required by law."
Secretary Holm reports that regis
tration of motor vehicles for 1921 is
nearly ended, but that lack of funds
among some and lack of inclination
on the part of others is causing some
delay.
A PLEASING CONCERT.
ImmanueFs Lutheran Band Wins Lau
rels by Its Excellent Rendi
tion of Program.
The band of Immanuel's Lut'ieran
church gave a most pleasing concort at
the armory on Tuesday evening and a
large audience greeted the performers.
An excellent program had been pre
pared by Rev. Vogel, director of the
organization, and not a hitch was de
tected in its rendition. There were 13
numbers on the program and these
were augmented oy un additional se
lection, rendered by request. It would
be difficult to discriminate as to the
degree of merit of the various rendi
tions, so excellently were each of them
presented. The concert, however, in
cluded a semi-musical comedy which
is worthy of special mention. It was
entitled, "The Dumb Musician," in
which a tramp (Ted Heitman)
had been arrested, charged with
vagrancy. When questioned by
the justice of the peace (Henry
Wilhelm), the dumb tramp answered
all questions by playing a few
bars of various songs on his cor
net. For instance, when asked his
birthplace, he played "My Maryland,"
and so forth. The justice was so im
pressed with the tramp's ability that
he pr.sscd the hat in court to assist
him. Then there was the cornet solo
of Rev. Vogel, with an encore, played
with much ability. Mrs. Vogel was
the accompanist.
Anent Auto License Tags.
New 1922 motor vehicle licenses, on
sale January 3, Mike Holm, secretary
of state, announced this week, can be
issued lawfully on 1921 and older cars
only after taxes are paid in full The
statement is intended to correct a com
mon mistake that it was not necessary
in -1921 to register cars not in use or I will also discuss methods of spraying.
'*&" ")$&^Mt&fa&jNk
Rev. Vogel organized his band, con
sisting of 16 pieces, last June, and at
that time many of the boys could not
sound a note on their instruments.
Monday night's concert demonstrrted
the rapid strides these young nvsn
have made and shows what untiring
work has been necessary on the part
of the director to bring them up to
their present stage of proficieney.
We can say for ourselves that the
concert was a veritable musical t/ea*
and wc can confidently speak for the
audience from the resounding applnuss
which followed every number.
The people of Princeton, we feel
sure, would welcome more concerts by
Immanuel's Lutheran band. Such ex
cellent productions as that of Monday
night tends to take the rough edge off
life's humdrum and dispels grouchi
ness.
MINNESOTA CROP SHOW.
Sixteen Organizations Co-operate in
Exhibition of Vegetables,
Grains, Fruits, Etc.
The Minnesota crop show, which will
open in the assembly room of the
court house in Minneapolis on Decem
ber 13 and continue until December
16, will doubtless be well worth at
tending. Sixteen organizations are
co-operating in putting on this show.
There will be exhibits of vegetables,
grains, fruits and flowers in large
variety.
One of the principal features will be
the state exhibit of the Boys' and
Girls' Potato club, in which $300 in
cash prizes will be awarded. A silver
trophy will be given to the entrant
having the best display of potatoes in
the contest. The potato club boy
from each county who is 15 years old
or over who makes the best record in
the contest will have all expenses paid
to the 1922 state fair.
Because of recognized climatic dif
ferences in Minnesota the state will be
divided into three districtsnorthern,
central and southernand exhibitors
will compete only with others in their
section of the state.
A Request.
The rural mail carries kindly ask
their patrons to install boxes about
30 inches long, 18 inches wide and 16
inches high, either individually, or,
where a group of boxes are established
on a corner, collectively, so as to
avoid congestion and obviate delay in
delivery of parcel post packages.
When carriers place big packages on
top of the ordinary mail boxes they
are ofttimes blown off by the wind
into the mud or snow and damaged.
It is to prevent these conditions that
the carriers suggest parcel post boxes
be installed.
Farm Bureau Units Will Meet.
Two interesting meetings are sched
uled for the Greenbush and Princeton
township units on December 13 and 14.
The Greenbush unit will meet at Fred
Erickson's farm on Tuesday at 1:30
p. m. The following day at the same
hour the Princeton unit meets at Wal
ter Mark's farm.
Mr. Rose, who has had much experi
ence in raising potatoes, wiil address
both meetings. He will explain a
method of treating seed potatoes so
they will not suffer from disease and

ANNUAL MEETING
OF FARM BUREAU
Officers of County Association Elect-
ed for Coming Year by the
Board of Directors.
250 MEMBERS ARE PRESENT
McKerrow Speaks on Central Co-op
erative Commission Association
McGuire Delivers Address.
The Mille Lacs County Farm Bu
reau association held its annual meet
ing in the auditorium of the Milaca
high school Saturday afternoon. Ap
proximately 250 members were pres
ent. Everyone seemed to be enthusi
astic and much interested in the work
of the organization.
Louis W. Normandin, president of
the association presided. All the units
in the county, except one, had elected
their officers for the coming year. The
directors from these 14 units elected
the officers of the county association.
The list of township units, the number
of their members, and their directors
is given below:
Unit Director No. Members
East Side, Geo. Freer 19
Isle Harbor, R. W. Richardson 11
iSouth Harbor, C. L. Freer 34
South Isle Harbor 25
Kathio, Wm. Anderson 9

Pease, H. B. Boos
Milo, Nels Sederquist 56
Greenbush, L. W. Normandin 101
Princeton, Wm. Gebert 54
Total 555
It should be noted the members in
Page chose a woman as their direc
tor and they should be commended for
the good judgment they displayed in
so doing. The women are taking an
active interest in the farm bureau and
it is fitting that at least one woman
should serve on the board of directors.
The following officers were elected by
the unanimous vote of the board of
directors: President, Louis W. Nor
mandin vice president, Sam Droogs
ma secretary-treasurer, Wm. Gebert
county director to state federation, C.
L. Freer members at large of the
executive board, Mrs. Wahlfors, Geo.
Hatch and P. E. Anderson.
Mr. Normandin made a few remarks
in accepting the office of president of
the association for another year. He
modestly stated that he believed there
was other material in the county that
would furnish better presidential tim
ber and accepted the re-election only
because he was perhaps in closer touch
with the association at the present
time than some of the other men.
Mr. Normandin has certainly worked
most zealously for the Farm Bureau
association and has made an excellent
president.
County Agent Hammargren gave a
brief review of his work in the county
and the activities of the association
during the past eight months, which
report is published elsewhere in this
issue.
Mr. Normandin then introduced the
principal speaker of the afternoon,
W. A. McKerrow, manager of the Cen
tral Co-operative Livestock Shipping
association. Mr. McKerrow delivered
a most interesting address and made
a very favorable impression on the
audience. He stated that while ef
ficient production is still a question of
importance, th.e American farmer
realizes that he must now devote some
attention to the marketing of his
produce if agriculture is to'' be a prof
itable industry. Minnesota has be
come a leader in co-operative market
ing enterprises and the' most success
ful of these are our 611 co-operative
creameries which produce the best
butter in the United States.
In discussing his subject Mr. Mc
Kerrow said in part: In considering
any co-operative enterprise, the first
thing to decide is, is the principle
correct? If it is, the people interest
ed in the project should shoulder their
share of responsibility and not with
hold their support until the organiza
tion is firmly established and running
smoothly. The Central Co-operative
Livestock association was organized
because the farmers in the state felt
there as need of such an organiza
tion. It is the largest co-operative
livestock organization in this country
and probably any other country.
This farmers' co-operative commission
handles 85 per cent of the stock going
to South St. Paul. The commission
started with a small capital, $1,000.
It started with the most strenuous op
position from the 35 commission firms
that were already doing business in
the South St. Paul market, but thanks
to the method of organization and the
support accorded by the local shipping
associations throughout the state the
Central continued to develop and its
volume of business increased each
successive month. The central opened
for business on August 8. From that
date to September 1, we handled 440
cars of livestock, nearly as great a
volume as that handled by any two of
the 35 firms doing business on the
market. During the next month wc
received 721 cars or three times as
many as the largest number handled
by any other one firm. Next month
