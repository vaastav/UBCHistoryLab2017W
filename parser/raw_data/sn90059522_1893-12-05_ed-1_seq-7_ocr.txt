Chicago, Dec. 4.— The visible supply
report was disastrous to the bull inter
ests today. After* opening higher and
advancing %c, wheat took a downward
shoot and landed with May but jkc
higher, and December %c better thau
Saturday's closing prices. Corn was
steady and closed without noteworthy,
change. Provisions were firm and very
quiet. The Dullish sentiment which
prevailed at the close of Saturday's
trading was still manifest at today's
opening, and wheat began the day
higher. The commission houses were
well supplied with buying orders, and
Liverpool markets were quoted steady.
London and French country markets
were also reported firm, and receipts at
Minneapolis and Duluth were but 746
cars, compared with 1,201 cars the
preceding Monday, and 1,332 cars on
the corresponding day last year. Under
these favorable conditions prices were
advanced, and the bears retired for a
time, while the bulls made unkind re
marks regarding a well-known fur
bearing animal said to be afflicted with
a sore head. The general impression
among traders was that today's visible
supply report would show a decrease of
at least 500,000 bu, and this was a de
cided bull influence, further aiding the
advance. Prices held steady until the
anxiously awaited report was received,
and then the bears had their inning.
Tne visible supply showed, an increase
of -08,000 bu, ana immediately took a
fail out of prices. The decline fora
lew minutes was rapid, but was arrested
for a time by reports of remarkably
light Indian shipments. Closing cables
were irregular, Paris quoting a decline,
and prices went down to the close. May
opened at 69;£c advanced H,c, then a c.
lost - 4 c. gained '-._:, lost %c, dropped
*4'e, sold off %<-•, and rallied > 6 c to close,
at 6'J^c.
Offerings and demand were light in
the corn pit, and little business was
transacted. May opened unchanged at
40. I sc advanced '"*,c on better Liverpool
quotations and the bulge in wheat, lost
}.c with the weakness in wneat, and
rallied yic to close where it had opened.
Continued dullness was the only feat
ure in the oats market. May opened
unchanged at 31?sC, advanced }Sc in
sympathy with com, and closed at the
opening "figure. _^__§
Provisions were dull. The opening
was at a slight advance on lighter hog
receipts than the estimate. Buying by
the Anglo-American Packing company
and Sain Wolf sent prices : up a trifle,
but, with lack* of demand, most of the
gain was lost. As compared with Sat
urday uignt, January pork is-2-Zc higher,
January lard 10j higher, and" Jauuary
ribs 6V£c higher.
Lake business is over for the season.
The last charier was at 3 .c to load and
hold wheat in Buffalo. Kail rates were
easy at 30c per 100 pounds for flour and
grain to New York.
Estimated receipts for tomorrow :
"Wheat, 130 cars; corn. 340 cars; oats,
170 cars; hogs. 27,000.

Dn.T th. Minn., Dec 4.— The wheat
market opened strong this morning at
JiC higher than Saturday for cash and
f.n higher for May. The" early market
ruled firm with advancing tendencies.
There was a good trading in cash,* and
Che market was cleaned up at the out
side figures. There was a premium of
fie on soft stuff lor wheat to arrive and
delivered at nulls. May .wheat advanced
up to 11 o'clock on good trading and
pained I.e. -The posting of the visible
at neon, showing increase where de
crease was expected, weakened the
market and after that it was very dull
and prices declined. The close" was

New York, Dec. There was
nothing left this morning of the firm
ness with which the stock market closed
on Saturday. On the contrary, the
speculation was weak, and sympathized
with the heaviness of the London mar
ket for American securities. The pub
lication of the president's message in
Loudon in advance of its delivery to
congress, gave the street a knowledge
of its contents through the medium of
the cable, and the fact that it made no
mention of a contemplated bond issue
was regarded as a bear point, and
helped to depreciate values. The No
vember statement or the St. Paul road
coming in with a large decrease in
earnings, was another factor in the
general depression. London, too, was
in the market as a seller of St. Paul,
Atchison, Union Pacific, and Louisville
& Nashville, and the West . sent
in a . number of selling orders
which added to the volume of stock
offered by the bears who renewed their
operations at the opening of the ex
change. General Electric gave way, the
most being heavily sold for the Boston
account on the plea that the current
price is above the intrinsic merit of the
stock. After a break of 33£ per cent the
shares were in better demand and a re
covery of 1% per cent was effected, of
which }_ per cent was lost at the close.
Sngar, while most prominent in the'
transactions, was held within narrower
fluctuations than on any day of late.
After an early decline of % per cent the
stock rose 1 : 4 per cent, then receded
1 ... recovered 1 and reacted }£ Der cent.
Tne general market opened a" fraction
lower and in the early dealings a decline
was recorded ranging from }i to 2 per
cent, the latter Western Union. which
was sold to realize the profits of the ad
vance. Pullman and* Lead preferred
dropped 2 per cent. Lead common
1-., and Lake Shore, Burlington &
Quincy and New Jersey Central 1 per
cent. Wheeling & Lake Erie preferred,
which had advanced 2% per cent- in the
early sales, reacted 1% per ceut. Before'
11 o'clock the pressure to sell was re
moved, and an improvement was re
corded ranging from i 4 to 2 per cent,
the latter in Louisville, Distilling and
lowa Central preferred being also
prominent therein. Subsequently a free
selling movement was developed, which
spread to almost the entire list, and a
downward movement was inaugurated,
wqich was not checKed until a decline
of Z'flMi per cent had been recorded,
Louisville, New Albany and New
Jersey Central in the lead. A quick
turn was made before noon on the
bull side of the market, Chicago
Gas selling up lf 0 . Mobile & Ohio 2,
and the rest of the list 3.®% per cent.
After midday, the speculation again be
came heavy, and during the * afternoon
the dealings were very irregular and
rallies and reactions followed in quick
succession. In the late dealings the
market became steadier.and at the close
THE SAINT PAUL DAILF GLOBE: Tt'EFDAT MORNING. DECEMBER 5. ?833.
was fairly firm. Compared with the
closing sales of Saturday, the -last quo
tations today are decidedly irregular.
Cotton Oil preferred is 3^c lower; pre
ferred Lead, 2; Western Union, V . :
Lake Shore, 1-*, and Pullman, Pacific

at 40. ag dust 45 on Nov. 22.
There was considerable activity in
the bond market, but there was an ab
sence of that firmness which character
ized the dealings during last week. The
tendency during the greater part of the
day was toward lower figures, but
toward the close a slightly stronger
tone prevailed.and some issues recorded
an advance. The principal changes lor
the day were: Tennessee Coal A iron.

! The Post says: Business in stocks was
light this morning, the common expla
nation bting the wish of speculators to I
see the president's message before re
suming activity. When the message
was published, trading became more
dull than ever -a natural consequence
enough, since the document, both in its-.
positive recommendations and in. its
conservative tone was precisely what
had been expected. Such declines as
there were in today's prices took place
as a rule before the publication of the
message, and arose chiefly from mod
erate realizing sales. Tlie afternoon
market . was firm throughout, lt was
the reported decrease in St. Paul's
gross earnings which started the fore
noon selling, and the sales were partici
pated in by last week's speculative buy
ers aud by London, in London's mar
ket the only development worth notic
ing was the sudden drop in the call
money rate, promptly reflected by lower
sterling rales here and in Paris.
Chicago Gas and Distilliug certificates
scored sharp advances.
At present all the Wall street dabblers
in the stock believe implicitly that the
Distilling company always, carries an
enormous manufactured surplus, aud
that the more the trade is taxed the
larger will be its profits.
