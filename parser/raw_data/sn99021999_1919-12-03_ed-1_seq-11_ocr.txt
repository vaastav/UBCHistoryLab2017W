The ccjal shortage restrictions are
being observed to the letter in the
, Exchange building at the stock
yard. Offices do not open until 10,
and close promptly at 3:30.
According to President Everett
Buckingham of the stockyards com
pany, cattle receipts are nearly nor
mal for this time of the year, there
being 645 cars of livestock received
Tuesday, which is but a few cars
short of the number received last
year.
"We are certainly saving on the
consumption of coal," said Presi
dent Buckingham, "with the hopes
that the situation will be cleared
up soon. We are practicing the
strictest economy and making every
shovelful of ,coal count."
It was announced Tuesday that
there is no danger of any of the
local packing plants being compelled
to shut down for at least two weeks.
They have enough coal and oil on
hand, or on tracks, to keep their
houses in operation for that time.
Housewives Plan to
: Battle With Alleged
Milk Profiteering
:
Housewives of the South Side
are up in arms over the advance,
this week, in the price of milk and
a movement is being organized
among the women to reduce the
consumption of milk to a minimum.
Miss Helen Miller is endeavoring:
to organize the housewives of the
Sputh Side to fight the alleged
profiteering in milk, which has been
raised by a number of dairies to 10
cents a pint
It. is planned for a number of con
sumers to pool tpgether and get
their milk from farmers in Sarpy
county, close to the South Side.
Miss Miller stated Tuesday that the
price of milk had not been raised
to the i grocers and bakeries, but
that consumers on milk routes are
now being compelled to pay 19
cetnts a quart, or 10 cents a pint.

Cattle Receipts today were estimated
at 11,80(1 head, which, together with 1.1,
800 head yesterday, brings the total for
the two days up to 26,600, which is nearly
13,000 less than for the corresponding time
Inst week and also slightly less than for
the same time last year.
There was quite a sprinkling of short fed
steers this morning, but the quality as a
whole was not as good as yesterday and
prices were about steady all aroond. Al
though the market on butcher stock was
not 'as active as yesterday, still trans,
actons were being completed early, aad as
a whole prices were steady to 1016c
stronger in spots. The market showed
seme unevenness, the opinions differing
considerably in different parts of the
yards.
Good stockers an, feeders were steady,
while there was a slighter market for the
light, thin kinds. Supply of western beef
was rather light, but what there was sold
at prices unchanged from yesterday.

' New York. Dec. i. Reflecting tha un
usual ana diverse events wnicn influenced
Its course, the session of the stock ex
change today waa dull, with many eon
fusing and irregular changes of prices.
Adoption by the government of stringent
regulations to prevent coal famine, an
other collapse In foreign exchange, the
sudden death ot H. C. Frlck and the
president's message to congress aug
mented the uncertainties which previously
had obscured the fnanclal horizon.
Aa a market factor the president's com
munication took precedence. Disappoint
ment was expressed in many quarters at
the absence of specific reference to
remedial railroad legislation. This was
partly offset by recommendations for the
protection of various home industries.
Advices from principal manufacturers
sought to amend the fuel restrictions, but
It was not denied that further curtailment
of production and transportation would
Inevitably result.
Latest aspects of the Mexican situation,
which were distinctly beneficial to the oil
shares and 6 per cent call money rate,
which held throughout the session, were
almost the only developments which fa
vored trading and these lost some of their
foice In the later dealings.
So far as the stock market moved at
all, fluctuations were limited to sueh
speculative favorites as General Motors,
petroleums, equipments and leathers.
Gains of 1 to 3 points among Investment
rails were materially shaded at the steady
to firm close. Sales amounted to 876,000
shares.
In the bond market, where dealings In
Liberty issues were again very large on a
declining tendency, the noteworthy feature
was the strength of the local tractions.
International bonds reflected only mod
erately the further demoralized movement
In exchange.
Total sales, par value, aggregated 828,
750,000. Old United States bonds were
unchanged on call.

Chicago Cirain and Provisions. '
Chicago, Dec. 2. Fresh advances In
the corn market today resulted largely
from the fact that receipts here were di
minishing fast and that the visible sup
ply total was one of the smallest on rec
ord. Prices closed strong, 2H3c net
higher, with December $1.41 1.41 and
May t. 361-35V Oats gained 2U6
2Sc and provisions 22l$70c.
It did not take long for the corn mar
ket to respond to the scarcity of supplies
snd to the Indications that owing to
shortage of coal and to lack of sufficient
cars no adequate enlargement of arrivals
here this month seemed probable. Al
though at the start some hesitancy was
shown because of severe breaks' In for
eign exchange and also because of lower
quotations on hogs, corn prices soon began
to move rapidly up grade.
Bullish sentiment was further empha
sized by gossip that the Edge bill to fi.
nance foreign business might become a

Cleveland Lawyer Studies
Omaha Municipal Affairs
Fred E. Wirtshafter, member of
the Cleveland, (O.) bar association,
while visiting in Omaha, is taking
notes of municipal affairs, particu
larly as they relate to public serv
ice corporations.
"In Cleveland," he said, "we have
a traction commissioner, appointed
by the mayor and council, whose
duty it is to represent the city in
all matters pertaining to traction
service, lhis appointee is a higti
grade man and he is paid a salary
accordingly. He has to iron out
many problems which otherwise
might be perplexing. He gives his
entire time to the work and at all
times he is" in close touch with the
situation. He knows just what serv
ice the companies are siving the
city and he knows the traction busi
ness from a practical point of view.
We believe that this is money well
spent when we pay him $7,500 a
year. The idea has been success
ful and I believe other cities would
be pleased with this sort of an ar
rangement."

MEETING PLACF.
December 10 Meeting of
American League Magnates
May Be Held in Chicago
Or New York.
New York, Dec. 2. The question
as to whether the annual meeting of
the American league and its board of
directors shall be held in Chicago or
this city December 10 will probably
be decided here Thursday. This
was announced at the adjourned spe
cial meeting of the majority of the
directors, attended by Messrs. Co
miskey, Ruppert and Frazee. Presi
dent B. B. Johnson and J. C. Dunn
of the Cleveland club were not pres
ent. '
Attorney for President Johnson,
who yesterday asked a postpone
ment until Monday for a hearing on
the order of injunction restraining
him from holding the meeting at
Chicago asked that the hearing be
moved forward to Thursday, De
cember 4. The attorneys of ,the
New York club were instructed' to
agree to the change in order that the
opportunity be given the club own
ers to reach either city in ample
time to attend the meeting,
A resolution was passed authoriz
inar Mr. Ruppert to make such ar
rangements as might be necessary
for the holding ot the meeting here
in accordance with the original res
olution of November 19, subject to
the court decision. Ruppert also re
ported the work of the American1
league1 committee appointed to rec
ommend a new chairman for the na
tional commission as virtually nil,
due to President Johnson's refusal
to meet the committee if Ruppert
was present, and the National
league members refusal to partici
pate in such meeting unless he was
present.

of 1,011 miles and one lap, made by
Goullet and Grenda in 1914. The
French team of Tiberghien and
Chardon was one lap behind the
others. One pair, Garman and
Lang, dropped out of the race.
Goullet and Madden led in the
point score for the sprints, with 122
points. Egg and Dupuy had 101;
Bello and Thomas, 91, and Mc
Namara and Magin, 88, and Eaton
and Kaider, 72. The sprinting for
points and prizes offered by spec
tators caused the riders to ease
lip at other periods of the race
and fall far behind the records.
Western Foot Ball Has
Prestige in East From
Two Syracuse Defeats
New York, Dec. 2. Western foot
ball has won a lot of prestige as a
result of the two defeats Syracuse
has sustained at the hands of elevens
beyond the Alleghanies. Indiana
tore the tar wadding out of the Or
ange machine at Bloomington by
the score of 12 to 6, and at Lincoln
O'Neill's warriors fell before Ne
braska to the tune of 3 to 0, the de
feat being due to a field goal scored
from Syracuse's 20-yard line by
Dobson, Nebraska's captain. The
vaunted offense of the Orange could
do nothing against Nebraska's stub- j
born defense. These victories indi
cate unquestioned superiority on the
part of western elevens.
