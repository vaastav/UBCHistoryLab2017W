Home
, In spite of defeat the business major
ity in tho House has begun to do busi
ness on the same plan.
Not an Anglomaniac organ in tho land
approves the President's messa'ge, and
some of them are very ugly about it.
The British, Democratic and Angloma
niac press are three of a kind.
SnouLD the Republicans in Congress
be 6o weak as to attempt to materially
revise the new tariff law they would
show that they have been deceived by
the misrepresentations of that measure
by the free-trade press and orator.
TriE Indiaua gas-belt continnes to
gather in a new factory or two each
day, notwithstanding the carping cry of
outside newspapers that the gas will
soon be exhausted. Not half the good
wells that have been drilled are in use.
Ballot reform is all right; but the
greater reform in connection with suf
frage is to make it safe for every voter
in every precinct of the country to vote
and to make sure that his vote will be
counted. ; Some ballot reformers forget
that. " ' ' '
The fact that people all overthecoun
try are asking for copies of the tariff
law in which existing duties are com
pared with those of the old law, bodes
do good to those who spent their time,
before the election, in lying about tho
new tariff act.
The Democratic Senators disclosed
their purpose to waste time over the
election bill when they demanded the
reading of tho House bill, for which the
Senate committee had recommended an
amendment. The reading consumed the
session of Tueeday.
When Paruell and his immediate fol
lowers voted for Balfour's land bill, in
the House of Commons, yesterday, after
having denounced him and all his works
for months, he caused the enemies of
Ireland's cause to rejoice and bore testi
mony to his own insincerity.
TriE Louisville Courier-Journal says:
"A return to power of the Democrats
will open wide the door of the peni
tentiary to men high in authority in the
councils of the Republican party." It is
much more likely to open wide the.door
of the penitentiary to a lot of fellows on
the other side.
To-pay tho payment of pensions for
the last quarter of the year will be
gin. Not onty will the pressing needs
of thousands of men who deserve well
of the country be relieved, but a million
and a half dollars of money will be put
into circulation in Indiana, to the great
benefit of , general business. '
Some inartistic admirer of Senator
Voorhees placed upon his desk, the day
the session opened, a huge bouquet in
tho form of a Brahma rooster, which oc
casioned so much merrinient that tho
Senator had it removed to tho cloak
room. Tho Brahma rooster will not
fight when he can run away.
. Congress should proceed without do
lay to pass the reapportionment bill, as
the Constitution requires. The yawping
of the New York Herald and the im
pertinent meddling of Tammany should
be treated with the contempt they de
serve. They represent nothing that is
entitled to respect.
One loud, unanimous and prolonged
howl rises from Democratic throats over
the utterances of the President in favor
t)f a law to r.ecure honest elections. The
Democratic party has never been known
to nnite .in behalf of any progressive
movement, but when it comes to per
mitting allxitizens to enjoy their legal
rights it acts as ono man in opposition.
The Washington correspondents aro
reported to have been "greatly shocked"
when they discovered that the Presi
dent's message contained n real piece of
news, "something that had never oc
curred before in the history of tho gov
ernment." It is further stated that they
immediately fell to perusing the docu
ment, and it is needless to add this was
another thing which had never occurred
before in the history of the government.
The indications are that the Irish peo
ple will sustain Paruell aud virtually
compel the Irish members to acknowl
edge his leadership, or resign. If so,
this will simply be adding another blun
der to those already made. Mr. Parnell
may succeed in holding his place as
guaMeader, and perhaps can point
with pride to the indorsement of tho
Irish people, but the cause of Irish
home rule will be practically dead.
A telegram f roni Florida says thero
is already a bitter feud among the lead
ers of the Alliance now attending the
convention, growing out of tho charges
against editor Macuno and Represcnta-
tive Livingstone, of Georgia, to the
eft'ectthat they attempted to elect a rail
road lawyer to the Senate. On the other
hand, Macune and his friends chargo
that the St. Louis Globe-Democrat's dis
patch, setting forth that Macune had
made a bargain with certain railroad
magnates, was-not sent from Atlanta,
but from Washington, by the private
secretary of President Polk, of the Alli
ance. Both sides are threatening investigation.
. 'STEALING THE EHEAtY'S THUNDEE.
Not many moons hence the Democrat
ic and assistant Democratic organs do
ing business under various aliases will
be declaring in bold typo and super
heated language that the Republican
administration ran the expenditures of
tho government during the last fiscal
year up to the unprecedented figure of
$348,018,534; and, what is more, they will
present the figures to show that this sum
is many millions in excess of tho ex
penditure during previous years, after
making allowance for pensions. They
will quote the report of Secretary Win-
dom.for the fiscal year 1880 to show that
the expenditures that year were $281,
090,615. They willattemptnoexplanation
because explanation would spoil tho
whole thing for Democratic capital. The
mass of Democratic papers will not know
that thero is an explanation; the state
ment of increased expenditure is all that
they will want. But the explanation
should bo made. Heretofore the receipts
of the Postoflico Department have never
been made a part of tho revenues of the
government as accounted for by the
Treasury .Department, and all tho ex
penditures of tho Postoftice Department
fthat have appeared in tho reports of the
Secretary of the Treasury is the deficit
caused by the failure of the receipts of tho
postal servico to meet its expenses. For
instance, the expenditures of the Post
office Department being $55,000,000, and
its receipts $50,000,000, all that would
appear in the report of the Secretary of
the Treasury in years past would be the
$5,000,000 as an expenditure of public
money. But, by an act of the last Con
gress, the receipts and expenditures of
the Postoffice Department must appear
as a part of the transactions of the
Treasury Department.. Tho revenues
of tho Postoffice Department, during the
last fiscal year, were $00,882,097, but its
expenditures were $G7,852,485. Instead
of the deficit of $0,993,702 appearing in
the expenditures in the report of the
Secretary of the Treasury, as heretofore,
under miscellaneous expenditures, the
whole , revenue . and deficit appear,
adding over $60,800,000 to the apparent
expenditures of tho last fiscal year. To
mako a comparison of tho fiscal year
1890 with those of the previous fiscal
year, $G0,802,097 should first be deducted.
But the Democratic correspondent or
editor who will be quito sure to make
use of this misrepresentation will not
give away his own thunder by declaring
that it is of the sheet-iron variety.
THE EAW-MATEKIAL FALLACY.
In his able and unanswerable argu
ment for tho protection of American in
dustries the President says: "We are
under no disadvantage in any foreign
market, except that we pay our work
men and workwomen better wages than
are paid elsewhere." Nothing makes an
American free-trader madder than to be
reminded that American workmen re
ceive far higher wages than those of
European countries. It is so notoriously
true, so absolutely unanswerable and so
strong an argument in favor of protec
tion that the free-trader always gets
furious when confronted with it. The
Indianapolis Sentiuel controls itself long
enough to quote the statement, and then
says: "The veriest tyro in these matters
knows that it is the high price of raw
materials, and not tho high rates of
wages, that handicap our manufacturers
in their competition with foreign rivals
in neutral markets." President Harrison
may possibly bo "a tyro in these matters,"
and the editor of tho Sentinel, like all
other free-traders, may bo the embodi
mentof economic wisdom, butit isnover
theless true that American manufactur
ers are under no real disadvantage in com
petition; withforeign ones, except tho
higher rate of wages paid in this coun
try. .Without stepping now to inquire
as to the causes of this difference, or to
what extent it is due to protection, it is
almost exactly true, as the President
says, that "we are under no disadvantage
in any foreign market, except that we,
pay our workmen and workwomen better
wages than are paid elsewhere." The
difference in wages is at tho bottom of the
whole business, aud is tho corner-stono
of tho whole protective system. If it is
desirable to maintain the present or a
higher rate of American wages, then pro
tection is necessary; on the other hand,
if it is desirable to have our wages re
duced an 'average of 50 per cent., and
thereby equalized with tho wages paid
in Europe, then free trade is desirable.
Tho high price, of raw material cuts
no material figure in the cost of Amer
ican manufactures, cither at home or
abroad. -We have perfectly free raw
material in many lines, and in all others
so nearly free that it is a quibblo to
talk about it. We have free cotton, and
England pays freight and commissions
on tho cotton she gets from this country.
What disadvantage, then, are we under
as to cotton manufactures except higher
wages? We have free tin, and always
have had. We have absolutely free raw
material in iron, because we dig it out
of our mines. We have free hides and
skins of all kinds except sheep-skins
with tho wool on. Wo have free timber
in the raw, though thero is a duty on
sawed timber. Hard woods of all kinds
aro free, as aro a great many other
raw materials used in manufacturing.
Finally, thero is a provision in tho new
tariff law, as thoro was in the old one,
and has been for many years, providing
for a rebate or repayment of duties paid
on raw materials imported from foreign
countries aud manufactured here for
export. This provision is as follows:
That where imported materials, on which
duties havo been paid, are ust d in the man
nfacture of articles manufactured or pro
duced tn tho United States, there shall be
allowed on tho exportation of such articles
a drawback equal in amount to the duties
paid on the materials used, less 1 per ccutum
of bucb duties.
Under this provision 99 per cent, of all
duties paid by any American manufact
urer on raw material imported from
other countries and used in manufactur
ing here, will be refunded if the manu
factured articles aro exported. In view
of these facts we assert broadly, and
challenge contradiction of the state
ment, that all raw material used in man
ufacturing in this country is either ab
solutely free of duty or else comes un
der the provision of law above quoted
providing for a rebate of 99 per cent of
duties paid. The assertion that Ameri
can manufacturers are at a disadvantage
in the markets of the world by reason of
tho duty on raw materials is one of tho
free-trade fallacies taught in some col
leges and promulgated by free-trade
doctrinaires as a substitute for the truth.
It is one of the stock arguments used by
the professors of axioms and accepted
without question by the purveyors of
misinformation. "We aro at no disad
vantage in any, foreign market, except
that wo pay our workmen and work
women better wages than tire paid else
where." , -
INTERNATIONAL COPY&IQHT.
The fact that the publishers and
the prominent literary men who have
been urging the passage of a copyright
law are ultra free-traders, for the most
part, goes to prove that when it is a per
sonal matter they are, to a "man, "for
protection. In their publications and
in their writings the theory of protec
tion is denounced and its advocates are
stigmatized and ridiculed. They are
members of the Tariff-reform Club,
they fill magazines with the theories of
the Cobden Club, and have persistently
inculcated th-3 idea that men of broad
culture are free-traders, while those
who hold to protection . are men who are
influenced by greed or are incapable of
careful investigation. But when it
comes to their own business and em
ployments, no class of men were ever more
persistent and loud in their demands for
protection. They forget all their argu-.
ments for cheap food and clothing
in their urgency for a protection that
may make books more costly. In "gen
eral, they expatiate upon the free mar
kets of the world, but when it comes
their literary products they demand pro
tection in every land. Thero is justice
in their demand, and if the leading ad-,
vocates of a copyright law had not been'
persistent and offensive opponents of;
the protective policy such a lawwould
have been enacted before. The bill
which was passed yesterday is a measure
to protect American publishers jn the
publication of the works of foreign-'
authors when the governments' rbf the
nations to which these authors"jbelon(r
extend the same privilege to the.works
of American writers. It is as clearly
protective measure for the Airjericati
publishers and authors as is the present
tariff law for the manufacturer alid the5
farmer. . foil".
A RESURRECTED THEORY.'
of
It appears by the report of the- meet
ing of the governors of the Bjjard of'
Trade that when the matter of lindora
ingthe proposition to t subsidize4 ocean
steamship lines was under consiilera-,
tion, a member took occasion to remark:
that he was in favor of no otherpropo5
sition than free trade in ehipslXJintiV
what may bo called a resurrected Jhe
ory, because it has been demonstrated
that it would afford no adequate renirv
edy. A few inferior British , ships
known as ocsan tramps, might :be Jput
under tho American flag, but if Ijaxable
in any of our States where owned, that
would prevent their purchase. And if
they were purchased and put into lines"
in competition with the subsidized lines,
or thoso to which a high mail servjeo
paid, they could not compete. Besides;
the ship-builders of the United States can
build as good iron ships as can boi built
on the Clyde. "But the tariff VJnr th
materials prevents them beinp biitlag,
cheap," the eager advocate of the British-ship-building
interest will intcose,,,
There is nothing in that, so far asi ships'
intended for foreign commerce areon
cerned, since it is provided by law,tha6
all materials entering into the construc
tion of such ships may be importettfree.
of duty. The only difference-is in tho,
labor, and that is higher by from '50 to
75 per cent, in American than in British
yards. If the free-trade theory is true,
that an American workman does a third
more work in tho same time than does
his foreign competitor, tho ship for for
eign trade need cost no more, if built in
this country, than abroad. But tho
hindrance to tho maintenance of Amer
ican lines to South America and else
where is not so much in the cost of
tho ship as in' tho cost of sailing
and tho assistauco which other
governments extend to their lines.
Great Britain has paid millions
of pounds as indirect subsidies
to such lines. If the .business
will not pay, the price paid for the car
rying of mails is made so high .as to
mako it an object to support ine3. What
has our government been doing in that
direction? Nothing; we 4 have received
more money from tho receipts of ocean
mail carrlago than wo pay for tho ocean
service. If we are to have a South
American trade wo must have regular
lines of ships, owned by Americans and
not by British capitalists who will uso
our flag to servo British interests, and
tho owners of such ships must receive
from the government such bonuses, sub
sidies or extra compensation for mail
service as other governments extend to
their successful lines. Trade follows
the flat:; and the flag must represent tKo
interests of tho country to which it be
longs, and not be a disguise over Brit
ish or French ships to destroy our trade.
The foreign ship is a delusion. A few
years ago the advocates' of the foreign
ship urged the purchase of our war
ships abroad. Now, less than ten years
later, wo aro building tho best war ships
in tho world.
The New York Sun copies Postmaster
general Wnnamaker's suggestion for
postal savings banks, and says:

Will tho iun be kind enough to point
out any special provision in tho Consti
tution which authorizes tho government
togo into tho money-order business, the
postal-note business, the postage-stamp
or tho stamped - envelope business!
Without reference to tho merits of tho
suggestion for postoffice savings banks,
there is as much authority in the Con
stitution for that as there is for any of
tho other things named. The Constitu
tion was not intended to prevent prog
ress, though that is about the only ubo
the Democratic party makes of it. ,
TnE McKinley idea of preventing the im
portation of foreign goods, or making their
price so high that no one could buy them,
embodied in the platform of 1SS8, was ig
Dored utterly by Mr. Maine. . Nat
urally, he was horrified when he saw this
ill-omened McKinley bill make its appear
ance, and he did v;hat be could witn his
reciprocity amendment to take the curse
off it, Chicago Tribune!
When or where, during the campaign
of 1888, did Mr. Blaine express disap-
proval of the tariff resolution in the Chi
cago platform or of Mr. McKinley's in
terpretation of it! Never, anywhere.
Tho statement that he did is pure as
sumption and without any foundation.
Mr. Blaino could not have ignored the
McKinley idea, whatever that is, with-'
out ignoring tho Chicago platform, yet
every speech he made during tho cam
paign was devoted in great part to ex
pounding and defending the policy of
protection as formulated in the platform.
It is the height of absurdity for the
Tribune to continuo to assert what ev
erybody knows is not true. The only
criticism Mr. Blaine ever made on tho
McKinley bill was that it did not pro
vide for . reciprocity, 'and as it was
amended in that regard his criticism no
longer holds. No doubt if Mr. Blaine
were at liberty to speak he would reject
and repudiate the Tribune's attempt to
make him out an opponent of the Chi
cago platform and tho McKinley idea of
protection. If the Tribune means to be
friend Mr. Blaine he could well exclaim:
"jVb tali auxilio, nec defensorcbus istis."
The vast and comprehensive lobby
scheme suggested by President Polk, of
the Farmers' Alliance, involves an im
portant question of 'right. The only
justification of such an attempt to in
fluence legislation in favor of one class
is the fact that railroads and other large
corporations aro in the habit of paying
hired lobbyists to look after their inter
ests. Undoubtedly the farmers have
just as good a right to engage in this
spit of thing as the railroads have, or as
have the Knights of Labor, who retain a
paid lobby at Washington, but is not the
whole thing wrong? Congressmen are
elected to represent tho whole people,
and where are the rest of the people to
come in?
TnL Kansas City Times rises to re
mark that "Democracy can defeat the
contemptible purposes of a federal elec
tion bill as easily as it can dispose of a
McKinley tariff the first time the people
can change the law-makers." The "con
temptible purposes" of the federal elec
tion bill aro to secure honest elections,
and the people have not yet chosen
enough legislators of tho kind disposed
to change such measures, nor are they
likely to do so. In the meantime the
elections bill can be passed and put into
operation, and, as stated by tho Presi
dent, "its probable effectiveness is evi-.
denced by the character of tho opposi
tion that Is made to it," v
Moke than two weeks since the Super
intendent of the Census asked the Mayor
of New York, in a courteous letter, for ;
copy of the census taken by him in
October, but, receiving no reply, the
official count has been certified to the
Secretary of the Interior and sent to
Congress.' It was the purpose of tho
Superintendent, in asking the copy, to
scrutinize the list, and if the names en
tho Mayor's census could be found in.
the places to which they were credited,
to add them to the federal census. Tho
neglect of the Mayor to comply with the
request is just cause to suspect the
genuineness of hs census.
I
Secretary Windom says:
There are many grave objections to the
accumulation of a large surplus in the
treasury, and especially to the power which .
the control of such surplus gives to the
Secretary. I am sure those objections ap-
fieal to no one with so much force as to tho
iead of the department upon whom rests
the difficult and delicate responsibility of
its administration. '
Grover Cleveland' and his Secretary
of tho Treasury saw no objection to tho
policy of accumulating a surplus, and
found no difficulty in managing it. All
that was necessary was to multiply na
tional bank depositories and distribute
tho surplus by millions among the pet
bankB, and that is what they did.
Senator Edmunds says that ono of
the best features of the proposed na
tional election law is that it will placo
contested election cases in the hands of
the court, where they can be settled in
accordance with legal rules upon the
judicial examination of witnesses, as
such disputes are settled in England.
Any law that will do this will be a great
public benefit. The settlement of con
tested election cases by . Congress has
grown to be an abuse . and scandal, ex
pensive to the people and unsatisfactory
in results. It is a matter that calls for
reform.
As tho Chicago Tribune persists in
calling the McKinley law a prohibitory
act, its attention is. respectfully called
to tho following from the President's
message:
Already we begin to hear" from abroad
and from our enstom-honses that tho pro
hibitory ettect upon importations imputed
to the act is not justified. The imports at
the port of - New York , for the first three
weeks of November were nearly 8 pt cent,
greater thnn for the same period in 18$)
and 29 per cent, greater than in the same
period of 1888.
This is not a statement of opinion, bat
of fact.
Tlte Mabbett Infanticide.
Somo of the t circumstances connected
with the Mabbett infanticide make it an
Unusually pitiful case The three persons
involved seem to have been animated
solely by tho purpose of keeping the
mother of tho child from public shame aud
from tho condemnation of her friends, and
in displaying this motive they show a
recognition of and respect for social laws
that ought to indicate a higher and more
enlightened regard for the sacredness of
human life. Unfortunately, however, the
sacredness of infant life is a thing often
disregarded by persons more intelli
gent and far higher in the social
scale, than the Mabbetts, and in
murdering their sister's infant, aged threo
weeks, they were only going a step further
than some, who Trill hold up thtir hands in
horror at the ded. The past history of the
tvt oMabbctts does not indicate that they
were of a vicious nature, and it is, at least,
probable that the thought of murder would
never have occurred to them in connection
with an older person. The young men,
however, are sufficiently intelligent to be
fully aware of the view taken by the law
of such crimes, aud no sympathy need b
wasted on them. With the grrl the casa is
somewhat different. She is not yet seven
teen years old. A young roan of that ago
is tret-ted as a child, a boy, and is
judged accordingly when ho commits
crime, even murder. It is not necessary to ro
outside of this city or back more than two
years to find illustration In proof of this.
Upon a woman with an illegitimate child,
whether she be sixteen or thirty, society
places the condemnation and responsibility
deserved by maturity. This Mabbett girl
is certainly not without blame, and there
is no room for display of false sentiment in
her behalf; bnt it may be well to riinem
ber. in considering her case, that she has
been brought to her present condition by
others first, tho man who betrayed her,
'and. later, the men who persuaded her to
destroy the evidences of her sin. She is at
least deserving of a compassionate thought
from the social reformers and benevolently
disposed.
A few- days ago the Journal referred to
the conference which had been held at Chi
cago, by a number of Christian and He
brew teachers, with a view to bringing
about a better understanding between
Christians and Jews! Instead of joining in
the unkind criticism which marked some
Protestant clergymen at Chicago, the West
ern Christian Advocate of the 3d says:.
It seems time tbat such conferences should be
held more frequently, and In prealer earnestness
than heretofore. It would ho a singular con
clusion that the Hebrew and Christian cannot
sit and deliberate together, and reach great and
honest conclusions. The. Jew can reason, can
reach rrcat inductions, and the Christian can be
patient with his processes. We write in utter ig
norance of the feelings that animated tbl con
ference; we only surmise and hope they were of
the most , friendly character, and that the "les
sons", of that conference will soon provoke other
conferences in all the preat cities of the land.
The Jew and tho Christian owe it to themselves
to come into closer and more thoughtful rela
tions. Tins is a mean, hard-hearted sort of a
world, snd there are people in it just narrow-minded
enough to have their petty sus
picions aboct that romantically mysterious
secret commission with which the Hon.
Buffalo Bill went rushing wildly into the
West with much flourish of trumpets.,
They recall these facts: That General
Miles never said anything abont such a
commission, and he is the only man who
should hajje "given it up; that people with
secret missions do not usually tell about
them; that Buffalo Bill never got very far
from civilization on his mission, and lastly,
that Colonel Cody is in the circus profes
sion and advertising comes very handy in
his business. In fact, they offer pretty
strong circumstantial evidence that the
Hon. Buffalo Bill has played a daring hoax
on the newspapers, and is ahead several
hundred columns of "pore reading mattor."
The New York Sun says the influx of
Syrians is so great that 'some Syrian capl-v
talists of thaS city are talking of establish
ing a Syrian city in the United States. Tho

mascus has been chosen for the new settle
ment. If this movement makes as' slow
progress as the New Jerusalem movement
in New York it will bo a long time culmi
