This controversy between Stuy

That peace protocol which has been

offended the laws he should be let
alone. - And again If he has violated
the laws there Is no room for a com

has been ruffled again. Aldrlch and

Insulted to think that some of the
executive departments should really
draft bills expressing their ideas and
end them to congress to be acted .on.
These insults will probably be ap
peased by the senate killing all such
measures rerardless of their merits.
A sign that the millennium Is hur
rying on its way to Montgomery coun

were raided in Cofteyville a couple of
days ago. Tou may rest assured that
the city officials were not responsible
for the raid. No. indeed.- It mt th.
county officials who got busy. Now
there is talk of ousting the city
officials from their positions for thi-
connivance in the violation of the pro-

the annual pilgrimages to Shiloh
Hannah vowed that if Jehovah would
give her a son she would dedicate the
child to his service.
Every mother dreams dreams for
her boy sometimes dreams so lofty
that she dare not articulate them to
herself, much less to anybody else.
But underlying every other ambition
of a noble mother is the desire that
her son may be a good man. With the
deep Instinct of a maternal heart, she
perceives that all other successes are
vain, apart from a true character. It
used to be the common prayer of the
women of Christendom that their boys
might enter the gospel ministry; per
haps that this has gone out of fash
ion is one reason why there is such a
death of candidates for the sacred
calling. Hannah is hot being emulated
as she brought her Infant son up to
the tabernacle to offer him in service
to Jehovah. Every year thereafter
the mother carried to the boy a little
robe. Into which was wrought such
love and solicitude as only mothers
can know..
This Is a story of a boy who lived
his life in and about a church. Per
haps that may militate against the
present day attractiveness of it; yet
Samuel was by no means a "goody-
goody" boy, a milksop or a mollycod
dle. That type Is rightly sneered at to
day. This sentiment, however, may be-
come too sweeping.
Samuel's greatness can be traced di
rectly back to his boyhood environ
ment. The imagination loves to dwell upon
the picture of this little Hebrew lad,
busy about the small tasks Of the great
central place of worship. He was ' a.
prop and comfort to old EH, the High'
Priest, whose own sons had failed him.
What were Samuel's broodings upon the
glory and mystery of that Presence
which had been Israel's guide and pro
tector throughout its romantic history?
"A boy's will is the wind's will.
And the thoughts of youth are long, long,
thoughts."
The purposes which most profoundly af-
lect character and destiny are -those
formed in early youth.
One night Samuel heard a voice call
ing him. He thought it was Eli's voice.
It is natural to put the lower inter
pretation upon the higher influences of
life. A nersnn sftldnm iliprnR thn rpal
meaning of the greatest event3 in his j
heart history. What happens to a boy
often works out into mighty events in
the world's history. One day when
Moody and Sankey were In England,
Sankey put his hand upon the head
of a little Gypsy boy and expressed
the wish that one day he might preach
the gosnel. That boy became "Gypsy
Smith," England's - greatest evangelist.
His preaching turned to . evangelism
Dr. W. J. Dawson, a well known lit
erary man among the clergy. Dr. Daw
son's sermon on prayer converted Prof.
E. E.- Hale, Jr.; whose addresses among
educated young men have been-a fea
ture o" contemporaneous American life
as have also the sermons of Dr. Daw-
son and Gypsy Smith. No man can tell
where the streams will run that have
their springs lit the heart of a boy. .
In modern ' slang, Samuel would be
called a boy "on the job." He was a
little "minute man." No sluggard or
lie-a-bed was he; at the first summons
he was ready with a "Here am I," as
he hurried ' to Ell's side. Then was
imparted to Samuel, by the Lord's
voice, the news of the impending doom
of Eli's hoyse. It was a bitter, message
for the lad to have to hear arid carry.
His manner of receiving It was great.
After pondering Its meaning through
the night he went about the humdrum
duty of opening the doors and fulfilling
hts routine tasks. Happy is he who
knows how to hold fast to common
place, routine duty, even amid the
tragedies of life. When bidden to do
so. Samuel told brave old Ell every whit
that the Lord had spoken to him.
Out of such boyhood experiences
emerged Israel's A prophet,' Judge and
king-maker. Somewhere today are the
lads who will be tomorrow's great men.
They are "only boys" now; wise are
the,r elders who loolc uPn them in the
liKht ot what they wlu hecome. Every
boy ls an opportunity. Many a noble

STOESSEL. THE MARTYR.
. Can anything be more revolting to
the generous humanity of modern times
to the Justice that men deal out to
one another than the spectacle being
enacted in Russia today in the trial for
life of Lieutenant General Stoessel for
his "needless" surrender of Port Af
thur. The time has long since passed,
It ever existed, when officers of an
arroy should ever be compelled to stand
trial for life because; of being defeated
honestly In' battle. . That was the sort
of a defeat Stoessel suffered.
But disregarding sueh an argument,
Stoessel, of all the Russian generals
who participated in the Russo-Jap war,
Is the last who should be accused of
cowardice.. His six months' defense of
Port Arthur was gallant. " Although it
ended In failure this effort of hia was
one of the brilliant achievements on
the part of the Russians during the en
tire war. His surrender o the over
whelming army of Nogl was Inevitable.
And what a tragic- farce this trial of
Stoessel is. It Is not a trial such as is
known among righteous men. Think of
It. Stoessel Is arraigned before an un
friendly court to answer to a ridiculous
charge, a court consisting of ten Rus
sian officers who lost twice ten battles
through blunders and cowardice on the
field and graft at .home.
No -wonder Stoessel's men regard him
as doomed, a foredoomed martyr. For
a martyr he will be. HMfc trial means
nothing else than that his detractors
and persecutors are using him to cover
up their criminal practices in the hand.
ling of Russia's army. Stoessel has
been picked out as a sacrificial victim
to atone for the sins of the Russian
war office.
This sacrifice will be a heavy one for
Russian bureaucracy to make. Stoessel
is the one general of the whole Russian
army who is beloved by the down trod
den people. . Already their voices or
protest are beginning to rumble with
a noise that Is portentous. Stoessel s
murder by his inferior superiors will
surely be avenged. His foreordained
doom is fanning again the flames of a
revolution which was quenched with
blood. Once more will the streets of
Russia run red, this time in such tor
rents, perhaps, as will engulf for all
time it despotic government. If Stoes
sel's murder shall be the spark to kin
dle a fire which will make the people
of -Russia free, neither his life nor
death will have been In vain.

7 HE EVENIKG STORY j
Tne Outer Darkness.
IBy Sidney H. Cole.l
Ackroyd moved his chair from the

"ff aeaiea near the piano lamp, osten
sibly examining the score of a recent
musical farce he had brought her. Her
chin rested in nn u.ti j
and her eyes were fixed pensively on
"luoiu in ner lap. Ackroyd watched
her silently for some moments. He was
loath to disturb that pose.
"I saw Ted Briggs today." he said
1 icngtn, ana ne said it with the evi
dent expectation of a flutter of excite
ment on urusiiia's part. In this, how
ever, ne was disappointed. She turned
a page of the score without raising her
"Did you?" she said calmly.
I did," he affirmed. "Had a sort of
an aii-gone air about him."
Drusilla was silent.
"Looked as if he needed some one to
sympathize with him or kick him,'
Ackroyd pursued.
Another page of the score was turn
ed, Dut Drusilla. said nothing.
"Haven't seen him round here, late
ly, said Ackroyd, and his tone sug
gested much. ,
"It's something over a week since he
canea last," said Drusilla innocently,
Ackroyd smiled grimly, but Drusil
la's eyes being on the score, its mean
ing was lost on ner.
"Same old story, I presume," said
ne.
"What's the same old story?" she said
witn some emphasis.
"Got his conge, eh?" -.
"What are you talking about?"
"Ted Briggs." '
"Well, what about him?"
"He teems to have been cast into the
outer darkness with his Innumerable
predecessors," Ackroyd observed.
Drusilla shrugged her shoulders.
"I don't see why I should fret myself
over that." she said.
For casting him there, of course.
saia- Ackroyd severely.
Admitting I did." said Drusilla with
challenge in her voice.
"Ted Briggs is a particular friend of
mine," Ackroya began.
Must I marry all your particular
friends?" said Drusilla with sardonic
deference.
Ackroyd's eyes flashed angrily.
"You knew all the time he was tak
ings things seriously," he remon
strated. "5fou might have a little
mercy on such chaps."
Oh, don t let s squabble every night
you come here, said Drusilla wearily
'"Here's the Palm song. Shall I sing it
to you. Max?
She seated herself at the piano, ana
eang with all her inimitable little
drolleries. When she had finished she
swung about to face Ackroyd.
Did that soothe your savage breast.
Maxie? she asked, sweetly.
Ackroyd scowled. "When will you
ever be serious? he said.-
'I was never so serious in my life.
she asserted. "Indeed, I am com
pletely weighed down with responsi
bility and remorse. xou oon t lm.
agine he'll take prussic, acid, do you,
Max?" she enaea in tragic tones.
Ackroyd looked at her with cold
disapproval.
Between old mends . ne be

short.
"Now, Max, I'm awfully sorry, but
If you begin to scatter any of that
fatherly advice about here you'll have
to go home, and I counted on a de.
lightful evening with you here," rhe
said tentatively,
"Nevertheless," said Ackroyd, I
shall say what I set out to. be the
penalty what It may."
Drusilla rested her elbows on the
keys and looked at him archly.
I was about to remark." Ackroyd
went on, "that In the social sea you
are a sort of uncharted reef on which
the affections of many serious minded
young men are shipwrecked."
"What a metaphor!" she taunted.
Their shipwrecks don't seem to be
alarming calamities, however. They
survive them."
And there are others who are in
danger of sailing straight onto the
reef, knowing all Its dangers." he said.
Dear me! " said Drusilla. "They
should take a course in navigation."
The fear of ridicule may keep
them away for a time, but lit the end
they're bound to tempt fate," he said.
Drusilla regarded him amusedly.
"I think it would be interesting to
meet some of that class," said she.
"I can Introduce you to one," said
he. -.-!
When?" Drusilla inquired eagerly.
Now," said he, rising and bowing
gravely.
"You!" she gasped.
"Even I." he said unsmiling.
There was a somewhat embarrassed
pause. Ackroyd broke It.
"I shall never be happy until I offer
myself to you. I don't expect to be
happy afterward. I shall merely Join
the others in the outer darkness and
the suspense will be over.
Drusilla rested her chin on her palm
again. A bit of added color flushed
her cheeks; her eyes were pensive.
"I've been very much a coward,"
said Ackroyd. "I was afraid you'd
laugh. That is why I've been silent
so long."
1 He leaned forward in his chair: his
manner was pleadingly earnest. Dru
silla moved uneasily.
"Why don't you offer yourself, then,
and. have it over?" she asked.
Ackroyd squared his shoulders. "I
do offer myself, Drusilla." said he.
"My silence has been such a long one,
the laugh should be doubly merry," he
added bitterly. ,
Drusilla turned to the piano. She
ran her lingers over the keys In soft
little minor harmonies. Ackroyd wait
ed impatiently, then he strode to the
piano and bent over ner. something
ellstened on her lashes, and there was
a shining streak down either cheek.
"Good heavens!" cried Ackroyd in
sudden comprehension. He laughed
hanDilr.
"It it isn't funny. I I a
don't feel a bit like 1 laughing, con
fessed Drusilla.
And Ackroyd was thereupon reliev
ed from any fears or "the outer dark
ness." (Copyrigntea. ii7.)
