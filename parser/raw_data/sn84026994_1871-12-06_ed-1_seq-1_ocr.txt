COLUMBIA, 8. C., December 4.
If the temper and .intentions of both
Houses of the present Legislature can be pre?
dicated from the language of the host of bills
that are being.crowded upon them, lt sterns
very evident that a complicated and desper?
ate attack is to be made upon every one of
the State officiais whose position makes his
complicity in the stupendous frauds, recently
unearthed a matter of probability. Of the
fifty odd bills and resolutions presented to the
Legislature to-day, either by notice ot" intro?
duction or first reading, about one bah* were
aimed^ directly- at Governor Soother
Treasurer Parker, and a dozen moro
were offered in the House by enthusiastic
but i nj ucMcloutj mernoo rs, only to be withdrawn -
upon th.: -water's explaining that they would
be wholly inoperative and fattie by reason of |
technical blenders fallen into by their hasty
authors. It ls the misfortune, however, or j
such a Legislature as the State of South Caro
lina now possesses that no movement within
it cm exist for any length of time without as
suming a circular form-becoming "a Ring;"
and lt has come to pass that there now exists
in the Legislature an institution that can only
be correctly named by an apparent con trad ic- j
tlon of terms-a Beroi in Ring. The members
of this Ring are now throwing red-hot shot
into the gubernatorial camp, (moally, how?
ever, in the natara of threats BO far,) and the
outsiders are keeping np an Irregular, bush?
whacking fire upon the common enemy, va?
ried wilh spiteful side attacks upon the Ring.
Thus the dael bas become triangular, like
Midshipman Easy'a, but the quarrel is a very
pretty one as lt stands.
In the Senate this morning the ball was set
in motion by the appointment of Senators
Nash and F. yne upon Wilkes's joint commit?
tee, noticeo In Monday's NEWS, to Investigate
as to reducing, consolidating and abolishing
State offices. Another paper from tho House
waathe resolution to require the joint special
inv%rigHtlnz committee to report next Thurs
dayrand this provoked a lively and personal
debate, principally between Messrs. Whit te?
ni ore and Hayne, but participated In also by
McIntyre, Smalls, Maxwell and Swalls. Whit?
emore declared, very much as Dennis had
done In the House on Saturday, that two
weeks would be required for the actual print
lng, and that no*number of concurrent reso?
lutions could accomplish an impossibility, and
the Senate finally refused to concur and laid
the resolution on the table.
Amdtg the petitions which were next pre?
sented, lo accordance with tho usual order of
Sroc padings, was one from sundry citizens of
barleston, praying an act of Incorporation
for thc Citizens' Building and Loan Associa?
tion of Charleston, which waa referred to the
committee on Incorporations; and then came
the avalanche of billa and notices of billa.
Oi these the moat Important refer to financial
matters, among them being the following:
Mr. Swalls gare notice of his intention to
introduce "A blQ to make appropriation for
the payment of the per diem and mileage of
the members of tbe General Assembly, and
the salaries of the subordinate officers, and
other expenses incidental thereto." This bill
ls very similar, to Hayoe's bill for the same
purpose, already noticed in the House pro?
ceedings, providing for an appropriation of
$150,000 for current expenses and 1200.000 for
deficiencies, and authorizing the treasurer to
hold Incoming taxes subject to the demand of
members' pay certificates.
Mr. Owens Introduced, from the committee
on finance, "a bill to amend an act entitled Hui
act to authorize a Stale loan to pay interest on
the public debt,'" the amendment consisting
in striking out the fifth section; a bill to repeal
the act creating the sterling lunded debt whloh
in addition to repealing the bin directa the
Governor lo procure and deposit with the
secretary of State all the bonds piloted under
this act, and ua joint resolution Instructing 1
the State treasurer to refuse payment of|
drafts upon the treasury, except in certain
cases," ihe exceptions being tn favor of drafts
tMer specific appropriations of the Legisla
Mr. Whitemore introduced a joint resolu?
tion authorizing the attorney-general to se?
cure the possession of the sterling loan bonos
now said to be In the hands of the American
Bank-Note Company of New York, and place
them la the charge of the secretary of State.
This resolution, HS will be seen, ls intended to
cover the ground already covered by section
2 of Mr. Owen's bill, just mentioned. Mr.
Whitemore also Introduced a joint resolution
requiring the Slate treasurer, within Uve
days, to prepare a full exhibit of all stock?,
bonds and sec urti ?es of the State of South
Carolina, Issued during his administration,
and present the same to the Assembly, under
penalty of his removal from office, unless suffi?
cient cause for his default be shown before
the Assembly. Also, a Joint resolution requir?
ing the bonds and stock stated by the Gov?
ernor's message to be now in the State treas?
ury, not signed or issued, to be placed In the
bauds of the secraiary of State, and requiring
the secretary of State to cancel the same lu
the presence of a joint committee of the As?
sembly.
Mr. S wails Introduced a bill to repeal the
act pa-sed at the special session of the Legis?
lature authorizing the Governor to leave the
Slate under certain circumstances, which may
be taken as au Intimation that toe report, of
the joint special Investigating committee,
when received, will be such a crushing thun?
derbolt as to cause Governor Scott to long"for
the retirement ot his modest Ohio home.
Mr. Owens Introduced a joint resolution re?
quiring the finance committee of the Senate
' and the ways and means committee of the
House to walt upon the treasurer and ascer?
tain what moneys are now In the treasury,
and the amount paid out since October 31,
1871, and report immediately. This was at
onoe adopted, under a suspension of the roles,
and sent to the House for concurrence, but,
lu the House, lt was killed by the adoption of
tie following substitute offered by Mr. Bowen:
Whereas. It is currently reported that the
taxes which are now being collected and paid
Into the State treasury are being paid out by
the treasurer without authority of law:
Resolved by the House of Represen lat? ves.
the Senate concurring, That a committee of I
three on the part ot the House, and-on
the part of the Senate, ba immediately ap?
pointed to ascertain the amount of money
Said out by the State treasurer since' the 20th
ay of November last, and on. what account
said moneys have been paid, and that said
committee report by Thursday next, at 1 P. M.
Mr. Whittemore Introduced a r?solution,
which was also carr ed immediately uuder a
suspension of the rules, providing that no
person holding any Si ate or county office,
elective or appointive, shall be a clerk or sub?
ordinate -attach? of the Senate, and that no
clerk or other subordinate of the S-nute, or
?its committee.0, shall receive pay for more
than the time actually served.
This completed the introduction of bills, Ac,
and, the hour of one having arrived, the an?
nual message, which bad been made the spe?
cial order for that bour, was taken up. It was
summarily disposed of, however, by the adop?
tion of ? resolution, introduced by Whitte?
more, to refer its various subjects to appropri?
ate committees, but In the House it will
probably receive more extensive considera?
tion, as lt is there proposed to go into commit?
tee of the whole at one o'clock' to-morrow for
li s discussion.
The rest or the time of uie Senate was occu
Sed with the consideration of a few of ihe less
iportant general orders on the calendar, re?
sulting In their reference to various commit?
tees, and provoking nothing more interesting j
than an angry altercation between Messrs.
Leslie, Rose, Hayne, Nash, ?5wails and Mo-,
Intyre.
In the House of Represen! atlves, one of the
first things done was to direct, by resolution,
the removal of the magnificent central chan?
delier provided by Upholsterer Dennis, and
which ls ominously fal Hi: g to pieces, and
threatens ultimately to come down with a
crash and annihilate a few dozens of (he
sapient legislators whose seats are in that:
locality. Avery large number of -bills were
then introduced, of which those which are of
the most Importance, or which relate especial?
ly to Charlesron County, are named below:
Mr. Bowen gave notice of intention to in?
troduce a bill toll? crease and define the juris?
diction of the City Court ot Charleston. I
have been Informed that this bill provides for
the establish men t ot two separate courts for
the trial of civil and criminal cases respective?
ly, and for toe election of one additional
Judge.
Mr. Hedges introduced a bill to authorize
Megara. W. C. Garlty, F. W, Tlffifru Tl tn* B H I
Towles to establish and build a wharf at Mar-]
tin's Point, Wadmalaw Island, which was read
the fl st time and referred to the committee
on commerce.
Mr. Elliott introduced a bill to Incorporate
the Misbaw Zouaves, of Charleston, and a bill
to Incorporate a certain close monopoly, to be J
known as the Pawnbrokers' Company, which
were referred respectively to the committee
on military affairs and the committee on Incor?
porations.
Mr. Tocnm Introduced a bill relating to the
safe keeping of public moneys; a bill to im?
pose certain duties upon the c mptroiler gen?
eral and State treasurer, and a bili concerning
State and countv treasurers; all of which have
been previously described In this correspon?
dence, and ali of which were referred to the
wavs and mnan-i oommltt ?e. .
Mr. Lee Introduced the following concur?
rent resolution, which was laid over auder
the rules until to-morrow:
?I ?'lil mn, Toe comptroller-general bas offi?
cially Informed this House that ihe treasurer
of the State has neglected to make his month?
ly report for the month of October, 1871, as
required by law; therefore, be lt
fiesolved by the House of Representatives,,
the B?sate concurring, That the treasurer oi
tho State be,-and he ls hereby, requested to
inform the General Assembly, on or before
the 8th day of January, 1872, the reston why
'he has not made his report to the office of the
comptroller-general as required by law.
Mr. Adamson gave notice of a bill "to pre?
vent public officers from discounting or form
log a collusion with others la shaving pay cor-1
tiaoates, county orders or any claims wbar
ever on tbs State or county treasurers; and Mr.
White informed the House in the usual for?
mula that be bad In process ot gestation a bill
"fox the relief of widows and orphans of euch
persons as bave been killed by the ruthless
hands of an organization known as the Eu
FTJux."
There was besides the above a host of other
bills and resolutions, but they were either ol
purely local Interest or so crude and incohe?
rent In their provisions as to stand no chance
of passage even ia such a House ol Represen?
tatives, and In either case do not demand es?
pecial notice at this time.
Outside of the Legislature the principal
points of interest to the flaneurs of the capitol
appear to be the exertions of the hundred
and moro hungry looking fellows who have
swarmed to Colombia to gat Into clerkships
and the exertions of the members of Bowley's
pap committee to keep them ont thereof, the
log-rolling and pipe-laying preparatory to the
election of circuit judges and associate justice
of the Supreme court, which, by the way, Is
certain to be postponed Irom the 13th Instant,
and probably until after New Tear, and the
forthcoming report of the Joint special Inves?
tigating oommltt ee. Of this report great
things are predicted. It has been oom
Eleted, contains four hundred pages, and
i now, I believe, in the hands of the
printers. The members of the com?
mittee, Messrs. Dennis, Whittemore, Hur?
ley and Gardner are all here, and are hard
at ?work every night at Whlttemore's resi?
dence, and Bowen Ts a frequent guest among
them. They are extremely reticent as to the
contents of their report, and claim that when
lt appears the necessity for reticence on their
part Just now-will be made perfectly clear;
they disclaim responsibility for the pretended
and partial statements of what their report
con tai n s that have appeared, and deny the ac?
curacy of such statements, and they are keep?
ing a vigilant watch upon both the nurse and
person or Governor Scott. The rumor ls that
Governor Scott is preparing for flight It ls
probable, of coarse, that this is only a rumor,
but there are men here, and plenty of them,
who assert with great vehemence and appa?
rent candor, that Lieutenant-Governor Ran?
gier will very soon become a Governor by re?
version, and lt is really not Impossible that
South Carolina may have the uncomfortable
distinction of having the first colored Gover?
nor In the United Sute?._PICKST.

two hours in an elaborate reply to Hr. Staa

his motton to quash tbe Indictment. Altera
recess of fifteen minutes, District Attorney

MR. STANBERRY'S ARGUMENT.
A Masterly Effort.
[FHOK OUB OWN CORRESPONDENT.J
COLUMBIA, December 4.
In the United States Circuit Court tc-day the
greatconstitutional argumentas to the compe?
tency of that court to assume jurisdiction over
the alleged offences which are expected to prin?
cipally occupy its present session; the correct?
ness ot the indictment' under which the first
group of the a'leged offenders have been
brought into court, and the validity, lb the
light of the organic law of the land, of the
various dragooning! processes which have
culminated in these trials, was made by ex
Attorney-General Stanberry, who occupied
two hours in a carefully considered, logical,
subtle and powerful argument addressed to
the intelligence of the court, but
eagerly listened to by a tarong of in?
terested spectators, among whom lt is
safe to say was every lawyer now In
this city who could make it convenient to
attend. The court was held In the elaborately
furnished library room of the Statehouse
whtch was well filled, floor and galleries, with
a heterogeneous audience (which bleached as
the argument proceeded,) the space devoted
to the bar being crowded wtth lawyers and
Judges now visiting or residing In the city.
The preliminary business of the court con?
sisted of the call of jurors, the swearing in of
Alderman Alva Gage, of Charleston, as an
additional talesman, and the retiring of the
grand Jury to their room. The case of the
United States vs. Allen Crosby et al (the pris?
oners indicted last Friday for conspiracy and
burglary,) was then called, and the court sta?
ted that they were ready to hear any prelimi?
nary motion that might be made. Mr. Stan
berry arose and moved to quash the indict?
ment against Allen Crosby et al. In support
of his motion he sild :
ARGUMENT OF KOS. HEN RT ST AN'B SRRT.
X-JLy it please your Honors-Wa have flied a
motion in behalf of certain of the defendants,
tnat the indictment which was returned true*
bill to this court, on theist of December, shall
be quashed, and each and every count there?
of, fur reasons set forth in the bill. I tarn?
ished at the earliest practicable moment,to my
friend the district attorney a copy of our
motion, and the reasons upon which lt was
grounded, so that. hp. mfchf h^f?f ft" ??t?ji an.
opportunity as possible to make the prepara?
tions.
The indictment, if the court please, contains
not less than eleven counts. All of these
counts, except two, charge a conspiracy, and
those two counts-the eighth and ninth
charge the commission of an act without any
allegation of a prior conspiracy. All the of?
fences charged under these eleven counts re?
late to suffrage and an interference with its
exercise, except two-the eighth, which
charges an interference with rights secured
by the constitution to exemption from unrea?
sonable searches and seizures of person*, pa
Krs and effects; and the other charges the ot
ice to be an ?Oenee against the act of Con?
gress scouring to each citizen equal protec?
tion ander the law.
I think tbh Is about the scope of the vari?
ous counts. I shall proceed la detail, If the
court pleases, to state our reasons why this
indictment, and each and every count thereof,
canoot be sustained; and I may say in tho be?
ginning, If the court please, that my friend
and myself, associated in this defence, intend
to mifce no captious objections. We do cot
sit here merely to contena for delay and post?
ponement, or to contend over merely lonna)
mattera, Wh'ch, whether amended or not,
would make no particular difference to our de?
fence; but to contend for matters which we
deem essential to the defence, and which it ls
not oar privilege es counsel to waive in be?
half ot our clients.
To to on, then, with the first count, meet?
ing merely the formal parts of it. It charges
these defendant, together with divers other
evll-dloposed persons, ai at York County,
in the State of South Carolina, on the first day
of February, 1371, unlawfully did conspire to?
gether wltn intent to violate the first section
of the act entitled "An act to enforce the
rights ot citizens of the United States to vote
In the several States of this Union and for
other purposes," approved May 31sr, 1870, by
unlawfully hindering, preventing and re?
straining divers male citizens ot the United
States, of A i ri ca ti descent, above the age ot
twenty-one years, qualified ta vote at any
election by the people, from exercising the
right and privilege of voting, and by other un?
lawful means not allowing them to vote at an
election by the people, to oe held on the third
Wednesday of Ociober, 1872, within the
county, district and State aforesaid, contrary
to the act of Congress, In such case made uni
provided, against the peace and dignity of the
United Slates.
First of all, this count refers to a particular
section of a particular law, as that embraced
within this conspiracy, and which lt was by
this conspiracy to violate, which U to violate
that first section of the enforcement act of
1870. Ii the court please, it is that first sec?
tion; we must find the corpus delecti there; the
thing prohibited there; lt ls an Infraction of
that section we are now called upon to answer.
Let mc read lt: "An act to enforce the right of
cMzens of the United States to vote m the
several States of this Union, and for other
purposes, passed"-directly Bet forth in the in?
dictment-"passed and approved May 31,
1870." This, then, ls the section which we are
charged with violating: "Be it enacted bvthe
Senate and House of Representatives of the
Uulted Slates o America, in Congress assem?
bled. That all citizens of the United States,
who are or shall be otherwise qualified by law
to vote at any election by the people, in any
State, territory, district, county, city, parish,
township, school-district, municipality, or
other territorial snbdivl-Lon, shall be entitled
and allowed to vote at all such elections with?
out distinction of race, color or previous con?
dition of servitude, any constitution, law, cus?
tom, usage, or regulation ot any State or
territory, or by or under its authority to the
contrary notwithstanding."
Your honors are perhaps listening to find
where is the penalty lor violating that section !
Where ls the prohibition In that section?
What does that section do ? Simply declares a
right, not a punishment for its violation. It
would seem, if the court please, that that is
not enough where gentlemen undertake to
locate a particular section, of a particular law
whloh we are called apon for an alleged In?
fraction of, they must be very careful to Bteer
very straight. It was unnecessary to do this,
bat, having done it, and referred us to it as
tb? section which we are charged with viola
'?og, they must be careful to bring the offence
strictly within it. The first objection, then, to
this count is that the section to which tbey
refer, and which they claim we conspired to
violate, declares no penaltv; lt merely confers
a right, but does not guard' lt with any penal?
ty, or make lt a crime to violate it; but we
have other objections which apply not ooiy to
this section, but to others subs?quent t
And the first, objection is that the na
of the persons whose suffrage was lc
. fered wi eli, or intended to be in ten",
with, by this coosplrrcy are not set ?
nor is lt alleged that the grand jury d d
know their names, and were Ignorant of tb
there is no excuse given. This, perhap
one of Ihe most material things in this inc
ment. It ls not done lor being conspirai
against all the world; lt 1s lor conspirln
violate the rights of certain Individuals. W
individuals ? that ls the first question. V
are we Informed are the persons whose rig
we have Invaded ? Not a name given,
any excuse for no: giving ? name, is lt i
albie that lt ls necessary to argue that pol
Would it be good to say we conspired to m
der a man without glvlBg his name or with
saying the name ol the person was unkno
to the jury? If the grand jury do not kc
the names of the persona, and, from necesa
could not name them, they would be excus
from that nece--lry, but for no other reas
It is not necessaty to refer to element
books to sustain that point.
What next ? The specific electlotrat wh
they were not allowed to vote Is not stat
nor does it appear whether lt was an elect
for representatives to the Congress of
United States or foran elector of President
vice-President ot the United States, or lo
State officer, Governor or any officer elect
under the Constitution of the State.. We i
not told what was the character of this el
tlon, or when lt was held, or what It wa* f
we are entirely abroad as td that. No not
of what election was to be held, or for whi
they were to be prevented irom voling. Nc
if the court please, the charge Is that tr,
conspired to violate that first section by i
lawfully hindering, preventing and restra
iug divers male citizens of the United Stat
ot African descent, above the age of twen
one years, qualified to votent any election
the people ia said county, district and Sta
from exercising the right and privilege of v
lng, and by other unlawful means hot allowl:
them, tho said male citizens, to vote at aa eh
tlon by the people, to be field on the thl
Wednesday of October. A. D. 1872. Now,
the court please, we al-o object to this dal
1872. What does the gentleman mean by
date like that ? Of course a Bate stated la i
indictment generally is nof. material, bat
may become very material. Suppose you sta
as a day upon which a orlmels committed t:
3lac day ol June. There ia no such day tn ti
calendar; lt ls, therefore, aa impossible dat
and ihe indictment ls bad. Suppose you.su
ia your Indictment a day which Is after the 1
dlctment is found; that Is-a material ave
ment, and that makes the indictment bad. (
suppose, as here, a future day which bas nevi
yet happened; as a matter of course, th
would make the Indictment bad. I really BU
pese the gentlemen made a mistake. Did yt
mean 1872, gentlemen ?
Mr. Corbin (the District Attorney.) Exactl
Mr. Stanberry. Ifyoudidnot mean lt ?
will allow you to amend lt. As to the omi
sion of che names, and the omission of static
the mean? resorted to, any further than thl
that by unlawful means, threats and Intlmid
tlon, without tuting their character cr ar
thing of the kind, and without stating whi
election, whether for State, count y or munlc
pal purposes, In all these particulars, tl
question arises whether lt ls necessary, In s
indictment tor conspiracy-?or such an offene
as this-to set them oat definitely.
Now, if the court please, lp Ihe first plao
what is the nature' of the offence ? A wasp
racy against what? Against the exercise i
the right to vote, that ls the offence. Tc
character of the offence ? It ls not against an
right which a man ls in the exercise of all th
time, as the right to enjoy bis liberty, and t
the protection of bis person or property. 1
ls nut a right to vote all the time, but a rig!
to vote at aa election; the right caa never b
exercised exceptio voting ?t aa election.:' I
therefore, cannot be Infringed or impairer,
except by preventing the exercise of that rigr
at an election.
It ls not charged here (and If it were, !
would be ridiculous to say.) that these d<
fendants combined to deprive hun of th
right to vote generally; that they cannot dr
It is Impossible, lor even the parties canoe
divest themselves of that right by not votin,
for years. The rirrht remains to vote whei
they choose, at thc ?roper election, and the
'c?li only divest tnemselvesorthat right by rt
morai, ?c. But the right to take away hi
vote, to rob him of his vote, does not resld
In any combination; mat can only be doue ii
the mode pointed oat by law-as, for la
stance, upon conviction of an Infamous of
fence-so that the infraction of this right, ii
point of law, oannot be a deprivation .qf tin
right so as to take from the party his right
Itis not property or chattel that can be setzet
and converted to another's use or seized am
transported to another place put ot th<
reach of the owner. It ls a personal right
Intangible, that resides within himself, anc
which cannot be taken away, except In th<
legal mode. Therefore, a conspiracy to deprlv*
a man ot the right to voie, as a right, ls f
thing Impossible, and the court would be at i
disadvantage to sit and hear a cause whlct
Involved such a wrong principle of law as thal
a party being an African, and entitled to vote,
his right to vote was divested by conspiracy.
Tala power lo vote ls another thins; but I am
now ppeakiog of the right, lt ls a right,
then, li the court pisase, that can oniytje In?
terfered with in its exercise; lc cannot, as 1
nave said, be taken away; bat lt may be Inter?
rupted in Its exercise, interfered with in lu
exercise, or he may be prevented from exer?
cising it. Wno ? when ? under what circum?
stances ? The only time at which he can ex?
ercise tho right ot suffrage Is at some election
at which he ls qualified to vote. Now, that
being BO, what must an Indictment state ? Tnat
this conspiracy to prevent a man from voting
would Interfere with the free exercise of his
right to vote. Why as a matter ol course lt
must charge that lt had reference to an elec?
tion; to an intended exercise of that right
to vote; to an opportunity to give that
vote. Therefore, the election must be
stated, and lt must appear to be such
au one as ls contemplated by law; that is,
an elect lon for public officers, cot an election
for baok directors or anything of that kind,
but an election for political officers. It fur?
ther must appear what sort of an election lt
ls, whether for representatives In Congress,
and, therefore, a Federal election, or whether
lt ls an election for some officer of the Sute-a
Sute election. But we know nothiog of this
by Ibis Indict meat. All omitted. Em i rely at
large, what election they mean, or what o trices
were to be elected; whether lt waa to be a
special or general elecHoo, we are left entirely
ia the dark by the allegations lu this count.
And this failure, if the court please, to noti?
fy us of what election it ls, gives rise to anoth?
er very serious question. It they had alleged
I nat it was an election for Stale officers, we
Hiiould have another thing to say, and that is
ihis, that a law ot Congress which attempts to
regulate the election of State officers ls void
ana unconstitutional; that any Interference
with the domestic concerns of a Sute the con?
stitution throughout forbids. Whereas, If it
was steted to be aa electlou for Federal
officers, that objection would not He.
Again, lt the court please, it is nowhere al?
leged that he was qualified at this election,
whatever it was, any further than ls stated
that he was-what ? "that they were male
citizens of the United SUtes above the age of
twenty-one years." Those two things are
qualifications. -'Qualified to vote at an elec?
tion by the people of said county." Qualified
to vote how ? Qua lided to vote where ? Qual?
ified to vote, It Baye, "At any election by the
people of said county, district and State, from
exercising the right and privilege to vote."
Qualified to vote, ls that enough ? Is the
stating ot that legal concludion enough ? How
do we know that the grand jury understood
what was necessary to qualify a roan ? What
ls their presentment ? They say these parties
were qualified to vote, and they go
on to state two qualifications, but they are
not enough. They go on by saying that
they were male persons. That is all very well.
Females are not allowed to vote by Federal or
by your Sute law. Then they further proceed
to say that they were citizens of the United
Statee. That is all very well; that is another
qualification, but not all. Then they proceed,
further, to sute lhat they were of the age of
twentv-one years and upwards; still anoih.-r
! special qualification. Now, the grand Jury arc
on the road to sute the qualification, and to
show the court, not by a legal conclusion, but
by facte, that they were qualified to vote; but
they Blop short. Every qualification Is nec?
essary; they give us three-the sex of the
party, the age of the party, the citizenship of
the party. But what next? They fail to show
us the residence-a material and necessary
thing to go Into the qualifications to vote at
any election.
The allegation ls that we conspired to vio?
late that first section, which fixes no penalty
and declares no crime for- Ita violation,
doubtediy, the other' sections of that st
do, but be bas chosen to place bis cause
the first section and npon that alone,
conspiracy ls to violate that section-not
fifth section, nor the sixth section, nor
seventh section, but that particular sectio
Now, the next count. If the court pleat
that these parties, together with divers
disposed persons, conspired together, wit
tent to injure, oppress, threaten and in
date Amzl Ralney. Here the gentle
seems to bare understood that lt ls necee
to name the party injured, and, in thal
spect. this count Is not liable to that objei
-that the parties Injured ore not nai
Amzl Rainey is described as a citizen o
United 8tates; that 1B all very well; that ls
qualification; and his right and prlvllej
stated to be the right of suffrage securt
him by the Constitution of the United Sb
Now, pray, does the United States secure
party the right to vote In any State ? Doei
United States fix the qualifications for su
voter ? Wherein has the Constitution ol
United States or Congress attempted to ve
citizens of States the right to vote and to Ha
qualifications ?'.The gentleman. perhaps
be able to show me. None of my rescan
have enabled me to find any such author!)
the constitution or In any act of Congress.
Now, the third count, and this ls a very
portant one. This, of course, brings up n
distinctly the grave objections which I
arose in this c-iee-those which no grand
cao amend. .These charges ere as falle
That those defendants, Ac, Ac, on sue
day at York, Aa., "unlawfully did conspire

to hinder his tree exercise and ecjoymert
right and privilege granted and securer
bim by the Constitution and laws of the U
ed States, to wit, the right of suffrage, c
trary, Ac," and the Jurors, Ac. "do turi
present that said Allen Crosby, Ac, in the
of committing the offence aforesaid, Ac

burglariously did break and enter, with int
to commit a felony, and that the said

and upon the head, shoulders and back ot
said Amzl Ralney, then and there unlawfu
maliciously and feloniously did strike,
and wound, with Intent to do unto
said Amzl Ralney some serious bodily hat
contrary to the form ot the statute in st
cases made and provided, and against i
peaceand dignity''-of what ? Of the State
South Carolina ? This last, if the court plea
is a material averment in all indictments,
the gentlemen wish lt I can certainly prodt
authority, but when I speak in this way to t
court, and state questions of law, I do i
state them unless lam certain that I am st
ported by the authorities. In England as w
as in this country this conclusion to an
dlctment is material and can never be on
?ed. In England, lt is the older forms, if ye
Honors recollect, contra passim, I. e.. it
against the peace and dignity ot the Unit
States, when lt Is an offence against the U
ted St a'es. and of the State ef Booth Carol ii
when lt ls an offence against the State
Sooth Carolina, and to omit lt In any Indi
ment vitiates that indictment.
This third count, as I have said ia the fl
place, goes onto allege that the conspira
was to oppress, threaten and Intimidate An
Bilney, a citizen of the United States, w
Intent to prevent and hinder his free exerc
and enjoyment of a right and privilege grai
ed and secured to bim by the constitution a
laws of the United State? as In the seco
count, and all my objections made to thc
otber counts for want of certainty, Ao., apf
equally well to this. What I now want lo c
the attention ot tbe court to ls an addendi
which br ogs U9 under this, j uris Halon of t
State laws. In the first place, your hone
will find that the burglarious entry, cbarg
here. Into the dwelling house of Amzl Rain
ls not alleged as aa overt act of the conspli
cy. Not at all. Nt r as an act within the BOO
of the conspiracy. Not at all. It ls allegi
altogether as an independent act; simply tm
whilst In the act or violating the rights
Ralney with respect to the suffrage, they e
tered bis house burglariously in the night tin
with Intent to commit a felony.
AS a matter of coarse, to punish a man f
committing a burglary or a murder or an a
sault and battery under this section, his (
fence must be overt-the indictment mn
show lt and mutt have a proper concluslo
It must appear what felony, crime or ml sd
meanor has bt en committed. It won't do
say that, In the act of committing the prevloi
felony or crime, he committed generally
felony, crime or misdemeanor. It might be
muruer. and the man would have no notice i
whom he murdered. It happened to be bu
glary here, and the gentleman has very pro
erly drawn a very good Indictment. I take i
exception to lt. He had a form for that, ac
he has followed the form very accurately. Thi
ls, In fact, the only good offence set forth I
this whole count.
Now, as I said, what authority have yoi
honors to try these men ? Not burglary of it:
postoffice ? Not a burglary committed in
Jnace where the United Slates has exclusif
urtscllcilon. Net burglary ora postofflce c
of a public building of any sort ? Not at al
Not a burglary, connected in any sense wit
any function of the Government of the Unite
States or that lt is allowed to protect ' Will
be contended that your honors have any J url:
diction to try or punish aman for any sue
offence? for you must try him first and fin
him guilty first, before you can apply the put
lshment.
This ls one, of those great questions tbs
arise and deserve the most mature consider?
tlon. Yonr honors may hesitate-may, pei
haps, prefer to refer this question to the St
preme Court of the United States. Undoubi
edly it will go there. It may happen that 1
the course of any administration ot this- lan
the point, perhaps, not being made, or th
defendant being without counsel, the cour
may run Into the difficulty, Into the gr?a
error, of trying a man for a domestic murde
In a court of the United States and hang him
I therefore object to this count, first, be
cause lt concludes against the peace and dig
nlty of South Carolina. Besides this objection
if the court please, and the further objectloi
that I have stated that the charge ls partial
laxly against the State, not against the Unite?
States, and that this o jurt bas no Jurladlctioi
to try that offence.
Now, the fourth count, if the court please
is one that does not charge any conspiracy
but charges a direct act-that at York, on thi
1st day of February, 1871, "unlawfully did at
tempt," not conspire, but "did attempt tc
control Amzl Ralney In exercising the right o
suffrage, to whom the right of suffrage I:
guaranteed by the fifteenth amendment to tin
onstltntlon ot the United States.
The qualifications of voters Congress leave;
to the domestic policy of the State. In som*
of the States most men of color have been al?
lowed to vote, sometimes, with the property
qualification. Congress did not Interfere wi tl:
that, any more than to say, you shall not dis?
criminate, If you have a property qualification
for black men, in your constitution, to vote
lt shall be there no longer, all must:be equal.
Then, I repeat, may it please your honors,
wherever they found, then, the right to vote
upon the fifteenth amendment, they have
-looked in the wrong place; for ll Amzl Rainey
can vote, simply because of toe right secured
to him by the fifteenth amendment, according
to the construction given by the gentleman,
he can vole, whether he ls twenty-one er not
whether he has resided in York County or not,
or whether he ls an Inhabitant of this State or
not.
The fifth count : It also does not charge a
conspiracy. It charges, tiret, an interference
with his exercise of the right of suffrage, just
as the fourth count does, and then superadds
the charge of burglary.
The sixth count is very much like this, ex.
cept in this : That the allegation ls, "unlaw?
fully did conspire together, with intent to in?
jure, oppress, threaten and intimidate Amzl
Raine v, a citizen of the United States, because
of his free exercise of aright and privilege
granted and secured to bim by the Constitu?
tion and laws of the United States, to wit : the
right of suffrage." When ? how prevented ?
Retore an election, or alter an el ec; ion ? be?
fore he voted, or alter he voted ? All left un?
certain ! It is impossible to tell whether they
Intended to injure him prior tb or after thc
exercise ol this right.
The next is the seventh. That is precisely
like the one I just read and subject to the
same objections. And then again comes this
burglary and felony and other matters super
added, "agalost the peace and dignity of
South Carolina."
The eighth count is a new one: "That these
defendants did conspire together," with In
Lient toJolure, oppress, threaten and intimi?
date Amzi Raluey, a citizen of the United
.late?, with intent to prevent and hinder his
free exercise and enjoyment of a right and
privilege granted and secured to him uv the
Constitution of the United States, to wit,' "the
right LO be secure in his person, houses, pa
1 pera and effects against unreasonable search
es and seizures, contrary to the act of Con
ns in such cases made and provided." That
e whole count.
There is no act of Congress to secure a man
against searches and seizure?. It ls declared
to be a right in the constitution; so is the
tight of personal liberty, and a thousand other
rights that are sacred rights secured to me by
the Constitution of the United States. But I
cannot go to a Federal tribunal to vindicate
them. On the contrary, there are very few
causes that I can go to a Federal tribunal to
vindicate.
We live in the Slates: we are prof cted by
the States. What surrounds me. when I am
at home or here, but State law ? That is over
me, above me, and around me. Great God I
have we forgotten altogether that we are citi?
zens of States, and 'that we have States, tv pro?
tect us ? I am a Union man, in every sense of
the word. I have stood by ' lt always, and
shall stand up lorever tor the Union. I am
against certain rights called "States rights,"
but such rights as these, any one that invades
such rights will find me, from first to last,
with bis antagonist. While I would not give
to the States rights that' have bi en surren?
dered to the United States, I. will fight,
to the Slast ditch, against Federal usurpa?
tion, either through the legislative, exec?
utive or Judicial authority. These ure not
political privileges; they are personal,
sacred Immunities, that attach to us as indi?
vidual0, and are protected by the domestic
law. I hope to God never to live In a country
lu which the laws ot the country, within Its
proper Jurisdiction, does not protect me In the
exercise of my rights and privileges.
At the conclusion of Mr. Stanberry's argu?
ment, the prosecution not being prepared to
reply, an adjournment was allowed until ten
o'clock to morrow, when lt is understood that
the duty of replying in this case will devolve
upon Dl8lr!ct Attorney Corbin, with such as?
sistance In the meantime as may probably be
afforded by his colleague, Attorney-General
Chamberlain. PICKET.

Resolutions of the Clergy Present at the
Fanerai of Ute Rt. Rev. Thomas Fred?
erick Davis, D. D., Senior Bishop of
the Diocese of Sooth Carolina.
CAMDEN. December 4.
Almighty God, in His most wise providence,
has removed our earthly head from us. Oar
beloved senior bishop ls no more; suddenly
have we been called upon to part with him;
He, who with all a father's love and a shep-,
herd's watchfulness has gone in and out before
us for eighteen years, loving and beloved, bas
laid down hi* staff of office and returned to
the Master to give, we are humbly assured,
with Joy, an account of his stewardship. We,
his survivors, desiring to express our pro?
found gratitude to God for having raised up
and strengthened his servant for the wort
which he has accomplished In this our church
sod diocese, do offer the following resolutions:
Resolved, That la the death of the Bight
Rev. Thomas Frederick Davis, D. D., our late
senior bishop, the church hoe sustained a
severe affliction; that the clergy have lost an
eminent example of Christian wisdom, sim?
plicity, piety and consecration to the service
of Christ; aa officer of rare merit and effi?
ciency, zealand earnestness, and whose suc?
cess, under suftrlnjn. indrmltles and blind?
ness, tn ad vant . ./ ue glory of God and the I
real interests or his church, are everywhere i
felt and acknowledged.
Resolved, That we cherish his memory a? \
stimulus to exertion la the cause for which he
lived and In which he died; and that we ac?
knowledge bis blight example with gratitude |
to God for its vouchsafe ment to us, during BO
long a period, and with continual remem?
brance of the obligation which lt Imposes upon
us to be imitators of him aod of all those who
through faith aod patience have Inherited the
promises.
Resolved, That wo recognize the hand of
QOd la so arranging the affairs of the diocese
as not to leave a.?, Ta our bereavement, with?
out a successor, whose assistance was cordial?
ly accepted by our late diocesan, and to whose
administration we now look forward with hope
and confidence.
Resolved. That a copy of these resolutions
be seat to his bereaved family, with the assar-1
ance of our heartfelt sympathy, aod oar pray?
ers on their behalf to the God ot the fatherless
and the widow-the God of all comfort and
of all consolation.
Resolved, That those resolutions bs publish
I ed la the Camdon and Charleston papers, and
la thc Monthly Reeord.
WHAT CONGRESS IS DOING.
WASHINGTON, December 5.
Blair's resolution of Inquiry, covering a de?
tailed report of exeoutlve action under the
Ku -Klux bill, was defeated la the Senate by a
strict party vote except Tipton.
In the House a sharp discussion took place
between Fernando Wood and Dawes regarding
the continuance of thc committee on the In?
surrectionary States, which Wood maintained
was a trick to continue the reconstruction
committee.
The administration sustains Its first defeat |
of the season on tbc subject of the postal tele?
graph. Dawes moved to refer to a select com?
mittee so much of the President's message as
recommended the absorption of the telegraph
system In the postal service ot the country.
This was opposed by Randall, Farnsworth,
Nlblack, Beck and Banks, who contended that
the subject should not be taken from a stand?
ing committee and referred io a select one,
which would, necessarily, under the parlia?
mentary nile, have a majority In favor of the
project. After an animated discussion, In
which thc scheme was denounced as one
that would bleed the treasury to the amount
of seventy millions, and add twenty thousand
employees to the civil service of the govern?
ment, the motion for a select committee was
defeated, and the whole subject mei red to
the committee on appropriations, which ls
considered tantamount to a rejection of the
project, ._ _
