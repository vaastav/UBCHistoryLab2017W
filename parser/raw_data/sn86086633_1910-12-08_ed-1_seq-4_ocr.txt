President Taft's message reminds
one of the messages which T. Roose
velt was wont to send to congress It
id so different. A diligent perunal f:i ll
to reveal any mention of the "square
ileal," or "predatory wculth."

The two traveling men, who were
charged with illegal voting at the re
cent special election in Ked Jacket,
and discharged from custody yester
day because the election was not legal
in the eyes of the law, may consider
themselves lucky. They did not know
at tW time they voted that the elec
tion was Irregular, and took long
chances when they swore in their
votes. They may have done It fr a
"lark," but whatever their motive I'
Isn't likely they ever will do so again.
They have learned a lesson.
How many millions of dollars are
spent each year on toy over the en
tire, world will never be accurately
known. An Idea of the magnitude of
the commerce in this line can be had
from the fact that the United States
imports yearly over three million dol
lars worth from Germany ulone. This
is only a very small iart of the to
tal product. The United States m ikes
comparatively few of the household
tos itself. Of the more expensive line
such as novelties and scientific toys
the lnite5 Stites factories produce
great quantities, but In the manu
facture of cheap dolls and the like
France and Germany lead the world.
Prom Hungary come most of the an
imals and figures in rubber an. I the
papier mache dolls. Japan has of re
cent j ears' Increased her output in
toys and Is today uppl.vln,r e very
country on the globe with the Japan
ese dolls are made of paper, bamboo,
Ivory and enamel.
Nuremberg and Paris lead the world
in the roluction of dolls.
Toyland has seen a great transition
In the last few years. The scientific
toys and toys of pport have to a con
siderable extent replaced the simpler
to of a generation ago. Airships,
wireless, moving pictures. torpedo
bouts ate today staples in the toy
ii all:, t rather than novelties.
The announcement by Govertior
Fleot n.sborn that he will not be u
undulate for a second term empha
sizes his sincerity of purpose and the
fact that politics will play no" part In
his appointments or recommendations
to the legislature. This is as the people
would have it, although hii. h a state
of ulTairs Is not likely to please poli
ticians who play the game simply for
what they can get out of It.
Mr. Osborn's annomeement strength
ens our faith in him, if that were pos
sible. W'e have elways believed th it
as governor he would conduct the r.f
falrs of the state from an unselfish
standpoint and for the best
undoubtedly foivtdirtdow a recom
mendation to the legislature that It
consider the submission of an amend
ment UVth posiitutlon changing the
term of governorship from two years
to one term of four ears and If the
legislature favorably considers his
suggest ion b In "one-tirmP anno uncement
will give .Assurance that, he as a two
year gocrtior vlli not succeed to a
four ear term. Mr. o-'orn believes
a four-yen r term now desirable as It
would enal)k the governor to be more
Independent Inasmuch as he would not
have to consider nnd cater to popular
ity and popular mew.ircs to insure a
Ft coml term. Neither would he have
to make an excess of political appoint
ments, i
As n result of the Jlalllnger investi
gation three reports vvete estcrday
submitted to Congress by the con
gressional committee. The majority
interests import, pre pa red bv seven Republican
of the people, atul now we are more
than sure of it. He is satisfied, he
t-a.vs, to return to the duties of a pri
vate citizen at the expiration of his
executive term, and to take up again a
personal work to w hich he plans to de.
vote the rest of his life. Hut It Is n
iiuestlon whether he will be allowed to
remain a private citizen, as he looms
up largely in the public eye and It is
doubtful whether the peCple will per
mit him to retire permanently as he
wishes. They may insist on his filling
some higher office In the public ser
vice, and this demand may be such
that he cannot refuse. However, It is
apparent that Mr. Osborn has no such
expectation at the present time, for he
says, "My one ambition is to serve
the state faithfully for one term and
then return to the pursuits of a private
citizen."
His Intention to serve only one term
members of the committee, exonorates
the secretary of the interior and finds
him "honest and faithful In the per
formance of the duties of his high of
tiie"; the minority leport. sent in by
the four Democratic members, declares
Secretary Pallinger has not been true
to the trust rejtosed in him and re
commends his removal; and the third
report, an Indepedent statement made
by Hep. Madison, Republican, is ad
verse to the cabinet official, being sim
ilar In tone to that of the minority
report.
As far as the Republican represen
tatives as a whole are concerned the
majority report undoubtedly is accept
able, but the Democrats, who are op
posed to Kallinger, likely will endeavor
to put the House on record as to Its
opinion of this report. If no action is
taken at this session of Congress ll
means that none ever will be taken,
as the report will lose Its force with
the expiration of the present Congress
In March.
Just as there are varying opinions
among members of Congress concern
ing the llalllnger ease so are there dif
ferent opinions among citizens
throughout the country, and there will
be contention, nnd embarrassment for
the administration, as long as 1UII
Inger remains in office. There has
been no disposition on the part of Mr.
Taft to remo.e his secretary of the
Interior, ami there Is no good reason
why he should chunge his mind now
Inasmuch as the majority report of the
congressional committee must be gen
erally uccepted by the country nt large
as the ruling verdict.

It Is generally conceded In the ath
letic world, nnd at Ann Arbor, that
the University of Michigan bus come
to a place where It must decide what
Is to be the course of its athletic poli
cy for many years to come, nays the
Mining Journal. The conference hav
ing plainly shown that Michigan will
either have to come Into the organiza
tion, or else give up any idea of hav
ing athletic relations with the leading
western universities, what Michigan
has to decide is whether it is going- to
find Its athletic future in the east or in
the west. A new athletic board Is
about to be chosen, and this question
will be taken up ut some eurly date.
Professor Holbrook, chairman of ihe
present board favors Michigan's re
turn to the conference, saving: "I
think that our place is In the west and
of course I would like to see Mich
igan back in the conference. It isn't a
question now of the justice or injus
tice of any rules: it is u question
purely and simply whether or not
Michigan prefers eastern g:mes and
her present position to membership in
with confidence. Put Michigan now
must make up Its mind what it wants
to do. It will be much easier for it
to get Into the coiiforece this ear than
at some later date and the course It
t!e Ides to embark on will probably be
held to for several years to come, for
belter or for worse.
Agriculture Is rapidly becoming an
organized business. It Is dividing
along natural lines Into separate field
f operation. Until recent years, the
farmer endeavored to produce all his
living from his farm. He raised a
sufficient tyiantity of wheat, corn, po.
tatoes, meat, fruit, etc., to satisfy the
needs tf his family. There was prac
tically no market for the surplus. At
present, however, there is a cash mar
ket for whatever products the farmer
has to sell. This has made It possible
for him to grow those products for
which his land is naturally udapteet,
and for which his training and tastes
have specially prepareel him to pro
duce. This modern trend in practical agri
culture calls for a much greater de
gree of . skill than the dd method. If
a man places all his eggs in one basket,
lie must be very certain that the bas
ket eloes not fall on the way to mar
ket. If a man centers all his inter
ests ,in one lino of agriculture, he
should be an expert in that line'. If
he Is not, any failure will be disas-
