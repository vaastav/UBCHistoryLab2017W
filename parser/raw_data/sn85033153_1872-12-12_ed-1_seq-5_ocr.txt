HEADQUARTERS OF THE NATIONAL DEMOCRATIC (
Committee, New York, December 3. t
The Democratic National Convention did in Ju
ly, 1872, with an unanimity unprecedented in the
history of the party, nominate as their candidate
for the office of President of the United States,
Horace Greeley, of New York. Six States cast
their electo. - *' votes for him at the late election,
and millions of men In other States where we failed
of success testified their appreciation of his noble
character, and the great service he had rendered
the country, by voting onr ticket. But
Horace Greeley is dead, and the splendor of the
political victory achieved by his opponents is now
diminished h; the sorrow which this sad event has
cast upon the people whom he loved, and who re
gained him as one of the best, truest and bravest
of men.
The lessons of his pure and blameless life will
long remain Impressed upon the age in which he
lived. Every beat of his great heart was in sym
pathy with humanity in its broadest form. He
loved tne Government, ho loved his fellow men,
and the labors of his whole life were to elevate the
condition of mankind. No struggle for liberty, civil
or religions, was over made on the surface of the
earth, since his manhood began, with which he did
not affectionately sympathize, or to which he failed
♦o give faithful and powerful aid. Every day of his
life abounded with acta of kindness, of charity, of
forgiveness, and of love. Not his stricken family
alone.bnt a stricken people, sorrow for a loss wholly
inscrutable and almost unparalleled. The Nation
al Democratic Committee, In behalf of the
great party who achieved honor by their faithful
efforts to elect him to the firs*, office in the Govern
ment, will do all in their power to honor his name
and memory. Augustus Schell,
Chairman National Democratic Committee.

Friend Lantnan;
Received yours of the 25th instant I have all
tfly life been doing what people called vastly fool
ish and impolitic acts, and I do not dispute their
Judgement. I only said that what I did seemed to

or be beaten therein, please testify forme that I do
not regret having braved public opinion when I
the ,ht it. wrong and knew it to be merciless,
(Signed,! Horace Grkelet.

Horace Greeley—His Illness and Last
Hours.
New York, November 29.
The Tribune furnishes the following ac
count of the illness and last hours of Mr.
Greeley;
So far as any of his associates perceived,
Mr. Greeley was in almost as good health
as usual when, on the day after election,
he wrote the card announcing his resump
tion of the editorial charge of the Tribune.
His sleeplessness was known to have be
come greatly worse, but for years he had
suffered more or less from the same diffi
culty, and as is now clear sufficient allow
ance had not been made for the intense
strain upon him throughout the summer,
especially during the last month of his
wife’s illness. But it soon became evident
that his strength was unequal to the hard
task to which he set himself. He wrote only
three or four careful articles, no one of
them half a column in length. The most
notable, herhaps, was that entitled
“Conclusions,” wherein he summed up
his views of the canvass. In all he wrote
less than three and a half columns after
his return, contributing to only four is
sues of the paper. Two or three times he
handed his assistant short articles, saying,
‘ ‘ There is an idea worth using, but I
haven’t felt able to work it out properly.
You had better put it in shape.”
At last, on Tuesday, the 12th inst., he
abandoned the effort to visit the office,
and sent for the family physician of Mr.
A. J. Johnson, the friend with whom he
was a guest, and in whose home his wife
had died. Every effort was made to in
duce sleep, but he grew steadily worse,
until it became evident that his case was
critical. Dr. George C. Choate and oth
ers were called in consultation, and final
ly it was decided to take him to Dr.
Choate’s residence, two or three miles
distant from Greeley’s own country house
at Chappaqua Here he received the un
remitting attention of Dr. Choate. Here
Dr. Sequord, Dr. Brown and others were
called in consultation.
The insomnia had developed into in
flammation of the brain, and under this
the venerated patient rapidly sank. At
times he was delirious, at other times as
clear-headed as ever. He lost flesh and
strength with startling rapidity, and in a
few days the possibility of his speedy
death forced itself into unwilling re
cognition. It was not, however, until
Thursday that his associates and family
brought themselyes to admit it, and even
then they still clung to his faith in the \
vigor of his constitution.
On Wednesday night he failed very
rapidly. Thursday afternoon and even
ing he seemed somewhat easier. During
the night he slept very uneasily, mutter
ing occasionally, and frequently raising !
his right hand.* Toward morning he was
more unquiet, and between eight and
nine o’clock fell into a nearly unconscious
condition, which continued with some
intervals through the day. He made oc
casional exclamations, but many of them,
in consequence of his extreme weakness
and apparent inability to finish what he
had begun, were unintelligible. About
noon, however, he said quite distinctly
and with some force— “I know that my
Redeemer liveth.”
During the day he recognized various
people, his daughter many times, the
members of his household at Chappaqua,
Mr. John R. Stuart and Mr. Reid, On
the whole he suffered little, seemed to
have no more than the ordinary restless
ness that accompanies the last stage of
disease, and during the day his extremi
ties were cold and there was no pulse at
the wrist. The action of the heart was
very intermittent and constantly dimin
ishing in force. He had not asked for
water or been willing to drink since his
stay at Dr. Choate’s, but during Friday he
asked for it frequently, and up to within
ha'.f an hour of the end h manifest
ed in various ways his conscious
ness of what was going on
around him, and even answered,
in monosyllables, and intelligently, ques
tions addressed to him. About 3:30
o’clock he said, very distinctly, “It is
done,” and beyond the briefest answers
to questions, this was last utterance. His
youngest daughter, Miss Gabrielle, was
with him through Thursday evening.
Throughout Friday the elder daughter.
Miss Ida, was in constant attendance, as
she had been during the whole of his ill
ness and of Mrs. Greeley’s before him.
Other members of his Chappaqua house
hold were present, with Mr. and Mrs.
John R. Stuart and a few other friends.
Nothing that science or aflection could
suggest wag wanting to ease the last
hours. The wintry night had fairly set
in when the inevitable hour came.
Without, sleighs were running to and
fro, bearing to Chappaqua, the nearest
telegraph station, the latest bulletins,
which the thousands of anxious hearts in
the great city near by kept demanding.
Within, the daughter and a few others
stood near the dying man, who remained
conscious, and seemingly rational and
free from pain, though now too weak to
speak. In an adjoining room sat one or
two more friends and the physician. At
6:50 o’clock they drew back in reverent
stillness from the bedside. The great
editor was gone in peace, after so many
struggles, and after so much obloquy.”
THE “TRIBUNE’S” EDITORIAL COMMENTS.
The Tribune for to-morrow says;
“The melancholy announcement of the
death of the editor and founder of the
Tribune, though for a few days it has
been expected by his family and intimate
friends, falls upon us with all the shock of
sudden calamity. Ho had reached, in
deed, a high old age, but time had not
laid its withering on him. His
splendid constitution easily bore ths strain
of enormous labor. His mind was as
fresh and' strong, and suggestive as in the
prime of life. His generous impulses
were unchilled by disheartening experi
ence. Through the trying campaign
which has just closed, his physical vigor,
his tact, his intellectual activity, sur
prised even those who knew him best,
and seemed to promise many years of use
fulness. It is certain that no history
the most critical period in our national
life cam even be written in which Horace
Greeley shall not be a conspicuous figure:
but the noblest career in his eyes was that
whieh is given up to others’ wants. The
successful life was that which is worn out
in conflict with wrong and woe. The
only ambition worth following was the
ambition to elevate human misery, and
leave the world a little better than he
found it. That he had done this was the
consolation that brightened his last days
and assured him he had not lived in vain.
“It is not for us, in the first hour of our
loss, to paint his character or catalogue
his virtues. Although for several months
we have missed the inspiration of his
presence and guidance of his wise coun
sel, his spirit has never ceased to animate
those chosen to continue his work, and
the close bond of sympathy between the
chief and his assistants has never been
broken. We leave his praises to the poor
whom he succored, to the lowly whom he
lifted up, to the slave whose back he
saved from the lash, to the oppressed
whose wrongs he made his own.”
THE “HERALD’S” OBITUARY.
The New York Herald, in its editorial
to-morrow, speaking of Horace Greeley,
says :
“From day to day, for a week past,
news of Mr. Greeley’s severe mental and
physical prostration have left this com
munity and the country not wholly un
prepared for his dissolution, and yet we
may say of him as the expiring Chief,
Red Jacket, said himself, that the news
of his death will come upon the people
like the sound of the fall of a great pine
in the stillness of the wood. He has, in a
mistaken aspiration for higher usefulness
and power and glory, fallen a sacrifice to
his political ambition. He had failed to
appreciate the commanding position
which he had secured as the leading
American journalist, and leaving it to
pursue that of the Presidency, he derived
sustenance from a shadow. Greeley’s
industrious and useful career is full of
encouragement to young men who, with

THE ‘ ‘TIMES’ ” EDITORIAL.
The Times for to-morrow, in an editori
al on Greeley’s death, says;
“Mr. Greeley’s loss to journalism is one
which cannot be replaced. The incidents
of his last sickness were peculiarly dis
tressing, and, from all that we can learn,
his reverses during the late campaign
cannot alone account for them. Had he
been successful the probabilities are that
he would not have lived, so overtaxed
was his strength and so utterly broken
down seems to have been his constitution.
The labors and excitement of the canvass
were more than his body or mind could
bear.
“We shall not attempt, at this moment,
to do justice to Mr. Greeley. Asa jour
nalist and public man, his life is a part
of the history of the country during the
last thirty years, and the time has not yet
come when it can be impartially consid
ered. It is certain that Greeley’s name
will always be honored in connection
with the anti-slavery struggle, and with
many important measures which he
fought for with remarkable vigor, simply
because he believed they were right. Into
these subjects we will not now eliter, for
the eountry is scarcely rid of the din and
turmoil of a memorable and unhappy
past. Historians will do justice to Gree
ley, and in the meanwhile his country
men will be strangely forgetful if they '
fail to pay due tribute to his memory. He
has been before them for about a genera
tion, and he has had their confidence in
many trying periods of our history. Let
us now remember only his virtues and his
genius.”
Report of the Commissioner of Inter
nal Revenue.
The report of the Commissioner of Internal
Revenue states that the aggregate receipts from
all sources, exclusive of the duty on the capital,
circulation, and deposits of National Banks, were,
for the following fiscal years ending June 30 ;
1870 ..,$185,2.35.8157
1871 144,011,176
1872 131,770,946
These amounts include sums refunded and al
lowed on drawbacks. The decree® in the aggre
gate receipts for the last two veats is due to the
legislation approved July 14,1870, which reduced
the revenue to the estimated amount of $55,000,C0)
per annum, but which did not go iito fnll opera
tion before the close of the fiscal year 1871. The
receipts from spirits show an increase over the
last year of $3,992,046. The sources are given as
follows: Spirits distilled from apples, peaches,
or grapes, $544,848; spirits distilled from materials
other than apples, peaches or grapes, $42,572,940:
distilleries' per diem tax, $2,010,986; distillers’
special or barrel tax, $6,489,786; wine made in
imitation of champagne, $2O; recti £crs, $955,704;
dealers in retail liquors, $4,025,604; dealers,
wholesale liquor. $2,065,563: manufacturers of
stills. $1,391; stills or worms manufactured, 426;
stamps, distillery warehouse, $290,264; stamps,
rectifiers’. $367,920; stamps, wholesale liquor
dealers’, $139,602; excess of gangers’ fees, $4,118;
tote!, $49,475,576.
The number of grain distilleries registered the
last year was 511; fruit distilleries, 33Sq making a
grand total of 3,649. The return* to this office fof
the last fiscal year show a total production In taxa
ble gallons from materials other than fruit, of 68,-
275,745; from fruit, 757,788; total yearly produc
tion, 89,081,533.
The Commissioner recommends that Section 51
of the act of July 20, 1868, as amended by the act of
June 6, 1872, be further amended so as to author
ize, in a more explicit manner than at present pro
vided, the requiring of export bonds of persons
applying to export distilled spirits for the benefit
of drawbacks.
The tax received n fermented liquors, at $1 per
barrel, during the first quarter of the fiscal year
ending June 36,1872, was $2,217,191, while the re
ceipts from the same source during the first three
months of the present fiscal year amount to $2,-
e 84,541, an increase of $466,949. The average in
crease of about a million dollars annually during
the last three fiscal years, as contrasted with the
stationary character of the receipts during
four years next preceding. Is certain
ly gratifying, but the increase during
the first three months of the present fiscal year, as
above stated, far exceeds that of any corresponding
period in any other year since the organization of
this office. The tax received on fermented liquors
at $1 per barrel was for the years.
1867 $5,819,345
1868 5,685,663
1869 5,866,403
1870 6,081,520
1871 7,115,974
1872 8,009,969
The number of persons engaged in the manufac
ture of fermented liquors during the fiscal year
ending June 30, 1872, was 3,421.
“I would recommend that sections 18 and 22 be
so amended as to provide for packages known as
thirds. The act of March 3. 1872, authorized their
use to accommodate brewers west of the Rocky
Mountains, who are compelled to send their pro
ducts from the breweries to the consumer or retail
er on the backs of mules, this said package being
specially adapted to such mode of conveyance.
Thirds appear to have been omitted in the act of
June 6, 1872, through inadvertence, and they
should be restored.”
The Commissioner is of opinion that the amend
ments made by the act of June 6, 1872, to Section
50 of July 30, 1868, as amended April 10, 1869, re
latin'; to the special taxes for selling spirituous and
malt liquors and wines were intended simply to
provide that, in addition to the former classes of
liquor dealers there should be two classes, at
a lower special tax, authorized to sell malt liquors
only, leaving to the former classes of liquor deal
ers the privilege of selling malt liquors, which
they previously possessed; also leaving unchanged
the exemption from special tax as wholesale deal
ers, extended to brewers, who sold fermented
liquors of their own production, at the brewery,
in the original packages. As that intention is not
so clearly expressed by the language of the sec
tion as amended as is desirable in so important a
provision of law, the Commissioner recommends
that the language of the section be made
more explicit. He also recommends that retail
dealers in malt liquors be limited in their sales to
quantities less than five gallons, and that those
selling in quantities of five gallons and upwards
be required to pay the wholesale dealer’s tax.
The total receipts from tobacco for the fiscal
year ending June 30, 1872, were $3C736,170, show
ing an increase over the previous year of $157,263.
The Commissioner says that, so far as he is able
to judge, the law providing for a uniform rate of
tax on all manufactured tobacco, whether chew
ing or smoking. Is operating very satisfactorily.
The Commissioner says he has reason to believe
that, with the safeguards provided by
the new law against the sale of manufactured t*
bacco in fraud of the revenue, and with the taxes
imposed upon the sale at retail of raw or leaf to
bacco, for consumption without its being subject
ed to any process of manufacture, collections from
tobacco, under the uniform rate of twenty cents a
pound (which is a reduction of more than six cents
a pound from the u-erage rate for the last two fis
cal years) will reach nearly. If not quite, the sums
realized for either of the same years.
The Commissioner has seen nothing so far
which leads him to distrust the practicability and
the complete success of the provisions made by
the act of Jane 6, 1872, for facilitating the expor
tation of tobacco to foreign countries.
“Under the present law the credit system Is en
tirely dispensed with, and no special privileges are
given for making a monopoly of trade in manu
factured tobacco. All tobacco is required to have
proper stamps affixed, Indicating the payment of
the tax, before it Is removed from the place where
it is made, except that which is Intended for and
actually bonded for export to a foreign country be
fore leaving the manufactory. This system, it is
believed, will greatly widen the field tor exporta
tion, since it provides for direct shipments from
any district in the country, the manufacturer flil-
Ing his bonds and completing his shipping
papers in his own district. It provides, also,
for the payment of the tax on said tobacco
by any person who desires to export, giving him
an allowance of drawback for the tax paid, a
privilege which was not allowed under the previ
ous law. Persons having in their possession tax
paid tobacco, however badly damaged and unsala
ble, even to such a degree as to render it worthless
for sale or consumption, can, by exporting the
same, always realize therefrom an amount equal to
the tax.
“The act of June, 1872, required the reduction
of the internal revenue districts In the United
States to not exceeding eighty in number, by unit
ing two or more districts into one, and also the re
duction of the minor officers in the service to as
small a number as would be consistent with their
limited dnties. To avoid a "inch greater loss by
the untimely disturbance that could possibly be
compensated by the consequent reduced expendi
ture, temporary delay was universally advised and
finally determined upon. The interim was used in
pushing to a rapid close the collection of the bal
ances. The result has justified the propriety of
the delay.
“The act of June 6 reduced the duties of Asses
sors and Assistant Assessors so as to have hut
three things which could not he done with equal
propriety by the Collectors and their Deputies, the
two classes of officers remaining both numerous
and expensive, for a work that one class could as
well do. The three duties referred to are the as-
the deficiency taxes on distillers, an
unexceptional tax, only occasionally due, and the
data for assessing which is always at hand from
daily reports in this office. Second, the special or
license taxes, which are collected, as a genera]
rule,hut once (in May) each year. The third,and only
remaining duty with w hich the Collectors might
not be entirely entrusted, is the tax on banks and
bankers. This tax is payable but tw'ice during
each year, and is the sole remaining tax on corpo
rations.
“ Inasmuch as the plan of reduction under the
act of June 6, only provides absolutely for the
reduction of some two-thirds of the principal
officers, 160 in all, and left the reduction
of the assistants, over 1,300, discretionary.
It seemed to be the better plan to ask
Congress to make the larger reduction and make
that
of coromissron a thousand or more of officers.
Experience has demonstrated that nothing short of
unequivocal, Inexorable law, can surely do It.
Discretion admits of doubt and suggests delay, in
view of the great confusion and loss of revenue
anticipated by a general disturbance of the collect
ing officers. The simplicity and security of a sys
tem which shall have hut one class of officers, and
these all under bonds; the fact that nothing is
left for the assessing class to do that cannot he
dohe either by the Collectors or this office, and
that a saving of 'rom $1,000,000 to $2,000,000 per
annum of expense in salaries, etc , greater than
would be effected under the act of June last, can
safely be anticipated. I have had prepared thtb
outlines of a law which will give effect to the
above ides. This will he presented to the proper
committees of the House of Representatives and
the Senate Immediately upon their assemblage in
December proximo. If it is the judgment of Con
gress that this plan is preferable to that contem
plated by the act of June, I ask their early adoption
of its provisions, that it may be put in operation
completely by the 30th of June, 187-3.”

The New York Weekly Tribune Agri
culturally Couiidered.
The Weekly Tribune, now more than thirty
years old, has kept up with the progress of
the age in improvement and in enterprise. It
devotes a large share of its columns to Ag
riculture, as the most essential and general
of human pursuits. It employs tbe ablest
and most successful cultivators to set forth
in brief, clear essays, their practical views
of the Farmer’s work. It reports public
discussions which elucidate that work; gath
ers from every source agricultural news, the
reports of the latest experiments, the stories
of the latest successes and failures, and
whatever may tend at once to better Agri
culture, and to commend it as the first and
most important of progressive Arts', based
on natural science.
There are hundreds of thousands engaged
in diverse pursuits who own or rent a
“place,” and give some portion of their time
to its culture and improvement. The Weekly
Tribune shows them how to make the most
of their roods and their hours, both by direc
tion and example. No information equal in
quality or quantity can be elsewhere obtain
ed for the price of this journal.
The Weekly Tribune appeals also to Teach
ers, Students, and persons of Inquiring
minds, by the character of its Literary con
tents, which include reviews of all the works
proceeding from the master minas of the
Old or of the New World, with liberal ex
tracts from those of especial interest. Im
aginative Literature also claims attention,
but in a subordinate degree. ‘‘Home Inter
ests” are discussed weekly by a lady spe
cially qualified to instruct and interest her
own sex, and the younger portion of the
other. No coinmn is mere eagerly sought or
perused with greater average profit than
hers. The News of the Day, elucidated by
brief comments, is so condensed that no
reader can deem it diffuse, while given suf
ficiently in detail to satisfy the wants of the
average reader. Selections are regularly
made from the extensive Correspondence
of The Daily Tribune from every country,
audits editorials of more permanent value
are here reproduced. In short. The Weekly
Tribune commends itself to Millions by
ministering to their Intellectual wants more
fully than they are met by any other journal,
while its regular reports of the Cattle,
Country Produce, and other Markets, will
of themselves save the farmer who regularly
notes them far more than his journal’s
price.

Our Imprudence the Cause of Cons ump

©f our last sickness to either a crowded
room, and then coming out in a cold air, or
wearing damp clothes, causing a cough
which settles upon the lungs, producing
seated pains in the chest. Allen’s Lung
Balsam will check the disease, and restore
health to the system, if only used in
time.
Remember and call at the drug store for

Millions of pairs of shoes tipped with
metal are sold every year. For children’s
shoes they are absolutely indispensable, un
less one can afford the waste of buying two
pairs, when only one would be needed ; and
few can safely submit to such a constant

omies of the household that supply its mem
bers with comfort, and at the same time
make the load of the father of moderate
paeans a lighter one to bear. Cents invested

A Fixed Fact in Pharmacy. —Consid
ering the multitude of diseases, it is
amazing that we live: In view of the
countless remedies for them, it is wonder
ful that we die. Unfortunately, how
ever, all the diseases are realities; whereas
most of the “remedies” are humbugs. One
exception to the latter rule demands the
recognition and approval of the press.
We refer to Dr. Joseph Walker’s Vine
gar Bitters. Of the Doctor himself, we
know nothing; but of his medicine we
an speak from observation, for it seems
to have found its way into almost every
household. Probably it is more exten
sively used in this country, as a family
remedy, than any other preparation al
though it has not yet been before the
world three years. Wherever we go we
hear of it, and whenever we hear of it, the
comments on its efficacy are enthusiastic.
We have questioned sufferers from liver
complaint, lemittent fever, fever and
ague, chronic headache, vertigo, irregu
larities of the bowels, indigestion, rheu
matism, neuralgia, gout, kidney diseases,
and affections of the lungs, as to its effects,
and the uniform answer has been, “7< is
doing me good." Believing that “what
everybody says must be true,” we have
no hesitation in admitting that Vinegar
Bitters is the Great Medical Success of
the present century.
Cable Screw Wire Boots and Shoes.—A
word of explanation may sot be out of place.
The cable wire acts as a screw, is strong and
firm, and at the same time is elastic and
comfortable. It is mnch preferable to the
old method of pegging, and quite as soft
and elastic as sewed work, but much strong
er and less liable to rip, and much less ex
pensive. W r e have tried the cable screw
shoe, which has proved all that is claimed
for it. The increase in this new method of
manufacturing boots and shoes is very rapid,
and promises to supersede tne wood peg and
waxed thread.— The Standard, Chicago.

Why Endure What Is Curable f
“What can’t be cured must be endured," says the
prevprb: but Indigestion can be cured, and therefore
It Is the merest stupidity to endure It. Dyspeptics
have certainly a right to continue dyspeptics to the
end of their days if they choose, but as it Is not sup.
posed that any rational being prefers physical tor
ment to ease and health, the probability Is that if all
sufferers from Indigestion were convinced that an ab
solute, infallible remedy for their complaint existed,
they would with one accord resort to It. We moat
emphatically declare that such a remedy docs exist,
and that Its name is Hostetler's Stomach Bitters. The
record of Its success extends over a period of more
than twenty years, aad it Is fearlessly alleged that
during the whole of that time rt has never failed to
afford permanent relief in any disorder or derange
ment of the stomach that was not organic, malignant,
and Incurable. The testimonials that go to establish
this important fact can he counted by the thousand.
Stomach complaints that had been aggravated by a
total disregard of alldictary rules, and intensified and
rendered chronic by medicinal treatment or drastic
purgation, have in hundreds of instances been cured
within three months by the systematic use of this cel
ebrated stomachic and alterative. It should bo re
membered that weakness of the digestive organs In
volves many other aliments. Biliousness, headache,
nervous debility, spasms, palpitation of the heart,
rush of blood to the head, nausea, vertigo, and sleep
lessness are among ita concomitants and results ; and
for all these the great vegetable tonic is a specific.
It acts first upon the stomach, and through the stom
ach npon the secretory and nervous systems and the
bowels, its general effect being always genial and be
neficent.
A Glorious Record.—Twelve years ago a few
modest lines In aNew York journal invited public
attention lo anew Vegetable Restorative, and so

Introduced to the world. It was a success from the
beginning. AH that was claimed for It as a tonic, a
corrective and antidote to malarious fever, was found
to be strictly true. Within live years the annual sales
of this article amounted to over One Million of Mot

to.flve million*. The annual consumption of ine bit
