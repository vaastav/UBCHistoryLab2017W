bt s original poem, writte W
sur 7%e e D Bn, .33 now&
By Joan Keandrat WaNa. 0
Hi thre, my friend! Just pause &while.
-Bit down and for a moment smile.
Why try to carry all the wrack
Of this whole world upon your back?
Therere others right beside you here
With shoulders broad and Purpose clear
Who're ready to take up their share
Of our great Universe of care.
And what they cannot carry leave
To other shoulders to retrieve
And-hist!-those Souls have furthest
trod
Whove left 80M part of It to God.
Today's message may offer the last
opportunity President Wilson will
have to address "Gentlemen of the
Congress."
Mrs. Wilson must share her honors
as first lady of the land with others
who have gone before, but Miss Jean
nette Rankin is alone as the first lady
of Congress.
"Uncle Joe" Cannon is not yet
Speaker, but the rapidity with which
the moving pi'cture men ground at
at the Capital when he appeared yes
terday makes it certain he figures
large among the reel people.
Those handshakes were so numer
mus on the flsor of the House and
Senate yesterday that it was hard for
the Impartial observer to tell whether
they were congratulations on victo
ries or defeats.
Now comes the New York Medical
Journal with a suggestion to boost
the cost of being ill. If put into
effect, we pause to wonder if a boy
cott would succeed in lowering
prices.
Representative Cy Sulloway, of
New Hampshire, may have been call
ed many things by the, Democrats of
his State, but he hardly will resent
those political slaps as much as the
remark of a certain woman in the
gallery, who inquired of her escort,
"Is that Carranza?"
Those who were disappointed at
the failure of Congresswoman-elect
Miss Jeanette Rankin, of Montana,
to exercise her right and take a seat
on the floor of Congress as a mem
het-elect were not confined to the
feminine sex, even though the fair
ones predominated in the galleries.
There were many men among those
who scanned the faces of members
for the first woman to appear on the
floor of Congress.
The fact that 5w men of the
Thirtyeecond Michigan Infantry re
volted and demanded that they be
sent home from the border Indicates
a very serios atuation. Col. Louis
1 Coei Invited the ringleaders to
met him man to man in physical
emal=et and thm checked thq revolt.
It does not cnceal evidence, how
ever, that some of the Guardsmen are
esmm rritahbe and Impatient at
the long-dehed Mecam. settlement,
a"d that the men would welcome
AiAha aseranes that their stay on
So border will be prolonged or end

After a recess of lens than hred
sponths. the snal essIon of 'the W
ty-fourth Congress was eeavened
yesterday and the task otesasUalg
a veritabe f.t'stal of 10ghastoaw
was begus.
The most interestinj feature of the
fAet day of the session was the sub
mission to Congress by Secretary o
the Treasury McAdoo of the esti
mates of the money that will be need
ed for the conduct of Federal and
District governinents for the fiscal
year ending June 3o, 19A
For the Federal government the
great amount of $,654,8g,654 was
asked. This sum is $annoanao in
excess of the estimates for the pres
ent year. For the District govern
ment $i6,96xo92 was asked. This sum
is $4,oooooo in excess of the estimates
for the current year. ' It is evident
that the high cost of living has be
come an important factor in the
household of Uncle Sam.
Study of the estimates reveals that
a large percentage of the increases in
the estimates are due to recommenda
tions to Congress for higher salaries.
The Commissioners of the District
are prominent among those for whom
increases are asked. The Commis
sioners now are paid $5,ooo a year and
they ask for an increase in salary ot
$2,5oo each, which, if granted, will
raise their compensation to the level
of that received by members of the
Senate and House.
There is no doubt that it is diffi
cult for a man occupying the positiom
of Commissioner to meet the demands
on his pocketbook on a salary ol
$s,ooo, but the man who receives that
amount has not been as hard hit by
the increasing living cost as the man
wBo receives less. Congress prob
ably will take this fact into considera
tion and is likely to give moje atten
tion to the recommendations for in
creases for the small-salaried employe
than to recommendations for in
creases for those whose salaries are
sufficient to garantee them againsl
actual privation.
The failure of the Commissioners
to recommend a horizontal increase
in salary for all government employes
is certain to cause much disappoint
ment, especially among those whose
salaries in connection with a much
higher living cost have been reduced
to wan). The Commissioners have
recommended more pay for a large
number of District employes, but
have ignored many who are in the
greatest need and whose compensa
tion is most inadequate fog the ser
vices they render.
The same policy has been followed
by the executives in the different
branches of the Federal government.
Instead of advocating a horizontal
increase they have recommended ad
vances in pay only in individual cases,
If all of the increases in salary that
have been asked are granted Con
gress will do much for the relief ol
the government workers, but the only
way by which full justice can be done
is to provide for a horizontal increase
in salades for all government em
ployes.
Higher Pay Advocates.
The Washington Herald today
publishes In its news columns a list
of 264 members of the House of Rep
resentatives who are on record as
favoring an increase in pay for gov
ernment employes to meet the new
demands raised by the higher cost
of living. Of the 264 Representa
tives listed, 204 are on record as fav
oring the enactment of Representa
tive Nolan's bill providing for the
establishment of a minimum wage ol
$3 a day for all government em
ployes. The remaining sixty favos
salary increases, but in most cases
they advocate methods different from
that proposed by Mr. Nolan.
This list was procured by Mr. No
lan In a poll of the House during the
first session of the present Congress
when the minimsum wage bill was
pending. It is true that Mr. Noar
made the record prior to election
but it Is hardly likely the fact thai
the campaign has ended will cause
any of those listed to reverse them
selves. On the contrary, the promi
nence given to the increasing cost of
living since the election probably ha.
won more advocates in the House
for higher government salaries.
Perusal of the list of Representa
tives who have told Mr. Nolan they
favor higher salaries probably will
convingqe many skeptics that the
higher cost of living has furnished as
argument which Congress cannot ig
nore and that there is an excellent
chance for legislation for the relief o1
-the government workers during tii~e
present short session..
The Colonel is quite sight when he In
sIsts that his friend "the average man"
would not "remnaIn morally obtuse It he

The co-operation of State
ties has been asked for ibis work'
Special efort will be msade to secure
men for the Saval reserve foree, pro
vision for which was made by Con
gress when it passed the naval ap
propriation bill last August: The pur
pose of the reserve is to have a large
number of qualified men ready in
time of war or national emergency.
Each member of the reserve receives
annual retainer pay in addition to ac
tive duty pay.
To be eligible for the reserve a
man must be a citizen of the United
States and obligate himself to serve
in the navy throughout a war or dur
ing the existence of a national emer
gency, should either arise during his
term of service.
There are six classes in the new
reserve force, which provides for the
organizations of volunteer patrol
squadrons and for the civilians who
went on the training cruise. In ad
dition to the reserve force the navy
will need 40,0oo men for active serv
ice in 1017.
We have now in the yards three
super-Dreadnoughts that are al
most ready for launching and work
has just started on two more. Other
vessels building for the navy include
nine destroyers, twenty-nine subma
rines and several fuel and supply
ships. Three of these destroyers are
almost finished, five are about half
completed, and one has only just
been started. Thirteen submarines
are nearly completed and the rest are
well under way. The three big ships
and three of th'e destroyers are being
built in government yards.
There is a good chance for civili
ans now to get into the navy as offi
cers. The Secretary has been em
powered to appoint annually for ten
years thirty ensigns in the engineer
ing department. The first examina
tions for these appointments will be
held next January. Any of these ap
pointees who completes a three-year
probationary period, two of which
are to be spent on board cruising ves
sels and ohe at the Naval Academy,
is then to be commissioned as lieu
tenant of the'junior grade. The offi
cers so promoted will be required to
perform engineering duties only, but
will be eligible to advancement to the
higher grades in the manner provided
for line'officers assigned to engineer
ing duty.
Formerly when an enlisted man
in the National Guard changed his
residence in the State and was unable
to attend drills at his armory, he re
ceived a discharge from his regiment.
This has now been changed. If he
removes to another city in the same
State, instead of giving up his mem
bershp in the National Guard, he is
transferred to another organization
near his new home. If there is no
National Guard organization near his
new residence, he is furloughed to
the reserve and isa member of the
militia anyway.
An enlisted man has now -a chance
to leave the National Guard only by
removal to another State. If he
doesn't want to leave it, the adjutant
general will make some arrangement
to keep him in. It should work nicely
both ways.
All food is now high priced, but the
highest priced of all is the diamond
back terrapin. The Baltimore American
explains that a full-grown terrapin
makes Just about four good portions, but
not a meal, for other edibles are usually
served with it. The American says that
the terrapin costs in the neighborhood
of 110. It is not said whether this means
$10 to the caterer or $10 to the bonsumer;
but suppose it is the price to the on
sumer; then this feast starts out at
81.0 a plate, and nothing said as to wines
or other accessories. It must be admit
ted that terrapin travels on the ridge
pole of the high cost of living.-Mobile
Register.
If Germany is not winning any victortes
of account from the air, it might be
thought, from the announcement that
shipping in the amount of over 11,500 tons
was sunk yesterday, that the renewed
activities of her submarines were tending
to laosen her enemy's grip on the sea.
But examination fails to show any
achievements of substantial value to her
cause. The victims were either neutral
crafi or British merchant ships of com
paratively small tonnage. It is beom
ing increasingly evident that the result of
this war Is not golnt to he decided by
Zeppelins and suenarines, however spec

The organisation of the machine gun

Like Clockwork!
(By N. B. Cook. I. D.)
The machinery of the body -needs to
lbe oiled, kept in good condition just as
the automobile or bicycle. Why should
the human neglect his own machinery
more than that of his horse or his en
gine? Yet most people do neglect
themselves. Their tongue has a dark
brown color, skin sallow, breath bad,
yet they fail to see that their machinery
needs attention. Everybody should take
a mild laxative at least once a week. A
pleasant way to clear the tongue and
the highly colored water noticed in the
mornings is to take a laxative which
will cure the inactive liver and bilious
ness.
A pleasant vegetable pill is made up
of May-apple. leaves of aloes, and
jalap, made into a tiny pellet and
coated with sugar. First put up by Dr.
Pierce nearly 5o years ago. Druggssts
sell these vegetable pellets in vials, sim
ply ask for Dr. Pierce's Pleasant
Pellets.
If backache, scalding urine or fre
quent urination bother or distress you,
or if uric acid in the blood has caused
rheumatism, gout or sciatica, if you
suspect that you have kidney or blad
der trouble, write Dr. Pierce, at In
valids' Hotel, Buffalo, N. Y., send a
sample of urine, and describe symp
toms. A physician and chemist will ex
amine it without charge and you will
be under no obligation whatever. Dr.
Pierce's Anuric tablets cannot fail t
help you, because their action flushes
the kidneys of impurities and puts
