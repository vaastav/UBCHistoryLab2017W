Tbe Fifty-ninth Congress assem
bled in Washington on Monday of
this week, and from the amount of
work before it the prospects are
that it will be a. long and import
ant session. Railroad legislation,
tariff revision and reciprocity treat
ies, the Panama canal, laws affect
ing our insular possessisns, new
statehood measures, are among the
important matters to be consider
ed. It is not expected that any
extensive revision of the tariff will
be attempted at this session, as
other matters of more pressing im
portance will occupy the time, but
a few minor changes will probably
be made in the present schedule.
The transportation question seems
to be the leading issue, and will
probably receive the most atten
tion and arouse the greatest public
interest.
Several high school girls of Yank
ton were discovered one day last
week conversing through the bars
with the negro convict, Carr, who
was confined in the county jail.
Carr and his fellow prisoners in
some way got possession of some
tools with which they attempted to
break jail, and there was some sus
picion that the tools had been giv
en to them by these girls, although
the county sheriff does not credit
this charge. As the girls are from
prominent families the names are
withheld from the public. It may
have been simply indiscretion on
the part of these young women,
but such indiscretions lead to
crime, and the suspicion that now
rests upon these girls should serve
as a warning to foolish young
women everywhere to avoid "even
the appearance ol evil.

In his speech in Akron, Ohio,
Secretary Taft told the people that
"William J. Bryan would become
the successful leader of the demo
cratic party and a menace to the
prosperity of the country unless
something should be accomplished
by President Roosevelt." This is
not only a significant statement,
but it is a compliment to the Ne
braska. democrat, and, reading be
tween the lines of the utterance,
the fact stands out that the "some
thing" President Roosevelt must
do to prevent democratic success
in the nation is to carry .out the re
forms for which Bryan stands and
which have given birth to the term.
—New Orleans State.
Such reading between the lines
is certainly a novelty. If the
"something" that was meant by
Sec. Taft was "to carry out the re
forms for which Bryan stands"
how could he claim that Mr. Bry
an was likely to become "a menace
to the prosperity of the country
What reforms has Mr. Bryan ad
vocated that are now endorsed by
Mr. Roosevelt Bryan favored free

Pres. Roosevelt? What Mr. Taft
plainly means is tbat tbe people
demand some reforms they pre
fer those advocated by Pres. Roose
velt, but if congress refuses to
grant them they may at the next
election, as a rebuke to the repub
licans, endorse Bryanism, which
would be a menace to the prosper
ity of the country.
For the seventh consecutive year
South Dakota comes forward with
the claim of having produced more
wealth per capita than any other
state in the union. Owing to the
census having been taken this year
the estimates can be more accur
ately made this year than during
the past four, and Doane Robin
son, secretary of the census, gives
us the following results Popula
tion 455,185. Wealth produced
$126,680,201, an increase of $10,
000,000 over last year, and an av
erage production of §278 for every
man, woman and child in the
state.
