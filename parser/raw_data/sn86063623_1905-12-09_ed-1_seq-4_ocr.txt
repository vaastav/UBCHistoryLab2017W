Hannibal is to name Its new sixty
thouand aollar hotel Mark Twain.
The governor lias appointed Andrew
Maroney, formerly his asM,iut in
the prosecutor, s office, to succeed
Richard IlanL.n on the Hoard or
Police Commissi. npis of St. Louis.
It would h ive L'fuo fjraeutLl if the
president had seen tit to apologize tn
Jud-e Parker, Id connection with the
insurance clause of his message, f.
what he said about him the day before
the election.
Governor LaFullette has decided to
accert the senatorship from Wiscon
sin. He will resign the governorship
during the present special session of
the legislature, which he called to
enact some special railroad legislation.
The president has appointed Frank
lin Lane of Pan Francisco to rill the
place of former Governor Fifer of
Illinois on the Interstate Commerce
Commission. Lane is said to be a
Roosevelt democrat, whatever that la.
Congressman William Lorrlmer, of
Illinois, is author of a bill which he
introduced In Congress Monday to
deepen the Mississippi river between
the mouth of the Chicago drainage
canal and the Gulf of Mexico to four
teen feet. He has estimated the
cost at $31,000,000.
Ilenry Wattersoo says that sooner
or later the tariff Issue will do for the
repubilcao party what the slavery
issue did for the democratic party
years ago. Undoubtedly the time is
coming when ths question of tariff
reform will take on a moral aspect
and when the republican party will
bave to choose between braving a
moral uprising and deserting the
patrons whom it has served for a
price.
Representative Lloyd, of Missouri,
hrts introduced a bill in Congress pro
viding for a joint resolution submit
ting to the states for ratification an
amendment to the constitution under
which senators would be elected by a
direct vote of the people. Such a
bill has passed the house every vear
for eleven years but has always has
always failed In the senate. Mr.
Lloyd hopes that It may pass the
senate this year.
The newspapers generally are much
amused at the behavior of the Kansas
City Star's Congressman Ellis, who
has asked Speaker Cannon for a place
on the Rivers and Harbors Commit
tee, or If this is Impossible then the
Appropriations Committee, or If this
may not be, the Postoflices and Post
roads Committee. Of course Ellis
stands about as much chance of being
chosen Pope of Rome as of getting on
any of these committees.
Balfour has resigned the premier
ship of England and Sir Ilenry
Campbell-Bannerman has been asked
to try to form a cabinet. For years
and years Sir Ilenry was the stormy
petrel of the British parliament. He
was a sort of Albert J. Beverage and
John James Ingalls combined. He
delighted in "rough bouse" like' a
little boy. lie never minded getting
the worst of it in violent debates, so
be got Into the fray. In recent years
he has settled down somewhat, and
after the stagnant calm of Balfour's
administration tbe country seems to
welcome Sir Ilenry.
The union of New Mexico and
Arizona preliminary to their admis
sion as one state is not to be justified
in tbe flippant manner in which the
president treats the subject In hie
message. The people of the two
territories do not want single state
hood. The interests of the terri
tories are not Identical. New Mexico
will always be pastoral and agricul
tural. Arizona Is or will be almost
exclusively given to mining, lumber
ing and ultimately manufacture.
More than half of the inhabitants of
New Mexico are Mexicans. The labor
will always bo Mexican. The people
of Arizona are nearly all American.
Both of tbe territoiies are very much
more populous than some of the
state of long standing. There is no
reason why the wishes of the people
should be disregarded except insure
against a possibility of two democratic
eouUrs,
THE PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE.
President Roosevelt's message to
the 59th congress is the longest
message ever sent by a president. It
is not as in-tpresting or as well written
as the one of two years ago, but it
deals frankly with questions of
present interest to the public and
with constructive policies. One
thing may be said of all of Mr.
Riosevelt's communications that be
is usually in favor of doing something
For another thing, it may be said
that the moral aspect of public
questions usually gets more attention
trom the president than the economic
The president asks congress to pass
laws to prevent over-capitalization of
railroads: to irive the Interstate
commerce commission the authority
to fix a maximum railroad freight
rate upon the corap'alnt of a shipper
subiect to review bv the courts; to
prevent railroad rebates; to put
private car lines under the supervision
of the commission; to require the
railroads to use the Block signal
system and other safety appliances;
to limit the working hours ol railroad
employees. The president preaches
a sermon on Capital and Labor but
makes no specific recommendations of
consequence, lie discusses insurance
and urges congress to annex this
business In some way but does not
suggest the way. He announces a
stand pat tariff policy, urges economy
In appropriations, and some sort of
flexible currency legislation which
will insure currency expansion in
winter and contraction in summer,
ne wants a law passed to prohibit
corporation campaign contributions,
gives a long dissertation on peace
and war, and brings the Monroe
doctrine down to date.
Ills recommendations under tbe
head of Army and Navy are specific
and radical. He insists upon
appropriations to enable ibe army to
be assembled from time to time for
large general nianuevers for the
Instruction of officers; be wants the
system of linear promotion abolished
and the merit system adopted; be
wants the medical department of tbe
army entirely overhauled and greatly
Improved and enlarged. One new
battleship a year, he thinks, will be
sufficient, if to this is added, tbe
replacing of the old ships as fast as
they go out of date. He pleads for
tbe torpedo boat, submarine' boat
and other smaller craft of war, 'in
which he thinks our navy is deficient.
He wants liberal appropriation for
target practice at sea..
One of the best things in the mes
sage is the -president's treatment of
the naturalization laws and the sug
gestions of amendment. He also
complaioB ' of the criminal statutes
and of the worn out rules of criminal
procedure. He is indefinite in his
recommendations as to amendment of
the public land laws, though he says
that the present laws are bad. He
favors the ship subsidy scheme of
building up our merchant marine
He treats tbe general subject of
Immigration gingerly, though at
much length, and the subject of
Chinese immigration with fairness
and clearness. He makes specific
recommendations as to Indian legisla
tion rendered necessary by changed
conditions in the Indian Territory,
ne makes a show of liberality by
urging tbe removal of duties upon
Philippine importations except sugar
and tobacco which are about the only
things imported from tbe Philippines.
He wants Hawaii fortified and the
Porto Rlcans enfranchised. Alaska
should have representation in
congress, he says, and tbe four
remaining territories of the Uuited
States should be admitted as two
etates.
The last recommendation of tbe
message is one of the wisest. He
wants the state department thoroughly
overhauled, the salary list adjusted,
the consuls classified, and the
representation of this country abroad
rendered vastly more creditable and
efficient.
The message h too sermonlc and is
too evidently addressed to the people
Instead of to congress. Many of the
subjects appear to bave been dragged
in, like the subject of Insurance,
merely to show that he had not over
looked them. He has backed squarely
down on the subject of tariff reform
and he has gone over to the enemy
on the subject of ship subsidies.
Sam B. Cook got judgement last
week against the Globe-Democrat for
$150,000 damages and has a case
against the Post Dispatch set for
trial In Boone county this month in
which be claims JtOO.OOO damages.
If he collects thei sum of the judg
ments he will be able to get along for
a few years without the good will of
the dally press.
Hard times are wide spread In
Europe. In Spain and Italy crop
failure has produced great suffering
Id Russia both political and industrial
conditions have been at their worst
for three years. In Germany the
agrarians bave had control of the
legislative branch of the go ernment
for several years and have Imposed
tariff duties in the interest of the
farmers to the great dissatisfaction
of townspeople. In Austria both
political and industrial conditions are
alarming, and it Is feared that the
death of the emperor, which Is likely
to happen shortly, may be the signal
for a bloody revolution. England is
at the lowest ebb Industrially.
There is more poverty, suffering and
lack of employment than at any
other time for a hundred and fifty
years. Toe unemployed of London
have for months been making
threatening demojstratlons and
demanding that they be set to work
upon some government undertaking.
United Stales, Canada and Mexico
seem to be the exceptions among the
nations. Ia these coun'les unusual
prosperity is being enjoyed. Those
who have hard and fast theories as to
the causes of these conditions find no
support for their theories la the cases
presented. The United States has
the gold standard and high tariff
Mexico has tbe silver standard and
moderate tariff. Canada has gold
standard and moderate tariff.
England has free trade and gold
standard. Germany, Russia and
Austria have gold standard and high
tariff.
S. C. Neale, foimerly proprietor of
the Hlgglnsville Leader, afterward
secretary to Congressman Hamlin,
has gone back into the newspaper
business and will edit tbe Sweet
Springs Herald. Mr. Neale was a
successful oewspaper man, and it is
believed by his friends that he will
do well with the Herald, giving the
people of Sweet Springs and vicinity
a useful newspaper and securing for
himself a proper ret urn for his efforts.

Chiropractic, the Natural Method of
Adjusting the Caue, Nature
Curing All Ailments.
By relieving the pressure on the
nerves it frees thera, thereby permit
tins all injurious matter lobe thrown
out of the body. The cause is treated,
not the effect. Since the attentijn
of tbe people of Lexington and
vicinity was first culled to Chiro
practic, the new method of adjust
log tbe cause of riisiase without
the use of knife or drugs, as much
interest has been awakened In it as
prevails elsewhere, where it Is better
k iOwn and where In hundreds of
cases cures have been effected which
were little short of miraculous
The Chiropractor justs and re
moves the cause of disease. He does
not treat te effect. The Chiropnc-,
tor claims that the scat nf all disease
is to be fuu' d in the vertebrae of the
spine, ami the cause is the abnormal
position of oie or mure of the vctte
Urao, tnereby bringing about some
kind of ailment or ciisense In tbat
portion of the body to which ;t Is the
function of that pariiiul ir neve to
supply nerve force. A decrease in
the quantity of nerve force is at one
followed by a diminished circulation
of the blood tD such an extent that
the impurities and poisons cannot be
carrif d off, and the affected parts are
attacked by disease. The Chiroprac
tor adjusts with his hands and re
leases the nerve from pressure, thus
enabling the part to receive normal
amount of nerve force and circulation
W. II. Reynolds, the Cuiropractor,
has given quite a number of adjust
ments since locating in Lexington
and a great deal of Interest has been
manifested In the work he is doing
A case of rheumatism which he
handled successfully after other
methods bad repeatedly failed was
tbat of Mike Cahill who had suffered
for a number of years. Next Wednes
day W. H. Reynolds will give a free
demonstration at his otlice of tbe
method of adjusting the cause of dis
ease by Chiropractic, freely explain
ing the new science and at tbe same
time treat free all who desire it.
