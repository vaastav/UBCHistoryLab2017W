Washington, Dec. 3. Following' is
President Cleveland's message to the
second session of the Fiftv-third con-
press:
To the Congress of the United States:
Th? assemblage within the nation's legisla
tive !ialls of those charged with the duty of
making laws for the benefit of a generous and
free people Impressively suggests the exacting
obligation and inexorable responsibility In
volved in their task. At the threshold of such
labor now to be undertaken bv the congress of
the United States, and In the discharge of an
executive duty enjoined by the constitution. I
submit this communication, containing a brief
statement of the condition of our national af
fairs and recommending such legislation as
eems to mo necessary and expedient.
Our Foreign Kelatlon.
The history of our recent dealings with other
nations and our peaceful relations with them
ntf this time additionally demonstrated the ad
vantage of consistently adhering to a Arm but
just foreign policy, free from envious or am
bitious national schemes and characterized by
enure noncsty ana sincerity.

nations to adhere to them. Favorable re
sponses have thus far been received from Aus
tria, France. Portugal. Spain and Sweden.
In my last annual message I referred briefly
to the unsatisfactory state of affairs in Samoa
under the operation of the Berlin treaty, as
signally illustrating the policy of entangling
alliances with foreign powers: and on May V.
191. In response to a resolution of the senate I
sent a special message and documents to that
body on same subject which emphasized my
previously expressed opinions. Later occur
rences, the correspondence in regard to which
will be laid before congress, further demon
strated that the government which was devised
by the three powers and forced upon the
Samoans against their Inveterate hostility can
be maintained only by the continued presence
of foreign military force and at no small sacri
fice of life and treasure. The suppression of
the Mataafa insurrection by the powers, and
the subsequent banishment of the leader and
seven other chiefs, as recited in my last mes
sage, did not bring lasting peace to the islands.
Formidable uprisings continued and Anally a
rebellion broke out in thccapital island. Upolu,
headed In Anna, tho western district, by the
younger Tamascsc, and in Atua. the eastern
district, by other leaders. The insurgents
ravaged the country and fought the govern
ment troops up to the very doors
of Apia. The king again appealed to tho
powers for help and the cocibined British and
German naval forces reduced the Atuar.s to ap

ports received from our agents at Apia do not
justify the belief that the p?acc thus brought
about will be of long duration. It is their con
viction that the native? arc at heart hostile to
the present got ernment: that such of them as
profess loyalty to It do so from fear of the
powers, and that it would .speedily go to pieces
If the warships were withdrawn. In re
porting to thLs government on the unsatis
factory situation since the suppression of the
late revolt by forc'gn armed forces, the Ger
man consul at Apia stated:
That pcaec will be lasting Is hardly to be
presume J. The lesson given by tiring on Atua
was not .sufficiently sharp and incisive to leave
a lasting impression on the forgetful Samoan
tempc-ament In fact conditions arc existing
which show that peace will not last and is not
seriously Intended. Jlalietoa. the king, and
fan government the needlessncss and positive
liarmfulness of its restrictions upon tho im
portation of certain of our food products and
have strongly urged that the rigid" supervision
and Inspection under our laws nre amply suf
ficient to prevent the deportation from this
country of diseased cattle and unwholsomo
meat.
On the 1 7th of March last a new treaty with
China in further regulation of emigration was
signed at Washington and on August 13 it re
ceived the sanction of the scaate.
Acting upon the reported dis.-ov cry of Texas
fever in cargoes of American cattle the Gcr
imn prohibition against importations of live
stock and fresh meats from this country has
been revived. It is hoped that Germany will
soon become convinced that the inhibition Is
asnecdlcs as it is harmful to mutual iutcr--ests.
The German gov eminent has protested
again! I'aat. provision or the customs tariff net
ments, through tho reorganization of the sys
tem of recruiting and the consequent release
to'reglmcntal duty of the large forco of men
hitherto serving at the recruiting departments.
The abolition of these departments, it Is pre
dicted, win furthermore effect an annual re
duction approximating fcW),Otin the direct
expenditures, besides promoting generally the
health, morals and discipline of the troops.
The execution of the policy of concentrating
the army at Important centers of popu
litlon and transportation, foreshadowed
in the last annual report of the secre
tary, has resulted in the abandonment
of fifteen of the smaller posts, which was ef
fected under a plan which assembles organiza
tions of the same regiments hitherto widely
separated. This renders our small forces more
readily effective for any service which theymay
be called upon to perform In cases over the ex
tent of territory under protection without
diminishing the security heretofore afforded to
any locality; improves the discipline, training
and esprit dc corps of the army, besides consid
erably decreasing the cost of its maintenance.
Though tho force of the department has been
somewhat Increased, more than three-fourths
of the army is still stationed wet of the Mis
sissippi. Tills carefully matured policy which
secures the best and greatest service in the In
terests of the general welfare from the small
force comprising our regular army should not
be thoughtlessly embarrassed by the creation
of new and unnecessary posts through act-, of
congress to gratify the ambitions or interests
of localities. While the maximum legal
strength of the army Ls 25,009 men tho effective
strength, through various cause. Is but little
over 20,00) men. The purpose of congress does

ests of the commerce of both countries and to
swoid even the accusation of fcaty v iolation,
I recommend the repeal of so much of the
statute as imposes that duty and I invito at
tention to the accompanj ing report of the
secretary of state containing a discussion of
the questions raised by flic German protests.
Karly in the present year an acreement was
reached with Greatllritaiiiconccrninglnstruc
tions to be given to the naval commanders of
the two governments in Behring sea and the
contiguous North Pacific ocean for their guid
ance in the execution or the award of the Paris
tribunal of arbitration and the enforcement of
the regulations therein prescribed for the pre
lection of seal life in the waters mentioned.
Since communicating the voluminous corrc
spondence In regard to Hawaii and the action
taken by the senate and house of representa
tives on certain questions submitted to the
judgment and wider discretion of congress the
organization of a government in place of the
provisional arrangement which followed the
deposition of the queen has been announced
with evidence of its effective operation. The
recognition usual in such eases has been ac
corded the new government.
Apart from the war In which the island em
pire is engaged, Japan attracts Increasing at
tention in this country by her evident desire
to cultivate more liberal intercourse with us
and to seek our kindly aid in furtherance of her
laudable desire for complete autonomy in her
-domestic affairs and full equality in the family
-of nations. The Japanese empire of to-day Is
no longer the Japan of the past and our rela
tions with this progressive nation should not
be less broad and liberal than those with other
powers; good will, fostered by many interests
in common, has marked our relations with our
aicarest southern neighbor.
Peace being restored along her northern fron
tier, Mexico has asked the punishment of the
late disturbers of her tranquility. There ought
to be a new treaty of commerce and navigation
with that country to take the place of the one
which terminated thirteen years ago. The
friendliness of the intercourse between the
two countries is attested by the fact during
this long period. The commerce cf each has
steadily increased under the rule of mutual
consideration, being neither stimulated by
-conventional arrangements nor returned by
jealous rivalries or selfish desires.
Peru, I regret to say, shows symptoms of do
mestic disturbance, probably due to the
slowness of her recuperation from the war of
JSS1. Weakened in resources, her difficulties
in facing Internationa! obligations invite our
"Kindly sympathy and justify our forbearance
in pressing long pending claims. I have felt
constrained to testify this sympathy in connec
tion with certain demands urgently preferred
.by other powers.
The recent death of the czar of Russia called
Torth appropriate expressions of sorrow and
sympathy on the part of our gov eminent with
his bereaved family and the Russian people.
s a further demonstration of respect and
friendship our minister at St Petersburg was
directed to represent our government at the
funeral ceremonies. The scaling interests of
Russia in the Behring sea are second only to
our own. A modus v ivcncU has therefore been
concluded with the imperial government re
strictive of poaching on Russian rookeries and
of scaling in waters which were not compre
hended In the protected area defined In the
Paris award. Occasion has been found to
sirge upon the Russian government equal
ity of treatment for our great life in
surance companies whose operations have
Ijcen extended throughout Kurope. Ad
mitting, as wn do, foreign corporations to
transact business in the United States, wo
naturally expect no less tolerance for our own
in the ample fields o: competition abroad. But
few cases of interference with naturalized cit
izens returning to Russia have been reported
during the current year. One Krzeminski
was arrested last summer In a Polish prov
ince, on a reported charge of unpermitted re
nunciation of Russian allegiance, but it trans
pired that the proceedings originated in al
leged malfeasance committed by Krzeminski
with an imperial official a number of years ago.
Efforts for his release, which promised to be
successful, were in progress when his death
was reported.
The government of Salvador having been
overthrown by an abrupt popular outbreak,
certain of its military and civil officers, while
hotly pursued by infuriated Insurgents sought
refuge on board the United States war ship
Bennington, then lying in a Salvadoran port,
although the practice of asylum Is not favored
by thlsgovernment.yetin view ofthc imminent
peril which threatened the fugitives and solely
from considerations of humanltv. they were
afforded shelter by our naval commander and
when atterwards demanded under our treatv
of extradition with Salvador for trial on
charges of murder, arson and robbery. I direct-
ed that such of them as had no: voluntarily
left the ship be conveyed to one of our nearest
ports where a hearing eould be had before a
judicial officcrn compliance with terms of the
treaty. Oa their arrival at San Francisco such
a proceeding was promptly instituted before
the United States district judge who held that
the acts constituting the alleged offences were
lolitlcaI and discharged all the accused except
Cienfueguos, who was held for an atrempt to
murder. Thereupon I was constrained to di
rect his release, for the reason that an attempt
to murder was not one of the crimes charged
against him and upon which his surrender to
the Salvadoran authorities had been de
manded. In my last annual message I adverted to the
claim on the part of Turkey of the right to ex
pel as persons undesirable and dangerous Ar--menians
naturalized in the United States and
returning to Turkish jurisdiction. Numerous
questions in this relation hav e arisen. While
this government acquiesces in the asserted right
of expulsion it will not consent that Armenians
may be imprisoned or otherwise punished for
no other reason than having acquired without
Imperial consent American citizenship. Three
of the assailants of Miss Melton, an American
teacher in Mosul, have been convicted by the
Ottoman courts and I am advised that an ap
peal against the acquittal of the remaining live
has been taken by the Turkish prosecution offi
cers. A convention has been concluded with Ven
ezuela for the arbitration of a long disputed
claim growing out of the seizure of certain ves
sels, the property of citizens of the United
-States. Although signed, the treaty of extra
edition with Venezuela is not yet in force, ow

The rales for tne prevention of collision at

war. The circumstances that the representa
tives of the villages of all the districts
which were opposed to the gov ernment have al

both Atua and Aasa have forbidden inhabitants
of those districts which fought on the side of
the government to return to their villages and
have already partly burned down the latter In
dicates th.it a real conciliation of the parties is
still far off. And in a note of the 10th ult, in
closing a copy of that rcwrt for the informa
tion of the government, the German ambassa
dor said: The contents of the reports awak
ened the imperial government s apprehension
that under existing circumstances the peace
concluded with the rebels will afford no assur
ance of the lasting restoration of tranquility in
the islands. The present government utterly
failed to correct. If Indeed It has not aggravat

by this government looking to the withdrawal
of its engagents with the other powers on .some
reasonable terms not prejudicial to any of our
existing rights.
Treasury Statement.
The secretary of the treasury reports that
the receipts of the treasury from all sources of
revenue during the fiscal year ended June 30,
1691, amounted to $372.S.K.1;3.'. and Its expend
itures to $4K,t05.TSS.S7. leaving a deficit of $69,
803,2(30.58. There was a decrease of J1.1.0-.2.C74.-GG
in the ordinary expenses of the government,
as compared with the fiscal year 1S9.1. There
was collected from customs jl31.8I8-soa, and
from internal revenue SHr,163,149.SJ. The bal
ance of the income for the year, amounting to
S33.S15.517.P7. was derived from the sales of
lands and other sources. The value of our to
tal dutiable imports amounted to S-i7J.lW.03S.
being l46.C37,62o less than during the preced
ing year and the importations free of duty
amounted to S379.793.XM. being Jtil.7lS.C7T) less
than during the preceding year. The receipts
from customs were $r3,WJ.13ill less and from
internal rev cnueSl3.833.T3) 97 less than in 1S93.
The total tax cpllectcd from distilled spirits
was SS5.259.2 0.23. oa manufactured tobacco,
JS,617,83S.C2, and oa fermented liquors. $31,114,
7SS01. Our exports of merchandise, domestic and
foreign, amounted during the year to 5SK.140,
572. being an increase over the preceding year
of 5:4,495.378. The total amount of gold ex
ported during the fiscal year was $76.sV3,031. as
against 3ICS.CS0.441 during the fiscal year 1S33.
The amount imported was 72.4KU19.asagainst
$2I,174,3S1 during the previous year. The im
ports of silver were Jl::jS3,Vii. and the exports
were $50,451,203. The total bounty paid upon
tho production of sugar in the Unit-Hi States
for the fiscal year was U.103,i)6.SJ, being an
increase of Si.7i5.07i.01 over the payments
made during the preceding year. The amount
of bounty paid from July 1, 1S9I. to August 2S.
1S94. the time when further payments ceased
by operation of law. was JtoJ.l'O'.si. The total
expenses incurred in the payment of the
bounty upon sugar during the fiscal year was
$130,140.85. It is estimated that upon the basis
ofthc present revenue laws the receipts of the
government during the current fiscal year
ending June 39, 18J3. will be J4i4,4i7,7is.44.
and its expenditures lll.4-i7,74s.4l, resulting
in a deficit of SiO.OCO.OJO. The first day or No

circulation or not included in the treasury
holdings was l.C72,093.4ii. or fil.27 per capita

521.32, an average cost of $0.7313 per fine ounce.
The total amount of silver purchased from the
time that law took effect until the repeal of its
purchasing clause on the date last mentioned
was ICS.674,682.53 fine ounces, which cost 4153,
931,002.23. the average price per ounce being
S-9241. The total amount of standard silver
dollars coined at the mints of tho United
States since the passage of the act of February
23, 1893, is Slil.7T3.408. of which $373,163 793 were
coined under the provisions of that act, $33,-
531.143 under the provisions of the act of July
11, 1KW, and S5,078.478 under the act providing
for the coinage of trade dollar bullion: the to
tal coinage of all metals at our mints during
the last fiscal year coasistjsj of 03,483.220

of $3aS500, and seventy-nine, with a capital of
$10,475,009, went Into voluatary liquidation.
Twenty-one banks, with a capital of $I.7TJ,000,

sources of the banks at the date mentioned
amounted to $3,473,922,055, as against $3,109.
563,281.36 in 1893.
Army Affairs.
From the report of the secretary of war It
appears that the strength of the army on Sep
tember 30, 1894, was 2.135 officers and 25,765 en
listed men. Although this is apparently a very
crease in the array is In my judgment demand
ed by recent events.
The iwlicy of sea coast fortifications in pros
ecution or which vv c have been steadily engaged
for some years past has so far developed as to
suggest that the effective strength of the army
be now made at least e-jual to the legal strength.
Measures taken bv the department during the
year, as indicated, have already augmented the
effcctlvo force, and the secretary of war pre
sents a pun, which I recommend to the consid
eration of congress, to attain the desired cad.
Economics effected in the department in other
lines of Its work will offset to a great extent
the cspcaditurc involved iu the proposition
submitteJ. Among other things this contem
plates the adoption of the three battalion for
mation of regiment which for several years has
been indorsed by the secretaries of warand the
gcncr.'ls commanding the army. Compact i.i
Itself, it provides a skeleton organization ready
to be billed out in the event or v.-ar, which is
pcculiarlj adapted to our strength and require
ments; and the Tact that every other nation,
with a single exception, has adopted this for
mation to uicct the conditions of inod-'rn war
faro, should alono secure for the recommenda
tion an early co.isldcration. It ish-irdly nec
essary to recall the fact that in obedience to
the constitution and the laws ami ror the pur
pose of protecting the property of the
United States aiding the process of
federal courts and removing lawless obstruc
tions to the performance by the government of
its legitimate functions it became necessary In
various localities during the year to emplov a
considerable portion or the regular troops. The
duty was discharged promptly, courageously
and with marked discretion by the officers anil
men and the most gratifying proor was thus af
forded that the army deserves that complete
confidence in its efficiency and discipline which
tho country has at all times manifested.
The total expenditures for the war depart
ment for the year ending Juno :. 1891.
amounted to $56 039.009.34. Of thls sum, 2.000.
014 99 was for salaries and contingent expen
ses; $23.66,I36.16 for the support of tho military
establLshmcnt: $3,001,632.23 for miscellaneous
objects, and 323.37 1 .535.W3 for public works.
Tills latter sum Includes $19.43 1,0.17. 19 for river
and harbor Improvements and 33,9!7.S03.50 for
fortifications and other works of defense.
The appropriations for the eurrent voar ag
gregate $3 i. 129.1 12.78. and the estimates sub
mitted by the secretary of war foe the next fis
cal year call for appropriations amounting to
$52,318,529.55.
The skill nnl industry of our ordnance offi
cers and inventors have, it is believed, over
come the mechanical obstacles which have
heretofore delayed the armament of our coasts.
and this great national undertaking upon v hich
wenavecntercJ may now proceed as rapidly
as congress shall determine, with a supply of
finished guns of large caliber already on hand
to which additions should now rapidly follow.
The wisdom of providing carriages and em
placements for their mount cannot be-too-strongly
urged. The total enrollment of tho
militia of the several states is 117.7.U officers
and enlisted men. an bicrease of 3.343 over lha
number reported at the close or the previous
year. The reports or militia Inspection by
regulararmy officers show- a marked increase
in interest and efficiency among the state or
ganizations, and I strongly recommend a con
tinuance or tho policy of affording every prac
tical encouragement possible to this important
auxiliary of our military establishment The
condition of tho Apache Indians, held as prison
ers by the government for eight j ears at a cost
of half a million dollars, has been changed dur
ing the year from captivity to one which gives
them an opportunity to demonstrate their
capacity for self-support and at least
partial civilization. Legislation enacted
at the late session of congress gave
the war department authority to transfer
In recognition or the long and distinguished
military services and faithful discharge of
delicate and responsible civil duties by Maj.
Gen. John M. Schoticld. now the general com
manding tho army, it ts suggcst;d to congress
that tho temporary revival of the grade of
lieutenant general in hLs behalf would be a
just and gracious act. and would permit hLs re
tirement now near at hand with rank befitting
his merits.
Tho Department of Justice.
The report of the attorney-general notes the
gratifying progress made by the supreme court
in overcoming the arrears or its business and
In reaching a condition in which it will be able
to dispose of cases as they arise without any
unreasonable delay. This result Is of coarse
very largely due to tho successful working of
the plan inaugurating circuit courts of appeals.
In respect to these tribunals the suggestion is
made in quarters entitled to the highest con
sideration that an additional circuit judge for
each circuit would greatly strengthen
these courts and the confidence
reposed In their adjudication. and
that such an addition would not create a
greater fores of julges than ths increasing
business or such courts requires. The perma
nent solution or what is called the IntHan prob
lem is probably not to be expected at once, but
meanwhile such ameliorations of present con
ditions as the existing system will admit ought
not to be neglected--1 am satisfied there should
be a federal court established for the territory
with sufficient judges and that this court should
sit within the territory and have the same jur
isdiction as to territorial affairs as is now
vested in the federal courts sitting in Arkansas
and Texas.
Another subject or presstng moment referred
to by the attorney -general Is the reorganiza
tion of the Union Pacific Railroad Co. on
a basis equitable as regards all private inter
ests and as favorable to thegovernment as ex
isting conditions will permit. The operation
of a railroad by a court through a receiver is
an anomalous state of things which should be
terminated on all grounds, public and private,
at the earliest possible moment
It lsnotmy purpose at this time to repeat
the considerations which make an Inpregnable
case in favor of the ownership and manage
ment by the government of the penal Institu
tions In which federal prisoners are confined.
I simply desire to again urge former recom
mendations on the subject and to particularly
call the attention of the congress toth.it part
of the report of the secretary of war. In which
he states that the military prison at Fort
Leavenworth. Kaa.t can be turned over to the
government as a prison for fcJeral convicts
without the least difficulty and w ith au actual
saving of money from ev ery point of v lew.
Post Office Affairs.
The report or the postmaster-general pre
sents a comprehensh e statement ol the opera
tions or the post office department for the last
fiscal year. The receipts of the department
during the year amounted to $75,083,479.01 and
the expenditures of $31.3M,414.15. The trans
actions of tho postal service indicate with
barometric certainty the fluctuations In busi
nesses of the country. Inasmuch, therefore, as
business complications continued to exist
the last year to an unforeseen extent it Is
not surprising that the deficiency or revenues
to meet the expenditures or the post office
department, which was estimated in advap.ee
at about $8,000,033. snould bs exoeeded by
nearly $1,250,000. The ascertained "revenues of
the last year, which were the basis of calcula
tion for the current year, being less than esti
mated, the deficiency for the current year will
be correspondingly greater, though the post-master-general
states that the latest indica
tions are so favorable that he confident!? nre-
dicts an increase of at least 8 per cent In the
revenues of the current year over those of the
last year. The expenditures increase steadily
and necessarily with the growth and
needs of the country, so that the defi
ciency Is greater or less In any year
count of Insufficient funds. 'Vhi expanse of
free delivery for the current fiscal jear will be
more than 3I2J90,OM, and under existing lejri -lation
this item of expenditure is subject to
constant increase-. The estimated cotof rural
free delivery generally is so verv large that it
ought not to bo considered in the present con
dition or affairs. During the your 8!0:uldl
tionii domestic m.iney order oees were cs
tablishei The total number of these offlcir
at the close or the jear was 19.26! There were
1 1.301,011 money orders issued during the year.
being an increase over tho preeediaycarof
991,303. Tho value of these oriles amounted
to 3113,793.379. 49. an Increase of 31 1.217.21
There were also Issued during the ycarpost.il
notes amounting to $12,619,031.9). During the
year 213 international nionev order offices were
added to those already established, making a
total of 2,C2such oillces in operation June Jo,
1891. The number of international taoncv or
ders issued during tho ycarwa-. U17.8i. a de
crease in number of 133.176. and their value
was $13.79 2.45-1.31.. -i decrease In amount of 32.

180. an increase over the preceding j ear of 03,
263, and their value was J6.3C3.49.l73. an in
crease Of 11.235,1 18.05. From the foregoing
statements it appears that the total issue of
money orders and potal notes for the .vear
amounted to $16,23i,l29.3. The number of let
ters anil pickages malffd durl'ig the year for
special delivery was 3,436.970. The special de
livery stamps used upon these letters and
packages amounted to $313,637. The messen
gers' foes pa id for their delivery amounted to
$261,200.70. leaving a balance in favor of the
government of S82.4S7.3). The report shows
most gratifying results in the w ay of economies
in the cost and amount of supplies used In the
service, amounting in all to 316,619.017.42.
The report also contains a valuable contri
bution to the history ol the universal nostal
union, an arrangement which amounts prac
tically to th? establishment or ono postal sys
tem for the entire civilized world.
There are now connected with the past ofllse
establishment 32.031 employes who are In the
classified service. This includes many who
have becu classified upon the suggestion or
the postmaster-general. Ho states that an
other) car's experience at the head of the de
partment serves only to strengthen the con
viction as to the excellent working of the civil
service law In this branch of the public service.
Our Navy.
Attention is called to the report of the sec
tary or me navy, which shows very gratifying
progress in the construction of ships for our
navy. All the vessels now building." including
the throe torpedo boats authorized at the last
session of congress, and excepting the first
class lKittleship Iowa, will probably be com
pleted duringthe coming fiscal year. The es
timates for the increase of the navv for the
year ending June :t). 1896. are large, but they
include practically the entire sum necessary t
complete and equip all the new ships now in
commission: so that, unlevs new ships arc au
thorized, tha appropriation for the naval serv
ice for the fiscal year ending Juno 3, 1897.
should fall below tho estimates for the coming
year by at least 312.O0J.O33.
Tho secretary presents with much earnest
ness a plea for tho authorization of three ad
ditional battleships and twelve toriKrdo boats.
If we are to hav e a navy for warlike oncrations.
offensive and defensive, we certainly ought to
increase both the number of battleship-, and
torpedo boats.
I feel it my imperative duty to call attention
to the recommendation or the secretary in re
gard to the personnel of the line of the navy.
The stagnation of promotion in this the vital
branch of the service is so great as to seriously
impair its efficiency. I consider it of the ut
most importance that tho young and middle-
aged officers should before the eve of retire
ment be permitted to reach a grade entitling
them to active and important duty. The
system adopted a few years ago regu
lating the employment of labor at the
navy yards is rigldlv upheld and has fully
demonstrated its usefulness and expediency.
It Is within the domain of civil service rcrorm
in as much as workmen are employed through
a board of labor selected at each navy yard,
and are given work without reference topoli
tics and In order of their application, prefer
ences, however, being given to army and navy
veterans and those having former navy yard
experience.
The Interior Dep-trtment.
The report of the secretary or the interior
exhibits the situation of the numerous and in
teresting branches of the public serv ice con
nected with his depirtment I recommend this
report and the valuable recommendations of
the secretary to careful attention of congress.
The public laud disposed of during the
year amounted to 10,4j3,1O3.77 acres.
Including 2JJ37.003 of Indian lands.
It is estimated that the public domain still re
maining amounts to a little more than 003,003.
000 acres, excluding, however, about 350.090.001
acres In Alaska as well as military reservations
and railroad and other selections of lands un
adjndlcatcd. CJThe total cash receipts from sale of lands
amounted to 2.674,2S3.79,includingS91.93103 re
ceived for Indian lands. Thirty-five thousand
patents were issued for agricultural lands and
3.109 patents were Lssued to Indians on allot
ments of their holdings In severalty, the land
so alloted being Inalienable by the Indian al
lottees for a period of twenty-five years after
patent There were certified and patented on
account of railroad and wagon road grants dur
ing me year, S5...-xs.!i acres or land, and at the
close or tho year29.O0O,WX) acres were embraced
in the list or selections made by railroad and
wagon road companies and awaited settlement
The selections of swamp lands and that taken
as Indemnity thereror since the passage of the
act providing for the same in 1319 amount to
nearly or quite 83.500,909 acres.of which 54,093,00 )
have been patented to states, about 138,009 acres
were patented during last year. Nearly 820.000
acres of school and educational grants vrere
approved during the year and at its close 1,-
u-io,-jsi acres remained unadjusted.
An exceedingly Important recommendation
of the secretary relates to the manner in which
contests and litigated cases growing out of ef
forts to obtain government land are de
termined. I concur In the opinion that the
commissioner of the general land office should
be relieved or this duty of deciding litigated
land cases: that a non-partisan court should be
created to pass on such cases and that decis
ions of this court should be final, at least so far
as the decisions of the department are final.
The registers and receivers who originally
hear and decide these disputes should be in
vested with authority to compel witnesses to
attend and testify before them. Though the
condition of the Indians shows a steady and
healthy progress, their situation is, not satis
factory at all points. Some of them to whom
allotments of iinds have been made arc found
to be unable or disciplined to follow agricultu
ral pursuits, or to otherwise beneficially man
age their land.
I am convinced that the proper solution of
the Indian problem 'and the success of everv-
step taken in that direction depends, to a very
large extent, upon the Intelligence and honestv
of the reservation agents and the interest they
have In their work. An unfit agent will make
no effort to advance the Indians on his reserva
tion toward civilization or preparation for al
lotment or lands in severalty, and his oplnioi
as to their condition iu this and other regards
Ls heedless and valueless.
The intelligent Indian school management
of the past year has been followed b7 gratify
ing results. Efforts have been made -to ad
vance the work in a sound and practical man
ner. The appropriation for the current vear
ending June 33, 13?3, applicable to the ordina ry
survivors of all wars. 753.SCS: widows and rela
lives of deceased soldiers. 215.133: armv nurses
in war of the rebellion. 414. Of these pension
ers, 32,039 arc surviving soldiers of Indian and
other wars prior to the late civil war and
the widows aud relatives of such soldiers.
The remainder, numbering 9372503. are re
ceiving pensions oa account of the war of the
rebellion, and of these 49.344 are on the rolls
under the authority or the act of June 27. 1890,
sometimes called the dependent pension law.
The total amount expended for pensions dur
ing the year was $139,8)1,411.03. leaving an un
expected balance from tho sum appropriated
of $15,203,712.65. The sum necessary to meet
pension expenditures for the year ending June
33. 1893. Is estimated at $I40.M.00). The
commissioner of pensions is of the opinion
that the jear 1893 being the thirtieth
after the close or the war of tho rebellion
must, according to sensible human calculation,
see the highest limit of the pension roll, and
that after that year It must begin to decline.
The claims pending in the bureau have de
creased to more than 9.090 during the year. A
large proportion of the new claims tiled are for
increaso of pension b-those now on the rolls.
The number of certificates issued was 80.213.
The names dropped from the rolls for all
causes during tho year numbered 37.931. Among
our pensioners are nine widows and three
daughters of soldiers of the revolution, aud
forty-live survivors of the war of 181 i.
The comolction of the elerenth census Is
now in charge of the commissioner of labor
The total disbursement on account of the work
for the fiscal) ear ended June 30. 1H)I. amount
ed to $10.33.5,676.81. At the close of the year the
number of pcr-ons employed in the census of
fice was 079. At present there are about VM.

horses 2.811 at an average value of
3139 per head. There was a falling oil in Amer
ican wheat exports or I3.509.000 bushels and the
secretary is inclined to believe thut wheat may
not in the future be the staple export cereal
product of our country, but that corn will con
tinue to advance in importance us an export on
account of the now uses to which it is con
stantly being appropriated: Tho exports of
agricultural products from the United States
for tho fiscal year ending June 30. 189 1, amount
ed to 3623.361.013. being 72.28 per cent, of Amer
ican exports of every description, and the
United Kingdom of Great Britain too'c more
than 54 per cent, of all farm products finding
foreign muri.ets.
The amount appropriated for the weather
bureau was J93I.109. Of that sum $133,500. or
14 per cent . has been saved and is returned to
the treasury. The appropriation to the bureau
of animal industry was $8M).O30and the ex
penditures for tho .vear were oniv 3495.429 24.
thus leaving unexpended 3351.570 73. The in

The secretary of agriculture recommends
that tho law providing for the minroscoplcal
inspection of export and interstate meat be so
amended as to compel owners of the meat in
spected to piy the cost or such Inspection and
I call attention to the arguments presented in
his report In support of this recomnvidation.
The live beer cattle exported and t -gcd dur
ing the year numbered 361.535. This is an in
crease of tf).53:t head over the previous vear.
The office of experiment stations, which is a
part of the United States department of agri
culture, has during the past year engaged Itself
almost wholly in preparing for publication
works based upon the reports of ths agricult
ural experiment stations and other Institutions
for agricultural inquiry in the United States
and foreign countries.
The department expended in the fiscal year
1892. 32.35I.809,"J and out of that sum the total
amount expended in scientific research was
43 0 per cent But in the year ended June 30.
1894. out of a total expenditure of Sl.9l5.9sS.2S
the department applied.")! per cent, of that sum
to scientific works and investigation.
It is deemed possible that an agricultural
census may be taken each year through the
agents of the statistical division of the depart
ment Such a course is commended for trial
by tne chier ol that division. The work done
by the department or agriculture is very super
ficially dealt with In this communication and I
commend the report of the secretary and the
very Important interests with which ii deals to
the careful attention of the congress.
Tho Civil Service.
The advantages to the public service of an
adherence to the principles or ch il service re
form are constantly more apparent and noth
ing is so encouraging to those in official life
who honestly desire good governmentas the in
creasing appreciation by our people of theso
advantages, a vast majority ol tho voters of
the land are ready to insist that the time and
the attention of those they select to perform for
them important public duties, should not be
distributed by doling out minor offices and
they arc growing to be unanimous in regarding
party organization as something that should
be used In establishing party principles instead
of dict?.ing the distribution of public places as
rewards of partisan activity. Numerous addi
tional offices and places have lately been
brought within civil service rules and egulo.-
tno iorelgn carrying trade of the sei. The
ancient provision of our law denying American
registry to snips bant abroad and owned bv
Americans appears. In the light of present
conditions, not only to be a fallurcfor good at
every point, but to be nearer a relic of barbar
Lsm than anything that exists under the per
mission or statute of t he United States. I
earnestly recommend Its prompt repeal.
The Bond Issue.
During the !at month thpimlil n-wm-s in
the treasury for the purpose of redeeming the
notes or the government circulating as money
In the hands of the people became so reduced,
and Its further depletion In the near future
seemed so certain, that In the exercise of
proper care for the public welfare it became
necessary to replenish this reserve and thus
maintain popular faith In tho ability and de
termination of the government to meet, as
agreed. Its pecuniary obligations. It would
have been well If In this emergency authority
had existed to Issue the .bonds of the gov
ernment bearing a low rate of interest
and maturing within a special period,
but the congress having failed to comer such
authority resort was necessarily had to the re
sumption act of 1875. and pursuant to its pro
vision, bonds were issued drawing Interest at
tho rate of 5 per cent per annum and maturing
ten years artcr their issuing, th-it being the
shortest time authorized by the act I am glad
to say. however, that on the sale of these bonds
the premium received operated to reduce the
rate of interest to be paid by the government
to less than 3 per cent. Nothing could be worse
or farther removed from sensible finance than
the relations existing between the currency
the government has Issued, the gold heltl
for Its redemption and the means which
must be resorted to for the purpose of replen-
lsningsucu redemption fund when Impaired.
Even if the claims upon this fund were con
fined to the obligations origina'Iy intended,
and If the redemption of th-se obligations
meant their cancellation, the fund would bo
very small. But these obligations when re
ceived and redeemed Id-gold are not cancelled,
but may be reissued and may do duty many
times by way of drawing gold from the treas
ury. Thus we have an endless chiln in opera
tion constantly depleting the treasury's gold
and never near a final rest. As if this was not
bad enough, we have by a statutory declara
tion that it is the policy of the government
to maintain the parity between gold and silver
aided the force and momentum of thisexhaust
ing uroccss and added la-'elv to thn e:irr,nTr
obligations claiming this peculiar cold redemn-
tlon. Our small gold reserve Is thus subject to
draw from every side. The demands that in
crease our danger also increase the necessity of
protecting this reserve arainst dcnietion. and
It Is most unsatisfactory to know that the nro- nrn-r 1
tection afforded is only a temporary palliation. I 0t lle-s
It is ;erfcctly ani palpably plain that ,
ihe only way under present conditions by
which this reserve, when dangerously de
pleted, can be replenished is through
the Issue and sale or "the bonds of tho
government ror gold, and yet congress has not
only thus far declined to authorize the issue of
bonds best suited to such a purjKise. but there

The larger proportion of street rail

The 2evv York & Philadelphia
Traction Co. proposes to construct an
electric road from Now York to Phila
delphia, with lines running down from
Trenton on both sides of the Delaware
through the groups of towns which
dot the banks of that waterway.
Officials in Philadelphia say that
the passenger business, which was di
verted by the trolley lines, is coming
back, and that the receipts are begin
ning to show an improvement. Tha
introduction of trolley lines has. how
ever, checked the construction of short
lines by the steam roads. An illustra
tion of this is found in the prospective
abandonment by the Pennsylvania of a
line from a point on the (lermantovvn
branch to the Trenton cut-off.

Tho Tariff.
The tariff ,ct passed at tho last session or
congress needs Important amendments If it is
executed effectively and with certainty. In
addition to such necessary amendments as will
not change rates of duty. I am still very de
cidedly in favor of putting coal and iron on the
free list So far as the sugar schedule ls con
cerned, I would be glad, under existing aggra
tiotis, to see every particle of differen
tial duty In favor of refined sugar
stricken out ot our tariff law.
I earnestly repeat here the recommendation I
have made in another Dortion of this ntrmmu.
jiication, that the additional duty of om-tenth
ot a cent per pound laid upon sugar imported
irouj iorelgn countries paying a bounty on Its
export be abrogated. It seems to me that ex

Questions, relating- to- our bunk and currency
are closely connected with the subject referred
to: they present some unsatLsfactory features.
Prominent among them are the lack of elasti
city in our currency circulation and its fre
quent concentration in financial centers when
it is most needed In other parts of the country.
The absolute divorcement of the government
from the businesn-or banking is the Ideal rela -tlonshipof
the government to the circulatioa
of the currency of the country- This condition
cannot be Immediately reached but asa step in
that direction and as. a. means, of securing a
more elastic currency and obviating other ob
jections to the present arrangement
of bank circulation the secretary of
tho treasury presents hLs. reported scheme
modifying present banking laws and
providing for the Issue of circulating- notes by
state banks free from, taxation under certain
limitations. The secretary explains hLs plan
so plainly and its advantages are developed by
him with such remarkable clearness that any
effort on my part to present arguments in it
support would be superfluous. I shall therefore
content ravself with, an unqualified indorse
ment ot the secretary' proposed changes in
the law and a brief and imperfect statement of
their prominent features.
It is proposed to repeal all law providing
for the deposit of United State bonds as se
curity for circulation: to permit national
banks to isue ctrculatinsr notes not exceeding
in amount 75 percent ot their paid ui and un
impaired capital, provided they deposit with
the government as a guarantee fund la United

of the total circulation outstanding. When a
bank falls its guarantee fund Ls to be paid
into this safety fund and its notes are to be re
deemed in the first instance from such safety
all tried and found wantinjr. Finally
a novel idea was adopted. The walls
and ceiling of a" roomi were paint
ed white, and under each of a number
of arc lights was suspended a reflector,
which 'threw all tho light up to tho
white ceiling, from which it was re
flected to the room below. This sys
tem was successful from the outset,
and has attracted considerable atten
tion amontr English woavers. It has
been adopted also by a braid mill ia
Pawtucket to light a braiding room
SO feet wide and 200 feet long. The
room is admirably adapted for such a
system of illumination, as there are no
columns in it, and but few belts near
one wall. On entering it, it is said,
there seems to be an absence, of proper
light, but in a few minutes the feeling
of dusk dissppears in the unnsualljr
even, steady illumination
TACITLY UNDERSTOOD.
The Officer Knew That the Cnmblnatloa
Had Failed.
A patrolman on Third street saw a
man the other night fussing away at
the front door of a house in what
seemed to be a suspicious manner, and.
he felt it his duty to approach and de
mand: .
'Say. now, but what are you trying
to do there'.'-'
The man came down to the sidewalk
and took a squint at the ollieer aud re
plied: "Policeman, eh? Sir, you are doubt
less a husband'.'''
"Ye. sir."
"And now and then you leave
your fireside and go out to take a
walk?"'
'Exactly.-'
'And the hours pass so swiftly by
that before you realize it the bells aro
tolling the hour of midnight'.''
"That's the way of it. I've been
caught that way a score of times. It's
funn- how it comes midnight so soon
after ten o'clock."
"Officer." continued the citizen as he
reached out to shake hands, ".ome
wives are kickers."
"Alas, yesl"
'My wife is one. At half-past ten
she locked this door and went up
stairs, saying to herself that I might
roost on the steps or go to a hotel."
"And that's mv wife to a dot
fund thus augmented: any impairment of such
fundi caused thereby to be made good from the
immediately available cash assets of said
bank, and If these should be insufficient such
impairment to be made good by prorata as
sessment among the other banks, their
contributions constituting a first lien
upon the assets of the failed bank in
&Tor of the contributing- banks.
As a further security it Ls contemplated that
the existing proposition fixing the individual
liability of stockholders is to be retained and
the banks indebtedness on account of its circu
lating notes is to be made a first lien on all its
assets. For the purpose of meeting the ex
pense of printing notes, officials supervision,
cancellation, and other like charges, there
shall be imposed a tax of say, 'i of 1 per cent
per annum upon the average amount of notes
in circulation It Ls further provided that
there shall be no national bank notes Issued
of a less denominat ion than ?I0.
That each intlonal bank, except in case of a
failed bank, shall redeem or retire its notes in
the first instance at its own office or at agencies
to be designated by It t'aat no fixed reserve
used be maintained vj account of deposits.
Anothe-verv important feature of this plan Is
the exemption of state banks from taxation by
the Unl'ed States In cases where it Is shown
to the satisfaction of the secretary of the treas
ury and comptroller of the currency by banks
claiming such exemption that they have
not had outstanding their circulating
notes exceeding 75 per cent of
their paid up and unimpaired capital:
that their stockholders are Individually liable
for tho redemption of their circulating notes to
the full extent of the ownership of stock: that
the liability ol such banks upon their circulat
ing notes constitutes under their state law a
first lien upon their assets; that such banks
have kept and maintained a guarantee fund in
United State legal tender notes, including
treasury notes of 1390 equal to 39 per cent of
their outstanding circulating notes and that
such banks have promptly redeemed their cir
culating notes when presented at their princi
pal or branch office.
It is quite likely that this scheme may be
usefully amended in some of its details, but I
am satisfied it furnishes a basis for a very
great Improvement tn our present banking and
currency system.
I conclude this communication, fully appre
ciating that the responsibility for legislation
affecting the people of the United States rests
upon their representatives In the congress and
assuring them that whether accordance with
recommendations I have made or not, I shall
be glad to co-operate in perfecting any legis
lation that tends to tha prosperity and welfare
! sighed the officer.
"I have been home for half an hour
I have tried all the doors and windows.
I have softly called the name of mr
Maria. I have thrown pebbles at her
window." '"And you are still on the outside?"
"I am. and it may be tacitly under
stood between the two of us that I'll
have to remain on the outside until the
hired girl gets up in the morning if
this button hook won't work the lock.
Officer, good night."
"Good night, sir."
"Tacitly understood, and you needttls
worry over burglars and skeleton keys.
I may want you in the morning to
swear that we stood talking on the
corner when the belLs struck 10. but
until then farewell."
An hour latjer the officer returned,
and through the- frosty curtain vailing
the night he made oaf a figure humped
up against the front door. He made
no halt, and uttered no word. He
tacitly understood that the button
hook hadn't worked and the man who
took a walk was still on the outside.

A Spider's Appetite.
Observing the voracity of spiders. Sir
John Lubbock concluded to determine
the quantity of food which one of these
creatures consumed. He caught a
large one. and. weighing it carefully,
supplied it with insects, the weight of
which had been accurately determined.
He carried the experiment through a
considerable period of time, and here
is his summing up of the extraordinary
results: At a similar rate ' of con
sumption, a man weighing one hun
dred and sixty pounds would require a
whole fat steer for breakfast, a steer
and five sheep for dinner, and for sup
per two bullocks, eight sheep and four
hogs. This would hardly suffice for
the twenty-four hours, so just before
retiring, he would call for and con
sume nearly four barrels qf fresh fish
