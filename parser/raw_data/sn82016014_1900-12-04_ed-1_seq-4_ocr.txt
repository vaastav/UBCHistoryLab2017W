If Billionaire Beit shall succeed In
cornering all the gold in, the world, the
world may retaliate by going on a silver
basis.
The man who Is not worth his salt
may still be of considerable value since
the trust has gained control of the
mines.
The continued activity of the Boers
is likely soon to cause General- Buller
to resume his business of crossing and
recrossing rivers.
The recent renewal by a large num
ber of newspapers throughout the eoun
try of attempts to justify the Porto
Rican tariff are equivalent to again
calling attention to an error of the
president. Perhaps in the future Mr.
McKinley will profit by this bit of ex
perience and avoid agreeing with the
Democrats on anything.
There has been a widely expressed de
Fir? among Republican politicians to
find some way by which the congres
sional representation of the south might
be cut down. Mr. Crumpacker, of In
diana, appears to have reached a solu
tion of the probk-m. He has introduced
a reapportionment bill based upon the
census of 1900, which if passed will
cause a net loss to the south of nine
members and a. considerable gain to
other sections of the union. The total
increase of membership would be but
eight. Kansas and Nebraska each
would lose one member. North Caro
lina -would lose four. It is evident that
Mr. Crumpacker has done some careful
figuring.
THE PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE.
President McKinley's annual message
submitted to congress yesterday is
chiefly remarkable for the absence of
any large number of recommendations
along the lines of needed legislation. It
is largely devoted to a review of the
country's relations with the remainder
of the world.
Among the subjects touched upon In
connection with internal matters is that
of lynching, which he says must not be
tolerated in the United States.
Attention is called to the importance
of pushing the construction of the isth
mian canal and the Pacific cable.
A lowering of the taxes to the extent
of 330,000,000 is recommended.
Further legislation for the purpose of
Insuring the continued parity of the
money metals is suggested.
The granting of subsidies to steam
ships la distinctly endorsed in a few
words in which the president declares
tils belief that the country favors the
plan.
He stands firmly for a continuation of
his present policy in the Philippines.
The subject of trusts is touched but
lightly, with no distinct recommenda
tion concerning them.
What will probably appeal to many
as the best part of the message is left!
to the last, and is as follows:
"In our great prosperity -we must
guard against the danger it invites to
extravagance In government expendi
tures and appropriations; and the
chosen representatives of the people will
I doubt not furnish an example in their
legislation of that wise economy which
in a season of plenty husbands for the
future. In this era of great business
activity and opportunity, caution Is not
untimely. It will not abate but
strengthen confidence. It will not re
tard, but promote legitimate industrial
and commercial expansion. Our grow
ing power brings with It temptations
and perils requiring constant vigilance
to avoid. It must not be used to invite
conflicts, nor for oppression, but for the
more effective maintenance of those
principles of equality and justice upon
which our Institutions and happiness
depend. Let us keep always In mind
that the foundation of our government
la liberty; its superstructure peace."
TSADE WITH GERMANY.
A good deal of anxiety seems to have
been wasted w ith reference to the trade
relations between the United States and
Germany. It will be remembered that
a fear was expressed some months ago
that certain trade restrictions proposed
In Oermany might seriously Interrupt
the commercial relations between that
country and the United States, and
especially decrease our exports to that
country In agricultural products. Fig
ures Just issued by the treasury bureau
of statistics show that our exports to
Germany, in the ten months ending with
October, 1900, were J27,0O0,00O greater
than those In the corresponding months
of last year, an increase of about 20
per cent., and that our imports from
Germany show an increase of JS.00O.00O,
a gain of over 10 per cent.
Of the forty great articles which com
pose the bulk of our exports to Ger
many more than two-thirds show an
Increase in 1900 as compared with 1890.
Those which show the principal decrease
are hog products, corn, wheat, fertilizers
and certain lines of machinery. Those
which show an increase are cotton,
flour, fruits, tobacco, timber, mineral
oils, cottonseed oil, oil cake and meal,
tallow, paraffin, rosin, turpentine, coal,
copper, builders' hardware, scientific and
eleetrical instruments, agricultural im
plements, sewing- machines, cars and
furniture.
Copper shows an increase of more
: than JS.000.000. mineral oils . J2,000,000,
tobacco and agricultural implements
nearly $1,000,000 each, and unmanufac
tured cotton over $23,000,000, while in the
list of articles which show a decrease
there are but two cases In whicH the
falling off is ai much as $1,000,000, corn
showing a reduction of a little more
than $1,000,000 and wheat a little more
than $2.000,000.
GLOBE SIGHTS.
From the Atchison Globe.!
It is the easiest thing in the world to
begin things.
Women's imaginary aches and pains
gave Christian science a root-hold.

lords, dukes and counts to know that
she will have none of them. An Ameri

hnd one.
Be thankful that you are not very
wealthy; be thankful that you are not

The women who drink to excess are

doned in the new time card now being
prepared to go into effect December 27.

Indications That a Corner
in
December Is Hatching.
Chicago, Dec. 4. The Evening Post
says:
Indications on the board of trade are
that there is another corner hatching
in corn, this time in the December op
tion. Who the factor in the operations
s la not now known.
Conditions are practically the same
as- they were in November, in regaro.
to the situation, Phillips, who engi
neered the November squeeze, said to
day:
It looks as if the stocks of old corn
would this month be the smallest in
history. Contract stocks of corn are to
day 1,300,000 bushels. Of this I own 900,
000 bushels, 500,000 bushels of which ia
already contracted for. The remaining
400,000 bushels of my line; is all but dis
posed of. The remainder of local con
tract stocks, 400,000 bushels, is held by
shippers, and there is a good demand
for it."
December corn was nervous today. It
opened at 36 cents, advanced to 31
cents, declined to 36 cents, and then
rallied again to 36 cents.
THE CURFEW IN ENGLAND.
CFrom the London Chronicle. 1
The revival a few days ago In Bucking
ham of the ancient custom of ringing the
curfew bell is a reminder that this pic
turesque relic of Norman England still
survives In more than thirty towns ar.d
cities throughout the country. At some
of these the bell ia rung at certain stated
periods only. Thus at Pershore, in Wor
cestershire the curfew Is only heard be
tween November 5 and Candlemas, and
at Brackley church from Michaelmas to
Lady day only: while Its original signifi
cance if. of course, entirely a thing of the
past. "The knell of parting day'' is or
was until recently still tolled from Can
terbury cathedral, and from the Church
of St. Nicholas, Bristol, every evening. Ey
a code of instructions dated 1481 the suf
fragan of the Bristol diocese was directed
"to ring curfew with one bell at IX of the
clock."

MAKE SOME ONE HAPPY.
Mrs. Thorpe's Touching Letter to the
Children of Topeka.
For several years Mrs.'Tborpe has col
lected Christmas Dresents for the poor
children in the city and has seen tnat
they got something on that day which
would make them happy. The custom
of giving the poor children presents on
Christmas day is a Very good one and
will be followed again this year provid
ing the children who have something to
give will help Mrs. Thorpe in the work.
Last year the children responded no
bly to the call and they are to have an
opportunity to do so again tnis year.
There is plenty of time before Christmas
to think of what can be done.
Mrs. Thorpe has addressed the follow
ing letter to the children on the subject:
To the Children of Topeka.
Dear Little Friends: When I asked
you last year to remember the poor
children who can have no Christmas
presents, you answered from all parts of
the city with your little gifts and nice
letters, so I will write you again this
year to help me.
Santa Claus does not get around to
the poor children because he wants to
give you the pleasure of being a Santa
Claus to them. I think. And then tit
knows, too, that the books and toys of
which you have grown tired would
make them very, very rich. I have seen
little children who were barefooted and
who had only bread and tea to eat al
most every meal, and whose bare, cold
arms showed through ragged sleeves.
made so happy by one little toy they
forgot all about being cold and hungry.
So if you feel like being a Santa Claus
to some child please send a little gift
for them before Christmas.
I know over 400 little children who are
too poor to have any Christfas presents
at home. Your friend,
MRS. THORPE.

The lawyers of Topeka are signing a
petition to be presented to the board of

to stay and the commissioners will make
no mistake by giving the spacious court
room to tne city court.

PETITION fiVKINLEY.
W. C. T. U. Ask For Prohibi
tion In the Philippines.
Washington, Dec. 4. The Woman's
Christian Temperance union convention
in session here today adopted resolu
tions against the army canteen and pre
pared a petition to the president, an
other to congress, and identical petitions
to all of the great powers, against the
sale of firearms and the importation of
liquor and opium Into the Philippine Isl
ands or the island possessions of the
other powers addressed.
The petition to the president pointed
out that it has been the policy of Amer
ica to forbid the sale of intoxicants to
the Indian tribes, and that England,
who hadi the greatest experience among
all of the colonizing powers of the
world, had been forced to adopt a pro
hibition policy in her colonies ir. Africa
and elsewhere. ' The convention there
fore asks that, the president, either
through the war department or the
Philippine commission, shall extend the
prohibition law of the Indian Territory
so as to take In the Philippine islands.

ratification of the pending treaty tor
the protection of central Africa against
intoxicants.

all islands and other regions inhabited
chiefly by aboriginal tribes.
A CHAMPION OF THE WORM.
From the Youth's Companion.
The recent session of the British par
liament furnished an amusing illustra
tion of the occasional power of satire to
bring about results which sober argu
ment has failed to accomplish.
A bill designed to prevent cruelty to
wild animals in acptivity had been pre
sented, and was opposed by a number of
members on the ground that if passed it
would endanger certain kinds of legiti
mate sport.
The Earl of Kimberley arose ana
gravely admitted the force of this ar-
gument.
UnaouDteoiy, e saia, tne oui wou'u

vent cruelty to wild animals in captiv
ity: the schedule says the word 'animal'
shall be held to Include reptile; a worm
may be held to be a reptile; a worm im
paled on a hook must certainly be held
to be in captivity; therefore the angler
who uses a live worm for bait would be
guilty of cruelty to an animal In captiv
ity." The laugh which this argument raised
st the expense of the solicitous spurts-
i men robbed the opposition of whatever
force it had, and carriad the bill to a
successful isaua.
