It provided for the organization of n section In
the Department of Agriculture to bo known
ns the "food section of the chemical

the adulterating and misbrundlng of fond ,

Senator Paddock said ; "I hnvo the very
strongest of hopes that this measure will
pass the senate early In the session , but I
want the coniiul and earnest support of my
people in forwarding u bill which In my judg
ment will bo worth millions of dollars aucu-
nlly to the people of the west and the oast. I
think It moots all the requirements of pro
ducer and consumer , us U Is In the interest
both of the stomach and ttio pockotbook. I
don't propose to make myself a bore , but I
do intend to push that pure food for all that
is in it , and In doing so I shall Imvo the cor
dial co-operation of Secretary Kusk and the
Agricultural donnrtmont. "

Opinions on tlio
Senators Paddock and Mandorson
both profess great satisfaction with
the president's message. Senator Pad
dock said : "It is a very able presenta
tion of extraordinary work und conscientious
administration of the people's interest. The
-president , with his roinarkablo ability for
presenting facts , has given us n message
stripped of the usual verbiage and which
will bo u chart by which congress should
steer a straight course for Uio best interests
of these that they represent. Its treatment
of foreign questions will bring a thrill of sat
isfaction to every American citizen who be
lieves in upholding American cltiionship and
Americn honor , und while there may bo dif-
feirnce of opinion as to some of the domestic
questions treated , there can bo none or the
ability with which the administration's
views nro presented and of the integrity of
purpose nnd conviction of duty which Uo bo-
bind tno presentation. "
Senator Maudersoii said : "Tho mossngo
is n very statesmanlike pnpcr , giving to con-
press Just the information which Is of vuluo
for its deliberations. Like nil productions
emanating fiom President Harrison , It shows
the scholarly 'iblllty nnd clour grasp of pub
lic questions , a felicity of expression romurk-
ublo in documents of this character. More ,
than that , it is the work of n trained nnd
business lawyer , who goes directly to bis
poi..t and makes his argument so clear that
no ono can full to grasp his moaning. "
Senator MensurtH.
SonntorMundorson presented a heavy grist
of bills ; besides these heretofore mentioned
In Tin : Iir. : specials , including the battalion
und postal suvlngs banks bills , were the following -
lowing : Establishing a branch , mint of the

There Is not n word of truth In the state

RUMORS ABOUT HOUSE COMMITTEES.
Speaker Crisp Has Not Mmlc Up His
Mind In llccitrd to the Cliulr-
mninhlps Work In the
Senate.
WASHINGTON , D. C. , Dec. 10. The speaker
this afternoon hail not yet decided upon tilt
colleagues on the rules committee , and the
probabilities nro that no conclusion will bo
reached until the house reconvenes Satur
day , and perhaps not until next week. The
speaker has given some consideration to sug
gestions which members Imvo offered htm In
fuvor of a recurrence to the former policy
of choosing the members of the committee ,
the mnjoiily of whom should bo In close personal -
sonal and political relations with the speaker.
Tno mutter has not yet gouo beyond the
stupe of Informal discussion.
Mr. Carlisle , when ho became speaker ,
departed from the prior custom of selecting
members of the committee on rules regard
less of their committee assignments , and
made its membership go as a matter of
course to the chairmen of the two mos' . 1m-
portunt committees namely , ways and moans
nnd appropriations. Sneaker Uccu followed
the sumo course. The previous speakers ,
Messrs. Randall and ICoifcr , had selected tlio
rules committee with regard to other con
siderations. A number of democratic con-
pressmen urge u return to this policy , ai.d
represent that its effect would bo to
strengthen the spcalter , The ways and
means and appropriations committees now
hnvo prior rights under the rules over other
committees , and with their respective chair
men on the rules committee , which is thn
guiding or steering body of The house , the
result is rep resented to bo disastrous to
other committees whoso business may bo
Important. .
There arc two sides to the proposed
methods of constructldg the rules cotnmltteo ,
and the speaker also heard the objections
that were urged against the plan. It was
icproscntod that the work of the npproprla-
tio'ns and the ways and moans committees
'
would be the most 'important of the whole
session ana that these two committees should
have representation on tbo rules committee
for the reason that , otnorwiso , their policy
might bo blocked by the introduction of spe
cial orders having precedence.
Mr. Crisp listened throughout the day to
arguments on this ar.d other manors relating
to the policy of the party In the house In this
congress. Subsequently ho saw nothing had
been dctlnltolv decided upon as to the com
mittees , and ho was unable to say whotuor or
not he would Do able to announce them before
the holidays.
Mr. Springer of Illinois , who Is littoly to
bo chairman of the ways and means com
mittee , If Mr. Mills shojkl bo offered
ana decline the honor , suld today that his
policy with reference to the tariff was to
provide for free wool , free salt , free lumber ,
frco cotton ties , free coal and free binding
twino. Ho said : "J. don't ' think wo should
attempt n general revision of the tariff at
this timo. Wo should offer the country
relief by passing bills for putting tno
articles named on the free list , nnd sending
thorn to the sonata. A general tariff bill
cannot bo enacted into a law. This would
keep congress here until October. I think
there should _ oo appointed a
strong comraltteo "on manufacturers ,
with able investigators on it. It should
consist of fifteen members , ton democrats
nnd flvo republicans. This would make five
sun-committees of three each. They should
divide the work , ono investigating the tex
tile industries , another iron production ,
another glassware and pottery , and so on.
This committee would bt > a sort of adjunct to
the ways and moans committee which could
go on with its work and then subsequently
got all the testimony without a long list of
hnarinps. These sub-committees could no
on duiing the session and also during the
recess. Their inquiries should not bo con
ducted with a spirit of hostility toward the
manufacturers , but with a viuw to ascertain
the bottom facts and ascertain in each case
what , if any , degree of protection is needed ,
as I Have a suspicion that frequently
It Is represented that they need a great deal
mora protection than is really the caso. It
should bo ascertained what Is the labor cost
on things produced ; the wages paid ; whether
tno work bo steady or not ; the profits of
actual capital , and not on watered stock ; the
relative cost of production here and abroad ;
whether there nro agreements to limit uro-
iluctlon , and much more information of a
practical character. This Information is not
now to bo had. Tno party could then fight
the McKinley bill , and if wo win in the elec
tions this Information would onahlo us to
form a tariff Bill adapted to the country's
need and ono that could become a law and
wo would pass it in the Fifty-third congress.
If wo fall in the elections then the informa
tion has boon obtained and wo can keep on
until thn country is educated against the Mo-
Kluloy bill. " _

WASIIINOTOX , D. C. , Dec. 10. Ono of the
llrst subjects to occupy the attention of the
fo'rolgn affairs committee , after the organ
ization of the committees of the house by
Speaker Ciisp , will bo the harsh treatment
of Hebrews by Russia. This question will
ho earnestly pressed upon the attention of
the committee , and It will bo urged to go as
far as possible in expressing Its sympathy
with the Uusslnn Hebrews in their distress ,
and to take Mich measures consonant with
the usages of diplomacy ns will tend to * o-
cure an amelioration of their condition. This
government will ho us Hod to continue the use
of Its good oftlcos as an Intercessory with tbo
c/nr on behalf of the Hebrews.
The president In his mossngo devoted some
space to the question of the u holesalo banish
ment of Jews from Russia and to the en
deavors which this government had thus far
put forth In their behalf. Tbo subject will
bo brought to the attention of the committee
probably by tbo introduction of a formal
resolution , but the customary distribution of
the vauous portions of the president's mes
sage will bring the matter before the com
mittee | n tno absence of any resolution
whatever ,

the 10th of this month on board the
Champalgno as the representative of the
government to study the labor question
In the United States. Wo are anxious
to study the question principally from the
point of view of the relations between work
man and master , arbitration and the limita
tion of hours. Wo propose to take up the
qupstlon In Its broadest view , with all the in
cidents surrounding it. The social question
Is of vast interest here. What wo see Is the
enormous dcccntrnll/ition of the United
States , forming n striking comparison with
our system of contrali/atiou , which appears
to us unlquo. In my visit to the United
States I propose seeing Mr. Powdorly

nskcd the correspondent.
"On account principally of the largo num
ber of strikes which have lately occurred
hero , " replied M. Dcrchavcl , "Tho great
question of the moment , which occupies the
government , is tbo future of the workingman -
man , and the result of the development of the

"No , there are not nny agents np-

Von Cnprlvl Opens tlio Dolt.ito on tlio
Commercial TrcntlcH.
Bmu.iN" , Doo. 10. In the reichstag today
Chancellor von Caprlvl opanoil the debate on
the now commercial treaties , lie made a
strong appeal in favor ot their adoption. Ho
dwelt upon the fact that homo Industries had
received a great impetus under the last cus
tom regimes , so muuh so that ever production
had caused some embarrassment. Thn
present inTport nnd export regulations , ho de
clared , would ruin both the employers and
the employes. The commercial measures
under discussion , therefore , were necessary
to preserve Germany's husbandrv nnd com
merce. This , the chancellor said , was the
principle which had guldod the government
in negotiating the treaties.
Continuing , the chancellor snld that the
immediateuffoctof the tioatles upon the
finances of the empire would bo n diminution la
revenue amounting to nearly 18,000,000 marks.
This was u matter that required budget con
sideration. In regard to the question of the
differential treatment of countries not in
cluded It ) the treaties , these couutrloi hav
ing the most favored nation treatment would
loccivo tbo bonellt of the treaties. RegardIng -
Ing other countries negotiations were about
to open where Germany would endeavor to
obtain concessions. It was needless to speak
of liusslr. . The lamentable distress that
prevailed In that country , causing n stop
page of exports , would not bo icmovod
for some time , and It was useless to discuss
what would bo done afterward. As regards
the United States , the two government ! ) mid
decided to continue to take their Maml on the
basis of the arrangements df IbSo , where by
the United States received the most favored
nation treatment. In any case the govern
ment bad no Intention to inako a further re
duction of tariffs.
Referring to the treaties with Belgium and
Kwitzoiland , the chancellor said : "Lest at
any time we are umiblo to preserve peace , It
mint bo our desire to possess as many faith
ful allies as possible. These wo will bo able
to gain by smoothing the path of politico-
commercial relations. Since the end of the
last century It has boon Impossible to con
clude cabinet convontlomi between govern
ment and government. The heart of the
people must also approve. "
Adverting to tbo McKinlny law , the chan-
collorsuld : "Wo wish the countries of Uu-
rope to preserve their Independence against
America. For this purpose they must unite
toi'othor. The treaties Just concluded will
give a sure guarantee of the future. "
In conclublon ho said ; ' ! bug you to ro-
gqrd the treaties as a whole , with a patriotic
consideration for the interests of the father
land. "
Herr Boicheniporgor , centrist , said ho
hoped that the treaties would bo uurood to
with as great unanimity in possible. Herr
von Knultz. conservative , opposed the chan
cellor's policy.
The debate was then adjournnd.

In regard to the court of claims the nttor *
general says that , ns its business has In.

that the working capacity of the conn ho

that some provision bo made for n represen

gi ognto over $ .20,000,000.
On the subject of United States prisons ,
the attorney general pays : "In pursuance of

From Information * In rognrd to the adminis
tration of the laws of Alaska , the attorney
general is impressed that such administra
tion is not satisfactory , and that It can only
bo mndo satisfactory by now legislation.
The attorney general ugnln calls attnntlon
to the evils of the "fee svstom , " nnd advises
the substitution of stipulated saluilcs lu nil
cases.
, The attorney ccnoral reviews the legal
proceedings in the case against the Chilian
stpumor Until and sums upas follows : "Upon
the dial of this indictment It was hold by
the distilet court that those proceedings
were not in violation of the neutrality laws
of the United States , because the enterprise
was a legitimate commercial transaction and
bccauto of the congressional party ol Chill
not having nt the time received recognition
from the government of the United States ,
eltner as a government do Jure or ns belliger
ents , the acts done by representatives of nnd
In the interests of that party , in the way of
hostilities against the Chilian government ,
were not in violation of any statute of the
Uultod States. "
Hulls iiliiHt Telegraph Companies.
Ho reports flvo suits commenced under the
act of August 7. 1SSS. rcqulrlnc all telegraph
lines subsldi7ed by the government to maintain -
tain and operate for railroad , government ,
commercial and all ether purposes such tele
graph Mho ? , and requiring the attorney
general , bp proper proceedings , to prevent
nny unlawful Interference with tbo rights
and equities nf the United States in its rela
tion to such telegraph linos. On the subject
of those suits the attorney general says :
"In tno suits against the Cen
tral Pacific rnllrjad , Southern Pacific
nnd Western Union Telegraph company ,
pending in the northern district of Califor
nia on demurrers and motions to dismiss for
want of Jurisdiction , ills being claimed on behalf -
half of The Wootorn Union and other corpo
rations ncccssnuly parti'js defendant , having
charters from other states than California ,
thutthoy cannot bo sued In the United States
courts in anv other district than that from
which they derive their respective charters.
In other words , they are not 'inhabitants' of
any district except n district in tbo state
by which they were created. The result
of such contention U that corporations llko
the Western Union Telegraph company , aNew
Now York corporation , doing business in
every state und district in the union , whtoh
has right to sue in federal courts ot tlui vari
ous districts , cannot bo sued in the federal
courts in anv state outside of Now York. " It
Is not believed that such Is the law , at least
where the government Is the plaintiff. Tbo
attorney conarnl recommends an amendment
to the judiciary law of 1838 to correct this.
