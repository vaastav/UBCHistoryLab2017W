BAKER A LONG , Editors.
THURSDAY DECEMBIB 8, 1864.
Wp publish this morning a foil and, we
believe, accurate report of the President's
Message ~feld~t? Congress on last Tuesday.
Having, as stated yesterday morning, de
clined receiving the message by telegraph,
we obtained a copy of one of the Pittsburg
papers at half-past seven o'clock yesterday
morning, and, before ten o'clock, bad pot
the message in type and issued it in the
form of an ' Extra." Our neighbors of the
lnUUigtHcer were more tban two hours be
hind time, notwithstanding their frequent
boasts of "enterprise and activity.'* They
had made extra preparations for the speedy
printing of the message, and had telegraph
ed to Pittsburg for an early copy of the
CommtreiaL, which was obtained, but still
they were fully two hours behind when
the message was printed in the RaoisTxa
office. It was tbeir intention, we learn, to
issue an extra, but, being unable to com*
pete with the RcorsTsa. their enterprise
was "nipped in the bud." We presume our
contemporary will publish the message for
the first time this morning, if they have
yet been able to put it in type. The In
Uiligencer must abate some of its supercili
ous boasting, and withdraw its pretensions
to superior enterprise and skill, or else do
tomcthing to sustain them. Our thanks are
due to the compositors in this office for the
prompt snd satisfactory manner in which
tbey did tbeir Work.
Concerning the message itaelf, we have
no room now for commenta. We will dis
cuss it at another time. From the hasty
reading we hsve given it, we incline to
think tbat it will prove a bitter disappoint
meot to th?>se who have been hoping to find
in it some practicable plan for the solutiou
of our national troubles, and the termination
of the war.
PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE
Fellow citizens of the Senile,
and House of Representation
Again the blessings of health and abun
dant harvests claim our profoundest grati
tuie to Almighty God. The condition of
our fofeign affairs "is reasonably satisfactory.
Mexico continues to be the theatre of
civil war. While our political relation#
with that country have undergone do
change, we have at the same time strictly
maintained neutrality between the bellige
rents. At the request of the Stata of Cos
ta Rica and Nicaragua a competent engin*
eer has been authorized to make a survey
of the river San J uan, and the port of San
J uan. It is a source of much satisfaction
that the difficult'eir which, for a moment,
excited some political apprehensions, and
caused a closing of the inter oceaoic trsn
sit route have been amicabiy adjusted, and
that there is a good prospect that the route
will soon be reopened with an increase of
capability and adaptation. We would not
exaggerate eituar the commercial or tfce
political importance of that groat- improve
meat.
It would be do;cg injustice to an import*)
ant South American State not to acknowl
edge tha directness, frankness and cordial i
tv with which the United States of Colum*
bia have entered iuto intimate lelations with
this government. A claim convention has
been constituted to cociplct ? the unfinished
work ot the one which closed its sessions
in 1861. The new liberal constitution of
Venezuela having gone into effect with
the uuiversal acqaieeeoce of the people, the
government under it has been recognized
and diplomatic intercourse with it has been
opened in a cordial and friendly spirit. The
long deterred Avis Inland claim has been
satisfactorily paid and discharged. Mutual
payments have been made of the claims
awarded by t be Joint Commission for :he
settlement of claims between the United
States and Peru. An earnest and cordial
friendship contiuues to ex'st between the
two countries and such efforts a9 were in
my power have been used to remove mis
understanding, and avert a threatened war
between Peru aud Spain. Our relations are
of the most friendly nature, with Chili, the
Argentine Republic, Bolivsr, Costa Rica,
Paragua, San Salvador and Hay ti. During
the past year no differences of any kind
nave arUen with any of these republic-*,
and on the other hand their sympathies
with the United States are constantly ex
pressed.
The claim arising from the seizure of the
cargo of the brig Macedonian, in 1861, has
been paid in full by the Government of
Chili. Civil war continues in the Spanish
coast of San Domingo, apparently without
prospect of an early c'ose.
Official correspondence has been opened
with Liberia, and it give* us a pleasing
view of social and political progress in that
Republic. It is expected to derive new
vigor from American influence, improved
by the rapid disappearance of slavery in the
United States.
1 solicit your authority to furnish the
Republic a gunboat at a moderate cost, to
be reimbursed to the United States by in
bailments, Such a vessel Is needed for
the safety of that State against the Afri
can rsge, and in Liberian hands, it would
be more effective in arresting the African
Slave Trade than a squadron in our own
hands. The possession of the least organ
ized naval force should stimulate a gene*
rous ambition on the part of t'ie Republic,
?nd the confibence which we should mani
test by furnishing it would win forbearance
and favor towards the colonies from all the
civibzed nations.
The proposed overland telegraph between
America and Europe, by way of Behrlng
Straits, and Asiatic Russia, which was sane
tioued by Congress at the last session, has
been undertaken under very favorable cir
cumstancee, by an association of American
oitiz :nv with the cordial good will and sup>
p -rt ol this G vernment, as well as those of
Great Britain and Russia. Assurances
have been received from most of the Amer
ican States, of their high appreciation of
the enterprise, and their' readiness to co-op
?rate in constructing lines tributary to that
world encircling communication, I learn
with much satisfaction that the noble de
sign of a telegraphic communication be?
tire* the Eastern coast of Amerioa and
Great Britain has been renewed with fnll
expectation of its early aooompliskaaat?
Thus it if hoped that, with the return ol do
mestic peace, the oountry will be nble to
resume, with energy and advantage, their
former high career of commerce and drxli
eation. Our very popular and esti
mable repreeentatiTe in ?gypt died in
April last. An unpleasant altercation
wbich arose between the temporary locum
bent of the office and the Government of
the Pasha, resulted in a suspension of intern
coarse
The error was promptly corrected on the
arrival of the successor in the Consulate,
and our relations with Egypt at well as the
relations with the Barbary power* are en
tirely satisfactory. The rebellion wbich
has so loog been flagrant in China has at
last been suppressed with the co-operating
good offices of this Government and of the
other comaiercisl Ststss.
The Judicial Consular establishment has
become very difficult and onerous, and it
will need Legislation to adapt it to the ez
tension of our commerce and to the more
intimate intercourse which has been insti*
tuted with the government and people of
that vast empire. China seems to be ac
cepting, with hearty good will, the eon
ventional laws which regulate commercial
snd social intercourse among the western
nations. Owing to the peculiar situation of
Japan, and the anomalous form of this go
vernment, the action of that Empire in
performing treaty stipulations is inoonsis*
tent snd capricious. Nevertheless good
progress has been effseted by the Western
peirers, moving with enlightened concert,
our own peculiar claims have been allowed
or put in course of ssttlement, and the in
land set has been reopened to commerce.
There is resson, also, to believe that these '
proceedings have increased rather than di*
m (Dished the friendship of Japan towards
the United States.
Ths ports of Norfolk, Fernandina and
Pensacola have been opened by 'proclama
tion. It Is hoped that foreign merchants
will now consider whether it is not safer
aod more profitable to themeelvas, as well
as more just to the United States to re
sort to these, and other open ports, than it
is to pursue through msny htiards and at
a vast cost, a contraband trade with other
ports which are closed, if not by actual mil
itary operation, at least by a lawful and ef
fcciual blockade. For myself, I have no
doubt of the power aod duty of the Ex
ecutive under the law of natioos to exclude
the enemies of the human race an asylum
in the United States.
If Congress should think that proceed*
ings In such cases lack the authority of
law, or ought to be further repudiated by
it, 1 recommend that provision be made for
effectually preventing foreign slave traders
from acquiring Gomieil and facilities for
their criminal occupation in our country.
It is possible if it were a new and open
question, the maritime powers with the
light they now enjoy, would not ooooede
the privileges of a naval belligerent to the
insurgents of the United States, destitute
as they are and always have been, equally
of ships and of ports or harbors. Disloyal
smissaries have been neither less assiduous,
nor more successful during the last year
than they were before that time in their ef
forts under favor of that privilege to em
broil our oountry in foreign wars. The de
sire and determination of the maritime
States to defeat that deaign are believed to
be as sincere and cannot be more earnest
thsn Europe. Nevertheless unforeseen difs
Acuities have arisen, especially in Brasilian
and British ports, and on the northern
boundsry of the United States, which have
required and are likely to oontinue to re
quire the prsctice of oonstmt vigilance and
a just snd conciliatory spirit on the psrt of
the United States as well as of the natioos
concerned and thsir governments. Com
missioners have been appointed under the
treaty with Great Britain on the adjust
ment cf the claims of the KJudson Bay and
Puget's Sound Agricultural Compsnies, in
Oregon, and are now proceeding to the ex
ecution of the trust sssigned to them.
In view of the insecurity of life In the
region adjacent to the Canadian border, by
recent asaauits and depredation committed
by inimical and desperate persons who are
harbored there, it has been thought pro
per to give notice that after the expiration
of six months, the period conditionally stip
ulsted iu the existing arrangements with
Great Britain, the United States must hold
themselves at liberty to incresse their naval
armament upon the lakes if they shall find
that proceeding necessary.
The condition of the border will necessa<
rilly come into consideration in connection
with the question of continuing or modify
ing the rights of transit from Canada
through the United States, as well as the
regulation of imports which were tempor
arily established by the reciprocity treaty
of t he fifth of J une, 1854. I desire, how
ever, to be understood while mskiog this
statement, that the colonial authorities are
not deemed to be intentionally unjust or
unfriendly towsrds the United States, but
on ths contrary, there is every reason to
expect that with the approval of ths Imper
ial Government thoy will tske the necessary
measures to prevent new incursions across
the border. The act passed at the last
sessiou for the encouragement of immi
gration has, as far as was possible, been put
into operation. It seems to need amend
ment which will enable the officers of the
government to prevent the practice of
frauds sgainst the immigrants while on
their way and oo their arrival in the ports,
and so as to secure them here a free choice
of avocations and places of settlement.
A liberal disposition towards this great
national policy, is manifested by moot of
the European Statee, and ought to be re
0 procated on our part by giving the immi
grant effective national protection. I re
gard our immigrants as one of the princi
ple replenishing streams which are ap
pointed bj Providence to repair the ravages
01 internal war and its wastes ef national
strength aod health. All that is necessary
is to secure the flow of tbst stream in it
present fullness, and to that end the gov
ernment must in every way make it man
ifest that it neither needs nor designs to
impose involuntary military service qpon
those who oome from other lands to east
their lot in our country.
The financial affairs of the Government
have been successfully administered. Dur
ing the last year the legislation of the last
session of Congress ha* beneficially effected
?he revenue, although sufficient time hss
not yet elapsed to experience the full elect
of several of the provisions of the acts of
Congress imposing increased tavation. The
reoeipts during toe year from all sourcee
upon the basis of warrants signed by the
Secretary of the Treasury, including loans,
and the balance in the Treasury on the first
day of July, I BW,' were #1,394.706,007 62,
and the aggregate disbursements upon the
fame basis, wfflMfl.298,056,101 89, leaving
a balaaoa ia Treasury as shown by
warrants,{of $99,799,905 73. Deduct from
th>M amounts the amount of the principal
of tbap&lio debt redeemed and the amount
of iaeaea in substitution therefor, and the
actual oath operations of the Treasury were:
receipts, $884,066,646 77 : disbursements,
$866, 114,067 86; which bales a cash bal,
aooa in the treasury of $llfly84$,56$ 71. ! Of
the receipt* there were derived frotu cus
to?ML $108,316,162 99; from lands, $588 -
333,28; from direct taxes, $475,643 96; from
internal revenue, $109,741,134 10; fromr
miscellaneous sources, $47,511,443 81; and
from loans applied to act oaf eipfciimtures,
including former balance, $623,443,929 23
There were disbursed for the ciifil ser
vice, $27,605,599 46 ; for pensions and In
dians, $7,517,930 97. for the War Depart,
ment, $60,891,842 97; for tbe Navy Depart
ment, $85,733,292 79; for interest of public
debt, $53,685,421 79, making an aggregafei
of $865,234,087 86, and leaving a balance
in the Treasury of $18,842,558 71, as be
fore stated. For the actual receipts sod
disbursements for the first quarter, and the
estimated receipts and disbursements for
the ' three remaining quarters of tbe cur*
rent fiscal year and the federal operations
of the Treasury in detail, I refer you to
the report of the Secretary of the Treasury.
I concur with him in tbe opinion that the
proportion of the monies required to meet
the expenees consequent upon the war, de
rived from taxation, should be etill further
increaaed, and I earnestly invite your at*
tention to this subject to the end, that there
may be snch additional legislation as shall
be required to meet the just expectations of
the Secretary. The public debt on the
first day of J uly last, as appears by the
books of the Tressu/y, amounted to one
billion, seven hundred and forty million,
six hundred and . ninety thousand four
hundred and eighty?nine dollars and
forty-nine cents.
| Probably, should the wsr continue for
another year, that amount may be increase
cd by not far from five hundred millions. ?
Held ae it is for the ino3t part by our own
people it has become ? substantial branch
of national though private property. For
obrious reasons, the more easily this prop*
erty can be distributed among all the peo
ple the better; to fsvor such general distri
I button, greater inducements to become ?wn?
I ere might perhaps with good effect, and
without iojury, be preeeoted to persons
with limited means- With tjijs view, I
I suggest w j ether it might not be both ex
pedient and competent for Congress to pro
I vide that a limited amount of some future
issue of public secuiities might be held by
any bona fide purchaser, exempt from taxa
tion and from seizure for debt, under auch
restrictions and limitations as might be
necessary to guard against abuse of so im
portant a privilege. Tbis would eo&blo
prudent persons to set aaide a small annul
ty against a possible day of want.
Privileges like these woulcl render the
I possession of such securities to the a*>> >unt
I limited, most desirable to every pcr>u.? of
small means who might bo able t<? save
enough for the purpose. The great udvan*
tare of citisens being creditors as well as
debtor* with relation to the public debt
is obvious. Men readily perceive that they
cannot be much oppressed by a debt Which
they owe to themselves. The public debt
on the first day of Jaly last, although
somewhat exceeding tbe estimate of the
J Secretary of tbe Treasury, made to Con
S:ss at the commencement of last session
Is short of the estimate of that officer,
J made in the preceding December, as to its
probable amount at the beginning of this
year by the sum of $3,995,079,33. Tbis
fact exhibits a satisfactory condition and
conduct of the operations of tbe Treasury.
The National Banking system is proving
to be acceptable to capitalists and to tbe
people. On the 15th of November 684
Natiooal Banks bad boen organized, a con
siderable number of which were conver
sions from State Banks. Changes from
I the State system to tbeNstional system are
I rapidly taking place , and it is boped that
1 very soon there will be in tbe United States
no bank of issue not aatborited by Cont
gress, and no bank note circulation Dot
received by the Government. That the
Government and tbe people will derive
general benefit from this change in the
banking systems of the country, can hardly
be questioned. The national system will
create a reliable and permanent influenco
in support of the national credit and pro
tect the people against losses in the use of
paper money. Whether or not any further
legislation is admissible for tbe suppression
of State bank issues, will be for Congress
to determine.
It seems quite clear that the treasury
cannot be satisfactorily conducted unless
the government can oxercise a restraining
power over the bank ncte circulation of tbe
country. The report of the Secretary ol
War acd the accompanying documents will
detail the campaigns of the armies iu the
field since the date of the last annual mes
sage, and also tbe operations of the several
Administrative Bureaus of the War De
partment during the last year. It will also
specify the measure* deemed essestial for
the national defense, and to keep up and
supply the requisite military force.
The report of the Secretary of the Navy
present* a comprehensive and satisfsctory
exhibit of the affairs of that Department,
and of the naval service. It is a subject of
congratulation and laudable pride to our
couotrymtn, that a navy of suoh vast pro
portions has been organised in se brief a
period and conducted with so much efficien
cy and success. The general exhibit of tbe
navy, including vessels under construction
on the 1st of December, 1864, show* a
of ^J1 ??"ls carrying 4,610 guns
and 510,190 tons, being an actual increase
during the year, over and above all loesm
by shipwreck or in battle of, 83 Vessels, 167
guns and {2,427 tons.
The tqtal number of tpen at this time in
the naval service, including officers, isabout
61,000. There have been ' captured by the
navy, during the year, 321 vessels, and the
whole number of naval captures since he s
till ties commenced is one thousand three
hundred, of which 967 are steamers. The
gross prooeed* arising from the sale of con
demned prite property thus far reported
amount to $14 395,250 61. Alargi amount
of snch proceeds is ?till qader adjudication,
and yet to be reported.
Tbe tetal expenditure of the Navy De -

the ooet of tbe immense squadrons thst

Your attention is invited to the report
f){ Postaasster General for a deUiled
account of the operations and financial
eoodTttea oF tfce Posfoffice Department
The Postal Revsjraea for tho year end
ing June 30th, 1864, amounted to 81,243,
825 378, and the expenditures to $1,264,
477,620. The excess of expenditures over
receipt* being $'20,665,242. ? f
The views presented by the Postmaster
General on tbe subject of special grants
by tbe Government in aid of the ettab
lishment of ocean mail steamships, and tbe
policy he recommends for the develope
Cent of increased commercial intercourse
ith rdjacent and neighboring countries
should receive the careful consideration of
Congress. . It is of noteworthy interest
that the steady expansion of population
improvement and governmental institu
tions over the new and unoccupied portions
of our country have scarcely been checked,
much less impeded or destroyed, by our
great civil war, which, at first glance,
would seem to have absorbed almost the
entire energies of the nation. The organ!
station and admission of tbe State of Neva
da has been completed in conformity with
law, and thus our excellent system in tbe
mountains, which once seemed a barren
and inhospitable waste between tbe At
lantic States and those which have grown
up on the coast of the Pacific Ocein.
Tbe territories of tbe United States are
generally in a condition of prosperity and
rapid growth. Idaho and Montana, by rea^
son of their great distance and tho inter
ruption of communication with tbem by In
dian hostilities, have been only partially or
ganized, but it ia understood that these dif
ficulties are about to disappear, which will
permit their governments, like thone of
others, to go into speedy and full operation.
As intimately connected with and promo*
tife of tbe material growth of tbe nation, I
ask the attention of Congress to the valua
ble information aud important recommen
dations relating to tbe public lands, Indian
affairs, the Pacific railroads and mineraldis*
cdveries. contained in the report of the Sec
retaty of the Interior, which is herewith
transmitted, and which report also embra
ces the subjects of patents, pensions and
other topics of public interest pertaining to
his department. The quantity of public
land disposed of during tbe five quarters
ending on the 30th of September last, was
4,221,342 acres, of which 1.578,614 acr^s
were entered under the Homestead law ?
'The remainder was located with military
| land warrants, agricultural scrip certified to
J States for railroads, and sold for cash.
I The cub received from sales and location
J fees was ?1,049; 448. The income from
sales during the fiscal year mding June
. 30th, 1864, was ?67,800,721, against $13,
601,795 received during the preceding year.
Ttiw aggregate of acres surveyed duriug the
year has been equal to the quantity dis
posed of, ftnd there ta open to settlement
about 133,000,000 acres of surveyed land.
The great euterprize of connecting the At
lautic with tue Pacific States by railways
and telegraph liues bad been entered upon
with a vigor that gives assurance of success
notwithstanding the embarrassments aris
ing from the prevailing bign prices of ma*
terial and ltbor. The route of the main
line of road has been definitely located lor
one hundred miles westward from the ini/
tial point at OmabaCity, Nebraska, and a
preliminary location ot the Pacific Railroad
of California has been made from Sacra
mento eastward to the Great Bend of Muck*
er River, in Nevada. Numerous discover
riesofgold, silver and cinnabar mines have
been added to the many heretofore known,
and the country occupied by the Sierra. Ne
vada and the Rocky fountains and the
subordinate ranges now teems with enter
prising labor, which is richly remunerative.
It is believed that the products of the mines
of rich metals in that region has during the
year reached, if not exceeded ?100,000,000
in value. Ic was recommended in my last
annual message that our Indian system ba
remodeled.
Congress at its last session acting upon
the recommendation, did provide lor reor
ganizing the system in California, and it is
believed that under the present organiza'
tiou, the management of tho Indians there
will be attended with reasonable success. ?
Much yet remaius to be done to provide for
the proper government of the Indians in
other parts of the country, to render it se
cure for the advancing settler, and to pio
vide for the welfare of tho Indian. The
Secretary reiterates hi* recommendations,
aud to them the attention of Congress is
invited.
The liberal provisions to invalid soldiers
and sailors of the Republic, and to the
widows, orphan^ and dependent mothers
of those who have fallen in battle, or died
of disease contracted, or of wounds receiv
ed in the service of their country, have been
diligently administered.
'1 here bad been added to the pongion
rolls during the year ending the 30th day of
June last, the names of 16,770 invalid sol
diers, and of 271 disabled seamen, making
the present number of army invalid pen
sionei s 22,767, and of navy iuvalid pension
ers 712, and that of widows, orpLans and
mothers 22 have been placed on the ar
my pension rolls, and 248 ou tbejnavy rolls.
The number of army pensioners of tLis
class is 25,436. and of navy pensions 793.
At the beginning of tho year the number of
revolutionary pensioners was 1,450. Only
twelve of them were soldiers, of whom
seven have since d;< d. The remainder are
those who, under the law, received pensions
because of relationship to Revolutionary
soldiers. Ibe year ending the 30tb
of Jane, 1864, $450,46 1,692 have b?en paid
to bensioners of all classes.
I cheerfully commend fo your continued
gitronwge the beuevolent Institutions of the
istriot of Columbia, wbicb have hitherto
been established or foatered by Congress,
and respectfully refer for information con
oeroing them, and in relation to the Wash
ington Aqueduct, the Capital and other
matters of local interest to the report of
tbe Secretary.
The Agricultu al Department, under the
supervision of iff present energetic and
faithful bead, is rapidly commeudiog itself,
to the great and vital interest it was creat
ed to advance. It is peculiarly the people's
department io wbicb ttej feel more direct*
' ly concerned than ia auy other. I com* '
mend it to the continued, attention and ft f. 1
tering csre of Cjogre**- ,
Tho jrar has continued since tbe last an*
nasi message. All the important lines and
positions then occupied by our forces have ;
been maintained and our armies have stead
Hy advanced, thus liberating the negroee
left in the rear, so that Missouri, Kentucky,
Tennessee, and p&rts of other States, have
again produced remarkably /air crope. The
most remarkable feature io the military
operations of tbe year is General Sherman s
attempted march of three hundred miles
directly through the insurgent region. It
tends to show a great increase of omr rela
tive strength, that our General in Culef
should feel able to confront and hold in
check every active force of the enemy and
jet to detach a lAli appointed large army
to move on such an expedition.
The result not yet being known, con
jectore in regard to it is not here indulged.
Important movements have alao occurred
during the year to the effect of ttofcMtng
society for durability in tbe Union. Al
though short of complete success, it is much
in the right direction ? that twelve hun*
dred citiiens io each of the States of Ar
kansas and Louisiana have organised loyal
Stat a Governments with free Constitutions
and are earnestly struggling to maintain
and administer them.
The movement in the same direction
more extensive, though less definite, in
Missouri, Kentucky and Tennessee, should
not be overlooked. But Maryland presents
tbe example of complete success. Mary
land is secure to liberty and Union for all!
time to come- Tbe genius of rebellion
will no more claim Maryland. Like
another foul spirit, being driven out, it
maj seek to tear her, but it will woo her
no more. At the last aession of Congress
a proposed amendment of the Oonstitu
tion abolishing slavery throughout the
C ited States passed the Senate, but fail-*
ed for lack of the requisite two-thirds
vote in the House of Representatives. AN
though the present is the same Congress,
and nearly tbe same member*, without
questioning the wisdom or patriotism of
those who stood in oppositional venture to
reccomuend the reconsideration and pas*
sage of the measure at the present session.
Of course tbe abstract question is not
changed; but an intervening election shows
almost certainly that tbe next Congress
will pass the tnoasure, if this does not,
hence there is only a question of time, as
to when the proposed amendment will go
to tbe States for their action, and as it is
to so go, at all events, may we not agree
that the sooner the tetter. It is not claim*
ed that the election has imposed a duty on
members to change their views or their
votes any further than as an additional
element to be considered, their judgment
may be effected by it. It is tbe voice of
the people now for the first time beard up
on tbe question.
In a great national crisis like ours, una
nimity of action among tb'se seeking a
common end, is very desirable? almost in
dispensable; and yet no approach to such

J In this case the common end istho m?in

" secure that end, ?;.ch mil through the
election is most clearly ?c
a( such constitutional amendment. mo
mo't relUbl. indication of oublic purpus.
in this country 1. delivered through our
popular elections. J ndpng by the recent
l-snvsts n?d iti result, the purpose or the
people within the loyal States to maintain
'tlx, integrity of the tjnion, was never more
tirm, nor more nearly unanimous than now.
The extraordinary calmness and Rood or?
der with which tbe millions of voters met.
and mingled at the polls, gave strong as
surance of this.
Not only all those who supported the
Union ticket, so called, but a great
of the opposiog party algo may be '*ir'y
claimed to entertain and to be actuated by
the same purpose. It is an unanswerable
argument to this effect that no candidate
for any office, however high or low, has
ventured to seek votes on the avowal that
he was for giving up the Union. There has
been mu-h impugning of motives, and
much heated controversy as to the proper
means ani best mode of advancing the
Union cause; but on the distinct issue of
Union or no Union, tbe politicians have
shown their instinctive knowedge that there
is no diversity smong the people.
In affording to the people the fair oppor.
tunitv of showing, one to another, and to
the world, this firmness, and unanimity of
purpose, the election has been of vast val'
uo to tho National cause The election has
exhibited another fact not less valuable to
be known, the fact that we do not approach
exhaustion in the most important braucb
of National resources, that of living men.
While it is melancholy to reflect that the
war has filled so many graves and carried
mourning to so many hearts ; it is some re
lief to know that compared with the sur
viving, the fallen have been so few? while
corps and divisions and brigades and regi
ments have formed and fought and dwin
dled and gone out of existence, a great
msjority of the men who composed them
are still living.
The same is true of the naval service ?
The election ieturns prove this. 80 many
voters could not else bo found. The States
regularly holding elections now and four
years ago, to-wit: California, Connecticut,
Delaware, Illinois, Indiana, Maine, Mary
land, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota,
Missouri, New Hampshire, New Jersey,
New York, Ohio, Oregon, Pennsylvania,
Rhode Island, Vermont, West Virginia,
Wisconsin cast 3 9g2, Oil votes now, against
3.870,222 ca*t then, showing an aggregate
now of 3.932,011. To this is to be added
33,702 cast now in tbe new States that did
not vote in 1&63, thus swelling theatre
gate to 4,015,773, and tbe net increaaeuur
ing the three years and a half of war. to
145,551.
A table is appended showing particulars.
To tbi-* again should be added tbe number
of soldiers in the field from Mas-acbcsetta,
Rhode Island, New Jersey, Delaware, In
diana, Illinois and California, who, by the
laws of these States, cannot veto awayfrom
their homes, and whijh number cannot be
less that) ninety thousand Nor yet ia tbia
all. The number io tbe trganixed territo
ries is a trifle now to what it was four yeara
ago, wuile thousands ? white and black?
joiu us. as the national arms press bsck the
insurgent lines.
So much is shown affirmatively and ue
gauvely by tbe election. It is not materia
al to enquire how tbe increase has been
pro luoed, or to show tbat it would have
been greater but for the war, which is
probably true. The important fact retQaina
demonstrated that we have mora men now
than we bad when ;he war began; that we
are not ex'aaqsted nor io the process of ex
hacstiou. That we are gainmg Strength,
and may if need be, maio^n the eontest
indefinitely. %s to ?eiL and material
resource* are *? )w more complete and abun
dant than ever.
Tbe national resources then aro unex
hausted, and, as we believe, inexhaiauble
The public purpose to establish and
tain the uatioual authority is unchanged,
and, as we believe, unchangeably The
manner of continuing the effort remains to
choose. On careful consideration of all
the evidenoe accessible, it seems to ae that
do attempt at negotiation with the lnsor<
geant leader could result in any good.

Ths loyal |>eople woald not sustain or allow it
If questions should remaio, we would adjust them
by the peaoefal means of legislation, conference*
oourts an* rotes, operating only in constitutional
and lawful channel*. Some certain and other poi
aible queatioas are aad would be beyond the aiao
utive power to ad ust, as for instanoe the ndmimioa
of members into Congress, and whatever might
reqaire the appropriating of money. The execa
tire power itself would be greatly diminished bv

this ooatrol would be esercisedean be fairly i edged

and amneety, upon the specif ed teras, were offer
ed to all exoept oertatn designated classes and it
vu at the same time published that the excepted
os sns were still Within centemy.ation of special
clemency.
During the year many availed themselves af
the general provision, aad many more would, on

prooeas lass easy and certain. During tbe tamo
time also special pardons have be*n g anted to
Individuals of the exoepted clases, and no talon.

o ?lly the door has been for a full year open to U
1 exoept such as were not in conditio*! to make f rte
choice, that is such as were in custody er ander
constraint. It is still so open to all, but the tine
may come when pUblie duty shall demand that it
, be oiosed, and that In lieu, more rigorou* measures
than heretofore be adopted.
, I prerent the abandonment of armed resis
tance to the national authority on tbe put of tbe
insurgents as the only ind spendable condition t?

i I repeat the declaration made a jew age, tfc*t

If the people shonld, by whatever mode ur
means, ma<s it an elecutive duty to re msliv*
