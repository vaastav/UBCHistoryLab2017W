The Alabama Award.
The tlmclincs9 and necessity of the
recommendation of the President, that
commla9loner3 be appointed by Congress
to examine and adjudicate the claims
known as the "Alabama claims" is al
ready apparent. To be sure, by the
terras of the treaty of Washington, as
well a9 by the award itself, the gross
sura is not payable until one year from
the fourteenth of September, 1872, but
the sum of fifteen and a half millions of
dollars in gold will, on or before the ex
piration of that time, be paid into the
Treasury of the United States. The
United States are, however, simply the
trustees of the fund. They hold it, in
trust, to be distributed and paid to the
parties entitled thereto, when ascertain
ed. It would seem that the course to be
pursued was simple and obvious, and
and that there would and ought to be no
difficulty in closing up the whole matter
and distributing the funds in accordance
with j astice and equity. But it is a large
sum of money, and the claim agent and
lobbyist see in its disposal fat slices in
the shape of fees and percentages. This
is not all. Every one that has a claim
or the shadow of a claim will, of course,
bring it forward. Claims will be as
plenty as Southern loyalists, during the
rebellion, are now found to have been.
The proof 'of .them will be promptly
brought forward, and, as rebel officers
and soldiers found no difficulty in bring
ing forward "clouds of witnesses" in
proof of their perfect loyalty, so will
swift witnesses be pioduced here. The
holders of ficticious or doubtful claims,
their agents and lobbyists, will not only
combine among themselves, but will
form similar combinations with the
owners of real claims and thus endeavor
to force them through Congress. Al
ready the holders of other claims against
the government, some of thorn, perhaps,
just but the majority of them entirely
unfounded and without the shadow of
justice, are moving in the matter and en
deavoring, by bargaining or otherwise,
to tack on to any bill that may be pro
posed for the distribution of the Ala.
bama fund, a provision for the payment
of their claims. The agents of the
"French spoliation claims," as they are
called, are already at work, and hope,
by this "tacking" process, to force their
claims through. The longer action in
the premises Is delayed by Congress, the
larger will be the number of claimants,
individual claims will expand, and other
matters under the pressure may be fore
ed through Congress on the strength and
to the detriment of the actual sufferers
by the piratical depredations of the Ala
bama and other rebel cruisers.
Another question has been raised in
reference to the parties to whom this
fund shall be paid. The New York
World, in a labored article, endeavors to
show that the owners of the vessels de
stroyed, or the insurance companies, by
which they were insured and who paid
the amount of the policies on such ves
sels, fhould not be considered in ronnec
tion with the distribution of the money,
In fact that they are not sufferers or
losers at all. The owners of the vessels
are not entitled to compensation, it says,
because they were reimbursed by the in
surance companies and, therefore, are
not real losers, lhe marine insurance
companies it places in the same predic
ament, because their losses that is the
amount paid by them on their policies
of insurance were more than reimburs
ed by extra premiums thereafter paid by
vessels which escaped destruction. Who
then are or can be considered losers un
der this doctrine? We prefer rather to
hold to the doctrine, as founded both in
law and equity, that the owners of the
vessels or claims at the present time,
whether they be the original owner, the
insurance company who, upon payment
of the insurance, took an assignment of
the claim, or any othor persons, are the
actual sufferers and losers and, as such,
entitled to compensation. We refer to
this Question at this time, not for the
purpose of arguing the point, pro or con,
but os bearing upon the appointment of
commissioners. Looking at the subject
in any view, it seems to us that the wis
dom and propriety of the President's
position are unquestionable. We trust
that Congress wll speedily act upon the
recommendation and dispose of the mat
ter, both as a matter of justice to the
claimants themselves and that this sub
ject may not be used to impede and hin
der legislation or to carry through with
It doubtful or questionable projects.
The Revival of American- Com
merce. Mr. Lynch 9 bill tor the revi
val of American commerce introduced
in the House Tuesday, extends the sys-
tern of drawbacks to all materials, of
whatever kind used in the construction
of vessels, to all ship stores, and allows
a bounty on domestic articles used equal
to the amount of duty which would have
been paid had the articles been imported,
The bill also allows the government to
charter any vessels for the transportation
vi the mails uuilt under its provisions
and to assign naval officsrs to their com
mand. Mr. nail's bill, introduced the
same day. proposes to increase the
American commercial marine by extend
lng the fystem of drawbacks to all ma
terial used iu the construction of vessels
and to allow vessels receiving drawbacks
to encage in the coasting trade four
months annually, instead of two, as
under the law of last session.
Emotioxal Insanity. It we may
judge from a recent very notable case,
the plea of emotional insanity does not
succeed nearly f o well in runs as m ban
Francisco, and Mrs. Fair will do wisely
to restrict her exploits to the latter city
or New York. A young man named
Olivier De Kennel, of position and for
tune in Brittany, killed his brother from
motives of jealousy, and promptly pro
ceeded to surrender himself to justice.
Although the plea of hereditary insanity,
urged for the defense, occasioned a post
ponement pending medical inquiry, the
Assize Court of Finisterre declined to
admit it as a valid excuse for the crime,
and condemned the assassin to penal
servitude for life. An appeal to the
Court of Cassaslon in Paris has only
served to confirm the sentence of the
Court below.
FiBE-fEOOf Wood. Iu th general
discussion which is now gdlng on rela
tive to rendering buildings fire-proof,
little reference has been made to the
process of reuderlng wxl less combus
tible. It has been proved, from a series
f ezperiiscfcts, that wood can be pre-
pared, and at almost a nominal cost, so
that it will not blaze, though exposed to
the most intense heat. The process is
called " burncttizing, " aud is now used
in the preparation of wooden side-walks
and pavements. A building with .bur-
nettized timber would be far safer than
if it had iron beams, for, though they
might crumble in time under the effects
of fierce heat, they would not tarow
down the walls by cither expanding or
contracting. . ,. .,
Overland Telkgbapii to Europe.
The attempt to establish an overland
telegraphic communication with Europe
by way of Alaska, Behring's Straits and
Russia, though a failure as to its main
object has not been without fruitful re
sults. The Russian Government put up
its lines as far as the Amoor river, and
afterwards connected them with the
China and Japan lines. Since 'then the
number of messages forwarded has in
creased in such an unsuspected and un
precedented manner that the Telegragh
Department has resolved to put up an
other wire on the Siberian line, and the
needful orders have been given for the
supply of the materials, and the com
mencement of the work on the section
between Omsk and Tomsk as soon as the
weather will permit nextspring. :
The Oil Combination The great
combination in the Pennsylvania oil re
gions, to force the price'of the crude art
ticle up to five dollars per barrel, begins
to show signs of collapse. It appears
that the artificial increase of price has
produced the natural result of causing
buyers to hold off, so that the combina
tion and its agencies have little or no
business. The cry of "Infamous con
spiracy!" recently raised in the oil re
gions, meaning that the exporters in
New York, Boston and other cities have
decided to keep out of the market,
amounts to nothing. It is one thing to
arbitrarily advance the rates of oil and
wages, and. it is another thing to induce
bujrers or consumers to purchase at the
advanced rates.
Reduction oe Postage. Mr. Hill's
bill for the reduction of postage pro
poses to make the ordinary letter half-
ounce rate two cents ; and Mr. Porter's$
to amend the new postal code, is design
ed to effect a reversal of the Postmaster-
General's ruling that double postage
must be collected on partially-prepaid
letters. Mr. Kellogg in his bill names
April 1. 1873. as the date on and after
which stamps on checks and drafts shall
no longer be required, and provides for
the redemption of unused stamps.
Special Correspondence of the Herald.
Harvard College of To-day.
Editor Rutland Herald ': At length
the winter has opened' and the "Alma
Mater" sits in a robe, white as the beard
of affection with which she holds guard
over tire welfare of her sons.
During the last two yearsfthe college
has taken rapid strides of advancement,
while the past vacation has been singu
larlv prolific of improvements and ex
ecutive progression.
Ut the internal novelties mere are i wo
which claim particular attention. The
first consists in the fact that .the elective
system of studies, which of late has prov
ed such an advantage and growing power
at Cambridge, has been thrown open to
all collegians, irrespective of class, the
only requisite of admission being the
proper amount of proficiency to enter
higher or a lower grade in each depart
ment. The incalculable benefits of this
design are manifest in that it abolishes
the prescribed form of studies for each
year and allows the student to adopt a
consistent course during his collegiate
term. ,
This, too, is the first year iu which
the college throws open its porches to its
own graduates, as well as to those of
other colleges. A flattering recognition
of this benefit appears in the quite nu
merous return of Alumni to enjoy dec
tive courses, which heretofore were pre
eluded as being beyond the allowable
amount of college work. The present
list of elective studies is extremely broad
comprising, as it does, nine languages.
beside a treatise upon the philology ot
the romance languages, by an eminent
linguist ; a system of philosophy in six
courses, eleven subjects in mathematics,
physics, natural history' and music.
Around the magenta banner of the
college, centre nine schools of variou
pursuits the academic, divinity, law
medical, scientific, mining and practical
geology, dental, astronomical, and the
Bussev institute of agnculture.
The increase in the sizes of the classes
has this year resulted in the completion
of two elegant dormitories. Weld and
Matthews halls, 'besides the enlargement
of Appleton chapel.
After the necessary three-day conflict
the agony and the necessary suspension
of normal existence, the Freshman class
resolves into the goodly number of one
hundred and ninety-eight, each member
of which may plume himselt upon not
inferior mental abilities, so to have sur-
vived the examinations'based upon the
already much advancedgstandard ot re-
ouirements.
Weld and Matthews halls are the only
additions within the yard. "Weld," sit
uated between "Boylston" and "Univer
sity, is extremely unique in its antique
architecture, the Elizabethan style. It
is built of brick, with light sandstone re
lief, and contains rooms and halls finish
ed in oak, with every late improvement
even to the elevator.
The vis-a-vis of this elegant structure
is "Matthews," somewhat larger, but
none the less elegant. This hall is com
modious, graceful in design and of elab
orate finish. The airy rooms and broad
window-seats suggest many a languid
doles far niente. The majority of the
studies are brave in bay windows, while
every modern improvement meets the
eye, from the heated halls to the perfect
system of ventilation.
These two ornamental edifices aid ef
fectually in relieving of its sombre aus
terity and prosy gloom the Harvard of
the past.
Alumni hail in the "Uelta promises
to be magnificent in the extreme. It is
composed of red and black bricks, while
at its end a tower ot appropriate dimen
sions, after the Moorish style, rises, from
the top of which the rain is made to es
cape through the mouths of grotesque
dragons. The interior is still m a state
of chaos, yet indicates a future grandeur
commensurate to the generosity of its
projectors.
At a short distance is visible the A
azzi museum, the completion of which
is as yet a thing of the future. Much
that is of interest may even now be seen
but the mass of the marvelous, rnaludm
the grand collection of Brazilian butter-
nies, lies in tne cases which range in
rows up and down the weary length of
the hails.
A few minutes' walk and the botani
cal gardens and observatory are in view
The high gate is passed and the frost-
blighted, deserted gardens spread a dos
olate plain around, but the interiors of
the conservatories present sights of be
wildering delight to the eonnoiseur. The
main green-house is arched and the site

The observatory, with us mysterious
domes and appurtenances, aie arcana to
which the multitudes arc treated in
much the same manner as the "King of
ranee" who "with forty thousand men
went up a hill and so came down again."
Some six miles from Cambridge, in the
town of West Roxbury, is situated the
Bussev Institute, a school tor agricul
ture and horticulture, established in ex
ecution of the trusts created by the will
of the late Benjamin Bussey. The ob
iect of the school is to afford the student
the mtormation ana souna oasis upon
which to practice the arts of agriculture,
useful and ornamental gardening and
stock-raising. The instruction is im
parted by lectures, recitations and prac
tical teaching, as well as exercise in the
labratory, the green-house and the field.
The course occupies three years, the first
of which is to be passed at the Lawrence
Scientific School at Cambridge, the two
subsequent at West Roxbnry. The final
ear oners the attractive features, treat
ed by eminent professors, of the theory
and practice of farming, horticulture,
agricultural chemistry, applied zoology,
with entomology and the qualitative an
alysis. As yet the institute is in an un
finished state ; notwithstanding, the ap
pointments and location appear to be ex
tremely appropriate. The building itself
is ot eracetut design and composed or
the admired material, indigenous to the
neighborhood, the Koxbury pudding
stone. Upon the lower noor is the spa
cious entrance hall, from which lead the
large lecture rooms, small recitation
rooms and 1 the labratory. Above are
numerous halls and rooms, as yet unoc
cupied. The grounds are extensive,
comprising, beside. tne portions appro
priated to root, hay and grain crops,
harvesting and the propagation of plants,
grapery, green-houses, gardens and
fields. This proiect is fortunately star
red, both as to the support of its ample
endowment, the smile of nature and the
accumulated talent of its board ot in
structors.

Correspondence of the Herald.
A Model Farm.
Editor Rutland Herald : Pleasant
Praire. Wisconsin, is six miles west of
Kenosha and Kenosha is a dull little
town, its greatest attraction being that
it is situated on the shore or that sur
passingly beautiful inland sea. Lake
Michigan, l'leasant l'rairie is a tanning
town, and there is a "pleasant prairie
farm," owned by G. Truesdell. There
are other farms in Pleasant Prairie, but
in comparison to this one, might as well
not be. The farm consists of twelve
hundred acres, well cultivated and
stocked, and charmingly situated on
this beautiful rolling prairie of Wiscon
sin. Two miles back of the farm build
ings rises a well wooded ridge, making a
beautiful fringe to the meadow lands.
The O'Plain river runs through the
meadows : a black, sluggish stream, not
to be compared to the clear, rushing
streams of Vermont. The rivers are
like human nature the active keep
clear and bright, while the sluggish are
sloomv and morbid, and any adverse
disturbance agitates their smooth surface
unpleasantly. Nor do "still waters al
wavs "run deep. 1 he U f lain river is
neither deep nor sparkling, but is a good
resort tor innumerable flocks of wild
sreese. and in their season water lilliee
abound.
One hundred and seventy cows are
milked on the farm the cattle in all
numbr.r two hundred : fifty horses and
two hundred horrs making up the live
stock.
The barn in which the cows are sta
bled is two hundred feet long, and the
main barn thirty more. The stables are
surrounded on three sides by an ample
yard, floored, which is cleaned every
fall. The water troughs in the yard
are filled by a wind mill, which pumps
the water into an elevated tank, trom
which it is carried to all the buildings on
the farm. A truck rims the whole length
of the cow stables, through the main
barn and one hundred feet more devoted
to the housing ot porkers, ( a is ut pre
pared feed are run on this track. Per
forated iron pipes run through the ecu
ter and on each side of the floor of the
car. The corn stalks and hay is cut up,
put into the car with meal, sprinkled
with water irom a well in the barn,
which is pumped by the engine and car
ried with hose, and then steamed.
The engine house is back of the main
barn, its lofty smoke-stack presenting a
conspicuous appearance. An engine is
constantly employed. The engine runs
a grist mill, threshes, saws wood, pumps
water and steams the feed.
The milk is made into cheese at the
farm house; two cheese makers are Em
ployed, with the milk from two other
dairies, of lesser magnitude. Nine
cheese are made every day, weighing
forty-five pounds each. The milk is put
in a large vat, and heated by a small en
gine in t he room. The cheese commands
the highest market price in Chicago.
Twenty men are employed on the
farm all foreigners and mostly Danes
They are boarded at the farm house,
their rooms, with a sitting-room occu
nvin? a wins of the house. There is a
blacksmith shop, and a blacksmith em
ployed by the year, a carpenter shop and
slaughter house inde6d, the farm is a
small community in itself.
The Register shows visitors from all
parts ot the country. particular pains
is taken to show them around. One city
lady expressed much solicitude for the
cows, upon having it explained to her
how they were stanchioned. She thought
they must be unhappy, fastened in that
way. I thought they appeared remark
ably happy when I walked through the
stable at milking time, the superinten
dent saying, "there are one hundred and
three or four stanchioned on one side and
sixty-five on the other." The long rows
of horns presented decidedly an inter
esting spectacle. I remarked that the
cows seemed to be chewing "cuds of
contentment," but the superintendent
thought is was "grass," undoubtedly it
was it is the difference between senti
ment and sense.
Vermonters will find "Pleasant Prairie
Farm" an interesting place to visit on
their Western tours. It is easy of access,
and they will receive every attention

Marsh, who was formerly ot Vermont

Lake StPEiuoR Tin Discoveries.
According to the Portage Lake Gazette,
the obscure question of the existence of
tin on the north shore of Lake Superior
bids fair to receive elucidation. that
paper says: "The unaccountable mys
tery that has surrounded the claimed dis
covery of tin upon the north shore of
Lake Superior, and the unenviable re
lations that have existed between the dis
coverer and certain parties to whom he
bad sold interests, will, it is believed
soon culminate in a certain knowledge
of either the" worthlessness or value of
the find. A party of gentlemen repre
senting large interests in the property,
together with several experts and press
representatives, started last week with
the original discoverer, who proposes to
fully satisfy them ot the genuiness of
his claim.

Latest Discoveries in the Polar
Regions. tj 'V
Although the North Pole has not yet
been reached, notable progress has re
cently been made in the exploration of
the zone of which it is the center. Dur
ing the past summer, several voyages
have been accomplished ; "and of the re
sults thereby determined, we are now
beginning to learn the first particulars.
Dr.' Augustus retermann, the eminent
German geographer, has received ad
vices, via Norway, that the land at the
east of the Islands of Spitzbergen, of
which the position has frequently
changed on the charts during the past
two centuries, has at last been reached,
and that, during the month of August
last, it was thoroughly explored by Cap
tain Nils Johnsen, of Tromsoe. Anoth
er Norwegian captain, Altmann of Ham-
merfest, although reaching the same lo
cality, tailed, to make observations ot
any importance, so that it was reserved
for Captain Johnsen te complete the
work. He left Tromsoe for the fisheries
of Nova Zembla in the yacht Lydiana
with a crew or nine men. At the be
ginning of June, says Dr. Petermann,
he shaped his course toward the western
part ot the vast sea which extends be
tween the islands of Spitzbergen and
Nova Zembla. During the latter part of
the same month he arrived some eighty
kilometers to the southeast of the Ryk
Is islands (a little group off the east
coast of Spitzbergen) and in' the midst
of a great polar current that transports
enormous quantities of ice toward the
eastern shores of the Spitzbergen and
Baren Islands. In the following July
and August, the ice current turned more
to the eastward, leaving the western
half of the sea comparatively clear.
Captain Johnsen, who meantime was
making large hauls ot nsh on the spitz
bergen banks, suddenly discovered, on
the afternoon of the 16th of August,
that he had been carried to over 78 de
grees north latitude, and shortly after
perceived the land whicii it is believed
appears on the charts of 1617 under the
name of Wiche or Gillis Land. Finding
the sea open at the east and southeast
shores of the island, Johnsen anchored
his vessel near the northeast point, at
latitude about 79 degrees north, and dis
embarked in order to explore the sur
roundings, to ascend a mountain near
the coast, and also to obtain a supply of
the wood which he saw in enormous
quantities on the beach. The main is
land he found to be accompanied by
others smaller in extent. On no portion
of the land could extended snowfields be
seen, une glacier was vismie on me
southeast coast, while numerous streams
of clear water were apparent.
The length of the island between its
furthest points was determined to be for
ty-four marine miles, lhe drmwood
had accumulated in vast heaps, hundreds
of feet from the shore, and as high as
twenty feet above the sea level. The
principal animals inhabiting the polar
regions were observed, anu especially
the Greenland seal which appeared in
immense numbers. The explorers evince
considerable surprise at the reindeer,
which they state are fatter and larger in
size than any they had ever seen. On
the back ot one ot these animals tat
was found over three inches in thick-
tt ! ,1
ness. specimens oi argillaceous ana
quartziferous rock were collected, and
with some fossil vegetation, torwarded
to museums in Europe for examination.
On the evening of the I ah of August
Johnsen departed, following the south
ern and southeastern shores of the island.
There w as no ice except on the north
coast, while in a northeasterly 'direc
tion the sea was open as lar as the eye
could reach. Regarding the Austrian
expedition of Payer and Wieprecht, we
have news as late as tne zutn or August.
At that date the expedition was near
the Isle of Barentz, 70 degrees 7 min
utes north latitude, and 58 degrees 24
minutes longitude east of Paris. There
is little of novelty communicated other
than that the temperature of the sea, as
taken, verifies the figure adopted by Dr.
Ptterman, on the charts. "Much thick
ice has been encountered," says M. Pay
er, "but with the aid of steam we have
no difficulty in penetrating it." Sien

CHEESK.
The market at Utica, Monday, was a
meagre affair. About 3,000 boxes were
ottered, of which not over 1,200 were
sold at 13a13e. For one lot, 13ic. was
offered, but we did not learn whether it
was accepted. Considerable cheese was
sent on commission. Most of the fac
tories that sold, we understood, sold the
balance of the season's make.
At Little Falls the market showed
signs of a speedy closing for the season.
Prices and sales were lower than they
were last week,'buyers and sellers fewer,
and the quality of the cheese pooror,
Nearly all ot the October make was
closed out. Sexeral factories sold their
final make for this year. What Novcin
ber make there was m the market was
more or less skimmed, and ot course
lowered the ruling figure. There will
not be much doing at this market after
next week, as most of the November
cheese will have been disposed of by
that time. There were about 600 boxes
of private dairy sold to-day. The range
of prices was from 913c. We hear
of only one lot that brought the latter
figure. The ruling figures were 1213c,
Offerings of factory amounted to 5,000
boxes ; 2,500 of these were sold at 12c.,
and lojc.' as the extreme figures, and
13Jc. as the ruling.
The receipt of cheese at Boston for
the week was 1,125 boxes and Z tons
The market remained quiet, and sales
were principally at 1414c for choice
factory, and 1314c lor dairy. An oc
casional mild factory was sold at 15c,
but this was an extra price.
The receipts at New York, for the
week ending Saturday last, were 38,607
boxes, and the exports were 6,952 boxes,
the cable was 65s. Gold closed at 112J,
"and the highest price for cheese was 14c.
For the corresponding week last year
the receipts were 37,725 boxes, and the
exports were 5,472 boxes. The cable
was 60s. Gold closed at 110J, and the
highest quotation for cheese was 14c.
Shippers, it is said, showed more disposi
tion to buy, but freight room was so
scarce as to check operations.
BUTTER.
The quotations for butter at St. Al
bans, Tuesday, were : medium to good,
2530c ; choice, 3132c ; selections, 32c.
At Little Falls, Monday, 250 packages
of butter were sold, 3031c being the
ruling price, and 32c the extreme.
At Utica the market was a little de
pressed, Monday, but with no change of
quotations.
The receipts of butter in Boston for
the week was 9,015 packages, against
10,887 packages for the correspending
week last year. There was no material
change in the market. The demand was
quite moderate and on common and me
dium grades the tendency of prices con
tinued in favor of buyers. Really choice
lots sustained full rates and all received
were readily placed. The sales of New
York and Vermont fall made were at
33a34ci which v'was ! the highest . for
round lots, although some small parcels
of gilt edged commanded l2c per lb.
more;' Good to choice summer dairies
ranged from 2530c per pound. The
best Western fall made readily com
manded 2730c in lots but poorer grades
were very slow of sale.
., In New York, according to Was -Producer'
Price-Current, the market was
less buoyant at the close than at the
opening of the week. In medium and
low grades of State the business has
been very light and prices have rather
favored the buyer. Prime shipping fir
kins are firmly held but are inactive, the
Southern .markets being well supplied
and dull at figures which afford ship
pers little margin. From the quotations
of newspapers and from correspondence
from the interior of the State it is quite
apparent that butter is about as high
there as here. We presume .that our
city wholesale buyers will be very care
ful about operating at the rates now
current. We usually have a quiet market
in December and until sometime after
the holidays, and our stock is quite liber
alin all grades. We think the fall make
has been as large as usual. We learn
that there is a large supply of butter in
Canada the present condition of the
English market warrants the belief that
wre will have a good deal of this butter
here to compete with State and Western
later in the season. There is also a pos
sibility, to be borne in mind, that Cali
fornia will bo able to send us a good deal
of fresh butter in February and March
next.

Mr. Randall of Pennsylvania offered
a resolution calling on the Secretary of
the Treasury for information as to what
law authorizes him to make an" in
creased issue of legal tender notes, as
was done in October last, and whether
such issue was made in the legal tender
notes heretofore retired or in new ones.
After some" discussion by Messrs. Ran
dall, Dawes, Brooks and Garfield, the
latter stating that the issue of legal ten
der notes last October had taken the
country by surprise, the resolution was
adopted.

Washington, Dec, 4.
At the expiration of the morning hour
the House went into committee of the
whole, Mr. Stevenson in the chair, and
distributed the President's message
among appropriate committees.
The question of referring the subject
of the postal telegraph provoked some
discussion. Mr. Wood of New York
preferred to have it referred to a special
committee, and Mr. Dawes of Massachu
setts, and Beck of Kentucky, favoring
its reference to the committee on appro
priations, it having been before that
committee at the last session.
Mr. Niblack of Indiana, .a member of
he appropriation committee, regarded
the postal telegraph matter as one of the
crravest Questions before Congress. It
had always been to him a startling pro
position, and although he was growing
accustomed to it, he was still not used to
it, and desired to be classed as an oppo
nent of the measure. While he favored
leaving the matter with the committee
on appropriations this session, he would
be prepared at the next session to advo
cate its reference either to a select com
mittee or to some standing committee,
which would have more time at its dis
posal than the committee on appropri
ations.
The matter was finally referred to the
committee on appropriations.
The centennial celebration was, after
discussion, refeired to a select committee
of nine.
The committee rose and the House ad
journed. rgypl and Abyssinia.
The Levant HeraM, which, by the
way, has just been again suspended for
some paltry criticism on the Turkish
government., is "in a position to state
that some of the European representa
tives in Constantinople have formally
asked for iuformation from the Ottoman
Minister for Foreign Affairs relative to
the reported Egyptian expedition to
Abyssinia, and that his Excellency has
replied that he had received no commu
nication from the Khedive on the sub
ject." Of course this does not s mean
that the Turkish Foreign Oflice is ignor
ant of the proceedings and object of the
expedition. It is satisfactory, however,
to learn that some questions have been
been put to the Ottoman authorities on
the subject-; and it is, moreover, to be
hoped that the European powers will
veto the alleged annexation scheme of
the Khedive. The advance further of
Egypt towards Abyssinia would secure
to the Jellabs some extensive slave
hunting grounds in a direction where we
should be comparatively powerless to
check them, thereby opening a new
door to the inhuman trafiic in lieu of that
which we are now bent upon closing on
the East Coast of Africa.
As every one knows, the ostensible ob
ject of the Khedive in dispatching the
expedition under Sir Samuel Baker was
to establish Egyptian colonies on the
White Nile in order to put a stop to the
slave trade in that region. If we are to
believe the report published some short
time ago in the Nw York Herald of an
interview with the Viceroy, that expe
dition has, signally failed to effect his
Highness' object, which accounts so
some think for his having turned his
thoughts towards Abyssinia. Accord
ing to the authority just quoted, his
Highness is greatly displeased with Sir
Samuel's proceedings. " Sir. Samuel
went to the White Nile," he is made to
say, "to create trade, not to destroy it :
but instead of extending our commerce
in that direction he has ruined it. It is
impossible now to travel along the banks
of the river in safety. The tribes are
hostile to the government, aud his war
of conquest has rendered our dominion
there less secure and more delusive than
ever. Formerly our authority extended
beyond Gondokoro, aud sir Samuel
Baker ha9 added nothing whatever to it.
When he started at the head of that
great expedition he found there scarcely
any trafiic in -blaves. The suppression
of - that traffic has considerably injured
our interests ; nevertheless we hoped to
retain some trade with the natives. Now
all is at an end. I regret what Sir Sam
uel Baker has done, inasmuch as he has
made those ignorant and short-sighted
people believe that Egypt is their ene
my." We fear that, as far as the repres
sion of the slave trade is concerned, Sir
Samuel Baker's expedition will end in a
fiasco, as4 was predicted of it by well'
informed Turks and Egyptians at the
time. He has been made the victim of
his own enthusiasm, which was availed
of as a sop to British philanthropy. His
whereabouts now seem uncertain ; the
Khedive disbelie veshis having reached Al
bert the Nyanza, but he seems to be aware
that his position is one of great danger,
being entirely cut off from supplies for
his escort, consisting of from l,UW to
1,500 men. .

A GENuunt Centenarian. In ac
knowledging the toast of "The Press,'
proposed by Lord Lyttelton, at the late
omplimantary dinner to Mr. W. J.
Thorns late editor of Note and Queries,
Mr. Shirley Brooks introduced a refer
ence to the centenary of the London
Morning Post. The keen scrutiny which
Mr. Thorns has always instituted into
cases of alleged longevity, is pretty well
known. Mr. Brooks begged leave to as
sure Mr. Thorns that, now he had re
signed his jurisdiction over press anec
dotes, he should be persecuted with sto
ries which he could not stamp out, and
that the speaker himself had been about
Yorkshire and elsewhere? collecting a
goodly assortment of biographies of
venerable persons who had seen the co
ronation of George HI., and had attend
ed his marriage with Queen Charlotte.
Further, that the very next morning the
infliction should begin, and that Mr.
Thorns should find an undoubted cente
narian at the breakfast table, in the form
of the Morning Post, which that day
had completed its hundredth year. He
hoped, notwithstanding, that Jlr. moras
would sleep comfortably that night.
The tribute to Mr. Thoms's good service
in demolishing "silly season" inventions
was received with much applause.

LIVIXG ADVERTISEMENTS.
A medicine that has done more than all
the prescriptions of the pbarmacopaela to
protect the human system against the
bodily i ills superinduced by unhealthy
surroundings, is certainly worthy of uni
versal confidence. It Is mainly on ac
count of its extraordinary preventive
properties that Hostetter's Stomach Bit
ters is so exceedingly popular in localities
subject to the visitatlou of miasmatic fe
vers and other diseases produced by em
poisoned air. A family that has escaped
sickness during a sickly season in con se
ntience of using the Bitters as a safearuard.
in a living advertisement of the virtues of
the preparation. The whole neighbor
hood realizes the fact. "I couldn't have
believed it," said one. "I scarcely credit
ed the advertisements ; hut one must be
lieve what one sees," says another. "It is
the very thing we need in this unwhole
some section of the country," remarks a
third. And the result is that the instinct
of self-defense, the first law of nature, in
duces three-fourths of that community to
obtain a supply of the great vegetable an
tidote before the next sickly season sets
in. In winter, when the system requires
extra vigor and elasticity to enable it to
bailie the effects ef damp and cold, the
Bitters will be found particularly service
able. BheumatUm will not be apt to fas
ten upon muscles and nerves that have
been braced up by this excellent invigor
ant and nervine ; nor will the severities of
the season, which have such a disastrous
elt'ect on the pulmonary organs of the fee
ble and delicate, be likely to exercise the
same untoward influencw in cases where
the stomach and external surface of the
body (which always sympathizes with the
digentive organs) have been toned and
st imulated by a course of the restorative.
The fits of indigestion and irregularities
of the bowels which proceed from sudden
changes of weather mav always be averted
by a timely use of the Bitters.
I'ROGKESS OF THE REVOLUTION. A new
light dawned upon the world with the in
troduction of Plantation Bitters twelve
years ago. Drastic purgation went out
restoration and renovation came In. The
eyes of the people were opened to the
great fact that the way to cure disease is
to strengthen and support its victims, not
to place them at its mercy by depriving
them of the little strength they have. It
goon became evident that as a means of in
fusing vitality into the feeble system, reg
ulating the secretions, curing indigestion,
and reforming a bilious habit of body, no
medicinal preparation then known was at
all comparable to the new restorative.
Since then hundreds f attempts ' have
been made to rival the Bitters. They have
all failed, and the grand revolution in
medical treatment, which was commenced
in ist0, is still in progress. Xothirg can
stop it, for it is founded on the principle,
now universally acknowledged, that phy
sical vigor is the most formidable antago
nist of all human ailments, and experience
has shown that l'lantation Bitters is a
peerless invigorant, as well as the best pos
sible safeguard against epidemic diseases
