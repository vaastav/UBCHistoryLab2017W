WASHINGTON , Dec. 4. The first regular
session of tlio rifty-thlrd congress convened
nt hlgli noon today pursuant to the constitu
tional provisions. The "Inaudible nnd
noiseless foot of time" Imd apparently
tripped lightly through the lives during t'.io
brief vacation period and brighter faces
greeted one another than when , thirty odd
days wo , tired and showing signs of n par-
llumentnry struggle uncqualed In the history
of the government , the representatives of
the states loft the national capltol. All
traces of that inomorablo batllu seemed ef
faced and the greeting among senators bore
tno evidence of warm fraternal friendship
nnd personal regard.
The senate eliainocr presented n handsome
nnpeorance , arrayed In Its winter apparel.
A Brussels carpet , plcr.smg to the eye and
soft to the touch , had supplanted the light
chlnU matting which covered the floor
during the recent , extraordinary session.
Highly polished desks ana chairs awaited
senatorial use , whllo the happy owners of
sixteen smiling llttlo faces sat on the steps
of each sldo of the vice president's rostrum ,
eager to carry out the wishes of the sen
ators.
On some of the desks were lloral designs
and llowors whoso fragrance sweated the at
mosphere and lent an additional charm to
the scone. On the desk of the vice presi
dent reposed a basket of roses , whllo a hand
some floral horseshoe awaited Senator Voor-
hccs , ( he gift of admiring Indiana friends ,
who also remembered his collenjno , Senator
Turplo. A largo hunch of rosea lay on the
desk of Senator Dolph , and the doughty
champion of the white metal , Senator Slew-
nrt , was the recipient of a basket of beauti
ful Marcchal Niels. Senators Harris , Perry ,
Proctor , Hansbrough and others were also
favored with flowers.
In the galleries a largo crowd had gain-
cicdto witness the opening of the session
nml ttiu bright colors in the Indies' goxvns
and bonnets were the more conspicuous
because of tlio sombcr-hucd background. As
tlio ii'asslvo cloelc over the main entrance
announced the hour of 11 ! the blind chaplain
wits led to the vice president's desk , and ,
after an eloquent prayer , while all senators
present In the chamber remained .standing ,
Vice President Stevenson called the senate
to order.
Joint t/'omm'.tlcn Deputed.
At the suggestion ot Mr. Sherman tlio roll
was called nnd fifty-six senators responded.
The usunl resolutions notifying the house of
representatives of the meeting ot the senate
nnd the resolution for u committee of two
senators to join a similar committee of
the house to wait , upon the president
nnd inform him that congress had
assembled and was ready to receive any
communication no might desire to make ,
were offered and agreed to. The chair ap
pointed McPhuMon of Now Jersey and Mr.
Sherman of Ohio as tlio committee on the
part > tf the senate. After a resolution had
Iron adopted that the hour of daily moot
ing of the scnato should , bo 112 o'cloi-k.-on
the motion of Senator Harris u recess at
lii-lOwns taken forono hour to enable ttio
committee to wilt , on the president.
At the expiration of the recess , nt 1:10
p. m. , the scnato resumed Its session and ro-
ccivcd a message fiom ttio house of repre
sentatives announcing that a quorum of the
house was present and that n committee had
been appointed to Join n similar committee
of the scnato to wait upon the president.
Tiien another recess of twenty minutes was
taken upon motion of Mr. Harris of Tcnnes-
leo. Promptly at 1:110 : the scnato resumed
Its session nna Mr. McPhor.son of the com
mittee to wait upjn the president appeared
lit tlio bar of the senate and announced that
tlio president would communicate wiln the
house In writing.
hcnutorH IVorn't Mucli Intercitod.
Executive Clnrk Prudon at once stepped
forward und delivered the message , nnd It
wus laid before the scnato by the vice prcsi-
dcnt.who directed Its reading. The secretary
ol the senate , Mr. Cox , then reud the mes
sage.
sage.All present , with few exceptions , gave
close attention when the reading was begun.
Senator Cameron seemed ut first moro inter
ested in n newspaper when the secretary
began his tusk , but soon laid it aside nnd
aftcnvnrds listened intently tor u short
timo. Senator Dolph gave attention to his
old file of bills for a few moments , but
jirlcued up hlscarsas the reading reached
the Hawaiian paragraph. Senator Cordon
found opportunity to prepare u brief bill
during the progress of iho rending , while
Senator Hoar was apparently moro inter
ested in u newspaper than in the first part
of the message.
lliiMiill l.nli Out.
There wns a general changing about in
the seats of senators when the portion of thu
document -dealing with Hawaii was up-
proaclieil , Many of tlio senators had. how
ever , anticipated the secretary's reading by
turning tn their printed copies to this .por
tion , so that few of them npparonttv ob-
terved that the page cotUaluinjr iho presi
dent's biloC communication on Hawaii wus
turned without being reud by iho secretary.
Senator ICylo wus ono of the few senators
who followed the reading sufficiently uloso to
observe the cmislon , and ho called attention
lo the oversight by sending up a note calling
attention to the fact.
After this Incident there wns an evident
falling oft in the interest shown by the sena
tors , but the attention wus renewed when
the paragraph concerning bonds wns read.
When this paragraph wns passed senators
gradually left their scats nml drifted out
into the cloak rooms , so that by the tlmo
the rending had been two-thirds concluded
there were only twenty-live senators tn tno
chamber nnd a majority of these wcro en-
paced In conversation among themselves.
The rending of thu mess-ago wus concluded
at U o'clock , having occupied approximately
one hour und u half.
Ilnlpli U'nnlod to Kuoxr.
Mr. Dolph of Oregon immediately rose and
said there had beep distributed In tlio senate
printed copies ot what purported to bo the
jncssago of the president , in which , on page
V , he found u pail of u page devoted to Ha-
wall and ho did not hoar that portion read
Irom tlio deslc. , He desired to Know , and
thought the country did also , whether thai
part was Inadvertently or purposely omitled
by the secretary or whether the coplei
jvhleh hud been circulated wcro not true
cople.8 of the inebsuiri' . ,
The vice president responded thai iho portion
tion of tlio message relating to Hawaii had
teen inadvertently omitled by the secretary
nnd directed ihut It be read.
'Jhls wns done and Mr , Dolph gave notleo
that ho would lomoirow address the senate
on that part of this message.
The message was ordered to llo on iho
table.
Numerous petitions were presented and
many bills introduced nnd referred to appro
priate committees. A Joint resolution per
mitting Colonel An&on Mills , U , S. A. , lo
furvu .is engineer on Iho commission lo sur
vey and llx iho boundary between the United
Stales and Mexico was passed.
A message wus rct-eh cil from iho house
aiinouni-ing the death of IIou L'hurlesO'Neill
and Hon. William Lilly , lulo representatives
of Pennsylvania , Mr t'uucronof Pcnnsyl-
\a la offered a ivsolullon expressive of the
nornnv ot thoboiiutorsut tht'Bad Intelligence ,
eud Senators yuay.MaudursouCu'ey , , Smith
nnd ICylo erc appointed a committee on the

WASIIIXOTOX , Dec. 4. The encircling gal
leries ot the house wcro filled to overflowing
with eager and expectant nervous when
Speaker Crisp , dignified nnd stately , as
cended the rostrum nt high noon toJay and
rapped the regular session ot the Fifty-third
congress to order. i'Mlly UOO members
were in their scats. Conspicuous upon the
floor wcro the two vacant chairs of Repre

of the house , and his colleague , Mr. Lilly ,

itors when the house convened were ex-
Postmaster Don M. Dickinson of Michigan.
Hcv. Mr. Bagby , in his Invocation , re
ferred to the death of "Father" O'Neill nnd
Mr. Llllv. According to the rules ut the
opening of the .session , the speaker then
directed thc-derk to call the roll to ofllclally
ascertain the presence of n quorum.
Chairman Sayers from the appropriations
committee asked unanimous consent fet the
consideration of a bill appropriating & )0,000
additional to pay the salaries of ofllelals en
gaged in the enforcement , of thoChinese
deportation and registration act of last May
und the amendment to that act passed ut
the extra session. .
Mr. Baker of Now York objected. Ho
afterwards withdrew his objection , how
ever , nnd thu resolution wus passed.
Mr. Hlnes of Pennsylvania asked unani
mous consent for the consideration of a reso
lution 'or the appointment of u committee ot'
live to Investigate the Lohlgh Vullev strike ,
Its cnuscs , thu loss of life nnd properly and
to recommend any feasible general legisla
tion for the prevention of strikes in the fu
ture.

Mr. ICilgoro of Texas obtcctcd and the
resolution "was referred umtcr the rule.
Upon motion of Mr. Dockcry , the house
then , at 1'J : , " ) , took a recess until 1:10 : p.m.
There \Vrts n Jnorum I'rocnt.
The roll call showed 210 members present
General Grosvenor of Ohio then escorted 11 ,
S. Bundy of Ohio , elected to succeed the late
Representative Enochs , to the bar of the
house , and the speaker , with up
lifted hands , administered the oath of
office to him. The formal resolutions neces
sary to set the wheels of the legislative machine -
chino in order adopted , the tirst by Mr.
Savers notifying the senate that u quorum
was present in the house and that It was
ready to proceed to business , and the second
by Mr. Wilson for the appointment of a
committee of three to join a like committee
from the scnato nnd inform thu president
that congrrss was ready to receive any com
munication.
The speaker appointed Messrs. Wilson ,
Outhwuito und Burrows. Mr. Griffin the
successor of thu lute Mr. Chlpman of De
troit , was sworn in nnd following this
various reports of bureau ofllcers were taken
from the speaker's table and formally laid
before the house.
At 1:23 : the committee appointed by the
house marched down the center nislo and
faced Mr. Wilson , the chairman , and an
nounced that they had discharged their
duty , and that the president had said bo
would immediately communicate a message
in writing.
lloiv the Mctimco AVua Listened To.
At 1:30 : p. m. Mr. Pruden , the white house
executive clerk , "appeared with the presi
dent's message and Speaker Crisp laid It
before the house , Clerk ICcrr reading It In a
clear voice. The galleries remained silent
and the .members , leaning forward in their
chairs-listened attenlivoly to Mr. Cleve
land's views ns they fell from the lips of the
clerk of the house.
Durimr the reading of the first portion of
the message , relating to our foreign rela
tions , ex-Speaker Thomas Heed burst
through u side door and came running across
the-area in front of the speaker's rostrum.
When ho reached his seat ho deliberately
lighted a cigar und sat puffing nway com
placently while-tho reading proceeded. As
the reference to the Hawaiian affair was
reached the members straightened up nnd
g'avc the closest possible attention , but no
expression , eitherof npprovnl or disapproval ,
was indulged in. There seemed to bo a gen
eral feeling of disappointment that so little
space wus allotted to this question.
The recommendations relative to an In
ternational monetary conference and the re
quest for further authority for the Issue of
bonds caused many significant shakes of the
head un the part of the extreme silver men.
The president's bold endorsement of the
i.enslon policy of the Interior department ,
of civil service retorm , nnd his appeal for
rigid economy in appropriations also at
tracted attention.
TiirllMYtclied Tllum.
When the reference to the tariff was
reached the members crowded nbout the
clerk's desk. The forceful utterances relnl-
ing lo iho duty of congress nnd iho liearty
endorsement given the Wilson bill seemed to
please the domocrallo incmberH groally , but
much surprise was shown when that part of
the message was read stating thni ihe ways
and means had embraced In its plan several
additional revenue tar.es and a small tax on
the Incomes of certain corporations. As it
wns * understood the Internal revenue fea
tures and the income lux had not been abso
lutely decided upon , the president's an
nouncement came in the nature of a surprise.
A roar of applause greeted the conclusion
of the ro.idlng of the message. /
General Blngham , who hud been selected
by the Pennsylvania delegation to make iho
announcement of the death of Representa
tives O'Neill and Lilly , was recognized ,
A commltleo consisting of Messrs. Mc
Dowell und Mutchler of Pennsylvania ,
Northull of Ohio , Hoblnson of Pennsylvania.
Curtis of Kansas , Whiting of Michigan and
Tate of Georgia was appointed to attend the
funeral of the Into Representative O'Nelllof
Pennsylvania , and then , ut U p , m , as n
further inarlc of respect to tlo memory of
Iho deceased members , the house adjourned.

WASIIIXOTOX , Dec. 4. It Is not often the
public nwalts n president's message with thu
Intense Interest which has been manifested
In tlio document today sent to congress.
The mcssaeo was listened to with close at
tention in both houses , nnd the views of
members on the document nro pertinent nnd
Interesting Just nt this time.
-Speaker Hrcd said : "I dislike to com
ment on the message , because il would not
be seemly to do It in adequate term ! ) . U Is
exceedingly disappointing , both in'mattcr
and manner. It Is largely made up of a
wearisome resume of the reports of his sec
retaries , which tire hardly improved by con
densation. On the Hawaiian question wo
are left as much in the dark ns over , and
must nwait the next steamer just ns wo
Imvo been waiting so long. That part of tho.
mcs.sago which relates to the tarltl Is most
surprising. It nsservatcs that the house
committee In charge of that subject has
formulated plans and devised methods of
taxation which , ns a member of tno com
mittee , I have not even heard proposed.
It is a rather unusual sensation to learn
of the deeds of the committee ,
not in the committee room , but from the
president of the United States. Has that
committee ceased In form to bo composed of
both parties and has It , without even the
formality of u word in open committee. In
formed the president of its determination in
such n way that the president can officially
communicate it to the house ? How ( long
has it been a part of our system that a com
mittee of our Independent branch , and above
all , the committee controlling the purse ,
shall report to congress through the president -
dent ?
"Is this the result of the rumored blend
ing of the appointive with the legislative
power ? It is bad enough to have a tariff bill
made up by a little coterie , but to have it
communicated to the president before it
reaches oven the committee , still less the
house , shows a determination to be moved
by no facts und modified by no nrgumcnts ,
which makes apparent the absurdity of ap
pointing republicans on the ways and means
committee at all. "
Clear , Able nml Forcible.
Mr. Springer of Illinois said : "In refer
ence to the tariff the message is clear and
forcible. In this the message wHl receive
the cordial commendation of every democrat
in the land. In reference to the currency ,
the president very hopefully anticipates that
a survey of the sltuatio'n. after nubile confi
dence is restored , will lead to n permanently
sound currency. The president is evidently
opposed to the repeal of the 10 pur cent tnx
on the circulntton of state banks. In refer
ence to lib wall the president takes the only
course consistent with' international honor
and comity. "
Mr. Holman of Indiana It is an abln and
forcible document. Tno earnest expectations
of economy contrast , strongly with the mes
sages heretofore presented.
Mr. Crcary of Kentucky , Chairman of the
Foreign Affairs Committee It Is an able and
appropriate document. He presents our
foreign affairs , monetary matters and the
tariff with great ability , und I think his rec
ommendations arc generally good.
Foi in.il ami UtiBntlnfiictory.
Mr. Dolliverof Iowa The message is In
most respects formal. In tlio matters of
public interest that uro in dispute the mes
sage lacks any satisfactory expression. In
respect to Hawaii , the president conceals
from congress nil iniormaiion mat is im
portant and socms to know really less about
the situation than Is known to the general
public. As to silver , the president lacks the
conrago to state his views und commits the
whole subject to the policy of delay. On the
question of Issuing bonds to maintain our
currency and to meet the deficit of Insuf
ficient revenues the president's language is
wanting m dcllnltcness and makes no pre
tense of n leadership of public opinion. Ho
seems to have exhausted his power of lead
ership in the midsummer attack on the in-
toiests of silver. The president's views on
the tariff arc well kno\vn nnd hisnrdcnt sup
port of the proposed Wilson bill surprises
nobody.
Chairman Wilson of the Ways nnd Means
Committee U ho president's' message is alt
right.
Mr. Cobb of Missouri I am heartily In
accord with the measure und Its conclusions.
Mr. Traccy of Now York 1 am satisfied
with it. It is a good message.
Tlin Mensnp.o In u Nutshell ,
Mr. Gear of Iowa , Member of tlio Ways
and Means Committee The president says
ho will restore Lilluoknluni ; gives the ma
jority of the ways and means committee
away on the income tax , and agrees with
Hancock that the tariff is n local issue nnd
asks the people not to Kick.
Mr. Hynum of Indiana , Member of the
Ways and Means Committee It Is a very
concise , but clear statement of the multi
tude of questions congress will bo called
upon to consider.
Mr. I'icklcr of South Dakota The asser
tion of the president that there are great
and gigantic frauds in connection with the
pension rolls , and a largo number of fraudu
lent pensioners upon the rolls , is wholly un
substantiated by facta.
Mr. Boutelloof Maine It is the first ex
ecutive document which directly impugned
and charged uiulfc.itanco in office and prac
tically treason upon n United States minis
ter , ntalnst whom nothing was charged by
tlio administration up to the time his res
ignation was accepted. The people of Lon
don may boawaroof the policy the president
pursues nnd his authority for making war ,
tearlngxioxVn and putting up governments ,
but wo do not.
lloiuarkably Disappointing.
Mr. Paypo of Now York , Member of the
Ways and Means Committee Tli i message
In a remarkably disappointing document.
On important matters it gives little informa
tion. On Hawaiian affairs It gives us no In
formation , Ills announcement of the In
ternal revenue feature of the plans of the
ways und means committee Is astounding ,
This is the first information the minority
member * have Pad that any conclusion had
been reached. If reports are cprrcct the
pcopluW London are Informed tin this Im
portant matter much e-jrlicr tnan members
of the committee. The question now scorns
to bo whether nil legislation must originate
at the whi'.o house.
Mr. D.I lie U of Pennsrlvauh , Member of
the Ways and Means Committee The presi
dent sajs that "after u full discussion our
countrymen have spoken ' In favor
of tariff reform , and Imvo conhded
the work of the accomplishment of
it to the hands of these who are
solemnlv pledged lo it. " I infer thnt Dy the
latter expression the president mcutii , the
majority of the ways and means committee ,
nnd by "tariff reform. " the propoiedlncngrel
bill given to the press a week ago.It would
scum the president has not yet heard the
news from New York , Pennsylvania , Ohio ,
low-i and Massachusetts. When he refers
to the reduction of tariff charges on thu nec
essaries of lift ) , I suppose no means cham
pagne ana brandy. The fact that the presi.
dent reasserts the time-worn nnd so nlten ,
and , under ttic opfratbn of the Mcivlulcy
law , so emphatically disproved assertion.
that n protective tarlff.irtcrx'nscs the cost uf
poods to the eustonitu- shows what n hUc-
bound theorist the president is , and how
facts weigh nothing wllli'n tariff reformer.
On the whole , ho tnus bca most devoted nd.
mlrcr of the prcsldcnt.who can find In the
message nny strengthening of the demo
cratic position on the tnritt question ,
Mr. Hepburn of Idwa The message
Is h business paper , dcvolcd mainly to the
business of condensing the statements nnd
recommendations ot the secretaries. Neces
sarily it Is tedious nnd dronry. Ho favors
tariff reform , but whether It Is tariff reform
of the variety ot 18$8 or 1SOJ Is Itrft In doubt.
I don't thluk the message will add to the
president's fnmo or harmonize the conten
tions In his party.
lletlrr fitted for London.
Senator Mnndorsorf The message , ns n
digest or syllabus of the reports of cabinet
officers , Is valuable. ' As n communication
recommending tn congress such measures
as tno president shall deem necessary and
expedient , it Is nf llttlo value. Its recom
mendations of legislative action by passage
of laws are weakened by Its statements of
dlDlcuitlcs that stand In the wny of their
enactment. It suggests that wo should con
tinue the building up of n thorough nnd effi
cient navy , und says that the depleted con
dition of the treasury prevents an appropria
tion to continue new work. It suggests the
necessity for a lasting and comprehen
sive financial plan , but olTors none
and proposes nrnltlng policy , nnd
recommends the dead rot of masterly inac
tivity. It offers lie method by which the
stifled Industries of the country shall bo reinvigorated -
invigorated , but holds out renewed threats
of legislation to bo known as tariff reform
that will close more mills , put out the fires
of more furnaces , deaden the sounds of pro
ductions In moro factories , and Increase the
great army of the suffering unemployed. In
recommending an Income tax it offer ; n
premium upon dishonesty and makes a bid
for perjury. The propositions of the message
ns to Internal policy nro most miajhiovous.
Its suggestions ns to the course to bo pur
sued by the great republic In its intercourse
with foreign powers nrc exasperating. It
certainly was most lilting that the message
with its abandonment of Americanism in In
ternal commerce , its substitution of the
essence of free trndo for protection , its
striking of the stars and bars in foreign
lands , and Its general surrender to Kngland
should have been published this morning In
London before it wna made public in Wash
ington. It Is better fitted to the smoky at
mosphere of the great city on the Thames
than the clear sunshine of the capital on
the Potomac. The American people will con
demn It. The English will applaud it.
Should HP VV'cll Hccelvcil.
Senator Voorhccs In the main the mes
sage is a sound , strong document. 1 have
not examined It critically and cannot go into
details. I think itvill bo well received by
the country.
Senator McPhcrson It is excellent all the
wny through. I WHS especially welt pleased
with the recommonna'tions with regard to
the general finances' nnd.the tariff and as to
the principles involved In the tnriff"bill.
Senator Murphy Itiis'a good message.
Senator Palmer The president goes moro
into detail than usual 'wHh him. The sug
gestions are generally m the line of demo
cratic thought. I have no especial objection
to what he says regarding ! pensions , but I
have an Idea that ( its impressions are wide
of the mark concerning1 fraudulent pensions.
I do not know how it is. among the colored
fex-soldiers of the south , but my information
leads me to believe thatr in the north not 2
per cent of the penslons Jirp fraudulent.
Xotliliic StrlblutMn It. '
Senator ICylo There jvas nothing striking
in the messagCfithbugh/it contained some
good points. I was pleased with his recom
mendations for an incotuo. tax , but whiit ho
said about Hawaii and Ills recommendation
concerning the Issuance of bonds were not to
my liking.'v
Senator Morrlll The presldcnt'sicndorso'
incut of a tariff bill pot yet acted on by the
committcb was vcry'unexpected and remark
able.
Senator Hoar Tno message treats the
most.impbrtant questions feebly nnd briefly.
The imputation of the president concerning
civil service reform , to the effect that the
law wus enacted because of the fear of puo-
llc opinion , and not because of the convic
tions of the legislators who enacted it , is
without precedent. 'JJhls reflection comes
with nn ill grace Irom a president whoso ap
pointment ot Van Aleii has been such an of
fense to the country's sense of decency. The
message is further remarkable in stating the
report of the ways a.nd ceans committee of
the house before "the jcommitteo has deter
mined upon it. Such nj course is a breach of
the privileges of the public , and would not
have been tolorntcd in Other times.
Senator Mitchell of Oregon The Wilson
bill the president endorses , and he strikes a
blow at the industries of the Pacific coast.
Mostly Quite llnnnlem.
Senator Lodge The most ot the message
was taken up with perfectly harmless
routine business. Tlio clause about Hawaii
appears to announce the extraordinary doc
trine that it is our duty to overturn n gov
ernment wo have recognized in order to
recognize another go cuunent. On this
theory wo ought to instantly restore Texas
to Mexico , nnd Franco which entered into
an alliance with us during the revolution ,
ought now to restore us , by force if neces
sary , to England. Thu statement In regard
to the tariff contains ono very Interesting
clause. This morning , it was understood
that the democratic members of the ways

DENVER , Dec. 4. A copy of the pronuncla-
mcnto of the Mexican revolutionists was re
ceived nt the headquarterj of the Depart
ment of the Military of Colorado today. It
is as follows :
"MCMCAX Soi.uir.us Today wo direct our
selves to you , in confidence that wo arc
going to talk with our own brothers. We are
sons of the same mother , ours is one flag ,
one territory ; wo speak the same language
and sccic the same aggrandisement of the
country and oar mutual felicity. Why ,
then , do wo meet with arms in
hands , destroy Ing one another ? Because the
tyrants of the village are cunplng enough
to deceive us. The army In the democratic
countries Is composed of free men , also citi
zens who love their country , so they may de
fend it of as many dangers as may threaten
it. But you do not grasp arms of your own
will. You lived in trnuqullity in your town
by the sldo of your mother nnd brothers ;
you had n wife that took care of you and
your children ; that greeted jou with ca
resses. From night until morning you were
confined in jail and nftcrwunts-by a subor
dinate official taken to n room where you
are registered and In the name of your coun
try deprived of your liberty.
"Your mother and.brothcrs remain aban
doned , your wife and children have no pro
tection , and sluco then you live In a square ,
piled together like stubble and guarded like
cattle.
"Is this the condition of free men that
subject themselves to military discipline ?
Answer with your.hands on your hearts. No I
A thousand times , no I Does the country
demand these sacrifices for us ? Ho de
prives you of your llbert.v ; ho would deprive
you of the right to live in tranquillty by the
side of your family. It is not the country ,
but Porlirio Diaz , that bad Mexican who has
mortgaged Mexico in foreign markets , that
cursed son -who murders his brothers and de
bases them.
"You then grasp the arms to defend a"
despicable tyrant ; but not to save the coun
try from any danger. Wo moot face to face
because you attempt to defend an injustice.
You are the strength sustained by a tyrant
that tortures the country to pay you with
wretched , wages. Wo are the strength of
right , we think what wo do ; nobody pays us
to grasp the arms. The wicked and the
lackeys give us the name of 'bandits , ' but
our conscience gives us the name of patriots.
We want to live free .or die , but not to bo
slaves.
"Wo have road a book that was written
with the blood of our forefathers. There wo
arc shown to elect our general ofllcers by
means of frco suffrage , there wo are shown
to think as citizens and wo are elevated to
the category of freemen. That book is named
thp political constitution of It&T. If tbo
tyrant who pays you to. murder us would
jovorn by that law wo should llvo In trun-
juu iicuuu , cuiuv.iuiiK uur jum uuu i.umg

committed every day ; wo perceive the
danger in which the country is bound , ana
we have not hesitated one moment to aban-
lon overytliingnnd have rushed in the battle

> cople.
"Mexican soldiers , if you want to avoid

'

our wives , widows and our sons
made orphans to lot a tyrant on- '
oy and distribute the spoils of the
lation. Wo. , the revolutionists , dofeiut a
n-ineiple and seek the salvation of the coun

slaves and you seek his aggrandizement.
Down with the tyrants I Hurrah for tlio

"About two leagues from the place of
siege , the soldiers and chiefs of the law
could have exterminated the revolutionists.
Those events having passed they should
Imvo followed usand succeeding in the arrest
they should have gene to a competent
authority that wu might bo tried according
to law.

" \Vo have scon in the official papers , which
give the number of the dead . ,10 bo forty of
the revolutionists which Is incorrect and
the same time a deceit.
"In the battle of San to Tomas only twenty-
three died , Now the result , according to
the list we have before us , there wcro
shot thirty-one men. Of this number pos
sibly live or six might bo guilty of revolu

is to the contrary , as each day wo find our-
bnlvcs moro offended and wo do not hesitate

Ellin. Pa. , Dec. 4. Edward CaJy , n mo-
chanlo of this city , whllo suffering from n
morphine debauch , planned the murder ot
his entire family today , and but for the op
portune arrival of his wife , whoso grief
seemed to disarm him , ho would have suc
ceeded.
Cndy last evening gave his son Walter n
heavy iloso of morphine and kept his horrid
secret until his wlfn detected his crime. All
night long ho tore through the house weep
ing for his boy and in terms expressive of
fear of public exposure. Early this mornlug
ho succeeded In borrowing a revolver from
an unsuspecting neighbor. Then getting
his wife out of the house for a moment be
gan the revolting work of mu'-doring his in
nocent children.
When his baby Hazel saw the revolver she
threatened to tell her mamma , but desisted
under a threat. Cady first dispatched llttlo
Bertha , who was too much engrossed by her
school studies to observe her father's ac
tions. He then sent a ball through Walter's
brain us he lay on the bed suffering from the
poison he had given' a few hours prior.
Cady turned to kill the oldest son , a
lad of 10 years , .but the latter ran out and
escaped the deadly missile , and called to
his mother. Baby Hazel was the next
victim to bo added to the pyre , but Mrs.
Cady's distracted cries caused the murderer
to pause long enough to enable her to snatch
the child from the verge of the orravo. Cady
glared a moment nt hh wife , and then seem
ing to relent , turned and fired n ball through
his own disordered brain. The 'tragedy was
the bloodiest and. most revolting in the
criminal annals of tills city. It Is feared
Mrs. Caoy will lose her reason. Cady was
a man of 42 and had"been married eleven

WASHINGTON , Dee 4. Tha president's mes
sage delivered to congress today was as fol
lows :
To TIIF. Coxonn s OF Tiii : Uxirr.n STATED :
The constitutional duty which requires
the president from time to time to give to
the conx'rcss information of ttio state of the
union , nnd icconiincnd to Its consideration
such matters as ho shall judge necessary , Is
fittingly entered upon by commending to the
congress a careful consideration of the de
tailed statements and well supported recom
mendations contained in the reports of de
partments who are chiefly charged with thu
executive work of the government. In an
effort tonbridco thiscomnumicaiion ns much
as is consistent with its uurposn , 1 shall sup
plement a brief reference to the contents of
tht'so departmental reports by the mention
of such executive huslncHS and incidents as
nro not embraced therein , and by such
recommendations ns appear to bo at this
particular time appropriate. . While our for-
cicn relations have not nt all times during
the past year been entirely fioo from per
plexity , no cribarrassitiK situation remains
that will not yield to the spirit of fairness
and love of Justice which , joined with con
sistent firmness , ctmractorlzo a truly Ameri
can foreign policy.
My predecessor having accepted the offlco
of arbitrator of the long' standing
missions boundary dispute , tendered to the
president by the Argentine Republic and
Brazil , it-has boon my utrreeablo duty to re
ceive the special envoys commissioned by
thesu states to lay before mo evidence and
arguments in behalf of tholr respective
governments.
Attitude In Urn7.ll. "
The outbreak of domestic ) hostilities in the
republic of Brazil founl the United States
alert to watch the intcrostsof our citizens in
that country , with which wo carry on im
portant commerce. Several vessels of our
new navy are now , and for some timn have
been , .stationed ut Klo do Janeiro. The
struggle being between the established
( lovernmcnt , uhlch controls the machinery
of administration nnd with which wo main
tain friendly relations , and certain officers
of tha navy employing the vessels of their
command in i.n attack upnn tno national
capital and chlof sea port , and lacking as It
does the elements of divided administration ,
1 have failed to sco that tlio insurgents can
reasonably claim recognition us belliger
ents. Thus , the position of our government
has been that of tin attentive but impartial
observer of the unfortunate conflict. Em-
phasUlng our fixed policy of impartl.il
neutrality m tuch a condition of
affairs as now exists 1 deemed It
necessary to disavow , in a manner
not to bo misundcfstoo 1 , the .un-
autnorh'cd action of our 1 ito naval com
mander in these waters in Diluting the ro-
voltcd Brazilian admiral , being indl.spo.scd to
countenance an act calculated to give gratu-
Ittlits sanction to the local Insurrection.
Concerning ? tlin C'lillinn UoiiiiiiUHlon.
The convention between' our government
and Chill , having for its object the settle
ment imd ndjusimont of the demands of tlio
two countries against cnch other , has been
made effective by the organization uf the
claims commission pi ovlded for , Tlio two
governments failing to nsreo upon the thlr4
member of the commission , the good otticos
nf the president of thu Swlus ronublUwcro
Involtrd. ns provided in the treaty , and the
selection of the Swiss roprcseiitatlvu hi this
country to complete the organisation ivas
gratifying to the United Suites and Chili.
The vexatious question ofho-callcd legation
asylum for offenders against the state imd
its laws was presented an'tw In Chill by the
unauthorized action uf the late United
States minister In receiving in hi.s ofilciil
residence two pnrtoris whii had failed hi un
attempt nt revolution nn I against whom
criminal charges woi'J pznd'cif' growing out
of n former ub.irUvo dlsturtuiu'o.
The doctrine of asylum , an uppllu.l to tliU
case , Is not sanctioned by the bast prcL-cJont
nnd when allowed tends to cncourago
sedition und strlfn. Under no cir.Mi
can the representatives or thfa go
bo permitted , under the iUlufluoJ ) llctioj
of extraterritoriality , to interrupt the administration

countries to which they are urcroaitod , A
temperate demand bavin ; Leon made by the
Chilian government for the correction of
the conduct hi the instance mentioned thu
mli.istcr was instructed no longer to htirbor
offenders.
Unary nnd Ilio Ulilnrkii ,
The legislation of lastyear , linown as tlin
Geary law. requiring the ivglstratlou of till
Chlnufio laborers entitled to residence In the
United Stutcs und the deportation of nil not
complying with the provision of the act
witldn t'lo tlmo prescribed , met with mucti
opposition from Chinamen fti tills country.
Acting upon the advlco of eminent , counsel
that the law was unconMilutional the in-cut
mass of Chinese laborers , pending judicial
Inquiry us to its validity , in guol faith de
clined to apply for the certificates required
by Its provisions. A li > t upon proceeding
by habeas corpus was brought before thu
supreme court and un May IS , lS'Ji. ; decision
was made by that tribun.il sustaining the
law ,
U U believed thatundcr the recent amend

tration the Chinese laborers thcioto entitled
who desire to reside in this country will now
nvult Uiemaolves of thu renewed privilege
thus nffordod of establishing by lawful
procedure their right to romam und that
thereby the necessity ot enforced deporta

It has devolved upon thu United States
