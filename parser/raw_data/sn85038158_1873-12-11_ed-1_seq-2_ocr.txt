ABSTRACT
OF THE
President's Message.
Owinpr to the unusual lenjrlh of
the President's Message, and believ
ing that an intelligent synopsis of its
contents will be more acceptable to
the majority of our readers than the
entire document, we have concluded
to condense its substance into ' the
space.of three or four columns, in
stead of occupying our whole space,
to the exclusion of other matter.
The opening paragraph is. worthy
of being given in' fulL The Presi
dent says:
The year that lias passed since the
submission of my last Message to
Congress has, especially the latter
part of it, been an eventful one to the
country. In the midst of great Na
tional prosperity a financial crisis has
occurred that has brought : low for
tunes of gigantic proportions; politi
cal partisanship has almost ceased to
exist, especially in the agricultural
regions, and finally the capture upon
the high seas of a vessel bearing om
flag has for a time threatened tlw
most serious consequences, and has
agitated the public mind from one
end of the country to the other; but
this happily is now in the course of
satisfactory adjustment, honorable to
both Nations concerned. The rela
tions of the United States, however,
with most of the other Nations, con
tiuue to be friendly and cordial.
VIENNA EXPOSITION.
The President next refers to the
Vienna Exposition, and says that the
object in view in sending Commiss
ioners on the part of the U. States,
as authorized by Congress, is believ
ed to have been attained. A repre
sentative of our Patent Office attend
ed the conference held at Vienna, in
regard to inventions, whose report
will be submitted to Congress.
CHINA.
Tho Emperor of China, on attain
ing his majority, received the repre
sentatives of the Western powers in
person, and some slight advance hap
been made towards suppressing the
Chinese Coolie trade. The President
suggests to Congress to inquire
whether more legislation is needed.
GENEVA ARBITRATION.
The British Government paid the
award of fifteen and a half millions to
our Government a few days before it
was due. The amount has been in
vested in a five per cent registered
bond of the United States for $15,-
500,000, which is now held by the
Secretary of State, subject to the fu
ture disposition of Congress.
The President renews his recom
mendation for a commission to deter
mine the amounts due to owners of
vessels captured by the rebel cruisers
Alabama and Shenandoah, to an ex
tent not to exceed- the amount of the
award.
NORTHWEST BOUNDARY.
The northwest water boundary be
tween the U.; States and Great Brit
ain has been completed in accordance
with the decision of the Emperor of
Germany, and the work of marking
the boundary line west of the Lake of
the Woods has been completed for
497 miles west of the lake, leaving
about 350 miles to be surveyed, which
will be finished next season.
BRITISH CLAIMS.
"The Commissioners organized un
der provisions of the Treaty of Wash
ington for the settlement and deter
mining of the claims of citizens of
either power against the other, aris
ing: out of acts committed against
tbeir persons or property during the
period between April 13," 1861, and
April 9, 1SG5, made its final award on
the 25th day of September last. It
was awarded that the Government o'
the United States should pay to the
Government of Her Britannic Majes
ty withm twelve months from the
date of award, the sum of $1,929,819
in gold."
All other claims of British subjects
against the U. S. were disallowed,
amounting to about $93,000,000.
The commission also disallowed all
claims of the U. States against Gt
Britain, which were referred to it
An appropriation is recommended to
pay the award to Gt. Britain.
The President tendered the thanks
of our Government to the Govern
ment of Italy for the valuable ser
vices of Count Conti as the third
member of the commission.
The President recommends the ap
pointment of three judges to deter
mine all claims of aliens against the
U. States for damages to persons or
property, after the close of the rebel
lion. :
ACHEEN.
The U. S. officers in the vicinity of
Acheen have been instructed to ob
serve strict neutrality between that
country and the Netherlands, which
are now at war.
MEXICO.
The Mexican joint commission has
resumed business, and the British
Minister at Washington has consent
ed to act as umpire in all cases of
dispute between the arbitrators of
the U. S. and Mexico.
VENEZUELA.
The Venezuelan government has
not yet fulfilled its obligations to the
U. S. under the award of the joint
commission of 18GG. but in view of
the embarrassments of that govern
ment, the expediency of further for
bearance on our part ia suggested.
TURKEY AND EGYPT.
A change has recently been made
by these governments in the judicial
powers of foreign consuls, which the
President refers to Congress for their
;i8sent or disapproval.
SAN DOMINGO.
.The President says: 'T transmit
here for the consideration and deter
mination of Congress an application
the Republic of Santo Domingo to
uus Government to exercise a pro
tectorate over that Republic."
He makes no recommendation as
what shall bo done with the appli
cation.
TREATIES.
"Since the adjournment of Con
gress the following treaties with for
jgn powers have been proclaimed: A
.Naturalization vJonvention witn uen-
mark; a Convention, with Mexico for
renewing the Claims Commission; a
Convention of friendship, commerce
and extradition with tlio Orange Free
States, and a Naturalization Conven
tion with Ecuador."
NATIONALITY.
The President invites the earnest
attention of Congress to the existing
laws of the United States respecting
expatriation and the eligibility of na
tionality by individuals.
He thinks further legislation is
needed, and in conclusion says:
"I invite Congress to mark out and
define when and how expatriation can
be accomplished; to regulate by law
the condition of American - women
marrying foreigners; to fix the status
of children born in a foreign country
of American parents residing more or
less permanently abroad, and to fix
rules for determining such other kin
dred points as may seem best to Congress."
SPAIN AND THE CUBAN DIFFICULTY.
i The President says he transmitted
to the Spanish Government the joint
resolution ; of Congress passed the
3d of March last, congratulating
Spain on the adoption of a Republi
can form of Government He then
proceeds as follows:
"The existence of this new Republic
was inaugurated by striking the fet
ters from slaves in Porto Rico. This
beneficent measure was followed by
the release of several thousand per
sons illegally sold an slaves in Cuba.
"Next, the Captain General of that
colony was deprived of the power to
set aside trie orders oi his superiors
it Madrid, which had pertained to
the office since 1825. The sequest
ered estates of American citizens,
which had been the cause of long and
frequent correspondence, were order
ed to be restored to their owners.
All these liberal steps were taken in
the face of opposition, directed by the
reactionary slaveholders of Havana,
;vho are vainly striving to stay the
uarch of ideas which have terminated
slavery in Christendom, Cuba only
excepted. ' Unhappily, however, this
baneful influence has thus far suc-
-eeded in defeating the efforts of
dl liberal minded men in Spain to
abolish slavery in Cuba, and in pre
venting the promised reform in that
sland. The struggle for political
supremacy continues. .
"The pro-slavery aristocracy of
Cuba is gradually arraying itself in
more and more open hostility and
lefiance of the home Government,
while it still maintains a . political
connection with the Republic in
the Peninsula, and although usurp
ing and defying the authority of the
'iome Government, whenever such
usurpation or defiance tends in the
direction of oppression, or of the
maintenance of pro-slavery abuses,
it is still a power in Madrid, and
recognized by the Government. Thus
an element more dangerous to con
tinued colonial relations between Cu
Sa and Spain than that which inspired
the insurection at Tara; an element
opposed to granting any relief from
nisrule and abuse, with no aspiration
after freedom, commanding no sym
pathies in generous breast, aiming
to rivet still stronger the shackles of
slavery and oppression, has seized
many of the emblems of power in
Oiibo, and under professions of loy
alty to the mother country, isexuinst
mg the resources of the island, and is
doing acts which are at variance with
those principles of justice, of liberal
ity, and of right, which give ' nobility
of character to a Republic. In tha
interest of humanity, of civilization,
and of progress, it is to hi hope 3
that this evil influence may be soon
averted.
"The steamer Virginius was, on
the 2Gth day of September, 1S70,
duly registered at the port of New
York as a part of the commercial ma
rine of the United States. On the
4th of October, 1S70, having received
the certificate of her registry in the
usual legal form, she sailed from the
port of New York, and has not since
been within the territorial jurisdic
tion of the United States. On thp
3 1st day of October last, while sail
ing under the flag of the United
States on the hih seas, she was
forcibly seized by the Spanish gun
boat Tornado, and was carried into
thrt port of San iago de Cuba, where
tnany of her passengers an 1 crew
were inhumanly, and so far at least
as relates to those who were citizens
of tha Unitid States, were, without
iu3 process of law, put to death. It
is a well established principle assert
ed by the United States from the be
ginning of their National independ
ence, recognized oy ureat xsntam
and other maritime powers, and
stated by the Senate in a resolution
passed unanimously on the 16th of
June, 1858, that American vessels on
the high seas in time of peace, bear-
iug the American flag, remain under
the jurisdiction of the country to
which they belong, and, therefore,
any visitation, molestation or deten-
ti in of such vessel by for.ie, on pait
of a foreign po m r, is in derogation of
the sovereignty of the United States.
"In accordance with this principle
the restoration of the Virginius and
the surrender of the suivivors of her
passengers and crew, and a due rep
aration to the flag and the punish
ment of tie authorities who had
been guilty of the illegal acts of vio
lence, were demanded. The Spanish
Government has recognized the jus
tice of the demand, and has arranged
for the immediate delivery of the ves
sel and for the surrender of the sur
vivors of the passengers and crew,
nd for a salute to the flag, and for
proceedings looking to the punish
ment of those who m iy be proved to
have been guilty of illegul acts of
violence toward the' citizens of the
United States, and also toward in
demnifying those who may be shown
to be entitled to indemnity. A copy
of a protocol of a conference between
the Secretary of State and th6 Span
ish Minister, in which the terms of
this arrangement were agreed to,
will be transmitted herewith. The
correspondence on this subject with
the Legation of the United States, is
in cipher and by cable, and needs the
verification of the actual text of the
correspondence.
It lias seemed to me to be due to
the importance of tha case not to sub
mit this correspond ance until the ac
curate text can be received by m uL
It is expected shortly, and will be
submitted wheD received. In taking
leave of this subject for the present,
I wish to renew the expression of my
conviction that the existence of African
slavery in Cuba is a principal cause of
tiie lamentable condition oi the island.
I do not doubt that Congress shares
with me the hope that it will soon be
made to disappear, and that peace
and prosperity may follow its abo
lition. The embargoing of American es
tates in Cuba; cruelty to American
citizens detected in no act of hostili
ty to the Spanish Government; the
murdering of prisoners taken with
aims in their hands, and, finally, the
cj.pture upon the Ligh seas of a ves
sel sailing under the United States
flag and bearing the United States
t-pwies
to
of
registry, has culminated in an "out
burst of indignation that has seemed
for a time to threaten war. Pending
negotations - between the United
States and tho Government of Spain,
on the subject of this capture, I have
authorized the Secretary of the Na
vy to put our navy on a war footing
to tho extent at least of the entire
annual appropriation for that branch
of the service, trusting to Congress
and the public opinion of the Ameri
can people to justify my action." . .
CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENTS.
The President recommends an
amendment to the Constitution to
provide a better mode of electing the
President and Vice President; also
an amendment to authorize the Presi
dent to approve so - much of any
law. of Congress as his judgment
may dictate, without approving the
whole, and to provide that there shall
be no legislation by Congress during
the last 24 hours of any session, except
on vetoes. Also an amendment re
stricting legislation during any extra
session of Congress to such subjects
as the President may bring before
that body in writing.
TREASURY DEPARTMENT.
The President says:
"The receipts of the Government
from all sonrces for the last fiscal
year were $333,738,204, and expen
ditures on all accounts zVJV,6b,Zi:),
thus showing an excess of receipts
over expenditures of $43,392,959,
but it is not probable that this favor
able exhibit will be shown for the
present fiscal 'year."
He regards it as doubtful whether
the receipts will meet the expendi
tures, without the strictest economy,
and recommends that this economy
be observed wherever practicable. .
THE FINANCIAL PANIC.
On this important topic we print
the President's " clear and common
sense views in full, as no abstract
can do them justice: ' '
"The revenues have materially fall
en off for the past five months of the
present fiscal year, from what :they
were expected to produce, owing to
the general panic now ' prevailing,
which commenced about the middle
of September last The full effect f
this , disaster if it .'should not
prove to , be , a blessing in
disguise, is yet to be demonstrat
ed. In either event it is your duty
to heed the lesson and ' provide by
wise and well considered legislation
as tar as it lies in your power against
its recourrence, and to take advan
tage of all benefits that may have ac
crued. My own judgment is, that
however much individuals have suf
fered, one long step has been taken
toward specie payments; that we
can never have permanent prosperity
ii til a specie basis is reached, an
that a specie basis can not be reached
and maintained until our exports, ex
clusive of gold, pay for our imports,
interest due abroad and other specie
obligations so nearly as to leave an
appreciable accumulation of the
precious metals in the country from
the products of our mines. The de
velopment of - mines of precious
metals during the past year, and the
prospective development of them for
y '&T3 to comf, are gratifying in their
results. Could but one ' half . of the
gold extracted from the mines be re
tained at home, our advance towards
specie payments woidd be rapi l.
"To increase our experts sufficient
currency is raquired to keep all the
industries of the country em; 1 ved;
without this, nutional as well as this
individual bankruptcy must ensu.
Undue inflition on the other hand,
while it might give temporary relief,
would only lead to inflation of prices,
the impossibility of competing in onr
markets for the produ-t? of horn"!
skill and lab r, and the repeated re
newals of present experiences. Elas
ticity in our circulating medium,
therefore, and just enough of it to
transact the legitimate business of
the conntry and to keep the indus
tries employed, is what is most nee l
el. The exact medium is specie,
the recognizad medium of exchange
the world over. That attained, we shall
have a currency of an exact degree of
elasticity. If there ba too much of
it for the legitimate purposes of trade
and commerce it will flow out of the
country if too little, tho reverse will
result To hold what we have, and
to appreciate our currency to that
standard, is a problem deserving of
the most serious consideration of
Congress.
"The experience of the pr?sent
panic has proven that the currency of
the country, based as it is on the
credit of the country, is the best that
has ever been devised. Usually in
times of such trials currency has be
come worthless, or so much depre
ciated in value as to innate the val
ues of all tuo necessaries of lire, as
compared with the currency. Every
one holding it has been willing to dis
pose of it on any terms, jnow we
witness the reverse; holders of cur
rency noard it as tney did gold m
former experiences of a like nature.
"It is p itent to the most casual
observer that much more currency,
or money, is required to transact the
legitimate trade of the country dur
ing the fall and winter months, when
the vast crops are being moved, than
during the balance of the year.
With our present system the amount
in the country remains the same
throughout the entire year, resulting
m an accumulation of all surplus cap
it d of the country, at a few centres,
whrn not employe 1 in the moving of
cr ps, tempte I there by fie offer of
interest on call loans. Interest be
ing paid on this surplus capital, it
must earn tins interest paid, witn a
profit Being subject to call, it can
not be loaned, or only in part, at best,
to the merchant or manufacturer for a
fixed term. Hence, no matter how
much currency there might be in the
country, it will be absorbed, prices
keeping1 pace with the volume, and
panics, stringency and disaster would
ever be recurring with the autumn.
"Elasticity in our money system,
therefore, is the object to be obtained
first, and next to thnt, as far as pos
fible, a prevention of the use of other
people's money in stock and other
of speculation. To prevent
tiie latter, it seems to me that one
great step would be taken by prohib
iting tho National banks from paying
interest on deposits, by requiring
them to hold their reserves in their
own vaults, and by forcing tuem in
to resumption, though it would be
only in legal tender notes. For this
purpose I would suggest the estab
lishment of clearing houses for your
consideration. To secure the former
many plans have been suggested,
moat, if not all, of which look to me
like inflation on the one hand, or
compelling Government on the other,
pay interest, without correspond
ing benefits, upon tho surplus funds
the country during the seasons
when otherwise unemployed. I
submit for your consideration wheth
er this difficulty might not be over
Come by authorizing the Se6retary of
!
to
the Treasury to issue at any time,
to National banks of issue, any
amount of their notes below a fixed
percentage of their issue, say forty
per cent, upon the banks depositing
with the Treasurer of the United
States an smount t of Government
bonds equal to the amount of notes
demanded; the bank to forfeit to the
viovernment say four per cent of !
the interest accruing on the bonds
so pledged during the time that they
remain with the Treasury as security
for the increased circulation, the
bonds so pledged to be redeemable
by the banks at their pleasure, either
in whole or in part, by returning their
own bills for cancellation to an
amount equal to the face of the
bonds withdrawn. " " r
"I would rather suggest for your
consideration, the propriety of au
thorizing National banks to diminish
their standing issue at pleasure by
returning for cancellation their own
bills, and withdrawing so many Unit
ed States bonds as are pledged for
the bills returned. . In view of the
great actual contraction that has
taken place in the currency, and the
comparative contraction constantly
going on, the increase of population,
the increase of nmnufactures, and all
the industries, I do not believe that
there is too much of it now for the
dullest period of the year. Indeed,
if clearing houses should be estab
lished, thus forcing redemption, it is a
question for consideration whether
banking should be made free; retain
ing all safe guards now required to
secure bill-holders. In any modifica
tion of the present laws regulating
National banks, and as a further step
toward preparing for resumption 'of
specie payments, I invite your atten
tion to the consideration of the pro
priety of exacting from them the re
tention as a part of their reserve,, of
either the whole or a part of the gold
interest accruing upon the bonds
pledged as security for their issue.
I have not reflected enough on the
bearing this might have in producing
a scarcity of coin with which to pay
duties on imports, to give it my pos
itive recommendation, but your atten
tion is invited to the subject. Dur
ing the last four years the currency
hns been contracted directly by the
withdrawal of three per cent, certifi
cates, compound interest notes and
seven-thirty bonds outstanding on
the 4th of March, 18G9, all of which
took the place of legal tenders in the
bank reserves, to the extent of $63,
000,000. "During the same period there has
been a much larger comparative con
traction of the currency. The pop
ulation of the country has increased,
more '' than twenty-five thousand
miles of railroad have been built, re
qnring the active use of capital to
operate them. Millions of acres of
land have been opened to culti
vation, requiring capital to move the
products. Manufactories have - mul
tiplied beyond all precedent in the
same period of time, requiring capit
al weekly for the payment . of wages,
and for the purchase of material; and
probably the largest part of all the
comparative contraction arises from
the organization of free labor in the
So it'j. " Now, every laborer there re
ceives his wages, and for want of
savings banks the greater part of such
wages is carried in the pocket-book
or hoarded until required for use.
"These suggestions are thrown out
for j'our consideration, without any
reommendation that they shall be
adopted literally, but hoping that the
bjst m-jthod may be arrived at to se
cure such an elasticity of the curren
cy as will keep employed all the ir-dn-itries
of the country, ari l prevent
su.;h an inflation as will put off in
djlinituly tho resumption of sp-.cie
payments, aa object to be devoutly
wished for by all, and none more earn
estly than the class of people most
directly interested those who earn
their bread by the swe it of their
brow. The decision of Congress on
this subject will have the hearty sup
p jtI of the Executive.
.
REVIVAL IN SHIPBUILDING.
The President says the increase' of
this branch of American industry has
been very gratifying the past year,
amounting to about 3 per cent, over
the previous year. He thinks this
rate of increase will be maintained
and even surpassed in the future.
CHEAP TRANSPORTATION.
This important subject is again
recommended to the attention of Con
gress, and the President suggests
that it wou'd be good poliey for tho
Government to agree to keep in nav
igable condition the Hudson river,
the St. Clair Flats and the Illinois
and Mississippi rivers, provided the
States of New York and Illinois will
agree to enlarge the Erie and Lake
Michigan and Illinois river canals, so
as to admit of tho passage of large
vessels.
EXPLORATION OF THE AMAZON.
The President recommends a small
appropriation for an exploration of
the Amazon river, with the view of
extending our commerce in that quar
THE ARMY.
The proper armament of our sea
coast defences, and the reopening of
promotion in the staff corps of the
army, especially in tho medical and
ordinance departments, are specially
recommended to the attention of
Congress, in connection with the re
port of the Secretary of War.
THE NAVY.
The President says our navy has
been reduced by the sale of some old
vessels during the past year, but this
has been more than compensated by
the repair of six wooden ships, and
the completion of the 8 new sloops of
war authorized by the last Congress.
All our available naval force has been
recently put in readiness for active
service, iu view of the possible emer
gency arising for their employment
in defending our national honor.
POST OFFICE DEPARTMENT.
The postal revenue for the year
ending June 30, 1873, was $22,996,
791 57; expenditures, $29,084,995 67.
Increase' of revenue over 1872, $1,-
081,315 20; increase of expenditures,
$246,573 36. Total number of post-
offices 33,244; an increase of 1,381.
The President approves the recom
mendation of the Postmaster General
for postal savings depositories, postal
telegraph lines,' and other sugges
tions of that officer, in regard to sal
aries of postmasters, free delivery of
mail matter, prepayment of newspa
per postage, &c. &.c.
UTAH.
The attention of Congress is called
the necessity of some new Law for
obtaining jurors for the U. S. District
Courts in Utah, and prohibiting the
Probate Courts in that territory from
assuming jurisdiction in questions of
land titles, criminal cases,-, writs of
injunction, &c. Under the existing
state of things, the President say 8
that "property is left without protec
tion by the courts, and crimes go unpunished."
THE BANKRUPT LAW.
The President thinks the Bankrupt
law is productive of more evil than
good at this time, and that many ar
guments might be presented for its
entire repeal, but if this is not
thought, advisable, he recommends
that at least the clause allowing cred
itors to force debtors into bankruptcy
should be repealed. ... .:-;r
CLAIMS GROWING OUT OF THE REBELLION.
The attention of Congress is called
to the large number of claims against
the Government, chiefly for losses
during the war, which are accumulat
ing before the Court of Claims, the
Southern Claims Commission, and in
the various departments, and suggests
that some legislation is necessary to
prevent unfounded and unjust de
mands being made upon the Govern
ment by this class of claimants.
INDIAN POLICY.
The policy heretofore adopted in
regard to the Indians has been stead
ily pursued, and the President be
lieves, with beneficiid results. It will
be continued, with such modifica
tions as experience may suggest He
suggests that a Territorial govern
ment shou'd be established in the In
dian Territory, south of Kansas and
west of Arkansas.
PATENT OFFICE.
The necessity of more room to ac
commodate the rapidly growing busi
ness of the Patent Office, is suggest
ed to the consideration of Congress.
PUBLIC LANDS.
The public lands disposed of dur
ing the last fiscal year amennted to
13,039,G06 acre?, being an increase
of 1,1G5,631 acres over the preceding
year. Of the entire amount, 3,793,
612 acres were taken for homesteads,
214,940 acres on military land war
rants, 6,083,536 acres for railroad
grants, 1,626,266 acres were sold for
cash, and the remainder was appro
priated to States as swamp lands, or
for agricultural colleges, common
schoo'3 and seminaries, and internal
improvements. During the year, 30,
488,132 acres of public lands were
surveyed,- making an aggregate of
616,554,895 acres of surveyed lands,
and leaving 1,218,443,505 acres still
un surveyed. '
The President calls attention to
the fact that a large colony of Rus
sians have expressed a desire to emi
grate to this country, if certain con
cessions can be made to enable them
to settle in a compact colony, and
recommends the attention of Congress
to the suggestions of the Secretary
of the Interior on that subject
PENSIONS.
During the last fiscal year the
whole amount paid for pensions was
$29,135,289 62, being $984,050 98
less than the preceding year. Th
following summary is interesting:-
"At the close of the last fiscal year
there were on the pension rolls 99,
804 invalid military pensioners, and
112,088 widows, orphans and depen
dent widows of deceased soldiers,
making a total of that class of 211,
892; 18,266 survivors of the war of
1812 and 5,053 widows of soldiers of
that war, pensioned under act of
Congress of February 14, 1871, mak
ing a total of that class of 23,319;
1,430 invalid navy pensioners and
1,770 widows and orphans and de
pendent relatives of deceased officers,
sailors and marines total navy pen
sioners, 3,200, and a grand total of
pensioners of all classes f 238,411,
showing a net increase during the
last fiscal year of 6,218. During the
last year thenames of 16,405 pen
sioners were added to the rolls and
10,223 names were dropped there
from for various causes. The system
adopted for the detection of frauds
against the Government in the mat
ter of pensions has been productive
pf satisfactory results, but legislation
is needed to provide, if possible,
against the perpetrating of such
frauds in the future."
DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA.
The great improvements made in
the appearance of the city of Wash
ington during the past three years,
t n
Dy paving, sewerage, &c. are com
mended by the President, and Con
gress is advised to adopt a liberd
policy toward the District authorities,
and to aid in defraying the expenses
of these improvements. The estab
lishment in the District of an institu
tion of learning or university of the
highest class, by the donation of
lands, is also suggested to Congress.
CIVIL SERVICE REFORM.
The President suggests that a spec
ial committee of Congress confer
with the Civil Board during the pres
ent session for the purpose of devis
ing rules to be maintained, which
will secure the services of honest and
capable officials, and which will also
protect them in a degree of indepen
dence while in office.
ADMISSION OF COLORADO.
Congress is recommended to admit
Colorado as a State into the Union,
the President believing that her pop
ulation and resources justify her ad
mission. He also recommends Con
gress to donate lands to aid in the
construction of a canal between the
Missouri river and the Rocky Monn
tains, for the purpose of irrigating
the soil, and rendering it productive.
He believes this measure would se
cure a cordon of settlements connect
ing the mountain and mining regions
with the older States, and be a great
public benefit
or
GENERAL AMNESTY, &C.
The President renews his former
recommendation to Congress for a
general amnesty. Ho says: "The
number engoged in the late rebellion
laboring under disabilities is very
small, but enough to keep up a con
stant irritation. No possible danger
can accrue to the Government by re
storing them to eligibility to hold of
fice." ... .
a
The Message concludes as follows:
"I suggest for yonr consideration
the enactment of a law to better se
cure the civil rights which freedom
should secure, but has not effectually
secured, to the enfranchised slave

The Virginius Affair.
The excitement in Cuba is subsid
ing, and the report that the new Gov.
General had resigned proves untrue.
It is now believed the Cubans will
deliver np the Virginius, according to
the term3 of the protocol. It is also
ascertained that all her passengers
and crew, except 53 who were shct
are still ahve, and it is reported that
they have been delivered np to one of
our war vessels, which arrived at
Santiago a few days ago.
Gen. Sickles, our minister to Spain,
has resigned. It js said he would
have been recalled had he not resign
ed, as his recent course has not given
satisfaction to our Government
The House, on Monday, by the de
cisive vote of 153 to 44, refused to
grant belligerent rights to the Cuban
insurrectionists. This is very signi
ficant of the desire for peace.
On the whole, it is tolerably safe
to say, there will be no war about
Cuba.
Congress Las got fairly to work.
A bin to repeal tne "salary grab is
under discussion in the House, and
will probably pass this week. It re
stores the old pay to all officials ex
cept the President and the Supreme
Judges, and provides that all Con
gressmen who have drawn pay at the
increased rate shall refund the excess.
A bill to restore free exchanges to
newspapers, and free circulation in
the county where published, has been
introduced in the House. It ouht
to become a law.
The Constitutional Convention reassem-bli-d
