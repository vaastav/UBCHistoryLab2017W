DES MOINES, Dec. 5—Governor
Geo. W. Clarke recently appointed a
committee to investigate the needs of
agriculture In Iowa. The members
of the committee were John Cownie,
of Des Moines Eugene Secor of For
est City, and F. D. Steen, of West
Liberty. A comprehensive study of
conditions and needs was made by
these men and their report has just
been forwarded to the governor. The,
report follows:

Notwithstanding these many ad
vantages, the agriculture of the state
has needs of very far-reaching char
acter.
The most obvious of these netcs Is
the recasting of the present system
of land tenancy. At present 40 per
cent of the farms of the state are oc
cupied by tenants. Most of the
leases run for but one year a few
years. This system of short term ten
ancy is bad for the landlord, worse
for the tenant, and worst for the land.

of the world. Its eastern and its and other public questions. Then,
western boundaries are two mighty
rivers capable of bearing immense
tonnage of navigation. It is crossed
by a number of the trunk lines of
very important railway systems. Its
soil, rainfall and climate are such
that, since its settlement by white
people, no serious crop failure has
been experienced. These same' con
ditions operate to make it possible
for most products of the temperate
zone to be produced here in abund
ance. Iowa is the very center of the
corn belt and excels in the produc
tion of that cereal. Its people are in
dustrious, law-abiding and intelligent,
and will compare favorably with peo
ple of any other part of the world.
The general practice of farm tenan
cy takes but very little into account
the all-important factor of retaining
or improving the fertility of the land.
No strictures too severe can be em
ployed to condemn the very general
practice of depleting soil fertility.
The greatest offender is the landlord.
It is within his power to bring about
a change. The tenant is compelled,
because of high rent and the short
term lease, to wring from the land all
possible returns. He cares but little
for returning any fertility back to the
soil, because next year, doubtless, he
will move elsewhere. Such a system
of tenancy robs the land, deprives
the landlord of possible returns, and
destroys in the tenant the interest he
should have in the soil, the buildings
and other improvements. It. makes
him careless as to the claim of the

having learned to labor together with
his fellow farmers, he must learn to
co-operate with the city man to solve
questions of community interest. -The
farmers must learn to insist that their
co-operation be taken and even wel
comed In the solution of transporta
tion problems. For a creat need of
Iowa farmers is a more intelligent
method of marketing their products.
Overabundance of products on ccrtain
market days, to be followed by .other
In this connection it might be point
ed out that a very great need of Iowa
in regard to location and kinds of
marketable products, thus bringing
producer and consumer In touch with
each other. Much local traffic might
be developed to the mutual advantage
of consumer, producer and transport-
traffic, lower freight rates ought to
obtain.
The working of Iowa farms involves
the use of an endless variety and
amount of farm machinery. For this
the farmers of the £tate pay out each
year an immense amount of money.
The manufacture and sale of this
machinery and kindred t'arm supplies
is in the hands of an immense com
bination which extorts millions of dol
lars yearly from Iowa farmers beyond
whet is a paying price. Bv combina
tion and concentration, both of manu
facture and of sales management,
there is a great economy of expendi
ture in the production of this machin
ery. But through manipulation these
great profits go to the stockholders of
the concern. The farmers do not
share in the lessened cost of manufac
ture. In this way immense fortunes
are accumulated in a few hands, and
the many are compelled to pay trib
ute to them. This Is fundamentally
wrong and does not comport with a
sense of common justice. What is
true of the implement trust is equally
true of the lumber trust, the packing
trust and other combinations. The
reason for this is that the farmers per
mit this state of affairs. They not
only sell their produce at the price the
other man offers, but they also pay
for their supplies the price exacted
by the sellers. The .federal covern
ment owes it to the citizens of the
state that above cited conditions be
speedily terminated. This should be
done not by abolishing combination
and concentration of production, but
by forcing combinations to give to its
customers some of the benefits of
economical production. And this could
easily be brought about if farmers
would co-operate and get in live touch
with their congressmen. A very great
need is for Iowa farmers to show
more intelligent interest in af
fairs.
Rural Credits.

much is needed to stock the land with

As agriculture Is the ma'nstay of

When the disease breaks out in any
locality, strict quarantine should be

time lost to treat the entire herd.
This is work that our national gov
ernment should assume, and with a
flxe.l determination should! ascertain
the cause and, if at all possibly sup
ply the remedy. To this end congress
should make most liberal appropria
tions to educate men for the work of
eradicating this disease and thus add
to the supply for the nation at large.
Conclusion.
Recognizing, as we do, the import
ance of the work outlined by the
Permanent American commission,
and the benefits that may bs secured,
not only by the producer, but by the
consumer, the former by Increased
production at less expense and the lat
ter by lowar prices through co-opera
tion with the producer, we have, in
the foregoing rerport, endeavored to
point the way to a better realization
of the possibilities in Iowa.
Wa must educate the boys and
young people on our farms in the
principles of scientific agriculture,
thereby creating an interest In the
work, and Instill into their minds the
great truth that the farm affords op
portunity for research and improve

There is a great falling off in the
number of live stock on Iowa farms
is well known. One of the mair. re.v
sons for this condition is the short
term farm lsase. While the owner
lived on his farm there was more
profit in raising live stock and feed
ing all the grain upon the farm than
in selling the grain. By this method
much fertilizing matter was returned
to tha soil and fertility was thereby
increased, but the short-term tenant
cannot afford to keep stock, his ten
ure being altogether too uncertain.
This condition Is one of the main
factors in the decrsase of nusmtoer of
cattle ln Iowa, and until there are
longer terms ln farm leases the
shortage will steadily increase, be
cause each year more farm owners
leave their farms and move to town.
