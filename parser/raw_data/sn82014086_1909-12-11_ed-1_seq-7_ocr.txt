Opinion of President's Message
Congressman Higgins Declares it is No Disappointment
to President Taft's Friends Reform of Currency
Law Important Merchant Marine Should Receive
Attention and Custom
Better Times Looked For
Washington, Dee. 10- Congressman
Higgins in an interview on President
Taft'a message spoke as follows:
President Taft's message is no dis
appointment to his friends. It shows
the marked characteristics of the man.
Wise, searching, conservative and
broad gauged, it not only merits the
closest analysis and consideration by
congress, which it will command, but
answers fully the requirements of the
executive under the constitution to
give congress from time to time in
formation of the state of the union and
recommend such measures as he shall
Judge necessary and expedient. Doubt
less much legislation during this ses
sion will be introduced and debated.
Some of it ought to pass and will. The
country is not ready for all of it, but
had rather see a more rigid enforce
ment of existing laws.
The reform of our currency laws Is
one of the most Important matters be
fore the country and this with the
problem of keeping our expenditures
within our income will of itself keep
congress busy.
The establishment of postal savings
banks needs careful consideration. If
all the country had as well managed
savings banks under such restrictions
as Connecticut, the need of a postal
savings bank would not be as great
as it appears now to be in some sec
tions. No state in the country has
better savings banks than Connecti
cut. The neglect of our merchant marine
is hardly short of a national disgrace
Its rehabilitation will, I hope, receive
the serious attention of congress. A
large producing and exporting nation
should carry its products in its own
ships. . Let our merchant marine be
built up at the same time we are deep
ening our rivers and harbors. While
we cannot legislate honesty Into men,
something ought to be done to prevent
a recurrence at some later time of the
contemptible and abhorrent conditions
disclosed in the New York customs
house, particularly with reference to
the sugar frauds. With no desire to
form a hasty conclusion, they never
theless seem to me to exceed in the
MONTHLY MEETING OF
PARISH HOUSE ASSOCIATION.
Mrs. George D. Coit Gave Interesting
Account of European Trip, as Did
Mrs. Edward D. Fuller.
There was a large attendance at the
regular monthly meeting of the Parish
House association held in the Osgood
Memorial on Friday afternoon, and
the meeting was an especially interest
ing one. It was conducted by tbe
president, Mrs. A. N. H. Vaughn, and
the usual reports were given by the
secretary, Miss Pullen; treasurer, Mrs.
Symington, and custodian, Miss Amy
Cogswell.
Mrs. William H. Allen furnished a
delightful musical programme. Her
first selection was Godagd s Florian
Song, followed by Hawley's Noon and
Night as an eifcore. Her closing pieces
were I Know a Bank, by Parker, and
Goodbye, Sweet Day, toy Vannah, Her
accompaniments were played by iMrs.
Frank Coxeter.
Mrs. George D. Coit gave an enter
taining account of her most enjoyable
experience during her trip abroad last
summer. This was the exciting Jour
ney of twenty-two miles up the moun
tains from, the Rhone to Zermatt and
the still more fearful climb- six miles
further to Gorner Grab at an elevation
of 11,000 feet. Zermatt is the highest
village in all Europe 6.000 feet and
Is a quaint old village of 1,200 inhab
itants In a pretty green valley foil of
Interest in itself and surrounded by
towering mountains peaks, among them
the famous iMatterhorn. From higher
up at Gorner Grab was unrolled a
wonderful panorama of mountains,
with fifty glaciers in sight Here the
party Indulged in a snowball contest,
it being the first day of August. She
also told of a visit up an ever steeper
railroad to Meuren. where one gets a
view of the Jungfrau ctoud of the
Alps.
Mrs. Edward D. Fuller read an ex
tremely Interesting paper describing
the events and places visited each Sun
day during her summer's Journey. The
first two were spent at sea. The third
was full of interest In exploring the
ancient town of Seville, with its im
mense cathedral and wonderful Giral
da. There was much to see in the ca
thedral, Including paintings by Murillo
and the tomb of Columbus. At Madrid
they went with Miss Elizabeth Hunt
ington to the church of the English
embassy. Four Sundays were spent In
Paris, attending the American church,
the Greek church, the McAll mission
and the church of St. Clotllde, besides
drives to Versailles and other things
which are always crowded into any
day in Paris. An interesting day was
spent in Amsterdam at the unveiling of
a tablet to the Pilgrim Fathers who
sought refuge there in 1609. This was
In the English reformed church, an In
teresting old edifice. Besides other
Sundays In Holland, Belgium and Swit
zerland, one was spent at Westminster
abbey, one at a beautiful old church on
the mountainside overlooking the sea
cathedral In Edinburgh and last but
not least one in Norwich. England.

ham and Miss Fannie L. Bliss. The
tea table was very pretty with Its
Christmas coloring of red and sreen.

STAFFORD SPRINGS MAN
WANTS NEW APPOINTMENT.
Likely That Frank A. Warfield Will Be
Named Deputy Commissioner of
Pension Office.
Frank A. Warfield of Stafford
Springs is an applicant for appoint
ment as one of the .deputy commis
sioners of the pension office, and his
chances for the place are said to be
yery good. There, are two of these
deputies, and the recent promotion of
the first deputy to be commissioner has
necessitated a change all around. Sen
ators Bulkeley and Brandegee on Fri
day morning called on President Taft
to present Mr. Warfield's name and he
also has the endorsement of all the
members from Connecticut in the
house.
Mr. Warfield has been for nearlv
thirty years in the pension office, and
Is at present chief of the western di
vision, to which place he was appoint
ed In 1897. This place pays a salary of
$2,000 a year, while the deputy gets
$3,600. Mr. Warfield was a candidate
for the same place he Is now seeking
about ten years ago, but failed to land
the plum.
Major Simonson Coming
Major L. M. Simsonson of Hartford
will arrive this evening to conduct
the meetings of the Salvation Army
tonight and all day on Sunday. A
Sunday morning service is to he held
at the Army headquarters st 11 a.
in addition to the afternoon and eve
ning services.
House .Frauds Prevented
V
existence of corruption the findings of
the Armstrong insurance Investigation

affect the public service, Wl the first

tariff discussion with a viewttfi amend
ing the new law will retard business
anil result in no improvement in the
present law, which before amendment
ought to be given a fair trial.
A general revival of business will
follow the New Year and the confi
dence of the country in. the ability of
Mr. Taft to administer his great office
will greatly contribute to that end.
New London Port of Entry.
Representative Higgins has intro
duced in the house a bill making New
London a port of entry, which was re
ferred to the committee on ways and
means.
In speaking of this bill Mr. Higgins
said:
"The bill which I have Introduced
proposes to extend to the port of New
London the privilege of immediate
transportation of merchandise Import
ed from abroad. Under the law mer
chandise destined for immediate
transportation shall be transferred, un
der proper supervision, directly, from
the importing vessel to the car, vessel
or vehicle in which the same is trans
ported to its 'final destination. This
right was granted to a number of ports
in the act of June 10, 1880.
"I have always believed that a
greater use could and should be made
of the splendid shipping facilities both
by water and rail at New London. The
congestion at New York and the high
rates prevailing there for warehouses
ought to operate to the advantage of
New London. This bill must receive
the favorable recommendation of the
ways and means committee, who will
undoubtedly refer it to the treasury
department, who may raise some ad
ministrative objections, or decide that
the commerce of the port of New Lon
don does not warrant the amendment
proposed. Under any event, I shall
work for its enactment."

RADIANT HAIR
New York Society Women's Hair
Matched Only, by Parisians
For many years the clever women of
Paris have been famed for the mugni
ficent beauty of their hair.
"Ghirious hair," a Virginian calls it;
"so radiant and luxuriant that it not
only attracts but fascinates,' and com
pels unstinted admiration." '
But now that the elite of New York,
ever anxious to Improve their 'beauty,
have learned that Parisian Sage, a re
mafkable and almost - marvelous hiiir
nourlsher and beautifier, . is almost
entirely responsible for the charming
hair of the ladies of France, the de
mand for it has become enormous.
A Philadelphia chemist who analysed
Parisian Sage said: "It l.- the idral
dressing for the hair. The ingredients
are so scientifically combined taut
Parisian Sage is first of all a hair
grower, because it HurWy destroys
dandruff germs, and nourishes the hair
roots."
"Second, it puts life. subtane and
brilliancy into the hair, which im
proves tbe attractiveness of any one."
"Third, It la very delicately scented;
Is not a particle sticky or greasy, utid
does not contain one atom of anything
that could possibly injure scalp or
hair.."
Parisian Sage is now sold all over
America by progressive druggists, and
in Norwich by Tho Lee & Osgood t'o.,
who is glad to guarantee it to eradi
cate dandruff, stop falling hair and
Itching scalp In two weeks or money
back.
Price 60 cents. Made In America by
Giroux Mfg. Co., Buffalo. N. T.. who

Auburn hair is on every package.
