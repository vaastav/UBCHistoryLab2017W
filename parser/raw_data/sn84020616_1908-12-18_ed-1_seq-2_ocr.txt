fTou) Vote t(W Bends
Whatever may have been the merits or demerit of the proposition sub
mitted to the city by the American Light and Power company for building a
aawer system, all discussion Is temporarily out of order, since the council at
special session last evening, rescinded its previous action, setting aside Its
Agreement to give the contract to the above company.
This now leaves the matter open to all bidders and should vanish every
opposition to the building of a sewer system In this dty and the voting of
bonds for that purpose.
Much opposition, it must be admitted, was aroused when It became
known that the council expected to exclude other bidders and it is doubtful
If a bond Issue would have been voted, under the circumstances, despite the
applanations made by Mayor Lester and others, eminently above suspicion of
elf-Interest In such matters.
Now, however, the bone of contention is removed and it Is up to the
people.
The question of issuing sewer bonds to the extent of $290,000 will come
before the citizens of Albuquerque for approval or rejection on January 19th,
1909, and it is unquestionably the duty of every one who has the best inter
ests of the city and of public health at heart to vote for the bonds.
The council, by resolution last night, declared that if the bonds were
voted, it would call for bids in lump sum and also on a percentage basis and
let the contract to the lowest bidder. This is eminently fair and does away
-with criticism.
It is needless to dilate upon the necessity for properly equipping this city
rlth a sewer system. Every resident of Albuquerque knows the need of such
avn Improvement with the least possible delay, fcvery property owner knows
Ilia increased value that would come to real estate with the completion of an
adequate sewer system.
While there are many who have plans to suggest as to tho building of a
sewer, there is no one who can advance a reason for not building a eewer.
The first step toward securing the sewerage system is to vote the bonds.
"We know what the sewer will cost at a maximum because the city is In pus
Maaion of the plans and specifications of its engineers, fixing the amount.
Therefor, a bond issue of $290,000 will cover this estimated expense and
if there is a surplus by r-ason of a lower bid, the balance will remain In pos
session of the city.
The people should devote their attention now, towards securing the bond
tasue and then the question of letting the contract can be taken up in due
time and a sewerage system constructed without delay.
Vote for. the bonds and help make greater Albuqurque.
The following from the Indianapolis News might well be applied to New
Mexico: The killing of an eagle Is in reported. Iaglea are bcomlng rare
in this part of the country. The eagle is our national bird. Why any one
should wish to destroy a living emblem is past finding out and yet whenever
a man with a gun can get a shot at an eagle he never falls to fire. His next
step particularly if his aim has been good, is to tell the newspapers of his
wonderful feat. The dimensions of the bird "from tip to tip" of wings are re
ported and the hunter is much puffed up with pride. If there is anything In
aantiment it would seem that it ought to extend to the American eagle; but
instead of protecting It the American people seem to be determlnd to exterml
ate It. A few more years and it will be classed with the great auk and
tmiAn only in the books.
A is usually the case, the people of Venezuela who pay the taxes are the
nes who will now suffer. Castro escaped from the country with the funds
f the treasury and Holland has besieged the coast. Some day the people will
learn enough to go out and hang rascals like any other criminals, but until
taey do, courts of justice as demonstrated in South America will be merely
tools for conspiring villlans. There is little difference between murder com
mitted by oppression and murder by deadly weapon.
