Horace Greeley.
On Saturday last the whole country
was thrown into a state of most unex
pected surprise and sorrow. The death
of no man in our land at this time, save
that of the president, would probably
have created so much sadness or been
received with so much grief as that of
Horace Greeley, and by none will be be
more sincerely mourned than the hun
dreds of thousands who felt it to be their
duty to oppose bis political position
the past few months.
The name of Horace Greeley has been
familiar in every household for a whole
generation. The weak and lowly have
- ever looked to him for counsel, and the
unfortunate, in season and out of season.
have never appealed to him in vain for
material aid. Like the martyred Lin
coin, he never forget the common pio
pie from whom he sprang, and to all
, mankind, without fear or favor, whether
political friend or foe, he dealt with lilie-
ral hand and generous trust.
It he had errors and who has not ?
it is not fitting to canvass them to-day.
For thirty years he valiantly battled for
truth and humanity, and a whole gener
ation in our country, are to-day, wiser,
better and more intelligent for his work.
He was the great American journalist,
and in this rests bis great fame, and where
he was hardly equalled by any other
man in the world. The world is better
because he lived, and in his death a great
light has gone out.
The Death of Mr. Greeley.
The death of Horace Greeley has cre-
ated a profound sensation of sympathy
and sorrow throughout the laud. Iu va
rious places public and official action
has been taken. On Tuesday the re
mains of the great journalist laid in
state at the ci'y Hall of New York, and
were visited by thousands. The city
park in front of the building was literal
ly a jam of humanity who passed the
coffin at the rate of one hundred per
minute. Flags were at half mast, and
there has been no such demonstration,
since the funeral of Lincoln. The funer
al was on Wednesday, and attended by
the president and several of the mem
bers of the cabinet. Among the pall
bearers were Vice President Colfax, Sec
retary Boutwell, W. L. Garrison, Chief
Justice Chase, Charles Sumner, Wui.
Cullen Bryant, Gen. Banks, Thurlow
Weed, Thomas Hooker and the Tribune
attaches.
At tne neaa ot the remains were
placed the last words of the deceased,
" It is done," in white immortelles. Mr.
Greeley lay with his left arm by his side
and the right across his breast. His
face was emaciated and worn, utterly
unlike that which his daily companions
have been accustomed to see. His ap-
, pearance was that of a man who had, af
ter terrible suffering, succumbed in a
prolonged fight with the combined forces
of mental and bodily anguish. The cof
fin was black, with heavy silver handles.
The lid bore the inscription: "Horace
Greeley, born February 3d, 1811 ; died
November 29th, 1872," and was orna
. men ted with festoons and natural fern
, leaves. At the head was a sacred in
scription : "I know that my Redeemer
liveth : " and another worked in violets :
" The city mourns our loss."
The waiting multitude was formed in
line, and passed into the room where the
body was lying with uncovered heads.
Each was allowed sufficient time tovinw
the dead. Many ladies showed signs of
emotion, some stopping to kiss the fore
head of the deceased. As the dinner
hour of the working class approached,
the crowd became enormous. Laborers
came down town in working clothes to
- get a last look at the face of their cheery
old friend. Working-girls came from
their factories and stores, and were al
' lowed to pass in before the men. Pas
sages was made for all persons accom
panied by ladies. Families, evidently
; from the country, came together, and
the " old folks " could not restrain their
tears as they looked on the face of the
man who had, as it were, lived in their
hearts for half a life-time. Many ne
groes were in the line. It is estimated
that 50,000 persons viewed the remain
during the day and evening, and thou
sands were unable to reach even the
steps of the city hall.
His ows Obituary. Mr. Greeley
wrote a characteristic letter last Juoe, to
a warm personal friend of his at Wash
ington, Mr. Lanman, who now makes it
public It seems almost like an obitua
ry of himself by himself, and will be
read with interest :
New York. June 27, 1872.
Friend Lanman : Received yours of
25ib, iost. I have all my Iifebteo doing
what people called vastly foolish, impo
litic acts, and I did not dispute their
judgment. I only said that what I did
seemed to me the right thing. If I
should die before election, or be beaten
herein, please testify for me that I do
not regret having braved public opinion
when I thought it wrong and knew it to
be merciless. Yours,
Horace Greeley.

in Michigan was 54,360, which was pret

Coiiirresn,
Congress met on Monday and among
the first tilings done was to take appro
priate action of sympathy relative to the
death of Horace Greeley. Judge Po
land of this Stale was appointed chair
man of the special investigating com
mittee of the Credit Mobilor, and Sena

bis intention in a few days to call up
the subject of endowment for national

President's Message.
The President's Message was prompt
ly submitted to Congress on Monday. It
is largely devoted to domestic affairs,
which are treated in a very common
sense manner. It expresses sympathy
for the sufferers by the Boston tire, and
congratulates the country upon the re
sult of the Geneva Arbitration, and fa
vors a fair trial of civil service reform.
Peaceful relations continue with ail for
eign powers, and for the first time in a
quarter of a century there is no disputed
boundry line between this country and
England. The message as a whole is re
ceived with very general favor.
New Hampshire.
Our New Hampshire neighbors are
beginning to talk over their political af
iairs for next spring, more especially
'with reference to congressman in third
district, just over the river. Since they
will very likely give us some good man
iu any event, it is not for outsiders to
meddle, but we can't nelp expressing a
hope that they will le-nominaie, and this
time elect, Gen. S. G. Griffin of
Keene. Two years ago the republicans
mainly through their own apathy and
neglect, not only failed in his district,
but throughout the State, and a more de
serving man it does not seem to us can
be found in that district, and certainly
the republicans owe it as a duty to them
selves to set aright tlieir accidental rec
ord of two years ago. Gen. Griffiu, we
believe, enlisted as a private early in the
war against the rebellion, and earned
all the promotion he received by hard
service in the field, in the face of the
enemy, and came out of the contest a
Major General, and with the award of
" Well done thou good and faithful ser
vant," and being of sound political faith,
and among the strong men of the good
old Granite State, we shall hope to see
him sent to the national legislature.
Sad and Romantic. Charles E.
Hulse of Jeffersonville, Kentucky, died
in New Albany, on Sunday morning,
Nov. 24th, of confluent small pox, after
an illness of eleven days. The circum
stances attending hs sickness and death
are at once sad and romantic. He was
engaged to be wedded to Miss Mollie
Miller, a young lady living in New Al- j
bany, the marriage being fixed for some
time during the holiday season. Three
weeks ago Miss Miller was taken with
the small-pox, aud a congestive chill
setting in with the disease, she died.
During her sickness, notwithstanding its
contagious aud fatal character, Mr.
Hulse was constant in his attendance at
her bedside, caring tenderly for her. His
devotion produced the result which he
could not but have anticipated. A short
week after Miss Miller's death Mr. Hulse
was prostrated with the Bame disease.
His grief at the loss of his betrothed
had rendered him indifferent to the re
sult; and, indeed, he made up his mind
to die from the beginning of bis illness,
telling several of his friends, and writ
ing to his relatives, that he would not
nd did not care to recover, and begging
them not to jeopardize their lives by
coming to see him.
Tragic Death of a Boy. On Thur-
day afternoon of last week, at Rochester
New York, several boys, whose ages
range from fifteen to seventeen years,
were amusing themselves by shooting at
a target with a revolver in a vacant lot
on Goodman btreet. While the pistol
was in the hands of Samuel Bend one
chamber was prematurely discharged,
and the ball entered the body of Wil
liam Cook, who exclaimed : " lam shot
through the heart ; go for a doctor."
He then ran a few feet, sauk upon his
knees, and exclaiming, " This is a sorry
afternoon's work," expired. Bend and
his companions were arrested, and are
held in custody to await the result of a
coroner's inquest.

The total vote of Kansas for Preri
dent was about 103,000, an increase ol
42,000 in two years. This indicates an
increase of population of more than
100,000 in a Tear, which is believed to
be unprecedented in the history of any
other State.

his father and brother in a little shop,
which gradually grew into a huge and
wealthy establishment.
The Lant Day (and Night) of the
Session.
Tbore was not so great a crowd of
business on the last day of the session,
Tuesday and Tuesday night of last week
as some anticipated. Indeed some of
the time business moved as leisurely as
in the middle of the session. During the
forenoon of Tuesday a protracted discus
sion ensued on the bill relating to the
quinquetiuial valuation of real estate iu
Chittenden, Franklin and Grand Isle
ixjuuties. lbere was a manituat in
justice in the assessment of real estate
iu at least a portion of these counties in
1870, and this bill was to correct the
same. The House, however took a dif
ferent view, hardly denying the justice
of the claim, but a large number of the
members took the ground that the fault
wag nearer home, and that it was not the
duty of the legislature to act the part of
assessors or listers. We do not see why,
however, it wag Dot just as proper a mat
ter for legislation, as the legalizing or
correcting of a grand list so frequently
done by all legislatures.
The day wore and business became
more lively. About once in five hours
the ghost to rescind the resolution to ad
journ would appear, and although at
first the vote was close, 105 to 109, the
friends of adjournment were finally able
to rally at about 5 o'clock Tuesday after
noon and carried a vote for adjourn
meut 127 to 87.
last hours of the session.
And now came the " hurrying to and
fro." Every member very naturally
thinks his own bills of the greatest im
poriance, and fears they will fail for
want of time, and especially are his fears
aroused as he sees a huge pile of bills
on the Speaker's desk. Members'go to
the Speaker, and whisper in his already
overburdened ears, to the clerk, to the
cleik's office, to the Senate, to the Secre
tary of the Senate, back to the House,
and last but by no means of the least
consequence, to the chairman of the
committee on bills, Mr. Buel of Middle-
town, whose duty it was to see that all
bills passed were duly presented to the
governor for his signature, and whose
large patience and great good nature
made him the right man in the right
place. A member inquires of him how
many other members have thus ap
proached him in parental care of their
bills. He smiles and is unable to give
that census; they are "too numerous to
mention." Dr. Scott of Plymouth, sen
ator from Windham County, faithfully
performs this duty for the Senate, and as
business presses comes to the House for
the signature of the Speaker. During a
recess of the Senate, a senator pulls out
a bill buried deep down in a pile on the
president's desk, and carefully lays the
same on top so that the impartial presi
dent will find it early when the session is
resumed. How deeply that same bill
may still be buried wbeu the president
assumes the chair is not known, for the
reason that the number of other senators
who may have done the same thing is
also unknown.

mock sessions.
During the recesses, the House had
two mock sessions, in which some lively
jokes were perpetrated. In one of these
sessions the member from Chester was
called to the chair, and we can assure
his constituents that he fairly rivaled
the palmiest days of the Chester dra
matic club. He however had a Wild
man for a clerk as well as the Bottom of
of the committee on education !
At about three o'clock, a. m., the Sen
ate had a mock session, said to be unpre
cedented for that grave body, but at
that stilly hour, when the House were on
" solemn duty," there came a roar from
Senate chamber, which wonld have done
credit to a California earthquake. The
cause of the commotion we have never
learned, it may have been the explosion
of a late gat bill in that body 1

Death of Horace Greeley !
HIS LAST DAYS AND HOURS.
Although the serious illness of Horace
Greeley was announced on Thursday and
Friday, the country was not at all pre
pared for the announcement on Saturday
morning of nis death, which occurred
Friday evening, at ten minutes to seven
o'clock.
It appears that soon after resuming
control of the Tribune Mr. Greeley's
health began to break down, and he
found it impossible to continue his jour
nalistic labors. On Tuesday, the 19tb,
iust., he left the city and went to the res
idence of Mr. J. Stewart, an old friend
at Tarrytown, on the Hudson. On the
following day (Wednesday) Mr. Greeley
was driven to the residence of Dr. Choate,
a farm-bouse on the Pleasautville road,
about five miles from Tarrytown, and
less than half that distance from Chap
paqua. During the afternoon of Wednes
day, aud on -Thursday and Friday, he
remained out of bed ; but on tha day
following it became apparent that he
was last losing ground, and, by direction
of bis physicians, be remained in bis
room. Since his arrival at Tarrytown,
Mr. Greeley had evinced great mental
disquietude on the subject of his world
ly affairs, and the impression grew upon
him to such an extent that he became
gloomy and despondent, and refused to
take more than a small portion of nour
ishing food at long intervals. After be
ing confined to his room, Mr. Greeley
continued failing, and on Tuesday, or
exactly one week from the day of his
arrival at Tarrytown, his physicians
plainly saw that the chances of recovery
were tew. It was then resolved to keep
the locality in which he lay a secret
from his friends, and only his daughter
Ida, Mr. and Mrs. ' Stewart, " Auntie "
Lamson and two of the Tribune mana
gers were admitted to his bedside. Dr.
Linson, of Tarrytown, joined Dr. Choate
on Tuesday, and together they watched
by his bedside to the last. On Tuesday
night the patient became unconscious,
and remained so up to the following af
ternoon, when he rallied sufficiently to
recognize those about him. He slept at
intervals during the next twenty-four
hours, but on Thursday night he became
restless, and when F.iday morning
dawned, it was plain that he could not
live but a few hours longer. At three
o'clock Friday afternoon, he regained
consciousness and answered in monosyl
lables all questions addressed to him,
and during the afternoon recognized his
attendants, shaking hands with his
daughter who stood at his side. At
this time he had become pulseless, and
his hands and feet were cold. At half
past six o'clock Dr. Choate summoned
the attendants to the side of the bed, and
they gathered on the left side, Miss Ida
Greeley holding her father's hand, Mr,
and Mrs. Stewart standing by his head,
while Mr. Edward Carpenter, his physi
cian and others stood near the foot of
the bed. Mr. Greeley's eyes brightened,
and he murmured, " I know that my
Redeemer liveth. It is done." Then
his eyes closed slowly, and at 63 o'clock
he breathed his last.
HIS DISEASE AND HIS DEATH.
The World, which, from intimate per
sonal relations of Mr. Chamberlain, one
of its leading editors, with Mr. Greeley
and bis family, is almost better authori
ty on the subject of his disease and last
hours of his life than the Tribune, makes
the following statements, which, in part,
agree with the account published by the
Tribune, though the portion in regard to
his condition previous to election, has
never been stated by the latter journal,
nor indeed with any authorativeness by
any other : The time has now come when
the whole truth of his illness cannot with
justice be longer withheld. It is proba
ble tbat Mr. Greeley's mind had been se
riously affected before even the presiden
tial election took place. The severe tax
upon his mental and physical system
produced by the great labor which he
performed immediately before the Oc
tober elections, the disastrous result im
mediately after, the chagrin which be
felt at the consequences of the Tribune
aud to himself from his candidature, the
illness and death of Mrs. Greeley, prey
ed constantly upon his mind, so that be
fore the final decision of the presidential
contest, even, his vigor of mind had been
irreparably impaired. After that time
and before his fatal illness, it is under
stood that he was examined by Dr.
Brownof the Bioomingdale asylum
and other medical experts, and tbat
the opinion given was that even had
it been possible for him to have surviv
ed the sickness which has resulted in his
death, be would have remained a victim
of melancholia, one of the most incura
ble forms of dementia.
During the last day of hit life his
physical suffering was extremely alight.
but a morbid action of the tuiud was
evident from exterior manifestations. At
half-past 5 o'clock an old family friend,
known as "Auntie Lamson," entered and
approached his bed. Mr. Greeley was
then roused by hio friends and asked,
" Do you know who this is?" He feebly
said, " Yes," stretched up bis hand iu
greeting, and then relapsed into his rev
erie. Later he was asked, " Do you
know that you are dying I" In the same
manner, without tremor or emotion, he
answered " Yes." Again, when asked if
he recognized Mr. Reid, he looked up
with immediate recognition, lifting his
hand, grasped Mr. Raid's feebly, and
said distinctly " Yes." When asked if
he was in pain he laid his hand upon his
breast, but without otherwise replying,
returned to his semi-conscious state, ly
ing now with closed eyes and hands,
sometimes twitching nervously, but gen
erally still. At half-past six o'clock he
stirred uneasily ,'and began to mutter in
distinctly something which the frieuds
around him could not catch. Hisdaugh
ter Ida, Mrs. Stewart, Mr. Carpenter,
Dr Choate, and Auntie Lamson were all
in the room anxious to hear his last
words. Mr. Greeley indistinctly mur
mured for a while, and at last feebly
said, " It is done." There was no evi
dence of paiu in the last moments. The
face hardly changed, only settling into a
look of perfect peace.

A Glorious Record. Twelve years

Journal invited public attention to anew
Vegetable Kestoiauve, and solicited i

bility, nervous disorders, rheumatism,
and all complaints requiring invigorating
and regulating treatment, la this quiet,
unpretentious way, plantation Bit

was a success from the beginning. All
tbat was claimed for it ai a tonic, a cor
rective and autidote to malarious fever,
was found to be sinctly true. Within
five years the annual sales of this arti

Li at Centaur Liniment ?
What is it cures our pains,
And limbers up severest strains,
hut Centaur Liniment ?
That knocks Rheumatism out of gear
Ifids gout good-bye without a tear,
Why! Centaur Liniment,
Causes the cripple to walk, the lame to leap,
liearu to thankt instead ot tes to weep,
Only Centaur Liniment.
What renders reptiles tooth and sting of bees.
Harmless as the bite of Hems,
Excepting Centaur Liniment.
Assuages the pangs of a broken breast,
J: low tne lacteal ttuid gives nights of rest,
But Centaur Liniment.
And when chilblains sting or hot steam scalds.
W uat is it sootnci lor wuatcan we call,
But Centaur Liniment.
When the oar crushed old Tilden's arm,
Twas saved trom amputation by this charm.
The Centaur Itiniment.
And when Barn urn's lion. Uncle Ben.
Broke his leg in that dismal den.
lie roared tor Centaur Liniment.
Now as the poor horse. lame and sore.
Who crippled kueeliuifs toour door,
Aud begs tor Centaur Liniment.
And the docile sheep on a thousand hills
lie by the milium the screw worm kills,
All saved by Ceutaur Liniment.)
We hear if shouted from West to East,
By ftpeaking mau and neighing beast,
" Pass on uie Ceutaur Liuiment.H
