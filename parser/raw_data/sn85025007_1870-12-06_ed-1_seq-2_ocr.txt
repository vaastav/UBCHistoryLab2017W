TUESDAY. DECEMBER 6. 1870
The President's Message.?Wc furnished
our readers, yesterday, the President's
Message io ao extra sheot. As it is not long
it will be generally read, and a synopsis is,
therefore, not necessary. It is neither in style,
Dor matter,at all extraordinary. The tone towards
Great Britain and the Canadian authorities
is, if not unfriendly, at least, sufficiently
adversers to please those who are "so straight
as to lean over"?the "acquisition" of St. DomlDgo
Is still pressed?the proposed "Revenue
reform" is pronounced against, &c. The
cono'usion of the Message gives what purports
to be "the policy of tho Administration,"
which, as far as xcords are concerned,looks fair
enough?the only difficulty being that the
"words" have not been carried out or fulfilled
by "acts." The real "polioy" of the Administrat'on
is to uphold the Radicil party, and
to continue it ia power?in many instances to
tho oppression of the people, and to the injury
of the true interests of the country.
European News.?This morning's mail
briDgs us but little Dews of interest,beyond what
wa9 published in our telcgraphio dispatches in
yesterday's Gazctto. The Prussians pushed
their advantages successfully, got in rear of
Orleans, and threatened to shell the city if it
was Dot given up. The French commander at
Orleans, Gen. Pellieres, immediately spiked
tho fixed guns on the fortifications, burned all
stores that could not be removed, and retired,
with hiB corps, to the south bank of the Loire.
There has been "much fighting generally," of
which we have contradictory accounts. Affairs
must soon come to a crisis. The present seitrc
of Paris, and the present mode of conducting
the war, cannot, we should think, last much
loDger.
In a laudation of the President's Message,
the Washington Chronicle says :
"At a moment when the whole world contemplates
the sublime possibility of a universal
republic, a paper like that of President Grant
will bo acoepted at onoe as a contrast and an
example."
Now, we dou'c believe that one man ir, ten
thousand in the "whole world" contemplates
the sublime possibility of any such thing as a
"universal republic"?and therefore the "contrast
and the example" eo lor nothing. The
"whole world" }s a big thing in its way?and
there aro moro peoplo living in it who never
<.t flan Qrant. I bun there src those
who read his message or regard it as either u
"contrast or an example."
It is said that the imputation of "violated
confidence," (in relation to the publication of
Admiral Porter's letter written in lS65,)agoiost
Mr. Wells, then Secretary of tho Navy, is with
out ground; for it was written with the general
forms of official correspondence, dated "North
Atlantic Squadron, United States flag ship
Malvern, Cape Fear river, January 2d, 1SG5," I
and addressed to "the Hon. Gidenu Wells, I
Secrotary of the Navy, Washington, P. C,"
and had no mark of a merely per.-onni epistle,
or confidential correspondence ahnut it. It is
certaioly a most unfortunate affair for Ad
miral Porter.
In the IJ. S. Senate, yesterday, bills were
introduced by Mr. Sumner for the resumption
of speoio payment.-; by Messrs. Coin and (Jasserly
for the repeal of the income tax, and by
Mr. Kellogg for the removal of political disabilities:
all of which were sent t > the .appropriate
committees. Mr. Sherman moved to
take up the ifou^c biil by which the disfranchisement
of the disabled so'dicrs in the Asylum
at Dayton, Ohio, wi:! be prevented, but
withdrew his motion, alter giving notice that
he wou'd renew it to day.
Tho 'Philadelphia Ledger w&li says: ?"A
life time of observation as to stock investments
has led us to this one conclusion, that, as the
rule, it evidences a want of wisdom to send
capita! tar from homo to be disbursed and con
trolled by speculators. It is far better to have
capital expended near where it is owned, as its
influence comes more directly home, telling ad
vantageously on all surroundings ; besides
which, those who manage home enterprise*;
are our neighbors, whom we know, and can
trust or watch as their characters merit."
Tho very reprchcnt-iblo practice of "applauding"
has been commenced already in the House
of Representatives. Wo read that "after the
reading of the President's Message, yesterday,
the Radioal sido of the House indicated its sat
isfaction by applause." It this is allowed,
why may Dot' the Conservative side ol' the
House "indicate" its dissent by exhibitions of
dissatisfaotioo. And i( both sides pursue this
course, why may there not be, what would be
oalled in a political meeting?"a row"?
An unsuccessful attempt was made in the
House of Representatives by Messrs. Piatt,
Schenck, and other Radical loaders, to prevent
Mr. Duke, ot Virginia, Ircrn taking the seat
to whioh he wes elected to supply the vacancy 1
caused by the death of Mr. Ridgway. Mr.
Duke was sworn in, and took his seat.
It is said, in Washington, that the lobby,
is better represented this winter, bettor organi
zed, more abundantly supplied, and altogether
much more effective iu its ability to accomplish
its objects than ever before, ft is under
stood now, that the "lobby" is a permanent attache
to CoDgress.
Earl Granville's reply to Gortschakoff s last
note accepts Russia's invitation to a conference,
but admits no foregone conclusion as to its result.
Russia's reply to Von Beust's last note J
is the same with that to Granville. I./
ALEXAND
The President ncs no word io bis message
about a "general Emnpsty" and it is believed by
many that his party in Congress this sessson,
will not be as liberal on that score, as they
were nt the last.
The Washington Patriot says, speaking of
the President's Message, "we expected ittfo
from Con. Gianr, and have not been disappointed."
The census returns for Virginia arc now
complete. The whole population rf the State

A few days since while John P. Ballard, for
merly of the Richmond Exchange Hotel, was
proceeding to his (arm in Henrico, in his carriage,
a colored woman (I) who was out hunting,
discharged her gun on the road side at a

containing Mr. B. causing the horses to run off,
break the vehicle, and severely bruise and injure
its occupant, who was pitched out headlong.

, Admiral Porter's Explanation.?The
1 following letter has been addressed to thn
| President, by Admiral Porter, under date ol
. Dee. 3, lbTO. The "chickens are coming home
t to roost," according to the old proverb. 'Lherc
i are more people than the President who have,
1 in these days particularly, "lost faith, in human
nature." But comment is unnecessary :
"Mr. President: My first impulse, on rnadj
ing the letter published in the New York
[ World, was to go to you at once and pronounce
j it a fabrication, for us such I considered it;
i but as it purported to have been written six
] years ago and published by a, person who once
held a prominent position under the Govern.
incnt, I determined to ascertain fully if I had
. ever indited such a letter, bclorc addressing
you on the subject.
Neither myself nor my secretary, who lias
served with mo eight years, could recall to our
1 recollection any circumstance of this kind. I
| could not conceive 1 had uttered sentiments I
; knew 1 Iiad never felt, and which are so at
vnriancc with those I have uniformly express
ed towards you. The letter, it appears, was a
" private one, and vindictive must have been the
' heart of the man that could bo guilty of so

deed iduJ*t have been the character who, to
; gratify his mischievous interests, could make
1 public a confidential letter, written, perhaps,
2 under great excitement, and at this distant
' day not. even remembered.
1 Jt see ins like a poor return for your uniform
( confidence and kindness to rue, and I am too
1 elad that I remember nothing connected with
1 the letter.
At about tho data of the letter L had passed
: through a long and fatiguing conflict with Fort
; Fisher, and my numerous fleet was almost
- overpowered by the elements. 1 saw the c ive
ted priza within my grasp, and then slip from
. me. For another month I had to battie with
the storms of winter, anchored ou an oneu
/ coast, with the responsibility of that large fleet
2 on my hands, tuy mind and body harassed by
extraordinary fatigue. The whole nation was
looking on, excited, and dreading failure.
Id was under such excitement that I presume
, I wrote the letter which you say has made you
\ lose your faith in human Daturc. When several
, persons have at different times informed me
3 that a letter would be published, in which I
r had abused General Grant, 1 treated the matter
with indifference, thinking it impossible
that such a letter couid exist. I do not write
for the purpose of exonerating myself. I
would rather be the writer of such a letter than
its publisher.
I regret exceedingly the loss of your friend
ship, and do not hesitate to disapprove the
" sentiments of which I suppose I mu6t bear the
1 odiuui. They appear in a letter of which I
have no recollection ; they are so different
) from the sentiments i always express toward
i youself and the gallant officers of the army,
end are so inconsistent with all my antece
dents-, that I scarcely consider them entitled to
1 a moment's thought."
Tiif, Hog Pifease.?A correspondent of the
) True Index, at Warrenton, writes:
"The writer has been making cautious dis
, sections of the viscera of a number ol boas with
, a view to determine the sear, extent and cause
' of the so called hog cholera. This disoaso has
, destroyed largo numbers o! hogs in Loudoun
i county.
, In a lot belonging to a farmer of Upper Fauquier,
that were fatted for family use and were
apparent'? healthy, these investigations were
begun. In the diseased ones, the glands, particularly
the liver, were mostly aff-cted, sor
. cus cysts, blister like in lorm. were scattered
. over tho surface of"the liver and were sometimes
imbedded in its substance, varying from the
size of a piu's head to that of ao egg, and fill
, cd with serum or pus. The air vesicles of the
lungs ia several cases were destroyed and rre.
sented cavities containing pus with other signs
, of pneumonitis.
The viscera appear, however, to bo the scat
I of this class of disease, though the bowels are
not always affected. By the presence of a noisou
tho blood may ho tho "Iocs ct orieo" of the
evil. True cholera which for several years, it
is weii known, has prevailed among the fcath
cry tribes of the poultry yards, is always accompanied
by a serious lesion of the mucous mem
braDo? which it denudes and well nigh destroys.
The fluid portion of the blood escapes by watery
discharges.
This subject is open fur investigation. The
best remedy for tho cure of tho so called hog
cholera is to change the stock. M.
Fauquier County.?The exterior of our
Court-house building will soon bo made to

Col. Payne and Gen Lomax left Warrenton

Clerical Dress.? In at is rather a droll
classification ol clergymen to which the Lou
don Church Review treats i?s readers. Parser s
with cravats and collars are L.-w Cimrcb ; pursons
with cravats and no ejoais arc High
Church ; parsons with cellars and tic cravats
are Broad t.'hurch. We remember a parson
who courageously came out io pantaloons of
a wed! pronounced check; but there followed a
tremendous congregational excitement, and
the poor man had tu go back to sable ioexprcs
si hies, or .'cave the lambs who were worrying
him to their late, flu had an interview with
bis tailor, and all ?us serene. ?Ronton Jour.

Lawyeks in Washington.?There are
about four hundred different lawyers of nearly
as many different kinds in this city. One patent
agent returns an income of $30,000. The
innumerable c'aim ageDts all get the cootiD1
gene shave of 25 per oent. The Chief Justice
i oi the Court ot Claims is about to resign to
I prosecute claims. Somo large firms practice
j only belore the Land Office. There are few
, lawyers at the Jocal district bar who receive
I above $0,000 per aunum. Davidgc. Merrick,
| N. Wilson, and Cox have the chief practice,
j worth perhaps $12 000 a year apiece. J ames
j T. Carlisc is the most successful of the native
| citizens before the Supremo Court. Other
lawyers practice almost entirely beforo the
State Department and the Mexican Commission.
Many of the attorneys hero arc poor,
and willing to pick up almost any sort of case
or adventure.? W'ash Cor. Clucar/o Trfljune.
iloq Chop.?The hog crop of Ka?t Tennessee
wiil he :argcr this season than it has been
since the war. The tanners have been blessed
with an unusuaily large corn ctop, a favorable
season, and no interference from the ravages
ol cholera. In addition a great improvement
in the stock has added considerably to ihe|
crop. East Tennessee is undoubtedly one of
the fiaest locations in America for profitably
rai^iug hoes and ail kinds of stock.?Kaoxvillc
Whir/.
[The "hog crop," in all the Western country,
is said to be very large, j
Apples.?-A good many apples arc coming
to market in the barrel. Wine saps, limber
twigs, crenitanf and Father Abrams sell at
from $2.50 to $3.00 per barrel, depeuding
upon the quality. What is known as the Albemarle
Jpippin sella for $3.00 per barrel.?
There is a general complaint over the country
that apples are rotting. Greenings aud russets,
which usually keep all wioter, are going imo
rapid dissolution. This is supposed to be ow
iug to the eHriy rineDing of the fruit.?Fm?
