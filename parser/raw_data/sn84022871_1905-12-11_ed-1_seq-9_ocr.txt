- President Roosevelt's annual mes
sage to congress opens with a plea foi
Ntae co-operation of all classes in con
tlnulng the country's prosperity and Id
correcting existing evils, for a "square
deal" for everybody, and first takes uj
tbe question of corporations and rail
road, rate legislation. Tbe president
yes is:
I am in no sense hostile to corpora
tions. The corporation bas come te
Ktav. just as the
trades union has
come to stay. Each
can do and has
done great good.
Each should be
favored so long" as
it does good. But
each should be
sharply checked
where It" acts
azainst law and
Justice. . I believe that regulation and
supervision of great corporations, etc,
" can be obtained by the enactment of
law by the congress. -
' " The Immediate and most pressing
need so Xar as legislation Is concerned
- U the enactment into law of some
ncheme to secure to the agents of the
government such supervision and regu
" lation of the rates charged by the rail
' roads of the country engaged In Inter
state traffic as shall summarily and ef
fectively prevent the Imposition of un
just or unreasonable rates. It must
Include putting a complete stop to re
abates in every shape and form.
In my Judgment, the most important
provision which such law should con
tain Is that conferring upon some com
petent administrative body the power
to' decide upon the case being brought
before it, this decision to go into effect
within a reasonable time and to obtain
j;from thence onward, subject to review
by the courts.
All private car Jines, industrial roads,
refrigerator charges and the like
should be expressly put under the su
pervision of the interstate commerce
commission' or some similar body, so
far as .rates and agreements practical
ly affecting rates are concerned. A re
.bate in Icing charges or in mileage or In
'division of the rate for refrigerating
I charges is just as pernicious as a re
''bate in. any other way.
There should be publicity of the ac
counts of common carriers. 'Only in
this way can violations or evasions of
the law be surely detected.
I hope that an employers' liability
"law will be prepared and enacted as
speedily as possible.
The remedy is to regulate the pro
cedure in issuing injunctions in labor
disputes is by requiring the judge to
give due notice to the adverse parties
.before granting the writ, the hearing
' to be ex parte If the adverse party doea
not appear at the time and place or
dered. What Is due notice must4epehd
upon the facts of the case.
.1 recommend an investigation by the
department of commerce .and labor of
general labor conditions, especial at
' tention to be paid' to the' conditions. of
child labor and child labor legislation
in the "several states.
j The department of commerce and la-
v b'or should also make a thorough Inves
tigation of the Conditions ofi women In
industry. Over 5,000,000 American wo
men are now engaged in gainful occu-
. pations, yet there is an almost complete
dearth of data upon which to base any
trustworthy . conclusions as regards a
subject as important as It is vast and
complicated. The Introduction of wo
men in Industry ; is working change
-; and -disturbance x In the domestic' and
7 social life of the nation. The decrease
fn marriage, and especially in the birth
rate, has been coincident wih it.
Recent events have emphasized, the
4 importance of an early and exhaustive
consideration of the insurance question.
to see whether it Is" not possible to fur
nish better safeguards than the several
states have been able to furnish against
-corruption of the flagrant kind -which
has been exposed. "t
It Is Impossible to outline what shape
- a readjustment of the revenues should
' take, for it Is as yet too early to say
whether there,, will be need for It. It
should b considered whether it is not
desirable that the tariff laws should
, . provide for applying as. against or In
favor of any other nation's maximum
and minimum tariff rates established
.. .by the congress, so as to secure a cer
tain reciprocity of treatment between
"' "other nations and ourselves.

Every consideration of prudence de
mands the addition of the element of
elasticity to our currency system. In

vision snouid be made that will insure

fall and winter months than In the less
active seasons of the year so thatthe
currency will contract against specula

The Ha$ue conference to the end that
substantial progress may be made in

The president repeats his recom
mendation In his last
regarding federal elections.
, We must as a nation make it evi
dent that we do not inteid to treat the
Monroe doctrine in any shape or way
as an excuse for aggrandizement on our
part at the expense of the republics to
the south. But we must make It evi
dent that we do not Intend to permit it
to be used by any nation on this conti
nent as a shield to protect it from the
consequences of Its own misdeeds
against foreign nations.
Santo Domingo has now made an ap
peal to us, and not only every principle
of wisdom, but every generous instinct
within us, bids ns respond to the ap
peal. The conditions in Santo Do
mlngo have f or a number of? Tears
grown from' bad to worse until a year
ago all society was on the verge of dissolution.-
Under the course taken by us
Stability and order and all the benefits
of peace are at last coming to Santo
Domingo, danger of foreign interven
tion has been suspended, and there is at
last a prospect that all creditors will
get justice, no more and no less.
I do not believe that any army in the
world has a better average of enlisted
man or a better type of junior officer,
but the army should be trained to act
effectively in a mass. Provision
should be made by sufficient appropria
tions for maneuvers of a practical
kind, for the promotion of exceptional
ly meritorious men over the heads of
their comrades and for the retirement
of all men who have reached a given
age without getting beyond a given
rank.
, Our navy must, relatively to the na
ivles of other nations, always be of
greater size than our army. We have
most wisely continued for a number of
years to build up our navy, and It
has now reached a fairly high standard
of efficiency. This standard must not
only be maintained, but increased.
In my last message I asked the at
tention of the congress to the urgent
need of action to make our criminal
law more effective, and I most ear
nestly request that you pay heed to the
report of the attorney general on thjs
subject.
To the spread of our trade In peace
and the defense of our flag In war a
great and prosperous merchant marine
Is indispensable. We should have ships
of our own and seamen of our own to
convey our goods to neutral markets
and in case of need to re-enforce our
battle line.
a matter of unmixed satisfac-
call attention to the excellent
the pension bureau, for the'vet-
the Civil war have a greater
claim upon us than any other class of
citizens. To them first of all among our
people honor is due.
We cannot have too much immigra
tion of the right sort, and we should
have none whatever of the wrong sort.
The questions arising in connection
with Chinese immigration stand by
themselves. As a people we have talked
much of the open door in China, and we
expect and quite rightly intend to insist
upon justice being shown us by the
Chinese. But we cannot expect to re
ceive equity unless we do equity.
The civil service rule has been amend
ed by providing tht where the inef
ficiency or incapacity comes within the
personal knowledge of the head of a
department the removal may be made
without notice, the reasons therefor be-
ng filed and made a record of the de
partment. . ..
Our copyright laws need revision.
The agricultural conditions of the isl
ands enforce, more strongly than ever
the argument in favor of reducing the
tariff on products of the Philippine Isl
ands entering the United States.
immediate steps should be taken for
the fortlflcation of Hawaii. This; is the
most important point in the Pacific to
fortify in order to conserve the inter
ests of this country. It would be hard
to overstate the importance of this
need. .
I earnestly advocate the adoption of
legislation which will explicitly confer
American citizenship on all citizens of
Porto Rico.
I earnestly ask that Alaska be given
an elective delegate.
I; recommend that Indian Territory
and Oklahoma be admitted as one state
and that New Mexico and Arizona be
admitted as one state. .... .
Active work- In canal construction,
mainly preparatory, has been in prog
ress for less than, a year "and a half.
During, that period two points about
the canal" have ceased to be open to
debate. ' First the question of route;
second, the questipn of feasibility. The
point which remains unsettled is wheth
er the. canal shall be one of .several
locks .above sea level or at sea level
with a single tide lock? On this point
I hope tolay before the congress at an
early .ay. the findings of the advisory
board of American and European en
gineers. y - .
In addition to'sanjtating the isthmus,
satisfactory quarters are being provid
ed for employes and an adequate sys
tem of supplying them with wholesome
food at reasonable prices -has been
created. Hospitals; have been estab
lished and equipped that are without su
periors of their kind anywhere. During
the past year a .large portion of the
plant wnn wnica ine worn is to be,
done has been on? v-
: What is needed w and without de

to meet the current and accruing cx
lenses of the commission. The first
appropriation of ?10,Q00,00Q but of the
$135,000,000 authorize by "the Spooner
act was matte three years- io. It is
nearly exhausted. Ualesj.Jie -congress
