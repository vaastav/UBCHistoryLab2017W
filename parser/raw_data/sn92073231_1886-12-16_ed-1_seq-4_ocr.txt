The Sentinel desires the name and ad
dress of every ATorth Carolinian now living tn
other States, and it earnestly asks of its read
ers to forward to us all they know of, beside
mentioning the matter to their friends, and get
ting them to do likewise. Our out-oj -State exchan
ges are respectfully requested to assist us also in
giving publicity to this paragraph. All of our
tarheel readers abroad know of many who were
formeraUy from North Carolina. Please send
their names on a postal.
We shall commence shortly send
ing out statements to those of our
subscribers who are in arrears for as
much as a year. To do this entail
upon us considerable trouble, time
( and expense. We earnestly ask our
delinquent readers to help us avoid
this by making a remittance at once.
We hope every subscriber who ia
not receipted for the present year vriU
remit something, be it great or small.
Ask yourself if you owe us anything,
and it you do, get a postal note, money
order or registered letter and forward
it to our address. A failure to remit
will force us to discontinue sending
the paper to you. We must clear our
lists of all habitual delinquents. Are
you one?
As the' time trouble and expense
required to send out statements to de
lLuquents is necessarily great, postal
cards will be used this year, instead of
envelopes and slips. " We are glad to
say that many of. out subscribers are
remitting and we hope to hear from
many more before we commence send
ing out statements.

the new publication a successful
career.
TUB PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE.
The annual communication of the
President to the Congress, which ap
peared, in part, in last issue of The
Sentinel and is concluded in this ,
is a comprehensive and exaustive
state paper. It is quite generally com
plimented by the press of the country
for its ability, wisdom, thoroughness
and decision. Its Democracy cannot
be gainsaid "and as a strong party
document, it will have good effect
among the people, who take the time
to read it carefully.
The main body of the paper is
founded upon the special inquiries
and suggestions- of the heads of the
various departments who compose
Mr. Cleveland's cabinet, showsng his
close supervision of the general funct
ions of an economical and effecient
government, and an entire harmony
oi administrative politics.
To those matters the discussion of
which pertains partieulaly to the ex
ecutive head of the -nation our 'for
eign relations, the fisheries, boundary
liues.commercial, extradition and copy
right treaties, the tariff, the coinage,
pensious, civil service and the govern
ment of the District of Columbia Mr.
Cleveland devotes a more personal
and profound attention.
His apparent leaning towards free
trade is hailed with much deliirht bv
the free trade wing of the Democracy.
Almost as important as his tariff
recommendations are the President's
views on the relations of capital and
labor.
This model message of the Presi
dent leaves the opposition press 'al
most without an opportunity to suc
cessfully criticise its political senti
ments. Last summer it was intimated that
President Cleveland had a foreign
mission in store for Gen. Cox if he
was defeated for renominations to
Congress on account of his Civil Ser
vice record. The friends of this gen
tlemen are now discussing the appro
priate fitness of the appointment by
the President of Gen. Cox to the
Turkish mission recently made va
cant by the resignation of Hon. S. S.
Cox. The Sentinel would like to
this able North Carolinian appoint
ment to this mission.
Onder the head of "A Notable
Southern Paper," the American Ad
vertiser Reporter, ot New York, is
good enough to give the following :
The Weekly Sentinel, published at
Winston, N. C, by the well known
journalist, Edward A. Oldham, is a
notable instance ot the prosperity
that is being evidenced by the South
ern newspapers. Its progress has
been marked 'and rapid. From an
obscure country weekly cf less than
400 circulation, it has become in less
than three years, a handsome South
ern weekly news and story paper of
over 4,000 circulation.
Mr. J. Chester Rockwell, one
of The Sentinel's most valued con
tributors, is about to enter the minis
try, so we see it stated in the Chad
born limes. Mr. Hockwell is a
young gentleman of pronounced poet
ical talent, whose verses have been ac
cepted and paid for by some of the
leading Northern literary periodicals
Poems from his pen have appeared at
frequent intervals in this paper. The
Sentinel extends its best wishes to
Mr. Rockwell in his new calling.
MR. KICHMOND JrKARSON an
nounces through the Asheville Ad
vance that he will in the Legislature
lead no attack upon the county gov
ernment system. He favors a plan to
allow Buncombe and other counties
in the Western part of the State to
elect their magistrates and commis
sioners, but will never, he declares.
give his voice or influence to again
put the white people of the Eastern
counties under negro influence.
Coi William . L. TERosaET,
ot
Wilmington, and who had command
of the Third North Carolina Infantry
during th war, had a short articlo ia
the December Century, concerning the
part taken . by Ripley's Brigade at
the Battle ot South Mountain. . He
testifies to the faithful set vices of the
North Carolina troops in that battle,
and does it in a condensed ' and well
written paperA

CSmriotU 'Ckromei. -
The following from the Danville
Register is to the point, and expresses
The Sentinel's views to a dot.
The editors are to blame. There
are cheap newspaper.; and cheap law
yers and doctors. People soon learn
to estimate a service by what it costs.
If newspapers would stop the abomi
nable practice of promiscuous and
gratuitous "puffing" and make peo
ple pay a fair price for their advertis
ing, they would command more re
spect and make more money out of
their investment. Newspapers do
enough gratuitous work for the pub
lic at large, without being called on
to push individuals and their private
business into prominence tor sweet
charity's sake. As for the Register
we are always ready to advance the
interest of the community we repre
sent and we never lose an opportunity
to advertise Danville and the country
round about, but when we advertise a
man's individual business, we charge
him for our services and we find all
reasonable men, willing to pay us a
reasonable fee.
Henry George's new paper will
be called The Standard, It will ap
pear January 8th and the subscript
ion price will be S2.50 per auuuiu.
For $3.00 cash we will club The
Stmdard with The Weekly Senti
nel. In his prospectus, Mr. George
says : "My purpose is to make a news
paper that while keeping abreast of
the times in all the main departments
of human thousrht and interest and
affording a field for the free discussion
of social and political topics by the
ablest writers, shall give earnest sup
port to the great movemeut that is
now beginning for the abolition of
natural rights a paper so full and
strong and fair as to meet the desires
of our friends and command thj re
spect of our opponents."
Mr. R. W. Knight, of the Hocking .
ham Rocket is winning a reputation as
a writer of interesting short stories;
besides accomplishing other literary
work. A recent member of the Ar
laiusaw Iraveller contained one of Mr.
Knight's sketches entitled "The Old
Mill at Flat Rock," the scene of which
is laid in this State. It is entertaining
and well written.
Edward Pa YSON Hall, who has
beca a frequent and valuable contrib
utor to The Sentinel, will on Janu
ary 3d next take charge of the Mt.
Airy Male Academy. His acknowl-
edged ability will be productive of
great success, anc our best wishes are
extended to Mr. Hall.
Col. Creecy, editor of the Eliza
beth City Economist is authority for
the statement that "a live and active
man in a stagnant town is first regard
ed with surprise, then with derision,
then with wonder, then jwith thought-
fulness, then with consideration and
then with admiration."
A meeting of the Board of Agri
culture has been called for January
18th to which farmers and all others
interested in the materiel welfare of
the State are invited.
Senator Maxey, ot lexas says
the Democrats should "cut loose from
Randall."

The term "better classes" inav. in the not
distant future, claim a new social definition.
The "better class" of the future will be those
who succeed by other means than the mere
accumulation of wealth. The honest, intelli
gent workmen, seeking advancement in the
social scale as a reward for duty performed, be
longs already, not to the "better class" only,
but to the best class and such a one will give
heed rather than to the voice of reason and
the dictate of conscience than to the empty
sophistry of the demagogue. Savannah Aetss.
