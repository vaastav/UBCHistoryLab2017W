POME ROY TELEGRAPH.
FRIDAY, ! Dember , 1861
i-We publish a racy little letter
from a Pomeroy boy to his father, which
nlthnurh not intended for publication
will be found tcry readable. We would
be pleased to hear from the writer by
way of regular correspondence. "What
say you, Charlie?
fSTGen. Magruder, of the rebel array,
Tra and no doubt truly, that the South-
am j i )
ern leaders are instantly advised of every
plan of the Cabinet at Washington, ana
that no power .on earth can prevent
them from getting the details of every
important movement. Ha concludes
with the emphatic declaration, that "ice
have our friends in all the Departments
at Washington, and tee know how to keep
them there!"
Troops Moving.
' . On Saturday morning last a "fleet of
steamers" passed this point, with a lieg
iment of Pennsylvania Cavaly on board,
bound, as we were informed, for Louis
ville, Ky. They were bravely cheered
as they passed, and from the heartiness
with which the greeting was returned,
"the boys" were evidently in the very
best of spirits. Success attend them in
their patriotic devotion to the cause of
their country.
Ail From Secession.
The Day Book, published at Nor
folk, Virginia, is reduced to a very de
minutive size, and ia printed on coarse
wrapping paper, about the color of a
Congo negro, after passing two genera
tions ia the family of a chivalrie F. F.
V. When the stock of wrapping paper
on hand ia exhausted, what wnhe
chivalry do?
We Won the Elephant.
Our grand fleet captured Port Royal
and no mistake! Fifty thousand men
can hold the place until the rebels get
their batteries completed, as at Sumter,
and Pickens, and Springfield, and all
along the Potomac! And fifty thousand
more can catch the rebels' negroes for
them, and keep them at work until their
batteries are done! Never mind the
expense! Walk in and see the show!
We won the elephant!
Have the Leaves Fallen.
We have been assured that the army
of 200,000 men so long lying around
Washington, would be put in motion as
toon as the leaves fell! We have had
some fine frosts here, and the forests
are as naked as the secession soldiers; but
we don't knew how it may be on the
Potomac. Perhaps the leaves have not
fallen there yet. Of course they have
not, or our army would be iu motion.
If everybody will be patient, thefrost
will reach the Virginia hill-sidos, and

BOOK, notice:.
'The "Ladles' Repository"
' For December, has been received.
This "Queen of the Monthlies" unfolds
more and more the hidden beauties of
human life. Its articles are of the high
est order "literary without being pe
dantic, religious, without bigotry" it
is especially intended for the home circle,
where the spirit of its articles will fall
"like the dew upon the tender lamb."
The varied "Editorial department," is
particularly interesting to us. The
iiigh tone and choice language link the
natural with the spiritual, in every
yhrase of life.
It is only two dollars per year 'in
variably in advance." Address Poe &
Hitchcock, Cincinnati.
Oyster.
Webster gives the following definition
to this word: "A biralvular testaceous
animal found adhering to rocks or other
jfixed substances in salt water which is
-shallow, or in the mouths of rivers.
Oysters are deemed nourishing and de
licious food."
Well,, now we think Noah might have
given a better location for finding them,
as well as the description of them.' For
instance, if he had said: They can be
found in Mayer's refreshment saloon,
ander the "Gibsoa House," ia Pomeroy;
about as big as a small calf, and as fat
fl butter." Noah never tasted such
oysters as these of Mayer's or hs would
not have said they are "deemed delicious
food." He could have added his con
victions and said they positively are "de
licious." The printers in our office all agree to
this rendering of the definition, and
vote Webster either an "old fogy," or
fin unfortunate publisher, of whom no
body thought esough of to send him a
can. Such ' is not our "fix," as Mr.
Mayer ha attended to oar "oysterial"
wants. In a week or so Mr. Mayer will
have some done up in nice shells, which
are said to render them even more pal
atable. Thanks for your favor, Mr.
Jlaycr.
Latest News.
Up to the time of our going to press
nothiDg definite has been heard from
Pickens or any other point where great
battles were being fought, or expected
soon to be.
Congress tnet on Monday, but the Pres
ident's Message was not delivered on
that day, which is the latest we have
had advices from Washington.
We anticipate some stirring scenes in
Congress as soon as it gets fairly organ
ized. Soma policy must be adopted
that will reconcile the conflicting ac
tions of our army officers. It cannot
be that every commanding officer will
be permitted to issue "general orders"
embodying his individual whims and
prejudices, rendering the whole cam
paign a scene of confusion and discord.
Better have even a bad policy than
none.
We will give a faithful abstract of
the proceedings of Congress made up
weekly to the time of going to press.
The Legislature will meet in a few
weeks. We have made arrangements
to give the spirit of the proceedings of
that body also.
JSPersons who have friends in Capt.

Very truly,
Letter from the Camp.
Elizabetiitown, Ky., Nov. 17.
Dear Father We arrived at this town
yesterday, and are encamped in a most
beautiful place, on a sloping hill-side
east of town; but I don't feel in the hu
mor to expatiate upon its beauties, be
ing somewhat "blue" to-day.
War news from near home makes me
feel like going back; and I can imagine
how the South Carolina rebel soldiers
feel while wo are bombarding thsir
homes. If Jenkins is not taken care of
soon 1 am afraid he will suddenly ap
pear before Pomeroy, and it would not
take long to shell the town; the next
news I hear ni ly be that Pomeroy has
shared the fate of Guyan lotte; but I
have confidence in the vigilance and
bravery of folks in that region, and am
not looking for any adverse news. I
suppose you have false alarms anl ex
citement, as they rule now; and I am
afraid you don't "dwell in peace at
home" very much, and will not until
Jenkins is strung up.
We expect a forward movement soon,
a3 we have a large army, and twenty or
thirty thousand more ready for us in
Indiana and Ohio. We want to winter
at Mobile, and pay Fort Sumter a visit
on our way back next spring.
I saw Gen. MuCook yestor.l.iy, and
like his looks. He is a fleshy vu m, with
a red face, and has a good-n iturel look
about him, which is wanting in military
men generally. We expect to join him
soon.
Gen. Buell weut through here to Camp
Nevin yesterday, and will review us to
morrow.
This town is the birth-place of "Abe"
Lincoln, and the house is now standing.
I will make it a visit the first opportu
nity. I think the town is about the
size of Athen3, and pretty well divided
between Union and "Secesh." It looks
like towns iu slave States usually do
everything going to rack. It may have
been a place of some life many years
ago, but the empty and crumbling brick
houses, and old rickety brick churches
and school-houses, show that activity
and progress are among the things that
were. I soppose all the go-ahead folks
have emigrated to the free States where
thuy have something to oocupy their
minds beside the nigger. All along the
road from West Point here 23 miles of
splendid pike you can hardly find a
house that would not be a disgrace to
"Devil Hole," Meigs County, although
they have any amount of land and shab
by niggers. School-houses are a con
traband institution, and the folks live
on 'possum, persimmons, and "burnt
crust" coffee. I suppose when we get
into the Union portion of the State we
will find a different state of affairs. If
we don't, it would be a blessing to di
vide the State into 160 acre lots and
give them to the soldiers.
I have got no letters in Kentucky.
The mails are probably out of order.
Direct to Louisville.
Your affectionate son,
Chaklie.
The Condition of Missouri.
Sedalia, Mo., Deo. 1.
Parties from the West say ,bat the
country between Lexington and Inde
pendence is almost deserted the men
having gone to join Price, or are at
taching themselves to the various com
mands of his officers throughout that
region.
Jennison's men are in Jackson county,
devastating the country, and several
parties of armed rebels have gone into
that section with the avowed purpose of
driving them out.
Price's proclamation has been circu
lating in the river counties about a
week, and will doubtless induce large
numbers to join the rebel army.1 My
informants say that for a distance of
about sixty miles traveled yesterday
and to-day, they met only one man on
the road.
LATEST BY TELEGARPH.
Washington, Nov. 30.
Of six hundred and forty thousand
soldiers, the estimated strength of the
army according to Secretary Cameron's
report, Illinois furnishes eighty thou
sand; Ohio, eighty-one; New York, one
hundred and one; Pennsylvania, nearly
ninety-five; Indiana, over fifty-seven
thousand. J. here are over twenty thou
sand regulars. The cavalry is nearly
sixty thousand in number and Secretary
Cameron recommends its gradual reduc
tion. Mr. Cameron also recommends
the abrogation of all distinctions be
tween regulars and volunteers.
A letter from Poolesville, Md., dated
on the 28th, says: Yesterday a deserter
came over from the Mississippi iwenty
first, at the risk of his life. Others of
the same regiment and company im
plored the officer bearing a flag of truce
to bring them over with him. Of
course he could not make such a use of
the white flag. It is represented that
many of the regiments wish to leave.
The reasons given are their neglect
when sick and the want of proper food.
The total force in the vicinity of Lees
burg fit for duty ia represented about
two thousand six hundred. Of the sick
there are six to eight hundred. Two
Irish companies ill the Mississippi
Twenty-first are greatly dissatisfied.
There are no troops between Manassas
Junction, Goose Creek and the Great
Spring road.
Dispatches from Gen. Stone corrobor
ate all the above statements.
The' Norfolk Day Boole, of the 22J,
says the following is a copy of an offi
cial dispatch, dated
O'Bannonsville, near Pensacola, )
1 o'clock, Monday, Nov. 25.
The enemy seems satisfied, as he
doesn't reopen his fire. They have
fired into our hospital, but my sick had
all been removed. Many hot shot and
innumerable shell were thrown into the
Navy Yard, with comparatively little
damage. Signed
Braxton Bragg.
The official dispatches of Sunday
night say both the Federal ships re
tired crippled. This was all the dam
age done the enemy. Our wounded are
only slightly hurt, and doing well.
This is the latest from Pensacola.
The issue of treasury notes is sus
pended for the present, fifty millions
having been put forth.
Ten millions of cartridges were served
the troops of the Potomac army between
the first July and the first of November.
A son of Henry Ward Beecher was
appointed second lieutenant of the
Fourth Artillery to-day.
Washington, Dec. 1.
A single sentence in Secretary Welles'
report -embodies much wisdom on the
subjet of fugitives who seek refuge on
United States vessels. If in complicity
with the rebellion they should be deliv
ered to the custody of the Government,
if not voluntarily so, they should be
employed by the navy, and when the
necessities of its services are supplied
by the army, when enough are received
for that service also, they should bo al
lowed to go free.
Secretary Welles compliments Capt.
Wilkes for his energy in seizing Mason
and Slidell, and excuses him on account
of patriotic motives for not capturing
the vessel also, but declares his course
in the later point not to constitute a
precedent.
Besides the seventy-six vessels of the
old navy, oue hundred aud fifty-six
have beeu added by purchase and thirty-two
by construction.
Two schooners from Baltimore, one
loaded with coal, the other with lumber,
were captured by the rebel steamer
George Paige, last Thursday night, when
becalmed opposite the Potomac batter
ies. The George Paige passed within
one hundred yards of our pickets,
which it deceived, representing itself as
a United Utates vessel. The Paige is
unable to catch vessels sailing with a
tolerable breeze.
A spy just from Richmond brings
important information. There is great
fright there in consequence of the mili
tary and naval expeditions. The Geor
gia aud South Carolina regiments are
discontented, and only appeased by Jeff.
Davis' promise that enough troops
should be sent to their homes to drive
the Yankees into the sea.
Preparations are making for the re
moval of the rebel capital, greatly to
the rage of Virginia, which Jeff. Davis
threatens to leave to its fate, under the
plea that it costs more than it comes to
to support the army there.
There is uo doubt of a quorum to
morrow in both Houses. Bright is
here, and Vallandigham, and both the
Oregon and California Senators. The
message will be about the length of that
at the extra session.
The rebel pickets along the Potomac
lines have recently advanced. Vienna,
hitherto occupied by our troops, is now
occupied by them to-day. Flint Hill is
in their possession.
In Congress a movement will be made
toward the abolition of slavery in the
District of Columbia. The Maryland
Legislature will probably pass an act of
gradual emancipation after the receipt
of Cameron s bribe of Lastern Virginia.
In the Leonardstown Postoffice were
found letters from Richmond and
Charleston to a British Uouse, repre
sented in the Northern cities, advising
them as to the best way of running the
blockades. Tampieo and the savannah
river, now closed are favorite routes.
Washington, Dec. 2.
congressional.
H ouse. All the Illinois members
answered to their names except Logan.
Richardson took an active part in the
business, whence it is inferred he does
not accept the Brigadier Generalship.
Messrs. Segar of Virginia, and Foster of
.North Carolina, will probably not be ad
mitted. Colfax's resolution confining
Mason in a felon's cell until the rebels
treat Col. Corcoran differently, and dea
ceutly, was received with applause from
the galleries.
Frank Blair, Conway, Campbell, Mc-
Pherson, Rice of Mass., and many others
voted to lay Eliot's emancipation reso
lution on the table, considering it ill
timed coming before the President's
message. Others objected to the phrase
ology, preferring a confiscation resolu
lution. It nevertheless had fourteen
majority.
Conkling's resolution of inquiry con
cerning Ball's Bluff occasioned a sensa
tion. Senator Trumbull's proposed bill
tor the confiscation of all rebel property,
including slaves, is generally com
mended. important from the south.
The Richmond Examiner of Friday
contains an elaborate leading article, in
sisting that the South must raise five hun
dred thousand men by conscription, on the
plan of European States if it would fight
the united North with fair prospect of
success. The article points out the dis
advantages of all volunteer and niiJItia
systems, and emphatically deckres- the
North united more and more thoronghly
by every defeat and sacrifice, and bow
has a regular army of five hundred thou
sand. The Examiner publishes a telegram
from Savannah, stating that Fort Pu
laski had opened fire on Tybee Island,
and driven the Federals to another point;
and one from Charleston announcing
that the Northern troops have entire
possession of St. Helena Island, had
landed at the mouth of Ashpoor river,
on the northern side of St. Helena
Sound, and had attempted to land near
Buckingham, but were driven on.
The Montgomery Advertiser gives a
list of seven killed and four wounded,
including a Colonel in one of the Mis
sissippi regiments, engaged at Fort

The War Department will soon issue
orders forbidding the Governors of
States to raise any more batteries or
regiments, except upon special requisi
tion of the War Department.
A General Superintendent of Volun
teers is to be appointed to take charge
of the reruiting service, who shall be a

No more cavalry will be accepted.
Men in incomplete regiments are to be

Jim Lane was serenaded to night.
He was introduced by Owen Lovejoy.
He reiterated his intention to march to
crush out treason and let Slavery tako

and was heartily applauded.
Important from the South.
New York, Dee. 1. The Richmond
Dispatch of the 28th says Congress yes
terday passed a law admitting Missouri
into the Southern Confederacy. Con
gress refused to make advance on or pur
chase produce of the planters.
Ihe Legislature of Mississippi passed
bills authorizing the Governor to call
out an optional number of volunteers for
service at Columbus, and appropriating
500,000 therefor.
The Galveston Citizen reports the cap-
tare of the pirate Royal Yacht by the
Federal steamer Santee. All the crew
are prisoners.
The Charleston Courier of the 26th
reports the landing of the Federal troops
at Buckingham, on the main land. The
rebel forces had made' a forward move
ment.
The Richmond Dispatch has a tele
gram dated Savannah the 27th, saying
that Commodore Tatnall, with 3 small
steamers, attacked the Federal fleet in
Cockspur roads yesterday. The engage
ment lasted an hour. About 50 shots
were fired. None on our side injured.
On failing to draw the Federal fleet
under the guns of Fort Pulaski, Tatnall
withdrew.
It is reported the Yankees have taken
Warsaw, and are preparing to attack
Pulaski.
It is reported that the ship Ilarvcy
