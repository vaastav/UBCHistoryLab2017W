of the several sugg? ' 'I plans and his
t.u *i \ lew .is to the best maimer of

j.ati-h yesterday. Mr. Wilgus roa'his
tlie conclusion that the Hankins plan,
providing for a deep depr ?ssion (if the
Pelt, IJne, is iinm < .ui'.y drastic and
otherwise objectionable. ar.'l that the
? b-vati-d ?r.I; plan prope-ed by Kngl

With suy U'-stloris of his own, de

"That this smaller clearance is ample
for the passage of equipment is evi
denced by the regulation loadings of
the railroads of the United States,
which usually range from thirteen to
fourteen feet," r^oris Mr. \V ilgus.
"As to the protection of employees, the
prohibition of their presence on the
tops of cats within this zone, except
under certain conditions, would remove
all cause of danger.
"The reduction ill clear height from
twenty-one to sixteen feet, the thinning
of the bridge Moors to two feet instead
of three, as now proposed, and the fur
ther lowering of the tracks a foot or
two. coupled with the deepening of the
drainage courses 011 the north, would
effect a lessening in the street raisings
of seven or eight feet, tints making the
lift at Monument Avenue four or live
f.-.-t, instead of twelve f.-.-t, as planned "
Mr. Will;us suggests the adoption of
arch in the place of the trestle type of
bridge suggested in the several plans
that have been advanced, as better de
signed to harmonize with the pnrklike
development of the \Ve?t I.ml. While
the cost of the arch structure would be
somewhat greater than that of the
utilitarian trestle bridge, the advan
tages, from an esthetic point of view,
I 0 believes, would more than justify it.

P.v utilizing the material from the
railroad excavation, it would he pos
sible, Mr. Wilgus thinks, with the con
sent of the a Ijacent land owners, to
lid the entire adjoining surface for
the full height at the right-of-way
lines, and to slope off for l.">0 to 200
f.et each way in such manner as to
create a natural undulation or rise in
the country.
"That a moderate swell in the sur
face tiiutht be a distinct attraction and
serve to break the monotony of a tlat
expanse." says the engineer, "may lie i
seen b\ noting the-happy effect that <
lias been obtained on Monument Avenue J
!?v placing the statues of I and Davis
on slight eminences, where their
silhouettes against the sky and the
mvstery of what lies beyond greatly ;
enhance the beauty of the avenue.
"It should he added that the sodding
of the sides of the railroad cut, the j
under-draining and paving of tho [
ditches and the cultivation of vines to
clothe the bridges will go far to make
the entire improvement a pleasing one."

After Hiving some of the facts Aus
t r ia -11 u iif;a ry desires, particular atten
tion is called to the statement issued
bv the A list ro-11 unua ria n admiralty.
The note will, it was said, virt'iiills
state that 111 ?? principal complaint of
the United States is based upon lie
admissions contained in the admiralty i
statement which admitted that the An
1-011:1 was torpedoed by the submarine,
while persons were still aboard.
All the demands made in the Jirst
note will be reiterated, and it is be
lieved no room will be left for further
arguments or negotiations. The note!
will not. it was authoritatively staled,
lix a time limit within which Austria
Hungary must comply with the Ameri
can demands, but will make it clear
that the filial word of this government
has been spoken, and that Austria
Hungary must decide promptly by its
actions whether diplomatic, relations
between the two countries shall be
severed.
While ilrr.t in tone, the communica
tion, it is believed, will not be unite as
vigorous as the first note. The United
States was reported by officials as de
sirous of continuing its present rcla- t
tions with Austria-Hungary should It .

Their lenders are declared in some I
quarters to anticipate a Unitarian as

Advices roga tiling the plans of thei
central powers are decidedly conflict

however, claim that their Herzegovina
army has given the Awstrians a set

recent similar ones, which have been

Shortly after 10 o'clock the President
and Mrs. Wilson entered a waiting
White House automobile and motored
to Alexandria. Va., across the Potomac,
to take their private car there, and
avoid the crowd at the railroud station
in this city.
President Wilscli arrived at Mrs.
Malt's home shortly after S o'clock,
about a half-hour before the time for
Mw ceremony. The small crowd which
had gathered did not notice the ar
"\al oi his car, and he entered prac
tical^ unnoticed. The remainder of
the wedding party from the Whit*
Mouse arrived soon afterward.
I he President dined, as usual, at th*
White Mouse at 7 ..'clock with his
daughters and afterward drove to his
bride's home, about a mile from tho
executive mansion. A cold, driving
rain which swept the city all day
cleared off at sunset, and the evening
?'?'us cool and pleasant.
I- \ erytking was in readiness when
Mie President arrived, and the ceremony
proceeded without music. Neither tho
President nor Mrs. Malt had any at
tendants. and there were no ushers or
Hover Kirls. Neither the army, tho
navy nor the diplomatic corps was rep
resented. the occasion being what b th
of the couple had wished it to be a
