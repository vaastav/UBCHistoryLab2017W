CURIOUS BITS OF HISTORY.
By A. W. MC.
THE DISCOVERY OK AFRICAN
DIAMONDS
The children of a poor farmer
who lived on the banks of the
Orang River, near Hopetown. In
South Africa, had no artificial
playthings, so they were accus
tomed to pick up and bring into
thc house the beautifully colored
pebbles they found along the
edge of the river. One day In
1867 one of the children found tt
little white stone and brought It
In and dropped It with other peb
bles on the floor. It sparkled so
that it attracted the attention of
the mother, who mentioned It to
a man named Van Nlekerk. The
stone was found and he offered
to pay her for it. She laughed at
the idea, but he had a vague no
tion that It might be valuable.
He put it Into the hands of a
traveling trader named O RelUey,
who had It examined by an ex
pert and It was found, to be worth
12,000. Thus was the great Klm
berly diamond field discovered.

RAGTIME
HYMNS.
Uncle Walt Says To-day:
Sundry highbrows are denouncing ragtime hymns the people
sing; after getting such a trouncing they will fade like cverj thing!
All our anthems should be stately, so the angry high
brows shriek; but it seems to me they're greatly off
their trolley, so to speak. Underneath the roof and
steeple, where the hymnbook music rolls, there are
divers kinds of people, all varieties of souls. Some prefer a solemn
measure, grand, majestic, noble, strong ; others get a greater pleas
ure from the slap-bang kind of song. Let the hymn be swift and
swinging if some lifting thought it starts; what's the odds what
hymn we're singing if it moves the people's hearts? Let who will
go worship Milton and his harp that flashes fire ; let who will pre
fer the liltin' of a joyous ragtime lyre ! Walt Mason.
