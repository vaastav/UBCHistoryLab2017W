OWNED BY JACKSON PEOPLE.
The stock of the Amador County Publishing Company,
heretofore held by D. Gutmann and others of San Francisco,
has been purchased by Jackson people, the editor of the
Ledger being one of them. The Ledger is, therefore,
owned and controlled by men able, capable and desirous of
increasing its power for good in this community. Many
necessary and important changes for the betterment of the
paper are in contemplation.
CONDEMNED BY THEIR OWN ORGAN.
•' The arbitrary action of the Democratic majority of the
Board of Supervisors at the last 'meeting is censured by the
lone "Echo," their own organ, as follows:
[>■ " POOR DEMOCRACY. "
" The action of the Democratic members of the
Board of Supervisors at this month's meeting, the
first of the week, was, to speak with as much charity
as possible, very extraordinary and high handed.
Dr. Endicott, county physician and health officer,
and R. F. Allen, county hospital superintendent,
tendered their resignations to the Board, to take
effect on or before the 15th of December, instead of
at the next regular meeting of the Board.
"Be it remembered that the terms of Dwyer and
Clifton, Democrats, and Brinn, Republican, will ex-' .-. ./.
pire on January 7th, twenty-three days after the res
ignations were timed to take effect. The Republican
members of the Board opposed the acceptance of the
resignations as they were and suggested that the of
ficers tendering them be asked to substitute January
7 for December 15, as the date in the resignations.
This would protect the resigners against being 'kick
ed out,' and would also show the good intent of the
retiring Board and resigning officers to the incoming
Board, and leave the selection of their successors to
the new Beard which will organize on January 7th —
their rightful prerogative.
"The resignations were- accepted, however, by
the following vote:
"Ayes— Dwyer, Clifton, McLaughlin, Denio
" Noes — Brinn,- LeMoin, Republicans.
■ "Then LeMoin made the same motion which was
•59? defeated by the Democratic members of the Board at .
the June meeting, after being laid over from the May
session—that the office of health officer be abolished,
and the Democratic members showed their full
change of heart since that 'necessary' office has
passed into the hands of the Republicans, by voting
to abolish it." q%
CALIFORNIA PRESS ASSOCIATION.
In San Francisco, Dec. n, 1900, the annual meeting of
the California Press Association was held in the assembly
room of the Press Club. Representatives were present from
nearly every section of the State. The session was of un
usual interest. An excursion of the Association to New
Orleans, to take place in February next, was planned. Of-
W. D. Pennycook, Vallejo, President, S. M. Haskell,
Pomona, vice-President, Raleigh Barcar, Vacaville, Secretary,
G. M. Francis, Napa, Treasurer. Executive Committee:
E. B. Willis, Sacramento, J. F. Thompson, Eureka, Duncan
McPherson, Santa Cruz, F. D. Mackinder, St. Helena, A. B.
Lemmon, Santa Rosa, F. H. Owen, Winters, T. G. Daniels,

mittee. '■■ .*.
EVERY DOLLAR EQUIVALENT TO GOLD.
"The party in power is committed to such legislation as
will better, make the currency responsive to the varying needs
of business at all seasons and in all sections," says President
McKinley in his message. Yes, and every dollar will be
equivalent to gold. •? .v. v
. vThe Isthmian Canal Commission in its report submitted
to the President and by him to Congress, states that "the
most practicable and feasible route for an isthmian canal
under the control, management and ownership of the United
States, is that known as the Nicaragua route. The com
mission estimates the cost of this; route at $200,540,000, be
ing much in excess of any heretofore made, but it is due to
increased dimensions and other features not heretofore con
sidered. The commission also estimates the cost of a canal
by the Panama route at $142,342,579, according to one route,
or $156,378,258 according to another route. As between the
Nicaragua and Panama route, the commission sums up a
number of advantages favorable to the former."
REFERRING to the Chinese trouble, President McKinley
says, in his message: "Due compensation may be made in
part by increased guarantees of security for foreign rights
and immunities, and, most important of all, by the opening
of China to the equal commerce of the world." Military con
trol of the Philippines, he points out, is imperative until the
rebellion is ended. Civil government, meanwhile, is to be
organized by the commission in the larger administrative di
visions of the islands, as far as this can be safely done.
The Water and Forest Convention, in session at San
Francisco, is one of intense interest to the people of the State,
and its deliberations will be awaited with interest.

RULING ON LIEN LAW.
Judge Belcher, of Ban Francisco, Makes
an Important Decision.
In the Superior Court of San Fran
cisco Judge Belcher filed an opinion
last Monday, that will come as a sur
prise to the legal fraternity. The ef
fect of the decision is to virtually de
clare unconstitutional Section 1194 of
the Code of Civil Procedure which re
lates to mechanic's lions. The opinion
sets aside the practice of years, and if
sustained by the Supreme Court will
make quite a difference in future pro
cedure.
The section in question provides for
the rank of liens against property in
the following order:
1. All persons performing manual
labor in, on or about the same.
2. Persons furnishing materials.
3. Sub-contractors.
4. Original contractors.
And in case property Is sold to satisfy
liens the proceeds must be applied in
that order, inslead of pro rata.
In the case at bar several lien holders
embracing the classes given adove, had
consolidated their suits, in order to
test the validity of the law. In ren
dering- his opinion Judge Belcher said :
"In this consolidated case the first
and second classes would take all of the
fund, leaving nothing for the third and
fourth class if the statute must be fol
lowed. Certain of the lien claimants
contended that the section is uncon
stitutional, and in my estimation that
contention Is sound.
The Constitution provides (Art. XX,
Sec. 15) that: "Mechanics, material
men, artisans and laborers of every
class shall have a lien upon the prop
erty upon which they have bestowed
labor or furnished materials, for the
value of such labor done ani materials
furnished, and the Legislature shall
provide by law for the speedy and
efficient enforcement of all such liens.".
By this constitutional provision a
direct lien is given to mechanics,
material men, artisans and laborers,
and nothing is left to the Legislature
save the duty of enacting measures for
the enforcement of the liens given.
The Legislature was not authorized to
declare which of these classes, to the
exclusion of the others, should be paid.
To the contrary, the Legislature was
given power, or rather it was directed
to provide by law for the "speedy and
adequate enforcement' 1 of the liens al
ready given. By the Constitution the
liens of all the classes mentioned stand
upon the same plane— are equal before
the law, and the Legislature had no
power to enact that one class should be
paid In preference to another,' It fol
lows that Sec. 1194, C. O. P., is uncon
stitutional to the extent that it at
tempts to create preferred classes of
lien claimants.
The constitutional protection is ex
tended to "mechanics,* material men,
artisans and laborers of every class."
These protected classes do not embrace
contractors or sub-contractors. Aeon
tractor or sub-contractor, might chance
to be skilled in the practice of some
mechanic art,' but his contract or sub
contract would not necessarily call for
the display of mechanical ability, and
therefore I do not see how either could
be said to be embraced within the
denomination ' 'mechanics. ' ' Certainly
they are not embraced within either of
the other three classes. A corporation
might be a contractor or sub-con
tractor, but, clearly, a corporation, in
this particular, is not within the. con
stitutional intendment. In my-judg
ment, therefore, theliens of contractors
or sub-contractors must depend upon
the force and effect of the general law.
All the lien claimants proved their
claims, or they were admitted, and
they are to be treated with perfect
