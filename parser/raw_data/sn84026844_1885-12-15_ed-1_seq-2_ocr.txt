"The government telegraph system,"
says the Pittsburgh Ditpiuch. "can be sue- |

under it can be kept out of politics. How I
soon that millennial stale of affairs is I
likely to come, is a question which every
man may answer for himself." Under the
"offensive partisan" ruling the expertnees I
and faithfuJueas of an operator would be
no protection. It is very doubtful whether |
we are yet ready for a government telegraph
in this country. Mr. Gould saya he ,
is done buying telegraph lines. Mr. Gar-I

FaaUur'a Hydrophobic Trautmenl.
Pasteur's experiments on rabbits, doga
and monkeys, have attracted the attention,
not only of scientists, but of the intelligent
world in general. They are likely to command
even greater notice as they take
the practical and higher form of cures for
IlUman ueuigB. xuicura uoamiuub ui
hydrophobia by inoculation, if it be all
that is aaid of it, will confer upon mankind
a priceleia benefit. The old remedy
of killing tho dog maf still be insisted
upon as a ueoceasary part of the treatment,
for superstitions pass away slowly;
but this will be of little moment if also
the patient be inoculated with hydrophobia
virus and his life saved.
A newspaper correspondent who called
on the eminent scientist to see whether
he would accept for treatment the three
children of Newark, New Jersey, who
have since been forwarded to him, gives a
very interesting account of his operations.
While he was in tho labofatory a Russian
officsr, who had been kitten by a bound,
came with hla phyaiciin, havfbg made the
journey Irom Russia to try the treatment.
I'asteur inoculated the Itussiao in the
atommch vith hydrophobia virus, instructed
him to lift u uiual, divert himself as
he choae, and come every morning for inoculation.
At the time of the correspondent's
iait I'aateur said he had seventy-three
cases under treatment, the ages of the patieots
ranging from four months to sixty
years; they were all doing well and the
treatment had not failod in any case.
Speaking of the Newark children, M.
Pasteur said he would bo through with
them in about a fortnight alter they are
placed In his charge, adding that "for over
a year to come they may get bitten by as
many mad dogs as they plesse with perfect
impunity".
Jle suggests that there ought to ba la
this country a general hydrophobia hospital
to which could be sent patients frdm
the whole continent of North America.
If at last a* cure haa been discovered for
thia terrible disease the world will owe to
the patient man wjio has discovered it a
debt which all the generations to come
can not pay.
Th? Ohio Trouble.
By the decision of the Supreme Court of
Ohio in the Hamilton county cases the
Republican majority on joint ballot is reduced
to three?a dangerously narrow
margin in view of the desperate efforts to
defeat Senator Sherman.
There is promise of infinite trouble in
the Senate, which under the ruling of the
court will contain twenty Democrats and
seventeen Republicans. If the four Senators
whose seats ore contested follow custom
and refrain from voting on their own
cases, the vote would be seventeen Republicans
to sixteen Democrats, and the
Democrats would lose their seats. Nothing
in the game of fraud warrants the expectation
that the Hamilton county pretenders
will be bo delicate as to follow
Drccedent and refuse to vote for them
selves.
Tho moit serious feature of tbo case is
the degradation of the Supreme Court ol
Ohio. The fraud was manifest, but that
tribunal declined to see it. If courts are
to become the servants of partisan di<tatora
tho people will be helpless to piotect
themselves until they rise strong
enough to put honest men on the bonch.
If thu political life of Ohio i? to be detiled
by the desperadoes of Cincinnati,
nothing i3 more certain than that we shall
in time see another outbreak in that
wretched city. When combustible materials
and lighted torches aro in close
proximity there is a thing which is very
likely to happen.

A Torrlblo Kxplualun or ailuo Damp-Many
Injured.
WiLKKsiiAKiix, Pa., Dec. 14.?A frightful
explosion of gas took place this morning
.in the Mill Creek mine, operated by
tho Delaware it Hudson Coal .Company.
At the time of the accident there were
about one hundred miners, laborers and
boys in the slope. The news spread rapidly,
and tho whole population seemed to
have gathered about the colliery. The
explosion occurred in what it known as
No. 12 lift, which is located at the extreme
end of the opening of the slope, being four
thousand feet from the mouth, and, therefore,
its ventilation was a difficult problem.
The gas had ignited in the breast,
where a miner named Coffey was at work.
An exploring party ol some twenty
miners entered the slope as aodn as the
news had reached the surface. It was
soon discovered that many had been
buried aud they at once began removing
them. Amongthoso seriously injured are
Geo. Martin, miner; John Cleasby, laborer;
Nichols Gray, driver boy; Peter Coffey,
miner; Saul Morris, laboier; Joseph
Pardusk, driver, and Peter Stone, laborer.
Since writing the above Martin has died.
Many others are injured more or less from
flying pieces of coal and wood.
Joseph L. Cleaaby in badly burned and
his skull is fractured. He cannot survive.
Peter Cofl'ey is seriously burned on the
face and nrms aud is internally injured.
He will die. Joseph Pardncke is dangerously
injured. He was brought to the
surface naked, his clothing having been
burned from his body. His recovery is
considered doubtful. Nicholas Gray, the
driver b^ had his right eye torn from its
socket.

Burlington, N. J., Dec. 14.?Despatches
from St. Louis announce that A. D. Campbell,

years in jail for bigamy, turning Catholic
in prison, and was made superintendent
of the Sunday School. When he got out his
tirst wife was divorced, and his second one
wouldn't live with him. He was sent by
the Catholics to Australia, where he deserted
the Church had opened a billiard
hall and dramshop, which failed, and he

this with a life of dissipation, which he
abandoned to marry an estimable young
woman, who, however, fouud hitn out before
the ceremony was performed, and he
had to sail for England, whence no came
to America in 1882. The Burlington episode

went to St. Charier, where he has just
[ been exposed.

WisiiiNCJTo.v, D. C, Dec. 14.?Secretary
Bayard Is said to be in a quandary as to
what he had better do with the appointment
of Bay leas W. Hanna aa Minister to
ibe Argentino Republic. The trouble with
Hanua is that be is not such a man as
Mr. Bayard wants in the diplomatic service,
even to represent a Democratic administration.
He has been writing a let

Fitzhugb, of the house of

nimself as "a bigger man than old Grant."
The new^Miriteter is not the most cultured
man that the administration could find,
and his rariations from if hat is considered
rfood form in this respect has created a
prejudice against him in the Department
of State.
The nomination was not sent to the
Senate the other day with the larue batch
of diplomatic appointments, and it is a
question whether or not it will be; but
senator VoorheeH, whose real has fastened
upon tho administration one or two others
which have not added credit to tho same,
is making every eflbrt to have lianna's

\VAflni!TOTo.s,D.C.,Dec. 14.?The House
Oommitteo on Rules in submitting the
proposed new code of rules for the House
accompanies it willia report explauatoiy
of its provisions. Alter naming the general
appropriation bills that would, under
the rules as amended be referred to committees
other than tho Committee on Appropriations,
the Legislative, Executive
and Judicial, the Sundry Civil, the Defic
iency, Fortification, the Pension and the
District of Columbia Appropriation Bills.
These bills include more than half the annual
appprooriations for carrying on the
Government.
'JLae committee is of the opinion that
the general appropriation bills should be
conllued strictly to items and matter* of
appropriation, authorized by existing law
to the continuation of appropriations for
such public works as are already in progress
and for the contingencies for carrying
on the several departments of the
government, and to this end recommend
the restriction of the old rule adopted by
the Twenty-fifth Congress, and which
stood without amendment until the Fortyfourth
Congress, a period of nearly forty
years, and was further amended in the
Forty-sixth Congress.
The committee believes that tho distribution
of the appropriation bills and prohibition
of general legislation thereon
will more oveulv distribute the burden
and responsibility of committee work, and
will avoid heated controversies and pro
longod conference between the independent
branches of government.
8IL.VKR COIN AUK AND T11B SOUTH.
Strong Groanda Taken Cor and Against tfc?
Standard Dollar.
Washington, Dec. 14.?Congressman
Hemphill, of South Carolina, takes strong
grounds against the continued coinage o(
the standard dollar. In this respect his
action is eomewhat significant, as the
Southern men havo been counted on by
the silver advocates, who claim the West
and South against the East. Mr. Iiemp*
hill says there is certain danger in continued
coinage, and when tho crisis comes
the South will find itself in posession oi
most of the country, which it has taken in
exchange for its produo's. Then tho dollar
which paid for one hundred cents
worth of material will purchase but eighty
cents' worth, and the South will suffer
itreat lQifl. , . n
Other Southern members are not so outspoken
in their views. Attempts were
made to-day to canvass a number of Southern
and Western delegations in regard to
their votes on suspending the coinage of
silver. The number of members who
were non-committal was surprising. Some
confessed they did not understand the
snbject in all its bearings, while others
did not care to say how they would vote.
Those who leaned in favor of continued
silver coinage, however, were in the majority.

lileaa Condemned?'The Abolition of
tbo Internal Kevenne Taw.
Washington, Dec. 14.?Judge Kelley's
feelings in relation to the President's message
are somewhat mixed. He is pleased
with the attitude the President took in relation
to treaties. . "Referring to the message
exclusively of all other considerations,"
he said, "I find myself much
nearer to President Cleveland than I did to
President Arthur, and his secretaries of
state and treasury, To make entangling
alliances with foreign nations and to arrogate
to the Executive the control of sub
jseuj conuueu vy me iiunauiuuon 10 umj
popular branch of Coagress for origin and
inception, became an over-mastering pasbiou
with President Arthur and Secretary
Frelinghuysen, who found an able ally in
that direction in the last of Mr. Arthur's
Secretaries of the Treasury, that venerable
free-trader, Hugh McCullflch."
Continuing, the Judge said: "President
Cleveland tells us that he withdrew their
treaty with Nicaragua for the construction
by and at the sole cost of the United States
of a canal through Nicaraguan territory,
and adds that attentive consideration ol
ita provisions leads him to withhold it
from eubmission to the Senate. He prefers
to maintain the tenets of a line of
precedents from Washington's day, which
proacribe entangling alliances with foreign
ltates,' to the adoption of tho vagaries
of his immediate predecessor."
TWO rOLIC'lBS CONTRASTED,
Taking up the message, and adjust
ing his gold spectacles, Judge Kelley
pointed to the following paragraph of the
message, remarking as lie did so: ''The
contrast between the two policiea ia finely
emphasized there, and I beg of you to
quote the paragraph in full."
"Our duty in the present instruct* us to
address ourselves mainly to the develop
ment of the vast reuourcea of the great
area committed to our charge, and to the
cultivation of the arts of peace within our
owu border*, though jealousy is alert in
preventing the American hemisphere
lrom being involved iu the political problems
and complication* of distant governments.
Therefore, I am unablo to recommend
propositions iuvolving paramount
privileges of owneiship or right outside ol
our own territory, when coupled with absolute
and unlimited engagements to defend
tho territorial integrity of tbe State
where auch interests lie."
"There ia but one of thenumerousbrood
of treaties negotiated under the auspices
of Mr. Arthur which President Cleveland
ia willing to recoguize, that with Mexico,
of which he makes an exception because it
had-received thuaafent of the Senate."
"How do the President'* views on the
Ailver anasLion conform with vnura?" I
inquired.
-1 cannot accept all or the greater part
of wliat the President says on tbo silver
ijaefltion and think he greatly exaggerate?
me dangers of the situation."
TilJB TARIFF I88UK.
"What do you think of his expressions
on tho tariff?"
"On the tariff I question his statement
that tho proposition with which we have
to deal is the reduction of the revenue rereived
by the Government, and indirectly
paid by the people, from custom duties.
Why from custom duties? Tho thoory is
we should abolish war taxes. They are
not war taxes. The second act to which
Washington attached his signature as
President was a tariff bill, and wo have
aever in peace or in war been without a
lystem of custom duties, from which often
n peace wo derived our revenue almost
ixclusvvoly, and which were the chief
lource of revenue during the war of 1812,
he Mexican war and that for the supsression
of the rebellion. ,
"Internal taxes are war taxes. They ,
nrere resorted to as a means of assisting in
ho reduction of the debt ontailod by the
evolutionary war. The attempt to coltliurn
i n voKnllinn tsliiiili
:aused tbe expenditure of nearly one-half
he result derived from them and the
naintenance of an army in Western Pennlylvania
for the enforcement of their colection.
Jefl'ergon denounced the system
is diabolical and said it threatened the inegrity
of the Union. Tno fifth year witlessed
their abolition. Internal taxes
vero agaiu resorted to pending the war
vith Great Britain and were again repealid
at the end of four years. Tho existing
lystem of internal taxes eerves as a foeble
eminder only of tho vast system that 1
vas called into existence through
he magnitude of the war for the
luppression of the rebellion. At one
ime the system was bo inquisitorial as to 1
je almost unendurable, and yielded in a
tingle year more than live times the
imount collected last year from the rem* l
lanta of the system which still 'discredits
he wisdom of recent legislation. Again 1
18k why must any reduction of the revemo
that is to be made be eflected by a re- 1
iuction of the customs duties rather than I
>y the internal taxes, which are a burden
jpon every farmer who grows tobacco,
ind every crippled soldier and soldier's
inaow, who, but lor the taxea on cigars
ind the restraints which prohibit poor
people from engaging in cigar making,
night earn money aa they did beforo the
abacco taxea wore imposed.
"The President did not content himself
with the expression 1 am controverting, 1
jut again said: 'Within these limitations 1
i certain reduction should be made in our
customs revenue.' On this point I take
ssuo with him, and say in behalf of the
abor of the country, which he tells us is
,he capital of our workingmen, the re- i
luction should be made from the internal |
axes, especially aa those on tobacco re- ,
itrain the range pf employment for crip- ,
ilea, women t>nd children and add hunlreds
of percent to tho cost of the one luxiry,
nocessary perhapp I ought tQ of .
he great rpaw of Amoriean workingmen." .
Judge Kelley is evidently inclined to <
reat the Democratic President with the <
itmoet fairness, lie praises his good rec- ,
immendations, hut denounces those which ,
ire misconceived.

Reported Failure That Tnrna Oat TalM*
Gould's Position.
4vjtvr Yobk, Dec. 14.?The Sun of thii
morning uyi: "It appears thai the publication
of the President's message and of
Mr. Vandeibilt's will did not furnish suliicient
occupation for the Wall street gossip-mongers,
who consequently invented
a sensational story about the failure of
Washington E. Connor, and some serious
financial difficulties which he had had
with Jay Gould. Of course there was not
a word of truth in the whole story, and
those who invented it took advantage of
Connor's absence from the city to give it
the widest possible circulation. The
writer has the best authority for stating
that the relations of Mr. Gould aud Mr.
Connor have never been better than they
aro to-day. Mr. Connor has not made any
money lately, but he has not lost any.
He didn't join the Vanderbilt-Morgan
July movement, because he did not believe
there was eatficient foundation for
it, and was thoroughly posted in regard
tn the attitude of Mr. Gould.
"Jay Geuld long ago made np bis mind
I to quit active speculation. He majr change
1 his mind further on, but tbere ia no indication
of it at preeent. He ia going,
I about Christmaa, on a cruiee, to be abaent
[several montha. Hia son, George, ia
going to take bia place in different companiea
concentrated in the Western Union
building, and it ia hia father'a intention to
1 give him ao much work that he will not
nave time to go to wall street. All the
reporta to the contrary notwithstanding,
[young Gould ia not going into partnership
either with White Fearaall, an
I anonymous friend of Wm. K. Vanderbilt,
| or anvbody else."
"Washington E. Conner, on the other
hand, is going into partnership with his
brother, and ia going to continue buaineaa
with his present ataffofdorkaand brokers.
Morosini will probably be compelled to
go out of buaineaa altogether, the health
of hia wife being in a very critical condi
tion, and lie himself requiring rest.

Inhuman Treatment tu Whteh Farmed.Out
I'aupera WereSabJeoted.
Kumill, Mass., Dec. 14.?For many
months there have been rumors afloat ol
cruel treatment of the town paupers bj
Keeper Chapman, who has for ihreo year*
bid off the town's poor at an average of
about eeventy-flve dollars a year for each
pauper. The Selectmen have persistently
denied tho rumors.
Two officers of the State Board of Health,
Lunacy and Charity have just completed
an investigation. Some of the details of
their report are too revolting for publication.
The inspectors found filth abounding
and stenches too loathsome for
human endurance. Not a few of the
inmates had for beds nothing but a
pillow of husks upon the floor, and
for covering onlv old clothing. Upon
snch a bed an agod man namecLThompson

od him was uncooked corn meal, mixed
with water. Starvation, rather than
disease or old age, hastened his death. It
is alleged that in his last moments he called
for water to cool his parched lips, but,
chough his cries were heard.by pasaers-by,
none went to his aid.
Not long ago another inmate, once a
property-owner of the town, died similarly
of a terrible disease. One man, a school
teacher and public lecturer, after enduring
assults and hunger, finally ran away.
The general care of the paupers was
found to be on a par with that given in
the above described cases.* The Selectmen
are charged with trying to kill ofTthe paupers
to get rid of them.
lll| Legal Tight.
Toi'ika, Kan., Dec. 14.?The four suits
of 0. Wood Davis against the St Louis &
San Francisco Railway Company for the
discrimination in cars and other transportation
facilities came up to-day. The suits
involve $107,000. Of this sum $7,000 are
claimed as overcharges. There are two
damage suits growing out of discrimination
in cars and other facilities in trans
portation, in which the claims arefor$72,imn

This ii the first suit of the kind ever
brought in the United State*, ana it will
be a bitterly fought one, Davis having
been forced to go out of business because
of the alleged discrimination, while the
"Friaco" people will for the first time be
forced into court to protect their private
and corporate interests.
British Grain Harkct.
London, Dec. 14.?-The Mark Lane Expreu
in its review of trade daring the past
week says: Values of wheat have not Improved.
Sales of English wheat during
the week were 36,640 quarters at 30s 5d
against 61,240 quarters at 30s 10d during
the corresponding week last year. The
[lour trade was dragging. Inferior barley
was in favor of buyers; prices of superior
ire fully maintained. There is a better
local demand for oats and beans. There
Is merely a retail business in foreign
wheat. Trade in foreign flour is less.
Com -is slow of sale; mixed American
weaker. Large arrivals of Canadian have
woakened values. American oats are
slightly in favor of the aeller. Of the cartoes
of wheat arrived: Seven cargoes
were withdrawn, ten were sold and two
remained, including one California. A
dozen cargoes are due this week. Trade
for mart is steady. There is rather more
inquiry for California and Oregon wheats.
At to-day's market only a retail business
was done in wheat. Frices were in iavor
of buyers. Foreign wheat if nominally
unchanged. Corn was occasionally 3d
cheaper. Other articlea were quiet but
steady.

Puiladblpuia, Dec. 12.?The,wonderful
activity in textile mills of nearly all kinds
is the moat encouraging feature at this
writing. The distribution of dry goods of
all kinds is remarkably large. Retailers
are meeting with an unexpected demand,
and are duplicating purchases of thirty to
sixty days ago, with a vigor that is atimu*
iating activity at manufccturing centres
here and throughout New England. The
demand ia moatly for medium grades
I r.t of all kinds, although
the requirement* for the finer
grades are by no means restricted.
Hosiery manufacturers are crowded with
orders and fire rushing productions on
spring stocks. Considerable machinery
baa been put in and makers of knitting
machinery are now crowded with orders
for work for delivery, during the winter.
Gingham mills are * quite busy. The
woolen mills are stimulated to a heavy
production by the liberal distribution
during the fall. And carpet manufacture
ere have increased their productive cspac*
ity 5 or 10 percent
Till WOOL MARKBT.
The wool market is strengthened by
this activity, and heavy purchases have
been made in primkry markets>t reasonable
price*, because of the disposition of
holders there to meet buyers views, The
boot and shoe trade is particularly active,
and work is being pushed on spring or*
dew, which are begining to arrive. Prices
will not be generally advanced, but advances
made will be nearly sufficient to
cover increasing prices of raw material.
The distribution of leather and leather
goods, during the fall, and up to
present writing has been enormous, and
manufacturers here and in New England
predict a heavy spring trade. Low prices
rule for all kinds of stable fabrics. This
increased consumption stimulates production
and generates confidence, which is
felt in all industrial circles.
Makew of textile machiney, looms, engines,
boilers, shafting and all mill appliance
are receiving urgent orders for delivery
of machinery during February and
March.

Merchant bars, plates and sheets are
rather quiet, though firm in price at $1 75
in bars. Nails are $2 ~>0 to $2 GO. The demand
is extitmelr urgent. The productive
capacity will be increased in this
State.
The leading architects of this city and
New York have been instructed within a
few days to prosecute drawings and preparatory
work for building enterprises,

INDUSTRIAL ACTIVITY DAWNING, I
Greater and more industrial activity is '
dawning upon ua than is generally observed
or admitted. In some sections of
the country depression seems to prevail, }
and the distribution of good* does cot
seem to indicate any decided improve- 1
ment. Bat in the cities and towns and 1
larger villages throughout the country, the
uniform testimony of good authority is,
that the increasing distribution of manufactured
products is assured because of
the increased purchasing capacity of the .
manufacturing and agricultural interests.
Haw material of various kinds has advanced,
such as iron, steol and wool, bat
the advance will not be such as to jeopardise
the permanoncy of the improvement
by stimulating too great production. ^
