Completely its force tells home upon
their eause. His offers of amnesty to
the poor' deluded masses' of the. rebel
States, will meet the approval of every
honest man,, no less than his decided
views relative to the exclusion of the
leaders in this wicked nnd merciless
war, from any benefits thereof. Let us
wait patiently for the results. The

X3" The Democratic party 'seems
divided into two branches, one known
as War Democrats, the other Peace
Democrats. As the latter class arro
gate to themselves the exclusive right
to be considered the; genuine, original
Jacksonian Democracy, it may not be
amiss to investigate their claim to it:
A Peace Democrat is one who believes
in. the doctrine of States. Bights as
taught by John C. Calhoun, for which
leaching, Jackson regretted very much
that he had not hung the said Calhoun.
The' Pface Democrat goes one step
further than Calhoun, and insists that
Southern Slates have rights, Northern
States none. It is all a right of the
South to array her people ' againtt the
Government, but the North must not
call on 'her sens to defend it. He be
lieves ip tbe rights of men especially
to take from other men their rights.
He, believes in "the Constitution as it
is," but to be construed by rebels in
arms against it. Ho Jbelieres a men
to be equal, and talks glibly ofthe
poor man. and "the dear people," yet
he sympathizes with a hell-born aristoc
racy who have deluged the .country in
blood, because they were too well
born and: bred to submit to the election
of one of the "dear people" who hap
pened at one time to split rails for, an
honest living. He believes the Demo
cratic party a divine institution, special
ly designed to govern the country,
whe'thera majority of the "dear peo
ple" consent to it or not. He at once
decides which is the genuine "Old Dr.
Jacob Townseed" or Democratic party
from the name it assumes, for tbe same
reason that if a horse be called
swift, you can safely bet on his
speed. He boasts ereatly of. the
blessed privilege of voting at elections
He only considers himself bound by the
'result, when it places the Democracy in
power., in mis respect, ne imunies
the Scotchman who played cards with
some Jews nnd lost his "pilp," where
upon he 'grabbed" the funds, and
shaljing his. fist at the terrifie'd Israel
ites, exclaimed, "Dora ce, ye are all
the . enemies. of-our Lord. He thinks
the United States ought to have Cuba
by fraud or force. He also thinks the
United States have no right'to prevent
Kentucky from being stolen away from
us, He thinks all this time that con
sistency is a jewel found only among
the Peace Democracy. So do we. '

with 118 others. The rqem, although
large for ibe purpose Tbriginally de
signed, was.iop snail lor 12U men as
a prison. But one stove was allowed
in it, and as few, if any, of the prisoners
had blankets, or even coats, they suf
fered intensely from cold. Their food
consisted of corn bread coarse and. raw,
and not half enough of even that; with
a iincup.ful of cabbage soup very thin
and -watery. As they never got sight,
taste or smell, of the, meat used in
making it, it may bare been mule or
dog for aught they knew;
Tubs were placed in the same room
for private 'purposes, the stench from
which, .rendered the atmosphere over
powering; yet these men slept, ate, and
lived for three weeks in. this horrible
place. Lice in countless thousands,
swarmed over everything, rendering
rest impossible.
After getting clear of Richmond,
they were indebted wholly to the slaves
for sustenance and guidance into our
lines. These men left Gallia county
imbued with strong prejudices against
thq negro. Their' experience in getting
out of Dixie, ss worked a marvellous
change in their views, nnd they1 'are
now decidedly of opinion that one Joyal
negro is worth three rebels at any time,
Strange, indeed, that those only who
have ho knowledge of Southern affairs.
should think otherwise.
STk meeting of gentlemen, styling
themselves the "Conservative Union
National Committee," was held a few
days ago at the Burnet House in Oin
cinnati. Quite a number of. sage re
1 - 1 4 .1. - .1
ramus nuoui me weainer were made,
and a resolution adopted in favor of
ueo. a. aicuieiian lor tne f residency
The resolution was ordered to1 be
printed, after which the Conservative
Union National Committee adjourned
"to take suthin." Our readers will
remember that George B. McClellan
was once Commander of the army, of
the Potomac, quite lately interested in
the election of Judge Woodward, the
copperhead candidate for Governor of
Pennsylvania, nnd now, we think, re
sides in New Jersey. -
Bk3 Hsrper's Weekly contains n
pictoral representation ol the prisoners
at Belle Isle, near Richmond This
picture many suppose to be grossly ex
aggerated. Rev.,.. W. Hulter,, who
has lately been released from Rich
mond, says of it: "The pictorial repre
sentation in Harper's Weekly, so far
from being an exaggeration, affords but
a very inadequate view' of these scenes
of wretchedness." Persons who have
seen that picture, can imagine nothing
more hideous. -What then must the
reality be if Mr. Hutter speaks truth
fully? ;

Reports reached Gallipolis ' on

PROCEEDINGS OF CONGRESS
' For the veek ending. Monday, Da
whwh 'l4tb, carefully Inslensed:
Congress assembled oMdsy,ftbe
7th inst., at 12 A. M. Schuyler Cel-
fax having been previously nomiaated
in caucus was elected speaker of&e
Mouse on tbe 1st ballot. The vote
stood as follows: Whole number 181;
necessary to a ehoice 92.
1st Balldt-Colfar,-10l; 8. S.'Cox,
42; Dawson, 12;Mal!ory, 10r Stibbins
8; Bng '4; Blatr 2; Stiles 1. The De
mocracy scatteredconsiderably as .will
be seen by the above vote. Elheridge's
courage failed him at the last in car
rying out the foul plot concocted -by the
copperheads -to exclude certain States
for want of cerjjin certificates in due
lorm. This ratner disconcerted the
gang, and, hence the division ofr their
forces. On Tuesday, McPheraon of
Pa., was elected Clerk, Ordway of N
H., Scrgt. at Arms, Qoodenougb Door
keeper and King, Postmaster.
On Wednesday the President's Mes
sage, was received and read. -A reso
lution waa offered by Washburn of
III., tendering the thanks of Congress.
to General Grant and hi a brave army
for their gallant conduct during the
war, and for providing a suitable med
al for General Grant, in .the name of
the United States, which passed with
out debate or opposition.
The committees were probably an
nounced on Monday. It is understood
the Military Committee will consist of
Major General Schenck, Major Gen
eral Garfield, Brig. General Loan, and,
Brig. General Faunsworth of Ways
and Means, Thad. Stevens will con
tinue Chairman. In the Senate Colla
mer has been ' rerao ved from the Fi
nance Committeo.
?rJ. L. Armstrong, a citizen of
Gallia county, was tried in the United
States Court, at Cincinnati, a few days
since, on a charge of harboring a -de
serter, who was his own, son. Th
jury returned a verdict of guilty.-
Armstrong was sentenced to pay a fine
of 8100, and undergo an imprisonment
in the Penitentiary for the period of
six months. Harboring deserters has
become rather n dangerous operation
The present largo reward offered for
deserters, Is having tho effect to smoke
out many, who for months past have
evaded capture. Mr. Armstrong's
case may serve to show that the Federal
Government is become terribly in ear
nest on all points tending to 'crush out
this rebellion.
3TThe first practical printer elected
Speaker of the House of Representa
tives, is Bohuyler Colfax, of Indiana.
The newspaper men in Washinglon
are so elated by it, that they design
giving him a complimentary dinner.
The army news for the past week
is of little interest comnared with that
of thejriveek previous. The .array of
the Potomac.seems to have gone into
winter quarters and we shall have, lit
tle else to report of it until tho spring
campaign opensby which time it is
presumed General starvation will have
completed the final rout of the rebel
hosts.
It is rumored that Vice President
Stephens, has again visited Fortress
Monroe, on an embassy of peace.
Gen. Butler will be found ready to at
tend to him. if true, but tho whole
thing is a fable.
General Butler has taken active
measures to enlist negro soldiers in his
department. Army operations in Texas
are being pushed forward vigorously.
and .eyery thing augurs well for tbe
success .of Gen. Baqks.
