FLEECE AND FOREST!
Wool Adulteration and Woods Con-
sidered by Cattlemen.
PROF. SHAW, MINNESOTA, SPEAKS
Interstate Commerce Commission
Irgci That Railway Competi
tion. Be JEQncoura«ed.
Chicago, Dec. 4.—The second sesison of I
the convention of the National Stock
association began at 9:30 a. m. and the at- |
tendance showed that a large majority of
the delegates were enjoying the entertain
ment offered by the stock show and at
other places.
F. J. Hagenbarth of -Idaho read a paper
on "The Adulteration of Wool." He pre
sented facts to show that wool is adul
terated and eaid that such adulteration
deprives the wool grower of a much en
larged , market, and therefore was a ma
terial injury to his interests, and called
for prompt regulation. It was also to the I
Interests of the wool manufacturer that j
adulteration should be curtailed. The
public, he said, did not demand the adul
terated stuff, but it was the clothier and j
the cheap retailer and the bogus manufac- '
turer who beguiled the public into the be- j
lief that it was buying all wool when in j
reality It was buying shoddy and cotton \
and paying all wool prices therefor. He !
urged the passage of a bill by congress j
providing for the Inspection of woolen
goods and shoddy and the proper stamping
of the same, a fine of from $50 to $500 to
be Imposed for each violation of the law
by a manufacturer and from $100 to $1,000
for a dealer who buys unstamped adul
terated cloth or sells it In the piece or as
clothing. ,
Forest Reserves.
Glfford Pinchot, government forester,
■poke of "The Grazing Problem in the ;
Forest Reserves." Ho said there were j
certain places where the interests harm- i
fully affected by grazing was out of the j
question—among others the Bull Run
forest reserve in Oregon and the re
serves of southern California, but there j
wer vast regions in which nothing but i
reasonable regulations was required to j
make the grazing industry safe, and to I
demonstrate that it might always, as it
always should, be a help and not a
hindrance to every other interest in the
oommunity.
Honorable J. Sterling Morton, former
secretary of agriculture, read a paper en
titled "The Inconsistency of the Grout i
Bill," which provides for a tax upon but
terlne and oleomargarine.
Professor Thomas Shaw of the Univer
sity of Minnesota discussed the "Dual j
Cow," or the cow bred and fed for her
milk and meat. Professor Eugene Daven- I
port, of the Illinois experiment station de- j
clared that stock -was judged from too
many viewpoints.
"Stock Is judged," said he, "from the
standpoint of the (butcher, the feeder, the
breeder and the fancier. A more general
system of judging should 'be used."
"What the Live Stock Interests of the
United States can Really Expect of Con- j
gress," was the subject of an address of
William M. Springer, of Washington, D.
C. He told of the troubles of the con
gressman.
Speaks on. Railways.
Dr. D. E. Salmon, chief of the bureau
of animal industry, spoke on "Federal In
spection for Interstate Shipments of Live
Stock."
C. A. Prouty, a member of the Interstate
commerce commission, spoke on "Needed
Changes in the Interstate Commerce
Laws." He said the commission had been
referred to as the "judicial It." The pres
ent law on which the commission is found
ed aud by which it acts should ibe wiped
off the slate and new ones enacted. The
speaker declared impressively:
The time is fast coming when there will
be no competition between railroads. The
cost of bringing a steak from Texas to Ver
mont is now only about 1 cent a pound. This
is cue to competition among the railroads.
This competition you cattlemen should try to
promote. What is the purpose of these
railroac" combinations? To make money. It
is not the reduction In operating expenses
whereby the roads expect to increase their
dividends. It Is by forcing more freight
money from the public.
The following organizations have been
accepted as members of the association:
Northern Montana Wool Growers' associa
tion, 10,000 sheep; Central Montana Wool
Growers' association, 1,500,000 sheep; Ameri
can Angora Producers' association, 17,000
goats; Tennessee State Cattle Sanitary board;
Minnesota Stock Brokers' association, 10,400,
--000; Kansas Stock Growers' association, 1,500,
--000 cattle.
Extolling; President Rooievelt.
Th» convention adopted resolutions
voicing satisfaction in the fact that a man
who understands the cattle interests sits
In the president* chair at Washington.
After lamenting the death of President
McKinley the resolutions read:
Resolved, That we send greeting to President
Roosevelt, assuring him of the loyalty and
support of the stockmen of the country in all
his undertakings for the good of the peo
ple. We recognize in our new chief executive
one who Is familiar with the industry wa
represent, who has wielded a lariat and
branding Iron and knows personally of the
Joys, the hardships and the fatigues of life
on the ranch and range. The cowboy on the
range and the stockman on the ranch all feel
that in President Roosevelt the nation has
a loyal, honest and fearless ruler and the
live stock industry has a friend at court In
the person of one who knows the needs and
necessities of that industry.
Following is the substance of the other
resolutions:
That Arizona and New Mexico be admitted
to statehood.
That the duties on hides he retained so long
as the mail who manufacturers them Into
different articles is protected by the tariff.
That by treaty between this government and
Germany the latter government remove the
ban on American meats and that if the Ger
man government will appoint its own in
spectors to send to this country, the Na
tional Live &tock association will Bee to the
paying of their salaries, providing that meats
bearing the stamp of the inspectors be re
ceived into Germany without protest.
That an interstate law for the prosecution
of horse thieves and "cattle rustlers" be en
acted.
That the President appoint a commissiou
to visit England and work against the dis
crimination which Canadian cattlemen seek
for themselves.
That buzzards be exterminated.
That the efforts of the bureau of animal
Industry in seeking knowledge of bovine
tuberculosis and to prevent the disease are
approved.

Finns Show Their Hatred
Special to The Journal.
Crystal Falls, Mich., Dec. 4.—To show its abhorrence of the czar's policy in
Finland, and particularly of the man—Governor General Nikolai Bobrikoff—Nicholas
has put there to carry out the Russian mandates, the lodge of the Finnish National
society in this city has hit upon a novel scheme. The society has ordered many fancy
cuspidors from a Milwaukee manufacturer. In the bottom of each will be a picture
of Bobrikoff, who ihas been unusually severe in his efforts to deprive the Finns of
what little liberty they have remaining. In addition, the name of the governor gen
eral will be printed in gold letters around the picture, so there will be no mistake
as to who is to be expectorated upon.
May Revolutionize the Game of War
Atony York Sun Special Sorvlom ,
Philadelphia, Dec. 4.—Announcement has been made of the finding by the war
department of an explosive powerful enough to shatter the most modernized armor
plate and yet insensitive:enough to be practicable for use as a bursting charge for
projectiles. Three years ago the ordnance department placed the matter of finding
a powerful explosive in the hands of Captain Beverly W. Dunn, the government ex
pert on fuses and high explosives at the Frankfort arsenal in this city, with,the re
sult that a new explosive and a new fuse have been combined in a shell that threat
ens to revolutionize the game of war. No armcr v r t '
Is capable .of withstanding its attack. The wonderful power of the new explosive
was determined by _avrecent test at | the Sandy Hook ; proving ground in competiton
with the Gathmann system for firing high'explosives.
OPPOSING ANARCHY
■London Papers Applaud Roosevelt's
Declarations.
GERMANY AND "AMERICAN PERIL"
— — "
Vienna. Paper ' Says Strength of the
>le«sa&re Lies in Its Mod
erate Tone. '
London, Dec. 1.--No portion of .the
president's message is more cordl.'ly ap
proved of in England than; that referring
to the question of the treatment of an
archists. It is considered, exceedingly
gratifying that President Roosevelt should
not be afraid to make proposals which,
on the surface, are open to the criticism
that they are subversive of personal lib
erty in the matter of opinion. In this
country there is a strong undercurrent
of feeling against laws which permit aud
actually encourage the immigration of
foieign anarchists.. In reference to the
proposal' that mankind should bind itself
together to make anarchy, like piracy, a.
crime against the law of nation, it is
pointed out that the difficulty is to do
fine what anarchy consists of and to ob
tain trustworthy evidence against those
hiding such a doctrine before th v cm
ink crt acts wh.'ch would reidei !h;m
ait*ctable to crdr&ry criminal law.
General London Approval.
President Roosevelt's message holds the
first place in the afternoon newspapers
here to-day. Strong general approval of
the pronouncement, which, as the St.
James Gazette says: "Strikes note:* of
conscious strength and assured ntcceas,"
is the pervading tone of the editorials.
"The spirited declaration for Monroeism
will cause a flutter in Europe," says the
Westminster Gai.otte, which continues:
If the kaiser is really of the opinion, as
alleged, that "the American peril" is the
question of the future of Europe, be will
find confirmation in the message. He will
envy Secretary Gage's surplus of £15,000,000
available for building ironclads or other pur
poses, for the American doctriofi, backed by
the American surplus, means that many
European ambitions in South America ara
foredoomed to failure. We do not doubt that
it is the policy of this country, if called
upon to make a choice, to stand by the United
States in defense of the doctrine. We also
are an American power and it was we who
first suggested the idea.
After noting that South America, the
only outlet for the surplus population of
Europe, is largely in the possession of the
corrupt Spanish, over wnom tho United
States throws its aegis without guaran
teeing good government, the Westminster
Gazette concluded
It is not easy to affirm this in the interests
of mankind and when the United States,
after warning Europe not to enter America,
proceeds itself to step out from the American
continent, even a theoretical defense is diffi
cult. The situation has the germs of an im
mense controversy in the future.
Austrian Paper* Commend Somewhat
The Vienna j.^pers are unanimous in
praising the reference to anarchists, but
on ctnor points they are not ijuite bo
laudatory.
The Fremenblatt comments on .the
peaceful tone of the message, remarking
that President Rco&e^lt evidently will
not allow himself to be carried away by
seuseless chauvinists.
The Ts'eUs-Woincr Tageblatt dwells on
its "imperialistic character," adding:
There lives in America a spirit as an "ap
pendant" to the Monroe doctrine formula of
Europe for the Americans and this formula,
although clad in the most peaceful phrases,
pervades the message.
The Deutsch Volksblatt declares that
the policy enunciated must expand Ameri
can production, and, therefore, "measures
for the protection of Austrian production
are required by the dictates of self-pr<#,
ervation."
The Austrian Volks-Zeitung believes
that .the strength of the inesT3%e lies In
the moderation of its tone, adding "It
Breaks in the language of a strong man
who knows he requires no sonorous words
to bo beard."
The Neue-Weiner Journal, also dealing
with the power of the message, recom
mends its close study, so as to "find
means at the proper .time of spoiling his
game."

| Mann, ho has long been prominently

this city, was to-day consecrated bishop
j of the missionary district of North Da

elaborate ceremonies. After the rendi
tion of the processional hymn the conse
cration sermon was preached by the Right
I Rev. Theodore Morrison, bishop of lowa.
The ceremony of consecration, which is
i a part or the communion office of the
; church, consisted of the introduction of
j the bishop-elect by two bishops appointed
| for the purpose, the Right Rev. Samuel
■ C. Edsall, bishop of Minnesota, and the
I Right Rev. Frank Millspaugh, bishop of
I Kansas. Then followed the reading of
i the certificates, including the testimonial
of the ..house of bishops and the house of
deputies and the- commission of the pre
siding bishop at the consecration. These
I set out the election of Dr. Mann by the
San Francisco convention and the au
thority of the presiding bishop for the
service of consecration.  - -
Dr. Mann was next examined by. the
presiding bishop, the. Right Rev. Daniel

with the order of examinations set out
in the Episcopal prayer book. The ques
tions answered. Dr. Mann donned the
vestments of his office, assisted by the
attending presbyteries, the Very Rev.
Hugh L. Burleson and the Rev. Robert

Its Report Favoring the Nicaragua
Sent to Congress.
COMPARISON OF THE TWO ROUTES
Point* of Advantage of the One Fa
vored Over the I'uuamu
Cumvauy'i Ditch.'
Washington, Dec. 4.—The report of the
isthmian canal commission was sent to
congress to-day. The commission favors
thu Nicaragua route and makes an esti
mate of $189,864,002 as the total cost of
construction of the canal through Nicar
agua. The estimated cost of the Panama
route is $144,233,358, but, the report says,
it would cost $109,141,000 to obtain the
Panama concession. The commission
values the work done at $40,000,000. The
report says:
The Panama route is feasible as a sea. level
canal, while the Nicaragua route must be by
locks, but Lake Nicaragua will furnish an
inexhaustible supply of water for the canal.
The Nicaragua" route has no natural harbors
at either end, but satisfactory harbors may be
constructed. Harbors already" exist at each
.end of the Panama route, but considerable
work must be done.' at the entrance of the
harbor on the At^tlc/side. ; "With adequate'
force "and plant; ' the commission 'estimates
that the Nicaragua canal can be completed
in six years,-exclusive'of two years for pre
paration.. Ten years In .estimated to com
plete tie Panama canal. Th.a v total length of
the ; Nicaragua rout* is 183.6ti miles and the ;
Panama route 49.09 miles "■ The estimated
cost of operating and maintaining the Nic- I
aragua... canal, .annually is ;$1,350,000 .greater
than that of the Panama canal. The esti
mated time for a deep-draught vessel to pass
through, th Panama canal is twelve hours,
and through Nicaragua canal ; thirty-tßree
hours. ; : ;;' • /■ \
The Nicaragua route is more advantageous
for commerce save that originating on the
west coast of South America. For the gulf
ports the advantage is two days, and for most
ports on ■ the Atlantic and Pacific one day.
The Nicaragua route is said to be better for
sailing vessels on account of favoring winds.
Hygienic conditions also favor Nicaragua.
The United States should acquire control of
a strip of territory miles wide from sea to
sea through which to build the canal. The
consent of Nicaragua and Costa Rica must
be obtained to construct the < canal, but this
can be easily secured. The -concessions
granted by the Colombian government to thj
Panama Canal company have many years to
run and new concessions cannot be granted
the United States.
After considering all the facts developed by
the investigations made by the commission,
the actual situation as it now stands, and
having in view the terms offered by- the new
Panama Canal company, this commission is
of opinion that the most practicable and feas
able route for an isthmian canal, to be under
the control, management and ownership of
the United States, is that know as the
Nicaragua route.

'PINO Public men don't agree
as to what is the best
TARIFF. thing to be done regard
ing a Philippine tariff, in
the light of the recent supreme court de
cision. All kinds of remedies are sug
gested and sentiment is crystallizing very
slowly. The proposition most talked of
is that Speaker Henderson appoint the j
ways and means committee at once and for '
that committee to report a joint resolu- ;
tion imposing Dingley rates on all Philip- !
pine imports and for it to report at the
same time a bill embracing the new
Philippine tariff recently promulgated by
the war department. The passage of the
Joint resolution and bill would settle the
question.
But the democrats are preparing to
block this program, and thet is why there
is so much hesitation over its adoption.
Senator Jones of Arkansas and other
democrats do not hesitate to say that
they will not permit any tariff legislation
for the Philippine islands or of any other
kind in the nature of Imposing new duties
to go through the senate without the full
est debate and strongest opposition the
democrats can offer. That would mean a
long delay in the senate, probably, and in
the meantime Philippine imports would
come into the United States free of duty.
Duties would be collected in the islands,
however, as the Bupreme court has not
yet decided that point. Hemp is on the i
free list. The only free things that '<
would come to any extent would be
sugar and tobacco. Commenting on the
situation, to-day's Washington Post says:
The Philippine situation oners in a way an
opening for the opening of the tariff ques
tion and there is great pressure, from ths
northwest especially, for some action that
will at least have political effect on next sum
mer's campaign. Mr. Tawney of Minnesota,
who has been hesitating in his affiliation with
the two republican divisions of the ways and
meal's committee, is said to be favoring such
a course.
OHIPPBWA Representative Eddy
called on the president
LEGISLATION, to-day to pay his respects
and congratulate him on J
his message to congress. Mr. Eddy says
that he does not want to oppose Judge
Morris 1 Chippewa timber legislation, in
asmuch as the reservations are not now
in his district. He will relntroduce his
bill to amend the Nelson act. He is de
cidedly opposed to allowing the secre
tary of the interior discretion in the
matter of contractors establishing mills
on reservations. He believes that should
be optional with the purchasers of logs
