It has beena subject of comment
that the usual features of the Sunday
newspapers showed too little variety.

field.
Conan Doyle received $25,000 for the
American serial rights of his

Loneon, Swell Ford and many other
popular novelists contribute to the
publication which set the pace by pay

men and women write constantly for
it on all subjects of timely interest.
