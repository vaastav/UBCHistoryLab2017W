SATURDAY, DECEMBER 9, 1882.
The President’s Message.
The message transmitted to.Cungrcsß on
Monday last by President ' Arthur, opens
with a reference to our foreign
and our intercpHSe is set forth with each
particular nation in detail. The President
then deals with domestic affairs, giving a
of the reports of heads of depart
ments, and approving or disapproving of
recommendations as seems to him beet.
In view of the vast and annually increas
ing surplus in the treasury, which invites
extravagant legislation, the President ad
vocates the abolition of all internal revenue
taxes, except upon distilled spirits, ferment
ed liquors, tobacco and the special tax upon
dealers in liquors, and a reduction of the
tariff, but not such a reduction that ample
protection would not be afforded to the in
dustries of the country. He also advo
cates a revision of the tariff, and the en
largement of the free list.
Ground is taken against "river and har
bor bills,” such as was passed at the last
session, and which had much effect in
changing the political complexion of the
next House of Representatives. The Pres
ident thinks that appropriations for the im
provement of the waterways of the coun
try should be made by separate bills for
each object, and if that cannot be done, the
President should bo given the power to
veto parts of bills, a power given to Gov
ernors of a number of states by their con
stitutions, in order that meritorious appro
priations may not be defeated by improper
ones, and also to relieve the Executive of
embarrassments that sometimes arise when
he feels it incumbent to exercise the veto
power.
As the revenue from the postal service
exceeds expenses by about three and a half
millions of dollars annually, it is recom
mended that letter postage be reduced to
two cents, but the President dissents from
the recommendation that the postal de
partment be given control of the telegraph
system of the country.
Reference is made to the star-route trials,
and the President says they have been con
ducted with ‘‘great zeal and ability,’ and
though they resulted in a disagreement of
the jury diligent efforts will be made to
punish the guilty in the trials now pro
gressing. The former trial was badly man
aged, and had the recent elections resulted
differently, the present trial would have
been a greater farce. The department of
justice seems to have been as corrupt as
the star-route thieves, but now that the
President has cleansed the service somewhat
a different result will probably be reached.
Allusion is made to the illiteracy of the
people, as shown by the recent census, and
Congress is asked to consider whether the
government should not supplement state
and individual efforts in behalf of educa
tion. As the public debt, as the President
says, is being paid off too rapidily, and the
large surplus in the treasury is conducive
of extravagance, the President might have
advocated a distribution of the excess in
the treasury among the states of the Union
.ding to illiterate population. Huch a
disposition would seem to be wise and one
that would give general satisfaction.
No recommendation is made in regard
to suppressing poligamy, the President be
lieving that existing statutes are sufficient
and that recent enactments should be un
disturbed until time develops their effect.
This message is perhaps the first in a quarter
of a century that has not made some special
recommendations on the subject.
A year ago the President discussed civil
sendee reform, but made no recommenda
tions, yet assured Congress that any laws
bearing thereon would have his sanction.
In his recent message, however, he alludes
to the expression of public sentiment on
the question, and says action should no
longer be postponed. The President ar
gues well on the subject, and gives evidence
that the result of the late elections has had
a wholesome effect upon him. If Congress
is affected in the same way, much good may
result from the present session.
The President disapproves of political
assessments upon office-holders, which is
another good result of the verdict of the
people at the last elections. He says that
in July last he “authorized a public an
nouncement that employes of the govern
ment should regard themselves as at liberty
to exercise their pleasure in making or re
fusing to make political contributions, and
that their action in that regard would in
no manner effect their official status.” That
announcement is well remembered, and it
is also well remembered that Don Cameron
and Billy Mahone were allowed to assess
employes any amount they thought proper
and to have discharged any and all who re
fused to pay. Cameron only had a few re
movals made, but Mahone So changed
postmasters*and postal agents that the mail
service in Virginia was absolutely abomina
ble, and he had widows turned out of office
to make room for those who would contrib
ute to his corruption fund and who could
control votes. All this, was known to the
President, and was done with his acquies
ence if not approval. In fact the proceed
ing was a part of the bargain with Mahone
by Arthur and the Republican leaders.
Only the chief subjects of the message
have been referred to above. Elsewhere
will be found an article on the report of
the Secretary of the Treasury, a synopsis
of which is embodied in the message. In
this issue, also, will be found an extract or
two from the message itself.
There is nothing new in the message.
The main and most interesting features of
it relate to civil-service reform, reduction
of federal taxation and political assessments.
On all of these the people have preceded
the President, and his recommendations
thereon only follow public sentiment.
All charges against Arabi Pasha, the
leader of the Egyptian revolt, having been
withdrawn except that of rebellion and re
fusing to desist when ordered to do so by
the Khedive, he plead guilty last Sunday
\ and was sentenced f 8 dfeath under the law.
The Khedive, however, immediately com
muted the sentence to exilefor life- It is
thought that Arabi will go to England.
Hon. Marshall Jewell, chairman of the
Republican national committee, has called
a meeting of the committee for January
4,7, at the Arlington Hotel, Washington.
I : I
Take Any Shape But That.
Occasionally somebody mentions Gov.
Hamilton for renomination, and also Ex-
Gov. Whyte. The political seer of the
Baltimore American has frequently named
both of these gentlemen recently. These
names may serve as well as any others as
the basis of a newspaper paragraph, but to
talk of renominating either of them is idle
and absurd. If by any sort of political
legerdemain it were possible for either of
them to get upon the ticket for Governor
again, there would be an open revolt through
out the State. The political status of
■ both of these gentlemen was plainly shown
at the last election. Gov. Hamilton took
the stump for Hon. Montgomery Blair,
and in his own county of Washington,
which Mr. Syester and Judge Alvey both
carried, Mr. Blair was beaten by 720 ma-
I 7 *
jority ! To say that this result was not in
part attributable to Gov. Hamilton, is to
take an erroneous view of the subject, in
, our judgment. Gov. Hamilton took in
terest enough in Mr. Blair to mount the
rostrum and persuade his fellow citizens to
support him, but instead of benefiting Mr.
Blair his advocacy of him seems to have
resulted in positive injury. Ex-Governor
Whyte's weakness was demonstrated in a
similar way in Baltimore. His brother,
Judge Pinkney, was on the regular Judi
cial ticket, which he advocated upon the
hustings with all the zeal and ability he
was master of, and yet that ticket was de
feated by an overwhelming majority. These
facts and circumstances ought to be suffi
cient to give a quietus to the aspirations of
both of and to silence their
respective friends. It would be an act of j
political fe/o de sc to renominate either of :
them, and the late election clearly demon
■ strates it. If the Democrats would succeed
| in the next Gubernatorial contest they |
must take a candidate who has no burdens
to carry.
To endeavor to divert attention from j
1 their own frauds and pollution of the ballot)
I the Mahoneites in Virginia have instituted I
an inquiry into the election modes of the
| Democrats in the United States Court, j
John S. Wise, who has been awarded a j
, certificate as congressmen-at-larsre, is United i
j States district attorney, and is conducting j
! the investigation. So far they have not I
! unearthed anything to the disadvantage of
| the Democrats. On Wednesday, Congress- |
j man Dezendorff, a Republican, was in court
j in answer to a summons, and being asked |
i about frauds at the last election, said he j
! had no personal knowledge on the subject, j
| When asked to communicate the names of
i those whom he thought were cognizant of
.{ o o
j frauds, he gave the names of Gen. Mahone, ;
l 11. S. Collector James D. Brady, State
1 Auditor Allen, and all of the Readjuster
county treasurers and collectors. This turn
| was unexpected, and will very likely break
1 | up the investigation.
A Rare Case.
Rev. Campbell Fair, Rector of Ascension
Church, Lafayette Square, Baltimore, has
declined the very flattering call he recently
received to a church in Philadelphia. This
is an exceptional case, and worthy of more
than a passing notice. The usual course
j pursued by the clergy, on receiving a call
y to a more pretentious church with a big
, salary, is to make it a matter of “profound
meditation and prayer,” and then side with
I the church offering the big salary. Napo
leon used to say that Providence was al
ways on the side of the heaviest battalions.
As in war, so in church affairs, if we may j
judge from the course of the clergy. Prov- j
, idence is always ou the side of the heaviest
[ | salaries. Mr. Fair’s case Ls an exception.
Congress convened on Monday for the
last session, and went to work immediately.
Bills have been introduced to inquire into
political assessments, to reduce taxation,
and upon various other measures, more or
j less of importance. The bill to admit
i Dakota will be called up next week. Two ;
| bills regarding public education by the
government have been made a special order
for January 9th. On the abolition of tax
on cigars, snuff’, tobacco and cigarettes, two
! reports have been made, a majority of the
! ways and means committee favoring it.
Resolutions have been introduced calling
' for information concerning the pension
list, and to prohibit the use of the capitol
building for other than legitimate purposes.
John Roach’s idea of building up our
commercial marine by subsidies, and sugar
| coating his plan by the suggestion of tnrn
| ing our merchantmen into cruisers iu case
| of war, is a very good plan for larding Mr.
Roach, but his merchantmen would be
worthless as men-of-war. If it be desira
ble to have an efficient navy let ships be
built for the purpose, ships of steel armor
that could stand any amount of the hardest !
rapping from guns of the heaviest calibre, j
We had bettor do this, now, in a time of
I peace, and while the treasury is full, than 1
. to wait till we are forced to do it, hurried
[ _ _ ....
ly and imperfectly, by impending hostilities
with some foreign power.
j The election frauds at the Council elec
tion in Baltimore in October have turned
out to be allegations only, without any cor
roborating facts. Detective Freeburger,
who was charged with being implicated,
was discharged by the grand jury, and on
Monday was acquitted by the Board of
' Police Commissioners. The whole case
p against all those implicated rested on the j
oath of negroes. At the first hearing sev- I
3 eral negroes said they were so drunk they
did not know whether they voted or not,
and afterward one or two said they had
testified falsely, having been paid to do so.

The Paris Moniteur pokes fun at our navy,
1 and says that the French fleet would get away
with it and batter down all our cities in a few
, days. But the trouble is, the French fleet and
* army to boot remember their Mexican ex
i periences too vividly to wish to cross the
Atlantic again. —Baltimore American.
Not only so, but until France recovers
; her lost prestige in her little six months’
i unpleasantness with Germany, it would be
- folly for her to undertake to measure
r strength with Brother Jonathan.
If local optionists cannot claim Queen
. Victoria as one of their number, they can
, claim her as among the sympathizers with
the cmum o£ temperance. In proroguing
Parliament until February 15, she alludes
j in her speech to the decline of the revenue,
I but views it with satisfaction because the
t decline has been on duties ou intoxicating
liquors.
The Treasury Report.
Secretary Folger, in his annual report,
communicates information and opinions on
various topics. He estimates the total reve
nue for the current fiscal year and the year
following at $415,000,000 each, the expendi
tures at $295,000,000 each, and the surplus at
$120,000,000 each.
He recommends that the provision requir
ing the coinage of a fixed amount of silver
dollars each mouth be repealed, that the law
authorizing the issue of silver certificates also
be repealed, and that the certificates in circu
lation be withdrawn as speedily as possible.
Otherwise the accumulation of silver will soon
exceed the capacity of the department to store
it. Of the $128,329,880 thus far coined under
the act of Feb. 28, 1878, only about $34,000,-
000 were in actual circulation at the begin
ning of last month.
Referring to the statistics given by the
Comptroller of the Currency, the Secretary
concurs in his recommendation of a repeal of
the tax upon national bank capital and de
posits. The capital invested in national banks
is $402,341,601. The taxes assessed upon
them by the United States and the States for
the year 1881 were $17,189,080, being at the
rate of 3.7 per cent. The amount assessed
by the United States is near one-half of the
whole. A repeal of the laws providing for it
would still leave those banks liable to an as
sessment by the States of over eight millions
of dollars per annum.
The interest-bearing funded debt of the
United States was on Nov. 1, $1,418,080,200.
The total amount of bonds held by the na
tional banks, State banks, and savings banks
at the nearest corresponding date that could
beascertaned was $659,988,820, which amount
is not greatly less than one-half of the whole
interest-bearing debt.
In view of the large annual surplus revenue
and the rapid extinguishment of the public
debt, the Secretary favors legislation author
izing the department to apply its surplus to
buying in the long bonds even at a high pre
mium rather than to paying off the short bonds.
He suggests also that the fifty million dollars
I held as a fund for the redeption of national
bank notes be treated as public moneys, and
deposited in the banks which are public de
positories. Only in these ways, he thinks,
can an enormous accumulation of money in
the Treasury and a great resulting embarrass
| ment of trade be prevented.
From the various objects of taxation under
! the internal revenue laws the receipts for the
| fiscal year ended June 30, 1882, were as fol
lows: Spirits, $69,873,408: tobacco, $47,391,-
988; fermented liquors, $16,153,920; banks
: and bankers, $5,253,458; adhesive stamps (in
cluding bank checks, $2,318,455.14; friction
i matches, $2,272,268; patent medicines, &c.,
$1,978,395.56), $7,569,108; penalties, &c.,
$199,830; collections not otherwise provided
I for, $81,559; total, $146,523,273. The in
crease of the revenue from spirits during the
j last fiscal year wa552,719,433.30; from tobac
i co in its various forms of manufacture, $4,-
I 536,997; from fermented liquors, $2,453,679;
i from taxes ou banks and bankers, $1,491,250;
total increase of internal revenue from all
j sources, $11,203,361.42.
The whole amount of internal revenue for
j the year ended June 30, 1882, besides that |
from spirits, fermented liquors, and tobacco,
j is $18,073,956; the tax ou circulation and de- j
1 posits of national hanks for the same period :
! is $8,956,794; making $22,030,750; and if this !
! were deducted from our surplus revenue it 1
would still amount to $98,000,000. All inter- j
nal taxes, therefore, the Secretary says, might |
| be abolished, save only those ou spirits, to- j
i baeco, and fermented liquors,
i The Secretary earnestly recommends a
careful revision of the tariff, with a view to I
j substantial reductions, particularly upon su- i
| gar, wool, iron, steel, silk goods, coarse cot
j tons, and raw materials generally. The duty
j on sugar, he says, should be adjusted accord
! ing to some other standard than that of color,
: which no longer indicates value correctly. j
The recommendation of last year is re- (
peated, that the Secretary be authorized to 1
i refer to the Court of Claius, in his discretion, j
any disputed claims against the Government j
involving important questions of law or fact, j
Amendments of the Immigration law are j
suggested, to render its working more efti- i
dent and to remove ambiguities.
The report concludes with the usual de
tails in regard to lighthouses, the coast sur
vey, and similar routine matter.

Our Available Naval Force.
From the President's Message ;
It appears by the Secretary’s report that
the available naval force of the United States
consists of 37 cruisers, 14 single-turreted mon
itors built during the rebellion, a large num
ber of smooth-bore guns and Parrott rifles,
and 87 rifled cannon.
The cruising vessels should be gradually re
placed by iron or steel ships, the monitors by
modern armored vessels, and the armament
I by bigh-power rifled guns.
The reconstruction of our navy, which was
recommended in my last message, was begun
by Congress authorizing iu its recent act the
construction of two large uuarmored steel
vessels of the character recommended by the
Naval Advisory Board, and subject to the
final approval of a new Advisory Board, to be
organized as provided by that act.
I call your attention to the recommendation
of the Secretary and the Board that authority :
be given to construct two more cruisers of
smaller dimensions and one fleet despatch
vessel, and that appropriations be made for
high-power rifled cannon, for the torpedo ser
vice, and for other harbor defences.
Some fourteen governments fitted out ex
peditions to witness the transit of Venus, which
occurred on Wednesday, at a cost of about
$2,000,000. Besides observations were made
by colleges and universities, at a considerable
cost also. The United States Congress ap
propriated $75,000. The object of the obser
vations was to obtain data upon which to figure
out the distance of the Earth from the Snn.
A number of observations have been taken
during several centuries past, and a different
result has been attained each time. The dis- i
tance has generally been believed to be ninety
five millions of miles, though some astronomers
have made it ninety-two millions and others
ninety-six What the last observers will make
it, remains to be seen, but no matter what i
their calculations are, astronomers will be as i
eager to observe the next transit as they were i
to watch this. i

The Moon and Planets in December.
The December moon fulls on the 24th at :
fifty-seven minutes past 10 o’clock in the
! morning. The moon is in conjunction with
: Venus on the 9th, and with Mercury and Mars
' on the 10th, showing how closely the three
j planets cluster together on the western side
and close to the sun. The new moon of the
j 10th is in conjunction with Neptune and Sa-
I turn on the 21st and with Jupiter on the 23rd,
! the day before the full. Planet and moon
j will be at their nearest point about half past
I 9 o’clock in the evening, Jupiter passing two ■
j and a-half degrees north.
Thus December presents an exceptionally ’
beautiful program for planetary students. !
| Venus lead off with a grand transit and in- !
I ferior conjunction. Jupiter comes next in j
I reaching the most important epoch of his 1
1 course, opposition with the sun, when the east
ern sky seems to glow as he comes above the i
horizon. Saturn pursues the even tenor of
; his way high up among the stars. Mars shows i
| a throb of life as he arrives at conjunction with ■

Predicting a Great Storm.
The President has received a coramunica- |
| tion from Prof. E. Stone Wiggings, LL. D., 1
I astronomer of the Canadian Finance Depart- j
rnent, announcing that a great storm will oc- j
i cur in March next; that it will first be felt in |
| the Northern Pacific, will appear in the Gulf j
of Mexico on the night of the 9th, and being
reflected by the Rocky Mountains will cross
the meridian of Washington from the west at
noon of Sunday, March 11, 1883. No vessel,
whatever her dimensions, will be safe out of
harbor, and none of small tonage can hope to
survive the tidal wave and fury of this tempest.
As the wind will blow from the southeast, the j
planetary force will be sufficient to submerge
the low lands of the American coast, especi- 1
ally those bordering on the Gulf of Mexico j
and washed by the Gulf Stream, while the air
currents for several hundred miles along the
east side of the Rocky Mountain range will
spread universal destruction.
The New England states will also suffer
severely from the the wind and floods. No
point outside of harbor in the whole area of
the Atlantic, especially north of the equator,
will be a place of safely; for this will be pre
eminently the greatest storm that has visited
the continent since the days of the illustrious
first President.
A Ruined Life.
“Daniel Christ, for larceny, has been sent
to the penitentiary for two years and six months
by the Baltimore county court.”
The above we clip from one of our Maryland
exchanges. It recalls a host of memories.
Over thirty years ago the writer was a room
mate of this same Daniel Christ. He was then
a bright and rather promising lad though with
a daring disposition which boded trouble for
him when he grew to manhood. He grew to
a powerful and fine looking man, but his youth
ful disposition to go in evil ways had grown
with his growth. And now he is immured in
a prison cell, a great change from the prospects
that his friends imagined for him in his youth,
but the natural result of his reckless conduct
and unlawful acts.— Altoona, Pa., Tribune.
Political Assessments.
The Republican Congressmen who are plan
ning to reconstruct the civil service so that
the next Democratic Congress will have noth
ing to do, will find the resolution offered by
Senator Beck on Tuesday rather embarrassing.
It recites the law against levying political as
sessments, and includes copies of the black
mailing circulars sent out by Hubbell and Ma
hone. It calls for an investigation by the Ju
diciary Committee of the use that was made of
the money, and for the names of Government
employees dismissed since May 5, with a
statement whether such employees had con
tributed as requested. Now let ns see how far
the Republican reformers will go!

Mrs. Cora Richmond, a spiritualist trance
speaker, gave a Chicago audience an account
of the people who lived on the lost continent
now covered by the southern Atlantic. The

ing from dark blue to extreme light blue, and
with forms whose statue resembled those which

muscular strength, and nervous energy, and
six feet and a half in height on the average.
Mrs. Richmond obtained her information from
the spirit of a native.
