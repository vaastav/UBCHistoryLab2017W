BETTED Jilt LIFE,
Reform Urged by the President
In American Families.
PRESENT STATE NOT IDEAL
Husbands, Wives and Children Live
Too Far Apart, He Says—Declares
We Can Pattern From Foreigners.
His Family Club Idea Explained by
Secretary Loeb.
President Roosevelt, In khaki attire,
attended the garden party given on tho
grounds of John Weekes, Jr., at Oyster
Bay, N. Y., the other afternoon for the
benefit of the Nassau hospital and dur
ing his stay remarked to a number of
men, women and children who had
congregated around him that he de
plored the conditions existing in Amer
ican family life.
He had visited and enjoyed many
exhibits on the grounds and was then
escorted to a Swedish and Norwegian
weaving booth, decorated with red,
white and blue. lie regarded the
weaved goods displayed there with in
tent.
"Is. this still done In Sweden?" he
asked.
When told it was he remarked:
"I hope the Swedes who come here
to live will keep their work up. I want
to see all the good customs of the old
countries transplanted and thriving
here. 1 want tho Germans who come
hero to keep up their clubs and soci
eties, where the fathers, mothers and
children visit together. I have worked
to bring about a general observance of
such a system. It has been hard work,
however, but I still have hopes.
"Here i:i America,"he went on.
raising his voice so all who had
grouped about the booth could hear,
"our husbauds ami wives live too far
apart.
"If a man joins a club or organiza
tion his wife will have nothing to do
with it. If a wife belongs to a society
nothing apparently will induce her
husband to have anything to do with
It. We must have a better family life
here in America and learn lessons from
Sweden, Norway and Germany. These
countries give us some of our best cit
izens.
"Look at prosperous Minnesota,
where men of Swedish and Norwegian
parentage are rival candidates for gov- i
crnor. It's good—very good. I hope j
we have more of it."
When President Roosevelt was inter- j
viewed the next day he declined to j
state directly what ideal club and
home conditions he is working for In '
America as announced in his luformal I
talk at Mrs. John Weekes' garden
party.
Late in the evening, however, Secre
tary Loeb stated that he had become
fully conversant with the president's
wishes along the social line and be
lieved that it was one of the most
important pieces of work undertaken
by Mr. Itoosevelt.
By stating that he had been working
for a social condition in which entire
families would belong to the same
clubs the presideot is said to have
meant that he had constantly advo
cated such a condition and had shown
marked consideration to organizations
made up of entire families.
The president believes that the grow- j
lug divorce record and the constantly |
Increasing extravagance in America
are due to a growing indifference to
home life. lie believes that men and
their wives are being educated to have I
absolutely diverse lines of entertain
ment and that the condition can he
remedied by providing a society sys- j
tern that will arrange better for tl -ir j
mutual Interests.
"The-splendid social systems in Ger I
many, for Instance, or In Denmark 01 |
Sweden, or the societies among the
Jewish people," said Mr. I,oeb. "are
what the president hopes to see estab
lished here, lie wishes to see It made I
popular for entire families to take
their eveuing entertainment together,
to see places provided where they can
meet other families amid enjoyable
surroundings.
"Tho president has worked hard
along this line. He never has hesitated
togo out of his way to address socie
ties made up of men and women both
and help them plan to extend their
t work. Often he has given such socie
ties preference over much larger organ
izations composed simply of men.
"Ills present plans for a farmers'
commission has this point chiefly in
* view. By providing agreeable meet
ing places for tho families in farming I
districts, the president believes, the I
boys and girls will grow up to love
country life and not be so constantly
drawn to the cities."
The president, it was explained, be
lieves that the farmers' families of the
country should combine, much as the.v
have combined in Denmark, and pro
vide themselves with many benefits In
a social way never before thought of.
What would be true of the farmin»
districts, the president believes, would
be true in the cities. lie believes that
the majority of men and women would
prefer to have their entertainment in
company if the proper system of so
cieties and clubs lie arranged.
In the president's next message to
congress it Is intimated that he will
have a unique idea to advance along
this line.

A DUSKY CYNIC.
| He Gayly Admitted That the Joke Wai
on Himself.
A lady was walking along Fifth ave
t nue a couple of weeksfago when a blp
negro stepped up to her politely auii
asked her to give him a quarter.
"I am a shipwrecked sailor," he told
her. "Three days ago the ship I was
• i>n went ashore outside Sandy Hook.
Ever since theu I've been wandering
around without being able to get a
' Job."
' The lady gave him a quarter and
■ passed on. A week later while going
' by the same spot on Fifth avenue she
was approached once more by the same
negro.
"I am a shipwrecked sailor," he be
gan. "Three days ago"—
She let him flulsli. Then she re
marked :
"Two weeks ago when I gave you a
quarter you told nie that same story.
Then you said that you had been
wrecked three days before. Now you
say the same tiling."
And she looked at the negro severely.
He threw back his head and burst
forth Into roars of laughter.
"Did—did 1 give you dat story last
week?" he chuckled. "Hid you give
me a quarter? Well, if dat ain't a Joke
on ine"'
And she left him standing on the
sidewalk convulsed with laughter.—

CARDS IN CHURCH.
i They Were Not Uncommon In the Old
Days In England.
I Frequent cases of card playing oc
| curred in churches in eiileu days in the
| high or curtained family pews that
j were to be found in several parts of
England.
j A case of card playing was men
| tioned by the poet Crabbe as having
| occurred In one of those pews in Trow
: bridge parish church. Mr. Reresford
! Ilope stated that card playing was not
j uncommon in churches having cur
j tained pews, where those occupying

I tion of the rest of the congregation.

BUYING CHAIRS BY SIGHT.
Few Folks Ever Think to Try Them
by Sitting In Them.
"I went with some folks the other
day."the man said, "to buy a couple
of chairs. We went to a furniture
store and looked over what they had
to offer.
"There were Just ordinary chairs for
a bedroom, so that It wasn't a very
| momentous purchase. The folks I
was with looked at the cloth on the
chairs and asked questions about the
wood and how the chairs would wear.
Then they bought the chairs and or
dered them sent home.
"What struck me as peculiar about
the transaction was that never once
did either of the two persons with
whom I was think of sitting down In
the chairs to see whether or not they
were comfortable. I dropped into a
furniture store not long afterward
and asked a salesman about It, and I
wasn't surprised to learn that very
few persons buying chairs ever seem
to think about testing them by sitting
In them.
"Except in the case of rockers, that
is. Few persons can resist the temp
tation to take a few preliminary rooks
In a prospective purchase."—New York
Sun.
Learned by Experience.
"I always make it a point," said
the man with a wart on his nose, a
couple of cross eyes and a hair lip, but
otherwise possessing a perfectly good
face, "to say polite and complimen
tary things to the ladles. It does me
no harm, and I notice it always gives
them a lot of pleasure. My motto Is
to scatter sunshine provided It costs
no money as I Journey nlong."
"I used to do that, too," said the
man whose set of neglected whiskers
were calling plaintively for the lawn
mower, "but I have been broken of
the habit. No more sunshine radiat
ing from these quarters."
"And what cured you?" asked the
other.
"A couple of breach of promise
suits."
RED FOX WITH WHITE FEET.
"Rarer Than a White Blackbird," Says
Lucky Trapper.
A big red fox with four white feet
was trapped by John Hall of Sher
man, Conn., the other dny. Hall, an
experienced trapper, says a fox with
white feet is rarer than a white black
bird and that he will get a good price
for tliis, one of the biggest foxes ever
seen about Sherman. He lias it in an
iron cage with three other live foxes
and four rac< oons.
Hall has been very lucky this sea
son. While hunting a few days ago he
shot two raccoons, together weighing
fifty pounds, in one tree. lie has trap
ped twenty-two foxes, besides other
animals. He has fourteen live skunks
in a cage. He can handle the skunks
without worse result than If they
were chickens.
Plant That Weeds.
Scientific agriculturists are taking a
great interest Just now in a pretty
jilant with blue flowers, the Comma
llna nodlfiora, for this plant eats up
weeds. The plant comes from Mala
ela, where it Is of great service in ex
terminating the lalang and other
weeds inimical to rubber growths. In
the English botanical gardens at Kew
tests have proved It to be equally pow
erful against the weeds of a temperate
climate, and in Washington the Kew
demonstrations are being duplicated.
The commellna grows rapidly, nnd
tvoeds disappear before It.
Some men are rtch enough to afford
every luxury except a clear conscience.

AVERTED A DUEL
The Soft Amwer That Was Returned
to the Challenge.
Mrs. Minnie Walter Myers, in ber
"ltomance and Realism of the South
ern Gulf Coast," gives an account of
one of the last challenges to a duel
which occurred in Louisiana. The af
fair was between M. Marigny, who be
longed to one of the oldest families of
Louisiana, and a Mr. Humble, a sturdy
ex-blacksmith of Georgia, who had be
come a man of political consequence.
Mr. Marigny took offense at some re
marks of the Georgian and sent him a
Challenge. The big ex-blacksmlth was
nonplused.
"I know nothing about this dueling
business," he said. "1 will not fight
him."
"You must." said his friend. "No
gentleman can refuse."
"I am uot a gentleman," replied the
honest son of Georgia. "I am only a
blacksmith."
"But you will be ruined if you do not
fight," urged his friends. "You wil!
have the choice of weapons, and you
can choose so as to give yourself an
equal chance with your adversary."
The giant asked time in which to
consider the question and ended by ac
cepting. He sent the following reply
to M. Marigny:
"I accept, and In the exercise of my
privilege I stipulate that the duel shall
take place in Lake Pontchartrain, in
six feet of water, sledge hammers to
be used as weapons."
M. Marigny was about five feet
eight inches in height, and his adver
sary was seven feet. The conceit of
the Georgian so pleased M. Marigny,
who could appreciate a joke as well as
perpetrate one, that he declared him
self satisfied, and the duel did not take
place.
STREET LIGHTS.
How Throughfares Were Illuminated
In the Seventeenth Century.
Lighting the street- of a large cit.v
in olden times was a far different
thing from the illumination of our
thoroughfares now. In 1601 the streets
of London were directed to lie lighted
with candles or lanterns by every
householder fronting the main road
from nightfall to 9 o'clock, the hour of
going to bed.
In the last year of King Charles ll.'s
i reign one Edward Honing obtained the
I right to light the streets with lanterns
j placed over every tenth door from C
I o'clock on moonless evenings until
j midnight between October and April,
j During the reign of Queen Anne in
| July, 1780, Mr. Michael Coke Intro
| duced globular glass lamps with oil
i burners Instead of the former glim
j mering lanterns. In 1710 an act was
passed which enjoined every house
holder to furnish a light before his
door from 6 to 11 o'clock at night, ex
cept on evenings between the seventh
night of each moon and the third after
It reached its full.
Inn few years a company was form
ed to light the street from 0 o'clock
\ till midnight, each householder who
1 paid poor rates being required to eon
-1 tribute for this purpose C shillings a
j year.
Gaslight, at its introduction in the
beginning of the last century, present
| ed such a novel spectacle to the eyes
! of foreign ambassadors that they were
i vain enough to imagine that the bril
llant lamps were a part of a general
illumination to celebrate their arrival,

Light and Pain.
"Light Is good for toothache." said
the doctor. "Darkness is bad for it
If you are a toothache sufferer, haven't
you often noticed how the pain In your
jaw increases when late at night you
turn off the lamp nnd try to sleep?
Light, you see. is good for the tooth
ache. There are a number of diseases
It Is good for—asthma, cold In the
head, earache. These diseases in the
dark all grow worse.
"Darkness is good for a sick head
ache and for neuralgia and for nausea.
Haven't you noticed it? Light and
darkness—they are remedies recog
nized at last, and today we prescribe
them the same as we do quinine or
uux."—New York Press.
Ignorance of Our Customs.
"What caused the hitch In the prog
ress of the courtship of Miss Coynerox
by the duke?" asks one interested
party.
"He got the idea that her father
didn't have any money," explained the
other.
"But couldn't he look the mattei
up?"
"Ho thought he had. The trouble
was he looked at tha tax duplicate Just
after the old man had finished swear
lng off his assessment."—Judge.

Real Beefs In Sleeping Cars.
The new sleeping cars of the L.and
8. W. railroad in England are a dis
tinct departure from the ordinary type
of sleepers, says the September Popu
lar Mechanics. Brass bedsteads take
the place of the stuffy berths familiar
to all who travel In this country, and
heavy upholstery Is eliminated. This
renders the cars more hygienic and the
woodwork can be kept clean. The car
consists of seven single and two dou
ble sleeping compartments, extending
acroes the car, each of which has its
own lavatory.
American Humor.
American humor exists, It distin
gulshes the national character, it per
meates all our affairs. It is not ot
aboriginal descent. It was not brought
from England or Holland by the fa
thers. Its saving grace was lacking
under Puritan rule. The humor of
Dledrlcli Knickerbocker is all the
more taking because ■ 112 the absence of
all sense of humor In the subjects of
his chronicle. If our humor came over
from Erin in tlie first rush of immi
gration it was quickly adapted to Its
new environment. It was modified
and changed by now circumstances
and conditions, geographical, ethnolog
ical, atmospheric. Wherever It came
from It Is a boon which saves us from
a lot of ?y»edless trouble and worrv
MOROSINtTHEBANKER
Career of Italian Who Was Loyal
to Jay Gould.
A FOLLOWER OF GARIBALDI.
Got His Start In New York by Saving
Erie Official's Son—Rose to Fortune
From a Sailor Boy—Was Called
Gould's Bodyguard.
Giovanni I'. Morosiui, the well known
banker, who recently died at his home
in lUverdale, N. Y., was at one time
closely associated with the late Jay
Gould, through whom he built up a
fortune estimated at several millions.
In Mr. Morosinl New York has lost
one of its most picturesque figures. He
was born in Venice, Italy, In 1832, in
the stirring times which led lo the
formation of the present kingdom. As
a boy lie was an actor In some of the
hazardous events of the revolution. He
was a follower of Garibaldi.
Mr. Morosinl owed his first step on
the road lo fortune to his courage and
strength iu defending in the streets of
New York a boy attacked by a crowd
of toughs. He owed his later acces
sion to fortune to his fidelity to the
late Jay Gould in the latter's light
against being ousted from the control
of the Erie railroad. Of lute he had
been seen little in Wall street, but had
devoted his wealth anil leisure to the
acquisition of an art collection at' El
m his liiverdale home.
Mr. Morosini's father was a Vene
tian officer of Montenegrin descent,
and his mother was a noted beauty,
lie was educated at the Austrian Mili
tary and .Naval college of Venice and
distinguished himself by proficiency iu
i languages auci mttitury science. When
j the revolutiuu against the Austrian su
premacy broke forth in IS4S Morosini
was a boy, but ho joined the patriot
forces anil led a battalion of national
1 guards which he had raised at the
| siege of Malghera. lie was struck
i down by a shell, which left a scar on
j his head.
j For a time the Austrians conquered.
| and with many other young Italians
Morosini had to tlee for his life. First
he went to Corfu and then to Misso
longlii, l'atras and Smyrna. There he
j was almost induced to join the Turk
i ish army in Albania, when a lucky
j accident brought him to the notice of
the American consul. By his advice
lie decided to come to the new world,
and In 1850 he landed, a penniless
{ stranger, In Boston.
The California gold fever was then
at its height, and Morosini at first
planned to try his fortune in the land
| of gold, but Garibaldi was In Staten
j Island and attracted to his side the
young adventurer. For a time he work
ed in the patriot's candle factory, and
when that was abandoned he followed
j Garibaldi on his voyage to China and
j England. lie was only a sailor before
| the mast, but in Loudon he attracted
j the attention of Mazzlni and was pick
| ed out from all the crew by him.
Garibaldi went to Genoa and Morosl
! ul came back to New York. lie was
j still only a common seaman, and it was
i a mere accident which saved him from
: the life of a hand before the mast.
; One night as he was going home along
| one of the streets near the water front
he heard a cry of distress from a group I
i of boys. He saw a boy on the ground I
and others beating him. He broke I
i through the crowd, flung aside those |
who were tormenting the boy and up 1
braided them for their cowardice. Not j
a man came to his aid. The gang, re- 1
' covering from their astonishment,
closed In on him. lie struck out right
and left, felled four or Gve and drew
his long sailor's knife. Then with a
rush he drove his assailants back and
got the boy away from them.
He still expected togo to sea again
until, to his surprise, a day or two later
he received a visit from the boy he had
rescued. He turned out to be the son
of Nathaniel Marsh, secretary of the
Erie Railroad company, and he came
to bring Morosini to his father. Mr.
Marsh at once offered to help the !
young sailor and found him a place as j
office boy with the Erie company at a
salary of $:;o a month.
Mr. Morosini entered on his new em
ployment on May 2S. 1855. He was fat
too well educated to stay long in a
subordinate place. In a few years he
was appointed general auditor of the
Erie railroad and Its leased lines.
This brought him Into contact with
Jay Gould. lie first met him in 1868,
and a year or two later, when the
great fight for the control of the Erie
began, he threw In his lot with the
financier. It is said thut at the height
of the struggle the party at the head
of which was General Daniel Sickles
offered Mr. Morosini SIOO,OOO for a
transcript of certain parts of the rec
ords of the railroad. Mr. Morosini re
fused the offer and thus enabled Mr
Gould to retain his bold upon the road
liut when the Blschoffshelm party
obtained control the general auditor
found his place most unpleasant. At
length President Watson called upon
him to either give up his allegiance to
Mr. Gould or leave the company. He
chose the latter alternative and from
that hour was known as a trusted fol
lower of the financier.
Wall street regarded Mr. Morosini
as something more than a confidential
secretary to Mr. Gould, which was his
new title. Because of his huge frame
and well known strength he was called
Gould's "bodyguard." Many stories
were told of him In this connection,
and It was asserted that on one occa
sion a promoter who had penetrated
Into the Inner sanctum of Mr. Gould
and would not withdraw found himself
picked up bodily by the secretary and
dropped outside the door.
Her Indorsement.
"Madam," said the teller of a bank
In Baltimore to a woman who had
handed him a check to cash—"madam,
you have forgotten to indorse."
A worried smile came to the wo
man's face, but she took back the pa
per and wrote something on the back
thereof.
When again the teller looked at the
check ho found that the woman had In
dorsed as follows:
"The bank has always paid me
whatever It owed, and you need have
no worry. Therefore I indorse this
check. Very truly yours, Anna M.

A Superstition of the Mm Who Build
the Skyscrapers.
' These airy crews are a generous
t .Towd, says Erneßt Poole, writing in
I Everybody's Magazine of men who
work on skyscrapers. They earn high
pay. When working full time they
make $27 a week, and, like their rough
brothers out on the plains, they are
quick to give of their earnings. On
Saturday afternoons when they line
up at the pay window the Sisters of
Charity are always there, and quarters
and dimes jingle merrily into their lit
tle tin boxes.
Behind this generous giving Is a su
perstitious belief that amid risks like
these it is well to propitiate fate all
you can, for fate is a relentless old
machine, and when once Its wheels be
gin grinding no power on earth can
stop them. The "rule of three" Is cen
turies old. You may hear of It out on
the ocean, in the steel mills, in the
railroad camps and down in the mines.
And you find It up here on the jobs in
the skies.
"Relieve it?" said an old foreman.
"You bet they believe It."
"Do you?" I asked.
"Well," he said, "all 'X can sny is
this: It may be a spell or It may be
because the way of the whole crew is
expecting It. But, anyhow, when two
accidents come close together you can
be sure that the third ain't very far
off."
BIRD BREEDING FOR PLUMES.
By This Method Woman Hopes to Im
prove Millinery.
Breeding the ostrich and other plum
age birds for their feathers with a
view to "doing with the ostrich what
has been done with the chrysanthe
mum" is the plan of Mrs. L. 8. Ilertz
berg, who is establishing a breeding
plant at Huntington, N. Y.
"I do not know how my plans be
came known," said Mrs. Hertzberg.
"for I intended to start in on a small J
scale and work up quietly.
"This plume," she went on, taking 1
up a large ostrich feather, "Is what 1 '
am after. That Is really several feath
ers stitched together. It should be pos
sible to get ostrich plumes far heavier
than they are today. Several smaller
birds used In millinery will be raised
on the place. It seems to me that
birds carefully raised for thetr plum
age should produce feathers of a high
er commercial value than can birds not
so favored."
TO STOP FOREST FIRES.
Forester Wants Observation Towers
on Adirondack Mountains.
James S. Whipple, state forest, fish
and gauie commissioner, who Is con- !
sldorlng the future protection of New
York state forests against fire vlslta- j
tlons such as the recent disastrous ex- I
perlence In the Adlrondacks, will prob
ably recommend to the legislature that
funds be given hltn to establish obser
vation towers on the higher mountains ;
in order that fires may be detected j
more readily.
I Commissioner Whipple will urge a
! severe penalty for causing fires

j that locomotives used In the forests
J utilize a fuel other than coal. These

A LIVE COAL TRICK.
Teaches Natural Law, Yet Has All the
Appearance of Magic.
No one would suppose that It is pos
sible to bold a glowing coal on a piece
of linen or cotton without burning the
cloth, but that such can be done Is easy
for any one to prove, and at the same
time the experiment teaches an impor
tant natural law. Every child knows
that the telephone and telegraph wires
arc made of copper because that metal
Is a good conductor of heat and elec-
I trlclty, which is only another form of
heat, if a poker Is heated In the fire
you pick up a cloth to hold the outer
end, although It has not been in the
tire, because experience has taught you
that the heat is connected through the
metal from the fire to the outer end.
This experiment with the flaming
coal Is based upon this principle and
the additional one that linen and cot
ton are poor conductors of heat Take
a globe of copper and draw a piece of
cloth tightly over It so that there is
not a wrinkle at the top. If the linen
or cotton is closely woven the trick Is
ail the more certain. Theft, holding the
cloth tightly in place, you can safely
put a glowing coal on top of the cloth,
and, while It burns fiercely, the cloth
will not even be scorched.
The reason Is that the great conduc
tivity of the copper draws the heat of
the coal before it can burn the cloth.
Do not make this experiment with a
good handkerchief first, for If the cloth
Is not tightly drawn it may burn, but
take some worthless piece of linen or '•
muslin, and after you are certain of '
your experience you can astonish your i
friends who do not know the secret.- ;

Ornaments of the Peerage.
Lord Lyveden is an ardent peerage
reformer and tells an anecdote In this
connection for whose authenticity he
pledges himself. This narrates how a
famous statesman of the nineteenth
century was called upon to visit his
•on In prison. He bitterly reproached
him, remarking, "Heft am I, having
worked my way up from a middle
class home to a great position, and
When 1 die you will be the greatest
blackguard In the peerage." The son
listened quietly and then £ died, with
terrible Irony, "Yes—when you die."
Another of Lord Lyveden's peerage
Stories Is equally piquant. The son of
a peer irpplled to a friend in the north
of England for a housekeeper and was
recommended a certain Mrs. Brown.
The peer wrote to the woman accord
ingly to the effect that, having learned
particulars of her character, he was
willing to engage her as his house
keeper and making an appointment for
her to call and see him on a certain
date. The good woman replied:
My Lord—Prom what I have learned of
your character I decline to enter your
house. I am your lordship's obedient
servant, ANNE BROWN.

FIRST WOMAN MAYOR.
Miss Dove an English Suffragist Who
Has Made Good.
Among the women who have demon
strated ability to hold political posi
tions and run affairs still regarded by
many persons as suited only to men is
Miss Dove, who was lately elected mu
ticipal councilor of High Wycombe,
England, by the biggest majority in
the history of that town. Just think
of conservative old England getting
ahead of America by owning a "lady
mayor." Our sisters of the Political
league on this side of the water had
better sit up and take notice. Miss
Dove has always been a pioneer; in
deed, it has become a fixed habit with
her. She was one of the three women
who were first privileged to attend

of education for her sex. In her girl
hood. when cducatlou for women was
at a very low standard, she spent three
years at Queen's college. Rut at fif
teen years of age her family moved to
the country, and all instruction ceased.
Her next school venture was residence
at a boarding school and after that a
period of home life devoted to teach
ing her younger brother and sisters
and making their clothes. Suddenly
came the first great step in her educa
tional career, when her father, a cler
gyman, told her of Miss Emily Davies*
intention of starting a women's college
at Cambridge. Miss Dove passed the
entrance examination and was enrolled
as a scholar. After a successful uni
versity career she went as science mis
tress to Cheltenham, and later she
Joined the staff at the opening of St.
Leonard's school at St. Andrews. Scot
land. In 1882 she became head mis
tress and held that position for four
teen years. From St Andrews she
went to High Wycombe and put into
execution her bold ambition to estab
lish In England a school on the lines
of St. Andrews, and Wycombe Abbey
school, with its 240 pupils, is the splen
did realization of her ambition.
Now High Wycorabe, a quaint old
town In Buckinghamshire, has sot a
high seal of approbation on the re
markable career of this remarkable
woman by electing her Its mayor.
Long may she reign!
Maid and Mistress.
There are mistresses anil mistresses
Just as there are many maids of many
minds, and if there is to be harmony
lu the household (here must be an un
derstanding.
Having chosen a trained servant,
and presupposing. In the heart to heart
talk with her before she was engaged,
that she has been made fully aware in
a general way of what Is expected of
her. It Is unfair and not at all a test of
her capabilities to hamper her with
commands to do her work In "your
way."
If you find her broiling the steak for
dinner In the oven when you have
been In the habit of using the top of
the stove, do not reprimand her; wait
for results. The steak may be Just as
good or better than If done the other
way. What she accomplishes is your
affair; how she does it Is her own.
A great many housekeepers are alto
gether too conservative in adopting
fresh ideas. They get inlo ruts and
stay there. If a maid is to take real
interest in her work she must be al
lowed and encouraged to use pro
gressive methods. She cannot be
blamed if she refuses to carry out
many orders which originated in the
kitchen of twenty years ago.
Healthiest In the World.
"Despite the fact that hospital nurses
have extremely arduous work and are
exposed to nlmost every known con
tagious disease. I believe that they are
the healthiest class of people," said
Miss Goodrich, superintendent of the
Training School For Nurses at Belle
rue hospital. New York city, the other
day. "By that I mean they are less
(rabject to physical breakdown than
any other class of people. They have
fewer aches and pains than other peo
ple, and their general hfiilth is far
above the average of those who are
usually considered the healthiest —
farmers and workers who pursue out
door work. Even doctors, whose very
business Is health, are not as healthy,
as a class, as hospital nurses. Doctors
know well how to preserve their
health, but they almost invariably
abuse their constitutions by overwork,
Irregular hours and mental strain.
"The reason why hospital nurses are
the healthiest neonle Is not so much
oecause or the nature of their wort as
itis their regular hours for nleenlnak
I rttuug, exercising BUK working. J uey
have the correct amount of sleep every
twenty-four hours, the most nourish
ing and wholesome food prepared la.
the best manner, and, of course, they
live under the best sanitary conditions.
Their exercise and their work keeps
them in perfect physical condition,
and, as all hospital nurses have good
| j constitutions—they are not accepted
unless they have—illness among them
is almost unknown. The mortality
rate among hospital nurses is probably
the lowest of any class of people in
the world.
"It is regular living that makes
health and keeps It for one who al
ready has it, and there is no class of
people who live a more regular lifo
than hospital nurses."
What's My Thought Like?
A variation of the old guessing
game, "What's my thought like?"
may be arranged with the moralists.
To play it the leader begins by say
j Ing, "I am thinking of a proverb
| which illustrates," for example, "tho
j tendency of inferior characters to take
| advantage of any relation of author
! Ity." The other players are allowed
| to ask questions concerning It thus:
| A—How many words does this prov-
I erb contain?
| Answer—Nine,
j 15— Is it a familiar saying?
i Answer—Among the most familiar.
| C—How many times does the word
j "the" occur in it?
! Answer—Twice.
D—Does It begin with the word
"when?"
| Answer—Yes.
! E—And end with the word "play?"
! Answer—lt does.
F—ls there a mention of certain ani
mals in it?
Answer—There Is.
O—ls it "When the cat's away the
' mice will play?"
Answer—That is it.
To Alter a Child's Skirt.
In making garments for girls it is al
ways important to arrange for length
ening the same.
First.—One of the usual methods is
to have a series of tucks at the hem.
This is somewhat of a trimming and
later proves convenient by letting out
the tucks, one or more, as is required.
Second.—lf the dress or skirt is plain,
tho hem may be let down and a farms
put under.
Third.—lf No. 2 does not give sut!i
clent length, then, instead of faring
when letting out the hem, add an ex
tension hem that will give the neces
sary length, being careful to match
the design, if there Is any In the mate
rial. A row of featherstitching may
be made over the joining, or a finish
ing braid may be placed over It.
Fourth.—Several rows of Insertion
may be set In near the bottom of th?
skirt.
Fifth.—For girls a little older a cir
cular or pointed yoke may be putin at
the top of the skirt.
New Bridge Prizes.
Sachets are now given its bridge
prizes, so that the hostess who pos
sesses more of the virtue of hospitality
than money may entertain correctly if
only she has a large number of fresh
looking silk pieces at hand. Such lit
tle bugs are of all ulncn, Uii-j me
used to drop among the handkerchiefs,
the neckwear, the gloves and the lin
gerie. They are mounted over little
tine white linen sacks, which hold the
powder, and their ends may be fringed
and tied together with baby ribbon or
they may be faced or shirred into a
sort of rose effect. Sachets are espe
cially acceptable these days, when only
vague suggestions of perfume are per
missible.
Becoming Furs.
It is the easiest thing in the world
to fall into the mistake of thinking
that any fur is becoming to any wom
an. Nothing should be selected with
greater care than the fur. For in
stance. a sallow skinned, dark eyed,
dark haired woman will look the very
worst in sealskin. She should wear
the lighter shades of mink, red fox,
yellow fox and silver gray fox.
Red haired blonds can wear sealskin,
but the genuine brunette with dark
hair and eyes may wear golden and
light brown shades, such as mink, mar
ten. brown or yellow fox and chin
chilla.
A Papering Hint.
When patching wall paper don't for
get to preface operations by putting
the new piece of paper in the sunshine
to fade till it matches that on the wall,
I>on't cut the patch a neat square, but
tear it. The irregularity of Its edges
will runkc it less conspicuous.
To polish mirrors rub first with a
cloth wrung out of cold water and
then dipped in dry whiting. After
ward polish with a dry, soft duster.—
