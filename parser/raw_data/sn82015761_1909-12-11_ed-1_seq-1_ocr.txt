Death of Mrs. R. J. Arey
Death yesterday called Mrs R.J.
Arey, wife, of the Santa Fe division
engineer, who for the past four
years has been a beloved member
of the community and an earnest
worker in the Methodist church.
Sir. and Mrs. Arey came to San
Bernardino four years ago from
Williams, Arizona. In her quiet
unasuming manner she won many
friends who mourn her death. Dur
ing the latter part of May she was
taken very ill and for a time her
life was dispaired of. Her ailment,
however, so weakened her system
that she never fully recovered and
since that time she has gradually
declined despite every effort ty re
store her to her former health. It
was decided to try the mountain
atmosphere and she was taken to
Victor.vilje, from which place she
returned to die, the change not do
ing what it was hoped it would do.
r 1 1 -r
airs. Arey was Dorn in lowa in
1868 and for a number of years
taught school in Kansas and later
in Arizona, where she was married.
For fourteen years Mr. and Mrs.
Arey lived at Williams, Arizona.
In addition to her husband Bhe
leaves an eight year old boy to
mourn her loss, The funeral ar
rangements have not been complet
ed. Word is awaited from her
relntives in Arizona. San Ber
nardino Sun.
Mrs. Arey was well known in
this city where Bhe taught school
for several years. Here she was
married to Mr. Arey, who was then
the principal of Williams school.
Later he held the position with the
Santa Fe as assistant chief en
gineer, until four years ago when
he was transfered to SanBernardino.
While in this city she was a devot
ed member of the local Methodist
church, and was loved by all who
knew her.
William Mclntyre, the Flagstaff,
sheepman, is the brother of the
deceased.
Statehood for Arizona
President Taft in his message to
the sixty-first congress Monday in
urging the statehood bill said:
"The successful party in the last
election in its national platform
declared in favor of the admission
to seperate statehood of New Mexico
and Arizona, and I recommend
that legislation appropriate to this
end be adopted. I urge, however,
that care be ezcercised in the pre
paration of the legislation affecting
each territory to secure deliberation
in the selection of persons as mem
bers of the convention to draft a
constitution for the incoming state,
and I earnestly advise that such
constitution after adoption by the
convention shall be submitted to
the people of the territory for their
approval at an election in which
the sole issue ehj.ll be the merits of
the proposed constitution, and if
the constitution is defeated by
popular vote means shall be pro
vided in the enabling act for a new
convention and the drafting of a
new constitution. I think it vital
that the issue as to the merits of
the constitution should not be mix
ed up with the selection of state
officers, and that no election of
state officers should be had until
after the constitution has been
fully approved and finally settled
upon."
Albert and Otto Lebsch left on
No. 2 Monday evening on a sad
mission for Saginaw, Michigan, in
response to a telegram of the death
of their eighty year old father who
was run over and instantly killed
by a motor car. The particulars
of the sad accident; are lacking.
Full particulars of the death will
be published next week. The de
ceased had many friends in this
city who are sorry to hear of his
death.
H. L. Benham, forest ranger, ac
companied by his wife, were Flag
staff visitors on Tuesday.
MEXICAN SHOT AND
MORTALLY WOUNDED
A shooting affray occurred near
Jesus Quijada's saloon about 1:30
o'clock Wednesday morning and

der and another bullet just above
his right lung. The Mexican, who
who did the shooting fired three
shots, missing one. The would be
murderer then ran away and the
officers have not been able to find
him although a thoromgh search
was made for him. The officers all
along the line have beerr notified to
be on guard for the M( xican. It
is thought that he was 0 ut with a

Constable Postle, who sleeps in

to the scene oflbe shooting where he
found Bargas in a critical condi
tion. He at once summoned a
physician and notified Marshal

the missing Mexican began.
The wounded man before his de
parture for the county hospital gave
the following statement:
"He called me out of the saloon
and when I went out be eaid that a
man had been to bis house and
called him a liar. I told him to
bring the map out to prove the as
sertion. Then be stepped back and
pulled out a revolver to shoot. I
raised my knife in my own. pro
tection. I don't know whether I
cut him or not. He shot, aimiogat
my head, but missed. The second
shot got me here in my breast and
the third hit me in the back when
I was running away from bim. J
