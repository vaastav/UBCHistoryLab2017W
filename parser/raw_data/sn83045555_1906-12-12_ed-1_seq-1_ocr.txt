n rerlous matter In view of the great
calamity that has lately befallen the

to contemplate the bombarding of the

against the board of county school

Justification or pretext upon which

PRESIDENTS FUNCTIONS
Tho president la exercising I groat
many functions Joglslatlve execu I
tive and Judicial lawful and unlawful
coiutltutlonul and unconstitutional I I
ho Is possessed of the Idea that ho is
limo supervisor of all of tho public
schools of tho various states ot the
Union and ho seems to be lmprofnod
with this Idea because In tho very Inst
paragiaph of his message ho recom 1
mends the ibllshmcnt of shooting
galleries In all nf tho large public
fchoola of the country wo must either
ilbabiuc hIs mind of this fancy or wo
must let him know that we agree
nlreo
as to the omnipotence of his jurisdic
tion If hocin take possession of thl 1
public schotjts < 5f California and com
pel the stale to admit to thorn Jdp
anese students contrary to tho lawn
of California ho could with equal pro
prlety send us an amendment to them
Santo Domingo treaty nnd demand tho
ndmUflon of tho negro children of
Santo Domingo Into tho ivhll schools
of South Carolina or of any other
state of the Union
STATE OF TIm UNIVBRriK
Of course If tho people have come to
tho conclusion that everything that the
president recommends Is right thou
there Is hardly any ure In contesting
any of his propositions and Instead ot
conferring upon him time power to give
Congress Information of the state ot
tho Union wo might confer upon him
the function of furnishing his own pe
culiar views upon the entire state of
time universe and recommending any
Improvements or changes In the KCII
eril plan of creation that ho may deem
expedient from the craddlo to the
grave In fact time president upon
ulon
page 29 of his message anticipates the
cradlo and makes a recommendation
upon the state of this Union that tends
to place In his hands tho establishment
of time birth rate of the country Now
It we car only supplement this func
tion by giving hun complete jurisdic
tion over the death rate wo will thit
havo I rule on which hit ubiquity la
unclrcumHcrlbcd anti whose unlimited
possibilities tire beyond the reach of
human contemplation
Mr Rayner coincided with what tho
president had said In his message In
praise of tho Japanese His
Japln o 111 sympa
thies had he said been with them dur
InS the war with Russia and ho
thought It a great shame that Japan
should havo been overpowered In tha
conference room when she had been
victorious on tho battlefield He pro
