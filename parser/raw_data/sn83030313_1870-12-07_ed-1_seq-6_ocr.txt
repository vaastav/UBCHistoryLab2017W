Anotuse Notorious Thief was put out
of the way by Judge I'edford yesterday for
twelve year , and six months. This is about as
eJectual as banging, if tiie Sicg Sin^ author'.
lies are efficient and vigilant.
All Accounts from Taris and Versailles
agree in describing the conduct of the French
during the recent battles as heroic in the
extreme. Indeed, no greater proof of their
heroism is needed than the admission of King
William that they succeeded in carrying a part
of the investing line. They seem, however,
to have been most unskilfully handled, hence
tho Germ .ns were allowed to refoim and
receive reinforcements at the most critical
moment of the day. Nevertheless some of the
French charges were most brilliant. They
disprove the assertions c? confidently made
that Frenchmen of the present generation lack
the courage and dash ol their ancestors
of 1800.
The Policeman who captured a robber in
t? honso of ill fame recently seems to have
b 'en d 'tailed to lay in wait in the hous? until
tho robber should appuar. lie had male his
lodging there several nig'its before tho cap
ture of his man relieved liim of his unusual
berth. It is well enough to capture 'hieves
even when they are robbing house? ol ill fame;
but ii. seems a alrauge policy to detail otic of
the guardians of the public peace specially at
one of these honaes, which ought them ves
to ba "pulled," in or lor to 4'full"a thief whom

T.'ie Ilrtmvior ol llif Ni'W Domini m.
The President's Message affords a favorable
opportunity for considering the whole policy
of the britiah government towards the United
States tit the critical hour when the destinies
of tho republic wore under trial in the civil
war. That policy it is which is now bearing
Us legitimate and bitter fruit In the disgrace
ful conduct of tho Dominion towardB Ameri
can vessels nnd the attempts to close the 8u
Lawrence to the navigation of Amoriean citi
zens. The Presideut preserves, as is right, in
his official utterance the calm dignity and
reserve appropriate to his position. The
diplomat^ character of tho doenment he sends
annually to Congress prevents his probing to
the quick t!:o temper and tendency of an
unfriendly government. Such political sur
gery prefaces war; whereas the United
States are ho strong, and will soon bo bo irre
sistible, that we shall have our du<? and realize
our des inies without war by sheer political
weight.
A journal la not under tho same duty of
reserve and reliconce as the President, and
we hold it to 1)0 our business to signalize in
this ac ion of tho authorities tf the Dominion
the conception, so hostile to tho United States,
w'lich actua! >d the s'atesmen of England in
bringing about tho new North American con
federation. When our civil war broke out
En opean statesmen, short-sighted, jealens and
ill-informed, conceived that the moment was
come to arrest forever the development of the
Uaiied StateB into a ainglo great Power,
ruling tho w!to!o North American Continent.
There may have be?n no exact concert to that
end; but tho measures takm wero skil
ful aud might have prevailed if they had not
been in utter contradiction to the inevitable
mr.jestio march of events, and an attempt ?
Machiavelian in its want of principle ? to
make tho whole future history of North
America tho eamo scenes ol inevitable divi
sion and hostility which have always pre
vailed in Europe. Tho design had two great
features. One was tho creation of tho Mexi
can empire under Max:m!lian ; the other was
tho establishment of the new federation of all
the British American provinces aorta of our
own boundary line.
This confederation was founded expressly as a
choc k upon '.he U.ii'cd States, and much exulta
tion was expressed at tho time by British- states
man and journalists at the discovery of eo
exquisite a d ;vice for placing on the flank
of tho republic a Power which, together with
tho independent Southern confederation,
would forever insure the disruption of North
American. This foolish and unrighteous idea
still prevails in the British mind. Even so
late as last year Mr. Goldwin Smith, a resi
deut among us, and a sympathizer, according
to his f'eb'.e propessorial capacity, with our
institutions and o irse'vea, wrote a leltor to an
English journal in which he expounded with
approval thn precious piece of philosophical
statesmanship. It is not necessary to
quote the letter, but its drift was
that the hardy northernmost Americans,
with their simpler lives and more monarchical
tendency, would qualify aud balance the more
eff rvcscc'it and progressive republican Union ;
with more rubbish of that sort ; all showing
that tho quoition of inevitable supremacy on
this Continent was as sealed a bosk, at that lato
date even, to Mr. Goldwin Smith as to tho driest
English tory at home, whom ho bo hoartily
ficpises.
j Founded on ideas like theae>, and stimulated
| to assert themselves ridiculously in such a
direction as this, c7eQ by tho teachings of a
Goldwin Smith, wo cannot wondsr at the
unfriendly conduct, of Ihj authorities of the
New Dominion. We have it on tho authority
of the President that they are harassing
American fishing vessels with a severity not
practised heretofore, ?nd subjecting our ships
to exceptional legislation which must not bo
allowed to s'.and for a moment. They are
advancing pretensions and making laws to
enforce them which the British government
itpelf liaB not hitherto ventur d upon ? preten
sions which are little short of impudent. A
Btatnta of the Dominion prohibits the fishing
vessels of tho United Statos from having on
board any merchandise whatever except what
is necessary for such fishery, and subjects
them to seizure and condemnation if they
have ; enforcing this by police visitation and
intolerable inquisitorial proceedings. Such
policy must b3 resi-ted at once. It is simply
intolerable. It combines iniult and injury,
and seems mire calculated to bring about
trouble than to satisfy any legitimate interests.
But even more fligrant is the attempt
of the New Dominion to exclude Ameri
can citizens from the navigation of tho St.
Lawrence. The President show3 clearly t&at
this is counter to tho whole te::denov of inter
national action for seventy ye^rs all over tho
j world in respect of rivers whose course runs
throughout separata sovereignties. It is diffi
cult to understand the drift of push legislation
and policv, unless it aims at providing British
statesmen with a spurious equivalent in tho
settlement oi tJie Alabama claims. "As fi.it
isfaction for those," they inty say, "wo will
open tho St. Lawrence." Wo can hardly sup
pose them capable of such pettifogging; but
why, then, do they permit the New Dominion,
which the President rightly describes as irre
sponsible, to play such pranks as this? The
legislation ot the Dominion is subject to impe
rial v -to, and its policy is controllable by a
Governor General, appointed by the Crown.
It is their business to keep this over-lively
young Power iu order ; for they must be
perfectly aware themselves, and they ou?ht to
teach their subjects anl prolig6t in the
Dominion, that the theory of checking and
balancing and qualifying and harassing the
United States by a new North American
Deminion is blown to pieces forever.
This attempt to close the St. Lawrence to
American vessels is a plain recurrence to
ancienl barbarism in tho matter of river
navigation. Tho principle was solemnly
adopted at the Vienna Congress in 1815 that
river navigation should be free. And no moro
offensive and unrighteous application of the
opposite prine'ple can bj imagined than that
which pretend* to bar the greaf American West
and Northwest from access to the sea through
the basin of the St. Lawrcnce. The idea ai*d
the attempt to do so are so laughable and cou
tempiiblo thr?t they expose the Dominion and
En; land to the derision of all civilized man
kind. England cannot afford to irritate civi
iuc<l bejuimeut iu thw way. Upon thia subject,
at least, we ou?ht to be peremptory. The
Union ought to brook no action which deprive*
its citizens of the free navigation of the St.
Lawrence basin. The Interests and the dignity
alike of the United States require that this
should be set right without delay, and we are
satisfied that American opinion will back the
President in requiring of Great Britain that
these questions with the Dominion should be
settled forthwith in conformity with justice aud
American claims ; for the policy of the De
minion, an American community, ought no
longer to bo under the inspiration of dynastio
European, balance-of-power ideas, which the
undoubted supromacy of this republio makes
as much out of date on this Continent as the
cat-worship of the Egyptians.
The Occupation of Itouea*
The capturo and occupation of the ancient
city of Rouen opens up to the Prussians the
flower garden of Normandy, one of the richest
and moat beautiful provinces of France. 1$
givc3 them a fresh granary from which to draw
supplies ? one iu which the hoof of a uhlan's
horse has never trod. It threatens Havre,
the most important commercial seaport town
in France except Marseilles, and cuts off com
munication entirely between that city and the
interior. The close approach of the enemy, at
Rouen, which is only sixty miles distant from
Havre, will keep that port in a tremor of
doubt nnd fear that is apt to paralyze the im
monsa importing business that finds way into
France through its harbor. Thus the invad
ing force makes its llrst advance towards that
destruction of commerco which Prussia has
herself so severely felt by the blockade of
German steamers in foreign ports. The cap
turo of Havre would divert commcrce from
all parts of the world to some other seaport
of France, or close it up altogether. The
occupation of Rouen is important in many
other rcspects. It is the seat of some of
the most thriving industries of Franos. It
is especially celebrated for the manufacture of
broadcloths and velvets and for the spinning
and dyeing of woolien and cotton stuffs. To
paralyze industries like these, and to cut off
commercial interests liko those of Havr?, such
immense sources of revenue to the govern
ment and to the people, is to extract the bone
and sinew of Franc?, and to break the back
bone of tho resisting power becomes an easy
matter.
In one respect the fall of Rouen is a matter
of mora than usual regret to tho French. Pe
culiarly a sentimental people, devoted to t!ie
dramatic fitness of thi.igs, tho fact that the
city is rich in historic interest makes its cap
turo more bitier to their Busccptive palates.
The heart of Richard Cceur ds Lion rests in
the Ronen Cathedral, bequeathed to it by the
great Crusader hini3elf for the love he bore the
Normans, and the ashes of tho Maid of Or
leans, who saved France and her King, were
thrown into the river at this point. That the
phlegmatic German Bfcould trample through
a city made sacred by these historio reminis
cences is enough to make Gambetta and the
gushing sentimentalists of the Tours govern- .
meat doubt the truth of history, or else won- j
der that tho Crusader's heart still lie3 pulse- :
less in its t?mb, or thai the ashes of La Pu- |
celle do not glow with a white beat even at j
the bottom of the Seine.
Old World JUuiun on tbc Caxtcrn Q'ie.i
tlsn I'ridn.
The European mail of the 2i"th of Novem
ber, which arrived yesterday evening, reports
the opinions of quite ft number of the person- j
ages who direct or control the public affairs
itnd mind of the Old World peoples on the
subject-matter of the Eastern crisis. Earl
Ru3sell, Lord Shaftesbury, the Duke of Cleve
land, Mr. Knatcbbull, 31. Thiers and others
are reported in our columns to-day. The
communications reveal the fact that the
Russian movement on the subject of the
revision of the Treaty of Paris and towards
the Bosphorus was undertaken at a critical
or "supreme" moment in the interest of
the Czar. They also tend to confirm our
first indication that Russia is likely to gain
her object eventually through the present
existing doubts and distractions of tbo
cosigners of the Treaty of 1856. The news
paper revelations brought forth a very curious
political reminder in the shape of the repro
duction of a brief uote which was published
by Thomas Carlyle on the subject of the
American war in 1863 ? the very darkest
moment which occurs in the history of the
struggle for the Union.
King William's report of the battle near
Orleans and the French account from Tours
make it certain that the French Army of the 1
Loire was worse beaten than appeared from '
the first despatches. The loss of thirty pieces I
of artillery at the present time, when, by Gam
betta's admission, they labor under the disad
vantage of not possessing many guns, is a
severe blow to the French. By the way, it is
surprising that our government has not availed
itself of the present opportunity to get rid of
a part of the immense park of artillery in our
arsenals. We must certainly have more than
two thousand pieces, from the old-fashioned
six-pounder smooth-bore to the terrible
twelve-pounder rifled Parrott.
It is A Standing Belief of the French that
every General of theirs who is beaten is a
traitor. Napoleon, Bazaine, Leboeuf, Can
robert and the rest are traitors or they never
would have Buffered defeat. Cambriel also is
a traitor or he would have permitted the Gari
baldians to ride rough ahod over him. The
last traitor is De Paladines, even he who was
the idol of last week. We place him in the
list because the French already talk of having
him conrt-martlalled. All idea that the Ger
mans are mainly responsible for the defeat of
their armies is scouted by the people. It is
impossible. And so the poor generals get the
blame.
The Isolation of Havbe from th? re3t of
France is doubtless caused by the occupation
of Rouen by General Manteuffel's army and by
the presence of tho Germans in the depart
ment of Eure, on the southern side of the Seine.
It is scarcely probable that an attempt will bo
mado to capture Havre. The city is situated
at the ond of a peninsula bounded by tho ocean
on the one side and the estuary of tho Seine
on the other. Besides its fortilications Havre
is defended, or can be, by the French fleet,
whose (Ire can easily sweep all the approaches
to the eUz*
The Heroad Dmy ot (<n>ct<-m.
The process of organization went on vigor
ously and harmoniously enough at tha Capitol
in Washington yesterday to encourage the belief
that our national legislators raally "mean biiSS
j ness." However, remembering the old adage
about "new brooms that sweep clean,'' we
shall wait in fear and trembling for further
developments beforo giving way to jubilation
on the subject. It is to be hoped, however,
for the profit and credit of tho. nation, that
at a moment of suoh profound interest to
both Continents the bearing and action of the
American Congress will bo such as to confirm
the reliance that our people place in k at
home and impose respect upon tho warring
and agitatod communities abroad. Christen
dom? nay, wo may add the whole world? is
convulsed while we write as it rarely has
been since the commencement of the Christian
era. Three great races are struggling for
unity under liberal laws and with forms of
government assimilating gradually to our own.
One mighty nation which, ju3t ai tho accond
session of the present Congress was
closing, stood at the head of existing
military empires is now struggling for
existence as a republic; another holding
at that same hour but a second rate position
lias become, indubitably, arbiter for tho time
being of European peace or war; a third, pre
viously divided and crippled, lika a body with
a half-paralyzed heart, has resumed pos39s
sion of its whole territory, and claims a high,
decided rank among settled and established
Powers. Meanwhile the United States have
gone forward in the path of complete recon
struction, on the basis of equal rights under
the law to all men, and propitious seasons
have combined with skilful labor to terllliza
their fields, beautify their cities, fill all their
granaries and throng their marts. Liberty and
pionty aro seen hand in hand, awaiting wisdom
to perpetuate their reign.
Such a situation, we repeat it, calls for a
peculiarly dignified, and at tho same timo
industrious, attitude on the part of thoso who
take counsel together for tho honor and safety
of the Groat Republic. Tho eyes of other
nations, now in tho very agony of supreme
trial, are turned to ub for light, and as wo
shall do at this hour so may they be influenced.
Washington swarms with agents, lobbyman,
land jobbers and social creatures of prey of
every class, who have gathered in from all
points of tho compass to pluck out the eyes
and pick the bones of the expiring Forty
first Congress. The harvest is ripe,
they believe, and tho revol they expect
to bo cora;>!ote while tho custodians of' the
country's interests aro diverted from their
watchfulness by preparations for an early
departure. But wo trust that this lim; these
ill-omened birds are to ba mistaken in the
result, and that in the presence of events
which admonish ail free governments to clo3cr
heed and more diligent work they aro to
receive a check severe and decisive.
The Senato mat at the usual hour and pro
ceeded quickly to business, the salient features
of which were the introduction of a bill to
repeal the sections of the act of 1870 continu
ing tho income tax after the 81st of December
last, and Mr, Sherman's resolution calling
for documentary information from lb a Secre
tary of the Treasury touching the transportation
of foreign goods in bond to Canada through
this country.
The House was enlivened l,y the Installa
tion of three now members Ailing vacancies,
and by a lively muster of land grant specula
tor.'?, who soon began to show vigorous signs I
of life. Three bills to repeal the income tax
were introduced ? the first droppings of a
shower that may be expected? and then the j
St. Croix K ver Iiai!ro3d grant was taken up !
and explained by Mr. Wilson, of Minnesota, j
who announced the quantity of acrc3 required
to be no more than a million. This quiet
demand was debated amid determined oppo
sition and a little strategy among outsiders,
and was at last laid on the table by 89 to 80.
Mr. Reeves, of this Slate, offered an excellent
shipping bill worthy of future special notice.
Mr. Logan, of Illinois, carried o.T t'ie scn3a -
tional honors of tho sitting by his proposal to
abolish the office of Admiral iu our navy alto
gether, and that of Vice Admiral bo soon as a
vacancy shall occur ? a movement that looks
very much like rods in pickle for two or three
dignified and prominent Vikings of this repub
lic. Mr. Ilalo objected to so summary an on
slaught, but Mr. Logan only grew fiercer from
opposition, and announced that he should
move suspension of the rules on Monday next
and urge the passage of the bill. Retrenchment
was again honored by the revival of the kiil
abolishing the franking privilege; vigilance
lifted her head with Mr. Huld.oman> of Pdan.
sylvania, who ?*br*u 0 resolution to investi
gate the correctness of tho census returns, and
offended national pride found a voice in Mr.
Banks, of Massachusetts, calling upon the
Navy Department for its correspondence with
Rear Admiral Poor, on the West India station,
relative to the search of American vessels by
the Spaniards during the first six mouths of
the present year. The latter polut has an
American glitter to it. Can it be possible that
we are, at last, to havo a spirit in Congress
rising so high and speaking such round, sono
rous words, so full of meaning for the people
that the Cabinet and the national legislature
snail bo discovered side by side in protecting
the treasure, fostering the commerce and vin
dicating the dignity and the honor of the na
tion?
The Eiue Litigation before Judge Barnard
yesterday produced a very sharp discussion
between the learned counsel, in which the lie,
modified and angar-coated, was bandied very
frequently, though always in that spirit of
caution and regard to future con3e<ficnces
which induced the old bachelor, who dreaded
a suit for breach of promise, to si^n all his
letters to his sweethuart "Yours, without
prejudice." The residt of tho case was that
Ramsey and Tailer wore discharged and the
case against the others was adjourned until
Monday.}

As the period approaches for the annual
assembling of the "congregated wisdom" of
tbe Sta'e at Albany, speculation becomes rife
in regard to what may or may not be done
during tbe session.
The political character of the body may be
set down as democratic, although an exceed
ingly meagre majority can be claim ad by that
party. Giving the Senatorial vacancy occa
sioned by tbe d?ath of Senator Biool to the
republican*, a tie may be found in tbe Senate,
but the casting voto beln^ in the hands of the
presiding ofllcer (the democratic Lieutenant
Governor) it is safe to assume that all promi
nent measures will be docid id in favor of the
democrats. The House, with perhaps only
one majority, maybe couatod upoa as suro to
"stick" to the demoovacy withont fear of
combinations hostile to Tammany In the
shape of boiling young democrats, or "hay
mow and cheesepress" democrats, or "huck
leberry" democrats, or any other kind of
democrats tho financial interests of mem
bers may have given birth to at tho last
session. As a loading republican in this city
remarked tho other day, w';ea tho conversa
tion (urned upon the clo3:ne:?s of party lines
in tho ensuing Legislature, "So much the bet
ter; there will be so many the les3 repub
licans for the democrats to b'iy up."
The Lrjijlaturo, beln; thai ussurod to the
democrats, with democrats occnpyiag tho Ex

government, with a s ronj probability that all
the principil offices ia both houses will bo

have passed out of existence tho past
year or which may be In full operation
for t.iu coming year-all, with but few excep
tions, have expressed an open and decided
preference for Governor Hoffmin us tho
national democratic sLnniarJ bearer In tho
next Presidential conto3t. H^nss tho
Governor may step a little way out of tbo
usual tracfe in bl3 forthcoming message and
enlarge upon alters of mar: :es;ra: int Gi o -t
t j an mere local topics and which are barely
toucilfd upon in the usual anuual addresses of
-Late Executives. He way astonish some
democrats by taking strong grounds in favor
of tho fourteenth and fifteenth amendment
and in insisiing that our colored population
have accorded to them the rights guaranteed
by tuoso amendments. IIe may hav* some
thing to say in relation to tha administration of
General Grant. Ho may endeavor to show its
irresolution in suc'i matters as the Alabama
claims, the recognition of tho ind.peml nee of
Cuba, as wall as its shortcomings and fast
going? in other respects, as will inspiro the
democratic hosts all over tho land with strong
hopes for triumphant success in 1872. He
may talk in a patriotic strain about tho
intrusion of federal bayonets and federal
hireling* at our local elections. He may
explain away charges of corruption pre
ferred against tho democratic management of
the party in this State that wiil help the cause
among pious people and olhers who discoun
tenance anything but purity and integrity in
conducting public affairs. He will, ia brief,
have a One opportunity of ripping up soma of
the dead and rotten planks in the old demo
cratic platforms and of supplying tluir places
with good, sound timbar, well impregnated
with the preservative? or, if we uTay fid
express it, the "carbolic acid"? q-,alitiea
of practical and progressive doctrines? doc
trines suitable to tho times and the grow
ing magnitude of tbo American republic.
Here is tho opportunity for Governor Hoff
man to show his hand. As the head of tho
democratic party ho will bo held responsible
for all corrupt legislation unless ho interposes
his veto. He must look out for the schemes
of tho railroad monopolists. Ha must take a
manly stand against, all sorts of jobs He
must assume an elevated and statesman
like position upon all public measures
and while ho infuses confidence into
the ranks of his own friends the re
publicans may learn that unless they bestir
| themselves "right smartly" they may, with
an <he> personal popularity and military
renown their distinguished chieflain enjoys,
have to struggle hard to retain their grasp
upon the reins of nation*] power when their
present lease expires.
In the meantime wa supp033 we may ??a*I
cip&te some reforms, including the total abol
ishment of the election Registry law (to the
operations of which the city of New
| York is made especially liable), and
| the usual amount of lobbying at the
coming session of our Legislature; but as
that business has been reducad to a regular
profession instead of being aa occult science,
| whoso mysteries were once known only to a
select few, we hope tho moral sense of
the peoplo will not be shock ul, as it has
hitherto been, by tales of legislative corrup
tion, oi bad practices, in the performance of
which each party may be pronounced equally
guilty. Let tho democrats give us an honest
Legislature this winter, just a3 wo had an
honest eloc'ion last November, and the wis
dom of the course will be found in their
receiving the warm approval of their con
stituents and their own consciences, and ia
the just acknowledgments of the community
at large. ^
The Hpfindid 1-1 and of fit. Itomlugn?The
Texas Aanetmtlon PIhu.
In the President's Message no proposition
ma le is so earnestly, forcibly and convincingly
presented as bis proposition looking to tho'
annexation of the splendid tropical island o t
St. Domingo, beginning with that important
division known as the repttblic of Domiuica.
The annexation treaty bavin; failed la tbW
Senate at the last session, the ratification re*
quiring a two-thirds vote, General Grant now'
proposes that by joint resolution of the two'
houses of Congress the Executive be au
thorized to appoint a commission to negotiate
a treaty with the authorities of St. Domingo
for the acquisition of that islaad, and that an
appropriation bo made to defray the expenses
of suoh commission. The question may then
ba determined by the action of the two houses
of Congress upon a resolution of annexation,
as in the caso of Texas.
What was the cast) of Texts ? The republic
of Texas had been acknowledged by Mexico ;
bat tbore remained a boundary dispute which
threatened war, when, nnder Tyler's adminis
tration, a treaty for the annexation of Texas
was submitted to tho Senate and rejocted. In
1814, however, tho annexation was made n
plank in tho democratic platform, and upon
this plank Polk was elected. Bat before Polls
came in (spring of 1845) a joint resolution
from the House providing for tho peremptory
annexation of Texas, war or no war witb
Mexico, wu3 submittod to tho Senate for its
concurrence. It was found, however, that
tliia peremptory resolution wo.ild not go
through ; that Senator Denton's vote and one
or two others were wanted and that they wero
opposed to annexing a war with Mexico. Tho
resolution was, therefore, softened with another
resolution providing first for tho settlement
of the Mexican boundary dispute, la tho dis
cretion of the President. As thus amended
the resolutions were finally passed and sub
mitted to t'ao President's approval (Tyler) on
the 3d of March, and Polk was to coma in tho
next day. Tho gjnoral understanding wa3
that Tyler would leave this business to Polk, to
whom it properly belonged, and that Polk
would adopt tbe alternative of ilrst settling the
Mexican boundary dispute. But Tyler could
not resist tho temptation of takiag the busi
ness into his own hands, aud bo ia tho night
of tho 3d of March he postel off his special
ambassador to Texas with tho peremptory
annexation resolution wiut tho boundary
claimed by Texas.
Hence, from this caprice of Tyler, tho war
with Mexico and a 1 its tremendous conse
quences down to General Grant in the White
House, and tbis Message of his proposing the
annexation of St. Domingo on the Texas plan.
But there is no Mexican difficulty here.
Tbe coast is clear, the island can ba ours for
a mere bagatelle, and wo are Bure that on the
Texas plan General Grant will triumphantly
carry through the annexation of this island.
TxiE Situation in Constantinople.
Our special correspondence by mail from C>n
stantinople supplies an interesting report of
tho general situation which existed in the
Turkish capital on tho 12th of November.
Tno American interest was evidently a vivify
Inj utkd refining element, both in politics and
the social circlo. Tho Hon E. Joy Morris, ex
Ministor of tho United States, received a
very complimentary address from his fellow
countrymen on tho eve of his d^par'.ure.
Some few Americans had taken out American
protection papers. A collego which has been
founded by an American is likely to produce
excellent educational results. General Igna
tieff, the Russian Minister, was expectod back
from St. Petersburg. The Eastern question ? ?
of which wo havo h id ao mush In our cablo
despatches since? had just come distinctly to
light. Tho Bourse of Constantinople was even
then seriously affected and the Porte Cabinet
agitated ? indeed, wo may say alarmed at tbe
prospect.
In One Respect at least the French hare
thus fur been unequalled einco the war began.
The delicate manner in which they report re
verses to tlioir arms is a model of official in
genuity. Since Gambetla naively announced
that the Array of tho Loire had ceased to
advance by reason of the resistance encountered
from the Germans wc have had nothing better
than the report from Paris of Friday's baltlo
before tho city. The result was a French
victory, the Pruseiaus retreating, leaving their
d *ad and wounded on tho field, after wlilca
Ducrot's forces recrossed the Marne unmolested.
Much stress islaid upon the fact that the Prus
sians did not oppose his crossing. The diplo
macy di3pluyed in the despatch will be appre
ciated when it is remembered that the oi ject
of the Prussian attach was to force the French
to rccross the Marne ? something they would
scarcely have douo had they baen victorious.
Hackmen ab Highwaymen.? It is state!
that one of our public Jehus recently drove a
lady in his hack from the St. Nicholas Hotel
to Central Park, and on the return gave her a
glass of water which was drugged. Sho
becamo unconscious, anrl, on awaking, four.d
hersolf in a strange place with all her jewels
and valuables gone, and the Jehu, of course,
missing. This is not a stranger story than tho
facts which are detailed every day of rob
beries in crowded Wall street or Broadway.
It would appear that a crowdad city is realljr
as favorable a location (or the exploits of the
unimproved Claude Duval as ever Hampstead
Heath could have been. We do not doubt
that Claude could put his pistol to a m in'i
head in the h^rt of our great city and make
him stand and deliver, without fear of outside
interference, merely beo^u-e nobody In busy
Gotham cares to interfero with tho duties of
the regular police.
Mr. Sumner at the Currency Agai>,? ?
Mr. Sumner is one of those restless individuals
that must be meddling. He is not satis
fied to let well alone, but wants to bo m iking
experiments 011 some fanciful theory. It is
the same with tha currency as with everything
else. We are gradually and healthfully ap
proaching a specie ba<ii, us the decline in gold
within the last y;'ar Bhowi, without disturbing
business or values, and it i ( certain that if tho
currency be left to the laws of trade and tha
growth of the country we sh ill roach a specie
basis soon enough. Wnv, ther, legislate upon
, tho quedliou at all? Whir brimr it i'aforo Coa
