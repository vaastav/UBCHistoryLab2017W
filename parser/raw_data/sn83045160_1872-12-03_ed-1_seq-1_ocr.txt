to meet such convictions by asserting
that water, not fire, overwhelmed Her

attending the determination of oar admitted

legiance lo the resisective Oovernrnenu, point
to Un importance of establishing by natural
objects or other monument the actual line
between tbe territory acquired by purchase
from Ku via ami the adjoining possesions of
Her Kritlanlc Majesty, tbe region Is now so
sparsely occupied that no conflicting Inter
est of individuals or of jurisdiction are likely
to interfere tothedelay or enibaissment of

tslnce your last session th rrrsldent of tbe
Mexican Kepuhlic. dlst'eaished by his high
character and Ha r' ervl-HM to his country,
has dlcl. s'-i his temporary successor has
ns Teen elected with great unanimity by
the people a proof of confidence on their
pan in his patriot cm and wlwlum which, tl
la believed, will he crmnnnecl by the results of
hlsadmlnlstrattcn, It Is particularly desira
ble that nothing ahonld be let-, undone by Ibe
fnvernment of either republic to strengthen
heir relations as neighbors and friends. It Is
nlurh to 1m? regretted that many lawless acts
continue io disturb the quiet of the settle
ments on the border between our territory
and that of Mexico, and that complaints
ol wrong lo American ciUzens ln various
parts nf ine country are made. The revolution
ary cnaditlon in which the neighboring Re
public has so long been Involved, has lnsome
degree contributed to this disturbance. Ills
to t.e hoped that with a more settled rule of
ord. r through the KepuMir, which may be
expected from the present Government, the
acts of which Just complaint Is made will
cease. The proceedings of the Commission
nnerthe Convention with Mexico, of the
sixth of July, la on the subject of claims,
have unfortunately been checked by an ob
stacle, for the removal of which measure
have been taken by the t wo Governments,
which tt Is believed will prove successful.
The Commissioners appointed pursuant to the
Joint Resolutions of Congress of the seventh
of laay last, to inquire into the depre
dations of the Texas frontier have diligently
made investigations ln that quarter. Their
report upou the subject will be communicated
to you. Their researches were necessarily in
complete, partly on account of the limited
appropriation mde by Congress. Mexico, on
the part of their government, has appointed a
stmiinr commission lo investigate these out
rages. It Is not announced officially, but the
press of that country state that the fullest in
vestigation Is desired, and that the co-operation
of all parties concerned Is Invited, to
seenre that end. I therefore recommend thai
a special appropriation be made at the earl lest
day practicable, to enable the Commissioners
on the part of the United Mates to return to
their labors without delay. It is with regret
that I have again to make announcement of
a continuance of the disturbed condlUon of
the Island of Cuba. No advance toward the
pacification of the discontented pari of the
population ha been made.whlletbe insurrec
tion has gained no advantage and exhibits no
more of the element of pswerorof the pros
pect of ultimate success then were exhibited a
year ago, while elpaln on the other
hand . has not succeeded In ita repres
sion, and the parties stand apparent
ly In the same relative atlltnde which thev
have occopled for along time. This contest
has been started now for four years. Were it
seen at a distance from our neighborhood, we
might be indifferent lo Its results, although
humanity could nol be unmoved by
mjiiiv of its incidents, wherever thev
niighl occur. It is however at our door.
I cannot doubt that the continued main
tenance of slavery ln Cuba Is among the
strongest inducements for lhe continuance of
tbe strife, and this terrible wrong Is the natu
ral cause of a terrible evil. Tbe abolition of
slavery and the Introduction of other reforms
in the administration of the government in
Cutis could not fall to advance the restoration
of peace and order. It is especially to be hoped
that the present liberal government of Hpain
will volnntalily adopt this view. The law of
emancipation which was passed more than
two years since has remained unexecuted ln
the absence of regulations for its enforcement.
It was but a feeble step toward
emancipation, but It was the recog
nition of right, and was hailed as such,
and exhibited Spain ln harmony with
sentiments of humanity and of justice and
sympathy with the other powers of the civil
ized world. Within the past few weeks the
regulations far carrying out the lawsof eman
cipation have been amended, giving evidence
of the sincerity of the Intention of the pres
ent Government txr carry into effect the
laws of 1870.. I hare nol failed to
urge the wisdom, the policy and the Justice
of a more effectual system for the abolishtion
of the great evil which oppressed a race and
contiones a bloody and destructive contest
close to our border as well as the expedlencv
and that Justice of conceding reforms of which
ii.- propriety 1 not questioned, deeply im
pressed with the conviction the con
tinuance of slavery! is one of the most
active causes of the conUnuance
of the unhappy condition in Cuba. 1 regret
to believe that rlllzens of the I" nited
s- or those claiming to Is- such, are large
holder in Cuba,of what Is there claimed as
property, but which is forbidden and de
nounced by tbe law of the United .states.
They are thus in defiance of the spirit of our
own laws contributing to the continuance of
this distressing and sickening contest, in my
1hI annual message I referred to this subject,
and I again recommend such legislation as
may be proper to denounce,and if nol prevent,
at least to discourage American citizens from
holding or dealing Tn slaves.
It Is gratifying to announce that the ratifi
cation of the convention conducted under the
auspice of this Government. IsMween Japan
on the one part, and the allied Republics of
the Pacific on the other, providing for an ar
mistice . have been exchanged. A copy of the
Instruments is herewith submitted. It is
hoped this may be followed by a permanent
peace between the same parties.
The differences which at one time threat
ened the maintenance of peace between
Hrail and tbe Argentine Republic It is hoped
are in the way ol ailslaclory adjustment.
Willi ti e, states, as with the Republics or
Central and Houth America, we coutinue to
maintain the moat friendly relation. It is
with regret, however, I announced that the
government of Venezuela has made no fur
ther payment on account of the awards un
der the convention of the twsntv-flfth of
April, lWkj. That Republic Is understood to be
now almost tranqulllzed. It is to be hoped
therefore that It will lose no time tn provid
ing for the unpaid balance of it debts to the
United Mates, which, having originat.-.! ln
injuries to it citizens by Venezuelan authori
ties, and having been acknowledged pursuant
to a treaty, ln the most solemn form
known among nations, would seem to
deserve a preference over debts of a different
origin, and contracted in a different manner.
II i subject is again recommended to lhe at
tention of Congress for such action as may be
deemed proper. Our treaty relations w ith Ja
pan remain unchanged. An Imposing em
bassy from that Interesting and progressive
nation visited this country during the voar
that Is paaeing, but being improvlded with
the powers for the signing of a convention In
th " country, no conclusion ln that direction
was reached. It Is hoped, however. Unit the
Interchange of opinion which took place dur
ing their stay in this country has led to a mu
tual appreciation of the Interests which mav
be promoted when the revision of the existing
treaty shall be undertaken. In this connection
I renew my recommendation of one year ago,
that to give Importance and to add to the ef
ficiency of our diplomatic relations with Ja
pan and China, and to further aid In retaining
the good opinion of these people, and to secure
to the United State its share of the commerce
that is destined lo flow between these nations
and the balance of the commercial world, au
appropriation be made to support at least four
American youths ln each of these to serve as a
part of the official family of our ministers
there. Our representatives would not even then
be placed upon an equality with the represen
tative of Great Rritaln, or of some otier pow
ers. As now situated our representi.tlves in
Japan and China have to depend for Inter
preter and translators upon native, of Ihose
countries, who know our language imper
fectly, or procure for the oeca-slou the services
of employes in foreign business houses, ur
tlie Interpreter of other foreign minister. I
renew the recommendation made at a previ
ous occasion, of the transfer to the De
partment of the Interior, lo which thev seem
more appropriately to belong, of all the
powers and duties in relation to the territories
with which the Department of Mtate. Is now
charged by law or by custom. Congress, from
the beginning of the government, has
wisely made provision for the relief of dis
tressed seamen ln foreign countries. No sim
ilar provision however ba hitherto been
made for the relief of oiUzens in distress
abroad other than seamen. It is nniierstexsl
to be customary with other government to
authorize Consul to extend such relief to
their citizen or subjects in certain oases. A
similar authority and an appropriation to car
ry It Into effect are commended in case of citi
zens of the United states. Under nch cir
cnmtanrstt Is well-known that such citizens
resort lo foreign countries in great numliers,
though some of them are ubl to bear the ex
penses incident to the locomotion, there are
onie through accident or otherwise become
penniless, and have no friends arjhome able to
su rthem. Person in this sliuatlou must
either perish or cast themselves upon the
tharity of foreigners, or be relieved at the
firivale charge of our own officers, who usual
y, even with the most benevolent disposi
tion, hav nothing to spare tor such purposes.
Should the authority and appropriation ask.-d
for be granted, care will be taken to carrv lhe
beneficence of Congress into effect, that It
shall not be unnecessary or unworthly be
stowed. Tbe money received and carried Into tbe

these great redactions and the

the expenditures of the Gi vernment In col

the n.-xt fiscal vear. It is very doubtful, how
ever, vt hcther "any fnrtber ri"rtldh of so
vexatious a northed Upon the people will be
prttca!)le for tbe present. At all event, as
aure ot justice to tlie holders of the na
tion's certificates of indebtedness, 1 would
recommend that no more legislation be bad
on this subject, unless It be to correct errors
of omission or commission In the present
ias.suntll sufficient lime line elapsed toprov
that it can be done and still leave a sunrcleut
revenue to meet the current expenses of the
Government, pav the interest on the public

aud as soon as practicable, having
due regard for the interests of the
debtor class, and the vicissitude of trade
and commerce, and convertable inlo gold si
par by the War Department. The report of
the secretary of War shows the expenditures
01 the War Department for the fiscal year end
ing June at, 1871, to be X35,79j)l 82, and for
the fiscal year ending June 30, 1872, to be
tj, rr2,l.".ii in, showing a reduction ln favor of
the last fiscal year of I27,8S4 2. The estimates
for military appropriations for lhe next liscal
vear, ending June 30, 1S74, are 3,380,137,878.
Tlie estimates of the Chief of Kngineers are
submitted separately for fortifications, river
and harbor Improvements, and for public
build in gs and ground, and the Washington
aqueduct. The affairs of the Kreedmeu's Bu
reau have all been transferred to the War
Department, and regulations have been put
Into execution for the speedy payment of
bounty pay, etc., due colored soldiers properly
coming under that Bureau. All war accounts
for monuv and property prior to 1871, nave been
examined and transmitted tothe Treasury for
final settlement. During the fiscal year mere
has beenfpald for transportation on railroads
81.30n,iXi, of which JS0.S.7 as over the Pacific
railroad; for transportation by water, S26,
378 52, and by stage, SttWT.i 81, and for the pur

loyal oltizens for Quartermaster's stores taken
during the war. Subsisting supplies tothe
smount of $80,018 12 have ben Issued to Indians.
The annual average mean strength of the
army was2l,l'H white and 2, 4P4 colored soldiers.
The 'total deats of soldiers for the year report
ed m ere 387 white and 54 colored. The distri
bution of the medical and surgical history
of the war is yet to be ordered by
Congress There exist an absolute necessity
for a Medical Corps, of the full number estab
lished by act of Congress of July 28, 1868,
there being now fifty-nine vacancies, and lhe
number ol successful candidates rarely ex
ceeds eight or ten ln any one year. The river
and harbor improvements have been carried
on with energy and economy, though many
are only partially completed. The results
have saved to commerce many times the
amount expended. The increase of commerce,
with greater depth of channels, greater secur
Ity in navigation, and tbe saving of time, adds
millions to the health of the country and In
creases the resources of tbe Government. The
bridge across the Mississippi river at Rock
Island has been completed, and the proper
site ha been determined upon for the Bridge
at ItCrosse. The able and exhaust
ive report made by the Commission
appointed to Investigate the subter
ranean lunnell has been transmitted
to Congress. The observations and reports of
the signal office have been continued, station
have fieen maintained at each of the princi
pal lake, river and seaport cities. Ten addi
tional station have been established ln the
United states, aud arrangement have been
made for exchanging reports with Canada,
and a similar exchange of observations is con
templated with the West India Islands.
The favorable attention of Congress is In
vited to the following recommendations of the
Secretary of War: A discontinuance of the
appointment of extra Lieutenant to serve a
Adjutants and Quartermasters; the adoption
of a code providing specific jienaltie for well
defined offences, so thai the lneqnality of sen
tences adjudged by court-martial be adjusted ;
a consolidation of accounts under which
exjicdltlons are made, as a measure
of economy; a re-appropriatlon of the
money for the construction of a depot at
San Antonio, tbe title of the sale being now
perfected. A special act, placing the ceine
tei y at the Cit v of Mexico on the same basis as
other national cemeteries; authority to pur
chass sites for military posts ln Texas; the ap
pointment of commissary sergeants from non-
"tmnisRioned officers; a measure for seenring
Lo.-further care and protection of supplies;
and an appropriation of the catalogues and
tablets 01 the anatomical section of lhe army
to the medical museum ; a reappropriatlon of
the amount for the manufacture of breech
loading arms, should the selection be so di
rect.! by the board of officers, to leave the
former the appropriation expended at the
Close ol the fiscal year; the sale of such ar
senal east of the Mississippi river
as can be spared, and the pro
ceeds applied to the establishment of
one large arsenal of construction and
rejsiir upon the Atlantic coast, and the pur
chase ol a suitable site for a proving and ex
perimental ground for heavy ordnance;
the abrogation of laws which deprive Inven
tors of the United states service from deriving
any benefit from their invention; the repeal
of the law prohibiting promotions in tlie staff
corps; a continuance of the work upon the
coast defences; the repeal of the Smith lec
ture: of tbe Act of July 13, lsi, taking
from Kngineer Jaldier the per diem granted
to other troops; a limitation of time for the
(.:',' a- on of substantial supplies under act
of July I, Ism, and a modification In the
mrsie of selection of cadets for the Military
Academy In order to enhance the usefulness of
the Academy, which is impaired by reason
of lhe large amount of time necessarily ex
pended giving new cadets a thorough kuowl
edga of the more elementary branches of
learning, which they should acquire before
entering the academy; also an appropriation
for philosophical apparatus, and au increase
in the number and the pay of the- milit&ny
acudemy band. The attention of Congress
wil: be called during its present session to
various enterprises for the more certain and
cheaper transportation of the constantly In
creasing surplus of the Western and Southern
products to the Atlantic seaboard. The sub
ject is one that will force itself upon the leg
islative branches of the government sooner or
lnt.r. and I suggest before that immediate step
be taken to gain all available information to
inevitable and just legislation. The route to
connect tbe Mississippi Valley with the At
lantic, with Charleston, south Carolina, and
sav annah, Georgia, by water, by way of the
Ohio and Tennessee rivers, and canals, and
slackwaWT navigation to the savannah and
Ocoraulgee rivers, has been surveyed and are
port made by an accomplished engineer of
the army. A second am! third new route will
be proposed for the consideration of C. ingress,
nsmely, by an extension of the Kanawha and
Jaines'river canal to the Ohio, and by the ex
tension of the Cliespeake and Ohio canal. I
am not prepared 10 recommend Government
aid lo t h.-se and other enterprise until it 1
clearly shown that they are not only of na
tional' Interest, bnt that when completed they
will be a value with their coat. That pro
duction Increases more rapidly than
the means of transportation in our
country has been demonstrated by past ex
perience. The rapid growth in population
and products of the whole country will re
quire additional facilities and cheaper means
tor the more bulky articles of commerce to
reach lide water; and n market will be de
manded. Tbe near future is equally demon
strable. 1 would therefore suggest either a
committee or commissioner to be authorized
to consider this whole question, and lo report
to Congress at some future day for Its better
guidance iu legislating ou the important sub
ject. The railroads of the country have been
rapidly extended during the last few years to
meet the growing demands of producers, and
reflect much red it upon the capitalists and
managers engaged.
In this connection. In addition to these, a
project to facilitate commerce by the building
of :i ship canal around Niagara Fall, on the
Unitisl states side, which has been agitated
for many years, will no doubt be called to
your attention this session, Ixxking to the
jo eat future ol the country and the increasing
demands of commerce, il might be well while
on tli Is subject not only to have examined and
resiied upon the various practicable routes
for connecting the Mississippi with the tide
water of the Atlantic, but the feasibility of an
almost continuous land-locked navigation
from Maine to the Gulf of Mexico. Sucti a
route along our coast would I..- of great value
at all limes, and of inestimable value incase
of a foreign war. Nature has orovlded Uie
greater part ot this route, and the obstacles to
he overcome are easily within tbe skill of
engineers. I have now alluded to this subject
with the view of bavins auv further exnendi-
ture of public moffry at this time than may be
necessary lo procure and place all the neces
sary information before Congress tn an au
thentic form to enable It hereafter. If deemed
practicable and worthy, to legislate on the
sunjeci witnoui ueiay.
The report of tlie Secretary of the Navy

The report of the Postmaster-General fur
nishes a full and satisfactory exhibit of the op
eralions of the Postomce Department during
the year. Ine ordinary revenue 01 me tie
partment for the fiscal year, ending June
SO, 1872, amounted to $2,1P1 ,542,637, and
the expenditures $2,8tij,81ij22i. Compared
with the p 1 e v I oils .fiscal year, the Increase nf
revenue as Sl87.83s.utii. or P37 per cent., and
the increase of expenses $226.808JaS, or ."Wiper

annual appropriation of $700,1100 for free mat
tor, aud the amount paid to the subsidies on
mail steamship lines from special appropria
tions, the deficiency oaid out of lhe General
Treasury was$3;il,77s,ijp, an excess of $3S,70.72
over th deficiency for the year 1871. Other
interesting statistical information, relating to
. ' i'.o ... oAiruiuaf- pisiui service, is lur

road mail routes on the thirtieth of lime 18T2
was 57311 miles, 8077 additional miles of such

Our postal communication with all part of
the country would have Iss-n placed upon a
moat advantageous footing by the improved
eot 1 convntim snd nrraneeiucnts re
cently concluded with he leading commer
cial countries nf Kurope and America, aud
the gratifying statement is made that with
the conclusion of a satisfactory convention
with France, the details of which nave been
definitely agreed to by the head of the French
postal department, subject to the approval of
the Minister of Plhanee. t.lttle remain to lie
accomplished by treaty for some time tocome.
With respect to the reduction of the rate on
Improved facilities for postal Intercom c,
your favorable consideration Is respectfully
invited to the recommendations made by the
Post master-General for an Increase of service
from monthly to semi-monthly trip on the
mall steamship route to Brazlf, for a subsidy
inside of the establishment of an American
line of mail steamers between San Francisco,
New Zealand and Australia; lor the establish
ment of Postofliee saving banks, and for the
Increase of the salaries of the heads of bu
reaus. I have heretofore recommended the aboli
tion of the franking priv ilege, and see no rea
son now for changing ray new on that sub
ject. It not having lieen favorably regarded
by Congress, however, I now suggest a modifi
cation of that privilege. To correct its glaring
and costly abuses, I would recommend the
appointment of a committee or commission
to lake into consideration tbe best method
equitable to private corporations, who have
Invested their time and capital In tbe estab
lishment of telegraph lines, of acquiring the
title to all telegraph lines now ln operation,
and of connecting this ervlce with the postal
Mvieeof the nation. It is nol probable that
this subject could receive the proper conside
ration during the limits of a short session of
Congress, but it may he Initiated, so that
further action may be fair to the Government
and to private parties concerned, There
are but three lines of ocean steamers,
namely: The Pacific Mail Steamship Compa
ny, between San Franclsi-o, China and Japan,
with provision made for semi-monthly ser
vice after October 1, 187.1; the United states
and- brazil I.iue, monthly; and the California,
New Zealand and Austrulia Line, monthly,
plying between the Unit.sl states and foreign
rjrta, and owned and operated under our flag,
earnestly recommend that such liberal con
tracts for carrying mails he autho-ized with
these line as will Insure their continuance.
If tbe exssiiency of extending the aid of the
government to lines of steamers which hith
erto have not received It, -hould be deemed
worthy of the consideration of Congress, po
litical and commercial object make it ud
vlsable to bestow such aid on u line, under
our flag, between Panama and the western
south American ports. By this mean much
trade now diverted to other countries, might
be nrougnt to us, to ine mutual advantage ot
this country' and those lying in that quarter
of the continent of America.
The report of the secretary of the Treasury
will show an alarming felling off ln our car
rying trade for the last ten or twelve years,
and even for the past yoar. I do not believe
that the public treasury con lie better ex
pendisl In the Interest of ftie whole people
than in trying to recover thl trade. Au ex
penditure of five million of dollar per
annum for the next five years would
restore to us our projKirtion of the carrying
trade of the world would be probably ex
tended. The price of labor in Kurope has tsseu
so much exhaust-si within the last five y ears
that the cost of building and operating ocean
steamships ln the United stales is not so
much greater than in Europe, that I believe
the lime has arrived for Congress to take this
subject Into serious consideration.
A detailed statement ol the disbursement
through tlie Department of Justice will be
furnished by the report of the Attorney-General,
and though they have Isi.n somewhat
lucreasea by me recent acts 01 cxniere 10 en
force the nghts of citizen of the United
states to vote ln the several States of the
I nlon, and to force the provisions of the four
teenth amendment to the constitution of the
1' need States, the necessary and salutary
effect of these enactments upon reckless and
careless men , 1 regr.-i 10 .-iy, imv e aociated
themselve in some localities lo deprive oilier
citizens of the right guarai.'.e.sl to them by the
constitution of the United Stutes, anil lothat
end have committed deeils of violence; but
the prevention and punishment 01 many of
these persons have tenil.sl greatly to the re
pression of such disorders. 1 do not doubt that
a great majority of tbe people ln all parts of
the country favor the full employ
ment by all classes of persons of these
rights to which they are entitled under the
constitution and the laws, and to invoke the
aid and Influence of all good citizens to pre
vent organizations wnose objects are o un
lawful means to interlere with those right.
I look with confidence to the time not far dis
tant, when the obvious advantages of good
order and peace will Induce an abandonment
of all combinations prohibited by the acts re
ferred to, and when it will be unnecessary to
carrv on Drosecutlons or inflict punishments
to protect citizen from the lawless doings of
such parties. Applications have been made
tome to pardon. persons convicted of a viola
tion of said acts, npon the ground that clem
encv in uch c-aaes would tend to tranquilize
the public mind and test the virtue of that
policy. I m disposed, as my sense of justice
will permit, to give to those persons a favora
ble consideration ;' but any anion therein is
nol to Is? construed as indicating any changc
ln mv determination to enforce with rigor
hws. so long as the conspirai le and
com blnatlous therein named disturb the peace
of the country'- It is much to be regretted,
and it is regretted by no one more than my
ell, thai a necessity has ever existed to exe
cute the enforcement act. oone can desire

The Secretory of the interior reports sat

seen of the several nur. aus unuer ine control
of tlie Interior Department. They are ail in
excellent condition. The work, which In
some of them for some years has been iu ar
rears, has been brought down te a recent date,
snd ln all the current business has la-en
promptly despatched. The isvllcy hlc-h was
adopted at the beginning 01 ine administra
tion, with regard to the management of the
Indians, has been as successful as Its must
ardent friends anticipated within so short a
time. It has reduced the expense of their
management, decreased their forages upon
the white settlements, tended to give the
largest opportunity to tbe extension of the
great railways through the public domains,
and pushing of settlement into more remote
districts of the country, and at the same time
improve the condition of the Indians. The
policy will be maintained without any
change, excepting such as further expe
rience mav show to be necessary to ren
der it more efficient. The subject of
converting the so-called Indian territory

and erecting therein a territorial form ot gov

question of removal to the territory within the

preliminary step to the organization of such
territory, tt will be necessary lo confine the
Indians now resident there to farms of pnier

will be made ln tbe immediate future to In

olreodv there. There Is no other location now
available where a people who are endeavoring
to acquire a knowledge of pastoral and agri
cultural pursuit can be as well accommo
dated a upon the uninterrupted lands ln the
Indian Territory.
A territorial government should, however,
protect the Indian from the Inroad of whiles
for a number of years until they became suf
ficiently advanced ln the arts of civilisation
to guard their own right and from the dis
posal of land held by them for the same
period. During the last fiscal year, there
were disposed of, out of the public lauds, 11,
884,tri5 acres a quantity greater by 1,0011,270
acres than was disposed of the previous year.
Of this amount 1,370,320 acres were sold for
caah; 380,480 acres e scaled with military war
rants; 4,071,332 acres tsJxen for homesteaus;
683,81.1 acres located with college scrip; .i.v.i.
887 acre granted to railroads; 48-VU7 acres
granted to wagon roods: 714,255 acres given to
states as swamp land ; 8780 acres located by In
dian scrip. The loaf receipt from all sources
ln the land office amounted to 3,218, lOOdurlng
the same period. 22,ulti,608 acres of the public
land were surveyed, which added to the
quantity before surveyed, amounted to 583,
38470 acres.leavlng l.eSH.saeacresof tlie pub

Interesting Information regarding their re
spective districts. They uniformly mention
lh. rrulrfnlness of the soil during the nast
season, and the Increased yield of all kinds of
produce evince those Slates and Territories
where mining is the principal business, while
agricultural products have exceeded the usual
demand, and liberal shipments have been
made to distant points.
During the year ending Sept ember 30, 1872,
there were Issued from the Patent office 13,-
82ii patents, 233 exclusion and 558 certificates
anil register of trade-marks; during the
same time 10.587 applications for patents, lu
eluding re-issue and designs, have been re

for patents have been filed, and about 1;1,000
patents liwued the omces being conducted
under the same laws and general organization
as were adopted at the original organlzaion.
when only from 100 to 500 applications were
made per annum. The Commissioner shows
that the office has outgrown the original plan
and that a few organizations have become
necisisarv. TtussabJect -.1 a I't.'sente-i to i on

embraced in the bill In relofore referred to.
The Commissioner complains of the want of

is impossible to transact the business of the
office properly without more nxim ln
which to arrange flies and drawings

v ear. Of this amount $2,313,400 was paid un
der the act of Congress of February 1., 1871, to
survivor of the war of 1812. Tbe annual in
crease of pensions bythe legislation of Con
gress, has more than kept pace with the natu

June 18 1872. has added, in amount, fc7 si,50u to

The ninth census is about completed. Its
completion Is a subject of congratulation, in
asmuch as the tie to be made of the statistics
therein conlain.si depends very greatly upon
the promptitude of the publication. The
Secretary of the Interior recommends that a
census he taken iu 175, which recommenda
tion should receive the ready attention orton
gress. The interval at present cstablied be
tween tlie Foderol census 1 so long
that the information obtained at the decima
period to the material condition, wants und
resources of the nation is of Utile practical
value, after the expiration of the first hair or
that period. It would probably obviate the
con-iitutional provision regarding decimal
causes of a census taken in 187.. Il should be
dl et.s! of all political character, and no re
apportionment of Congressional representa
lion should lie made under It. Such a census,
coni.ne, as It would, lu the last year of the
first centurv of our national existence, would
furnish a noble monument nf the progress or
the liiited states during that century
The rapidly increasing Interest In tue
mutter of education is a most encouraging
feature in the current history of the country,
and it is no doubt true that thl is due in a
great measure to the effort of the Bureau of
Kducat Ion. That office is continually receiv
ing evidences which abundantly prove its el
flclenrv, Irom the various iustittitions of
learning and education of all kinds through
out the countrv. The report of the ommis
sloner contains a vast amouul of educational
detail of great Interest. The bill now pend

priationof a part of the proceed of the sales

Importance to our real progress, and i so
unaulmouslv approved by the leading triends
of education', that we commend it to the fa
vorable attention of Congress.
Affairs ln the Territories are generally satlf
factorv. The energy and business capacity os
the ploueers who are settling up the vast do
main uot vet incorixir.-ited into Stales are
keeping pact- in Internal improvement and
civil government with the older ,-ommuuitie.
In but one of tli-m Utah-is the condition ol
atlairs unsatisfactory, except do tar as Un
quiet of the citizen may Is- disturbed by real
or Imagtnarv danger of Indian hostilities, it
has seemed to be the policy of the legislature
of Utah to evade all responsibility to the Gov -eminent
of tbe United states, and even to hold
a position in hostility to it. I recommend a
careful revision ol the- present laws of the
Territory v C-ingress, and the enactment of
such a law as t lie one proposed ln Congress at
Its last session for Instance or something simi
lar to it, as will secure peace and the equality
ol all citizens Iwfore the law, and the ulti
mate extinguishment of polygamy. Since the
establishment of a Territorial government tor
tlie District of Columbia, the improvement oi
the condition of the city of Washington and
surroundings, and the lncreosisi prosperity of
the citizens Is observable to the most
casual visitor. The nation being a large own
erof propcrtv In this city, should bear with
lhe citizens of the district its just share of the
exjH-nses of these improvements. I recom
mend therefore an appropriation to reim
burse tilt citizens ror the work done by them
along and la front of public grounds during
the post vear, and liberal appropriations in
order thai the Improvement and embellish
ments of the public buildings and grounds
may beep puce with the improvement raude
by the Territorial authorities.
The rejiort of the Commissioner of Agricul
ture gives a very full and interesting account
of the several divisions of that Department.
the horticultural, statistical, entomological,
and chemical, and the benefit conferred by
each upon the agricultural interests of lhe
country. The whole report Is a complete his
tory lu total for the working of tnat depart
ment ln all it branches, showing the manner
in which the farmer, merchant and miner is
informed, and the extent to which he is aided
in his pursuits, lhe Commissioner make one
recommendation that measures be taken by
Congress to protect and Induce the planting of
trees, and suggest that no part of the public
lands should lie disposed of without the con
dition that one-tenth of It be reserved ln tim
ber w here It exists, and where it does not ex
ist, inducements should Ik offered for plant
ing it.
ln accordance with the terms of the act of
roiigress, approved March :, 1871, providing
for the celebration of the one hundredth an
niversary of American Independence, a com
mission has lieen named, consisting of the two
members from each of the states and Terri
tories, i'he commission has held two sessions
and made satisfactory progress in organi
zation, and in the initiatory steps for carry
ing out the provisions of the act and lor exe
eulingthe provisions; also of the act of June
1, 187i,creatlngttCentennlal Board of Finance.
A preliminary report of the progress has been
received from the President of the Commis
sion, and is herewith transmitted. It will be
the duty of the Commissioner, at your
coming session to transmit a report of the
progress made, and lay before you the details
relating to t he exhibit ion of American and for
eign arts, product and manufactures, which,
by the terms Jof the act. Is to be held under
the auspices of the United States in the city
of Philadelphia, in the year 1878. This cele
bration will be looked forward to by Ameri
can citizens with great Interest, as marking
a century of greater iirogn-ss and prosperity
than is recorded tn the nlstory of any other
nation, aud proving a further gtssl purposc- in
bringing together ou our soil people of all the
commercial nations of the earth. In amanner

l l.S ABOUT COTTON.
Cotton owes its kingshipquite as much
to the tentioity with which its libres
adhere to one another, as to their length
or rl aeness ; and were it not that the fi tire
produced hy the bombai, or silk-cotton
tree, is too smooth, cotton would find
in it a powerful rival. Cottot-wood is
the downy bed in which the seed of the
cotton-plant are enveloped, and is the
product of hot countries. It has several
varieties, that cultivated in Algeria aud
in Southern Europe seldom attaining a
hight of over twelve inches, while at
the collator the plant grows as high as
an aDiile-tree, and bears a fruit twice
as ltvrire as that of the Algerian species.
The cotton grown In the East Indies is
of very inferior quality, its fibre being
short and hard; yet it was largely used
in manufacture, dunng tlie war in tne
United States. Chinese cotton is yellow.
and hence the peculiar color of the fabric
nailed nankeen.
The cut ton -ulaut is probably a native
of Africa, and Livingstone found it in
the interior of tliat couutry along the
banks of all the rivers, 'lhe ancient
EifVDtians doubtless imiwrted from
Ativssinia their cotton cloth for mummy-
wranoiUKs and for the garments of
priests aud nobles, and from them the
Jews uitierneo tne employment oi mai
texture for tlie robes of their priests: for
where the Bible makes mention of line
linen, we must read cotton, as flax does
not grow in hot climates. From Africa
cotton-culture passed into Persia and
Georgia; then into India, and from India
to China. In the latter empire all the
clothing of the poorer classes is of cot
ton, of extremely firm texture. Indeed,
so strong is the cotton cloth manufactur-

Considerable curiosity exists in New
York as to the authorship of the Beech-er-Tilton
libel. Mrs. Woodhull, her
sister aud "Colonel" Blood, each swore
before the Court that neither of them
wrote the article. It is now said that
the authorship has been traced to a most
unexpected source, and that positive
proof will be brought out as to the
writer of the libel in a few days.
