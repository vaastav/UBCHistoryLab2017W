SIX DAY RACE OVER.
WALTHOUR WINS FOR HIS TEAM IN
THi: FINAL SPRINT.
; ONLY A LENGTH BETWEEN FIRST AND
SECOND— RACERS FAR BEHIND THE
RECORD — ALBERT CHAMPION
THROWN FROM MOTOR
CYCLE AND HURT.
"Bobble" Walthcur and "Archie" McEachern
won the six day race last night at Madison
Square Garden. Walthour crossing the finish
line in a Tyhirlwind sprint a few minutes after
10 o'clock, about a length in front of Wilson,
the second man. who was about three lengths
in front of Maura. Babcock and Butler finished
only a few inches apart.
The finish mi witnessed by a vast crowd
that jammed every part of the Garden from
Ifloor to roof and swarmed over the space inside
j the track. The temperature of the air was
'furnace-like, and the air was so thick with to
bacco smoke and other and even less pleasant
flumes that it is doubtful if those in the high
est seats could see the numbers worn by the
irSders.
Only the five teams that trerc in the lead were
■ a-llcwed to compete in the last mile, which re
tolved itself into a sprint race, and was gov
erned by the rules of surh races. This barred
out Kir.? and Hamudson, and Hall and Mc-
Laren, and left only five teams to compete in
the final dash. It was arranged that a whistle
i-ehouia announce the beginning of the final mile.
, one pletcl shot the beginning- of the final lap,
t*nd two pist<M shots the end of the race. One
t>y MM th<i different riders -«.vho had been on the
; track were relieved, and just before the final
mile was begun the racers on their wheels were
Waithour. Wilson. Munro. Babcock and Butler.
They did not make much pace for the first
three or four laps, and WaKhcur and Butler
alternated In tbe lead. At the fourth lap But
ler took the lead and held It to the beginning of
the eighth lap where the real sprinting began.
Here Waithour ga\e a taste of his ability, and
ehot to the front iike an arrow. Wlison tacked
cnto his wheel and stayed there to the end. but
couid not cut down Walthour's short lead.
The crowd went wild with enthusiasm during
the finaJ sprint, and each move of the racers
was the sisnnl for a renewed outburst of cheer-
Ing. Walthour's line record as a middle distance
pace follow-r made him the general favorite for
the race, and he did not disappoint his friends.
!His wife was -at the side of the track, and after
he ar-d Wilson had ridden slowly around the
track t-Aice, side by side, she met her husband
a 6 he dismounted, and kissed him. to the bound
less delight of the throng. Several of the riders
had adrr.irers who sent them baskets of flowers,
and there were cheers and applause for each of
the teams as they left the track.
The prizes are divided as follows: Waithour
.-and McEachern. (L 980; Wilson and Maya.
,$1,000; Newkirk and Munro. 5750; Babcock and

the training evpenses of each of the teams that
remained to the finish.

'the race at the close Is given below. Although

The Southerners came near ending the race
for the first prize at 9 o'clock. Munro. who was
in the saddle for his team, started the sprint,
which -was the most terrific in the race up to
that time. Munro had gained almost half a
lap when relieved by Newkirk. and the team
bid fair to make the lap. when Waithour re
lieved McEachern. who was pacing the flying
.division in pursuit, and after "several rounds of
• the track caught up with the fleeing South
erners.
1 After the finish of the race the riders were
jdr*ssed and taken in carriages to a Turkish
•bath establishment in Twenty-eighth-st. The
.last mile was finished in 2:40. The last lap
.•was reeled off in the fast time of 14 seconds.
The record of six day team racing is 2,733 miles
'and 4 laps. The riders in this contest covered
only 2,555 miles and 4 laps, making them ITS
miles behind the record. Probably one hundred
thousand persons saw the racers in the course
»f the week.
The opening of the last day found the team"
. over two hundred miles behind the record. This
did not detract from the interest, however, as
«very man was evidently "plugging" at his best
'pace. There was a large number of women in
attendance all day. and they encouraged the
riders by their applause, and in many instances
by gifts of ruit and bouquets. King and Samuel-
Bon. the "Mormon team," came in for a gen
erous share of the favors. As the day advanced
the excitement became intense. So much sprint
ing ww done that the men had to relieve each
■Bar every few minutes, and the trainers were

ROWING.
PENNSYLVANIA CREW TO GO TO
HENLEY.
GRADUATES WILL BE CHOSEN. BECAUSE
UNDERGRADUATES ARE NOT
WELL. SEASONED.
[BT TELEGKArH TO THE TIUBCXE.]
Philadelphia. Dec. 14.-Pennsylvan!a will be rep
resented at Henley and in the great Irish regatta
that will be held at Dublin next year. Yesterday
an invitation was received from the Irish com
mittee, headed by Lord O'Brien, especially asking
the Pennsylvania crew to come over and take part
in it Invitations to this race have been sent out
to all the great colleges of America and to the
different rowing associations of the different coun
tries The idea of having; this regatta arose from
the visit of the Pennsylvania crew to Klllarney
la«=t year. The letter accompanying the invitation
is interesting, as showing the high opinion in which
Pennsylvania is held abroad. It reads as follows:
December 3, 1901.
Dear Mr. Reath and members of the University or
Pennsylvania crew and racing committee ot the
DeiT V |^P'l°do Pe nn n oo n tt S ia anythin g . could better
show you the amount of good the visu of t£e_Unl
verslty of Pennsylvania has done to the ro«»nb or
this country than the inclosure I have sent ami
lar invitations to the other chief unl T l"?' t _ !vho
America, but I need hardly say. no .matter who
comes over for the race, we in Ireland wouia leei
veS"onely r if the University of Pennsylvante. * not
represented. I am also writing to Australia Can
ada England and the Continent, and Ireland her
self will be strongly to the fore.
Lord O'Brien is very anxious to make this race a
success, and is using all his influence to do ' «>• te £
will feel much obliged If you will lav th is ma tter
before your committee, and I hope that .you
bring your Interest to boar upon It. >ou *" no * \ ce
that the date is arranged at a convenient time after
Henley. Faithfully y°™V^ LTER DOHERTY,
Chairman of the International Cup Committee of
Ireland.
The date of the race will be on July 21, 22 or 23.
Very liberal inducements have been offered to the
visting crews, and the race is sure to be a success.
Thomas Reath. chairman of Pennsylvania's row
ing committee, said that no action would be taken
on the matter until after Christmas, when the
regular meeting of the association would tak*
place. In his opinion Pennsylvania would not send
an undergraduate crew, but. if the necessary funds
were forthcoming, a graduate crew might be sent.
G. W. Allen, captain of the university crew,
echoed the sentiments of Mr. Reath. Coach Ward
was more communicative, He said:
I would be glad to have another try at Henley,
and there could bo nothing more pleasureaDle than
the anticipation of a trip to Ireland, where we were
treated in royal style last year. I shall advocate
the taking of a graduate crew, as our experience
last year proved that the best of our undergradu
ate crews 'are doomed to defeat because of the su
perior strength of the older and more experienced
English eights. We have in Philadelphia many of
m- oid oarsmen, and more than a dozen of them
are willing to come out and try for a seat in the
beat John Gardiner, the best stroke I have ever
had is on hand, and I am confident that a strong
crew can be got together. I am in favor of the
trip being taken, and I -hir.k that we shall have
a crew on the Thames next summer to make an
other try for Grand Challenge Cup and then go to
Ireland for Lord O'Brien's race.

KEWYOBE DAILY TBSWTSE. SUXDAY. DECEMBER 15. 1901.
SPALDING IX CONTROL.
PROMISES THOROUGH BASEBALL RE
ORGANIZATION.
FREEDMAN ATTACKS MAN WHO WILL
DRIVE HIM FROM THE LEAGUE
COMMITTEES APPOINTED.
When the magnates of the National League
adjourned their annual fall meeting at the Fifth
ivenu« Hotel yesterday no man could say
whether or not the once great organization of
baseball had an actual existence. It now re
maine for A. G. Spalding. the new president, to
bring together .he warring factions in base
ball. Whether he can do this time alone will
tell.
Supporting the new president and determined
to go on as the National League, are the owners
of the Pittsburg, Philadelphia, Brooklyn and
Chicago clubs. Arrayed on the other side, op
posing Mr. Spalding tooth and nail and favoring
a trust in baseball, are the proprietors of the
Boston, New-York, St. Louis and Cincinnati
franchises.
With Mr. Spalding in the chair the National
League held the last session of its five day
meeting at the Fifth Avenue Hotel yesterday.
Brush, Soden, Robison and Freedman were not
present. A quorum was declared after a clever
parliamentary ruling by the new president. Mr.
Freedman had sent his secretary. F. M.
Knowlea, to watch things. When the meeting
was called Mr. Knowles cautiously approached
the door and peered in. Quick as a flash Mr.
Knowles's name was called. As there were four
other clubs represented, Mr. Spalding ruled that
New-York should be counted as present, thereby
making a quorum. The members then proceeded
to business.
The first order of business was the election
of a new board of directors. The election re
sulted in the selection of Ebbets. of Brooklyn;
Soden, of Boston; Hart, of Chicago, and Drey
fu«s of Pittsburg. The following board of arbi
tration was then elected: Spalding. Young.
Soden, Hart Robers and Pulliam. President
Spalding appointed the following committees:
Constitution. Rogers. Hart and Brush; national
agreement, Hart. Brush and Rogers; playing
rules, Hart, Hanlon and Reach.
The league placed the question of a playing
schedule in the hands of President Spalding
with full power to act as he saw fit.
At the suggestion of Mr. Spalding the league
unanimously decided to invite all the reporters
to all future meetings of the organization. After
Mr. Spalding's platform had been presented and
approved by the magnates the meeting was ad
journed subject to the call of the chair, and
word was sent to the newspaper men to come to
the meeting room.
An attack on Mr. Spalding was made in a
statement given out at. the Democratic Club last
evening by Andrew Freedman. Parts of the
statement follow:
Mr. Spa.ding states as his reason for appearing
in the committee of the National League that be
believed Brush and his friends were form a
baseball trust. There can be no mistake about Mi
Spalding forming a basebal trust. I Kive you a
copy of an agreement Mr. Spaldmg: attempted .o
have signed by two or three clubs to form a nucleus
for ■ a fashioned after the bicycle 'rust. This
document is fashioned after forma of an agreement
by which he secured options from the bicycle
manufacturers, and Mr. Hart does rot deny thai
be attempted to secure the signatures of the clubs
for Mr. Spacing, assured the league presidents
visited that Mr. Spalding was a great schemer,
and would develop some sort of trust.
The agreement referred to contained the fol
lowing:
In consideration of the sum of $1. the receipt of
which is hereby acknowledged, we will eel to you
all of the capital stock, together with all of tne
property, of said company, except ••-" on nun.
and bills and accounts receivable, above referred
to at and for the price of dollars per share.
payable in cash upon delivery of said capital itoi X
•■■'"■ property. It being understood that the preseiu
business of said company win be kept us a going
concern and that no material changes will De
made in the capital stock, property, contracts or
conditions of said company without your knowledge
and consent.
The Freedman statement ended as follows:
No act or action of Mr. Bpalding*S private league
will be binding, and when the proper time comes
and when other clubs feel they care to participate,
action will be taken that will remove from
Mr Spalding's mind any question of th.» four
standing club 3. who were not considered eligible- to
vote in a proposition in which they were vitally
interested. And the amount of advertising Mr.
Spalding will get will be sufficient to satisfy him,
though not altogether pleasing. The New-York
club is not worrying over over Mr. Spalding's
threats. All will be attended to at the proper time
and proper plane.
It was said last night that a conference of the
Brush-Freedman forces would be held at Mr.
Freedman's place in Red Bank to-day.
The Spaldingr forces were apparently much
pleased with the way things had shaped them
selves. They are confident that they had the
better of the situation, and that the Brush-
Freedman crowd was on the run.
Mr. Spalding last . enlng announced that duly
accredited newspaper men were to be admitted
at future meetings of the National League, He
gave out a platform for raising the tone of the
game. In reply to the Freedrnan statement, Mr.
Spalding said:
As I have previously declared. Andrew Freedman
must get out of baseball. 1 am going to try all I
know huw to put him out. Either he <>r 1 must go.
Against his abomniable five-year record I'll match
one of thirty-five years, and let the public choose.
Last June I 'was told that in«» National League w ■
in a bad way. and that something had to r.e doi c,
•'Sted that some "f I'r^ Old tim<r:; be gol
out of base. all. A scheme was got UP wher-liy
cash options wire to be K"t on league clubs. The
scheme was to have each club owned and con
trolled by capital in the city which the club came
(r< :i..
Meetings were arranged between myself. Brush
anil Robison. A proposition was made to buy up
some of the American League clubs This I re
fused to <10. My motive in the whole proceeding
was to try to pet Freedman out of baseball. I be
lieve if I could get in option on the New-York
club at any reasonable figure I oouid find men who
would buy' I wanted to get Freerlman out by hon
orable means— buy him out. But th»- end of it all
came when those" men got together at Ked Bank
and abrogated the national agreement. Some time
I am going to get all these matters before the <H
rectors of the New-York ciub.
Mr. Spalding declared that he had refused to
invest 'a dollar In the proposed option scheme,
and had refused to tak-e a dollar out of it. He
added:
I was doinp it for the good of the dear old game.
I want to say right here that the new president
will not accept any salary in connection with the
job I am doing this to help along baseball. I
would like to know why Freedman soaked the
league $15,000 for the rent of Manhattan Field this
year Why were not the college games pla>ed at
Manhattan Field instead of the Polo Grounds?
"Will the Cincinnati club be included in the
schedule of games?" was asked.
"That I cannot answer. I really do not know.
Time alone will decide."
Urged for a statement as to what attitude the
Natipnal League would assume toward the
American League. Mr. Spalding said:
That matter cannot be decided offhand. It wUI
receive immediate attention. I favor one great
baseball family— an .jr^-anization that will take in
the National, American and minor leagues— and,
yes, the player?. Let the players be on a footing
of equality. We need them and they need us.
There was given out yesterday some corre
spondence which passed between A. G. Spalding
and J. T. Brush last June. It followed a talk
w hich the two men had about the possibie deser
tion of the Baltimore and Detroit clubs of the
American League to the National League in the
middle of the season. Mr. Spalding wrote to
Mr. Brush on June 20 that he thought such de
sertions from the American League would
"prove a boomerang to the National League
and forever belittle and disgrace the two clubs."
Many of those who are intimately conversant
with baseball politics are of the opinion that
the action of the Boston. New-York, St. Louis
and Cincinnati magnates, in bolting at Friday
night's meeting, was an acknowledgment of de
f»at. The parliamentary point decided by Colo
nel Rogers, of Philadelphia, is founded on
recognized prec?d.-nt. In a famous decision in
Corgress Speaker Reed ruled that members ab
f-ent from a meeting room who had not been
excused must be considered as present and not
voting.
The position of N. E. Young was a decided
surprise. That he was willing to let his name
be used in the voting by the Freedman-Brush
Combination is inexplicable For the las ft
years they are the men wlio have systematical^
attacked Young and demanded his removal as
president of the league.
FREEDMAN? HE CANT COME IN"
BAN JOHNSON SAYS HE WONT BE PER
MITTED TO HAVE ANT CONNECTION
WITH AMERICAN LEAGUE.
St. Louis, Dec. 14.— Ban Johnson, president of
the American League, was in St. Louis to-day on
his way to Chicago, from a hunting trip in the
Southwest. His attention was called to the possi
bility of Andrew Freedman. of the New-York Na
tional League Club, being taken up by the Ameri
can League. Mr. Johnson said that under no cir
cumstances would Mr. Freedman be permitted to
have any connection with the American League
He made this statement before he was aware or
the election of A. G. Spauldlng to the presidency
of the National League.
TALE WILL MEET LEAGUE TEAMS.
HAS NOT PLAYED WITH PROFESSIONALS IN
SOME YEARS-COLLEGE DOES NOT
FEAR THREATS.
New-Haven, Dec. 14.— The Yale baseball team will
play with several of the National League teams
in the Easter trip if Manager Hugh Satterlee is
able to make arrangements. Mr. Satterlee said to
night that Yaie refuses utterly to take part in
professional league disputes, and that lale would
play whom she chose, in spit*> of threats, lale
will probably play Boston in tbe Southern trip.
It is also probable that Yale and the New-Haven
ba«eba!l team will meet in a series of games, as
the demand of the New-Haven baseball public has
been increasing every year for such a series, lale
has not met a professional team for some years.
YALE'S BASEBALL SCHEDULE.
New-Haven, Dec. 14 (Special).— The schedule for
the baseball season for next spring as announced
by the Yale officials does not include games with

NOTES OF THE GAMB.
To Judge from the entries received «o the
second mternatkmal tournament of the Club dcs
Strangers at Monte Carlo promises to be even
m^re successful than the first, held at the begin
ning of this year. German papers announce that
Lasker. Plllsbury. Janowskl. Tschigorin. Yon

Mason. Reggio. Billecard. Mieses. Albin. Tauben
haus and Walbrodt have already sent their ap
plications for a place, while it is known that Mar
shall ar.d Napier, of this city, have also tor« ;*rd*d
their applications. No doubt Schlech.er and
Marocsy Will meanwhile have forwarded their en
tri. b, in which case there will be a field of «a«l>
twenty players. Looking over the list. It will be
that' the best available experts, wuh w>
few exceptions, will battle over the checkered
boards at Monte •
The challenge for the annual cable chess match
between the British Chess Club. London, and the
Brooklyn Chess Club was duly received by the lat
ter and promptly accepted. Unfortunately, how
ever the secretary of the Brooklyn club has so far
been unable to offer any dates for this contest.
Owing to the Monte Carlo tournament in which
some of the American and British experts will be
engaged it stands to reason to suppose that the
cable match could not well take place before the
end of March.
SCHAEFFER MAY GO TO WfOLASB.
HIS TRAINER. KISTLER. WILL ATTEMPT TO
SWIM ACROSS THE ENGLISH CHANNEL.
[by TF.ir.iinrn TO THE TRIBtNE.]
Philadelphia. Dec. 11.-Schaeffer, America's cham
pion swimmer, will probably be sent to England
next summer. His recent series of victories have
shown the National Swimming Association of
Philadelphia that for the first time America has
a man worthy to measure strokes with the best
of the British cracks. In the recent championships
Schaeffer made a complete list of new records from
120 yards up to 500 yards. He won all his races
with ease, and In several instances he could have
broken the records made by the Englishmen had
he been at all pushed. He is a swimming marvel,
and if he goes to England. Derbyshire. Lane and
Jarvls will have to improve on their present world's
records to ward oft' defeat.
Schaeffer will be accompanied by his trainer.
Professor Kisilcr. He will not only see after the
training of America's champion but he will essay
a feat that has yet to be aon?. though Captain
Webb is generally accredited with the feat, name
ly the Swimming of the English Channel. Kistler s
great swim in the Delaware last September, when
he covered thirty-five miles without getting out of
the water, show* that he has good chances of doing
the trick To give America's swimming the place
it now deserves in the world of swimming it is
hoped that these two men. the greatest amateur
and professional swimmers in America, will make
the journey. •
