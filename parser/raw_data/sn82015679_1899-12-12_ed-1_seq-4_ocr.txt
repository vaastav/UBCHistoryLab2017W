The .fight between the Populists and the
Democrats in Nebraska for the appoint
ment to the Senate Is liable to test the
strength of the Bryan fusion.
The Louisville Courier-Journal calls upon
every newspaper, every legislator and ev
ery teacher and head of & family In Ken
tucky to denounce the Maysvllle horror.
The appeal will be timely In other States.
It Is announced that all the leading gov
ernments In Europe will agree with the re-'
quest of the United States to furnish a
written guarantee to maintain the "open
door" In China, which Is better for us than
any alliance.
Senator Lindsay, of Kentucky, asks the
country. In the Independent, not to take a
pessimistic view of his State because of the""
recent political contest. The senator Is a
loyal son, but his State does not do itself
credit when It drops him from the Senate
for Joe Blackburn.
"When everybody else seemed to know
that Mr. Taylor, the Republican candidate,
would be declared elected Governor of Ken
tucky, Mr. Bryan on Saturday telegraphed
his congratulations to Goebel over his elec
tion. It Is the frequent, not to say con
tinual, misfortune of Mr. Bryan to misun
derstand matters.
Mr. Smith, of Kentucky, has offered a bill
In the House appropriating $50,000 for the
Improvement of Salt river. The appropria
tion cannot be made available before the
election next November; besides, Mr.
Bryan's party has so recently navigated
that river that it should be able to ascend
It next year without peril.
Representative Robinson, of the Fort
Wayne district. Is of opinion that the gen
erally improved times will promote the
election of Mr. Bryan. The better times
followed the election of McKinley and the
adoption of his policy; this being the case,
the average man will fail to see by what
process of reasoning those who recognize
that fact will, as a natural consequence,
vote for Mr. Bryan.
The so-called 'industrials' on the stock
market took a tumble yesterday. Even the
stock of the tin-plate trust, about the firm
values of which there was some boasting
a few days ago, dropped materially. AH
of these stocks are of more or less specu
lative value, and their fall simply indicates
that those traders who manipulate the
market have concluded that the time has
come to squeeze the amateurs.
It is asserted as certain that eleven Dem
ocratic members of the House will vote for
the Overstreet currency bill and that it is
possible that eleven more will do so be
cause they represent districts whose busi
ness men believe in the gold standard.. The
Republicans are not anxious for their as
sistance, but it is for the interest of the
Democrats to hold all their men if possible,
since if a considerable number vote for the
Mil the majority fear that it will have a
serious influence on the party.
Councilman- Morlarlty. of the Tenth
ward, who Is trying to wear the man
tle of the lamented Sim Coy, Is the keeper
of a doggery to at knows no closing hour.
Teople who live in the vicinity say It Is
open all night. The tragedy of Sunday
morning that resulted In the death of
Dr. Ward's son might not have occurred
had Morlarlty and other saloon-keepers of
his kind obeyed the law and closed at 11
o'clock. Ward Is said to have been in Mo
larity's place at 4 o'clock in the morning,
anortly before the fatal quarrel. If this be
CJtie the authorities will have ample proof
that Councilman Morlarlty is a law-breaker
and morally responsible for complicity
In the death of Ward. If guilty he should
be punished, even at the risk of offending
the Democratic rounders who placed him
In the Council.
The speech of Mr. Overstreet In the
House yesterday is given to the readers
of the Journal this morning in full. It is
the very general opinion of the friends of
the. measure in Washington that no man
in the House could have been selected who
could better present the arguments in fa
vor of the financial bill than Mr. Over
street. It contains no Sights of oratory
and no passages taat will make a school
boy's declamation, but it contains all the
arguments, the facts and the logic which
make an unassailable case for the gold
standard. Mr. Overstreet's speech, aside
from the subject, is a model of clear and
concise method of statement, far above
the devices of the demagogue. The speech
gives Mr. Overstreet a national reputation,
and at the beginning of his third term
wins him a place anions the leaders of the
Xlouse.
An exchange which works Itself Into a
state of indignation because the heads of
the three higher institutions of learning in
th Ctate are members of the Board of Ed
ucation seems ignorant of the fact that the
Izzt Leslilaiure added three members to
C23 fccird who are supposed to represent
the colleges and universities which have no
aid from the State. Such Is the fact, so
that the old ground for accusation against
the Board of Education no longer exists.
The board Is probab.y strengthened by the
additions made by the last Legislature, be
cause It gives the experience of a larger
number of men who have devoted their at
tention to teaching. In the past the criti
cism has been directed not against the
qualifications of the? presidents of the so
called state Institutions for the work of tne
board, because their fitness Is generally
recognized, but because they are connected
with the State schools. With the other in
stitutions represented the criticism no
longer has a pretext.
STILL PLAYING POLITICS.
If Mayor Taggart were sincere in what
he proposes the Journal would regard with
much solicitude "Is proposition to consider
the purchase of the property of the Con
sumers Gas Trust, with a view of putting
down sufficient mains to the receding gas
region. As he is not sincere, his talk about
the purchase Is regarded as one of his po
litical bluffs designed to place the majority
of the Council In a false light. This propo
sition Is too wild, however, to deceive
the ignorant people who regard him
as a wonder. Mr. Taggart has no Idea of
purchasing the property referred to not
the least. When it comes to the pinch he
will not put himself on record In favor of
purchase unless he Is certain that the
Council will reject It.
If the shareholders and managers of the
Consumers' Trust had good reason to be
lieve that it would be a good investment
to put down another main line to the gas
sixty miles away and to put in new pump
ing machines, - they would do it. They do
not do it because they are satisfied that
the gas supply is fast falling, and that the
money expended upon new lines and pumps
would be thrown away. Is there any rea
son to believe that Mayor Taggart is not
of the same opinion? Are there facts or
statistics that warrant any other conclu
sion? If there are, the wide-awake men of
the Consumers' Trust have them not. As a
matter of fact, those who are best in
formed admit that there will be no gas in
a few years. Mr. Leach, the most sanguine
of the gas people, win not give an opinion
as to tht possibility of a supply that will
warrant tne outlay.
It would be a godsend for the Consum
ers Trust to dispose of its property for any
considerable portion of the money it rep
resents. It would be a calamity for the
city to purchase at any price and put sev
eral hundred thousand dollars Into new
main lines and pumping stations. It would
be a blunder, because it would take a vast
amount of money, all of which would be
represented by miles of rusty pipes and
acres of abandoned pumping machinery in
four or five years. Under the present valua
tion of the city for taxation (J123.573.201) the
limit of city indebtedness is $2,471,464. May
or Taggart has already increased the city
debt to $2,017,400, leaving $450,000 in round
numbers, which he can, if the Council wills,
devote to the purchase of vanishing gas,
properties. But Mr. Taggart has no such
intention, because he is neither a gullible
person nor an enthusiast. In the business
office of mayor, to which a man should
bring Intelligence and candor, Mr. Taggart
is engaged in playing politics, and peanut
politics at that.
The report of the director of the mints
presents some facts that will serve to dis
pel the doubts expressed by those papers
which are half predicting a panic because
there is not enough money in the world to
meet the urgent and extraordinary de
mands upon the stock of gold. The war in
South Africa Is a source of satisfaction to
those who, for political reasons, would
like to have something happen that would
Interrupt the prosperity based upon the
gold standard and the rapidly increasing
stock of gold. With Ill-concealed satisfac
tion, one of this class of public men de
clared, not long since, that the war in the
Transvaal would reduce the current out
put of gold one-half as long as it continues.
If the war prevents the working of the
mines in South Africa It will reduce the
output one-fourth of what it would other
Wise be, but it is not probable that the war
will be a long one, and even if It is the
output has increased so rapidly in other
parts of the world that, leaving South
Africa out of the account, the total for
next year will exceed that of 1S96. The
yield of the world during the calendar
year 1S3S was $2S7,000,000; in 1S37 it was $2C3,
000.000, and in 1S03, $200.2S3,000. Such figures
prove that no danger lies in the insuffi
ciency of gold for the world's legal tender
money.

One peculiar fact In connection with the
admission of Indiana to the Union Is that
her representative In Congress, one Wil
liam Hendricks, and her two senators also,
had taken their seats nine days before the
State they were to represent had become a
State at all. These gentlemen took their
seats on Dec. 2 at the beginning of the
session, and the State was not admitted
until nine days later, Dec. 11, by the
signature of the President. So deilnitely
settled was it that the territory would be
admitted to statehood at that session that
it was not considered necessary to delay
the seating of the legally chosen represent
atives by reason of the technicality in
volved. Likewise, when Missouri was ad
mitted, four years later, she had cast her
vote for President Monroe and that vote
had been counted before the admission of
the State. When the Vice President an
nounced the electoral vote he said: "There
are 221 votes, counting those of Missouri,
and 21S without them." That was the meth
od of conducting business under Demo
cratic administrations in the early days.
It would hardly obtain in these days of
adhesion to the letter of the law. In
diana has continued about nine days ahead
of the procession ever since her admission.

Indiana's Representation In the He
publlcan National Convention Un
der the Proposed Change.
Special to the Indianapolis Journal.
WASHINGTON. Dec. 11. Strenuous ef
forts are still making to remove Colonel
Bright from his position as sergeant-at-arms
of the Senate, with Increasing pros
pects of success. Senator Allison Is con
tinually on the move and Is doing great
missionary work among his Republican as
sociates who want to keep Bright In, or
who have a prejudice against Alonzo Stew
art, the young man who quietly secured the
pledges of Republican senators before any
body knew a contest against Bright was
contemplated. The discovery has been
made that Republicans are not holding out
against reorganizing Bright out of his
place so much as they are objecting to the
Stewart programme, in the hope that they
may induce his withdrawal and thus throw
the contest open for candidates of their
own. Objection to Stewart seems to be
softening somewhat, due to the campaign
which his patron. Senator Allison, is car
rying on, and it now looks very much as
though Stewart would win when the sen
ators ready to go in caucus.
Senator Fairbanks introduced two bills
to-day of interest to Indiana. One is to re
imburse Thomas Ryan, of Indianapolis, in
the sum of $."..500 for damages sustained in
the purchase of certain high wines years
ago, involving a revenue tax question. The
other authorized the secretary of the navy
to furnish Culver Academy, In Marshall
county, with one or more drill boats of the
kind in use at Annapolis.
Senator Fairbanks has presented to the
Senate a number of petitions from citizens
of Indiana making polygamy a crime.
These petitions are from William Barclay
and thirty-six others, of Harmony; Alonzo
B. Clark and twelve other Indianapolis peo
ple; A. Wilson and twenty-one others, of
Indianapolis; Rev. J. S. Riley and thirty
two others, of Cynthiana; J. S. Barnes and
sixty-two others, of Hebron; H. J. McKin
nel and nineteen others, of Marshfield; C.
F. Thomas and 114 others, of Floyd coun
ty; C. H. Newton and six others, of Fort
Wayne; William Pearcc and nine others, of
Goshen; Mrs. Thomas H. Drake and forty
nine others, of Oakland City; Dr. D. Keith
and nineteen others, of Hagerstown, and S.
N.' Congili and 113 others, of Floyd county.
Representative Zenor to-day introduced a
bill authorizing the secretary of war to
purchase or acquire by condemnation a
tract of land of not less than 200 acres, sit
uated within three miles of the Falls of the
Ohio, and contiguous to the cities of New
Albany, Jeffersonville and Louisville, Ky.,
and establish thereon a military post. The
price to be paid for the land is limited to
$0.0,000. The bill, however, carries a total
appropriation of $150,000.

The old fight has been renewed for a
change in the basis of representation In
the Republican national convention. The
end sought is to reduce the representation
from States hopelessly against the party
holding the convention. The method now
prevailing is to allow two delegates for
each representative in Congress and two
delegates for each United States senator.
The two plans for reconstruction of the
existing system will be brought before the
national committee in Washington on
Wednesday of this week. One of them will
be proposed by Mr. Payne, member of the
national committee of Wisconsin, and the
other by Mr. Achcson, representative from
Pennsylvania. Mr. Payne's plan proposes
four delegates-at-large from each State,
one additional delegate forach 10.000 Re
publican votes cast at the preceding presi
dential election and one for a fraction more
than 5,000 additional. This Is objected to on
the ground that it sets a.-ide the Republic
an principle of representation in national
conventions by congressional districts, a
principle which, being along the lines of
local self-government, enlists powerful sup
port. Mr. Acheson's plan provides for four
delcgates-at-large from each State, one for
each 10.000 votes cast at the preceding pres
idential election and one for each fraction
more than 5,000, and provides further that
each congressional district shall have at
least one delegate. The "cracker" to the
latter plan meets, in a measure, the ob
jection raised against Mr. Payne's sugges
tions. Under the Acheson plan the total number
of delegates, exclusive of the Territories,
according to the presidential election of
1S95. would be P12. Under the plan which Is
now In force the number, exclusive of Ter
ritories, would be SD2. The Acheson" plan
would make a revolutionary readjustment,
but a net Increase of only twenty. The
Illinois representation would be raised from
4$ to CI, a gain of 13: Indiana would be In
creased from 30 to 36. a gain of 6; Iowa
ou!d be raised from 2 to 32. a gain of 6;
Wisconsin from 24 to 32. a gain of 8, and
Michigan from 23 to 33. a gain of 6. Ala
bama would lose 9. Arkansas 6. Florida 2,
Georgia 11. Kentucky 1. Louisiana 6. Mis
sissippi 7, North Carolina 5, South Carolina
7, Tennessee o, Texas 11 and Virginia 5.
The Indiana representation under the
Acheson plan would be a follows: At
large, 4: First district. 2: Second. 2: Third.
2: Fourth. 2: Fifth. 3: Sith. 2; Seventh. 3;
Eighth. 3; N'nth. 2; Tenth. 3; Eleventh. 3;
Twelfth. 2: Thirteenth. 3; total.. SC. Under
the plan suggested by either gentleman
mentioned the States which elect would
also have the naming of the presidential
candidate.

GENERAL NEWS
Renewal of Opposition to General
Wheeler Taking Ills Seat.
WASHINGTON, Dec. ll.-The opposition
to General Wheeler's taking his seat as a
member of the House of Representatives
from Alabama is to be renewed by Repre
senative Bailey,1 of Texas, whose resolu
tions last year brought out a representa
tion from the House Judiciary committee
that a military and a congressional office
could not be held at the same time. Gen
eral Wheeler Is now in the Philippines, but
it has been understood that he would re
turn to take his seat. The sergeant-at-arms
has over $2,000 to the credit of the
Alabama member, covering salary from
March 4 last to date, but General Wheeler
has not asked for the amount and he ex
pressed an unwilllngnes to sign the certifi
cate usually required of members in the
settlement of their accounts. Considerable
sums are also held for Messrs. Campbell,
Colson, Bobbins and General Wheeler, who
served in the last Congress and also in the
army, and, as the accounts of the old Con
gress are being closed, these latter sums
were last week turned back into the treas
ury. It is practically decided that the holiday
recess of Congress will be from Thursday,
Dec. 21. to Wednesday, Jan. 3. Thus far,
however, there has been no formal action.
The commissioner of internal revenue has
rendered a decision In which he holds that
persons calling themselves agents of brew
ers in selling original stamped packages of
beer must show that the beer remains ab
solutely the property of the brewers, in
their hands, until t?old by them for and on
account of the brewers, and not on their
own account. Otherwise collectors are to
report them to the commissioner for as
sessment of special taxes and penalty as
wholesale dealers in malt liquors.
The Roberts Investigating committee was
not in session to-day, having adjourned un
til to-morrow, when Mr. Roberts will be
heard further. A member of the committee
stated there was little further doubt that
a subcommittee, and possibly the full com
mlttee would have to visit Utah and take
testimony. Roberts's witnesses will be sum
moned along with the others and will be
given tne same allowances for traveling
expenses, etc., as the other witnesses re
ceive. The Governor of New Mexico, in his an
nual report, estimates the population of
the Territory at 2fi0,5G0, and says this year's
record will exceed nimost all former vcars
in the revenue 'derived from produce,

plea for statehood.
Secretary nay has cabled to United
States Consul Stanley Hollis at Lourenzo,

the first day's session of the annual con
vention of the American Federation of La
bor. The situation in Detroit, where the
stage employes have been locKed out for
some months, with their union unrecog
nized by the managers, is the primary
cause of the disturbance. It developed
during this afternoon's proceedings that
the action of the Detroit Central Labor
Union in expelling the Detroit theater
musicians, after they had declined to strike
and join with the stage employes, is strong
ly upheld by the stage hands' alliance, and
as heartily condemned by the Musicians'
National Union. A special committee will
endeavor to bring about harmony.
Nearly 200 -delegates, representing all
branches of trade unionism, with an esti
mated total membership of nearly 800,000,
were seated In Harmonic Hall when the
nineteenth annual convention of the fed
eration was called to order. In the absence
of both President Gompers and Vice Pres
ident Maguire, the gathering was called to
order by James Duncan, of Baltimore, sec
ond vice president. Mr. Duncan announced
that Mr. Gompers was still suffering se
verely from injuries resulting recently from
a bicycle accident in Washington, and pos
sibly might not be able to attend the con
vention. After adoption of a resolution of sympa
thy for Mr. Gompers, his annual report
was read by Vice President Duncan. The
report congratulates the Federation on tho
progress made during the year, and urges
that the ground gained be made a vantage
point from which to render an increased
activity still more profitable to the order.
It refers to the industrial revival of the
times and refers to the part organized la
bor bears In bringing it about and Its share
in the result. Additional affiliations during
the year have brought the Federation fig
ure up to seventy-three national and inter
national unions, eleven state federations, IIS
city centrals and assemblies, 593 locals and
202 federal labor unions. All glassworkers,
except window glass blowers, are affiliated.
Regret is expresred that responses are so
meager to the call for participation in a
Federation exhibit at the Paris exposition.
The increased use of the union label is
noted and work to the end of a further
Increase is urged. The right to use the
boycott is Insisted on, and a more general
contribution to the defense fund is urged.
The federal government, the Idaho State
government and the federal courts are de
nounced on account of the Idaho mining
troubles, and "militarism" Is unsparingly
made anathema. A shorter work day is
declared to be a necessity and efforts to
secure the Introduction of the eight-hour
law is urged. Child labor is denounced and
the seamen's rights bill, now a law, is
commended. "Pinkertonism" comes In for
a scoring, and "expansion" Is treated in a
paragraph which takes general grounds
against it. The prevention of pending
strikes at Havana Is classed as "an out
rage," and it is said "the principle of self
government is being denied the Filipinos."
International peace Is declared to be the
mission of organized labor.
The reports of Frank Morrison, secretary,
and John B. Lennon, treasurer, were also
read.
Delegate James O'Connell, president of
the Machinists' Association, one of the
fraternal delegates to the British trades
union convention, gave a sketch of that
convention.

THE HON. "BILLY MASON DELIV
ERS A SPEECH IN THE SENATE.
He Asks that Sympathy Be Extended

tally Twists the Lion's Tall.
RIDICULES MR. CHAMBERLAIN
AS A LILIPUTIAN RATTLING AROUND
IN GLADSTONE'S SHOES.
Resolution of the Illinois Statesman
Goes to the Committee on For
dsn Relations for Burial.
WASHINGTON. Dec. 11. An appeal by
Mr. Mason, of Illinois, for an expression
of sympathy for the Transvaal Republic in
its war with Great Britain was tho feature
of tho Senate proceedings to-day. It was
the first formal address delivered In the
Senate this season, and was listened to
with thoughtful attention by both tho
members and by a large gallery of audit
ors. The resolution on which Mr. Mason
based his speech was referred, at the con
clusion of his address, to the foreign re
lations committee, Mr. Lodge considering
it too delicate a question in view of the
position of this government to pass upon
without serious consideration, rso business
of importance was transacted by the Sen
ate and an early adjournment was taken.
While Mr. Mason's address at times was
vehement almost passionate he confined
himself during a greater part of the time
closely to his manuscript, spraking at all
times with force and vigor. In opening.
he said: "The war between monarchy and
republicanism began in earnest, July 4,
1776, and no treaty of peace has ever been
concluded, nor ever will be, until the ques
tion is settled right. The monarchical trust
company, though often quarreling among
themselves, have always agreed on one
thing, that a republic is a mistake."
After quoting extensively from Daniel
Webster's speeches in support of his po
sition, Mr. Mason continued: "But we are
told that England was our friend In the
war with Spain. How? Her people were
our friends because her people are a Chris
tian people; her government has never be
fore been our friend except for purposes
of its own. I have no desire to twist the
lion's tall, but truth compels the statement,
so far as our interests are concerned, for
the last half century the government of
England and the people of Englanad have
been divided. You remember lStl? The
government did-ail It could to divide the
Union, but the brave, starving weavers re
fused to resolve against us, saying they
would starve before they would say a word
for slavery. But even suppose she were to
day our best friend, are we to be silent and
uphold wrong in consideration of that
friendship? We Republicans are charged
with a secret alliance with England. It can
not be true, and the vote which this or a
similar resolution receives will answer the
C MrMason maintained that, under the
Monroe doctrine and on precedents previ
ously well established, the United States
had the same right to extend its sympathy
and hopes for success to the Boers in their
struggle for liberty as it had to Interfere
with Spain in its conduct of affairs in
Cuba. He urged that the interest of this
country was aroused by the fact that the
South African war was a struggle between
democracy and royalty-between the divine
right of kings and the divine right of man
"If we should speak," he declared, ' and
speak quickly, it would sting the politicians
who brought on the war for greed of gold
and cheer the poor, brave Dutch defender
of his home."
JOHN. BULL A BROWBEATER,
Mr. Mason contended that the question
Involved in the controversy between Great
Britain and the Transvaal prior to hostili
ties, was simply one of supremacy In
South Africa, "and I ask," said he, "in
common Justice, what right has Great Brit
ain to be supreme in South Africa?" It is
a fight to control South Africa, and the
only way England could do it was to
threaten, bulldoze, browbeat and interfere
with the Dutchman until, out of sheer
humiliation and desperation, he was driven
to fight."
Referring to Mr. Chamberlain, Mr. Ma
son said: "Let the distinguished lilliputian
statesman, rattling around In Gladstone's
shoes, trying to undo his work and break
his promises, be assured that he is deceiv
ing no one except, possibly, himself."
He declared that no nation, except a pro
fessed bully, would make the demands
upon another that Great Britain made
upon the Transvaal Republic and, in clos
ing, said: "1 have not sought to excite
prejudice by our past differences with Eng
land. They are forgotten and forgiven. But
when the colors of a republic are struck
and we sit silent, itjwould seem that we
are ashamed or tired of our institutions
and by our silence give consent to the de
struction of self-government 'n Africa.
The statue of liberty enlightening the
world in New York harbor is neither a
myth, fiction nor a He. We may tay, with
out boasting, that If self-government Is
right, we have helped the world. If
I am right this resolution will help. It will
say to the world, 'Washington, Monroe and
Webster are dead, but the American policy
still lives It may sting the oppressor, but
it will be a message of affection and hope
to the struggling republic." Mr. Mason ad
dressed the Senate for an hour and twenty
five minutes. He was not once Interrupted
in the course of his speech.
At its conclusion, Mr. Lodge, after ex
pressing the wish that Mr. Mason might
have delivered his address in the British
Parliament, said there was a wide gulf
between private opinion and public official
expression. The legislative department of
the government, he said, had assumed a
neutral attitude towards the South African
war. The passage of this resolution by
the Senate would change immediately the
attitude. "If we are to depart from the
position of neutrality," said Mr. Lodge,
"it ought to be a subject of most serious
consideration." He moved, therefore, that
the resolution be referred to the commit
tee on foreign relations and it was so or
dered. Mr. Cockrell directed the attention of
the pension committee to a bill introduced
by request by Mr. Pottus, of Alabama,
providing for the payment of a pension to
freedmen.
Mr. Galllnger, chairman of the committee
on pensions, expressed the opinion that no
such measure should have been presented
to Congress.
"In my Judgment," said Mr. Galllnger,
"this is a bill that ought not to, and prob
ably will not receive the favorable con
sideration of the pension committee. The
promoters of the bill are deluding thou
sands of people and are simply trying to
keep this agitation alive for their own
benefit." v
Mr. Cockrell urged that the bill be re
ported back adversely as noon as possible.
It was referred to the pension committee.
Mr. Pettigrew offered a resolution call
ing upon the secretary of war for all re
ports and orders relating to Gen. H. C.
Merrlam's action towards the Couer
d'Alene miners, reciting certain charges
against Gen. Merrtam in his "conduct of the
affair. Mr. Chandler objected to the Im
mediate consideration of the resolution
and it went over.

side
M'CLELLAN S PROTEST.
Mr. McCIeilan opposed the bill. "I do
:iot wish it understood." said he, "that I
Advocate the present system of bank-note
currency." The first direct consequence of
the enactment of this bill, he said, will be '
a very great raise in the market price of
government bonds. Its enactment also
would result In the extinction of the pres
ent bank-note currency. He argued that
the Impounding of the treasury notes and
the United States notes in the terms of
the bill would result in a contraction of
the currency, amounting to over $2G5,0'X.000
and require an issue of bonds to that
amount at an annual cost of JWO.OOO, or a
total contraction of the currency of nearly
$3i0.0u0,000 and a reduction of the per capita
to $19.21. In conclusion, he appealed to the
sound money Democrats in the House not
to vote for the bill. "Sound money Demo
crats," said he, "this bill does not aid the
cause of sound money. I beg you. 1 Implore
you, before you resolve to cast j your votes
for it bring to its consideration all the
patriotism that is in you. Ask yourselves
if the passage of the bill will not forever
prevent a proper and Just reform of the
currency; ask yourselves if this bill is not
the severest blow that has ever been aimed
at a sound financial system, and If, as I
believe you will, you decide that this Is a
bad bill and that its passage will not be
for the best interests of the country, then
stand up. side by side, with the party you
all love and to v;hich you all belong ar.d
help to cast an undivded and united Demo
cratic vote against one of the worst pieces
of legislation ever submitted to 4.e United
States Congress." Democratic applause.
Mr. De Armond lollowed in opposition to
the bill. Replying to Mr. Dolllver, he said
the Democrats had- not been overborne in
lSf)6 in the conflict of reason, but the Re
publican party had won by summoning to
their aid the corrupt and tremendous power
of money and corporations. He charged the
Republicans with deceiving tne people in
IS.. They were blmetallists then. If they
were honest then .uey must be dishonest
now; if honest now, dishonest then. The
change of the bonds from coin to gold
bonds, he said, would make a free gift of
$100,000,000 to the bonaholders. The bill
would create a bank trust. He predicted
that this measure would overwhelmingly
defeat the Republican party In 1900. When
the people's victory was won next fall, said
he, in conclusion, it must not be necessary
to go to the vine-clad cottage" at Can
ton, O., to offer congratulations, but be
yond the Mississippi, to that modest home
in Lincoln, Neb., where resided that great
and stanch friend of the people. Demo
cratic applause.
Mr. Greene then announced the death of
his colleague, the late Representative
Ermentrout, of Pennsylvania, and, at 5:05,
as a further mark of respect, the fiouse
adjourned.
AN UNLAWFUL SEIZURE
THE SUPREME COURT DECIDES IS
FAVOR OF SPANIARDS.
Says the Steamer Buena Ventura Was
Not Lesrally n Naval. Prlr.e Rul
ing In Other Cases.
WASHINGTON, Dec. U.-The United
States Supreme Court to-day decided in
the naval prize money case, growing out
of the capture of the Spanish steamer
Buena Ventura during the Spanish war,
that the condemnation of the vessel was
contrary to the terms of the President's,
proclamation and ordered the proceeds of
the sale of the vessel to be' turned over to
the owners. In the cases of the vessels
Pedro and Guldo, also owned by Spaniards,
the condemnation was affirmed.
The opinion In the case of the Buena
Ventura was handed down by Justice
Peckham, and turned on the construction
of the clause of tne President's message
of the 26th of April, 1S9S. exempting Span
ish vessels In American ports from the
operation of the proclamation of war un
til tho 21st of May following, the point
being whether the President's exemption
order applied to Spanish vessels which had
left American ports for ports in a neutral
country prior to tho issuance of the proc
lamation. Justice Peckham's opinion held
that it did apply to vessels under this con
dition, and that on this account the Ven
tura, though owned by a Spanish house,
was exempt. He said in this connection
that the policy of the United States had
always been one of liberality in such cases,
and that there was no reason for a change
of policy at this time. He. therefore, held
that the owners were entitled to the pro
ceeds of the sale of the vessel. Justices
Gray and McKenna dissented.
The chief justice delivered the opinion of
the court in the cases of the Pedro and
Guldo, and while the condemnation of these
vessels was affirmed, there were dissents
in both cases. Four of the nine members
of the court united In a dissenting opinion
in the Pedro case. This dissenting opinion
was handed down by Justice White and
was concurred in by Justices. Brewer, Shi
ras and Peckham. The chief Justice In his
opinion In this case states the facts to be
that the Pedro had left Liverpool in March
with a cargo for Cuban ports, with the in
tention of axterwards proceeding to the
United States for a cargo of lumber for her
return voyage. She reached Havana on
April 17. and on the 22d took her departure
for Santiago, Cuba, and was captured the
same day by the cruiser New York and
duly condemned. In passing on the merits
of the case the chief Justice held that war
had been practically declared on the 21st.
and that the officers of the vessel must
have known this fact. He dwelt on the
fact that the vessel was proceeding from
a port of the enemy to another port of the
enemy when overtaken, and contended that
the case did not come under any exemption
of the President's message. Th Guldo
case was similar in the main. In this case
Justices Shlras, White and Peckham dis
sented. The court affirmed the opinion of the
Court of Claims in the claim of the Los
Abra Silver Mining Company against the
Republic of Mexico, holding that claim to
be fradulent and unfounded. The claim
was for about $4,000,000. The opinion was
handed down by Justice Harlan, who went
fully Into its history. He said the court,
in passing on the case, incidentally decided
that the signature of the President at
tached to a bill during a recess of Con
gress, If attached within the constitutional
ten days, renders an act so slgnM as valid
as If Congress were in session, the act au
thorizing the Investigation of the claim
having been approved during a Christmas
recess. Justice Harlan raid the essential
requirement was that the President should
sign a bill, and It could not be considered
important whether the signature was at
tached during a recess or when Congress
was actually sitting. If the act was done
within the ten days' time allowed for ex
ecutive examination. He said, however,
the decision on this point did not cover the
legality of executive approval after the
final adjournment of Congress, that point
not being raised.
