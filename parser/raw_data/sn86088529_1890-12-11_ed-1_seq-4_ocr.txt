Certainly uo one will dispute the right
of the new commissioner of tho genera

so desires and confer all the clerkships
at his disposal on friends nnd favorites
of his own No law limits h < preroga
tive In this particular nor Is custom
widely ut vnrlauce with it He is bouud
by no rules of civil service and may ex
ercise the fullest discretion in tbo mutter
ot selecting his assistants This privi
lege Is exercised by every state official
from governor down Each prefers to
have ns assistants men or clerks in full
sympathy with himself on whom he can
reposo the fullest confidence And
each too has his friends to whom be
is under obligations often impossible to
shirk or evnde To resist the impor
tunities of such is not by any means
easy and frequently Impossible Under
the existing system it could not be other
wise Whether the system bo a good or
bad one is from the point Tho exercise
of this prerogative Is limited if at all
by custom to the seleotlon ot clerks and
chiefs ot bureaus or departments known
to be capable nnd efficient The publlo
Interests demand this and It can aot bo
ignored
The publlo cares very little whether a
clerk in the land office Is a friend and
appointee of the present or of o former
administration It only ask3 is he tho
man for the place Is ho qualified by
skill and experience If he is that la
enough end no more questions are

If the new land commissioner intends
o make a clean sweep and laslall o new
clerical force let him do so but let blm
also make sure of his material before

work in that office its complexity and
the magnitude of the interests inrolved
much of it requires fpeclal skill and

For this reason a number of thoso now

different administrations While they
may uot be indispensable they certainly
aro very useful But thnt will not cut

IIOKA2IB81QAX CITIES ARE GOV
LUXLD
Tlie Forum for tho current month con
tains a very interesting nrticlo on city
eoverument in the United States iroin
the pen of Andrew 1 Whlto With
very few exceptions ho considers city
government in this country the worst iu
Christendom the most expensive In
eHioieut and corrupt In our principal
cities everything is at sixes nnd sevens
and nothing is dono according to busi
ness principles The city halls are dens
of corruption whera jobbery venality
and rascality rule triumphant Alder
men are recruited from tho slums and
owo their elevation to bribery corrup
tion and often scoundrelism Men aro
placed in charge of great muulcipal in
terests who if they bad their deserts >
would be inmates of state peniteutiaries
Many of thorn know nothing whatever of
business management are grocsly lgno
runt and would never bo entrusted by
nn individual with tho conduct of tho
commonest business
As a natural consequonco city debts
are enormous tnxntion exorbitant tho
paving lighting and sewering of most of
the principal cities wretched and every
thing douo under municipal control of
the costliest nnd tho worst Every
American returning from Europe is
ashamed of the rotten wooden wharves
and docka that present themsolves to
view at New York nnd Philadelphia
A remarkabla contrast is shown to ex
ist between the wretched government of
American cities nnd tho thorough and
eflicient government of European cities
In London Paris and Ilerlin ono sees
pverywhero evidences of tho nblest
most prudeut and fnrseelng business
management in the opening paving and
lighting of streets the building of mag
nificent qutiya cud docks the construc
ncquoducts nud sewers tho
erection of costly art monuments halls
and city buildings and all without fric
tion without noise or tho interminable
squabbles and disgraceful exposures
of jobbery and corruption that
characterize such undertakings in
American cities Berlin is a city of
1100000 inhabitants mugniflcently
equipped with every modern improve
ment gorgeous in tho splendor of its
public works Its museums halls monu
ments and ptiblio buildings and yet Its
public debt would barely meot tbo yearly
interest of New Yorks enormous debt
The excellence of her municipal man
agement is due to the fact that somo of
tho ablest men of tho German empire
are put at tho head of affairs and bums
and booldera are relegated to the rear
So in other European cities Men of ca
pacity of experience nud knowledge are
entrusted with the control of municipal
nffuirs who see to it that what is done is
well done
The prime causo of the rottenness
prevailing la American municipalities is
attributed to party politics which havo
no place in the government of European
cities Until city government ceases to

THE WEEKLY GAZETTE FORT WORTH TEXAS THURSDAY DECEMBER 11
revulsion against Republicanism Tbo
result was a sweeping condemnation ot
both measures And now in the faca
of that greet popular verdict cones the
president with n reIndorsement and n
fresh recommendation of both He even
turns advocate and argues with foeiga
economists and others to prove to them
that the McKInley tariff Is a blessing
to American Industries and American
workiugmen They are given to un
derstand that In spite of their rejololag
over it the law can be of no benellt to
them since it dlscrimlbales against
where it dees not actually ex
clude their wares and poods lrom
this market Then to show what a
magnificent contempt ha has for con
sistency ho points out the apparent faot
that under the operations of the bill
Importations have Increased rather than
fallen off
Not the least important feature of
tbo mesage is its indorsement of Mr
Blaines reciprocity nostrum But for
the Imperative need of something to be
guile tho farmers and furnish a counter
Irritant for their tariff objections
nothing would induce the president to
adopt Blnlnes reciprocity fouudllng
which ho dandles before the people as
infant kings are sometimes dono to Are
the patriotic heart nud enthuse the
thoughtless multitude lie was in
duced last summer to recommend it to
congress and now that It h a part of
the law employs it as an argument for
ship subsidies without which be consid
ers it practically valueless
The silver question Is touched upon so
far as to express a hope for a safe in
ternational agreement for the free uso
of silver as a coin metal This is tho
nearest approach made in the message
to an unqualified indorsement of tho
double standard and the free use of sil
ver ns money It is probable that if tho
present congress should send hlra a free
coinage bill he would sigu it
Tho recommendntion ou which ho lays
speolal stress is un efficient election law
that will prevent fraud and Injustice
and protect majorities In othor
words he U body and soul for the en
actment of the force bill If enacted
into a law ho can see in it a gain of
twentylive or thirty Republican con
gressmen ut the South but cannot see
j the inevitable loss which hi9 party would
as certainly sustain in tho North to suy
nothing of the social commercial and
race disturbances that would ensue To
these things Harrison is blind Ou
this subject ho Is n true Bourbon
I learning nothing and forgetting nothing
lie Is entirely dominated by partisan
rancor nnd Is hopelessly wedded to his
hideous Idol For that reason Blaine
even could uot move him an inch from
his unholy ground
As congress refused n few months ago
I to pass that bill at bis dictation it will
probably do so acain The South is not
calling for it neither i3 tho West or
i North Nobody wants It but the radl
1 eals greedy for power at any cost As
they do not control the senato tho un
holy scheme of trying to pass it will end
itigloriously once more nnd the rank
I idiocy of the president In Insisting upon
it will become patent to the world as
i It is now to the Amerian public

THE MESSAGE A WIXDFALL TO
DEMOCEAlS
Democrats have cause to thank Heaven
for narrlson He is the Mrs OSheaof
the Republican party nie message to
congress is almost as welcome a windfall
to the Democrats as the transAtlantio
liaison lately the subject of worldwide
gossip was to tho English Tories The
president is said to bo headstrong
and obstinate His message Is proof
enough that he Is Obstinacy hardly
expresses It Mulishness comes nearer
the mark A year ago ho said the
horse was sixteen feet highand be sticks
to It If that is not mulishness what is
it Think ot the recent election and
hnd If you can a milder form of ex
pression for the spirit that prompted
this high tariff force bill messago
The whole world with the exception
of the protected barons and their friends
agreed that the McKInley bill and the
force bill caused tho popular upheaval of
November 4 Other things as for ex
ample Reedlsm wasteful expenditures
nnd a general spirit of profligacy in leg
islation contributed a share But those
two leading measures were the prime
factors that caused the universal popular
