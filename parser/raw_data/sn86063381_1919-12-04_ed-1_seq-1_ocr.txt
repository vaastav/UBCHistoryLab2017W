Please for More Interest
in Navy and Guard
Beltrami, Koochiching and Hub
fcard counties are not taking advant
age of the wonderful opportunities
^afforded them by the Lake Julia
.Sanatorium to fight tuberculosis.
This, in brief, was the message
brought to Bemidji Wednesday by
3r William H. Fbrtin, superintend
ent of the sanatorium, who addressed
the Bemidji Association following
-the noon-day luncheon.
Dr. Fortin gave a most able talk
-concerning the menace of tubercu
losis, expressing regret that while
the sanatorium has a capacity for
:from 24 to 28patients, nine vacan
cies now exist. The doctor outlined
the method by which the sanatorium
is financed, calling attention to the
fact that for every empty bed a pub
lic expenditure of approximately $1,-
800 remains unused, while if cases,
in need of proper attention were
isent to the Lake Julia institution, an
.overflow would result.
Will Name Committee.
The heed of an active committee
-to carry on clinics and other system
atic campaigns for the eradication of
'tiiberiruliffiig'Was* brought "to the "a??
Mention of the association, and fol

point a committee, the duty of which
will be to encourage the holding of
clinics and thorough investigations,
co-operating with the proper offi
cials.
Over 110 Attend.
Attended by more than- 110 busi
ness men of,the city, the meeting was
exceptionally interesting, among
matters discussed being the serious
mess, of the coal situation, methods
of vproper conservation being pre
sented by G. W. Walker, M. & I.
agent in Bemidji. G. W. Harnwell
also spoke concerning the matter.
D. S. Mitchell told of plans ar
ranged for carrying on the Bemidji
Jted Cross Christmas seal campaign,
urging all to subscribe their quota
that Bemidji may go over the top'On
its allotment.
Barker Asks Cooperation.
Lieut. E\ A. Barker) "of the naval
militia, called upon every business
man of the city to take a more ac
tive interest in the campaigns being
made to secure enlistments for the
national guard and naval militia.
He referred to the
benefitsi
will-be
which
received by Bemidj when
these units are organized, arousing
enthusiasm among his listeners,
which is certain to cause a renewal
of interest which will result" in" a
drive for members for these organi
zations, which will not slacken until
their rosters are complete.
A number of other matters were
also disdssed at the meeting.
SENATOR NORD MAY
BE SPECIALLY HONORED
Bemidji's lodge of Elks is plan
ning on a "big time"^onight at the
initiation ceremonies: TO be

duled to be fitted with antlers in the
"most approved fashion.
The lodge feels highly honored by
the fact that State Senator Leonard
H. Nord of International Falls will
be one of the candidates, and, as he
represents Koochiching^ county and
Beltrami county in the Minnesota
senate, it is believed he will be given
special consideration, with all tfye ar
tistict accompaniment.

than 300 names. The peace confer

cretly the question of making effec
tive the treaty of peace with Ger
many. Marshal Foch was present.

Throw New Light O
Miners Strike
At a meeting of the railway men,
held last Sunday, the following com
mittee was appointed for the purpose
of 'securing other labor organizations
to join in a get-to-gether meeting
and secure speakers to better educate
their own men and the general pub
lic.
Otto Morken will represent the
Brotherhood of Engineers, J. T.
Davis the Brotherhood of Firemen,
A. W. Ditty to represent the Brother
hood of Trainmen and Dan O'Con
nor to represent the Brotherhood of
Conductors.
The preliminary meeting, at which
committees from the other labor or
ganizations will be present, has been
scheduled for Sunday afternoon at 1
o'clock "in the Odd Fellows hall.
Pl|na.will be made at this meeting
to carry out a fixed program of edu
cation in order to make more clear
the-stand being taken by the various
labor organizations.
Favor Plumb Plan.
In a conversation with some of the
men, it was brought out that the lo
cal boys favor the Plumb plan of leg
islation, becausethey considerit the!
fairest, hot only to themselves, but
to the public in general. They ad
mit that it is not a perfect piece of
legislation, but .that it can be so
modified and amended that it will
work to. the best interests of all con
cerned.
They state the Plumb Plan does
not mean an increase in wages to the
men in general, as is the opinion of
many, but that it will tend to reduce
the cost of traffic rates, which, they
claim, differs from either the JEsch
or Cummins bills.
Rail Men Sincere.
They are sincere in their demands
of congress to retain the railroads
under government control for at
least two years, that the people may
have sufficient time to study the
problem and approach it from the
angle of the public welfare.
The^emands made by the miners
for a six-hour day and a five day
week was also emphasized by the
members of the local organizations
at the Civic and Commerce associa
tion- quarters Wednesday. The dis
cussion took place, directly after the
regular noon day luncheon.
New View of Miners.
"The miners are not demanding a
six-hour day and a five day week,"
said one of the men, "but their de
mand is1
that they be given at least
this much time to work each week.
During the war the average time put
in by the miners was twenty-two
hours a week,, which was not enough
to keep them going.
"The mine operators simply laid
the men off when they had accumu
lated enough coal to keep up ship
ments and then put them back to
work when the supply had been
shipped out. These facts are just
coming out and, when the people
learn all the facts they wil Hook upon
the laboring demands from a differ
ent angle."
The members of the local organi
zations are utterly opposed to "Red
Flaggers" and bolshevik sym
pathizers, and appear to be absolute
ly sincere in doing the things that
are for the public good.
NO. DAKOTA RATIFIES

state in the union to ratify the wom
an's suffrage amendment when the

for women in this state which began

ture adopted Dakota's first suffrage
amendment, which was vetoed by
Governor Pierce.

Fjelde, alumnus of Valley City nor
mal, is making a bust of Ibsen for
presentation to the state university
at Grand Forks. Fjelde's father and

"Kidding" Notes

death in the electric chair, confront
ed William Carlisle, train bandit, as
he lay in Douglas hospital with a

Carlisle was shot down in a cabin
Tuesday by Sheriff A. S. SSaell oil
Whiteland as the bandit, cornered,
reached for an automatic pistol to
give battle. The posse had trailed
Carlisle since Sunday morning
through a bitter blizzard.
The outlaw who had eluded pur
suit since his escape from the state
prison at Rawlins on November 15
and subsequent robbery of the Los
Angeles limited train near Medicine
BUw November 18, was strapped to
a pack horse for the descent of .Lara
mie peak, eighteen miles southwest
of here, then bundled into an auto
mobile and rushed to this city.
Just what disposition will be maSe
of him has not been determined. He
was serving a life sentence which
had been commuted to twenty-five
from fifty years when he escaped. In
the meantime a new crime, for which
death is the possible penalty has
been committed by 'the outlaw.
Carlisle will not die from his
wound. He lived clean, has a strong
physique and hag more than a fight
ing chance to beat death, his physi
cians say. "I don't blame you for
shoo'ting," was the only statement
the wounded outlaw had to make.

DEER SEASON ENDS

(By United Press.)
St. Paul, Dec. 4.Hunting season
in the north woods was practically

ends. Anyone caught with a deer or
a moose after today will come under
suspicion at once.
Thousands of deer have been killed
during the season and many moose
were secured by the more hardy
woodsmen. Baggage and express cars
have been overloaded with deer dur
ing the last two weeks, as hunters
came back from their trips. All re
ported deer plentiful, but some re
turned minus their prizes. While all
admitted there were plenty there,
some were forced to admit they were
not good enough huntsmen to get
them.
The season was marked by the
small number of casualties. Hunters
were using greater caution, It is be

The fisher, mink, muskrat and

backwoodsmen are expected to devote
much of their time this winter to

this winter than ever before, and fur
buyers report a greater demand than

can Affair Demands
By Hugh Bailee.
(United Press Correspondent.)
Washington, Dec. 4.The attitude
of the administration today, with re
gard to the peace treaty, is that of
"watchful waiting."
Believeing that a great popular
demand for ratification will come
from the country within a few weeks.
President Wilson is keeping hands
off the present situation, waiting for
this urge to materialize.
The president refrained from di
rectly mentioning the treaty In his
message to congress, it is believed,
with the idea that further argument
was useless. The need for it, friends
of the administration predict, will
steadily become more apparent.
They are looking for events to con
vince people that the treaty is de
sirable.
