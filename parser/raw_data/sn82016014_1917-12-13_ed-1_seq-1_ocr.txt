The Post correspondent, who re

making up what i known as the
"Wild Division" of Cavaliers of St.

The remaining Bolsheviki were sur
rounded and dealt with very dras

Counter revolutionary efforts
against the Bolsheviki appear to have
received a setback in the reported de
feat of General Korniloff in a battle
in south central Russia. Unofficial
advices contain the rumor that Gen
eral Korniloff was wounded and that
his capture by the Bolsheviki is antic
ipated. According to the report received in
London the battle was fought between
Bielgorod in the province of Kursk,
and Sumu, in the province of Khar
kov, approximately 300 miles south of
Moscow. The probable capture by the
Bolsheviki of Kostov-on-the-Don, the
largest town in the Don Cossack terri
tory, is also reported, the dispatch
adding that indications are that the
Cossack uprising will fail and the Cos
sacks will enter the extremist ranks.
Kostov is 250 miles southeast of Biel

constituent assembly altho available
returns from the elections show that
the Bolsheviki alone hardly have a
majority in the assembly. Orders for

most of whom are supporting the Cos
sack revolt, have been issued by the
oisneviKi.

Hutchinson. Kan.. Dec. 13. Confis

and Eldorado is reported by Emerson
Carey, state fuel administrator, who,
was notified of their action. He says
he is powerless to act, if residents of
a town decide they need coal and take
it out of a car standing in the railroad
yards.
Joe E. Wallace of Wallace, in north
west Kansas, reported citizens there
were planning to take over1 the first
car of coal which passed thru town

General Crozier replied that work
