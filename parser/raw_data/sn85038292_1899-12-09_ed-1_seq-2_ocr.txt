SATURDAY, DECEMBER 9, 1899.
The Fifty-Sixth Congress.
The Fifty-Sixth Congress, which began its
first session last Monday, has confronting it
the most important problems any Congress
has had to deal with since the early days ot
the republic. Upon the wisdom, patriotism
and sound judgment with which they are met
and determined depends not only the happi
ness of the people but the very existence ofa
republican form of government. For nearly
forty years the government has been drifting
away from the safe anchorage of the Consli -
tution, the Declaration of Independence, the
teachings of the Fathers of the Republic, the
advice of Washington and Jackson, and from
the Monroe Doctrine. Shall it continue to
drift away from all these, or return to the
purposes of the founders of the contederacy,
will be determined by the action of the Fifty-
Sixth Congress.
The country has reached a point when it
must be determined whether a monetary sys
tem established by the Fathers and existed
for over eighty years, until a money power
destroyed it, in effect, shall be re-established,
or a gold monometallism, as forced and up
held by a combination of bangs and capital,
shall be maintained.
This problem, however, is tar less import
ant than the question of territorial expansion,
foreign entanglements and militarism. It is
a domestic matter solely and cau easily lie
settled.
A war begun for “humanity’s sake,’ an
unnecessary and defenceless war upon an un
offending government —-a war that was an in
termeddling with the affairs of a friendly
power—has resulted in the annexation of
foreign lands and foreign peoples, and an ex
pensive war in blood and treasure in an at
tempt to extend our jurisdiction over an un
willing people. The Congress of the United
States declared that the purpose of the war
with Spain was not for territorial aggrandize
ment, and McKinley declared that “Forcible
annexation would be criminal aggression.'
The conduct of the McKinley Administration
since has negatived the declaration of Con
gress and the words of the President. In
reaching out tor island possessions we have
annulled the Monroe Doctr.ne, and in at
tempting to subjugate he Filippinos c have
disgraced the Declaration of Independence.
It is now left for Congress to determine
whether the McKinley Administration shall
go on with its policy of territorial expansion
and militarism, or whether we shall retrace our
steps , and rest secure and safe la-hind the
Constitution, the Declaration of Indepen ;
dence, the advice of Washington and Jackson
and the Monroe Doctrine.
While Congress should take up and settle
these questions it is nut at all certain they will
be determined. It is likely supposed party
welfare will have precedence over patriotic
duty, and both questions may be left open for
supposed party advantage.
We are on the ere of a national election.
If Congress fails to act. and act lor the gen
eral welfare of the people, the people them
selves will determine matters in their own
way at the polls next year.
Col. John Walter Smith, recently elected
Gorernor, was sworn in as a member t the
House of Representatives on Monday, when
Congress met. His term began last March,
though there had been no session since that
time. He will resign hi -a; before h.< ter <
a. Governor inl - ' a
special election will he held to fill the vacancy
thus caused.
The President's Message.
President McKinley sent bis third annua
message to Congress on Tuesday. It is the
longest document ol the kind submitted to
Congress for some years. As stated by some
journal, tbe message is a wealth of history b it
a dearth of recommendations. By the C.n
slitution the President is obliged to lay before
every Congress at its first meeting in regular
session a report of the condition in the coun
try and the operations of the government for
tbe past year. As the country has expanded,
under the guidance of the Hanna-McKinley
Administration, so the Annual Message has
expanded. Its chief value i- in tbe relation
of facts for the information of Congress, ibe
action of that body is what will most concern
the country, for the President makes but few
recommendations. As to tbe disposition ot
tbe newly acquired possessions the message is
silent, except that that matter is for the de
termination of Congress.
Upon the money question the President is
explicit and direct in urging the establish
ment of tbe single gold standard. Two bills
to accomplish this were prepared prior to the
meeting of Congress, one by a Senate Com -
millee and one by a House Committee. Tbe
bills differ materially, and it is not at all un
likely that the House may pass its measure
and the Senate fail to act. so as to have the
money question an issue in the Presidential
campaign next year. The Republican party
is a braid of the issue of territorial expansion
and militarism, and would like to overshadow
it with tbe financial question. Hence the
President omits recommendations as to for
eign acquisitions and no Congressional Com
mittee has formulated a bill in reference to
them.
Secretary Long of the Navy recommends
the building of eighteen war ships. They
have become necessary to carry out the Mc-
Kinley policy of expansion. To build and
keep them in service will cost m-ire than the
island possessions are worth, uol counting the
lives that will be lost by disease and by bul
lets in keeping the natives in subjection.
Roberta Excluded
Congressman Brigham H. Roberts, of I tab,
was not sworn in as a member of the House
last Monday. He is charged with having a
plurality of wives, against the laws of the
United Stales and of Utah, and the charges
have been referred to a special committee.
In the meantime he is not only denied partic
ipation in the proceedings of the House, bat
even a seat in the ball. The due election of
Roberts is not questioned, and the House has
ventured on dangerous ground in denying
him admission. He should have been sworn
in along with the other members and the
House could have investigated any matters
connected with him it desired. By this
action Roberts is convicted without a hear
ing, and a sovereign state, is deprived of
a portion of its representations. When a
Representative is sent to Congress it is doubt
ful whether the House or the Senate has
power to investigate anything not directly
connected with the question of election. Tht
people are supposed to determine the per
sonal fitness of their representatives.
In the last House of Representatives, electee
is 1896, the Republicans had a majority of 8:
over the Democrats and 53 over all —Demo
crats, Populists and Silverites. In the Housi
which convened last Monday, elected in 1898
the Republicans have hut 12 majority ove
the Democrats, a less of 70. and only 3 ma
jority over all.
Dispatches from Manila last week iudicatei
tbe collapse of Agninaldo’s resistance, tha
his army had dispersed into small bands, am

This week dispatches report the departure o
more United States troops to Manila.
' Testimonial to Chairman Vandiver.
In view of the unceasing labors of Hon.
Murray Vandiver, Chairman of the Demo
cratic State Central Committee, for the unity
and success of the Democratic parly a num
ber of Democrats proposed to present him
with a testimonial in appreciation of his ser
vices. A large meeting of prominent Demo
crats was held recently at the Carrollton
Hotel, Baltimore, to consider the matter and
take action. An organziation was effected
with Gen. Lloyd L. Jackson chairman, and a
committee of twenty-five was selected to carry
out the purpose to present Mr. Vandiver with
a suitable token of appreciation of his untir
ing labors in behalf of the redemption of the
slate from Republican ring rule and incom
petency. If party service merits recognition,
and it surely does, Chairman Vandiver is en
titled to a large measure of it. For three
years he has kept Democratic headquarters j
open all the yeat through at the Carrollton,
where he has met and talked over men and
measures with Democrats all over the state,
learning and studying the situation of the
party. By this means he was able to direct :
the campaign with singular good judgment, |
and that brought success.
Tbe committee in charge of the movement i
to present a testimonial to Mr. Vandiver de
sire to make it a state matter and give to ail |
Democrats an opportunity to join in the tes
limenial. To that end contributions will lie |
accepted in any amount from one dollar up, j
which may be sent tc James Bond, Equitable j
Building, Baltimore. With the testimonial
to Mr. Vandiver will also be presented an
album with tbe names of all contributors in- j
scribed therein. Carroll should be well re
presented iu the album.
