THE AMBITION OP SOUTH CAROLINA.
A correspondent at Charleston, of ft New
YorV citjr paper, says : I
" Any ofTeri of compromise in relation to the '
hi aver j question which, ruay hare place In the
proceedings of Congrev, will prove utterly vain
no far -as South Carolina is concerned. An)
concessions to slavery will net meet her cose.
She considers the anli slavery movement us ,
only one or her grievances. She wants freo !
trade, and l.e will have it. Shu ii hound to '
make her seaport ft great city. What Paris is ,
tv France that Charleston is to South Carolina t
nnd Charleston will have her y. both in and I
out of the Convention and the Legislature.
Iflhcre ever was a case of sheer unit persist
cnt " bambtoilement," as Colonel Benton would
call It, If he was now living, it is the attempt to
mislead the country Into the belief that any
grievance in respect to slavery is the cause ol
the nulliGcation of South Carolina.
The undisputed thronology of affairs is, that I
the negro was not taken up as a pretext, until .
1835, although General Jackson, as early as i
1833, predicted that the negro would perform
that part; whereas nullification, with all the
theories, and projects, and local ambitions,
which constitute its vitality at this day, was in
full blast in 1830-'32.
It is to make Charleston the political and
commercial metropolis, "the Paris" of the
South, that tho Union is to be dissolved, and
not to right tho wrongs of slaveholders.
Undoubtedly, the fears and hopes and pas
sions of slaveholders have been played upon,
and will continue to be played upon, but they
will see, in the end, and perhaps soon, that
they aru really to be sacrificed to the local
projects of a single city and a single State.
VIRGINIA AND Mil. HUNTER.
The position of Senator Hunter upon the
question of dUuuion is very naturally the sub
ject of constant ciiticism in this District and
in Virginia.
His Utter to the Richmond inquirer, as we
have already had occasion t" cibserve, contnim i
an elaborate presentation of the reasons whidrj
urge Virginia to follow South Carolina, if that
State should take tbe finul step of disruption,
although Mr. Hunter professes to deprecate
such action on the part of the Palmetto politi
cians. Considering that those politicians would
hardly push matters to extremity, if they did
not count upon the ultimate co operation of the
border slave Slates, and that they certainly
would not push matters to extremities, if they
did not count upon the resistance of the border
slave States to any measure of Federal coer
cion, it must be obvious that nothing could be
better adapted to encourage them in their pres
ent policy than just such a letter as Mr. Hun
ter has written, and it is not treating that gen
tleman with indecorum, or disrespect, to as
sume that he understood perfectly what tbe ef
fect of his letter would be. 1( his language in
this letter had been his language in Senatorial
debate, it would not be doing him injustice,
from his known coolness and reserve, to have
insisted that he knew and intended the exact
results calculated to be produced by his words,
and this inference becomes all the more irre
sistible, from a letter, not responsive to any in
quiry, or provocation, but coolly and volunta
rily penned iu his own private leisure.
It is not material to the present inquiry, to
discuss the considerations which would or
should control Virginia in a contingency
which has not yet happened. So far as he has
done so, Mr. Hunter may have argued well, or
ill, but can there be any reasonable doubt ol
the motive which prompted him to anticipate
events, and to assure the nullifiers of South
Carolina, in advance, that they might rely upon
Virginia at last? Would a friend of the Union
as it is, even if concurring with Mr. Hunter ns
to what an eventual and possible necessity
might require Virginia to do, be likely to en
courage disunion, by admitting this necessity
at the present time ?
The conviction is gaining ground in Vir
ginia, and rests, as it teems to us, upon im
pregnable grounds, that Mr. Hunter has not
changed since his election, as a Calhoun null i
fier, to the office of Speaker of tbe Uonse, that
his deprecation of the course of South Carolina
is insincere, and that the only part of his re
cent letter which exhibits his reul tendencies,
is that iu which, with such zeal and eloquence
and unmistakable relish, he portrays the gold
en but imaginary prosperity which awaits the
Commonwealth of Virginia detached from the
Union of Washington and Jefferson and Madi
son and Monroe.
General Cusmtfo. Mr. Wilson's letter to
this gentleman traces his whole career, as an
abolition demagogue before he was elected to
Congress, and an abolition agitator while in
Congress. It even shows him, only two years
ago, in the Massachusetts Legislature, denounc
ing as " extraordinary " a claim in behalf of the
Southern States, which he now pronounces it
moral treason to resist. If a man could be
killed off by proving his inconsistency and hy
pocrisy, General Cushiug is effectually dis
posed of; but he is made of material which will
enable him to survive it all.
MK.CuiTrLXDfc.s- In the Washington cor
respondence of the New York Tribune of Sat
urday, wo notice the following paragraph :
" The Kentucky delegation have held a meet
ing, and exchanged views fully and frankly.
Mr. Crittenden will present the nroDosi'ion
published in my dispatch a few days ago, as the
ultimatum of the South, and, failing to obtain
it or some equivalent from the North, he will
justify Kentucky in cooperating with the se
cession movement."
We are enabled to say, with very great con
fidence, that the writer of this paragraph has
been misled, as to the views, both of Mr. Crit
tenden and of the Kentucky delegation.
Personal. Hon. Augustus Sthell. N. Y..
and Col. W, I). Lewis, Philadelphia, are at
Wiuara3.
Wm. Resack, Belgium, aud Hon. D. Mere
tilth, Ky., are at the KIrkwood House.
WILL UK RESIGN?
The President was waited upon by a commit
tee of his political friends, day before yesterday,
with n request that he should resign. It was said
to him, in so many words, that ho was never in
his best days equal to an emergency, and that,
nt aw rate, hn was now disaualified br ace.
Tho interview of last Monday between th6
President and Messrs. Gwin nnd Midell, occur
red ns reported, only tho actual language of
Mr. Buchanan was much ttronger than what
has been published. After stating to those
Senators, that it was their advice which had
involved himself nnd tho country in the pres
ent difficulties, he ended by expressing his
wish never to tee either of them again.
In due time, after tbe actors in the enormi
ties of the lost four years have thoroughly quar
reled with each other, we shall get some " se
el els of the prison houst," which will amaze
the world.
Tiie Secrktaut ok War. The Charleston
papers publish the following as a part of a let
tir to Governor Gist; from a distinguished
source :
" WAsmxoTON-, Dec. 5, 1860.
"Tear Sir: I have just had a a conversation
with' the Secretary ot War. He says: 'You
may say to the people of South Carolina, there
will be no more troops sent to the forts at
Charleston. I will icsign before it shall be
done."
The Secretary of State, on tho other hand,
has resigned because it was not done.
Nobody doubts here now that Mr. Keitt was
justified in the public statement which hemado
some weeks ago, that the President had com
mitted and pledged himself to the nullifiers not
to oppose any resistance to their treason. And
the hope that Mr. Buchanan will break away
from these pledges grows fainter and fainter
with each succeeding duy.
NOR1H CAROLINA.
The Charlottes dlo Obsarrcr snj s :
" We tell our North Carolina Iriends, that
if this Union should be disolud, (and we have
scnrcelv a hopu that it will not be,) the very
lust thing that they should do would by to
unite her with these cotton SUtcs, tho chief
one of whu.li (South Carolina) is this day less
ultaehed to North Carolina than New York or
Pentisvlvaiinia is. No, no! If we have to
eparate Irom the Norih, let us either set up
fur ourselves or join the conservative border
States, Marvl.inrl, Virginia, Kentucky, and
Tennessee. With these we have interests in
common, and feeling in common. But a Con
federacy of the cotton Slates would reopen the
slave trade, in suite of the interests and feel
ings of the 'border Slates,' and would shape
all its legislation to the advancement of the cot
ton interests. 1 he tnriff policy ol the United
States, against which South Carolina wanted
to nullify, was nothing to what tho farming
Slates would experience at the hands of 'king
cotton.' Preserve us from such friends! who
openly tell us that they intend to force us to
join them or to emancipate our slates. If we
are freemen, we will tell 4hera that we will do
neither the one nor-the other.''
THE CRISIS COMMITTEE.
The Crisis Committee sat four hours on Fri
day, and then adjourned over till Monday.
Mr. Kellogg, of Illinois, spoke nearly two hours
to disabuse erroneous impressions concerning
the Republican platform and purposes, and to
show that Mr. Lincoln's record and speeches
exempted him from any suspicion of an inten
tion or desire to interfere with slavery where it
existed by law.
Mr. Corwin then addressed the committee
in a conciliatory speech, and closed by present
ing a proposition substantially to the effect,
that the Territories should be allowed to elect
all their own officers, which arc now appointed
by the President, and that, upon attaining pop
ulation enough to authorize one member of
Congress, they should be admitted as States
with or without slavery, us they might elect.
Mr. Rust, of Arkansas, propofed to amend
by a provision that slavery might go into the
Territories, and be protected there during their
Territorial condition.
Mr. Curtis introduced a series of resolutions,
declaring secession to be revolution, and in
volving war, and pledging the committee to
sustain the Union ut all hazard'.
This led to animated expression from South
ern members, who declared, if conciliation was
the object, it could not be attained by such
means.
Mr. Curtis then withdrew the resolutions
temporarily, but- they will probably he renewed
' on some future occasion, m.d the sense of the
committee tested.
Some general but unimportant discussion fol
lowed, aud tho subject was postponed for an
other meeting. It is very evident, from all the
indications, that the extreme South intend to
demand protection for slavery in the 'I errito
ries as a sine qua non, and that, failing to ob
tain it prompily, the Gulf States will secede,
with the expectation, however, of being invited
to return, under new guaranties, or with what
they call reconstruction. This is the programme,
in plain term", however disguised it may be by
evasions or generalities.
The city has been considerably excited the
two luit days by rumors that President Bu
chanan, Secretary Thompson, and General
Scott, had resigned their positions, So far as
we have been able to ascertain, there is no
foundation for these report:.
We understand that the President has re
solved to appoint Attorney General Black to
the vacant Secretaryship of State, and that his
nomination will be cent to the Senate to-day.
Secretary Thompson leaves this morning, to
attend tho Charleston Convention. Moses
Kelly, tbe Chief Clerk, will act as Secretary
during tbe absence of Mr. Thompson.
We are pleased to annouce that Postmaster
General Holt aud Second Assistant Postmaster
General Dundas were both muc'l better last
evening.
The examination iu the rase of tbe slave
barque Cora was resumed Friday afternoon,
before United States Commissioner Morell, and
three witnesses were examined.
Activity of the Afiucah Slave Trade.
The Navy Department received dispatches
Friday morning from the African squadron,
stating that the steamer San Jacinto had cap
tured the brig Bonito, with n cargo of seven
hundred and fifty slaves. Commander Inman
reports gi eat activity on the part of vessels en
gaged in this inhuman traffic. A large num
ber of suspicious looking vessels are constantly
seen hovering about in various localities, evi
dently watching an opportunity to secure car
goes and escape without detection.

Report says that the President is no way fa

Secretnry of tho Treasury, holding on to that
position, and has shown his want of confidence
in him by departing from the usual custom,

of the Treasury Department after the resigna

Clayton may become the sensation and seces

A Revolutionary Relic Gone. Hannah
Carroll, a negro woman, about ninety-six years
oi age, uieu suuuemy 01 ouopiexy at ner resi
dence in New York, on Thursday afternoon.
Deceased, it appeared, was a native of Wash
ington, I). C, and is said to have acted as cook
for General Washington during the Revolu
tionary war. For upwards of twenty years she
has been residing with a family named Williams,
at the above number. Aunt Hannah, as she
was called, was well known, and received pecu
niary aid from the first families in the city.
She boasted of her acquaintance with tbe

regularly in tbe summer season to the St.
Nicholas and other hotels, to see some of her
old friends from the South.

and wicked sacrifice of her husband's life, who,
she declares, will never surreuder the place,

No Pliiversion of the Am to the Scf
febehs of Kansas. We wish our Republican
exchanges at the East would reiterate the fact
that no arms or ammunition whatever have
been sent to Montgomery from the East,
marked as "relief goods," "relief for Kansas,"
nor anything of the kind. If he and his men
have arms, they are such as have been in the
Territory for years. Neither have any provis
ions been sent to Montgomery or his men.
Hardly a pound of the relief provisions has
been sent to Linn county at all, although the
people of that county are as deserving of as
sistance as any in the Territory. The report that
the contributions of the East have been per
verted to tbe supply of Montgomery is utterly
false, and is circulated by pro-slavery and Dem
ocratic journal1! to prevent aid from from be
ing extended to our suffering people. Law
icnee Republican.
Relief Provisions Faiuxo. We under
stand that from 100 to 160 teams from tho in
terior are now in Atchison, waiting for sup
Sliest, which hare given out, A recent acci
ent (the breaking of a bridge) on the Hanni
bal and St. Joseph railroad, hat detained some
of the provisions which were' en route for the
Territory. The infamous falsehood of Judge
Williams, that, under the guise of " relief
goods," supplies, arms, Ac, were being sent to
Montgomery, has been made a pretext by some
of the railroad companies for raising tbe
freights, which caused some embarrassment
It is hoped, however, that recent contributions
will soon arrive, so that 'tho relief committee
will not be obliged to send any of the needy
empty away. Rut If now, In the first days of
December, difficulty begins to be realized in
supplying the wants of the destitute, what shall
we see in February or March, in May or June?
God only knows what is to become of our peo

From Panama. By tho North Star, we
learn that the Chilian Congress had extended
the extraordinary powers of the President until

Both Houses had sanctioned the bill by
which authors or abettors of mutinies, riots, or
seditious movements, are jointly answerable for
the losses and damages caused thereby.
Congress has also sanctioned the project
S resented by the Government for sending a
linister to the Court of Rome.
The Arancanian Indians hare again made a

inent, the Government Bent the steam frigate

The dates from Callao are to November 14.
Mr. Clay would leave in a few days, in the
Wyoming, homeward bound.
The revised Constitution of Peru has been
accepted, sworn to, aud published.
Congress has in secret session conferred ex
traordinary powers upon President Costilla,
with reference to the present difficulties with
Bolivia. It is therefore thought by mauy that
tfastilla will not content himself by simply
overthrowing Dr. Linares, but will probably
try to annex Bolivia to Peru.
A letter from Lima says that Castilla is to
raise an urmy of 30,000 men to operate against
Bolivia. The letter adds :
"It is the general opinion of the people who
know both tho Bolivian and Peruvian armies,
thut the foiraer will gain the victory iu the
coming struggle ; at least, if old Gen. Brown
commands the Bolivians, as it is said, and
Castilla the Peruvians, the latter are sure of a
sound thrashing."
TUB TREASURY.
The condition of the Treasury is far wore
than is understood by the public, or disclosed
in the weekly statements. It has not been so
bad ut any time since 1814, when Treasury
uotcs were sold at 25 per cent, discount Over
drafts amounting to $250,000 have been made
on New York, nnd orders have been dispatched
to St Louis to transfer $300,000 sent there to
pay army and other demands, to New York, to
satisfy these drafts. There are only a few hun
dred thousand dollars in all the depositories,
scattered in small sums, and thus rendered un
available at any particular point. The Mint
fund, which is rarely touched for any other
purpose, is exhausted, and there are warrants
amounting to $2,000,000 on the Secretary's
table, which are not signed, because they can
not be paid. Mr. Thomas will take immediate
steps to secure the payment of interest on the
public debt, due on the 1st of January, if all
other demands have to be temporarily post
poned. Soon after Mr. Cobb came into office, ho re
deemed the Government loan at a premium of
16 per cent., to relieve the plethoric Treasury,
and the day he went out it was sold at 15 per
cent, discount. So much for Democratic ability
and economy. A'. Y. Tribune Cor.
