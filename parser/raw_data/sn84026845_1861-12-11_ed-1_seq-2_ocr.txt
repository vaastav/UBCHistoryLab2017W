of Henry Clay, August 1st, 1850.
Parsoh BBOWVLOir'bas preached an ex
cellent sermon to the rebel* at Morristownf
in East Tennessee. Morristown la in Jef
feraon county, forty-two miles by railroad
northeait of Knoxville, where the parson
lately lived. It was announced some days
ago that the gallant parson bad suddenly
disappeared. Some feared that he had
been taken prisoner. Bat it is now appar
ent that be has been using bis time to
good purpose. The Union men of East
Tennessee have single banded and alone
won a victory over the rebels who were
sent to overpower them. This, the Mem
phis Avalanche, received in Cincinnati,
concedes. The constancy, bravery an J pa
tience of these patriots aro bffyond all
praise, and when the history of this con
tent ia written none of the brave comba
tants will deserve a more conspicnons
place on the roll of honor than the indom
table heroes of East Tennessee.
1f?e wbo are ao far away cannot refrain
from expressions of impatience at the long
delay in getting onr soldiers tbroogh Cum
berland Gap. How much harder most it
be for those true-hearted men, who are in j
the mountains of East Tennessee, sur
rounded by rebel armlcB on every side??
Long have tbey looked for help. But
week after week, and month after month
have passed away, and still onr armies lin
ger in Kentucky. And now the gallant %
fellows, instead of.losing heart and giving j
np in despair, have seised snch arms as '
tbey could find, and have, with their own
right arms, struck a decisive blow.' Shall
not snch men q<pon receive the help tbey
need ? We confess that anxious as we are
to hear of advances and victories all along
our lines, it would thrill us with a higher
joy to hear of tbp deliverance of Bast Ten
nessee than of any other single achieve
ment.
Qlad are we to see it stated,.-and we hope
It is true, that the day of her deliverance
is nigh. Troops for the last three weeks
have been pouring into Kentucky from
Ohio and Pennsylvania, Indiana and Illi
nois, until now we must have from 75,000
to 100,000 men in the State. The larger
portion of this force is of course destined
to operate against the rebels at Bowllog
Green. But General Schoefl"is reported to
be on the point of attacking Zolllcofier
near Somerset,.on the Cumberland river,
liay we soon bear that be has defeated
him, and opened the way to the fields
which the Union men of East Tennessee .
have made sacred by their patriotism.
The editor of the N. Y. Commercial Ad
vtriUtr has seen a *pair of Virginia made
shoes, such as sold for $2 60 at Ricbmoud
last May, but probably worth double that
price at present. The leather Is guiltless
of* polish, and inflexible as iron. The
workmanship is primitive, the vamps and
quartet a being joined together by means of
?ma!l tacks, The only stitching appears
on the soles, which, < however, ?* are so far
apart as to permit easilj^the insertion of a
penny between-tbem:*the stftcWes'average
half- an inch apart, the material used being
apparently hempen twine spun In afkfitory.
The* several 'layers of the heels project
over one another to the. extent of.one
eighth of an.inch, the maker never think
ing it worth while to dress the edges or
color them. A dozen small nails in each
hold that appendage In its place and pro
trude rather an Inconvenient length through
the insole. A single hole in each quarter
permits the insertion of a piece of cotton
twln^*to lacft the shoes, which ;a^e made
to suit either foot,' according to conveni
ence.., ., .,
"In times like these,when every reflective
mind fs weighed down by the national
anxieties, the names of parties and parti
sans ought to be detestable; All citizens
should Join, as with one mind, in prosecu
ting that great and noble war whi^h is on
our Hands, and in 'defeating every friepd of
Section, whether open or secret." ..So
says tbe^patriotic Y. Pott.
The direction* issued by the Secretary
of the Treasury for making * proper dls
position of the property of rebels which
is found within our lines, are very judi
cions. A great deal will be obtained not
withstanding the threats to diatroy all the
crops. The arrangement for the employ
ment of the negroes is wise. The records
kept of the property takenf will enable the
Government to remunerate any loyal men
where property may be seized. It is a kind
noss to the whites at tbeSoutb.as well as the
negroes to find regular work for the latter.
If unemployed and left to stroll from plan
tation to plantation without restraint, they
would not be likely to do themselves or
any one else much good. They would be
tempted to plunder, were it only for the
sake of getting something to eat and
drink. It is the doty of the Government
for the present, to organise them and em
ploy them, whatever disposition may ul
timately be made of them. We see no
necessity for arming them; though if the
! alternative were to arm tbem and restrain
I their vengence by military discipline, or, on
the other hand, to permit Ihem to wreak it;
i In insurrectionary violence, it would be a
; mercy to the rebels for us to adopt the for
( mer course.
Some of the property, which has already
| been desU-oyed, could probably have been
saved, if the main object of our army had
| been the seisme of rice and cotton. Bo*
the object in sending onr soldiers to the
South is not to plunder. They go to ac
j complirh a military end. The seizure of
property is altogether subsidiary.
The shipment of cotton by our Govern
I ment and the destruction of it by the reb
els mnst open the eyes of the English and
French manufacturers who have blamed us
because they could not obtain cotton.
They see that the rebels mean to use their
cotton so as to force the world to termB, if
they can.
"Osk of the most gratifying features of
the opening of Congress," says the New
York Times, is the evidence afforded by the
published Executive documents, of the
substantial harmony ot sentiment among
the gentlemen associated with the Presi
dent in the conduct of the Government.
This is still more gratifying, from the fact
tbat rumors widely circulated bad pre
pared the public miod for a very different
j state of things. It was known that the
i private and expressed opinions of some
j members of the Cabinet, concerning the
? relations of slavery to tbe war, were some
I what at variance with those which the
| President had made the basis of his official
| action. And it was said that they intend
ed to embody those opinions in their an
nual reports, and spread them thus official
ly before the country, without regard to
their bearing on the general policy ot the
Administration. The result, says the
7Vm?, shows that these rumors were un
founded, and that whatever differences of
sen timent may have existed, have been
reconciled or waived in deference to the
overwhelming emergency Which weighs
upon" the country. It is stated that
?Mr. Cameron, after preparing his report,
Consented to omit sundry suggestions
which he had made in the original copy
concerning the disfranchisement of slaves
and their employment in the army, upon
finding tbat tbey transcended the policy
which the President deems best adopted to
the exigencies of the war under existing
circumstances.
The Timet says tbe account given by the
Tribune of tbo difference between the Pres
ident and Secretary Cameron in regard to
amending the leport of tbe latter, is gross
ly unjust to tbe President. It represents
Mr. Cameron as obstinately refusing to
strike from bis report matter that the Pres
ident regarded as extraneous, and conniv
ing at the publication of the report na
originally written, In defiance of the wish
es und commands, even, of the President.
It is sufficient lo say that tbe President
would never have tolerated any such con
tumacy, if it bad*been exhibited, and
equally clear that Mr. Cameron understands
ths proprieties of official life too well to
have conducted in such a style. The truth
is that Mr. Cumeron yielded to the sugges
tions of the President, and himself amend
ed his report by striking out such parts as
the President objected to, agreeing to sup
p(ut the President's views fully and cor
dially. On no other condition would be,
or could he, have remained an hour in the
Cabinet.
In one of the towns in the Southern part
of Virginia, as a regiment of rebel volun
teers were about leaving for the seat of
war, a neighboring parson in addressing
the rebels on their dnties as soldiers, &c.,
told them that "having put their hand to
the plough they must never look back.?
Remember," said be, "the fate of Lot's
wife, who for looking back was turned into
a pillar of salt." At-this juncture a hold
"aecesb," wtro did not exactlythe ap
plication, and had just been luxuriating on
a piece of fresh calf without seasoning!
suddenly starting up, threw his cap in the
air hud sung out lustily,. "Hooray for salt
?Bully for Lot's wife."

We noticed the prospectus of this new
paper a few days ago. Wo received the
first issue yesterday. It is a promising
sheet, and we wish it well. The editor
has had difficulties la getting his enter
prise thas far along, which shonld be du
ly appreciated'by the good people of Mar
ion county. The salutatory concludes
thus:
The ; destiny of Western Virginia is:
henceforth foiward, and upward, and the j
new era that is ' dawning upon her will be
her brightest and happiest.
A plucky little British middy recently
slapped the august cars of his royal high
ness Prince Alfred, who thereupon indig
nantly reported to tbo officers In command.
Investigation showed that the indignity
was the result of princely impertinence,
and all the. satisfaction which his highness
got, therefore, was a piece of advice to the
effect that in fatnre ha bad better keep a'
civil tongue in bis head.
A "Camp Kettle" all tbe way from
South Carolina.
We bare received a copy of a little sheet
about the size of a twelve mo., named tbe
Gamp Kettle. It it got np, ??run" and ed
ited by. the boys of tbe .Pennsylvania
Roundhead regiment, at Port Royal, South
Carolina, many of whom are from our
neighboring county of Washington.
The following paragraph in the Kettle is
marked for our attention:
"Aboat eight o'clock on tbe nigbt after
the late naval victory, tbe moon rode high
in the Hearens, and one of those rare and
?beautiful -sights that are witnessed bat
once or twice in a life time, was
presented to the thousands of upturned
eyes from our floating palaces abreast tbe
fallen fort. A magnificent prismatic circle
surrounded It for more than an hour, and
tbe sight of the red, white and blue encir
cling tbe luminary, after the scenes of the
day, gave it a significance that went to
the heart of every loyal man in that fleet,
and cheer alter cheer went up from joyous
lips, and full hearts, while the national
hues grew brighter and brighter, as if, in
unison with the historic era, tbrongh
which the threatened flag, the emblem of
a world's hope Is emerging into a nnr and
happier epoch.
The following paragraph follows the
above:
Inasmuch as we are the only "Black Re
publican Abolition sheet*' published in
South Carolina, aud are at considerable
expense in procuring paper and material,
we find it necessary to make a slight ad
vance on our price?. We will be obliged
to cbargo three cents for single numbers of
the "Kettle" and give ten copies for twen
ty-five cents. Nevertheless, to the citizens
of the "Palmetto Empire" we will furnish
the "Kettle" at tbe old prices. If any of
our friends in the North, where things are
plenty, take a fancy to send us a few bun
blea of paper, we would consider ourselves
under many obligations to tbe "horrid
Yankees."
Here is one of three obituary notices in
the little paper. It speaks sadly to tbe
heart of even a stranger:
Dibd?On the 7th of November at sea.
on board tbe "Ocean Queen " off Hilton
Head, S. C., of typhoid fever, James M.
Smith, ol company K, Capt. Vangorder, in
the 18th year of bis age. The deceased
was til when be embarked at Annapolis, and
continued to grow worse until, on the eve
of landing, bis spirit took its fiigb; for, we
have no doubt, a more peaceful shore than
this. We had not even a grave for bim on
shore, and his body was consigned to the
keeping of the deep blue sea. A few hours
later, we had conquered a foothold on the
land, but our young friend was in another
land, and bis young life, offered to bis
country, had gone up to the God who gave
and acccpted it back again.
Under the head of "Stirring Scenes," we
find this stirring paragraph. It makes one
feel good at this distance, to think that
the boys feel their mission so poetically, ns
well as politically:
Since the publication of onr last, we
have witnessed stirring scenes. We have
made a successful descent npon an enemy's
coast, after encountering one of the most
fearful storms that desolate the deep, fol
lowed by a successful landing, after five
hours naval fighting, against a well pre
pared antagonist, who chose his own posi
tion, and had taken all pains and added all
the applian'-es of science to render im
pregnable a position by nalufre only too
well adapted to /'facilitate, .hrf operations:
"We have witnessed the beginning of the
end." We have seen the" fortune of war
'forsake the pale standard of rebellion, and
we have seen the "Star Spangled Banner,"
wave its rainbow hues in the southern
skies, over the soil of dark, deceitful, per
jured South Carolina. We have seeu a
sight worth living for. We have seen
SUMPTBR AVKNQKD!
Mb. Cameron's report informs us that
the Government has no nae at present for
the whole volunteer force which it might
mine. Instead of 660,000 men we might
have a.million. He finds it necessary to
reduce rather than to nugmcnt our army.
And every man in it is there of his own free
will and choice. What a magnificent spec
tacle ! What & testimony of the strength
of the affection of our people for their
Government I
But already we hear the Sonth talking
of resorting to conscription. The Richmond
Enquirer discussing the weak points in the
military system of the South, says .
'?The only way to meet the north with
any prospect of success is to raise a regu
lar army by some means resembling the
conscription of all other nations in the
world except England and America.
Before the war began, all sane men be
lieved they (the north) would compromise
the political quarrel with the south. Few
thought it would last six months. The six
months have gone. The United States
hare endured defeat after defeat, made sac
rifice after sacrifice, and have closed an un -
successful campaign without the slightest
signs of an approach to reason. ** Not
less than five hundred thousand men are
enlisted for an indefinite period."
Wc suppose that we must have one hun
dred thousand, or perhaps two hundred
thousand more men than the rebels have.
Our soldiers are also enlisted for the war.
Some of the Southern regiments?a great
many of them from this State, wo know
not how many, are enlisted for only a year.
Gov. Pickens tells us that some of the
Sooth Carolinians enlisted for only twelve
months. At the end of the year many
whoBe time expire will not re-enlist unless
thoy are forced to do so. The Southern
army must, therefore, sufFer somewhat as
ours did when the three months volunteers
returned home, unless a conscription or
some other measure is adopted to keep up
the number.
Dr. B. J. Breckenridqe said in his
late masterly paper"on the civil war:
There "are conditions in which vast j
bodies , of staves may be considered a very |
powerful element in the military strength
of the Sonth ,* the chief of which consider
ations are, first, that the military; force of
the United. States should not bo able to - j
penetrate' the heart of the disloyal slave
region,?-and ttcondly, that after penetray.
ting that, region, the General Government,
should be weak enough to treat slave prop
erty, In the bands of rebels and traitors
as if it were sacred."

Tcxsoay, Dec. 10.
The Honse was opened with prayer by
the Rev. Mr. MitchelL
A communication was receeived from
the Senate announcing the passage of the
bill authorising the Secretary of the Com
monwealth to administer oaths, with a
slight amendment. The Senates amend
ment was concurred in.
Mr. Porter from the Committee on Fi
nance reported that It was inexpedient to
legislate upon the subject of publishing the
acts of Assembly in the newspapers.
Mr. Smith from the Committee on Courts
of Justice reported the'bill amending the
code.
Mr. Rdffnkb from the Committee on
Propositions and Grievances, reported a
bill releasing the State's interest in the
property of Eban Lipscomb of Preston
county."
Mr. West offered the following:
Hcsolv&J, That the Committee of Courts
of Justicc inquire into the expediency of j
reporting a bill declaring it puijury and
punishing it as such, for any person after i
having taken the oath to support the con- j
stitution of the United States, and the re- 1
organised government of Virginia, to give j
aid and comfort to the seolision cause.? j
Adopted.
Mr. Bhowk offered.***tallowing:; '
Whereas, The county of Kanawha' has
becu subjected to the ravages of war, and,^
the occupation of two hostile armies, and,'
worse than all. the highest and most de
structive flood ever known in that that sec
tion.
Retolvtd, That the Committee on Propo
sitions and Grievances inquire into the ex
pediency of releasing 'the loyal people of
thatcounty from the payment of the State
tax for 1861.
Adopted.
Mr. Wetzel ottered a resolution that
writs ot election bo immediately issued to
iill vacancies in this body.
The resolution was referred to' the Com
mittee on Courts of Justice.
The bill to: the relief of James i. Kuhn,
sheriff of Brooke county, who overpaid
$34 to Richmond was taken up.
Mr. West said he disliked very tnnch to
oppose tbe bill, but bis duty to the Com
mon wealth compelled him to do so. It
would be establishing a precedent, and
would open the way for the admission of
hundreds of claims of a similar character.
We must preserve the treasury.
Mr. Poster said it would yet cost the
State more to discuss the bill than it would
t<? pay the amount at once. He believud
the claim was just, and thought the House
ought to pay all such whenever satisfied of
theirjnstness.
Mr. Brown said that as far as the matter
of justice was concerned we might as well
undertake to pay tbe interest on the State
bonds which have been repudiated at Rich
mond.
Mr. Porter said be regarded the refosal
to pass this bill as a great hardship to the
Sheriff of Brooke county. Iiis commis
sions are small, and he only asked to be
credited with the amount named, in this
year's collections.
Mr. Boreman opposed tbe passago'of the
bill upon tbe grouud of its effect as a pre
cedent. As soon as we can get in condi
tion to pay tbeso claims, be would be wil
ling to do it, but in opr present condition
we cannot afford to establish a precedent
which would involve the payment of all
the jnst demauds upon tbe State.
The ayes and noes were called with the
vote resulted: Ayes, 7, naes 24. Tbe bill
was lost. * "?
Tbe bill requiring Clerks of Regimental
Courts to make out lists of fines for the
year 1860. collectable in 1801, together
with a copy of the Sheriff's receipts, for
said fines, and to transmit said lists and
copies to the Auditor of public accounts,
was taken up.
Mr. Logan enquired whether the amount
ot these fines would pay the expense incur
red in making out tbe required lists and
collecting the money.
Mr. Hooten was of the opinion that it
would pay. I
The bill was passed, by a unanimous |
rote.
The bill authorising a married woman to

To the Senate and Uoute of Delegatei: j
Grktlbmes There are a number of |
convicts confined in the county jails in the

not yet control of the penitentiary at Rich

arrangement authorizing the Executive to
have these convicts removed to the city of
Wheeling, and employed on some public
work. There is much- labor required in
repairing that part of the Cumberland

and was replied to briefly by Mr. Battelle.
Mr. Caldwell proposed to strike out
every thing iu the section after the word

proposition to take in these counties on
any conditions. He subsequently, how
ever, to allow the friends of the measure
to perfect the section, withdrew the mo

Mr. Willet spoke in oppositiou to the
amendment of Mr. Sinsel, and was suc

the same position.
The question was taken on the amend
