8 Id (At Oongrm of the United Stalin:
& Ai representatives of the people In the lcgislo-
tiro iHTtnevh of tholr Government, youhnvonssem
JF bled at n ttmo when tho stronitth and oxccllonco
ot our freo Institutions and the fitness of our cltt
S icns to cnjoy'popular rule havo been afralu miulc
1 manifest. A political contest Involving nioincn
C tousconsoquencet, fraught with fovcrish appro
36 henslon, and creating: oKKresslvcnoss so Intense
'$ at to approach bitterness nnd passion, has been
P wa(rcd throughout our land, and determined by
Sf the decree of froo and Independent surtroKO, with-
out disturbance of our tranquillity or the least
sign of weakness In our nutlonal structure.
K When vre consider those Incidents nnd con-
I template tho peaceful obodlcnce and manly sub
mission vv hlch huv o succeeded a heated clash of
political opinions, wo discover abundant cvldcnco
of a determination on tho part of our countrymen
to abldo by every vordlct of tho popular will, nnd
to be controlled at nil times by an abiding faith In
the agencies established for tho direction of tho
affairs of their 0 or eminent.
Thus our rcoplo exhibit a patriotic disposition
which entitles them to donmnd of thoso who un
dertake to make and executo tholr lawn such
faithful and unselfish sorvico In their behalf as
can only bo prompted by n serious appreciation of
tho trust and confidence which tho acceptance of
public duty Invites.
In obedience to a constitutional requirement, I
herein submit to tho Congress certain Informs-
tlon concerning national affairs, with tho soirees
Hon of such legislation as in my Judgment Is neo
eswry and expedient. To secure brevity nnd
avoid tiresome narration. I shall omit many do
talls concerning matters within Federal control,
which, though by no moans unimportant, are
more profitably discussed in departmental re
port. I shall also further curtail this communi
cation by omitting a mlnuto recital of many
minor Incidents connected with our foreign rela
tions which havo heretofore found a place In
executive messages, but are now contained In a
report of the Secretary of Stato, which Is herewith
submitted.
THE AIUIENIAN QUI8TI0S.
At the outset of a rcfcrcnco to tho more Im
portant matters affecting our relations with
foreign powers. It would afford me satisfaction If
I could assure tho Congress that tho disturbed
condition In Asiatic Turkey had during the past
year assumed a less hideous and bloody aspect,
and that either as a conscqucnco ot the awaken
ing of the Turkish Government to thodemnhds of
humane civilization, or as tho result of decisive
iiiw action on tho part of tho great nations having tho
I ! right by treaty to Interfere for the protection of
HS those exposed to the rago of mad blsrotry nnd
J Si cruel fanaticism, the shocking features of the
'f a situation had been mitigated. Instead, however.
' Si of welcoming a softened disposition or protective
; 3r Intervention, wo havo been afflicted by continued
i Wt and not unfrequent reports of tho wanton dc-
fes etructlon of homes and tho bloody butchery of
? Kp men, women and children, made martyrs to their
t 3j$ profession of Christian fait.
7 Hi While nono of our citizens In Turkoy have thus
; Mf far been killed or wounded, though often In the
'is midst of dreadful scenes of danger, their safety
yjl In the future is by no means assured. Our Gov-
55 ernment at homo and our Minister at Constanti-
JK, nople havo left nothing undone to protect our
m missionaries In Ottoman territory, who conitl-
4$ tuto nearly nil tho individuals residing there vv li i
,f W have n right to claim our protection on tho score
1 m of American citizenship. Our efforts In this dl-
J rectlon will not be relaxed; but the deep feeling
I 6S and sympathy that havo been aroused among
j lit our people ought not to so far blind their reason
1 (fit and judgment as to lend them to demand lin-
j; IS possible things. The outbreaks of blind fury
itffc which lead to murder and pillage In Turke)
I occur suddenly and without notice, nnd an at-
; 55, tempt on our part to force such a hostllo prcs-
, gif oncethcro ns might be effective for prevention

' THl' Ottoman Go eminent, but would b rewarded ns
fit an Interruption of their plans by tho great
tijSf nations who assert their exclusive right to Inter-
nYf vene In their own time nnd method for the sccur-
!r$ Uy of life and property In Turkey.

Ifi 1IIK CUIIAN INBURltECTION,
The Insurrection in Cuba still continues with
all its perplexities. It is dlfllcult to pcrecelvo
f that any progress lias thus far been made toward
W the pacification of tho bland or that tho bituatlou
' 7ll of affairs as depicted In my last annual message
(J has In the least Improved. If Spain still holds
Mm Havana and the seaports and all the considerable
K towns, the Insurgents still roam at will over at
iVJK least two-tklrdf ot tho Inland country. It the
vm deUrmtnation ef Bpatn to put down tho Insurreo-
TfW Uanieems but to etrengthen witb the lapse of
'fl time, and Lt evinoed by her unhesitating devotion"
lift ot largely Increased military and naval forces to
Jp the task, there Is much reason to believe that the
jJk mim-gents have gained In point of numbers and
mh charaoter and reaouroee, and are none the less (n-
IM, flexible In their resolve not to succumb, without
fbll tnettatSf aecnrlng the great object for which
& they took up arm. U Spain has cot ret re-

esUbJiihcd her authority, nelthor have the
Insurgents yet made good their title to be
regarded as an independent Stato. Indeed, as
the contest has gono on, tho pretence that civil
government exists on tho Island, except so far as
Spain is able to maintain It. has been practically
abandoned, Spain docs keep on foot such a gov
ernment, more or loss Imperfectly, in tho large
towns and their Immcdlnto suburbs. Hut, that
exception being made, the entire country is either
given over to anarchy or Is subject to tho military
occupation ot ono or tho other party. It Is re
ported, indeed, or rellablo authority that, at tho
demand of tho Commander in Chief of tho Insur
gent army, tho putatlvo Cuban Government has
now given up all attempt to exorcise Its func
tions, leaving that government confessedly (what
there Is tho best reason for supposing it always
to havo been in fact) a government merely on
paper.
THE WAn MAT BE MOLONGED INDRrlKITRLT.
Were tho Spanish armies ablo to moot their an
tagonists In tho open, or In pitched battle, prompt
and decisive results might bo looked for, and the
lmmcnso superiority of tho Spanish forces in
numbers, discipline and equipment could hardly
f.ril to tell greatly to their advantage. But they are
called upon to faco a foo that shuns general en
gagements, that can choose and docs choose Its
own gr und, that from tho nnturo of tho country
Is vlslblo or Invlslblo at pleasure, and that fights
only from nmbuscado nnd when nil tho advan
tages ot position and numbers aro on Its side. In
a country where all that Is indlspcmablo to Hfo
In tho wny of food, clothing nnd shelter Is bo
easily obtainable, especially by thoso born and
bred on ttio soil. It Is obvious that there Is hardly
a limit to tho tlmo during which hostilities of
this tort may bo prolonged, Monnwhllo, as tn all
cases of protracted civil strife, tho rasslons of
tho combatants grow mora nnd more inflamed
and excesses on both sides become more frequent
nnd more doplornblo. They aro also participated
In by bands ot marauders, who, now In tho name
of ono party nnd now In tho nnmo of tho othor,
as may best suit tho occaslun, harry tho country
at will nnd plunder Its wretched Inhabitants for
their own advnntnge. Such a condition of things
would Inovltably entail lmmcnso destruction of
property, oven If it wcro tho policy of both
parties to prevent It as far ns practicable. Hut
while such seemed to 1 tho original policy nf tho
Spanish Government, it has now apparently
abandoned It and Js acting ujon the snmo theory
as the Insurgents, namely, that the exigencies of
tho contest require tho wbolcsnlo annihilation of
property, that lt may not provo of use and ad
vantage to the enemy.
It Is to tho same end that In pursuanco of gen
eral orders Spanish garrlsonsnre now being with
drawn from plantations nnd the rural population
required to concentrate Itself in tho towns. Tho
sure result would tvem to bo that tho industrial
value of tho Island Is fast diminishing, and that
unlets there Is a speedy and radical change In
existing conditions It will soon dUapioar alto
gether. That valuo consists very largely, of
course. In Its capacity to produce sugnr a ca
pacity already much reduced bv tho interruptions
to tlllago which hnvo taken place during the last
two years. It is reliably asserted that Bhould
these Interruptions continue during the current
year and practically extend, as Is now threatened,
to tho entire sugar-producing territory of the
Island, so much tlmo and so much money will bo
required to restore tho land to its normal pro
ductiveness that lt Is extremely doubtful if capi
tal can bo Induced to even mako the attempt.
AUEUICAN lNTKltKSTS IX CUUA.
The spectaclo of tho utter ruin of an adjoining
country, by nnturo ono of tho most fertile nnd
charming on tho globe, would engage tho serious
attention of tho Govcrnincnt and people of the
United States In any circumstances. In point of
fact, they have a concern n Ith It which Is by no
means of a wholly sentimental or philanthropic
character. It lies so near to us as to be hardly
separated from our territory. Our actual pecu
niary Interest in it is second only to that of the
peoplo and Government of Spain. It Is reason
ably estimated that at least from 30,000,000 to
$50,000,000 of American capital are Invested 1c
plantations and In railroad, mining and other
business enterprises on the island. Tho volumo
of trade botwoen the United States and Cuba,
which In 1989 amounted to about f&l.OOO.OOO,
rose in 181)3 to about $103,000,000, and in 1891,
the year lieforo the present insurrection broke
out, amounted to nearly $96,000,000. Hesldcs
this largo pecuniary Btake In the fortunes of
Culn, tho United States llnds ItBclf Inextricably
Involved In the present contest In other wnys
both vexatious and costly.
Many Cubans rcsldo In this country and Indi
rectly promoto tho insurrection through tho
press, by public meetings, by the purchase nnd
shipment of arms, by the raising of funds, and
by other means, w hlch tho spirit of our Institu
tions nnd tho tenor of our laws do not lwnnlt to
be modo tho subject of criminal prosecutions.
Pomo of them, though Cubans nt heart and In
all their feelings and Interests, have taken
out papers ae naturalized citizens of the United
States n proceeding resorted to with n view to
possible protection by this Government, and not
unnaturally regarded with rnuoh Indignation by
ho country of their origin. Tho insurgents are
undoubtedly encouraged und Bupjwrted by tho
widespread sympathy tho people of this country
always nnd lntlnctlvely feel for every struggle
for better and freer government, and which, in
tho case of tho more adventurous and restless
element of our population, leads hi only too
many Instances to active and personal participa
tion In tho contest. Tho result Is that this Gov
ernment Is constantly called upon to protect
American citizens, to claim dainiges for Injuries
lo persons and property, now estimated nt many
millions of do'lars, and to oik explanations and
apilolesfor tho acts of Spanish ollki.tls, whoso
zeal for tho repression of rebellion sometimes
blinds them to tho Immunities belonging In tho
unoffending citizens of a friendly power. It fol
lows from the inme causos that tho United Slates
is compelled to actively police n long lino of sea
coast against unlawful expeditious, tho escape of
which tho utmost vigilance will not always sufllce
to prevent.
TUT. DKMANI) Foil J.NTEItVK.NTIO.S'.
Thcso Inevitable entanglements of tbo United
States with tho rclwlllon In Cuba, tho largo
American propsrty interests affected, and con
siderations of philanthropy nnd humanity In
general, havo led to a vulioiiiont demand In va
rious quartori for some sort of positive inter
vention on tho part nf tho United States. It was
at first proposed that belligerent rights should
ho accorded to tbo Insurgents a proportion no
longor urged bjrnusa untlnuly nnd In practical
operation o'oarly perilous and Injurious tu our
own IntcrostB. It lias Blnco benn nnd Is now
sometimes contended that t!io Independence of
tho Insurgents xhuiild bo recognized, lint Ira
lierfect and itttrlctid as tho Sp'inl.di govern
ment of tho Island may ho, no tuber c.lnts there
unless thoy.ll! of thu military ollleer in tiin
porary command of a particular district can bo
illgnlllcd as a species of government. It is now
also BUggestcd that tho United States should buy
tho island a uggcstlou possibly worthy of con
sideration If there were any c Ide"co of a desire
or willingness on the part nf Spain to entertain
such a proposal. It Is urged, finally, that, nil
othor methods falling, tho existing intcriuvino
strlfo in Cuba should ho terminated byonrln
tcncntlon, even at IhucoBt of a war botweeu the
United Stntes and Spain a war which Its ad
ocatos conlldcntly pinphesy could bo neither
larg'J In Its proportions nor doubtful In Its issue.
The correctntsi of this forecast need be neither
affirmed nor denied. The United Stulos has
nevertheless a character to milntaln as a nation,
which plainly dictates that right and not might
should bo tho rulo of its conduct. Further,
though tho United Mate Is not a nation to which
pe.icu Is i necessity, It Is in truth the most paclllo
of powers, nnd desires nothing so much as to live
in amity with nil tho world. Its own amnio und
diversified doumliH .mtlsfy all posslblo longings
for territory, preclude nil dreams of conquest, and
prcent any tinting of covetous ojes uKn neigh
boring regions, however nttinctlve. That our con
duct towaul Spain and her dominions bus consti
tuted no exception to this national disposition is
mado :nanlfe3t by tho courMi of our Government,
not only thus far during tho present insurrection,
but during tho ten years that followed tho rising
at Yuru In lfl9. No other great power, It nmy
safely bo said, under circumstances of similar
perplexity, would havo manifested the same re
straint and the ennlo patlont cnJurnnrn, It may
I uUo bo sal that thU jier.bteui uttliudo of tho
United States toward Spain in connection with
Cuba unquestionably evinces no slight rcspoot and
regard for Spain on the part tho American peo
plo. Thoy in truth do not forget her connection with
the discovery of the WesUirn Hemisphere, nor do
they underestimate the groat qualities of the
Spanish people, nor fall to fully recognize ihelr
splendid patriotism and their chivalrous dovotton
to the national honor. ... .L
Thoy vlow with wonder and admiration the
cheerful resolution with which vast bodies of
men are sent across thousands of miles of ocean,
and an enormous dobt accumulated, that tho
costly possession of the Gem of the Autlllos may
still hold Its place In tbo Spanish crown. And
yet neither the Government nor the pooplo of the
United Slates havo shut their eyes to tho court o
ot events in Cuba, or havo failed to roallzo the
existence of conceded grievances, which havo led
to the present revolt from the authority of Spain
grievances recognized by the Queen ltogent
and by tho Cortos. voiced by tbo most patrlollo
and enlightened of Spanish statesmen, without
regard topnrty, oud demonstrated by reforms
proposed by tho oxecutlvo and approved by tho
legislative branch ot tho Spanish Government.
It Is in tho assumed temper and disposition ot
tho Spanish Government to, remedy thcso
grievances, fortltlitl by Indications of Influential
public opinion In Spain, that this Government
has hoped to discover the most promising and ef
fects e means of composing tho present strlfo,
with honor and advantago to Sjmln and with tho
achievement ot all tho reasonable objects of tho
insurrection.

It would seem thnt If Spain should offer to
Cuba geuulno autonomy a measure of homo rule
which, whllo prescrx lng tho sovereignty of Spain,
would satisfy all rational requirements of hor
Spanish subjects there should bo no just reason
why tho pacification of tbo Island might not bo
effected on that basis. Such a result would ap
pear to be in the true interest uf all concerned. It
would at once stop the conflict which Is now con
suiiibig the resourcos of tho island nnd making It
worthless for whichever party may ultimately
prevail. It would keep lntoel tho possessions of
bimln without touching her honor, which will bo
lousultcd ralher than Impugned by tho ndequato
redress of admitted grievances. It would put tho
lirosiierity of tho island and tho fortunes of Its In
habitants within tholr own control, without sev
ering the natural nudanclcnt tics w hlch bind them
to tho mother country, and would yet onnblo
them to tost their capacity for solf government
under tho must favorable conditions, lt has bein
objected on the ono sldo that Spain should not
promtso uutonomy until her Insurgent subjects
lay down their arms; on the other side. Hint
promised uutoiininy, however liberal. Is tusulll
clem, because without asaurunco uf tho promlso
being fulfilled.
llul tho reasonableness of a requirement by
Spain, o." unconditional surrender on the part
of tho lnBiugcnl Cubans before their autonomy Is
conceded, is not altogether apparent. It Ignores
Important features or ho situation tlio stability
two years' duration has given to tho Insurrection;
the feasibility of its indellnlte prolongation In the
nnturo uf things, and us shown by past experi
ence; the utter und Imminent ruin of tho Island,
uuIodb tho present strlfo Is speedily composed;
above. nil, tho rank abuses winch nil parties
In Spain, all branches of her Government, nnd
all her leading public men concede to exist and
profess a desire to remove. Facing such circum
stances, to withhold the proffer of needed reforms
until tho parties demanding them put themselves
nt mercy by throw lng dow n their arms has tho
uppcuranco of neglecting tho gravest of perils
nnd Inviting suspicion as to tho sincerity of any
!rofcsscd willingness to grant reforms. The ob
ectlou on behalf of the insurgents that prom
sed reforms cannot bo relied upon must of
course be considered, though wo havo no right to
assume, and no reason for assuming, that any
thing Spain undertakes to do for tho relief of
Cuba will not tie dono according to both thu
spirit nnd tho letter of the undertaking.
Nevertheless, realizing that suspicions and pro
cautions on tho part of thu weaker of two com
batants aro alwass natural nnd not always un
justifiable being sluLcroly desirous In the inter
est of both, us well as un Its own account, that
tho Cuban problem should be sohrd with the
least possible delay It was Intimated by this
Government to tho Government of Spain some
months ago that, if a fatlsfactory measure of
home rulo were tendered the Cuban Insurgents,
and would bo accepted by them upon a guaranty
of Its execution, iho United States would en
dcaortollnil a way nut objectionable to Spain
of furnishing such guaranty. Whllo no definite
response to this intimation has jet been received
from tho Spanish Government, lt Is believed to
bu not altogether unwelcome, whllo. as already
suggested, no reason is perceived w liy lt should
not be approved by the Insurgents. Neither
party can fall to rvo the lraiwrtanco of early no
tion, and both must realize that to prolong tho
pre-ent Btato of things for even a snort period
will add enormously to the time nnd labor nnd
expenditure ntcessnry to bring about tho Indus
trial recuperation of tho I'land. It is therefore
fervently hojwd on all grounds that enrnest ef
forts for htallng tho breach between Spain nnd
the Insurgent Cubans, uiwn tho lines above indi
cated, luur be at once Inaugurated and pushed to
an Immediate and successful Issue. The friendly
utllcesof tho United States, either In tho manner
above outlined or In any other way consistent
with our Constitution and laws, will always bo
at tho disposal ot either party.
Tlir.HE MAT BE A LIMIT TO OUR PATIENCE.
Whatover circumstances may arise, our policy
and our interests would constrain us to object tn
tbo acquisition of the island or an interference"
with Its control br any other power.
It should bo nducd that It cannot be reasonably
assumed that tho hitherto evpoetmit attitude nf
the United Slates will lo Indefinitely maintained.
Wtulu we aru anxious to accord all duo respect
to the sovereignty of Spain, we uiuuut slew the
pending court. ct in nil its features and properly
nppnhuul our Inevitably close rtlations to It
and its possible results without considering that

mch an unusual and unpreetdcnlcd condition
ns will fix a limit to our patient waiting for
Spain tu end tho contest, either alone nnd in her
own way, or nilh our friendly co-nt'nitlon.
When the Inability of Spain to ileal sin eessfully
with the Insurrection hashecome manifest, nnd it
is demonstrated that her sos-uruUiity Is extinct In
Cuba for all purposes of Its rightful existence,
nnd sshena hupo. ess struggle fur its re-establish-ment
has degenerated into u strife which means
nothing more llinn the u-elessRairlllio of human
life and the utter destruction nf the very subject
matter of tho conflict, a situation ill Ik pre

s hlch we can hardly hcsituto to recognize und

should make them depend upon the prolsu condi

The organized militia numbers 112,b70 men.
Tliu appropriations fur Its -upportby tho several
States approximate $2,800,000 annually, and
$100,000 is contributed by tho Goncral Govern
ment. Investigation shows there troops to bo
Uiuully well drilled and Inspired with much mili
tary interest, but In many Instances they lire so
detlclentln proper arms and equipment that a
sudden call to nctlvo duty would find them In
adequately prepared for field service. I therefore
recumtnend that prompt measures bo taken to
remedy this condition, und that every encourage
ment bo given lo this deserving hotly of untmld
nnd voluntary citizen soldiers, upon whoso assist
ants wo must largely rely in time of trouble.
During the past jcar Lipid progress has been
made toward tho completion of tho sehemo
adopted for tho erection and armament of fortifi
cations along our sencoast, whllo equal progress
has been made In providing tho material for 6ub
mnrino defence In connection with these works.
lt Is peculiarly gratifying nt this time to nolo
the great ndvanco that has been mode in this Im
portant undertaking since tho date of my annual
message to tho Fifty-third Congress nt tho open
ing of Its second sosslon. In December, 1S93. At
that tlmo I informed tho Congress of the np
proachlng completion of nlno 12-Inch, twenty 10
Inch, and thirty-four 8-luch hlgh-puwer steel
guns, and seventy-llvu 12-Iuch rifles! mortars.
This total then seemed Insignificant when com
pared with the great work remaining to Iw done.
Yet It was none the less a source of satisfaction
to every citizen when ho reflected that It repre
sented tho Urst Installment ut the new ordunnco
of American design and American manufacture,
and demonstrated uur ability to rupply from our
own resources guns of unexcelled power and
accuracy.
At that date, however, there were practically
no carriages upon which to mount tlieso guns,
and only 31 emplacements for guns and 04 for
mortars. Nor were all these emplacements In
condition to receive their urmament. Only one
high-power gun was at that tlmo in position for
the defenco of the entire coast.
8Inco that tlmo the number of guns actually
cuiiipletesl has been Increased to a total of twenty
one 12-lnch. tlfu-Mx 10-tnch. sixty-one 8-inch
high-power breech-loading sticl guns, ten rapid
fire guns, nnd eighty 12-lnch rifled mortars. In
addition there are in process of construction ono
10-liich typo gun. fifty 12 inch. tlft)-six 10-inch,
twenty-seven 8-inch high-power guns, and sixty
six 12-lnch rilled mortars: In nil, four hundred
nnd twcnty-olght guns nnd mortars.
During iho same jenr, immediately preceding
the message referred to. the Urst mudcru gun car
riage h id lieen completed nnd el- en more were
In process of construction. All but one were of
thcno!wlhappeur!ng.t)pc. 'i'bee, howover. were
not such as to secure ni-ccssnr) euver for the
artillery gunners against the Intense tiro of
modem machine rapid tire nnd high-power guns.
Tho inventive genius of ordnance and civilian
experts has tieen taxed in designing carriages
that would obviate this fault, resulting. It Is be
lieved, In tho solution uf this dilllcult problem.
Since 1!3 the number of gun currlagee con
structed ur building has been ra sed to n total of
129, of which 90 are on the disappearing princi
ple, and the number uf mortar carriages to 152.
while the 05 emplacements which were provided
for prior tu that time have been increased to 2e0
built and building.
This unproved situation is largely due to the
recent generous res;one nf Congress to the
resiimineiiilatlnusnf tin War Id partment,
I bus we ah ill sunn hive complcto about one
flflh of the comprehensive system, tlu tlrst step
In which was tiottsl in my message to tho Con-grcs-
of December 4, 1-93.
When it is uuder-toiHl that n masonry em

Inn)) modern high power gun, but also In every
lsirticulur serves the purpo-e and takes the place
uf thu fort uf former da) s, the Importance of the
work mcumpHilicd 1- le Iter comprehended.
In thohoH) thai the work will bo presented
with no less vigor lu the future, tho Secretary of
War has submitted an e-tlmale by whlcli.it
allow est, tin re will tie provided und either built
or bulidli g b) the end uf the next tl'cal year such

pruH.s't that the entire wnrk will bosubstantlally

decree uf rr curity.
'I lie experience nnd results nf tho past jear
denimilrate tliut with n continuation uf present
careful methods tho cost if the remaining work
will bu much less than the original estimate.
Wu should alw.i) keep in mind that of all
forms of military preiaratlun coast defence
alone is essentially pacltic iu ils nature. While It
gives the sen"e nf ncurity duo tu a consciousness
nf strength. It is neither tlm purpose nor tho if-fe-ct

THE POSTAL SERVICE.

Pueillc Itaihoud fur transportation and credited
on Its dobt tu Ihu Guverumunt. There was an
increase of receipts over tho previous year of $3,
510,080.21, or 7.1 per cent., and unlncreaso of ex

The itellclt wns $1,0,0,050.10 loss than thnt uf
the preceding J oar. The chief expenditures of
tbo postal service are regulated by law and are
not In the control Pftho Postmaster-General. All

The year's report shows lnrgcextcntlons of both
star route service and rallvva) mall service, with
Increased postal facilities. Much higher accuracy
In handling malls has also been reached, as ap
pears by tho decroaso nf errors In the Hallway
Mail Servlco and the reduction of mall matter rc

Tho deficit for tho last) ear, although muchlcss

phasizes the uooesslty for legislation incorrect

thn deficiency is mainly attributable. The trans

nrst-elass matter was 03 cents
From each pound or second class b-j milts
(Of the BtH.-onds.lass 5J,3Ps,20 was
county-free matter )
From eaeh pound tr third cliws 13.1 cents
From each iKiund of fuurtli-elast 13,0 cents
Tho growth tn vvoight of second-class matter
has been from 299,000.000 pounds In 1891 to
312,000.000 tn 1895, and to almost 310,000.000
in 1890. nnd it is quite evident this Increasing
draw back Is far outstripping any possible grow th
of postnl revenues.
Our mall servlco should of course be such as to
meet Iho wants and cv en the conveniences of our
people, at a direct charge upon them so llaht
as perhaps to excludu thu Idea of our Post Olllco
Department being a money-making concern; but
tn the face of a constantly recurring deficiency in
its revenues, and III view of tho fact that we
supply the tost mall tervlco in tho world, it seems
to me it Is quite lime to correct tho abuses that
swell enormously oir annual deficit. If wo enti
ced e tbo public follcy of earning weekly news
papers frto in the county of publica
tion, and even tho policy of currying
ot less than one-tenth of their cost
other bona lido new simpers nnd periodicals,
there can lio no excuse for subjecting the
servlco to the further lmmcnso and Increasing
los Involved In carrying at the nominal rntoof
1 cent a jiound tho serial libraries, sometimes In
cluding trashy nnd even harmful literature, and
other matter, which, undir the loose interpret
tatiun nf a louso statute, has been gradually
given second-class iales, thus absorbing all
profitable retuins derived from first-class mat
ter, which pays three or four times more thnn
Its cost, and producing a large annual los to bo
paid b) general tuxaiiun. If such sccnnd-class
matter paid merely thu cost of Its handling our
deficit would di-upp.tr and a turpi n result
which micht be u-cd tn give the wople still
better mall facilities or i hrajicr rates ot letter
postage l recommend that legislation lc at
onceennctid to correct these abuses and Intro
duce better business ideas in the regulation of
our postal rates.

Experience and ob-erv.itlnn have demonstrated
that certain improvements in thu organization uf
tho Post Olllco Department must bo secured be
fore we can gnln the full benefit of the Immense
sums expended In us administration. This in
volves the following reforms, which I curacstly
recommend:
There should b" a small addition to tho existing
Inspectur service, to be cmplnved In the supervis
ion of the earner force, which now numbers
13,0110 men, nnd performs its servlco practically
without the surveillance exercised over all other
branches of the postal or public service. Of
course such a lack uf sti;icrvision nnl freedom
f roui w hulc'oiuo disciplinary restraints must In
ev Itably lend to lnijicrtcct service. There should
also be appointed n few insisx-lors who t ould ns
tist the central office in necessary Investigation
concerning inattirs of Hst olllco leases, jmst
OSHcc sites, allowances for rent, fuel and lights,
and In orgnnlmg nnd securing tho best remits
from the work uf tho 14,000 cleiKS nuvvcuiplu)e'd
In tint und second class ulllces.
I am convinced thai the small expenso attend
ing the inauguration of these reforms would ne
