CONGRESS AT WORK
LAST SESSION OF THE PRESENT
BODY OPENS IN PRESENCE
OF MANY VISITORS.
president Sends Long List of Ap­
pointments to the Senate and Sev­
eral Resolutions of Inquiry Are In­
troduced Regarding the Discharge of
Colored Soldiers of the Twenty-
fifth Infantry.
Washington, Dec. 4.—The Fifty
tiinth congress began its last session
fat noon. It took the senate fifteen
Jnlnutes to arrange its preliminaries
land the house an hour. The senate
feceived from President Roosevelt a
long list of appointments for its con
firmation, and in an executive session
of nineteen minutes decided that as
the nominations had been received be
fore the body had been organized for
tnally to make no confirmations until
the president's annual message had
t)een received and the session fairly
started.
Senators Penrose of Pennsylvania
and Foraker of Ohio came forward
with resolutions of inquiry regarding
the discharge of the negro troops of
the Twenty-fifth infantry. One was
addressed to the president and the oth
er to the secretary of war. After the
iripple of surprise had passed and Vice
President Fairbanks had suggested
that it was unusual to transact any
business until the president's message
had been received, the resolutions
'•'went over" by unanimous consent.
Senator Dupont of Delaware took the
tjath of office.
The opening of the two houses was
Witnessed by an animated throng,
iwhich filled the galleries to their ca
pacity. Hundreds went away disap
pointed in not gaining admission to
Witness the session of either senate or
house.
Not in years has a larger number of
taembers-elect of the lower house of
congress presented themselves at the
speaker's desk to take the oath of of
fice. Death has been unusually active
among the membership during the
closing days of the last session and
the beginning of the present and Chap
tain C'ouden feelingly called the atten
tion of the body to the work of the
grim reaper during the months since
adjournment.
Mann Appointed to Succeed Hitt.
Speaker Cannon appointed Repre
sentative James R. Mann of Illinois as
a member of the board of regents of
the Smithsonian Institute, vice Robert
ft. Hitt of Illinois, deceased.
The galleries of the house were
Crowded at an early hour. The ab
sence of flowers from the desks of the
members was much commented on,
but the order of the speaker prohibit
ing the floral display was generally
commended for its good sense. A
similar rule was made in the senate
two years ago.
The routine work of the house inci
dent to the opening day was quickly
dispatched, the roll call showing near
ly 300 members present.
Representative Bourke Cockran of
New York, who recently married Miss
Ide, was the subject of hearty laugh
ter when his personal request that he
be permitted to absent himself for an
Indefinite period on account of busi
ness was laid before the house by the
speaker.
After the appointment of the usual
committee to wait upon the president
and inform him that the house was
organized and ready to receive any
communication he might desire to
make of interest to the public service,
the house adjourned out of respect to
the memory of the deceased members.
No bills were introduced in the sen
ate. In the house there was 38 public
measures and 350 of a private charac
ter.

LIABILITIES OF $700,000.
Three McDonough County (III.) Banks
Close Their Doors.
Peoria, 111., Dec. 1.—Three banking
Institutions in McDonough county,
conducted by C. V. Chandler of Ma
comb. have been closed. The banks
tire:
The Bank of Macomb, conducted by
C. V. Chandler & Co., having deposits
cf $450,000 and capitalized at $50,000
the Chandler & Imes bank at Colches
ter. capitalized at $25,000, having de
posits of $200,000, and the Chandler &
Smith bank of Bardolph, capitalized
at $25,000, with $60,000 in deposits.
The money has been invested in
McDonough county real estate. The
immediate cause of the suspension is
given \s a lack of ready cash. The
Macomb bank was responsible for the
payment of the bonds of the Macomb
and Western Illinois Electric railway
and when the bondholders demanded
their money they badly embarrassed
the three banks.
The liabilities are upwards of $700,
000.
ELEVEN PULAJANES KILLED.

Manila, Dec. 1.*—A force of con

son and nine of the band were wound
fid. Chief Pablo himself escaped, but
his wife and daughter tvere captured.
Clothing, arms and papers found were
destroyed, together with the camp.
The capture of Chief Pablo is consid
ered the question of only a few days.
There is now only one other chief at
large and plans have been arranged
to capture or kill him. Governor Curry
of Samav wires that the breaking up
of Chief Pablo's band signalizes the
death knell of Pulajanism in the isl
and.
TEN DEAD. MANY HURT
FATAL FIRE IN CROWDED SALVA­
TION ARMY LODGINGHOUSE
AT ST. LOUIS.
St. Louis, Nov. 29.—The Lighthouse
hotel, a three story structure on the
northwest corner of Ninth and Market
streets, utilized as a Salvation Army
barracks, was damaged by fire early
in the day when probably 500 home
less men were lodged within it.
Ten lost their lives and probably
thirty-five were injured, about half
that number being seriously injured,
some not being expected to live. Eight
were burned to death and two died
from injuries received from jumping
from upper windows. Two others of
those who jumped are lying uncon
scious at the city hospital and are iiol
expected to recover.
The fire started on the third floor
and swept through the whole building
rapidly. The men fought at windows
to secure lifelines and slide to the
street, but so great was the frenzy
with which the lines were seized and
held that they were of no avail and
those who could not escape by the
stairway leaped from the windows. A
large number of those who jumped
were caught in nets, but many jumped
before the nets were stretched and
were injured. There was but one
stairway and the panic stricken men
surged down this stairway to the
street only to find the door locked. A
jam resulted and probably a great loss
of life would have occurred had not
firemen promptly burst the door open,
permitting the frenzied men to pour
out into the street.
PURCHASED FROM VANDERBILT.
Big Block of Chesapeake and Ohio

New York, Dec. 3.—Kuhn, Loeb &

the stock was purchased for the Van
derbilt interests, which now control
a considerable amount of Chesapeake
and Ohio stock.
COAL FAMINE IN NEVADA.

MILLIONS OF RUSSIANS tN THE
VOLGA DISTRICT IN NEED
OF ASSISTANCE.
Crops in Seven Provinces Are a Total
Failure and in Twenty Others the
Harvests Are Very Poor—Estimated
That Seventy-five Million Dollars
Will Be Needed to Relieve the
St. Petersburg. Dec. 3.—Princes
Lvoff and Orbeliani, the representa
tives of the Moscow zemstvo famine
relief organization, who have just re
turned from the stricken districts,
have furnished the Associated Press
With the following facts regarding the
conditions in the famine provinces:
The crops in the seven provinces
of Samara, Saratov, Sembirslc, Kazan,
Penza, Tambov and Ufa were practi
cally total failures. In twenty prov
inces the harvests were very poor.
About 20,000,000 people will need as
sistance "for from four to ten months
to stave off starvation until the new
crops are available. Though affecting
18,000,000 persons the destitution is
far less intense than it was in 1S91.
In some regions the inhabitants have
been suffering from starvation for ten
years, passible crops having been gath
ered in only two of the ten years.
Prince Lvoff believes the government
estimate of $50,000,000 for famine re
lief is inadequate. The Moscow zemst
vo relief organization calculates that
$75,000,000 and possibly more will be
necessary.
Though the conditions in the famine
regions are now distressing far worse
may be expected in January. The
zemstvo organization funds will then
be exhausted and the relief commit
tees will be compelled to cease their
efforts for the starving peasants. Prince
Lvoff complained that the local offi
cials, for political reasons, are inter
fering with the establishment of soup
kitchens and the rendering of medical
assistance.
He reported cases where petty func
tionaries prohibited assistance being
given to famine sufferers. Epidemics
of hunger, typhus and scurvy, which
usually began in February, already
have appeared in three provinces—
Tulla, Kazan and Samara.

HEINZE'S GENEROSITY.
Donates $100,000 to Depositors of De
funct Bank.
Butte, Mont., Dec. 1.—Receiver Wil
son of the wrecked Aetna bank of
Butte has announced that he received
a check from Augustus Heinze for
$100,000.
Mr. Heinze formerly was president
of the bank, but withdrew in 1903.
Believing, however, that many depos
itors had not known of his withdrawal,
although it was widely advertised at
the time, and that through confidence
in his reputation many of his friends
may have lost their money, Mr. Heinze
says in his letter to Mr. Wilson he
contributes $100,000 towards the
bank's assets and forwards his check
for that amount.
The contribution should increase
the bank's assets 50 per cent.

Stab in Leg Kills Butcher.
Charles Anderson met with an acci
dent near Dazey, which resulted in his
death at Platou's hospital at Valley
City. Anderson was employed on the
farm of Sam Mason and went to Mott
Mason's farm to assist with the fall
butchering. While he was sticking a
pig his knife slipped and the blade
gashed his leg. A doctor was sum
moned who tied the severed article.
However it kept breaking and the man
was taken to Valley City, the wound
bleeding the entire distance of twen
ty miles. All possible assistance was
given at the hospital, but he died.
Asphyxiated in His Shack.
Samuel Halback was found dead in
his bed in a shack on his homestead
near Turtle Lake, having been asphyx

dicated that the man had gone to bed
after filling his stove with lignite and!
closing the shack tight. There was a
poor draft in the chimney, and a
change in the wind during the night
sent the gas from the coal back into
the room, suffocating the man as he I
slept. To make death certain, the I
stove exploded, filling the air with
the noxious vapor. I
Car Famine.
The state is suffering just at pres-l
