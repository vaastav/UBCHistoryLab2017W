Our space ia largely taken up with Ike
President's Message this morning. The
document was sent into Congress at noon
yesterday and promptly transmitted by
telegraph to this and other points. It will
be lound in cxtenso on our third page.
No one would pick tho President out
lor a professional writer of state papers.
Thero will be no suspicion that any pen
save his own was employed In getting up
the message sent into Congress yesterday
It bears evidence ol emenation lrom an
unpracticed writer?from ono to whom
composition is an unlamiliar and probably
an uncongenial employment. Nevertheless
the message is an easily understood
document. It is a business paper all the
way through. Its chief feature is its opening
discourse on the finances. The views
ol last spring are renewed and reinforced
with considerable warmth. In fact tho
President manifests a zeal that almost
borders on Impatienco and apprehension
in regard to specie payments. He is a long
wry lurther on in that direction than he
oidu Oiia limi* a trnnr n<rn Tf tea a l?ia
messago of December, 1878, that misled
Congress as to what he would do with
Hie inflation bill, and that stultified such
Republican leaders as Morton nod
bonis before the country. The marvelous
Jones?the specie Benator from
Ntvada?who is credited with the inspiration
ol the April veto?is still a
potent spell on the Presidential mind. The
present bold re affirmation of the views
then expressed leaves no hopo whatever
that Mr. Grant, who Mrs. Grunt
say9 is a very "stubborn man," will
change. Henceforward, therefore, we
may count upon his active influence
in favor ol the repeal of the
fj?gal tender act and a resumption of
specie payments. And in his efforts to this
end the country will gradually acquiesce.
We say gradually, for, as wo remarked
yesterday, there is going to be nothing
done ol a definite character iu regard to
the finances either by this or the next
Congress. Tho Republicans will let the
n.,UIn tl.n lw,nna r.f
ouiyui.1 ??.. .u .uv " '1'^" ?" *?iiic.jus
their losses in tlio late elections, and the
Democracy will avoid it lor fear ol endangering
their success. And thus the
business will bo laid on tho table until
alter the Presidential election of 1878.
Aa for tho other topics treated upon in
the Message they aro not ol sufficient
moment to call for special comment. The
late Louisiana imbroglio is alluded to and
tho action ol the government explained
and defended in regard to the attempted
usurpation. The President very proper
ly refers the whole matter to Congress,
and reminds members that they failed to
do their duly in the premises at the last
session He also gives a short history ol
the Atkansas troubles, and turns over
that Stale along with Louisiana to the
atleation ol Congress. For further particulars
in regard to tho contents ol the
Message wo refer readers to the document
itself.
The Pittsburgh Lockout.
The Pittsburgh papers of yesterday
give tho proceedings of the final conference
that took place Saturday afternoon
between the iron manufacturers and
puddlers. There was some warmth ol
feeling manllested in tho discussion, but
u9 a general thing tho language used was
that of moderation. Both sides evinced
firmness of purpose and 11 the puddlers
have any intention of an ultimate compromise
their spokesman did not declare
it In ilie mrclini' The QazttU con
jeclures that the lockout will throw
about 15,000 parsons out o( employment,
including puddlers, coal miners, and
laborers. That paper also Bays that it
has been asserted that the treasury ol the
1'uddlers Union contains $100,000, to be
used in just euch an emergency as the
present lockout, but on the other
hand it is alleged that the members have
been assessed one dollar a week each to
support the strikers at Troy, Now York,
and that the funds on hand are light.
According to the card now in force the
puddlers were getting $0 per ton, and
were making Ave heats per day, equal say
to one and one-eighth ton, or $0 75 per
day. Oat of this they paid their helpers
$2 23, leaving them $1 00. At the proposed
reduction they would havo earned
|3 70 net, and their helpers $1 85.
Our Pittsburgh dispatch this morning
ahows that the lock-out has commenced In
dead earnest. Out of 800 puddling furnaces
in that city and vicinity but 73 arc
lit up, and these only temporarily. Zut's
Mill shut down on Saturday evening and
discharged 300 hands. This was dono Irrespective
ol compromise, as tho proprietors
allege that even at the reduction
there is no inducement to run. It costs
(25,000 a year in interest, insurance, Ac.,
for this mill to stand idle. And yet it has
cloaed rather than run at present prices
for Its product.
Tho Uautte understands that at some
of the mills there is a six months supply
ol "muck" iron. It alsounderstands that
the orders on hand among tho manufacturers
do not amount to much, and that
the; can therefore allord to go slow until
prospects improva. Owing to tho present
difficulty a good deal of money will
retire from circulation. It is estimated
that the mills at Pittsburgh and vicinity
circulate about (150,000 per day. The
expense of tho American Iron Works,
(Jones & L/luohliks) arc alone $20,000
per day. A certain amount of this money
will of course now lie dormant and thereby
cause no little distress.
During the conference on Saturday Mr.
B*nnktt stated that all the mills In
Philadelphia, with one exception, hive
stopped. Alio that tho Troy mills are all
standing [die.

lost ono killed and two wounded. The
attack was made lor tbc purpose ol reinstating
Uroaby, Sheriff, who was militated
to resign because be had not given any
bond. The negroes in the country are
reported to be burning the dwelling and
gin houses.
VicMuno, December 7. ? Engagements
took place this morning between
the whites and negroes on the various
routes leading into the city. The negroes
wero repulsed and routed at all points,
with the loss ol 18 or 20 killed, and the
same number -wounded. Thirty or forty
prisoners wero captured and lodged in
jail. One white man named Oliver
ilrown, ot Haider's lilutr, was killed, l'oliccman
Burton wounded, and Geo.
Batchelor accidentally shot through the
foot. The citizens arc still under arms,
and the roads are picketed. The excitement
is subsiding. In town the negroes
took no part ia Ibc difficulty whatever.
PARTICULARS OP THE ENGAGEMENT.
YiCKsnuno, December 7 ?There has
been ior some time past trouble brewing
between the Tax-payers' Association and
the citizens and the county ofllcl'ils. The
Sheriff was acting without a legal bond,
and the Board ol Supervisors refused to
order a new one, though the time for paying
taxes had arrived. Two or thrco other
officials were under indictment for forgery
and embezzlement, and the citizens,
despairing of any relief from partisan
courts, last Wednesday held a meeting
and in a body proceeded to the Court
llouse to demand the resignation ot the
Sheriff, Chancery Clerk, Treasurer and
Coroner. All lied except Sherill Crosby,
a negro, and he signed his resignation.
On Saturday a card appeared on the
streets, bearing Crosby's signature, calling
on all the Hepublican citizens ol Warren
county, white and black to come to
his aid and support him in his
position. Crosby publicly aud through
the papers denied the authorship
of the card. Yet this morning
armed bodies of negroes appeared advancing
on the city from six ditlercnt
roads. The alarm was sounded about
9 o4clock and the citizens gathered enmass
and armed immediately and advanced
to meet the negroes on Baldwin's
Ferry road. The negroes were met juBt
outside the city, near Trone street, about
200 strong. The commander ol the citizens
warned the negros to disperse, but
they relused, and immediately firing commenced
lrotn both sides. The negroes
retreated about a mile and again made a
stand in an old breast works and a house,
but were soon routed. The loss in this
engagement was one citizen, Oliver
Brown, killed, and about 12 or 15 negroes
were killed, several wounded and about
20 wero taken prisoners. On Hall's Kerry
road about 250 negroes wero fouud and
routed atter a short engagement in which
several of tho negroes wero killed and
wounded. Andrew Owens, tho negro
who commanded the negroes on Baldwin's
Ferry[road, was captured and committed
to jail. .jVjjiaj
In an interview with a lkrald reporter
Owens said that he was ordered by Sheritf
Crcabytocomo to the city today with
all the armed men he could get together.
Alexander Stackhouee, from Uewton,
one ol the capturcd negroes, says the order
for nil the negroes to come to Vicksburg
this morning was read iu church
Sunday. Crosby, who is under guard at
the Court House, denies that he gave such
orders.
It is reported this evening that the negroes
arc committing depreJationB in the
country. Tho intense excitement that
prevailed this morning has subsided to a
great degree, yet many citizens are under
arms and all the roads are picketed.
At a public meeting this evening the
following was adopted:
Rewind, That whilo we are fully satisfied
that Peter CroBby has caused armed
negroes to march on the city, and should
thereforo be hold mainly responsible for
all the blood that has been shed, we recommend
all good citizens to abstain
from inliictiog any personal violence upon
him, and that we use still further eflorts
to have him removed from olHec in some
legal manner;
LATER.
The evidenco just received renders it
absolutely ccrtain that Qov. Ames and his
Attorney General George ? Harris incited
and advised invasion ol this city by
the negroes to-day. This evidence has
been laid before the ablest lawyers of tho
city with a view to arresting and bringing
these parlies to this city lor trial.

NEW ORLEANS.
New Orleans, December 7. ?The
Vicksburg reports in circulation last nigbt
that a large body of armed negroes were
on their way to the city to take possession
ol the court house, were confirmed this
morniog at nine o'clock, when the alarm
bells were rung to alarm the citizens.
The business bouses ol all kinds are closed
and the whites, under arms, are marching
out on the various roads to meet the
enemy. The court house is in the possession
ol the whites and the negro
sheriff a prisoner. Great excitement prevails.
TUB CITY ATTORNEYSHIP.
City Attorney Lacy resigned a (e?
days ago and suggested the necessity ol at
once filling the vacancy. The City Council
accordingly elected B. P. Jonas City
Attorney. When bo went to take possession
ot bis office this morning be found
one ol II r. Lacy's assistants in possession,
with a commission Irom Oov. Kellogg
appointing him, Walsh, City Attorney,
via Lacy resigned. The city administrators
met, and alter examining the law
became satisfied they bad power to elect
a cily Attorney, and that Walsh was an
interloper. They went to the cily Attorney's
office and requested Walsh to
turn it over,to Jonas, which be declined
to do, but as the administrators were
there to put him out, he finally turned
over the kcyB, books and papers to Mayor
Leeds, and withdrew under protest, stating
that he would contest the matter before
tbe courts.
Tbo city charter provides that the new
Council at the first regular meeting shall
elect the City Attorney. This provision
of the law was complied with. It is
stated that Jonas was elected in less than
ten minutes after Lacey'a resignation was
read by Council. Therefore, when Walsh
waB appointed there was no vacancy.
The Council has power to dismiss tho City
Attorney. They will adjourn from day
to day and dismiss all appointees of the
Governor and employ counsel to attend
to the citys legal business. The council
also has power to regulate the salary of
tho City Attorney. It they can't get rid
of Walsh any other way they propose to
reduce the salary to one hunred dollars
per annum.
The administrators are determined not
to have Walsh or any other Kellogg appointee
in the City Hall.
With a quorum iu both Houses the Returning
iBoard will then refer the contested
parishes to the Legislature, and
that body will throw out the Conservatives
and call upon the President lor
troops to sustain them. Prominent Conservatives
assert that this is tbe radical
programme.
SLOW PilOORBSP.
The Returning Board is getting along
slowly. Returns from about twenty Parishes
"were contested and laid aside; about
fifteen of them gave Conservative majorities.
It is now believed the Board will
promulgate the returns from other Parishes
giving a Republican majority iu the
Legislature.
