? The signing of the treaty of peace
between the United States and Spain
was completed last Saturday evening
at 8.20 o'clock. The treaty consists
of seventeeu articles, the main points
of which have already been published.
After the signing of the treaty, each
member of the commission shook
hands with all of his antagonists, and
then all departed from the chamber.
Some of the American commissioners
purchased handsome pens with which
to sign the treaty, intending to keep
them as souvenirs. The Spanish com
missioners used sued pens as Happened
to be lying on the table.
? The government, through the
Cbickamauga Park commission, has
secured the deeds of 16 acres on Point
Lookout, the highest point in the
Chickamauga region and overlooking
seven states and all the battlefield adjacent
to the park. During the siege
of Cbickamauga, this point was an important
Confederate position, occupied
by a battery. The park commissioners
will at once replace the battery m the
position it occupied during the war,
and will erect historical tablets at important
poiuts. It will be left to the
several states whose troops were engaged
at this point to erect monuments
and memorial tablets.
? The Kansas City Journal thus
quotes the letter of a soldier in Honolulu
to his friends : "The New York
regiment here want to go home very
bad. They are dying off very fast,
there being a funeral from their camp
almost every day. It is mostly their
own fault, as they won't take care of
themselves; but drink and carouse
around all the time. The natives
make a kind of beer called 'suiake.'
If a white man driuks it, it will make
him crazy and probably kill him. One
of our soldiers went to town yesicmaj
and draok some of this 'sroake.' It
didu'tdo a tbiug to him but make bim
crazy. They bad to keep him iu irons
most of the night. He is all right today
; but walks around with a guard
over bim all the time."
? The National Cycling Racing association
was organized at a meeting of
track owners and mauagers iu NewYork
last Thursday. It is tbe aim ol
the association to control bicycle racing,
professional and amateur, in all ol
the states east of the Mississippi river,
except Louisiana. An alliance will be
made with tbe Western Cycling association
and California association oi
Cycling clubs, and the Southern Cycling
association. These officers were
elected : President, C. A. Johnson, of
Buffalo; vice preaideut, O. D. Bloemck,

? General Miles expects to appear
before the house military committee
in a few days to set out personally the
reasons why he thinks the army bill
should be passed. The most urgeut is
the fact that immediately upon the
formal announcement of peace between
the United States and Spain, the United
States army may be suddenly reduced
almost a third, and at a time when the
need for troops for garrison purposes
is still pressing. This statement does
not apply to volunteer troops. As
stated by the president iu his message,
they, having enlisted for the war, must
all be discharged. But when the war
department, acliug uuder the authority
conferred by congress at the last
session, sought to recruit the regular
army to a war footing, to stimulate
enlistments it pledged itself in a formal
order to discharge upon bis own application
any recruit who wishes to leave
the service upou the conclusion of
peace, although the nominal term of
enlistment was for three years. General
Miles will refer to the present
prospect of a conclusion of the negotiations
at Paris and the signature of
the treaty of peace as an evidence of
the necessity for speedy action. He
will also urge that provision be made
for the fortification of JMamla.
? Chicago Record : A demonstration
in force for moral effect has been
planned by the war department against
Havana. Filzbugh Lee's Seventh
corps is to be landed in Cuba almost
en masse. The movement is to take
the form of an expedition under hostile
conditions. The appearance of a
whole corps of troops, 30,000 strong,
at Havana, the war department believes,
will have a good effect on the
population, and will be a greater thing
in the way of practice iu embarkatiou,
transportation aud debarkation. It
will be much larger than the force
General Shafter took to Santiago.
The plans as perfected by the war department,
contemplate rapid embarkation
from three ports next week.
Transports will be collected at Charleston,
Savannah and Fernandina. Regiments
of minimum streugtii are to be
transported to Charleston and Fernandina.
Regiments of maximum numbers
will be held at Savannah. The
intention is to see how quickly aud
smoothly a corps can be put on board
transports and moved at sea and
landed. Staff officers, to whom this
experience will be valuable, will go to
the three ports to observe the actual
work.
? The annual 6-day champion bicycle
race came to a close iu Madison Square
Garden, New York last Saturday night
at 12 o'elock. Thirty-two men started
in the race the week before; but when
the pistol shot anuounced the end,
there were only 12 still in the competition.
The winner was Charles W.
Miller, of Chicago, the same man who
won the race last year, with Frank
Waller, of Boston, second. During
the six days Miller rode 2,007 miles,
beatiug his last year's record about
2 miles, aud Waller by 22 miles. After
the race, Miller was married to
Miss Genevieve Hanson, of Chicago,
amid the loud cheering and generous
good wishes of between 7,000 and
10,000 spectators. Miller gets from
the management the sum of $1,500, and
for breaking the world's record he gets
the sum of $200, aud for his public
marriage he is said to have got the sum
of $500. Miller is also said to have
received a wedding present of $200
from the wheel firm for which he rides.
Waller gets $1,000 for riding second,
and the others get indefinite sums
ranging from $75 up. The 10 o'clock
score finish : Miller, 2,007.4; Waller, 1,985.2;
Pierce, 1,906.7 ; Albert, 1,822.6;
Gimm, 1,782.2; Lawson, 1,757.6; Aronson,
1,729.5; Nawn, 1,721.7; Foster,

YORKVILLE, S. C.:
WEDNESDAY, DEC'R 14,1898.
? Now that poor General Garcia is
dead, he will get the full meed of praise
that was selfishly withheld from him
in life.
? As the result of a caucus of the
Democratic members of the house last
Saturday, it developed that Representative
Bailey, of Texas, is still the
recognized leader of the minority.
? The statisticians of the New York
and Chicago Produce exchanges figure
that the government estimates of this
year's corn crop, is from 100,000,000
to 200,000,000 too high, and they predict
that prices will run higher than
usual.
? Representative Joseph A. McCullougb,
of Greenville, is working on a
K5U ho nrnnnsPR
vUULI I WU I V Will J TV U1VM KV
to introduce at the next session of the
general assembly. We have no information
as to the details of the bill; but
Mr. McCullough has the reputation of
being an able and patriotic representative,
and it is very likely that his bill
will be quite satisfactory.
? There were some vague eleventhhour
hints in last summer's campaign
about prospective radical changes in
the dispensary law at the next sessiou
of the legislature. Somehow or other,
we do not believe that any such
changes will be made, and really we
think the general assembly will do better
to give its attention to other matters.
? The testimony before the war investigating
commission has developed
a slight hint that in the case of most
of the war and other vessels recently
purchased by the government, Abner
McKinley, the brother of the president,
got commissions. This has been sus
?11 n\r\r\r* Tn fonfr t Koro i a
[JCUICU an aiuu?. XU iuvvj vmv* v
reason to believe that a large portion
of the money spent duriug the war
went into the private pockets of individuals
who made no pretense atgiving
value received ; but there is little probability
that the facts will be legally
proved.
? Somehow we cannot disabuse our
mind of the '.dea that President Monroe
was a very 'evel-headed man, and that
his famous "doctrine," sensible then,
is sensible now. Anyhow, we think
that before trying to spread ov>;r the
world, the United States will do well
to spread over all of North and South
America. It will be time enough after
that to talk of annexiug the Philippines
and other territories that will
not be worth as much to us as it will
cost to govern them.
? Colonel William Jennings Bryan
has resigned bis command of the Third
Nebraska regiment. Both Generals
Lee and Keifer tried to induce Colonel
Bryan to go on to Cuba with the
regiment; but the colonel was convinced
that, under the circumstances,
he would not be be justified in
doing so. His resignation seems to
be the right thing. The treaty of
peace having been signed, there is no
longer any probability of really active
service, and having remained with his
command until even the danger from
yellow fever was over, his enemies
cannot find much excuse to throw
taunts at him. We believe bis services
will be of more value in private life
just now than in the army.
? The following from the Columbia
State points out an object lesson that
can hardly be misunderstood :
Here is Mr. Vanderlip, assistant secretary
of the treasury, reporting from
Puerto Rico : "There is a great amount
of small debts. * * * To compel the
payment of these debts in a coinage
more valuable than that in which they
were contracted would be a great hard
ship." The American people are now
being "compelled" by the same administration,
whose agent writes these
words, to pay their debts "in a coinage
more valuable than that in which thej
were contracted." Some of us think
it "a great hardship." But what does
that matter!?we are uot Puerto Ricans.
We are mere Americans. We
may be able to do justice to others ;
but we can't get justice for ourselves ;
and if we clamor for it we are "repudiators."
? On another page we republish from
the Greenville Mountaineer, the views
of Greenville lawyers on the county
court question. In some respects we
agree in the views expressed and in
others we do not. For instance, we
take 110 stock in the suggestion that
judges should be appointed or elected
by the general assembly. There is
more politics-trading and wire pulling
in a general assembly election than
there is in an election by the people,
and in nine cases out of ten the governor
selects his appointees, not on
account of their fitness; but on account
of their being the favorites of political
friends. The law should provide that
judges and prosecuting attorneys be
men who have been admitted to the
bar, and the balance should he left
with the voters.
THE LIEN LAW.
There has been a good deal of talk
from time to time about the advisability
of repealing the lien law. There
is not so much of such talk going on
now as there has been probably ; but
still there is some.
That the lien law question will come
ud airain in the next treneral assembly,
is altogether likely. The next genera!
assembly, however, will not repeal the
law. That is, we do not think it will.
Like its predecessors for the past 20
years, it will be afraid ; for in many
quarters the proposition is still looked
upon as loaded.
Years ago, The Enquirer would
have been glad to have seen the lieu
law repealed ; but it does not care
much one way or the other now. At
one time the lien law was very necessary,
and it did a good work ; but it
has long since outlived its usefulness.
In failing to repeal it at the proper
time, most of the advantage that had
previously been derived from it was
lost.
From the first, the lien law was
merely the basis of a big speculation.
There were lots of people who were
willing to promise to pay big profits
out of something they did not havebut
hoped to have?and there were
lots of merchants who were willing to
take the necessary risks tor tne prospective
profits. Many merchants
made big money and others failed, the
latter because they did not know when
to quit. Some few small farmers were
benefitted; but most of them were
worsted.
But the quitting time is now at
band. As a general thing, the bottom
fell out of the lien business several
years ago when cotton first dropped
to 6 cents. Some few merchants have
still been able to get along, where liens
were secured by a reasonable amouut
of moral responsibility ; but this year
seems to have about sounded the
death knell of the agricultural lien
business. This is evident by the fact
that, iu many cases, merchants have
been left to gather crops that the producers
had contracted to gather, and
declined because they no longer bad
any financial interest in them.
There may be more or less lien business
for several years yet; but it can
hardly amount to a great deal. Business
men will hardly continue to furnish,
on credit, supplies to make crops
that will not pay the cost of production
; so the law must soou become u
dead letter. Whether or not the general
assembly will repeal it seems to be
of little consequence.
RECORD OF A DAY.
Sunday's Lone List of Violent Deaths In
.fliew xorn vuy.
New York dispatch, Sunday.
The Sunday death list in New York
and vicinity was greatly increased by
causes that ran the gamut from suicide
to murder. The most spectacular
tragedy of the day occurred on the
Speedway. Thousands of people who
had gathered there to watch the speeding
gazed eagerly at what they though
was a race. It was at first, but it ended
in a runaway, and James McDonald,
a prominent Tammany man, and
one of the best known horsemen in the
city, was carried to the Manhattan
hospital in a dying condition.
Nincenzo Garagusti, an Italian banker
and prominent in the Italiau'colony,
was shot and killed in front of his
home, in Broome street tonight, the
bullet piercing his heart. Lawrence
Priore, a drug clerk employed in a
drug store near by, was arrested, and
is charged with the crime.
William Walters, 28 years old,
bought 10 cents worth of carbolic acid
today, and, after kissing his wife and
child good-bye, drank the conteuts of
the bottle. He died in a hospital.
Catharine Werner, a factory girl, 25
years old, drunk carbolic acid today,
and died.
Thomas McKeever, 31 years old, a
freight agent at Roselle, N. J., was
found dead in bed in an apartment in
"Soubrette row." The cause assigned
was heart disease.
Elizabeth Clinton, G4 years old, was
burned to death in her home on Bedford
street.
Hilda Hesse, 14 years old, suicided
with carbolic acid. A quarrel wilh
her father and stepmother made her
despondent.
A man, believed to be Peter Thompson,
of Brooklyn-, jumped off a dock
in Brooklyn and was drowned.
David Walsh, 22 years old, of Hoboken,
while walking r.long the tracks
in the Erie railroad yard, got his foot
caught in a switch and was killed.
A "Varmint" In Anderson.
Anderson correspondence News and
Courier, Saturday : A few days ago,
while Deputy Sheriff Hose was on the
western side of the county, he found a
party of men following the trucks
of a bear, evidently a large one. He
joined in the pursuit for several hours
without coming in sight of the bear.
He had to desist on account of his
duties. Night before last some si range
auimal appeared upon Factory Hill
and killed a couple of dogs, and it has
been said that the large track of a
bear was clearly discernable where the
dogs were found. On the same night
it is claimed that some Negroes on the
opposite side of the city saw the bear.
The consequence of all this is that the
Negroes and children are considerably
excited over the situation and the former
are staying close indoors at night
now.

DRUNK AND DISORDERLY.
G. P. Dobson, a youug white man
in the employ of Mr. W. N. Ashe, got
himself into serious trouble last Sunday
afternoon as the result of too much
liquor. .
It was about 5 o'clock in the afternoon.
The children of Mr. J. N.
O'Farrell were going up the Narrow
Gauge railroad, on their way home
from Sunday school. Dobson came
aloDg, and in a spirit of deviltry, pulled
a pistol from his pocket and fired it
off in close proximity to the children.
Several people saw the occurence
and some of them at once informed
Chief of Police Love, who, accompanied
by Deputy Sheriff Harshaw, went
immediately to put Dobson under
arrest. Still drunk, Dobson made a
1 -/ I HtVAM I
snow ui reaiaiuiice auu uancu upuu
some Negroes who were with him
to come to bis help ; but a suggestion
from Chief Love as to the grave danger
of such a proceeding, was enough
to make the Negroes desist.
Dobson was committed to jail, und
on Monday morning was taken before
Iutendant Carroll on the charges of
drunk and disorderly and carrying
concealed weapon. He was now thoroughly
sober, and also very repentant.
He plead guilty to the charges, offered
the excuse of intoxication and promised
to be more careful in the future.
As be had a previous clean record for
good behavior, Intendant Carroll took
it- into consideration and fined him
$36.60, which includes costs.

afternoon Mi3S Davidson, the
returned missionary from China, talked
to the children in the lecture room of
the First Presbyterian church, which
was filled with children and ladies who
listened with intense interest to her
account of the Chinese in their homes.
She had a table full of curios which
she used to illustrate many of their
customs and modes of worship.- Miss
Davidson is a very attractive speaker
ut all times, and she is never more
charming than when talking to children.
She leaves this afternoon for
Piedmont, where she is to talk to the

The members of Trinity Methodist
Episcopal church have been laboring
under considerable apprehension during
the past week lest the bishop should
decide to put their pastor?Rev. A. N.
Brunson?iu cburge of some larger
cougregatiou. There is a pretty general
feeling, not only among the members
of the congregation, but among
the people generally, that Mr. Brunson
would do credit to almost any appointment,
and this was the principal reason
for the existing apprehension. But
now that Mr. Brunson has been sent
back, all those interested feel relieved.
Greenville News, December 7: The
Rev. Dr. R. G. Patrick, president of the

State : On Thursday afternoon, little |
John London, a 12-year-old son of Mrs. g
Emma Frew London, while playing i
with some comrades in his mother's '
yard, met with an exceedingly painful 1
accident. To a small boy the hollow *
driving part of a cast iron nail puller ^
is little remote from a full mounted t
howilzer, aud it was with one of these
that the trouble occurred. They bad
, fired it several times when it exploded
' with what was at first supposed fatal
! effect, for little John, who was nearest
" it. He was pretty badly lacerated in ,
the legs and groin, and while in a ter- i

AN INTERESTING COMPARISON.
'ar TaoIam and Amiauamunta PrMvlniia tn
1890 and Now.
ireenvllle News. \
The Columbia correspondent of The
tfews and Courier sends that newspa>er
an instructive table of taxation
iud assessments in this slate during
he last 15 years. From this we are
eminded that from 1873 to 1890, under
he "old riug," state lax levies rang:d
from 4J mills, the lowest, which
vas in 1886, to 5}, the highest, which
vas in 1889. In the same period the
olal assessment of property in the
itate ran from $141,000,000, the lowest,
in 1887, to $'150,000,000, the high>st,
in 1890.
Some people may remember that a
lersou known as B. R. Tillman, and
sailing himself a Reformer and the
'Moses" who was to lead the people
rom the bondage of high taxes and
he wilderness of debt, frequently described
these taxes as burdensome and
grievous, and said they were caused
>y wasteful, extravagant and corrupt
idministratious, and bamboozled and
iebaucbed legislatures. We agreed
with him that taxes were too high and
leavy, and that there was waste and
jxtravagauce.
He was elected governor in 1890.
rhe table shows that in eight years
since that time the lowest state levy
aas been 4$ mills, three years, and the
Highest, in 1892, 5} mills. In the same
period assessments have ranged from
^150,000,000, the lowest, in 1890, to
^173,000,000, the present figures. In
jther words, the figures prove that in
.be eight years of "reform" more
ooney has been collected from the
people and spent than in any eight
pears under "the old riug." We go
rurther and say that the preseut taxes
^present far more bales of cotton,
)ushels of corn and pounds of meat
:ban they did in the wildest days of
Radical robbery.
Mr. Tillman says uothing now of
jxtravagance and waste, of debauchery
jr bauiboozliug. We have not changed
jur opinion. We yet believe that there
s extravagance and waste, that after
dgbt years of full power, after the
;ousiituiional convention and all, the
people are being burdened more beavly
than they ought to be burdened,
[t makes no practical difference to the
axpuyer whether the money taken
Fcorn him is stolen or squandered. He
oses it just the same.
The Greenville News demanded reform
from 1883 to 1890, and is yet
lemaudiug it. Mr. Tillman and his
xiends have tried their hands at it and
seemed to have failed miserably, except
that they have landed themselves
lumerously in fat jobs obtained by
false accusations and false promises.
We would like to see the people, the
irst chance they get, make a clean
sweep of the whole present manage
nent, and try a Dew one which will
)e more reasonable and definite in its
judertakings, which will appeal to
tense rather than passion, and which
will make a campaign and build a
government on some foundation other
ban slander and boasting.
A COUNTY COURT ARGUMENT.
Why Magistrate Limehouse Was Removed
From Office.
Magistrate Limehouse, of Summer/ille,
was recently removed from office
>y the governor, and the Columbia
:orre9pondent of The Sunday News
ind Courier has made some extracts
rom the papers iu the case that are
nteresting:
Jos. L. Stoppelbein appeared before
Notary Public Legare Walker, and
itated that he is a practicing attorney
n this state. That be knows Robert
T. Limehouse, a magistrate of the
:ounty of Dorchester, and that he
rerily believed the said magistrate to
>e utterly incapable of dispensing jusice,
even if he tried, which is an idea
oo remote to be even entertained.
That he (Jos. Stoppelbein) was forced
o turn away clients who bad cases
>efore the said magistrate. Mr. Stop>elbein
then gives the following eximple
of Magistrate Limebouse's highlanded
proceedings: One Hacklas
Gadsden took up a lot of cows under
he provisions of the general stock law
ind brought the same to Magistrate
iweeny, as provided for by law. Magstrate
Sweeny instructed Hacklas
Jadsden to bold the said stock subject
o the order of bis court. Shortly
ifter, Magistrate Limebouse issued
laim aDd delivery proceedings, and
eized the said cows contrary to law.
Jpon the call of the case Magistrate
iweeny formally notified Magistrate
iimebouse that at the time of such
eizure on Limebouse's part the said
tock was in tbe hands of his court and
nder his jurisdiction, and asked that
he stock be turned over to bim. This
iimebouse refused to do, and tbe deonent
was compelled to appeal to
udge Aldrich for mandamus, wbicb
ecessilated a trip to Barnwell, S. C.,
t considerable expense and loss to
epouent's* client. Mr. Stoppelbein
ites other examples. He then goes
u to say : By such transactions and
jrcing the people to apply to the
igber courts from time to time to keep
im straight, it works a great bardlip
upuu tbe people, aud the said
lagistrate ought to be removed.
Iu cases coming up before the said
lagistrate the depondent has repeatJly
filed strong affidavits showing tbe
? J' - -i J-.4 A A ~
rtjuuice 01 saiu magistrate auu uclauded
change of venue, which was in
yery case met wilh a refusal. That in
ie case of the state against Sam Stony,
le magistrate, in a boisterous and bullazing
maimer attempted to intimidate
ie wituesss, and when this fact was
ade the grounds of appeal, the magtrate
in making his return said :
No such transaction occurred in my
>urt," and which remark was dis-*
roved by au allidavit made by Mr.
. R. Donnelly, of Summerviile.
And, lastly, the depoueut regards
ie said magistrate as totally unfit to
