The President’s Message.
The message of President Harrison was
read to both Houses of Congress, on Wednes
day. It is very long and gives a comprehen
sive view of everything relating to the for
eign and domestic policy of the United States.
It is a creditable document in this respect
bat of course Democrats must take exception
to much that it contains, believing the Pre
sident's views lo be unsound and not ealcu
lated to advance the welfare of the people of
tbia eountry.
He gives a review of what has been accom
plished by the State Department, among
which ase reciprocal trade arrangements with
Brazil and the West Indies.
The progress of negotiations with Great
Britain wMh regard to the taking of seals in
Behring Sea is adverted to.
It is gratifying to be able to state, says the
President, that Germany, Denmark, Italy,
Austria and France, in the order named, have
opened their porta to inspected American
pork products.
He gives a statement of the correspondence
with Italy with regard to tbe lynching of
Italians at New Orleans and thinks a friendly
conclusion will be reached.
Our relations with Chili are set forth at
length and the President says full reparation
will be demanded for the outrages perpetrat
ed upon American citizens.
With regard to the outbreak against for
eigners in China he says tbe government will
insist upon protection by the Chinese govern
ment of our citizens peaceably sojourning in
China, and referring to the rejection by that
government of Mr. Blair as minister from
this government to China, he declares that
no minister to China will be named while ex
isting laws are in force.
He refers to the remonstrances made by
this country to Russia against the cruel tieat
ment of Jews by tbe Russian government.
The President takes strong ground for aid
by our government to tbe Nicaragua Canal
project, but Congress will probably have a
good deal to say on this subject before his
suggestions are adopted.
He has nothing to say about the disappear
ance of tbe surplus in tbe United States
Treasury which caused President Cleveland
so mudh concern, and extols tbe McEinley
tariff as a most beneficent measure.
He gives a summary of tbe finances of tbe
country. In bis view free coinage would dis
astrously affect business interests. On this
point be says : ,
“We could not hope to maintain an equal
ity in tbe purchasing power of tbe gold and
silver dollar in our own markets, and in for
eign trade the stamp gives no added value to
tbe bullion contained in coins. The produc
ers of tbe country, its farmers and laborers,
have tbe highest interest that every dollar,
paper or coin, issued by tbe government shall
be as good as any other. If there is one less
valuable than another its sure and constant
errand will be to pay them for their toil and
for their crops. The money-lender will pro
tect himself by stipulating for payment in
gold, bat the.laborer has never beenable to do
that. To place business upon a silver basis j
would mean a sadden and severe contraction
of the currency, by tbe withdrawal of gold
aad gold notes, and such an unsettling of all
values as would produce a commercial panic.
I cannot believe tha,t a people so strong and
prosperous as ours will promote such a poll
•y."
The President thinks bi-metaiism desirable )
but uitil foreign nations are willling to adopt '
it this country would lose instead of gain by
acceding tt> the demands of the silver-produc
ess-
He refers to the reports of tbe Departments
and urges an increase of tbe navy.
The President also adverts to tbe “great dil
igence” of (he Pension Bureau, which has
been issuing certificates at tbe rate of 30,000
a month. The total number of pensioners on
tbe 30th of last June was 678,160, so that by
this time it must exceed 800,000.
He compliments tbe Department of Agri
culture upon tbe .great results already at
tained in disseminating agricultural and hor
ticultural information; in stimulating and
directing a further diversification of tbe crops;
in detecting and eradicating diseases of do
mestic animals; and, more than all. in tbe
dose and informal contact which it has estab
lished and maintains with tbe farmers and
stock raisers of the whole country.
He recommends an increased appropriation
for the Civil Service Commission. Congress
is not likely to grant this, however. The
Republicans are very sore over Commission
er Roosevelt’s expose of the way Republi
can primary elections are managed in Balti
more and tbe Democrats are cot very enthu
siastic with regard to tbe way in which tbe
Civil Service Commiesion has been adminis
tered.
The President opposes a change in the
method of choosing Presidential electors. He
vigorously condemns gerrymandering— by
Democrats, of coarse be means —overlooking
tbe means adopted by bis own party to hold
tbe Legislature of New York against the
wishes of a majority of the people of that
State. His own election, it is pointed out,
furnishes an illustration against his own ar
guments, for Cleveland received a majority
of nearly a quarter of a million oftbepopular
vote, and yet Mr. Harrison became Presi
dent.
Altogether Mr. Harrison’s message con
tains nothing startling. It is common-place
and will have ao effect whatever in shaping
tbe legislation of Congress. All it will ac
complish, perhaps, will be to strengthen bis
party in upholding tbe McEinley high tariff.
TUfi State Fanners’ Convention.
Judge Edward Stake, President of tbe
Maryland State Farmers’ Association, an
nounces that the next annual convention
wlh be held in Baltimore on tbe second
nesdsy Of January next, tbe 13th of tbe
month. Ik will be composed of delegates
from each Farmeas’ Association, Farmers’
Club or Agricultural Association in the
Stale. In addititien to delegates from such
organisations, the farmers of each county are
urged to hold voluntary meetings and choose
ms their representatives in tbe convention as
many delegates as tbe county has lepresenta
tivss in tbe General Assembly of the State.
For Harford coanty the number is five.
It is pibposed to have tbe convention sit
for three days, its proceedings beginning with
the annual address of tbe President on the
first day, an address by tbe Secretary of Ag
riculture on the second day, and addresses on
fruit culture, stock breeding, commercial
featilizers, &c ,on the third day, Tbe con
vention will likewise consider the subject of
legislation to secure the improvement of our
peblic roads, a new assessment law, and an
equitable system of taxation, adapted to pro
mote the agricultural interests of tbe State.
These annnal meetings of farmers of tbe
State, of which tbia will be the seventh, have
net only been interesting and instructive, and
if they have resulted in nothing more they
hays, at least, made tbe farmers of tbe State
better acquainted with each other. The Leg
islature is occupied with so many things that
it cannot give due consideration to tbe inter
ests of farmers. It is well, therefore, for in
telligent and progressive farmers to meet to
gether and agree npon tbe legislation needed lo
benefit their condition. The Legislature, no
doubt, would give attentive consideration to
suggestions made by the convention. Ope of
the most important subjects which the con
vention could consider is the formulation of a
plan for the betterment of our public roads.
The agitation of this subject has already re
sulted in great good, but a well-defined
policy, involving State aid, seems to be need
ed.

The Fifty Second Congress.
The first session of the 52d Congress met
at Washington on Monday. The Senate was
called to order at noon by Vice President
Morton, bnt the House was nut organized
and ail that the Senate could do was to pro
ceed with the swearing in of new members.
The newly-appointed Maryland Senator, Mr.
Charles H. Gibson, was one of these. Sena
tor Gorman was also present, still showing
traces of tbe platform accident in Baltimore.
All eyea followed him as be walked around
the chamber, greeting his fellow members.
The protracted contest over the Speaker
ship resulted iu tbe selection by the Demo
cratic caucus of Judge Crisp, of Georgia, on
tbe thirtieth ballot. All of tbe other candi
dates except Mr. Mills having withdrawn the
choice was practically between Crisp and
Mills. The latter received 105 voles to 119
for Crisp.
Mr. Criap acknowledged the honor in a
brief speech, in which be declared that Lis
election meant no step backward in tariff re
form.
For the minor offices the caucus chose
Eerr, of Pennsylvania, for Clerk; Yoder, of
Ohio, for Sergeant-at-Arms; Turner, of New
York, for door-keeper, and Dalton, of India
na, for Postmaster.
Commenting on tbe selection of Judge
’Crisp the Philadelphia Times says:
“While there will be no hall in the work
of tariff reform because of the success of Mr.
Crisp, it will be generally, and we believe
gratefully, accepted by the country as a tri
umph ot the more conservative element of
the Democracy. The one unerring index of
tbe wisdom of Crisp’s election to the Speak
ership is in tbe fact that the Republican lead
ers were practically unanimous in the desire
for the success of Mills, and hoped to gain
great political advantage from it. This does
not prove Mills’ unfitness, but it was unmis
takable as lo tbe expediency of bis selection.
On Tuesday the House of Representatives
was duly organized. Mr. Crisp, for Speaker,
was placed in nomination by Mr. Holman, of
Indiana; Mr. Henderson, of Illinois, on be
half of the Republican caucus, nominated ex-
Speaker Reed, and Jere Simpson, of Eansas,
named Thomas E. Watson, of Georgia, as
the Farmers’ Alliance candidate for Speaker,
Crisp received 238 votes, Reed 83 and Wat
son 8.
Speaker Crisp was conducted lo the chair,
amidst cheering and hand clapping on the
part of the Democratic members, by Messrs.
Mills and Reed. He spoke as follows:
—“Gentlemen of the Home of Representatives :
For the great honor you have conferred upon
me I return you my heartfelt thanks. I
shall endeavor to discharge the duties of
Speaker with courtesy, with firmness and
with absolute impartiality. Let us unite in
tbe hope that our labors here may result in
tbe advancement of the prosperity, tbe honor
and the glory of our beloved country. I am
now ready lo take the oath of office, and re
quest the gentleman from Indiana, Mr. Hol
man, to administer it.”
Mr. Holman then administered the oath of
office to Mr. Crisp, who responded clearly
and firmly at the end, “1 do.”
The officers chosen by tbe Democratic
caucus were then elected, together with Rev,
Dr. Milburn, the blind preacher, who has
been chaplain of the House for many years.
New members were also sworn in.
The Maryland delegation, it is said, will
come in for their share of tbe patronage
under the minor officers of the House, hav
ing voted for all of tbe successful candidates.
Senator Gorman has again been re-elected
chairman of tbe Democratic caucus commit
tee.
—Last Friday two men, one carrying a
small satchel, entered tbe office of Russell
the New York millionaire,and inquired
UrMr. Sage. Being admitted to tbe private
office the man with the satchel said to Mr.
Sage: “We want one million two hundred
thousand dollars. We want them right here
and now.” Mr. Sage, concluding that the man
was a crank, said that it was a great deal of
money and be would have to think about it.
' The visitor replied: “We cannot wait. The
money is wanted now. In this satchel I have
dynamite—pounds ot it. Unless you band
over the money up she goes.” Mr. Sage
made another effort to temporize and told tbe
visitor Jie must come again. At tbe word
the man raised tbe satchel at arm's length.
“You will not?” he shouted. “Then here
goes.” A tremendous explosion followed.
The building was wrecked. The dynamiter
was blown to pieces, his head being severed
from his body. Mr. Sage was rendered un
conscious but was only slightly hurt. Two
of Mr. Sage’s clerks were killed and several
other persona badly injured. The dynamiter>
it was ascertained, was H. D. Wilson, an es
caped lunatic. Mr. Sage had previously re
ceived threatening letters signed James Walsh
demanding the sum named by tbe madman.
There seems to be a general agreement that
more stringent regulations are needed for tbe
sale or use of dynamite.
—Arrangements are being made by the
Chesapeake Bay Dog Club for an exhibition
at the Wotld’s Fair at Chicago of wild duck
shooting on the fiats at Havre de Grace. It
is proposed to place on the lake a double sink
box and a stool of 500 decoys. Another lay
out of decoys will represent buskwhack
shooting. There will also be a big-gun skiff
on which will be mounted the big gun used
by the father of the great Havre de Grace
gunner, Wash. Barnes. Ortfe or more expert
duck shooters will be in attendance. At in
tervals the bushwhack boat will be sculled
out to the decoys and a blank shell will be
fired. Then the big-gun skiff will be paddled
out with tbe customary short paddles, and
when at tbe proper distance a load of powder
will be fired from tbe gun. The attendants
will also show bow expertly they can handle
themselves. They will show how easy it is j
after one learns how, to throw one's feet out
and to turn and shoot at ducks coming at
the head of the box or from any quarter.
Pure-bred Chesapeake Bay dogs will also be
exhibited, a tolling-blind and its mode of
operation shown, ami tbe quickness with
which an expert can take up decoys will also
be demonstrated. This feature will doubtless
be as attractive and interesting as any other
at the fair.

He Wanted a Government Loan.
A Washington correspondent of the St. Louis
Globe-Democrat ia responsible for the following
story. Tbe incident may be true, bat we have
no doubt tbe correspondent bas mixed up lo
calities. Harford farmers are not quite so verd
ant as this particular farmer appears to bave
been:
“la this tbe place that bas charge of tbe
Government loans —tbe 4 per cents ?” a fanner
asked in tbe office of the Fourth Auditor of tbe
Treasury yesterday. Tbe clerk did not under
stand him.
•‘Where do I go to get a loan?” tbe farmer
continued, fumbling away at bis pocket with
one hand while be held bis bat in tbe other.
“Oh,” said the clerk, beginning to smile,
“the Government does not lend money.” Then
be suggested, pityingly, “You must be think
ing of tbe Alliance sub-treasury scheme.”
“That’s right,” said the farmer. “It’s the
sub-treasury 1 want." He drew from bis
pocket a little roll of bills. "Here’s *lB. Gim
me all the money that will pay interest on for
one year. You can take a mortgage on my
farm.”
Tbe farmer stood expectantly, while tbe clerk
first looked him over and then demanded : “Say,
my friend, where do you live anyway! Who
told you to come down here?”
“Up in Harford county, Md,” replied the
farmer. “A man told me if the elections went
all right I could get all of tbe money 1 wanted
from the Government at 4 per cent. Isn’t this
tbe place? I’ve been bunting all tbe morning
for it.”
“Well,” said tbe clerk. “You’ve struck the
right place to find out someoody’s been fooling
you. Go back to UacJLld coanty and tell your
friends Uncle Sam isTot In tbe lending busi
ness just yet.” 1
The old farmer went away sorrowful. i

Bitten by a Mad Dog.—Last Friday morn
ing two men named Unik, who live near Ab
ingdon, were engaged in hauling wood. As
one of them thrust bis band through a fence
for the purpose of opening a gate a setter dog
which was running by seized bis ai m above tbe
wrist, tbe dog’s teeth penetrating through tbe
man's coat and underclothing to tbe skin.—
Being unable to shake tbe dog loose Unik
reached his other band over tbe fence sad
grasped it by tbe collar, holding it in
this manner while bis brother procured a rope
and tied tbe animal to the fence. Tbe dog,
besides au ordinary collar, bad on a collar with
a tax tag, indicating that it came from Havre
de Grace. The dog being thus secured, Rev.
Collins, a colored neighbor, shot and killed tbe
animal with a pistol. Dr. Opperman found
that tbe dog's teeth bad merely bruised tbe
flesh on Unlk’s arm and bad not entered tbe
skin. As a matter ot precaution, however, be
cauterized tbe wound, and thinks no serious
results will follow tbe bite. Tbe Doctor also
made a post mortem examination of tbe dog,
and found in its stomach only a small quanti
ty of straw—an indication that it was rabid.
Tbe same dog passed through Bush, tbe same
day, and bit a dog and a goose belonging to
