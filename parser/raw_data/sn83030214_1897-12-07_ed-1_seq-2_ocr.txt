then tea minutes had been consumed, and most
of the people, in the galleries filed out of them
with a marked sense of the Insufficiency of the
entertainment The reading of the Message
which took place later In the afternoon, was. as
usual, a wholly perfunctory performance, for
printed coplea are always furnished to the audi?
tors In advance, and those who submit to hear
the President'? views declaimed from the desk
may be put down either as slaves to legislative
punctilio or as victims to some Insidious and
mysterious form of hypnotism. (The full text ,
of the Message will be found in another part of ,
this paper.)
After the reading of the Message. Mr. Wal- ;
taaell announced the death of his colleague. Sena?
ten James Z. Oer.rge. of Mississippi, and offered
the uKuul resolution of condolence with the dead
Senator's family. This was adopted, and as a
further mark of respect the Senate adjourned
until to-morrow.
SrENF.S TN THE HOUSE.
?The House will come to order," commanded
Speaker Reed, as he brought his new and beau?
tiful gilded gavel down on the desk before him at
noon to-day; and then, after a pause, he said, as
the members with one accord aroso and stood
with biiwed heads. "The chaplain will offer
praver." Prayer having b?>en offered, the roll
of members wa? called by State?, after which
the Speaker announced: "The Clerk reports BOfl
member? present?a quorum." A message was
th?n received from the Senate, five members
elected to fill vacancle? were ?worn in. commit?
tees wero appointed to Inform the President
and Renate- that the House of Representatives
was ready for business, and a report from the
Committee on Rules providing that the dally sit?
tings should begin at noon was received and
adopted. In ?uch ?Imple and methodical fash?
ion was tho ?r?ond se?slon of the House of Rep?
resentatives of the LVth Congress begun.
Down to thl? point, when the House took a
reces? to hear from the President, the official :
proceeding? had been enlivened by one amueing
incident, for which Congressman Dennis If.
Hurler, of Brooklyn, waa responsible. Mr. ?
Hurley, as his name might denote, is of Irish J
extraction, and to-day's was his maiden speech.
It was a short one. but it "brought down the ?
house." and, what was more to the purpose, I
?.vas a successful one. The credentials of all
UN "new members except Mr. Driggs, who had
been etoctod to succeed Mr. Wilson, of the Hid ?
New-York District, had been read, and they j
were about to be sworn In, when Mr. Hurley
arose and said.
Mr. ?Speaker. I ask unanimous consent that
Mr. Driggs, who has been elected to till a va?
cancy In the Hid District, be allowed to swear
In."
Mr. Hurley war asked what reason there was
why this should be done, and he explained
that the canvass of the oflicial vote uf Brooklyn
had not pet been completed and certified to the
Secretar? of State at Albany, and, therefore,
Mr. Driggs had not received hi? official creden?
tials.
"There Is no doubt that he was elected?"
a^ked the Soeaker.
MR. HURLEY CAUSES MERRIMENT.
"None whatever," replied Mr. Hurley, who,
as he began to draw a paper from his pocket,
continued: "I have here a letter of congratula?
tion"? but he got no further. The House
roared with merriment, and Mr. Bailey, the
alert leader of the Democratic minority, arose
and solemnly remarked:
"I understand that Mr. Driggs is a Democrat,
and. as this request is made by a Republican, 1
have no doubt whatever that Mr. Driggs waa
elected, and therefore will not object."
Mr. Driggs then took his place in the line, and
Lie oath of office was administered to hlin with
the rest
As soon as the order for a recess was made
the vast and brilliant audience that had crowd
ed the galleries, and the larger crowd which,
as usual, had failed to gain admission, gradu?
ally melted away, and the floor t>f the House was
also Quickly and almost completely deserted.
The crowd of onlookers is such as one always
Fees on the first day of a session. On th? morn?
ing of that day every i>tr?ang?? In town, and a
good many of the reaident?, go to the Capitol, ar?
rayed in their best, to witness a spectacle which
?eldorn offers any new or startling feature, but
which seemed to draw as well to-day as It ever
did. The last session ended less than four
month? and a half ago. and thl? morning, when
member? began to gather, th-y greeted one an
t other In a matter-of-fact way. as though they
Avere meeting after a week's separation. One
of those general elections which always affords
food for congratulation to some and for sorrow
to others had not been held. There were no
boastings of Increased pluralities or explana?
tions of the causes of defeat. Of course, the
men who aad served together through several
Congresses had picked up some new stories and
anecdotes, which they related to their chums
with gusto.
The one member of the House who was kept
busy blushing and receiving congratulations
from the time he appeared until the Speaker'?
gavel fell was Mr. Belknap, of Illinois, who,
?fier the adjournment of the last sessi.-?, be?
came the son-in-law of Representative Steele,
of Indiana. It Is only fair to the former to say
that the father-in-law was also heartily con?
gratulated ? ? having acquired so promising a
son-in-law.
ASSEMBLINO OF THE MEMBERS.
It was 11 o'clock before the "shoals of states?
men" of which one sometimes read? were visi?
ble, and even then the leaders were conspicuous
by their absence, most of them preferring the
seclusion of their committee rooma A half
hour later the floor wa? thronged with Congress?
men, office-seeker?, curious visitors and others,
and desks began to blossom with the usual
"floral tributes " A few of the latter were ex?
ceedingly conspicuous?too much ?o for the re?
cipients, who caused them to be quickly re?
moved. One etood or. Oeneral Grosvenor's desk
?an elaborate creation of red roses and yellow
corysanihemunis. beneath the branches of which
reposed a lamb, which, on being properly ma
rlpula^ed, cried "baa! baa!" In a plaintive and
painfully realistic ton?. Thla tribute was from
tne Ohio Wool Growers' Association, but why
they saould have chosen the Spanish colon to
convey their admiration was not explained.
Some of the other flower pieces were exceedingly
elaborate, and must have cost a pretty penny
if bought at private establishments.
One veteran member who was In his seat
early was ex-Speaker Grow, of Penns> Ivania,
who first ?at in Congress nearly half a century
ago, having been chosen to succeed David Wil
mot. author of the famous anti-slavery "Pro?
viso," and who Is still hale and hearty. Near
Mr. Grow ?at one of his colleagues, Marriatt
Broslus, chairman of the Civil Service Reform
Committee, and a doughty champion of the
merit system. Among the early comers on the
Democratic elde were Cox, of Tennessee, the
champion of State hanks, who Is always ready
for a bout with the chairman of his committee
Mr. Walker, of Massachusetts, and Terry, of
Arkansas, a rather picturesque figure, clad in a
?hade of "Confederate gray." He "fit Into" the
Brooks-Baxter war twenty years ago and more,
a?nd when he addresses the House, it Is In a
voice which suggests that he must have spent
the previous night on the bank of a foggy
stream.
CLEARING THE FLOOR.
As the minute-hand of the clock points to 1J:45
the scene on the floor suddenly changes. One
of the employee ?sf tbe House delivers the first
speech of the session. It Is spoketf by di?
rection of the doorkeeper, and requests all per?
son? w ho are not entitled to the privilege? of the
floor to retire. It la an effective and moving
speech, for within two minutes the floor Is
tleared of all who are not entitled to enjoy Its
privileges. Now one can better see and identify
the ?statesmen, and a careful survey of the as?
semblage?for it is nearly as full a? lt will be
to-day?shows that only tbree conspicuous
statesmen and leader? are absent?McMlllln, of
Tennessee; J. Hamilton Lewis, of Washington,
and Jerry Simpson, of Kansas. All the rest
6?? m to be here. Even Mr. Qulgg has paused
long enough from his labor of "creating aus?
pice?" to come to Washington and answer to
his name. Here. too. 1? Mr. Bailey, of Texas,
that leader of majestic and Impressive pulchri?
tude, who take? himself almost a? seriously as
Mr. Qulgg take? himself, but, of course, with
much less reason. And there are others, who
take themselves less seriously, but whom,
strangely enough, the country take? more se?
riously? Dlngley, Dalzell. Henderson. Boute)le,
Bayers, F ay ne, Bland, Hltt, Groevenor. Cannon
and scores upon scores of others. And here
comes Pitney, of New-Jersey, bright and spry
and apparently In the best of health. You would
hardly believe that tbe flag on the Capitol was
?et at half-staff only a few weeks ago on his
account, and that obituary notice? of Mr. Pit?
ney were published in some of the newspapers.
And aere, too, comes Dockery. of Missouri, the

Several ex-ronpre?smen of moire or less pas:
and present prominence are on hand. Among
them Is S. V. White. Of New-Yoik. whose eye
is as bricht and his movements as quick and
nervous as when he sat here and beipea to
make laws years ago. Since then he has regu?
larly attended the first day of every session of
Congress and his absence on such an occasion
would be almost as quickly noticed by any old
timer as would be that of the venerable Assist?
ant Doorkeeper Chancy, whose service has
covered ? m\|Ch longer period than did that
of Mr White, and who haB been the faithful
custodian of Republican caucus secrets since
the lime of Thaddens Stevens.
Hut the recias is over, and members settle
themselves to hear the reading of the Message.
Many of them follow the reading, pencil in
hand, for to each one has b"cn furnished a

Washington, Dec. I-Pollowlng are the views ex
j pressed by Members of Congress In regard to Pres
; idem McKinley*? Message:
Senator Allison-i do not take the deepening
view concerning our currency which the President
presents. While there are some Improvement?
which I would like to see mode, I think we shall be
i?ble to get along If we do not get any curren y
legislation, and as the situation presents Itaelt
now it looks as If it might be Impracticable to
secure legislation on the lines of the Presidents
recommendations. The recommendations In regard
to Cuba are humane and consolerete.
Senator Hal??--The recommendation In regard to
Cttba Is In all respects admirable, and one with
Which I am much pleased. On tho subject of
the finances the President does not press for Imme?
diate action, and aa for myself. I do not believe
that such would be possible under the circum?
stances.
Senator Hoar-It struck me ?s a wise, compact
and carefully considered document. The portion of
It relating to Caba Is most cxcdlmit.
