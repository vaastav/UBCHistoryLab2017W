t&rE litors often betray a low estimate
Tjf the character unJ iutelligencs of their
readers. For example, the first article in
last Friday's Suubury Dem tcrat reads as
follows :
"York city f re, va the work of men who
iesire to be poliueally revenged upon the
great Democratic uronholii."
The Aarousburg Ikrich'xr also asserted
that the attempted terrible fires in New
York city were the work of Abolitionists.
What are the firt? 1st, Kiehmoud
papers, both before an 1 after that event,
openly urged aud advocated tho burning
of the Union cities by private bauds. '21,

The Lead Letter Office.
The 1'ostma.L.r General's report con-
tains some curious Matistics relating to
this branch of the Department.
The whole cumber of dead lettors
received during the year, wis over three
and a half iiiiilions, au iucreaso of nearly
a million over tho preceding year.
1 Lere wcrfl returned to toe respective
owners, "25,75- money letters, continuing
Sl-il.fill. The number of letters contain-
in; papers of value, suob as checks, druf's,
bills of exchange, was 12, 10, and
tho va'ua of tho enclosures was $1,-
()15,(k)1. Tho a-mouut of money annually
sent as:ray is surprising.
LetterscontaiiiinB photoersnlis, jewelry,
Slc, numbered 43,380. lu May last, a
large number of packages, containing mis
cellaneous articles, which had been accu-
; njulatiug fof ,ovcn, werfl classiIicd
i and sold at public ntiotiou, tho proceeds
amnuuting to S 1,175.-7.
Tho Lumber of what might be called
letter-writers' blunder? that is, letters
misdirected, or without postage stamps
was 115, iil'l. Tho misdirections alone,
which were so bad that tho letters could
not bo delivered, wero GS,0G3. A lurge
number of this last class were without any
address whatever, and in many instances
contained incisures of value.
T, A.yr l .. u j .
Tbero wero 4,'2o0 letters addressed to
fietiliou.s persnus or firms, evidently for
the purpose f conducting some fraudulent
Lusiucss, many of them containing remit
ta:;eos. There wen 11,010 dead letters written
in foreign lancuagcs. Tho Postmaster

Tho following, though writton many
years ago, is so applicable that one would
aImost upp80 il written for tho present
, times :
"And is it the duty of every man (to
pray) for bis oirn country? God, nature.
j common sense, and self interest say 1 La I
And what must wo think of tbo wrotohes
who not only do Dot thus pray, but labor
lo destroy the publio peace, to subvert tbo
government of tbeir country, to raise se
ditions, and to destroy all its civil and
religious institutions t Think of them f
Why, that hemp would be tlimjmceil by
hanging them." Dr. Adorn Vlark'i Com
mentaries on Psalm 122, 6.
An amusing fact occurred in New York,
on tho visit of Gen. Grant to that city on
Monday. Ho took a hack to conduct bim
to his hotel. Tbe driver, after depositing
the General, gave bis friends the following
toast : "Hero's to mcself, Dennis Con
nelly, the biggest man in Ameriky but
one. I've driven tbe Lieutenant General
of the United States, and it's more than
Bobby Lee ever did." The listeners ap
preciated tbe force of this sentiment and
applauded tbe uttercr.
Lieut. II. W. Sewall, of the U. S. rove
nue service, bas boon tried by oourt-mar-tial,
in Baltimore, upon tho ohargo of
making false returns of payments, thereby
defrauding tho government out of about
$100,000. He was found guilty, and
sentenced to imprisonment for life in tbo
Clinton penitentiary, New York. The
sentence has been approved, and tbo pris
oner removed to the prison.
Coal Dust. There is a company or
ganized in Philadel. to manufacture fuel
out of the dust of coal. Thoy have dis
covered a process by which tbe dust is
formed and kept in a solid compact mass,
and their experiments provo it to be a
very valuable fael. It burns freely and
thoroughly, and gives out as much heat as
solid anthracite.
"Out of tbe mouth of babes and suck
lings" is truo now as in the day of the
Psalmist. Do readers remember Rebecca, 1

Second Day's Fiht lefuro NahviIIe!

To the JVesithiit of the L'. V., it'-c..-
I have the honor to report that tbe i
enemy Las been pressed at all points to-1
i day, on his line of retreat to the Brent-
wood Hills. I bavo ordered tho pursuit
to be continued in tho
morning at day- j
lirht Allhoogh the froops are much fa.
tigucd, the utmost enthusiasm prevails.
Although I have no report of tho num
ber of prisoners captured, I know the
number is largo.
The woods, fields and entrenchments
are strewn with the enemy's small arms,
abandoned in the retreat.
Our loss does not exceed 2,000, and

oners, so that the triumph teems lo bavo
been great, and Hood's army in danger of
cntiru loss. The gunboats in the river
aided in the various actions. "Kvcrybody,
black and white, behaved splendidly,"
says Sec'y Stanton, in publishing the
above.
Hood's communication with Mobile is
severed, and a Union cavalry expedition
towards Mubilo is creating great fear in
that city.

Tho Provost Marshall of Nashvillu re
ports 5,000 prisoners, and 49 ptoses of ar-
tillcry as being already secured, from last

A dispatch from Lexington, this eve -
ning, states that Burhridge had a fi,;bt, at
hingspnrt, lenn., with nasi. luke s bri -
(lade, (formerly John Morgan'.) and rou-
ted them with a loss to tbe enemy of 150 i
killed, wounded and prisoners. Dick
Morgan, a brother of Johu's, was captured. '
Tbo Rebels acknowledge that at Frank-'
lin tbey bad five Generals killed, five '
wounded, and one captured a trrrib'e
hiss of th tfn General in une buttle.
Our cavalry recently swept into

Rebel papers say Sherman had taken a
fort on tho river which enabled bim to
communicate with the Union fleet. '
Returned prisoners say Sherman had
, , , ' , ' ,
done great damage and was eausmg much
alarm. They think be will take not only
Savannah, but Charleston also.

Some of tho Rebel papers aro of the opin
ion that a iunction between Sherman, and i
the forces under Foster and Duhlgreen,
Will bo attempted.
To Maj. Gen. Dix : Dispatches have
, , " , .
been received to-day from Gen. Foster,
who had a personal interview, on the 14th
. ... i,
msr., witn ucn. Sherman, at Jort .l Al- :
lister, Which had been taken by assault on !
the precoding day. Savannah was closely
besieged, and an engagement with tho Reb
el forces there was confidently expected
was to be surrounded in two days, and, if
not surrendered, Sherman would open bis
batteries upon it.
Foster reports that Sherman's army is
in splendid condition, having lived on its
march on tho turkeys, chickens, sweet
potatoes, and other luxuries of the oiti
cens, and that bis march met with but
feeble resistance.
E M. Stantos, Sec. nf War.
The Rebel raiders from Canada into'
Vermont wero discharged by a Canadiaa ,
Judge on the plea of want of jurisdiction. '
Gen. Dix immediately issued orders for!
the Union forces hereafter to pursue and j
punish such marauders wherever found.

have issued orders for tho re-arrest of the ,
