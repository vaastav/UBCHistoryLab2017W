BALFOUR AND CABINET RESIGN
King Edward Accepts Same and In
structs Campbell-Bannerman
for Form New Cabinet.
London, Deo s.—The political crisis
in the United Kingdom has reached a
climax Arthur J. Balfour, the pre
mier, has formerly tendered the resig
nations of himself and the members of
his cabinet to King Edward, who ac
cepted them. His majesty has iuvited
Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman to an
interview, when he will offei him the
mission of foiming a new cabinet. Sir
Henry will accept the task, and within
a few days a new government will be
formed
It may be stated as certain that Eord
Rosebery will be entirely ingored in
the makeup of the cabinet and that
John Morley will be one of the chief
advisers of Sir Henry in drawing up
the list of his official family, which
will be presented to his majesty.
Mr. Morley himself is considered like
ly to go to the Indian office, aud it is
probable that Herbert Henry Asquith
will be chancellor of the exchequer.
The foreign affairs portfolio will go
either to Lord Elgin or Sir Edward
Grey, though the latter is considered
likely to be made secretary of the colo
nies.
One thing is certain —that Sir Henry
Campbell-Bannerman has explained
his attitude on home rule for Ireland
to those liberal leaders who are known
to be opposed to home rule on the lines
of the last bills introduced in parlia
ment. Since his speeoh at Stirling,
which raised such a fuiore, Sir Henry
has not made any statement, but it is
confidently asserted in the liberal olubs
that he is ready with a policy which
will secure the adhesion of the British
nationalists, and at the same time
avoid raising the issuo of one of the
prominent planks in his platform.
There is some uncertainty as to when
the dissulution of parliament will be
effective, but it is not considered prob
able until after the new year.
An interesting feature of the politi
cal situation is the prospect of a oloser
alliance between the Irish and the
labor parties in the new parliament.
James Keir Hardie, the socialist and
independent member, in a political
speeoh tonight frankly invited suoh an
alliance. He pointed out that 45 labor
members combined with 75 Irish mem
bers would provide a voting strength
which no government, however strong,
could afford to ignore.
RECORD OF LIFE SAVERS.
Thousands of Persons Rescued and
Many Crafts Saved.
The work of the life saving service
for the last fiscal year is summed up
in a repert of General Superintendent
Kimball to the secretary of the treas
ury, recently made public. The life
saving crews saved and assisted In
saving 464 imperiled vessels and their
cargoes, besides affording assistance
of more or less importance to 677 oth
er vessels, including craft of all kinds,
making a total of 1141 vessels to which
aid was furnished. In addition, the
report states, 83 steamers and 88 sail
ing vessels running into danger were
warned of their peril by the signals of
the patrols and lookout in time to
escape disaster. The saving of many
lives and much property is attributed
to such warnings.
No less than 365 disasters to docu
mented vessels occurred during the
period stated, involving the lives of
4809 persons, of whom 27 were lost.
The estimated value of vessels and
cargoes so affected was $10,320,660, of
which $7,917,385 was saved. Sixty
three vessels were totally loßt. Succor
was afforded at the various stations to
624 persons, to whom an aggregate of
1510 days' relief was furnished. Four
hundred and twenty casualties were
sustained by undocumented vessels,
such as sail boats and row boats, in
volving 955 persons, 10 of whom were
lost. The value of property involved
in these casualties is estimated at
$264,690, of which $258,025 was saved.
The report concludes with an earn
est appeal for pensions to widows and
children of members of the life sav
ing crews losing their lives in the
performance of duty and for retire
ment when disabled from injury or dis
ease incurred in the service.
THREW AT ROOSEVELT TRAIN.
Deadly Chunk of Iron Hurled Into Car
In Quaker City.
Some unknown person hurled a
heavy iron plumbbob through the win
dow of one of the cars of President
lloosevelt's special train on the run
from Princeton to Washington.
The missile, which was thrown with
terrific force, crashed through the
Gothic stained glass transom on a
window of the combination car and
fell at the feet of Major Webb Hayes,
a son of the late President R. B.
Hayes, who was a guest of the presi
dent on the trip to the army and
navy football game.
Fragments of the broken glass fell
upon Major Hayes, who was sitting
with his back to the window, but
did not injure him.

CONGRESS RESUMED
MONDAY'S SESSION BEGINNING OF
MOST IMPORTANT MEETING.
Message Tuesday?— Preliminary Work
Only Will Occupy Attention for a
Week—New Senators Appear—ln
Upper House There Will Be Four
to Take the Oath.
Very little besides the organization
of the house will be accomplished the
first week of the session, although it
is possible that an emergency appro
priation for the Panama canal may
be passed the last of the week. Un
til the committees are appointed such
a bill would have to be considered by
unanimous consent or under a special
order.
The leaders of the house have been
informed that the emergency appropri
ation will not be needed until Decem
ber 25, and consequently the bill may
not be passed until next week.
Monday was taken up with the elec
tion of a speaker and other house of
ficers. It is already understood that
the rules of the last house will be
adopted, as the members have been
sworn in. The biennial lottery for
seats was an interesting occasion on
the first day, and at its conclusion ad
journment followed. Tuesday was de
voted to the reading of the president's
message, and that closed the real busi
ness of the house for the week.
Speaker Cannon has not yet com
pleted his committees, but it is expect
ed he win be ready to announce them
early in the session.
Bills will be Introduced every day
that the house is in session from the
beginning, and will be printed and re
ferred to the committees when ap
pointed. It is expected that many im
portant propositions will be presented
during the early days of the session.
Work in Senate.
Nothing but preliminary work will
engross the attention of the senate
this first week of the session. The
senate is already organized, as it is a
continuous body, and besides, there
was a special session last spring,
when the new senators were sworn in.
Senators Brandegee of Connecticut,
Warner of Missouri, Frazier of Ten
nessee and LaFollette of Wisconsin
have not yet taken their oaths. The
two former had not been elected when
the special session adjourned.
Monday was a very short session
and the senate adjourned out of re
spect for the late Senator Piatt of Con
necticut as soon as the necessary for
malities for the beginning of a new
congress have been concluded. Tues
day the president's message was re
ceived and read, and Wednesday was
devoted to the introduction of bills. A
short session was held Thursday, and
the senate then adjourned until the
following Monday.
MILLIONS SPENT IN ELECTIONS.
Immense Sums Spent During Presi
dential Campaigns.
The Washington Post prints under a
New York date what is declared to be
an authoritative statement of the cam
paign fund raised by the republican
national committee during the last
presidential canvass and the manner
of its distribution.
The statement shows an approxi
mate aggregate of 11,900,000 was rais
ed and expended.
The figures for the McKinley cam
paign of 1900 are given as $2,800,0000
and for 1896 as $3,800,000.
The sum expended by the demo
cratic national committee for the elec
tion of Mr. Cleveland in 1892 is placed
at $4,100,000.
The article says about 1000 in
dividuals contributed to the last re
publican campaign, of which 40 per
cent disclosed their identity and 60
per cent were unknown.
The largest individual contribution
was $75,000 or $100,000, the funds be
ing turned in by a member working
on one of Treasurer Bliss' committees,
who did not know who furnished the
money.
IN DARK AS TO MOSCOW.
Last News From There Is of Pillage
and Arson.
Berlin, Dec. s.—Absence of news
from Moscow leads to the worst con
clusions in respect to that city's fate.
The latest information was that the
old capital was in the hands of mobs
that sacked and burned all the gov
ernment buildings, and the police and
Cossacks pillaged the imperial gran
eries and cut the telegraph wires. It
is evident the last line of communica
tion was severed at least 24 hours ago
and that Moscow is isolated, not only
from the world, but from the remain
der of Russia.
Disarm Naval Battalions.
St. Petersburg, Dec. s.—The most
elaborate precautions have been tak
en against a feared outbreak by the
troops as a result of the Sjebastopol
mutiny. The naval battalions have
been completely won over by the
revolutionaries and are almost beyond
control. They have been deprived of
their arms.

Saturday was probably one of the

the season. The 25,000 people saw
the game. From all sections of the
United States came spectators who or
dinarily would not travel a score of
miles to see a football contest. All
this was doubtless brought about by
the fact that President Roosevelt was
to be present.

EIGHTEENMETDEATH
EXFLOSION IN COAL MINE NEAR
DIAHSNDVILLE, WYO.
Rescuers Are Driven Back —Shock Is
Felt All Over Town, Violently Rock
ing Buildings—Victims Are instantly
Killed—Pathetic Scenes at the Shaft
—Explosion 1100 Feet Underground.
Diamondville, Wyo., Dec. 4.—Eight
een miners lost their lives by an ex
plosion in the Diamond Coal & Coke
company's mine No. 1. It is believed
that all the men who perished were
instantly killed. What caused the dis
aster is not definitely known, but the
theory advanced by the miners is that
a "blown out" shot caused dust explo
sion, which wrecked the mine. The
explosion was felt all over the town,
rocking buildings so violently that the
occupants ran out into the open. The
news that there had been another dis
aster at the Diamond mine —the sec
ond in less tnan five years—spread
through the village, and practically
the whole population of Diamondville
flocked to the mine shaft. In the pre
vious explosion, which occurred Feb
ruary 26, 1901, 32 miners perished.
Wives and children of the entombed
miners were among those who rushed
to the shaft, and the scenes there were
most patnetic. The men were ready
to enter the shaft. It was impossible
to do so, owing to the after effects
of the explosion, and Superintendent
Sneddon insisted that all precautions
against fire should be taken.
The explosion occurred 1100 feet
underground and at least 3000 feet
from the mouth of the shaft.
The 800 coal diggers of the Diamond
mines were assisted in rescue work
by many miners who came over from
Kemmerer, a .ew miles distant.
Bv«y man in the mine perished.
The night force was small, their work
being limited to knocking down coal
to be taken ©ut by the day shift. Had
the explosion occurred in daytime, the
loss of life would have been far
greater.
The Diamond Coal & Coke company
is a Salt Lake concern. The out
put of the mine is largely shipped to
Salt Lake City and the smelters at
Anaconda, Mont.
Many English miners, who came di
rect to the mines from England, are
employed in Diamondville, and it is
believed tnat a majority of the dead
are Englishmen.
