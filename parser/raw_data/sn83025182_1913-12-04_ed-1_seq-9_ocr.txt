Christmas Diamonds
Reasonably Priced
The fascination of diamonds lies in tfieir
wonderful brilliancy and fire. These qualities
reach their highest degree in stones which
are perfectly cut, free from flaws and pure in
color.
Careful and expert buying has placed all
Ayres & Chapman diamonds in this class so
that they have become a standard of high
quality.
To obtain the most beautiful stone pos
sible at the sum you wish to spend requires
a serious consideration of the Ayres & Chap
man stock of fine precious stones, because
importing our diamonds direct from {he cut-,
ters we obtain special cash discounts impos-'
sible to smaller dealers, the advantage of
which we pass on in our prices to you.

Judge Robsrt. Sloan of Keosauqua
arrived this morning and tills after
noon began the hearing In the case
of the Iowa Telephone company
against the city of Keokuk. Judge
Sloan Is the special master appointed
by Judg3 Smith MoPherson to hear
the litigation.
Just how long the case will con
tinue is a matter of guess work.
Judge Sloan said this morning that
he might be here a week or it might
take a month in order to hear all of
the evidence and arguments which are
to be presented.
It is understood that there will be
several witnesses to be examined In
regard to certain testimony and then
the attorneys will argue the points
of law which are coming up in the
litigation.
The case is that which has come
•up over the matter of telephone rate3
in the city of Ksokuk and the fate of
an ordinance which was proposed by
the Initiative will be decided when
the final disposition is made of the
•case. The telephone company has
secured an injunction against the
city's enforcing the new rates wh'ch
were proposed in the case, and as
this injunction has expired it is a
question of whether a permanent re
straining order shall be made.
The case was called up"at the last
reglar term of the federal court, and
a special master was asked' for.
Judge McPherson named Judge Sloan
to hear It. The hearing was to have
come up Nov. 24, but was postponed.
Judge Sloan is already to hear the
case and this morning was going
over the pleadings in the matter.
The hearing will be held in th=
judge's chambers in the federal budd
ing.

T. A. Craig, city attorney, and Major
W. B. and H. R. Collins, special at

for the community Christmas tree as
outlined at the meeting is tnat it
shall be a large evergreen or fir tree
set in an open square and lignted with
electricity. The tree is not to be for
the enjoyment of Mie class -of citi
zens more than another but it, shall
be for all the city, youiig and old.
Because of the many church enter
tainments on Christmas eve it was de
cided that the tree shall be lighted on
Christmas day
there shall be Christmas songs and It
Is believed that all the people will be
glad to come together in this way as
one great family. In some cities it Is
planned to have groups of children go
from one street to another and where
