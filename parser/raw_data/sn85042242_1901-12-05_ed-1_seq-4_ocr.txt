Reading of the Message Attracted a
Large Crowd In the Htuise.
Washington, Dec- 4 —There was a
•ery good attendance in the galleries
of the house to listen tx (the reading
ot the first message of President
Roosevelt. The members gathered
early, chatting and discussing pros­
pective legislation. The mafin topic
was the personality of the new presi­
dent. Keen interest was manifested
in what he would have to s%y in his
message.
As the hamids of the clock pointed to
12 Speaker Henderson called the
house to order. The speaker announc­
ed the appointment of the committee
on rules as Collows: Mr. He--lenson
of Iowa, Mr. Dalzell of Pennsylvania,
Mr. Grosvenor of Ohio, Mr. Richardson
of Tennessee amd Mr. Underwood of
Alabama.
The only change in the committee
was the substitution of Mr. Underwood
for Mr. Bailey of Texas, who is now a
member of the senate. Mr. Bingham
(Pa.), at the head of the committee
appointed to wait upon the president,
reported that t.h^ committee accom­
panied by a like committee from the
senate had performed its duty and tko
president had received the message
with pleasure and had said he would
at once communicate with the two
houses in writing. Two minutes later
Major Pruden, assistant secretary of
the president, appeared at the main en­
trance and announced a message from
the president. The message was taken
to the speaker's desk, where Speakoi
Henderson broke the seal.
"A message from the president
the United States," he said, as he
handed the document to the reading
clerk and directed him to read it. Or­
dinarily presidential messages at the
opening of congress are listened to in
a perfunctionary fashion, but through­
out the reading the keenest interest
was manifested Hardly a member
left'his seat until the reading was con­
cluded.
The reading of the message was con­
cluded in the house at 2:35. Mr. Gros­
venor then offered the following reso­
lution, which was adopted:
"Resolved, Thiat a committee of one
member from each state represented
In this house, be appointed on the part
of the house to join such committee
as may be appointed on the part of the
senate to consider and report by what
token of respect and affection it may
be proper for the congress of the Unit­
ed States to express the deep sensibil­
ity of the nation to the tragic death of
the late president, William McKinley,
and that so much of the message of
the president as relates to that deplor­
able event be referred to such com­
mittee."
In pursuance of the terms of the res­
olution tfhe speaker appointed a com­
mittee consisting of one member from
each state ami territory.
The house then, as a further mark
of respect, adjourned.
A GOOD COUGH MEDICINE.
(Prom Gazette, Toowoomba, Australia)
I find Chamberlain's Cough Remedy
is an excellent medicine. I have been
suffering from a severe cough for the
last two months, and it has effected a
cure. I have great pleasure in recom­
mending it.—W. C. Wockner. This is
the opinion of one of our oldest and
most respected residents, and has been
voluntarily in good faith that others
may try the remedy and be benefitted,
as was Mr. Wockner. This remedy
is sold by Beardsley & Finney, drug­
gists.
Dolla.
The ivory doll of the Roman child
was too costly for the ages that follow­
ed the fall of the empire. For many
centuries dolls must have been chiefly
of home manufacture. The first shop
made dolls after the middle ages were
the jointed wooden dolls of the Nether­
lands. These were known in England
and in this country, too, in colonial
times as "Flanders babies."
If you would have an appetite like a
bear and a relish for your meals take
Chamberlain's Stomach and Liver
Tablets. They correct disorders of
the stomach and regulate the liver and
bowels. Price, 23 cents. Samples
free, at Beardsley & Finney's drug
store.
Stockholders Held Liabre.
Milwaukee, Dec. 4.—Judge Elliott,
in the circuit court, held that stock
holders in the defunct Commercial
hank, who signed an agreement to
make good any shortage there should
be in the assets and cash to cover H".
bilities to creditors and for stock, are
teld responsible for the payment to
the receiver of thalt bank of the sum
of $99,099.96.
Mayor Schilling Indicted.
Decatur, Ills., Dec. 4.—The grand
jury has returned an indictment
against Mayor Charles Schilling, charg
ing malfeasance in office. The indict­
ment was based on charges made by a
committee of citizens who allege thai
the mayor knowingly permitted gams'
bUng contrary to law.

KIDNEY TROUBLES.
Mrs. Louise M. Gibson Says
That This Fatal Disease is
Easily Cured by Lydia E.
Pinkham's Vegetable Com­
pound.
DEAB MBS. PINKHA-M :—I felt very
discouraged two years ago, I had suf­
fered so long with kidney troubles and
other complications, and had taken so
much medicine without relief that I
begun to think there was no hope for
me. Life looked so good to me, but
what is life without health I wanted
to be well.
MBS. LOUISE M. GIBSON.
"Lydia E. Pinkham's Vege­
table Compound cured me and made
me well, and that is why I gladly
write you this, and gladly thank you
six bottles was all I took, together
with your Pills. My headache and
backache and kidney trouble went,
never to return the burning sensation
had left altogether my general
health was so improved I felt as young
and light and happy as at twenty."
—MBS. LOUISE Grason, 4813 Langley
Ave., Chicago, IlL—$5000

FOOD CHANGED POISON.
Putrefying food in the intestines

poisons from clogged bowels, gently,
easily but surely, curing constipation,
biliousness, sick headache, fevers, all
liver, kidney and bowel trouhles. Only

SAW DEATH NEAR.

writes L. C, Overstreet, of Elgin,
Tenn., "to hear my wife cough until it
seemed her weak and sore lungs would
collapse. Good doctors said she was
so far gone with consumption that no
medicine or earthly help could save
her, but a friend recommended Dr.
King's New Discovery and persistent
use of this excellent medicine saved
her life." It's absolutely guaranteed
for coughs, colds, bronchitis, asthma,
and all throat and lung diseases. 50c

The Ozark is not a prospect, but a mine that has produced. We are placing
