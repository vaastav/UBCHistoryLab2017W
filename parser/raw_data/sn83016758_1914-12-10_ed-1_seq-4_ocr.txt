We all must admit that the Mexi
cans are truly persistent.
The Bull Moose may not be dead
but it surely is some imitation of a
corpse.
We now have the regular tax, the
income tax and the war tax. Let us
hope tnat a peace tax is not neces
sary.
The European war is another in
stance where an ounce of prevention
would have been worth a pound of
cure.
Level-headed members of the legis
lature will do considerable thinking
before they vote to abolish the board
of control.
This would be a good time to make
up your list of New Year's resolu
tions. Start the list with' a resolve
to abide by a few of your resolutions.
The open season for giving advice
anent Christmas shopping is now
here. However, as usual, the advice
will not be as freely accepted as
given.
I is estimated that over one
billion dollars will be appropriated
at the present session qf congress to
keep the wheels of government
moving.
"What will be the effect of almost
world wide war upon the world's
writers?" queries a contributor to
an eastern magazine. Let us hope it
will have a wholesome effect.
Even if the war correspondents
have killed ofi. more men than ever
participated in the European
flict there appears to be a
soldiers left in the battle lines.

That grand old veteran, Hon. C.
F. Macdonald, has annuonced that
he intends to make application for
the position of postmaster at St.
Cloud. He ought to get it by unan
imous consent.
President Vincent of the univer
sity held up to scorn the "fool arith
metic" used in many city and rural
schools. Some pupils undoubtedly
believe that Mr. Vincent should have
included all arithmetic.
At the meeting of the Northern
Minnesota Development association
held in Brainerd last week C.
Kelley of Menagha was elected presi
dent for the ensuing year. No better
selection could have been made.
A Minnesotan was recently relieved
of $10,000 by Chicago confidence men,
who used the venerable wire tapping
swindle game. And some crooks con
tinue to use the crude method of
force in separating coin of the realm
from gullible individuals
And now it is said that the day of
freak shows at state lairs is over.
The better class ot county fairs dis
pensed with this class of "attrac
tions' years ago, and it is pleasing
to note that the larger expositions
contemplate doing away with the
nuisances.
Frank Day in the Fairmont Sen
tinel truthfully says: "The greatest
nuisance in a community is a chronic
grouch." Usually those who are
loudest in lamenting over the "sorry
plight" of the city or village that
tolerates their presence cannot point
to a single act on their part that
tended to better conditions in any
manner.
Champ Clark, speaker of the house
of representatives, had to be led
from the platform while delivering
a lecture at Detroit, Michigan, last
week. His gestures were unstable
and halting, and his speech was none
too coherent. The speaker was in
vited to leave, but the invitation was
not accepted. Finally the lights were
extinguished and the rambling talk
was cut short, when Mr. Clark was
escorted from the hall. This in
cident might explain Speaker Clark's
asinine proposal a few years agq that
the United States annex Canada.
Two innocent men were held by
Minneapolis police five days on a
charge of burglary, and perhaps
would have been held yet had not
the real culprits confessed. Dangers
in that city appear to be on the in
crease. If you are not made the
victim of thugs, you are apt to be
arrested as a criminal.
Some of Chicago's policemen evi
dently thought that it was their
duty to protect swindlers instead of
the public, and several of them have
been indicted on "graft'' charges.
Numerous of the larger cities in
this country appear to be reeking
with corruption, and a few real
reformers are badJy needed.
The progresive national executive
committee had a conference at
Chicago last week, and decided to
stay in the fight. Another meeting
will be held next month to fix the
time and place of holding the na
tional convention of the party. Salt
Creek would be about as conveninet
a place for the convention as any.
One of the city papers announces
that legislation to carry into effect
the forestry amendment to the state
constitution is being planned by
William T. Cox, state forester. An
other commission, a horde of new
officeholders, including high-priced
experts, a soil survey and an appro
priation of $500,000! Fads come
high.
Despite the ease with which the
various rulers of the countries in
volved in the ghasty conflict that is
drenching Europe in blood, disclaim
responsibility for the monstrous
affair, there is no disputing the fact
that one of them is responsible. We
doubt if all the imps of hades can
devise a fitting punishment for the
wretch.
That one year of war in Europe
will add $500,000,000 to the foreign
commerce of the United States is the
estimate of Edward E. Pratt, chief
of the bureau of foreign and domes
tic commerce. Numeious other in
didviduals aie predicting an era of
prosperity for this nation, and it will
be accorded a hearty welcome when
it arrives.
A Chicago municipal judge, who
claims to have listened to 40,000 liars
in his time, recently awarded the
championship to a witness testifying
in his court. Inasmuch as the Du
luth News-Tribune and Duluth
Herald are in the throes of a bitter
circulation war, it might be a
matter of wisdom for one of these
excellent papers to secure the ser
vices of this fellow.
Congressman Fitzgerald, chairman
of the committee on appropriations,
fears that congress will not have
time enough to pass all the appropri
ation bills, and has served notice on
the Wilson administration that no
substantive legislation should be con
sidered at this session. The demo
cratic party, when in power, has
never been able to pass all of the ap
propriation bills in season, but it
usually passed enough to deplete the
treasury.
Chicago now boasts of a new "400"
list, and it is said to be the gayest
"400" Chicago has ever known.
Several well known packing and
grain millionaires have been lopped
off the list, and the names of numer
ous light weight tango cut-ups have
been substituted. If a cataclysm
were to open up and swallow the en
tire lot, the world would be no
poorer intellectually, and the egotis
tical nonentities would never be
missed.
Various articles are now being
written relative to the state of pre
paredness of this nation for war. I
is very evident that this nation is
none too well prepared that it is a
military cripple when compared to
the more powerful nations of the
world. In view of the fact that
statistics show that we expend
almost as much on our army as does
Germany or France, the inadequate
means of defense of this nation are
difficult to understand. A thorough
and systematic investigation of mili
tary expenditures, might cast some
light on the matter.
AN AUTOMOBILE LICENSE PEE.
Referring to the small license fee
paid on automobilesgp cents per
yearthe Stillwater Gazette re
marks
"Possibly some member of the
legislature may introduce a bill pro
viding for a tax of $5 per year on
every automobile and truck in the
state, the money to be used in the
improvement of the roads of Minne
sota.
Such a measure (House File 704)
was introduced by R. C. Dunn at
the 1913 session. The bill was made
a tax committee bill, and finally
passed the house on March 14 by a
vote of 69 to 36.
On March 19 the bill made its first
appearance in the senate and was
re$
ferred to the committee on roads and
bridges of which Senator Swanson
was chairman. On March 25 the bill
was reported back to the senate with
the recommendation that it do pass.
On the same day the bill was given
its second reading in the senate.
But that was the last of itit died
along with scores of other bills.
No doubt a bill similar to House
File 704 will be introduced at the
ensuing session and it should become
a law. Owners of automobiles should
be made to contribute toward the
upkeep of the*public highways. But
the license fee must be reasonable
and not in lieu of other taxes, other
wise the proceeds could not be
turned into the state road and
bridge fund.
A license fee of $5 would not be
unreasonable.
THE PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE.
There is nothing startling in the
president's message to congress. He
congratulates congress for the great
body of thoughtful and constructse
work which it has done in loyal re
sponse to the thought and needs of
the country.
One would gather from the presi
dent's remarks that he favors the
ouilding of a merchant marine by
the government, and he earnestly
recommends the passage of the ship
ping bill which was the subject of
much discussion at the last session.
We must confess that we are not
familiar with the provisions of
NO MORE APPOINTIVE OFFICIALS.
In discussing the legislation pro
posed by the efficiency and economy
commission to cheapen, simplify and
render more efficient the state gov
ernment, Prank Eddy, in the Saulj
Centre Herald, objects strenuously to
the creation of any more appointive
offices to be filled by theoretical,
high-salaried figure-heads and tersely
states his objections in these para
graphs
"We are strongly of the opinion
that not a single office now elective
should be made appointive. Indeed,
we chink that some of the appointive
positions that now exist should be
made elective. An appointive official
owes his allegiance to the appointive
power while an elective official owes
his to the people that elected him,
and if he does not remain true to,
that allegiance, the people have a
remedy within their own hands.
VlSor are we in favor of extending
the terms of the elective officials.
A faithful, competent, obliging
official has no trouble in setting re
elected, and if the official is unfaith
ful, incompetent and disobliging,
the sooner the people can get a
whack at him and jelegats him to

A larger measure of self govern
ment for the people of the Philip
pines is urged. But men who have
been in the Philippines and under
stand the situation seem to be of the
opinion that the Filipinos have
already about all the self government
that is good for them.
The necessity for a proper survey
and charting of the Alaska coast is set
foith. and greater economy in gov
ernment expenditures is dwelt on.
The president makes it clear that
he is opposed to a large standing
army, but he favors the strengthen
ing and developing of the national
guaid of the states.
With reference to the navy the
president expressed himself as being
in favor of a powerful navy, and, ap
parently, favors the building of more
war crafts when it is definitely de
termined what type will be the most
effective.
Nowhere in the message is there
the slightest reference to the affairs
of distracted Mexico.

public. I seems to us that during
the last few years public officials
have devoted more time and energy
to getting the tenure of their offices
extended and getting their salaries
increased than they have to the
duties they were elected to perform.
In every single case that a salary has
been increased or the term of an
office extended, it has always been
the result of official lobbying and
never in response to a demand on
the part of the people.
"Every effort looking toward in
creasing the power of officialdom and
lessening the power of the people
should be frowned down upon. There
are worse things than public extrav
agance there are worse things than
public wastefulness there are even
worse things than public corruption,
and one of them is the taking away
from the people the right of control
over the affairs of the people."
A man who casts his vote for Gor
don and then votes against county
option, proves beyond a doubt that
he is voting according to his honest
convictions and not from dictation.
-Walker Pilot.
By the same token cannot a mem
ber vote for Mr. Flowers and also
vote for county option? The Pilot
truly says that, "both Flowers and
Gordon are men well equipped to
preside over the next house." Then
why not elect a speaker on
his merits without dragging io
the question of county option?
County option, according to our way
of thinking, is being overworked in
the speakership contest.
F. J. Hickey, a life prisoner in
Sing Sing prison, has offered him
self as a sacrifice for inoculation with
cancer germs to ascertain whether
the disease is contagious in the hope
that sufferers therefrom will be ben
efited. Hickey was convicted of a
murder committed under revolting
circumstances, and his action at this
time demonstrates that no man is
so degraded but what some goodness
exists in him.
The convention of the Northern
Minnesota .Development association
at Brainerd last we,ek was more than
successful. The association has done
much for northern Minnesota and
the good work is being continued
gratifying results.

Senators and represenatatives in
congress have for years abused the
franking privilege. This week we re
ceived through the mails a printed
copy of a speech deliveied at St.
Louis, Missouri, a couple of months
ago by Rome G. Brown on judicial
recall. I went through the mails
free on Senator McCumber's frank.
Considerable economy could be
practiced in the postal department
without impairing in the least the
efficiency of the service. Tons of
literature are sent through the mail
every year on which no postage is
paid. If this waste were eliminated
it might be possible for the govern
ment to exist without competing
with printers in punting leturn
cards on envelopes.
If so soon we aie to be done for,
what under heaven were we ever
begun for? If the United States was
to sneak out of Vera Cruz leaving it
a prey to the first to grab it, why
under heaven did this country ever
take forcible possession? Drluth

President Wilson and Secretary
Bryan may have a Mexican policy
but we common mortals cannot com
prehend it. After all the "watchful
waiting" and palavering by special
go-betweens affairs are in a worse
condition in unhappy Mexico today
than at any time since Porfirio Diaz
vacated the throne.
European war news continues to
be extremely contradictory. One day
the Kussians have overwhelmed the
Germans and annihilated several
army corps, the next day the Ger
mans have routed the Muscovites
and captured 100,000 men. And so
it goes. There is one thing certain,
however, fighting is stiH in progress
and thousands of lives are being
sacrificed daily.
"It is not expenditure, but extrav
agance that we should fear being
criticized for, said President Wilson
in his message to congress. There is
considerable difference between the
two, although some individuals do
not realize it. A niggardly policy is
oftentimes more expensive than one
of extravagance. -*v.

From a close perusal of the
supreme ourt decision anent the
iron ore deposits under the waters
of navigable lakes and rivers, we
are inclined to believe that the court
does not favor the state's claims,
but at the same time does not
squarely hold for the riparian
owners To a layman the decision
is rather confusing.
AMERICAN NAVY IN
FINE FIGHTING TRIM
Army Field Guns Are as Good
as Any in the World.
Washington, Dec 9 Lessons drawn
from the European war were discuss
ed before the house military and naval
committees by Brigadier General Cro
zier, chief of ordnance of the army,
and Rear Admiral Badger of the
general staff
Brigadier General Crozier said the
United States never would have use
for guns similar to the great howitzers
with which the Germans demolished
Belgium's forts and asserted the
American field guns were as good as
any in the world.
Admiral Badger told the naval com
mittee that "ship for ship the United
States navy is equal to, if not better,
than that of Germany or any other
nation." Answering questions, the ad
miral gave his idea of why the Brit
ish navy is content to keep the Ger
man fleet "bottled up/' instead of
forcing an engagement.
FRENCH ARE NEAR R0ULERS
Gradually Advance Their Lines in
Flanking Movement.
Paris, Dec. 9By constant fighting
along the Pas Chendelle road the
French, operating from the south of
Ypres, have all but reached Roulers
in their flanking movement to cover
Menin, an important point on the
Yser.
Supported by the fire of the allied
guns the French have gradually ad
vanced their lines until they have
practically cleared the railroad and
have a straight path to Roulers.
Despite the vigorous attack being
made by the allied forces reports in
dicate that the Germans have not
abandoned their offensive at all points.
Heavy firing is reported along th
coast, with the Germans bombarding
t points east of Nieuport.
