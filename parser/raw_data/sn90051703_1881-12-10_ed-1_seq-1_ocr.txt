On the
Unfortunate Heads of ; the Witnesses
Against Him.
Clnltena Trial.
Washington, Dee. 9. The criminal1
court opened promptly at "ten and Dr.
McArthur again took the stand.
Guiteausaid, "your honor,'1.
; Scoville Keep still please. ' :
Guiteau Then 'you state it at once
if you don't I will.
Scoville then addressed the court and
objected to the character of the evi
dence which was being given' by the
witness, on the ground, that evidence
as to any other crimes could not be in
troduced, when the prisoner is on trial
for this particular offense. Ho desired
all such evidence striken out alto
gether. Guiteau here broke in excitedly and
shouted. "It is purely in the nature of
a confessional. McArthur, is not an
expert or lawyer, and I object to him
telling the jury and American people
facts which I told him years ago in re
gard to my history.
The court ruled that the evidence
could be admitted as tending to show
the character of the prisoner.
Corkhill Did you ever see anything
in the prisoner to indicate insanity?
Answer No sir, I never did.
Guiteau here broke in and proceeded
to express his opinion of Dr. McArthur
in terms not delicate. Turning to the
reporters table he declaimed for some
minutes against the scandelous report
of his character, and shook his fist at
them threateningly.
Scoville cross-examined the witness
and became very angry and much ex
cited at some of his replies.
The testimony in chief was not
shaken.
A. S.. CALDWELL,
the Physician who treated Guiteau
during his last illness never detected
any evidence of mental unsoundness.
CEO. A. PLUMER
was then called.
Guiteau "I owe this man twenty
dollars, but it has cost the government
two hundred to get him here. 1 think
the Presidents attention had better be
called to the way you are squandering
the government money. (To Corkhill)
He might bounce you at once. You
will cost the Government two or three
hundred thousand dollars at this rate.
Scoville desired the oourt to restrain
the prisoner, when Guiteau turned to
him and said: "You go slow, Cork
hill. You are spotted, and as soon as
this business is over the President will-
remove you."
The witness allowed the prisoner to
occupy a desk in his law office at Chi
cago for some months. He seemed to
have a deal of collecting business and
went in and out like a business man.
Guiteau continually interrupted and
finally the witness said to him, "it
seems that your close relations with
Diety of late, have corrupted your man
ners." The prisoner laughed heartily at this
sally, and said:
"Well, that's not bad for a western
man."
Did vou ever see anything in his con
duct that indicated unsoundness of
mind, was the next question.
No sir, nothing, lie seemed to be a
man of ability, vain and conceited, but
on ins card lie liad, "late from New
York," and we expected the rest.
This convulsed the court.
STEPHEN ENGLISH,
editor and proprietor of the Insurance
Tiniei, of iew York, took the stand.
Guiteau called out "this man was
in the Ludlow street tail, and I got him
out for $300."
The witness gave the circumstances
under which he became acquainted
with the prisoner.
Witness was in jail under $40,000
bonds, charged with libel. The prison
er aeteu as ins attorney.
Guiteau frequently interrupted the
witness, camng mm a iiar ana perjurer
ai one time ne snoutea, "mere isn t an
insurance man in New York that does
not know what a frand vou are."
Witness continued, the prisoner
swindled mo out of $300 and also
swindled many poor creatures in jail
by promising to help them by getting
their money and then never raising a
linger in their behalf.
Guiteau shouted at the witness
"Why, I would not spit on you on the
street, you old scouldrcl. I' 11 get some
insurance man to show you off right.''
ine witness was asked if ho ever de
tected any signs of insanity in the nris
oner and replied, on. the contrary he
was a remarkably clear headed.
shrewd lawyer. He completely outwitt
ed me.
WARREN G. BROWN, :
attorney at law in New York, was coun
sel ior Mrs. uuiteau in obtaining a di
vorce from the prisoner, believed the
latter perfectly sane.

what alj this kind of evidence has got
to ao witn tne real issue, wnojired the
shot and killed Garfield, the Deity or I.
I think it is devilish mean to rake up
my character in all its details. The
only issue here is who fired that shot,
the Deity or I. Just take that home,
Corkhill, and think it over till to-morrow
morning. I want to know what all
this has to do with the question of my
sanity or insanity on the 2d of July.
As I have told yon before, I had time to
go crazy a hundred times at intervals.
Recess.
I). MCLEAN
testified that Guiteau told him he was
bound to have some notirietysome how
or other. Ha might kill some big man,
or imitate Wilkes Booth.
At this the prisoner became very vio
lent and abusive.
District Attorney Where did that
conversation occur in which ho stated
ho intended to imitate Wilkes Booth.
Wittness In my office of course. . I
cannot fix the date.
Prisoner snarling at witness "No, of
course you cannot fix the date. I never
said so and 1 never thought so."
Witness The moment I beard of the
shooting of President Garfield
Mr. Scoville, interrupting Wait sir.
How long have you been a lawyer.
Prisoner "He is no lawyer. He is a
pettyfogger. He gets men about New
íork.to do all his jury business. Ho
has not got brains enough 'to try a case
before a jury. Patterson used to do all
his jury business. Shaw, used to be
around aud set Patterson to try all his
jury cases because ho did not have
brains enougn to do it ntrnieu.
District Attorney How did you re
gard him mentally?
W ltness l oia oot unnraiucn oi uim
mentally at that time. .
The prisoner continued to rail at the
witness "I have heard of your run
ning with women. My wife told me
once in Chicago that you went and vis
ited her. I am going to show you up,
wretch. You are a low dirty, puppy,
to come here and lie about me in that
way."
The court quite severe to the prison
erSilence, f
Prisoner "He had no right to come
here and lie about me, ., That would
make anybody mad."
Attorney What was his reply to your
remark about his being jianged.
Witness He said tnatT would be an
consideration and ho would get the no
toriety anyhow. -
Prisoner "I do not care a snap about
notoriety."
District Attorney In your conversa
tion with him did he say anything to
you about his being1 borii togeta living.
Witness Yes. , He said he was bound
to get a living' anyhow. " That the
world owed Mm a living and he would
get it. . .
CHARLES HOHLE,
a lawyer of New Yorfe city,, was then
called and testified to a number of
claims which the prisoner had collected
for one of his clients, when he declared
he would not give ten cents a bushel
for all the claims. Tne items collected
amounted to $385. '
Prisoner excitedly "Do you claim
that I collected those claims? Is that
your business, Mr. whatever your name
is?" . v,
The witness did not notice the inter
ruption. . ,.
"My client wanted me to see whether
or not I could get money for him, con
tinued the prisoner. "That was eight
years ago. You would not pay a hun
dred dollars and I would not deliver
them up."
The witness was constantly inter
rupted by the prisoner declaring his
testimony false. The witness consider
ed Guiteau a sharp, keen and rational
man.
Prisoner That wjis eight years ago.
It has a great deal to do with this case,
hasn't Hi (in ironical tone to the Dis
trict attorney.) "You produce those
notes," he shouted wildly, "or else get
off of that stand a disgraced man. If
you come to slobber over mo you must
produce those notes or show yourself
a liar." (To his sister, Mrs. Scoville,
who was endeavoring to restrain him).
"You keep quiet and mind your own
business, I don't want any more talk
from you in this case. "It makes me j
mad," he continued violently, "to think
the prosecution should attempt to ruin
my professional character when they
know it is a lie. It is a shame these
men, Corkhill and Porter, should slob
ber over my character. They have
been digging up my professional re
cord andthcy have not found anything
against me yet, and they can't. I was
straight in the law business, and I
want the American people to under
stand it. If there is anything against
me it is that I owe some board bills,
and that 1 committed adultery in order
to get rid of my wife.
Court Stormy, that will do.
Prisoner "I have got through now.
I have made my final speech on this
matter. It is a disgrace for Corkhill
being in this radency.
The prisontr while ho was delivering
this tirade was apparently under the
control of violent passion. His conduct
towards his sister was such that Sco
ville was obliged to make her change
seats' with him in order that he miglit
be as close as possible to the prisoner,
and try to regress his violence in the
cross-examination.
Question Did you ever have any
conversation with the prisoner on the
subject of relation? Answer No.
"No," echoed the prisoner contemp
tuously. "He is a Jew, and a dirty ono
at that."
The witness said he was not subpoe
nied. He came by a telegram from
Col. Gorkhill. I had written Judge
Porter about what I knew.
Scoville why did you write Judge
Porter?
Witness Because I thought it was
right on the part of anyone who knew
anything about the case to divulge it.
(Applause.)
Prisoner, countemptuously "You
did not know anything about it, you
miserable Jew."
Q. Have you expressed the opinion
of this man that he ought to be hang
ed? A. Not yet. (Laughter.) I came here
for the purpose of having justice done
him.
The next witness was
BENJAMIN HARRISON,
United States Senator from Indiana.
He testified that he had met tho prison
er a few times in various parts of the
country last year, and talked with him
and refused to help him get an office.
The witness saw nothing in the pris
oner's conduct or conversation that
called to his mind any questions about
his sanity. ?
Prisoner You are a good fellow. Sen
ator. I remember you Very well.
Court adjourned till Monday.
Failures.
New York, Dec. 9. Dun, Wiman &
Co., report failures for the past seven
days at 164, the largest number record
ed in any week during the year. Cf
theso the South, contributed 52; the
Western States, 42; the Eastern States

Eartner in both of the two latter

An Expiation.
Brussels, December 9. An explosion
occurred in the Cockrill colliery caus
ing the death of 60 persons.
Washington, Dec. 9. Keiferis devot
ing a greater part, of his time to the
preparation of a list of commissioners.
The work probabtv will not be com
pleted until the latter part of next week
or week after. It is not oxpected that
tho commissioners will be thoroughly
organized before holiday.
At the Cabinet meeting to-day all the
members except Kirkwood and Mac
Veagh were present. The session
lasted only an hour. -;
The question of organizing a better
form of government for Alaska, and
enforcing its original by the natives
was informally discussed.
The trouble with cow boys on the
Mexican border received attention
and it is believed that some action will
soon be taken to protect tho frontiers,
both of the United States and Mexico
from the depredations by this class of
marauders.
Another subject considered was the
establishment of telegraphic communi
cation between the United States,
Chili and Peru. An american compa
ny is making arrangements to that
end. This country could be given
such a telegraphic enterprise without
compromising tho rights of Chili or
Peru in their present complicated con
dition. Speaker Keifer said to-day that noth
ing had yet been done in regard to the
commission on chairman ship of the
House. The impression privails that
he will announce them next week, but
there is no authority from him for the
statement. It is thought very proba
bly, however, that in view of the ack
nowledged complications surrounding
the Utah case, the speaker will an
nounce the commission on elections on
Tuesday so that the contest may be
taken in hand by that committee with
.out delay.
George C. . Gorham to-day in the
Republican asserts that in an interview
with President Arthur this evening the
President explicitedly denied having
exposed the cause of Lewis for elec
tion to tho United States Senate from
Virginia in preference to Riddleberger.
The statement that he has done so was
made publicly by the friends of Lewis
in this city some of whom claimed they
he heard the President say that ho
thought a Republican should be elected
and that Lewis had better claims than
others as the Republican Senator.
In speaking of the Virginia Senatorial
contest to-day he said: I think a Rep
ublican ought to be elected, but Riddle
berger will get it. Mahone has
determined upon Riddleberger
and he will be elected. Mahone
is one of the most determined lighters
I ever saw. He didn't want us give up
the fight in the extra session over
Lynchburg for the Postmastership. He
insisted on going right head if it took
until December, but was satisfied I
think.
Senator Beck will next Tuesday call
up his resolution to instruct the Judici
ary Commissioners to examine the pro
visions of the Constitution and laws of
Congress relating to the death, resig
nation or inability of the Preisdent, and
report as to whether any further legis
lation is necessary, and will then make
a speeeeh on the subject.
Senator Edmunds says he sees no
reason why this Congress should not
get inrougn witn mis business and ad
journ by the 15th of May.
Senatorial Question In Virginia.
Washington, December 9. The Re
publican puplishes the following: Office
of the National Republican, Washinton,
December 9 Dear General, I had a con
versation with the President this even
ing in relation to the statement in to
day's Post and Mar, of this city, attri
buting to him certan views on the sen
atorial question in Virginia. In. those
statements he is represented as express
ing a wish for the defeat of Riddleber
ger. I learn from him that it is wholly
destitute of foundation. He was told it
had been so stated, and that he was
taking part in the matter in behalf of
Riddleberger. He merely states that
he has not interfered at all. He sug
gested that Lewis had a friendly talk
with him on the subject. The President
expressed no desire as to the. political
antecedents of the man who should Jje
elected, nor did he say one word which,
correctly stated, would in the slightest
degree embarrass, or call in question
your course. On the contrary, he do
sires it understood that he has no views,
which, in any manner, will conflict
with the friendly sentiments hitherto
expressed to you. Yours very truly,
Geo. C. Gorham, for Hon. W. Mahone.
Blaine's. Lanzar ge JW odlGed. .
Washington, Dec. 8. It is reported
that the President's message with refer
ence to tho South American Question.
does not read at all like the manuscript
furnished by Blaine, as his views of the
Department on the subject. It is the
habit of the heads of the deparments
to furnish the executive facts bearing
upon their branch of the service, for
the President's resume of the State of
the Union, and the consequent recom
mendations. It is understood that
Blaine, in transmitting the State Depart
ment recommeudations, had incorpor
ated language altogether too vigorous
for discrection, in regard to Chili and
Peru. The President quietly told his
own views of the proprietness of the
situation and modified the language to
a more calm cxpressisn, as observed in
the message.
Hunt t Remain In the Cabinet. .
Washington, Dec. 9. There is a re
port that Hunt will remain in the Cabi
net. One of Hunts closest friends says
the talk of the President to Hunt has
been of a character to retain him.
Hunt expects to remain. He said this
morning that the talk that he will cot
Bancroft Davis' place in the court of
claims is untrue, as he would not accept
it. He was offered the circuit judge
ship made vacant by the appointment
of Woods to the Supreme bench by
Garfield, before the latter was shot
and would not take it. The present in
dications are that Hunt will remain in
the Cabinet for a few months.
The Fated Train.
St. Louis, Dec. 9. The ill fated train

bridge, over tho Missouri river last

By schedule it crosses just before the
Warren accommodation meeting
the latter at Brotherton and
passing. Tho engine and tender,
thirteen cars loaded with live stock and
eighteen with other freight and the
caboose went down. Three of the six
men on the train when it started over
the bridge accompanied on that wild
leaf of fifty feet into the river channel.
That two of them escaped to tell of the
awful experience . seems a miracle.
One only is missing, Jack Kirkslcy, the
engineer, who stuck to his post.
Baratas of th Ktaff Theatre.
Vienna, Dec. 8. The Ring Theatre,
formerly the Comic Opera House,
where Sarah Bernhardt recently per
formed, took fire at seven o'clock to
night. The fire was caused by the full
of a lamp on the stage. The house
was tolerably full and the loss of life is

odies have been recovered. Many per
sons were iniured. Sixty were saved !
by means of ladders, and by jumping I
into cloths held beloW. A great effort
was ruado to save lives. The scene was
terrible, the flames shooting through
the roof and gutting the entire building.
It is probable the death list will be fully
four hundred. At one o'clock it was
discovered that the death roll was much
larger than at first named. By two
o'clock 240 bodies had been taken out.
It is thought that a hundred moro aro
still among the ruins. The reports up
to two olock were of the gallery
where ninety corpses were found in one
mass. The fourth gallery had not yet
been reached.
LATER.
270 bodies have been recovered from
the ruins. The fourth gallery has not
yet been explored. It is believed that
not a person escaped from that gallery
and very few from the third gallery.
The corpses last recovered are little
more than charred fragments. Gross
neglect is charged against the manage
ment of the theatre. The person in
charge of the iron curtain between the
stage and the auditorium appears to
have fled at the first alarm.
He Shot Ills Wife.
New York, Dec. 9. This morning
Pagnilli Tocuitto, aged twenty-one, an
Italian living at No. 56 Thompson

A railroad fight is certainly pending
in which the Atchinson, Topeka & San
ta J; e, the Denver Ss Kio urande and tne
Denver & New Orleans are more or less
interested. In the case the Denver &
Rio Grande builds south, which it is
preparing to do, it involves the dissolu
tion of the agreement existing between
that road and the A., T. & S. F. Even
if the new road is extended under the
auspices of a new corporation it will no
doubt be considered a sufficient pretext
on the part of the broad gauge to an
nul the contract. The Denver & New
Orleans road is interested in the issue
directly in case that road should choose
the mountain road to the sea board, or
in any way compete with tho roads for
trad o of Triaidad, Las '-Vegas, and
the Rio Grande River towns. The con
tract entered into between the A., T. &
S. I) . and the narrow guage two years
ago has worked incalculable harm to
Trinidad; it is advers to the interests and
development of the Southwest and con
trary to public policy and the sooner
broken the better. We invite railroads
the more the better but in order to
be beneficial they must come as inde
pendent lines and compete fairly and
squarely for the carying of trade for
our people, and not as monopolists.
We await the results of tho next few
weeks' railroad items with interest and
trust they will culminate in the exten
sion of the narrow gauge and also in
tho building of the main line or branch
of the D. & N. O. to this city. Trini

A New England Romance.
The moonbeams hung listlessly from
the heavens, as if they had no part or
lot in the destinies of mankind. The
cricket monotonously chirped his reci
taive, and the katydid added cheer to
tho evening by piping up her well
known solo. It was a lazy lazy even
ing, but Rosalind McGush was filled
with estatic joy chuck up to the chin.
For was not George Fitzalmode reclin
ing on the verandah by her side, and he
gazed wistfully and somewhat groping
ly into her eyes, ho murmured:
"Rosa, my dear, all nature, seems
to be in a quiet mood, on such a night
as this " . .
"Oh, George, don't stop to quote
Mr. Shakespeare. If there is any bur
den on your heart, drop it."
"And will you, Rosa, pick it up?"
And with bated breath he awaited his
fate.
"I Will, and carry it for you with tcn
derest love." There was a sound as of
the ripping of shingles off a barn, and
tho moon shone brighter, the cricket
Eut in a livlier chirp, and the katydid
opped on the veranda right under
their very faces and shouted her accu
sation in a yet higher key. New Haven
