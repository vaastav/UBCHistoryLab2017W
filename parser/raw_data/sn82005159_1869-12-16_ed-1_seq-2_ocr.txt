I ill PRBiIBMTSI VERSACE.
A curious hodge-podge, which com
mon courtesy compels the country to
call a President's message was promul
gated the other day. Unfortunate in
all his preceding official, political, and
li rary performances, since the day
of his inauguration, it was supposed
and hoped that Grant would, with the
a---tanee of his numerous Secretaries,
be able to meet public exigency, and
satisfy popular longing with an able
a d statesmanlike presentation of the
questions which must come before
this administration for decision. But
no reader can rise from a perusal of
the message without either a feeling of
disappointment or disgust- Instead ol
the brevity and terseness-which were
•<- ied. the document i- elaborate
Aothont being graceful in style or
phraseology, and expansive in ideas
a d -tateinents without any special
merit of detail or attractiveneas of
c n-truction.
Speaking of the message as we would
of the human frame, we would say
that its head was deficient in all the
-trongand conspicuous characteristics
which should distinguish so impor
tant a function ; lacking in the high,
-tatesmanlike and comprehensive tone
which -hculd pervade so impottanta
state paper: and unattended by any of
the peculiar features whose promulga
tion forces even unwilling admiration
and respect. The body of the message
would, from general characteristics,
appear to make several who are not
it- reputed author responsible for its
ci cation. No doubt Bout well patched
up the financial portion of it. Sumner
probably wrote the paragraphon the' Al
abama question' and foreign affairs.
The-Cuban mu m mery isclearly the work
of Fish, and Wilson or Butler may
havedictated the reconstruction portion
of it. The remainder of it bears
-:rong resemblance to Badeau's style.
The weak head of the document sur
mounts a weaker and nore unhealthy
body, which like that of a dwarf, is
contracted to deformity that shrivels
it into unshapely drivel and common
places.
There Is nothing in the message that
bespeaks the frankness or directness
of the soldier, nor the cogent reason
ir g and logical precision of tht -tales
man. Never in the history of the
country has been presented to a
President of this nation a more favorr-
ble opportunity to unite every taction
of his own party, and at least win the
respect and confidence of the opposi
tion, by the display of that broad and
earnest statesmanship, that compre
hensive grasp of intellect and far-see
ing penetration of mind that probes
deeper than mere words and soars
higher than mere statistics. But
Grant has clearly proved himself une
qual to the emergency. He approach
<•- the discussion of questions upon
the-oiution which even the nation's
fate may l>e involved, with the timid
ity, vacillation, and restraint which
a man feels who has no fixed opinions
of his own, ar.d is desirous of coocilia
tmg and harmonizing the broken fac
tions of a rapidly dissolving party.
There i- reveahd throughout the
Message a consciousness that Grant is
the Man and Congress the Master.
It is this subservient tone, thi- official
survility that disgusts everybody who
thought Grant had ome individuali
ty.
The most correct estimate of the val
ue and strength of the document may
best be formed by comparing it with
tie ine—ages of any of the later Pres
idtnts. We miss the profound and
logical reasoning of Van Buren, the
char and statesmanlike perspicuity of
Pierce, thesound argument and solidity
of expression of Buchanan, the ring-
ing eloquence and stately dignity of
Johnson, and even the original and
suggestive public utterances of Lin
coln. What was wisely conspicuous,
and to the nation of the profoundest
importance, in the state papers of the
later Presidents finds no exponant in
Grant —an earnest, ;sound, discrimina
ting and dignified public policy.—
There is no fixed policy defined in his
message—no =eukd plan of administra
tion. He proves by every statement,
by every sentence, that he is the mere
plaything of tougresr, subject to all
its caprices, its willing and subservi
ent tool.
But after all, il may have been fool
ish to expect more from a man who,
with tanning leather in Galena and
peddling wood on the Mississippi,
l>a.-sed forty-five years of his existence
in blissful ignorance of all questions
pertaining to public affairs. The
world i- full of men who are out of their
places, that is, the places which their
abilities peculiarly qualify thein to fill;
hut the country is to be congratula
ted on the fact that only one at a
i mc of this class can lie President.
ii would have been better for the
j fid more creditable to Grant,
in so far as the message i- a mere
literary performance if he had allow
led himself to be "interviewed" by
some smart, enterprising pres- re
porter, who, by a -eries of apt qoer
ies concerning public matters, would
have extracted from the President pre
cisely -ueh information as the people
desired. Such material, presented in
the piquant style and with the dili
cious pungency which characterize
most press report- now-a-days, would
have placed even-body iD good hu
mor with the Administration, and sa
ved Grant the unpleasant reflection
that he had made a most egregious
blunder in presenting to the country
an annual message that bad nothing
to recommend it, not even the poor
merit of being gracefully and smooth
ly written.
A WEDDING AT WOBILtTSi.
The marriage of M. Paul Geraud,
brother-in-law of the Portugese minis
ter, and Miss Marie B. Worm ley, the
daughter of the well known negro ca
terer in Washington, say- the Patriot,
is brilliantly described in the newspa-
pers of the party. Shakespeare tells
the story of Desdetnona's. love for Oth
ello. Brabantio, the father of the fair
maiden, absurdly declared that the
sooty Moor had used drugs and con
juration? to enchant his daughter.—
But Othello explained how he had won
the charming gir! of that period. He
had frequent invitations to the pater
nal abode, and told amazing -tories of
hi- imprisonment in the Anderson
ville- of hi- time, of hi? escapes, of his
Fort Fisher fights and all that sort of
thing, which the girl was foolish e
nough to believe. She was more fool
ish to marry him. The tragic ending
of that affair ha- prevented the exam
ple of Desdemona from finding many
imitations on the stage of rr-al life un-
til the present time.
This new love affair which has tilled
the ranks of the miscegenators with
encouragement and delight, has some
siight variations from the great dram
atic event to which we have referred.
One radical newspaper in recording
the marriage says that the father i- a
negro and the daughter an octoroon,
but that is slightly mixed. In this
case it was not drugs and magic whi;h
won the youth. Oysters and lobster
sauce did the business. Worm ley, be
it remembered, is the caterer who ju
diciously mingles dishes and diploma
cy. Wormley was on confidential
terms with Mr. Seward during the
time when that statesman presided
over our foreign affairs, and at present
is said to have exceedingly intimate
relation- with F*ish. When a Japanese,
Chinese or PortugeeseEmbassy, or oth
er outlandish delegation, is sent to this
country, it is immediately on its arri
val in Washington, put in charge of
Worm ley. No audience could be had
at the White House until the cuisine
of the great Wormley had been enjoy
ed. Here, under the inspiration of
Worm ley's wines, the embassadors
prepared for their diplomatic labor-.
It was here that Burlingame lodged
hi- Chinese delegation, and here the
Portuguese youth, the gentleGeraud,
met the lovely Marie. She it was who
bore to him daily on a tray the oysters
of Wormley, more delicious far than
any he had ever tasted in his own O
porto, and as he swallowed them
down, love rose triumphant in his
soul. When, at times, the memory of
the lonesome youth reverted to a vale
in his native land w here danced the
lovely maidens by moonlight beneath
the cork tree, it was Marie who brought
him to by popping a cork of the
Veuve Cliquot. If there sometimes
mingled with his morning dreams a
midnight serenade in Lisbon and a
damsel at the half-opened jalousies,
Marie with her soft announcement of
such fresh -had and mutton chops
as List-on never knew, would wake
him to a happy realization of the pres
ent. With such gastronomic bliss at
Worm ley's could love for the daugh
ter of the host fail to enter? The rad
j icals would fain record this event as a
great triumph of their teachings.
But it may be put down as a striking
i instance of the control which the stom
-1 ach has over the human affections.
NOT TRUE.— We have hitherto re
frained from noticing the unju-t and
unmanly attacks of the editor of the
Genius of Liberty upon Hon. B. F,
Meyers, of the GAZETTE and Patriot.
And all we have to say now is, that
when the editor of the Genius says
that Mr. Meyers was "lukewarm in
the senatorial content between Find
lay and Scull," in this district, he
either affirms whereof he know- not,
or he willfully and maliciously ut
ters what he knows to La* a falsehood.
—Somerset Democrat.
THE action of the Wyoming Territo
rial Legislature in relation to accidents
to employees on railroads is specially
commended to the attention of the
Legislature of Pennsylvania. Last
winter a bill was passed at Harrisburg,
and signed by Governor Geary, which
debarred employees from the right of
obtaiuing more than three thousand dol
lars for any accident that might befall
r jpa*
thetn on a railroad. The injustice of
such a law docs not need pointing oyt.
| The best commentary on it is the sub
{ stance of the following paragraph:
"The Wyoming Legislature has en
acted that "-any person or employee on
any railroad in this Territory who
may be injured or killed while in the
performanceoftheir duties or otherwise
-hall have the sam" right of action for
damage against -aid company a- if
such person were not an employee.' "

IK THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY DEAD?
Radical journals and stumpers for
some years have frequently announced
the death of the Democratic party.—
Let the reader calmly take a survey
of the field and he will ascertain the
facts in the case. Jsometbing that Rad
icals seldom deai in.
The States of New York, Pennsyl
vania, Ohio and Indiana, poll in round
numbers, say, the following votes:
Sew York 730 (>OO
. Pesnsrlvani* D04,M0
Obio 520.W0
Indiana 336 MO
Total.. 2 530 6W
This is nearly one half of the total
vote of the United Stab--, and it is
morc than two-fifths. Now, let us see
how it i- divided between the two
parties:
Dens CDR J Rett msj
New York 33.06<>
Pennsyivsni* 5.660

10-iics* ,'iu 18#5t 1,000
Total 33,000 13.500
Oem-eratie majority 19.500
It thus appear-, says the Cincinnati
Enquirer, in these great Common
wealths. which have more than one
third of the population of the Union,
that there are iSyjoo more Democrats
than Republicans. This is allowing
the majority they got in Indiana last
year, which they cannot get again.—
Had the *-tate voted this fall it would
have given us 10,0rtn majority. This
does not look as if the Democracy
were dead or in a dying condition.
A most vigorous and per-istent effort
is being made all over the Slate, as well
a in adjoining States, to secure the re
spite of Dr. Schceppe, now lying in the
jail of Cumberland county under the
sentence of death. If Governor Geary
re-i-t- these demonstrations and ap
peals he will be firmer in his convic
tions of Scheeppe's guilt than most
other persons. No case within our re
collection ha- elicited more marked
feeling of interest than this one of Dr.
Schceppe. The fact of the verdict
and sentence having drawn out the
most marked expressions of dis
sent from a great number of the ablest
physicians and chemists in the coun
try ought to induce Governor Geary
to grant the respite at least, if not to
pardon the prisoner.
FO\OR£SSIO\AL.
WASHINGTON, Dee. 8.
In the Senate yesterday, Mr. Sum
ner introduced a bill looking to a re
turn to specie payments It contains

FROM THE FEDERAL CAPITAL.
WASHINGTON, Dec. 9.
De-pairing of doing anything with
a tariff by a general bill, members
seem to be trying the tinkering pro
is—. and arc offering numerous bills
putting the tariff upon certain articles
and putting other-on the free list.—
They hope by this course to get matters
through that might be defeated if in
corporated in a general bill.

A number of the most prominent
physicians of the city have issued a

The money power of the country is
rapidly concentrating against the in
terests of the working classes. The
Cincinnati Enquirer says:
Thirty five years ago, in the days of
President Jackson, a National Bank,
with its capital of thirty-five millions
of dollars, was considered so formida
ble to popular liberty that all was put
down by the voice of the people. Now
we have seventeen hundred National
Banks, with a capital of three hundred
millions of dollars. Affiliated with
them are three hundred thousand bond
holders, who represent two thousand
millions of bonds. They have with
their five hundred millions of capital
invested in manufacturing, privileges
in New England which are sustained
by protection bonds from the Nation
al Treasury. To these are joined the
great railroad corporations—not only
the Pacific with its sixty millions of
dollars* aid from the Treasury, and its
host of branch roads, but such great
corporation as the New York and E
rie, New York Central and Pennsylva
nia Ceutral, which jointly control a
capital of two hundred millions of dol
lars.
Of the power of corruption and in
timidation possessed by these great ag
gregations of money, it is useless and
unnecessary to speak. We have for
years .seen them in our elections and in
our primary meetings, We have seen
them in the legislation of the country.
Everything it has done has been for
the wellbeiog of these privileged classes.
Whether the country will be able to
stop this monetary vassalage and as
sert its independence jn the future
remains to be seen. At present it is
the practical doctrine that only the
great moneyed classes have any right
to l>e heard and considered in legisla
tion.

SHOCKING PUNISHMENT IN CUBA. —
A letter received in New York from
Havana, under date of November 2Kb,
gives the details of the discovery of a
negro rising in Cuba, and the horrible
punishment which was indicted upon
those engaged in it. The letter tells
the following d >ubtful story :
"Throe of the number were shot, one
was flogged on three different occa
sions, receiving in all eight hundred
laches, and one of the best negroes on
the place, a vigorous man, was whip
ped almost to death ; and amid his suf
terings, while refloatedlv tainting and
falling to the ground from sheer weak
ness, vvtts made to declare what he
knew. Another, upon receiving the
order to lie down and submit to be
tied and receive punishment, fell sense
less. Nevertheless he received a
thousand lashes, without giving the
slightest sign of life. A creole negro,
suspected to be, though uot, implica
ted in the plot, received one thousand
two hundred lashe®. The handsof the
estates were collected together upon
the K-perauza, and there in the pres
ence of two thousand negroes, the ring
leaders of the conspiracy were flogged
in gangs of twenty-one at a time, two
executioners being detailed for each
victim. At the same place nine were
-hot, and in the punishment inflicted
no distinction was made between free
and slave.
We are in receipt of later and more
satisfactory intelligence of the safety

JohQ Stuart Mills is accepted in the
country by many as authority in polit
ical economy. In a recent letter in an
swer to some enquiries in relation to
Chinese emigration, he hold-the fol
lowing views:
"t onsidering the purely economical
view of the -übjeet, 1 entirely agree
with you ; and it could hardly be bet
ter stated and argued than it is in your
able article in the New York Tribune.
That the Chinese immigration, if it at
tains great dimensions, must be eco
nomically injurious *o the mass of the
present population ; that it mu-i di
minish their wages, and reduce them
to a lower state of physical comfort
aud well being, I have no manner of
doubt. Nothing can be more falla
cious than the attempts to make out
that thus to lower wages is the way to
raise thern, or that there is any com
pensation, in an economical point of
view, to those whose labor is displac
ed, or who are obliged to work for a
greatly reduced remuneration. On
general priciple this state of thing-,
were it -ure to continue, would justify
the exclusion of the immigrants on
the ground that, with their habits in
respect to population, only a tempora
ry good is done to the Chinese people
by admitting part of their surplus
numbers, while a permanent harm is
done in a more civilized and improved
portion of mankind.

to be taken at the same time They cleanse the

desh: the diseased matter ripens in the lungs,
and tae pitientoutgrows the disease and gtts
well. This is the only way to cure consumption
T these three me licines Dr J H Sebenck. of
Philadelphia.owes his unrivalled success in the
treatment of pulmonary consumption. The Pai
nt nic Syrup ripens ihe morbid matter in the
lungs, nature throws it off by aa easy expectora
lion, for when the phlegm or matter is ripe, a
slight cough will throw it off. and the patient has
re't and the lungs begin to heal
To do tni- the Seaweed Tonic and Manlrake
Pills must be freely used to cleause the stomach
and liver, so that the Pufmonie Syrup and the
food will make good blood
Schenck sM tndrake Pills act upon the liver,
removing all obstructions, relax the duets of the
gall-blalder, the bile starts freely, and the liver
is - >n relieved ; the stools will show what the
Pillsoan do : nothing has ever been invented ex
cept calomel a deadly poison which is very dan
gerous to use unless with great care), that will
unlock the gall-bladder and starts the secretions
of ihe liver like Schenck s Mandrake Pills
Liver Complaint is one of the most prominent
cau-es of Consumption.
Schenck's Seaweed Tonic is a gentle stimulant
and alterative, and the Alkali in the Seaweed,
which this preparation is made of. assists the
stomach to throw >ut the gastric juice to dissolve
the food with the Pulmonic Syrup and it is made
into good blood withoutferasentation or souring
in the stomach.
The great ressoti why physicians do not cure
consumption is. they try to do too much; thev
give medicine to stop the cough, to stop chills, to
stop night sweats, hectic fever, and by so doing
they derange the whole iigestive powers, locking
up the secretions, and eventually the patient
siuks and dies.
Dr.Schenck, in his treatment,does at try to
stop a c ugh. night sweats, chills, or fever Re
move the cause, and they will all stop of their
own accord No one oin be oured of Consump
tion, Liver Complaint, Dyspepsia, Cataarh, Can
ker, C Iterated Throat, unless the liver and stom
ach are made healthy.
If a person has Consumption, ofcourse thelung?
in some way are diseased, either tubercles, ah
scesses,bronebialirritation, pleura adhesion, or
the lungs are a mass of inflamicaiior. and fast de
caying In such eases what tauf be done ' It
is not only the lungs that are wasting, but it is
the whole ly iy the stomach and liverhavelost
their power to make blood out of food. Now the
only chance is to take Schenck's three medicines,
which will bring up a tone to the stomach, the
paiicnt will begin to w ant food, it wjjt digesteaai
ly and make good blood : then io patient begins
to gain in flesh, and soon as the body begins to
grow, the lt.ngicommence to heal up.and the pa.
tient gets fleshy and we!!. This is the onty way
to cure consumpt ion.
When there is no lung disease, and only Liver
Complaint and Dyspepsia, Sphepck s Seaweed
Tonie and Mandrake Pills are sufficient without
the Pulmonis Syrup Take the Mandrake Pills
freely in all billious complaints, as they are per
fectly harmless
Dr. Schenck, who has enjoyed uninterrupted
health for many years past and now weighs 225
pounds,was wasrei away to a mere skeleton, in
the very last stage of Pulmonary Consumption,
his phyioianshaving pronounced his case hope
less and abandoned him to his fate He was cured
by the aforesaid medicines, and since hisrecovcry
mmy thuj-ands similarly afflicted have used Dr.
Schenck ?preparations with tho same remarkable
success. Pull directions accompanying each,
