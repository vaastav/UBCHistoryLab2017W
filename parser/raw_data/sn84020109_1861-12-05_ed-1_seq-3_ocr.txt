'"it is not my purpose to review our discus
sers ith .foreign' States, because whatever
cHtbe their wishes cr dispositions, the in
teTitv of our country and the stability of our
govercmcct mainly depend not upon them,
tuti'pon tlie loyalty, patriotism, virtue aiid
ir.ielligcTjce of the "American people. The
curreM'ondence itself, with the usual reserva
tions, "is herewith submitted. I venture to
hope that it will appear that we have prac
ted prudence and liberality towaxd foreign
powers, averting causes of irritation, and with
rmnes maintaining our own rights and hon
or. Since however, it is apparent that here,
w in every other Sute, foreign dangers neces
rarially attend domestic difficulties, I recom
rier.d tl.at adequate and ample measure be
adopted for maintaining the public defences
cn every side. While under this general re
commendation, provisions for defending our
coast lite readily occurs to the mind. 1 also,
jn the fame connection, ask the attention of
Cor.Tcss to our great lakes and rivers. It is
kl'.evcd that some fortifications and depots of
arms and munitions, with harbor s.r.d naviga
tion improvements at well t-elected points up
on these, would be of great importance to the
rational defences and preservation. I ask at
tention to the views of the Secretary of War
expressed in hi report upon the Si.me general
question. "
I deem it of importance that the loyal re
pior.e of Eastern Tennessee and Western North
Caifllina should be connected with Kentucky
r-d other faithful part of the Union by rail
road. I therefore recommend, s a military
rneasuru, that Congress provide for the con
truction of Mich a road as speedily as possi
ble. Kentucky will no doubt co-operate, and
through her Legislature make the mo. judi
ciousselectiou of the line. Th l ;-.! tin ter
minus must connect with foms rr.t::g r.r.l
road, but whether the route el-i i1 fr :n
Lexington or Nicholasville to Ci u -eil.nd
Gap, or from Lebanon to the Tcni.c.-.-ve line,
in the direction of Knoxvtlle, or se ine J-till
different line, can easily be detr rmined. Ken
tucky stnd the geneaal government co-op ra
ting," the work can be completed in a very
hort time, and when done it will not only be
f.f vast present usefulness, but also an availa
ble permanent improvement, worth its cost in
til the future.
Komi treaties designed chiefly for the inter
est f commerce, and having no grave iK)litical
importance, have been negotiatea anc win dc
nhinitted to the Senate for their considera-
i:nn ililmnoh we have failed to induce
f of the commercial r-owers to adopt
desirable melioration for the rigor of maritime
war we have far removed all the obstacles
from the way of their humane reform, except
such as are merely of temporajy and acciden
tal occurrence.
Iinviu your attention to the correspondence
between Tier Britaulc Majesty'i; Minister ac
credited to this government, and the Secreta
ry of State in relation to the detention of the
British t.liip, Perthshire, in June last, by the
United States steamer. Massachusetts, for a
tupposad breach of the blockade. As this
detent.ien was occasioned by an obvious mis
apprehension of the facts, and as justice re-
CUliCS tliat We EUOUtU tuuiimi
ment, have been conducted with signal suc
cess. The patriotism of the people has placed
at the disposal pf the government the largo
means demanded by the public exigencies.
Much of the catioi-t;! loan has been" taken bv
citizens of the industrial classes, whos cotfi"
denc in their country's faith and real for
their country's deliverance from its present
peril, have induced them to contribute to the
support of the government the whole of their
limited acquisitions. This fact imposes pecu
liar obligations to economy in disbursement
an energy and action. The revenue from all
sources, including loans, for the fiscal year
ending on the.SOth of June, 1661, was $S6,
835,9uO,17, and the expenditures for the Karae
period, including payments on account cf the
public debt, were $84,578,034 34, leaving a
ba". lance in the treasury on the 1st of July of
$2.257,0C5 80 for the first quarter of the fi
nancial year ending the SOth of September,
1SG1. The receipts from all sources, inclu
ding the balance from July 1st, were $102,
oCii.ia 27, and the ex rinses' $&3,23'J,733t09
leaving a balance on the 1st of October, 1861,
of $4,202,706 18. Estimates for the remain
ing three quarters of the year, and for the fi
nancial year of 1SG2, together with his views
of the ways and means for meeting the de
mands contemplated by them, will be submit
ted to Congress by the Secretary of the Treas
ury. It is jrra'ilvirg to know the expenses'
made necessary by the rebellion are now be
yond the resource of the loyal peop'lp, and to
believe that the tame patriotism which has
thus far suttained the government will contin
ue to suain it until peace and Union shall
a t
ajraiu L.ei-s trie lami.
I res iecrfully refer to the report of the Sec
retary af War for information respecting the
numerical strength of the army, and for re
ct nimendalions having in view the increase
cf its efficiency, and the well-being of the va
rious branches of the service intrusted to his
care. It is cratih ins to know tliat the pat
riotism of the jeople is equal to the occasion,
and tharthe number of troojs tendered great
ly exceed the force which Congress author
ized me to call into the field. I refer with
pleasure to these portions of his report v.hich
maks allusion to the creditable degree of dis-
c'pline already attained by onr troops, and to
the excellent sanitary condition of the entire
army, i ne recommendation i.y the becreta
rjr for an organization of tke militia upon a
uniform basis is an object of vital importance
to the future safety of onr country, and is
commended to the serious attention of Con
gress. A large addition to the regular army,
in connection with the defection that has so
considerably diminished the number of its of
ficers, gives peculiar importance to his recom
mendation for Increasing the corns of Cadets
to the greatest capacity cf the Military Accad-emv.
liv mere omission, I presume, Congress has
failed to provide chaplins for the hospitals ac-
cupied by volunteers. This subject was bio't
to my notice, and I. was induced to draw up
the form of a letter, one copy of w hice, prop
erly addressed to each of the persons and at
dates respectively named and stated in a
schedule containing also the form of the let
ter, marked "A," and herewith transmitted.
These gentlemen, I understand, entered upon
the duties designated at the time respectively
designated in the schedule, and have labored
faithfully therein ever since. I therefore rec
ommend that they be compensated at the
same rate as chaplins in the army. I further
more suzirest that reneral provision be made
for chaplins to stive at hospitals as well as
with regime r.ts.
The report of the Secretary of the Navy
presents in detril the operationsof that branch
of the service, and the activity and energy
which has characterized its administration,
and the lesults of measures to ircrea its cf-J
ficiency and jovver. Such hav Itca the ad
ditions ly construction' ai.d ji.rhase ih"t ;t

fH-ria'. : ttei.tion to the recommendation of the
h. crelary of the Navy lor a riore perfect or
ganization of the navy, I y introducing addi
tional grades in the service. The present or
ganization is detective and unsatisfactory and
th suggestions snl milled ly the department
will, it is believed, if ri.i-.pted, obviate the
difficulties alluded to, promote harmony and
increase the efficiency of the navy.

Sou:: o:i t.ii return of peace, although I may
reir :T that to transler to the North, one

wi.'.d not, with reference to territory and
p ,'ulation, be unjust. During the long and
brilliant ju iical career of Jude McLean, his

therein cure than a nominal attendance; ri-
g in population from 147,000 in 1S31, to

demand of the owner of the vessel for her de
ten fion.
I repeat the recommendation of my pru.le
cessor in bis annual message to Congress, i-
December last, in regard to the disposition rf
lleeurplus which will probably remain ki tr
satisfying tba claims of American citizens n
gainst China, pursuant to the awards of ti
commissioners under -the act of the 31 of
March, 1856. If, however, it should 1 it be
deemed advisable to carry that recomn jr.d.i
tion into affect, I would suggest that aviorty
be given for investing the principal our 1
turpi us referred to, iu good securities, wit?
view to the satisfaction of such ci: cr j
claims of our eitizeno against China, as
not unlikely to arise hereafter, in tlecorr,e
cf our extensive trade with that li n.tira.

tern, and if uniformity was at ail intended,
j the system requires that all the States shall be
accommodated with Circuit Courts, attended
by Supreme Judges, while in faet, Wisconsin,
Minnesota, Iowa. Kansas, Florida, Texas,
CaiifoTiia and Oregon, have never had any
tut'h Courts. Nor can this be well remedied
without a change of the system, because the
.idilicgof Justices to the Supreme Court en
ough for the accommodation of all parts of
the country, without Circuit Courts, would 1
create a court altogether too dangerous for a
judicial body of any sort, and the evil of it is
one that will increase as new States come into
the Union. Circuit Courts are useful or they
are not useful. If useful no State should be
denied them ; if not useful no State should
have them. Let them be provided for all, or
abolished as to all. Three modifications oc
ur to me here, which 1 think w ould be an
improvement 11 pen the present system. Let
the Supreme Courts be of convenient number
in any event; then, first, let the whole coun
try be divided into circuits cf convenient size,
the Supreme Judges to serve iu a number of
them corrrsponding to the number, and inde
pendent Circuit Judges he provided for all the
rest; or secondly, the Supreme Judges bo re
lieved from circuit duties, and Circuit Judges
provided for all the circuits; or. thirdly, dis
jense with Cireuits altogether, leaving the ju
dicial functions wholly to the District Courts
and an independent Supreme Court.
I respectfully recommend to the considera
tion of Congress the present condition of the
Statute law w ith the hope that Congress will
be able to find an easy remedy for the many
inconver.ieaces and evils which constantly
embarra.-s thoe er-gnged in the practical ad
ministration cf them. Since the organization
of government. Congress has-enacted some five
thousand act and ioint resolutions, which fill
' more than six thousand closely" printed pages,
ui j and are scattered through many volumes.
Iu ; ynT rf tlipA ?rts have bepn drawn UP in
t rvste and without sufficient caution, so that
their provinces are often secure in thtmse'.ves,
or ia conflict with each other, or at least Q
t. e
doubtful as to render it very difficult 'or even
the best informed persor.3 to ascertain precise
ly what the statute law really is. It seems
to me very important that the. statute law
should be made as plaia and intelligible as
possible, and be reduced to as small a compass
as may consist with tho fullness and precificn
of the will of the legislature and the perspic
uity of its language. These well none would
I think, greatly facilitate the labors of those
whose duty it is te assist in the administration
of the laws, and would be a lasting benefit to
the people by placingbefore them in a more
accessible and intelligible form tbe laws which
so deeply concern their interests and their da
ties. I am informed by some, whose opinions
I respect, that all the acts of Congress now in
force and of permanent and general nature,
might be revised and rewritten ao ns to be
embraced in one volume, or at least tho vol
umes of ordinary atid convenient size, and I
respectfully recommend to Congress to con
sider the subject, and if my suggestion be ap
proved, to devise such a ptaa as to their wis
dom shall seem most proper for the .attain
ment of the enp proposed.
One of the unfauorabie consequence. of the
present insurrection is the entire suppression
in many places of all ordinary means of ad
ministering civil justice by; the ofiicers, and in
the forms of existing law. This is the case
whole cr in part, in all the insurgent States,
and as our armies advance ujon and U.ke pos
session of parts-of those States, the practical
evil becomes more apparent. There am no
courts or officers to whom the citizens of other
Sates may apply for the enforcement of their
lawful claims against citizens of the insurgent
States; and there is a vast amount of debt
constituting tuch claims. Some have estima
ted it as high as $20J,000,0tO due in large
part from insurgents in ojen rebellon, to loyal
citizens, who are eveu now making great sac
rigces in the discharge of their patriotic duty
to support the government.
Under these circumstances I have been ur
gently solicited'to institute, by military pow
er, courts to administer summary justice in
such cases. 1 have thus far declined to do it,
not because I have had any doubts that the
end proposed the collection of tho debt was
just and right iu itsel.f, but because I have
been unwilling to go beyond the pressure of
necessity in the unusual exercise of power;
but the powers of Congress, I suppose, are
equal to the anomalous, and therefore I refer
the whole matter to Congress, with the hope
that some plan may ba devised for the admin
istration of justice iu .all such parts of the in
surgeut States and'territories as may be un
der control of the government, whether by a
voluntary return to allegiance and order, or by
the power of our arms. This, however, is
not to be a permanent institution, but a tem
porary substitute, and to cease as soon as the
ordinary court can be re-established in peace.
It is important that some more convenient
means should be provided, if possible, for the
adjustment of claims against the government,
especially, in view of their increased number
by reason of tbe war. It is as much tho duty
of the government to render prompt justice
against itself iu favor of its citizens, as it is to
administrate the same between private indi
viduals. The investigation and adjudication
of all claims in their nature belonging to the
judicial department besides, it is apparent that
the attention of Congress will be more than
usually engaged for some time to coma with
great national questions, It was intended by
the organization ot the Court of Claims, main
ly to remove this branch of business from the
halls of Congress, but while the Court has
proved .to be an effective and valuable means
of investigation, it in a great degree fails to ef
fect the el jct of its creation for want of pow
er to make its judgements final. Fully aware
of the dili'Acy, not to say tho danger of the
subject, I commend to your careful considera
tion whether tho powerof making judgements
final may not be properly given to the court,
reserving the right of appeal on questions of
law to the Supreme Court, with such other
provisions as experience may have shown to
be necessdry.
I 5k attention to the report of the Tost-ma.-ter
General, the following being a sum
mary statement of the condition of the depart
ment. The revenue from all sources during
the fi.-cal year ending 20th June, 1861, inclu
ding the annual permanent appropriation of
$7v 0.000 for the transportation of mail matter
was $9,049,206 40, beirg about two per cent
less than the revenue of 18C0. The expend
itures were $13,6. 6,719 11, showing a decrease
of more than einht ier cent as compared ..ith
j-j A
those of tr.e previous; and leaving an. excess
of expenditures over the revenue of the last
ileal year of over $5,557,462 71. The,
gross revenue for the year ending June SOth
1863, is estimated at an increase of four per
cent on that of 1S61, making $8,6S3,009; to
which should be addtd the earnings of the
department for carrying free matter, viz; $700
OUO making $9,182,000. The expenditure
forlS63 are estimated at $12,525,000, leaving
an estimated deficiency of $3,345,000 to be
supplied from the Treasury, in addition to the
permanent appropriations.
The present insurrection bIiows, I think,
that the extension of this district across the
Potomac river at the time of escablishing the
river here, was eminently wise, and conse
quently that the relinquishment of that por
tion of it which :s in Virginia, was unwise
and dangerous. I submit for your consider
ation tbe expediency of regaining the orginal
bounduries through Degotiatiens with the
State of Virginia,
The report of the Secretary of the Interior
with the accompanying documents, exhibit
the condition of thfl s-everal branches of pub
lic business pertaining to that department.
The depressing influences of the insurrection
have been especially felt in the operations of
the Patent and General Land Office. The re
ceipts from tbe sales of public lands during
the last year, have exceeded the expenses
of our land system only about $200,000.
The sales hove been entirely suspended in
the Southern Staaes, while the interruption
of the business of the country, and the di
Aersion of large numbers of men from laber
to military service, has obstructed settlements
iu tho new States and Territories of the Lortb
west.
The receipts of the patent office have de
clined in nine months about on 9 hundred thou
sand dollars, rendering a large reduction of
the force employed necessoiy to make it self
sustaining. The demands upon the pension
Office will be largely increased by the insur
rection. Numerous applications lor pensions
based upon causalties of the present war, al
ready have been inaie. There is reason to
believe that many who are cow upon the
pension roll and in receipt of the bounty of
the Government: are iu the ranks of the in
surgent army or giving them aid and comfort.
The Secretary of the Interior has directed the
suspension of the payment of the pension of
such persons open proof of. their disloyolty.
I recommend that Congress authorize that of
ficer to cause tbe names of 6ucb persons to be
btricken from the pension rolls.
The relations cf the government with the
Icdan tribes have been lately disturbed by the
insurrection, especially in the Northern Su-
petintendencv, and in that of New Mexico.
Tne Indian .territory soutu 01 rwansas is iu
pessesson of insurgents from lexas and Ar
kanas. The agents of the United States,
appointed since tbe 4th of March for this su
perintendencv. have been urTable to reach
their posts, while those who were in office
iu office before that time have espoused the
insurrectionary cause, and armed to exercise
tbe rowers of agents, bv virtue cl cemmis
bions from the insurrectionists.
It has been stated in the public press that a
r-rri inn nf th lipen organized
j as a millitary force, and are atacbed to th
ment has r.o official information upon the
subject. Letters have been written to the
Ccmmis.-ioner of Indian Affairs by several
prominent chiefs, giving assurance of their
loyalty to the United States, and eipressiog
the wish for the presence ei the federal -troops
to protect them. It is believed that on the
repossession of tbe country by the federal
forces, the Indians will readily cease the hos
ti le demonstrations, and resume their former
relations with us.'
Agriculture, confessedly the largest inter
est of the nation, ba3nota department or a
bureau, but a clerkship only assigned to it in
the government While it is fuxtunate that
this great interest is so independant in its na
ture as not to have demanded and extorted
from the government, I respetfully ask Con
gress to consider whether something more
cannot be given vol untarily with general ad
vantage. Annual report exhibiting the con
dition Cf our .agriculture, commerce and man
ufactures, would present a fund of informa
tion of great practical value to the country.
While I make no suggestions a3 todetails'l
venture the opinion that an agricultural arid
statistical bureau might profitable be organ
ized. The excutionof the laws for the suppres
sion of the African slave trade, has been con
fided to the Department of the Interior. It
It is a subject of congratulation, that the
efforts which httve been made for the sup
pression of this inhuman traffic, have recent
ly been attended with unusual success. Five
vessels being fitted out for the slave trade,
have been seized and condemned. Two
masters engaged in the trade, and one per
son equipping the vessel as a slaver, have been
convicted and subjected to the penalty of fine
and imprisonment, and one captain, taking
up a cargo of Africans on board his vessel,
has been convicted of the highest grade of
olTence under cur laws, the punishment of
which is death.
The Territories of Colorado, Dakotah and
Nevada, crea'ed by the last Congress, have
been organized, and civil administration has
been inaugurated therein, under auspices es
pecially gratifying, when it is considered that
the leaven of treason was found existing in
some of these new countries when the fede
ral officers arrived there. The abundaut re
sources of tlies Territories with the securi
ty aud protection afforded by organized gov
ernment, will doubtless invite to tbem a large
immigration wheu peace shall restore the
business of the country to its accustomed
channels. I bubmit the resolution of the
territory of Colorado, which evinced the pa
triotic spiiirof the people of the Territory.
So far, the authority of the of the U S has
been uphe'd in all the Territories, as it is to
be hoped it will be in thr future. I com
mend their interests and defence to the en
lightened and generous care of Congress.
I recommend to the favorable consideration
of Congress the interests of the District of
Columbia. The insurrection has been the
cause of much Buffering and sacrifice to the
inhabitants, as they, have no representatives
in Congress, that body sbonld not o verlook
their just claims.
At your late session a joint resolution was
adopted authorizing the President to take tho
proper measures for facilitating a proper rep
resentation of the industrial interests of the
United States at the exhibition of tha.indus
try of all nations to be holden at London in
the year 1862. I regret to have been unable
to give personal attention to this subject a
subject at once so interesting iu itself and ex
tensively andjintri nsicallyjconnected with the
material prosperity of the world.
Through the Sec.etaries of State and Inte
rior, a plau or system has been devised and
partly matured, which will be laid before you
underaml by virtue of the act of Congress
entitled "An act to confiscate property used
for insurrectionary purposes," approved Aug.
6th- 1861. Legal claims of certain persons
to tho labor and service of certain other per
sons have become forfeited, and numbers of
the latter thus liberated are already depen
dent ou the United States, and must be prov
ided for in some way besides this. It is net
impossible that some of the States will pass
similar enactments for their own benefit re
spectvely, aud by the operations of which
persons of the same class will be thrown on
their owu disposal. In such cese I recom
mend that Congress provide for accepting
such persons from such States according to
to some mode of valuation in lieu pro tanto
of direct taxes, or upon some other plan to be
agreed on with such states respectively, that
such persons, on such acceptation by General
Government, be at once deemed free and that
1 .1 i r
in anv event steps 00 lanen lor colonizing
with classes, or the first one mentioned, if the
the othor shall not be brought into expedi-
dience in some place or plages iu a climate
congenial to them.
It miht be well to consider, too, whether
the free colored people of the United States
could not so far as individuals may desire, be
included in such colonization. To carry out
the plan of colonization may involve the ac
quisition of territory, and also the appropria-
tion of money beyond tliat to dc expendea in
the Territorial acquisition. Having practiced
the acquisitiou of Territory for nearly fifty
.1 a.: . r f i : . - : 1
years, ttio question 01 consiuuiiouai pur
to do so is no longer an open one w un us.
The power was first questioned by Mr. Jef
ferson, who, nowever, in me purcnase 01
Louisiana, yielded his scruples on the plea of
great expediency,
If it bo said that the only lecitiraate onject
of acquiring territory is to furnish homes for
white men, the measure etiects tne otject, lor
the emigration of colored men leaves" greater
room lor wnue men remaining or luwiug
here. Mr. Jefferson, however placed the im
portance of acquiring Louisiana more on po
litical and commercial grounds, than on pro
viding room for population, including the
appropriation of money with the acquisition
of Territory, does not the expediency amount
to absolute necessity, that without whicli tne
government Cannot be perpetuated. "
In considering the policy to be adopted to
suppress the insurrection, I have been anxious
and careiui mai tne mevnaoie conuici iur iui
purpose shall not degenerate iuto a violent
and remorseless revolutionary struggle. I,
therefere, have, in every case, thought prop
er to keep the integrity of the Union prom
inent, as the primary object of the contest on
our part, leaving all questions which are not
of vital military importance to the more de
liberate action of the Legislature.
In the exercise of my best discretion, I
have adhered to -the blockade of the forts
held by the insurgents, instead of putting in
force, by proclamation, the law of Congress
enacted at tbe late session for doting those
ports.
Also, obeying the dictates of prudence as
well as the" obligations of law, instead of
transcending 1 have adhered to the act of Con
gress to 4,confiscafe property used for insur
rectionary purposes." If a new law upon
the fame subject shall be passed, its proprie
ty will be duly considered. The Union must
be preserved :"and hence all disposable means
must be employed. We should not be in
haste to determine wbat?radical and extreme
measures which mav reach the loyal a3 well
as the disloyal are indispensable.
The inaugural address at the beginning of
the Administration, and the message to Con
gress at the late special session, are both de
voted to the domestic controversy out of
which the insurrection and civil war have
sprung. Nothing new occurs to add or sub
tract to or from the principles or general pur
poses stated and expressed in those docu-
ments.
The last ray cf hope for preserving tbe
Union peaceably cxp'irei at the assiult upon
j Ft Sumpt'or, aud a general review of what
has occurreo. sinca may r.ot bj unprotiiaole.
What was fearfully.uncert.ua then is much
better dtfined and more distinct row, and
the progress ef events is plainly m the right
direction. The insurgent confidently claim
ed a strong support from north of Mason and
Dixon's Line, and the frieuds of the Union
were'net (re from apprehensions ozi this one
point, Th;?; however, wis soon settled ou
the right sided.
South of the line, noble little Delaware
ledoi7rkt from the first. Murvland was
made to seem against tho-Union. Oar sol
diers were assaulted, bridges were burned,
and railroads torn up .within hec limit, and
were many days.'at one time, without the
ability to bring a single regiment overhersoil
til the capitcl. Now her bridges and rail
roads are repaired and opened tu the Govern
ment. She has already given seven regiments
ti the cause cf the Union, aud r.one to the
enemy, and her people, at a regular election,
have sustais-ed the Union by "a large majority,
and a larger aggregate vote than they ever be
fore gave to any candidate or any other ques
tion. - '
Kentucky, too. for some time in doubt, is
now, decidedly, I think, unchangeably rank
ed 0:1 the side of the Union.
Missouri is comparatively quijt, and I be
lieve cannot again bo oveirun by the insur
gents. - -
The three States Maryland, Kentucky and
Missouri, neither of which would promise a
single soldier at first, have now an aggregate
of not less than forty thousand in the field
for the Union, while of their citizen, cot one
third in number are among the insurgents,
and they of doubtful whereabouts and exis
tence. After a somewhat bloody strugglaof sev
eral montbi, winter closes upon the people of
the Western portion Virginia, leaving them
the masters of their owu country. An in
surgent force of about 1,500, for ninths dom
ineering tho narrow peninsular region constrtn
ting the counties of Accomac und Northamp
ton, and known ai the eastern shore of Vir
2inia, together with some contiguous parts of
Maryland, have laid down their arms, and
the people there have renewed their allegance
to, and accepted the p rotection of tha nation
al flag.
This leaves no armed insurrection north of
the Potomac, or ea6t of the Chesapeake. Also
we ebtained a fooling at each of tho insulated
points of the Southern coast, of liat'.eras, Pt.
lloyal, Tybee Island, near Savannah, and of
Ship Island, and we likewise hav some gen
eral accounts of popular movements in be
half of the Union in North Carolina and Ten
nessee. Tkeso things demonstrate that the
cause of the Uuion is advancing steadily to
wards the south.
Since your last adjournment, Lieutetiant
General Scott has retired from the head of
the, army. During his long life tne uation
has not been unmiiiuful of his merit, vtal.
ling to mind how faithfully, how n-obly, and
brilliantly he has served the country lrom a
time far back in our history wheu few of the
now living had been born, and thence for
ward continually, 1 cannot but think that we
are still his debtors, I submit, therefore, for
your consideration is due to him and ourselve
as a grateful people.
With the retirement of Gen. Scott, came
the executive duty of appointing iu his
stead a General-iti-Chief of the army. It is
a fortunate circumstance, that neither in coun
cil cor country, was there, so far aa l learn,
any difference of opinion as to the proper per
son to be selected. The retiring chief repeat
edly expressed his judgment iu favor of
Gen. McClullan for tho position, and in this
the nation seemed to give a unanimous con
currence. Tho designation of General Mc
Clellan. is, therefore; in a .considerable de
cree, the selection of the country, as well as
of the Executive, aud hence there is better
reason to hope there will be given - bun the
confidence and cordial support, thus by fair
implication proraised. aud without which he
cannot, with so full efficiency, sere the
country.
It has been said that one bad General is
better than two good ones, and the saying is
true, if taken to mean that au army is better
directed by a single mind, though inferior,
than by two superior ones at variance and
cross purposes; and the -same is true in all
joint operations wherein those engaged can
have none but a common ena in view, ana
can differ only as to the choice of means.
In a storm at sea no one can wish -the ship
to sink, and rot unfrequently all go down
together because too many will direct, and no
single will can be allowed the exclusive con
trol. ;
It continues to develope that the insurrec
tion is largely if not exclusively a war upon
the first poinciples of popular government
and the rights of the people. Conclusive ev
idence of this is found in the most grave and
maturely considered public documents as wtll
as in the general tone of the insurgents. In
these documents we find the abridgement of
the existing right of suffrage and the denial
to the people of the right to participate in
the election of public officers except the leg
islative body, advocated with labored argu
ments to prove that large control of the gov
ernment in the people, is the source of all
political evil; monarchy itelfiseven some
times hinted at as a positive refuge from the
powerof the people. In my present position
I could scarcely bo justified were 1 to omit
raising a warning voice against this approach
of returning despotism, It is not reeded nor
fitting here that a general argument sbonld
be made in favor of popular institutions, but
there is one point, with its . connections, not
so hackneyed as most others, to which I ask
a brief attention. It is the effort to place cap
ital on an equal footing with, if cot above,
labor in the structure of Government. It is
assumed that labor is available only in con
nection with capital, that nobody labors un
less somebody else owning capital somehow
by the. means of it induces him to labor.
This assumed, it is next considered whether
it is best that capital shall hire laborers and
induce them to work by their own consent,
or buy them awd drive them to it without con
sent. Having proceeded so far, it is natural
ly conceded that all laborers are either hired
laborers, or what we call slaves, and further,
it is assumed that whoever is once a hired la
borer is fixed in the condition for life.
Now, there is no such relation between
capital and labor, 'as assumed, nor is there
any such a thing as a freman being fixed for
liie in the condition of a hired laborer. Botb
of these assumptions are false, and all infer
ences from them are groundless. Labor is
prior to and independant of capital. Capi
tal is only the fruit of labor, and could never
have existed if labor had not existed first
Lalorislhe Etiperk-rof capital and deserves
much the higher consideration. Oapital hs
its rights which are as worthy of Considera
tion. Capital has its rights, which are as
worthy of protection as any other rights, nor
is it denied that there is, and probably al
ways will be, a relation between labor and cap
ital" producing mutual benefits. The erroris
in assuming tliat the whole laber of commu
rnunity exisis within tiuit. relation. A' few
men own capital and that frv avoid labor,
and with their capital hire or buy a few to
labor for for them: A large majority belong
to neither class neither work for others nor
1 -.t 1 .1 T.. if

! the Southern States a majority of the whole
I people, cf all colors, are neitlier slaves nor
masters, whle in the Northern btates a large
maioritv p.re neither hirers nor tired men,

shops; taking the whole product tr them
selvM, an. I aildrg r.o favors of capital on
ono band, nor of hired laborers r.or slaves on
the other. Thetfo U r.o necessity for the for
the free hired laborer bing fixed for thut con
ditio u for life- Many independent-men ova-
where iu thosd States' a tow jevs t ic. in
their lives, were hired laborers. The irudent
penniless beggar in tha world labors for wag
es for awhile, and saves a surplus, with which
to buy tools or land for himself, and then
labors on his o wn account, aud ,at length he
hires nnother new. beginner to help him. -No
men are more ty be trusted, than than
those ho toil up cr from poverty, cone les
less inclined to take or tQufh auht which
they have nut honestly earned. Let them
be aware of surrenoering a political power
which thev already possesses, and which if
surrendered, will most surely bo used
to close the advancement against such as they
and to fix new disabilities and burdens upop
them till all of liberty is lost
From the firs: taking of our national cen
sus to the last, are seventy years, and we
find our population at the end of that jriod
eight times as great as it was in tha begin
ning. 'The increase of those ether things
which-nan dieoi desirable, Ins been eveu
greater. We thus have at one view what the
popular principles applied - to government
through the machinery of the States and th
Union has produced in a given time, and al
so what if fbmly maintained it promises in
future. There arj already many among us
who, if the Union bs preserved, will live to
see it contain 250.000,000. The struggle of
of to-d.iv is Lot altofUiPr of to-dv; it is
for a v.ist future also. With a firm reliance
on Providence, all the more firm and earnest,
let us proceed in the great task which events
have devolved upon us.
