HALL OP FAME SELECTIONS.
This is an extremely good list. Until
the additional twenty-one names are
Selected it will be entirely safe to criti-
else the manner of selection. Whether
or not, the list of twenty-nine already
made, or the list of one-hundred and
fifty that our descendants will have the
J Opportunity of criticising, shall prove
acceptable in every particular, several
things are evident; first, that no possi
ble list will suit every one; second, that
!no possible list can be scientifically and
Unquestionably correct; third, that the
preparation and presentation of the list
are very decidedly aducational. The
judges themselves must have especially
realized how much ignorance there was
afloat in their own minds concerning
1 the specific services of many of the diS'
tinguished men and women whose
names they were asked to review; and
If they probRbly had to do some cram
Jtnfng for the occasion, what about the
etate of knowledge of ordinary mor
tals? It would seem that the tendency
will be rather to mistakes of exclusion
thanof inclusion, and that every name
. Krtll "repFe'stmt a distinguished reputa
iion and a career well wirth the con
Bideration of ingenuous youth. The
.Very existence of this beadroll of fame
'will pique curiosity and interest, and
bo the occasion of truly educational
arguments, in the university and out,
tor all time.
And this leads to the suggestion of a
query whether or not there might be a
.way of getting'at real "greatness" than
that adopted of allowing, for instance,
chief justices of states as much voice
In selecting scientists, author and art
lets, as in selecting lawyers, judges and
statesmen. A board of authors, for ex
ample, called upon to name a lit of
the moat Important literary men of the
.country who had died before 1S90, would
Hot have omitted Bryant and Poe. A
board of artists would probably not, in
the voting, have confused the position
tof really strong men in our early his
tory with much less important men who
achieved reputation during a rather
barren period, though it should lie not
ed that no mistake was made in ad
mitting the one artist (Stuart) who did
deceive the requisite number of votes.
J3ut, as we said, judgment must be sus
pended as to the plan of selection at
Jeast till the missing twenty-one have
been added to the first group. Decem

Bald a bird fancier of this city, "but
nothing queerer, I believe, than teach

.at present by a dealer in Philadelphia,
and as soon as I can get hold of the

being to fix certain foreign phrases in

teach his birds, groups several cages
about the mouth of the horn and sets
the thing going. It has an electric mo

Is nothing to distract the parots' aten

man told me that the plan proved a
perfect success, and the birds learned
their lesson in about one-tenth of the
time that is usually required to drill
anything into heir heads. Moreover,
they would pick up phrases twice the
ordinary length, and the monotonous

that several parrots that have never be

Why Many Weil-Known Wits Decline
Invitations of the Fashionable World
Persons of wealth and position in the
fashionable world, who invite clever,
all-round good fellows with a reputa
tion in the world of art, letters, or some
other calling, to attend formal dinners
in their homes are often disappointed
in their guests, says the New York
Telegiam. In other words, to use a
slang expression, the geniuses do not
deliver the goods expected of them in
the way of entertaining nd their hosts
afterward declare they have been great
ly over-rated-
The cause .tor all this is not always
due to the gufest, however, according to
a Well-known literary man, for at form
al dinners, with all the accompaniment
of liveried servants, it is often impossl
ble for a man to "jolly up," no matter
how clever he may be.
Up in New Rochelle, where there is a
colony of clever men, Including Freder
ick Remington, the artist; Tom Masson,
the writer; Francis Wilson, the corn
median; George B. Mallon, editor and
writer, and others of that ilk, society
Is of a different shade, and no one up
there votes any dinner a bore.
Of course, none of these bright lights
would openly say that dinners given by
the ultra-frvshlonable set bored them,
for they receive many invitations to
dine in New York, and often get great
pleasure irom tnem, out at the same
time they frequently find it lnconven
lent to decline, "because New Rochelle
is so far away." Speaking for himself,
a well known literary man said the oth
er day:
"I hope to be delivered from many of
the dinners among the so-called swell
set this winter. Bohemlanism of a cer
tain kind grates upon the sensibility of
a refined man, but a little of that spir
it is a good thing for cehtain wealthy
entertainers to cultivate.
"A man cannot feel or act In any
thing but a frigid way when he is sur
rounded by obsequious butlers and arti
ficial ice bergs. The wealth and fash
ion are really not to blame always; it is
the persons who are such everlasting
.sticklers for stiffness and prnnrietv
that makes one think of funerals and
padded cells. For me, give me less
form and more good-fellowship."
ANTHONY CARROLL'S CHARGES.
Another Hearing Before the Special
Committee Last Night.
The special committee on the charges
preferred by Anthony Carroll against
City Engineer Kelly held another hear
ing last night and despite the storm
there was a large attendance to hear
the testimony and watch the proceed
ings. Mr. Nettleton, an employe of the
city engineering department, who was
on the stand when the last preceedlng
hearing adjourned was again called to
the stand at the opening of last night's
session. He was questioned by Mr.
Carroll concerning details of the work
on the Grove street pavement and
cross questioned by Attorney W. H.
Ely, who appears as counsel for Mr.
Kelly.
Mr. Gillette, another employe of the
engineering department, was called and
was questioned along the same lines as
was Mr. Nettleton. The hearing ad
journed at 10:45 and the next session
will be held next Tuesday evening.
POLICE AND FIRE BOARDS.
Regular Meetings Were Hold Last
Night.
Tne puijee cuiiiiuiabiuuiiib ana the lire
commissioners held meetings last night
but no business of special importance
was transacted. The police board dis
cus &ed some transfers in the accounts
cf their departments which they will
afk the board cf finance to make.
Among the transfers which will be ask
ed for is one of $150 from the heating
account. The superintendent's monthly
report was read and placed on file.
The fire commissioners signed the
usual batch of bills and held a brief
session.
Patrolman Phelps was to have been
placed on trial before the police board
last nicht on charges which have been
prepared against him, but he was ill
and the trial was postponed.
FAVORS NICARAGUA ROUTE

COHHISS ION.

Comparative Cost of the Panama
Canal Dlflioulty of Acquiring Rights
Over That Route.
Washington, Dec. 4. The report of
the Isthmian canal commission, submit
ted by the president to congress to-day,
gives a3 the unanimous conclusion of
that body that "the most practicable
and feasible route for an Isthmian ca
nal, under the control, management,
and ownership of the United States, is
known as the Nicaragua route." The
commission estimates the cost of this
route at ?200,DiO,UO3. This estimate is
much In excess of any heretofore made,
and is due to increased dimensions and
other features not heretofore consider
ed. The commission estimates the cost
of a canal by the Panama route at $142,
342,579, according to one route, or $156,
37S.25S according to another route. As
between the Nicaragua and Panama
routes the commission sums up a num
ber of advantages favorable to the for
mer. It states also that under the con
cession given by the Panama govern
ment to the Panama Canal company
that company is not free to grant the
necessary rights to the United States
except upon conditions made by the
company. Thexreport is a document of
about 17,000 words.
A detailed description is given of the
trip over the several routes. Along the
Nicaragua route, it was found that the
short section of partially constructed
canal ia perhaps in as good shape to
day as it was when the work was stop
ped. The buildings, however, are all
rotten, and the dredgers, boats, etc., are
worthless. The commission visited
President Zelaya and other leading of
ficers of Nicaragua, and found them
greatly interested in the project. The
occupation of their territory by the
United States for canal purposes did
not seem to be regarded as a serious ob
stacle, provided the sovereignty of the
republic was respected.
Along the Panama route the commis
sion found a large force of workmen
engaged upon the canal line, about 2,000
in number, according to the Panama
company. The canal had been opened
to some extent at both ends. Immense
quantities of machinery, implements
and tools were found along the route.
Much of this property, the commission
reports, is ill adapted to American
methods of work, and all of It Is now
from thirteen to twenty years old, so
that no value should be given to the
plant now on the isthmus. A visit was
also made to President Igleslas of Costa
Rica and his cabinet, and a strong sen
timent found" to exist for an American
canal along the Nicaragua route. Trips
were also made along the Darlen route.
THE COMMISSION'S CONCLUSIONS.
The final conclusion of the commis
sion are stated as follows:
(1). The estimated cost of building
the Nicaragua canal Is about $58,000,000
more than that of completing the Pan
ama canal, leaving out the cost of ac
quiring the latter property. This meas
ures the difference in the magnitude
of the obstacles to be overcome in the
actual construction o( the two canals,
and covers all physical considerations
such as the greater or less height of the
dams, the greater or less depth of cuts,
the presence or absence of natural har
bors, the presence or absenoe of a rail
road, the exemption from or liability
to disease, and the amount of work re
maining to be done.
The new Panama Canal company has
shown no disposition to sell its property
to the United States. Should that com
pany be able or willing to sell, there is
reason to believe that the price would
not be such as would make the total
cost to the United States less than that
of the Nicaragua canal.
(2). The Panama canal after comple
tion would be shorter, have fewer locks,
and less curvature than the Nicaragua
canal. The measure of these advan
tages is the time required for a vessel
to pass through, which is estimated for
an average ship at twelve hours for
Panama and thirty-three hours for
Nicaragua. On the other hand, the dis
tance from San Francisco to New York
is 377 miles, to Now Orleans 579 miles,
and to Liverpool 3SR miles greater via
Panama than via Nicaragua. The time
equired to pass over these distances
being greater than the difference in the
time of transit through the canals, the
Nicaragua line, after completion, would
be somewhat the more advantageous of
the two to the United States, notwith
standing the greater cost of maintain
ing the longer canal.
The government of Colombia, in which
lies the Panama canal, has granted an
exclusive concession, which has many
years to run. It is not free to grant the
necessary rights to the United States,
except upon condition that an agree
ment be reached with the new Panama
Canal company. The commission be
lieves that euch an agreement is im
practicable. So far as can be ascer
tained, the company is not willing to
sell its franchise, but it will allow the
United States to become owner of part
of its stock. The commission considers
such an arrangement inadvisable. The
governments of Nicaragua and Costa
Rica, on the other hand, are untram
melled by concessions and are free to
grant to the United States such privi
leges as may be mutually agreed upon.
In view of all the facts, and particu
larly In view of all the difficulties of
cfDta.n'Ti t. rt riTernry i.rit
leges and franchises on the Panama
route,, and assuming the Nicaragua and
Costa Rica recognize the value of the
canal to themselves, and are prepared
to grant concessions on terms which are
reasonable and acceptable to the United
States, the commission Is of the opinion
that "the most practicable and feasible
route for" an Isthmian canal to be
"under the control, management and
ownership of the United States" is
that known as the Nicaragua route.

C. E. THOMPSON'S TRIUMPH
HE GETS THE WEST JIATEN WATt-
vexship r, r Jt ia majority.
Ills Old Political Rival, James II. Peek,
Defeated liy a Majority of 172 Entlof a
Lung Conflict Iletneen the Two
Straight Republican Ticket Elected.
The West Haven borough elections
were held yesterday and resulted in a
sweeping victory for the republicans,
not a candidate on the ticket being de
feated. The great triumph of the day
was the victory of Clarence E. Thomp
son over his old political rival, James
H. Peck for the wardenship, the former
getting there by the big' majority of
172. Even Mr. Thompson's moet san
guine supporters had not looked for
such a large majority in the election,
for they realized that to defeat "Jim"
Peck was no little job. Still they work
ed hard for Mr. Thompson during the
last week, and as Mr. Peck was unable
to do any engineering in his interests
on account of his recent illness there
was a chance for some "tall" pulling
by the new warden's supporters. The
result of this consistent work asserted
itrelf about 8 o'clock, the time for the
closing of the polls, as there was a gen
eral air of satisfaction on the faces of
the republicans in the hall, Everybody
thought that the result of the election
would be close and many expected that
the warden of the last three yearg
would be re-elected.
The victory of Mr. Thompson over Mr.
Peck marks the end of a long political
war between the two gentlemen, as
they have been opposed to each other
In political conflicts in tho borough for
a number of years. The contest at times
has been exceedingly warm and many
strong words have often been fired back
and forth. The meeting of the two
gentlemen for such a position as the
wardenship had, therefore, been the
leading question in the borough ever
since the thing was proposed, and when
Mr. Thompson finally decided to run
on the republican ticket in opposition
to Mr. Peck great was the interest in
the outcome of the election that would
decide which had the upper hand.
As the result of the election was read
by Moderator Dennis Klmberley about
a-.-lb there was a great outburst of ap
plause when it was seen that Mr.
Thompson had won. Somebody propos
ed three cheers for the' new warden,
and they were heartily given. Mr.
Thompson's friends gathered around
him and showered him with congratu
lations on his election.
The rest of the republican ticket was
elected by a large majority. The ticket
and the number nf votes cast for each
of the names on It was as follows:
Warden, Clarence E. Thompson, 591;
burgesses, Shubael F. Butterfleld 654,
John Brown 657, William W. Lines 656;
