scattered a large force of rebels as chaff is scat-
tared by the wind. Parson Brownlow is sup
posed to be with this force, and the rebels ac
knowledge it as a signal victory in our favor.
last Tennessee appears to be unanimous for the
Union, aud if proper assistance is afforded, tbe
last rebel will be driven Irom that section of the
Bute. All honor to the brave uncompromising
editor, who has battled the confederate forces
from the commencement of this rebellion, though
oeatb has threatened him everywhere. It is by
each material that governments are sustained,
and outlaws and traitors crushed out. The skies
brighten in that part of the Union.
Ui. Feici's Pxoclaxatios. The loyal citi
zens of Missouri are called upon, by this rebel
General, for fiity thousand troops to sustain the
Confederate Government, lie acknowledges
that bat five thousand of the citizens of lliraoo-
rl are noder his command, and tbe other forty,
five thousand must bo forthcoming, or their
course is lost. He tells new recruits to bring
their own rations, for he has none for them ; and
there are no arms, for he tells them to bring
anna. He claims no right in Missouri but six
feet of soil, which, we trnst, will not be denied
kim. Five thousand rebel troops in a popula
tion of 1,178,317, are all that respond to tbe
cry of disunion. Who can doubt the result in
Missouri.

Rot. Henry Ward Beecher preached a very elo
quent and effective sermon, on Thanksgiving
day on the rebellion. He took ground very de
cidedly against tbe emancipation of slaves by
act of Congress, and insisted that, unless we
wished to disgrace free government in the eyes
of Um world, we must carry on this war within
tho Emits of the constitution. He insisted, more
over that a provisional government of some kind
mst be established for those slaves who come
into our camps for refuge.
Tm Gbaxo A&mt. The effective force at the
disposition of the government now rises to the
enormous aggregate of 860,000 men (including
regulars,) ot whom, in round numbers, 550,
000 are infantry, and 20,000 artillerymen, be
sides) sharpshooters, engineers, Ac The five
eJavo States of Kentucky Missouri, Msryland,
Delaware, and Western Virgicia, furnish close
wa to 60,000 men in the army of the Union.
Tm Hots i Cohteacts. An exchange says:
Tho government examination into one of tbe
horse contracts in Missouri produced the fact
that out of a lot of four hundred and eleven
aNorses, for which $120 a bead was paid, seventy
Jx were sound, fire were dead, and three hun
dred and thirty were either aged, stifled, ring,

TBva Report wfUte Xterctajry tbe Hawy.
This report b a full and elaborate statement
of the condition of the Naval Department. He
says, tbe condition of the country at the close
of the extra session of Congress demanded of
biaa: - "
1. The dosing of all tbe insurgent ports along
a coast line ot nearly three uvusana miles, iu

lie says, the first condition was complied with
so far as the peculiar nature of marilioe frontier,
which has throughout iu extent a large portiou
of double coast, would admit. Tbe great draft
of the pi in ci pal naval Teasels nude this service,
on our shallow coast, a work of great difficulty
And this was especially true ti the coast ot
North Carolina.
At an early period it became necessary to
place a flotilla on the Lower Potomac. In spite
of many obstacles, for several months the river
has been kept open for commercial purposes,
and the communication between the opposite
shores has, to a great extent, been restricted
For the purpose of bfockadiug the poru more
effectually, fleeU hare been dupatcbed laden
with stone, to be suuk upon the bars of various
harbors. Some have been placed in Ocracoke
Inlet, and another aud larger description of ves
sels were bought iu the Eastern market, mol of
them such as were formerly employed in the
whale fisheries. These weie scut to obstruct
tbe channels of Charleston haibor aud the Sa
vannah river ; and this, if effectually doue, will
prove the most economical and satisfactory
method of interdicting toinnerce at those poiiita.
Siuce the institution of the blockade one hun

has visitod the coast during the present eea&ou.

tbe wreck ot several ot the traiisporu, and com
pelling even some ot the smaller vessels of tbe
uavy to put back, the fleet, by tbe merciful in
terposition ot f rovideuce, was preserved, and
appeared before Port Koyal, oue ol the beoi
inougb neglected barborsou our Southern coast,
ou the 6tu day of November. So soon as the
.i 1 1 nrelim
inary measures accompiiaueu, assaults were maue
on tbe well-built and thoroughly armed foru
Beaurezard and alker. Cousummate naval
strategic skill and the most admirable gunneiy
were exhibited in the stuck, which was of such
tremendous effect that General Drayton and tbe
rebel army surrendered their strongholds, and
fled tbe coast with precipitation, leaving their
property, armament audpapeis, while our naval
forces took aud still bold quiet possession of one
of the finest harbors ou tue Atlantic seaboard.
A demonstration since ordered by Flag Officer
Duponton lybee island, at tno mouth of the
Savannah river, resulted in tbe capture
of that island and the strong Martello tower and
battery that virtually command Fort Pulaski.
Our naval forces have possession of that island,
a part of the south American squadron is at an
chor in tbe hai bor, and the flag of the Union is
still unfurled in Georgia.
A naval force, auxiliary to and connected with
the army movements ou the Mississippi and its
tributaries, has been organized, and is under the
command of Flag Officer Andrew H. Foote, who
is rendering efficient service in that quarter.
Captain Chailes Wilkes, in command of the
Ssn Jacinto, while searching in the Wet Indies
for the Sumter, received information that James
M. Mason nd John Slidell, disloyal citizens and
leading conspirators, were to embark from Ha
vanna in tbe English steamer Trent, on their
way to Europe to promote the cause of the in
surgents. Cruwing in the Bahama Channel be
intercepted the Trent on the 8th of November,
and took from her these dangerous men, whom
ne orougnt to tne 1 in ted states. His vessel
having been ordered to refit for service at
Cbarlestown, the prisoners were retained on
board and conveyed to Fort Warren, where they
were committed to the cunodv of CoL Dim-
ick, in command of that fortress.
The prompt and decisive action of Cantain
Wilkes on this occasion merited and received
the emphatic approval of the department, and
if a too generous forbearance was exhibited by
him in not capturing the vessel which had these
rebel emissaries on board, it mav. in viiw of th
special circumstances, and of iu patriotic mo
tives, oe excused ; out it must by no means
be permitted to constitute a nreedint hereafter
for tbe treatment of any case of similar infrac
tion of neutral obligation bv foreign vessels en

lie recommends that line officers be retired
fr fitrtv-five years service, except when called
into active service by the President. Be thiuks
a grade of flag officers should be designated,
not exceeding seven, by selection qf tbe Presi
dent, who shall each have command, irrespec
tive of seniority or rank, of the squadron to
which he may be assigned, and tbe appointment.
shall cease when tbe officer hauls down his flag,
unless for distinguished and meritorious conduct
in battle, as flag officer, he receives, upon re
commendation of the President, the thanks ot
Congress.
There have been appointed 433 acting masters,
and 209 master's mates. Sixty-one paymasters
are uow on duty, tbe old number being thirty
one.
lie says fugitives from rebel points, have
sought ref uge aud protection on our ships. He
recommends their employment, and that they
should receive wages.
If such employment could not be furnished
to ail by tbe uavy, they might be referred to the
army, aud if uo employment could be found tor
them iu tbe public service, tney snould be al
lowed to proceed freely aud peceably without
restraint to seek a livelihood in any loyal portion
of the country. This I have considered to be
the whole required duty, in tbe premises, of our
naval officers.
He advocates the establishment of a naval de
pot on the lakes.
Oue slavei has been captured.
He estimates the expenses for the current year

For the marine corps, $1,105,656 77.

In conclusion, be says: " To the patriotic of

It
may not be uninteresting to some of your
readers to see a statement of the amount of
provisions consumed by 1,200 men, and the
forage consumed by 1,200 horses per week.
The following is a sutement of the amount
ot each, required for this regiment: 63 bar
rels pork, 225 bbls. flour ; 45 bushels ' beans ;
22 do salt; 5,400 lbs. sugar; 1,440 lbs. soap ;
360 gal. vinegar ; 32,500 lbs. fresh beef; 3,600
do coffee; 1,800 do rice; 640 do tea; 360 do

Florida Waxts All Her Soldixks. The
Governor of Florida hat refused to allow any
more soldiers to be enlisted for tbe " Confeder
acy," and that all persons enlisting row to go
out of the State shall be arrested. Tbe Gov
ernor is evidently getting alarmed for the safety
of his own " sovereignty." The taking of Pen-
eaco!a and our landing at Fernandina would cut
the State off entirely from iu sister Confeder
ates. Florida was one of tbe first States to ruin
into rebellion. It will be one of the first to be
brought back into the Union.
Be Caeifcl is Dieictieo Lxtteez. The
National Intelligencer says : At onr city post-
office hundreds of letters are received weekly for
the soldiers, the superscriptions on which are so
unintelligible as to produce great delay, if even
tbe persons to whom they are directed receive
them at ail. Too much care cannot be observed
in wiiting plainly.
Dxatii ot Gn. Deattov. A letter from
Port Royal announces the death of Gen. Drayton,
who had command of the rebel forces at Port
Royal. It is said that he was wounded in the
Fort and died on tbe retreat. He was a man of
great wealth and large military experience. His
brother. Captain Drayton, had command of one
of tbe Federal ships during the bombardment.
Gbais at Chicago. Tbe grain trade at Chi
cago for eleven months past as per the tablet of
tbe Chicago Tribune, foots np the enormous to
tal of 54,094,219 bushels. There is an increase
over the commerce of 1860 of fifty percent, and
over that of 1859 of about one hundred and
seventy five per cent.
Retaliation. The House ot Representatives
has voted unanimously that Messrs. Mason and
Slidell, now in confinement at Fort Warren,
Brooklyn, shall receive tbe same treatment CoFs
Corcoran and Wood are now receiving at the

Department of State. )
Washington, Dec. 5. i
Maj.-Gen. Geo. B. McClellan, Washington :
General I am directed by the President to
call your attention to the following subject :
Persons claimed to be held to service or labor
nnder the laws of the State of Virginia and ac
tually employed in hostile service against tbe
Government of the United States, frequently es
cape from the lines of the enemy's force, and
are received within the lines of the army of the
Potomac. This department understands that
such persons afterwards coming into the city cf
Washington, are liable to be arrested by the
city police upon tbe presumption arising from
color, that they are fugitives from service or la
bor. By the fourth section of the act of Con
gress, approved Aug. 6, 1661, entitlefl, an act
to confiscate property used for insurrectionary
purposes, such employment is made a ful! and
sufficient answer to any frrther claims to service
or labor. Persons thus employed, and escaping
are received into military protection of the Uni
ted 8tates, and their arrests as fugitives from
service or labor, should be immediately followed
by military arrest of parties making the seizure,
Copies of this communication will be sent to
the Mayor ot the city of Washington, and to the
Marshal of the District of Columbia,that any col
lision between the military and civil authorities
may be avoided.
I am General, your very ob't servant,

nard of Tenn be sw orn in as the member from
the Second District of Tennessee. - - .
Mr. Stevens, of Pa sa:d that Mr. Maynard
mar have been nroDerlv elected, but we all
kuow the fact that Tennessee was as far as it
could I out of the Union. As there weresev
eral other cases, be thought that tbe sut ject
brought forward by Mr. Dawes should be reier
red to tbe Committee on Elections.
Mr. Dav.es thought this was an exception to
tbe rule, as Mr. Maynard was regularly elected
bv a large majority at tbe August election, and
before 1 ennecee bad taken any steps to get
out of tbe Union. He also possesses the proper
certificate, which qualified bim as a member.
Mr. Stevens, of Pa., asked the direct question
whether Mr. Maynard was elected before tbe
State attempt! to secede, and at the time fixed
by law.
Mr. Dawes replied that he was so informed,
and that his election took place under the law
which bad existed for a long- time.
Mr. Stevens then withdrew bis motion, ana
Mr. Maynard was accordingly sworn in as a
member of Con cress Irom i enneseee.

of order.
The claim of Mr. Foster was referred at tbe
extra session to the Committee on Elections,
without favorable action.
Mr. Hickman replied that this was a new
question, different from that of the former elec
tion.
The Speaker overruled the point of order
taken by Mr. v allandigbam.
Mr. Stevens, of Pa., said no harm would be
done by referring the certificate, and on bis mo
tion the case was referred to tbe Committee on
Elections.
Mr. Watts, delegate from New Mexico, was
sworn in,
Mr. Blair, of Va the successor of Mr. Carlisle
was also qualified
Mr. Richardson, of lit, moved that Mr. Segar
of Va.. be also sworn in,
Mr. Danes desired that this case should be
referrel
Mr. Richardson earnestly argued that Segai
should be sworn in. The House snould not de
ny to tbe people of Accomac and Northampton
counties a proper representation, especially as
they had laid down their arms which they had
taken up agaiiist the Federal Government. All
the forms of law had been complied with under
tbe proclamation of the Provisional Govern
ment of Virginia.
Mr. Kellogg, of 111-, argued that Mr. Segar
should be admitted in accordance with princi
ples already settled at tbe extra session
Mr. Dawes desired to do no disrespect by
wishing the question referred ; he wanted the
House to consider the sutject in all Its bear-
inns. It should be ascertained whether uiu
ceutleman was elected by 10,20, or 1,000 roles,
in a district where 10.000 may be cast He
wanted a rule that they could stand by in t
future.
The subject was refered to the Committee on

Mr. Elliott, of Massachusetts, offered the fol
lowing: Itetoived, By the House of Representatives of
tne united states or America: 1st That in
lehalf of these States, we do solemnly declare
that tbe war in which we are no engaged against
the insurgent bodies now in arms against tbe
Government, has for its object tbe suppression
of such rebellion, and the re cstablumirtent of
the rightful authority l the National Constitu
lion and laws, over tbe entire extent of our
common country. 2d. That while we disclaim
all power under tbe Constitution to interfere,
by ordering legislation, with the Constitution
of the several States, yet the war now existing
tnubt be conducted according to tbe usages and
rights of military service ; and, that during its
continuance, the recognized authority of the
maxim that the safety of the State is the high
est right of law, subordinates tbe right of
properiy, ana dominates over civil relations.
3d, That, therefore, we do hereby declare.that
in our judgement, the President of the United
btates, as the Commander-in-Chief of our army.
auu iue oiucers in command under mm,
have the perfect right to emancipate all per
sons held a slaves in any militnry district in a
state of insurrection against tbe national Gov

order of emancipation be issued whenever the
same will avail to weaken tbe power of the reb
els in arms, or to strengthen the military pow
er of the loyal force.

Mr. Stevens, of Pa., submitted the folio win?
for future consideration :
Whereas, Slavery has been the canse of the
present rebellion in the United States; and
whereat, there can be no solid and permanent
peace and union in this republic so lone as that
institution exists within it; and whereat, slaves
are now used by the rebels as an essential
