uestion of corporations and railroad
legislation. Hie president says:
Corporatloam.
I am in no sense hostile to corpora
tions. This is an age of combination,
and any effort to prevent all combina
tion will be not only useless, but In the
end vicious, because of the contempt
for law which the failure to enforce
law inevitably produces. The corpora
tion has come to stay, just as the
trades union has come to stay. Bach
can do and has done great good. Each
should be favored so long as it does
good. But each should be sharply
checked where It acts against law and
justice.
Experience has shown conclusively
that it is useless to try to get any ade
quate regulation and supervision of
these great corporations by state ac
tion. Such regulation and supervision
can only be effectively exercised by a
sovereign whose jurisdiction Is coex
tensive with the field work of the cor
porations—that is, by the national gov
ernment I believe that this regulation
and supervision can be obtained by the
enactment of law by the congress. If
this proves impossible, it will certainly
be necessary ultimately to confer In
fullest form such power upon the na
tional government by affirmative ac
ment of the constitution.
The laws of the congress and of the
several states hitherto, as passed upon
by the courts, have resulted more often
In showing that the states have no
power in the matter than that the na
tional government has power so that
there at present exists a very unfortu
nate condition of things, under which
these great corporations doing an in
terstate business occupy the position of
subjects without a sovereign, neither
any state government nor the national
government having effective control
over them. Our steady aim should be
by legislation, cautiously and carefully
undertaken, but resolutely persevered
In, to assert the sovereignty of the na
tional government by affirmative ac
tion.

This is only in form an Innovation.
In substance it is merely a restoration,
for from the earliest time such regula
tion of industrial activities has been
recognized in the action of the law
making bodies, and all that I propose
Is to meet the changed conditions in
such manner as will prevent the com
monwealth abdicating the power it has
always possessed, not only in this coun
try, but also in England before and
since this country became a separate
nation.
Railroad Rate Legislation.
As 1 said in my message of Dec. 6
last the immediate and most pressing
need so far as legislation is concerned
is the enactment into law of some
scheme to secure to the agents of the
government such supervision and regu
lation of the rates charged by the rail
roads of the country engaged in inter
state traffic as shall summarily and ef
fectively prevent the imposition of un
just or unreasonable rates. It must
include putting a complete stop to re-.
bates in every shape and form. This
power to regulate rates, like all similar
powers over the business world, should
be exercised with moderation, caution
and self restraint but it should exist
so that it can be effectively exercised
when the need arises.
In my judgment the most important
provision which such law should con
tain is that conferring upon some cpm
petent administrative body, fhe power
to decide upon the case being brought
before it whether a given rate pre
scribed by a railroad is reasonable and
just, and if it is found to be unreason
able and unjust then, after full investi
gation of the complaint, to prescribe
the limit of rate beyond^ which it shall
not be lawful to go—the maximum
reasonable rate, as it is commonly call
ed—this decision* to go into effect with
in a reasonable time and to obtain
from thence onward, subject to review
by the courts.
It sometimes happens at present, not
that a rate is too high, but that a fa
vored shipper is given too low a rate.
In such case the commission would
have the right to fix this already estab
lished minimum rate as the maximum,
and it would need only one or two such
decisions by the commission to cure
railroad companies of the practice of
giving improper minimum rates. I call
your attention to the fact that my pro
posal is not to give the commission
power to initiate or originate rates gen
erally, but to regulate a rate already
fixed or originated by the- roads- upon
complaint and after investigation. A
heavy penalty should be exacted from
any corporation which fails to respect
an order of the commission. I regard
this power to establish a maximum
fate as being essential to any scheme
of real reform in the matter of railway
regulation.
It is worth while considering whether
it would not be wise to confer on the
government the right of civil action
against the beneficiary of a rebate for
at least twice the value of the rebate.
This would help stop what Is really
blackmail. Elevator allowances should
6e stopped, for they have now grown
to such an extent^that they are demor
alizing and are used as rebates.

PRESIDENrSMESSAGE
President Roosevelt's annual message
has be^n delivered to congress. Open
ing with a plea for the co-operation of
all classes in continuing the country's
prosperity and in correcting existing
evils, for a "square deal" for every-1
body, the message first takes up the

this way can violations or evasions of
the law be surely detected. A system

should be provided similar to that now

the bank examiners. A few first class
railroad accountants, if they bad prop
er direction and proper authority to in
spect books and papers, could aeconi-
Elish
much in preventing willful vlola
ons of the law.
EaploTrrt' Liability Law.
In my annual message to the Fifty
eighth congress at its second session I
recommended the passage of an em
ployers' liability law for the District of
Columbia and In our navy yards. I re
newed that recommendation In my
message to the Fifty-eighth congress at
Its second session and further suggest
ed the appointment of a commission to
make a comprehensive study of em
ployers' liability with a view to the en
actment of a wise and constitutional
law covering the subject, applicable to
all industries within the scope of the
federal power. I hope that such a law
will be prepared and enacted as speed
ily as possible.
There has been demand for depriving
courts of tlie power to issue injunctions
in labor disputes. Such special limita
tion of the equity powers of our courts
would be most unwise. It is true that
Bome judges have misused this power,
but this does not justify a denial of the
power any. more than an improper ex
emse of the power to call a strike by a
labor leader would justify the denial of
the right to strike. The remedy is to
regulate the procedure by requiring the
judge to give due notice to the adverse
parties before granting the writ, the
hearing to be ex parte if the adverse
party does not appear at the time and
place ordered. What is due notice must
depend upon the facts of the case. It
should not be used as" a pretext to per
mit violation of law or the jeopardiz
ing of life or property. Of course this
would not authorize the issuing of a
restraining order or injunction in any
case in which it is not already author
ized by existing law.
I renew the recommendation I made
In my last annual message for an in
vestigation by the department of com
merce and labor of general labor condi
tions, especial attention to.be paid to
the conditions, of child labor and child
labor legislation in the several states.
Such an investigation should take into
account the various problems with
which the question of child labor is
connected. In such a republic as ours
the one thing that we cannot afford to
neglect is the problem of turning out
decent citizens. The future of the na
tion depends upon the citizenship of
the generations to come. The children
of today are those who' tomorrow will
shape the destiny of our land, and we
cannot afford to neglect them. The leg
islature of Colorado has recommended
that the national government provide
some general measure for the protec
tion from abuse of children and dumb
animals throughout the United States.
I lay the matter before you for what I
trust will be your favorable consider
ation.
A« to Women Who Worlc.
The department of commerce and la
bor should also make a thorough inves
tigation of the conditions of women in
industry. Over 5.000,000 American wo
men are now engaged in gainful occu
pations, yet there is an almost complete
dearth of data upon which to base any
trustworthy conclusions as regards a
subject as important as it is vast and
complicated. -The introduction of wo
men into industry is working change
and disturbance in tb£ domestic and
social life of the nation. The decrease
in marriage, and especially In the birth
rate, has been coincident with it We
must face accomplished facts, and the
adjustment to factory conditions must
be made, but surely it can be made
with less friction and fess harmful ef
fects on family life than is now the
case. This whole matter in reality
forms one of the greatest sociological
phenomena of our time. It is a social
question of the first importance, of far
greater importance than any merely po
litical or economic question can be.
In any great' labor disturbance not
only are employer and employee inter
ested, hut also a third party—the gen
eral public. Every, considerable labor
difficulty In which interstate comnierce
Is involved should be investigated by
the government and the facts officially
reported to the public.
Iniiurance."
The great insurance companies afford
striking examples of corporations
whose business has extended so far
beyond the jurisdiction of the states
which created them as to preclude
strict enforcement of supervision and
regulation by the parent states. In my
last annual message I recommended
"that the congress carefully consider
whether the power of the bureau of
corporations cannot constitutionally be
extended to cover interstate transac
tions in Insurance." Recent events
have emphasized the Importance of an
early and exhaustive consideration of
this question, to see whether it is not
possible to furnish better safeguards
than the several states have been able
to furnish against corruption of the
flagrant kind which has been exposed.
It has been only too clearly shown
that certain of the men at the head of
these large corporations take but small
note of the ethical distinction between
honesty and dishonesty. They draw
the line only this side of what may be
called law honesty, the kind of honesty
necessary In order to avoid failinir Into
the clutches of the law. Of course the
only complete remedy for this condl*

the growth of a spirit which condemns
all dishouesty, whether in rich man or
In poor man, whether it takes the shape
of bribery or of blackmail. But much
can be done by legislation which is not
only drastic, brit practical. There is
need of a far stricter and more uni
form regulation of the vast insurance
Interests of this country. .The United
States should in this respect follow the
policy of other nations by providing
adequate national supervision of com
mercial interests which are clearly na
tional in character.
I repeat my previous recommenda
tion that the congress should consider
whether the federal government has
tny power or owes any duty with re
spect to domestic transactions in in
surance of an interstate character.
That state supervision has proved in
adequate is generally conceded.
TH« RCTCBBM.
There Is more need of stability than
of the* attempt to attain an ideal per
fection In the methods of raising rev
enue, and the shock and strain to the
business world certain to attend any
serious change In these methods ren
der such change Inadvisable unless for
grave reason. It is not possible to lay
down any general rule by which to de
termine the moment when the reasons
for will outweigh the reasons against
such a change. No change can be
made on lines beneficial to or desired
by ode section or one state only. There
must be something like a general agree
ment among the citizens of the several
Btates that the change is needed and
desired in the interest of the people as a
whole, and there should then be a sin
cere, Intelligent and disinterested ef
fort to make it in such shape as will
combine, so far as possible, the maxi
mum of good to the people at large
with the minimum of necessary disre
gard for the special Interests of locali
ties or classes, but in time of peace
the revenue jnust on the average,
taking a series of years together, equal
the expenditures or else the revenues
must be increased. Last year there
was a deficit Unless our expenditures
can be kept within the revenues then
our revenue laws must be readjusted..
It Is impossible to outline what shape
such a readjustment should take, for
It is as yet too early to say whether
there will be need for It It should be
considered whether It Is not desirable
that the tariff laws should provide for
applying as against or In favor of any
other nation maximum and minimum
tariff rates established by the congress,
so as to secure a certain reciprocity of
treatment between other nations and
ourselves.
Economy In Expenditures.
I earnestly recommend to the con
feress the need of economy and, to this
end, of a rigid scrutiny of appropria
tions. All unnecessary offices should
be abolished. In the public printing
also a large saving of money can be
made. There is a constantly growing
tendency to publish masses of unim
portant information at which no human
being ever tooks.
Yet. in speaking of economy, I must
in nowise be urderstood as advocating
the false economy which is in the end
the worst extravagance. To cut down
in the navy would be a crime against
the nation. To fail to push forward all
work on the Panama canal would be
as great a folly.
At Various times I have instituted in
vestigations into the organization and
conduct of the business
*T* lfc»
Cnrrency. V-
Every consideration of prudence de
mands the addition of the element of
elasticity to our currency system. The
evil does not consist In an inadequate
volume of money, but in the rigidity
of this volume, which does not respond
as it should. to the varying needs of
connmmi'tics and of seasons. Inflation
must be avoided, but some provision
should made that will insure a
larger volume of money during the fall
and winter months, than In the less ac
tive seasons pf the year, so that .the
currency will contract against specula
tion and will expand for the needs of
legitimate business. At present the
treasury department is at Irregularly
recurring intervals obliged in the inter
est of the business world—that Is, in
the interests of the American public—
'to try to avert financial crises, by pro
viding a remedy which should be pro
vided by congressional action.

Inquiries have yet progressed far
enough to warrant final conclusions,
they have already confirmed and em

methods are antiquated, and inefficient

In my last annual message I said:
"The power of the government to
protect the integrity of the elections of
Its own officials is inherent and has
been recognized and Affirmed by re
