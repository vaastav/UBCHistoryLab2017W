A Little Late, But Quite Satisfactory.
On our first page this week we
print an article from the Pollock
Press, of Nov. 30. under the cap
tion, "Our Side of the Question."
It is an apology and correction of
an untruthful statement relative
to the Colfax Chronicle made b.
the Press in its issue of Nov. 9.
The apology comes a little late,
but it is quite satisfactory to us,
save as to one or two intimations
that were entirely unnecessary
and were not borne out by the
facts. The Chronicle force did
not "correct the figures on the
press," as Editor White pretends
to imagine may have been done,
and neither he nor any one else
ever saw any such incorrect fig
ures in this paper. The figures
were set up absolutey correct in,
the Chronicle office, no such er
ror having appeared in the proof
sheet or in any single copy of
nearly a thousand issues of the
Chronicle printed and distributed
in Grant parish. However, since
the editor of the Press in his
statement, "OurSide of the Ques
tion," pleads guilty to "honest
misrepresentation," we will let c
it go at that, and shall consider
the incident closea.
Meore Than Forty Years on the Tripod.
Brother H. G. Goodwyn, editor of the
Colfax Chronicle, has entered upon his s
forty-first year of service. Forty years o
is a long period of time, more than aM
generation: and but few men in this p
State can equal this record of continu- u
eas service. May you be able to do a
your bit many years more, brother.- 0
Abbeville Meridional.
Brother Edwards, of the Me- a
Ildional, voices the kindly ex- a,
trimr. the State reshave
littered upon the completion of a
dutPfortieth year as the continu
ous editor of the Colfax Chroni- a
cle. We intended to print all of o
them, but failed to do so owing a
to a combination of circumstan- w
eON. Among them we were try- ot
ing to get straigtened out in our "
new office about that time, and w
also having a tussle to get well "a
from an attack of la grippe, and be
between the struggle it was quite h
difficult to keep things going and us
remember to be real courteous w+
and observe the usual amenities up
at the same time. However, we
pulled through, thanks to a kind th
Providence, and are again bale
and hearty and hope to b! with
the boys of the press and doing be
our bit for some time to come.

Pleaty of Corn to Briag Down Food an
Piees.
New York, Dec. 6.-Lower prices in
meat. milk and other commodities as a de
result of the enormous crop of corn evi
which is expected will be distributed sin
through the country by January 15, was n
forecast by Federal Food Administrator "
Hoover in a statement Tuesday night. .r
He declared that this extraordinary crop prc
is "the certain economic remedy for t
high prices." y
In addition to the above tele- l
gram a dispatch from Washing- !
ton of same date says that "bread
prices are to tumble on Dec. 10." arm
The reason for this is that the
War Emergency Council has re-e.
ommended an immediate redue- 11*
tion wherever possible in bread the
prices throughout the country. bin
In order to enforce this the bak
ing industry is to be put under hon
.the license system, and there pe
should be an immediate reduc
tion to the retailer and consumer. of
The exhorbitant prices that r
have prevailed in Louisiana are a
the direct result of greed and peoj
speculation, and the advantage 'w
that has been taken of short
crops of corn and hay in this ada
State, while the country at large h
has made good crops. The mat- a
ter should be looked into by the pay
.. War Council. nag

s- Ing the objects we shall hoea aways
in view.
I shall not go back to debate the
causes of the war. The intolerable
er wrongs done and planane as anst us
by the siniuster masters ox t.erfsany
have long since become too groasty
obvious and odious to eve.y true
American to need to be rehearsed. U
he But I shall ask you to consider again
San with a very grave scrutiny utur
os objectives and the measures by which n
a we mean to attain them; tor the par- '
mis pose or discussion here in this place '
u- is action and our action must move a
do straight toward definite ends. Our P
ot.ject is, of course, to win the war,°
and we shall not slacken or uttear v
ourselves to be diverted until It is
e won. But It is worth white askingL
K- and answering the questlon vhen shall 
ot
From one point at view it is not a
)f necessary to brdach this tuandamemtal
matter. I do not doubt that the Amer-.
ican people know what the war is V
- about ani what sort of an outeome el
tf tney will regard as a realisation of a
g their purpose in It. As a nation we
are united tm spirit and Intention. I
pay little heed to those who tell me
otherwise. I hear the voices of die- rc
r sent-who does not? I hear thq eriti
d sm and the clamor of the noisly d
toughtless and troubleome. I also
see men here and there fling them
d selves in impotUnt disloyalty againt to
the calm, indomitable power of the in
nation. I hear men debate peace who
understand neither its nature nor the '
s way in waich we main attain it with c
uplifted eyes and unbroken spirits. In
but I know that afte of these speaks we
Stor the nation. They do not touch as
jthe heart of anything. They may
sa ely be lett to strut their uneasy s
hour and be forgotten. he
SBut trom another point of view I '
Sbelieve that it is necessary to say lo
plainly whAt we here at the seat of
action consider the war to be for and a'
what part we mean to play it the set. cot
tiement of its searchinl issues. We e
I are the spokesmen of the American ma
people and they have a right to know mU
Swhether their purpose Is ours. They hal
Sdesire peace by the overcoming of on
Ievil, by the deteat once for all of the uE
I sinister forces that Interrupt pe;.e it
Sand render it lmpossible, and they AU
wish to know how closely our thought
runs with theirs and what action we 51
propose. They are Impatient with
those who desire peace by any sort
of compromise-deeply and indignant
ly impatlent-but they will be equally
impatient with us it we do not make it
plain to them what our ohjectives are to
and what we are planning for in seek- wa)
Ing to make conquest of peace by Aur
arms. ail
I believe that I speak for them owa
when I say two thinga: First, that ical

the ugly face, this menace of eom- are

of nations, and, second, that when this tron
Thing and its power are indeed de- or
feated and the time comes that we A
can discuss peace-when the German rega
people have spokesmen whose word like

spokesmen are ready in the name of fere
their people to accept the common shot

"Intrigue Led Russia Astray."
You catch, with me, the'volces of
humanity that are in the air. They
grow more audible, more articulate,
more persuasive, and they come from
the hearts of men everywhere. They
insist, that the war shall not end in
vindictive action of any kind; that
no nation or people shall be robbed
or punished because the irresponsib'e
IAN rulers of a single country have them.
selves done deep and rbominable
wrong. It is this thought that has
been expressed in the formula, "no
annexations, no contributions, no
punitive indemnities." Just because
this crude formula expresses the in.
stinctive judgment as to right of plain
men everywhere, it has been made
RIA diligent use of by the masters of Ger
man intrigue to lead the people of
Rursia astray-a`d the people of ev
iery other country their agents could
reach, in order that a premature peace
d- might be brought about before sa
key tocracy has been taught its final and
Yet convincing lesson and the people of
ca the world put in control of their own
destinies.
But the fact that a wrong use has
been made of a just idea is no reason
why a right use shbuld not be made
.of it
me It ought to be brought u-lder me
patronage of its real friends. Let It
be said again that autocracy mrst
sl iat be shown the utter futility of
its claims to power or leadership in
it" the modern world. It is impossible
_ to apply any standard of justice so
t > long as such forces are unchecked
!t and undefeated as the present ma,
ters of Germany command. Not on
art tl that has been done can Right de
"d set up as arbAter and peacemaker
among the nations. But when that
__ has been done-as God willing it as
e suredly will be-we shall at last be
free to do an unprecedented thidg

pose to do it We shall be free Iol

In pUshed. Every power and resource J

TWo Wish to impair Austria.
We owe it, however, to ouruelve4
to say that we do not wish in snR
way to impair or to rearrange the
Austria-Hungarian empire. It is no
affair of ours what they do with their
own life, either industrially or polit-,
leally. We do not purpose or desir
to dictatj to them in any way.. We
only desire to see that their afairs
are left in their own hands, in all
matters, great or small. We shall.
hope to secure for the peoples of the
Balkan peninsula, for the people of
the Turkish empire the right and op'
portunity to make their own lve.
safe, their own fortunes secure
agalinst oppression or injustice and
from the dictation of foreign cburta
or parties.
And our attitude and purpose with
regard to Germany herself are of a
like kind. We intend no wrong
against the German empire; no ainter
ference with her internal affairs. We
should deem either the one or the oth
er absolutely unjustifiable, absolutely
contray to the princ:ples we have pro-,
leased to live by and to hold meat'
sacred throughout our life as a a-.

Jefferson Highway Signs for Grant.
Having been written to relative to
the $297 paid by Grant parisa last year
for the markings and signs for the Jef
ferson Highway through this parish,
Hon. J. D. Clarkson, general manager,
replies as follows:
Des Moines, Iowa, Dec. 2, 1917.
Mr. H. G. Goodwyn, Colfax, La.
Dear Mr. Goodwyn-Replying to your
favor of recent date, will say that you
are certainly entitled to the enameled
signs, and instructions were given at
this office long ago to ship them to you,
but upon investigation, after receiving
your letter, I find for some unknown
cause the shipment has not been made.
This will be attended to at once.
You will be sent 24 signs with full
and complete instructions for putting
them up. I trust that these instruc
tions will be thoroughly read and un
derstood and fully complied with, as
we very much desire that the marking
and signing of the Highway shall be
fully standard from end to end.
The Association does not expect to
furnish signs for each cross street in
the towns. These signs are especially
for cross roads and diverging roads in
the country. When these roads have
been supplied, there will be no objec
tion to using the surplus signs in the
towns, at the main intersecting streets.
Was pleased to learn that the actual
construction of the Highway will soon
be under way.
Thanking you for calling our atten
tion to the signs, and with kindest re
gards to all, I remain.
Sincerely yours,
J. D. CLaRxsoN,
