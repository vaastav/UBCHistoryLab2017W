marked as containing fresh fish1
Last night it was attempted to send
the same box to Cincinnati, the
contents this time being cotton seed,
but it was refused by the Express
Company as being of no value.
The change of - contents aroused
"suspicion, which led this morning to
the discovery of the body.
Later. Bennett Jackson, his

PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE.
Following I tyuoptU of Prenl
tieut Hiyee' message, read la both
nousee at the astembllng of tbe Forty
Sixth Cod grew yesterday :
Ha congratulates OongmM on tbe suc
cessful execution of the Resumption tct.
Tbe demand upon the Treasury for gold
and silver in exchange fir United States
notes has been comparatively small, and
the voluntary deposit of coin and bullion
in eiohange for notes has been very large.
Tbe excess of the precious metals depos
ited or exchanged lor United States notes
over the amount of United States notes re
deemed is about forty million dollars. He
refers to the consequent revival of trade,
and says the increasing foreign demand for
our manufacturers' and agricultural pro
ducts has caused a large balance of trade
in our favor, which has been paid in gold,
from tbe first of July list to November
15th, to the amount of $59,000,000. Since
the resumption of specie, payments there
kaaaleo been a marked and gratifying im
provement of the public credit. The
bonds of the Government, bearing only
four per cent, interest, have been sold at or
above pat sufficient in amount to pay off
all of ths National debt; Which was re
deemable under present laws. Tbe
amount of interest saved annually by this
process of refunding the debt since March
1st, 1877, is $147,177 The bonds sold
were largely in .auiall sums, and the
number of our-citizens now holding tbe
public securities h much greater than ever
before. The amount of tbe National debt
which matures within less than two years
is $-,92,121,700, of which $500,000,000 bears
interest at the rate of five per cent., and
the balance is in bonds bearing six per
cent interest It is believed that this part
of the public debt Can be refunded by the
issue of four per cent: bonds, and by tbe
reduction of interest which will thus bo
effected, about eleven million dollars can
be annually saved to the Treasury.
To secure this important reduction of
interest paid by tbe United States, fur
ther legislation il lequired, which, it is
hoped will be provided by Congress dur
ing its present lession. The coinage of
gold by the mints of tba United States dur
ing tbe last fiscal year, was flO.WO.UIZ
The coinage of silver dollars sicce the pas
sage of the act for that purpose to Novem
ber 1st, 1879, was $45,000,850, of which
$12,700,844 have - been issued from tbe
Treasury and are now in circulation and
$itt,300,606 are still in the pesseion of the
Government. Tbe pending of tbe propo
sition for a union of action between the
United Slates and tbe principal commer
cial nations of Surope, to the effect that a
permanent System fur tbe equality of gold
and silver in the recognized money of the
world, leads me to recommend ttial Con
gress refrain from new legislation on the
general subject The great revival of trade,
internal and foreign, will supply, during
tbe coming year, its own instructions,
which may well be awaited before attempt
ing further experimental measures with
the coinage. 1 would, howover, strongly
urge upon Congress the importance of au
thorizing the Secretary of the Treasury to
suspend the coinage of silver dollars upon
the pre-enl lgal rates. Tho market value
of the silver dollar being uniformly and
largely Jlcss than tbe market value of the
gold dollar, it is obviously impracticable to
maintain tbem Ht par with each other, if
both are coined without limit. It' the
oeupnr coin is f rced into circulation it
will, if corned without limit soon bocoraw
the solo standard vlttfc and thus defeat!

Tbe iscue of United States notes during

was not aiCol-ifead.fxcept as a means of

The cUculuticnVtC these notes as paper

law under which they were issued. They
anticipated tbe redemption and withdrawal
Af thieaA nntpa at LhA AarliAfit nracticAble

the object for which they were provided, tbe
.policy of the United states, steadily ad-
IVViivj vi tua u mien, owtas, sirmuy -
loured to from tba adootion of tbe Uonsti
tution, has been to avoid the creation of a
National debt, and wben trom necessity
in the time of war debts have been crea
ted, they have been paid offon the return of
peace as rapidly as possible. , With this
iew and for this purpose, It is recom
mended that tbe existing laws for the ac
cumulation of a sinking fund .sufficient
to extinguish tbe-public debt within a
limited peroid be maintained.
If any change of the objects or rates of
taxation is deemed necessary by Congress,
it is suggested that experience has sbown
that a duty can be placed on tea and coffee
which will not enhance tbe price of these
articles to tbe consumer and which will
add several millions of dollars annually to
tbe Treasury.
On the subject -ct polygamy tbe Presi
dent ssys: .. Utah has a population
sufficient to entitle it to admission as a
State, and the general interests of tbe Na
tion, as well as the welfare of the citizens of
tbe Territory, require its advance from the
territorial form of government to tbe re
sponsibilities and privileges of a State.
This important change, however, will not
be approved by the country, while the
citizens of Utah, in a very considerable
number, uphold a practice which is con,
demed as a orime by the laws of all civil
ized communities throughout the world.
He mentions that the law for the suppres
sion of polygamy has now been decided by
tbe Supreme Court as to be within the leg
islative power of Congress, and binding, as
a ru'e of action for nil who rciide witbin
the Territories. There is no longer
any reason- for delay or hesi
tation : in its- enforcement. It
should be firmly and effectually exe
cuted. If not sufficiently strong in i s pro
visions it should be amended, and in aid
of tbe purpose In view I recommend
; hat more comprehensive and mors search
ing methods for preventing as woll as pun
ishing this crime be provided. If nec
essary to secure obedience to the law, the
enjoyment and exerciso of the rights and
privileges of citizenship in the territories
of the United Suites maybe withheld or
withdrawn from those who violate or op
pose tbe enforcement of the law on this
subject.
Tbe elections of the vast year.
though occupied only with State officers,
have not failed to elicit, in the political
discussions which have attended them all
over tho oountry, new and decisive evi
dence of the deep interest which tbe great
body of citizens lake in the progrecs of the
country toward a more general and com
plete establishment at whatever cist, of
universal security and freedom in the ex
ercise of tne elective franchise. While
many topics of political concern demand
great attention trom our people, both in
tne sphere of National and State authority,
I find no reason to qualify the opinion I
expressed in my last annual message, that
no temporary or administrative iuteresls
of,the Government however urgent or
weighty, will ever display tbe zeal of our
people in defense of the primary rights of
iiiizenauip, ana mat ine powtr ot public
opinion will override all political prejudice
and all sectional and S.ate attachments, in
demanding that, all over our wide territory,
the name and character of a citizen of tbe
United States shall mean one and the same
thing, and carry with them unchallenged
security and respect. I earnestly appeal
to the intelligence and pattiotism of all
good citizens of every (.art of tbe country,
however much they may bo divided in
opinioni on other , political subjects, to
unite in compelling' obedience to existing
laws aimed at the protection of the right
of suffrage. I respectfully urge upon Con
gress to supply any defects in these laws
which experience has ihowa, and which it
is within its power to remedy. I again
invoke ' the co-operation of tbe exec
utive and legislative authorities of
the States in ' this great purpose.
I am fully convinced that if the public
mind cn be set at rest on this paramount
question of popular rightj.no serious ob
jection will thwart or delay the complete
pacification of tbe country or retard the
general diffusion of prosperity.
On the subject of civil service re
form, which the President treats
at some length, be says: "In
view of the faota that during a consid
erable period the government of Great
Britain has been dealing with administra
tive problems and abuses in various par
ticulars analogous to those presented in this
country, and that in reoent years the meas
ures adopted were understood to have been
effective and in averyfrespect highly satis
factory, I thought h desirable to have
fuller information upon tbe subject, and
accordingly requested the chairman of the
Civil Service Commission to make a thor
ough investigation for this purpose. Tbe
ruault has been an elaborate and tompre
heniiva report Tbe report sets forth the
history of tho partisan spoils system in
Great Britain, and of the rise and fall of the
Parliamentary patronage and of official
interference witn the freedom of elections.
It show that alter long trials of various
kinds of examjnations,and open on equal
term 'to all, and which are carriod on
under the superintendence of a ; tingle
commiasion, have with great advantage
been established as copditiont of admission
to almost every ofUoial place in the subor
dinate administration kjf that country of
British India. The completion of tbe re
port, owing to the extent of labor involved
in its preparation, and the omission of Con
gress to make any provision either for the
composition or the expenses of the com
mission, has been postponed until the pres
ent time. It is herewith transmitted to
Congress. While tbe reform measures of
anothor government are of no authority for
us, they are entitlod to influence to the ex
tent to which their intrinsic wisdom and
their adaptation to . our institutions
and : social life may commend
them to our consideration. The
views I have bertstoforo exprested

civil administration remain uncbanned. ex

been salutary in a marked degree, and that
tbe goneral application of similar rules can
not fail to be of decided benefit to lb ser
vice. I deem it my duty to renew the re
commendation contain in my annual
message of December, 1877, requesting
Congress to make the neccessary appro
priations for the resumption of tbe work of
tbe Civil Service Comnission. Economy

and it may never, porhi.(B, be necessary,
to define with precision tJu proper limit of
political action on tbe part of Federal
officers; but, while their light to bold and
freely express their opinions can not be
questioned, it is very pla t that they should
neither be allowed to dorble to other sub
jects the timo needed f-j the proper dis
charge of tbeir official duties, nor to use
the authority of their oHw to enforce their
own opinions, or to coerce the political ac
tions of tboie who hold Jtforent opinions.
Keasuns of justice and publio policy, quito
analogous to those whici forbid the use
of official power for t;e oppression of
the private citizen, iiljose upon the
Government the dut.vf of protecting
its officers and agents fntm arbitrary ox
actions, from whatever aoct considered.
The uractioeof miking lefies for party pur
poses, upon the salaries o officers, is highiJ
ly demoralizing 10 me niuiru service and
discreditable to the country. Though an
officer should be as free is any other cili

SPOFFORD-KELLOGG.
New Orlkanb, Nov. 29. The in.
vestigation of the Kellogg case was
continued to-day before the sub
committee. Peter Williams was recalled, and
testitified that Vincent Dickerson,
of St. James, and J. J. Johnson,
of DeSoto', members of the Legisla
ture, were flush the day after Kel
logg's election. Johnson told him
that he always voted for the man
who paid him the mot.
John Fitzpatrick, a prominent
Democratic politician and Criminal
Sheriff, testified that Francis Garrett
had the reputation of being an un
reliable man. From what he knew
of his character he (witness) would
not believe him on oath.
Christoper Madden, John Coch
rane, formerly Internal Revenue
Collector, and M. Kernberger were
called and corroborated Fitzpatt
rick's testimony.
Thos. Murray testified that the
statements of Dickerson and John
Vigers, to the effect that he (Mur
ray) had exhibited to them a large
amount of money when he returned
from Washington, were false. lie
had received no consideration for
his testimony; he would not believe
Dickerson or Vigers on oath. The
statement that he said he would get
money from the Democrats for his
testimony, was also false. George
Bird and other members of the
Legislature told him they were paid
for voting for Kellogg. Jim Lewis
tried to get the witness to stand by
the party, and the party, they said,
would stand by him. This offer
witness refused, on the ground that
he had told the truth and intended
to stick by it. In Washington, Do
Lacy said Swazery had arranged
with Kellogg for a place
for him ( DeLacy ), and
that he (Delucy) would deny the
signature to tbe affidavit. Barney
Williams offered witness five thou
sand dollars if he wolud go to
Canada and "go back" on his testi
mony. Did not say that Kellogg
had authorized this. Witness
thought it was a trick to entrap
him... Othe l came to , . seo
Murray in Washington in the inter
est of Ivellogc;. Murray stated
that he had been doing next to noth
ing since his return from Washing
ton had made one hundred and
eighty dollars by work and nearly
one hundred dollars by gambling.
E. S. Webber, Senator in the
Packard Legislature, testified that
when Kellogg was elected Lucius
Early, Milton Jones Swaisie, Sena
tor John E. Breauz aud Priestly
Baker all told witness they had
received money for voting for Kel
logg. Weber said he absented
himself from the Packard Son
ate, breaking the quorum. lie
received nine thousand dollars in
State warrants and a due bill for
one thousand dollars to return. It
was understood that Kellogg and
Packard furnished the warrants.
Heard several members say there
was not a quorum present when
Kellogg was elected.

the loss of the oil and the injury
to rolling stock.
