vl 'i . '
Fellow-citizens of the Sfnaie
and House of Representatives :
' Another year of health and of suffic
iently abundant harvest has passed.
"Forthcse, and especially for the im
proved condition of our national aff
airs, our ronewed tid profound grat
itude to God is duo.
We remain in noaco and friendship
with foreign powers. Tlie -cilcrta of
disloyal citizens of tho United States
to involve us in foreign wars, to aid an
inexcusable insurrection, Jurvo teen
unavailing. Her Brittanic Majesty's
Government, as was justly expected,
have exercised their authority to prc
vent the departure f now hostile ex
peditions from British ports. The Ei
pcrbrjof France has, "by alike proceed
ing, promptly indicated the neutrality
.which ho proclaimed at tho beginning
of tho contest.
Questions of great intricacy and im
portance havo arisen out of tho block -udo
and other belligerent operations
between the Government and several
ot the maritime powers, but they have
been discussed, and. so far as was pos-
bible.accoininodated in a spirit of frank-
ness, justice and mutual good will. It
is especially gratifying tliatour Prize
Courts, by tho impartiality of their ad
judications, have commanded tho res-
pectana eonnueneo 01 maritime pow
ders. Tho supplemental treaty between
a tho United States and Great Britain,
t'iJer the suppression of African slave
y teado, madc'on tho 17th day of Febru
r any last, has been duly ratified ai d
r carried into exocution. It is believed
l that, so far as American ports and
. American citizens are concerned, that
. inhuman and barbarous traffic has been
brought to an end.
.' -1 -shall submit, for tho consideration
of thc-Sonnto, a convention for the ud
'justment of possessory claims in Wash
nngtoriTerritory, arising out of the
v. treaty of tho 15th of Juno, 1846, bc
'. rween-tho United States and Great
r tliritain, and which havo been tho
" sflonreo of some disquiet among tho cit
rieertsof that now rapidly improving
;!prtof the country.
Anovol and important question, in--vrtving
tho extent of the maritime ju
lTwdiction ofSnain in tho waters which
surround the Island of Cuba, has been
.debated witnout reaching an ngree
mient, and it is proposed in an amicablo
: spirit to refer it to the arbitrament of
a friendly power. A convention lor
that purpose will bo Bubmittod to the
i Senate.
I have thought it a proper subject
.'for tho approval of tho Sonalc, to con
cur with the interested commercial
powers in an arrangement for the liq
luidation of tho Scheldt dues, upon the
lprinoiples which have been heretofore
auloptod in regard to tho imposts upon
aiavigation in tho waters of Den mark.
The long pending controversy bo
ttweon this Government and that of
Chili, touching the seizuro at Silana.
in Peru, by Chilian officers, of a large
aunount in trcasuro belonging to. citi
zens of tho United States, has been
brought to a closo by the award of his
Majesty the King of tho Belgians, to
whose arbitration the question was re
ferred by the parties. Tho subject
was thoroughly and patiently exam
inedby that justly respected Magis
trate, and although the sum awarded
t. to tho claimants may not have been as
largo as tliej'expectcd,thero isno reason
to distrust tho wisdom of his Majosty's
decision. That decision was prompt
Iv complied with by Chili, when intel
ligcnce in regard to it reached that
country. :- The joint commission, und
er the act of tho last session for carry
ing into effect tho convention with Pe
ru, on tho snbjecit of claims, nas been
organized at L;mn, and is engaged in
tho business intrusted to it.
The difficulties concerning intcr-oc-eanie
transit through Nicaragua, are
in conrse of amicablo adjustment. In
conformity with the principles set
forth wi my last annual message,! nave
received- a representative from tho
United States of Columbia f nd have
credited a minister to that Republic.
Incidents occurring in tho progress
of our civil war have forced upon my
attention the uncertain state of inter
national questions, touching tho rights
of foreigners in this country and of
citizens abroad. In regard to some
Governments, those rights a're at least
nartiallv defined bv treaties. In no
instance, however, is it expressly stip
ulated that, on the instance of civil
war, , a foroigncr, residing in this
country, within the lines of 'the insur
f . gents, is to bo exempted from the rule
which classes him as a belligerent, in
whose behalf tho Government of his
country cannot express any privileges
or immunities from that character. I
regret to say, however, that such claims
r
lie
THE
VOL. 4. NO. 38.
have been pnt forward, and in somo in
stances, in behalf of foreigners who
have lived in the United States the
greater part of their lives. Thero is
reason to believe that many persons,
born in foreign countries, who have
declared their intention to become cit
izens, or who have been fully natural
ized, havo evaded the military duty re
quired of them by denying the fact,
and thereby throwing upon tho gov
ernment tho burden of proof. It has
been found difficult or impracticable to
obtain this proof, from tho want of
guides to the proper sources of infor
mation. Those might bo supplied by
requiring the clerks of courts, . where
declarations of intention may be made,
or naturalization effected, to send, per
iodically, lists of the name of persons
naturalized, or declaring their Inten
tion to become citizens, to tho Secre
tary of tho Interior, i'n whoso depart
ment these names must bo arranged
nd printed for general information.
There is also reason to believe" that for
eigners frequently become citizens of
the United States for the sole purpose
of evading tho duties imposed by tho
laws of their native country, to w.'iich,
on becoming naturalized here, they at
once repair, and though never return
ing to the United States, they still
claim tho interposition of the Govern
ment as citizens. Manjr altercations
and great predjudke have heretofore
arisen out of this abuse. It is there
fore submkted to your serious consid
eration. It might be advisable to fix
a limit, beyond which nocitizen of the
United States, aiding abroad, may
claim the interposition of his Govern
ment. 'J. he right of suffrage hasoiten
boon assumed and exercised by aliens,
under tho pretense of naturalization,
which they have disavowed when
drafted into tho mili'iary fievvlee. I
submit the expediency of such an am
endment of the laws 4is will make the
fact of voting an cstoppe-l against any
plea of exemption from military ser
vice, w other civil obligation, on
gminde of alienage.
In (common with other Western
powers, our relations with Japan have
been brought jnto serious jeopardy,
through tho perverse opposition of
tho hereditary aristocracy of the em
pire to the enlightened and liberal
policy of the Tycoon, designed to
bring the country into the society mf
nations. It is to be hoped, although
not with entire confidence, that these
difficulties may be . peaceful ly over
come I ask your attention to the
Minister residing there for tlie damag
es ho sustained in tho destruction, bv
fire, of tho residence of the legation at
Yeddo.
.Satisfactory arrangements have
been made with tho Emperor of Rus
sia, which, it is believed will result
in effectiri!' a continuous line ol tele
graph across the Atlantic Ocean, and
also of a telegrapli between tins capit
al and tho national forts along the At
lantic seaboard and tho Gulf of Mexi
co. Such connections, established
with any reasonable outlay, would be
economical as well as effective aids to
the diplomatic, military, and naval
services.
The Consular system of tho United
States, under the enactments of the
last Congress, beginsto be self-sustaining,
and there is reason to hopo that
it ma' become entirely so with the
increase of trade, which will ensivj
whenever peace is restored. Our Min
isters abroad have been faithful in de
fending American rights, and in pro
tecting our commercial interests. Our
Consuls havo necessarily had' to en
counter increased labors and respon
sibilities, growing out of tho war.
These they have for tho most part, met
and discharged with zeal and efficien
cy. This just acknowledgement in
cludes those Consuls who, residing in
Morocco, T'gypt, China, and other
central countries, are charged with
complications and extraordinary pow
ers. The condition of tho sevoral organ
ized Territories is generally satisfacto
ry, although tho Indian disturbances
" -SIT- 1 .1 , I .
in JNew Mexico nave not oecn entirely
suppressed. Tho mineral resources of
Colorado, Nevada, Idahoc, Now Mexi
co, and Arizona are proving far richer
than at first understood I lay before
you communications on this subject
from the Governor of New Mexico. I
again submit to j'our consideration tho
expediency of establishing a system for
the encouragement of emigration. Al
though this source of national wealth
is again flowing with greator freedom
than for sovoral years before tho in
surrection occurred.thcro is still a great
deficiency of laborers in every field of
industry, especially in agriculture and
in our mines, as well of iron and coal,
as of precious metals. Wh'lo tho do
mand for labor is thus increased hero,
tens of thousands of persons, destitute
of remuncrativooccupation, are throng
ing our foreign consulates and offering
to emigrate to the Unitod States, if es
sential, but very cheap, assistance can
bo afforded them. It is easy to see that,
under the sharp discipline of civil war,
the nation is beginning a now life.
This nob'o effort demands the aid, and
ought to receive tho attention arid sup
port of the Government. Injuries un
foreseen by the Government, and un
intended, may, in some cases, havo been
inflicted upon the subjects or citizens
of foreign countries, both at sea and on
land, by persons in the United States.
As this Government expects redress
from other powers, when similar inju
ries are inflicted, by persons in their
service, upon citizens of tho United
States, we mus.t be prepared to do jus
tice to foreigners. If the existing ju
dicial tribunals are inadequate to this
purpose, a special court will be author
ized, with power to hear and decide
ancaster
j

such claims of the cliaraetor referred to
as may have arisen under treaties arid
public law. Convention for adjusting
claims by joint commission have been
proposed to somo Governments, but no
defiuito answer to these propositions
has yet been received from nny In tlie
course of tho session I shall probably
have occasion to request you to provide
indemnification to claimants, where
decrees to restitution have been ren
dered and damages awarded by the
Admiralty Court, and in other cases
where this Government may be ac
knowledged to bo liable in principle,
and where the amount of that liability
lias been ascertained by an informal
arbitration. The proper officers of tlie
Treasury have deemed themselves re
quired by tho laws of the United States
upon the subject, to demand a tax upon
tho incomes of foreign Consuls in this
country, while such a demand may not.
bo an indication of public law, or per
haps of any existing treaty between
tho United States and a foreign conn
try. The expediency of so far modi
fying the act as to exempt from tax
tho income of such Consuls as aro not
citizens of tho United States, derived
from the emoluments of their office, or
from property not situated in the
United States, is submitted to your se
rious consideration. I malio this sug
gestion, upon tho ground that a com
ity, which ought to be reciprocated, ex
empts our Consuls in all other countries
from taxation. To tho extent thus in
dicated, tho United States, I think
ought not to bo exceptionally illiberal
to in!ernational trade and commerce.
The operations of tho Treasury du
ring tho last year have been successful-1
ly conducted. The enactment by Con
gress, uf n National Banking Law, has
proved a valuable support of the pub
lic credit, And tho general legislation
in relation to the loans has fully an
swered the expectations of its favorers.
Someamendmeits may bo required to
perfect existing l;i wsj but no change
iu their principles or general scope is
beleived to bo neet'ed. Sinco those
measures have been in operation, all
demands on the Treasury, including
pay of the army and navy, have been
promptly met and fully sutit-ficd. No
considerable body of (roops, it is be
lieved, were ever nioro amply provi
ded, and more liberally and punctually
paid, and it may be added that by no
people were the burdens incident to a
great war more cheerfully borne. The

quarter, and the estimated receipts and
disbursements for the remaining thnc
quarters of tho current fiscal year of
18li4. will be shown in detail by the
report of the Secretary of the Treasury
to which I invite your attention.
It is sufllcient tosaj here, that it is
not believed that, tlio iictnal results will
exhibit a state of finances less formid
able to tho country than tho estimates
of that officer hcretolbro submitted,
while it is confidently expected that at
tho closo of tho year, both disburse
ments and debts will bo found very
considerably less than has been antic
ipated. Tho report of the Socrotary of War
is a document of groat interest. It con
sists of, first, tho military operations of
tho year, detailed in tho report of the
General in-chief; second : tho organi
zation of colored persons into the war
service; third: tho exchange of priso
ners, as fully set forth in tiio letter of
General Hitchcock ; fourth : operations
under tho Act for enrolling and calling
out tho national forces, detailed in tlie
report of tho Provost Marshal General;
fifth: tho organization of tho Invnld
Cords; sixth: tho operation of tho sev
eral departments of tho Quarter Master
General, Commissary General, Pay
master General, Chief of Engineers,
Chief of Ordnanco, and Surgeon Gen
eral. It has appeared impossible to niake
a valuable summary of this report, ex
cept such as would be too extended for
this placo; and, hence, I content my
self by roferring your attention to the
report itself.
The duties devolving on tho naval
branch of the service during the yoar.
and throughout the whole of this un
happy contest, have boon dischargod
with fidelity and eminent success. The
blockade has been constantly increas
ing in efficiency, as tho navy has ex
panded. Yet, on sj long a lino, it hns
so far been impossible to entirely sup
press illicit trade. From he returns
received at the Navy Department, it
LANCASTER, OHIO, DEC.
appears that nioro than one thousand
vessels have boon capflirud sinco the
blockade was instituted, and that the
value of the prises already sent in. for
adjudication .amount to over thirteen
million dollars. The naval force of the
United States consists at this timo of
588 vessels completed and in the course
of completion, and of these seventy-five
are iron -clad armored steamers. The
events, of the war give an increased in
terest nnd importance to tho navy
whih will probably extend beyond
the war itself. Tho armed vessels in
our navy completed and in the service
or which aro under contract and ap
proaching completion, are believed to
exceed in number those of nny other
power; but while these may be relied1
upon for harbor defense and sea coast
service, others of greater strength and
capac'ty will be necessary for cruising
purposes and to maintain our rightful
position on the .cean. The change
that has taken place in the navol ves
sels and naval warfare since the in
troduction of stennft'is a motive power
for ships of war, demands either cor
responding change in some of the ex
isting navy yards or of tho establish
ment of new ones for tho construction
and necessary repair of modern war
vessels. No incomiderable embarrass
mcnt. and delay, and public injury,
havo been experienced from the want
of such Government establishments
The necesity of such n naj' yard, so
furnished, at some suitable place on
the Atlantic seaboard, has, on repented
occasions, been brought to tho atten
tion of Congress by tho Navy Depart
ment, and is again presented in the
report of the Secretary, which accom
panies this communication. I think it
my duty to invite your special atten
tion to this subject, and also that of
establishing u yard and depot for na
val purposes upon one of tho Western
rivers. A naval force has been created
on those interior waters, and under
many disadvantages within a little
more than two years, exceeding in
nu in her the whole naval forro
corntry at the rnmmenccn ent
ot tie
of tl e
priseiit Administration. Satisfactory
and important ns have been the per
forniances of tho heroic men of the
navy, at this period, they aro scarcely
more wonderful than the services of
our mechanics and artisans in tho pro
duction of war vessels, which have cre
ated a new form of naval power. Our
:ouimy nas advantages superior to
any other nation in our resources of
iron and timber with inexhaustible
quantities of fuel in the immediate vi
cinity of both, nnd all accessible nnd
in close proximity to navigable waters.
Without tho disadvantage of public
risks, the resources of the nation have
been developed and its power display
ed in the construction of a navy of such
magnitude, which has at the very pe
riod of its creation, rendered signal
service to tho Union. Tho increase of
the number of seamen in the public
service from 7,0(10 men, in tho spring
of 1801, to about 24,0(10, at the present
time, has been accomplished without
especial legislation or extraordinary
bounties to promoto that increase. It
has been found however, that tho ope
rations of the draft, with tho high boun
ties paid for army recruits, is begin
ning to effect injuriously the naval ser
vice, and will, it not corrected, he like
ly to impair its efficiency by detaching
seamen from their proper vocation,
nnd inducing them to enter the army.
I thcreforo respectfully suggest that
Congress might aid both army and na
val service by adequate provision on
this subject, which would at the same
time b;i equitable to the communities
more cspeeially intended. I commend
to your consideration tho suggestions
of the Secretary of tho Nnvv in reirurd
to the policy of fostering and training
seamen fir naval service. The Naval
Academy is rendering signal service
in preparing midshipmen for the
highly responsible duties which, in
after lfe, they will ho required to per
ioral, in order that the country should
not bo deprived of tho proper quota of
educated ollieers for. which legal pro
vision has been made at tho naval
school. The vacancies caused by neg
lect or omission to mako nominations
from tho ft ites in insiirreeeion, have
been filled by tho Secretary of the Na
vy, the school is now nioro lull nnd
complete than at any previous period
and in ovcry respect is entitled to the
favorable consideration of Congress.
During tho past fiscal year the fiiffin
cial condition of tho Postoffico Depart
mcnt has boen one of increasod pros
peril y, and I am gratified in being
able to state that tho ainounl of postal
revenue has nearly equaled the cntiro
expenditure the latter amounting to
eleven millions, threo hundred and
fourteen thousand dollars and eighty
four cents, nnd the former to eleven
millions, ono hundred and sixty-three
thousand, seven hundred and oighty
nino dollars and fifty nine cents, leav
ing a deficiency of 'but '$150,417 25.
In 18(50, tho year immediately preced
ing the rebellion, tho deficiency
amounted to 85.056,705 49; tho postal
receipts of that year were S2.645.722 19
less than those of 1863. The decrease
sincu 1870 in tho annual amount of
transportation has been only about
twenty-five per cent, but the annual
expenditures, on account of the same,
has boen reduced 35 por cent. It is
manifest, therefore, that the Postoffico
Department may become self-sustaining
in a few years, oven with the res
toration ofthe wholo service. The In
ternational Conference of tho postal
delegates from the principal countries
of Europe ond America, which was
called at the mggestion of the Post
master General, met at Paris on the
11th of May last, ond concluded its de
liberations on the 8th of June. The

principles established by the confer
ence, as best adapted to facilitate post
al intercourse between nations, and as
the basis of future conventions to in
augurate a general system of uniform
international charges at uniform rate
of postage, cannot fail to produce ben
eficial results.
I refer you to tho report of the Sec
retary ofthe Interior, which is here
with laid before you, for the useful and
varied inf irmation in relation to pub
lic lands. Indian affairs, patents, pen
sions, and otber matters of public con
cern pertaining to his department.
The quantity of lands disposed of du
ring the last and the first quarter of
the present fiscal years, was three mill
ion, eight hundred and forty one thou
sand, five hundred and forty nine acres;
of which one hundred and sixty one
thousand, nine hundred and eleven
acres were sold for cash; one million
four hundred find fifty six thousand,
five hundred and fourteen acres were
taken up under tho honn stead law,
and the residue disposed of under
laws granting lands for military boun
ties, for railn ads and other purposes.
It also appears that the sale of the pub
lie lands is largely on the increase. It
has long been a cherished opinion of
some of our wisest Statesmen that the
people ofthe Unit-d States had a high
er and more enduring interest in the
early settlement end substantial culti
vation of the public hinds, than in the
amount of direct revenue to be deriv
ed from the sale of them. This opin
ion has had a controlling influence in
shaping legislation upon the subject of
our national domain. I may cite, as
an instance of this, the liberal mcas
ures adopted in reference to active set
tlers and the grant to the States ofthe
overflowed lands within their limits, in
order to their being reclaimed and ren
dered fit for cultivation. The grant
to railroad companies of alternate sec
tions of land upon the contemplated
lines of toeir roads when completed,
will largely multiply the facilities of
renciiing our distant pfssess't-iis. 'lbs
policy h;is received its in st s:gral i:nd
beneficent illustration in recent enact-'
ments. graining homesteads to act-!
ual settlers. Since the first day of
January last, the before mentioned
quantity of 1,450.514 acres of land has
been take up under its provisions.
This fact. 'nnd the amount of sales, fur
nish gratifying evidence of the increas
ing settlement upon the public lands.
Not withstanding the great struggle in
which the energies ot the nation have
been engaged, and which has requir
ed so large a withdrawal of our citiz
ens f-om their accustomed pursuits.
I cordially concur in the recommend
ation ofthe Secretary ofthe Interior
suggesting n modification ofthe net
in favor of those engaged in. tho mili
tary and naval service of the United
States. I doubt not that Congress will
cheerfully adopt such measures as will,
without essentially changing tlie gen
eral features ofthe system, reserve, to
the greatest practicable extent, its ben
efits to those who have left thirhom.-s
in defense ofthe country.in this ardu
ous crisis.
I invite your attention fo the views
ofthe Secretary of War. as to the pro
priety of raising, by appropriate legis
lation, a revenue from the mineral
lands ofthe United States.
The measures provided at your last
session for the removal of certain Indian
tr'bes, have been carried into effect.
Sundry treaties havo been negotiated,
which will, in due time, be submitted
or the constitutional action of the Sen -
ate. They contain stipulations forex-
tinguishing the possessive rights ofthe
Indians to large and valuable tracts of
land. It is probable that the effects of
these treaties will result in the estab
lishment of permanent friendly rela
tions Willi such ot those tribes as have
been brought into frequent and bloody
collisions with our out-laying settle
ments nnd emigrants. Sound policy
and our imperative duty theso wards
of Govcrnmont. demand our anxious
nnd constant attention to their mate
rial well being, t j their progress in the
arts of civilization, and, above nil, to
that moral training which, under the
blessings of Divine Providence, will
confer upon them theelevated and sanft.
tifying influence of the hopes ond con
solations of the Christian faith.
I suggested in my Inst annual mes
sage the propriety of remedying our
Indian system. Subsequent events
have satisfied mo of its necessity. The
details set forth in the Iteport of the
Secretary will evince the urgent need
for immediate legislative action.
I commend the benevolent institu
tions established or patronized by the
Government, in this District, to your
generous and fostering care.
Tho attention ofCongrcss,duritigthe
last session, was engaged, to some ex
tent, with a position for enlarging the
water communication between thoMis
sissippi Kiver nnd the northeastern sea
board, which proposition, however,
failed for tho time. Since then, upou a
call of tho greatest respectability, a
Convention has been held nt Chicago
upon tho samo subject, a summary of
whose views is contained in a memo
rial addressed to the President andCon

or to lay before you. That this inter
est is one which, ere long, will force
its own way I do not entertain a doubt,
while it is submitted entirely to 3'onr

Augmented interest is givon to this

When Congress assembled n year

many conflicts, both on land and sea.
with varying results. The rebellion
had been pressed back into redu'.od
limits; yet the tono of public feeling
and opinion at home and abroad, was
not satisfactory. With other signs,
the popular eh rctions. then just past,
indicated uneasiness among ourselves,
wbilo amid much that was cold and
menacing, the kindest words coming
from England were altered in accents
of pity that we were too blind to sur
render. Our ' . jimcree was suffering
greatly by a few armed vessels built
upon and famished from foreign shores,
and we were threatened with such ad
ditions from the same quarter, as would
sweep our trade from the sea, and
raise our blockade. We had failed to
elicit from European Governments any
thing hopeful upon tho subject. The
Emancipation Proclamation which was
issued in September was running its
assigned period to the beginning ofthe
new year. A month later, the final
proclamation came, including the an
nouncement that colored men of suita
ble condition would bo received into
the war service. The policy of eman
cipation and the employment of black
soldiers gave to the future a new asnect.
about which hopes, fears, and doubts
contended in uncertain conflict, accor
ding to our political system, as a mat
ter of civil administration. The Gen
eral Government had no lawful power
to effect emancipat'on in any State, and
fr a long time it had been "hoped that
the rebellion could be suppressed with
out resorting to it as a n'ilitary meas
ure. It was all the while deemed pos
siblethat necessity for it might come,
and that if it should, the crisis of the I
contest would then be presented. It
came, as expected, it was followed by
dark and doubtful days. Eleven
months having bet n passed, we are
permitted to take another review. The
rebel borders arc pressed still further!

ly cleared of the insurgent's control
and influence; and the citizens in each,
nnd owners of slaves, and advocates of
slavery at the beginning ofthe rebell
ion, now declare openly for emarif; pa
t.ion in their respective States. Of
those Slates not included in the Eman
cipation Proclamation, Maryland and
Missouri, neither of which, years ago,
would tolerate any restraint upon the
extension of slavery into their territo
ries, only dispute now as to the best
mode of removing it from within their
own limits. Of those who were slaves
at (he beginning of tlie rebellion, fully
one hundred thousand are now in the
United States military service, about
one-half of which number actually bear
arms in the ranks,thus giving thedou
b!e advantage of taking much labor
from the insurgent cause, and supply
ing the places which otherwise must
be tilled with so many white men. So
far as tested, it is difficult to say tnere
arc not as good soldiers as nny. No
servile insurrection, or tendency to j Tae objection to a promnture prescn
vioU'iiee or cruelty; has marked the tat on of a plan by the National Ex-
nieasures ol emancipation and arming
t le blacks.
These measures have been
i much discussed in foreign countries,
j and, cotempory with such discussions,
1 the tone of public sentiment there is
j much improved. The same measures
have been fully discussed, supported,
criticised nnd denounced, nnd tho re
stilt ofthe annual clertions is highly
encouraging to these whose special du
ly it is to bear the country through
this great trial ; thus we have the reck
oning. The crisis which threatened to
divide tho Union is past.
Looking now to the present and fu
ture, and with reference to the
resumption of the national author
ity within the States wherein that
authority has been suspended, 1
have thought fit to issue a proclama
tion, a copy of which isl)'ivwi;h trsns
mitted f n examination 0 the pricia-
clainatioh. it will appear, as is believed,
amply justified by the Constitution.
True, the form of an Oath is given, bat
no man is coerced to take it. A man
is only promised a pardon in case he
voluntarily takes the oath. The Con
stitution authorizes the Executive to
grant iton such terms as are fully estab
lished by judicial ahdoiheranthoritijs.
It is also proffered that it. in many of
the States named, a seat of Government
shall be, In tho mode prescribed. setup,
such Government shull be recognized
and guaranteed by tho Unitod States
and that under it the State shall, on
subscribing to the constitutional con
ditions, be protected against invasion
and domestic violence. The constitu
tional obligation of the United States
to guarantee to every State in the
Union arepublican form ofGovernment
and to protect the State in the case as
stated is explicit and full; but why
tender tho benefits ot this provision
ouly to a State Government set up in
this particular way? This section ofthe
Constitution oon temp'ates a case wherj
iu the clement within a State, favora
ble to Republican Government in the
Union, may bo too feeble for an oppo
site and hostile element external to.and
even within the State, and such are
precisely the cases with which we are
niw dealing. An at. empt to guarantee
and protect a revised State of Govern
ment, constructed in wholo or In pre
ponderating part from the vory ele
ment against whose hostility and vio
lence it is to be protected, is simply
absurd. There must bo a test by which
to separate oppxing elements, so as to

build only from tho sound, and that
(est is a suflieient and liberal one,
which accepts as sound whoever will
makeasworn recantation of thu form
er unsoundness.
Butifit be proper to require ns a
test of admission to the political body,
an oath of allegiance to the Constitu
tion ofthe United States and to the
Union nnder it, why not also to the
laws and proclamations in regard to
slavery? Those laws and proclama
tions were enacted and pnt forth for
the purpose of aiding in the suppres
sion of the rebellion. To give them
the fullest effect there had to be a
pledge f r their maintenance In my
judgement they have aided, and will
further aid, the cause for which they
were enlisted. To give np this prin
ciple would be only to relinquish a lev
er of power, but would also be a cruel
and astounding breach of faith. I may
add, at this poiut. that while I remain
in my present position, I shall not at
tempt to retract or modify the Eman
cipation Proclamation, nor shall I re
turn to slavery any person who is
made free by the terms of the procla
mation, or by any act of Congress.
For these, and other reasons, it is
thought best that tho support of these
persons shall be included in the oath,
and it is believed the Executive may
lawfully claim it in return for pardon
and the restoration of protected rights
winch he has a clear constitutional
power to withhold altogether, or grant
upon the terms which he shall deem
wisest for the public interest. It
should be observed, also, that this part
of the oath is subject to the modifying
and abrogating power of legislation
and snprerie judicial decision. The
proposed acquiespoce of the National
Executive in ary honorable temporary
State arrangement for the freed people,
is made with a view ol possibly modi-
tying the confusion and distressing
destitution winch inus;t, at leafct, attend
all classes, by a total revolution of labor
throughout the whole States. It is
hoped that the already deeply afflicted
people in those States may be some-
what more ready to give up tho cause
this proposition.
The suggestion in the proclamation
as to maintaining the political frame
work of the States on what is called
reconstruction, is made in tho hope
that it may do good without harm.
It will favor labor, and avoid confu
sion. But why any proclamation now
upon the subject? This question is
beset with the conflicting views that
the step might be delayed too long or
be taken too soon. In some of the
States the elements for resumption
have been ready for action ; but re
main innctive, apparently for want of
a rallying point or a plan of action.
Why shall A. adopt the plan of B.,
rather than B. that of A? If A. and B
should agree, how can they know that
the General Government here will
respect their plan ? By the proclama
tion, a plan is presented which msy
be accepted by them as a rallying
point and which will not be rejected
here. This may bring them to act
sooner than thev otherwise would.
!e-utive. consists in the danger of com
mlttals in points which could be more
sai'oiv left to
left to further developments.
Care has been taken to so shape the
document ns to avoid embarrassment
from this source. In saying that, on
certain terms, certain classes will be
pardoned, with their rights restored,
it is not said thnt other classes, on oth
er terms, will never be included. In
saying that, a reconstruction will be
accepted if presented in a specified way,
it is not said that it will be accepted
in no other way. The movements by
State action for emancipation, not inn
eluded in the Emancipation Proclamat
tioti, are matters of profound grntulai
tion ; ami. while 1 do repent what I
havo heretofore so earnestly urged
upon this subject, my general views
and feelings remain unchanged, and I
trust that Consress will omit no fair
opportunity of aiding these important
tep. to the great consummation.
In tho midst of other cases, however
import Rnt, we must not loose sight of
the fact that tho trar power is still our
main reliance. To that power alone
can we look yet, for a time, to give
confidence to'the people in contested
regions, that the insurgent power will
not again overrun theni. U' til that
confidence shall be established, little
can bo done anywhere, for what is
called reconstruct-on. Hence, our
ch iciest care must still be directed to
our army and navy, who havo thus
far borne their harder part so nobly
and well ; and it may be esteemed for-,
tunate that, in giving the greatest
efficiency to their indispensable arms,
we do also honorably encourage gal
lant men, from commander to sentinel,
who compose thetn, and to whoro,irore
than all others, the world must stand
indebted, for the home of freedom,
disenthralled, regenoratod, enlarged,
and perpetuated.
