Accontn.NO to the annual report of
tho state board of health, the Improved
sanitation of Massachusetts remits In
tho saving of over S.OOO lives every year
' from all causes, nnd n largu part of this
saving is dim to unll-toxln. Of tho
cases of diphtheria, two-third are
treated with unti-toxln, and thu facil

remedy was only 10.7 per cent., whllu
thu fatality in thu preantltoxln period
was 28.:t.
A Ni:w American wrinkle is tho cul
ture of rice in artificial swamp-, tho
Invention of Mimu northwestern farm
ers settled In Ioutshina. They build a
bank around a section of prairie and
pump water Into tho inctosuru from
artesian wells. When the crop ma
tures the water is let out, the ground
dried off and reapers and binders se
cure the harvest at greatly reduced
cost. Tho land Is easily prepared for
the next season, and there isuo danger
from drought.
Tint Individual deposits In the na

cording to the report of tho comptrol

000 In tho year ending September 7,
I860, and on that date amounted to
t),450,OOO,O00. Thu Increase for the
year was ISO per cent, and is probably
the greatest single year's gain ever re
ported, except, possibly, In nyear after
a panic, when money that hud been
withdrawn by timid depositors was re
turned after they got over their scare.

Till, designer of tho battleship Ore
gon predicts that within n few years
steel ships 1,000 feet long will bo built
for the l'acl lie trade. Hut hu says the
advaneo will bo gained by gradual In
creases, because It will take tlmu to
' calculate the effect of strain on hulls.
A long hull rests variously on the series
of waves, and there Is also a side roll,
all of which makes It difficult to secure
the right rigidity without practical ex
periments. The advantage of long
ships Is the greater carrying capacity
and the fact that the cost of thu crew
Is no more than on a smaller vessel.

would expect that thu maintenance of

Aa to Tra.ts anil Combination.
The Irdustrlal rummtsslnn, created by the
set of the rouurrsH of Junn IK, ICHs. has Is en
eniraiieil In extended hearliiKs usin the dU
puleil iucKtloiiN ImoHiil In the subject of com
binations In ii-stralut of trade and competition.
They hate not yrt completed their Intcstltra.
Hun of this subject, und the conclusions and
recommendations at which they may arrive are
undetermined. The subject U one. Hiving rlso
li many divergent views as to I ho nature and
variety or cause and extent of the Injuries to
thn public which may irsult from larite combi
nation concciitrtttuiir more or less numerous
enterprise und establishments, which previ
ously to tho formation of the combination were
carried on separately.
It Is universally conceded that combination
nnirii cnurosM or control tho market of any
particular kind of merchandise or commodity
nccc.uary to tho Ktnerul romrqunlly, by sup
prcsslnit natural and ordinary competition,
whereby price aru unduly enhanced to tha
general consumer, am obnoxious not only to
tho (oinuion law, but also to tho pub.lo welfare.
Tncro must Imnn-mcdy for the evil Involved
In such organltatluna. It thn present law ran
ho extended mora certainly to control or check
these monopolies or truils, It should bo done
without delay. Whatever power thn congress
)HMfieaea over tbl moat Important subject
should bo promptly ascertained and asserted.
Au act to protect trade sad commerce against
unlawful restraint sad monopolies was passed
by congress on lbs M of July, ISM. The pro
vWloMof this statute are com prttali sad
strtavent. II declares every contract or com
Nnatlon, In the form of a trust or other
wlse, or conspiracy In tho restraint of trade or
commerce among the several state or with
foreign nation, to be unlawful. It denomi
nate a a criminal any pc. son who make, any
such contract or engages In any such combtna-
ItnM tn winaMr.. and t.t,itl,lA a tittnlthmenl
by fine or Imprisonment. It Invests the circuit j
courts of tha united States with Jurisdiction to
prevent and restrain violation of tho act and
make It the duty of thn several United Stale
district attorneys, under tho direction of the
attorney general, to Institute proceedlnas In
equity to prevent and restrain such violations.
It further confer upon any person who shall
be Injured In hi business or property by any
person or corporation by reason of anything
forbidden or declared to be unlawful by the act
the power to sue therefor In any circuit
court of the United State without respect to
the amount In controversy, nnd lo recover three
fold tho damage by hi in sustained snd the
cost of the suit, Including reasonable sttorncy
fees. It will be perceived that tho act Is aimed
at every kind of combination In tho nature of
it trust or monopoly In restraint of Interstate
or International commerce.
Tho prosecution by tho United States of of
fense under the art of IWJ has Ihy n frequently
resorted to In the federal court nnd notable ef
fort In thn restraint of Inlerstato commerce,
such ns the Tratismlssourl Freight association
and thn Joint Trnfflo association, havo been
successfully opposed and supprcsiil.
Mint Ial.lBlltn Inadequate,
The state, legislation to which President Cleve
land looked for relief from the evils of trust
has failed to accomplish fully that object. Tbl
probablv Is due to a great ext-nt to the fact
that different slates tike different view as to
thnprocr way to discriminate between rill
Injurious combination and those association
which nre bencllclnl nnd necessary lo tho bust,
nrss prosperity of the country. Tho great di
versity of treatment In different state aris
ing from thl cause, nnd the Intimate rela
tion of nil part of tho country to each other
without regarding statn Unci In tho conduct of
business, havo made the enforcement of slate
law difficult.
Itlsapptrcnt that uniformity of legislation
upon this subject In thn several slates I much
tu Imi desired. It Is to be hoped Hint such uni
formity founded In a wlsn and Just discrimi
nation bet wrt-n what Is Injurious and what Is
useful nnd necessary In business operations
may tie obtained, nnd that mean may bo found
for thn congress within tho limitation! of Hi
cfinsiltutlonal power so to supplrmrntan effect
ive risln of state legislation as tn make n com
plete s) stem of law throushntil the United
State adequate lo compel a general observance
of the salutary rules to which 1 have referred.

ixirtnnre of this work rnnnol bo too often or
liMistronglr pressed iiHin the nttentlon of lLo
congress. In my message of a year ago I ex
pressed my view of the necessity of a canal
which would link the two great oceans, tu which
I again Invito your consideration. The reasons
then presented for early action arccven stronger
now.
Our Interest In Chins.
In view of disturbance In the populous prov
inces of northern China, where are many of
our rltlxens, nnd of thn Imminence of disorder
near thn capital nnd townnl the seaboard, a
guard of marines was landed from thn Hoston
und stationed during last winter In the legation
roniiound nt t'eklnf. With thn restoration of
order lid protection was withdrawn. The In
terests of our rltlren In that vast empire have
not lieen neglected during the past yeur. Ade
quate protection has been secured for our mis

hale turn redressed.

I now renew this recommendation, a the Im

I'lrssanl Halation With Orrmanr.
Our relation with Ucnnany continue tn be

by the granting permission In April for tho land

nnd ulso by the conclusion on September S of a

trait In common, Ucnnany rau lie assured of
the most cordial en-operation of thl govern

paths, but our rivalry should tie generous ami

vniirement of each In tho line of lu especial
adaptability,
Th Transvaal War.
Tbl government ha maintained an attitude
of neutrality In the unfortunate contest between
(Irrat llrltatn and the lloer state of Africa.
Wo have remained faithful to tho preceptor
avoiding entangling alliance as to offalr not
of our direct concern. Had circumstances sug
gested that the parties to the quarrel would
havn welcomed any kindly expression of the
hope of the American people that war might bo
averted, good offices would hare been gladly
tendered. The United Stale representative at
Pretoria waa early Instructed to see that all
neutral American Interest lie respected by the
combatants. Thl ha been an easy ta4 In
view of the positive declarations on both llrlt
Isti and lloer authorities that the personal and
property rights of our cltlrcns should be ob
served. Upon the withdrawal of the llrltlsh agent at
Pretoria the United State consul was author
luil, upon tho request of the llrltlsh govern
ment and with tho assent of the South African
ami Orange Freo State government, lo exer
cise tho customary good offices of a neutral for
the rare ut llrltlsh Interest. In the discharge
of Ibis function I am hippy lo say that abuudsnt
opportunity ha been afforded to show the Im
partiality of thl government toward both tho
combatants.

Tha Problem In Cnlia.
The withdrawal of tha'sulhnrlty of Spstn
from the Island of Cuba wH effected by the first
of January, so thst tireTull i-j-i-siabllshmrnt nt
peace found the relinquished territory held by
us In trust for the Inhabitant, maintaining, un
der the direction of tho executive, such govern
ment and control therein a should conserve
public order, restore tho productive condition
of peace so long disturbed by the Instability
and disorder which prevailed for the greater
part of the preceding three decade and build
up that tranquil development of the domestic
state whereby alono can be readied the high
purpose, a proclaimed In the Joint resolution
adopted by tha congress on the IVth of April,
IfW, by which thn United States disclaimed any
opposition or Intention to cxrrrlso sovereignty,
Jurisdiction or control over t?uba, except for the
pacification thereof, and asserted It determi
nation when that was accomplished to leave the
government nnd control of the Island to It peo
ple. Tho pledge contained In thl resolution Is
of the highest honorable obligation and must lie
sacredly kept.
I believe that substantial progress ha lieen
made In this direction. All the administrative
measures adopted In Cuba hnve nlmed tn fit It
lor n regenerated existence by enforcing the
supremacy of law aud Justice) by placing wher

nnd unremitting endeavor of the commission

people of Ihe tien-lle-nt Intent on of th gov
ernment, have had their legitimate effect In
cor lining the great nun of them that prare
und safety and prosperity and stable govern
ment can only le- fou id In n loyal acceptance of
the authority of llio United States.
The future government of the Philippine
rest with the congress of the United state.
Few graver responsibilities luve ever been
confided la u. It we accept them In a spirit
worthy of our race and our traditions, a great
opportunity come with them Tha Island Ho
uudrr tha shelter of our flag. They are our by
every title of law and equity. They cannot
be abandoned. If we desert them we leave
llirm at once to anarchy and finally to barbar
ism. We fling them, a s-oldrn apple of discord,
among the rival power, no one of which could
permit another lo seize them unquestioned.
Their rich plain and valleys would be the
the scene of endless strife and Woodshed. The
advent uf Dewey' deet In Manila bay Instead
of lielng, as wn hope, the dawn of a new day of
freedom and progress, w 11 have been the ban
ning of au era of misery and violence worse
than any which ha darkened thrlr unhappy
past. The suggestion ha been made that we
could icnounca our authority over the Island
and glvo them Independence, cou d retain a fro
trclorate
tm found.
trntioii. Sum an utr.ngrmcnt ru:d Involve
at the outset a cruel breach of faith. Il would
place the peaceable and majority, who ask noth
ing belter than to accept our authority, al the
mercy of armed Insurgents. It would make us
reKinlble for the acttof the Insurgent leader
snd give us no power to control them. It would
charge u with Ihe task of protecting them
against each other, and defending them against
any fori I. n power with which they chose lo
quarrel. In short. It would lake from the con
gress of the United Slates the poser of declar
ing war and vest that tremendous prerogative
tn the Tagalo leader of the hour.
It doe not seem desirable thit I should rec
ommend at thl time a specific and final form
of gov rrnmrnt for these Islands. When peace
shall be restored It will be tho duly of congress
lo construct a plan of government which shall
establish and maintain freedom and order and
peace In tho Philippine. The Insurrection Is
still existing and warn It terminates further In
formation will be required a to the actu.l con
dition of affair before Inaugurating a perma
nent scheme of civil government. The full re
port of the commission, now In preparation,
will contain Information and suggestion which
will be of value to congress and which I will
transmit a soon as It Is completed.
As long as the Insurrection continues the mil
itary arm must necessarily be supreme. Hut
there Is no reason w hy steps should But tie ukea
from time to lime to Inaugurate government
essentially popular In their form a fast as Ur
r I lory I held or controlled by our troop. To
thl end I am considering the advlrablllly at
the return of the commission, or suih of the
member thereof as can be secured, to aid the
existing authorities and facilitate thl work
throughout Ihe Islands. I have believed that
reconstruction, should not begin by the estab
lishment of one central civil government for all
the Island with lis seal at M mils, but rather
that Iho work should t commenced by building
up from the bottom, first establishing raunlel

by their military and naval force; that tha In.

establishment of a beneficent government,
which should afford the fullest security fur llfo

On the 21st of December, after the treaty wa

Thn sumo day, wbllo ordering Hen Oil to see
that the -ace should be preserved In Hollo, he
was admonished that. "11 I most Important
that there should ba no conflict with lha Insur
gent. On the first day of January, IS V. your
general order were reiterated that Ihe kindly
Intentions of this government should tm In
every possible way communicated to the Insur
gent."
On th fist of January I announced my In
tention of dispatching to Manila a commission
composed of three gentlemen of the highest
character and distinction, thoroughly acquaint
ed with the orient, who. In association with Ad
miral Dewey and Ms J. Hen, Otis, were Instruct
ed to "facilitate the most humane and effective
extension of authority throughout the Islands
and tn secure, with Ih least possible delay, tha
benefits of a wise and generous protection of
life and property tn the Inhabitants."
These gentlemen were Dr. JaeobOould Schur
man, president of Cornell University; Hon.
Charlc Denby, for many year minister to
China, and Prof. Dean U. Worcester, of the Uni
versity of Michigan, who had made a most care
ful study of life In Ihe Philippines. While the
treaty of -are was under consideration la the
senate thsx eommllleia set out on their mis

acter was a sufficient guaranty of Ihe beneficent

not borne the positive Instructions of this gov

Hut before thrlr arrival at Manila the sinis
ter ambition of a few leaders of tho Filipino
had created a situation full of embarrassment
for us and most grievous In Its consequence to
