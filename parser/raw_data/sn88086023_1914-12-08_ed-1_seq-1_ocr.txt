UntLsm Keynote of Speech.
WASHINGTON. Dec. . Depart
ing; from the prepared text of his
carefully arranged address to con
gress. President Wilson delivered a
direct message today to the business
Interests of the country.
In effect, he declared that his ad
ministration had completed Its busi
ness on the legislative program and
that hereafter the business Interests
would have a rest from restrictive and
corrective legislation.
This announcement was taken to
mean that business may now proceed,
secure In the knowledge that If It
shapes Its affairs to the existing laws.
It will not find Itself confronted by
sudden changes resulting from new
laws.
Almost at the start, the president
digressed from his set address as or
iginally furnished the press.
He declared that the business pro
gram of congress has been completed
and that now business knows where
It stands.
"The goal at last lies clear and falf
before business" he said. "It la on
the road to unclouded success. It la
a road that every honest man and
every man interested In the welfare
of the nation may walk In perfect
safety. What we have- done In our
own land and for our own people we
have done for the best. What chief
ly strikes us now. as we look back
on the closing year year that will
be memorial In history is that we
face new tasks. They are important
tasks and we must face them with
out partisan feeling. We must real
Ire that America owes a great deal
to herself and also a great deal to
mankind."
The address as prepared bv Presi
dent Wilson and which was furnish
ed to the press, in full Is as follows;

Gentlemen of fie congress: The
session upon which you ar now en
tering will be the closing session of
the sixty third comrress, a congress, I
venture to say. which will be Inn r.
membered for the great body of
thoughtful and constructive wnrtr
which it has done ln loyal response
to the thought and needs of the coun
try. I should like In thli address to
review the notaftle record and try to
make adequate assessment of it; but
ro doubt we stand too near the work
that has been done and are ourselves
tco much a part of It to play the part
of historians toward It.
Moreover, our thoughts are now
more of the future than of the past.
While we have worked at our tasks
of peace, the circumstances of the
whole age have been altered by war.
What we have done for our own land
rnd our own people we did with the
best that was In us. whether of char
acter or of Intelligence, with sober
imhusiasm and a confidence In the
