NEW TREATY WITH
JAPAN IS PROPOSED
California Offers Suggestion to
Settle Trouble Over the
School Question.
SAN FRANCISCO, Dec. 7. Califor
nia proposes a settlement of the im
broglio with Japan over the San Fran
cisco school question on the following
grounds:
Tho Federal Government to enact a
new treatv with Japan, excluding Jap
anese coolie labor from the United
States and Hawaii and American labor
from Japan.
Japanese contract labor importations
to cease.
Equality in public schools, with sep
arate schools for adult Japanese desir
ing primary and grammar school train
ing. A decision by the United States Su
preme court on the State 's right to pass
anti-misccgonation and school laws.
The Federal Government to decide
the right of franchise for the Japanese,
California suggesting' only Federal cog
nizance of Japanese class distinctions
in passing the law.
Keep the question out of the bauds
of Congress.
California, although still frothing
over President Roosevelt's message to
Congress, has begun to quiet down and
study the possible motives behind the
utterances of the chief executive.
That the President really meant what
he said is considered absurd, and while
part of the people still bitterly declare
he was misled, others' declare that the
message is part of a big diplomatic
game and that the President; slapped
California mereb- to gain a deplomatic
advantage by conciliating Japan.
Public men here, probably advised
from Washington, are firm in the con
viction that President Roosevelt and
the Japanese Embassador are framing a
new treaty" which shall exclude the Jap
anese coo'lie class from tho United
States and American labor from Japan.
