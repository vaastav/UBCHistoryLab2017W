The President's Message.
WASHINGTON, December 8.—The presi
dent's.message, after paying a tribute to
the late vice president, and detailing the
peaceful relations of the United States
with foreign powers, says A question
has arisen with the government of Austria
Hungary touching the representation of
the United States at Vienna. Having un­
der my constitutional prerogative ap­
pointed our estimable citizen of urnim
peaciied probity and competence as minis­
ter at that court, the government of Au%
tria-Hungary invited this government' to
take cognizance of certain exceptions
based upon allegations against the pergon­
al acceptibility of Mr. Keiley, appointed en­
voy, asking that, in view thereof, the ap­
pointment should be withdrawn. The rea­
sons advanced were such as could not be
acquiesed in without violation of my oath
of office and precepts of the constitution,
since they necessarily involved limitation
in favor of a foreign government upon the
right of selection by the executive, and re
quired such application of religious test or
qualification for office under the United
States, as would have resulted in a practi­
cal disfranchisement of a large class of
citizens and the abandonment of a vital prin­
ciple in our government. The Austro-Hun
garian government finally decided not to
receive Air. Keiley as envoy of the United
States, and that gentleman has since re­
signed his commission, leaving the seat va­
cant. I have made no new nominations,
and the interests of this government at
Vienna are now in the care of the secre­
tary of the legation, acting as charge de
affairs ad interim.
THE UNITED STATES LARGE ENOUGH.
Maintaining as I do the tenor of the line
of presidents from Washington's day, which
proscribe entangling alliances with for­
eign governments, I do not favor the policy
of the acquisition of new and distant terri­
tory or the incorporation of remote inter­
ests. Our own laws of progress, are vital and
organic, and we must be conscious of that
irresistable tide of commercial expansion,
which, as a concomitant ofour active civili­
zation, day by day is being urged onward
by increasing facilities of production,
transportation and communication, to
which steam and electricity have given
birth. But our duty in the present in­
structs us to address ourselves mainly to
the development of the vast resources of
the great area committed to our charge,
and cultivation of the arts of peace
within our borders, though jealously,
alert in preventing the American hemis­
phere from being involved in the political
problems and complications of distant gov­
ernments thereon. I am unable to recom­
mend propositions involving the perma­
nent privileges of ownership or the right
outside of our own territory when coupled
with absolute and unlimited engagements
to defend the territorial integrity of state
where such interests lie. While the gen­
eral prospect of connecting the two oceans
by means of a canal is to he encouraged, I
am of the opinion that any scheme to that
end ,to be considered with favor, should be
free from the features alluded to. The Te
liauntepec route is declared by engineers of
the highest repute, and by competent scien­
tific men, to afford practicable transit for
vessels and cargoes by means of a ship
railway from the Atlantic to the Pacific.
There is obvious advantages of such a
route, if feasible, over others more re­
mote from the axial lines of traffic be­
tween Europe and the Pacific, and partic
ularlv between the valley of the Missis­
sippi and the western coast of North and
South America, which are deserving of
consideration. Whatever highway may
be built across the barrier dividing the two
ge
reatest maritime areas of the world must
btfilt for the world's benefit and I trust,
for mankind, to be removed from a chance
of domination tfy any single power nor
should it become a point of invitation for
hostilities, or a prize for warlike ambition.
An engagement combining the construc­
tion, ownership and operation of such work
by this government, witn offensive and de­
fensive alliance for its protection, with a
foreign state whose responsibilities and
rights we would have, is, in my judgment,
inconsistent with such dedication to uni­
versal and neutral use, and would, more­
over, entail a measure for its realization
beyond the scope of our national
policy or present means. The construction
of three transcontinental lines of railway,
all in successful operation, wholly within
our territory, and uniting the Atlantic and
Pacific oceans, has been accompanied by
results of the most interesting and impres­
sive nature, and has createcl new condi­
tions, not in the routes of commerce only,
but the political geography, which power­
fully affects our nation toward, and neces
irily increases our interests in, any trans-
isthmian route which may be opened and
employed for the ends of peace and traffic,
or in other contingencies for use inimical
to both.
THE CHINESE QUESTION.
The condition of the Chinese question in
the western states and territories is, despite
restrictive legislation, far from being satis­
factory. The recent outbreak in Wyoming,
where numbers of inoffending Chinamen,
indisputably under the protection of the
statutes and laws, were murdered by a mob,
and the still more recent threatened out­
break of the same character, in Washing­
ton territory, are fresh in the minds of all,
and there is apprehension lest a bitterness
of feeling among the Mongolian race on
the Pacific coast may find vent in a similar
demonstration. All the power of the gov­
ernment should be exerted to maintain
good faith toward China in the treatment
of these men, and the inflexible sternness
in the law in bringing the wrong doers to
justice be insisted upon. Every effort has
been made by this government to
prevent these outbreaks and to
aid the representatives of China in
an investigation of these outrages,
and it is but just' to say they are traceable
to lawlessness'of men not citizens of the
United States engagedin competition with
Chinese laborers. The iace prejudice is
the chief factor in originating these dis­
turbances, and is in a large part of our do­
main jeopardizing our domestic peace and
the good relationship we strive to main­
tain with China. That the exclusion of
Chinese labor is demanded in other coun­
tries where like conditions prevail* is
strongly evinced in Canada, where Chinese
immigration is now regulated by laws
more exclusive than our own. If the ex­
isting laws are inadequate I shall
be prepared to give earnest consideration
to any further remedial measures, within
the treaty limits, which the wisdom of con­
gress may devise.
THE AMERICAN HOG.
"I regret to say that the restrictions upon
the importation of our pork into France
continues, notwithstanding abundant de­
monstration of the absence of sanitary dan­
ger in its use, but 1 entertain strong hopes
that with an understanding of the matter
this vexatious prohibition will be removed.
It would be pleasing to be able to say as
much for Germany,Austria and other coun­
tries where such food products are abso­
lutely excluded.
"The interpretation of our existing treaties
of naturalization by Germany during the
past year, has attracted attention by rea­
son of the apparent tendency on the part of
the temporal government to extend the
scope of residential restrictions to which
returning naturalized citizens of German
origin are asserted to be liable under the
laws of the empire. The temporate and
just attitude taken by this government,
with regard to this class of questions, will
doubtless lead to a satisfactory understand­
ing. The dispute of Germany and Spain
relative to the domination of the Caroline
islands, has attracted the attention of this
government, by reason of the extensive in­
terests of American citizens, grown up in
those parts during the past thirty years,
and because the question of ownership in­
volves the jurisdiction of matters affecting
our citizens under civil and criminal law.
While standing wholly aloof from proprieta­
ry issues raised between powers to botii of
which the United States is friendly, this
government expects that nothing in the
present contention shall unfavorably affect
our citizens in carrying on peaceful com­
merce on their domiciles, and has so in­
formed the governments of Spain and Ger
mauy. The termination of the fishery
clauses of the treaty of Washington must
have resulted in an abrupt cessation, on the
1st of January of this year, in the midst of
their ventures and operations, of citizens of
the United States engaged in fishing in
British-American waters, but for diplomatic
understanding reached witli her maj­
esty's government June last, where­
by assurance was obtained that
interruption of these operations should not
take place during the current fishing sea­
son. I recommend that congress provide
for the appointment of a commission, in
which the governments of the United
States and Great Britain shall be respect­
ively represented, charged with the settle­
ment of tne question of the fishing rights
of the two governments and their citizens,
on the coasts of the United States and Brit­
ish North America. Fishing interests be­
ing intimately related to other general ques­
tions dependant on contiguity, considera­
tion thereof might also properly come
within the perview of such a commission,
to whom correspondence in relation to fish­
ing rights should be submitted. The Arc­
tic explorer steamer Alert, which was
given by her majesty's government to aid
in relief for the Greely expeditition, was,
after successful attainments of that hu­
mane purpose, returned to Great Britain in
pursuance of the authority conferred by an
act of March 3, 1835. The inadequacy of
existing engagements for extradition be­
tween the United States and Great
Britain has long been apparent.
The tenth article of the treaty of
1842, one of the earliest
compacts in this regard entered into by
the United States, stipulated for surrender
in respect of a limited number of offenses.
Other crimes no less inimical to social
welfare should be embraced, and proced­
ure for extradition be brought in harmony
with present international practices. Ne­
gotiations with her majesty's government
for an enlarged treaty upon extradition has
been pending since 1870, and I entertain
strong hopes that a satisfactory result will
be soon obtained.
THE ALASKAN BOUNDABi* LINE.
"The frontier line between Alaska and
British Columbia, as defined by the treaty
of cession with Russia, follows the line of
demarkation assigned in a prior treaty
between Great Britain and Russia. Mod­
ern exploration discloses that this an­
nexed boundary is impracticable as a geo­
graphical factor. In its unsettled condition
the region in question lacked importance,
but the discovery of mineral wealth in the
territory where the line is supposed to
traverse admonishes us that the time has
come when an accurate knowledge
of the boundary line is needful to
arrest jurisdictional complications. 1 rec­
ommend, therefore, that provision be made
for a preliminary reconnoisance by officers
of the United States, to the end of acquir­
ing more precise information of the sub­
ject. I have invited her majesty's govern­
ment to consider with, us the adoption of a
more convenient line, to be established by
meridian observations or by known geo­
graphical features, without the necessity of
an expensive survey of the whole.
"An officer of the navy, detailed for the
purpose, is on his way tQ Siberia, bearing a
testimonial voted by congress to those who
generously succored the few survivors of
the Jeanette expedition. Inadequacy of ex­
isting legislation touching citizenship and
naturalization,demands your consideration.
While recognizing the right of expatria­
tion, no statutory provision exists providing
means for renouncing citizenship by an
American, native or naturalized, nor for
terminating an improper acquisition of cit­
izenship. Even a fraudulent decree of
naturalization can not now be canceled.
The privileges and franchises of American
citizenship should be granted with care
and extended to those only who intend in
good faith to assume its duties and respon­
sibilities when attaining its privileges and
benefits. It should be withheld from those
who merely go through the forms of natur­
alization intent upon escaping the duties
of their original allegiance, without taking
upon themselves those of their new status,
or who may acquire the rights of American
citizenship for no other than hostile pur­
pose toward their original goverments. I
regard with favor the suggestion put forth
by one of my predecessors, that provision
may be made for a central bureau of re­
cord of decrees of naturalization granted
by the various courts throughout the
United States, now vested with that power.
Rights which spring from domicile in the
United States, especially when coupled
with a declaration of intention
to become a citizen, are wortny
of.. definition by statute. The
laws of certain states and territories admit
a domiciled alien to local franchise, confer­
ring on him the rights of citizenship to a
degree which places him in the anomalous
position of being a citizen of the state and
not of the United States, within the pur­
view of federal and international law. It
is important within the scope of national
legislation to define the right of an alien
domicile, as distinguished from federal
naturalization."
THE FINANCIAL QUESTION.
The president, after discussing our com­
mercial relations and opposing treaties
that tend to decrease our revenues, took up
the treasurer's report and said: It fully
exhibits the condition of the public
finances. The ordinary receipts, from all
sources, in the fiscal year ended June 30,
1885, were $322,690,960.38 of this sum $181,
471,939.34 was received from customs and
8202,498,725.54 from internal revenue. The
total receipts, as given above, were .f24,
828,163.54 less than those for the year end­
ing June 30,1884. This diminution em­
braces the falling off of $13,595,550.42 in re­
ceipts for shipment and 89,687,846.97 in the
receipts from internal revenue. The total
ordinary expenditures of the government
for the fiscal year were $200,226,985, leaving
a surplus in the treasury at the close of the
fiscal year of $43,463,774.27. This is $40,
029,854.32 less than the surplus reported at
the close of the previous year. The amount
paid on the public debt during the fiscal
year was $45,993,235,43, and there lias been
paid since that date and up to November 1,
1885, the sum of $369,828. leaving the
amount of the debt at the last date men­
tioned, $1,514,475,860.47. There was, how­
ever, at that time in the treasury appliable
to general purposes of the government the
sum of $66,818,292.38. Total receipts for the
current fiscal year, ending June 30,1886,
ascertained to October 31, 1885, and esti­
mated for the remainder of the year, will
be $315,000,000 expenditures ascertained
and estimated for the same time are
$245,000,000, leaving a surplus at the end of
the year estimateaof $90,000,000. The fact
that our revenues are in excess of the ac­
tual needs of the government justifies
a reduction in the amount exacted
from the people for its support. We should
deal with this subject in such a manner as
to protect the interests of American labor,
which is the capital of our workingmen.
Within these limitations certain reductions
should be made in our customs revenue. I
think a reduction should be made in the
revenue derived from the tax upon im­
ported necessaries of life. Since February,
1878, the government has, under the com
pulsorvprovisions of law, purchased sil
ver bullion and coined the same at the rate
of more than $2,000,000 every month. By
I this process up to the present date 215,
759.131 silver dollars have been coined."
The president here entered into a lengthy
discussion of the question, and ended by
recommending the repeal of the law.
THE INDIAN QUESTION.
"I recommend the passage of a law au­
thorizing the appointment of six commis­
sioners, three of whom shall be detailed
from the army, to be charged with the duty
of careful inspection, from time to time, of
all the Indians on our reservations, or sub­
ject to the care and control of the govern­
ment, with a view of discovering their
exact condition and needs, and determin­
ing what, if any, Indiaus may, with their
consent, be removed to other reservations,
with a view of their concentration what
Indian lands now held in common should
I be allotted in severalty in what manner
I and to what extent Indians upon reserva
tions q^n be placed under protection of
our laws and subjected to their penalties,
and which, if any Indians, should be in­
vested with the rights of citizenship. The
powers and functions of these commis­
sioners in regard to these subjects should
be clearly defined, though they should, in
conjunction with the secretary of the in­
terior, be given all authority to deal defi­
nitely with such questions as are at pres­
ent deemed safe and consistent they should
also be charged with the duty of
ascertaining Indians who might properly
be furnished with implements of agricul­
ture, and of what kind in what case the
support of the government should be with­
drawn where present plan of distributing
Indian supplies shoulcl be changed where
schools may be established, and where dis­
continued what steps shall be taken on be­
half of the government to improve the situ­
ation in the direction of self support and
complete civilization that they ascertain
from such inspection what if any, reserva­
tions may be reduced in area, and in such
cases what part not needed for Indian oc­
cupation may be purchased by the govern­

ment from the Indians, and disposed of for
their benefit.
As far as practicable, the plan adopted
for the disposal of public lands should nave
in view the original policy which encour­
aged many purchasers of these lands for
homes and discouraged the massing of
large areas. Exclusive of Alaska about
three-fifths of the national domain has been
sold or subjected to contract or grant: of
the remaining two-fifths a considerable
portion is either mountain or desert A
rapidly increasing population creates a
growing demand for homes, and
the accumulation of wealth inspires
an eager competition to obtain pub­
lic land for speculative purposes. In
the future this commission of interests will
be more marked than in the past, and the
execution of the nation's trust in behalf of
our settlers will be more difficult. I there­
fore commend to your attention the recom­
mendations contained in my report to the
secretary of the interior with reference to
the repeal and modification of certain of
our land laws. The nation has made
princely grants and subsidies to a system of
railroads, as great national highways to
connect the Pacific states with
the east. It has been charged
that these donations from the people
have been diverted to private gain and cor­
rupt uses, and thus public indignation has
been aroused. An honest discharge of
their obligations and entire justice to all
people in the enjoyment of their rights on
the highways of travel is all the public
asks, and it will be content with no less.
"I am inclined to think there is no sen­
timent more general in the minds of the
people of our country, than is the con­
viction of the correctness of the principle
on which the law enforcing civil service
is based. In its present condition the law
regulates only apart of the subordinate
public positions throughout the coun­
try it applies the test of fitness
to all applicants for the
places, by means of competitive
examination, and gives large discretion to
the commissioners as to the character of
the examination and many other matters
connected with its execution. Then the
rules and regulations adopted by the com­
mission have much to do with the practical
usefulness of the statute, and with the re­
sults of its application. 1 venture to hope
that we shall never again be remitted to a
system which distributes public positions
purely as rewards for partisan service. I
recommend that the salaries of the com­
missioners be increased to a sum more
nearly commensurate with their important
duties, and the people who desire good
government, having secured this statute,
will not •relinquish its benefits without a
protest'
"The present condition ofthe lawrelative
to the succession of the presidency in the
event of the death, disability or removal of
both president and vice president, is
such as to require immediate amendment.
This subject lias repeatedly been consid­
ered by congress, but no result has been
reached. GROVER CLEVELAND.
The Forty-Ninth Congress.
SENATE.
WASHINGTON, December 10.—A bill was
offered today to amend the law providing
for the payment of army officers for lost
property. The bill was alluded to by the
president as being indefinite in its terms. A
bill was also introduced to prohibit gam­
bling in the army.
Senator I'lum introduced the Oklahoma
bill, and said that the Indian territory must
be settled that way or it would settle itself
some other way.
Senator Call introduced a bill to investi­
gate the issue of fraudulent land warrants
and to protect soldiers and sailors from loss
therefrom. It puts the enforcement of its
provisions in tiie hands of the secretary of
the interior.
SENT IN FOR CONFIRMATION.
The president today sent in a number of
nominations for confirmation, all of which
have heretofore, from time to time, been
published. They are principally ministers,
consuls and governors.
Vanderblllt's Sudden Death.
NEW YORK, Dec. 8.—The death of W.
H. Vanderbilt occurred in his residence
today, while in conference with President
Garrett, of the Baltimore & Ohio railroad,
on business connected with the entrance
of the latter road into New York. The
cause of his death was the bursting of a
blood vessel at the base of the brain. Mr.
Vanderbilt had been unusually cheerful,
and in the midst of an animated conver­
sation he fell forward and out of his
chair, and died without a struggle. Phy­
sicians and the members of his family
were summoned, but it was too late, lie
did not utter a word after he was
stricken. The fortune left is estimated at
$200,000,000. at present values. The funeral
will take plane Friday, and the remains
will be interred on Long Island. The de­
ceased would soon have been 65 years
old.
Sparks to be Investigated.
ST. PAUL, Dec. 8.—A Huron special to
the Pioneer Press gives the following:
UNITED STATES SENATE,
WASHINGTON December 8, 1885.)
DEAR SIR: I am in receipt of yours of
November 25th. My attention had already
been called to the extraordinary conduct
of Commissioner Sparks before its receipt.
We shall certainly give his case a fair con­
sideration. The tendency will be
to confirm appointments the result of
resignation* or expiration of term.
The eastern press is full of just such com­
plaints as made by you, and will, no doubt,
receive the serious consideration of the
senate. Yours, JOHN SHERMAN.
To F. L. Ferris, Redfield, Dak.
This letter from Senator Sherman was
drawn out by a complaint by Mr. Ferris of
Commissioner Sparks' rulings on entries of
the public lands.
Far Seeing Germany.
BERLIN, Dec. 10.—The bundesrath has
unanimously approved the bill for the con­
struction of the long spoken of ship canal
between the Baltic sea, the Elbe river and
the North sea. The canal will cost Ger­
many about 156,000,000 marks. It is to be
strongly fortified, and will have a great
military, as well as commercial, value.
Tltl CHIKOSIS.l
A Family Contracts the Dreail Disease hy
Eating a Salad.
PITTSBURGH, PENNT., December 10.—Some
two weeks ago the family of Fred Hause
mer, a well to do German, of Tarentum,
eighteen miles from this city, ate heartily
of salad, of which raw pork, chopped fine,
was one of the principal ingredients, and
last Friday week the entire family con­
sisting of father, mother, three sons and
three daughters, were seized with a terrible
illness, the symptoms in each case
being the same. A distressing diarrhoea
was the first symptom, this was
followed by a feeling of languor and debil­
ity. Acute neuralgia pain followed, with
stiffness of the joints, and then most of the
patients became delirious. The tongues of
the victims became heavy, and so much
were the symptoms like typhoid fever that
Dr. McCuIlough. the family physician, at
first thought it to be that dread disease.
From the suddenness with which they
were stricken down, their house was shun­
ned by the neighbors, who feared they
were suffering from some dread contagion.
The family grew worse, and yesterday
Frederick, aged 20 years, died. John, the
second son. is now so low that he is not ex­
pected to live through the night, and the
rest are at tho point or death. Before Fred­
erick's death the doctor became convinced
that the disease was trichinosis. He se­
cured some of the meat, and, with the aid
of a microscope, found it alive with trich
liue spiralis. The meat was purchased
from a farmer, and was taken from one of
a drove of hogs, which he had raised on his
own farm. Dr. McCuIlough says he ex­
pects another of the family to die tonight,
and has no hopes that any of them will re­
cover.
After Sparks.
ST. PAUL, December 10.—A Plankinton,
Dak., special to the Pioneer Press says: The
following letter has been received by E. K.
Brown, relative to the rulings of Commis­
sioner Sparks.
WASHINGTON, November 30,1885.
E. K. BROWN—Dear Sir: Your favor re­
ceived. Undoubtedly, at the coming ses­
sion of congress the matter to which you
refer wiir be thoroughly ventilated.
Whether it will be possible to right those
wrongs I can not say. An effort at least,
will be made in that direction. Yours,
JOHN A. LOGAN.
ST. PAUL, Dec. 10.—A Mitchell special to
tlie Pioneer Press says A movement has
been set on foot to call a delegate meeting,
from every county in the territory, to pro­
test against Commissioner Sparks' last rul­
ing. A call will be issued in a few days.
Too Many Silver Dollars.
NEW YORK, December 10.—The cham­
ber of commerce had a special meeting to­
day, to take action upon the subjects con­
tained in the president's message in relation
to the repeal of the law in regard to the
coinage of silver dollars. The committee
on finance and currency reported that, af­
ter a careful consideration, they had unani­
mously agreed to support the president of
the United States and the secretary of the
treasury in the stand they had taken in re­
lation to the suspension of the coin­
age of the present silver dollar,
and recommended the adoption of
a resolution to that effect and the me­
morializing of congress to have the com­
pulsory act of February, 1878, repealed.
The report was adopted, and copies or­
dered printed and sent to the members of
congress.
A Conrt Suddenly Dissolved.
ST. PAUL, Dec. 10.—A Pioneer Press
special from Glendive (Mont.) says: The
bar, jorors and people were surprised to
day, by Judge Coburn directing the order
entered and recorded dismissing the jurors
and closing court. The judge explained
by declaring lie had just received notice of
his suspension. lie had served his coun­
try tliree years in the field he had ever
been a good citizen, and, so help liim God,
unlike many of those in power in the cen­
tral government, his hand had never been
raised against it, and never would be. He
said he had been put in office without no­
tice and suspended likewise. Judge Con­
ger, whom Coburn had succeeded, condoled
with him, as he had been served the same
way. The charges against Coburn are said
to be offensive partisanship.
Another Weak Iiridgc.
ST. Jonx, X. B„ December 10.—While the
east bound freight train on the New Bruns­
wick railroad was passing over the north
branch of Oromocto river today, the bridge
gave away, and the engine fell into the
river. Fortunately, it uncoupled itself, and
the cars remained on the track, one hang­
ing over the gap. The engineer escaped
with slight injuries, but the fireman, named
Smith, is missing. The night express from
Boston soon afterward passedover the south
branch of the bridge, and the engineer,
learning of the disaster, attempted to back
his train to Frederick Junction. It was
then discovered that the supports of the
south branch bridge had given away, and
the train had a very narrow escape from a
calamity. Both bridges had been undergo­
ing repairs.
Labor Troubles.
PITTSBURGH, PENN, Df C. 10.—There was
no further trouble at Pine Run, where a
mob assaulted and wounded several men,
but another outbreak is looked for tomor­
row morning. The strikers are camped in
the woods, some distance from- the mines,
but will not allow anyone to approach
them. Suspicious looking men have been
hanging around the mines all day. This
evening Winchester rifles were shipped to
the mines, to be distributed among non­
union men, and bloodshed is quite prob
able.
The Way of the Trangrexsor is Hard."
CINCINNATI, Dec. 10.—Edward O'Neil, a
prisoner charged with counterfeiting, be­
fore the United States court in Covington,
attempted to escape from the court room
this afternoon, and was shot dead by
United States Deputy Marshal Day.

run in across the river to St Boniface,
where Riel's brother Alexander and a
number of half breeds, placed it on a
sleigh and drove it to his mother's home,
at St Vital, where the family were in wait­

Archbishop Tache has issued a manifesto,
in which he lays the blame of the halt
breed uprising on the government officials,
lie holds the metis blameless, and argues
that the Indians are badly treated by the
government He holds that the Indians
were not terrified by the recent executions,
and they have no fear of the military.
There is a danger which the government
should consider to1 avoid mistakes. Refer
ing to Riel, he says the half breeds went
across the border for him to come and lead
their movement, to secure redress of their
grievances. Riel responded, pressed on one
side and encouraged on the other. The in­
considerate attack at Duck Lake was re­
garded by the metis as a declaration of
war, which culminated in the execution of
Riel. Public' opinion is now divided and
embittered. Riel. he believes, was the vic­
tim of manias—brilliant, but erratic. In
conclusion, the archbishop sounds the note
of danger, and asks for a release of the
half breed prisoners.
Itattle With Horse Thieves.
EAGLE PAHS, TEXAS, December 10.—
Sheriff Oglesby, with Robert Dowe and
Jas. Oliver, visited the Delgardo ranche
last evening, with a warrant for the arrest
of Manuel Delgardo, on charges of smug­
gling and horse stealing. The ranche Is
twenty miles below Eagle Pass, on the
Rio Grande, and has been famous for many
years as a general rendezvous for thieves
and outlaws from both republics. A
gang of Mexican smugglers and des­
peradoes made it their headquarters. Ar­
riving at the house, the officers found
Degardo asleep on the lower floor, and
were about to seize linn, when he awoke
and fired at Dowe, the bullet grazing his
head. The sheriff instantly fired, sending
a bullet through Degardo's heart. The fir­
ing aroused the gang, who attacked the of­
ficers and drove them from the ranche. Ob­
taining reinforcements from this place, the
sheriff again attacked the ranche at 5
o'clock this morning. Many shots were ex
changed, and three Mexicans were killed.
The remainder of the gang escaped into
Mexico, carrying several wounded with
them, and taking about thirty horses, all of
which are believed to be stolen. One of the
smugglers was arrested. Much plunder
was found on the premises. Degardo liad
had been a terror to the border, and wasre
puted very rich. It is thought the attack
will result in breaking up tho-worst gang
