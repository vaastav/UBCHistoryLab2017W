Introduced and sent to the printer as
soon ns the House of Representatives
was organized. Very few of these will
ever become laws, but there were bills
inlroducd upon most subjects upon
which Congress Is likely to act. In addition
to the measures of highest Importance,
strong efforts will be mndo
to .secure changes In the bankruptcy
law, the establishment of an executive
department of commerce, and some
geneiul law In regard to telegraphic ca
bles. "Anti-fraud" legislation will be
strongly pressed, especially with regard
to the sale o oleomargarine nnd "shoddy
woolens." A bill for a "reciprocity
commission" was one of the measures
Introduced yesterdny, which probably
provides for a commission to study the
subject for a few years and report upon
It before action Is taken. Doubtless one

many important subjects to be dealt

Thu protective policy, the president
.says, has general acquiescence, and it

message calls attention to tho Inequalities
of the rates of pay of American

of running tho ships, as well un the fact
that the competing carriers aro subsidized,
and urges action which will remedy
the Inequalities.
The president commends tho act fixing
