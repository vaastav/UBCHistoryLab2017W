LET THE PEOPLE SPEAK OUT
President Wilson’s message to
Congress lays chief stress on the
necessity for the completion of
his program of settlement and
regulation growing out of the
recent dispute between the rail
road trainmen and their employ
es. One of his recommendations
in that connection, that involving
Congressional approval of rate
increases'by the Interstate Com
merce Commission to compensate
railroads for losses caused by the
adoption of the eight-hour day,
he now withdraws. There in no
doubt of the Commission’s power
to do this, he says, and he fears
that action by Congress might
seem to draw in question the
scope of the Commission’s au
thority of its inclination to do
justice. His other recommen
dations he earnestly renews.
Chief of these, of course, is
the President’s request for an
act modeled upon the Canadian
plan making a strike or lockout
illegal pending full public inves
tigation of the merits of the par
ticular dispute involved. Organ
ized labor is against such a law.
The brotherhoods have announ
ced that they will fight it. They
, will doubtless bring all possible
pressure to bear upon Congress
in order to defeat it. Yet the
simple, big, supreme fact re
mains--it was brought home to
the people with compelling force
recently when a general strike of
the railroad trainmen was threat
ened—that without some such
law the people of the country at
any moment are likely to be
thrust into an intolerable posi
tion.
A general strike in these days
means something entirely diff
erent from the strike of a few
years ago. With the' latter the
chief parties involved were the
employes and the employers.
The public was affected but in
cidentally and to a limited extent
With a general strike, however,
the public is the chief sufferer.
Such a strike as that threatened
a few months ago, if it had come
to pass, would have meant suffer
ing and loss incalcuable to hun
dreds of thousands of
in our large cities. It would al
most certainly have meant riot
ing and starvation, bloodshed
and death. Should the people of
a democracy or their represent
atives fail to act in the face ol a
situation like this, it would
amount to a virtual confession
of their incapacity to govern.
For them or their representatives
to be intimidated by organized
labor or any class or organization
would be a confession of despi
cable cowardice.
Compulsory investigation is
not an invention of Mr. Wilson’s.
It is not an untried scheme. It
represents the best thought of
economists generally as to the
next forward step, in the hand
ling of labor disputes. It is far
less drastic, far more likely to
work satisfactorily, than com
pulsory arbitration, which is
about the only alternative that
has been proposed. It is, indeed,
a significant thing that organ
ized labor, which* has declared
against the compulsory investi
gation idea, has itself offered no
alternative proposal. It realizes,
as everyone else, that absolutely
defenseless position of the public
under present conditions. It
knows how impossible that posi
tion is. Yet it suggests no
remedy.
Had the strike really taken
place last summer, had the
people really felt the pinch of
hunger and famine, had the
great cities of the country seen
their milk supply exhausted in a
day, their perishable food pro
ducts gone in three or four days,
their supplies of all sorts dwind
ling, prices going up, labor riots
and food riots occurring, thous
ands facing destitution in the
midst of plenty, Congress would
have hurried to pass any meas
ure that seemed to promise re
lief, no matter how revolution
ary. Public sentiment would
have made itself felt very cer.
tainly and quickly. If the
people are wise, they will ex
press their opinion no less em
phatically now. They will let
their representatives at Wash
ington know that something
must be done to prevent a re.
currence of such a situation as
resulted in the passage of the
Adamson law. some hidden
J genius has a better plan than 1
1 that of President Wilson’s, let it
jbe brought forth. But let there
| be no failure to act.
K j The President has done his
part. It is now up to the people
of the country to do theirs.

Europe Lacks Goods To Dump
‘(’American business men who have all
. along maintained that the industries ot
this country, especially textiles, are not
in danger of being swamped at the end
of the war by a flood of European good*
3 at this market are sustained in their
assertions, accordidg to F. A. Landis
, of the H. B. Ciaflin Corporation, by the
* difficulty experienced by buyers in find
i
ing sufficient merchandise abroad to
0 supply the needs of even the next half
year or so. Mr. Landis recently re
turned from an extended European trip
in the interests of the department he
3 manages. This is the fifth trip he has
? made since the beginning of hostilities,
1 having visited Germany, Austria, Swit
. zerland, England, France and Ireland.
“The much discussed prospect of
dumping by European nations at the
® end of the war is a delusion,” said Mr.
, Landis, as there are no surplus stocks
0 being offered, not even Germany having
j. any goods to dispose of. In fact, some
American importers who have had Ger
s man merchandise lying in Rotterdam
t awaiting the permission of the British
B government to ship, are reselling it to
- German merchants at prices represent
-2 ing a moderate profit.
“The opinion prevails in Europe as in
certain quarters here, that prices will
not drop immediately after the war; the
3 readjustment is likely to come gradually.
1 There is no doubt that labor will endea-
vor to remain on the present war-wage
, basis as long as possible, and with ad
ditional taxes to be levied on the entire
' population to pay for the great waste
-of the war, merchandise must in the
- nature of things, continue high.
“In January a further call for ‘man
power,- 1 is to be made for the army,
which will include men in class ‘CI, C 2
‘ and C 3, ’ who have been previously re
-2 jected as being unfit for military service,
g There are approximately 40,000,000 men
3 engaged in fighting and another 7,000,-
000 employed in making munitions, &c.
It is only logical that with such a tre
-3 mendous number of workers being taken
J away from legitimate monufacturing
f and commercial pursuits, even more
unusual conditions will develop as time
goes on.

a j ‘
in Europe, it will be many months, if j
j not years, befoi'e the various industries
are running up to their former capacity.
Circumstances of this nature make it
rather impossible to predict just what
conditions will be after hostilities have
ceased, but several American houses
have already bought foreign goods for
1918 business in anticipation of even
more serious obstacles to delivery by
that time than exist at present.
“At the outbreak of the war import
ers generally came to the conclusion
that production and shipments of goods
from Eusope would practically cease.
The result was that large stocks were
bought at inflated prices. It took them
some time to dispose of these goods
and to forget the sting of their unwise
and hasty judgment. The unfavorable
conditions that were expected to ma
terialize the first year of the war have
now fully developed.
““The most alarming situation from
the buyer’s point of view, is the grow
ing scarcity of desirable merchandise.
Some lines are not to be had at all, and
others are obtainable only in small
quantities. Manufacturers are not de
sirous of accepting contracts for later
delivery. They prefer to sell goods
they have on hand’ which are not al
ways the most acceptable.
“If the trade on this side of the At
lantic could see first hand the existing
conditions abroad they would feel that
now offered are cheap. They
wotTO see that Europe’s most serious
occupation is crushing the enemy,
business being a secondary consider
ation.
“From what can be learned abroad
there is a possibility of the war lasting
until 1918. This is the opinion of many
people in civil life as well as military
circles, but after all it is only a guess.”
