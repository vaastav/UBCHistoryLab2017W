Senator Dryden in explaining how his

An opponent of double statehood for
New Mexico and Arizona says, "We

but New Mexico and Arizona are apt

they are likened to Rhode Island and
New York.
Senator Burton will not be the only
absentee from Washington. Senator
Piatt has gone home to New York for
the holidays, after which he will go to
a resort down in Virginia to remain
"Indefinitely." Some public servants
don't believe in working at it very hard,
but there Is Teally no great loss.
There seems to have been this dif
ference between the grafting of Sena
tor Mitchell and that of Senator Bur
ton: Mitchell was drawn into it grad
ually long after he had gone to the
senate and he profited but little by it
personally, while the Kansas senator
appears to have hud that object in view
in securing his election to the senate.
In referring to the fact that Senator
Burton is now without a committee
assignment, the Lawrence Journal
says, "This means that Kansas will be
without an active senator until the end
of Burton's term." It has been sup
posed that Senator Long is reasonably
active in the senate In most matters,
but the Journal doesn't seem to
think so.
Senator Bailey of Texas says he "will
support the president when the presi

report is true that a truce has been

Henry J. Allen is to have the nomina

that he is the real choice of the dis

worst of it from the politicians. We
believe, too, that Allen will make good
in congress If he is given a. chance. This
opinion Is not confined to Republicans,
but is shared by Democrats who repre
sented the city when he was chairman
of the state board of charities. Allen
represented the state so well that he
made that road cost Atchison a great
deal of money. He held his own against
Jim Orr, and that's doing a lot In the
opinion of Atchison people."
KELLY'S "VINDICATION."
There seems to be an attempt in
several quarters to create the impres
sion that the forthcoming report of the
state accountants will "vindicate" State
Treasurer Kelly.
The recent story in a Kansas City
paper alleging that no shortage in the
state treasury has been found under
Kelly's administration, but that there
is a shortage of $7,000 during the
Grimes administration, is made the
basis for this attempt. In some in
stances this story has been accepted
for the report itself, and it has been
said that it refutes the Rowett report.
Governor Hochs denial of any
knowledge of the matter indicates that
the story emanated from the region of
the treasurer's office. How much truth
there is in it the State Journal does not
know.
In regard to the Rowett report: Mr.
Rowett and his assistant, the Moxey
Audit company, simply gave the fasts
as they found them in the records.
For instance, in recording an irregular
ity they simply stated that certain
bonds were purchased by the state
school fund commission on a certain
date; that a certain number of cou
pons were recorded on them; that cer
tain of these coupons were paid on a
given date but that the money was not
accounted for in the state treasury. In
some instances these coupons were
stamped as state property and in some
instances they were not.
The State Journal is under the im
pression that the name of T. T. Kelly
does not appear in the Rowett report.
The report does not attempt to say
who got the money. It only gives the
instances in which, according to the
records, coupons were paid and not ac
counted for. The Rowett report, which
covers only 55 of the 105 counties, is
said to show that something like $14,-
000 of these coupons were stamped as
state property but never accounted
for; about $3,000 more was paid into
the treasury secretly or under sus
picious circumstances when the thefts
were discovered; and over $20,000 of
additional coupons were not stamped
as state property but were purchased
by the state, according to the records.
It is true, too, that the greater part
of these shortages found in the 55
counties by Mr. Rowett were under
the Grimes administration. Why then
was Kelly suspected of the thefts?
First, because of his record as an
embezzler in Miami county, in connec
tion with the fact that, as assistant
state treasurer, he actually handled
the money during the Grimes adminis
tration.
Second, in the Garden City case.
which was one of the few shortages
found since Kelly became state treas
urer, it was discovered that Kelly had
the coupons in his possession and per
sonally sent them to the fiscal agency
in New York, where they were paid,
and directed that the money be sent to
him personally. The money was so
sent to him and he cashed the draft.
That placed the money in his hands
and that is as far as it was traced
until the mysterious "A. R. Brown"
letter turned up over a year later, pur
porting to pay this money into the
treasury.
That money was the property of the
state school fund and if Kelly paid it
to "A. R. Brown" he is responsible for
the theft. Futhermore "A. R. Brown"
had no way of knowing Mr. Rowett
was investigating the Garden City
matter unless he was informed
through the state treasurer's office.
Unless the forthcoming report clears
up these matters it is difficult to see
how Kelly is "vindicated." Incidentally
it might be remarked that Kelly sent
in three other sets of coupons along
with the Garden City coupons, with
the same instructions concerning them.
What became of them the State Jour
nal has never found out.
Again, it was Kelly who knew all
about the $1,300 of Bourbon county
taxes that was not accounted for early
in the Grimes administration, and it
was Kelly who hastened to make it
right when it was accidentally discov
ered by the Bourbon county treasurer
in correspondence with the state audi
tor. The money was not accounted for
for over two years after it was paid into
the treasury and Kelly wrote the treas
urer that it was "one of those things that
you cannot explain." Then he tried to
explain that it was credited to some
other county, which was contradicted
by Treasurer Grimes. i
Where was the Bourbon county $1,300
during those two years, and why was it
Kelly and not Mr. Grimes who hastened
to make it right when the shortage was
discovered?
These are some things that need an
other "vindication."
In addition something might be said
of Kelly's well-known misuse of the
state's funds during the past few
months, incidents that have nothing to
do with the Grimes administration;
such matters as his embezzling $123,000
to finance the Comanche county bond
deal; his depositing more than half 'a
million dollars of state money in the
defunct First National, contrary to law;
his depositing of funds in other favored
banks, which was absolutely prohibited
by law; and his illegally taking $2,000
from the state treasury to reimburse
himself for a bond he did not pay for
in the first place.
When is Kelly to be "vindicated" for
comiEitttnff these crimes?, , , i
TOM WAG STAFF AGAIN.
County Attorney Wagstaff of Mont
gomery county is again demonstrating
that he is the right sort. After filling
the county jail so fuil of jointists that
the Labette county jail had to be bor
rowed to hold the overflow, the usual
"taxpayers" came forward to petition
the county commissioners to turn the
jointists loose on the ground that it
was costing too much to punish them.
But Mr. Wagstaff came forward also.
As the legal adviser of the county com
missioners he addressed a legal opinion
to them pointing out that they have no
power to release prisoners from the
county jail when they are serving sen
tences imposed by a court; that such
power lies in the governor alone. Inci
dentally he mentioned the fact that if
the commissioners do turn any of the
jointists loose prior to the expiration of
their jail sentences he will consider it
his official duty to bring proceedings
against the commissioners for malfeas
ance of duty, and the reputation he has
established is sufficient guarantee that
he would do so to make the commission
ers hesitate some time before going con
trary to his advice, even if they wish
to do so.

True it was started by Topeka men
but everything must start from some

ready for the immigration that is look

really a united effort to get people to
Kansas. We have a great state and yet

yet year after y-,-&r they increase little
more than the birthrate. It is time
we were looking these things squarely
in the face and acting accordingly.

KELLY'S FRIENDS.
The friends of Tom Kelly have sprung
a scheme whereby they will attempt to
throw the blame of the shortage in
the state treasury onto the shoulders of
Frank Grimes, Kelly's predecessor.
They claim that the shortage occurred
in Grimes' term of office and then
throw in a few compliments for Grimes
to the effect that he is an honest man.
Of course he is an honest man. No one
ever doubted it, but Kelly isn't. Tom
Kelly was assistant treasurer for
Grimes, and his friends claim further
that the shortages occurred when Kelly
was out campaigning. Every man has
occasion to complain of the inactivity of
his friends, but Tom Kelly can't com
plain. No man in Kansas deserves
friends less, or has friends more active.

to be subject to a tax of 5 or 6 per cent.

Beet Prices in California.
Already arrangements are commencing
to be made by the sugar company for
contracting the 1906 beet .crop, says the
Chino Champion. The company has de
cided upon the schedule of prices to be
paid next year, and now makes an
nouncement that they will average to
farmers an increased price for their
beets. The minimum price will be $3.50
per ton, which will be paid for 11 per
cent beets. For each additional percent
age of sugar about 11 per cent there will
be paid' 25 cents per ton additional up
to and including 15 per cent, making 15
per cent beets pay $4.50 per ton. Above
15 per cent for each additional per cent
of sugar 30 cents per ton will be paid.
On this schedule 16 per cent beets will
pay $4.80 per ton; 17 per cent, $5.10; 18
per cent. $5.40; 19 per cent, $5.70, etc. It
is estimated on the percentages of the
past years that this will be an average
encre;use of 35 cents a ton on an ueeis
raised for this factory. It will be noticed
that this puts a premium especially on
beets of high quality, although it makes
a minimum of 11 per cent instead of 10
as heretofore. It is believed that this
contract Will result In an increased
acreage being planted. The contracts
will be prepared in a few days. Chino

j THE EVENING STORY
A Gentlemanly Robber.
By C. B. Lewis.
Miss Lucy Davis, 20 years old and the
daughter of a widow, was assistant
bookkeeper and assistant cashier of the
Flint Woolen mills, in the suburbs of a
certain western city. It was one of
the duties of the cashier to go to me
bank in the city every Saturday fore
noon and draw an amount sufficient to
pay the wages of the employes, and he
had never met with any adventure in
so doing. One was coming, however.
There came a day when a stranger
recognized him and tried to possess
himself of the $2,500. He went over the
ground from the bank to the mills and
laid his plans, and a week before the
event he felt certain that the boodie
was his.
"Look here. Miss Davis," said the mill
manager one Saturday forenoon. "I
have word that Mr. Samson is sick and
won't be down this morning. At 10
o'clock you will have to go to the bank
in his place. You can go down on a
street car and come back in a hansom."
The young lady was rather pleased
and proued over the errand, and when
the hour arrived she set out with never
a thought that it was to be an eventful
day in her life. As she boarded a car
in front of the mill a good-looking
stranger about 30 years old got in and
sat opposite her. Although she could
not say that he ever glanced at her,
she had several sly peeps at him and
was quite favorabey impressed with his
appearance.
The check was promptly cashed at
the bank, and with the money in her
reticule the girl reached the door to find
an empty carriage drawn up as if
awaiting her.
"Keb, ma'am?" queried the drivef,
and next moment she was inside and
being whirled away.
Miss Davis was so occupied with
thoughts of something else that she did
not notice the landmarks along the
way. When the hack suddenly stopped
she looked out and saw that she had
not arrived at the mill. Instead of
that she had arrived at a lone old house
standing alone on the block, and the
neighboring was one she had never seen
before.
She sprung to the ground and began
to question the driver, but he wheeled
and drove off without a reply, and out
of the house stepped the man of the
street car and raised his hat and bow
ed and smiled.
"Where am I? What does this
mean ?" asked the girl.
"If you will step inside I will ex
plain." replied the man.
"But I shall not step inside. Why
did the carriage bring me here? I
shall not stay a minute."
But she did. The man stepped for
ward and passed an arm around her
and carried her within in spite of her
struggles. He seated her on a box in
a bare room and smilingly said:
"Excuse me, please, but you were
acting a bit foolish. You have asked
several questions, and I will now pro
ceed to answer them.
"You are in the suburbs. You were
brought here to be robbed. You will
be detained a few hours and then set
at liberty. Had the cashier gone to the
bank for the money he would now
have been in your place. You will be
held blameless in this matter, and
vou must see that you are also perfect
ly helpless. Better take a sensible
view of things. How much money did
vou draw ?"
"About $2,600," she replied as sh
handpd ovnr the reticule.
"Not a fortune, but fair pay for a
day's work. Now, then, you have got
to endure my society for an hour or
two, and I hope you will try to make
the best of it. r
The door had been locked. He
raised a window. drew up another
box and continued:
"We may as well be sociable as to
sit here and sulk. Has the thought
ever occurred to you that you would
he a heroine some day .'
"I never expected to fall into the
hands of a robber."
"It was foreordained that you were
to become a heroine that way. Your
story will create a sensation. The three
dailv Daners will send reporters to in
terview you. They will publish your
picture. They will describe the color
of vour hair and eyes praise your
small hands and feet tell how cool and
calm vou were in facing the robber.
You will be called one of the most
hpantifiil sirls in the state."
"You are impudent," said the girl
with a toss of her head.
"Then forgive me. If you are not en
gaged you will have a score of oppor
tunities to become so. You will receive
letters from all over the state. As
heroine you will be pointed out on the
street, and the reporters will follow you
home and write articles on now you eai
and sleep your old shoes your likes
and dislikes whther pickles agree with
you or give you headache, bongs may
be composed and sung in vour honor,
and it is certain that a brand of cigars
will be named after you. Fame is sure
i aint trt knock at the door."
'rtiit T want none of it," responded
Miss Davis. T want to appeal to your
better nature to give me that money
and let me go. you say you are a ion-
ber but I am sure you are also a gen
tleman and not without honor and sen
timotlt "
Vm T am a gentleman by birth and
education, and I have my fair share of
optitiment. but this is a worldly matter
and must be discussed from a worldly
av,rir,r,irit. You have read in the pa
pers, haven t you. in-' mt ua)i

'Yes.

dictment and two more suspected,- while
a building inspector has had to leave
the country to escape arrest. You kne-n
that, didnt you.'
Yes."
woii enme of them, at least, are
gentlemen, and all have more or less
t-iimnt but has anybody appealed
to them on that score to surrender
tbolr hoodie?
I i guess not. But because an
other man commits crime you can not
be excused," replied the girl.
"That is ancient history," smiled the
man ""There has been a new deal on
for the last fifty years. In our haste
to get rich we have put principle be
hind us. The motto of the average
man todav is: 'Get rich as fast as
vou can and any way you can. but
don't get caught at it.' We haven't
any use for the strictly honest man
for manv years past. He was sent to
the poorhouse and died there before
you were born. I freely admit that
because some bank president steals the
funds it doesn't follow that I am li
censed to rob, but it does follow that
if I am to get ahead in the world I
must meet men on their own ground.
For instance, the Flint Woollen mills
are supposed to turn out woollen
clothes. As a matter of fact, they are
mixing cotton with their goods and de
ceiving the public for gain. The pub
lic must get even or get left. I am
one of the public' '
"All this is rank sophistry," said
Miss Davis when he had finished.
"Granted, my dear, but you can not
get over the. fact that I have the
money."
"And vou will not return it?"
"I would not deprive you of the
fame that awaits you. The chances
are even up that this will bring you
a rich, husband, I am now fc-.n----r to ,
take my departure. The door will ba
locked behind me, and you can't raisa
any of the sashes high enough to en
able you to creep out. An hour hence
the door will be unlocked and you will
be at liberty to go. I hope you wilt not
blame me individually. I am as hon
est as other men no more nor less.
Goodby to you."
And in telling her story a hundred
times over within the next ten days the
girl always took pains to add: t
"He was a robber, but he -was a
gentleman. I was really ashamed to
ask him to give me back the money."
