Text of President Wilsons Message Before 66th Session of Congress December 2,
The text of the president's message
to congress follows:
To the senäte and house of repre
sentatives:
I sincerely regret that I cannot be
present at the opening of this session
Of congress. 1 am thus prevented
from presenting In as direct a wav as
I could wish the many questions that
ore pressing for solution at this time.
Happily. 1 have had the advantage of
the advice of the heads of the several
executive departments who have kept
In close touch with affairs In their de
tail and whose thoughtful recommen
tations I earnestly second.
In the matter of the railroads and
the readjustment of their affairs,
growing out of federal control, I shall
take the liberty at a later date of ad
dressing you.
ADVOCATES BUDGET SYSTEM.
I hope that congress will bring to
a conclusion at this session legisla
tion looking to the establishment of
a budget system. That there should be
one single authority responsible for
the making of all appropriations and
thnt appropriations should be made
not independently of each other, but
with reference to one single compre
hensive plan of expenditure properly
related to the nation's income, there
can bo no doubt. I believe the bur
den of preparing tho budget must, in
the nature cf the case, if the work is to
be properly done and responsibility
concentrated instead of divided, rest
upon the executive. The budget so
prepared should be submitted to and
approved or amended by a single com
mittee of each house of congress and
mo
a,dedbythe
•«.VW.*? , IUUDC
no single appropriation should be made
by the congress, except such as may
have been included in the budget pro
pared by the executive
committee charged with the budget
Another and not less Important
nspect of the problem is the ascertain

Thc auditors should lie highly

of obligations to or motives of ronsld

ministration and authoiized and em

the results obtained bv tlie executive
departments of the government. Their
reports should be made to the con

SIMPLIFYING TAX PROBLEM.
I trust thnt the congress will give j
Its immediate consideration to the |
problem of future tatxation. Simpli
lication of the income and prollts' j
taxes has become an immediate neees- :
sity. These taxes performed indispon- |
gable service during the war. They
must, however, be smpllfied, not only |
to save the taxpayer inconvenience
and expense, but in order that his lia
bility may be made certain and defi
ni le.
With reference to the details of the
revenue law, the secretary of the
treasury and the commissioner of in
ternal revenue will lay before you for
your consideration certain amend
ments necessary or desirable in con
nection with the administration of the
law—recommendation which have my
approval and support.
It is of the utmost importance that
in dealing with this matter the present
laws should not be disturbed so far
as regards taxes for tho calendar
year 1920», rmyable in the calendar
year 1921. The congress might well
consider whether the higher rates of
income and profits taxes can, in peace
times, be effectively productive of
revenue, and whether they may not,
on the contrary, be destructive of bus
iness activity and productive of waste
and inefficiency. There Is a point at
Which, in peace times, high rates of
Income and profits laxes discourages

FUNDAMENTAL CHANGE.
'
dice and passions engendered by de- j
cades of controversy between two
schools of political end economic
thought—the one behexe:, in pr°- !
taction of American Industries: the
other believers in tarif lor revenue
oniy—must be subordinated to the ,
whole consideration of the public in- j
terest in the light of utterly changed
conditions. Before the war. America
was heavily the debtor of tlie rest of
the world and the interest payments
ehe had to make in foreign countries

ere abroad and the ocean freight
charge's she had to pay to others.

greatly stimulated and Incerased prices
have increased their value. On the

this country of gold or goods or by
establishing new credits.
Europe is In no position at the
present time to ship gold to us nor
could we contemplate large further
Imports of gold into this country with
out concern. The lime has nearly
Passed for international governmental
loans and it will take time to develop
lu tliin country a market for foreign
securities. Anything therefore, which
would tend to prevent foreign countries
from settling for our exports by ship
ment of goods into Hits country would
only have the effect of preventing them
from paying for our exports and there
fore of preventing the exports from
being made. The productivity of tho
country, greatly stimulated by the war.
must find an outlet by exports to for
elgn countries and any measure taken
to prevent Imports will inevitably cur
tail exports, force curtailment of pro
duction, load the banking machinery
of the country with credits to carry
unsold products and produce indus
trial stagnation and unemployment. If
we want to sell we must be prepared
to buy. Whatever, therefore, may
have been our views during th* period
of growth of American business con
cerning tariff legislation xyo must now
adjust our own economic life to a
changed condition growing out of the
fact that American business is full
grown and that America is the great
est capitalist in the world.

There are other matters of Import

last session of eongiess which are still
pressing for solution,
1 tun sure it Is not necessary for me
again to remind you that there is one
immediate and very practicable ques
tion resulting from the war which we
should meet In the most liberal spirit,
It is a matter of recognition and re
lief to our soldiers. I can do no bet
ter than to quote from my last mes
«s Be urging this very action:
"We must see to it that our return
<>ir soldiers are assisted in every prac
t( ,. ab)e way to fi nd the places for
which they are fitted in the daily work
of tho country. This can be done by
developing and maintaining upon an
udequate scale tlie admirable organi
zatlon created by the department of
labor for placing men seeking work;
and it can also be done in at least one
very great field for creating new op
portunities for individual enterprise."
TARIFF LEGISLATION

TARIFF LEGISLATION
In the matter of tariff legislation, I
beg to call your attention to the state
ments contained in my last message
urging legislation with reference to tlie
establishment of the chemical and dye
stuffs industry in America:
"Among the industries to which
special consideration should be given
Is that of the manufacture of dyestuffs
end t ela ted chemicals. Our complete
dependence upon German supplies be
fore the war made the interruption ot
trade a cause of exceptional economic
disturbance. The close relation be
tween tho manufacture of dyestuffs on
thf one hand and of explosives and
poisonous gases on the other, moreover
has given the industry an exceptional
significance and value. Although the
I United States will gladly and unhesi
! tntingly join in the programs of in
I tcrnational disarmament, it will never
! theless be a policy of obvious prudence
j to make certain of the successful main
, tenanee of many strong and well
I equipped chemical plants."
During the war the farmer perform
a vital and willing service to the
tion. By materially increasing the

and fuller provision for sanitation in

deairftble reforms by a fresh, com pre - (
! hensive survey made of rural condi- !
' tions by a conference composed of rep
resentatives of the faimei'B and of the
agricultural agencies responsible for
, leadership. j
I would call your attention to the
.widespread condition of political rent
lessness of our body politic. The causes
I of unrest while various and compli
I cated, are superficial rather than deep
seated. Broadly they arise, from or
are connected with, the failure on the
part of our government to arrive speed
ilv at a Just and permanent peace per
mitting return to normal conditions,
from the transfusion of radical theories
from seething European centers pend
ing such delay, from heartloas profiteer
ing resulting in the increase in the
cost of living and lastly from the
machinations of passionate and malev
olent agitators.
UNRE8T WILL DISAPPEAR.
With the return to normal condi
tions this unrest will rapidly disap
pear. in the meantime It does much
evil. It seems to me that in dealing
with this situation congress should
not he impatient or drastic hut should
seek rather to remove the causes. It
should endeavor to brlijg our country
back speedily to a peace, basis, with
ameliorated living conditions under the
minimum of restrictions upon personal
liberty that is consistent with our re
construction problems. And it should
arm the federal government with power
to deal in its criminal courts with those
persons who by violent methods would
abrogate our lime-tested Institutions.
With the free epression, of opinion and
with the advocacy of orderly political
exchange, however fundamental, there
must be no Interference, but towards
passion and malevolence tending to
incite crime and insurrection under
political evolution there
should be leniency-. Legislation to tills
joua has been recommended by the at
up Mte|w|ve maclllnery for the
t
torney general and should be enacted
In this direct connection I would call
your attention to my recommendations
on Aug. 8, pointing out legislative
measures which would bo effective in
controlling: and bringing down the pres
ent cost of living, Whidh contributes
so largely to this unrest. On only one
of these recommendations has the
congress acted. If the government's
campaign is to be effective, it Is neces
sary that the other cteps suggested
should be acted on at once."
1 renew and strongly urge the ne
cessity of the extension of tho present
food control act as to the period of
time in which it shall remain in oper
ation. The attorney general has sub
mitted a bill providing for an ex
tension of this act for a period of six
months. As it now stands it is limited
in operation to the period of the war
aril becomes inoperative upon tho for
]mal proclamation of peace. It is im
pfrative that it should be amended at
once. The department of justice has

REGULATE COLD STORAGE I
W a. «
government must be clearly brought
to the attention of the consuming pub
lic, civic, organizations and state of
ficials who are in a position to lend
Iheir assistance to our efforts. You
have made available funds with which
to carry on this campaign but there is
no provision in the law authorizing
their expenditure for the purpose of
making the public fully informed about
the efforts of the government. Speci
fic recommendation has been made by
lho attorney general in this regard
\ I
would strongly urge upon you its im- !
mediate adoption as it constitutes one j
of tho preliminary steps to this cam
paign. I also renew my recommenda
tion that the congress pass a law reg
ulating the cold storage as it is regu
loted, for example, by the laws of the
state of New Jersey,'which limits the !
t;me during which goods may he kept
in storage, prescribe the method of
disposing of them if kept beyond the
permitted period and require that 1
goods released from storage shall in all
cases bear the date of their
goods released from storage shall in all
cases bear the date of their receipt,
would materially add to the service
ability- of the law for the purpose we
t ow have in view if it were also pre
S'Tibrd that all goods released from
storage for interstate shipment should
have plainly marked upon each pack- .
age the selling or market price at j
which they went Into slorage. By this j
means the purchaser would always bo
able to learn what profits stood be- |
"" * 1 '"
n hint and the producer or the
wholesale dealer.
i would also renew my recommenda
tion that all goods destined for inter
state commerce should in. every case
where the form of package makes it
possible to mark with the price at
which they irrt the hands of the pro.
duccr.
LOWER COST OF LIVING
AVo should formulate a law requir
ing a federal license of all corpora
tions engaged in interstate commerce
and embodying in the license or in the
condition upon xvhieh it is to be Issued,
specific regulations designed to secure
competitive selling and prevent uncon
scionable profits in the methods of
marketing. Huch a law would afford
a welcome opportunity to effect other
much needed reforms in the business
of Interstate shipment and in the meth
ods of corporat.ons which are engaged
in it. but for the moment 1 confine my
recommendations to tho object im'
mediatcly in hand, which is to lower
the cost of living.
No one who has observed the march
of events in tlie last vear can fall to'

The real antidote for tho unrest which
"'' '«""J
manifests itself is not suppression, but
a deep consideration of the wrongs
thRt beset our national life and the
application of a remedy.
DEMOCRATIC INDUSTRY.
Congress has already shown Its
willingness to deal with these indus
trial wrongs by establishing the 8
hour day as the standard in every field
of labor. It has sought to find a way
to prevent child labor. It has served
the whole country by leading the way
in developing the means of preserving
and safeguarding lives and health in
dangerous industries. It must now
help in the difficult task of finding a
method that will bring about a genu
ine democratization of industry, based
upon the full recognition of the right
of those who work, in whatever rank,
to participate in some organic way in
every decision which directly affects
their welfare. It is with this purpose
In mind that I called a conference to
meet in Washington on December 1, to
consider these problems in nil their
broad aspects, with the idea of bring
ing about a better understanding be
tween these two interests.
The great unrest throughout the
world, out of which has emerged de
mand for an immediate consideration
ob the difficulties between capital and
labor bid us put our own house in or
der. I-Tankly there can be no perma
nent and lasting settlements between
capital and labor which do not recog
nize the fundamental concept for
which labor lifts been
struggling I
years. The whole world
gave its recognition and indorsement !
to these fundamental purposes in the
league of nations. The statesmen !
gathered at Versailles recognized the I
fact that world stability could not be
had by reverting to industrial stan
dards and conditions against which
the average workman of the world had
revolted. It is therefore the task of
statesmen or this new day of change
and readjustment to recognize world i
conditions and to bring about, through
legislation, conditions that will mean
only In greatpr contentment among the
also bring
mass of workmen, but
about a greater production and a
greater prosperity.
DEMANDS ADEQUATE WAGE.
To analyze the particulars in the
demands of labor is to admit the jus
tice of their complaint in many mat
ters that lie at their basis. The work
man demands an adequate wage, suf
ficient to permit him to live in corn
fort, unhampered by the fear of pover
and want in his old age. He de
mands the right to live and the rigli
to work amidst sanitary surroundings
both in home and in workshop, sur
roundings that develop and do not re
tard his own health and well being;
! and the right to provide for ills chil
! dren's wants in tho matter ( f health
I and education. In other words it is his
I desire to make the conditions of his
1 life and the lives of those dear to him
tolerable and easy to bear.
The establishment of the principles
regarding labor laid down in the
covenant of the league *of nations of
fers us the way to industrial peace
and conciliation. No other road lies
open to us. Not to pursue this one is
. i„ n ge r to invite enmities, bitterness
j Hnd antagonisms which in the end only
j lead t0 industrial and social disaster.
