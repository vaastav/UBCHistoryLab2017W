HIS ANNUAL MESSAGE
President Sends to Congress Views
on National Questions.
Brief But Comprehensive Summary
of the Document Onr Foreign
Relations and Matters of Do
mestic Policy Dealt With.
Washington, Dec. 3.—The following
Is given as a brief review of President
McKinley's annual message to the two
houses of congress:
The Chinese Crisis.
The president gives first place In his
message to the troubles In China, and
our connection with the allied forces op
erating there. He reviews the causes
leading up to the Boxer outbreak, and
the first murders of foreigners in Chi
nese territories. In this connection he
says:
The increasing gravity of the conditions
in China and the Imminence of peril to our
own diversified Interests In the empire, as
wou as to those of all the other treaty gov
ernments, were soon appreciated by this
government, causing it profound solicitude.
The United States from the earliest days
of foreign intercourse with China had fol
lowed a policy of peace, omitting no occa
sions to testify good will, to further the
extension of lawful trade, to respect the
sovereignty of Its government, and to In
sure by all legitimate and kindly but earn
est means the fullest measure of protec
tion for the lives and property of our law
abiding citizens and for the exercise of
their beneficent callings among the Chinese
people.
Mindful of this, It was felt to be appro
priate that our purposes should be pro
nounced In favor of such course as would
hasten united action of the powers at Pe
king to promote the administrative reforms
so greatly needed for strengthening the
Imperial government and maintaining the
Integrity of China, in which we believed the
whole western world to be alike concerned.
To these ends I caused to be addressed to
the several powers occupying territory and
maintaining spheres of Influence In China
the circular proposals, of 1899, Inviting
from them declarations of their intentions
and views as to the desirability of the
adoption of measures insuring the benefits
of equality of treatment of -all foreign
trade throughout China.
The history of the efforts made at re
lieving the beleaguered legatloners in Pe
king is thoroughly covered.
During the siege, says the president, the
defenders lost 65 killed, 135 wounded and
seven by disease—the last all children.
Continuing lie says: Not only are the pro
testations of the Chinese government that
it protected and succored the legations
positively contradicted, but irresistible
proof accumulates that the attacks upon
them were made by imperial troops, regu
larly uniformed, armed and officered, be
longing to the command of June Lu, the
Imperial commander In chief. Decrees en
couraging the Boxers, organizing them un
der prominent imperial officers, provision
ing them, and even granting them large
sums In the name of the empress dowager,
are known to exist. Members of the
tsung-ll-yamen who counseled protection
of the foreigners were beheaded. Even In
the distant provinces men suspected of for
eign sympathy were put to death, promi
nent among these being Chang Yen-Hoon,
formerly Chinese minister In Washington.
Onr Chinese Policy.
He recalls the circular note to the pow
ers Issued by this government on July 3,
outlining our policy as one of peace,
guaranteeing the Integrity of China, and
says:
As was then said, "the policy of the
government of the United States is to
seek a solution which may bring about
permanent safety and peace to China,
preserve Chinese territorial and admin
istrative entity, protect all rights guar
anteed to fr'.endly powers by treaty and
International law, and safeguard for the
world the p-lnciple of equal and Impar
tial trade with all parts of the Chinese
empire."
Conditions of Peace.
A little further on the president says:
I regard as one of the essential factors of
a durable adjustment the securement of
adequate guarantees for liberty of faith,
since insecurity of those natives who may
embrace alien creeds is a scarcely less ef
fectual assault upon the rights of foreign
worship and teaching than would be the
direct Invasion thereof.
The matter of indemnity for our wronged
citizens is a question of grave concern.
Measured In money alone, a sufficient
reparation may prove to be beyond the
ability of China to meet. All the powers
concur In emphatic disclaimers of any pur
pose of aggrandizement through the dis
memberment of the empire. I am disposed
to think that due compensation may be
made in part by increased guarantees of
security for foreign rights and immuni
ties, and, most important of all, by the
opening of China to the equal commerce of
all the world, yhese views have been and
will be earnestly advocated by our repre
sentatives.
First Place at Paris.
Our relations with other countries are
gone Into in detail. The Paris exposi
tion Is referred to as offering an opportu
nity for a display of the good1 will ex
isting between this country and France.
A criterion of the extent and success
of our participation in this exposition and
of the thoroughness with which our ex
hibits were organized is seen in the awards
granted to American exhibitors by the in
ternational Jury, namely, grand prizes,
240 gold medals, 597 silver medals, 776
bronze medals, 541, and honorable mentions,
322—2,476 in all, being the greatest total
number given to the exhibition of any
one exhibiting nation, as well as the largest
number in each grade.
This the president notes as especially
valuable, since It sets us to the front in
international questions of supply and de
mand.
Relations with Germany.
Of our relations with Germany the pres
ident says good will prevails. Of the meat
Inspection law of Germany he says:
An imperial meat Inspection law has
been enacted for Germany. While It may
simplify the inspection, it prohibits cer
tain products heretofore admitted. There
Is still great uncertainty as to whether
our well-nleh extlneuished German trade
in meat products can revive under its
new burdens. Much will depend upon
regulations not yet promulgated, which
we confidently hope will be free from
the discriminations which attended the
enforcement of the old statutes.
The Alaskan fionndury.
In connection with our relations with
England he refers to the partial settle
ment of the Alaskan boundary dispute
and urges such action as shall defi
nitely settle this vexing question. He
says that a convention has been before the
senate for some two years, but as no ac
tion has been taken I contemplate nego
tiating a new convention for a Joint de
termination of the meridian by telegraphic
observations. These, it Is believed, will
give more accurate and unquestionable re
sults than the sidereal methods heretofore
independently followed, which, as Is known
proved discrepant at several points on the
line, although not .varying at any place
more than 700 feet.
The War In Sonth Africa.
revl™
"f the incidents connected
with our shipping to South African
points, is given, and he says that in
this connection vexatious questions arose
through Great Britain's action in respect
to neutral cargoes, not contraband In
their own nature, shipped to Portuguese
South Africa, on the score of probable or
suspected ultimate destination to the Boer
states. Appropriate representations on
our part resulted in the British govern
ment agreeing to purchase outright all such
goods shown to be actual property of Amer
ican citizens, thus closing the incident to
the satisfaction of the immediately inter
ested parties, although, unfortunately
without abroad settlement of the question
of a neutral's right to send goods not
contraband per se to a neutral port ad
jacent to a belligerent area.
Relations vrith Italy.
The lynching of the Italians in Louisi
ana is the one question standing between
this government and Italy. That coun
try is still waiting for the punishment of
the parties guilty of that crime. Successive
grand juries have failed to find indictments.
The president recommends that congress
appropriately confer upon the federal
courts jurisdiction in this class of interna
tional cases where the ultimate responsi
bility of the federal government may be
involved.
Lynclkinff.
In my inaugural address I referred to
the general subject of lynching .in these
words:
"Lynching must not be tolerated in a
great and civilized country like the
United States courts, not mobs, must
execute the penalties of the law. The
preservation of public order, the right of
discussion, the integrity of courts, and
the orderly administration of justice
must continue forever the rock of safety
upon which our government securely
rests."
This I most urgently reiterate, and
again invite the attention of my coun
trymen to this reproach upon our civiliza
tion.
The Nlcarangaan Canal.
He advocates the speedy building of
the Nicaraguan canal, and recommends
the ratification of the Hay-Pauncefote
treaty.
New Treaty-with Spain,
Of our relations with Spain he sayf a
new -convention of extradition is ap
proaching comoletion and trusts that a
commercial convention may follow. Of
Spain's claim to a number of the is
lands in the Philippine group not covered
by the Paris treaty he says:
By the terms of the treaty of peace
the line bounding the ceded Philippine
group in the southwest failed to include
several small islands lying west of the
Sulus, which have always .been recog
nized as under Soanlsh control. The oc
cupation of Sibutu and Cagayan Sulu by
our naval forces elicited a claim on the
part of Spain, the essential equity of
which could not be gainsaid. In order to
cure the defect of the treaty by remov
ing all possible ground, of future mis
understanding respecting the interpreta
tion of its third article, I directed the
negotiation of a supplementary treaty,
which will be forthwith l&td before the
senate, wherehy Spain quits all title and
claim to the Islands named, as well as to
any and all islands belonging to the Phil
ippine archipelago lying outside the
lines ascribed in said third article, and
agrees that all such islands shall be com
prehended in the cession of the archi
pelago as fully as if they had been ex
pressly included within those lines. In
consideration of this cession the United
States is to pay to Spain the sum of
ftOOfOQO.
Our "Claims Agralnst Turkey.
Our claims upon the government of the
sultan for reparation for injuries suffered
by American citizens in Armenia and else
where give promise of early and satisfac
tory settlement. His majesty's good dispo
sition lin this regard has been evidenced by
the issuance of an irade for rebuilding the
American college at Harpoot.
Would Extend Reciprocity,
He urges the approval of the commer
cial conventions entered into between
this government and other powers as
soon as possible that the agricultural and
other industries of the country may profit
thereby. Continuing on this subject he
says:
The policy of reciprocity so manifestly
rests upon the principles of International
equity and has been so repeatedly ap
proved by the people of the united States,
that there ought to be no hesitation in
either branch of the congress in giving
to it full effect.
Exposition at Buffalo.
The exposition of the resources and
products of the western hemisphere to be
held at Buffalo next year promises impor
tant results not only for the United States
but for the other participating countries.
It is gratifying that the Latin-American
states have evinced the liveliest Interest,
and the fact that an international Ameri
can congress will be held in the City of
Mexico while the exposition is in progress
encourages the hope of a larger display at
Buffalo than might otherwise be practic
able. The work of preparing an exhibit of
our national resources is making satisfac
tory progress under the direction of dif
ferent officials of the federal government,
and the various states of the union have
shown a disposition toward the most lib
eral participation in the enterprise.
Our Financial Showing:.
The president points with much pride
to the showing made by the treasury de
partment and quotes exhaustively from
the report of Secretary Gage. He shows
the surplus for the year to be $79,527,060.18,
and estimates the surplus of the coming year
at$80,000,000. He says the present condition
of the treasury is one of undoubted strength.
The available cash balance November 30
was $139,303,794.50. Under "the form of
statement prior to the financial law of
March 14 last this would have been in
cluded in the statement of available cash
gold coin and bullion held for the redemp
tion of United States notes.
Further Financial Legislation.
He recommends further financial legis
lation in the following words:
It will be the duty as I am sure it will
be the disposition of the congress to pro
vide whatever further legislation is need
ed to insure the continued parity under
all conditions between our two forms of
metallic money, silver and gold.
Our surplus revenues have permitted the
secretary of the treasury since the close
of the fiscal year to call in the funded loan
of 1891 continued at two per cent, in the
sum of $25,364,500. To and including No
vember 30, $23,458,100 of these bonds have
been paid. This sum, together with the
amount which may accrue from further
redemptions under the call, will be ap
plied to the sinking fund.
The law of March 14, 1900, provided for
refunding into two per cent. 30-year bonds,
payable, principal and interest, in gold
coin of the present standard value, that
portion of the public debt represented by
the three-per-cent. bonds of 1908, the four
per*cents of 3907 and the flve-per-cents
of 1900, of which there was outstand
ine at the date of said law $S39,149,
930. The holders of the old bonds presented
them for exchange March 14 and Novem
ber 30 to the amount of $364,943,750. The
net saving to the government on these
transactions aggregates $9,106,166.
Banklns Facilities Extended.
.^S^Lkeneficial effect of the financial .act
of 1900, so far as it relates to the modifi
cation of the national banking act, is al
ready apparent. The provision for the
Incorporation of national banks with a
capital of not less than $25,000 in places
hot exceeding 3,000 inhabitants has result
ed in the extension of banking facilities
to many small communities hitherto un
le to provide themselves with banking
institutions under the national system.
There were organized from the enact
ment of the law up to and including
November 30, 369 national banks, of which
266 were with capital less than $50,000 and
103 with capital of $50,000 or more.
It is worthy of mention that the greater
number of banks being organized under
the new law are in sections where the
need of banking facilities has been most
pronounced. Iowa stands first, with 30
banks of the smaller class, while Texas,
Oklahoma, Indian territory and the mid
dle and western sections of the country
have also availed themselves largely of
the privileges under the new law.
Our Foreign Trade.
Our foreign trade shows a remarkable
record of commercial and industrial prog
ress. The total of imports and exports
for the first time in the history of the
country exceeds $2,000,000,000. The exports
are greater than they have ever been
before, the total for the fiscal year 1900
being $1,394,483,082, an increase over 1899
of $167,459,780, an increase over 1898 of $163,
000,752, over 1897 of $343,489,526, and greater
than 1896 by $511,876,144.
The growth of manufactures in the
United States is evidenced by the fact
that exports of manufactured products
largely exceed those of any previous year,
their value for 1900 being $433,851,756,
against $339,592,146 In 1899, an increase of
28 per cent.
Agricultural products were also export
ed during 1900 in greater volume than in
1899, the total for the year being $835,858,
123. against $784,776,142 in 1899.
The imports for the year amounted to
$849,941,184, an increase over 1899 of $152,
792,695. This increase is largely in mate
rials for manufacture, and is in response
to the rapid development of manufactur
ing in the United States.
Tho Internal Revenne Tax.
I recommend that the congress at its
present session reduce the internal rev
enue taxes imposed to meet the expenses
of the war with Spain in the sum of $3^
000,000. This reduction should be secured
by the remission of those taxes which ex
perience has shown to be the most bur
densome to the industries of the people.
I specially urge that there be included In
whatever reduction is made the legacy tax,
bequests for public uses of a literary, edu
cational or charitable character.
Recommends Ship Subsidy.
American vessels during the past three
years have carried about nine per cent,
of our exports and imports. Foreign ships
should carry the least, not the greatest,
part of American trade. The remarkable
growth of our steel Industries, the prog
ress of shipbuilding for the domestic trade
and our steadily maintained expenditures
for the navy have created an opportuni
ty to place the United States in the first
rank of commercial maritime powers.
The Trust Question.
The trust question receives the atten
tion of the president, and he says:
"It is apparent that uniformity of legis
lation upon this subject in the several
states is much to be desired. It is to be
hoped that such uniformity, founded in a
wise and just discrimination between what
is injurious and what is useful and neces
sary in business operations, may be ob
tained, and that means may be found for
the congress, within the limitations of its
constitutional power, so to supplement an
effective code of state legislation as to
make a complete system of laws through
out the United States adequate to compel
a general observance of the salutarv rules
to which I have referred."
The Philippines.
Considerable attention is given the sub
ject of the Philippines, and in this con
nection the scope and work of the Phil
ippine commission as outlined to the com
missioners is fully outlined for the bene
fit of congress. Of the present condi
tions in the islands the president says:
In my Jast annual message I dweit at
some length upon the condition of af
fairs in the Philippines. While seeking
to impress upon you that the grave re
sponsibility of the future government of
those Islands rests with the congress of
the United States, I abstained from rec
ommending at that time a specific and
final form of government for the terri
tory actually held by the United States
forces and in which, as long as insur
rection continues, the military arm must
necessarily be supren. I stated my pur
pose, until the congress shall have made
known the formal expression of Its wili,
to use the authority vested In me by the
constitution and the statutes to uphojd
the sovereignty of the United States in
those distant islands as in all other pianos
where our fl«g rightfully floats, placJr.ff.
to tha) ond, the disposal of the army
and navy all the means which the lib
erality of the congress and the people
have provided. No contrary expression
of the will of the congress having been
made, I have steadfastly pursued the pur
pose so declared* employing the civil arm
as well toward the accomplishment of
pacification and the institution of local
governments within the lines of author
ity and law*
We Are Ualclngr Progrress,
Progress in the hoped-fot direction haa
been favorable. Our forces have suc
cessfully controlled the greater part of
the islands, overcoming' the organized
forces of the insurgents and carrying
order and administrative regularity to all
quarters. What opposition remains is for
the most part scattered, obeying no con
certed plan of strategic action* operating
only by the methods common to the tra
ditions of guerrilla warfare, which, while
Ineffective to alter the general control
now established, are still sufficient to
beget Insecurity among the population^
that have felt the good results of our
control, and thus delay the conferment
upon them of the fullest measures of
local self-government, of education, and
of industrial and agricultural develop
ment which we stand ready to give to
them.
By the spring of this year the effective
opposition of the dissatisfied Tagals to
the authority of the United States was
virtually ended, thus opening the door
for the extension of a stable adminis
tration over m.uch of the territory of
the archipelago. Desiring to bring this
about, I appointed in March last a civil
commission composed of Hon. William
H. Taft. of Ohio Prof. Dean C. Worcester,
of Michigan Hon. Luke E. Wright, of Ten
nessee: Hon. Henry C. Ide, of Vermont,
and Prof. Bernard Moses, of California.
The aims of their mission and the scope
of their authority are clearly set forth
in my instructions of April 7. 1900, ad
dressed to the secretary of war to be
transmitted to them.
Principles Are Appreciated.
Referring to the manner In which the
work of the commission upon the lines
laid down in his instructions to them
has been received by. the people of the
Philippines, the president says:
It Is evident that the most enlightened
thought of the Philippine islands fully ap
preciates the importance of these princi
ples and rules, and they will inevitably
within a short time command universal
assent. Upon every division and branch
of the government of the Philippines,
therefore, must be imposed three inviol
able rules:
That no person shall be deprived of life,
liberty, or property without due process or
law that private property shall not be
taken for public use without just com
pensation that in all criminal prosecutions
the accused shall enjoy the right to a
speedy and public trial, to be informed
of the nature and cause of the accusation,
to be confronted with the witnesses against
him, to have compulsory process for ob
taining witnesses in his favor, and to have
the assistance of counsel for his defense
that excessive bail shall not be required,
nor excessive fines imposed, nor cruel and
unusual punishment inflicted that no per
son shall be put twice in jeopardy for the
same offense, or be compelled in any crim
inal case to be a witness against himself
that the right to be secure against unrea
sonable searches and seizures shall not be
violated that neither slavery nor involun
tary servitude shall exist except as a pun
ishment for crime that no bill of attain
der or ex post facto law shall be passed
that no law shall be passed abridging the
freedom of speech or of the press, or the
rights of the people to peaceably assemble
and petition the government for a redress
of grievances that no law shall bo mado
respecting an establishment of religion or
prohibiting the free exercise thereof, and
that the free exercise and enjoyment of
religious profession and worship without
discrimination or preference shall forever
be allowed.
Porto Rico.
The civil government of Porto Rico pro
vided for by the act of the congress, ap
proved April 12, 1900, is In successful op
eration. The courts have been estab
lished. The governor and his associates,
working intelligently and harmoniously,
are meeting with commendable success.
Dealing* with Cuba.
The present conditions In Cuba are re
ferred to, citing the call for the election
of delegates to a constitutional conven
tion and the meeting of the convention
which is now In session, and closes this
part of his message with the following:
When the convention concludes its la
bor I will transmit to the congress the
constitution as framed by the conven
tion for Its consideration and for such
action as it .may deem advisable.
The Army.
An Increase in the regular army is
recommended, and the need of sold!er.s
shown. After saying that we need at
least 26,000 troops at home to care for
our expensive fortifications and ordnance,
he continues:
We have in Cuba between 5,000 and 6.00C
troops. For the present our troops in that
Island cannot be withdrawn or materially
diminished, and certainly not until the con
clusion of the labors of the constitutional
convention now in session and a govern
ment provided by the new constitution
shall have been established and Its stability
assured.
In Porto Rico we have reduced the gar
risons to 1,636, which Include 896 native
troops. There is no room for further re
duction here. We will be required to
keep a considerable force in the*Philip
pine Islands for some time to come. From
the best information obtainable we shall
need there for the immediate future from
50,000 to 00,000 men. I am sure the num
ber may be reduced as the insurgents
shall come to acknowledge the author
ity of the United States, of which there
are assuring indications.
It may be apparent that we will re
quire an army of about 60,000, and that
during present conditions in Cuba and
the Philippines the president should have
authority to increase the force to the
present number of 100,000. Included in
this number authority should be given to
raise native troops in the Philippines,up
to 15,000. which the Taft commission be
lieve will -be more effective in detecting
and suppressing guerrillas, assassins and
Ladrones than our own soldiers.
The Postal Service.
Under a discussion of the postal serv
ice he urges an extension of the rural
free delivery system and says:
This service ameliorates the isolation of
farm life, conduces to good roads, and
quickens and extends the dissemination of
general information. Experience thus far
has tended to allay the apprehension that
it would be so expensive as to forbid its
general adoption or make it a serious bur
den. Its actual application has shown that
it increases postal receipts, and can be ac
companied by reductions in other branches
of the service, so that the augmented rev
enues and the accomplished savings to
gether materially reduce the net cost. The
evidences which point to these conclusions
are presented in detail In the annual re
port of the postmaster general which with
its recommendations is recommended to
the consideration of the congress. The full
development of this special service, how
ever, requires such a large outlay of money
that it should be undertaken only after a
careful stu3y and thorough understanding
of all that it involves.
The Wavy.
The recommendations of the secretary
of the navy for more ships and an in
crease in the personnel of the navy are
approved, as well as those of the estab
lishment of a national naval reserve and
suitable recognition for all officers who
rendered distinguished service during the
war with Spain.
Agriculture.
The department of agriculture has been
extending its work during the past year,
reaching farther for new varieties of
seeds and plants cooperating more fully
with the states and territories in re
search along useful lines making prog
ress in meteorological work relating to
lines of wirsless telegraphy and forecasts
for ocean-going vessels continuing in
quiry as to animal disease looking into
the extent and character of food adul
teration outlining plans for the care,
preservation and intelligent harvesting of
our woodlands studying soils that pro
ducers may cultivate with better knowl
edge of conditions, and heloing to clothe
desert places with grasses suitable to
our arid regions. Our island possessions
are being considered that their peoples
may bo helped to produce thp tropical
products now so extensively brought into
the United States. Inquiry into methods
of improving our roads has been active
during the year help has been given to
marly localities, and scientific investiga
tion of material in the states and ter
ritories has been inaugurated. Irrigation
problems in our semi-arid regions are
receiving careful and increased consider*
ation.
Washington Celebration.
The transfer of the government to this
city is a fact of great historical interest.
Among the people there is a feeling of
genuine pride in the capital of the re
public.
The congress having provided for "an
appropriate national celebration of tho
centennial anniversary of the establish
ment of the seat of government in tho
District of Columbia," the committees
authorized by it have prepared a pro
gramme for the 32th of December, 1900,
which date has been selected as the an
niversary day.
Conclusion,
In our great prosperity we must guard
against the danger it invites of an ex
travagance J:i government expenditures
and appropriations and the chosen rep
resentatives of the people will, I doubt
not, furnish an example in their legisla
tion of that wise economy which In a sea
son of plenty husbands for the future.
Let us keep always in mind that tho
foundation oi' our government is liberty
its superstructure, peace.

only one way to cure deafness, and that is
by constitutional remedies. Deafness is
caused by an inflamed condition of the mu

this tube gets inflamed you have a rumbling
sound or imperfect hearing, and when it is
entirely closed deafness is the result, and
unless the inflammation can be taken out
and this tube, restored to its normal con

OLDEST MANJN AMERICA
Tells How He Escaped the
Terrors of Many Winters
by Using Peruna.
Mr. Isaac Brook, the Oldest Man In tho
United States.
Mr. Isaac Brock, of McLennan county,
Tex., has attained the great age of 111 years,
having been born in 1788. He is an ardent
friend to Peruna and speaks of it in the
following terms:
"During my long life I have known a
great many remedies for coughs, colds, ca
tarrh and diarrhoea. I had always supposed
these affections to be different diseases, but
I have learned from Dr. Hartman's books
that these affections are the same and are
properly called catarrh.
"As for Dr. Hartman's remedy, Peruna,
I have found it to be the best, if not the
only reliable remedy for these affections.
"Peruna ham been my stand-by for
many yean, and attrlbuto my good
health and my extreme age to thla
remedy. It exactly meeta all my
requirements•
"I have come to rely upon it almost en
tirely for the many little things for which I
need medicine. I believe it to be especially
valuable to old people." Issac Brock.
Catarrh is the greatest enemy of old age.
A person entirely free from catarrh is sure
to live to a hale and hearty old age. A free

Allen's Ulcerlne 8alve cures Cbroale
The ordinary every-dav life of most of our women is a
ceaseless treadmill of work.
How much harder the daily tasks become when some
derangement of the female organs makes every
painful and keeps the nervous system all unstrung.
One day she is wretched and utterly miserable 5 in a day
or two she is better and laughs at her fears, thinking there
is nothing much the matter after all but before night the
deadly backache reappears, the limbs tremble, the lips twitch
—it seems as though all the imps of Satan were clutching
her vitals she goes to pieces ana is flat on her back.
No woman ought to arrive at this terrible state of
misery, because these symptoms are a sure forerunner of
womb troubles. She must remember that Lydia E. Pink
ham's Vegetable Compound is almost an infallible cure
for all female ills, such as irregularity of periods, which cause
weak stomach, sick headache, etc., displacements and in
flammation of the Womb, or any of the multitudes of ill
nesses which beset the female organism.
Mrs. Gooden wrote to Mrs. Plnkham when she
was In great trouble* Her letter teHs tho resultm
Deab Mes.Pinkhaji:—I
and the interest you have taken in me, and truly believe that your medicines
and advice are worth more to a woman than all the
doctors in the world. My troubles began with inflam
mation and hemorrhages from the kidneys, then
inflammation, congestion and falling of the womb,
and inflammation of the ovaries. I underwent local
treatment every dav for some time then, after nearly
two months, the doctor gave me permission to go
back to work. I went back, but in less than a week
was compelled to give up and go to bed. On break
ing down the second time, I decided to let doctors
ana medicines alone and try your remedies. Before
the first bottle was gone I felt the effects of it.
