WROTE LEITEB SATING, 1
WILL GETJIEI Hir
Crass Examination of Witnesses Will
be Long as Hains' Attorneys Say
They Are Annis' Friends and Hare
Rehearsed the Storj.
Flushing, N. Y„ Dec. IT.—Counsel
for Thornton J. Haina declared today
that the state's witnesses called to
prove the ease that the author was a
principal with his brother, Captain
Jeter 0. Hains, Jr., in the killing of
William E. Annis as he sat in his boat
at the Bay Side Yacht club laat sum*
mer, will be subjected to long and ex
haustive, examinations. The H»in«
lawyers assert that the prosecuting
witnesses were all close friends of
Annis and that there is little doubt
they have rehearsed the tragedy with
a design of presenting an unvarying
story.
New light on the case was shed this
morning when Hains' counsel admit
ted that Thornton J. Hains had had
some trouble with William Annis over
the publication of a magazine article
last June. It is said that the author
submitted the manuscript to Ripley,
the owner of the magazine upon which
Annis waa employed, and that Annie
induced Ripley to return it. Counsil
for Hains state that the defendant
then wrote a letter to Ripley saying
he knew why the manuscript was re
jected and cftncluded with the words,
"I will get even with him yet."
The Story.
Tracing the movements of the prin
cipals in the Bayside Yacht club trag
edy with the aid of miniature iron
figures and models of the float -and
the catboat Pam, Edwin Andrews, a
yacht club member, showed under ex
amination how the.ctrmy captain stand
ing on the float's edge held alioft the
obscuring booftr-and -sail of Annis
boat and shot the publisher as he sat
at tte'UUer:
There was surprise today when It
was learned 'that John Tonnlnk, a
Swedish boatman, who saw the trag
edy, could not be located.
District Attorney Darrln said he
thought Tonning was in Sweden, but
that nothing had been heard from him
since laat September.
"He is a most Important witness for
us/' said Lawyer Mclntyre last night,
"for through him he would have
Shown that he struck Capt. Hains
after the shooting with a boat hook
•or oar and that to protect his brother,
Thornton Hains drew his revolver."
The cross examination of Andrews
consumed the major portion of the
'afternoon session and Lawyer Mcln
tyre sought to develop that Thornton
Hains bad used expressions after the
shooting to the effect that he had
tried to dissuade Capt Hains from his
act and that he would hold him until
the officers came.
Special Prosecutor White declared
.in the opening of.the state's case that
evidence would be brought out to show
that Thornton Hains had full knowl
edge of his brother's intention to kill
I Annis and virtually led the way'to the
yacht club and directed the search for
the publisher. Mr. White declared
that Thornton Hains pointed his re
volver at Mrs. Annis and prevented
her from going to the aid of her
wounded husband.
Mr. Mclntyre called the attention of
the witness to the models shown and
I Mr. Andrews Bald it waa a fair repre
isentation, but saying: "Your boat is
[larger than the dock, while the testl
mony shows the boat waa twenty feet
long and the dock was forty feet Now
I eyes convince better than what we
Ihear and I don't want any dispropor
tlon of the models."
Mr. Mclntyre said there was no in
tentlon to mislead by the models and
counsel said he would for the time
'turn the attention of the witness to
-the positions of the iron manikins.
Justice Crane said that he would
only permit the use of the model for
'general purposes as it was evident
that it was clearly out of proportion.
Then slowly the witness traced the
movements of the principals and the
jiron manikins were moved on the
{models to show the different positions
taken. A juror asked the court at this
point if the models were built to scale.
1
"I understand they are not," said
Justice Crane.
"They are not built to scale,' said
'Mr. Mclntyre, "but are a correct rep
resentation."
"I shall instruct the. jury that the
models are not for purposes ofpropor
itlon and only to show general move
ments," said the court.
"What position was Captain Hains
'In at the time of the shooting?",
"He was standing at the edge of the
'float'with his left hand on the boom
of Annis' boat and firing under the
,«all." ."i
Andrews said he and Roberts took
from the water. He said he
did not notice Roberts nor did he see
Thornton Hains point a revolver at
Roberts. The witness did not nee Mrs.
on the float when the shooting
took place.
The cross examination of Andrews
closed, the district attorney took up.
Up rebuttal. The prosecutor pressed
tv^Jf
several questions upon the witness to
determine the-lapse of time between
the first and last shots fired.
Counsel-tor the defense Interrupted
and protested that if it was the theory
of the state that the brothers had
entered into a conspiracy to commit a
crime .it was not permissible to adduce
testimony concerning Captain Hatha
and the defendant after the shooting.
The court overruled the motion. The
rebuttal was ended- without further
questions of subsequent events. On
cross ^examination Mr. Andrews said:
"Annis jumped from his boat to the
float and then stumbled into the
water."
"Did you know there was an unex
ploded cartridge in Capt Hains' re
volver after the ahootingt"
"No."
"Did you know only six cartridges
were discharged?"
"No."
"Now, you were not holding a stop
watch to time these shots?"
"No. I was trying to get at the man
who was doing the shooting," said
Andrews.
Dr. Walter Prey of Long Island city,
coroner's physician, described the
autopsy. He discovered twenty ex
ternal wounds and then In detail de
scribed what he had done in' tracing
the course of the bullets. Dr. Frey
was given a scorching cross examina
tion and then the prosecutor' called
Mrs William B. Annis to the stand.
She said:
Mrs. Annis Testifies,
"I am the wife of William B. Annis.
My name is Mien Annis. I was pres
ent at his death. Dr. Schmock was
there."
"Did you see your husband die?"
"Yes."
"That is all," said the district attor
ney.
Mr. Mclntyre said that the district
attorney should exhaust the witness
upon all her knowledge of the case.
Justice Crane said It was not neces
sary at this time. She was not cross
examined.

PATHETIC APPEAL
Mother Slept In Cold to Keep Baby
9
From Father.
Philadelphia, Dec. 17.—With her
4-year-old baby wrapped in a dingy
shawl and closely clasped in her
arms, Mrs. Ella Aehton of Fourth
and George streets, crept under a
pile of timber in a vacant lot near
her home late yesterday, and
throughout the long, cold night sang
quavering little nursery songs to
keep the baby quiet while she watch
ed and waited for this morning's
dawn.
When the first gray light appeare'd
with fingers numbed with the cold,
she built a little fire, and It was the
thin trail of smoke that betrayed her
whereabouts to Policeman Lyons of
the Fourth and Snyder avenue sta
tion. Lyons took mother and child
to the station bouse, where, with
tears running down her cheeks, and
mingling with those of the boy, who
clung desperately to her, she told her
pathetic little story.
Tells Sad Story.
"My husband has left me," she said,
sobbingly, "and 'because he wants to
take ray baby from me he has charg
ed me with drunkenness and neglect
SO the judge gave him an order to
gtt my boy, (but when I heard of this
I lied. I would rather die than be
without my baby, and as there was
no place for me to go, I took him out
on the Jot He wasn't cold. I wrap-'
ped him up warmly, and then built a
little shelter under the lumber for
us both. He—he thought it was a
lark, and made me sing all the Moth
er Goose songs that I knew to him.
Then I sang "Harrlgan," and lots' of
other things, until finally he went to
sleep."
Magistrate Hughes, although plain
ly affected by. the mother's story, had1'
no choice but to turn the boy over to
father, George Ashton, who resides
at Twelfth and Ritner streets, and he
was .at once sent for. When she
heard: that after all the boy was to
lie taken away from her, the mother
dropped on her knees In the dingy
police court and begged them to tor
ture her, or do anything, just so she
might be allowed to care for her
child. The boy clung closely to his
mother and sobbed bitterly yhen
given into his tether's charge. W
May let del Baby.
Thefather brought several wit
nesses With him, however, to the
magistrate's office to prove the wo
man unfit to care for her little son,
so. lkfagistrate Hughes has commit
ted her to the Houm of Correction
for six months, but says when she
comes out, if she can prove her abil
ity to look after the boy he will en
deavor to give her back her child.

NO PKROTECHIICS WHEN THE

President Indicated That Congress
Had Limited the Field in Which Se

Because Members Had Been Hit
Washington, Dec. 17.—Chairman
Perkins of the house special commit

of action relative to the suggestions
of the president in his annual message
concerning the secret service, to which
members of congress have taken ex.
ception, submitted the report of that
committee at the beginning of today's
session of the house. The report
recommends the adoption of the reso
lution calling upon the president to
supply the house with the evidence
upon which he based his statement
that members of the house were prin
clpally concerned over the fact that
the secret service men had been in
vestigating the members themselves.
The resolution was adopted without
a dlSBentlng vote and after very light
comment Cochrane of New York sug
gested that it should be made appli
cable to congress as a whole and not
merely to the house but the change
was not made.

TAFT'S NEW TRADE
Is Learning Cabinet Making With
Good Success
Washington, Dec. 17.—When Presi
dent-elect Taft left Washington for
New York, late last week he was
still undecided as to whom to ap
point to several of the most import
ant places in the cabinet. When he
came here from Hot Springs, early
in the week, he had not picked his
secretaries of state and treasury and
his attorney general, positions he
considers the real keystone ol the
arch.
During the week he has received
numerous suggestions in regard to
cabinet availabilities, and yesterday
afternoon conferred individually with
the President and with secretary Root
about, the qualifications of certain
men who have been recommended to
sit at his council table. Subsequent
ly, he frankly admitted that he was
unable to say whom he expected to
name for the three offices mentioned,
and while he no doubt wishes he had
already found the men, he still has
more than ten weeks to make his se
lections.
If Mr. Taft could pick his secretary
of state, hiB secretary of treasurer,
and his attorney general now, it
would be a comparatively easy mat
ter to construct his entire cabinet
without much further deliberation.
But, as has been explained, it is his
purpose to surround himself with
men of great ability, who. 'also pos
sess slieclal qualifications for these
particular positions.
Really Big Men Scarce
There is no dearth of men of med
iocrity, but Mr. Taft has discovered
that there is a distressing scarcity
of men of the intellectual standard he
deems essential. He has tho. names
of several in mind for secretary of
state, but has yet to indicate whether
any of them measures up to tho po
sition, and, if so, is willing to go into
the cabinet
As for the attorney generalship, he
also la proceeding deliberately, inas
much as the work of the department
of justice is ^increasing constantly,
and the importance of the office is
growing in proportion. The new at
torney general will have to be a man
of more than ordinary legal capaci
ty of a high order for. the question
o^ control of Interstate corporations
will receive constantly Increasing at
tention from the federal government
But as already stated, the president
elect's mind is open still with re-

GRAND FORKS, N. D., THURSDAY, DECEMBER 17,1908.
Minneapolis, Dee. 17.—There
was no change today in the con
dltion of -United States Senator
Hansbrough, who was operated
on in Asbury hospital here about
a week ago for mastoldlts.
spect to this office, as well as the
secretaryship of'the treasury.
Fonr Xen Chosen
Although Mr. Taft declines to ad
mit officially that he has made up his
mind In regard to any of these places
in the cabinet, it perhaps can be said
without fear of contradiction that he
has already dispose^ of at least four
of these positions.
Frank H. Hitchcock will become
postmaster general beyond all doubt
It having been known for a long time
that this was to be a reward for the
presidential nomination and during
the campaign.
James Wilson will be continued as
secretary of agriculture, to enable
him to break all records for service
in the cabinet After continuing for
another year or so he will retire In
favor of, very likely, Gilford Plnchot
now chief of the forestry department
James R. Garfield, unless there Is a
change in the present program, will
be retained as secretary of the Inter
ior. Likewise, Luke .13. Wright will
remain as secretary of war, although
it is believed he will not stay
throughout Mr. Toft's administration.
The general will be the representa
tive of the south, hailing as he does
from Tennessee, and his appointment
will, in a way, be a recognition of the
Bupport Mr. Taft received from Dem
ocrats during the campaign.
Resented by Republicans
Mr. Wright himself has been a Dem
ocrat all his life Is a stockholder in
one of the leading Democrat news
papers in his state,' and his son pre
sided at the last Democrat state con
vention, and supported Mr. Bryan.
Many of the republicans of Tennessee
do-not relish the idea of the general
being in the cabinet but Mr. Taft's
present intention is to keep him on
account of his thorough knowledge
of Philippine affairs and his general
legal and administrative ability. But
as suggested, the chanceB are that
the general will nOt remain more
than a year or two.)
In connection with the naval port
folio, the names t&at are conjured
with most are thosfe of Thomas H.
Newberry, ol Detroit, the present
secretary, anf.Col. Thompson, of New
York, the preside^.. q{ the naval
league, who was frequently in con
ference with Mr. Taft Ut Hot Springs
If the judge has made a choice for
this office be has as yet given no
sign of it. William Loeb, jr., secre
tary to Mr. Roosevelt, continues to be
mentioned prominently in connection
with the secretaryship of commerce
of labor, and, although the president
elect is understood to have him in
mind for a place in the cabinet, he
has as yet reached no conclusion.
Mr. Taft thinks well of Charles.
Nagel, one of the "prominent lawyers
of St. Louis and a member of the
Republican national committer of
that state, who was in charge of the
national headquarters at Chicago.
Nagel has been urged for a cabinet
position, and while he has done work
for some large corporate interests,
he is regarded as one of the possi
bilities for attorney general.
Confetence With lturton
There was widespread curiosity as
to what took place between the PreB
ldent-elect and Representative Theo
dore E. Burton, of Ohio, yesterday
afternoon. The later is one of the
close friends of Mr. Taft, and they
usually become confldental when they
get together. It is known they talked
about the legislative situation in the
house, particularly with reference to
tariff revision, but there was no need
of further consideration of the plan
to prevent the election of "Uncle Joe"
Cannon as speaker of the house—a
subject which received much atten
tion from them at Hot SpringB two or
three weeks ago. If the Ohio sena
torial situation was alluded to it was
done In a delicate manner, inasmuch
as Charles P. Taft, brother of the
President-elect, is Mr. Burton's lead
ing competitor in the race.
Moreover, it would be Incorrect to
assume that the question of Mr. Bur
ton's entering the cabinet either as
secretary of state or aB secretary of
the treasury furnished a topic of con
versation. If Mr. Taft intends to in
vite Mr Burton in abeyance pending
the determination of the contest for
Senator Foraker's seat. The judge
knows-Mr. Button is resolved to proB
ecute his canvass up to the time a
senator is chosen by the Buckeye leg
islature, and has no intention of with
drawing in fatir of his brother. Con
sequently, he would regard it as rath
er Indelicate to dangle before the
representative's eye a cabinet port
folio at this particular time. Mr.
Burton expects to go to Ohio next
week to give hiB close personal at
tention to his campaign, and will re
main there until the legislature be
gins its balloting. In this connection,
it may be of interest to say that
Harry M. Daugherty, another asplr
rant for the toga, arrived in Wash
ington today, and had a talk with Mr.
Burton tonight

Washington, Dec. 17.—The annual

Hawaii, made public today, declares
that while there has been in the past
a widespread feeling that the territory
has received little attention in return
for the $10,287,000 customs reeclpts
and $456,678 in internal revenue, it
has paid Into the federal treasury, that
feeling has been largely dispelled by
liberal appropriations by congress for

more than those of the entire United
States in 1790. A recommendation is
made for the amendment of the lnnd

POPULAR VOTES
{Flie Number Received by the Leading
Political Parties
New York, Dec. 17.—The total
popular vote of the various presi
dential candidates at the last nation
al election has. just been made
known today in an official form by
the filing of the last of the official
vote, that of Michigan.
The totals show the following
votes cast:
Taft, Republican, 7,G37,676.
Bryan, Democrat, 6,393,182.
Debs, Socialist. 447,651.
Chafin, Prohibition, 241,252.
Hisgen, Independent, 23,186.
Watson, Populist, 33,S71.
Gilhaus, Social-labor, 15,421.
Total for all candidates, 14,852,239.
This grand total exceeds by 1,34?.,
531, the total number of votes cast
In the presidential election of 1904,
when the grand total was 13,510,708.
Compared with that election, the
candidates of the Republican, Demo
cratic and Socialist party increased
their vote this year. The reverse is
true of the candidates of the Prohi
bition, Populist and Socialist-Labor
parties. The Independence party did
not figure In the presidential election
of four year's ago.
The biggest difference in a party
vote is shown in an increase for
Bryan of 1.315,211 over the total vote
cast in 1904 for Alton B. Parker, the
Democratic candidate. Tafe received
14,190 votes more than were polled
for President Roosevelt in 1904 and
Debs run 45,368 ahead of his pre
decessor on the Socialist ticket
The votes cast for Taft and Bryan
were almost identical In number in
two states, namely, Maryland and
Nevada. In the first mentioned, Taft
received 111,253, and Bryan 111,117
and in the other, 10,214 and 10,655
respectively.
