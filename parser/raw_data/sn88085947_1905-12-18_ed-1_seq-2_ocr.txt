Roosevelt and the Railroads.
Although President Roosevelt's message to congress was couched
In diplomatic language, nobody knew better than he, that he was not
engaging in a pillow fight.
Nobody knew better than he, that he was tackling the stubborn
host of special privilige in their last political stronghold, when ho went
up against the industrial and financial bosses in the United States sen
ate and in the name of the people demanded governmental regulation
of railroad rates to the end that rebates and other forms of graft might
be abolished.
If the senate were made up of honest representatives of the great
mass of the people there would be no fight at all, for then that body
would be responsible to the will of the people and would cooperate with
the lower house and enact legislation protecting the people in their
rights.
But it ls quite generally understood now that for years the great
combinations of wealth have been sneaking their subservient tools
into the senate, bringing about the election of nun who represented
class interests rather than all the people.
And when President Roosevelt, as the courageous champion ■ f
the rights of the people and a government of the people, by the peo
ple, by the people, and for the people, faces the United States senate
today he finds that body made up largely of men evidently hostile to
this popular demand and determined to continue running the govern
ment in the interest of the privileged few rather than for the benefit
of the whole people.
That's where you come in—you. the average man. It's your fight
President Roosevelt is your representative, your servant. He is making
this fight for you and your children and your children's children.
Have you never wondered how it came about that out of our Indus
trial, commercial, political, financial and social system there grew a
few multi-millionaires who reveled in luxury while their millions of
brothers found it mighty tough work to raise and educate families and
make botn ends meet?
And haven't your eyes been opened lately when you learned how
the McCurdy's, McCalls, Hydes and Alexanders grew rich handling the
savings of the workers, the horde laid aside to protect widows and
orphans from grim want?
Didn't it open your eyes when you learned how the Coxes, Dur
hams and Murphy's became millionaires while controlling the machinery
of municipal government as political bosses?
Can t you see that it was the men on the inside, the men in con
trol, who got rich out of politics and insurance?
Doesn't it begin to dawn on you that it is the men on the inside,
the men in control of our great transportation systems and their con
federates, the big shippers, who are getting the railroad graft and en
riching themselves at the expense of the people who work for a living
and have no pull?
Isn't it plain that Roosevelt is the most popular president since tho
days of Washington because he is trying to represent all of the people
and get a square deal for everybody?
That's the central idea in this fight for governmental regulation
of railroad rates —a square deal for everybody, a square deal for the big
shipper and a square deal for the little shipper, a square deal for the
Morgans and the Rockefellers and a square deal for YOU.
And every honest American citizen, without regard to creed, color
or politics, who believes in a square deal for all and special privileges
to none should get right back of President Roosevelt in this fight for
representative government and give his demand on the senate all tho
force of a demand of the whole people of this republic.
The Northwest Passage.
The dream of daring navigatore for more than three centuries has
been realized in the completion at last of the northwest passage.
Capt. Roand Amundsen has achieved the distinction of being the
first man in the history of the world to navigate the arctic region from
Davis strait to Bering strait and thus to assist the mastery of man
over long defiant nature.
It long since became certain that a northwest passage would be
useless for commercial purposes because it would be practically un
navigable. But explorations have continued for reasons of sentiment
and science.
I It is reported that Capt. Amundsen has positively located the
magnetic pole on King William island, and his observations may
enable scientific men to clear up some obscure electric and magnetic
phenomena which long have puzzled them.
These gains fall very far short of what was once expected of the
northwest passage.
Many generations looked upon it as the pathway to gold, and
uncounted human skeletons are the only monuments to the daring
men who sought it.
The American continent, for the first centuries after its discovery,
was regarded by Europeans as a huge obstacle in a nearer way to the
East Indies. But time has proved that America is richer than all the
Indies, and world commerce no longer seeks a way around the conti
nent but to it
The first great advance In the exploration of the northwest pas
sage was made by John Davis, who discovered the strait named after
kirn in 1585. Adolf Erik Nordenskjold went clear through in 1879, but
not with his ship.
Now that Capt. Amundsen has at last realized the dream of cen
turies, perhaps it will be found that this, like other dreams, is brighter
In the dreaming than in the realization.
IT* no wonder Standard Oil gobbled up the Mutual Life. It
would have worked that side of the street sooned hadn't the McCurdys
worn gum shoes.
Aft last accounts the railroad rate rebate was still groggy from the
president's message, .

MEMORANDUM
NOT A RECIEPT
A misapprehension as to the
character of a piece of paper in
troduced in evidence at the trial
of County Commissioner George H.
Collin for bribery, before Justice
Hinkle on Saturday, led The Press
to represent the paper to be "a re
ceipt signed by George Collin," in
dicating that the official had signed
a receipt for commissions for coun
ty work, which not the fact.
The piece of paper is the myster
ious memorandum which appeared
in the course of the trial of Neth
ercutt last week. It was found on
a desk in the brndery by W. D.
Knight, when he became bookkeep
er at the bindery. But no evidence
other than that neither Taylor,
Edwards or Knight wrote it or
knew of its origin has ever been
brought out. Whether it is gen
uine as a memo or not has not
been established. On the fact of
it, it is a bookkeeper's n.emo of a
date before Knight entered the
bindery and long before any trou
ble arose between Collin and Neth
ercutt.

SUIT OPENED
(Scrlpps News Association.)
NEWARK, N. J., Dec. 18. — The
hearing of the divorce suit brought
by James B. Duke, president of the
American Tobacco Co., against
Lillian N. Duke was begun before
Vice Chancellor Pitney today. The
first question to be considered, is
the question of jurisdiction of the
court, the defendant having filed
affidavits declaring Mr. Duke not
a resident of New Jersey. It is
also asserted that the acts com
plained of in the bill are all alleged
to have been committed in New
York city and that during all the
period named in the bill all the
parties were actually living in a
foreign state.

(Scrlpps News Association.)
NEWPORT, R. 1., Dec. 18. — At
the last meeting of the city coun
cil of Newport a notice was re
ceived from the Rev. Dr. Brad din
Hamilton of New York, whose sum
mer home is at Hawthorne Villa,
acting for a number of the summer
resident of Newport, whose names
were not given in the notice, that
at the coming session of the gen
eral assembly of Rhode Island a bill
would be introduced to divide the
city of Newport, the southern sec
tion of the city. In which most of
the cottagers live, to be known as
South Newport. The reasons giv
en for such action are unjust tax
ation and the failure of the city
council to respect the wishes of
the summer residents, who are said
to pay at least 65 per cent of the
taxes of the city. A similar ac
tion has been served on the city
clerk. It is believed that the city
council will strongly oppose a di
vision of the city.

Lions and Leopards.
Albert H, Modrick.
"Some years ago, before I became
connected with Lincoln park," said I
Animal Keeper Randolph Schillings
whose hunting experiences are such |
as to make President Roosevelt's [
feats see mtarne, "I was in the ojd
World hunting wild beasts in the
fastnesses of the steppe, and never
to be forgotten by me are the hours
which I spent in 1899 following the
track of 14 lions. I had never be
fore met such a number of lions in
one troop. The impressions made
by the mighty paws of the animals
were clearly defined in the line dust
which covered the dry ground—an
expressive writing for the well
trained hunter.
"There is a strange fascination,
r.s may be supposed, in following
the traces of wild beasts into the
fastnesses of the steppe, in the case
of my tracking the 14 lions this
eagerness was alloyed with a
goodly amount of anxiety. One's
imagination loves to picture the
possible situation and outcome
which the pursuit of the beasts may
bring about. So did mine on that
occasion.
"Having reached the top of a hill
I saw the lions resting among the
rocks in the shade of some locust
trees. But, alas! —or, perhaps,
should I not rather say fortunately?
—the animals withdrew from sight
as soon as they had become aware
of my presence. I often had similar
experiences that the lions were so
nea rand yet so far.
"One of the most blood-stirring
adventures I had was with a leo
pard near Pangani, when I set out.
on my journey into the interior in
the same year. I had gone back
to town, accompanied by but one
man, and, returning toward evening
to my camp, my attention was
drawn to a tree on which a crowd
of baboons were shrieking with all
their might.
"It may not be generally known,
but, since monkeys are preyed on
by the leopard, 1 concluded that the
baboons were directing their wrath
against one of the stealthy cats in
a nearby thicket.
"I penetrated a few feet into the
jungle, when something ahead of
me began to move, while the mon
keys followed in the tops of the
trees. The thicket grew less dense,
and I soon found myself on the
edge of a ravine, when I saw, about
90 feet away, a strong leopard drag
ging a half grown baboon.
"I raised my rifle, but before I
eoudl fin- the beast had dropped
the monkey and escaped with a
mighty leap into the ravine.
"It is very hard to hit a fleeing
leopard—it is surely belter for the
hunter to miss the beast than
merely to wound it, as a wounded
leopard is a most dangerous en
emy when it turns and charges the
hunter; its movements are as quick
as lightning, hardly allowing one
to take aim. Although I knew this
from personal experience, and al
though 1 had made up my mind to
shoot leopards only under most
favorable conditions, I always
yielded to the temptation whenever
I got a chance to shoot.
"On one occasion my fOOlharrU
ness brought me within an inch of
losing my life. I noticed in the
sand of the steppe the track of a
leopard dragging Its prey. They
led me to the high bank of a ravine
washed out by rain. I went all
around it and found the animal had
not left it. Soon r made out the
leopard lying with its prey, a small
antelope, in a hole under the roots
of a tree.
"But the beast had noticed me
also, and, leaving its prey behind,
tried to steal away, at the same
moment I llred. A trail of bloodd
proved that I had hit the animal,
but had not killed it.
"Going along the high and steep
embankment, I noticed the beast
cowering half hidden by tho roots
of a tree, the distance between us
being about 75 feet. At the same
moment that I raised my rifle to
take a telling shot, the leopard
leaped toward me quick as light
ning. I saw the beast clawing the
edge of the ravine and almost
touching my feet, and I felt that
there was no escape possible, and
no defense, either, when the leo
pard jiunpe.l hack Into the ravine as
quickly as it had attacked me.
"The sight of my two native com
panions, who put in an appearance
just at that time, apparently had
scared the anlma; so much as Its
sudden appearance h'Bu staggered
my men. A few seconds lafef a
well aimed shot freed us of al! fur
ther danger.
"Adverting to lions, perhaps the
worst luck, from a hunter's point
of view, I had was when I failed
to kill the strongest maned lion I
ever met with in the wilderness.
"One day, while stalking water
bucks, I saw an animal hiding in
the bushes. Soon I made it out to
be a maned lion or unusual size.
He had scented me and galloped
away before I could take good aim.
fhe bullet I sent after him did not
miss him quite, as I coudl see from
the bloody trail.
"I followed it for a distance, but
without being able to overtake the
wounded beast. My men found the
carcass of a big lion a fortnight
later. He had worked his way into
the heart of the thicket so that
even the vultures could not get at
him. I eoudl only save the skull,
the biggest I had ever seen.
"All in all, I caught 37 lions in
traps during my stay and hunting
in the old world. A few strong
beasts had dragged the 60 pounds
of iron attached to the traps for
long distances an hour or more.
The asses and cattle I used as bait
had all been stung by the poisonous
tsetse fly. The qquick bite of the
felines simply shortened their
otherwise slow and painful death.
The trapped and runaway lions
had often forced their way so deep
Lnt othe thickets of reeds and grass
and thorny bushes that I had to
climb neighboring trees so as to
get a shot at them.
"Once I caught in traps a whole
family consisting of three lionesses
and six almost full grown whelps.
Tho first night three were caught,
the second night four, and the third
night two.
"A lion born in the wilderness,
but full grown In captivity, can give
zoo visitors but a faint idea of what
the 'king of the desert' really is In
a state of liberty, ruling tho free,
great, wild steppe. Likewise, the
leopard, which, indeed, is one of
the most dangerous and formidable
beasts of prey in East Africa. They
are often hunted and killed by
lions. Its haunts, by the way, may
be found anywhere In East Africa,
it having no preference for any spe
cial locality—on rocky ground as
well as in wooded districts —in fact,
wherever it finds sufficient cover.
It easily climbs trees, and often
hides during a hot day in their
shady tops, To my personal know
ledge men were Jumped on and
killed by beasts concealed In the
foliage—as in the case of a negro,
for instance, who was about to
climb a mango tree."
