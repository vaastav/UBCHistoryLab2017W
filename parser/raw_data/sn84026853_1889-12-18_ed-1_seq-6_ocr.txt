GREAT FIBE IN BOSTON. !
I
A Fearful Conflagration in the
Heart of the City.
Nearly Two Acres of Valuable j
Property Burned.
Just, as Boston was awakening to the most
essentially Puritan of all feast days there
came from the old city through the storm
the ringing of bells, not in thanksgiving, but
in warning, heralding to the business men in
all parts of the town that flames were raging
in the midst of the most valuable
commercial district of Boston and that
some of the terrors of 1872 were again before
them. For nearly four hours they saw costly
buildings and merchandise go up in flame anil
smoke, they saw structures that have been
erected in comparatively recent years, with
every improvement and safeguard against
fire, splinter aud crash together as though I
they were of the most inconsequential material;
and it was only after this long fight >
of the firemen, who were made desperate by !
the fearful odds against them, and after reinforcements
had come from more than a score
of the adjoining towns, that the fire was controled.
There stood at Bedford and Kingston streets
a solidly built six-storied granite building,
owned by Jordan. Marsh & Co., the great
dry goods house, and occupied in part by
them and in part by Brown, Durrell & Co.,
wholesale dealers in notions, and the "W'oonsocket
Rubber Company. It was regarded
as thoroughly fire-proof. Not very long
after 8 o'clock a. m. a letter carrier
saw a glare iu the upper part of the building
and scarcely had heard the roar of the fire
within before there was an explosion in .the
upper story, aud. with a flash like that of the
discharge of a field of artillery, the flames
burst through the shutters and sashes of the |
structure and sent the debris about his ear?, i
There was no time for hesitancy, but it seems |
that there was some, for the alarm
from the fire-alarm box nearly op
posite the burning ounuing was not rung m
for several minutes after the discovery of the
fire. It was raining as hard as Boston has
experienced in many years, there was a very
high wind blowing, "and everything was favorable
for a rapjd extension of the blaze.
Great buildings were all about, jammed
with valuable merchandise. The flames,
which, it was subsequently ascertained,
started in the elevator shaft, bad
full opportunity to obtain a powerful
draft, and in almost as short a time as
it requires to write it the interior of the
edifice was as a furnace. There was nothing
human which could stop the progress of the
flames northward through the party walls
of the adioining building of the .Shoe and
Leather Exchange, and which were making
this structure as dangerous to the surrounding
property as the first one proved to be.
Meanwhile a few engines had arrived, but
for some reason the firemen did not seem to
appreciate the enormity of the danger. They
first sent in an alarm for assistance but it was
not until the destruction of the Shoe and
Leather Exchange was inevitable that the
firemen were aroused. Thus the fire had a
headway of quite half an hour before a
force of firemen which would have been
adequate at the beginning of the conflagration
arrived on duty. The high wind fanned
the flames and forced them across Bedford
.street, a distance of not more than seventy
feet, where they were dammed by the corner
building and forced again westward acrossKingston
and along Bedford street to Chauncey,
where the fire was stopped for a time
in the store of Farley, Harvey & Co.. the
upper stories of which were burned. Three
stores along Chauncey street were also de- 1
stroyed. On the south side of Bedford street j
the flames leaped across Kingston street j
from the furnace that still raged in Brown, i
Durrell & Co.'s building to the biz sandstone !
structure owned by F. ?. Ames ami occupied ]
by Taylor Brother?, completely destroying !
it.
' It was not long before steamer* from Wal- j
tham, Cambridge, Maiden. Melrose, Law^
rence and Haverhill arrived, and some tim<M|
after the Providence fire laddies made their j
appearance with one engine. Then Waltham I
sent in its quota, and it was with full ap- j
preciation of the pathos of it all that
the engine from Lynn arrived. There
was a cheer which went up when
the boys came in and went to work, though
they had scarcely had time to recover from
the great calamity which had visited their
own city. But the effect of their pluckiness
was contagious. Men who had not done
more than their share up to this time bent
their backs, and, with a whoop and a hurrah
which meant all things save defeat,
?' the firemen, many of them badly
scorched, went at the flames again
with a will, and assisted by the storm, made
further progress of the fire unlikely. Up to
this time the number of available men was
too small to surround the district and to fight
the flames from all quarters. The heat from
the flames, too, was more than it was possible
fA wifV?c+r?rtrl cn t.hf fViA
battle for the salvation of property was con- j
tinued with the flames always in the van anil
the firemen in their rear endeavoring to j
quench them from the most unlikely point.
The scene in 'Bedford street at 11 o clock
was appalling. Bricks from fallen wails
covered the street to a depth of five feet, and
two helpless engines and a tower
which had fallen victims to the great avalanche
of sfone and brick mutely told
of the terrible struggle which had taken
"lace to stop the progress of destruction.
At that hour the fire had supreme
possess' "n o* many massive buildings, and the
large freestone oICC- northwest
corner of Kingston and Bedford streets was
in an extremely dangerous condition. The
firemen worked in and around it at moof
bein" e?<mlfed ben ?>?> '
*the tottering walls of its" tippsr story.
At 1 o'clock the fire was confined to the upper
stories of the two large stone buildings at the
corner of Bedford and Chauucey streets,
occupied, one by Farley, Harvey 6c Co., and
the other by Smith, Hogg & Gardner. At
times it burned out for a moment, but under
the well-directed streams of the firemen was

Tinder control.
A careful estimate of the area burned over
before the fire was under control places the
number of square feet at 75,(100, or about one
acre and three-quarters. Seventy buildings
were burned, most of them being mammoth
wholesale business houses of stone and brick,
fortified by every known modern appliance
for the prevention of loss by fire. The aggregate
loss is variously estimated at from H000,000
to $6,000,000.
The scene of the fire was identical with
that of the conflagration of 1872, when the
total of losses were $75,000,000. The alarm
was rung out, too, from the same box, No.
- 52.
Daring the fire fourteen firemen were
knocked down in Kingston street by fragments
of a broken wall, but all escaped serious
injury. About a dozen firemen and
policemen were sent to the hospitals suffering
from lacerations, bruises and broken
limbe.

THE NEW SPEAKER.
Sketch of ?lie Career of Thomas B j
Reed, of Maine.
THOMAS B. REED.
congressman Tom Keed, of Maine, was j
nominated in the Republican caucus on the |
second ballot for Speaker of the House of j
Representatives, and was elected when Con- i
gress opened.
Mr. Reed's career has been a somewhat un- j
eventful one, being marked by little beyond
his steady political promotion. He was born |
in the old seaport city of Portland, on the I
18th of October, 1839. He was educated at j
Bowdoin College, at Brunswick, Maine,
where he graduated at the age of twenty-one.
This was in the year preceding the outbreak
of the Civil War, and during the first
part of that conflict Mr. Reed was engaged
in the study of law. In 1S04, however, on
the 19th of April, he accepted an appointment
as acting assistant paymaster m the
United States navy, an office which he continued
to hold for more than eighteen
months.
On leaving the navy in November, 1865,
after the close of the war, Mr. Reed returned
to his legal studies, and was soon afterward
admitted to the bar of his native State. He
commenced to practice his profession in j
Portland; but he took so active an interest j
in public affairs, and his talents drew
him so rapidly to the front, that with
him law soon became subordinate to
politics. In 186S ho was clected to the Maine
House of Representatives, and after serving
for two years in that body became a member
of the State Senate in 1870. Then for three
successive years he was Attorney-General of
Maine, and for four more years City Solicitor i
or roruanci.
He was first elected to the National Legis- j
lature in 1876, when the First District of his I
State chose him as its representative in the !
Forty-fifth Congress. He has been at Wash- j
ington continuously from that time, and is j
now the foremost Republican member of the j
lower house.
life-saving service.
Many People Rescued and Much i
Property Saved in a Year.
General Superintendent Kimball, of the
Life-Saving Service, in his annual report
says that at the close of the last fiscal year I
the establishment embraced 225 stations, 172
being on the Atlantic. 45 on the lakes, 7 on
the Pacific and 1 at the Falls of the Ohio,
Louisville, Ky.'
The work of the crews during the year is j
summarized as follows: Number of disasters, ;
52S; value of property involved, $6,416,775;
value cf property saved, $5,054,440; value of I
property lost, $1,362,335; number of persons 1
involved, 3426; number of persons lost, 42; :
number of persons succored, 787; days of !
succor afforded, 172G; number of vessels totally
lost, 63; number of vessels otherwise i
aided by crews, that is, worked off when
stranded, repaired when damaged, piloted I
out of danger, etc., 510; number of vessels )
warned from danger by signals of patrol- :
men, 217; number of persons rescued who j
had fallen fi om wharves, piers, etc., 34.

Tlie caTse of the lynching was the burning |
by an incendiary of several barns on the

for revenge by Joe Vermillion, whose
father was maltreated the night before by a
number of men. All of the Vermillion boys

DASTARDLY LYNCHERS.
! A Partially Insane Man Hanged by a
Masked 31ob.
Hans Jacob Olseu, aged ftfty years, was
torn from his house at Preston, Wis., and
lynched by.ap?rtyof masked men. Olsen
was partially insane and somewhat quarrelsome,
and had been ordered by neighbors
to leave the country. He was seized in bed,
pulled out aud his hands tied behind him
despite his desperate struggles and the
screams of the family. Without even allowing
him time to put on his clothes the men led him
out of the house. Once outside Olsen learned
what was to be done with him. He caught
sight of a new rope hanging over the limb
of a large tree which stands not more than
twenty feet frOm the little cabin which was
I his home. He struggled to free his hands,
j tearing the flesh from his wrists until they
I bled freely; but flndiug himself unable to get
! loose submitted in sullen silence. The rope
! ..-.ic nut. nround his ncck and willing bands
ilrow him up to strangle. His logs were not
tied and his kicking and struggling were
i fearful. The lynchers remained some time,
j however, lest he might bo cut down before
ho was dead. Then, after shouting threats
] of lynching any ono who should dare
j cut down the body, they dispersed.
The body was discovered in the
morning, but was not cut down
until the Coroner arrived. No evidence as
to the identity of the lynchers was offered
before the Coroner's jury. In Preston it is
common gossip that the lynchers were led by
one of the most prominent farmers in Freston.
Olsen had served five years in State Prison

FIFTY-FIRST CONGRESS.
i The Nation's lair-Makers Once
More in Session.
New House Officers Elected and
New Senators Sworn In,
The Fifty-first Congress of the United
States has started on its career at the Nation's
Capitol. The House of Representatives was
called to order at noon by John B. Clark,
the Clerk of the House in the Fiftieth Con
j gress. Long before that hour the corridors
of the Capitol were thronged with men, women
and children. The doors of the House
galleries were closed against them for a time
because of a caucus of Democratic Representatives
in progress, and the first tendency of
the throng was to turn in the direction of
the Senate Chamber, where the galleries and
floor were both open. The greater interest
centred in the House, and a crowd gradually
assembled about ite doors that packed the
hallways and made progress through them
a matter of extreme difficulty When the
doors were thrown open not only the galleries
but the floor of the House quickly
! filled with strangers. ,
i Magnificent floral designs were carried
| here and there on the floor of the House by
! pages, and the odor of roses filled the air. A
j nandsome but unobtrusive basket graced the
| Speaker's desk. Two desks were necessary
I to prop up an immense floral horseshoe and a
! floral chair, each bearing the inscription:
| "Our Little Giant," sent to McCarthy of New
York city by his admirers. Houk, of Ten'
nessee, was the recipient of a superb floral
j Ship of State.
The roll call of the House showed 372 mem!
bers present. Nominations for Speaker
i were then made. Mr. Henderson, of Illinois,
j nominated Thomas B. Reed, of Maine, and
i Mr. McCreery, of Kentucky, nominated
j John G. Carlisle, of that State.
I The vote resulted: For ReecT, 16ti: for c'arj

I and Carlisle amid applause, and the oatli of

! chair Speaker Reed said: "Gentlemen of the
! House of Representatives: I thank yon for
| the high office which your voices liave bestowed
upon me. It would be impossible not
to be moved by its dignity and honor; yet
you may well imagine I am at this
moment more impressed by its responsibilities
and duties. Under our system of government
as it has been developed, these
responsibilities and duties are both political
ana parliamentary. So far as the duties are
political,? I" sincerely]hope that?they may
be performed with a proper sense of what is
due to all the people of the whole country.
So far as they are parliamentary I hope with
equal sincerity that they may be performed
with a proper sense of what is due to both
sides of the Chamber."
Mr. Reed then took the Speaker's chair,
and all the Representatives were sworn in.
Mr. Henderson, of Illinois, next offered a
resolution declaring the election of the
Republican caucus nominees. They
were Mr. McPherson, . of Penn
sylvania, for Clerk; Mr. Holmes, of
Iowa, for Sergeant-at-Arms; Mr. Adams, of
Maryland, for Doorkeeper; Mr. Wheat, of
Wisconsin, for Postmaster, and the Rev.
Charles Ramsdell for Chaplain. All these

Opening of the Senate.
There was little or no excitement attending
the opening of the Fifty-first Confess on the
Senate side of the Capitol. The public
curiosity seemed to be largely transferred to
the House side. Flowers adorned the seats of
several Senators.
At noon Vice-President Morton entered the
chamber, and the Chaplain, the Rev. J. G.
Butler, opened the proceedings with an invocation
for the Divine blessing, closing with
the Lord's Prayer.
Sen>iors Chandler, of New Hampshire,
and E'ijon, of Rhoda Island, were sworn in.

of South Dakota, and Senators Squire

from North Dakota had not yet reached

President was ; nnounced and read by the
Secretary of the Senate.

Seven Deaths Caused by Fire in
Philadelphia.
Fire broke out about 2:30 a. m. in the
three-story brick building at tiia corner of
Second and Huntingdon streets. Philadelphia.
The basement aud first floor were
used by Gustave Gross as a bakeshop
and store respectively. The second floor was
occupied as a dwelling by Gross, his wife
and four children, and on the third floor
dwelt Joseph Bitner with his wife and six
children.
The flames, which started in the basement,
burned quickly through the upper floors,
and the following persons were burned to
death: Mrs. Minnie Gross, Mrs. Annie Bitner,
Ida Bitner, George Bitner, Gustave
Gross, Bruno Gross, Mattie Gross.
As soon as the firemen learned that there
were people in the house, they turned their
attention to rescuing them, but the flames
had already made such headway that their
efforts were almost fruitless. Truckman
Hugh Smith climbed up the awning-post
and into the second story
window. He made his way through the
smoke to the bed on which little Gustave
Gross lay, and picking him up, got him safely
out of the building. The lad had, however,
inhaled so much smoke that he died
half an hour afterward.
TI-kA wJfft r\f Pifnov onrl twn of thfeil*
children, Ida, aged six years, and George,
a babe of nine months, were in tne
third-story front room and were
suffocated by the smoke. When found by
the firemen after the flames had been subdued,
the mother and her children were huddled
together on the floor. Mrs. Bitner was
clad only in her night dress, but she had her
shoes on, as though preparing to escape when
overcome by the smoke.
Mrs. Gross and her children were asleep on
the second floor. She clasped her two-anda-half-year-old
daughter Mattie in her arms,
and, hurrying to the third floor, jumped
from a window to the street
below. She was immediately conveyed
with her child to the Episcopal Kosi
pita), a short distance away, where the child
I died soon after being admitted. Mrs. (Jross
was horribly burned,and in addition suffered
a compound fracture of the arm. She died
shortly after 5 o'clock in the afternoon.
After the fire the firemen found the dead
body of Bruno Gross, aged five years, in the
bathroom on the second floor, burned almost
to a crisp. Freda Gross, aged seven.and Clara
Bitner, aged fourteen, jumped from a second
story window, and were caught in the arms
of Mr. Gross. These two escaped without injury.
Fritz Erdman, an apprentice, aged
fifteen, also jumped from the second story
and escaped unhurt.
Ix the pottoffice building in New York city
there are 800,000 European postal cards.
Ten years ago Postmaster-General James ordered
1,000,000 of these postal cards, supposing
they would probably bo used in a year
or so, for they could go anywhere in Europe
and cost only two cents. In ten years only
200,000 of tbem have been sold.
- INTERIOR
DEPARTMENT.
A Synopsis of Secretary Noble's Annual
Report?The Pension Question.
The annual report of John W. Noble, See*,
retary of the Interior, begins by calling attention
to the consummation of the following
important events that have taken place j
during this Administration, namely: The- . ^
opening of Oklahoma, the successful nego- "
tiation of a treaty with the Sioux Indians of
Dakota, and the advent into the Union of
the four new States, North Dakota, SouthDakota,
Washington and Montana, noneh
aving entered previously for thirteen years.
The Secretary calls attention to the wantof
Territorial Government in Oklahoma and
urges speedy action by Congress.
The eleventh census, while comprising alL
the investigations undertaken in the tenth,
will include two additional and important
features: an inquiry'in relation to the recorded
indebtedness of private corporations
and individuals, and a list of the names, organizations
and. length of service of surviving
soldiers, sailors and marines, and their
widows.
It is recommended that the Census Office
be made a permanent bureau. On the subject
of pensions the report saffs:
"The estimates for npnsions made for the
fiscal year beginning July 1, 1889, were not
only inadequate but must have been known
to be so when recommended to Congress. The
estimate for the previous year was 180,000,000.
But before this estimate for {;
the present year was completed it was apparent
that a deficiency would be incurred,
as it was incurred, for the previous year, to
the amount of at least $8,000,000, and tnat
this added to the original eighty millions,
would not be enough to meet the obligations
accruing before the end of even that
fiscal year.
"It is recommended that a pension be
granted to every soldier and sailor who did
substantial service during the war in the a
Army or Navy and was honorably discharged
therefrom, and who, being dependent
on his daily labor for his
support is now, or may hereafter be^
disabled from procuring his subsistence
by such labor. A due regard to its own
dignity and character should prevent the > ;
Government from allowing any of the men
who fought to maintain the Union to suffer . v
from want, when they have become , r m
so incapacitated. It is well known to
all our people that many who were
never disabled in the fight or the service
were yet those who met the greatest dangers
of the war and who served continuously
and faithfully. That Providence saved them
from wounds or disease, and that their strong
constitutions withstood the hardships of the
field, give no reason why they should be left disregarded
and unsupported now. The pension
is paid by the Government in reward for ' -
past services to those who fought to maintain
its existence. It has the sanction
of the law of self-preservation, which no
Government in the treatment of its veterans
can safely ignore. The preservation of the
nation, for which these men fought and en
ciurea so mucn vo secure, uu givou w ?> uu
people a wonderful degree of prosperity and
an unlimited ability to pay any obligations
honor imposes. I am not disposed to confer
upon all who may ask the money of the
people, and would have confined to well-ascertained
limits the claims of those who demand
a pension. Nevertheless, a disregard -{>
of those of the service named whose disability
has become since the war so great as to
make them dependent would be both unjust
to them and unworthy of our country."
The Secretary reviews the system of rerating
and the payment of large sums of money i<
as oack pensions under the rerating, and the
work of the Committee appointed to investigate
it He makes an extended legal argument
on the question,with the following conclusion:
"Increased pensions cannot be ordered at the
mere will of the Commissioner; it requires
a claim, an examination and a certificate;
such increase is not a matter of sentiment
it is a questionlaw."

THE POSTAL SERVICE.
j Postmaster-General Wanamaker*ihj^|
Annual Report Summarized. I^H
Postmaster-General Wanamaker, in his ^
! first annual report, recommeuds that the
I offices of a Fourth Assistant Postmaster!
General and of a General Secretary?the
! latter at a salary of $10,000?be made, so as
i to enable the head of the department to
render better service.
Referring to his correspondence with the
Western Union Telegraph Company, Mr.
Wanamaker savs:
"I respectfully ask that such legisiauuu
( be enacted as is necessary to empower the
Postmaster-General to enter into contract
with responsible parties for a term not exceeding
five years, on conditions favorable
to the Government, for the purpose of establishing
a Limited Post and Telegraph Service."
On the subject of Sunday mails Mr. Wanamaker
says:
j "I shall make use of all proper means tending
toward the minimizing of postoffice work
upon Sunday, because I believe that the Government
should, as far as possible, make no
requirements which will prohibit its employes
from the enjoyment of a day of rest."
In touching upon the subject of penny
; postage the report says:
' "Oue-eent postage is an easy possibility of
the near future. It must com? as a matter
of course. If introduced to-morrow the cutting
in half of postage would reduce the revenue
on letter postage by probably $13,0?'i>,000.
"We are not ready for this while ti:o
present deficiency exists. When the blessing
of penny postage comes it should not require
a tax in some other form to make up its cost. ^
Moreover, it would seem to br? wiser first to &
improve the facilities rather than to reduce fl
the postage while the service still remains S
conspicuously imperfect."
As to postal savings banks, the Postmas~^^H
ter-General suggests that they be established
at 10,000 of the tourta-ciass unices iui ^inconvenience
of the people wauting a placs to
deposit their money, but expresses uo opinion
on the suggestion that the Government
pay interest to depositors. The report refei-3
to the pressing need for the erection of a departmental
building at Washington and urges.
that this be done. j
