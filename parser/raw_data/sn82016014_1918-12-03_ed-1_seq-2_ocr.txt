THIS BY SENATOR SHERMAN
Some Feel It Unwise To Send
' Ah road a Committee.
Hitchcock Advocates "Barring"
Wilson From Acting President.
j
. Washington, Dec. 3. Senator Hitch
cock, chairman of the senate foreign
relations committee today advocated
passage of a resolution declaring Pres
ident Wilson "unable" to perform the
duties of his office while abroad.
v Hitchcock's attitude r;as a surprise
to other Democrats. He explained it
by saying:
"My personal opinion is that the
senate should do something to settle
thd matter definitely, to say who is
president. I believe the supreme
court, if called on to rule on a reso
lution declaring 'resident Wilson un
able, by reason of his absence, to per
form the functions of his office, would
hold tjiat congress is the best judge
Of the eafecMtive'a ability or inability
function- In my opinic. on the
matter I am at variance with most of
the, Democrats.''
Discuss Resolution.
Hitchcock announced that the for
eign relations committee will meet
this week to discuss the Cummins
resolution creating a senate committee
to attend the peace conference- The
Sherman resolution to be introduced
today, declaring the office of president
vacant and seating Vice President
Marshall for the remainder of the
term, probably will go to the judiciary
Committee. Hitchcock today called
Jtha Sherman resolution "absurd."
"I think t not probable that the
Cummins resilution will be favor
aWy;.rfP?rtis by the foreign relations
fammitteeV said Hitchcock. "I do
xrot betteve It will pass the senate. I
have no disposition. however, to
Km other it in committee. It should
t given its fair chance in the senate.
It- is likely, therefore, that this com
mittee will report it without recom
mendation. i'"Home senators feel that it would be
unwise to send abroad a committee
that, because of its unofficial position,
WpuW be subject to snubs and which
flight embarrass our peace delegates
a-nd the senate. Others think that the
supreme importance of having the
annate take part, thru discussions here,
pt peace terms contemporaneously
Uhj the peaces-conference, warrants
the sending of the committee."
The Whole Senate.
j Senator IMtt mean's amendment to
end the whole senate to Paris will not
receive serious consideration.
The house judiciary committee
probably will be in no hurry to meet
rt the Kodenburg resolution substi
tuting the vice president for the presl
eVnti during th latter's absence, Chair
man Webb indicated today.
r -Hitchcock said that neither he nor
tether Democratic leaders had devised
4 try plan as a substitute for the Cum
mins resolution as a means of keeping
Che senate informed of developments.
believe the senate will have full
ii.'formauon," he said. "The discus
ilpns'here, I feel, will have consider
able Influence abroad, as reflecting
American public opinion on the ques
tions under discussion."
Must Keep Head.
publican opposition to the Cum
mins plan grew today. Senator Wat
bn, leading Republican, declared "the
senate must keep its head and do
nothing to alienate the country."
$ Other Republicans said they will
vote against the Cummins resolution.
The generally expressed Republican
View of President Wilson's message
" was that it was disappointing with re
spect to filling the demand for further
light on certain of the fourteen prin
ciples of peace terms. Republicans
said .they expected some definition of
freedom of the seas, amplification of
the leacue of nations man. and a state
Ttyint of just .how the president ex
. pects to impress-his views abroad.

me, so that thinking men can under
stand what they mean. As to the
freedom of the seas, there may be
some vagueness, but that grows out of
the fact that no satisfactory definition
hus ever been evolved pn that point
by any body. The president is pre-
servine a wise measure or reticence,
so as not to tell the enemy all he hopes
to do nor how he hopes to do it. That
would be poor strategy."
On this point .senator Hitchcoca
called attention to the fact that when
the fourteen peace terms were first,
enunciated "there was no adverse
comment, but much that was favor
able. The assumption rightly follows
that the terms were accepted by the
American people aa an expression of
their views and so long as President
Wilson stuys within those fourteen
terms, T don't see thnt he will be do
ing anything extraordinary."

with the $12,274,000,000 appropriated

HARD TO SETTLE
Says Congress of the Railroad
Question as It Stands.
May Reach. So Agreement at
the Session Opening.
GALL FOR INVESTIGATION
Cannot Let Roads Go Bark on
Their Pre-War Basis.
But Congressmen Do "ot Know
What They Will Do.
Washington, Dec. 3. Settlement of
the railroad problem at this session of
! congress will be practically impos
I sible, leaders of both houses declare
today- They based the assertion upon
pi hurried survey of the situation, fol
: lowing President Wilson's request in
his message that congress immediately
evolve a plan of railroad control,
which will eliminate evils that existed
when the government took the lines as
a war measure.
Senators Smith, South Carolina: Un
derwood, Alabama; Cummins. Iowa;
and Representatives Esch and Kims;
members of the interstate commerce
committees df the two houses, con
curred in this view. They and prac
tically all other members of congress
agreed heartily with the president's
assertion that the roads cannot be
turned back under pre-war conditions.
As to the degree of modification, the
views rangea irom complete govern
ment ownership, and operation to
slighf changes in existing laws.
Xo Plan in Mind.
Senator Smith and Representative
Sims, chairmen of the two committees,
both stated they have no plan in mind
for attacking'the problem which the
president puts squarely up to congress.
Within a short time they will call
meetings of their respective commit
tees to outline the speediest way of
dealing with the matter, in view of the
president's intimation that undue de
lay by congress will lead him to turn
the railroads back just as he took
them.
"It is my clear impression that the
president intends, if there is no legis
lation in the near future to restore
the railroads to their owners," said
Senator Underwood. "It is a physi
cal impossibility for there to be any
legislation at the present session. It
therefore,- seems obvious to me that
the president's attitude will result in
throwing this problem into the lap of
the new congress which the Republi
cans will control."
Approacli It Openly.
Senator Cummins, who after March
4, succeeds Senator Smith as chair
man of the interstate commerce com
mittee, said congress should "ap
proach the question with open minds
ready to hear all that is to be said
and willing to view it from every
'standpoint and then decide without
fear, favor or prejudice. This does
not mean that members snouia dis
card their convictions, but it does
mean that we must hold our Judg
ment subject to the change which in
vestigation, argument and reason may
require."
Cummins urged immediate opening
of a painstaking investigation upon
which to base action. He is generally
regarded as favoring public owner
ship. Representative Ksch, who on March
4, becomes chairman of the house
committee said:
Make an Investigation.
"The railroad investigation should
be made by the joint committee for
merly headed by Senator Newlands.
It is the only body I know of which
has even made a start on an investiga
tion along the required lines. Its life
ends January 1, but it could, be ex
tended." Ksch is a member of this commit
tee, which already has gathered more
than 7,000 pages of testimony regard
ing railroad operation.
"I do not believe," he continued,
"that the federal government should
retain any powers such -as it now has,
such as ordering Interchange of ser
vice, distribution of equipment and
rerouting by shortest routes."
NEFARIOUS PLOTS OUT
ftermans Had Germs of Disease Stored
Bombs for Italian Anarchists.
Tendon, Dec. 3. Additional details
of German pleas to sow dissension
among the allies are published in
copies of the Swiss National Times of
Zurich, received here today.
Germs of cholera and glanders were
stored in Zurich by the Germans who
were also making bombs and muni
tions in secret. According to the news
paper, ths bacteria were intended for
the poisoning of wells in territory
r.andoned to the allies by the Ger
mans. The bombs and munitions were
intended to aid anarchists in Italy in
fomenting a revolution in that coun
try. POPE IN AN APPEAL

same time the pope asked the allied
bishops to make a similar request of

GEN. MARTIN IS BACK
Kansas Military Leader a Passenger
on Rcturnlns Ship.
New York. Dec. S. Brig-. Gen. Chas.
I. Martin was a passenger on the troop
ship Northern Pacific, which arrived
at Hoboken. Monday, carrying- 1,000
wounded soldiers.
Brig. Gen. Charles I. Martin's re
turn to Kansas was indicated several
weeks ago in a dispatch announcing
mat several ongaaier generate naa
been reduced to ranks of colonel and
command units materially changed.
General Martin's name appeared on
the list. It was assumed by men in
army circles that the well known Kan
san would probably return at an early
date.
General Martin won his first mili
tary recognition in the Spanish-Ameri
can war. where he served as an off!
cer in the famous fighting Twentieth
Kansas. He was made adjutant gen
eral by Governor Stubbs in 1 9 10,
having previously served four ears
tia oLtiuo t-iiu.i.t'r 1 1 u in Kuyruuii utili
ty. General Martin was reappointed
by Governor Hodges, Democrat, and
by Governor Capper, Republican. In
1116, General Martin went with the
national guard to the Mexican border.
When the guard organizations were
federalized in 1917. the Kansas com
mander was commissioned a brigadier
general and last spring accompanied
the troops to France after more than
six months training at Camp Doni
phan. General Martin was in com
mand of the Sixtieth brigade compos
ed of the 139th and 140th infantry.
BAVARIA IS CHANGING
Kurt Isnrr, Premier, Losing and Ac- j
tion for Monarchy Is Expected, j
London, Dec. 3. Kurt Eisner, the
Bavarian premier, is losing prestige,
according to a Danish advice received
here by the way of Amsterdam, Cop
enhagen and Berne. A Copenhagen
dispatch says that Eisner was hissed
oy his own partisans at Munich dur
ing a celebration in honor of return
ing soldiers. Later a supporter of
Eisner was not allowed to make a
speech and was obliged to flee from
an angry crowd which removed the
red flags along the streets and storm
ed the ministry of the interior, shout
ing:
"Down with Eisner. Guards fired
over the heads of the crowd, which
dispersed. A Berne dispatch to the
Mail says it is believed that "Bavaria
is gradually reaching a conclusion to
retain its unity with the rest of Ger
many rather than seeking a separate
peace." This message also reports evi
dences of growing hostility toward
Eisner, adding that there are signs in
Munich that a crisis is approachina
and that action favoring some form
of monarchy may be taken within
three weeks.
BOCHE WILL BE SLOW
May Not Be Abro To Give Vp 5,000
lioeomotives by Teeember 21.
Paris, Dec 3. It appears the Ger
mans will he unable to hand over all
the 5,000 locomotives-stipulated in the
armistice agreement by December 21
according to the Matin and it is pos
sible that the allies will grant more
time to the enemy. This will have the
effect of delaying peace negotiations
since they cannot begin until the
armistice conditions have all been ful
filled. Discussions among the allied dele
gations to the peace conference will
probably begin' on December 20 with
President Wilson taking part person
ally. ALLSEEK FOR TRIAL

CONTROL PACKERS
Congress Is Expected To Act as
Result of Charges.
Price Regulation Thru Illegal
Combination, Was Stated.
Washington, Dec 3. Congressional
action to control the meat packers to
day promised to result from the fed
eral trade commission's charges of
illegal combination and price regula
tion In the trade. -
A conference of senators, including
Kenyon, Iowa, and Borah, Idaho, will
be- held soon to outline some course
of action to correct evils the trade
commission's two reports declare exist.
The problem facing those who want
action is how to retain the undoubted
utility of the meat industry machinery
without giving the firms mentioned by
the trade commission power to abso
lutely control meat supplies and
processes.
The flat charges that the packers
Armour. Swift, Morris, Cudahy and
Wilson now exercise this power thru I
a gigantic and close combination Is
made by the commission in a report
submitted to congress yesterday.
The trade commission's conclusions
as drawn from several hundred pages
of evidence are in the main:
That the five companies have di
vided up the country for their opera
tions in such a way as to allow them
to absolutely control both buying and
selling prices.
' That the companies exchange con
fidential information.
That the companies act cojluslvely
in buying and selling.
That Swift, Armour, Wilson and
Morris have combined to control the
South American cattle .market.
That all contribute to a Joint fund
to swing public opinion.
The "black; book" figures promi
nently in the report. This book con
tains the notes of various packers'
meetings and .was the property of Ger
mon S. Su!rberger of Sulzberger &
Sons, the report states.
One of the practices of the pack
ers to control prices of cattle, the re
port said, was to wire ahead when a
seller wag-not satisfied with the price
originally offered by one packer ana
was on his way to another. When
the seller reached the second buyer he
was offered the same price as the first
offered.
GOULD STOP REDS
So Says Baron Aexkuell, After
Fleeing From Esthonia.
L Few Cruisers Could Put an
End to Murder and Plunder.
(By tbe Associated Press)
Berlin, Monday, Dec 2 (delayed).'
If a few British torpedo boats or light
cruisers, with even a small landing
force could reach Keval this week.
they could dam the Bolshevist flood
which f has been murdering, burning
anu plundering Esthonia and Lavonia,
according to a declaration made to the
correspondent by Baron Aexkuell of
Esthonia, who escaped from that
country on Thursday in disguise.
Baron Aexkuell reports that Ger
maa forces had begun to evacuate
Narva when they were attacked and
defeated by Russian troops.
Last Tuesday, white guards eom
matided by former Russian officers
under the leadership of Count Keller,
of the Old Russian regime,, were at
tacked by a superior Bolshevist force.
The guards gave protection a month
ago to 51)0 Russians who alleged they
had deserted from the Bolshevist army
because of bad treatment. They
brought twenty-three machine guns
with them. "While the attack was pro
ceeding last Tuesday, these Russians
fired upon the white guards from the
rear, contributing materially to their
defeat. The white guards, half an
nihilated, retired. Esthonian workmen
are nearly all Bolshevists, according to
Baron Aexkuell. and the middle classes
of Esthonia and Iavonia are facing
the same reign of terror that the
bourgeoisie of Russia have suffered.

New York Stock Market.
Wall St.. New York. Dec. 31. STOCKS
Stocks were firm at the opening of todav s
trading, largely as a result of the strength
shown by minor rails and specialties, but
the market soon became irregular, oils and
shippings being mainly responsible for tl-e
reversal. Investment rails failed to hoid
the advantage guiued in yesterday's later
dealing and standard Industrials 4ud
equipments forfeited fractional gains. Fur
ther reactions set in before the end ot the
first half hour on the weakness of Marine
preferred.
Eicepttng Marine preferred which broke
5y- points, the market suddenly tnrned up
ward later. Italia were active but ma.le
only nominal gains, greatest strength be
ing shown by steels, equipments, motors,
coppers and oils. Chief among these were
Bethlehem and Crucible Steels, Baldwin,
ocomotlve. Smdebaker. American Cm.
Texas Company, Mexican Petroleum, in
which advances ranged from 2 to a points.
People's Gas, Corn Products. Distilling ir
sues and specialties shared modarBtely in
the rise which prompted extensive short
covering.
