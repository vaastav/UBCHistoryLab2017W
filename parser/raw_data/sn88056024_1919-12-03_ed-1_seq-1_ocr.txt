SECY. TREASURY
SAYS DEFICIT
WILL BE LARGE
In Annual Report to Congress
Carter Glass Says Books
Will Show $3,000,000,000
Deficit Next June.
By RALPH b\ COUCH
(United Press Staff Correspondent.)
Washington, Deo. 3.—A deficit of
more than $3,000,000,000 will show on
the books of the government on June
30. 1020, the close of the current fiscal
year, Secretary of the Treasury Glass
estimated in his annual report to con
gress today.
A deficit of $1.500,000,000 looms for
the next fiscal year. Glass also esti
mated.
All the figures given by Glass are
estimated or forecasts of conditions,
wliirlj according to knowledge now at
hand will prevail six months and a
>(f»ar and a half hence. Congress, how
ever, will use them in revamping tax
laws as suggested in President Wil
son's message and in paring appro
priations.
Starting with a balance of $1.002.
732,042 in the treasury at the close of
business June 30, 1919, Glass' figures
are summarized as follows:
Current fiscal year—Expenditures,
$11.486.627,219; next fiscal year. $3.973,
797,985. receipts for current fiscal
year, $7,318.006.634: next fiscal year,
$5,620,350,000; deficit close for current
fiscal year. $3,155,888,543; next fiscal
year, $1,509.326,528.
TABLES CERTAIN ITEMS.
Glass tabled as incomplete all items
of expenditure since congress may ap
propriate additional millions. The de
ficits as estimated, therefore, may be
increased at a time when many citi
zens complain of taxes as unjustly
burdensome.
Receipts estimated by Glass are on
the basis of the war tax law under
which taxes will be collected for the
. remainder of the Current fiscal year.
Unless congress makes swift changes.
These laws Glass showed in the re
port enabled this government to meet
more than 43 per cent of its war ex
penditures out of current receipts.
Among other things shown in the re
port are that:
Spanish-American war bonds total
ing $936.000 still are outstanding.
The world war cost the United
States $26.007,000,000 exclusive of loans
to the allies, totaling $9,406,000.000.
The gross public debt was $26.210,
530,000 at the close of business Octo
ber 31, of which $910,684,987.41 was
from sale of war savings certificates
and $20.443,314,359 from liberty bonds
and victory notes.
The funded war debt will be com
pletely retired in 45 years under the
cumulative sinking fund act of March
3, 1919.
Gold coin and bullion in the United
States totalled $2,872,525.066, November
1, or "about one-third of the world's
monetary stock."
Rising costs of labor and material
have "rendered gold mining progres
sively less and less profitable." and

Steps Already Taken to Make
Effective Certain of Presi
dent's Recommendations in
Reconstruction Message.
Washington, Dec.'S.—Steps were be
ing taken today to make effective some
of the recommendations President Wil
ron included in his "reconstruction
message" to congress.
Much of the necessary legislation is
already pending having been introduc
er. last session, and caught in the Jam
created by the treaty.
Hero is the reconstruction program
the president recommended as it
stands today:
BUDGET
The house has passed the Good bill
creating; a budget bureau under presi
dential direction and an independent
auditing system. A resolution elim
inating the seven appropriating com
mittees of the house and substituting
one committee will be considered as
scon as the senate passes the budget
bill. Representative Good, Iowa, chair
man of the budget committee, said to
da y.
Senator McCormick, Illinois, has pre
pared a much different measure for
introduction in the senate, delegating
budget making to the treasury depart
ment.
LABOR
Senator Sterling, South Dakota, Re
publican, said today he will soon re
introduce bis bill for compulsory in
vestigation and mediation of industrial
disputes. It provides a federal Inves
tigation board, empowered to step in
alter the board of mediation and con
ciliation lhas failed. The bill pro
hibits strikes or lockouts pending the
result of the ^federal investigation.
UNREST
Action will be sought on the Ster
I ng bill empowering criminal courts to
deal with anarchists, bolshevists and
"reds'* generally, Senator Sterling an
nounced.
Senator Poindexter has a similar bill
uimed at industrial organization. Sev
eral "Americanization" bills are -be
fore the senate labor committee.
HIGH COST OF LIVING
Bills to regulate cold storage, pack
ers Interstate distribution of food, and
extending the Lever food control act
are pending before agricultural com
mittees of both houses. There is much
opposition to all these measures. A
special senate committee headed by
Townsend, Michigan, appointed last
session to map out suitable legislation
has never reported.
TAXES AND TARIFF
Simplification of income profits tax
es will be necessary Representative
Mondell, majority leader of the house
agreed today. He and members of the
ways and means committee as well as
members of the senate finance commit
tee aie opposed to any general taxa
tion or tariff revision now.
A hard fight apparently is coming
on the recommendation for special tar
iffs on dyes and chemicals.
Repeal of the luxury taxes, much
talked of last session, appears unlike

Krie, Pa.. Dec. 3.—At a recent meet
ing of some twenty daily newspaper
publishers nf northwestern Pennsyl
vania at Corry it was unanimously
agreed that if the newspapers of this
section are to survive and maintain
their character a material Increase in
subscription and advertising rates Is
imperative and must be put into effect
very soon. The reason given for the
necessity of this action I» the high cost
of materials, and particularly print pa
The following statement was
adopted :
"The situation confronting the pub
lishers of this section, created by the
increasing coet of paper and all ma
terials, is such that in our judgment
an Immediate Increase In advertising
rates Is forced upon all publishers. We
have not the slightest disposition to
Join the profiteers, but we cannot pro
duce newspapers and maintain their
grade and character without receiving
for the service rendered a more nearly
adequate return than that afforded by
existing rates. We believe that the
public must and will recognize that
this course Is forced upon us and will
sustain us In It."

Unless Relief Comes From
the Eastern Fields.

which prevailed ■ throughout a large
part of the middle west today brought

This situation is typical of the ma
jority of the cities of the middle west,

United Press.
Railroads of the southwest were re
ported especially hard hit. Practically
all railroads have cut their schedules
to a minimum and unless relief is re
cclved immediately, no trains can he

Washington. Dec. 3.—Suggestions
were made today to Senator Cummins.
In charge of the railroad bill that he
ask for cloture on that measure. Cum
mins asked that no move be made for
a few days. The expectation was, how
ever, that should extended debate ap
pear likely, the cloture petition would
ne circulated and an attempt made to
repeal the action taken during the last
hours of the extra session when the
peace treaty was up.
This move le aimed at what is be
lieved to be a plan of eeveral senators
to talk Indefinitely on the railroad bill
b<cause of the anti-strike provision It
contains.
Republican leaders are trying to get
the bill through by Christmas, as the
president Is expected to return the

New Mexico Solon Charges Mexican Embassy in Washington,
Consul Generals in New York and San Francisco and the
Agents Along Border Stirring Up Revolution and Bolshevik
Ideals at the Instigation of President Carranza.
Washington, Dec. 3.—A concurrent resolution direoting
President Wilson to sever all diplomatic relations with Mexico
immediately and withdraw this government's recognition of
Carranza was introduced today in the senate by Senator Fall,
New Mexico.
Fall's resolution also would put congress on reoord as
backing up the state department's action in the Jenkins case.
The resolution was referred to the foreign relations com*
mittee.
Fall declared that evidence had been obtained that will
astound the country when it is produced.
MAKES STARTLING CHARGES.
"I charge that the Mexican embassy in Washington, the
Mexican consul generals in New York and San Francisco and
consuls along the border are constantly stirring up revolution
and Bolsheviki ideals,'' Fall declared. "Carranza is behind
this propaganda." igl
Senator Shields declared that a resolution by Senator
Ashurst, directing the war department to send troops to the
border did not go far enough and that it should be changed to
declare war on Mexico.
"For the last five years there has been ample cause
us to go to war," Shields said. *
Senator Fall's special Mexico Investi
gating committee is ready to report
at any time on the advisability of
armed intervention by the United
States, committee members said to
day.
Kali, just back from the border, had
r. long conference with Secretary l.an
sing. Fall said later his committee
can make a partial report at any time
for the information of congress, should
it be needed, although much investi
gating remains to be done.
Meanwhile Mexico had not replied to
latnsings second note, requesting re
lease of William O. Jenkins. American
consular agent imprisoned at Puebla.
Another refusal to free Jenkins would
not surprise the state department, it
vas learned. Such a refusal. It Is ex

Acting Foreign Minister for Southern Republic in Interview
With United Press Declares His Country Has NotDhanged
Its Attitude—Admits Relations Delicate but Asserts Not
So Critical as to Cause Break for Present.
Mexico City. Dec. 3.—The Mexican
government has not changed Its atti
tude in the Jenkins' case.
This declaration was made today by
Hilarlo Medina, acting foreign minis
ter In an exclusive interview with the
United Press.
''Mexico's position is the same today
as atated in Its recent note to the
United States," said Medina. 'We
outlined the facts then, and they are
unchanged. It Is true relations ars
delicate, but they are not so critical
as to cause a break. I do not think
they are beyond the possibility of an
amicable settlement."
MUST RESERVE OPINION.
Medina said he must reserve opinion
regarding the latest American note
(which reiterated that William O.
Jenkins, American consular agent,
must be released from the Puebla
Jail). He could not Indicate Mexico's
reply, he said, because It would only
follow the carefullest deliberation—but
he expressed the belief that the Amer
ican government was misinformed re
garding the circumstances of the Jen
kins' case and misunderstood Mexico's
position.
The mlnletef said he wished to
make plain that the Mexican govern
ment Is not accusing Consular Agent
Jenklne, but that the case was one
instituted In the local courte at Puebla
and that the decision rested with them.
TO SUPREME COURT.
Relative to the contention that the
case belonged to the federal court Me
dina said there waa a possibility It

uor was expected to present to Secre
tary j.ansing today the evidence sup
plied by the Mexican government to
support the charge of perjury against
Jenkins. This evidence was forward
ed to Bonillas by Hllario Medina act
ing minister of foreign affairs of Mex
ico, according to reports from Mexico
City.
Information reached Washington to
day of the kidnaping of Norman Rowe,
a British subject, by rebels at Zacate
cas. who held him for ransom. The
British vice consul at Zacatecas Imme
diately protested and reported the ab
duction to the British consul general
at Mexico City. The government at
once effected Rowe's release.
It is held by many here that British
subjects are accorded far better treat
ment by the Mexican government than
! Americans, due principally to the fact
that Great Britain has not recognized
