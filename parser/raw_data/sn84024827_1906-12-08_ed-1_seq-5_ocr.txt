holding down 160 acres near this
place, wandered from her shanty re
cently at night, in search of Miss Bab

clad only In a light house dress and
Bllppers. and finally reached the ranch
of A. L. Watklns. some two and a half
miles from her home, early the next
morning. When Miss Babcock re
turned to the shanty and found' Miss
Wllkins had wandered Into the sand
hills, she notified the authorities In
this town and a posse of, searchers was
organized at once. All nlgbt long the
posse searched the sandhills, calling
out to the lost woman. She. how
ever, reached the ranch a short time
ahead of her would-be rescuers, who
tracked her through the sand. Miss
Wllkins laughed at ber adventure, and
said It amounted to nothing.
The two young women are holding
down adjoining claims, doing all their
own work and making the Improve

plucky girls and have made themselves

London. Dec. 7. It became knows
recently that there Is no longer any
possibility of even a formal reconcilia

duchess of Marlborough, and the duke,
and that she has Instructed her attor
neys to prepare papers Immediately in
a suit for divorce. While there Is no
longer any question as to the divorce
being the outcome of the marriage,
there was still some doubt concerning
tho best locality in which to start the
proceedings. It Is the general belief
that the duchess will return to Amer.
Ica to get a divorce, where consider
able If not absolute secrecy could be
secured.
Two other plans have been consid
ered. One Is for the duchess to go to
Florence, Italy, and establish a resi
dence there, or even to go to Paris,
where she is very well known, and
begin a closet proceeding there with
out jnibllclty..
It can be said positively that William

who Is now In Paris, has given the

Consuelo's release without the scan

CALIFORNIA'S
JAPANESE PROBLEM
Rayner Asks That President In
form Mikado California Is
Within Her Rights,
'' ',-: f
i i j
WASHINGTON. D. C.. Dec. 7.
There Is great interest here In tho
Japanese' problem arising lnSan Fran
cisco. Senator Rayner of Maryland
has Introduced in the upper house ot
congress the following resolutions:
"Resolved, That In the opinion of
the Senate this government has no
right to enter Into any controversy
wlth any foreign government relating
to the public school system of any of
the states In the Union:
"Resolved, Further, that It Is the
opinion of the Senate that there is no
provision In the treaty between the
United States and the government of
Japan that relates In any manner to
this subject or in any way Interferes
with the rights of the State of Cali
fornia to conduct and administer Its
system of public schools In accord
ance with its own legislation; and
"Resolved, Further, that It Is the
duty of the president of the United
States to notify the government of Ja
pan and to notify any foreign govern
ment with which the question may
arise that the public educational Insti
tutions of the state are not within tho
Jurlsdlclon of tho United States and
the United States has no powerVo reg
ulate or supervise their administra
tion." President Roosevelt's discussion of
the San Francisco school situation In
his message was received with great
dissatisfaction by the California dele
gation in the house. The members
of the delegation from that state are
unanimous in their declaration that no
treaty rights have been violated in ex
cluding Japanese from public schools
attended by white children.
The suggestion in the president's
message that naturalization be extend
ed to Japanese is likewise extremely
distasteful to the California delega
tion in the house.
It is expected by the officials here
that a judicial determination of the
rights of the Japanese in California to
enjoy school privileges on like terms
with white children will be secured
through the institution ot a suit in San
Francisco before a federal court. The
action will be brought by an Individ
ual and will probably take the form
ot an application for an injunction di
rected to the school board enjoining
the board from denying Japanese chi'
dren from entrance to the public
schools so long as those privileges are
conceded to children of other nation
alities. The department ot justice
win. It is expected, be represented in
the proceeding.
