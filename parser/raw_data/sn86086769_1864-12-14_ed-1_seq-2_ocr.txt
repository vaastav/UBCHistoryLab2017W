President's message.
The Message of President Eineoln which
we publish in oar present issue -will he
road with interest by every op.* who feels
a desire to le.arn the condition of our pub
lic affairs. The Message -is short and
•omprehensire. Vow won and have ex
pressed so much :;i po few words. We
bo ieve the 'lessagc will please all classes
>ho ly desire the perpetuity of our
iiovernvrent. Du y appreciating the ( pin
ion* of t.ie overw Ueiming majority of free
men. as expressed at the ballot box, the
President indicates his purpose to pursue
firmly h:s official duty in suppressing the
rebellion and restoring peace and cp:i 't to
Our country. i ftcreis no comnromlse with
traitors and rebels. Whenever those who
have taken up the sword again-: the au
thority of the (Jovornment are ready to
lay it down and submit to the Constitution
And laws of the 1.-tn I. then —and not till
then —v. ill peace be restored. Jhe Presi
dent believes, as does every loyal man,
that a vigorous prosecution of the war is
Ihe ordy way to obtain peace.
Upon the great subject of domestic sla
y*ry, the message is plain and unequivo
cal. The President retracts nothing (V >m

caused a losing of the inter oceanic transit

that there is a good prospect that the route

It is possible that if it were anew an3
an open question, the maritime powers,
with the liirht they now enjoy, would not
concede the pri\ ilexes of a naval bellig
erent to the insurgents of the United
States, destitute, as they are and always
have been, equally of siiips and of ports
and harbors. Disloval emissaries have
been neither less assiduous nor morn sue
cesstiil during the last war than they
were before that time in their efforts, un
der favor of that privi ege, to embrei our
country in foreign wars. Nevcrtho css,
unforeseen political difficulties have aris
en. especially in Brazilian and British
ports, and on the North-rn boundary o!
the United State*, which have required
and are likely to continue to require, the
practice of constant vigi ance and a just
and conciliatory spirit on the part ol the
United States, as well as of the nations
concerned and of their governments.

Changes from the State system to the Na
tional system are rapidly taking place, and
it e- hoped that verv soon there wil be in
the United States no bank of issue not au
thorized hy f*ongress, and no bank note
circulation notsecured by tlie Government.
That the Government and the people will
derive general benefit from this change in
the banking systems of the country, can
hardly i'C questioned, The Nation-'. s- s
iem will create a reliable and permanent
influence in support of the national iredir,
i and protect the people against losses in
; the use of paper money. Whether or not
; anv further legislation is advisable for the
I suppression of the State Hank issues, if

Not a ithstanding tlie embarrass

prices of materials and labor, the route of

Sacramento eastward to the great bend of

Namsroni discoveries <*f gold, siher nd
cinnibar mines have been added to the |
many heretofore known, and the country !
occupied by the Sierra Nevada and Uocky '
Mountains and the subordinate ranges, '
now teems with enterprising labor, which i
is richly remunerative. It is believed that |
the products of the mines of precious met
al* in that region has, during the year
reached, if not exceeded, $lO9 030,00*0 in
value.
It whs recommended in my last annual
message that our Indian system be re
mo le ed. Congress, at its last session,
acting on the recommendation, did pro
vide for reorganizing the system in Cali
fornia, and it is believed that under the
present organization the management of
the Indians there will 1m attended with
reasonab e success. Much yet remains
to be done to provide lor the proper gov-
I eminent <>f the Indians in other parts o r
the eountrv, to render it secure f<*r the
advancing settler, and to pro ido for the
welfare of the Indian. The Secretary re
iterates lus reeommen latinos, an I to tliem
the attention of Congress is invited.

The Agricultural Depar'ment, under
the supervision of its present energetic
head, is rapidly commending itself to the
great and vital interest it was created to
advance. it is peculiarly' the people's de
pirtment, in width they fee more direct
ly concerned than in nnv other I com
mend it to the continued attention and
fostering care of Congress.
The war continues. Since the last an
nua! message, all the important line- and
positions then held hv our armies have
been maintained, and our armi-.s have
stcadi y advanced, thus liberating the
States left in the rea~, so that Mi-soiiri.
Kentucky, Tennessee, and parts of other
Sr >tes. have again produced reasonably
fair crops.
The most remarkable feature in the
military operations of ihe rear is General
SiiermaiT.s'attcmptcd march of three Inin
dred miles directly through the insurgent
region. It tends to show a great increas•
of our relative strength, that our Genoral
in-( 'hief shou and feel able to c nfront and
bold in cheek e t-rv aeti e force of the
enemy, and yet to detach a well appoute 1
army to move on such an expedition. The
result not yet being known, conjecture in
regard to it is not here indulged.
Important movements have also occur
red if 1 ring the year, to the effect of m- aid
ing society for dural ility in tlie Union
Although short of complete success, it is
much in the right direction that 19 Out
citizens in each of the states of Arkansas
and Loni-iana have organized loyal State
Governments with free constitutions, and
are ?arnestlv struggling to maintain and
administer them 'The movement in the
same direction, more extensive, though
1 ss definite, in Missouri. Kentucky and
I -nnessee. should not be overlooked : but

is onlv a question of time as to when the

now for the first time heard on the ques

unanimity of action amont those seeking
a common end is very desirable, almost
indispensihle. and vet no approach tosndi

majority. In this case the common en I
is the maintenance of the Union, and
among the means to secure that end. such
wiP, through the election, is most clearly
declared in favor of such constitutional
amendment. The most reliable indication
of public purpose in this country is derived
through our popn ar e’e lion.
Judging by the recent canvass and its
results, the purpose of the people within
the loyal States to maintain the integrity
of the 1 nion \.as never more firm nor

extraordinarv calmness and good order
with wbi -h the mil ions of • ot *rs met and

fairly chi lined to be actuated bv the same
purpose. It is an unanswerable argument

opportunity ofshowing one to another, an 1

of purpose, the c ection ha* been of vast I

• The election has exhibited another fact not
Uss valuable to be known—the fact that we
do not approach exhaustion in the most im
portant branch of the national resources
that of living men While it is melancholy
to reflect that the war has tilled so many
graves and eansed mourning to so many homes
it ; s some relief to know that, compared with
the surviving, the fallen have be m so tew.—
While corps and divisions and In igades and
regiments have formed and fought and bled,
and gone out of existence, a groat majority of
the men who composed them are still living.
The s line tin-- of the naval service; the
election returns prove this. So many voters
could not else be found. The States regularly

■ uid negatively, by tiie election. It is not
material to inquire ho.v the increase has been
I produced, or to show that it would have been
I greater but for the w ar, which is probably
true. The important fact remains demons! si
ted that we have more men now than we had
wlie.t the vr-r bega - —tliat we are not ex

■ lie purpose to re-establish and maintain the
national authority is unchanged, and, ~s we
believe, unclianjwablc. The manner of eon
tinning the eilbrt remains to choose. On
careful consideration of all the evidence a
- it seems to me that in> attempt at
negotiation with the insurgent leader could

Img short of the 8 veranc<“ of the Union. Ills
j doelaralion ' to tint "IT-vt are explicit and
oft-repositml. He iloes not attempt todeeeivt

be fried bv war aid decided l>v victory. If
we yield, we are beaten. If the Southern

After x► much, the (J 'vermyfiit could not, il
i it would, maintain war against them. The
| loyal people w mid not sustain or allow it. Il
| questions should remain, we would adjust
j them by the peaceful means of legislation,
! conference, courts ami votes, operating onlv
;in Constitutional and lawful channels. Some
certain and other possible questions are and
would be bevoud the Executive power to ;;d
--just. Forinstanee, the admission ofinetnb?is
into Congress, and whatever might require
.he appropriation of money. The Executive
power itself would he greatlyy diminished hv
the cessation of act .il wsiv Uardons and
remissions of forfeitures, woviUT still 1..- within
Executive control. In what sp r t and t nip. r
this control would he cxerci-td, can lie f.iiilv
judged of by tit*' past. A year ago Gt ncrni

were olfeted to all except a certain and sigoatt and
class, a;nl it was at the s nne time lu ole known
Jiat the excepted classes were stil within
