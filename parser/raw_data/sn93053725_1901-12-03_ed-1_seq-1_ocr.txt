Many senators, close friends

SHIPPED AS FREIGHT.
ilaa -Forwarded from Germany in a
Box.
NEW-YORK, Dec. ?. When" a long,
shoreman dropped into the hold of the
steamer Palatia of the Hamburg
American line, just arrived at the Ho
token docks, he was startled to hear a
weak voice call for water. Then he
lteard moans. Summoning assistance,
ba made a search and came across the
form of a man lying across some salt
tacks. The man was dragged to the
deck and became unconscious and is
tiow at a Hoboken hospital, with litllfc
chance of recovery or, indeed, of evet
telling LLj strange tale. He is suffer
ing from starvation.
A detailed investigation shows that
the stranger had been boxed up in
Germany in a packing case marked
J. 3.. 71""-'. In the case was a small
bottle which' had contained whisky and
also some crumbs of bread. A piece ot
paper was found marked "John Beck."

Mr Roosevelt's Recommendations on
Many Subjects.
Washington, Dec 3 The president in
his annual message to congress says:
The congress assembles this year un
der the shadow of a great calamity.
On the 6th of September President Mc
Kinley was shot by an anarchist while
attending the Pan-American exposi
tion at Buffalo and died in that city
on the 14th of that month.
Of the last seven elected presidents
he is the third who has been murdered,
and the bare recital of this fact is
sufficient to justify grave alarm among
all loyal American citizens. Moreover,
the circumstances of this, the third as
sassination of an American president,
have a peculiarly sinister significance.
Both President Lincoln and President
Garfield were killed by assassins of
types unfortunately not uncommon in
history, President Lincoln falling a
victim to the terrible passions aroused
by four years of civil war and Presi
dent Garfield to the revengeful vanity
of a disappointed office seeker. Presi
dent McKinley was killed by an utter
ly depraved criminal belonging to that
body of criminals who object to all
governments, good and bad alike, who
are against any form of popular lib
erty if it is guaranteed by even the
most just and liberal laws and who
are as hostile to the upright exponent
of a free people's sober will as to the
tyrannical and irresponsible despot.
Anarchy and Anarchists.
The president' continues with a
eulogy of Mr. McKinley, then turns to
the subject of anarchy, denouncing its
doctrine and preachers. He says:
I earnestly recommend to the congress
that in the exercise of its wise discre
tion it should take into consideration
the coming to this country of anarch
ists or persons professing principles
hostile to all government and justify
ing the murder of those placed in au
thority. Such individuals as those who
not long ago gathered in open meeting
to glorify the murder of King Hum
bert of Italy perpetrate a crime, and
the law should insure their rigorous
punishment. They and those like them
should be kept out of this country, and
if found here they should be promptly
deported ' to the country whence they
came, and farreaching provision should
be made for the punishment of those
who stay. No matter call? more
urgently for the' wisest thought of the
congress.
A Subject For Federal Courts.
The-federal courts should be given
jurisdiction over any man who kills
or attempts to kill the president or any
man who by the constitution or by
law. is in line pf succession for the
presidency, while the punishment for
an unsuccessful attempt should be pro
portioned to the enormity of the of
fense against our institutions.
Anarchy Js "a crime against the whole
human race, and all mankind should
band against the anarchist.
The president next considers busi
ness conditions, which he finds highly
satisfactory. He continues:
The tremendous and highly complex
industrial development which went on
with ever accelerated rapidity during
the latter half of. the nineteenth cen.
tury brings us face to face at the be.
ginning of the twentieth with very
serious social problems. The old laws
uir holes in the case, and the man must
have existed on what came through the
joining of the boards. The hatch to
this hold had not been opened from the
time the Palatia left port until yester
cay. It is the opinion of the investi
gators -that during the last of the trip
the stowaway became so frenzied that
he broke out of the box, and there was
to way for him to give the alarm.
The men was well dressed, evidently
a German about thirty years old. Cp
to the present the consignor or con
signee of the case has not been discov
ered. . .Yesterday au American Express
wagon called for a box marked as this
one was, and it is believed that through
this circumstance something more may
t-e learned of the strange affair.

side up, with care." There were ik and the old custora3 whicn had almost
the binding force of law were once
quite sufficient to regulate the ac
cumulation and distribution of wealth.
Since the industrial changes which
have so enormously increased the pro
ductive power of mankind they are no
longer sufficient
The growth of cities has gone on be
yond comparison faster than the
growth of the country, and the up
building of the great industrial centers
has meant a startling increase not
merely in the aggregate of wealth, but
in the number of very large individual
and especially of very large corporate
fortunes. The creation of these great
corporate fortunes has not been due
to the tariff nor to any other govern
mental action, but to natural causes
in the business world, operating in oth
er countries as In our own.
The .process has aroused' much an
tagonism, a, great part of which is
wholly without warrant. It Is not true
that as the rich have grown richer the
poor have grown poorer. On the con
trary, never .before has the average
man, the wageworker, the farmer, the
small trader, been so well off as in this
country and at the present time. There
have been abuse connected with the
accumulation of wealth, yet it remains
true that a fortune accumulated Id
legitimate business can be aecuinuiav
ed by the person specially benefited
only on condition of conferring im
mense incidental benefits upon oth
ers. Successful enterprise of the type
which benefits all mankind can only
exist if the conditions are such as to
offer great prizes as the rewards of
success. v
Reason For Caution.
The president adds that there are
many reasons for caution in dealing
with corporations. He says:
The same business conditions which
have produced the great aggregations
of corporate and individual wealth
have made them very potent factors in
international commercial competition.
Moreover, it cannot too often be
pointed out that to strike with ignorant
violence at the Interests of one set of
men almost inevitably endangers the
interests of all. The fundamental rule
in our national life the rule which un
derlies all others is'that, on the whole
and in the long run, we shall go up or
down together.
The mechanism of modern business
is so delicate that extreme care must
be taken not to interfere with it in
a spirit of rashness or Ignoranee. In
dealing with business interests, for
the government to undertake by crude
and ill considered legislation to do
what may turn out to be bad, would
be to incur the risk of such f arreach
tag national disaster that it wpuld be
Tried Before Vnlted States
Xaval Court at Tutulla.
AUCKLAND, New Zealand. Dec. 3.
The United States naval court at Tu
tulla, Samoa, has honorably acquitted
Captain Benjamin F. Tilley, the naval
governor of Tutuila, of all the charges
against him. No evidence to sustain
these charges was presented to the
court.
Commander Uriel Sebree has suc
ceeded Captain Tilley as naval govern
or of Tutuila.
The charges against Captain Tilley
arose from certain allegations made by
missionaries in Samoa against the cap

preferable to undertake nothing at all.
The men who demand the impossible
or the undesirable serve as the allies
of the forces with which they are nom
inally at war, for they hamper those
who would endeavor to find out in ra
tional fashion what the wrongs really
are and to what extent and in what
manner it is practicable to apply. reme
dies. "
How to Correct tlie Evils.
All this is true, and yet it is also
true that there are real and grave evils,
one of the chief being overcapitaliza
tion because of its many baleful con
sequences, and a resolute and practical
effort must be made to correct these
evils.
It is no limitation upon property
rights or freedom of contract to re
quire that when men receive from gov
ernment the privilege of doing busi
ness under corporate form, which frees
them from individual responsibility
and enables them to call into their en
terprises the capital of the public, they
shall do so upon absolutely truthful
representations as to the value of the
property In which the capital is to be
invested. Corporations engaged in in
terstate commerce should be regulated
if they are found to exercise a license
working to the public injury. It should
be as much the aim of those who" seek
for social betterment to rid the busi
ness world of crimes of cunning as to
rid the entire body politic of crimes of
violence. Great corporations exist only
because they are created and -safeguarded
by our institutions, and it is
therefore our right and our duty to
see that they work in harmony with
these institutions. -
Publicity tlie First Essential.
The first essential in determining
how to deal with the great industrial
combinations is knowledge of the facts
publicity. In the interest of the pub
lic the government should have the
right to inspect and examine the work
ings of the great corporations engaged
in interstate business. Publicity is the
only sure remedy which we can now
invoke. What further remedies are
needed in the way of governmental
regulation or taxation can only be de
termined after publicity has been ob
tained by process of law and in the
course of administration. The first
requisite is knowledge, full and com
pleteknowledge which may be made
public to the world.
Artificial bodies, such as corporations
and joint stock or other associations,
depending upon any statutory law for
their existence or privileges should be
subject to proper governmental super
vision, and full and accurate informa
tion as to their operations should be
made public, regularly at reasonable
intervals.
The large corporations, commonly
called trusts, though organized in one
state, always do business in many
states, often doing very little business
in the state where they are ineorpo
rated. There is utter lack of uniform
ity in the state laws about them, and,
as no state has any exclusive interest
in or power over their acts, it has in
practice proved impossible to get ade
quate" regulation through state action.
Therefore, in the Interest of the whole
people, the nation should, without in
terfering with the power of the states
in the matter itself, also assume power
of supervision and regulation over all
corporations doing an interstate busi
ness. .
When the constitution was adopted,
at the end of the eighteenth century,
no human wisdom could foretell the
sweeping changes, alike in industrial
and political conditions, which were to
take place by the beginning of the
twentieth century. At that time it
was accepted as a matter of course
that the several states were the proper
authorities to regulate, so far as was
then necessary, the comparatively in
significant and strictly localized cor
porate bodies of the day.' The condi
tions are now wholly different, and
wholly different action is called for.
I believe that a law can be framed
which will enable the national govern
ment to exercise control along the lines
above indicated, profiting by the expe
rience gained through the passage and
administration of the interstate com
merce act. If, however, the judgment
of the congress is that it lacks the con
stitutional power to pass such an act,
then a constitutional amendment
should be submitted to confer the
power.
There should be created a cabinet of
ficer, to be known as secretary of
commerce and industries, as. provided
m the bill introduced at the last ses
sion of the congress. It should be his
province to deal with commerce in its
broadest sense, including among many
other things whatever concerns labor
and all matters affecting the great
business corporations and our mer
chant marine. s
Labor,
The president declares that he re
gards It necessary to re-enact the Chi
nese exclusion law. - In regard to labor
he says that the government should
provide in Its contracts that all work
should be done under "fair" conditions
and that all night work should be for
bidden for women and children as well
as excessive overtime. He continues:
Very great good has been and will be
accomplished by associations or unions
of wageworkers when managed with
forethought and when they combine in
sistence upon their own rights with
law abiding respect for the rights of
others. The display of these qualities
in such bodies is a duty to the nation
no less than to the associations them
selves. Finally, there must also in
many cases be action by the govern
ment in order to safeguard the rights
and interests of all. Under' our consti
tution there is much more scope for
such action by the state and the munic
ipality than by the nation. But on
points such as those touched on above
the national government can act.
He asserts that the Immigration laws
are unsatisfactory and that a law
should be enacted tol:eep out not only
anarchists, but persons of a low moral
tendency or or -unsavory reputation
and those who are below a certain
standard of economic -fitness ,to enter
our industrial field as competitors with
American labor.
The Tariff and Keelnroeity.
The president declares that nothing
could be more unwise than to disturb
the business interests of the country by
any general tariff change at this time.
He adds:
Yet it is not only possible, but emi
nently desirable, to combine with the
stability of our economic system a sup
plementary system of reciprocal bene
fit and obligation with other nations.
Such reciprocity is an incident and re
sult of the firm establishment and
preservation of our present economic
policy. It was specially provided for
in the present tariff law.
Reciprocity must be treated as the
handmaiden of, protection. Our first
duty is to see that the protection grant
ed by the tariff in every case where it
is needed is maintained, and that reci
procity be sought for so far as it can
safely be done without injury to our
home industries. Just how far this is
must be determined according to the
individual case, remembering always
that every application of our tariff pol
icy to meet our shifting national needs
must be conditioned; upon the cardinal
fact that the duties must never be
reduced below the point that will cover
the difference between the labor cost
here and, abroad. The well being of
the wageworker is a' prime considera
tion of our entire policy of economic
legislation.
Seed For Wider Markets.
Subject to this proviso of the proper
protection necessary to our industrial
well being-at home, the principle of
reciprocity must command .our. -hearty
support. The phenomenal .growth of
our export trade emphasizes the ur
gency of '.the need tor wider markets
aud for a liberal policy in dealing with
foreign nations. Whatever is merely
1 petty and vexatious in the way of
trade restrictions should be avoided.
-The customers to whom, we dispose of
our surplus products in the long run,
directly or indirectly, purchase those
surplus products by giving us some
thing in return.' Their ability to pur
chase our products should as far as
possible be secured; by so arranging
our tariff as to enable us to take from
them those products which we can use
without harm to our own industries
and labor or the use of which will be
of marked benefit to us.
It is most important that we should
maintain the high level of our present
prosperity. We have now reached the
point in the development of our in
terests where we are not only able to
supply our own markets, , but to pro
duce a constantly growing surplus for
which we must find, markets abroad.
To secure these markets we can util
ize existing duties' in any case where
they are no longer needed, for the pur
pose of protection, or in . any case
where the article is not produced here
and the duty is no longer necessary
for revenue, as giving us something to
offer in exchange for what we ask.
The cordial relations with other na
tions which are so desirable will nat
urally be promoted by the course thus
required by our own. interests. .
The natural line olLdevelopment for a
policy of reciprocity will be in connec
tion with those of our productions
which no longer require all of the sup
port once needed to establish them
upon a sound basis and with those oth
ers where either because of natural or
of economic causes we are beyond the
reach of successful competition.
I ask the attention of the senate to
the reciprocity treaties laid before it by
my predecessor.
The Merchant Marine.
The condition of the American mer
chant marine is such as to call for im
mediate remedial action by the con
gress. It is discreditable to us as a
nation that our merchant marine
should be utterly insignificant in com
parison to that of other nations which
we overtop in other forms of busiuess.
We should not longer submit to condi
tions under which only a trifling por
tion of our great commerce is carried
In our own ships: To remedy this state
of things would not merely serve to
build up our shipping interests, but it
would also result in benefit to all who
are interested in the permanent estab
lishment of a wider market for Amer
ican products and would provide an
auxiliary force for the navy. Ships
wrork for their own countries just as
railroads work for their terminal
points. Shipping lines, if established to
the principal countries with which we
have de? lings, would be of political as
well as commercial benefit. From ev
ery standpoint it" is unwise for the
United Si-'., o continue to relyupon
the ships ipeting nations for the
distribution v, our goods. It should be
made advantageous to carry American
goods in American built ships.
At present American shipping is un
der certain great disadvantages when
put in coinpetitisa with the shipping
of foreign countries. Many of the fast
foreign steamships, at a speed of four
teen knots or above, are subsidized,
and all our ships, sailing vessels and
steamers alike, cargo carriers of slow
speed and mail carriers of high speed,
have to meet the fact that the original
cost of building- American ships is
greater than is the case abroad; that the
wages paid American officers and sea
men are very much higher than those
paid the officers and seamen of foreign
competing countries, aud that the
standard of living on our ships is far
superior to the standard of living on
the ships of our commercial rivals. Our
government should take such action as
will remedy these inequalities. The
American merchant marine should be
restored to the ocean.
Financial.
The passage of the act establishing
jrold as the standard money has, it is
declared, been shown to be timely and
judicious. The president adds:

FOUGHT WITH PISTOLS.
Highwayman Held up Dr Zeigler Bul
let went Through Nine 1,000 Bills.
Chicago, Dec 3. A lono highwayman
and Dr L. C. II. E. Zeigler fought with
pistols last night on the prairie west
of Garfield park, for Ifte possession of
$9,000. One bullet ; flattened itself
against the doctor's watch, just over
his heart, and a second passed through
his silk hat and tore its way through
the nine Sl.OOO bills that were hidden
there in an envelope. The professor
believes one of his bullets struck his
assailant in the hand and the police
are searching for a wounded man.
Some weeks ago Prof Zeigler adver
tised for 400 cadavers, to be used for
purposes of ' demonstrating at the
schools . of. osteopathy iu Illinois and
other states. He announced in his ad
vertisement that he was willing to
spend $21,000 for' the number of ca
davers he required, and the police be
lieve it was the publication of these
figures that led up to last nigBfs as

hold-up to have been the outcome of
a conspiracy, one of the phases cf
which was a confidence game, whereby
Dr Zeigler Ayas entrapped in carrying
$U,000 in cash on his person.

A DANGEROUS BOY.
Threatened to Shoot Neigh bor Sen t
to Reform School.
- Huntington, Dec 3. Upon request of
his parents,. Frederick BoutelUer, a
bright boy of 11 years, has been com
mitted to the State School for Boys.
: The immediate cause of the action
was. the boy's recent threat to shoot
Theodore Beard, a neighbor of the
family. v Mr Beard admonished the boy
for some prank or other and the boy,
providing himself with a gun, threat
ened to kill the man '"unless he kept
his mouth shut."
The father of the precocious young
ster applied" to the selectmen of Hunt
ington and was advised- to hiing rlie
matter to the attention of Judge Cur
tis. This was done wffa the result
that the boy was sent to the School for
Boys. ; -. .
It has since been learned that this is
not-the only instance of the boy's ex
traordinary proclivities. Not long ago,
according to informal m placed before
the authorities, the boy took exception
to admonishment given by his father.
The next morning he put corrosive sub
limate in the' breakfast coffee. A
brother started to drink some of the
coffee. when he was warned by Freder
ick not to touch it, adding: "I fixed it
for father."
The father was warned in turn by
the brother and .it was then loaruod
that young Frederick had used the
poison mentioned above.

been engaged by Judge Cowell to takt
this matter to the courts. In the air
ternoon it leaked out that the confer
ence of the few republicans above. re
f erred to had resulted in an agreement
to take the matter to the publicity of
the courts. V
A ' republican ' whose name would
brand any statement from him a the
acme of voracity said this morning
that the parties behind the moiioii
to protest against the' will of the peo
ple are three well known and intia
ential men in the community. -Thin
prominent republican said Judge Cow
ell was not back of the. mot ion at all.
"He does not want to be mayor," con
tinued this man. "nor did he care to
be mayor when he accepted the nomin
ation, so if he is brought into this mat
ter it will be unwillingly on his part.'
When talk of the election was first
heard it was said that the republicans
had all the law on their side, but opin
ion is divjded now and many lawyers
of well known ability say no court will
turn down tlie people in a matter ia
which they were so emphatic as in the
late election.
The petition was almost completed
at 3:30 o'clock and simple as the law.
yers engaged on it say it is, it never
theless occupies three or four pages of
legal cap. Briefly, it states that tlie
petitioner is George II. Cowell, a resi
dent of the city, etc. and candidate
for mayor in the election disputed;
that he is entitled to the office of may
or by reason of certain ballots cast in
the third and fourth wards being il
legal; that he wants a recount of the
ballots, etc. '
Colonel Burpee was asked what tha
illegality was in the fourth ward bal
lots and he replied that he was not
ready to state at present. He was so
busy with the matter that he bad no
time to speak further.
The motive behind the- petition I
said to be to avert the threatened high
taxation that was brought about by
iieprenentative Lilley's unique system
of consolidation. - - - :
The republicans this afternoon set
in operation the machinery of. the laAV
by which they expect to thwart tb?
will of the people as expressed in the
October election for the continuation
of the democratic administration.
Though prominent republicans from
time to time during the past few weeks
were quoted in the press as denying
that any effort Avould be made or even
was thought of iu protesting the elec
tion, it was not supposed for a moment
by sensible ieople that the republicans
would accept the will of the election
if they could by any moans throw it
aside. Not later than yesterday morn
ing Colonel Burpee, one of the mo
prominent in his party, and iu a quiet
way the most influential, was quoted
as saying that it was all nonsense this
talk about protesting the election. Yet

in this matter. Aud Deputy Judge
Peasley is his assistant, the latter also,
it is said, saying the republicans had
iio case. -
The situation at noon appeared to
give Colonel Burpee the part of the
thinker of the plot and Judge Peasley
the role of worker. At all events the
former was very happy in appearance
while the latter was red in the face
with work. He said that the motion
which was to be presented to the' court
was not then ready, but would be as
soon as possible. Colonel Burpee said
that to-day, possibly this afternoon,
formal notice of a motion to have the
ballot boxes opened would be left with
Clerk Marsh of the superior court, as
that was all that was necessary for the
present and to-morrow he would apply
for a hearing on his motion.-
This matter was not wholly a sur

candidate for the, mayoralty, was in
Colonel Burpee's office for an hour or
so. , He said his presence was con
nected with -a case he ha d. Subse
quently Colonel Burpee denied he had
