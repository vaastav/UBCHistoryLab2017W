of
MADRID, Dec. 8. (Special. )-The naval
demonstration planned against Morocco is
not because or the operations of brigand
chief like Roiaull, as has beon intimated,
but because of the attitude of that coun
try against the reforms which France and
Spain are trying to Introduce. Ka.eun
lilmaclf .has sent a letter boasting that he
will drive the new Fi anco-SpanUh pullve
out of every port from Tangier to Mo
gador If the aullan will let him.
It la even reported here that Moroccan
affalra will llgure prominently In the United
Stales congress this winter. Diplomats
bar aay that President Roosevelt Is dis
posed to turn the subject mutter over to
tho United States senate. The International
agreement entered Into at Algeclras pro
vides that final action must be repoi-ted
back by each country signatory to the
troaty of December 31. According to ad
vices received hero congress may be ex
pected to take lis vacation for the holi
days about December 30. and this will
leave only a few days for the discussion
and the final consideration of tho treaty.
Although Ann ilea's representatives In
the conference of last winter signed the I
treaty unly after the Inclusion of a special
paragraph relieving tho United States of
any responsibility, joint or otherwise, far
enforcing any of the provisions of the
agreement, there Is not entire unanimity of
' opinion aa to the advisability of the senate
yielding its adherence to the treaty.
Time for Action.
Borne months have now elapsed since the
representatives of the European powers,
by the signature of the Algeclras conven
tion, solemnly undertook not only to re
spect the "Integrity and, independence" of
the Bhereeflan empire, but also to provide
. for the policing of the coast towns and to
superintend the introduction of much
needed reforms in the finances and the gen
eral administration of that country. Since
the assent of the sultan to the Algeclraa
convention was duly notified some tlmo
ago It is time, the diplomats say, to look
for some practical outcome of the grave
and prolonged, deliberations and the defi
nite decisions of the International confer
ence. It must be confessed, however, that
no outward or visible sign of anything of
the kind is yet .discoverable. On the con
trary the situation in Morocco Is to all ap
pearances a good deal worse than It was
year . ago. It Is true that little has been
heard lately of the activities of the pre
tender, who seems to have had the worst
of It In his last trial of strength with the
ultan's troops. But the authority of tho
sultan himself, or rather of the handful of
magnates who profess to govern the coun
try In his name, has well nigh disappeared
everywhere except In Fes and Its Immedi
ate neighborhood. The hill tribes on the
northern , and western coasts have never
paid more than a nominal allegiance to the
central government, but whereas former
ultans were accustomed to remind them
by the primitive method of periodical mil
itary expeditions, which carried fire and
sword through the villages, no such disci
pline has been administered to them since
the beginning of the present reign. In
Tangier itself, the principal port and busi
ness capital of Morocco, all real power
seems to be In the hands of that enterpris
ing bandit, Ralsull. who Was rewarded a
year or two ago for kidnaping of Ameri
can and British subjects by the appoint
ment to the governorship of the surround
ing district, and whose authority even la
the city appears to overshadow that of the
Maghzen.

MISSIONARIES NOT PLEASED
Pessimistic tn the Tnnr at Report
nu Work of London
Society.
LONDON, Dec. s. 'Pped-ii.) Ths report
of the Iyindon Missionary society, Just out
for the year, c mtalns some piai-es which
nre decidedly pessimistic. Btlll there are
many passages of unusual Interest. The
Calcutta mission, according to the repo
has a girls' sc hool known ns "Dusky Dai
lings." One of the China ni'.-nlonarlcs,
Mr. Rrysnn, In the Ycnsan district, states
that the decline of Hnxerdom has produced
a general decay of Idolatrous worship
Mrs. Murray of the Ts.i Chow district of
China Is especially severe on the society
women, who some to the missionaries and
take tea, but who cannot keep up any con
versation. The .Maiairasay people are evi
dently very different from the p"ople In
lands more civilized, for thev are so fond
of preaching- that they walk miles and go
without food for hours to hear a pulpit
orator, but prayer meetings, on the other
hand, are reported to be very unpopular
even among this peculiar people.
"The Pilgrim's Progress" Is reported an
unappreciated classic among the Polynesia
Islanders and "hundreds of copies are lylnff
in the mission house worm-ca'on."
It uppears that the "Soap trust" is by
no means a modern Institution. Many stu
dents of history know that in the latter
part of the reign of Charles I a few soap
projector.! cornered the Industry of soap
making by persuading the revenue au
thorities to accept 11 present of $5aYin per
annum more than the former revenue on
soap, and by being appointed "searchers
for the ixcl.se," whereby they might harry
their weaker rivals, "divers persons of
mean condition selling rir.pp in many hv
eorners In and about Ixmdon and West
minster." A slashing pamphle: attacking
this trust In the fiercest terms was printed
In 1BI1, and quite recently the well known
bibliophile. Mr. Trcgaskis of High Hol
born. has discovered a copy of this rare
tract, no copy 1-eiiisr tracable In the Brit
ish museum or the Bodclian. The titlo of
this scarce document is "A looking Olasse

Olasse making discovery of a new
Project contrived and propounded by
the Sope Directors to tho Parliament, to
Monopolize the Soplng-Mystery under pre-
tenees of good to the State In the duty of

extra $5,010 per year revenue was to be
secured "without enhancing the usual
price to the subject."
PRINCE GEORGE TO BE BARRED
Heir Apparent to Servian Throne
Staid by Aaaoelatea to
lie Insane.
BELGRADE, Dec. . (Special.) A fresh
catastrophe threatens the present Servian
dynasty. The eldest eon of King Peter,
Crown Prince George, who la now 20
years of uge, according to ull accounts haa
become hopelebsly insane, and a plan U
now under way to permanently exclude
him from the succession und declare his
younger brother, Prince Alexander, who is
only is years old, the heir.
According to some of the accounts the
situation at the palace became so bad
that the two adjutants to Prince George
resigned their positions and other officers
refused to volunteer for the duty, though,
as a general thing, the post near the heir
apparent to the throne In any country la
considered one of the greatest honor. The
disinclination Is explained by the 111 treat
ment to which the adjutants of the prince
were subjected, they, aa well as his serv
ants, being addressed as Servian dogs and
otherwise abused. The imperfect eduoa-
j tlon of the crown prince, his courseness, his
, sudden fits of passion, hla detestation of
i work, his determination to do nothing at
I all besides the gratification of every kind
I of low Instinct of which he Is accused, suf
ficiently explain the hesitation of officers
to undertake the poat of personal aide-decamp.
In the short period of the reign of
the dynaaty of Karageorgevich since the
murder of King Alexander and Queen
Draga, Prince George has contracted what
for the Servian conditions are enormous
debts, owing to hla dissipated course of
life.

recall one of the most dreadful eviction ,
scenes in the whole history of Irish land-
lordism, which for Its pec
.llo.. .-riinltv nt- i
traded universal uttentlon. The beauty
of the scenery of Glenvclgn attracted tha
attention of John George Adair, a guecn's
county landlord, while on a sporting visit
to the locality, and he resolved to buy the
property. There were disagreements be
tween him and his tenants and finally one
of his herdsmen was murdered. Mr.
Adair a revenge was the banishment of the
whole population. Dublin castle even made
preparations for assisting him In this act
of brutal and wholesale tyrnnny, as ex
tensive a small campaign as was ever
planned. Mr. Adair's bailiffs were supplied
with the services of a large number of
soldiers and police. On Monday, April 8,
1I1, the work of eviction began, and the
inhabitants of the whole countryside were
turned adrift on the world, being expelled
from their liousea, which were leveled to
the ground. The poor, starving people re
mained on the bleak mountains and were
eventually sent to Australia by the efforts
of charitable friends.

Commons, take the decisive step In es
pousing the cause of the Irish people. When
at length a sufficient sum was collected,
largely through the exertions of Rev.
Jamea McFadden, then a young curate In
the district, for their departure to a new
land not held In bondage like their own,
the poor people were sought out and gath
ered together. Some by thia time had
sunk under their sufferings. One man named
Bradley had lost his reason under the
shock; other caaes were nearly as heart
rending. There were old men who would
keep wandering over tho ruins In view
of their ruined homes full of the Idea that
some day Mr. Adair might let them re
turn, but who at last had to be borne to
distant workhouses to die.
Town of Bray Damna-ed.
The meeting at BraV m furtherance of
a demand for 'a marine works act In the
Interest of the harbors on the oast and
south coasts had a very strong argument
placed before It by Us chair the other day,
Joseph W. Relgh. Bray's claim In con
nection with the movement Is for restitu
tion. A local expenditure of $325,000 haa
left the town with a harbor that Is prac
tically useless In connection with the fish
ing industry and a river that Is a danger
to the lives of the Inhabitants. The floods
of last year are remembered In this con
nection. But as Mr. Relgh showed, these
floods were the result of an Interference
which Parliament sanctioned with Bray
river. Formery the floods disported them
selves at will over the broad reach of Bray
commons. Then came the conntruction of
the railway and the enclosure of the Bray
commons lands, which were allowed to be
sequestered for the purpose of Improving
the waterways. The property of the peo
ple was sold, but instead of Improving the
river, the "Improvers" shut It up In ao nar
row a bed that In times of flood and high
tide the waters burst Into the houses of
the poor people. The report of Mr. Comber,
the engineer who has been consulted,
clearly shows that the works and plans
sanctioned by Parliament are the cause of
this dangerous condition of things. "As
long as the commons were commons and
waste land," reports Mr. Comber, "and
there were no houses or railways to in-
tercept the floods and prevent them from
dispearalng on the beach. It did not matter
very much. The railway embankment was

CAIRO, Dec. 8. (Special.) Interesting
letters have Just been received from Mr.
Hans Vlscher. British resident at Kuka.
Lake Chad, who ia now undertaking il
dangerous journey through the forbidden
hinterland of Tripoli, across the great
Sahara, to Lake Chad.
Describing his Journey Mr. Vlsclur
writes: "Until the members of the caravan
got to know each other there was a con
tinual trouble betwten Arabs ond natives.
Among my people were fourteen Mugrihl

BARONESS AS A FORGER
Woman Aeeuaed of Aiding; Band tn
Make False Certificates
of Stock.
PARIS, Dec. 8. (Special.) It Is not often
that a baroness appears In court on the
charge of hiring a sumptuous villa and di
recting a band of forgers to produce false
bank notes and clever Imitations of railway
B,,arM quoted on the parls Bour8e; yet u
happens that a personage of precisely this
type has appeared In court during the last
few days, accompanied by her "staff" of
coadjutors, of whom five were present dur
ing the trial. All of them have made pre
vious acquaintance with various courts
and jails In different countries.
In 1877 the Paris, Lyons & Mediterranean
railway had commissioned a Paris printer
to print a series of new 3 per cent shares,
but as the printing was not satisfactory
the company refused to accept them. They
were finally sold as waste paper and the
bundles eventually fell Into . the hands of
Victor Lankmann, a Belgian, who was
sentenced for forgery to six years' Im
prisonment and expelled from France ten
years ago. Last year, it Is alleged, tho
baroness, belni short of funds, contrived a
plot with Lankmann for fabricating $100,
000 worth of the above mentioned shares
and disposing of them among purchasers
of pawn tickets. They hired a villa at Bols
Colombes. where they fabricated the goods
In absolute security. The fact Is, to set the
police off the track they told the author!- i
ties of a sham, burglary, so that a police-
man actually paced up and down before !
the villa for a week, little suspecting that
he was affording protection for a band of
forgers within. The plot, however, cume .
to grief when they attempted to dispose
of their wares. A purchaser of nawn tick-
cts to whom they offered several hundred
shares became suspicious and showed them
to the company. The fraud was at once
discovered and the entire band was speedily
captured.

Evidence that soliciting business in ap

This was offered to show the provision 1

of the exchange.
In the cross-examination County Attor

his membership In the exchange because
It was contrary to the rules of the ex
change to establish a second coal yard.
Mr. Sunderland identified the letter as his,
but said the resignation had not been ac
cepted. It was shortly after the receipt of this
letter the rules of the exchange were
amended to allow members to establish a
second conl yard. The county attorney con
tends the amendment makes no difference,
as the letter, he says, Is evidence the rule

cards was objected to.
"Is it the understanding In the exchange
that you can solicit In less than carload
lots?" asked the court.
"I never had any doubt of that In my own
mind."
"Who do they solicit business from, re
tailers or consumers T"
Mr. Sunderland said the cards were dis
tributed to consumers In the city and he
knew one was left at his house and at one
of his neighbors. He also Identified carbon
copies of orders taken by solicitors outside
the office. He said he had done more or less
soliciting himself.
"Were you governed and did you follow
the prices In the list Issued by the exchange
In fixing the prices of your coal?'
"We were not governed by these prices,
wo made our prices independently. On our
own coal these prices are our prices."
Question Is Rnled Oat.
Judge Sutton ruled out a question aa to
' wnat 'ontrolled and governed them In mak
Ing up their prices.
"Did you ever adopt or In any manner
agree upon prices In these cards with any
other dealers, or do you know of any two
or more dealers ao agreeing or adopting
these prices?"
"No, sir."
The cross-examination of the witness was
taken up by County Attorney Slabaugh.
He asked the witness to Interpret some of
the minutes of meetings, where It was
stated coal lists were handed In to the
secretary and prices were to go Into effect
' at a certain specified time. The witness
- said he was unable to say Just what was
meant. He aald his Arm frequently, varied
! from the price list as Issued,
"Then why hand in a list If you varied
j from it?" he was asked.
i "Tho nrlces we handed In are our own
! standard prices, but we varied from them."
"Did jou change the card prices without
' notifying the
secretary?"
"Yes, sir. we did."
"Was there not a
provision against
building more than one coal yard?"
"I think there was."
"If you started more than one yard in
competition with other dealers In other
parts of the city, were you not violating
the constitution and bylaws?'"
"Well, we rtld that while we were mem
bers of the exchange."
"Did you consider it a violation of the
constitution and bylaws that you aald you
I were not following?
Ignored the Constitution.

LEAD, S. I )., Dec. s. Special Telegram.)
'1 lii! .tlii.iTt' union nl Lead will inuot
Sunday in n..-a convention to deckle
win-Wicr or not they v. ill ko out on a
strike. The demands of the men are for
un eight-hour nay and a minimum dally
wage of $.1 .."hi for all nu n employed uiiut-r-giound.
The meetli g is called to discuss dillerenccg
between the inlneiH and lie I loiues'.ake
Mining company, and on the decision
reached by tno meeting will hinge the mat
ter of striking or not striking. At Uie
pnsi nt time it looks as though the men
favoring a strike will not be able to gathur
a rttiong enough following to cany tholr
point. This is the first thing that ha
looked like trouble between the company
and Its men since It began operations in
the Black Hills, ever twenty-eight years
ago, and, should the conservative element
of the Miners' u:ilon have Its way It will
bo ended by tomorrow evening. Should tha
men deride upon a strike it will imme
diately affect 2,3nO men, who receive wagen
ranglng from W to i! a day, and Indi
rectly affect every man In Lead, for the
city depends entirely upon the wages pa'.d
by tho Homestiiko company.
Tonight everything In the city Is quiet.
If there arc any radical people who are
anxious for trouble they arc keeping nut
of sight. No matter how the ijue'tion may
be decided .-t the nut-ting tomorrow, this
much Us certain, there will be no dla-ir-ders,
and the reports which have been
dent out to eastern papers by correspond
ent lo the effect that troops hnve been
naked for la falve. It Is not anticipated
that trouble will occur and the meeting
tomortow afternoon will be orderly and
the result of Its decision abided by,
Trouble Brewing" Limn Time.
For some time the present troublo has
been'brewlnt;, but so strong bus been the
sentiment In the local union ugilnsl rad
ical measures that It has never amounted
to anything until tho present time, whou
the movement has behind it tho weight of
tho Western federation, of which tho local
union is a branch. There are 1.1M) paid-up
memberiihlps In the Lead union and of this
number tho majority are married men witU
families, own their own homes and uie In
other Ways interested In the city. Here
tofore thU eh ment of tho union has been
able to sidetrack anything that savored of
a Mi'lke or trouble, but, I' U said, tha
ultimatum has gone forth from the head
quarters of tho Western federation that an
eight-hour day must be demanded by tho
Lead union and if It Is not granted ii
Btnko must be called. Should tho Le id
unly fil" 1,111 R B,rlkei lf lls demands
Bro not gtantcd, then It must forfeit U
' it ii i i ) i i i n ii 1 1 1 in i if ! ' i prn i i ni ru rum or
Miners. This bus hud tho i fleet of mak
ing inimy of tho conservative members of
the union look with favor on a slrlko, lf
ore must come.
One of the strongest arguments made In
favor of a tt"lko Is the fact that the
Black Hllla country i tho only ono In tha
west that has not In force the eight-hour
diiy and the only one that Is not paying
an average wa-ie of J1.50 to all men go.nu
under ground. But against this last ar
gue. lent is the fact that in no other mtno
In tho world are conditions of work r-o
pleasant and tho same caro for the sifety
of employes given.

It is certain that t lie company will not

It is pitpired to shut its works down; ia
fact, all of the work which bar been donu
for t lie last three weuis In the mines has
been to this end. Drifts arid Mop s in
