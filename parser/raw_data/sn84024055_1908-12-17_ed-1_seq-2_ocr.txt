FOUR HUNDRED SICK ,FOR ONE
BED. ,
Startling Revelation of the Lack
Accommodations for consump
tives. of
Fifteen thousand beds and 600,000
patients, or 400 consumptives for
every bed, is a statement made today
by the National Association for the
Study and Prevention of Tuberculosis
in its Investigation as to the need of
beds for destitute consumptives in the
United States.
Gathering statistics from every
State in the country and from every
hospital in which any provision what
ever is made for tuberculosis patients,
it has been found that the total num
ber of beds provided, both by public
and private resources, Is less than
15,000. Over against these figures, the
National Association for the Study
and Prevention of Tuberculosis has;
placed the fact that there are, ac
cording to the estimate of the United
States Bureau of the Census, at least
600,000 living cases of tuberculosis
in this country and that at least 200,
tiOO persons die from this disease
every year.
When. analyzed as to their geog
raphical distribution, New York State
leads the list with 3,556 beds, while
Pennsylvania comes next with over
1,500. Colorado and Massachusetts
each have over L250, while New Mex
ico, the next in order, has 915 beds
for consumptives. Several states pro
vide less than 20 beds, among these
being," Delaware, Kansas and South
Carolina, while some of the States,
such as Idaho, Wyoming, Utah and
Nevada, make no 'provision whatever
for tuberculosis patients, either, in
private or .public hospitals.
The Adirondack region in New York
State; Colorado, and particularly the
regions about Denver and Colorado
Springs; New Mexico, Arizona, and
the Southwest; and North Carolina,
are the principal Tesorts for consump-1
tives. The recent demonstrations of
experts, however, that tuberculosis
can be cured In any climate, has led
to a considerable distribution of the
bed -capacity and has called into ex
istence a large number of small sana
toria, hospitals, and day camps, some
of them with a capacity of "only six
beds. This Is shown by the fact that,
while the number of sanatoria during
the last four years has more than
doubled, the increase in the numberl
of beds, has been -only about 50 per
cent.
The most striking fact emphasized
by the investigation is that, while the
lack of beds for all classes of con
sumptives .is so manifest throughout I
the country, the number of beds need
ed for advanced cases is far greater
than the number needed for all the
other stages put together. Of the 15,
000 beds at present available for all
classes of consumptives, less than' 5,-
. 90 Are for advanced cases. Comput
ing that there are at least 200,000 liv
ing cases in the advanced stages of
tabercjBlosk-in the United States at
the present time, the need far a large
surafeesbf additional beds for this
iHCHfE deserving class is evident Dr.
John. S. BflllngB, of the Health De
partment of New York City, estimates
that about 18 to 70 per cent of the ad
vanced cases are unable to provide
for their proper care at home. This
'jaeaas that over 12,000 beds in hospi
tals for advanced -cases should be pro
vided. The seed i or accoBamodaUon
for advanced cases is farther empha
sised by the fact that every expert and
specialist has agreed, oa this, ooscla
sfea, that ooBSSBpttea wifl sever Se
eradicated lata the advanced cases
of the disease are isolated, either In
their homos or in IwtJtatiaas. Dc
says, Tm ease ef tafeercalo-
sfco-ria he Jaeiated as- lafeg s fc
1 are there. Dr. Arthur Mm
holme, one of the best English spe
cialists on tuberculosis, says that the
only tray In which, the death, rate from
consumption can be reduced is by
segregating nil advanced cases, be
cause these are the centers of lnfec
tlon from which the disease spreads.
. It is not difficult, the National Asso
ciation affirms, to cure consumption, in
Its oarly stages, but it Is impossible
to effect a. cure in 'the latter stages
of the disease, and, consequently,
these cases should be removed or
Isolated in. their homes in order to
prevent the infection of persons, liv
ing with them. But they cannot be
removed or isolated unless hospitals
are provided for that 'purpose; and
with this end In view, .a campaign to
secure more accommodations for ad
vanced cases of tuberculosis Is being
carried on all over the country. When
enough beds are provided. It Is esti
mated that the death rate from con
sumption will be cut in half and there
will be an annual saving to the coun
try of 100,000 lives.

A BIG CONTRACT.
Black Diamond Development Company
Places a Contract for Ten More
Gas Wells on Their Property.
Information has just been received
from Kansas that the contract for ten
more Gas wells on the Black Diamond
properties has been signed and that
the driling rig had been moved to B.
D. D. Co. No. 11, and that as fast as
the contractor can finish one well he
will start another and so on until No.
20 has been brought in and finished.
This will be good ews for those who
are stockholders in this company as
this contract means as much more
work will be done on their property
during the next six months as has
been done during the past three years,
and no one was asked to buy a -dollars
worth' of stock in order to get
this development done.
The Board of. Directors have been
quietly at work for several weeks on
the deal and put it through and had
it closed before any one was made
aware of the fact that any such gigan
tic deal was on foot, and they cer
tainly ueserve great credit for the
hard work that they have done for
this company.
At the Stockholders' meeting in Oc
tober AH of the former Board was
re-elected, and also the. officers for
another -year, and tho -closing of this
deal shows the wisdom of such action,
for the deal has been "on the fire" for
sometime.
The members of the Board of Direc
tors are wearing a broad smile these
days and can well afford to do so.

President Roosevelt and the Browns-
I ..III. A -!..
WHIG "
Concluded from Page 1.
' The President's special message sub
mitted to Congress yesterday is an
extraordinary climax of an extraor-
dinarj- course of unwarranted accusa-
tionh and of disregard of justice and
the rules of evidence. It adds no evi
dence against the discharged soldiers.
Its savor of manufactured evidence"
discredits the case of tho administra
tion. The public, little concerned in
the cause of justice for the Negro
troops in the first place, and Influ
enced by prejudice which has been
incited against the senatorial cham
pion of these soldiers, may not be in
clined to consider the case on Its
merits. But If prejudice Is laid aside,
and it justice Is recognized, the PresI
dent's latest witness, Conyers and
Lawson the detective, are likely to be
effective witnesses for the defence."
NEGRO WHO SAVED THE FLAG
DEAD. -
Boston, Dec. 9. William H. Carney,
color sergeant of the Fifty-fourth
Massachusetts Volunteers In the
civil war, composed of Colored men
under Col. Robert Gould Shaw died
to-day following an elevator accident
Carney was at the side of Col. Shaw
when that commander fell, and after
ward was badly wounded. As he
crawled off the battlefield he held the
flag aloft until comrades came to his
assistance, and he greeted them with
the words often quoted In Massachu
setts: "The old flag never touched
the ground."
The Negroes in general have lost
one of their oldest and most renowned
soldiers. He was the link between
the old regime and the new condition,
and Boston feels It keener than any
other part of the country the loss of
such an eminent man. A character
such as William H. Carney adds more
to Negro's contribution to militarism
than half of the speeches that might
be made, relating their exploits.

Inducements to Drink. v
In Catania an enterprising wine
dealer has Initiated a novel scheme of
drinking by the hour ad libitum. For
15 cents -one may drink for sixty min-

5 cents a liter. The chances are, how
ever, in favor of the merchant, for It
requires a strong stomach to drink
three liters of Etna wine in one hour.
At a neighboring town the charge is
10 cents for the first hour and 15
cents for two. The fashion seems to
have "caught on," and at Bologna,
where the wines ore better, the charge
is 41 cents for the first hour, 31 cents )
xor tne secona ana vu cents zor the

ments to drink is said not to be en

HUMOR OF THE HOUR
Obeying Instructions.
A milkman who lives in a town of
New England and collects milk fr j
the neighboring farmers had in bis m
ploy a boy whom he scut about v. i.u
a wagon every morntog picking ui l.s
supply. There Is a rather danor.us
railroad crossing on the roaU. aul
when the boy began work for Imii the
milkman said, "When there's a train
coming just stop and sit still In your
wagon till it gets by."
The boy went about his task, but in
stead of collecting the milk in about
an hour and a half, as should have
been done, he took at least two hours
and sometimes more.
The milkman crumbled a little, but
the boy said nothing, and as he seem
ed honest nothing was done.
One evening the milkman went orc
his route to see some of his customers.
"What ails that boy of yours?" asked
one of the farmers.
"Why, nothing, only that he's rather
slow," was the reply.
"Slowl Well, I guess you'd think he
was slow if you saw him resting for
half an hour in his wagon down there
by the railroad track every morning."
"Is It true that you stop half an hour
every morning down at the railroad
track?" the boy was asked.
"Yes, sir; I have to," said the boy.
"Have to! What do you mean?"
"Well, sir, you told me to stop when
there was a train coming and to wait
till It got by. There's a crook In the
track there, so t I never can see
whether there's a train coming down
the track or not So I just stop an'
