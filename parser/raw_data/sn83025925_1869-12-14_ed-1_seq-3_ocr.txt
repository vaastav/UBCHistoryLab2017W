THE LEAGUE.
Annual ftlertinv nl the I'nlon I.envue-Klec-llon
ol' O direr.
Ijisl evening the annual meeting of the Union
Iague of Philadelphia was held at the League
House, Broad and Sansom streets. After the
transaction of the usual routine of business, the
annual report was read, of which the following
is an abstract:
The Report commences with a eulogy of Gen
eral Grant, and expresses satisfaction that no
single act of the President looks like a depar
ture irom me strictest principles ot tuo Union
party. The policy of General Grant's adminis
tration is then adverted to, and It Is claimed that
it is characterized by honesty, economy, impar
tiality, and wisdom. The report states:
If the promises which the administration now
gives be verified and it needs little more thau
adherence to the present policy to bring that
anoui wno may calculate tnewcaitti, tuo power,
the political solidity, and the influence in the
world's affairs to which our country will attain
within the life of a generation of men ? The
bonds which hold together these States are
stronger to-day than they have ever been slnco
tho adoption of tho Federal Constitution. As
far as the eye may look, we can seo no cause.
however distant, that may again threaten the
Union. '
Wo have had reason to rejoice, with onr fel
low members of the In Ion party, at three im
portant events which have taken place in our
Mate since tue last annual meeting of the
League: the passage of a constitutional Rcsrls-
try law, the decision of tho courts in tho con
tested election eases, and tho re-election of
our candidates for Governor and Supreme Judge.
In the early part of tho summer a single
point of public Interest Invited and received the
attention ot tue Hoard. 1 he Danisninent of the
heads of Washington and Jackson from the
postage stamps most in use, and the remarkable
substitution of the representations of a locomo
tive engine ana a mounted post-boy iu their
places, had been publicly criticized in the
League with great dissatisfaction and regret,
and subsequently tho subject was brought
directly to the attention of tho board. In such
an uu worthy change we were satlstied tho
administration of President Grunt had taken no
part. Tho new stamps had been
prepared by the contractors under
President Johnson. A committee was
appointed to communicate to the
Postmaster-General what the board bclievod
to be the general feeling in the League on the
subject, and such a representation was accord
ingly made. I he miscarriage ot his letter ap
pears to have deprived tho Board of the receipt
of the Postmaster-General's acknowledgment of
our communication. Wo learn, however, that
the memorial of the committee was received,
and its suggestions carefully considered. We
have reason to suppose that our views coincided
with those ot the rostmaster-ueucrai, as we
have the satisfaction to learn that new dies arc
now in preparation, and five profile and five full
lace heads ot Washington, Hamilton, r rank.hu.
Jackson, and Lincoln are to be substituted for
tho ten denominations ot stamps, ana that the
present stamps are to bo withdrawn as soon as
possible.
mo report oi tuo ubrary committee exhibits
a sensible and proper activity in that depart
ment. Lost year the Board of Directors made
an appropriation of two thousand dollars for the
purchase of books, and this year they have ap
propriated twenty-nve nunarea aoiiars lor tho
same purpose, with these appropriations the
foundations of a library have been laid.
Tho total uuiubcr of volumes now in tho
library amounts to twenty-six hundred and
ci'-'htv-nine.
Tho roll of the League, on tho first day of De
cember, 1800, contaiued tho names of one thou
sand eight hundred and fifty-eight members. Of
this number, ninety-three were eleeted since the
date of the last report. We have lost since that
date, sixty-eight members by resignation, twenty
oy death, ana tuiriy-uino were suspended lor
non-payment oi their annual dues.
The reports of tho Treasurer and of the Audi
tors for tho year lSti'J are now upon tho table for
examiuatiou. The income of the Leutruo for tho
year ending on the first of December, 1800, was
inly thousand and eighty-two dollars and lifty
elgtit cents, which, added to the surplus of the
previous year, amounts to sixty-seven thousand,
nine hundred aud sixty-two dollars aud thirty-
six cent. The disbursements for the same pe
riod were lorty-seven thousand, nve hundred
and ninety-eight dollars ana one cent, leaving a
surplus of twenty thousand, three hundred and
si.xiy-l'onr dollars and thirty-fivo cents. Thoro
is no indebtedness outstanding to diminish this
amount, faking into consideration the nourish
ing condition of our treasury, the directors have
lixed the anuual tax for tho following year at
twenty-iivo dollars. t
An election ol otneers for tho ensuing year
was then proceeded with, and after an exciting
coiiK'ft tlio following ticket was elccted:-

Mrssner, the Hoehpster wlfe-ninnlnrnr, narrowly
escaped hanging yesterday, and, oven with the
respite, It Is UtotfetlHT provable that he will at no
distant time he executed. About 11 o'clock
the slierltr, with niemlxrs Of the prens, and a few
friends of the prisoner, went to the cell in which he
Is coutlned. He wu being dressed for execution by

back of a chair near hy, and on the window
leiln-n lav an nnen book of devotion, orlntfld In Uur-
nuin, arid a photograph from a plctura of tho Virgin
Mary. The unlocking of the door did not appear to
attract his attention, but the tramping of many feet
caused bun to turn around with a quick, spasmodic
motion ; his eyes were fixed on the floor, and his
teeth llrnily set ; he evldcnily thought they had come
to lead him to his death. He held out his hand to
tho hherlir without a word, but expression hy his
manner that ho recoKnled tho duty Imposed upon
that official. The Sheriff, almost too affected to
sneak aloud, whispered in his ear. "A respite luw
eurne: a sUiv of proceed inn has been granted.'
Messner replied with a puzzled look, as though he
did not understand, npou which Hheriff Sutherland
said to him, "You still live. You will not be hanged
to-dav." Mke an electric flush the looks, manner,
and beating of tho man chanired : the firm set teeth
relaxed; the eye, schooled to hardness, betrayed his
emotions, and the blood receded from nis cheeks.
