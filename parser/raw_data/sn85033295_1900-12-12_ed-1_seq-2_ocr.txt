QUIT THEIR KEYS.
Santa Fe Railway Operators Obey an
Order to Go Out on a Sym
pathy Strike.
Chicag'o, Dec. 10. —Between 2,500 and
3,000 telegmaph operators on the Atchi
son, Topeka & Santa Fe railroad, cov
ering - the territort' from Chicago to
San Francisco, left their desks Satur
day afternoon and walked out on a
strike. According to the men, advices
from points along the 5,000 miles of
track in the system indicated that the
freight traffic was practically tied up
and that passenger trains were run
ning slowly, with no further destina
tion than the next division terminal.
Railroad officials, however, denied these
tales and averred that not more than
GOO operators had struck. The order
that precipitated the walk-out was
sent from headquarters in St. Louis
by M. M. Dolphin, president of the
order of Railway Telegraphers. He esti
mated that 97 per cent, of the telegraph
operators on the road had obeyed his
order.
Wh en the order was given the men
turned their signals at the various sta
tions along the line so that the red
lights would show. This being the sig
nal for trains to stop, most of them
were tied up for a time until dummies
could be dispatched to turn the signals
and permit the trains to run on sched
ule time.
The strike is purely sympathetic
and has been called to support the de
mands of the 300 operators who since
Thursday have been out on strike on
the Gulf, Colorado and San Francisco
division of the Atchison, Topeka &
Santa Fe railroad. The dispute there
has been regarding wages and rules
and the strike was called following re
fusal of the railway officials to arbi
trate. The points at issue were not in
themselves considered of the highest
importance, but the great cause of com
plaint was based upon the corporation’s
refusal to permit the dispute to be set
tled by arbitration. The total amount
of the salar\ r in dispute on the Galves
ton branen did not aggregate more
than $195 a month nor were the rules
at issue of vital importance.
Dispatches from divisional points
along the line of the Santa Fe rail
way indicate tnr t the great sj’stem is
badly crippled by the strike of the
telegraphers, trains being late and
in some instances “lost.” All passen
ger trains are moving, however, and
many freight trains are struggling
along as best they can. Passenger
traffic, Topeka reports, has been
greatly reduced. While admitting
some embarrassment, the officials of
the road in Chicago and other cities
declare that the strike is broken; that
before the week is over operators will
have been provided for all of the va
cant positions and the train service
will again be on a normal basis. The
officers of the Order of Railway Teleg
raphers take a hopeful view of the
situation. President Dolphin declar
ing at Galveston that the strike is far
more effective than the railway men
are willing to admit.
Topeka, Kan., Dec. 10. —The officials
of the Santa Fe road take a decidedly
hopeful view of the telegraphers’
strike situation. They all say the
backbone of the strike is practically
broken already, and that the affairs
of the road will be in their normal
condition inside of two weeks. The
officers felt justified, in view of the
alleged improvement in conditions, in
rescinding the order closing the shops.
Strikers’, representatives say that
practically all the telegraphers on the
Atchison, Topeka & Santa Fe proper
are still out. A few men returned to
work Sunday morning under the im
pression that the strike had been
called off, and were later on induced
'to join the strikers. Later in the
day they were all out to a man west
of Emporia. Not a man will return to
work unless their grievances are set
tled in the fullest possible manner.
Some of them have already other
prospects offered them on other roads,
and will accept them if the Santa Fe
management persists in its present
course.
Kansas City, Mo., Dec, 10, —The Times
says: Within the next 48 hours the
walk-out of the Santa Fe operators
may widen into a general strike and
the members of the Order of Railway
Telegraphers be joined by those of the
Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers,
the Order of Railway Conductors, the
Brotherhood of Locomotive Firemen
and the Brotherhood of Railway Train
men. Such is the danger that tele
graphers say now threatens the great
passenger and freight business of the
Sawta Fe from Chicago to the Pacific
coast and the Gulf of Mexico.
Death of Mrs. McLean.
Washington, Dec. 10.—Mrs. Mary L.
McLean, the mother of John R. Mc-
Lean, of the Cincinnati Enquirer, died
here at her residence at 1:30 o’clock
Sunday morning of acute heart affec
tion. She had been ill since Friday
last and from the first attack her life
was despaired of. At the bedside of
Mrs. McLean when the end came
were her daughters, Mrs. Dewey and
Mrs. Ludlow, the wife of Rear Admiral
Ludlow; her son, Mr. John R. Mc-
Lean, and Admiral Dewey. Mrs. Mc-
Lean was the widow of the late
Washington McLean, proprietor of the
Cincinnati Enquirer. She was in her
seventy-second year.

The Home of Mrs. Lizzie M. Brewer at Westerly, R. I.
In a letter to Dr. Hartman concerning the
merits of Pe-ru-na, Mrs. Brewer writes,
among other things:
Westerly, R. I.
“Dear Dr. Hartman —I find Pe-ru-na £
sure cure for all catarrhal affections so com
mon in this part of the country. It cures
a cold at once. There is no cough
that can at all equal Pe-ru-na. As for la
grippe, there is no other remedy that can
at all compare with Pe-ru-na.
“I am among the sick a great deal in our
city and have supplied many invalids with
Pe-ru-na, simply because I am enthusiastic
in my faith as to its results. I have never
known it to fail to quickly and permanently
remove that demoralized state of the hu
man system which follows la grippe.
“In all cases of extreme weakness I use
Pe-ru-na with perfect confidence of a good
result. In cases of weakness peculiar to my
sex I am sure that no other remedy'can ap
Deterrent.
“You have not gone to Europe, then, as
you expected,” said Mrs. Fosdick to Mrs.
Spriggs.
“Xo,” was the reply. “It Is so difficult for
Mr. Spriggs to leave his business, and i
really couldn't go without him. And, then,
I read the other day about a ship that
broke her record. Think how dreadful it
would be to be on a ship in the middle of the
ocean with her record broken.” —Detroit

The Little Masterpiece Library is edited
by PROFESSOR BLISS PERRY, formerly
Professor of English Literature in Prince
ton University, now Editor of The Atlantic
Monthly, It is no hastily selected compila
tion for an ephemeral sale. The Editor has
chosen, with the greatest care and con
scientiousness those CHEFS D’OEUVRES
of the greatest English-speaking writers
which are of such beauty and value as to
be at the foundation of English culture.
Yet hefto many people can say that they have thor
oughly assimilated, or even hastily read all of these
immortal works?
The binding and printing of the volumes are
beautifully executed. The size and shape are so
convenient that the books fairly invite the reading
that every intelligent American would want to have
as a part of his or her intellectual culture. Each
volume, bound in handsome red cloth, contains a
really One and artistic photogravure frontispiece
of the celebrated writer whose masterpiece it con
tains.
A more charming addition to a library,
one that will be REALLY READ, or a
more tasteful Christmas gift—or twelve
Christmas gifts, for the volumes are not
numbered/—could, not be Imagined.
The publishers of Masterpiece
Library have sold it at the rate of
SB.OO for the 12 volume*, and have
claimed It was at that rate an excep
tional bargain.
