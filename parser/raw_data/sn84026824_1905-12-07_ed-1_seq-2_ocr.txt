The insurance rascals are on the
run.
Congress will make or break
many a politician this session.
Our advice to Senator Elkins is to
climb into the band-wagon before it
is too late.
If Congress shall be as good as the
President wishes it to be, it will be
very good indeed.

We wish to suggest two

In otlering his resignation as president
of the Mutual Life Insurance
Company, Richard McCurdy gave as
his reason tUe tact that he is sick.
We'll bet fie is not as sick as the policy-holders.

The Pennsylvania Railroad announces
that it will hereatter issue no
more Iree passes, and Congressmen,
judges, legislators and politicians generally
must pay lur their tickets. This
is simply a threat to law-makers of
high and low degree not to interfere
with this giant monopoly.
We wish to assure our friend
Ilornor, of the Parkersburg Sentinel,
that the editor of the Register voted
the straight Democratic ticket, from
Preeideut to constable, last fall, and
tnat if he had had a thousand votes
they would all have been cast for
John Cornweil lor Governor. Now
it the Sentinel can get a similar plain
statement lrom Col. Stalnaker it may
rest easier.
It is announced that Geo. W. Perkins
is soon to retire from the vicepresidency
of the New York Life Insurance
Company. Mr. Perkins is
the gentleman who as vice-president
ot tue msurauce company and a member
of the firm of J. P. Morgan & Co.
robbed the policy-holders gwiue and
comin'. He speculated with the insurance
funds. When he won, he
put tiie profits in hid pockets; when
he lost he charged it up to the insurance
company.
Richard A. McCurdy ha? resigned
as president of the Mutual Life Insurance
Company of New York and
his resignation has been accepted. It
was only a few weeks ago that Mc*
Curdy boldly and defiantly announced
his determination to hold on to the
place in which he was so dishonest,
but he has beeu forced to yield to the
pre-sure of outraged policy-holders.
He retires in disgrace, broken in
health and spirit and bereft of the re
epect of the people in general. It is
a question of only a short time until
all the rascals will be forced out of
insurance companies.
Just as we suspected, there was
nothing at all in the charges of improper
management by the officers of
the State Reform School at Pruntytown.
A committee of the State
Board ol Health made a thorough investigation,
and its report shows that
the institution is admirably managed
in every respect and all conditions
are entirely satisfactory. The committee
gives the highest credit to Superintendent
Darnall and his excellent
wife. His business ability, energy
and progressiveness are admirably
supplemented by the gentle and
refining influence of Mrs. Darnall,

The opening session of the Fiftyninth
Congress began :u Washington
on- Monday. Congressman Joe Cannon.
of Illinois, was agaiu" elected
Speaker of the House, the Democrats
voting for John Skarpe Williams as
their candidate. The gag rules of
the laBt House were adopted, thus insuring
the tyrannical rule of a tew of
the leaders. In the Senate a brief
session was held, with Vice-Piesident
Fairbanks presiding. Senator Mitchell,
of Oregon, and Senator Burton,
of Kansas, both of whom are en route
to the penitentiary, wTere conspicuous
by their absence, but Senator Depew,

The President's Message.
The message of President Roosevelt
was read in both houses of Congress
on Tuesday. The following,
in brief, are the recommendations
that he makes:
That the national Government assert
its sovereignty over private corporations
bythe regulation of industrial activities.

given the power to decide whether a
railroad rate is just, to prescribe a maximum

be effective within a reasonable time,
subject to review by the courts; any
kind of commission or rebate (unless
for service rendered) to be prohibited ;
that the accounts of railroads be subject
to examination as are the accounts
of national banks. The President says
he opposes Government ownership of
railroads.
That Congress consider limiting the
hours of labor required of railroad em
ployes and the compulsory use of the
block system and other safety devices.
That insurance be under the supervision
and regulation of the Federal
Government.

of fixing maximum and minimum tariil
rates to beappied to countries which
favor or discriminate against the United

contributions be required bylaw; thai
all contributions by corporations for political
purposes be prohibited by law.

be confirmed by treaty in order to pre
vent chaos in that republic.
That promotions in the army here
after be by selection and not by senior
ity.

creased in number, but that one bat
lleship be built each year to replace
some vessel of out-of-date type.

TO WEAK WOMEN
Of Shepherdstown and Vicinity, We
Blake the Following Proposition.
"There are hundreds of women in
this vicinity who are dragging themselves
through life in pain and misery,
without vitality, strength or health,"
said the proprietor of Reinhart's Pharmacy.
"They get no happiness out of
life and are just in a condition to be attacked
by almost any disease.' They
need a vitality making and strengthcreating
tonic.
"Now at our expense wo want to ask
every such woman in Shepherdstown
to try our cod liver oil preparation, Vinol,
which contains in a highly concentrated
form all of the medicinal elements
of cod liver oil, but no oil or
grease. It is delicious to take, creates
a healthy appetite, makes pure, rich,
red blood and gives strength and vigor
tn ovprv nrirftn nf the bodv better than
any medicine we have ever sold in our
store, and when a woman is in poor
condition it makes life worth living.
When we say 'at our expense,' we mean
that if the medicine you buy from us
and pay for does not benefit you, we
will refund every oent paid us for it."
Miss Mary A. Woodward says : "I
think Vinol is the best remedy in the
world for a weak, tired, wornout system.
I was just in that condition when
I commenced to take Vinol, It gave
me new life and energy. I feel well,
strong and better than I have-for years."
"We can only ask Shepherdstown
women to try Vinol on our guarantee."

Happenings at Kearneysvilie.
Mrs. D. W. Border and her daughter,
MargAret May, are visiting friends in
Shippensburg, Pa. The latter, with
her cousin, Margaret Oetzendanner, had
a night party givin in their honor, by
their Aunts, Misses Phoebe and May
Getzendanner, at the beautiful home of
the latter in Charles Town on thanksgiving
night.
Mr. and Mrs. F. O. Trump had a delightful
visit to the Western side of the
State, Frank being a delegate from the
Masonic Lodge of Shenandoah Junction
to the Grand Lodge. Frank seems to
be the leading man at present amongst
us?in fact, without him Kearneysvilie
would be in the background ; but he
with indomitable will and up-to-date
enterprise has done much to build up
our enterprising village. It's Frank's
new cider press, Frank's new depot,
his new store and now he has bought 15
acres of land from the Homsher estate,
sold enough otf In building lots?a doz
en or more?to pay for the whole, leaving
him a nice slice along the pike on
the clear. On this he will build for his
own use a fine resident and plant an
apple orchard. Among those who purchased
from him is our village painter,
Mr. Brown, who will build for himself
a nice home adjoining the estate of A.
S. Miller.
The quarry company has also erected
on their own premises twelve new
houses, to accommodate their workmen
with families, and contemplate, I am
told, building in the neighborhood, to
supply the demand, twenty more. They
now have running three or four crushers,
employing several hundred men,
among whom are a large number of
Huns and Slavs. Wages run from $1
to $3 per day.
F. C. Homsher, of' Baltimore, has
been home on a visit, and incidentally
settling up some business matters pertaining
to the estate of his father, the
late Theodore Homsher.
George Cox, one of the quarry foremen,
is very proud?says it is a boy,

of the columns of the Register to
express his thanks to the members of
Elk Branch and Shenandoah Junction
Churches, as well as to others who So
kindly and generously remembered man
and beast at the manse on Thanksgiving
Day. These kind and considerate remembrances
not only assist the pastor
financially, but add greatly to the pleasure
of himself and family, and strengthen
the bonds of atrection between pastor
and people.
SIN'S CONSEQUENCES.
Innocent Indulgence Often Brings Trouble.
Reinhart's Pharmacy Offers Means
of Escape.
The consequences of violating physical
law are often as unpleasant as
the breaking of a moral rule. The
innocent indulgence of over-eating
brings consequences that amount to
real suffering. Indigestion is not nat
D- n ?
ural; it is not right; it should aot be.
Reinhart's Pharmacy offers a means
of escape in Mi-o-na tablets that is
simple and practical.
These simple tablets are composed
of such valuable medicinal agents as
bismuth subgallate, which is superior
to all other remedies for stomach troubles,
cerium oxalate, and tonics and
correctives which promote the action
of the digestive organs, strengthen the
whole digestive tract, and make it
possible to eat what you like and when
you like.
Ask Reinhart's Pharmacy to show
you the guarantee under which they
sell Mi-o-na. It costs nothing unless
it cures. The risk is all theirs.
Furious Fighting.
"For seven years," writes Geo. W.
Hoffman, of Harper, Wash., "I had a
bitter battle wiih chronic stomach and
liver trouble, but at last I won, and
cured my diseases, by the use of Electric
Bitters. I unhesitatingly recommend
them to all, and don't intend in
the future to be without them in the
house. They are certainly a wonderful
medicine, to have cured such & bad
case as mine." Sold under guarantee
to do the same for you, at Reinhart's
Pharmacy, at 50c. a bottle. Try them

One hundred thousand Jews, each
wearing a band of crepe on the left
arm, marched under a myriad of black
banners through the principal streets
of the East Side in New York on
Monday, accompanied by bands playing
dirges in memory of the Jews
massacred in Russia. Hundreds of
women and children, grouped in singing
bands, were scattered throughout
the long parade.
Failed.
All efforts have failed to find a better
remedy for coughs, colds and lung
troubles than Foley's Honey and Tar.
It stops the cough, heals the luDgs and
prevents serious results from a cold.
J. N. Patterson. Nashua, Iowa, writes":
"Last winter I had a bad cold on my
lungs and tried at least half a dozen advertised
cough medicines and had
treatment from two physicians without
getting any benefit. A friend recommended
Foley's Honey and Taraud two
thirds of a bottle cured me. I consider
it the greatest cough and lung medicine
in the world." Reinhart's Pharmacy.
If you contemplate getting engaged
or marrisd, call on J. E. Romine and
see his extensive line of signet, band
and set rings. ?
