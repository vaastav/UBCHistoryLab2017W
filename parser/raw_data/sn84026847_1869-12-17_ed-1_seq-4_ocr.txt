policy of the Government. He advo
cated repudiation of the natiosal debt.
Mr. Bandall said? I am utterly, op
posed to repudiation. The moment al
lowed to me gives me the opportunity
to remonstrate against the enunciation
of any scheme 01 legislation which, I
believe, wonld place my country in a
dishonest attitude before the world.
Not only dol believe that Ave should
pay the debt, but I believe
what is ?f vastly more im
portance, that the country has the
ability> the disposition and the resour
ces to pay it. I agree with the gentle
man from Ohio that tliiB debt was nego
tiated aft ruinous rates. That is a mat
ter of just criticism against the party
who then controlled the Government
and made the negotiateon, but as those
who sold bonds upon which is stamped
the faith and credit of the country. I
say repudiation stands in no other light
except the light of dishonesty.
Messrs. Wood, of New York, Kerr,
Potter, Cox and Woodward, expressed
similar sentiments.
During the discussion the Republican

thy the honor and good name of the
nation, and that the House without dis
tinction of party hereby sets its real
condemnation on any and all such pro
positions.
The committee then rose and the j
Speaker having resumed the chair.
