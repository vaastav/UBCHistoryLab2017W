PITTSBURG, 8UNDAY. DEC. 8. 1S88.
CIBCUWSTAHaTAL BUT IMPBOBABTiE,
How much dependence is to be placed
Upon the reported plan for the organization
of a great international bank under the
'auspices of Pope Leo is, at least, a debatable
question. "While a New Tork paper under
takes to give names of directors and details
as to location, capital and manner of opera
tion, wi(h much semblance of particularity,
the general tendency will be to await con
firmation before accenting the report
It is improbable the banking business can
"be conducted to advantage in connection
with religions organizations. Experiments
which have been made by church organiza
tions in the TJnited States in the conduct of
.financial enterprises on a great scale are not
particularly encouraging. The experience
of the publishing concerns of Bome of the
Evangelical churches, and of Archbishop
Purcell, at Cincinnati, were not hopeful in
that regard. In this country, at least,
ecclesiastical banking would scarcely be re
garded as ol great help either to any of the
denominations or to the general business in
terests. In this view it sounds rather absurd to
hear it stated that grave fears are expressed
by some of the leading New York financiers
about the "vast political as well as financial
influence" which would attach to the new
enterprise. Neither politics nor business
in the TJnited States tends toward a denomi
national basis. And like as not, regardless
of the circumstantiality of the account pub
lished by the New York Herald yesterday,
it will be found that the plans of the re
ported new bank are more imaginary than

SMOKING FOB CLEEGTMEH.
, The disenssion of the question, ''Should
' Clergymen Smoke?" in another part of this
issue, gives a variety of views on the
subject which are more or less valuable as
personal opinions. The logical way of
determining the matter would be by first
settling the prior question, "Should any
man smoke?" and then governing the
clergymen by the decision as to all man
kind. If it be injurious and wrong for
bankers and lawyers to smoke, then, it
would be for clergymen to do so; if the
former find it salutary or innocuous the
clergymen have the same right to partake
of a harmless enjoyment as other men; just
as they have the same right to drink Java
coffee or eat Saratoga potatoes. The ques
tion may be of importance just as it may be
Taluable to determine whether bankers
should indulge in chicken salad or criminal
lawyers eat mince pie. But the decision
must apply to all humanity and not to any
especial class or profession.
BttCOJTS OBJECT LESS0K.
If the vanished Silcott had planned his
' departure for the sole purpose of giving the
4 statesmen with whom be enjoyed snch con
fidential terms, an object lesson on the ne
cessity of an amended extradition law, he
could not have done it more completely. By
delicately skating along the edge of the ex
? traditable offenses, and paying back the
h money which he had obtained through
. forgeries," which might have brought him
back, the departed Silcott is able to live in
Canada comfortably on the salaries of the
statesmen, and the fleeced Congressmen are
left to profound reflections on the inade
quacy of extradition.
It is an old principle that it gives a man
the most thorough insight into an injury, to
have his own ox gored; and the Congress-
'f 'men whose cash accounts are depleted with-
i out any way of getting at the robber, will
"be deeply impressed with the wrongs of pub
lic plunder. It is true that several thrifty
legislators have already developed a theory
that the TJnited States must make up the
loss. They may log-roll the measure through
Congress, but nevertheless the discomforts of
making the TJnited States treasury pay their
salaries twice over, on account of a loss of
which ineir own agent was tne cause,
should make them eager for improved ex
tradition laws, and create some fellow
feeling on their part with the people who
supply the funds in the treasury.
Taking it all in all, a certain admiration
at the originality of Silcott's stroke is irre-
"prestible. Baidson the treasury have be
come commonplace in the House he served,
and were by no means horrifyiug to some of
the members thereof. But Silcott struck
out a new line by raiding the private treas-
fraj of the Congressmen, and let in a flood
of new light as to the possibilities of grab
bing any funds that can be got at.
A C0EP0BATE BABIES.
A Tery striking example of corporate
morals is exposed to public view in the
history of a case just decided by the "Wis
consin Supreme Court. One company made
an agreement with another that if the latter
would secure from the Legislature a valu
able land grant, the first would give in re
turn valuable trackage rights. The legisla
tive lobbying was done successfully, and
railroad No. 1 got its land grant; bnt when
called'upon to perform its half of the bar
gain refused to do it The suit to make it
do so was thrown out by the courts nn ihn
ground that it was void at against public
(' policy and tending to corruption. The
legal and moral aspect of the decision is in
disputable: but it seems as if the criminal 1
conrU .might have sossethinj: to say to the
parties to such, a bargain. In the meantime
the corporations who dispose of legislative
acts as a matter of barter, should have dis
cretion enough to at least .keep their con
tracts a secret
FBANCE'S SCHEME OF TAXATION.
It appears from one of our cable specials
that the French Government proposes to
adopt the measure agitated in this country
last rear, of imposing a capitation tax on all
foreigners in France, and a further tax on
all employers of foreign-born labor. The
amount of taxation is not very great, being
$4 80 on the foreigners who do not work,
and $10 in addition on each laborer of other
nationalities.
The measure may be a good one for a na
tion which desires to keep ont foreigners.
With regard to those who simply go to
France to sojourn there, the impression has
been that France desired their presence, and
that they were already sufficiently taxed by
the tradesmen, art dealers and hotel keepers.
The tax on the laborers, on the other hand,
will be heavy enough to exclude a great
many such laborers or to force them into
pauperism. But as labor is the creator of
wealth, it does not seem a logical deduction
either to shut it out or to force it into invol
untary idleness at the expense of the public
Measures of this sort are bettor adapted
to the Chinese or Corean objects of Govern
ment than to those which are supposed to be
aimed at by civilized Bepublics like France
and the United States.
THE L1TXUBY 0? DECABEHCK
Mrs. Frank Leslie's discussion of the
growth of bachelor, or "Benedict," chambers
in which the unmarried man is made com
fortable for life without any thought of
marriage, unfolds a very plausible and
probably correct theory, as to the effect of
wealth and luxury, in making social life
selfish and consequently predisposing young
men who wish to enjoy life untrammeledby
family caret, against marriage.
But it involves more than the question of
matrimony when it is represented by a
writer on social subjects, that it is the
destiny, as a nation gains in wealth, that
makes "capital become concentrated, rich
men wealthier, poor men poorer, and labor
less honorable." This has been the result in
most cases because of the existence of special
privileges for certain classes;but to assert that
it is inevitable, is to abandon the funda
mental principles of our Government. The
American Bepublio is founded on the belief
that by giving all men equal chances the'
gain in wealth will be widely distributed;
and while the old result is repeated in many
cases, it is, in every case of egregious wealth,
directly traceable to the fact that the princi
ple of equality of opportunity and impar
tial treatment before the law, has been vio
lated. The story is sot ail told until it is pointed
out that the stage of wealth and luxury,
which produces the effects that Mrs. Leslie
deplores, is only reached by the nullification
of our democratic principles and generally
by the violation of the laws.
BISHOP TDIGG'S DEATH.
The death of Bishop Tuigg at the epis
oopal residence yesterday removes the head
of the Catholic Church in this diocese, who
has had control of that powerful religious
organization since the retirement ol Bishop
Domenec many years ago. The executive
bead of a large and centralized organization
like the Catholio Church exerts a powerful
influence in the community, and probably
few men have exercised a greater effect oh
Pittsburg's population, with so little promi
nence before the general public, as the late
prelate. His administration of the diocese
revealed a character in which a strong will,
energetic temperament and decided convic
tions were leading features. Perhaps as
just a measure of his work as can be found
may be taken from the growth of the,hos
pitals, colleges and seminaries supported by
the Catholio denomination in this diocese,
and in the enhancement of the numerical
power and prosperity of his church.
STANLEY'S BELIEF IK PE0YIDENCE.
One remarkable characteristic appears
in the letters from Stanley, which have
reached the world since he has emerged
from the African wilds through which he
conducted his great researches. That is his
frank and unreserved avowal of his belief
in the aid of an overruling and divine
Providence which rescued himself and his
allies from the greatest dangers and enabled
his expedition to win success through a
series of dangers that at various times
threatened to overwhelm it with total fail
ure. Hardly any more complete or devout
attribution of the credit for his achievements
to a Higher Power could be made, than the
letter in which the successful explorer
shows how the very disasters which delayed
him, worked out the successful results which
were finally achieved.
This is the more remarkable because the
character and temper of Stanley in his
earlier career were not especially marked
for devoutness. Self-reliant, determined,
wary and courageous, he has heretofore
seemed to hold the principle that Providence
helps those who help themselves. That he
has abandoned the belief in works as well as
faith is not likely; but he has never before
shown the religious spirit so prominently.
It would almost seem that as Stanley in
herited and enlarged Dr. Livingstone's
mission of opening, up the dark places of
Africa, so he has succeeded to the mission
ary explorer's earnest and constant faith.
Possibly, the spirit may have its origin in
his intercourse with Livingstone on his first
expedition, when the patient inspiration of
the older man was steadily leading him to
his lonely death in the effort to solve the
mystery of the Lualalu.
Yetin view of the fact that Stanley's com
panionship with Livingstone lasted but a
few months, and occurred many years ago,
may not this devout belief be ascribed to
the influence which surrounded the efforts
of both explorers. May there not be some
thing in the struggle with the forces of
nature, the observation of savage life, and
the pursuit of heroic efforts remote from the
centers of civilization and the competition
of "enlightened selfishness" which teaches
the ardent mind that Providence is over all,
and that hnman weakness is strongest in its
reliance on a Supreme Being?
There is certainly a strong commentary
on the efforts of philosophers who sit in
easy chairs and elaborate agnostic theories,
that men of snch heroic achievements as
Stanley and Livingstone are by the very
record of their struggles brought to a clear
belief in the existence of Divine Provi
dence. The sad news comes from New Tork that
the baby hippopotamus recently added to the
population of that city bad died because its
lanes could not stand the climate. Chicago
will not be slow to draw the moral of the obvi
ous impropriety of asking tho world to come
and enjoy an international exposition in a cli
mate that is too moist for a yoasg river hog.
The sad remark is made by she Miaseap
olis Pioneer Press with regard to" the light he
havioreC eeef the numbers of Cob ess
during the reading of the President's message:
'The disposition to treat the reading of the
message as a joke Is one of the depressing
signs of the times." In that case the most ob
vious remedy Is to avoid methods of.presenting
the message, 'which make it a Joke. It may be
disrespectful to say that the Jealous guarding
of a collection of platitudes, as II It contained
the secret of the ages, and its presentation to
Congress to be read OTallywhenitcould twice as
conveniently be understood if published to the
world on the morning of the meeting. is one of
the jokes of the day; bat there is nevertheless
more fact than Imagination In the assertion.
Solemn humbug is looked upon In the most
charitable way when taken as a joke.
The statement, on apparently good au
thority, that the WiUiamsport Flood Commis
sioners are going to allow themselves five dol
lars a day out of the relief fund, Indicates that
those officials think that the relief fond belongs
to the sufferers, and that they are the sufferers.
It is, after all, a little uncomplimentary
to oar system of justice that the one murderer
found guilty of murder in the first degree by an
Allegheny county jury these many years should
be a friendless negro.
The statement during the week that soine
purchases were made of claims against the
Lawrence Bank it the rata of CO cents on the
dollar seems to furnish an additional reason for
expediting at least a proximate official state
ment Of the assets and liabilities. If the de
positors sell their claims at less than the bank
will pan out, they will have made a losing
transaction through tholr uncertainty of the
condition of things. On the other hand, if
those who buy pay more than can be realized,
the number of losers will be increased. Thus
it is that speculation In the claims will scarcely
bring any additional satisfaction Into the situa
tion: and that an official indication of the prob
able salvage becomes doubly desirable,
"With one 250-barrel well, a 800-barrel

A COEeespondeut elsewhere pursues
the discussion as to the respective cost of living
at Philadelphia and in this city, with con
clusions to the advantage of Philadelphia, The
fact of the matter seems to be that the work
lnginen can get an equally good house and
equally good living at a slightly less cost in
Philadelphia, perhaps, for the very cogent
reason that he has considerably less wages to
pay for it withal. Bnt Pittsburg is rapidly in
creasing her supply of small homes for the
working people, and her transit facilities for
getting to them.
The railroad company which proposes to
furnish each purchaser of a ticket with an ac

Bench together are nephew and uncle, the Bos

family." Perhaps so; bnt it is also possible to
Intimate that another trait which has run in
that family is that of cultivating close relations
with the great corporate interests that take
care to give attention to the composition
of the Supreme Court.
The controversy between Governor For
aker and the un-gubernatorial Campbell grows
somewhat unprofitable. Both parties should re
ceive private advice upon the golden qualities
ot silence, especially in cases like theirs.
The announcement that Alger is mad
over the appointment of Brewer comes nearer
to a satisfactory indorsement of Brewer than
anything which preceded it.

THE TOPICAL TALEEEA
A Slip ol the Foot la n Baaaeroas Thing to
a Dancer The True History ef How
Ode Thanksgiving Dinner Felt in the
Sonp.
Chubbt and graceful Frauleln Clara Quail tz
lost her balance in one of those whirling spins
she is so fond of yesterday afternoon. It was
at the matinee performance of "Bluebeard,"
and Qualitz, in her character ot an ostrich
was ever there a sprinter of the desert so
plumpT appeared to take part in the grand
ballet divertissement. Bho started out to swing
around the stage, inclining toward its' center;
and, as she reacnea tne top or tne stage, she
tost her balance and fell. Apparently she sus
tained no hurt, and she finished her pas seul
with her remarkable smile undiminished. It Is
curious how Qualitz always can command that
smile, which shows her regular teeth so well
and makes her hardest work seem child's play
to her audience.
Once they say Qualitz humped Into a cory
phee, and their two heads came together with
a prodigious crack. Qualitz smlledsweetly and
murmured an apology, but the ballet girl cried,
as well she might, tor the blow was a hard one.
Qualitz was asked why she did not cry, and she
said; "I cry? Before the audience? No, no, I
always smile."
But 1 di not refer to the mishap ot a
premiere danseuse to get a chance to enlarge
upon her smile. What I wanted to ask my
readers or such of them as confess to seeing
a ballet now and again Is, whether they ever
realize what a dangerous thing it is to execute
a pas seul upon a crowded stage ?
That very movementln which Frauleln Qualitz
stumbled yesterday is one of the most Difficult
and dangerous a premiere executes. Whirling
around a stage at a headlong gait, the taster
the bettor, the louder the applause, the dancer
runs the risk of colliding with other people,
the wings and the proscenium arch. Some ten
years ago I saw a dancer, unable tostopher
Beltatthe right moment, fall upon the foot
lights, and she was carried from the stage a
mass of names. A bit or wood, a Chance nail,
a morsel ot tin or tinsel from the trappings of
tne ballet, any one ox tnese may trip the
premiere as she pirouettes on hei toe points,
with her eyes toward the gods and her mind
thinking of naught but the cadence of the
music and the intricate steps before her.

Two or three days ago in a Missouri lumber
camp one man chopped another to pieces with
an ax for impugning his ability as a cook. He
was the coot of the camp, and he could not
allow sneers at his culinary capabilities to pass
unremarked.
A tragedy somewhat like the above, only a
little more humorous and a trifle less ghastly,
occurred In a Pittsburg household a few days
ago. The day before Thanksgiving the late
dinner to which the family sat down was a
modest little affair, as dinners are apt to be on
the erect a festival. But its modesty shrank
out ot sight behind the atrocious cooking ot
the meal. The soup was smoked and very
greasy O think of that, soup's new-f onndproph

in tepid water, and everything that came to the
table showed signs of having passed through a
terrible ordeal In the kitchen.
You know a family wiH make remarks about
a meal that is served in this fashion. Bome of
the younger members of the circle were ex
tremely sarcastic. The girl who waited at the
table reported these allusions to the cook as
toon as possible; and there was a sound of
load talking below stairs all the evening. Bnt
nobody thought anything of that; It had oc
curred before. There was no other warning of
the impending disaster given to the devoted
family,

As materfamilias descended the stairs the
next morning, and made her way to the dining
room in how many families the mother is the
goodly example In early rising! a savory, and
yet somewhat peculiar odor saluted her nos
trils. So, Instead of entering the dining room.
She passed on downstairs to the kitchen. The
only occupant of the kitchen was the house
maid, whose appearance was enough to scare
anybody out of a year's healthy growth.
"Janet" said the ladyof the house sternly,
"Janet what is the matter T Where's Mary?"
Mary was the cook.
''Idunno, mum,' said Jane;- 'Wie've gone and
took her trunk!"
Then the inquisitor observed that a large
wash-boiler was resting on the kitchen range,
and that the fumes she had smelt upstairs were
rising from it.
"What's cooking there 7" she asked.
"I dunno," replied Jane; "Mary have gone
with her trunkf"

but energetic 3-year-old to whom his mother's
thoughts had turned with an unreasonable fore
boding more than once during that awful
quarter of an hour.
They took out a 11-pound turkey.a large roast
of beef, half a sack of potatoes, some salt cod
fish, and a pair of chickens. These were the
large items; but that boiler was found to con
tain In a half-stewed state virtually the whole
of a well-stocked larder. Who had made such
a tremendous stewT Mary, the cook. A bottle
of whisky and the remarks at the dinner table

RlcmioiO), December 7. Jefferson Davis
was known personally to a larger number of
people in Richmond than in perhaps any other
City. Citizens who Werechildren during the war
recall his regular evening ride on a gray horse,
which he sat splendidly. Dr. Charles Brock, a
prominent physician and a fine horseman, re
calls an Incident of this time. He says tharfone
evening he was riding a mare that was so
vicious that bo could do nothing with her.
While the animal was bucking on a turnolke'
near this city, Mr. Davis rode up and said:
"That is a una animal. Doctor."
The Doctor replied that he would like to see
Mr. Davis ride her. The latter said that he
would like to take a spin, and they changed
horses.
"He had no sooner taken the reins," said
the Doctor, "than with one easy poll he had
her entirely under subjection. Then he put
spurs -and rode her three miles, and I tell
you Bhe was subdued enough when he re
turned her to me. It was the finest riding I
ever saw."
Governor Fitzhugh Lee, himself a noted
horseman, says Mr. Davis was the finest horse
man, he oversaw. On one ot bis lonely rides
Mr. Davtswas fired upon by a man hid In the
bushes, the ball whistling dote to his head.
He rode bis horse straight In the direction
from which the missile came, and tbe would-be
assassin' fled, but was caugbthy some soldiers.
He proved to be a foreigner who was crazy,
and was not prosecuted.

the kindred subjects of immigration and nat
uralization. It was dne to his efforts, mainly,
that the last Congress appointed a committee
to investigate the question of immigration,
which succeeded Jn breaking up at least a part
of the padrone system, and brought at least
one of the principals to punishment:
Mr. Oates Is nowpreparing a bill to combine
the provisions contained in two bills Intro,
ducedbyhlm In the last Congress. He has
come to the conclusion that a law whose
tendency wonld be to restrict promiscuous Im
migration most also make some provision for
the proper naturalization of such lmmlnanta
as are Invited to come to these shores. He
pro poses to prevent the coming into this coun
try of any person previously convicted of
crime, and of polvgamlsts and paupen.
Immigrants, before they will be allowed to
land In the united Btates, must produce a cer-
uuMiswiuuuuiaana irom tne ..American
Consnl located nearest to their homes 3n their
native country. Then he proposes to do away
with tnat part of the present naturalization
laws which permits of a foreigner "declaring
his Intentions," antt thus obtaining the full
benefits of citizenship withont being compelled
to take out his final papers.
An Immigrant, under Mr. Oates" bill, will be
required jo have resided five full years In this
country before he can be admitted to citizen
ship. He mustgo before a Judge, satis ry that
functionary that he can speak, and read the
English languaee. and then submit proof of his
being a competent person, under the immigra
tion laws, Jo apply for citizenship. A repre
sentative or the Government will be present at
the proceedings, to watch the case on behalf of
the United States, and if need be to bring
counter-evidence against the applicant. If the
Judge is satisfied with the shoving made by
the applicant, he will issue to him a certificate
of judgment to that effect, and admit him to
the rights and privileges or citizenship.
Mr. Oates believes that by this means the
quality of Immigration to this country will be
raised, and the dlmlte- nf iitlryitiin in its
United States be enhanced.
TO HEAD OFF THE BE1TISH,
Wharton Barker Will Try to Organise an
American Syndicate.
Phh-Uelphia, December?. The apparent
Buccess which bas attended the organization ot
the London corporations to transact business
in England and the TJnited States has inspired
Wharton Barker to attempt a similar under
taking. Under date of December 4 that gen
tleman Issued type-written letters to a number
ot Phlladelphians stating that he had
associated with him a number of
influential capitalists who proposed forming a
banking and trading company under the En
glish .liability act, to conduct business in
Europe and America, and asking the gentle
man addressed to oail at his office, where the
plans will be unfolded. A number of gentle
men interviewed yesterday had a vivid recol
lection of Mr. Barker's Chinese schemes, and
tbeyhad not availed themselves of the privi
lege of getting on the ground floor ot the latest
enterprise.
The liability act to which Mr. Barker refers
limits the liability of stockholders to the
amount of stock held by each, while the liability
In this country Is for the amount of the stock'
and as mnch more. Thnnrlnr.inlftnf tho V.n.
cliih law is to limit the liability of stockholders.
very mnch as the liability of partners is re
stricted in Pennsylvania by tbe statute pro
viding for the organization of limited partner
ships. Mr. 'Barker nronoap maV a th -.-
outstrip in capltaf any financial institution In
this country. He expects to have the total
capital mopaooo, one-half of which will be
placed In England and the other half will be
offered to Americans. Offices will be estab
lished in the leading European cities, and an
advisory board will include such prominent
men In England and In New York, Philadel
phia and Chicago as may be induced to lend the
scheme their support. Barker Brothers & Co.,
of this city, are to be the principal American
agents.
IT WAB 'TOO EOT FOE HIM.
How a Would-Be Mashsr Was Pat to
Flight by a GlrL
From the New York venlng Bun.l
An ancient specimen of the genus "masher"
came into an elevated car yesterday. He was
rather threadbare but carefully brushed and
was topped off with a shiny new silk hat. With
careful observation he scanned the occupants
of the car and then sat himself down dlreotly
opposite an unusually pretty girl with her lap
full bt Christmas bundles. He smoothed his
gloves, arranged his cuffs and neoktie and
then flashed an irresistible smile at the pretty
girL She looked hastily out of the window.
By and by she turned her face again, to meet
the same breadth of smile and the eyes fixed
steadily on her face. She looked annoyed. He
looked aellghted. Her cheeks grew pink. She
had half a mind to change her seat; Then all
the bravery in ber nature mounted to her eyes.
Slowly she drew from her pocket a lorgnette,
and held it with the most deliberate Inquisitive
ness up to her eyes.;
First she scanned the top of his hat, then
slowly ohl so slowly let her gaze creep down
ward to his face with its wealth of smile, her
own never changing by the quiver Ot a muscle.
Down, down it went, with flxod and stony sure,
to the very tips of his boots. There it paused
for an instant; then began its slow upward
march, creeolng along with the same
curious deliberation, very much as
one would survey a new variety of
animal with a view to classification. When
she reached tbe smile again the glory of it was
dimmed. When she reached tbe toes they
were decidedly uneasy, and by the time She
was ready to scan his face oh her upward
sweep it looked very red and decidedly uncom
fortable. One more sweeping circuit was
made, and the discomfited "masher," mutter
ing something about tbe car's being too hot for
him, fled from the awful presence and plunged
down the stairs into the street below.
A K0TEL BUREAU.
An Idea Which a Bright Woman Made
Use of Tery Prontnbly.
From the New York Tribune.:
If some bright, clever woman wants to confer
a lasting blessing on unhappy man and at the
same, time open for herself a short road
road to fortune, let her establish a
bureau and agency for Christmas and holiday
shopping. Some place where a man may go
and say to an intelligent woman for only a
woman understands the mysterious secret of
buying Christmas presents "Here is a check
forSSO. Buy me something suitable for my
wife, my sister or my daughters."
The system might be so perfected that one
could fill in blanks as one does for a postofQce
order. Say the man goes in, fills In the amount,
the person for whom the gift is intended, the
age, tb- relationship, etc He gets a receipt
for his check and order, and at a certain time
tbe package is delivered at bis office lor his ap
proval and the collection of the commission on
the transaction.
A man Is not a Success at shopping. He gen
erally rushes into a place, nervously tosses
over a dozen or more things, buys Something in
a hurry, tears away to bis business, and gradu
ally wakens to the fact that he has not bought
the thing he wanted. There is ho patent on
this Idea, and any woman of the right kind is
heartily welcome to It

CSIMS AT THE CAPITAL --
Silcott's Misdeed Net Wltnoat Precedent
Unhealthy Ioflaences In Washlngtea IJfe
Stories of Clever Thefts Caroline
Becker's Cata Capers.
ICOBBXSrONDZSCI Or THE DISPATCH.l
Washington, D. C, December a There are
plenty of people tosay "I told you so," la re
gard to the moral lapse of Cashier Silcott, ot
the office of Sergeant at Arms of the House of
Representatives but it is probable that a sus
picion of the man's honesty never entered the
head of one of his acquaintances until tbe
scandal burst from the clear sky ot yesterday
morning. If anybody onzht to have suspected
him, it was his superior officer, his employer; In
fact. Sergeant at Arms Leedom, who knew his
habits; but it is really so common in this at
mosphere for a gentleman In office to do a little
Sporting and to have a wife sinister, that tbe
fact does not occasion anxiety. Silcott "played
the races," but so do thousands of other good
men whose income Is no more than his. Mr.
Leedom himself wat an enthusiastic patnon of
the pools, and probably lost as much money as
Silcott did, bnt he was abler to stand It and did
not have to fall back on a grand breach of
trust when he found himself getting short in
pocket.
It Is one of the astonishing features of Jbcb
cases that a man in a position of such high
pecuniary responsibility can go the lenght bra
zenly that Silcott did,and yet arouse no alarm In
the minds of those who are in a'position to suffer
from his malfeasance. It seems to have
become so'-common a thing for a man to spend
more than he makes that it excites no com
ment, and no one seems to reflect that when he
does so he must be robbing somebody. Mem
bers of Congress, citizens, fellow officials, who
were in a position talcnow the lavish expend
itures of Silcott at tbe race track and at
"Monte Carlo," officials who were hit idtimate
companions in his more reczless escapades, all
Of whom knew that he bandied money, often
more than a hundred thousand at a time, never
thought to sound a note of warning, or even to
protect themselves against probable robbery.
And now it is probable that the Congress will
Step In and make the people pay for the
negligence of members, and the blindness and
carelessness ot Silcott's employer and his fel
low officials, and thus contribute to the dead
enjoyments ot this sensational defaulter. ,
An Unhealthy Moral Atmosphere.
After all it was not the race track nor the
woman In the case that ruined Silcott It was
the atmosphere of Washington. There is some
thing in the1 social air that quickens a man's
pace. It is a city of social abandon, of Intel
lectual friction, of Intense concentration and
its opposite of extreme relaxation. Ona'sacts
are construed more liberally here than else
where within reach of the home of the Puri
tans, and men of the most dignified and cir
cumspect conduct at home are not criticised
here If they indulge in a temporary season of
dissipation. Some are made stronger morally
by snch experience, paradoxical as that may
seem, but a majority who eat of the forbidden
fruit never recover from the effects.
As long ago as my memory goes back I can
recall tbe spectacle of brilliant men wrecked
by a season of official life at this capital. Since
my earliest youth they have been always cross
ing my path. In my brief residence here I have
seen many come fresh and strong from their
own people and retire after a short time broken
to pieces by the excesses that seemed to them
to be a natural accompaniment ot the new life.
Doubtless It only proved that they were not
at all strong morally, and that It needed but op
portunity and a little encouragement to wreck
them. It is a fine Stndv for the moralist and
psychologist the ease with which the most ex
emplary men drop from their hleh moral estate
when example and opportunity are first put
forcibly before their eyes.
Several Noted Defaulters.
The defalcation of Silcott is by all odds tbe
most sensational that has occurred since the
handsome and popular Captain Howgate stole
a hundred thousand or so of the public funds.
Howgate was In jail for awhile, but one day
was kindly permitted to escape by an officer
who accompanied him to his residence to secure
a change of clothes, just as thomrb his clothing
could not have been brought to him. Though
it has alwavs been suspected that numerous
people of Washington were well aware of the
whereabouts of the Captain, and among them
members of the police, he is still at large, but
whether comfortable and happy I cannot say.
Another noted defalcation was that of Pay
master Hodges of the army, also for a large
amount Hodges was tried and convicted, and
I believe, pardoned. If I am not mistaken I
saw him on tbe street the other day, looking
well and as though In a condition of affluence.
Ben rjalleck'a Boodle.
One of the most noted robberies that ever
occurred in this city was that ot Ben Halleck,
who carried off no less than 195,000 of Treasury
money at a single load. He was a clerk in the
cash room ot tbe Treasury, and one day when
a vast amount was being loaded on an express
wagon for transportation, Ben carried this
amount in one bundle, most ot it In 1500 bills,
out and away, right under the eyes of the
clerks, watchmen and police. He passed it
along to "Peg-leg Brown," a well-known sport
ing character, who turned It over to a keeper ot
a restaurant, of which Brown was a constant
patron.
Ottman. the saloon keener, shoved some of it
and Brown skipped with the remainder, and
was caught at Saratoga while attempting to
pass one of the bills. All three were arrested,
but not until Ottman and Brown had bad a
good deal ot fun with the money, none of
which, however, was enjoyed by poor Halleck.
Caroline Becker's Cuteness.
I think it was a man named Connelly who
stole a large amount from the Redemption Di
vision ot the Treasury Department, in the
shape ot old hills turned in for redemption and
maceration; but tbe cutest affair of that kind
that has ever happened was the theft of no one
Knows how much, by Caroline Becker. This
was of recent occurrence. la the presence of
other clerks, and with only portions of bills to
operate with, Mrs. Becker pieced together
thousands of dollars without the fractions
being missed by the keenest-eyed clerks of the
entire civil service. How she managed to do it
Without discovery is one of the mysteries that
It a constant subject of wonder among tbo em
ployes of the department, and a yet daily query
Is as to the amount the woman got
Wore Diamonds While at Work.
Herdwas another case of notable blindness
on the part of the acquaintance of the mlsdoer.
Becker wore magnificent diamonds to her
dally work, which she performed for a salary
of 575 a month. She explained this by the
story that a rich aunt had died and left her tbe
gems. She bought houses worth thousands
eacb, and was erecting a fine country residence
when, oy a mere-accident one day when she
was not at work, portion ot a bill told the
story of the theft Hers will doubtless remain
for a lung time one of tbe strabgest of tbe cu
rious crimes committed in the pnblio service at
the Capital.
A Crime Sever Committed.
One of the robberies that did not take place
was that which never got any farther than tho
brain of a sensational correspondent of a sensa
tional newspaper. He had secured crows and
jimmies enough to make a formidable display,
and arranged to strew them one night In the
court ot the Treasury at a time when the exca
vation was about finished for the new silver
vaults. His plan was to place them there and
then by a series of terriflo explosions, alarm
the treasury watch and the whole city at that
time of night when none but tbe Initiated, that
is himself and bis confederates, would be about
that is, after all the other correspondents bad
gone home, when he would easily hare a
"beat" ot the attempt to rob the vaults.
A Herniation Spoiled.
On tbe day previous to that on which he In
tended to spring the sensation he was dismissed
from his papor "by telegraph" on account of a
sensation involving a Senator, which, being
without foundation, was too extreme for even
the usually inexhaustable appetites for that
sort Of thing of the editors in the home office.

Nsrw York, December 7. Tbe 1,209 passen
gers on the Btaten Island ferryboat Robert
Garrett were thrown Into a panic just off Lib
erty Island to-day by a tremendous thumping
on the floor of the cabin and clouds ot escaping
steam from the engine room. They all had
heard of tho fatal explosion on the Btaten
Island, ferryboat Korthfleld, several years ago,
and were consequently ready to do anything
rather than remain on Board. Dozens of men
dragged down life preservers from the shelves
and buckled them on, while women fainted and
children screamed; Everyone tried to get ont
of the cabin at once, and many would have
been trampled to 'death In tho crush had not
Erastus Wimau, owner of the ferry line,
quieted the craziest by bis shouted assurances
that there was no danger. An examination
sbowed that tbe cause of tbe thumping and
escape of steam was the breaking of a paddle
wheel and a slight defect of an engine. A tug
was signaled for, and after an hour's delay Mr.
Wlman's boat and Mr. Wlman and his 1,200
scared passengers were towed Into the Btaten
Island ferry h ouse.
Gambling Tools Chopped Up.
Gambling tools worth 135,000, the proceeds of
35 different police raids, were destroyed at
police headquarters to-day. At 11 o'clock Su
perintendent Murray stepped into a little ring
formed by tbe Police Commissioners, rolled up
his sleeves, grasped a heavy sledge hammer,
whirled it alolt and brought It down on an ele
gant 1800 poker table. Tnen half a dozen mem
bers of the Broadway squad, armed with bright
new axes, stepped forward and began the work
of demolition. In a moment the yard in which
the work was going on sounded like a boiler
factory in full operation. There were first
brought outa dozen roulette wheels and tables.
When these had been knocked into kindlings,
something like 80 blackboards were knocked
into a fine powder in as many seconds. By this
time the men were working on a pile of debris
three feet high. Additions were made in tbe
shape ot faro layouts and more roulette tables
and wheels. It took the police just six hours to
smash all the implements according to the re
quirements of the law.
Choked to Death On a Peanat.
Willie S. Atwood, 11 years old, was choksd to
death by a peanut In his bronchial tube.
Thursday evening he and his little sister
bought a cent's worth of peanut taffy.and ate it
in tne street, tia suddenly complained to his
sister that he could hardly breathe. He was
overtaken with a fit of coughing and a choking
sensation. Tbe little fellow was taken to Belle
vue Hospital. Tbe choking sensation steadily
increased. It was decided to perform tracheo
tomy, and an incision was made in the neck, to
the windpipe, just below tbe larnyx, through
which a rubber tube was Inserted. This enabled
tbe boy to breathe a little freer, but 'the relief
was only temporary. He died of suffocation at
3 o'clock this morning. At tbe autopsy to-day,
the kernel of a peanut was found in his" bron
chial tube.

TQBEE QEAND OLD HXMSS.
Compositions or Long Ago That Are Still
Regarded as IHodolt.
Prom tbe Sundty School Times.
Three hymns stand In the first rank of Latin
Church poems, and perhaps of all religious
lyrics tbe "Dies Iras" of Thomas a Celano, the
"Stabat Mater" of Glacopone da Todl and the
"Jesu fluids Memorla" of St Bernard. They
have certainly never been surpassed. The first
is the sublimest the second the tenderest, the
third the sweetesfhymn of the Middle Ages.
The "Dies Iris" is 'a judgment hymn, the
"Stabat Mater" a passion hymn, the "Jesu
dnlds Memorla" a Jesus hymn. All date' from
tbe ages of faith, so called, which built the
cathedrals, witnessed the crusades, produced
the systems of scholastic philosophy and theol
ogy, and, at a later stage, prepared through the
revival of letters, the way for the Reformation
and the higher modern civilization. The Middle
Ages have passed and can never be resusci
tated, but what was pure and trua and good in
any age is immortal, and "a thing of beauty Is a
joy forever."
The "Dies Inn" takes its name from its first
two words, "Day of Wrath," which are bor
rowed from the Bible, namely, tbe description
of the terrible day of judgment in Zephaniah
1, 15-16, according to the Latin version of St
Jerome, which was in universal use in Western
Christendom during the Middle Ages, as it is
still In the Roman Catholic Chnrcb. These
words Strike the keynote and should not bo
changed in a translation.
The poem Is usually traced to Thomas of
Celano, in Italy, a friend and biographer of St
Francis of Assist, and Superior of the Francis
can Convents of Cologne, Mayence, Worms and
Spires. He died in his native country In the
middle of tbo thirteenth century aboat A. D.
1260 (Ave years before the birth of Dante). This
pious monk wrote the hymn In his lonely cell
for bis own edification, without dreaming that
he would thereby edify unborn millions fn lan
guages and countries he never heard of.

steamers anchor just lnsiae the Canadian line
and send their boats into the United States
fishing grounds, where they are loaded, and re
turn to the vessels waiting for them. It Is said
that the United States customs officers in Puget

Oh the light that lies in a maiden's eyes , ,
As she meeta tbe fond stance of her lover; '.
Is brighter by far than the gleam of the its.
That shines In the darkness above her.

The bloom of the rose defying.
O'er her countenance files sa the maiden sighs,
Like tbe dream of a zephyr dying.
