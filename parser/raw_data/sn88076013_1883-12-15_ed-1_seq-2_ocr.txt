DAOKTA NEWS NOTES.
The New Bishop of Dakota.
New York, Special—Bishop W. D.
Walker, the newly-elected bishop of
Drikota, recently held service at the
Floating Bethel. He leaves very soon
for his new mission. Bishop Walker
took for his text the subject of Christ
walking upon the water. The ship in
which were his disciples was storm
tossed and sinking, when through the
storm which seemed to be their destruc
tion was seen the form of the master,
their fears were forgotten in their awe
clear and distinct came the cheering
•wor^s, "It is I, be not afraid." Thus it
is with the sailor to-day. He faces tem
pests and varie 1 terrors of the deep, yet
if he be a Christian that still, small voice
brings him hope and comfort. No class
of men so need the divine help as sailors.
What has the sailor to hope, should his
boat be wrecked? There is but one wlie
can bring him safeiy through, but he ie
always willing, Ho" urged the storm
tossed sailors to receive him into their
ship, ere it may be loo late.

4a Interesting Patent Suit.
An interesting case, involving a very in'
genious and economical device, has just
been decided by the courts, the particulars
of which will bear brief mention. Nelson
Lyon of Albany, N. Y., has recovered judg
ment of $8,447.10 besides cost and interest
against tj. T. Fisher & Co., in the United
States Circuit Coaru at Detroit, Mich., for
an infringtaent of what is known to the
trade as Lyon's Patent Metallic Heel Stiffen
er. This contrivance is eneof the most use
ful of modern inventions, and has aohieved
a remarkable sale -over three-quarters of a
million dollars worth, the testimony in the
present su showed having been disposed of
since the patent was granted, being a grand
total of 273 478 pounds, or 3,888,000 pairs.
At oh time tha Attorney General of
United SUtes declared the Lyon patent
valid, simply on account of an informality
in the application, but this was afterward
corrected by the Commissioner of Patents,
in accordance with a special act of Congress
authorizing such'correction. Fisher's main
improvement consisted in elongating the

with His Third Annual
THE PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE.
FOREIGN RELATIONS.
To the Congress of the United States: At
tbe threshold of your deliberations 1 congratu
late you upon the favorable aspect of the do
mestic and foreign affairs of this government
Our. relations with other nations continue to
be on a friendly footing. With the Argentine Re
public, Belgium, Brazil, Denmark, Italy, Santo
Domingo and Sweden and Norway, no inci
dent has occurred which calls for special com
meut. The recent opening of new lines of
telegraphic communication with Central Amer
ica and Brazil permitted the interchange of
messages of friendship with the gov
ernments of those countries'. Dur
ing the year there have teen
perfeoted and proclaimed consular and com
mercial treaties with Servia and a consular
treaty with ltoumania, thus extending our in
tercourse with the Danubian countries, while
our Eastern relations liave been placed
upon a wider basis by treaties
with Corea and Madagascar. The new
boundary survey treaties with Mexico,
a tradesmark convention and a supplementary
extradition treaty with Spain, and a convention
pxtending the duration of the Franco-American
claims (ommission, have also beon proclaimed.
Notice of the termination of the fisheries arti
cles of the treaty of Washington was duly given
Grtat Britain. The privileges and exemptions
rf the treaty will Becmingly close on July 1,
1885. The fishing industry pursued by a
numerous class of our citizens on Northern
toasts, both of the Atlantic and Pacific oceans,
are worthy of the fosteriug caro of congress.
Whenever brought tnto competition with like
industries in othor countries, our fishermen,
as well as manufacturers of fishing appliances
and preparers of fish products, havo main
tained a foremost place. I suggest that con
gress create a commission to consider the
question of our rights in the fish
eries, and the means of opening
to our citizen?,. under just and
enduring conditions, tbe richly stocked fishing
waters and sealing grounds of British
North America. A question hat arisen
touching the deportation to the United States
from the British islands, by government or
municipal aid, of persons unable there to gain
a living and equally a burden on the commun
ity here. Such of these persons who como under
the pauper class, as defined by tho law, havo
been sent back, according to tho provisions of
our statutes. Her majesty's government has
insisted that precautions havo been •taken be
ore shipment was made. However, they have
?o many eases proven ineffectual, and espe
•illy so
in certain instances of needy immigrants
ixacliing our territory through Cauada, that a
revision of our legislation upon this subject
may be deemed advisable. Correspondence
relative to the Clayton-linlwer treaty has been
continued, and will be laid before congress.
AM EHICAN POIIS.
The legislation of l'ranee against the impor
tation of prepared swino produced from tho
United States, has been repealed. That result
.las been due no less to the friendly relatiou of
this government than to a growing conviction
Franco that tho restriction is not de
manded by any real danger to health. Ger
many still prohibits the introduction of all
swine products from America I extended to
he imperial government a friendly invitation
to send experts to the United States to inquire
whether tho uso of these products was danger
ous to health. This invitation was declined.
I have believed it of such importance, how
ever, that tho exact facts should bJ ascertained
and promulgated that I have appointed a com
petent commission to make a thorough investi
gation of the subject. Its mem era have
shown their public spirit by acccpting their
trust without pledge of compensation,
hut I trust that congress will see
.n tho national and international bear
ings of tho ma'tor sufficient motives
for providing at least for the reimbursement of
such expenses as tiioy may noco3sarily incur.
The coriuation of ilie czar at Moscow afforded
to the government an occasion for testifying
to continued friendship by sending a special
envoy and a representative of tho navy to at
tend the ceremony. While there have arisen
daring the year no grave questions affecting
the st..tus in tho Russian empire of American
citizens or other faith than that held by the
notional church, this government remains firm
its convictions that tbe rights of
its cit:zons atvoad should be in no
way affected by their religious belief.
It is understood that moasuros for tho removal
of the restrictions which now burden our trade
with Cuba and Porto Bico are under consider
ation by the Spanish government The prox
imity of Cuba and the peculiar method of ad
ministration which there prevails necoesitato
constant discussion and appeal on our part
irom the proceedings of tho insular authorities.
I regret to say that just protests of this gov
ernment have not as yet produced satisfactory
results. The commission appointed to decide
cortaiu claims of our citizens against
the government after the recognition of sat
isfactory rules as to their validity was admit
ted to be illegal. Full reparation for the
injuries sustained by our citizens should be no
longer dolayed and the farco of naturalization
'u the United States as a shield to disturbers
in other countries abolished. The claims com
mission has finally adjourned. Some
o. its awards, though made more than
two years ago, have not yot been paid. Specie
payment is exueoted. Claims to a large amount
y.liich were hold by the late commission with
out its jurisdiction have been presented
to the Spanish government, as the ac
tion of the colonial law authorities
has given rise to theso claims.
The case of tho Masonic has not yet reached a
eettlemeut The Manilla court has found that
the proceedings of which this government
Las complained were authorized, and it is
hoped that the government of Spain will not
withhold the speedy reparation which its sense
of justice should impel it to offer for the un
usual severity and unjust action of its sub
ordinate colonial officer in the c$se of this
vessel. The Helvetian confederation has pro
posed the inauguration of a class of interna
tional treaties for tho deferment to arbitration
of grave questions between nations. This
government baj assented to tho proposed
inauguration of such already with Switzerland.
•Jnder tho treaty of Berlin, liberty of con
icienco and civil rights are assured t,o all
stranger* in Bulgaria. As tjio United States
have no distinct conventional relations jyith
Mat country, and are not a party to the treaty,
they should iu my opinion maintain diplomatic
representation also for the improvement of in
tercourso and the proper protection of tt
•nany American citizens who resort to that
country as missionaries and teachers. 1 sug
iest that I be given authority t) establish an
•gene and consulates at the Bulgarian capital.
The United States are now paiticirating in a
revision of tlio tariff of the Ottoman Empire,
fhoy havo absented to tho application of a
I'ouaetf.x of foreigners doing business in Tur
loy, but have opposed tho oppressive storage
tax upon petroleum entering ports of that
country, 'i'bo government of tho khediye has
proposed that the authority of the mixed judi
tribunals in Egypt be extended so as to
cover citizens of the United States accused of
crime, who are now tried before consular
courts. This government is not indisposed to
*ccept the change, but believes that its terms
should be submitted for criticism to
the commission appointed to revise the wliolo
subject
RELATIONS WITH MEXICO.
At no time in our national history has there
been more manifest need of close and lasting
relations with a neighboring State than now
exists with respect to Mexico. The rapid influx
of our capital and enterprise Into that country
shows what baa already been accomplished by
the vast reciprocal advantages which mnst
attend the progress of its internal develop
ments. The treaty of commerce and naviga
tion of 1848 has been determined by
tho Mexicau government, and in the
absence of convention engagements
tho rights of our citizens in Mexico
now depend upon the domestic statutes of that
republic. Tbere have boou iustances of harsh
enforcement of the laws against our vessels
and citizens in Mexico, and of denial of diplo
matic resort for their protection. The in
itial step toward a better uuderstading lias
bceu taken in the negotiation, by tho commis
sion authorized by congress, of a treaty which
is still before the senata for approval Tho
provisions for the reciprocal defense of tho
frontier by the troops iu pursuit of hos
tile ludians have been prolonged for
another year. The operations of tho
forces of both governments against
savages have been successful, and sovoral of
the most dangerous tribes dispersed by the skill
and valor of United States and Mexican soldiers
fighting in a common cause. The oouvention
for the resurvey of the boundary from tho
Kio Grande to tho Pacific having been ratified
and exchanged, tho preliminary reconnois
sance thereiu stipulated lia been effected. It
now rests. with congress to make provision for
completing the Burvey aud resetting the boun
dary monuments.
A convention was signo.l with Mexico on
Julj* 13, 1882, providing for the rehearing
of the case of Benjamin Weil
vs. The Abra Sylon Miuing Company, in whose
favor awards wore made by tho late American
and Mexican claims commission, That 011
vention still awaits the action of the senate.
Meanwhile, because of the charges of fraudu
lent awards which have made a new commis
sion necessary, the executive has directed the
suspension of pay of the distribution quota re
ceived from Mexico.
OUB CENTRAL AMERICAN NEIGHBORS.
Ourgoographical proximity to Central Amer
ica, and our political and commercial relations
with the seat of that countrv, justify, in my
judgment, such material increase of consular
corps as will placo at each capital a consul
general. The contest between Bolivia,
Chili and Peru have passed from tho stage of
strategic hostilities to that of negotia
tion, in which tho consuls of this government
have been cxorcised. flic demands of Chili
for absolute cession of territory bavo boon
maintained and accepted by the party of Gen.
Iglesias to the extent of concluding a treaty
of peace with the government of Chili, iu
general conformity with the terms of the pro
tocol signed in May last itwoen the Chilian
commandry and Gen. Iglesias. As a result of
the conclusion of this treaty Gen. Iglesias lias
beon formally recognizod by Chili as president
of Porn, and his government installed at Lima,
which bas been evacuated by the Chilians. A
call lias beon issued by Gen. Iglesias for a rep
resentative assembly to bo elected on the 13tli
of January, and to meet at Lima on the 1st of
March next. Meauwbile tho provisional gov
ernment of Gen. Iglesias has applied for rec
ognition to the principal powers of America
and Europe. When tho will of tbo Peruvian
people shall be manifested I shall not
hesitate to recognize the diplomatic and
representatives approved by them. Represen
tatives of this government attended at Caracas
the centennial celebration of the birth
of the illustrious Bolivar. At tho same time the
unveiling of a statue of Washington in the
Venezuelan capi'al testified to the veneration in
which his memory is held there. Congress at
its last session authorized the exeeu'.ivo to pro
pose to the Venezuelan government a reopening
of the awards of tho mixed commission of Car
acas, and the departure from this countrv of
the Venezuelan minister has delayed tho open
ing of negotiations for reviving tho commis
sion. This government holds that, until tlio
re-establishment of a treaty on this subject,
the Venezuelan government" must coutinuo to
make these payments provided for in tho
convention of 18G6. There is ground for be
lief that the dispute growing out of the un
paid obligations duo from Venezuela to Franco
will be satisfactorily adjusted. The French
cabinet has proposed a basis of settlement
which meets my approval, but as it involves a
recasting of tlio aunual quotas of the foreign
debt it has been deemed advisable to submit
the proposal to the judgements of tho cabinets
of Berlin, Copenhagen, tho Hague, London
and Madrid.
THE SANDWICH ISLANDS.
At Hie recent corouation of his majesty
King Kalakaua this government was repre
sented diplomatically and by the formal visit of a
vessel ot war. The quostion of terminating or
modifying the existing reciprocity treaty with
Hawaii is now before congress. I am con
vinced that the charges of abuso and frauds
under that treaty have been exaggerated, and I
renew the suggestions of la-st year's mesiage,
that tho treaty be modified wherever its pro
visions have proved onerous to legitimate
trade, I am not d}spos?d to favor the entire
cessation of treaty relations which havo fos
tered good will between tbo countries, aud
contributed toward the eciualitv of Hawaiian
among the nations.
GOOD WILL IN THE ORIENT.
In pursuance o( the policy deelarod
by this government of extending our inter
course with the Eastern nations, logations have
during the past year been established in Per
sia, Siam and Corea. It is probable that per
manent missions from those countries will ero
long be maintained in the United States. A
special embassy from Siam is now on its way
hither. Treaty relations with Corea wore per
fected by the exchange at Simul on the 19th of
May last of the ratification of the lately con
cluded convention, and envoys from the
king Qf Zanzibar have visited this
couutry and received a cordial wel
come. Corea, as yet unacquainted with
tho methods of Western civilization now in
vites the attentiou of those interested in the
foreign trade, as it n6eds tho implements and
products which the United Stat'.a are ready to
supply. We Beek no monopoly of its com
merce and no advantage over other nations,
but as the Chinese in reacbiug for a higher
civilization have confided in this republic, wo
cannot regard with indifference any encroach
ments on their rights.
CHINA AND THE UNITED STATES.
China, by the payment of a money indemni
ty, has settled certain of the long-pending
claims of our citizens, and I have
strong hopes that the remainder will
soon bo adjusted. Questions have arisen
touching the rights of American and other
foreign manufacturers in China, under tho
provisions qf treaties? which permit aliens to
exercise their industries in that country. Qn
this specific point our own treaty is silent
But under the operation of tho most favored
nations clause we havo liko privileges to those
of other powers. While it is tho duty of tbe
government to see that our citizens have the
full enjoyment of every benefit secured by
treaty, I doubt the expediency of lead
ing in a movement to constrain China
to admit an interpretation bv which
we have only an indirect right to exact the
transference to China of American capital.
For the employment thereof Chinese labor
would in effort inaugurate a competition for
tjje control of markets now supplied by our
home industries. There is good roason to be
lieve that the law restricting the immigra
tion of Chinese has beon violated intentionally
or otherwiBo by the officials of China npon
whom is devolved tho duty of certifying that
the emigrants belong to the excepted classes.
Measures have been taken to ascertain the
facts incident to this supposed infraction
and it is believed that the government of
Chjua yill co-operate with the United States in
securing the faithful observance of the law.
The same oonaidoraiiopg which prompted con
gress at its last session to return to Japan the
Simoneski indemnity seem to mo to require
at its hands like action in respect to the Can
ton indemnity fund, now amounting to $300,
000. Tli? question of the general revision of
tho foreign treaties of Japan has been consid
ered in an international conference held at
Tokio, but without definite result as
yet Tnis government is disposed
to conccde tbe requests of Japan to
determine its own tariff. duties, pro
vide such proper judicial tribunals as may
commend themselves to the Western powers
for the trial of causes to which foreigners are
parties, and to assimilate the terms and decla
rations of its treaties to those of other civilized
S'ates. Through our ministers at London and
Monrovia, this government has endeavored to
aid Liberia in its differences with Great Britain,
touohing tbe boundaries of that republic. There
as a prospect of the adjustment of the dispute
by tbe adoption of the Maunah river as the line.
Tnis arrangement is a compromise of tbo con
flicting territorial claims. The rich and
populous valley of tbe Congo is
being opened to commerce by a
society called tho International African asso
ciation, qf which the king of tho Belgians is
president, and a oitizen of the United States
chief executive officer, "and large tracts
of territory have been cedod to tbe association
by native chief«. Tbe objects of this association
are philanthropic. It does not aim at perma­
nent political control, but seeks the neutrality
of the valleys which have been
opened. Steamboats placed on tbe
river and the nuclei of states established
at twenty-two stations nuder one flag, which
offers freedom to commerce and prohibts the
slave trade. The United States caunot be
indifferent to this work, nor to the interest! of
their citizens involved in it. It may become
advisable for us to co-operate with other com
mercial powers in promoting the rights of
trade and residence iu the Congo valley free
from the influence or political control of any
one natiou.
In view of the frequency of invi
tations from foreign governments to partici
pate in social aud sciontic congresses
for tbo discussion of important matters
of general concern, I repeat tbe
suggestion of my last message, that provision
bo made for the exercise of discretionary power
by the executive in appointing delegates to
such conventions. Specialists a.-o ready to serve
the national interest iu such capacity, without
personal profit or othor compensation than tho
defrayment of expenses actually incurred, and
this a comparatively small annual appropria
tion wouU suffice to meet
RESTRICTIONS WON TRADE.
I have alluded in my previous message to
the injurious aud vexatious restrictions suf
fered by our trade in the Spanish West Iudies.
Brazil, whose natural outlet for its great
national trade in coffee is in and
through tho United State, imposes
a heavy export duty upon that product. A
like narrow policy is pursued in other Ameri
can countries. Our petroleum exports are
hampered in Turkey and in other Eastern
ports by restrictions as to storage, aud by
onerous taxation. Tho freo outward movement
of our great food product is in somo quarters
cloggod with like impediments. For these mis
chiefs adequate relief is not always provided
by recipracitv treaties like that with Hawaii
or that lately negotiated with Mcxico, and now
awaiting the action of the senate.
It is advisable to provide some
measure of equitable relation with
the governments which discriminate
against our own. If, for example, tho execu
tive were empowered to apply to Spanish ves
sels from Cuba and Porta "Itico the same rules
of trcatiuont and scales of prices for technical
faults which are applied to our vessels and
cargoes in the Antilles, a resort to that course
might not be barren of good results. A dis
cretionary authority to forbid tho importation
of articles of consumption injurious to health
might be advantageously exercised in our deal
ing with countries that discriminate against our
food products.

If tbo revenues for tho fiscal year which will
end on June 30, 1885, be estimated upon the
bans of existing laws, tbo secrotary is of the
opinion that for that year the receipts will ex
ceed by $00,000,000 the ordinary expendi
tures, including the amount devoted to tho
sinking fund. Hitherto tho BUI plus, as rapid
ly as it has accumulated, bas been devoted to
tbe reduction of tbe national debt As a result,
tbe only bODds now outstanding which are re
deemable at the pleasure of tbe government are
payable until 1891 and 1907 respectively. If
the surplus shall hereafter bo as large as the
treasury estimates now indicate, the 3 per cent
bonds may all be redeemed at least four years
bofore any of the 4^ per cents can be called
in. The latter at tbe same rate of accumula
tion of surplna oau be paid at matur
ity, and the moneys requisite for
the redemption of the 4 per cents will
be in tbe treasury long before these obligations
become payable There are cogent reason*,
however, why the national indebtedness should
not be thus rapidly extinguished. Chief
among them is tho fact that onlv by excessive
taxation is such rapidity attainable.
REDUCING TBS REVENUE.
In a communication to congress at its last
session I recommended that all excise be abol
ished except tho9e relating to distilled spirits,
and that a substantial rednotion also be made
in the reveuues from customs. A statute has
since been enacted by which the aunual tax
and tariff receipts of the government
have been cut down to the extent
of at least fifty or sixty millions of dollars.
While I have no doubt that still further reduc
tions may bo wisely made, I do not advise ilie
adoption at thif. session of a'iy measures for a
largo diminution of the national revenues.
The results of the legislation of last session of
congress have uot as yet become sufficiently
apparent to justify any radical revision or
sweeping modifications of existing law. Iu the
iuterval which must clause before the effects
of the act of March 3, 1883, can bo definitely
ascortained, a portion, at least, of this surplus
revenues may bo wisely applied to the long
neglected duty of rehabilitating our navy and
providing defenses for tbe protection of our
harbors. This is a matter to which 1 shall
again advert. Immediately associated with the
financial subjects just discussed is ilie import
ant question, Whac legislation is needed' re
garding the natioual currency? Tho aggregate
amouut of bouds now on deposit in the treas
ury to support tho natioual bank circulation is
about $350,000,000 nearly $200,000,000
of this amouut consists of 3 par ceuts, wliirtt,
as already stated, are payable at the
pleasure of the government, aud are likely to
be called in withiu legs than four years, unless
meantime tho surplus revenues "shall be di
minished. The prnbablo effect of such an
extensive retirement of the securities which
are the basis of the national bank circulatiou
would be such a contraction of tho volume of
the currency as to produce gravo commercial
embarrassment. How can tho danger be obvi
ated? The most effectual plan, and ouo
whoso adoption at the earliest practical
opportunity I shall heartily approve, has
already beon indicated. If the reve
nues of tho noxt four years shall
kept substantially commensurate with the ex
penses, the volume of circulation will not be
likely to suffer auy material disturbance but
if, on the other hand, there shall be great
delay in reducing taxation, it will become
necessary either to substitute some other form
of currency in place of the national bank notes,
or to mako important changes in tbe laws by
which their circulation iu now controlled. In
myjudgment tho latter course is far preferable.
I commend to your attention the very
interesting and thoughtful suggestions
on this subject which appear iu
the secretary's report. Tho objections which
he urges against the acceptance of any other
securities than the obligations of the govern
ment itself as a foundation for natioual bank
circulation seem to me insuporable. For ed
verting the threatened contraction, two courses
have been suggested, either of which is prob
ably feasible. One is the issuance of new
bonds, having many years to run, bearing a
low rate ol: interest "and exchangeable upon
specified terms for those nowoutstaud ng. The
other course, which commends itself to my
own judgment as tho better, is the enactment
of a law repealing the tax ou circulation
and permitting baulks to isstio notes
for an amountequal to OOpor cent of tbe mar
ket value, instead of, as now, the face value of
deposited bonds. I agree with the secretary in
the belief that tho adoption of this plan will
afford the necessary relief.
TNE TRADE DOLL.VR.
The trade dollar was coined for tlio purposes
of trade in countries where silver passed at its
value, ascertained by its weight and finness.
It never bad a legal teuder quality. Largo
numbers of these coins entered, how
ever, into tbe volume of our currency
by common consent Their circulation in
domestic trade lias now ceased, and they havo
become a disturbing element. They should
not longer be permitted to embarrass our cur
rency system. I recommend that provision for
their reception by tho treasury and mints as
bullion at a small percentage above tho cur
rent market prices of silver of like fineness.
CUSTOMS DISTRICTS.
The secretary of the treasury advises a com
bination of certain of the customs districts
of the cou: try, and BUggosts that the president
be vested with such power in relation thereto
as is now given him in respeot to collec
tors of internal revenue by t-'oc.
3131 of the rovised statutes. The
statistics on this subjoct, which are
contained in his report, furnish of themselves
a strong argument in defense of his vio-,v.*. At
the adjournment of congress tho number of
internal revenue collection districts was 12tJ.
By executive orders dated June 25, 1883, I
directed that certain of those districts be con
solidated. The result has been a reduction of
one-third their number, which at present is but
eighty-tbree.
WAR AND THE NAVY.
TUB INDIANS MOSTLY QUIET.
From the report of the secretary of war it
will be seen that in only a single instance has
thero been any disturbance of the quiet condi
tion of our Indian tribes. A raid was made
from Mexico into Arizona by a small party of
Indians, which was pursued by Gen. cYool:
into the mountainous regions from which it
had come. It is coufident'y hoped that serious
outbreaks will not again occur, and that the
Indian tribes which have for many yeara dis
turbed tho West will hereafter romain iu
peaccablo submission.
STATE MILITIA ENCOURAGED.
On several occasions during the past year
officers of the army havo, at the request of
State authorities, visited these military on
campments for inspection of troops. From
the reports of those ofiici-rs I am mdnced to
believe that the encouragement of the State
militia organization by tho National govern
ment would be followed by very gratifying re
sults and would afford it, in sudden emer
gencies, tho aid of a large body of volunteers
educated in the performance of military du
ties.
AN EXPOSED SEACOAST.
I again call your attention to the present
condition of our extended seacoast, upon which
are BO many largo cities whose wealth and im
portance to the country would, in
time of war, invit3 attack from mod
ern armored ships, against which our
existing defensive woi'ks cou'd give no ade
quate protection. Those works were built be
fore the introduction of modern heavy rifled
guns into maritime warfare aud if thoy aro
not jut iu an efficient condition, we may easily
be subjected to humiliation by a hostile power
greatly inferior to ourselves. As germane to
this subject, I call your attention to the im
portance of pert c'iug our submarine torpedo
defenses.
The board authorized by the last con
gress to report on the methods for the
manufacture of heavy ordnance, and
adapted to modern warfare, has vis
ited tho principal iron aud steel works
in this country aud iu Europe. It is hoperl that
its report will be soon made, and that congress
will thoreupon bo disposed to provide suitable
facilities and plans for the manufacture of
such guns as are now imperatively needed.
The secretary of tho navy reports that, uuder
the authority of the acts of Aug. 5, 1882, and
March 3, 1883, the work of strengthening our
navy by the construction of modern vessels has
been auspiciously begun. Three cruisers aru
in progress of construction—the Chicago, of
4,500 tons displacement, and the Boston and
Atlantio, each of 2,000 tons. They are to be
built of stec-1, with tbo tensile strength and
ductility prescribed by law, and in combination
of speed, endurance, and armament are ex
pected to compare favorably with the best un
armed war veesels of other nations.
A fourth vocsel, the Dolphin, to
be constructed of similar materials,
is intended to serve as a fleet dispatch boat-'
Tbo double-turretcd monitors Puritan, Amphi.
trite and Terror have been launched' on the
Delaware river, and a contract' has been made
for the supply of their machinery. A similar
vessel, the Mouadnock, has been launched in
California. The naval advisory board and the
secretary recommend tho completion of tbe
monitors, tho construction of four gunboats,
and also of three steel vossels like the Chicago,
Boston and Dolphin, as an important u^asuro
of material defense.
INTERIOR WATERWAYS.
The secretary urges the immediate creation
of an interior fast line of water ways
across tbo peninsula of Florida, along the coast
from Florida to Hampton lloads, between the
Chesapeake bay and Delaware river, $nd
through Cape Cod. I feel bound to impress
upon tbe attention of ccugross the necessity of
continued progress in the construction of the
nayy. The condition of the publio treasury,
as I have already intimated, makes tbe pres
ent au auspicious time for putting this branch
of the service in a state of efficiency. It is
part of our policy to oreate aud maintain a
navy able to cope with that of tbe
other great powers of the world.
We have no wish for forcigr lonqucst^ and the
foeming
ieace whioh wo have so lon(, enjoyed is in no
danger of interruption yet our naval
strength should be made adequate for {he de
fense of our harbors, the protection of our
commercial interests, and the maintenance of
our national honor—a proposition from which
no patriotic citizen can withhold his asaen^
IS POSTOJFICE AFFAIRS.
A PBOUBINA STATE OF FINANCES.
The report of the postmaster general oon
tains a gratifying exhibit of the condition and
prospeota of this interesting branch of the
publio servioe committed to bis care. It ap-
Ser
eal's that on June 30, 1883, tha whole num.
or postoffices was 47,803, of which 632
were established during the previous fiscal
year. The number of offices operating under
the system of free delivery was 154. At these
latter offices the postage on local matter
amounted to $4,195,230.52, a sum exceeding
by $1,021,894.01 tho entire cost of the
carriers' service in the country. The
rate of postage on drop letters passing
through these offices is now fixed by law ac
two cents per balf ounoe or fraction thereof.
In offices where the carrier system has not
been abolished the rate is only half as large.
It will be remembered that* in 1803, when
free delivery was first established by law, the
uniform single rate of postage upon local let
ters was ono cent, and so it remained until
1872. when in those cities where carrier serv
ice was established it was increased to dofray
tho expense of such service. It seems to
mo that the old rate may now .with pro
priety be restored, and that, too, even
at a risk of diminishing for a time, at least, re
ceipts from postage upon local letters. I can
see no reason why that particular class of mail
matter should be held accountable for the en
tire cost of not only its own collection and de
livery but the collection and delivery of all
other classes, aud I am confident, after full
consideration of the subject, that the re
duction of the rate would be followed by such
a growing volume of business as to occasion
but slight aud temporary loss to the revenue
of the postoffice.
POSTAL TELEGRAPH NOT DESIRED.
The postmaster general devotes much of
his report to the consideration in its various
aspects of the relatiou of the government to
the telegraph. Such reflection as I have been
able to give the subject since my last annual
message has not led me to change tne view
which I then expressed, in dissenting from the
recommendation of tho postmaster general,
that tho governmeut assume the same control
over tho telegraph which it has always ex
ercised over the mails. Admitting that its au
thority in the premises bo as ample as has ever
been claimed for it, it would not, in
my judgment, be a wise nse
of that authority to purchase or assume the
control of existing telegraph linos, or to con
struct others with a view of entering into gen
eral competition with private enterprise. The
objections which may be justly urged against
either of those projects aud, iudced, agaiust
any system which would require an enormous
increase in the civil service, do not, however
apply to some of the plans which have lately
provoked public comment and discussion. It
ha,s been claimed, for example, that congress
might wisely authorize the postmaster general
to contract with eomo private persou or
corporation for the transmission of messages
at specified ratos and under government
supervision. Various such schemos, of tbe
same general nature but widely differing in
their special characteristics, havo heen sug
gested in the publio prints, and the arguments
by which they havo been supported and op
posed have doubtless attracted your attention.
It is likely that the whole subject will be con
sidered by you at the present session. In the
nature of things it involves so mauy questions
or detail that your d3liberations would prob
ably be aided slightly, if at all, by any par
ticular suggestions which I might now submit.
I avow my belief, however, that the govern
meut should bo authorized by law to exercisc
court supervision over interstate telegraph
communication, and I express the hope that
for attaining that end some measure be devised
which will receive your approbation.
DEPABTMENT OF JUSTICE.
REGULATION OP FEES.
The attorney general criticizes iu his report
the provisions of the existing law fixing the
fees of jurors and witnesses iu the federal
courts. The provisions are chiefly contained
iu the aot of February 26, 1853, though some
of them were introduced into the ait
from statutos which had been passed
manv years previous. It is mani
fest that guoh compensation as might,
when these laws were enaotod, have
been just and reasonable, would in mauy in
stances bo justly remanded at the present day
as iuadequate. I ooncur with the attoruey gen
eral in tbe belief that the statutes should be
revised by whioh theso fees are regulated. So,
too, should bo the laws to regulate the com
pensation of district attorneys and marshals.
They should bo paid wholly by salary, instead
of in part by fees, as iB now the case. The
change would prove to be a measure of econ
omy, and would discourage the institution of
needless and oppressive legal proceedings,
which it is to be feared have in some instances
been conducted for the mere Bake of personal
gain.
INTERIOR DEPARTMENT.
EVILS TO BE REMEDIED.
Much interest and varied information is con
tained in tho report of the seoretary of the
interior. I particularly call your attention to
his presentation of certain phases of the
Indian question, to his recommendations for
the repeal of the pre-emption and timber cul
ture acts and far more stringent legislation to
prevout frauds under the pension laws. The
statutes which prescribe tho definition and pun
ishments of crimes pertaining to pensions, could
doubtless bo made more effective by certain
amendments and additions, which are pointed
out in the secretary's report 1 have previ
ously referred to the alarming state of illiter
acy in certain portions of the oouutry, and
again submit for the consideration of congress
whether some federal aid should not be extended
to publio primary education wherever ade
quate provision therefor has not already been
made.
UTAH.
The Utah commission bas submitted to the
secretary of the interior its sccond annual re
port As a result of its labors supervising
the recent election in that Territory, pur
suant to the act of March 22, 1882,
it appears that the persons by that act
disqualified, to the number of about 12,000,
were excluded from the polls. This fact, how
ever, affords little cause for congratulation,
and I fear that it ia far from indicating onv
real and substantial progress toward the extir
pation of polygamy. All of the members of
the legislature are Mormons. There is grave
reason to believe that they are in sympathy
with the practices that this government is seek
ing to suppress, and that Pa effort in that re
gard will bo more likely to encounter their
opposition than receive their encouragement
and support Even if tnis view should
happily ho erroneous, the law uuder
which the commissioners have been acting,
should be made more effective by the incorpor
ation of some such measures as they recom
mend and as were included in bill No. 2,238
on the calendar of the senate at its last session.
I am convinced that polygamy is so strongly
intronched in the Territory of Utah that it is
profitless to attack with the state weapons
which constitutional legislation provide. I fa
vor, therefore, the repeal of the act upon whioh
the governmeut depends, the assumption by the
national legislature of entire political control
of the Territory and the establishment of a
commission with suoh powers aud duties as
shall be delegated to it by law.
THE DEPARTMENT OP AGRICULTURE
is accomplishing much in tbe direction of tbe
agricultural development of the country, and
the report of the commissioner giving
the results of bis investigations
and experiments, will be found inter
esting and valuable. At his instance a
convention of tho»e interested iii the cattle in
dustry of the country was lately held at
Chicago. The prevalence of pleuro-pneu
monia and other contagious diseases of ani
mals was one of the chief topics of dis
cussion. A committee of the convention
will invite your co-operation in investigat
ing the causes of these diseases, aud pro.
viding methods for their prevention and cure
I trust that congress wiU not fail at its present
session to put Alas'sa under the protection of
laws. Its people have repeatedly remonstrated
against our neglect to afford them the main
tenance aud protection expree&lv guaranteed by
tbo terms of the treaty, wherebv that territory
was ceded to t!je United States. For aixteei

Complaints have lately been numerous and
Urgent that certain corporations controlling in
Whole or part the facilities for the intec-atata
carriage of merchandise by tbe great railway
of the couutry hara resorted in their dealings
wifi tbe publio to divers measures Unjust
and oppressive in their character. In some
instances the State governments have attacked
and suppressed theso evils, but in
others they have been unablo to af
ford adequate relief beoauso of thl
jurisdictional limitations which are impose!
upon ihem by the federal constitution. The
question whether the national government may
lawfully interfere in the premises, and what,
if any, supervision of control it ought to exer
oise, ia one which merits your careful consid
eration. Whilo we cannot fail to recog
nize tbe importance of the vast, rail
way systems of the country, and their
great and beneficial influence upon tha
development of our material wealth. We
should, on the otlier band, remember that nt
individual corporation ought to be invested
with absolute power over the interest of any
other citizen or class ot citizens. The right of
those railway corporations to any profitablo re
turn upon their investment and to reasonable
freedom in tbeir regulations must be
recognized, but it seems only just that, so far
as its constitutional authority will permit, con
gress should protect people* at large in their
interstate traffic against an act of injustice
which State governments are powerless to
prevent
FOREST PRESERVES.
In my last annual message I called attention
to the necessity of protecting bv suitable legis
lation the forests situated upon the public do
main. In many portions of the West the pur
suit of general agriculture is only made prac
ticable by resort to irrigation. While success
ful irrigation would be impossible without the
aid afforded by forests in contributing to the
regularity and constancy of the supply of
water. During the past year severe suffering
and great loss of property havo been occa
sioned by profuse floods, followed by periods
of unusually low water in many of tho great
rivers of the country these irregularities were,
in great measure, caused by tha removal from
about the sources of the streams iu question
of the timber by which the wator supply had
been nourished and protected. The preserva
tion of such portions of the forests on the na
tional domain as essentially contribute to the
equable flow of importaut water courses is of
the highest consequence. Important tributaries
of the Missouri, tne Columbia and the Sas
katchewan, rise in tlie mountains of Montana,
now the northern boundary of the United
States, between the Blackfeet and Flathead In
dian reservations. This region is unsuitable for
settlement, but upon the rivers which flow from
it, depends in the future the agricultural
development of a vast tract of country. The
attention of congress is called to tbe necessity
of withdrawing from the public sale this part
of the public domain, and establishing there a
forest preserve.
INDUSTRIAL EXHIBITIONS.
The industrial exhibitions which have been
held in tho United States during the present
year attracted the attention of many foreign
countries, where the announcement of those
enterprises had been made publio through tha
foreign representatives of this government
The Southern exhibits at Louisville were
largely attended by the exhibitors of foreign
countries, notwithstanding tbe absence of
any professional characttu'iu those undertak.
ings. The centennial exposition to be held
next year at New Orleans, in commemoration
of the century of the first shipment of eottou
from a port of the United States, bids fair ta
meet with like gratifying success. Under the
act of congress of the 10th of February, 1883.
declaring that exposition to be national
and international in its character,
tbe foreign governments with which tho
United States maintaius relations, have been
invited to participate. Tho promotors of this
important undertaldng have already received
assurances of the lively interest it has excited
abroad.
The report of tbe commissioner of
tho District of Columbia is herewith trans
mitted. I ask for it your careful attention, es
pecially for those portions which relate to as
sements for taxes and water supply.
TIIE CIVIL SERVICE.
WORKINGS OP THE LAW.
The commissioners appointed lender the act
of Jan. 16, 1883, entitled "AP. act to regulate
and improve the civil service of tho United
States," entered promptly upon the discharge
of their duties. A serise of rules framed in ac
cordance with the spirit of tho statute
was approved and promulgated by tho
president In some particulars where
iu they seemed defective those
rules were subsequently amended. It will ba
perceived that they discountenanced any polit
ical or religious teats for admission to the
offloes of the public sorvice to which the statute
relates. The statute related in its original form
to the classified clerkships in the several exec
utive departments at Washington, numbering
about 5,600, and to similar positions in the
customs districts and postoffices whero as
many as fifty persons aro employed. A classi
fication of these positions, analogous to that ex
isting in the Washington offices, was duly mad©
before the law went into effect. Eleven customs
districts and twenty-three postofiicos were,
thus brought under tbe immediate operation
of tho statute. The annual report of the civil
service commission, whioh will soon bo submit*
ted to congrcss, will doubtless afford the meas
ure of a more definite judgment than 1 am now
prepared to express as to the merits of tho new
System. I am persuaded that its effects liava
thus far proved beneficial Its practicable
methods appear to bo adequate for the cuds
proposed, and thero has been no serious diffi
culty in oarrying them into effect Since the
10th of July last no person, BO far as I am
aware, has been appointed to the public serv
ice in tho classified portions thereof at any of
the departments or at any of the poatoftices
and customs districts above named, except,
thoso certified by tho commission to be compe
tent in tbe basis of the examination held irk
sonformity to rules.

At tho time when the present executive en
tered upon his office, his death, removal, resig
nation or inability to discharge his duties would
have left the government without a constitu
tional head It is possible, of course,
that a similar contingency may again
arise, unless tho wisdom of congress
shall provide against its reoarreneo. Tho sen
ate, at its last session, after full consideration,
passed an act relating to this subject which will
now, I trust, commend itself to the approval of
both bouses of congress. The clauses of tho
constitution, upon which must depend any law
regulating the presidential succession, presents
also for solution other questions of para
mount importance. These questions relate to
the proper interpretation of the phrase "ina
bility to discharge the powers and duties of the
said office" Our law providing, that when
the president shall suffer from such
inability, the presidential office shall devolve,
upon the vice president who must himself, un
der the circumstances, give place to suoh offer
as congress may by law appoint to act as:
presidont I need not here set forth numerous
and interesting inquiries which are suggested
by these words of tho constitution. They were
fully stated in my first oommuuication to con
gress, and have siaoe been the subject of fre
quent deliberations in that body. It is greatly
to be hoped that these momeutuous questions
will find speedy solution, lest an emergency
should arise when longer delay will be impos
sible, and any determination, albeit the wisest
may furnish cause for anxiety and alarm. For
the reasons fully stated in my last annual
message, 1 repeat my recommendation
that congress propose an amendment to that
provision of the constitution whioh prescribed
that the formalities for the enactment of laws*,

tion of publio moneys, the exeontive may
