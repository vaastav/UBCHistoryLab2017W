Not a Self-Executing Doctrine.
At the Worcester, Mass., conference on
the European war Professor All*ert Both?
nell Hart laid rude hands on a pet Ameri?
can superstition. That superstition con?
cerns the Monroe Doctrine. The Monroe
Doctrine has persisted bo long without
serious challenge from any quarter that
most Americans have come to believe that
it is pelf--.ust;..it big rand se'.f enforcing.
D has bata treated us a dogma with a
Bort of international uanction?one that
the nations of Europe have tacitly ac-l
cepted. BecauBa it has had behind it the:
moral rapport of the United States and the i
?elf-Interested approval of the other Amer?
ican republics it has been Bupposed to
maintain Itself of its own strength.
Under the Monroe Doctrina the United
States frankly assumed the role of guar?
dian and guarantor of the territorial in?
tegrity of all the other nations In the two
Americas. Even the consent of the other
nations to this guardianship was not
deemed essential. In the Venezuela bound
ary dispute with Great Britain Secretary
Olney announce?! that the fiat of the
I'nited State? was law in the W<
world. That was a bltmt way of putting
But what Mr. (>'.:,cy said was un?
doubtedly a true interpretation o? the
doctrine from our point of view.
What Americans have not sufficiently
r?*alized is that the respect paid by Europe
to the MonnM Doctrine was due not to Its
validity as a general principle but to a1
favoring deadlock of European interests.
The balance of power in Europe was the!
bulwark of Monroeism, (ireat Britain,
the largest holder of colonies and posses?
sions in America, was satisfied to see the
?tatito quo maintained and un willing to
permit aggressions on the part of rival
European powers. It was the British navy
more than any other on? factor which sus?
tained the policy of America for the Amer?
icans which Canning, a British statesman.
had originated after the Spanish-Ameri?
can colonies were lost to Spain.
The outcome of the European war may
dissolve the old balance ?if power. It may;
force the countries which lose most in thai
new deal to look for compensations In j
South America. It may bring those coun-j
tries who profit most by the new* <l??al to
view leniently atteinpts OB the part of the
losers to realize those compensations. In
that case the United States would quickly
find that the moral force behind the Mon?
roe Doctrine, hitherto sufficient to uphold
It, would have to be replaced by physical
force. If we are going to insist that our
flat is law in the Htm World we shall have
to put behind that fiat the power of an
adequate army and an adequate navy.
Professor Hart was therefore only
echoing the demands of practical states?
manship when he said: "Tin* Monroe Doc
trine as a collection of phrase? expressing
the pr?f?rer.ces of the United States has
lost its magic effect. Unlesj the doctrine
is a fixed policy of a great nation, backed
up by sufficient force to make it respected.
it Is simply a dream."
In his recent message President Wilson
failed to bring out our absolute dependence
on military preparedness for the mainten?
ance of the Monroe Doctrine. If we are
going to continue our r?le of guardianship
to the other American republics we must
have an army and a navy large enough to
protect their territory as well as to defend
our own ?shores. A half-trained "citizen?
ry" force will be unequal to either task.
Nor will a navy trailing behind European
navies be equal to it.
The results of the European war will
compel us to become an armed nation,
whether we like the idea or not. The
sooner we begin to accept this situation
the better. Monroe and Adams had the
courage to proclaim the Monroe Doctrine
when the United ?States was a weak power,
without the military resources to make
such a declaration good. Wo have the
necessary military rwooreil row. Shall
we shrink from developing and using them
with the fame high courage and in the
same spirit of farming Itatl ?manship as
were manifested by Adams and Monroe?

A Foolish Fiction Disposed Of.
An addie?- lately delivered before the
Austrian Geographical Society by Dr.
Schott, of Hamburg, may probably be
taken a.? marking the Official abandonment
of a fiction that has been cherished by the
German people these many months with
wonderful faith and simplicity.
It is true that confidence ?n (?crinan

Reventlow are discredited, bul occasional
announcement! of an official or semi?
official kind led the credulous to believe
that the German fleei wai roaming the
North Sea, eagerly seeking an encountet
with t ht enemy. Mr. von Wiegand'i en?
tertaining conversations with German
commanders, were good examples of the
kind of nonsense published to keep up the
'spirits of those who were a little di.?ap
pointe?! at the impotence of the German
navy.
Dr. Schott spoke plainly. He explained
that German shipping could not emerge
from what he called the Bmi Heligoland
Sylt triangle. To pass through the Straits
of Dover wa9 obviously impossible, and
the northern passage from the North Sea.

Holes in the Income Tax Net.
Secretary IfcAdoo ha= twlca admitted
the failure of the collection-at-the-source
provision of the income tax law. \, hy
should Congress stick any longer to a
method which has proved a disappointment
to the Treasury, and which, in addition,
imposes a needless burden on corporations
and other large employers?
The plan of passing over to emp:.
concerns at.d to the hanks which eash bond
coupons the labor of collecting and turning
over to Um Treasury inCOfM taxes owed
by employes ami depositors was one of
Representative Hull's felicitous inventions.
He thought that it was an ingenious way
of getting government work done at pri?
vate expense. But it didn't turn out that
way. Secretary McAdoo say.? that a much
larger revenue could he collected if the
withhoiin.g-at-the-souice method were dis?
carded and full responsibility for return
and payment wer? put on each individual
taxpayer. The single exception would be
the taxpayer living abroad, whose return
cannot he verified by Treasury agents.
If the law merely required every em?
ployer to furnish the Treasury with infor?
mation as to the amounts paid to employes
in excess of the income tax exemption, and
tank? to furnish similar information ;-.- t i
no-it- of bond coupons, the law
eould undoubted!1 be enforce?) more
eessfull) than it is enforced now. What is
needed i- lo bring home to the average
recipia t of a taxable income the necessity
of filing a true and complete return. In?
come tax dodgers are still very numerous;
for, according to the last report of the
Commissioner of Internal Revenue, there
were only 82,754 persons in the United
States with net incomes of from $.1,000
to $4,000. This is a manifestly inadequate
total, since the number with income** be?
tween $1.000 and $5,000 was 66,625, and
the number with incomes between S?.000
and |10,000 was 127,448.
Another loophole in the law is its failure
to require the return of every gross income
i; exeesi of |3,000, with the deductions on
which the maker of the return relies to
force the net income under $8,000. Now
inybody may make hit own deduction- and
refuse to lile a statement on the ground
lhat hi.? net income is below $8.000.
It is evident that thousand? and thou
tands are nol paying who should pay?
?specially in the $8,000 to $4,000 and
??i.iiiMi to .'."..ooo ,-!.,. ,._. Congress should
-.mend the law so as to make its adminis?
tration at one? more equitable and more
efficient.
