;.'THE PRESIDENTS MESSAGE.
Remarkable Increase in
Country's Wealth.
the
GREATER PROSPERITY THAN EVER.
The Fresfdent Eulogizes the
Protection Tarift System.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Dec. 0.
President Harrison's annual mes-
1&, sago wos read to congress today.
' The president begins with a state
ment that the people of the United
States are now en joying greater
' prosperity than ever before and
i deals largely with statistics to show
i this is the caso. He says in part:
. The total wealth of the country in
1800 was $17,158,610,068. In 1890 it
amounted to $02,010,000,000 an in
crease of 287 per cent. The offlclul
rotiirnn nt tlin eleventh CBDBUB and
those of the tenth for 76 leading
citieB furnished the basis of the fol
lowing comparisen: In 1880 the
capital invested in manufacturing
was $1,232,830,070; In 1800, $2,000,
735,884. In 1880 the 'number of
employes was 1,801,888. In 1880
the wages earned were $601,005,778;
in 1890, $1,221, 170,454- In 1880 the
value of product was $2,711,670,090;
in 1890, $4,860,280,837.
RAVINOS HANKS
Another indication of the general
prosperity of the country is iounu in
. . . , ...
the fact that deposits in the sayings
- banks Increased from $104,277,375 in
I860 to $1,023,070,749 in 1891, After
presenting these statistics the presl
1 ilont savs: There never has been
., ... ' i.iaw h.n wnrk was
8o abundant or when wages were as
high, It Is true that the market
price of wheat and corn, have been
low. It is one of tho unfavorable
incidents of agriculture that the
farmer cannot produco upon orders
He must sow and reap In ignorance
of the aggregate production of the
year and is peculiarly subject to the
disposition which followa over-pro-ductlor
But while tho fact I have
3tated is true as to the crops I have
mentioned, tho general averages of
prices has been such as to give to
agriculture a fair participation in
general prosperity. Tho value- of
our total farm products has increased
j from $1,303,040,860 in 1860 to ?4,V
500,000,000 in 1891. If any are dis
contented with their state here, If
any bellovo that the wages or prices,
the returns for honest toil aro inade
quate they should not fall to remem
ber that there Is no other couutry
in the world whero tho conditions
that seem to them hard would not
ho accepted as highly prosperous.
The English agriculturist would be
glad to exchange tho returns of his
labor for those of tho Amorlcan
farmer and tho Manchester work
men their wages for thoso of their
fellows at Fall River. I bellovo that
tho protectlvo system which now
for something like thirty years has
prevailed In our legislation hns been
a mighty lustruinout for tho de
velopment of our national wealth
and a moat powerful auenoy lu pro
tecting tho homes of our working
men from tho invasion of want.
TUB TARIFF.
Tho president assumes that the
recent election means tho introduc
tion of a uow policy of n tarlfl for
revenue and recommonds that tho
subject bo referred to tho uext con
grew. Ho argues the Republican
position at length, and sets forth the
1 Advantages of protection to the
wag -earner.
A FINK HECOUD.

11,414,070,202.28 have been collected

ties arrangements for a free favored

has been taken to secure markets

NICARAGUA CANAL.
Of Nicaragua canal, he says: It
is impossible to overstate the value
from every standpoint of this great
enterprise, and I hope that there
may be time given in this congress
to give to it an impetus that will in
sure the early completion of the
canal.
KKKB SILVEK.
In reference to the international
monetary conference assserabled at
Brussels, the, president says: "I
have expressed belief, that the free
coinage of silver upon agreed inter
national ratio, would probably pro
mote the interest of our people in
equality with those of the otliur na
tious
It is too early to predict
what results may be accomplishid

FINANCE
The public debt has been reduced
since Murch 4, 1889, ?259,074,200,aud
tho annual interest charges $11,084,
469. There have been paid out for
-pensions during this administration
up to Nov. 1-, 1892, ?432,504,178 Un-
jfler tue existing ianu up iu m-a-ui-ber
1st, about $93,000,000 pf revenue,
which would have been col-
Ucted upon imported sugars, if the
duty had been maintained, hns gone
into tho pockets of tho people and
not into tho public treasury as Le-
fore.
The messago concludes by saying:
"This brief exhibit of the growth and
prosperity of tho couutry will give
us a level from which to note the
increase or decadence that new legis
lative policies may bring to us.
There is no reason why national In
flueuce,power and prosperity should
not obsorvo the same rates of in
crease that havo characterised tho
past thirty years."

PROTECTING OUR INTERESTS.
War Vessals on the Lakes. Order
to bo Restored at Samoa.
Washington, Dec. 0. An inter
e ting document on the subject Of
war vessels on the lakes will be sent
to the senate by the state depart
ment dui ing the week. The inform
ulon was asked for by a resolution
In the early part of the last session,
and considerable surprise was ex
pressed that a reply was not receiv
ed before congress adjourned. The
object of the resolution was to make
the state department show cause
why the act passed In 1860, requir
ing notice to be given Great Brltian
of a desire of the United States to
abrogate the treaty regarding the
uumber of vessels to be kept on the
lakes had not been carried out.
The reply of the department will be
the basis for congressional legisla
tion looking to a modification of the
treaty, which will admit of the con
struction of war vessels by firms on
the lakes. The state department
ima Kpi.ii nnii9M nf Avnriincr tue
jolnt re30iutiou calling for the abro-
,,
on of tile treaty. Thoro aro
soma peoplo who think the treaty
aborgated. There is no doubt
that such a resolution was passed,
and It Is on record that notice was
given Great Brltian In accordance
therewith of the intention of this
government to abrogate the treaty.
What followed is a mystery outside
the diplomatic world. It Is under
stood tho statement will show the
notlco Issued uuder the act was
withdrawn within a few days after
Issued, and thai, for reasons then
existing, both countries agreed to
consider the treaty still In forca. It
will be further shuwn the treaty is
so regarded to tho present day by
both governments, notwithstanding
tho act of 1860.

Whitman is to understand a great

Prof. R. B. Anderson, late U. S.
minister to Denmark, hasgiven the
world a grand piece of literary work
In his recently published "Noree
Mythology" (S. C. Griggs & Co.,
Chicago; price, $2.50.) Himeelf a
deceudant of uoraelaud, he has tho
native genius for handling the sub
ject which could hardly be poss
essed by any writer of other birth.
His book gives a complete history of
the rich, robust literature of tho
north, besides copious extracts from
the Odlnlc poems. Longfellow, to
whom tho volume is dedicated, says
of the literature of that ceuntry:
"The myths are as wonderful, as
fantastic, as exciting as any of the
Greek fables, aud have the addit
ional elements of Ice and frost to
enchauce their wilduess aud mys
tery." The Eddas constitute one
of the great epics of the world and
are handled by Pof. Anderson
more comprehensively than any
one author has ever before consid
ered this ureat subject. Every
literary student should read it.
The name of Kate Douglas Wig
gin is a familiar one on the Pacific
coast. She is known and recog
nized as a leading spirit in child
literature and what pertains to
their advancement. A number of
her volumes for and pertaining to
children have been widely read,
but her latest and most useful vol
ume Is without doubt "Children's
Rights," recently from the press of
Houghton, Milllln & Co. It dwells
not only on the privileges to which
children are entitled, but gives
some excelleut advice to mothers
on children's plnya aud playthings,
as well on story telling. Tho latter
is undoubtedly tho greatest art,
science, accomplishment and nat
ural gift all combined with which a
parent can be endowed. The right
kind of a story properly told com
bines knowlege aud culture for the
child, and n book that intelligently
treats this one subject is a valuable
family acquisition. Every child in
the laud should have the benefits of
just such a book as this. On sale
