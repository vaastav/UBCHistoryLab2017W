U*r BATTLESHIP TO GO.
The Minnesota Sails To-morroxc and
the .Vary Yard Is Sprucing Up.
The Minnesota, flagship of Rear Admiral Thomas,
fa eooainand of the second division of the battleship
fleet that is to cruise to the Pacific. Coast, is the
last of the gi»at sea fighters left at the Brociiyn
navy yard She is scheduled to steam away at
•38 o'clock to-morrow morning and yesterday was

Haapton Roads, were r.c-iving the final touches
to their voyage through two oceans, the navy yard
vnt on as appearance not. unlike that of a flat that
is almost empty, with Ike last moving van at the
■net entrance. All aboat Ikere were gangs of
an Cleaning up th« debris. Laborers were Frrub

lickfi and Batcan stored, for the coming winter
aaj be a quiet one. and the forcr on duty at the
yard trill be the smallest in many y>ars. There will
be little n«*>d of most of the appliances with the
anywhere between Norfolk and Kan Francisco.
To the Panther's pier great trucks loaded with
heary ironwork brought their contribution. The

HARDSHIP TO NEW YORKER.—
Louis J. Van Echatck. 4th Infantry, or the well
known New York family, probably win be the ob
ject of special legislation curing the present ses
sion of Congress. He has been detailed as a cap
tain of Philippine, scouts, and at present is on de
tached service as governor of Cavite province, a
place requiring the. exercise of administrative
discretion. He is under expense while serving in
that capacity, and it has been decided that he
may not receive the pay of a captain, but must
revert to the pay of a first lieutenant of infantry.
This operates as a hardship to him. but there is
no way under the law of considering an officer
detailed as a captain of Philippine scouts as en
titled to that pay when ho is not actually purring
in the detailed position. Lieutenant Van Schalck
has been rendering an excellent account of himself
in Cavite. and th*> War Department Is disposed to
do everything possible In his behalf.
WILL BE EXAMINED FOR RETIREMENT
The following officer* have been directed to appear
before the Davis retiring board in Washington on
December 30 for examination: Lieutenant Colonel
John C. Muhlenberg. pay corps; Lieutenant Colonel
Daniel C. Kinsman, corps of engineers, and Majors
Francis J. Ives. surgeon; Patrick J. Hart, chap
lain, and Hiram 11. Chittenden, corps of engineers.
The Davis board has had under consideration the
cases of nearly twenty officers who failed to take
the horsemanship efficiency test ride ordered by
President Roosevelt. An amendment to existing
regulations for the Military Academy bearing- on
th« question of horsemanship, and believed to be
one result of the recent order of the President,
has be«n published by the War Department. Heie
atter the board of five officers appointed to ex
amine the graduates as to their fitness for mounted
service will take into consideration only the de
*.--.<- of efficiency shown by them in riding and
horsemanship and their Fize, wh«n bo great as to
indicate present or future unsultabllity for mounted
Ecrvic€.
FRESH BREAD IN THE FIELD.-Improve-
BMBtta in the Held oven are, under consideration by
the subsistence officers of the army. The field
oven has been long in use, and there have been
many complaints concerning it, one, of th#» objec
tions being that a large door, covering several of
th« ovens, when opened, permits the egress of a
blast of hot air, whiihje trying to the bakers. It
is now proposed to have a. door for each oven
and to rearranc*i the internal Ptructure so as to
improve the circulation of air. The new oven will
ba of the sheet-iron type, and of a size which may
b« easily handled and packed for transportation In
army wagons.
NAVAL. GUNNERY NEXT YEAR—Arrange
ments have been made for holding the target prac
tice of the ships of the Atlantic fleet in ila^d*
lena Bay in April, when the vessels arrive on the
Pacific Coast. Before that time the ships of the
Pacific fl<-.-t will have held their target practice,
which is really the gun pointers' test. Later th©
battle practice will be held at whatever place, the
ships may be. If they are on the Pacific Coast
the exercises will be conducted there, either in Mag
dalcna Bay or further north. If the chips are to
return to the United States by way of Suez, the
battle practice is likely to be held in Manila Bay.
The fact that the ships will be on the move for
the ri'-xt year at least will not be allowed to in
terfere to any extent with naval gunnery, either
with the heavy batteries or the email arms.
WIRELESS TELEPHONE SUCCESSFUL.— The
torpedo boat destroyers which have sailed for the
Pacific Coast have, had ample opportunity to use
their wireless telephones, and such success has
attended the operations of the instruments that
there is no question of their practical value. It la
considered that if the wireless telephone can be
relied on to operate for a distance of five or six
mil's it is more than meeting naval necessities. In
the departure of the torpedo boat destroyers ; it
was found that they were able to maintain com
munication with the shore for a distance of thir
teen miles. These messages and the distance have
been verified.

been issued:
