Menace to Peace.
Washington, Dec. 7. President Wil
son today delivered the following mes
sage to congress:
Gentlemen of the Congress: Since I
last had the privilege of addressing
you on the state of the Union the war
of nations on the other side of the sea,
which had then only begun to disclose
, Its portentous proportions, has extend
ed Its threatening and sinister scope
until it has swept within its flame
some portion of every quarter of the
flobe, not excepting our own hemi
sphere, has altered the whole face of
International affairs, and now presents
prospect of reorganization and re
construction such as statesmen and
peoples have never boon called upon
to attempt before.
We have stood apart, studiously neu
tral It was our manifest duty to do
so. Not only did we have no part or
Interest in the policies which seem to
have brought the conflict on; It was
necessary, if a universal catastrophe
was to be avoided, that a limit should
be est to the sweep of destructive war
sad that some part of the great family
of nations should keep the processes
of peace alive, If only to prevent col
lective economic ruin end the break
down throughout the world of the in
dustries by which Its populations are
fed and sustained. It was manifestly
the duty of the self-governed nations
of this hemisphere to redress, if pos
sible, the balance of economic loss
and confusion In the other, If they
could do nothing more. In the day of
readjustment and recuperation we
earnestly hope and believe that they
can be of Infinite service.
American Nations Partner.
In this neutrality, to which they
were bidden not only by their separate
life and their habitual detachment
from the politics of Europe but also by
clear perception of International
duty, the states of America have be
come conscious of a new and moro
vital community interest and moral
artnership in affairs, more clearly
conscious of the many common sym
pathies and Interests and duties which
bid them stand together.
There was a time In the early days
of our own great nation and of the re
publics fighting their way to Inde
pendence In Central and South Amer
ica when the government of the Unit
ed States looked upon itself as In some
sort the guardian of the republics to
the south of her as against any en
croachments or efforts at political con
trol from the other sidi of the water;
felt It its duty to play the part even
without Invitation from them; and I
think that we can claim that the task
was undertaken with a true and dis
interested enthusiasm for the freedom
' of the Americas and the unmolested
self-government of her independent
peoples. But It was always difficult to
maintain such a role without offense
to the pride of the peoples whose free
dom of action we sought to protect,
and without provoking serious miscon
ceptions of our motives, and every
thoughtful man of affairs must wel
come the altered circumstances of the
new day In whose light we now stand,
when there is no claim of guardian
ship or thought of wards but Instead.
full and honorable association as of
partners between ourselves and our
neighbors. In the interest of all Amer
ica, north and south. Our concern for
the Independence and prosperity of the
states of Central and South America
is not altered. We retain unabated
the spirit that has inspired us through
out the whole life of our government
and which was so frankly put Into
words by President Monroe. W still
mean always to make a common cause
of national Independence and of po
litical liberty In America.
Attitude Toward Mexico.
W have been put to the test In
the case of Mexico, and we have stood
the test Whether we have benefited
Mexico by the course we have pursued
remains to be seen. Her fortunes are
In her own hands. But we have at
least proved that we will not take ad
vantage of her In her distress and un
dertake to Impose upon her an order
and government of our own choosing.
Ws will aid and befriend Mexico, but
we will not coerce her; and our course
with regard to her ought to be suffi
cient proof to all America that w
seek no political suzerainty or selfish
control.
The moral is, that the states of
America are not hostile rivals but co-
operating friends, and that their grow
ing sense of community of Interest,
alike in matters political and In mat?
ters economic. Is likely to give them
a new significance as factors in Inter
- national affairs and in the political
, history of the world.
Drawing the Americas Together.
There Is, I venture to point out. an
especial significance Just now attach
ing to this whole matter of drawing
the Americas together in bonds of hon
- prahle partnership and mutual advan-
tage because of the economic readjust
ments which the world must inevi
tably witness within the next genera
tion, when peace shall have at last re
sumed its healthful tasks. In the per
formance of these tasks I believe the
Americas to be destined to play their
parts together. I am Interested to fix
your attention on this prospect now
because unless you take it within your
view and permit the full significance
of it to command your thought I can
not find the right light in which to set
forth the particular matter that lies
at the very front of my whole thought
as I address you today. I mean na
tional defense.
"No one who really comprehends the
spirit of the great people for whom
we are appointed to speak can fall to
perceive that their passion is for
peace, their genius best displayed in
the practice of the arts of peace. Great
democracies are not belligerent. They
do not seek or desire war. Their
thought is of Individual liberty and of
the free labor that supports life and
the uncensored thought that quickens
it. Conquest and dominion are not in
our reckoning, or agreeable to our
principles. Dut Just because we de
mand unmolested development and
the undisturbed government of our
own lives upon our own principles of
right and liberty, we resent, from
whatever quarter it may come, the ag
gression we ourselves will not prac
tice. We Insist upon security in prose
cuting bur self-chosen lines of nation
al development. We do more thpn that.
We demand it also for others.
Question of Preparedness.
Out of such thoughts grow all our
policies. We regard war merely as a
means of asserting the rights of a peo
ple against aggression. And ws are
as fiercely Jealous of coercive or dic
tatorial power withm our own nation
as of aggression from without. Wo
will not maintain a standing army ex
cept for uses which are as necessary
In times of peace as in times of war;
and we Bhall always see to It that our
military peace establishment Is no
larger than Is actually and continu
ously needed for the uses of days In
which no enemies, move against us.
But we do believe In a body of free
citizens ready and sufficient to take
care of themselves and of the govern
ments which they have set up to serve
them.
But war has never been a mere mat
ter of men and guns. It Is a thing of
disciplined might If our citizens are
ever, to fight effectively upon a sudden
summons, they must know how mod
ern fighting Is done, and what to do
when the summons comes to render
themselves immediately available and
immediately effective. And the gov
ernment must be their servant In this
matter, must supply them with the
training they need to take care of
themselves and of It.
It Is with these Ideals In mind that
the plans of the department of war
for more adequate national defense
were conceived which will be laid be
fore you, and which I urge you to
sanction and put into effect as soon
as they can be properly scrutinized
and discussed. They seem to me the
essential first steps, and they seem
to me for the present sufficient
Larger Army Plan,
They contemplate an Increase of the
standing force of the regular army
from Its present strength of 5,023
officers and 102,985 enlisted men of
all services to a strength of 7,138
officers and 134,707 enlisted men,
or 141,843, all told, all services,
rank and file, by the addition
of fifty-two companies of coast
artillery, fifteen companies of engi
neers, ten regiments of Infantry, four
regiments of field artillery, and four
aero squadrons, besides 750 officers
required tor a great variety of extra
service, especially the all Important
duty of training the citizen force of
which I shall presently speak, 792
noncommissioned officers ' for serv
ice in drill, recruiting and the
like, and the necessary quota of en
listed men for the quartermaster
corps, the hospital corps, the ord
nance department, and other similar
auxiliary services. These are the ad
ditions necessary to render the crmy
adequate for Its present duties, duties
which it has to perform not only upon
our own continental coasts and bor
ders and at our interior army posts,
but also In the Philippines, in the
Hawaiian Islands, at the Isthmus, and
In Porto Rico.
By way of making the country ready
to assert some part of Its real power
promptly and upon a larger scale,
should occasion arise, the plan also
contemplates supplementing the army
by a force of 400,000 disciplined clti
sens, raised In Increments of 133.
000 a year throughout a period
of three years. This It Is proposed
to do by a process of enlistment un
der which the serviceable men of the
country would be asked to bind them
selves to serve with the colors for pur
pose of training for short periods
throughout three years, and to come
to the colors at call at any time
throughout an additional "furlough"
period of three years. This force of
400,000 men would be provided with
personal accoutrements as fast as
enlisted and their equipment for
the field made ready to be sup
plied at any time. They would be
assembled for training at stated in
tervals at convenient places in asso
ciation with suitable units of the
regular army. ' Their period of annual
training would not necessarily exceed
two months In the year.
At least so much by. the way of
preparation for defense seems to me
to be absolutely Imperative now. "We
cannot do less.
The Neva! Program.
The program which will be laid be
fore yon by the secretary of the navy
Is similarly conceived. It Involves
only a shortening of the time within,
STRIKING POINTS IN PRESIDENT WILSONS MESSAGE
The department of war contemplates an Increase of the standing
force of the regular army from Its present strength of 5.C23 officers
and 102,985 enlisted men to 7,136 officers and 134,707 enlisted men, and
supplementing the army by a force of 400,000 disciplined citizens.
It will be to the advantage of the country for the congress to adopt
a comprehensive plan for putting the navy upon a final footing of
strength and efficiency.
The gravest threats against our national peace and safety have
been uttered within our own borders.
It Is necessary for many weighty reasons of national efficiency and
development that we should hrve a great merchant marine.
It seems to me a clear dictate of prudent statesmanship and frank
finance that Irt what we are now to undertake we should pay as w go.
We should be following an almost universal example of modern gov
ernment If we we re, to draw the greater part or even the whole of the
revenues we need from the Income taxes.
We have been put to the test In the ease of Mexico and we have
stood the test Whether we have benefited Mexico by the course we
have pursued remains to be seen. Our concern for the independence
and prosperity of the states of Central and South America is not
altered.'
which plans long matured shall be
carried out; but it does make definite
and explicit a program which has
heretofore been only implicit, held in
the minds of the two committees on
naval affairs and disclosed in the de
bates of the two houses but nowhere
formulated or formally adopted. It
seems to me very clear that it will be
to the advantage of the country for
tho congress to adopt a comprehen
sive plan for putting the navy upon
a final footing of strength and effi
ciency and to press that plan to com
pletion within the next five years.
We have always looked to the navy of
the country as our first and chief
line of defense; we have always seen
It to be our manifest course of pru
dence to be strong on the seas. Year
by year we have been creating a navy
which now ranks very high Indeed
among the navies of the maritime na
tions. We should now definitely de
termine how we shall complete what
we have begun, and how soon.
The program to be laid before you
contemplates the construction within
five years of ten battleships, six bat
tle cruisers, ten scout cruisers, fifty
destroyers, fifteen fleet submarines,
eighty-five coast submarines, foor gun
boats, one hospital ship, two ammuni
tion ships, two fuel oil ships, and one
regular repair ship. It is proposed
that of this number we shall the first
year provide for the construction of
two battleships, two battle cruisers,
three scout cruisers, Often destroyers,
five fleet submarines, twenty-five coast
submarines, two gunboats, and one
hospital ship; the second year, two
battleships, one scout cruiser, ten de
stroyers, four fleet submarines, fifteen
coast submarines, one gunboat, and
one fuel oil ship; the third year, two
battleships, one battle cruiser, two
scout cruisers, five destroyers, two
fleet submarines, and fifteen coast
submarines; the fourth year, two bat
tleships, two battle cruisers, two scout
cruisers, ten destroyers, two fleet sub
marines, fifteen coast submarines, one
ammunition ship, and one fuel oil
ship; and the fifth year, two battle
ships, one battle cruiser, two scout
cruisers, ten destroyers, two fleet sub
marines, fifteen coast submarines, one
gunboat, one ammunition ship, and
one repair ship.
More Men for the Navy.
The secretary of the navy Is asking
also for the Immediate addition to the
personnel of the navy of 7,600 sail
ors. 1,200 apprentice seamen, and
1,500 marines. This increase would
be sufficient to care for the ships
which are to be completed with
in the fiscal year 1917 and also for the
number of men which must be put In
training to man the ships which will
be completed early In 1918. It Is also
necessary that the number of midship
men at the Naval academy at Annap
olis should be Increased by at least
three hundred
If this full program should be car
ried out we should have built or build
ing In 1921, according to the estimates
of survival and standards of classifi
cation followed by the general board
of the department an effective navy
consisting of 27 battleships, of the first
line. 6 battle cruisers, 25 battleships
of the second line. 10 armored cruis
ers, 13 scout cruisers, 6 first-class
cruisers. S second-class cruisers. 10
third-class cruisers. 108 destroyers, 18
fleet submarines, 157 coast submarines,
6 monitors , 20 gunboats, 4 supply
ships, 15 fuel ships. 4 transports,
2 tenders to torpedo Teste's- 8 ves
sels of special types, and 1 ammuni
tion ships. This would be a navy fit
ted to our needs and worthy of our
traditions. .
But armies and Instruments of war
are only part of what has to be con
sidered if we are to consider the su
preme matter of national self-sufficien
cy and security In all Its aspects.
There are other great matters which
will be thrust upon our attention
whether we will or not There Is, for
example, a very pressing question of
trade and shipping Involved In this
great problem, of national adequacy.
It Is necessary for many weighty rea
sons of national efficiency and devel
opment that we should have a great
merchant marine.
It is high time we repaired our mis
take and resumed our commercial Inde
pendence on the seas. .
Need ef Merchant Marine.
For it Is a question of Independ
ence. If other nations go to war or
seek to hamper each other's com
merce, our merchants, it seems, are
at their mercy, to do with as they
please. We must use tfcefr ship, and
use them as they determine. We have
not ships enough ef our otto. We
cannot handle our own commerce on
the seas. Our Independence is provin
cial, and is only on land and within
oar own borders. We are not likely
to be permuted to use even the ships
of other nations In rivalry of their
own trade, and are without means to
extend our commerce even where the
doors are wide open and our goods
desired. Such a situation is not to
be endured. It is of capital import
ance not only that the United States
should be its own carrier on the seas
and enjoy the economic independence
which only an adequate merchant ma
rlne would give it. but also that the
American hemisphere as a whole
should enjoy a like independence and
self-sufficiency, If it is not to be drawn
into the tangle of European affairs.
Without such independence the whole
question of our political unity and
self-determination is very seriously
clouded and complicated Indeed.
Moreover, we can develop no true
or effective American policy without
ships of our own not ships of war,
but ships of peace, carrying goods and
carrying much more; creating friend
ships and rendering Indispensable
services to all Interests on this side
the water.
Must Provide Ships.
With a view to meeting these
pressing necessities of our commerce
and availing ourselves at the earliest
possible moment of the present un
paralleled opportunity of Unking the
two Americas together In bonds of mu
tual Interest and service, an oppor
tunity which may never return again
if we miss it now, proposals will bo
made to the present congress for the
purchase or construction of ships to
be owned and directed by the govern
ment similar to those made to the last
congress, but modified in some essen
tial particulars. I recommend these
proposals to you for your prompt ac
ceptance with the more confidence
because every month that has elapsed
since the former proposals were made
has made the necessity for such action
more and more manifestly imperative.
That need was. then foreseen; it is
now acutely felt and everywhere real
ized by those for whom trade is wait
ing but who can find no conveyance
for their goods. I am not so much In
terested In the particulars of the pro
gram as I am in taking immediate ad
vantage of the great opportunity which
awaits us if we will but act In this
emergency.
'The plans for the armed forces of
the nation which I have outlined, and
for the general policy of adequate
preparation for mobilization and de
fense, involve of course very large ad
ditional expenditures of moneyex
penditures which will considerably ex
ceed the estimated revenues of the
government It is made my duty by
law, whenever the estimates of ex
penditure exceed the estimates of
revenue, to call the attention of the
congress to the fact and suggest any
means of meeting the deficiency that
It may be wise or possible for me to
suggest I am ready to believe that It
would be my duty to do so In any case;
and I feel particularly bound to tpeak;
of the matter when It appears that the
deficiency will arise directly out of
the adoption by the congress of meas
ures which I myself urge it to adopt
Allow me, therefore, to speak briefly
of the present state of the treasury
and of the fiscal problems which the
next year will probably disclose.
State of the Finances.
, On the thirtieth of June last there
was an available balance In the gen
eral fund of the treasury of $104,170.
105.78. The total estimated receipts
for the year 1916, on the assumption
that the emergency revenue measure
passed by the last congress will not be
extended beyond its present limit the
thirty-first of December, 1915, and
that the present duty of one cent per
pound on sugar will be discontinued
after the first of May, 1916, will be
$67065,500. The balance of June last
and these estimated revenues come,
therefore, to a grand total of $774,
435.605.78. The total estimated dis
bursements for the present fiscal year,
including $25,000,000 for the Panama
canal, $12,000,000 for probable de
ficiency appropriations, and $50,
000 tor. miscellaneous debt redemp
tions, will be $753,891,000; and
the balance in the general fund of the
treasury will be reduced to $20,644,
605.78. The emergency revenue act If
continued beyond Its present time lim
itation, would produce, during the half
year then remaining, about $41,000.
000. The duty of one cent per pound
on sugar, if continued, would produce
during the two months of the fiscal
year remaining after the first of May,
about $15,000 000. These two sums,
amounting together to $56,000,000. if
added to the revenues of the second
half of the fiscal year, would yield the
treasury at the end of the year an
available balance of $76,644,605.78.
The addition! revenues required
to carry out the program of military
and na-al preparation of which I have
spoken, -fould. as at present estimated.
be for the fiscal year 1917, $93,800,000.
Those figures, taken with the figures
for the present fiscal year which 1
have already given, disclose our finan
cial problem for the year 1917. As
suming that the taxes Imposed by the
emergency revenue act and the pres
ent duty on sugar are to be discontln
ued, and that the balance at the close
of the present fiscal year will be only
$20,644,605.78, that the disbursements
for the Panama canal will again be
about twenty-five millions, and that
the additional expenditures for the
army and navy are authorized by the
congress, the deficit in the general
fund of the treasury on the thirtieth
of June, 1917, will be nearly two hun
dred and thirty-five millions. To this
sum at least fifty millions should be
added to represent a safe working bal
ance for the treasury, and twelve mil
lions to include the usual deficiency
estimates In 1917; and these additions
would make a total deficit of some two
hundred and ninety-seven millions. If
the present taxes should be continued
throughout this year and the next,
however, there would bo a balance in
the -treasury of some seventy-nix and
a half millions at the end of the pres
ent fiscal year, and a deficit at the
end of the next year of only some fifty
millions, or, reckoning in sixty-two
millions for deficiency appropriations
and a safe treasury belance at the end
of the year, a total deficit of some
one hundred and twelve millions. The
obvious moral of the figures is that it
is a plain counsel of prudence to con
tlnue all of the preesnt taxes or their
equivalents, and confine ourselves to
the problem of providing $112,000,000
of new revenue rather than $297,000,
000. "
Nw Sources of Revenue.
How shall we obtain the new reve
nue? It seems to me a clear dictate of
prudent statesmanship and frank
finance that In what we are now, I
hope, to undertake, we should pay as
we go. The people of the country are
entitled to know Just what burdens of
taxation they are to carry, and to know
from the outset, now. The new bills
should be paid by Internal taxation.
To what sources, then, shall we
turn 7 This la so peculiarly a question
which the gentlemen of the house of
representatives are expected under
the Constitution to propose an answer
to that you will hardly expect me to
do more than discuss it in very gen
eral terms. We should be following
an almost universal example of mod
em government If we were to draw
the greater part or even the whole of
the revenues we need from the In
come taxes. By somewhat lowering the
present limits of exemption and the
figure at which the surtax shall begin
to be imposed, and by Increasing, step
by step throughout the present gradu
ation, the surtax itself, the income
taxes as at present apportioned
would yield sums sufficient to balance
the books of the treasury at the end
of the fiscal year 1917 without any
where making the burden unreason
ably or oppressively heavy. The pre
cise reckonings are fully and accurate
ly set out in the report of the secre
tary of the treasury which will be im
mediately laid before you.
And there are many additional
sources of revenue which can Justly be
resorted to without hampering the In
dustries of the country or putting any
too great charge upon Individual ex
penditure. A one per cent tax per
gallon on gasoline and naptha would
yield, at the present estimated pro
duction, $10,000,000; a tax of 50 cents
per horse power on automobiles and
internal explosion engines, $15,000.
000; a stamp tax on bank checks,
probably $18,000,000; a tax of 25 cents
per ton on pig iron, $10,000,000; a tax
of 50 cents per ton on fabricated iron
and steel, probably $10,000,000. In a
country of great industries like this It
ought to be easy to distribute the bur
dens of taxation without making them
anywhere bear '.oo heavily or too ex
clusively upon uny one set of persons
or undertakings. What Is clear Is,
that the industry of this generation
should pay the bills of this generation.
I have spoken to you today, gentle
men, upon a single theme, the thor
ough preparation of the nation to cars
for Its own security and to make sure
of entire freedom to play the Impartial
role In this hemisphere and In the
world which we all believe to have
been providentially assigned to It I
have had In my mind no thought of
any Immediate or particular danger
arising out of our relations with other
nations. We are at peace with all
the nations of the world, and there Is
reason to hope that no question In
controversy between this and other
governments will lead to any serious
breach of amicable relations, grave as
some differences of attitude and policy
have been and may yet turn out to be.
I am sorry to say that the graveet
threats against our national peace and
safety have been uttered within our
own borders. There are citizens of
the United Statos, I blush to admit
born under other flags bat welcomed
under our generous naturalization
laws to the .full freedom and oppor
tunity of America, who have poured
the poison of disloyalty Into the very
arteries of our national Ife; who have
sought to bring the authority and
good name of our government into
contempt to destroy our industries
wherever they thought it effective for
their vindictive purposes to strike at
them, and to debase our politics to
the uses of foreign Uitrigue. Their
number is not great as compared with
the whole number of those sturdy
hosts by which our nation has been
enriched In recent generations out '
of YfrirB'forelgn stocks;- but It la great j

while ago such a thing would have
seemed incredible. Because It was
incredible we made no preparation
for it. We would have been,' almost
ashamed to prepare for it, as if we
were suspicious of ourselves, our own
comrades and neighbors! But the
ugly and incredible thing has actual
ly come about and we are without
adequate federal laws to deal with it
I urge you to enact such laws at the
earliest posslhje moment and feel that
in doing so I am urging you to do
nothing leBs than save the honor and
self-respect of the nation. Such crea
tures of passion, disloyalty, and an
archy must be crushed out They are
not many, but they are infinitely
malignant, and the hand of our power
should close over them at once. VThey
have formed plots to destroy property,
they have entered Into conspiracies
against the neutrality of the govern
ment, they have sought to pry into
every confidential transaction of the

alien to our own. It is possible to

Are Disgrace to the Nation.
I wish that it could be said that
only a few men, misled by mistaken
sentiments of allegiance to the govern
ments under which they were born,
had been guilty of disturbing the self
possession and misrepresenting the
temper and principles of the country
during these days of terrible war,
when it would seem that every man
who was truly an American would
Instinctively make it his duty and his
pride to keep the scales of Judgment
even and prove himself a partisan of
no nation but his own. But It cannot
There are some men among us, and
many resident abroad who, though
born and bred In the United States
and calling themselves Americana,
have so forgotten themselves and
their honor as citizens as to put their
passionate sympathy with one or the
other side In the great European con
flict above their regard for the peace ,
and dignity of the United States. They
also preach and practice disloyalty.
No laws, I suppose, can reach cor
ruptions of the mind and heart; but I
should not speak of others without
also speaking of these and expressing
the even deeper humiliation and scorn
which every self-possessed and
thoughtfully patriotic American must
feel when he thinks of them and of
the discredit they are daily bringing
upon us. '
While we speak of the preparation
of the nation to make sure of her
security and her effective power we
must not fall into the patent error of
supposing that her real strength
comes from armaments and mere safe
guards of written law.
What Is more Important Is, that the
industries and resources of the coun
try should be available and ready for
mobilization.
The transportation problem Is an
exceedingly serious and pressing one
In this country. There has from
time to time of late been reason
to fear that our railroads would
not much longer be able to cope with
It successfully, as at present equipped
and co-ordained. I suggest that It
would be wise to f .ovlde for a com
mission of inquiry to ascertain by a
thorough canvass of the whole ques
tion whether our laws as at present
framed and administered are as serv
iceable as they might be In the solu
tion of the problem. It is otriously a
problem that lies at the very founda
tion of our efficiency as a people. Such
an inquiry ought to draw Out every
circumstance and opinion worth con
sidering and we need to know all sides
of the matter If we mean to do any
thing In the field of federal legislation.
Regulation of Railroad.
No one, I am sure, would wish to
take any backward step. The regula
tion of the railways of the country by
federal commission has had admirable
results and has fully Justified the
hopes and expectations of those by
whom the policy of regulation was
originally proposed. The question Is
not what should we nndoT It Is,
whether there Is anything else we can
do that would supply us with effective
means. In the very process of regula
tion, for bettering the conditions un
der which the railroads are operated ,
and for making them more useful serv
ants of the country as a whole. It
seems to me that It might be the part
of wisdom, therefore, beAre further
legislation in this field is attempted, to
look at the whole problem of co-ordination
and efficiency In the full light of a
fresh assessment of circumstance and
opinion, as a guide to dealing with the
several parts of it
For what we are seeking now, what
In my mind Is the single thought of
this message, is national efficiency and
security. We serve a great nation.
We should serve it In the spirit of Its
peculiar genius. It Is the genius of
common men for self-government in
dustry. Justice, liberty and peace. We
should see to it that it lacks no lustra
ment no facility or vigor of law, to
make it sufficient to play its part with
energy, safety and aseured succs, la
this we are no partisans bat hertJda
and prophets of a new age.
