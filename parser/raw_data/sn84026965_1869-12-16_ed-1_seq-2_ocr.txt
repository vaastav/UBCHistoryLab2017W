AGBICTJLTUBAL EXCHANGES.
The December number of the Rural Carolinian
aas been recei ved. In our judgment, there is an
improvement upon the previous issues, by the
presentation of more articles of a practical nature.
The publishers are succeeding admirably, aud
their monthly is destined to become the favorite of
the farming community. Subscriptions received
at this ofiice. Terms $2 per year.
The December number of the Southern Cultiva?
tor is likewise upon our table. We have so often
commended this journal that it is only necessary
to say there is no diminution of interest or value
in its pages. Persona whose subscriptions are
about to expire, should renew at once.
Every : armer in South Carolina ought to sub?
scribe for both of the above named periodicals,
and. thus obtain a variety of opinion upon agricul?
tural subjects.
The Carolina Farmer, an eight-page weekly, is
one of the cheapest family aewspapets in the
country. It devotes about e^aal spice for the
farm and fireside, and will compare favorably in
appearance with any of the Northern weeklies,
and is far superior in. its adaptedness to the wants
of" Soavhern- readers. The proprietor announces a
prize of $25 in gold for the largest, $15 in gold
for the second largest, and. $10 in gold for the
third largest club of subscribers sent by any one
person between Dec. 15, 18C9, and March 15,
1870. Parties wishing to compete for these gold
prizes can obtain specimen copies of the paper
and blank subscription lists by addressing Wm. H.
Bee.vard, editor and proprietor,.Wilmington, N: C.
THE PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE.
We give the principal portions of the Presi?
dent's M?*sage to Congress, and have oaly omitted
?? such paragraphs as relate to matters in which our
? . people are not directly interested. The criticisms
of the press upon the first effort of Gen. Gr.ant
in this sphere of duty are not generally of a com?
plimentary nature, even within the limits of his
own party, and in many instauces the comments
are exceedingly brief. We do not propose to
make an exception to ike rule, so far as brevity is
concerned. We confess to disappointment, how?
ever, after a perusal of this document. As a
State paper, there is nothing of material conse?
quence iu its pages, and there is barely one sug?
gestion in which its author has dared to disagree
with Congress. Undoubtedly, in our humble
judgment, the President had no assistance in the
preparation of his Message, and we had expected
. that be would foreshadow a policy looking to the
future greatness and prosperity of this country,
and in this respect evince a marked contrast to the
narrow spirit and partisan character of the legis.
lation nott controlling the country. He has failed
to reach the height of independence, and merely
illustrates the subserviency of the hour in acqui?
escing wich the measures adopted by Congress on
the various qu estions of public moment. He goes
a step further, and plainly insinuates that he will
hereafter refrain from interposing the prerogatives
of his ofiice against the will of the legislative ma?
jority. He is ready to execute their laws, and
pledges himself to a strict enforcement of them.
It is evident that he regards the Presidential office
as only to be used in executing the will of the
Republican, party, and as entirely free from any
imoh power as tc operate in the light of a check
against unbridled legislation. He wants things
i;o go smoothly with big administration, and cer?
tainly has no desire for the stormy experience of
Uis immediate predecessor. ''Let us hare peace I"

SOUTH C ABO UNA BSfUKEI SPECIE PAY?
MENT.
The most interesting debate that bit* yet oc?
curred during the present session of the Legisla?
ture of thip State took place on Friday last, upon
the bill providing for the ''payment of principal
and interest of the public debt in gold md silver
coin." This measure was introduced in the House
some days before, and was promptly voted down.
In the meantime, however, dusky legislators were
industriously and effectually persuaded to recant
their previous action, and it was openly charged
in the ensuing debate that bribery and corruption
caused a "change to come over the spirit of their
dreams." In any event, when the bill was called
up on Friday last, it was apparent that friends
were flocking to the standard of the bondholders
in such goodly numbers as to insure its passage.
An amendment was offeaed by the custodian of j
the bill, Mr. Tomuxsox, striking out the words
??principal and," thus leaving only the interest on
the publio debt to be paid in coiu. With this
modification, the bill was passed by a vote of GG
(0 26. Our Representative, Mnj. John B. Moore,
participated in the discussion, and dealt some
heavy blows against the prime movers of this
"infamous measure," as be aptly characterized it.
It is well known, that the bonds of the State have
been purchased to a great extent by persons out.
tide of the State, who are iu the "ring" of the
pyeaent administration, and for whose benefit this
bill was introduced. It is said that some of these
interested parties were present during the debate
in the House, und that tbeir countenances were
considerably briglueued by the successful man*
aeuve'ring of its friends on the floor. The bill
will go through the Senate without any trouble,
aud of course the Governor will readily sign it.
The debate in the House will be published in our
columns next week.

SOTtMARY OF LEGISLATIVE PROCEEDINGS.
The Legislatur? has been in'session for "nearly
four weeks, and the work is just fairly begun. It
was givon out, in' the beginning of"-the session,
1 that six weeks would suffice, to coniplete the neces?
sary legislation. Now the'time is extended in?
definitely, and many think that the 1st of March
JtiW find the. members drawing their six'dollars'
per day. It is proposed to take a recess of two
weelcs, from the 22nd December until the 5th of
January, and we think it probable whea the mem?
bers set in with the New Year, that they .will be
disposed to contract with the State fora conside?
rable term of service. As the proceedings have
been almost devoid of interest, we have not given
them much 6pace heretofore, and it is only neces?
sary at this time to briefly outline some of the
most important measures introduced within the
past week, in order (bat our readers may know
what has been so fur proposed.
A bill to increase the salaries of the Justices of
the Supremo Court and the Circuit Judges has
passed the Senate. It provides that the Justices
shall receive $4,500 per annum and the Judges
$4,000.
? Notice has been given of a bill to amend "an
act to organize townships, and to define their
powers and privileges." This bill provides for a
thorough overhauling of the township system, and
a reduction of the expenses by making the officers
perform the duties for lesa pay.
Notices have been given in both Houses that bills
will be introduced to repeal "an act to incorporate
the Air Lice Railroad." This action is probably
contemplated in consequence of the fact that re?
cently certain colored Senators from this State
were ejected from the first-class passenger cars of
the Richmond and Danville Railroad, of which
: Col. A. S. Bufobu is the President? and that this
gentleman holds the same relation to the Air Line
Road. Indeed, it hi charged by the Senators since
I th*t* return that Col. Bcfobu ordered their eject
! ment, and assisted in executing the order. To re?
peal the charter of an important railway from such
motives is an exhibition of petty spite worthy of
the narrow-minded views of these Republican
legislators, whose motto appears to be "that Caesar
can do no wrong."
In the Senate, the "bill to establish and main?
tain a system of free common schools" has been
under discussion.
A bill has been introduced which authorizes the
Governor to appoint three persons, who shall be
styled the jury commissioners of the State, and to
hold office for four years; these commissioners to
appoint a deputy for each county, whose duty it
shall be, duriug his four years' term of office, to
prepare a list every year of such inhabitants as
are not exempted from jury duty by law, provided
that the list dees not include less than one in
twenty, nor more than one in ten, of the voters of
said county; for which the deputy is to receive
three dollars per day and five cents mileage in the
discharge of his duties.
A report from the county commissioners of An?
derson has been submitted to the Senate and ap?
propriately referred. It states that they have
marked off the township boundaries according to
law, but had not placed the posts at the bounda?
ries, and recommended that they be allowed to
put up oak posts instead of iron or stone, as re?
quired by law, stating that the oak would be much
less expensive and would answer the purpose
equally as well. t
A bill has been introduced to authorize admin?
istrators, executors, and other fiduciaries, to sell
certain evidences of indebtedness at public sale,
and to compromise in'certain cases. This is prob?
ably intended to give relief in such cases as are
now pending, where administrators and others
cannot be discharged, in consequence of the diffi?
culties in the way of settling or compromising old
debts.
-?.
RIVER FISHERIES.
The recommendations of Got. Scott in regard
to this important subject received the early atten?
tion of the Legislature, and a Special Comnvttee
was appointed, to whom was referred so' much of
the Message as related to River Fisheries. Mr. 13.
Frank Sloan, Representative from Anderson
county, was made the chairman of this committee,
and has submitted his report to the Legislature.
This report was ordered to lie over for future con
consideration, nod a joint resolution authorizing
the appointment of Fish Commisioners, and de?
fining the duties thereof, together with a bill for
the better protection of migratory fish, were in?
troduced. The report is ?9 follows :
Mr. Sloan, from the Special Committee onRiTer
Fisheries, submitted a report ?iatiug that for want
of time they have been unable to give the subject
that care and attention which its importance de?
mands. The art of pisciculture is attracting a
great deal of attention, both in Europe and in the
Northern States, and enough has been ascertained
by actual experiments to prove that the restora?
tion of migratory fish to our inland streams und
the propagation and culture of the finer varieties
of fresh water fish is only a question of time,
proper legislation and a sinnll outlay of money,
in our mountain streams mny be found thousands
of salmon trout, where only a few years since
they were unknown. This?one of, if not the
fioeat of, varieties of fresh water fish?was intro?
duced into one of the branches of Toxaway River,
by one of our public spirited Citizen?, by being
transported in an ordinary tin bucket and turned
loose, and they have now increased to such an ex?
tent that a single person, with a hook and line,,
can take from 200 to 300 in an afternoon. They
have been more recently introduced into a small
stream near Walhalla, in.Oconee county, where
tbey are rapidly increasing in numbers. The ar?
tificial batching of fish, spawn in almost countless
numbers, has proven to be a task so simple and
and cheap that it would appear almost criminal in
our Legislature not to adopt Home measure where?
by our rivers, onoe filled with migratory fish, shall
be replenished.
In our own State, where every person so dispo?
sed has been allowed, either from want of a Uw
or the proper carrying out of existing laws on the
subject, to fish indiscriminately at all seasons, and
in any manner, there is ho encouragement to pri?
vate parties to give it that attention they would
wish; aud as the spirit of the age requires that
Our streams should be public highways, and fish
should be public property, (where not in private
fish ponds,) it is necessary that some legislation
should be had to prevent excessive fishing.
A nation to be happy should have some inex?
pensive means of recreation; thcro is none so
cheap and inofi"ennive as the sport of fishing,
which combines recreation with profit, and in the
judgment of your committee any legislation that
will tend to increase the quantity of fish in our
streams will add both to the prosperity and hap?
piness of our people. '
Masonic?The following brothreu have been
elected and installed as officers of Hiram Lodge,
No. 68, A. F. M., for the ensuing Masonioycar:

SEHOVAL OF POLITICAL DISABILITIES.
In addition to the bill which passed Congress
the other day, relieving (he political disabilities of
over five- hundred citizens of the South, Mr.
Stephbkson, a Radical member of Congress from
Ohio, has introduced a bill proposing to remove
entirely the* political disabilities imposed by the
third section of th^ Fourteenth Amendment. We
give the full"text of the bill introduced. It will
be observed, that there is still a condition prece?
dent annexed to- the proposed general' amnesty.
It will be further observed, that ;this condition is,
one which the people of a State may comply with,
in good faith, and yet be deprived of the benefits
suggested by the bill itself. This condition is the
ratification of the Fifteenth/Amendment..(guaran?
teeing universal suffrage, by'tt sTlfficlent number of
States to secure its adoption ; and until this ratifi?
cation takes place, the amnesty would not follow,
even if Congress passes the present bill. For in?
stance, the Legislature of this State has already
ratified the Fifteenth Amendment, and there is
not the ghost of a chance that such ratification
will be withdrawn ; and yet, under the provisions
of this bill, such action secures no relief to dis?
qualified persons in South Carolina until the peo?
ple of other States, over whom they have no con?
trol, taie the same action, through their Legisla?
tures. It would be far better, as a measure of
pacification, that general amnesty should be pro?
claimed, regardless of other considerations ; but
there is too much pressure brought to bear on
Congress at this time concerning the condition
of Georgia, and other kindred subjects, for any
display of magnanmity to be expected from the
Radical members.
For the information of persons seeking to have
their political disabilities removed, we would sug?
gest that they be not deterred by this contemplated
action af Congress. And further that it is neces?
sary, in sending petitions for such relief, that they
shall be accompanied by the sworn statement of
the petitioner, setting forth the reasons upon
which he asks to be relieved.
The following is the bill introduced by the mem*
ber from Ohio:
Be it enacted, That upon the ratification of the
proposed fifteenth article of amendment to the
Constitution of the United States by the Legisla?
tures of three fourths of the States, all legal and
political disabilities imposed by the fourteenth ar?
ticle of amendment to the Constitution of the Uni?
ted States, shall by operation hereof be removed
from all persons subject thereto, who shall have
been at the date of said vote, citizens and actual
residents of any Slate, the Legislature of which
shall have voted to ratify said fifteenth article bf
amendment; provided, however, the provision
hereof shall not apply to any person who shall
have been indicted for any crime committed in or
in aid of the late rebellion, nor to any person, who
during said rebellion was guilty of cruelty or in?
humanity to any prisoner of war held, or offering
to surrender as such, nor to any person who aided,
abetted or countenanced the assassination of Abra?
ham Lincoln.
THE NEW CIRCUIT JUDGES.
The most important act of the Administration
since the re-assembling of Congress has been the
appointment of nine Circuit Judges, authorized
by the act passed at the last session. The purpose
of this act. is to relieve the Judges of the Supreme
Court from the performance of Circuit duty, as
the growth of the country, together with the num?
ber and importance of the cases coming before
that Court, are quite sufficient to occupy the whole
attention of the Judges.
The following are the nominations made by the
President, together with the Circuits, as at pres?
ent constituted :
Gkohgk F. Suepley, of Maine, as Judge of the
First C ircuil, embracing Maine, New Hampshire,
Massachusetts and Rhode Island.
Lewis B. Woouedff, of New York, Judge of
the Second, embracing Connecticut, Vermont and
New York.
Wm. McKexnaN, of Pennsylvania Judge of the
.Third, embracing New Jersey, Pennsylvania and
Debiware.
GKoiioE A. Pearce, of Maryland, Judge- of the
Fourth, embracing Maryland, Virginia, West Vir
; giaia, North and South Carolina.
Wm. B. Woods, of Alabama, Judge of the Fifth,
embracing Georgia, Alabama, Florida, Louisiana,
Mississippi and Texas.
Gkoiiqe A. Yeaman, of Kentucky, Judge of the
Sixth, embracing Michigan, Ohio, Kentucky and
Tennessee
Thomas Duummond, of Illinois, Judge of the
Seventh, embracing Indiana, Illinois and Wiscon?
sin.
Jonx F. Diixox, of Iowa, Judge of the
Eighth, embracing Missouri, Iowa, Minnesota,
Arkansas, Nebraska and Kansas.
Lorenzo Sawyer, of California, Judge of the
Ninth, embracing California, Oregon and Nevada.
CONGRESSMAN H?GE.
We have heard very little concerning this noted
individual for a long time. He has gone to Wash?
ington, of course, and is now enjoying the profits
and emoluments of a position to which he wa? nev?
er elected. The senior editor of the Chester Re?
porter has been to Columbia lately, and has gained
a little information about Hooe which will prove
interesting to that gentleman's "unwilling constitu?
ents, and hence we publish it. After expressing
the opinion that Hooe is worthy to be classed
among tho meanest of the Radical camp, the edi
to? of the Reporter narrates the following sequel
to his flight from Anderson on that memorable
night in October:
The following statement of facts shows Hoge's
Yankee smartness, and illustrates the theory that
our present State government is only another
name for legalized robbery.
In the fall of 18C8, when H?ge made his rapid
retreat from some point in the Northwestern part
of the State, and reached the cars after a race of
fifteen miles, nil covered with cockle burs and
beggar's lice, thus showing howlitilohc had stood
on the order of his going, but had gone at once
through briar patches and old fields, ho repaired
at once to Scott in Columbia and gave him a full
and perhaps exaggerated description of tho dan?
gers he had passed, and of the terrible fright im?
aginary Ku Kluxcs had subjected him to. Scott,
loved him for the dangers ho had passed through,
and felt that Congress would likewise feel an at?
tachment for him t herefor. It. was too good a oard
to lose, and it was determined that the martyr
should proceed at once to Washington, and, by a
recital uf his exploits, be a living witness of the
existence of the much Imfcd'and feared organiza?
tion. But it happened Hogo was out of money,
and upon Scott the duty of staking him devolved.
As iho State Treasury is in his estimation a mere
party fund, he advanced lingo one hundred and
fifty dollars out of the contingent fund, and sent
him on his way lying and rejoicing. Soon there?
after Wallace, the A. $.. goes to Washington for
the purpose of poking his long nose into the
House of Representatives. Upon his arrival Hogo
represented to him that ho had been there for
sonio timo advancing their joint interests?that he
had expended one hundred and fifty dollars of his
private funds while ho employed, nnd suggested
tho propriety of his dividing tho expense with
him. Wallace agreed to do so, but postponed pay?
ment for a while. On hu return to tho State ho
discovered the attempted speculation, and refused
to ante H?ge has, therefore, scattcrcu to tho
winds the old theory that there is honor among
thieves. Tom Robertson has no hesitation in say?
ing that H?ge is ad?d rascal. Could human deg?
radation reach & lower pilch than Hue.

SOUTH CAROLINA MONUMENT ASSOCIATION.
APPEAL.
Women of South Carolina, there needs no urgent
appeal to your sympathies in a cause so sacred as
that which we now undertake. The great tide of
adversity which has swept overour unhappy land,
has hitherto stifled effort in this direction ; but
not, therefore, have our hearts ceased to beat for
the glorious dead. Scarcely is there one among
us whose thought does not, on the first mention of
our object, turn at once, with loving affection, to
some grave which this monument is intended to
honor.
Mothers, widows, sisters, daughters, whose
hearts thus cling to the soldier's grave, let us then
unite with on earnest, loving effort in tbis holy
duty. Lei ctcu- oar lisping little ones be brought
to give their mile to its accomplishment; that
i thus impressed upon their minds, they may never
' forget to love and honor the memory of those who
battled and fell in our cause. If a lost caus
even therefore the more holy. Evea therefote
docs it become the more incumbent upon us, to
bring to this great sacrifice of pure purpose and
1 heroic deed, that homage and veneration which
the world pays only to success.
With the wish that all who haye shared in a
common sorrow, may shore also in the privilege
iof raising this testimonial to our tost heroes, the
annual subscription for membership, is put at the
lowest point practicable; that thas it may be
within the reach of those, who, having little to
give, have still the right, through tears and suf?
fering, to join us in the fulfillment of this most
sacred duty.
To ?D others?sea as well as women, old and
young?to all who cherish tbe name of Carolinian,
and cling with a fond love io> whatever is left to
us of our "good old State," we would say, give
to us freely according to your means ; gite gener?
ously ; give gratefully to the memory of those
who gave their lives for us.

PROCEEDINGS OF CONGRESS.
The speoial correspondent of-the Augusta Chron?
icle and Sentinel give8: the'^oliowing interesting
Washington, Dec. 11.
..-On yesterday the" Judiciary Committee of the
Senate held another session for the purpaseof con?
sidering the present condition-, of affairs existing
in Georgia?'.''- The' meeting was a protracted one
and lasted for several hours. After the examina?
tion of several witnesses of Jbe extreme Radical
stripe with regard to tie lawlessness of the people
of that State and the frequent outrages perpetra?
ted Upon the colored race and the members of the
Republican party, the Committee declared itself
satisfied and determined upon a report to the Sen-.
ate.
This report is to be in the form of a bill and.
will be presented to the Senate at its session on
next Monday morning. The bill will embody the
views of the President on this subject as contain?
ed in his message to Congress. Its provisions are
in substance as follows : First, the Governor of
the State shall be empowered to issue his procla?
mation within a reasonable length of time calling
together the original members of the Legislature
who were elected under the reconstruction acts in
186S; Secondly, the Legislature When convened
shall organize by the members taking tne oath pre?
scribed in the reconstruction laws; and, Thirdly,
no members shall be allowed to lake their seats
who are ineligible under the third section of the
fourteenth amendment.
Governor Bullock was one of the witnesses who
testified before the Committee with regard to the
condition of Georgia. His testimony was of the
srongest kind against allowing the State admis?
sion until I be reconstruction.laws had been com?
plied with. He gave a detailed account of the
outrages perpetrated upon the negroes and Repub?
licans, and did not think that these could live in
the State without receiving protection from Con?
gress.
Although Ibis bill will be reported by the Com?
mittee to the Senate on Monday the Conservatives
here to-night express the opinion that no action
will be taken in the matter for some time yet.
They say that the point will be raised that the
Georgia. Legislature bos not had the opportunity
to reseat the negro members since the decision of
the State Supreme Court was made affirming their
eligibility to office. This side of the question has
already been presented to the attention of the more
moderate members of both Houses and is thought
to have had a good deal of effect.
The Conservatives now believe, that when this
bill is reported a motion will be made to postpone
its consideration until some time in next January,
in order that the Legislature may be given time to
act in the matter, It is thought that this dispo?
sition of the bill will be urged on the ground of
justice, and that a postponement will be carried
On last Thursday, in the House of Representa?
tives, Mr. John Fox (Democrat,) of "New York, in?
troduced a resolution directing an inquiry to be
made into the causes of- the gold conspiracy of last
Fall, and the parties to blame in that transaction.
Both yesterday and to-day the President and Sec?
retary of the Treasury have been using the whole
of their influence with Congressmen for the pur?
pose of preventing the passage of this resolution.
There is no donbt that if it were not for this op?
position the resolution would pass. The Republi?
can members would all vote in its favor but for its
unpleasant reference to Grant. The resolutions
will be called up aqd pressed to ?vofe on Monday,
and it will then be seen what effect Grant's wishes
have upon Congressmen's votes.
The report that Judge Grier has resigned his
seat on the Bench of the Supreme Court is an?
nounced to be premature by his friends. They
say that be has been talking about taking such a
step for some months past, but that be has not ta?
ken it yet. The general opinion is that he has
written out his resignation, but is undecided with
regard to the time when it shall be sent to the
President.
Difpicslttin Edgkfield.?The Augusta Chron?
icle and Sentinel publishes the following correct
version of a difficulty which occurred atEdgefield
C. H. on Wednesday last r
"It appears that on Wednesday morning, be?
tween 11 and 12 o'clock, two men, both intoxica
I ted, got into a quarrel in the -village {not in Hie
circus,) and proceeding fron* words, one of them,
named William Murrel, shot at his antagonist,
James Ramsay, twice with a revolver. Tlw first
shot missed, but the second took effect fa the left
lung, inflicting a serious wound. The man who
was shot was a radical, and the son of the radical
Clerk of the Court for that Oounty.
"When the afternoon performance of the circus
was nearly over, a difficulty occurred under the
canvass between two men, Frank Warren and
Elijah Watson, in which the former strhek the lau
tcr over the head with his own pistol, knocking
him down, hut inflicting no serious injury.
"On Wednesday night, the negro militia at Edge
field Court House, arrested a white man named
Richard Coleman and put him in jail. No one
kn^w what the offence was charged against him,
but it is supposed that he was arrested on suspi?
cion of being a rebel bushwhacker. He was kept
in jail alL night, but released on Thursday morn?

their political disabilities has already passed both
Houses of Congress, and been signed by the
President. Among those relieved, we observe the
name of Thomas J. Webb, of Anderson. ?
? It is stated that Gen. Grant in- tructcd his
door-keeper to say to all visitors, wnile he was
preparing his message, "Not at home." Prentice
thinks there is no hypocrisy in the expression,
either, for Grant is not at all "at home" in prepar?
ing a Presidential message.
? Mississippi and Texas returns, though not
yet complete, seem to leave.no doubt that General
Alcorn, the Republican candidate for Governor in
Mississippi, and Genera) Hamilton, the Conserva?
tive Republican candidate for the same position in
Texas, are each erected by large majorities.
