The President’s Message. 1 s
It woalil be useless for us to crowd j v

of this important document, deliver- 1*
ed to Congress Monday afternoon, (
last. Wo are pnrsuaJed that not ,
many will be disappointed, win!# the , I
greater number will be better pleas- (
ed with the following impartial re
port, condensed from the Baltimore
San :
The Third Annual Message of
President Grunt, opens with a reiver- *
ation of the policy announced in liis 1
Inaugural Message. “The policy 1
has been not to inquire into the wis* 1
doui of the laws alvea ly enacted, '
but to learn their spirit and intent, 1
and to enforce them accordingly.
The exceptional calamities by fire 1
and Hood which have marked the 1
past year, and which have led to the 1
display of so much active benevo- :
lenee and generous sympathy at 1
borne and abroad, receive appropri- '
ate mention, while the year is recog
nized to have been, “under a wise
Providence, one of general prosper
ity to the nation.”
Under the bead of Foreign Rela
tions, the country is properly con
gratulated upon the beneficial effects
likely to result from the treaty of
Washington, both as a settlement of
our differences with Great Britain,
and as an example to the world how
wars may be avoided without a sac
rifice of national honor. i
Some surprise will doubtless be
felt to find M. Catacazy elevated to
the dignity of a national grievance.
The abolition of slavery by Brazil j
is made the subject of presidential
congratulation, and the enactment
by Congress of a stringent law is
recommended to reach the case of
American citizens who in their busi
ness dealings with planters and oth
ers iu countries where slavery is
j still tolerated by law, may become
interested as mortgages or otherwise
in this species of property.
The rumors which have been rife
of pending difficulties with Spain,
! and possible intervention in the al
; fairs of Cuba, find no countenance
:in what is said in the message upon
these heads.
; Turning from foreign to domestic
1 affairs, the first and most important
; recommendation of the message is
1 that both the tariff and internal laws
: are modified, with a view to lighten
ing the burdens at present imposed
upon the country. It is recommen
ded that "all taxes from internal
revenue sources be abolished, except
those collected from spirituous, vi
j nous and malt liquors, tobacco in its
various forms, and from stamps,”
which amounts to a recommendation
to abolish the income tax. In any
re-udjiistmcnt of the tariff it is rec
ommended that those articles not
’ produced at home, but which enter
i largely into general consumption
I through medicines, compounds, &c.,
• and from which little revenue is de
; rived, should be placed on the free
l list, and that “should a further re
. duetioti be deemed advisable, it
< should be made upon those articles
1 which can best bear it without dis
turbing home production or reducing
' the wages of American labor.”—
' This latter recommendation has the
- merit of being so exceedingly gen
- eral that it probably will give no of
- fence even to the most ardent pro
-1 tcctionists. For particulars upon
this head Congress is referred to the
t report of the Secretary of the Treas
- ury. The fluctuations in the curren
s cy are deplored, and the wisdom of
i. Congress is invoked to find a rente
l> dy. The message reiterates the
n condemnation heretofore pronounced
i- by the Secretary of the Treasury
i upon the present infamous system
i- of moieties to informers in the revo
lt' nue service of the country.
* In the navy the employment of
supernumerary officers in the mer
s cliatit service, (as in England and
i- other countries,) and that promo
s tion above the rank of captain be
s made by selection instead of senior
-1 i ity (as at present) are to be recoin
„ j men lotions worthy the attention ol
I i Congress.
f ; Tiie plan of uniting the telegraph
r) i service with the ordinary postal ser
-1 vice of the country is urged upon
. | the favorable consideration of Con
, 1 gress as recommended by the l’ost
.’ J master General. The revenues ol
J j ilit- department continue to improve.
The measures taken for the en
i ' forcemeat of the lvu-Klux law are
I next reviewed The proclamation
uf October 17, is justified upon the
j ground that the requirements of the
r proclamation of October 12, requir
i/ ! ing the members of unlawful combi
| imlioCK with in five days to surren
■ der “all their arms, amunitioii, uni
" I forms, disguises, and other means
i and implements used by them for
4 carrying out their unlawful purpo
j sea” had not Lect: complied with.
The suppression of polygamy in
' Utah, with a provision for the logiti
*■ i mir.at.ion of -'innocent children” tip
to a certain dale, is suggested—the
latter only “as a suggestion, not a
e recommendation.”
II The “peace policy ’ heretofore
1 adopted by the administration with
- 1 reference to the Indians, is recom
mc.;dcd to be adhered to, "nut only
I becausi it is humane, Cliristian-l-ike
’ | and econo. v, ical, but because it is
r right.”
I’olitical amnesty is recommended
upon the ground, apparently, that
no goo I comes from excluding a
particular class of men from office
because they bad violated their oath
Itn support the conrtitutiou, while
' I thousands who would have done so
i had they been in tiie same position
| are admitted to be eligible. It is
n i added, “if there are any great crim
inals distinguished above all others
for the part they took in opposition
1 'to the government, they might, in
' • the judgement of Congress, be ox
■ eluded from such amnesty.” Rc
-1 grot is expressed that tiie old citi
' zens of th i Southern States should
■ not take a more prominent part ill
public affairs.
In conclusion, the President de
clares liimsell in favor ..of such civil
service rvlbriu as wiji visit the te
spungitiility fur bd appointments
upon those who recommend improp- j
er persons for office to the appoint- B
power. He refers to the com- 1 j
mission appointed muter the act of ( j
Congress of March 31, 1371, to de-
rise regulations for the reform of
the ciril > rvire, arid promise* to
give to the experiment a fair trial. '
Taken as a whole, the message is .
of moderate length, simple at d un- 1:
pretentious in its style.
An afTecting incident—reportedhy \
the Racine Journal: “The other
day a father and son were dressing
a hog, the father chopping. By a
miutrokc, instead of splitting the
hog open lie split his son’s hand. In "
explanation how it happened, to the
doctor, the father exclaimed ; 'lean- ,
not tell a lie, doctor, indeed I can
not. 1 done it with my little hatch
et;.’ The son was deeply moved,
and was hear Ito remark that he 'had "
rather have such a father than a *'
whole slaughter-house full of dead t
” l
Concerning Josh Billings, a cor- j
respondent says: “Of all the comi
cal looking specimens of the gi-nuit \
homo he takes the lead. Tall gaunt,
homely—every motion like that of j*
an elephant deliberating wether or |
not he shall cross a dangerous place l
• —but with a face lit up with good
common sense—friendly intercourse 1
and fun enough for the nation—lie,*
is at once the embodiment of ugli- ;
1 ness and beauty. He is the hand
somest homely man l ever saw in *
my lift:.” \
j The New York Herald tells alj
charming story of the vagaries com
mitted by the reporters’ table at
Plymouth Church. At times this ta- '
ble assumed almost a aalutatory ear
nestness, curiously corresponded ,
with the outflow of the currents of
Beecher theology. Whenever the
preacher made an effective perora
tion he thrilled the tablo a* well as
his hearers, whilo in seasons of mere
ly ordinary interest tho tablo bad
scarcely a pcrcoptible motion.
