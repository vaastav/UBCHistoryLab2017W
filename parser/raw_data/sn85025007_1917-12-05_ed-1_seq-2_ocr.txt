WILL WAR ON AUSTRIA.
The message of President Wilson
lo Congress yesterday, rin . which h .
urged a declaration of war on 'Aus-;
tria, surprised no wcil-posted Amor-!
ienn. Many, including prominent
Congressmen, thought this act:oi.|
should have been taken some time ago.
Like messages heretofore sent
Congress by Mr. Wilson, it was o
the point and practically unanswer
able.
Systematic hostile and surreptitious
unneutral acts on1 the part of Aus-(
tria-Hungary have driven this coun
try to the exact position she was In
with regard to Germany before 'he'
declaration of war on April <>, lf'17.
Sac pursued ruthless submarine war-'
fare, although 0:1 much smaller seal.
'ban Germany. She carried on a pro
paganda of disloyalty To tliiS' coun
iry just like Germany. She used her
diplomatic agents in the Unite;-.
States to foment- discord, incendiar
ism and destruction. Dr. Constantino
Dumba was sent out of this country
bees use he was concerned in starl
ing strikes, and fires in munition-:
factories in this country.
The President, however, still
?? :'<ls the olive branch and appea r.
?!? .-reasonable people in the centrai
empires. lie says when the Gorman
people have spokesmen whose. wo: I
we can believe and when those
..pokesmen are ready in the name of

JUVENILE COURT.
There were two cases l/c
Police Court this morning. The t e
fendants were five boys?four w -
one colored. The wh^te ^io were
charged with stealing
been brought into, court by Offi ~r
Snellings, but he hud been unable
to ascertain the name of the ownc
of the wire. The colored boy had.
been taken from the platform o? ?
electric train which he had uoarucu
on south Royal street tor the purine
It obtaining a free ride. His motner
was in court, and he being but twcUc;
voars old, he was turned over to h -.
"for correction. She ?s;ho??:i
told that should she fail to pi 0
him from committing misdemeanor^,
the authorities would take charge .
should he be brought to cour.
airain. * i
The four white boys had .procured
wire somewhere and disposed of i
to a junk dealer. Their ages ranged
from nine to twelve veins o '
anil their parents appeared in -
with them. After the evidencej in U
case had been heard, also confcssic;s
of the juvenile offenders, then 1
,.nfs were assured that if tney co ?
no! control them, the authorities
;0uld. and that they must see to d
tint their offsprings dcpoit

The most troublesome cases wn.vii
come before the Police Court an:
those of juvenile oTcmdersThcP.--;

Justice Crutchfield. of Ricomonu.
?ume time ago adopted a role by
which he held parents ri-sponsible
Tur the acts of their offspring. A
boy who was armed with a cat ride
had been using the same m ?
streets notwithstanding the protests
of neighbors. He was finally arrest
and brought before Justice Cru.cn
ficM, who ascertained that the ii.U
had been given him by his father.
The latter was summoned into court
and fined ten dollars for furnis.mg
Ins offspring with the weapon.
.The mother of one of the youi
stors. observed this morning that ncr
boy committed overt acts wnlie goi.-.g
to * and returning from school at sum
times being out of her sight, toe
word pedagogue in ancient ?sa>*
meant a servant who accompanied a
pupil to and from school in order to
m,toot him from ill-treatment *r
insults. In our day if would seem tha.
pedagogues might he used witn pro
fit in order to keep.pupils from com
mitting unlawful acts in going to or
returning from school.
A I'STUIA CULPABLE.
he Neur Freic I'rosse, of Vienna, |
is correct in saying' that overtures
for peace between Austria and Eng- ?
lard should be opened by the former,-;
but this is not because o. any mis-:
understandings between Germany and 1
England since the death of Queen
?Victoria, which have nothing what
ever to do with the case.
As the Philadelphia Record says, I
any peace negotiations should be?
gun bv Austria because it is the j
h a 1'ng criminal. It was Austria;
which nearly precipitated the world !
v.-.-r by it- appropriation of Bosnia!
in iOOS. It was Austria which ? would j
have precipitated the-world''war in:
Ai gust. l!?t-'!. 10 months before the i
assassination of the- Austrian Arch- j
duke, because the Balkan wars Ind j
resulted in weakening the German
ally. Turkey, and in strengthening!
the Russian protege. Servia. A us-1
uia refrained on that occasion only >
because Italy would not join, and!
Germany still had a few more mili-1
ir.ry preparations to make before .it
was qui*e ready to back Austria in !
a world war. These Germany made (
i: the spring of 19Id. and then it was ,
ready fcr war.
.t wa> Austria which sent to Ser-'
via. on account cf a murder commit
ted in Austrian territory, such an
ultimatum as no Government ever
addressed to another, and refused to
accept the Servian reply, which was !
abject in its acceptance of all the;
Austrian demands but one. and only I
w.shed some further discussions of I
that one. It was Austria which re- i
fused to extend the -IS hours of the
ultimatum 0'* to delay the movement[
of its army. Every effort at peace!
bv negotiation was flouted.
And new that Austria and Ger-j
many have failed to enforce their
sort of peace upon the world by the
sword, they are eager to obtain peace
by 'negotiation. It is certainly
Austria's place to ask for peace
I'VIYU-. Bu! ;it tlu: SM'po t?m<- :i Bud j
apcst paper is demanding 9273 square
miles of Rumania, the joint control
with Bulgaria of the Danube, the
abolition of the Serriah army and
the maintenance of some dummy
of Austria as King of Servia. The
war will go on until Austria and Ger
many get into a different state of
mirvd. So long as they are in their
present mood, peace "with them would
not. last long enough to be worth
getting.
WILL BELGIUM BE REPEATED?
(Richmond Times-Dispatch)
European dispatches announce
Germany's determination to seize
Denmark, overrun it and possibly
swallow it up in order to counter the
allies' reported move in establishing
a naval base on the Norwegian coast.
This story comes straight from Co
penhagen, reciting the alarm of the
Danes ;-?d an appeal from them L<>
I he entente to prevent their sacrifice
to German ruthlessness.
The truth is, Norway has granted
nc concessions whatever to the al
lies; no naval base is about to be oc
cupied by them on Norwegian soil
and no occasion exists for German
aggression against Denmark. Both
N(?rwav and Denmark have main
tained their neutrality from t'ne be
ginning of the war, notwithstanding
tb:* ?'.ivages which Germany has
perpetrated against those small na
tions. But it is evident that Germany
anticipates a concerted naval drive
once the American battle fleet takes
its station in European waters, and
in order to fortilv itself against this,
it is seeking some pretext upon
which Denmark may be Rolgianizcd.
Once that country is invaded by Ger
many, the Danes know that the Ger
mans would not quit it- at the point
< f the sword.
For half a century Germany lias
had its greedy eyes fixed upon Den
ji.i'iii. Belgium and Holland. It. has
coveted an opportunity to wipe these
sjv-all states from the map, absorb
ing them as Bavaria, Alsace and Lor
laine were absorbed, but no peaceable
means has ever offered itself for the
execution of German designs upon its
neighbors. No sooner was war de
clared against France, however, than
Belgium was overrun and all of it oc
cupied except a strip of territory in
Flanders. Holland has saved itself
by allowing Germany to use it as a
channel through which neutral mar
kets beyond were reached. Denmark
?"vasrieft alcne for a time, but there
seems no doubt that, it was marked
for slaughter when "military neces
sity" should arise.
Whether or net Germany now con
eludes that that necessity exists prob
ably will be determined within a short
time. Nor will it matter whether or
not Norway remains neutral. Bel
gium was neutral, but that did no*
save it. and Norway's neutrality will
not save Denmark if Germany feels
that the time lias arrived "or another
conquest.
