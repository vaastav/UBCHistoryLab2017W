Once again those elected to rep
resent the various states of the
United States in the halls of Con-
have assembled at the Na-
tional Capitol
to begin the
closing ses
sion of the
Congress Convenes
for Closing Session
Fifty-ninth Congress. While noth
ing remarkable or unusual is ex
pected to happen between now and
the 4th of March, 1909, when it
will pass into history, yet the
members of the present body hope
to so completely clear the legisla
tive boards by that time that they
will be able to plunge into the tar
iff reduction tussle, which the
country was promised by the eani
. paigners before the election, as
soon as the present Congress dies
and the new one born and will
have been culled together by
President Taft. While to the
average lay citizen it might ap
pear that the country is being
legislated to death, yet there is
always imminent need of the pres
ence of Congress to patch this or
that piece of legislation which, ow
ing to the size <md progress of the
. country, has sprung aleak: to pass
Buew legislation in order to meet
'unforeseen emergencies that have
arisen on account of the rapid
development of the country, and
finall^ to kill off certain legisla
tion that is no longer applicable.

dress. While the message was not
of a pathetic nature, yet it did make recommendations
that the president knew could not be acted upon before
the present Congress, as well as himself, officially died
next March. It was not as long as previous ones, but it
bristled with pertinent points bearing on the general
good of the country as he seemed to see them, a great
many of which were brought out by the work that was
begun by him some time ago and made more visible by
tie late campaign. President-elect Taft, upon assuming
the duties of the presidency of the United States, could
not do better than to at least re-recommend the most of
the salient points which were recommended by President
Roosevelt in his recent message-, and then see to it that
they are favorably acted upon, even if he has to use the
Roosevelt big stick in order to succeed. The message
recommends federal control of interstate corporations;
railways put under complete control of the intei-state
commerce commission; telegraph and telephone com
panies likewise controlled; better employers' liability
laws; a weekly half holiday for all laborers during sum
mer months; doubling the salaries of federal judges; the
cheeking of the abuse of issuing temporary injunctions;
national forest policy indorsed; the improvement of in
land waterways; the establishment of postal savings
banks; more money for the bureau of education; the
census appointees placed under civil service rules;
the government printing office placed under the depart
ment of commerce and labor; soldiers' homes placed un
der control of the war department; the immediate admis
sion of Arizona and New Mexico; federal control of inter
state fisheries; American citizenship conferred upon the
people of Porto Rico; the withdrawal of Uncle Sam's
army from Cuba within two months, and many other less
important measures.
The city of Los Angeles, according to the Times of
that city, is in the throes of a garbage collecting contro
versy, and the authorities, who had thought the city would
make a barrel of money by handling the proposition itself,
are in the position of the Irishman
who grabbed hold of the horns of
a mad bull to show his friends how
strong he. was, but realized after he

had caught the bull the predicament he would be in when
be attempted to turn it loose, and soon began to pray for
his friends to help him let go of the animal. After three
years' trial of the city collecting and burning of the
garbage, the authorities have come to the conclusion that,
it costs twice as much for the city to do the work as it
would for a private concern to do it. The city's in
cinerator, purchased at a cost of .s'Bo,ooo, has proven an
expensive luxury, and the city is now seeking to get some
private concern to take the garbage contract and pur
chase the incinerator at one-half of its original cost. The
city of Seattle might profit by the experience of Los
Angeles and begin to hedge now on its garbage collecting
proposition before it will have lost ten times more than
it has already spent. By those who have given the sub
ject much thought, it is believed that a private concern
in Seattle could collect the refuse of the city at one-half
the cost to the taxpayers than if done by the city.
The condition of Los Angeles should be looked into before
the city of Seattle goes further toward putting in a system
of its own.
At a public meeting held in the city of Greater New
York not many days ago, in which men and women, par
ticipated, the crjminology of the Negro in the political
world was being discussed when the audience was startled

white blood is now so mixed with black blood that the

broadly speaking, will have a strain of Negro blood in

number of mixed bloods of white
and black parentage lias increased
from a few hundred thousand at
the time of the emancipation to
nearly four million at the present
time, and yet no one can be
charged directly with having
brought this about. The white
man pretends to be fighting the
miscegenation of the whites and

taking human life if his women
do not live up to his dogma, but
forgets all about his beautiful the
ory when the ride comes up to
him, and as a result the mulatto
population of the country has in
creased a thousandfold since the
emancipation.

fallen women, who will be the
consorts of fallen and disreputa-
I ble men, as well as men who wear
the "holier than thou" mask. If there be no district
where large numbers of the more brazen and vicious are
herded together, these fallen women will flourish just the
same. On the other hand, if a district is set aside for
them and if every available space allotted to them be occu
pied, there will still be thousands of them roaming around
among the chaste and upright persons. In view of the
fact that the "bad" seems to be omnipresent, the ques
tion naturally arises, "Is there any specific need of a dis
trict being set apart for lewd women, where they can
be sought by vicious men?" It is certainly a debatable
question, and The Seattle Republican would be glad to
get your opinion on the subject. To herd vicious women
into one district and permit the same class of men to go
and live where fancy leads them is an unfair proposition,
and is, in short, class legislation and should not be toler
ated. But a few days ago two young married men sat
talking to each other. "My wife leaves Saturday for a
three months' visit with friends and relatives," said one.
"In that case I suppose you will either fake rooms at a
down-town hotel or a house of ill-fame," was the startling
reply of his companion. In reply to the latter question,
the first young man declared he had not fully decided
which he would do. Had the same remark been made
concerning his wife the other fellow's life blood would
have paid for the insult, and yet he is a companion of his
wife, and his wife has as much moral right to spend her
vacation at some house of ill-fame as he, and on returning
be considered by her husband just as angelic as the man
who had either taken rooms at a house of ill-fame during
his wife's absence or spent a great many of his leisure
hours therein.
The editor of The Seattle Republican raises a mourn
ful wail because of the lynching of three Negroes the day
before Thanksgiving, and the apparent apathy of the
governor of Tennessee. Need we tell any man why those
"niggers" were lynched? No! He
says that no one interfered. Cer
tainly not! The lynching watt not
done in a moment of high passion.
