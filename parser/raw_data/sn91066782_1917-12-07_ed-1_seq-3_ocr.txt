Convincing Proof of This Fact
, Kidgway, Tenn. "I suffered from female
trouble with backache and paiu in my side for over
seven months so I could not do any of my work. I
was treated by three different doctors and was
getting discouraged when my sister-in-law told me
how Lydia E. Pinkham's Vegetable Compound had
helped her. I decided to try it, and it restored my
health, so I now do all of my housework which is
not light as I have a little boy three years old."

Mrs. Lindsey Now Keeps House For Seven.
Tennille, Ga. "I want to tell you how much I have been benefited
by Lydia K Pinkham's Vegetable Compound. About eight years ago I
got in such a low state of health I was unable to keep house for three in
thefaAjiy. I had dull, tired, dizzy feelings, cold feet and hands nearly
all the time and could scarcely sleep at all The doctor said I had a
severe case of ulceration and without an operation I would always
be an invalid, but I told him I wanted to wait awhile. Our druggist
advised my husband to get Lydia E. Pinkham's Vegetable Compound
and it has entirely cured me. Now I keep house for seven and work
in the garden some, too. I am so thankful I got this medicine. I feel
as though it saved my life and have recommended it to others and
they have been benefited". Mrs. W. E. Lindsey, R. R. 3, Tennille, Ga.

Interesting Letters from Everett H. Wal
do to His Parents Here.
The followinsi is made up of extracts I me,
from three letters received by Mr. and pay while we are over here, for the Eng-
Washington. Dec. 7. The interstate
commerce commission, incidentally sup
ported by the administration, has staged
in Congress, a bitter fight between con
servatives and radicals xver the railroad
question. In its unexpected recommen
dation ' that the railrouds unify them
selves and conduct their operations
throughout the war as one organization,
the commission has given evidence of its
recognition of a crisis which must result
either in such a plan as is outlined or in
government ownership. This crisis has
been approaching slowly, through the
extraordinary demands upon the rail
roads and the hesitancy to, permit them
to increase their rates for several years
before the United States entered the war.
With the coming of the war the trans
portation systems practically broke
down because during the long regime of
unsympathetic and hampering legisla
tion, capital had avoided the railroad
field and the roads were unable to extend
their facilities. fcionie of the influences
operating against the roads, notably in
Congress, have been determined upon a
narrow and ungenerous policy toward
them for the purpose of forcing govern
ment ownership.
The same elements in Congress which
have led in this policy of spoliation, as
it may be termed, will now unite to op
pose any. loans to the railroads such as
the interstate commerce commission pro
poses in addition to such increases of
freight rates as may be granted. As
these dispatches have pointed out before
the railroad managers could not surren
der their properties to a system of uni

Washington, Dec. 7. The interallied
conference in Paris has decided to create
an international organization to co-ordinate
the utilization of transport facil
ities. In this way, without hampering
the employment ot the various nations
resources, it is planned for them to re
strict their imports, to be- released for
the carrying of American troops.
The conference provided for an inter
allied committee to carry out the de
cisions of the body with regard to unity
of action in the production of war man
ufactures, such as armament and air
planes by way of avoiding duplications,
and for specialization by the various na
tions in the branches of production for
which they are best fitted.

The Need of Economy and Saving.
When we put a million and a half sol

from productive enterprises. They do
not while they are actually in training
or in service produce anything. I hey do,
on the other hand, consume much, There
is nothing more expensive on earth than
to support and maintain a great army in
the field, especially if it is on the fight

America is the one great remaining

"You ran find my location by looking

I am getting into an interesting country.
The trains travel very fast here. I don't

magnates, own the railroad properties of
the country, that the failure of railroad
dividends would impoverish thousands of
stockholders of the middle class and that
the railroad managements have no right
to wreck their properties in the alleged
public interest when such wreckage
means not only the ruin of the transpor
tation system itself but of the men and
women who have invested their money
in it.
For these reasons railroad unification
and government loans to railroads go
hand in hand. This is the nub of the
whole question of operating the railroads
to the best advantage for war purposes.
Congress either can force government
ownership at a time when it would add
immensely to the burdens and embar
rassments of the officials charged with
the conduct of the war, or it can adopt
the businesslike policy of welding the
roads temporarily into one powerful and
flexible instrument of war, which shall
not lack for support during the war (or
suffer destruction as a result of nation
alization. The I nited States is loaning
hundreds of millions of dollars to build
up the railroads of Russia, France and
other European country belligerents, yet
there are men in both houses of the
American Congress who would vote
against loaning a dollar to sustain the
railroads at home, notwithstanding that
should they fail the war would fail. Ex
actly the same tests of patriotism as
have been given before in Congress will
now be repeated, with the railroad ques
tion as the issue. Fortunately no di
vision upon partisan lines need be expect
ed upon this issue. Congress has formed
a patriotic coalition tor tne conduct or
the war which might well he emulated in
other parts of the national capital.

All Depends on Corn.
Durham, N. H., Dee. T. Huntley N.
Spaulding, speaking Wednesday to the
students of New Hampshire college, said
that in all probability ouc great corn
crop would be the saving crop in this
war. He pointed out that there was a
deficit of more than 100,000,000 bushels
of wheat in the allied countries in Eu
rope and that we, by the strictest econ
omy and the substitution of corn for
wheat, might be able to supply the lark.
He declared that unless we are able to do
so the war is lost. Mr. Spaulding was
