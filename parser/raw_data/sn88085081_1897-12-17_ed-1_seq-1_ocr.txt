Now - a - days nearly
every woman rides a
bicycle. The majority
of these who do not.
h nyujg vainly
■to conquer the wheel
Ifor weeks, have finally
P given it up as a hope
less task for this one
reason.
In nearly every in
stance severe nervous
ness in women may be
traced to weakness and
disease of the delicate
- . vi me ucncaie
and important organs distinctly feminine.
No other class of disorders so torture a wo
man’s nerves or break them down so
quickly and effectually. Dr. Pierce’s Fa
vorite Prescription is a sure, speedy and
permanent cure for all troubles of this de
scription. It acts directly On the sensitive
organs concerned, making them strong,
healthy, vigorous and elastic. It allays
inflammation, heals ulceration, soothes
pain and tones and builds up the nerves.
It stops exhausting drains. It banishes the
indispositions that precede maternity and
makes baby’s advent easy and almost pain
less. It insures the little new-comer’s
health and an ample supply of nourish
ment. It transforms weak, nervous inva
lids into strong, healthy, nerve-steady wo
men. Thousands have testified to its mar
velous merits. An honest dealer will not
offer a substitute.
“My wife was troubled with ‘female weak
ness’ for several years.” writes James Caswell,
Esq., of Ocheltree, Johnson Co., Kans., (P O.
Box si). “She haa bearing-down pains and
pain in back. Her periods were irregular, she
would have fainting spells, the best doctors did
her no good. By the time my wife had taken
four bottles of the ‘Favorite Prescription’ she
was completely cured. No more pain. Her
monthly periods are regular, she is s'.out and
strong. When she commenced taking your
medicines she weighed about 125 pounds— "now
she weighs 160 pounds.”

DARKNESS SEEMED FAMILIAR.
Vonug Woman In the Front Did Not No
tice That the Light Was Out.
They were on a tandem, and a
straight, smooth road stretched away
before them through the park for a mile
or more. There was darkness all
about, thick, impenetrable darkness,
which lay heavy among the trees, and
betrayed the fact that the authorities
had neglected the electric lights, count
ing on a moon that had failed to keep
her engagements.
But they did not mind the darkness.
Tirfaet, they rather sought out the more
shadowy portions. 'For there is some
thing about a tandem, if it steers easi
ly, which softens the iron-bound laws
of custom. The riders are so close to
gether. anyway. And if tire one .on the
roar seat leans slightly forward, and
the one on the front seat leans just a
little back, there is no need to sigh for
tin* best of hammocks.
The young man on the rear seat had
leaned slightly forward. Moreover, the
young woman on the front seat had
leaned just a little back. And there was
more on the young woman’s lips than
microbes.
Suddenly they were arrested by a
shout— it is said that park policemen
never arrest anyone in any other way —
a deep, full bodied shout that boded ill.
“Hi! You! Where's your lamp?”
They stopped and dismounted. With
a burly policeman in the road there was
nothing else to do.
“Where's your lamp?” the officer de
manded.
They examined the front of the wheel
together. The lantern had gone out.
“Why,” said the young woman, “why,
I never noticed that it wasn’t lit. I —l
must have imagined that we were in
the parlor at home.” —Chicago Tribune.
A Final Kemcdy.
A young lady once, called on one of
Louisville’s most prominent homoeo
pathic physicians, and after discoursing
on all the topics of interest of the day,
settled down to tell her aid incuts. Among
other things, she said that she was
greatly annoyed with a sinkaig feel
ing. The physician prepared a little
bottle of pills and gave them to her,
with minute directions as to how they
should be taken. The woman again
began to talk, and after many vain ef
forts to get her out, she started for the
door. She had just opened it, when
she turned and said: “Oh, doctor, what
shall I do if these pills do not cure me?”
“Take the cork,” he retorted; “they
tell me that’s good for a sinking feel
ing.”—San Francisco Argonaut.
HOW TO FIND OUT.
Fill a bottle or common glass with
urine and let it stand twenty-four
hours; a sediment indicates an un
healthy condition of the kidneys,
when urine stains is evidence
of kidney troubles. r pßfc Irtiqpent de

The great sympathy felt for the
bereavement of President McKinley
tinged the assembling of Congress
with unusual sadness, which not even
the great interest felt in the strong
message of the President could dissi
pate. There were the usual crowds in
the galleries of both House and Sen
ate, but the sorrow expressed in the
faces of Senators and Representatives
was reflected in the facesof the visitors
above them. There is something in
the death of one’s mother that appeals
to the sympathies of others as does
the death of no other relative.
Had President McKinley followed
the example of bis immediate prede
cessor, who rarely finished one of his
messages to Congress until the day
before Congress met, his message
would not have been ready, but he
completed the message a week ago,
and did not have that on his mind
while traveling to the bedside of his
stricken mother, from which he re
turned to Washington to perform the
duties incumbent upon him at the
opening of the session of Congress. As
soon as those duties were performed
he started for Canton again, to per
form a more painful duty, carrying
with him the sorrowful sympathies
of the whole country.
Three P’s, patriotism, peace and
prosperity from the keynote of Presi
dent McKinley’s annual message to
Congress. His treatment of the an
nexation of Hawaii, the Cuban and
other foreign questions, including that
of commercial reciprocity, is patriotic
to the core, without the slightest trace
of jingoism, and his treatment of the
financial'and other domestic questions
is that of a man who only desires that
which will continue and increase the
prosperity the country is qow begin
ning to enjoy.
In addition to getting a first class
man to fill the important position of
Attorney General, President McKin
ley’s choice of Gov. John W. Griggs,
of N. J. to fill the vacancy in the Cab
inet that will be made by the nomina
tion of Attorney General McKenna *o
succeed Justice Field, who retired
from the U. S. Supreme Court last
week, aiter having served there longer
than any of his predecessors, is con
sidered to be a good political move-r
--one that will aid materially in keep
ing New’ Jersey in the republican
column, and the wish is general that
Gov. Griggs w’ill accept the tendered
portfolio.
The activity in certain quarters in
efforts to make the public believe that
there is some doubt about the annexa
tion of Hawaii, indicates that some
money is being spent for the purpose
of creating anti-annexation sentiment.
If so, it is being thrown away, as an
nexation is absolutely sure to come
before the close of this session -of Con
gress. Two-thiids of the Senate are
ready at any time to vote for the rati
fication of the annexation treaty, but
the rules of the Senate put it in the
power of the opponents —not more
than twenty at the outside —to
the vote. Should it become apparent
that this power is being used for fili
bustering purposes, annexation will be
secured by legislation, which will only
need a majority vote.
The more conservative element in
Congress is strongly in favor of mak
ing this session as short as possiple.
This sentiment was voiced by Repre
sentative Heatwole, of Minn., when
he said; “In my opinion, this Con
gress should get through its routine
work by May 1, and adjourn. The
smallest amount of legislation will be
of the greatest benefit to the country,
and if we can finish and go home by
that date, a good many millions of our
countrymen will rise up and call us
blessed.” Speaker Reed says he sees
no excuse at present for making the
session a very long one.
Nothing of more general benefit
to the morals of the country has been
done lately than the official announce
ment of the Post Office Department
that the mails would hereaftes be clos
ed to newspapers that print missiug
letter word contests, or any other kind
of advertising matter containing
chance or lottery schemes. Some of
the most daring swindling of the age
has been conducted by this class of
advertisers, all of which violated the
spirit, if not the letter, of to the anti
lotterv law.
Inasmuch as about $20,000,000 will
be expended upon River and Harbor
improvements, under contracts previ
ously made, during the next fiscal
vear, there is quite sMstroug feeling in
Congress in favor of omitting the us
ua 1 River and Harbor Appropriation
bill at this session. No agreement to
thut effect ba* actually been made,
but it will not be surpnsmg should
that be the result of the exchanges of
opinion on the subject now going on.

How They Balse Wheat.
Probably the largest wheat grower
in the state of Washington is W. H.
Babcock, of Eureka Flats, in Walla
Walla comity, on the line of the Wash
ington and Columbia River railroad.
He has now 5,000 acres in wheat.
With a soil of great depth and fer
tility and the conditions of climate
most favorable the one great element
of water was the sole constituency
lacking to make the Eureka Flats the
ideal place for the farmer.
When the Hunt system of railroads
was built into this great region it de
veloped the country rapidly. The
Eureka Flats is the name applied to a
bunch grass valley from three to seven
miles wide and thirty miles long, with
rolling hills on the north from the
break of the Snake river; hills on the
south that form the divide between
the Eureka and Touchet rivers, the
latter still preserving its French pro
nunciation, “Tou-chay,” with the ac
cent on the last syllable.
These hills are little more than high
rolling country. They are all farmed
more or less and are included under
the general title of Eureka Flats.
Between 800,000 and 1,000,000
bushels of wheat were grown on the
Eureka Flats this year, mostly blue
stem.
The railroad company has helped
the farmers out on the water question
by running regular water trains made
up of large tanks on Hat cars, hauled
from ten to thirty miles and soltf at
the rate of $lO for 5,000 gallons. The
fanners haul it from the trains in
large horizontal barrel tanks holding
from 400 to 600 gallons.
Thif water problem was one that ap
pealed to a man of Mr. Babcock’s
make-up for solution, and he went to
prospecting. He has been there for
eighteen years and knows the country
thoroughly. It was some eight or
nine years ago that lie struck -a flow
ing vein of water distunt one and
three-quarter miles from his house.
The well was down 140 feet when the
water was tapped. It is of good qual
ity. In order to have an abundant
supply at all times he drifted ,pu the
vein of water sixty feet, so has
a storage reservoir at the bottom of
the well sixty feet lopg, six feet wide
and six feet deep. The tunnel is well
braced to keep from caving.
From the well an inch and a quar
ter pipe leads to the house, and four
windmills are. used in the water sys
tem. One windmill raises the water
to the large cistern at the surface; a
second one pumps it from the cistern
into the pipe; a third located half a
mile from the cistern, forces the water
along, and a fourth, placed a mile
away, still further helps the distribu
tion.
Men interested in pumps and water
works will understand that there is a
vacum and air chamber at each wind
mill. With a fair breeze a solid flow
of an inch stream is secured.
At his house he has two tanks with
au aggregate capacity of 25,000 gal
lons. He expects to increase the
capacity next spring to 50,000 gallons.
Mr. Babcock has about 100 head of
work- horses employed continuously.
He has forty head of dairy and stock
cattle and forty head of hogs. Be
sides supplying all the water for his
farm and domestic use, he supplies
some the neighboring ranches.
He has two steam threshing outfits
which threshed 275,000 bushela this
season in 55 day’s run, He harvested
4,400 acres of wheat this year, using
headers, averaging thirty bushels to
the acre. It is understood that he
still has upwards of 100,000 bushels of
wheat unsold.
Wheat growing in this state is at
tended with some incidents and care
unknown in some of the other sect
ions. For instance, the seed is dipped
in blue vitriol to prevent smut. Squir
rels aie great poachers on the seed
grain and they have to be regularly
poisoned with a liberal sprinkling of
wheat dosed in strychnine. Estimates
of the cost of growing wheat vary, but,
without counting the investment for
land, it can be done from 30 to 33
cents per bushel.—Ledger.
Land Commissioner Bridges is au
thority for the statement that in some
cases mill operators are appearing at
the auctions of school leases held in
the various counties of western Wash
ington to tender bids on such leases.
It is the belief of this officer that the
intent is to secure possession of tim
bered lands under lease, for the pur
pose of gaining access to thfr timber
growing thereon for shingle mill pur
poses. But the scheme will not work.
Mr. Bridges bolds that the lease con
veyes no tight of removal of growing
timber and does not hesitate to de
clare that he will prosecute anyone
availing himself of such pretext for re
moval of timber from the school lands.

How to Prevent Pneumonia.
At this time of the year a cold is
very easily contracted, and is left to
run its course without the aid of some
reliable cough medicine is liable to re
sult in that dread disease, pneumonia.
We know of no better remedy to cure
a cough or cold than Chamberlain’s
Cough Remedy. We have used it
quite extensively and it has always
given entire satisfaction.— Olagab,
Ind. Ter. Chief.
This is the only remedy that is
known to be a certain preventive of
pneumonia. Among the many thou
sands who have used it for colds and
la grippe, we have never yet learned o!
a single case having resulted in pneu
monia. Persons who have weak lungs
or have reason to fear an attack of
pneumonia, should keep the remedy
at hand. "The 25 and 50 cent sizes for
