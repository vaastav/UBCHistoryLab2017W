.Both hoasw o Joitgrww wra in
bifaf MMt&n to hear President Wil
' anntfbl message. It -was read
by the clerk, for Mr. Wiluon W.
ri lug heeded the advice p his physi--T
iianjiot to appear!' person to pre
sent his address,!
Galleries in bolhr'Scnate and the
Hou3e wore crowded. Bolh thoso
drawn by thtf chance that tho Pres
ident might appear in person or ly
the possibility that his message
might touch upon tho Leaguo of Na
tions question or his own approach
ing retirement to privato lifo were
disappointed.
Mr. "Wilson confined himself al
most wholly to domestio questions.
Only by inference did his message
Tofer to tho ncaring close of his ad
ministration and that was in the
concluding paragraph. Tho propos
als he presented tho President wrote,
wero "not so much a series of re
commendations as a confession of
fc faith in which I was bred and
wnich it is my solemn purposo to
stand by until my last fighting
ay."
Aside from hearing tho President's
message, Congress made out a defi
nite program on at least ono of tho
problems it faces during tho brio!
session. The Houso received a rulo
under which an effort will bo mafic
today to take up tho immigration
bill for prompt action. It would
limit general debate to four hours.
The two-day interval was allowed
to permit Representative Slcgel, ofi
New York, a member of tho Immi
gration Committee! to framo a min
ority report.
No other matter in either Houso
was passed beyond tho committee
: Jrstage. At both ends of tho capitol,
1o deal with business depression, un
employment and farmers' Telief.
iscussions in the Senate of the
plight of farmers delayed the read-
ingpf tho President's message in
that Tody.
Tho dustrial situation found a
placo in the President's message. Re
covery froni war effects gave prom-
Af own fortunate country," Mr. Wil-
on said, and oven hero "halts and
is impeded at times."
A program of immediately serv
iceable acts of legislation to aid that
recovery "and prove thVindestruct
iblo recuperative force of a great
government of the people should
bo undertaken, Mr. Wilson said, ad-
S
afi
"One ofJNwM i ,teprwr,that a
great demqacaiy oaa kep house as
succeMfully and ia as business-like
fashion as any other government."
The President's concrete recom
mendations to Congress in his mes
sago were:
Revision of the tax laws with, sim
plification of tho income and profit
taxes.
Independence vfor the Philippines.
A loan to Armenia.
Economy in government appropri
ations and expenditures and crea
tion of a "workahlo budget system."
Cold storngo and other lnws nf
focting tho cost of living and fed
eral licensing of corporations as
recommended in previous messages.
Rehabilitation and training of dis
abled soldiers and sailors.
First among tho recommended
steps Mr. Wilson placed cnadtment
of a "workable budget system." Ho
said he had vetoed the budget bill
passed at tho last session, "reluct
antly" and because of a "constitu
tional pbjectibn," but ns it was later
revised in the ITouse, ho believed it
would, with other measures, furnish
"foundations for a national budget
system."
Mr. Wilson cited figures as to. tho
national debt and' urged "rigid econ
omy" in which all branches of tho
government should co-operate.
"I cannot over-Y-nphasize," ho
said, "tho necessity of economy in
government appropriations and ex
penditures and the avoidance by
Congress of practices which take
money 'from the Trensury by indef
inite or revolving fund appropria
tions." z
This year's estimates "strikingly"
illustrated tho importance of spe
cific appropriations, tho President
added, tiro transportation act having
"disturbed" tho ratipnship between
current receipts and expenditures to
tho extent of over a billion dollars.
"It is obvious," tho message con
tinued, "that these largo payments
have already seriously limited tho
government's program in retiring tho
floating debt."
Tho President renewed some of
the recommendations he mado at the
opening of tho last session and ad
ded: "I do not feel it my privilege at
present to suggest tho detailed and
particular methods by which these
objects may bo attained, but 1 have
faith that tho inquiries of your sev
eral committees will discover tho

way and tho method."
Tho only recommendations for
other than domestio matters was
that for a loan to Armenia to bo
administered through American
commissioners to. avoid "furHhor
tempting opportunities," to revolu
tionary tendencies in that country,
and for granting independence to tho
Philippines "to keep our promise to
the people of thoso islands."
Democracy, tho President said, is
being putupon its final test. "The
old worldA Baid ho, "is just now
suffering frorti a wanton rejection of
tho pooplo of uwnocraoy and a sub
stitution of the rinciple of nutoo
racy as assorted in tho name, but
without tho authority and sanction
of tho multitude. This is tho timo of
nil others when democracy should!
prove its purity and its spiritual
power to provail. It is surely the
manifest destiny ofi tho llnited
States to lead in tho attemp
make this spirit prevail."
Actiqn of tho House at tho late
session in deciding to refer all the
money bills i to an enlarged appro
priation committee showed signs of
developing into an open row. Repub-
licans were heard from sovoral quar
ters and committee chairmen partic
ularly wero reported as feeling that
the move had been in tho wrong di
rection. Inasmuch as most of tho legisla
tion which will finally get through
at tho present session is expeoted to
consist of appropriation measures,
cbmmittoo members who for many
sessions have aided in formulating
these "TRlIa were said to seo no op
portunity to assist in this work.
Chairman Butler, of tho Naval Af
fairs Committee, declared that tho
IIouso action means that "thirty-
m
five men, tho membership of tho en
larged committee, can now run tho
IIouso for this session and tho rest
of us can go homo."
"Tho change," said Representa
tive Butler," has simply mado uso
loss about 150 men who have work
ed hard on these committeos."
Tho Naval Affairs Committeo
chairman indicated thojt various
embers of the House wero prepar
ing, to voice their objection to the
plaiKand the whole question might
be brought up again for caucus ac
tion by tho Republicans.
Annvestigation by tho House mil
itary committeo to fix the responsi
bility for tho escape of Grover C.
Bergdoll draft evader, is proposed in
a resolution introduced by Repre
sentative Blanton, Domocrat, of
Texas.
The Volstead resolution to repeal
war-time legislation was favorably
reported by the House Judiciary
Committeo with an amendment ex
empting tho War Financo Corpor
ation act from repeal in addition to
tho Lever food control, Distriot of
Columbia rent and trading with tho
enemy acts and those measures au
thorizing tho issuance of Liborty and
Victory bonds, all of which wero
specially exempted in tho resolution
as introduced.
Mr. Volstead said ho expected tho
resolution would' bo considered in
tho Houso before tho end of tho next!
week.
