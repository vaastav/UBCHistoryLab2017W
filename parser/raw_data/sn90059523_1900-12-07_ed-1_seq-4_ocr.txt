j Beyond all comparison the most re
markable contention put forward by
those who oppose the payment of ship
subsidies is the one that, because Brit
ish maritime commerce, while not sub
sidized, flourishes, Americans should not
expend the national funds in promoting
their shipping: industry.
: We can very easily refuse to accept
either the premise or the conclusion in
volved in this proposition. They are
equally unreliable. England's foreign
commerce, the most immense, as it is
the most far reaching, the world^-haa
ever known, is, pure and simple, the
product of protection. We use the word
protection advisedly. It is the most of
fensive that can sound in Democratic
ears. Protection is today, and has been
since responsible legislation was first
formulated in England, the great policy
of the British empire in regard to'its
maritime interests.
I Now that England has won through
well-considered and liberal national poll
cy toward shippers, the virtual control
of the world's commerce, what more
natural than that she should disaffirm
any policy on the part of a commercial
rival which might head in the same di
rection? She finds quite a clever advocate
of this idea in the current number of the
j Forum.- It is Mr. Benjamin Taylor,
and lie lives, by the way, in Newcastle
on-the-Tyne. Mr. Taylor is a bright
man. He knows how to state a case
in half, to make the better seem the
worse and to keep out of sight all facts
r. hicta might injuriously affect his case.
j Mr. Taylor, very wisely for his cause,
[takes up the contributions of Mr. Eu
gene Chamberlain, the present commis
i
Bioner of navigation, to the literature of
.the subject and seeks to meet their con
tentions. How illy he succeeds is
made very plain by his entire article.
Let us see how at the outset he avoids
the main facts involved in the case at
issue. In the early paragraphs of "his
article he says:
I "The British government does grant what
are called mail subsidies to certain
steamship companies; and British ship
ping and ship building have thriven as
the shipping and ship building of no
other country have done. But there is
jio connection between the two facts,
ffhe ogress of British merchant ship
ping is in no sense or degree due to the
(payment of mail subsidies, which are
simply remuneration for cargoes car
ii. i. That cargo is postal matter, but
| the money paid for the carriage of it is
lust as much freight as the money paid
foy me: chants for the carriage of Man
chester cottons or American Hour. If the
iUnited states commissioner of navigation
j falls into the error of connecting Brit
ish maritime prosperity with mail sub
sidies, it is not surprising if the fallacy
is pretty current in the United States."
This sort of special pica of - confession
and avoidance will deceive nobody. It is
, bad enough as it stands, but when it is
•followed up by matter far less covert
■in its nature and effect, its true nature
as a plea is made plainer. _*or instance,
in discussing these same subsidies, tho
'amourt of which Mr. Taylor, literally
dare not, for the integrity of his argu
ment set forth, this advocate of foreign
shipping interests says of them:
'They are only attractive indirectly in
respect-to the prestige attaching to the
night to fly the Royal Mail Hag, and
many of these mail steamship owners
will confess to you, in the confidence of
private intercourse, that the game is not
.Worth the candle. They are in it, and
they continue in it, as is the custom of
all men of commerce, to run in grooves;
but they are by- no means the beneficent
ly endowed beings that Mr. E. S. Cham
berlain's argument may lead the gen
feral reader to believe."
Why does not Mr. Taylor tell us how
little they are endowed? He has every
variety of figures to give on different
phases of this subject, but not a single
■one to show how much her majesty's
government pays for carrying mall
►freight."
} But, mi-leading as his position is, he
?would not urge that England has never
put forward her national funds to aid
!her shipping. He would be -laughed at
for the contention. And no student of
this question who is anxious to see
American shipping develop to reasonable
proportions will delude himself for a
moment with the belief, after nearly
forty, years of experience, that there
.can be anything like a spontaneous
growth of American foreign shipping.
No; •-.either Mr. Taylor's arguments or
figures, nor those of any other of the ad
vocates of his school, touch the. vital
question of how best to promote the for
eign shipping of the United States.
COLONIAL aOVERXMEATS.
• From the treatment of the Philippine
Question in the president's message it is
•fevldent that he hopes, ultimately, to
govern those Islands not as colonies, but
as United States territory under the con
stitution as it now stands. Already are
,the Hawaiian Islands and Porto Rico
lUnited States territory, with practically
a territorial government. The Philip
pines, however, are a harder proposi
tion, owing not only -to a state of war,
tout to the various degrees of civilization
"existing among the inhabitants.
The plan of the president for the gov
ernment of the islands, while not ex
plicit, has the virtue of meeting the pres
ie'nt demands. The mingling of civil and
military authority Is always a delicate
problem, especial so when .any,: portion*
,of .the people to -be governed arc in arms
against the proposed authority. .-
Government of -the Philippines by the
Taft commission and the _military arm
of the United States is unique in the-his
tory of colonial ; governments. No one
will -contend that it is a constitutional
government, but there are -some things
which must be done without authority,
if the authority cannot be found in the
constitution.*-
The government: of the Philippines at
the present time is a war measure—their
government under the .constitution,
should the - war ' suddenly cease, is an
other proposition^^Considering the Ha
waiian islands and Porto \ Rico" as colo
nial dependencies, the United^ States is
still *an infant in colonial possessions.
Great Britain. stands first. as a colonizer,
then ; comes - France, followed by the
Netherlands and Belgium. Germany has
11,000,000 colonial '■ subjects— United
States about the same '
China, Russia and Turkey have de
pendencies over which a kind of su
zerainty is claimed,'but the colonial rela
tions as we understand them do not ex
ist. 7
At this time the nature of the govern
ments adopted for the colonial posses
sions of the leading civilized nations is
of absorbing interest. Great Britain gov
erns her vast colonial population (375,
--000,000) under one of three forms. First,
colonies having a responsible local gov
ernment, in which the crown has only
a veto on legislation,-and the home gov
ernment controls no' public officer ex
cept the governor; second, Colonies pos
sessing representative legislative institu
tions, with a reserved veto power in the
crown, but in which the home govern
ment retains control of ail public-, offi
cers; third, crown colonies hi which the
crown has entire control of legislation,
and the administration of public affairs
is carried on by the home-government.
Of the first class, Canada, the Austra
lian confederation,'• _ Cape ; Colony and
Newfoundland are . examples. _- The Ber
mudas, the Barbadoes and the Bahamas
represent the second class. The work
ing of the third classes seen in Gibral
tar, Hongkong and India. The govern
ment of India is under the control of the
secretary of state for India, the imme
diate authority being vested in a vice
roy appointed by 'the crown. The local
government is conducted largely by the
natives. French Algeria is governed by
a governor general appointed by the
home government, and is under the con
trol, of the-ministry. The. chamber of
deputies legislates for the colony, ln
Madagascar the same system prevails,
except the civil authorities act in con
junction with the military forces occu
pying the island. . The government of
French colonies differs from that of the
British in the fact that the colonies send
.a senator and two deputies to represent
them in the French assembly. These
representatives are usually selected by
a council. The government of the East
India Netherlands' resembles the sec
ond class- of "British colonial govern
ments. German.colonies are governed
directly by the crown.
The problem' of governing", the . hetero
geneous- millions of the Philippine group
to the satisfaction of, not all, but a ma
jority, and still keep within the constitu
tion, is a delicate proposition. Without
a constitutional amendment the only
feasible method is to erect, or cause to
be erected, territories out of those por
tions of the islands having a homogene
ous population, capable of understanding
the principles of civil government.
The president speaks of the Filipinos j
as the nation's wards. Just what legal j
meaning the word will grow to have re- !
mains to be seen. The greatest difficul
ty which will confront us in the assimi
lation of this East.lndian territory will
not arise in the problems of local gov
ernment of the natives, but in the In
dustrial complications that will develop,
in the United States when the country
is thrown open to the influx of the
Eastern • hordes. Possibly congress can
find a remedy under the "constitution—
the president recommends none.
THE CLATTtWf-BBLWR TREATY.
The Hay-Pauncefote treaty is a modi
fication of., the Clayton-Bulwer treaty,
made in ISSO. If the former is not rati
fied, it will be necessary to annul the
latter before ;we can undertake to con
struct the Nicaragua canal. The next
question is whether we can honorably
annul said treaty.
Towards the close of the eighteenth
century a British settlement was made
at Balize. Even before that time the
British authority had been extended over
the Mosquito territory, but -in ISI4 this
was abandoned according to the treaty
of Madrid. Later on, however, the Mos
quito territory was brought under the
protection of the English superintendency
of Balize.
An English settlement, Greytown, was
made at . the mouth ;of the San Juan
river, and the district thereabout was
forced from Nicaragua in 1818. England
was thus In actual possession of the
eastern terminus of the -proposed Nica
ragua canal. ".■77
Upon the discovery of gold in Cali
fornia it seemed very desirable for the
United States to have a canal connecting
the Atlantic with the Pacific, and the
United States began to question Eng
land's claim to the . territory which in
cluded one of the two possible routes
for such a canaL This agitation resulted
In the Clayton-Bulwer treaty, by which
both England and the United States
bound themselves "that neither the one
nor the other will ever obtain or main
tain for itself any exclusive control over
the said j ship canal," that .it should not
be fortified, and should be neutral at. all
times. .*
Some people claim that \ this treaty is
no longer.. binding. Senator Mason - says
that if two men had . enteredi into an
agreement fifty years ago to. build a
house in" partnership," and the house not
having been built-in the meantime, either
of the parties,, finding it to his best in
terests to build a house for himself alone,
has a perfect moral right to inform the:
other party "that"" he "does hot consider
himself bound "by the contract made
fifty years ago.*. T
The question is, however, wfiietber

;Scnator. Mason's - example- is , a .perfect'
parallel. 7- : ■
The English, on 'the other hand, main
tain that they gave up their claim to the
Mosquito territory only in considers
of our guaranteeing the* neutrality, of the
: canal, as stipulated by H the ; Clayton-Bul
wer treaty, and lf: we accept that version
" we: are certainly in all honor bound .to
abide by the treaty." We cannot jwell go
back of "that treaty, and maintain:'that
England .had no right to the Mosqu.'to
territory. '. The treaty itself looks very
much like an indirect recognition of Eng
land's .. claims, " and ' the undisputed fact
remains that England was at the time, in
actual possession of Greytown and the
surrounding country, and claimed au
thority over : the entire Mosquito territory,
by reason of her protectorate over the
Mosquito .Indians, who Inhabited that
country. .
o If we annul the.Clayton-Bulwar treaty,
it will be equal to declaring the claims,
which England had to Greytown and. the
Mosquito territory before 1850 null and
void. In 1850 such action on our' r^rt
would' have undoubtedly resulted in a
war with Great Britain/ Such, of course,
would not be likely to result now, on'
account of the way in which Great Brit
ain is otherwise engaged,- and? on ac
count of the general European situation,
but it would not fail to produce at least
considerable ill-feeling.
BE PRACTICAL.
In his annual, report, Prof. Robinson,
of the Central high school, makes some
very practical suggestions. <
This is a practical age and the Ameri
cans are the most practical, people of
the age. That is • certainly true in a
general sense, but we cannot apply it
to our high schools and colleges. Our
educational system is still modeled on a
plan that was fairly satisfactory fifty or
a hundred years ago, when commerce
and industry were still organized along
comparatively. simple lines, so that there
was but little demand for higher educa
tion outside of the limited number" of
those who were preparing for the learned
professions like law and medicine. -
Eut times have changed completely and
commerce and industry are now so high
ly and intricately organized that there
is an enormous and constantly growing
demand for-young men who are not only
well trained and. skilled, but actually
educated along certain lines outside of
the so-called learned professions. Very
little has been done in this country- to
supply this demand. On this question
Prof. Robinson says very appropriately:
In view of the fact that from 75 per
cent to. s*l per cent of ail high school
pupils are destined to enter business or
social, life without other preparation than
that furnished by the high schools, it is
certainly surprising that the courses of
study have hitherto - been shaped* almost
entirely by the needs of those prepar
ing for the professions. So extraordinary
a condition of affairs may indeed be ex
plained by reference to the rapid and un
expected growth of the schools in recent
years; but it admits of no defense.
"Already the matter has come to such
a pass that high school graduates, who
often know much that they will never
need and little that is of practical use,
find themselves at a positive discount by
reason of their preparation, while the
captains of industry are driven to fill
all places requiring special skill with men
of foreign training. Inquiry in almost
any large establishment will substantiate
the truth of this statement. It is discred
itable that such a condition has so long
existed; it is inconceivable that It should
long continue to exist. The time is al
ready at hand when the prosperity of.
the nation at large will depend upon its
ability to maintain and extend its for
eign trade in the face, of the fiercest
competition.
"What is true of the whole country,
is even more obviously true of St. Paul.
The prosperity of this city is absolutely
bound up with the expansion of her com
merce, domestic and foreign. The busi
ness men who have charge of this great
taking certainly - have a right to
expect from the schools all posible as
sistance.
"It is a notorious fact that the com
mercial conquests ... of - Germany and
France are largely due to -. their un
equaled system of education for busi
ness men. Is there any good reason why
they should have a monopoly of such
education? How could our high schools
give more effective aid than by supply
ing to our business establishments
young men, thoroughly trained in Eng
lish, history, commercial geography,
arithmetic and practical methods of ac
counting—provided, always they remem
ber how little any school training can
take the place of actual experience? It It
be objected that this has already been
tried, with doubtful success, the answer
is two-fold: First, that the men em
ployed as* teachers have usually known
little beyond the routine of bookkeeping;
second, that the fatal mistake has been
made of inventing a short and easy
'commercial course,' which has, in con
sequence, forfeited the respect of all
right-minded students... No course, what
ever its nature, can succeed unless it
be free from all suspicion of serving as
an easy road to a diploma.
- "Whereever thoroughly educated teach
ers have been employed, and the course
placed on the basis of sound scholarship
and rigid . requirements, business educa
tion has achieved a phenomenal success,
not only in Europe, but also in various
cities of the United States. In fact, the
movement in favor of the 'higher edu
cation of the business men' has already
reached remarkable proportions, .*. * *
and there is good reason to believe that
the regents of the University of Minne
sota, acting on the request of the State
Bankers' association, will soon estab
lish a school of commerce at the State
university., The time would certainly ap
pear to be opportune for St. Paul to join
this movement in favor of a more prac
tical education. The need -Is urgent,
local conditions are favorable, and the
additional expense would be practically
nothing; and if a branch -of the Com
mercial Museum is established here, as
anticipated, the facilities for thorough
work in this line will be unexcelled by
those of any city. In the United States."
The common sense of the country will
sustain the administration in its position
on the army bill. Until our foreign pos
sessions are adjusted and in : order, an
army of 100,000 is not too large for actual
needs. It is possible, also, that our new
departure in the role of a world-power,
with interests, and spheres of influence
to maintain, may render it necessary to
make a display of force, that peace may
be maintained. No matter how we got
into the-position where we now find our
selves—now we are - there—let: the full
dignity of the position" be maintained,
even if it takes an army of 200,000 men.
The latest opposition developed to the

In European countries cheese is largely
a substitute for high priced meat Which
the poor cannot I buy. The I Dairy Age
says that "in purchasing sirloin steak at
25 cents a pound we get one-third of a
pound of digestible nutrients for our
money; in whole milk at S cents j per
quart we .set 1 pound of digestible nutri
ents for 25 cents; in cheese at 15 cents
per pound we get 11-3 pounds of digest
ible nutrients' for 25 cents. Cheese gives
the eater more food for his .money than
does beef. As surely as the American
laborer lives so will he use more cheese
year after year."

says, is degenerate and must go. He
quotes cases ; where organs once indis

of progress, such as the hairy coat of our

The Washington Times predicts that

leaves that \ grow so opulently in the
bureau of engraving - and printing, will
be plentier in this capital during the
next session than" ever . before. Oppor
tunities for impecunious young members,
whose votes are desired, to. win large
sums at "hards', with nothing to go in on
but ' the traditional peppermint lozenge,
are to be too numerous to mention. Rep
resentatives i with conscientious scruples
about gambling. will be ■- accommodated
at any one of several stock tickers, and
ultra good, pure, and pious senators, who
are not to be had In either way, will be
presented . with handsome copies of the
Bible, between the leaves of .which they
will be apt to find most comforting and
useful paper bookmarks."

wonders. The Hold of opportunity is open

AT THE THEATERS.
METROPOLITAN.
The young person with brains, . red
hair, talkative eyes and no : conscience.
whose presence in Thackray'-s "Vanity
i*"air" compels one to forgive^, the fact
that all the other , characters are j pup-;
pets, was made a very live creation on
the stage of the Metropolitan Last even
ing by Miss Gertrude Coghlan's clever
art. Miss Coghlan's Becky Sharp may
not be a great creation. .rt is certainly
an interesting creation, in essaying the
part of an adventuress an actress inva
riably plays against the sympathy of liar
audience. This is not exactly one of
the things Miss Coghlan has to contend
with. 77 Becky Sharp does not fail:" to
amuse the "Vanity Fair" of today, -.s
she did not fail to amuse that mimic
"Vanity; Fair" in ; the novel.
There are few emotional scenes in the
play. ? Emotion wearies and ages, and
1 Becky was always wise. _ Nevins,'/ the
playwright, has managed to. make his
play interesting without the aid of any
notable climaxes; or exhibition of he
roics. * A3 the story is, so is the play, an
inimitable sketch of a wickedly- clever
-but always charming woman, whether at
the ball in Brussels, in all the bravery
-of satin : and jewels, ror .in the attic in
' Pumpernicle in j not very "clean rags. In
the synopsis is of the play the prologue
and the acts- are aptly, and in order,
named 1 anticipation, aspiration, tribula
tion, flirtation, temptation and . separa
tion.- In "separation" the audience Is
' given a glimpse of Becky," the governess,
at Miss Pinker ton's' academy. She makes
her dramatiq exit by/, hurling - a copy of
Dr. Samuel Johnson's sacred dictionary
at the principal's, head. That ...action
promises much, and Becky -nobly fulfils
.such promise.; o -: -'■"*„ '■'"'-" 7
In "Aspiration" there is the secret mar
riage to Rawdon Crawley, Sir Pitt's pro.
posal and Becky : 's chagrin /because \ her;
own haste has rendered . her,. powerless to
accept. "Tribulation" shows - Becky * and;
her 'husband living together, but very:
much in debt. The best scene in the play.
.is "Flirtation," where is shown a fash
ionable: ball room at Brussels, 5 on .the eve"
'. of the battle of Waterloo. ' Nowhere?else
is the; utter heartlessness7bf .' Becky's
character j so'! plainly revealed"as/In" her
treatment of Amelia; the ■ only > one who
had '/befriended-j her, and In her indiller-
c nee to .the departure . of v her /"husbands
who, - Whatever his faults, loved her -- The
fourth ;act;;; "Temptation,' *is the most
dramatic, for Rawdon Crawley returns
from- a debtor's -: prison -to rind the old
roue, Lord Steyne, making very . real
love to a tolerant Becky, and it is thin 1
that 7 Becky : permits herself the -in
dulgence of a little, a very little emotion.'

venturess In a garret, ; where some of . her
old ■; friends .-v come >to: see her. ; She

-BISPHAM-GORDON RECITAL.
- Songs of. love in 1 all its moods, songs
.of the sea, of the wood, of grim-visagell
war and of the many emotions . that
; play forcefully or 'lightly or soothingly
upon the heart chords "of mankind are
what a large number of music-loving peo
ple heard at the People's church -last
,night.77: ' ..;
7 That the song recital of Miss Katherine
Richards Gordon and Mr. David Bispham
was a success goes without saying. The
church |was filled, and, at the close of
the long evening's programme, every
soul went home . feeling that he or sho
had been.ennobled, lifted up, made for
getful of the troubles and -. woes .of
worldly life to live wholly in the : pres
ent, and untold things.
Such was the song recital.
Mr. Bispham needs no advertising; nor
Miss Gordon. His forceful whole-toned
baritone voice and her clear, smooth so
prano voice are advertising enough.
Time and time again the singers were
encored, and beautiful roses were given
to Miss Gordon by admiring friends.
The programme began with the "Song
of Repentance," Tannhauser, Mr. Bisp
ham the singer. In close succession
followed ' Chanson," from the old French,
arranged by Sauzay; "Let the Dreadful
Engines," Purcell," and "The Pretty
Creature," Storace.. The last named
seemed to be the favorite with the lis
teners. .: -•
Miss Gordon followed with Rett.
Strophes, "Lakme," Delibes, and "La
Chanson dcs Baisers Valse, ' Bamberg.
In the last named the refrain is:
"Kisses that are given,
Kisses that are forbid,
Kisses pardoned by heaven,
Kisses Cupid has hid."
Most charmingly did the singer acquit
'herself.
One song that aroused great feeling
during the evening was "How Deep the
Slumbers of the Floods," Loewe, and
sung by Mr. Bisphom. Music and words
so harmonized in feeling and sense, espe
cially with the fine interpretation, . that
it was impossible not to be deeply
stirred. '
If the song of "Edward," Loewe, by
the same singer, had not followed, the
audience would have gone home too
much impressed with the sorrow in life.
It is from an old Scottish ballad and,
though the words were hard to under
stand to those knowing little of , the dia
lect/there was a force and fervent feel«
ing in it that pleased all. . "
Miss Gordon, to many, seemed to be
at her best in the "Gypsy Songs,"
Brahms, or "Zigeunerlieder" in the
original. Lightly,. trippingly, airily went
the words, and the singer knew well
how to handle the modulation of her
voice. In the care-free and blithesome,
Miss Gordon is most at home, a fact
evident to even the most untutored. '—
One of the features of the evening was
the duo, "Amours Villageoises." After
its rendition the singers were obliged to
appear again and again and make their
bow. The songs in English, however,
seemed to be greater favorites.
"The Wedding Song," C. Loewe, from
the German of Goethe, was sung by Mr.
Bispham, and in it the imagination of
Goethe was strikingly shown.
GRAND.
"War on Women," the attraction at
the Grand the current week, has caught
on with local theater goers in a decided
manner. It is a drama of intense action,
thrilling scenes, and numerous laughable
situations, and the interest dees not lag
for a moment from the rise of the cur
tain to its final fall.
Miss 'Hope Booth, as Margaret Prescott,
finds r ro: c well suited to her dramatic
abih'i 'a! she is most ably assisted
by K-clv.-aru Trevor and Charles Clarens.

described his experience: "It was a lit
tle after two bells this morning,- and I
was smoking my pi pe in the 'Owl's' stern
galley The first thing I knew of any
happening was when I was thrown vio
lently from my seat. After the pitching
and jumping had stopped,.l crawled out
and  saw , that the steering-gear of the
Owl had been carried away, causing
her to part amidship. The after end listed
.badly to starboard and went aground
throwing all hand in a heap to the
listed side. No lives were lost, however
though all were badly shaken up and
somewhat damaged. One unhappy pas
senger bunted the. glass out of a port
hole cutting her head and face quite
badly. After wigwagging the craft com
ing up behind to change her course, the

passengers and crew and continued her
voyage. As for me,S I will be glad when I
am safe aboard the Albatross again.

"Making a photograph of James Harper
was the most startling experience of my
life," says George G. Rockwood, the New
York photographer. "In the year 1569 it
transpired that jno good picture existed
of the four Harper brothers, and it was
determined that they should sit to the
same photographer and have a uniform
series of pictures made. A very success
ful photograph 'of Fletcher brought them
all. James Harper was the second to sit
for me, and as he was passing out of the
door of my studio, he saw a portrait of
Rev. Dr. Muhlenburgh, - the founder of
St. Luke's hospital. We entered Into a
brief discussion of the mighty results pi
the well and wisely directed efforts of
one man as illustrated in the establish
ment of this beneficent institution. He
said: 'If anything should happen to me,
I believe I should like to be taken to St.
Luke's hospital, for there organized,
practiced skill would perhaps be para
mount to even the tender care and love
one gets at home.' His words were
prophetic. After declining his warm invi
tation for me to ride with him, he left
the gallery, I think, near 2 o'clock in
the afternoon. About 5 o'clock a gentle
man rushed into the reception room and
asked: -Was James Harper here today?'
'Yes.' 'Did he sit for a photograph?"
'Yes, and here is the negative—a superb
one.' .'Thank God! He was thrown from
'his carriage this afternoon, and now lies
dying in St. Luke's hospital.'"
