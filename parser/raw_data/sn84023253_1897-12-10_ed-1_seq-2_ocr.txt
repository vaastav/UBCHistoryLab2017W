Iu the Greater New York contest
the prohibition ' candMate polled
1257 votes. His contribution to the
campaign fund whs $5000 and he
thus paid about $4 for each vote he
received.
Speaker Reed on being asked what
was nettled in the line of currency
legislation, quoted the remaik of a
New York financier, "That the best
thing congress could do would be to
enact such a measure as would pro
duce sufficient revenue to meet the
expenditures of the government."
Banker Spaulcling of Chicago is
sentenced to the penitentiary for an
indeterminate number of years. He
became infatuated with his pretty
typewriter who, on a salary ol $10
a week, was one of the best dressed
women in Chicago. The bank's
money did it and the president of the
bank is now suffering the penalty.
Theophilus Grout, the past several
years editor and proprietor of the
Newport Express and Standard, has
sold his paper to D. W. Hildreth of
Barton Landing, who took posses
sion last week. Mr. Grout has
greatly improved the Express and
Standard sinceitcameinto his hands,
enlarging it and finally issuing it as
a semi weekly. Mr. Hildreth is well
equipped for the newspaper business.
Htfis an interesting writer and his
work under the sobriquet of "David
Hill" has given him quite a literary
reputation. We welcome the new
arrival into the newspaper business
of the state and very much regret to
lose Mr. Grout.
And now the? tell us that numer
ous Chinamen are evading the law
and getting across into this country
from Canada by disguising them
selves as women. The United States
seems to have a peculiar fascination
for the average Celestial, and he is
never so happy as when he can get
into this land of freedom, where
starched linen is so much in demand
and where his revenue is so much
ahead of what he can reap jn his own
country. It he has adopted the Jef
ferson Davis style of disguise in order
to cheat the authorities, he will have
to be closely watched; and as tidings
of this sort come from Newport, in
our own state, the newly installed
officials of the "District of Memphre-
magog" will have a chance to prove
their vigilance.
The nolle prossing of the five cases
against Dr. Giddings, a formersuper
intendent of the Vermont asylum at
Waterbury, will be perfectly satisfac
tory to the state at large. Attorney
Howland, in asking for this action
by the court stated in substance that
Dr. Giddings and family bad suffered
considerably from the stigma 'that
naturally attached to bis removal by
legislative authority, and that noth
ing could be gained by maintaining
the legal prosecution. The people
will agree to this. The untortunate
affair wh, at the time, credited
rather to the superintendent's lack of
practical experience in tne manage
ment ot insane persons, than to any
intention in the direction of cruelty;
and the best intettstsol allconcerned
will be quite as coir pletely conserved
by dropping the matter as by push
ing the prosecution farther.
nexation of Hawaii and these three
problems are important because upon
a careful discussion and a proper set
tlement of them much of the future
peace and welfare of this country
may depend.
The president aims at such revision
of the currency as "will make our
obligations less onerous to the gov
ernment and relieve our financial
laws from ambiguity and doubt."
The sort of currency reform that Mr.
McKinley is after is the reform that
will put our currency on the soundest
possible basis; and in this effort he
will receive a cordial backing. One
suggestion he makes is that all United
States notes that may be redeemed
in gold be set apart to be paid out
again only in exchange for gold. This
plan if adopted would interfere very
satisfactorily with the depletion of
the gold reserve. It is gratifying to
note that the president is substan
tially in accord with the policy of
Secretary Gage of the treasury de
partment, and that the two are pull
ing together for the attainment of
the same desirableend namely, such
a financial condition as will enhance
to the greatest possible degree the
credit of the nation.
Jingoeism is given a remotely back
seat when it comes to the Cuban
question, which is reviewed at con
siderable length. The president,
while not yielding one jot of his
Americanism and his sympathy with
people who are struggling for life,
liberty and happiness, still insists
that Spain shall have full chance 10
put in operation the more humane
policy which she has .promised to
use in her dealings with the Cubans.
And the whole country will endorse
this attitude of the chief magistrate.
He evidently believes that Spain hon
estly intends to bring about a change
of things in Cuba in fact, al-eady
there are indications on that island
that this is the case; and he very
wisely suggests that it will be time
enough by-and-by, if Spain shall
utterly fail to handle Cuba in the
right way, for the United States to
take a decided position and interfere
in behalf of the insurgents.
Mr. MeKinley urges the annexa
tion' of Hawaii, but does not give
any first-class reason why such a
thing should be brought about sim
ply indicating that it would be a
"natural result of the strengthening
ties that bind us to these islands."
He expects that congress will take
final and favorable action on this
matter at the present session. But,
when it is considered that the con
ditions of this union the political
relations thereof to the United
States, the character of the local ad
ministration, the equality and degree
of the elective franchise of the in
habitants, the extension of federal
laws to that territory or the enact
ment of special laws to fit the pecu
liar condition thereof, and the regu
lation of a labor system there, are
questions which congress will be
called on to discuss and decide before
this annexation scheme can be dis
posed of, it will be seen that the na
tional legislature has an extensive
job on band, with abundant oppor
tunity for getting into a tangle that
may prove fatal to the whole plan.
There are a great many people in
this country who are opposed to the
gathering in of this peculiar people as
citizens of the United States, because
they are not clear as to what is to be
gained by it ; and congress may well
move cautiously on this question.
The rest of the message deals with
reciprocity (in the direction of which
satisfactory progress is being made),
the sealing question, Alaskan terri
tory, our Indian relations, bimetal
lism, the Nicaragua canal and sundry
other matters of minor moment. It
has been well received throughout
the country, and even some English
papers are inclined to call it an ex
cellent state document.
free or all sla" ve. How like a dream
it all seems now, so far away. But
it was very real then, and for twelve
years our venerable senator was in
the thick of it, in his place in the
lower house at Washington. And
what a record of honor! His name
is associated with the tariff of, 1861
which changed duties from ad vo
lorem to specific. He had much of
the care of revenue measures through
the war, and in 18G4-65 was chair
man of the committee of ways and
means, a place of responsibility sec
ond only to that of the speaker.
Five times le-elected to the house, in
1867 his state sent him tothe senate,
and honored herself five other times
in bis return.
Senator of the United States! How
sonorous the title, and how impor
tant our senator's work! Thirty
years of it in the senate, twelve in
the house. Forty-two years in all,
the longest continuous service of any
man in the congress of the United
States. Think of the legislative
work that was done there in those
years, and the men who have come
and gone. And all this time Ver
mont heartily in sympathy with the
thought and work of the senator,
has kept him there. He links a past
age with the present. Most of his
colleagues of the- period of "storm
and stress" are gone, Lincoln, Sum
ner, Stevens, Wade, Wilson, Fesen
der, men of the west leagued with
strong men of the east to uphold the
law and to preserve the state. What
better work than this has been
wrought since the getting of a constitution?
I saw the venerable gentleman
only the other day. He .wears his
nearly completed eighty-eight years
with the grace and dignity we asso
ciate with a senator of Rome at a
time when a Roman senator was the
synonym of absolute probity. How
the fair fame ot our senator stands
out against the sometime murky at
mosphere of public affiirs. As chair
man of committees of finance and
public buildings and grounds, as a
member of various committees of
education, labor, census, revolution
ary claims, and on a select commit
tee on additional accommodations
for the library of congress, and as
trustee ol the Vermont University
and of the Agricultural college, our
senator has lived on in serene con
sciousness that except in equity and
justice the state shall not be builded ;
and with such building who cau
doubt the duration of the edifice?
If the ancients were right and
Louis XIV. and his advisers were
right, and the glory of a nation can
never be complete except in the erec
tiou of great and noble buildings,
then Senator Morrill must be al
lowed an ample portion ot the cred
that goes with the building of the
new hbrarv of congress. In sympa
thy with the undertaking from the
beginning, he and others saw the
slow passage of the bill authorizing
it through congress, and has lived
to see this object of his care and de
votion rise to completion on its site
opposite the southern wing of the
capitol, a noble complement to the
most imposing building in the world

President HcKinley's Message.
The message ol President McKin
ley to the liity filth congress will
commend itsell in the American
public as, on the whole, a cUan-cut
and sensible document. It is refresh
ingly free Irom jingeoism, and treats
of the different branches of our
national administration in a diri-ci
ana practical manner. 1 he most
important portions ol it are those
which refer to the currency question,
the situation in Cuba, aud the an
Vermont's Senior Senator.
This third day ot December is the
two and fortieth return of the day
when Senator Morrill, beloved in
Washington and revered in Vermont,
began his long and eventful legisla
tive career in congress. It was t
wild time for a new comer. Mr.
Douglas had got his Nebraska scheme
recognized, too much so indeed, a
double action mechanism, as he hoped
to hold the south, and win enough
votes north to make him president
How miserably his hopes perished
and how rapidly event9 crowded
.upon the heels of events all the world
knows. The Kansas matter, the
Sumner (outrage, the Douglas-Lin
coin debate, the J hn Brown affair
the elections of 1860, secession, war,
and Mr, Douglas' machinery was be
yond all human control on peaceful
lines. No alternative offered bu
that this nation should be either all
An Evident Need.
To any one who ha9 watched the
fire record iu St. Johnsbury lor some
time past and noted the extent of
the damage done, it has become very
evident that we need in this village
some method of dealing with small
fires that will not involve the flood
ing of a building and the ruining of
stock and household effects with
water when, in point of fact, little or
no water is necessary. Under the
present arrangement, the fire depart
ment has nothing else to do but get
a stream on as soon as possible; no
matter how large or small the blaze
may be, it is the business of the fire
men to put it out, and they direct
their energies to that end as they
should.
We submit, however, that there is
a more satisfactory way of handling
a small blaze, for instance and most
of the fires here for some time past
have been small affairs than bv
turning two or three streams on to
it and bringing about a deluge.
better way has been found by many
another village, and St. Johnsbury
can afford to adopt some things that
have been found effective in other
places. If our memory serves us cor
rectly, in the discussion over the ceu
tral fire station project some time
ago it was claimed that a chernica
fire engine could be used to great ad
vantage, ana some very interesting
statistics were brought to the Iron
regarding the employment of th
sort ot extinguisher. From St. A
bans and other localities came re
ports of a decided saving, both in
the expenses of the fire departmen
and in damages to occupant9 of
buildings in which fires broke out, by
the use of the chemicnl engineinstead
of the ordinary fire fighting appa
ratus. The opposition to the central fire
station plan succeeded in defeating
it, lor reasons best known to tbem
selves; and it might not be any
I easier to secure a voteMor that sort
of permanent improvement now than
it was then; but there is no good
reason, it seems to us, why a chemi
cal fire engine should not be pur
chased for use by our department
wherever the size of the blaze does
not warrant the free use of water.
Once employed, it would be found
that this sort of apparatus could be
dvantageously used very frequently,
nd that a great deal of damage that
must of necessity result from the use
f the hose would be avoiied to the
intense satisfaction of all concerned.
The matter ought to be given serious
consideration at the coming annual
meeting.

For the Equitable Life,
We settled a 20 yt ar Endowment, paying 4 per
cent compound interest for 20 years, lacking $9 35.
The party paid $47.68 annually. We paid him
$1467 25; 4 per cent amounts to $1476.60. He
had 20 years' indisputable insurance. Now he has
his money back, with a fair rate of interest. He
ought to allow 2 per cent for insurance and 1 per
cent for taxes, and if so it would make 7 per cent
compound interest. This is good enough.
