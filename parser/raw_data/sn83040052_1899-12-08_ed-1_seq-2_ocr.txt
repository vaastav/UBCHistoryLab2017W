To the Scnntc rind HouKe of Representatives:
At the threshold of your deliberation you are
lulled to mourn with your countrymen the death
if Vice President Hubert, who passed from life

V s I ecu removed from the hlnh office which he
honored and dignified, but his lofty character,
his ilcvntion to duty, bis honesty of purpose,
i.i.d noble virtues remain with us, as a priceless
lifii y and example.
A. to the Conntry'a Condition.

regular session with the country in a condition

Hit re than 11,0. o.UuO.ix 0 our Imports and exports

Exports of agricultural products were 1784,

In value 3i,59.l4(l, being larger than any pre

the fiscal year ended June 8), 1899, including
Ii 1.798,814. 14. port payment of the Central Pa

propriations the expenditures will aggroguto

Fur the llscalyear ended June 3', 189'.', the
internal revenue receipts were increased about

the treasury is shown by the fact that on De
cember I, 18119, the available cash balance was
IVW.OjI.rai.K. of which $.'30,7-14.9 5.118 was In

have brought gold into more general use aud

la:-g( r areas of land under cultivation, tho in
creasing volumo of agricultural products, cot
tun, corn and wheat, calls for a larger volume
of n:i ncy supply.
The National Hanking Act
1 In its earlier history the national hanking act
teemed to prove a reasonable avenuo through
which needful additions to the circulation could
from time to time be made. Changing condi
tions fcae apparently rendered It now inopera
tive to that end. Toe high margin In bond sc
cuit'es required, resulting from largo promt
v.u.s which government bonds command la tho
market, or the tax on note issues, or both oper
i.t::u' together, appear to bu the Influences
n-nieli impair Its public utility.
The intention of congress Is respectfully In

As to Trust, and roinblimtlons.
The industrial rorr.missk n. ere led by the
r.-t i f the congress ot Juno r.: i-,
eri-.iged in extended hearing upon tan d,s
ted quest ior.s Involved in the subject of com
Rial Ions in restraint of trade and ci mpct.tloa
Tliey have not vet comp eted their invo.itiga
tiou of this subject, and the conclusions and
recommendations at which they may arrive are
undetermined. Tne subject is ouo Living r.se
to many divergent views as to the aHuro und
viiTiety'or couse and extent of the injuries U
the publio which may lesult from largo combl
Lttiions concentrating raoie or ess uuuorous
laterprises and esiabllshmcuts, which prevl-
ously to the formation ot the combination were
curried on separately.
It is universally conceded that combinations
which engross or control the market of any
particular kind of merchandise or commodity
necessary to the general community, by sup
pressing natural and ordinary competition,
whereby prices aro unduly enhanced to the
general consumer, aro obnoxious not only to
the common law, but also to the publio welfare.
There must be a remedy for tho evils involved
la such organizations. If the present law can
bo extended more certainly to eontrol or check:
these monopolies or trusts, It should be done
without delay. Whatever power the congress
possesses over this most important subject
should be promptly ascertained and asserted.
An not to protect trade and commerce against
unlawful restraints and monopolies was passed
by congress on the !!d of July, U90. The pro
visions of this statute arc comprehensive and
stringent. It declares every contract or com
bination. In the form of a trust or other
wise, or conspiracy in tho restraint of trade or
commerce among the several states or with
foreign nations, to be unlawful. It denomi
nates as a criminal any person who makes any
such contract or engages in any such combina
tion or consplraey and provides a punishment
by fine or Imprisonment It invests the circuit
courts of the United States with jurisdiction to
prevent and restrain violations of the act and
makes It the duty of the several United States
district attorneys, undcj the direction of tho
tifwrney general, to ffittute proceedings in
equity to prevent and restrain such violations.
It further confers upon any person who shall
bo injured in his business or properly by any
person or corporation by reason of anything
forbidden or declared to be unlawful by the act
the power to suo therefor in any circuit
court of the United States wUuout respctto
tho amount In controversy, and to recovor three
fold the damages by him sustained and the
costs of the suit, Including reasonable attorney
fees. It will be perceived that the act Is aimed
at every kind of combination in the nature of
a trust or monopoly in restraint of interstate
or international commerce.
The prosecution by the United States of of
fenses under the act of I89J has been frequently
resorted to in the federal courts and notable ef
forts In the restraint of interstate commerce,
such as the Transmissourl Frelgr i association
and the Joint Trnfno association, have been
successfully opposed and suppressed.
Stata Lo;U!at!on Inadequate.
The state legislation to which President Cleve
land looked for relief from the evils of trusts
has failed to accomplish fully that object This
probably is due to a great extent to the fact
that different states take different views as to
the proper way to discriminate between evil
Injurious combinations and those associations
which are beneficial and necessary to the busi
ness prosperity of the country. The great di
versity oft treatment In different states aris
ing from this cause, and the intimate rela
tions of all parts of the oountry to each other
without regarding stnte lines In the conduct of
business, have made the enforcement of state
laws difficult
It is apparent that uniformity ot legislation
upon this subject in the several stales Is much
to be desired. It is to be hoped that such uni
formity founded in a wise and Just discrimi
nation between what is Injurious nnd what is
useful and necessary In business operations
may be obtained, und that means may be found
for the congress within the limitation) of its
constitutional power so to supplement an effect
ive code of state legislation as to make a com
plete system of laws throughout the United
States adequate to compel a general observance
of tlie salutary rules to which I have referred.
Jr;tvo the Nicaragua Canal.
The Nical iifc u.t final commission which had
been engaged upon tho work of examination
and survey for a ship canal route across Nica
ragua, h ivlng completed Its labors and made
its report, was dissolved on May .11, and on June
to a new commission, known os the isthmian
canal commission, was orgnnfzd under tho
terms of tho act approved March 8, 18n9, for the
purpose of examining the Amerlcnn Isthmus
with a view to determining the most practicable
and feasible route for a ship canal across that
Isthmus, with lis probable cost nnd other es
sential details. Good progress has been made,
but under the law a comprehensive and com
plete Investigation is called for, which will re
quire much labor und considerable time for Its
accomplishment. The work will be prosecuted
as errpedltiously as possible aud a report mnde
at the earliest practicable date. The great im
portance of this work cannot be too often or
too stronglv pressed upon the attention of the
emnrress. Jn my message or a year ago 1 ex

Our Interests in rhlnn.
In view of disturbances in the populous prov
inces of northern China, where lire many of
our citizens, and of the imminence of disorder
near Ihe capital nnd toward the seaboard, a
cuard of marines was landed from the Hoston
and stationed during last winter In the legation
compound nt I'ckiiu. With the restoration of
order this protection was withdrawn. The In
terests of our citizens in that vast empire have
not been nc;rlected during the past year. Ade
quate protection has been secured for our mis
sionaries und some injuries to their property
have been redressed.
American capital hassought an! found vari
ous opportunities of competing to carry ont the
internal improvements which the imperial gov
ernment is wisely encouraging, nni to develop
tho natural resources of the empire. Our trade
with China hr.s continued to grow, and our com
mercial rights under existing treaties have
been everywhere maintained during tho past
year, as they will be in the future. Tho ex
tension of the area open to international
foreign settlement nt Shanghai and the opening
of tho ports of Nanking, Tsing-Tao (Klao
( hae) and Ta-Llen-Wan to foreign trado and
settlement will doubtless afford American en
terprise additional facilities and new fields of
which It will not be slow to take advantage.

Exhibit at Paris Exposition.
Preparations for tlio Industries, arts, and
products of the United States nt the world "s ex
position to be held In Paris next year continue
on an elaborate and comprehensive scale, thanks
tr the generous appropriation provided by con
gress nnd to the friendly Interest tho French
government has shown in furthering a typical
n-hioit . nf American progress.
There has been allot ed to the United States
a considerable addition of space, which, while
placing our country in tho first rank among
exhibitors, does not suffice to meet the Increas
ingly urgent demands of our manufacturers.
Tho efforts of the commissioner general nre
ably directed toward a strictly representative
display of all that most characteristically marks
American achievement in tho inveutive urts
und most udequately shows the excellenoe of
our natural productions.
Plensiiiit Relation. With Germany.
Our relations with Germany continue to be
most cordial. The increasing intimacy of dlre.'t
association has been marked during the year
by the granting permission in April for tie land
In" on our shores of a cable from Borkum Em-.--
, t.hn North sea. by way of the Azores,
and also by the conclusion on September ot a
riircels cost convention with tho German em
pire. In all that promises closer rclutlons of
ii tercourse and commerce nnd a better under
standing between two races having so many
-in common. Germany can be assured of
the -noi.t cordial co-operation of this govern
ment und people. We may be rivals in many
oaths, but cur rivalry should bo generous nnd

Th Transvaal VFar.
This government has maintained an attitude
of neutrality in the unfortunate contest between
Great Hrltuln and the Hoer states of Africa.
Wo have remulnod faithful to the precept of
avoiding entangling alliances as to affairs not
of our direct conoorn. Had circumstances sug
gested that the parties to the quarrol would
have welcomed any kindly expression of the
hope of the American people that war might bo
averted, good offices would huve been gladly
tendered. The United States representative at
Pretoria was early instructed to see that all
neutral American Interests be respected by tho
combatants. This has been an easy task in
view of the positive declarations on both Brit
ish and Hoer authorities that the personal and
property rights of our citizens should be ob-
Upon the withdrawal of the British agent nt
Pretoria the United States consul was author
ized, upon the request of the British govern
ment and with the assent of the South African
and Orange Free State governments, to exer
cise the customary good offices of a neutral for
the care of British interests. In tho discharge
of this function I am happy to suy that abundant
opportunity has been afforded to show the Im
partiality of this government toward both the
combatant.
Wants a Cable to Manila.
The Japaneso government has shown a lively
Interest in the proposition of the Pacific Cable
company to add to Its projected cable lines to
Hawaii, Guam and the Philippines a branch
connection with the coast of Japan. It would
be a gratifying consummation were tho utility
of the contemplated suhome enhanced by bring
ing Japan aud the United Statos into direct
telegraphic relation. Without repeating the
observations of my special message of February
10. vm, concerning the nesessltr of a cable to
Manila, I respectfully Invite attention to It. I
recommend Hint In case the cmjross should not
take measures to bring about this result by the
dlroct action of the government, the postmaster
general be authorize. to Invite competitive bids
for the establishment of a cable; tho company
making the best responsible bid to be awarded
the contract; the successful compaay to give
ample bonds to Insure the completion of the
work within a reasonable time.
The Problem In Cuba.
The withdrawal of the authority of Spain
from the island of Cuba was effected by the first
of January, so that the full re-establishment of
peace found the relinquished territory held by
us in trust for the Inhabitants, maintaining, un
der the direction of the executive, such govern
ment and control therein as should conserve
public order, restore the productive conditions
of peace so long disturbed by the instability
and disorder which prevailed for the greater
part of the preceding three decades and build
up that tranquil development of the domestic
state whereby alone can be roalized the high
purpose, as proclaimed in tho joint resolution
adopted by the congress on the 19th of April,
189S, by which the United States disclaimed any
opposition or intention to exorcise sovereignty,
Jurisdiction or control pyej Cuba, except for the
pacification thereof, and asserted its determi
nation when that was accomplished to leave the
government and control of the Island to Its peo
ple. The pledge contained in this resolution is
of the highest honorable obligation and must be
saere:!ly kept.
I believe that substantial progress has been
made in this direction. All the administrative
measures adopted In Cuba huvo ulmed to fit It
for a regenerated existence by enforcing the
supremucv of law and Justice; by placing wher
ever practicable tho machinery of administra
tion in the hands of the inhabitants; by insti
tuting needed snultary reforms; by spreading
education; by fostering industry and trade; by
inculcating publio morality and. in short, by
taking every rational step to aid the Cuban peo
ple to attain to that plane of self-conscious re
spect und self-reliant unity which fits unen
lighteued community for self-government with
in Its own snhere, whllo enabling it to fulfill all
outward obligations.
This nation hus assumed before tho world a
grave responsibility for the future good gov
ernment of Cuba. We have accepted a trust
the fulilllment of which colls for tho sternest
Integrity of purpose and the exercise of the
highest' wisd.mi. Tho new Cuba yet to n"isc
from the nshes of the past must needs be bound
lo us by tics of singular intimacy and strength
if its' enduring welfare is to be assured.
Whether those ties shall be organic or conven
tional, the destinies of Cuba are in some right
ful form nnd manner Irrevocably linked Willi,
our own. but how or how far Is for the future lo'
determine in Ihe ripeness of events. V.'natever
tie the outcome, we must see to it that free Cuba
be a reality, not u name, a perfect entity, not a
hasty exper meiit bearing within Itself the ele
ments of 'allure. Our mission, to accomplish
which we took up the wages of battle, is not to
be fultllled by turning adrift any lnowly framed
commonwealth to faco the vicissitudes which
tooofien attend wenlter slutcs whose natural
wealth nnd abundant ro-ources arc-offset by the
Incongruities of their political organization and
the recurring occasions for Internal rivalries to
sap their st renc Hi and dlsslpato their energies.
The greatest blessing which can come to Cuba
is the restoration of her agricultural and indus
trial prosperity, which will give employment to
Idle men and re-establish tho pursuits of peuee.
Tnls is her chief und Immediuto neeil.
By t lie treaty of peace the Spanish poeple on
the Island have until April 11, 1!))0, to elect
whether they wlEremuIn ciilzcns of Spain or
become citizens ot Cuba. Until then, it cannot
be definitely ascertained who shall be cntilied
to participate in the formation ot the gov
ernment of Cuba.. By that time tho- results of
the census will have been tabulate, and we
shall proceed to provide for elections which
will commit tlie municipal governments of the
island to the officers elected by the people. The
experience thus acquired will prove-of great
vaiue in the formation of a representative con
vention of the people to draft a constitution
and establish a general system of independent
government for the island. In the meuntlme
and so long as we' exercise control' over tho
Island the products of Cuba shoulU have a
market In the United States on as good terms
and with as favorable rates of duty as aro given
to the West India islands under treaties of re
ciprocity which shall be made.
Concerning r Soldiers and Hnllors.
SInoo my lost annual message and' in obedi
ence to the acts of the congress of April 21 ond
M. 18118, the remaining volunteer force enlisted
for tho Spanish war, consisting of 31,881 regulars
nnd I I'J.rWJ volunteers, with over R,0 0- volunteer
officers, has been discharged from the military
service. Of tlio volunteers. 6:17 offlcer and 14,-
8111 men were serving in the Philippines and I.-
650 of tho regulars who were enuueu-io do mus

until their placecould be filled by new troops.

n.-ruliirs. sailors, and mnrlnoaon duly In Ihe
Philippines, who voluntarily remained in the
service after their terms of enlistment had ex
pired.
By the act of March ?, 1899,. concress has au
thority to increase tho regular army to a maxi
mum not exceeding 6i,ll0 1 enlisted men and t i
enlist a force of 8,iH)J volunteers, to be recruited
from the country nt large. My virluo of mis au
thority the regular army lias Dccn incroaseu vo
the number of 8I,9W enlisted men and 4,248 offl
cers and now volunteer reaiments huvo been or
ganized aggregating 8.),UJ0 enlisted men nnd
l,oi'4omcers. Twoor tnese Yuiumeer rcgimcnus
are made up of colored men, with colored lino
officers. The new troops to take the place of
those returning from the Philippines h ive been
trnnsportid to Manila to the number of 581 offi
cers aud -.MS! enlisted men of tho regular urmy
and 594 officers and IS.388 enlisted men of tho
new volunteer force, while bt4 officers nnd 14.
119 men of the volunteer foroe are on the ocean
en route to Manila. The force now In Manila
consists of m officers and 80,508 regulars and
694 officers and 1S.888 of the volunteers, making
an aggregate of 1.49J officers and 45 964 men.
When the troops now under orders shall reach
Manila, the force In tho arohlpelago will oom
prlse 2,i)5l officers and M8J men. The muster
out of the great volunteer army organized for
the Spanish war ond the orejtlon of a new army,
the transportation from Mani a to San Francis
m r f those entitled to discharge and the trans
portation of the new troops to take their place
have been a work of grent magnitude woll and
ably done, for which too much crodit cannot bo
thn war denartment
Tinrlnir the oast year we have reduced our
I toree In Cuba and Porto Rico. In Cuba we. now
have 834 offlcors and 10,608 mon; in Porto Rico,
87 officers and 2,8 enlisted men and a battalion
of 41)0 men. composed of native Porto Klcans;
while stationed throughout the United suites
are viu officers and 17,817 men and In Iluwall, 1 J
officers and 4-3 enlisted men.
Tho operations of the army are fully present
ed in the report of the soorctnry of war. I can
not withhold from officers and men tne nignest
commendation for their soldierly coniltut In
trying situations, their willing sacrifices for
their country and the Interest ond ability with
which they performed unusual and difficult du
ties in our island possessions.
In the organization of the voluntoer regiments
authorized by the act of March i. 1899. it was
found that no provision had been made for
chaplains. This omission was doubtless from
inadvertence. 1 recommended the early au
thorization for the appointment of one chap
lain .for each of said regiments. These regi
ments are In tho Philippines and it is Important
that Immediate action be taken.
Postal Affairs In th Colonlns.
In restoring peaceful conditions, orderly rule,
and clvio progress In Cuba. Porto Rico, und, ho
far as practicable, in the Philippines, thn re
habilitation of postal servloe hus bean an Im
portant part of the work. It became necessary
to provide mall facilities both for our forces of
occupation and for the native population. To
moet this requirement has Involved a sub
stantial reconstruction. The existing systems
were so fragmentary, defective und inudoquute
that a new nnd comprrhenslvo organization had
to be created, American trained officials have
been assigned to the directing and executive
possessions, while natives have been chiefly
employed in making up the body of the forc-e.
In working out this plun the merit rule has
been rigorously and faithfully applied.
Domestic Poital Service.
The domestic postal service continues to grow
with extraordinary rapidity. The expenditures
and the revenues will each exceed 111) yJW.DtK)
during tho current year. Fortunately, since the
revival of prosperous times the revenues have
grown much faster than the expenditures, and
thorc is every indication that a short period will
witness obliteration of the annual dellclt. In
this connection the report of th postmaster
general einbod es a stuXeuii.ut of sonic evils
which have grown up outside of the contempla
tion of law In the treatment of some classes of
mail maiter which wrongly exercises the privi
lege of pound rale, and shows thnt If this mat
ter had been properly classified nnd had paid
the rate which it should have paid, Instead of a
postal deficit the last fiscal year of W.6I 0O0
there would have been on one basis a surplus of
17,837,870. and on another of 8733,836. The re
form thus suggested, In the opinion of the
postmaster general, would not only put the
postal service at once on a self-sustaining
basl', but would permit great and valu
able improvements, and I commend the sub
ject to the consideration of congress.
The Question of Pensions.
On the 80th of Juno, 1899, the pension roll of
the United States numbered 911,519. These In
clude the pensioners of the army and navy In
all our war. The number added to the rolls
during the year was 40,991. The number dropped
by reason of death, remarriage, minors by lexal
limitations, failure to clulm within three years
and other causes was 43,186, and the number of
clnims disallowed wos 107,917. During the year
f9,0M pension certificates were Issued, of which
37,077 were for new or original pensions. The
niftount disbursed for army nnd navy pensions
duriuir tho vear was l38,8i5,nf2 9, which was
ll,8.il,451.6l less than the sum of the appropria
tions.

The All-AlnorhliMJ Phlllpplno Question.
Owthe loth of December, 18i)3, she treaty of:
peace between tho United States and Spain
was sinned. It presided, among ovuer iniiigs,
thai Spain should.cedo to the United States tho
arclitpe.ngo known, as tho Philippine islands;
that the United states snouia pay ou oimui iuc
sum of :o,0i)0.000i and that the nivil rights om1
political stutus ot the nutlve lnhabltan ts of the
frrltorlos they ceded to the United Suites
should be determined by the- oniress. Too
treaty was ratified by the senate on tne em oi
Febriiarr. 1899. ond by the government of Spain
on tho 19lh of Mnroh following Tho ratifica
tions were exchanged on the-1 1th of April und
the treaty publicly proclaimed. On tho 2d of
March the eongresss voted the sum contem
plated by tho treaty, and tho amount was paid
over to the Spanish government on the 1st of
MIn this manner the Philippines enme to the
United Stales. The islands were ceded by the
government of Spala, which had been In undis
puted possession of them for centuries. They
.,. ..niPil not merely by our author
ized commissioners In Paris under the
dii.setion of the executive, but by the constitu
tional and well considered action of the repre
sentatives of tho people of the United States in
both houses of congress. I had every reason to
believe, and I still believe, that this transfer of
sovereignty was in accordnnco with tho wishes
and the aspirations of the great mass of tho
Filipino paople. From the earliest moment no
opportunity was lost of assuring the people of
the Islands of our ardent desire for their wel
fare ond of the intention oi mis hotoiiuiuu.
commander of the military expedition dis
patched to the Philippines was instructed to
declare that we came not to make war upon the
people of tho country, "nor upon any part or
faction among them, hut to protect them in
their homes, In their employments and In tholr
personal and religious rights.
Thnt there should be no doubt as to tbs para
mount authority there, on the 17th of August,
it was directed that "there must be no Joint oc
cupation with the Insurgents:" that the United
States must preserve the peace and protect per
sons and property within th? territory occupied
by their military and naval forces; that the in
surgents and all others must recognize the
military occupation and authority of the
United States. As early as Deoember 4, before
the cession and tn anticipation of that event
the commander in Manila was urged to restore
peace and tranquillity and to undertake the
establishment of a beneficent government
which should afford the fullest security for life
and property.
On the 21st of December, after the treaty was
signed, the commander of the forces of occupa
tion was Instructed "to announce and proclaim
in the most publio manner that we come, not as
invaders and conquerors, but as friends to pro
tect the natives in their homes, in their employ
ments and in their personal and religious
rlvhts."
The same day, while ordering Gen. Otis to see
that the peace should be preserved in Hollo, he
was admonished that: "It Is most Important
ihnt there should be no conflict with the Insur
gents. On tho tlrst day of January, 18.9, your
general orders were reiterated that the kindly
Intentions of this government should be in
every possible wuy communicated to tho insur
gents." On the 21st of Junuary I announced my in
tentions of dispatching to Manila a commission
composed of three gentlemen ot the highest
character and distinction, thoroughly acquaint
ed with the orient, who, tn ussoclatlon with Ad
miral Dewey and MiJ. Gsn. Otis, were Instruct
ed lo "faollltitc thfi most humtne and effective
extcnsl p of au?h irity throughout thj ls'ands
and to secure, with t!io leu it possible delay, the
benefits of a wise nnd gentrous protection of
life and property to the Inhabitants."
" These gentlemen wero Dr. Jacob Gould Schur
mnn. president of Cornell University; Hon.
Charles Denby, for many years minister to
China, and Prof. Dean C. Worcester, of the Uni
versity of Michigan, wio hndmado a most care
ful study of llfo in the Philippines. While the
treaty of peace was under consideration tn the
senute these committees set out on their mis
sion of good will and liberation. Taelr char
acter was a sum. -lent guaranty of the beneficent
purpose with which they went, even if they had
not borne the po lit ive instructions ot this gov
ernment, which made their errand pre-eminently
one of peace and friendship.
But before their arrival at Manila the sinis
ter ambition of a few leaders of the Filipinos
had created a situation full of embarrassments
for us and most grievous in Its consequences to
themselves. The clear and impartial prelimi
nary report of the commissioners, which I trans
mit herewith, gives so lucid and comprehrnsive
a history of the present Insurrectionary move
ment that the story need not be repeated. It Is
enough to say that the olaim of the rebel leader
that he was promised independence by any of
ficer of the United States in return for his as
sistance has no foundation In fact and Is cate
gorically denied by the very witnesses who wen
colled to prove it. Tie most the Insurgent lead
er hoped for when he enmeback to Manila was
the liberation of the lslan is from the Spanish
control, which they fwd been laboring for years
without success to throw off.
The prompt accomplishment of this work by
Ihe American army aniJ navy gave him other
ideas and ambitions, and Insidious suggestions
from various quarters perverted tho purposes
and tnfntlons with which ho had tiken up
arms. No sooner had our u'Jmy captured Ma
i..1la than the Filipino forces began to assume
an attitude of suspicion and hostility which the
utmost efforts of our offl.iers und troops were
unable to disarm or modify. Their kindness
ond forbearance were taken as a proof of cow
ardice; Tlie aggressions ot the Filipinos con
tinually Increased until Anally, just before the
time set for the senate of the United Slates jTor
a vote upon the treaty, un attack, evidently
prepared- in advance, was made all along the
American lines, which resulted ia a terribly de
structlvcaud' sanguinary repulse of tho insur
gents. Ten day. later an order of the Insurgent gov
ernment was issued to Its adherents who had
remained in' Manila, of which Gen. Otis justly
observes that "for barbarous intent it is un
iualed In modern times." It directs thnt at
eight o'clock on the nlvht of tho lih of Febru
ary the territorial militia shall come-together
In the streets of San Pedro, armed with their
bolos, with puns nnd ammunition, where con
venient; that Filipino families only shall be re
spected: but thnt all other Individuals, of what
ever race they may be, shall be exterminated
.without any compassion, after the exiermtnn

a. ek later than wns originally contem
plated, Considiruble number of armed insur
gent entered the city by waterways anl

attempted to destroy Manila by tiro. They
werrkeptln check during the night nnd the
next day driven out of the city with heavy loss
Tliis was the unhappy condition of affairs
Whrn confronted our commissioners on their
nrr'nal In Manila. They had come with the
hope and intention of co-operating with Ad
miral Kewey nnd Maj. Gen. Otis in establishing
peace and order in the archipelago nnd the
largest measure of self-government compatible
with the true welfare of the people. What they
act cully found cun best be set forth In their own
words:
"i.leplornblo as war Is, the one in which wo
ore now engaged.waa unavoidable by us. We
wort attacked by a bold, adventurous und en-thiisln-tle
army. No alternative wa left to us,
except linoininous retreat
"It Is not to be conceived of that any Amerl
n wmild have sanctioned tho surrender of
Manila to the insurgents. Our obligations to
other uutlons und to tho friendly Filipinos und
on n.irselves and our tlag demanded that foroa
should be met by force. Whatever tho future
nf tho Philinolues may be. there i nooourss
open to us now except to prosecuto tlie war un
til the insurgents are redured to submission.
The commission is of tho opinion that thtra has

!Kh squadron by Ad-..-ilral Dewey v. hen It was

i-hp i.nurse- thus clearly indicated has boon
unflinchingly pursued. The rebellion must bo
put down. Civil government cannot be thor
oughly established until order Is restored. With
a devotion and galluntry wormy ot us moss
hriuiuni. hlstorv. the army, ably and loyally-as
sisted by the navy, has carried on this unwol
,...mn hut most righteous campaign, with richly
deserved suo-'ess. The noble self-sacriiic3 with
wlilch our soldiers nnd sailors whose sorvlce
i,..,i v,,iri refused to avail themselves of their
right to return home as long us tney wero need
ed at the front forms ono of the brightest pages
in nur umials. Although their operations huvo
been somewhat Interrupted and checked by a
rainy season of unusual violence unu uurauou,
t i,..r i.,.ve rained around stoadlly In every direc
tion, and now look forward confidently to a
.ui.ii. ..nmtitet.fon of their task.
"I V . . .,!
The unfavorable circumstances uunwcttv
with an active campaign have not been permit
ted to Interfere with tho equally Important work
of reconstruction. Aain, I invite your atten
tion to the report of tho commissioners ror iuo
interesting and encouraging details of the work
already accomplished in the establishment of
peace nnd order and tho Inauguration of self
governing munloipal life in many portions of
the archipelago.
1 communlcato these facts to the congress for
its information and action. Everything indi
cates that with tho speedy suppression of the
Tugulo rebellion, life In the archipelago will
soon assume Its ordinary o-.urse under the pro
tection ot our sovereignty and the neople ot
those favored Islands will enjoy a prosperity
and a freedom which thoy have never before
iinnu-n. Already hundreds of schools are
dom in sacredly assured nnd enjoyed. !n
courts are dispensing justice. Business Is be
ginning to circulate in its accustomed chuunols.
Manila, whose inhabitants were fleeing to the
oountry a few months a o, is now a populous
and thriving mart of commerce. The earnest
and unremitting endeavors of the commission
and the admiral and major general command
ing the department ot the PaclUo to assure tho
people of the ben-flcjnt intent ons of this gov
ernment, have bad their legltlmite effect in
convincing the great muss of them that peace
and safety and prosperity and stable govern
ment can only be found in a loyal ncoeptance of
the authority ot the United States.
The future government of the Philippines
rests with the congress of the United States.
Few graver responsibilities have ever been
confided to us. If we accept them in a spirit
worthy of our race and our traditions, a great
opportunity comes with them. The Islands He
under the shelter of our flag. They are ours by
every title of law and equity. They cannot
be abandoned. If we desert them we leave
them at once to anarchy and finally to barbar
ism. We fling them, a golden apple of discord,
among the rival powers, no ono of which could
permit another to seize them unquestioned.
Their rich plains and valleys would be the
the scene of endless strife and bloodshed. The
advent of Dewey's fleet in Manila bay lnstoad
of being, as we hope, the dawn of a new day ot
freedom and progress, will have been the begin
ning of an era of misery and violence worse
than any which has darkened their unhappy
past The suggestion has been made that ws
could renounoa our authority over the Islands
and give them independence, could retain a pro.
tectorate over them. This proposition will not
be found, I am sure, worthy of your serious at
tention. Sucn an arrangement would Involve
at the outet a cruel breach of fslth. It would
place tho peaceable and majority, who ask noth
ing better than to accept our authority, .at the
mercy of armed Insurgents. It would make us
responsible for the acts of the Insurgent leaders
and give us no power to control them. It would
charge us with the task ot protecting them
against each other, and defending them against
any foreign power with which they chose to
quarrel. In Short, It would tako trom the oon--eressof
the United States the power of declar
ing war nni vest that tremendous prerogative
In the Tagalo leader of the hour. JtVB
It does not seem desirable that I should rec
ommend at this time a speclflo and final form
of government for these Islands. When peace
shall be restored it will be the duty ot congress
to construct a plan of government which shall
establish and maintain freedom and order and
peace in the Philippines. The insurrection is
still existing and waen It terminates further In
formation will be required as to the actual con
dition of affairs before Inaugurating a perma
nent tchome of civil government The full re
port of the commission, now in preparation,
will contain information and suggestions which
will be of value to congress and which I will
transmit as soon as It is completed. j
As long as tho insurrection continues the mil
itary arm must necessarily be supreme. But
there Is no reason why steps should not be taken
from time to time to Inaugurate governments
essentially popular In their form as fast as ter
ritory is hold or controlled by our troops. To
this end I am considering the advisability ot
the return of the commission, or such of the
members thereof as can bo secured, to aid the
existing authorities and facilitate this work
throughout tho islands. I have believed that
reconstruction should not begin by the estab
lishment of one central civil government for all
the islands with its seat at Manila, but rather
that the work should be commenced by building
up frim the bottom, first establishing munici
pal governments and then provincial govern
ments, a central government at last to follow.
Until congress shall have made known ths
formal expres don of its will I shall use tho au
thority vested In me by the constitution and the
statutes to uphold the sovereignty of the United
States In those distant islands and in all other
places whero our flag rightfully floats.
I shall put at tho disposal of tho army ana
navy ull the means which the liberality of con
gress and tho people have provided to cause
this unprovoked and wasteful insurrection to
cease. If any or lots ot mlno were required to
insure the merciful conduct of military and
naval operations, they would not be lacking;
but every step of the pro.-ress of out troops has
been marked by a humanltv which has sur
prised even the misguided insurgents. The
truest kindness to them will bo a swift and ef
fective defeat of their present leader. The
hour of victory will be an hour of clemency and
reconstruction.
No effort will be made to build up the waste
places desolated by war nnd long years of mis
government. We shall not waft for the end of
tho strife to benln the beneficent work. Wo
shall continue, ns we havo bc:,un. to open the
schools and the churches, to set tho courts in
operation, to foster Industry and truitenn,d 'to
rlcultuie und In every waj In rovhlence has
malto these people ";t-Ji(,J00 fc?l lhBt It Is
brought wiuiin oMft'our powjr, their wolfara
i"V' jit bur gain that wo jro Keemng to
enhance. Our flag has never wavea, o.o-i j
community but In blessing. I believe the Fili
pinos will soon recognize the fact that It has
not lost Its gut ot ueucuitnuu ii w
journey to their shores.
Ut-commendatlons tor lorio mcu.
T-,vm of civil iurisnrudenoe now adopted
by the people of Porto Kico is desorlbed by
competent lawyers who are familiar with It as
thorou.hly modern anu sciculiuu. no .v .o
lutes to matters of Internal business, trada
production and social and private rights in gen-
enl. The cities of tne lsianu aro goveiucu un
der charters which probably require very little
or no change. So that wun relation wj iuu,a
of local ooncern and private right it Is not
probable that much If any legislation is desir
able; but with reference to publio administra
tion and the relations of the islands to the fed
eral government there are many matters which
are of pressing urgency.
It is desirable thnt the government of the is
lnnd under the law of belligerent right now
maintained through the exocutlve department
should be superseded by nn administration en
tirely civil in its nature. For present purpose
I reconimend thnt congress pass a law for the
organization of a temporary government, which
shall provide for the appointment by the presi
dent tubject to confirmation by the senate, of a
governor and such other officers as the general
administration oi tne isiunu may miu-n "-
that for legislative purposes on subjects of a lo-.
cal nature, not pu'taking of a federal character.
a loglslative council, composed partly ui rm
tn,.,..,. nnd nnrtlv of citizens of the United
States, shall be nominated nnd appointed by
the president, subject to connrmnuon uy mo
senate. In tho municipalities unu muci
sub-divisions I recommend that the prinoiple
of self-government be applied at once so as to,
enable the Intelligent citizens of the island to
participate In their own government, aim to
learn by practical experience the duties and re
quirements of a self-contained and a solf-gov-erning
people.
The fundamental requirement for these peo
ple, as for all people, Is education. Sys
tems of education In these new possessions
founded on common sense methods, adapted to
existing conditions and looking to the future
movement and industrial advancement of tho
people, will oommend to them in a peculiarly
effective manner the blessings of free govern-
me"t ., , . .
Glowing Tribute to Washington.
The 14th of December will be the one hundredth
anniversary of the death of Washington. For
lull years tho republic has had the priceless ad
vantage of the lofty standard of character and
conduct which he bequeathed to the American
people. It is nn inheritance which time. Instead
of wasting, continually increases nnd enriches,
w. mii iustlv hope that in the years to coma
the benignant influence of the father of his
oountry may be even more potent for good than
in the century which Is drawing to a close. I
have been glad to learn that In many parts of
the country thepeople will fittingly obsorva
this historic anniversary.
In Conclusion.
Presented to this congress are great oppors
tunitles. With them come great rosponsibilla
ties. Thepowor confided to us lncroasos the)
weight of our obligations to tho people, and w
must be profoundly sensitive of them as w
contemplate the new and grave problems which
confront us. Aiming only at the publio good,
we cannot err. A right interpretation ot the
people's will and of duty cannot fail to tnsuro
wise measures for the welfaro of tho islands
whifh Iowa coma under the authority c .
the United States and insure to the common
Interest and lasting honor ot our country.
