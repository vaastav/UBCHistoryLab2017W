There was a remarkable synchronism and
contemporaneousness, as it were, between the
publication of the President's message and the
revival of anarchism in Chicago.
If, four years ago, the civil-service rules
had been extended so as to include the postal
service, and the Cleveland administration had
respected the law, what an enormous flow of
profanity would have been prevented!
The St. Louis Post-Dispatch (Dem.) says:
"The President's message is either the perni
cious vaporing of a sorehead or the ringing
utterances of a courageous patriot." That is
exactly what we think, with the addition that
it is not the latter.
Mr. Bynum opposes the resolution intro
duced in the House, yesterday, by Mr.
Holman, providing for a congressional in
quiry into the recent election. Mr. Bynum
thinks no good can come of such an inquiry.
Perhaps not for Bynum.
"Whatever might befall the President or
Vice-president, actual or elect, the country
need never be without a Cabinet The news
papers can furnish an abundant supply. In
fact, they are turning them out so fast now
that the market is rather glutted.
It is remarked that six out of seven mem
bers cf Mr. Cleveland's Cabinet were defeated
by the people of their own States in the re
cent election, and those who were most confi
dent of carrying their States were the worst
defeated. The fact ia, Mr. Cleveland's Cabi
net will go out of office in worse shape than
himself, and that is saying a good deaL
From current utterances of the Demo
cratic press we infer that they regard about
one-half of the so-called Democratic voters
as purchasable. We have already known
that the Democracy embraced a very large
number of ignorant and venal voters, but
had not supposed the proportion was as great
as the Democratic papers imply. Something
should be done to strengthen their virtue.
The New York Herald prints the following
pen-picture of the Democratic party by its
Washington correspondent: "Discouraged, de
moralized, disorganized are not adequate
words to describe the condition of the Demo
cratic part of Congress. So far as the men
here assembled are concerned, there is no
longer any Democratic party." Of course they
feel aick and sore now, but as soon as an op
portunity for mischief offers the Democratic
party will revive. Satan is sometimes tem
porarily discouraged, but he never dies.
The virtuous Holman has just heard that
money has been improporly U3ed in electing
somebody to office. The phrasing of his res
olution, introduced yesterday, indicates that
the rumor of something of the kind "in re
cent years'' has just reached him. Mr. Hol
man is very innocent. In his own district he
may not have been under the necessity of
using money to secure his election, but he is
more ignorant than we take him to be if he
does not know that his party in this and other
States has for years past depended largely on
the corrupt use of money to carry elections.
This resolution, of course, was aimed at Re
publicans, but its flimsy false pretense wa3
exposed when Mr. Dingley offered an amend
ment, directing an inquiry "whether officials
of the U.uited States have made contributions
io such sampaign funds." This would have
brought .the President and members of
ais Cabinet directly within the scope
of the resolution. Holman objected to
Mie amendment, but was about to
accept it when Beriah Wilktns. of
Ohio, renewed the objection and the resolu
tion was referred without the amendment. A
thorough ssd impartial investigation of the
mbject :.. very much needed, and might lead
io good results. The corrupt use of money
in elections is an evil not to be winked at or
tolerated under any pretext whatever, and
good citizens of all parties should unite in
demanding that it be stopped, and those
who have been guilty of it be punished.
But no good can come of an ex parte investi
gation, conducted for the sole purpose of con
victing one party or one set of men and
ihielding another. Mr. Holman's resolution
was not intended to secure an honest investi
gation, and nobody will expect it from the ju
diciary ccmmittee of tha House, whose chair
man is a Democrat from Texas, and which
has several ex-confederate members besides.
We regret that some member did not offer
n amendment directing the committee to in
reatigate the disfranchising methods practiced
C tio Democracy in the South, and also the
infamous gerrymander in this State. There
are other election frauds quite as bad as the
corrupt use cf money.
GOVERNOR BULLOCK ON REC0B8TRUGTI0S.
The Atlanta Constitution, in a recent edi
torial, said:
"Everybody with a grain of common sense
knows that the solidity of the South hurts
and cripples this section politically; every
body knows that it prevents a full and fair
discussion of important issues. And yet, it is
better to be politically crippled it is better
to smother discussion than to renew the ex
perience of reconstruction times."
This statement is controverted by ex-Gov.
Bullock, one of the ablest men in Georgia, in
a letter which is full of patriotism and good
sense. 'Premising that material issues have
supplanted political theories, he replies to the
Constitution from that stand-point. At the
outset he says:
a "Thero has not been a national Republican
victory within twenty years which has been
so universally acquiesced in by our people as
the election of General Harrison. There has
not been a period within twenty years when
the broad, brave spirit of toleration for differ
ing opinions on public questions has been so
manifest as at the present time."
The Southern people deserve no credit for
acquiescing in the election of General Harri
son that is their duty but it is gratifying
to hear that that the spirit of toleration,. of
which there has been so little in the past, is
steadily growing. Toleration of differing
opinions means progress.
Governor Bullock flatly denies that the
maintenance of the color line is necessary to
the protection of the South, or that "the
experience of reconstruction times" was such
as to furnish an argument for the continuance
of white solidarity. It is common to refer to
"reconstruction times" as the very culmina
tion of human evils. It serves the purpose
of the Bourbon leaders of to-day so to refer
to it, because it was a part of the Republican
policy of the period, or natural sequence of
the war, and the only period in which negro
suffrage has prevailed in the South. Gov
ernor Bullock does not admit that the recon
struction period in Georgia was one of un
mixed evil. He says:
"I assert, and am prepared to maintain,
that whatever material disadvantages came to
any section of the South because of Kepub
lican reconstruction was primarily the fault
of our white people, who refused to accept
the citizenship and enfranchisement of the
negro, and sullenly neglected to make any
effort to modify the harsh terms and illogical
theories which were tendered to us as the de
feated party in the contest at arms in war.
With black and white delegates in the con
vention, a constitution was framed, in which
there is not a line of proscription or disfran
chisement; not a sign of rancor. As a funda
mental basis for State government, it is ad
mitted to-day to - be the best Georgia ever
had, and the equal of that of any State in
the Union.
"As to the personnel of the State'government
in Georgia which grew out of this condition,
there can be no adverse comparative criti
cism. The State's officials were not strangors;
they were not aliens; they were not black;
they were not ignorant; they were not pau
pers. The judiciary of that era has not been
excelled in the history of our State from
Oglethorpe to Gordon. Republican State leg
islation conserved the best interests of all the
people. Our courts were open to claims
against the State; justice was enforced; the
State's debts were paid; free schools were es
tablished; new railroads were encouraged and
built; new territory was opened, and new in
dustries flourished. The development of ma
terial resources, which is now accepted as
true statesmanship, was not then so well un
derstood by -the masses. But the record stands
to-day. It needs no defense."
Governor Bullock was Governor of Georgia
during four years of the reconstruction period,
and is as well qualified to speak of it as any
man living. His picture is not so dark as to
justify Bourbon leaders in citing "the ex
perience of reconstruction times" as evidence
of the utter failure of negro suffrage and in
justification of his disfranchisement. The
colored people have made considerable prog
ress in education and intelligence within
ten years. Perhaps a fair trial of negro suf
frage now would yield even better results
than those cited by Governor Bullock. He
admits that an ignorant ballot is always an
element of danger, but believes that
on the question of an educational qualification
the intelligent colored people of the South
would join with intelligent whites in favoring
it. This is a novel suggestion, and, if true,
is another evidence that the colored people
are willing to meet the whites on any common
ground of good citizenship and good govern
ment. Finally, Governor Bullock begs the
Constitution to "teach the people that the
negro is with us, as a citizen, to stay. That
the franchise cannot be regulated on a color
line. That there is no 'problem' about it, ex
cept our own ability as white men and citi
zens to lift ourselves above our prejudices of
'caste.' "
Governor Bullock's letter is evidence that
discussion in the South is not only not smoth
ered, but is fairly opened. The Constitution
is doing the South good service by opening
its columns to such discussion, even though
it still defends, editorially, the maintenance
of the solid South and the color line.
As an'offset to the large increase of Repub
lican strength by the admission of several
new Territories, Democratic statesmen are
discussing the feasibility of dividing Texas
into four or five States. The immense area
of the State gives color to the suggestion.
Texas has an area of 205,780 square miles.
This is seven times as large as Indiana.
Texas is three times as large as Great Britain
and Ireland, and one-third larger than France
or Germany. It would cut up into several
large States. It possesses great natural re
sources, and is increasing very rapidly in pop
ulation and wealth. The joint resolution of
Congress admitting Texas to the Union,
passed March 1, 1S15, contained a provision
looking to a future subdivision of the State.
It said: "States of convenient size, not ex
ceeding four in number, in addition to the
said State of Texas, and having sufficient
population, may hereafter, by the consent of
the said State, be formed out of the territory
thereof, which shall be entitled to admission
under the provisions of the federal Constitu
tion." This provision was embodied in the
ordinance passed by the Texas convention ac
cepting the terms of admission proposed by
Congress, so it is really a compact between tho
general government and the State. But by
its language the division of the State is de
pendent on its own consent and there is not
the slightest probability cf this being given.
From all accounts the people of Texas art
overwhelmingly opposed to a division of the
State. They are proud of its vast extent and
resources. Their Legislature, their new
State-house and benevolent institutions, their
railroad system and all their business inter
ests have been adjusted to the idea of one
State, and at present there does not seem the
slightest prospect of their consenting to a di
vision. Nothing but a complete revolution of
public sentiment on the subject could lead to
such consent, and that is not likely to occur.
Texas will doubtless remain for a long time
to come the largest State in the Union, and
may become, at no distant day, the most
populous.
A co-respondent of the New York Tribune
fends, from Constantinople, a translation of an
article on the political situation is this country
which is funny reading for Americans. It ap
peared as an editorial in "The Mizan," a peri
odical which, from its literary standing and its
generally able treatment of European affairs,
ranks very high in Turkey. The article opened
with an aceount of the war and ita successful
conclusion. The able editor then continues:
"The political parties at present existing in
the United States are the Republicans, who are
the successors of the Northern party in this
war. and the Democrats, who are the successors
of the Southern party. It should be noted,
howsver, that the Democrats have heartily ac
cepted the situation, and have entirely elven up
the Jdea of restoring slavery or of dissolving
the Union. In view of this fact, there was cer-1
tainly no need for the continuance of the party
spirit. But certain consequences of the war,
and especially the attaeks of the negroes, who
received political rights with their freedom,
upon their former masters, have pre
vented the calming of the popular mind.
The Southerners, deprived of a voice at
all proportioned to their numbers, were without
influence in the Congress. The presidency of
the Republic and other high offices were siren
exclusively to Northerners. For this reason the
Southerners, who had taken the name of Dem
ocrats, longed to have the Northerners forget
the past as they themselves have done. This
end they thought to accomplish if the control of
affairs could once pass into their hands. They
desired to get the control once into their bands
so as to do away with the suspicious feeling
which still regards them as in some measure
enemies of the country, by proving that they
would manage the affairs of the Nation as well
as the Republican, or perhaps better. - The
former President, Mr. Cleveland, gave to the
Democrats this control of affairs, and they have
truiy managed the concerns of the Nation in so
admirable a style as to draw to them the favor
cf both friends and enemies."
On the whole, that is about the best presenta
tion of the case, from a Democratic stand-point,
that we have seen. The unspeakable Turk
writes as if he had jnst returned from attend
ing a Democratic caucus. As long as the De
mocracy are receiving so much sympathy and
so many flattering notices from abroad, even to
the far Orient and the veritable sick man of
Europe, they need not feel totally bereft of
friends.
Trees and tree culture are beginning to be
recognized as their merits deserve. Twenty
One States and Territories now obsirve arbor
day, setting apart one day in the year on which
to plant trees. Thero is less need of this in In
diana, which waa originally heavily timbered
and has scarcely yet begun to feel the need of
tree culture, than there is in other States less
favored in this regard, or where timber destruc
tion has made further progress, but it is only a
question of time when the people of this State
will realize the necessity of preserving and re
plenishing their timber supply. Some of our
most Important industries are dependent on our
native woods, which are rapidly and wastefully
consumed without regard to the future.

These tables are prepared from the revised
figures as reported by telegraph on Friday
night. In every case the figures are official, and
allowance is to be made only for errors in trans
mission. The total vote is 11,340,018, and in
tho country at large Cleveland has a plurality
of 107,433. Harrison has a plurality of 466,830
in the twenty-two Northern States, - and Cleve
land has a plurality of 574,268 in the sixteen
Southern States.
Add to the twenty-two Northern States Dels-
ware and the four old border States, Maryland,
Missouri. Kentucky and West Virginia, and
Harrison has in the twenty-five States repre
sented in Congress in 18C5 and in Colorado and
Nebraska, admitted later, a vote of 4,066,293,
and Cleveland a vote of 4.264,223; Harrison's ma
jority in the old Union States, 402,070. Add
Tennessee, one of the first of the old Confeder
ate States to be represented in Congress in
1806, and v irginia, the oattlo-held of the Lastern
armies, and Harrison has in the twenty-nine
States, 4,055.545 votes, to 4,560.270 votes for
Cleveland: Harrison's majority in the twenty-
cine States, 2S9.267. The Democratio majori
ties in the nine States of Alabama, Arkansas,
Florida, Georgia, Mississippi, North Carolina,
South Carolina and Texas overcome Harrison's
majority in the other group of twenty-nine
States.
The Prohibitionists claimed that their candi
dates would be strong in the Southern States
and that many Democrats would vote the third
party ticket. A little more than one-seventh of
their vote came from the Southern States, the
Northern States furnishing 220,26o votes to 30,-
978 in the South.
The New York labor vote in the tables is com
bined. In the official figures the Socialists are
given 2,063 votes, the Union Labor 626 votes.
and the United Labor 2,663. But to estimate
the labor vote of the State the three are com
bined and all placed under the head of labor
vote.
AS AWAKKN1NG CONSCIENCE.
A Southern Newspaper Severely Denouncsa
a Recent Lynching: of Negroes.
Augusta Chronicle.
We have already published and commented
upon the dastardly outrages reported last week
near Danburg, in this btate. ln report states
that two negro men were drowned in the river.
and two others crnelly whipped. It Is not
charged that the men were euilty of crimes in-
vol vine moral turpitude, or of so cross a nature
as to call for summary punishment. It appears
that the difficulty arose by the instigation of
white men wno were in some way concerned In
ft dispute about farm products.
AY ith the government in the full control of
our own peonle and party, with the courts
open, with the officers of the law of oar own
appointment, and the juries of our own selec
tion, and with no chance whatever for the law
less or the guilty to escape punishment for their
crimes, a resort to summary vengeance, even
for the gravest offenses, is to be deplored and
condemned. Lynch law should never be re
sorted to where good government prevails. If
the maddened and cm el mob is to be substi
tuted for the jndge and jury, let our temples of
justice be closed and draped in mourning.
It pains us to write these words, and we shall
hasten to take them back if we have been mis
informed as to the facts. The barbarities in
Wilkes last week (the drowning of two negro
men and the severe whipping of two others) are
crimes against civilization and Christianity.
It was an act of barbarism that calls for the
prompt punishment of the lawless and
inhuman men concerned. This is such
a heinous crime against the lives, rizhta
and liberties of the people as to call
for prompt action on the part of Govercor
Gordon. Lynch law should be stamped ont iu
Georgia, lhe lyncners snould be made to
suffer the fell punishment of the law for their
inhuman conduct and ontra?eous crimes, which
language fails us to adequately denounce and
condemn.
THIRD PAKTIES.
People'TTho Act with Them Virtually Iis-
franclilse Themselves.
St. Louis CJobe-Deniocrat.
The returns of this year's election show very
plainly that there is no room for a third party
in our politics. In a total vote of nearly 11.000,
000, only 385,950 citizens supported other candi
dates than those presented by the two great
parties which have antaconized each other for
the last thirty-two years. Neither of the two
smaller parties carried a single State, or elected
a aingle member of Concress. The votes polled
for their tickets represent just so much
political strength thrown away. At the
rate of increase in their votes
it would take them a lifetime to
achieve success, even if they could
hope, as they cannot, to maintain tneraselves
for an indefinite period under saeh discouraging
conditions. It is true that in certain localities
thsy have had some effect by giving their assist
ance to candidates of one or the other of the
large parties, but that has not profited them
anythine as separate organizations. They are
not in a position to demand the passage of any
law, or to claim any of the advantages of vic
tory. For ail practical purposes tbey might as
well rot have an existence. The number of
voters belonging to the Republican and Demo
cratic parties respectively is so much larger than
the number of those who tram under other ban
ners that the latter are virtually disfranchised
by their own acL
The simple truth is that the American people
thinic two parties sufficient in all emergencies.
It is possible for the intelUgent and patriotic
citizen to find in the creed of one or the other
an adequate expression of his views ou all im
portant issues. No one party cau undertake to
cover every question of interest at any given
time, but it can readily deal with enough of such
questions to satisfy a reasonable demand, and
that is what the two leading parties of the pres
ent day have always done. The man who votei;
outside of them, therefore, merely permits him
self to exaggerate the valne cf some special
opinion that he may entertain, and to lose bis
vote instead of using it in a positive and practical
manner. It is safe to predict that neither the
Republican nor the Democratio partr is likely
to die for many years to come. One or the
other of them will continue to rule the country
in the future as tney have done in the past.
Third parties may appear from time to time,
based upon superficial and temporary considera
tions, but the great majority of the votesthe
votes that count iu deciding elections cannot
be drawn away from the two well-c-jtablished
parties which cow represent all but 385.900 of
the nearly 11,000.000 voters of the United
States. Those citizens who choose to act with
one of the smaller organizations msy be con
scientious and independent, but tbey are cer
tainly not wise thus to disfranchise themselves
when tbey have the opportunity to make their
votes serviceable by giving them to a party
which has the means to accomplish substantial
remits.
MRS. rOLSOM TO WED.
Bestowing? Her Hand Upon United States
Consul Merrltt, at Chemnitz.
New York Special.
This mornings Snn has an article dated Paris,
Nov. 30, in regard to the approaching marriage
of Mrs. Folsom and Coosnl Merritt, and the iat
ter's hope of succeeding Minister Pendleton. It
says:
"Relatives and friends who have known these
many months that something besides the desire
to master the French lanraara took Mrs. Fol
som abroad, have been astonished that the fact
has not been published in America that Mrs.
Folsom will, in all probability, marry Consul
Merritt. The rumors and denials were interest
ing to a certain handsome American in Saxony,
who represents his country at the charming lit
tle city of Chemnitz, and who was, and is. per
haps, better informed as to Mrs. Folsom's inten
tions than were many news-gatherers who have)
been so busy with the story.
The question of diplomacy and we now know
that Mrs. Folsom has aot only an interest in
diplomacy, bnt in diplomates. or at least one
diplomate was how the agreeable consul at
the little Saxon town of Chemnitz could be pro
moted to Berlin, cither as minister or Consul
general, without raising a sensation or creatine
too much newspaper comment, when it should
be known that Mrs. Folsom, as the wife of Mr.
Henry F. Merritt, cow consul at Chemnitz,
would be benefitted by the change. Now that
Mr. Cleveland's political life is over the office of
Minister to Berlin would be of little service to
Mrs. Folsom's prospective husband. When it
was thought that Mr. Cleveland would snceeed
himself the plan was to giro Mr. Merritt Sena
tor Pendleton's Position. At present it is ar
ranged that Mr. Merritt shall be consul-general
to Berlin before the 4th of March, and if the
President's indomitable pride can be overcome
enough to ask a favor of his enemies it will be
an easy matter to arrange that Mr. Merritt
shall remain under the Republican administra
tion, and, with the mother-in-law of an ex-President
as head of the consulate in Berlin, its so
cial position would be altered, for the same
charm ot manner which in Mrs. Cleveland has
unlocked all hearts and disarmed all criticism
is a direct inheritance from her mother, and
would open the iron doors of custom, even
though the keys be held by conservative Ger
mans. Among the few who were admitted to Mrs.
Folsom's circle during her last stay in Paris she
was as popular as she had always been in Wash
ington, where not handicapped by an official po
sition, 6he has been able to choose her own
friends; but among all cliques and coteries she
has been loved for her warm, sympathetic pres
ence and gracious manner. Whoever is familiar
with the lovely features and sweet expression of
Mrs. Cleveland's mother is not astonished at the
beauty of the firtt lady of the land, for mother
and daughter are equally charming and enough
alike to be two sisters. It is hard, indeed, to
realize the relationship, Mrs. Folsom appears so
young.
Mrs. Folsom's fiance is a large man, of fine
presence, somewhat past fifty, whose genial dis
position has made him a great favorite with
those traveling Americans, who, after visitinc
the Erzgebirge, atop to rest at the quaint old
town of Chemnitz, which lies on the plain at
their feet,and where one or two fine old churches,
the Castle (which waa at one time a Benedictine
abbey), and some pictures by Crauscn, the
elder, givo them an excuse for sereral days
eight-seeing.
There is some doubt about the date of the
marriage, after which Mr. and Mrs. Merritt will
make a tour of the United States and Canada,
and will then sail on the Noordland, of the Red
Star Line, for Germany.
WOO PROFESSOR FISKE IS.
The Man Who Will Get the Vast Fortune
That Cornell University Lost.
Philadelphia Record's "Waptiington I etter.
Prof. Willard Fiske, formerly libarian cL
Cornell University, in whose favor the kig col
test over his wife's will has just been deeided,
is now living with his aged mother in Italy.
Last summer a friend of mine found him in the
palace just outside of Florence, which the late
George P. March occupied part of the time while
minister to Italy. Old Mrs. Fiske was the
village milliner when the Professor was a small
boy. His father had died while he wis still
young, aod his mother had all she could do to
support herself, much less to odueate her son.
But, like many another American mother, with
the heroism which Is only ''patience for one
moment more," she did both until she
had got her boy into Hamilton College.
There he was able, being bright
and industrious and simple in his needs, to put
himself through the course. Bsyard Taylor,
who was hia college mate, suggested that he go
aboad and make a special study of some lan
guage and literature. Fiske thereupon went to
Upsol, in Sweden, where be mastered Scandina
vian and ita learning. Returning, he became an
asiistant librarian in the Astor library, remain
ing there, I think, until he went to Cornell Uni
Tersity. Mr. Fiske became a good deal of a Bohemian
of the literary sort, lie was empatically a man's
man, c&riog nothing for women apparently. No
one thought of his marrying Miss Jennie
McGraw, the rich heiress of Ithaca, except
President Andrew D. White, who, as the friend
of both, and of Cornell University, brought
Professor Fiske and Miss McGraw together in
Berlin while he was our minister there, and
married them from the American Legation.
Mrs. Fiske died in a year, leaving her husband,
who had probably never before had $300 in hand
atone time, $300,000, and ihejbalance of ber fort
une, about $1,500,000, to Cornell University.
Up to thia time Professor Fiske bad seemed as
indifferent to money as to women.
He might have remained content with his
$300,000 lecacy, I am told, to this day if it had
sot been for personal friction between him and
some or tho trustees of Cornell, who had not
treated him very kindly. But their conduct eo
irritated his feelings that- he determined to pre
vent Cornell from getting his wife bequest.
The sharp eye of Gov. David 1$. Hill, then prac
ticing law in Elmira, discovered the clause in
Cornell's charter which forbids the University's
holdiog more than $3,000,000 as endowment.
This limit had been reached when Mrs. Fiske
made ber bequest, and so. Gov. Hill argned, the
whole estate must go to Prof. Fiske. The courts
have agreed with him, and so Prof. Fiske be
comes a millionaire. I am told by Cornell men
that the trustees who offended him will be held
responsible bv most of the alumni for the coarse
which Prof. Fiske has pursued ao successfully,
and which has cost Cornell cot only his wife's
legacy, but that which he would probably have
left in his own will.
Jefferson Davis a Home.
Correspondence of the Louisrille Courier-Journal.
Beauvoir, with its cool verandas, its wide
'awns and its virgin groves, its wharf, its boats
id its bath-house, is a typicai Gulf coatt borne,
1 in the occasional absecee of the curious and
,ht-sceiog it looks the very abode of peace and
. st, by the placid sound that nsrer whispers of
rocks and breakers where a nation stranded.
The stranger here enjoys the tree hospitality
which to the born Southron is scarcely dis
tinctive, although many of its recipients are but
so many mysteries to those who cannot conceive
of Mr. and Mrs, Jefferson Davis as show people,
but prize them for his simple greatness and her
simple goodness; while the "Child of the Con
federacy is in the truest sense the peculiar
possession of southern Mississippi. Beauvoir is
but one cf many in a lone line of handsome
villas that, with a few happy exceptions, blend
walls that are variously white with blinds that
are variously gren, whereas a more sombre or
neutral combination would not only be an offset
to the general glare, but a resistant to the
forces that so swiftly and surely conrert new
white and green into dioginess and weather
stain.
