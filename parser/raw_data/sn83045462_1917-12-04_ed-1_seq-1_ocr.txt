Pacifists, Scouts Malice.
Immediate declaration of war
against Austria - Hungary was
recommended to Congress today
by President Wilson in his annual
message to Congress.
His same logic would lead also
to a declaration of war against
Turkey and Bulgaria, but they are
the mere tools of Germany and do
not yet stand in a direct path of
our necessary action, he said.
The President's address was
considered of such great impor
tance in the development of the
war that it was sent in advance
to nearly all of the principal capi
tals of the civilized world.
The President said our present
and immediate path is to win the
war, and nothing shall turn him
aside from it until it is accom
plished.
Peace, the President declared,
could come only when the Ger
man people make it through rulers
the world can trust; when they
make reparation for the destruc
tion their present rulers have
wrought, and when Germany re
cedes from all the territory ac
quired by anped conquest.
A' wild demonstration, which
lasted about thirty seconds,
greeted the President's recom
mendation that Austria-Hungary
be declared in a state of war. Sen
ators and representatives arose in
their seats and applauded vigor
ously, while visiting members of
the diplomatic corps smiled as
they applauded.
Pmident Wans Pacifists.
Those who desire to bring about
peace before that purpose is achieved
should carry their advice elsewhere,
he warned.
*111 not entertain It," he said.
We shall regard the war as won only
when the German people say to us
through properly accredited represent
J l.h<Ly to agree to
a settlement based upon Justice and
the reparation of the wrongs their
rulers have done."
No Malice Toward Huns.
He said he did not wish in any way to
"?air or to rearrange the Austro-Hun
farian empire. He hoped to secure tor
the peoples of the Balkan peninsula and
for the people of the Turkish empire the
right and Opportunity to make their
own lives safe, their own fortunes secure
against oppression or injustices and from
the dictation of foreign courts or parties
He said no wrong is Intended against
th? German empire, no interference
With their internal affairs. "We should
deem either the one or the other abso
lutely unjustifiable, absolutely con
trary to the principles we have pro
fessed to live by. and to hold most
sacred throughout our life as a na
tion."
Germany's declaration that she Is
fighting a war of self-defense against
deliberate agression, the President In
ringing words, declared "wantonly
false," and he reiterated anew that no
one is threatening the existence of the
Independence of the peaoful enterprise
of Germany. Of those who speak of
peace without the overthrow of Ger
man military autooraey, the President
declared:

in which we may attain it with uplift

PRESIDENTS ADDRESS
DEALS WITH TOPICS OF
| INTERNATIONAL CONCERN
The President's message, in full, fol
lows:
December 4, 1917.
Gentlemen of the Congress: Eight
months have elapsed since I last had
the honor of addressing you. They
have been months crowded with events
of immense and grave significance for
us. I shall not undertake to retail or
even to summarize those events. The
practical particulars of the part we
have played in them will be laid be
fore you in the reports of the executive
departments. 1 shall discuss only our
present outlook upon these vast affairs,
our present duties, and the immediate
means of accomplishing the objects we
shall hold always In view.
I shall not go back to debate the
causes of the war. The Intolerable
wrongs done and planned against us by
the sinister masters of Germany have
lonfc since become too grossly obvious
and odious to every true American to
need to be rehearsed. But I shall ask
you to consider again and with a very
grave scrutiny our objectives and the
measures by which we mean to attain
them: for the purpose of discussion
here In this place is action, and our ac
tion must move straight toward defi
nite ends. Our object is, of course, to
win the war; and we shall not slacken
or suffer ourselves to be diverted until
it is won. But It is worth while asking
and answering the question. When shall
we consider the war won?
Know What War Is About.
From one point of view it Is not
necessary to broach this funda
mental matter. I do not doubt that
the American people know what the
war is about and what sort of an
outcome they, will regard as a
realization of their purpose in it.
As a nation we are united In spirit
and intention. I pay little heed to
those who tell me otherwise. I hear
the voices of dissent,?who does
not? I hear the criticism and the
clamor of the noisily thoughtless
and troublesome. I also see men
here and there fling themselves In
impotent dislbyalty against the
calm. Indomitable power of the na
tion. I hear men debate peace who
understand neither its nature nor
the way In which we may attain it
with uplifted eyes and unbroken
spirits. But I know that none of
these speaks for the nation. They
do not touc^ the heart of any
thing. They may safely be left to
strut their uneasy hour and be for
gotten.
But from another point of view I ?
believe that it la necessary to say
Plainly what we here at the seat of
action consider the war to be for
and what part we mean to play in
the settlement of Its searching is
sues. We are the spokesmen of the
American people, and they have a
right to know whether their purpose
is ours. They desire peace by the
overcoming of evil, by- the defeat
once for all of the sinister forces
that interrupt peace and render It
impossible, and they wish to know
how closely our thought runs with
theirs and what action we propose.
They are impatient with those who
desire peace by any sort of compro
mise?deeply and indignantly impa
tient?but they will be equally im
patient with us if w.e do not make it
plain to them what our objectives
are and what we are planning for in
seeking to make conquest of peace
by arms.
Speaks for Americans.
I believe that I speak for them
when I say two things: First, that
this intolerable Thing of which the
masters of Germany have shown us
the ugly face, this menace of com
bined intrigue and force which we
now see so clearly as the German
power, a Thing without conscience
or honor or capacity for covenanted
peace, must be crushed, and, if it be
not utterly brought to an end, at
least shut out from the friendly in
tercourse of the nations: and. second,
that when this Thing and its power
are indeed defeated and the time
comes that we can discuss peace?
when the German people have
spokesmen whose word we can be
lieve and when those spokesmen are
ready in the name of their people to
accept the common judgment of the
nations as to what shall henceforth
be the bases of law and of covenant
for the life of the world?we shall
be willing and glad to pay the full
price for peace, and pay it un
grudgingly. We know what that
price will be. It will be full. Im
partial justice?justice done at every
point and to every nation that the
final settlement: must affect, our
enemies as well as our friends.
Vou catch, with me, the voices of
humanity that are in the air. They
grow dally more audible, more ar
ticulate. more persuasive, and they
come from the hearts of men every
where. They insist that the war
shall not end in vindictive action of
any kind; that no nation or people
shall be robbed or punished be
cause the Irresponsible rulers of a
single country have themselves done
deep and abominable wrong. It is
this thought that has been express
ed in the formula "No annexations
no contributions, no punitive indem
nities." Just because this crude for
mula expresses the Instinctive judg
ment as to right of plain men every
where it has been made diligent use
of by the masters of German in
trigue to lead the people of Russia
astray ? and the people of every
other country their agents could
reach, in order that a premature
peace might be brought about before
autocracy has been taught its final.
and convincing lesson, and the peo
ple of the world put in control of
| their own destinies.
Patronage of Seal Friends.
But the fact that a wrong use
has been made of a just idea Is no
reason why a right use should not
be made of it. It ought to be
brought under the patronage of Its
real friends. Let It be said again
that autocracy must first be shown
the utter futility of its claim to
power or leadership In the modern
j^prld. It Is Impossible to apply
any standard of Justice so long as
such forces are unchecked and un
defeated as the present masters of
Germany command. Not until that
has been done can right be set up
as arbiter and peace-maker among
the nations. But when that haa
been done?as, God willing, It as
suredly will be?we shall at last be
free to do an unprecedented thing,
and this la the time to avow onr
purpose to do it. We shall be free
to base peace on generosity and
justice, to the exclusion of all selfish
cli'lms to advantage even on the
part of the victors.
Ubt Ultra be no misunderstanding.
Our present and immediate task Is to
, win the war, and nothing shall turn
| us aside from it until it is accom
plished. Every power and resource
we possess, whether of men, of
money, or of materials, is being de
voted and will continue to be devoted
to that purpose until it is achieved.
Those who desire to bring peace about
before that purpose is achieved I
counsel to carry their advice - else
where. VTe will not entertain it. We
shall regard the war as won only when
the German people say to us, through
properly accredited representatives,
that they are ready to agree to a
settlement based upon justice and
the reparation of the wrongs their
rulers have done. They have done k
wrong to Belgium which must be re
paired. They have established a
power over other lands and peoples
than their own?over the great em
pire of Austria-Hungary, over hither
to free Balkan states, over Turkey,
and within Asia?which must be re
linquished.
Built Empire of Influence.
Germany's success by skill, by In
dustry. by knowledge, by enterprise
we did not grudge or oppose, but
admired, rather. She had buJJt up
j herself a real empire of trade
and influence; secured by the peace
of the world. We were content to
abide the rivalries of manufacture,
science and commerce that were
involved for us in her success and
stand or fall as we had or did not
nave the brains and the initiative
to surpass her. But the moment
when she had conspicuously won
her triumphs of peace she threw
them away, to establish in their
stead what the world will no longer
permit to be established, military
and political domination by arms,
by which to oust where she could
noi e*cel the rivals she most feared
and hated. The peace we make
must remedy that wrong. It must
deliver the once fair laijds and
happy peoples of Belgium and
northern France from the Prussian
conquest and the Prussian menace,
but it must also deliver the peoples
of Austria-Hungary, the peoples of
the Balkans and the peoples of
Turkey, alike in Europe and In Asia,
from the Impudent and alien do
minion of the Prussian military and
commercial autocracy.
We owe, it, however, to ourselves
1? "ay that we do not wish in any
iJrapa r.or to "arrange the
Austro-Hungarian empire. It is
no affair of ours what they do with
',tller Industrially
or politically. We do not purpose
or desire to dictate to them In any
way. We only desire to .ee that their

might be Impossible, also, in such
untoward circumstances, to admit
Germany to the free economic inter

Wrongs Must Be Sighted.
The wrongs, the very deep wrongs,
committed in this war will have to be

will not permit the commission of sim
