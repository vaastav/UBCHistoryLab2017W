CAN'T CHANGE IT.
(Continued from Pr On-
time provide; and bo to provide (b)
that all delegates from any state may
be chosen from the state at large, or
part from the state at large and part
from congressional districts, .in con
formity with the laws of the state in
which the election occurs?
In considering subdivision "A" of
the question, rule 12, adopted by the
conventions of 1908 and 1912, is quoted
as follows:
Rule 12 Quoted.
"Such committee shall issue the call
for the meeting of the national conven
tion within 60 days, at least, before the
time fixed for said meeting, and dele
gates to the national convention qhall
be chosen In such manner as the na
tional committee shall provide."
Upon this point the committee say3
It is its opinion "that it is at the prwj-'
ent time within the power of the na
tional committee to prescribe, as did
the call Issued by the committee for
the convention of 1912, the manner cf i
choosing both delegates at large and
district delegates to the future national
conventions; and that the national
committee may provide,- in --all Issued
for future conventions, that delegates
at large, and from congressional dis
tricts, may be chosen -ti conformity
with the laws of the 'state in which
the election occurs, and may alter the
manner of choosing such delegates as
occasion may require so as to conform
with such laws as the several states
may enact from time to time."
Subdivision "S" of this second' ques
tion Is: , . '
"Has the national committee author
ity to change the manner and method
of choosing delegates to future nation
al conventions so as to provide that all
delegates from any state may be chosen
from the state at large; or part of the
state at large and part from congres
sional districts in conformity with tfce
laws of the state in which the election
occurs?"
Committee Is Barred.
The opinion cites the rules adopted
by past national conventions providing
for the election of delegates from each
congressional district and says no ques
tion would arise as to whether or not
the national committee possessed the
power to alter the manner of choosing
delegates to the national conventions so
as to abolish congressional district rep
resentation "were it not for the word
ing of rule 12 as adopted by the con
ventions of 1908 and 1912.
"The provision of rule 12, now under
consideration, as adopted by the con
vention of 1908 is (official proceedings,
page 111):
" 'Such committee (national commit
tee) shall issue the call for the meet
ing of the national convention within
sixty days at least before the time
fixed for said meeting and delegates to
the national convention shall be chosen
In such manner as the national com
mittee shall provide.' "
The opinion continues:
"The facts recited from the histdry of
the party show that the position of the
party Is in favor of representation from
congressional districts. Nevertheless
the elimination from the rules adopted
by the convention of 1908 and 1912 of
all reference either to delegates from
congressional districts, or to delegates
at large, and the elimination of the
provisions, found in former rules, pre
scribing the manner of electing dele
gates, left, according to the terms of
the rules, the national commHtee

The Only Way Out.
"The convention undoubtedly be
lieved, in view of the historic position
of the party on the question of con
gressional district representation, that
the national committee would not issue
a call for a national convention which
did not provide for the election of dele

committee and the laws of the several

Under the terms of the rule adoptee
by the 1908 and 1912 conventions, the

Upon the third question considered,
"Has the national committee author

aeciares:
"The method provided can proper

the national committee has authority
to call a special national convention."
The fourth question considered is:
"If the national committee should
decide to call a special convention,
what would be a legal form for tha
call to be issued by the national com
mittee?" On this the opinion reads:
"In such case the national commit
tee could direct the chairman and sec

from each congressional district; six
delegates each from Hawaii and
Alaska; two delegates each from the

the Philippine islands; that for each

shall be chosen in the same manner
and at the same time to act in the
absence of the delegate. That delegates-at-large,

each state in such manner as the Re--publican

state, which has provided by law for
the election of all delegates to a na
tional convention from the state at

of such delegates on the temporary
roll of the convention.

"5. That all notices of contests shall

Congress May Act.
Washington, Dec 5. The Issue of
direct presidential primaries, brought
Into public discussion by President
Wilson's message promises to be an
important factor in deliberations of the
Republican national committee here
December 16. Many believe congress
may provide primaries that will do
away with the need of any nominating
conventions before the next presidential
election.
The decision of the law committee
of the Republican national committee
just made public leaves but one im
portant change in Republican rules to
be made by a national convention.
That relates to the basis of representa
tion. While Republican leaders here be
lieve the national committee will call
a convention for March or April some
thought the direct primary plan might
influence some committeemen against
it. It was pointed out that if a di
rect primary law were passed before
the 1916 elections the need for a change
of Republican representation would
disappear.

Dallas. Dec. 5. Hundreds of persons
driven from their homes by high water
were reported to have taken refuge in
trees . in -. the bottom, lands, about
Hearne, center of the Texas flood dis
trict today. Many more refugees -were
marooned in cotton gin houses await
ing rescue. The flood's death- toll to
day was set at 26 but this number may
be slightly increased because' -bodies
have been reported floating In the swift
muddy current at several points.
Hundreds of head -of live stock have
been drowned and scores of hogs car
ried away since rivers and creeks began
overflowing their banks after terrific
rainfall last Tuesday. Despite last

In South Waco last night scores of
persons who had returned to their
homes after Wednesday's high water
receded again were driven out by a sec
ond flood caused by a heavy rain.
Many flood victims were being taken

TWO SIDES TO STORY.
Did or Did Not Mrs. Richardson Ride
a Kali?
Waukegan, HL, Dec 6. Attorneys, In
opposing argument In the Volo rail
riding case, presented two sides of the
story to the Jury. today and a verdict
was expected by night. "..
According to the .prosecution the six
women defendants moved by malice
and envy, placed Mrs. John Richard
son, . against whom barbed gossip had
been directed for months, astride a
rail and capped their performance by
dumping her in a mill pond. As the
defense presented the story it was -a
rather a good natured charivari in
which the rail, although actually a part
of the demonstration, was not used as
a mount for Mrs. Richardson. ,.
