Taere is nothing in the wool market re*
porta (his week that is different from tbe
newAof la*t week, aDd we therefore omit
the report fiom onr columns. No change
of prices are reported, though all grades
of wool are reported as firm at full former
quotations. The excitement that existed
i in this wool region during the past week
or two has eubsidtd. and matters are
resting quiet again. From a more careful
inrvey of tbe field we are of?the opinion
that our estimates of last week of the
imount of wool recently purchased were
pwibly n little too high. A good many
of the farmers nf this county, especially,
and alrto of Jefferson, are still holding.
Tbe Oadir wool-buyers estimate that
three fifths nf tne wool clip of Harrison
county ban bean poid, and that two-flfthe,
or probably 450,000 pounds, still remain
ia tbe hands of tbe farmers.
Thk Welliiburg Herald has long main
tained that the Connellsvllle coking vein

moro abjut that shaft for coal underlying
Wellahurg and contiguous territory; but
there is talk again of a narrow guage rail*
road from Wheeling to the ConnellsviUe

Washington, December 9.?In the Sen
ate,'on f motion : of Mr. Pendleton, bo
machofthe President's annual message
as refers to civil service reform, non as
sessment of Government employes for po
litical purposes, etc., was referred to a
select commitiee to examine several
branches of seryice with instructions to
report at an early day by bill or other
wise.
On motion of Mr. Davis, of 111., the
8enate resolved that to-day's adjourn
ment be until Monday.
Mr. Pendleton introduced a joint reso
lution for tbe purpose of obtaining the
privilego of opening a highway road from
the Canada line ol tbe United States and
British America, through British Colom
bia to Fort Wrangall and Sitka, in Alaska.
Referred.
On motion of^Ir. Paddock tbe Senate
bill providing for the aale of the re
mainder of tbe reservation of confeder
ated Otoe and Missouris tribes of Indians
in Nebraska and Kansas, and- for other
purposes,'was taken up. It provides for
the sale to actual settlers of said lands,

respondence bad with t|ie legal represen
talives of the Confederate Generals,
Bragg and Polk, with a view to tho pur
chase of tbeir private papers relatina to
the late war, as per act of Juno 10,1880.
Tbe Polk papers nave been placed in the
hsnds of the Government, with permis
sion to use such as are deemed important
to the publication now authorized*by l*w.
Tbe price asked for the entire collection is

The Brsgg papers have been submitted

Eraised in '78 at $10 000, and could doubt
5Bs now be purchased at that sum. The
Secretary says that heretofore no purcha
ses for archives have been made from
Federal oflicers. The great bulk of ac
quisitions have been gilts. Ho far as tbe
Secretary knows, the only important
collections a* yet unohtained, are those
under consideration. It is for Congress
to say whether justice to those who have
freely given the mnet important docu
ments, is observed by the purchase of
collections.
The Vice President also submitted a com

the bill to apply pait of tbe proceeds of
public lands to public education, etc.
The Senate bill for the relief oi Mary A.
Lord was taken up. It grants ber M,1C0
as arrears of pension for her dead bueband.
It was opposed on technical grounds by
the members of tbe Pension Committee,
as (he requirements of the law htid not

to 33 refused to have the bill read a third
time. It thus drops.

Referred.
Mr. F.Wood,of New York, said be would
like to ascertain how many days the gen
tleman on tbe othor side intended to ob
struct public business.
Mr. Conger-I call the gentleman to or
der for unparliamentary .and insolent lan
gusse.
Mr. F. Wood?If it troubles tbe gentle
man I will withdraw that language.
Mr. Conger?There must be a limit of
tbe impertinence of gentlemen wbo make
auch. remsrks whenever a gentleman is
willing to meet the demands of bis coun
try ana bring in his funding bill for action.
We are even willing to postpone the pres
ent debate.
Mr. Wood?I thought tb? gentleman
might indicate when he would permit the
funding bill to oome before the House.
Mr. McLane then took the floor and pro
ceeded to speak on the Senste resolution,
replying especially to the speech made yes
terday by Mr. Robeson.
As that gentleman had laid down tbe
Sreposition that no judicial power could
e exercised by Congreas, except by ex
press grant, tbe twelfth article of the Con
stitution was the express grant to Con
gress to oount tbe vote tbrongh all time.
Tbe idea that tbe Vice Preaident could
count the votes; that he who might nave
a place on the ticket, should decide what
votes should be received and wtjat refect
ed, bad never been accepted in the histo
ry of tbe country. Over and over again,
had tbe subject been debated, and, un
happilv, once in tbe hiatory of the coun
try, a law bgd been passed, under tbo op?
eration of which a connt bad been made
which would forever stand a monument
of disgtace and diabonor to the country;
because that count had counted in a man
who hid not received a majority of the
electoral votes.
The twelfth article pave the House pow
er to elect the President under a certain
contingency. If the jurisdiction was con*
ferred on the tribunal on a certain com in*
gency, that tribunal was certainly to judge
when that contingency had occurred. The
Bouse must judge when the contingency
in which it might elect the President had
occurred, and the House would not judge
of that contingency unless it verified every
vote. The twelfth article imposed on the
House the actual necessity of counting
and verifying the reports.
That was a power that could not be
delegated. Knowing that the gentlemen
on the other Bide meant to set the Consti
tution at defiance, it was his hope that he
would yet live to see bis party again in
the majority in the House. If the gentle
men on the other side choose to obstruct
business until the day should come for
counting the electoral vote let them have
the responsibility, let the Democrats
await that day and when it comes let
them take their seata and see that the
votes opened by the Vice President were
genuine votes. Let them see that every
elector was qualified, and let
them take any other step they
may. feel pleased to in the way
of inquiry and investigation to know
whether the elector who had cast their
vqtes were qualified electors. If, per
chance, they should find, as was the
case in '77, that electors had voted who
were not qualified, let them bavo the
courage to refuse to certify or count such
votes, or if they found that the Vice Pres
ident had opened certificates where the
votes alleged to have been cast were for
geries, let them have the courage now and
forever to refuse such votes. Let them do
as their fathers had done. Take their
votes, appoint tellers to count the votes
and as honorable representatives
of the*people certify to the genuineness of
votes, or refuse to certify to it. He had
never met a man who had not regretted
tht necessity for an Electoral Commis
sion, but now be looked back with satis
faction upon the fact that the Democratic
party baa, both in '77 and '80, their can
didates who believed that it was the duty
of the House to count tho votes. Every
person felt that in the delegation of that
power to another tribunal the responsi
bility had been with Congress, and if
there bad been any sdame or diabonor in
its action it rested here. He had for that
reason felt at liberty to denounce. that
tribunal. He would, however, never
cast a vote to create another. He hoped
the Democrats would not be influenced
either by filibustering or by offensive
insinuations that they were hatch
ing mischief. Except in the case of
the States which had voted for Hancock;
there was no question in any State. There
was a question and a very serious question
as to the vote of the State of Georgia. He
could not conceive a more|deteatib!e|thiog
than rejecting the vote of a State, except
voting a State against its will. That wan
the crime of the Republican party. It bad
accepted perjury and forgery as a means
of certifying votes. In the face of this
fact the gentleman on the other side stood
bereaud endeaved to give the Vice Presi
dent power to count the votes. It was an
attempt at usurpation that looked to the
future, and there was no legitimate action
that was not justifiable to defeat that pur
poae.
A joint running debate then onaued,
participated-in by McLane.CAlkins, Hun
ton, Cor, (NT. Y ) and Mills, during the
course of which Mills intimated bis oppo
sition to the pending resolution on the
ground that under its provisions the Sen*
ate might declare who was President.
Mr. Lapham said that at tbe last session
he had looked upon the pending measure
ob an attempt to debauch the electoral
vote. Why were the wheels of legislation
now blocked to consider a question
when it was admitted that there
was no necessity whatever for the opera
tion of the extraordinary provisions of
the resolution? That there was lying be*
hind it some purpose, be was bound to as
sume from the tenacity with which
tho matter was pressed. Under its
provisions, questioning a return
would justify a ? majority ? in?
rejecting the vote of a Slate. It provided
that if more votes than are on the list of
electoral votes,4'or papers purporting to be
such a list," were received from a State,
either House may refuse to receive the
vote. What was this paper? An offiial
paper? Not at all, hut a paper certified
by the Chairman of a Democratic State
Committee would answer the requirements
of that provision. The Republicans were
willing to justify themselves in resorting
to every expedient known to parliament
ary usage to resist the purpose of this res
olution.
Mr. Herbert argued in opposition to the
theory that the Vice-President bad aright
to connt tbe vote. He denied that there
was any political motive which induced
the Democrats to press the matter, unless
the desire to prevent tho theory that tbo
Vice President had the power to declare
who was his successor from passing into a
precedent, were a political motive.
Mr. Newberry ipadean elaborate argu
ment in support of the proposition that
the power to count the votes was vested
in the Vice-President The proposed role
was unconstitutional in that it attempted
totafee from the President of the Senate
certain powers and rights and vest them
in the two Houses.
Pending further debate, the House ad
journed.

Washington, December 9. ?A joint
catictiB of the Republicans of the Senate
and House was bold in the ball ot the
House of Representatives for the purpose
of determining upon a party policy in re
gard to the Senate concurrent resolution,
now pending in the House, which pro*
vldes for the adoption of a specific joint
rule to regulate the counting of the
Electoral vote. Between eighty and
ninety were in attendance. The de
hate, which occupied two hours and a
half was quite general. Among those who
t <ok part were Senatora Blaine, Anthony,
Ferry, and Teller, and Representatives
Lapham, liawley, Conger, Keller, Has
kell, Butterworth, Hiscock and Robeson.
The only question upon which any differ
ence of opinion was expressed was to the
extent to which it should be considered
neceseary or advisable to oppose the
adoption of the pending rule. While
none of the speakers believed there was
anv purpose on the part of the Democrats
to attempt the renewal of the result of the
recent Presidential election, or that any
danger at the present juncture need be
anticipated from the adoption of the pro
posed joint rules, the majority held
lihat a great principle was at stake,
which might at some time affect
the stability of our institutions, and
that the policy of the party should be to
meet the isaue now and to resist, by every
known parliamentary method, the adop
tion of tbeproposition,unwarranted by the
Constitution and at variance with the
precedents of the past. At the conclusion
of the debate a vote was taken upon Judse
Lapnam's resolutions, declaring it to be
"the sense of the caucus that the Repub
lican minority should resist the adoption
of this joint rule by all means authorised
by parliamentary law," and without dis
sent it was adopted.
SlfKRMAN AND GRANT.
In the matter of the retirement of Gen
eral Sherman, the General has lately re
peatedly stated to his intimate friends that
be Bhould celebrate bis sixty-second birth
day, which comes in April next, by vol
untarily retiring from the army. He can
retire on three-fourths pay, which is about
ten thousand dollars a year. This will
give Sheridan a chance to command the
army, although the office of General of the
Army expirea with Sherman's retirement
or death. If he should retire, as contem
plated, it fa possible that Congreas will re
vive the office again and give it to Grant,
unless provision ia made for him be- 1
fore that time, which is more prob
able. Indeed, among members of Con
gress, there is considerable unanimity of
sentiment in favor of creating an office for
Grant bofore the adjournment of the ?
present Congress. This feeling is shared
by many Democrats, who are in foil ac 1
cord with the (entiments expressed by the 1
President in his message on this subject.
General Grant will arrive here on Mon
day afternoon next. He will be received |
by the Boys in Blue and other organiza
tions, though the big reception will not i
take place until the Wednesday following, i
the arrangements for which will* not be |
made until neit week. General Grant |
will be accompanied by Mrs. Grant, and |
will stop at the residence of General Beall. |
He will remain here about ten days. i
FRACTIONAL CURRENCY. .
Senator Ingalls said to day be should
press bis bill providing for the reissue of
fractional currency, lie thinks the pub
lie convenience demands a certain amount
of it for transmission through the mails.
Senator Rirkwood suggested to-day the
propriety of having instead a certificate
issued to postmasters in sheets, like
stamps, of the denomination of ten,
twenty-five and fifty contp, to be sold to
aoplioants for transmission of small
amounts through the mails, these certifi
cates to be redeemed at sub-treasuries or
national depositories. He thinks that in
this way it would be kept out of common
circulation, for which silver coin is better.

Blades, natives of Paris, from 19 to 23
rears of age, and exceedingly pretty.
They were engaged as domestics by a man
named Xavier Willeon, a resident of SE.
Louis, who represented himself as tbe
owner of a splendid new hotel in that city,
and who promised them easy work and
large wages, besides agreeing to pay tbeir
fare to this country. They were passenger*
on the Periere, and after their arrival
were taken to a French boarding house on
Wooster street. During the voyage Wil
leon dropped some hints which rendered
the sirla suspicious of his intentions to*
wards them, and at the boarding bou*e
their suspicions were confirmed. Tele
graphic inquiry to tbe St. Louis police
oronounced Willeon's hotel story a hoax,
and the girls visited Castle Garden and
made complaint against Willeon, stating
that he had all their clothing locked in bis
trunks and refused to give them up. A
detective went to the Wooster street house
and recovered the clothing, but not until
be had been compelled to knock Willeon
down. Situations have been found in
New York forall'tbreeof the girls.
S1TK FOB TBI WORLDS FAIR.
The World's Fair Committee has adopt
ed a report recommending tbe Inwood
site for the exhibition of 1883. The site is
about eight miles out tbe New York Cen
tral and Hudson River Railroad, and con
tains 250 acres.
FBARS FOR T1IB FATB OF A SHIP.
The Anchor Line steamer Victoria,
which left London November 14, has not
yet been heard from. She is now eleven
days overdue. On board were one hun
dred passengers and a valuable cargo. The
igeut thinks she has met with an accident
to her machinery. Five European steam
9rs have arrived within the past twenty
'our hours, and a number of other over
Jueve se's are expected shortly. Thesteam
era now in met heavy westerly gales and
high seas. The Rbola, twenty-five days
from Cardiff, reports a terrific g^le thai
aited from the 2lat to the 20th. On the
27th it increased to a hurricane, in which
;he ship had her life boats stove in, and
ibout twenty feet of her rail was carried
iway.
COMPLAINTS FROM IMMIGRANTS.
The steamer Switzerland, of the ReK
Star Line, which arrived vosterdav,
jrought 430 steerage passengers and 82
persons in the cabin, nearly all of tbe
ormer German and Swedish immigrauts,
jut a small party of Englishmen bound
or Nebraska were of the number. In their
ormal and sworn affidavits tbe English
party declare that the Switzerland adver
tised to sail from Hull, November 17th,and
London on the 18th, and tbe tickets they
purchased contained that contract. At
the lafit moment, however, they were told
that tbey must go to Antwerp and tho
Switzerland would not touch at English
porta. They were shipped to Antwerp in
two small coasters and lodged for the night
in filthy places with bedding made of wet
straw. Next morning they were hustled
on board the steamer, only ten minutes
being allowed for 430 passengers .to get
aboard.
TDK MISERIES Or THE VOYAGE.
Some wero rudely treated, even to the
extent of being kicked and pushed. They
found the steerage wet and dirty and tho
bedding water soaked, no separation of
sexes whatever, and only three lamps
lighted in the entire bold, and objects not
discernsble a few feet away. Men and
women slept promiscuously about during
the whole long voyage, about twenty days.
The most disgraceful immorality is said to
have prevailed. To use the language of
one of the men, "The ship was nothing
less than a floating hell." Home of tbo
passengers could find no bunks, and slept
on the deck. Some of the bunks broko
down. Only two gallons of fresh water
was furnished in the morning for four
hundred and thirty people to wash with.
It Is alleged that the officers laughed at
the passengers' complaints. The com*
plaints of the German passengers were of
the same tenor as those of the English.
Some of the sailors, also, were ill-treated,
and one man well nigh-killed.

Or Ireland, Yet Condemn* the Lnwlew

erleee.
London, December 9.?Shaw Lefevre,
the New Commissioner of Works and
Buildings, who is universally recognized
as holding the most liberal views on the
subject of the Irish land question, and
who has stated that be was advanced to
his present post specially with a view to
the servicee he could render in the debates
on the land question, in a speech at Read
ing last evening said that owership was
the higbeet degree of security known to
the law, but there were many" degrees ol
security for ibotenantashort of this wbich
might be capable ol more immediate ap
plication. The formation of a class of
peasant proprietors must, be said, neces
sarily be slow, unless we nro prepared to
expropriate the landlords at our own price.
It would be easy to show that this could
not be for the beneht of Ireland. It would
multiply the evils of absenteeism five-fold,
and would result in n6t only a fifth but all
the rent of Ireland being sent out of Ire
land in the shape of interest on the pur
chase money. The system of extended
ownership could not last if it bad its ori
gin in confiscation and robbery. What
ever is done must be with every regard to
the rights or compensation of the land
lord. He said he had no sympathy with the
plans of intimidating and methods of the
Land Leaguo. They had set up a govern
ment in opposition to that of the Queen,
and ihii was a state of things which
could not be allowed to continue.

rOBSTKE RECITES TIIE LAW.
Foreter, Chief Secretary for Ireland,
has issued a memorandum to the magis
trates pointing out that under certain
acta of Parliament persons assembling
armed or disguised, or assuming the name
of any society, to the terror of Her Ma
jesty's subjects are guilty of high misde
meanor, rendering them liable to im
prisonment, aa are also those who by
threats endeavor to compel any person to
a ait employment, or publish orwritoany
ilng calculated to incito riot or unlawful
assembly. All magistrates and constables
are bound to apprehend, oppose and dis
perse persons engaging in these practices,
and they can command all persona to as
sist them. Any two magistrates can bind
over persons whom they have reason to
suspect of even the intention to participate
in unlawful proceeding* or assombiy.or
in case of refusal to be bound over they
can commit them to j lil. They can bind
over any persons whom they believe can
give evidence relative to such proceedings
and if they refnae to be bound over or to
give evidence they can commit them to
the jail.
COMMENTS OP A G0BBB9P0N0EST.
A Dublin correspondent commenting
on Forster'a memoranda saya: The truth is
the magistrates, agents and landlords
generally are panic atricken and do not
venture to enforce the law. The prosecu
tion brought by the Attorney General at
BallingihHgiiBQ ana anotner msngo,navo
broken down, which has had a discour
aging effect There is also difficulty about
treating the Land League meetings as un
lawful aaaemblies. The magistrates don't
feel justified in regarding the threat to
Boycott as coming within the act, as it
do not imply violence.
TAX CAMPAIGN IN TIIK NORTH.
Dublin, December 0.?The Land League
ia conducting the campaign in the North
with considerable skill, modifying i'a pro
gramme to avoid offending the prejudices
of the people of Ulster. Jn that province
there is quite a different tone in their
speeches from that prevailing in other
part* of the country, with a view of con
ciliating the Presbyterians, Liberals and
Orangemen. The system of Boycotting
has been applied to six detachments of
the constabulary in different parte of Ire
land.
The man who shot and killed the Bailiff
while attempting to execute a decree

TUB NEW J?AND BILL
The features of the Government land
bill, so far art they have been made public,
are geueraily admitted to be quite satisfac
tory to the people. The bill meets the
salient points raited by tho agitators, and
| at tho same time in juit and equitable to
the landlords. The promiuer.t features are
the cUum-.i aacurinz fixity of tenure and
permitting free sale of acquired rights.
Meantime English (armors are taking ad
vantage of the agitation to secu/e increas
ed privileges for theinselvea. They de
mand that they shall have the same rights
as Irish tenants, and declare that under
the present conditions they aro unable to
compete with the producers of the United
States.
A CRISIS 1MPVKDINO AT HOKOOtlAN.
The Monaghan correspondent of the
Dubllu Exprtu telegraphed as follows last
night; "The greatest excitement prevailed
at Monaghan. Lord Roasmore was accom
panied by Lord Mandoville, who will as
list at the anti League meeting. Mande*
villo telegraphed to his ogent, at Porta
down, to send 1,000 mon to Scotatown
without delay. Another telegram was dis
patched to instruct Grand Master Arnye*
men, of Armsgb, to send 1,000 (men.
A similar telegram was pent to
Lord Grichton to send 1,000 mep
from Flamsgb. These are oortaln
to arrive. Our numbers will be more
than doubled by men from Monaghan and
the surraundiog neighborhood. The men
will all be supplied with some means of
defense. Most active efforts are now beiog
made by the Constitutional party and
leaguers to mske each meeting a success.
The assemblages will be most formidable
and perhaps roest dangerous to the peace
that has been witne#sed in Ulster for some
years, and if Ulster landlords take pattern
by the example set th?m by Lords Ross*
more, Mandeville and. Crlcbton, the
Leaguers would have little to Bay in Uliter.
THE "PALL MALL OAZITTK's" COMMENTS.
The Pall-Mall Gaxet e say*: Everybody
will aak why Forster'a memorandum, re*
minding the magistrates of the powers
they possees uncfcr the exiting lew, wu
not issued months ago. The memorandum
may be now too late. Forster may come
over to the cabinet with the request for a
coercion bill, so urgent that hia colleagues
may feel it impossible to resist. I( this be
ao, Parliament will have the right to know,
in view of his diiitorinees in reminding
the magistrates of their power, whether
he has really used up to the present time
and preeaed his subordinates to u^eallthe
instruments they already possessed.
