Ration we shall have have some hope
of gelting rid ol polygamy, e 1 an organ-'zed

Hut steps is to knock down the Tel/itorial
Government so that the polygam'sts can
no longer "tun the machine," bring the I
Territory under tho immediate supervision
ofCOnsress.nndthengoto work in earnest.

07 Department "adhere i to its conviction
that ultimately tho it'll and expedient!
method of relief from taxation, and of lim
iting Ihe revenuej to the needs of sol
economical government, must bo found in
a reduction of the duties on itnpoits."
The able Secretary of the Treasury is be
fogged. If he means what he iaye, bis
doctrine is fallacious.
A customs duty is not necerrsrlly a lax I
to fact it hsi often happened that a duty |
brought subs'intial relief from a lax im-l
posed by foreign intern'i Moreover re-l
duced revenut ] will not always follow re
duced impOit duties. The tendency of |
lower duties is to stimulate impot'rtion
?fact which the Srcrehry, in another pert I
of bis report, admit] as a mult of
the act of last session: "Wherein thol
provisions of it lersened the duties I
upon foreign articles it stimulated im
portations thereof immediately be
fore the 1st of July," the day on which
the law went into effect. Importers de jired
to have their wires reidy to throw on tho I
market at once, to Ihe detriment of Anion-1
can industries. Home manufacturers!
must meet th's competition or the in- f
creased importi continue.
It was estimated that the revision of tbo I
tariff would reduce the customs revenues
by $I5,00D,0!K). Tho Secretary eiys "these I
intentions and calculations have not been I
verified." Continuing in the fame strain, [
henys: "The estimated receipts for the
current yeir from customs aro S1S5.0C0,- [
0C0, a reduction of le?3 than $20,CC0,C0().
Conaidering that there hes been
some depression of businces
during the pest yep rand cutrent year, it ia
probable, should buslnc?s revive, that the
revenues from customs under the present
laws wPI in succeeding yeaia increase
rather Iban dimin'sh." Here we bave|
practice answering theory.
If reduced revenues be the end in view I
the shortest cut wi'l often be found in a
tariff that is practically prohlbitoiy. All
experience teaches this and the Treasury
statistics prove it.
Tns President's me ?';;e is in harmony
with the tone of bis administration,
straightforward, bcs'nejsliko, dignified,
entirely without seneitional features. He
treats the Government es a great business
concern of a multitude of partneu who
ought to be told in plain terms how
their business has gone for a year,
which aide the balance la on, what
are the prospects for tho near future and
what mersures would,in the opinion ol the
executive head, promote the concern's in
terests.
The President's recommendations are
nil conceived and deferential. Except that
there Is no reference to a national bank
rupt law?a inenrre which tho country
demands as nccfsrjry to the lar-reaching
operations ol trade?tho murage covers
about everything which comes within the
scope ot such a paper.
Legislation is asked to meet the evil of
"misted emigation;" to bring Spain to a

mltaionariea and tcacheu in the Orient,
and our citizens generally in Mexico; to

lowing in the menage ol President Arthur
transmitted to Congrats to-day.
To the Cangrea 0/ Uic Unilmd Stalci:
At Ihe threshold of your deliberations, I
congratulate you upon the favorable aspect
of the domestic and foreign affairs of this
Government. Our relations with other
countries continue to be upon a friendly
footing. With the Argentine Republic, Bel
guim, Austria, Brazil, Denmark, Hayti, Ita
ly, San to Domingo andNorwayandSweden,
no incident haa occurred which calls
for special comment. The recent opening
of new lines of telegraphic communica
tion with Central America and Brazil per
mitted the interchange of mer rages of
friendship with the Government of those
countries. During the year there have been
proclaimed consular and commercial
treaties with Servia and a consular treaty
with Koumania, thus extending our inter
course with fhe Danubian countries while
our intern relations have been put upon
a wider bas-a with treatir i with Corea and
Madagascar. The new boundai/ suwey
treaty with Mexico, a trades mark con
vention, a supplementary treaty of extra
dition with bpain, and conventions extend
ing the duration of the Franco-American
Ulaims Commiaaion have also been pro
claimed. Notice of the termination of the
i'lahenta artldn of the treaty of Wpihiug
ton wrs duly given to the British Govern
ment. and the reciprocal privileges and ex
emptions of the treaty will accordingly
cease on July ], 1885. 1
THB FIBHKBIKS INDUSTY.
The fisheries industry, puiaued by a
numerous class of out citizens on the
Northern corsts of both the Alaska and
Pacific oceans are worthy of the, fostering
care of Congress. Whenever brought into
competition with the like industries of
other countries our fishermen, as well as
our manufacturers of fishing appliances
and preparers of fish products, have main
tained a foremost place. I suggest that
Congress create a commission to consider
tie general question of our rights in the
fisheries and the means of opening to our
citlzenB under just and enduring condi
tions, the richly stocked fishing waters and
sealing grounds of British North America. |
"assistkd emigration,"
A question haa arisen touching the de
portation of the United States from the
British islands by governmental or muni-1
cipai aid of peijons unable there to gain a
living and equally a burden on the com-1
munity here. Such of these persons eil
come under the pauper class, as defined by
the law, have been sent back in accordance
with the provisions of our statutes. Herl
Majesty's government baa Insisted that pre-1
cautions have been taken before they were
shipped. However, in so many cases it hej
proven ineffectual, especially so in ccrtain
recent instances of needy emigrants reach
ing our territory through Canada, that a re
vision of our legislation upon this subject I
may be deemed advHbie. Correspondence
relative to the Clayton-Balwer treaty has
been continued and will be laid bffire
Congren. The legislation of France against
tho importation of the proposed swine pro*
ducts from the United States has been re
pealed. That result nas been due no Ices
to the friendly representations of this gov
ernment than to a growing conviotion in I
France that the restriction is not demanded
by any real danger to health.
KM HAP.GO OX SWINE.
Germany still prohibits ths introduction I
of all swine products from America. I ex
tended to the imperial government a
friendly invitation to send experts to the
United States to inquire whether the use
of these products wes dangercna to health.
This invitation was declined. I have be
lieved it of such importance, however, that
the exact facts should be ascertained and
promulgated, that I have appointed a
competent commission to make a thorough
investigation of the subject. Its members
have Mown their public spirit by accept
ing their trust without pledge of compen-1
sation, but I trust that Congrees will see,
in the national And international bearings
of the matter, a sufficient motive of pro
viding at least for the reimbursement of
such expsnaes as they may necetsarily in
cur. 1
The coronation of the Czar at Moscow
offered to this Government an Occasion for
testifying its continue friendship by send
ing a special envoy and a representative
of the Navy to attend the ceremony. While
there have arisen dnring the year no grave
questions affecting the statue in the Rus
sian Empire of American citizens of other
faith than that;beld by the national churoh,
this Government remains firm In its con
viction that the rights of its citizens abroad
should be In no way affected bv their reli
gious belief.
TRADE WITH TBS WJCST INDIFM,
It is understood that measures lor the
emoval of tlie restrictions which now bur
len our trade with Cuba and Porto Rico
ro under consideration by the Spanish
iovernment. The proximity of Cuba and
he peculiar methods of administration
thlcli there prevail necmitate constant
liscussion and appeal on our part from the
iroceedinga ol the Insular authorities. I
egret to say that the just protests of this
iovernment have not si yet produced sat
Bfactory results.
The commission appointed to decide
lertain claims of our citiiana against the
Spanish Government after the recognition
>f a f otlslactorv rule as to the validity and
orce of naturalintlon in the United Slates
IS? finally adjourned. Some of lis awards
hough made more than two years, have
lot been paid. Their speedy payment 1s
ixpected. Claims to a large amount which
mere held by the late commission to be
without its jurisdiction have been diplo
matically presented to the Sponlsh Gov
ernment. As the action of the Colonial
authorities which h?9 given rise to
those claims was admittedly illegal, full
reparation for injury sustained by our cit
itens should be no longer delayed.
UNHKTTLKD CLAIMS AOAIKST SPAIN.
The case ol The Masonic has not yet
reached a settlement The Manilla Court
lias louud that the proceedings of which
this government has complained were un
authorised, and it la hoped that the govern
ment ol Spain will not withhold the speedy
reparation which Its sense of justice shou'd
impel it to ofler for the unusnal severity
and unjuat action ol Its subordinate colonial
ofllcera in the caae ol this vessel. The Hel
vetian confederation has proposed the in
auguration of a clan of international treaties
lor the referment to arbitration of grave
questions between nationa. This govern
ment has assented to the proposed negotia
tion of such a treaty. With Switierland

New York, December 4.-?"Miss Cham
berlain has broken the ice," said a dealer
in photographs on Saturday, "and we shall
undoubtedly have other American beauties
before the year Is out. It is only a question
of time when the photographs of American
society women will be as free sold here as
such photographs are in England. Mies
Ohamoerlain Is the most beautiful Ameri
can girl in Europe to-day. or at any rate
she is the famous beauty. She hps created
a furore, and her popularity increpses every
season. She is invited everywhere, visits
the Royal family freqaently, and is a per
sonal friend of the Prince and Princess of
Wales.
"She is a Cleveland girl, and in common
with most American girls she at first ob
jected to having her picturc j sold, but she
appreciate 3 the interest the public takn in
women whom newspapers chat continually
about, and she has at last agreed to altaw
her pictures to be sold. I have the sole
right to sell them."
"Is she more beautiful than the run of
English professional beautiee?"
"Vastly, vaitly," nid the dealer, with
unction. "The majority of Ksglish beau
ties are called such because they unite a
fair amount of good looks with good
blood. So many titled women in Eng
land are absolutely plain, than when
one comc3 along who is not abso
lutely plain she is at once dubbed a beau
ty. Gladys, Lady Lonsdale, or lady Cas
tlereagh would never be called beautiful in
America. The disappointment many of
us felt on seeing Mrs. Lingtry wrj compli
mentary to our beauties. She was consid
ered the most beautiful woman in Eng
land. too."
B"\ou think it will become customary
here for society women to sell their pic
tures?"
"Why not? Don't society people fol
low English customs in everything else
accent, fox hunting, coaching, clothing and
dinners? It is only a question of time, and
very short time at that. The ball has
already been opened."

A Young JLaUyAflnnnlieil by an Uubnstf
Villain.
Bangou, Pa., December 1.?A case of at
tempted abduction h*i been reported.
About 5 o'clock Thanksgiving afternoon
Mira Eldridge, a girl about 10 yeans old,
started to walk to her unclo's house, in a
street little traveled. A man followed her,
and at a lonesome part of the city sudden
ly quickened his pace, and, catching up
witn the girl took her by the arm and eaiu:
"I want you to go with me." The girl was
frightened and sprang away from the man,
who seized her savagely by the arm again,
and said with a fearful oath: "If you make
an outcry I will kill you." She, however,
screamed as loud as she could, He con
tinued to swear at and threaten her, but
she persisted in screaming.
The villain then ran his fingers down
her throat, when she bit them so hard that
he was glad to get them out again. The
rough then made an attempt to choke her,
and would probably have succeeded if on
account of a cold her throat had not been
protected by a thick scarf. The man threw
hfcr down, but she succeeded in getting up
and screaming again. Two men who had
heard tho erits at that moment ran to the
spot and the scoundrel-fled.- The man, as
near as the girl can describe him, is about
five feet ten inchcs in height, quite stout,
has dark hair, and a heavy mustache. He
was dre:sed in dark clothes, and wore a
slouch hat. The police have tho matter
under investigation, and it is hoped a clue
has been found, and that the wretch will
be brought to justice.

in-law of the plaintiff Kelsey, slabbed him
in the neck, and then made a rush for the

Four men, armed with shot-guns, mount

Tbe Pwlilenty?The Distribution or tbe
Ofllce?-Nome Wko Haul lt<>.
From Our fytdal Cormporulcat,
Washington, lJecember 4,?The reor
ganization o! the Senate is beginning to
attract considerable attention. It is not
known whether Senator Anthony will ac
cept the position of President pro tempore
or not It is believed that Mr. Edmonds
does not desire to continue in the position,
as h<s thinks be can be of more service on
the floor as a Senator, and as Chairman of
tbe Judiciary Committee. Mr. Anthony,
however, would like to have the oppor
tunity ol declining the position, and it is
probable that nothing will be done until
he is able to be here. It is understood
that Mr. Anthony is improving very rapid
ly, and that he will be able to be in his
seat at an early day. Should he d&llne
the honor, and Mr. Edmunds refuse to
continue in the position, there is talk that
a Western Senator will be selected for the
place. In this connection the name of
Senator John J. Ingalls, of Kansas, has
been prominently mentioned, and it is nfe
to anume that if any Senator other than
Mr. Anthony or Mr. Kdmnnds is seated
that Mr, Ingalls will be the Senator elected
to succeed Mr. Edmunds. Mr. Ingalls is
one of the ablest Senators from the West
and has no superior as a parliamentarian.
For the position of Bergeant-at-Arme
ex-Sergeant-at-Arms Hooper, of the House
ol Representatives, is most prominently
mentioned For the position of Secretary
George (iorham is still the caucui nomi
nee, but there are six Senators who are
quoted as saying that they will not vote for
Gorbam. It is reported that Mr. Edmunds
is opposed to calling a caucus. He is
willing that ths Senate should elect a pre
siding officer, have them make up the com
mittees and retain the same stair af officers,
with the exception of filling the vacant
Secretaryship. The Senate is equally divi
ded, tbe absented not being paired on re
organijatlon. This .leaves the balance of
power in the hands of Mahone and Riddle
berger. At all evenls it is not believed
that any change will be made for several
dayi probably a week.
Wn??; TUE OI'ILIjOTINS FALLS.
When the guillotine does fall there are
several West Virginians whose heads will
probably be chopped. Iu the Secretary's
office there is ex-Delegate B. H. Lurty, of
Clarksburg, who was appointed by Senator
Camdsn about two and a half years ago t3
succeed ? Manning, who was one ol ex
Senator Hereford's appointees. The pool
tion pan about t2,10u per annum.
Mr. O. L. Cross, of Jefferson county, who
il Militant Sergeant-it-Arms, drawl f 1,1ft)
per annum. Mr. Croea was appointed in
1879 and ia one o! the most efficient and
popular Office? of the Senate, as at present
organized.
l'reeton Price, of Parkereburg, holda a
poeltlon aa messenger, and ia assigned to
duty aa doorkeeper of the Senator'a private
gallery, on the Democratic aide. Price's
compensation ia $1,440 per year. He vaa
appointed upon the request of ex-Senator
Henry Q. Davie, sometime in 1877, and
baa been drawing the salary ever since.
Mr. T. J. Burke, of Huntington, is an the
rolls aa a skilled laborer, at a salary of
$1,000 per annum. He was appointed in
1870 upon the joint recommendation of ex
Senators Davis and Hertford. He per
forms only as doorkeeper to the gentle
men's gallery. He is one of the moet effi
cient and gentlemanly members of the
Sergeant-at-Arma' staff.
Another West Virginian on the Senate
pay roll is Mr. Thomaa Kellir, of Barbour
county, at a salary of $1,100 per annum.
Mr. kellar was appointed upon the request
of ex-Senator Davie in 187V. He has ably
performed the duties of policeman at the
Senate end of the Capitol. Besides the
above there ia one page who receives a per
diem compensation of $2 50 daring the eee
eion. It ia probable that wheo the Senate
is reorganized all of these prominent Weet
Virginlana will be retired to private life,
but it is a question of doubt whether any
ofthepreeent incumbents will be disturbed,
at any rate they are all in a state of nerv
ousness in consequenoe of the uncertainty
now existing.

Erie, Pa., December 4.?The numerous
lake accidents which have cccurred daring
the past season on the chain ol great lakes
has revived a terrible episode in the life of
an Erie merchant, A. V>\ Bills, who, when
a lad ol thirteen, went a sailing. That
merchant Is the only survivor of the brig
Seizer, owned by Dr. Ainsworth, of Buffalo,
and sailed by Captain Eastwick, who, with
the crew, perished in sight ol Erie in an
awful gale. SaidMr.Blila,fshesatdownon
a tea chest in his little one-story grocery, at
Tenth and State street!, Erie: Wnen I read
the accounts of the trials that the sailors
have nowadays it reminds me of my early
days before the mast. In the seem of
1847, about September, I wp \ aboard the
Seiier. We were bound for Chicago, light,
and when we were oil' Big Beaver Island,
Lake Michigan, we were becalmed. Sud
denly, and before the lookout could call
the watch or let go the halyards, a white
squall struck us on the starboard side. I
was in the watch below, In the twinkling
of an eye I felt her go. I sprang /or the
companion way and wob met by the water.
When almost on deck I wri seized by the
seat of the breeches by a Scotch sailor, and
the next instant I was floundering on the
forecastle deck.
IN UTTER DABKHES3.
By the time I wai op I found myself in
otter darkness and I knew the vec3el was
over, and I was ond6i her. Above the roar
of the storm I coold hear Captain East
wick calling me. It was tlien the Scotch
man told the captain I had gone oot ahead
of him. "Then," said the cap'aio, "poor
Andy is gone to Davy Jones' locker, for he
couldn't Bwim a stroke." I could hear the
crew scrambling around in their effort) to
hold on to the keel, for the Bhip was rolling
terribly. I called ?s loud as I could to
them, but got 110 answer, and when a
passing ship came along and took them
iff and left me my heart Bank
within me and all hope oi ever being
rescued was gone The air in the
vessel kept her well up, but being un
able to swim I did not dare to try to es
cape by diving from under the vowl. from
the companion way, and therefore felt that
it was only a matter of a little time when
I must give up. I was almost paralyzed
with fear, and es the water slowly rose
around me I Buffered untold agony. I
could tell by the color or appearance o
the water at the hatch when ft was night
*nd when dark. The crew had rationed
in the forecastle and X wi's able to gather
enough to eat from the Bea bread which
floated to me. I had been in what X be
lieved to be my living grave two days and
two nights, when I felt the Bhip pitch.
A SUPREME MOMENT.
I felt the topmeet scratch the botton,and
thinks X "Jack you are nearer hell nor
heaven this time," for I wes mortally afraid
the mast would be driven through the hull
and let the air out, when death would re
sult in a few minutes. You may imagine
how reUeved I felt the third time she
struck, for I could hear the topmast go, and
I felt that I had a new lease on life. An
hour or two afterwards my feare were again
aroused by feeling the fore topma it strike,
but in a short time it too broke. At times
I wss in hopes that the venel would
to be found and righted before I perished,
but again a rushing noise made me fearful
that being in the channel, and without a
light or anything to point out the boll in
the dark, it wss liable to be run into by
passing veeiels, and thus settle my late.
While brooding over my deeperate situa
tion with dismal,forebodings, intermingled
with thoughts oi my dear ones at home, 1
was suddenly picked up as in a giants
jraspand hurled acroes tho deck, and
In a moment Itoiind myself in the com
panionway, with the Bky above me.
1X18 PRAYEB8 ANSWERED.
The God of the seas had heard and an
swered my prayere, and the storm had
tipped the vessel over. As soon as ahe
turned back on her keel I hurried as fast
u my exhausted conditisn would allow
me, and, gaining the deck, let go the brig
anchor, which brought her head to. There
?he rode the sea all night, and the next
day I had the gratification of sighting a
vessel, and by means of my red Bhirt
which I used as a signal caught the atten
tion of the lookout, and in a short time
the propeller Pbcuuix came along-side,
took me aboard and gave me what care a
lad in my condition needed, and taking
he line of what X believed to be my living
coffin towed it Into lllg Beaver harbor. Ab
soon as I got my pay X left the ship, and
none too soon, tor on her trip down she
went to pieces between trie and Four-Mile
Creek, and aU hands were drowned. I

Uniontown, Pa., December 4.?To-mor
row morning will murk the "commence
ment of a murder trial in this county which
ia perhaps unparalled in history. The de
fendant, afl your readers will guees, U
Jam06 Nutt, who* name Ifl now familiar
to the newspaper reading public. Already
the streets of Uniontown are filled with
strange facee. and the hotels are crowded.
It would really Beem that the people out
Bide of Fayette county take as much In
terest in young Nutt's trial ?fl thoee who
have known the Nutt family for years.
Viewing the young avenger from the
popular standpoint, ho has nothing to fear,
but his relations and thoee most deeply in
terested in the trial are not over confident.
The popular voice says "Jim Nutt will
walk out of the comt room a free man."
Othere (and they are his friends) look
through darker glasses, and carefully weigh
ing the anticipated evidence on both aides
exprers the opinion that the scale of justice
will not balance. The latter dais argue to
themselvrs and others that young Nutt
commi. ted a premeditated crime, that all
the elements of murder are to be seen in
his act, and that if the jury steps into the
box without pr-sion, fear, favor or affect
ion, pledging themselves to be governed
only l>y tbelawand the evidence, a con
viction Is inevitable.
UNCEBTAINTV OF JCRISS.
Of couree all this talk is pretty much a
waste of wind, as there is no telling what
juries will do, nor is the line of defense
fully known. An opinion, however, shared
in alike by all parties, and which is, more
over, a feasible one, is that Nutt, even if
convicted of the highest grade ol murder,
would not have long to wait for a pp rdon.
The counsel for both aides will be here this
evening, and the District Attorney has put
the case of "The Commonwealth vs. James
Nutt," flrat on to-morrow's trial list.
Mrs. Nutt, at her son's request, visited
him twice to-day, once in tho morning and
once in the afternoon. That distrened
look which rested on her face when fliJt
informed of her son's crime is again notice
able on her pale, emaciated face. Nor is
the prisoner's appearance lees calculated
to arouse public sympathy. Although he
hss borne up bravely, still, the. Hollow
eyes, sallow complexion, and ambling gate,
tell the stoiy of his long imprisonment
Tilfi CASE REVIEWED.
In connection with the foregoing it is
pertinent to give a brief statement of the
case condensed, Capt A. 0. Nutt was
killed by Nicholes Lyman Dukes on Sun
day morning, December 24, 1882. Dukes
bad been engaged to his daughter, and took
advantage of this intimacy to cast reflec
tions upon her virtue. He wrote a letter
to Capt Nutt, in which he plainly intima
ted that his daughter had accomplished
her own ruin, and that he wsb not the au
thor of it. To this scurrilous epistle Nutt
replied, stating that he would hold him
(Dukes) responsible. Dukes answered
with another villainous letter, concluding
by inviting Captain Nutt to meet him for
a friendly conference.
On December 23d Captain Nutt ar
rived home. The next morning he went
to the room of Dukea In the Jennings
House for the conference which the latter
had suggested. There they had a fight.
After they had been separated by men at
tracted to the room by the struggling.
Dukes drew a revolver and instantly killed
Nutt In the following March Dnkes w?3
tried and and acquitted.
Public indignation was aroused, hot
Dukes insisted upon remaining id Union
town. One evening in June last he met
young Nutt on Main Btreet, and laughed in
his face.

It was reported verbatim at the time for

I deny that the United States is a nation.
It ia a vicious system that hes destroyed
sovereign States and the opprersed nine
millions of people in the South. If a State
has no right cf secession she certainly haB
the right of revolution. The Republican
party wants another amendment to the
constitution. Why do they want it? It is
not that the government shall take
the school fund into its own hands and
appoint a commissioner who Bhall
Belect the teachers and series of
books to be used in the schools, and
your child and my child be denied the
right to learn the alphabet except in such
a book as shall learn them to forget Wash
ington, Jackson, Jefferson, and the states
men of Virginia and the South. The most
infamous order ever issued wes that of the
attorney general only a few days ago,
which caused sixty companies ol soldiers
to march to South Carolina to take charge
of the ballot box, and overawe the voters
of that poor downtrodden state, the para
dise of carpet baggers and scalawags. But
the day will come when South Carolina
will, under Democratic rule, take her place
beside Virginia and other sovereign statea
and rid herself ol the Barbarous politics

carcass for the last eleven years, and rob
