TO 088 EBIENBB IR OOHDONSVILLE
AND ADJOINING COUNTIES,
in presenting you the first number
•ofthe Native Virginian from this point,
we have naturally a few suggestions to
make, A portion of them are so point
edly and torcibly set fortli in a Western
paper, that we give the entire extract.
Discussing the subject of "tlie local pa
per," our contemporary says.
"What tells us so readily the standard
of a town or a city as tiie appearance of
its paper? And its youth M Its age can
as well be determined by tlie observing
as by a personal notice. The enter
prise ol its citizens is depicted by it*
advertisements, their liberality by tlie
looks of the paper. Some paper* show
a good, solid, healthy foundation, ple
thoric purses, and a well-to-do appear
ance generally; others show a striving
to contend with the grasping thousands
at omul theni, trying hard to wrench an
existence irom their cloae-tlsted ccm
nuinities. An occasional meteoric dis
play in its columns of tehgraph or lo
cal, or ef editorial, showi what It can
do if it had the means; but it can tint
continue iv the expensive work unti;
support conies, which ought to be read
ily granted. A newspaper is iiko a
church—it wants fostering in the coni
mt-ino men t, aml for a few yens; then, Si
a general thing, it can walk alone, and
icllect ei-edit upon its location. Take
your home paper—it gives you more
newi of immediate interest than any
other psper can possibly do; it talks
for you when otberlocalities belie you;
It stands up for your rights; you always
have a champion in your home paper ;
aud thine who stand up for you should
certainly bo well sustained. Your in
terests are kimired and equal, and you must
rise or fall together. Therefore, it is to you?
interest to mpport your home paper, not
ftrudrjingly, b\t in a liberal spirit; as a pleas
ure, not as a disagreeable du.y, bit as a;.
IHVESTUENT THAT WILL AMPLr PAT TUB tXf
rSNIHTIBE."
We have but littlo to add to this.—
Our aim is to give you a live, bright,
useful and inlluential paper—one that
will do credit to this section of the
State, and add to your population and
wealth. Advertisements and subscrip
tions we need, of course ; without them
there can be no paper. Every adver
tisement helps the publisher, ar.d eve
ry subscriber help* the advertiser even
wore than tha publisher. Hut what we
dceire especially is tlie county news of
Orange, Greene, Madison and Louisa.
Give us that. Lo not, think anything
too small. Whatever is of sufficient in
terest to make two men stop in the
street and talk will interest a thousand
readers. Give us the new* ot these four
counties, and we ptoml«e you one ol
the best country papers in Ihe Stats or
•We inter d to devote ourselves to the
material interests of this town aud sec
tion. The site is favorable tor au in-
Issd town of -considerable magnitude,
and our excellent soil and superb cli
mate will bring abundant immigration.
Year by year it will increase. We
liavetiere tlie junction of two of tlie
most important railroads In tho United
States, and to these will soon be added
a third—the road to Winchester—and
perhaps a fourth. The place is bound
to grow. We wantto hasten its growth,
to grow and prosper with it, and to this
end shall exert our titmoit powers. Wn
lhall advocate not only the railroad
which the citizens of Greeneand Madi
lon io much need, but a syeteio of first
rate county roads, branching off from
this town, as well. Whatever etiter
priie has for its object tho material,
moral and intellectual welfare of out
people, lhall receive our cordial sup
port. Our ambition is to thrive by
their thrift, to prosper in Iheir prosperi
ty. We have no aeparate, petty s lflsh
Interest to subserve.
That you are not rich and that you
cannot do all that you would like to do
for the paper, we know full well. But
the diipoiition is everything. Take a
real interest in the paper, and show it
by your acts. Come, then ; let us join
hands, heads and hearts, and -we will
make the Native Virginian a success
and Gordonsville a great success.

It "oi'ld be difficult to overestimate
the value ot this book to men of all
classes, ni d particularly to those who
belong to the learned professions. It
is a dictionary of dales, and at the same
time a chronicle and a chronology of
the World's Progress down to the pres
ent year; and tlie Publishers are war
ranted in the assertion that thty are
•'conlident that they are offering the
Public the hest aud completest work ol
the kind ever published." The volume
contains upwards ol Fifteen Thousand
Attiolcs*, alphabetically arranged ; and
from the selection of its materials, says
the author, Mr. Hayder, "it must be
Important to every man, learned 01 un
learned, connected with tlie professions
or engaged in trade." Tlie American
Editor, Mr. Vincent, adtls that his aim
'•has been throughout, to make the book
hot a mere Dictionary of Dates, but a
dated Encyclopedia, a digested sum
mary of every department of human
history brought down },o the very eve
of publication.*' The book IS bound Bl

The Harpers, we believe, do not er
gage in holiday publications, but we
venture the assertion that there, is not
a gilt book issued this season which will
give more intense pleasure to youths
than this volume of Mr. Greenwood's.
The title is -veil chosen but gives a very
meagre idea of the contents,which tell of
the nature, habits and Bud* of hunting the
elephant, lion, puma,gorilla, rhinoscer
o», tiger, hippopotamus, leopard, pan

picltues tire copious and well executed,
and ihe descriptions ol hunting scenes
are oftentimes thrilling. The danger
U that the book will half-craze the hoys
who read it.
We have also to thank Meius. West

TIGgT TIMES.
We have known this fellow, I'imes,
for two a-id forty years, and during
that entire period he ha* been tight.—
lie is always tight. A man named
Baldwin seems to have met him once in
Alabama when he was Hush ; hut aa a
rule, especially 111 Virginia, he is inva
riably tight. During the war, lie was
on a tremendous "bust," and new he
is almost as tight ss hu was then. .Some
times he is called Hard Times tor short.
He is a wcll-mesuing fellow, aud at in
tervals does his best to relorni. But. it
is no use—he will get tight again. He
lias been getting worse for the last
month or so, and i« if possible tighter
than ever. Indeed, he is very tight.—
He is as tight as a drum—tight as a tick
--tight as bricks—light as the Emperor
Titus when lie took Jerusalem, lie is
really tight. People abuse the poor
creature, but what good docs that do?
He is on a bender—on a tear—o:l a high
old drunk. He lias got the horrors—the
delirium t>-ian&le_--und he sees snakes.
Fact is, Times is 111 a bad way; he can't
stand this much longer; he'll go up ;
it'll be the last ot him ; and we feci very
sorry for him. Poor old Times ! He's
pow'ful tight.
BEPUBLICAN PABIY IN VIKU.NI&.
A Washington correspondent ofthe
Itiehmond Whig makes the following
announcement:
"The future attitude ol parties lv

is certain; the restoration of Virginia
sounds the death knell of the party
names now in vogue in Virginia.
There can be no longer a Walker party
a Withers party, a Wells party, or any
other man's party. Virginia must be
Democratic or Republican, and that in
name and fact too. it is believed that

Plournoy, Stuart, Marshall, Mahono,

Calisaya or King's Bark was unknown until the middle of tbe 17th
century. Humboldt makes favorable mention of its febrifuge qualities as
an antidote to Fever and Ague, Intermittent and Malarious Fevers, in ms
extensive South American travels.
In 1640 it was used by the Jesuits, who alone at that time possessed
the secret of its wonderful tonic properties, and it was sold by them for
its own weight in silver.
In 1658, eighteen years after, Sir John Talbot employed it with great
success in France in the treatment of Fever and Ague, Dyspepsia,
Nervous Affections, Loss of Appatite, Weakness and Debility, Palpitation
of the Heart, Diarrhoea, etc. In 1679 he sold the secret of its origin
to Louis XIV, by whom it was divulged. It is now the all important
ingredient in Drake's PLANTATION BITTERS, and preserved as it is
'in pure St. Croix Rum, makes a tonic of rare merit, and one that should
be upon the side-board of every family. Messrs. P. H. Drake & Co., the
sole proprietors of the celebrated PLANTATION BITTERS, are the
largest importers of Calisaya Bark in America The Bark is gathered
and cured under the immediate supervision of an agent sent out to
Brazil, expressly for that purpose, and aside from a few thousand
pounds which are sold to the manufacturers of Quinine, is all used in
the preparing of these Bitters, to which they are indebted for their
wonderful success as a tonic.
The above cut represents the natives in ;heir own native forest
gathering the Bark.
