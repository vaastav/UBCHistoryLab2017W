Washington, D. C., Dec. 4.—The pres
ident spoke as follows:
"Gentlemen of the Congress—- .•
"Eight months have elapsed since I
last had the honor of addressing you.
They liave been months crowded with
•events of immense and grave signifi
cance- for us. I will not undertake to
detail, or even to summarize* those
events, or the part'we have played in
them. This will be laid before you in
the reports of the executive aepart
•trients. I shall discuss only our present
•outlook upon these vast affairs, -our
•present duties and the immediate means
•of accomplishing the objects we shall
hold always in view.
War Aim Is to Win.
"I shall not ro back to debate the
•causes of the war. The intolerable
wrongs done and planned against us
by the sinister masters of Germany
uve since become too grossly
-obvious and odious to every true Amer
'can to heed to be rehearsed." But I
•shall ask you to consider again and
with a very grave scrutiny our objec
tives and the measures by which we
mean to attain them for the purpose of
discussion here in this place is action
ana, our action must move straight to
wards definite ends. Our object- is
of course to win the war. and we shall
not slacken or suffer ourselves to be
diverted until it is won. But it is
worth while asking.and answering the
question 'when shall we consider the
war won?"
'_et Pacifists Strut, fgffi
From one point of view it Is not
necessary to broach this fundamental
,. matter. I do not doubt that the Ameri
can people knov what the war is about
ana what sort of an outcome they will
regard as a realization of their pur-
P°s® 'n it- As a nation we are united
In spirit and intention. I pay little
to those who tell me otherwise.
I near the voices of dissent—who does
hea.r the
criticism and the clamor
of the noisy, thoughtless and trouble
some. I also hear men here and there
fang themselves in impotent disloyalty
against the calm, indomitable power of
the nation. I hear men debate peace
who understand neither its nature nor
the way in which we may attain it,
with uplifted eyes and unbroken spirits.
~*ut I know that none of these speaks
for the nation. They do not touch the
heart of anything. They may safely be
left to strut their uneasy hour and be
forgotten.
But from another point of view I
believe that it is necessary to say plain
ly what we here at the seat of action
•consider the war to be for and what
part we mean to play in the settlement
•of its searching- issues. We are the
spokesmen of the American people and
they have aright to know whether their
purpose is ours. They desire peace by
the overcoming of evil, by the defeat,
•once for all, of the sinister forces that
Interrupt peace and render it impos
sible, and they wish to know how close
*y
our
thought runs with theirs and
what action we propose. They are im
patient with those who desire peace by
•any sort of compromise—deeply and
indignantly impatient, but they will be
equally impatient with us if we do not
mal:e it plain to them what our objec
tives are and what we are planning for
in peeking to make conquest of peace
by arms.
Peace Terms Are Stated.
I believe that 1 speak lor tnem when
I .say two things:
B'i-' rst, that this intolerable thing of
which the masteis of Germany have
•shown us the ugly face, this menace of
•combined intrigue and force which we
now see so clearly as the German
power, a things without conscience or
honor or capacity for covenanted
peace, must be crushed, and if it be not
utterly brought to an end, at least shut
•oiit iiom the friendly intercourse of the
nations and, second, that when this
thing and its pp,wertare indeed defeated
anu the time comes that we can discuss
peace—when the German people have
spokesmen whose word we can believe,
and when those spokesmen are ready
in the name of their people to accept
the common judgement of the nations
•as to what shall henceforth be the bases
of law and of covenant for the life of
the world—we shall be willing and glad
to jj.'.y the full price for peace and pay
it ungrudgingly. V»'e know what that
price will be. It wilj be full, impartial
justice—justice done at every point
-and to every nation. The final settle
ment must affect our enemies as well
as our l'riends.
Against Punitive Indemnities.
"You catch, with men, the voices of
humanity that ore in the air. They
gl-o\v daily more audible, more articu
late, more persuasive, and they come
from the hearts of inen everywhere.
They insist that the war shall not end
in vindictive action of any kind that
no nation or people shall be robbed or
punished because the irresponsible rul
ers a single country have themselves
done clrep and abominable wrong. It is
this thought that has been expressed in
the formula, no annexations, no con
tributions, no punitive indemnities,'
Just because this crude formula ex
presses the instinctive judgment as to
right of plain men everywhere, it has
been made diligent use of by the mas
ters f-f German intrigue to lead the peo
ple of Russia astray—and the people
of every country t'neir agents could
reach, in order that a premature peace
might be brought about before auto
cracv has been taught its final and con
vincing lesson, and the people of the
world put in control of their own des
tinies.
Declares Idea Is Good.
"But the fact that a wrong use has
been made of a just idea, is no reason
why a right use should not be made of
it. It ought to be brought under the
patronage of its friends. Let it be
sai'l again that autocracy must first be
shown the utter futility of its claims
to power or leadership in the modern
world. It is impossible to apply any
standard of justice so long as such
forces are unchecked and undefeated
as the present masters of Germany
•command. Not until that has been
d'»ne can right be set up as arbiter and
peacemaker among nations. But when
that has been done—as God ^willing, it
assuredly will be—we shall at last bo
free to do on unprecedented thing, and
this is the time to avow our purposes to
•do it. We shall be free to base peace
on generosity and justice, to the ex
clusion of all selfish claims to advan
tage. even on the part of victors.
Determined to Win War.
"Let there be no misunderstanding.
Our present and immediate task is to
win the war and nothing shall turn us
ii' aside from it until it is accomplished.
3Ev.ery power and resource we possess,
whether of men, of money, or of mate-
rials, is being tlevoted and will continue
*1 -to be devoted to that purpose until it is
achieved. Those who desire to bring
'-'peace about before that purpose is
-".fnchieved I counsel to carry their ad
"|yice elsewhere. We will not entertain it.
'?We shall regard the war as won only
f, „*-when the German people say to us,
through properly accredited represent
^y.'atives. that they are ready to agree to a
'f-i ^-settlement based upon justice and the
.-.at ion of the wrongs their rulers
'v., /{have done. They have done a wrong
Belgium, which must be repaired.
Thev have established a power over
w»l other lands and peoples than their own
—oVer the erent empire of Austria-
'i
Hungary, over hitherto free Balkan*
states, over Turkey and within Asia—
which must be relinquished.
Gormany's Exploits Reviewed. 'tV.
"Germany's success by skill, by
""'In
dustry. by knowledge, by enterprise, we
did not grudge or oppose, but admired
rather. She had built up for herself a
real empire of trade and influence, Re
cured by the peace of the world. We
were content to abide the rivalries of
manufacture, science, and commerce!
that were involved for Us in heir sue
cess and stand or fall as we had or did
not have the brains and the initiative
to surpass her. But at the moment
when she had conspicuously won her
triumphs of peace she threw them
away to establish in their* stead what
the world will no longer permit to be
established, military and political dom
ination by arms, by which to oust,
where should could not excel the rivals
she most feared and hated. The peace
we make must remedy that wrong. It
must deliver the once fair lands and
happy peoples of Belgium and northern
France from the Prussian conquest and
the Prussian menace, but it must also
deliver the peoples of Austria-Hungary,
the peoples of the Balkans and the peo
ple of Turkey, alike in Europe and in
Asia, from the impudent and alien dom
ination of the Prussian military and
commercial autocracy.
"We owe it, however, to our
selves to say thai we do not wish
in any way to impair or to rear
range the Austro-Hungarian em
pire. It is no affair of ours what
they do with their own lifej- either
industrially or politically. We do
not purpose or desire to dictate to
them in any way. We only desire
.to see that their affairs are left in
their own hands, in all matters,
great or small. We shall hope to
secure for the peoples of the Bal
kan peninsula and for the people of
Turkish empire the' right and op
portunity to make their own lives
safe, their own fortunes
(secura
against oppression or injustice and
from the dictation of foreign courts
or parties. And our attitude and
purpose with regard to Germany
herself are of a like kind. We in
tend no wrong against the German
empire, no interference with her
internal affairs*^should deem
either the one' or. the other abso
lutely unjustifiable, absolutely con
trary to the principles we have
professed to live by and to hold
most sacred throughout our life
as a nation.
1
No Threat Against Germany.
"The people of Germany are being
told by .the men whom th6y now per
mit to deceiive them and to act as
their masters, that they are fighting
for the very life ana existence of their
empire: a war of desperate self de
fense against deliberate aggression.
Nothing could be more grossly or wan
tonly false and we must seek by the
utmost openness and candor as to our
real aims to convince them of its
falseness. We are, in fact, fighting for
their emancipation from fear, along
with our own. from the fear as well
as from the fact of unjust attack by
neighbors or rivals or schemers after
world empire. No one is threatening
the existence or the independence of
the peaceful enterprise of th German
empire.
"The worst that can happen to the
detriment of the German people is this
that if they should still, after the war
is over, continue to be obliged to live
finder ambitious and intriguing mas
ters interested to disturb the peace of
the world, men or classes of men
whom the other peoples of the world
could not trust, it might be impossible
to admit them to the partnership of
nations which must henceforth guaran
tee the world's peace. That partnership
must be a partnership of peoples, not
a mere partnership of governments. It
might be impossible also in such un
toward circumstances to admit Ger
many to the free economic intercourse
which must inevitably spring out of the
other partnerships of a real peace. But
there would be no aggression in that
and such a situation, inevitable because
of distrust, would in the very nature
of things sooner or later cure itself by
processes which would assuredly set in.
Germany Is Protected.
"The wrongs, the very deep wrongs,
committed in this war will have to be
righted. That, of course. But they
cannot and must not be righted by the
commission of similar wrongs against
Germany and her allies. The world
will not permit the commission of sim
ilar wrongs as a means of reparation
and settlement. Statesmen must by
this time have learned that the opinion
of the world is everywhere wide awake
and fully comprehends the issues in
volved. No representative of any self
governed nation will dare disregard it
by attempting any such covenants of
selfishness and compromise as were
entered into at the congress of Vienna.
The thought of the plain people here
and everywhere throughout the world,
the people who enjoy no privilege and
have very simple and very unsophisti
cated standards of right and wrong,
that is the air all governments must
henceforth breathe if they would live.
It is in the full disclosing light of that
thought that all policies must be con
ceived and executed and executed in
this midday hour of the world's life.
German rulers have been,able to upset
the peace of the world only because the
German people were not suffered, un
der their tutelage, to share the com
radeship- of the other peoples of the
world, either in thought or in purpose.
They were allowed to have no opinion
of their own which might be set up as
a rule of conduct for those who ex
ercise:! authority over them. But the
congress that concludes this war will
feel the full strength of the tides that
run now in the hearts and consciences
of free men everywhere. Its conclu
sions will rvn with thone tides.
All these things have been true from
the very beginning of this stupendous
war: and I "cannot help thinking that
if they had been made plain at the
very outset, the sympathy and enthus
iasm of the Kussian, people might have
been once for all enlisted on the eide
of the allies, suspicion and distrust
swept away and a real and lasting
union of purpose affected. Had they
believed these things at the very mom
ent of their revolution had they been
confirmed in that belief since, the sad
reverses which "have recently marked
the progress'of their affairs towards a
stable government of free men have
been avoided. The Russian people have
been poisoned by the very same false
hoods that have kept the German peo
ple in the dark and the poison has been
administered by the very same hands.
The only possible antidote is the truth.
It cannot be uttered too plainly or too
often.
Insures Germany Freedom.
"From every point of view, thereifore,
it has seemed to be my duty to Bpeak
these declarations of purpose, to add
these specific interpretations to what
I took the liberty of saying to the
Senate in January. Our entrance into
the war has not altered our attitude
towards the settlement that must come
when it is over. When 1 said in January
that the nations of the world were en
titled not only, to free pathways upon
the sea, but also to assured and unmo
lested access to those pathways I was
m,
'm
arAitfis
thinkin&and I am thinking now, not
of the smaller and weaker nations
alone, which need our countenance aiid
support, but also of thegreat and
powerful nations, and of our present
enemies as well as our present asso
ciates in the war. I was thinking, and
am thinking now, of Austria herself,
among the rest, as well as, of Serbia
and of Poland. Justice and equality of
rights can be had pnljr at a great price.
We are seeking, "permanent, not tem
porary foundations for the peace of the
world and must seek them candidly
and fearlessly, as always the right will
prove to be the expedient.
"What shall we do, then, to push this
great war of freedom and Justice to Its
righteous conclusion? We must clear
away with a thorough hand all imjedir
menta to success and we must make
every adjustment of law that will fa
cilitate the full and free use of our
whole capacity and force as a fighting
unit.
Recommends War on Austria.
"One very embarrassing obstacle
that stands in'our way is'that we are
at war with Germany but not with her
allies. I therefore very earnestly rec
ommend that the congress immediately
declare the United States Jin a state
of war with Austria-Hungary. Does
it seem strange to you that this should
be the conclusion of the argument I
have Just addressed to you? It is not.
It is, in fact, the inevitable. logic of
what I have said. Austria-Hungary is
for the time being not her own mis
tress, but simply the vassal of the Ger
man government. We must face the
facts as they are and act upon them
without sentiment in this stern duty.
The government of Austria-Hungary is
not acting upon its own initiative or in
response to the wishes and feelings of
its own peoples but as the instrument
of another nation. We must meet its"
force with our own and regard the cen
tral powers as but one. The war can
be successfully conducted in no other
way. The same logic would lead also
to a declaration of war against Turkey
and Bulgaria. They also are the 'tools
of Germany. But they are mere tools
and do not yet stand in the direct path
of our necessary action. We shall go
wherever the necessities of this war
carry us, but it seems to me that we
should go only where immediate and
practical considerations lead us and
not hee'd any others.
Urges Check on Aliens.
"The financial and military measures
which must be adopted will suggest
themselves as the war and its under
takings develop but I will take the lib
erty of proposing to you certain other
acts of legislation which seem. to, me
to be needed for the support of" the
war and for the release of our whole
force and energy.
"It will be necessary to extend in
certain particulars ,the legislation of
the last session with regard to alien
enemies and also necessary I believe,
to create a very definite and particular
control over the entrance and depar
ture of all persons into and from the.
United States.
"Legislation should be enacted defin
ing as a criminal offense every wilful
violation of the presidential proclama
tions relating to alien enemies promul
gated under section 4067 of the revised
statutes and providing appropriate
punishments, and women as well as
men should be included under the
terms of the acts, placing restraints
upon alien enemies. It is likely that
as time goes on many alien enemies
will be willing to-be fed and housed at
the expense of the government in the
detention camps and it would be the
purpose of the legislation I have sug
gested to confine offenders among
them in penitentiaries and other simi
lar institutions, whore they could be
made to work as other criminals do.
Wants More Price Limits.
"Recent experience has convinced me
that the congress must go further in
authorizing the government to set
limits to prices. The law of supply
and demand, I am sorry to say, has
been replaced by the law of unre
strained selfishness. While we have
eliminated profiteering in several
branches of industry it still runs im
pudently rampant in others. The farm
ers, for example, complain with a great
deal of ju-stice that while the regula
tion of food prices restricts their in
comes,- no restraints are placed upon
the prices of most of the things they
must themselves purchase and similar
inequities obtain on all sides.
"It is imperiatively necessary that
consideration of the full use of the
waterpower of the country and also
the consideration of the systematic and
yet economical development of such of
the natural resources of the country as
are still under the control of th" fed
eral government should be immediately
resumed and- affirmatively and con
structively dealt with at the earliest
possible moment. The pressing need
of such legislation is daily becoming
more obvious.
Warns Against Waste.
"The legislation proposed !. the last
session with regard to regui .ted com
binations among ourexportc. in order
to provide for our foreign ti.-.Je a more
effective organization and method of
cooperation, ought by all .eans to be
completed at this session.
"And I beg that th? mi mbers of the
House of Representative* will permit
me to express the opinioa that it will
be impossible to deal in any way but
a very wasteful and extravagant fash
ion with the enormous appropriations
of the public moneys which must con
tinue to be made if the war is to be
properly sustained, unless the House
will consent to its former practice of
initiating and preparing all appropria
tion bills through a single committee
in order that responsibility may be cen
tered, expenditures standardized and
made uniform and waste by duplication
be avoided as much as possible.
"Additional legislation may also be
come necessary before the present con
gress adjourns in order to affect the
most efficient co-ordination and opera
tion of the railway and other transpor
tation systems of the country. But to
that I shall, if circumstances demand
call the attention of congress upon an
other occasion.
Devote Session to War.
"If I have overlooked anything that
ought to be done for the more effective
conduct of the war, your own counsels'
will supply the omission. What I am
perfectly clear, about is that in the
j. present session of the congress our
whole attention and energy should be
concentrated on the vigorous and rapid
and successful prosecution of the great
task of winning the war.
"We can do this with all the greater
zeal and enthusiasm because we know
that for us this is a war of high prin
ciple, debased by no selfish ambition
of conquest or spoliation because we
know, and-aJ-.the world knows, that we
havo been forced into it to save the
very institutions we. live under from
corruption and destruction. The pur
poses of the central powers strike
straight at thfc very heart of everything
we believe in their methods of war

manity and of knightly honor their

Mobilization of Batiks.
From the B&che Review.
The mobilization of the banking toroes
of the country into the federal reserve
system Is going on*. From October 1 the
number of state banks and trust com
panies which have joined the federal re
servo system is approximately 40, repre
senting combined capital and deposits of
about $1,843,000,000. On November 1 there
were 50 applications for membership by
state banks and trust companies in the
hands of the federal reserve agents In
the several districts, and the boards of
directors of 33 state banks and trust com
panies passed resolutions authorizing ap
plication.
It is fair to assume that this Increase
will continue as a war measure, if for no
other reason, until practically the wlhole
banking force of the United States is In
cluded in the federal system—a consum
mation which would make it the most im
pregnable fortress for national financial
defense ever erected since the- beginning
of civilization. ......
Crusoe's Reljcs.
A biography written in the early part
of the last century by Dr. A. W. Davis,
of Tenttury, Eng., tells of the good doc
tor's visit to Largo in Fifeshire where
he saw a chest that once belonged to
Alexander Selkirk. This Selkirk was
none other than Robinson Crusoe, and
the chest was that which had been
with the redoubtable adventurer on'the
island of Juan Fernandez. It was an
heirloom that had been handed down
in the family and was then in the pos
session of a poor woman, also named
Selkirk. She had a drinking cup that
had belonged to her distinguished an
cestor, made of cocoanut shell and
tipped with silver.
Dr. Davis was convinced that both
relics were genuine. The chest was of
a kind commonly used by seamen and
had "A. S." cut into the lid at several
places. This same woman also had
owned a musket of Selkirk's, but she
gave it to the laird of the parish. Dr.
Davis notes that, visitors were permit
ted to see the weapon upon request.
Valuable Stuffing Evidently.
From Answers, London.
A certain millionaire presented to his
native city a flno collection of stuffed
birds and animals.
The attendant, escorting a visitor
through the silent halls, noticed that he
was yawning, and ventured to say:
"Perhaps you're not aware, sir. that
this is one of the richest taxidermist ex
hibits on eartll. Yes, sir, this collection
of stuffed animals and birds is wortti
£100,000!"
"Is that so?" said the visitor. "What
the dickens are they stuffed with?"
High prices for fuel have led to the
appointment of two committees in Peru
to report on the coal fields of the cen
tral and northern sections of that coun
try. If the investigations prove that coal
exists in considerable quantities rail
roads will be extended to reach the new
fields.

LONG USED BY AMERICA
Washington, D. C., Dec. 11.—In a
brief made public asking the supreme
court to dismiss cases attacking the
constitutionality of the selective draft
law, the government asserts that power
conferred upon congress to declare war
carries with it authority to compel mili
tary service either at home or abroad.
Compulsory draft is declared to have
been normal method of raising armies
ever since this government was estab
lished, the legality of which has been
repeatedly upheld by the courts. The
situation in Russia is pointed to, with
out mentioning the name, as a demon
stration that there can with safety be
no absolute freedom in civilized so

Havana, Dec. 10.—The belief was ex
pressed by several congressmen that
President Menocal will send a message
to congress asking that a declaration
be made that a state of war exists be
tween Cuba and Austria-Hungary.
Cuba was the first of the Latin
American countries to follow the United
States in declaring war against Ger
many and the expectation is that she
will duplicate this action in the case of
Austria-Hungary.

Washington, D. C„ Dec. 10.—Opera
tion by the navy of all American mer
chant ships traversing the war zone,

board, however, are trying to work out
an arrangement that will prove satis
factory to all interests concerned.

PREMIERTO RESTATE
ENGLAND'S WAR AIMS
Lloyd-George's Approval of Wil
son's Declaration Expected in
Commons Wednesday.
London, Dec. 11.—Lloyd-George will
respond to the recently Increasing pop
ular demand for a clearly definite and
up to date elucidation df war alms.
There is every reason to believe he
will make such a statement within the
next few days. It may come in the
house of commons Wednesday.
As exclusively told by United Press
dispatches more than 10 days ago, Col.
E. M. House, of the American mission,
urged on British, statesmen President
Wilson's view that there Should be a
frank and free pledging of war aims
by all of the allies as an impcrtant mili
tary measure. The Paris interallied
council considered this proposition at
its first session, but without action.
Recent plans made known to the
United Press today, however, would in
dicate that Lloyd-George's fieech may
be the first preliminary step toward
England's- formal approval of such
plans.
GRADUATION EXERCISES
kJJU.
•i%-,
S. BAYONET SCHOOL
American Headquarters in France,'
Dec. 10.—The "graduation exercises" of
the large bayonet school today were wit
nessed by several generals and their
staffs. The men, who had been trained
In the British system by British in
structors, gave a demonstration of en
ergy, speed and accuracy which was
truly American. They now are ready to
go over the top.
The scene of the graduation was in a
grassy valley, with high hills .walling
all the sides. A British sergeant major
in charge of the actual instruction, put
the men through bayonet drill so vig
orously that more than one man was
hurt. But their wounds were not ser
ious. One's hand was cut with the bay
onet and several were wounded in the
body and head, and the instructor him
self so narrowly escaped a bayonet
point in the hands of a charging young
American that his tunic was cut.
"Now then," the sergeant would say,
holding a heavy long stick in his hand,
"when 1 tell you men to turn, try to
get the point to me. Now, turn. Yea!
Yea! Give 'em hell. That's good!"
The Americans worked as if they
were players on a football fiold. The
sergeant, by reason of long practice,
was able to ward off some thrusts with
the point or butt, but from many he had
to jump out of the way.
Even more vigor was shown by the
men as they occupied the trench line
and, with their officers went over the
top in a charge, meeting the dummy
Germans on the way and finally occu
pying the enemy trenches, began by
firing from the trench at the dummies
in the enemy trenches. Some of the
men made perfect scores, while not
more than three out of the whole class
fell below 80 in a possible 100.
