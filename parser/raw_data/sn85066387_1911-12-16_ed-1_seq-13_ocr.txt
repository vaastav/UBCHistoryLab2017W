BRIBERY PUN
TOLD IN REDDING
City Marshal Says Witness
Was Offered Job for Life
on S. P. R. R.
- REDDING, Dec 15.—The state began
today the presentation of rebuttal evi
dence in the trial of Daniel Fleming,
charged with the - murd«r .of George
.Vallier. City Marshal Seng caused one
of the greatest sensations of the trial
when he asserted on the witness stand
that his recent appointment of addi
tional deputies, was due to information
that an attempt had been made by an
attorney for the defense and two
Southern Pacific detectives to bribe
Frank Hooper, an important witness
for the state. . . .
Marshal Seng asserted that W. W.
Reese, one of his deputies, hid in a
clothes bureau in Hooper's room wliile^
two other men secreted themselves on
an awning in front. These three men
reported to him that they heard, the
attorney and railroad detectives offer
• a round trip ticket to New York'and
a Southern .Pacific job for life to
Hooper if he would change his testi
mony. . ;„
According to .Marshal Seng the, ne
gotiations were not finished, hut a Bub
. sequent meeting was arranged. On the
date' set the attorney and detectives
did not appear. /
Interesting - developments are ex
pected as a result of this testimony.

You Have Teh Chances to
Hit the Bull's Eye: Shoot!
The More Shots You Take, the More Oppor
tunity to Ring the Bell
Suppose you were in a target fhooting competition, and the. rule«- ->f the
shoot said:
"Contestants may take as many U 10 shots at the bull's eye, if they
•wish."
. Would you take only one shot, and retire?
In the booklovers' Content you can take 10 shots at the Sttll'i rye. In
'•other words. yn U are permitted by the. rule- to make as many as 10 different
answers to each picture.
If you have an Answer Book, you need have only one copy of each ot
the 77 pictures, yet you can make as many as 10 answers to each picture.
Tf you do not have an Answer Rook, you must submit each answer you
make on a separate picture and coupon.
To-put this in another form:
If you have an Answer Book you will need only the 77 pictures no
matter whether you make one or two or ten answers to each picture.
If you do not have an Answer Book, you will need 77 pictures if you
make only one answer to each picture; you will need two times 77 pictures
if you make an average of two answers to each picture; you will need 10
times 77 pictures if you make 10 answers to each picture!
The Call devised the Answer Book to permit contestants to exercise
their ingenuity and common sense to the fullest in making answers to pic
tures, without requiring them to submit more than simply the full set <>f 77
pictures that appear from day to day in The Call.
The Answer Book is in shape something like a stenographer's notebook.
Tt opens from the bottom, you see, like a notebook, not from the side, like a
story book. Each top page of the Answer Book contains the space where the
proper picture is to be pasted. The top pages are numbered from 1 to 77,
inclusive. Each bottom page contains 10 spaces, where answers to the pic
ture above are to be made. You can make one or three or >ix or seven pr
ten answers to each picture, just as you wish.
Being able to submit several titles as answers to each of the pictures
enables you to increase vastly your chances of getting the correct answer,
which the picture was drawn to represent.
Answer Book* cost $1. or $1.10 by mail. An order form for Answer
Books is. printed in the announcement with today's contest picture. *
And do you want to enter the contest now? You can get the first 35
pictures FREE by purchasing a contest catalogue. This catalogue is a list
of 4,500 book titles. It costs 35 cents, 40 cents by mail. From this official
list of book titles the 77 titles represented by the 77 pictures are selected,
and then the pictures are drawn to represent these titles. Thus the 77 correct
titles are in the catalogue.
With each catalogue, remember, the first 35 contest pictures are given
free. An order form for securing catalogues is printed in the announcement
with today's contest picture.
* ANSWERS TO QUERIES
Contestants may submit the same title as an answer to more than one
picture, if they wish. But, of course, each picture represents a different title.
The catalogue used in this contest is not the same as the one used in the
first contest. Far from it! '
Picture No. 20 is NOT a misprint. It appeared in The Call just as it was
drawn to appear. # .
Answer Books will not be returned after close ot contest, no matter
whether contestants send stamps for their return or call for them. This
would entail an enormous and needless amount of work on the part of the
contest department.
Full details as to how to send in your answers will be printed toward
the end of the contest. •
Contestants submitting Answer Books will not receive any preference
over those simply submitting pictures when the matter of checking up the
correct answers is attended to. It is easier to submit neat pictures when
the Answer Book is used, of course.
The free certificates are redeemable just as you receive them. They do
not have to be written on by you or stamped by The Call.
Paste the picture only in your Answer 800k —not the coupon. If you
will read the directions on the Answer Book pages you will see how to do
it. The bottom pages of the Answer Books take the place of the regular
coupon*.
