you saloon men do have the right,
us you claim," said the Judge, "to
pul men out of door*, you have no

tliia atrotig language; "Joseph Mc
Kenna'a common reputation among
hia legal brethren, or among Ilia
judicial brethren, ha* not accorded
him a high place ; but, on the con*
trary, though many who eateemed
hint until now retrained from au
expression of opinion, the conseil
*u* of opinion haa been and ia that
be ia not, either by natural gift*,
acquired learning or decisiou of
character, qualified for any judicial
place of importance, much lese for
highest place in the land."
"We submit," declare these law
yers, whose opportunities for learn
ing both the character and attain
ments of McKentia have been of the
first class, "that, rather than dilute
the high quality of the Supreme
Court, it would be better to select
some one not from the PucificCoaat ;
but we believe there is abundance oi
material on this coast from which
to make a selection."
The. Oregon protest ia not an
abusive document. It is calm, judi
cial and patriotic in tone. It even
offers to surrender the representa
tion which the Pacific Coast has
had in the Supreme Court siuce the
days of Lincoln rather than see that
representation lowered in standard.
This is a sacrifice which would be
volunteered ouiy for reusuus that

The President's message to Con
gress is a voluminous document
and cautiously worded so as not to
offend either Spain or Mark Hanna.
He dwells at length on the currency
question and refers briefly to the
mission of Senator Wolcott and
iiis associates to Europe and does
not like to admit that it was a fail
ure.
The message refers to what Cleve
land called the "endless chain"
method of getting gold out of the
Treasury by redeeming greenbacks
and Treasury notes in gold every
time they were issued, and he also
recommends Cleveland's remedy
that when gold is paid out for
greenbacks the greenbacks should
be kept in the Treasury, to be paid
out for gold only. This and the
recommendation of Secretary Gage
that national banks be permitted
to iseue notes to the full par value
of the bonds which they have de
posited with the Treasurer and that
the tax oil bank notes be reduced,

A dispatch from Walerbury, Con
necticut, Dec. 6th, says: Robert
Hansel was dying here to-day of
typhoid fever. He was destitute
and it was not known that he had
friends until a telegram was received
irotn his uncle, Thomas Taggart,
mayor of Indianapolis, ordering
that everything possible be done for
him. This was addressed to City
Clerk Grudy. At about the same
time a telegram came from Decatur.
111., saying another uncle had died
there leaving the young uiau a for
tune.
Hansel came hers two months
ago with a young wife. He was a
canvasser and represented a New
Haven House. His means were ex
hausted soon after be was taken
sick and lie was unable to procure
medical attendance.
His wife remained at his bedside.
She knew her husband came of a
wealthy and prominent Ohio family,
but seemed disinclined to diveuss
his affair*. It is surmised that he
was alienated from his family by
the marriage, inasmuch as frequent
appeals for assistance to the mother
of the young mau met with no re
sponse.
Mark Twain, who is sojourning
Vienna, happened to be present

stealing a horse~-but even that was
a mild scene compared to the pro
ceedings of the Parliament. Mark
says he wae struck with a Czech.
