NOTE OF WARNING
,
It Is Sounded by President
Taft In His Message.
Directed Against European Dis
crimination Against America.
DEVOTED TOJOREIGN AFFAIRS
Points With Pride to Work of
His Administration.
Its Diplomacy One of "Dollars
ts. Bullets," He Says.
Washington, Dec 3. A note of warn
ing to European powers which by in
direct means continue to discriminate
against American trade; a strong ap
peal to the congress to uplift the great
foreign policies of America above mere
questions of partisanship: a trium
phant vindication of the diplomacy of
the administration, which is charac
terized as that of "dollars versus bul
lets;" a masterful pride in the enor
mous expansion of American trade as
a result of the foreign policies of hia
administration; and an earnest appeal
for joint action by congress and the
executive to open new markets for
American industries these are the
more striking features of President
Taft's fourth annual message sent to
congress today.
The message is the first of a series
of such communications which he will
mak to eonerress in the early days of
the session, and deals entirely with the
foreign relations of the United States.
Beginning with the usual reference tc
the existing good relations with for
eign powers, the president adds that
these have been strengthened- by "a
'greater insistence upon Justice to
American citizens, or interests, wher
ever it may have been denied, and a
stronger emphasis of the need of
mutuality in commercial and other re
lations" For the first time in its history says
the president the state department has
obtained substantially the most favor
ed nation treatment from all of the
countries of the world. Therefore, he
says that it is only natural that com
petitive countries should view with
some concern the expansion of our
commerce. Hence the warning, "If
in some instances, the measures taken
by them to meet it are not entirely
equitable, a remedy should be found."
Recommends Knox Bill.
To this end, the president strongly
recommends the enactment of the bill
recommended by Secretary Knox last
December, permitting the government,
Instead of imposing the full maximum
rates of duty against discriminating
countries, to apply a. graduated scale
of duties, up to that maximum of 25
per cent.
"Flat tariffs are out of date." says the
president. "Nations no longer accord
equal tariff treatment to all other na
tions, irrespective of the treatment
from them received It is very
necessary that the American govern
ment should be equipped with weapons
of negotiation and adapted to modern
economic conditions."
The state department, "an archaic
and inadequate machine,"' at the begin
ning of this administration, the presi
dent says, has become a new organiza
tion, with highly specialized bureaus
and experts dealing with every phase
of American trade and diplomacy.
Holding that the essence of this reor
ganized service is found in the merit
system, which President Cleveland is
credited with having introduced. Presi
dent Taft makes a strong appeal to
congress to make this machine perma
nent, by giving the force of statutory
law to the executive orders governing
admission to and promotion in the
diplomatic and consular services.
To show that these appointments are
already largely non-partisan, the presi
dent points to the fact that three of
the present ambassadors are hold
overs; that of the ten he has appointed,
five were by promotion from the rank
of minister; that of the thirty ministers
appointed, eleven were promotions, and
that in the consular service no less than
F5 per cent of the consuls appointed by
him were from the southern states.
Dollars Instead of Bullets.
"The diplomacy of the present admin
istration has sought to respond to mod
ern Ideas of commercial intercourse,"
avs President Taft. "This policy has
been characterized as substituting dol-I
lars for bullets, it is one mat appeals
Tllce to idealistic humanitarian senti
ments, to the dictates of sound policy
and strategy, and to legitimate com
mercial aims."
The president adds that "because
modern diplomacy is commercial, there
has been a dispisition in some quarters
to attribute to it none but materialistic
aims." , .
"How strikingly erroneous is such an
impression, may be seen from a study
of the results by which the diplomacy
of the United States can be judged."
SaHe mentions arbitration treaties
with France and Great Britain, which
failed of confirmation in the senate;
the successful tripartite mediation of
the Argentine Republic. Brazil, and
the United States, between Peru and
Ecuador; the arbitration of the Panama-Costa
Rica boundary dispute the
intervention between Haiti and the
Dominican Republic on the verge of
war the suppression of the Nicaraguan
war! the halting of intemaecine strife
in Honduras, the adjustment of the
celebrated Taona-Arioa dispute be
tween Peru and Chile, and the adjust
ment of the Peruvian-Ecuadorian
boundary issue. '
In consequence of these things, says
the president, there has been a general
easing of international tension on the
west coast of South America. He also
dds that the diplomacy of the United
tates is active in seeking to assuage
the remaining ill feeling between this
ountry and Colombia.
The Year's Work
Taking up some of the details of the
years diplomatic work, the president
refers with expressions of pride to
China, where, "the policy of encourag
ing financial investment to enable that
country to help itself has had the re
sult of giving new life and practical
TUESDAY &VENTVG.
application to the open-door policy."
The consistent purpose has been to
encourage the use of American capital
in China says the president, to pro
mote the reforms to which that country
is pledged by treaty with the United
States and other powers. There has
been a vigorous assertion, also, he says,
of the equal right of the United State
to a voice in all questions pertaining
to Chinese loans and developments.
President Taft makes the direct
charge that the terrible events record
ed in Nicaragua recently, the useless
loss of life, the devastation of proper
ty, the bombardment of the principal
cities, the killings and the tortures and
suffering, "might have been averted

approval of the loan convention by the
cuaie. Deen permitted to carry out
its now well developed policv.
"In Central America the aim has been
to help such countries as Nicaragua
and Honduras to helD themselves."
says President Taft.
While they are the immediate henpfl-
ciaries, the profit to the United States
is two-fold, he adds. The Monroe Doc
trine is more vital in the neiehborhood
of the Panama canal, and such coun
tries should be relieved of the jeopardy
of heavy foreign debts likely to pro
voke international complications.
.1 tie financial rehabilitation of these
countries by American bankers and the
protection of their customs houses from
Deing the prey of would-be dictators,
says the president, would remove the
menace of foreign creditors and revolu
tionary disorder. Furthermore, the
United States would profit largely In a
Diisiness way through the development
of the great natural resources of Cen
tral America.
The Xew Neutrality Laws.
Commending the successful results of
the application of the new neutrality
laws to Mexico and other troubled
countries, the president suggests that
means be found in addition to prevent
the professional revolutionists from
making American ports "loci" for
revolutionary intrigue. He reiterates
his determination to adhere in the
case of Mexico to the "patient policy
of non-intervention, steadfast recogni
tion of constituted authority, and the
exertion of every effort to protect
American interests."
Other paragraphs of the message
point to the increase of American do
mestic exports by $200,000,000 during
the past "year, making the greatest to
tal ever known, $Z, 200,000, 000; to
the agricultural credit system which
he thoroughly endorsed; to the prob
able necessity of an amendment of the
fur seal act to permit limiting killing of.
seals; to a meeting of the arbitrators
in Washington next year to adjust
the pecuniary claims between Great
Britain and America; to negotiations
with Mexico for the distribution of
the waters of the Colorado river in
the Imperial Valley section; and to
the financail rehabilitation of Liberia.
There is merely historical reference
to the Chinese revolution; to the San
Domingan troubles, the rebellion in
Cuba and the Balkan war develop
ments. In which it is said the United
States is not involved.
The message concludes with an ear
nest appeal to congress to co-operate
with the executive in its efforts to ap
ply the old principles of diplomacy
which have governed the country, to
the momentous new situations of to
day, when America finds itself at the
threshold of her middle age as a na
tion: "too mature to continue in its
foreign relations those temporary ex
pedients natural to a people to whom
domestic affairs are the sole concern."
ALWAYSJSLAND
Court Decides Riyer Tracts Are
Open for Settlement.
Valuable Land Involved Con
sisted of 200 Acres.
Great Bend, Kan., Dec. 3. Once an
island, always an island. This is the
decision of the district court here in
the case of Steckel against Vancil in
which the question of whether an is
land which grew toward the bank of
the Arkansas river until it became
part of the bank was school land came
up. The decision was that this land
was open to settlement.
The bed of the river, according to the
decision belongs to the state. The
riparian owner owns only to the high
water mark on the river bank. All
islands growing in the river are the
property of the state and subject to
settlement. If the island grows until
it reaches the bank the tract still be
longs to the state and is open for set
tlement. If, instead, the bank of the river
grows out into the channel such accre
tion belongs to the land owner. Where
the shore line grows to an island the
line where these meet separates the
state's tract from the privately ownec
land.
The tract involved consisted of near
ly 200 acres.
SNEED IS ACQUITTED.

PEACE JSJALTED
Adrianople Is a Stumbling
Block to the Negotiations.
The Sultan Is Firm in Inten
tion to Hold It,
GREECE IS STANDING OUT
May Be Allowed to Carry OD
the War Alone.
The Big Powers Continue
Nervous Over the Situation.
Sofia, Dec. 3. As armistice will be
signed today at Baghtche on the lines
of Tchatalja with or without Greece
being a party to it, according to in
formation obtained from authoritative
quarters here. Greece will be left to
continue the war alone against Tur
key, if she so desires.
Greeks Are Annoyed.
Athens, Dec. 3. Surprise and an
noyance are expressed by the Greek
newspapers at what they term the
"complaisance shown by Bulgaria in
accepting the Turkish proposals which
are so advantageous to the Ottoman
empire."
It is contended by many writers
that the complete and definite libera
tion of the Christians in the Orient is
obtainable only by combined land and
sea action of the allies against Con
stantinople. Adrianople a Stumbling Block.
London, Dec. 3. Adrianople was
the obstacle which threatened to
wreck the parleys between the pleni
potentiaries of Turkey and the Balkan
allies when they first opened at
Baghtche, and Adrianople appeared
again at the end of the negotiations as
the most serious hindrance to the at
tainment of an agreement.
At the first session the Turks abso
lutely refused to surrender Adrianople
but when the Bulgarians finally, yield-
ed to them on this point the Greek
delegates shrank back, and demanded
time in wnicn to suDmit tne question
to the government at Athens.
The reason for the Greeks' objec
tions to such submission is not far
to seek, according to diplomats. It
is pointed out that it is obvious that
if the Bulgarians sacrifice the ulti
mate position of Adrianople in the
interests of general peace they will
expect their allies to share their sac
rifice, and the only way in which this
can be done is to give Bulgaria
compensation in the shape of territory
conquered by the Greeks, Servians
and Montenegrins and which they
staked out for themselves. Hence the
wail from Athens" that any conces-
sessions to Turkey will "endanger the
fruits of victory gained by the allies
above all, those of Greece and
Servia."
Greece, apparently fears that in
case Turkey ultimately retains her
northern fortress, Bulgaria will more
actively dispute the Hellenic claims
to the possession of Salonlki. The
firm attitude of Turkey on the sub
ject of Adrianople throughout the ne
gotiations is shown in a telegram
from the sultan to King Ferdinand to
the effect that while he is prompted
by the most peaceful motives, he is
unabla to renounce Turkey's hold on
Adrianople, which all Ottomans con
sider as a Mohammedan sanctuary.
Diplomats in all the European coun
tries are anxious to see the real peace
negotiations begun, as they consider
there will then be a better chance of
reaching a settlement of the Austria
Servian dispute, which is still worry
ing the nerves of Europe.
CAN BUY ELSEWHERE.
Russia Ready to Declare Independ
ence Regarding Uncle Sam.
St. Petersburg, Dec. 3. It is official
ly announced today that the Russian
eovernment will publish January 1,
the day of the expiration of the
Russo-American treaty of commerce
and navigation, a statement outlining
its future - commercial policy toward
the United States and also a pro
visional tariff which will not contain
any great increase over the existing
tariff.
The policy of the Russian govern
ment, it is said, will not be imbued
by any spirit of animosity, but will
be directed solely to the protection
of the Russian markets and to assur
ing to the Russian consumer the most
favorable conditions of supply of the
staple imports hitherto coming direct
from the United States namely, cot
t n, farm machinery and implements.
The pressure exerted on Russia in
the matter of Jewish passports and
the resulting denunciation of the
Russo-American treaty aroused the
attention of the Russian government
to the necessity of protecting the in
terests of Russian consumers.
Russia, it is pointed out, now grows
more than half the cotton she con
sumes and in fifteen years she will in
this respect become self sufficing.
Should the United States attempt dis
criminating measures against Russian
products or shipping, it is argued here
that it would be well to remember that
Russia is able to seek cotton in Egypt
and India and machinery in England
and Australia.
Receives Double Pay.
Washington, Dec 3. The interstate
commerce commission held today that
the Chicago, Milwaukee & St. Paul
railway under existing conditions re
ceives double pay for the transfer of
grain, which is "manifestly unjust."
The road, it was shown, charged the
owner one-fourth of a cent a bushel
to elevate grain and received a like
sum from eastern railways for trans
ferring the same grain.

The Impeachment Trial
Judge Archbald Begins.
of
Indicted by the House on
Separate Charges.

ADMITS ALL ALLEGATIONS
But Defendant Denies That His
Acts Were Improper.
First Proceedings of Kind
Since the Swane Case.
Washington, Dec. 3. For the ninth
time in its history the senate convened
today as a high court of impeachment
to try Judge Robert W. Archbald, of
the Commerce court, on thirteen separ
ate charges alleged to constitute "high
crimes and misdemeanors."
Council for the judge admitted com
mission of all the acts alleged, but de
nied that any was improper.
The house will be represented
throughout the hearing by seven man
agers, who act as the prosecutors in
the trial. They are Representatives
Clayton, of Alabama, Webb, of North
Carolina, Floyd, of Arkansas, Davis, of
West Virginia, Sterling, of Illinois,
Howland, of Ohio, and Norris, of Ne
braska. A. S. Worthington, of Washington,
with Alexander Simpson, jr., of Phila
delphia, . will represent Archbald
throughout the case.
The charges against Judge Archbald
arose in connection with private and
official acts, both as a judge of the
Court of Commerce and as United
States district judge for middle Penn
sylvania. He was impeached by the
house of representatives, after a full in
vestigation of the facts by the depart
ment of justice, and extended hearings
before the house Judiciary committee.
The managers appointed by the
house to prosecute the case before the
senate asked for an immediate trial
last August but the senate declined
to hasten its consideration of the case.
During the last week scores of sub
poenas were issued for witnesses who
will be brought before the senate by
the house managers and by Judge
Archbald's attorneys in connection
with the trial.
First Case Since 1904.
After the house committee on Ju
diciary had concluded its hearings last
spring it recommended that Judge
Archbald be called before the senate
under impeachment proceedings. The
last time the house had exercised its
imDeaehment powers was In 1904 when
Judge Swane, United States Judge for
the northern district of Florida, was
called to account for misconduct and
was acquitted by the senate. The
house of representatives on July 11,
1912, adopted articles of impeach
ment by a vote of 222 to. 1 and a
committee headed by Representative
Clavton of Alabama, was chosen to
act as the managers cn the part of the
house to try the case before the sen
ate. The house majafcers urged tne
senate to grant an iumediate trial but
that coay decline-i ti hear tne case
before the end of the last session.
Thirteen separate articles constitute
the basis for the impeachment trial.
These embrace dealings between Judge
Archbald and the railroad officials
and others in regard to Pennsylvania
coal or "culm" dumps and coal lands;
contributions by attorneys and others
to the Judge's vacation trip to Europe
in 1910: reputed "secret correspond
ence" bv the judge with a railroad at
torney concerning a pending case; and
alleged attempts to nave notes pay
able to Judge Archbald discounted by
attorneys and litigants before his
court.
In nresenting the case to the house
of representatives Clayton said that
the judiciary committee was or opinion
that Judge Archbald's "sense of mor
al responsibility had become deaden
ed" and that he had "prostituted his
high office for personal profit."
The Katydid Culm Deal.
The principal charge grew out of the
Katydid Culm bank deal. In this charge
it was asserted that while the Erie Rail
road company had pending before the
commerce court two suits. Judge Arcrv
bald, corruptly taking advantage of his
official position, induced the officials of
the Hillside Coal & Iron company and of
the Erie railroad which owned that com
pany, to agree to sell the coal com
pany's interest in the Katydid dump to
Judge Archbald and Edward J. Williams.
In his answer Judge Archbald dented
that he had acted corruptly, or had taken
advantage of his position. His attorneys
took the position that it was not a crime
for a federal judge to become interested"
in an attempt to purcnase property from
one who was or might become a litigant
bfore his court. They declared that no at
tempt was made to get the property for
less than its fair value.
Another prominent charge was that
Judge Archbald undertook for a consider
ation to assist George M. Watson, an at
torney of Scranton. Pa., to settle a repar
ation suit brought by the Marion Coal
company against the Delaware, Lacka
wanna & Western Railroad company, and
to sell for C. G. Boland and W. P. Bolan i.
a large portion of the stock of the Marion
Coal company to the railroad. In his an
swer Judge Archbald declared he acted in
this matter merely as a friend of Watson
and C. G. Boland, without ever having
received a suggestion of compensation.
In response to every charge attorneys
for Judge Archbald replied that the acts
charged did not constitute an impeachable
offense, or a high crime or misdemeanor,
as defined in the constitution.

Cameron Girl to Marry Cham
pion Tonight, He Says.
Moying Pictures to Be Taken
of Ceremony.
Chicago, Dec. 3. Jack Johnson, negro
pugilist, declared today that he plan
ned to marry, tonight, Lucile Cameron,
the 19-year-old Minneapolis girl, whose
mother, caused his arrest on serious
charges. The impending marriage will
not affect his case before the federal
court, according to Johnson's attorneys.
- To Marry for "Movies."
The prize fighter said a moving pic
ture concern had agreed to pay him
$5,000 to make a film of the wedding.
which is scheduled to take place at the
home of his aged mother on the South
Side. Johnson announced that he has
arranged with H. A. Roberts, a negro
preacher, to perform the ceremony. The
wedding will be attended by a few In.
timate friends and relatives, according
to Johnson.
"I had a long talk- with Miss Cameron
yesterday, and we decided to be mar
ried tonight," said Johnson. "I ex
plained that I had been blamed for ill
treating her, and that we might as well
be married right away.
"She is alone in the world now. Her
mother has left her and her step-father
is quoted as saying he wants to have
nothing more to do with her. We love
each other, and I see no reason why we
should not be married. We will spend
our honeymoon near Chicago, but will
not leave the state.''
Negro Gets License.
Johnson today procured a license to
wed Miss Lucile Cameron, the white
girl who has been identified with John
son's recent trouble in the federal
court. The wedding is set for tonight,
it was said.
Johnson first made his application to
L. C. Legner, clerk of the marriage
license office. Miss Cameron was not
with him and when the prize fighter
stated that she would not be 19 years
old until February, the clerk, follow
ing the rule of the office of not issu
ing a license unless the girl is present
to swear to her age, declined to issue
the permit. Johnson then appealed to
Robert M. Sweitzer, county clerk, who
overruled Legner and Johnson went
away grinning with the document safe
ly stowed in his pocket-
Crowd. Follows Black Fighter.
Johnson explained to the county
clerk that the records in court show
that the Cameron girl is over 18 years
of age. Johnson gave his own age as
34 years. A considerable crowd follow
ed the negro in and out of the build
ing and on his pilgrimage from one
office to the other.
When Chief of Police McWeeney was
informed that a moving picture con
cern had arranged to photograph the
wedding he declared if legal means
could be found he would not permit
public exhibition of the pictures.
"The whole affair is antagonistic to
public policy and morals generally,"
said Chief McWeeney.

is directed especially against nomina

postponed from time to time, thus
bringing the new terms close to the
beginning of the Democrat administration-Democratic
senators claim that the
president already has deprived the
Democrats of the privilege of appoint

within the civil service law by a sin

Democrats Will Sit on Sunny
Side of Legislate Halls.
Old Custom to Be Followed by
the Victors.
AFTER THE LEAN YEARS
WW Be Horde of Seekers After
Office.
Hodges Going to Texas ot
Believed Be Contest.
For the first time in many, many
years the Democrats will this winter
sit on the sunny side of the house and
senate. It is an old, old custom In
Kansas legislative organization that
the minority party draws the seats
nearest the North pole, while tha
majority party is awarded the nlca
warm upholstered chairs near the
south windows and the vent pipes.
And this winter the Democrats will
claim title to the warm seats.
Two years ago James W. Orr,
"Iron Jaw" W. L. Brown, and the 60
other Democratic members of tha
house were given the revolving chairs
Just as near the north windows aa
Speaker Buckman could place them.
Over on the south side the Republican
enjoyed the occasional sunshine and)
toasted their feet by the radiators.
But the Democrats didn't complain.
Perhaps they were glad to get seats
In the house under any conditions of
servitude and they made the most of
the situation.
In the senate the four lone Demo
crats were seated Just where they
would receive the benefits of the north,
winds tha filtered through the win
dows of the senate chamber. To be
sure there is only one of the olA
Democratic crop returned to the sen
ate, but he is re-enforced by 20 mora
Democrats. And every one of them
will claim homestead or squatter right
to the warmest of the 40 cushions.
Senator Milton of Wyandotte Is tha
only Democrat of the 1907-11 crop
who has been returned. But Milton'a
four years of former service has
taught him which is the warm and
which is the cold side of the hall and
he will be the bell wether to lead his
flock to a spot where their teeth will
not chatter when the thermometer hits
the toboggan. On the other hand
Price, Carey. Stillings, Stavely. Huff
man, Overfield and Denton must sur
render their old seats and take a
place where overcoats are welcome
company on a cold day.
That Is one of the joys of a change
In the administration. But that is not
all. . -
When the legislature is organized,
the Democrats by virtue of their ma
jority in both- houses, will control 90
per cent, of the patronage. In tha
senate they will probably appoint a
committee on committees to relieve
Lieutenant Governor Sheffield Ingalls
of the burden, of naming the ap
pointees. The committee on commit
tees will hardly neglect to give tha
Democrats the very best committee
appointments. A committee on em
ployees will not only inspect the cre
dentials of every applicant for
clerkship or candidate for assistant
superintendent of ventilation, but the
applicant may well deny himself un
due worry and trouble if he cannot
produce a record of arduous work and
faithful service for Kansas Democracy.
For it must be remembered that there
have been many lean years for Kansas
Democrats and the very best that the
state patronage affords in the coming
session will be none too great a re
ward for the party whose faith, hope
and patience have enabled them to
await the coming festivities.
Senator George H. Hodges, governor
elect, will go to Texas for a two weeks
vacation before beginning 'his pre
liminary work surrounding the taking
over of the governorship of the state.
It is probable that while in Texas.
Hodges will write his inaugural address.
But that will be the only official exer- '
else of the trip.
Almost since the day of election,
Hodges has been buried with applica
tions for positions. These applicants
have come In" person' and by proxy.
Those who were unable to visit Hodges
personally or to send a representative,
have flooded the Olathe man's mail with
requests for jobs. Almost every voting1
precinct in the state has furnished' on
or more candidates for positions.. At
least half of these applicants want good
places, jobs that pay well and not sur
rounded by the formality of too much
real labor. Other candidates have been
less discriminating. Many were willing
to take anything, apparently, that
might be offered or suggested. Their
desire seemed to hinge on the glory
and honor of receiving a monthly pay
check from the state, no matter how
small the pay.
It is this trouble of dividing ttt
patronage, it Is claimed, that is largely
responsible for Hodges seeking a hasty
vacation at this time and leaving no
forwarding address with the Olathe
postmaster. So far. there has been no
indication from Hodges as to the men
who may land the really good appoint
ments. But for each good Job there are
several willing and enthusiastic ap
plicants. However, it appears that
Hodges wfll leave the patronage ques
tion until the last minute.
Even though Capper might contest
Hodges' election and win the guberna
torial chair by virtue of a re-count of
the votes, there would be but little
honor or satisfaction In the victory. In
the few months that Hodges must
necessarily hold the Job, the legislative
session will be held. Backed by a Dem
ocratic majority in both houses, Hodges
would win and merit the credit for a
large portion of the legislation.
That is not all. One of Hodges' first
officials acts, according to his own
statement, will be to remove a number
of present state house appointees. Chief
among these is J. N. Dolley, state bank
commissioner. With the removal of
Dolley. would come changes In the of
fices of live stock commissioner, oil in
spector, the board of control, tax com
mission, utilities commission and
changes In many minor positions.
