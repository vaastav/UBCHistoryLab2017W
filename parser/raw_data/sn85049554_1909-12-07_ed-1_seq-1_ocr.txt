THRU SECRETARY OF TREASURY
PRESIDENT CALLS FOR
INSTEAD OF USUAL DEFICIT
Lack of Organization in Conducting
Government's Business Criticized by
Secretary MacVeagh—Reviews Probe
.. Into Customs Service and Resultant
Washington, Dec. 7.—Retrenchment
is the keynote in the estimates of ex
penditures for .the executive depart
ments of the government for the fis
cal year 1911, embodied in the an
oual report of Franklin MacVeagh as
secretary of the treasury, made pub
lic today. This is in line with Presi
dent Taft's declared policy of greater
economy dn administering the affairs
of the government.
"The total estimates for 1911 are
1684,132,197, including the naval build
ing -program. Excluding the increase
In the Panama canal estimates, the to
tal estimates for 1911 show a decrease
of $57,244,493.89 under the appropria
tions for 1910. Including the increase
in t£e Panama canal estimates, the, to
tal estimates for 1911vshow a decrease
of $42,818,969.19 under the appropri
ations for 1910. The ordinary esti
mated receipts for the current year are
$648,000,000 and for the ordinary dis
bursements at $682,075,620, leaving a
deficit in ordinary receipts of $34,075,
620. When the payments on account
of the Panama canal and the public
debt are added, the total deficit of the
fiscal year 1910 is estimated at $73,
075,620.12. The estimated ordinary
receipts for 1911 are $672,000,000, and
the estimated ordinary appropriations
$636,068,672.51, or a surplus in ordin
1,32*19.
ary receipts of $35,931,32^19. When the
•t
1
Panama canal estimates for 1911 arejvelns
added the surplus Is turned into a de
ficit of $12,132,197.21.
Secretary MacVeagh, emphasizing
the "hard rigidity of the present rev
enue system," -with its recurrent eco
nomical agitations and its long inter
vals of fixity," says it will be neces
sary to imeet these deficits to sell either
'bonds .or certificates of indebtedness.
"In- due course,"- he adds, "it Would,
seem that It must be made .practicable
to both estimate receipts, with a close
approximation to the actual, and to
provide for their annual rise or fall
by BQme flexible factors in our annual
taxation."
Improved Methods in Business.
"Reduvtions in the present estimates,
Mr. MacVeagh declares, result from
improved handling of the government
work and the postponement of expend
itures which can be delayed in an ef
fort to adjust immediate expenses and
receipts. He pounds a warning, how
ever, .that the reductions in appropria
tions will be disappointing unless equal
attention 4s given to other important
savings.
Secretary MacVeagh reviews the
organization, or rather lack of organi
zation, of the fiscal responsibilities of
the executive and legislative branches
of-the government and the reorganiza
tion thereof now in progress. He voices
the hope that there will be "constant
progress away from the extreme dis
organization of the past" and observes
that "even-if-our country is rich it can
not- afford to be wholly unscientific in
its appropriations."
(Probably the most important recom
mendation made by the secretary is
jthat the tax on bank circulation se
cured by- United States 'bonds here
after deposited bearing Interest higher
than 2 per cent shall be increased in
exact proportion to .the increase in the
rate of interest above 2 per cent. He
advises oontinuance of the rate of
one-half of per cent for circulation
based on 2 per, cent bonds. (Mr. Mac
Veagh says that if -the Panama bonds
authorized by the law of Aug. 5, 1909,
ehould be issued at 3 per cent, they
would have a much better circulation
privilege than the outstanding 2 per
cents, 'the tax being only 1 per cent.
Mr. MacVeagh would make the .tax
on them 1% per cent otherwise the al
ready low market value of the' 2 per
cents -would unduly decline.
Panama Canal Bonds.
At the same time, Mr. MacVeagh
says it is desirable to complete the
legislation respecting the new Panama
bonds to m£.ke them available so as to
begin the settlement of the indebted
ness to the general nind of the treas
ury of the Panama canal. He suggests
that if the sale of any of those bonds
should produce more cash than the
treasury balance needs, some of the
2 per cents might be bought in the
market for the slnklag fund, thus keep
fe Ing the market price, of the latter class
above par. Declaring that the jgovern
ment toas not, .and newer has had, a 2
per cent bortowing power, Mr. Mac-
Veagh saysit possibly would have
teen better never to have Issued 2 per
cent bonds or bonds at any rate below
the government's borrowing -power In
•the open market. He says that as a
Stasis for-circulation they have no
elasticity
that
they are practically all
•i^.,j..held by the banks as basis of clr
Circulation .and that the hanks -would
suffer so heavy a loss in an attempt to
dispose of th$ra -that the Influence of
_^the situation lis consequently decidedly
against the retirement of circulation.
The Issuance of 3 per cent bonds at
1% says Mr. MacVeagh, would hot
yohange in ,iny way the net interest re
mit of Us .transactions with, the banks.
Then again it .would provide bonds
-wJj'wMch investor? would want anid which
wonI4h^y« «, to road and wholesome dianapolia, disagreed,
if s?
market aiding materially In increasing
the elasticity of the currrency.
Reform in Customs Service.
Secretary .MacVeagh, discussing the
rehabilitation of the customs service in
progress as a result of the extensive
frauds discovered at the port of New
York says:
"It is ciear that the influence of local
politics and politicians upon the cus
toms service, has been most deleterious,
and has propm'^il that laxity and low
tone which prepare and furnish an in
viting soil for dishonesty and^fraud.
Unless the customs service can be re
leased from the payment of political
debts and exactions, it^will be impos
sible to have an honest service for any
length of time."
He says that the work of reorganiza
tion ii "not complete, not nekrly com
plete" but predicts that the necessary
prosecutions being made "will lead in
the end to the establishment of an ad
ministration of .the customs service
that is fit for .the government of a
great nation."
While purposely avoiding,* as he says,
expression of a preference for any par
ticular plan or system, Mr. MacVeagh
strongly urges the need of a retiring
pension for aged employes, stating that
the United States is the only nation
that has no general legal retiring pen
sion for the employes of its civil ser
vice.

DESPITE CRITICAL ILLNESS
Investigation Shows That State Insur­

Sums and That Phoenix Had Es­

I New York, Dec. 7.—The fact that
I George P. Sheldon is so ill at his home
In Connecticut that he Is expected to
die will not cause the abandonment of
the criminal investigation and prosecu
tion In matters of the Phoenix Insur
ance Company of Brooklyn, from the
presidency of which Sheldon was re
moved at the instigation of the state
insurance department.
The superintendent of the Insurance
department declared in his report that
the Phoenix Insurance Company, thru
its president, had been in the habit of
lending considerable sums to state in
surance officials, and that for twonty
two years the company has not been
investigated by the department. Four
state insurance officials are mentioned,
whose loans from the Phoenix aggre
gate 260,000.
Tlio insurance department believes
the company's risks to the public are
not involved and the. entire loss thru
the, loans negotiated by Sheldon can be
balanced by crossing off $1,000,000 of
the company's $3,000,000 surplus.

pany has lost a million of its $13,000,

Cherry, III., Dec. 7.—Officers are
scouring tho country for Alexander

cagers at the air shaft of the Cherry
mine, who aro wanted to testify be

origin of the fire that caused the death
of the 310 men who lost their lives In
the catastrophe of Nov. 13.
the St. Paul Coal Company, who re
fusetj to divulge the secrets of tho com
pany's affairs. Ruck's fate Is said to
depend largely upon the success o£ tha
search for Kosenjack and Dean, who.
It. Is hinted, were assisted In leaving
Cherry to keep them out of reach of
the coroner's Jury.
Several of the miners who cscaped
from th( burning mine and the wives
of miners who were at tho mine top
•on the fatal day gave evidence at tho
Inijuest.
Mrs. Gemlma Miller, who rushed to
the mine top about 2:30 when sh«
heard of the fire, testified that they
were still hoisting coal at that tlmo.
She asked them why they did not hoist
tho men Instead of the coal, and Ruck
told her. she asserts, that ho didn't'
think the fire would amount to any
thing. but If It did they would start
hoisting the men.
•Dr. L. O. Howe, the mine physician,
who was a member of the rescue party
and made seven trips Into the burning
mine In an effort to save the miners,
and who was also one of the men who
entreated the engineer to raise tho
eago containing the rescue party, gave
a graphic uescripiiun or the rascuo
work. His version of the engine-room
Incident Is contradictory to that of
John Cowley, the engineer. When
he asked him to raise the cage, said
Dr.'Howe, he refused to do it and mut
tered and grumbled until he had talk
ed with the machinist and others.
When he finally did raise it he pulled
away at a snail's pace, the physician
said. The cage with the rescuers, he
thought, muat have been at the bot
tom ten or twelve minutes.
The testimony of George Jones, a
'carpenter at the mine, revealed another
condition for which the ooal company
is being censured. A number of eom
pany and diggers were employed 4n
the mine at night, said Jones, but dur
ing a part of that tlmo only one engin
eer was on duty. The engine for the
main KHaft is in another building from
that In which the engine for the air
shaft is locatedj arid the throttles are
about fifty feet apart. FVom 4:30 to
8:80. p. m., he Mid, there was only one
engineer, and again from IS: SO to 6:M.
The significance of this llee hi the /act
-that one engine ran the noiat from the
third vein, while the other ran that
from the second vein.
