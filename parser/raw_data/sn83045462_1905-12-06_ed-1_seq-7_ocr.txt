VIEWS ON MESSAGE
Friendly Comment and Hos
tile Criticism by Editors.
LENGTH OF THE PAPER
PATRIOTIC IN TONE AND CHAR
ACTERISTIC IN PHRASE.
Objection to the Zeal of the President
for Centralization?Not a Cold
Chronicle of Events.
From the New York Tribune.
The supreme emphasis of the President's
message Is placed, as was expected, on the
relations of the government to corporations.
Various phases of this subject are dlscusssd
at great length and with many character
istic expressions of sociological and moral
convictions. From the point of view of
those- who seek In a message merely a
chronicle of progress and an outline of
specific measures this seems academic and
superfluous. President Roosevelt, however,
is not making merely conventional recom
mendations.
Sincere and Earnest.
From the Philadelphia Ledger.
The President had so many subjects on
which he wished to express his views at
length that he was not able?even by omit
ting the usual detailed information?to bring
his annual message within such compass
that the busy man may easily read It. Like
all that Mr. Roosevelt writes, the message
bears the impress of his personal sincerity
and earnestness, but it might have been
made more effective by condensation.
Centralization.
From tlie New York World.
"This government is not and never shall
be government by plutocracy," says Pres
ident Roosevelt In his message to Congress.
"This government is not and never shall be
government by a mob." Fine words, but
they butter no parsnips.
Mr. Roosevelt has submitted to Congress
the most amazing program of centraliza
tion that any President of the United
States has ever recommended.
Stands Pat on Rates.
From the New York Sun.
Mr. Roosevelt's first annual message as
an elected President of the United States
went to Congress yesterday. It Is a very
protracted document. It might have been
shorter, but it could not have been more
painstaking in exposition, more character
istic In phraseology or more patriotic both
in intent and in tone. At the front is the
question supposed to be foremost in the
President's mind at the present time.
Would Regulate Everything.
From the New York Herald.
The art committee of a nearby county
fair offered not long ago a premium of
$10 for "?the largest and heaviest oil
painting owned in the county." Measur
ing art by tilt foot rule or on the scales
may not be aesthetic, but if the fair com
mittee had made It presidential messages
instead of canvases Mr. Roosevelt's 23,000
word document submitted yesterday to Con
gress would have taken the prize without
doubt. Compared in size with the massages
of his predecessors it makes them look like
the Declaration of Independence engraved
on a 'three-cent piece. Centralization of
power In Washington, federal control of
pretty nearly everything and everybody is
the dominant tone of the President's views,
and which he urges Congress to back up
and make possible by federal laws.
Pieachment.
From the New York Times.
The Congress has never before been
so preached to by any President as by
Mr. Roosevelt in the message sent to the
Capitol yesterday. It Is a sermon exposi
tory of the rules of human conduct. It is
unsha.ka.bly founded upon the changeless
principle that right Is different from wrong
It is solidly- built up with granite blocks
of ethical precept. It bristles with moral
maxims, which only men whose hearts have
been steeped in turpitude would have the
hardihood to dispute. The senators and
members who listened to the reading of It
must have risen from their task wearier
but better men. Mr. Roosevelt's passion
for utterance and his obedient and practiced
pen spun the document out to the doubtless
unprecedented length of 28,000 words. It
Is a book in itself. The great length of the
message is due to Mr. Roosevelt's haoit of
composition.
The Navy.
From the Philadelphia Inquirer.
President Roosevelt, through his numer
ous addresses, has kept the public so well
Informed concerning his views upon na
tional questions that It is probable that
most intelligent citizens could have given
in advance a fairly good synopsis of his
message to Congress. In fact, it contains
nothing that is particularly new unless hta
attitude toward the navy can be so con
strued.
Informing.
From the Baltimore Sun.
The President's message deals -with a
large variety of subjects, some of which
are treated with apparently unnecessary
elaboration. Nevertheless, it is an inform
ing document.
A Message to the People.
From the New York Mail.
The President's message is first and fore
most an earnest brief for government rate
making; secondly, a preachment. In the
best sense of the word, of democratic equal
ity and forbearance on the text "Taken as I
a whole we must all go up or go down to
gether;" thirdly, a veritable arsenal of spe
cific suggestions as to those matters, In
cluding the tariff, in which the executive
interest Is real, but not quite as great as
in the railroad question. Above all. the
document may be regarded as a message
to the people, in which Mr. Roosevelt fully
recognizes the responsibility of his Influence
as a leader of public opinion.
Too Long.
From the New Yolk Evening Post.
The greatest possible defect of a book,
declared the Port Royal logicians. Is not
to be read. The same is true of presidential
messages, and Mr. Roosevelt has made his
of such inordinate length that it will be
little read.
FALCONIO SURPRISED.
Found Long Lost Nephew at Function
in Pittsbure.
Special Dispatch to The Star.
PITTSBURG, Pa., December 0.?Mgr.
Falconlo. apostolic delegate and head of
the Catholic Church in America, found hero^
Monday night his prodigal nephew, Dan
Fnlconlo of McKcc's Rocks, Pa. The meet
ing took place In an ante-room In the Con
servatory of Music, where a reception was
in progress for the noted prelate.
The few persons who witnessed the scene
will never forget it. Mgr. Falconlo fell
upon his nephew's shoulders, weeping, and
fervently kissed him many times on both
checks, while the young man tried In vain
to kiss the episcopal ring. After this in
terchange of passionate Italian greetings
was over the archbishop besought and ob
tained from his nephew a promise to go
home to his aged mother in Italy.
She has been writing to Mgr. FakoclO
for years asking about her boy, but the
apostolic delegate could not locate bint.
Falconlo left Italy at the ago of fourteen,
and for five years has been in business for
himself in Pittsburg. As an evidence of
his good faith he promised his uncle he
would call on him In Washington on tla
way back to Italy.
