WEDNESDAY, DECEMBER 6, 18S8.
THE PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE.
If President CleveUnd't message of
a year ago was confined tJ the one
subject of tariff reform, ttie document
Rent to the Congress on Monday fully
makes up for the subjects then omitted.
The "stale of the Union" is pretty
thoroughly discussed, and if any point
of interest of the affairs of the nation
is omitted, unless it be the Civil Ser
vice refurm, we fail to detect it. In
stead of being the message of Presi
dent about to retire from public life
one whose policy has been repudiated
by the people it reads like a docu
ment of a roan with the greater part
of a term yet to serve, aod who lays
out an elaborate programme of reform.
It might pertinently be asked, why
did not the Democratic party, when
io power, accomplish some of these re
forms, or at least make attempts which
would command the confidence of the
people?
The protective tariff receives a great
deal of atteLlion. Whilo Grover
Cleveland as a candidate for re elec
tion was "no free-trader," as a man
about to retire from public life his
free trade sentiments are very clearly
expressed.
lie attacks the protective system as
a violation of the Constitution 'the
compact between the Government and
the people, and predicts that all class
es of society will rise to destroy it
He talks glibly of equal rights of cit
izenship ; of poverty and wealth ; of
the fortunes of manufacturers being
exacted from the masses of the people;
nbout trusts, combinations, and mo
nopolies ; of the broken bond of the
Government with the people; and,
letting his feelings outrun bis judg
ment, be says:
Communism is a hateful thing, and
a menace to peace and organized gov
ernment; but the communism of com
bined wealth and capital, the out
growth of overweening cupidity and
selfishness, which insidiously uuder-
mines the justice and integrity of free
institutions, is not less dangerous than
the coiumunisru of oppteesed poverty
and toil, which, exasperated by injus
tice and discontent, attacks with wild
disorder the citadel of rule.
The President detects a tendency to
extend the federal power into the do
main of State and local jurisdiction,
says it must be checked, and passes on
to quoto with approval and presuma
bly to apply to himself Andrew Jack
son's declaration : "The ambition
which leads me on is an anxious de
sire and a fixed determination to re'
store to the people, unimpaired, the
sacred trust they have confided to my
charge," etc.
Mr. Cleveland then mentions the
constitutional provision requiring the
President to give to Congress informa
tion as to the state of the Union, and
proceeds to tell what has happened
since his last annual message, and to
review the international questions set
tled and unsettled. He mentions the
rejection of the Fisheries treaty by
the Senate, and then says that do case
of unlawful treatment of American
vessels by Canada has been reported
since March 3, 1887, in which repara
tion was not promptly obtained from
the Dominion Government, thus con
fessing that his demaud for extraordi
nary retaliation powers was a piece of
buncombe. The Sackville matter is
mentioned, and the correspondence in
the case is promised.
He has tried to prevent the exter
mination of the fur seals, to fix the
boundary between Alaska and British
Columbia, protect American citizens of
foreign birth from military service
when vifaiting home, and to duly coo
dole with Germaov on the death of
the two Emperors.
The history of the rise and fall of
civil service reform, which, if written
as exhaustively as other subjects dis
cussed, would have used several tbous
and words more, is not given in the
message.
The selection of Governor Beaver
for Marshal of the Inauguration Day
parade iu Washington assures a skill
ful handling of the great number of
organized bodies that will be iu line
on that occasion. Governor Beaver
will hriog to the work the experience
of the soldier ; he is a strict disciplin
arian, and so far as be is concerned
there will be no delay iu the prompt
movement of tbe line. It is already
estimated that tbe number participat
iiig will be larger by one half than
ever before, and no ono could be found
better equipped in all respects to man
age tbe affair than Goveruor Beaver.
It is probable that as a matter of per
sonal fstiofdctiuu he would prefer to
ride at the bead of the National
Guard of tbe State, but he will doubt
less accept the appointment which has
ben leudered Liu), and he can take
the Pennsylvania troops along for
tatJ" aud escort duly. The new mili
tary company of this plnce is hustling
to be accepted aod mustered into ser
vice in time to go to tbe inauguration
with the Pennsylvania National Guard.
Forest County comes to the front
with a claim that it is entitled to tbe
second prize banner offered by Chair
man Cooper fur an incrcaso over the
Blaine vote of 14, Sullivan coming
first. The fact is that all the interior
counties of the State did so well that
it is going to be prelly difficult to dis
criminate in the distribution of the
burners, but Forest is entitled to one,
at all events. Philadelphia Press.
Tug oflic al vote in Pennsylvania,
at (he lato election, as attested by the
secretary of the commonwealth, was
hs follows: Republican, 526,091 ; Dem
ocratic, 44B.G33 ; Prohibition, 20.947 ;
Labor, 3,873; American, 24. This
gives lLinison a plurality of 79,438
and a majority over all of 54,614. It
is safe to settle bets on these figures.
But the fellow who bet that llarrisou's
msjority would be larger or as large
as Blaine's has won, fur Blaine's mat
jority over all was 48,280, while his
plurality was 81,019

The lectures by Mr. Miller on "The

heartily received by our Chautauqua

critical as any in the laud. Chautau
