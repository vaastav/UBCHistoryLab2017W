not to loiter longer on the way, but
to keep a moving, "do" the country,
and reach New Orleans without de
lay, bo as to embark on his journey

Secretakt Boctwell has given
notice calling in the outstanding
five-twenties of the second series is
sued under the act of February 25th
1862. Interest will cease on the 7th
of March, 1871, and principal and
accrued interest will be payable at
the Treasury Department on and
after that date. The bonds thus
called in amount to $20,000,000.
The Governor of Virginia pays a
high tribute to Republicanism when
he acknowledges that universal suf
frage and equality before the law
has proved conducive to good in that
state, making it behind none of its
sister states in good order and obedi
ence to law. He also enlogizes the
free school system and declares it
successful beyond the warments ex
pectation of its friends.
The Georgia Legislature has
passed a law over acting Governor
Conley's veto, calling an election for
Governor on the 20th inst. Conley
opposes it upon the grounds that he
has a right to fill out the unexpired
term of Governor Bullock. Col.Akin
of Savannah, is the the Republican
candidate. He is spoken of as
strong and popular man, and may
be elected, although the State was
carried by the Democracy in 1870.
The Spanish government has has
tened to recall Valmaseda from Cu
ba, under whose rule the eight med
ical students who had decorated the
Cuban General Castanon's tomb with
garlic garlands, were executed. It
seems to have feared the effect of the
brutal executions upon civilized na
tions, and to soften the edge of ex
pected protests, removed the cause .
It has also sent 30,000 regular troops
there to take the place of the volun
teers, whose rule has been so dis
graceful to humanity.
The Proposition of the Secretary
of the Treasury is to pay $50,000,000
of the public debt this fiscal year.
As over $94,000,000 were paid the
past fiscal year, the receipts from
customs and internal revenue sour
ces would indicate an excess of near
ly fifty millions more, unless cur
tailed in some way, the Treasurer
proposes a reduction both of tariff
duties and internal taxes, limiting
the internal revenue sources to
liquors, tobacco and stamps. The
carrying out of this programme will
reduce internal to a merely
nominal character, and the people
generally will only feel that arising
from stamps. It would, perhaps, be
a measure of greater wisdom to make
but slight changes in the tariff law,
and do away with the stamps duties
thus avoiding any direct taxation.
The International League, which
was to have paraded the streets of
New York, on Sunday last, bearing
the red flag, in honor of the Com
munists put to death by the present
French Government, may mean
something or nothing accordingly
as it developes power. The stronger
it becomes the more likely it is to
become the prey of politicians, and
be used for purposes of the worst
kind. It is mostly composed of
foreigners, and is based upon ideas
imbibed in their European homes,
which should have been left behind
when they sought the shores of our
country. The interposition of the
police to prevent the parade on
Sunday, was a step in the proper di
rection. If they parade let them
choose another day.
Albert Edward, Prince of Wales,
whose death is hourly expected is
the second child and eldest son of
Prince Albert and Queen Victoria.
He was born on the 9th of Novem
ber 1841, and had just entered his
31st year. On the 10th of March
1863, he married the Princess Alex
andra, of Denmark, a lady of great
beauty and goodness. They have
had five children, of whom Albert
Victor is the eldest. He was born
on the 8lh of January 1864, After
his father he is heir to the crown,
but 13 years mnst intervene before
he could ascend the throne. In the
meantime, in the event of the death
or abdication of Victoria' a regency
for a number of years would be the
result, unless a revolution should
change the form of government en
tirely. Hence the great excitement
which prevails in England and the
instability of the money markets,
which fluctuates with each dispatch
describing the Prince's condition,
His death will be an event of the
greatest consequence to his country.

THE JOURNAL. Abstracts of Various Reports.
The report of the commisioner of
Internal Revenue states mat tne ag
gregate reoeipts from all sources, ex
elusive 01 tne qisincs tax ujjou
lands, and the duty upon the circu
lation and deposits ot .National
Banks, were for the fiscal year 1871,
$144,011,176. This1 sum includes
amount refunded and allowed on
drawbacks amounting to $610,468,
The Commissioner's estimate of re
ceipts for the current fiscal year, un
der the present law, is $125,000,000;
receipts from spirits for fiscal year.
$46,281,848; amount of tax received
on fermented liquors, $7,159,740;
total receipts from tobacco, for the
year, $33,587,097, an increase of two
and a quarter millions over last year
total amount of manufactured to
bacco, represented by the amount of
collections, is 105,827,963 lbs; total
number of cigars, cheroots, &c, on
which taxes are collected, 2,332,844,
307. The increase is due to the re
cent change in the law, changing the
mode oi collecting on these articles.
The Commissioner favors consoli
dating the tobacco tax at the rate of
24 per cent., if it can be done with
out loss to the government, and ex
presses the opinion that the present
system of export bonded warehouses
can be entirely abolished both to
the interest of government and man
ufa Jturers. He recommends Con
gress to provide that evidence of the
loss of tobacco at sea satisfactory to
the Commissioner of Internal Rev
enuc, and shall have all force of
lending and certificates for the pur
pose of drawback, the want of an
thority to furnish stamps for con
demned tobacco which is constantly
accumulating in the hands of gov
ernment officers, and has" caused
much embarassment. The Commis
sioner recommends that Congress
authorize him, upon the requisition
of officers having the authority and
control over such tobacoo, to furnish
suitable revenue stamps, to be at
tached and cancelled before the same
is offered for sale, as it frequently
happens that the tax is paid, and the
stamps are lost from packages of
spirits by unavoidable accident with
out fault on the part of tne persons
interested, the epint3 being thus ex
posed to seizure and detention. Au
thority is asked for to protect such
spirits by restamplng.
Owing to the Congressional
omission to authorize the remission
of taxes on ship builders, he has re
deemed such taxes collected. He
recommends that the Commissioner
be prohibited from considering or
allowing any claim not presented
within two years from' the time the
tax was paid, and that all claims be
barred from the courts after six
years from the date of the payment
of the tax. lne report concludes
by stating that 330 accounts of ex
Collector are still open, 115 of which
have been placed in the hands of at
torneys for suits against the Bonds
men of delinquents.
The total amount received from
compromised revenue cases for the
year is, $618,597. Total value
seizures, $915,240,
It is understood in navy" circles
that the navy estimates for the fis
cal year ending June 30th, 1873,
amount to about twenty millions.
inese are in tne aggregate more
than $1,200,000 less than the cur
rent year, and more than $500,000
less than the appropriation made by
ijorigress lor that period, It is fur
ther said that the Secretary will re
commend that tne Grade of Com
modore be dispensed with and after
this grade shall have elapsed by
death. Retirement or promotion of
the present incumbents, promotion
be made to grade of rear admiral as
vacancies occur from the list of cap
tains, and that a further decrease be
made in officers by increasing cadet
ship terms from four to six years.
Ihis is recommended as both a mat
ter of efficiency and economy.

provements. Estimate for military
purposes for the fiscal year, endin
June 40th, 1873, is $32,515,472: the
treasury has realized thus far durie
the present fiscal year $21,766,403
from the sale of arm 3 and other
sources. An estimate of three mil
lions is made for the settlement of
claims yet due the States for calling
troops into the service. The Secre
tary says it is with the greatest em
barrassment that the appropriations
made at the last session can be so
economized as to answer the press
ing requirements of the service. He
recommends that extra lieutenants,
authorized to serve as regimental
quartermasters, be discontinued as
vacancies occur in these grades, thus
affecting an ultimate reduction of
eighty lieutenants, and that the
grade of quartermaster sergeants
be abolished ; also, those of company
artificer and wagoner, which will re
lieve 1,165 enlisted men of service
at a yearly cost of $412,750. The
proceeds from the sale of clothing
since June 30th, 1870, to date, is
$1,875,728; the cost of transporta
tion for the year was about $1,500,
000. Southern railroads still owe
the department $4,734,350. The
Secretary alludes to the existence of
an armed rebellion of regular organ
ization and great strength in parts
of the Southern States, and the ne
cessity of using the armed force of
the nation to put it down, and bring
the leaders to speedy justice. Gen
eral Belknap closes with a renewed
recommendation for a fire-proof
building for the War Department,
and the expression of a hope that a
reform will be effected in all the de
partments of the Government by the
labors of the Civil bervice Com
mission. A gentleman the other evening

That Outrage.
In our last issue we stated that
would give a full report. of that
outrage committed on the person of
Miss Belgin, Ganges.by those young
men lmng north of Rome, in our
present number; but we have been
requested to forbear publishing the
rtmes until further investigations.
We shall this time only give in brief
what took place during the commis
mission of this most dastardly
crime we have ever heard of.
One week previous to the Sabbath
evening on which the young la'dy was
taken, tne two young men who took
the leading part, called on her at her
father s house, for the purpose of en
gaging her to go to work at one of
these person s homes, and represent
ed themselves under the names of
some of their neighbors. On the
following" Sunday, one of the said
party came after her as agreed up
on. He arrived about four o'clock,
and the girl got herself in readiness,
as soon as possible, and informed
him accordingly, to which he re
plied that he had been driving his
horses rather hard that day and
guessed he would let them rest
awhile, and waited until it was about
dark when they both started. After
they had gone some little distance
from the house, they were hailed by
man coming out of a field. After
some conversation, this second party
grot into the buggy with them and
on they drove.
The girl was wholy unaware of
their fiendish intention, all this time.
Soon they drove up to gate, through
which they entered and made their
way across a field to a barn, where
they stopped and got out. The girl
thinking this rather strange, said
this is not where you live, is it?"
to which they replied, "it's no mat
ter, 3-0U get out. The poor girl
began to scream at the top of her
voice, to prevent which they tied
handkerchief over her mouth, lhey
carried her into the barn where there
were seven or eight mine of their
comrades waiting like so many de
mons to ravish that unprotected
woman, and so they did one after
another, until she was wholly un
conscious. V hen it had reached
about 1 o'clock at night they took her
back to her Lome in that uncon
scious state and left her lying with
her head on her bundle of clothing
in the front yard, exposed to the
cold and wind. Such we say is
what these men have done, and urge
up the heads oWamilies and all who
would maintain the integrity of our
Bocial order, to see that tbese men
are attended to and their just deserts
meted out to them. Nowhere in the
history of the country is there rest
ing so dark a stain upon any cm
community as this. Shiloh Times,
Mrs. Witter, of North Lima, Mah
oning county, while laboring under
mentaj depression, attempted suicide
by cutting her turoat, and so tar sue
ceeded as to inflict a severe wound
Though her wound is severe,there is
a fair prospect of her recovery.
The jewelry store of II. Cooper,
at Wellsvillc, was burglariously en
tered on the night of Nov. 25. The
thieves stole five trays ot jewelry
gold pens, fcc, but were unsuccess
ful in getting into an inner safe, af
ter having blown open the outer one.
It is the third time that Cooper has
been robbed.
The Bcllaire Nail Works employ
125 to 150 hands, and their pay roll
is nearly $3,000 per week. It will be
seen therefore that this one manu
factory causes the distribution of
about $150,000 per year, among the
other trades and merchant and mar
ket people and real estate owners" of
that stirring town.
Williams Simms, a playmate of
Hawthorne when a boy at Raymond
and who ever afterward enjoyed the
ffrm friendship of the great roman
cer, recently died at Pensacola, Fla.
Mr. Sims, who was a Mulitto, had
possession of the first note book or
diary ot Hawthorne, portions
which he haa occasionally published
with his own reminiscences of the
author.
There, was a grand semi-annual
flagelation at Newcastle, Delaware,
the State of judicial flogging a few
dajs ago. One man was flogged for
the third time, and said that, having
all the manhood flogged out of him,
"he didn't care for aiij'thing." Eight
others were punished with twenty
lashes each, and several in addition
stood for an hour in the pillory. The
offense of each beiug petit larceny.
Lately an unknown party and two
companions in Alliance, proffered to
relieve a small bi uise on Mr. Shidler's
face, by the application of a simple
medicine which they said they would
get at a drug store. Mr. S. consent
ed to the application by means of
pocket handkerchief or towel; and
almost immediately was overtaken
with a strangling and stupefying
sensation.
At last accounts the missing J.'H.
Marks, who was connected with the
engineer service of the Trans Conti
nental Railroad, in Texas, had not
been found. He was last seen at the
engineer's camp, somewhere north
ward of Jefferson. The following
rewards have been offered: $3,000
offered for his recovery, if alive;
$1,000 for his body, if" dead; and
$2,000 is offered, if killed, for the
apprehension of the murderer.
Henceforward regular troops will
garrison the Morro, Cabina and
Principe forts at Havana. In view
of the arrival of reinforcements from
Spain, Valmeseda considers it just
tojelieve the volunteers from this ar
duous service. Spain will send to
Cuba this month four battalions of
troops for the regular army of Spain,
besides ten thousand reinforcements
which are to follow in one 3-ear.
Senor Moreno, the new Governor of
Havana, has begun the work of sup
pressing gambling houses.
TheAsbland Times says that a few
evenings since Mr. Sullivan and wife,
of Perrysville.went from home in the
evening leaving their littie daughter
in the care of a German servant girl,
sixteen years old, named Sphen.
The two went to sleep upon the
lounge during the evening, with
lighted lamp standing upon the shelf
on the opposite side of the room.
When she awoke the lamp was blaz
ing fearfully, and the waU paper was
on fire. She attempted to extinguish
the flames, when her clothes caught
fire, and she was burned to death.

handsome gain. Two years ago Fail-child'

The President of the Western Union Tel
egraph Company does not favor the establish.
ment of a Postal Telegraph system. It is
query whether the government had'nt better
break up all private enterprises, and run the
entire business of the cou utry without the aid
of private parties? If it can usurp one
not all?

The Internationals have, it appears, deter,
mined to defy the police authorities and par
ade on Sunday, armed, to force their way if
obstructed. The dangerous character of the
organization is making itself apparent, and it
should be taught that in this country it will
not do to resist the authorities trusted with the
execution of law.
P. T. Barnuui, the great showman, has
opened out his immense traveling show, in
New York City, for the winter, on Third ave
nue corner of Sixty-third street. After a four
years' rest, the great showman found life too
tedious, and has returned to his old vocation,
with a zest, determinad to wear out rather
than rust. He has an immense show.
At Mechanicsville, Ohie, on the night of the
7th, v fire destroyed a grist mill, oil mill, saw
mill, Darns and outbuildings belonging to B.
Woolever, whose less is set down at 30,000.
By the same fire Geo. Chapman lost two dwel
ling houses and a woolen factory valued at
(5,000, and Thomas Butcher lost (2,000 of
stock in the wool factory. No insurance on
any of the property.
Nillson has been the subject of a romanee.
A poor but enthusiastie German musician has
fallen desperately in love with the divine
songstress, and is bound to win her. His first
essays have not proven very successful, how
ever, although he succeeded in forcing his way
into her room, and in the presence of several
ladies besides his inamorata, attempted to
steal a kiss from her. Ha was arrested, and
taken before a police judge, where upon her
affidavit the persistent lover was charged with
disorderly conduct, and sentenced to six
months imprisonment in the jail.
In view of the death of the Prince of Wales,
it is again rumored that Queen Victoria will
abdicate. As the Prince's son, Albert Victor
is but eight years of age, a Regency, with the
Duke of Edinburg (Victoria's second son,) or
the Duke of Cambridge, the Queen's cousin,
at its head, is probable, with the chances ap
parently favoring the Duke of Cambridge,
who, it is thought, would receivo the support
of the most of tho cnbility, on account of his
age and experience. The Duke of Edinburg
is most popular with the masses. In case of
the Prince's death a political crisis is looked
for.
