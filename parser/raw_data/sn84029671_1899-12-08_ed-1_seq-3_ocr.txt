Washington, Dec 5. President Mc
Sinley to-day transmitted the follow,
ing message to the Fifty-sixth con-
;-gress:
To tbe Senate sod House of Representatives:
At tbe threshold of your deliberations you are
called to mourn with your countryman tbe death
Of Vice President Hobart, who passed from life
cn tbe morning of N vember 21 last. Bis Rood
rsoul now tests in eternal peace. Hii private
life was pure and elevated, wbile bis public
-career was ever dist ngulshed by large capacity,
stainless integrity, and exalted motives. He
bas been removed from tbe high office wbicb be
bonored and dignified, but bis lofty character.
Ibis devotion to duty, bis honesty of purpose,
and noble virtues remain with us, as a priceless
legacy and example.
Aa to tbe Country's Condition.
Tbe Fifty-sixth congress convenes In its first
Tegular session with the country in a condition
of unusual prosperity, of universal good will
among the people at borne, and in relations of
peace aud friendship with every government of
the world. Our foreign commerce has shown
great increase in volume and value. The com
bined imports and exports for the year are the
largest ever' shown in a sin ;le year in all our
iiistory. Our exports for 1899 alone exceeded by
snore than H,0( 0,000,JU our imports and exports
combined in 1870. The imports per capita are
0 per cent, less than in 18.0, while tbe exports
per capita are 68 per cent, more than in 1870,
showing the enlarged capacity of the United
States to satisfy the wants of its own increas
ing population, as well as to contribute to those
of the people of other nations.
Exports of agricultural products were 9784,
776. 142. Of manufactured products we exported
in value 9239,59?, 146, being larger than any pre
vious vear. It is a noteworthy fact that the
only years in all our history when the products
of our manufactories sold abroad were 1898 and
1899. Government receipts from all sources for
the fiscal year ended June 30, lf99, including
911,798,314.14, part payment of the Central Pa
cific railroad indebtedness, aggregated 9610,982,
004.35. Customs receipts were 93)6, 128,431.75,
and those from internal revenue, 9273,437,161.51.
For the fiscal rear the expenditures were 97.
9.,564.0.', leaving a deficit of 189,1 11.559.67. The
secretary of the treasury estimates that the re
ceipts for the current fiscal year will aggregate
9640,958,112. and upon tbe basis of present ap
propriations tbe expenditures will aggregate
9600,958.112. leaving a surplus of 94J.O00.0O0.
For the fiscal year ended June 3 , 1899, the
Internal revenue receipts were increased about
9100,000,000. Tbe present gratifying strength of
the treasury is shown by the fact that on De
cember 1, 1899, the available cash balance was
9278.004,837.72. of which 939.744.9 5.36 was in
gold coin and bullion. The conditions of confi
dence which prevail throughout the country
have brought gold into more general use aud
customs receipts are now almost entirely paid
in that coin.
Increased activity in Industry, with its wel
come attendant a larger employment for labor
at higher wages gives to the body of the people
a larger power to absorb the circulating me
dium. It is further true that year by year, with
larger areas of land under cultivation, the In
creasing volume of agricultural products, cot
ton, corn and wheat, calls for a larger volume
cf money supply.
The National Banking; AeC
In its earlier history tbe national banking act
teemed to prove a reasonable avenue throngh
which needful additions to the circulation could
from time to time be made. Changing condl
. tions have apparently rendered it now inopera
tive to that end. Te high margin in bond se
curities required, resulting from large premi
ums which government bonds command in' the
market, or the tax on note issues, or both oper
ating together, appear to be the influences
which impair its public utility.
The attention of congress is respectfully in
vited to this important matter with the view of
ascertaining whether or not such reasonable
modifications can be made la the national
banking act as will render its service in tbe par
ticulars here referred to more responsive to the
people's needs. I again urge that national banks
be authorized to organize with a capital of 925,
000. For the Gold Standard.
I urgently recommend that to support the ex
isting gold standard, and to maintain "the par
ity in value of the coins of the two metals (gold
and silver) and the equal power of every dollar
at all times in the market and in the payment
of debts," the secretary of the treasury be
given additional power and charged with the
duty to sell United States bonds and to employ
such other effective means as may be necessary
to these ends. Tbe authority should include
the power to sell bonds on long and short time,
as conditions may require, and should provide
for a rate of interest lower than th-it fixed by
tbe act of January 14, 1873. While there is now no
commercial fright which withdraws gold from
the government, but, on the contrary, such
widespread confidence that gold seeks the
treasury demanding paper money in exchange,
yet the very situation points to the present as
the most fitting time to make adequate provi
sion to insure the continuance of the gold stand
ard and of public confidence in tbe ability and
purpose of the government to meet all its obli
gations in tbe money which the civilized world
recognizes as the best. Tbe financial transac
tions of the government are conducted upon a
gold basis. We receipt gold when we sell United
States bonds and use gold for their payment.
We are maintaining the parity of all the money
Issued or coined by authority of the govern
ment. We are doing these things with the
means at hand. Happily at the present time we
are not compelled to resort to loans to supply
gold.' It has been done in the past, however,
and may have to be done in the future. It be
hooves us, therefore, to provide at once the best
means to meet the emergency when It arises,
and the best means are those which, are the
. most certain and economical. Those now au
thorized have the virtue neither of directness or
economy. We have already eliminated one of
the causes of our financial plight and embar
rassment during the years 1893, 1894. 1805 and
1896. Our receipts now equal our expenditures;
deficient revenues no longer create alarm. Let
us remove the only remaining cause by confer
ring the full and necessary power on the secre
tory of the treasury and impose upon him the
duty to uphold the present gold standard and
preserve the coins of the two metals on a parity
with each other, which is tbe repeatedly de
clared policy of the United States.
In this connection I repeat my former reeom
menctlons that a portion of the gold holdings
shal. be placed in a trust fund from whicn
greenbacks shall be redeemed upon presenta
tion, but when once redeemed shall not there
alter be paid out except for gold.
For a Mare bant Marine. .
Tbe value of an American merchant marine
Jo the extension of our commercial trade and
the strengthening of our power upon the sea in
vites the immediate action of congress. Our
national development will be one-sided and un
satisfactory so long as the remarkable growth
of our inland industries remains unaccompa
nied by progress on the seas. There is bo lack
of constitutional authority for legislation which
shall give to the country maritime strength
commensurate with its industrial achievements
and with its rank among the nations of the
earth.
As to Trnata and Combinations.
The Industrial commission, created by the
act of the congress of June 18, 1898, has been
engaged in extended hearings upon the dis
puted questions involved in the subject of com
binations in restraint of trade and competition.
They have not yet completed their investiga-
tion of this subject, and the .conclusions and i
recommendations at which they may arrive are j
undetermined. The subject is one giving rise j
to many divergent views as to the nature and J
variety or cause and extent of the injuries to (
the public which may result from large combl- ,
nations concentrating more or less numerous j
enterprises and establishments, which previ- j
ously to the formation of the combination were i
carried on separately.
It is universally conceded that combinations
which engross or control the market of any
particular kind of merchandise or commodity
necessary to the general community, by sup- j
pressing natural and ordinary competition,
whereby prices are unduly enhanced to the
general consumer, are obnoxious not only to
the common law, but also to the public welfare.
There must be a remedy for the evils Involved
in such organizations. If the present law can
be extended more certainly to control or check
these monopolies or trusts, it should be done
without delay. Whatever power the congress
possesses over this most important subject
should be promptly ascertained and asserted.
State Iecl"!atlon Inadequate.
The state legislation to which President Cleve
land looked for relief from the evils pf trusts
has failed to accomplish fully that object. This
probably is due to a great extent to the fact
that different states take different views as to
the proper way to discriminate between evil
Injurious combinations and those associations
which are beneficial and necessary to the busi
ness prosperity of the country. The great di
versity of treatment in different states aris
ing from this cause, and the Intimate rela
tions of all parts of the country to each other
without regarding state lines In tbe conduct of
business, have made the enforcement of state
laws difficult.
It is apparent that uniformity of legislation
upon this subject in the several states is much
to be desired. It is to be hoped that such uni -formlty
founded in a wise and just discrimi
nation between what is injurious and what is
useful . and necessary in business operations
may be obtained, and that means may be found
for the congress within the limitation of its
constitutional power so to supplement an effect
ive code of state legislation as to make a com
plete system of laws throughout the United
States adequate to compel a general observance
of the salutary rules to which I have referred.
Oar I liferent in China.
In view of disturbances in the populous prov
inces of northern China, where are many of
our citizens, and of the Imminence of disorder
near the capital and toward the seaboard, a
guard of marines was landed from the Boston
and stationed during last winter in tbe legation
compound at Peking. With the restoration of
order this protection was withdrawn. The in
terests of our citizens in that vast empire have
not been neglected during the past year. Ade
quate protection has been secured for our mis
sionaries and some Injuries to their property
have been redressed.
In my message to congress of December 5,
1898, I urged that the recommendation which
had been made to the speaker of the house of
representatives by the secretary of the treas
ury on the lith of June. 1898, for an appropria
tion for a commission to study the commercial
and industrial conditions in the Chinese empire
and report as to tbe opportunities for, and ob
stacles to, the enlargement of markets in China
for the raw products and manufactures of the
United States, should receive at your hands the
consideration which its importance and timeli
ness merited, but the congress failed to take
action.
I now renew this recommendation, as the im
portance of the subject has steadily grown since
it was first Submitted to you, and no time should
be lost in studying for ourselves the resources
of this great field for American trade and enter
prise. .
The Transvaal War.
This government has maintained an attitude
of neutrality in the unfortunate contest between
Great Britain and the Boer states of Africa.
We have remained faithful to the precept of
avoiding entangling alliances as to affairs not
of our direct concern. Had circumstances sug
gested that 'the parties to the quarrel would
have welcomed any kindly expression of the
hope cf the American people that war might be
averted, good offices would bave been gladly
tendered. The United States representative at
Pretoria was early .instructed to see that all
neutral American interests be respected by the
combatants. This has been an easy taste in
view of the positive declarations on both Brit
ish and Boer authorities that the personal and
property rights of our citizens should be ob
served. Wants a Cable to Manila.
The Japanese government bas shown a lively
interest in tbe proposition of the Pacific Cable
company to add to its projected cable lines- to
Hawaii. Guam and the Philippines a branch
connection with the coast of Japan. It would
be a gratifying consummation were tbe utility
of the contemplated scheme enhanced by bring
ing Japan and the United States into direct
telegraphio. relation. Without repeating the
observations of my special message of February
1C. l9i, concerning the necessity of a cable to
Manila, I respectfully invite attention to it. I
recommend that in case the congress should not
take measures to bring about this result by the
direct action of the government, the postmaster
general be authorize J to invite competitive bids
for the establishment of a cable; the company
making the best responsible bid to be awarded
the contract; the successful company to give
ample bonds to Insure the completion of the
wcrk within a reasonable time.
Tbe Problem In Cuba.
The withdrawal of the authority of Spain
from the is laud of Cuba was effected by the first
of January, so that the full re-establishment of
peace found the relinquished territory held by
us in trust for the inhabitants, maintaining, un
der the direction of the executive, such govern
ment and control therein as should conserve
public order, restore the productive conditions
of peace so long disturbed by tbe Instability
and disorder which prevailed for the greater
part of the preceding three decades and build
up that tranquil development of the . domestic
state whereby alone can be realized the high
purpose, as proclaimed in the joint resolution
adopted by the congress on the 19th of April.
1898, by which the United States disclaimed any
opposition or intention to exercise sovereignty,
jurisdiction or control over Cuba, except for the
pacification thereof, and asserted its determi
nation when that was accomplished to leave the
government and control of the Island to its peo
ple. Tbe pledge contained in this resolution is
of tbe highest honorable obligation and must be
sacredly kept.
This nation has assumed before the world a
grave responsibility for the future good gov
ernment of Cuba. We have accepted a trust
the fulfillment of which calls for the sternest
integrity of purpose and the exercise of the
highest wisdom. The new Cuba yet to arise
from the ashes of the past must needs be bound
to us by ties of singular intimacy and strength
if its enduring welfare is to be assured.
Whether those ties shall be organic or conven
tional, the destinies of Cuba are in some right
ful form and manner irrevocably linked with
our own. but how or how far is for the future to
determine in the ripeness of events. - Whatever
be the outcome, we must see to it that free Cuba
be a reality, not a name, a perfect entity, not a
hasty experiment bearing within Itself the ele
ments of failure. Our mission, to accomplish
which we took up tbe wages of battle. Is not to
be fulfilled by turning adrift any loosely framed
commonwealth to face the vicissitudes which
too often attend weaker states whose natural
wealth and abundant resources are offset by the
incongruities of their political organization and
the recurring occasions for internal rivalries to
sap their strength and dissipate their energies
The greatest blessing which can come to Cuba
is the restoration of her agricultural and indus
trial prosperity, which will give employment to
idle men and re-establish the pursuits of peace.
This is her chief and immediate need.
By the treaty of peace the Spanish poeple on
the island bare until April 11, 19J0, to elect
whether they will remain riiizens of Spain or
become citizens of Cub i. Until then it cannot
be definitely ascertained who shall be entitled
to participate In tbe formation of the gov
ernment of Cuba. By that time the results of
the census will have been tabulated, and we
shall proceed to provide for elections which
will commit the municipal governments 6f the.
island to the officers elected by the people. The
experience thus acquired will prove of great
vaiue in the formation of a representative con
vention of the people to draft a constitution
and establish a general system of independent
government for the island. In the meantime
and so long as we exercise control over the
Island the products of Cuba should have a
market in the United States on as good terms
and with aa favorable rates of duty as are given
to tbe West India islands under treaties of re
ciprocity which shall be made.
Concerning Oar Soldier and Sailors.
Since my last annual message and in obedi
ence to the acts of the congress of April 22 and
6, 1898, the remaining volunteer force enlisted
for the Spanish war, consisting of 34,834 regulars
and 11 ,202 volunteers, with over 5,0.0 volunteer
officers, has been discharged from the military
service. Of the volunteers, 667 officers and 11,
831 men were serving in the Philippines and 1.
650 of the regulars, who were entitled to be mus
tered out after the ratification of the treaty of
peace. They voluntarily7 remained at the front
until their places could be filled by new troops.
They were returned home in the order in which
they went to Manila, and are now all of them
out of the service and in the ranks of citizen
ship. I recommend that the congress provide
a special medal of honor for the volunteers,
regulars, sailors, and marines on duty in the
Philippines, who voluntarily remained in the
service after their terms of enlistment had ex
pired. By the act of March 2, 1899, congress has au
thority to Increase the regular army to a maxi
mum not exceeding 6,0OJ enlisted men and to
enlist a force of 35,u0) volunteers, to be recruited
from the country at large. By virtue of this au
thority the regular army has been increased to
the number of 61,999 enlisted men and 2,248 offi
cers and new volunteer regiments have been or
ganized aggregating 33,050 enlisted men and
1 ,524 officers. Two of these volunteer regiments
are made up of colored men, with colored line
officers. Tbe new troops to take the place of
those returning frou the Philippines hive been
transported to Manila to the number of 581 offi
cers and -6,322 enlisted men of the regular army
and 594 officers and 15,388 enlisted men of the
new volunteer force, while 504 officers and 14,
119 men of the volunteer force are on the ocean
en route to Manila. The force now In Manila
consists of 90i officers and 30.5C8 regulars and
591 officers and 15,388 of the volunteers, making
an aggregate of 1,499 officers and 45.966 men.
When the troops now under orders shall reach
Manila, the force in the archipelago will com
prise 2,051 officers and 63,483 men.
During the past year we have reduced our
force in Cuba and Porto Rico. In Cuba we now
bave 3i4 officers and 10,696 men; in Porto Rico,
87 officers and 2,855 enlisted men and a battalion
of 400 men, composed of native Porto Kicans;
while stationed throughout the United States
are 910 officers and 17,317 men and In Hawaii, 12
officers and 4"-3 enlisted men.
The operations of the army are fully present
ed In the report of the secretary of war. I can
not withhold from officers and men the highest
commendation for their soldierly conduct in
trying situations, their willing sacrifices for
their country and the interest and ability with
which they performed unusual and difficult du
ties in our island possessions.
Tbe Qnestion of Pensions.
On the 30th of June, 1899, the pension roll of
the United States numbered 921,519. These in
clude the pensioners of the army and navy in
all our wars. The number added to the rolls
during the year was 40,991. The number dropped
by reason of death, remarriage, minors by legal
limitations, failure to claim within three years
and other causes was 43,186, and the number of
claims disallowed was 107,917. During the year
89,1)54 pension certificates were issued, of which
37,077 were for new or original pensions. The
amount disbursed for army and navy pensions
during the year was 9l38,35,52.95, which was
9t,&l,451.61 less than the sum of the appropria
tions. The Grand Army of the Republic at its re
cent national encampment held at Philadelphia
has brought to my attention and to that of con
gress the wisdom and justice of a modification
of the third section of the act of June 27, 1830,
which provides pensions for the widows of
officers and enlisted men who served 90 days or
more during the war of the rebellion and were
honorably discharged, provided that such
widows are without other means of support
than their daily labor and were remarried to
the soldier, sailor or marine on account of
whose service they claim pension prior to the
date of the act.
The present holding of tbe department is that
if the widow's income aside from her daily labor
does not exceed in amount what her pension
would be, to wit: 998 per annum, she would be
deemed to be without other means of support
than her daily labor, and would.be entitled to a
pension under this act, while if the widow's in
come, independent of the amount received by
her as the result of her daily labor exceeds 906.
she wou d not be pensionable under the act I
am advised by the commissioner of pensions
that the amount of the income allowed before
title to pension would be barred, has varied
widely under different administrations of the
pension office. ?s well as during different periods
of the same administration, and has been the
cause of just complaint and criticism. With the
approval of the secretary of the interior, the
commissioner of pensions recommends that, in
order to make the practice at all times uniform
and to do justice to the dependent widow, the
amount of income allowed Independent of the
proceeds of her daily labor should be not less
than 9 J50 per annum, and he urges that congress
shall so amend the act as to permit the pension
office to grant pensionable status to widows
under the text of the third section of the act of
June 27, 189a whose income aside from the pro
ceeds of dally labor is not in excess of 9250 per
annum. I believe this to be a simple act of jus
tice and I heartily recommend it.
Favors a Larger Navy.
I heartily concur in the recommendations for
the increase of the navy, as suggested by the
secretary.
The All-Absorbing Philippine Question.
On the 10th of December, 1898. the treaty of
peace between the United States and Spain
was signed. It provided, among other things,
that Spain should cede to the United States the
arcbipe ago known as the Philippine islands;
that the United States should pay to Spain the
sum of 920,000,000, and that the civil rights and
political status of the native inhabitan ts of the
territories they ceded to the United States
should be determined by the congress. The
treaty was ratified by the senate on the 6th of
February, 1899. and by the government of Spain
on the 19th of March following. The ratifica
tions were exchanged on the 11th of April and
the treaty publicly proclaimed. On the 2d of
March the congres&s voted the sum contem
plated by the treaty, and the amount was paid
over to the Spanish government on the 1st of
May.
In this manner the Ph ill opines came to the
United States. The islands were ceded by the
government of Spain, which had been in undis
puted possession of them for centuries. They
were accepted not merely by our author
ized commissioners in Paris under the
direction of the executive, but by the constitu
tional and well considered action of the repre
sentatives of the people of the United States in
both houses of congress. I had every reason to
believe, and I still believe, that this transfer of
sovereignty was in accordance with the wishes
and the aspirations of the great mass of the
Filipino people. From the earliest moment no
opportunity was lost of assuring the people of
the Islands of our ardent desire for their wel
fare and of the intention of this government to
do everything possible to advance their inter
ests. In my order of the 19th of May. 1888, the
commander of the military . expedition dis
patched to the Philippines was instructed to
declare that we came not to make war upon the
people of the country, "nor upon any part or
faction among them, but to protect them In
their homes, in their employments and In their
personal and religious rights.
That there should be no doubt as to the para
mount authority there, on the 17th of August,
it was directed that ''there must be no joint oc
cupation with the insurgents:" that the United
States must preserve the peace and protect per
sons and property within th 3 territory occupied
by their military and naval forces; that the in
surgents and all others must recognize the
military occupation and authority of the
United States. As early as December 4. before
the cession and in anticipation of that event,
the commander in Manila was urged to restore
peace and tranquillity and to undertake the
establishment of a beneficent government,
which should afford the fullest security for life
and property.
On the 21st of December, after the treaty was
signed, the commander of the forces of occupa
tion was instructed '"to announce and proclaim
in the most public manner that we come, not as
invaders and conquerors, but as friends to pro
tect the natives in their homes, in their employ
ments and in their personal and religious
rights."
The same day, while ordering Gen. Otis to see
that the peace should be preserved in Iloilo, he
was admonished that: ' It is most important
that there should be no conflict with the insur
gents. On the first day of January, 18J9, your
general orders were reiterated that the kindly
intentions of this government should be in
every possible way communicated to the insur
gents." On the 21st of January I announced my in
tentions of dispatching to Manila a commission
composed of three gentlemen of the highest
character and distinction, thoroughly acquaint
ed with the orient, who, in association with Ad
miral Dewey and Maj. Gen. Otis, were instruct
ed to "facilitate the most humane and effective
extension of authority throughout the islands
and to secure, with the least possible delay, the
benefits of a wise and generous protection of
life and property to the inhabitants."
But before their arrival at Manil-i the sinis
ter ambition of a few leaders of the Filipinos
had created a situation full of embarrassments
for us and most grievous in its consequences to
themselves. The clear and impart! U prelimi
nary report of the commissioners, which I trans
mit herewith, gives so lucid and comprehensive
a history of the present insurrectionary move
ment that the story need not be repeated. It is
enough to say that the claim of the rebel leader
that he was promised independence by any of
ficer of the United States in return for his as
sistance has no foundation in fact and is cate
gorically denied by the very witnesses who were
called to prove it. The most the insurgent lead
er hoped for when he came back to Manila was
the liberation of the islands from the Spanish
control, which they had been laboring for years
without success to throw off.
Tbe prompt accomplishment of this work by
the American army and navy gave him other
ideas and ambitions, and Insidious suggestions
from various quarters perverted the purposes
and Intentions with which he had taken up
arms. No sooner had our army captured Ma
nila than tbe - Filipino forces began to assume
an attitude of suspicion and hostility which the
utmost efforts of our officers and troops were
unable to disarm or modify. Their kindness
and forbearance were taken as a proof of cow
ardice. The aggressions of the Filipinos con
tinually increased until finally, just before tbe
time set for the senate of the United States for
a vote upon the treaty, an attack, evidently
prepared in advance, was made all along the
American lines, which resulted in a terribly de
structive and sanguinary repulse of the insur
gents. Ten days later an order of the insurgent gov
ernment was issued to its adherents who had
remained in Manila, of which Gen. Otis justly
observes that "for barbarous intent it is un
equal ed In modern times." It directs that at
eight o'clock on the night of the 4 th of Febru
ary the territorial militia shall come together
In the streets of San Pedro, armed with their
bolos, with guns and ammunition, where con
venient; that Filipino families only shall be re
spected: but that all other individuals, of what
ever race they may be, shall be exterminated
without any compassion, after the extermina
tion of the army of occupation, add adds:
"Brothers, we must avenge ourselves on the
Americans and exterminate them, that we may
take our revenge for the infamies and treach
eries which they bave committed upon us.
Have no compassion upon them; attack with
vigor." -
A copy of this fell, by good fortune, into the
hands of our officers and they were able to take
measures to control the rising, which was actu
ally attempted on the night of February 22,
a week later than was originally contem
plated. Considerable number of armed insur
gents entered the city by waterways an I
swamps and in concert with confederates inside
attempted to destroy Manila by fire. They
were kept in check during the night and the
next day driven out of the city with heavy loss
This was the unhappy condition of affairs
which confronted our commissioners on their
arrival in Manila. They had come with the
hope and intention of co-operating with Ad
miral Dewey and Maj. Gen. Otis In establishing
peace and order In the archipelago and "the
largest measure of self-government compatible
with the true welfare of the people. What they
actually found can best be set forth In their own
words:
"Deplorable as war is, the one in which we
are now engaged was unavoidable by us. We
were attacked by a bold, adventurous and en
thusiastic army. No alternative was left to us,
except ignominous retreat.
"It is not to be conceived of that any Ameri
can would have sanctioned the surrender of
Manila to the Insurgents. Our obligations to
other nations and to the friendly Filipinos and
to ourselves and our flag demanded that force
should be met by force. Whatever the future
of the Philippines may be, there is no course
open to us now except to prosecute the war un
til the insurgents are reduced to submission.
The commission is of the opinion that there has
been no time since the destruction of the Span
ish squadron by Admiral Dewey when it was
possible to withdraw our forces from the is
lands, either with honor to ourselves or safety
to the inhabitants."
Tbe course thus clearly indicated has been
unflinchingly pursued. The rebellion must be
put down. Civil government cannot be thor
oughly established until order is restored. With
a devotion end gallantry worthy cf its most
brilliant history, the army, ably and loyally as
sisted by the navy, has carried on this unwel
come, but most righteous campaign, with richly
deserved success. The noble self-sacrifice with
which our soldiers and sailors whose service
had expired refused to avail themselves of their
right to return home as long as they were need
ed at the front forms one of the brightest pages
in our annals. Although their operations have
been somewhat Interrupted and checked by a
rainy season of unusual violence and duration,
they have gained ground steadily in every direc
tion, and now look forward confidently to a
speedy completion of their task.
The unfavorable circumstances connected
with an active campaign have not been permit
ted to interfere with the equally Important work
of reconstruction. Azain, I invite your atten
tion to the report of the commissioners for the
interesting and encouraging details of the work
already accomplished in the establishment of
peace and order and the inauguration of self
governing municipal life in many portions of
the archipelago.
I communicate these facts to the congress for
its information and action. Everything indi
cates that with the speedy suppression of the
Tagalo rebellion, life in the archipelago will
soon assume its ordinary -course under the pro
tection of. our sovereignty and the peopie of
these" favored islands will enjoy a prosperity
and a freedom which they have never before
known. Already hundreds of schools are
open and filled with children. Religious free
dom Is sacredly assured and enjoyed. The
courts are dispensing justice. Business Is be
ginning to circulate in its accustomed channels,
Manila, whose inhabitants were fleeing to the
countt y a few months ajo, is now a populous
and thriving mart of commerce. The earnest
and unremitting endeavors of the commission
and the admiral and major general command
ing the department of the Pacific tr assure the
people of the beneficent intentions of th's gov
ernment, have had their legitimate effect iu
convincing the great m:iss of them that peace
and safety and prosperity and stable govern
ment can only be found in a lojr.l acceptance of
the authority of the United States.
The future government of the Philippines
rests with the congress of the United States.
Few graver responsibilities have ever been
confided to us. If we accept them in a spirit
worthy of our race and our traditions, a great
opportunity comes with them The islands lie
under the shelter of our flag. They are ours by
every title of law and equity. They cannot
be abandoned. If we desert them we leave
them at once to anarchy and finally to barbar
ism. We fling th -m. a golden apple of discord,
among the rival powers, no one of which could
permit another to seize them unquestioned.
Their rich plains and valleys would be the
the scene of endless strife and bloodshed. The
advent of Dewey's fleet in Manila bay instead
of being, as we hope, the dawn of a new day of
freedom and progress, w. 11 have been the begin
ning of an era of misery and violence worse
than any which has darkened their unhappy
past. The suggestion has been made that we
could renounce our authority over the islands
and give them independence, could retain a pro
tectorate over them. This proposition will not
be found, I am sure, worthy of your serious at
tention. Sucn an arrangement would involve
at the out-et a cruel breach of faith. It would
place the peaceable and majority, who ask noth
ing better than to accept our authority, at the
mercy of armed insurgents. It would make us
responsible for the acts of the insurgent leaders
and give us no power to control them It would
charge us with the task of protecting them
against each other, and defending them against
any foreim power with which they chose to
quarrel. In short, it would take from the con
gress of the United States the power of declar
ing war and vest that tremendous prerogative
in the Tagalo leader of the hour.
It does not seem desirable that I should rec
ommend at this time a specific and final form
of government for these islands. When peace
shall be restored it will be the duty of congress
to construct a plan of government which shall
establish and maintain freedom and order and
peace in the Philippines. The insurrection is
still existing and wnen it terminates further in
formation will be required as to the actual con
dition of affairs before inaugurating a perma
nent scheme of civil government. The full re
port of the commission, now in preparation,
will contain information and suggestions which
will be of value to congress and which I will
transmit as soon as it is completed.
I shall put at the disposal of , thi army and
navy all the means which the liberality of con
gress and the people have provided to cause
this unprovoked and wasteful insures :tion to
cease. If any or iers of mine were required to
insure the merciful conduct of military and
naval operations, they would not be lacking;
but every step of the progress of our troops has
been marked by a humanity which bas sur
prised even the misguided insurgents. The
j truest kindness to them will be a swift and ef
fective defeat of their present leader. The
hour of victory will be an hour of clemency and
reconstruction.
No effort will be made to build up the waste
places desolated by war and long years of mis
government. We shall not wait for the end ot
the strife to begin the beneficent work. We
shall continue, as we have begun, to open the
schools and the churches, to set the courts la
operation, to fester industry and trade and ag
riculture and in every way in our power to
make these people whom Providence has
brought within our. jurisdiction feel that it is
their liberty and not our power, their welfare
and not our gain that we are seeking to
enhance. - Our flag has never waved over any
community but in blessing. I believe the Flli
I pinos will soon rcco'-nize the fact that it has
j not lost its gift of benediction la its worldwide
journey to their shores.

I The system of civil jurisprudence now adopted
by the people of Prto Kico is described by
competent lawyers who are familiar with it as
; thoroughly modern and scientific, so far as it re-
lates to matters of internal business, trade
; production and social and private rights in gen
j er. L The cities of the island are governed un-
der charters which probably require very little
J or no chancre. So that with relation to matters
j of local concern and private right it is not
j probable that much If any legislation is desir

eral government there are miny matters which
are of pressing urgency.
( Tbe fundamental requirement for these peo-
pie. as for all people. Is education. The free

cised that ch inges be not made too abruptly
and that the history and racial peculiarities of
the Inhabitants shall be given due weight. Sys

founded cn common sense methods, adapted to
existing conditions and looking to the future
movement and Industrial advancement of the
people, will commend to them in a peculiarly
effective manner the blessings of free govern

The year has been marked by constant In
crease in the intimacy of our relations with
Mexico and in the magnitude of mutually ad
vantageous interchanges. This government has
omitted no opportunity to show its strong desire
to develop and perpetuate the ties of cordiality
now so long happily unbroken.
In Conclusion. . .
Presented to this congress are great oppor
tunities. With them come great responsibili
ties. Toe power confided to us increase the
weight of our obligations to the people, and we
must be profoundly sensitive of them as we
contemplate the new and grave probieiriSfWhlca
confront us. Aiming only at the public good,
we cannot err. A right Interpretation of tbe
people's will and of duty cannot fail to insure
wise measures for the welfare of the islands
whi-h have come under the authority of
the United States and insure to the eommoa
interest and lasting honor ot our country.
