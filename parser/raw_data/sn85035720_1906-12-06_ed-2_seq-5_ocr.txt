SAY HE CONFESSED
Report that Gillette Changed His
Story of Tragedy.
HKHKlMEU. N. Y? Dec. O.?"When
Chester E. Gillette, the convicted mur
derer of "Billy" Brown, his sweet
iieart, told on the witness stand his pit
ittlily weak story of how the little fac
tory girl had jumped Into Big Moose
lake and committed suicide it is said
here that there were six men In the
courtroom who knew us well as he did
that he was lying.
Two days before he is said to have
confessed to former Senator Mills, his
counsel, that he had struck the girl In
the water, that."Billy" Brown rose to
the surface once after she went over
board and that the man for whom she
had sacrificed honor and faith and
beauty leaned over the side of the boat
and dealt her a htow-which stilled her
forever.
The report says that Mills entered |
Gillette's cell last week and informed |
the prisoner tliut lie would have to j
take the witness stand in Ills own de- \
fense. He asked him to go over again ]
file different events of the fatal day. !
Gillette did tills, hut when be got to j
the point where he had insisted 011 til! I
previous oeeaslons that the girl had j
leaped to death he told about striking I
her us she rose beside the boat.
"You little wretch!" Mills is said to I
have shouted, "Why didn't yon ever !
tell me this before?"
Gillette was silent.
.Gillette will not have the sentence of
(lOilfTi passed upon him today, as was
announced, by the court. His counsel
proposes fo niake.a motion for a new
trial, and to ilo so It will lie necessary
for tlrAm to have 11 traifscript of cer
tain phases of the evidence which the
court stenographer cannot prepare he

JAPANESE !
QUESTION.
Envoy of the Mikado Personal
ly Thanks President Roose
velt for Ideas in Message.
WASHINGTON, Dec. (t. - Without .
debate the senate adopted a resolution
calling on the secretary of commerce
and labor to furnish the senate copies
I of all official letters, telegrams, re
ports, etc.. tiled in the department in 1
connection with the investigation of
the matter of the Japanese attending
the public schools of San Francisco. '
The resolution was presented by Sena
tor Fltoit (Cat). ?
The president confidently expects to i
be able to settle the troublesome prob
lem that has arisen because of the dis
crimination against Japdnese in the
schools of San Francisco. Neither he
nor any other member of the adminis- '
tration lias the remotest idea that there
will be war or ecfn a breucli of the
friendly relations between Japan and'
this country.
The California delegation in congress
has rbcelved what they consider satis- '
factory assurance that tjie president
did ilot desire to be understood as say
ing In the Japanese section of bis lues- '
sage that be would use tlie military
force of the United States in forcing
Japanese Into the California schools In
which white children are taught.
It is said to have been his purpose
to convey the Idea that lie would use
the military to protect Japanese against
mob violence. Califoruiaus take 110 of,
t'ense at tbls Interpretation of the mes
sage and agree that the chief executive j
should do everything In his power to
protect Japanese as well as all other j ,
foreigners against violence.
"This whole San Francisco affair is ,
proving to lie a tempest In a teapot." i
Representative Julius Kalin said. "It j,
will die out rapidly us so m as there Is (
a general understanding as to why
California takes the position It does,
"The courts and not the public must
settle all the legal questions involved j (
hi the Sau Fruueiseo school situation." j .
'That the president's views on the!
subject meet with tho hearty approval '
of the Japanese government was made
evident when Viscount Aoki, the Japa
nese ambassador, yesterday personally
thanked the president for what be had j 1
said in Ills message regarding the i
vexed question.
I'ostmnstei General (leoige R, Oor
tolyou will be confirmed as secretary j
of the treasury within,a few days, as
.there is no disposition on the part of ,
the senate to refure b'.ni en1"::iation. j

f'MKHlTY J^THRESTING" rending
MEN IN UNIFORM.
President's Defense of Soldiers and
Sailors Bears Fruit.
WASHINGTON, Doc. 6.?President
Roosevelt's expression recently of bis
vigorous views uguinst the discrimina
tion shown by the managers of some
I heaters and other places of amuse
ment against the uniform of Hie Unit
ed States army and navy, particularly
the latter und against the men who
wear that uniform, already is bearing
substantial fruit.
That members of the theatrical pro
Cession do not sympathize with the at
titude of some amusement managers
on this subject is evidenced by the fol
lowing letter received by Secretary of
the Navy Bonaparte from S. Good
friend, manager of the Columbia thea
ter, Washington, the publication of
which inytuthorized:
"Mr. Secretary?I have the honor on
liehalf of Idgb.v Bell and his manager,
Daniel V. Arthur, to extend a cordial
invitation to the sailors in uniform of
the United States navy now stationed
it the Washington navy yard and to
the sailors on any of the United States
war vessels at present in tills vicinity
to attend the opening performance of
Dlgb.v Bell and company in Augustus
Thomas' comedy 'The Education of Air.
IMpp' at the Columbia theater on Mon
day evening, Dec. 10. loot!.
"They desire you to consider this as
an expression of hearty accord with
the sentiments expressed by the presi
dent and yourself and by Admiral
Dewey in a New York paper in ref
erence to the exclusion of sailors in
the United States service from a then
ter at Newport while in un#orm.
"The members of the theatrical pro
fession share with other citizens of our
country the admiration every Ameri
can must feel for the brave seamen j
who tight the country's battles>at sea
and who have brought such great pride j
and glory to the American flag.
"Hoping to receive your early and j
favorable reply."
The sailors both ashore and afloat at 1
the Washington navy yard have ac- |
:'0pted Mr. Bell's Invitation.
