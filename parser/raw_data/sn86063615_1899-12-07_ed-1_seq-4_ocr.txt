KAXSAS CITY PROSPERITY.
There Is no better indication of the gen
eral business condition of. a city than that
which Is to' be -found in Us bank state
ments. Kansas City considered herself ex-
. ceedlngly prosperous one year ago, when
ythe deposits of "her national banks aggre-
' gated $23,119,541. but the statements of De-
. cember 2 of the present year show that
the deposlts.of these banks at this time
amount to J43.01S.130, a gain of nearly $10,
000.000 In twelve months, and the demand
x for money keeps pace with the Increase In
deposits. The loans and discounts of these
banks have Increased nearly $3,000,000 with-
In the year. Indicating a healthy condition
'of the money market.
' If to the accumulations of the national
banks could be added those of the state
.banks, the showing would be still better.
It is clear that Kansas City 13 rapidly as
suming an importance as a money center
that is commensurate with her Influence
os a trade metropolis. There are, of
course, many minds among many men, and
there are persons in Kansas City who still
" make It their business to discount not only
general but local prosperity, and for no
"other reason than because existing condi
tions are making good the promises of the
last Republican campaign on national Is
sues. But the" pessimistic, views of these
ultra partisans happily few In number
are discounted by Intelligent citizens and
outsiders exactly 100, per cent.
POLYGAMISTROBERTS.
While the 'Roberts case has not yet been
disposed of. the end Is clear and Inevita
ble "the polygamlst will not be permitted
to represent his district in the national
house of representatives. Fortunately for
the good name of the country, opposition
to Mr. Roberts is not confined to one party.
and fortunately the sentiment against him
is almost unanimous. It Is reasonably
certain that the final vote to deny him a
seat in congress will be about the same as
that by which the Taylor resolution was
adopted. There have been several Instances
in which amnesty has been granted to
officials who at one time or another had
lived pDlygamously, but there is no prece
dent upon -which Mr. Roberts can base a
claim, for he has openly and persistently
defied the laws. The widespread and out
spoken sentiment against seating the Utah
representative Is an unmlstakble evidence
of the respect in which the American home
Is "held. The ready acquiescence of a large
majority of the house in this sentiment
shows the value of popular appeal when
the appeal Is based upon right. Mr.
Roberts will wait for conclusive action, but
so far as his congressional prospects are
concerned, he might as well take his
clothes and go.
KAXSAS CITY'S COXVEXTIOX RIVALS.
The most formidable rival Kansas City
has in the effort to secure the next Dem
ocratic national convention has just en
tered the field- There has been no har
mony or serious purpose In the Chicago
movement to capture the prize. Milwau
kee has. made on earnest fight, but her
claims and chances are in no wise so
strong as those of Kansas City. Now
comes New York, lavishly flourishing a
Tammany roll, and obtrusively claiming
that when that city takes a notion to go
after anything all rivals might as well
stand back. It is doubtless true that If the
convention Is to go to the highest bidder.
New York will get the plum: but it is not
probable that the members of the national
committee are going to auction off the
honor. If this were the belief, or, rather.
If it had been, no effort would have been
made by Kansas City, especially If It
had been known that Tammany was to be
a. bidder.
The committee will doubtless bear In
mind that it is only fair to the people of
the West that they should have one'of the
great conventions now and then, and It will
also remember that Kansas City was first
.In the field with an organized effort and
a pledge as to the amount necessary to
handle the big gathering. As to the po
litical considerations that may influence
the committee In making Its choice we do
not profess to be intimately Informed; but
looking at the situation In a general way.
It would seem that Kansas City can pre
sent as strong arguments on the ground of
policy as any other place in the country.
SIERCHAXTMARIXE AXDHIE CAXAL.
In the line of Industrial development
there are no more important recommenda
tions In the president's message than those
relating to the merchant marine and the
Nicaragua canal. The proposal to foster
and enlarge American shipping and the
scheme lo connect the Atlantic and the
Pacific by means of an isthmian canal are
closely related.
The need of a larger merchant marine
Is too apparent to require review or reit
eration. Suffice It to say that while our
coast trade Is larger than that of any other
cation In the world, our seagoing trade I
pitifully small, nearly all of our exports
and Imports being carried on foreign bot
toms. It" Is an anomalous condition in
national affairs,- and it-ls-a 'condition "that
Is particularly .inharmonious in a nation
thatr Justly prides' Itself on Its resources
and Independence. It Is evident that Amer
ican shipping will not be greatly, enlarged
unless the government comes to the aid
of the shipping Industry, as other govern
ments have aided their, shipping Interests.
It Is most unnatural, as It Is most un
fortunate, that the movement to enlarge
the merchant marine should be saddled
with political prejudice in certain quarters.
It is a movement that should have the
support of all parties in fact, as It has
had in party declarations from time to
time. The ridiculous twaddle about Hark
Hanna In connection with the merchant
marine, absurd as the representations are,
may have some effect in retarding proper
legislation. Whatever Is done for the stim
ulation of shipbuilding and ship operating
should, of course, be done in such a way
that inducements would be the same for
all capital seeking investment in this
field.
While It is not likely that anything can
be done at the present session of congress
toward the furtherance of the canal
scheme. It is much to be regretted that
this matter was unnecessarily tied up for
a time by the last congress. The president,
remembering the reference of the subject
to a new and wholly unnecessary commit
slon, has nevertheless again called at
tention to the great Importance of the
project. But for the overwhelming amount
of labor ahead for congress, there would
seem to be a hope of disregarding the new
commission in order that the project might
the more speedily be entered upon. The
building of the merchant marine and the
construction of the connecting canal should
go hand In hand, and both projects should
have the hearty support of the whole
country not the support of one party only,
with more or less obstructive opposition
from other organizations.
GREAT ENGINEERING PROJECTS.
The greatest engineering projects which
were brought to completion In the nine
teenth century were the Suez canal and
the Pacific railroad. The two made possi
ble an almost direct line of travel around
the globe, seven-eighths of which is water
and one-eighth land.
However, as we are told by Mr. Walter
C. Hamm in the Cosmopolitan, the last
years of the century have been pregnant
of engineering proposals so vast that the
accomplished ones fade by comparison.
First and foremost, at least from our own
standpoint. Is the Nicaragua canal. That
this canal will be completed within a few
years no one can longer doubt. The Span
ish war gave it an Impetus that will not
be stayed until the work is fully finished
and ships are passing across the isthmus
from one ocean to the other.
Another great achievement in engineer
ing that is nearing completion Is the trans
Siberian railroad. It is believed that this
road sweeping across something like i.523
miles of Siberian and Manchurian desert,
will be open for public traffic by the be
ginning of 1903.
Another great railroad enterprise is the
English "Cape to Cairo" line. Of this, 1,311
miles have already been built from Cairo
southward, together with 1,373 miles from
Cape Town northward, leaving but 2.9ii0
miles to build In bridging the gap. The
engineering difficulties across this gap are
not half so difficult as those encountered
In building the Pacific railrpad, and a few
years are sure to see the line finished.
Then for the first time a single line of rail
road will span a whole continent across Its
longest way.
However, neither the Russian nor the
African lines are the most pretentious of
all that have been proposed. There has
been for some years a proposal before the
American people to bund the connecting
links which would complete a road length
wise across both of the American con
tinents. A few years ago a commission
was appointed by congress to investigate
the feasibility of this route and to make
preliminary surveys. The' report of this
commission was to the effect that a prac
ticable route might be found and that the
road could be completed at an outlay of
about $200,000,000. It was accompanied by a
map showing that by constructing 5,425
miles of track a continuous route could be
had from New York city to Buenos Ayres.
The whole distance between these places
Is 10,221 miles, but roads are already In
operation over 4,769 miles. The gaps to be
closed are 4C1 miles In Mexico, S21 In Guate
mala, San Salvador, Honduras, Nicaragua
and Costa Rico, 1,331 In Colombia, 633 In
Ecuador, 1,633 in Peru, 302 In Bolivia and 125
In Argentina. The difficulties are more
serious than In either the Siberian or Af
rican railroad, but It is believed that the
rewards would be commensurately greater.
Another bold railroad enterprise pro
posed is a line from London to Hong
Kong, though It has never been surveyed
and Is not an early possibility.
But an even bolder proposal once came
from the late ex-Governor Gilpin, of Col
orado. He proposed to unite the entire
railroad systems of Europe, Asia and
America by building a line through North
ern Siberia across Bering strait to Alaska
and thence down the British Columbia
coast to the Pacific roads now in opera
tion. "Bold as this scheme may seem,"
says Mr. Hamm, "there is really nothing
Impracticable about It. With the aid of
modern methods it presents fewer difficul
ties than the building of the Pacific roads
did in 1SC5. The only great obstacle to be
overcome Is Bering strait. The narrow
est part of the strait Is from Cape Prince
of Wales. In Alaska, to East Cape, In
Siberia, a distance of only forty-eight
miles. But almost exactly in the middle
lies the Island of Diomede, with an area
as large as Manhattan Island, New York.
If the depth of water at this part of the
strait Is, as claimed, only forty feet, with
a firm, solid bottom for piers, there are
no Insurmountable obstacles In the way
of the erection of a bridge from shore to
shore."
While we are planning to connect the
Atlantic and Pacific oceans, other coun'
tries are also scheming for new water
ways, France already has surveyed a
route by which the Atlantic ocean and
the Mediterranean can be connected across
her own domain. By using the rivers
Loire and Rhone, whose head waters arise
almost at the same spot, though running
off in different directions, a canal may be
constructed which will give entrance to
the Mediterranean far north of the Straits
of Gibraltar, thus dividing with England
the monopoly which' she now holds on the
nose of Spain. At the same time Russia
is planning for a canal from the Baltic to
the Black sea. She also has some rivers
which can be used in precisely the same
manner as the French rivers, and her en
gineers figure that such a water route
for the deepest draft ships would cost
only rrr.000,000. It Is not impossible that
within the nexttwenty-iive years England
will find two new entrances to the Med
iterranean, neither of which she can con
trol. '
It is worth while to consider these gi
gantic undertakings. They are not the
dreams of dreamers. Their magnitude is
not out of harmony with the spirit of the
age. The tremendous activities of the past
thirty years promise future achievements
even more bold and towering. The day
has dawned or is dawning when man will
master the reluctance of the t.eas, the
barriers of the earth, and the secrets of
tho skies.
President McKinley will be greatly crest
fallen when he receives his copy of the
Kansas City Times and finds that his mes
sage was "weak, bungling and defiant."
It was the president's fond hope that his
effort would please the esteemed Times.
In speaking of those who started the re
port that he was trying to intimidate the
state election board Governor Bradley use3
language that would sound rather start
ling from a high state official elsewhere
than in Kentucky.
It may be true, as a Boston writer says,
that the sad wail of the poor will be heard
as long as earth lasts, but happily the wail
of the political calamity howler is grow
ing weaker and less frequent.
Mr. Roberts, of Utah, Is getting some ad
vertising, but we hardly think he will
cash It In on the lecture platform. Eggs
will be much cheaper after the holidays.
The state election board In Kentucky Is
In no hurry. There is a large amount of
dynamite in the situation and the board
Is picking its steps very carefully.
With the aid of a negro and a torch,
Kentucky has made an early response to
Mr. McKlnley's remarks on the subject
of lynching.
It will probably be quite a little while be
fore the president's message is read and
digested In all parts of the national do
main. The surprising thing Is that Consul Mac
rum, an Ohio man, resigned, not that he
was succeeded by another Ohio man.
It is difficult to make a resignation ru
mor stick to a round, sleek, perspiring man
like Mr. Hanna.
Winter made a brilliant play, but Indian
summer seems to have regained possession
of the ball.
KAXSAS TOPICS.
Another Case of 1U to 1.
The Tagalogs of Kansas must have ex
perienced a double grief when they read
that account of how Lieutenant Monroe
with fifty men captured S00 Filipinos. The
Filipinos met defeat exactly at the ratio
of 16 to 1.
Elder Again to "Wield the Tripod."
It Is said that P. P. Elder is to resume
the editorship of the Ottawa Times. Let
us hope that the old man has reformed
from the status which he fixed for Jour
nalism when he swore In court that "us
editors sometimes lies."
Crowding the Limit.
There certainly is such a thing a3 carry
ing things to extremes. For example, the
universal determination In Kansas to lay
something by against a rainy day does not
justify that Fort Scott young woman who
swallowed a half dollar.
Should Have Emulated His Ancestor.
Mr. Plato Is suing for divorce at To
peka. He alleges that his wife Is not
what she ought to be and thathe made a
great mistake In marrying. Mr. Plato Is
not entitled to sympathy. If he hod curbed
his affection after the manner indicated
by his distinguished Greek ancestor he
would r.ot have had this trouble.

The Old Man's Life Sorrow.
Louis Martin is the name of an old col

and wide for his industry and his skill
in digging ditches. He is a plain old fel

life held a romance and a tragedy. AVhen
he was a slave In Missouri his young wife
was sold away from him, and he has never
ceased to grieve for her. He never mar
ried again and he talks about meeting his
first love on the shores beyond.
Wants $.'10,000 for Her Lcjr.
One day in 1SS3, Saber, the 2-year-old
daughter of Mr. Rouse, a section foreman
on the Frisco railroad in Cherokee coun
ty, wandered away from the house and lay
down on the railroad track. Soon she was
fast asleep, and she did not waken until
a freight train came along and cut off one
of her legs just below the knee. Nothing
was ever done in the way of holding the
railroad responsible for damages, and little
Saber grew into happy girlhood and then
attractive womanhood in spite of her sad
disfigurement. Just before the date of
her lbth birthday, however, she was
advised by someone to bring suit against
the railroad for damages, and last week
the attorneys of the company were notified
that action had been commenced in the
court of Cherokee county for $30,000.
Emporia's Vacant Brewery.
For ten years before the prohibitory law
went into effect Emporia had a large
brewery run by one T. H. Macke. The
establishment was located on the side of a
hill north of town and long cellars were
dug into the hill for storage places and
cooling rooms. With the coming of the
prohibitory law, however, Mr. Macke closed
the brewery, though he still resides with
his aged wife on the premises, and to this
day the place Is pointed out as one of the
sights of the town. Emporia is so good
and pure that naturally she shudders a
little when she presents this monument of
her former wickedness to a whilom
stranger, but nevertheless she feels for
it a little pride and a vast amount of in
terest. Indeed, the Gazette says that it is
quite thejeustomary thing for parties of
citizens to visit the place and poke around
the dark and noisome cellars, for which
privilege each person pays Mr. Macke 10
cents. The admittance fee also includes
the privilege of talking with Mr. Macke
about the days when Emporia was a sad
old dog; when she cocked her hat over her
left car and said the devil might take the
hindmost. Among the stories told by Mr.
Macke with great gusto is one about the
defeat of Governor Eskrldge for the legis
lature. Eskrldge had voted In the house
for the submission of the prohibitory
amendment to the people, and, naturally,
the brewery people were not pleased with
his action. So, when he appeared for re
election, Macke carried beer by the keg
down to the railroad station and gave it
out free to every voter. The opponent of
Governor Eskridge was a preacher and
probably he was as much In favor of pro
hibition as his rival, but Macke was after
vengeance and he got It. And so It passed
Into history that the only preacher ever
elected to the legislature from Lyon coun
ty got there through the Influence of free
beer a most shocking record, Indeed, for
a town so virtuous that it wouldn't let a
bandy-legged female dancer ragtime In a
tent at Its street fair.
Atchison's First Effort for a. School.
The death of F. G. Adams recalls to the
Atchison Globe the first attempt at estab
lishing a public school in Atchison. It was
in 1S3S and a meeting had been called to
vote on levying a school tax. Thirty-seven
men were present and the debate ran high
for some time. At last a vote was taken
and It stood thirty-two against the tax and
five for It, the five being F. G. Adams, L.
A. Alderson. Dr. Grime-, Clem Rohr and
I. N. Bridgeman. After the vote had been
announced F. G. Adams called for a di
vision in order that the friends and ene
mies of free schools might be known. It
was ordered that those In favor or the
tax should proceed to one side and stand
against the wall. While I. N. Bridgeman
was walking out to take his place In line
someone tapped him on the shoulder with
a cane. Bridgeman at once knock?d the
man down and a big fight followed, though
our historian does not say who licked.
Presumably, however, the five patriots
were roughly handled by the thirty-two
anti-taxers. The death of Adams leaves
just one of those five alive Mr. Clem
Rohr, of Atchison.
The Natives Alone to Blame.
As the stories of church desecration in
the Philippines are sifted out the onus in
each of them Is shifted to the natives.
The Catholic Monitor, of San Francisco
(the paper, which has been abusing Funs
ton), says it has in its possession a splen
did gold chalice brought' over by Private
John Wible, of the Ottawa company. In
the Twentieth Kansas, and It has the jus
tice to clear Mr. Wible from all blame.
He purchased the chalice from a Filipino,
not knowing its sacred use, but upon being
Informed he turned it over to the Catho
lic authorities at San Francisco. And this
reminds us that a well known lawyer in
Topeka has a solid gold figure of Christ
which he procured from one of the return
ing soldiers. Originally this gold figure
had been attached to a silver cross, but
the parts had beenseparated and the sol
dier did not get the cross. The value of
the figure (by weight) is $47. It was pur
chased by the soldier from a Filipino pris
oner captured at Malolos. The lawyer
in Topeka is a Catholic. He condemns, of
course, the desecration of the churches,
but he says no more blame Is to attach
to the soldier who purchased this relic
than to himself, who also purchased It.
To Topics he said yesterday: "When this
figure stood on the altar In a Philippines
church it was an emblem of worship and
religion, and the man who stripped it from
that altar was a desccrator. But, passing
from hand to hand, the crime of desecra
tion does not follow. It is now simply a
work of art, like that picture of the holy
mother hanging over there."
COXTEMPORARY COMMENT.
GasBlue St. Louis.
From the St- Louis Globe-Democrat.
The police law and the election law
fastened upon St. Louis by the last leg
islature are partisan measures wholly.
They can never rise higher than their in
tention. They were contrived to give Dem
ocrats ascendency in a city where they
have long had the fewest votes. Finding
themselves, year after year. In a minority
at the ballot bax, the Democrats of this
city went to the legislature and asked
and worked for the passage of these two
laws to beat the voters. All the perfumes
of Araby can not sweeten them. They were
dug up from the depths of Democratic
cunning to make the party machine su
perior to the ballot box. They fit together
perfectly, are two parts of the same thing.
The Democrats of St. Louis, beaten in
elections for ten years, and beaten worse
each successive year, demanded from a
Democratic legislature the succor of these
laws, looking solely to the advantage of a
beaten party. They got them, and will
use them to the utmost according to the
original design. The laws would never
have been passed but for this purpose.
The taint upon them Is Ineradicable.
When the citizens of St. Louis are no
tified that the state supreme court pro
nounces the police law constitutional and
facilitates the operation of the election
law they are reminded that the remedy
for such laws, subversive of all the fair
ness that should surround American cit
izenship, rests mainly with themselves.
The .people make legislatures, and when
authority of their own creation seeks to
deprive them of the rights of freemen,
the power of public opinion and of man
hood still remains. The ballot box can
not be struck down except among those
who are willing to be robbed of their lib
erties. Should all Impediments to these
two laws be removed, and they be put
In full operation, their rank injustice will
arouse general resentment and stern op
position. They were not framed to help
St. Louis, but to gag, pluck and degrade
It. When this workt begins citizens will
not stand by in indifference. They will
be the sufferers. It Is their votes that
will be shorn of thejr true weight and
value. It Is their money that will be
wasted by boards in whose selection they
have been deprived of a voice. The denial
of home rule, with a whole brood of con
sequent abuses, will, be a daily and hourly
reminder of the wrong Inflicted by this
party scheme.
Though it be pronounced constitutional
that a board appointed by the governor
may draw upon the municipal treasury
for an unlimited amount, .the people can
correct the" abuse. .Though all the elec
tion machinery of St. Louis be controlled
by Democrats, there? Is -still the .assurance
that .Goebellsm In St- Louis will be no
more successful thaji Goebellsm 'in Ken
tucky. The former' election law worked
equitably. It was cast aside because It
was' fair and registered the true will of
the people. What has taken Its place Is
part and parcel of the Democratic ma
chine. It is a gross abuse, but the people
are-not helpless 'under abuses. This Is the
main fact to remember, though the state
supreme court, rising for once above the
proverbial law's delay, finds no legal im
pediment as far as their decision extends.
Whatever course this matter may take,
the voters of St. Louis can not be perma
nently gagged and disfranchised.
Hard German Sense.
From the Chicago Inter Ocean.
The Milwaukee Herald by Its canvass
of representative German-American Re
publicans in every county of Wisconsin
ascertained that over 90 per cent of them
cordially support the president's policy In
the Philippines. This was a stunning blow
to the Bryanltes, who in the recent elec
tions in Iowa and Nebraska made special
efforts to win German-American support
and were loudly bragging of the alleged
eagerness of the German-Americans in
Wisconsin to rebuke the president. Now
the Chicago Chronicle learns that only
ten of the 117 German-American newspa
pers of Wisconsin support the ideas of
Schurz, Atkinson & Co. This is another
knockdown blow for the anti-expansionists.
The Chronicle attempts to soften these
sturdy German blows at the Agulnaldo
Aid Society by belittling the character and
influence of the German-American country
editors in Wisconsin. It points out that
one of the ten newspapers which support
Schurz' and oppose the president Is the
Germanla, of Milwaukee, which It alleges
has greater influence among German
Americans of the Northwest than all the
other German newspapers of Wisconsin
put together. The Chronicle then adds:
"It is a case of false pietenses to claim
that a large number of smnll country Ger
man newspapers, supported mostly by ad
ministration patronage, represent the opin
ions of the German-American masses as
against a metropolitan journal which has
a larger circulation and more powerful In
fluence on public opinion than all the small
fry put together."
The German-American editors of Wis
consin will know how to resent the Chron
icle's misrepresentation. The writer of
the paragraph quoted evidently knows
nothing of the real position and Influence
of the American "country" editor, whether
he write English or German. The fact is
that the editor of the average "country"
newspaper exercises a far more powerful
Influence upon his readers than the "metro
politan" editor can hope to obtain over city
readers. The insinuation that 107 Wiscon
sin German-American editors, according to
the Chronicle's own figures, are bribed by
"administration patronage" to suppress
their honest convictions Is as false as it
Is insulting.
Suppression of truth, garbling of facts,
and Imputation of sordid motives to all
who disagree with them are the ear
marks by which all men may know the
Agulnaldoltes. The anti-expansionists are
still dazed by the blows given them by the
German-Americans of WIscinsIn and Iowa.
Therefore they strike wildly and utter fool
ish words in their rage.
Our Xew Tropical Products.
From the New York Mall and Express.
The annual report of the secretary of
agriculture contains this year some In
teresting references to and suggestions
concerning the 'products of the soil in our
new island possessions. In one direction
particularly these are striking. We are no
longer strangers to the good work done
by the department In recent years through
the agency of experimental stations, of
which there are now forty-eight, 'and Sec
retary Wilson makes personal acknowledg
ment of the value of co-operation on the
part of the states, tending toward Increased
appreciation by the farmers and benefit to
their interests.
This experlmential work has already been
inaugurated in Alaska, and the secretary
urges that it be extended to Hawaii, Porto
Rico and the Philippines. The wisdom and
Importance cf the proposition are not far to
seek. Our Importations 'Of tropical products
now amount to more than $200,000,000 an
nually. These may, by proper study and
aid of the soil physicist, be confined al
most wholly to our own territory, with the
financial and Industrial benefit that this
must entail.
In the single Item of tropical plants, for
example, our Importations are valued at
about $200,000 more than four times as
much as the present total plant exports
of all the islands mentioned. There Is
reason to believe tha. they could be made

out, further, that the Philippines apparent

that are well worth congressional attention

but also, and Indeed primarily, to the

peace and contentment through enlarged

The Path of Safety.
From the Richmond (Vt.) Times
No reasonable . man will say that the
Times is unfriendly to the Democratic par
ty because It tells that party the truth.
It Is not Democracy that business men are
afraid of, for true Democracy so far from
being a menace to the country is a great
conservator of our institutions. It Is that
which holds Republicans In check and
guarantees popular government. But Bry
anlsm and free silver and Populism are
a terror to business men.
If In the year 1900 the Democratic party
should say through Its representatives in
the national convention that It did not
propose to overturn the financial system
of the country; that It did not propose to
repudiate the gold standard and adopt sil
ver monometallism; that it did not propose
to do anything which would disturb the
country's prosperity; If the party should
adopt any one of Its oldtime platforms,
business men would make 'themselves easy
and free, and from a business standpoint it
would make little difference to them which
national party prevailed. But when Mr.
Bryan goes through the country telling the
people that if the Democratic party shall
be successful In 1900 and If he shall be
elected to the presidency the party will
open the mints of the country to free sil
ver and carry into effect all the Popullstlc
and revolutionary measures of the Chicago
platform, any Indication of Mr. Bryan's
election upon such a platform as this were
scarcely less than a terror to business. Mr.
Bryan asks the people to swap the genuine
and assured prosperity which they have
for his visionary experiment, and the
whole business world would tremble If
there were any sign that the people were
going to do this thing.
With the Democratic party the path of
duty Is the path of safety. If the party
will only plant Itself squarely upon an old
time Democratic platform, forswear Popu
lism, and turn its back upon Populists, It
will at once regain the confidence which It
has lost.
A Remarkable Conversion.
From the Boston Herald (Ind. Dem.).
We have seen no conversion more re
markable in the recent transition state
of political affairs than that of Congress
man Sibley, of Pennsylvania. Mr. Sibley
Is a man of great wealth and considerable
intellectual capacity. He took the free
sllved disease in its most virulent form,
and has been nominated as the candidate
for president by some of its more extreme
Populist adherents, his position being that
of the Populists rather than of the Dem
ocrats. Yet Mr. 8ibley is now reported as
saying: "Free silver is no longer an Issue.
The great prosperity which the country Is
now enjoying ought to be evidence enough
to convince anybody that the financial pol
icy of the present administration Is all
right on that question." This man was
elected as a Democrat to congress a year
ago, yet he now declares also that the
president Is right In his policy of territorial
expansion. The two declarations together
look as If he were going over to the Re
publicans. A Setback for Populism.
From the New York Sun.
Populist legislatures, undertaking to re
duce to practice the theories of their party
platforms, have had to be taught by the
courts that there are such things in exist
ence as state and federal constitutional
limitations upon acts destructive of busi
ness and property rights. A stern lesson
of the sort Is again furnished to them In
the decision Just handed down by Judge
Hook In the United States district court at
Topeka. In the case of the Kansa3 "court
of visitation."
When, after the autumn elections In 1S0S,
It became evident that the heyday of Pop
ulism had passed, the Populist governor of
Kansas called an extra session of the old
legislature for the purpose of doing as
much harm as possible to the railroads,
telegraph and Insurance companies, and
other business corporations In the state,
before the new anti-Populist legislature
came in office. The old legislature met and
created an extraordinary body known a3
the "court of visitation," to which were
committed almost limitless powers of In
spection, control and punishment of many
of the corporations of the state. The old
state board of railroad commissioners was
swept away and both railroads and tele
graph companies were turned over to the
mercies of the new court of visitation. To
that body power was given to fix freight
and passenger railroad rates and telegraph
tolls and to appoint receivers and take con
trol of the property of corporations which
might disobey it.
Judge Hook holds that it Is evident, from
a mere cursory examination, that the rates
which the court of visitation Imposed were
less than the required services actuauy
cost, and that, accordingly, the law was of
the nature of an act of confiscation pure
and simple. He further decides that tue
legislature undertook to endow Its court of
visitation with judicial, legislative and ad
ministrative powers that are in gross vio
lation of the constitution, not only of Kan
sas, hut of the Unlteu otates also.
Of course, an appeal from this decision is
possible, but It Is not likely to be taken.
The Kansas people -have recovered their
sanity, .and it is questionable If there Is a
lawyer In the slate of sufficient prominence
to be consulted, who would advise the
Populist leaders that a successful attack
upon Judge Hook's decision could be made.
The decision Is a check and a warning to
Populists, whether of Kansas or of any
other state of the Union.
A Humorous Editor.
From the Boston Herald.
Mr. John Kendrlck Bangs Is encounter
ing the usual fate of people who are
famous for their excellent humor. Be
cause he has achieved a reputation as a
humorist there Is a good deal of aston
ishment at the announcement of his ap
pointment as editor of Harper's Weekly.
And yet the new manager of the Harper
establishment is popularly credited with
being a good Judge of talent, and the
chances are that he knew what he was
about when he designated Mr. Bangs
for the editorship of the Weekly. No
doubt he will achieve as marked a suc
cess In the editorial chair as It he were
a solemn prig who never smiled himself
or caused others to smile. As the editor
of the Harper publication called Lltera
aure Mr. Bangs has shown himself to
be possessed of sound judgment as well
as journalistic enterprise.
Too Severe a Test.
From the Chicago News.
Admiral Dewey, Governor Roosevelt and
General Funston are popularly ranked as
veritable heroes men who know not the
name of fear. It Is more than doubtful,
however. If any one of the three warriors
named could wear a silk hat past a crowd
of small boys in snowball time and not
look around to see if a volley impended.
New Foolklller Xeeded.
From the New York Mall and Express.
From the list of persons who have been
victimized by the swindling "syndicates" of
one sort or another it Is clear that this
year's crop of American fools Is somewhat
the greatest ever harvested. The returns
strengthen the belief that the foolklller Is
liable to Impeachment.
What Happened In Kansas.

From the Memphis Sclmltsr.
A good Joke which Representative John
Allen is supposed to have sprung on him
self during the recent Mississippi senate
campaign Is now going the rounds. He
Is reported to have been telling about a
visit to his old home, where he met one of
the old family servant's.
"Lawsy, Mars' John. I'se glad to see ye,"
said one old negress, "an so glad to know
dat you'se got yer same old poslshun."
"What's that?" asked Mr. Allen.
"Why, runnln fur office, o' co'se."

"Yes, the Bible's all right, all men are

"What makes you think so?"

THE WHIRLWIND ROAD.
The muses wrapped In mysteries ot light
Came In a rush ot music on the night:
And I was lifted wildly on quick wings.
And borne away Into the heart of things.
The dead doors of my being broke apart;
A wind ot rapture blew across the heart;
The Inward song ot worlds rang still and clear;
I felt the mystery the muses fear;
Yet they went swiftening on the ways untrod.
And hurled me breathless at the feet ot God.
I felt faint touches of the final Truth
Moments of trembling love, moments of youth.
A vision swept away the human wall;
Slowly I saw the meaning ot It all
Meaning of life and time and death and birth.
But cannot tell it to the men of earth.
X only point the way. and they must go
The whirlwind road ot song it they would know.
Charles Edwin Markham. In Scrlbner.
MOONLIGHT IX DECEMBER.
The moon above the eastern wood
Shone at Its full; tne hill range stood
Transfigured in the silver flood.
Its blown snows flashing cold and keen.
Dead white, save where some sharp ravlst
Took shadow, or the somber green
Of hemlocks turned to pitchy black
Against the whiteness at their baik.
For audi x world and such a night
Most fitting that unwarmlng light.
Which only seemed where'er It fell
To make the coldness visible.

A Story of General Dlx.
General John A. Dlx was a great stickler
for accurate quotation. In an address
which he delivered at Union college he ad
monished the students never to quote from
the dead languages without verifying.
That the general was accustomed to prac
tice what he preached In this particular Is
shown In an Incident which a friend of his
related. "Late one night In Albany." he
said, "while General Dix was governor he
rang my door bell. I was entertaining a
party of gentlemen and answered the bell
In person. The governor said that seeing
lights in my house hi had ventured to ring
because he wanted to look at Horace. Did
I happen to have a copy of Horace, that
I could conveniently lay my hands on? L
went to my library and found Horace and
handed It to the governor. He turned over
the pages, and, after a little, said: 'I was
reading In the executive chamber this
evening an article In which there was a
quotation from Horace. It occurred to me
that the quotation was not accurate, and I
find on examination of this volume that I
was right." "
A Coita Rican Table Delicacy.
"Down In Central America." said a for
mer New York man. back now on a lslt
from Costa Rica, the other day. "a fre
quent item on the menu Is monkey. I
want to tell you that a nice, tender young
monkey, roasted to the right turn, is a
dish fit for an epicure. At first I was
somewhat prejudiced against eating the
little animals that bear such a painful sem
blance of man. but I got bravely over that,
and now look on them very much as t
used to regard rabbits or opossums when X
lived In the States. You see. real good
meat Is a scarce thing In the Latin-American
countries, and how we yearn for a
juicy beefsteak, but yearn In vain. It may
be that If steaks had been plentiful I'd
have never tried monkey, but having had
the experience. I can give a sincere In
dorsement of the simian for food."
Handsome Christmas Gift.
The increase of the capital ot the Na
tional City Bank of New York from
$1,000,000 to $10,000,000 will make a nice plum
for the stockholders. Ot the $9,000,000 In
crease, 85 per cent Is to be allotted to the
stockholders pro rata, and paid for by
them at par. and the remaining 13 per
cent Is to be distributed among the new
directors, the recipients of It to pay for It
$130 per share, of which $50 will be divided
among the stockholders, and the other $100
paid Into the bank. At the market price
for the present stock of the bank, the
$10,000,000 to which the bank's capital will
be increased will be worth about $210, so
that the distribution of 15 per cent of the
additional $9,000,000. or. say. $l.KO.00O.
among the directors at $130, will work out
substantially a gift to them of $2,160,000.

Lieutenant C. C. Wood, of the North Lan

a great-grandson of President Zachary
Taylor, but not a grandson of Jefferson
Davis. Jefferson Davis married General
Taylor's daughter. Sarah. Dr. C. Wood
married General Taylor's- daughter, Ann
M., and the late Lieutenant C. C. Wood
was their grandson, his father having been

Last of Chlcaso's Pioneer Lawyers.
Judge Calvin DeWolf. who died last
week in Chicago, was the last survivor
of the pioneer bar of the city. He became
widely known In 1S60 through having issued
a warrant for the arrest ot a slave hunter
who was pursuing a runaway negro girl
who had taken refuge In Chlcrgo. For this
he was indicted for an offense "against
the peace and dignity of the United States."
but when Lincoln became president the
indictment was quashed. He was long
prominent among the anti-slavery people of
that section.
