I know it was proposed by certniu parties,
inasmuch as the Northwest was divided by

through all the Southern States, to have the
Northwestern States become an adjunct of
the Southern Confederacy. The people of

the words of the apostle, "Bless the Lord,

for the mercy and justice of God endureth
forevermore." (Applause.)
To my Democratic friends I would quote n
passage of Scripture (laughter), hut, of
course, the Senators are so familiar with
Scripture (renewed laughter), and thiscrowd
is su versed iu Scripture (laughter) that I
noed not quote it here, and I therefore con
tent myself with simply referring you to the
second chapter of the Ephesians, twelfth
verse, for the epitaph upon the De
party. (Applause.)
Speaker Colfax, and others—"Quote it."
Senator Yates—Oh! don't press me, please,
for I «un afraid I should fall short if 1 af
