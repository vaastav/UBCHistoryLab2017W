THE WE WS.
Apparently we now have the matter of the
result In Illinois and the complexion of oar
Legislature. An official correction by the
Clerk of Marion county amends an error of
one vole In the count, and gives Dr. Green,
Union candidate for the Slate Senate, two
majority over his Copperhead competitor,
Stephenson. This secures us two majority
in the Senate, and twenty Union majority on'
joint ballot.
From Colorado comes advices by a dispatch
-from Denver of yesterday, which brings an
inside and outside freight of good news from
the Indian war—outside, Inasmuch as, coming
os 11 did, it proves the wires working and the
redskins unable to maintain a break In the
communications across the Continent; Inside,
from the intelligence brought of an actual
handsome little vlotoiy over the copper-col
ored allies of the revolt, (strange what an
affinity the rebellion lias for copper,) wherein
our Colorado troops engage end defeat nearly
one thousand “salvages,” killing half of them
c.:;d capturing many horses and mules.
Our Cairo dispatch reports the rebel gueril
las swarming thickly on the Ohio and Mis*
dssippi Elvers, maintaining a considerable
annoyance to passing steamers. 4 *i-
Our "news from .Mexico comes through
French sources, and Is to be taken with many
grains of reservation. MaxhnUlian is, how
ever, undoubtedly strengthening his stakes
and doing everything in bis power in a
thoroughly Frenchy way to deepen his bold.
He has won a place in the history of affairs
on this continent, the ending whereof is not
so clear.
The members of the Probate Convention in
session at Springfield, yesterday, by the pas*
sage of the resolution offered by Judge Brad*
■well, of this city, dealt a staggering blow* at
the absurdity and Inhumanity of the infamous
Black Laws, in respect to the exclusion of the
testimony of colored persons from our courts*
Sheridan Is sweeping the Shenandoah clean
of the rebels,-and leaving nothing between
roving rebel bands and starvation. Oar dis
patches give fresh and signal proof of Ills
diligence and vigilance.
Richmond papers say Early got drank as
often as he was whipped. Our Phil.Sheridan
has much to answerfor then,’in making Jubal
Etu ly an habitaal-dnmkard.
Gold is stni uneasy, and has not heard from
Sherman. It is employing its period of sus
pense In the vicinity of 240.
Congress has passed a vote of thanks to the
gallaht naval heroes Captain Winslow, of the
Kcai surge, and the brave Lieut. Cushing, the
destroyer of the Albemarle.
We like the proposition to strike from the
rolls all unemployed officers. It Is a good
and sound mode of retrenchment. Put them
at work or restore them lo_ciril life.
There will be .universal satisfaction at any
measure of Congress punishing draft-sneaks
and skcdaddlcrs. The scriptural rule “ They
went out from us because they were not of
us” is excellent, and covers the whole case.
Denationalize the whole of them, and let them
creep back io citizenship through the same
processes that. arc appointed for all out
siders.
After an'experience of.meanness and illib
crallty utterly without a parallel in our rail
road annuls, the single track second class line
connecting Washington with Baltimore and
the North has become a doable track line.
Wo do not learn yet whether the company
have reached the polo'.of selling tickets to
places beyond Baltimore. The whole afialr
has been an Insult and a libel on our railroad
enterprise, a great hindrance to the Govern
ment, and a chronic nuisance to the traveling
community. With a double track, new roll
ing stock, and a new management, these
things when secured will help that Washing
ton branch materially.
OCR BRITISH COUSINS.
There was a great charitable Fair in Eng
land, patronized by that portion of the nobil
ity cud gentry who ardently favor tho de
struction of our institutions. It whs the
haunt of nil foreign emmissaries of the rebel
lion, end rebels resident abroad. The net
proceeds were seventeen thousand pounds,
nr about eighty-five thousand dollars in gold.
Figure it yourself, for the sum in greenbacks.
There was no end of gentle sympathy ex
pended on the gathering, and its details, and
the proceeds as above were all placed in the
baud* of a scion oCArislocracy, for a pur
pose. He made his appearance before Minis
ter Adams, with the most liberally rclreshiag
jnstance of British modesty we ever remem
ber to have read about, even in this war that
has given us so numerous a List of the kind.
It was the request of the British lord that
the sum in his hands be allowed to be die
bursed through an accredited rebel agent to
rebel prisoners in our hands. To the previ
ously recorded imputation upon ns, by the
hint that such on act was necessary, must
be added, with the tenderly charitable British
mind, ibc historic fact that Lord WharueUfle's
mission Is a clear failure. He is lert standing
a rejected solicitor with his seventeen thou
sand pounds burdening his hands, as it will
some day burden the scale into which we are
casting all these little items against Great
Britain. It was designed as a simple and un
adulterated insult to this Government.
The mantle of charity was stolen to
hide the weapon and Intents of
a deadly foe. It Is a clumsy, British invention
to start a connterlirc against the sickening
and accumulated stories of Southern prison
pens stuffed with our brave boys. It is an
attempt to fasten upon our Government the
same crime winch is one of the added weights
to the original enormity’ of this rebellion. We
hove shown the world the proofs of the
throngingotrocitics of Anderson; Hie and the
Richmond prison pens, and they will godown
into history with the annals of the rebellion,
.to live, long after it has met the fate to which
it liastcns.
The diplomatic correspondence, which *we
publish In our dispatches elsewhere, consti
tute a prompt and stinging rcbalic to these
British accomplices with the rebellion. Sec
retary Seward meets the question squarely,
turns all the points against the mission, and
its Intent, and sends Lord Wharncliffe hack
to his friends in disorder. We feed our pris
oners better than the rebel armies are fed,
and if Lee’s legions about Richmond winter
as comfortably as the caged but comfortable
crew in Camp Douglas, there will be no need
of rebel Sanitary Commissions. The British
rebel charitable fair is well rebuked, and the
•intention of the original donors will be best
srrved by applying the sum in Lord Wharn
cllflc’s noble keeping, upon the purchase of a
first class rebel pirate.
VXDB ON THE FLOBIDJLSEIZCBC*
We give in another column the pointed and
thoroughly American letter of our Minister
to Brazil, Hon. James Watson Webb, to the
Foreign Secretary of the Emperor of Brazil,
relative to the scizurd of the [Florida. Our
Minister could not have represented more
laithfully and emphatically than he has done
in this letter that pent up thunder of the
American people which will ere long make
every English chalk hill tremble from
John O’Groat’s to Land’s End. Eng
ine stands convicted to-day before
the world of being a nation of
pirates, and a perfidious and treacherous foe
to those very principles of liberty and pro*
gre-is. In her advocacy of which she Las been
so blatant, bullying vnd Pharisaical. The ac
count with England is getting long,and needs
settling. After ull that we have destroyed,she
has now at least three pirates on the seas
preying upon our commerce. There is no
concealing the fact that every dollar of dam
age thus done to ns must be ]>aid for by Great
Britain, if it has to be collected by sending
our £x hundred Monitors and gunboats into
the British Channel, and by sweeping British
commerce from the seas, which we arc pre
])orcd to do far more effectually than she has
vet fcmolisbcd our own. Diplomacy has for
four years tied our hands, while shfe has
reaeped the profits of piracy. It Is neither
consilient with .the interests, the honor or
the Intentions of the American Government
and people that finch a state of things shall
long conltnoe.

Mr. BROOKS, of N. T., said that the Secretary

The indications In the House on the whisky
tax lead to the expectation that the term of
levying the increased tax provided for by the
law of the last session will be changed from
February to January Ist, thus leaving loss
than three weeks until the tax will be £2 per
gallon. The cigar tax will be so amended as
to ratify the decision, of the Committee on

GEN. LOG AST
Gen. John A. Logan has arrived here, cn

fullest confidence in Sherman’s ability to
Teach the coast without any serious damage
to his army. We believe that Sherman is in

quently, both to rest bis men and destroy
rebel property and communications at the va
rious important points. This is the first time
General Logan has been in Washington since
he resigned his seat in Congress.
Three months’ pay is due him for services

John A. Logan was the reigning attraction

CHICAGO, JFIIIDA Y,DECEM BEli 9, 1861.
REPORT OF THE INDIAN BUREAU.
The following Is a statistical synopsis of
the report of the Commissioner of Indian Af
fairs:
At the present time there arc thirteen su
pcrihtendencica and fifty-eight agencies con
nected with the Indian service, and these
have the charge of about two hundred differ
ent tribes. The number of Indians actually
reported in the tables of population this year
is a little over one hundred thousand. The
number of Indians within the limits of the
United States is estimated at about 330,033.
The whole number of schools reported is
forty-seven, and the number of scholars fuur
•teen hundred and forty-eight. The 'tables
show that there hare been cultivated by the
Indians this year, J8,957 acres of land; and
by the Government, for and in connection
with the Indians, 2,078 acres, producing, in
the aggregate, 473,385 bushels of the products
of the field, an average of nearly five bushels of
vegetables and grain, to each of the 102,310
persons reported.
#ln addition to this, the Indians have made
during the past season, 432,471 2)9 sugar and
2,700 gallons sorghum syrup. Of fish sold
there were 3,067 bria.; furs valued at $37,537.
lie amount of wealth in individual property
owned by Indians is put down at $1,831,401.
With regard to the condition of the Indian
Trust Fund, no Important changes have been
made since the last report.
In connection with the above facts, it must
be taken into consideration that In-some of
the Superintend* nelcs, especially, the.South
ern, where, before the rebellion, the tribes
located south of * the Arkansas were
in a state of great prosperity, and far ad-‘
vaimrd in civilization,lint who have been for
the last two years exiles, from their homes,
scarcely anything has been done. The hos
tility which certain Northwestern tribes have
shown the last two years hare also interfered
materially with the progress in that quarter.
The following GoacniVOrderwos alsc* to-dnv
issued from the .Quartermaster General's of
lico:
Ibis Government has received Information
that numbers in the British provinces on our
northern border have removed there with the
intention of obtaining employment at depots
for military stores fur the purpose of incen
diarism. The plots by winch some months
since many stores on Western rivers were
fired and destroyed by rebel agents have
now been extended with the intention
to attempt the destruction of military stores,
shipping, manufactories and public and pri
vate property at various points throughout
the loyal States. The strictest vigilance,
and greatest care, should be enforced in
guarding ngalnst such fires.
Against persons who have at any time dur
ing the last six months been living in Cana
da ns icfbgees from' disloyal States, or fugi
tives from draft, officers of this Department
will require from those whom they may em
ploy at depots. In positions which could fa
cilitate access to stores or store-houses, sat
isfactory evidence, not only of loyaltv, hut

TSie Latest Situation at Nashville—
more UcconnolHftanccs Rumored
Rebel movement Northward-Hiub,
Surmise*' and Rumors*
[Special Dispatch to the Chicago Tribune.]
Nashville, Thursday, Dec 8, 1361.
The enemy’s lines still encircle the city.
T)ie general situation unchanged.
The feature of to-day was another reconuois
sance on our left, by colored troops, under
Col. T. J.'Moigan, the 14th Colored Infantry
and 16th Indiana (dismounted) Cavalry, and
GSth Indiana, commanded by Col. James Bid’
die.
About 11 p. m. they moved out of their in
trenchments, Morgan’s men on the left and
Biddle’s on the right. The enemy occupied
some works which bad been thrown up by
onr men and afterwards abandoned, near the
Murfreesboro turnpike, The fourteenth and
forty-fourth (colored) formed strong skirmish
lines with tho sixteenth and parts
of the two regiments I have named
as the second line, and 18th in ' reserve.
After pretty severe skirmishing the principal
line moved up, and, in company with the
IGth colored, on the right, drove the rebels
from part of their works. As the rebels
were seen massing tbeir forces to oppose
onr further progres,"Uic right and center
did not advance, and the whole line, in ac
cordance with orders, fell back, satisfied-that
the rebels on this part of our front were in
pretty stipng force. The CSth Indiana ad
vnneed simultaneously with tho colored
troops. The CSth had quite a gallant contest,
disturbing the rebels considerably, until they
were ordered to foil back. The colored brig
ade lost on man killed and eight wounded.
Col. Johnson of tho 44th was slightly
wounded.
Louisville, Thursday, Dec. B.—Yesterday’s
Nashville Rrtts says: Shelling the rebel
lines and their working parties, was kept up
on the 6th, but hardly so vigorously or per
sistently as the day before.
Forrest, with his command, is sold to he
across the Cumberland. We cannot vouch
for the truth of the statement, but give It as
we hear it.
The impression gains strength among both
fioldicrs and* citizens, that the Confederates
are evacuating. If this be bo, the march ou
Kentucky may be said to have commenced
We think it quite possible—indeed, probable.
A Nashville dispatch of last evening gives
the following news summary;
Matters at the front present no change
from that of several days previous. There
was less cannonading to-day than usual.
A sebel battery is established on the bluff
fourteen miles down the river, hast night
seven gunboats went down and engaged the
batteries, bat without dislodging them from
tbeir position. The boats returned yesterday
morning, one of them considerably'damaged.
A reconnoissance was made to-day by oar
forces between the Lebanon and Natanville
pikes. After proceeding a short distance the
enemy were discovered in considerable force.
Our Hoops charged opon the hill. which they
occupied, and drove them off. Two or three
men were killed and seveft severely wounded,
and a few slightly.
Colonel Johnson, who escaped from Block
house No. 3 so providentially, was slightly
wounded by a bmict of a rebel to-day.
Two prisoners were brought in hclwngmg to
Tennessee and Arkansas regiments.
A REBEL VIEW OF THE CAMPAIGN,
New Tore, Thursday, Dec. B. —The Rich
mond Scniinfl, of the 2d, says of the campaign
in Tennessee: It would be a small thing for
Forrest to do to swing around Nashville, and
cut its Northern communications. Hood has
probably but to place that city in bis rear to
frighten Thomas out •of it. *lt would seem
very clear that Hood has already accomp
lished enough to restore almost the whole of
Tennessee to onr side of the military lines.
He has but to march to East Tennessee to re-
Eiin complete possession there without a loss,
ost by the treachery of our commander at
Cumberland Gap, it may soon be ours again.
Isolated, cut off, and unsupported, Chatta
nooga would then become utterly untenant
able by the enemy. This would restore our
line of railway through Knoxville and Chat
tanooga to the southwest. The campaign
would, indeed, be glorious, that should close
with such advantage to our cause, and yet its
consummation seems within onr grasp. It may
be that Hood U striving for elUlmore; it may
be that Nashville is lobe regained, and that
the feet of his soldiers will press the soil of
Kenthcky, too, ere a halt U ordered.
Wc cherish large hopes from this enterprise,
hut trust that what Is now in our grasp will
not be too much imperiled in the effort at
more. If it shall please Heaven to favor us
with success which It now seems reasonable,
to expect in Tennessee, it will be an over-
whelming' rebate orßraguart Sherman, and a
hundred fold compensation for the pigs he
may steal and com cribs he may bum while
running the gauntlet in Georgia.

landed at Boyd’s Point* They then proceed
ed inland several miles, meeting with rebel
pickets only. The next morning the cuemy
appeared In force, on the road leading to Gru
hamfivllle, with cavalry, infantry and artille
ry. We advanced and drove them gradually
back to a.battery and intrenchmeuts, where
they made a stand, and a hot engagement of
seven hours ensued, during which* there was
charges and counter-charges, each side meet
ing with considerable loss. Night pufa atop
to fighting, the Hues on both sides remaining
the same. We took a few prisoners and lost
a few. Our casualties are variously estima
ted at from COO to 1,000. During the cv 'lug
wo fell tack a short distance nnpursued.
The steamer Trade Wind also brings a state
ment that the residents were still under arms
doing guard duty, in consequence of General
Foster having taken all the available troops
to co-operate with. Gen. Sherman, who wtv#
soon expected on the coast. A number of
Foster’s wounded had been brought to Hilton
Head, from'which place heavy firing could be
heard, and since then an advance was made
In other directions.
New Yohk, Thursday, Dec. B.—The Herald's
Washinaton special says: In addition to the
admissions of the Richmond papers of tfic sth
hist., that Gen. Sherman's main army had
reached Millcn, the authorities hare informa-
tion of unquestionable reliability that Sher
man's main army bad already passed MUlen
without a battle, and without expenditure of
any ammunition, except what was used in the
two or three skirmishes of detachments al
ready reported. Having passed MUlen, there
is no opportunity for a rebel force to inter
mpt his march to the coast for which be origi
nally set out, and where the supplies and
malls lor that command will arrive simul
taneously with it- The complete success of
Sherman's great enterprise is now beyond
doubt, and U has been demonstrated that all
that remains of the army of the rebellion is
compiled In the armies of Hood and Lee,
both of which will soon be rendered powerless.
- The Richmond Examiner of the sth says :
“ Sherman's army has parsed Millcn without
entering the town, and the column which has
been lingering for some time in tfaenelghbor
hood of Macon, has left the country, and
gone off to the main body.” It is unable to
say where the main body is»bi£ it presumes
ul* lu Uutoolumn frhlohlseaid w have passed
MUlen. Nether can it say where the main
body is going, but it believes Sherman is
making an speed for Brunswick, on the coast,,
and may reach there with some of his army,
but before he reaches blue water be will
probably have to fight one or two general
actions. 44 At any* rate the campaign is
drawing to a close, and the end will be Sher
man reaching the coast, or his defeat, or per
haps turrendcr at some point hear where he
is.”
The Richmond Dispatch of the sth says:
“It is not known where Sherman is. It is
not certain that he has yet reached Millcn,
though the fact is assumed. At four o'clock
in the afternoon, last Friday, the telegraph
operator at Milieu announced that Sherman
was within Tour .miles of the place. Nothing
has been heard from there since. He had
been within twenty miles of MUlen for. a
week.”
The Savannah of the Ist says:
“jThc whereabouts of Sherman’s main body
has been satisfactorily ascertained, and UU
movements of yesterday indicated anything
hut decision of purpose as to his destination.
The signs are that many people who have
been alarmed at the idea of his taking them
in his line of march will be agreeably disap
pointed.”
The Angnsta Chronide ol the SOth says: “It
most be confessed that for the past week
Sherman has successfully acted the part of an
artful dodger, confounding all calculations
and exciting general apprehension by his ec
'ccntric movements. The latest reports indi
cate that he Is moving towards the Savannah
river. He may turn upon Augusta and seek
to force bis way through South Carolina, or
he may push for Savannah or Brunswick.”
The Augusta Chronicle of tho Ist says: “It
Is reported that a party of Sherman’s scouts
visited Dtmara’s Ferry, on the Savannah riv
er, on Sunday. They remained In that vicini
ty, , taking observations. It is thought by
many that Sherman will endeavor to cross the
Savannah river at that point.”
The Savannah A'otj, of the 22th, says:
Sherman seems to be making no progress. He
is no nearer the coast than he was several
days ago. He appears to be hesitating and
acting us though he was caught in a bad box,
and don’t knowhow to get out. He is afraid
to go forward, and cannot go back. His men
and animals are tired and hungry,.with our
forces rapidly closing in around him. All
these things excite the liveliest hopes of his
utter destruction.
The Augusta ComliluthnaUst, of the 80th,
says : It is generally conceded that Sherman
is avoiding Doth Augusta and Macon, and
has gone on his winding way either to Savan
nah, Brunswick or Port Royal.
The Augusta Chronkk, 'of tho Ist, says :
Wheeler was still fighting the Fedcrals on
Wednesday. Results not known. W**cn
Wheeler struck Kilpatrick’s raiders at Big
Creek, they killed over 800 horses to prevent
them falling into Wheeler’s hands.
The Richmond Dispatch of tho sth cays:
“Dick Taylor has been put in command of
the rebel cavalry operating against Sherman.”
The August Chronicle of the BOth says: “It
is rumored that Wheeler, in the light at
Waynesboro, captured over 3,000 prisoners.”
The however, says: “.The
Yankee cavalry with whom Wheeler fought,.
numbered 1D0?*
The Richmond Whig says the rebels atGris
woldvllle captured the breastworks from the
Yankees.
The Macon TSegraph gays they charged
through an open field to within fifty yards of
the works, and then withdrew.
Hardee, under date of Grahamavtllc, De
cember 2d r claimed that he has repulsed Fos
ter on the railroad at that point, and olso a
force of marines under Admiral Dahigren at
Coosawatchic.
The Richmond Dtepakh says: “It is now
believed that Sherman’s objective point Is
Darien, and he has massed his forces va march
there. This is near the mouth of the Alta
huma. fifty miles south of Savannah.”
The Richmond Whig says: The Yankees ap
propriated over 2,000 horses and mules m
Gluscock and Warren counties.'
The Richmond JSsamincr of the sth says:
Foster undoubtedly thought Sherman near
Savannah when he advanced from Fort Roy
al to co-operate with him, but It, fonmately
for us, happened that Sherman was some forty
miles off.
The Richmond papers claim that Hood won
a victory at Franklin, cillug the fact that our
forces fell hack at night lo the defenses at
KashvUlc, as proof.
The Stntind reviews Sherman’s movements,
and hopes for the largest measures of success,
claiming that be had done nothing serious to
the Confederacy; that he will lose a large
portion of hie army, and hoa left Hood to win
successes in tfie West.

New Tore, Thursday, Dec. B.—A Frederick
dlsuatch says Sheridan is making a clean
sweep of the guerillas in the valley. He has
thrown hla forces out in the direction of Lees
bitnr about twelve miles from the river, and
Ims Moseby pretty well surrounded, as he baa
the river in his rear and Sheridan’s cavalry in
his front. He must move some way, and that

burned or otherwise destroyed, and in a few
davs it will be impossible for him to subsist
his cattle off the country which he infests.
Ibis must either drive Moscby north or south,
and as be can’t stay many hours north of the

nearer Richmond, where he can get supplies.

The Military Situation.
In the armies of the Potomac and James
picket firing is still kept up, and occasional
' exchanges between opposlnghatteries are all
that disturb the quiet. On Monday therewas
some) firing by the oth corps guns and the
rebels opposite, and between the Monitors
and-Hewlett House battery, but without
causing any casuallty on our side.
The 10th and 9th corps are consolidated,
■and arc known as the 24th corps, of which
Gen. Ord has assumed command.
The corps of colored troops, under General
Weitzel, is numerically designated the 25th
army corps.
Gen-Meade presented medals of honor to a
number of officers and privates of the 2d
corps on Tuesday-
Tne Heralds Washington special says many

bridge across the Fotomac, above the-rail
road bridge at Harper's Ferry, fell this p. m.,
while three Government teams were crossing
it. The pier in the centre of the bridge gave
way, precipitating the bridge and teams Into
the river.
Rebel New*.
The Augusta Constitution says: “ General
Sherman, with his artillery and infantry, went
to SandersTiliC-His van arrived there Sat or
day, the 20th, at noon, on the road two
days and a half from Millcageville. At this
rate it will take about seven days to reach
MiUenfrona Sandersville, or seventeen days to
reach Savannah. From the best authority
we learn that Gen. Kilpatrick commanded
the left wing of the enemy, which passed
along the country road from MUledgeville to
the Shoals of the Ogeechcc, where they camp
ed on Friday night. They burned the gin
houses and cotton, bat no cribs or houses,
and wc have no reliable Information of the
destruction of a single mill or factory in the
country, though they passed' several. They
took nearly all the horses and moles in the
country, and they scoured the swamps for all
the young negro men, and sometimes they
capturedvrhen they were not run off. The
enemy occupied Mflledgeville from Sunday
evening, the 20th, to Friday morning, the
25th. Their infantry and artillery made but
little advance. They left on Thursday morn
ing and met Ferguson’s cavalry, who drove
out their rear guard of cavalry oa Friday
morning. ' * ' '
The Augusta Register of the Sd says that
Wheeler has been fighting the enemy’s cav
alry Tor BC hoars. He commenced fighting
them In Jeflerson county, and has been har
rasslng them continually. Wheeler was in
close pursuit of them when they entered
Waynesboro, so close indeed that he was en
abled to extinguish the fire before the town
was much damaged.- The bridge over Briar
Creek has been repaired, and the trains will
run through as usual to Waynesboro. Gen.
Wayne occupies Milieu.
The enemy have not crossed the Savannah
River. There has been no enemy within ten
miles of the Georgia Railroad, and trains will
resume their schedules.
The Richmond S-ntind of the sth says infor
mation from otlicial and other sources seem
to indicate Sherman’s objective point is Da
rien, near the mouth of the AUamaha river,
50 miles South of Savannah.
The Augusta tenfold of the Ist says the
City Marshal of Atlanta will start on his way
homeward to-day, if he finds things all o.k.
We shall undoubtedly heretrom him in a few
davs. It will be welcome news to Atlanta
refugees to hear that they can return again
to their homes.
The Charleston ilf treury of the Ist gives the
particulars of tire fight at Grabaqisville, but
contains no new liters. It says; It may be 82t
down as a drawn battle, though in view of
the great disparity of numbers, the honors of
the day arc certainly due to the Confeder
ates.
The Augusta Chronicle of the - Ist says:
A 'gentleman from Sherman’s rear states that
hie line of march is market by dead animals,
broken wogons, bodies of men straggling,
ike.
When Wheeler struck Kilpatrick’s raiders,
at Big Check, they killed over 800 head of
horses to prevent their falling into his hands.
Trains run upon the Georgia railroad os fur as
Greensboro. The work ot repairing the road
to Atlanta will be shortly commenced It is
stated on reliable authority that the Yankees
appropriated over two thousand horses and
mules in Glascock and Warren.
Naval Matters.
The Dictator went into the lower bay Tues
day and fired fifteen rounds of shot and shell
to test the friction gear attached to her gun
carriages. Officers irom theressel say it gave
perfect satisfaction. No difficulty is now ex
perienced in steering.. She will leave during
the week, the weather permitting, for Hamp
ton Roads. ' , _ _ .
Latest reports indicate that Sherman Is
moving towards the Savannah River. There
is little reliance to be placed In any. indica
tion of his direction yet, till he shall get ont
of the triangle in which he has been maneu
vering since he left Atlanta. Wo can infer
nothing with certainty from his move
ments as to his ultimate course. He may
turn Augusta and seek to force Uls way
through South Carolina, or -he may pash for
Savannah or Brunswick.
The Richmond Whig sags: We have from
' the Georgia papers the particulars of a battle
with Howard’s corps at Qriswoldvillc, where
a Confederate force under Gen. Phillips at
tacked the enemy, about 12 o’clock on the
£°d lust. The enemy fell back a mile on the
Central Read, towards Savannah, 'where they
tad erected three lines of works. Phillips
pursued them to their breastworks, when he
ordered a charge, driving, the enemy from
the’r defenses. Tnc enemy made several des
perate efforts to recapture the works, but
were repulsed each time, losing heavily.

for an accredited agent to visit the Military
prisons within the Northern States, to dis
tribute aid to the inmates.’ He denies that
any political aid Is offered.br that any impu

rejoiced if effects of such sympathy could be
: extended to mlntakr to their' mental aid as
well as bodily suffering, thus contributing Ur

Mr. Seward replied as follows to the appli

US. SSWXRD’S LETTER,
Sir: I have received your dispatch of the ISth
November, together With fho-pnpers therein
Uoned, viz: A copy of a letter addressed to von'
on the 12th of November by Lord WharccllCe,.
and a copy of your answer to that letter. You
will now inform Lord W. that permission for tho
agent of the Commission desired by him to visit
the insurgents detained in the military prisons of
the United States, and to distribute among them
£17,000 in British gold, Is disallowed him.
It Is expected your correspondence with Lord
WharnclliTe will become public rending. And the
American public will be well aware that the Uni
ted.States have ample means for the seaport of
. prisoners, as well as for every other exigency of
war. The Insußrents woo have blindly rushed
Into that condition, arc suffering no privations
that appeal for reliefer chanty either at homo or
abroad. The American people trill be likely to
reflect that the sum thus Insidiously tendered os
of humanity, constitutes no large portion of tho
profits which its contributors maybe justly sup
posed to have derived from toe insurgents by
exchanging with them arms and munitions of
war for the cnltnre and production of immoral and
enervating slave labor. Nor will any portion of
the American people be disposed to regard the
sum thus ostentatiously offered for the relief of
'captured Insurgents os a too generous equivalent
for devastation and dissolution which this civil
war promised, and which, protected by British
subjects, has spread throughout the States which
before were eminently happy and prosperous.
. Finally, in view of this last ofllcioos Interven
tion in ourdomcstlc affairs, the American people
can hardly fall to recall the warning of the Father
of our Country, directed against great and inti
mately connected public dangers, viz: sectional
faction and foreign intrigue.
I don't think the insurgents have become de
based,'although they wandered from the ways of
loyalty and patriotism. 1 think, In common with
nil onr countrymen, they will rejoice In being
saved by their considerate government from the
grave insult which Lord TV. and his associates in
their zeal for the overthrow of tho United States,
have prepared for the. victims of this-unnatural
and heartless rebellion.
