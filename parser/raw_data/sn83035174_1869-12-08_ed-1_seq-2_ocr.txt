This husbiind rhad been guilty of a

Terrible Murder at Cardington:
On Thursday, (he 23th nit, be

citizens ot Cardiiigton were thrown in
to the wildest excitement by a report
that a well known citizen and busiue-s.-man
had deliberately murdered his

the facts, so J'ac as we have been able
to learn, are as follows :
A. F. McCnrdy, the father, had
been engaged in businass in Carding

years p:ist, and kept a number o
young women in bis employ as seam

Shortly after the breaking out of ih -rebellion,

Mujor of a Battalion of C.ivalry lie

20th year of his ago Youn McCur

On the morning, of the 25th ult., at
the breakfast . table. Major HjCurdy
and his wife bad an n.lteraiion n which
thy latter accused the Major of lieing
too intimate with, some nvom;in in bis
empioy, or wjio frequentel his ehop.
He denied the accusation and . called
his wife a liar.' . The son, fearing that
his father would resort to violence, in
j.rfi.) pLf'rtbPLPrntectirni aLki mnh-
is said that he became somewhat in
toxicated. Intending to go to.JFort

I he Wiul(l tm h i inset r. nnd nt nnra wpnUra
to the door and opened it. The faih-

er waved his hand and warned him
not t ei-ter or he would shoot him.
Without hcedinr threat of the father,
young McCurdy remained in the room
near . the door.. The father took a
uiith & Wesson revolver from a
drawer ami discharged the contents of
the. .chambers.. into . the. body of the
boy, which took elfeet a few "Inches
