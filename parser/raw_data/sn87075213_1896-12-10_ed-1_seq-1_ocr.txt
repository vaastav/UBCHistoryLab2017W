ANNUAL REPORT
Of tho Controller of the Cur
rency James H. Eckels.
Ho Makes Remedial Suggestions on
tbo Financial Stringency.
IMnces of I.pss Than 8,000 1'opulntlon to
Have National Dunks, With n Capital
Stock of Not Less Than 830,000
To Uu General Hanking lluslncss.
Washington, Dec. 0. Controller of
tho Currency Eckels has considerable
to say in his annual report about finan
cial stringency and congestion, and ho
makes remedial suggestions of inter
est. Various amendments to tho na
tional bank act, looking to giving re
lief, aro proposed by tho controller,
among them the following:
That in places having a population
of less than 2,000 inhabitants national
banks shall bo permitted, under regu
lations to be made by the controller of
the currency and approved by tho sec
rotary of tho treasury, to bo organ
ized with a capital stock of not less than
825,000, and with a corresponding re
duction in the amount of bonds required
to bo deposited with tho treasurer
of tho United States. That national
banks bo permitted undor such regula
tions and restrictions as shall bo mado
by the controller of tho currency and
approved by the secretary of tho treas
ury, to establish branch banks
in towns and villages where
no national banks aro establish
ed, and whero tho population
docs not exceed 1,000 inhabitants; such
branch banks to havo tho right to re
ceive deposits, make loans and dis
counts and buy and sell exchange, but
in no caso to be permitted to issuo cir
culating notes other than of the parent
bank.
Ho recommends "that legislation by
congress, based upon safe and prudent
lines, having in view the gradual pay
ment and cancellation of tho credit
currency now maintained by tho gov
ernment and the issuance hereafter of
all such currency through the
banks with full responsibility therefor
placed upon them, should bo had at
tho very earliest practicable moment.
The results which would follow such
enactments would be beneficial and
neither would monopoly be created nor
favor shown thereby."
AGAIN "DEAD."

Son Camts Itejolclng In 3l.iirld.
Madrid, Dec '.). The Havana corre
spondent of the Imparcial lias sent a
dispatch to that paxie'r which lias
caused rejoicing among the peoplo of
this city, who take it for granted that
the statements mado are true. Tho
correspondent claims that ho has
personally mado an investigation of
reports current in Havana of tho death
of Antonio Macco, second in command
of tho rebel army, and the son of Max
imo Gome.;, tho rebel commander-in-chief,
and found them to be true. In
official circles the report is accepted
with reserve.
It has already been officially an
nounced about six times that Antonio
Macco has been killed, and there have
been rumors innumcrablo to tho same
effect. Heretofore it has been tho cus
tom of tho Spanish officials in Havana
to announco tho death of Macco when
ever ho defeated tho Spaniards either
in strategy or open battle.
Madrid, Dec. 9. Tho government
learns from Havana that Maj. Cirufeda
sent a battalion of troops to San Quiu
tin Tuesday and obtained confirmation
of the death of Macco and young Go
mez, son of the rebel leader, Maximo
Gomez, tho dispatch adding that Gomez
committed suicide upon seeing Macco
dead.
Washington, Doc. 0. The Spanish
minister lni3 received a cablegram
from the Due of Tctuan, minister of
state at Madrid, which officially con
firms tho death of tho Leader Antonio
Macco, and the suicide of tho son of
Maximo Gome- Tho engagement is
characterized as a "glorious battle
fought by our troops."
BAD IMPRESSION
Created in Madrid by President Clovn
lnnd's Message.
Madrid, Dee. 0. Tho message of
President Cleveland to congress where
in lie treats of the Cuban question, has
created n bad impression in politi
cal circles and depressed tho
bom-se. In government circles great
reserve is maintained, none of the
officials displaying willingness to dis-
cuss the subject nt any length, though
some satisfaction is expressed that tho
message does not in any way advocate
tho absolute independence of Cuba and
does not support tho proposals to rec
ognize tho insurgentss a belligerents.
The opposition papers aro greatly
irritated by tho threat of intervention
on the part of tho United States unless
Spain speedily suppresses the rebellion.
They declare that Spain is fully able
to avert such action.
lho lidBcTfi Keith f:Tt..te.
Chicago, Dec. 0. Tho inventory of
tho ustato of Edson Keith, of Edson
Keith & Co., who rcceutly committed
suicide, was filed Tuesday. It is valued

insurance.

BOB FITZSIMMONS
Deprived of Ills Victory Through a Con
spiracy hy Sharkey and Ills Friends.
San Francisco, Dec. 9. It was ru
mored among tho knowing ones Tues
day night that George Allen, ono of
tho men who trained Tom Sharkoy for
his fight with Bob Fltzslmmons, had
mado a confession to tho effect that
Fltzsimmons was deprived of his vic
tory through a conspiracy.
It is stated that he has mado an affi
davit, naming Wyatt Earp, Dan. J.
Lynch, Tom Sharkoy and Dan Need
ham as tho prlmo movers in the plot.
Tho wholo schemo is Baid to havo been
hatched at Sharkey's training quarters
at Ocean Beach. It was arranged,
it is reported, that Sharkey was to
make it appear that he had been
fouled at somo point in the contest
when ho was in danger of losing from
Fitzsimmons' blows; further, that tho
signal was to bo given by Sharkoy,
who was to bend over and placo his
hand on his groin and at that moment
Necdham was to jump into tho ring
and claim a foul. Then tho referee
was to give tho decision in favor of
Sharkoy.
When seen Allen refused either to
affirm or deny the story of his connec
tion with the affair. Ho said: "I in
tended to sail for Australia on tno
next steamer, but tho turn affairs havo
taken will indefinitely postpone my
departure."
Col. II. I. Kownlskl, tho legal repre
sentative of Bob Fitzsimmons, has
brought suit directly against Tom
Sharkoy to recover 310,000 which tho
dofendant is alleged to be withholding
from the rightful owner.
"This action," explained Col. Kowal
ski, "can settle tho whole controversy
in short order. If Sharky, Earp, Lynch
and that clique aro in tho right thoy
can get in and prove it If they aro in
I the wrong they will bring up some
, technicality and cause delay.
"Wo will appear beforo Judge San
derson and produce our witnesses. Wo
I will show that there was u conspiracy,
by which Fitzsimmons was robbed of
510,000, and tho evidence we havo in
possession is overwhelming.
.IacUhuii'h Katul Day.
FliAMcroiiT, Ky., Dec. 9. Tho date
upon which Scott Jackson shall bo
hanged will bo fixed by Gov. Bradley
upon his return to the capital. The
day in all probability will be somo
Friday late in January or early in Feb
ruary. Should the Walling caso also
bo alfirmed, and that is the prediction
of the best attorneys familiar with tho
court of appeals, there is all likelihood
that the two murderers of 1'earl
Bryan will meet deatli upon tho same
scaffold at the same time.
In an interview Wednesday morning
Acting Gov. Worthington intimated
1 that if lie was called upon to act Scott
Jackson would not hang. He thinks
the punishment inflicted upon the two
young prisoners too severe. lie be
lieves that they did not intend to take
the life of Pearl Bryan.
New Coniot Discovered.

TURKETS FATE
Is Settled at Last by the Six
European Powers.
Tho Obdurate Sultan, Abdul Hamid
II., is to Bo Coerced.
Constantinople nnd tho Dardanelles Shall
Ho l'lnced Undur European l'rotectlon
Tho Forts Must Ho Dismantled
and 1'agsag lie Entirely Free.
London, Dee. 0. Turkey is to bo
coerced. Tho sultan is to bo reduced,
in fact, if not actually in name, to vas
salage. His fato will bo mado known
to him probably beforo the end of the
present week.
Russia, Franco and Great Britain has
decreed it. Should ho resist or fail to
bow at once to tho inevitable, then the
combined ileets of those threo powers
will enforce their behest.
Such, in brief, is tho infinitely wcl
como news which will bring relief and
a sense of restored self-respect to tho
whole Christian world. It is not offi
cially announced yet. It may oven bo
discredited in certain quarters for a
few hours as premature. But it can
be affirmed, nevertheless, without res
ervation. It was not until Tuesday that tho
full consummation was reached. Rus
sia, France and Great Britain arrived
at a substantial agreement on a plan
of action last week. Thero remained
tho necessity of gotting tho consent of
the other threo powers which were
signatories of the Berlin convention,
Italy and Germany agreed without
much demur. Austria hesitated long,
and it was not until after Tuesday's
emergency cabinet council in London,
which discussed and approved the
wholo plan, that the Austrian ambas
sador notified Lord Salisbury of the
rather unwilling assent of the govern
ment that the Russian, French and
British iloets shall forco the Darda
nelles, if necessary, in the execution of
tho new policy.
The solution of tho Turkish problem
provides nothing so radical as a divis
ion of tho Turkish empire. Such a
project has not been for a moment
considered. Tho integrity of Turkey
will be substantially maintained.
Tho terms of the new policy havo
practically been dictated by Russia.
There aro two or three versions in
diplomatic circles of the policy at last
decided upon. This is one:
That Russia shall occupy tho north
eastern corner formed by the Bos
porus nnd tho Black sea and extend
ing to a point about half way down
tho Bosporus; that Constantinople and
tho Dardanelles shall bs placed under
European protection, but shall remain
under tho rule of the sultan, the forts
at the Dardanelles being dismantled
and the passage becoming entirely
free. No further change is suggested
in regard to tho integrity of tho Turk
ish empire.
Thi3 includes also European super
vision of somo of tho faultan's appoint
ments. SPANISH CABINET
Holds n Meeting for the Consideration of
i'rcsldcnt Cleveland's Message.
Madrid, Dee. 9. Tho Horaldo says:
Tho cabinet hold a meeting Wednesday
for tho purpose of considering I'rcsl
dcnt Cleveland's message to congress.
E.-Profnior Sagasta declared that tho
message is cf so much importance that
he will nail the receipt of tho full text
of the document beforo discussing it.
Some of the Spanish newspapers dc
claro that tho message provokes Eu
rope not Spain alone.
Tho general opinion hero is that the
references to Cuba and Spain contained
in President Cleveland's message to
congress show that it is the intention
of the United States to conform moro
and moro to tho Monroe doctrine every
time a caso arises to which that princi
ple is applicable.
Tho cabinet, after debating tho text
of the messngo Wednesday, will form
some definite judgment, which it is be
lieved will result in a modification of
the relations of Spain with the United
States.
Tho Heraldo says that tho presi
dent's message foreshadows tho inter
vention of tho United States in Cuba in
March next, but adds that Spain will
repel tho arrogaueo of tho American
government.
