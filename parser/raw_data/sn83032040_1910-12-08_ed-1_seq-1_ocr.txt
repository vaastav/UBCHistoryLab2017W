CRAVEN.
CHARLES C. CRAVBN, aged 78 y earß,
one month and one day, died at his
home at Sterling Run, Tuesday, Nov.
29th, 1910, after an illness of four days.
On Saturday he was stricken with
paralysis, from which he never rallied.
His death is a great loss to his town,
where he has for 18 years resided and
has been universally respected.
Charles C Craven was born at Jer- '
sey Shore, Oct. 28, 1832. He was mar- j
ried to Martha Walbrook, of York
Stale, August (i, 1853, and came to Em- :
porium in the year of 1856, and resided I
there until 1893, when he moved to
Sterling Run. He was one of the char
ter members of the Methodist Episco
pal Church, ol Emporium, and a true
helpor in the church at Sterling Run.
He was courteous, unassuming, a good
neighbor and a blessing to his home.
The funeral was held at his home,
Friday morning. Rev. Chas Lehman
officiated, assisted by Rev. S. F. Eber
sole. The text was taken from Zacha
riah, 14th chapter, verse 7: "In the

Eye Injured.
Ijist Friday afternoon, while attend
ing to his duties at the Emporium Iron
Company's works, Mr. Rosa Overturf
had the misfortune to injure his right
eye, by being hit with a piece of iron.
Dr. II S. Falk dressed the injury and
Mr. Overturf went to Ridgway on the
evening train to consult a specialist.
On Saturday he submitted to an opera
tion and possibly will have another
within a few days. The sight of the
eye will probably he restored. We *ire
profoundly sorry for Mr. Overturf ami
sincerely hope the operation will
prove successful.

WASHINGTON LETTER.
| Prom our Regular Correspondent.!
WASHINGTON, Dec. 1910.
After a recess and au election event
ful in American politics, the national
legislature is again in session in Wash
ington. It will be a full year, however,
before the result of the recent elections
can be felt in legislation, and by that
time there may be such changes in
commercial, industrial and political
conditions that the intention of the
voters as expressed a few weeks ago
will be modified or in some instances
nullified. It is an unfortunate condi
tion that twelve months must elapse
and a session of Congress intervene
before the will of the country as ex
pressed at the polls can be carried into j
efl'ect, and when it is remembered that
this condition is fixed in the conatitu- }
tion, that fetish of the American law
yer and statesman, it is difficult to see j
how reform can be effected.
It is expected that the present ses- j
sion will address itself to routine busi- j
ness, the passage of appropriation
bills and necessary non-political meas- I
ures. The President's proclamation !
has recommended as a matter of course
important new legislation, but there is ]
little prospect of its being carried out.
Nothing much will be done until after
the Christmas holidays, and then bare
two months of the Congressional ses
sion wiil remain before this Congress,
on the 4th of March, will be ex-oftlcio,
and, as has been said, the new Con
gress just elected to do and undo BO'
much will not have its chance for (
twelve months.
Among the messages that will surely j
have a hearing in the discussions under ,
the appropriations bills will be the sub- j
ject of the fortification of the Pauama !
Canal and there will be a confusion i
of party lines in the debate on this j
question. Some Republicans and 1
some Democrats will oppose the mili- j
tary program proposed by the Presi- j
dent, while other Republicans aud j
Democrats will likely approve it. Mr.
Tawney, Chairman of the appropria
tions committee, who failed of reflec- !
tion, will urge that the Canal shall be
made a free waterway, unguarded by
fortresses or cannon, while those of
the Roosevelt and Taft school of poli
tics will insist that a property costing
nearly half a billion dollars and essen
tial to the defence of our extensive
western coast shall not be left without
adequate military protection, always,
: of course, "in tne interest of peace," as
Mr. Roosevelt would express it.
There is much comment in Wash
-1 ington with regard to the almost op
pressive silence of Mr. Roosevelt since
the election. Helms completely dis
appeared from the (silitical firmament,
and now instead of heauliue« and col
umns on the first pagee ef the daily
papers, there is not even a paragraph
• >ra caricature. The explanation is
that he has probably given u tip to his
friends, the reporters aud caricaturists
I for between him and them there has
b»-en n loya!ty mutu.il »nd Ideal) that
they shall give him an indetln.:. term
ofexchiaite privacy, it would not l>e
bad for Mr. Rooaevelt's political fu
itureif he should let his heard grow,
take the Canadian route to Vancouver,
sail on the Empress of India line to
Yokahoma, and n|>eml the next two
years in Japan, China, the Philippines,
Java, Straits Settlements and India,
returning to this country in time to
mix in next Presidential election, ei
ther as principal or assistant. Travel,
otmcrvation and meditation will lie
good for even so well equipped a man
as the only ex President of the failed
States.

EMPORIUM, PA., THURSDAY.DECEMBER S, 1910.
Big Fire at St. Marys.
This (Thursday) morning at about
4:45 o'clock a most disastrous tire
broke oat ou Erie Avenue at St Marys,
which totally destroyed six buildings,
among which were the Commercial
Hotel, a barber shop, bakery and three
other buildings The origin of the
fire is unknown. The flames spread
rapidly and aid was called from Ridg
way, Dußois and Itenovo, all places
responding. Train No. 12, due in Em
porium at eight o'clock, wae held out
side St Marys yards, as the fire and
heat was so intense that it was impos
sible to bring the train through. It ar
rived in Emporium one hour late. We
have not learned at this writing the
amount of the loss, but it will probably
be quite heavy.
LATER:—A later report from St.
Marys to the PRESS in regard to the
fire, is as follows: The Commercial
Hotel is only partially burned; Baker's
Clothing Store, (it was here where the
fire started), the Family Theatre,
Evan's barber shop, Venaui's fruit
store, Luke's Bakery and pool room
are all destroyed. Owing to wire com
munications being very poor we can
not give a detailed account of the loss
or insurance.
Watterson Still a Free-Trader.
"No less than of old we fly and shall
continue to fly the flag of a Tariff for
revenue only. No less than of old we
assert and shall continue to assert that
the government has no right, in law
or equity, to levy and collect a dollar
of taxation except for its own support.
No less than of old we proclaim and
shall continue to proclaim the truth
that Protection is robbery under the
form of law." That sounds like Henry
Watterson, and it is Heury Watterson,
in double-leaded editorial in the Louis
ville Courier-Journal. Moreover, it is
the voice of the Democratic party. For
tunately for the country, perhaps,
while all Democrats theoretically ac
cept that platform, many of them balk
at its practical application when the
interests and productions of their dis
tricts and state are concerned. Never
theless, it shows what the country
would be entitled to expect should the
1 Democracy again get complete control
of the government. And then, once
more, the deluge. -Rochester Demo-

New Fire Nozzles.
Chief Engineer, A. M. Haupt, has
received three new fire nozzles for Em
porium fire companies that are dan
dies. They were tested, Monday eve
ning and were very satisfactory,
throwing a nice stream over the Bap
tist Church tower. The Emporium
Water Company's pressure was 140
pounds. Right here we should like to
know why Emporium, with its excel
lent fire protection, should be charged
such outrageous insurance rates.

President's Message.
President Taft's message was pre
sented to Congress on Tuesday. He
deals very plainly with the leading
questions of the day. He strongly
urges economy and the enlargement
of opportunity for foreign trade;
abolishing of all needless ship yards
and custom districts; expand Jonr op
portunities in the markets of the world.
The present tariff as au income pro
ducing measure has never been ex
ceeded in the history of this country.
The present tariff law schedules have
been grossly misrepresented. He
urges that tariff legislation be left to
the new Congress and strongly advo
cates a tariff board; that there should
be no halt to business; the schedules
be acted upon as the occasion arises.
The Panama canal which will be com
pleted Jan. 1, 1915, within the estimate
of cost,§,' 175,000,000, he urges fortifica
tion and we believe he is right. Postal
Savings Banks and Parcels Post he
strongly endorses, the latter to extend
to the Rural Routes. The message we
regret is too lenghty for us to handle
this issue.
The Census.
While Cameron county has only
gained in population 596 during the
past ten years, making our total popu
lation 7,644, we have cause to rejoice
when many of our neighboring coun
ties have gone backwards. Here's
hoping that during the next ten years
our county may be dotted with more
industries, thereby increasing our
population.
We have not been furnished the
figures for Emporium and Driftwood.
Possibly Driftwood will hold its own
and we look for Emporium's popula
tion to be 3,000, possibly 3,200.
Council Brothers.
Chas. A. Counsil, senior member of
the general merchandise firm of Counsil
Brothers, Sinnamahoning, Pa., trans
acted business in Emporium yesterday,
making the PRESS a social and business
call. This enterprising firm has just
completed a solid brick building, situ
ated near the iron bridge leading to
Wyside. The opening of the new
store, which will he a gola day for
Grove, takes place on Wednesday,
Dec . 14. Read their ad in this issue.
Successful Operation.
Dr. F. Q. Early, of Ridgway, Pa.,
and Mrs. Linn, Matron of Ridgway
Hospital, accompanied u Ridgway
patient to the otlice of Dr. lleilman,
at this place for the removal of a
cancer by means of electric needles.
The Doctor assures us that when
cancers are removed by this method
they seldom return.

DON'T LOSE TIME.
One of the most successful men of America
when asked to what he attributed his success re
plied:
"I built my fortune on the dial of my watch
seconds became pennies, minutes became dimes,
hours became dollars. I gave a money value to
every tick, and took advantage of everything
that economized time. I never procrastinate;
I never wait for other people to get ahead of me.
I keep my eyes and ears open for opportunities;
I look well into whatever seeuis good to me;
when ray judgement approves I act promptly
and with decision. I don't know that there is
any particular rule or law of success, but I'm
pretty sure that one ol the foundation principles
is "Don't lose Time." Don't lose lime in open
