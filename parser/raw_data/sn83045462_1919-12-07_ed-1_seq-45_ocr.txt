DEMUR TO SEPARATE
SERVICE FOR AIRMEN
Naval Experts Explain Why Flyers, How
ever Competent, Cannot Hope to Com
pete With Army and Navy Officers.
BY R? M. KAFFFMANN.
rhe duties Of a naval aviator in
clude those of a naval officer. Any
flyer detailed to co-operate with the
Navy in war operations by a sepa
-ate and distinct department of aero
nautics. such as is contemplated in
legislation submitted to Congress, no
matter how competent or how daring,
would not be a naval officer and
hence would not do.
The foregoing statement sets fort
the principal objection prevailing
among American naval officers to any
such separate department, ranking
with the Army and Navy as an
agency of offense and defense and
relieving both arms of their aeria'
duties.
A naval officer can be. and some
times is. an aviator, but the converse
Is not true. A flyer furnished for
naval service by a third branch, advo
cated in. some quarters, would not be
primarily a naval officer, with corre
aponding limitations on his useful
ness. As one English officer har
put It:
Airman Eltfcer. Bat Kever Both.
"A soldier is a soldier and a sailor
t? a sailor, and what Is called an 'air
man' may be either, but he cannot
possibly be both." .
There are other Interesting views
held in naval circles, not all of which,
with their underlying reasons, have
been given publicity. Naval officers
have plenty of additional objections,
based on certain specific administra
tive and technical angles of the plan.
Wearers of the blue and gold do not
concern themselves greatly with how
the Army feels about it, although
claiming that only a part of the land
forces favor the project. What they
are looking out for is the United
States Navy and its chances of suc
cess in the next war. They consider
their branch as the first and most es
sential line of defense, and no mat
ter what arrangements obtain for
the Army, they want the responsi
bility and the glory of doing their
own job in their own way. They j
want only their own men on that job
running their ships on the surface
their submarines under the surface
and their aircraft in the air above the
surface. . _ ^
Won Id Be Flak Out of Water.
As one man stationed here, himself
not a fiver, although keenly inter
ested in flying, has put it:
? An aviator detailfd to the fleet for
temporary duty from a department of
aeronautics would be a flsh out o
water."
That practically all naval officers
are adverse to the separate depart
ment scheme has been testified to by
no less a person than Franklin D.
Roosevelt, the assistant secretary of
the Navy. At a recent hearing before
the Senate military affairs committee
which was considering the Senate bill
creating the third arm. he said:
"Not only the Navy Department of
ficially. but the entire naval service
is absolutely opposed to the creation j
of another and separate branch of
national defense."
He was corroborated y \ ice Ad
miral H. P- Jones. His declaration
is borne out by naval officers sta
tioned here, from the highest to tho
lowest ranks, and representing both
line and staff.
?lmllari?y of Seutlmeuts.
There are. of course, a few excep
tions The%reader. however, can sat
isfy himself of the percentage by
r.sking every naval officer he knows.
He will be surprised at the sameness
of the sentiments expressed, although
perhaps the reasons given may vary.
And, what is most to the point, among
the irost determined opponents of
any scheme to take away from the
Navy Its flyers, equipment and de
signers of that equipment, are those
very men who. having specialized in
flying and kindred subjects, would be
the ones almost certain to benefit,
hoth in increased rank, increased pay
increased authority and increased
jrominence. should this plan go into
effect. That's a pretty good test of
the sincerity of their convictions.
Admiral Mayo and Admiral Sims
have both stated that the aircraft
force must not only be in. but of. the
fleet and subject to the orders of the
fleet's commander. In order prop
erly to work under his orderB the
personnel must be trained and indoc
trinai.?i by him in time of. peace.
Naval Aviator Requirements.
"The naval aviator." says one ex
perienced officer, "must be trained in
the control of the fire of turret guns
at sea: in the tactical formations used
by fleets and in th. correct estimation
of probable intentions from the die
position of the enemy fleet. To a man
high up in the air. ships look remark
aulv alike. It is not easy, even for a
regular naval officer, to distinguish
between a battleship and a cruiser, a
cruiser and a destroyer, etc. When
the commander of a fleet send* up air
craft, either for observation or at
tacking purpose, he wants them man
ned by men trained to see things
fmm the standpoint of a sailor, to
make reports from that same stand
point and to fight with purposes and
results peculiar to naval training.
There are other angles to the ques
tion. angles that are deemed political,
both as regards national politics and
Army politics. Concerning them
naval officers express themselves with
the utmost frankness. They don't like
the underlying causes of the move
ment for a third service any more
than they fancy its inevitable evil re
sults.
t all rropagnnda Innplred.
"Inspired, if not inspiring." is a
phrase use* by them concerning state
ments to the general effect that the
Army air service has been "shot to
pieccs" either by Congress or the gen
era! staff: that the naval air service,
worthless before, is now also wrecked;
that the Post Office Department can
not properly run its own air mail: that
commercial aviation is in a chaotic
state because of lack of government
control, and. finally, that the only
hope of setting matters right is a new
and great department of the air which
will run the air fleets of the future
independently of the hampering con
trol of a Pershing or a Sims. Such
propaganda they characterize as "bunk." I
Somebody greatly desires this new air |
department, they point out. and inquire
as to who is benefited by It. Well, these
are the people whom naval officers in
dict. First, all the Army aviators who
are to lose their present temporary high
rank?"boy colonels" who see a good
chance still higher and spreading their
plumage as "boy generals."
Disloyalty to Superiors.
These men. claiming to be misunder
stood and hindered by the general staff,
head of the department of military
aeronautics, etc., are nothing more nor
less than disloyal to their superiors and
are trying to maneuver themselves into
positions wherein they will be responsi
ble to no one but themselves. Naval
flyers and naval aircraft men are par
ticularly intolerant of any such attitude
and are unanimous in placing the effi
ciency of their arm of service before any I
possible individual advancement,- were
they incorporated into the third service.
To sum up, they don't like the way I
these Army men are working, and they |
have no great admiration for the men [
themselves.
Next come, they say, the Manufac
turers' Aircraft Association and the |
flock of trade papers supported by that
association. All this group see in a
third service, with a great program,
glittering prospects of renewing and
even extending war-time profits. TheTr
keen interest in the matter is evidenced
by the fact that they maintain repre
sentatives at the National Capital work
ing tooth and nail for the new "depart
ment."
for Political Aggrandisement.
Lastly come a few men influenced by I
political aggrandizement. Heading this |
contingent is Senator Harry New of In
diana. He sees, sailors claim, a chance
to have his name associated with a piece
of successful legislation of the first or
! der?something he has never been able
I to accomplish. Naval officers generally
grant his sincerity In the matter. He
thinks the bill a good one. His own de
sires and beliefs, they claim, have been
played upon by others who are not sin
I cere, but who speak with an apparent
i authority due to military uniforms and ]
! combat experience. Owlnf to the In
| diana. statesman's brains, political
acumen and energy, naval men highly
regret Senator New's advocacy of the
plan. (
Naval officers find comfort in the
fact that those who have aligned
themselves against the new scheme
include Secretaries Baker and Daniels.
Gen. Pershing, the general staff of |
the Army, the general board of the
Navy, the director of military aero
nautics. the director of navallaviation.
practically all of the Army except the
| aviators and all fhe Navy, including
the aviators. Yet the weight of these
opinions, they fear, may not be able
to ofTset the potent political, com
mercial and personal influences lined
up on the other side.
Gen. Pershing's Position.
Gen. Pershing was flrst credited
with having announced himself &? in
favor of the third service. This came
about through interruptions at hts
testimony delivered before the Senate
and House military affairs commit
tees, whereby his affirmatives and
negatives were misapplied. When his
written statement was published it
became apparent at a glance that Gen.
Pershing had added fhe weight of his
adverse opinion to Secretary Baker's.
Naval officers say the whole scheme
is rooted in an Army fuss. Trouble
started between officers of the Army
air service and the g?neral staff when
the former attempted to secure greater
recognition of service and authority to
! expand at the expense of other Army
branches. The air service men lost out,
but were not discouraged, for with Eng
land's example before them they saw
a way still open to gain their ends.
Under the leadership of Brig. Gen.
William Mitchell, they are working for
the establishment of a separate de
partment which would give them every
thing they desired, and more?high
I rank, high pay, prominence, authority
I and independence. For their own sake,
admit the naval men, one might be In
clined to wish them success, but for one '
thing, and that is that to accomplish
their scheme at ail they will have to
drag the Navy along.
(in. Mitchell's Views.
' At a hearing before the House com
| mittee on military affair? Gen. Mitch
ell. when asked as to his knowledge
of how the Navy aviation forces felt
concerning the proposed legislation,
said:
"I think the flying personnel of na
val aviation are really in favor of it.
They hesitate to express their opin
ions because they are all junior offi
cers and because the seniors, them
selves not flying officers, are against
it. largely. 1 believe, from lack of fa
miliarity with the subject."
Naval officers contend that Gen.
i Mitchell is entirely wrong, twice in
1 one short paragraph. The flying per
| sonnet of the Navy are not in favor;
J they are dead against. And the senior
? officers are not opposed because of
jany lack of familiarity, but the very
opposite. They consider the scheme
fallacious in conception and unwork
able in practice.
The claim has been advanced that
a separate air service will mean an
avoidance of duplication of methods
and agencies now obtaining in the

THE purpose of this article, and of those
that are to follow It, from week to
to week, is to enable Jim and Jane,
average American man and woman,
to sit down together of a Sunday
morning and review the more impor
tant phases of the week's news. This review
should occupy a maximum period of half an
hour. If, at the end of that time, Jim and
Jane can say to each other and to the world
in general, "Well, I've got that straight," before
he turns to the sporting section and she to the

have been accomplished. Better still, if t)iey

Up on Capitol Hill the gavels of the Vice
President and Speaker Gillett have called the
first regular meeting of the Sixty-sixth Con
gress to order, as from December 1. It is to
be hoped that congressional hands have been
moistened and congressional shirt sleeves rolled
|ip. in the manner popularly betokening a deter
mination to clean up the job on hand in short
order. The country needs a demonstration of
getting down to work. Senator Sorghum and
his junior conferere in the lower house can fur
nish the needed example.
For there's work for them and plenty of it.
There's the usual congressional card, including
such vital matters as the railroad and merchant
marine measures, immigration, the tariff, the
Army and Navy bills, a national budget system
and appropriations to meet very largely in
creased national needs. And then there are a
number of special matters inviting, if not de
manding, special congressional action, such as
the Mexican situation and the general indus
trial complexities of today.
AND the peace treaty. And the national con
ventions are only about six months away. And
it isn't going to be all donkey or all elephant.
Oh, it's going to be a merry, and a busy,
and an interesting AND .a vital little session
up there under the big white dome. Let's go,
gentlemen, and let's go hard. '
* * * *
President Wilson's message was read to
Congress on Tuesday. It ignored, save by In
ference, the question of the treaty of peace
which the Senate was unable definitely to dis
pose of in its extra session, and procee<fed to a
heart-to-heart discussion of the pressing domes
tic problems of the day. In connection with a
number of his recommendations the President
took occasion to remind the national legislators
that he was merely repeating his urgent re
quests for action of many months ago. The
facial expressions with which the republican
Congress, upon which none of the innuendo of
bis words was lost, received this mild verbal
chastisement were an amusing study.
The President advocated a budget system
for national appropriations and expressed the
belief that the budget, prepared by the execu
tive, should be submitted to a single committee
in each house. He would combine this budget
scheme with a system of auditing the expendi
ture of national fundB, with a view to assuring
economy and efficiency. In otl^pr words, he
wants to see the wasteful habfts of government
finance in the United States discarded in favor
of approved modern business methods.
He bespoke the simplification of taxation,
with the possible reduction of the income and
profits taxes, on the ground that a fellow gets
discouraged in peace time if he knows that
energy and enterprise and thrift are rewarded
by an increasingly heavy bill from the
government. The discouragement of errterpris
ing fellows produces industrial stagnation,
which would be Industrial suicide for' the United
States in this era of its new position as the
greatest creditor nation in the world.
The question of controlling prices in the
public Interest was gone into at some length,
and a general system of effective arbitration
to reduce industrial friction and general un
rest in the body politic advocated. Yet while
emphasizing the need for meeting the legitimate
aspirations of labor half way, the President, in
closing, sounded a solemn warning, to the ef
fect that there is but one way of<accompllshing
great reforms In American Institutions, that
way leading through the orderly processes of
representative government.

The failure of the President to address the
Congress definitely on the subject of the tabled
peace treaty, while a matter of surprise to
many, was generally anticipated in political cir
cles. The strategy upon which this studied
omission was based lies, briefly, in the follow
ing facts:
The public is clamoring for the remedying
of the domestic ills of the nation. The Presi
dent concentrated his message upon a rehearsal
of these ills, and, in urging that Congress take
certain steps to remedy them, politely reminded
all concerned that it is up to Congress. He did
so in the assurance that Congress will be un
able to dispose of the indicated problems with
out first placing the nation on a peace basis.
When the significance of the dilemma shall have
been borne home to Congress the President un
doubtedly proposes, in a new message, to call
the attention of all concerned to the economic
pains the country is suffering owing to the fail
ure of the gentlemen of the Senate to ratify the
peace treaty.
He will then invite them to make a prompt
peace as an essential to industrial and economic
health. And a prompt peace, as the Senate
well knows, means the tabled treaty, changed
in no material aspect.
* * * *
Senator Lodge, chairman of the foreign rela
tion committee, is preparing, on the other hand,
to report out a joint resolution from that body
declaring the war to be at an end. Now the
fact that a' joint resolution of a republican
senator does not require the signature of a
democratic executive would make this move
seem plausible enough from the viewpoint of the
treaty opponents, were it not for one thing.
And that one thins is that constitutionally it
can't be done, i In other words, Congress could
declare what it might desire, but the declara
tion would not be legally true. Definite peace
can only be obtained through a treaty. And
treaties must be negotiated by. the executive,
by and with the consent of the Senate.
All of which leaves the treaty question high
in the air, a situation which is unhealthy and
unsatisfactory from the viewpoint of the nation
at large. In this connection Frank' L. Polk,
head of the United States delegation to the
peace conference, has felt it necessary to in
form the chief of the German representatives
that delay in definite action upon the treaty by
the United States should not be interpreted by
Germany as in her favor.

Venustiano persists in monkeying with the
buzz-saw. Venustiano, which is the given name
of the more commonly known Carranza, seemed
during the early part of the week determined
to bring about American Intervention in Mexico.
If the bewhiskered old gentleman had anything
of a reputation for disinterested patriotism his
motives might have been worthy enough at that.
But he hasn't. So, with the theory that he had
reached the conclusion that Mexico needs the
type of government the United State's could
furnish it out of the question, his policy re
mains inexplicable.
Inexplicable or not, it put him in agua calida.
as they say below the Rio Grande. Secretary
Lansing's final peremptory demand for the re
lease of United States Consular Agent Jenkins
directly charged Mexico with bad faith and On
friendly behavior. The State Department, ap
parently absolutely sure of its position, talked
good ol' American turkey. -
Came swift subsequent moves by the Mexi
can and United States governments. The Mexi
can congress was reported to have turned over
the entire handling of the crisis to Caraanza.
Resolutions were Introduced on Capitol Hill pro
viding for the withdrawal by the United States
of its recognition of the Carranza government
and the severance of diplomatic relations with
Mexico. Senator Fall of New Mexico, In intro
ducing his resolution, asserted that the Jenkins
outrage is but one of a number bf sufficient
reasons for such action by the United States.
The senator charged the Mexican government
with being guilty of propaganda for the spread
of bolshevik doctrines in this country.
, Taking up this resolution, the Senate foreign
relations committee called upon Henry PI
Fletcher, United States ambassador to Mexico,
and Secretary of State Lansing for information
in r?gard to the crisis. From Secretary Lansing
it was learned that the State Department,has
been handling the Mexican crisis entirely ' on
its own." It was decided to defer further con
gressional action pending a reply for a request
for an audience with the President by a sub
committee composed of Senators Hitchcock, ad
ministration leader, and Fall, implacable politi
cal enemy of the President. The outward pur
pose of the audience was announced as to en
able Senator Fall to lay before the executive
certain extremely confidential "affairs of gov
ernment," and to obtain for the Senate an ex
pression of the President's views in the crisis.
And then, on Friday afternoon, while the
largely advertised conference was taking place,
came word that Jenkins had been released. Of
course, there remains an aftermath in the Fall
propaganda charges. But for the time being it
would seem that Venustiano, contemplating the
buzz-saw and judging wisely, had once again
decided to be discreet?just in time.

Events in the coal strike situation have
moved forward with steady tread to whatever
the climax may be in the struggle between a
fraction of a class and the people as a wholp.
On Monday restrictions more drastic than the
war-time fuel regulations were issued by the
new fuel administration. Non-essential indus
tries, it was announced, are to have their supply
rigidly cut off and the consumption of essential
industries is to be closely watched for wastage.
The public was called upon to exercise patience
and tolerance.
Governors of many of the soft-coal-produc
ing states continued their efforts toward ob
taining production of coal, while urging upon
the government the perfection of a complete
fuel administration, with an administrator for
each state.. Equitable distribution of coal under
uniform regulations to all states was requested.
Attorney General Palmer, estimating that
the miners' demands would mean excessive
prices in all commodities to the public for
three years, urged the public to hold out.
No considerable break in the union's ranks
was effected during the week, and reports were
circulated that benefits were being paid in some
districts despite the Indianapolis injuncton, and
that funda from secret sources were being used
to tide over the miners in their fight.
The truth in these allegations was substan
tiated on Thursday, when eighty-four interna
tional and district officers of the United Mine
Workers of America were summoned to court
in Indianapolis to answer charges of criminal
contempt, it being alleged that they have con
spired to keep the strike in force, thus viola tlrg
the terms of the Injunction.
Labor, looking upon these proceedings as a
war of extermination upon the rights it ha*
come to regard as lncontestible, is reported to
be determined to fight the issue to a finish.
What the result will be with the United States
government, backed by more than 100,000,000
loyal citizens, equally determined to put an end
to those features of a system which enable a
selfish minority to wring its ambitions from
the public at the point of a pistol, cannot be a
matter of doubt. It may take time. It may
mean more than inconvenience and monetary
loss, but in the end, as long as America shall
stand, the will of the people, as expressed
through their government, will be supreme:
Labor, unless it chooses to be outlawed by
every true patriot, must see this fact and
capitulate before it be too late.
* * * *
Appropriations of practically $5,000,000,000
are estimated as essential for conducting the
peace-time activities of the government during
the fiscal year of 1921. This is more tftan five
times the sum required for peace-time govern
mental expenses in the year immediately pre
ceding the world war. A vigorous attack has
been made on the estimates by Senator Warren
of Wyoming, chairman of the appropriation
committee of the upper house. The attack will
be applauded heartily by the public if it pro
duces anything in the way of saving witfiout
sacrificing essentials. This business of paying
a 400 per cent increase for a government that
doesn't seem able to do anything more for us
than the old ones did does seem a bit excessive,
even in these days of high living expenses.
ENFORCEMENT OF NATIONAL PROHIBITION
A GIGANTIC TASK FOR THE GOVERNMENT;
ALL GOOD CITIZENS ARE ASKED TO ASSIST
' > w ? ' ????????????? ?
BY LEONARD OKHEKOD.
THERE is in Washington a
man charged with one of
the.most stupendous tasks
that have confronted a gov
ernment official since the days of
the Continental. Congress ? the
task of enforcing a law the like
of which was never before written
into the statutes of a nation.
During the year 1917, which pre
ceded the advent of nation-wide
prohibition, there was poured
down the American throat some
1,884,000,000 gallons of malted
liquors, 161,000,000 gallons of na
tive spirituous liquors, 37,640,000 gal
lons of domestic wines and 24,000,000
gallons of domestic brandy, not to
tnention some 8,000,000 gallons of
imported spirits and wines.
And it is the job of Daniel C.
Roper, commissioner of internal
revenue, to make "bone dry" an
area of 3,755,000 square miles,
whose hundred-odd million in
habitants but recently required
more than 2,000,000,000 gallons of
intoxicating beverages to assuage
their thirst for a twelvemonth.
* * * *
To the question: "How under the
sun are you going to do it?" Com
missioner Ropfer makes answer:
"I have an abiding faith in the
American people."
This is not the statement of a
visionary, for the man who Is
charged with collecting some $6,
000.000,000 in income taxes, excess
profits taxes and other Items of
revenue for 1919 can cherish no
illusions about the temper or char
acter of the people. Rather It is
his past efperience as collector of
internal revenue under the most
drastic tax law the country ever
saw that makes that official confi
dent of his power to enforce pro
hibition. Briefly he has summed
the situation up as follows:
"Prohibition in no longer an (?
sue;, it is only a question of law
enforcement.
"Every citizen must take his
place in one of two groups; either
with the good citizens, who believe
the law and the Constitution
should be enforced, or with the
bad citizens, who seek to violate
or evade the law, and the latter
group is entitled to no standing.
"There might be another tem
porary classification <of the poten
tially gopd citizen; the man or
woman who when shown the
morality and justice of keeping
a law will keep it even though
they may find the law objection
able."
* ? * *
To put this principle In operation
It Is proposed to appoint a federal
prohibition director for every
state in the Union. His first duty
will be to co-operate with the state
officials and with the county and
municipal officials in the state In
enforcing the law. State officers
and lesser officials who may be in
clined to wink at voiiatlons of the
prohibition laws wiH find their
evasion exposed, even where their
action does not make them liable in
the courts.
The state director will deal ex
clusively with the good citizen and
the potentially good citjwn. He
will organize publld opinion
through the medium 6f civic, re
ligious, fraternal and commercial
organizations. He will be an
apostle not so much of prohibition
as of lafr enforcement. To him will
fall the task of administering the
permissive features of the law.
such as the manufacture and sale
of near-beer, the use of non-bev
erage alcohol, use of liquors for
sacramental and medicinal pur
poses, and the assessment of taxes,
etc. Each director will have a
corps of assistants to be known
federal prohibition inspectors,
i \
v srv
who will determine for the direc
tor the conditions existing in every
part of the state.
In short It is assumed by Com
missioner Roper that the great'ma
jority of state, county and mu
nicipal officials, as well as the pub
lic, believe the law of the land
should be enforced, and the state
director is to develop that idea and
assist in its execution in the
frankest possible mannc
* * * *
What, then, for the bad citizen;
the man who looks upon the law,
and, finding it not to his liking, de
cides to disregard it, and who for
one reason or another cannot be
reached by local authorities?
The country is to be divided into
nine districts, each under the ju
risdiction of a supervising federal
prohibition agent, who probably
will come to be known by the
shorter title of "raiding agent." To
him and his subordinates will be
assigned the task of making ar
rests and bringing offenders before
the bar of the federal courts. To
say the raiding agent represents
the "strong arm of the law" will
be no mere figure of speech. This
federal police force will be akin
to the secret service, in that it will
operate without regard to state or
nunlclpal boundaries, and may be
counted upon to descend upon the
law breaker "at a time when he
knoweth not."
T- * * * *
Mr. Iloper and his associates
know from experience where to
look out for moonshining, bootleg
ging, the abuse of non-beverage
alcohol and the smuggling from
wet countries. The character of
the population of every section of
the country, the attitude of its
courts and the public and its geo
graphical location will be taken
Into account.
Information gathered by the
state directors will be available for
the raiding: agents, but they will
have little else in common. None of
the agents of the state directors will
make arrests, and the men who
make the raids will be compara
tively unknown in the places in
which they operate. All this is cal
culated to impress on Mr. Ameri
can Citizen that he muqt either co
operate with the state director in
observing the eighteenth amend
ment to the Constitution, or he
must live in fear of feeling the
hand of the raiding agent on his
shoulder.
* * * *
Every man and woman who en
ters the service of the bureau in
this work must Be strongly in fa
vor of the enforcement of the pro
hibition and other laws, and must
have had no recent connection with
the liquor trade.
Congress a long time ago passed
a law which provided that who
ever informed the government of
certain classes of tax evasions
should be entitled to a share of the
money recovered. This syatem,
which Mr. Roper characterizes as
savoring of a "spy system." was at
one time much in favor, and there
is one instance of an informant re
ceiving $50,000 for doing what any
good citizen should have done for
nothing, when he knew the law
wat being evaded.
Mr. Roper therefore takes much
pride in the following paragraph
which appears in his annual report
to the Secretary of the Treasury,
made public last Friday:
"Recommendations to the Secre
tary of the Treasury were prepared
in the cases of eleven claims for
reward during the year. The
amount paid out on this account
during the year was $5,361.12. The
small amount of this item is indi
cative of the general policy pur
aued by the bureau with respect to

Secretary Olass of the Treasury, In his
annual report, made public last week,
calls attention to the fact that the
rresent revenue law, with its very high
income and excess profits taxes, of
necessity has been responsible for
much of the increased cost of lining.
And the public is beginning to msk
itself more and more: What is the
reason for these high federal taxes?
The war is over and peace is here?
even though the peace treaty hasn't yet
been ratified. It is estimated that dur
ing the fiscal year ending June 30. 1921,
$4,515,000,000 will be collected In cus
toms, Income and profits taxes and mis
cellaneous internal revenue taxes.
Estimates of Receipts.
Further, it is estimated that the total
receipts of the federal government dur
ing the fiscal year 1921, including re
ceipts from the sale of public lands,
Panama canal tolls, the public debt and
other miscellaneous sources, and the
taxes already mentioned, will reach a
grand total of $5,620,000,000. Quite a
sizable sum.
There are only two reasons for gath
ering this huge sum. First, to meet
the expenses of the government, and,
second, to pay the war debt, or rather
to pay the Interest on the debt and make
a beginning at retiring that debt.
With these reasons eliminated there
would be no reason whatever for col
lecting federal taxes from the people.
Now, the war debt must eventually
be paid, and the government must
continue to operate and pay its ex
penses. The only hope for the people,
when it comes to the question of re
ducing taxation, is to cut down the
expenses of running the government.
Secretary Glass had this in mind, un
doubtedly, when he recommended
that Congress make no appropriations
for expenditures in, new fields in the
appropriation bills for the fiscal year
1921, which are now to be enacted into
law.
Estimates Are Enoraou.
But in spite of this wise admonition
of the Secretary of the Treasury, a book
of estimates compiled by the executive
departments?the only national budget
which the government now ha??waa
transmitted to Congress last Monday
ky Mr. Glass which Is positively stag
gering. To many persons, especially
those who are having a hard time pay
ing war taxes in peace times, these es
timates appear scandalous. It seems
that every executive department of the
government and every bureau, ignoring
the necessity for economy in govern
ment expenditures, is demanding hun
dreds of thousands and millions of dol
lars more even than was appropriated
for the present fiscal year, which has
been, next to the actual war years, the
year of greatest expenditures on the
part of the government.
Glance at this budget?thrown to
gether without any attempt at co-ordi
nation and correlation. It calls for a
total expenditure of 14.473.696,358?al
most five billions of dollars. The ap
propriations for the present fiscal year
were $5,629,486,359, and during this year
the government still had many war ex
penditures to meet, including those for
the Army and Navy and the railroads
under government ownership. This sum
also included $1,000,000,000 appropriated
as the wheat guarantee fund. And when
this wheat fund is subtracted from the
appropriations for the present fiscal
year, these appropriations exceed those
now proposed for the fiscal year 1921 by
only $156,790,000.
Ar?umeat (or a Budget.
If ever there was an argument ready
to the hand In favor of the adoption
of a rational, national budget sys
tem. scientifically planned, with the
responsibility placed squarely upon
an executive head, this book of esti
mates just submitted is it. The House
has already passed the Good budget
bill, and the Senate budget commit
tee is beginning hearings upon the
Good bill and another introduced by
Senator McCormick of Illinois, who is
[ chairman of the budget committee. In
the book of estimates it seems that
the head of every department and
bureau has attempted to get all of
the government money?which is the
taxpayer s money in the end?that he
can get, without any regard to the
general needs of the government or
the necessity for strict economy at
this juncture.
Another thing about the book of
estimates?no recommendations are
made for increases in pay of the gov
ernment employes.* Congress is left
to figure out such Increases as it may
desire to make after the reclassification
commission now at work has made its
report. If the recommendations of the
commission are followed out, it may
reasonably be expected that millions of
dollars more, perhaps hundreds of mil
lions, will be added to the appropriations
asked. But almost every department
wants employes, and It wants funds for
new work, new investigations. Ail of
these new projects may be laudable.
But there is no more reason why the
federal government, when the Treasury
is "strapped." should undertake these
very beneficial things than there is for
a private individual to undertake to
build an addition to his home when he
hasn't the money to pay his grocery
bills.
?
Borden to Average Family.
Averages are not always trust
worthy In arriving at conclusions, but
sometimes they ofTer the only way
getting an approximate answer
to particular questions. For instance,
how do the federal taxes affect the
ordinary, average American family?
On the basis of 106,871,000 peo
ple In continental United 8tates. the
estimate of population made by the
census bureau July l. 1919, and af
45 persons to a family, there would
be about 23.700.000 families. The
taxes estimated to be raised through
the customs and internal revenue in
the flscal year 1921 are $4,515,000,000.
The American people, one way or an
other, are (join* to pay these taxes.
There is no escape. They must pav
I them either directly or Indirectly. The
tax per family will run about $190.
The average Income of the American
J family, as nearly as It can be esti
j mated from data at hand, is about
*1.200. Take $190 from this income and
I you have $1,010 left. You have lopped
off 15.8 per cent of the income. It may
be said that the federal taxes do not
fall regularly upon all families and
that, therefore. It is not fair to make
such a subtraction However, the cost
to the people comes not only in
rect taxes, but In the higher cost of
food, clothing, rents, etc.. and every
family has to eat. wear clothes and
have a shelter. So these taxes are
much more equally distributed than
might be thought at first glance. It is
an old saying that "the poor pay most
of the taxes, anyway." Certainly they
feel the burden far more than the
rich.
Part of this $190 will be taken in,
incopie taxes, part in the internal
revenue direct taxes *' upon various
kinds of commodities and part will
be taken indirectly through taxes
upon corporations and Individuals
producing articles which the people
purchase and consume, and still an
other part -will be taken in the cus
toms on imported, articles. The in
direct taxes are practically always
passed along to the consumer.
Big Part of H. C. I..
And. so it may be judged, the fed
eral taxes play a most important part
In the present high cost of living,
and a reduction in these taxes will
be a great boon to the American peo
ple. And the only way to make a
reduction possible is to pare the
expenditures of the federal govern
ment to the bone.
The etimated cost on the public
I debt to be paid In the flscal year 1921
is $1,017,500,000. The estimate also
includes $287,500,000 to become part
of a sinking fund for the retirement
of the public debt, which on October
SI, 1919. amounted to $26,210,530,000.
the vast amount of which was in
curred during the war. Subtract the
interest on the de?t and the sink
ing fund from the estimates and the
result will be what the government
proposes to expend in its vanous op
erations during the flscal year 1921.
approximately f3,168,500.000. This "is
some $2,000,000,000 more than the gov
ernment was expending annually be
fore the United States Entered the
war. t
The suggestion has been made in
some quarters, by the New York
Chamber of Commerce notably, that
the government should undertake to
fund the debts of the allies to the
United States. The foreign loans on
Ocober SI, 1919, amounted to $9,406 -
371,888.55. It is urged that if these
loans oould be used to pay the in
terest, or a large part of it, on our
public debt, and also to establish a
sinking fund for the retirement of
the principal of the public debt, then
it would be possible to reduce still
further tlie taxes under which the peo
ple of the country are struggling.
Little Grumbliag During War.
The voters, who are the taxpayers,
paid their taxes with little or no
grumbling during the war. They knew
that the money was needed for the
men in Prance on the fighting line
to win the war. But with peace at
hand they are demanding that Con
gress and the executive give them
some relief, and they intend to have
this relief if they can get it. In the
last revenue bill, which became a law
last spring, the democratic Congress
then In power not only fixed the taxes
to be charged on incomes received in
the calendar year 1918, but also on
those received in the year 1919, which
are to be collected in 1920. The ques
tion has been raised as to whether it
would not be possible to reduce the
taxes to be collected on the incomes
deceived this year, which are payable
in .1920, but it is said that in view
of the big appropriations already
made for the flscal year ending June
30. 1920. and the obligations of the
government, it would not be wise to
undertake such a reduction.
However, the republican Congress
is beginning to look into this matter
of tax reduction, and the ways and
means committee of the House and
the finance committee of the Senate,
it is said, will be getting to work on
this problem before long.
Minority Leadership
in Senate Discussed;
Two May Be in Race
Between now and adjournment for the
holiday recess it is expected that the
democrats of the Senate will settle the
contest over the democratic floor lead
ership. made vacant by the death of
Senator Martin of Virginia. While no
formal announcement has been made,
senators understand that Senator Un
derwood is a receptive candidate for the
leadership.
Senator Hitchcock, ranking minority
member of the committee on foreign
relations and still in charge of the ad
ministration fight for the league of na
tions, is a candidate.
The contest thus far has been a
friendly rivalry, and no bitterness is ex
pected to be engendered. The sentiment
of senators toward proposed reserva
tions to the covenant of the league of
nations is said to have a bearing upon
the situation.
