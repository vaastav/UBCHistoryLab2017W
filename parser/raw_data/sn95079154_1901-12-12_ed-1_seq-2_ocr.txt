THURSDAY. DECEMBER 12, 1901.
THE PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE.
President Rooeevelt's ttrst message to
the Congress is a very lengthy but a ven?
able paper. While there has been a disposi
tion on the part of some of the D?mocrat?
ie prees to make ail verse criticisms on the
message, upon the whole it has been well
received by the President's political ml
versarte*. It ie ho non-partisan i.n.l 6o
American in tone that it necessarily evoke?
admiration where it doce not even win
assent to his views on the many impor?
tant questions discussed.
Tue opening paragraphs contain a feel?
ing and graphie account of the Hssassinn
tion of President McKinley. The life of the
martyr President is reviewed, his intimate
touch with the masses of the people dem?
onstrated and the example of has life held
up as a model for the citizens of the Na
tion. Speaking of the us-assin the Pi esident
says: "That there might be nothing lack?
ing to complete the Judas-like infamy of
his act he took advantage of an occasion
when the President was meeting the peo?
ple generally; and advancing as if to take
the band outstretched to him in kindly
and brotherly fellowship, he turned the
noble and generous confidence of the vic?
tim into an opportunity to strike the latal
blow. There is no baser deed in all the
annals of crime."
The President then proceeds to show
that no matter calls more urgently for
?Congressional action than the passage of
laws for the punishment of the assassina?
tion or attempted assassination of a Presi?
dent or any of those who are in line of
succession to the Presidency; and for the
suppression of anarchy. He say m : "Anar?
chy is a crime against the whole human
race, and all mankind should band against
the anarchist."
He tuen proceeds to discuss the growth
of trusts and the creation of corporate
firtunes. This is done in an admirable
and forcible way. The over capitalization
evil is referred to, and it is recommended
that (his danger should be removed by
Government regulation, if Congress has
not the authority to remove the evil it
should be done by constitutional enact
men*. We have seen no eliscnssion of the
trust question that is as clear, conclusive
and at the same time as conservative as
that of President Roosevelt.
The President recommends the creation
of another Cabinet officer to be known as
the "Secretary ol Commerce and Indus?
try," and he would have that officer deal
with commerce "in its broadest sense."
He urges the re enactment of the Chin?
ese labor exclusion act and insists that
more car*fui attention should he given to
the ??'elusion of unelesirabie immigrants
who may come to this e-ountry from Eu?
rope. The Pr?vient congratulates the
country that wa.'es are now higher in this
Country than they have ever been before
and that they are much higher than they
a-e in any country. He recommends that
C engre?a shall make strong efforts to assist
the various States of the Union in their
endeavor to get rkl of the competition of
ooovict labor ?rttfa tlie honest labor of the
country.
The President asserts that, "There is a
general acquiescence in our present tariff
system as a national policy;" and he is
decided in his opposition to any changes
in the tariff laws at the present, except
that he favors "reciprocity," which he
pronounces "the handmaiden of protec?
tion."
The American merchant marine the
President says, "should be restored to the
ocean." The condition of this important
interest "is such as to call for immediate
remedial action by the Congress." He
favors the establishment of shipping lines
to the principal countries with which we
have dealings, and declares "that this,
would be of political as well as commer
c'al benelit."
In his treatment of the question of cur?
rency and banks he says: "The Act of
March 14, 1900, intended unequivocally
to establish gold as the standard money
and to maintain at a parity therewith all
forms of money medium now in use with
an, has been shown to be timely and judi?
cir its." Then he declares:
"In many respects the National Bank?
ing Law furnishes sufficient liberty for the
proper exercise of banking function; but
there seems to be need of better safeguards
against the deranging influence of com?
mercial crises and financial panics.
Moreover, the currency of the country
?bould be made responsive to the de?
mands of our domestic trade and com?
merce."
While acknowledging that the revenues
now being collected by internal taxation
exceed the ordinary expenditures of the
Government, be urges "that great care
should oe taken not to reduce the reve?
nues so that there will be any possibility
of a deficit."
The protection of Forests and Irrigation
of Arid Lend* are discussed at considera- J
ble length and are made important feat?
ures of the mfsBHge.
Hawaii, Porto Rico and Cuba, as to
their condition, are briefly discussed, but
very pointedly, while the future of the
Philippines is treated in a nmnner which
shows that the President has given the
subject careful consideration. In speaking
of the task our country has been called
upon to perform in that country, he Fays:
' It i- no light task for a nation to achieve
the temperamental qualities without which
the institutions of free government are
bul a mockery." He considers that it
would be a crime against humanity for us
to now leave the Filipino? to govern them?
selves: and seems to think that if error
ban leen committed in our management
of the ?sIuihIh it has leen occasioned by
our anxiety to loo rapidly give them local
self-government.
In speaking of the proposed Isthmian
Canal he says: "No single great mateiial
work which remains to t?e undertaken un
this continent is of such consequence to
the Auitiicaii people ah the huil.iing of a
canal acroes the Isthmus cjtineciiiig North
ami South America. He then announces
his pleasure at being able to Inform Con
gi ,*s that the Clayton-Bulwcr Treaty has
been abivgaleti ami n new treaty ims been
???.ned between the United States and
Gieat Britain, "which guarantees to this
nation every right that it has ever ?t-ked
in connection with the canal." lie favors
the construction of the canal with all pos
bible speed.
Our navy he urges should be strength
tned by by additions to our battleships
ami enlargement of trained crews. He
sa*.?-: "Good ships and g?>od guns aie
simply good weapons and the best weap?
ons are useless save in hands of men who
know how to light with them.'' He ad?
vocates encjiiragemeiit to the naval mili?
tia and urges that a national naval renerve
shall ut once he proviiled for.
The army be ?ays is now large enough
for present emerg ncies, "but U is neces
sary to keep it at the highest point of effi?
ciency "
Ha strongly advocates the meiit
system. He says: "It is important to
have this system obtain at home, but it
is even more important to have it applied
rigi lly in our insular possessions. Not an
otli.-e should be tilled in the Philippines or
Porto Kico with anv regard to the man's
partisan affiliations or services, with any
regard to the political, social or personal
influence whi?i he may have at his com?
mand."
Our consular service lie says, "is inade?
quate as at present constituted.''
The Charleston and si. Louis Exposi?
tions are spoken of approvingly; and he
tells of the Chinese settlement and the
terms upon which the troubles were ter?
minated.
The growth of oar postal system is set
foil h and recommendations made concern
i ing free rural ?lelivery.
As we have said, ihe message i*< a very
able one ami is well worthy the perusal of
every citizen of our country.
There have been two bills alrea?ly in?
troduced in Congress looking to a ieduc
tion of representation from those Southern
States where the negroes have been dis?
franchised. We predicted that euch meas?
ure would be introduced, ami we will not
he sut prised to see them adopted.
The Constitutional Convention is still
making slow progress with its work. Evi
deiitily it does not understand what it
ought to do, or begins to realize that it
cannot do what it wants to do.
Usefulness of the Bat.
Savannah News.
The cruel practice of capturing a num?
ber of bats and crucifying them on the
doors, of barns, stables, or even of houses,
has been somewhat abandoned, even in
the country. But due credit is not given
to the great services which these ug!y
creatures render. It can lie said that,
after the birds, it is the most useful aid of
the agriculturist. It makes a war of ex?
termination on the innumerable insects
and caterpillars which devastate the crops.
It devours Hies by millions and millions.
Some figures based on the authority of
learned naturalists are remarkable. For
one of his repasts a bat does not eat less
than thirteen caterpillars, and in twenty
four hours the smallest specimen will eas?
ily eat eighty flies or more. Besides, this
ugly thing is extremely clean; as much so
as the most retintd cat.

"Punishing the Setith."
l'liiliidili liiie Free?.
The on? and only plea made against the
bills introduced into Congress to compel
the Southern States to obey the Federal
Constitution in establishing suffrage regu?
lations is that these bills are intended "to
punish the South." This plea is not en?
tered by the Democratic or genuinely in?
dependent newspapers. The former have
long si uce cease. I to defend the methoels
by which the Southern States have dis
franchiseel the colored voters, and the
independent newspapers like the Brook?
lyn Eagle, the Boston Herald, ?the Provi?
dence Journal, the Springfield Republi?
can, the New York Sun, the New York
Times, the Chicago Record-Herald and
the Cliicago Chronicle, have frankly told
the South that it is perpetrating an injus?
tice on the North and that this injustice
will have to be atoned for.
It may be well to quote the language of
a caneliei Southern newspaper on this que?
tion for the benefit of those who are chat?
tering about punishing the South by re?
quiring it to obey the Constitution. There
is no abler newspaper in the South than
the Richmond Tunes. It is straight Dem?
ocratic, but in commenting on the recent
utterances of Representative Moody, who
introduced the suffrage investigation bill
in Congress Monday, the Times says:
'Sooner or later the Republicans of the
North are going to have a reckoning with
the p?*ople of the South 00 thisquestion of
suffrage. The various devices that have
been adopted by this Slate and that to
evade the Fifteenth Amendment are going
to he brought under the review of the
United States Supreme Court, and we do
not believe that any one of them will stand
the test. If this be not done then certain?
ly an effort will be made to deprive those
States of representation in Congress in
proportion to the number of negro voters
disfranchised by reason of their race,
color or previous condition of servitude."
The statement that some Northern
States are violating the Constitution by
prescribing suffrage requirements that
transgress the United States Constitution
is no argument at all. It is simply say?
ing: "You're another." If Massachu?
setts aaid ?Connecticut or any other North?
ern State have placed any restrictions on
the exercise of the suffrage which violate
the tenus of the Fourteenth and Fifteenth
Amendments they must pay the penalty
for that violation. And it i? pertinent to
note that Representative Moo?ly, who has
made the first and most energetic move
against disfianchisement, is from Massa?
chusetts, one of the accused States. Of
Mi. Moody and his bill the Boston Tran?
script sa\ s- Mr. Moody is one of the most
prominent as well as one' of tin; ablest of
the House Republicans. He is quite as
canable of forcing the contideration eef this
issue a* of falling into line on a pre?ar
rauged plan.
There is no purpose of "punishing the
South" in this effort to rwtlfj the wrong
elone by disfranchisi'meni m the Southern
States. It is a ?toss outran* which has
been endured too long and which should
be ended as soon as possible. Mr. Moody
put it in the right light when he said: "I
do not know why forty white men in Mis?
sissippi, even if they all vote, should have
the same voting power as one hundred
men in Massachusetts." Public opinion
demands that this wrong shall be rectified,
anil it will not be turned from its purpose
by childish talk about "punishing the
South."

"Something New Under The Sun."
All doctors have tried to cure CATARRH
by the use of powders, acid -gases, inhalers
and drugs in paste form. Their powders
dry up the mucuous membranes causing

tirely eaten away ttie same membranes

the disease. An old and experienced

AN INTERESTING SPOT
Point Where Colorado, Utah, New Mexico
and Arizona Meet.
St holl?n Republic.
11 may seem a broad statement to one
who hears it for the first time that the
only pluce where four States, Territories
or provinces join is that point where Colo?
rado, Utah, New Mexico and Arizona
meet. Not only is this the only "four
corners" in the United States but it is the
only "comer" of its kind in the world.
Although the locality is unique in this
respect, it is one not often visited, as it is
not easy of access. Few tourists care to
endure the hardships of a pilgrimage to
see the monument which marks the spot.
The stone was erected by the United
States Government surveyors and is sinii
ilar to those used to mark their boundary
lines. On the simple shaft in the center
of the rocks is inscribed the names of the
States and Territories which touch the
spot.
The monument ?p reached by a trail
which leads from the road between Nav
ajo Springs and Aneth, Utah. The trail
leaves the road near Scott's trading post,
close to the Utah line, and croHses the San
Juan River. Then its course is along a
spur of the Corriza Mountains until it
comes to the top of the spur, where the
shaft is situated. It is in the midst of a
country once densely populated by the
cliff d?sellers. The ruins of their homes
are all about this section. The point is
nearly one hundred miles from Mancos,
Col., the nearest railroad town. Were it
not for the rocks -i wagon could be placed
eo that the four wheels would be in as
many different States.
The monument was destroyed a few
years ago by the Navajos, but was rebuilt
last summer.

The Pay of Federal Judges.
I'hiladclpnia Pre.??.
Attorney General Knox, in his annual
report, recommends an increase in the
salaries of the Federal judges. It is a
subject that ought to have favorable con?
sideration at an e rly day.
The judges of the Supreme Court of the
United States receive $10,000 a year, with
the exception of the chief justice, who has
an additional $500. The salary of circuit
judges is $11,000 and that of district judges
.$5,000. This is small pay for the ability
and character required of these places and
for the labor that must be done. It must
also be taken into account that many of
these judge? are required to go about a
good deal and hold court in different
places.
There is probably no man tit to sit on
the Federal bench who coulil not easilv
earn much more than the judicial salary in
the practice of his profession, though the
honor of the position is the temptation to
make the sacrifice. Apart from the only
favorable thing is the fact that it is a life
place, the incumbent being properly free
from any concern about election or re elec?
tion. It has been a fortunate thing for
the country ever since the organization of
the Government that few uintakea have
bee made in the selection of men for the
bench. lawyers of the best character
and distinguishe?! ability have been will?
ing to serve, and they should be properly
paid.
Many of the States reward their judges
far better than the general Government.
This is particularly true of New York.
One-third of the Common Pleas and
Orphans' Court judges in Pennsylvania
receive higher salaries than the United
Slates district judges, while the pay of the
judges of the Supreme and Superior courts
of the State is larger than that of the Fed?
eral circuit judges, and no discriminating
citizen will pretend that any Pennsylva?
nia judge who is fit for his place is paid
too much,
There should be no niggardliness on the
part of the Government in such a matter
as this. It justly exacts the most scrupu?
lous service and it should be just in re?
warding it. The Attorney General has
made a very reasonable and proper sug?
gestion.

NEED OF WATER DRINKING.
How to Obtalra the* neat Resulta from
a, Conataat l'?e* of Nature's
Fluid.
A well-known nerve specialist ha*
said that "all neurasthenics (that is,
people with unhealthy nerve?) have
detieoated nerve* and suffer from an
insufficiency of fluid in the tissues of
the body." It is probable that we all,
in more or lesa degree, even when not
conscious of any definite symptoms,
are suffering in some part of our sys?
tem for tie lack of enough fluid, and
especially enough pure, cool water,
say.-. Youth's Companion.
We know that so nicely is the hu
mon body adjusted and adapted to its
uses that one part cannot ?uffer with?
out all suffering. If the nerves are
desiccated, or dried through lack of
fluid, then it is certain that other tis?
sues are also e^uffering from the same
lack, and that the wheels of the won?
derful machinery are being clogged by
reason of waste matter which is not
washed away.
We see by this that water does for us
a three-fold service. It feeds, it washes,
and it carries away the cinders of the
body furnace; and through the want
of it we are exposed to many and great
dangers'. The tissues become too dry,
the blood is thick and its flow sluggish,
and the retained waste of the body
?et* up a condition which the doctor?
call "autointoxication," or ?elf-poison?
ing. This condition may give rise to
almost any known symptoms, from a
pimple to heart failure, and is really
responsible for most of the semi-in?
valids with whom the world is largely
peopled.
To obtain the best results from wa
tf r-drinkingcertain rulesshould be ob?
served. People do not ell need the same
amount, and it may take a little ex?
perimenting to find out just how much
should be taken in individual oas??s. It
has been stated by some physicians
that five or six pints should be taken
during the 24 hours. Of this only a
moderate quantity should be taken
with the meals. It is a mistake to
take no water with a meal but it is
perhaps a greater mistake to wash
food down with water, especially with
ice-water.
The bes-t time for water-drinking is
at night and early in the morning. It
is well to form the habit of slowly sip
pin?,', during the bath and while dress?
ing, two or three glasses of cool?not
ice-cold?water. Two or three more
may be sipped at bedtime, and again
two or three glasses an hour or two
before luncheon and before dinner.
In a very ah*rt time the value of this
habit will beaxmie apparent in the re?
sultant general improvement in diges?
tion, temper and appearance.
AN INFANT'S WILL.
A Btmbr Prince**? Give? Her First
Answer to m Formal
Petition.
The little Princess Yolanda of Italy
has just granted her first favor and af?
firmed her power of doing good as a
royal princess, ?ays a London ex?
change.
An old Lady, widow of an officer, who
has for year? bothered chamberlain?*,
ministers, deputies and even King
Humbert himself to obtain more
money for her late hus-band'? services,
?vas struck recently with a capital
idea.
She wrote a petition which she di?
rected to "Her Royal Highness, the
Princess Yolanda, Quirlnal."
The document fell, of course, into the
hands' of the king, who read it, and,
with imperturbable seriousness, said
to hie chamberlain: "Take thig to the
princess, please, and make her ac?
quainted with the contents."
The marquis, on arriving before the
cradle of the royal baby, bowed
deeply, and, to the surprise of the
nurses, gravely read aloud the peti?
tion to her. Then he retired to the
king.
"Well, what did the princess ?ay?"
asked Victor Emanuel. "Nothing at
all, your majesty." "All right. Silence
gives consent. See that the old lady
gets her wishe* attendedv to."

The regulations aa to the costumes

signs is not peculiar to the British
race or to our own. It is common to
all humanity. Napoleon displayed a
profound knowledge of mankind and
of Frenchmen when he restored the
costumes of the old regime as well
as the old titles of nobility.

A NEW WEDDING CUSTOM.
Ab Elaborate Attempt to Have Fua
with a Bridal Couple on
a Trata.
A passenger on a train out of New
York the other night observed the most
elaborate attempt to have fun with a
young married couple that he e*/ei
encountered, say? the New York Sin.
After the train left Trenton, a man
passed through the car and laid on
every seat a printed handbill. It an?
nounced that at Philadelphia, a young
married couple, then seated in the
drawing-room of a car of which the
name was given, -were to leave the
train.
They were described briefly, and no?
tice was given that they would be more
closely indicated when the train
stopped. The handbill closed with the
announcement that rice would be dis?
tributed among the passengers* and
they were requested to make the cus?
tomary use of it.
In accordance with the notice the dis?
tributor of the original announce?
ments appeared in a few minutes and
laid on the seat of every passenger a
paper bag- of rice. The train soon
reached Philadelphia and some of the
passengers went to the platform to
see what effect this elaborate attempt
to worry the young people would
bave.
Apparently it was a failure. Tbe
bridal couple alighted and a party of
five or s-ix friends pelted them with
rice. But the rest of the passengers
paid no attention to the matter.

Rev. Edward Everett Hale, of Boston
was asked by a newspaper to write an ar?
ticle on how he keeps at work despite of
his age. He wrote the article and said it
was because he had religious faith, and the
article was rejected. Tbk rejection was
the subject of his text last Sunday.
HICK A DOG
Kick a dog and he bites you.
He bites you and you kick him.
The more you kick the more
he bites and the more he bites
the more you kick. Each
makes the other worse.
A thin body makes thin
blood. Thin blood makes a
thin body. Each makes the
other worse. If there is going
to be a change the help must
come from outside.
Scott's Emulsion is the right
help. It breaks up such a
combination. First it sets the
stomach right. Then it en?
riches the blood. That
strengthens the body and it
begins to grow new flesh.
A strong body makes rich
blood and rich blood makes a
strong body. Each makes the
other better. This is the way
Scott's Emulsion puts the thin
body on its feet. Now it can
get along by itself. No need
of medicine.
This picture represents
the Trade Mark of Scott's
Emulsion and is on the
wrapper of every bottle.
