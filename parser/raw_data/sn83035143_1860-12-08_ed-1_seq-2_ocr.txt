Delays are Dangerous.
South Carol'ma sesmi bent oa pushing her
tchcme of accession to immediate execution,
and darrt Hot Wait for a Southern Conten
tion. She bcj a turbulent spirit of discon'
tent, that has chafed under bir Union barnest
lo loug that the is as native as colt, and
plunges frantiraiiy to break her traces, leap
the fences and compel the attention of the
uorld to her ridiculous cavorting. She is
afraid to await the action of the mora mod'
crate States, lest sensible counsels should
prevail, and the disunion wound be bandaged
up for the healing process. A year ago she
tent ter special ambassador, Mr. Uemminger,
to treat with Virginia upon the Jobs Brown
affair, hoping that the Old Dominion would
join her own treasonable schemes. Virginia
sent him home without the accomplishment of
his mission, and good naturedly grumbled at
his hotel bills.
South Carolina has not forgot this, and bow
replies to the proposition of Virginia to treat
with her, by saying that the sole idea of Vir
ginia is 'to hinder our policy by a Southern
Convention and to drag us along in subservi
ency to her views of her border interests." This
is it exactly: South Carolina has no thought of
a united Southern interest ; no thought save
her own fancied exaltation. Rather than be
lifted one foot from her depth of treason and
suicidal policy, she would drag all the
other Southern States after her, well satisfit d
if she only his the name of being the first (
thrown off Federal power.
The Democratic press, (and, we are sorry
to see, several Republican Journals,) have
excused the South in her recession course, t y
laying all blame and responsibility upon the
Personal Liberty Bills of the North. Calls,
loud and long, have been made upon the
Northern States to repeal these laws, and
thus restore harmony. We have denied the
presumption that such legislation, on the
part of any of the Northern States, was the
cause of the secession movement. Now see
what the Charleston Mercury, the special dis
union organ, says :
"So far as the Cotton (States are concaruel,
these laws, excepting in 11. e insult Oiey con
vey to the South, and thu faithlessness Miey
indicate in the North, art not of the uvit
consequence. Few or none of our slaves -ire
lost, by being carried away and protected
from recapt'ire in the Northern States. Nor
to the frontier States are lA-'y of much conse
quence. Their slaves are stolen and carried
off nor by the agency of these Personal
Liberty Laws but by the combination of
individuals in the Northern States."
This Bhows the Southern view of these
Bills, and renders still more evident than be
fore, the fact that the existence of these Laws
is seized upon merely as a pretext by dough
face Northerners.
Population of Cincinnati.
The Cincinnatians were dissatisfied with
Wtooim of the census a taken by the
Federal officers, and so appointed canvassers
to take another census. The Federal count
gave the city a trifle over 160,000 inhabi
tants; the new census makes the number
171,293. The Commercial says this differ
ence may be readily accounted for, when we
remember that the Federal census wa3 taken
at a season of the year when thousands are
absent, and when this, like every laige city,
is depleted more than at any other time.
Now, these hundreds have returned, and are
enumerated, axd the result is an increase of
a trifle over ten thousand souls.

Prospects for the Cabinet.
A New Vork correspondent of the Cincin
nati Commercial writes :
The Cabinet of the President consists of
even members. I presume two will be taken
from seven of the old thirteen States, North,
two from the West, and three from the slave
States. This would be a fair distribution,
and a very liberal number to the South, as
they are numerically entitled to only two.
I think there is a general leeling here in
favor of a place in the Cabinet to the gallant
and noble C. M. Clay, of Kentucky. He is
looked upon as the Secretary of War. A
large number of Republicans would be very
glad to see ilr. Edward Bate, of Missouri,
associated with Mr. Lincoln, in the conduct
of the new Administration, as he is entirely
with the Republicans in sentiment and poli
cy, and is a gentleman in whose ability and
firmness all should have confidence.
The Kansas Troubles.
The Chicago Tribune says it has been in
firmed on good authority that Capt. Mont
gomery has not been away from his farm,
except on peaceful errands, for a year, and
that all disturbances in Southern Kansas,
whatever they have amounted to, were com
mitted by Jennison and sixteen men associated
with him, and that their movements had been
confined to the summary arrest and execution
of three of the kidnappers and desperadoes.
The special Kansas correspobdence of the
N. T. Tribune confirms this view. The old
fogy Judge Williams fled precepitately, on the
first intimation of possible danger to his
judicial bones. See what a picture this cor
respondent draws of the official.
The Courts of this imbecile old fogy are a
mockery of justice. God pity the people
that he is sent to rule over. The lawyers
know his weak points and unmitigated
egotism, and stroke him on the back, and
flatter him, and the one that can do it the beet
gains his case, whether he has justice on his
side or not. Wyandot County used to be in
cluded in his district, but suffering nnder the
galling yoke of his imbecility, and the great
uncertainty of seeing justice administered
in bis Court, they petitioned and lobbied the
Legislature, and got translerred to Judge
Petiit's district a first-rate Judge, and I hope
Lincoln will keep him in as long as we are in
Territorial vassalage; also the name of Judge
Eimore; but this old fogy Williams is the
greatest nuisance in the Territory, except the
U. S. Pre-esnmption law, which is the greatest
of all nui:intei. Williams's Court puts me
In mind of the rich old farmer out West,
whose daughters all married drunken, worth

Counsel for the Crisis.
The Repu&UiiilljLictT has passed through
an excitinir political canvass, aud baa been
successful, Its flbfrinees for the Presidency
and Vice Presidency have been elected. It
has carried tbgiiiaiture of every tree State.
If it has not elected a majority of the House
of Representatives it is because there were
twenty-five jripRHjesS, elected by the slave
holders on account of their slaves.
The Repuni-aE,4ib-,red upon the canvass
with adeclara.t4nnof Jtrmciplea, one of which,
and the only one touching slavery, asserted
their determination W prevent the extension
of slavery ipMllife territories of the Un
ion. Because ibey bjv asserted this princi
ple and elected their candidates, a part of the
South threatens resistance to federal authori
ty and secessiiio froB te federal Union. Part
ly from these Vu'reats; and partly from the em
barrassed ajdaUppsX bankrupt condition of
Urge portions of tit fcouth, which have pre
vented the payment jt debts contracted for
northern proierty sola to tne Bourn, a panic
began, which jewspAj&ersaud politicians have
inflamed, in the hope of frightening the peo
ple into somiCAiceMion which their uneca
bairassed jqdgmwij would not have made.
flow, niKkittKie-' circumstances, should
the Republican Act? How ought men of
sense and Bpiritx. deport themselves?
There can be but one answer. They should
deport themselves precisely as if no panic
existed, and no threats had been made. Who
ever it turned-by--panic or threat to the
right hand or to the left is a coward.
"Yield notliiqrito.;jnience," is the dictate
not more of xouraea than of noli y. It we
yield in thii' ndur'of pressure we are en
slaved lorever. yv e coma never recover irora
the dishonorable' imputation of having grant
ed to threats whet we refused to argument.
A great party must" respect itself, if it would
preserve the respect of the country and the
world.
Tbey talk to us of compromise. Without
stopping to, repjipyi -them that the present
difficulty tojpe fain their violation of a
past compromise let as ask what we can
make a cooipEmi. about. Either the ter
ritory now free must remain free, or it must
become slaie.' Xtyeihisist that it shall main
tain its present state of freedom; the South
says that its present state of freedom shall
be changed to slave There is here no room
for comprowis)l- JQjjt principle is right or it
is wrong. ,,'IL tt be. wrong, then not only
have we misre fhelesson of our history and
mistaken tKe' liirtt 'of our institutions, but
our fathershisirnaerstood the government of
their creation; if it be right, let us never
cease to maintain it; And least of all when we
are threatened for maintaining it.
They tell us that 'fugitive slaves ought to
be given uptl & tne y.ought. We fully admit
-hat "no personrbeld to service or labor in
one state, . under f he laws thereof, escaping
into another, fhal'in consequence of any law
or regulatka, (hrsin, be discharged from
such service lalior,, but shall be delivered
up, on claim' of the party to whom such ser
vice or kbor may be, due." This isapirtof
the original fundamental compact, one of the
compromises of the Constitution, just as much
as that other prpvjion that " the citizens of
each state'sfl&ft'a'entitled to all privileges
and immunities yf 'citiiens in the several
states." BMbUooia he sustained. If South
Carolina imprisons or expels northern citi
zens, if Georgia sends back northern travel
lers, if Texas, bangs northern missionaries, it
Vermont prevents the surrender of fugitive
slaves alU violate, the Constitution alike,
although trie" eriniei are of unequal magni
tude, as vitfteKWJ' rapine and murder are of
greater enormity td&a letting a slave go free.
Having admitted '-tne duty ot surrendering
slaves, we juixwid-to- k what the Republi-
party has Qona io .prevent tne aiscnarge ot
that dutn tnk-W4latfrm there is not a
single word on tha subject ; its candidates
elect have sAifLbaJhieg against it ; none of its
measures has evtr been aimed at it. But there
are, it is said, personal liberty statutes which
interfere wita -in reclamation ot fugitive
slaves. This we mean to show is a grave
mistake ; bttttramltring the fact, we reply that
the RepubScAn $aftjt, as such, is not respon
sible for these statutes. Republican New Y ork
has refuseS1 to' fc'uSS one: other ReDublican
states have ttaae ih same. Wherever they
have been passed they have been the expres
sion of a sen timent prevading the whole com
munity without regard to party, and receiv
ing democratic yoles among others.
Let us meanwhile not forget what has
created this popular sentiment. One cause is
undoubtedly the iconviction which has
grown in intensity, among us, as in the
rest ui ure tnvnreu wunu, iui uiuverj
is wrong. The other is the mo-t in
sulting and offensive Fugitive Slave act of
1850. That.w6 indeed an inhuman and in
famous staV.UVbf 'Which we ought, one and
all, to be ashamed. It offered a bribe to the
Judge to convict, by giving him double fees,
on giving op the person claimed. It allows
an

to the persoh'cljrinfed the right of testifying
to bis own freedom. And a single omcer,
holding his. ,ftige. at pleasure, is made the

become uita' talk; .'(If insufficient guaranties

tyrannousdict'tfAustria and Naples, while
such a laVaanMs remains upon the statute
book of Congress.
It would scarcely be too much to say that
nearly all the legislation of Congress lor the
last half eentery b leaned to one side, and
that the s;d ot slavery. It is time, too, that
this were" rigait-a. If Congress can pass a
law for the reclamation of fugitive slaves in
all tbeStki3i can, nnder the fame sanc
tion of the Cflasuitiori, pass a law for the
protection ot few otizena in all the States.
Let it pass a law to protect the New York
mechanicoiog, ,,to South Carolina, as
it passes oava Aofie(daim the Seuth Carolina
slave escapingciw York.
And when anacti a law for the reclama
tion of th49rTet 'l provide some guaranty
that nonej4sia?e shall be reclaimed. If
this be noLirfnfc hjt Congress, it is inevitable
that the Slates wUl protect their own free
citizens. And in providing for federal expo
sition of OiB'Ia"tet it give an equal chance
to the free and theBlare States. There are
new nine "JtliJa flf the Supreme Court, of
whom fivf am ram, the slave States, assigned
to circuits with a free population ot only five
millions, and ilsTave population of four, while
the rematrjingjaur. Judges are from the free
States, and.'Atsifa to a free population of
twenty millions. Equality of the States for
sooth! ,o;.::
Our counsel, to i Republicans is therefore
First To entertain no project t compro
mise, so long as we are menaced; second,
when the menace has ceased and concessions
are talked; ahcui.t;tp insist that the Fugitive
Slave acthaiV e.so amended as to provide
a permananiamiUunpartial judge, a jury of
the vicinage, ad,toe testimony of witnesses
without dtscrimkBSjtion between the nureuer
and the fugitive Jhirdly, that northern citi
tens entaring'&e.iSouth shall be as much the
object of fcdaiai -Solicitude as southern slaves
entering the jNprth ; and fourthly, that the
Supreme CJwtjUWdl be recognized, so as to
give a jncRV itoatfqual number of persons,
whether '-hc-? je:rAns be freemen or slaves,
the owners ofjiats or the owuers ot planta
tations. Let uj Lave np more compromises

would not pacify the cotton States. While
many Republicans admit their readiness to
repeal the offensive statutes "decently and in
order," I have not met a member who will
consent under threats of coercion.
OLD BEN WADE ON SECESSION.
It is quite refreshing to hear Senator Wade
on the absorbing topic. He swears in good
round Anglo-Saxon, with characteristic ve
hemence, rounding off his periods with a
ring ot tabooed expletives which would startle
the piety ot old-fashioned Psalm-singers. He
says "the Republican party won its triumph
upon distinct principles, openly aud clearly
announced from every stump in the country,
and d d if they shall budge an in:h." lie
arraigns the President for general imbecility,
upon the sec- xsion question particularly, tie
says "if the President denied the right of
secession, wh didn t he hold his tongue and
quietly transfer troops to Charleston, where,
if it should have proved necessary, he could
have used them, without disturbing the na
tion T It would have been merely changing
the soldiers' boarding-bouse. And if South
Carolina had been inquisitive, an answer
might have been given which she would have
readily comprehended." He is bitter npon
the course ot the South toward Northern men
in her jurisdiction, saying that "it the British
should hang a Yankee because he is a Yan
kee, there would be war in two hours ; but
the South hangs scores of men, and they beg
us to conciliate them." He is willing to do
everything that is right, but will submit to
nothing wrong. When secession comes up
in the Senate "old Ben Wade" will "talk out
in meetin'."
Amending the Constitution.
The President in his Message recommends
an Amendment ot the Constitution. The
mr.ik-a ot doing this, as prescribed by the Con
stitution itself, are two:
1st. Congress by a two-third vote, may pro
pose ?i Amendment. It must then be ratified
by three- fourths of the States, either through
their Legislatures or State Conventions, as
Congress may prescribe.
2d. Two-thirds of the Legislatures of the
Slates may require Congress to call a Nation
al Convention to propose Amendments. The
Amendments proposed by the Convention
must then be ratified by three-fourths of the
States, as in the other casa.
To initiate an Amendment, therefore, it is
virtually necessary to have the assent of
twenty-two States, and to perfect it, requires
the assent of twenty-five. A'Jmm) Journal.

On motion concerning the rortetence of the
President's message, Lane, vs Oregon, made
an apology for the dissolution ol the Union,
saying it must dissolve uuless the rights of
the South are further guaranteed.
Hale, of New Hampshire, said the logic of
this controversy is war or submission. 1 he
minority must submit to the majority. He
made no threats, and spoke without having
consulted anybody, he spoke for himself only
and one little State. "We. must look this
matter straight in theface."' -Brown of Miss.,
desired to know if Hale presented the issue
of war or submission. Hale said it must lead
to that. He made no threat. Brown replied
sternly: "We will not submit, and if it is
war let it come and God show the right."
Iverson of Ga., was quiet at first, but haugh-
tj and dcflaui la ine end. He accepted the
President s declaration that secession is rev
olution. "The States understand they do it
at the peril of consequences. He did not be

South is preparing to receive its enemies with
l loody hands and hospitable graves. He
hoped there would be no war, that we would
live in peace.
The South would regard the North among
the most favored of nations, and so treat
with her, but to remain in the Union she
would not. No power on earth could pre
vent her withdrawal. The repeal of all the

does not yield to overwhelming public senti
ment, some Texan Brutus will reach his heart,

Wigfall talked Senators out of their seats,
but he said one good thing. He said that he
disagreed wi n Haie. That Senator had said
the President's message was neither one thing
nor the other. Wigfall thonght it both one
thing and the other. j
Saulsbury, ot Delaware, made an earnest
and eloquent plea for .the Union, which was
received with thunders ot applause in the
galleries. He said Delaware was the first to
come into the Union and would be the last to
go out She would use all in her power to
preserve the Union. ' The disunion speeches
were received in profound silence.
Special to Cincinnati Commercial. New York Dailies--Newspaper Men.
A New York correspondent writes; there
is a slight flutter among the New York news
paper men, which is talked of so freely that
there is no impropiety in mentioning it for
the edification of the public Mr. W. H. Hurl
but, one ot the principal writers of editorials
for the Times, and one ot the most rapid, forci
ble, scholarly gentlemen connected with the
American press, proposes to dissolve his con
nection with that establishment on the 15th
of the present month. Mr. Hurlburt, like many
another man, took it into his head, when the
recent financial flurry was its height, to have
"a little dash at stocks," and marched in with
the boldness of a major from the State of
Georgia. Fortune favored the venture, and in
a tew days he made a large sum of gold more
than he could have realized in half a dozen
years in grinding out editorials for newspaper
at the regulation rate ten dollars per col
umn. So, disgusted with the drudgery of
his daily two columns of brevier or ambitious
of another large sum of gold, or touched with
an itching to tie in, or to be interested in a
journal in which he could with greater free
dom, "state his viewff ' on the current topics
of the time he goes out of the Times. I sus
pect that I am not tar out of the way in sup
posing that a vision of the latter Das passed

Mr. Wesley, lately one of the largest stock
holders in the Times, and a man of rare busi
ness capasity, is negotiating for the purchase
of the jfews, with the vie wof building np that
establishment so that in all respects it shall
be the peer of the Herald, Times, or Tribune.
He has the money, the experience, and the
pluck, and the field for success is ample. Mr.
Hurlbut is marked down as editor-in chief,
and Mr. Wilson, also one of the clever men of
the rtm,is spoken of as an associate. Wheth
