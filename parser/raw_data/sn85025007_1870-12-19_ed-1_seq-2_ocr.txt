"It may not be amiss to state a few plain
facts as to the matter of the Arlington estate.

to his fami'y only personal estates- No mention
of lands is made in it, because ho owned
none. The will itself bears date aDterior to the
war. G. W. P. Cur,tis died in 1857, and after
that General L-:e held a life estato in Arlington
as tenant by courtesy. It now belongs to
Mrs.Lee Irec from claim whatever, except a tax
title held by the United States government.?
Any lawyer knows that a court of equity would

to what lie actually paid ou!7 returned to him

now removed by the death of her husband, and

larceny?made a desperate effort to effect an
escjpo between 9 and 10 o'clock last Thursday
