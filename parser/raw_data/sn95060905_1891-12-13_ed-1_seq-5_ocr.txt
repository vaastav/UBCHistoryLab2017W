supposed. In running the road through

of ore will have to be done to get it on

The I-nst Kite.
The funeral of the late Murty Long
took place yesterday afternoon and
was attended by a large concourse of
friends of the deceased. Tho casket
was literally hidden from view by pro
fuse floral decorations, principally
roses and calla lillies. Many citizens
took a last look at his familiar face,
during the day, which had not the
appearance of death so natural did it
look. It had been his express desire
to his friend, Col. Haflbrd, that Mr.
Piatt, the chaplain or Burnside Post
G. A. R. should read tho burial 'ser
vice and his wish wos carried out. The
scene at tho grave was an expression
of tho esteem in which he was held
by those who knew him best.
Another Producer,
The Golden Rule mine at Dragoon
Summit upon which a fortune was
expended a fe w years ago is producing
now under a different management.
It will bo remembered that a 20 stamp
mill was placed upon tho Ttule but
never produced any bullion except
what came from the pockets of the
stockholders. The mill was sold last
year to Loss of the Central Silver Co,
near Casa Grande. It was moved over
there and placed on one of those
properties. The Golden Rule mine
wai relocated for non-assessment
work, prospecting began with results
so satisfactory that a shipment cf ore
was made, Again the results exceed
ed the expectations of the owners and
other shipments were made and more
work was done. At the present time
the mine iB in shape to take out a
carload per week which will be sent
to Pinos Altos, New Mexico where the
owners, Bell & Stevens have a mill
and concentrators. At this place the
ore will be concentrated. A force of
of mine men are at work on the mine
The Doming Advance in speaking of
the nine says that Mr. Bell is very
enthusiantic over his proporty and tha
he never touches a mine unless it will
pay. Tho ore which will be shipped
comes from a three-foot ledge.

George Christ Jr. did up the Daily

accounts for the non-appearance of

Christ Jr. took exception to tho tone

the building to the Monitor for ono
year. Christ Jr. took possession of
the premises, pied the forms, and re
fused to let Editor Houston inside.

The widely known Salton sea, in

pearing by evaporation. Civil Engineer
Fellows-who has been at Salton some
time for the Southern Pacific Rail
Road Co., and has taken soundings
and observations of the sea, reports
that nothing will bo left of the sea by
February 1st. It is lowering percept
ibly every day and is now only a

a lake may form at any time again
during the next few years, but can
never do much damage.
BLONDES AND SEASICKNESS.
I.leht-llalred 1'copln Cannot Stand a
Hough Sea.
Is there any mysterious reason now
unknown to the learned doctors why
people with light hair should become
seabick quicker than those with dark?
Yet, says the Chicago Tribune, Charles
Young1, clerk of tho bteamer City of
Chicago, Bays this is so.
"1 can toll 'em," Clerk Young said,
"as soon as they come on the boat
whether they are goin to be siek or
not. When I see a girl with light hair
and light blue eyes, who walks in with
a kind of uncertain gait, as if she did
not know exactly where she was step
ping, I say to myself: 'Young lady,
you'll be biek before we are an hour
out.' Hut when the black-eyed woman
comes, who walks on board tho boat
just ns if she had business there, I
know that any ordinary ben will not
affect her in the least.
"Three-quarters of tho people who
become seasick on this bteamer are de
cided blondes. You may laugh at this,
but I havo made quite a study of it, and
Ivwill tell you I am right. If wo had a
long run I suppose it would fetch them
all. My observation has been con
fined, of course, to. the sixty-mile run
across to St. Joe, where the sea in the
summer lime ought, according to my
opinion, to make nobody sick. But
these light-haired people will keel over
and want to die quicker than anybody.
Why is it?-
With this the philosophical clerk told
the cabinmaids to prepare for a bcasick
time. As the City of Chicago put her
nose outside the breakwater it was
soon proved that this precaution was
not in vain.

The fan is nn inseparable part of the
Japanese dress. A native is rarely
without a fi'n. It is his shelter from
tho bun, his notebook and his plaything.
Tho varieties of these paper fans,
says the Paper Mill, would form a
curious, collection in respect to form as

fan that was used in the days of ae-
elusion from the outer world was nor
more than five yen, or fifteen shillings;
but now they have been made to order
for foreigners as dear as two to three
pounds sterling.
The"general prices of ordinary fans
range from two shillings to guineas per
hundred.
Theio are many curious uses for fans
in Japan. The umpiie at wrestling and
fencing matches uses a heavy one,
shaped like a large butfe'rfly, the
handle being the body and rendered
imposiug by heavy cords of silk.
The various motions of the fan con

NEWS M WIRE.
THE GREAT CONTEST.
Washington The most remarkable
contest, in the opinion of old nd ex
perienced congressman, for the speak
ership of the house of representatives
that has taken p'ace for many years,
reached its last day this morning with
no material change in the situation
The attack on Springer's forces, de
signed to bring about a withdrawal of
the Illinois candidates, continues, but
Springer suid this morning that he
was not to be forced to retiro by defec
tions in his own ranks ; that he was
still resolved to' go before the caucus
and stick to the end.
' A great deal of indignation is ex
pressed by Springer's warmest sup
porters at the abandonment of his
canvass by members of his state dele
gation. Other candidates are still
confident of success. The two leaders
in the race still express confidence of
winning, but regard the situation as
serious and critical. Each man known
to be in doubt is kept in sight and no
persuasion is omitted to induce him
to definitely pledge himself It is
generally believed that not more than
220 members will go into the caucus.
Estimates given show the leaders
themselves are not far apart in their
calculations, and render it possible
that absentees or votes for minor can
didates, until their flag is buried and
the day lost, may bring victory one
way or another.
Washington The twenty-second
ballot was destined to mark the first
significant change of the day, Cable
and Mulberry abandoning Springer
and voting for Mills. Tarnsey left
Hatch and voted for Crisp. During
succeeding ballots the excitement was
intense. Shively had notified Cable
and Newberry that whenever they
deserted Springer for Mills, he and his
friends would vote for Crisp, The
threat was carried out, Shively and
Stout changingjo Crisp. Cribb and
Dearmanthen left Hatch and voted
for Mills. Immediately there was the
wildest excitement. Catchings and
others of Crisp's forces rushed from
the hall and into the headquarters of
Hatch. iTherewas a brief conference.
Catchiugs returned followed by Hatch
who voted for Crisp, and Byrnes and
Wilson of his state followed the lead.
This gave Crisp a lead of five votes.
The 23d ballot resulted: Crisp 100,
Mills 90, McMillan 19, Springer 13 and
Stevens 12. On the 24th ballot
Springer lost another vote to Crisp.
This was the only change but it gave
Crisp a lead of 6 over Mills. 25th, 2Gth
and 27tti ballots failed to show a
change. Then a recess was taken till
8 p, in. At the beginning of the 30th
ballot McMillan who had been stand
in the rear of the lobby, entered the
hall, lhanking his followers formally
he witudrew from the contest, amid
great applause. Changes came in
rapid succession and at the close of
the ballot Crisp stood with 114 votes
and Mills with 108. Georgia's candi
date was one short of a nomination,
Springer and his little band of follow
ers holding the balance of power.
Great applause greeted Springer as he
entered tho hUl. The suspense was
painful. Finally he said : "I desire to
be recorded as voting for Mr. Crisp."
The vote of Springer nominated Crisp,
and the applause which greeted the
announcement was deafening. Men
rushed simultaneously to grasp the
Illinois candidate and he was the re
cipient of an enthusiastic ovation from
the supporters of Crisp. Busoy, Stew
art and Holman followed their candi
date and voted for Crisp. Snow,
Byrne, Mertin and Fatton remained
on record as voting for Springer. So
the result of the final and decisive
ballot was: Crisp 119, Mills 105,
Springer 4, Stevens 1.

STATEHOOD.
Washington New Mexico and
Arizona will probably enter the Union
as Btates before the end of the present
congress. Utah will also be an appli
cant for admission, but lingering
traces of Mormonism will probably
keep her out. Enabling acts for New
Mexico and Arizona are likely to pass
next spring or summer, but these
states will not come into the Union
early enough to vote for President
next year. Bills for the admission of
all three territories will be offered at
the first opportunity by their dele
gates in Congress. It is quite prob
able that there will be no opposition
in either house to the admission of
New Mexico and Arizona if they are
not to vote for President next fall.

resulted from the destruction to them
might have caused- serious inconven
ience even -to strong firms. It was re
lief to discover that there has been no
complications on this account. The
securities which happened to be in
his office at the time were believed to
have been placed in the safes of the
Manhattan Railway company in the
adjoining offices on tho same floor and
the only loss of this kind was thought
to havo been a certificate for one hun

with his views upon the -result but
answered : "I have nothing to say to

"In commenting upon the result of
the contest Mr. Hatdh said: "I am
entirely satisfied with the result, I
voted for Mr. Crisp because I believed
he possesses in the most eminent de
gree all the qualifications to make an
able conservative successful speaker.
I have never at any time during this
campaign shared in the feeling against
Mr. Crisp, that he was not as able and
conscientious tariff reformer as Mr.
Mills or any gentlen.an in this con
gress. I am better satisfied with 'his
record on the silver question than that
of Mr. Mills. Since the latter gentle
