of our exchnngi'« have sted improve

and a general revision of thesysb m c-nt.oi
ling tire departments has b.vu iuau-uiate.*
throughout the 1 uioti. Portland. w.iuone
of the l«esi of fire departments, is not -i!.s.
tied with the facilities that liavc l.ntoiore
its pride and ixiast. and is taking meas
ures to secure greater • flleicney in stavii:.-
the mates of the territ'ie d. -troy. r while
San Franeiseo with a seiviee jirolnl-1\ now
equal to any in the world, is also di'Msint
•ways and mean* for promoting tlie e. niinoii
object.
The Chicago and Roslon calamities prove
that there is abs >1 u.tely no mali i ial of «r.i
btiildinj.9 can Ik' constructed, that is tin
proof in a large conflagration: that while
brick, stor.e and iron may resist an ordinary
degre 'of lirat. tiiey cniinblc or fuse b -fore
the tirev blasts of a great c«.r.l!a;r.'atioii as
readily as tin- light wooden structures of a
country village. Vntil some substance is dis
covered that will withstand the ordeal, nil
effort must necessarily in' directed towards
perfecting tho modes ot preventing and ex
tinguishing tires.
This subjei-t is one in wliie'.i o-.ir citizens
should feel a livtl.v inte rest. A steam lire
engine is an absolute lues s-ity. I! steam can
lio uscel to ael\ antagc in cities, it can In- intro
duced with much more proiK-icty in towns,
where the ntnnltor of expcriene-cil firemen is
small ami wheTc muscle and skill can be put
to a l etter use than working the i unips of a
hand outline. In a town like this, const ruet
oel almost e'litiri ly of wimm 1. under the prevail
ing breeze-a of Summer and Winter a tiro
won lei gain fearful he-aelway after [Kissing the
lK)unels within which our pre sent facilities
would be' of any service. In the elry season
the roofs of house's are like* piles of tinder,
that may qo ignited by a spark, and during
the inoioniont [>erioel. roaring tires ar.«l ex
plosive compounds used feir illumination rn
luineo thoelanger from within. Fortunately,
however, even in the business part of town,
the builelings are low and within e*asy reach
of largo strvams fre>iu the hose-: e-nnsoquently
with an ample supply of »vatcrand tlionie'ans
of applying it. the elangcr can be in a great
liu-asure averted. It is said to be tl'.c jwert e>f
wiselom in time e>f peace to prepare for
war. Will not pr.peity e.wncrs hotel the
warnings that are of almost daily recurrence?
t an we be taught by none but our own mis
fortunes? Can we expect exe lnptionfroui the
calamities that have t>cfallen more favored
conununiticM than our own? Vndcr these
i ire uinstane-e'B, what letter inve stme nt can be
elesii eel than the appropriation of a few hund
red elollars to improve our tire apparatus?
There is none 1 . E very body must concede that
the elangcr is great and the means available
to lessen it.
We trust that our contemporaries, who are
or should lie the guardians of the public in
terests. will agitate this matte r until the com
munity is aroused to action. Where there is
a will there is a way. and we have no fears
bat that, with united effort means will be de
vised to secure an efficient tire apparatus for
our thriving town.
Tire CASE OF WALLA-WALLA CVU NTV. - The
case against Kiger and his sureties, intlie Stt
jireme Court, bus attracted no little attention
and continent. It was argued at length last
Monday and Tuesday bv the attorneys on ei
ther side. Hon. X. T. Caton appeared in be
half of the county, and lion. 1!. 1,. Nharp
stein for the defense. Both gentlemen api>car
to have devoted much labor and research to
the question at issue, since the trial in the
lower court six mouths ago. The precedent
in like cases in nearly every Slate in the Un
ion has been obtained. It will lie remem
bered that the bond of Kiger was declared
defective and void in consequence of an in
terpolation of the amount after it had been
signed. The precedents afforded by nearly
all the decisions referred to ajp -ar to war
rant the belief that the legality of such
change turns upon the question of assent of
the parties signing the bond. Whatever may
be the final decision of the ease, the people of
Walla Walla county may feel assured that
their cause has been fully and ably presented
by Mr. Caton.
RAILROAD MATTERS. —The Kaluma Beacon
says that next year one hundred and sixty
miles will be completed from the Missouri
river to the Yellowstone at the mouth of the
Powder river, and two hundred and eight
miles from the Columbia, near the mouth of
Snake river, to Pen d'Oreille Lake. From
Kalama to mouth of Snake river, about three
hundred miles, there is good river navigation
including two railroad portages, and also Pen
d'Oreille Lake and tributary river there is
good navigation for one hundred and twenty
miles—so that at the end of 1873. the company
will have six hundred miles of steam com
munication at each end of the line, with a
gap of seven hundred miles to be completed.
DEATH OR A pioneer Fleming, one of
the first residents of Oregon City, and pub
lisher of tIA» flr*t ftewspaper on the Coast, the
Oregon Spectator, in ISM, recently died at
that place. He was l»orn in Pennsylvania and
was 77 yearn old. The Knterprise suggests
the propriety of a monument to his memory,
to be erected by the printers and pioneer res
idents of the Coast. We second the proposi
tion, and ho|»e the fraternity of Oregon will
effect some kind of organization to secure un
ity of action.
iMBOvBjfEXT.—Mr. S. X. Cooper U engaged
in enlarging his sash and dour factory, at
Tumwater, and contemplates increasing his
facilities for business until he can supply the
demand of the whole Sound. With the best
of machinery and skilled workmen, he turns
out work eipia] if not superior to any on the
Coast.
COOL SITPOBT.— The Courier refuses to pub
lish the Message of the (Jreat Ulysses, and
has not made the most remote allusion
to it in its editorial columns, lias the result
in November soured on its stomach, spiced
as it was by the condiments contributed by
this Territory V
C 7" We learn from the Dispateh that tli«
■■ iarlt'iHUastl, the i««i vuiraruiisid
*ea worthy, was recently sold at auction for
the sunt of ii.'JUU. The engineer of the
steamer Black Diamond was tiie purchaser.
The Tribtm? learns that several of our
merchants have recently ordered large sliij)-
menta of goods direct from New York. This
is a commendable policy, and we trust tiiat ,
the experiment will prove a success.

lViwci's Tn\ Co.—The New Northwest con
tains the follow Ing allusion to a firm of ladies
who have inaugurated a branch of business
e'ondueted exclusively by themselves and
which lias proved a complete success. The
company was organized in the city of New
York some two years since, under the finan
cial control eif Miss King, a wealthy re:.l
estate elealer of that city. A first clasa ship,
the Mad no Demon st. has been fitted up and
paid for. for the exclusive use of this compa
ny. and is the first ship ever owiuel and em
ployed by women in their commercial enter
prises. It will lie re meinbered that Miss
King visited tea-growing countries of China
and Japan, spending nearly two years in the
interior, often penetrating where no other
American woman had ever been, and collect
ing the purest tea used bv the natives. The
editor of the New Northwest says that dur
ing her rcevnt visit to New York she tnjoyeil
several delightful drinks of this beverage at
the headquarters of the company in the base
ment of Madam Demurest'.", Emporium 011
liroadway, and can say truly that this tea far
surpasses tho col union imported brands. The
tine quality of this tea commends it to prae*-
tieal 1 LSI re, and it is rapidly being introduced
into every town and village in the Union.
Madam Demurest, as I'resielent of the com
pany, tvinevs an executive ability of no com
mon order, and her financial intelligence is
only equalled by her ingenuity of taste as
queen of fashion and design.
IMPI-DCNT.— The Courier of M onday contains
the following paragraph:
"Will Hi" STAND«R.I) please pith'Ssli that card from MR.

We did not publish Mr. West'scard because
we believed its sole intent was to " white
wash " the Postmaster at Claquato. We have
consulted no "legal advice," but simply re
quested our informant to substantiate the
charge by proper evidence, or we should feel
it our duty to publish the denial. Soon as
we ascertain the facts they shall l>c given.
Until then, the demands of Mr. Hogue, or
his organ, will avail him nought. If he is
proven innocent, we will not only publish
the card but make the amende honorable.
The Courier appears to forget that this is
our dispute, and that its paragraph, therefore,
may very properly lie classed under the cap
tion of this article.
Zs~ An item is going the rounds of the Or
egon press alsmt a ' sniping" expedition that
occurred in this vicinity, a few weeks ago.
In justice to our young men we will state that
the "Smart Alecks" who held the sack and
candle on the mud-flats, were carpet-baggers
of a few months residence on the Coast. Our
boys have too much sense to be caught by
such stal? jokes.
XEW liwi.ufxus.—Mr. Barker is erecting a
large two-story building at the foot of Main
Street, and Mr. ltobt. Parker a fine residence
on Adams Street, while preparations to build
are being made in several other localities
altout town. Out-door laborers have lieen
delayed but little thus far in their operations.
THE WEATHEB.— The weather continues de
lightful. One would scarcely realize that
Winter has come, except in the decreased
length of the days and the chill that prevails
after nightfall. From present appearances
we are to have a mild season.
C7*The steamship California arrived yes
terday morning, with the largest cargo she
has ever brought to the Sound. More freight
was offered thai) she could carry, and a largo
amount remains stored in Portland awaiting

OrsiEH TIIADF..— Quite an important trade is
springing up with Portland in the side of oys
ters and clams. Messrs. Hawk A Manning
dispatch about fifty sacks of oysters each
week and a proportionate supply of clams,
and thus far they have been received at their
destination in good order. Several other par
ties also ship at intervals large quantities of
these bivales to Kalama, Portland, Vancou
ver and other places, and the demand has
steadily increased from the time transporta
tion was rendered possible by the comple
tion of the railroad to Tenino.
Oy The Express remarks that besides being
the favored rival in terminus expectations,
Tacoma owns more steamboat property than
any other port on the Sound, viz., steamers
North Pacific, Alida and Black Diamond.
The public school under the superintendence
of M iss Jaunic Torrence, has twenty scholars;
and the Good Templars Bodge is well kept up
by thirty attending members of the order.
Tacoma baing the natural outlet of the Puv
allnp Valley, makes in one of the busiest lit
tle town on the soun I. and her people should
1M- prosjicrious and contented.
RETIHEJIIINT OE JUDGE NEUMW.—A Washing
ton dispatch of the 3d inst., says that Associ
ate Justice Nelson, of the Supremo Court of
tliu United States had tendered his resigna
tion. Judge Nelson is over 80 years of age,
and his last ollieial act was signing the Treaty
of Washington, in the negotiation of which
he participated as one of tho high commis
sioners. The law provides that a Judge may
retire, if he desires, upon reaching the ago of
70, or alter ten years of service. The Presi
dent has appointed Hon. Ward Hunt to the
vacancy.
DEATH OF FKED FINCH.—It is with profound
regret we announce the death of Fred Finch,
in San Francisco, on the stli inst. Fred was
a young man of more than ordinary promise,
and being the only son of wealthy parents,
possessed unlimited means for a life of use
fulness and honor. His habits and conduct
were exemplary, and his friendship for his
associates steadfast and true. Although Ins
death was not altogether unexpected, it has
cast a gloom over the spirits of his friends in
the community which knew him so well.
RUNAWAY.—Tho horses attached to a carriage,
returning from tho funeral of Rev. Mr.
Dicky's little child, last Saturday, became
frightened and uninanagable, and ran the
vehicle against a tree. The tongue broke,
and the horses in (Kissing the carrige in ad
vance of them, overturned it and started the
other team. Alter proceeding some distance
both teams stoppedof their own accord and
were led to town. The parties in the carriages
sustained several bruises and scratches, but
were liott-eriously injured.
I. OSS BY THE OBEQON CITV FIBE.— The loss by
the burning of the Oregon City woolen mills
is not as large as at tirst reported. It has
Iteen ascertained that the lost on the building
was $19,625; on machinery 981,069, and on
wool, §58,343—a total of $159,040. There was
an insurance on the building $11,625; on ma
chinery, $27,125, and on wool $38,950—a total
of $77,500. This reduces the loss sustained by
the company to $31,530.
TACOMA. —The Tacoma Mill Company have
just erected a commodious store, warehouse
and barn, and have constructed a lino of tel

miles, to connect their town with the remain
