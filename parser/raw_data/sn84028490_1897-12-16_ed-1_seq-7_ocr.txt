TUB tBATIIKH AND BUOE THADK.
When pro'octlon papers talk of tho
groat shoe trade ot thta country, and the
millions exported yoarfy, they ought to
Bay It was not built up until Hides wore
admitted frco over twenty years ago,
This gave us cheap leather and the
Bhoe manufacturing business soon be
came a greet Industry.
Tho Dingloy tariff, now In oporatlon,
put hides upon tho dutiable list, but a
decision just rendered by the general
(government) board decldos that call
hides now must coaio In freo of duty.
Thb IMcKlnloy bill of 1801) when Intro
duced Imd hides down lor paying duty,
but tho pressure was too great and
hides were Anally, aftor u hot contest,
continued on the free list.
The following item from a protection
paper Is probably coirect, as far as It
goes!
During Iho month ol November tho
Boston Hlioc makers shipped 33 per cent
more goods than during tho correspond
ing month of 1802, tho shipments being
108,429 cases, Betldoa this hoavy orders
for next season aro on fllo and untouch
ed because of tho great demand for tho
present Benson's goods.
Comparing November 1807 with No
vember 1802 Is singular. The exports ol
leather and manufactures of leather in
1801 were $13,278 847; in 1802 our ex
ports of leather, etc., woio 812,031781
In 1893, $11,012,164; 1894. 814,282,420;
1895, $15,014,407; 1890, $20,242,750. v
It Will bo seen that 189 J wasjahead of
ench of tho five previous years, But it
may be stated that tho imports of
leather and manufactures ot, ran as fol
lows, beginning with the yoat 1891, $12,
083,303; 1802, $13,309,321; 1893, $15,087,
003; 1801, $9,415,145; 1895, $13,819,038;
1890, $13,400,142.
No doubt tho imports were dlflerent
in character from tbo exports. It is
well whon talking about experts to com
pare with imports in thosamo linos, and
by taking a few years is all tho better.
Among humbugs, however, a protective
tarlfl must have a high place. It Is
simply taxing not for a public purpose,
to put rovenue in the treasury, but to
put money In privato pockets. Govern
ment being tho agent of the wholo peo
ple shsuld not discriminate, but should
observe equality of rights, equal and ex
act justice. There is no other Bale rule.
ALASKA'S KUTTJHE.
When Alaska was purchased from
Russia in 1807 it was not supposed to be
nn event of any great importance. He
cent discoveries however havo changed
the outlook, and these important gold
discoveries Indicate important possibili
ties. There Is a (uturo for Alaska and it
is well that President McKinley in his
message urges upon congress tho exten
sion of civil authorUy within this "vast
and remote yet promising portion of our
country."
The area of Alaska is 514,700 squaro
miles, being about 1,100 miles long and
its greatest breadth from east to west
800 miles. With its numerous islands,
creeks and inlets, it has a coast range of
nearly 8,000 miles. From the main por
tion a narrow strip about 50 miles wide
extends south-east down the coast and
terminates at tbo confines of British
Columbia- in 64 40' north latitude.
Juneau, the capital, is 100 miles further
south than St. Petersburg, and Finland
extonds further north than Alaska and
Is inhabited by an intelligent people. If
tho new Siberian railway were extended
through Alaska, tbo greater part of tho
territory would be south of tho lino.
It is Bald the climato of Alaska is not
so Bevero as that of Siberia, boing modi
fied by" tho warm, ocean current that
washes tho shore and passes through
Behring strait. The present movement
will open up that region; and an es
tablished government will be necessary
as President McKinley recommends,
Rev. Thomas J. Keith, of Vincennes,
Ind., refuses a pention from the govern
ment. He was lieutenant in an Indiana
regiment, and was granted a pension
under the dependent law, having served
four years and six months. Ho doesn't
waut to be clossed as a ' dependent,"
and knows of no disability that entitles
him to tho government bounty. Ho
therefore refuses the pension and returns
$103.80 ho had received, Mr, Keith in a
published letter says: "My incomo is
less than $400 per annum, but I must be
right with God and my conscience A
moderate service pension to all veterans
would be loss expensive and more just
than tho multitude of very largo ones
issued on ovidenco often false and
fraudulent. One Presbyterian elder
draws $30 a month for alleged deafness
whllo in charge of a long distance tele
phone. God judges nations that wink
at perjury and rewards lrud.
The Republican fit. Louis platform of
last year demands tho recognition of
Cuban independence Mr, McKinley
endorsed this as did Senator Mark
Uannn. After Hanna took his Boat in
the senate, howevor, he voted ogalnst
locognlzing Cuban independence), and
the President uloo is opposed to recog
nition. These gentlomon don'vt eoom to
regard their plalforn now, being aftor
election.
Accumulation is all right in a country,
but when that accumulation goes into a
few hands, it shows tbo distribution is
all wrong. The increase of a millionaire
class in tills country' shows tho evil in
distributionshows that' something is
sadly out ol joint and Bhouldbe corrod
ed. Thls condition results irom the evil
legislation of tho Republican party.
Their cold standard find protection as
well as their bank system have been
working to bring about all this.
Lionel A. Sheldon, of Los Angeles,
Oal., formerly a congressman from Ohio,
then a governor of Now Mexico and
lately a delegate to the St. Louis con
vention which nominated McKinley,
has'inada public declaration of his iuten
tlon to join the Silver Republicans in
opposition to tho party as at present
iad, He believes bluietalllem oilers tho
only remedy for tho hard times, and de
clares that no tarlfl bill can be passed
which will yield sufficient revenue, and
that we ought to have a federal Income
and inheritance tax. Ills defection has
caused a stir in political circles on the
Puoiflo Blope. The failure of tho Wolcott
commission is qulto likely to Increase
the number of silver Republicans.
KKTIRINOTUK GRKKNBACKS.
We would not bo surprised to Bto Sec
retary Gage and tho administration re
tire before thoy succeed in retiring the
greenbacks.
Tho Republicans used to boast of the
greenbacks as a permanent arrange
ment. But these did not suit tho money
monopolists and speculators, not giving
them control, and so thoy got tho na
tional bank law. ,
For years tho money clique organs, as
did the party loaders, wero constant in
speaking high praise of tho national
work system. They pronounced It per
fection Itself. Nothing was ever equal
to It. In fact it was the grand handl
bank of the ingenious and brainy Re
publican party.
And now, according to tho same
learned and high authorities, tho system
needs repairing. In fact, it is a failure;
is not what wo noed; is not flexible, and
henco not suitable to the wants of the
dear and suflorlng people.
it seems thoreforo this great system,
with somo four thousand national banks
over the country, must bo rejuvenated
In order to give them flexibility, so that
thoy can help tho business of tho coun
try and restoro our lost prosperity.
Along with these clamorous demands,
it will be noticed, there is always some
addltlonol prlvltego required. It is tho
same old scheme of helping ourselves
under the pretense of bonoQtting others.
Bear In mind, these men wbojworship
at tho shrine of money and want to uso
tho governmont, aro working for their
own interest. Thoy want tho privilege
of issuing more noteBon their bonds and
these notes, of course thoy would loan
at the usual rate of interest. Retiring
the greenbacks would glvo the banks a
bigger opportunity by supplying tho
vaccuura.
MAYOR HAUHIBON'S GOOD WORK.
Mayor Harrison is entitled to tho cor
dial thanks of the public for the manner
la which ho forced through the council
the very desirablo ordinance for track
elevation. For one reason and another
several of the aldermen Bought to delay
the passage of tho measure. Thoy want
ed it sent to ono of tho committees,
where it might be maneuvered to the
satisfaction of the committeemen and
themselves.
But the mayor, who has taken his
stand for tho people against tho in
fringement of their rights by corporate
interests, thought otherwise. Mr. Har
rison remembered, doubtless, that lor
years during which the grade-crossing
horrors have formed part of the weekly
record of city llfo tho necessity of im
mediate action for track elevation has
been growing more and more apparent.
Had tho track-elovation ordinance been
delayed in Thursday night's session tho
work of nbolishing tho deadly crossings
at grade would have been put back in
definitely. The mayor settled tho mat
ter once aud for all by making it ap
parent to the aldermen that juggling
with this important measure would not
bo tolerated. Chicago Record.
Track elovation has got to come in
other cities. It is simply horrible the
loss of life in this country irom grade
crossings. These murderous doings do
not occur in Europe, for grade crossings,
as a rule, aro not allowed.
The two great strikes threatened in
England are averted for tho present.
Tho railway employes concluded not to
paralyze travel and traffic' during the
holiday season and so continue to work,
Tho Lancashire cotton manufacturers,
who said they could not and would not
run their mills unless there was a cut of
6 per cent in wages expenditures, dis
covered, as soon as thoy learned the de
termination of the men not to work at
the reduction if every factory stopped
and remained closed indefinitely, that
thoy might bo able to make a living at
the old rates after all, and so agreed to
tho men's terms. Tho railway engineers'
strike continues, however, bb they failed
to come to terms.

DINGLUY'S BLUNDERING.
In a published interview Mr. Dingloy
puts on nirs and defends his tariff law
and its deficiencies, saying that people
who he savs are tho champions of tho
Wilson tariff, and who "are pointing out
the failure of the Dingley tariff, "do not
dare to make comparisons betwoen the
first months of the Wilson act and the
first mouths of the present act. Now
that is just what they do. Mr. Dingley
seems to hnvo overlooked the annexed
table, showing the returns of customs
revonue under tho first tour months of
the two tarlfl -j:
Wilson Dingley
Act. Act.
First month ?15,504,fl90 f 0,037,702
Second month 11,002,118 7,013,100
Third month 10,250,002 0,013,1114
Fourth month 11,203,010 0,830,025
Four months f 18,000,810 (3-1,471,321
It is to be added that in its filth
month the WilsoD tariff produced 117,
3t31,000' customs revenue, in its sixth
13,334,000, and in Its soventh N4.029,
000. These revenues under the Wi'son
tarjfl were when trade was paralyzed by
the' panic of-1893. Tho four months of
the Dingley tariff, given in the above
table, are at a period when the country
is declared to be on the high wave of
prosperity. Dingley's blundering don't
pan out.
Tbo unprincipled, and now unpopu
lar Governor Tanner, of Illinois, called
the legislature in extra session and it is
now at work redistricting that state for
congressional purposes especially putting
Chicago in shape so aB to give tho Demo
crats as little chance as possible, Tho
Democrats havo tho mayor and council
in Chicago and have a bill up to change
the wards which will In eomo cases throw
prominent Republicans in the same
wards, who are not now. Under tho
new contemplated arrangement thoy
may have a chance to contend with one
another. It may be beautiful.
In discussing tho Cuban policy of
the present administration at Washing
ton, the ilrt thing to remember 1b that
the St. Louis platform declares for the
rf cognition of Cuban independence, and
Mr. McKtnloy endorsed it. This ad
ministration is in the same line of Cuban
policy that Grovor Cleveland was, and
even contluues Fitzhugh Lee as consul
at Havana. A change of administration
lti Spain has relieved American prisoners
in Cubo. Ah to gold standard and Cuba
there Is no diflerence between Cleveland
and McKinloy policy.
Immense sums aro being invested
right along in costly war ships by all
governments, as they aro able. These
new armored vessels have not as yet
boen tried, fully. The China-Japan war
wus not a contest of much account as to
drawing important conclusions. Tieso
armoured ships, with their enormous
guns of great oxploslvo power, have not
yet been tested iu a serious determined
war between two great powers; and
there is no immediate prospect ut
present.
Comparing tho Republican National
platform with the President's late mes
sage on Cuba proves again that "plat
fotms aro made to got in on, not to
stand on."

THE WHOLE TRUTH.
Quostlons Whon Askod by a Malo
Frooly to Mrs. Plnkham.
u tnoso painiiu anu trouuicsomo disorders pecu
liar to their sox.
There can bo no moro terrible ordeal to n dollcato,
sensitive, refined woman than to bo obliged to an
swer certain questions when thoso questions aro
asked, oven by her family physician. This is cspo
cially tho caso with unmarried women.
This la tho reason why thousands nnd thousands of
women nro now corresponding with Mrs. I'iukham.
To this good womnn thoy can and do glvo every
symptom, so that she really knows moro about
tho truo condition of her patients through her
correspondenco than tho physician who per
sonally questions them. Perfect confldcnco and
candor aro at onco established between Mrs.
Plnkham and her patients.
Years ago women had no such recourse
Nowadays a modest woman asks help of a
woman who understands women. If you suffer
from any form of troublo peculiar to women,
wrlto at onco to Mrs. Plnkham, Lynn, Mass.,
and sho will ntlvlso yon free of charge.
And tho fact that this great boon which la
extended freely to womon by Mrs. Plnkham, Is
appreciated, tho thousands of letters which aro
received by her prove. Many such grateful let
ters ns tho following arb constantly pouring in:
" I was n sufferer from fcmnlo weakness for
about a year and a half. I have tried doctors
nnd patent medicines, but nothing helped me.
I underwent tho horrors of local treatment, but
received no benefit. My ailment was pronounced
ulceration of tho womb. I suffered from in
tenso pains in tho womb and ovaries, and tho

Not Only In Canton But In Every
City and Town In the Union,
If the reader took tho time to ask his
fellow residents of Canton the simplo
question propounded below ho would
obtain the one answer, If he had the
curiosity to read tho statements now
published in Canton which refer to this
answer It would surprise him to note
that thoy number between thirty and
fifty. As many more could bo published
but in the meantime ask tho first man
you meet what cure3 backache? The
answer will bo Doan's Kidney Pills.
Here is ono case of the many we have:
Mr. Wm. Wells, of 201 West 2nd street
says: "Whon a lad I came over from
England on the old sailing ship Atlantic
and whon walking on the slippery deck
I fell and hurt my back against a cable.
It was a severe fall and nearly killed me
but I pulled through although ever
since I have had weak kidneys. Back
ache, twinges of pain visited me regu
larly when I was serving mv time in tho
Brooklyn Navy xard and ever since dur
ing all the years that pusaol I was a vic
tim to tho attendants of weak kidneys.
When I caught cold I always had a spell
of inconvenelnt urinary weakness com
ing on without a moment's notice
and I was constantly and persistently
trying to get rid of my troubles. To
me help was everything nnd when I saw
a number of accounts in tho newspaper
about Doan's Kidney Pills, I thought
they at least might give me some relief
even If thoy did not cure. I got a box
at Durbln, Wright Co.'s drug store and
took them. Now I used medicines of all
kinds and wore plasters but Doan's
Kidney Pills havo done for me more
than anything I over tripd. I recom
mend them to all my friends and will
continue to do so"
