know what position the President would
take on the taritf; whether he would surrender
to the majority element of his
party and the Mugwumps, or whether he
would restsuro American industry by
planting himself unujuivocally on its side.
The President takes his stand on the
wrong eidt?on the tarifT plank of the
Democratic platform, on the side of the
"revenue reformers."
' The fact," says the President, "that '
our revenues are in excess of the actual I
needs cf an economical administration of
the government, justifies a reduction in J
the amount extracted from the people for
its support." This, in face of the further
facts that gross receipts are fast diminishing?
nearly $Vi>,COO;000 less in 1885 than
in lfe'84, and fstimated at about $8 000,0001
less in the fiscal year 188Gthunin 1885; that |
the fast falling annual surplus will, according
to the cflicial ef-tiinatcs, give way
to a deficiency of $24,500,000 in the next
fiscal year; and that the country demandsi
and tho President recoinuieuda the build-1
ing of a navy.
But the country is more interested to
know (1) which or Hie revenues inerremdent
is desirous of reducing, and (2) alocg
which line he proposes to strike. He. is
good enough to make his idea reasonably
clear.
(1)"The piopcsiticn with which we
have to deal iB the reduction of the reve-i
uuo received by t ho Government and in-1
directly paid by the people from customs
dities."
(2) "I think tho reduction should be
made in the ravenuo derived from a tax1
upon the imported necessaries of life." I
It is evident that the President has imbibed
the free trade tincture. He regards
the tariir aa a tar neceajarily piid by tho
consumer. Within a year cut nails have I
sold at forty cents a keg above the duty on |
them; there are noue imported?is this
tariff a tax on the consumer? But it is |
not necetsary at this time' to pursue this
branch of tho subjtri?prices of manufactured
products to day aa compared with
prices of like commodities under a tarill'l
t )T revenue only make their own argu-1
ment.
If the President has investigated the
subject he is aware that reduced tariff
ratea are not an abeolute remedy for ex-1
ceesive diatoms revenue; that, iu fact,
their first effect may easily be 10 sweu me
receipts from this source, and this would
continue until the purchasing power of
tho peoplo had been seriously impaired
by the injury of their industries and consequent
loss of employment. That, on the
other hand, customs revenues may be
diininifched by increasing the duties to a
prohibitory point, iB an obviouB proposition,
and sucli diminution, if skillfully
brought about, would leave intact the industrial
energies of the country.
If Congress were to follow tho President's
advice, so confidently given, and
make the reduction of revenue on the
"imported necesiaries of life," Congress
would be doing what England very ardently
hopes we may do. From what
nny be considered the necessaries of life
we collected last year 70 percent of the
whole customs revenue. These articles
embrace sugar and molasses, wool, cotton,
iron and steel, silk, flax, hemp jute,
chemicals, dyes, drugs, hides and skins
and their several manufactures. If we
invite larger importations of these commodities
we displace to that extent Amoricni
labor. Follow out the President's)
thought, and Congress will also lay its
hands on salt, coal and lumber, in which
West Virginia among other States is interested.
There is no guaranteo that rednced
duties, or no duties, on "the necessaries
of life" would greatly lower prices to
consumers. Tho abolition of the coffee
duty is a case in point. But it may be
granted that the effect would be as tho
President anticipates?to "lessen the cost
of living to every . family in' tho land."
What would be the net gain if by that
very reduction of price the power to
purchase wero soriously impaired or destroyed?
If wool is to be grown and
manufactured elsewhere, if iron is to be
mined and turned into useful forms in
other countries, K is of little moment to
the wool grower, the operative in tho
woolen mill, the coal and iron miner, tho
man heretofore employed in making iron
or steel?it is of little moment to him that
he has as a compensation a wool hat or a
jack-knife at a reduced price.
Plentifulness of employment at fair
wages is what a country needs; without
this more cheapness of commodities will
till no stomachs and cover no backs. A

dAy'a labor ia not likely to envy the men
who can buy a better hat lor ten centa but
lacks the ten centa. Employment ia tho
very first of tho neceaaariea of life. A protective
tariff ia on the aide of employment.

Aa "Joaiah Allen's Wife" Miaa Halley
his come to ba known as one of the moat
delightful of our American satirists. Her
shafts are not brutal, though thpy are vory
keen. She "shoots folly as it flies" and
forces those who accompany her to enjoy
the target practice. In her new book,
"Sweet Cicely," in which she does up
Joaiah Allen aa a politician, ahe embraces i
an opportunity for some of her moat effec- '
tive work. The book ia filled with "harm* j
less merriment," and for the blues, or aa
a diet for thin people to got fat on, "Sweet 1
Cicely" may be recommended with great
confidence. A hundred illustrations, and t
a handsome gold cloth covor, are worthy *
of niontion.?Funk dc WagnaUt, New Yuri. '

"Tho Book Buyer" swells out its fair !
proportions for the holiday season and is
filled with choice things. The full-page c
portrait for this month ia of Mr. Frank 11.
Iftockton, whose principal stories are the
lelight of thousands, and whose "Rudder
jrange" has just been republished in
England. The illustrations are numerous
ina of bish quality.?Charlet Scribncr'i

"Book News" for December is a double
holiday number, handsomely printed on
good paper and therefore showing to ex client
advantage the engraver's embellishments.
"Book Neva" is intended to
brims the buyer into relations with its enterprieing
publisher.?John W'awamaker,
Philadelphia.
London Fr?a? on Cleveland'* Mating*.
The Newt editorially says: "President
Cleveland's message seems to place him
in true succession to the greater men who
have occupied the Presidential chair,
rather than to the late Democratic line.
It is conceived in a most just and friendly
spirit towards all foreign Powers and contains
no word to tickle the ears of American
Jingos. The meesage expresses a sentiment
of international good-will. It is
equally wise and prudent on all domestic
topics."
The Foil says: "Some of tho old world
statesmen might ponder with benefit over
Mr ('luv/.lun/i'u ri'diinna t/Hinhinv th?
Nicarauguan treaty."
The Standard nays: ''The message is
temperate and dignified. The message
contrasts very favorably with some of the
wild dispatches of Mr. frelisghaysen and
Mr. Blaine. Mr. Cleveland's policy on
the whole id worthy of adoption."
The Times questions whether the President's
ineesuge will occupy bo large a
space in the thoughts of the world as the
death of Mr. Vanderbilt. It says: "Thousands
will speculate to-day upon the results
of Mr. Vanderbilt'a death with an
eagemees which events of large place in
history fail to excite. The President's
message reflects in traaquil and unexciting
paragraphs the happy detachment of
cointernational iealouites which it is the
peculiar good lortuue of America to enjoy."
Off the Track?Child llurnod.
The Massillon accommodation on the
Cloveland, Lorain A Wheeling, due at
Bridgeport Tuesday at 10:15 a m , was derailed
at Wheeling Valley, about five
muen out, ana ma not get m uu z v. m.
The cause of the accident was the breaking
of an axle on engine No. 10, which
was drawing the train. No aerioua injury
was done the trainmen or passengers,
although the entire affair was pretty well
shaken up and narrowly escaped rolling
into Wheeling creek.
At 10 o'clock Tuesday morning a twoyear-old
daughter of Charles Johnson fell
into a lira crate near by. Her clothing
took tire, and thero being no one in the
room to extinguish the flames, the child's
face was horribly burned. Her recovery
is doubtful.

with suicidal intent Tuesday. She
will recover.

A Glenvillo paper says: 'Trees."
Springston, the tearless deputy marshal,
was in Ulenville Friday with a prisoner, a
young McCfhnbers, who had been violating
the revenue laws. Ha gave bail here
for his appearance at Federal Court at
Parkeraburg in January. Whilo ontho
tour Press arrested Reed, a notorious character
of this <ounty, and lodged him in
thecouutyjail. Heed is indicted in soveral
cases in the Circuit Court of this county,
and will likely be taken in hands when
Uncle Sain is through with him. When
taken he was well armed, but he quailed
beforo Springston's big bull dog six
shooter, and kindlv consented to doobedi
ence to the urgent demand of the Government.
Down in Calhoun another violator
was hunted down aud ia now languishing
in jail. Press proposes to break up lawlessness.

At tho Haskell Indian Institute ono of
the young braves was being questioned in
history as to the characteristics and cus>
touiB of tho North American Indians. He
said they were noted for bravery and
throwiug the tomahawk, and they subsisted
on the fruits of the chase. The teacher
asked him if they did not follow agricul-1
ture. lie said they did. "Well" said the
teacher, "what did they raise?" The
young buck paused, scratched his head
and yelled triumphantly: "Corn and
