A claim of n citizen of tho United

mitted on the high bw by tho" French
authorities, In the exerelao of belligerent

tho Government of Franco with n pro-
position to defer (settlement until a mu
tual convention for tho adjustment of
nil claims of citizens and Miblects of
both countries, arising out of tho recent
wars on this continent, shall bo agreed
' upon by tho two countries. The sug
gestion Is not deemed unreasonable, but
It belongs to Congress to direct tho man--
ner In which claims for Indemnity by
foreigners, as woll as by citizens 9f tho
United States, arising out of tho late
civil war, shall bo adjudicated nnd do
termlnod. I havo no doubt that tho
Btibject of all such claims will engage
your attention ut n convenient and

It Is n matter .of regret that no con
Biderablo advauco has been made to-
wards an adjustment of tho differences
botweon tho United States and Great
Britain, arising out of tho depredations
upon our national commerce and other
. trwnruwes committed during our civil
,.war by British tubjects, In violation of
International law and treaty obllgtv
tlons. The delay, ) owever, may bo be
lieved to havo resulted In no Binall de
gree from tho domestic situation of
Great Britain. An entire cliango of
ministry occurred in that country dur
ing tho last session of Parliament. The
attention of tho new ministry was call
ed to tho subject at an early day, and
there Is boiiio reason to expect that it
will now bo coiibldeicd In a becoming
and friendly spirit. Tho Importance of
nn early disposition of tho nucstion can
not bo exaggerated. Whatever might be
tho disposition of tho two governments
it is manifest that good-will and friend
'eltlp between tho two countries cannot
bo established until a reciprocity, In tho
practice of good-faith and neutrality.
Khali bo restored between tho respective
nations.
Tlin FENIAN INVASION".
On tho sixth of Juno last, in violation
of our neutrality laws, a military expo'
dltlonmidontorprlsoagainst tho British
North American Colonies was projected
and attempted to bo carried on within
tho territory nnd jurisdiction of the
United States. In obedience to the ob
. ligation imposed upon tho Exccutivo
by tho Constitution, to sco that tho laws
aro faithfully executed, all citizens were
warned, by proclamation, against taking
part in or aiding such unlawful proceed
ings, and tho proper civil, military, and
naval officers were directed to take all
necessary measures for the enforcement
of tho laws. Tho expedition failed, but
it has not been without its painful con
sequences. Somo of our citizens who,
It was alleged, wero engaged in tho ex
pedition, have been captured, and havo
been brought to trial, as for a capital
offence, In tho Provlnco of Camilla.
Judgment nnd sentonco of death havo
been pronounced against soino, while
others havo beon ncquitted. Fully be
lloving.tho maxim of government, that
sovorlty of civil punishment for mis
guided persons who havo engaged in
revolutionary attempts which havo dis
astrously failed is unsound and unwise,
such representations have been mado to
tho British Government, In behalf of
tho convicted porsons, as, being sustain
ed by an enlightened and humane judg
ment, will, It is hoped, induce in their
case3 on oxcrc'iso of clemency, and a ju
dicious amnesty to all who wero engaged
in tho movement. Counsel lias been
employed by tho Government to defend
citizens of tho United Statos on trial for
capital offences in Canada; and a dis
continuance of tho prosecutions which
wero instituted, in tho Courts of tho
United States against thoso who took
part in tho expedition has been directed.
I havo regarded tho oxpedltiou as not
only political In its niture, but as also
In a great measure foreign from tho
-United States In its causes, character,
and objects. Tho attempt was under
stood to bo mado in sympathy with an
insurgent party in Ireland, and, by
striking, at a British Province on this
continent, was designed to aid In obtain
ing redress for political grievances
which, it was assumed, tho people of
Ireland had suffered at the hands of tho
British Government during a period of
soveral centuries. Tho persons engaged
In it wero chlolly natives of that coun
try, somo of whom had, while others
had not, becomo citizens of tho United
States under our general laws of natur
a-'ization. Complaints of lnlsgovern
ment iu Ireland continually engago the
attention of tho British nation, and so
great an agitation Is now prevailing In
Irelund that thu British Government
have deemed It necessary to suspend tho
writ of Imbeaa corpus In that country.
Theso circumstances must nccmuirlly
modify tho opinion which wo might
otherwise havo entertained In regard to
an expedition expressly prohibited by
our neutrality laws. So long as these
laws remain upon our statute-books,
they should bo faithfully executed, and
if they oporato harshly, unjustly, or op
pressively, Congress alouo can apply tho
remedy, by their modification or repeal.

Political and commercial Interest's of
tho United States are not unlikely to bo
affected In Somo degreo by ovents that
aro transpiring In tho eastern regions of
Europe, and tho tlmo seoms to havo
coino when our Government ought to
have a proper diplomatic representation
intGrocco.
TO LI Til' A I. EX V L A N AT I ON'.
'This Govermnent has claimed for all
porsons not convicted, or nccip-od, or
suspected of crime, an absoluto political
right of self-expatriation, and a choleo
ofi'now national aljegianco. ,3Iotof tlio

to hold Mich of their subjecta n'l havo
Immigrated to and been naturalized In
tho United Slates, and Afterward re
turned on transient visits to their native
countries, to tho performance of mili
tary service In like manner as resident
subjects. C'omplrtlnU arising from the
claim In this respect made by foreign
Slates, have heretofore been matters of
controversy between tho United Stales
and somo of tho Kuropcan Powers, and
tho Irritation consequent upon tho fail
ure to sottlo tills question Increased
during tho war in which Prusda, Italy,
and Austria wero resontly engaged.
Whllo Great Britain has never acknowl
edged tliorlHtt of expatriation, sho has"
not practluidy lusUto 1 upon It. France
has been equally forbearing, and Prus
sia has proposed a compromise, which,
although evincing Increased liberality,
has not boju n-jajpto I by tho Uaitod
States. Peace is now prevailing every
where iu Kurope, and tho present scorns
to be a favorable tlmo for an assertion
by Congress of tho principle, so long
maintained- by the Executive Depart
ment, that naturallzalton by one State
fully exempts the native -bom subject of
any other State from tho performance
of military service under any foreign
government, bo long as he does not
voluntarily renounce Its rights and
bench ts.
CONCLUSION.
In tho performance of a duly imposed
upon mo by the Constitution, 1 huvo
thus submitted to tho Bepresentatlve-i
of theStatesaudof the people such Infor
mation of our domestic and foreign af
fairs as the public Interests seem to re
quire. Our Government is now under
going its moat trying ordeal, and my
earnest prayer Is that tho peril may bo
successfully and finally passed, without
Impairing Its original strength and sym
metry. Tho Interests of tho nation are
best to bo promoted by tho revival of
fraternal relations, tho complete ob
literation of our past differences, and the
relnnuguratlon of nil tho pursuits of
peace. Directing our efforts to thoearly
accomplishment of these great ends, let
us endeavor to preserve harmony be
tween tho co-ordinate Departments of
tho Government, that each in lis proper
sphcro may cordially eo-operato with
tho other in securing tho malntonanco
of tho Constitution, tho preservation of
tho Union, and the perpetuity of our
freo institutions.

HLOOMSIiUItO, KATUP.DAY, DEC. S, PW.
Tho Prosidont'o Message.
Ve present to our readers the Message
of tho President of tho United States,
sent to tho opening session of Congress.
It is perhaps the best Slato paper ho
has yet promulgated, and wo are glad to
observe that the President does not in
tho least abate from his well understood
position iu favor of tho admission of
loyal Senators nnd'Hcprcsonlatlvcs from
tlio Southern States at once. Jle pro
ceeds to argue, that in all the recent leg
islation of Congress, the status of that
portion of tho Union lately in rebellion
has been recognized as Stales, and that
now It Is too late to assume and treat
them as Tenitories. In tho matter of
levying and collecting taxes, in the Ju
dicial proceedings of the national courts,
in tho Executive department by Procla
mation of Peace, and In other modes and
manners, repeated olllcial acts havo trea
ted tho Southern States as States; and
the President repeats his earnest hope
that the Southern States will very soon
bo admitted to seats in tho legislative
branch of tho Government, and to all
their rights under tho Constitution nil
equal , so vereign,and independent States,
Tho Message contains, and gives a
succinct statement of tho finances of tho
United States, shows tho very agreeable
fact of n reduction, during tho year end
iug thirty-flr.it October, 1800, of $a)U.
3T.)filV; tho debt being now stated at
S2.,!j1,:U0.000, or in round numbers at
two billions and a hair. It is thought
that tho rate of reduction will continue
at an advanced ratio.
Tho condensation of tho reporls of tho
War,Xavy,anl Po-t-Olllce Departments
Is equally satisfactory, and gives a suf
ficiently full exposition of tho respect
ive departments. And wo refer to tho
Mossngo Itself for more full information.
Tho President recommends a law pro
viding for tho election of a delegate to
Congress from tho District of Columbia,
in order that tho people of the District
may bo heard when laws are proposed
referring to their interests.
Tho reference to our foreign affairs
shows that so far as tho President is con
cerned, tho honor of tho United States
and our prestlgo among the nations bhall
bo maintained. Tho affairs of Mexico
aro fully discussed, reference Is made to
our British complications and tho Fen
Ian question, and a fidl statement of thu
present position of all concerned.
No reference whatever Is mado by tho
President to tho pending Constitutional
Amendment, nor to tho question of suf
frage In tho Slates. It was doubtlc
wise in the President not to discuss tho
question in his Annual Mossago, and to
avoid as much as possible, consistent
with hla duties, tho introduction of top
ics of dispute nnd disagreement.
Wo havo no Idea that Congress will
admit tho South to representation, or
inauuoy win permit uo restoration oi
tho Union for which so much bloodomd
treasure wore given. ,Ou that question
tho President and Congress stand jW
where they did last session. Tho Dem
ocratic parly occupied an Independent
position, ready at all times to iwsist In
tho restoration of tho Union upon tho
principle of tho equality and integrity
of tho States, nnd tho doctrine of tho
superiority of tho whllo raco.

We shall begin tho regular publica

one thousand subscribers, and business

field for extending their trade which is
thus afforded them. Wo know they
aro shrewd enough to avail themselves
of tho advantage thus offered, and to

Tho Namo
Op tho Democratic Newspaper, to be
issued about Xew Year,- will be an
nounced in duo time, and we greatly
doubt If any guess or conjecture iu tho
meanwhile will succeed In divulging it.
An examination of tho mailing-book
of tho now Democratic paper satisfies
usthat tho men who, for a quarter of a
century, havo been tho actlvo workers
in tho Democratic parly in Columbia
County, aro its earnest supporters ; and
in every locality tho stern and unyield
ing defenders of tho party and Its prin
ciples and Its organization aro among
its patrons. Whllo wo are not nt liberty
to namo the stockholders, wo can say
that they havo all been honored by tho
party to which they belong, and enjoy
Its full confidence.
The newly elected Associate Judges
lions. Peter K. Herbeln anil Irani Derr,
took their scats on tho Bench at tho last
court. They aro well acquainted with
tho people of tho county, and havo their
entire confidence. We know they will
perform their duties with Judgment and
fidelity, and with entire Impartiality.
Associate Jimmies M'Uevnoi.d-j

Willi tho ronpoct of tho entire county.
Courteous to tho Bar; attentlvo to suit

alive to tho publlenTlcrests of tho peo

nity. We observe that Senators Cowan,
Doolittlo, and Dixon havo been dis
placed from tho chairmanships of their

small business, as Senator Cowan has
only till March fourth to servo.

Tho undersigned having been ap
pointed by your Board of Committee
to audit tho accounts of tho Treasurer
of said Board, leg leave to report that
they havo examined hi? accounts nnd
vouchers nnd find that all tho money
collected from tlio stockholders has been
paid out for material and labor for tho
building.
Tho Commlttco visited thobulldlngln
company with some of tho stockholders,
who Joined the Committee iu express
ing perfect confidence In the manner In
which tho building Is being put up. The
material In the way of foundation stone,
lumber, etc., Is better than tho contract
calls for, and tho Commlttco nro well
satisfied thnt the contractor intends that
tho building shall bo second to none In
thu State, for tho purpose for which It Is
designed. Iu conclusion, your Commit
tee would congratulate the stockholders
and community upon tho prospect of
having a High School that will confer
not only honor upon those who attend
but upon the town nnd county. Your
Commlttco would suggest that tho ail
vanced state of the work requires the
prompt payment or the several install
incuts called In by tho Board, and that
Mr. Woir, tho Collector appointed, be
Instructed to proceed with the collection
Immediately.
All of which Is respectfully submitted.
