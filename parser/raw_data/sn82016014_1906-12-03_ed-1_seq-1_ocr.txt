Congress Is Inaugurated

Spectators on Hand.

SHIP SUBSIDY HEN.
Are Insistent for Some Action

N. The Japanese Exclusion Ques
tion Coming to the Front.
Washington, Dec. 3. Victors and
vanquished foregathered In the hall of
the hnuse today to congratulate and
sympathize with one another over the
results of the Xovember ballot.
The crowds came early and when
the speaker's gavel fell at 12 o'clock
the galleries were jammed with gaily
dressed women who added much to
the I'icturesqueness of the scene. The
Appearance of Speaker Cannon was
the signal for a hearty round of ap
plause from both members and the
pailerv which lasted until he brought
the gavel down convening: the last
session of the Fifty-ninth congress.
Immediately following: the prayer of
the chaplain the roll was called by
Mates.
Both visitors and members found the
great building in excellent shape to re
ceive them. Vast as Is the structure,
it has been thoroughly renovated, both
Inside and outside during the recess and
it looked as clean and inviting as many
a newer building. All of the commit
tee rooms have received a thorough
overhauling; the pictures have been re
juvenated and the two chambers com
pletely cleaned up.
Senators and members of the house
began to arrive early in the day and
there were many cordial greetings in
the corridors and on the floors. The
experiences of the late campaign were
a fruitful source of remark, but al
though many of the meetings were be
tween Republicans . and Democrats,
there was no evidence of any but the
best feeling. The newcomers generally
expressed the opinion that the short
session would witness little legislation
beyond the passage of the appropria
tion bilis.
"But it anyone thinks we will not find
something to talk about, he has an
other guess." said one of them, and
there was general acquiescence.
The house adjourned at 12:63 p. m.
Foraker to Start Inquiry.
Senator Foraker, it is understood,
has decided to offer in the senate early
this week, a resolution of Inquiry into
the dismissal from the army of a bat
talion of the Twenty-fifth Infantry,
colored, as a result of the "shooting up"
of Brownsville, Texas, on the night of
August 13 last. The senator's resolu
tion will require the president or the
war department to furnish the senate
with all the facts in the case, including
especially the evidence upon which the
order of dismissal was based.
The purpose of asking for the data
Is to permit a clear judgment whether
an injustice has been done any of the
members of the disgraced organiza
tion. The question has been raised
whether the dismissal "without honor,"
which the colored infantrymen suffer
ed, does not deprive them illegally of
military right, such as pensions, ad
mission to soldiers' homes, etc.
The question of spelling undoubtedly
will receive attention at the hands of
congress this week. The subcommittee
of the house committee on appropria
tions which prepared the legislative,
executive and judicial appropriation
bill will report that measure to the full
committee today with the old form of
spelling retained, and it will be for the
committee to decide whether the sim
plified spelling method shall be used.
There is a possibility that the congres
sional record will contain both styles of
spelling. Representative Charles Lan
dis, chairman of the house committee
on printing, in discussing the question,
aid:
"The congressional record will con
tinue to be printed as heretofore. I
mean that the simplified spelling rules
wiii not apply to the record. Of course,
in reprinting the president's message
in the record the simplified spelling
forms that appear in that document
ill be reproduced but otnerwise the
record will continue to be the same old
fashioned fireside companion as of
yore." '
The friends of the ship subsidy bill
are Insistent that that measure receive
consideration at this session. Tne bill
Is still In committee in the house, but
its friends think they will be able to
get it out in due season and have it
considered.
Speaker Cannon and many other
prominent members of the house arriv
ed at the capitol lcng before the opening
of the house and engaged in a reunion
find informal discussion of probable is
sues which will occupy their attention.
Japanese Question Discussed.
The Japanese situation was discussed
quite generally by the members and
the opinion was expressed freely that
measures affecting the Japanese may
be introduced In the house at any time
Representative Needham, of Califor
nia, was the first member of the delega
tion from that state" to reach the capi
tol. Mr. Needham is not from the San i
Francisco district and consequently is
not in close touch with the situation in
that city arising from the exclusion of
tee Japanese from the public schools
attended oy white children. He sail,
Yiowever, that he believes the present
agitation will gradually die out and the
situation will quietly settle itself.
Representative Konn Cal.) suid he
doeg not think the California delega
tion will take immediate steps to
push any legislation affecting Japanese.
He said that the California delegation
probably will hold a meeting within two
weeks for the discussion of the ques
tion and doubtless will act as a unit in
rase a decision is reached to urge the
pflssage of any special measure. Two
IJanese exclusion billp, or.e by Repre
sentative McXinley (Cal.) and the oth
er by Representative Hayes (Cal.) are
now pending in congress.
IX THi: SENATE.
Both Piatt and Depew of New York
Appear in Their Places.
Washington, Dec. 3. Three raps
with the traditional little ivory gavel
in tho hand of Vice President Fair
banks brought sudden stillness over
the thronged galleries surrounding the
.senato chamber and ushered in the
first minute of the senate's last session
of the Fifty-ninth congress at noon to
day. Senator Teller of Colorado, was the
first to take his seat a full half hour
before the gavel fell. The venerable
Senator Piatt of New York, came in
leaning heavily on the arm of an at
tendant. Senator Daniel of Virginia
came next; then Senator Benson ol
Kansas. Senator Depew of New York,
took his place early in the row with
hi3 colleague.
One of the familiar faces most miss
ed was that of Senator Allison. He has
been detained In hin home at Du
buque, la., until after tho holiday re
cess. Most of the prominent Democrats
were in attendance, one exception be
ing Senator Bailey, who left Washing
ton a few days ago for his home in
Texas.
For fifteen minutes before noon
there was a general reception on the
floor with greetings and congratula
tions. When tho final signal for the
session was given the usual routine
of organization was begun. The oath
of office was taken today by Senator
Dupont of Delaware. After the intro
duction of a resolution regarding the
aisenargea negro troops, nominations
from the White House were received
after which the senato went into exe
cutive session.
At 12:44 p. m. tho senate adjourned
until tomorrow.
Xew Cabinet Name;? Sent In.
Washington, Dec. 3. The president
today sent the following nominations
to the senate:
Secretary of the treasury George
B. Cortelyou.

PROBING LAND FRAUDS.
U. S. Commissioner E. E. Clarke Begins
Investigation at Pueblo.
Pueblo, Colo., Dec. 3. United States
Commissioner E. E. Clarke, assisted by
Attorneys Thomas and Marchand, this
morning began an investiagtion of "al
leged land frauds and the relations be
tween -common carriers to the produc
tion of coal and oil and the transporta
tion of the same."
This was the way the commissioner
explained his visit to Pueblo. It is un
derstood that a large number of wit
nesses will be examined today In con
nection with the coal land holdings of i
the Colorado Fuel & Iron company, the I
Denver & Rio Grande, the Colorado & !
Southern a.id Santa Fe railroads for j
luc ul bcuui nig uixia. which
will be submitted to congress for defi
nite action. Should the investigation
bring out fact to warrant it, however,
the matter wil be brought to the atten
tion of a special United States grand
jury called for the purpose of indicting
those against whom charges may be
preferred. The hearing in this city was
held owing to the fact that it is the dls
Iributing center for the vast coal fields
at Canon City, Trinidad, Walsenburg
and the entire southern portion of
Colorado, and the commissioner expects
to gather some valuable information.
Within the past few weeks the gen
eral land office at Washington has
caused to be withdrawn from entry
more than a million and a half acres of
land said to contain coal in the Pueblo
district "to prevent monopolization of
the coal industries of the country by
railroads and other corporations.
Rate discrimination In other lines of
business may also be locked into.
At the conclusion of the hearing here
the commissioner will go to Denver to
continue his investigations along simi
lar lines.
THE SECOND OFFENSE.
Twenty-fifth Infantry Shot Up a Town
licforo Brownsville.
Washington, Dec. 3. The war de
partment is preparing for an investi
gation by congress of the case of the
companies of the Twenty-fifth infan
try recently discharged without honor
by order of President Roosevelt and
to this end had compiled a record of
negro troops dating back to the civil
war. It ir. said that this record dis
closes a state of affairs not generally
known and that once before at least
the Twenty-fifth infantry "shot up a
town."
The affair happened in 1885 at Ft.
Sturgi?, Dakota. Some of the negro
soldiers went on a rampage similar to
that at Brownsville, Tex., and one of
their number killed a citizen. In that
case, however, the citizens took the
matter into their own hands, forced
the troopers under pain of death to
disclose the name of the man who did
the killing and then took him cut and
lynched him.

CIIANGETHE LAW
Edison Company Will Ask City
for .ew Franchise.
L. E. Myers Is Here to Talk to
Council.
ASK MANY CONCESSIONS
Myers Says Present Franchise
Is Hostile to Company.
Offers to Pay $8,000 Toward
Cost of Viaduct.
Will City Accept the Price the
Company Proposes?
The Topeka Edison company wil".
ask for a new franchise from the city
council this evening.
In return for assuming two-thirds of
the cost of rebuilding the East Sixth
avenue viaduct the Missouri Pacific,
Santa Fe railroad and the Topeka
street railway join in demanding that
the franchise of the Topeka Edison
company be drafted anew and several
j objectionable features eliminated.
Two-thirds of the cost of the recon
struction of the viaduct would amount
according to the engineer's estimate at
$8,000. The estimate, less the sale of
iron and other salvage, is given as
$11,862.86. This would entirely re
construct the viaduct, put In new floor
ing and provide for repainting the
whole.
The interest that the two railroads
have in the grant of a new franchise
to the Topeka Edison company is in or
der that the street railway company,
which is practically identical in its in
terests with the Edison company, may
be enabled to change the routing of
its cars to Oakland over the viaduct
instead of under the railroad bridge
over the Kansas river, so that this land
intervening between the river bank and
the present railroad yards may be used
for an extension of the yards. ;
In addition the railroads ask that the
citv affirm anew to them under a con
tract that hereafter no attempt will be
made to make them pay for repairs to
the viaduct. Under the first construc
tion of the viaduct such an agreement
was entered into by the city and the
Missouri Pacific and the Santa Fe. This
agreement is what has kept the city
f rom securing the railroad's proportion
of the cost of maintenance of the struc
ture. The members of the council and the
mavor were unable to secure any prom
ise of aid from the two railroads and as
a resort the mayor called in L. E.
Myers of the Topeka Edison company
and the street railway company to ad
as diplomatic agent.
Mr. Myers has had several confer
ences with J. E. Hurley, general man
ager of the Santa Fe, who is acting in
the present instance for both the
Missouri Pacific and the Santa Fe. 'the
conference first held was unsatisfac
tory but continual hammering away
has brought some order out of the
chaos.
The Topeka Edison company had
some favors it wished to ask from the
council, it was in a position to grant
some to the railroads in addition to
occupying the same ground with rela
tion to the city council. Therefore all
three made common cause.
Some "Unofficial" Council Business.
Two informal sessions of the coun
cil have been held. One was held
Wednesday evening and another on
the following Thursday. At these two
sessions members of the council were
made acquainted with the terms on
which the railroads and the street rail
way company would assume a portion
of the cost of the reconstruction of the
viaduct.
The terms called for a number of
amendments to the Topeka Edison
franchise. It will practically bt re
vamped anew.
The council is at loggerheads over
the suggestion of a change in the
franchise it doesn't know what it will
do.
At this evening s session of thi
council L. E. Myers will make the of
fer of the railroads and will st.ato thv!
changes and amendments which lit'
wishes embodied in 'he franchise.
"I want the unfriendly tone of th?
franchise changed," Is the general ex
planation of the dissatisfaction whic2
Mr. Myers expresses for the franchise.
"The franchise, you will remember,
was granted when things were at a
fever heat. There was considerable
feeling existing at the time and f.
crept into the language of the fran
chise. "We can't exist and do business un
der the franchise as it now is worded.
It you happen to stub your toe any
where in it you fall down. When we
take this franchise and try to borrow
money on our plant they shake their
heuds and say, 'No, sir. Goodby.'
"There are a whole lot of little things
which don't amount to much but which
indicate hostility and it is this that we
want eliminated. For instance in the
conditions surrounding forfeiture of the
franchise it provides that if we violate
any of the provisions the rights and
privileges of this franchise it shall ipso
facto cease. Now it is just a little thing
like that word 'ipso facto' that we are
objecting to. We want to be given a
reasonable notice of the violation and
have time to comply."
Want to Make Secret Rates.
Important changes which are asked
follow:
That special rates may be made to
large consumers according to the
amount of electricity consumed and
that the rates be not published.
The section i elating to the Wright
maximum demand system of charging
be eliminated entirely.
That the section which provides that
the franchise may not be an exclusive
grant be stricken out because the city
charter act already provides for this
feature.
That tho section relating to meter in
spection be amended to provide that
due notice of when an inspection is to
be made by a city inspector should be
given to the company in order that the
Edison company may have a represen
tative present.
The section covering the right of the
city to demand cables and wires be
placed undei ground is to suffer amend
ment but to what extent there is a re
luctance to state.
In return for these changes the To
peka Edison company is to offer a re
duction of rates amounting to 25 per
cent of the maximum specified In the
franchise. The reduction is now in ef
fect. The reduction would represent
the following for residence lighting,
from 12 cenis to 10 cents; commercial
lighting from 10 cents to 8 cents. For
power from 6 cents to 5 cents. The
rates for steam heating purposes re
main the same. The assumption of
two-thirds of the cost of the viaduct.
Extension of the street railway to
Shorey postoffiee and the construction
of a double track of the street railway
the entire distance cut West Tenth av&
nue.
If the council refuses to make the de
sired changes, the company says none
of tne above improvements will be
made. By the Edison company, the
whole franchise is termed unreasonable.
The new franchise of the Topeka Edi
son company went into effect July 19,
1905. after a fight in the council, which
extended outside among the business
men and which lasted over six months.
Finally after fighting practically all
of the concessions asked for by the bus
iness men and consumers who believed
they had a grievance, many points
were conceded and the franchise draft
ed. "I don't want to open up a quarrel
again," said Mr. Myers today. "If it is
going to lead to that 1 swear I will
never spend another cent in Topeka.
We have done a lot for this town. We
have given whenever we were asked to
give, and liberally too. But it has al
ways been give, give and nothing back
until we are getting a little tired.
"There are some things in this fran
chise, too, which we can't live up to and
we won't. So that's all there is to it.
The city can't force us either and make
us go bankrupt. We can't do business
unless we can discriminate as to vary
ing service to different consumers. It
isn't right to force us not to. Here is a
man who comes to us from 7 o'clock to
5 o'clock in the day time and wants
current. We give it to him at., say 5
cents. Here is another party who
wants to use from dusk until 9 o'clock,
just at the time when-the load is heavi
est. We would rather have the first
man when the load is lightest at 5 cents
than this other chap who comes in when
the load is heaviest at 5 cents or even
6 cents.
"I don't think that It is unfair of us
to ask that we be allowed a repre
sentative to be present when the city
makes its inspection of meters. Do
you ? We ask for reasonable notice In
advance and that's all.
"We will waive the Wright maxi
mum demand system of charging. In
fact we are waiving it now. The peo
ple didn't want -it themselves after
they, found out what it was. There
was a howl came up when it first was
put in at the increase In the bills.
"We are not particular about tak
ing this section out but it is only on
what may bo asked from us.
"We are willing to make the annual
report to the city. ; In fact there isn't
much change to the franchise. There
i3 a tone throughout the entire fran
chise though that we don't like and we
ask that the wording be changed.
"Natural gas has cut heavily into
our business here and we are contin
ually putting money .into our plant
here and taking nothing out We
have to borrow money and when we
spread out this franchise before them
on which to borroy money they com
pare it with the former franchise, -notice
its terms and remark that there
must be- considerable -bitter feeling
stirred -tip here. We tell them no. But
they show us our franchise and com
pare it unfavorably with the old and
they say there must be some and tell
us they don't believe they care to in.
vest."
"I don't know what will' be done."
said the mayor. "It will be presented
to the council this evening and I don't
know what the council may think
about it. I haven't got anything to
say about it personally."
F0UHDAGA1HSTM00RE.
Reported That Tills Is the Result of
tlio O. A. It. Court Martial.
It is understood that the G. A. R.
court martial, which has concluded its
trial of Ed. G. Moore, the proprietor
of a printing house here and a mem
ber of the Lincoln Post G. A. R.. has
found that he should be dropped from
the rolln of G. A. R. organization of
Kansas, and has so reported to P. H.
Coney, the commander in chief of the
organization, who will review and pro
mulgate an order within the next few
days setting forth the findings of the
court.
This is the first court martial of this
sort which han been held during the
history of the G. A. R. organization in
Kansas and it has been hedged around
with all sorts of secrecy. None of the
parties interested in it will discuss it in
any way and insist that nothing about
it will be made public until Comman
der Coney makes known the findings
of the court in an official way.
Moore was tried on several charges
and it is reported that he was found
guilty on all of them. Among the
charges was one which accused him
of writing a letter to Mr. Coney in
which he called tho latter names
which are not even permitted to go
through the mails.

Gillette Cr.se Will Re Decided Within
a Few Hours.
Herkimer. N. Y.. Dec. 3. Chester
E. Gillette, the young factory foreman
of Cortland, on trial here for the al
leged murder of Grace Brown, his
sweetheart, probably will know his
fate within the next 24 hours. Dis
trict Attorney Ward will sum up for
ths state today, taking the ground
that Gillette deliberately planned to
murder Miss Brown and did kill her or
render her insensible with blows on
the head with a tennis racquet, her
body being then thrown into Big
Moose lake in the Adirondacks. Coun
sel for Gillette will urge the theory of
suicide.

EE TIIEL1 MARCH
Elks Minstrels Parade on iiansas
Avenue at Jioon.
The Big Minstrel Show
Grand Tonight.
at
PROGRAMME IN FULL.
Dick Cooley Will Be One of the
Stars of the Show.
List of the Elks Who Are Mixed
Up in the Tragedy.
The Elks Minstrel parade at noon
today proved to be a creditable exhibi
tion. Fifty men in neat uniforms, ac
companied by Marshall's band parad
ed up Kansas avenue and down Jack
son street, preliminary to the grand
performances at the New Grand op
era house tonight.
With the exception of the overture,
the finale, and one or two features of
tonight's program there will be an en
tire change tomorrow night.
This fact can not be too strongly
stated. Many have gained the impres
sion that the show Tuesday night will
be identical with the show tonight.
This is not the case. Practically every
joke used tonight will give way for
otners tomorrow night, and new songs
and feature acts will also take the
boards tomorrow night.
Nearly every one in Topeka who
knows "Dick" Cooley personally, has
heard him sing "Robinson Cruso" to
his own piano accompaniment. Every
one who has heard him sing that song
once will liBten to him as many times
again as the opportunity presents it-
seir.
"Robinson Cruso" was one of the
songs Cooley used while he was in
vaudeville, and it's a "scream." No one
sings Cooley's songs just like he does,
and they have to be heard to be ap
preciated. In addition to "Robinson Cruso"
Mr. Cooley will also sing "Under My
Blanket in My Foldin' Bed," and
"Possum Pie," both hits.
The following is the complete pro
gramme for the entertainment, those
numbers which do not appear tonight
will appear Tuesday night, and vice
versa :

MUD IS DRYING UP FAST.
Balmy Weather and Light Winds Make
December Beautiful.
The weather today has been all that
could be desired at this time of year.
The sun came out early this morning
and the mud which has been a nui
sance to the community for several
days is drying up as a result. For the
first time in several days the thermome
ter has reached the 50 mark and at 2
o'clock this afternoon the mercury had
reached 52 degrees.
The same weather will prevail to
morrow and it will perhaps be a little
warmer than today. The wind today
is blowing three miles an hour from
the northeast which in Kansas is just
as good as no wind.

TO OPEN PORT ARTHUR
Government Will Take Over the Canal
and Harbor.
Washington, Dec. 3. The government
will take over the deep water" canal and
harbor at Port Arthur next Wednes
day. Attorney S. W. Moore, of Kan
sas City, representing the Port Arthur
Canal and Dock company, present own
er of the canal and harbor, delivered
deeds to the property to the secretary
of war today. They were immediately
referred to the legal department, and
as soon as the titles are passed upon the
transfer will be made.
The department informed Mr. Moore
that the deal could be closed by Wed
nesday. As soon as it is made Port
Arthur will be made a port of entry.
The Port Arthur canal is nine miles
long and 25 feet deep. It was dug by
A. E. Stilwell In 1899 to connect his
railroad, now the Kansas City South
ern, with deep water. At the last ses
sion of congress the canal company,
an off-shoot of the railway company.of
fered to transfer the canal and harbor
to the government, providing it would
improve and maintain it. Congress
passed a bill authorizing the deal, the
old canal company assuming the JS00,
000 indebtedness.
In addition to the canal and harbor,
the deed transfers a strip of land 125
feet wide on the west side of the canal
its entire length to enable the govern
ment to widen the ditch when business
justifies it. The company will retain
ownership of the docks and wharf.
The transfer of the canal and harbor
to the government will make it easier
for Kansas City grain and lumber dea
lers to handle export trade. Ships will
be cleared at Port Arthur. At present
Galveston is the nearest port of entry.
The opening of a port on Sabine bay
will encourage export trade in the cen
tral west. Already another big steam
ship company is figuring on putting on a
line of boats from Port Arthur to Eur
ope, while still another company pro
poses to establish a freight and passen
ger line to New York.
About $15,000,000 worth of traffic u
handled through the canal last year and
officials say that this amount will be
doubled the first year after the gov
ernment gets hold of the canal and
establishes a port of entry.

TO GIVEJJP IMl
Volira Announces That City Will
Jte Abandoned.
He Will Become the Moses of the
Dowie Sect.
WILL FOUND NEW CITY
To Be Conducted Along Social
istic Lines.
He Assumes "Ditine Authority'
0?er the Whole Affair.
Chicago, Dec. 3. The Chronicle to
day says:
Zion City is to be abandoned. The
"restoration host" which was built up
by John Alexander Dowie after years
of strenuous effort will shortly be left
to its creditors by Overseer Wilbur
Glenn Voliva, who like a new Moses,
will lead his people forth from the dis
credited gates to found another Zion.
Announcement of the approaching
heglra was made yesterday by Over
seer Voliva before an audience of more
than 1,000 persons in the Zion church
at Sixteenth street and Michigan ave
nue. It was marked by his assump
tion of "Divine authority" at the same
time he outlined his plans for a new
city, to be conducted along socialistic
lines, with himself as supreme spiritual'
and temporal head. Autocratic social
ism is to be the government of the new
community. As to the location of the
new Zion Voliva was silent.
WASTING TIME.
Testing Right or Frisco to Exclude
Japanese From the Schools.
San Francisco, Dee. 3. The Call says
today:
School Director D. H. Oliver stated
yesterday that Secretary Metcalf before
his departure for Washington told the
school director that he believed that
they were clearly within their rights In
establishing a separate school for Jap
anese pupils. This would tend to cor
rect the impression that Secretary Met
calf had decided to favor the Japanese
in his report to the president. The
secretary's report, it may be assumed,
will conform to his assurances to the
school board.
Attorneys versed in International
law believe that the treaty between
Japan and America In no way covers
the points at issue and the best that
the United States can do for the island
empire is to institute a test cape in the
federal .courts as has already been
done.
That the matter will be taken to the
supreme court for final decision is now
quite evident and if it is decided there
that Japanese are not Mongolians, a
contention that has been made to divert
the enforcement of the law requiring
that race to be kept in school separate
from white children, it is quite certain
that the state legislature at its next ses
sion will pass a new law to keep the
Japanese out of the schools in which
Caucasians are taught.
In an interview yesterday Dr. Walsh
expressed sentiments similar to those
of Mr. Oliver. ,
