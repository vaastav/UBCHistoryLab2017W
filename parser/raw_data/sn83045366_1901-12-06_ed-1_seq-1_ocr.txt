EXTRAVAGANCE IN PHILIPPINES
Salaries of Civilians Pronounced

From Th» Journal Bureau, Room 45, Port
Jiuililinsj. Washinyton.
Washington, Dec. «.—lt is said that
President Roosevelt's original intention
■was to deal with trusts much more vls
orously than he did, but that he finally
yielded to the Judgment of his associates,
who told him that as president, in a
formal message to congress, he would not
be as free from restraint as he would be
in writing a magazine article or in a
book. His official utterances are the ut
terances of a great political party, and the
voice of the nation; as an author his ut
terances are bis own and nobody else ;s
involved in them. He saw the point, and
finally consented to exercise due discretion
and tact. His efforts in that direction
are shown in the trust section of the
message.
His personal views, however, are said
to be of a very positive character. He
originally intended to go at the trusts
slam bang, denouncing them in strong
language and urging on congress the ne
cessity of dealing with them promptly.
This feature of the message was softened.
But the president is not a friend to ths
trusts, nor will he permit them to en
croach upon the people's rights if he can
prevent. At the same time, he will pro
ceed carefully, as was stated the other
day in these dispatches, when his attitude
toward the Northern Securities company
was outlined. Both the trusts and the
people have rights, and it will be his pur
posi- to see that neither side infringes
upon the rights of the other.

Charged With Many Murders
Rock Island, 111., Dec. 6.—A human skeleton thought to be that of Fred Krein
zen, who mysteriously disappeared seven years ago, has Just been unearthed on
the farm near Milan, formerly occupied by Henry Bastian, who, in 1896, ended his
life by hanging himself on the eve of arrest. Bastian was prominent in church and
social circles, but led a dual life. It is charged that he would refuse to pay his
farm hands, and when they became insistent, he would knock them on the head
and roakti way with the bodies.
Eight young men who had worked for him In the ten years previous to his sui
cide, ii is asserted, met mysterious deaths. Their names were Fred Kuschman,
John Lauderbach, Hugh McOafferty, Marshall Lewis, Axel Sternberg, Ernest Miller,
August Johnson and Kreinzen.
LARGER FORT
Request as to Snelling That
May Be Complied

From The Journal Bureau, Jtootn AS, Pott
Building, TFashini/ton. ,
Washington, Dec. 6.—Senator Clapp and
Representatives Fletcher and Stevens had
a conference with Secretary Root to-day
regarding the proposed enlargement of
Fort Snelling. For the present they have
abandoned the idea of trying to have
Snelling selected as one of the four large
army posts where field maneuvers are to
take place annually. This will be con
sidered later. ;.••:
To-day the delegation asked Secretary
Root to enlarge Snelling to about five
times its present size, involving the ex
penditure of a million dollars, and to be
made available for the use of all branches
of the service. The secretary listened at
tentively. It had been the intention of the j
delegation not to see the secretary until '■
to-morrow, when memorials from the twin |
cities' commercial and other clubs will ar
rive, but investigation showed that to
day was the last day for^the presentation
1 of memorials, and so the delegation had
jto got busy. Next week the army board
i will start on its tour of inspection. Rep
j resentative Stevens tells The Jour
nal that he is very hopeful that the re
! quest made for Snelling to-day will be
j granted. —W. W. Jermane.

New Orleans, Dec. 6.—The fight against
the cottonseed oil trust is growing warm

grand Jury at Jackson indicted a number
of managers of oil mills for violating the
anti-trust laws by combining to fix the
price of cotton seed. The United States
grand jury at Oxford summoned a number :
of mill managers to testify before it. i
They refused to answer certain questions,
j but United States District Judge Niles
j held the interrogatories proper and or

The first manager, Mr. Foot, of the Can
ton mill, still refused to answer. There- !
upon Judge Niles sent him to jail for
contempt of court. The other managers
of mills have declared their purpose to
refuse to answer the questions propound

AFTER MOOSE
President Will Visit Minne
sota if Canada Game Will,
Come to Him.
Washington, Dec. 6.—President Roose
velt has bene invited by Representative
Eddy of Minnesota to acompany him on
a moose hunt during the Christmas holi
days. Mr. Eddy told the president that
moose could be found in large numbers
just beyond the Minnesota border in
Canada and that better sport could not
be found anywhere. He offered to have a
special train placed at the disposal of the
president so as to take the latter within
a few miles of the feeding grounds of
this large game.
President Roosevelt told the Minnesota
man he would be delighted to accept the
invitation If It were not for the fact that
there was an unwritten law against the
president going beyond the borders of tha
United States. The president said he
would be pleased to participate In tho
hunt If Mr. Eddy could induce the moose
to come over on American territory.

London, Dec. 6.—A convict at the Pen
tonvllle prison, who managed to elude
the wardens, has established himself on
the roof of the institution and for the last
thirty hours has defied all attempts to
dislodge him. Thousands of spectators are
watching the show and aiding the pris
oner by timely warnings of the move
ments o* his would-be captors. Ladders
placed against" the wall are promptly
thrown down by the occupant of the roof,
whose reckless movements and wild
laughter at the futile efforts of the war
dens are thought to indicate insanity. The
fugitive has collected a large pile of
slates which he gleefully throws at the
heads of the officials who attempt to scale
the wall by means of ladders until they
are forced to retreat.
The convict was eventually starved into
submission. He surrendered this after
noon after defeating all attempts to dis
lodge him by force. He was finally lured
to the ground by the offer of a dish of
roast beef and potatoes.

against any future rising of the Dutch

therefore there is nothing left but to rely

CLASSED AS
A MYSTERY
Puzzling Features in Pickett
Murder Case.
THE DEFENSE BEGINS
Testimony Introduced Tending to
Impeach State's Main Points.
CORONER SAYS LAMP WAS BROKEN
The State Hat Introduced One in
Evidence That 1m Wholly
Uninjured.
"This Pickett case is one of the great
eat mysteries I have ever heard of," said
an eminent jurist this morning in discus
sing the case now on trial before Judge
Elliott. "It is more mysterious than the
famous Hayward case which attracted the
attention of the whole country, and the
equally famous Hamilton case is sim
plicity itself compared to it. Take the
case from any view-point and try to ar
rive at some reasonable conclusion and
one is met with most mystifying condi
tions. The more evidence you hear, the
deeper becomes the puzzle. A thousand
questions present themselves almost im
mediately when one attempts to unravel
the case."
While a great many persons, some of
them able lawyers, experienced in court
proceedings, have attempted 10 follow the
case, they have not been able to arrive at
any conclusion. It baffles all theories and
all speculation.
There are many expressions of opinion
as to Pickett's guilt or inocence, but none
is- based on evidence. Those who abide
by the old English rule that a person is
innocent until proved guilty say that the
prisoner is not guilty. While others con
tend that Pickett's actions and the many
suspicious incidents almost establish a
complete circumstantial case against
Piekett.
While the crowd In attendance is not
large as compared with the throngs which
clamored for admission to the Hayward
and Hamilton trials, the individuals follow
the case as closely as either of the other
famous causes were watched.
Piekett and his family are noticeably
more at ease to-day. Some of the
damaging testimony adduced during the
first two days of the trial has been im
peached and partially controverted and
the gloom which settled over the family
is clearing away as the case for the de
fense grows stronger and stronger.
The late Mrs. Pickett's sister continues
to groan and sigh and sobs hysterically at
all reference to her sister, whom she firm
ly believes was murdered.
Mrs. Wjils.l. Heard Xo Scuffling:.
Mrs. Katie Walsh was the last person
who saw Mrs. Augusta Pickett alive and
there was much interest In her evidence
when she took the stand this morning in
the Pickett murder trial.
Mrs. Walsh met Mrs. Pickett on the
back porch about 9:30 in the evening.
Mrs. Pickett had returned from a visit
to her friend Mrs. Carlin. She said that
the remainder of the family had retired.
Mrs. Pickett complained of being tired
and said that she would retire herself.
Having lived at the flat building for
several years, Mrs. Walsh was well ac
quainted with the Picketts. They were on
excellent terms; Mr. Pickett was a good
husband and an affectionate father.
Mrs. Walsh's attention -was called to a
conversation between herself and her
neighbors while they were gathered in the
house across the way after the fire. She
denied having made statements attributed
to her by the other ladies regarding the
noise which awoke her.
"Will you say that you did not state on ;
that night that you were awakened by a |
strange noise, a sound of scuffling and
other disturbances?" asked Mr. Boarcf
man.
"I heard no sound of scuffling," replied
Mrs. Walsh.
"Will you say that you did not say to
the others that you heard the noise of
scuffling?"
"Yes, I will. I heard a noise, but it
was not scuffling."
"Describe the noise you heard."
"It was like the roaring of a fire. I
awoke and rushing into our bathroom saw
a glare from the Pickett bathroom."
Mrs. Walsh had then aroused her hus
band and they dressed and left the build
ing.
Shortly after on returning to the build
ing she heard Pickett say that he had
tried to save his wife. The flesh of her
foot had come off in his hands and he had
to run to save himself and the children.
The next morning Pickett told of being
awakened by what he thought was a call
of "Reuben! Help!"
Later she heard Mr. Pickett say:
"When I saw what I had done I turned
around," but-she did not know in what
connection these words were said.
She admitted that she had conceived
that Pickett knew more of the fire than
he cared to tell. Thia impression still
remained with her from time to time.

ME JURY IN THE PICKETT CASE
20 PAGES-FIVE O'CLOCK.
FATHER OF WATERS
TIRED OF HIS JOB
Millers and Street Railway Officials
Wondering if the Mississippi
Is Running Dry.
Mills Use Steam, Street Car Power
Insufficient—Low Stage Unprec
edented at This Season.
Is the Mississippi river running dry?
That is the question of "great pith and
moment" which the chief representatives
of the vast interests depending wholly or
in part upon the water power to drive the
wheels of giant industries at Minneapolis
have been anxiously asking each other
during the last week.
While the sources of the Mississippi may
be in no danger of early exhaustion, the
extraordinary low stage of water in the
river at this season has caused serious
inconvenience to the milling companies
whose immense plants cluster about the
falls, and to the street railway system,
which for several years past has been de
pending wholly upon the power generated
below the falls to run the street cars of
the two cities.
Already the large milling companies
have been forced to employ auxiliary
steam plants in five large mills at the
asop 0} jo jBaX am jo uost;as
down. This emergency developed Wednes
day. To-day the Twin City Rapid Transit
company authorizes the statement that
the water has reached such a low stage
at the lower dam that power is insufficient
to propel the cars in Minneapolis and St.
Paul and on the suburban lines. The
street railway company has been forced to
go back to the partially dismantled steam,
power houses which generated power in
the old days, which are now unable to
generate all the powed needed. The re
sulting loss to the street railway company
and the mills will be heavy.
Ice or Logging Dams?
Several reasons have been advanced to
explain the remarkable shrinkage in the
river. The officials of the milling com-
panics %ay it may be due to a congestion
of anchor ice up stream. Cold weather,
they argue, would close the surface of the
river and insure a steady stream. An
other reason, which may be a partial ex
planation of the shrinkage so far as the
mills are concerned, is that the Pillsbury
"A" mill, which has been undergoing al
terations and repairs since July 14,
started up Monday. A large quantity of
water would thus have been diverted
from the use of the other mills.
With orders waiting and the mills run
ning to their full capacity, the notice re
ceived by the mills from the power com
pany to shut off a part of their turbines
created a great big stir in the milling
district Tuesday. The order went into
effect early Wednesday morning, when the
Pillsbury-Waahburn company stopped
using water at its "B" mill, the Wash
burn-Crosby company at its "C" and Min
neapolis mills; the Consolidated company
at its Excelsior and Columbia mills.
By all odda the most serious feature of
the situation is its effect on the transpor
tation facilities of Minneapolis and St.
Paul. The explanations of the shortage
of water, given by the milling officials,
will hardly apply to the street railway
company. Conditions imposed by the
mills themselves and affecting simply the
head of water at the ialls would hardly
have the same effect below the apron.
The street railway officials, while at a loss
for any certain explanation of the slug
gish flow of water, believe that lumber
ing operations in the north, where tribu
tary streams are dammed up for logging
purposes, may diminish the volume of
water to a considerable extent.
Street Cars Hard Hit.
Within the last few days the Twin City
Rapid Transit company has been brought
face to face with a condition so serious in
its curtailment of the power supply fur
nished by the St. Anthony Falls Water
Power company as materially to handicap
,the company in the operation of its cars
throughout its system in Minneapolis and
St. Paul.
For the first time in many years—per
haps in the history of the city—the stage
of water in the river has diminished to
such an extent as to furnish very little
water power comr ed to that which re
sults from the ordinary flow.
Since the utilization of the immense
water power below the Falls of St. An
thony first became an accomplished fact,
the street railway company has extended
its capacity for handling cars over great
distances, far beyond that which could
obtain by the use of ordinary power
houses. Now that the water power is be
ing interfered with, however, temporarily,
it may be, the company finds itself unable
to generate sufficient power, by bringing
every possible expedient to bear, to run
the cars on a schedule evenly approxi
mating that obtained before quicker serv-
Ice was Installed. The result is that at
the very time the public is demanding
more rapid transit, the company finds it
self suddenly forced to resort to a re
duced schedule greater than has been in
effect for years.
In addition to the great inconvenience
to which the public will be subjected, the
low stage of water will be so serious,
from a financial standpoint, as to cost
the strete railway company thousands ot
dollars.
Enongh Power in the Future.
To guard against any such possible fu
ture emergency, the street railway com
pany has already had a consultation of
engineers. The situation has been thor
oughly gone over and a plan agreed upon
which will prevent the slightest inter
ference with street railway traffic here
after, no matter what the stage of water
in the river may be.
Vice President C. G. Goodrich this
morning outlined the unfortunate position
in which the company finds itself at the
very moment it was making strenuous
efforts to satisfy the public demand for
increased service. Said he:
The Mississippi river appears to be run
ing dry. It should not be inferred from this
that, we are experiencing any permanent
slump In the supply of water, but It is great
enough, however temporary it may be. to
materially reduce the power at the dam.
Without going into any figures, it is sufficient
to say that the low water has cut into the
generating capacity of the power house at the
dam to such an extent as greatly to diminish,
the power and force upon us the unpleasant
alternative ot reducing the service on all lines
in Minneapolis and St. Paul.
I cannot remember when the river has been,
so low before at this time of the year. The
present stage is so entirely without precedent
that we have never even felt the nces3ity of
taking that item into consideration when the
utilization of the power dam was first en
tertained. We had very little rain last fall,
and that may account to a considerable ex
tent, for the present lack of water. Engineer
De la Barre has advanced another reason. He
says that lumbering operations on the upper
Mississippi river and in the reservoir region
may have materially affected the water sup
ply. It is the practice among the lumbermen
to dam up all the logging streams tributary
to the Mississippi in order to get a sufficient
head of water to facilitate logging operations
in the spring. As booh as the water fills up
the reservoirs thus created, it will begin to
flow over the dams. The water in the river
will then be restored to its ordinary level
and the difficulty with which we are now
contending, will then have, been oven ome.
If this is the true explanation, the short
age in the water supply should be v matter
of but a few clays. In the absence of a more
pluu3ible explanation of the drop in the river
It would be folly to say that the present lack
of power will continue but a few days. Per
haps it will, but It may be that we will be
force£ to do the best we can with steam
power houses, combined with what power
is still still generated below the falls, tor a
week or more to come.
In the mean time I have thought bf>st to
acquaint the public with the unfortunate con
dition of affairs against which we flnd our
selves forced to contend, and to ask its in
dulgence in the slower car service which must
necessarily ensue until such time as tho
flood-gates, now closed against us, may bo
opened.
It should be understood that we will con
tinue to operate as many cars In both cit'ea
as we have been able to before installing the
new schedule within the last week. The
hardship lies in our inability, in face of this
nnforseen obstacle to our plans, to run the
same number of cars as often as_ the com
pany or the public desires.
