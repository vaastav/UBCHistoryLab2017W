EARLY SCHOOL LAWS OF NEW
MEXICO.
The latest quarterly bulletin of the
University of New Mexico Is devoted
to a review of the "Early School Laws
of New Mexico," and is of intense in
terest both sociologically and histori
cally, The compilation Is from the
pen of Professor C. E. Hodgin, B. Ph.
Among other matters, the pamphlet
gives the various memorial addresses
to Congress asking for financial aid
for the public schools. As late as
lSGIi, the Legislative Assembly in such
a memorial says: "There is not a
public school system in the Territory.
Out of a population of :i,516 there are
57,333 that cannot read or write." Yea,
even as late as 1899, the Legislative
Assembly found It necessary to pass
a law providing that teachers em
ployed In the public schools shall be
able to read and write either in Eng
lish or in Spanish. In 1S47, the Gov
ernor in his message to the Legisla
ture said: "There is at present but
one public school in the Territory,
that located In the city of Santa Fe,
and supported by funds of the county.
All children are free to attend this
school, but the funds of the county
are insufficient to employ more than
one teacher." From this humble be
ginning at Santa Fe, the present fine
public school system of the Territory
has grown and that without any help
from the federal government, which
was invoked repeatedly after New
Mexico became a part of the United
States. Says the writer: "When the
United States acquired New Mexico,
the people included in the Territory,
spoke only the Spanish, their native
language. It therefore seems that the
government of the United States di
rectly shouldered the responsibility
of providing means for the Instruction
of these people In the English lan
guage the language of the country
which they were forced to adopt. But
as a matter of fact, the national gov
ernment has done absolutely nothing
from that day unto this to assist the
Mexican people coming with the ac
quired territory to learn the English
language."
How necessary wast such holp Is
shown by a legislative memorial in
1853, which says: "The undeniable fact
is that in no part of the United States
are the means of education so defi
cient, 'as In New Mexico." The nex't
yenr the Legislative Assembly in an
o' r memorial told Congress that
seven-eighths of the population could
neither read nor write.
However, the people of the Terv
tory were not friendly toward a pub
lic school system.
"When the Territorial Legislature
made its first attempt at passing a
school law during the session of 1S55
56, the schools to be supported by tax
ation of the property of the citizens,
so bitter was the oposition from four
counties Taos, Rio Arriba, Santa
Ana and Socorro that they were
exempted from the operation of the
law, the citizens of those counties be
ing permitted to vote on the accept
ance or ejection of the law. The re
turns of the election showed that 5,
0,13 votes were cast in the four coun
ties, and that only 37 were in favor of
public schools a result truly disheart
ening to the leaders of the movement.
The law was operative in other parts
of the Territory, but within a year
(the Legislature then meeting annual
ly) the law was repealed, and all taxes
and fines collected under that law
were, by legislative act, returned to
the citizens paying same."
The first school law, that of 1855-50,
provided for compulsory education but
also prescribed that no school teacher
should receive a salary exceeding $40
a month. In addition, the four largest
and most populous counties of the
Territory were exempt from the oper
ations of its provisions. A later law
provided that teachers should be paid
fifty cents a month for each child en
rolled and that each child during the
winter, should bring a stick of wood
to school to keep the fire agoing.
How marvelous therefore the pro
gress since 1891, when the first ade
quate attempt was made to establish
a public school systenl with Hon.
Amado uhaves at its head as super
intendent. For six years he labored
to lay the foundations and that he
did his work well is evidenced by the
many public school buildings In the
Territory, the 50,000 children attend
ing the public schools, taught by more
than a thousand teachers and at an
expenditure of more than a quarter
million dollars annually.
MAXIMS OF POLITICAL ECONOMY
REVERSED.
Uncle S'am's domain is a great coun
try. The agricultural products in bis
dominions of the present year, both
in money value and in amount are
the greatest In the history of this
Nation. The figures are sim
ply astonishing and cannot be grasp
ed easily by the lay mM. It is all
very well to say that the value of the
agricultural products of tills country
for this year amounted to 0,794 mil
lions of dollars, but after this Is said,
what then? The sum is so stupen
dous tihat It fails to Impress the or
dinary mind with Its grandeur and
Infinity. There Is no humbug about
itbese figures, they are stern reality.
With all there is complaint and
charges that this- stupendous produc
tton acts Injuriously upon mil lions of
citizens while tt aids materially cer
tain trust Interests and' fills the cof
fers of these imulti-milllonnlires with
raster sums taken from what Is
at the Santa Fe Postofflce.

called the plain people. Commenting
upon this state of affairs, the Kansas
City Star editorially says that the
market value of the agrieuliural
products of tho United States for
the present, year, according to the
Secretary of Agriculture, is G.794 mil
lion dollars, a gain over last year
which held the record of 4S5 million
dollars. The increase in value is due
both t the enlarged volume anil the
.higher prices of products.
Sdiisfaclion 'in the gross value of
a country's products, whether raw
material or manufactured artiicles, is
always qualified by the eipill.y or in
equity with which the benefits are ills-
hribuleil. Secretary Wilson calls at
tention to the fact that inn Increase
of one-fcwth cent in the average price
of meat per pound means a cost of
nearly 42 milHon dollars in the year
to the people of this country. It is
,reiulily seen, therefore, what, profits
may be reached by the paekers, who
coii'trul and make meat prices almost
wholly wilh reference to their own
interests. Wilh the volume of neat
cattle greatly Increased as compared
with last year 'the average reliaH
pi'xes of all meals is the highest in
vears. In oilier words, excessive pro
duction Is accompanied by excessive
retail prices. The cat lie growers get
very M title benefits of ihp 'lens of
millions of additional 'dollars that the
consumers of memt pay. Il goes to
the greedy packing trust.
This Is only one illustration. There
are others that oonl.l be cited to
show that the ordinary effects of sup
ply and demand, over-produci'iOn and
under-production, no longer necessari
ly follow 1n expected sequence. The
markets are com rolled by individuals
and combinations of individuals, rath
er than by the volume of commodities.
At least arbitiary control is often
stronger than the natural Influences
of output. As a result" 'the people are
ever at the nieicy of the monopolists
of various kinds. M'nnoioly .does not
ne cessarily imply a formal organiza
tion or agreement. It is possible
and it is a fact of record that retail
dealers, In a given line, may vie with
one another in raising prices rather
than competing by lowering them.
There Is something wrong with the
retail business when, for instance, i
man can make a profit, of $25,1100 a
.year out of a meat shop. Such iprofils
within the scope of a small estab
lishment, would be impossible with
olid-fashioned competition.
A DEPARTURE FROM THE OLD IN
PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE.
That, the Roosevelt administration
marks the beginning of a new era, one
might almost, say, departure, in the
history of the Nation, Is obvious even
to 'those who are not close observers
of political events. A striking inns'
(ration of this Is found in the mes
sage sent to Congress yesterday by
tho Presid'en't. The President speaks
through it to Congress and to the
people as no President has spoken
before. He takes advantage to the
full of his constitutional prerogative
to advise Congress and his advice, If
not entirely upon new linos from the
policy established by the founders of
the Re-'publ'ie, is yet so different from
tho precedent set: by recent ailmlivM
trations as to be startling. There is
a robust self-assertion aibout the
President and out of it grows the
advancement of Individual Ideas with
out fear or favor of criticism. He be
lieves in certain policies and he advo
cates them as being the best, solution
for the problems' of today.
The President believes in a world
policy for the United States and de
precates 'that narrow provincialism,
that egotism which professes to de
spise other nations. His panegyric of
Japan and Its achievements, is not
pleasant reading to the survivors of
the A. P, A. movement, nor'to those
who believe in an Insular policy that
ignores the claims of other nations
when they conflict with self-interest.
The President advocates an exten
sion of the federal powers, judicial,
legislative and executive. This em
braces a certain form of paternalism
which embodies the best that there
is to be found in theoretic socialism.
He believes in .regulation by taw of
trusts, of railroads, of the. question of
marriage and divorce, going so far
as to advocate 'a con'stitutlona'l' amend
ment to give the federal government
the power to deal adequately with
these iproblems. He believes in na
tional legislation against child 'labor
and urges Immediate action to prohib
it it in the territories and the federal
district as being a step toward the
consummation of a federal laibor law.
He goes farther, and sanctions the
eight hour day for mechanics and the
Saturday half holiday for postofflce
and the few other federal em
ployes not yet enjoying it, but only
In the United States, not In the
Island and Isthmus possessions,
where he frankly declares, the en
forcement of an eight hour day and
the exclusion of coolie labor, would
be absurd and folly. While this em
hodlos a theoretical contradiction,
yet, It Is natural for a man who is
distinctly practical and' wants to
achieve things, and who will desert
theory when It stands In the way of
a great national achievement.
President Roosevelt forgets the Re
publican shibboleth of a protective
tariff so far as to advocate free trade
with the Philippines. This also is
characteristic of him, to place the ua-
tlon's duty toward the Filipinos above
self-Interest and party policy, It Is
certain that the President, a Republi
can heart and soul from principle, al
lows himself latitude enough to do his
own thinking and where his logic does
not agree with party logic, to express
himself frankly and to follow his own
Inclinations. This is the most mani
fest characteristic of all great men,
of all individualities that have left an
Impress upon the world. The man who
always swims with the current, who
bows at nil times to party policy and
pany dictates, has his uses of conser
vatism, but he will never be a Roose
velt. The President does not mention
statehood for New Mexico and Ari
zona In his message. Too trivial a
topic, perhaps, from his standpoint,
and a good omen, for he binds himself
to no opposition to the admission of
the territories and his pledge to" help
New Mexico to statehood still stands.
Ills recommendations as to the
Navy and Army will not be pleasing to
many of the older officers and also a
departure from tradition, but if there
is any problem upon which the Presi
dent has devoted much thought and
has ripe experience, it is that of the
Army and the Navy, and the nation
might as well follow his lead which
has for its object the strengthening of
the army and naval power be commen
surate with the country's importance
as a world power.
MUCH TO GAIN, NOTHING TO
LOSE.
The Texlco Democrat Is on
tho other side of 'I he political fence
from the New Mexican, ibnt neverthe
less It Advocates the holding of a con
stitutional convention as most likely
to bring about the much desired state
hood for New Mexico. It say:
"We regret to note that a part of
the press of the Territory are op
posed 'to the meeting of the Constltu
tiotval Convention on the ground that
statehood was defeated. In our opin
ion the iproper thing to do is to draft
a constitution and present It to Con
gress at an early day, and ask that
N'ew Mexico be admitted as a state.
Public sentiment is too strong to be
stemmed by Uncle Joe Cannon and
some of 'the other politicians who are
opposed to giving us our Just duos.
About fifty members of the last. Con
gress who were opposed to granting
single statehood to New Mexico have
been elected to stay at home and its
many new men have been elected to
take their places. We do not believe
that Roosevelt will seriously oppose
single statehood, and if he does not
nur chances for securing our rights
are very good. The Territorial Legis
lature will appropriate the necessary
money to moot the expenses, as it
should do. As delegates have been
chosen for this purpose we see no
good reason why they should not
meet and formulate a constitution.
We have everything to en In and
nothing to loose by adopting a con
stitution and presenting it to Con-
I gress."
E. C. ABBOTT ENTITLED TO HIS
SEAT.
"We cannot agree with the New
Mexican that Hon. Esqulpula Baca
would be an improvement upon E. C.
Abbott as member of the 'Legislative
Assembly. Mr. Baca has had some
official experience and Is a very good
man, but Mr. Abbott is especially
well fitted to discharge the duties of
legislator." I.as Vegas Optic,
The New Mexican has never Inti
mated directly or indirectly that Es
quipula, Baca would be an improve
ment upon E. C. Abbott as a member
of tho Legislative Assembly; quite
the reverse,- Had it not been for the
N'ew Mexican E. C. Abbott would not
have been nominated as the Republi
can candidflne from 'the Tenth Repre
sentative District consisting of the
ccuii'iles of Santa Fe and Sandoval
and, therefore, would not have been
elected to the position. Mr, Abbott
Owes his nomination and election pri
marily to the New Mexican, This pa
per supported him strenuously and ef
fectively dining the campaign. It
aided him materially in his race in
Sunloval County md ceitainly did
yeoman work for him in the county
of Santa Fe. These are the facts and
are undeniable. The Jew Mexican
lesiies Mr. Abbott to fill the sent to
which be was honestly and fairly
elected by the voters of the district
and by the aid and support of the
Daily .New Mexican, the Weekly New
Mexican and of El Nuevo Mexicano.
This pmpei does not propose to hide
this light under a bushel basket.
The President has just completed
a new canine deal and It is a .pleas
ing one to the country and to the
people. In connection therewith the
man who asserts that Mr. Roosevelt
was induced by Mr. So-and-So,- or
Senator tliis and It hat to select his
advisors, does not have a correct Idea
of the President's chaiacter and has
not kept tip with the trend of publi'
events since Theodore Roosevelt be
ca.me the chief executive of this na
tion. There is a man who doe his
own selecting and no mistake about it.
That Hammond, Indiana school
timelier, discharged because she "Is so
pretty that everybody falls in love
with her," Is reasonably Btire to get a
better job, through the advertising
given her beauty.
Though Ex-U. S. Senator Dubois
charges Secretary of War Taft with
knocking him out of his Senatorial
job, he has no idea of applying to the
War Department for "something" as
good.
Senators Morgan and Tillman have
at least one Idea In common that
the white man is and must continue
to be the whole show. But the latter
collects $100 per show.
That Governor-eleot Hughes of New
York has already proven a disappoint
ment to the ple-grribbers must be
mighty pleasing to a lot of voters In
his state.
Every man owning Just a million Is
willing that fortunes In excess of two
millions should pay-a special tax.
Speaking of special taxes, why
should the rich brides be allowed to
go scot free?
PORTUGAL'S COOL-HEADED KING.
Cirloi' Conduct In the Lisbon Disaster
. Won Acclamation.
London. It Is not very often that
we hear much of King Carlos in his
snug little kingdom of Portugal, but
he has certainly won the world's
acclamation for his coolness at the
Lisbon disaster coolness which alone
averted a frightful panic, when a
canopy fell on a state procession. The
private life of Portugal's monarch Is
rather interesting, because it Is more
like that of a private gentleman than
the daily round of a sovereign. As he
rises at five in the morning, he man
ages to get all his work done before
mid-day, then five days of the six he
gives over the afternoon and evening
to his one amusement sport.
KING CARLOS.
(The Popular Monarch of Little Por
tugal.) He has explored every corner of his
kingdom in his motor car, and a short
time since, when driving through some
out-of-the-way place, he had rather an
amusing experience. Arriving at a
small town, he found a crowd waiting,
but no one recognized him. In fact,
the chief point of Interest at that mo
ment was an old woman, who had had
her basket of eggs upset by those who
jostled her. The king, with his usual
good nature, approached and asked
what was the matter. "They say the
king Is coming through here to-day,
so these Idiots are waiting to see htm.
One cannot even do one's daily labor,
with this crowd watching for a fat,
lazy fellow, who does not work and
spends his time in eating." The king
laughed, presented her with a coin to
pay for the eggs, and to "remember
the fat, lazy fellow by," and a moment
more the royal car had vanished in a
whirl of dust before anyone knew It
had arrived save one dumbstruck
peasantwoman.

the ma yt- of horse racing at the coun

lieves In racing.
Mr. Williams is not a man who seeks
notoriety, but when a worldly matter
comes to his attention he speaks his
convictions. He prepared the follow
ing statement for the Journal:
There are two objections raised
against horse racing. Cruelty to the
horse and gambling. I do not consider
racing cruel, nor any more a task than
driving or working the hoise extra
time for pleasure or money. God

Is Right.)
kingdom. Man can lawfully use any
animal for bis profit or pleasure.
Horse racing Is not an evil within
Itself. The horse enjoys the race as
much as the athlete enjoys his games.
Gambling goes with racing. But if
we were to abandon all that is bet on
we would quit our political elections
and all that makes us good and great.
Everything that has chance In It is
gambled on. In all our work and
pleasure we should eliminate the evil.
This should be our practice in the
horse race.
The race is the chief support of the
county fair. I believe the county fair
a benefit; an inspiration to better
farming, There is a pleasure to and
enlivening of the tired man in watch'
lng the horse race. It breaks the
monotony of business life and gives
new energy and llfo to our daily tasks.
