ing too much. For tho first hour ot tho road-
Ins the Itcpubllcnn Benators. as a matter ot
formal courtesy, romninod in tholr seats and
pearly nil ruld attention to what Gen.
McCook was saying. Several ot the able Bon
xtor. howovor, were too preoccupied or too
lUltm to listen to the reading. Among theso
were senators l'lumb nnd Dawes, who read the
niornlug papers; V'olcottand Mnndorson.who
1,1 r hack In their chatrs and told tunny stories;
Dolpli. u ho' wrote luttors, ond Hoar, who
performed a very romarkablb act for, him. of
burying his head In, his arms on top ot his
desk anil losing himself in- slumbor or
thuutflit. Senator Ciwnoron talked to ills clork
form. hour, nnd Senator .Proctor followod tho
rinding of the messngo with a wise look of
lipiprietorihip. especially when tho portion
routing t'i tho W.ir Department was reached.
Tim otlur Senators malntatnod tholr dignity,
Int looked frightfully borod. . ,

tit t ntlun to tlio reading ot Presidents' mes
j8u -. .uid so it was that Bonators Vest and
11ivoivro tlio only Bonators on the Demo
cratic side who appeared to be listening to
anything tho message contained. Less than
eno-half of the Domocrats wore present in the
chamber. 31 r. Gorman, who is tho recognized
leader o( Ills party on tho floor, sat in his cen
tral scat, conferring with membors ot ,tho
Uoum and others who came to talk with him.
Senator (Korge, the groat Constitutional law
yer, turned his back squarely on Secretary
.McCook. possibly without any Intention ot
slighting either tho Secretory or tho President.
and read n newspapor during tho ontlro dreary
tno hours that wore consumod in tho reading.
In the House it is not tho custom to listen
to the roadlng of Presidents' messages, and
sotvliUotho blg-lunged clorks of that unwieldy
tody woro ploughing through their elocution
ary exercise tno 330 odd members chatted
and laughod. wrote letters, and read papers
without restraint, and thore were not a score
of the entire number who heard more than a
paragraph or two ot the thirty-six printed
4pes upon which the President had be
stowed such great care and labor. It was
thought that as most ot tho members
M art. now to Congressional life, they
' would be impressed with their own impor
tance as well as that of tho President, and
would Indicate their feelings by giving pro
found attention to his words of wisdom. They
did nothing ot the kind, however. They seem
to have been impressed thnB early with the
proverbial professional lack ot hero worship,
andthox went about getting acquainted with
.eacAplaer and finding out what their per
quisites am in the way ot patronage and docu
ments, without heedlng what the President
lulu tpitay about the Chilian question, the
gerrymandering of the Congress and legislative
alstrjetSf and the other important matters to
which; Ke refers. The general publio seemed
to be as unmindful ot the courtesy due the
President as tho Bonators and llepresenta
tives are.
Thore was merely a handful of spectators in
the gallerios of caoh House, and in the brown
seats of the diplomatic corps In the Senate
chamber thero wore five attache's ot various
legations, who seemod to bo very much sur
prised at tho cool treatment which the Presl-.
dent's recommendations met with at the
hands of the statesmen. Kach house ad
journed as soon as the last word of the Presi
dent's message had been delivered to thorn, and
at once croceeded to be interviewed in reply
to the question which comes to them yoar af
ter year: " What do you think of tho mes
' Face?" Tho ltepubllcans. especially thoso
who hadn't heard a word of it, said that it was
a strong document, and some of the Demo
crats s&jd so, too, especially Senator Morgan.
vmorn Mr. Harrison nod quoted as a friend
tvltn him of tio Klcaraguan Canal Company.

TUB SENATE COMMITTEES
Tho SenaU) oommltteo of nine, who aro re
constructing tlio Senate committees, nnd who
ozpoctod to be ablo to mako a roport to-day or
to-morrow, now find that tholr task will not
be completed until some tlmo next weok. Ono
of the committeemen said to-dny that If ho had
known how fussy United States Senators ore
when it comos to getting committoo assign
ments he would have refused the tank which
he nnd his colleagues havo on hand. The com
mittee held n protracted session to-dny. and
accomplished n great doaL Thoy. still havo
many little dllTorenoes and jealousies , to
overcome, however, one ot tho most nnnoylng
bolng the somewhat bold ambition ot Senator
Stewart of Nevada to become u member of tlio
Committoo on Appropriations. This Is one of
tho moat important committees of Congress,
ond in some respects tlio most influential ot
nil. Tho Sonate always has Its way In tho llnnl
strugglo on appropriations, especially when
controversies reach tho stage of oonforonco
oommlttoos. Mr. Btewnrt. his eolleagues say,
has no partloular clnlris to the very prom
inent and Influential placo whloh ho seeks ex
cept that he isono of tho most constant de
baters In tho Nonato. He Is lying back on the
prop of sonlority as effected by Senatorial
courtesy, howovor. nnd notwithstanding tho
opposition of most ot tho Senators, particular
ly Mr. Washburn, who wants the jplnoo himself.
Mr. Sto wart Is hopeful that he will win.
MILTJ9 FKELINQ VKBT SORE.
Representative Mills is aufforing from the
reaction of tho terrihlo strain of tho last few
days that resulted In his defeat for the Speak
ership nomination. He has been besiegod
with inquiries about his future course, bulls
not in a mood at presont to take the publio in
to his confidence Mr. Mills Is physically and
mentally a sutTcror.and does not wish to mako
publio his Intentions with regard to his future
politloal oourso until he has had time to think
over tho situation. The tact that ho was
sulky yesterday and refused to accom
pany the Houso Committoo to wait
upon tho President, nnd tho further fact that
ho purposoly soloctod a seat In an out-of-tho-way
part of the hall, has led to the roport that
ho Intends to accept his dofeat as an an
nouncement that his policy Is no longer to do
thrust UDon the Democratic nnrtv In thn
House, and to keep himself In the background
accordingly. In answer to this report Mr.
Mills deollnos to talk, but contents
himself to say sarcastically that lying
Booms to be indulged in by certain per
sons. The dofoated candidate for Bpcakor
feols vory sore, not entirely, perhaps,
because of tho dofoat of his personal ambition
to sit in tte Speaker's ohair. but because ho is
lnolinod tlTrogard tho eloation ot Mr. Crisp as
n significant rebuko to tho policy of which he
has been a conspicuous advocate for many
years. Mr. Mills, howevor. is a very Impetuous
man. art to do things on Impulso nnd afterward
regret his notions. Itwns this charactorlstlo
that led him to say last spring that ho desired
to go to tho Senate from Texas, and conso-
3uently would not bo a candldato for tho
poakership. Had he not made this unneces
sary romark he might havo farod hotter In tho
fight that closed last Monday evening.
Whether Mr. Hills could now como to tho Bon
ate, if ho so desired, is a question which no
one In Washington sooms nblo to answer.
Senator Chilton, who was on Monday sworn In
to fill the unexpired terra of Senator liengan.
which will oxplre In 1803, will bo n candldato for
reelection, and thore aro othor Texas cent le
mon who will display a like ambition. Mr.
Mills was not a supposter ot Chilton for tho
place, and It Is possible that he might not be
nble to overcomo tho opposition of his rivals.
The Sonatorship will be vacant on tho day that
his present term In tho Houso expires, and the
result of next year's elections may havo a con
trolling influence upon his future action.
td2.ee rmzs and eletex lives lost.
Tour Flreaieat Six 'Working; Girls, and a
Bnalmess Man Killed.
Louisville. Dec. 0. In a series of fires on
West Main street to-day oleven lives havo
been lost, nearly $500,000 worth of prop
erty destroyod. and several singular ac
cidents occurred. In t tho early even
ing the store and stock of the Boone
Paper Company was destroyed, entailing
A loss o( $85,000. At 2:35 o'clock this morn
ing an explosion occurred in the adjoining
building ocouplod by Bamberger, Strong k
Co. The shaky walls crumbled, and before
It was subdued the stores ot Bamberger.
Strong iCo.. Bliss. Wilson k, Co.. Johanbocke
& Sons, and Miller. Wool! oik. Payne & Co. had
been gutted. At least four nromen were
burled under falling walls, all honk and ladder
men. Four others are badly hurt. Tho dead
firemen are William Mooro. William Davis,
Bamuel Baker, and Tony Bchllcht.
At S o'clock another fatal fire began. It was
In F. A. Menu & Co.'s wholesale candy and
fireworks house, a square abovo the Boono
Paper Company's building. Forty girls were
at work wrapping candy on the fourth floor.
The lire was out at 11 o'clock, and the work of
taking out tho bodies began. Tho bodies of
six girls wore soon takon out, burned beyond
identification. O. T. Monn, brothor of tho
senior member ot the firm. Is supposod to havo
been burned to death. The lire cut off escape
by the stairway leading to tho fourth floor,
where the girls wore at work, and mnny
jumped from 'the windows to a second story
projection and oscapod with broken limbs and
bruised bodies. Others got out unhurt.
The flro in tho Boono paper company's build
ing was supposed to be fully extinguished a
little after 8 o'clock last night, and later all
tho engines were withdrawn. With Its forces
woakonedand demoralized by the accident of
the early morning to tho ladder men. tho Flro
Department was called to tlio third disaster at
the candy factory.
To add to the casualties and tlio contusion
Major Hughes, Chief of tho Fire Department,
was so badly hurt in an accldont oarly this
Bornlng that ho may not rocover. Ho and
ear weathorford, his assistant, started
up Market street. Thoy got on tho
wrong side ot the street. The snlvago
corps wagou ran into their buggy
and ran over them. The buggy was smashed
and tho salvage horses trampled on both Chief
Hughes and Weathorford. The letter's wrist
was badly hurt, and whon tho Chief called nut
for help Weatherford was unable to go to his
assistance. Major Hughes was takon to hit
bed, and tho doctors fear serious results.
While on the way to the fire No. 13 Englno ruu
into the ourb at Twolfth street nud Broadway,
throwing oft Engineer Nuttall, hurting his
back ana probably crippling him tor life. Pat
Shea, a member ot No. 1 Hook and Ladder
Company, was at work on the building occu-
Jiled by Frank A. Monn k Co. Ho startod to
all. but grabbed ut tho broken skylight Ho
saved himself from probably n fatal plunge,
but nearly severed his hand from his arm ut
tho wrist.
In the face of thoso disasters tho flro men
kept ut tholr work. 'Tho water-tower was
manned and u dozon streams brought to bear
on Monn's place. Within hnlf an hour tho
flames were under control. Of tho forty girls,
two escaped at tho cost of grievous wounds.
They wore Theresa Hulthaus and Lizzie Mc
Oincy. Ono of them hus a broken leg
and the injuries of the othor woru in
ternal. The flro is supposed to havo
orlglnutod from ono of the cnmly furnaces,
which possibly oxnlodod. Tho Ilamos com
municated with tho now and.' big stock ot
Cnrlstmus fireworks. The first explosion
among the llreworkH scattered the firebrands
all ovor tho store. Tho skylight toll in and tho
entire stock, much ot which was highly In
flammable, was llorcely blazing utmost imme
diately. The skyrockets, itoman candles, nnd
giant firecrackers wore wild In their hnvoo
nnd Impeded tho work of the flrcraon, making
It exceedingly dangerous for them until tho
last one had exploded.

An Mr. Barrlngcr, Who Had Called Uer
aeirJDe Casanova, In Accused of Forgery.
Mrs. Julia F. Barrlnger, a monoy broker do
ing business at 10 East Fourteenth street, wa:
a prisoner at the Essex Market Police Court
yesterday, charged with forgery.
It appears by her statements that In May last
Emll Castillo, a Spanish money broker, told
her he had $100,000 to invest. Ha wanted her
to lend out that money and charge 30 per cent
Interest on all loans under $5,000 and 50 per
cent on all loans ovor that amount. They
were to share tho profits and Castillo sug
gested that the should not use her own name,
and proposed that she should call herself Kosa
U. De Cazanova. In July she lent $350 ot Cas
tillo's money to Mrs. Carrie Tralrs of 130 West
Thirty-sixth street The loan was paid in
September and Mrs. Barrlnger gave a reoelpt,
signing herself "ltosa B. De Cazanova."
Now Mrs. Rosa B. Do Cazanova of 35 East
Thirty-first stroot comes forward and charges
Mrs. Barrlnger with forgery. Sho says she
gave money to Castillo to Invest Mrs. Bar
rlnger says she.dld not know that a woman
named Bosa B. Do Cazanova existed. She also
declares that her nrreut was an act of rovongc.
as sho had quarrelled with Castillo u few
weeks ago.
Justice Duffy held the defendant In default
of $1,500 bull for examination on Tuesday

The defence then showed by Drs. Norrls M.
Carter and P. L. Schenck that at tho time of
the shooting young Meserolo was suffering
from an organlu trouble which ho hud hud for
years, and from a constitutional disease. The
effect of those trouldos was to physically

About n year nnd a half ago tho woddlngof
Mr. Philip Livingston Livingston nnd Miss
Juliet Blrchoad Morris took placo in St Bar
tholomew's Church. The Bus of April 17,
1800. says that overy pew was filled with Now
York's fashlonablo people Tho ceremony was
hold amid n bowor of palms, laurel wreaths,
and flowors placod about tho ohancol. Tho
bridosmatds woro protty gowns of white laoo

Tho brldo was beautiful and radiant
After tho ceremony a largo recoptlon was hold
at tho houso ot tho bride's parents, Mr. and
Mrs. Willlatfl A. Morris. 11 West Flfty-socond
stroot. and this was followod by a dinner In tho
ovonlng.
It Is to bo expected, therefore that some
what of a sensation will bo caused in social
clrclos noxt wook when the young couple aro
summonod to appear In tlio Supromo Court to
answer a complaint Instituted by thu groom's
own mother chnrglng thorn with docoptlon
and fraud in an attempt to deprive, her
of all tho property left to hor by
hor husband's wilt It was tho blushing
brldo. according to tlio complaint of the
mothor. that Instigated her son, while they
jvore still nwny on tholr wedding tour, to de
"fraud hor of her proporty. No sooner bad tho
honeymoon ended, the mothor declares, than
tho son mado out deeds of conveyance, and
prevailed upon her, by falso roprosentatlon, to
sign them, thereby transferring thu tltlo of tho
proporty from hor to himself.
In 1&J2 Mr. Livingston Livingston, tho hus
band ot Mrs. Mary C Livingston, who makos
the complaint and tho father of young Philip
L. Livingston; died, leaving by his will all of
his proporty to his wife. Tho proporty con
sisted of a houso and lot nonr Fort Leo. N. ,T
and throo houses and lots In Now York city 17
West Twenty-eighth street 22 Wost Nino
teonth stroot and 27 Bloockor stroot bcsldos
somo mortgages on Brooklyn property and
somo furniture contained In tho houses. In
regard to tho son, who was nn only child, thu
will reads:
"Having soon thoevll offoctof giving out
right real and personal estate to a young man
with little exporleneo of Ufo. I have given all
my real and personal estate to my wife abovo
named, with the understanding between us
thut she bIiuII gii e to my son. Philip Livingston,
such portion of my estate, real und personal, as
she snail in her judgmeut seo tit and proper,
using her own discretion when and utwhut
ago sho shall give it. This 1 do out of tho
great affection 1 have for my son."
With tho property left to hor Mrs. Livingston
educated her son. Ho was graduated from
Harvard Collego and from tho Columbia Law
bchool. Thou he began the practice of law us
clerk lu tho ofllco of Turner. McCluro & ltol
ston. In January. 1800. when tho marriago be
tween young Livingston und Miss Morris was
in contemplation. Mrs. Lii ingslon gai e her ton
tho house and lot In Twent -sixth stroot. act
ing iu uctordanoo with tlio agreement men
tioned In tlio will. This proporty hud boon left
to Mrs. Llvlngbton unencumbered. When she
gavo it to her son it hud been mortgaged for
t25.000. and vas convoyed to him subject to
that in ortguge.
Young Livingston was marrlod on April 10,
1800. When ho returned from his bridal tour
on April 30 he held consultations with his
mother about the bad stute of her property.
which was houvily mortgaged and encum
bered. Unless something wore done, ho said,
tho mortgages would bo foreclosed and sho
would Jose It nil. -Bhe hndS spoken of Helling
her Nlnctoenth street house hnd buying an
annuity In somo life Insurance company with
the proceeds, nnd ho proposed to take
tho property himself itnd give her tho samo
annuity that nn Insurance company would
give. A house In Fifty-third street, which had
been bought In place of the liloeckar stroot
houso which Mrs. Livingston had sold, he
offered to mako a siuiilur urrangoment for.
On May 3 Mrs. Livingston cousoutod to sign
two deods which convoyed thoso two houses
to her son, nnd lie promised hor In return
an unnuity of $1,350 for tho Nineteenth street
houso nndun annual payment of $1,050 on
the Fifty-third streot houso. Theso doeds
were sicued on tho evening of May 3. beforo a
notary In tho Indies' parlor of tne Murray Hill
llotol. whore Mrs. Livingston was stopping.
Livingston's wife had receiied a flower on
her marriage, and her father. Mr. William A.
Morris, being a rich man, Livingston wus uble
to ralso monoy to pay off back taxes and In
terest on tho mortgage which hnd threatened
the property, und ho paid his mother $141.07
as tho first Installment on her annuity.
About two weeks later Mrs. Livingston do
mnndod tho return of hor prorurty. giving as
herllrst reason that she was unwilling to be
dependent upon her son and his wife. She
also said that sho hud no security for hor un
nuity. and thut if hor son should dlo she would
bo loft penniless. Tho son told her It
was for her own good thut she should
not halo control of the property. Ho
refused to restore It to her. Whilo matters
were In this stnto the. son mndo a deed
of trust convoying tho proporty to Edward Ly
man Short, of tho Inw firm of Davles. Short A.
xownsonu. so us to guarantee to nm mother
thu payment of her annuity. Mrs. Livingston
would bo satisfied with nothing but tho an
nulment of the deods ami tho return of tho
property. Whon her son refused to comply
with liorronuesthho put hor case in thu hands
of Ei arts, Choate A Heaman. and directed thorn
to bring suit. Livingston put his defence with
Turner. McCluro .V Kolston.
Tho mother ullogos that her son on return
ing from his bridal iour mo persistently Impor
tuned and entreated her to sign the deeds that
she booaino sick nnd nervous nnd Incapable ot
exercising hnr judgmont fiho says also that
ho eumo to her late In tho evening on May 3
and roprcHontod to her that It wus tho ono pos
sible means of saving her property. This, sho
suvh. was fraud and deception. Ho took her
property from hor without compensation or
security, nnd then whon sho demanded it buck
ho secretly deeded It over to u friend who was
a party to his plans.
It was with great struggles and sacrifice, tho
complaint stutcs, that sho supported and
c (located her son In a liberal manner, befitting
his family and his station. To do this It was
nocossary to mortgago certain portlous of hor
property. For more than two years before
his marrlngo sho hud given him ubso
luto management und control of tho
property, and relied Implicitly on his ud
liee. Hho had given him tho houso In
Twenty-sixth street sevornl mouths before, in
contemplation of his mnrringe, nnd always
was liberal and confiding toward him. lie
was cortainly Instigated to do what he did by
his wife, slio says, and u member nf her family,
Thu son moots his mother's charges with a
wholesale denial. Ho declares that his mother
was in tho bestot health and Understanding
whon sho ncrood to the provisions of thedeedh.
He donles that ho importuned or entreated her
in tlio least. Iu fact, ho goes K) fur as to suy
that his mother was qultu put out with him be
cause his business engagements compelled
him to defor bringing thu deeds to her for
a day. Hho understood them perfectly,
nnd ho did nothing then or afterward to
deceive her lu tho least Ilo denies
fiolnt blank thnt his young wife or hor father
uid anrtliluirto do with lnstiuutlmr him in bis
action. Ho denies that Ills mother was fnieed
to struggle und suorillcu to support and odu
cutu him. lie received an allowance of id.MH)
a year whilo at Harvard College, but that ho
thinks, was moderate uud reasonable. His
solo motive In having the property transferred
to him wus to save It Irom total loss. His mother
had shown herself lncapublo of mauaglng
it.and unloss hu could get It Into his own hands
he feared thnt she would soon have nothing
with whloh to Hiipport herself, and he wus not
well enough off himself to maintain her. This
also was the reuson horeluscd to annul thu
eeds and give hor back the property when she
demanded It. He justifies his position by de
scribing thu exact condition of the property.
On Mtiy 3. when tho deeds of conveyance
woro muds, all thut remained of the estute left
by his father, renl and personal, were tho
premises 5 East Fllty-thlrd street und 22 West
Mnotconth street Thoso were mortgagod for
S4B.50O. Theiental valuo of the Nineteenth
street house was about $2,200 and tho rental
value of the Fllty-thlrd street house, furnished,
was about $3,750, so that thn aggregate
gross receipts wero about 5,0.r0. Irom this
it wus necessary to pay Interest, taxes, instit
utive, und lupuirs, aggregating bcucely less
than :i.'.'5(), so that tlio utmoi-t income Mrs.
Llviiuston could lApect to leech c, from h"i
propel t lex if they should I (niilniiiilly renti d
was $2,700. AndthlfWaHiinly InciiMi hho could
be prevailed upon to liv o upon thn Inroiiiuulotiu
without encroaching still further on the prin
cipal, something sho had not boon ablo to do
in the pust Moreovor. Intertst moneys, taxes,
nud othor chargos on tho properties wore at
thetima unpaid, making InaUafiumexgeed..

Ing $1,850, Tho mortgageo had been com
plaining about tho arrears nnd had threaten
ed to foreclose, so thnt this sura It was abso
lutely necessary that sho should pay nt onco.
Hor financial condition thoroforo. It seemed
to tho son, was very gravo and sorlous, nnd
palled for lmmodlatn action. Bho admitted
this as well as he. All this, ho says, oviusod
him groat distress and anxiety respecting tho
future support and well-being of his mothor.
Ho know woll that In consoquonco of her ex
travagant habits und her loose huslnoss moth
oils It would bo nlmost Impossible for hor to
reduce her expenditures down to tho amount
ofhqrlncomo. Itwns almost certain. In his
mind, that sho would bo unwilling to do so no
matter what the consoquonco might be.
Mrs. Livingston hnd on various occasions
for somo two years previous expressed her in
tention of selling tho Mnotconth street prop
orty nnd devoting tho net proceeds to tho pur
chase of nn annuity upon hor llfo. Ho bad en
couraged tho Idea, ho says. On May 1
they computed together tho amount of
lions upon tho Nlnctoonth stroot prop
Srty.M "l"1 t,m. and mado tho amount
$111,500. , Tho property itsolf they ngrood
was worth about $30.0)0. so there remained
a not value of only $10,705. Thoro was. more
over, tno taxes of ihwi to pay and six months'
interest on tho mortgago of tho Fifty-third
stroot houso. ond thoro wus no other source
to get this monoy from but the nalo of the
Nineteenth street house, so these sums had
to be deducted. TheyamotintodtoaboutSl.200,
leaving tho not valuo of tho Nineteenth street
houso at $0,505. To make a round sum this
was oallod $10,000, Mrs. Livingston ngroolng
to mnko up tho difference from her annuity.
Her ago at tho time was 71. nnd on computation
the prppor annuity was found to be $1,333.33.
Ho thereupon agreed to pay her an annuity
of $1,350 If sho wouldjlona over tho property
to him. A somowhat similar computation was
mado in regard to tho Fifty-third street house,
und the annuity from It wns fixed nt $1,050.
Mrs. Livingston thoroughly understood, ac
cording to her son's statement tho exaot
nature of tlifjr agreement and directed him to
draw up the proper deods. This ho did. and on
May ,i she signed them. On reooiving tho con
vqynncesLlvlngston borrowed on thom from his
wito $1,500. whloh onnblod him to pay off tho In
terest nnd taxes thon in arrears. He paid his
mother her first monthly installment fn cash,
and sho accepted It without objection. Living

governed solely by filial uffectlon for his
mothor nnd by interest In her welfare. At no
time, no says, has he boen in receipt ot any
Burplus money abovo tho chargos and ex-
Sensqs of tho property. On th contrary, on

Large, Where I the Mysterious Kaa j
with a Red Fae who Itronisa Bays "Of

Mickey Sllnoy created a bigger sensation '$
'when ho confessed to Inspector Byrnes that M
ho had soon Bob Lyons, tho Chorry street ',I
butchor, murdered than oven tho murdor of J
tho young butchorcroatod. All that was talkod ?
about in Cherry stroot yesterday was the 1- J
legedoonfossion. Thoro was some doubt thai , ,
ho had Implicated Jim Lyons In the matter. , '
bocnuso Inspector Byrnes and Sllnoy s lawyora
wero quoted in all tho morning papers '
donylng that part of the story. The Inspector .,?.'
and tho lawyors reasserted yesterday that th '''
story was untrue. "Absolutely false In ever
particular," said tho Inspector. , T, j
"Had Sllnoy mado a confession I would hava d
known It My belief is that no confession has IJj
boon mado. Anything published to the con-
trary Is cortainly falso," sold Lawyor House. '" ;'.
"I know nothing at all about the ease. I " j
do not bollovo tho Btory ot the oonfoislon, -v
said Mr. Lovy.
"I can state positively thnt Sllnoy made no j
contosslon to any of his lawyors." said Mr. j
Frlond. .

Bllney said that Jim Lyons did the killing. Aa '
much was said to a Sun reporter yesterday br f

young man's mothor, called on him also In tho I
morning. Whon sho loft sho sold that Mlcker :
had told hor ho would bo froe In a few days. !
Mlckoy seemod to onjoythe notoriety ho was 4
getting. Ho laughod and jokod with all his IV
cullers. j
As much of SUney's confession or statement U?
as can bo obtained is this: Ho left Lyons'a Hf
storo at 4:10 o'clock tho afternoon ot tho raur- J
tier, as ho has insisted all along that he did. i
Ho went across tho street to his mother's l n
houso. and, sticking hiB head into tho door.
said. Mothor. I'm, going to the stonra power. ',
Toll fathor. so ho will know whnt has becomo I
of tho horses. Thon he thought it would bo '
necessary to borrow Bob Lyons's dress suit to .'
wearto a wedding In tho ovonlng. Ho didn't '',
havo ono of his own. and he had worn 'I
Bob's onco beforo. Ho wont back to tho j
butchor shop, nnd was about going into the j
plncu whon ho saw Jim Lyons strlko the blow .
with tho cleaver that, nearly severed Bob
Lyons s houd from his body. Ho ran right ''
awny. i
How much faith Inspoctor Byrnes puts in i
tho story is shown by tho fact that Jim Lyons
is still at liberty, and thoro Is no intimation !
that he is to bo arrested. Jim Lyons talkoa -1
about tho story yesterday. He said It was
foolish and ridiculous. Ho accountod for -
overy moment of his time tho day ot tho mur
dor ud to tho tlmo that Policeman Breen told ;.
him that his brothor Bob had been cut and ha "0
ran as fast as he could for a doctor. Ho gava ,i t
thn nnmes of his witnesses to prove all that ha It
said, nnd they boro him out in his statement.
Hut Jim's denial did not stop the Inhabitants
of Chorry street from talking. They said that )
Bob's rather was worth from $50,000 to $100,- '
000. and that if Bob dlod. Jim would coma ''
Into possession of nil the property. That
might bo a motive for a crime that was lack
ing in SUaoy's case. But finally thoy dismissed f
the matter. Jim. they said, was too manly a
young follow to bo guilty ot nuy such ortme.
and Blinoy had mudo tho statomont to In
spoctor Byrnes just to clenr hlmsolf. Ther
predicted that It would be a boomerang, anqt
in tho end Sllnoy would find he bad hurt hla '
case Irreparably. Jim. thoy said, donied tba
story positively. He had not been caught In a
single Ilo in connection with the case, whila
SUney. by making tho confession, confessed
thut ho hnd boon lying all along, whon he had
said ho knew nothing at all about the murder
sal o that he was accused falsely of committing
it So Chorry streot clcurcd Jim.
Hero aro a few facts for Bun readers to think .
ovor. Whether Mlckoy Sllnoy told tho truth In (I
tho'alloged confession, or whether he Had. - i!
Whatever object he may have had In making
the alleged confession, it Is reasonably certain. it
as Tub Sun has shown, that Mickey SUney did :i
not commit that murder, and that Acting Cap- "(i
tain Fitzgerald ot the Boventh precinct mode a ' i
big mistake when ho assumed that the boy :,
was guilty and devoted all of his tlmo and Ii
talent to proving It, Instead ot running ov- '
ery clue to tho ground. Itisreusonaly certain '
that Bob Lyons was not killed in tho butcher I
shop, as Acting Captain Fitzgerald assumed.
The story of the crime Is pictured by the blood r
murks in tho passageway botweon the storo i
nud tho dining room in tho roar plainer than '
words can toll it. Bob Lyons was killed in that t
puhsngoway.
With Jim Lyons accounted for nnd Mlcker y.
fillney accountod for. tho red-faced man who. V
the boy Hroulsh told James Love and others, t:
gavo tho mysterious note to Bob Lyons that :
took tho boy out of tho store so that the mur- " i
tier could be dono without interferenoo comes ':
to tho front again. Who wus ho? Perhaps In
spector Byrnes will find out Porhaps Inspoo- '
tor Byrnes knows.
Mrs. Martin Lyons, tho mother ot the mur- -!
derod man and ot Jim. was taken siofc yester-
day. Her sickness wabdue.it was said, to the , ',,
apparently unjust accusation mado against 't
herself and hor son.
