HIGH SCHOOL AGAIN.
From vow on, until the location of the county high school
is finally settled, the people are to be bombarded with peti
tions and arguments in favor of one or other of the proposed
locations. The decision rests first with the county board of
education acting as a high school board. This board is or
ganized and ready for business. It requires a unanimous
vote of the board to permanently locate the school. Failing
to agree on this pomt — and there is little hope for any other
outcome — the board may decide upon a temporary site by a
majority vote. The board is composed of five members, so
that three can fix the temporary location, and refer it to the
voters to determine the permanent location at a special elec
tion called for that purpose. The decision of the board as to
the temporary location will be a decided advantage in the
special election. We understand that each place contesting
for the honor of having the high school must be prepared
with the offer o f a site. This is probably designed to insure
a suitable site at a fair price, andjnot to be construed as re
quiring the site to be free of charge to [the taxpayers who
have voted for the establishment of the school. The latter
interpretation seems to be entertained by not^a few, but in
our opinion is demoralizing and out 'of joint with the prin
ciples of law and justice. Among the arguments trotted out
to induce the board to settle the matter finally by a unani
mous vote for Sutter Creek it is urged that the county would
thereby be. spared the expense of a special election. The
same argument might be used with equal force in behalf of
any other proposed location. But the bare fact of saving the
cost of a special election is worthy of no consideration what
ever when opposed to the honest conviction of the board as to
the most suitable place from the viewpoint of accommodation
and accessibily to the greater number of likely pupils.
: It is rumored that subscriptions are being solicited from
individuals to influence the selectiou of the site by hotding
out a fat purse for the building and equipment of the school,
thereby offering relief to the general taxpayers from the whole
or part of the burden. This course might not be objection
able after the location has been settled, as a grateful appre
ciation of the residents of the successful locality. But to
adopt this method beforehand seems to us a vicious and
corrupting policy unworthy of being countenanced [in any
public cause, and particularly reprehensible in a high school
movement.
THE PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE.
President Taft's first message to congress will [serve to al
lay any apprehension in the public mind as to liklihood of
any disturbance of business interests by a tendency toward
extrein.e radicalism, He is fully abreast of the demand for
a pause in the eiiactment of laws intended to further curb the
big coiporations in their activities. He recommends the
enforcement of existing anti-trust laws, and ascertaining defi
nitely the effect thereof, before proceeding to place any
more laws on the statute books on this subject. He is also
opposed to any attempt at a general revision of the tariff at
this time, leaving modifications to be made, one schedule at a
time, at the recommendation of a permanent tariff board,
after an impartial and scientific investigation. The present
tariff, notwithstanding the- severe and in a great measure un
just criticism to which it has beeu subjected, has worked
fairly well in practice. It has largely increased the revenues
showing that was a revision downward in [accordance with
the declaration of the platform of the last/ republican na
tional convention. At the same time there has been no seri
ous disturbance of business on account of the changes; show
ing that the measure is wisely framed both from the stand
point of the consumer and manufacturer. That it may be
improved upon is not doubted, but the president believes
that this can be better accomplished by amendment by the
tariff board thau by the drafting of a new bill covering the
whole field. '
Another strong point is the recommendation for the prac
tice of strict economy in all branches of,,the government,
without impairment of efficiency. As emphasising this mat
ter, under the administration of the present postmaster-gen
eral a saving of fifteen million dollars has been effected
in one year. And the president favors the same rigid
economy applied all along the line.
All through, the message is a conservative and business
like document. It creates the impression that a statesman
of the highest order is at the head of the government, under
whose guiding hand all the vast interests of the nation will
be zealously safe-guarded.

"Efficiency" is the watchword of
the hour, and it is being applied not
only to the human unit, the individual
specialized to fill in the most helpful
manner his place in the evolving plan
of Nature, but to the plant and animal
attendants upon man and even to
Mother Earth herself. It has been re
cently estimated that the nitrogen
taken from the air by elctrical means
will add 60 per cent to the productive
ness of the soil. Recent years have
shown that the earth's yield is to be
further increased by such means as
intelligent rotation of crops, the best
use of nitrifying organisms, more at
tention to the action ot sunlight and
heat in preparing soil for seed and a
better understandng of the disinfection
of soils from the plant poisons left by
growing crops. Electrification of the
air above plants has been found to
have great influence. Sir Oliver Lodge
finds that it has always existed, and
he and others are endeavoring to so in
tensify and adapt it artificially as. to
get the J greatest possible results in
agriculture. Even more is expected
from ecientie breeding. Improvements
of breeds of plants and animals' has
become a world undertaking, and the
astonishing achievements already made
give promise that man's wants are to
be even better supplied in future, with
an increase in abundance that will pro
vide for a great increase of the world's
population.
Modern industries give liability to
fire where water is not only ineffective
but dangerous as ah extinguisher, and
the use of sand is among the substi
tutes. The new fire apparatus of Lon
don on electric lighting station is a
,ruck holding 600 pounds of sand and
carrying a fiber bucket and a couple of
spades. Tnis equipment is specially
adapted for the purpose, and is advised
for motor garages, oil stores, electric
theatres, "etc.
""'The Weather Service of Prussians,
is to be supplemented by a special
aeronautical service. The Aeronautical
Observatory at Lindenberg, proposes
making regular observation of upper
air currents by captive balloon, and
issuing an' afternoon weather map.
Lacking water-power for developing
cheap electrical energy, engineers in
England are beginning to turn their
attention to the tides. - In a paper read
the other day to the Ipswich Engineer
ing Society. W. O. Hornsnail pointed
out that to make tidal power profit
able now there must be available a
natural pound, which should be free
trom use for navigation, must require
only a short dam to close it to the
sea, and should have a minimum tidal
range of at least ten feet. Such con
ditions many be found along the Essex
coast and similar low-lying shores
with moderate tides. Some use of tide
power has been made for hundreds of
years, cyrn having been ground by it
in the eleventh century, but the early
method was the turning of a wheel by
the current flowing back and forth in
natural channel. For this inefficient
plan the storage of water during the
rise of the tide and its use as a con
siderable fall only during the outward
flow has been substantitued. A tide
mill at Woodbridge, still regularly
grinding corn, has a shallow pound of
10,000 square feet, with a tide range
of 10>2 to 13}£ feet, and the wheel is
worked with a fall of 5 feet, continu
ing 4J-2 to s>o hours at each tide. The
undershot wheel, 14 feet in diameter
snd 6 feet wide, develops 10 or 12
horse-power at 6 revolutions a minute.
The tide mill at St. Osyth had a pound
of 1,120,000 square feet and used two
wheels, each 18 feet in diameter by 4 6
feet wide and credited with 20 horse
power. *
Each kind of soil is found by A.
Muntz to have a definite moisture
limit, below which seeds actually dry
up inetead of gaining. In a sandy
soil, 0.5 per cent of water is sufficient
for germination ; with loams the re
quired percentage is from 2.5 to 7.0
according as the proportion of clay in
creases; and with garden soil, contain
ing a large proportion of humus, near*
ly 19 per cent of water must be pre
sent before germination can take
place.
A newly-patented British lamp is a
Geissler tube, coated on the inside
with phosphorescent sulphides and
tilled with helium or other rarefied
gas. The passage of an electric cur
rent through the 'tube excites the
phosphorescent lining, producing a
brilliant and economical white light.
A aolution of the problem of eterlllz
ing milk without altering its ferments
it claimed by a Kuenian chemist.
When the sterilization is brought
about by boiling-water temperature,
the milk Is rendered inert by the de
composition of its albuminolc bodied
and their salts, and feeding infants
with! such milk is regarded as the
cause of many deaths. Heating even
to 62 deg. C, If continued several
minutes, destroys the ferments and
antitoxins. It is found, however, that
healing to 72 deg to 80 deg. C, will
give complete sterilization in a few
seconds, and that In this . short time
the milk itself is not altered. 'io effect
this heating, the milk is broken up in*
to fine globules by forcing it into a
iterilized vessel by a spray of steam
or compressed air. It is at once con*
denned, and is allowed to drop into a
receiver, where it is cooled. The
germ-destroying action on the sprayed
drops is rapid and energetic. The air
spray has no other effect whatever,
but with steam spray the milk becomes
diluted about 10 to 15 per cent.
An electrically lighted life-buoy has
been brought out by 'an English firm
for use in places where workers are
axposed to the risk of drowning, as
in dock and on ship-board. It curries
two 9 candle-power electric lamps
above the water and two below the
surface, and in clear weather the light
from these is visible to a . considerable
distance. The two primary batteries
feeding the lamps are sealed until the
buoy is lifted from its rack. This
action automatically lights the lamps,
and they continue illuminated for three
or four hours. The weight of the
buoy is but 25 pounds. In the tests
made, a man of average weight was
carried by the buoy while lying across,
and three men kept their heads up by
its means when their bodies were
submerged.
Concentrating in a few central
stations the burning of all coal used
for electric power is the remedy of G.
H. Merz for reducing Londonls smoke.
These large stations, with tall chim
neys, would effectively 'consume the
fuel, and would give an estimated
annual saving of 6,000,000 tons of coal.
By using the electric current for cook
ing and other domestic purposes as
well as lighting, smoke would be still
further lessened.

A Marvelous Acre
What is considered the most wonder
ful acre in the world is in Glenn
county, and was once a tiny fraction
of a great wheat field. Samuel O.
Cleek bought it nearly 30 years ago.
There was no water for it, ; but Mr
Cleek put down two wells and found
water enough for his acre. Every toot
ox that acre is in use. Here is an in
ventory :
Cottage and veranda, 30x30 feet;
barn and corral, including two chicken
houses, 75x75 feet; two windmill
towers, 16x16 feet; garden, 46x96 feet;
citrus nursery, 90x98 feet, containing
400 budded orange trees ; a row of dew
berries along the fence, 100x2 feet ;
four bearing apricot trees, two oak
trees, six fig trees, ten locust trees,
one paradise tree, four bearing bread
trees, thirty rose bushes, 20 geraniums.
12 lemon trees, a lime tree, eight
bearing orange trees, five pomegranite
trees, six beds of violets, 6x2 feet
each, one patch Japanese bamboo, one
bed calla lillies, four prune trees, six
cypress trees, 14 stands of bees, four
huge grapevines, one bed of sage, one
large garden and flower seed bed, be
side honeysuckle and other rare and
beautiful plants and shrubs.
This is probably the best example of
what an acre can do that bas ever been
worked out in America. This acre has
not ony supported Mr and Mrs Cleek,
but they have long been able to put
aside several hundred dollars yearly.
The size of the acre depends upon
the farmer who owns it.

Miner Meets a
Sudden Death
Word was received by Mr and Mrs
Thomas J. Seymour of this city, that
the brother of Mrs Seymour, a miner
named Lewis, was instantly killed by
a fall in a mine shaft at his place of
employment in Grass Valley last
week.
The unfortunate man was standing
on a plank which was laid across the
shaft when a fellow worker accidental
ly pushed the end of the plank off its
supports, allowing the victim to plunge
headlong into the shaft, killing him
instantly.
Mr and Mrs Seymour left for the
home of the deceased to attend the
funeral, which was held on Monday
last.
