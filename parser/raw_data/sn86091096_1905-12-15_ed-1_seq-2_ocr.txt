BY JfJLES ADAMS POWELL.
I T was th* day before Christmas.
Dame Yarrow stood in the store-room
doorway, gowned in a warm frock of
gray wool homespan, over which wa*
tied an ample white apron. Her
wkite-capped head nodded aa ahe counted
the pies on the shelves.
"Fifteen pumpkin—fifteen mince—fif
ty custard cup* and two plum puddings
—eighty-two in all, not counting Nan
nie'* three little turnovers I think that
will do for the holidays this year, though
Brother John 1* coming with thoae ten
boy , and one mt i e ^ri. How cold it Is.
There le surely a storm brewing, and I
hope the folks will get here before It
breaks.'
The good woman turned the key In
the lock, and a door blowing open just
at that moment, at th* other end of the
paeageway, she hurried off to close it
and forgot about th* kay.
By 3 o'clock madame was robed In
her pretty gray poplin with white ker
chief crossed on her breast, and a dainty
whit* lac* cap on her brown curie.
which would stray out from beneath the
ca » band, and which Papa Yarrow aiyly

where sat hla wife and Httie daughter in
front of th* biasing wood fir*.

Farmer Xarrow put tb , utu . >lrl
doWB , glanced at hla wife, who, with
drooping face, did not respond to hla
merry speech.
Her husband,-noticing this, bent-over
her tenderly, with th* words, "Ye*, my
wife, our life has ben one of great hap
P ,ne «*> marred only by onejsorrow. If
he—our eldest child—our Henry—were
alive to-day, he would be a brave lad
of 17."
"John," for the first time his wife
raised her head and looked into hie face,
her brown eyes filled with tears, "John,
sometimes, methlnks our boy may yet
be alive. In the fight with the Indians,
we were told that he wai carried away
by them, and even though th* country
about waa searched by écouté and others,
It might be that they saved his life, for
he was but a baby—5 years old, and if
there was a woman in that tribe surely
she would have mother-heart enough to
preserve the life of an inocent babe who
had never done harm to any."
"Wife, wife, this is very wrong for
you to hope för the return of one who
has been so many years from us. I am
sure that our son cannot be alive, or we
would have heard of him In some way.
Ah! I hear sleigh bells."
Catching Nannie np again, he turned
toward the window, and coming up the
driveway were seen three immense
sledges drawn by strong horses and filled
with merry faces, the owners of which
were soon clambering out. The front
door was thrown open, and Madame
Yarrow's tears vanished in the hearty
handshakings and embraces of sisters,
cousins and aunts.
Even Great-grandmother Hartwell
had come, for this year It was Mary
Yarrow's Christmas feast, and all had
come to make the old honse ring with
joy and laughter until after New Year.
That night a merry crowd sat down at
the supper table. There was Brother
John Hartwell, hie wife and eleven chil
dren. There was Great-grandmother
Hartwell and her daughter-in-law,
Grandmother Hartwell. Mr. Yarrow's
father and mother were present, as were
also his two brothers and one sister with
their wives, husband and children. In
all there were thirty-three.
One might well wonder where all this
goodly company were to sleep, but if you
had gone into the great garret you would
have ceased wondering, when you saw
the trundle beds for the little ones. Of
course, the very smallest babies slept in
their mothers' rooms.
Christmas Eve the children were al
ways allowed an extra half hour around
the fireside to listen to the stories of
their elders, while the corn popped and
chestnuts burned black, or else hopped
across the floor.
On this evening Nannie sat in her
favorite place on Cousin Roderick's knee.
Uncle Tom had Just been saying that a
few daya previous he had heard that
the Indiana had been causing trouble
for the farmers. They were stealing
th* hoarded corn and wheat, and In one
Instance, after taking the grain, they
had set fir* to the granary.
Cousin Rod sa w the - look of terror In
th* eyes of some of the little ones, and
Interrupted with the words, "Well, now,
Aunt Mary, wouldn't It be a great joke

Late that night no one heard the
| "pit-pat of tiny bare feet along the
dark, cold hall, as a little white figure
j emerged from the attic, and flew down
I stairs in the moonlight, which flooded
tae houee wita lts kindiy ray,
1 wwat directly to the storeroom,
At y,, Mm , instant a tall, dark form,
' (hat had bat a moment before climbed
Into an unfastened window, stood trans
fixed with .fear at tha figure before him,
but for the moment only, when, with a
sort of grunt, the man moved toward
the pantry door.
Nannie, beneath her breath, whispered,
"It'a a Indian, an* he's come for my
turnovers Cousin Rod said he might"
She was frightened and stood very still
while the other fumbled with the lock,
which soon yielded, and when Nannie
saw the man was really hiside the pan
try, she turned and almost flew back to
her father's room, where, standing on
tiptoe, she whispered in his ear, "Fath
_ _____________________ ' .....
er! Father! A Indian it down in "the '
of
In
■toreroom, stealin' my turnovers! Com*
quick, father!
He did "go quick," and arrived just In
time to close the door of the storeroom,
and turn the key in its look.
There was a pause, then a pounding
on the door. Hastily pushing a heavy
table against it, Mr. Yarrow returned
to hla room; dressed, and calling two
other male members of tie household,
they all marched to the storeroom well
armed, and without much trouble, soon
overpowered the thief, who proved to
be an Indian, and who mumbled some
thing that sounded like broken English.
They carried him out to the smoke
house, which was built of stone, and
had a heavy iron door. The three men
watched nearby the rest of the night.
At breakfast on this Christmas morn
ing, Father Yarrow told the story of th*
previous night, and Nannie had her full
share of caresses and praise from aunt
ies, uncles and cousins alike.
Then there was a clamor from th#
youngsters to "see the prisoner;" so after
breakfast they all went forth to the tem
porary jail, Dame Yarrow among th*
others.
The great doors were pushed back,
and lying on the floor was the Indian,
asleep. But was It an Indian? Instead
of the straight black hair, his was brown
and curly.
Dam* Yarrow gave one look, then
turned to her hueband, with extended
hands, and the cry, "Oh, John, It la hel"
fell fainting Into hie arma.
The lad was awakened and taken to
th# house. He spoke English brokenly,
but could give no account of his former
Ufe, before he became one of a tribe of
half-friendly Indians.
He explained his being In the store
room by telling his hearer# that hta
tribe of Indians that was encamped sev
eral mil** above, on the river bank, ha<
been living on what they could steal from
the whites.
He had ben sent out on this night,
end seeing a window open In the back
of th* Yarrow homestead he determined
to crawl in and view the premises.
Mrs. Yarrow knelt before him and
gazing searchingly into his eyes, which
were blue, asked over and over, "Don't
you know me, Harry, darling? I am
your mother." But be could not be
made to understand. He begged leave
to return to the tribe, saying he would
^efluawback again- with -Information.
This the men were Inclined to believe
a trick to get away, but when Mrs. Yar
row pleaded for him they let him go.
All idea of church-going was aban
doned, for the first time on Christmas
Day in the life of any member in that
household, and dinner awaited at th*
bidding of madame until the return of
the youth. He was seen coming up the
walk at 3 o'clock in the afternoon, and
with him was an old Indian.
The following tale they all listened
to with great interest:
"In the great Indian fight of twelve
years before, the little captured boy was
taken to the Indian encampment, and
given to the care of a young squaw, th*
favorite wife of the chief of the tribe.
"One day ehe overheard the chiefs
talking about the white man'e child.
They said he had brought misfortune
to the Indians, as they had lost several
battlea since he had been with them, so
they had decided that the innocent child
should die.
"The squaw had learned to love th*
little one. That night ahe arose, and
taking him in her strong arms she car
ried him away to another tribe of In
dians, who were bitter enemies of her
own, and, In order to save the boy's
life, she told the chief of a deep-laid
scheme that her tribe had planned for
attacking them.
"She asked them to take the child and
keep him, till perhaps, some day he
would be restored to his "white tribe.' "
The old Indian was well rewarded
with a load of wheat and corn to carry
borne on a hand sled.
Then the long-lost Harry Yarrow was
made to understand that this was hi*
home, and that he was to remain there.
The Christmas dinner did not suffer
that night for want of attention, but
before they partook of it. Farmer Yar
row, with his arm about his son, thank
ed God for this greatest of all His bless
ings.—Home Monthly.

Disorder attending the presidential

' People to a consideration of the power
of the United States to prevent a re

that prevailed in the Island during the
last years ef Spanish rule. It is re
called that this country interfered In

the base for filibustering ep'sftations.
Cuba was occupied by American
troops, and Congress ordered that they
should not withdraw till a government
had been established under a constitu
tion which should give to the United
States the right to "Intervene lor the
maintenance of a government ade
quate for the protection of life, prop
erty and Individual liberty." The Cu
ban constitution gives this right to the
United States, and It is still further
secured by a treaty duly ratified and
proclaimed. The certainty that this
government would Intervene In case i-f
grave and widespread disorder ha.i
had a salutary effect on the Cuban
politicians trained In the methods of
the old revolutionists. If they succeed
In holding themselves In cheqk during !
the political canvass which closes with ;
the presidential election on Dec. 1 they 1
will have advanced far In the arts of !
self-government. But, says the Youth's
Companion, If the United States le

the annoyances caused by a disorderly
neighbor, the Cubans will have enly
themselves to blamo for the outcome:.
The President'* forthcoming message
Is a matter of concern to those inter
ests that have reason to believe they
will be dealt with. Among those who
show greatest concern are the railroad
corporations of the country, because ef
the President's known attitude toward
rates anC .abates. Already these cor
porations have begun to assemble e
strong lobby. Among other Interested
partie* are the great trusts ef the
country whose concern extends In tw*
directions: First, toward the Presi
dent's enforcement of existing law;
and second, toward his possible recom
mendation of tariff revision. The pre
lected Interests, alarmed by the stand
taken by the Massachusetts Republi
cans, fear that recommendations will
be made which will bring up the whole
tariff question. Then there are the in
surance companies, which fear some
suggestion of Federal regulation and
control. Other Interests may be cited
as being extremely anxious regarding
the President's forthcoming message,
but these are the more important
One reason why all such interests are
more anxious than they would other
wise be Is because President Roosevelt
has no further political ambitions.
This idea regarding the matters above
cited leads to the conclusion that
whatever recommendations are made
m his forthcoming message will look
*0 radical legislation; that Is, radical

Painstaking and Conscient!©**.
On April 7 the coffin was opened In
presence of Colonel Blanchard, M.
Weiss, M. Genlnet, superintendent of
the work, the foreman, several work
men, and myself. The lid was so firm
ly soldered that it wai removed with
rome difficulty. There was a Strong
alcoholic odor, but the, ajcohol in
which the body , had evidently been
preserved had nearly 1 all evaporated,
doubtless through the hole made In the
Hd by the pick and a crack In the edge
0 f the coffin near the foot caused by
the pressure of the earth after the -
wooden coffin had rotted away. How
ever, the earth which covered these
holes was bard and black, having evi- -
dently become indurated by the action
c f the escaping alcohol, so that the
process of evaporation had doubtless
been exceedingly slow. The body waa
covered with a winding sheet and
firmly packed with hay and straw. A

upon the work had been furnished

coffin, and the winding sheet was re
moved from the head and chest, ex
posing the face. To our Intense sur

There now took place one of the

for the purpose of verifying beyond

The official and professional respon

their disinterestedness, and the fact
that their established reputations were

the labor would be faithfully and Im

APE8 AS CASHIERS,
Wie# Animals Are Now Employed to
Test Coin in Siam.
In Siam apes are now employed as
cashiers. A year or two ago much
base coin was circulated by a clique
ef coiners, and the tradesmen found
that it was a very difficult matter to
discriminate between good and bad.
money, says the Lahore (India) Trib
une.
One large store kept a pet monkey,
and one morning he was seen to take
a coin from the cashier's desk and put
it between his teeth. After biting it
for some moments he threw It on the
floor with a solemn grimace of dissat
isfaction.
The proprietor of the More then
handed the monkey another coin, and
after testing It with great deliberation
he laid It on the cashier's desk.
Apparently the creature could tell a
counterfeit coin from a good one, and
In order to ascertain whether other
monkeys had the same extraordinary
gift a couple of apes belonging to n
j 100 were given the test, with satlsfac
j tory results. From that day the ma
Jority of the business houses In Slam
have kept monkeys as cashiers, and
the gifted creatures have developed
the faculty of discrimination between
good and bad coin to such perfection
that no human being can compete with
them.
A little while ago a monkey em
ployed by a firm of clothiers died, and
bis coffin, which was of polished oak,
and conveyed to the cemetery in an
open hearse, was followed by all th*
cashier monkeys In Slam.
Ghastly Curiosities.
Guanajuato, the ruined dty of Mex
ico, which waa destroyed by a cloud
burst, furnishes one of the ghastliest
curiosities of the world. In one of the
vaults of the Pantheon are preserved
many mummlea which were dug from
the soil. They afford a curious evi
dence of the natural embalming prop
erties of the earth.
Provoking.
"Woman Juat dropped dead In the
bargain crash at the ribbon counter!"
cried the floorwalker, excitedly.
"How Inopportune!" exclaimed the
head of the firm. "Our undertaking
department won't be opened until next
Monday!"—Catholic Standard and
Times.
