WADS HAMPTON ON MR. BAYUBD'S LEGAL TEN- I
DBU RESOLUTION.
Be as tor Wade Hampton Maya that be not only approves
of Senator Bayard's resolution for the repeal
of. the legal tender clause aa right, timely and necessary,
bat that he think* it offera a very great opportunity
to the democratlo party to perform an important
aervico to the country, and in doing
so to eatahllah a thoroughly democratic principle
He adda the democratic South ought ?*pecially
to rally to tho support of Mr. Bayard's resolution,
because it opens the way for them to effectually allay
the suspicions of the Nortli against tho South. He
beli***0Lthat Northern capital has become alarmed
leot the South, if the democratic pacty should
oome f&to power, should Insist on a huge
tnlatton and watering of the currency as
a means of scaling and to a great extent
repudiating war debts and private debts, and
that the Bayard resolution, if it had no other importance,
would be a measure of great political moAniit,
because ainoere and zealous Southern support
?f it and its passage by Southern votes would allay
ill these Northern suspicions. He hopes, therefore,
' hat the Southern Senators and members will
?e found supporting the reaolution. He added
co the gentleman who with his permission
reports this conversation that the Western
wing of tho democratlo party had given
Inflation and their other crude financial notions a
full trial, and had only brought defeat on them
eLvea. He thought it not disrespectful or unjust to
th^m to now uk them to support difleront policy,
one that had In It the elements of success for which
they could vote Without violating any democratic
principles. Ho evidently bolieves that the South
ought to remember the fall defeats in the West and
make its allianoe with the East.

THE INDIANA CONGRESSIONAL DELEGATION?
CONTEST FOR MB. ORTH'8 SEAT AT AN END?
THE PRESIDENTIAL, QUESTION.
Mr. MoCabe, who was expected to vigorously contest
the seat ot Mr. Orth ir the House, the latter
baving leu than one hundred majority, has, in the
opinion of the House Committee on Eleotions, forfeited
all claims to a further extension of time, and
tt is understood that the committee will report
asking to be discharged from the further
consideration of the case. Thia ia the caao
whtah H.jcm Mid wm to bo decided in favor of
IfcCabe in order to change tho political complexion
Of the Indiana delegation in the House. At present
it stands six democrats, six republicans and one
greenbacker. Tbe Importance o? tbe change might
Ue in the event that the Presidential election should
devq^re upon the House, when Mr. De La Matyr
would have it in his power to tie tho State by
voting with the democrats or give the casting vote
which would enable tbo republicans to elect their
candidate, as there is no probability of a third party
carrying the vote of any State. The necessity for
guarding against such a contingency has been settled,
so the hard money democrata say. by the fall
lections, and Mr. De La Matyr will be allowed to
hold the balanoe of power the remainder of the session.
tMDOCLIKO AMD CIVIL SERVICE BEFOBM IN THE

Tbe report that has reached tho Treasury Department
to the effect that there is a good deal of smuggling
along tbe Atlantic and Gulf coast has warranted
the.Secretary or tbo Treasury in despatching
special agents to investigate the truth of the statement.
It is said that tbe ngenta will also look after
the preferences of federal officials in Southern States
for Presidential nominees, and that the civil service
rules will bo enforced strictly to prevent any officeholder
from taking an active part in the selection of
delegates to tbe National Convention.

THE CONFEDERATE INVASION OF PENNSYLVANIA?SUFFERERS
BEKKINO INDEMNITY FROM
THE GOVERNMENT?BAD OUTLOOK FOB WAR
CLAIMS.
The effort which was made In every Congress since
1868 bv citizens of tbe border'countie* of Pennsylvania
to securo payment for property destroyed by
the Confederate invasion of 1HA3 is to b? repeated in
this Cousrcss. The papers bare already been withdrawn
from the files to be re-referred. AU this
would seem to be labor spent In vain, as Congress
has repeatodly declared that those claims are not of
t class which lmposo any liability upon the government.
These claims havo never been regarded as
more meritorious than tho claim of Dr. Best, of
Kentucky, and tho bill for his relief was vetoed. In
the Forty-third Congress Judge Lawrence, of Ohio,
then chairman of the Committee on War Claims,
submitted an elaborate report taking strong grounds
against those and kindred claims, and his conclusions
were indorsed and actod upon by the committee
in tho Forty-fourth an<l Forty-fifth Cougresses.
As this Congress will try to niako a big record for
oconomy, In view of tho coming Presidential contest,
people who expect to be benefited by pushing
war elaims may mako up thoir minds that they will
have but a sorry ihance.

GENERAL WASHINGTON DESPATCHES.
Washington, Dec. 8, 1879.
SENATOB VOORHEES* FINANCIAL RESOLUTION?
REVIVAL OP PROSPERITY EXPLAINED?SILVER
AND GREENBACKS DID IT.
Senator Voorhees introduced the following preamble
and resolution in the Senate to-day, and it
was ordered printed and laid on the table, to be
called up by its author:?
Whereas the restoration of ailver money to the
lawful currency o( the country by aot of Congress of
February 28, 1878, wua demanded with singular
unanimity by the American people and is now sustained
by the public interests and by the full force
of an intelligent public opinion; and whereas by the
act of May 31,1878, the circillation of the Uuitad
States legal teuder notes, commonly known as greenbacks,
was fixed at the amount then in existence, to
wit, $346,000,000, and the Secretary of the Treasury
was prohibited from reducing it below that amount
by any prooess or upon any pretext whatever;
and whereas the aforesaid United States legal
tender note or greenback circulation having been
accepted by the government for customs duties, became
at once and is now equal in value to gold and,
in certain transactions, at a premium over both the
previona metaU, anil whereas these financial measures,
forced upon the present administration and
adopted by Congress over its most strenuous opposition.
have restored the confidence of the business
world In ths character, the amount and the stability
of the mosey of this country, thereby creating a
general revival of trade and of business prosperity;
therefor* be it
Resolved, Tbat the Senate has heard with profound
astonishment and deep regret the proposition
of the President of the United States in his recent
annual message, and of t&e Secretary of the Treasury,
to 1 inaugurate a new and uncalled for financial
agitation with a view to the destruction of the most
necessary currencies now in use in the hands of the
people.
Kesolvwd, As ths sense of the Senate, that such an
agitation Is detrimental to the public interests, calculated
to unsettle all values, confuse and disturb business,
shake public and private confidence, and that it
calls for immediate and unqualified condemnation.
Beaolved, Tbat the true interests of the country
require the tree and unlimited coinage of both gold
ana silver on conditions of exact equality, and that
it is the part of a wise financial policy to maintain
the United States legal tender circulation, commonly
known as greenbacks, in volume not less than now
exists, and to preserve its legal tender quality unrestricted
as to amount and unimpaired in legal effect.
THE DEATH O* BEPBE8ENTATIVE LAX?RESOLUTIONS

the State of Missouri in the Forty-sixth Congress,
That in the untimely death of their colleague, the
Hon. A. M. Lay, they hare lost an amiable and respected
friend and coadj utor, his State a talented
and faithful representative, his family a twlovod and
loving husband and fathor; that they offer to bis
afflicted family the most sincere and heartfelt sympathy
In the unexpected bereavement which thus
deprives them of their guardian and protector.
Resolved, That n copy of these resolutions be presented
to the family of th? departed and that the
same be published in the public press.
THE BRIDGE ACROSS THE DETROIT RIVER?RE*
PORT OK THE BOARD OF ENGINEERS.
The Secretary of War transmitted to the Senate today
the report of a board of engineer officers, made
in compliance with requirements of tho Joint reso*
lutlon of June SO, 1870, "Relating to a bridge across
the Detroit River at Detroit, Mich." Tho Board is
nnanlmoosly of tho opinion that the most
complete solution of the problem is the construction
of a tuunel under the Detroit
River. They, however. Indorse the bridge
plan conditionally, concluding that thero will be no
material dUfcui .y in Teasels passing through drawa
of 300 or 400 feet in width at any time when it would
be safe to navigate the river and that if the right of
way is clearly and emphatically given to navigation
there would be no material or undue injury to that
interest.
The Board in their report mention the fact that
they were directed by Oeueral Shermau to inquire
into and report whether for railroad purposes the
Detroit River can be bridged or tunnelled at Detroit
or within one mile above or below
said city in such manner as to accommo
date the large trade and commerce crossing
tho river at that point and without material injury
to thernavigation of said river, a good and sufficient
tug being always kept by the bridge owners to assist
| any craft when required. They convened at Detroit
on the first Thursday of October. 1879, aud
were required by General Sherman to complete
and aubmit their report and rooomuiendations
to the chief of ssgineers before De.
cumber X. The first five daya of the
session were occupied in hearing statements
and arguments of persons favoring or opposing the
construction of a bridge or tunnel, and then, at the
urgent request of all parties* Interested, the Board
adjourned to enable them to collect atatiatica boarlug
upon the subject. On the 18th of Movember
they reassembled and prooeeded to consider matters
referred to them.
The difficulty that they met with at the atart la
thus briefly stated:?
At Detroit two Immense streams of commerce
coino into direct interference?namely, one by water
aud the other by rallroada. The problem before the
Board wis to so arraugo by either bridge or tunnel
that these might cross each other with the least injury
to both, and in such manner as to accommodate
the railroad traffic, and at the aamo tliuaido no
material or undue Injury to tbo interests of navigation.
Tho magnitude of these conflicting interests
at this point may be realised trom the official statements
marked in the report, which show that the
number of vessels of various kinds passing Fort
Gratiot lighthouao during the fiscal year endiug
Amu 30. 1879, was 22.1C0, and that the business of
the railroads crossing the river at Detroit during
the year 1878 was as follows: ?129,113 passeUKers,
1U.258 passenger cars, 3,873 baggage cars and 104,359
freight cars.
The question of bridging or tunnelling the Detroit
lUver had been agitated for several years and numerous
plans and projects therefor hsd been presented
for consideration; but, as the joint rosolu.
tlnn contained no instructions to the Board to consider
modes, plans of construction, details of operation
or the matter of cost, thes?rsubjects, except in
a general way, are not refer rod to In tho report.
The report of a board of engineers appointed in
1873 to investigate this aame subject is alluded to.
This former Board stated, among other things, that
.a Ksl.l.to uri?l? .KamIiI I
Iloard of 1879, in their coocltuion* on this point,
say:?
There is probably no difference of opinion about
these conclusions exiu.pt us to tbe one reterring to a
briilKe with draws. The form of b rid so considered
lnadmiHxiblo by the former Hoard had openings of
ICC feet on each aide, the remainder to be built upon
piers of masonry MM) feet apart,' and 'it la believed
that draw openings of IMS feet were the greatest
then considered practicable. Draws of more tban
200 feet have been aliioe conatructe?l, and It ia now
proposed by bridge buildera of high reputation to
construct them with openlnga of :HX) loet on each
aide of a pivot pier, or o( 400 feet between two pivot
piers.
With reference to the traffic across the proposed
river bridge, the Hoard finds that with the preaont
trafllo there will be ampls tirno during the Intervals
between the passage of vessels to move all tralna
across the bridge, l'heru will occasionally bo delays,
but the railroads can aocommodate their time
tables to coinponaata for any ordinary delays. They
say, however, that In case authority to construct a
bridge aliouId bo granted by Cougress It should be
distinctly provided that vessels have tho right of
way except when moving tralua are passing over the
bridge.
The Hoard, although unanimously of opinion that
'atnuuel offer* the moat complete solution of tho
problem, presents no argument In favor of It.
THE FLORIDA CENTRAL IIAILROAD CAHE?PACTS
REGARDING TUB ALLEGED FRAUDULENT SUPKUSKOiAN
BONDS?ARGUMENT BEFORE THE
UNITED BTATHJ HUI'REME COURT.
The case of the Florida Central Railroad Company,
appellants, versus J. Frederick Hchutto et al. canto
up 1b the United Htates Supreme Court thia afternoon,
on a motion ot the appellees to discharge the
vfder of supersedeas recent!/ granted by Justiee
V.? *; - ,
K. HERALD. TUESDAY, _E
Bradloy, and Ob another motion of the appellanta
to have a new bond substituted for the oue previously
offered and a new order of auperaedeas granted. The j
caae attracted more than usual attention on account
of the reputation and standing of some of the
partiea to the auit and the damaging nature of tho j
charges uiade against them iu connection with tho
ailtfeed fraudulent character of the aupcrsedoaa ;
bonds accepted by Justice Bradley laat July. The .
cane, aa stated by counael 'for tho appclleea, is :
briuily aa follows:?
A decree directing the sale of the Florida Central
Railroad was entered by Justico Bradley at. Jacksonville,
Flo.. May lil, 1?7'J. From that decreo an appeal
waa taken iu the nania of the company. The
amount ot the bond waa Used at $100,(XX)
and a bond for this sum was subsequently executed
in Naw York city by Ave portions, all purporting to
be men of property. The bond waa delivered to
Justice Bradley by Mr. L. Eagle, the president of the
railroad company, and waa approved by him as a
supersedeas of the decree he haa made. This bond,
it is alleged by counsel for the appellees, was worthless
and fraudulent; the aecuritioa upon it were
profesaional straw bondsmen, and their affidavits
as to property owned by them were shter
perjuries. One of them, it ia asserted, waa under
indictment for forging powers of attorneyto collect
interest upon registered bonds, one was in jail for
debt, and unaat>stted judgments were sought for
aiuali.amounta against several ot the others. Tha
persons charged with complicity in the procurement
of thla fraudulent bond are Mr. L. Fugle,
of the Florida Central Railroad Company; L. P.
Bayne, a prominent banker aud broker, of No. W
Broad street, Mew York; William J. Cromwell, of
the law firm of Sullivan k Cromwell, and Wesley
Lyon, au attorney, ot So. 0 Beukmau street. Mr.
Lyon, who waa directly employed by Mr. Cromwell
in procuring the sureties on the bond, is charged in
one of the affidavits submitted by counsel of the
appellees with being "by common repute a notorious
swindler, professionally engaged in the our<
iiunh ui iuucuriun LuiBO uiiu iiiiimumiib uuuuo,
and at one tlino an inmate of the Tomb*
on a charge of grand larceny." Th? sureties. It is alleged,
received from Lyon in payment for their services
as bondsmen sums ranging from $1(* to #125.
Upon this statement of the case, supported by many
affidavits, counsel for the appellees asked that the
supersedeas bond be vacated ou account of fraud, and
that the motion or the appellant for the substitution
of a new bond and the granting of a
new order of supers odaes be denied, since
to grant it would be to offer a premium
upon this kind of dishonesty. Counsel for the appellant
waivod discussion as to the sufficiency of the
supersedeas bond. They deny, however, that Messrs.
Baynq, L. Engle and Cromwell inteuded to procure a
lraudulent bond, or had any knowledge of its fraudulent
character, and, in support of this denial, submit
depositions of the three gentlemen accused,
together with affidavits from the Governor of Flotida,
the Chief Justlco and several Asxociote Justices
and the Attorney General of that State, testifying
to Mr. L. Bugle's integrity; also affidavits
to show that tho statements of Hunt, Egan
and Williams as to the complicity of Messrs.
L. Engle. Buyne and Cromwell in the alleged frauds
were raise and prejured and were sold to the appellees.
Finally the counsel for the railroad company,
although admitting the insufficiency of the
security at the time the bond was executed, assert
that ther% is no evidence to show that Mr. L. Engle,
the President of tho railroad company, was cognizant
of it, and that if the supersedeas bonds be vacated
the appellants should be allowed as a matter
of justice to substitute a new one. Wayne McVeagh
and M. H. Carpenter argued the case for the appellees,
and P. Phillips and William A. Maury for the
appellants.

SEVERE WINTER SETTING IN.
[From the Alta California. Nov. 27.]
Some excitement was caused last evening by the
announcement of ttoe arrival in port of the whaling
bark Ueien Mar, Captain Uanldry, bringing with her
the crow of the Mercury, which vessel has also
beeu for some tiiao expected. Wlien it was known
that a whaler was outside all were in hopes that it
was the Mount Woilaston, which vessel rumor
stated had spokon with tho Joaunotte. An Alta reporter
was immediately despatched to make inquirioa,
and the result may bq stated as follows:?
Tho Helen Mar arrived about six o'clock, seventeen
days from Pox Island and about thirty-ono days
irom the Arctic. Her passengers were Captain
Stephen Hlckruan. wife and daughter, and the crow
of the bark Mercury, which was abandoned in the
ice on October H. in latitude 71 deg. 10 min. north,
longitude 17'J degrees west, or just north of tho
Herald Shoals.
The Mercury became ice bound on Tuesday, the
21st of October. At this tiiuo the llelun Mar was
nearly halt a mile distant in a similar tlx. As it was
thought that tbey would nave to wiutijr together
tho provisions of the Mercury were translurred to
the other ship, tho ice being thick enough to support
teams aud wagons and the weather sufficiently ealm
for such au operation. Fortune, however, favored
the Helou Mar, tor on the '24th a ualo sprang up, aud
tho ice partod, carrying her out into opou water, while
the other vessel remained fast. The crew of the
Mercury had hard work in Joining their consort.
Neither of the vessels had seen or beard news of
the Jesnuette, but on tho 11th the Helen Mar saw tho
Vigilant steering north, and it is thought tho latter
venael may have met the gallant explorer. On the
4lb of October tho Woilaston had not seen Captain He

ot regret that such a division should exist, but the

It, of course, as a pivotal State, tor if they can csirry

however, that if Thurman wants to be a candidate

success, ho would have the support of Ohio zuora

The reporter then asked tue ex-Cougrossman what

"It dou't amount to a row of pins," he replied
emphatically. "If you want my deliberate opinion,
it is all a humbug. It has been a humbug
umler Hayes and will be under any
other President. The difficulty has arisen
from the very nature of tho government. There aa
the necessity of the party in power rewarding thoa*
who assisted it to get into power. When you talk
about examining men like a lot of schoolboys In
geography and arithmetic and keeping then lu office
for life independent of their politics it is ridiculous.
No iidminlsiration has ever dono it, and no adnilatration

HEP U liLICAN PRIMARIES.
The republican primaries for the selection of delegates
to the Central Committee of the organisation
for IStiO will be held to-night in the various Assent*
bly districts in this city. Unusual interest is felt by
politicians in tlieao elections because or the
orgauii.d opposition that haa beeu formed ia
boii^j of tho districts against what la termed
the "Arthur machine." Colonel George Bliss in 111*
recent communications to Ooneral Arthur sought to
ahow the "evils" of the present republican primary
system, aud it is claimed by those who are lighting
the "machine" that the truth of the Colouel'a statements
will bo shown by to-night's elections. It la
probable that thero will be contests in some of the
districts, more especially In the Third, Fifth, .Sixth,
Twelfth, Fifteenth, Seventeenth and Twenty-first.
In the Third district William Garry and others,
representing the Arthurics, will have to laca
an opposition faction. In the Fifth district
ex-Senator Lent aud ex Aldr rrnan Brady, warm Arthur
uien, will be opposed by James Wjnterbottoia
and others, lu thin district it is probable that twa
primaries will be held aud the matter be finally or.
guod before the Central Committee, lu this event It
ik considered likely that the "machine" men will I*
mlowed seats. There is but little opposition lu tlia
Kighth district, where Mr. John J. O'ltrien is leader.
Id the other districts the opposition to General
Arthur does not amount to mucii, except in tho case
of ihe Fifteenth, Seventeenth and Tweuty-first districts.
