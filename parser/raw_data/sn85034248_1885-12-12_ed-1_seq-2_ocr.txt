EDITon CHIEF-It is with feelings of deep
regret that we announce the death of our be.
loved friend and sister. 'larah Allison, the wife
of lIev. Robert W. Allison. who departed this
life at 8 o'clock A. M., Tuesday, October 20,
1885. The deceased had boon afflicted with a
painful illness for more than three years, and
at times seemed to recover, but for the last few
months she suffered most severely. According
to her last sayings, we believe she has made her
escape to a better world, where none but
Christians dwell.
She leaves tier husband with nine children
and miany relatives and friends to mourn her
departure, The funeral was largely attended.

Work was commenced this week upon
the new levee to be constructed at Lacroix
place, and there is a force of twenlty or
thirty white men employed which is to be
.cunsiderably increased. We wre some
what misinformed relative to the awarding
of the contract for this work. Mr. Martin
ll.:ad is not t.e.contractor,but is merely in
charge of the job as foreman or superiu
tendont for Mr. Maginty, of the firm of
Ja: mo' & MagiNut. The State Engineers
have deemed it advisable to extend the
new levee several hundred feet further
below the caving batture than was at first
.contemplated, giving the embankment a
total length of 1750 feet, including the two
wings connecting it with the old levee,
which cover about 130 feet of the dis
tance mentioned. We understand that
Mr. Head expects to complete the work
during the latter part of January or the
beginning of February. The old levee is
still intact, and in all probability will re
main so dring the coming high water
seasoin.

RECOVERING A BATTLE FLAG.
The interesting fact has recently come
to light that the flag of the Second Louis
iana Cavalry, C. S. A., which was captured
from that famous regiment in the Trans
Mississippi Department during the civil
war, is in the possession of an ex-Union
soldier residing at Dana, Green county,
Iowa.
Among the surviving officers of the Sec
ond Louisiana, a friend recalls Colonel W.
G. Vincent, the well known auctioneer,
New Orleans; Adjutant R. N. Sims, attor
ney-at-law, Donaldsonville; Capt. Hiram
H. Carver, attorney-at-law, Napoleonville;
Capt. Allen Jumel, State Senator, Iberville;
Lieut. Alex. Hebert, District Attorney,
Iberville; Capt. M. Kenison, commanding
steamer Warren ; Lieut. D. Webster Kelly,
Grosse Tpte; Major W. W. Brazeale,
Natchitoches; Capt. E. T. Lewis, ex-Con
gressmpn, Opelousas; Capt. Dave Paul,
Sheriff of Rapides parish; Capt. Jeff.
Stafford, Alexandria; Capt. Gallion,
Natchitoches ; Capt. W. F. Strong, ex
Secretary of State; Capt. L. D. Prescott,
newly appointed Postmaster at Washing
ton, St. Landry parish.
Measures have been taken by the gallant
Colonel of the regiment to secure the re
turn of its beloved colors, and all the old
soldiers who marched under the war-worn
banner will await its recovery with impa
tient intgrest.
EXECUTiVE GLEMENCY AND THE
INCREASE OF CRIME.
An examination of the official records in
the office of the Secretary of State has been
made by the Baton Rouge Cupitolian -Ad
vocate with a view to ascertaining whether
there is any just foundation for the charge
that Gov. McEnery has contributed to the
increase of crime by showing extraordinary
and undue clemency towards convicted
criminals. Our contemporary reports, as a
result of this inquiry, that the number of
convictions for criminal offenses under the
McEnery Administration is double that at
tained during the administration of Gov
ernor Nicholls, whereas the percentage of
commutations has been reduced by Gover
nor McEnery from 28 to 20%. While the
CHIEF confesses to a decided predilection
against the present State Administration
and this without regard to its political com
plexion-we have not preferred or indorsed
the accusation which seems to have been so
successfully refuted by our esteemed Baton
Rouge contemporary. Under existing laws
it would be manifestly unjust to blame the
Governor alone for commutations of crim
inal sentences, since he can not exercise the
executive prerogative in such cases until a
majority of the Board of Pardons-which
consists of the Lieutenant Governor, Attor
ney General and the Judge who presided at
the trial of the condemned-shall have rec
ommended such action; and it is reasona
ble to presume that a body so constituted
would not advise interference with the ver
dict of a jury without weighty reason. A
Governor who declines to acquiesce in the
unanimous recommendation of the Board
of Pardons-and its conclusions are nearly
always unanimous-would undoubtedly be
oftener wrong than right, and much more
likely to consig. a defenseless fellow crea
ture to unmerited punishment than to in
flict an injustice upon society by heeding
the Board's advice.
Though the records cited by the Capilo
lian-Advocate effectually shield the Govern
or from the charge of indiscriminate or un
usual clemency, they apparently bear out
the allegation that crime has increased un
der his administration. If the " number of
convictions for criminal offenses, as com
pared with Governor Nicholls' administra
tion, has been doubled," the presumption
arises that the number of criminal offenses
has increased in corresponding ratio. To
successfully combat this presumption it
will be necessary to show that juries, Judges
and other officers of the law were much
more lax in the discharge of their duties
during the term of the Nicholls administra
tion than has been the case under the Mc
Enery regime. We scarcely believe that a
task of this kind will be so much as at
tempted.

PROCEEDINGS OF CONGRESS.
The National Congress assembled in
regular session, at Washington, last Mon
day, with nearly all the members in attend
ance. The Senate organized by electing
Hon. John Sherman, of Ohio, nominee of
the Republican caucus, as its presiding offi
cer, the vote standing 34 for Sherman
against 29 for Senator Harris, of Tennes
see, nominee of the Democratic caucus.
Senator Sherman's remarks in -assuming
the chair were very brief, and included a
touching allusion ,to the death of Vice
President Hendricks. As soon as intelli
gence of the organization of the House had
been received and a joint committee ap
pointed to notify the President, resolu
tions relating to the demise of the late
Vice President were adopted, and the Sen
ate adjourned in respect to his memory.
On Tuesday the President's message was
received and read. and since then the Sen
ate has been engaged in discussing Sena
tor Hoar's presidential succession bill and
the transaction of ordinary business.
There will be little change in the forma
tion of committees or subordinate officers
of the Senate.
In the House of Representatives I-on.
John G. Carlisle, of Kentucky, was re
elected Speaker, receiving 177 votes,
against 138 for Hon. Thoe. B. Reed, of
Maine. On assuming the chair, Mr. Car
lisle addressed the House as follows :
Gentlemen of the House of Representa
tives-In assuming the duties and respon
sibilities of this place for a second time, I
beg to return my most profound thanks
for the manifestation of your continued
confidence. It is a compliment which I
shall always remember with pride and
gratitude.
Nowhere else in the world can there be
found a legislative assembly representing
so great a constituency as that represented
by this House, and certainly no similar
body, consisting of an equal number of
members, is its superior in point of ability
and devotion to the interests entrusted
to it.
The privilege of presiding over the do
liberations of such a body is a very high
and honorable distinction, the highest and
most honorable it can confer on any of its
members, and Iappreciate it as such, but,
gentlemen, my full appreciation of your
action to-day can best be shown by a con
scientious and impartial discharge of my of
ficial duty, and although it may not be wise
to make pledges in advance, I venture to
promise that to the fullest extent of my
ability the law governing the proceeding of
the House shall be evenly administered,
with a view to the preservation of order
and decorum, the protection of the person
al and representatives rights of members
and the prompt transaction of public
business. None of these results, however.
can be obtained withouf your active co
operation and support.
In a body so large as this, representing
such vast and sometimes conflicting inter
ests, a constant observance of established
rules and precedents is imperatively re
quired, not only by considerations vitally
affecting the public welfare, but in order
to maintain the honor and dignity of the
House itself. In the sharp contests for
priority which unavoidably occur in such a
body the restraints imposed by the fixed
rules are sometimes quite severely tested,
especially if there has been a large accu
mulation of business, but experience has
shown that the necessity for order and
regularity in the consideration of leiisla
tive measures is so fully appreciated by
gentlemen on the floor that they can al
ways be relied upon to maintain the pre
siding officer in every proper effort he may
make to obtain that result.
In view of this fact I feel much more
confident of a reasonable degree of success
in this trying position than would other
wise be justifiable.
Questions of order must be decided
promptly, as they are raised, generally
without much opportunity for deliberation
and consequently whoever may occupy the
chair and however careful he may be, mis
takes must frequently be committed, but,
fortunately, this house has, at all times, in
its own hands the power to correct them
and preserve the integrity and consistency
of its practice, and I am sure, gentlemen,
that you will not hesitate to exercise that
power whenever the occasion may de
mand.
Gentlemen, we are about to enter upon
the work of an important session. More
important perhaps than any that has tre
ceded it for many years. The political re
lations heretofore existing between the two
bodies of the House and the Executive De
partment of the Government have been re
versed and this, of itself, imposes new ob
ligations and duties on both.
Under a popular form of Government
like ours a political change in the executive
neccessarily involves altered methods of
administration, inaugurates a new legisla
tive policy,and consequently presents new
questions for the consideration of the
people and their representatives. It is
probable therefore, that many questions
not heretofore prominent in nor delibera
tions will engage a large share of your at
tention during the present Congress. It
may be reasonably anticipated also, that
wide differences of opinion will exist on
many of these questions, resulting in long,
earnest at d perhaps exciting contests on
the floor and it may be that these differ
ences will not always he defined by recog
nized party lines. Under these circum
stances, a proper appreciation of the integ
rity and patriotism of each other, a sin
cere respect for the honest opinions of op
ponents in debate and the cultivation of a
mutual forbearance will be neccessary to
enable the House to conduct its precec dings
with order and deliberation and avoid
unpleasant incicents. which are always, in
my experiencnat least, most seriously re
gretted by those who participate in them.
The house is the only custodian of its own
peace and dignity, and without its cordial
support no presiding officer can preserve
either.
And now, gentlemen, before taking the
oath of office, allow me to renew the ex
pressions of my sincere acknowledgment
of the great honor you have conferred and
the great trust you have confided to my
hands. I accept both with a proper sense
of the obligations they impose and certainly
with the earnest desire to discharge these
obligations without prejudice to any public
interest.
Nearly all the former officers of the
House were re-elected; a committee ap
pointed to notify the Senate and the presi
dent of organization: the usual drawing for
seats conducted; after which resolutions
referring to the death of the Vice President
were adopted and the House adjourned until
Tuesday as a mark of respect to his mem
ory. As in the Senate the greater portion
of the second day's session was occupied in
hearing the President's message, and the
main topic of discussion since then has
been a proposed revision of the rules which
will make some highly important changes
in the manner of conducting business, par
ticularly with reference to appropriations.
