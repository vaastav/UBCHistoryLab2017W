How bad -our friends in Saline coun
ty" will feel wheii they find out that the
lands restored do not touch that county,
and how "faithfully and effectivelly"
"that promise has been redeemed." The
land restored lies West of the 100th
meridian, Saline county is East of that
meridian ; the restored tract lies South
of the south line of town five, which line
makes the southern boundary of Saline
county ! The lands granted to railroads
are usually cf those nearest to the road
bed ; the Kansas Pacific Railroad held
these lands while their survey located that
road cn the Republican Fork in Nebras
ka ; the company not Morton having
changed their route to the Smoky Hil
Fork, in Kansas, our lands had to be re
linquished and other lands near the new
route chosen !
We hope "our friends in Saline" wil
hold this mighty mole in the Democratic
dung-hill to "that promise ;" and tha
his 'hefty" influence shown in raising
the Marsh from our P. O., digging Cole
out cf the Peru office and "histing" But
ler at Pawnee city will be able to raise
the B. & M. R. R. grant, which is the
road that now holds all the vacant odd
sections in this Land District, yea, even
that of "our friends in Saline county.
The following facts on immigration to
Southern Nebraska we take from the
Nebraska City Press of the 24th :
"We enquired of Mr. Bebout. nroDrie
tor cf the ferry at this place, a few days
ago, what number of families have cross
u here to settle in Nebraska, nnd the
astonishing reply was, that for the last
four months, 'ttdios Noveraber"15th. not
less than ten families per day have cross
ed. Last evening we met Mr. W. S.
Morgan, of the ferry at Brewnvillej and
he informed us that for the same length
of time twenty families daily, at the
lowest estimate, had crossed at that place,
making a total at these two places of
three thousand six hundred and ninety
families. These families will average
five persons each, so our readers cau, by
a slight calculation see that our popula
tion has been increased, eighteen thous
and four hundred and fifty."

among circles in this country is ut white

now ready to "go to the rescue" are re

Last. week, our towusman, David Me

We learn that, on the 23d ult , Mr
Overaker in a fit of insanity set both o
his frame houe in Aspinwall on fire and
then run to the woods, since which time
as we learn, he has been once seen
Rulo and no more, although a diligen
search has been kept up. The houses
were both burned to the ground, and his
family are thus left without house or
home. The case is a deploralle one and
must secure for the family the sympathy
and assistance of community. Norause
can be given for this fit of inssnity save
the losses recently sustained by Mr
uveacker financially, over which he
seemed constantly brooding.

lives one mile below the mouth of Rock
Creek, while the family were out visiting,

of its contents, se,( fire to it, destroying

Pern Seminary Examination.
Peru, Neb , Dec. 3d, 1866.
Friend Colhapp : Allow me through
the medium of the Advertiser to give to
those who feel interested in the cause of
education, the result of the examination
at the close of the first term of the Peru
SiuiiuarY; which examination embraced
twu days, and was conducted iu the mast
thorough manner. ' . .
The advancement made by the stu
dents in their several studies excelled the
most sangui'ie expectations of their
friends, who were in attendance from
different pans cf the county, both iq the
advancement and in thorough mastering
of the rudiments of the several brunches
engaged in- In this connection I would
remark that if praise be due to either
class above the rest, that, to my mind, it
belongs to the commencing Grammer
Class; in justice, however, to ihe other
classes 1 must say that all did well.
Their examination" gave conclusive evi
dence of the efficiency of Prof. M'Ken
zie as a teacher, and the close applica
tion of the students.
The classes in Thompson's higher Ar
ithmatic, Algebra, Book-keeping, As
tronomy, and Vocal Music, all acquitted
themselves very credibly.
The exhibition, although not intended
to be anything more than the .regular
school series, was quite interesting ; both
the com position, and declaiming of select
pieces, woulil ha va done credit to school
of longer standing.
The School has labored under some
disadvantages during the past Term,
which will be obviated for the next, which
will commence on the 13:h of the present
month, in the Seminary building. This
buildio , though not completed, will be
so arranged that ihe tchool will occupy
it with comfort to all.
The list of students for the term to
commence on the 13th in?t., show3 that
(he number will b& fully up to the facili
ties for their accommodation, which num
ber will probably reach SO or 100.

Railroad Connections East.
A few days ao we had occasion to ai
lude to the St. Louis route as a good a ud
reliable line of travel for per.-ons going
East. Since then we have had occa? ion
to examine the different time laM-?s and
we find that rouie even more favorable
to the comfort and speed of travelers
than we at first anticipated. Railroad
men understand lime tables and how to
copdense them, but to the travelling pub
lic they only serve to confuse, and very
few indeed ith the time and figures bes
ide them can lell at what day or hour
they can arrive at the place they may
t.esire to reach. We will ilhmraie tii-i
St. Louis route : Supposing the time of
leaving St. Joseph is SunJay evening at
7 o'clock, via Hannibal & St. Joe and
North Missouri Railroads, you arrive iu
St. Louis Monday at 12:15, noon; you
leave at 3 p. in ; Tuesday morning at 6
o'clock you are in Cincinnati; leaving
there ou the famous 7 o'clock express
you are in "New Y:rk cny Wednesday

Leaving St. Joseph any other day at
time rueotioptd, aiid the same rule will
apply as to the. tune of arrival at. the
points above mentioned. Except when
Sunday intervenes; in that case the pas
senger would nave to lay over at Cincin
nati or Indians polic from Sunday morn
ing until evenin?.
By comparing ihe above time. pa?sen-
gers will be able at once to determine at
about what hour they can arrive at pain's
not mentioned aboe. The St. Louis
rouve has always been a favorite line wiih
our citizens, but heretofore ihe delays
and want of connections have been an
noying and painful. BjI when ihe trav
eling public learn that ihe present change
of time was made with a special viswto
the St. Louis connections, they will read-
iy see tne importance of adopting lhat
