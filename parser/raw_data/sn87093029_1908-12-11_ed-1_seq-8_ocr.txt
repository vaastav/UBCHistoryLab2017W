PRESIDENT'S
LAST MESSAGE
ANNUAL RECOMMENDATIONS TO
CONGRESS ARE MADE BY
, ROOSEVELT.
Sherman Law Should Be Amended.
Favors Postal Savings Banks
and Parcel Post.
Washington, Dec. follow
ing is a brief synopsis of the Presi
dent's message, read to the two
Houses today:
The financial standing of the na
tion at the present time is excellent,
and the financial management of the
nation's Interests by the government
during the last seven years has
shown the most satisfactory results.
But our currency system is imperfect
and it is earnestly to be'hoped that
the currency commission will b».- able
to propose a thoroughly good system
which will do away with the exist
ing defects.
During the period from July 1,
1901, to Sept. SO, 1908, there has
been a net surplus of
hundred millions of receipts over ex
penditures, a reduction the inter
est bearing debt by ninety millions,
In spite of the extraordinary expense
of the Panama canal and a saving of
nearly nine millions on the annual
Interest charge.
Corporations—l believe that un
der the interstate clause of the con
stitution the United States has com
plete and paramount right to control
all agencies of interstate commerce,
and I believe that the national gov
ernment alone can exercise this
right with wisdom and effectiveness
so as both to secure justice from and
to do justice to the great corpora
tions which are the most important
factors in modern business. I be
lieve that it is worse than folly to
attempt to prohibit all combinations
as is done by the Sherman anti-tru3t
law, because such a law can be en
forced only imperfectly and unequal
ly, and Its enforcement works almost
as much hardship as good.
The railways of the country should
be put completely under the inter
state commerce commission and re
moved from the domain of the anti
trust law.
Telegraph and telephone com
panies engaged in interstate business
should be pat under the jurisdiction
of the Interstate commerce commis
sion.
Labor—As far as possible I hope
to see a frank recognition of the
advantages conferred by machinery,
organisation and division of labor,
accompanied by an effort to bring
about a larger share in the owner
ship by wageworker of railway, mill
and factory.
There should no longer be any
paltering with the question of tak
ing care of the wageworkers who,
under our present Industrial system,
become killed, crippled or worn out
as part of the regular incidents'of
a given business. The object sought
could be achieved by proper employ
ers' liability laws.
I also renew my recommendation
that the principle of the eight-hour
day should be as rapidly and as far
as practicable be extended to the en
tire work being carried on by the
government.
The Courts—l most earnestly urge
upon congress the duty of increasing
the totally inadequate salaries now
given to our judges. Beginning with
the supreme court, the judges should
have their salaries doubled.
It"is discreditable to us as a peo
ple that there should be difficulty in
convicting murderers or in bringing
to justice men who as public ser
vants have been guilty of corruption
or who have profited by the corrup
tion of public servants.
Forests—lf there is any one duty
which more than another we owe it
to our children and our children's
children to perform at once it is to
save the forests of this country, for
they constitute the first and most im
portant element of the natural re
sources of the country.
Pure Food—The pure food legis
lation has already worked a benefit
difficult of estimation.
Postal Savings Banks—l again re
new my recomemndatlon for postal
savings banks, for depositing sav
ings with the security of the govern
ment behind them.
Parcel Post —The establishment of
a local parcel post on rural routes
would be to the mutual benefit of
the farmer and country storekeeper.
Public Health—The dangers to
public health from food adulteration
ind from many other sources, such
as the menace to the physical, men
tal and moral development of chil
dren from child labor, should be met
itnd overcome.
Statehood —I advocate the imme
diate admission of New Mexico and
Arizona as states. This should be
done at the present session of con
gress.
Porto Rico —1 again recommend
that American citizenship be con
ferred upon the people of Porto Rico.
The Navy—l approve the recom
mendations of the general board for
the increase of the navy, calling es
pecial attention to the need of addi
tional destroyers and colliers and.
above all. of the four battleships. It
u desirable to complete as soon as
U*£T wr s'T'
ihi ps of the best existing type.
HOB HMD BANK
FIVE MEN HOLD UP PRESIDES*
AND CASHIER AT DESK*J
AND SECURE $14,743.
Robbers Pnl Loot in Sacks and Mai 8
Their Escape in Two Minutes.
No Clew Is Found.
Portland, Or., Dec. 8. —Five un
masked men held up and robbed the
East Side Bank at 5:45 o'clock last
night. Fourteen thousand dollars
in gold, silver and currency was the
plunder claimed by the robbers. This
they gathered in two big sacks and
ran out of the bank, staggering un
der the weight of the loot.
Just two minutes were required to
complete a robbery that has few
precedents for desperation and dar
ing. Entering the bank, in the heart
ol the East Side business district, at
an hour when hundreds of people
were on the streets, the leader and
most determined of the five men, at
pistol's point forced President New
hall and his son, who is the cashier,
to retire, their hands up, into Mr.
Newhall's private office. This done
two men who were waiting outside
jumped inside the swinging door,
and while one stood with a cocked
revolver watching the entrance, the
other held sacks into which the lead
er dumped the money from the coun
ter and cash till. The other two re
mained as "look-outs" on the out
side. and were prepared to throw the
authorities off the scent in case they
were driven to cover or discovered
before making their get-away.
Deputy Sheriff Frank Beatty found
a package of the stolen money—-
$200 In $5 gold piece—which the
robbers had dropped in their flight.
The leading spirit in the robbery,
a man of 38, smooth shaved and
wearing seedy clothes, took all the
desperate chances and did the actual
work of taking the money.
Detectives and police are on tha
case, but as yet have no clews.
ROOT DENIES CHARGE
Washington Bar Association to Sift
Scandal to Bottom.
Seattle, Wash., Dec. 7.—Breaking
his silence for the first time since
his resignation from the supreme
court bench of the state of Wash
ington, former Justice Milo A. Hoot
stated that the troubles with which
he has become involved and which
led to his resignation, were brought
about through trusting a friend
whom he had known for 20 years or
more.
"But let me say first," said Mr.
Root, "I am not corrupt. I d"d not
receive a single penny. I did not
aßk for a cent and. what has been
done has been done honestly and
above-board. I do not care to say
that Judge Gordon took my letters
to the Great Northern railway and
capitalized them for any amount. All
I know about that is what friends
of mine have told me.
"It is untrue that Judge Gordon
wrote the decision in the Harris vs.
Great Northern decision, which has
been attributed to him," declared
Judge Root.
Members of the special bar com
mittee are determined to report fully
on the exact facts on every charge
they can hear. There is no chance
of a whitewash report, and the bar
committee's findings may be even
more drastic than have been inti
mated thus far.
PLANS FOR GREAT ROOSE
VELT HUNT IX AFRICA
Washington, Dec. 6.—President
Roosevelt, in a statement prepared
by Secretary Waicott, of the Smith
sonian Institution made his first offi
cial announcement Saturday regard
ing the hunting trip to Africa, on
which he will start within two week 3
after he retires from the Presidency.
The expedition is to be outfitted by
the Smithsonian Institution, the
President defraying his own ex
penses, and will gather natural his
tory materials for the new National
Museum. Mombasa will be reached
in April next year, but no detailed
itinerary beyond that place has been
made except the general route to
Victoria Nyanza and thence down
the Nile to Khartoum, whpre it i 3
expected the party will arrive about
April, 1910.
IMMENSE PROFITS FOR THE
STANDARD OIL COM PANT
New York, Dec. B.—Figures show
ing some of the profits of the Stand
ard Oil Company today became part
of the court record in the federal
suit to dissolve the Standard, when
John D. Archbold resumed the stand
for a brief examination.
The government inquisitor, on fig
ures submitted, showed that the Con
tinental Company, a Standard sub
sidiary in the Middle West, made
profits of 115 per cent on its cap
italization of $400,000, and that the
Standard Oil Company of Indiana, on
a capitalization of $1,000,000 earned
$55,000,000 between 1599 and 190 G.

A NEW STEAM ROLLER PLANT
The Chas. H. Collins Co. will in-,
stall a Seam Roiling plant to crush j
and grind their own feed and thus
enable them to sell feed to their cus
tomers at greately reduced prices.
A ten-horse power electric motor
will furnish the power to operate
the mill. In addition the equip
ment requires a steam boiler and a
steam coil thru which the grain is
pushed bv a spiral screw and heated ,
as it passes. A smaller machine
for grinding and chopping chicken
feed will also l)e installed. There
is a good deal of this kind of work
demanded here and the new plant
should be a winner from the start.
THE KENNEWICK GREENHOUSE
E. M. Stockman is building a :
large greenhouse in the Anion addi
tion just west of the Collins Com
mission Co. The greenhouse is sup
plement the one he has on his place
west of town. The new one will
have a 150 feet front on Front St.
and will be 160 feet deep. The
first section of the part to be cover
ed with glass or the green house :
proper as well as the furnace room j
and pit are well under way. The'
heating plant which cost approxi
mately 8700 is here and the furnace
will be set as soon as the cement in
the pit hardens.
It is expected to have plants set
in the first section between now and
tin.' first of the year. The new plant
is located on the railroad near the
depot and will be a good advertise-j
ment for the town, in addition to
supplying the needs of this and the
•surrounding towns with florist's
stock and fresh vegetables, radishes
lettuce, rhubard and mushrooms.
