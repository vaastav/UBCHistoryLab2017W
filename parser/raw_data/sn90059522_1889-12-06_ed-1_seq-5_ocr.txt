light-weights, at the rooms of the Cribb
club to-night, resulted in a draw. Me-
Auliffe was the heavier, weighing 144
to Daly's 138 petals. Con McAuliffe
and Bob Drew seconded the New YorKer
While Rill Daly and Danny Gill seconded
Daly. The tight was announced to be

rarer the articles of agreement, and it
was after 11 o'clock when the men en
tered the ring. From the first MeAuliiie

rounds Daly was .-aught off his guard
and received several blows on the jaw.
In the sixth McAuliffe feinted with his
tight, then swinging suddenly, put in
bis left with terrible force on Daly
chin, nearly lilting him off his
feet. In the seventh there
was some close in-fighting, but
most to McAuliffe's advantage. In the
eighth Daly got in his second telling
blow, lauding in McAuliffe*- nose, but
drawing no blood. In the ninth Me-
Auliffe caught Dalv on the jaw with his
right, staggering him, but Daly recov
ered and got in a swinging cut on
"McAuliffe's mouth that swelled his
upper lip. In the next four
rounds McA-liffe did a'l the leading
and Daly's blows were wild. McAuliffe
countered his blows and showered blow
after blow upon him, in several in
stances nearly knocking him over the
ropes. In the fourteenth and fifteenth
rounds Daly appeared somewhat
groggy, but kept gamely at work, and
when 'time was called the referee de
clared the contest a draw. Joe Lanuon
acted as final referee.

under suspension since ISS4. was rein
stated by the payment of a fine of 800.

peting a horse out of class and under
false name, and, for a like offense. Z.
W. Cooper, of Connecticut, r« c 'ived the
same sentence. A. L. Lukeus. of Mt.

ARTISTIC INCENDIARISM.
Clothier WollTs Former Partner
Puts Him in a Bad Light.
New York, Dec. 5.- Sunday night,
last, flames burst from the notion store
of Bernard Wollf. in the heart of the
East side tenement district. They were
extinguished; but now comes Joseph
Sugarman, who to-day made a state
ment, under oath, that puts him in a
bad fix. Sugarman swears that Bar
nard and Abraham Wollf Mid he were
partners in the clothing trade on Third
street, in 1886. They had the entire
house. About the time of the Jewish
holidays . he noticed that Bernard
Wollf was beginning what seemed
to him a series of experiments with dif
ferent qualities and sizes of candles.
It appeared as if he was endeavoring to
learn just how long it would take a
candle of a certain thickness and qual
ity to burn a certain distance. Between
times he was listed by a red-bearded
Russian, who always carried small bot
tles of different colored fluids. Sugar
man did not understand the language
they spoke, so consequently did not
know what they were discussing. But
he saw them comparing the liquids, and
testing them in various ways. Finally
his
CURIOSITY "WAS AROUSED.
and he asked Wollf who the Russian
was. Wollf replied that he was a
friend of his, a druggist doing business
on Third avenue. Further than that he
would tell him nothing. These experi
ments continued until the holidays set
in. When the Jewish new year set in
the whole establishment was closed. It
was to remain so for three days, or
wlnld the holidays lasted. On the
night of the second day, Sugarman
said, he visited the place to see if every
thing was in order. Curtains were
drawn on the windows. What met his
gaze upon opening the door startled
him. Preparations for a good old blaze
were complete. From each cor
ner of a table hung a cotton
bag filled loosly with odds
and ends of cloth. Running
to these and all around the basement
tape. Along each shelf it was fastened
with pins in such a manner as to leave
no mark. The ends of the tape ran to
candles, cut off to a certain length,
which stood about the place. The tape
ran up stairs. Sugarman followed it,
he said. On the floor above the base
ment he found that similar preparations
to those below had been made. The
tape ran from that point to the floor
above, where the state of affairs was
the same. Upward of a thousand yards
of tape had been used. All of it had
been previously treated, Sugarman said
he learned subsequently, with a chemi
cal compound that was simply
PERFECTION IX ITS WAY.
It burned rapidly, made a trifling
smoke and left no odor. Two minutes
after it was started a hot fire would have
l>eeii raging in every room in the house.
Sugarman said it was some time before
he could fully realize what had been
done. When he did he started and
gathered up all the tape. After this he
took down the sacks of rags. Then he
saw Wollf and demanded what it all
meant. He raised such a rumpus that
Wollf's brother threatened to throw him
out of a window. At just this point the
most interesting portion of all comes in.
Sugarman says the Wollfs then begged
him not to say anything about the mat
ter. He refused to countenance the
matter and hurried off to in
form the insurance agent, a
man of tho name of Proeger.
"Judge of my surprise," he said, "when
Proeger also pleaded with me to say
nothing of the matter, as it might get
out." He did nothing more just then,
except to take the tape and sacks home
and stow them away. The Wollfs kept
pleading so hard with him not to make
the matter public that finally he con
sented to let It drop If they would prom
ise never to try anything of the kind
again. They did no. After that, Sugar
man says they also told him how nicely
THE CHEMICALS WOULD WORK.
"My brother used them for a friend of
his in Broadway a little while ago and
it made a beautiful loss," is what Sugar
man said Bernard Wollf had told him at
the time. In conclusion Sugarman
said that as soon as he heard of the fire
at 74 Essex street he became convinced
that Wollf was up to his old tricks
again and determined to expose him.
No arrests have yet been made.

Senator Davis sat with hands folded
and a bored look on his face. Wash

absolutely no attention to the uninter

sat in Brown's seat aud slept peace
fully, Ingalls sat bold upright in his

wrote letters and read the morning
papers during the readme of the mes
sage. Next to him was Moody, upon
whose desk was a floral lyre, which ob
scured the senator. Stanford and Stew
art sat side by side and paid no attention
to the document, except as it related to
silver coinage. To this portion of it
they both listened intently. When the
presidential train of thought ran off the
track on an open switch, and suddenly
floundered In the ditch of the Chinese
problem they began an earnest conver
sation which lasted through to the end
of i lie message. Hoar sat with folded

son looked bored, and lounged ungrace
fully in his chair. Dolph wrote letters
wliMi the message ran upon the shoals
of the trust question. Senator Payne
smiled slightly, and listened in a sort
of cynical way. The tariff platitudes
caused little interest, and the apparent
sense of the assemblage was that it had
heard the same before. Matt Quay had
evidently heard the whole message be
fore, and did little, if anything, during
the reading. He seemed to find it diffi
cult to put in his time, and was bored.
In the house no one paid any attention
to the message. Conversation of the
guerilla order, letter writing and total
absence were the distinguishing char
acteristics of members.

The Minnesota men are pressing for
the appointment of Capt. Reed as dep
uty sergeaut-at-arms. He was defeated
in an exceptional way for sergeant-at
arms ami they consider that he ought
have the position of deputy. The cap
tain himself will not ask for it, but if it
is tendered he will accept. There is
little doubt of his appointment. No
man ever took defeat as philosophically
as he, more especially when it is consid
ered that defeat seemed out of the ques
tion and absolutely impossible up to the
moment of the ballot in caucus. It did
not seem to trouble him in the least. He
kept open house that evening in his
room at the Ebbitt, where he enter
tained a number of Minnesotians and
others, more like a successful candidate
than one who was knocked out.
* •»•
It was curious to note how few men
heard a word of the presidential mes
sage. When asked what they thought
of it their reply was almost identical,
and may be given in the lan
guage of'Roswell P. Flower, of New
York, who sat in one of the front
seats of the house. "It was long
enough." said he, "and I hope it was as
good as it was long, but we did not hear
it on the" front seats." Senator Wash
burn heard it and liked it. He said, in
referring to it, that it was a good mes
sage from beginning to end, and met
with his unqualified approval. Gen.
Orosvenor also heard it and indorsed it
with the exception of those portions
■which refer to civil service, from which
he absolutely and totally dissents. None
of our Minnesota men profess to have
heard a line of it, except Hall, who says
that what little he happened to hear
met with his approval.
Opinions seem to differ on the recom
mendations in regard to silver. Col.
Johnson, chief clerk of the senate,
seemed to think that the position taken
on this question would antagonize the
silver men. Senator Washburn, on the
other hand, said it would meet with
their approval. The basis which the
president and secretary of the treasury j
propose to adopt is the coinage of silver,
or the issue of silver certificates, which
amounts to practically the same thing,
in unlimited quantity at the market
price of silver when bought. As Sen
ator Washburn says, this would make a
silver dollar worth, a dollar instead of
only 72 cents, and practically reraoiie
tizes silver, placing it upon a par with
gold in the national currency.
Representative Dunnell, of Minne
sota, has been suffering with a severe
cold and neuralgia for several days, but
managed to get out hi the opening of
congress, and though by no means well,
is feeling decidedly better.

HANDSOME HARRY HANGED.
The Brutal Murderer of Police
man Brennan Pays the Penalty.
New Yokk, Dec. s.— Harry Carltou,
alias ''Handsome Harry," the murderer
of Policeman Brennan, was hanged at
the Tombs prison at 7:30 this morning.
Carlton was attired in a well-fitting
black suitor clothes. He looked pale,
hut maintained that steady nerve which
he all along displayed. Wnen near the
gallows the sheriff and under sheriff
stepped to one side, and Atkinson at
once ' adjusted the noose, pulled the
black cap over Carlton's head, gave
a signal and the murderer of
Policeman Brennan swung into
the air a dangling, limp mass
of lifeless humanity. A£■ few
convulsive twitches and all was over.
It was within a few seconds of 7:30
o'clock when Carlton walked under the
gallows, and at 7:30 o'clock he was
hanged. The execution was as near
perfection as such things can be. The
crime for which Carlton paid the pen
alty was cold-blooded, cowardly and
heartless in the extreme. It occuned
on Sunday morning on Oct. 28, 1888. His
victim was James Brennan, a policeman
attached to the Thirty-fifth street sta
tion house. The facts of the shooting
as elicited at the trial which begun on
Dee. 10, IMB, are as follows: In com
pany with two young toughs, named
Eddie O'Hearn and "Youle." Burke,
Carlton entered Robert Tucker's bar
room, at the southwest corner of Thirty
third street and Third avenue. It was
early in the mornlug, A few minutes
previously a waiter named Julius
Koesseler had entered the saloon. The
three men asked the waiter to treat.
He refused, saying that he did not
know any of them. Some angry words
followed, tho most vehement being
Carlton. Presently the four went out
on the sidewalk where Carlton and his
companions assaulted Roesscler. The
disturbance attracted the attention (4
Officer Hrennen, who, a square away,
and, as he ran to the scene the trio took j
(light. He pursued them, and, as he
was gaining on the fugitives they:
halted. When Brennan -had come
within a few yards of Carlton, the lat
ter drew out his pistol— of 8. cali
bre—and fired two shots. Both bullets
struck the policeman in the face and
he died two hours later. After the
shooting the murderers fled, but after a
brief chase they wore arrested by
Officer Coleman. Carlton claimed on!
his trial that he did the .hooting lv self
defense. : - . •
DELANO IS ON DECK.
The Nath nal Wool Growers Asso
ciation Re-elects Its Old . Presi
dent.
Washington. Dec. 5.— -At the woo
growers' convention to-day the National
Wool Growers- Association of the.
United States was reorganized by the
adoption of a constitution and the elec
tion of the following officers to serve
one year: Hon. Columbus Delano, of
Ohio, president; Hon. J. T. Rich, of
Michigan, vice president; C. H. Beall,
of West Virginia, treasurer; George H.
Wallace, of Missouri, secretary, and
Davis Cossitt, of New Tork. assistant
secretary. E. N. Bissell, of Vermont;
W. L. Blake, of Texas, and John Mc-
Dowell, of Pennsylvania, were elected to
act with the officers of the association on
the executive hoard. The committee
appointed to draft an address • to the
wool growers of the United States, hav
ing reported to the convention that it
required additional time in which to
prepare the address, a resolution was
introduced and adopted granting fur
ther time and authorizing the executive
board to revise and publish the same at
its earliest convenience. All matters
pertaining to legislation were, by reso
lution, referred to a committee to be
hereafter designated by the president.
One of the principal subjects of dis
cussion to-day was the undervaluation
of so-called ring waste. It was shown
that during the last year the importa
tion of this so-called waste equalled
TIIK ENTIRE WOOL CLIP
of either Ohio or Texas; that it is
superior for nearly all wool manufactur
ing purposes to the finest scoured wool
in the country, ann yet it was said, it
paid a duty of only 10 cents a 100,
when it should have paid, upon a proper
and just classification, from 30 to 60
cents per pound, it was stated that last
year about 24,000*000 pounds of this wool
was imported, principally from Brad
ford, England, and sold in the markets
of this country at from 92 to 65 cents a
100, while in the same market tine
scoured California wool sold at 55 cents
per pound. Quotations from the Phila
delphia market were read in support of
this assertion. It was also stated
that this fine grade wool was
manipulated by machinery, before ship
ment, especially constructed, to coil
into small rings in imitation of waste
for the sole purpose of evading the law
a id avoiding the payment of just cus
toms duties. A committee, consisting
of Messrs. Lawrence, McDowell, Harps
ter, Cossitt, and Wallace, waited upon
Secretary Windom this afternoon, and
protested against the admission of this
so-called waste at a rate less than is
charged upon wool schedules as partly
man in act tired wool. The secretary
stated to the committee that he was then
engaged in a thorough investigation of
this subject, and he assured them that
full justice would be done the wool
growing interests of the United States.
The next annual meeting of the associa
tion will be held at Chicago on the sec
ond Wednesday in June next. The con
vention adjourned until to-morrow.

PERRIN ARRESTED AGAIN. §
The Assistant Cashier of the Hur
ley Bank in Hard Luck. i.y
Special to the Globe. ' ' ■*' ',
sAshland,5 Ashland, Wis.. Dec. Phelps Per
rin was bound for trial .'' to-day on the
charge of robbing tho Iron Exchange*
Bank at Hurley. Ball was fixed at
$4,000, which the defendant readily
furnished, and he had just started for
the street with his attorneys when
Sheriff Maltson once more placed him
under arrest. Perrin was taken into
custody the second time on an order of
arrest issued out of the Milwaukee
county court for Edwin W. Baker and
Phelps Perrin. The case Is a quasi
criminal one, and is brought by the
United States Express company to re
cover $39,000 alleged to have been stolen
from the express company. Ball is re
quired in the sum of $25,000 for each de
fendant. Perrin has thus far failed to
secure sureties and is in custody of the
sheriff. The warrant was read to Baker
at the county jail this afternoon. Baker
has not been able to secure $4,000 bail,
and it is extremely unlikely that he can

Fakgo, XT.. D., Dec. 5.— A case came
up in the justice court to-day which will
test the points recently enunciated by
Judge Lauder, of the Wahpeton dis
trict, declaring the testimony of wit
nesses not necessary of record where
the defendant is held to the distric
court. In the case to-day the distric
attorney was absent, the judge appoint
ed himself prosecuting attorney, overt
ruled all exceptions made by the det
fendant's attorney, and held the pris
oner to the district court. If Judge
Lauder's opinion is reliable and the.'
action of Justice Barrett legal, attor
neys for the defence cut a very small

ALL FOR G .AND LARCENY.
Six Prisoners Indicted by the
Grand Jury Arraigned Before
Hicks.
Six prisoners were arraigned before
Judge Hicks yesterday ou indictments
found by the grand jury. All were
charged with grand larceny and all
pleaded not guilty. Chirle'i Boland
.stole jewelry and clothing and was
placed under $500 ; bonds. He had no
attorney and W. G. Merson was^assigned
to his case. Lem Connor, a pale-faced
negro, pleaded not guilty to two indict
ments. His bail was placed at $50. on
each indictment, and his case was set
for Dec. 11. The man who answered
to the name of John Olson was a Swede
who has often been under arrest before.
He stole some pocketbooks, etc.
from Hale, Thomas & Co.'s store.
His case was set for Dec. 11.
and his bail was fixed at $400. Harry
Benham, a pronounced blonde,' who
would look better at. hoeing potatoes
than at playing the role of "Black Bart"
around the union depot, said he was
seventeen years old. He will be tried
next Monday. When the names of
James Wheeler were called, two men
looked like old timers, stepped to the
clerk's desk. They seemed well ac
quainted with the ropes and entered a
vigorous kick against being arraigned
on au Indictment without ever having
a preliminary hearing. They stole
clothing. W. H. Donahue, they thought,
would defend them, and their trial will
come off next Tuesday.
LA WING ABOUT LAND.. .
William Leving.-}. Virtually Ac-
I cases Edison Gibbs of Swind
! ling.
; William H. Levings thinks that he has
jbeeu defrauded. in a real estate deal.
[The alleged swindler is Edison A.
Gibbs. The suit was on trial yesterday
before Judge Lochren. Levings claims
that Gibbs induced him and three other
parties to purchase forty acres of land
out near Hopkins station., at $000 per
jicre. After the land was bought and
divided into fifths, one-lifth going to
each person, it was discovered that
Gibbs had not paid a . cent for
his one-fifth. He alleged ; that his
'share had been given him as a sort of <
{commission for effecting the sale. Lev
ling affects, to believe otherwise and
alleges that Gibbs induced him and the
■others to pay an exorbitant price for
the land— mora than the owner asked
for it. The deal having been conduct
ed through Gibbs, he is alleged to have
bled enough money out of the other par
ties to the purchase to pay for his share.
On this ground Levings asks that Gibbs
be ousted and that his share be divided
equitably among the other four part
ners. The case was not finished.

PERTINENT HAYINGS.
Ed. A. Stevens—The statement of
Chief Stetson that the building ordi
nance supersedes the state law and re
lieve- him of responsibility in the mat
ter of seeing that the law is enforced is
the veriest bosh. The law and ordi
nance aro both in force and it is time
that our city officials attended to their
sworn duties and quit trying to trans
fer the blame toothers. It -might not
be amiss to give the saloonkeepers aud
crap-shooters a rest next Sunday and
instruct the police to report a list of all
high buildings with aud without tire
escapes. More lives may be saved by
so doing. '
Secretary Hall, Board of Trade— We
have shipped eighteen cars of clothing
to the Dakota sufferers, but we yet have
the- money in our possession, audits,
course has not yet been decided. We
are, so to speak, on the horns of a
dilemma. All public and official sources
tell us there is little or no suffering.
On the other hand private advices tell
us that there Is great suffering there.
