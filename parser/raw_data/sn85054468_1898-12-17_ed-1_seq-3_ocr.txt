Bixey's Bill to Admit Them to
Government Homes.
THE TARDY OLIVE BRAXCIl

ITictr Old Asc-Tlie "War .4i;aliit

Act.
Representative Rlxey of Virginia thinks
that the time hac come for Congress to
co further than even President McKinlcy
lias yet advocated In bridging over the
chasm between North and South that re
sulted from the four years of clil war
fare thirl) -odd j cars ago. He thinks that
the blood of North and South so freely
ypllled on the slopes of San Juan should
move the reunited country to consider the
sufferings of the living Confederate sol
diers who are now poor and old and
needy, and whoso StatC3 are unable to
care for them as they should be cared for.
Yesterday, moved thereto by the Presi
dent's speech at Atlanta Wednesday last.
In which he advocated the care by the
general Government of the Confederate
graves, Mr. Rlxey Introduced the follow
ing bill:
'That from and after the passage of
this act all soldiers' homes and other In
stitutions maintained by the Government
for the maimed, crippled and needy sol
diers and sailors of the United States shall
be open to all soldiers and sailors of the
civil war of 1SC1-CJ upon the same terms,
and without discrimination as to whether
they were enlisted upon the side of the
Union or of the Confederacy."
Mr. Rixey Is a Virginian, a big, power
ful man, with an Interesting face parUal
ly veiled by a thick black beard. Speak
ing of his bill yesterday, he said: "Presi
dent McKinley has advocated publicly the
care of the Confederate dead by the gen
eral Government; my bill asks Congress
to care for the aged and crippled Confed
erates living In so far as to admit them
to the national hornet for the soldiers.
The veterans of the South say that they
fought as bravely and as long and as well
as they could; they have laid down their
arms; they hae not grudgeJ their share
of the cost of maintaining the Northern
veterans who suffered In the conflict, and
now that their sons have proved that they
are altogether loyal to the Stars and
Stripes once more, they ask that the new
Union be cemented by admltUng them to
the .national homes and saving them from
dying uncared for.
"I do not know how many veterans
there aro In the Confederacy who would
wish to take advantage of this bill. I
have no estimate. But I do know that
many of tho States of the South arc poor
and cannot afford to care for their sons
as they would llko and as they should,
and 1 know that these ought to bo cared

"Tho bill docs not contemplate any new
homes, nor any aid to the States homes
that exist on a limited 'scale throughout
the South. Still less does It ask any
pensions. The South Is too poor to pen
sion Its men on any such scale as the na
tional Goernment, but It has done what
it could. Now If the Go eminent will
take In some of our old soldiers we can
better care for the rest.
"I do not want anyone to think that
this bill is hastily or lightly drawn. I
have been considering Its contents for
some time. My introducing It was only
hastened a little by President McKlnlev's
speech. This seemed tho very moment
when the bill would attract the most at
tention and would be most canvassed,
and so I put It In. I sincerely hope that
It may be widely and favorably discuss
ed. Whether It will becomo a. law I do
not know, but I do know that It ought to
become such. Perhaps Its chances might
have been better had It been introduced
by a Union eteran, but 1 do not know.
I am sure u number of veterans of the
Federal forces now in Congress will sup
port the measure."
WANT AH EXTRA SESSION.
Petition Anklum Hie PrTiIilcnt to
Cull Oik- in March.
Indications point more strongly each day
toward the probability of an extra session
of Congress being called in March, Imme
diately after adjournment. There are
many senators and- representatives who
are of the opinion that an extra session
will be absolutely necessary In order to
transact much of tho business which is
just now holding tho attention of the
country.
For several days past a petition has
been quietly circulated on the lioor of the
House asking tho President to call an ex
tra session In March. Tho petition urges
that In the call the President specifically
designate that the session will be for the
sole purpose of considering financial leg
islation. Beyond that, little Is known of the pe
tition, except that It has been cstcnsUcly
signed already. The proponents of the
scheme express confidence In their ability
to secure the signatures of a big majority
of the Republicans in the House.
In the Senate, too, there Is a well-defined
Impression In certain quarters that
an extra, session will bo necessary. The
senators In favor of It do not, however,
maintain that it should be called for the
exclusive purpose of dealing with the
question of finance.
They point out other things which they
regard as of great Importance, among
them the necessity for providing forms of
government for the colonies and such ac
tion as may be necessary In regard to the
probable recommendations of the British
American Joint High Commission.
It Is thought that the Commission will
conclude Its work soon after January L
and the resultant treaty of Quebec; may
furnish a topic for much discussion in the
Senate. These and other matters of less
Importance are urged by those in favor
of an extra session.

The first meeting at this session of Con
gress of tho Senate Committee on the
District of 'Columbia was held -yesterday,
when a largo number of District bll a were
referred to special subcommittees for ln
estlgatIon, one bill ordered reported fa
vorably to the Senate, and the nomination
of Ttichard, Welghtman as Rock Crcok
Park commissioner recommended favora
bly for confirmation. -
The bill upon which a favorable report
was authorized was House bill B8S7, for-
the prevention of smoke In the District of
Columbia. A bill of this kind has been
urged for some time by the property own
ers of the District, who have argued that
tho smoke emitted by railroad engines,
factories and large buildings In the city
was ruinous to tho many fine white stone
buildings, as well as a menace to health.
The bill provides that on and after six
months from its passage the emission of
dense thick black or gray smoke or cin
ders from any smokestack or chimney
used In connection with any stationary
engine, stenm boiler or furnace of any
description within the District of Colum
bia shall be deemed to be a public nuis
ance. Nothing in the act, however, shall
be construed as applied to chimneys, of
buildings used exclusively for private res
idences. A fine of not less than $10 nor
more than $100 Is Imposed for each viola
tion of the act.
Special committees were .appointed to
consider and report to the full committee
on the following matters:
Senators McMillan, Proctor and Gor
man, three Senate bill previously intro
duced by Senator McMillan, proiding
$3,000 for grading and regulating the
Adams Mill Itoad from the Columbia
Itoad to Kansas Avenue; a bill to extend
New York Avenue from 1'lorlda Avenue
to the Bladcnsburg I'ikc, or District line,
J30.0U0 being appropriated for that pur
pose; and a bill to extend Sixteenth Street.
The last bill provides fcr the condemna
tion of the land necessary for the widen
ing of Sixteenth Street from Florida
Avenue to Columbia Itoad to ICO feet lif
width, with circle at Sixteenth Street and
Columbia Itoad, and from Columbia
Itoad to Pinoy Branch, on line of Six

Senators I'roctor. Gorman, and Stewart
were authorized to consider and report on
a. bill regulating tho height of buildings
in the District of Columbia, which pro
idts that the Commissioners of the Dis
trict of Columbia shall reraoe danger

Favorable action wa taken on the nom
ination of Richard Welghtman to be a
member of the Rock Creek Park Commis
sion. Mr. Welghtman has been filling this
position sinco July 13. Hi nomination,
however, did not go to the Senate until a
few days ago. His place on the commis
sion is that formerly llllcd by R. "Ross
Perry, who resigned.
Tho House Committee for the District
of Columbia held both morning and after
noon sessions yesterday. In the morning,
after hearing Commissioner Beach on the
bills regulating the height of buildings
and authorizing the Commissioners to re
move unsafe ones, the committee decided
to report them favorably.
A bill punishing anyone who might Im
personate a welghtmaster was also faor
ably passed upon.
In the afternoon, W. II. Seaman, a law
yer of this city, appeared in advocacy of
a bill drawn by himself and introduced by
Representative Burrows of Marsachusc ts.
Tills bill provides imprisonment for any
woman who may have, or be about to
have, an illegitimate chi'd, until she
gives bond for its maintenance, or names
its father. In the latter case, she is to
bo released and he Is to bo Imprisoned
until he gives n like bond. J. S. Cowdon,
of this city, has asked that he be heard
In opposition to tho bill.
After the hearing, tho committee told
Mr. Seaman that If he would radically
amend his bill it would be considered.
Representative Sturtcvant has introduc-.
ed a bill authorizing the Commissioners
of the District to redeem certain certifi
cates of indebtedness- issued by the late
board of audit of the District of Colum
bia, for the redemption of which there Is
no existing law, and to pay to the holders
of these and to the holders of llioje Is

HAUNA ELECTION CASE.
The Matter Taken Vp by Sennte
Committee.
The Hanna election case was taken up
S'esterday morning by the Senate Com
mittee on Privileges and Elections, and
there was considerable discussion, based
on the report of the committee appointed
by the Ohio legislature on the charges of

Tho matter was finally referred to a
special subcommittee composed of Sen
ators Hoar, Spooncr, nnd Turley, who
were Instructed to consider the case and
report to tho committee.
The committee also authorized a favor

ESstlnxnteji for Improving
An.
neoatla lUier;
The Secretary of TVar yesterliiyiientrto
Congress a report, mado by TJeift. CoL
Charles J. Alien, corps of engineers, of a
survey of the Anacostla River and esti
mates of tho cost of Improving the same.
The survey was mr.de in accordance with
a Joint resolution of Congress, approved
April 11, 1S93.
Lieut. Col. Allen states that, taking as
a basis the present plan of deepening the
Potomac to twenty feet, tho ncccssury
depths In tho Anacostla are twenty feet
'at low water, with a width of too feet
from the mouth of the rlcr to the navy
yard; thence a depth of sixteen feet, with
a width of 200 to COO feet, as far as Den
ning bridge. Above tho bridge aro the
flats, which aro beyond tho city limits,
and Col. Allen thinks their Improvement
may. bo deferred for tho present.
Two plans nnd sits of estimates are
'proposed. Tho first is to deepen and
.widen tho stream as abv;e, and to de
posit tho dredged material on the fiats,
raisins them to a height of seven feet
.above low water, and building a fourteen
foot retaining wall. The cost, including
contingencies, will be:
( Prom tho mouth to the navy yard,
$1,218,523: from the navy yard to Penning
bridge, $976,155; total recommended, J2.191,
720; above Benning bridge, JHtCOO; total,
J2.820,320.
If tho embankment and 'drainage bo
omitted, this cost will bo reduced to
J2.1O3.1S0.
The second plan Is exactly like tho first
with tho addition of other fining neces
sary to raise tho flats to fourteen feet
above low water. Tho estimate follows:
Below navy yard, $3,291,7M; navy yard to
Benning, $2,6iC,930; total recommerMed,
;,KS,7S0; above Benning, Jl,028,u00; total,
IG.OCT.ISO.
Assuming that tho second plan will not
be adopted on account of tho heavy cost,
and that Improvement above Benning is
deferred for tho present, Lieut. Col. Allen
suggests tho first plan ns serving present
needs and as Itast expensive.
Tho estimates have been Wde on the
assumption that large and continuous ap
propriations will be made, and It Is be
lieved that JtOO.CCO can advantageously be
expended annually.
Col. Allen has found it impracticable to
make ettlmates of the cost of obtaining
the lands needed. The estimates do not
includo the cost of altering bridges or
protecting bridge piers afTecttd or endan
gered by the Improvements.
GEN. BHECKUfBIDGE OBJECTS.
He IJock ot I.IKe fien. Corliln'n
Army Iteorjranlxatioii 1'litnn.
Gen. Breckinridge, inpsdtor general of
the United States army, gave som Inter
est! testimony before- the House Mili
tary Affairs Committee yesterday after
noon. While carefully avoiding-any out
right criticism of his superior officers, ho
jet plainly showed that he, Mscnted the
,practlcnl dlsestablishment-'fjf his depart
ment at the beginning of the. war, for
which he held Gen. Corblir'td blame.
Gen. Breckinridge besati by objecting
to the manner in which Vhe recommen
dations for his department had b?cn al
tered in tho bill by the adjutant general.
It Is worthy of mention thUiH the other
staff departments s'ubmlhednnblr recom
mendations to the adjufatlpgencrars de
partment, and even- one ci them has been'
cut down except the last named. , oen
erals Stanton, Ludlngton, Hagan and
Major Morrison, representing Gen. Lie
ber, have all complained of this.
Gen. Breckinridge further obtccted that
the rank of his officers had en so ic
duced In the bill that it amounted to
sending a private to Inspect a sergeant.
No good results could be expected.
Representative Hay wished to know
what were the duties of the inspector
general's office. ,
Gen. Brcckinridgo stated that before
the war the department had the district
system of Inspection, where each officer
was the representative of the Secretary.
During the war and since, thf3 system
was abandoned and the officers were
placed under tho control of the various
general officers In the field and did what
these generals commanded. They did not
report to him, and had not j ct done so.
"This system Is not a novelty with us,"
he continued. "How much control the
Inspector general has over his officers de
pends on the judgment I would not like
to say tho whim of the Secretary cf
War. Congress does not prescribe the
duties of the Inspector general's office."
In answer to a question from Repre
sentative Lcntz, Gen. Breckinridge said
that tho change had been made on the
advice of the adjutant general, and ad
mitted that it had demoralized his office,
depriving him of all control of his c Ul
cers. In answer to a question from Represen
tative Hay, he said that there was a
suspicion that the object of the change
was to show that the Inspector general's
office was useless and ought to be con
solidated with that of the adjutant gen
eral. "If they had any other object than
this, I don't know what It Is," he con
tinued. "Gen. Corbln told me recently
that ho thought that our departments
ought to be organized alike. The differ
ence between them. In my opinion, is
that the adjutant general Is the mouth
piece of authority and tho Inspector gen
eral Is the eyes nnd ears of the Secretary
of War. But If our reports aro made to
the adjutant general, It leaves us helpless
to know even that they have ever been
sent."
Coming to tho dlscusslph of affairs In
Cuba, Gen. Breckinridge said that Cuba
was In a condition far removed from
peace. There had been? there a change of
dynasty, a change of language, and an
unsettled condition had arisen that could
easily breed trouble. tttTho great neces
sity," he continued, 'is to' have a show
of present force that will c prevent even
the possibility of trouble. The President
has managed things iso admirably that
we may not have any difficulty at all.
It you give a man everything he wants,
and promlsa him cverj thing he may
want, and have a force,on, jiand that can
whip him If ho does -make trouble, he
isn't likely to make It' '-
Gen. Breckinridge said he favored the
Miles bill with its arniy, proportioned to
the population of tlie country rather
than a fixed number like- that provided by
the Hull bill. t
Representative Cos1 questioned Gen.
Brecklnridgo quite sharply In regard to
the need of having troops in the Islands.
The general said that tho question was a
political one and outside of his province,
but that he personally thought the object
of keeping troops there was to jireservc
order whllo the people were organizing
free governments of, their own.
Gen. Breckinridge concluded with a
Pains In the chest when a person has

Chamberlain's Fain Balm and bound on
