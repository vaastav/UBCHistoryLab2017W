THE PRESIDENTS MESSAGE.
e valedictory message of Presi
Harrison, necessarily long, is al-
ther too long to appear in the lo-
ewspaper. It is a message of un-
1 excellence and importance. Few
who have occupied the presiden
hair have entered more earnest-
Ld closely into the business and
details of governmental affairs
President Harrison. It is not
ssary to say that his document
le, comprehensive and practical.
fcull a few facts from the message:
president declares that the coun-
favored with a prosperity une
ed in the history of the world,
message shows that during the
lie between 1SS0 -1S90 the capital
oyed in seventy-five cities in
ked more than $500,000,000; the
s earned $675,000,000; the num
f its employed 856,000, while the
s of the employes increased per
a 6161. Of the result of the Mc
yy bill the increase of industrial
lishments, and the increase in
bumber of hands employed, to-
?r with higher wages, shows the
at to the manufacturing classes,
employer and employe, while the
ral average prices of agricultur-
joducts indicate prosperity.
sident Harrison believes protec
s a mighty instrument for the de
ment of our national wealth and
Ut powerful agency in protecting
tomes of our workingmen from
wasion of want.
h president says that the full ben-
bf the reciprocal arrangements
ot be realized immediately, but
pects that within a short time it
ecure fully one-third of the to
ade of Central and South Ameri-
r us. which amounts to about
00.000 annually. In 18S5 we had
fi per cent of this trade,
ares are given revealing the as
iinr increase in the value of our
jtic exports under the reciproci
eements with foreign countries.
I of the most interesting parts
message refers to the condition
ional finances. The misleading
inents concerning the public rev
are met with three decisive
First, that the public debt has
reduced since March 4, 18S9,over
30,000 and the annual interest
es over S11,6S1,000. Second,that
I?nsion payments during this ad
iration up to November 1, 1892,
?ated $432,564,000, as against
KS.OOO from March, 18S5, to Mar.
Third, that under the existing
bp to the first of this month,
$93,000,000 of revenue, princi-
on sugar, wnicn wouia nave
received if the duty had been
has gone into the pockets of
ople. The peculiar method in
the Cleveland anministration
the public money to favored
s is recalled by the comment
President's message:
there are any who still think
he surplus should have been kept
circulation by hoarding it in
basury, or depositing it in favor
Inks without interest, while the
lment continued to pay to tnese
anks interest upon the bonds
ted as security for the deposits,
p think that the extended pen-
gislation was a public robbery,
ht the duties upon sugar
have been maintained, I am
It to leave the argument where
' rests, while we wait to see
?r these criticisms will take the
f legislation."

?asury at the end of the fiscal

ficit that ha3 been predicted.
esident suggests that the "re-
jat of bonds in the future before
ty should be a matter of con-
Ice and not of comDlusion."
tprising revelation is made that
laims now pending aggregate
b,000.
ncrease in postal revenues and
il business is accepted as an
be of general prosperity, and
tifying fact is announced that
the next fiscal year the Post
Office Department should show a sur
plus of of nearly $1,000,000. A patri
otic and vigorous appeal for the
maintenance and extension of the
American merchant marine is one of
the significant parts of the message.
The President compliments the Navy
Department on the progress of the
work of constructing the new navy.
Although there has been expended
during this administration for the in
crease of the navy more than $35,000,
000, besides $8,000,000 for labor in our
navy yards, the message says there
was not the smallest scandal or charge
of fraud or partiality. This is a high
compliment to Secretary Tracy.
Judging by the aggregate work of
the Pension Department, the greatest
in the history of the office, the Presi
dent feels that the office has been ef
ficiently oaganized and the work ef
fectively performed. The Commis
sioner estimates that the maximum
expenditure for pensions will be reach
ed June 30, 1894, and will be $188,000,
000. President Harrison, despite the
clamor of the democratic papers in
their attack on the pension system,
patriotically defends the right of dis
abled veterans to the gratitude of the
nation.
The development of our exports of
cattle and hog products, largely
through the efforts of Secretary Rusk,
of the Agricultural Department, is
commented upon. President Harrison
favors national control of quarantine
with adequate power lodged in the
Executive to protect our people
against plague invasion. He also fa
vors restriction of immigration.
The message closes with a patriotic
appeal for pure elections, an earnest
reference to the deplorable violence
exercised against the colored people
of the South, and with the declaration
"that there are no new frontiers to
our possible development, ixetro-
gression would be a crime."

UNCLE SA3rS MONEY.
The annual report of the comptrol
ler of the currency, just prepared for
submission to congress, shows a "trade
balance" for the year ending October
31, 1862, of $216,266,000, as against
$112,268,000 for the preceding year.
Of this balance $13,352,000 lay in ex
cess of exports over imports of gold
and silver, as against an amount in
the balance of 1891 of $72,703,000.
On June 18, 1892, the total deposits
in the associated banks of the city of
New York were $543,663,100. The
highest amount ever reached before
was $455, 396,300 on December 26,1891.
The same plethora of money existed
in all money centers; the rate of in
terest for the year averaged on de
mand loans !. per cent to 3 per cent
and time loans and commercial paper
ranged about 2 per cent higher.
The number of banks in existence
October 31, 1892, Was 3788, an increase
for the year of 94; the capital stock
was $693,868,665, an increase of $9,
112,800; bonds deposited to secure cir
culation, $164,833,000, an increase of
$11,932,650; bank notes outstanding
were $172,432,146, an increase of
$257,588.
The amount of paper money in cir
culation October 31, 1892, was:
National bank notes, $172,432,146
United States notes (greenbacks) 332,0S0,234
Treasury notes, 114,567,423
Gold certificates, 120,255,349
Silver certificates, 324,552,532
Currency certificates, 10,550,000

of such notes has bee
The present market val
ue of the silver purchased is $102,64S,
644, showing a depreciation in value
of $14,134,646.
The comptroller recommends vari-.
ous amendments to laws now in force,
thus: That the minimum deposit of
government bonds required by na
tional banks be reduced to $1,000 in
case of banks of $50,000 capital, and
to $5,000 in cases of banks whose cap
ital, exceeds $50,000.
That national banks be allowed to
issue notes equal to the par value of
the United States bonds which they
may purchase and assign to the treas
urer of the United States for the pur
pose of securing circulation. ,
That the monthly withdrawal of
bonds pledged to 'secure circulation
shall not exceed $4,500,000 in the ag
gregate. That the tax on national bank cir
culation be repealed. That the limit
of any single loan be 10 per cent of
the bank's capital and surplus.
That the government issue bonds
with a long period to run, and at a low
rate of interest, with which to retire
the present bonded debt of the United
States, which bonds may be used as a
basis to secure national bank circulation.

By the terms of the act of February
23, 1878, the secretary of the treasury
was directed to purchase and coin into
silver dollars silver bullion not less in
value than $2,000,000 worth and not
more than $4,000,000 worth monthly.
This act was supplemented by act of
July 14, 1890. While in force the gov
ernment purchased silver and coined
378,166,793 standard dollars, the seign
iorage on which (that is,the difference
between the price paid for the silver
and the face value of the coinage) was
$69,967,531.

der act of February 28, 1878, $378,166,793

ber 31, 1892, 250,493,S36

This coinage accumulated in the
treasury vaults until the happy de
vice was conceived of putting it in
circulation by the use of paper sub
stitute. As shown above, $324,552,
532 are serving the people by proxy.
Under the act of July 14, 1890, the
government purchased monthly 4,
500,000 ounces of silver, and pays for
the same in treasury notes issued for
that purpose and equal at par to the
cost of such silver. Thus the currency
of the country is arbitrarily increased
monthlv. Up to November 1, 1892,the
Democrats are not agreed as to
what the coming issue is. Some of
think it is the tariff: some think it is
State money; some think it is the free
coinage or silver. The last-namea
faction has pretty good reasons for its
belief. It was the silver people who
beat the Federal Elections bill in the
Fifty-first Congress, and in the Fifty-
third Congress they will be in a po
sition to beat the tariff or any other
bill if they choose, oi to compel a
consideration of their own measure.
Mr. Andrew Jackson Warner, presi
dent of the Bimetallic League, has
issued a circular wnicn outlines tne
programme of the silver men. He al
leges that protection has not brought
prosperity to everybody; and that
the democrats will soon find that a
revenue tariff will not bring prosperi
ty either. The evils that exist, he
savs. can be - cured neither by, tariff
reform nor by a protective tariff.
Hence, he says:
"The next issue will be the money
question. Nor will this issue be long
delayed. Its suppression by the two
leading parties in the campaign just
closed did not settle it. The people
are being educated on money ques
tions faster than politicians compre
hend, and they will not submit forever
to the robber- of an increasing gold
standard. Now is the time for bime
tallists to organize and pu3h to the
front the issue of free bimetallic coin
age
Gen. Warner's prediction is not the
raving of an irresponsible lunatic. It
is based on fact3. The silver men will
certainly be strong enough in both
branches of the next Congress to hold
up any measure they choose until its
promoters consent to a "deal" by
which a silver bill can be passed. That
they will use whatever strength they
have to the best political advantage is
pretty certain from their record in
the Fifty-first Congress.
So we are not at all sure that Gen.
Warner is not right when he calls the
question of free coinage "the coming
issue."
The publishers of the Youth's Com
panion issue a beautiful prospectus
which shows their new and wonderful
building,describes the process of mak
ing that excellent journal, giving fact3
in regard to its growth, the present
circulation, the names of its contri
butions and other useful informa
tion. The growth of this journal has
been phenomenal, even for America,
where almost anything can be ex
pected. Its circulation exceeds one
half a million, and its influence is
great on the young people of America.
While its name carries the idea that
it is published for the youth of the
land, the fact is that it is read by peo
ple of all ages and men of all profes
sions. It is difficult in a brief article
to say good things enough of this
weekly, which so many "everywhere
read with pleasure and profit. The
