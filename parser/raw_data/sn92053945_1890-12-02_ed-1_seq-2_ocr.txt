President Harrison's second message to
the Firty- first congress wu submitted to
that body at noon ou Monday. Like all
documents of its character it Is volumin
out, containing about fifteen thousand
words. What it lacks In breadth aod
depth is attempted to supply In length
As a nicely written paper it may attract
commendatory opinion, but not as a
document of state.
The m stage cannot fail but be a dis
appointment to that large body of pro
gressive republicans who believe tbat
their leaders are preaching false doctrines
and steering Ibe republican ship in dan
gerous waters. The president pays no at
tention to the voles of sn indignant peo
ple Ibat they want less taxes and not
more. Be unblii9bing!y indorses McKin
ley's odious bill as a wise and beneficial
measure, which In a short time
will prove itself to be the psnecea
for all economic Ills. He auatalns the
work of the present congress and that
its labors may be further crowned with
glory urges the Immediate passge of the
bayonet election or federal force bill. In
fact the whole message of the president
smacks of partisanship rather than
statesmanship He adheres closely
throughout to the line of policy laid
down by the republican leaders in defer
ence to their mill -owning masters, and
Mr. Harrison bows In humble obeisance
to their will.
The Aaors publishes the president's
message in supplement! form, with a
tariff schedule on the reverse side show
Ing the advances made by the McKinley
monstrosity over the former tariff. While
la this connection It Was not Intended to
abow the unsoundness of the president's
logic on economic questions, th; sheet in
itself would make an admirable demo
cratic campaign document In 1803. The
cold bard figures in the tariff schedule
spesk louder and appeal more strongly to
reason than the gaudy word-painting of
Tresldent Harrison.

LONDOS, Dec 2. Tbe Irish parliamenta
rians int tat noon yestenlayto decide, as
the saying goes, tbe fate of .Charles Stew
art Parnell whether he shall lead the Ir
ish or some other lender be selected. But
It ia doubtful if that way of putting it Is
just right. From Parnell's attitude and
the way he addressed his colleagues, it
looks a good deal more like deciding
whether t here shall be one Irish party or
two. It is already asserted, by those who
know Parnell's methods, tbat he is playing
for delay, and in tbe meantime his agents
are working the Irish machine for all it ia
worth among the people in Ireland, get
ting resolutions passed ia his favor, and
-drumming np pnblic sympathy for him In
view of the expected plebiscite which is to
decide whether or not the people will sus
tain bim against his opponents.
A Meeting of Angry Opponents,
About seventy-five of the Irih members
of parliament were present at the meeting
which was on the dead secret, the only
newspaper man allowed to be present being
he of tbe Freeman's Journal Tbe storm of
oratorical invective and pleading was a
wild one, as could be heard by the hun
dreds of newspaper reporters who crowded
around the building and sought by get
ting near the doors or windows to get
some inkling of what was going on inside.
"We are your comrades, not your slaves,"
angrily shouted Sexton to Parnell, so
loudly that it could be plainly be heard by
those outside. As for Parnell when
going into tbe ball he seemed serene.
The Policy ef May.
As stated above the Parnell policy was
one of delay. Redmond was bis champion.
while Sexton bore the heat and burden of
the opposition. . Barry moved that Par
nell be required to retire from the leader
ship. Nolan moved an amendment that
the question be postponed until the mem
bers should persona lly ascertain the views
of their constituents, and tbe party should
meet in Dublin, and on this issue tbe bat
tle raged. Sexton declared that the re
tirement was imperative. Redmond made
a passionate plea for delav. and around
these two champions arose the leaner
lights with plena for one course or the
other.
rarnert In His On a Behalf.
At last the leader arose to nlead his own
cause. Plead is hardly the word. He was
aggressive from the start. He ws
sionate. In great contrast to his former
cold, incisive speeches he attacked his en
emies vigorously and hotly. He said that
those responsible for tbe decision of tha
party seemed to forget what was due to
tbemselvea, tbeir country and him. The
men who were most consuicuoaslv aimtnst
him llealy and Sexton would have, to
bear their responsilality in all this. llealy
bad been trained for this warfare. Who
trained him? V bo saw his genius and
gave him his first chauce in public life
Who got him bis Heat in parliament, tend
ing, rebuking, restraining hint?
Blasts for Healy and McCarthy.
Parnell continued: "That Healy is here
to-day to destroy roe is due to myself; but
I am glad he is here even to destroy me. If
be understands tbe meaning and effect of
hla proceedings. Healy reminds me of his
services. He baa not been slow to remind
me of tbem at any time. I understand he
attended the recent meeting in Dublin
which called on me not to retire. Who
asked him to do so? Did If Who asked
McCarthy to travel to London to say tbat
he would be able to give information
which would throw a different complex
ion on hidden events Did I
Barry Called Leader-Killer.
"Why did my officers encourage me to
take my position on the bridge if they
were going to act as traitors and band me
over to another commander-in-chief I
did not ask them for the certificate of char
acter given by tbe Dublin meeting. A
leader-killer, Barry, has been put np to
stab me, as be stabbed the old lion, Isaac
Butt, in days gone by. I remember well
that though Butt arraigned me, I never by
word or deed counselled attacks upon
him. but allowed tha old man to go down
to an honored grave, rather than seek to
step Into the shoes of a politician who,
however grave his faults, had created a
great movement, and given me and many
others the power to participate therein.
