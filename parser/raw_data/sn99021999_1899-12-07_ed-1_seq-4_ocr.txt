HAVANA , Dec. C President McKlnley's
tntflsngo to congress hns been received by
Cubans of all classes with much satisfaction.
Tvon the leaders of the extreme party admit
thin , and the announcement that there will
bo no American civil governor has cleared
away most of the clouds that had boon hang
ing over the Cuban political situation. La
Luclm , alone among the papers , still favors
a civil governorship.
General Collazo sajs"Tho message will
pacify the country. President McKlnley's
stntcmontn nro not very concrete , but If con-
fcrcfrfl guarantees the Independence of Cuba
wo need not ask for nny specification as to
the time for the removal of the American
trcops , although everybody would bo glad
to see the black troops go , because of the
excesses they commit. "
Gualbcrto Gomez said : " 1 had expected
the message to bo encouraging , but 1 had
not expected such clearness of thought. Con
gress will go further and will justify the
hope of the Cuban people. "
La Discussion says :
"President McKlnley's message will nil
the henrts of nil lovers of Cuba with Joy.
His words 'whatever bo the outcome wo
must sec to It that free Cuba bo a reality , pot
a name , ' should bo wrtlten In letters of
gold over the door of the Cuban white house.
The Cuban republic will bo bound to Lin
coln and McKlnley by Indissoluble bonds of
love. "
La Patrla says :
"Hurrah for President McKlnley ! Ho
could not have spoken In clearer tones. It
Is Impcsslblo for the giddiness of conquest
to overpower the deep , natural Impulse of
a noble and democratic people. "
La Cubano says :
"Tho message contains the clearest words
jet spoken by President McKlnley , nnd
shows that Justice la the guiding principle
at Washington. Our hearts , hitherto bowed
down by tremendous scepticism , nro now
relieved and wo may expect congress to
spcnk still more clearly. "

LONDON , Dec. 6. The amount of space
devoted here to President McKlnlej'e mes
sage to congress evidences the widespread
Interest in the document. The afternoon
newspapers , In long editorials on the subject ,
particularly refer to the currency declara
tions and solace themselves with the Idea
thnt the good relations between the United
States and Great Britain are so well known
as not to have required emphasis ail In the
case of Germany.
The Pall Mall Gazette sees In the message
nn unmistakable reproof of Mr. Chamber
lain's Leicester speech.
The Globe thinks the dosumont Is weak
In higher statesmanship nnd thnt on foreign
policy , as elsewhere , It Is tinctured vvlth'op-
portulsm.
The Westminster Gazette , discussing the
reference to Canada , says : "When dlscuss'ng '
the relations between Great Britain nnd the
United States It ought always to be remem
bered that there are very material Interests
which must bo dealt with on buslnea and
not on sentimental grounds. Graceful con-
cesslo'ns are not seen In the same light by
the daughter as by the mother. "

DERLIN , Dec. fi. The message gent to
congress yesterday by President McKInley
has been most sympathetically received by
newspaper and government circles in Ger
many. This Is especially tiuo of the foreign
office , ono of tbo highest olllclals of which
told the representative of the Associated
Press that the document had made a splen
did Impicsslon , adding that the distinctively
warm tone of the message will tend In an
Important manner to deepen nnd strengthen
the friendship of the itwo countries ma
terially and remove dlfllcultles In the set
tling of the meat and sugar questions still
ponding.
iierr uarin , in tno Nation , win say : "Tno
most Important thing In the message for tbo
economic Interests of the world Is the propo
rtion to put the United States more squarely
on the gold standard. It IB the lact kick
to bimetallism. "
The National Zeltung says : "President
McKlnley's words , In referring to Germany ,
plainly show n favorable revulsion of senti
ment toward us. In Germany the friendly
words of the American president will be
appreciated nt their full value. Germany
also earnestly drslreo to maintain the bcht
relations with the United States nnd the
full ot lojnlty and friendship In economically
competing. "
Different Comment * In 1'nrln.
PARIS , Dec. C , The Temps says It finds
"want of decision in President McKinley's
message , which must bo disconcerting for
the country , which needs un unequivocal ,
linn statement. "
Referring to the paragraph on foreign
nffalis , the Temps says. "After Mr. Cham-
bcrlaln It was President McKlnley's turn
nnd ho has shown himself tactful. Ho
speaks warmly of friendship , but does not
breuthu n word of alliance Thfbo uro
shades of language which say much for the I
fragility ot the ties of sentiment between
the two countries. His allusion to the fail
ure to reach an agreement with Canada
Is very clear. Alliances may be talked of ,
but a difference of secondary Importance i
cannot bo settled amiably. Referring to
South Africa , McKInley held the balance
level between the two belligerents nnd even
inflicted on Mr. Chamberlain nml the pre
tentious Imperialists the cruel word 'me
diation. ' In short , the message will little
please the noLsy champions of alliance ,
which It Ignores , whllo It will give satisfaction -
faction to nil wlso friends of a good under
standing between the two great Anglo-
Saxon nations. "
The Llberto says : "Wo cannot but congratulate -
gratulato ourselves on the good feeling
shown toward us by President McKlnley.
France Is alwajs ready to promote commerce
and Industry between the two republics. "

BETTER DAYS FOR THE HORSE
Hia Plnco in tbo Schftn * of Modern Lifo
Steadily Improving.
MORE STYLE AND LESS DRUDGERY
Monily Driiintiil tnr tlio Hr t
Inferior AnliimU HlnorcilUotl
nlllciiiit rontiiroH of tbe
York Slum.
This year's horse show In New York is , of
ficially , the fifteenth annual exhibition of the
National Horse Show association , reports
Harper's Weekly. If the forebodings ot
Homo of the prophets who hnve lately fore
cast the future of the horse are well founded ,
the horse show must be a decaying Institu
tion , and the moil fragile of us may 'expect
to see the last of It. Meanwhile It given
no convincing evidences of decrepitude. No
doubt , as n social appliance for the exhibi
tion of persons ot high fashion to one an
other and the general public It culminated
some years ago , but as a show of horses It
continues to do well. At the auction sale
of boxes for the present show , the other
day , $17,100 was realized , which Is better
by more than $1,000 than last } ear's show-
Ing. Probably the total receipts of this
j car's show will reflect In due measure the
boisterous prosperity of the country.
Kvery year more and moro of the world's
heavy drudgery Is done by machinery. In
Innumerable things machinery does the work
that used to fall to human muscles. The
hodcarrler Is growing obsolete ; the donkey-
engine now carries up the brlcka and the
steam drill pounds holes In the rocks ; but
there aio more men than ever , and ap
parently more work for them to do. What
machinery does In the end Is not to crowd
men out of employment , hut to lighten the
work of their hands and muscles nnd call
for increased activity In their minds. Ma
chinery , wo hope , Is helping to lift up the
great mass of humanity by making lite
easier tor it and making possible a fuller
reward for Its labors. It IB doing an analo
gous work for the horse. In that It encour
ages processes of selection which are rais
ing the general average of home Intelli
gence and ability. We must expect , as elec
tricity and steam and gasoline and com
pressed air are more nnd more used to
propel all sorts of vehicles , that the num
ber of horses In the world will diminish.
That Is where the case of man nnd that of
the horse may differ , for we do not look
to see fewer men on the earth , however
much work may be done by coal. Out the
number of horses is directly determined by
the demand for them , and it cannot bo
doubted that the demand for horses of in
ferior quality has already decreased.
nnnliiK the Uurdeii.
For purposes of carriage and transporta
tion , coal nnd Its extracts are a prodigious
success. In so far as they release the horsy
from the work of hauling public vehicles of
every sort , they do him a good turn and
benefit creation. If our children never see
a horse strain at the tugs to start a loaded
street car , so much the better , both for hu
manity and equlnlty. Whenever the mouth
ot the horse ceases to be sawed by the reins
that descend from the roof of the hansom-
cab , so much the better. We need not even
mourn the disappearance ot the truck-
horse , though at bis best he Is a fine , Intel
ligent creature and , In good hands , must
lead a happy life. All the horses that are
driven by butcher boys and grocers' boys
and that haul express wagons and delivery
wagons we can part with without a sigh ,
unless It Is n sigh" of relief at their release
from labor that is apt to be Ignominious and
harassing.
What wo cannot snare , and what there Is
no present sign that we ever will spare , Is
the horse's personal Qualities and his beauty.
As the companion of man ho would be fit ID
be cherished even If there wore no work
left for him to do ; but there Is , and always
will be , a great work for him to do in giv
ing health and pleasure to man. Machinery
can beat him In speed and certainty and en
durance , can supplement him and often take
his place ns a minister to our pleasures , but
It cannot equal him in personal beauty and
Interest. Ho hns style ; ho has life ; ho has
affection and sense and a disposition. In
those characteristics the creature ) that God
made will always bo unrivalled by any dev -
v Ice of man.
AutOlllOllllOd.
Automobiles will supersede the horse with
many persons even for purposes of display
and pleasure. They are full of the promise
of usefulness to humanity. A good many
folks to whom every horse is n wild beast
feel much safer on -machine than behind a
quadruped , who has a mind ot his own , nnd
emotions which may not always be fore
stalled or controlled. Certainly there Is a
great future for these machines , but they
will not altogether take the place of the
horse. Horse lovers may claim that they
are Imperfectly educational , since swapping
them or selling them can hardly deve'op
such mental acuteness as does dealing In
horses. Perhaps they are moral , and make
up in that direction a part of what they
luck as engines of sport. That the horsa
is of good repute as a promoter of morality
can linrdly be claimed even by his best
friend. The aleatory quality In him which
delights the sportsman will perhaps always
be the moralist's despair. Even In the
country , where ho Is the - ad
junct of agriculture nnd hauls the parson's
buggy , ho does not cease to be a gamble ;
and his speed , his obvious merits , his roon-
dlte defects and Inseparable uncertainties ,
are as liable to strain the rural consclenco
as they are to sharpen the rural wltn. It Is
not the horse's fault , and we should not
shun him for It. Horse nature Is geol
enough , and if It brings out some weak
.points In human nature It Is as well for our
consciences to have their proper exercise
and be kept In training. We pray not to bo
led Into temptation , but wo may well mean j
such temptation as Is bejond our strength.
Wo should not bo content with a rectitude
bo collapsible that wo dare not own a horse
that can go a mile In less than three minutes I
or Jump a fence more than forty Inches I
high. If we really mistrusted the moral <
Influence of the horse as much as we some-1
times think we do , we should not want our
children to have equine companionship In' '
their childhood Yet that Is something Hint'
most parents covet for their children , nnd
It Is a great vindication of horse nature and
a great compliment to horses that It should
bo so.

It was In the newspapers the other day
that It was proposed to give Instruction
about the horse to the children In the pub- '
llu schoola of New York What the ultimate '
aim of It was Is not hero recalled to teach '
'
them to he kind to animals , perhaps but ,
at any rate , It recognized that it Is good for ,
children to Know horscB , nnd It was on
many accounts a good suggestion To ho i
a fair Judge of n linrte Is very well worth
while The knowledge It Implies Is power |
In Its way. for certainly every perbon who i
knnns her e feels himself superior In that' '
particular , and something more , to folks I
who don't. It Is an Important source of I
pleasure , too , nnd of pleasure that Is cheap j
nnd constant. In the strcetH of New York |
there Is a horse show , and a great one ,
In progress eight months In the jear. Every
observer whose HOIISO of merit and beauty
In horses has been tialned observe * In
stinctively every horse that passes , and
gets a momentary pleasure from every good
one ho sees To go through life without
Interest In homes and without appreciation
I of the peed points of Rood ones Is n wnilo
of boi'iitlful opportunity which no thrlftv
person should endure. The most useful of
fice of the horse shows Is to teach people to
underataml about horses and know good
horses when they see them. The compnrl-
sons and competition of the shows result
In Improving the breeds ot all sorts of
horses , nnd that Is Important , too Hut If
we nro right In our self-concelted opinion
that the promotion ot human happiness Is
the end of nil the brute creation , It Is
even more Important thnt the capacity of
men to appreciate nnd delight In horses
should be enlarged than 11 Is thnt the
standard of equine beauty should be ralsr l
Hut the promoters of horse shows need not
consider whether It Is more In the Interest
of men or of horses thnt they work , so
long as their labors promote both

The "fury of \\oman scorned" Is often
spoken of ns something to bo feared , but ,
Judging from a tragedy enacted In Minne
apolis , it Is not In It with the nnger ot n
common cat when It realizes thnt the place
It once filled In the affections of Its owner'
has been taken by another nnd perhaps prct-
tier cat.
Old Dick , n big jellow cat , Is the property
of an east side joung woman , lelates the
Minneapolis Times , and for a number ot
months past has been the whole thing
around the house , so far ns pets were con-
ccrned. He had his own dish for milk , his
own rug and was a pretty lucky feline , take
It any way you would. His favorite resting
place wns In the lap of his mistress , nnd
when she recently brought home n little gray
kitten of which hc made much Old Dick
mnnlfested his displeasure In a variety of
ways.
His disposition seemed to change and In
stead of following his mistress nround the
house , as ho had been In the habit of doing ,
he simply turned his back upon her. Sev
eral times the young woman caught the old
fellow In the act of cutting the now arrival
and for this she reproved him sharply.
Finally the little kitten was unmolested
when the mistress was nround , but the old
cnt manifested his anger In other directions
Yesterday morning the joung woman had
the kitten In her lap petting It and calling It
endearing names when Old Dick entered the
room. He begnn to growl when ho saw the
tenderness with which the kitten wns
treated nnd then tried to Induce the young
woman to pet him Instead of the kitten.
His attempt wns a failure , however , nnd
then the old cnt went almost wild with rage.
With a single bound he was In the Inp ot
the young woman , who lest her presence ot
mind nnd begnn to scream , fearing the old
cat was about to attack her. Seizing the
kitten by the back Old Dick jumped to the
floor nnd , holding the kitten down by his
front paws , deliberately tore open the llttlo
animal's neck , killing It In a tow seconds.
As soon ns the kitten was dead the old cat
looked at the body for a moment and then
disappeared through the open door and hns
not been seen since.
The tragedy was clearly the result of an
ger on the part of Old Dick , who up to the
present time had never been known to get
into a quarrel with another cat. In fact ho
was so gentle that his name wns a s > nonym
for nil that was gentle and mild and his be
havior can be explained on no other theory
than that ho was driven Insane by jealousy ,
