-pHE CATHEDRAL of Mexico City,
X originally consecrated as the
Church of the Asuncion de Maria
Santlslma. and known as the Holy
Metropolitan church of Mexico, is the
largest ecclesiastical structure on the
American continent and third largest
in the world.
History says the foundation is com
posed almost wholly of sculptured In
dian images, placed there by the
builders as a token that Christianity
was obliterating the Idol worship of
tne Axtecs. The building is of basalt
and gray sandstone.
The cornerstone was laid in 1573
and it was not until 167 that It was
completed and inaugurated, but even
at that time the towers had not been
finished. They were not completed
until 1731. The towers alone are re
puted to have cost (190. 00 and the
rest of the structure S1.7S2.000.
The cathedral is on the exact site of
the first Catholic church erected in
Mexico, the original church forming
the atrium of the present cathedral.
The first church was completed in
lftza, so Mexicans date the cathedral
from that date, as the original church
is a part of the cathedral, making it
266 years in the building.
The chnrch is one of the most
elaborately decorated in the world,
the most elaborate in America. All
the earrings about the main altar and
in many other portions of the build
ing are of cedar, the carving by hand,
covered with solid gold leaf, and
they are as bright today as the day
they were erected, Each of four
Louis, kings of Spain, is said to have
contributed to the building of this;
altar, which bears statues of all of
them.
A black spot at the base of the
western tower marks the spot where
tne Aztec calendar stcne was located
when Mexico was the home of a pre
Historic civilisation. The great sacrl
ficial stone, where humans were sac
rificed by the thousands to rppease
tee anger or a pagan God, stood near'
by. it is generally believed.
One of the altars in the cathedral
is devoted to the martyrs of Mexico
and in it are preserved the bones of
many of the notable men of the early
days of its history as a Christian na
tion. Including the first semperor
rturblde
Many private altars are maintained
inside the cathedral, one of them, now
loci ed, belonging to the widow of the

cathedral. The chalice and many of
tne otner rexics in goto disappeared
during the reform wars, when Benito
Juarez separated the church from toe
statf. Public officials are charged
by the church with having disposed
or them; on the other hand, many said
the clergy buried them or sent them
to Rome, inasmuch as the government
confiscated ail church property and
it was the desire to keep these in
possession of the church.

MRS. AGNES ORNER.
VSTIX, Texas. Dec. 7. A condi
L tional pardon was granted today
by acting governor Johnson to
Mrs. Agnes Oraer, of E! Paso, con
victed at El Paso in 1915 on the
charge of murder by poison of her
little daughter, Lillian, and given a
life term In the penitentiary.
Conditions nader which the par
den was granted are that Mrs.
Oraer leaves HI Xao and does
not .go baeU there.
This is quite a noted case In that
it had been tried six times. In the
first trial, at El Paso. Urs. Orner
was given 99 years in the peniten"
tiary. while four of tbe trials which
were held at other places than El
Paso, all resulted In hang Juries.
Ten Year In Priaen.
The last time the case was tried,
in 1915, a life sentence was imposed.
The crime for which Mrs. Orner
was convicted occurred at El Paso In
1911 and before she reached the peni
tentiary she had served 5 years in
Jail and bss also served virtually five
years In the state penitentiary.
In recommending the pardon, tbe
board of pardons was divided. Judge :

SANTIAGO. Chile, Dec 7. Chilean
newspapers did not expect that
tne 4V year old dispute between
Chile and Pern for possession of the
territory of Tacna and Arlca wonld
be taken np by the league of nations
assembly at its first meeting m Ge
neva this month.
(Bolivia and Pern had requested
the league of nations to revise their
treaties with Chile. Bolivia, wanted
access to the sea and Pern wanted a
reconsideration, of the Tacna-Ariea
agreement; bnt both these requests
were withdrawn early In the session,
thns preventing the possibility that
the league might encroach noon the
Monroe docuine by considering those
American questions in the absence of
the United States.)
Newspapers here expressed belief
that the leagne of nations would not
touch any American questions until
It was decided whether the United
States would enter tbe league and
under what conditions. . . .
El Diarlo Ilustrado said:
"What does the problem of Tacna
and Arlca proposed by our northern
neighbors signify to the society of
nations9 It has waited years and
can wait longer without any ill re
sulting to the world and to America.
As soon as it la seen Its solution is
not simple because our country asks
the application of a treaty (the treaty
of Ancon) and Peru does not ish to
recognize it the question would be
postponed until a less pressing time
In world affairs.' The newspaper ex
pressed the opinion that it would be
very difficult for the league to at
tempt even "the initiation of consid
eration of American affairs without
the conoarrence of the United States.
An Interesting point not generally
known In connection with Chile's
preference to the league of nations ts
that It carried this reservation: "The
government of Chile reserves the
right of considering modifications or
reservations to the pact that may be
made by nations signatory to the
-treaty of Versalles and which have
nor ratified it np to the present. The
date thus referred to was November
4. 191. This reservation would leave
the opportunity open for Chile to
adopt reservations subsequently made
by the United States.

Has Tabere-Bloeis.
Mrs. Orner was pardoned on the
ground that she is suffering from
tuberculosis.
The woman was tried first at El
Paso in 1911. when J. M. Nealon was
district attorney. When her convic
tion was reversed, she was granted a
change of venue and was tried suc
cessively at Midland. Marfa, Pecos
and Van Horn and then the case -was
brought bach to El Paso, after the
Junes had failed to convict her in
each of the other trials. W. W.
Bridge rs was district attorney the
last time she waa tried, and secured
her conviction.
The Alleged Crimes.
On February 18, 111. Lillie Cor

mother, who lived at COS North
Ochoa street, was arrested on a
charge of murder and after a pre

McCllntock. remanded to Jail without
bond to await action of the grand
Jury.
On July 27. 1910. after an illness of
six hours, the child's father. Alfred

the same manner. On August 9. 1910.
Mrs. Orner was arrested on a charge

prove its purity and its spiritual
power to prevail. It is surely the
manifest destiny of the United States
to lead in the attempt to make this
spirit prevail "
Two ways "in which the United
States can assist to accomplish this
great object," were outlined by the
president. They were:
"First, by offering the example
within her own borders of the will
and power of democracy to make and

GERMAN CONDITIONS SERIOUS

PARIS, France, Dec 1. Something
of the seriousness of Germany's
economic condition, from a French
velwpolnt Is told by Jean Herbette,
foreign editor of Le Temps, now
studying the situation la Germany.
Members of the middle class, whose
stationary incomes spell poverty la
mo n.e oi prices ana tne workers,
are said by him to be particularly
unhappy." Fortunately, he adds,
farmers are prosperous.
Necessities Almost Luxuries.
"There Is cruel misery." he writes,
"in the homes of workers who have
many children. This condition is not
limited to families of tbe unemployed,
of whom there are 400.111)9 In Ger
many. It Is characteristic of the
present crisis that a workman cannot
manage to feed and clothe bis family,
even when he works at relatively
high wages.
"I have been in homes where the
father got SOS to 250 marks a week.
When he must feed five or six chil
dren. It is destitution. To buy bread,
fats and potatoes, even in Insufficient
quantities, he must spend 80 marks
a week or more. Rent, gas and a
little coal absorb part of tbe remain
der. How can the family be clothed or
shod? Even a poor suit costs 1500
marks, a pair of shoes 150 to 100
marks. Linen has become almost un
attainable luxury."

"unhealthy propaganda has free

In them and there must be found some
