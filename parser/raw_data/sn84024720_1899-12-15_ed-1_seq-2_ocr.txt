Harrisonburg is after the Republi

We are anxious to know how the
Republican leaders are going to explain
their position on the money question.
A few years ago that party was con
demning the Democrats for their acts
against silver; in 1896 they declared
for bimetallism, and this year are sol
idly for the gold standard. An hum
ble follower findß it impossible to keep
up with the frequent changes and it
must be annoying to keep explaining
to friends why he is one thing one year
and another tbe year following.
There is considerable complaint re
garding the street car tracks in this
city. It is alleged that horses are
shocked by stepping on the rails, and
in many places the tracks are so far
above the street bed as to annoy per
sons driving along the streets used by
the street railway company. The
street committee should look into this
matter and see if some improvement
cannot be made. This thing of having
horses shocked by stepping on the
rails is no laughing matter. People
without the protection of shoes would
also suffer. Let it be investigated.

It is evident that the present legis
lature intends to earn the reputation
of being a working body.—Lynchburg
News.
Its meeting at 12 o'clock and ad
journing in le6S than one hour is, in
our opinion, poor evidence. Just
think of 140 men being paid out of the
public treasury $4 daily for one hour's
work. Our Legislature makes a mis
take in losing so much time at the
begiuniug of the session, and this is
the direct cause of so much hasty and
unwise legislation.

The mercantile reports of last Sat
urday say business continues wonder
fully large, prosperous and healthy.—'
Tazewell Republican.
That is nothing unusual, they aTe
always rosy, but from the same city
where these reports are written comes
a letter to a Virginia firm saying that
"the unpromising aspect of all busi
ness—tbe financial stress—and the
fact that there is no prospect of im
provement, prevent any further en
largement of orders in your line." We
have little faith in these reports, es
pecially in cases of this kind when
they say business is good and a busi
ness firm says it is poor. The business
man ought to know. If our contem
porary had said itself what he says
the "reports" said, we would have had
more confidence in the statement.
DECLINES TO BE A DEMOCRAT.
In a recent issue of The Spectator
appeared an interview with ex-Senator
John M. Palmer, of Illinois, which
was taken from and credited to the
Washington Post. In the said inter
view Mr. Palmer was quoted as favor
ing the nomination of the Hon. Wm.
J. Bryan and predicting bis election.
We published it and commented upon
it editorially with the belief that it
was true, but Mr. Palmer sajs other
wise and we append herewith his
statement, which is taken from a letter
from him to Isaac M. Bush, of Michi
gan. He says:
My Dear Sir: I have read your favor
of December 1, 1899. I have never
seen the interview to which you al
lude and do not know what it contains,
but a real interview took place when I
was in Washington recently, in which
1 said that Mr. Bryan would be nomi
nated by the Democratic convention,
and that with him as its candidate,
the free silver issue could not be con
cealed, and that 1 would not support
him, and I did not predict his election.
I find that the Free Silver Republicans
entertain the same views that I do. I
That on the issue of 16 to 1 Mr. Bryan's '
opinions are known and cannot be I
glossed over. Bryan will lose Illinois
by 100.000 votes in my opinion. No I
Gold Democrat will vote for him here. I
John M. Palmer. I
Following the first mentioned inter-'
view we took occasion to welcome Mr. i
Palmer into Democratic ranks, but it I
seems he would not have it that way. I
All that is now left us is to baud him
over to the Republican party. They I
can take him and use him as they see
fit, but we would advise tbem to keep
one eye on him as he is a fellow who
is apt to bolt at a critical period. ,
Farewell John M. and may the bless ',
logs of McKinley rest upon you as it ,
at present rests upon Josiah Patterson ,
and Billy Bynum. ,
IN REPUBLICAN KENTUCKY.
The virtuous press, which of course
is tbe Republican press of the coun
try, has now an escape valve through
which its virtue can vent itself in the
opportunity given by the burning of a
negro murderer in Kentucky. This is
horrible of course. Killing in any
shape is horrible, especially so with
some when the victim is a negro, or
when done by the public in retaliation
for some murder or other outrage com
mitted by the person hanged, burned
or otherwise disposed of. It is not
very horrible for a negro to outrage
aud murder a white woman. We re
member no sycophantic moralizer of
Republican faith, especially of that
faith whose habitation is north of
Mason and Dixon's line or w« st of the
Ohio river, who seems to regret such
au occurrence, but in those quarters
there is more gush about the killing
Of a negro unless it occurs at an Illinois
coal mines, than any other occurrence
of modern times. We are used to such
gush, it does not blight, iv fact it does
not so much as leave any mark of
devastation in the quarter at which it
is aimed, it only illustrates that guilty
people are the first to condone what
others do. The penitentiaries are full
of people who see nothing wrong in
what they did to place them there, but
who inform us that judge and jurors
who sat in their case were criminals
of the blackest dye. We are told that
it is inhuman to burn any one alive,
and we admit the fact, but the grand
sires, if they had such, of most of our
"W r oolly" Western contemporaries,
helped to hang Indians unless they
were too cowardly to go to the fron
tiers. The grandsires of many of our
down Eastern contemporaries burnt
women for no crime at all, and yet
they find it oh ! so horrible to burn a
negro rapist or murder when done in
the South. We are told that if we
commit the least sin in this life we
are to burn forever and ever in the
next. If this be true the kindling of a
fire about a murderer a few moments
before the fires of hell begin his eternal
and everlasting roasting is not a thing
which those Christian communities of
the North and West need picture as so
very horrible. Such deeds as burning
by many people are much to be de
plored, but we cannot see why the
mob is worse than the individual mur
derer. We have no sympathy with
mob violence, but after a man has
murdered anybody, especially an inno
cent woman, his manner of taking off
shall cause us few pangs. It is well to
note that this mode of death in Ken
tucky has only been adopted since the
State became "Safely Republican."

Good Earnings of Southern Railways.
The gross earnings of the railroads of
the U. S. in November were $17,648,
--978, a gain of 8.2 per cent, on the same
month last year, and 18.4 per cent,
better than in November, 1892. Tak
ing the leading systems of railroad in
the various sections of the country to
gether for comparison, Dun's Review
finds the Southern, Central Western
and Granger roads making the best
showing of gains. The Southern roads
in the first half of November averaged
again of $365,165, or 9 9 per cent, over
the first half of November, 1898, being
excelled only by the Grangers, with a
gain of 12.7 per cent, and the Eastern
roads, exclusive of the trunk lines,
with a gain of 14.7 per cent. The
Southwestern roads gained but 2.8 per
cent, and the Pacific but 2.1 per cent.
Tbe greatest gain was that of the
Canadian roads, namely, 15.1 per cent.
The increased iron business o£ tbe
South is said to have increase largely
the earnings of the Southern Railway
and the Louisville and Nashville.

SENATOR MARTIN'S EASY VICTORY.
Action of Democratic Caucus-Captain
Holt and Judge Letcher Also Win.
In tte caucus of Democratic mem
bers of the legislature held Thursday
night of last week after The Specta
tor had been printed, lion. Thomas S.
Martin was re-nominated on the first
ballot for the United States Senate to
succeed himself.
His only opponent was Governor J.
Hoge Tyler, the vote being Martin,
102; Tyler, 28.
Mr. Martin received almost the vote
claimed for him several months ago.
The most significant feature of the
contest was the definite knowledge
Senator Martin has manifested of his
strength.
The Senator's name was placed be
fore the caucus by Senator Mcllwaiue,
of Petersburg. The speaker eulogized
his candidate as one of the ablest and
best representatives Virginia bas had
in the upper branch of the national
Congress.
Senator Foster, of Norfolk, one of
the oldest members of the legislatuie,
seconded Mr. Martin's nomination.
George Wayne Anderson, of Rich
mond, made an eloquent speech second
ing Mr. Martin's nomination, in which
he paid a glowing tribute, as did all
his predecessors, to the ability and
purity of character of his candidate.
Governor Tyler's name was placed
before the caucus by Delegate Pollock,
of Pulaski, the home county of the
candidate. This gentleman presented
the claims of the governor In well-timed
sentences of praise, in which he briefly
reviewed that gentleman's services to
the State and party.
The governor's nomination was sec
conded by Senators LeCato, of Ac
comac, and Blakey, of Essex.
Before the announcement of the re
sult of the ballot Senator LeCato, a
representative of the governor, moved
to make the nomination unanimous.
This,however, was strenuously resisted
by Senator Martin's friends, who insist
ed upon the announcement of the vote
and a showing of the actual strength
of the two candidates. This was done.
After the result of the roll call had
been announced, on motion of Senator
LeCato the vote was made unanimous.
After nominating Senator Martin,
the caucus nominated all of the heads
of State departments, except that of
register of land office, which went over.
All the incumbents were renominat
ed without opposition except Super
intendent of Printing O'Bannon. The
latter was opposed by L. E. Lookabill,
of Roanoke. The vote was 82 to 48 in
favor of O'Bannon.
These officers were renominated:
Secretary of Commonwealth Lawless,
Commissioner of Railroads Hill, Audi
tor of Public Accounts Marye, Second
Auditor Ryland, Treasurer Harman,
Superintendent of Penitentiary Helms.
There was a prolonged discussion
over the motion to put the office of re
gister of the land office on the !ist of
those to be nominated, but in couse
qence of a bill pending in the Senate
for abolishing this office, it was passed
by.
The following judges were nominat
ed: Corporation Court of Staunton,
Henry W. Holt; Lynchburg, F. P.
Christian; Portsmouth, John F. Croc
ker: Norfolk, Allan B. Hanckle; Rich
mond, S. B. Witt; Chancery Court,
Richmond, James C. Lamb; Law and
Equity Court, Richmond, E. C. Minor;
Petersburg Hustings Court, W. H.
Mullen.
Circuit Judges—S. H. Letcher, Thir
teenth Circuit; Geo. J.Hundley, Third;
H. A. W. Skeen, Seventeenth.
County Judges—Amherst, C. J.
Campbell; Franklin, John B. Lee;
Wise, W. H. Bond; Amelia, S. L.

GRAND CAMP REUNION
General Gordon Has Decided on May 30
and 31, and June I, 2 and 3. c
Adjutant General Morman, by direc
tion of John B. Gordon, commanding
United Confederate Veterans, has is •
sued the following: '
The general commanding announces
that under the custom establishad by (
the association, leaving the date of tbe (
next annual meeting and reunion, <
which is to be held in the city of Louis- ,
ville, Ky., to the general commanding
and the department commanders, by
unanimous agreement, tbe reunion
will be held upon the following dates: (
May 30th, 31st, and June Ist, 2nd, 3rd, (
1900, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday '
and Saturday, respectively, which dates
have been submitted to "Our Host" i
and acquiesced in.
On accouut of the rapid growth of l
the association, and the immense ac- i
cumulation of important business i
which will be presented to the dele
gates for their consideration, and .
which will demand your attention to
the coming session, four days will be
given for the business meetings, unless
Men matters are sooner disposed of, '
and as the grand Commonwealth of
Kentucky gave Mr. Jefferson Davis to
the Confederacy, and as Sunday, June
3, 1600, will be the ninety-second an- •
niversary of his birth, that day will be ;
specially set apart for religious and i
memorial services to be held in memory
of Mr. Davis, of the "Daughters of the
Confederacy" and of thousands of our
peerless-private soldiers and illustrious ;
commanders and leaders of the Con
federacy, who "have gone to join the
spectral armies encamped among the .
stars."
With pride the general commanding
announces that 1,240 camps have now
joined the association, and aprlication,
for organization papers received at
these headquarters for about two huu
red more.
He urges veterans everywhere to send
to those headquarters for organization
papers for more camps at once, and join
this association so as to assist in carry
ing out its benevolent, praiseworthy
and patriotic objects.
DR. TALMAGE'S FOUR WIVES.
He May Have the Same Trouble in the
Next World that Roberts has in This.
Editor Post: I read Dr. Talmage's
sermon against polygamy, published
in the Post last Monday. I am abso
lutely opposed to polygamy, but do
not agree with the views of the House
majority in the vote on the Tayler res
olution adopted Tueaday. Still, I am
overwhelmed by the Talmage view,
and submit eleven propositions, in a
somewhat disconnected manner. But
possibly the reader will see the point.
Here they are:
1. Polygamy is an abhorrent thing,
and Roberts should be hung.
2. Dr. Talmage's sermon (¥) pub
lished last Monday was the most elo
quent arraignment ot polygamy the
country has ever seen.
3. Dr. Talmage has charmed the
people in years gone by with the
thought that the good will meet their
loved ones on the other shore.
4. Hence, in the next, world, the
elect will know tbe bliss of family
reunions.
5. This is a blessed thought for the
pure in heart who travel through this
vale of tears.
6. If this is true, the programme
on earth is necessarily different from
that of heaven.
7. Roberts is said to have three
wives, two too many for earth, at one
time.
8. Dr. Talmage will cross the divide,
having lived in a consecutive manner
with four earthly wives.
9. This is lawful, and it is civiliza
tion oo earth.
10. But there must be reunions in
heaven.
11. Dr. Talmage may have the same
trouble in the next world that Roberts
has in this.

Deafness Cannot be Cured

Deafness is caused by an iniiamed con- I

imperfect hearing, and when it is entire

less the inflammation can be taken out
aud this tube restored to its normal con
dition, hearing will be destroyed for

by catarrh, which is nothing but an in

Pains, aches and rheu
matism come from ex
cess of uric acid in the
blood, due to neglected B
kidney trouble. ' s
Kidney trouble causes quick or unsteady 2
heart beats, and makes one fee! as though c
they had heart trouble, because the heart is n
over-working in pumping thick, kidney- a
poisoned blood through veins and arteries. 1
it used to be considered that only urinary I
troubles were to be traced to the kidneys, b
but now modern science proves that nearly if
all constitutional diseases have their begin- P
nir.g in kidney trouble. t<
if you are sick you can make no mistake
by first doctoring your kidneys. The mild d
and the extraordinary effect of Dr. Kilmer's il
Swamp-Root, the great kidney remedy is p
soon realized. It stands the highest for its fi
wonderful cures of the most distressing cases tl
and is sold on its merits tMf^mi
by all druggists in fifty- "
cent and one-dollar siz-ft.----

sample bottle by mail noma of swamp-Root,
