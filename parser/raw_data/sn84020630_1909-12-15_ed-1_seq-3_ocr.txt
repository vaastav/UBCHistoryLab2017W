some structures in thousands of com
munities and would give employment
to hundreds of thousands of men, the
sponsor for the idea 'being former
United States Senator William E. Ma
son of Chicago, who has knowledge of
the facts as he was chairman of the
postoffice committee in the United
States Senate. "In Chicago, for in
stance," said Senator Mason in a lettei
to Chairman Geo. H. Currier of the
Postal Savings Bank League which is
urging the enactment of a postal sav
ings bill during this session of Con
gress, "the government would be able
to save not less than a hundred thou
sand dollars a year by employing
funds deposited in constructing the
branch postoffice buildings which are
needed. The investment of say $G,000,
000 would cost in interest.at the 2 per
cent paid postal depositors, fully $100,
000 less than the rentals now paid.
Moreover it. would give employment
to thousands of men and put the mon
ey into circulation. There would be
similar economies in other cities and
towns." The problem of the invest
ment of deposits, which the hostile
banking interests have held up as a
bug-aboo against the postal bank plan
was one which President Taft in his
message to Congress dealt with de
cisively, saying: "I believe postal
savings banks to be necessary in order
t offer the proper inducement to thrift
and saving to a great many people of
small means who do not now have
banking facilities and to whom such a
system would offer an opportunity for
the accumulation of capital. The
question of how the money deposited
in postal savings banks shall be in
vested in not free from difficulty, but I
believe that a satisfactory provision
for this purpose was inserted as an
amendment to the bill considered by
the Senate at its last session." In a
bulletin issued by the Postal Bank
League it is said: "All members of
this league and all those who favor
ipostal banks are urged without delay
to make it their business to write eo
the members of the house sub-committee
on postoffice and postroads urging
that the postal bank bill as now per
fected be reported for action in Con-

zations and bar associations, commer

asked to affiliate or co-operate with
this Alliance for a united, well defined
plan. Active aid will be given by this
body to tin' Mann bill in Congress for
the new federal statute to which Presi
dent Taft referred tin his message to
Congress, saying: "1 greatly regret to
have to say that the investigations
made in the bureau of immigration aud
other sources ot information lead to
the view that there is urgent necessity
for additional legislation and gicattr
executive activity to suppress the re
cruiting of the ranks of prostitutes
from the streams of immigration into
this country an evil which, for want
of a better name, has been called 'the
white-slave trade.' believe it to ie
constitutional to forbid under penalty,
the transportation o peisoiis mi
poses of prostitution across national
and state lines, and b; appropriating
a fund of $.jU,m) to be used by the sec
retary of commerce and labor for the
employment of special inspectors it
will be possible to bring those respon
sible for this trade to Indictment and
conviction under a federal law." Ef
forts will be made to secure the enact
ment of new state laws by such legis
latures as convene this winter in states
where it is needed, as shown by the
investigation made by Assistant
United States District Attorney Harry
A. Parkin during the summer. A di
gest of the state laws of the country
on this subject has just been issued by
the Curlier Publishing Company in a
book, "War on the White Slave
Trade," which was the final work of
the Woman's World's committee, the
nucleus of the new national organiza
tion. Increasing Public Library Usefulness.
Increasing the usefulness of a pub
lic library by adding branch libaries
is the urgent recommendation of Chi
cago's Public Library Commission and
wealthy citizens are looked to for con
tributions for the uurpose. The need
of library extension work through
branches is declared to be serious. The
advisory commission was composed of
Harry A. Wheeler, president of the
Credit Clearing house; T. F. Hol
gate, dean of the College of Liberal
Arts in Northwestern University;
George K. Vincent, dean and professor
of sociology in the University of Chi
cago: N. D. C. Hodges, librarian, and
president of the American "Library As
sociation, and J. I. Wyer, Dr., director
of the New York State Library. It has
reported: "The earlier conception (of
a library) was that of a collection of
books covering as completely as pos-'
sible every department of knowledge
and literature, more stress being laid
upon having books than upon having
them used. The modern library idea is
to put the books as freely as possible
into the hands of the people." The
commission urges the use of the inter
est uuou the 5212,000 Endowment
Fund made up of gifts from private
parties, for the expansion of the li
brary service. This interest fund now
amounts to $30,000. It is also urged
that, a portion of the bonds, authorized
by the last legislature, should be de
voted to this work. The present "de
livery station" method is condemned.
Flim-Flam Game.
The marble, mahagony and porcelain
of the 'big city hotel, the bigger and
the finer the better, as a trap for the
confidence man's victim has another
black mark checked against it, the
sum of $4,875 having been secured
from an astute business man at the
LaSalle. The police are now wonder
ing how an entire, old-fashioned faro
layout could be smuggled into the La
Salle without the knowledge of the
management, hut John Dowdle, con
tractor, has admitted that fixed faro
was the way in which he was sepa
rated from his money among all the
elegances that could be expected to se
cure security. It is rather novel even
in a city where the wits of the "con
man" continually are giving birth t
something new in quick and easy
finance. Good clothes, fine address
and the supposed security of the hotel
lured Dowdle to the room of one reg
istered as Hawkins, who has been
identified also under other names.
Hawkins, it appears, arrived with
much baggage seevral days ago and
immediately afterward had many call
ers. When Dowdle "squealed" the
same outfit was found in Hawkins
room that is the main furniture of the
frontier gambling house, and all of the
gambling houses in between. It ap
pears ihat for years the faro "banker"
under his real name of Frank, was a
traveling salesman for a Chicago house
and made acquaintances whem he has
victimized later. He advertised for
"business men to invest $5,000 to $10,
000," introduced prospective investors
to a confederate and promptly suggest
ed a little game in which, as it was
crooked but looked respectable, the
"prospective investor" stood no
chance whatever.
Fight on Telephone Trust.
Another siee of the Bell telephone
stronghold, Chicago, has been declared
by the International Independent Tele
phone Association with the promise
that next Christmas will see competi
the serive. the sum of $50,000 being
the sum in hand to start the work, the
subscriptions of manufacturers of "in
dependent" telephone equipment and
supplies. The announcement is to sell
$1,000,000 of stock to members of the
association and President H. D. Critcli
fleld has said: "Contracts have been
sighed for the erection of a plant and
for the necessary details to provide
Chicago with an independent telephone
service. , I have had the article signed
and the contracts for the minor work
will be awarded next week and the in-

dependent service will b in Chicago in
a year. The sum of ?:.0,0(m has been
subscribed by individual concerns to
start the work." The Bell company's
in vestment, in Chicago now is about
$2u,uo(i,im0, there being over 200,000
telephones in service one to every 10
Inhabitants. In 1STS there was a tele
phone to every thousand people men,
women, children beins counted and
for years by hundreds of persons.
Curiously enough the manager of the
first telephone exchange, that of a Bell
company, was B. E. Sunny, who since
then has climbed, most of the time
with the General Eelectric Company,
until he not only is the president of
the Chicago Telephone Company, but
also a vice-president of the parent Bell
company, the "A. T. & T. Co." of Bos
ton which has now acquired the Gould
control of the Western Union Tele
giaph Company. The growth of the
Bell companies is taken to indicate a
preference of the public for one tele
phone company in a city, although the
huge profits at first enabled the Bell
companies to grow and expand.
BASKET BALL IS
POPULAR AT ALBUQUERQUE.
University Co-Eds Will Play Girls of
U. S. Indian School in Duke
City Friday,
Albuquerque, X. M., Dec. 15.
What promises to be one of the most
interesting and hotly contested bask
etball game played in Albuquerque in
a long time, will occur at. Casino hall
at Traction park Friday night, when
the United States Indian school girls
will play the University of New Mex
ico in the first of a series of three
games for the championship of the
season.
The Indian maidens are pretty
much of an unknown outntity this
year. It is understood that they have
some clever individual players and
are strong on team work and the
fans are not giving odds on either
team, preferring to wait until the
night of the game to choose a winning
six. The Varsity girls have already
demonstrated the strength of their
team this season by defeating the Y.
M. C. A. girls some two weeks ago.
Because the game is at the park and
will be necessary for those who jour
ney to the game to Invest ten cents
In car fare, Manager John Abbott of
the Varsity team has made a special
twenty-five cents admission price. A
dance with good music will follow the
game.
MADE A RECORD
THRESHING GRAIN.
Sine- 1872 Threshed Nearly Two Mil
lion Bushels, Making a Profit
of $28,427.
Spokane, Wash., Dec. 13. Statistics
co.i-plled from a personal diary kept
by A. W. Busby, a pioneer thresher
man and rancher in Kittitas county,
Wash,, west of Spokane, show that he
has threshed a total of 1,920,033 bush
els of grain since 1872, as follows:
Wheat 804,752; oats 517,u04; barley,
398,257. His earnings are placed at
$75,822,89, with expenses at $47,495.-
72, leaving a profit of $28,427.17. He
has operated from one to three
threshing machines since 1903, and in
that time threshed 266.8S4 bushels of
grain, or an average of 44,884 a year
The machines were operated 226 -days
during the six years,, the average prof
it being more than $750 for a season
of 37 1-2 days. It is estimated that
Busby has threshed approximately 50
per cent of the grain grown in the
Kittitas valley during the last 37
years, since which time, he reports,
there has never been a crop failure.
He is preparing to increase his forces
in 1910, when he expects to do com
mercial threshing in the districts ad
joining Kittitas county.
