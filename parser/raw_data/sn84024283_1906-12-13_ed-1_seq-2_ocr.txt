'Commander Peary has the American

It is given out that he will make an

In his last venture he went within 200

Caliptt received medical treatment in
the shape of a bucket of castor oil.
Like 99 per cent, of humanity, Caliph
has an aversion to castor oil. A wedge

that the college had been free of those
rougher forms of hazing which, unfor
tunately, had existed in sister colleges,
such as putting the girls under the
pump, standing on their heads and
tearing off their clothes. But that

sell her old felt hat and buy a straw

one, and If she likes, buy a steak and
a salad for her dinner, a paper bag of
fried potatoes, sweets, and some flow

Icing here, and no more attention To
paid to the millionaire who is looking
for something marvelous, which he
may pick up cheap, than to the man
with the wooden leg who wants a new
left boot in exchange for a dozen ear
dine tins, fine gloves and a stocking."

AN AWFUL STORY OF CRIME.
Evidence of Wholesale Poisoning In
Chicago for Inaurance.
Chicago, 111. The police Investi
gation into the deaths ot the six mem
bers of the Vzral family have de
veloped the fact that, a proposition to
secure money by poisoning was enter
tained by Mrs. Rose Vzral. who was
supposed to have committed suicide
last Tuesday, and Herman Belek, the
palmist, suspected of having adminis
tered poison to Martin Vzral and the
tatter's four children. The evidence
that such a proposition was considered
is in the form of a letter from Mrs.
Vzral to ' Belek, asking that he se
cure money for her in return for what
she had given him. by noisonlne his
own mother, who lives in Cleveland,
u. When questioned; Bdlek admitted
that the request was made, not onlv
that he should poison his mother, but
tnat he should take the life of his
wife by the same means. Belek's
statement was confirmed by Mrs.
Belek, who said thafsfie had been in
constant fear of her life because of
the Jealousy Mrs. Vzral and her daugh
ter entertained against her.
On the strength of the letter A. war.
rant embodying a direct charge of
nuraer against Belek and his wife
were sworn out before Judge .Maxwell,
jefore whom they will be taken for a
