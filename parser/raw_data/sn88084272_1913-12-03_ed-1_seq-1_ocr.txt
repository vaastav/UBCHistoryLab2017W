VL That a crisis in Mexico has al-

the numerous armies the rebels have
In the field, is the general belief pre
vailing in Washington.
The state department continues its
-watchfulness in the .campaign of the
Mexican insurgent leaders. It is point
ed out in official circles that at the
present time the "Constitutionalists"
appear to be in actual possession of
more country and to have more nu
merous armies in the field than Madero
did when he received notice of the
overthrow of Pofirio Dihz.

American legations and embassies

Panics Will Cease if Gov

GOVEENMENT AID
GIVEN TO FAEMERS
WASHINGTON. D. O, Dec 3.
Government intervention to
avert financial panics is de
fended by secretary McAdoo, of the
treasury department, in his report to
congress, submitted today.
Mr. McAdoo details the treasury's
offer to loan bank ot the country
money to move the fall crops. -The
gam of $46,590,000 out of $50,MM,e es
timated to be needed, was apportioned
among the states.
"It was oaaontial." sse the secretary,
"that the action of the department
Should be non-partisan and non-political;
the crops of Republicans, Demo
crats and "Progressives" and all other
classes of people had to be moved, and
the earnest effort of the department
was to have the benefits of this ac
tion diffused as widely and impartially
as possible."
After praising the psychological
value of these incidents, the report con
tinues: "They demonstrate clearly that any
Improvement in our financial system
which will permanently establish con
fidence will in itself be an immense
gain, and if that improved financial
system assures the Opportunity to se
cure at ail times the necessary funds
and credits to meet the exoandintr and
legitimate needs of the commerce and j
industry or tne country, it will be an
achievement of enduring benefits.
Show Value of Altruistic Agency.
These incidents also show conclus
ively the enormous value of an altru
istic governmental agency in the finan
cial affairs of the country- So long
as the government has the power to
Intervene in a beneficent and unselfish
way. the danger of panic and of un
just practices will be largely, if not
wholly, destroyed.
"This is one of the chief objects
sought in the proposed reformation and
reorganization of our ban kins: and cur
rency system. The people of the coun
try are to be congratliiit-Hl upon the
early prospect of souni legislation on
this vitally important subject."
Of the new tariff act secretary Mc
Adoo savs it has not been in force a
sufficient length of time to make pos
sible an accurate estimate of its ulti
mate revenue producing powers.
Asks Tax on Alcohol.
He asks congress to impose a nomi
nal tax of one percent proof gallon on
all alcohol withdrawn fon denatura
tion and legislation requiring every
dealer in leaf tobacco to make an in
ventory of stock January 1 of each
year and make a report of his trans
actions quarterly or monthly, and that
every dealer be required 'to give bond.
The present oleomargarine law Is de
clared to be unsatisfactory and the gov
ernment is said to lose more taxes from
illicit practices in oleomargarine than
through moonshine stills. The differ
ence in the tax on colored and uncol
ored "oleo" Is held responsible for the
loss and congress is asked to impose
a flat nominal tax without any differ
ence for color with provision for In
dividual stamped or original packages
of certain sizes adequately marked and
safeguarded. The law governing the
sale of adulterated butter is declared
to have brought about unfortunate con
ditions through the difficulty of its
just enforcement.
Some of the Recommendations.
Among his principal recommenda
tions to congress, the secretary placed

LEAVE CHIHUAHUA
TO THE REBELS
ELEVEN troop trains carried the
56(H) federal and irregular troops
and 3500 refugees out of Chihuahua-
on the Orient road Sunday en
route to Faiomir and from there oyer
land to Ojinaga, according to Carlos
Heberlein, who arrived at the border
Tuesday evening, with O. Hernandez,
who brought the message of the for
eign consuls to Villa. The federals, he
.ald,: would go to Nuevo Leon from
Ojinaga. Jir. rieoenein came in an au
tomobile to Villa Ahumada and from
there to Juarez on a rebel troop train.
The refugees should reach the border
this evening or Thursday.
He says that conditions were normal
in Chihuahua when he left there Sun
day evening. Frederico Moye was the
acting governor and there were 200
troops of the 6th federal regiment pa
troling the streets to preserve order.
In addition, there were 300 mounted-police
patroling the outside districts. No
one was being permitted to enter the
town from the outside until Villa ar
rived, and every effort was being made
to prevent disorders, pending the for
mal taking of the town by Villa,
Heberlein says. Heberlein says that
the only disorder was caused by some
of the irregular troops trying to loot
some of the stores before they left for
Ojinaga. He says that Mercado's pur
pose in evacuating Chihuahua was be
cause he had had no money with which
to pay the federal troops and he be
lieved that he could control them bet
ter out in the wilderness than in the
city, where there was danger of loot

to join the federal troops now holding
Monterey, Nueva Leon, Heberlein says,
although he expected to escort the
refugees to the border at Ojinaga be
fore atmpting any military move-,

"It will take three or more days to
make the trip to Ojinaga by way of
Faiomir." Mr. Heberlein said Wednes
day. "The bridges are burned east of
San Sostenes, where it will be neces
sary for the ti'bops to detrain. From
there to Faiomir is only a short dis
tance and from Faiomir it is 112 kilom
eters through La Mula pass to the
border. But the country is the worst
on the American continent; there is no
water and the refugees were warned
by Americans in Chihuahua not to at
tempt to take their women and children
across this desert, and many were left
behind, as they would be protected by
the foreign consuls. There were 5500
troops, including all of the forces in

"Huerta Regime Crumbling.'
The flight of Huerta's generals in
northern Mexico, federal evacuation of
Chihuahua and Guaymas and the re
fusal of Mexican oil companies to fur
nish fuel for the movement of federal
troop trains, were pointed out by of
ficials here today as suoh events to
which president Wilson referred In his
message to congress when he declared
the Huerta regime was crumbling "by
a little every day."
Diplomatically there have been no
developments. President Wilson's
statement that this government would
not, in his opinion, be obliged to alter
its policy of "watchful waiting" was
regarded as forecasting a period of
passive observation -with every eye of
the government exercising at the same
time a close scrutiny on behalf of
guarding foreigners and their prop
erty. Some diplomatists were inclined to
see in president Wilson's expression of
hopefulness that when Huerta had
been forced from power. In which or

Prima Donna Ties Tip Trains Here
"When She Insists Upon Ravins

Madame Schumann-Heink and her

union station in El Paso Tuesday
night "for 'over 45 mniutes. The diva

The prima donna, who has closed a

change cars in El Paso on her way to

doors of the baggage car wore a shade
too small for the piano, and it re
quired the working force of all the

Long Buried Vehicle Is Believed to

A big road wagon was discovered

in East El Paso Wednesday. Only the
rear wheels n-n1 tbft i-enr- nart of the
wagon have so far been uncovered. !
The wheels are apparently perfectly
good, though the wagon bed Is consia-
erably rotted. The wagon contains a l
load or semirotted tornnio. The sup
position among the workmen is that
the wagonload of tornillo was being
driven over from Mexico some years
before the river changed, that it struck
the quicksand and was swallowed up.
The situation of the wagon is about
500 yards form the old river bed. It is
headed for Texas. There is a great

"The year 1913 has been the best

Newell said "Wednesday. "This is In

"Instead of raising prices the land
owners raised crops this year and the

poses. This is being done throughout

xT'OU CAN TELL the people of the United States that we will sen3

was the farewell message of Gen. Pancho Villa as he waved goodbye
to Juarez at 2:20 oclock Wednesday afternoon and his train steamed south
ward for the city of Chihuahua, which he expects to occupy by Thursday night
without firing a shot.
Villa becomes the absolute dictator of Chihuahua, by the evacuation of
the state capital by the federals, and goes to the city to take charge, on invita
tion of the people and the foreign consuls.
PRECEDED BY MILITARY TRAIN.
Preceding the military train which bore Villa and his staff from Juarez
were two other military trains, carrying approximately 2100 cavalry, two
regiments of artillery and food supplies in big quantities. The first of these
trains, nearly a mile long, left Wednesday morning at 9:20 oclocL Ten can
non, under the command of Col. Manuel Bauche Alcalde, and 600 cavalry,
part of Gen. Toribio's brigade, were aboard it.
HOSPITAL CAR TAKEN.
An hour, later a second train, containing 37 cars, got under way with
more than 1000 cavalry aboard. Villa's train, besides carrying an escort of
500 men, was loaded with 10 cannon, under the command of LieutCol. Pablo
Cervin. A White Cross hospital car was also attached to this train.

Evacuation of ChiSnnhua.
That the evacuation of Chihuahua by
Huerta's federal army was agreed to
by Gen. Salvador Mercado and all his
generals, is the news that was brought
to Juarez Tuesday afternoon late by
Odilion Hernandez, who brought a let
ter to Gen. Francisco Villa, of the rebel
army, from all the foreign consuls in
Chihuahua, asking him to come to the
state capital at once and take charge.
The message also asked him to grant
amnesty to the federal soldiers left in
the city of Chihuahua.
Hernandez brought a copy of Gen.
Mercado's letter renouncing his au
thority over civil affairs In Chihuahua,
in which Gen. Mercftdo declares there
is no money to pay the Huerta troops
and that evacuation is necessary.
To Abandon AH of North.
The simultaneous evacuation of
other federal strongholds in the north
is believed by the rebels to be the re
sult of a concerted decision to abandon
the whole of northern Mexico. Gen.
Mercado's proclamation, which was
dated at Chihuahua, Nov. 26. reads:
"To Frederico Moye: It being neces
sary to leave this city with the forces
of my command, and accompanied by
the civil authorities because it so be
hooves the military operations, it is
necessary that I constitute a pro
visional authority that will see to the
observance of order and give guaran

are:

Gen. Marcello Caraveo.
Gen. Jose 'Manzllla.

Seeks Federal Amnesty.
The peace commissioner who brougb
Gen. Mercado's proclamation, proposet
to Gen. Villa for the foreign consuls that
all noncombatants who sought safety
by fleeing to the border be permitted
to go without being fired upon and
that all federals, especially the 204 sol
diers left on police duty in Chihuahua
city, be pardoned. It also asked clem
ency for federal officials, but it is
thought that the federal generals will
seek safety by crossing the border into
the United States, possibly near
Ojinaga.
No Money In Chlhnnhna.
The peace commissioner stated that
before leaving Chihuahua the federals
destroyed all the postage and govern
ment revenue stamps, that there ex
isted practically no money in the city
and that 3000 citizens had left with the
troops, most of the cltisens being those
who were rich and who feared harsh
treatment by the rebels.
The commissioner started back for
Chihuahua last night with Gen. Villa's
assurances that people of all classes
in the city and, including the federal
police, would be protected and that he
-would dispatch troops to garrison the
place as soon as possible.
Gen. Villa said Chihuahua would be
only a stopping place on his southward
march and he was determined to con
tinue on to Mexico City.
