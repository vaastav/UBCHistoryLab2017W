JSj?* The proceedings of the Legislature, and
the numerous new advertisements in this issue,
exclude a large amount of editorial and news
matter.

Western Hogs.
A drove of Tennessee hogs reached this place
on Thursday last. Many of our citizens sup?
plied their larders with fresh pork, sausage, et
cetera. The sales were made at 10 cents gross.
Election of Steward.
"We understand that the Board of County
Commissioners, on Saturday last, elected Mr.
John M. Brown to fill the place of Steward of
the Poor House for the ensuing year. The
salary to be ?aid is $275.00.
BS^We invite attention to the advertise?
ment of J. P. Reed, Esq., offering for sale or
rent the splendid property on the northwest
corner of the public square. It is eligibly lo?
cated, and has been thoroughly renovated and
repaired, and that portion intended for a hotel
is admirably arranged, with all the modern con?
veniences and appurtenances.
Stone & Murray's Circus.
The unique and entertaining performances of
this popular exhibition induces us to utter a
good word in it3 behalf. The creditable and
respectable exhibition on Tuesday last gained
universal commendation from the persons in
attendance. All of them were highly pleased,
and it was the unanimous verdict that this was
pre-eminently the best Circus which has visited
this section since the war. Excellent order
was maintained, and the most fastidious could
pot complain at the witticisms of the clown or
the general demeanor of the actors. The horse?
manship was superb, and the acrobatic feats
unexcelled.
Legislative Proceedings.
We have condensed the proceedings of the
Legislature fcr last week, as furnished by the
Columbia Phoenix. In order to keep our read?
ers advised, we shall continue during the ses?
sion to make a summary of the most important
measures presented and acted upon. So far
there is promise of improvement upon the last
General Assembly, although occasionally evi?
dence is not lacking that the Radical majority
intend to use their power for party ends and
purposes. When this motive is laid aside, and
the members address themselves earnestly to
work for the advancement and prosperity of
the whole State, with a view of securing a faith?
ful, economical, and honest administration of
public affairs, it will afford us pleasure to com?
mend their conduct, without regard to party
linesv
2Tot Anxious.
One of our subscribers in an adjoining coun?
ty (who belongs the delinquent class,) upon ob?
serving last week that he could ascertain the
meaning of the Red X Mark on application to
this office, writes to us that he is not anxions
~on the subject, as he has no desire to get hold
ef any of our secrets! This is not the exact
language, as he is a little profane, and applied
a hard word to fu'ly emphasize his expression.
Well, whether or not he has any anxiety on
the subject, there are so many others evidently
of the same opinion, that we will volunteer the
information for the benefit of all like him. It
means that there are a great many persons in?
debted to this office for subscription, and un?
less they give heed to our repeated gentle
warnings, we shall try what virtue there is in
stronger remedies, such as the law affords! Be
ye warned, delinquent friend, or your want of
ciriosity in these matters might lead you into
trouble.

Anderson Fanners' Association.
It should not be" forgotten by any of our cit?
izens that the Anderson Farmers' Association
will meet at this place on Saturday, 17th of
December, in accordance with a resolution
adopted at the annual meeting held during the
late Fair. The object of the approaching meet?
ing is to devise ways and means for placing the
Association upon a more enduring basis. The
society has been organized for several years, and
under its auspices three successful Fairs have
been held, each bringing interest and gaining
importance over its predecessor. These Fairs
have been mainly conducted by a few citizens,
who bore an active part,, with the laudable pur?
poses of establishing the Association perma?
nently and inducing, other people to become
interested in its success. Their voluntary la?
bors have been rewarded, it is true, with abun?
dant encouragement, and so far the society has
been self-sustaining. It has incurred no debt,
and is free from every embarrassment. Beyond
this healthy condition of its finances, however,
the Association cannot boast of the present
state of affairs. Only a small number of citi?
zens have become Life Members, and this year
there is a great falling off in the Annual Mem?
bership. It is under these circumstances that
the Farmers' Association is called upon to meet
and decide upon its future. Will not every
intelligent farmer become interested in this
matter? There is no division in respect to the
advantages and importance of an agricultural
society in our midst, and it only needs the de?
votion of a little time,, labor and money to ac?
complish the permanent establishment ef this
Association. Fair grounds should be pur-1
chased, and buildings erected thereon, and the
principle objects of the Association should be j
kept constantly in view. We have no particu?
lar scheme to advance for the consideration of
the Association, and we are linked to no special
means for the attainment of the ends above set
forth. But we have felt it a duty, as a^ournal
ist and as Secretary of the Association, to place
ithe facts before the public, and urge upon the
Farmers the necessity and importance of a gen?
eral attendance at the proposed meeting, in
order that the wisest measures may be adopted
find the most comprehensive plans agreed upon j
for the promotion and stimulation of the agri- j
cultural, horticultural and stock-growing in?
terests of the county, '

Foi items see the Clerk's report under tho diffurent heads.
We congratulate the tax-payers that, whilst we have le?
vied but ?>}/, mill* ou the dollar of the tnxable property, we
have a balance of $14% 99 iu the Treasury, after paying
all proper claims.
There remains uncollected on the_books of tho Treasu?
rer, $5278 07.
This is the only County that has levied less than the
amount allowed by the Legislature, (3 1-10 mills,) and, as
wc nave reason to believe, the only oue out of debt, some
having levied as high as 7 1-10 mills.
Respectfully submit toil,
