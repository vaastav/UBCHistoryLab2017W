r THS PRESlOENrS MESSAGE.
President Arthur sent his mes
sage to Congress on ; Monday. The
following is a brief synopsis of the
more : important points touched
upon:
Tlie President preface bis message with
review of the more important matters
which appertain to our foreign and diplo
matic Intercourse. The South American
troubles are treated at length, and comprise
a succinct review of what has been done by
the government In the direction of an ami
cable adjustment of the pending difficulties
between the belligerents. The mission of
Mr. Tresoott and Walker Blaine to Peru and
Chill la recalled, and reference la made to
the reports submitted by them, which were
the subject of full discussion In congress
and otherwise officially, last spring.
The president notifies eongreas that, pur
suant to the confirmation by the senate of
the special commissioners nominated by
him arrangements have been progressing
for a commercial treaty with Mexico, and
the departure of the commission will not be
long delayed. Mention is made of several
copyright and international treaties, nota
bly with Hpain and Belgium.
The president treats briefly the matter of
the arrest and imprisonment of American
citizens in English jails, reciting the fact
of the arrests and of the Inquiry regarding
them on behalf of this government.
The president next reviews the operations
of the treasury department.
The excess of revenues over expenditures
was IltoMlo.tH, and the amount applied
to the reduction of the debt lsl.o6.
The imports during the year amounted to
724,.',674. The balance of trade in our fa
vor, in lace of our decreased exports aggre
gated nearly t2C,000,0U0.
The president congratulates the country
upon its prosperity .and favorsaiidgid econ
omy In public expenditures and a reduc
tion of the Internal taxes. He indorses the
recommendation of the secretary of the
treasury that the tax on distilled spirits,
tobacco and fermented liquors be reduced
to a minimum consistent with sufficient
revenue to meet largely in part the ordina
ry demands of the government. He favors
leaving spirits, tobacco and fermented liq
uors to bear the burden.
A considerable portion of the messaagels
devoted to a report of the operations con
nected with the refunding of the tbree-and-a-half-per-eent.
bonds into three-per-oen'e.
Touching the tariff, the president renews
his recommendation of last year, that the
existing laws need revision. He expresses
the hope that the labors and the report of
the tariff commission may be so enlighten
ed as to facilitate congress in dealing with
the subject. The president also renews his
recommendation for the early retirement
of the silver certificate, on the ground that
tney iorm an unnecessary aaaiuon to me
paper currency, which he thinks can be
supplied In sufficient amounts to meet the
demands of trade bv the national banks.
That portion of tuu message which relates
to the war department is of interest chiefly
Decause 01 ine concurrence oy me prewueut

increase of the army and the curtailment of
appropriations lor tne puDiic wonts.
The operations of the navy department
are very briefly reviewed.
The policy of the secretary of the interior,
with regard to Indian affairs, meets the
president's approval. He urges that such
treatment of the Indians as will tend to
civilise them, should be encouraged, and
calls attention to the firm, and yet human
isms influences which have Deen turown
aiiout them during tbe past year, resulting
In an exceptional season or freedom iroiu

timates, accounted for the adjudication or a
greater number of claims because of the in
creased clerical force authorised at the last
Mainn of nontrresa.
The president recalls ine prosecution 01

made, and the determination of the admin
istration to secure a full investigation and a

Clares it to be his purpose, as it is thatof the
department, to obtain only a Just result,
and one that will commend itself to intelli
gent and fair-minded opinion. But the ad
ministration wiU not suffer obstruction at
tha hands of its own offiuial. as has been
shown by removals from office as the pen
alty of official departures from a oorreot
course of action. The president takes care
to emphasize the infliction of these penal
ties as having been prompted wholly in a
spirit of loyalty to the reasonable demands
of the government, and he commends the
action or tne department 01 justice iu una
rekect, referring to the attorney-general's
report and correspondence transmitted from
the deoartment of lustice.
The memaee concludes with a review of
the operations of the commissioners of the
I It: I. W 1AM UU1 UIH. ,
THE MEW PENITENTIARY.
The Penitentiary Commission ap
pointed by the last Legislature to
take under advisement the question
of removing the penitentiary from
its present site in the city of Nash
ville, to some other point iu David
son county, which of course meant
the building of a new and more
commodious building, met at the
Maxwell House in that city, on last
Tuesday night, to examine plans
and specifications for the new build
ing, submitted by Mr. J. B. Cook,
architect, of Memphis. Mr. Cook
opened and explained his plans to
the Commission, which call for a
building with two thousand cells
and all the latest and most approved
appliances. It is said the building
as proposed will cost about f 1,500,
000. The members of the Commis
sion were much pleased with the
plans of Mr. Cook and it is thought,
will send in a report to the next
Legislature, recommending the re
moval of the penitentiary and the
building of a new one according to
Mr. Cook's designs. The demands
that something be done by the next
Legislature in this matter, are im
mediate and pressing and it is sin
cerely hoped by the people of the
State that prompt action will be
taken.
We have received copies of the
new Cincinnati Daily Democratic
paper, the News, of which Mr. H.
M. Doak is editor-in-chief, and Mr.
Emmett G. Logan Managing edit
or. The news is a good sized paper,
clearly printed and its every de
partment bearing evidence of a full
and able corps of editors and news
gatherers. There is said to be plen
ty of room in Cincinnati for a live,
active, enterprising Democratic pa
per and it is safe to predict tbat the
NewH will amply fill the bill. At
its editorial columns will be largely
filled by the writings of former
Tennesseans, it is reasonable to
suppose it will contain much about
Tennessee affairs, and no doubt will
have many readers in .this State.
Siher Wedding of Mr. and Mrs. J.B. Ktllebrew
Mr. and Mrs. J. B. Killebrewi
than whom Montgomery county
has no more highly esteemed and
worthy citizens, celebrated their
silver wedding at their country res
idence on Monday night last. Of
the happy event the Nashville Ban
ner says :
Col. and Mrs. J. B. Killebrew
celebrated the twenty-fifth anni
versary of their marriage at their
delightful country residence, "Bos
cobel." near Clarksville, last night.
Only the intimate friends and rela
tives of the family were present.
It was an interesting occasion. A
large number of handsome presents
were displayed in the parlors.
On the night of their marriage,
just twenty-flve years ago, Col. Kil
lebrew placed a ring on the finger
of his wife "with a wish." The
wish has never been told, and the
ring has never been removed from
Mrs. Killebrew's finger. Last night
he presented his wife with another
ring, as evidence of the renewal of
the vows made a quarter of a cent
ury ago.
The presents consisted of a silver
tea service, a dozen forks, a pair of
elegant butter bowls, a silver bowl,
pitcher, soap dish, tea set, fruit
bowls, castor and many other beau
tiful and valuable gifts.
The occasion was one of great en
joyment to those present. The
young people engaged In dancing,
while the older ones passed the eve
ning in reviving the past, which is
always more or leas pleasant and
fascinating to all of us.
The friends of Col. and Mrs. Kil
lebrew join heartily in wishing
them happiness and prosperity
throughout the remainder of their
Uvea.
SCIENTIFIC MISSCEUANf.
Late investigations of German
scientists have shown that the elec
tric light is not only healthier than
other methods of illumination in
leaving the air purer, but that it in
creases the power of vision in somo
respects, especially in distinguish
ing colors. Red, blue, green and
yellow are much more distinct un
der this light than by daylight.
Two Leipsic chemists have de
vised & process for obtaining sugar
iu a permanently liquid form. This
result is said to be effected by add
ing to a purified sugar solution a
small quantity of citric acid, which
cm bines with the sugar and de
prives it of its tendency to crystal
lize.
Some experiments by M. Gaun
tier appear to prove that human
saliva possesses in a milder degree
the same poisonous property as that
of serpents. The human saliva in
jected under the skin of a bird
caused death, with symptoms very
closely resembling those resulting
from serpent bites.
A new theory of the so-called fas
cination of birds by snakes is that
the bird mistakes the snake's
tongue, which the reptile keeps in
rapid and constant motion, for a
lively worm, and watches it intent
1? with the anticipation of devour
ing it.
M. Pasteur has resolved to ex
tend his studies in vaccination to
yellow fever, with a view of deter
mining whether or not the disease
is due to parasites and can be guard
ed against by inoculation. . A
broad field of investigation is open
to Pasteur, as it is suggested by his
discoveries thus far that all conta
gious maladies may be due to para
sitic growths.the virulence of which
may be so reduced by his method
of inoculation as to render this class
of diseases no longer a matter of
dread.
A Neopolitan gardener, after
years of experiment, has produced
a camclia with a delicate perfume,
and he thinks it probable that these
flowers may In the near future be
so cultivated as to rival the rose in
the fragrance of its odor.
Mr. C. Shaler Smith has given
the results of extensive observations
in relation to the pressure exerted
by the wind. The most violent
gale recorded by him was at East
St. Louis in 1371, when the wind
overturned a locomotive, the force
developed in so doing being no less
than 93 pounds per square foot. At
St. Charles a jail was destroyed in
1877, the pressure required being 84
pounds per square foot. At Marsh
field In 1880 a brick mansion was
leveled, the force necessary being 58
pounds per square foot. Below
these extraordinary pressures, Mr,
Smith instances numerous cases of
trains blown off rails, and bridges,
etc., blown down by gales of 24 to
81 pounds per square foot. In all
the examples tne lowest rorce re
quired to do the observed damage
has been taken as the maximum
power of the wind, although, of
course, it may have been higher.
Enthusiasts who make a special
study of sun-spots and attendant
phenomena believe that the corner
stone of a new science is being laid
by discoveries pointing to an inti
mate connection between solar and
terrestrial meteorology. Just what
the connection is they are not able
to clearly define, although electric,
ity is suspected of being the agent
through which the effects are mani
fested upon our planet. It is known
that the gaseous envelope of the sun
is affected by eruptions of such pro
digious magnitude as to be utterly
beyond our power of conception,
these disturbances appearing to us
in the form of rapidly changing
spots and protuberances. The eras
of the spots, or sun-storms, occur at
remarkably regular intervals, a
complete cycle of the various stages
of activity from maximum to mini
mum and again to maximum being
performed in about eleven years
the so-called ''sun-spot period."
The sun-spot physicists claim a co
incidence spf the periods of maxi
mum spots and years of great at
mospheric and physical disturbance
in the earth. The present has been
a year of great solar disturbances,
while It has been marked by vio
lent storms and earthquakes upon
our globe. Further than this, these
scientists claim to have recently de
tected by simultaneous observation
minor atmospheric changes as the
result of corresponding movements
in the sun. Many difficulties at
tend these observations, but the
Astronomer Royal for Scotland and
others believe that the state of the
sun will some day become an im
portant factor in our weather fore
casts and calculations.
On Monday night last, Deputy
Sheriff Joe Gerhart boarded the
South bound train at this point,
and .succeeded in arresting two men
named Wm. Edwards and Chas.
Ingram, upon a warrant sworn out
before a magistrate for an assault
with intent to kill, a Mr. White,
living in Dist. No. 4, this county.
Edwards and Ingram were making
for Texas, at the time of their cap
ture, in company with three other
men from the same neighborhood,
who purchased tickets for them
selves and the two named, at this
point. Deputy Gerhart was at the
depot in this city, on the night
named execting the men to take
the train here, this they failed to
do, but upon finding out that the
others had purchased two more
tickets than needed, he rightfully
surmised that Edwards and In
gram would board the train at some
point below here. He accordingly
took the train himself and was re
warded by seeing his men come
aboard tho train at Palmyra, when
he made the arrest and brought the
men back to town on the 11 o'clock
freight and lodged them in jail to
await the action of the grand jury.
There are said to be other parties
connected with the assault and the
affair has created a good deal of ex
citement in No. 4. This capture
was a neat piece of work on the
part of Deputy Gerhart and goes
far to enhance his reputation as a
wide awake and efficient officer.

WABIIIUTO!r LETTER.
The First Day mt the Sesslca. A
View from ma Reporter's Cat
tery. Tab lain x VlTSSt.
(From our regular Correspondent.)
Here we are again, looking down
from the unclouded heights of the
Reporter's Gallery, upon the Con
gress of the United States. Below
are the chosen representatives of
fifty millions of the most progress
ive people in the world. The House
has not been called to order, and for
this reason perhaps, is in great dis
order. Maine is shaking hands
with Texas: Western heartiness and
Southern warmth are actually pat
ting each other .on the back, from
Oregon to Florida ; while Massa
chusetts and South Carolina have
half lost their individuality in this
common Hall of States. We see no
political sections or bi sections yet ;
no shades of blue and gray. All are
moving, writhing, talking, laugh
ing, and greeting each other with
the abandon of boys returned to the
campus of their Alma Mater after a
long separation. And what an
eventful separation it has been!
But see, the hand on the dial plate
points to eleven. The sharp rat-ta
tat of the gavel is heard. To your
seats, Legislators ! Divide your
selves antagonistically, irreconcila
bly, politically, North, South, East,
West, tariff and anti-tariff, Repub
lican and Democrat, while the pale
chaplain intones a blessing on your
common country, the United States,
amen ! ;
.now, gentlemen, perform your
promises made on the hustings and
proclaimed in the platforms, to say
nothing of your unpublished prom
ises of place and preferment, that
you should never have made, to in
fluential constituents, and above all,
be vituous, and the country will be
happy.
It is too early to foretell the course
of legislation. Influential members
and Senators do not hesitate to ex
press their views, but the views of
legislators do not always result in
accomplished legislation. There is
a wide consensus of opinion among
the Republicans that there should
be an almost total abolition of in
ternal revenue duties, but it is be
lieved that a majority of Congress
will oppose any change in the whis
ky, beer and tobacco taxes, which
make the bulk of the internal reve
nue assessment. A large element
of the Republican side of the house
and Senate, whether tariff men or
free traders are opposed to any re
duction whatever on whisky and
tobacco, though they may consent
to a slight reduction on the latter
It is believed that no comprehen
sive review ol the tann schedules
will be made, but it is possible that
the tariff may be removed from a
dozen or two articles on which there
js universal agreement.
There will doubtless be much
discussion of the civil service re
form question, and it is probable
that a bill fixing the tenure of office
during good behavior for a stated
term of years will be passed.
The second trial of the Star-route
cases is set for to-day in the Crimi
nal court. By reason of the recent
developments, public interest in
these cases has been much intensi
fied. The selection of the new jury
will be watched with the most vig
ilant scrutiny, both by the govern
ment counsel and the counsel for
the defense. Public sentiment is
strong that a convn-tion is sure to
follow this second trial, and the
counsel for the government express
the utmost confidence that such
will be the result. The govern
ment counsel aver that they have
additional and exceedingly impor
tant testimony of a most convinc
ing character to offer. The defend
ants are very frequently seen in
public places, but they look much
subdued and have little to say.
Washington, Dec. 4, 1881
We learn of a serious accident
which befell a young man named
Met Giles, living near Garrettsburg
in the southern part of Christian
county, Ky., on Monday last, by
which he suffered the loss of a leg.
He was driving a four mule team
and was about starting to Hopkins
ville, when his lead mule became
unmanageable, running around and
in some way tripping the mule he
was riding, throwing it to the
ground, entangling young Giles in
the gear and badly fracturing one
of his ankles. The fracture was of
such a nature that his leg had to be
amputated, which was accordingly
done by Dr. Clardy of the neighbor
hood.
Police Regulations.
The Board of Mayor and Alder
men met in regular monthly session
on weciuesuay evening last (tne
time of meeting having been chang
ed from the first Monday in each
month to the first Wednesday night
in each month) at Citylail. The
regular monthly reports of the vari
ous city officers were read and ap
proved, bills audited, and much
other routine business transacted
The only business of especial public
interest was the regulation of the
hours of duty for the night and day
police. It peems that under an old
custom, ratherthan any stated law
on the subject, the day officers were
in the habit of coming on duty
at sun-up in the morning and re
maining until sun-down in the af
ternoon, and the night officers not
until 9 o'clock at night. This cus
tom, as it will be seen, leaves the
city without any police protection
from sun-down until 9 o'clock at
night, probably the most important
hours of the twenty-four when the
city should have police surveillance.
This matter was brought to the at
tention of the Board, and on
Wednesday night they passed a res
olution instructing the Citv Mar
shall and Captain of Police to see
that this intermission in the hours
of duty were filled by the force In
such a manner as they thought best.
This order was passed preliminary
to an ordinance upon the subject to
be reported at the next meeting by
the police committee. Some of the
police will now be on duty at all
hours.
It seems as if the tax on tobacco '

der. Its illustrations comprise ex
quisite engravings from the works
of eminent artists, with portraits,
local sketches and amusing comic
pictures. Its communications with
the Capitols of Europe is such as
to enable it to make immediate an
nouncement of all the changes and
modifications in styles that take
place in the centres of fashion, thus
enabling its readers to dress in the
most becoming attire at the small
est expense. This feature alone is
worth to a family many times tne

A hard-up editor in the far
away west speaks to his deliquent
subscribers in a way that is both
quaint and unmistakable. He says :

bones ana skull, with crest or me-
talic-burial casket, drawn in blood,
on the wrapper of your paper, you

has expired and that something has
got to be done, and there's no time
to monkey about it. Winter is up
