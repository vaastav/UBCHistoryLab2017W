I doubt If be suggested any reme

railroad rat en are too high and

hitely true, but the Preeldent did
not tall ue how we could bring
them down.
SENATOR NEW <*.). Indiana
It was a very strong message,

SENATOR UNDERWOOD ID.),
Alabama (minority fleer leader)
There are some things about It
which I approve and others which
T disapprove. Of course, at this
sessfcm there will be no chance to
consider many of the thing* sug
gested. We may get to rural

SENATOR MrNARY <R.). Ore

with what the President had to

SENATOR SIMMONS (D.l.

SENATOR CALDER (R.). New

worthy of moat serious thoiyht.

REPRESENTATIVE BOX (D.l,

Impractical in that It would lead

away with strikes. AMEN!
He couldn't do it by appointing
a special board to fcc8Twhei[
workmen might and might not
strike, unless he could persuade
workmen that it would be an im

the board would, in the long run,

of tha war. The President wan firm
upon this point, saying:
We are cognisant of the world's
struggles for full readjustment
and rehabilitation. and we have
shirked no duty which comes of
sympathy, or fraternity, or high
est fellowship amonf the nations.
Every obligation consonant with
American ideals and sanctioned
under our form of government la
willingly met When we cannot
support we do not demand. Our
constitutional limitations do not
forbid the exercise of a moral in

not "Tees than the high purpose we
have sought to serve.
Further along, the President said:

Those who assume that we
played our part In the world war
and later took ourselves aloof
and apart, unmindful of world
obligations, give 'scant credit to
the helpful part we assume in
International relationship*.
This was construed as the "re
tort courteous- to Clemenceau and
his criticisms, which have been so
liberally sprinkled throughout the
United States.
The four-power pact, the President
?aid, has abolished every probabil
ity of war on the Pacific, and
brought "new confidence for a
maintained peace." Ha declared the
treaty might be made a model tor
like assurances, wherever common
Interests are concerned.
Comment by Senators and Repre

however, by Administration lead
ers that the program given to Con

LRGBS RAIL LAWS.
The President devoted a consid
erable part of his mtsssgs to dis
cussion of the transportation prob
lem. He pointed out that railway
construction has not kspt pace with
the growth of population and that
present transportation facilities are
totally Inadequate for the business
of the country. He recommended
mergers and pooling of equipment,
co-ordination of rail transportation
with water carriers, arid the devel
opment of motor truck transporta
tion as h railway feeder instead of
a destructive competitor.
On the subject of strikes and
lockouts which tie up the transpor
tation and fuel industries, the Pres

favor of measurea which -would In
sure the continuance of operation
whenever labor difficulties occur.
He asaerted that while the railway
employes are entitled to adequate
compensation In return for the has
ard they assume, on the other hand,
the protection given thsm by the
Government should deny them the
right of withdrawal from service
without due warning or under dr
cumatancea that weuld bring about

Impotent and that measures must
be enacted to prevent the recur

adirlttlng that no government baa
the right to deny to labor the right
to quit, the President aaserted that
government has the right to insist
that such stopping* of work shall
not be timed aa to work hardahip
upon Its people nor disruption of
the orderly processes of life.
