THE REPORT OK THE SECRETARY OF WAR
shows that the army has been well and
: 1I i: J .1 . ..
vuuuuiuu niiy supplied, inai our small
. force has been actively employed, and
lias faithfully performed all the service
required of it. The morale of the army
ha9 Improved, and the number of deser
tions has materially decreased during the
year.
The Secretary recommends
1. That a pension be granted to the
widow of the late Lieutenant Henrv If.
Bptmer, Eighteenth Infantry, who lost his
lifo by yellow fever while in command of
the steamer J. M. Chambers, sent with
supplies for the relief of sufferers in the
South from that disease.
2. The establishment of the annuitv
scheme tor the benefit of the heirs of
deceased officers, as suggested by the
Paymaster General.
3. The adoption. by Congress ol a plan
for the publication "of the records of the
war of the rebellion, now being prepared
lor that purpose.
4. The increase of the extra per diem
of the soldier teachers employed in post
schools, and liberal appropriations for the
erection ol buildings for schools and li
braries at the different posts.
5. The repeal or amendment of the act
tf June 18, 1878, forbidding the "use of
the army as a posse comilatus, or other
wise, lor the purpose of executing the
laws, except in such cases and under such
circumstances as may be expresly au
thorized by the Constitution or by act of
Congress.
6. The passage of a joint resolution of
Congress legalizing the issues of rations,
tents and medicines which were made tor
the relief of sufferers Irom yellow fever.
7. That provision be made" for the erec
tion of a fire-proof building for the pre
servation of certain valuable records, now
constantly exposed to destruction by fire.
These recommendations are all coin
mended to your lavornble consideration.
THE NAVV.
The report ol the Secretary of the Navy
shows that the navy ha9 improved during
the last fiscal year. Work has been done
on seventy -live vessels, ten ol which have
been thoroughly repaired and made ready
lor sea. Two others are in rapid progress
towards completion. The total expendi
tures of the year, including the amount
appropriated for the deficiencies ol the
previous year, were $17,468,392 65. The
actual expenses chargeable to the year,
exclusive of these deficiencies, were $13,
306.914 09. or $767,199 18 less than those
of the previous year, and $4,948,677 74
less than the expenses, including the de
ficiencies. The estimates tor the fiscal
year ending June 30, 1880, are $14,562.
S81 45 exceeding the appropriations of
the present year only $33,949 75 ; which
excess i3 occasioned by the demands of
the Naval Academy and the Marine Corps
lis explained in the Secretary's report.
The appropriations fjr the present fiscal
year are $14,528,431 70. which, iu. the
opinion of the Secretarywill be ample
for all the current expenses of the de
partment during the year. The amount
drawn from the Treasury Irom July 1 to
November 1. 1878, is $4,740,544 i4 ol
which $70,980 75 ha9 beeu refunded,
leaving as the expend ture lor that period
$4,669 503 39. or . $520,899 24 Lisa than
the corresponding period of the last fiscal
year.
THE VOST-OFFICE DEPARTMENT.
The report of the Postmaster-General
embraces a detailed statement of the
operations of the Posc-office Department.
The expenditure ol that department for
the fiscal year ended June 30, 1878, were
$34,165,084 49 The receipts, including
sales of stamps, mone -order business
and official stamps, were $29,277,516 95.
'I he sum of $290,436 90, included in the
foregoing statement of expenditures, is
chargeable to preceding years, so that the
actual expenditures lor the fiscal year
ended June 30, 1878. are $33,874.647 60.
The amount drawp from the Treasury on
appropriations, in addition to the revenues
ot the Department, was $5,307,652 82.
The expenditures lor the fiscal year end-
i.fc uuuo ou, looo, aro estimated at $36,
671,900 and the receipts Irom all sources
at $30,664,023 90. leaving a deficiency to
be appropriated out of the'Treasury ot $5,
907,876 10. The report calla attention to
the fact that the compensation of Post
masters and of railroads tor carryino- the
mail is regulated by law, and that" the
failure ot Congress to appropriate the
amounts required tor these purposes does
not relieve the Government of responsi
bility, but necessarily increases the de
ficiency bills which Congress will be
called upon to pass.
In providing lor the postal service, the
following questions are presented : Should
Congress annually appropriate a sum lor
its expepsi s largely in excess ot its rev
enues, or should such rates of postage bo
established as will make the department
self-sustaining P Should the postal service
be reduced by excluding from the mails
matter which does not pay its way P
Should the number of post-routes be
diminished P Should other methods be
adopted which will increase the revenues
or diminish the expenses of the postal
service?
THE INTERNATIONAL POSTAL CONGRESS,
which met at Patis May 1, 1878, and con
tinued in session until June 4 ot the same
year, was composed of delegates from
nearly all the civilized countries of the
world. It adopted a new convention, to
take the place of the treaty concluded at
Berne, October 9, 1874, which goes into
effect on the 1st of ApriJ, 1879, between
the countries whose delegates have signed
it. It was ratified and approved, byand
with the consent of the President, Au
gust 13. 1878. A tvnnnaia nl ihlaITr,S
versal Postal Convention will be lound in
, the report of the Postmaster-General, and
the full text in the appendix thereto-.' In

tween all civilized nations.
Some embarrassment lias arisen out of
the conflict between the customs laws ot
this country and the provisions ot the
fostal Convention, in regard to the trans
missions ot foreign books and newspapers
to tins country by maw.
It is hoped that Congress will be able
to devise some means of reconciling the
uiuiuuuies which nave inus oeen creaieu,
so as to do justice to all parties involved.
THE SUPREME COURT.
The business ot the Supreme Court, and
of the courts in many of the circuits, has
increased to such an extent during the
past years that additional legislation is
imperative to relieve and prevent the
delay ol justice, and possible oppression
to suitors, which is thus occasioned. The
encumbered condition of these dockets is
presented anew in the report ot the Attorney-General,
and the remedy suggested
is earnestly urged for Congressional ac
tion. The creation ot additional circuit
judges, as proposed, would afford a com
plete remedy, and would involve an ex
pense at the present rate of salaries ot
not more than $60,000 a year.
DIDIAN AFFAIR8.
The annual reports of the Secretary of
the interior and ot the Commissioner of
Indian Affairs present an elaborate ac
count of the present condition of the In
dian tribes, and of that branch of tho pub
lic service which ministers to their in
terests. While the conduct ot the In
dians, generally, has been orderly, and
their relations with their neighbors friend
ly and peaceful, two local disturbances
have occurred, which were deplorable In
their character, but remained. haoDilv.
confined to a comparatively small num-
oer ot Indians. Ihe discontent anions'
the Bannocks, which led first to some
acts ot violence on the part of some mem
bers ot the tribe and finally to the outbreak
appears to have been caused by an
insufficiency ot food ou the reservation,
and this insufficiency to have been owing to
the inadequacy of the appropriations made
by Congress to the wants of the Indians.
at a time when the Indians were pre
vented irom supplying the deficiency by
hunting. Atter an arduous pursuit bv the
troops of the United Stales, and several en
gagements, the hostile Indians were re
duced to subjection, and the larger part
of them surrendered themselves as prison
ers. t In this connection. I desire to call
attention to the recommendation made by
the Secretary of the Interior, that a
sufficient fund be placed at the disposal ot
me r,xecuuve, io oe usea, with proper
accountability, at discretion, in sudden
emergencies ot the Indian service.
THE NORTHERN ClIEYENNES.
The Other rasa ot Hiatnrhanna vuaa ih.it
of a band of Northern Cheyennes, who
suddenly left their reservation in the In
dian Territory and marched rapidly
through the Slates ol Kansas and Nebraska
in the direction ol their old hunting
grounds, committing murders and other
crimes on their way. From documents
accompanying the report of the Secretary
of the Interior, it appears this diamrlnriv
band was as fully supplied with the neces
saries ot hie as the lour thous nd seven
hundred other Indians who rHninim.il
quietly on the reservation, and that the
disturbance was caused by men ol a rest-
ess ana miscnievous disposition among
the Indians themselves. Almnct tku nhnU
of this band have surrendered to the mili
tary authorities, and it is a gratilying tact
that, when some of them had taken reiuge
in the camp ol the lied Cloud Sioux, with
whom they had been in Irieudly relations,
the Sioux beid them as . prisoners and
rapidly gave them up the officers of the
United States, thus giving new proof of
the loyal spirit which, alarming rumors toJ
the contrary notwithstanding, they have
untormly shown ever since the wishes
they expressed at the council vt Septem
ber, 1877, had been complied with.
'., '.' A RECOMMENDATION.
Both the Secretary of the Interior and
the Secretary ot War uuite in the recom
mendation that provision be made by Con
gress for the organization of a corps of
mounted "Indian auxiliaries," to be un
der the control of the army, and to be
used tor the purpose of keeping the In
dians on their reservations and prevent
ing or repressing disturbance on their
part. I earnestly concur in this recom
mendation. It is believed that the or
ganization ot such a bodv of I nil tan nmr.
airy, receiving a moderate pay from the
government, would considerably weaken
the restless element among the Indians by
withdrawing from it a number ot young
men and giving them congenial employ
ment under the Government, it bein a
matter of experience that Indians iu ourser
vice almost without exception are faithful
in the performance of the duties assigned
to them. Such an organization would
materially aid the army in theuccomplbh
ment ot a task tor which its numerical
strength is sometimes found insufficient.
COUNSELING KINDNESS. - '
Rut. while the employment of lorc for
the prevention or repression of Indian
troubles is of occasional necessity, and
wise preparation should be made to that
end. greater reliance must be placed on
humane and civilizing agencies tor the
ultimate solution ot what is called the In
dian problem. It may be very difficult,
and require much patient effort, to curb
the unruly spirits of the savage Indians
i io restraints ot civilized lite, but etoeri-
ence shows that it is not impossible. Many
of the tribes which are now quiet and or
derly and sell-supporting were once as
savage as auy that at present roam over
the plains or la the mountains of the far
West, and were then considered Inacces
sible to civilizing influences. It may be
impossible to raise them fully up to the
level of the white population ol the United
States; but we should not forget that they
are the aborigines ot the country, anil
called the soil their own on which our
people have grown rich powerful and
happy. VVe owe it to them as a moral
duty to help them in attaining at leust
that degree of civilization which they may
be able to reach. It is not only our duty
it is also our interest to do so. Indians
who have become agriculturists or herds
men, and feel an interest in property,
will thenceforth cease to be a warlike and
disturbing element. It is also a well au
thenticated fact that Indians are apt to be
peaceable and quiet when their children
are at school, and lam gratified to know,
Irom the expression ol Indians themselves
and from many concurring reports, that
there is a steadily increasing desire, even
among Indians belonging to comparatively
wild tribes, to have their children educa
ted. I invite attention to the reports of
the Secretary of the Interior and the Com
missioner ol Indian Affairs, touching the
experiment receniiv inaugurated, in
taking fifty Indian children, boys and
girls, from different tribes, to the (lamp
ton Normal Agricultural Institute, in
Virginia where they are to. receive an
elementary English education and training
in agriculture and other useful work, to
be returned to their tribes, after the com
pleted course, as interpreters, instructors.
and examples. It is reported that the
officer charged with the selection of those
children might have had thousands of
young Indians sent with him had it been
possible to make provision lor them. 1
agree with the Secretary of the Interior
in saying that "the result i this interest
ing experiment, if lavor.ible. may be des
tined to become an important lactor in
the advancement ot civilization among the
Indians "
The question, whether a change in the
control ot the Indian service should be
made, was. at the last session of Congress,
referred to noommittee tor inquiry and re
port. Without desiring to anticipate that
report, I venture to express the hope that
in the decision ol so important a Question.
the views expressed above niav not.
be lost sight of, and that the decision,
whatever it may hp, will arrest lurther
agitation at this subject, such agitation
oeing apt, to produce a disturbing effect
upon the service as well as on the Indians
themselves.
THE HOT SPRINGS COMMISSION.
In the enrolment of the bill making ap
propriations lor sundry civiljexpenses, at
the last session ot Congress that portion
wmcn proviuen lortne continuation ol the
Hot Springs Commission was omitted.
As the Commitioner had completed the
work of taking testimony on the many
conflicting claims, the suspension of their
labors, before determining the rights of
claimants, threatened, lor a time, to em
barrass the interests, not only of the Gov
ernment, but also a large number ol' the
citizens of Hot Springs, who were waiting
tor hnal action on their claims betore
beginning contemplated improveruents.
In order to prevent serious difficulties,
which were apprehended, and at the soli
citation ol many leading citizens of Hot
springs, and others interested in the wel
fare of the town, the Secretary of the In
terior was authorized to request the late
commissioners to take charge of the rec
ords of their proceedingc, and to perform
such work as could properly be done by
them under such circumstances, to facili
tate the future adjudication of the claims
at an early day, and to preserve the status
of the claimants until their rights should
be finally determined. The late comrhis
sioneis complied with that request, and
report that (he testimony, in all the cases,
has been written out, examined, briefed,
and so arranged as to facilitate an early
settlement when authorized by law. It
is recommended that the .requisite au
thority be given at as early a day in the
session as possible, and that a fair com
pensation be allowed the late commission
ers for the expense incurred and the la
bor performed by them since the 25th ot
June last.
TIMBER LANDS. '
I invite the attention of Congress to the
recommendations made by Secretary of
the Interior with regard to the preserva
tion ot the timber on the public lands of
the United Stales. The protiction of the
public property is one of the first duties of
the Government. The Department of the
Interior should , therefore be enabled by
sufficient appropriations to enforce the
laws in that respect. But this matter
appears still more important as a question
ot publio economy. The rapid destruction
ol our forests is an uvil fraught with the
gravest consequences, especially in the
mountainous districts, where the rocky
slopes, once denued ot their trees, will re
main so forever. There the injury, once
done, can not be repaired. I fully concur
with the Secretary of the Interior in the
opinion that, for this reason, a legislation
touching the publio timber in the moun.
tainous States and Territories of the West,
should be especially well considered, and
that existing laws, in which the destruc
tion of the forests is not sufficiently guard
ed against, should be speedily modified.
A general law concerning this important
subject appears to me to be a matter of
urgent publio necessity. :
From the organization ot the Govern
ment, the Importance ot encouraging, by
an possioia means, me increase ot our
agricultural productions has been acknow
ledged and urged upon the attention of
Congress and the people as the surest and
readiest means of increasing our substan
tial and enduring prosperity. i i
THE WORDS OF WASHINGTON '; "',
are so applicable to-day as when, in his
eighth annual message, he said : 'It is
not to be doutbed that with reference eith
er to individual or natural welfare, agri
culture is ot primary importance. In
proportion as nations, advance n popula
tion and other circumstances ot maturity,
the truth becomes moro apparent, and
renders the cultivation of the) soul more
and more an object ot publio patronage.
Institutions for promoting it grow up,
supported by the publio purse and to
that object 'can it be dedicated with
greater propriety P Among the means
which haye been employed to this end,
none have been attended with greater
success than the establishment ot boards
composed of proper characters, charged
with collecting and diffusing iolormation
and enabled, by premiums and small
pecuniary aids, to- encourage and assist

skill and observation, and spreading them
uience over the whole nation. Expert
ence accordingly hath shown that they
are very cheap instruments of immense
national benefit."
AGRICULTURE.
The great preponderance of theagricul
lural over any other interest in the United
States entitles It to all the consideration
claimed for it by Washington. About onp.
half of tho population of the United States
Is engaged In agriculture. The value of
the agaisultunl products of the United
mates i:r tni year Is estimated at
$3,000,000,000. The exports ot agricul
tural products tor the year 1877, as ap
pears irom the report ot the Bureau of
statistics, were $j24.000.000. The great
extent ol our country, with its diversity
ol soil and climate, enables us to produce
wiinin our own ooracrs, and by our own
la'tior, not only the necessaries but most
luxuries that are consumed in civilized
countries. Yet, notwithstanding our ad
vantages of soil, climate, and intercom
munication, it appears from the statistical
statements in the report ol the Commis
sioner ol Agriculture, that we import an
nually trora foreign lands many millions
ot dollars' worth ot agricultural products
which could be raised in our own coun
try.
Numerous questions arise in the prac
tice ol advanced agriculture which can
only be answered bv experiments. ohn
costly and sometimes fruitless, which are
beyond the means ol private individuals,
and are just and proper charged on the
whole nation for the "benefit ot the nation.
It Is good policy, especially in times of
depression and uncertainty in other busi
ness pursuit, with a vast area ot unculti
vated and hence unproductive territory
wisely opened to
HOMESTEAD SETTLEMENT,
to encourage, by everv proper and le-
gitimate means, the occupation and til
lage ot the soil. The efforts ot the De
partment ol Agriculture to stimulate o d
and introduce new agricultral industries,
to improve the qualify and increase the
quantity of our products, to determine the
value ot old or establish the importance.
of new methods of culture, are wortli7 of
your careful and favorable consideration.
and assistance by such appropriations of
money and enlargement of facilities as
may seem to be demanded by the present
favorable conditions lor the growth and
rapid development ot this important in
terest. 1 .
The abuse of animals in transit is wide
ly attracting public attention. A national
convention of societies specially interested
in tne suoiecc nas recently met at Balti
more, and the facts developed, both in
regard to cruelty to animals and the
effort ol such cruelties upon the public
health, would seem to demand the care
ful consideration ol Congress, and Ihe
enactment ot moro efficient laws for the
prevention ol these abuses.
The report ot the Commissioner ot the
Bureau ot Education shows very grati
tying progress throughout the country,
in all the interests committed to the care
of this important office. The report is
especially encouraging with respect to
the extension ot the advantages of
THE COMMON-SCHOOL SYSTEM,
in sections of the couctrv where the gen
eral enjoyment ot the privilege of free
schools is not yet attained.
To education more than to any other
agency we are to look, as the resource for
the advancement of the people, in the re
quisite knowledge and appreciation of
their rights and responsibilities as citizens,
and I desire to repeat the suggestion con
tained in my former message In behalf of
the enactment of appropriate measures by
Congress for the purpose ot supplement
ing with national aid the local systems ot
education in the several States.
Adequate accommodations for the
great library, which is overgrowing the
capacity ot the rooms now occupied at
the Capitol, should be provided without
further delay. Thiinvaluable collection
of books, manuscripts, and illustrative art,
has grown to such proportions, in con
nection with the copyright system of the
country, as to demand the prompt and
careful -attention of .Congress to save it
from injury in its present crowded and
insufficient quarters. As this library is
national in its character, and must, Irom
the nature of the case, increase even
more rapidly in the future than In the
past, it cannot be doubled that the peo
ple will sauction any wise expenditure to
preserve it and to enlarge its usefulness.
MISCELLLAMEOUS.
The appeal of the Regents of the Smith
sonian Institution for Ihe. means to organ
ize, exhibit and make available for the
public benefit the articles now stored
away belonging to the National Museum,
I hereby recommend to your' favorable
consideration.
Tho attention of Congress is again in
vested to the condition of the river-front
of the city ot Washington. 1 It is a matter
of vital importance to the residents ot the
National Capital, both temporary and
permanent, that the low lands in front ot
the city, now subject to tidal overflow,
should be reclaimed, In their present
condition, these flats obstruct the drainage
of the city, and are a dangerous source ot
malarial poison. The reclamation willA,
improve the navagation f the river, Ly
restricting and consequently deepening its
channel, and is also ot importance, when
considered in connection with the exten
sion ol the public ground and the enlarge
ment of Ihe park, west and' south ot the
Washington Monument. The report of

The report of the Commissioners of Dis-,
trict ol Columbia presents a detailed state
ment of the allairs ot the District.
The relative expenditures by the United
States and the District lor local purposes
are contrasttd. showing that the expendi
tures by tho people ot the District greatly
exceed 'those of the General Government.
The exhibit Is made in connection with
estimates for the requisite repair ol def'ec- tff
tive payments and sewers of the city, J
which is a work of immediate necessity,
and, In the same connection, a J lan is
presented tor the payment funding of the
outstanding securities of the District.,
The benevolent, reformatory, and pen
al institutions i the District are all en
titled to the lavorable attention ot Con
gress. Tho llelorm School needs addi
tion buildings and teiichers. Appro
priations which will place all ol these
institutiwns in a condition to become mo
dtls of usefulness and beneficence will be
regarded by the country as liberality wise
ly bestowed.
The Commissioners, with evident jus
tice request attention to the discrimination
made by Congress against the District in
the donation ol land lor the support of j
the public schools, and ask that the same A.
liberality that has been Shown tn th in- -
habitants ot the various States and Terri
tories ot the United States may be exten
ded to the District of Columbia.
The commissioners also invite atten
tion to the damage inflicted upon public
and private interests by the present loca
tion of the dep-its and switching tracks of
the several railroads entering the citv.
and ask tor legislation looking to their re
moval. The recommendations and sug
gestions contained in the report will, I
trust, receive the careful consideration of
Congress.
IN CONCLUSION.
Sufficient time has, perhaps, not elapsed
since the recognization of the Govern
ment ot the District, under the recent
legislation ot Congress, tor th
cf a confident, opinion as to its successtul
operation; but the practical results al
ready attained are so sat i.-factory that -the
Iriends of the new Government may well
urge upon Congress the wisdom "of its-
continuance, without essential modifi
cation, until, by actuai experience, its
advantages and delects may be more
iuiiv ascertained. R. B. Haves.
