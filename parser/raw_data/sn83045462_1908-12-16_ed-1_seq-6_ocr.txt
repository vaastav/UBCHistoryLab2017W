The Schoolhouse Findings.
T?#> report ol tti<? architects and nunciors
chosen by the Commissioners to inquire
inl" the physical condition of the local
public school system is impressive in its
thoroughness and its fairness. It is a
full, plain statement of facts as they exist,
unsensational and clearly free from
prejudice or a desire on the part of the
investigators either to whitewash anybody
or to put anybody "in a hole." It is
the more effective in its temperate tone
than if it had laid stress upon the defects
discovered and sought to alarm the
public.
It was the purpose of the Commissioners
In selecting these citizens to examine
the school buildings to ascertain conditions.
and in discharging that duty the
investigators were wise in not undertaking
to lay blame upon individuals or
groups for such defects as they found.
The report fully meets the official requirements
as a presentation of facts, and
it points the way clearly to the removal
of all the factors which niay have caused
anxiety on the part of the people. It is
a great relief to the public to find that
there is nothing seriously wrong with the
school equipment, to the point of menacing
the community with disaster, although
many defects were found, both in the
planning and the construction of the
buildings and in their management. It
is particularly satisfying to the community
that after the immediately essentia]
corrections have been made?supplementing
those that have been undertaken
in the course of the investigationthere
will be no cause whatever of panic
among the teachers and the pupils, and
no ground for apprehension on the part of
parents.
All the authorities now clearly understand
what is to be done to bring the
schools up to the highest possible mark
permitted by the appropriations. Some
of the worst defects have already been
cured. Others will doubtless be corrected
without delay. Meanwhile this report
should enable the Commissioners to go
ahead and get from Congress the funds
necessary for the repair work indicated
by the investigators and for the completion
and construction of the new buildings
required to relieve congestion and
to carry out the recommendations as to
the safety of the children.
The commission was charged with the
igsk of eliciting the exact facts and indicating
the real remedies for such defects
as it might find. It has discharged
this duty conscientiously sind capably,
without furnishing any one controversialist
with a monopoly of ammunition for attacks
upon others. Vet the report is not
a "whitewash." It does not condone defaults
or minimize defects in order that
any individual's sensibilities may be
spared from injury. The members of the
wjiiiuiBBtuii nave piainty acted solely in
the public interest, and now it is tho duty
f everybody, on the basis of this excellent
presentation, to turn in and work shoulder
to shoulder to the end that the children
may be given the fullest possible protection
from danger. There Should be no
wore wasting of time in futile recriminatory
discussion of responsibility for
things that have been done or left undone
in the past, but a whole-hearted co-operation
on all sides to make the public
schools of Washington just as sanitary
ar.d just as safe nfi Congress in its appropriations
will permit.
Another "Marathon*' Victor.
T.:?sc "Marathon" races are yielding
some very confusing results. First Hayes
beats Dorando in England on a:i outdoor
course, the Italian losing because he lacks
staving power and falling almost at the
tape. Next Dorando beats Hayes In New
Vork ?n an indoor race, both men finishing
in good condition and establishing a new
retoid for the distance. Finally, Longboat
who gave up in the twentieth
mile in the English race, runs Dorando
?T his feet in .Madison Square Garden.
winning easily w.th the Italian in
total collapse and never finishing. But
ti e Indian's race was *_'ns4 mmutes slower
man t.int of Dorando when he beat Hayes.
Up to the twentieth mile the runners, who
had kept within less than three yards of
re another from the crack of the pistol,
were ahead of the Dorando-Hayes New
Vork time. The pace, however, told on
both men. more severely on Dorando. as
the event proved. Possibly if the early
pace had been more moderate Dorando.
with Ins ability to sprint and nia more
nervous action, might have held the Indian
down to a position from which us
could have rushed to victory on the last
lap. Dorando now has collapsed twice on
the course, and must he rated as an uncertain
quantity in long-distance runs.

defeat to his credit. There should now be

and then *'1 three men should contest

Outdoor course, Marathon distance.
A strong argument In favor of granting
those London ladie.- the right to vote is
that it might prevent them front being

Fortunately for tiic courts, only a small
percentage of threatened libel suits materialize.
A Czar and His Subjects.
The N>w York Kvnlng Post observes:
"The ferocious republican insurgents in
Congress are really as considerate as
any (Jtlbertiau pirate who never let a
Sunday pass without writing to his
mother, or as that lion rough who in
wildest rage did roar, but was only Snug
the Joiner. Having determined upon the
overthrow of the House rules which make
Mr. Cannon a czar and force the congressman
who would get a hearing to
consult the Speaker in his private room,
our implacable Insurgents are going to see
the Speaker about It In his private room.
"Please, sir," congressmen have been in
the habit of saying up till now, "may I
get the floor some aay next week to
-peak on the rivers and harbors bill?"
"No." says Mr. Cannon. "Well, then,
please sir. may 1 get the floor to say
that you ere a czar, a despot, a usurper,
a brutal presiding officer, an Ignorant parliamentarian'."
Thla little flight of fancy, the Evening
Post may he interested to hear, is justified
by a fact.
In the Flfty-flrzt House, when Mr. Reid
first applied the new rules, there served
a man from North Carolina of the name
of MeC'tgmmy. He oas a thin and an explosive
person, a farmer, and much given
to the rural style of political discussion.
But he was sound at the core, and had
MAK. Being a democrat, be
united with his party associates in de
nounelng the new order of procedure, al
though he had but the dimmest idea o
the matter. But he admired Mr. Rei<
very much, and between the two theri
was a strong bond of good feelhV Mr
MoCIammy was one of the democrats o
that day who while holding Mr. Reid U]
in public to the severest censure, in the!
hearts were sighing for Just such a mat
for leader on their ow n side.
One day the North Carolina membe
went to the Speaker and asked to b<
recognized the next day for a speech.
"On what subject?" asked the Speaker
"You." replied Mr. McClammy.
"The rules, you mean?"
"Yes. It comes to the same thing
You see. there's a fellow running agalns
mc for the nomination, and I'm about tj
start for home to meet him on the stump
If I could send a red-hot speech ahoad o
me in the Record it would help."
"You'll give it to me in good st>1e, wil
you 7"
"T il give you the best I've got in thi
shop."
"Well, with that understanding yoi
shall have a chance tomorrow.
Mr. McClammy exhausted the curren
vocabulary of criticism, called the Speake'
a tjrant. a czar, and predicted that unlesi
a halt was called America would soon b<
no better than Russia.
Mr. Reed presided, and neither winke<
nor blinked. All efforts to call the Tar
heel statesman to order were ruled out
and the terrible arraignment closed witl
great applause on the democratic side.
In a few days Mr. McClammy followet
his- speech home, but found that his ef
fort had been in vain. His people had no
been enthused by it, and the other fellov
got the nomination.
i'pon his return to Washington. Mr
McClammy, making a virtue of necessity
called on the Speaker and confessed judg
inent. The speech had failed. But hi
would not forget the courtesy of the rec
ognition.
"I'm sorry. Mac." drawled the Speaker
shaking his friend's hand. "I wanted yoi
to win. But don't be cast down. Yoi
did as well with the subject as> anybod;
who has attempted it."
Be not deceived by this clatter abou
czars and ozarlsm. It is immensely am
amusingly Pickwickian from the Inside.
The Canal Message.
The President's invective disfigured?
to use a mild word?his Panama messago.
That sort of thing is easily
overdone." It goes with anger, real or
simulated, and anger should never
mark a state paper. Even a criminal
lawyer, working up a jury with furj
and superlatives, can injure his case b>
excesses of that kind. Facts speak
louder than words. They carry a sufficient
denunciation of false statements
where false statements have been
made. They really secure the verdict,
either from a jury of twelve men, or
from the whole people.
For the rest, the message is a strong
document. It sets forth from sources
entitled to the highest credit what
all should be gratified to hear, and
what few will be surprised to hear.
Not many persons in all probability hav?
ever believed that there was a riot ol
American corruption in the acquisition
of the canal property by this government.
Nothing of a confirmatory character
has ever been offered to support
the assertion. It seems to have rested
mainly on the fact that the property
belonged to a bankrupt and discredited
concern. And then as scandal had at
tached to the old French enterprise, tin
overly suspicious lent an ear to the chargi
that scandal as a hoodoo was still fo!
lowing.
Connecting the names of two such re
sponsible and reputable men as Dougla:
Robinson and Charles P. Taft with th<
matter made it still more unpersuasive
A hot presidential campaign was in prog
less, and the object was to Injure th<
republican ticket. But the object failet
utterly. In New York and Indiana
where the * revised story received iti
j largest circulation, the republican ticke
| was impressively indorsed. The voteri
| were not to he caught with such rani
: bail.
j The question arises, is it necessary, aftei
i this message, for Congress to invest!
i gate the charges? Have they not beet
sufficiently disposed of? The answer is
No. A vote by Congress would carry' ai
added weight to the business. Almos
i as much was known before the recen
! revival of the charges as is known now
I But that did not prevent the lugging o
' the allegations into the presidential cam
paign: and the Intention was to hav<

There would be no danger then of t

"Ik Marvel."
Fifty-eight years ago a young Nev
j England writer produced a little hook o
"reveries." They were totally diflferen
from anything that had ever been don<
before, being a series of intimate reflec
tions In the course of which a remlniscen
bachelor reviews his sentimental career
bringing to mind successively the womei
he has loved, and the pictures he ha:
painted in his mind of home happiness
The book reached the heart of the Amerl
can people Immediately. It became t
great favorite because it was somethini
every one could understand, somethini
elemental and wholesome. It has beet
printed innumerable times. passim
through scores of editions, and appearin)
In a great variety of "gift-book" forms
It has been, in fat". for more than half i
century, perhaps the most popular produc
of an American pen.

Santa Claus' Whiskers.
From ibe Philadelphia Ledger.
Thousands of Philadelphia children will
rejoice to learn that Santa Claus Is not
to be deprived of his ffowlng white beard,
which is no whit less Important than his
"ten tiny reindeer" or his well filled pack
to the proper observance of Christmas.
There was fear among the firemen at the
citv hall this year that Santa Claus'
whiskers might get on Are in his descent
of the chimney, and many wireless messages
were sent in the direction of Aurora
' Borealis in the endeavor to come to an
i understanding. For a while a clean.
shaven Santa Claus or none at all was
Imminent. He has. however, as a gracious
concession to the department of
* public safety, taken kindly to the sugt
gestlon that he shall wear asbestos
- whiskers in his visitation of the nur?
j series and Sunday schools of Philadelphia.
. It is simply another indication of the
notorious good nature of the old gentle*
man. He always was most self-sacrificing.
and so willing to put himself out
i that if he caught tire he would not have
had to trouble the firemen.

r From ibe Baltimore American.
t The Red Cross crusade is apparently
progressing finely, and popular interest
Is being aroused more and more in the
. fight against tuberculosis. There are so
many victims of this dread plague une
able to help themselves, for reasons of
e dire poverty, that the effort now being
. made to establish hospitals and provide
suitable treatment for them is one also
iu the interests of the entire community.
I Keep Things Stirred Up!
e From the HpriugtlelcJ Republican.
It's the general impression that it's
about time for William Dudley Foulke of
a Indiana to call Mr. Roosevelt's attention
again to something or other, just to keep

Caribbean Trouble.
v ! From tbe New TorU Mail.
rj The Caribbean sea is encircled by more
trouble than any other body of water in

of the matter is that most of the trouble
is picayune, save to the troublous and
