Shallow on the Absorbing
Subject of How to Ileduce

Elaine's Idea ot ireeiiif,' Tobacco From
Internal Duties The Whisky
Tax to be Used for Jhiihl-
injr Coast Defenses.
New York, Dec. 7. The Tribune torn or
row will contain a long interview with
lion. James G. Blaine on President Cleve
land's message. It was taken in short
hand under the direction of the Tribune's
Paris correspondent and sent by cable to
night. It i as follows:
"I have been reading an abstract of the
president's message and have been especi
ally interested in the comments of the
London papers. Those pap-rs all assume
to declare the message is free trade mani
festo and evidently are anticipa
ting an enlarged market for
English fabrics in the United
States :is a consequence of the president's
recommendations. Perhaps that fact
stamped the character of the message
more clearly than any words of mine
can."
"You don't mean actual free trade with
out duty?" queeried the reporter.
"'No," replied Mr. Ulaine, nor do theLo
don naners mean that. They simply me;
on
that the president has recommended whar
in the United States is known asa revenue
tariff, rejecting the protective feature as an
object, and not even permitting protection
to result freely as an incident to revenue
duties."
"I don't kuow that I quite comprehend
that last," said the report n
"I mean." said Mr. Blaine, "that for the
first time in the history of the United
States the president recommends retain
ing the internal tax in order that the tar
iff may be forced down even below the
fair revenue standard. lie recommends
that the tax on tobacco be retained, and
thus that many millions annually shall
be levied on a domestic product wnich
would far better come from a tariff on
foreign fabrics."
"Then do you mean to imply that you
would favor the repeal ot the tobacco
tax" "Certainly; I mean just that," slid
Mr. Blaine. "I should urge that at once,
1cfore the Christmas holidays. It would,
in the first place, bring a gieat relict to
growers of tobacco all over the country,
and would materially lessen the price of
the article to consumers. Tobacco, to
millions of men is a necessity.
The president calls it a lux
ury, but it is a luxury in no other sense
than tea and coffee are luxuries, it is well
to remember that a luxurj ot yesterday
becomes a necessity of todaj. Watch, if
you please, the number of iupii at work on
the larin. in the coal mine, along the rail
roads.in the iron foundry or in any Killing,
and you will find ninety-five out of 10M
chewing while at work. After each meal
the same piojmrtiou seek the solace of a
pipe or a cigar. These not ouly paj
the If millions of the tobacco tax.
but pay on every ping and over cigar an
enhanced price which the tax enables the
manufacturer and retailer to impose. The
only excuse ror such a tax is the actual ne
cessity under which the government
louud itself during the war, and the yea is
immediately following. To retain the tax
now in order to destroy the protection
which would incidentally flow fiom rais
ing the same amount of money on foreign
imports, is certainly a most extraordinary
policv for our government.
"vcll, then, Mr Blame, would you ad
vise the repeal of the whisky tax'""
"No; I would not. Otherconsiderations
than tlio-e of financial administration are
to be taken into account, with regard to
whisky. There is a moral side to it. To
cheapen the price of the whisky is to in
crease theconsumption enormously. There
would be no sense in urging the reform
wrought by high license in many .states
if the national government nutralize it
the good effect by making whisky within
the reach of every one at twenty" cents a
gallon. "Whisky would b everywhere
distilled if the surveillance of the govern
ment were withdrawn by the remission of
the tax, and illicit salescould u then be
prevented even by a policy as irons and
.searching as that w it h which Russia pur
sues the nihilists. It would destroy high
license at once in all the states. Whisky
has done a vast deal ot harm in the United
States. 1 would try to make it do some
good. J would use the tax to
satisfy our cities on the sea
boaid. In iew of the powerful letter
addressed to the Democratic party on the
subject of fortification by the "late Mr.
Samuel .1. Tilden. in 1SS5, 1 am amazed
that no attention has been paid to the sub
ject by the Democratic administration.
Never before in the history of the world
has any government allowed great cities
on the seaboard, like Philadelphia, New
York, Boston, Baltnnoie. New Orleans
and San Fiancisco to remain defenseless.
"But," said the reporter, "you don't
think we are to have war in any direc
tion?" "Certainly not," said Mr. Blaine.
"Neither, I presume, did Mr. Tilden when
he wrote his remarkable letter. But we
should change a i emote chance into an
i m possibility. If our weak and exposed
points were strongly fortitied; if today we
had by any chance even such a war as we
Lad with Mexico, our enemy could procure
lioncladsin Europe that would menace
our great cities with destruction or lay
them under contribution."
"But would not our fortifving now possi
bly look as if we expected var'f '
"What should it be more than the forti
fications made seventy or eight v jears ago
b our givmuiathers, when"they guarded
themselves agahist a successhil attack
from the armaments of that day. We
don't necessarily expect a burglar "because
we lock our doors at night, but if. by any
po:sibility a burglar comes, it contriimtes
vas'ly to our jeaee of mind and our sleep
to fee' that lie can't get in."
But alter iortihcations should be con
structed would ou still maintain the tax
on whisky?
"Yes' said Mr. Blaine. "s0 long as there
is v. hisKy to tax, I w ould tax it; and whe.i
the national government should have no
Use for the money I would divide the tax
among the federal union with the
specific object of lightening the
tax on real estate. "Houses
and farms of the whole
country pay too large a nroiwrtion of the
total io.es. If ultimate relief lould be
given m that direction it would, in nn
judgment, be a wise and beneticient policy.
Some ""holiest but misguided Iriends ot
temperance hae urged that the govern
ment should not use the monev derived
froth the tax on whisky. My replV is that
the tax on whisky by the leuenii govern
ment, with its suppression of all illicit dis
tillation and the consequent enhancement
of its price, has been a powerful agent in
the temperance reform by putting it be
jond the reach of so man v. The amount
f whisky consumed in the United States
r canim today is not more than -10 iier
cent of that consumed thirty j ears ago."
Beuie.s your general ami s'weeping op
position to the president's reeouuuenda
tioxi, have you any further specific abjec
objections'" "Yes; answered Mr. Blaine: "I should
seriously object To the repeal of the duty
l wool. Toe repeal that would work
great injustice to ninny interests and
uld seriously discourage that we should
ia nestly encourage, namelv, the sheep
culture among iarmer- throughout tin
I nion. lo break iow n wo.l growing and
Independent on foreign countries Jor tin
blanket under which we sleep and the
'-oat tlnrt covers our backs is not a wise
jwlicy for the national government to
uiiorce.
"Do you think if the president's reconi
l lendation were adopted it would increase
our exporttrade"
"Pos-jibly, in some few articles of pe
culiar constructions mi.;ht: but it woul
increase our import trade ten fold as much
in the great fabrics, in woolen and cotton
goods, in iron, steel, in all the thousand
and one shapes in which they arc wrought.
How are we to export staple fabrics to the
European markets, and how are we to
manufacture them cheaper than they do in
Europe unless we get cheaper labor than
thev nave in Europe?"
"Then you think that the question of
labor underlies the whole subject?"
"Of course it does," replied Mr. Blaine.
It is, in fact, the entire quostion. "When
ever we can force carpenters, masons, iron
workers and mechanics in every depart
ment to work as cheaply and live as poor
ly in the United States as similar work
men in Europe, we can, of course, manu
facture just as cheaply as they do in En
gland and France. But I am totally op
posed to a policy that would entail such
results, to attempt it is equivelent to a
social and financial revolution, and that
would bring untold distress.
"Yes, but might not the great fanning
class be benefited by importing articles
from Europe instead of buying them at
higher prices at home?"
"The moment," answered Mr. Blaine,
you begin to import freely from Europe
you drive out our own workmen from nfe
chanical and manufacturing pursuits. In
the same proportion they become tillers of
the soil, incrersing steadily the agri
cultural product and decreasing
steadilv the large home demand which is
constantly enlarging as home manufact
urers enlarge. That, of course, works
great injury to the farmers, glutting the
market with his products and tending con
stantly to lower prices."
"Yes, but the foreign demand for farm
products would be increased in like ratio,
would it not?"
"Even suppose it would," said Mr.
Blaine; "now do you know ihe source fiom
which it will be supplied!) The tendency
in Russia today and in the Asiatic posses
ions of England is toward a large in
crease of the grain supply, the grain
being raised by the cheapest possible
labor. Manufacturing, conntries will buy
their breadstuff's where they can get them
the cheapest, and the enlarging of the
home market for the American farmer be
ing checked he wouid search in vain for
one of the same value. The best proof is
that the farmers aie prosperous in propor
tion to the nearness of manufacturing cen
ters and protective tariff tends to spread
manufacturers. In Ohio and Indiana, for
example, though not classed as manufac
turing states, the annual value of fabrics
is larger than the annual value of agricul
tural products."
In reply to a suggestion by the reporter
that those holding the president's views
are always quoting the great prosperity of
the country under the tariff of IS JO, Air.
Blaine s-iid that it did not involve the one
des' motive point recommended by the
president, uamelv, the retaining of direct
internal revenue taxes in order to
abolish an indirect tax levied on
foreign fabrics. Besides this, the
Crimean war impaired the trade of
England, "France and Russia a that time.
Mr. Blaine then traced the cause of disas
trous events which marked the end of the
experience of Europe, with the tariff of
I MO. He noted the faci, that President
Polk implied Ui2 tr-asurv by free tr ide
tirilT under the same condition as prompted
President Cleveland to make the recom
mendations contained in his message and
said: "I trust nothing may occur to repeat
so disastrous a sequal to t he policy recom
mended by President Cleveland. But the
uniform fate has been for fitty yers past
that the Democratic party, when it goes
out .of power, always leaves an empty
treasury, and when it returns to power
always finds a full treasury."
"Pfi"iidoyou mean to imply that there
should be no reduction of the irttional
revenue"
"No. What I have said implies the re
verse. I would reduce it by a prompt icpeal
of the Tobacco tax and would make here
and there some changes in the tariff not to.
reduce protection, but wisely foster it."
"Would ou explain your meaning more
fully?"
"1 mean," said Mr. Blaine, "that no
great system of revenue like our tanlf can
operate with efficiency and equitv unless
the changes of trade be closely watched
and the law promptly adapted to these
changes. But 1 would make no change
that should impair the protective charac
ter of the whole body of the tariff
laws. Four jears ago, in the act of
1S, we made changes of the char
acter 1 have tiied to indicate.
It such changes weic made, and the forti
fying of our coast thus undertaken at a
very moderate annual outlay, no surplus
would be found after that already accumu
lated had been disposed of. The outlay of
money on fortifications, wliile doing gre.it
service to the country, would give work to
many men."
"lint what about the existing surplus?"
"The abstract of the message I have
seen," replied Mr. Blaine, "contains no
reference to that point I therefore, make
no comment further than to indorse Mr.
Fred Grant's remark that a surplus is al
wrys easier to handle than a deficit."
A LARGE SKELETON.
FoGAl.KS. A. T., Dec. 7. Yesterday some
Mexicans were digging a grave at the
cemetery half a mile north of town. The
skeleton of a human giant was uncovered
at a depth of two and a half feet. The
skull was accidently split in two pieces by
a blow from a pick. In size it is double
that of an ordinary skull, and the upper
teeth are veritable tusks, ranging from
three to three and a half inches in length.
From the stomach tooth to the swell in
the jaw it measures four inches. The
rapidly receding forehead, so noticeable
among the aborigines, is not a characteris
tic of the exhumed skull. A broad and
not overprojecting forehead strengthens
the belief that this was one of the prehis
toric men whose monuments of industry
still adorn th plains and valleys
of Arizona. While many of the bones
turned to dust as soon as they w ere ex
posed to the air, the ones connecting the
elbow and shoulder A" re intact. They are
monsters in length and thickness. Care
ful measurements of the skeleton place its i
neignt atMeet4't! incites. The preserva
tion of the skeleton for centuries may. seem
remarkable to some who are not acquainted
with the formation of the cemetery
grounds. At the period the body was de
posited there the soil was elavey, but not
of sufficient strength in itself to "form the
concrete now present there. It was only
by the admixture of extraneous . sul
stances, such as lime wash and pebbles,
that it became hardened. As this matter
was only deposited in the rainy season by
the slow mesa wash, centuries have, with
out doubt, come and gone since the main
moth corpse was placed to rest there in the
sleep of death. The bones of the giant
were reinterred in the concrete- soil where
they have been resting way bevond the
memory of man The skeleton will be
again exhumed and sent to a museum in
some city.

WASHINGTON.
(Continued f ron First Page.)
American policy of protection to which
the country is indebted for Its unexampled
development and prosperity. To demon
strate the injustice of the president's
policv and the fallacy of the remedy he
proposes for the reduction of the surplus,
we point to the fact that if the whole
amount of the revenue derived from wool
was abolished it would reduce the surplus
only about $3,000,000, or less than 10 cents
Eer capita of the population, which is paid
y foreigners, while the old war taxes he
recommends retained, yield over 119,000,
000 and as a direct tax per capita of 2
each, and is what makes up the
great bulk of the surplus of
c 1-10,000,000, which fosters a most danger
ous monopoly. We would further add the
following statistics in regard to the wool
industryT The annual revenue derived
from imnorts of wool under the tariff of
1S07 was less than S1.700. Under the re
duced tariff of lS'sS, the revenue last year
was over .,000,000. The number of sheep
in the country in 1884 was ."0,02G,(520, in
18ST it was 44?7,,314, a decrease of nearly
six millions, and a diminution of the an
nual wool products of over 33,000,000
pounds, thus showing that the reduced
tariff by the act of 1&3 has increaeed the
revenue from imported wools and dimin
ished the number of sheep in the United
States about 12 per cent and the annual
products in the same proportion. The
president's policy would bring about the
destruction of this industry and the same
policy of reduction and abolition of the
tariff would end in disaster to all the in
dustrial productive enterprises of the
country.
' CHRISTIAN ALLIANCE.
"Washington, Dec. 7. A general Chris
tian conference under auspices of Centen"
nial alliance opened today.
Ex-justice Stiong, of the U. S. supreme
court presided at the afternoon session.
Prof. Palmer II. Boyton, of Columbia col
lege made an addiess on immigration, He
believed that the time had arrived when
our former policy of indiscriminate ab
sorption of the foreign element of popula
tion, would result in a serious crisis. The
nation is no longer able to assimilate the
alien elements with sufficient rapid
ity. The children of aliens made a
terrible exhibition in the statistics of
paupery and crime. They constitute large
ly the hoodlums and roughs of our cities.
The public school have intoxicated men
with a sense of independence, without im
pression upon them the responsibilities of
liberty. The employers of labor, he said,
are able to defeat strikes by means of im
migration. .More competition with Ameri
can labor outers in a week through Castle
Garden than the, prisons turn out in a
year. Protection to American labor is a
tarce as longas this unbarred flood gate
remains open. Immigration lias the eltect
of lowering the grace of American civili.a
t ion, by introducing undue competitor! with
people who demand less of lite. He had
known Ilungaiians who saved money on
wags of .1 a day. They changed their
linen once a month and picked their din
ners out of ash barrels. Competition with
such people was impossible lor self-respecting
laboreis. People who live like pigs
olso presently behave like pigs. Prof,
l'oyseii said in conclusion that he was in
iaorof a law Avhich would make consular
inspection and a certificate ot good charac
ter indispensable prerequists to iminigra
tion. Practically such a law, in fact, as
proposed by Senator Palmer.
Hurst ot Buffalo spoke on the estrange
ment ol the masses from the church. The
cases he enumerated included the antago
nism of the foieigner to our evengelical
lite. Sunday newspapers, Sabbath dese
cration, and the greatest of all, the cities
of the saloon,
Rev. Arthur T. Pierson, D. D., pastor of
the Bethany Presbyterian church, in
Philadelphia, continued the discussion ot
the same subject, and said that the ten
dency of the rich is to get as far as they
can tiom the unwholesome and disagreea
ble surroundings of the poor. 1 found in
New York, he said, eighteen women; and
children, w hite and colored, occupj ing one
ioom. This blinded Samson of ignorant
and unevangelized labor, may get his
arms around the pillars supporting our
commonwealth ami bring it down.

DECISION REVERSED.
Washington, Dec. 7. The secretary of
the interior today reversed the decision of
the commissioner of the general land office,
and holds that the state of Colorado is en
titled to indemnity for two sections of land
lying within the Ute reservation, under a
grant of land to the state for school pur
poses. The members of the delegations from
Cincinnati and Omaha, who are in the

BARB WIRE TROUBLES.
Jolii.t, 111., Dec. 7. There is a strong
sentiment growing among the barb wire
manufacturers of this city, which is shared
by some of the manufacturers of St. Louis
aud other western cities, against paying
their royalty to "Washburn & Moen, of
Worcester, Mass., while so many un
licensed firms are allowed to run and pay
no royalty. Judge That's decision in St.
Louis about two years ago was adverse to
the-validity of the Washburn &: Moen pat
ents, and since that time a great many
moonshiner establishments luue sprang
up throughout the district coming under
the judge's jurisdiction. Washburn .v-Moc-n
are understood to be pressing the
unlicensed companies in the courts, but
the manufacturers here are growing rest
less and one of the most promiuent among
them said that it was the intention to form
a pool and contest the validity of the pat
ent. If the matter culminates the .Toliet
manufacturers will be joined by the
licensed firms in St. Louis and the'y will
save the money in law that they are now
paying Washburn & Moen a"- a royalty,
it is further claimed that this move" is "a
necessity, or the licensed mills will have to
shut down, as they cannot compete with
those who do not have to pay the royalty.

The Xatioual Soldiers Home to be Located
at San Monoca, Cal.
Las Vegas, N. M., Dec. 7. The board of
managers of the national home for disa
bled soldiers, at a meeting last night, made
their final decision on the question of the
location of the Pacific branch of the home.
The place selected adjoins the town of San
Monoca, Los Angeles county, California,
and is about fourteen miles from Los An
geles, and connects with the latter city by
two lines of railway. The land is do
nated by Senator- Jones aud Mrs.
A. D. B. Baker, and consists of
J500 acres. In addition to this -100,-000
has been granted by the trustees of
Wolfskill ranch which adjoins the Jones
and Baker tracts. The money is to be
paid by quarterly installments and -20,000
is to be devoted to the adornment of the
grounds. The construction of the same
will be proceeded with at once, and when
sufficient quarters are prepared for the vet
eran soldiers at Napa, the home will be
transferred to the national home if they
so desire. The buildings to be erected will
cost sl."0,000. The decision of the board
was by a vote of Y2 to 8. The party left
Las Vegas for the east today. During
their visit to the Pacific coast they had
visited ten different cities in California
and inspected tw enty sites offered for a lo
cation of the home.

CAPTURED A PRAIRIE WOLF.
CHICAGO. 111., Dec. 7. John Stetler, a
night watchman in the great lumber
yards along the North Branch, was ie"
turning to his home, 102 Orchard stieet,
in the rain Saturday morning, when he
saw a cadaverous looking beast loping up
aud down in f i out of his house. Stetler
was sure the animal was not a dog, io he
seized a club, bent his back, and started
after the stranger on the tips ot his to"s.
The morning Avas just breaking and the
stiest was deserted. Stetler circled around
the beast, which proved to b a long gray
prairie wolf, until he got within strik
ing distance, and then he made
a lunge with the club. The wolf leaped
out ot the way, and returning, snapped his
chops at Stetler. The watchman ran up the
steps of his house and Hung his club at the
beast. The latter galloped out of the way.
Then Stetler came down, aud with out
stretched arms approached the wolf. The
animal did not run away, but glared at his
pursuer. When Stetler got mar enough
the wolf snapped at his hands and caught
the left one in his teeth. Stetler yelled out
in pain, but with great courage tell upon
the beast which he seized by the throat
and dragged into the back yard. Then
Stetler locked up the animal and went out
in search of the owner. He was unsuc
cessful. The watchman is of the opinion
that the wolf walked into town from the
praire. The animal will be killed.
