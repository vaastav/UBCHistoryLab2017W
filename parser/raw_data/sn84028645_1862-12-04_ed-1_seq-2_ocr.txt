for having been often said, that the people of

-1 oaonot max. it better xnown man
ia, that 1 atrongly favor colonization. And
yet I wish to aay there la an objection urged
againat free oolored persons remaining in the
country, which la largely Imaginary, If not
aometlmea malicious. -
It la Insisted that their presenoe would In
Jure, and displace white labor and while labor
is. If there ever could be a proper time for
mere catob arguments, that time snrely Is not
now. in lime, use in. preseni, men euumu
utter nothing lor which they would not willing
ly be responsible inrougn lime ana in eierunj
u it trn. then, that oolored people oan displace
anv more white labor, by being free, than by
remaining slavesT If they etay In their old
places, tbey jostle no white laborers; If tbey
leave their old plaoes, they leave them open lo
white laborers. Logically, there is neither
more nor less of It. Emancipation, even with
out deportation, would probably enhance the
wages of white labor, and, vary aur.ly, would
not reduoe them. Thus, the oustomary amo.nt
of labor would still bav. to be performed; th.
fr.ed people would surely not do more tbsn
their old proportion oi it, ana very prooao7, tor
a time, would do less, leaving an increased part
to white laborers, bringing their labor Into
greater demand, and, consequently, enhancing
the wages of it. With deportation, even to a
limited extent, enhanoed wages to white labor
ia mathematically certain. Labor la like any
other commodity in the market inorease the
demand for it, aud yon Inorease the price of 11.
Reduoe the supply oi black labor, by colonis
ing the black laborer ont of the country, and, by
precisely so muoh, yon increase the demand
for, and wages or, wmie lanor.
Cut it Is dreaded that the freed people will
swarm forth, and oover the whoi. landt Ar.
tbey not already in th. land? Will liberation
make them any more numerous? Equally dis
tributed among tb. whites of tb. wbol. oonn
try, and there wonld be but one colored to
even whites. Could the one, in any way,
greatly dUurb th. sevenf There are many
communities now, baying mor. than on. free
eolcred person to seven white.; and tbls, with
out en v apparent consciousness of evil from It.
Tbe District of Columbia, and the Slates of
Maryland and Delaware, are all in this condi
tion. Tbe District has more then One free
oolored lo six whites; and yet, In lta frequent
petltiona to Congress, I believe It has never
presented tbe presenoe of free oolored persons
as one of its grievances. But why should
emancipation aouth, aend the freed people
north? People, of any color, seldom run, un
less theie be something to run from. Hereto
fur colored people, to some extend, have fled
north from bondage; ana nets, pernapt, irom
both bondage and destitution. But II gradual
emancipation and deportation be adopted, they
will have neither to flea from. Their old mas
ter, will give them wages at least until now
laborers can be procured, and the freed men, In
turn, will gladly give their labor for the wages,
till new homes can be found for them, In con
genial climes, and with people of their own
blood and race. This proposition oan be trust
ed on the mutual Interests involved. And, In
any evsnt, connot th. north decide for Itself,
whether to receive them?
Again, as praotlo. proves more than theory,
in any case, has there been any irruption of
oolored ueople northward, because of the abol
ishment of slavery in tnis visirict last spring?
What I have aaia or tne proportion of tree
oolored persons to tne wmtes, in tbe District, Is
from the census or 1000, nsving no reference
to persons called contrabands, nor to those made
free by tne act or tvongress aoonining slavery
bete.
The plan consisting of these artloles ia re
commended, not bnt that a restoration of the
national authority would be accepted without its
adoption.
Nor will the war, noi proceedings under the
proclamation of September 29, 1062. b. staved
beosnee of tbe recommendation of thla plan
Its timeiv taotium i aouot not, would bring re
storation, and thereby etay both.
And, notwithstanding tbls plan, the recom
mendation that Congress provide by law for
compensating any State which may adopt eman
cipation, before this plsn shall have been acted
npon, Is hereby earnestly renewed. Such would
be only an advance part of the plan, and the
ssme arguments apply to both.
This plan is reoommended as a means, not
in exolusion of, bnt additional to, all others
for restoring and preserving the national au
thority throughout the Union. The subject la
preaented exolualvely in its economical aspect.
The plan would, I am .confident, secure peace
more speedily, ana maintain it more permanent
ly, than can be done by foroe alone; while all
It would coat, considering amounts, and man
ner of payment, and time, of payment, wonld
be easier paid than will b. th. additional cost
of lb. war, If w. rely solely npon force. It la
much very much that it wonld ooet no blood
he plan la pre posed as permanent constitu
tional law. It cannot become each without th.
concurrence of, first, two-thirds ot Congress,
ana, auerwara, tnree-iourtns oi in. stsiee
Th. requlait. three-fourths of the States will
necessarily include seven of tbe slave States.
Their conourrenoe, If obtained, will give as
surance of their severally adopting emancipa
tion, at no very distant dsy, npon the new con
stitutional terms. This assurane. would end
the struggle now, and save tbe Union forever.
I do not forget th. gravity which should
characterise 4' paper addressed to tb. Congress
of the nation, by tb. Chief Magistrate of the
nation. Nor do I forget that some of yon are
my seniors; nor that many of yon hav. mor.
experience than I, In the conduot of publio af
fairs. Yet I trust thai In view of the great
responsibility resting npon me, yon will perceive
no want of respect to yourselves, in any nodue
earnestness I may seem to display.
Is It doubted, then, that the plan I Drowse, if
adopted, wonld shorten tbe war, end thus less
en its expenditure of money ana or blood? Is
It doubted that It would restore th. national
authority and national prosperity, and perpetu
ate both Indefinitely? . Ia II doubted that we
hereCongress and Juteonllve can aeoure Its
adoption? Will not tbe good people respond to
united, and earnest appeal from us? Can wa.
can they, by any other means, so certainly, or
ao apeediiy, aaaure thase vital objects? We oan
ooceed only by concert It is not - oan any of
ns fmffin setter " out "can we mu do bet
ter?" Obiecl whatsoever is possible, still th
question reenra "oan we do better?" The dog
ma, ef the quiet past, are inadequate to tbe
stormy present, rne occasion la piled high
with difficulty, and we most rise with the occa
sion. As our oase ia new, w we. muat think
anew, and act anew. We must disenthrall our
aelvea, and thsn we shall save onr country. . .
Fellow-citiaena, tss cannot escape history.
We, of this Congress and tbia administration,
will be remembered in spite of ourselves.. No
personal significance, or Insignificance, can spare
one or another of ns.! The fiery trial through
whioh we pass, will light as down- in honor or
dishonor, to the latest generation. Wa sas we
ere for lie Union. Tbe world will not forget
that we say thla. We know how lo aave the

Olds Elected by 2500
Majority.
Dr Olds was, on Tuesday, elected a Member
of tb. Ohio Legislature, by the invincible De
mocracy of Fairfield coacty, receiving Ihe ex
Inordinary majority of t tkoutand fit hund
red. Thla is one of the moat significant results
that we have had the pleasure to announce
since these perilous and troublous times came
to afflict the people of this country.
The Doctor wss illegally and unwarrantably
arrested at the midnight hourand forcibly re
moved from tbe State of Ohio to Fort Lafayette,
now one of the Bistilea of thla Administration.
There he bas been incarcerated for four montha,
in a damp and filthy cell, not knowing what
charges have been preferred againat him, nor
who bis cowardly aoonaert are. His repeated
demands to be pnt npon trial have been perslat-
ently disregarded; and be la still in prison, or
was a few dajs ago.
Now the loyal people of bla own county have
oast lor him by far tbe largest majority, for
Representative, ever before given there.' Tbe
result Is a condemnation, expressed In thunder
tones, of tbe whole system of arbitrary and
Illegal arrests. Hie malloioue and cowardly
assailanta and persecutors bad not even tbe
moral courage to run one of their oan persua
sion against blm. This fact glvea thelmmenae
vote polled .till greater significance. These
Isn't room enough In all the Government b se

The First S. C. V.—Rev. Col. Higginson.
A Boston jiispatch announcea that Rev. T.W.
HteuiMsoH, of Worcester, Mass., has accepted
tho Coloneocy of the First Regiment of South
Carolina Volunteers. Rev; Col. Hiosikso hsa
acquired some notoriety aa a preacher In Wor
cester, a lecturer of the radical stripe, and
a contributor to the Atlantic Monthly Hia c-
oeplancy of the above appointment ia a satisfac
tory Index to his politics.
This First South Carolina Regiment la com
posed of fugitive slaves, or as President law
com would express It, of "free persons of Af
rican descent." Tb. Rev. Colonel is, w. be
lieve, a white man with Afrloan proclivities
The regiment Is organised, we suppose, to aid
in pulling down the rebellon in South Caro
lina and In restoring that State to tbe Union.
It is the beginning of an experiment whioh
the Abolitionists particularly Gaitui have
been insisting should be tried. . aa they alleged
it wonld prove efficacious. ' We shall see how
It will work. We wait to hear of tbe gallant
exploits of the First South Carolina nnder the
command of tbe Rev. Colonel Hmminson, who
has yel to make a military, ae well as a tho
logioal and literary reputation. .
Perhaps it is not a aoppoaable oase, but if ll
were, we cannot help wondering, if a large
portion, aay a majority of the psopl. of Ohio,
were In rebellion sgslnsf the National Govern
ment, bow her oltlxso. would eel, should that
Government organise and arm a regiment of
bar free negroes and call it Ihe 1st Ohio. We
leave th reader, even were he a loyal man,
and opposed to the action of the rebel majority

The McNeil Murder—A Hard Argument.
The Cincinnati Qtuttt of Monday devotee
Its leader to a defenaeof "Retaliation for Rebtl
Atrocities." Half tho oolumn la given to a
Juatlflcatlon of Ihe fiendish and wanton murder
of ten oltissna or Palmyra, Missouri, by oraer
of General MoNwt. The OtuUt p.ralatently
denlea or Ignores Ibeaooredltedand well-known
facts of tbe eaeo, as presented to tbe pnblio In
nomarona lettera from that vlolnlty, and also in
article, from Union papers of thai Stale.
- It will be remembered that Ihe ten men
aalsed and ahot because Allsaun, alleged to
bav. been captured and held by the rebels,
was not returned within brief speoified lime,
were not r.b.l soldiers, bul oltlsens. Thai thsy
sympathised with Ih. rebels, and that some of
tbem bad been engaged In guerrillas, Is nol de
nied; but tbey were not then nnder arms, or
engaged In any open aote of hostility to tbe
Government.
Tbe wife of Allsman begged MoNiib to
spue these men for a few daya, and aee if her
husband would not return; bul her esrnesl en
treaties were Indignantly apnrned. Aluman
bas slnoe returned; be was In Illlnola at the
time; not In tbe band, of tbe rebels, but beyond
tbetr reach.
The whole proceedings were characterised by
tbe most heartless and fiendish atrooity. For
example, a young man, who had no family to
take oare of, came forward, and offered blm'
self, and waa aocepted as a substitute for I
friend who had a wife and children dependent
npon blm. No aimy officer, ao far aa the pub
llo has beard, has attempted to excuse or de
fend the conduct of MoNsjl; but several have
cat blm Id the most direct way. One wbom be
met tn St. Lsnis publicly refnsed to drink with
him; told blm he did not drink with murderers,
and that he was a disgrace to the service, and
endsd with giving his address for the conveni
ence of McNkil, If be thought blmaelf Insult
ed. Otber offloers among tbem Gen. Mo-
KiNi-rsr havs denounced bim lo bis face in
atrong terms, aud refused to acoept or renew his

These and otber facta have shown that tbe
killing of those ten man waa not justified by
toy rule of olvllised, eoaroely, of aavage war
fare, but waa simply a cold blooded and heart
less murder suoh as only a (lend could commit,
and thst it is ao regarded both in and ont of
the army. And yet strange to aay, the Qtzttlt
attempts lo defend aod justify It. Ita argument
la a pieoe of cheap and oommor sophistry. The
real faota of the case are Ignored, while false
soggestlons scd sssumptlons are substituted.
In tbls wsy the Oatetle prepares Itself to asy:
Tbey who sre on the side of the Government
for which Gen MoNell ia fighting, will natu
rally conclude that the bearing of all tbe cir
enmstsnoes wss toward Justification of his sot,
until the oontrary is shown. Tbe contrary has
not bsen shown. There is an effort to excite
publio indignation over tbia affair, to reflect
odium on the oause, bnt ll comes from those
whose prejudices are too much In favor of tbe
side for which Gsn. Porter is fighting, to per
mil tbem to tske a just view of the cue.
A paper, which finds itself driven to tbe ne
oejeity of excusing and defending that heartless
murder, might do well to give np the leek of
trjlug to find grounds for accusing Democratic
papers of disloyalty. Il will prove Vbor lost
Tat New York Espreu calls lor an inquiry
into the case of tbe three New Orleans clergy,
men, Drs. Liacooc, Fulton, and Goodmoh, In
carcerated In Fort Lafayette for the great crime
of omitting to pray for tbe President! It says
if they have violated any rnles or regulations
of their Church, let Its constituted suthorlUs
mete out an ecclesiastical punishment, but we,
the people, demand no connection with Church
and Slate, and if these clergymen have not
violated the Constitntion or tbe laws, their im
mediate rslease should be demanded as a right
guaranteed by the Constitution.
