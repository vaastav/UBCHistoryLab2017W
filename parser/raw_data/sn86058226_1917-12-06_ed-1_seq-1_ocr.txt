Wilson is More Than Match For Germany, Say Foreign Editors of His Message
LONDON, Dec. C President Wil
son's declaration in favor of war
against Austria is approved by the
Morning Post, which adds:
"We in this country can only say
that when America goes to war she
goes to war. She has the extraordi
nary fortune to be led by a president
of intellect, courage and determina
tion. President Wilson and Secretary
Lansing were more than a match for
the best diplomacy that Germany
could produce. America will be more
than a match for Germany and her
allies in the war.
"America is In a position to carry
her resolve to execution. Alike in men
and resources, skill and determination,
America is superior to Germany,
though she were fighting America
alone. Therefore, so far as human
provision can extend we are justified
in assuming the eventual complete
defeat of the enemy. But that is to
look ahead. It is the present business
of the allies to do their utmost in the
interval wfilch must elapse before

Find Targets For
Men Behind Guns
(By Associated Press)
WITH THE AMERICAN ARMY IN
FRANCE, Dec. 5 American army avi
ators are now working with the artil
lery and the results so far have been
most satisfactory to both branches of
the service. Yesterday, American air
men flew over a certain section of the
American zone and took photographs.
The artillery today started firing at
five separate targets located from the
photographs. The aviators took to the
air and the observers watched the re
sults of the firing, which was at a
considerable range.
The first shells fell wide of tha mark
but within four minutes the observers
were able to corect this with wireless
messages to the batteries, so that the
shells began to hit the location. Lat
er the observers had practice in lo
cating the other "enemy" with more
or less success.

Madame Gluck, Unable to Sing,
Disappoints Large Audience;
Promises to Return For Date
Alma Gluck was unable to sing at
the Coliseum Wednesday night. Her
voice had deserted her early in the
evening and all efforts to appease the
outraged vocal chords were in vain.
But she did appear before the disap
pointed audience and apologize before
taking the train for New York and
her own throat specialist. She was
the most disappointed person in tho
hall.
"Forgive me, forgive me," she im
plored of the audience. And the audi
ence, remarkably good-humored, show
ed every sign of forgiveness to the
charming prima donna.
"Even if I could sing tonight, you
would not hear Alma Gluck," she
announced.
Promises to Return
She promised to return and fill the
American forces are finally effective.
It is quite certain that Germany will
utilize every moment. .
"It obviously is her policy to force
a decision In the next few months and
the Germans, being fine soldiers, their
leaders being desperate men, and noth
ing being certain In war, they have at
least a sporting chance of success."
The Post then insists that the allies
must call upon every available man
and increase the production of guns,
airplanes and ships. It continues:
"Ireland must be brought under the
military service act. She can con
tribute at least 250,000 fine soldiers
who are spoiling for a fight If the
government does its duty like men and
at whatever cost, they will at least
have done their best. If they fail they
will fail honorably. If on the other
hand, they continue to dally and talk
and hope for tho best there will be
disaster. The premier has
shown he can take the lead, let him do
It once more or make room for a bet
ter man."

The Daily Mail says: "For all the
allies, President Wilson's address
makes very satisfactory reading His
ringing sentences, not less than the
measures proposed to give effect to
them, will do something in Europe, as
well as in America, to clear the air of
the fumes of pacifism. They set things
as Lansdowne's letter did not. In their
proper light and proper order."
Referring to President Wilson's per
sonal view, the Mail says: "No auto
crat In history ever enjoyed the power
and authority freely yielded to Presi
dent Wilson by the American people.
His voice is their voice; his thoughts
their thoughts to a degree that no
comparison with any European coun
try can quite parallel. Whenever he
speaks It is as though America, with
its hundred million people, blew a

immediately what are the ideals and

In the Cambral sector and on the

German efforts near Cambrai and east
of Asiago, the Italians are engaged in
a furious battle with the Austrian-Germans.

This newspaper refers to President
Wilson's adjuration to convince the
Germans of the falseness of their
leaders' expressed reasons for fighting
and reverts to its own advocacy of
the Marquis of Lansdowne's plea for a
declaration of war alms.

says the Daily Telegraph, "when we

WHEN MUNITION SHIP IS
BLOWN UP IN THE HARBOR
Flames Rage in Northern End of City, which Is Git
Off from Outside World Vessel which Caused
Blast Is American Storm Believed Responsi
ble for the Great Crash.
ST. JOHNS, N. B., Dec. 6. Large part of Halifax, is in flames
following an explosion in the harbor today. Two vessels, one load
ed with munitions, collided. Many buildings along the water front
were torn to pieces. Many person believed killed. Other shipping
in harbor suffered severely and crews of several said to have been
killed.
Wire communications between here and Halifax interrupted.
Only fragmentary reports recorded. The munition ship blown up
is said to have been an American. At moment of explosion a fierce
storm was sweeping the harbor and the collision was supposed to
be due thereto.
Later it was stated positively here that several transports
were in the harbor when the explosion occurred. Nothing as to
the fate of these is obtainable. It is not known whether trans
ports filled with troops or occupied only by crew's.
An unconfirmed report received at 2 o'clock this afternoon
said the fire at Halifax was under control. The origin of the re
port which was put on the telegraph wires could not be determined.
HALIFAX
For many years Halifax has been
the chief British military and naval
station on the American continent. Its
harbor, one of the most spacious in
the world, is large enough to float the
entire British navy and is strongly
fortified. In addition to the fortifi
cations, there is a government dock
yard containing an immense drydock.
The city's population, according to
the 1911 census, is about 47,000. Hal
ifax is the eastern terminus of the
Canadian Pacific railway and the Ca
nadian government railways. Steam
ship lines operate between the port
and points in Newfoundland, Great
Britain, the United States and the
West Indies.
Since the outbreak of the war, Hal
ifax has assumed a " more Important
position than ever, as It is the prin
cipal port from which men. munitions
and supplies are transported from
Canada to the battle fields of Flan
ders and Northern France.

Scores of people have been killed,
hundreds of buildings destroyed, and
a portion of Halifax set on fire by an
explosion which occurred after the
collision of an American ammunition
ship and another vessel at Rocking
ham, according to telephone mes

- The explosion was so terrific that
It destroyed the insulation in the
telegraph and telephone offices for
thirty miles around Halifax while it
was heard at Truro. 61 miles distant.
It is reported that the American
ammunition steamer was moving out
from her pier and was rammed broad
side by another vessel. Instantly
there was a tremendous explosion
which destroyed the two ships and
killed their crews.
Warehouses Damaged.
The concussion resulting caused
the roof of the railroad depot at
North street to collapse, while all the
warehouses on the water front for a
mile and a half were damaged. The
premises affected in many places
caught fire.
The force of the concussion was so
great that street cars were blown off
