Interesting Letters.
Charlotte The Cotton Region, tiff.
Ye And some interesting letters in the New York
'Times from Iforth Carolina. One is dated Char
lotte, N. C, Nov! 12th. We presume it is from
the pen of Prof. Henry E. Colton, who was hero
recently on a visit. He has done much to make
known the rich resources of this State.
$ye raake the following extracts from the letter
in regard to the situation in this ecjitn of North
&rolina:
"The streets here wear an air of life ami
ct;yjty; the live, working people oi the
"place and country have a look of cheeilul
11 ess and content. The reason it thai we
re now in a cotton region, which not only
produces lare crops of the great staple,
jbili jso makes nearly all the provisions it
consumes at any rate its coin and wheat.
Virginia is a land of tobacco and worn-out
farms. Here one seldom sees any strictly
worn-out lands, though there are acres
thrown out of cultivation from excess of
size in the old plantations. Tobacco is
.strictly a luxury ; cotton is a necessity of
domestic and commercial life, and is the
equivalent of gold. Cotton is grown only
in the Southern of all the United States ;
tobacco of tine quality is grown throughout
the North.
It is a notable fact that in the crisis oi
the present financial panic not one of the
Jiauks in North Carolina suspended, while
all did in Eastern Virginia, aud some are
irretrievably ruined. The intimate rela
tions existing between Richmond and New
York, and as a consequence the probable
mixture of the former in the same specula
tive vortex which overwhelmed the latter,
may have been some cause for the disasters
which have befallen the Richmond and
Petersburg banking institutions, but the
fact that the basis of banking in North
Carolina is cotton and naval stores, two
specialities, aud really gold crops, is one of
the chief reasons for the escape of the Caro
lina banks. Again, the greater portion of
.this State was settled by Scotch, a people
notably loyal in their personal and political
attachments. These people are slow to
-lose faith in the men in whom they have
placed confidence. We heard of one old
Scotchman who, when told in 1857 that the
banks would all break and lie would lose
.the money he had in the Haukof Cape Fear,
said of a prominent cashier of that institu
tion: ""i e canna tell me the money's not
safe in Archie's hands." The same olficer
is now cashier of a national bank in this
State, and I venture that not one of his
Scotch constituents have at any time feared
jto keep their money in his vaults. Such
confidence in New York would have saved
half the trouble.
The cotton region of North Carolina may
.be said to embrace all the country east of
the railroad from Danville to Greensboro,
except Randolph county and parts of Moore
and Montgomery, while several counties
west of the road must be included. The
area of cotton lands in the State has been
much extended since the war, though it is
probable so many acres have not been culti
vated, yet in proportion to acreage and labor
there has been a greater product. To a
greater extent, loo, provisions used have
.been raised on the farm, and the excellent
idea is every year gaining ground that to
make cotton king, bread and meat must first
be made at least prime ministers. Those
planters who, this year, have raised cotton,
and have no corn to buy, are well off; those
who need buy neither corn nor pork are in
first-class condition, while those who have
raised all their provisions and have no labor
(to pay are perfectly independent. I am
pleased to say that in over 1,000 miles of
travel in this State I have found more of
the latter class than I expected. Those
who pay their labor in a share id the crop
are also independent. One small planter
told me that he had made fourteen bales,
or 0,300 pounds of lint cotton. At ten cents
"per pound he was making $11 on each
bale, and counted in the labor of himself
and sous at good wages. He was not in
debt, and was selling a couple of bales only
o get a little money, coffee, sugar and fancy
artioles. In addition, he had his seed, which
he told me was better worth $40 per ton to
him than all the guano was $20. It is plain
that a State of such planters can defy the
world. The greater portion of North Caro
lina cotton planters approach to or belong
to this class. Upper South Carolina is
joniing into the same line, and the North
Georgians, with their Yankee shrewdness,
long ago adopted . these ideas. With all
articles of use down in proportion, under
this system cotton may be made at a hand
some profit for twelve'and a half cents per
pound. Hut there is another side to this
picture. My friend, who did so well, made
)is own manure from barn-yard stuff, leaves,
swamp-mud aud cotton seed, in compost,
and raised 225 pounds of lint to the cre,
7ut many have bought superphosphate and
guano, aud produced less. When the gieat
mass of Southern people follow his example
ana use tnc vast storehouses if fertilizer
iiAturp nn mi f in il
forests, they will become fuliy independent.
On many plantations the second picking
is even yet in the boll?. That this is a
suicidal policy does not seem to enter the
niindspf the planters. They say that they
cannot afford to pick it, yet llo not be
lieve they would give it to any one who
would take that tronble and expense. The
cost of picking: is about one cent per pound
i) the J int. I have seen, everywhere, on
my routes of travel, fields white with cot ton,
so much is the picking delayed ; but so far,
nature has been kind, and the rains have
been few and the frosts hardly worth men
tioning. For instance, I find here, constant.
y, the roses and other flowers in full bloom
in the open air. Thus favored bv nature, a
better spirit may prevail, aud most of this
i)Ow-w&tiug wealth be saved. I urn inform
ed that the" same state of affairs exists in
'Georgia and other Southern States. The
crop ot cotton in this State has been lare
,iu quantity, and the staple, especially in this
section, excellent in quality. Judges have informed
me that the staple here this year should rank one
grade higher than last year. From varied sources
of information I a informed that the crop on the
grrat cotton belt of Alabama and .Mississippi is a
failure; tne season has bean too wet on these low
lands. A gentleman of this place, who owns a plan
tat ku between Montgomery and Eufaula, gavs he
will hardly make the seed he planted. But on all
the uplands of the cotton States the crop is good and
the efforts of intelligent men to improve the quality
of the fctuplo there raised are giving good results.

ten on. That brains and money did not al
ways run in the same channel; that he
wanted brains in this great work as well as
money.
Mr Cowles favored the amendment; he
thought there was a solemn warning con
tained in the history of recent railroad
frauds and defalcations, and he for one
should not feel that he had discharged his
duty until he had voted for every reason
able safeguard for the protection and secu
rity of the people's money. As the bill

Look out for such Rascals. -
The latter part of last April, Joseph G.
Bennett, or a person sailing under that aliast
appeared in the Cove Creek neighborhood,
VVatuaga county, as a singing-school teach
er. Without any difficulty he made up
two classes; one at Cove Creek and one at
Antioch (Baptist) Church." Locating at
the Rev. Mr Herman's he was at once re
ceived in the best families. His popular
manners aud christian deportment soon
gaiued him many warm friends. While
engaged in teaching he professed religion,
joined the Baptist church. He became
deeply interested in the Sabbath school
and was made Superintendent. He was to
all appearance deeply pious, ever and con
stantly conversing on religious topics.
The 20th ot August last, he was married
to Miss Sarah Grider,whose parents live on
the Watauga river and number among the
most respectable people in the upper sec
tion of Watauga county. Soon after the
marriage, news reached the neighborhood
that "Bennett" had a wife living near
Statesville, Iredell county.
Bennett feigned great indignation at the
report, and promised the injured parties tbe
most irrefragible proof of its diabolical
lalsity. He earnestly looked at it in thy
light of persecution, or as the temptation of
the "Evil One." He proposed to visit
Statesville aud obtain from the Clerk of
the Court the evidence of innocense, when
he would return and inflict a highly
merited chastisement upon the busy tongues
of slander that had so fouly beslimed his
christian character. He left Watauga
county on this mission, in September, and
since that time has not been heard from.
A letter has been received in the neigh
borhood from the father-iu-law of Bennett,
slating that his lawful wife is still living.
The letter from which we gather these par
ticulars does not state name of the father-in-law.
Bennett's picture accompanies the let
ter, from which it appears ho has but one
arm, sandy-colored whiskers under chin,
long bony face, sunken cheeks, florid com
pleclion, high-forehead, light, sandy hair
and almost bald.
His face shows him to be the hypocritical
scoundrel he is, with brass and shrewdness
enough to impose upon .the most suspect
ing. We publish this at the request of the
injured parties, hoping that in giving it
publicity the villiau may yet be overcome.

The New Chief Justice. Hon. Geo.
II. Williams of Oregon, the new Chief Jus
tice of the Supreme Court of the United

a poor boy. He emigrated when a youth
to Iowa, and entered a lawyer's office and
served as a clerk for some time. He got
his license, went into the practice of law,
and rose to be Judge in Iowa. He was
then appointed by "President Buchanan
Chief Justice of Oregon Territory. After
a time he was sent to the Senate from Ore
gon. At the end of his terra he was ap

Some of the Southern papers are discuss
ing the propriety of having the next Presi
dent come from their part of the country
and Alexander IL Stephens of Georgia,
seems to have been mutually agreed upon
as a suitable candidate. There are not
bones enough in the body of tho dauntless
little Southern giant and he has nothing
else except skin and brains upon his frame
and head work to make a respectable rattle
in the contribution box of a country church.
But his friends will have their say, never
theless; and it will uot be the first time
if they succeed, that he has been offered a
similar distinction, and that too, by a regu

not generally known in our political histo

r, Terrible Shipwreck.
The London ship LaernoiJ" tain, from
New York; arrived at Cardiff, bringing in
telligence of the dreadful disaster .U the
steamship Ville du Havre, which left New
York November 15th, for Havre, under
command of Capt. Luomont. At 1 o'clock
on the morning of the 23d of November,
the Ville du Havre collided with a British
ship, from London for New York, and sank
shortly after. Two hundred and twenty
six of the passengers on the steamship lost
their lives. The Laemountain rescued
eighty-seven of her passengers and crew
aud brought them to Cardiff.
London, Dec. 1. -Later dispatches from
Cardiff bring the following additional par
ticulars of the loss of the steamship Ville
du Havre. She was struck amidships by
the Lachearn and sunk in twelve minutes
after the collision occurred. The Lachearn
immediately lowered three boats which ren
dered all the service it was possible for
them to do. Fifty-three of the crew were
saved, including the Captain. Among th
passengers rescued were ten women.
Among the passengers per the Ville du
Havre were Judge Peckham and wife, of
Albany, New York ; Mrs. Edward Curtis
and maid, Mr. R. D. Wilthaces, Jr., Cap
tain C. Hunter and wife, Miss t Caroline
Hunter, Mr. Cramer, of Waterforu. Sara
toga county ; Thomas Hammond, wife and
three children, Mrs. Mary Bulkley, of Rye,
Westchester county, accompanied by her
daughter and by Miss Wagstaff, of Long
Island ; Mrs. Bulkley, is among the saved,
but the young ladies are understood to have
been lost, as Mrs. B. telegraphs that she
alone was saved. There were also among
the passengers the following members of
the Evangelical Alliance, returning to their
homes: Rev. Antonio Carvasco, of Spain ;
Professor E. Pronier, of Geneva, Switzer
land ; Rev. N. Weiss, of Paris ; Emile
Cook, of Paris, and Mr. Lovriere Alfred
Barban, son of the Belgian Legislation at
Washington, was also a passenger.
At the time of the collision the weather
was clear and a little wind was blowing,
but there was a heavy sea. The captain
had just retired and the second officer was
in charge. The lights on the steamer were
all right. The collisiou was wholly unex
pected. The Lachearn struck the steamer
amidship, aud made a chasm twelve feet
deep, ami from twenty-five to thirty feet
wide. The exact position of the steamer at
the time was latitude 47, 21 ; longitude 35,
31.
A panic took possession of the passen
gers soon after the collision. The main
and mizzen masts fell across two large
boats, which were filled with people and
ready for launching. The boats were
crushed and many of their occupants killed
and injured.
In the brief interval between the colli
sion and the sinking of the steamer, the
crew were able to launch only a whale boat
and the captain's gig. The Lachearn went
a mile before stopping, and then she got
out four boats to pick up the people strug
gling in the water. In the meantime the
second lieutenant of the steamer picked up
one load of those who were clinging to
planks, spars, etc., and took them to the
Lachearn. The lieutenant's boat returned
to the scene and rescued another load.
Captain Surmont, who remained on deck
to the last, was rescued by this boat. One
of his officers swam a mile to the Lachearn,
and was hauled on board with a rorc
The boats continued to search the water
in the vicinity of the disaster until ihere
was no hope of saving more lives. The
cold was intense, and many of the survi
vors were in the water two hours, aud
were almost lifeless when rescued.
New York, Dec. 2. Special dispatches
give the following of interest about the
loss of the Ville du Havre. Most of the
passengers were too terrified to try to save
themselves. Many prayed aud many laid
down with the calmness of utter despair.
Some hearing the water pouring into the
ship never quitted their state rooms.
Whole families thns went down together.
The four boats lowered by .the Lachearn
found passengers and crew floating on the
waves, holding to planks, buoys, spars and
whatever could be seized as the wreck went
down. Many had thus prepared them
selves from the first. Many of the women
saved were floating in the water. The
Captain of the Ville du Havre is reported
to have been quite exhausted by his three
days and nights of uninterrupted duty.
The officer who was in command when the
collision took place was lost. The suffer
ings of those who were rescued was intense,
the cold being very severe. Many persons
were nearly insensihle, and would have ut
terly perished in a few minutes more. The
rescues were nearly all a matter of haphas-
ard, as time permitted no organized effort
or attempt at choice. Ihe purser of the
steamer says, that in a few minutes the
ship began to sink, amidst great disorder
and frantic terror. The scene was awful
and beyond all description. The air was
rent with shrieks, but some were heard say-
Ting calmly "As we must die let us die
nobly." Ihe water rushed into the hold
with mcreditable velocity. I undressed
myself and with a companion iumied over
board and swam towards the Lachearn,
when half a mile distant. As I left I heard
the ship cracking, and looking back saw
her go down with one plunge forward.
For a moment shrieks were terrible, then
all was silent. Alas it was the silence of
death.

The President's Message.
President Grant's annual Message was read in
Congress pn the 2d inst. Instead of filling up six
or eight columns of our paper with it, we think the
following synopsis will give the reader a good idea
of the opinions and recommendations of the Presi
dent. The President message opens by a re
ference to the financial crisis and the Vir
ginius matter, which latter he say3 is in
course of negotiation and likely to be ami
cably and honorably arranged. It refers
to the Vienna Exposition which was credit
able to the artisans of the United States;
to the reception of the Western Ambassa
dors by the Emperor of China, aud to the
need of further legislation to suppress tho
infamous Coolie trade. It recommends a
commission for tho purpose of auditing and
determining the amount to be paid for
losses caused by the Confederate privateer.
It refers to the mixed commission for deter
mining claims between British subjects and
Americau citizens, and asks for an appro
priation to pay the amount of decisions
against the United States. It also recom
mends a law creating a -special Court of
three Judges to hear aud determine all
claims of aliens against the United States,
arising out of acts committed against their
persons and property during tho insurrec
tion. It asks the decision ot Uongress on
the subject of the action of the Ottoman
and Egyptian Governments relieving for
eign consuls of judicial power.
The President transmits the application
of the Republic of Santo Domingo that the
United States shall exercise a protectorate
over that Republic. The message discusses
at some length the question of the right of
naturalization, particularly as to citizens of
the United States residing permanently
abroad with their families, and suggests
legislation on the subject. It refers to the
establishment of a Republic in Spain and
the efforts of the new government to abolish
slavery- in all its dominions, which efforts
are opposed by the reactionary slaveholder
of Cuba, who are vainly striving to slop
the inarch of civilization. 1ms baleful in
fluence had thus far succeeded in defeating
ihe efforts of all liberal-minded men in
Spain to abolish slavery in Cuba, and in
preventing the proposed reform in that Is
land. In the interest of humanity, of civi
lization aud of progress it was to be hoped
that the evil influence might be soon avert
ed. In. reference to the capture of the Vii
ginius ami to the inhuman and illegal mur
der of fifty-three of her passengers and
crew, he says that the Spanish Government
had recognized the justice of his demand
and had arranged for the immediate deliv
ery of the vessel and for the surrender of
the survivors of the passengers and crew,
and for a salute to the flag and for proceed
ings looking to the punishment of those
who may be proved to have been guilty ot
illegal acts of violence towards citizens of
the United States aud also towards indem
nifying those who may be shown to be en
titled to indemnity. The correspondence
on the subject had been conducted m
cypher and by cable, and was therefore
uot in a condition to be submitted to Con
gress. The President expresses his conviction
that the existence of African slavery in
Cuba is a principal cause of the lamentable
condition of the Island, and dtes not doubt
that Congress shares his hopes that it will
soon be made to disapper, and that peace
aud prosperity will come with its abolition.
lie suggests two constitutional amend
ments, one to authorize the President to
approve so much ot any measure of Con
gress as his judgment may dictate without
approving the whole, and the other to pnv
vide that when an extra session of Congress
is convened by executive proclamation, le
gislation shall be confined to such subjects
as the executive may bring before Con
gress from time to time in writing.
He recommends the erection at Washing
ton of suitable buildings for Cabinet officers
and for such officials as now receive com
mendation for quarters, thus setting exam
ple to States which may induce them to
erect buildings for their Senators.
The message goes very fully into the
financial question, and declares that tho
country never can have permanent pros
perity until specie payment be reached.
He recommends legislation prohibiting na
tional banks from paying interest on de
posits and forcing them into a resumption.
if only in tender notes. He suggests the
.: ...i. . .
quesuou wueiner oanKing should not be
made free, but securing all the present safe
guards to bill holders.
He notices the improvement in American
ship building during the past year, and
hopes tor a continuance of it. In ierard to
the problem of cheap transportation, he re-
A. a 11 ' 1 Tit -i
lei io me .cne ana Illinois canals, and
suggests whether it would not be wise
statesmanship to pledge to the States, that
own these canals, that if they will enlarge
them, the General Government will look
after and keep in navigable condition the
great public highways, with which these
canals connect, to wit, the Hudson River,
the. at. Clair flats and the Illinois aihI
Mississippi Rivers.
He recommends a government explora
tion of the upper Amazon River and its
tributaries; a revision ami codification of
the tariff laws and the opening of more
mints. He endorses the recomendatiou of
the I ost master General for the establish
ment of postoffice saving depositaries, ami
invites the consideration of Congress to the
proposition for a postal telegrauh. He re
commends legislation in regard to tli in
dicia! proceedings iu Utah, and also in re
gard to the bankruptcy law, which he con
siders as productive of more evil than good.
If not totally repealed it should be modi
fied in those portions providing for involun
tary bankruptcies. Those portions should
be repealed. He calls attention to the im
mense aggregate of claims against the Gov
ernment, many oi them growing out of the
leotMiion and not a few of them fabricated
and supported by false testimony. He re
commends that persons having claims be
required to present them at an early period,
and that the personal attendance of wit
nesses be required by the Court of Claims.
In regard to the Indian question he re
commends a territorial form of Government
for the Indian territory. He" also recom
mends Rnch action as will permit the settle
ment of a body of Russian Colonists on the
public lands, and endorses the proposition
tor a census in 1875. He eulogises the.
Washington board of i-mViK .
i r.L r""w work . ,
speaks of the great improvement of tT
under the operations of the board it tUy
commends a liberal policy on the rs
Congress in defraying a portion of ? n of
pensea and suggests the estahl; u x"
of a National University. iuhm
he passage of an enabling act for th
mission of Canada as a State, aud Ljf"
the opening of a canal for the pnrpL l'

In conclusion, he renews his record
datum for a general amnesty, and
there are a number of persons yet labori?, 5
under disabilities, very small, but en0i ?
to keep up a constant irritation. There c
be no possible danger to the Governm,?!
