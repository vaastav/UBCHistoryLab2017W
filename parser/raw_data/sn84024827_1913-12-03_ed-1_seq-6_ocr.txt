CHAPTER IX.
Moving the Pawn.
At breakfast next morning. Rosalie
opened her game opened It like a
master of human chessmen, with a
trifling move or two of the pawns.
( "Don't any of you people be as
tonlsbed," she said. "If your clothes
look strange and orderly when you get
'home tonight. This Is my day for
cleaning closets. I announce now that
if 1 And anything Isn't hung where It
ought to be, I'm going to set It right."
"When they were gone. Rosalie Le
Grange, refusing assistance from Mrs.
Moore, put on dust-cap and long apron
and mado good her word. But she did
more than clean. From Miss Hard
, lug's apartment on the ground floor to
.Hiss Hstrllla's on the top, she exam,
"ined minutely every garment and
every pair of shoes. "When she had
finished, when she stood In her own
room dressing for the street, she
looked very1 serious. Before she put
away her house-dress, she took from.
Its pocket the red shoo button. She
Inspected It again, and locked it away
In the deepest compartment of her
-ewel case.
Rosalie walked brtekly tc a book
fctors In the heart of the foreign dis
trict, held short consultation with the
, clerk, journeyed another block, and
stood at length before a sign lettered
In many tongues. She hesitated and
began talking to herself.
"You can't teach an old dog new
tricks," she remarked.
"But sometimes you can brush up
the old tricks he used to know," ebe
added. "It'll take time well, any
way, I'm here!" and she entered.
When she emerged. It lacked but
half an hour for lunch time. At the.
table, she made subtle Inquiry about
the plans of her boarders for the day.

There must be genuine merit to an
article that has stood the test of two
generations of users.
In tho field of medicino nolo has
"had greater success, nor retained
that success to a greater degree, than
Dr. Caldwell's Syrup Pepsin, which is
now being used by three generations
of people. Its use In families Is con-
stactly becoming more general. The
reason, primarily, U that it has merit.
It is what It represents itself to be.
a laxative-tonic; It does not make
exaggerated claims nor uso coarse
l-miage to set forth Its virtues.
it Is a medicine, bat so mild and
f o- tlo a medicine that thousands of
mothers give it to tiny infa-.ts, and
yet. In ft slightly larger dose. It Is
equally effective for grown-ups. It is
for any disorder of tho stomach, liver
or bowels, for dyspepsia no matter
how chronic, for biliousness, sour
stomach, gas on the stomach, head
aches, drowsiness after eating and
similar complaints arising from a
clogged-up condition of the bowels.
It la pleasant to the taste and does
not gripe. It can bo used with safety
and good results by anyone at any
age or in any condition of health,
and that person's health "ill Improve.
Every druggist sells it and the price
is only fifty cents and one dollar a
bottle.

WASHINGTON. Dec. 2.-Fear of
bringing on a revolt which might give
to America a militant suffragist or
ganization, caused the leaders In the
National Woman Suffrage association
to abandon today their efforts to have
adopted the new constitution reported
by tho revision committee appointed
a year ago.
Today's session of the 45th annual
convention of the association ran al
most entirely to discussion of the pro
posed revision of the constitution. The
question was debated nearly six hour
without bitterness or personalities.
Although there was no mention of
it on the floor ot the convention of
President Wilson's failure to mention
woman suffrago In his message to
congress today, there was much crit
icism heard pbout the hall. Two
prominent leaders, 'Mrs. itedlll Mi
Cormlck, of Chicago, and Mrs. James
It Laldiaw, of Xew York, issueJ
formal statements verifying the dis
approval of the president's course.
Dr. Anna Howard Sha.-w, prea dent
of the National association created a
sensation at tonight' session of the
convention when she declared Presl.
dent Wilson had fallen short of the
greatest opportunity he ever had or
ever Tvould have. In falling today to
say a word in behalf of Woman Suf
frage when he read his annual mes
sage to congress. Her remarks re
voked loud and prolonged applause.
