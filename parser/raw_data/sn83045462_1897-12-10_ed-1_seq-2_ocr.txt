It was stated in reliable quarters about

such objection in a number of special bills
so-me of which would go before the House

th? r bureau stations in the northwestern

in this section, where the bureau stations
do no. exist. It was explained that they

Another point to which he called their
attention was th need of an increase of

I n 1 that if the microscopical examina

LATE NEWS BY WIRE
Effect of the Election of Judge
Barley.
HOW REGARDED IH RICHMOND
Considered as a Victory for the
Gamblers.
ACTION CONSIDERED ASSURED
Special to The E.vnins? Stir.
RICHMOND, Va., December 10.?The
contest over the Alexandria and Fairfax
judgeship, it is understood, is practically
seitled. and th_>re is little doubt now that
Louis C. Barley will be chosen. This is
thought to be a step toward victory for the
sporting people, including the managers of
St. Asaph's race track.
The impression prevails here that some of
the strongest supporters of Mr. Bailey are
interested in racing in Alexandria county.
Senator Boy kin of Isle of Wight and S.
Brent of Alexandria wrote a letter to
Joseph <\ Willard of Fairfax, member ot
the house, and who is in charge of Judge
Love's light for the judgeship, agreeing to
kave the matter to Senator Mushback.
If he would second the nomination of
Barley, Love's supporters would support
that gentleman, or if he would second the
nomination of Love, Barley's supporters
would \ote for Love.
Mr. Willard declined to agree to this, and
Senator Mushback announced today to one
of his friends that he wouid support Bar
ley.
The interest in tl is contest was greater
than any other on account of the fact that
the jurisdiction of the judgeship included
St. Asaph's race course and some of the
gamblii g dens opposite Washington, which
Gov. O'Ferrall has so long made war on.

still growing weaker. It is not thought
that the end will come for some little time,

only a short time during the latter part of
the night, and resumed his vigil in the sick
ro?>m during the forenoon.
He remains almost constantly at the
bedside and always within call at a mo

Mr. Abner McKinley at about the same

SAX FRANCISCO. December To.?A most
peculiar case of a woman leading a double
life came to light here when Henry M.
Frustuek. a grocer of this city, had his
wife, Mary, and Wm. Wristland arrested
on a charge of bigamy.
Frustuek married iiis wife at Los Angeles
in lSXti. He moved to this city in with
his wife and little boy. Four years after
ward he learned by accident that his wife
had married his own brother. Frank Fru
stuek. He secured a divorce for cruelty,
in order that the facts should not come
out. The woman constantly appealed to
him for aid and also to see her little boy,
and as his brother had died she finally in
duced him to remarry her last June
Frustuek had a friend named Wm. Wrist
land, who owned a yacht in which he took
parties out on the bay. He invited Mrs.
Frustuek several tim*s to go with him.
Finally, in August, the yacht, Wristland
and Mrs. Frustuek disappeared. The hus
band made a search for his wife and finally
found that she had been married to Wrist
land at Martinez in August. The woman
had taken his child, so he kidnaped it and
gave it to his mother. Then he had the
woman and Wristland arrested.

STRONG DESIRE TO KILL.
lle:iry Nenhlt'n Thirst for Blood Main
tained to the End.
Spot lal Dispatch to The Evening Star.
IRWINVILLE, Ga., December 10.?At 11
o'clock this morning the trap was sprung
which launched Henry Nesbit, colored, into
eternity. Jim Harrington was the victim
whose death was thus expiated. The
cause was jealousy of the smiles of a black
amazon, who stood in the crowd today to
watch the fate of her former lover.
Before the black cap was placed over his
eyes, Nesbit spoke ramblingly, declaring
that the white race had always been friend
to him, while he owed all his trouble to
numbers of his own race.
"If I should get clear," said he, "I would
kill nine negroes."
Nesbit has quite a record as a desperado,
and nine homicides are laid to his charge,
all of whom were members of his own
race*. In fact, he seemed to be afflicted with
a mania for killing negroes, and alwavs
prided himself in the fact that he was" a
white man's negro and a gentleman. The
negroes looked upon his execution with
deep satisfaction.
ZANOLI LOST MANY WIVES
But He Was Always Consoled by Their
Life insurance.
Xcw York Ilarber Voder Arrest for

SeriouH Crimes.
NEW YORK, December 10.?Charles
Zanoli, the barber who yesterday pleaded
guilty to defrauding an insurance company,
and who admitted that since 1883 he had
collected insurance on four wives, one
mother-in-law, one daughter, and one em
ploye, was arraigned in police court again
today on the charge of being a suspicious
person. He was remanded until tomorrow
to give the detectives on the case time to
thoroughly investigate his record, and as
certain whether the lives of all these peo
ple, whose insurance Zanoli obtained, were
lost through natural causes. The charge
made by the insurance company will not
bo pressed until this curious sequence of
deaths has been thoroughly explained.
Zanoli was very pale when in court today,
but behaved in a self-possessed way. He
asserts that all the persons on whose lives
he collected insurance died from natural
causes, but admits collecting $355 on an in
surance policy taken out in his own name
after he had represented to the company
that the dead body of an employe named
Schmidt was himself. While prosecuting
his insurance business Zanoli sometimes
traveled under the names of Braune and
Suhmer. The police have many theories
and strong suspicions of foul play, but no
definite evidence has vet been procured to
warrant the charge of murder.
When Zanoli was searched $1,000 in bills
and a bank book with an account of $500
in it were found on him. He also had a re
volver. which he said he carried to protect
himself against some one who had threat
ened to kill him. He refused to tell the
name of this person.

Iniportnnce of k Conservative and
Forbearing* Conme la Treating?
the Cuban Question.
Some of tha> most conservative and re
liable men in Congress are cliscus{4lng the
Cuban aituatioii?more properly the Spanish
situation?very grayely, and say that they
expect that bofora rlong the wisdom of the
recommendations- on the subject by the
President in his message will be apparent
to every one. They say that the situation
is such as to render the most conservative
and forbearing- course consistent with the
dignity of this government the wisest and
most patriotic that can be followed, and
that every effort should be and will be
made to hold Congress down in the matter.
This opinion is presented with confidence
that such a course will hinder or retard
the independence of Cuba, but will serve
as a bulwark of strength to this govern
ment when the crisis arrives that is ex
pected.
The dispatches from Madrid indicating
that Sagasta and the new Spanish ministry
cannot sustain themselves against the
popular antagonism to the autonomy plan
and the expressions quoted from Sagasta s
speech on that subject were not unex
pected to the administration. The Presi
dent, it is asserted, was not at the time of
the writing of his message ignorant of the
desperate position of the Sagasta minis
try, and it was realized that popular
clamor against a policy of conciliation
might at any time drive Sagasta to seek a
quarrel directly with the United States.
With such a prosj>eet in view, it is regard
ed as 01 the greatest importance that this
government should appear in the eyes of
all nations as not the aggressor, but as
having been patient and forbearing even
to an extreme degree.
Attitude of the Spanish.
One of the best informed and most con
servative men in the House said, in a
serious private discussion of the situation
today, that there was great probability
that Spain would soon try to fix a quarrel
upon the United States. "The Spanish,"
he said, "are in desperate straits both at
home and in Cuba. Cuban independence
is now practically assured. The autonomy
expedient is recognized as a failure even
by Sagasta, both on account of the refusal
of the insurg nts to accept it and because
of the ui popularity of the scheme anion#
the Spanish themselves. It is a foregone
conclusion that the cortes will not ratify
the decree of autonomy, and it is realized
that the very existence of the Spanish
government would be threatened by per
sistence in the policy.
"The belief is entertained that th'* Sagasta
government will he driven to seek trouble
with the United States in order to eseape
popular condemnation at home and to avoid
the humiliation pf cl? feat by the Cubans
alone. The adg&iiitet ration realizes that
events are temflffig.in that direction and
the President foresaw the probability of it.
when he wrote his message. Spain cannot
seek and could not get the assistance oi
any foreign government in her efforts to
subdue the insurgents, but the Spanish
have hopes that it' the United States could
be placed in the attitude of an aggressor
and be drawn into the fight, some outside
; assistance for Spain migh. be secured. It
is regarded ns probable that Spain will
take aggressive action herself, in the ab
sence of provocation from this government,
but in that event no foreign country could
find an excuse to participate as a sup] orter
1 of Spain, it is for this reason that the ad
ministration takes the position it does and
that all possible efforts will be made to
! prevent provocation being given by Con
gress."
Opposition to the Spanish Minister,
A story comes from New York that the
I Spanish colony in that city is divided on
the question of the retention of Senor de
I Lome as the Spanish minister to the L'nit
' ed States. Shortly after the assassination
| of Premier Canovas a petition was sent to
Madrid asking for .a strong successor to
Senor De Lome. The petition was drawn
I so as to attack Senor De Lome without
mentioning his name, and among tiie forty
prominent Spaniards who signed it were
several friends of the minister, who lid not
see an attack upon him in the apparently
harmless recommendations. The result is
a strong bitterness among the factions,
j The petition speaks of the desire of the
' American people for the success of the
| Cubans and of the necessity of Sj#ain giv
i ing "the United States to understand that
| not only it knows how to govern its own
i affairs, but that it is resolved to govern
them as it ehooses."
| The so-called enemies of Do Loine are led
by Senors L. F. Auja and A. Taltovuli, who
I charge the minister with lack of foresight
and weakness, with peimitting Americans

to the Senate Their opponents ire led by
E. Terans, formerly vice president of the

A PAINTER'S FATAL FALL
Bobert A. Pumphrey1 s Death Results From
an Accident.
Wn? at Work nt a Seeond-St?>ry Win
dow anil Dropped to the Pave
iii on t?skull Fractured.
Robert A. Puniphrey, a painter, thirty
four years old, met with a fatal accident
while working at No. 444 S street north
west, about 9:45 o'clock this morning. He
fell from the second-story front window to
the iron porch below, fr icturing his skull
and breaking his left arm. The police am
bulance happened to be in the vicinity of
the house where the accident occurred, and
the victim was taken to Freedmen's Hos
pital. He died just as the hospital was
reached.
The deceased lived at No. :as Armory
street southwest with hie wife, but had
no children. His father was in the paint
ing business in this city more than thirty
years ago, and two of the victim's brothers
survive him. One of them drives a bakery
wagon and the other is in New York.
Pumphrey w is working on a house owned
by Airs. M. I,. Hcover, and occupied by Mr.
and Mrs. i\ 1,. Hampton. About two weeks
ago Mrs. Hoover met the painter on the
street, and his app<arance saused the belief
on h'T part thai he was in need of work.
The lady offered him work and he willingly
accepted. Two days later he went to
work painting four houses for Mrs. Hoover,
and the latter was pleased with the work
to such an extent that she advanced him
money with which to care for his family.
This morning when he appeared at the
house ready for duty Mrs. Hoover noticed
an improvement in his dress, and she was
more pleased than ever to see that the
man to whom she had given employment
had not thrown away his earnings.
Heard n Noise.
He went to the second story of the
Hampton residence and started to paint
the front window. Mrs. Hampton was in
the dining room in the basement at the
time, and a few minutes after Pumphrey
ascended the stairs she heard a peculiar
noise.
"What's that noise?" she was asked by
her colored maid.
"Nothing, I guess," was her answer.
Thinking, however, that there was some
thing wrong Mrs. Hampton went to the
front door, where she witnessed the shock
ing sight of the dying man lying on the
sidewalk directly in front of her house.
Blood was streaming from his mouth and
nn.se. Mrs. Hampton's screams aroused
persons in the adjoining houses, and her
maid w<*it out to make the dying man :.s
comfortable as possible. About this time
tiie police ambulance, in charge of Driver
Oliver, stopped in front of the house. Two
siek patients in the ambulance were taken
out and seated on a doorstep and the ve
hicle was soon on its way to the hospital
with the Injured painter.
When the doctors at the hospital pro
nounced the man dead the wagon turned
away and the body was taken to the
morgue.
Coroner Notified.
Coroner Carr war. notiii. I of the accident,
and he had tin- police of the eighth precinct
niak- in investigation. H i? likely that no
inquest will be held.
MISHAP TO PHOF. AI.CKU.
Hurt While Handling a llun ?t the
Nii\y Department.
Prof. Philip it. Algt r, professor of
mathematics of the navy, met with a
serious accident at the Navy Department
about " o'clock this afternoon. He and Li ut.
Dashiell of the navy were discussing the
merits of the new Lee rill" adopu 1 by the
I'-avy, and to illustrate a point he wis mak
ing, Professor Alger picked up a ritle stand
ing near by and began to manipulate it.
It contained a live cartridge, and it is
supposed Prof. Alger was not aware of
that fact. He is an expert in gun mechan
ism, and was supposed to be able to handle
Unarms in all conditions without danger
to himself, so that the fact that the rifle
was loaded did not enter enter into consid
eration at all.
In some w?y, n ?: yet explained, r.is ex
periments resulted in the unexpected dis
charge of the weapon. The bullet struck
the iron easing of the window frame and
chipped off several small pieces of the
metal, one of which, about two inches
long, struck the professor on tin* forehead,
just above the rigni eye, severing the tem
poral artery.
Lieut. Dashiell was struck on the body
by several pieces of the metal, but was
not hurl. Seeing his companion's condi
tion, he pressed his finger to the wound,
temporarily checking the flow of blooi,
and summoned assistance.
The accident happened in the library ad
joining the ollice of the chief of the bureau
of ordnance. Professor Alger was carried
to a sola in the latter cftice and was soor
under the care ot Surgeon General Van
Rcypen red Surgeons Boyd and Green, and
Col. Alden, assistant surgeon general of the
army.
it was tound that he was not so seriously
injured as was at first supposed, the skull
rot having been fractured, and the missile
merely caused a severe laceration.
The injured man r, sponded readily to
treatnu nt and was able soon aft**r to be
removed to his home. SCSI Hiliyer place.
The affair created considerable excite
ment among the employes of the State,
War ;ind Navy Department, as it was re
ported that the accident had resulted
fatally.

Bears Had Full Sway on New York

THE ENTIRE LIST HAMMERED DOWN
London Selling the Only Reason

GENERAL MARKET REPORTS
Special Dispatch to The Evening Star.
SEW YORK. December 1??.?The stock
exchange transactions today represented
large realizing in the entire list, with con
sequently a setback to the upward move
ment. The trading was quite active
throughout the day, and the result is a loss
of one point, ami in some stocks two.
The selling movement that was started
yesterUay by I?ondon continued very vigor
ously from tl.at center today. The early
cables reported lower figures f??r American
stocks, but the local market acted contra
dictory to these quotations, and opened
higher. This high opening the foreign
brokers took advantage of, and sold in
large quantity s, which caused a decline
from opening quotations and encouraged a
general realizing movement amongst the
entire list, which continued throughout the
day.
There was no particular news on the
market, and nothing locally to influence
realizing.
The reports of earnings for the first week
of December continue to keep up with the
previous weekly statements.
Manhattan on realizing declined very
rapidly from l??S:t-8 to 1?M? f-4, at whicn
figure there were a number of buying or
ders, and a recovery of half the decline
was scored. The decision of the appellate
court was expected today, but up to de
livery hour it had not been received. As
to what it will be there Is not much
doubt.
Northern Pacific preferred was very
heavy throughout the day. hut it was dur
ing the early trading that the heaviest de
cline was made on stop orders. The an
nouncement of the dividend was expected
today, and its non-appearance encouraged
the traders to let go.
The transactions in Sugar were some
what neglected, and also w? re the rest of
the industrials; consequently the decline
amongst these erratic specialties was not
as great as the loss to the grangers. Su
gar. however, succcoded in losing a point
on trading that was strictly professional.
The loss to the grangers was due to real
izing:.
The foreign exchange market was steady
and unchanged. There was a good supply
of both grain and cotton bills, but th?* de
mand was light, coming chiefly from ar
bitrage houses.
I ievious to the close th* market rallied a
little, but although regaining somewhat,
it closed with a loss for the entire list

ion that the dogs of the ? ity have too
much freedom, and he will eni? ivor to
secure, through the Com mis-. ? ' ??is, lie* en
actment of a law which will r?^*rain th??

the masculine pander, the tax at the pres

The health officer does not desire to be
understood as wishing to exterminate the
dogf, l?ut he feels that there are too many
here for the safety of the people. That
many could be done away with. He also
feels thai common decency requires that
the law In relation to dog* should l?e
amended in the lines suggested by him.
Another thing which he will probably
urge is that dogs of a dangerous kind or
disposition shall not be permitted to run
at large under any circumstance*, an 1 that
when they appear on the streets they be
in charge of som?? responsible person and
securely restrained.
