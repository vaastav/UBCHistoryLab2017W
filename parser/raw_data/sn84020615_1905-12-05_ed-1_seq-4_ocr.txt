MARKET MAKING
Maxwell's Talisman, which has somewhat lost caste
by Us opposition to the president's plan for congressional
regulation of railway freight rates, must stilt ho Riven
the palm for 11a dauntless. Indefatigable, and nhle activ
ity In the matter of Irrigation for file arid regions. In
Us latest Issue that paper says:
In a reeent address Secretary Wilson staled that the
settlement of the Mississippi valley created a home mar
ket which was worth more to the manufacturers of the
United States than the markets of till the rest of the
world. It waa their own market and thpy did not have to
compete for Its trade with other manufacturing nations.
If the Mississippi valley with Its thirty or forty million
of Inhabitants largely occupying farms of 1 (. 200,and BOO
acres affords the best market in the world, what would be
the reclaimed arid west where irrigation doubles and
trebles the yield and farmers make fortunes out of twenty
and forty-acre tracts? Desert land, when it Is provided
with an adequate water supply, jumps In value from a
dollar to a hundred dollars an acre and the created value
of the American desert when irrigated with the flood wa
ters which now run to waste, would he not far from ten
thousand minion dollars, a valuation too stupendous for
Intelligent conception.
The most remarkable and wonderful feature of the
Irrigation development of the government lies In the fact
that the cost of this great work will all be repaid to
the government. The first completed national irrigation
work was announced last June a small patch of 50,000
acres and it Is significant that long before the. water
from the big government ditch waa turned upon the land,
every acre under It had been eagerly taken up by settlers,
In 80-acre tracts, under agreements to repay the govern
ment every dollar expended in the work.
THE MESSAGE
The presidents message appears In this Issue of The
Citizen absolutely unabridged and set In our own office.
It Is said to contain some 30,000 words, anfl The Citizen
takes this occasion to say that every word Vif it deserves
the careful consideration of every intelligent, country
loving American. With the exception of the civil war,
there have never faced thig republic graver questions
of a national character than those which now demand
atention of our lawmakers; and upon the manner in
which they meet and discharge their obligations, will
depend the destiny of our country and its growing mil
lions for many ages. President Roosevelt, In his mes
sage, calls the attention of congress to these questions;
and he does so with a wisdom and moderation born of
careful study, large view, able grasp and unprejudiced
conclusion. The American people may well ponder his
words.

8 Oneness of Arizona!
Andl New Mexico
O From St. Johns, Arizona, Herald.

(live- the points of similarity between Arizona and
New Mexico, prehistorlcal. The remains of prehistoric
man In both territories, as far as discovered, go to show
that the people of those days, now denominated "Cliff
Dwellers." "Plains Dwellers," "Aztecs." etc.. were In
habits, customs, arts and pursuits, Identically the same.
dive the points of similarity of these two territories,
historical. The Spaish explorers visited the two; they
found the same conditions existing In the two, the same
climate as today; the same almost in everything. The
Spanish founded settlements ami the people now called
Mexicans grew up in both territories alike. These con
quered in large degree the savage tribes nnd blazed tho
way for the present civilization, in both. ine 1wo ter
ritories were alike embraced in the colonies of Mexico,
and remained such until acquired by the United States
either by conquest or purchase. They remained as one
territory until divided by the United States government
in 1863. Both are still under the control of the United
Slates government In a sense, the property of the gov
ernment. Give the points of similarity of 1he two territories,
industrially. Two great transcontinental lines of rail
way puss through each; with a third building through
both. Irrigation Is employed In farming enterprises of
each. The products of the soli nre very much the same,
embracing thrtse of the temperate and sub-tropical zones.
Sheep and cattle raising are profitable industries, and
have been for jears the principal source of commercial
wealth, in both. Iloth have been the scenes Of opera
tions at the hands of the prospector, until now when the
ninlng industry is assuming large proportions, the pre
cious metals In Ar'zona and the industrial minerals of
New Mexico are reciprocally profitable to each other,
business men being Interested in both territories. The
man In overalls Is the producer of wealth In each. The
non-resident or alien capitalist Is draining each of lis
wealth, under present arrangements, while but a few
capitalists are trying to develop and improve the ter-
Itories.
What are the points of similarity In the matter or
population? Perhaps about nil nationalities are repre
sented In both, with many from the different states of
ne union residents. Each territory Is a factorv for
making American Patriots. The people of eacn are
patient, hospitable, and long su.Tering. and have uowers
of endurance second to none. They are enterm islne and

ROAD STORY
Governor Broward, of Florida: I am thoroughly In
sympathy with the great national sentiment in favor of
curbing bribers and bribe takers. I have already called
the attention of the law makers of the state to this crim
inal and un-American practice and expect to do ho again
in my message to the next legislature. In my 'opinion,
these grafters can be best detected and punished by a
strong law, making the practice a felony, and exempting
from punishment, and therefore compelling to testify, the
person who accepts or is offered the bribe, In order that
the greater criminal, the man who has placed the temp
tation In the way of his fellow man, may be certainly
reached and punished. I am Btrongly In favor of state
insurance control and recommended such a plan to the
last Florida legislature, and will urgently recommend It
In my next message to the legislature.

Governor Cutter, of Utah: I am In favor of the
strictest laws consistent with true' freedom for the con
trol of life insurance. I think the grafters will be puu
Ished under the criminal law now on the statute books.
The matter-is before the great state of New York, and
1 think jwe can trust to the officials of that state to do
their duty. It may be well lor the government to take
the matter of insurance under hs supervision. have no
opinion to offer on thai question Just now. I may be
counted on to assist In every reasonable way in cheek
ing any tendency toward fraud,' bribery or corruption in
the in.sur:nci juslness or In any other line. But 1 think
calm r.n.t cool judgment should prevail, and the facts
become fully known before drastic action Is taken or

N. O. Murphy, of Arizona, is reported as saying tue
other day in Washington, D. C: As long as that obnox
ious proposition (jointure with New Mexico) is before
congress, I shall be in this vicinity, seeking to oppose it
by every legitimate means. The people of Arizona 'are
against it overwhelmingly, and if a fair expression oi
the sentiment of New Mexico could 1 taken, a majority
or its people would be found in the negative. Arizona
is rich and prosperous, and there is no other cloud on
its' horizon save this threat of being forced Into a most
distasteful partnership. if wo cannot be admitted as
a state on our own Individual merits, all we ask is to be
allowed to remain as we now are.
New Mexican: The office of I nited States marshal
for New Mexico Ib one or the most desirable places
within the gift of the president, and at this Urne, us far
as known here, there Is no telling who the lucky man
will be. At one time the office of United States marshal
was of great political power in this territory. This
happily has changed for the bejter, and outside of pro
vlding one man and a few of his friends with Mood places
the position Is not of much consequence to the ieol
at large. It looks as if the present Incumbent, c, M
Koraker, will succeed hlmsolf.

Curing Dread Curse
of L.amif Corastumraptioim
ooacCKocoox
A tuberculosis exhibition is a feature at the New
York Museum of Natural History, and it tells a tale of
the triumph of science, stranger than Action a tale
which so far as possible should be made a part of every
citizen's education. It shows the career of the dread
disease from the dark unventilated room In which it is
born to the final catastrophe. It shows the means by
which It can be Combated, and, better still, the means by
which It can'be prevented. Fresh air and sunlight are
the cure. The exhibition contains lessons in the rela
tion of food to the cause and cure. Cases far advanced
ure being nourished, aired and lighted back to health.
Every enterprise that has for Its object the extension
of knowledge concerning consumption and its cure is to
lie welcomed. That scientific men should possess defi
nite knowledge is not enough. No great progress can
be made until the general public understand the simple
rules of right living, which alone can baffle the disease.
In the United States the death rate from tuberculosis
Is frightfully high, as compared with that of other coun
tries, and Is said to be increasing. Iji Europe the con
quest lias been steadily advancing. In Prussia statistics
show that at the present rate of decrease deaths from
pulmonary tuberculosis will entirely cease in 20 years.
In 1 8S7 the drop began, and 'be death rate from this
cause lias decreased since then from 31 to 21 per M.OOO
population. In England, In the same period, the drop
has been from 24 to 19. If has been demonstrated be
yond auy doubt that lu consumption's ealier stages cures
may be effected In almost every case, and that even after
tho disease has made marked headway its ravages may
be stopped, the patient grow strong enough to do a full
day's work and get full enjoyment of life seven days in
the week, and live to an advanced age, to die at last of
other disease. The positive assurance that this can be
done, and Is being done in thousands of cases. Is the best
medicine that can be offered to a discouraged consump
tive. Hope is the best tonic there is. It Inspires one
to fight, and not succumb, and that is half the victory.
However, while every word of the foregoing is true,
It must not be forgotten that the most important ele
ment in the cure of consumption of the lungs cannot
be shown in the New York or any other, exhibition. That
element is climate. Sunshine, aridity, altitude, purity
of atmosphere and absence of extremes either of heat or
cald these things in connection with cleanliness, outdoor
life, exercise, proper food, avoidance of all excesses, will
multlDlv nrobabilltles of recovery an hundred fold: hut
without thetilinate, recoveries through the other agen
cies will be few and tar between.

OOCKC000CKC0C
As a matter of fact, most people who suffer from
chronic aliments can be cured by almost any means from
which they confidently expect relief. It Is from among
this class of persons that the cures made by Christian
Scientists ure recruited. Tho healers only persuade
their patients that they have nothing the matter with
them, and straightway they begin to get better and even
tually are entirely relieved. At least as many patients
have been cured by Christian Science as by osteopathy
In ibis country. Were the ailments of such persons,
therefore, imaginary? Not entirely. Their sense of
discouragement, however, prevented their nervous sys
tem from exercising sutikient control over certain tis
sues to enable them to throw off low grade pathological
processes. If the mere influence of suggestion, the only
remedy of Christian Science, can accomplish so much,
It is easy to understand how much may be expected from
similar suggestion aided by the Influence of tho mind
in the repeated, systematic manlpulatloa of an osteopath
in whom confidence Is reposed. The chronic sufferers
who become the vaunted cures of the osteopath now
belong to the same class that have always In all ages
enabled the irregular practitioner of medicine to point
with Hide to his cured patients, and so gain new adher
ents for bis system. In all the history of medicine,
however, not a single therapeutic measure of enduring
value has ever been Introduced to the notice of the med
ical profession In this way.
The general public seems to think as Dr. Still bints,
that tho regular medical profession is opposed to osteo
pathy as a method of treating disease. Any manipula
tions that will aid In the cure of disease, any rubbings
that by favoring the circulation to certain parts will re
lieve symptoms, any massage or other physical meas
ures that will help suffering humaulty, the medical pro
fession is not only perfectly willing, but even ready
