Weather Conditions.
The storm area yesterday off the

Cascades, but the weather in the in

is causing heavy rain, and thunder
storms in southern Arizona and snow

in the eastern half of the United
States. There has been a considerable
fall in temperature in the intermoun

Walla Walla is the lowest of the win

continued fair weather in this vicinity

JOHN GROVER, Observer.
HAY WILL GET THE JOB.
It' seeTns that Mr. Kay spent a lot of
money advertising himself as a repub
lican aspirant for the lieutenant-gover
nor's job; and now there are some
people who would interpret the pri
mary election law, which is one of its
haziest passages prohibits candidates
froru playing the advertising game,
as disqualifying Mr. Hay from holding
the office t'o which he was elected. If
Hay can't have the job. why. it is reas
oned, Mr. Coon, the present incumbent,
will hold on.
' Of course, anyone with half an eye
can that this is but a skirmish in
the big light which is soon to be pulled
off for the governor's cha'-r. It is now
realized tliat Cosgrove, whom the
people named as governor, cannot live
to serve his term, even if he lives to
be inaugurated. If Cosgrove dies be
fore inauguration day, it is generally
believed that' the present governor, Al
bert E. Mead, who was defeated at the
primaries, will continue in the position,
unless the legislature should call a
social election.
Rut if Cosgrove lives to be inaugu
rated, and Hay is inaugurated, the
Wilbur man will stand an excellent'
show of inheriting the governorship
before his term expires. Just now, the
lieutenant-governorship is a big prize,
and if Hay can be disqualified. Coon
will hold on That Coon hopes to fall
heir to the executive office is undeni
ably true.
But back of it all remains the cold
tvard fact' that the people chose Cos
grove for governor. Knowing the
probable importance of the position,
they chose Hay, for lieutenant-gover
nor. If Cosgrove fails to serve out
his term, the succession, by all the
rules of common decency, belongs to
Mr. Hay.
And The Evening Statesman ven
tures guess that 'in such an event,
Mr. Ha.v will get the job.
AND COXGRTSS LAUGHED.
If the reports from Washington are
to be believed,, congress did not get ex
cited about the president's les majes
te message yesterday. The} United
Press report' has it that "the senate
enjoyed as a huge joke a. part of the
mesage". and that Vice-President
Fairbanks , somewhat "lessened the
merriment jn some degree by rapping
for order." The Associated Press, or
dinarily mire conservati\*>, declares
that' "repeated peals of laughter"
greeted the reading of the' message.
It is little wonder that congress
laugher—it is a healthy sign that con
gress should laugh when the president
of the Vnft'ed States proposed that
newspapers which criticize his action
should be muzz ed by placing the pro
prietor in jail.
The World aptly states Mr. Roose
velt's position when it says:
"This is the first time a president
ever asserted the doctrine of les ma
jeste or proposed, in the absence of
specific legislation, the criminal pros
ecution by the government of citizens
•who criticised the conduct of individu
als, who may have had dealings with
th?. government. eXither the king of
Great Britain rrcr the German emperor
would venture to arrogate such power
to himself. John Adams' attempt to
enforce the sedition law destVoved the
federalist party in America. Yet, Mr.
Roosevelt, in the absence of law, offi
cially proposes to use all the powers
of the greatest government on earth
to cripple the freedom of tlie press on
the pretext that the government itself
has been libelled—and he is the gov
ernment."
Rack of all this, however, is the
fact that' Mr. Roosevelt retorts with
personal abuse and cries of "stop
thief," when at the outset all that was
wanted was a plain statement of facts.
But* as long as congress laughs at
such silly outbursts, the country can
probably survive such displays of
Rooseveltism.
WHEN THE PREACHER LEAVES
THE PULPIT.
The Chicago Inter-Orean contains
a leader of criticism of the conduct
of the Rev. Charles Aked, pastor of
the Fifth Avenue Baptist church of
New York, who left his pulpit and
made- the assertion that "both the
great American political parties were
so evil that it was impossible to say
which was the worst."
Discousing-'upon the propriety of a
ministers leaving his pulpit for politi
cal purposes. The Inter-Ocean contains
the following very sarcastic criticism:
"A comparison of the president of
the Unittd State:*-to a 'tree toad' by
a wellknown female agitator was
among the other amenities of the oc
casion.
"Earlier in the day there had been
a suffragette riot at a meeting of
women who opposed woman's suffrage.
"At this meeting the Rev. Dr. Ly
man Abbott had read a letter from
the President saying in substance that,
while personally not opposed to wom
an's suffrage, he did not consider the
question immediately important.
"Dr. Abbott, although a preacher,
had some excuse for his appearance in
this political controversy. For some
years he hffs been only nominally in
t'he pulpit; he ,appeared chiefly as a
messenger; and his wife was one of
the leaders of the original movement
against woman's suffrage.
"But the utterances of Mr. Aked,
who is by present vocation a preacher
of the gospel, and whose only status is
as such. must move laymen to inquire
w.hat was thhe call that brought this
gentleman from England to our shores.
Was it to preach the gospel or to pro
mote political agitations? Did he come
to save souls or to make stump
spopchos of doubtful credibility on
woman's suffrage? The questions an
swer themselves.
"We do not doubt that Mr. Aked is
persona'ly a good man of the most
benevolent intentions. And therefore
he illustrates well what happens usual
ly to the preacher who leaves the pul
pit and yields to the suggestions which
incessantly beset him to become a po
litical cat's paw.
"The first thought of the authors of
any risky or desperate political scheme
is to cloak it with respectable names.
And what name more respectable than
that of a minister of the gospel? The
office to which he is set apart at once
gives the impression that he is an
honest man who would not counten
ance %vrong.
"And so with the best intentions the
preacher often becomes a promoter of
diorder, misinformation, and even
falsehood. Read Mr. Aned's words;
they point the lesson.
"Such is the risk run by the preach
er when he leaves the pulpit and for
gets that his business is with the souls
of men and their he
forgets that his mission is not to fight
in the political arena or to wrestle in
the market place, but to preach the
| gospel of Jesus Christ that by its
power men may be turned from their
sins and led to a better living."
Pin-haded policemen and mayors in
the northwestern part of the state have
resumed the manufacture of anarchists
by refusing to allow Emma Goldman
to speak in their towns and by throwing
into jail at every turn of the road.
"Why is it that all of the country
newspapers haven't mentioned the
fact that "we are glad to se our old
friend, the Congressional Record, on
our exchange table again"?
And Mr. Roosevelt just can't under
stand how anybody would dare to say
anything back to him.
But' probably Mr. Pulitzer enjoys the
advertising—just the same as any
newspaper would.
Uneasy lies the head of the city em
ployes these strenuous, economizing
days.

Cohan's shows are noted for their
dash and vim, for the helter-skelter
promiscuity with which he introduces
characters and scenes, for the "catch"
of the-! songs, regardless of melody.
"Little Johnny Jones" is no exception,
it' is a play as full of life as George
Cohan's imaginative mind can make
it. Prom curtain to curtain the breeze

freshness that is really invigorating
and while the laughs are noc produced
in over abundance there is plenty of
mirth in t'he show. It's a good show,
good enough.
William Keough, the "The Un
known," is far and away the best char
acter in the cast. His part could hard
ly have been taken in better shape and
the laughs chat came were) from the
dry wit' in his lines and his inimitable
way of speaking them. A better drunk
man was never on the stage here. He
was "soused" from first to last and
carried the jag well. Charley Brown as
"Little Johnny Jones" made good. It
is hard to see why everyonei who takes
a part created by Cohan feels in duty
bound t'o put his whole nose in his
voice; but it seems that is the case.
Brown did it along with the rest of
them, did, it well for that matter;
but originality is to be preferred to
imitation, even though it is done to
flatter a big man. Charley Brown can
Use his feet some, and did it i* time or
two last night in whirlwind style.
Aside ,from these two the cast was
very good, but not brillianc. It was
well balanced and did first class work,
but there were no stars among t'he
rest. The reformers who were the
cab girls also, are a pretty bunch of
feminity and composei about ell the
good looks of the chorus.
Several good song hits were intro
duced, among which was Cohan's great
song "Yankee Doodle Boy." Mr. Brown
sang this through his nose—as Cohan
does, we suppose—but he didn't' spoil
the song, which is one of the catchiest
ever. " 'Op in Mte 'Ansom" was another
cleverly staged song and "Give My
Regards to Broadway" the last of the
trio that made a particular hit last
night'. One other thing should be
praised, howeiver, and that is the finale
of the second acts. It was great, one
of the prettiest that has been staged
here this year and won hearty and
most well deserved applause.
"Babes In Toyland."
"Babes In Toyland" last night de
lighted one of the largest audiences of
the season at the Union, says the
Daily Missoulian. Every bit? of the
"business" was good and wholesome
and the cast was in splendid hands.
Eddie Redway and Nellie Lynch are
not stranger# hqre and they last night
added greatly to their popularity. Hel
en McLeod repeated the success which
she scored on the occasion of her for
mer appe<aTance here, and Gus Pixley
divided honors with the principals.
Will HaU'er's voice is wonderfully
good. It was a disappointment to the
large audience that some of the! pro
gram was cut; bU| what there was
j was delightful. There is some pros
[pect that t'he company may be brought
back to open the new theater. It will
be Welcomed. The chorus is especially
good. Such beautiful dances have not
been since the old timef "ballet" dis
appeared and the "show girl" began
to glide majestically through pant'o-.
mimic scenes of motion. Mr. Mitchell
keeps his phlanx of girlish beauty so
busy changing elaborate) and becoming
costumes, and so much busier dan
cing, singing, poosing, and expressing
splendidly the meaning of genuine
"spectacle" that the blight of the alc
karaisical, "posing" show-girl is quite
lifted off t*heir loveliness.
Moreover, it is Herbert's exquisite
music that makes it a revel of irresist-

"The Alaskan."
Lora Lieb, prima donna soprano of
John Cort's comic opera. "The Alas
kan," somewhat set the fashion of
stage apparel and has given the
Merry Widow hats a fine run for their
laurels. In the first act of "The Alas
kan" Miss Lie;b makes her appearance
dressed in a magnificent' costume,
beautifylly crowned by a hat of artis
tic dimensions that would make the
Paris, London and New York connois
seurs "back up an alley" and "go
east" with mortification.
Miss Lieb's hats are consanguineous
with the provefrbial cart wheels of the
Pioneers of fhe "golden" days of Cali
fornia, but are, at the same time, orig
inal in the extreme. Her confrere in
designing these novel conceptions of
"top-piecc" artistieality was a dis
ciple of a celebrated milliner of Paris
who became unpopular and was "fired"
because of her propinquity for know
ing too many of the secrets of the se
crets of the milinery business.
