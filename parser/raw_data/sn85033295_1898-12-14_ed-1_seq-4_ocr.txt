fit. Three years ago my condition was
alarming; the least noise would startle and

number of sinking spells and slowly grew
worse. I began using Dr. Miles’ Restorative
Nervine and Nerve and Liver Pills. At first
the medicine seemed to have no effect, but
after taking a few bottles 1 began to notice
a change: I rested better at night, my appe

better, until now I am as nearly restored
to health as one of my age may expect. God
bless Dr.Miles’Nervlne.”

It cost Herman B. Dable $l,-
648.07 to be elected to congress
from this district, according to the
statement of expenses he has filed
with the secretary of state. Of this
amount $450 went to John M. Nel
son as chairman of the Republican
Congressional committee.
The forty-sixth annual meeting of
the Wisconsin Teachers’ association
will be held in Milwaukee, December
27—29. The program is completed
and will soon bedistrinule 1. An effort,
has been made to provide a program
interesting and helpful to all. Teach
ers should lend the support of their
presence to the work the association
is doing to build up the teaching pro
fession and improve t he schools in the
state.
The Republican stare officers-elect
and the defeated Democratic candi
dates have certified to the following
expenditures for campaign purposes:

J. T. Ellarson, state fish and
game warden, says that some minor
changes will probably be made in the
present laws for the protection of
fish and game at the session of the
legislature this winter. The present
laws are working well in most cases,
and the changes will not be radical.
Mr. Ellarson is of the opinion that
soi ing shooting of game will be pro
hibited and there will be changes
made regarding fishing in the outly
ing waters of the state. The changes
will be made in order to make our
game laws correspond with those of
adjoining states. —Madison Journal.
Th 3 great majority of Wisconsin
Republicans would be displeased to
have* Attorney-General-elect Hicks
surrender the three positions in his
department to so-called LaFollette
workers, even though he feels under
obligations to this faction for his
nomination. And we do not believe
that so sagacious a man as Mr. Hicks
intends to take such foolish action
as to choose as his first assistant a
person who is not acceptable to
Governor Scofield. Certainly neither
Mr. Roe nor Mr. Long would fill the
bill in this way, able lawyers though
they may be. On the other hand,
the appointment of 0. E. Buell, of
Madison, would, we think,give gener
al satisfaction. He is reputed to be
an attorney of merit, and from what
little we know of him, we feel that he
is a gentleman of even temperament
and pleasing manners. He presided
at the Republican congressional con
vention held here last September and
made an excellent impression upon
all who followed the convention’s
proceedings.
Washington Letter
-1 From our Regular Correspondent.!
Washington, December 9, 1898.
President McKinley, by the wise
omissions from his annual message
to congress, has greviously disap
pointed the Democrats. That is
why the whole menagerie is snarling.
They thought,or had persuaded them
selves that they thought, the presi
dent would announce a hide-bound
policy towards the Philippines in ad
vance of the actual possession of
those islands by the United States,
but the president isn’t that sort of a
statesman. He doesn’t make up his
mind upon any subject blind folded,
least of all upon such an important
one as the future of 8,000,000 help
less people. He has delivered them
from the evils of Spanish rule, and
will give them a military government
that will be far better than any gov
ernment they haveever known. Tnat
is far enough to go for some time to
come. He will know more about the
subject before recommending the next
step. There are other omissions
from the message that are equally
wise, and they are equally as nag
ging to the Democrats, who have no
other hope for future success than
the mistakes they expect the Repub
licans to make. President McKinley
possesses the faculty of knowing
what not to say as well as what to
say. That is one reason his adminis
tration has been such a success.
Fighting over empty honors is an
old Democratic specialty. So the
wrangling between Bailey and anti-
Bailey Democrats as to who shall
lead the Democrats in the next house
is no innovation. Bailey leads some
of the Democrats in the present
house, and claims the right by
reason of his having received the
Democratic caucus nomination for
speaker, to lead them all. Notwith
standing the trouble it has brought
him, Bailey wants to hold the same
job in the next house; hence the
present wrangling.
Senator Vest has offered a resolu
tion declaring that this government
has no constitutional right to
acquire or govern colonies, and given
notice of his intention to make a
speech on the resolution. The reso
lution is clearly intended as a “feeler’
of the public as well as the senate;
ascertain how a partisan Demo
cratic tight on expansion would be
received. Some Democratic senators
will follow Vest, hut Senator Morgan
who is one of them, said of the Vest
resolution; “The resolution is a
little late. The constitutionality of
acquiring territory was settled when
we took Alaska. The annexation ot
Hawaii is another fact- accomplished,
r*o that no question for considera
tion remains. For one, I do not
propose t see the Republicans get
all the glory of the results of the war.
It was not a partisan war to begin
with, and the American flag haying
been planted in the Philippines,. 1
want to lea participator in the
glory which attaches to its presence
there.”
That congress will provide for a
revival of the grades of admiral and
vice-admiral in the navy seems
reasonably certain. It has been rec
ommended b3 r the president and the
secretary of the navy; Senator Hale
has offered a resolution providing for
this revival, and Senator Morrill has
presented the resolution adopted by
the Vermont legislature, asking that
the grade of admiral be revived, and
that Rear Admiral Dewey be pro
moted thereto. There is no such op
position in congress to the revival of
these naval grades as there is to the
recommendation of General Miles
that in the reorganization of the
army one general and two lieutenant
generals should be provided for.
Similar recommendations have been
made in the past by Generals Sher
man and Schofield, but opposition in
congress has always prevented ac
tion.
Speaker Reed had a very pleasant
conference this week with President
McKinley and arranged for another
to take place as soon as the speaker
has conferred with his Republican
colleagues on the house committee
on rules and the other Republican
leaders in the house, and they have
agreed upon the legislative pro
gramme to be followed at this ses
sion. As soon as that programme
has been determined upon the
speaker will submit it to the presi
dent for approval and amendment.
The same harmony that existed at
the last session between the execu
tive and legislative branches of the
government is to be continued, so
far as it is in the power of the Re
publicans in the house tocontinueit.
The senate, on account of its present
make-up —no party with a majority—
is necessarily an uncertain quantity
in the legislative programme.
The only material difference
between the government of Hawaii
and New Mexico, Arizona, or Okla
homa, after the bill carrying out the
recommendations of the Hawaiian
commission has become a law, as it
is sure to in due time, will be that
in the former territory there will be
a property and an educational quali
fication for suffrage.
The hills which have been intro
duced to both house and senate for
the reorganization of the army do
not follow the recommendations of
General Miles, because it is not be
lieved that a bill carrying as many
high officers as he recommends could
get through congress. The bills in
troduced provide for a lieutenant
general, six major-generals and
twelve brigadier-generals.
The Milwaukee wheat market yes
terday was moderately active and
%c higher, closing at 65%c for No. 1
and for No. 2 Northern. Flour
was unchanged. Bailey closed at 48c,
rye at 53%c, corn at 32c, and oats at
28%c. Hogs were slightly higher,
ranging at $3.30@53.45 for packing

OVER A MILLION A DAY.
The Numerous Demands That Are
Made on Helen Gould’s Parse
Through the Mails.
Ever since she was made mistress of
a vast fortune Miss Helen Gould has,
like all other wealthy women, been the:
daily recipient of large numbers of
begging letters. Her mail was in
creased enormously by the newspaper
announcement that she had offered
the government a large sum to aid in
prosecuting the war against Spain. In
one day recently she received 607 let
ters, most of them of the begging va
riety, the total sum asked by her cor
respondents being considerably more
than $1,000,000. The amounts ranged
all the way from $3.60 for seven tickets
to a church fair to $400,000, which a
cranky genius demanded so that he
might be able to build a warship on
plans which he had perfected. Five
other inventors offered their patents
for a total of $301,000 and 60 letter
writers asked for loans aggregating
$116,796. A Klondike claim was offered
for $50,000 and an estate on the Hud
son for $40,000.
The day this wagon load of mail
was brought to Lyndhurst, her coun
try home at Irvington, Miss Go aid was
deep in the work of providing relief
for sick and wounded soldiers. A vis
itor to Lyndhurst at that time says
that the interior of the place speaks
more eloquently ..ban words of the in
tense interest which its mistress takes
in the war relief works. The library
was no longer a library. It was, to use
the words of Miss Gould’s companion,
a “sweat shop.’’ The chairs and floors
were strewn with pajamas, the tables
with pads and pencils, boxes of neces
saries for tilling comfort bags, and
heaped up piles of filled comfort bags
were on chairs and in corners. Book
cases lined the walls, it is true, and
books were scattered in orderly pro
fusion on the tables, but they were
all that in any way indicated the orig
inal design of the apartment in which
we stood. Two sewing machines oc
cupied the place of honor. One was
even in the drawing-room—rather an
incongruous ornament to the hand
some apartment. Everything bespoke
the absolute relinquishment of any
thing which was in any way foreign
to the business on hand, that of car
ing for the soldiers. Tne brave men
w T ho had gone to the front had found
a warm spot in the heart of the mis
tress and everything she had was at
their disposal. Even the maids had
been called into service and they w r ere
all busy stitching pajamas and com
fort bags and making button holes,
sewing on buttons and tapes. Every
spare moment of their time, when not
engaged in household duties, which
my informant bewailed, were sadly
neglected and devoted to the sol
diers. —Chicago Chronicle.
