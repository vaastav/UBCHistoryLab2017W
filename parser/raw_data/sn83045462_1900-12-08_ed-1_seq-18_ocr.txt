As they .ntered the big room, trembling,
the ot her day they were, probably, the
n-,st dimInutive spectin ns of colored ur
chins that had ever appeared before the
angst body known as the grand jury. Mr.
Ilarvey Given, looking back through an ex
perience of many years. had no recollection
on any former occasion of the appearance
of witnesses so young. In his capacity as
an assistant clerk of the Supreme Court of
the District of Columina. Mr. Given is
charged with the duty of administering the
oath to those summoned to testify before
the grand jury.
A reasonable doubt existed in the mind of
Mr. Giveii regarding the competency of the
little f-lows to be sworn as witnesses. He
was not quite sure that they clearly under
st,od and appreciated the nature of a legal
o- th. Therefore Mr. Given assumed the
rle if cross-examiner.
"Do you boys go to Sunday school?" in
quired the clerk.
"Yes, sir," was the prompt reply, in
chorus.
"Do you know there is a heaven?"
"Yes, sir."
"And a bad place?" persisted the clerk.
"Yes. sir."
"That is most all fire?"
"Yes, sir."
"Do you know what it is to tell a lie?"
"Oh. yes. sir."
"Then," said Mr. Given, greatly encour
aged. "of course you know where you
would go it you should tell a lie now?"
"Indeed we do." de, lared the lads. "We'd
be sent to the reform school."
The grand jurors smiled as Mr. Given ad
ministered the oath.
-It Is the belief of well-informed mission
aries in China," said a newspaper corre
spondent. "that Kuang Hsu, the Chinese
emperor. is a Christian, and that he be
came converted to the Christian religion
during ti reform period in 1K98. I recent
ly saw the agent at Pekin of the American
Bible Society. He holds to the same opin
lon as th' others. and furnishes ground for
his bliefs. He says that in 1898 the Bible
Society received a request from the em
peror for II) books. The list was sent in
the enlwror's name. How he had gotten
a list of that many was not known, as the
Bible S-,civty did not have over eighty
nine in its Imssession. They sent that num
ber to the emperor and received his thanks.
On failing t. get all the books he had
asked for, the emperor .sent some of his
et'nuchs ar,,und to the headquarters of the
different missionary societies for copies of
works th. liible Society did not have.
Nearly a!l of the books asked for were of
a religious nature One was a life of
Christ. The emperor also requested a
story of Peter the Great of Russia. the
story of Japan's great rise in the world and
the work on the reconstruction of France
after the war with Germany. The requests
were cnsidered significant. Peter the
Great. it will be remembered, made a mag
niticent nation out of rude material.
France rapidly recuperated from the ef
fevts of the German war, and Japan has
made the most marvelous progress in mod
ern times. It Is regarded as certain that
the Chinese emperor is coming to a reali
zation of what he could do and that he
is trying to see light. If he ever gets free
from the surroundings which make him a
figurehead he may make a mark in the
world."
There was a remarkable mix-up in the
corridor of the State, War and Navy De
partment.s last week that involved a mes
senger, an electric bell and an assistant
Fecretary. The assistant secretary in ques
tion is an exceedingly able official, but very
deaf and somewhat irascib:e. The mes
senger is a model of devotion to his chief
and thoroughly inured to his ways, while
the electric bell is just a plain electric
bell and nothing more. To understand
the situation thoroughly one must under
etand that the ordinary solid doors to the
Secretary's offices are reinforced on the
outside by Venetian slat doors which may
be locked from the inside, denying access
to the room although the inner door is still
open.
On the morning in question the electric
bell started with a few short, sharp rat
t:es to call the messenger. Then the stac
Cato~ rings grew it a long roll as though
a drummer were endeavoring to beat up a
whole army from its midnight slumber.
Finally the bell got tired and took a rest.
Then it started again and rang as though
the wires had got crossed and never in
tended to untangle themselves. Meanwhile
the messenger, ordinarily attentive to his
official duties, sat quietly outside of the
door with one foot on the table and his
napkin spread out on his lap, eating his
lunch. One might have imagined that he
had caught his chief's oral affliction, but
this was not the case. Several diplomats
passing down the corridor toward Secre
tary' Hay's office took in the scene with
wondering glances, smiled and passed on,
Half a dozen messengers and as many
newspaper men, attracted by the racket,
stopped to inquire what was the matter
and why the ordinarily attentIve messen
ger d!di not answer the bell. He explinedi
between mouthfuls of sandwich that some
time previously his chief in a fit of temper
at being interrupted on some important
work had dashed out from his desk. locked
the slat door on the inside and going back
to his diesk had promptly forgotten about
the oc'urrence and was at that moment
using untold volts (of good government
electricity in trying to call his messenger.
NEAR
"Have you noticed that there are day
world-more in unison with nature?"
"Yes: it I. alwnys that way with me o
d9 rd
The door was locked, the messenger was
on the outside and the under secretary
was too deaf to hear any knocking or rat
tling of the knob of the door. This com
edy of errors continued for about fifteen
minutes. when the messenger was struck
by a brilliant idea. He doubled up a large
blue sheet of blotting paper, stuck it
through the slats of the door and wig
wagged violently to his impatient chief
on the inside. The inder secretary caught
the signal of distress, there was a creak
and a rattle as a swing chair shot half
across the room and the sound of "lan
guage" on the inside as the Irate official
rushed across the room to unlock the door.
What happened to the messenger when
he got inside no one waited to see.
There is little wonder that the aspiring
young newspaper man, whose first assign
ment carried him to the geological survey,
felt like seeking some other profession after
he had run against a genuine scientific
treatise on matters geologic. Perhaps
many an older man in the service would
have been staggered to learn that "until
the presence of the Algonkian rocks was
determined the writer entertained the work
ing hypothesis that a large laccolith of
porphyry might have been intruded at a
horizon near the base of the Paleozoic for
mations, but the appearance of the pre
Paleozoic rocks in the heart of the moun
tains, with no evidence of the hypothecated
laccolith, renders it improbable that the
uplift can be primarily connected with por
phyry intrusion." However, it was gratify
ing to know that "all the sheet rocks and
many (likes are included petrographically
under a sing:e name, monzonite-porphyry,
expressing the composition. in which the
alkall feldspar, orthoclase and the soda
lime feldspar. plagioclase, are estimated to
play approximately equal roles. The fur
ther composition of the rock is expressed
by saying that it is a quartz-bearing horn
blendic monzonite-porphyry."
Many a man would perhaps sleep sounder
at night if he were only aware that "the
hornblendic monzonite-porphyry intrusions
and the monzonite stock are by far the
most important of the igneous masses in
the Rico mountains. The rock is in compo
sition a monzonite-porphyry in which or
thoclase assumes a prominent position in
large phenocrysts, while plagioclase occurs
in part in the groundmass. The rock is
more closely related to the stock monzonite
in composition than to the earlier horn
blendic monzonite-porphyry."
Imagine the thrill that ran down his
spine when he learned that "contact meta
morphism of the calcareous strata adja
cent to the monzonite stock is very pro-,
nouinced at nearly all places where the
former rocks are exposed in the vicinity of
the intrusive."
But after all he derived the most satis
faction from learning, much to his sur
prise, that "if the quiescent neve was ever
permanently frozen in the nivated areas,
many of the 'bergschrunds' must have
been situated well above the spheroid of
perpetual frost."

The newly opened Washington headquar
ters of the national republican committee
are in the second story of the old Metropol
itan Club building at H street and Vermont
avenue. On the same floor are the rooms
of the Christian Scientists, and as a visitor
ascends from the lower floor he sees on the
wall at the turn of the stairs a sign which
reads "Christian Science Reading Room"
;nd bears a hand pointing directly to
the national committee's room. This condi
tim has led to many amusing incidents.
While a Star reporter and several others
were waiting for Secretary Heath yester
day an old rustic-looking gentleman saun
tered in. calmly took a seat, picked up a
copy of the Syracuse, Kansas, News that
happened to be lying on a table and pro
ceeded to peruse it. For nearly half an
hour he sat reading and never said a word,
his only movements being to push his hat
further back on his grizzled head and stroke
his straggly beard a couple of t us. Fin
aliy look"n up he addressed . Albert
Brown, who was diligeritly pouni g away
at a typewriter, and remarked:
"I ben told I cud git sum tracks tellin'
'bout Christian Science beer, but I don't
see nuthin' like thet erount heer.'
Mr. Brown informed him that hp was in
the wrong place and directed him down the
hall where the "tracks" were to be ob
tained.
"What mought this office be? inquired
the old man.
"it is the headquarters of the-national
republican committee," interjected The Star
reporter, who was thus addressed.
"Bedog ef they's much Christian Science
'bout thet," he ejaculated and out he went.
"It may appear strange to you," said a
diamond expert to a Star reporter yester
day. "but damp, murky weather practical
ly kills the diamond business. No dealer
daure buy for fear of cheating himself, The
purest white diamond will on one of these
dark, foggy days take on a straw color,
and to all appearances is off color. Al
ways pick out a diamond on a clear day,
hut see to It that you have a good light on
the gem, for many dealers tint their ceil
ings and wails a delicate hue, 'which gives
the stone a bluish tint which it does not ur
should tnt possess in a clear light.'"
One of the improvements introduced
about the Senate chamber by Sergeant-at
Arms Ransdell is an arrangement of three
red incandescent lights, which are placed
over the south door of the Senate so that
they can be seen from the maini door of the
House of Representatives, on the other side
of the ('apitol. This is done to save mem
bers a trip across the big building when
the Senate is in executive session and closed
to the outside world, which fact is always
signaled by the burning of the red lights.
These signals are known to every member
of the House, but the tendency of men to
have eyes and see not is shown every day
the Senate goes in executive session by the
arrival of a large number of members un
der the very signals that have shone in
their eyes during their entire walk across
the building. They know the lights are
there, hut they attempt to enter the Senate
chamber before they become aware of the
secret nature of t-he proceedings, and have
to retrace their steps.

GOT WHAT HE DESERVED
In one of the upper corners of the down
town 9th stre2t car the lively little foir
year-old boy was giving his weary-looking
mother about all she could attend to. First
he would want to stand on the seat and
hammer on the window until It seemed as
it the glass would just have to smash. Then
he would stand on his mother's lap with his
muddy little shoes, and twist her veil up
Into knots, and push her nose the wrong
way. and make a fork of his fore and mid
dle fingers and-jab them into her eyes, and
pull down her back hair, and tug at her
collar, and loosen her breastpin, and pull
down her lower lip to make it."snap," and
yank at her ears, and divert himself in
other little comfortable ways of the sort.
Then he would demand to be set down on the
floor, in the aisle, where he would pound with
all his might on his mother's knees and
sing at the top of his lungs, until she would
stop him with a warning "Sh-sh, Willie!"
Whereupon he would seize his mother's um
brella and attempt to open it in her face,
and bawl lustily when she attempted to
take it away from him. When she endeav
ored to effect a cessation of his bawling
he would kick her on the shins.
The other passengers glared at the angel
child and secretly hankered to own him for
about forty-two seconds. in order to "put
him next" to a few little things which he
seemed not to understand. The pale, tall
man, however, who was sitting right along
side the angel child's seat, seemed to be
paying no attention whatever to the young
one's deviltries. He looked straight ahead
of him out of the window, nor did all of the
wrigglings or noise of the youngster cause
him to remove his gaze from a point
straight ahead. It might have been
thought, to louk at him, that he was suffer
ing from stiff neck, and that it was there
fore impossible for him to turn his head
either one way or the other.
The angel four-year-old continued to en
joy himself as the car reached the down
town section. He began to make comments
upon the personal appearance of entering
passengers-loudly calling attention to the
"big nose" of this one, to the "big mouth"
of that one, and the "funny-lookin' face"
of the other one. His mother said "Sh-sh!"
a great many times, but the kid apparently
didn't hear her, or didn't want to hear her.
The passengers went right on longing to
have the celestial Infant in a woodshed for
varying periods of time, but the pale, tall
man right alongside the young one kept
right on looking straight ahead.
The personal characteristics of the pas
sengers palled upon the youngster after a
time, and he looked around for other ways
of amusing himself. Finally, he climbed up
on the seat again, and slyly reaching
around back of the pale, tall man's head,
he clutched one end of the latter's mus
tache and gave It a good, hard tug. The
pale, tall man didn't even wince. He didn't
remove his gaze from the point directly
ahead of him. But he carefully and delib
erately gathered the young one in his arms,
placed the young one across his knee, and,
still looking out of the window, and appar
ently totally uninterested in what he was
doing, he let the young one have a round
dozen on the spot where they would do the
most good with an amount of resounding
force that caused the young one to howl
like fun.
"That's just what the kid needed in his
business," thought all of the other passen
gers, "and I'd like to have been the one to
hand him what was coming to him-but,
cracky! won't his mother more than lay
that fellow out. though!"
They looked at the mother, waiting for
the explosion. However, she seemed to
take It all as a matter of course. She- didn't
utter a word of objection. When the pale,
tall man was through spanking the young
one, and had deposited him in his mother's
lap, the other passengers couldn't under
stand why she didn't open up on the spank
er and tell him many things after theiash
Ion of mothers In such cases made and
provided. The kid was howling.
"You got just what you deserved from
papa!" was the way the mother comforted
the yelling one, and then, at L street, the
pale, tall man signaled the conductor, Vrl,
stePping off, assisted his wife and reca,ci
trant son and heir to alight, while the other
passengers looked sheepishly at each other,
after the tnann(,r of folks who feel that,
somehw or another, they haven't got their
rnoley'a worth.
ALL THE RAGE.
Buttons and Badges More Generally
Worn Than Ever Before.
"There never was a time when. lapel
buttons of orders, associations, clubs, col
leges, classes, corps, societies and frater
nal organizations were so popular as now,"
said a dealer in these articles of individual
distinction to a Star reporter.
"It was only a few years ago that the
lapel button was confined pretty much to
the members of the G. A. R., the members
of the fraternal societies wearing pins.
Now about every other man you meet
wears a button of some sort, and though
the election is over a month, the McKinley
button Is frequently seen. In fact, in the
past campaign the trade sold more buttons
than ever before and they went all over
the country.
"What- particular reason may be ad
vanced why men wear these outward em
blems of membership of a certain order?
WVeli, there are two principal reasons-to
give notice to their fellow members who
are strangers and also to Inform the pub
lic. Again, man' is not yet entirely re
mo,ved from the traits of his former state
of barbarianism, and personal adornment
with bright ornaments Is one of the char
acte'ristics of savagery. The underlying
principle of human vanity which causes
the Alaskan belle to pierce her thick lips
with a sharp piece of fish bone is the same
as impels her more civilized sister else
where to pierce her ears for rings. A man
with a button in the lapel of his coat no
doubt feels that he is just one degree at
least better than the man who hasn't one,
esplweially if he Is a member of one of the
more exclusive fraternal or other organi
zations. If he didn't he wouldn't wear It.
"in France the wearing of .the trn-color
of the Legion of Honor means something
to the wearer aside from the great personal
distinction which attaches to the man who
can display the little knot of ribbon on his
coat, as he is exemp)t from arrest save for
the more serious crimes and otherwise pos
sesses privileges in public which the pub
lic there fully respects. In this country
there is a comradeship among the wearers
of the same button, and its outward exhi
bition is usually sufficient for an informal
introduction right on the spot between two
or more total strangers, which is a good
thing among men who travel. Anything
which will make closer the bond of human
sympathy in this cold, practical world Is
to he encouraged.
"Within the past few years, and espe
cially this year, the vogue for wearing pins
indicative of the colors of the different col
leges has greatly increased, particularly
among the fair sex, who thus shoyW their
fealty to the institution which their big
brother or sweetheart attends. Our trade
takes a spurt at the beginning of the foot
ball season.
"Members of athletic and yachting clubs
are fond of their respective emblems, and
they are to be seen in the lapels of all
members of the different military organi
zations. The young people of the Chris
tian Endeavor Society take pride in the
p)lain gold initials C. E. Interwoven, and I
doubt if any member of the'Gridiron Club,
Washington's club of journalists, would
part with his little golden gridiron for a
well-stocked jewelry store."
Identifying the Class.
From the (iilcago Evening Post.
"I don't recall seeing you at college, I
guess you must be before my time."
"Possibly, possibly. Who was at the
head of the faculty when you were there?"
"UJm-let me see-I don't just recall his
name, but I was there the year Jinks
played half back on the foot bali team and
kicked a goal twice from the field In the
last half of-"
"Oh, sure, of course. That was the year
our center rush carried most of the op
posing team on his back for a gain of
thirty yards. Yes, indeed. I wonder who
was president then. I don't seem to be able
to remember minor details of college life
myself."
Unkind Insinuation.
From the Pittsburg Chironiele-Telegraph.
"Mr. Homewood proposed to me last
night," sad Miss Northside to her dearest
girl friend, Miss Manchester.
"He lost an election bet, I suppose," wras

AND THE4 HE WOKE UP
On Saturfa droon last th Emer"
gency deport* rwsily drew his chair
close to one of the gilded steam radiators
and Idly began to draw geometrical figures
on the same W)We he Agured on how much
of a hole It M id make in his wages to
send Her a 6lrthday gift consisting of a
double AmerlOW13eadty rose for each year
of Her life. Thus he was engaged when
one of his friends, a well-known official of
the governmep1pinting qifice, crept up be
hind him andl t%ched him lightly on the
shoulder. .
"Sh-sh!" hissed the official, holding up a
warning fing,7. ''Are we aloner'
"Sure," replied the Emergency Reporter.
"The bunch ave,,,knocaed off for the day.
I'm only hakgdig'around in case anything
big enough happens to warrant an extra."
"No danger oi anybody running in on us
here?" said the well-known official of the
government printing office, with an air of
anxiety.
"Nobody but the sweep-up woman's liable
to cut In," answered the Etriergency Re
porter, looking the well-Known oicial over
and noung his somewhat excited appear
ance. "day, what's doing? You Ioa as If
you had the goods on you."
The well-known omc,ai took a chair with
an air of relief and smiled benignly upon
the Emergency Reporter.
"Oh, nothing," he said, airily, "except
that I've at length found the chance to
give you that little push along I promised
you some time ago, and that you'll just
about be able to spend the winter on the
Nile or the Riviera or take a protracted
cruise on the Mediterranean; that's all."
The Emergency Reporter sat up stiff in
his chair ,and gazed at the well-known offi
clal of the government printing office.
"Great Scott, man!" he ejaculat-ed.
"Come at' me easier! What you got? Oh,
but," and there was a shade of disappoint
ment in his tone, "some of you people
think you've got big stuff when it's really
not worth more than half a stick or so."
The well-known - official tucked his
thumbs in the armholes of his waistcoat,
chewed on his unlighted cigar and regard
ed the Emergency Reporter blandly.
"That so?" he Inquired. "Oh, I don't
know. Now, I suppose you'll be willing to
admit that the message of the President
of the United States to the Congress Is
worth more than.'half a stick or so,' eh?"
The Emergency Reporter leaped right In
to the air. When he descended he ran to
the door and locked it. Then he turned
to the well-known official with a pale coun
tenance.
"The message, man?" he gasped, In a
choked tone. "Why, that's not to be re
leased Until next Monday, and this Is only
Saturday."
"So I had understood," said the well
known official of the government printing
office, striking a match and lighting his
cigar. "I believe there is a popular im
pression abroad to that general effect."
The well-known official blew smoke rings
at the ceiling and smiled dreamily. The
Emergency Reporter clapped him on the
shoulder.
"D'ye mean to say that you're going
to-that you're going to-"
"Pre-cise-ly, my boy," said the well
known official of the governmental printing
plant. "Ex-act-ly. 'Member my telling you
long ago. when you-did me that little favor,
that I'd rid myself of the obligation some
old day? Well, 'I'm a man of my word.
You get the message exclusively, for
any use that ydu may elect to put it to,
and you get it tonight. Now, in fact, son,
I don't want ak Jiart of the rake-off, un
derstand. Just want to give you a little
shove along,.that's'all."
The Emergecy *eporter wrung the well
known officialis ha%d in the excess of his
emotion.
"Old man," he sild, hoarsely, "I'll never
forget you fV this, honest injun, cross my
heart, I won't. Aid. ,ay, you'll at least
let me send Your little girl an automobile
out of the profits of the yank-down, won't
you? Let mai repay you to that extent, at
least." 4
"Oh, well, if youlinsist upon it," replied
the well-knoltn official, amiably, picking
up the alligator satchel that he had brought
into the room with him and opening it.
"By the way;, I only had a c4hance to run
off fifteen cAAplete' copies of the message
without takiik too many chances. They'll
be enough forl you?"
"Fifteen!" etelinied the Emergency Re
porter. "Why, - man, you're just a bird,
that's what you ar&-a fan-talled. pink
billed, greena(dtibed, 1 triple-X bkrd! Fif
teenS Why, say, thL1 amount :f business
that I'll do with ffkbsd fifteen'll-2'
"Well, I'm mighty glad they'll be enough,"
put in the weI44nowa official, pulling one
of the rubber-banded, packages of proof
out of the satchel. "There's one of the
copies, son, finally correCted and proof read,
just as It'll be handed out officially -on Mon
day next. There's about 25,Q(* words of it,
I judge."
The Emergency Reporter grasped the
copy.: hastily unfolded It, glanced up and
down the sl!ps and gazed ecstatically at
the well-known official.
"Dog-gone my hide!" he ejaculated. "I'll
send your little girl half a dozen automo
biles, whether you sta'"d for it or not! Just
you see If I don't."
"Don't mention, It, my boy," replied the
well-known official, with a pleased expres
fdon. "I'll just be toddling along now. i
know that you'll have to get a hustle on in
order to make arrangements for the use
of those fifteen copies of the message," and
with a parting shake of the hand he rapidly
disappeared out of -the door,
The 10mergency Reporter dug 'his hands
into the contents of. the satchell containing
the fifteen oophes of the President's .mes
sage as If they were smuggled Ko'h-i-noors.
"Oh, I can just see myself doing any
more work after tonIght, can't I?" he mut
tered, and then he put on his overcoat,
distribute~d the ftfteen copies of the mes
sage throughout the various pockets tihere
of and went to the telegraph office. kie
hastily dashed off telegrams to the leading
newspapers of fifteen of the largest cities
of the country, inform4ng the editors there
of that he had captured copies of the mes
sage, and offering It to each of them ex
clusively for $1,000 In cash. The clerk wino
took the telegrams at the window gazed
admiringly at the Emergency Reporter as
he handed them in.
"That's just like finding $15,000, ain't it?"
said the clerk to the Emnergency Reporter,
who smiled in a superior way and repliled,
"Well, I ju-st guess yes!"
Then, to quiet his nerves, the Emergency
Reporter went out and absorbed a high sar
saparilla while he waited for the replies of
the editors to come in, He played a game
of pin pool and then he went back to the
telegraph office. A response to every one
of the fifteen telegrams was in, and every
one of them announced the editor's ac
ceptance of the Emergency Reporter's
terms and urged him to get the message
on the wire at the earliest possible mo
ment. The Emergency Reporter pulled out
his fifteen copies of the message, marked
them with the names of the leading papers
to whioh they were to be sent, went out
and bought him three perfectos for 50O
cents and insisted on every man he knew
that passed joining him in a bottle of pop.
The bartender opened one of these bottles
of pop with a loud report-and the Emer
gency Reporter woke up.
"Tired again, eh?" the raucous voice of
the city editor was saying In his ear. "Say,
the Sons and Daughters of-Mesopotamia are
going to have thei' semi-annual installa
tion ceremonies tonight, and I hear there's
liable to be a scrasp on over a meditated
change in the by-laws, You know where
the Sons and 'Daughters of" Mesopotamla
meet, don't you, Pete? Down on the Island
somewhere or'knot1l%r, I believe It is. Just
run down there tonight and get the names
of the newly 'elected Sons and Daughters.
Oh, 'bout halt a stick ought to cover it.
That'll be abdiitt all"for you, I th-ink."'
Then the Egnergency Reporter went out
into the raw, - netteating air and drearily
mused upon te ndIfhber of double Ameri

WHEN BEGGAR LADY WON
A young Baltimorean and his wift cele
brated the second anniversay sf their 5
rnage by coming over to Wadhington on
Meaday morning last to sea CongreS as
semble, and they remained over a day for
the rpurpose of having a look at the Ben
ning racing. Despite Tuesday's vicious
weather, they went out to the track. It
was the first time the young man had
"seen 'em run" since his marriage, al
though before that solemn event he had
been an often-bitten victim of the "horse
bug." Like all men who have sworn off on
fooling with the thoroughbreds, however,
he had kept a pretty fair "line" on the
runners by assiduously reading the results
from all of the tracks, so that when he
went to the track on Tuesday he thought
that he had a fair chance of breaking about
even with the layers of odds. His wife had
never seen a horse race In her life before,
and when the horses clomped around
through the mud in the first race she ex
hibited considerable excitement, despite the
cheerless surroundings caused by the
weather conditions. Her husband, how
ever, didn't look particularly inspirited
when the nuthber of the winner was hung
up. His face wore a sheepish grin, in fact.
"Why," said his wife, noticing his cha
grined look, "didn't the horse that you bet
on win?"
"No," he replied. "He was beaten a head
on the wire."
"Well, it looked to me as If they both
passed by just at the same time," she said,
with rather an aggrieved air. "I don't
think it ought to make any difference if one
of them is just a teeny little bit ahead of
the other, do you?"
"Well," he explained, "there's got to be
a winner, you know, unless the race's a
dead heat, which this wasn't."
"I don't care one bit," she replied, "I
think that horse that the old things in the
judges' stand say came In second is just
as good as the one they say came in first."
"They wouldn't admit that, though. if
you were to tell them," said the husband.
"Funny I couldn't pick the winner in a
field of only four horses, Isn't it? Well,
I'll run down to the ring and see what the
betting is on the next."
She looked as if she had something to
say, and she said it before he got away.
"Jack," she &.id in, a wheedling tone,
"let me bet a teeny weeny little bit, too.
won't you? It makes it so much more ex
citing."
"Jack" looked at her with a grin.
"You bet, eh?" he said. "What d'ye su
pose your mother 'ud say to me if she
found out that I let you bet? And, say,
isn't It enough to have one hoodoo loser in
the family? Can't you have just as much
fun 'rooting' for the one I bet on?"
"Oh, but it would be so much nicer if I
could bet just a teenchy weenchy little bit
on one of the pretty things that I picked
out myself on the (program," she answered.
"Oh, that's all imagination, and you-"
"Please," she said, still more wheedlingly.
"Oh, well, then, beggar lady, go ahead."
he said, diripping off a $5 note from his
roll of bills, and then he rushed down the
stairs to the betting ring.
Her eyes sparkled as she looked over the
names of the horses for tne second race on
her program.
"Beggar Lady!" she exclaimed, half
aloud, as her eye caught the name of one
of the horses to run. "Why, that's what
Jack just this minute called me! Beggar
Lady!"
At that instant one of the grand stand
messengers-passed by, with his list of odds
against the horses in his hand. She
stopped him.
"Can Beggar Lady run real fast?" she
asked him demurely.
"I don't know, ma'am," answered the
messenger, smiling. "The filly's never run
before in a race. This is her first time
out.'
"Well, if she wins, how much do I get
for this?" she said, showing him the $5 bill.
The messenger grinned and glanced at his
list of prices.
"Beggar Lady's one o' the outsiders.
ma'am," he said. "She opened at 40 to 1.
I'll give you that. If she wins you get
back $W5."
The little woman paled a little.
"Goodness gracious-very well, then,'
handing him the $5 bill. "I will bet you ,)n
Beggar Lady, then."
The messenger jotted down the bet and
the young woman's initials, immediate,y
after which another grandstand messenger
rushed up to him and said something to
him in a low tone. The messenger, who
had registered the betting transaction with
the young woman, approached her again.
"Well, you just were in time, ma'am,"
ha said to her. "That Beggar Lady filly
has been hammered-"
"Hammered!" exclaimed the young wo
man. "Why, the brutes! Is the poor
thing-"
"Oh," hastily explained the messenger,
"I mean that they've been knocking her
price down In the ring, and now she's only
5 to 1, so that it looks like she may be
what's called a 'good thing.' "
"Well, I declare!" ejaculated the young
woman, and just as the messenger went
away her husband came up wearing an
easy smile of confidence.
"There's only one In this," he said to his
wife in a cock-sure tone, pointing to
Zenaide's name on the program, "and that's
the favorite. Zenaide'll win romping all
the way. I bet $20 on her-got $50 to $2M
against her."
"Can Zenalde run so much faster than all
the rest of the horses in the race, then.?"
she asked him with big eyes.
"Sure," he replied. "It's a cinch. A lot
of yaps down in the ring think they've got
a good thing in this Beggar Lady, and they
are more than eating it up. Played the
filly down from 50 to I to 5 to 1, and they're
still hammerIng at it. I've seen too many
of these good things go wrong in my day,
though. No more good things for me.
Friend of mIne out in the paddock told me
that Beggar Lady-she's never faced the
starter before, by the way-stood a rattling
show to land in the money, and advised me
to string a few along on her, one, two,
three, across the board-but not for mc!
Zenaide's the trick. By the way, what did
you do with your money? Play any of
'em ?"
"Yes, I bet," she replied. "I felt awfully
wIcked, but I bet, all the same."
"Which one?" he inquired.
"It'll be more fun telling you after the
race is all over," she replied, slyly.
Then the horses paraded in front of the
stand and went to the post. After a short
delay sway went the large field, the favor
ite. Zenaide, in front, it was a fair start
for all except Beggar Lady, who was
standing fiat-footed when the flag dropped.
A laugh went up in the stand.
"The 'good thing' can't find her feet,"
was the cry. "She's all but left."
Beggar Lady was last away, it was true,
but she quickly shot after her field, and at
the far turn, so great a flight of speed dId
she exhibit. she was right on even terms
with the leaders and still going like a sea
son.ed campaIgner. She led the field of
thirteen by a head In turning into the
stretCh.
"By jing!"~ muttered the young Balti
morean to his wife, "why didn't I have
gumption enough to put a few dollars on
that Beggar Lady? She's passed the whole
bunch and she's just galloping in, that's all
-just galloping!"
"Beggar Lady walks!"~ howled the crowdi
of long-shot players who had taken a bit of
the good thing. "Beggar Lady swims mn!"
The little lady from Baltimore turned her
pale face away from the sight of the horses
tearing down the stretch and sat down.
"And I had the tip strong!" growled her
husband, as Beggar Lady flashed by the
wire two lengths to the good. Then he
noticed his wife's pale face. "What's the
matter?" he asked her, anxiously. "Are
you faint?"
"Well," she replied, "a little bit, but it'll
pass. I suppose sudden great wealth always
affects people this way."
lie looked at her searchingly and amaz
edly.
"You don't mean to tell me that you put
those $5 on Beggar Lady?" he gasped,
"Well, what did you call me a 'beggar
lady' for when you gave me the bill?' she
asked hiim, regaining her color. "I've won
$200 just because of your habit of calling
names!"
"Oh. you can't beat 'em." the Baltimorean
said to a friend that night.
He wasn't referring to horses, but to
women.

Hooligan.xe ikely to-MaVTrouble
in London.
1lCE TO if-ABMIG CITIENS
Seem to Have Lost All Respect
for the Police.
ONLY NEED A LEADER
Special Correspondence of The Evening Star.
LONDON, December 1, 1900.
"Hooligan" is a word that has begun to
make London uneasy. It is a word that
may help to create history before long, if
the increase in what is now known as
Hooliganism continues in the present ratio.
The word did not come into general use
until lately, and it began to figure daily in
the newspapers only since the last outbreak
of patriotism over soldiers returning from
South Africa. One story of its origin is
that a police magistrate, trying a case of
unprovoked assault-one of uncommonly
many that had come before him in a short
time-said to the officer who had arrested
the prisoner: "What is this man?" mean
ing. doubtless, to ask the prisoner's nation
ality.
"He's of Hooley's gang, your worship."
said the officer.
"A Hooligan!" exclaimed the judge, mis
understanding. "Well, we have had enough
of the Hool.gan!"
And the name has been applied to prowl
ing street ruffians ever since.
The Hooligan is the germ of as lively a
riot as any modern city has seen. ie has
far more stamina than-his French confrere,
who has turned Paris upside down occasion
ally, and once he gets a-going it will not be
so easy to stop him. Heretofore his healthy
fear of the sturdy London policeman has
kept him In check. But that fear has been
diminished by a series of extraordinary
manifestations of human nature over epi
sodes of the war.
The cables reported at the time that staid
old London "had gone mad" and was "hold
ing carnival" over the relief of Ladysmith.
Disorderly Gangs.
What really happened was a quickly sub
siding outburst of genuine patriotism, fot
lowed-by a festival for the Hooligan. In
the general joy the bonds of propriety were
relaxed a little, and the Hooligan took ad
vantage of the opportunity to let himself
out correspondingly Without being frowned
upon by Bobby.
When Mafeking was relieved the vast
crowds that jammed the open space be
tween the Mansion House, the Royal Ex
' ge and the Bank of England were
posed early In the day of law-abiding
citizens, who -were permitted to celebrate
as much as they pleased. But between 5
and 0 o'clock the character of the crowd
changed ominously. Groups of muscular
young men with colored handkerchiefs in
place of collars, and caps in place of hats,
poured in from Whitechapel, Seven Dials
and Bethnal Green, and ventured a little
further in license than they had cared to
do on Ladysmith day. Their rather ugly
but generally good-natured capers were
what was generally described as a demon
stration of London patriotism, whereas it
was chiefly a demonstration of the Inge
nuity of riotous gangs in seeing how many
new liberties they could safely take with
the police.
From an English Viewpoint.
When the City Imperial Volunteers re
turned from the war a few weeks ago the
Hooligan gang went a step further than
they had ventured to go before. This let
ter to the editor of one of the conservative
papers soon afterward presents one view of
what happened:
"Is it not time that all true citizens, that
all true Christians and that all true Eng
lishmen set their faces steadfastly against
any more public demonstrations of the kind
that we have witnessed lately? However
patriotic and loyal we may feel and how
ever much we may desire to welcome
our gallant soldiers home in a fitting
manner, yet it is imperative that such
scenes as were witnessed on Mafeking day
and on Monday afternoon and evening last
be not repeated. On Monday it was almost
impossible for a lady or any respectable
woman to be In the crowd in certain parts
of the city without being openly insulted;
and later in the afternoon and evening such
awful sights and scenes took place that no
one but actual eye witnesses would believe
such things possible in this so-called
'Christian country.' The police, although
they did their best, were almost powerless
to cope with the immense crowds, and
'ruffianism' had a free hand. Drunkenness,
immorality and indecency of every kind;
theft. Hoolinganism and crime-these are
at present the chief results of a day de
voted to a 'welcome or demonstration.' "
Powerlessness of the Police.
It seems to an Impartial observer that
the writer of that letter drew it rather
strong, but there could be little doubt about
the fact that the dense crowds that took
possession of Pall Mali and the Strand
after the little parade was over, and had
everything their own way until 2 o'clock
the next morning, were largely tinctured
with a sinister element that was busily
taking note of the powerlessness of the po
lice.
In the daytime a force of 27.000 militia
and police had been wholly unable to keep
the crowds in check, and the home-coming
volunteers, instead -of marching proudly
down the streets, had had to struggle in
single file through a squirming, panting,
suffering mass of humanity. At night
every police officer in the carnival was tic
kled under the chin with a peacock feather
by at lea.st one person In every twenty that
passed him. He saw every girl who chose
to walk in the street hugged, kissed and
pulled about by every young man who
could get within reach of her. If her escort
objected, so much the worse for him. The
officer himself was considerably elbowed at
times, and got many a furtive poke in the
ribs and many a tap on the helmet. It was
great fun for everybody, but most of all
for the Hooligan, who was summing up the
result of his experiments with the police
in some such words as these: '"E ain't naw
thin' to be a-skeered of no more."'
If. when Lord Roberts returns to England
a few weeks hence, he is paraded in the
streets instead of being permitted to slip
in quietly as Gen. Buller did, we may have
a demonstration of the result of the Hooli
gan's deduction. A few more opportunities
of this sort, a little more incentive to mis
chief, a few daring- loafers and London
has all the material for a recurrence of the
scenes Dickens has depicted so vividly in
"Barnaby Budge.''
The Individual Hooligan.
The Hooligan, as he has now come to be
defined, is not simply a young ruffian. He
is not a professional bad man; he is not
even a loafer, and after he has reached the
age of twenty-two or twenty-three it not
infrequently happens that he joins the army
and becomes a first-rate soldier or settles
down irnto a moderately sober workman
who has lived so rapidly between fifteen
and twenty that he is middle-aged at twen
ty-five. His most distinctive feature is that
ha belongs to a gang with headquarters in
some beer dive. He earns money enough
to buy his share of the drinks, to pay his
share of the fines of members of the gang
who get arrested, and usually to have a
girl. He lives, after a fashion, with his
parents. He rarely smokes a pipe like his
more law-abiding brethren, but nearly al
ways has a cigarette in his mouth. His
costume fhas distinctive features, the muffler
and- cap already mentioned, a leather belt
in lieu of braces, and trousers tight at the
knee and broad at the ankle. He dearly
loves a good fight, and goes up a step in
the scale of his society when he has served
a turn in prison. He prowls about at night
in companies of four or five, looking for a
scrap with rival gangs, for women that he
can frighten or perhaps molest or for lonely
wa yfarers whom he can torment and per
haps rob. Such attacks have grown in
frequency of late, and have added to the
general alarm. -

which Whitechapel has been described as a
paradise and Drury Lane as a fashionable
resort. Here it was that Jack the Ripper
plied his bloodk trade.
"I know the so-called Hooligan." said
Mr. Davies to the writer. "although we do -
not breed him here. The lives led hy the
wretched children that you see swarming
in our streets result in a different type.

man they do it without ostentation.
"The Hooligan, on the other hand, is not
an idler. as everybody seems to suppose,
and he doesn't come from the bitter slum
districts. He is the boy or young fellow
who works in a factory. and wh, 'lts off

A Man at Fifteen.
"His being what he is is due to th., flaws
in the social condition of his kl'h and kin,
the absence of family life, the inliff-rence
of parents. I don't speak as a higoterl par
son, but I can say that. in working for re
ligious ends among such people. we "an get
the parents to take no interest in their chil
dren's welfare. I remember calling on a Ir
woman to speak to her about her son, a
boy fourteen years old, who I knew was
working.
" 'How much does your boy earn a week7'
I asked her.
"She said, 'I don't know, but he allows
me five shillings a week.'
"She didn't take enough interest in that
fourteen-year-old boy to ask how much he
earned, and that is one conditions that is
answerable for the Hooligan type. As soon
as these boys get out of the 'board schools' P
they go to work, and at fifteen or sixteen
every one of them is a man grown in mind
and viciousness; independent, devil-may
care; each one with his drink, his cigarette
and his own special girl.
"The Hooligan picks no quarrel with the
policeman, and he commits his Hooligan
isms when the officer is at the other end
of his beat. There's the remedy for the
evil-increase the police force by putting
in 'private clothes men.' As things are
now, the policeman's uniform makes him
helpless. He's the most prominent thing
in the block. One of them told me the
other day that for the last eight years com
plaint after complaint had been made of r
Hooliganism on a certain corner of his
beat, and he said, 'Do you know, sir, I
haven't seen it once.'
He Needs Spanking.
"In reply to a question as to whether he
did not look for ultimate trouble from Hooli
ganism, he replied that, unlike many oth
ers, he did not, pointing out that epidem
les of this sort of thing had occurred for
years, making special reference to the old .
sore in the north, known for years as the '
Liverpool Corner. The present outbreak he
set down to the exciting influences of the
war,which he said had aroused in the Hooli
gans a longing for carousal and what he*
called 'a spirit of attack.' "
The impression seems to be growing that
physical force is the way to cure Hooli
ganism. The Express said the day after
the C. L V. parade: "It wou!d have been
better to have a score or a hundred street
rowdies stunned with the butt ends of the
volunteer rifies than to face the long record
of casualties to women and children which S
disfigured the glory of London's welcome
to its volunteers. It would be no harm to
the state if a few of the Hooligan con
tingent had their heads broken. Society
can dispense with them, and a little ju
dicious brutality would have a good effect
In teaching the brutes of the streets to
recognize law and order."
A much better suggestion has come from
several sources that a public application
of the cat-o'-nine-tatis would do more than'
anything e'se to discourage the Hooligan.
He is proud of a prison record, but his girl
wouldn't look at him after he had been
birched in the presence of her rivals.

"OPERATIVE WORDS."
What They Mean in Legal and Basil
nesx Transactions.
"'Operative words,' said a member of
the District bar to a Star reporter, "are of
the utmost importance in legal documents
and in business affairs.
"Probably the most seriously important
operative word in human affairs is com
posed of but three letters, and it appears
in print thus: 'Yes.' When she says 'yet'
to a man it means that she transfers L.er
heart and hand and formerly all of her
property to him who asks her to be, etc.
This little word establishes the most Im- .
pcrtant contract of society, and, while this
contract may afterward be dissolved by
mutual consent, if one of the contracting
parties demurs and backs out a suit for
damages is open to the other.
"In auction sales the property put up is
anybody's until the auctioneer says 'gone'
or 'sold' and the hammer drops. No mat
ter how the sale is regretted, or how much
the parties would like to retract it, it
stands and the co'urts will sustain it.L
"In a will they are 'give, devise and be- ,
qceath.' Real property is 'devised' and
personal property 'bequeathed.'
"In a note the borrower must 'promise'
to pay, and in a bond he must 'bind' him
self.
"In some states in a deed certain words
are necessary to convey real estate, The
courts have held generally, however, that
the word 'grant' will carry a good title.
In New York, for instance, the operative.
words constitute quite a formula, and are
'grant, bargain, sell, assign, transfer, set
over and convey.' That's the old form.
Now the words 'grant and release' are suin
cient.
"In a lease the word 'let' must be used.
They have an odd formula in New York,
used for centuries, probably, consisting of
'grant, demise and to farm let,' and it ap
plIes to all kinds of property. In a quit
claim deed the words 'quit-claim' must be
used."
Much Overrated,
From the Chicago rost.
"That city nman that was visiting me Is
overrated," remarked the farmer.
"How so?"
"Oh, the papers all said he wlas a great
hand at watering stock, but I found he
couldn't work the pump five minutes with
out laming his arm."
