THE PEACraHS
The Work of the Two Commissions Is All
But
ROUGH DRAFT
The Only Concession Spain is Granted
is a Commercial Privilege for Which
She Was Negotiating When the
War Broke Out.
Paris, Dec. 6. The peace of Paris is practically an accomplished fact.
Today's session disposed of the essential features of the treaty, whicb will
be embodied in the following eight articles:
First. The customary preface of treaties, in the nature of an expression
of amity and of a hope of perpetual peace.
Second. The relinquishment by Spain of her sovereignity over Cuba:
Third. The withdrawal of the Spanish troops.
Fourth. The- relinquishment by Spain of her sovereignty over Porto ,
Rico. !
Fifth. Spain's cession of the Philippines.
Sixth. The withdrawal of the Spanish troops there.
Seventh. Payment by the United States of $20,000,000 for the Philip
pines. - 'a
Eighth. Provision for an "open door" commercial policy in the Philip
pines. - ;
The rough draft of the treaty, which may be considerably changed, cov
ers these proposals. It makes a long document which Senator Davis of the
United States peace comm'ssion says WjII be found to be one of the most in
teresting papers in its character ever written. So completely are the details
of the evacuation of the Philippines stipulated that a commission such as
was arranged for the Spanish withdrawal from the West Indies will be un
necessary. Among the questions not yet settled, however, are a coaling station and
religious freedom in the Carolines, the Spanish commission not having re
plied to the American offer. The Americans have agreed to transport the
Spanish prisoners home, including (the garrison and sailors at Manila cap
tured by Admiral Dewey and General Merritt, as well as the so'dicrs and
civilians' held by the Filipinos, whose return the Americans have guaran
teed as compensation for Spain's promise to liberate all Cuban, Porto Rican
and Philippine political prisoners. Spanish soldiers electing to remain in the
colonies may do so, but it is more a macter of economy for the Americans to
ret'urn the others, as they must be fed as they are kept, and Spain is unable to
bear the expense of the repatriation.
Also the Americans have rejectc d Spain's request for free shipping for
ten. years in Cuban and Porto Rican waters, they having given 'the Spanish
commissioners such poor consolation a s ine latter may derive from permis
sion to reapply when diplomatic relations have been renewed for shipping
concessions under the reciprocity scheme of the Dingley law, for which
Senor Dupuy de Lome was negotiating in Washington iwhen the war broke
out ,
There are still under discussion eight secondary objects which the Span
ish commissioners broached last week including the status of patents and
copyrights. The American commissioners -Iay handed to Senor Montero
Rios a written reply covering these questions. Thero will probably be no
joint session tomorrow, as the Spaniards desire time (to consider this document.
THE RATIFICATION.
There is Little Tear of Op
position in the Senate.
The Treaty Contains no Clause Af
fecting a Future Policy To
ward the New Territory-
Washington, Dec. 6. (Special.)
President McKinley is confident that
the senaice will promptly ratify the
treaty of peace with Spain. The treaty
will be sent to the senate at the earliest
possible moment, but there are for
malities that may delay ics being sent
until after Christmas recess. As three
of the American peace commissioners
are members of the senate committee
on foreign relations, it is expected that
the treaty will be quickly reported to
the senate from that committee, with
the recommendation that it be ratified.
The treaty does not involve the ques
tion of a form of government for the
Philippines, nor does it bind this gov
ernment to keeping them permanently,
therefor Senator Lodge was correct
when he said: "Under the terms of
the agreement those opposing the rat-
jncation oi we treaty must ...e the un-
comforitaoie position ot opposing.-, a
treaty of peace on the ground itnau the
United States is getting too mut-h'-fiom
Spain." President McKinefy" has been
assured by a number hi senators that
they will vote for sire ratification of tne
treaty, although they are not prepared
to commit themselves in favor of per
manently retaining the Philippines.
That is a question there is plenty of
time to consider; upon which the pres
ident has not yet committed himself,
and about which more will be known
after we have run the islands under
a military government for a time.
If congress act3 as promptly as it is
expected (to do on the bill providing for
an increase of the regular army to 100,
000 men, it is not likely that any of
the volunteers will be sent to Cuba.
Nearly every senator and representa
tive who has come to Washington ha3

OF THE TREATY
called at the war department, to request
ithat some regiment cf volunteers be
mustered out, because the men while
willing to fight are not willing to re
main in the army to perform garrison
duty. The president is anxious to meet
the wishes of the men, but it cannot
bo fully done until congress provides
for the increase in the -regular army.
Already orders have been issued to
send about 6,000 regulars to Manila, m
order that some of the volunteers may
be brought home.
Representative' Mercer's "Dave," to
most of his constituents and all his
friends reputation as a hustler has
caused him to be asked ito do all sorts
cf things, not only by residents of his
own district, but by lots cf others, but

written him by a woman, contains a

How's the real estate market today?"
Representative Danford of Ohio is

I abilky to meet every responsibility
) which confronts us, Whether U be as
( suhietf from choice or from a sense of
l"iluty and humanity. He said on the
' subject: "That the American people
I are competent to own and manage the
j territory wrested from Spain is in the
iaitture-of a self-evident proposition. Mr.
? Carnegie is making more fuss by the
' expression of his fears as to our com-
peteney than anybody else, and I sus-
pect that if Mr. Carnegie's doubts were
! analyzed ii; would be found that his
' anti-expansion views grow out of his

i privileges with the United States in the
Philippines. If he could get a shade
i of advantage for the sale of his steel
I produces over these, I think, he would
j be as good an 'imperialist' as any."
j President and Mrs. McKinley have
j been presented, by Mr. J. D. Robinson,
! secretary of the Libby Glass company,
1 of Toledo, Ohio, with the largest cut
j glass punch bowl ever made. Mr. Rob-
inson is a democrat, but a strong ad
mirer or President McKinley s policy
and his personal friend. The punch
bowl is cut lo represent the stars and
stripes, and on tha sides are six shileds,
each with thirteen stars to represent
the original states of the Union. Scat
tered around the bowl are forty-five
large stars to represent the scates now
in the Union. The president has sev
eral reasons for appreciating this
splendid gift, not the least of which is
that it is American made and a con
stant reminder that tine establishment
of the industry of cutting glass in the
United States, which opponents of the
republican party ence declared to be an
impossibility, and which now rivals
both in extent and workmanship that
produced by any country on earth, was
the direct result of republican efforts.
One of the. first results of American
possession of the Philippines will be
the squelching of Aguinaldo and his
pinc'hbaok government ami the rtis
bandment of his army. Officials do not
anticipate chat any trouble will follow
when Aguinaldo is ordered to disarm
his followers and to tell them to re
sume iMieir ordinary occupations, but
if there is any trouble it will be short
and decisive, as there are enough
American troops now at Manila to
make snort work of whipping Aguinal
do's forces im.o obedience, should it be
come necessary.

Baldwin:
"The burning of .the Baldwin hotel
will probably bankrupt J. C. Baldwin,
whose sobriquet of "Lucky" was gained
through the sudden fortune he amassed
in the Ophir mine deal. While the as
sessed valua;ion of the property beld
by Baldwin still runs into the millions,
it has been known for some time that
ha was very hard pressed for ready
money. He has even been known to
renew notes for a few hundred dollars
which he never did before in his finan
cial history. Thera is but about $300,
000 insurance on the hotel, and only
about $100,000 of this was on the build

of $900,000. It will not only take the
newly initiated colonial policy.
which the hotel stood, to pay this mort
; gage indebtedness, and even then will
j leave a deficiency of at least $200,000.
j As this was the only dividend paying
i property owned by Baldwin, his ranch
proving a losing investment, he will

ANOTHER POINT SETTLED
Spain Will Not be Given Equal Com

Paris, Dec. 6. The joint commis

as this dispatch was ent. It has de
veloped that yesterday's session was
of far greater importance than was
generally supposed. It resulted in the
Americans uncompromisingly rejecting
Spain's request that for a term of years
the ships of that country and its pro
ducts be admitted to Cuban and Porto
Rican ports under the same regulations
and customs tariff as American ships
and products. The Spanish commis

HE DRAWS THE
The Senator Deplores the Course of the
Administration Calculated to Turn a
Nation of Traders Into a Nation
of Warriors. ,
Washington, Dee. 6. The first note of the anti-expansionists was sounded
in the senate today by Senator Vest of Missouri, who introduced the follow
ing joint resolution: "That under the constitution of the United States no
power is given to the federal government to acquire territory to be held and
governed permanently as colonies. The colonial system of European nations
cannot be established under our present constitution, but all territory -acquired
by the government, 'except such small amounts as may be necessary
for coaling stations, the correction of boundaries and similar governmental
purposes, must be acquired and governed with the purpose of ultimately or
ganizing such a territory into stares suitable for admission into the Union."
A brief discussion of the navigation laws was precipitated by the consid
eration of a bill amending those laws by the addition of a provision that
foreign built vessels wrecked in the United States, purchased by citizens of
this country and repaired to the extent of three-fourths of their value, shall
be subject to forfeiture if they engage subsequently in the coastwise trade of
the United States. Mr. Vest, member of ithe committee on commerce, ex
pressed his opposition to the bill, principally because it afforded protection
to tha coastwise trade, which needs no protection.
Our general carrying trade, Mr. Vest believed, needs protection. Under
the present system of navigation laws this trade had decreased from 75 per
cent to 11 per cent, and this country,
foreign shipowners for carrying the trade that ought to be carried in Amer
ican bottoms. This condition of affairs, Mr. Vest declared, was a "scandal
and disgrace." He said he had been amused at the suggestion of the presi
dent, made, in his message submitted yesterday, that our carrying trade be
encouraged by tne payment of subsidies. ...... " i
"In other words," said he, "it is proposed to substitute, for the present
vicious system of navigation laws a scheme of subsidies that is even; more
vicious than is the evil it is proposed to remedy. Under the proposed policy ii
the administration," continued Mr. Vest, "we are to build a great navy, we
are to cease to be a nation of traders, and under the impulse of the policy
of expansion, become a nation of warriors. It would appear to me to be better
first to build Aip our carrying trade. I would also let pur people, through tha
beneficent efforts of such trade buy where they can' buy cheapest."
Mr. Caffery of Louisiana, also a member of the committee on commerce,
opposed the bill. Finally it was made
1:30 p. m. the senate adjourned.

ernment of the islands as a portion of the United States. Three, bills are

HOLLAND A SUCCESS.
jA Favorable Report of Her Made to
i the Navy Department.
Washington, Dec. 6. A favorable re
port on the practicability of the sub
marine torpedo boat Holland has been
made at the navy department by the
board of inspectors and survey.
The members of tha board were on
the Holland during the Tecent test, and
found that the unique craft was all
the builders said she was. They rec
ommend, however, that a further test
be made under war conditions. This
test will not take place for about a
month, as, in the opinion of the board,
the Holland's crew needs thaiS length
of time to become thoroughly accus
tomed to its duties. According to the
board the crew is somewhat raw, and
needs training to insure proper hand
ling of the boat.
The "war test" will be conducted
over, or rather under, a mile course. In
the course of the course an old vessel
will be anchored and to make the test
a success the Holland must rise to the
surface, discharge a torpedo effective- -ly
at the hulk and then disappear be-
dep'
plishment of this programme.
