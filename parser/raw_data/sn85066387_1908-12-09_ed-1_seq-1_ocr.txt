BOAS' LIFE
THREATENED
BY WILSON
Police Find Two Witnesses Who
Will Tell of Quarrel Over
Collections
Woman's Name Is Drawn Into
Mystery, but Withheld by
the Police
Letter Found by The Call in
{ Coroner's Office Intensifies
Case Against Suspect
Brother of Dead Electrician Ac
cuses Prisoner of Embezzle
ment After Tragedy
WITNESSES who heard and
saw John Walter Wilson
threaten the life of Henry J.
Boas, his employer, have been
found, the police declare, and complete
the case against the man now held in
detinue by the police "on suspicion of
sent strychnine, disguised as
indigestion powders, to Boas. Coinci
<!entally there is drawn into the mys
tery the name of a woman which the
\u25a0police have not divulged.
James Kelly, captain, of defectives,
said yesterday that Walter Wilson will
not be charged with murder until- after
the coroner's inquest, but that a com
plaint will be filed then. The inquest
may be held on next Tuesday.
Theodore Kytka, the handwriting ex
pert, and Captain Kelly are both con
fident and sure that Wilson wrote the i
poison letter to Boas.
Letter Found by The Call
That confidence was reassured yes- j
uirday through the discovery by The j
Call in the files of the coroner's office
ct a letter written to the coroner by
Wilson on February 4 of this year.
The letter asked if his wife. Mrs. Mary
Wilson, bad applied to the city for
public burial of an infant -child.-
The letter is resurrected at this time
to indicate by its chirography that
Wilson sent the poison to Boas and also
to show the extent of the neglect to
which the' murder suspect subjected his
wife.
The new witnesses found by the po
lice will tell on the witness stand, it j
is asserted, that in their presence Wil- |
son threatened to take the life of Boas.
The two men were, at the time, having
one of their frequent quarrels ov«r
Wilson's dereliction in collecting money
for Boas. Boas had pressed some cus
tomers for money he believed to be
due. They replied by, exhibiting re
ceipts for the sums signed by Wilson.
Violent Quarrel and Threat
A violent row ensued between the
two men, and Wilson is said to have
uttered the words which may send
him to., the gallows. With the gain
of that testimony Captain Kelly cx
prCEsed his positive belief that Wilson
was the slayer of Boas.
. " Monday Captain Kelly confined him
eelf to the statement that he was sure
that Wilson had written the "poison"
letter to Boas. Yesterday, he ampli
fied that statement significantly by de
claring that he was positive that Wil
son was responsible for Boas' death.
John Boas, a brother of the deceased
electrician, stated last evening that he
learned that Wilson was almost ghoul
ieh in his embezzlements. Last Wednes
day night Boas took the fatal poison.
On the Friday following Wilson went
to the Superior electrical company.
Lynch avenue, back of the mint, and
collected }10 on an account. He did
not report the collection to the Boas
family and turn over the money. On
Saturday Wilson's collections were in
terrupted by his arreet on suspicion of
having murdered Boas.
Wilson Loses Confidence
So far, Wilson has been a stolid pris
oner. But by slight degrees his confi
dence is ebbing. The first important
•break in his first story came yester
day. He admitted writing the letter
to' the war department signed "Al
bert Walter Wilson," which was used
by Theodore Kytka as the exemplar to
connect him with the killing of Boas.
That letter was originally produced in
The Call.
Wilson will be forced today to iden
tify the letter found on the files of the
coroner's office and which is considered
by Kytka to be the most damning piece
of" evidence against the man. The let
ter follows:
"San Francisco, Feb. 4, '08.

very shadow of the city; hall in this
city and less than half a mile from
the business center a riot in which
religious fanatics and police were the
participants -and in which 100 shots
were fired this afternoon resulted in
the death of one policeman, fatal in
juries to three and slight injuries to
two other persons.
- Tlie dead:
Albert O. Dal bo vr, a patrolman.
Fatally injured:
' John ' Sharp, known as ••Adam God,"
a Ktrcet preacher.
Michael Mullunc, policeman.
Patrick; Clark, a police .sergeant.
Slightly injured: Harry E. Stege, po
liceman; George M. Holt., probation'of
ficer. The trouble occurred at 4
o'clock in the afternoon when . trie
streets were crowded with persons.
Trouble Begins
George M. Holt, probation officer of
the juvenile court and a pioneer in the
work. of savins' boys from the streets
in this city, went .to. Fifth and Main
streets to investigate a case of - al
leged abduction which had: reached
him. Near that street corner he came
upon Sharp, who, surrounded by-, his
companions, was exhorting: a crowd of
street loafers. With Sharp wore A. J.
Selzer, a woman' and five 'children. The
children ransred in acre from 14 to 3
years. — - • , •\u25a0•'-
' . Holt accosted the woman and- in
quired as to the identity of 'the chil
dren. The woman replied sharply, that
the officer "had better attend 1 to his own
business."
...... .--\u25a0\u25a0.- • ' • /
"Adam God" then struck Holt a heavy
blow behind the ear with his revolver,
making an ugly wound. Holt rushed
into the police station. The police ser
geant ordered Patrolmen Charles Dal
bow and Harry E. Stege to arrest Sharp
and his followers. -
Volley of Bullets
The officers were not prepared for the
volley of bullets which met them as
they appeared. Dalbovv was instantly
killed and a bullet passed; through
Stege's arm.^ Other officers rushed into
the street _and a general battle ensued.
But the officers were unable to shoot
without endangering the lives of inno
cent persons. Lieutenant Clark was
shot in the eye and Patrolman Mulane
was shot in the back.
In the. meantime a riot call had been
sounded and policemen were appearing
from all directions. The officers crowd
ed in on Sharp and his followers, firing
as they went. "Adam God" was shot
through the head and body. ?
The woman and some of the children
escaped and fled to a houseboat on
the river. The police, 50 in number,
followed. The woman had barricaded
herself in the houseboat, where she
defied the officers.
Standing on the porch of the boat
with . a shotgun she shouted to the
officers: "Come on, you fiends."
The boat was but a few feet from
the bank and several officers, taking
up the woman's challenge, dashedfor
ward. ;
Woman Tries to Flee
The woman dropped her weapon and
taking* two of the children she ran
back of the boat, cut loose a rowboat
and began to row toward the middle
of 'the Missouri river.
The officers calledto her to stop,, but
she only plied her oars more vigor
ously. Without another warning the
police fired a volley at the boat. One
of the shots struck Lola Pratt, aged
13 years, tearing away the greater part
of the child's face. . She died from her
wounds tonight.
The woman then surrendered. She
said her name was Mrs. Pratt, arid
that she was the wife of the companion
of "Adam. God," and the mother of the
wounded child. •

Bay Cities 111 From Dread
Ptomaine
Scores Who Ate Sandwiches at
Prometheus' Launching Un
der Doctors' Care
WHILE TOO persons in Vallejo
and, the bay cities are still
suffering from the effects of
ptomaine poisoning from the
food eaten at the luncheon following
Saturday's celebration at the navy
yard, the physicians have traced the
widespread sickness to decomposed
ham and tainted beef supplied by tha
caterer. A careful Inspection of the
food made by Dr. J. J. Hogan of Val
lejo led to the discovery that the
poison lurked in the meats. The
luncheon was furnished by the Leon
Conn catering company of US Central
avenue. It is charged that pressed
beef was supplied by Cohn instead of
fresh -meat, as called for in the con-
Rigid Inquiry
The commercial and laoor organiza
tions oJ. Vallejo have taken the matter
up and will institute a rigid inquiry.
Cohn's contract called for luncheon for
3,000 : persons at 50 cents . a . plate, for
a total of $I,SUO. He has already re
ceived J'SO, but the remainder will be
withheld pending the investigation.
Cohn declared last night that he had
believed the beef and bam of good
quality /when he purchased It. He re
fused to discuss- the matter at any
length. - •
" A chemical examination will be made
of the food by Charles Tribell, cheml3t
of the Mare island yard. Drl Frank
Anderson, medical inspector ' of the
yard, will also make an investigation.
Six hundred persons He 111 in Vallejo
and 100 more In San Francisco, Oak
land. Alaraeda and Berkeley. Although
most of the patients show signs of im
provement, some of the cases are re
garded as extremely serious.
Governor Gillett Made 111
Governor Gillett. who was a guest at
the luncheon, was taken ill in Redding
and it is stated that his sickness came
from the food he ate at the launching.
He was confined to his bed and was
under the care of a physician.
.In the Children's home in Vallejo, 125
little ones lie in pain. .The sandwiches
were sent to them by special courtesy
and the children had no sooner .eaten
them than sickness developed. Forty
two new cases appeared in the-hospi
tal yesterday.
Physicians Busy \
Some N of the Vallejo physicians have
been unable to do anything else but
attend to the poison victims. Dr.
Hogan has 81 cases under* his" special :
care. Dr. Dempsey has 52 patients.
Dr. B. J. Klotz has 18l" cases.
While -the list of victims includes
some of the most prominent persons
of Berkeley and Oakland, the great
majority of cases have occurred in
Vallejo, where the malady, has run its
