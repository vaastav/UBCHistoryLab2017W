—House at Washington Passes
Hay Army Volunteer Bill—
Mann Scents War Peril.
Borwnville, Tex., Dec. 6 —A 24-
hour battle near Tula, 40 miles below
Victoria, Tamaulipas. in {he region of
important Mexican oil fields, resulted
in a federal loss of 220. according to
a constitutionalist report received at
Matamoras from General Aguilar,
commander-in-chief in that district
Thursday. The constitutionalist loss
was not stated.
Washington, Dec. 5. —Government
officials were more confident than
ever Wednesday that the patience
which the United States had shown in
its treatment of the Mexican problem
was soon to be rewarded with a solu
tion.
After a discussion into which the
Republican leader, Mr. Mann, injected
the Mexican situation, the house
passed the Hay army volunteer bill,
which went then to the senate. This
w'ould put war volunteer forces on an
equal footing with the regular army.
The men would enlist “for the war”
and the president would appoint ali
officers.
Representative Mann said that
Chairman Hay of the military commit
tee, the administration and all others
connected with the bill w ould deny the
measure was presented now because
the government was preparing for a
war with Mexico; he recalled that just
before the Spanish-American war the
appropriations committee presented a
bill to put $50,000,000 into President
McKinley’s hands.
"I took a minute then to say,” added
Mr. Mann, "that at least there was
one man in the house who was not at
tempting to deceive himself while all
the others had said that this was not
in expectation of war, but to prevent
war.
“I fear that the same situation arises
now.”
Juarez, Dec. 5.—“1 will have 20,000

With 2,000 rebels. Villa himself, en
route from Juarez to the City of v Chi
huahua. passed through Ahumada, 85

Five thousand more rebels will .join
him on the way and with a combined
force of 7,000 men he will enter the
state capital to establish temporary
military headquarters for the constitu
tionalist party.
City of Mexico, Dec. 5. —“I have no
intention of yielding,” said President
Huerta. "Should this fighting in Mexi
co continue for years I shall continue
to do my part in it if I am still alive.”
The president’s outburst came soon
after publication of President Wilson’s
message to the American congress,
and news of the evacuation of the City
of Chihuahua by Huerta's forces.
. Juarez, Mex., Dec. 4. —Seven gener
als of the Mexican federal army are
ready to surrender and the backbone
of the Huerta dictatorship in the north
lias been broken. A peace commission
arrived in Juarez Tuesday, bearing
terms of the surrender.
Fleeing over the desert and pursued
by Villa's rebels, several thousand
persons. Including the rich Creel and
Terrazas families, who deserted Chi
huahua City in fear of a rebel attack,
were reported to be nearing the Uni
ted States border. Among the refu
gees is Luis Terrazas, head of the

MEN OPPOSE
RIGHT TO VOTE
Anti-Suffragettes Appear Before
House Body.
VOTE IS NOT NECESSARY
Mrs. Dodge Declares Ballot Seekers
Have Appeared Before Congress
and Protest is Unrea
sonable.
Washington. Dec. 6.—Asserting that
“our aim is to conserve the family
and the home,” the anti-suffragists be
fore the house rules committee Thurs
day made vigorous protests against
the demand of the suffragists that
the house create a special committee
on woman's suffrage.
Mrs. Arthur J. Dodge of New York,
president of the National association
opposed to woman’s suffrage, declared
that the suffragists have numerous
hearings before congress and that
their complaint of unfair treatment
was unfounded. She says her organ
ization is comprised of organizations
in 16 states and numbering 90,000
women all of voting age.
“When you consider that women of
our class do not relish organizing you
will see that we have a remarkably
large number of women in this move
ment,” she said.
Miss Alice Hill Chittenden, presi
dent of the New York association op
posed to woman suffrage, declared it
was not within the power of congress
to regulate suffrage in the states and
that each state should he permitted
to work out its own suffrage problem
without interference from the federal
government.
“Woman has obtained the position
she holds today without the ballot,”
said Miss Chittenden, amid applause.
“We are not the women who sit quiet
ly beside the fireside knitting in the
twilight of another generation; we are
not drones or parasites and w r e know
something of the problems of today.
Despite all that is said of the glorious
economic independence of women, all
persons recognize the limitations of
women. Women may chafe and fret
under these limitations, but it would
be as useless to halt the stars in their
course as to prevent the natural phys
ilogolical trend of the sex.
“We seek to conserve the home and
family life where woman makes for
righteousness of the nation. We seek
to make woman man's helpmeet, not
his rival and competitor. We stand
finally for the conservation of wom
en’s energies.”
Dr. Anna Howard Shaw, president
of the National Woman Suffrage asso
ciation, who has served nine terms as
head of the organization, was re-elect
ed. Doctor Shaw received 326 votes
against 4 votes for her tiearest com
petitor, Harriet T. Upton of Ohio.
First Vice-President Jane Addams
of Chicago had no opposition, receiv
ing 349 votes.
President Wilson consented to re
ceive a delegation of suffragists, who
will plead with the nation's executive
in person for his support in the cam
paign for a constitutional provision
giving women the right to vote.

HOLD-UP MAN INSANE
ESCAPED LUNATIC ATTEMPTS TO
ROB BANK AT 9MRO.
Reuben Peck cf Ashland Imagined He
Owned All Money in Universe —
Is Overpowered by Citizens.
Omro.—“Throw up your hands. 1
own all the money in the universe
and I vant you to hand out all you
got. ' This was the remark which
greeted Cashier A. .1. Marble of the
Farmers bank when he turned to his
window and was confronted with a
big, loaded revolver in the hands of
a bewhiskered and stern looking
man.
But the cashier was of an argu
mentative turn of mind. In fact, he
“had to be shown.” So he asked the
wouldbe robber to show proof of his
unbounded wealth and while he ar
gued with the man one of his assist
ants sounded the burglar alarm.
Villagers, armed like Mexican reb
els, rushed forth and marched in
military style to the bank, with Mar
shal Leon Hoover as commander in
chief. Plans for a quick and decisive
battle were made and practiced. Then
there was a rush for the bank. Brave |
and hardy volunteers rushed in, only
to be covered by the same big black
gun. But the robber here showed j
poor judgment, for Cashier Marble
made an attack from the rear and
the annihilation was complete.
Reuben Peck of Ashland, the rob
ber, is now jailed at Oshkosh and !
plans are being made for his return ‘
to the Northern Hospital for Insane, j
where he formerly resided.

Poultrymen Claim That Egg Produc
ers Are Taking Long-Needed
Rest.
La Crosse.—The hens are tired out
and eggs will be high until they get
a rest, or until the pullets grow to
the age of production, say a score of
Western Wisconsin farmers, here
at the annual show of the
Western Wisconsin Poultry as
sociation. “Eggs are bringing
the farmers 30 cents,” said Clarence
Hawley, “whereas we got only 22c to
25c a year ago at this time. The rea
son is simply that last winter was an
open winter, and the hens kept on
laying all winter. That drove the
price down then. They had been lay
ing all fall, and they continued
through the winter, spring and sum
mer and most of this fall, and I’ll
tell you the hens are Tayed’ out.”

ED AS AN OPENING GUN IN
SENATORSHIP FIGHT.
MAKES PLEA FOR SUPPORT
I-auds Farmers and Roasts La Follet
te-Morris Combination for Oppos
ing Marketing Bills as Ruralites
Listen and Cheer.
La Crosse.—Supporting his plan for
the creation of a market commission
in forceful style. Gov. Francis E. Mc-
Govern in an address to the state con
vention of the Society of Equity, lired
what was regarded by many as the
initial gun in a campaign for United
States senator.
The governor was given an ovation
by the farmers, who filled the hall.
Shouts of approval of his ideas on
marketing were frequently made.
Double significance is given the in
cident by the fact that this is the
home of Tom Morris, already an avow
ed candidate for senator. The gov
ernor did not hesitate to make it
known that the La Follette-Morris or
ganization at the last session defeat
ed the marketing bill he favored.

ditions in Wisconsin are unsatisfac
tory. The average farmer has $1 a
day to show for his labor, he said,
after counting out maintenance and
interest charges, \\hile the average
laborer in the city earns from $3 to
$3 a day. Everybody who wants an
eight hour day knows he can not get
it in the country, he said, and it is
not surprising that there is a steadily
increasing drift from the country to
the city.
