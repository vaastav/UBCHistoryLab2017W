Boston, Mass., Doc. 3. Twenty-seven
persons perished in a fire which de
stroyed the Arciadia, a Washington

many of the lodgers could reach it.

others were fatally burned, according
-to the (factors.
The building, a five-story 15-cent ho
tel, was the worst type of fire trap. It
burned like tinder and those of its oc
cupants, all men,- who escaped, were
driven into the street almost or quite
naked, so fiercely did the flames pur
sue them. The only victim identified
-was George Adams of South Boston, the
others being burned beyond recognition.
Escape Is Cut Off.
One hundred. and soventy-threo mon
wore asleep in the lodging house when
the fire started, Leaping upward from
a lower hall, the flames cut off escape
from the upper floors by the stairway.
The only fire escape was at the rear,
rooms, and on the fifth, where most of
the fatalities occurred, was a dormi
tory lined with tiers of bunks.
Mayor Fitzgerald promised a rigid in
vestigation to fix responsibility for the
tragody.
Thin Wooden Partitions.
A casual preliminary examination
showed that the building had been re
modelled recently, the masonry walls
having been removed to make more
room and thin woodon partitions substi
tuted. These partitions did not even
reach to the ceilings, so that the flames
had free draft on each floor.
Medical Examiner Leary was to con
