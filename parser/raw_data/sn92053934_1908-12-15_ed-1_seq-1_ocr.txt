New York World Owner Severely Chastised for Or
iginal Publication of the Alleged
Panama Canal Scandal.
EDITOR OF THE INDIANAPOLIS NEWS, TOO
Chief Executive Declares in Special Message to
v Congress That Stories Are "Scurrilous,
Malicious and Libelous."
Washington, Dec. 15. The presi
dent's message on the Panama charges
was greeted in both houses of . con
gress today with peals of laughter. It
was, however, listened to with interest
by the legislators.
Washington, Dec. 15. President
Roosevelt today sent to the senate a
statement concerning the purchase of
the Panama canal property by the
United States, denouncing in strong
language the charges that there was
anything wrong in the acquisition by
the United States of the canal prop
erty. "Scurrllou and l-lbcloux."
"These storios," he continued, "were
first brought to my attention as pub
published In a paper in Indianapolis
called the News, edited by Delavan
Smith. These stories-were scurrilous
and libelous in character and false in
every essential particular. Smith shel
ters himself behind the excuse he
merely accepted the statements which
had appeared in a paper published in
New York, the World, owned by Jo
seph Pulitzer.
Wback at PullUer.
" ""It is Idle to gay that the Tinow
ll
character of Pulitzer and1 his paper
are such that statements in that paper
will not be believed by everybody
unfortunately thousands of persons are
ill informed in this respect and be
lieve statements they see in print, even
though they appear in a newspaper
published by Pulitzer."
In the Real Scapegoat.
After pointing out mistakes and al
leged misrepresentations on the part
of the authors of the stories, the pres
ident says Pulitzer is the real offender
end should be prosecuted for libel by
the government authorities . '

NEW AMERICAN BATTLESHIPS BETTER
THAN DREADNOUGHTS, SAYS EVANS
New York, Dec. 15. That the latest
battleships built by this country are
vastly superior to England's Dread
nought Is emphatically stated by Rear
Admiral Robley D. Evans in an article
in the latest " number of Hampton's
Broadway Magazine, wherein he strong
ly defends the. American navy and re
plies to criticisms of it made some
time ago by Henry Reuterdahl and oth
ers. VI do not fora moment claim that
the . Indiana . and lts lister ships are
equal to the Dreadnought of the Eng
lish navy," says Admiral Evans, "only
that It Is the equaj of the English ship
designed at the same time. But I do
claim .that our latest ships are vastly
Kiinerior to the Dreadnought, and I be
lieve that every fair-minded man who
has given the subject intelligent con
- Mom Hon will agree with me."
' Admiral Evans urges the superiority
of the 13-Inch guns over the 12-incn,
asserts that the change to ther lea
ser caliber- to conform to England's
tM was a most seriou3 blunder, i nis
Is chargeable, he says, to the sea-going
officers of the navy ana not, 10 any
ofnfr corns. '
Regarding the water Une armor belt,
upon himself the responsibility forvall
that was done to carry out the will of
congress. The action of the govern
ment, he says, was wholly uninfluenc
ed by' any question of who were or
were not stockholders either in the
new or old company.
Merely Examined Title-
"Our concern," he says, "was to get
the canal property, which was owned
by the French company, and to see
that the title was clear. Our transac
tions were carried on openly and were
published in detail." The United
States, he continues, did not have any
thing to do with the distribution of a
dollar of the money paid out. except
in following out the instructions of
the French court, and that under the
circumstances there wasn't the slight
est need for Mr. Cromwell to give any
information.
Given I.lMt of Stockholders!.
The president accompanies the mes
sage with a ful list of stockholders of
the New Panama Canal company of
France on Jan. 15, 1900, numbering
6,000, and those present at. the special
meeting of the company held in Feb
ruary. 1902, immediately after the ca
f'V Offer made to the UnttcTrStates to'
accept the appraisement of $40,000,000
made by the Isthmian Canal commis
sion. The lists, the president says,
were voluntarily submitted to him by
Cromwell.
All Mepi Made Public.
"So far as this government is con
cerned," concludes the president, "ev
ery step of the slightest importance
has been made public by its executive,
and every step taken in France has
there been made public by the proper
officials."
The full text of the president's
message on the canal transaction is

GLASS WORKERS
WANT BIG RAISE
Seven ' Thousand Skilled Workmen
Present New Scale Calling for 25
Per Cent Advance. "
- Cleveland, Dec. 15. A general in
crease of practically 25 per cent on
their wage scale, to take effect Dec.
19 next, will be demanded by the Na
tional Window Glass Workers. The
new scale was announced today at the
close of a five days' session of the na
tional scale committee of the union.
It will affect every window glass fac
tory In the United States, and includes
about 7,000 skilled employes. .
he says: "I am Bure, after many weeks
of close observation, that the lower
edge of the armor belt is too high
rather than too low."
It had been strenuously contended
by critics that the low location of the
belt was a vital point of weakness.
"As the upper edge of the belt is al
ways even with or above the level of
the protective belt," continues Admiral
Evans, "the danger to be apprehended
from a projectile penetrating above
the belt, beyond the wrecking effect
of such a projectile, is not due to the
amount of water that may enter the
hole. It is the damage that may be
done by such projectiles entering be
low that may cause the destruction of
the ship one projectile so placed may
cause the ship to sink by exploding
magazines or boilers,- but this Is m
probable. It will require many 12-inch
shell3 on the water line, or in any.olh
er place, to disable -or sink such a s.hip
if the officers and men know1 their bus
iness and want to fight." .,,
Admiral Evans declares the state
ment that "a wound on a . turret may
disable that turret's guns" is. absolute
ly inaccurate, unless by "wound" pen
etratlon Is meant.
