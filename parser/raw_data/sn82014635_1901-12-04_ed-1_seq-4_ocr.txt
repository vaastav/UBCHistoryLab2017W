PRESIDENT ROOSEVELT'S FIRST MESSAGE.
Despite its great length, President Roosevelt's mes
sage will have a wide reading. If not as exciting as a
romance, or as a cougar. hunt, it is intense history of the
liveliest character, impregnated by the conclusions and
convictions of an intense American, upon whom, has fallen
and all so unexpectedly, the gravest and greatest of re
sponsibilities, responsibilities which he has resolved to
be equal to, even to the commendation of his fellow-cit
izens, to seventy-six millions of them, not counting those
of recent insular annexations, and without regard to party
predilections.
President Roosevelt, having briefly recited the details
of the awful tragedy of the Pan-American Exposition, opens
his message with the declaration that the victim of that
tragedy was the most widely loved man in all the United
States, following which is a beautiful and truthful tribute
to the lamented McKinleyy a tribute which will be read
with interest by patriots everywhere. Before quitting the
question of the president's assassination, his successor de
clares that the anarchist is a criminal who must be sum
marily dealt with, as such, by law, a criminal whom no
form of government could prove acceptable, and who if
not suppressed will annihilate all government. He, there
fore, urges congressional action.
The next problem taken up in the message Is one which
has been concerning every observant business man. Every
body is desirous for a continuance of the present prosper
ous conditions. The president warns the people against
the possible calamitous consequences of speculative folly.
Giving due credit to the financial captains who have headed
great enterprises, he couples such credit with, a warning
and the recommedatiqn that legal restraints be thrown
around the trust evil, which restraints should be made
effective through governmental supervision, in which con
nection he advises an additional cabinet officer to be known
an the secretary of commerce and industries. In fact,
running all through the questions of business, of industries,
of trusts, of immigration and of the Chinese question, the.
president makes the interest of the farmer and of the
laborer prominent, if not paramount.
The message declares against any general change in
the tariff laws, holding that reciprocity must be treated as
the hand-maiden of protection, both being Republican pol
icies and principles.
The west, or in fact all the interior portions of the
country, will be glad to note that President Roosevelt is -which have the most satisfactory banking systems have
MORE CURRENCY TINKERING.
It looks as if the country would never cease tinkerin
with the money question. It is always the old song and
dance of a non-elastic currency, mixed with greenbacks and
an unredeemable shiri-plaster, on a silver basis or by
gold standard. It has come to be believed that the monied
interests and itB henchmen in and out ofj congress is more
responsible for this periodical tinkering than are the peo
ple. Now comes Mr. Ridgely, the comptroller of the cur
rency, in his annual report, calling attention to the disad
vantages and derangements its operations cause in our
financial matters. He says:
"There could be 110 better illustration of this than its
operations in the last few months. The result has been
to needlessly lock up and take out of circulation vast sums
of money just at a time when it was badly needed for mov
ing crops and transacting the regular business of the
country. The relief afforded by the purchase of bonds by
the secretary of the treasury only partially and temporar
ily meets the difficulty .and repairs the damage dona The
mistake of maintaining this system after the business of
the government and the country has long outgrown it
should be corrected and the business community be given
relief from its operation in taking money out of circulation
when most needed. If the secretary of the treasury is
given authority so that he can arrange and have more of
the money collected deposited with the national banks and
kept there until needed, it can be done under such regula
tions, restrictions and supervision as to insure the govern
ment against loss and give relief from the present system."
Referring to the criticism which has been made of the
act of March 14, 1900, to the effect that it does not prop
erly safeguard the gold standard, but leaves it possible
for the secretary of the treasury to practically undo the
effect of the act by departmental action and regulation
without further legislation, the comptroller says:
"If the act can be made stronger by amendments and
the gold standard of value rendered more secure from
any future uncertainty, it should be done without any delay,
while the question is still uppermost, and before it gets
shoved to one side by the great number of new questions
being urged as subjects for congress.
"Since the passage of the act of March 14, 1900, the
total amount of circulation outstanding has been increased
from $254,02G,230 to $359,832,715, an increase of $105,S06,230
or over 41 per cent
"The provisions of the act have also added somewhat
to the elasticity of the national bank currency. It, how
ever, leaves much to be desired in the way of elasticity,
the lack of which is the greatest fault of our national bank
issues.
"Congress has already had under discussion and consid
eration various measures for the modification of the na
tional bank currency. There is much discussion of the
subject by bankers and financiers, and many plans are
urged for adoption. Somewhere between the views of the
ardent advocates of asset currency and those who oppose
it with vehemence as unsafe and unsound in every re
spect, there should be found safe middle ground. Most of
the more enlightened countries of the world and those

aware of the Inefficiency or lameness of the interstate
commerce law for the regulation of equtable rates and the
lack of power in the commissioners under that law to
crush out discriminations. The railroad, in being a public
servant, should be compelled to serve all on like terms,
other things being equal. He stands for the up-building
of a merchant marine, for the construction of the Isthmian
canal, for the maintenance of the Monroe Doctrine, and
for all the measures advocated by the Republican party,
and with the like spirit and earnestness of McKinley. As
for the Philippines, he says we must hold these very rich
tropical islands of both a legal and moral necessity, as a
duty to humanity, to the islanders and to ourselves.
The president stands firmly by the civil service law,
convinced that in the merit system alone is efficiency in
public service possible. There must not be, he urges, any
partisanship in the governing and control of the Philip
pines, or other colonies. As for the Indian, so long a
domestic and expensive ward of the nation, the president
holds that the time has finally arrived when Mr. Lo must
be recognized as an individual and made to take the part
of a citizen to the manner born. Tribal relations, and
reservation holdings In common, are no longer feasible.
The Indian must line up to the front or fall back to the
tear, on his own responsibility, and not expect to dawdle
his life away waiting for tho payment of his next annuity.
Commending the St. Louis Exposition in commemora
tion of tho greatest single expansion of the country, with
a good word for the results of the Pan-American and a
sympathetic allusion to the death of Queen Victoria, the
message closes.
some kind of asset banking currency. "We should be able
to incorporate some features of this kind with our national
bank currency in such a way as to in no way impair its safety
but add to its efficiency and usefulness in other respects.
Under proper laws an asset currency can be used to sup
ply an emergency circulation, for which there is a pressing
need not now supplied by our national banks, and as our
people become more used to it and see its good points the
use may be extended. Progress in this direction should
be and will have to be slow. The absolute security of our
national bank notes and the fact that no one ever looks
at a note to see by what bank it is issued, has popularized
them with our people, ' and there will always be a strong
sentiment in favor of letting well enough alone when it
comes to changing our bank notes.
"This question is, however, becoming pressing and im
mediate. In the near future it will have to be determined
by congress what shall be done with the national banks
and their circulating notes, and what changes are to be
made in the various kinds of paper money now in circulation."
If there are any sufficient reason why a
married man should so into the army.
Louis Tappan had them. His five years
of married life had been a cumulative
failure and lie know it. "What was more
important, however, his young -wife knew
and charged the whole score of their mu
tual disappointment to him. Their one
childv now a teething baby, had not heal
ed their chafed spirits nor brought to
gether their wandering hearts. Mrs.
Tappan was a good little woman, so good
that she neither sympathized with nor
understood Louis' puerile ways, his pas
sions for excitement, his slavery to habits
that were neither necessary to her happi
ness nor warranted by his slender means,
even In the days when he earned a
good salary as bookkeeper for the Buena
Vista J3ank.
Her father owned the little town where
they lived, but he was one of those stern
men, who having made their own way in
the world, would discourage and resent
the idea that they should give aid to oth
ers In the fight for Independence or
wealth. When Louis married Lucy Hard
ing he admitted himself that the old bank
president was "a grouch." but in those
days his self confidence was not shaken
by the prospect of working out a way for
himself and Lucy. For a year he carried
out his good resolutions, and even won a
measure of Mr. Harding's crabbed re
gard. During that year the young peo
ple were fairly happy. The entering
wedge of misery came when it dawned
on Lucy that Louis didn't have any reli
gion and couldn't "get" any.
Vfter that his descent was rapid. They
drifted further and further apart. The
boy, ho was only 23, lost his grip on good
resolves and slid along the smooth and
winsome current of his old, free habits.
The row with Harding didn t come till
the second year, but after that Louis
place in his father-in-law's bank became
precarious. Tho old man warned, threat
ened and even persecuted him in the mis
taken belief that he could scare the young
husband back into the narrow path. But
Louis didn't scare worth a cent. Long
before the baby came he was in debt
neck and crop. His wife was getting
morose and quarrelsome, and his credi
tors were beginning to talk about "going

bad way even before the grocer.
who was a deacon in Harding's church,
made what Loui3 called a "holler" about
his bill.
That settled the young man with Papa
Harding. A month's notice, a threat of
starvation and a mumbled imprecation
were what the bookkeeper got with his
next pay envelope. After he was out
of his position he made a few feeble ef
forts to find work; he made a trip to
Chicago and in a weak way determined to
take his wife and make a home for him
self elsewhere. But somehow the world
seemed to have suddenly grown very
narrow and selfish. His comrades of dis
sipated days and nights couldn't help him
further than o 4'hope the old man will
come round all right" and buy another
drink! Harding didn't come round. He
Ignored his son-in-law when they met on
the street, and only when the child was
born did he insist on taking charge of
Lucy. After she was taken to the Hard
ing home Louis' heart began to fall him.
He discovered that ho was fond and apt
t6 grow fonder of the child a boy. Brok
en In spirit and pocket, he swore he'd
mend his ways and find work. But there
was none. He went to Chicago, met an
old companion, forgot his troubles for a
night and a day and came to bis dreary
senses in the blue, ill fitting uniform of
a "rookie."
WHERIN GREAT DOCTORS DISAGREE.
due .rgaie, a ieaamg ivansas uemocratic light, in
sists that the tariff will be the issue in the next national
campaign, but Bryan says it will be anti-insular annexation.
Well, the Republican party is ready for either of these
issues, or both, but it hopes that the Democratic doctors
may get together. The Republican party will stand upon
what they have done in both of these directions. Bryan
urges the Democrats in congress not to forget the Philip
pine question, which he declares to be the greatest issue
before the people. He calls attention to the fact that the
Kansas City platform demanded consideration of it, and
he quotes the plan as outlined, as follows:
"An Immediate declaration of the nation's purpose to
give the Filipinos, first, a stable government; second, in
dependence; and, third, protection from outside Interfer
ence, much as has been given for nearly a quarter of a
century to the republics of Central and South America.
"In view of the fact that over a year has passed without
the settlement of strife in the islands promised by the
Republicans, and without a definite Philippine policy being
announced by the administration, it is very evident that
the Philippine question is still an issue."
Colonel William Jennings Bryan should give President
Roosevelt's Republican message on the Philippine situation
his prayerful attention.
'
King Edward ordered Sousa to play the "Star-Spangled
Banner" twice. Perhaps Edward had forgotten that those
bombs which were bursting in the air were touched off
by British.
SENATOR BURTON AND HIS APPOINTEES.
Senator Burton of Kansas is borrowing his troubles
along with his triumphs. The news from Washington
that following tho turning down of his candidate for United
States attorney for the district of Kansas, the president has
assured him that Jim Simpson's name will be sent to the
senate as revenue collector for this state. In connection
with this news comes word that Secretary Hitchcock of
the interior refuses to O. K. Z. T. Burton of Montana, Sen
ator Eurton's brother, for the attorney ship of the Chick
asaws, and Secretary Hitchcock has the last say in mat
ters pertaining to all Indian interests. The place has
been held, till within a short time, by Senator Burton him
self, the salary of the position being five thousand dollars
per annum. Senator Barton, while discussing the political
situation with the president tho other day, was Informed
that the chief executive's ideas of political reward do not
coincide with those of the United States senator from Kan
sas, thereupon quite a lively discussion ensued. Burton,
It is paid, holding his own In a very creditable degree.
Th? Lawrence Journal, in commenting on the Kansas
situation, says:
"Thre is much uneasiness in high political circles of
Kansas, and the 'boys' are on nettles. The cause !s the
inaction of the president. Several valliant patriots were
1 illed to hojrfn drawing their salaries some time ago, but

He had a vague idea that he would "win

had just begun; visions of coming home a

crowded his boyish mind, and with his
hopes there mingled, stinging' sweet", the
sense that at last he might have brought
home to Lucy and her people a realiza
tion of the fact that he was not all bad.
A scribbled note on a postal card telling
Lucy that he was "gone into the army"
was all they heard about him at Buena
Vista for three years after that. The
Hardings read all the war news with
eager curiosity at first, hoping to get
some news of Louis, but their Interest
waned again and again, to be faintly re
newed with the actual beginning of the
fight. But there was not a word about
Louis, not even his name among the
wounded, sick or dead, much less notice
of his gallantry or promotion. Not till
me Cuban and earlier Philippine cam
paigns had dwindled down into Intermit
tent skirmishes in far parts of the islands
did there come a hint that he was yet on
earth. Then just a line in the list of
"dead from disease."
"Tappan, private company K, Twenty
third infantry; dysentery."
And there ended the career of Louis
Tappan .the worthless young man of
Buena Vista.
The station agent at Culver, ten miles
below Buena Vista on the Louisvilio and
Nashville, saw the last train "hesitate"
at his door, and was getting out his key
to lock up when a well dressed swarthy
young man with a small bag dropped off
the rear coach and approached him:
"This is Culver, isn't it?"
"Tes, sir."
"Do you know where Mrs. Tappan, Jlrs.
Louis Tappan lives?"
"Don't live here, leastways not in town.
I know 'em .all. No Tappans and noth
ing like that name round here. I'm pret

"Moved here from Buena Vista," sug
gested the stranger wistfully, "moved up

"Oh, bom on. Tappan oh, her namo
