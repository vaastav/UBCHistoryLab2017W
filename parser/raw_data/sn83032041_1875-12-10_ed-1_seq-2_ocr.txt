As will be seen in another column
of our paper, lion. Michael C. Kerr, of
Indiana, was elected speaker of the
lowvr branch of Congress at its niect-
in; last Monday. The contest for this
high and responsible position, which j
has been carried on with some bitter-

We were opposed from the very com
iiu-nwmeiit of tlie struggle to the pre
tensions of ;'mul .1. Itiindall, although
he is from tins ftato. We distinctly
a id frequently stated the reasons why
we opposed his nomination and will
not now repeat them. We always re
spected his ability, but just as decid
edly doubted the policy and w isdom of
his choice. Mr. Randall, after Mr.
Kerr's nomination by the caucus, made
the following brief and exceedingly
creditable speech :
"Mr. C'liairinan, lt the wish of tlifi major
ity he tlif voire of all. From tbiH moment
the d: Iterances anione mirselveH must heat
an end, that we ma.v Mm pr-sent an united
front to dii r adversaries. Our mission on this
rt.ior must le, as far as we are alle., to restore
the government to its constitutional purposes
au. I to expose tlie corruptions of the aitinin
isl ration. A word more of a personal eliar-m-ter
to those around, who have so stealily
supported me. They have lost their choice.
Lilt have gained a life-long friend. I now
tin.ve that, the nomination of Michael C.
Kerr, of Indiana, he made unanimous."
The motion was adopted.
m-
The Secretary of the Treasury pre
sents the following estimates for the
fiscal veor of 1877:

SKi 512 less than the estimates, and
Uk estimates for the fiscal year ending
.Tune P.O. 1S77, are $,012,fi(.S larger
than estimates for the previous year.
Hut we rather fancy, to quote the lan
guage of the Pittsburgh '.f, that the
House, and it is to be hoped the Senate,
will intefere materially with these esti
mates, to tiie extent of nearly or quite
$.-,0,000,000. To begin with, :l().0(0,
000 can s saved in the War and 'avy
PepTtments, $2,000 000 for Congress,
$5,000,000 in the Interior, $10,000,000
in the Treasury Department $:,000,000
in the Postoffioe and Judicial Depart
ments, and $1,000,000 i:i other direc
tion.., or a total saving of $50,000,000
in the taxes of the people.'
The vacant Attorne- (Jeneralshipof
this State has at last been filled, (iov
crnor llartranft having on Monday
last apixiinted Hon. (Jeorge Lear, of
Bucks county, to tlie position. The
new Attorney General, as we learn
from the Ilarrisburg Patriot, was lorn
in Warwick township, ttucks county,
on February 10, 1813. His boyhood
was passeil on his father's firm, and
at the age ofnineteen he lccame en
gaged as a te.icher in she public schools
which occupation he followed for four
years. lie then filtered a country
htore, and meanwhile studied law, be
ing admitted to the bar on November
loT 1344. From 1843 to 1S50, he
served as Deputy Attorney General for
Bucks county, then being superseded
by an elected district attorney. In
172, Mr. Lear wa elected a delegate
to the constitutional convention from
the Seventh senatorial district. As a
member of the convention, he served on
the committees on "county, township
and borough officers," and on "educa
tion." Mr. Lear disapproved of the
more radical changes made by the new
constitution as finally settled by the
convention, and was one of tlie dele
gates who declined to vote for that
instrument as n whole and to sign it.
Since March. 18C5, Mr. Lear has b?n
president of the Doylestown national
bank, but his financial business has not
b?en suffered to ink r'ere with his prac
tice at the bar. Asa lawyer he has
had considerable experience, but his
pronounced opposition to the new
constitution will not tend to make his
nomination popular. It will lie taken
as i new evidence of the hostility of
H T.nti'flntt to tlie organic law
. . . , i t
U'Uii I. T..C l.s life t
Hon. Michael C. Kerr, of Indiana,
was agreed upon as- Speaker on the
third ballot, the vote standing, for
Kerr, 00 ; for Randall, CI ; for Cox, 7.
Mr. Kerr is enieef tire ablest members
of Congress, nd while he perhaps lacks
the thoronghness of a knowledge of
parliamentary law possessed by Mr.
Randall, he will fill the chair in a most
satisfactory manner. II is brilliant ami
consistent icconl of uncompromising
hostility to the Radical corruption of
the past fifteen years is a sufficient
guarantee that oQicial corruption and
Ring rascality will find no favor in his
sight. The action of Mr. Randall in
moving the unanimous nomination of
Mr. Kerr, reflects the highest credit
settled. I "P?" himself.
lion. John U. lhompson, or Uhio,
wasd esignated as Sergeant-at-A rms on
the first ballot. He is pre-eminently
fitted for the position, and the honor
could not have been moie worthily be
stowed.
For Clerk Mr. Adams, of Kentucky,
was chosen on the sixth ballot, making
the selection of the three principal
officers of the House from three ad
joining States, but which represents
nearly one-fifth of the total population
of the country. The only objection
that could possibly be made to these
selections is of a geographical charac
ter, but this can have cut little force.
Mi. Adams, who is an ex-member of
Congress, isespecially qualified for the
office.
For doorkeeper Fitshugh, of Texas,
was elected on the second ballot.
Stuart, of Virginia, was chosen iost
master on the second ballot, and Rev.
J. L. Townsend, of the Episcopal
Church, was named for Chaplain. In
the Radical caucus Speaker Blaine and
all the Radical officials of the House
were renominated, demonstrating that
the ruling passion is strong in political
death.
It now only remains for the House
to organize promptly to-day and go
boldly and intelligently to work. The
people of this country look to the
present House, not so much for leg's
Iation, as the exposure and punishment
of official corruption f that have well
nigh destroyed the country in the last
six or eii;ht years. Nor should they be
disappointed. Ofilcial thieves should
be unsparingly exposed. If there are
any men who claim to be Democrats,
and have participated in Radical
plunder.'they should be made example
of. But in the exposure of Radical
official corruption, necessary legisla
tion and legislative reforms should not
be lost sight of. The two are not in
compatible, but really gohand in hand.
The duty of the present House cannot
be misunderstood nor shou.d it be
iicsrlected.

Wr. direct the attention of our read
ers to the prospectus for 1870 of the
weekly and daily New York Sun,
which will be found in another column
of our paper. The Sun is an indepen
dent pajier and is conducted with dis
tinguished ability. Mr. Dana, its edi
tor, is a bold and fearless man the
inveterate fe of all manner of cor
ruption and dishonesty in general,
State and municipal governments
and that his efforts in that direction
are fully appreciated is attested by
the fact that the Wcclli Sun has at
tained a circulation throughtout the
country of ovci riVAy thousand copies,
while the circulation of the daily edi
tion is about forty thousand more.
We know of no city paper in any part
of the country more interesting and
entertaining than the Sun, and no
man who invests the trifling sum of
$1.20 for the weekly for one year,
with the postage prepaid, will ever re
gret the outlay, and will le remuner
ated to an extent almost incalculable.
rrl,tk.-j b-nd toobey.
Grant in his late message advocates
a constitutional amendment making it
the duty of each of the several States
to establish and forever maintain free
public schools, adequate to the educa
tion of nil the children in the rudi
mcntary branches within their respec
tive limits, irrespective of sex, color,
birth place, or religious, atheistic or
pagan views and prohibiting the grant
ing of any school funds or school tax,
or any part thereof, either by legisla
tive, municipal or other authorities for
the lienefit of any other object of a:iy
nature or kind whatever. He borrow
ed this idea from Blaine and it is, as
the'Pittsbnrgh Pout truthfully remarks,
an idiotic idea at best. The people of
the States have the patriotism to edu
cate their children without any com
pulsion from the general government.

next column.
TAXATION.
He swjrgesfs taxation of all property
equally, excepting wly the last i-estiug
plaee of the dead.
THE FOREIGN T1FXATIOXS
with most of the powers remain satisfacto
ry. Along with the message is transmit
ted certain diplomatic correspondence
showing the exact condition of fo;eign rela
tions. THE MF.XICAK TROUBLES
are next referred to at some length. The
marauding excursions, the frauds of the
United States revenue and the number of
murders and outrages on the Mexican bor
der have been made the subject of renew
ed remonstrance by the United States to
the Mexican government, but without ap
parent effect. A larger force of troops is
necessary to guard the American frontier.
The result of the joint commission on
Mexican claims will soon be communica
ted to congress. lie is happy to announce
I that Venezuela has abandoned her objec
tion to paying to the Lnited btates that
portion of its revenue allowed towards the
extinguishment of the claims of foreigners
generally, and annonnccs the ratification
of a treaty of commerce and navigation
with T'elffium, and of conventions with
the Mexican republic for the farther ex
tension of the jint commission respecting
claims with the llawaiau islands for com
mercial teciprocity, and with the Ottoman
empire for extradition, all of which have
been duly proclaimed.
The President then discusses the Ala
bama claim. One thousand three hun
dred and eighty claims have been presen
ted, of which six hundred and eighty-two
had been disposed of at the date of my re
port on the subject. One hundred and
seventy were decided during November,
and decisions are being made in the re
maining cases rapidly.
OCEAN CATU.ES.
The President then reviews the history
r of ocean cables and comments freely upon
the action of the government and cables (
in relation to the landing of the cable on J
the shores of France, and the action of the 1
Anglo-American company in endeavoring
to advance the rates upon the competition
by the direct cable.
FRAUDULENT NATURALIZATIONS
Among ihe important subjects to which
the attention of congress should be directed
are those of fraudulent naturalization and
exportation. He invifes the attention of
congress to the necessity of regulating by
law the status of American marrying in fr
eigners, and defining the statusof children
born of American parents in foreign coun
tries. The message then reviews the re
port of the Secretary of the Treasury.
IN FAVOR OF RESUMPTION.
It will be a source of great gratification
to the President to be able to approve any
measure of congress laoking effectually
toward securing resumption. Unlimited
inflation would accomplish it, but at the
hacrifice of honor.
Ilefening to the Secietary of War's re
port, he recommends a:i appropriation of
800, 000, 000 for the subsistence of the de
partment Iks fore the beginning of the next
fiscal year, and recommends the repeal of
the law abolishing mileage and the return
to the old Rystem.
lie recommends a reduction of govern
ment expenses wherever it can be done
without crippling the functions of the
government. A restoration of the duty on
tea and coffee would increase the revenue
by eight million dollars.
THE TARIFF QUESTION.
The subject of the tariff occupies consid
erable space.
REPORTS OF TIIE DEPARTMENTS.
The President, on the navy, then says :
Policy requires that we should have a larg
ernumberof torpedoships while the warlike
situation continues. The condition of the
navy, however, is, upon the whole, satis
factory. He recommends the immediate
completion of five double-turretted moni
tors now on the stock.
The report of the Postmaster General is
next discussed, and various recommenda
tions made in connection.
The thirteenth report of the interior de
partment is next reviewed. The report of
the general land office shows that there
were 245,tK)l acres less disposed of duiing
this year than last.
lie recommends that the government's
contribution to the Centennial exhibition
be of a character and quality and extent in
keeping with the dignity and credit of the
country.
The reports of the several departments
are brielly referred to. lie recommends
that a joint congressional committee be ap
pointed to visit the mining states and terri
tories next summer and report such laws as
may bo best suited for the development of
those territories.
The message closes with a recapitulation
of the various questions which the President
deems of vital importance, such as educa
tion, opposition to the teaching of sectarian
tenets in the public schools, the driving out
of licensed immoralty, polygamy, etc., and
the enacting of such laws as will insure a
speedy return to a sound currency that
will command the respect of the world.
Col. M'Clure on Grant's Message.
Commenting on this labored document,
the Philadelphia Times among other things
says: "After our relatious with Spain there
are but two questions of vital interest pre
sented in the message, beyond the usual
routiiM records and suggestions. The
dusky son of the forest who, in deciding
how he would receive his government ktt
lmitr, said, first some whisky, next a lit
tle more whisky, and finally t he rest of the
account in whisky, weM typ'fied thePresN
dent's devotion to the school question.
And like the Yankee fiddler, who always
ended every tune with Yankce Doodle,
he weaves the sectarian or educational is
sue in as the blossom that is to bear the
richest fruit, whether from thistles or fig
trees. Edncat ion is the first want of a free
people a platitude that nobody will dis
pute and then he wanders into the laby
rinths of imaginary sectarian conflicts un
til be invokes the fundamental law to help
him out. Aud from a general coramenda
tioi of education he rloundeis on to the
churehesr and demands that they shall
pay on their billion of property as-do oth
er people. Again he bobs the schools
against Jewell's Post Office Department,
aud christens them willing haud-maids of
progress, and finally he flourishes his cli
max by demanding compulsory education,
and disfranchisement, after 8J0, of all
who cannot read and write, excepting those
who were anable to doso atthe time of the
enactment of th new organic law. The
school and sectarian issues are evidently
the politieal bees that buzz in the Presi
dential bonnet, and he strikes out wildly
in his ill-considered assaults upon imagi
nary foes of free institutions." That this
is not an unjust estimate of the Presi
dent's views and purposes in this regard
will be readily inferred from the language
of the message itself on the subject of ed
ucation, which we quote fn full :
THE IMPORTANC E OF EDUCATION.
As we are now about to enter njoo onr
second Centennial, coinmenriiijp nr man
hood as a nation, it is well to look Lack upon
the pawt and study what will be -M to pre
serve ar.d advance our future greatness.
From the fall of Adam for hi transgression
to the present day, no nation has ever ben
free from threatened danger toils prosperity
and happiness. We should look lo the dan
gers threatening us and remedy th?u so far
as lies in onr power. We are a Republic,
whereof one is as good as another before the
law. Uudr such a form of government it is
of the grat"st importance that all should be
possessed of education and intelligence
enough to cist a vote with a right under
s'andingof its ineauing A large Association
of ignorant men cannot, for any considerable
period, oppose a successful resistance to ty
ranny and oppression from the educated few,
but will inevitably sink into acquiescence to
tlie will of intelligence, whether directed by
the demagogue or by priestcraft Hence the
education of the masses becomes of the first
necessity for the preservation of our institu
tions. They are worth preserving, because
they have secured the greatest good to the
greatest proportion of the population of any
form of government yet devised. All other
forms of government approach it .inst in pro
portion to the general diffusion ot" education
and independence of thought and action. As
the primary step, therefore, to our advance
ment in all that, has marked onr progress In
the past century, I suggest for your consid
eration, and most earnestly recommend it.,
that a constitutional amendment he submit
ted to the legislatures of the several States
for ratification, makinn it theduty of each of
the several States to establish and forever
maintain free public schools adequate to the
education of all the children in the rudiment
ary branches within their respective limits,
irrespective of sex, color, birl h-pi.K-e or re
ligion, forbidding the teaching in said schools
of religions, atheistic or pagan tenets, and
prohibiting the granting of any school funds
or school taxes, or any part thereof, either by
legislative, municipal or other authority, for
the lencfit or in aid, directly or indirectly,
of any religions sect or denomination, or in
aid or for the lienefit of any other object of
any nature or kind whatever.
Tweed Gives IE3 Bail. The escape
of Tweed is what Shakespeare would
call "more matter for a May morning."
The Warden of Ludlow Street Jail aud
Deputy-Sheriff IIagen went out driving in
the Park with their prisoner, and allowed
him to call at his own house, where they
sat cooling their heels in waiting while he
went up stairs to see his wife. According
to their own story, they snsected iu a little
while that he had taken Fieuch leave, and
made diligent search and gave the alarm.
Up to the present writing uo trace of the
missing man lias been discovered. If the
Warden and t lie Deputy Shetiff are not
liars and accomplices in Tweed's escape
he had nut more than a quarter of an hour
in advance of his pursuers, and for an old
man broken with the storms of state, and
fat besides, that was very Kttle. On the
other hand, if the officers aided him he may
have had several hours' start, as consider
able time intervened between his leaving
the prison and the alarm of his escape.
Uuder the most charitable construction to
be put upon theirconduct we cannot fail to
conclude that the officers iu charge of
Tweed are unfit for any public trust. If
bribed to connive at his escape, they are
scoundrels. If so silly as to trust him out
of their sight in a house with an open lot
in the rear, leading on to an avenue, they
ar too stupid to be set to watch thieves.
It is probable that they have been really
stipendiaries of the prisoner for months
granting him for a consideration those fa
vors which are always for sale at a debtors
prison. This escape is even more vexatious
than that of Genet, although Tweed had
already suffered the penalty of the crimes
lie had committed, and was in jail simply on
civil process, a.s unable to procure bail for
the amount repuired of him. It is hard to
see how he can avoid pursuit if it be vigor
ously carried oa, and whether he be recap
tured or not, his property will serve to sat
isfy judgments against him in the suits to
recover the plunder taken from the city.
His arrest was a measure of additional se
curity, but it has not proved a very effect
ive one ; for a New York jail is like a jug
cler's box things disappear out of it in
the most unaccountable fashion. Sheriff
Conner and Warden Dunham are liable
to a fine of f 1,000 and one year's imprison
ment; for their neglect, and if Tweed is
not forthceming they will be apt to get the
full benefit of the law. N. Y. World, 5t7u
A Hartford (Conn.) woman has had
four husbands, all alive still. The four
husbands, however, constitute but three
men. She changed her maiden name for
that of her first husband, got a divorce and
married a second, left him on account of
his attentions to a pretty sewing-machine
girl, now a prominent actress at a New
York theatre, and, as soon as divorced, re
married No. 1, lived with him a short time,
got another divorce, and has now married
for the fourth time a man who had been
divorced from two wives.

supposed the girl had received a fall which
caused her death. Yesterday an officer
from Watertown visited the spot and found
strong indications that the girl had been
murdered and strong evidences against a
boy aged sixteen years, named Rutar, who
lived near tho scene of the murder. It is
believed that be attempted to ravish the
girl and, failing in that, killed her with a
small hammer. He was tracked to and
from the spot and a hammer was found
which fits the indenture in the gill's fore
bead. - Rutar has been arrested.

which the traveler would feel in the heart
of the Great African Desert, with not a

The Oshkosh A'ortlietstern says s
There is a man, an inmate of the asylumr
whose skin, although a white mau, is as
black as a negro's. It was caused by a
dose of aitrate of silver which he swallowed
by accident. The acid coming through
the pores tlie fckin turned blaek by
the light of the sun and remained so. He
is ciazy, however, and is subject to fits,
dnrincr which he often falls and cuts
j himself. Tho wounds heal up with r.cw
( and white skin, thus leaving the white
scars all over his face and head, which
looks still whiter on accouut of the black
ness of the skin.

Going for a Husband She nAS Never
Seen. The Rockport Democrat sayi that
Caledonia, Livingston county, has had a
genuine romance. In substance it is that
a man, whose name is not given, left that
town about eleven years ago, and neglect
ing to write home, was given up as dead.
Eight months ago his sister, Mrs. Hackett,
received a letter from him, stating that he
was in New Mexico, and that he had made
a fortune there. She answered the letter
inclosing a picture of her daughter, Maggie
Hackett. When the long absent man re
ceived this letter in New" Mexico, he showed
the photograph of his niece to a companion,
who ws so "struck" with hei appearance
that he wrote to her, proposing marriage,
and offering to furnish the means for her
outfit journey to the west, etc.
The proposal seemed to have been
looked upon favorably by the young lady,
who answered the letter, he sending her by
return mail $300 in money, an engagement
ring, a set of jewelry, etc., and a request
that she would correspond with her uncle
as to his character, financial standing, etc.
She did so, and the uncle reported him
well to do ar.d a "perfect gentleman." It
was in due time arranged that she should
take the money and valuables and go to
New Mexico, with the understanding that,
if after becoming personally acquainted
with the lover whom she had never seen,
she was not suited he was to send her
home again. She started three weeks ago.
She is eighteen years of age, a poor work
ing girl, belonging to a respectable family.
Her lover admits to being over forty.

A HouRiBEE Butchery. About seven
o'clock on Saturday morning last, William
Aiden, an Englishman, an cxpressmau for
Cobb & Co., living on Scranton avenue,
Cleaveland, O., quarreled with his wife,
aud becoming enraged he caught up au axe
and commenced butchering ber with it,
severing her head from her body, and oth
erwise horribly mutilating ber. He then
went to the corner of Garden street, with
the axe and a hammer, aud attacked his
step-daughter, cutting her in a fearful
maimer. Mr. Benton, who attempted to
intefere, was also chopped, and pounded
with the hammer. The two latter, al
though still alive, are beyond all hope. The
bouse presented an awful appearance ;
walls and ceiling bespattered with blood,
and pools of bloody gore lying upon the
floor ; dishes broken and chairs upturned
showing that there must have been a
terrible struggle.
Aiden was arrested on Scrantou aveuue
while deliberately settling up his affairs
and locked up. lie gives as a reason for
bis triple murder that his wife, who was
a widow woman when be married her, aud
the step-daughter were stealinghim out of
bouse and borne. When questioned why
be was not satisfied with killing bis wife,
be stated tbat he wanted so put an end to
all the damned whelps for they drove him
to it. There was great excitement iu that
city over the butchery. Nothing bo horri
ble has ever before happened there.
