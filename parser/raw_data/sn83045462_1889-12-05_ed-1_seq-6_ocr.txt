PKAISE FROM THE OTHER SIDE.
A Conservative Democrat'* Opinion of
the President's Message
There are still but few men in Congress who
have read the President's menage with care
and are ready to express anything more than
a general opinion on it. The great mass of
democrats will speak of it slightingly and the
republican* will praise it, whether they have
read the message or not. Some few on both
sides, with whom The Stab reporter has talked
b ive considered the document carefully and
there is no very widejdifference in their estimate
?f it. They generally agree that it is just such
a document as they expected; that it is conser
vative in its tone and that the propositions are
clearly stated. There is a difference of opin
ion among democrats as to the declarations.
coscnxiso THE SCPEKVIHION OF ELECTIONS.
Some of the southern men declare that the
President has taken a radical position on the
subject and they are disposed to criticize him
severely. Other democrats, who have given
especial attention to this clause, say that they
reg.:rd it as conservative.
Mr. Mutclilerof Pennsylvania, speaking with
a Star reporter, stated practically what a num
ber of other thoughtful democrats had said.
He thought that the utterance on the super
vision of elections was conservative and that it
did not agree with what had come to be the
popular impression of what the policy of the
republican party would be. He said be thought
the I'resident took issue with the followers of
the Sherman Idea of a federal election law and
that, while maintaining the right of Congress
to take charge of congressional elections, held
that such action was not necessary
and not politic. He said he thought it indi
cated that the republican party was not of one
mind on this subject, and he would venture to
say that the effect of the President's message
would be to prevent the passage of any such
bill as that proposed by Senator Sherman.
SPEAKING OF THE TA&IFF CLAUSE
in the message. Mr. Mutcliler said he could not
?ee. as far as the simple declaration went, that
Mr. Harrison differed far from Mr. Cleveland,
exccpt as to the tobacco tax. He declared that
there should be an enlargement of the free list,
and for a revision of the tariff, with proper re
gird for the protection of the interests of
American capital and labor. This was practi
cally incidental protection, as Mr. Cleveland
had advocated it. It was not. in Mr. Mutcliler's
opinion, at all in accord with tha republican
platform, adopted at their last national con
vention. it was more in accordance with the
earlier platforms of the party.

ever thought of cmploving, and ITS

THAN THRKK Tl.MKS AS I'OUKR.
FI'L AN1? RAPID AS THOSK OF ANY
OTHKK WASHINGTON PAPER. It to
therefore able to print each day a full
report of every transaction of public In
terest occurring in the District up 14
the very hour of going to press.
tot
Uy the free use of the <H 'KAN CABIiFI
for REGULAR AND SPECIAL DIS
PATCH KS, and with the dlfierence of
time in its favor, it is also able to i>lvt
Its leaders e\erj afternoon the news of
the WHOLE EASTERN HEMlsPIIUCK
for the entire da>, and up to 12 o'clock
midnight, tlius leaving literally nothing
lu the way of new 8 trom Europe, Asia,
and Africa for the morning paper*.
Equally doe* THE STAR lead all Its
contemporaries in the publication of the
NEWS OF OCR OWN t Ol NTRV.
Receiving the regular dtsputchcs of
both News Assoclations; with alert and
enterprising special telegraphic cor
respondents at all importaut points; and
with wires leading directly from its own
olllceto the general net work of telegraph
system touching every city, town and
hamlet In the United States and Terri
tories, It Is enabled to receive uwl print
at oncc a lull report of every eveut of
consequence occurring during the daj
anywhere between the Atluutlc and IV
ciiic Oceans.
IT NOTE THE RESULT: J*
THK STAR HAS MOKE THAH
THREE TIMES AS MANY REGULAR
BU HSCRIIIERS and MORE THAN
FIVE TIMES AS MANY RKUILAR
READERS AS ANY OTHER DAILY
PAPER IN WASHINGTON. It Is de
livered regularly by careful carrier* at
the HOMKS OF TH K PEOPLE, AF 1KB
THE BUSTLE AND WORRY OF THK
CAY ARE OYER, and It 1* thu* read
leisurely and thoroughly by EVERY
MEMHER OF THE FAMILY.
They know that it prints all the new*,
ond has only the Interests of the people

short, to be THE PEOPLE'S PAPER,

LUTELY WITHOUT A RIVAL. It to
In fact worth more as a means of reach

Furthermore, lu proportion to the re
turns it gives its patrous, ITS AD\ Els
TIS1NG RATES ARE THE CHEAPER*
IN THE CITY.
In conclusion, the public should brar
In mind this one signlhcant fact: THK
STAR does not rely upon empty boast*
to impress the public. ITS CIRCULA
TION IS SWORN TO; IU PRESS
ROOM IS OPEN TO THE PUBLIC;
and its HOOKS MAY BE INSPECTED
by any one having an interest In their
examination. These arc CRUCIAL
TESTS, which lew papers Invite, and
which those that boast most ore Irsrt
able to stood.
to: ?
The esteem In which 1HE STAW
Is held by the reading and advertising
public Is conclusively showo by the fig
ures given below.
In the first six months of eoch of th#
?ve years named the average daily cir
culation of the paper w as:

?? 1886 24,382 "
? 1887 25,702 M
** 1888 27,066 **
" 1886 30,241 "
Equally significant Is the showing la
regard to the advertising patronage of
' the paper, which to the surest Indication
of its acknowledged value as n medium
of publicity. The number of NEYt AD
VERTISEMENTS printed In the col
umns of The Star during the first six
months of the years named was as fol
low*:

?? 1887 27,516
?? 1888 27,866
M 1886 61.676
These figures, showing constant ond
large increase In both department* ol
the paper's bu*lnes*, need no comment.
They toll the story of public confidence
possible that THK STAR IS 1HE RE
