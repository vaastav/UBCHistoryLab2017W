in a train and drove home in silence. As
tluy were about to ascend the many
stairs. v\vo women darted past them, one
supporting the other.
"Hello!" exclaimed hem. "didn't one
of them biok like our Mary?*'
"I didn't notice." replied l'aul.

{'.Hi if ii were indeed Mary, she had
vanished from sight and hearing.
Tuev crept' wearily up, up. tip. Their
quarters had never soetned so elevated
as that night, nor tin* steps so high and
far apart.
They listened at Mrs. Munro's door,
nmi from the sound ef heavy breathing
they came to the eoncluMou that the old
woman was alone and asleep.
"Come. Paul, old fellow cheer up. Ev
erything will eotne out right in the end: I
and if il doesn't, why. won't help mat- as if

been too much lor you." said hein. dis

kindly :isisting his friend to disrobe and
get into bed.

C:a. the driver, and Charles
fev were very certain, if, indeed, they
gave the subject any thought, that they
at.d "Miss Hermann were the sole occu
pants ef the carriage: but they were mis
taken.
Mary, like the sinrit of unrest, had
gone out there again. Sin* saw Cheat
ham leaving. Crouching under a tree
near bv. she saw the lights tlashing back
ami forth, and finally stopping in Mi
riam's room. She was surprised at hear
ing no outcry. And she was rooted with
amazement when she saw the shadows
ou the window blinds, of a man
ing a woman, and walking
around and around.

wearily
When Miriam was placed in the car
riage and Carpenter got in. Mary's first
impulse was to spring on him like a tig
ress ami demand to know where he was
going. Hut daring, restless ami impetu
ous though she was, she also possessed
a coo!, clear head.
When the carriage whirled off. Mary,
enveloped in her black waterproof, was
upon the circular shelf to which trunks
are often strapped, and those who saw
her clinging there thought it was a bun
dle in the right place.
When Carpenter got out of the car
riage. leaving the door open, Mary un
coiled herself and crept down. Miriam
was sitting up, stroking her hair and try
ing to look about her in the uncertain,
light ot distant lamp.
••Hush. MUs Hermann. am here—
Mary—your friend."
"Mary!" whispered the startled Mi
riam. ,x
••Yes, yes! for your life Mttor not
word! Creep out quietly. I will help
you. Here is my hand. Tint is it, brave
.. v'-'.
hike the sun bursting through agitated
storm clouds and lighting up the con
tused landscape, a gleam of calm reason,
and with it a realization of the situation,
shot across Miriam's brain, and by that
keen temporary light she acted.
She clasped Mary's hand, and cautious
ly, noiselessly crept out of the carriage.
Mary saw that the driver was looking
back, so she went ahead out by the
horses, then up to the sidewalk.
There can be no doubt but Mary would
have succeeded in getting to her own
quarters with Miriam within half an
hour but for a circumstance that she
could not have foreseen.
While Cheatham and Carpenter were
talking on the sidewalk, Sim Cheatham,
from the opposite side of the street, kept
his eyes on the carriage. JVing himself
unseen, he was enabled to watch to ad
vantage. lie saw his wife going to the
carriage door, and then he followed with
his eyes the shadowy tigures making off.
The moment Cheatham and Carpenter
parted. Sim ran to his uncle and com
municated his discovery.
••Vou are sure. Sim?'* gasped the old
man, as he wriggled hi* nock in his ban-
dngo-iike cravat, to keep from strangling.
"As sure as that I* see yon before me!"
replied Sim.
•'Which way did they goV"
Sim told him.
*'I)o you think that Mary will go to her
quarters V"
"I'm pretty sure she will."
••Very well. You see Smugg and his
gang. Tell them what we want. And
if you come up with the women, bundle
them into a carriage and gag them, if
need bo. I will hurry off and stand guard
at the corner of Wilberforee ami Tenth.**
Sim hurried off to carry our his uncle's
plan, and Cheatham, muttering curses
that, made up in depth what they lacked
in loudness, ran away to the pot he had
assigned to himself.
Mary, with her drowsy, tottering com
panion, kept in the shadows, and, before
venturing into a street, peered cautiously
round the corners, to make si.re she was
not observed. She succeeded in getting
within a few blocks of her own habita
tion. when she saw Sim and Smugg, not
a hundred feel away, turning a comer
and coming directly toward her.
She ifid not think they o-tld have seen
her, but, whether they did or not. she
must fly. I»ack a few paces she had
passed an arched entry, and, turning,
she tied into this, till stopped by a great
door, and waited.
Into the semi-circle of light the two
men advanced, then halted. She whis
pered to Miriam, whose waist her arm
encircled, to lean on her and keep good
heart: then she bent to listen.
"Well," said Smugg, "that do heal the
i'r/'iig Dutchman all out and out. Now,
l\i hav**sworn 1 saw them sink into the
ground right where we stand!"
"1 don't see \\Vj* they should want to
sink into the ground its order to disap
pear," said Situ, "hook in
4here!"
and
he pointed to the archwa.
*'hei. us go in togethu
"No: out* mu stay and watch out for
the police."
To the surprise of both, an otlieer wWI
might have risen up from the pavement
appeared on the scene. So sudden and
unexpected v.*as this apparition, that both
men turned with a guilty start.
"See here. Sim." growled the ofneer.
as he drew his locust club within easy
reach, "what are you doing here at this
time of nightV"
Sim laughed mechanically, ami said he
was out for his health.
"Walking's belter for the health than
standing still. Come, be moving on."
And the ollicer waved his hand sugges
tively.
"You're a little tough on mo." said
Sim, with a fleeted lightness, "ltul I for
give you. Good night."
He and Smugg walked off arm in arm,
they were quite devoted to each
and the oflioer, to make sure that
they did keep walking while on his beat,
followed them for two blocks,
"Courage, Miss Miriam, courage! The
danger is past." whispered Mary.
Miriam, who had been sleeping as they
I stood there, roused on hearing the voice
and moved wearily on. Mary, with her
irpen-! charge, reached the corner of the street
ilireetly across from the high building in
which she lived, and was about to cross
over, when she saw and recognized Cheat
ham on the opposite side. He certainly
did not see her, for he walked back and
forth, looking up and down the street,
and wriggling his neck as if the cravat
were too tight.
They crossed the street lower down,
and wen.* approaching the entrance to
the place, when Mary saw l'aul and hem
Dodd standing in the doorway. Mary
kept on with increased speed.
She walked for about a square, whis
periug words of cheer at every step, then
turned to try and reach her own room
undetected. She had gone but few
yards when Sunigg ami Cheatham moved
out of the shadows and stood before
them. She tried to shout for help, but
her tongue could not utter a word, nor
her breath form a cry.
A low whistle was heard, and then the
rattle of wheels, as a carriage came from
a neighboring corner.
CHAPTKU XXVl'H.
"Well," said Cheatham. "I've got you
at last. Xow, Miriam, get into that car
riage, and your companion I will send
the police to attend to."
He stepped fonvard to lay his hand ou
Miriam's shoulder, but with a cry of
alarm she fell back and clnug to Mary.
The nervousness and indecision that
rendered Mary speechless for the moment
vanished, and a ficrce reaction Bet in.
With her left arm about Miriam, like a
belt of steel, her right hand was uprais
ed, and dark though it was, Cheatham
and Smugg caught the gleam of the pis
tol and fell back,
"Out of my way." she said, in clear,
cold tones that chilled them, though the
night was warm.
4*I)are
to lay hand
on either of us, and you die!"
"We don't want, to hurt either of you,'*
gasped Cheatham. "Hut am Miss Mi
riam's guardian, and I cannot, in justice
to her, permit her to patrol the streets
with such a character as you/'
"Such a character as 1!*' she exclaim
ed. "Do you dare to utter a word against
me7 Hut yes in a mad, crazed hour 1
married your nephew that one act
should shadow every virtue and dim the
whiteness of an angel's brow. Hut you
take not this child from me. I a*n only
a woman, but. I am a desperate one,
standing at bay before you merciless
bloodhounds. Drive me tun1 more step
and 1 tire!"
"I'll cail the police/' threatened Cheat
ham.
••Call tin* police!" said Mary. "The
law has so far shown It is powerless to
protect. Call the police better the
blackest, dampest cell of a prison than a
palace near you. Call the officers, or
leave my path."
Mary stepped slowly back as she spoke,
her eyes ami attention so lixed on tho
men in front that she di 1 not perceive
that she was walking into the arms of a
policeman.
Smugg and hi:- companions suddenly
disappeared, but Cheatham stood his
ground.
"Hello, here: what's ail this fuss
about':** demanded of||e.*r. lie was
the man who had arrc«tcd Miriam at
the pawnbroker's.
Cheatham recognized him. and calling
him by name, said:
"My ward. Miss Hermann, has run
away from me again, 1 lind her with
this character on the streets, and I am
trying to coax her to come to her com
fortable home."
"It is false," said "Mary, concealing the
weapon held in her right, hand. "1 found
the poor girl drugged in a carriage that
was in charge of one of Cheatham's com
panions. succeeded in getting her out,
and was trying to take her to my home
nosu* by when this monster appeared."
"Do you make a charge. Mr. Cheat*
ham7" a*ked the otlieer.
"I do."
"Against these women?"
"No against the one named Mary.''
"What for7"
"Abduction."
It was near daylight when again they
stood before the sergeant's desk, and
Cheatham made his charge and Mary
answered the customary interrogatories.
"Do you want to go with Mr. Cheat
ham?" asked the sergeant, addressing
Miriam.
"Oh. no, no, no!" she cried. "Kill me
kill me at once, but do not put me in
his power again."
"We have no desire to wrong you, my
child." said the sergeant, his better na
ture touched by her pleading voice and
utter helplessness. "The law aims to
protect, ami so far as I have the power
I shall use it in that way." He turned
to one of the attendants and told him to
(•all the matron.
"You don't mean to say." exclaimed
Cheatham, "that you are going to sep
arate me ami my ward. Miss Hermann?"
"Miss Hermann looks as if death
would soon separate you." replied the
sergeant. "She needs aid, ami I pro
pose that she shall have all this placc
can afiord."
"You are transcending your duty."
"You think so?" sneered the sergeant.
"1 do."
"You have your redress-make com
plaint against inc. But 1 want to tell
you that 1 am not the only person who
has been watching and disapproving of
your recent, conduct. Now, sir. you can
sit hen* till court meets: or. if you would
like to be private. 1 will give you a cell,
with more pleasure than I ever did any
thing in my life."
The matron had made her appearance
by this time, and. recognizing Miriam as
fi'.^^oung lady who hail been recently in
her ZTia.'ve, slit? hastened over and kissed
her.
"Poor child. po«v, "hild!" she said, "and

field amendment: prohibiting the sale of
liquors on military reservations and at
military posts was accepted by a tnajoR
lt of the Republicans of the House as
a direct intimation that the President
wanted the canteen abolished, and conse
quently they voted almost solidly for the
amendment. The bill passed is generally

REPORT OF SECRETARY ROOT,
Wants CO,OOO Men to Speedily Restore
Order in the 1'liilipplncs.
The annual report of Secretary Root,
made public Monday, is interesting, ow
ing to the vast number of subjects con
sidered. He details the trend of events
in the Philippines, Cuba, Porto Rico,
Oliina and Alaska, showing the great ac
tivity of American soldiers in these new
spheres of usefulness.
Especial importance attaches to his reo
ommendations with regard to the Philip
pines. He wants GO,000 soldiers for the
immediate future in the islands, in o^der
that the 400 posts may bo sufUciently gap
risoned. In a few months native soldiera
can be depended upon to police the isl
ands at much less cost, but American sol
diers are needed to stamp out the rebel
lious Tagalogs.
He also recommends the coinage of a
special dollar, of the same weight and
fineness as the Mexican dollar, for use
in the Philippines. This is necessary be
cause of the fluctuating price of Mexi
can dollars. He also suggests thnt an
insular dollar be coined, and which the
United States will undertake to redeem
in gold at 50 cents. The Secretary of the
Treasury inclines to the latter course.
With reference to Cuba, Secretary
Root finds much gratification in the im*
proved conditions. He dwells upon the
eagerness of the natives to gain an edu
cation and fhe facilities that are being
provided the abolition of filthy prisons,
of disease-breeding pens tor the Insane
and helpless invalids, all of which have
been wiped out.
Highly complimentary reference is
made to the work of United States sol
diers and civilians in Porto Rico, China
and Alaska.
The annual report of Attorney General
Griggs is chiefly confined to statistics on
departmental work. The trust issue la
not mentioned. He urges that Congress
Increase the appropriation for a new
building for the department and asks
that the time limit on construction be
widened, owing to the rise in the price of
building material.
MERCIER CRIES WAR.
Tells French 8?nate Invasion of
Ktand Would Be Easy.
Gen. Mercier in the French Senate
Tuesday startled everybody by disclos
ing part of the ,plans he has in mind for
the invasion of Great Britain by a
French army. In fact, Gen. Mercier went
so far and eausdS such a remarkable sen
sation that Pr/esident Fallieres was final
ly obliged to prder him to stop his speech
in dread that he might reveal important
state secrets./
New York—No new features have beev
presented by the business situation this
week. Authorities generally agree that-.
1901 is likely to be one of the most ac-.
tive years in the history of the country.'
In the ^tock market activity and strength
again have been the rule. Such reactions
as have occurred have been inconsequen
tial and the losses in prices quickly re
covered. Except in the case of a few
specialties, there have been no further
large advances, but the whole list lias
continued .to. show a strong tone under
the influence of a steady investment de-..
niand for the standard dividend-paying
stocks. Money rates still favor the bor
rower rather than the lender.
Chicago—On the Board of Trade the
feature of the week was tho progress and
finally the successful termination of the
November deal in corn. Such operations
always cause serious disturbance in the
branch of trade in which they are at
tempted and seldom result favorably to
the managers. The price of November
corn the week before at the close was 45
cents, 51 cents Wednesday," anu Friday
afternoon had dropped to 3D Vi cents.
Shipping of com East was paralyzed at"',
a most critical part of the season of lake
navigation by the unhealthy end altogeth
er artificial advance in the price of the
cereal for immediate delivery, without
any compensating advantage to anyone
but the young speculator who took the
enormous risk entailed by an attempt to
corner the market. Wheat was heavy
and its price suffered a fyrtlier decline,
although there were not wanting some in
dications of a turn in the course of the
features of the situation that have been
Hie cause of the protracted weakness of
the market. The general drift of advices
from Argentina leads to the conclusion
that all is not well with the crop of wheat
that is within a few weeks of its matur-'
ity in that country while deliveries from
farmers at home have been rcducod to a
point not greatly ifi excess of domestic
consumption. Decreases in the visible
supply will soon be of weekly occurrence,
and if the Argentine exportable surplus
does not excce_d the 40,000,000 bushels
claimed for it by conservative people in
the grain trade there, Europe will be
thrown back upon this country for a larg
er proportion of its supplies than it has
quite recently been willing to believe pos-'
tible. Provisions have been affected on
the one hand by the very small stocks of
manufactured products aud on the other
by the heavy receipts of hogs, but for the
present the latter have been the ruling
consideration, as evidenced by a slight
decline in prices of pork, lard and ribs.
RETIRING SENATORS.
There Arc Thirteen Wliosc Terms Ex
pire in March.
At the end of this session1 of Congress
a considerable number of men who have
nchicved more or less distinction in the
Senate will retire. Some "Republicans
will be succeeded Democrats, jjonie
Pe'iiocrets by^Kepublicans, and some of
both'parties |jj- men of their own polit
ical faith. The Senators who will leave,
Washington, retiring to private life, are
Baker of Kansas, Butler of North Car
olina, Caffery of Louisiana, Carter of
Montana, Chilton of Texas, Kenney of
Delaware, Lindsay ot Kentucky, Petti
grew of South Dakota, Shoup of Idaho,
Sullivan of Mississippi, Thurston of Ne
braska, Turley of Tennessee and Wolcott
of Colorado. There are sever*l others
who will be opposed for re-election at
the forthcoming legislative sessions who
may also bo obliged to remove their sen
atorial togas, but whose re-election is
probable. These are Chandler of New
Hampshire, Cullom of Illinois and Nelson
of Minnesota. Bacon of Georgia, Berry
of Arkansas, Elkins of West Virginia,
Frye of Maine, Iloar of Massachusetts,
Dolliver of Iowa, McBride, of Oregon,
McMillan of Michigan, Martin of Vir
ginia, Morgan of Alabama, Sewell of
New Jersey, Tillman of South Carolina,
Warren of Wyoming and Wetmore of
Rhode Island either have been or are.
sure to be re-elected.
Of the retiring members Wolcott of
Colorado and Thurston of Nebraska are"
easily the most distinguished. They have
been counted among the most brilliant
and eloquent members of the upper house
and their retirement is a loss to the Re
publicans. Butler of North Carolina is
the youngest member of the Senate. He
was a Populist leader and has made a
name for himself at Washington as de
bater. Donelson Caffery, the Louisiana
sugar planter, was one
ot

Grover Cleve­
land's most ardent supporters. Shoup of
Idaho is a notable figure from the fact
that, although he has served two terms,
he has done nothing that has made his
name familiar to any except the most
critical students of congressional life.
He Is a Republican, was a stock raiser
and mine owner, and helped establish
Idaho In statehood.
