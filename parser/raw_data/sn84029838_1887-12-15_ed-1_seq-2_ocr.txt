signed is very brief, containing only
about two hundred words, setting forth
that the signers, who chiefly earn their
living by authorship, ask that the
United States shall no longer be the
only civilized Nation to refuse copy
right to foreign authors, thus ruining

elections counted up into the hundreds ol
thousands; the great State of New York,
Pennsylvania and Ohio had Democratic
Governors; New York elected by nearly
200,OCO plurality, which was reduced for the
same candidate iu the Presidential election
to less than 1.100. Though by accident the
Democrats have the Presidency and the
prestige of success, the signs lire aus
picious for tho election or a Republican
President in lfcSS. The momentum acquired
by twenty-live years of the prevalence ol
Republican principles has not yet lost its
force, and the material interests of the
couutry arc still prosperous as the result
of Republican industrial legislation.
The roll was then called and every State
and Territory, with one or two exceptions,
was represented by a delegate or proxv.
A comuuttco of three members of the Re
publican National League appeared, and
through its chairman, J. Halo Sypher, re
newed the invitation tendered by the league
to the committee to hold its meetings at
the league headquarters. The invitation
was unanimously and cordially accepted
and the committee adjourned to reassemble
at the league club house.
The first delegation admitted was that
from Minnesota, a largo number of gentle
men bearing badges indicating that they
were present to advocate the claims ol
Minneapolis, Mr. Windom presenting the
advantages offered by that city.
General J. B. Henderson, of Missouri,
acted as spokesman for a large delegation
of gentlemen who were admitted to present
the advantages of St. Louis as the conven
tion city.
The Missouri delegation having retired,
the committee at 1:30 took a recess for one
hour, and after the recess the Chicago deh-
gation was admitted, and Mayor Roche, ol
Chicago, detailed the conveniences which
could be accorded the members of the con
vention by Chicago iu ca-e that city io
ccived the favorable vote of tho Commit
tee. Senator Mandorson spoke for Omaha
"that young giant of a municipality situ
ated iu the heart of a continent and upon
tiio banks of tho greatest river in tho
world."
A dispatch was received and read by tho
secretary from Mayor Francis, of St.
Louis, offering the committee in behalf of
the citizens or that city, every facility and
convenience for holding the convention.
Tho delegation from Ohio w.s then ad
mitted and Congressman Ben Butterworth
presented the claims of Cincinnati as a I
place peculiarly suited for holding tho next
Natioual Republican convention.
Congressman Harry Bingham, in an elo
quent speech, presented the claim of Phil
adelphia, and Colonel William C. Elam, of
Richmond, Va., presented an argument in
favor of tho Republican party of that
Stite.
Ex-Governor Gillette, of Dakota, pre
sented the claims of tho people of that
Territory to the recognition of tho Re
publican National Committee.
The formal papers presenting the claims
of Chicago, Minneapolis and Omaha were
then submitted, and it was moved that the
committee proceed to an informal ballot.
An amendment wus offered that the vote
be viva voce instead of by ballot, and this
was adopted 30 to 17.
The committee then proceeded to take
the formal vote viva voce. It resulted as
follows: Chicago, 11; Omaha, 10; Cincin
nati, 7; iVinneapols, ti; Puiladclphia, 'J; St.
Lnuis, 2; Washington, 1.
The committee then proceeded to vote
formally by ballot, each State or Terri
torial representative stepping up to tho
chairman's table as the State and Territory
I was called and depos.ting hi vote in a hat.
j The baliots were counted by two tellers
(Haynes. of Maine, and Longer, of Ohio.)
and the result was afterward announced as
follows: Whole number of ballots cast, 47;
necessary to a choice, -4, of which Chi
cago received 22, Omaha 4, Cincinnati 'J,
Minneapolis 8, Philadelphia 3 and St.
Louis 1.
The second formal ballot was then taken
and tcsuited as follows: Whole number of
ballots cast, 47; necessary to a choice, 24,
of which Chicago rece.ved 2o, Omaha 1,
Cincinnati 13, Minneapolis 8.
On motiou of Mr. Rollins, of New Hamp
shire, the time for the meeting was fixed
for Tuesday. June l'J, 1SS3.
Mr. Littler, of Illinois, moved that the
chairman and secretary ol the cotumitti o
be instructed to prepare and publish a call
for the National convention. It was agreed
t.
On motion or Mr. Conger, of Ohio, tho
hearty and full co-operation of the commit;
tee was voted lo the men represented by
Mr. Gallagher, and at 7:3J the committco
finally s.djourued.
There was no uuuui. u good reason for
the practice of the Hebrews to raid and to
write from right to loft. We have often
speculate I und inquired about it, and
while we could not learn any thing very
tangible m regard to it, wo aro quite con
vinced that the most pertinent reason lies
in the fact that our vision from right to left
is much clearer and stronger than it is
from left to right. Naturally, so we are
informed, there is no difference in nerves
or in the optic arrangement of the human
eye between the right or the left eye, yet
our own inquiries and observations show
clearly that we are all, or most alL dis
posed, when we take an article of mer
chandise or a picture or any thing else for
examination into our bands, to look at
it from right to left, and not from left
to right. Since we bave endeavored to
fathom this question, we can see quite an
advantage to the eye by reading from right
to left. If we read from left to right the
parts read are yet continually before us;
while, if reading from right to left, the
Part read are then beyond oar sight, and
the parts to be read are unobstructed in
view. Now, when we write from left to
right the line we are writing is rather of
a delusion to tbe eye, while if we write
from right to left nothing is immediately
in front of our vision but a clear space.
Our observation shows that unaware, peo
ple use their eyes from right to left
whenever and wherever they go into
close examination of any thing. Hcbrtw

are reserved by the latter
contracts between
zen. certain rights
which are guaranteed by the constitutional
provisions for the protection ot life, liberty and
property against deprivation without due pro-
cess of law and with which the State can not
interfere; that among those rights is that ol
manufacturing for one's own use of either food
or drink; that, while according to the doctrines
of the commune, the State may control the
tastes, appetites, habits, dress, food and drink
of the citizen, our system of Government,
based upon the individuality and intelligence
of the people, does not claim to control hnn ex- j
cept as to his conduct to others, leaving him the
sole judge a's to all that only s-ffects himself.
It will be observed that the proposition and
the argument made in support of it equally
concede that the right to manufactue drink
for one's personal use is subject to the condi
tion that such manufacture does not endan
ger or affect the riphts or others. If such
manufacture docs prejudicially affect the
rights and interests of tho community, it fol
lows from the very premises stated bj coun
sel that society has the power to protect
itself by legislation against the injurious con
sequences of that business.
But by whom or by what authority is it to be
determined whether the manufa-jture of panic-
uiar articles or unnic, either for general use ot j tfUns tsin not bc md Tor fortifications, ap
for the personal use of the maker, will injurious-' n..onH..tintlR ...... i, mndn for rim tiiiridnwe'
ly affect the public. Power to determine s.ucn
questions, so as to bind all, must exist some
where, else society will be at the mercy of the
few who, regarding only their own appe
tites or passions, may be willing tc
imperil the peace and security of the
many, provided they are permitted
to do as they please. Under our system that
power is lodged with the legislative branches
of the Government. It belongs to that depart
ment to exert what are known as the police
powers of the State. It must determine prim
arily what measures are appropriate and need
ful for th protection of the public morals, the
public health or the public safety.
As the courts must obey the Constitution
rather than the law-making department of Gov
ernment, it must, upon its responsibility, de
termine whether in any particular case these
limits have been passe '. The courts are not
bound by mere forms, nor are they to be misled
by mere pretenses. They are at liberty in
deed, arc under a solemn duty to look at the
substance of things whenever they enter upon
the inquiry whether the Legislature has trans
cended the limits of its authority. If, there
fore, a statute purporting to have been enacted
to protect the public health, the public morals
or the public safety, has no- real or substantial
relation to those objects, or is a pahable inva
sion of rights secured by the fundamental law,
it is the duty of the courts to so adjudge, and
thereby give effect to the Constitution.
Keeping- in v.cw these principles. a povcrn
ing the relations with each other of the judicial
and legislative departments of the Government,
it is difficult to perceive any ground for the ju
diciary to declare that the prohibition by Kan
sas of the manufacture or sale within her limits
of intoxicating liquors for general use there as
a beverage is not fairly adapted to the end ol
protecting the community against the evils
which confessedly result from the excessive
use of ardent spirits. There is here no justifi
cation for holding that the State, under the
guise merely of police regulations, is aiming to
deprive the citizen of his constitutional rights.
If, therefore, a State deems the absolute pro
hibition of the manufacture and sale within her
i limits of intoxicating liquors for other than
medical, scientitic and mannfacturing purposes,
to be necessary to the peace and security of so
ciety, the courts can not, without usurping leg
islative functions, override the will of the pc
ple as thus expressed by their chosen repre
sentatives. It is a fundamental principle in out
institutions, indispensable to the preservation
of public liberty, that one of the separate de
partments of Government shall not usurp pow
ers committed by the Constitution to anothct
department.
With reference to the assertion that the pro
hibition of the manufacture and sale of liquor
deprives liquor dealers of their property with
out due procesa of law, the court says that all
property under the American form of govern
ment is subject to the obligation that it shall be
used so as not to Injuriously affect the rights of
the community and thereby become a nuisance.
The State of Kansas had a right to prohibit the
liquor traffic. It did not thereby take away the
property of the brewers. It simply abated
a nuisance.
For the reason stated, says Justice Harlan,
we arc of opinion that Mugler, the plaintiff
in error, has not been denied by the judg
ment of the Supreme Court of Kansas any
right, privilege or immunity secured to him
by the Constitution of the United States, and
its judgment in each case is accordingly af
firmed. We are also of opinion that the Cir
cuit Court or the United Sta'cs erred in dis
missing the bill, the bill of the State in her
suit against Ziebold and Hagelin. The decree
in that case is reversed and the cause remand
ed, with directions to enter a decree granting to
the State such relief as the act of March 7, 188 ,
authorizes.
Justice Field concurred in the opinion as
it related to the two cases in which the
State of Kansas was defendant, but dis
sented as to the case of the State of Kansas
agaiust Ziebold. He agreed, be said, to so
much of the opinion us sustained the va
lidity of the act of Kansas prohibiting the
sale of intoxicants which were manufact
ured m the State after the passage of the
act. He was not prepared, however, to say
that the prohibition of the manufacture of
such liquors, if intendei for exportation,
could be sustained, nor that the State could
forbid the sale under regulations for the
protection of health and morals of the peo
ple of anyarticlewhich Congress mightau
thorize to be imported. He was not ready to
admit that New York or any other Coast
State could defeat an act of Congress. Nei
ther could he concur in the validity of the
13th section of the Prohibition act
of Kansas because ho believed it
authorized the destruction of property
without due process ot law. He could not
tee upon what principle tbe Legislature
after closing the brewery could order the
destruction of liquor which it admitted
might be valuable for medicinal or mechan
ical purposes. Nor could he see why the
protection of tbe morals of the State re
quired the destruction of bottles and other
utensils after the liquor cad been emptied
from them.

on the garbage they found in ash barrels,
died to-day of poisoning, the history of
which is curious. On yesterday Guisseppe
found in an ash barrel some white, pasty

took it home. This morning his wife made
griddle cakes out rf it, and they ate them
for breakfast Not long after they were

Washington, Dec. 7. Tho annual report,
of tho Secretary of War, transmitted to
Congress yesterday, shows that tho ex

value. Some of them are mounted on old
carriages and arc without ud equate protec
tion. The Secretary refers to General
Schoticld's lccommendation that at least
oue eight-inch muzzle-loading gun, with ap
pliances lor target practice, one or more of
; '"8 new breech-loadmg guns and mortars
j be furnished to each artillery post with a
view to improvement of the artillery in
struction. He says, however, that
tho department is unable to
comply with the request, as there arc no
guns suitable for 3iich large practice and
technical instruction. Tins division is gar
risoned maiuly by artillery, four-fifths f
the oflicers und men of that arm being sta
tioned within its limits. In no branch of
theseivii-o is technical instruction and.
daily experiments and practice iu the use
of its weapons more demanded than in the
artiileri". It is earnestly hoped that if the
propn
or manufacture of enough gnus to employ
the artiileri and fit them for auy ciner
gency. In the division of the Missouri, during the
past year, says the report, it has been ne
cessary to patrol the Oldalioma country in
the Indian Territory, to keep out intruders,,
and to protect tho Indian reservations. A
considerable body of troops have been con
stantly engaged in this duty and there have
been no serious disturbances.
The Secretary strongly approves of the
rccommendatiou contained in General
Sheridan's report touching the extension ol
all possible aid b'the General Governments
to the National Guard of the different
States und suggesting a system of National
encampments for State militia at the entire
expense of the National Government.
Atteutioti is called to the fact that tho
Pacific coast is destitute ot fortiiicalioiis,
guns and armaments of every description,
while San Francisco is without a single
gun which can be tired with safety with
present charges of powder and modern
projectiles.
Favorable indorsement i3also given tc
the L ieutcnnnt-Gcneral's recommendation
that the strength of the army bo increased
by5.0O0 men, and particular attention is
culled to the importance of an increase of
the artillery arm of the service and certain
changes In the present organization of ar
tillery regiments.
The Secretary suggests that tho number
of court martial trials can bc much reduced
if provision be made for the punishment of
minor offenses without summoning a court
martial, as indicated in the annual report of
1SSG. Little is said on the subject of river and
harbor improvements, beyond the state
ment that the report of tho Chief of En
gineers acts forth the condition of each im
provement and the amount of work per
formed during the last fiscal year. Owing
to the failure of the last River and Harboi
Appropriation bill there has been no money
available for the ascertainment of the
depth of water and width of channel at the
South Pass of the Mississippi river, and an
appropriation for the necessary surveys is
urgently recommended.
In concluding his report the Secretary
says: '-The result of tho examinations
for promotion under the Civil-Service reg
ulations, which were applied to the War
Department in May, wore sat'sfactory.
The total number of clerks examined was
1,014, or whom MVJ, or 03 per cent. passeJ.
and of this number 353 or 3.1 percent. ot

fifty-one or five per cent, failed to pass, then

Washington, Dec. 7. The annual report
of Attorney-General Garland was trans
mitted to Congress yesterday. It gives a
full account of the business of the Depart
ment of Justice during the last fiscal year,
together with statistic of crime against
the United States. The number of ordi
nary suits now pending in the court of
claims is 1,110, involving the sum of $13,
250,(XW. The number of cases filed under
the Bowman act is 1.S19, involving about
550,000,000. The petitions filed in French
spoliation cases number 5,56). representing
2,336 vessels and about $30,000,000. The
amrmt reported in favor of claimants in
lbSl of these cases passed upon is about
?4725,000, varying in sums from IGtt tc
(45,318.
The Attorney-General urges a reorgani.
zatiou of the Department of Justice in ac
cordance with the increased amount and
important charecter of its business, and in
closing his report devotes a chapter to the
consideration cf the French Spoliation act,
which, he says, requires further legisla
tion to enable test cases to bc appealed tc
the Supreme Court, which, at piesent, can
not be done.
Kant St. LouU Itoud Cases.
Belleville, 111., Dec. 7. Judge Snyder
rendered a decision yesterday in the East
St. Louis bond cases. Mr. Gundlocb
brought mandamus proceedings to com
pel the levy of a tax to pay a bond
for $1,000 issued by the city and held by
him. The case was fought on the ground,
that the city by its charter could not levy
u tax greater than 10 par cent, of the as
sessed value of its property and that the
limit was already reached. Judge Snyder -decided
against the city in order that the
case might be appealed. However, he
thought the city could net bo compelied to
levy tbe tax in defiance of its charter..
Bonds to the amount of 7jO,000 are in;
