Friday Morning, December 7, 1917.
Bisbee disproved that time-worn statement that a po
phet is without' honor in his own country when she
honored Sheriff Wheeler Wednesday night.
General Von Lndendorff of the German staff is quoted
as declaring that "the war will not end in a draw." He
must have had advance information upon President Wil
son's message-, read Tuesday in congress.
- Ney asked Napoleon for infantry at a critical period
of the battle of Waterloo. "Infantry," replied the greatest
captain of all wars, "do-s the man suppose I can make
infantry? But the Germans seem to be able to make in
fantry. In the face of three years of the most stupendous
losses they are able to hold their long front secure and
then mass troops and guns at Cambrai in overwhelming
numbers. Either General Byng will have to hitch up his
trousers and. tighten his belt and spit on his hands and
cut loose with all his steam, or the intense Bisbee rooter
for the allied cause will -spend an unhappy Christmas.
After sfx carloads of perfectely good potatoes had
stood for a week on a sidetrack in Cleveland the city
seized them and sold them at ninety-five cents per bushel.
How much grain and vegetables and fruit have been at- j
lowed to rot jn warehouses and ships and cars during
the past two years of high prices, only the Lord knows.
Those individuals and companies that buy food in such
vast quantities that they cannot properly handle and dis
pose of it while it is still in good condition, ought to be
sent to jail without bond and then tried before a jury
of wage earners who are paying triple prices for the
necessities of life.
The Halifax disaster emphasizes the constant nienacf
of transportation during the war. Ships and tars loaded
to capacity with high explosives are moving in a ftream
day and night under hurry np orders. That there are not
more accidents of thrs.kind is the wonder of it all. Trans
portation of troops and explosives to and from all parts
of the world during the past three years, with the U-boats
doing their worst, has been attended with remarkably
small loss of life and property when the hazard is con
sidered. All docks and harbors are crowded and all en
trances are mined. These times are about as perilous
as those seen in the vision of John at Patmos, when the
angel opened the seven vials of wrath upon the world.
Reports from the Cambrai sector continue to get
worse and worse. The London offioe practically admits
that it cannot hold the Germans back. This is the most
disconcerting news of the war. If the British war ma
chine that was good enouih to smash the Hindenburg line
. and hold all gains through two summers, has now gone
to smash, then the worst is yet to come. The allies have
a vast superiorty of men and guns on the western front
or did have them. Why they cannot hold the ground won
and foi-e the fighting in the open to advantage by a
much greater concentration at this point than the Huns
is past the comprehension of tliif amateur war critic to
fathom. Not for two years have the Germans showed
uch hitting power as they have in the past few weeks
in Italy and at Cambrai. The oft spoken of German
morale seems to have gotten its second wind.
Any Bisbee citizen who is inrlined to kick upon the
pri'e of twenty dollars a ton for coal, might read the fol
lowing from the Washington, D. ('., Times, and then
wonder if this district is getting very much the worst
of it after all: "It took more than twenty dollars and a
pleading voice to buy a ton of coal in Wa&liington yester
day. This was proven by a deputation of Times reporters,
caeli armed with a twenty-dollar gold piece and an im
pending chill and each instructed to use every kind of a
plea he could think of to get one tou of coal delivered
at his home. One hundred and one coal dealers were
isited and as a last resort every government official
having anything to do with the fuel question was appealed
to. The result bummed up is I hat there were several
oc.iers who said that possibly Uiey might deliver a tots
some time not week, but would make no promises:
from all the rest the answer was, "Sorry, but can't bell
you a ton today." "
HERTLING'S CHALLENGE.
(Kansas City Star.)
There Is a challenge to the allies as well as to the
German people in Chancellor Von Hertling's review of the
war. He points to the Cerman military successes and
virtually admonishes the central powers to hold on un
til the war map can be converted into the peace map.
A comparison of German and allied resources shows
that a time must come wnen Germany's strength will be
waning while that of the allies will still be climbing.
There are indications that that time Is neat, if not al
ready arrived. If in three years of effort, in which her
maximum strength has been used, Germany has not been
able to cash in, what chance will she have to do it when
her strength begins to decline?
Under these cireimstnnces, if Germany had the nerve
to hold out while the allies' nerve failed, and they were
ready to accept a Lansdowne peace, then Germany would
deserve to win and impose her rule on the rest of the
world.
The wheatless day has been changed from Friday to

JAMES DOUGLAS WRITES
ABOUT CONDITIONS IN

DUAL MONARCHY IS
READY FOR HONORABLE
PEACE; RULER SAYS
S. P. Applewhite of Douglas has re
ceived a letter from James S. Douglas,
who is now in France, engaged in Red
Cross work and other war activities,
which gives an idea of the pi'jblems
with which Mr. Douglas is confronted.
Following are some excerpts from the
letter:
"We get very lit.Ie news here. I

who is a colonel in the British

I have also met and spent some time

with scorn and he viewed with Berserk rage. He argued,
pleaded, cajoled, threatened, exposed and exclaimed. He
fought to the last ditch against the bonds, and kept on
fighting. The bonds carried, it is true, and by an over
whelming majority. But in Bowie, the home of this edi

It i impossible to conceive the amount of work that is
being done in this country to win the war. Here ?s a
little clift in the mountains,' that torty years ago was in

hundreds of young men have gone from hero to encamp
ments to train for the wai game. Scores of young men
enlisted from here beforj the draft to fight in the engin
eers, the artillery, the signal corps and the marines.
Business men have gone from here to France to aid in
Red Cross work. Our county officials are most of them
spending as much time on war work as county work. Our
women, young and old, are working every day for a dozen
war funds and benefactions. We have given millions
to carry on the war. This all seems a great deal. But
consider that every community in the republic is doing
the same thing. The aid and rich cities back cast have
thousands engaged iu this work where we have scores.
