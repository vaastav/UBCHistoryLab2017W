WILSON'S MESSAGE TO CONGRESS
COVERS RADICALISM, COSTS OF
HYING AND LABOR CONDITIONS
Also Recommends That Country Adopt Budget System, Reorgani­
zation of Taxation System, Readjustment of Tariff, Aid for
Soldiers, and Urges Adoption of Peace Treaty as Cure for
Washington, Dec. 2.—General recommendation on legislation
to combat the cost of living, labor unrest, radicalism and a read­
justment of the nation to a peace time basis wer^ the features of
President Wilson's annual message to congress delivered today.
The peace treaty, the President told congress, will be discussed
in a separate message later as will the railroad question.
For the second t\me only since the President established the
practice of addressing congress in person his message was read
today by tjie clerk.
Extend Food Control Law
Several recommendations some re­
newals of previous ones were made
by the president to bring down the
cost of living. Among them were ex­
tension of the food control law tc
peace times for the emergency regu­
lation for transportation of food in
interstate commerce a cold storage
law modelled after the law in New
Jersey a law requiring marks to
show the length of time foods are
kept in storage and a law to "secure,
competitive selling and prevent un­
conscionable profits" "uy federal li­
cense o£ corporations selling food in
interstate commerce."
Rights of 'Labor
A long portion of the message was
devoted to a discussion of the condi­
tions and rights of lafior. "A definite
program to bring aiout an improve­
ment in tho conditions of labor" and
bring about a genuine democratization
of industry was recommended.
"The only way to keep men from
agitating against grievances is to re­
move the grievances" said the pres­
ident's message. At another point it
declared "the speed of revolution is
repression."
"Tho establishment of the princi­
pals regarding labor laid down in the
covenant of the league of nations."
said the message "offers us the. way
to, industrial peace and conciliation.
•No other road lies open to us."
Refers to Federal Injunction
"The right of individuals to strike
Is iaviolent" continued the message,
"and ought not to be Interferred with
by any process of government but
there is a predominant right' and that
is the right of the government to pro­
tect all of its people ana to assert its
power and majetay against the chal
lenge of any class."
The president was referring to- the
government's recent injunction
against the coal strike.
Russia is Object Lesson' -v
The message closed with a pointed
reference to radicalism and red doc­
trines and referred to "Russia today
with its blood. and terror" as a "pain­
ful object lesson of the power of mi­
norities."
Orderly processes the message de­
clared were the only ones by which
relief and reforms could' be obtained.
Hints at Townleyism
"Those who would propose any oth­
er methods of reform are enemies of
this country," the message said. "Let
those beware who take the shorter
road of disorder and revolution.'
PRINCIPLE REQQMMfaN'DATlOXS
The president's principle recommeu
dations were:
Establishment of a budget system
for the national finances.
Reorganization of the taxation sys­
tem with simplification of the income
and excess profits tax laws.
Readjustment of the tariff system
if necessary to meet the changed world
condition and make the system con­
form with the fact that the Unlit"t
States is "the greatest capitalist in the
world."
AID FOR SOLDIERS
Recognition and relief for vetennj
soldiers of the world war particular
in the way of government farms fes
proposed T)y Secretary Lane.
Proper measures to foster the dye
stuft-industry built up during the war
to keep the United States independent
of foreign supply.
An enlarged program for world de­
velopment in recognition of the farm­
ers' part in the war.
Measures whicli "will remove the
causes" of "political restlessness in
our body politic."
TEACE TREATY IS CURE
At this point the president made his
most extensive reference to the peace
treaty by saying the"causing for ,th°
unrest are "superficial rather than
deep-seated" and that-they "arise from
or are connected with tho failure or.
the part of our government to arrive
speedily at a just and permanent
jeace permitting return to normal con­
ditions, from the transfusion of radl
al theories from resting Europear
renters, pending such delay from
heartless profiteering resulting from
the increase of the cost of living an«V
lastly from the machinations of pas­
sionate and malevolent agitators
With the return to normal condition
this unrest will rapidly disappear."
The president renewed his recom­
mendation for legislation to deal effec­
tively with 'those persons who fcy vio­
lent methods would abrogate our time
tested institutions.?' V.

PASTOR UPHOLDS
FREE LOVE BOOK
Rev. John Flint Approves
Ellen Key's Works
of
"Particularly Ellen Key!''
This was the reply of Rer. John
Flint, pastor of Trinity Lutheran
church of Bismarck today, when
asked by a reporter if it were
true that he went before the
league caucus last night to de­
fend the presence of treatises on
socialism, anarchism and free
lore in the North Dakota public
library, which is controlled by
Governor Frarier's state board of
regents.
"I told the league caucus that
these books should be in the state
library," said Mr. Flint thte morn­
ing, "but that/they should hot be
sent out promiscuously—only as
called for."
"And do you think that Ellen
Key's works should be in the
North Dakota public library?" he
was asked.
"Decidedly Ellen Key—particu­
larly EJIen Key!" emphatically
replied Mr. Flint, who was inter­
viewed in the presence of Rev. E.
F. A If sen of the Swedish Luther­
an church.
Flint appeared before the league
caucus last night in voluntary de­
fense of volumes which Rep. 0.
B. Burtnss of Grand Forks during
the afternoon session of the house
had branded as un-American, un­
christian, immoral and indecent,
and not fit reading for the youth
of 'North Dakota or. for any loyal
American. /Flint told the leag­
uers in secret caucus that he had
these books in his own libraty
that he" approved of them, and
that he believed they should be in
public as well as private libraries.
AMERICAN PEACE
DELEGATION MAY
REMAM PARIS
Postpone Sailing to This Country
Because of Germany's
Refusal
Paris. Dec. 2.—The American dele­
gation to the peace conference which
was to have sailed from Brest for the
United States on December 0 has post­
poned its departure, for home it
learned today.
A considerable part of the personnel
of the delegation, however, will leave
Paris for Brest on the eevning of De­
cember 5 as previously arranged.
It is learned that from a high au­
thority that the change in the plans of
the,delegation is due to the failure of
the Germans to sign the prqtocol rati­
fying the peace treaty.
Norway Suffering
From Competition
WitlTHun Articles
Reports State That German In­
dustries, Are Growing
Rapidly
Christina, Dec. 2.-—(By the Asso­
ciated Press.)—Morway is beginning
to suffer from Gorman competition,
say leading Norwegian business men.
Prices for machinery and steel con­
struction arc said to be 60 per cent
cheaper in Germany than in Norway.
The finished product imported from
Germany costs only about as much
as the raw or unfinished producct
would cost in (Norway.
Reports from Germany say that
Industry there is growing rapidly.
The low rate of German exchange,
it. is pointed out, makes Germany's
competition in foreign markets much
keener.
•Norwegian clectrical power plants
now under construction are buying
their turbines In Germany because
they are so much cheaper there that
they cannot afford to buy them at
home.
It is claimed that at present Ger­
many is able to heat' any competition
here on the products for which she,
herself, can furnish raw' materials.
Lack of shipping facilities is said to
be the only thing that prevents Ger­
many from dumping her products
on Scandinavian countries at prices
so low as to, kill all competition.
Leading N-ftrwegian businessmen
have been made rather pessimistic
by this condition. v?

/.
Clay
New York, Dec. 2.—Henry
Frick died here today.
Mr. Frick suffered an attack of
ptomaine poisoning early in Novem­
ber. lie had nearly recovered from
this when complications developed
He was GO years old.
BORN ON FARM
The career of Henry Clay Frick has
formed one of the most fascinating
chapters in the romance of industry in
(he United States. At, ten, a boy on a
farm in a family of only, ordinary
means, ho was. at sixty, man of so
ninny millions that his fortune, like
those of Carnegie and Rockefeller, was
largely a mnlter of guess-work even to
himself. It has been said lie wa
worth more than $100,000,000, perhaps
as much as $200,000,000.
Mr. Frick built up the greatest coke
business in the world, and acquired
such vast interests in steel that he was
also one of the principal roganates in
that iiidustry, and in rounding out his
career he became known as one of the
world's greatest, collectors of master
paintings.
ALMOST ASSASSINATED
Through tho Homestead strike of
1 S!V_\ Mr. Frick came into national
prominence. Differences -had arisen
between the Carnegie Steel Company
and its employes over wage seal/',
culminating in a strike involving
thousands of men the calling out of
the National Guard aJid the proclama­
tion of nvirtial law. It was at this
period, .luly, 22, 1892 that Alexander
Berkman. a New York anarchist, tried
to assassinate Mr. Frick. Berkman
warked into Frick's ofllce, drew a. re­
volver and fired, tho bullet lod-ging in
l\fr. Frlck's neck. Mr. Frick was shot, a
Barkman. During the enconnted Mr.
Berkman. During the encounter iMr.
Friclc was stanbed three times, but he
downed his assailant and held him un­
til the police arrived. Berkman was
tried and sent to the Western penlfcen
llnry in Pittsburgh for twenty-one
years.
Thirteen days after the attack Mr
Frick walked to his office unattended
nnd resumed t.he direction of the grear
strike which continued until November
21 of that year. Mr. Frick was un­
moved by the violence, the protests of
the public or the distress of the fami­
lies of the strikers. He won and never
begrudged the price of victory.
RIVAL OF CARNEGIE
In 1003 times became hard and
United States Steel dropped to a low
level. Mr. Frick then bought every­
thing he could in the way of steel
stock and when the excitement wa
over it was found he had acquired
enough to be a power in that concern.
His first move was to dethrone Mr.
Schwab as President, but W. E. Corey,
another Carnegie man. succeeded
Schwab. Then Mr. Frick attacked
Corey and succeeded in having him re­
moved. a Mr. Farrel'l, Frick's friend,
was finally made President of the
great corporation.
The breach between Mr. Frick- ami
Mr. Carnegie never fully healed. A
small instance of it was seen in Pitts­
burgh, where Mr. Carnegie \huilt
large office building, naming it after
himself, next door to which Mr". Frick
built another building twice as large
and named it after himself. Mr. Fricn.,
incidentally, became one of the largest
holders of real estate in Pittsburgh
In New York Mr. Cam lege built a
magnificent, home and some time later
Mr. Frick built an even more palatini'
residence, on the ,site of the old Lenox
Library between 70th and 71st streets
on Fifth avenue. It was here that lie
provided for a.picture gallery which is
one of the largest if not the largest',
private gallery in the world. It con­
tains some of the most valuable and
famous paintings by Velasquez. Rani
brandt, Gainsborough and other mas­
ters. Many of these canvasses are
sn Id to have cost Mr. Flick several
hundred thousand dollars each
On December 15. 1SSI, Mr. Frick
was married to Miss Ada noward
Childs of Pittsburgh, l^our children
were born to them two boys and two
girls. Mrs. Frick, one son and one
daughter survive.

COMMITTEE FINDS CHARGES BADE
BY BURTNESS SUBSTANTIATED BY
CONTENTS OF STATE'S LIBRARIES
New Librarian Admits Having Ordered Works on Socialism, An­
archism and Free Love—Displayed Them Prominently Because
She Thought Legislators Would Be Interested—Recent Invoice
Shows Trend of Literary Taste in Board of Administration
GALLERIES CROWDED TOMORROW
The house "free love" investigation committee which was
named to inspect the books in the state library and determine
their fitness for public consumption will report Wednesday af­
ternoon at 5 o'clock. Inasmuch as the books under surveil­
lance are reputed to be full of weird philosophy on the desir­
ability and advantages of free love and it is expected that the
house galleries will be thronged with spectators interested in
the subject to hear the committee's report.
CANNOT DEFEND FREE LOVE
Declaring that he could not go to the people of North Dakota
and defend the action of the state board of administration in mak­
ing available to the youth of the state Ellen Key's glorification of
free love and similar works which are now in the public library,
Governor Frazier is said to have served notice on the state board
of administration last night that the library situation must be
cleared up at once.
George A. Totten, formerly a Congregational preacher, is said
to have promptly assumed responsibility for the anarchistic, so­
cialistic, free loving complexion of the state library, and to have
declared that the books were ordered with his consent and sanc­
tion and that they would remain in the state library so long as he
was chairman of the state board of administration.
This afternoon the state board is to meet with the legislative
invesigating committee to explain the presence of,the books on
socialism, free love and anarchy in the public library. An effort
will be made to have this joint meeting public. Miss Minnie J.
Nielson, although a member of the state board of administration
by virtue of her position as state superintendent of public instruc­
tion, has at no time been called into consultation' upon this mat­
ter, it is said, and it is not known whether she will be allowed to
vote this afternoon upon the question upon which the board has
divided.
Incensed over the revelations made in the house by Represen­
tative Burtness on Monday afternoon, Governor Frazier is said to
have demanded from the state board of administration last night
the resignation of Dr. C. E. Stangeland, in charge of the state li­
brary and held responsible for the presence there of volumes advo­
cating socialism, anarchy and free love.
Chairman Totten and Robert Muir are said to be standing for
Stangeland, Totten being reported to have said that if his appoin­
tee goes he will go also. Patrick M. Casey.and Commissioner John
N. Hagen arc said to be siding with the governor in his demand
that Stangeland must go. Miss Minnie J. Nielson, state superin­
tendent of public instruction and the fifth member of the boardjof.
administration, has not yet been called into the conferehce.
The house committee investigating Representative 0. B. Burt­
ness' charges that the public library commission, dominated by the
state board of administration, has prepared for distribution
through circulating libraries destined for the use of country
schools treatises advocating free love, socialism and anarchism,
met following a visit to the public library commission's office and
an interview with the deputy librarian last evening and agreed
upon the following points:
1. That all the books whose titles were read in the house
by Rep. Burtness were actually in the library.
2. That practically all of the books known were found to be
in the traveling libraries, designed for use in the rural schools.
3. That the deputy librarian defended the presence of these
volumes in the library, declaring them to be by reputable authors
and to be good material for the traveling libraries which furnish
the rural school children of. the state with their reference works.
On point four, submitted for agreemnt by Rep. J. F. O'Connor
of Grand Forks, a former member of the committee, there was a
warm argument* Mr. O'Connor submitted the fact that the books
found in the list read by Rep. Burtness were found in the traveling
library box No. 107, or on top of the same.
In this juncture the majority
members of the committee blew
up. They insisted that this pro­
position created an inference
that these books "were actually
being sent out to the schools."
Rep. O'Connor replied: "What
we're interested in, gentlemen, is
facts, not inferences. Here are
the facts: Traveling Library
Box No. 107, the books in that
box and on top of the1 box you
can read the titles for your­
selves. These are the facts, gen­
tlemen and that is all the house
of representatives asks of this
committee."
The committee met early this
afternoon to decide upon its full
report to the house. It is not be­
lieved there will be any neces­
sity for a division as to the facts,
which minority members declare
clear and incontrovertible.
Representatives Walker, Burkhardt
ana Johnson of Steele, leaguers, an

Laughlin. independents, will investl-

which created a sensation in the house
yesterday, that tlje state board of ad
ministration, which has control of the
public schools, is teaching free love
and socialism in the rural schoois
through the medium of circulating li­
braries which Burtness declared were
stocked by C. F. Stangeland, a former
attache of the American consular serv­
ice, with works of uotorious writers
on socialism and anarchy. This com­
mittee was named by the speaker of
the house upon motion of Representa­
tive O'Connor, and it began its investi­
gation last night In tho meantime
the house has deferred action upon the
report of the judiciary committee rec­
ommending that House Bill 28, repeat­
ing the board of administration act

schools to the state superintending,
and creating a board of supervisors
to manage the higher institutions of

tional institutions be indefinitely post­

onposition to the committee report and
his disclosures relating to the alleged

reading matter which is being furn­
ished by the board of administration
for the country schools created a sen­
sation. For the most part the league
members sat silent when he had clos­
ed. but there was liberal applause
from the independents and the specta­
tors' gallery. There was a spontan­
eous outburst when Walter MaddocJc
of Mountrail, a young leaguer who has
been a leader in the house for four
sessions, declared "there was enough
real red-blood Americanism ant
Christian manhood in the house to
protect the schools and the homes from
this sort of socialist rubbish and free
love rot if we have to repeal the board
of administration act and every other
law on our statute-books."
OTHER WORK'S PURCHASED
In addition to the works quoted by
Burtness, which were exclusively of a
socialistic nature, and which he declar.
ed made up the entire contents of cir­
culating library boxes which he ha«I
inspected in the state library, there
were placed on the members' desks
during the afternoon copies of an in­
voice made last week by Secretary
