Virginia and Secession.
I have read extracts from a recent letter
of R. E. Scott, esq , of Virginia, in which
while he deprecates Secession as a remedy,
he expresses in effect a desire that the whole
Sjuth may be united in their course, if sev
eral of tho States determine to seccde. j
I have a high respect for the opinious of
Ttfr. Scott; but in this case the issue is too
momentous to justify the acceptance of any
opinions without a fa1!understanding of the
reasons upon which they are founded. May
1 not then, as a Virginian, and one deeply
interested in her welfare, inquire of Mr.
Scott, or any one competent to respond to
the great question, ichy "united ' action, in
th0 present Secession movements, is desira
ble "lor Virginia? If tho Cotton States de
?Aa t0 <r0, would the remaining Southern
States be really "powerless" and "defence
i,,?? jn the present Union?and is it mani
festlv the course oi wisdom in irgmia to
^Virginia is an Agricultural State. Ere
lon-r she may be largely interested ia manu
factures. And if the waole bouth secede,
we should very soon have Virginia Mary
land Kentucky, Tennessee, and Missouri,
n engaged in the same pursuits?rwal-s m
Southern Confi'tleracy. Now, where
should wo find a market? N on-intercourse
Wuuld be the role between us and the ^orth
and West, at least for years to come.?
Could the remaining Soutnern Mates con
sume our surplus grain, cattle pork, and
manufactures? No one. 1 think, can show
that this could be expected, borne will say
we can send these things abroad, and have j
'roe trade with the world . But we have
neither ships, nor money to buy them nor |
materials to build them. Freight might be ,
hired- but only at crushing rates, lu Agri
cultural products we should encounter as
rivals the great West and Northwest, tana
do and the countries of the Mediterranean
aud Baltic. In manufactures we should
have to contend with both Old ana New
England, in whose present superior facili
ties'and skill we should find great obstacles
to success, free trade would toreed,
upon us; and however wo may admire that
idea no\c, a tarift' will then prove our great
est need. Still the South would not con
?COur State debt is another serious difficul
ty Though ostensibly about thirty mil
lions, It is~really, including our guarantees,
somo forty-six millions. Many of our pre
sent available means for its payment, must
become useless in event of a total dismem
berment. Then comes repudiation or direct
taxation !
Consider, moreover, the unfortunate ton-,
ditionof many of the Southern State finan- j
ces, and theheavv burdens we should have
to bear in the now government. Even it a
traceable division occurs, we must assume
our share of the United States debt?which
in last June was $45.000,000-and will be
then much more. Virginia's share would
probably be some four or five millions.?
Thus would our debt be run up to more
than fifty millions? The condition of many
of our Southern States may be as bad in
many respects. The repudiated heavy debt
of Mississippi might be claimed by her
siron^ creditor; and who shall say it will
not bs when the arm and power of the pre
sent government are withdrawn >
Again, Forts Moultrie and Monroe, ana
other fortresses in the South have beon
for, and largo sums expended on them by
the General Government. We must con
quer or buy them. Either course will prove
an onerous burden to us. ^
In addition to all this, it is clear that
nothing but the re-opening of the A.ncan
Slavs Trade, (to which we would not, 1 nro
sume consent,) will save Virginia, Ken
tucky, Maryland, and ?.lis30uri, from ulti
mately becoming/Vet' States. If we desired
this trade, an attempt to establish it, would
involve us in new difficulties with theNortlu
and with France and England likewise. It
on the other hand, we escaped these diracul
?the success of that trade would ruin
our white laboring people. But if the
States referred to become tree, what peace
should we have in the new Southern Con
federacy ? ., ..
It is well to remember too,^ that wuh all
its advantages, it eo;>t3 the General Govern
inont not "tess than $600 for each regular
soldier, armed, equiped. and maintained for
one year. The cost of Volunteers is double.
Virginia would require not less than 10,000
regular troops, for several years, at least
involving an annual expense of six millious
of dollars?to which we must aud pay of
her officers, costs of transportation, fortifica
tions, &e. , . . .
Such are 301116 of the difficulties \ irgmia
would experience in a Southern Confedera
cy. Should she not then remain where she
now is till we are sure of something better?
Instead of being "'defenceless, her frieudiy
and conservative attitude would ensure tor
hor greater power and influence than^ we
could any where else enjoy. But should it
prove otherwise, we shall still have the
remedies hereafter, which are now proposed.
In the name of all that is good jmd dear
then, let us wait and ponder. Delay can
bring no greater danger. Haste penis
everything! F1DCS.

Business Affaire.
The Asia reports a recovery of ? to i in cotton
at Liverpool, but, private circular advices by the
samo steamer give quotations below the market.,
and new e?>tton shipped ns middling Orleans from
this side was selling at 7id. This improvement,
however, will certainly be short-lived. The re
lief in the money market will be followed by still
greater stringency under our advices.
There are somo symptoms indicating rather an
unpleasant strain on the nominally non-suspended
banks of New York and Boston and their "coun
try cousins" round about. At New York on Sat
urday we notico that iu the domestic exchanges
Boston was rather easier, { per cent., the seller
guaranteeing against suspension. The Post also
says: ?"Considerable uneasiness is felt in regurd
to New Englaud, and New York begins to enter
tain strong doubts of its ability to sustain the pro
minent points eastward, though the country banks
of the near eastern States report less pressure of
circulation.'*
An unfavorable feature at New York is a re
turn of the stagnation in foreign exchange, the
difficulty in negotiating mercantile bills now be
ing as great as before the bank measures of relief
went into operation. For the Arago, on Satur
day, the market closed very depressed, and rates
wide and irregular. The demand amounts to al
most nothing. Tho range for bills on Loudon is
nominally 98 to 104.
The New Orleans banks mako a strong show
ing, several holding nearly dollar for dollar of spe- !
cie to their liabilities. Most of the specie which j
goes to New Orleans direct, does not, however, rc- j
main there, but fiude its way up to .Memphis and j
St. Louis, and other river points. ^
There were several mercantile failures in New ;
York last week, under the severe pressure in mo- j
ney, and the great derangement and block in the i
produce business. The Post of Saturday evening j
says:?''The derangement of the produce business |
at this point has seldom involved greater sacrifi
ces than now, and if- is not surprising that the
wealthiest Louses succumb. Several of our lead
ing receivers havo suspeuded within a few days,
with a ^reat abundance of imperishable property
on hand, which is unavailable for even paying
transportation charges." Tho N. Y. Commercial of
Saturday evening aino has-a paragraph showing tho
effect in the dry goods trade, viz:?"As an indica
tion of the tone of the market, we may mention
that some of the large dry goods houses are send
ing circulars to their customers, offering for imme
diate payment, a settlement with a rate of dis
count at tho rate of two per cent, a month.?
There have beeu some failures during the week.
The stock market was lower again at tho Balti
more board on Saturday, but at. New York there
was a reaction for the better from the great break
down of the previous day, when Tennessee O'a
foil as low as 64 from 72, ^witH sale* of $-10,000,)
iVirginias to 74, Missouri's to 61, and North Caro
lina's to 785.
! The domestic exchanges do not improve but ra
I ther grow worse. On all Southern points tho
j rates aro unsettled.
The Richmond "Whig says:?"The times are
] "hard," as ever, and while more calmness pro
j vails, tho prossure is evidently tightening. We
j hear of several large failures, in this city?one
! an old established house. We hear of discharges
I of w^rkmeu; and of employer.* reducing th? wor

ment."

THIRTY-SIXTH CONGRESS.
[REPORTED TOR TH3 ALEXANDRIA GAZKTrE.j
In Senate, 3Soiiday, Dec. 10.
After prayer and the reading ol the jour
nal,
Tim President laid, before the Senate, a
communication from the Secretary of Stjite
in relai.i<>n to American Seaman.
Mr. Sumner, of Mans., asked unanimous
consent to have the memorial printed, which
was agreed to.
Mr. Bigler, of Penn., introduced a resolu
tion that the Standing Committees of the
last session Uc continued, and that the! resi
dent of the Senate be authorized to lill all
vacancies. The resolution was agreed to.
Mr. Sumner presented a memorial from j
Thaddqus llyatt asking congressional aid for ;
the inhabitants of Kansas now in danger of :
starvation, either by an appropriation or a ,
grant of land. On the motion of Mr. Sum
ner, the resolution wras referred to the Com
mittee on Territories.
Mr. Powell gave notice of a bill to abolish
the franking privilege.
Mr. Powell called up the resolution mtro
duoep by him last week, as follows:
Resolved, That so much of tho President's
message as relates to the present agitated
and distracted condition of the country, and
the grievances between the slaveholding and
the non-slaveholding States, be referred to a i
special committee of fifteen members, and that j
said committee he instructed toinquirc wheth
er any additional Legislation within federal
authority and duty be necessary for the pro
tection and security of property in the States,
and, if so, that they T.pors by bill. And that
said committee be, also, instructed to consider
and report upon the expediency of proposing
such an amendment or amendments of tho
Constitution of the United States as may
be necessary to give certain, prompt and lull
protection to the rights of property of citi
zens of overy State und Territory in the
United States, and ensure the equality of
the States and the equal rights ol ail the cit
izens aforesaid under the Federal Constitu
tion.
Mr. Powell said that the present disturbed
condition ofthe country demanded prompt
action. Already tho crisis had produced
distress to the land, and tho effects which
would follow a disruption had already begun
to be realized. He urged that our fathers,
when difficulties stood in xthe way of tho
Government, did not look to' disruption as a
reinody, but proposed now guarantees to
give peace to the country. It was int.iin
spirit that the Constitution had received
twelve amendments, lie trusted that, the
Senate would go forward in this wort; in the
spirit of our fathers.
* Mr. King, of New York, aid not despair of
the republic. He would have prcierred tl.av
the message should take its regular course,
but had no special objection to the present j
resolution, iic moved sundry uiucndincDiS j
to various portions of the resolutions- all
lookin" to the protection ofthe rights of per
sons and of the?U. S. Government, as well as
of propeaty. * .
Mr. Yulee asked Mr. King to explain the
object he wished to accomplish.
Mr. King said he desired that the commit
tee should,In these days when the rights of
the General Government were assailed, see
what was necessary to secure these rights.?
The amendments, also, sought to direct t.ie
attention of the committee to the protection
of persons as well as property.
Mr. Green urged conciliation as the prop
er course to be pursued in this crisis. lie
did not desire amendments to the Constitu
tion, but of course would not be in the way
of a?y measure of conciliation. lie thought
the Government should be armed with power
sufficient to enforce its laws and protect the
rights ofthe States. He thought the meas
ure of establishing a Federal police force
along the line between the slave and free
States was the measure to be adopted, and
advocated that measure as ? proposed by
him some days since.
He locked forward to a reaction of public
sentiment, to the return of the good old
times of twenty years ago; but before this
change took place^ tho strong arm of the
government must intervene to protect the
States, and if possible clog tho wheels ol
dissolution until a reaction could take placn.
Mr. Latham rose to correct a misstatement
which had been widely circulated in the
public prints, to the effect that it was tne in
tention of the Pacific States to take ad\an
tage of the withdrawal of some States from
the Union, to ret up a Pacific Republic. This
was not the fact. California even if all the
South seceded would still adhere to the North.
Nothing could lessen the loyalty of her peo
ple, but the want of overland mails or the
non-construction of the Pacific Railroad.
Mr. Foster, of Connecticut, said that as a.l
the branches of the government, except one,
was in the hands of the Democratic party,
that party should not fear^ any evil result. .
fiom the operations of the Government. %
Mr. Douglas hoped that the name of par
ty would not be introduced into the delibe
ration? of the Senate upon this vital ques
tion. .He was as much a party man as any
one 11 poll the floor, but he trusted that party
politics would now be abandoned while these
questions were being discussed. (Applause
in the naileries.)
The presiding ofneer said that signs of ap
proval or disapproval from the galleries were
indecorous, and must be stopped.
Mr. Mason said that it was an indig
nity of the Senate, and upon fhe repetition i
of such conduct, he would move thajtho gal- j
leries be cleared.
Mr. Davis, ol Miss., was astonished ti- the
tone which the debate had taken, ine Sen
ator from Missouri proposed to give the gene
ral uovernmf'nt powers almost monarchical,
while the Senator from California had de
clared that if the stipends of the Federal
Government were not withheld, California
would be a most faithful and obsequeous.
lie denounced such doctrine as tending to
the corruption of the government and the
enslavement of the people. The govern
ment was intended to be, not a government of
the people, but a government of State?.
The Union was dear to him as a Lnion of*
fraternal States; it would loose its value as a
Union held together by force. Could the
^'outh be assured of fraternal feeling in the
Northern heart, ytih might burn your statute
books. It was out of the loss ot this feeling ^
that the present danger grew. The Union
could not be saved by quack nostrums. *t
wanted the action of the whole people.
Mr. Foster, of Conn., defended the posi
tion he had taken and declared that he hud
not sought to introduce party politics into j
the present crisis ot the country.^
Mr. Green, of Mo., wan surprised at tho
language ot Mr. Davis, in designating h?->
reso lution as a quack nostrum. The quack,
both in medicine and politics was he who
expected to accomplish results without>
means. But in this case he was not the man ;
who proposed quack practise. ^ lie quot< >i j
the constitution to show that it looked to .
precisely such protection of the states as his j
resolution contemplated. It meant no mili
tary despotism as charged by the Senator ,
from Mississippi. The truth was that some ,
of the states were going out of too Lnion. ,
with cause, or without, and were determined J
to misrepresent every eff">rt msde to save it. j
The S;ntes of Missouri, Kentucky, and V ir- j
ginia had all aiong fought the battles of the j
Sr'Uth. The states represented by the Sena
tor from Mississippi, never lost, a slave ex
cept one, who had been sent off boxed up.? j
He did not despair of the Union. The pro- :
i er appeals from one section of the Union to
the other had not been made; there had been
crimination and recrimination, but the ap
peal which should be made of friend to
friend, and brother to brother, had not been
made He would clothe Mr. Lincoln with
,hc same authority with which he won d
clothe any other Present, and would ho d
him to the same responsibility He would
i'0 fur the enforcement of the lederal laws,
upon the individuals ot a state as long us
tliQt state remained in the Union, but when
she receded, she became an independent
power, and the United States government
ceased to have authority over her.
' Mr. Latham, of California, s.ud ho did
not intend to say that the people of Califor
nia would consider the wantot an over, and
mail or the non construction ol the PaciJic
Railroad, cause for disunion.
Mr. Davis, of Mississippi, was glad to
know ho had misunderstood the intent; he
was certain that he did not misunderstand j
the words of the Senator. He declared that:
the proposition of Mr, Green would give the ;
federal government a power not contcmplat
ed hv the Constitution, almost monarchical in j
its tendencies and dangerous to the liberties i
of the people. It was a time for patriots to j
meet the danger, face to face, ascertain where j
the evil lies and give the remedy a depth ,
and power that the occasion demands. Our j
fathers made this Union a union of friendly <
states; sectional strife has substituted a col- j
lection of hostile sovereignties, lie indig
nantly repudiated the idea that a sovereign j
state could bo coerced, and tlio people forced ,
to paes under the yoke. This was a limited j
government, nn ugeocy of con unvoted pow- i
ers. Our father bound us together with the i
chain of mutual love; they broke the coain ?
of power and made the nation free. Now it j
was proposed to degrade their sons and by
force to rivet the chains of federal power up
on them. Il the Republicans v.cie willing
to stand bv the guarantees our fatbersjnade,
and give tho South equal rights in the gov
ernment, let them say so. Mention had been
mado of the Union as costing treasure, time
and blood, this was not so. It was framed
in a little time, without expenditure and
without blood. Our fathers fought for the
freedom of the states, and, tho Union v. as an
afterthought. lie loved the Union, but as
he would not keep a beautiful and odorifer
ous flower if there was poison in its petals,
so he must cast away the Union, when it was
u>ed for oppression, lie believed the cauuon
of federal torts along the Southern frontier
might be turned against us aud thereiore op
posed it.
Mr. Sumner said that at some future time,
it would be due to the justice of history
that he should make some remarks upon a
portion of tho President's message. He
would refrain on this occasion, however, and
only offer to the Senate as a portion of the
testimony, bearing upen present events, an
autograph, and unpublished letter of Andrew
Jackson, written in 1832, to a clergyman in*
? he siavcholding States. -Uj then read a
loiter, in which Gen. Jackson writes to tho
Rev. A.J. Crawford, that nullification was
over, that the tariff had but afforded the pre
textfor an attempt to diwoiva the Union on
the part of those who wished to put an end
to its existence, aud that the next pretext
would be the negro. Time had, he said,
vidicated the sagacity of one of the best men
the slaveholding States had ever produced.
Mr. Benjamin desired t.) ask Mr. King, ot
New York, if the object of the amendments
he prooos. d in the morning, wa-j to secure
the use of physical armed force to enforce
upon the peonle of a seceding State the now
existing laws'of the Federal Government, ^
Mr. King responded that the intention Oi
his amendment might be expressed in the
lew words, "the Union shall be preserved.
He hoped that it would need no other sup
port than the good sense and patriotism ol
the people. Secession was but another name
{'i?r insurrection or reoelliou. iiio Union
cannot be diesolvftdi There will be nooonflict
with the St tes. The individuals who violated
the law would alone be punished aud none
but thoso who violated the law be at all in
terfered with. This he presumed would bo
tho action of tho government in case or
secession. . . ,
Mr. Dixon, of Connecticut, said^ that tne
fact that tho interests of both too North and
the South were in great peril, was plainly
now before the Senate, and it became them
to act with the utmost wisdom in an auair
80 grave. If there were those who wished
sectional war, he was not with them. 1 t
believed that the matter could be adjusted il
time was given. His constituents were
ready to concede anything that a reasonable
man could ask, or an honest man grant.
Mr. Brown, of Mies., thougut that tho
only way in which the North could save the
Union, would bo to reverse their entire plan
in regard to slavery. He believed the Union
was ui utter darkness, there was no ray of
hope tor it. The republicans understood
this and stood by their arms. The compromise
suggested by the Albany Journal had been
repudiated at once by tho New York electors
and there was no hope from that quarter.?
We of the South had registered an oath in
heaven never to submit to the degredation of
wearing a Nor then yoke. Look which way
you would, there was no hope for the Union,
and i-t was time people understood it. He
hadLbeen told receutly of a Republican mem
ber who said "we do not intend to ground
our arms until we have emancipated the last
slave." It w as time for the North and South
to pait?in peace if possible, if not, in wo.r.
We must meet face to face either in a peace
able or a violent separation, lhe issue was
made up, and he was content to leave it to
his people. .
Mr. Pugh, of Ohio, could not permit the
argument ol Mr. Brown to pass without a
remark. After an experience of 7t? years,
he wa5 surprised that the Senator should
declare that tho people of the North and
the South could not meet and adjust the
differences between them. He believed
there was hope lor the Union, and exhoited
the South to delay until the people of the
North had time to act upon the question,
ile was surprised the other day to boar Mr.
Hale advise tho coercion of a SiawO. lie
did not believe Mr. Buchanan would send
troops to coerce South Carolina. If idr.
Buchanan should so act, enough of his term
would be left for him to be impeached in
this chamber. What would South Carolina
be worth to you, brought captive and in
chains. He advocated conciliation and com
promise, and opposed extreme measures,
it was easy for Senators from the extreme |
North audrSouth to argue this question lo
gically, but to the citizens of the Border
States on both sides of the iitic, and to their
wives and children, it was a question o.
terrible import. He besought Senators to
consider the matter woil. He paid a high
compliment to the patriotic remarks of Mr.
Dixon, of Connecticut.
Mr. Brown said that he had no difficulty
with his friend from Ohio, it was with th?
power behind him. It was the Republican
party that heid the North now; they were
the men with whom ho was called to deal.
Mr. Pugh said he had to fight the Repub
licans, The gentlemen from Mississippi
had nothing to do with thorn.
Mr. Brown responded that it the gentle
man from Ohio was the representative of the
North. anfi nP' (^r* ?') ?* Soiwh, there
would be no difficulty, the question would
be settled before sundown. (Laughter.)
But unfortunately such was not tho c|ise.
Mr. Ilale said that he was surprised to
find himself misrepresented by the Senator
from Ohio, certainly he knew such a thin^r
was not int&uded, for he believed the h?s>
nessof misrepresentation I el mged cspec a iv
to those miserable beings wiiorn God pern ii
to edit Democratic papers in the North
(Laughter.) He de-.ied i\v? he M said
that ho wanted to sae if Mr. <>u banan
would send troops to South Carolina. He
had said no snch thin?. He had said war
,
would cosuc; not that "it should co'mo. He
believed not that Mr. Buchanan would send
troops tn South Carolina, but that he was
now 0:1 hi4 knees before South Car-.il:na beg
ging her.for God's sake to stave oft hfir so*
cession until alter the fourth of Maicli.
(Laughter.) ilo never did say, for he never
did believe that Mr. Buchanan *wouid send
troops to South Carolina. He had not heard
with distinctness a portion .of the remarks
of Mr. Davis, but bad understood him to
declare that the Republicans had brougut
the government to this peril, and that they
should apply the remedy. He had crossed
the chamber to ascertain how correct wan
this understanding, for notwitnstanding it
had been said a social war existed on this
floor, he frequently went over on the other
side, and always found kindness and cour
tesy there?even from the Senator from
Georgia, who tbo other day, drew tho picture.
Mr. Irerson. Only ou the surface, sir.
Mr. Ilale?then 1 must withdraw, so far
as relates to the Senator. lie believed that
the perils which now beset the country were
the just judgments of an oficodedGod upon a
people who had not appreciated his blessings
and who had been blind to his mercies.
Mr. Mason, of Va, would not speak did ;
he not fear that a simple vote for the resolu
tion might be interpreted to mean that he
had some hope of saving the Union by such
means. He did not believe that any act of
Congress could arrest the impending dissolu
tion of the Union. In Virginia the people
did not look to Congress for a remedy. His
state and others were going into conventions
to consider the subject for themselves, and
tho people had ceased to look to Congress
for a legislative remedy. The State he rep
resented had taken the subject in hor own
hands, and he trusted such resolutions as had
been offered would not seduce the people into
believing that there was hope for the Union,
lie believed the States of the North and
West would do well to refer this subject to
state conventions, and let the States, acting
in their highest political capacities, look to
the wrong and declare the remedy; from
such assemblages he would expect much.
As he viewed the question, the difficulty grew
out of a social war?a war, not now ot arms,
but of sentiment.
In his judgment the people of the North
felt that they had a vast numerical majority,
and haying been nursed in opposition to tho
social forms elsewhere existing, they bad de
termined to extinguish those forms, not by a
single blow, but gradually, by the exercise
of the power of the Federal government,
lie thought the subject ought to be consider
ed, not here, but at home. He did not
wish the wrong impression to go forth that
any remedy was to be expected Irom feder
al legislation. He understood the Senator
from '"New York, Mr. King to develope the
means by which it was proposed that the
Federal government should exercise its pow
ers. He understood that Senator to declare
that the contest would be between the Uni
ted States aud individuals; that in a
struggle against tho I" ederal power, the
state'"is to bo considered as non-existent.?
Ho had accordingly denominated, by a
misuse of terms of civil policy, the acts of a
seceding state in defending herself against
the General Government, rebellion aud in
surrection. Call it what they pleased it
was open war?the meeting in arms of one
political power, with another political power,
lie believed every reasonable man would
soon see this.
Mr. Higler, of Penn., said that tho times
were full of peril, and he proposed to ad
dress a few words to the S?nate.
lie gave way, however, to a motion that
the Senate adjourn, which was agreed to,
and, at 3o'clock, the Senate adjourned.
House of Representatives.
The House met at 12 M.?prayer by the
Chaplain.
Mr. Hawkins rose and withdrew the call
for the previous question which ho made on
Thursday last, asking to be excused from
serving on the Special Committee ou the
President's Message. He said that he would
not act contrary to the will and instruct olb
of his Legislature and constituents in serv
ing on the Committee. He said that it was
his opinion, that if he, the Speaker, had act
ed in accordance with his own views and
feelings, instead wt consulting with others,
he would have appointed a different Com
mittee. Why was not the North Western
Democracy represented on the Committee ?
There was not"one North Western Democrat
appointed, vet their constituency, numbered
more than* 1,600,000. Where were Yalan
digharn and Cox, and such like spirits ?
Surely, seine respect was due them as repre
f-entatives. Another objection was, that men
had been appointed on the Committee who
did not represent their constituency. Was
the appointment ot the gentleman Irom Ma
ryland (H. Winter Davis) a fair or proper
one? Diu not the Maryland Legislature
pass resolutions denouncing that gentleman
for voting for the present Speaker of tl e
House ?
Mr. Brigs* rose to explain, hut
Mr. Hawkins informed that gentleman
that ho understood his position, and knew
wcil that "were he not Alexander, he would
be Diogenes." With such men on the CVm
mittee, a political millennium will not short
ly be brought about. He would tell the
Republicans that Georgia. South Carolina,
Mississippi, Alabama, and Florida were sure
to secede, and that Arkansas, Louisiana, and
Texas would shortly follow.
Mr. Valandigham expressed much iuuig- |
nation at the manner in which the North ,
Western Democracy had been letc without
a voice in the Committee, and said that the
Republicans had mistaken the men they had
to deal with, and said he would vote to ex
cuse the gentleman from Florida.
Mr. McClernaad sooke briefly against the
appointment of the Committee.
After which, Mr. bicklos made a speech
in behalf of the city of New lork.
After further debate, the subject was laid
over. t
Mr. Sherman reported a bill to provide for
tho issuing of Treasury notes, and for other
purposes.
A number of amendments were proposed,
and the matter discussed for sometime.
The bill was tinaily read a third lime and j
passed. _ !

Boat Stamped with Two Men* Aboard
One Man Drowned, and the other Rescued
uy a Steamer:?A sad accident happened
last night, in the river Potomac, off the
Penitentiary wharf, which has probably re
sulted in the death of Mr. George Howard,
for a'long time, a resident of this city.
It appears that about dusk last evening,
| Mr. Howard and his son, John Howard, a
I young man about IS years of age, started
| from Washington in a small boat to carry a
j load of oysters to Blader.sburg. The even
j in# was quite cold and inclement, and the
! boat swamped and sank ofi" the Penitentiary,
i about dark... The mast of the little vessel
j remained above water, and to it Mr. Howard
j and his son clung, till admonished by the in
i crca*ing darkness, aod aiinost benumbed by,
the coldness ot' the water, Mr. Howard un
dertook to swim ashore and procure help,
leaving his son still clinging to the mast of
the vessel. Whether he reached the shore,
is not known, but his Bon believes he swam
but a short distance, and was drowned.
Soon after Mr. Howard had left the boat,
the steamer George Page, Capt. Gedney,
passed near the scene of the disaster on her
j mail trip down. A cry for help was heard
j from the waters, and caught by the quick
ear of the commander of the steamer. He
listened, and again the cry was repeated?a
wail of distress, which the Captain declares
is of such a character that it rings further,
and is heard clearer, than any other sound of
the human voice. Instantly the steamer
was stopped, a boat lowered over her side,
manned, and sent out in the darkness in tho
direction of the sound. It soon neared it,
and found the young man, Howard, almost
exhausted and frozen, but still clinging with
the grip of a vice to the mast. He was res-,
cued, and taken on board the steamer, where
every attention was paid to his necessities,
and upon arriving in this city, was cared for
by the kindiy hospitality of Oapt. Gedney.
Mr. Howard was well known in this city,
having kept a barbershop on Fairfax street.
He was for a short, period Captain of one of
the Aloxandria and Washington steamers.
Fire.?A fire occurred on Thursday last,
about five o'clock 'id the capenter's shop of
Mr. Henry Parker, on G street, near Seven
teenth, in Washington, whereby the shop it
self was consumed, and the lire caught to the
adjoining brick house, tenanted by Mr. Mil
ton Garrett. Mr. Garrett's furniture was
destroyed. The stables in the rear of these
buildings were also consumed, and a clean
sweep was made of the ground around the
row. The fire was an incendiary one. Mr.
Parker was not insured. Mr. Lutz was par
tially insured; the value of his property des
troyed was about $3,000. in consequence
of supplies of ardent spirits to some young
men who acted as firemen, several became
intoxicated; the consequence of which was
great disorder, requiring the energetic in
terference of the pulice, who made several
arrests.
Robbery or a Longboat.?Last night the
longboat Great Western, of Occoquan, G. J.
Haines, master, lying in the canal, south
side, near Twelfth street, was boarded and
the cabin broken open and robbed. The
property stolen was ninety dollars in Corpo
ration of Georgetown five dollar notes, and
one or two Corporation of Alexandria notes;
a revolver, Colt's patent; one silver hunting
case watch, with the crystal broken ; and
one small gold watch, with white face and,
one hand broken off. The money was the
receipt for the wood brought to this city on
the boat, and the watches were entrusted to
the Captain to be repaired.? Wash. Star.
Work and Pay.?The Culpeper Observer
comes to the proper resolution that having
worked long enough for nothing, it will here
after have the money to which it is justly en
titled. Its experience is that of most news
paper publishers. It says: "We have work
ed for fairs, concerts,' &c., ever since we
have been in the place?without receiving
oue cent in return?and if we have ever re
ceived the thanks of those concerned for our
trouble, expense and labor, we don't know it.
It costs us a large sum every week in cash,
to print our paper, and it is not reasonable
to suppose tLat we can work for nothing."
Christian Association Prayer Meeting
for the Union.?In compliance with a re
quest from/ the Christian Association of
Troy, New York, and in accordance with the
desire of many of our people, a prayer meet
nj will be held on Thursday afternoon next
at 4 o'clock, at the rooms of the Young
Men's Christian Asssociation, to which the
citizens generally arc invited, to offer up
prayers and supplications to Almighty God
for the restoration of peace and harmony to
our now distracted country.
Alexandria Hotels.?We notice in our
Virginia exchange paper*, recently, very
complimentary notices of the Hotels in this
city. Tney deserve the "good words" spo
ken of them. During the late meetings of
the Stockholders of the Railroads, and of the
Methodist Conference, they were all crowd
ed, and yet gave much satisfaction to their
guests?ana all travellers and sojourners
speak favorably of their fare and their ac
commodations generally.
Prof. Anderson.?Notwithstanding the
inclemency of the weather, a large compa
ny greeted Prof. Anderson, last night, upon
the occasion of his first appearance in' this
city. Since the year 1853, during which
interval he 1.as travelled through many lands,
and judging from some of his exploits lust
riigbt, he has certainly not failed to im
prove his opportunities.
Postponed.?The opening of the Ladies' i
Fair for the benefit of the Mount Vernon
Guards, which was to have taken place last
night, was postponed until to-night, on ac
count of the unfavorable weather. To-night
the fair will open at Sarepta Hall where the
Company will appear in full uniform, and
go through a dress parade.
Collision on the River.?Tho shooner
Spray, Capt. Pherson, bound up. w:is run
into by an unknown shoonor on Sunday

$10,000,000 in United States Treasury notes.?
