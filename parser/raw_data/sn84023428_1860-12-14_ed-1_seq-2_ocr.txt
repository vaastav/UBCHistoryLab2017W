Lamoille Conntr Court.
' FRIDAy, FOURTH DAY.
This morning, No. 81 on the docket,
State vs Henry Avery came on for triaJ.
State's Attorney & Heath for the State,
T. Glecd for Respondent.' Tlie complaint
charges the'Rcspondent, a teacher, with
inflicting improper and excessive punish
ment upon a pupil. It was first tried be
fore a justice court, where he was found
guilty and fined one. dollar. From this
judgment the Respondent appealed to the
County. Court: 'Verdict Not Guilty.
This Verdict we believe to be a just and
wise one. The danger of encouraging
insubordination in schools by sustaining
the complaints of every impudent and
saucy school boy who may fancy himself
aggrieved, is greater than the probability
that a teacher will punish him improperly
and with too great severity to prevent it.

CiT We see by looking over its oolums
Newsdealer) that it seems to be in a little
extra haste to wipe out our personal liber
ty law. We trust our friends will not be
in a hurry about it Perhaps we do not
need such laws here in Vermont, but it is
not best to be bullied into this business,
and much less to play flunkey. We dou't
believe the people of Lamoille County de
mand any such thing, certainly not unless
they are different from what they used to
be. Bellows Palls Times.
From the above it seems that the Times,
is somewhat exercised at the idea of doing
away with the Personal Liberty Bill; is
troubled at the thought that Vermont in
expunging an irritating, retalitory, uncon
stitutional law, may be considered as bul
lied or frightned into so doing. Aside from
the question of its being unconstitutional,
the Personal Liberty Rill is inoperative,
aud uncalled for ; inoperative from its
very nature, because its spirit was in the
pcoplo as much before as after its passage,
and all men knew it ; and uncalled for, be
cause Vermont, always on the side of free
dom, needs not to stoop to idle enactments
to convince the world of the fact.
A man is blind who docs not see the
peril of our union ; if tho simple . act of
doing exactly right, would reach with rea
son, men wild with political absurdities,
bent upon tho distraction of our proud na
tion, shall fear of ridioulo, or of the unrea
sonable, Bonseless imputation of being
bullied, prevent the doing of so noble a
deed? t " . , ' " ,
We are not frightened, but simply in
haste to have a retaliatory spirit give
place to that of forbearance ; to show to all
men that our love of the constitution is
greater than our fear of ridicule ; in haste
to snatch from political fanatics the only
weapon they can use with success in sev
ering this, our dearly-bought Union. The
people of Lamoillo country, at least, will
aver play flunkey to the bullying fear of
ridicule, for they are of the sons of Ver
mont, the mountain-bred Green Mountain
Boys, who know no fear, and never flinch,
if right, though the world may be op
posed to them.
The Kingdom of Half.
Very few comprehend the extent of the
great revolution that has just been con
cluded in Europe. So accustomed arc we
to think of Italy ' as composed of several
petty governments, into which she has for
so long a time been divided,0 that it is
difficult to have a clear knowledge of her
present territorial extent, or of the very
largo number of people who now rejoice
under the sceptre of Victor Emanuel. Let
us compare her present extent of territory
with our own State. The number of
square miles in the new kingdom is nearly
95,000, or about ten times greater than
Vermont. Her estimated population is
now twenty millions, or the same as the
total population of the U. S. in 1850.
The wonderful fertility of her soil, her
world-renowned climate, and her central
position in Europe, give such natural ele
ments of greatness, that no land can com
pare with her. Her productions for ex
port have always been extensive, even un
der long misrule. , Who then can estimate
her future under the fostering government
of Victor Emanuel, when improvements
in agriculture, and in the mechanic arts,
shall be the order of the times, and when
growing knowledge shall, with growing
wealth, give her a power second to none
in Europe? Long live Italy, and may
her people be worthy of the patriotio de
votion of a Garibaldi.
0 Italy o a wholo kingdom, lasted only to the
time of the barbaric Odacer, who overturned the
throne of Augustuluu, and soon after the great
Iioinun Empire was broken into fragment.
From Washington. In the House on
Monday, a Homestead bill and a bill au

BT The story of the awful doings of
Mjntgomery and his band in Kansas, has
turned out to be all a boax, and the Mis
souri milita, called out in haste by the
Governor of that State, are having a
very fine time all for nothing. The Bos
ton Journal says :
According to the latest accounts from
the Missouri army, the troops were suffer
ing scverly from the difficulties and hard
ships of their wild-goose campaign. The
men are experiencing all the hardships
of war, unrelieved by any of its illusions ;
marching in the depths of winter through
the snow, over mud roads interspersed with
half-frozen sloughs, carrying heavy knap
sacks and muskets, and sleeping at night
on the cold, frost-baked ground, yet so
fevered by the exhausting toils of the
day that they plunge for relief into the
ice-running streams as soon as a halt is
Lordcrcd. All are travel worn, fatigued.
foot-sore, and many lamed and sick.
Western Missouri is no paradise at
this season of the year, and ; yet six or
seven hundred men, drawn mostly from
the neighborhood of St. Louis, are hurry,
ing through it by forced marches, the
victims of a shameful humbug. In addi
tion to this, the people of tho State will
have to pay roundly for the unfortunate
and uncalled for expedition. ti

carrying on their operations for some time.
Snow is in jail at Irasburgh, under $800
bonds. Ryder's bail was fixed at $G00,
which having procured, he was set at

will undoubtedly be well patronized, by
tho old and young, tho coming winter.
The Caledonian says of it; . " Thcro arc
about eight acres to bo flowed, enclosed by
a railing, and without the railing a high
board fence, which will serve to break the
wind and keep snow from drifting upon
tho ice. Within tho fence and outside
the railing is a carriage drive, so that
persons who wish to witness this delight
ful amusement can remain in their car
riages if they wish. Thcro is a building
at tho park where ladies and gentlemen
can put on their skates, warm themselves
or take refreshments. Everything suited
to the convenience or comfort of the
skater has been , furuished that mind
could conceive or hands execute. Mr.
Butler has been to a great expense to
make a safe, desirablo skating pond, and
one that can be used at any and all times
during the winter without reference to
snow storms." ,, , ,

Revival Notice.
Mr. Editor: It mav be a matter of
rejoicing to some of the readers of your
paper, to know that the Lord has glori
ously revived his work in Waterbury, Vt.
Nov. 3d, at the request of the pastor,
the Rev. B. Cox, I commenced a series of
religious meetings, (services in the eve
nings only,) in that place. It was very
soon evident that " the people had a mind
to work," and while the church sought
the baptism from on high, sinners began
to enquire after the way of life. There
were regular meetings kept up for four
weeks. More than fifty have been re
claimed and converted ; and when I left,
last Monday, the work was still progres
sing, and numbers were ' inquiring what
they must do to be saved. The work em
braces all classes, from tho child of 10,
up to the sinner of CO years. A number
of heads of families, and a goodly number
of promising young ladies and gentlemen,
are nubcrcd with the saved.
For more than thirty years that I have
been conversant with revivals of religion,
in a very few instances have I witnessed
such visible diplays of Divine power as
were manifested on Sabbath, the 18th of
last month; as wo invited sinners to the
altar of prayer. Many were saved that
day. Praise the Lord for Salvation !
May the work of tire Lord spread
through all "this land. For the present
week I am preaching every evening at the
Town-house in Morrisvillc, and from
thence I go to Elmore.
" Let Zion arise and shine, her light
having come, and the glory of the Lord is

Hyde Tark, Dec. 6, 18C0. -
The President and the Secession
ists. It is undeniable that the general
effect of the President's Message had been
to encourage the secessionists. His1 po
sition, that he has no authority to restrain
or cocrco a seceding State, seems to bo all
they want under the circumstances. Even
his declaration with regard to defending
the fort and other public property of the
Government, is turned to their advantage.
The following is from tho Charleston
Mercury s review of tho message :
" He speaks of the forts in our bay as
property belonging to tho United States.'
" No attempt to expel the United States
from their property has been made ;" but
should it be made 4 the officer in command
of the forts has received orders to act
strictly on the defensive.' '
We infer, therefore, from these positions,
that the military power of tho United
States will not be used by Mr. Buchanan
to cocrco South Carolina, after she goes
out oftho Union. ! This bugbear is, there
fore, at an end." : ; ' ! ;
" What tho writer understands by the
words " to act Btrictly on the defensive,"
which he italicises, - we do not clearly
perceive j but it is something evidently
equivalent to no defense at all. The idea
rccoives confirmation from tho fact that
tho commander of Fort Moultrie has but
eighty or ninety men, ; and that it has
been publicly ; announced that nd rein
forccment will be sent to him.' We have
hitherto deemed this part of the messago
as tho only practical point in tho Jong
disquisition on secession which comman.
ded the support of all patriotic mon. But
if our Charleston contemporary is right,
tho President had better have omitted
the subjects altogether. Boston Journal
Lord Palmrrton on the Prince's Vlilt to the
I'nltcd State.
At a public banquet recently held in
London, Lord Palmerston thus referred to
the Prince's visit to this country : .....
" We had not a right to expect that
when his Roval Hishncss visited the
.. y 14
United States he would be received with
anything more than tho courtesy which
civilized nations accord to distinguished
members of the reigning family of another
country. But I must say . it has been
...
most gratifying to witness tho cordiality,
the heartfelt kindness, the generous hos
pitality, and I may say the enthusiastic
delight with, which that illustrious Trince
was welcomed by our cousins in the United
States. . They have shown themselves,
indeed, to be a noble and generous people
they have shown that they have not
forgotten the common stock , from which
they and we have sprung ; and, in spite
of events which if not buried in oblivion,
might have produced some sight alienation
between us, they received our futuro sov
ereign and I trust that future may be
long distant they received the eldest son
of our gracious sovereign, and as if he
were a stranger belonging to another land,
but as if he had been born in , their own
country, and had been a citizen of their
own republic. I trust, gentlemen, that
the remembrance of the generous kindness
thus exhibited by the people of the United
States will ever be cherished by the people
of these kingdoms. I believe the memory
of the Trincc's vinit will long survive in
the breasts of the American nation, and
that these mutual recollections will tend
more closely than ever to knit together
those two great branches of the same noble
and I will say illustrious stock."
The English press generally expresses
a high degree of satisfaction with our
reception of the Prince. The London
News says: "He has seen a nation of
soldiers without an army civil order
without a police wealth, luxury and cul
ture, without a court or an aristocracy.
He has learned to mingle with the busy
crowd of men without the intervention of
courtiers; he has found respect without
ceremony and honor without adulation."
England and a Southern Confeder
acy. Tho tone of the English, press
utterly precludes the secession istsr from
indulging in any hope of encouragement
or sympathy in their schemes from the
British government. The Time sub
stantially adopts the Republican view of
the proscnt crisis, and charge the Southern
leaders with the responsibility of bringing
it on. The London News takes very
nearly the same ground. Tho Saturday
Review, the peculiar organ of the- most
cultivated circle of the kingdom, reviews
tho whole course and scheme of the se
cessionists with great severity. It declares
that if the purposed Southern Confederacy
should undertake to expand its area for
the purpose of extending Blavery, the
project would be resisted " by the whole
strength of European civilization." It
accordingly maintains that the strength
of tho South lies in the Union, both in a
military and a moral point of view. Some
of its allusions to British successes in the
South during tho Revolutionary war,
cannot bo very pleasing to Southern
readers. . -.
These accordant expressions of opinion
show that the British government wants
nothing of a Southern Confederacy. . Man-
cheater and cotton, contrary to tho asser
tions of many Southern orators, have no
power to compel a different result ' But
m fact it is for the interest of Great
Britain that the South should star in the
Union, where she can safely raise as much
cotton and prosper a well as under any
other state of things conceivable ' and
probably a great deal better , By seces
sion, South Carolina and her confederates
would do nobody any good, but would
hurt themselves moro than, all othcracora
bincd. Boston Journal.
