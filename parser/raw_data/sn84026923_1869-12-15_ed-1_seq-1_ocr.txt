PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE.
WAsiNO-rIN, December U.-The
flowing is the President's Message
road to-day in Congress:
To the &nate and
17ouse of Representatives.
GEORGIA To DE ItECONSTRUCTED.
Seven of the States which passed
the ordinances of suc.sion have been
fully restoted to their places in the
Union. 'Tihe eighth-Georgia-held
an election at which she ratified her
Constitution, republican in Sirm elect.
ed a Governor, members of CongresP,
State Legislature, and the other ffi
cers required. The Governor was in
stalled ; the Legislature met and per.
formed all the acts then required of
them by the reconstruction acts of
Congress. Subsequently, however,
in violation of the Constitution which
they Lad just ratified, as since decid
ed by the Supreme Court of that
State, they unseated the colored mem
bers of the Legislature and admitted
to their seats some members who were
disqualified by the third clause of the
fourteenth amendment; an article,
which they themselves had contribut
ed to ratify. Under these circum
stances, I would submit to you wheth
er it would not be wise without delay
to enact a law authorizing the Gover
nor of Georgia to conve'ne the mmni
be origically elected to the Legis
lgture, requring each to take oath
prescribed by the reconstruction acts,
and none to be admitted who are it:eli.
gible under the third clause of the
fourteenth amendment.
TiEa FREEDMEN.
The freedmen under the protection
which they have received, are making
rapid progress in learning, and no
ooaplaints arc heard of lack of indus
try on their part when they receive
fair remuneration for their labor.
TILE GoVERMENT INcOME.
The means provided for paying the
interest on the public debt, with all
other expenses of Government, are
more than ample.
TIlE LOSS OF OURI COMMERCE.
The loss of our commerce is the
only result of the late rebellion which
has not received sufficient attention
from you. To this subject I call your
earnest atentioL. I will not now sug
gest plans by which this object may
be effected, but will, if necessary,
make it the subj et of a special mer
sage during the aession.
TIE ELECTIONs TINDEI 'IE RECON
TION ACT IN UHE SOUTH.
Congress, by joint resolution, au
thorized the Executive to order elec
tions in the States of Virginia, Mis
sissippi, and Texas, to submit to
then the Constitutions which each had
previously framed, and to submit the
Constitutions either entire or in sepe
rate paits to be voted upon at the dis
cretion of the Executive. Under this
authority eleetions were ealled. In
Virginia the election took place on
the 6th of July. The Governor and
Lieutenant-Gjvernor were elected and
have been installed. The Legislature
met and did all required by this reso
lution and by all the reconstruction
acts of Congresa, and abstained from
all doubtful authority. I reconimend:
tbat her senators and represeuntatives
e prmptl admiitted to their seatls
dthat the State be fully etoe
to its place in the family of States.
Elect ions wore' called in Mississippi
and Texas, to. commence November
30th-two days in Mississippi and
four in Texas. The elections have
taken place, but 'tbe result it not
known. It Ia hoped thatlth o ats of
the Legislatures of those States, when
they meet, will be such as to receive
your* approval, and thus close the
work of recolisbugon,
THlE IlENUMPTIoN o? 5PEofE~ tAYMIENT.
Among the evils growing out of the
rebellion, and not yet referred to, Is
qI'hat of an irred emable eurrenoy. It
is ab evil which I hope will receive
your Engst Oairgest attention. It is a
dutty, and one of .the highest duties of
Government, to Securo to the citizen a
medium of f~ed and iitvarylng value.
This impllee a return to a speceo ba

late n's to what will be the value of
the curroncy paid and received. I
earnestly recommend to you, then,
such legislation as will insure a gradu
al return to specie payments, and put
an immediate stop to the fluctuations
in the value of currency. The meth.
ods to secure the former of these re
sults are as numerous as speculators
on political economy. To secure the
latter, I see but one way ; and that is
to authorize the Treasury to redeem
its own paper at a fixed value when.
ever presented, and withhold from
circulation all currency so redeemed
until sold again for gold. The vast
resources of the nation, both develop
ed and undeveloped, ought to make
our credit the best on earth. With
less burden of taxation than the citi
zen has endured for the six years past,
the entire public debt could be paid
in ten years, but it is not desirable
that the people should be taxed to
pay it in that time. Year by year
the ability to pay increases in rapid
ratio, but the burden of interest ought
to be reduced as rapidly as can be
without a violation of contract. The
public debt is represented in great
part by bonds having from one to for
ty-five years to run, bearing interest
at the rate of five and six per cent.
respectively. It is optional with the
'Government to pay these bonds at any
period of the least time mentioned
upon their face. The time has alrea.
dy expired when a great part may be
taken in, and rapidly approaching
when it may well believed that all
which are now due may be replaced
by bonds bearing a rate of interest
not exceeding four and a half per
cent., as as rapidly as the remainder
become due they may be replaced in
the same way. To accomplish this it
may be necessary to authorize the in.
terest to be paid at either of the three
or four money-centres of Europe, or
by any of the asaistant treasurers of
the United States, at the option of the
holder of the bond. I suggest this
subject for the consideration of Con
gress, and also simultaneously with
this the propriety of redeeming our
currency, as before suggested, at its
market value at the time the law goes
into effect, inereasing the rate at which
currney will be bought and sold from
iy to dJay of' week to weoit, et thie
same rate of interest as the Govern
ment pays upon its bonds.
The subject of tariff and internal
taxation will necessarily receive your
attention. The revenues of the coun
try are gicater than the requirements,
and may, with safety, be reduced ; but
as the funding of the debt in a four
or four and a half per cent. loan
would reduce the annual current ex
penses largely, thus, after funding
justifying a greater reduction of taxa
tion than would now be expedient, I
suggest a postponement of this ques
tion until the next meeting of Con
gress.
TARIFF.
It may be advisable to mod ify taxa
tion and tariff in instances where un
just or burdensame' dIscriminations are
made by the present laws; but of a
general revision of the laws regulat
ing this subject I recommend the post.
ponement for the present.
11 INCOME TAx.
I also suggest a removal of the tax
on incomes, hut at a reduaced rate,
and this tax to expire in three years.
CUsTOMs.
With the funding of the national
debt, as here suggested, I feel safe In
saying that the taxes and revenue
from imports -may be reduced safely
from sixty to eighty millions per an
num at once, and may be still further
reduced from year to year as the re
sources of the country are developed.
FISUAL. 5TATEMENT OF THE GOVERN
MENT.
Theoreport of the Secretary of the
Treasury shows the receipts of the
Government for the fiscal year ending
June 80th, $370,948,747, and expo
49,0.'h siae o t e en
Buidg year ar'e 'more favorable to the
Government, and will nto doubt show a
muoh larger decrease of the public
debts. The receipts in the Treasury
beyond the expenditures bave exceed

to the eredif, of the sinking fund, as
proviea by law. To look up the'

we should abstain from enf'orcing our
views upon unwilling nat ione, and from
taking an interested part in quarrels
betwen different nations, or hetgeen
Governments and their subject. Our
course should always be in conforhaity
with strict justice and law-international
ind local. Such hap beenf the policy of
this Administration in dealing with
these questions for more than a year.
A valuablo province of Spain, and near
neighbor of onr-, in whom all our people
cannot but feel a deep interest, has been
struggling for independence and freedom.
The people and Government of the
United States entertain the same warns
feelings and sympathies for the people
of Cuba in their pending struggle that
they manifested throughout the previous
struggles between Spain and her former
colonies in behalf of the latter. The
contest has at no time -assumed condi.
Lion which amount to war in the senco
of international law, or which would
the exisietce osf a de facto political
organization of the insurgents sufficient
to justifv a recognize of belligerency.
The principle is maintained, however,
that this nation is its own judge of when
to accordl the right of belligerency either
to a people struggling to free themselves
from a Goverment they believe to be
oppressive or to independent, nation at
war with each other. The United
States has no disposition to interfere
with the existing relations of Spain to
her colonial possession on this continent.
They believe that its due time Spain and
other European Powers will find their
inttest in terminatin.g those relation
and establisl.ing their present d.pendent
Pow rs These dependencies are no
longer regarded as subjects of transfere
from one European Power to another.
When the present relations of colonies
ceases they are to become indepeudent4
Powers, exercising the right ot choice
and of self-control in the determination
of their future condition and relation
with other Powers.
The United States, in order to put a
atop to the bloodshed in Cuba, and in
the interest of t:e neighboring people,
proposed its good offices to bring the
existing contest to a termination. The
offer, not being accept 1y Spain on the
basis which we believe could be received
by Cuba, was withdrant n. It is hoped
that the good offices of the United
States may prove advantageous for the
settlement of this uihappy strife. In the
mean while, a number of illegal expedi.
tions against Cuba have been broken up.
It has been the endeavor of the Admin
istration to execute the neutrality law,
no matter how unpleasant the task,
made so by the suffering we endured
from the lack of like good faith towards
us by other nations.
CKNTRIAL AMERICA---THE DAnIICN CANAL.
The inter-oceanic canal, to connect
.ie Atlantic and Pacific oceans through
the Isthmus of Darien, is one in which
commerce is greatly interested. In
struction have been. given the Minister
to the United States of Colombia to
endeavor to obtain aitthority fur a
survey to determine the practicability of
the undertaking. In order to comply
with the agreement with the United
States of Colombia as to a mixed com
mission at Lima, it became necessary to
spud a commissioner and secretary to
Lima.
The good offices of the United States
to bring about peace between Spain and
the South American republics hiaving
been accepted by Spain, Peru, and Chilh,
a congress has been invited to held in
Washington during the present winter.
A grant has beeni given to Europeans
of an exerusive right of transit over the
territory of Nicaragua, to which Costa
Rica has given its assent, ; which, it is
alleged, conflicts with the vested right
of citizens of the United $tates. The
Department of State now has the subject
under consideration.
THEl SPANISh GUNBOATS.
The Minister to Petu having made
representations that there *sa a state of
war between Per and Spain, and chat
Spain was construeting in and ntear
Ne ork thirty gueuboats, which
might be osed by Spain to relieve the 1
naval force9 at Cuba to operate against1
Peru, order were given to prevent their
departni. No fourthier steps hiaving
been taken by the vepresenteatives of the
ZPernviani Gevernment to prevent the
departure of these vessel., am|| I
feeling aut horised to defain the property
of a n.ation *lth #hleh'wo, are at peace

rejection of the treaty was followed i
by a state of public fooling on both f

that my views in this, regard were

Btates has with any foreign nation. C
NATURALIZED CITIZENS.

ther countries lees fortunate than
our own sometimes inducos their citi. c
tens to come to the United . States fur
rhe sole urpose of bosoming natural 'O

turn to their native country and re

fflicial pohitions of trust or honor
which can only be hold by cthizeus of

It may be well to mention here the
mbarrassment possible to arise from
eaving on the statute-books the "o
'alled tenure-of-ofLfo acts, and to oar
testly recommend their total repeal.
t could not have bean the intention
f the framers of the Constitution, in
roviding that appointments made by
he President should receive the con
ont of the Bedate, that the latter
hould have power to retain in office
ersons placed there by Fedoral ap
oitments against the will of the
'resident. The law is inconsistent
rith a faithful and efficient adminis
ration of the Government. What
4ith Gan the Executive put in oflicials
arced upon him, and those, too, whom
o has suspended for reason? hlew
rill such officials be likely to serve
n Adnministration which they know
oesnot trust them?
For the sooond requisite to our
rowth and prosperi- y, time and a
rm but humane adninitration of ex
sting laws, laws amended from time
o tie as they may he inefLetive,
r prove harsh or unneoessary, are
robably all that are required.
INDIAN A bAIa .
'1'he third cannot be obtained by spe.
ial legisit icti. It must he regarded as
xed by the Constitution itself and cordi
lly acquiesced in by force of puihlic
pinion. From the foundation of the
rovernment to tio present, the manzgo.
tent of the original inhabitants of this
antinent(the Iudians)hae been a subject
f embarrassment and expe:se, and has
eenl attended with Continnon robberies,
inrders, and wars. From my own ex.
erience on the frontiers and in Indian
Juitries, I do not I ld eit her legilmion

The past, however, cannot be nndone,
ad the question must be met as we
cw find it. I have attempted a new

During the year unJd'ng September
30, 1869, the Patient Office issued 13,762
patunts, and its receipt were $686,329,
being $213,926 more than the expen.

I respectfully call your attention to
the reconnenctation or the Secretary of
the Interior for uniting the duties of
supervisiung the education of freedmen
with the other duties devolving upon
the Coiinissioner of )dincation.
If it is clIe desire of Congress to make
the census during the year 18'70 more
complute and purfect, I wouhi suggest
early action upon any plain that may be
:agreed upon. As Congress at the last
iesson appointed a cormittee to take
mito conasaderation stich merasures as
naight be deemed proper in reference to
the cene, anl to report a plan, I desist
frant tarayilg aiOre.
I recotilnea. to your favoratrle con.

liareaii for1,iberal appropriations. .In a
country so diversified in climate and soil
as ours, and withi a population so largely
elepenadent upon agriculture, the benefits
that can' be conferred by properly
fosterring this Bureau are incalcuktble.
I ulLeiro respectiully to cal) the atten.
Lion, of Congress to the inadequate
salaries of a number of the most imn
portant officers of the Government. In
this message I will not enumerate
thei, but wil specify only the Jus
tiers of the Supreme Court. No
.-bange has been made in their
salaries for fifteen years, Within
th~at. tie the labors of the Court have
lirgely increased, and the expences of
of hving have at least doubled. During a

The Worhi publishes some very in
toresting information as to the pros.
peots of trade. gleaned from inter
views with some of the more prowl
nnt nmerchants of New York. At A.
T. Stewart's, Westorn trade was re
ported "very dull," and this stato of
things was aecuutdel for in tonne
quence of the holding back of th.
crops by the farmers. Though the
Southern trade was deemed bottor
then that of the West, the same ten
denoy to withhold the products of
this section was observable. Cotton,
they thought at Stewart's, was bownd
to rise in price, after a whil'e. It wa,
concedo that a return to specie pay
monts would hurt the wholesale deal
ere but might be to the advantage of
retailers.
At another largo dry goods housr,

pite of the immense amount of busi

Leplying to a direct inquiry as to the
outhern trade, Mr. Roseafield said
" outhern trade is good ; and we
ook for still better trade in the course
