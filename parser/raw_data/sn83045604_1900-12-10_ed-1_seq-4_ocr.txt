Queen Victoria's Illness.
The reports which come from I.ondon
that Queen Victoria's health Is breaking
will M received with profound regret by
tho entire English-speaking world. It Is
to be hoped that the stories hgve been
exaggerated; making too much of the
natural weakness due to her advanced
ago, which Is aggravated at the present
time by the knowledge of the critical con
dition of her oldest daughter, the Empress
Frederick.
▼et, necessarily It must be but a Com
paratively brief period, tn the natural or
der of things, when her death must come.
She Is well Into her eighty-second yaar.
and has been on the throne eleven years
longer than any oilier monarch In Eu
rope, having been crowned In 1837; the
Emperor FraActs Joseph having acceded
to the throne of Austria-Hungary In 184*.
"Hie venerable Christian IX . king of
DsMnask,' la-one year th*n*nier of Queen
Victoria, having been born In 1018. Many
of the' thrones of Europe will ultimately
be oc?usled by the descendants of one or
the other of these venerable monarchs.
The emperor of Germany Is the grandson
of Queen Victoria; the emperor of Russia
Is the grandson of King Christian. Tho
throne of Great Britain will ultimately
daacend to the Duke of York, grandson
of both Queei Victoria and King Chris
tian. The prese it king of Greece Is a son
of King Christian, and the heir to that
throne Is married to a granddaughter of
Queen Victoria, a slater of the emperor
of Germany. The present empress of
Russia Is a granddaughter of Queen Vic
toria. The crown princess of Roumanla
la a granddaughter of Victoria. Four of
the minor atat«* of the present Herman
empire will also have descendants of
Queen Victoria on their thrones
The present king of Ihe Belgians Is a
cousin of Queen Victoria, and his wife is
a daughter of the late King Ix>ul* Phllllpe
of France.- Through I his Orleans connec
tion there Is a tie of relationship be
tween the royal family of Oreat Britain
and the royal houses of Italy. Spain and

The building of wooden ships has not
l-econ.. a lost art on the Atlantic by
means on the contrary, the Indiis
tr) «»ems (.> tie reviving about as fast as
any other In the country During lh«
present year there have l>een built In Ihe
Maine Shipyards i early tons of new
vessels, exclusive of the government war
ships In this tonnage hut one large aieel
ship is Included The Increase for the
y«.ir o\ei Is*, m upwards of HVftte tons.
The featuvw of the year's shipbuilding
in th. Maine >ard* is the Increase in the
t-ixe of the schooners now being laumh
•<! some if this year's ad.ittlon ta the
Ilwt being of absolutely gigantic propor-
Hon*, while »van larger onea are In con

50 feet beam and 24.8 feet deep, register
ing 1,401 tons gro*s. Each of these gigan
tic schooners has six masts, and each of
them I* equipped with *team winches for
handling canvas and cargo. Among oth
ers of the big schooner* launched thl*
year may be mentioned the Mary W.
Bowen. of 1.907 ton* net; the Helen W.
Martin, of 2,020; the Marie Palmer, 1,594;
the William C. Carnegie, of 2,390; the Van
Alleys Boughton, of 1.908; and the Pan
tile Palmer, of 2.075.
It Is only twenty year* ago that the
first four-masted schooner was built on
the Atlantic, the William L. Whlta, of M 6
ton*. This was thought at the time t >
be the extreme length to which schooner
building could go. The first of the live
masters was the Governor Ames, cf I,«M
ton*, built In MM, which has been a verv
successful vessel, with the exception of
her Initial voyage, on which she was dis
masted. In 1B9« two five-master*, each
In excess of 2.200 tons, were built, and
have proved money makers In the eo-)l
trade. This year sees the entry of the
six-masted schooner Into the coal trade,
and also the first Atlantlo-experlment of
sending a big schooner loaded with coal
on a deep-water voyage. The Vautlcal
Oaxette, from which these figure* are
obtained, Is convinced that there Is everv
chance of the big schooners engaging reg
ularly In the oversea trade
These schooners are driving the square
rigged vessels out of the Atlantic coast
ing trade, and there seems no reason why
they should not be equally formidable
competitors on the deep water. A six
masted schooner like the big ones launch
ed this year carries a crew of but thir
teen men all told. A sqnare-rlgged ves
sel of like tonnage carries about thirty
one men all told. Under the old British
rule. In the days of single topsails, the
crew for a square-rigged vessel of 3,Oft)
tons. If such had been In existence, would
have been sixty men and thirty boys, or
a total of Winety.
The Pacific coast has as yet tried no
experiments In the direction of building
schooners of audi dimensions as those
launched this yea. - from the Maine ship
yards, although tha three-masted achoon«
er' is common, especially Iti the coast lum
bar trad*. But they will com*. Th* proa
pect of carrying a 5,000-ton cargo In a
vessel costing tally 1130 000 and carrying
a crew of tout thirteen men. will catch the
ship-owners. should the six-masters prove
as successful money mskers as the llve
maiters have.
It seems rather unfortunate that young
Cornelius Vanderbilt should have been
compelled to give up a fortune merely be
cause he inaiated on marrying the woman
he lovel. The heirs have Just agreed to
the appraisement of the estate, and by
the final distribution poor Cornellun gets
only $7,500,000.
As Solid as Ever.
One of the reasons advanced In oppo
sition to cutting down the representation
from the Southern states In proportion
to their limitation of the suffrage Is thai
this will tend to prevent the breaking up
of the solid Boutn. t.eave these commu
nities alone, we are told, and their com
mon senr.e will presently bring them Into
ih'- Republican column, where all their
real Interests should lead them But re
new their sectional feeling by attacks
upon their treatment of the negro, and
you prevent the disappearance of sec
tionalism. which is so greatly to be de
sired
In the Srst place. It would seem that
the measure in question is a very mod
erate treatment of a very serious matter
It does not contemplate undoing what the
South has done, although that amounts
to « nullification of the constitution.
Three states hare excluded the negro
from the ballot by legislation whl h.
though It does not name him shuts him
out and leaves others In This Is abso
lute nullification of the fifteenth amend
ment. yet all the other Southern states
are preparing to follow suit.
Now It Is not even urged In congress
or out of It that thl* legislation must he
wiped away It Is woposed simply to
remedy the injustice of giving to a white
voter In a state where this system pre
vails from three to ten time* as much
wwglit In congress and In the electoral
« oliege a* to one In the states where the
suffrage is untrsmmeled The Southern
►tatea ma> persist In r»elr disfranchise
ment If they please But they must pay
th* price, not only written In the con
stltutloo but dictated hy every considera
tion of latmess and political equality Is
there anything sectional In Uila? Is It
.in attack upon the South? Is it not
a pric# which the Southern people should
!>e perfectly willing to pay for their dar
ing denial of the application of negro suf
frage In their territory?
Again, wa »a> that the experience of
the past does not warrant any confidence
in the disintegration of the solid 3o.;th
as a political aggregation. It Is true thai
Maryland and Kentucky have broken
away, but they arc border a titles at beat,

remainder of the Soutii has oeiar reach*4

full nercenes*. And what na* been the
attitude of the remaining state*? t«t
the support which every one of them
gave to William Jennings Bryan In the
late campaign be the reply.
We should have no quarrel with these
Southern states If their people were ar
dent admirer* of Mr. Bryan, believers In
the doctrines that he preached, and there
fore supporter* of his candidacy for rea
sons of conscience. But It Is not true.
They voted for him this year because he
was the Democratic candidate, and for no
other reason on earth, Thla Is amply
proved by the tone of their leading Jour
nal*. the utterances of their public men
and the expression* opinion by their
people.
This year the Interest* of the South lay
altogether on the *lde of Republican suc
cess, and they knew It. The free sliver
myth has passed from control among
them. It never had other strength than
such as the comparative scarcity of cur
rency In that section gave 11. The South
of today cares nothing whatever about
-the silver question. The whole South was
In favor of expansion. On Its merits, a
proposition to retain the Philippines would
have carried In a popular vote In every
Southern state. The South Is today In
favor of a protective tariff. Under the
stimulus of protection the great natural
wealth of that section I* being developed.
The South hope* to see protection pre
vail.
It Is matter of common notoriety and
common knowledge that the people all
through the South hoped that McKinley
would be elected. But they voted for
Bryan Just the same. Why? Because he
was the democratic candidate. "Wiey have
made of that party name a fetich against
which neither reason nor self-Interest
seems able to prevail. The Republican
party has made no attack on them and
proposes none. As they knew. Its suc
cess would not Imperil any Interest dear
to ther.i In the state or the nation. And
yet an archangel, on a platform sent
down out of heaven like the command
ments, would be last In the polling In
any Southern state unless he was on the
Democratic ticket.
What this strange and senseless bond Is
which stilt keeps the South solid we will
not attempt to say. But with the evidence
of Its existence so plain. It Is foolish to
stay our hands from any proper and nec
essary measure on. the ground that It
would prevent the break-up of the solid
South. It Is as solid as tvsr. and I* like
ly to be. Meantime the Republican psrty
should consider the rights of all tha vot
ers: and since It Is apparent that nothing
short of extreme measures which tha
people would not approve could establish
the negro In the constitutional lights now
denied to him, the least that It should
do Is to render Justice to all other voters
by making the representation of each
state In congress conform to the number
of Its legal voters Instead of to Its popa
latlon. »
Certain facto are commended to the at
tention of thoae Inclined to believe that
the election of president by direct popu
lar vo'e would be desirable. It I# now a
month since the late national election. Yet
probably no two authorities are agree-)
upon the exact figure* of the popular
vote. The Philadelphia Press fives Presi
dent McKlnley's plurality aa 847.897. The
Chicago Record make* It STt.m Both are
able and careful newspapers. Their esti
mate* differ by more than a quarter of
a million votes; a larger margin than
would exist In a close election. Fancy
having the question of who was elected
president remain open for months after
election, and the result finally determined
by belated returns from Texas or Ken
tucky.
New Varieties of Wheat.
Among the most Important of the eg
perlments msde by the department of
agriculture are those In connection with
the cross-breeding of wheat So success
ful have they been In the production of
new varieties that scientists are inclined
to believe that the yield of wheaMn the
l'nited States with the present acreage
may ultimately be Increased to DOO.iMO.Om
bushel* g year.
The November bulletin of the bureau of
American republics discusses briefly the
result of experiments which have extend
ed over ten year* past, tn th# creating by
artlfldal mean* of new varieties of whest
which promise to give larger yields, bet
ter and stronger grains and which are
possessed of more highly nutritious prop
erties These experiments have been car
ried on st different agricultural stations,
and have been l>a»«d on the theory of th#
survival of the fittest Krom a single
grain of wheat, produced by cross-breed
ing In IM. enough s«-eJ was saved
through successive harvest a ta a< cumu
late planting seed for a five-acre tract In
D:*s The Held yielded a flne harvest if
excellent wiieal, the quality of which sur
passed all expectations.
The method followed was cine of great
are, fie seeds being planted one bj on*
and being well protected from Injurious
influen e* During lhe period of their de
velopment the pliffi were watched and
ail weak and unpromising plants re
-0 I only the Strongest and best being
lefr for the harvest The wheat thus
produ • d Is destined for distribution on
farms In different par:# of the country,
where it will be surrounded by th# same
natural conditions attending the growtn
of other wheat.
It is to be noted that some of th« wheat
grown by the stations making mesa *g-
pertinents Has yielded as high as forty
two bushels an acre, an amount which
would not be considered as excessive In
the peculiarly favored Pa louse regloir of
Eastern Washington, although It ap
proaches three times the general farm
average. The farm average for the whole
United States Is but fifteen bushels per
acre. Experiments which will result in
raising ultimately the average by any con
siderable percentage are of the greatest
value, not only to the farmers of the
United States, but to the people of the
whole world. It Is approaching the time
when the area of new land to be brought
under 'the plow, capable of producing
wheat, will be exhausted: while the aver
age annual Increase In population shows
no sign* of becoming less. Heretofore the
new area to be brought under cultivation
has kept full pace with the Increase In
population. When thl* equilibrium be
come* disturbed, the world will have
to face an annua! deficit In bread
stuffs, or measures must be taken to In
crease the productiveness of each acre de
voted to their production. Higher culti
vation. fertilising the soil and rotation of
crops will do much In that direction; and
the experiments of the department of ag
rlculture show that the creation of new
and Improved varieties of wheat may do
still more.
While the annual a\'erage of the Amer
ican wheat farms remain* at fifteen bush
el* per acre, and the highly cultivated
and heavily fertlllxed farms of Great
Britain produce as high as sixty bushels
peir acre. It Is apparent that there is a
wide margin to work on In the direction
of an Increased product long after the
remaining area of new land has all been
brought under cultivation.
A London correspondent of a Lelpslc
paper writes that he has it from a high
placed personage that, if the Boers will
surrender, England will permit them to
establish a new Boer republic In the
northern half of the Transvaa:. He does
not say whether this proposed republic Is
to be allowed to exist permanently, or
only till such time as gold Is found within
Ita borders.
John Marshall Day.
Among the recommendations In the
president'* message was one that con
grass should participate In the exercises
arranged for John Marshall day. Febru
ary 4, IWI. This recommendation is In re
sponse to the request of the American
Bfcr Association, made by resolution at
a recent meeting. February 4 next Is
the first centennial of the Installation of
the Expounder" aa, chief Justice
of the aug eme court of thfe I'nlted
States, and It is certainly fitting that the
bench and bar of the United States, ant#*
congress as well, shouid unite In appro
priately observing the day and in com
memorating the splendid career of the
great jurist whose services to the In
fant nation were among the greatest
rendered by anv one Individual; although,
necessarily, they are more highly appre
ciated by lawyers and conatltutlonal stu
dents than by laymen. Certain It Is, as
the committee of the bar association ex
pressea It, that "The science of Jurispru
dence will forever acknowledge him as
one of Its greatest benefactors. The con
stitution of the United States owes as
much to him as to any alngle mind, for
the foundations on which It rests and
the expositions by which It Is main
tained."

ments are already making for the bench
and bar of this state to celebrate appro-
priately the annlversmry In the same
manner aa It will be observed In nearly-
all of the other states and in the na-
tional capital as well.
The recommendations of the committee
are that the day be properly observ
ed on the part of all state and national
courts by the cessation of Judicial busi
ness, and that all state, city and county
bar associations participate In proper ex
ercises In such manner as shall seem to
them appropriate ceremonies art

colleges, law schools and public schools,
to the end that the youth of our country
may be made more fully acquainted with

THE PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE.
When the entire message tins been read
one leaves It with the Impression that
the president has Riven congress a great
deal of valuable Information and several
hints, but has left the matter of action
entirely In ltt< hands.—San Jose Mercury.
And let us not lose sight of the fact
that we are now calling for 100.00# troops
and spending $100,000,000 per sear to ex
tend our sway over an unwilling people
on (he other side of the globe, not to
promote liberty or peace, equality or jus
tice, but commercial expansion so-called—
that In, in order to make money for our
own porkets which there Is not the small
est prctablllty that we shall ever get.—
New York Evening Post.
Thus a notably businesslike message
closes with a patriotic utterance for econ
omy. caution, freedom, simplicity and
peace.—Brooklyn Eagle.
In the greatest range of Its topics is
conclusively shown the new place the
I'nlted States now occupies as a world
power with world-wide Interests.—Chicago
News.
It is prolix and tedious. It touches upon
almost every topic conceivable, and most
of them, If Introduced at nil, could ad
vflntageously have been treated in half
the words.—Louisville Courier-Journal.
It Is an Important and Interesting sum
mary of the history of the year so far
as It affects the United States, written
by the man who has been the most potent
factor in directing the course of our coun
try.—San Francisco Call.
His warning Is timely, for it Is always
better to be conservative before reckless
ness Is practiced than to wait until errors
have been committed.—ldaho Statesman.
The message Is a most able and states
manlike document, and. although It 1s
somewhat lengthy. It will bear careful
per mil from beginning to end.—Los
Angeles Times.
The dcctiment will live as a faithful
exposition of the affairs of the republic
at the height of what has been the
mosi prosperous period we have ever seen.
—Great Falls Leader.
In general It may be said that the
message breathes the spirit of patriotic
statesmanship which pervades all the
president's uttvr^pces.—St. Paul Pioneer
Press.
Nothing Is more Important in "le mes
sage tlilt*i the closing word* of caution.—
