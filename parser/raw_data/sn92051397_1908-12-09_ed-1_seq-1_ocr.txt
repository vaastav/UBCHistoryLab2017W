Chief Wrlnn was reported Inst even

road to recovery. Yesterday after

and seemed to he In less pain than at
any Minn since the accident last week,
when he fell rtjtt-nstal' In the dark

Dr. Wrlnn, of New York, did not come

of physicians, as has been reported,
but simply ran up for the day to see
how his father Is getting along. No
complications are now looked for, and

W ashington, Dee. S. An emergency
volunteer army was advocated to-day
by President Roosevelt In a special
message sent to congress and a draft

Cullum. The president says the hill
Is Intended to replace the present law
which was placed on the statute books
"piecemeal and hurriedly, partly on
hie eve of war with Spain and partly
after hostilities had actually com
menced." It Is pointed out by the president
that the proposed measure would not
call for a. dollar's expenditure during
Ihe years of peace and whose enact
ment Into law would merely he to
place at th" disposal of the executive
power, machinery whereby, should
war threaten, the means to wage it
could lie swiftly brought Into being.

the misfortune to be In Court street
yesterday noon, at a lime when a
Polnnder with a pleasing air, a light
suit mixed with yellow, and a cap, In
nocently wanted to know how to get
to Chicago, rickus seemed able to
give the Information, so he walked up
to him. He asked, rickus kindly In

a little a Hebrew came up. At this
Juncture the polander returned with
the Information that he did not have
enough money to get to Chicago, but
he st i ted he had security for a loan.
Pickus asked to see It and he showed
a watch. Pickus' lda of business
stifled at the thought of the watch j
so there was nothing doing.

Will Re Mayor's Appointment to

lo Hold His .lob.
Though the time for making nomin
ations for the city ofTlces Is elglil
months off, there is a great deal of
talk as to who will he iho party nom
inees and more Interest In the ques
tion than there ha been In many I
years. The discussion commenced
soon after the national election and at.
present Is occupying the attention of
everyone who Is at all Interested In
politic.
Naturally the principal Interest rests
in the question ns to who shall he the
nominees for mayor. It Is probable on
the democratic side that there will be
no one to contest the renomlnallon of
the prene.it mayor, James R Martin.
Mayor Mart'n Is a candidate for re
nomlnaMon and the member of his
party generally declare he has showed
himself an executive of unusual and
vigorous ability.
On the republican side more possi
ble nominees have been discussed
among whom are Ktate shell Commis
sioner John H. Clarke. Senator Frank
lin I.. Homsn, and Gen. 1'lieips Mont
gomery. nr whom have rensldr rr.W .. iln, endeavor to get the best ele

Whltaker, one nf the blgnest vote ge'.
ters the republican party has had hi a
number of years, excepting possibly
.lohn P. Simlley. Mr. Whitnker, If he
had his way would probably not run
for the offtco as h" Is a candidate for
county sheriff In l'.ill and his present
position Is good enough until then Huf
Mr. Whltaker Is also a pood nrganlxa
atlon man and should he he urged to
accept the mayoralty nomination, will
undoubtedly accede to the request.
Should Mr Whltaker enter the race
Senator Homan would not b a candi
date and would throw all his strength
toward the town clerk. Mr. Clarke
has the backing of Governor Woodruff
and his personal friends, rather than
that of the republican organization.
Grn. Montgomery Is not an organisa

The architect has been working on
theoe plans since the bids were upened
and has sent them out for the bidders
to change their estimates accordingly.
These new plans were gone Aver very
carefully and were quite satisfactory
to the committee, as they change no
esentlal features of the building, but

places and slightly modify the con

WIRE CORPORATION
TO EMPLOY 5,000
Preparations Made for Great
Increase of Working Force,
Which Will Be Boom
to the City.
FULL PLANS ANNOUNCED
Company to Do Operated With Vor
cester Plant nnil Will Manufac
ture Wire Ropo Ex
clusively, Definite plans for the opening of the.
National Wire company's plant In Fair
Haven were explained last night to a,
representative of this paper, which was
the flrst to announce that the big steel
works would resume operations after a
shut down of over a year and a half.
Ever since II. Stuart Hofchklss and
ex-Mayor Frederick H. Farnsworth, th
receivers of the company, wound up
Its affairs by the sale of the plant to
the American Steel Hnd,Wire company,
there had been much speculation as to
whether or not operations would he re
sumed and hundreds who had been de
pendent on the company for .work,
were appraised of the fact, through
these columns a few days ago, that
their hopes for a complete resumption
of work would soon he renli,ed. This
statement r noy followed up by a
more detailed announcement nf plans,
w hich Is If Importance to everybody In
New Haven driving the business Inter
cuts of the city at heart.
fin January I the wire corporation
will open with a force of about 3r0 or
oo men as a starter and as extensive
additions and alterations . have been
made In the nhops since th company
shut down, It Is proposed to ptendlly in
crease the force until It. numbers 4.500
nr 5.000 men, this number being three
times as larjre as that employed by the
company during the most prosperous
period to the shut down. . With nearly
5.000 drawing pay at the wire -works
Fair Haven should experience a boom
sub as the place has not felt fbr years.
The wire mill will be run In conjunc
tion with the Washburn and Moen
works of Worcester, Mass., the two
comprising what Is known as the Wor
cester district of the American Steel
and Wire corporation, otherwdse known
as the steel trust.
Wire rope will b manufactured al
most exclusively by the big Fair Haven
plant and hundreds of men familiar
with that line of work will he brought
here from out of town when the works
gets well under way.
It was Just two years ago that thfl
receivers were appointed and the com
pany was run under their directions up
to May. 190". when the plant was
closed. Almost a year later It was sold
to the ptee Trust and since that time
preparations have been steadily going
on looking toward the opening which is
now practically at hand. From an In
dustrial standpoint the opening of thft
wire works Is one of the most Impor
tant events to take place In New Ha
ven In many years.
