Washington, Dec. J. President
Roosevelt's annual message to congress
Is a voluminous document of nearly
10,000' words, by far the longest mes
sage he has ever submitted to congress.
The opening subject of the message is
the financial condition of the country,
and for which the president lays much
of the blame upon unscrupulous stock
speculators, and says:
"In any large body of men, however,
there are certain to be some who are
dishonest, and if the conditions are
such that these men prosper or com
mit their misdeeds with impunity, their
example is a very evil thing for the
community. Where these men are busi
ness men of great sagacity and of tem
perament both unscrupulous and recK
less, and where the conditions are such
that thev act without supervision or
contr.il and at first without effective
check from public opinion, they delude
manv innocent DeoDle Into making In
vestments or embarking In kinds of
business that are really unsound.
When the misdeeds of these successful
ly dishonest men are discovered, suf
fering comes not only upon them, but
upon the innocent men whom they
have misled. It is a Dalnful awakening,
whenever it occurs: and, naturally.
when it does occur those who suffer
are apt to forget that the longer it was
deferred the more painful It would be.
In the effort to punish the guilty It is
both wise and proper to endeavor so
far as nossible to minimize tne ais
tress of those who have been misled by
the guilty. Yot it is hot possible to
refrain because of such distress from
striving to put an end to the misdeeds
that are the ultimate causes of the suf
fering, and, as a means to this eno,
where possible to punish those re
sponsible for them. There may be hon
est differences of opinion as to many
governmental policies; but surely there
can be no such differences as to the
need of unflinching perseverance inthe
war against successful dishonesty."
He quotes at length from his mes
sage of last year In which he advo
cated federal control of corporations
doing Interstate business, and believes
that In such control would be found the
remedy for overcapitalization and
stock speculation which he believes
have brought about the present finan
cial conditions. He says:
"Our steady aim should be by legis
lation, cautiously and carefully under
taken, but resolutely persevered In, to
assert the sovereignty of the national
government by affirmative action.
"This is only in form an Innovation.
In substance it is merely a restoration;
for from the earliest time such regula
tion of Industrial activities has been
recognized in the action of the law
making bodies; and all that I propose
Is to meet the changed conditions In
such manner as will prevent the com
. monwealth abdicating the power It has
always possessed, not only In this coun
try, but also In England before and
since tiils country became a separate
nation.
Federal Control of
Railroads la Favored.
"No small part of the trouble that we
liavc comes from carrying to an ex
treme the national virtue of self-re
liance, of Independence In initiative
and action. It Is wise to conserve thJs
virtue and to provide for Its fullest ex
ercise, compatible with seeing that lib
erty does not become a liberty to
wrong others. Unfortunately, this is
the kind of liberty that the lack of all
effective regulation Inevitably breeds.
The founders of the constitution pro
vlded that the national government
-should have complete and sole control
of interstate commerce. There was
then practically no interstate business
save such as was conducted by water,
and this the national government at
once proceeded to regulate in thorough
froing and effective fashion. Condi
tions have now so wholly changed that
the interstate commerce by water Is In
significant compared with the amount
that goes by land, and almost all big
business concerns are now engaged In
interstate commerce. As a result. It
can be but partially and Imperfectly
controlled or regulated by the action of
any one of the several states: such ac
tion inevitably tending to be either too
drastic or else too lax, and in either
case Ineffective for purposes of justice.
Only the national government can in
thoroughgoing fashion exercise the
needed control. This docs not mean
that there should be any extension of
federal authority, for such authority
already exists under the constitution In
amplest and most far-reaching form;
but It does mean that there should be
an extension of federal activity. This
is not advocating centralization. It is
merely looking facts In the face, and
realizing that centralization in business
lias already come and can not be avoid
ed or undone, and that the public at
large can only protect Itself from cer
tain evil effects of this business cen
tralization by providing better methods
for the exercise of control through tho
authority already centralized In the
national government by the constitu
tion Itself. There must be no halt in
the healthy constructive course of ac
tton which this nation has elected to
pursue, and has steadily pursuod, dur
ins; the last six years, as shown both In
the legislation of tho congress and the
adVninlstratlon of the law by the de
partnient of Justice. Tho most vital
need Is In connection with the railroads.
As to these, in my Judgment there
should now be either a national Incor
poration act or a law licensing railway
companies to engage In Interstate com
ment upon certain conditions. The law
should be so framed as to give to the
interstate commerce commission power
to pass upon the future Issue of securi
ties, while ample means should be pro
vided to enable trie commission, when
ever in its Judgment it Is necessary, to
mnlce a physical valuation of any rail
road. As I stated In my message to the
congress a year ago, railroads should
tie given power to enter into, agree
ments, subject to tnese agreements be
ing made public In minute detail and to
the consent of the Interstate commerce
commission being first obtained. Until
the national government assumes
proper control of interstate commerce
In the exorcise of the authority it al
i ready possesses, .H will be impossibl
either to give to or to get from the
.railroads full justice. The railroads
and all other great corporations will
do well to recognise that this control
.must come; the only question is .as to
-what governmental body can mosi
-wisely exercise It, The courts will do
ternitne the limits w(thln which th
.federal autnonty can exercise It, and
there will still remain ample work
within each state for the railway com
nilsxlon of that state; and the national
Interstate commerce commission win
work In harmony with the several state
commissions, each within Its own prov
ince, to achieve the desired end.

Baalnru Caaeera Vrarcd.
"Moreover, in my judgment there should
be additional legislation looking to the
proper control of the great business con
cerns engaged la interstate business, this
control to be exercised for their own
benefit and prosperity no less than for
the protection of investors and of the
general public. Aa I have repeatedly
said In messages to congress and else
where, experience has definitely shown
not merely the unwisdom but the futility
of endeavoring to put a stop to all busi
ness combinations. Modern Industrial
conditions are such that combination Is
not only necessary but inevitable. It is
so In the world of business just as It Is
so In the world of labor, and it la as Idle
to desire to put an end to all corpora
tions, to all. big combinations of capital,
as to desire to put an end to combina
tions of labor. Corporation and labor
union alike have come to stay. Each If
properly managed Is a source of good
and not evil. Whenever In either there
Is evil, It should be promptly held to ac
count; but it should receive hearty en
couragement so long as It Is properly
managed. It is profoundly Immoral to
put or keep on the statute books a law,
nominally In the interest of public moral
ity, that really puts a premium upon
public immorality, by undertaking to
forbid honest men from doing what must
be done under modern business condi
tions, so that the law Itself provides that
Its own Infraction must be the condition
precedent upon business success. To aim
at the accomplishment of too much usu
ally means the accomplishment of too lit
tle, and often the doing of positive dam
age.
"The antitrust law should not be re
pealed; but It should be made both more
efficient and more In harmony with act
ual conditions. It should be so amended
as to forbid only the kind of combination
which does harm to the general public.
such amendment to be accompanied by,
or to be an incident of, a grant of su
pervisory power to the government over
these big corporations engaged in Inter
state business. This should be accom
panied by provision for the compulsory
publication of accounts and the subjec
tion of books and papers to the Inspec
tion of the government officials. A be
ginning has already been made for Buch
supervision by the establishment of the
bureau of corporations.
"The antitrust law should not prohibit
combinations that do no injustice to the
public, still less those the existence of
which is on the whole of benefit to the
public. But even If this feature of the
law were abolished, there would remain
as an equally objectionable feature the
difficulty and delay now Incident to its
enforcement. The government must now
submit to Irksome and repeated delays
before obtaining a final decision of the
courts upon proceedings Instituted, and
even a favorable decree may mean an
empty victory. Moreover, to attempt to
control these corporations by lawsuits
means to Impose upon both the depart
ment of justice and the courts an im
possible burden; It is not feasible to carry
on more than a limited number of such
suits. Such a law to be really effective
must of course be administered by an
executive body, and not merely by moans
of lawsuits. The design should be to
prevent the abuses Incident to the crea
tion of unhealthy and improper combina
tions, instead of waiting until they are
In existence and then attempting to do
stroy them by civil or criminal proceed
ings.
Investing; Public Should
Be Amply Snfegiinrded.
"The congress has tho power to charter
corporations to engage In interstate and
foreign commerce, and a general law can
be enacted under the provisions of which
existing corporations could take out fed
eral charters and new federal corpora
tions could be created. An essential pro
vision of such a law should be a method
of predetermining by some federal board
or commission whether the applicant for
federal charter was an association or
combination within the restrictions of the
federal law. Provision should also be
made for complete publicity In all matters
affecting the public and complete protec
tion to the Investing public and the share
holders In the matter of Issuing corporate
securities. If an incorporation law is not
deemed advisable, a license act for big
Interstate corporations might bo enacted
or a combination of the two might be
tried. The supervision established might
be analogous to that now exercised over
national banks. At least, the antitrust
act should be supplemented by specific
prohibitions of the methods which ex
perience has shown have been of most
service In enabling monopolistic combina
tions to crush out competition. The real
owners of a corporation should be com
pelled to do business in their own name.
The rigt to hold stock In other corpora
tions shalild heareafter be denied to Inter
state corporations, unless on approval by
the proper government officials, and a
prerequisite to such approval should be
the listing with the government of all
owners and stockholders, both by the
corporation owning such stock and by
the corporations In which such stock Is
owned.
"To confer upon the national govern
ment. In connection with the amendment
I advocate In the antitrust law, power of
supervision over big business concerns
engaged In Interstate commerce, would
benefit them as It has benefited the na
tional banks. In the recent business
crisis It is noteworthy that the Institu
tions which failed were Institutions
which were not under the supervision and
control of the national government.
Those which were under national con
trol stood the test.
National control of the kind above ad
vocated would be to the benefit of every
well-managed railway. From the stand
point of the public there is need for ad
ditional tracks, adltlonal terminals, and
improvements in the actual handling of
the railroads, and all this as rapidly as
possible. Ample, safe, and speedy trans
portation facilities arc even more neces
sary than cheap transportation. There
fore, there is need for the investment of
money which will provide for all these
things while at the same time securing as
fas as Is possible better wages and
shorter hours for their employes. There
fore, while there must be Just and rea
sonable regulation of rates, wo should be
the first to protest against any arbitrary
and unthinking movement to cut them
down without the fullest and mo3t care
ful consideration of all interests con
cerned and of the actual needs of the
situation. Only a special body of mon
acting for the national government un
der authority conferred upon It by the
congress Is competent to pass judgment
on such a matter.
Greater Elasticity In
Currency Is Urge.
The president quotes extensively from
his last message In dealing with the di
rect subject of currency legislation, and
wealthy men, or men who pose as such,
or are unscrupulously or foolishly eager
to become such. Indulge In reckless spec
ulationespecially if it Is accompanied by
dishonesty they Jeopardize not only their
own future but the future of all their in
nocent fellow-cltisens, for they expose
the whole business community to panic
and distress."
He advises against any general tariff
legislation this session of congress, and
says:
"In a country of such phenomenal
growth as ours It Is probably well that
every dozen years or so the tariff laws
should be carefully scrutinized so as to
see that no excessive or Improper bene
fits are conferred thereby, that proper
revenue Is provided, and that our
foreign trade is encouraged. There
must always be as a minimum
a tariff which will not only al
low for the collection of an ample rev
enue but which will at least make
good the difference in cost of production
here and abroad; that Is, the difference In
the labor cost here and abroad, tor the
well-being of the wage-worker must ever
be a cardinal point of American policy.
Tho question should be approached pure
ly from a business standpoint; botn tne
time and the manner of the change being
such as to arouse the minimum of agi
tation and disturbance In the business
world, and to give the least play for
selfish and factional motives. The sole
consideration should be to see that the
sum total of changes represent the pub
lic good. This means that the subject
cannot with wisdom be dealt with In the
year preceding a presidential election, be
cause as a matter of fact experience has
conclusively shown that at such a time
It Is impossible to get men to treat It from
the standpoint of the public good. In my
Judgment the wise time to deal with the
matter Is Immediately after such election."
He asks for the repeal of the tariff on
paper and wood pulp.
He reviews and enlarges upon his pre
vious recommendations for the enact
ment of federal inheritance and Income
tax laws.
Attention Is called to the prosecution of
wealthy offenders against the national
laws, and In this connection he asks that
the laws under which these prosecutions
public opinion would probably bars
brought about prompt adjustment
"It Is idle to hold that without good
laws evils such as child labor, as the
over-working of women, as the fail
ure to protect employes from loss of
life or limb, can be effectively reached,
any more than the evils of rebates and
stock-watering can be reached without
good laws. To fall to stop these prac
tices by legislation means to force
honest men into them, because other
wise the dishonest who surely will
take advantage of them will have
everything their own way. If the states
will correct these evils, well and good;
but the nation must stand ready to aid
them.
When the department of agriculture
was founded there was much sneering as
to its usefulness. No department of the
government, however, has more em
phatically vindicated Its usefulness, and
none save the post office department
comes so continually and intimately Into
touch with the people. The two citizens
whose welfare Is in the aggregate most
vital to the welfare of the nation, and
therefore to the welfare of all other citl
zens, are the wage-worker who does
manual labor and the tiller of the soil,
the farmer. There are, of course, kinds
of labor where the work must be purely
mental, and there are other kinds of
labor where, under existing conditions,
very little demand Indeed Is made upon
the mind, though I am glad to Bay mat
the proportion of men engaged in this
kind of work Is diminishing. But in any
community with the solid, healthy quali
ties which make up a really great nation
the bulk of the people should do work
which calls for the exercise of both body
and mind. Progress can not permanently
exist in the abandonment of physical
labor, but In the development of physical
labor, so that It shall represent more and
more the work of the trained mind In the
trained body. Our school system Is
gravely defective in so far as It it puts a
premium upon mere literary training and
tends therefore to train the boy away
from the farm and the workshop. Noth
ing is more needed than the best type of
industrial school, the school lor me
chanical Industries In the city, the school
for practically teaching agriculture In the
country. The calling of the skilled tiller
are brought be strengthened and made of the soil, the calling of the skilled me-
more definite.
A few years ago there was loud com
plaint that the law could not be Invoked
against wrealthy offenders. There Is no
such complaint now. The course of the
department of justice during the last
few years has been such as to make It
evident that no man stands above the
law, that no corporation Is so wealthy
that it cannot be held to account. The
department of justice has been as
prompt to proceed against the wealthiest
malefactor whose crime was one of greed
and cunning as to proceed against the
agitator who Incites to brutal violence.
Everything that can be done under the
existing law, and with the existing state
of public opinion, which so profoundly
Influences both the courts and juries, has
been done. But the laws themselves need
strengthening In more than one tmpol
chanlc. should alike be recognized as
professions, Just as emphatically as the
callings of lawyer, doctor, merchant, or
clerk. The schools should recognize this
fact and It should be equally recognized
In popular opinion. The young man who
has the farsightedness and courage to
recognize It and get over the Idea tnai
it makes a difference whether what he
earns is called salary or wages, and who
refuses to enter the crowded neia 01 tne
so-called nrofesslons. and takes to con
structive Industry instead, Is reasonably
sure of an amDle reward In earnings, in
health, in onnortunity to marry early,
and to establish a home with a fair
amount of freedom from worry. It
should be one of our prime objects to put
both the farmer and the mechanic on a
higher plane of efficiency and reward, so
as to Increase their effectiveness In the
tant point; they should be made moro economic world, and therefore the dlg-
definito, so that no honest man can be
led unwittingly to break them, and so
that the real wrongdoer can be readily
punished.
Moreover, there must be the public
opinion back of the laws or the laws
themselves will be of no avail. At pres
ent, while the average juryman undoubt
edly wishes to see trusts broken up, and
is quite ready to fine the corporation
Itself, he Is very reluctant to find the
facts proven beyond a reasonable doubt
when it comes to sending to Jail a mem
ber of the business community for in
dulging in practices which are profound
ly unhealthy, but which, unfortunately,
the business community has grown to
recognize as well-nigh normal. Both the
present condition of the law and the
present temper of Juries render it a task
of extreme difficulty to get at the real
wrongdoer in any case, especially by Im
prisonment. Yet it Is from every stand
point far proferable to punish the prime
offender by imprisonment rather than to
fine the corporation, with the attendant
damage to stockholders.
Tho two great evils in the execution of
our criminal laws to-day are sentimen
tality and technicality. For the latter
the remedy must come from the hands
of tho legislatures, the courts and the
laywers. The other must depend for Its
cure upon the gradual growth of a sound
public opinion which Bhall Insist that re
gard for the law and the demands of
reason shall control all other influences
and emotions In the jury box. Both of
these evils must be removed or public
discontent with the criminal law will con
tinue.
says:
I again urge on tho congress the need
of immediate attention to this matter.
We need a greater elasticity In our cur
rency; provided, of course, that we rccog-
nlzo the even greater neon ot a safe and
secure currency. There must always be
the most rigid examination by the na
tional authorities. Provision should be
made for an emergency currency. The
emergency issue should, of course, be
made with an effective guaranty, and up
on conditions carefully proscribed by the
government. Such emergency issue, must
be based on adequate securities approved
by tho government, and must be issued
under a heavy tax. This would permit
currency being Issued when the demand
for It was urgent, while securing its re
tirement as the demand fell off. It is
worth Investigating to detormlne whether
officers and directors of national banks
should ever be allowed to loan to them
selves. Trust companies should be sub
1ect to the same supervision as banks:
legislation to this effect should be en
acted for the District of Columbia and
the territories.
"Yet we must also remember that even
the wisest legislation on the subject can
only accomplish a certain amount. No
legislation can by any possibility guar
antee the business community against the
results of speculative folly any more than
It can guarantee an Individual against the
results of his extravagance, when an In
dividual mortgages his house to buy an
automobile he Invites disaster; and when
The Use and the
Abnne of Injunctions.
"Instances of abuse In the granting of
injunctions In labor disputes continue to
occur, and the resentment In the minds
of those who feel that their rights are
befjig Invaded and their liberty of action
aifi of speech unwarrantably restrained
continues to grow. Much of the attack
on the use of the process of Injunction Is
wholly without warrant; but I am con
strained to express the belief that for
some of It there 1b warrant. This ques
tion Is becoming more and more of prime
importance, ana unless tne courts will
themselves deal with It In effective man
ner, It Is certain ultimately to demand
somo form of legislative action. It would
be most unfortunate for our social wel
fare If we should permit many honest
and law-abiding citizens to feel that
they had Just cause for regarding our
courts with hostility. I earnestly com
mend to the attention of the congress
this matter, so that some way may be
devised which will limit the abuse of In
junctions and protect those rights which
from time to time it unwarrantably In
vades. Moreover, discontent Is often ex
pressed with the use of the process of
Injunotlon by the courts, not only In la
bor disputes, but where state laws are
concerned. I refrain from discussion of
this question as I am informed that it
will soon receive the consideration of the
supreme court."
Of other legislation In the Interest of
labor he favors federal inspection of rail
roads; providing limited but definite com
pensation for accidents to all workmen
employed In any way by the government.
and says:.
"The constitutionality of tho employers'
liability act passed by the preceding con
gress has been carried before the courts,
In two jurisdictions the law has been de
clared unconstitutional, and In three juris
dictions its constitutionality has been af
firmed. The question has been carried to
tne supreme court, the case has been
heard by that tribunal, and a decision Is
expected at an early date. In the event
that the court should affirm the consti
tutionality of the act, I urge further leg
islation along tne lines advocated in my
message to the preceding congress. The
practice of putting the entire burden of
loss of life or limb upon the victim or
tne victim's family Is a form of Boclal in
justice in which the United States stands
In unenviable prominence. In both our
federal and our state legislation we have,
with few exceptions, scarcely gone
farther than the repeal of the fellow
servant principle of the old law of liabil
ity, and in some of our states even this
slight modification of a complete out
grown principle has not yet been secured."
Ho favors the extension of the eight-
hour law to all departments of the gov
ernment, and to- all work carried on by
the government, tie urges legislation
for the compulsory investigation of In
dustrial disputes, and says:
"The need for some provision for such
Investigation was forcibly illustrated
during tho past summer. A strike of
telegraph operators seriously Interfered
with telegrapmc communication, caus-
lng great damage to business Interests
and serious inconvcnlenco to the gen
eral public. Appeals were made to me
from many parts of the country, from
eiiv councils, irom Doaras of trade
from chambers of commerce, and from
labor organizations, urging that steps
he taken to terminate tne strike.
TCvervthlng that could with any nro-
prloty be done by a representative of
the government was done without avail,
and for weeks the public stood by and
suffered Without recourse of any kind.
Had the machinery existed and, had
there been , authority for compulsory
Investigation of the dispute, the public
would have been placed In possession
of th merits of the controversy, and
nity, tho remuneration, and the power of
their positions in the social world.
Inland Waterway Systems
Should Be Dcevlopcd.
The conservation of our national re
sources and their proper use constitute
the fundamental problem which under
lies almost every other problem of our
national life. Wo must maintain for
our civilization the adequate material
basis without which that civilization
cannot exist. Wo must show foresight,
we must look ahead. As a nation we
not only enjoy a wonderful measure of
nresent prosperity but If this prosper
lty Is used aright it Is an earnest of
future success such as no other nation
will have. The reward of foresight fot
this nation is great and easily foretold,
But there must be the look ahead,
there must be a realization of the fact
that to waste, to destroy, our natural
resources, to skin and exhaust the land
instead of using it so as to increase its
usefulness, will result In undermining
In the days of our children the very
prosperity which we ought by right to
hand down to them amplified and aevei
oped. For the last few years, through
Beveral agencies, the government has
been endeavoring to get our people to
look ahead and to substitute a planned
and orderly development of our re
sources In plaoe of a haphazard striv
ing for immediate profit. Our great
river systems should be developed as
national water highways; the Missis
slppl, with its tributaries, standing first
In importance, and the Columbia sec
ond, although there are many others of
Importance on the Pacific and Atlantio
and the gulf slopes. The national gov
ernment should undertake this work,
and I hope a beginning will be made
In the present congress; and the great
est of all our rivers, the Mississippi
should receive especial attention. From
the Oreat Lakes to the mouth of the
Mississippi there should be a deep wa
terway, with deep waterways leading
from it to the east and the west. Such
a waterway would practically mean
the extension of our coast line Into the
very heart of our country. It; would be
of Incalculable benefit to our people. If
begun at once It can be carried through
In time appreciably to relieve the con
gestion of our great freight-carryin;
lines of railroads. The work should be
systematically and continuously carried
forward in accordance with some well
conceived plan. The main streams
should be Improved to the highest
point of efficiency before the Improve
ment of the branches is attempted; and
the work should be kept free from
every taint of recklnssness or Jobbery.
Attention is caiiedito tne work or ir
rigation and reclamation of govern
ment lands. In the same connection he
asks for a revision of the public land
laws along the lines proposed by the
publlo lands commission. Believes the
government should Increase Its efforts
to conserve our forests and should In
crease by purchase tho existing forest
preserves. On the subject of the natural
resources of the nation he says:
"In the eastern United States the
mineral fuels have already passed Into
the hands of large private owners, and
those of the west are rapidly following.
It Is obvious that these fuels should be
conserved and not wasted, and It would
be well to protect the people against
unjust and extortionate prices, so far
as that can still be done. What has
been accomplished In the great oil
fields of the Indian Territory by the
action of the administration offers a
striking example of the good results
of such a policy. In my Judgment the
government should have the right to
keep tho fee of the coal, oil and gas
fields in Its own possession and to lease
the rights to develop them-' under
proper regulations; or else, if the con
gress will not adopt this method, the
coal deposits should be sold under lim
itations, to conserve them as public
utilities, the right to mine coal being
separated from the title to tho soil.
The regulations should permit coal
lands to be worked In sufficient quan
tity by the several corporations. The
present limitations have been absurd,
excessive, and serve no useful purpose,
and often render it necessary that
there should be either fraud or else
abandonment of tho work of getting
out the coal." .
Progress of the Work

"Work on the Panama canal Is pro
ceeding in a highly satisfactory man

yards. In April this was Increased to

that the rains are a less serious ob

"Last winter bids were requested and
received for doing the work of canal
construction by contract. None of them
was found to be satisfactory and all
were rejected. It la - the unanimous
opinion of the present commission that
the work can be done better, more
cheaply, and more quickly by the gov
ernment than by private contractors.
Fully 80 per cent, of the entire plant
needed for construction has been pur
chased or contracted for; machine
shops have been erected and equipped
for making all needed repairs to the
plant; many thousands of employes
have been secured; an effective organi
zation has been perfected; a recruiting
system Is In operation which is capable
of furnishing more labor than can be
used advantageously; employes are
well sheltered and well ted; salaries
paid are satisfactory, and the work is
not only going forward smoothly, but
It Is producing results far In advance
of the most sanguine -anticipations.
Under these favorable conditions, a
change In the method of prosecuting
the work would be unwise and unjusti
fiable, for It would inevitably disorgan
ize existing conditions, check progress,
and Increase the cost and lengthen the
time of completing the canal.
President Recommends
Postal Savings Banks.
'I commend to the favorable consid
eration ot the congress a postal sav
ings bank system, as recommended by
the postmaster general. The primary
object is to encourage among our peo
ple economy and thrift and by the use
of postal savings banks to give them
an opportunity to husband their re
sources, particularly those who have
not the facilities at band for depositing
their money, in savings banks. Viewed,
however, from the experience of the
past few weeks, it Is evident that the
advantages of such an Institution are
still more far-reaching. Timid depos
tors have withdrawn their savings for
the time being from national banks; In
dividuals have hoarded their cash and
the workingmen their earnings; all
of which money has been withdrawn
and kept In hiding or In the safe de
posit box to the detriment of pros
perlty. Through tho agency of the pos
tal savings banks such money would be
restored to the channels of trade, to
the mutual benefit of capital and labor.
"I further commend to the congress
the consideration of the postmaster
generals recommendation for an ex
tension of the parcel post, especially on
the rural routes. There are now ds,-
215 rural routes, serving nearly 15,000,
000 people who do not have the ad
vantages of the Inhabitants of cities In
obtaining their supplies. These recom
mendations have bcon drawn up to
benefit the farmer and the country
storekeeper; otherwise, I should not
favor them, for I believe that it Is good
policy for our government to do every
thing possible to aid the small town
and the country district It is desirable
that the country merchant should not
be crushed out.
"The fourth-class postmasters' con
vention has passed a very strong reso
lution in favor of placing the fourth
class postmasters under the clvll-serv-Ice
law. The administration has al
ready put Into effect the policy of re
fusing to remove any fourth-class post
masters save for reasons connected
with the good of the service; and It Is
endeavoring so far as possible to re
move them from the domain of partisan
politics. It would be a most desirable
thing to put the fourth-class postmas
ters In the classified service."

Corporation Contributions
to Compalgn Expenses.
"Under our form of government" voting
Is not merely a right but a duty, and,
moreover, a fundamental and necessary
duty If a man is to be a good citizen.
It Is well to provide that corporations
shall not contribute to presidential or
national campaigns, and furthermore to
provide for the publication of both con
tributions and expenditures. There la,
however, always danger in laws of this
kind, which from their very nature are
difficult of enforcement; the danger being
lest they be obeyed only by the honest,
ana aisooeyea oy tne unscrupulous, so
as to act only as a penalty upon honest
men. Moreover, no such law would ham
per an unscrupulous man of unlimited
means from buying his own way Into of
fice. There is a very radical measure
which would, I believe, work a substan
tial improvement in our system of con
ducting a campaign, although I am well
aware that It will take some time for
people to so familiarize themselves with
such a proposal as to be willing to con
sider Its adoption. The need for collect
ing large campaign funds would vanish li
congress proviaod an appropriation for
the proper and legitimate expenses of
each of the great national parties, an ap
propriation ample enough to meet the
necessity for thorough organization and
machinery, which requires a large ex
penditure of money. Then the stipula
tion should be made that no party re
ceiving campaign funds from the treasury
should accept more than a fixed amount
from any Individual subscriber or donor;
and the necessary publicity for receipts
and expenditures could without difficulty
do proviaeu.
Wants Improvement In the
Ocean Mall Service,
"I call your especial attention to thA im.
satisfactory condition of our foreign mail
service, which, because of the lack of
American steamship lines, Is now largely
done through foreign linos, and which,
particularly so far as South and Centra!
America aro concerned, is done In a man
ner which constitutes a serious barrier
to the extensions of our commerce.
The time has come, In my Judgment
to set to work seriously to make our
ocean mall service correspond more
closely with our rocont commercial and
political ooveiopmcnt. a beginning was
made by the ocean mail act of March 3,
15-ji, out, evuu ul umv time me act was
known to be Inadequate In various par
ticulars. Since that time events have
moved rapidly in our history. Wo have
acquired Hawaii, the Philippines, and
lesser Islands In the Pacific. We are
steadily prosecuting the great' work of
uniting at the Isthmus tho waters of the
Atlantic and the Pacific. To a greater
extent (.nan seem prooabiy even a
dozen years ago we may look to an
American futuro on the sea worthy of
the tradition of our past. As tho first
step In that direction, and the step most
feasible at the present time, I rocommend
tho extension of the ocean mall act of
1891. That act has stood for some years
free from successful criticism of Its prln
c'plo and purpose. It was based on theo
ries of the obligations of a groat mari
time nation, undisputed In our own land
and followed by other nations slnco the
beginning of steam naylgatlon. Briefly
those theories are, that it Is the duty of
a first-class power so far as practicable
to carry its ocean malls under Its own
Hag; that the fast ocean steamships and
their crews, required for such mall serv
ice, are valuable auxiliaries to the sea
power of a nation. Furthermore, the
construction ot such steamships insures
the maintenance la on afflulaiit condition
of the shipyards in which our battleships
must be built
Asks Iacreaia fn Pay -
for Arm r Officers and Mesu
The president devotes much space t
the affairs ot the army, and strongly
urges that our regular military organi
zation be kept up to the highest possible
standard of efficiency, and says:
'The medical corps should be much
greater than the needs of our regular
army In war. Yet at present It la small
er than the needs of the service demand
even In peace. The Spanish war oc
curred less than ten years ago. The
chief loss we suffered In It was by dis
ease among the regiments which never
left the country. At the moment the
nation seemed deeply impressed by this
fact; yet seemingly it has already been
forgotten, . for not the- slightest effort
has been made to prepare a medical
corps of sufficient size to prevent the
repetition of the same disaster- on a
much larger scale If we should ever be
engaged in a -serious conflict.
But the medical department Is not ths
only department for which increased pro
vision should be made. The rate of pay
for the officers should be greatly In
creased; there is no higher type of citizen
than the American regular officer, and he
should have a fair reward for his ad
mirable work. There should be a rela
tively even greater increase in the pay for
the enlisted men. An especial provision
should be made for establishing grades
equivalent to those of warrant officers In
the navy, which should be open to the
enlisted men who serve sufficiently long
and who do their work well. Inducements
should be offered sufficient to encourage
really good men to make the army a Ufa
occupation. The prime needs of our pres
ent army is to secure and retain compe
tent noncommissioned officers. This diffi
culty rests fundamentally on the ques
tion of pay. The noncommissioned officer
does not correspond with an unskilled la
borer; he corresponds to the best type of
skilled workman or to the subordinate
official In civil Institutions. Wages have
greatly Increased In outside occupations
In the last 40 years and the pay of the
soldier, like the pay of the officers, should
be proportionately Increased. The first
sergeant of a company, if a good man,
must be one of such executive and aa-
mlnlstrative ability, and such knowledge
of. his trade, as to be worth far more than
we at present pay him. The same is true
of the regimental sergeant major. These
men should be men who had fully re
solved to make the army a life occupa
tion and they should be able to look for
ward to ample reward; while only men
properly qualified should be given a
chance to secure these final rewards. The
Increase over the present nay need not
be great In the lower grades for tho first
one or two enlistments, , but the increase
should be marked for the noncommis
sioned officers of the upper grades who
serve long enough to make It evident that
they Intend to stay permanently in the
armv. while additional pay should be
given for high qualifications in target
practice.
"Among the officers there shonld be
severe examinations to weed out the
unfit up to the grade of major. From
that position on appointments should
be solely by selection and It should be
understood that a man of merely av
erage capacity could never get beyond
the position of major, while every man
who serves In any grade a certain
length of time prior to promotion to
the next grade without getting the
promotion to the next grade should be
forthwith retired."
President Sees Need of
Largely Increased Navy.
The president asks for a continuous
Increase in the navy, and asks present
ennorress for appropriations for four
new battleships, and says:
"We need always to remember that
in time of war the navy is not to be
used to defend harbors and sea-coast
cities: we should perfect our system of
coast fortifications. The only efficient
use for the navy Is for offense. The
only way in which It can efficiently pro
tect our own coast against the possible
action of a foreign navy is ny destroy
ine that foreign navy. For defense
against a hostile fleet which actually
attacks them, the coast cities must de
pend upon their forts, mines, torpedoes,
submarines and torpedo boats and de
stroyers. All of these together are er-
flclent for defensive purposes, dui iney
in no wav supply the plaoe of a thor
nuirhlv efficient navy capable of acting
on the offensive; for parrying never yet
won a fight. It can only De won Dy
hard hitlng. and an aggressive sea-going
navy alone can do this hard hitting
of the offensive type. But the forts
and the like are necessary so that the
navv may be footloose. In time of war
there Is sure to be demand, under pres
sure of fright, for the ships to De scat-
torAd so as to defend all kind 01 ports.
Under penalty of terrible disaster, this
demand must be refused. The ships
must he kent together, and their ob
jective made the enemies' fleet. If
fortifications are sufficiently strong, no
modern navy will venture to attack
them, so long as the foe has In exist
ence a hostile navy of anything like
the same size or efficiency. But unless
there exists such a navy then the forti
fications are powerless by themselves
to secure the victory. For of course
the mere deficiency means that any
resolute enemy can at his leisure com
bine all his forces upon one point with
the certainty that ho can take It,

to have thorn practice under similar

the only way to find out our actual
