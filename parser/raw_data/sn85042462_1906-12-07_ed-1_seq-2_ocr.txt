wen- arraigned in Superior Dunne's
court.
At tha urgent request of counsel for
Hi' di tense the case was continued
until next Monday for the purpose of
Rlvlriß the accused further timo In
which to plead,
a dratnatlo srene was presented in
the court room ;is Mayor Schmil/. uml
Mr. nu.'i appeared before tit-- bar.
No. 108. Eugene D. Bchmlta mid
Abraham Huef, for arraignment,"
.Turtle Dunne announced as be took his
sent on the bench.
"A breathless silence like a pull fell
on the auditors as the mayor aroM and
faced the clerk. He listened atten
tively us the words of the formal In
dictment fell from the lips of the clerk
in monotonous monotones. Ruef de
clined to m-lse until the third Indict
ment was read and then only after
he had been commanded to do by the
judge.
Judge Dunne was some minutes late
In reaching the court room. The de
fendants and the attorneys were in
their seats awaiting his oomlng when
he finally emerged from chambers. Two
minor cases were disposed of nnd then
the names of Hehmitz and Ruef were
called. Attorney John Barrett an
swered ready for the, mayor, while
Hfiiry Ach performed a similar office
for Ruef.
"Let the arraignment proceed," di
rected the judge.
Ruef Remains Seated
Clerk McMnnuH handed copies of the
indictment to the. attorneys. The
mayor arose from his chair, but lUief
remained seated. The clerk had
scarcely finished with the title of the
court and cause when Assistant Dis
trict Attorney Heney interrupted:
"I would like to know if both the de
fendants are being arraigned?" ho
asked.
Ach answered in the affirmative.
"It Is strange," retorted Heney. "I
only see one of them standing."
"It is not necessary for the defend
ant to stand," interjected Attorney
Barrett.
Ruef made no offer to arise and the
judge did not force him to leave his
chair.
When the formality was over the
clerk asked the true names of the
defendants. The mayor replied "Eu
gene E. Schmitz" and Ruef •"Abraham
Ruef."
The mayor took his seat and his at
torney, Frank Drew, asked for a con
tinuance until Monday to answer the
Indictment.
Continuance Denied
"It was undestood," replied the
Judge, "at the last calling of the case
that the answer should be made today.
The motion for a continuance is de
nied."
"But, your honor," protested Mr.
Barrett, "the reason that your honor
would not consent to let these cases
stand over until Monday was because
we could not give an assurance that
we woudl answer upon that day."
"Before we proceed with this discus
sion," said Judge Dunne, apparently
annoyed, " I think that the arraign
ment should proceed with the other in
dictments."
The clerk read the second indict
ment. No. 304, on the old calendar, but
when he had finished Assistant District
Attorney Heney observed that he had
failed to ask for the defendants' plea.
"Why don't you ask for their plea?"
he said to the clerk.
"I thought," the clerk replied, "that
they were only to be arraigned today."
Like Ordinary Prisoners
"How can you arraign them if you
do not ask for their plea?" Heney de
manded, and then addressing the court
said: "I think, your honor. If this
ralgnment was conducted in the same
way as that of an ordinary prisoner,
there would be less confusion. Why do
tiiey not stand up so they can be iden
tified?"
"I asked the clerk," Judge Dunne re
plied, "why he has not required the
prisoners to .stand. He says that the
attorneys have some objection. I think
myself that they should stand. They
will be treated no differently in this
court than if they were John Smith or
any other prisoner. The arraignment
will proceed and the prisoners must
stand."
The clerk read the remaining throe
indictments with Ruef gazing into
space and the mayor still listening at
tentively. At the conclusion of each
Attorney Barrett repeated his motion
for 8 continuance until Monday, but
the judge paid no heed to the request
until the arraignment had been con
cluded. After considerable quibbling
as to the date for pleading Judge
Dunne said:
"I am inclined to think that the de
fendants should have until Monday
morning, anrl the case is continued
until that time with the understanding
that they will then be ready to an
swer."

Appropriations on a
Large Scale
By Assoclalod Press
WASHINGTON, Dec. 6.— The appro
priation by congress of at least $[iO,
00,000 nun. for the Improvement
of the rivers and' harbors of the coun
try .was .the keynote of the speeches
delivered before the National Rivers
mid Harbors convention "which as
sembled hero today for a two days'
session.
Addresses ■ ere made at the morning
session by Speaker Cannon and Theo
dore E. Burton, chairman of the houses
committee on rivers and harbors.
Speaker Cannon warned the dele
gates not to expect too much from
congress, "for," he said, "too much
cannot be done nt one time. Do the
most Important thing first and con
centrate upon it and then take up the
next most important thing."
Mr. Burton said that the convention
should not ask for an appropriation
from congress for any particular com
munity, but for the greater projects
of the country. He thought less
should be spent on the navy and more
for Improvement of the rivers and
harbors of the country.
At the afternoon session speeches
were made by John Barrett, American
minister to Colombia; J. N. Teal of
Portland, Ore., Ex-Senator Berry, of
Arkansas and others.

"It shall be the duty of the board to
prosecute the work of securing regular
and Increased annual appropriations
for internal water-way Improvements of
the country without regard to particu
lar : localities or projects, . and >to aid
in the infolding of ' public sentiment
ln favor of such a movement. . , .
"The board is further charged with
the duty of increasing membership in
the congress of trade, commercial and
waterway - associations, corporations,
firms and individuals."

The Jiji is grateful that President
Roosevelt has expressed exactly what
the Japanese would sny. "They feel
at ease," it declares, "since the Japan
ese cause has been placed in such a
powerful hand."
The press is almost unanimous in
confidently expressing a satisfactory
solution of the San Francisco com
plications.
French Praise Message
By Associated Press.
PARIS. Dec 6.— A1l the French
newspapers today publish editorials on
President Roosevelt's message, unani
mously selecting for comment his re
marks upon the Japanese situation as
being "most characteristic of the
man," and praising tho president's
courage.
The general opinion can be summed
up In the words of the Petit Repub
lique as follows: "His presentation of
the Japanese question was an eloquent
feature of his addreßS. It constitutes
a lesson in international polltenet-s ai>d
shows that in order for a nation to
have the right to insist on tho proper
treatment of its subjects abroad, it is
necessary to begin according similar
treatment to foreigners at home. The
president lias spoken with courage, re
gardless of popularity. ■ Ho has per
formed his duty as an American and
as <*hief of state."
Board Stands by Its Course
By Associated Press
SAN FRANCISCO, Dec. 6.— The San
Francisco board of education will
stand by its decision to confine the
Jupanesu school children to the Ori
ental school.
The sentiments of President Roose
velt, as expressed in his messago to
congress, will not affect its position,
according to President Altman, on the
board, who announced today that the
board will do all in its power to"cor
rect the impression given out by the
president's message which says that
the, Japanese are excluded from the
San Francisco public schools.
Great Chance for American Publishers
PARIS, France, Dec. 6. — It Is
stated here that the Mergentlialor Lino
type company of New York, through
its Purls office, is offering its lat
est style Linotype machine to French
publishers at tremendously low prices,
equal to discounts from 30 per cent to
606 0 per cent below the prices charged to
American publishers In the United
States. This is a grand opportunity for
American publishers to purchase Amer
ican made Mergenthulers through
French publishers and reimport them
to Ihe United States, as returned manu
factures are not subject to duty. The
reuson stated for the Linotype war in
France at the present time li that it is
part of a plan of the. American Mer
geuthaler company to endeavor to force
the German, English and Canadian
linotype companies into a territorial
agreement giving the American com
pany the. entire field of the American
continent. This is deemed necessary by
the American company in view or the
fact that Its patents upon the single
letter standard linotype machines ex
pire In the I'ult'-ii'Htuti In September
next. if the American company sue
ceeds In forcing an agreement as out
lined, then the American publishers will
bc left in the clutches of the Mergen
thaler company of New York for yean,
but if it does not succeed than the
German, English and Canadian com
panies will be offering their machines
in the United States next September,
when there is no doubt the prices of
linotype machine* will come down with
a crash. It seems as If it would pay
the American publishers to either get
their liutotypc machine* through
French sources m- withhold their ordem
until after next September and see
what turns up. ,
