against the Oovernment and the peo
ple of the United States of America.
Therefore be It
Vr solved. By the Hennte and House
of Representatives of the United States
of America In Congress assembled,
that ft state of war Is hereby declared
to exist between the United States of
America and the Imperial nnd Koyal
Atistro-Hungarlan Government ; and
that the President be, and he Is hereby,
authorized and directed to employ the
entire naval and military forces of tho
United States and the resources of the
Oovernment to carry on war against
the Imperial and Hoyal Austro. Hun
garian llovernment: and to bring the
ronfllct to n successful termination all
tho resources of the country are
hereby pledged by the Cdngress of the
United States.
House Committee Report,
The report of the House Foreign Af
talis Committee begins by stating the
text of the war resolution as perfected
yesterday, and then goes on :
The President has asked for the
declaration that a state of war exists
against Austria-Hungary. In his ad
dress, delivered nt the Joint session of
the two houses of Congress on Decem
ber 4, he uses this language:
"One very embarrassing, obstacle
that stands In our way is that we are
nt war with Germany, but not with
her allies. I therefore ery earnestly
recommend that tho Congress Im
mediately declare the United States In '
a state of war with Austria-Hungary."
The accompanying resolution carries
out this recommendation of the Presi
dent. The enactment of this declara
tion Involves very little readjustment
of the affairs between the United
States and Austria-Hungary' because
a state of war which this declaration
declares to exist actually has been a
fact for many months. The depreda
tions on American lives and rights by
Austrian naval forces have been small
compared with that of Germany, but
they liavo been Indulged In to an ex
tent to constitute war upon this, coun
try, nnd this fac!, taken in connection
with other acta of Austria-Hungary,
has more and more brought that Gov
ernment Into a position where the
American people have realized that
she must be Included with Germany
as an enemy.
3tr!l:e Were Fomented.
In September, IMS, It was discov
ered that Ambassador Dumba nnd
Austrian Consuls In St. Louis and else
where were Implicated In Instigating
striken In American manufacturing
plants engaged In the production of
munition of war. An American citi
zen named Archibald, travelling under
an American pastrr.ort had been en
trusted with despatches In regard to
this matter from Dumba and Rern
storff to their Governments. These
acts wero admitted by Dumba, By
rear-on of the admitted purpose nd
tntciit of Dumba to consplrp to cripple
business Industries ' In the United
States and by reason of the flagrant
violation of diplomatic propriety in
employing an American citizen, pro
tected by an American passport, as a
serret bearer of official despatches
through the lines of an enemy of
Austria-Hungary, the Austro-Hunga-rlan
Government was requested to re
call Dumba.
The Austrian Consuls nt St. Louis
nnd New York were Implicated with
Dumba in these transactions, partic
ularly In the circulation of strike
propaganda. They were implicated In
procuring forged passports from the
United States for the ue of their
countrymen In going home.
Long before the above activities
were made public our Government had
evidence that the Austrian diplomatic
and consular service was being used
In this country for Germany's warlike
purposes.
llrr fnlinmrtnrs rtntblrsa.
While Austria's submarine warfare
has been of a very limited character,
Uicy have adopted and adhered to the
policy of the ruthless submarine war
fare ot the Imperial German Govern
ment. After diplomatic relations with Ger
many were broken, the Department on
February 14, 1917, despatched the fol
lowing telegram to the American Km
bassy at Vienna, sun-eying briefly the
position nf the Austrian Government
on submarine warfare:
"In the American note of December
6, 1915, to the Austro-Hungnrlan Gov
ernment In the Ancona case, this Gov
ernment called attention to the vlcwa
of the Government of the 1'nllrd States
on the operations of submarines In
naval warfare, which had been ex
pressed In no uncertain terms to the
ally of Austria-Hungary' and of which
full knowledge on the part of the
Austro-Hungarlau Government was
presumed. In Its reply of December
15, 1315, the imperial ana ltoyai Gov
ernment stated that It was not pos
sessed with authentic knowledge of

all ef the pertinent correspondence of
the United 8'ates, nor wan It of the
opinion that such knowledge would be
sufficient to cover the Ancona case,
which was of. essentially n different
character from those under discussion
with the Merlin Government.
Fledgte That Was O Iron.
"Nevertheless In reply to the Ameri
can note of December 19, 191K, tho
Austro-Hungariiut Government In Its
note of December 29 elated :
" 'An concerns the jirlnclplo ex
pressed In the very esteemed nolo that
hostile private ships In vo far as they
do not flee or offer resistance mny not
be destroyed without the persons on
board having been plnccd In safety,
the Imperial and Hoyal Government Is
able substantially to useest to this
view of the Washington Cabinet.'
"Moreover, In the case of the Pcrsln, ,
I ho Auitro-Hungarlan Government In
January, 1916. stated In effect that
whllo It had received no Information
with regard to the sinking of tho
Persia, yet In case Its responsibility
wero Involved, the Oovernment would
be guided by the principles agreed to
In the Ancona case.
"Within one month thereafter the
Imperial and Iloyal Oovernment, ro
Incldently with the German declara
tion of February 10, 191fi, on the treat
ment of armed merchantmen an
nounced that 'all merchant vessels
armed with cannon for whatever pur
pose by this very fact lose the char
acter of peaceable vosscls,' nnd that
under these conditions orders have
been given to Austro-Hungnrlan naval
forces to treat such ships as belliger
ent vessels.'
Torpedoed Without Warning;,
"In accordance with this declara
tion several vesel with Amerlcaim on
board have been sunk in the Mediter
ranean, presumably by Austrian sub
marines, some of which were tor
pedoed without warning by subrrm
rlnes flying the Austrian flag, ns in
the cases of the Hrltlsh steamships
flfcondo and Welsh Prince. Inquiries
made through the American Ambassa
dor at Vienna as to thee cases have
so for elicited no Information nnd no
reply.
"Again on January 31, 1917, eolncl
dently with the German declaration of
submarine danger xone In water
washing the coaxts of the Kntcnte
countries, the Imperial and Kiiynl
Government announced to the United
States Oovernment that Austria
Hungary and In allies "would from
February 1 'prevent by every meant
any navigation whatsoever within a
definite closed area.'
"From the foregoing It seems fair to
conclude that the pledge given in the
Ancona case and confirmed In the
FereiA case Is crseitlnlly th same no
that given In the note of the Imperial
German Government dated May 4,
Hit, vix. : 'In accordance with the
general principles of visit and search
and destruction of merchant ves.eli
recognlted by international law, such
veesels both within and without tho
area declared as a naval war zone,
shall rot be sunk without warning
and without raving humun lives un
less these shirs attempt to escape or
offer resistance.' nnd that thh plertie.
has been modified to a greater or
lesser extent by the declarations of
the Imperial and Iloyal Government of
Vbruary lfl. 1911. and January 31,
1917.
Definite Itnllns; Is Asked.
"In view therefore uf the uncer
tainty as to tho Interpretation to bo
placed upon these declaration and
particularly this latter declaration, It
is Important that th t'nlted States ,
Government be advised definitely nnd
clearly of the attitude of the Imperial
and Iloyal Government In regard to
the prosecution of submarine warfare
In these circumstances.
"Pleare bring this matter orally to
the attention of the Austrian Govern
ment and request to be advised ns to

Instruction, It a vine the quoted text

In reply Jlhe Austrian Government
In an aide Tnemolre of March 2, 1(17,
after reviewing the Illegal blockade
measure of the Allloa, stated that "It
now as heretofore firmly adheres to
tho assurances given by It" In the
Ancona case.
The Auslro-IIungarlan Ooverhment
aim Mated that Austro-Hungarlan
submarines had taken no part In tho
sinking of the British steamship 8e
rondo and Welsh Prince, atid that
"the assurance which It gave the
Washington Cabinet In tho Ancona
caso and renewed In tho Perala case
has nolther been withdrawn or re
stricted by Its declaration of Feb
ruary 10, 1910, and January 31, 1917."
Direct Answer la Evaded.
The Austro-Hungarlan noto endeav
ors through a legal argument to show
consistency between these assurances
and Its declarations. In this way
the Austro-Hungarlan Government
eades a direct answer to the Ameri
can Inquiry, but in Its argument It
substantially adheres to the declara
tion of, January 31, 1917, for It states
that "the entire declaration Is essenti
ally nothing else than a warning to
the effect that no merchant ship may
navigate the sea sones accurately de
fined In the declaration," and that
"the Imperial and Royal Government
ls, however, unable to accept a re
sponsibility for the loss of human
liven, which nevertheless may result
from the destruction of armed ships or
ships encountered In the cloeed tones."
In view of this acceptance and
avowal by the Austrian Government
of the policy which has led to a breach
of relations between the United States
nnd Germany the Government of tho
t'nlted Slates found It Impossible to
receive Dumba's successor. Count Tar
nowxkl. The Oovernment felt that It
could not receive a new Ambassador
from a country' which joined Oermany
In her submarine policy, even though
Its participation might be by verbal
and not physical cooperation. This
wa communicated to the Austrian
Government In n telegram from tho
department dated March 23, 1917
Words of. the Presldrat.
In his message to Congress on April
I. 1917, the President said In respect
to the attitude of Autrta-Hungary :

have not made war upon us or chal
lenged us to defend our right and our
honor. The Auetro-Hungarlan Gov
ernment has. Indeed, avowed Ita un
qualified Indorsement lnd acceptance
of the reckless and lawlem submarine
warfare udopted now without dl'gulae
by the Imperial Herman Government,
and It has therefore not been possible
for this Government to receive Count
Tarnowskl, the Ambassador recently
accredited to this Government by the
Imperial and Hoyal Government of
Austria-Hungary: but that Govern
ment has not actually engaged In war
fare against cltlicns of tho United
Stales on tho seas, and I take the lib
erty, for the present nt least, of post
poning a discussion of our relations
with the authorities nt Vienna. Wo
enter this war only where we aro
clearly forced Into It. be?nue there
are no other mean of defending our
rights."
The Austrian note of January 31,
1917, proclaimed the same submarine
policy as that of Oermany. nnd offi
cially announced her Intention, If she
aw fit to pursue the same ruthless
submarine policy that Germany had
Inaugurated.
Many vessels have been sunk In tha
Mediterranean the area In which
Austrian submarines operate by sub
marines which carried no flag or mirk
and the nationality of which was un
known. A great many of these under
sea craft are believed to have been
Austrian submarine or submarines
commanded by Austrian officers or
supplied from Austrian basea or by
Austrian means.
On April 4, 1917, the American four
mnaterl sehnnnee Mamie1te wna sunk
by submarine thirty-life miles from '
the coast of Sardinia, while en routo
to Spain. The submarine carried no
flag or marks to Indicate Its nation- ,
allty. It Is known, however, that
Austrian was the language spoken by'
the officer of the submarine who came
aboard the vessel with the boarding '
party, nnd It Is believed that tho sub
marine was Austrian.
Before war was declared to enlst
between the United States and the Im
perial German Oovernment It was In
timated to the United State Govern
ment that If war should be declared
by the United States upon Oermany
Austria-Hungary would be under obli
gation to break off diplomatic rela
