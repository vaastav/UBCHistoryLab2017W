Scraps and .facts.
? Columbia, December 5: In a very
interesting liquor case, which came up
from Easley. the supreme court, by a
divided opinion filed today, affirmed
the finding of the circuit court in convicting
the agent of Shuman & CoSalisbury
liquor dealers, in taking orders
for liquor at Easley, collecting as
he went. The effect of the decision is
to shut out the drummer. The two
authors of the present Carey-Cothran
dispensary law were arrayed against
each other in the case, Mr. Carey for
the state, which side won, and Mr.
Cothran for the other side, which had
what might be called a near-victory.
? Richmond. Va? December 4: Malvern
Hill, the historic colonial residence
in Charles City county. Va.. seventeen
miles below Richmond on the
James river, belonging to Wm. H. Hall
??f New York, was completely destroyed
by fire this morning. Mr. Hall was
entertaining a party of friends from
New York, who were out shooting at
the time, leaving Mr. Hall alone when
the fire was discovered. Malvern Hill
house was built by Governor Randolph
two hundred and seventy years ago. It
was occupied at one time during the
Revolutionary war by Gen. LaFayette,
and the farm was the scene of the battle
of Malvern Hill, the last of the
seven days' fighting during the civil
war. Mr. Hall had owned the place
about twenty years.
? Cleveland. Ohio, December 6: Fifty-five
of Ohio's eighty-eight counties
are "dry." Seven are wet. This Is the
result of six month's work on the part
of the Ohio Anti-Saloon league since
the Rose county option law went Into
effect. Of the fifty-five counties, five
went dry under an old law. As little
progress was made under that law, it
was displaced by the new law, which
has been successful. Voting will be
held in most of the remaining twentysix
counties within the next few
months. In point of population the
state is nearly half dry now, and in
point of area, two-thirds. Most of the
dry counties do not contain large cities.
So far about 1,730 saloons have
been voted out, about one-third of the
number in the state before the county

? New York, December 4: The attitude
of President Roosevelt on the
subject of woman suffrage, was disclosed
at a meeting under the auspices
of the National League for Civic Education
of Women. Rev. Lyman Abbott
read a letter from President Roosevelt:
"Personally I believe in woman suffrage."
says Mr. Roosevelt, at the outset
of the letter. "But I am not an
enthusiastic advocate of it because I
do not regard it as a very important
matter. I am unable to see that there
has been any special improvement in
the position of women in those states
of the west that have adopted woman
suffrage, as compared with those states
adjoining them that have not adopted
it. I do not think that giving the women
suffrage will produce any marked
improvement in the condition of women."
The president added: "I am
for the reasons given rather what you
would regard as luke warm or tepid in
my support of it, because, while I believe
in It, I do not regard it as of very
much importance."
? Washington, December 4: The campaign
of the war department against
desertions from the army is meeting
with success, according to Adjutant
General F. C. Ainsworth, U. S. A., who
stated in his annual report to the secretary
of war, made public today, that
the relative number of desertions was
less in 190S than in any other fiscal
year since 1901. The desertions during
the fiscal year, 1908, were 4,505, or
4.6 per cent of the whole number of
enlisted men in service in the army,
during that year. Every branch of the
service showed a decrease in the number
of desertions during the year with
the single exception of the hospital
corps, where there was a slight increase.
The report says that the 14th
cavalry had the largest relative number
of desertions of any organization
in the service. Gen. Ainsworth points
out the significant fact that of the
white troops 4.75 per cent were reported
as deserters, while only .57 per cent
of the colored men in the service deserted.
Gen. Ainsworth says that the
certainty of punishment after apprehension
has operated to reduce the
number of desertions.

? Camilla, Ga., December 5: Judge
\V. X. Spence, of the Albany circuit
superior court, has issued warrants
for the arrest of Frank Adams and
John Rodney, prominent white men of
Miller county, charging them with a
serious offence. According to the story
of Andrew Moore, an aged negro,
corroborated by members of his family,
he had a son on the Miller county
chalngang who recently escaped. It is
alleged that a party of night riders,
led by Adams and Rodney, the latter
a deputy sheriff of Miller county, went
Into Baker county looking for the escaped
convict. They went to the old
negro's house and charged him and
his family with hiding the escaped convict.
This they denied, whereupon the
night riders, it is charged, took them
into the woods and severely whipped
the old man, his wife, his son and his
son's wife. This bringing forth no confession
as to the whereabouts of the
escaped convict, a rope was put around
the old man's neck and over the limb
of a tree, and he was being slowly
choked to death when the rope broke
and he managed to escape in the darkness.
followed by a volley of shots from
the guns of the night riders. Judge
Spence has directed that the sheriff arrest
the two men, place them in Jail,
and have them well guarded until the
grand jury meets at Newton, Baker
county, a week from tomorrow. Sheriff
Perry of Baker county, at last reports.
was searching for the alleged
night riders, who have many friends
in Miller county, and who say that the
two men will never be taken.

YORKVILLE. S. C.j
TUESDAY. DECEMBER 8, 1?0X.
We have seen lots of criticisms of
the Williamson plan of corn production:
but the proof of the pudding Is
the eating thereof. The Williamson
plan has made good every time it has
had a fair trial.
The second session of the Sixtieth
congress convened yesterday; but no
business oi importance was iiaumtted.
The senate adjourned out of respect
to the memory of the late Senator
Allison and the reading: of the
president's message was postponed
until today.
Ol'k esteemed contemporary, the
Progressive Parmer, published at Raleigh,
X. C., has been putting forth considerable
effort to show that the Williamson
plan for raising corn, is no
better than some of the older methods.
We admit that we have not been giving
very close attention to what the
Progressive Farmer has had to say on
the subject. We are too thoroughly
convinced that our contemporary is
only arguing and preaching against
the facts. As the result of scores of
inquiries, we find that every farmer
who has tried the Williamson plan has
met with satisfactory results, and to
produce better proof than this would
>e difficult.
Several Dutch war vessels have
been patrolling the coast of Venezuela
duriijg the past few days and word
has gone out that the Dutch government
has started in to bring the Venezuelan
government to terms. The first
war vessel was sighted at La Guira,
Venezuela on last Wednesday morning
it 5 o'clock, and since then the city
has not been showing lights at night.
Statements, supposed to emanate from
the Dutch government, have gone out
to the effect that no actual demonstration
has been commenced: but as to
exactly what the facts are is not altoTether
clear. The common belief, however,
seems to be that the Dutch will
persist in their demonstration until
some definite result is accomplished.
President Harris's letter of this
week to the Farmers' Union is certaini..
o)a.,o tho rio-ht- line There is lust
I > v
a little doubt about the success of the
holding movement last year. The idea
was all right: but the holding movement
was met by a curtailment of production
movement, and the curtailment
got rather the best of it. Of course,
f the holders had been able to hold out
longer, the end would have been different.
But the whole thing was like a
game with many elements of uncertainty.
The present expedient?the one
Mr. Harris is now advising?may not
be so attractive as the other; there is
that about it which fails to appeal so
strongly to many people as does the
holding idea. Diversification, however,
is bound to prove a winner, if it ever
gets a fair show. It will win for each
individual who tries it and it will win
for the south as a whole.
We are inclined to think that in selecting
Champ Clark of Missouri, as
the leader of the minority, the Democrats
have taken about the best man
there is in sight for the position. Mr.
Clark is a level-headed statesman, of
splendid ability to start with, and this
ability is backed by the ripe experience
of long years on the floor of the house.
Mr. John Sharpe Williams is probably
the ablest leader the Democrats have
had since the days of Carlisle; but he
was at a tremendous disadvantage in
having to follow a man who was so incompetent
as Richardson. Mr. Clark
will suffer no disadvantage in following
Williams, at least, not on account of
? ^ urnii..
any incompetency on nnuwu? pan.
but still it will be very well for the
Democrats to keep in mind the fact
that his task?that of building prestige
for his party?under existing circumstances,
is no light one.
William Dudley Foulke of Indiana,
to whom it was written, has given out
a letter from President Roosevelt in
which the president takes occasion to
express himself very warmly and at
considerate length on the subject of
the stories that were published during
the recent campaign to the effect that
the president's son-in-law, Mr. Taft's
brother and othei-s, close to the administration,
benefited largely as the result
of the deal by which an American
company acquired the rights and properties
of the Panama Canal company.
The president denounces the story of
the alleged deal as a lie out of the whdie
cloth and says that all papers In the
case that have not already been published
are on record, and of easy access
to anybody who desires to see them. Editor
Laffan, of the New York Sun, and
Delavan Smith, editor of the Indianapolis
News, come in for the president's
bitterest denunciation.
HARRIS APPEALS TO FARMERS.
Diversification Is the Way to Prosper
ity ana ouccess.
President B. Harris of the State
Farmers' Union, came out last week in
an appeal to the farmers to reduce the
cotton crop and secure higher prices by
devoting to the other crops twenty-five
per cent of the land now planted in
cotton. He urges diversification of
crops as the remedy for the alleged
over-production of cotton.
There is nothing particularly new in
what Mr. Harris says, but he puts it
in a very forcible way.
' Diversification of crops is the remedy
for 9-cent cotton." says Mr. Harris.
' How is the farmer to be able to price
his cotton and get the price he puts
on ills staple, which represents his labor?
There are three tilings essential.
First, organize yourselves: second, cooperate
together: third, diversify your
crops so as to make home self-supporting.
Raise corn, bacon, wheat.
oats, horses, mules and more live stock,
so as to make manure to enrich your
land, and quit buying so much commercial
fertilizer in order to stay out
of debt. The above system will free
the farmers of the bondage they are
now in, for the cotton that has been
sold up to the present time has been
sold at or about the cost of production.
The speculators and the manufacturers
are saying to you that you are making
too much cotton. Now, lets take them
at their word and reduce the cotton
crop next year to twenty-five million
acres and plant the other eight million
acres in food supply crops. This
would make about nine million, three
hundred thousand bales, and the farj
mer would get as much money for the
| nine million, three hundred thousand
bales as we will get for a twelve million,
five hundred thousand bale crop.
Just remember, farmers, when you
make more of a product than you can
control, some one else will take it at
your expense and manage it for you
for their own interest. Now, everyone
knows that cotton is not on a parity
in price with anything else. A suit of
cotton clothes that you could buy
three years ago for 510 now costs you
$18. Cotton should have sold the whole
season for 12 cents per pound from the
time the first bale was pinned. Now,
who is to blame for it selling from 8j
to 9 cents? Nobody except the producer
himself, and do not put the
blame on any one else, for the farmers
have forced it on the market faster
than the speculators wanted It.
Never will the farmers be able to pet
their prices until they make home selfsupporting
and market the cotton crop
as the world needs it. It takes twelve
months to make a cotton crop, and we
must take twelve months to market it
at a profit to the grower. Brother farmer,
it is in our hands to remedy this
evil if it is ever remedied, and the
sooner we realize it the sooner it will
be done. Remember three things to
be done: First, organize: second, cooperate,
and third, diversify crops.
Remember this is a day of organization,
and all professional and business
men are organized. The farmer is also
beginning to realize that he is forced
to do likewise for his protection. I
will give below the following statistical
report taken from the census report of
corn, wheat and oats per capita to feed
each person, horse, mule and hog in
the cotton belt states. I ask you for a
close study of this report and you will
readily see why cotton is selling at 8|
| to 9 cents. I want to urge everyone
who has not sold his cotton to hold on
to it until the price goes up. You may
rest assured that the farmers over the
I cotton belt are going to diversify crops
next year, and this will mean reduction
of cotton acreages:
States Corn Wheat Oats
\labama 19 l-.r> 2-5 1
\rkansas 34 2 3
Georgia 15 8-10 1 2-5
In. Territory ..75 4-5 5 3-5 11 1-3

So. Carolina ...13 9-10 2
Texas 32 2-5 4 S
Florida 10 1-2 0 1-2
Tennessee ...33 6 1 3-10
"A study of the above statistics will
chow the great need vof diversification
of crops, and I want you farmers to remember
that your cotton that you are
to raise in 1909 is now already priced
at less than 9 cents. With this fact
before you why will vou keep on in the
me-crop system? The man who diversifies
his crops is a public benefactor
to his country, feeds his famllv
better, educates his children better, and
Vark 'ornccoo nvpi* thp rlvpr' nen

NOTES FROM OGDEN.
Cotton About All Gathered?Quarterly
Conference?Rev. Beckham's Farewell?Personal
and Other Notes.
V?rre?pnni1enre of the Yorltville Knautrer.
Ogden, December 7.?The people of
this section have about finished gathering
the cotton crop, but there are a
few scattering bales to gin yet. Nearly
everybody is also through sowing
small grain and the people will soon
begin to take notice of the near approach
of Christmas. There will be
a few holidays and then the more
progressive farmers will begin to think
about making preparations to begin
another crop. In fact some are already
plowing out their cotton stalks and if
the ground does not get too wet there
will be considerable plowing done before
Christmas. Just as soon as the
weather clears up and turns real cold,
there will be a lot of pork butchered
around Ogden. There will be some
prize winners in this section when
butchering time comes. Quite a number
of farmers in this community have
some of the first hogs In their pens that
nave ever been raised in tnis pari or
the county. The corn crop turned out
much better than was expected, and
plenty of corn generally means plenty
of pork.
At the fourth quarterly conference of
North Rock Hill circuit, the old board
of stewards of Antloch, consisting of
Messrs. W. S. Perclval. I. S. Kldd, J.
B. Davis and Wm, Newsom, were reelected
for another year. Mr. W. T.
Hollls. superintendent of the Sunday
school was also re-elected. It is a
little hard to keep Sunday schools at
country churches from going into winter
quarters and while the Antioch
Sunday school is not as live as it
should be. (very few of them are) it Is
oerhaps the best school on this charge,
and it will be run through the winter
months, though the attendance may be
rather small for a month or two.
The members of the Chapel at
Smith's Turnout are having a new
coat of paint applied to both the exterior
and interior of the building.
The seats will also be painted.
The Ogden school opened last week
for the winter session with Misses Virginia
Miller of Varnvllle and Margaret
Brownlee of Brownsville, both of this
state, in charge. The school opened
with a good attendance, and the board
of trustees believe that under the new
management, the school will continue
to hold a foremost place among the
rural schools of the county.
Rev. W. A. Beckham, who for two
vears h?s been pastor of the North
Rock Hill circuit, preached his farewell
sermon at Antloch last Sunday
morning to a large congregation. The
people on his charge were hopeful that
he would be returned another year,
but the conference saw fit to send him
to another field. The new pastor, Rev.
W. M. Owings. will preach his first
sermon at Antioch on the afternoon
of the third Sabbath in this month.
H* will come as a stranger to the people.
but it is needless to sav that he
will be received with a welcome that
will make him feel on his first visit
that he is among his best friends.

Holland and Venezuela. ?Holland's
action in revoking her treaty of
1894 with Venezuela is an act of retaliation
that may have serious results
for President Castro's country. Castro's
own performance in closing the
Venezuelan ports to ships coming from
the Dutch Island of Curacao was such
a heavy commercial blow to the Dutch
colonial port of Willemstad that Holland's
counter blow is the natural result
of a retaliation policy. But Its ultimate
significance is in the fact that
the annulment of the treaty of 1894
opens Willemstad to the export trade
in war materials and thus makes it
possible for Venezuelan revolutionists
to use the Dutch port as a base of military
supplies. This alone would stimulate
revolutionary movements In Venezuela,
but the Dutch government goes
much farther. In announcing that it
will not interfere with filibustering expeditions,
it evidently seeks to provoke
a revolutionary outbreak against President
Castro in his own country- Such
an announcement is so far hostile to
Venezuela us to be a breach of international
law and could be legitimately
regarded by the Venezuelan president
is a casus belli. But Holland for some
time has been ready, apparently, for
extremes in her dealings with the South
American country?Springfield Republican.

The railroad agent refused to make
! delivery until the plaintiff had inspected
the goods and there had been
an agreement as to the amount of
damages that would be claimed. The
.suit was for "claim and delivery," and
for punitive damages.
THE SPECULATIVE MARKET.
Yesterday's developments in the
speculative market are summarized In
an Associated Press dispatch of last
night from New York as follows:
The cotton market was unsettled and
closed barely steady at a net decline
of 6 to 8 points. Sales were estimated
at 150,000 bales.
The market opened steady at an advance
of 4 points to a decline of 1
point, near months being relatively
steady on steady cables and larger
English spot sales, but the whole list
eased off right after the opening with
December depressed by a few notices
estimated at about 1,500 bales, while
the general market was influenced by
the continued heavy movement and
scattering liquidation. After showing
a net loss of 6 to 9 points the market
.steadied to within z or i poinis 01
Saturday's finals as a result of covering
during the middle of the day but
weakened again in the late session under
a renewal of liquidation through
wire and commission houses, with last
prices at practically the lowest point.
The National Ginners' Association estimates
the amount of cotton ginned
to December 1st at 11,064,000 bales
and the probable crop at 12,873,000
bales. The census bureau report giving
the amount of cotton ginned to December
1st will be published at the
opening tomorrow and the government's
estimate of the crop will be
published at 1 o'clock on Wednesday.
Southern spot markets officially reported
are generally unchanged. Receipts
continued heavy, but the outlook
is for large clearances during the balance
of the month.
Receipts at the ports today 63,136
bales against 99,771 bales last week
and 47,063 last year. For the week
425,000 bales against 459,291 last week
and 368,793 last year. Today's receipts
at New Orleans 17,505 bales
against 13,759 last year and at Houston
16.232 against 8,547 last year.

Gaffney, December 4: Mr. J. D.
Jones, who has lived in Gaffney and
been identified with her business interests
for nearly twenty years, will
about the 1st of January remove to
Union. Mr. Jones was for several
years a director in the Gaffney Manufacturing
company, and is now a director
of the National Bank of Gaffney.
the Globe Mills and of the Gaffney
Loan and Trust company. He was
the founder of the Gaffney Manufacturing
company and carried around
the first subscription list at the inception
of this enterprise. Being actively
on the cotton market of Gaffney as a
buyer for nearly twenty years and being
a man for sterling Integrity, the
farmers of the county with whom he
has hail ilea lines will feel lost when
they come to Gaffney and do not find
Dudley Jones to bid on their cotton.
Mr. Jones received such a flattering:
business offer from Union that he did
not feel Justified in refusing same.
THE CIRCUIT COURT.
The circuit court on Saturday com-'

that he wanted to go by Char'otte.
The conductor on the main
line declined to carry plaintiff by
Charlotte, except upon payment of
additional fare and put him off at
Blacksburg. The defendant denied
that the ticket had been sold by way
of Charlotte, or with special routing,

WITHIN THE TOWN.
? Do the Christmas shopping before
the rush commences and before the
stocks have been depleted.
? The Victor Oil mill has already
Tinned within a few dozen bales of as
many bales of cotton as it ginned last
vear, and will probably exceed last
vear's figures by several hundred bales.
Manager Fowler, however, is of opinion
that the cotton crop of the county
will be from three to four thousand
bales lighter than it was last year.
? Raw cotton was started into the
machinery of the Lockmore mills last
Friday, and the manufactured product
's now coming out In good shape. The
Lockmore is equipped in first-class
style with all of the latest machinery
ind most approved appliances.
? What came near being a serious
accident; but which fortunately result?d
in but little harm, occurred on Congress
street, not far from The Enquirer
office yesterday morning. Mr.
C. J. Hughes got out of his buggy to
'ift down a valise. The mule became
frightened at something and bolted
down street. Mr. Hughes war Jerked
down and dragged for some distance
through the mud. The front wheel of
he empty buggy struck a wheel of a
buggy in front occupied by Mr. and
Mrs. J. D. Land and Jumped over it
The mule ran on down street until it
was stopped In front of the York Furniture
company. Neither of the bugTies
were broken. One of Mr. Hughes's
egs was bruised quite painfully; but
not seriously.
? Rev. Henry Cauthen, for the past
'wo years pastor of Trinity Methodist
church, preached his farewell sermon
'ast Sunday night. There were no
services at the other churches, and
many of Mr. Cauthen's friends among
the other denominations were out to
Hon > hlin Am iiMiml Yf r Oflllthpn
^reached a most excellent sermon.
The general subject was the practical
value and fitness of denominational division.
He described the different
evangelical denominations as the different
arms of one great and powerful
army, and held that each had its particular
work in the cause of the Master.
He insisted that progress of Christianity
would not be anything like as
satisfactory without these denominational
divisions. Before concluding his
sermon, Mr. Cauthen took occasion to
express in a most feeling manner his
appreciation of the kindness and cooperation
that had been extended to
him by members of his own congregation
and other congregations, and referred
to many warm friendships that
had developed between himself and
members of his own and other congregations.
It was a most affecting
ccasion, many members of the congregation
being moved to tears, partly
because of what Mr. Cauthen had to
say and partly because of contemplation
of the unavoidable detachment of
the sweet and pleasant relations that
have been established during his stay
in Yorkville.
WHAT IS THE GAME LAW?
The recent prosecutions of violators
of the game laws, says the News and
Courier, have caused some persons
with minds given to research, to look
up the law on the subject in order to
ascertain just what the present game
law is, as the legislature has passed a
law for three sessions in succession,
there being a difference in the text of
each act. A glance at the acts, and
without going very deep in the subject,
discloses the fact that two of the
acts, that of 1906 and that of 1908, are
apparently practically dead, for the
reason that the act of 1906 was repealed
by the act of 1907, and the act
of 1908 amends the act of 1906, which
already had been repealed. Therefore,
it looks as if the act of 1907 is the
only act at present of force. It will be
interesting to note a part of the wording
of the three acts.
The act of 1906 is entitled, "An act
for the further protection of partridges
and quail." Section 1 provides in part
as follows: "That it shall be unlawful
for any person, except upon his own
lands, or on the lands of another with
the consent of the owner thereof, to
net or trap any partridge or quail; and
it shall be unlawful for any person to
sell, or ship or export for sale, any partridge
or quail, for the space of five
years, from the 20th day of February,
A. D. 1912. * Provided, that the
handling, possession, control or ownership
of any of said birds sold, offered
or exposed for sale, or shipped or exported,
shall be prima facie evidence
of the violation of this act, and the
burden of proof shall be upon the person
so handling, possessing, controlling
or owning any of the said birds to
show that they were imported from another
state or territory. Any person
violating this act shall be guilty of a
misdemeanor, etc."
Section 2 prohibits the killing of
Mongolian pheasants.
Section 3 provides for the issuing of
licenses to non-resident hunters upon
the payment of a license fee of twentyfive
dollars, and concludes as follows:
"All licenses and fines collected under
this act shall be turned over to the
game warden."
This act was approved February 21,
1906.
In 1907 the legislature passed an act
entitled, "An act to incorporate the Audubon
Society of South Carolina, and
to provide for the preservation of the
wild birds, non-migratory hsn and animals
of the state," which provides
principally for regulations in regard
to the transportation of game birds and
...11,1 o.m.miiIu o 1 on nrnt- Irloq nPHP 1 -
\\ 11 u tiili maio aim aiuv v? iuvm ^v*.w.
ties for such transportation when in
violation of the act. The act also provides
that all moneys obtained from
fines or forfeitures shall be deposited
with the state treasurer to the credit
of the "game protection fund."
Section 15 of this act is as follows:
"An act entitled 'an act for the further
protection of partridges and quail.'
approved the 21st day of February, A.
D. 1906, and all other acts or parts of
acts inconsistent herewith are hereby
repealed."
In 1908 the legislature again passed
an act on the subject, the title of
which is as follows: "An act to amend
an act entitled 'an act for the further 1
ther protection of partridges and quail,' ;
approved 21st day of February, A. D. ,
1906, by changing the time, and Include
Mongolian pheasants and wild 1
turkey." !
SERIOUS RUNAWAY ACCIDENT. I
Mr. C. Henry Smith, the well known
carrier on Yorkvllle rural free delivery
route No. 4, and the winner of the
Farmers' Union corn prize last week,
is lying: at his home five miles south
of Yorkville in quite a serious condition,
as the result of injuries sustained in a
runaway accident last Saturday evening.
The accident occurred at the overhead
bridge on the Chester road, between
5 and 6 o'clock. Mr. Smith was
on his way home. Just as he started
across the bridge, an engine pulling a
long and heavy freight train came puf- j
fing underneath. Mr. Smith had not |
noticed the train until he was right
over it, and although he is a most
excellent horseman, the spirited animal
he was driving was quickly made frantic
by the hot vapors that were forced
up through the cracks of the bridge by
the exhaust from the smokestack and
went plunging down the road.
After the first two or three Jumps,
Mr. Smith turned the horse Into a side
road, but within a short distance the
wheels struck a rough place, the singletree
broke in three pieces, and
with another jump or two of the horse
the buggy was turned over on top of
Mr. Smith, who was probably dragged
some distance before the horse finally
succeeded in disentangling itself and
getting away.
It is probable that Mr. Smith was
unconscious for a little while; but if
so it was only for a very few moments.
A negro man who saw most of the occurrence
came to his relief as he was
trying to rise to his feet, and Mr. M.
F. Revels, who was coming along right
behind, and who also had a narrow escape
from a similar adventure, helped
Mr. Smith into his own buggy and
brought him back to the office of Drs.
White & Kell, who looked after his
injuries.
There were ugly bruises in the left
side of Mr. Smith's face, and it seemed
at first that he would certainly lost one
eye. His tongue was bitten nearly in
two, and it required quite a number
of stitches to close up the different
ugly wounds he sustained. After the
doctors had made him as comfortable
as possible, he was taken to his home,
where he has since been getting along
as well as could be expected under the
circumstances. Information this morning
was to the effect that he is still In
a good deal of pain; but there is every
reason to expect that he will be able
to be out again within a few days.

Buzzard Puts Mills Out of Business.
Several North Carolina cotton mills
that are driven by the electric current [
of the Catawba Power company, were .
put out of business for an hour or two 1
last Friday by a turkey buzzard. Mayor
John R. Hart of Yorkville, who was
In Clover Saturday, has given The Enquirer
Information of the peculiar clrstance.
It seems that when the mills
to the north of Nanny's mountain attempted
to start up Friday morning,
their motors failed to respond. There
was no current. The trouble could not
be located by telephone, and linemen
were started out to run It down. Everything
was all right and in good
shape except at a point near Nanny's
mountain. Here the ends of the wires
were on the ground, and examination
showed that they had been burned in
two. Further investigation disclosed
the remains of a partially cremated
turkey buzzard. The buzzard was lying
between the ends of the wires.
With the evidences and indications at
hand, the linemen read a story to the
effect that the buzzard had first lighted
on a nearby tower, and after resting
there a while, had Jumped down on
one of the transmission wires. After
that he no doubt spread out his wings,
bringing the two currents together and
forming a short circuit which burned
the wires in two and almost Instantly
converted the buzzard's body into cinders.
The actual time lost by the mills
was hardly more than two hours, for
as soon as possible after the trouble
was discovered in the morning, the
current from the power houses was
started over a duplicate line. But to
repair the damage that resulted on account
of the buzzard required nearly
% whole day.
Development at Ninety-Nine Islands.
Charlotte Observer, Saturday: Mr.
B. H. Hardaway of Columbus Ga., tills
week signed the contract for the construction
of the mammoth dam and
power house which is to be built at
Ninety-Nine Islands, near Blacksburg,
S. C.. by the Southern Power company.
Contracts were also given the Southeastern
Lime and Cement company of
(liarleston, S. C., for 400,000 sacks of
the highest grade of Portland cement
for use on the work. The contract for
water wheels aggregating $125,000 was
given the Allls-Chalmers company of
Detroit, Mich., and that for the electrical
machinery, the Westinghouse company.
This electrical machinery contract
will amount to something like
$130,000. The water wheels have already
been placed on the ground and
the electrical machinery has been built
and tested. The railroad connecting
with the Southern's main line was finished
long ago and everything, derricks,
shanties, shops and all, is In
readiness for active work. The- dam
will Kn 1 o rorout In tho annth It
will have an extreme helghth of 85
feet and will be about 1,000 feet long.
It will contain 160,000 cubic yards of
masonry. The power house Is to be
ready by January 1st, 1910, and the
machinery ready for operations by
March 1st, following. Mr. Hardaway,
the contractor, Is one of the leaders
.n the trade in the south. The mere
tact that he has built five powers on
the Chattachooche river, one at Atlanta,
two at West Point, and two at Columbus,
Ga.; one on the New river at
t ries, Va.; one on the Yadkin river
at Winston-Salem; two In South Carolina,
at Anderson and at Spartanburg,
and one on the Flint river In Georgia
is a testimonial as to who and what
he is. Last week Mr. Hardaway secured
a half million contract from the
government for work on the Warrior
river near Tuscaloosa, Ala. Mr. Hardaway,
while he will supervise the
work at Ninety-Nine Islands, will have
Mr. T. A. Jamison actively in charge.
SOUTH CAROLINA NEW8.
? Gaffney Ledger: Deputy Collector
John P. Scruggs exploded a bomb shell
among the tobacco and cigar merchants
of Gaffney last Friday, when he
informed them that all who had failed
to cancel the stamps on tobacco and
cigars boxes would be subjected to a
hne of $50. He found uncancelled
empty boxes In about ten stores, and
ihe proprietors are speculating as to
the outcome of the collector's action.
Collector Scruggs is also requiring all
those who have been convicted in the
state or municipal courts of selling
whisky to take out a license for the
time, during which they were engaged
In the Illegal traffic. It is likely that
several will have to "come across" In
this county.

? Lancaster, December 5: A serious
fire occurred in Lancaster at an early
hour this morning, the alarm being
given about 3 o'clock. When first discovered
the flames were issuing from
the Lancaster Mercantile company's
brick warehouse, in the vicinity of the
Southern railway depot. The building
was constructed with the regulation fire
walls, which saved half the structure.
The part, however, in which the fire
started was entirely destroyed, togeth?r
with its contents. Another warehouse
nearby, owned by the Kershaw
Oil mill and used by the Bennett Grocery
company, was also consumed, likewise
the seed house of the Lancaster
Mercantile company, shed over the
Standard Oil company's tank and about
mn nf mttnn. 4fi bales of which I
were In a box car on the Southern's
side track and the remainder on the
nublic cotton platform. Several hundred
other bales on the platform were
saved with great difficulty. The Lancaster
Cotton Oil company also had
about $300 worth of seed burned, the
loss being1 covered by insurance. The
other losses were approximately: Lancaster
Mercantile company, damage to
warehouse, $4,000; destruction of merchandise
in same, $7,000. Both bulld'ng
and contents insured. Kershaw Oil
Mill company, warehouse burned, $100:
covered by insurance. Merchandise
destroyed in building belonging to Bennett

Charleston, but in the application for
incorporation the route Is not stated,
it is stated, however, that Spartanburg
is included in the route. The
"apUat stock Is placed at $30,000,000
?nd the application is signed by Wm.
H. Lyles of this cltv, George L. Carter
of Johnson City. Tenn., A. A.
ph'eean of Bristol. Tenn. The charter
also states that the line is chartered
in Virginia, the application here
being to domesticate the line. Ac*ording
to present plans Spartanburg
will be a terminal and another terminal
is a point near Island Ford ferrv.
Dt the line 108 miles have already
neen constructed and the total length
s 244 miles. The plans so far call for
tt least twenty miles in South Caro'na.
The head office is in St. Paul,
^a., and the line at present begins in
Etussel county, that state. The fee
'or the charter filed with the seere
i" *o arm TMo
,ui y ui niaic is ai icani * ?
ipplleation for this charter is of considerable
importance to the entire
state. It is known almost officially
hat the C.. C. & O. line has terminal
Dlans for the port of Charleston, prodded
arrangements can be made with
hat city. The recent banquet in
Spartanburg at which the railroad oficials
connected with that and other
ines were present, attracted attention
ill over the state and since then it has
)een regarded as a certainty that
Columbia will be one of the importmt
feeding points on the line and in
act it is believed that headquarters
or some of the officials will be esablished
here. The railroad officials
onnected with the line are naturally
eticent about their plans, but those
vho keep posted on railroad matters
enow that the line will eventually go
hrough this city and continue to the
oast. When a domestic charter is
tpplled for the line of route will be
ffven. The following from the Seninel
of Erwin, Tenn., concerning the
stabllshment of the shops, will be of
nterest: "We do not wish to take a i
oo optimistic view of the future pos- .
slbllities of Erwln following the loca- i
tlon of the general shops, yards and U
division headquarters of the Carolina, ^
Cllnchtleld and Ohio railway at this I
place, hut without a taint of exaggeration,
we feel safe In the prediction *
that the growth and prosperity of our
city following close upon the heels of
the above enterprise will be wonderful
in comparison to what it otherwise
might have been. New enterprises
will likely spring up on every hand.
Various mills and factories will soon
realize the advantages of our town
for the location of their enterprises,
and with promised phenomenal
growth in our population will come
the growth in manufacturing and
commercial enterprises as well as all
other business. No town in Tennessee
nor In the entire south for that mat- 4
ter, affords a more favorable point
for the location of various manufacturing
and commercial enterprises
than does the town of Erwln on the
line of the Carolina, Clinchfleld and
Ohio railway."

Sensation Brewing In Columbia.?
News comes from Columbia that there ?
are some sensational developments ^
brewing in Columbia with the affairs
of a concern known as the "Blank Security
Company," which its stockholders
are finding not to be nearly so secun~
as its alluring name would indicate.
There are said to be some "big
people" involved in it. and the newspapers
and the newspaper correspondents
are keeping quiet about the concern
and affairs in several different
languages. Sooner or later, however,
the stockholders are going to make a
howl so loud that something will be *
heard about it. The possession of a
beautiful engraved stock certificate,
received in exchange for real money,
but worth about as much as a canceled
postal card, is hardly sufficient to ?atIsfy
the most stupid sucker that can ^
be found by the plausible agents of the
get-rlch-quick concerns.?Spartanberg
