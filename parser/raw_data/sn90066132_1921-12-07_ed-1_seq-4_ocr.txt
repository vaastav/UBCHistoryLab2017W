To the Editor: I have just

November 2a) In which he states
that the state Institutions are In
the large majority of cases the re

the cart before the horse. The
money paid in taxes might help
keep up better homes, is it the
poor man who is .taxing us? We
all know who has tiixeil us from
Caesar's time until now and the
scriptures say the rich man always
oppresses the poor not sometimes

deny this? Its a good thing Abra

our really great men have rose
from the ranks of povertyr-simply
because they were great in 3plte of
their poverty. Today there is too
much emphasis placed on society
and too little on the rights of
motherhood and childhood. Yes,
children have rights, but I say (lod

Children? No never. Institutions,

Taxing Slacker Wealth
i In that meandering labyrinth of circumlocution entitled
the president's message appears one sensible suggestion that
will meet the approval of every one except the beneficiaries
of the system, namely the abolition of the tax-exempt secur
ity, a procedure which would force slacker wealth to pay
its just share of the taxation it now evades.
Last spring Secretary of the Treasury Mellon recom
mended legislation to curb the issuance of tax-exempt se
curities. While congress has frequently debated the subject,
with the apparent object of finding out how not to do it,
nothing has been accomplished save the issuance of some
hundreds of millions of additional tax-exemDt securities to
finance the new loans to industry. Even the proposal to
make these issues come under the inheritance tax law met
defeat , . , . . ,
It has been estimated that from 20 to 40 billions of wealth
is escaping taxation, in these tax-exempt securities issued by
nation, state, city and district. The fact that wealth can
evade taxation by such investment has largely nullified the
surtax and so increased the burden of taxation for nthpr
forms of property. To make matters worse, the issuance of
such securities shows no signs of diminution on the con
trary, is rapidly increasing. . - v
The worst feature of the situation is that capital that
should go into useful production and needed industry is
directed into these untaxed investments to escape 'paying its
share of the cost of government.
The president M led to outline a program of procedure
to congress, contenting Mmself with suggesting a constitu
tional amendment. Congress is, however, too accustomed
to obstruction and destruction to do much in a constructive!
way. uut until congress ends for all time the -issuance of
tax-exempt securities, all efforts to tax wealth will be
abortive.

Virginia Motor With Herb
As I sat revelling in Kia's dress
ing room at the studio thinking
over my first day in the morleb
and preparing to go home, I found
I had been living somewhat on
the outside of it all. I had been
revelling in others' experiences
and they had all been so very now
to me. Could I make these ex
periences of. any use to myselt?
I had barely concluded, that I
might do so.when gome one rapped'
at me aoor.
"Rial Ria!" It was Herb Rich,
ardson'a voice.
"Ria isn't here. Mr. Richardson.
She has .gone home. She is trying
to find you,"
"All" right. I'll wait for you
and take you down."
I had a moment's doubt about
this. Was It the right thins lor
me to do? In Ria's present excit
ed state ot mind would Bhe under
stand?
However, I decided to go with
him.
I do not think that we always
realise our thoughts and actions
are affected by the seemingly

Parson Abiel Haile
"And lead captive silly women." 2 Timothy S-6.
Paul was "nine minute egg" If ever there was one, when It came
to a very complete knowledge of masculinity and feminity. He knew
the average man to be a poor tish, with the average woman In about
the same category until touched with a genuine desire, proved by
deportment, to be decent, and do the utmost humanly possible of liv
ing up to the basic doctrine of a really religious belief. Paul gave
much thought to the woman problem and was more or less disgusted
with feminity at times. He wanted them to be womanly, home
makers, mothers of men and women, and at the same time be neat
and clean in externals as well as spiritually. In Paul's day there
flourished lady killers as now. Some were teachers Or preachers ot
a sort, soke were scribes, some were men with money who concealed

Northern Africa
' There is also thn t Junjperfwhose heart-wood
yields an oil that healeth akin affections.'
IN the stony wastes of Northern Africa, land of
Arab sheik and wandering Bedouin, there grows
a low juniper tree, whose heart-wood, roasted in
ovens, gives up an oily, brownish, tar-like liquid of a
smoky taste. Since time immemorial natives of the
region have used this oil for various skin affections.

Vicks VapoRub in stein erup

nettle rash, cuts, burns and
bAiisee. Its vapors assist in
overcoming cold troubles.
The U. S. Dispensatory, our
national authority on the uses
of all drugs, mentions the use
of Oil of Juniper Tar by the
- North African tribes, and adds:
" Mow nemoty St has been leagriy
ed hi ft treatment of chronic

In Vicks, Juniper Tar, Cam

are so combined that body heat
gradually vaporizes them.
While penetrating and stimu
