Giver of all good for the large and un--usual

;o h . "hist annual message to Coii
, ress ii , ), connected with the hViancial
opera f.nns of the Government diTectly
au'ectins the business interests the
country I congratulate Congress on
the successful execution of the', lie-
sumption act. At the time flxed arid in
j'.. the manner contemplated by. -law,
: Univci States notes began to be re
d(!" iid in coin, since the 1st of Jan
' , . u last they have been promptly
n. pied on presentation, and in all
' bu i less transactions.public or private ,
'n ail parts of the country, they are
a ceived and paid out as the equivalent
, of coin. The demand upon the Treas
ury for gold and silver in excliange for
v United States notes has been compara
i tively small, and the voluntary deposit
of coin and bullion in exchange for
notes has been verv iartre. The excess
of the precious metals deposited or ex
changed for United States notes over
the amount or united Mates notes ie
deemed is about $40,000,000.
Resumption and Refunding.
The resumption of specie payments
: has been followed by a very great re
: vival of business. With a currency
. :' equivalent in value to the money
or the commercial world, we are
'-" enabled to enter upon , an equal compe
tition with oilier nations in trade and
production. The increasing foreign de
mand for our manufactures and agri
cultural products has caused a large
balance of trade in our favor, whicli
has been paid in srold, from the 1st of
July last, to November 15th, to the
amount of about $59,000,000. Since the
... resumption of specie payments there
.- has also been a marked and gratifying
improvement or the puoiic credit, me
bonds of the Government bearing only
- four per cent, interest have been sold
. 4 at or above par, sufficient in amount to
1 nav oil all the National debt which was
redeemable under present laws. The
Amount of interest saved annually bv
: ' the process of refunding the debt, since
v . March 1st, 1877, is $14,21)7,177. The
bonds sold were largely in small
V sums, and the number of our citi
. . zens now holding the public securi
!""" ties is much greater than ever before.
.'.- The amount of the National debt which
.'. matures within less than two years is
' - $792,131,700, of which $500,000,000 bear
interest at the rate of live per cent.,
and the balance is in bonds bearing six
per cent, interest. It is believed that
this part of the public debt can be re
; funded by the issue of four per cent.
bonds, and by the reduction of interest
which will tints be effected, about
eleven million of dollars can be annu
ally saved to the Treasury. To secure
this important reduction of interest to
be paid by the L'nited States, further
. legislation is required, which, it is
r-'if . hoped, will be provided by Congress
irVduring its present session.
- ',-' The coinage bv the mints of the
''.'United States, during the last fiscal
.,. yeftf was Sl(),iiS(),U12. The coinage of
siU'er dollars, since the passage of the
. arl for that purpose, up to November
1st, 187H, was $4',wv.-o, of which $12,
700,344 have been issued from the
Treasury and are now in circulation,
and $32,300,500 are still in the posses
sion of the Government.
Coinage.
The pendency of tlie proposition for
unity of action between the United
States and the principal commercial
nations of Europe, to effect a perma
nent system for the equality of gold and
silver in the recognized money of t he
world, leads me to recommend that
Congress refrain from new legislation
on the general subject. The great revi
val of trade, internal and foreign, will
supply, during the coming year, lis own
instructions, which may well be await
ed before attempting further experi
mental measures with the coinage. I
would, however, strongly urge upon
Congress the importance of authorizing
the Secretary of the Treasury to sus
pend the coinage of silver dollars upon
the present legal ratio. The market
' value of the silver dollar being uni
formly and largely less than the market
value of the gold dollar, it is obviously
impracticable to maintain them at par
with each other if both are coined with
out limit, if the cheaper coin is forced
into circulation it will, if coined with
out limit, soon become the sole standard
of value, and thus defeat the desired
object, which is a currency of both gold
and silver, which shall be of equivalent
value, dollar for dollar, witli the uni
versally recognized money of the world.
The retirement from circulation of
United States notes, with the capacity
of legal-tender in private contracts, is
a step to be taken in our progress
towards a safe and stable currency,
which should be accepted as the policy
and duty of the Government, and the
interest and security of the people. It
is my firm conviction that the issue of
legal-tender paper money based wholly
upon the authority and credit of the
Government, except in extreme emer
gency, is without warrant in the Con
stitution, and a violation of found finan
cial principles. The issue of United
States notes during the late civil war
with the capacity of legal-tender be
tween private individuals was not
authorized except as a means of rescu
ing the country from imminent peril.
The circulation of these notes as paper
money, for any protracted period of
time after the accomplishment of this
purpose, was not contemplated by the
f ramers of the law under which they
were issued. They anticipated the re
demption and withdrawal of these notes
at the earliest practicable period con
sistent with the attainment of the object
for which they were provided.
Sinking Fund.
The policy , of the United States,
Bwiuiuy aunerca to irom tne adoption
of the Constitution, has been to avoid
the creation of a National debt, and
when, from necessity in time of war,
debts have been created, they have been
paid off on the return of peace as rap-
no uaoiuie. iui WIS V16W, Rlld
for this purpose, it is recommended
that the existing laws for the accumu
lation of a sinking-fund sufficient to
extinguish the public debt within a
limited period be maintained. If any
change of the objects or rates of tax
ation is deemed necessary by Congress,
. 18 B"e8ted that experience has
shown that a duty can be placed on tea
and coffee, which will not enhance the
price of those articles to the consumer,
i.hioCU wil! add 80Veral millions ol
dollars annually to the Treasury.
Polygamy.
The continued deliberate violation by
a large number of prominent and in
fluential citizens of the Territory c ,
Utah of the laws of the United fetates
for tjhd prosecution and punishment of
polygamy demands the attention of
every department of the Government
This Territory has a population
sufficient to entitle it to admission as a
State, and the general interests of the
Nation, as well as the welfare of the
citizens of the Territory, require its ad
vance from the territorial form of gov
ernment to the responsibilities and
privileges of a State. This important
change will not, however, be approved
by the country while the citizens of
Utah in very considerable number up
hold a practice which is condemned as
a crime by the laws of all civi hzed
communities throughout the world.
The law for the suppression of this
offence was enacted with great unan
imity by Congress more tnan seventeen
years ago, but has remained until re
nuntlv ii (lend letter in the Territory of
Utah because of the peculiar difficulties
attending its enforcement. The opin
ion widely pievailed among the citizens
of Utah that the law was in contraven
tion of the Constitutional guarantee of
religious freedom. This objection is
now removed. The Supreme Court of
tin llnitfid states has decided the law
to be within the legislative power of
Congress, and binding as a rule of ac-
lion ior an wnu icsiuo hiujui mo m
ritovis. There is no lomrer any reason
for delav or hesitation in its enforce-
mpnt. it should he tlrmlv and effect
ively executed. If not sufficiently
stringent in its provisions it should be
amended, and, in aid of this view, I
recommend that more comprehensive
and more searching methods for pre
venting as well as punishing this crime
be provided. If necessary to secure
obedience to the law. the enjoyment
and exercise of the rights and privi
leges of citizenship in the Territories of
the United States may be withheld or
withdrawn from those who violate or
oppose the enforcement of the law on
inis subject.
The People and the Laws.
The elections of the past year, though
occupied only with Slate offices, have
not failed to elicit in the political dis
cussions which attended them all over
the country, new and decisive evidence
of the deep interest which the great
body of citizens take in the progress of
the country towards a more general and
complete establishment, at whatever
cost, of universal security and freedom
in the exercise of the elective franchise.
While many topics of political concern
demand great attention from our peo
ple, both in the sphere of National and
State authority, I Bad no reason to qual
ify the opinion I expressed in my last
annual message, that no temporary or
administrative interests of government,
howevei urgent or weighty, will ever
displace the zeal of our people in de
fence of the primary-rights of citizen
ship, and that the power of public opin
ion will override all political prejudices,
and all sectional and State attach
ments, in demanding that all over our
wide territory the name and character
of citizen of the United States shall
mean one and the same thing, and carry
with them unchallenged security and
respect. 1 earnestly appeal to the in
telligence and patriotism of all good
citizens of every part of the country,
however much they may be divided in
opinions on other political subjects, to
unite in compelling obedience to exist
ing laws aimed at the protection of the
right of suffrage. 1 respectfully urge
upon Congress to supply any defects in
these laws which experience has shown
and whicli is within its power to rem
edy. I again invoke the co-operation of
the executive and legislative authori
ties of the Slates in this great purpose.
I am fully convinced that if the public
mind can be set at rest on this para
mount question of popular rights, no
serious obstacle will thwart or delay
the complete pacification of the country
or retard the general diffusion of prosperity.
Reforming the Civil Service.
In a former message I invited the at
tention of Congress to the subject of
the reformation of the civil service of
the Government, and expressed the
intention of transmitting to Congress
as early as practicable a report upon
this subject by the chairman of the
Civil-Service Commission.
The views I have heretofore expressed
concerning the defects and abuses in
our civil administration remain un
changed, except in so far as an enlarged
experienced has deepened my sunse otj
the duty ooiu or uie omcers .urn oi uie
people themselves to co-operate for
their removal. The grave evils and
perils of a partisan-spoils system of ap
pointment to office and of office tenure,
are now generally recognized. In the
resolutions of the great parties, in the
reports of Departments, in the debates
and proceedings of Congress, in the
messages of Executives, the gravity of
these evils has been pointed out and
the need of their reform has been ad
mitted. To command the necessary support
every measure of reform must be based
on common right and justice, and must
be compatible with the healthy exist
ence of great parties, which are inevita
ble and essential in a free State.
When the people have approved a
policy at a National election, confidence
on the part of the officers they have
selected, and of the advisers who, in
accordance with our political institu
tions, should be consulted, in the policy
which it is their duty to carry into
effect, is indispensable. It iseminently
proper that they should explain it be
fore the people, as well as illustrate its
spirit in the performance of their
official duties.
Very different considerations apply
to the greater number of those who fill
the subordinate places in the civil ser
vice. Their responsibility is to their
superiors in official position. It is their
duty to obey the legal instructions of
those upon whom that authority is de
volved, and their best public service
consists in the discharge of their func
tions irrespective of partisan politics.
Their duties are the same, whatever
party is in power and whatever policy
prevails. As a consequence, it follows
that their tenure of office should not
depend on the prevalence of any policy
or the supremacy of any party, but
should be determined by their capacity
to serve the people most usefully, quite
irrespective of. partisan interests. The
same considerations that should govern
he tenure, should also prevail in the
appointment, discipline, and removal
of these subordinates. The authority
of appointment and removal is
not a perquisite, which may be used to
aid a friend or reward a partisan, but is
a trust to be exercised in the public in
terest, under all the sanctions which
attend the obligation to apply the pub
lie funds only for the public purposes.
Every citizen has an equal right to
the honor and profit of entering the
f ubhc service of nis country. The only
ust ground of discrimination, is the
measure of character and capacity he
has to make that service most useful to
the people. Except in caces where,
upon just and recognized principles, as
upon the theory of pensions, offices and
promotions are bestowed as rewards for
past services, their bestowal upon any
theory which disregards personal merit,
is an act of injustice to the citizen, as
well as a breach of that trust subject to
which the appointing power is held.
Methods of Examination.
In the light of these principles, it be
comes of tfreat importance to nrovide
just and adequate means, especially for
every department ana large adminis
trative office, where personal discrimi
nation on the part of its head is not
practicaiue, ror ascertaining uiuac4'j.u
ltications to which appointments and
removals should have reference. To
fail to provide such means is not Only
to deny the opportunity of ascertaining
the facts upon which the most. right
eous claim to office depends, but, of
necessity, to discourage all worthy as
pirants, by handing over appointments
and removals to mere inlluence and
favoritism. If it is the right of the
worthiest claimant to gain the appoint
inent,and the interest of the people to
bestow it upon him, it would Beora
clear that a wise and just method, of
ascertaining personal fitness for office
must bo an important and permanent
function of every just and wise gov
ernment. It has long since become
impossible, in the great offices, for those
having the duty of nomination and
appointment, to personally examine
into the individual qualifications of
more than a small proportion of those
seeking office; and, with the enlarge
ment ot the civil sBrvice, mat propor
tion must continue to become less.
In the earlier years' of the Govern
ment, the subordinate oinces were so
few in number that it was quite' easy
for those making appointments and
promotions to personally ascertain
the merits of candidates. -Party mana
gers and methods had not then become
powerful agencies or coercion, nosiue
to the free and just exercise of the ap
pointing power.
Responsibility of the President.
A large and responsible part of the
duty of restoring the civil service to the
desired purity and efficiency rests upon
the President, and it is my purpose to
do what is within my power to advance
such prudent and gradual measures of
reform as will most surely and rapidly
bring about that radical change of sys
tem essential to make our administra
tive methods satisfactory to a free and
intelligent people. Uv a proper exer
cise ot authority, it is in the power of
the Executive to do much to promote
such a reform, liut it cannot be too
clearly understood that nothing ade
qnate can be accomplished without co
operation on the part of Congress and
considerate and intelligent support
among the people, iteforma which
challenge the generally accepted theo
ries of parties, and demand changes in
the methods of departments, are not
the work of a day. Their permanent
foundations must be laid in sound
principles, and in an experience which
demonstrates their wisdom and ex
poses the errors of their adversaries.
Every worthy officer desires to make
his official action a gain and an honor
to his country, but the people them
selves, far more than their officers in
public station, are interested in a pure,
economical, and vigorous administra
tion. By laws enacted in 1853 and 1855, and
now in substance incorporated in the
Revised Statutes, the practice of arbi
trary appointments to the several subor-Continued
