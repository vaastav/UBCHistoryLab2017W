President's Message Read Today—
"Deliberate Circumspection"
for Nicaragua.
"WASHINGTON. Be* 7.—President Taft's first regular
annual message to congress was sent to that body today.
It consists of about 20,000 words, and at that leaves for
subsequent discussion in special messages the important
subjects of anti-trust and interstate commerce legislation,
as well as legislation for further laws to promote the con
servation of the natural resources. These questions are
mostly referred to incidentally in the present message.
With regard to Nicaragua, President Taft refers to the
"sad tale of the unspeakable barbarities and oppression
alleged to have been committed by the Zelaya govern
ment," and to the fact that two Americans were recently
pttt to death by order of Zelaya himself. lU' says that this
government is proceeding "with deliberate circumspec
tion" to determine the exact truth and the course to be
pursued "most consistent with its dignity, its duty to
American interests and its moral obligations to Central
America."
The message exonerates Japan from the charge of seek
ing a monopoly in Manchuria, and says that our relations
with that country continue cordial as usual.
It points out the successful efforts that have been made
to bring about economy in government expenses, the esti
mates for government expenses having .been cut over $55,-
-000,000. The president recommends that the deficit iv the
treasury shall be met by the issue of Panama bonds.
Legisk'ftOfl to produce expedition
In legal procedure is asked for, as
well as a law to prevent the iss.u
ance (if injunctions without notice.
The prcsldeut recommends the
establh.hrient of postal savings
banks .'md the nassage of a ship
subsidy 1 ill lckolng to the estab
lishment of lines to South Amer
ica. China. Japan and tho Philip
pines. He urged the admission a-
Keparate tlatea of New Mexico and
Arizona, and suggests the appoint
ment Of an executive council for
Alaska, but strongly deprecates the
Idea of tlie election of n territorial
legislature for that district.
Referring to the frauds dlsoov
(ted at tbe New YoVU customs
hOUse, of which the BUgar trust was
the beneficiary, the president says
that the government has recovered
from Hie trust all Unit it is shown
to have been di frauded of from
under weights, and that tlie treas
ury department and department of
Justice are exerting every effort to
discover Ihe wrongdoers, "includ

THRILLING STORY OF "THE THIRD DEGREE" BEGUN TODAY
Today the Press begins printing
the story of "Tho Third Degree."
The dramatization of this novel will
be produced at the Auditorium the
ater December 12, 13 and 14. The
Press runs the story because It was
dramatized by Charles Klein, author
of "The Lion and the Mouse," and
because it deals with the third de
gree treatment practised by the po
, lice of some cities. A local story or
two on this proposition Is possible.
Watch for the rest of the story to
morrow and during the remainder

ments interested feads me to hope
for a satisfactory settlement of this
question as the ultimate outcome
of the negotiations.

WOMAN HOLDER OF RECORD BREAKING BOWLING SCORES
SAYS SUCCESS IS DUE 10 CONSTANT DAILY PRACTICE
WATERTOWN, N. V., Dec. 6.—
Having smashed all bowling rec
ords under circumstances which
seem to leave no room to doubt
the genuineness of her perform
ances, Mrs. Henry N. Dutterworth
of this city is champion high score
bowler of the world. Mrs. Butter
worth's record follows:
300, 300, 299, 299. 297, 289, 288,
283, 279, 279, 279, 279.
Total pins, 3471. Average, 289%.
These scores were the 12 best
games bowled in a tournament.
That tho.alleys were regulation,
the scoring correct and the pins set
true, are substantiated by affi
davits, necessary when the public
refused to accept the performance.
To show WHAT a performance
was Mrs. Butterworth's, attention
is called to winning scores in the
big tournaments. In March Fred
Scbwnrtje, in Rochester, N. V.,
won the National Bowling associa
tions' individual championship with
696 for three games. At the A. B.
('. in Pittsburg A. Wingler's G99
was the best. In the Canadian
Championship, Jacob Sebring won
With 660 In 1908. The average of
Jimmy Smith in Milwaukee was
233, but his across-the-country
games would not average 200. Miss
Lltlefleld and Mrs. Bishop rolled
3160 in 19 games in New York last
year, and John Roster's average is
283 for three games, 240 for eight,
and 238 for 12 games.
.Mrs. Butterworth is the wife of
H. N. Butterworth, manager oi one
of the oldest mercantile houses in
this city, and is one of Watertown's
social leaders. She took up bowl
ing for diversion and became fasci
nated, iler version of her perform
ance, written especially for The
Press, follows:

Holder of World's High Score
Bowling Record.
So far as I have been able to
ascertain, 245 is the highest score
ever bowled by a woman, and as 1
have rolled three perfect scores, it
haß attracted widespread attention.
I-began bowling in January, 1900,
starting with a small .ball, but
changed to the regulation 16-pound
ball as 1 found my strength suffi
cient.
I was fascinated :at once, al
though I did not do better than ISO
until April, when I rolled 218. I
was anxious to make another 200
score, and did so soon. While not

SAN FRANCISCO, Dec. 7 --Officials of the Central Emer

disappearance from the hospital ambulance of James Doyle of
Oakland, who was supposed to be dying from epilepsy.
So acute was Doyle's case that tbe physicians at the Emer

the city and county hospital. Late last evening an ambulance
was summoned and Doyle was carried carefully from his room.
When the big van arrived at the Infirmary, the stretcher
had been vacated. No attendant had accompanied the sick
man, and how he manuged to leave the ambulance Is a mys

NON-UNION
SWITCHING
CREWS WORK
The week long cry of the Spo
kane merchants has been heard;
their pre-Chrlstmas prayer has been
answered. House tracks in the
yards of the Northern Pacific and
the Great Northern are being
cleared of their empty cars today
and a half dozen switching crews in
each yard are "spotting" carloads
of merchandise to be unloaded.
The merchants, who were in de-
Bpair because of a fear that they
would be unable to secure posses
sion of much of their holiday goods
early enough for the big Christmas
rush, are beginning to smile.
Chief Clerk Walker of the North
ern Pacific, who seems to know
railroad work all the way from A to
Z, is on the job assisting with the
"spotting" of merchandise cars to
day. Reports from Tacoma have it
thnt the Northern Pacific has put
15 nonunion switching crews to
work in the yards there in order
that the merchants may get their
carloads of merchandise unloaded.
Officials of the Northern Pacific
stated today that the embargoes
have been completely lifted from
tfee freight now, that freight of all
kinds is being received for ship
ment to any point on the system
and that tbe freight hous* crew,
which has been idle since the sec
ond day of the strike, will be put
back to work tomorrow.
