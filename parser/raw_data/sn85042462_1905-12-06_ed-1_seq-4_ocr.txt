The president's message, printed in
The Herald this morning, verbatim,
probably ts the longest document of Its
kind in tbe history of the government.
It comes to The Herald as a feature of
the splendid news service of the Asso
ciated Press, the stamp of which is an
assurance of accuracy. Persona who
have had experience in transcontinen
tal telegraphing In the regular way
can form some Idea of the cost of
sending the message at regular rates.
But every day of the year Tho Herald
receives from the Associated Press as
many words of news us are contained
in the nifHKuKe, and often many thou
sands luoi «.
PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE '
Kvery person who Is competent to
express nn opinion on the subject tvIII
agree that the president's message.
which appear* In The Herald this
morning, l«i one of the ablest executlvo
papers ever transmitted to congress.
Although unusually long, It Is well
worth reading carefully and thought
fully from beginning to end. Its style
throughout Is characteristic of the
president, vigorous. Incisive and force
ful. And it leaves no question about
the president's determination to hack
his Ideas on leading Issued by efforts
to secure desired legislation In con
gress.
The message leaves no doubt that
what Is conveniently called the rail
way rate question will be the para
mount Issue at this session. Column
after column of the message is devoted
to It, In connection with cognato ques
tions. The views of tho president are
presented clearly and logically, and
am calculated to convince all persons
who are not Interested directly or Indi
rectly In the policy of railway mo
nopoly.
The president leaves no doubt con
cerning his attitude on tho pivotal
point of the proposition to clothe, the
Interstate commerce commission with
power to regulate freight rates. As
Tho. Herald has heretofore shown, the
real Issue to bo fought oul relates to
the immediate effectiveness of rate
orders that may emanate from the
commission. Tho congressmen who
are expected to lino up on the nldo of
tho railway magnates concede some
extension of power to the commission
In the matter of railway control, be
cause they sec the futility of opposition
to any such extension. But they want
tho orders of the com mission held for
review by the courts before becoming
operative, which would admit of inter
minable delay. The president demands
that "this decision go into effect within
a reasonable time and obtain from
thence onward, subject to review by
the courts."
No adequate comment is possible
here, at this time, upon the single
question of rate control, nor Is it pos
sible even to advert to all the subjects
of interest embodied in the message.
As the labor question Is treated at
length, however, as Its importance de
mands, attention Is called briefly to the
president's general view of the sub
ject.
Alluding to the "demand for depriv
ing courts of the power to issue In
junctions in labor disputes," the presi
dent makes it very clear that he sus
tains tho policy of such Injunctions.
He gives tho timely reminder that "in
any great labor disturbance not only
are employer and employe interested
but also a third party — the general
public." And again, "Individual capit
alist and individual wage-worker, cor
poration and union, are alike entitled
to the protection of. the law."
In this feature of the message which
treats of the relations of capital and
labor the president makes some lu
minous observations: "This govern
ment is not and never shall be gov
ernment by a plutocracy. This gov
ernment is not and never shall be gov
ernment by a mob. It shall continue
to be in the future what it has been in
the past — a government based on the
theory that each man, rich or poor, Is
to be treated simply and solely on his
worth as a man; that all his personal
and property rights are to bo safe
guarded, and that he is neither to wrong
others nor to suffer wrong from
others."
The leading points of the message
will bo considered severally in these
columns.
CALLED BACK
In tho San Francisco Call we find a
fairly considerate review of the citrus
fruit industry in California, particu
larly in relation to culture In northern
and southern, parts o? the state, re
spectively. The article sets out, how
ever, with an obviously illogical state
ment, ascribed to tho state board of
trade. It is to the effect that "all Cali
fornia has the same climate and pro
duction." The state embraces about
six degrees of latitude, and there is
no place on earth where such a range
presents the same climate and produc
tion.
The aim of the (.'all is to show, like,
all its northern contemporaries, that
the so-called northern citrus belt pro
duces earlier and rather better orangei
than are produced in the citrus belt
of the southland. It Is true that In the
exceptionally warm valleys of the
northern orange belt, hedged from
ocean breezes by the mountains, or
anges ripen rather earlier, as a rule,
than they do in tho open citrus belt
of the southland. It in true, also, that
some excellent oranges are produced
there.
But It is an uphill proposition for
the Call, or any other champion of the
northern orange, to argue that it is in
the same class with the southern or
ange. In orange culture, as in most
human activities, results speuk for
themselves. Now it is a well known
fact that oranges were grown In the
northern district long before they be
came a commercial commodity In the
southland. The editor of the Hlver
slde Press, who recently made a close
Inspection of tho citrus fruit Industry
In tho north, says he saw "seedling or
angu trees bearing fruit In Orovllle
that were thlrty-flvo years old." He
says further ,"It seems surprising to
come 700 miles north of ltiveralde by
rail and find oranges nearly a month
earlier than with us, but the condi
tions of greater heat in summer and
warmer nights result In developing an
early orange."
But the Florida orauge ripens earlier
than any of its kind lit California, yet
it la an insignificant factor in the mar.
ket compared with the Southern Cali
fornia product. Much of the Florida
fruit Is excellent, but climatic, condl.
tlons are not favorable to such com
ineiTlul success in orange culture as
fctw been attained In Soutnern Calif ori
LOS ANGELES HERALD 2 WEDNESDAY MORNING, DECEMBER 6, 1905,
nla. Storms and freezing weather are
th« bane of the Florida orange orchard.
There la no reason why thorp should
be any Mttlottl feeling In respect to tho
California orange Industry between
northern mul southern sections. The
southland Is thoroughly satisfied with
the situation and hopes that the 2000
carload annual output of the northern
belt may In time approximate the
present 30,000 carlomi product of the
southern belt.
THE DOCTOR'S GRAFT
In a letter to Tho llornld from one
of Its lady readers some light Is thrown
on tho relation* of physicians with the
patent medlclno business. Tho writer
of tho letter, In visiting a sick neigh
bor, wns told of a. patent medicine that
had been used by thn patient with ex
cellent results. Desiring to obtain 11
bottlo for her own use, tho ludy asked
tho prlco nnd Where It was obtainable,
thn medicine boliiß Imported and bear
ing n French label. Tho patient had
ordered the preparation on tho doctor's
proscription, paying sevrnty-dvn cents
for It, On sending to the drug store
for tho second bottle, without tho pre
scription, the price was fifty conts. To
explain why the llrst bottle cost sev
enty-five cents tho druggist was
obliged to ndnilt that ho added twonty
llve cents to be credited to the doctor,
Justifying the act by saying that it
was "customary."
It seems, therefore, that some physi
cians In addition to their regular
charges for service and their percent
age on compounded prescriptions, also
reap a revenue of one-third on tho
prices of patent medicines that they
recommend, This revenue, in tha eg
gregatc-, must, bo Immense tn Los An
geles, as the practice of recommending
proprietary medicines by doctors is
quite common.
It must require considerable nerve,
even for a physician, to filch from a
patient thirty-three per cent added to
the cost of a patent medicine which he
recommends. The names of all tbe
persons who figure in the incident re
lated above are In The Herald's pos
session.
Here is an object lesson in favor of
the Gothenburg system: An applica
tion for the transfer of a saloon license
owned by brewers was made yesterday,
and it was turned down by the com
missioners. It was claimed that the
license was worth In the saloon mar
ket $9300. The stock of liquors involved
was of the estimated value of $450.
A Boston dispatch says: "Greene peo
ple say they have received samples of
gold ore forwarded from their proper
ties in the Rayon district running
$380,000 per ton in gold and $12,000 In
silver." They must be "green people"
Indeed, as a ton of pure gold weighs
only about $500,000 and $12,000 worth of
silver weighs about 750 pounds.
President Roosevelt said, in explana
tion of his purpose to appoint Franklin
K. Lane as a member of the Inter
state commerce commission, that he
"had no objection to Lane's politics
(Democratic), his object being to find
a man who was neither prejudiced
against railroads nor subservient to
them." ■
It appears to be a fair proposition on
the part of the Los Angeles Railway
company to pay $90,000 toward the
building of a modern steel bridge at
Buena Vista street and Downey avenue
in consideration of the right to use the
bridge for railway services.
The AVashington employing printers
have responded to the union demand
for tho eight-hour system by posting
notices to the effect that with the be
ginning of the new year their establish
ments will be operated ns open shops
on the nine-hour system.
An object lesson fur girls is given in
that case of 11 Chicago stenographer
who has Just come Into possession of
$1,000,000 bequeathed to her by an
uncle "In recognition of her devotion
to her invalid mother."

Benefits of Travel
Travel Is a groat educator. It's vast
ly morn profitable to spend one's monoy
in seeing the world thnn buying a lot
of clothes or useless things with which
to litter up the house. It Is the mo
notony of work that Is killing, not the
work Itself, for we must all be busy
or rust, and Idleness itself Is the hard
est kind of toll. Take your little money
and go on a fine trip; you will be
able to enrn twlrn on much when you
return all frexh and rested.

On Massage
Scientific directions In relation to the
Indications for massitge must nlwoys
be sought from a physician who can
personally observe the case, for It Is
as Impossible to give offhand nccurnte
directions In surgical or medical cases
for tho application of massage as It
would be to give general directions
for a prescription for a patient whom
you have never seen.

When bureau drawers or new doors

the drawer will slide easily, especial

For Flowers
As it is hard to make a few flowers

useful holder and make the arranging
much easier.
Light and Airy Life
AVhen one has tired of the strenuous
life and the simple life (the Intellectual
life doesn't count, as that Is peculiar
to New England), there is still one
more "life" which one may lead, and
that is the "light and airy" life. The
light and airy life hails from London.
Its watchword is lighter food, lighter
drink, lighter furniture, lighter clothes,
lighter jewels, lighter gloves, lighter
shoes, lighter houses, etc.
Glove Purse
Gloves with a small purse for change

the way of a dressy glove Is the long,

length of the wrist.

The late General Isaac J. AVlslar was

Farmer Raises Wild Geese
On the Rainßbarger farm, in Clay
township, and just out of Steamboat
Rock, are being successfully reared and
raised a Hock of nearly seventy fat
wild geese, such bb hunters and sports
men shoot In northern lowa, and the
sight of a tlock of which would please
almost any crack shot In search or
of years ago the Ralnsbar
gers captured a few of a flock of wild
geese which were flying southward one
fall. The wings of the birds were clip
ped, they were corralled for a few
days, Boon began to enjoy captivity
and began to lay eggs. These eggs
were set and in a short time the Rains
burger farm had many young wlbl
geese. The wlngn were kept clipped
and the raising of wild geese became
an occupation for the farmers.— Des

H-tfies and Wck-Ups
Congr ss
A rumbling cornea from Washington,
A gurgling, wordy strain; ■
The clamor sproads thro' all the land.
And echoes back again.
A sound, It is, of clash and roar,
That ono cannot forget.
What Is this wolrd, mysterious noise?
Oh, yes; congress has met!
It will be noted that when Mrs. Bus*
pointed a revolver directly at Deputy
Conant he was the only man who
didn't flee. The inability of a woman
to aim comforted him In the assur
ance of his perfect safety, so long as
she pointed the gun directly at him.
Congress was in session twenty min
utes the first day. "Everybody works
but father" should be amended to In
clude the congressmen.
In view of the state gathering of Bap*
tlsts there, San Berdoo may be said to
be fairly "immersed" in religion just
now.
How did It happen that the two
women who fought In a Los Angeles
office didn't pull hair? Isn't this omis
sion a violation of all tradition?
But the question is, will the czar ab
dicate or wait to be McCurdylzed?
It's always hard luck to be hurt in
a railroad accident, but when persons
so injured are en route from the frigid
east to Los Angeles and are detained
by the smash-up the trouble is almost
unbearable.
Mr. Behymer will hereafter Be-hy'er!
Eh?
Just now Mitchell of Oregon and
Burton of Kansas seem to be paired.
Plum— Going to marry, eh? Any ex
pectations?
Prune — Yes — h er.
Boss Odell of New York says he will
never retire from politics. That's just
what Bobs Cox said.
In the Wrong Car
Recently a Kansas man started for
Denver on a "preacher's ticket," ob
tained at a ticket broker's offico. Tho
conductor took it up because the man
rode in the smoking car. Preachers
don't ride in smoking cars. Hut the
idea of a minister of the gospel "soak
ing" his half-fare permit puzzles the
railroad manager.
The czar is testing autos. .Does ho
want a real, reliable man killer or is
he preparing for the inevitable bomb
and getting used to explosions?
Plttsburg wants a new postoffico.
What's the use? No one could see it
for the smoke.
On an Anniversary
Flvo years we've, hand in hand.
Walked life's highway, '
Meeting Its least demand,
Coming each day.
Flvo years, dear Heart 0' Mine,
Thro' sun and rain,
Crowned with Ood's love, wo'vo asKei?
Flvo years! Tho blessings shed
Too many are
Even to count! Kach one,
A mem'ry's star!
God,, in Thy-mercy, grant,
Out of Thy store,
Thut wo together live
Fifty years more!
