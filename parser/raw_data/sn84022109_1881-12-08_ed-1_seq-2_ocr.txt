REDUCTION OF TAXATION
ThtH who read the presidents
message yesterday will notice that
he deprecates the steady accnmula
tion of surplus revenues More
thin this he suggests measures to
oiviate snch accumulations rightly
deeming a u = ele cash balance an
evil rather than a blessing There
can be little doubt but congress will
heed the presidents suggestions and
that during the present session there
will be legislation providing for a
diminution of revenue taxation
Democrats and republicans may not
be fully agreed as to the details of
= uch legislation but democrat and
republicans alike will concede that
it is in order and once there
is harmony on this point
it will not be difficult to unite on the
details May we not hope that here
in Texas the presidents sagacious
suggestions will be repeated Our
state government is accumulating
ha already accumulated a sura of
money wrung from overtaxed peo
ple that 1b altogether useles and
idle We have a million of dollars
rusting in the treasury at Austin
that is inapplicable to any constitu
tional requirement It cannot be
returned to the people who paid it
nor can it be applied to the reduc
tion of the states bonded indebted
ness save at extravagant rates The
experiment ou ht to satisfy those
who are iu power The democratic
party ought to present some
better policy than piling up hundreds
ofthousands of useless money and
that too without reducing taxation
It is true theadvalorem tax has been
dimmihed but onerous occupation
taxe till exist There is a remedy
and if Governor Koberts has true
moral courage he will a sc the legi
Uture to apply the remedy It
is to ubmit constitutional amend
ments to popular vote providing for
a repeal ot that article iu he organic
law making the rate of county and
local taxation contingent on the rate
ami maintained by the
tate Iiglit here is where the
difficulty lunges ana the remedy
t plain There wa3 a time when
the unthinking masses worshipped
the < ash balauce It wa the boa t
and pride of the administration
That lime has paeed now and
thoe who are in authority had at
well look facts squarely in the face
The people want laws that will en
able the state to reduce taxation

taxes a ma lie demanded by their
