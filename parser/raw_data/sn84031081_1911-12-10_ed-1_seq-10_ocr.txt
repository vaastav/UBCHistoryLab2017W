Next year, for the rirat time, (he
people of New Mexico will cat their
xctea for a prealtlent of the United
Btatea, They will also elect mem
ber of the houne of representative.
Whether thl vote will be cot for the
republican or the democratic candi
date depend In larg meaiure
upon the attitude of the men who
have heretofore amumed to b the
lead era of the party.
Indication! already point to a con
tinued effort on the part of Messrs.
Luna, Ituraum, Andrews and othera of
that Ilk, to control the political dentin
lea of the republican party. Jutt now
these men are trying to make It ap
scar that they control the federal pat
ronag in New Mexico by placing the
seal of their endorsement Upon men
they know to h favored by the prel
dent. This effort will fall. The peo
ple of New Mexico know only too well
that the candidates for federal JiMp"
and Vnltcd State district attorney
endorsed by Delcgal Andrew and
lr. Luna have nothing In common
with either the delegate or the nation
al committeeman. They know that
neither Judge Pope nor Mr. Stephen
8. Davis, Jr., need any cudoraemcnt
from auch men as Andrew ami Luna.
They know that the eiideraenittit ol
Xleiwra. Andrews sud . Luu.a.1 suffi
cient to damn any.nandiilut who hui
not the good fortune to be personally
Jsnowji to and enjoy the high regard
of the president. For theae rruaona It
la extremely unlikely that either Mr,
Andrews or Mr, Luna will add to
their prenllge by bothering Mr. Taft
with recommendation retarding ap
pointments of olher affairs In New
Mexico.
Mr. Lunn'i record as manager of
the late and, to the republican party,
disastrous campaign In New Mexico, !
not such an to endear him to (he
president or to the leader of the
party In the nation. Mr. Andrews un
fortunately for hlmseir, la well known
In Washington, and discriminating
office seekers have learned to culti
vate his enmity rather than hi
f rlendHhlp.
l!ut, notwithstanding his record, Mr.
Andrews la a candldato fur the United
Htates senate from New Mexico, and
Mr. Luna, while nut personally a can
lildalo, Is aald to harbor an ambition
to name nt least one of thn senators.
Mr. Lima's candidate Is Holm O. Itur
eum of Hooorro. fcatcd in his effort
to force Mr litirsum down the throats
if the people of New Mexico as llielr
governor, Mr. Luna, la aald to cherish
mi aint.ltloii o make the legislature
led ,iH protege t the high office ol
enator of the United States. It ma
tie safely predicted that hr. Luna will
recover from this ambition and be
oiitent to retire gracefully to the ob
livion to which thn people of New
Mexico have consigned Ills candidate
for goernor.
It is i,Ml,l(. that Mr. Andrews has
few friends In both houses of the
legislature, and It la known that there
are a number of members who are In
debted to tlie delegate fer contrilni
tlons toward their campaign expenses,
l)Ut the constituents of them' men
should see to It that they do nut pay
their political debt" by voting f(r the
unspeakable niie for I'nit.-d states

The republicans of New Mexico,

tllWciM; THK WORLD'S MAPS.
The piteous appeal of Persia against
being divided up by Great Pritain
and liussU, the struggle between
Turkey and Italy fur the puaaun
of Tripoli, the civil r la Chin, and
the faces being made at one another
by England and Germany, with the
Intimation that the latter soon will
g ve England a cnance 10 snow ner
good ill Uh respect to some Ger
man ambition In Africa, bring into
the limelight the Industrious new
map-making in which several of th
nations are at present engaged.
Not alnce one hundred year r so
ago, when the new world maps made
by Napoleon had their outlines again
changed, has mankind teen so busy
mussing up the geographies aa at
present. Just what will be the out
come In Persia no one can tell, but
In the present delicate situation of
affairs In Europe It would seem that
Great Itrttaln and Russia will be
allowed to do pretty much as they
ike there. Turkey, It Is true, has ap
pealed to the powers in favor of Per
sian Independence, but as Turkey s
Interest In the matter probably con
sist! only in wanting a small slice of
the Shah's dominions herself, her
protest may be withdrawn if her de
sires are satisfied.
Should Persia dl&apear from the
list of independent countries, a work
of conquest will have been complet
ed that, ao far, has attracted little
general attention. On the whole sur
face of the globe there will then re
main uncouipiered by the powers
which' may be regarded as the off
shoots of the ancient lioman empire
only China, Japan and Turkey. All
the rest will lie under th shadow
of the cross which In the early cen
turies followed the lioman eagle ov
er Europe, and which sines the Ro
man empire fell has been triumph
antly carried to every region of the
earth, ,
Tripoli Is now practically Italian
territory and will remain so unless
the wild tribesmen of the interior
are able to recapture it With the
improbability of re-enforeemcnta be
ing sent to Turkey, this seems unlike
ly. With Tripoli belonging to Italy,
th entire line of the south border of
the Mediterranean will com under
the rule of white nations.
France, with her free hand In
Morocco, has suddenly gained the
trip of northeastern Africa from the
Pillura of Hercules to the point
where the I'raha empties Into the
Atlantic. And th Paris press re
joice because, as on paper recent
ly asserted, the "adjustment with
Germany creates a great French em
pire In North Africa,'
Another change In , the world's
mapa also was mad by the French
German agreement. Part of., .th
Fitiio.il Congo, far toMh southward
of th tiuhara, ia iiaudud over to
Germany, while Germany cede to"
France her "duck hills," stretching
from the Chart river to th Legona.
Thus the map of the Dark Continent,
o far um It Is represented by Euro
pean possessions and protectorates.
Is changed at several points, '
In the Orient what may result
from the revolution In China ha yet
to be determined. Even If the Middle
Kingdom Is preserved Intact, there Is
no telling what may happen to. Man
churia whether It will be Chinese,
Flusslan or Japanese, That there will
be need of some new maps there, aa
there Is now In Europe and Africa,
seems assured.

It Is not siiaugfl that to many per
sons, convinced of the fact that every
Individual l the summation of his
ancestors, research Into antecedent
and collateral relationships proves a
subject of absorbing Interest amount
lug sometimes to a ruling passion. It
Is well for the student of heredity and
eugenics In their application to his
own family ami his personal social
statua to bear lu mind that great
ness of solil or Intellect In a remote
ancestor does not argue slmi'iir uual
Ifieatlona in a descendant In our own
time; today's scion of many a proud
name represents ft sad declension, and

There are societies In America bas
ed on tin' principle of ancestor wor
ship. If their motivation is nothing
more than this, they do not desYrve to
exist. It lx nut to a man's credit to
he born lino the world; he has no
volition In the matter. The fact of
descent from sin li an one. who bore
himself valorous!)- in battle two Ceil
ttuies ago, or unothcr who had the
good Kcti.se lo emigrate to America
before there were customs and quar
antine, does not In Itself provide a
warrant for social adliealou In an or
ganization with ancestry as the prime
qualification for membership. Such
societies have their useful function
when they Inculcate patriotism, when
they guard such historic shrines and
Institutions as we have from the pil
lage, and sacrilege of iallce dumestlc
or foreign levy. They are of no par
ticular use when they meet only to
glorify themselves or to burn incense
to the notion that their members are
et apart from ordinary mortals by
the mere tail of alleged superior
lie Till.

After year of dilatory, dilly-dallying
deliberation and debate th Unit
ed State has the postal savings Ink,
We proceeded sloly and cautiously
through an experimental period, act
ing a if the idea might contain nitro
glycerin. Reassured after a few tests
In a few out-of-the-way experimental
poetoffices over th country, the pos
tal savings bank ha been distributed
more and more widely until th as
surance is with us that the govern
ment at Washington still Uvea and
that comparatively few banks have
been blown inward from th effect of
th law' operation.
However, the old eompanlon-piec
of thla Idea th parcel post long
has been hanging face to th wall In
congressional cooling rooms. Occaa
sionally the people have been remind
ed that this piece of proposed legisla
tion la In cold storage, well preserved
and out of all danger from fir. In
the meantime, however, the great ex
press companies of the country have
been paying rich dividends upon
stock that have grown enormously
above par value. Representatives in
congress have expressed themselves as
concerned immediately over the mag
nitude of the expreas business In this
country. Proposals have been made
that the railroad be forced to take
over the business of the express com
panies and so bring the business un
der the direction of the Interstate
Commerce Commission.
Now that congress again Is In ses
sion and before it has had opportun
ity to act or not to act on the matter
of a parcel poat. Collier' weekly
make the following uncolored an
nouncement, dropping the topic within-
paragraph:
"The editor of the Illlnot Farmer
ha received from President Taft's sec
retary a letter which close with thl
sentence: The president Is strongly In
favor of the establishment of a gen
eral parcels poat and will recommend
th same without qualification in his
next message. Th democratic lead
ers In the lower house also favor the
parcel post and the new chairman of
the senate committee on poetoffices Is
ardently promoting It."
The parcels post Is no longer an ex
periment. To the extent that the
United State mail now carry parcel
of limited alse and weight, th system
la proved. To the extent that the
United States malls carry packages of
larger dimension and great weights
which have originated outside our
own territory In other countries In the
International postal union, th system
la accepted. Fears of the mall mer
chant as to the workfng out of th
system must prove aa absurd a were
the fears of the great bank of the
country when the postal savings bank
were Inaugurated, ,
y9 await President Taft'i message
in unqualified endorsement of the
parcel post measure. With much
more concern, however, we shall have
to wait for congress' action or Inac
tion upon it.
"You are perfect In every way ex
cept one, aald the novelist George
Randolph Chester to the wife who
divorced him. "Thl woman,'' he
added, "surpasses you In beauty, I
must have that. My nature demands
It my soul crlea out for It." If Chest
er's soul had done It trying out be
fore he got married, he would have
had more general aympathy. A wom
an who I perfect In every way ex
cept In physical beauty Is a jewel that
ought not lightly to be thrown away.

"will not support any one for the
