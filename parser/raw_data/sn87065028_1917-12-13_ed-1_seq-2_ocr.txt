THE RED CROSS DRIVE.
A drive for money iuid members for the American
Red Cross Society is about to be inaugurated in Lowndes
county, and the Commercial confidently be!ieve3 that th-.
people of the county will respond In the same generous
sprit that has marked their tttitude towards similar calls
which VinvA hopn made it on Hum in behalf of various
activities since the United States severed diplomatic re
lations with Germany.
Mr. W. N. Puckett, chairman of the Lowndes Cour.
ty Red Cross Chapter, has named Mr. Jesse P. Woo.
ward to direct the drive, and no better man could pos...
bly have been sele-K.ed. Mr. Woodward is not only ex
tremely patriotic but possesses rare business acumen,
and will organize his for i.'s in such a manner that th
success of the campaign is assured.
Mr. Parker Reeves has been named as treasurer c
the fund, and this too, is an admirable selection. M
Reeves demonstrated h s ti'j.hty as a money-getter in th
recent Liberty Loan Campaign, and w.ll undoubted .
render equally efficient service in the pend n campa.g
As an ageniy for promptly and effectually alleviat
ing human suffering the Amer can Red Cross Society
unquestionably the greatest organiz-itum in the worl,
Its efficiency was recently demonstrated at Hal fax, rep
resentatives of the soe.ety having been the first in the
field to give succor to victims of the terrible holocaust
The organization is indeed worthy of the most enthu
siastk support, and the ponding call for -aid should, an
doubtless will meet with a most 1 beial response.

GRAFTERS AT WORK,.
Federal officials are making things exceedingly ho
for unscrupulus gTafters who are using war charitie
and war contracts as an ill gitimate menus of mak'm
money. Several wreeks ago a bazaar was held in Nev
York for pseudo charitable purposes, and while the re
ceipts amounted to $70,000 only $7f0 was turned ovj
to the organization which was supposed to be the bene
ficiary. The arrest of the man who had charge of th
undertaking speed.ly followed, and now William L
Thorn, J. J. Slattery and Joseph Ives have been indicted
by a federal grand jury in the same city on a charge o
conspiracy to defeat the government out of hundreds o
thousands of dollars in nnect'on with a contract fo
the manufacture of one million service hats for Amer
can soldiers.
In a recent issue of the Saturday livening Post
Isaac G. Marcasson has an interesting article dealinj
with the plan followed by the Knuii;-h government ii
the purchase of army supplies, and (he two cases cited
above indicate that a s'miltir plan oueht to lie adopter
in the United States. In England each contract i
awarded on a per centage basis instead of for a lump
sum; and the government, in order to guard ngains
fraud, has inspectors who visit the different factorie;
engaged in making supplies and who check up pay rolls,
bills for raw material and other financ'al details which
' show exactly what it costs to produce every article fur
nished.
After the prices paid for raw material and labor
have bce.tf CSBUdaei, the co-k-?imcTrt. allow? th manu

pursuing this method English officials have mads is possi

NO EARLY PEACE.
Judge Harris Dickson, who is generally rccoj,rze
as one of Mississippi's most brilliant journal. sts anc
short story writers, has recently returned from a trip to
Europe, and," like practically all other Americans who
have visited foreign battle fields, declares that there is
lU.e hope for early peace.
In an interview given out soon after he reached h.s
home in Vicksburg Judge Dickson said:
"The French and allied forces deplore the Russia
s tuation, and all realize that a separate peace will mca.
the release of approximately 2,000,000 Germans an.
Austrian prisoners of war. This will materially increas
the strength of the German foHes and will mean just
that many more men that the allies will have to deu.
with," he stated.
. Judge Dickson is of the opinion that the aeroplant
is a very effective weapon of war, and were it possible
to exterminate entirely all of the German machines, it
would mean a very decisive blow in favor of the allied
forces. Both England and the United States appreciate
this fact thoroughly, he stated.
"It is remarkable the number of soldiers that th
United States has landed in France since the declaration
of war," Judge Dickson stated. "They are all makinj;
the best of the situation, living clean lives, and while
none of these expeditionary forces have yet seen actuu
service, they are permitted '.tertain privileges, and an
ow receiving their first lessons in modern warfare," hi
added.
"Nothing is too good for those boys 'over there,'
tnd every true American citizen should not hesitate to
Jo his or her bit toward winning the war, whatsoever it
nay be," Judge Dickson stated.
Much of his time was spent in delivering lecture
the American "Sammies," whom he found to be goo
I'steners.

An appeal to the farmers of Mis
sissippi has been issued by W. H.
Smith, vice-chairman state council
of defense, K. Wilson, state agent
and assistant director, with the re
quest that the newspapers see thai
it reaches the farmers m their terri
tory, saying, "As it is only tnrougn
you that we can hope to reach them
all."
The appeal is as follows:
To the farmers of Mississippi s
The most patriotic ana proDably
the most proiitable thing Mississipp.
xarmers can do now is to prepare
to . iiKfrease their hog crops 100 per
cent.
It now seems that in the last
analysis the nations richest in fats
and pork will be the victors.
We must have more hogs is the
call, not for the consumers of the
country, but for our army, and loi
Belgium, France, England and Italy,
This striking statement from vht
nation makes .us wonder if we art
really doing all we can. ' The whoi.
allied wond and the neutral art
now looking to the United States fo.
help as the bulwark against world
wide famine. From Finland we havt
news that the people are on tht
verge of starvation and are now sub
sisting on a bread made largely Oi
edible bark. Wheat production ii
France is off 50 per cent, all food
3tuffs short 35 per cent and earnesi
appeals have just come from French
authorities for more food. Sweden
is issuing n bread ration 25 per cen
below that given to the German peo
pie. In Denmark and Norway theu
are not six months supplies on hand
Switzerland .and Holland are wholly
dependent on us.
The wheat stc.ks of the work
have been reduced to the smaller,
amount ever known. Flock3 am
herds are geratly diminished as L
particularly the case in Denmark
whoso mngnificient herds are now
being deliberately destroyed, and ii
Helium while the pig is rapidly
disappearing.
Mr. Hoover has tackled a proL
lem greater than that undertake,
heretofore by any single man. Ti
him a dozen- nations are coming a
their one hope to preserve the
people from actual starvation.
To' help feed these countries a.
well as to furnish food for th
f armies in the field Mr. Hoover ha
asked Mississippi to raise more hogs
and more hogs.
Some form of pork seems to b(
essential to an efficient army and
large quantities are now needed f 0,
the American soldiers. .
Once recognlzjng the great need
of more hogs, Mississippi farmers
will need no assurance of a minimum
pri"e for this product, yet assurance
is given by Mr. Hoover that a rig!d
control of the packers will be es
tablished and so far as the Food Ad
ninistration can help the price of
average hogs will not N go below
$15.60 a hundred weight on the
Chicago market. The normal price
of hogs will be 100 pounds of-hogs
to equal in price 13 bushels of corn.
So if corn should go on to $2.00 a
bushel on the Chicago market hogs
will automatically go to .$25 a hui
dred.
This as you see will yield a big
return for a patriotic service.
" A litter of eight pigs, farrowed in
March or April and sold in Decem
ber at 9 or 10 months old, when they
should weigh 250 pounds earn, wi'i)
weigh a total of 2,000 pounds. Eve 1
at the lowest figure of $15.50 a hun
dred, these pigs will bring in $310,
and you will take much less land
and labor to produce feed for these
pigs, than it will to raise two bales
of cotton, and the profits will be
much greater. All over Mississippi
there are nice young gilts that are
now in fattening pen to be marketed
or put into the smoke house. So far
as your influence goes will you see
that these gilts are saved and bred
luring December?
. Help the pig club boys to keep
their gilts and sows or to sell them
to some one who w 11 breed 'hem
By doing these things to the best of
our ability and do ng them quickly,
ou are sending reinforcements di
rectly to the boys at the front.
Aricnic Supply Will be Needed For
Iniecticidet.
In placing the arsenic industry
under the tontrol of the food ad
ministration, the President has acted,
in answer to the threatened short
age in the supply of arsenical In
secticides. Since arsenic is the active agc.t
in potato-bug poison, the farmer .s
dependent upon an adequate supp.y
of arsenic compounds for con
the potato bug. It is considered 'm
portant that a supply of white a
senic be available to meet the needs
next .year for grasshopper "control.
It is also necessary for control of
cutworms and army worms.
