PRESIDENT WILL NOT
ANY HARM TO COME
BY TAV.
(Special Correspondence of The Argus.)
Washington, Dec. 5. President Taft
has served notice that he will not allow
any harm to come to "Uncle Joe" Can
nor or the house rules.
The president is telling visitors that
he Is not in any way concerned with
the fight to be made upon the speaker
and rules, but that if that fight threat
ens to interfere with the enactment of
his legislative program, then he will
take a hand not to save the speaker,
but to secure legislation outlined in
his message.
The insurgents are recalling that this
is practically the same position the
president took during the previous fight
on Cannonlsm and the old rules, which
occurred soon after the opening of the
special session March 4.
At that time the speaker was on the
verge of being dethroned, and the
house rules In serious danger of being
improved through a coalition of dem
ocrats and progressives when the
president intervened. The president
utilized every source of power at his
command to perpetuate Cannonlsm and

after she had been given possession.

prevent a revision of the rules. The
president assigned Postmaster General
Hitchcock and others of his best steam
roller fighters to help "Uncle Joe," with
the result that the democratic-progressive
combination was in vain.
Feared Delay, He Said.
The president's explanation was' that
it was far from his purpose to stand in
the way of better rules, but that it was
hlsfuiiMon that if Speaker Cannon
showMBSSte unseated and the rules
changed just at that time, it might
have a tendency to delay or otherwise
interfere with the making of a tariff
bill that would conform to his promise
to the people.
The president now takes a very sim
ilar position as regards a fight against
Cannon and the rules at this session.
He talked the situation over with Rep
resentative Boutelle of Chicago at con
siderable length- Boutelle is one of
the most zealous defenders of Cannon
lsm, a willing worker In the house or
ganisation, and a stalwart advocate jof
specfal privileges, especially to the
beef trust and kindred organizations in
Chicago.
DENEEN CALLS
THE LEGISLATURE
Requests 46th Illinois Assembly
to Meet Next Tuesday at
Springfield.
AND OUTLINES MUCH WORK
Submits 24 Propositions Which He
Urges lie Given Attention Pri
mary Election Law First.
Springfield, III., Dec. 7. Governor
Deneen .last night issued a call for the
f46th- general assembly-of Illinois, to
assemble Dec. 14, next Tuesday. He
submits 24 separate and distinct prop
ositions to it.
In the message which he will trans
mit to the legislature the governor,
for practical purposes, reopens the reg
ular session, which went to smash last
spring, having elected William Lor'I
mer to the United States senate.
The governor hurls a bomb of im
pressive dimensions into the ranks of
the politicians, who have figured upon
a ladylike agreement over a deep wa
terway bill and something about a pri
mary law.
Work for Legislature.
Instead of these two propositions,
which have been discounted considera
bly by the work which has been per
formed in anticipation of such execu
tive requests, the governor asks for
most of those things which ought to
have been done and which were not
done by the regular session. In short,
Governor Deneen demands that the
general assembly get on the job and
earn the salaries which It has collected.
The 24 points which Governor Deneen
specifies in his call follow:
1. To enact a primary election law
governing nominations made by politi
cal parties.
2. To enact a corrupt practices act
governing caucuses and primaries by
political parties and elections.
Change Reglntrntion Sj-niem.
3. To amend the act in relation to
boards of election commissions in cities
with respect to the manner of appoint
ment of judges and clerks and to
amend said act with reference to reg
istration for special elections and for

ALLOW
TO CANNON
When Mr. Boutelle had finished his
interview with the president, he ex
pressed the conviction that Speaker
Cannon would prove his loyalty to the
present administration at this session.
He said that he was convinced the
speaker would do all within his power
to secure the passage of legislation rec
ommended by President Taft.
Boutelle added that in his opinion
"Uncle Joe" was distinctly an Abra
ham Lincoln type of statesman.
Taking the hint from the president,
the standpatters are declaring that all
who attempt to seat a new speaker or
Interfere with the present rules are to
be regarded as obstructionists. As a
matter of fact, however, there is no
more likelihood that Cannon and Aid
rich intend to aid in the enactment of
progressive legislation than there was
probability that they would frame and
pass an honest tariff bill. The coun
try is familiar with what the Cannon
Aldrich crowd did with the Taft tariff
promises. What grounds are there to
base the hope they will do any better
by the recommendations in the presi
dent's message ?

Accused of Having Speculated With

Xew York, Dec 7. The fact that
George P. Sheldon la bo ill at his home
in Connecticut that he is expected to
die will not cause the abandonment of
the criminal investigation and prose
cution in the matters of the Phoenix
Insurance company of Brooklyn, from
the presidency of which Sheldon was
removed at the instigation of the state
Insurance department. The superin
tendent of the insurance company de
clared in his report that the Phoenix
Insurance company, through its presi
dent, had been in the habit of loaning
considerable sums to state insurance
officials, and that for 22 years the com
pany has not been investigated by the
department. Four state insurancofii
clals. are mentioned whosp loans from
the Phoenix aggregate $2(10,000.
The insurance department believes
the company's risks to the public are
not involved and the entire loss
through the loans negotiated by Shel
don can be balanced by crossing off
$1,000,000 of the company's $3,000,000
surplus.
