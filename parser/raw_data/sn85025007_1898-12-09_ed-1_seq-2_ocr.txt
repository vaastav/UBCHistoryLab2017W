FEI DAY EVENING, DEC. 9, 1*0
No WONDER the Spanish government
protests against the gratuitous insult
Pr?sident McKinley has oilered it, by
reiterating the ex parte charge that the
destrustion of the Maine was attributa?
ble to Spain. The fact that both Spain
and her peace commissioners have pro?
posed to submit the Maine aflair to the
arbitrament of an international and dis?
interested commission, and that that
proposition has been rejected by bo-b
this government and its peace commis?
sioners, induces many people to doubt
the findings of a jury composed entire?
ly of American officers, uaturally inter?
ested ia the reputation of the service
iu which they are employed and in tLe
welfare of their fellow officers.
To establish a uniform rule of natu?
ralization is one of the powers confer
red upOD Congress, by the Constitution:
but, according to the Hawaiian bib
now before Congress, the negroes, Kan?
akas and half breeds of the Sandwich
Islands are to be admitted to citizen?
ship, though the old Chinese and Jap?
anese residents of the islands are to b~
excluded. The excluded class are
educated and intelligent. Are the
Northern filibusters, for whose profit
the islands were annexed, afraid that
such people will see through their
tricks and expose them ?
Secretary Algeb has refused to al
low the testimony taken in the Wirz
trial to be published in the so-called
'Records of the Rebellion." Why,
certainly not, for such testimon;
proves conclusively that Capt. Wirz
was no more responsible for the death
of any federal soldier at Andersonville
than Secretary Alger himself was, ana
t'iat his murder was as foul and dis?
graceful as was that of Mrs. Surratt.
The great wonder about the so-called
4,record6"referred to, is that the ex Con?
federates employed in preparing them
should continue to be engaged in any
such work.
General Fitz Lee says "the Ameri?
can army is going to Cuba to help thr
people there to set up an independei;1.
government of their own. "As the Spin -
iards are leaving the island as rapidly
as possible, and will all be goue in :
month or two, there is nothing to pre?
vent the Cabaus from seating up aa ic
dependent government of their own
now,except their own u':ter andentire in?
competence and inefficiency; but, judg?
ing the future by the past, the last sol?
dier in the American army will be det<(!
and buried bafore-those disqualifica?
tions will be removed.
According to the fundamental lav
of the land, no authority is conferred
upon Congreas to conquer and hold for?
eign territory for colonization purposes,
and as the same law provides that the
powers not delegated to the United
States by the Constitution are reserve !
to the States or the people, the pro?
posed retention of the recently con?
quered provinces as colonies, uudir
military governors, is unconstitutonal.
But, as a renegade New York ex Con?
gressman used to say, what is tho Con?
stitution among friends ?
The Constitution provides that no
Senator or Representative shall during
the term for which he was elected be
appointed to any civil office under the
authority of the United States, which
shall have been created during such
term. Iu the face of this provision, it
would seem, were it not for the preva?
lent imperialistic idea, that Senator.;
Hoar and Vest are right in objecting to
the appointment of U.S. Senators as
?. S. Commissioners.
Count A. von Goetzen the
attache of the German Embassy tt
Washington, who accompanied tho
American army to Cuba, says th.ut
among all the insurgents in CubB, he
did not see a single white mau except
among the officers. But the filibusters
before and during the war, said the?0
?were comparatively few negroes among
She insurgents, and General Fitzhugh
Lee, himself, said all the white people
he saw in Cuba were in favor of the in?
surgents. _
The U. S. Supreme Court has decid?
ed that "the United States, under the
present Constitution, cannot acquire
territory to be held as a colony, to bo
governed at their will and pleasure."
But, what is the Constitution or a deci?
sion of the U S. Supreme Court, to peo?
ple who hope to profit themselves in?
dividually by the new policy of expan?
sion ?
To Buy the PHiupprj^.-Senator
Kyle, of bouth Dakota, is authority for
the statement, which he declares he
makes on semi-official authority, that
Japan has offered this government
$200,000,000 for .'he Philippine Islands.
He says that therO i8 a distinct senti?
ment in official circles in favor of event?
ually turning the islands ovs" to Japan
or to some other power or powers.
These statements are given some
weight by the fact that yesterdav Sen- i
ator Kyle had an interview with the
president concerning the policy in the !
?Philippines. President McKinley is!
represented to be in favor of selling the i

Washington, Dec. y.
The city of MontEomery, Ala., was
to-day included in the liet of cities to
be visited by the President during his
southern trip. He will be at Mont?
comery od Friday from 3 to 5 p. m.
General Lawton has been added to the
membership of the Presidential party.
General Wheeler and his daughter will
also go along. The General is the only
member of Coogress that has been in?
vited. Ke is now on the most familiar
terms at the White House.
General Garcia is ill with pneumonia,
and as he is nearly sixty-three years
old, his life is in greatest daDger. Col.
Gomez is also ill, and so the business
of the Cuban commission here is mak?
ing no progress.
Pension Commissioner H. Clay
Evans agrees with Senator Vest on the
"too many pensioners" proposition,
and says he hopes Mr. Vest will push
the matter through. There are a few
members of Congress who lay back,
watch their chance and rush through
bunches of bills while the others are
not looking and then the men who do
not ::et their claims through are mad
clea?: through. There are altogether
too many private pension bills passed
by Congress, he says, and he will be
very glad to see the system stopped or
abridged.
The interview published in Washing?
ton and New York this morning with
General Joe Wneeler of Alabama, mak
iug him say he would resign his seat in
the House, caused much surprise. The
general's attention was called to it. He
said : "The interview is entirely erron?
eous. All I have eaid, is I
will give the mat^-r a careful
iuvenigation, when I have time
,o do so. but as yet 1 have ccme to
;io determination, whatever. With
regard to the statement that
I am fere as an advocate of
army legislation to which the democratic
party is opposed, I desire to say that it
.3 not true the democratic party is op?
posed to army legislation. Tbe demo?
cratic party recognizes as well as the
republican party the necessity for a re?
gular army. It recognizes the changed
condition of our country in the last six
months, and that we are to-day tbe
threat power of the world. It would
be a crime to fail to legislate intelli?
gently on the subject of the army."
The general said further that it was his
belief Spain would not have warrtd
with us," had we had a large standing
army. She thought with her 300,000
soldiers she could easily whip the
United States with our 25,000.

T le army bill provides for an army of

President to enlist recruits in the con?
quered provinces without requiring of

Samuel G. Young, 50 years old, and
well known in social and musical rir
cles in Washington, made an ucsuc
cessful attempt to end his life by swal?
lowing about two ounces of laudanum
last night. The attempt to end his life
had been frequently threatened by
Young. He had been addicted to the
drink habit for some time. Recently
Young was attacked with delirium
tremens, and yesterday was in a rather
critical condition. The act of la3t
night was the culmination of a pro?
tracted spree and a series of wrongdo
ings. The latter, it is said, included
the forging of the name of Justice
Bradiey to numerous checks for vari
ous amounts. These acts of ingratitude
toward his benefactor have been goiun
on for some time, and the justice, ac?
tuated by a purely humane motive,
and his intense interest iu the man, on
each occasion made good the amount-1
involved.
DAUGHTERS OF THE REVOLU?
TION.
At yesterday's session in Norfolk of
the State Conference of the Daughters
of the American Revolution the ques?
tion of the furnishing by Virginia
Daughters of a room in the house of
the superintendent of the Mary Wash?
ington monument, at Fredericksburg,
was settled by reference to a com
mittee of five, to be appointed.
The next business was the consid?
eration of matters regarding the
proposed building to be erected in
Washington, where the Daughters will
establish a national headquarters. Mrs.
Albert D. Brocketr, of thie city, stated
that there is already the sum of $44,000
ia hand toward tbe building, and tha:
there are many valuable relics, now in
the Smithsonian Institution and the Na?
tional Museum, at Washington, which
will be put in the new building, to ba
known as Continental Hall.
A call of chapters was made, and a
representative of each chapter was
heard as to probable amounts which
could be raised toward the Continental
Hall fund. Various amounts, from $10
to $100, were promised.
A number of amendments to thf
constitution of tho National Society, D.
A. R., were then taken up and consider
ured at length. Various instructions in
the matter were prepared for the guid
ance of the Virginia delegates to tho
next national congress, to be held in
Washington, beginning February 22,
1899.

Mount Vernon Chapter, Alexandria,

Will Leave Congress.?Maj. Gee
Joseph Wheeler will resign his seat in
Congress and retain his commission in
the army. Gen. Wheeler made his de?
cision yesterday as the result of the
question raised as to the legality of his
holding two positions under the United
States government. In an iuterview
Gen. Wheeler stated that he had heard
of the objections raised to his continu?
ance as a member of Congress while he
held a commission in the volunteer
army. He had considered the matter
carefully and decided to resign from
Congress and retain his commission.
The General says:
"I prefer the army life to the life
of a member of Congress. I am full of
life as a soldier and but a grayrhaired
man as a civilian. I feel as young as
when I was a boy, and although some
little discussion has been raised as to
my age, I hope soon to be old enough
to make a good soldier." The General
will probably be commissioned in tbe
regular army and continue in active
service until retired.

ASKED FOR PAYMENT.
An urgent demand bus been made on
tbe comptroller of the currency i'jr $3,
OOo, due the Commonwealth ofVirginia
for money advanced during the Span?
ish war.
The comptroller was informed that
there was so much delay in equipping
the Virginia troop3 with shoes and un?
der-clothing that President; McKinley
authorized Governor Tyler to nuke
certain purchases, promising him that
the federal government would refund
whatever monty might be paid our.
Acting upon the authority of the Presi?
dent, Governor Tyler had Colonel Cou -
linu to make contracts aggregatin? $3,
000. The money w<is paid out of the
State treasury and the comptroller de
clioes to refund it, on the grouud
that he holds more than half a million
dollars' worth of Virginia bonds which
should have been paid long ago.
In the letter of the Virginia officials
they say not to pay this chum would
be a great outrage; that the federal
government was so slow in equipping
troops that the governor, as a favor to
the President aud the War Department,
had them clothed, and that he may be
held personally responsible for this
money by tbe legislature uuleis it is re
funded.
The officials furnish tho comptroller
with a brief history of Virgiuia ciaiin-?
against the government which more
than offset the value of the bonds.
RESIGNED TO HER FATE.

Spanish government on Wednesday de?

Rios, president of the Spanish peace
commission at Paris, instructing him to
again protest against President McKin
ley's reference to the Maine in his re?

the Imparcial says there is great indig?
nation at the American commissioners'
rejection of Senor Rios's request for a
neutral investigation into tbe cause of
the loss of tbe Maine. Spaniards say
it is adding insult to injury, and taking
unfair advantage of circumstances to
deny justice to a nation which is un?

"Spain has been treated by the con?

Not Opposed to Expansion.?Arch?
bishop Chappelle, the recently-appoint?
ed papal delegate to the newly-ac?
quainted American possessions, in a
-peech at New Orleans recently made
several interesting and significant state?
ments. Among other things he said:
"The Holy See is above mere politi?
ck considerations. The concern of the
Holy Seo and of the Catholic Church is
pr.ni irily the salvation of souls and the
furtherance of Christian civilization.
Therefore, such* writers who have tried
to induce the people to believe that the
Holy Father was opposed to the Ameri?
can policy of expansion wrote that
wnich was not true, and I so informed
tho President. The Holy Father has
nothing to do with politics or witb the
American policy of expansion. All that
the Catholic Church seeks is the salva?
tion of souls and tho promotion of so?
cial happiness."
She Raised the Flag Over a Pig
Pen.?For protecting her pig pen from
the encroachments of a rapacious quar
ryman, Mrs. Bridget Kelly, of Conaho
hocken, Pa., stood trial in court on
Wednesday. The quurryman was Jas.
B^atty. He wanted to use tbe site
where Mrs. '"Kelly had her pig house,
and ordered John Biake, an employee,
to tear down the pen. She ran up an
American fUg over the pen, and with a
clothes-prop defied any one to tear
down the nation's emblem or trespass
on the property over which it floated.
Undaunted, Beatty stormed tbe fort,
and her weapon was hammered upon
his head, injuring him so badly that he
was confined to bed for ten days. She
was convicted of assaulting Beatty,
with a recommendation to the mercy
of the court.
England's New Policy.?In a
speech at Wakelield, Yorkshire, Eng?
land, last night, Mr. Joseph Chamber,
lain, secretary of state for the colonies,
dispelled any doubt as to Sir Edmund
Monaon's speech in Paris being part of
the settled policy of the British govern?
ment to advertise the French govern?
ment to all the world, and particularly
to the French people, as going too far
mi its hostility to the British policy.
Mr. Chamberlain spoke a long time,
and in conclusion said: "The United
States is already the greatest of tbe
states. If we were assured of the
friendship of the Anglo-Saxon rate,
whether under the Starsaud Stripes or
the Union J.ick, there is no combina
tion i hat could mnke us afraid."

throat troubles. Why wear out your

The Peace Treaty.?As stated yes

peace commissioners concluded their
work that day in Paris, and finally Bel?
lied tbe terms of tbe treaty of peace.
The Spaniards are exceedingly bitter
over the result, though observing the
forms of friendliness and courtesy to
the end.
The Spaniards cbarge equal blame
unon the European powers and the
United States for their downfall. One
of the Spanish commissioners said yes?
terday evening: "The European nations
have made a great mistake in desert?
ing Sf?in and leaving her to spoliation
by the brute force of a conscienceless
ciant. They all know that in the
Philippines America has taken more
than she can digest. She will ultimate?
ly sell tbe islands to England or Ger?
many, and when the transfer is attempt?
ed it will precipitate general European
3trife.
