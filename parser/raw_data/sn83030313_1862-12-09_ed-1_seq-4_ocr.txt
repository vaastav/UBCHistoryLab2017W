The government would seem to cunicinplate the
Introduction of a new financ al policy, if we can
Judge from the resolutions introduced into Con
gress ycxtenlay by Mr. Stevens, of Pennsylvania,
Chairman <>r the Committee ot Wava and Means.
He reported a hill which provides for the issue by
Mr. Chase of a thousand millions of Uniti-d States
bonds, similar iu amount and form to those Aiitbo.
rlrsid by the act approved February 26, 1*62, w ith
interest pay able aenii annually in the lawful money
of the United Slates, and the principal parable in
twenty years in gold or silver coin of the United
Slates; also to issue legal 'ender notes of the
United Slates, the amount not to exceed, with
those aiready authorised,, tive hundred in llions,
to enable Mm to call ?" all the ?ive twenty and

and cancel litem, a/id anthoHTing him to redeem
the United Stales o gal tender note* field as a loan

The bill aims at the virtual suppression of the
banks by the imposition of a tax <?f "Ity per cent
upon all their ciiculalion over one halt the amount
of their capital paid in, to go into operation nine
ty days after the passage of the bill.
Notwithstanding tbe severity of the weather
and the diflrculty of getting uu supplier, owing to
tha ice in Aquiaand Potoiuae creekn. tlie condi

Uir ss proviaious are concerned, is perfectly

A deserter from Murfreesboro reports the rebel

Despatches from St. Imute yesterday state ad.
vices have been received there from the South
west to the effect that the rebels under
Gen rals Hindman and Marmaduke, 26,000 strong,
attempted to force General Want's position at
t'unc Hill, Ark., on Saturday, but were driven
hack. Next morning the rebels drove General
Blunt's pickets three miles; but on the arrival of
re ntoicements (hi rebels were again driven back,
flic opinion of General Blunt is that the deincu
sir.ition of tho rebels was made to cover their re
ieat, as they were telling timber all night, proba
bly to obstruct the toad and prevent pursuit,
mineral Blunt's forces have held the rebels in
check tor lour days.
CONGRESS.
In the Senate yesterday, the Baukmpt Mil was
taken up and made the special order for Thura
day, the lrtli inst. The House bill requiring pay
ment in gold and silver for satisfaction of judg
nn uts in certain suits brought by the United
States was passed. The Military Committee were

viding by Isw for the more effectual suppression
of the rebellion and securing tranquillity in Mary
land. A resolution to extend the call for all
pipers relating to the operutioas of the A nay of
the Potomac, so as to embrace all operations
since the first movement of that army, was adopted.

by Mr. Latham, and referred. Resolutions calling
on the Secretary of War for the number of Major
sad Brigadier Generals in the service, and where
.iiitl how they are employed, also the number and
ranks of aids-de-camp, were adopted. Mr. Sauls,
bury called up the resolution relating to arrests
.n Delaware, but objection was made to its con
? dcrutiou, and after some conversation Hie sub.
ject was dropped. Mr. Davis introduced a joint,
resolution proposing amendments to the constitu

President and Vice President. Mr. Davis'plan is

bearing legal tender notes, and an issue of
11,000,000,000 bonds and $500,000,000 legal tender
notes. It also assesses a heavy tax on bank
circulation. The Bankrupt bill was made the
special order for the lnth Inst. The Standing
Couiniitt.es were announced. The changes troui
last-year are unimportant. The President was re
quested, if not incompatible with the public
interests, to transmit to the Hou*e the last official
report of General Buell. Mr. Stevens introduced
a bill to indemnify the President und other per
sons for suspending the privilege of the writ of

Progt'frf* or the War?Richmond the
Hi art of the Rebellion.
From several late reports from the Southern
coaft it yottld appear, after all, thai neither
Norfolk, nor Suffolk, nor the James river if
the destination of the Banks expedition: that
some of.hi* ships have passed by Fortress
Monroe with their heads still to the southward,
and that the rebels of .South Carolina, from the
departure of a federal fleet from Port lioyal,
conjecture that Wilmington, N. C.. is in danger.
But whatever may be his real point of destina
tion, we confess that the absence of any intelli
gence of the arrival of any of his ships in
Hampton Bcuula causes us some degree of dis
appointment. * ?
From this Banks expedition, united to the
forces io the neighborhood of Fortress Monroe
under General Dix, and with an assisting fleet
of gunboats, we had anticipated a powerful
movement up the James river for Richmond,
in co-operation with the advance of General
Raruslde's army from the North. It may be
that such a movement is still designed in sup
port of General Burnside; but the reports
aforesaid concerning the Banks expedition lead
to the conclusion that if any such side advance
is to he made it will only be a diversion, and
not the positive, active and formidable enter
prise we had expected. Accordingly, under this
modified condition of the Virginia campaign,
our late confident anticipations of the speedy
expulsion of Jeff. Davis from Kichmond. cea?e
to be applicable. We must now depend upon ;
the developments of the next two or three
weeks und upon the weather, and upon tbe
chances of active and efficient ns?istance to
General Bitrnside from tbe War Office audits i
several hureaus. That he has b"en unneces
sarily delayed by dilatory or blundering offi. i
rial m the matter of supplies, pontoon trains
and transportation, we have no doubt. It is .
only ttv old but undeniable story of the I'enin
Hfut and Maryland campaigns over agaiu.
I' flnd? r ,-itch a state of thing* wc cannot promise I
j that General Bitrnside will advance beyond the
' Rappahannock within" a week, a fortnight, or a
( mouth. The disentangling of the rod tape of
| the War Office may, perhaps,oou?uiuo the whole
winter. We can only judge from passing
i events and past experience.
i "In round numbers we havo a million of men
in the field, distributed around the entire circle
of the rebellion, and scattered about at so many
point* nuppoeed to be essential to hold or to
capture, that Burnslde's urtny (nnder estimates
by tbe rebels at one hundred and ten thousund
men),Metns to be the whole active force that
can be spared for Richmond. Meantime the
Bank* expedition, sailing by the James
! ri*?C? reminds us of the Brent Dupont
i expedition |# Port Royai f?>m Fortm?
?? ? - ? ? from that
Monroe, when right across the whtbv ^
rendezvous was Norfolk, Which Dupont>?--^ ?
and Sherman's land forties could have taken in
j two hours f or, with th$ reWt?my Virgin]* j
i encamped at \ianas*as these land aud naval
forces from Hampton Roads oould have moved
rigjit on up the river to Richmond, for the city
was then without fortifications on its laud or
water approaches. Are we to have the same
thing over again, as the frittering away of our
vast resources uphft -grand and costly expe U
tions to the remote extremities of the ->outh,
resulting in no compensating advantages? or
are we really to have this winter an overwhelm
ing blow aimed at Richmond ?
General McCiellan, in his letter to General
Hal leek from Harrison's Landing, pleading
against the recall of his army from that com"
manding position, and begging for reinforce
ments which might have been furnished to enable
him to mov* forward at once, in conjunction
with the gunboats of Commodore Wilkes, upon
Richmond?General McCiellan, in that earnest
and prophetic letter* very truly say?"Here,
directly in front of this army is the heart of the
rebellion. It is here that all our resources
should be collected to strike Abe blow
which will determine tho- fate -of this na
tion. All points of secondary Importance
elsewhere should be abandoned, aud every
available man brought here. A decided victo
ry here, and the military strength of the rebel"
liou Is crushed." This has been our plea since
the establishment of the rebel government at
Richmond. If its* defensive army amounts to
one hundred and fifty thousand men, we would
fbllow it up from the front with an army of two
hundred thousand, and with a supporting flank
movement by a hundred thousand more, in
order to make quick and certain work; and to
do this we would, if neoessary, "abandon all
pomts of secondary importance elsewhere,"
because the vital centre carries with it the
extremities.
We have the fullest confidence in General
Burnside and his splendid army; we are sure
that President Lincoln is thoroughly devoted
to that army, its leader, and the great end in
view; but we are not so sure that this end will
be accomplished under the present incompetent
management of the different branches of the
War Office, or while the capture of Richmond
is made to depeud upon great experimental
diversions to distant places of Little or nu im
portance. We call upon the President to aban
don "all secondary points elsewhere," and to
move in overwhelming strength upon Rich
mond, "the heart of the rebellion."
Attack on Mi. Seward ky the World?
That Joornal Oulng Over to the Radi
cals.
in commenting on the diplomatic correspon
dence oetween Mr. Seward and Mr. Adams, our
Minister at the British Court, the World news,
paper takes occasion to assail the Secretary of
State, and thus to make common cause with
the radicals in and out of the Cabinet, who
never cease to abuse him for bis conservative i
views. Mr. Seward is the only man connected
with the administration who has been successful
in his own department. Hence the enmity and
jealousy of his radical colleagues, into whose
hands the World is playing.
The World is a curious journal and has a
strange history. It was started under the
auspices of Puritanical piety. Like Joseph Sur
face. it was a model of Christian sentiment;
but it soon fell into sin, and the olergy and
other devout supporters of the Godly sheet lost
their money. It became, indeed, an egregious
sinner, the corrupt instrument of the War De
partment, the aider and abettor of all the fat
jobs of Cameron and Cummings. It next
turned up under a different reijime. Last sum
mer it became the organ of Mozart Hall, and
has since been controlled by thai distinguished
politician, Fernando Wood. It is now sold out
to Barlow and Belmont, two money brokers of
Wall street, and is joining hands with the
organs of the radicals in fheir attacks on Mr.
Seward.
His diplomatic correspondence is the pre
text. It is true there are some apparent dis
crepancies in a correspondence so voluminous
and running over a year of varying fortunes.
Hut every letter of Mr. Seward shows that he
had but one aim. one object, and that was to pre.
vent foreign intervention in our affuirs. And
he has been eminehtly successful. There can
be no doubt but that for the ability he has dis
played in managing our relations with the Pow
ers of Europe we would have had long since a
foreign, in addition to a domestic, war upon
our hands. Not only would the Southern con
federacy have been recognized, but the recog.
nit ion would have been maintained by armed
intervention. Mr.Sewurd convinced those Pow
ers that it would not be for their interests to
meddle in our "quarrel, and if the War and
Navy Departments had only done their duty as
well as Mr. How ard they would now have no
excuse to interfere. If the heads of these de
partments, including the General-in-Chief, will
do their duty to the country even now, the
armies of the rebellion will be crushed in the
field within the next two months. But of this
we cannot be very confident after the lessons
of disappointment we have already learned. It
appears from one of the letters of Mr. Adams
that the English talk of doing something start
ling in February. By that time tbey will have
seen how the proclamation of the President
works, and Parliament will have met. But
they had better let us alone. They will have
enough to do to mind their own business. We
can take care of ours.
As for the emancipation proclamation, about
which so much fhss Is made, and as to which
there is a variance of opinion in Mr. Sewafd's
correspondence written lost February and that
which he has recently despatched to Mr. Adams,
it was believed in the beginning of the year
that the rebellion could be speedily put. down,
and the war concluded without resorting to
such a doubtful measure. But the failures of
campaigns?caused by the thwarting and baffling
of Mia Union generals by Ihe intrigues of the
radicals?afforded the latter the opportunity
they desired of bringing a violent pressure to
bear upon the President, so as to induce him to
issue the coveted proclamation. Now the only
value of it, as far as foreign governments are con
cerned, is to take out of the mouths of the cant
ing hypocrites of Exeter Hall the imputation
that the President is not true to liberty. It hae
not diminished the secret hostility of the British
aristocracy to the United .States, but it has mo
derated its expression in the case of some
while on the part of others it is made a text for
new and fiercer onslaughts. Its use in the
United States is not what it may do after the
1st of January in tba Booth, but what it may
effeat jo the Interim at the North. It waa In
tended u a aop to bush the barking of the abo
lition Cerberus, and in th it bas only been
partially successful. Tb$ president, however,

may be emancipated in consequonco of it here*
and there, but the institution will remain intact
Nenber the President nor Congress have auy
i.'gal or constitutional power to abolish
slavery in the Southern States. It is a purely
State matter, over which federal jurisdiction
docs not exist. If the rebels are not conquered
then the proclamation can have no effect. If
they are conquered and the Union restored,
the proclamation is null and void. Mr. Lin
coln has well said that slave properly is as
truly property under the constitution as any
other property. But the constitution defines
treason and prescribes the mode of punishing
it. No citizen can be pronounced a traitor til
he is tried and convicted in a civil court hav
ing lawful jurisdiction in the district where the
offence Is committed. Treason against the
United States conssts in taking up arms
against the government and in giving a d and
comfort to the enemy; and the constitution ex
pressly provides that the forfeiture of property
can only be for tbe 1 fetime of the convicted*
and cannot affect liia heirs Whole conimuni
ties cannot be legally made trait* rs by procla_
inntiou nor their properly seized ai d confis
cated; and if Congress p; ssen !i ty 1. v.\? on the
subject they wi uld have no legal efficacy.
Consequent y if slave property should be
taken away from citizens of the United
Siates by generals of the at my, in
virtue of the prociam ition of the Presi
dent, the property niiu.t be restored or
paid for by the United States government,
unless the persons from whom it hud been
taken should be convicted of tieason in a court
of law after a full and fair trial. T hen. in the
ovent of tbe submission of a rebellious State to
the federal authority, the proclamation could
have no effect upon such slaves as had not al
ready been captured. The moment the war
terminates in any State tbe civ- .1 law prevails,
and private property and S'.ate institutions are
protected by the constitution of the United
States from ail interference on the part of the
federal power.
It the present administration do nat accom
plish mucn more in future than in the [ ast the
war will go on at leust for another ) ear, till
tbe new Congress assembles, or perhaps till the
advent of the conservative party to the execu
tive mansion on the 4th of March, 18<>5. Tbe
elections of 1863 will demonstrule slid more
decidedly than those of 1862 that tlie sceptre is
passing from the hands of tbe radicals, never to
be regained. The fall elections of 1864, in
cluding the Presidential contest, will cap the
climax of public opinion. But whether the
armies of the rebels in tbe field are crushed or
not during the present regime, certain it is that
the non-combataut population of the Southern
States will not be reconciled to the radicals;
and there is no chance of the Union as it was
being restored till Sumner and Wilson, Wade and
Stevens, and the other leaders of tbe abolition
faction, are put down by tbe strong arm of con
servative power. Then will the Union men at
the South respond to the action of their
brethren at the North, and put down the seces
sionists. Thus alone can disunion be ex
tinguished, the integrity of the republic re
stored. and North and South, East and West be
forever one and indivisible.
Poor Greeley knd Hta Overture* of
Peace.
Poor Greeley has been making a very great
fuss in the Tribune lately about propositions
for peace, which he has received, or which he
says somebody else has received, from the rebel
leaders at Richmond. Those who know poor
Greeley need not be assured that the Wiiole
story is a very weak invention. The Count
Adonis Gurowski, who is deep in Grei ley "a con
fidence and a great gun of Gre ley's paper,
recorded in his diary some time ago that Gree
ley was ' slowly breaking down," and this
peace proposition hoax is anotLer evidence of
the fact. Its objects are very evident. In tie
first place, Greeloy Wants to show that the
abortive emancipation proclamation baa scared
the traitors; und, in the second place, in* wishes
to injure the conservative leaders by accusifig
them of parleying with the rebels. Neither of
these objects will be achieved, however; for, if
any person has been guilty of receiving and
entertaining overtures of peace from the chief
Confederates, that person is poor old Greeley
himself.
Tbe agent who brought these alleged peace
propositions from Richmond is the illustrious
Chevalier William Chase Barney. This Cheva
lier maf have been named after tbe Secretary
of the Treasury; but he is not the brother of
Collector Barney, of this port. On tbe con
trary, he is Collector Barney's rival, and the
descendant of the gallant Commodore Barney, of
honored memory. The Chevalier first became
notorious from a romantic afTair in the little
State of Delaware, which be threw inte a
big state of excitement. Ue next en
gaged in the express business, figured ex
tensively in California, and then went
to Europe on a special mission connected with
the Atlantic postal service. Returning a year
and a half ago, he met the New York Seventy,
first regiment marching down Broadway, en
route for Washington, and immediately stepped
off the sidewalk and into tbe ranks. With this
regiment he served during tbe throe months'
campaign, and was then appointed an army ,
paymaster, but wus not confirmed by the ben
ate. It was while acting in this capacity that,
be pushed himself to the front of our lines and
allowed himself to be captured by the rebels.
Colonel Daniel Ullman, the great Hindoo, shared
Barney's fate and confinement, biu was released
some two or three days betore tbe pacific 1
Chevalier. At tbe time of this imprisonment at 1
Richmond Barney received the overtures of
peace about which the lYibune makes so much
fuss, and they amount to just this: that on a
certain occasion, Judab (or /udas) P. Benja
min stated, in Barney's presence, that the South
was willing to return to the Union if things
could all be ,?s they used to be. Ber^jamin as
serted this as his individual 6pialon; and by
having "things as they used to be," he evident
ly meant that Jeff. Davis or some other Pontic
ern rebel should be our President, and all the
rebel ringleaders should fill our federal offices
We have but very little doubt that most of tbe
Pouthern traitors would agree to ?u?h a pro
gramme; but no one except Benjamin mention
:"od tbe matter to Barney.
Returning to the North. Barney became
? ambitious of being a great man? a pacific*
tor, a regenerator, a patriot and a free
lodger at 01 e of our hotels. Consequently
he enlarged his story a little and told it to a
friend, who repeated it to another friend, w ho
repeated it to Greeley. At each repetition the
tale grew more wondrous, and when poor

close, Mayor Opdyke sent for Fernaudo Wood
to inform him of the dreadful plot. Tbe Che
valier Bainey had been be oreband with Op
dyke. however, and had already confided tbe
matter to Fernando. It totems that Mr. Wood
was almost as ba tly hoaxed as poor Greeley ;
for he inyster ously referred to the affair in one
of bis speeches, which Greeley published as aa
official corroboration of his news?that is to
say, whut Barney told Mr. Wood was produced,
with a gre it flourish of trumpets, as proving
the truth of what Barney had told the friend
who told poor Greeley. The idea of Barney
corroborating hirnsell is as rich as Mr. Squeers'
doubly ski aimed milk. In ord'-r to complete
tbe re-emblnnce ot this miraculous narrative
to that of the "House wh cb Jack Built,"dir.
Wood had confidentially entrusted the story to
Thuriow Wood at the Astor-House; but Mr.
Weed was too old and wise a bird to be
caught with Mich chaff, and therefore sneered
at the whole affair, aud called upon poor
Greeley, through the Albany Journal, to make
a retraction and dismiss the man who wrote
the bogus telegram from Washington concern
ing these overtures.
There is the whole truth of the mat
ter, and fur all the rest of the particular*
poor Greeley is responsible. The Cheva
lier Barney talked with no one but Bei\jamin
on the subject, and had no nfbre authority ta
receive peace propositions than Benjamin had
to make them. He was no emissary from any
one. carried no letters or credentials from con
servatives at the North, aud brought back ns
letters, documents or credentials to Governor
Seymour, John Van Bureu or any other man.
What Lenjatuiu said we have given above; and
there is nothing in it about the Crittenden com.
promise, the assumption of tbe Southern debt
or dr.viog the French from Mexico. The story
as originally told rests solely upon Barney'*
veracity. Tbe story, as given in the Tribum,
is the joint product of Barney's veracity and
Greeley's imagination. The mogal of the mat
ter is chat poor Greeley was badly bitten and
drawn into u premature declaration that he i*
iu favor of a national convention to arrange a
peace. We thoroughly believe that.-if this war
lasts one year longer, the conservatives will b*
as true to the Union as ever, while Greeley and
the other radicals will be sending emissaries to
Richmond to offer Jeff. Davis a disruption ot
the Union if he will take all the slave State*
There is tbe real plot which lies under all thh
smoke, had which the radical assistants of th*
rebels are now working hard to accomplish.
Danger Ahcait^Louli XapeleoM'i Pellejf
Toward* This Country*
An effort .8 being made by those journals in
the service of the Emperor Napoleon to palliate
his attempt at drawin? England and Russia into
a coalition against ibis government. The very
fact that excuses are made and that protesta
tions of friendabin and good will are eo ear
nestly repented by the French semi-official
press, the London journals iff the pay of Napo.
icon, and roinev journals here which seem to
take a strange view of Napoleon's movements,
all tend to make ns very suspicious as to Napo
loon's real intentions towards this country. Wo
remember quite well that at the time he was
doing stll in his power to secure Nice and
Savoy the t-emi-ofiicia! French press were cm.
phatically denying that France would, even if
they were proffered, accept the piovinces in
question. We are aw ire that Napoloon says
one 'liing when he means another; that when
he makes a show of good feeling, anger and ill
will rat kle la his heart, and that he fawns
upon those whom he has decided to destroy.
Knowing these things, we are-apprehensive of
evil wheu we iind 'Napoleon making urgent
protestations of good will towards us, and wa
look about tp see where he !??? to strike a first
blow. ? *
France has made more noise about General
Butler's proceedings at Ncrfr Orleans against
her subjects than any other Power has dono,
although General Fatter treated one and all
alike. The fat*, is, Napoleon saw there a flue
chance for a future quarrel. We are a sensi
tive people, don't Jike interference, and. above
all. detest foreign meddling with our tred and
faithful public servants. Ail Napoleon had to
do was to set peremptorily about General But
ler. ask his removal or something alike unplea -
sant to our sense of dignity as a nation, and ho
was sure to get a refusal. Then he could let
the matter remain in abeyance, and at his own
time and pleasure renew his demand, and upon
a second refusal act in o hootUe manner to
wards as.
We do not believe that all lh<- troops and
iron clads which France is now despatching to
the Gulf of Mexioo ore Intended to find
their way to the t imed halls of the
Montezumas. We fear they are more likely to
visit the mud banks of the Mississippi. While
giving assurances of friendship and good will
towards this country. Napoleon is making tr?
mendous preparations for an onset somewhere
Will it be agaiust us or against England? Thoio
Is a doubt in tbis matter, and while that doubt
exists it becomes an imperative duty far ut to
prepare a powerful defence of Mobile and the
mouths of the Mississippi. New Orleans we must
guard as the apple of our eye. The valley ??f
the Mississippi we must hold and control ut all
hazards. Our administration mast Dot halt or
falter here, the dim per may fall upon US it any
moment, and we must be prepared to ward off
the blow. Napoleon is fiata.lt> urjed into iiio
