PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE.
Washington, I)t. .The senate
was called to order at H)in by 1 rcsi
dnt pro. tein. Daviv. After prayer
the custo nary resoluuo is w ere adopt'
. e 1, and a committee waa appointed to
notily the president and the house that
the senate was ready lor business.
Harris, of Tennessee, presented the
memorial of the loard of health of
Memphis approving the action of the
National Itoard of health in askingap
propriatioiis to sustain the same. Re-
lerred.
A bill was introduced by 1 1 ill, of
Colorado, providing for the issue of
coin by the Denver mint.
VoorhwH introduced a bill granting
a nension of 8'iOper month to the widow
of Rear Admiral Scott.
The senate then went to the calen
dar, and, alter disiosing of one or two
private bills, recessed for half an hour.
The senate reconvened at 3:15, and
shortly afterwards the president's
message was read as follows :
To the Sonata ami House of Representatives
of the United Slate:
It is provided by the constitution
that the president shall from time to
time give to congress information of
the state of the Union, and recommend
to their consideration such measures
as he shall judge necessary and expe
dient. In reviewing the events of the
year that has elapsed since the com
mencement of your session, I tirst call
your attention to the gratifying condi
tion of our foreign affairs. Our inter
course with other powers has contin
ued to lof the most friendly character.
Such slight differences as have arisen
during the year have lecn already
settled or are like to reach an early
adjustment. The arrest of citizens of
the United (States in Ireland under re
cent laws which owe their origin to
the disturbed condition of that
country has hd to a somewhat ex
tended corresiondenee with the gov
ernment of Great liritain, and its
position to respect our right has been
practically manifested by the release
of the arrested parties.
FOREIGN RELATIONS.
The claim of this nation in regard to
the supervision and control of the in
ter oceanic canal across the American
isthmus has continued to be the sub
ject of conference. It is likely that
tinmwill be more powerful than dis
cussion in removing the divergence
between the two nations, whose friend
ship is so closely cemented by the in
timacy of their relations and the com
munity of their interests.
Our long established friendliness
with Russia has remained unshaken.
It has prompted me to proffer the earn
est counsel of this government that
measures be adopted for suppressing
the persecution which the Hebrew
race in the country has lately suffered.
It has not transpired that any Ameri
can citizen has been subjected
to arrest or injury, but our courteous
remonstrance has nevertheless been
courteously received. There is rea
son to believe that the time is not far
distant when Russia will be able to
secure toleration to all faiths within
her borders.
At an international congress, held in
Paris in 1880, and attended by repre
sentatives of -the United States, an
agreement was reached in respect to
the position of trade marks, patented
Articles and the rights of manufactur
ing firms and corporations. The
formulating into treaties the recom
mendations thus adopted is receiving
the attention which it merits. The
protection of submarine cables is a
subject now under consideration by
.an international congress at Paris.
Relieving that it is clearly the true
policy of the govenment to fa'vor the
neutralization of this means of inter
course, 1 requested our minister to at
tend the convention as a delegate ;
also designated two of our eminent
scientists to attend as our representa
tives at the meeting of the interna
tional committee ut Paris for consid
ering the adoption of a common unit
to measure electric force.
In view of the frequent occurrence
of conferences for the consideration of
important matters of common
interest to civilized nations,
respectfully suggest that
the executive be invested by congress
with discretionary power to send dele
gate to such a convention, and that
provision be wade to defray the ex
penses incident thereto.
The difference between the United
Mates and Spain, as to the effect of a
judgment and certificate of naturali
zation, has not been adjusted, but it is
hoped and believed that negotiations
now in progress will result in the
establishment of the position which
seems to this government so reasonable
And just.
1 have already called the attention
of congress to the fact that in parts of
Spain and its colonies onerous fines
have lately been imposed upon vessels
of the United States for a trivial tech
nical offense against local regulations.
Efforts for the abatement of these
exactions have thus far proved unsuc
cessful. I regret to inform you also that the
Zees demanded by Spanish consuls at
American ports are in some cases so
large, when compared with the value
of the cargo, as to amount in effect to
a considerable export duty, and that
our remonstrances in this regard have
not as yet received the attention which
they seem to deserve.
The German government has in
vited the United States to participate
in an international exhibition of do
mestic cattle, to be held at Hamburg in
July, 1883. If this country is to be
represented it is important that in the
early days of the session congress
should make suitable appropriation for
that purpose,
The death of Mr. Marsh, our late
xninister to Italy, has evoked from that
.government expressions of profound
' respect for his exalted character, and
for his honorable career in the diplo
matic service of his country. The
Italian government has raised a ques
tion as to the propriety of recognizing
la his dual capacity the representative
of this country recently accredited
both as secretary of legation and as
consul-general at Rome. He has been
received as secretary, but his ex
equaler as consul-general has thus far
been withheld.
The extradition convention with
Belgium which has been in
operation since 1874 has been
lately supplanted by another.
The senate has signified its approval
nd ratifications have been duly ex
changed between the contracting coun
tries. To the list of extraditable
crimes has been added that of the as
sassination or attempted assassination
of the chief of the state.
Negotiations have been opened with
Switzerland, looking to a settlement
by treaty of the question whether its
citizens can reverence their allegiance
and become citizens of the Lnited
States without obtaining the consent
of this government. 1 am glad to in
form you that the immigration of
paupers and criminals from certain of
the counties of Switzerland has sub
stantially ceased and is no longer sanc
tioned by the authorities. The con
sideration of this subject has prompted
the suggestion that the act of August
8, 1882, which has for its object the
return of foreign convicts to their
own country, should be so modified as
not to be open to the interpretation on
preferred charges of crime.
The ottoman porte has not yet ar
rived to the interpretation which the
government has put on the treaty of
1830, relative) to the jurisdiction and
rights in Turkey. It may be well, how
ever, that this difference be adjusted
by a general revision of the svstem of
jurisdiction of the United States in the
countries of the eat, subject to
which your attention has already been
called by the secretary of stat e.
In the interest of justice towards 1
China and Japan, I trust that the
?uestionof return of the ind.-nirutv
und to the governments of tlW.
countries will reach at the present
session the satisfactory solution which
have already been recommended, and
which has recently been foreshadowed
by congressional oiscussion.
The treaty lately concluded with
Corea awaits the action of the senate.
During the late disturbance in Egypt
the timely presence of American ves
bjIs served as a protection to persons
and proierty of many of our citizens
and of citizens of other countries,
whose governments have expressed
their thanks for this assistance.
THE CHINESE.
The recent legislation restraining
the immigration of laborers from
China has given rise to the ques
tion whether the Chinese pro
ceeding to or from their
country may lawfully pass through
our own construction of the act of
May 6, 1882. In connection with the
treaty of November 7, 1880, the re
striction would seem to be limited to
Chinese immigrants coming to the
country as laborers, and would not
forbid a mere transit across our terri
tory. I ask the attention of congress
to the subject for such action, if any,
us may be deemed advisable.
This government has recently had
occasion to manifest its interest in the
republic of Liberia by seeking to aid
thejumicuhle settlements of boundary
dispute now pending between that re
public and the British possession of
Sierra Leon.
The reciprocity treaty with Hawaii
will lecome terminable after Septem
ber 9, 1883, or twenty months' notice
bv either party. While certain pro
visions of that compact have been
proven onerous, its existence has fos
tered commercial relations, which it is
important to preserve. I suggest,
therefore, that early consideration be
given to such modifications of the
treaty as seem to be demanded by the
interests of our people.
In view of our increasing trade with
Hayti and San Domingo, I advise that
provision be made for diplomatic in
tercourse with the latter by enlarging
the scope of mission at Port-au-Prince.
I regret that the claims of the
American citizens against the gov
ernment of Hayti have thus far been
urged unavailihgly.
A recent agreement with Mexico
provides for the crossing the frontier
by the armed forces of either country
in pursuit of hostile Indians. In my
message of last year I called attention
to the prevalent lawlessness upon the
boarders, and to the necessity of leg
islation for its suppression. I again,
invite the attention of congress to the
subject. A partial relief from these
nuschets has been sougnt in a
convention which now awaits
the approval of the sen
ate, as does another also
touching the establishment of the in
ternational boundary line between the
United States and Mexico. If the lat
ter is retarded the action of congress
will be reouired for establishing suit
able commissioners of survey. The
boundary dispute between Mexico
and Guatemala, which led this gov
ernment to proffer its friendly coun
sel to both parties, naa Deen arnica div
settled. No change has occurred with
our relations with Venezuela. I again
invoke your action in the matter of
the finding awards against that re
public, to which special reference was
matte bv a special message from
the executive at your last session. An
invitation was received from the gov
ernment of v enezuela to send repre
sentative in July, 1883, to Caracas to
participate in the centennial celebra
tion ot the birth of Bolivar, the found
er of South American independence,
In connection with this event it is de
signed to commemorate the erection,
at Caracas, of a statue of Washington,
i i a. i i i i 1.21
ana conuuet. an uiuustriai exuiumou
which will be open to American pro
ductions. I recommend that the
United States be represented and that
suitable provision be made there
for. The elevation of the grade
of your mission m Central
Vmerica to the plenipotentiary
rank which was authorized by con
gress by its late session has been since
effected. The war between Peru and
Bolivia on the one side and Chili on
the other began more than three years
ito, oil LUC wuupatiuu uy v. 11 111 m
1880 of all the literal territory of Bol
ivia. Negotiations for peace were
conducted under the direction of the
United States. The allies refused to
concede any territory, but Chili has
since become master ot tne wnoie
coast of I Kith countries and of the cap
ital of l'eru a year since, as you
have already been advised by
correspondence transmitted to you
in January last, inis government
sent a special mission to the belliger
erent powers to express the hope that
Chili would be disposed to accept a
money indemnity for expenses of war
and to relinquish her demands for a
portion or the territory ot her anta
gonist.
This is are commendation wnicn until
declined to follow. This government
did not assume, to force nor can it be
forced without resort to measures
which would be in keeping with
neither the temper of our people nor
with the spirit ot our in
stitutions. The power of Peru
no longer exists over the whole terri
tory, and in the event of our inter
ference to dictate peace would need to
be supplemented by the army and
navy ot the United States. Such in
terference would almost inevitably
tend to the establishment, of a protec
toratea result utterly at odds with
our past policy, injurious, to our present-
interests and full of embarrass
ments for the future for effecting the
termination of hostilities upon terms
at once just to the victorious nation
and generous to its adversaries. This
government has spared no efforts to
avoid such complications as I have in
dicated. It i3 greatly to be deplored
that Chili seems resolved to exact
such rigorous conditions of peace and
indisposed to submit to arbitration the
terms of an amicable settlement. No
pea-e is likelv to be lasting that is not
sufficiently equitable and just to com
mand the approval or other nations.
About a year since invitations were
extended to the nations of this conti
nent to fend representatives toa peace
congress to assemble at Washington
in November, 1882. The time or
meeting was fixed at a period then re
mote in the hope as the invitation it
self declared that in the meantime
disturbances between the South
American republics would be adjusted.
As that expectation seemed to be realiz
ed I asked in April last for an ex
pression oi opinion from the nouses
of congress as to the advisibility of
holding the proposed convention at the
time appointed. This act was prompt
ed in part by doubt which mature re
flection had suggested whether diplo
matic usages and traditions of the
government did not make it fitting
that the executive should consult the
representatives of the people before
pursuing a line of action, somewhat
novel in its character and far reaching
in its possible consequences. In view of
the fact that no action was taken by
congress in the premises, and that no
provision had been made fornecessary
expenses, I subsequently decided to
postpone the convention and so notified
the several governments, which had
been invited to attend. I am unwill
ing to dismiss this subject without
assuring you of my support
of any measure the wisdom of con
gress may devise for the promotion of
peace of the continent and throughout
the world, and I trust that the time is
very nigh when, with the universal
assent of the people, all international
differences shall be determined with
out a resort to arms, by the benignant
processes of arbitration.
Changes have occurred in the diplo
matic representation of several for
eign powers during the past year. New
ministers from the Argentine repub
lic, Austria, Hungary, Brazil, China,
Chili, France, Japan, Mexico, the
Netherlands and Russia have pre
sented their credentials. The mis
sions of Denmark, and Venezuela at
this capital have, been raised in grade,
Switzerland has created a plenipoten
tiary mission to this government, and
ambassy from Mad;u?ascar and minis
ter from Siam will shortly arrive.
Our diplomatic intercourse has been
enlrged by the establishment of re
lations with the new kingdom of Ser
via, by the creation of a mission to
Siam, and by the creation of a mission
to Greece. The shah of Persia has ex
pressed his gratification that a charge
i an airs will shortly be sent to that
country, where the rights of our citi
zen have been hitherto courteously
(ni u.Ki by representatives of Great
1 kr.ow my rwommendation of such I
legislation as will place the' United
states in harmony with other mari
time powers with respect to interna
tional rules for the prevention of col
lisions at sea, in conformity with
your joint resolution of the 3d of Au
gust last, I have directed the secretary
of state to address the foreign gov
ernments in response to a proposed
conference for considering the subject
of the universal adoption of a common
prime meridian, to be used in reckon
ing of longitude throughout the civil
ized world. Their replies will in due
time be laid before you.
An agreement was reached in Paris
in 1875, between the powers, for an
interchange of official publications
through the medium of their
respective foreign departments. The
admirable system which has been
built up bv the enterprise oi tne Smith
sonian institute anoros a practical
basis for our co-operation in this
scheme. Arrangement has been
pffected bv which that institution
will perform the necessary labor un
der the department oi state, anu rea
sonable compensation therefor should
be provided by law. A clause in the act

matic and consular service, and con

branches of such service on salaries

will present to you at an early day a
plan for such reorganization.
THE TREASURY.
A full and interesting exhibit of

COMMERCE.
The foreign commerce of the United
States, during the last fiscal year, in
cluding imports and exports of mer
chandise and specie, was as follows :
Exports of merchandise, $750,542,259 ;
specie, $49,417,479 ; total, $799,995,96.
Imports of merchandise, $734,639,574 ;
specie, 42,472,390 ; total, $767,111,964.
Excess of exports over imports of
merchandise, $259,092,683. This ex
cess is less than it has been before for
any of the previous six years, as ap
pears by the following table for the
year ended June 30 : Excess of ex
ports over imports of merchandise for
1876, $79,643,481 ; 1877, $141,152,094 ;
1878, $257,814,234 ; 1879, $26,466,166;
1880, $16,758,3912; 1881, $259,712,718;
1882, $25,902,683. During the year
there have been organized 171 national
banks, and of those institutions there
are now in operation 2269, a larger
number than ever before. The value
of notes in active circulation July 1,
1882, $324,656,458, I commend to your
attention the secretary's views in re
spect to the likelihood of a serious con
traction of this circulation and the
modes by which that result may, in
his judgment, be averted. In respect
to the coinage of silver dollars and the
retirement of silver certificates,! have
seen nothing to alter but much to con
firm the sentiments to which I
gave expression last year. A compari
son between the respective amounts
of silver dollars imcirculation or Nov.
1, 1881, and on Nov. 1, 1882, shows a
slight increase of a million and a half
dollars; but during the interval there
had been in the whole number of coin
ed an increase of $26,000000. Of the $128,
000,000 thus far minted little more than
$35,000,000 are in circulation. The mass
of accumulated coin has grown so
great that the vault room at present
available for storage is scarcely suffi
cient to contain it. It is not apparent
why it is desirable to continue the
coinage now so enormously in excess
of public demand. As to the silver cer
tificates, in addition to the grounds
which seemed last year to justify their
retirement may be mentioned the
effect which is likely to ensue from
the supply of gold certificates for
whose issuance congress recently
made a provision and which are now
in active circulation. You can't fail
to note with interest the discussion by
the secretary as to the necessity of
providing by legislation some method
of freeing the treasury of an excess of
assets.
REDUCTION OF TATATION.
In the event that congress fails
to reach an early agreement
for the reduction of taxation, I hearti
ly approve the secretary's recom
mendation of immediate and exten
sive reductions in the annual revenues
of the government. It will be re
membered that I urged upon the at
tention of congress at its last session
the impor tance of relieving the in
dustry of the country from the pres
sure of unnecessary taxation." it is
one of the truest maxims of political
economy that all taxes are burden
some, however wisely and prudently
imposed, and though there have al
was been among our people wide dif
ferences of sentiment as to the best
methods of raising the na
tional revenues, indeed as
to the principles upon which
taxation should be based, there has
been a substantial record that only
such taxes ought to be levied as are
necessary for a wise and economical
administration of the government. Of
late the public revenues have far ex
ceeded that limit, and unless checked
by appropriate legislation, such excess
will continue to increase from year to
rear. For the fiscal year ending June
30,1881, the surplus revenue amounted
to $100,000,000; for the fiscal year
ending the 30th of June last the sur
plus was more than $145,000,000. The
report of the secretary shows, what
disposition has been made of these
moneys. They have not only!
answered the requirements of
sinking fund, but have offered the
large balance applicable to other re
ductions of the public debt; but I re
new the expression of my conviction
that such rapid extinguishment of the
national debt as now taking place is
by no means cause for congratulation;
it is cause rather for serious appre
hensions if it continues. It must be
speedily followed by one of the evil
results so clearly set forth in the re
port of the secretary. The surplus
must be idle in the treasury or the
government will be forced to buy at
market rates its bonds not then re- j
deemable, and which, under such cir
cumstances, cannot tail to command
an enormous prcmiumor the swollen
revenues'will be- devoted to extrava
gant expenditure, which our experi
ence hasjtaught lead from an overflow
ing treasury. It was made apparent
in the course of animated discussions
which this question aroused at the
last session or congress, that policy
of diminishing the revenue by re
ducing taxation commanded the gen
eral approval of the members of both
houses. I regret that because of con
flicting views as to the best methods
by which that poncy should be made
operative none of its benefits have as
yet been reaped. In the fulfillment of
what I deem my constitutional duty,
but with little hope that I can make
valuable contribution to this vital
question, I shall proceed to intimate
briefly my own views in
relation to it. Upon the
showing of our financial condition at
the close of last year, I felt justified
in recommending to congress the
abolition of all internal revenue
tax except that on tobacco in its va
rious forms, and upon distilled spirits
and fermented liquors, and except also
a special tax upon manufacturers and
dealers in such articles. I venture
now to suggest that, unless it shall be
ascertained that the probable expendi
tures of the government for the com
ing year have been underestimated, all
internal taxes save those which relate
to distilled spirits, can be prudently
abolished. Such a course, if accom
panied by a simplification of machinery
of collection which would then be of
easy accomplishment, might be reason
ably expected to reduce the cost of
such collection by at least two and a
half millions of dollars, and in the re
tirement from office of from fifteen
hundred to two thousand persons. The
system of excise duties hiis never com
mended itself to the favor of the
American people, and has never been
resorted to except for supplying dert
ciences in the treasury, when by rea
son of special exigencies duties on
imports have proved inadequate for
the needs of government. The senti
ment of the country doubtless de
mands that the present excise tax
shall be alwlisned,. as soon as
such a course can be safely
pursued. It seems to me, how
ever, that for various reasons so
sweeping, a measure as the total alo
lition of internal taxes would for the
present be an unwise step. Two of
these reasons are deserving of special
mention. First, it is by no means
clear that even if the existing system
of duties on imports is continued
without modification, those duties
alone will yield sufficient revenue for
all the needs of the government.
It is estimated that $100,000,000 will
be required for pensions during
the coming year, and it may
be well doubted whether
the minimum annual demand for that
object has been reached. The uncer
tainty upon this question would alone
justifyi in my judgment, the reten
tion, for the present, of that portion
of the svstem of internal revenue
system which is least objectionable to
the people. Second, the total aboli
tion of tne excise taxes would almost
inevitably prove a serious, if not an
insurmountable obstacle to a thor
ough revision of the tariff and to any
considerable reduction in import
duties.
THE TARRIFF.
The present tariff system is in many
respects unjust. It makes unequal
distributions both of its burdens and
its benefits. This fact was.practically
recognized by a majority of each
house of congress in the passage of
the act creating the tann commission
The report of that commission will be
placed before you at the beginning of
this session, and will, I trust, afford
you such information as to the condi
tion and prospects of the various com
mercial, agricultural, manufacturing,
mining and other interests of the
country, and contain such suggestions
for statutory revision as will practi:
cally aid your action upon this impor
tant subject.
CUSTOMS DUTIES.
The revenue from customs for the
fiscal year ended June 30, 1879,
amounted to $137,000,000. It has in
the three succeeding years reached,
first, $186,000,000, then $198,000,000, and
finally, as has been already stated,
ax,uuu,uuu. The income irom
this source, for the fiscal year
which will end on June 30,
1883, will doubtless be considerably in
excess of the sum last mentioned. If
the tax on domestic spirits is to be re
tained, it is plain that large reductions
from the customs revenue are entirely
feasible. While recommending this
reduction 1 am far from advising the
abandonment of a policy of so dis
criminating in the adjustment of de
tails as to afford protection to domes
tic labor, but the present system
should be so revised as to equalize
public burden among all classes and
occupations, and bring it into har
mony with the present needs of in
dustry. Without entering into minute
detaiC which under the present cir
cumstances is unnecessary, I recom
mend the enlargement of the free list
so as to include within it the numer
ous articles which yield inconsiderable
revenue. A simplication of the com
plex and inconsistent schedule of du
ties upon certain manufactories, par
ticularly those of cotton, iron and
steel, and a substantial reduction of
the duties upon those articles and
upon sugar, molasses, silk, wool and
woolen goods. If a general revision
of the tariff shall be found to be im-
Eracticable at this session I express the
ope that at least some of the more
conspicuous inequalities of the present
law may be corrected before your final
adjournment. One of them is especially
referred to by the secretary. In view
of a recent decision of tlie supreme
court the necessity of amending the
law by which by the duties, standard
of color is adopted as the test of
the saccharine strength of sugars is
too obvious to require comment.
THE INDIANS.
From the report of the secretary of
war it appears that the only outbreaks
of the Indians during the past year
occurred in Arazona and in the" south
western portion of New Mexico; they
were promptly quelled, and the quiet
which has prevailed in all other parts
of the country has permitted such an
addition to be made to the military
force in the region endangered by the
Apaches, that there is little reason to
apprehend trouble in ' the future.
THE SEA COA8T DEFENSES.
Those parts of the secretary's report
which relate to our sea coast defences
and their armament, suggest the grav
est reflections. Our existing fortifica
tions are notoriously inadequate in
defence for the great harbors
and cities for whose protec
tion they were built The
question of providing an amount suit
ed to our present necessities has been
subject of consideration by a board
whose report was transmitted to con
gress at tne last session; pending the
consideration of that report, the war
department has taken no steps for the
manufacture or conversion of any
heavy cannon, but the secretary ex
presses the hope that authority and
means to begin that important work
will be soon provided.
ARMING THE MILITIA.
I invite the attention of congress to
the propriety of making more ade
quate provision for arming and equip
ping the militia than is provided by
the act of 1808, which is still upon the
statute book. The matter has already
been the subject of discussion in the
senate, and a bill which seeks to sup
ply the deficiencies of existing laws is
now upon its calendar.
SEPARATE APPROPRIATIONS.
The secretary of war calls attention
to the fact of embarrrssments
caused by legislative enactments. It
will be scarcely gainsaid even by those
who favor the most liberal expendi
tures for such purpose as are sought
to be accomplished by what is com
monly called the river and harbor bilL
The practice of grafting in such a
hill annrnnrilltinns for 8 STreat diversi
ty of objects widely separated, either
in their nature or m me iuwuivj "u
which they are concerned or in both,
ia nn which is much to be depreciat
ed unless it is immediate. " It inevita
bly tends to secure the success of the
bill as a whole though many of these
items, if separately considered, could
scarcely fail of rejection. By the adop
tion of the course I have recommend
ed every member of congress when
ever opportunities arise sum uu
influence and vote tor merito
rious appropriations would oe enaoiea
so to do without being called upon to
sanction others by his approvals. So
also would the executive be afforded a
fuller opportunity to exercise his con
stitutional prerogative of opposing
whatever appropriation seemed to
him objectionable without imperilling
t.ie sucteos 01 oii.ers which commend
themselves to his judgment. It may
be urged in opposition to these sug
gestions that the number of works of
internal improvement which are just
ly entitled to government aid is so
great as to render impracticable sep-
i i -n . 11 f
orate appropriation uins tnereior, even
for such a comparatively limited num
ber as to make disposition of large
sums of money. This objection may
be well founded in respect to particu
lar objects. It will be entirely possi
ble to provide for those objects by spe
cial legislation. It is possible, for ex
ample, that a delay until the assem
bling of the next congress to make
additional appropriations for the Mis
sissippi river improvements might be
attended by serious consequences.
Should such be the case a just bill re
lating to that subject would command
my approval.
. This leads me to offer a
suggestion which, I trust, will
commend itself to the wisdom
of congress. Is it not advisable that
grants of considerable sums of money
for diverse and independent schemes
of internal improvements should be
made V
If any action seems to arise for giv
ing his vote for merited or meritorious
appropriations, he would be enabled so
to do without being- called upon to
sanction others. His approvals also
would be executive, and he would be
afforded a fuller opportunity to exer
cise his constitutional prerogative of
opposing whatever appropriation seem
ed to him objectionable without im
periling the success of others which
commend themselves to his judgment.
It may be urged in opposition to these
suggestions that the number of works
of internal improvement which are
justly entitled to government aid is so
great as to render impracticable sepa
rate appropriation bills therefor, or
even for such comparatively
limited number as make disposition of
large sums of money. This objection
may be well founded and distinct
legislative enactments, It will be
scarcely gainsaid, even by those who
favor the most liberal expenditures
for such purposes as are sought to be
accomplished by what is commonly
called the river and harbor bill, that
the practice of grouping in such a bill
appropriations for a great diversity of
objects, widely separated either in
their nature or in the locality with
which they are concerned, or in both,
as one which is much to be deprecated,
Unless it is irremediable, it inevitably
tends to secure the success of the bill
as a whole, though many of the items
it seperateiy considered could scarcely
fail of rejection. By the adoption of
the course I have recommended, every
member of congress whenever oppor-
tuity should oner, and wnetner or not
the advantages which would likely
ensue from the adoption of the course
I have recommended, and may perhaps
bemoreenectually attained by another,
which I resnectf ull v submit to congress
as an alternative proposition. It is
provided by the constitutions of four
teen of our states that the executive
may disapprove any item or items of
a bill appropriating money, where
upon the part of the bill approved
shall be law and the partly disap
proved shall fail to become law un
less repassed according to the provi
sions prescribed for the passage of
bills over the veto or the executive.
The states wherein some such pro
visions as the foregoing is part of the
fundamental law are Alabama, Cali
fornia, Colorado, .Honda, Georgia,
Louisiana, Minnesota, Missouri, Ne
braska, New York, New Jersey, Penn
sylvania, Texas and West Virginia.
1 commend to your careful considera
tion the question whether an amend
ment of the federal constitution in
the particular indicated would not
afford the best remedy for what is
often a grave embarrassment to mem
bers of congress and the executive
and is sometimes a serious public
mischief.
, RETIREMENT OF OFFICERS.
On the subject of inconsistency of
the recent act of congress making the
retirement of the officers of the army
compulsory at the age of sixty-four.
The recent act of 1878 is still in force
which limits to 400 the number of
those who can be retired for disability
or upon their own application. The
two acts when construed together
seem to forbid the retiring even for
the absolute incapacity of officers who
do not fall within the purview of the
latter statute, save at such times as
there is a chance to be less than 400
names on the retired list. There are
now 450. It is not likely that congress
intended this result, and I concur with
the secretary that the law ought to be
amended.
NO RIVER BILL.
The grounds that impelled me to
withhold my signature trom the bill
entitled, "An act making appropriation
on certain works on rivers and har
bors," which became a law near the
close of your last session, prompt me
to express the hope that no similar
measure will be deemed necessary dur
ing the present session of congress.
Indeed, such a measure would now be
open to a serious objection in addition
to that which was lately urged upon
your attention. 1 am informed by the
secretary of war that the greater por
tion ot the sum appropriated tor the
various items specified in that act re
mains unexpended. Of the new works
authorized, expenses have been
incurred upon two only for which the
total appropriation are $210,000. The
E resent available advance is disclosed
y thefollowing:Amountof appropria
tion by the act of August 2, 1882, $18,
738,875; amount of appropriation by
act of June 19, 1882, $10,000; amount
of appropriation for payment to J. B.
Eads, $304,000; unexpended by balance
of former appropriation, $4,738,263.
Total $23,791,138; less amount drawn
from the treasury July 1,
tion leaves little doubt that all
the members perished at sea. Asa
slight tribute tb their heroism I give
in this communication the names of
the gallant men who sacrificed their
lives in this expedition: Lieutenant
commander George w. L. DeLong,
Surgeon Joseph iL Ambler, J. C. Col
lins, Hans Holman, Erichson, Hein
rich H. Koach, George AV. Boyd, Wal
ter Lee, Adolph Dressier, Carl A.
Gartz, Nelse Iverson, the cook, A. H.
Sam. and the Indian Alexes. The
officers and men in the missing boat
were Lieut. Charles w. Chipp, com
manding; William Dunbar, Alfred
Sweetman, Walter Showell, Albert C.
Kuhn, Ed. Star, Henry D. Warren
and Peter E. Johnson. Lieut. Giles
B. Barber and Master William II.
Scheutze are now bringing home the
remains of Lieut. DeLong and his
comrades, in pursuance of the direc
tions of congress. The Rogers, fitted
out for the relief of the Jeannette, in
accordance with the act of congress of
1882, and .N ov. au, 1882, e,i&o,i94 ; total.
$17,734,944. It appears by this exhibit
that so far as concerns most of the
items to which the act of August 2,
1882. relates there can be no need of
further appropriations until after the
close of the present session.
THE NAVT.
The report of the secretary of the
navy states the movements of the va
rious squadrons during the year in
home and foreign waters, where our
officers and seamen, with such ships as
we possess, have continued to illus
trate the high character and excellent
discipline of the naval organization.
On the 21st of December, 1881, in
formation was received that the ex
ploring1 steamer Jeannette had been
crushed and abandoned in the Arctic
ocean. The officers and crew, after a
journey over the ice, embarked in
three boats for the coast of Siberia.
One boat in command of Chief Engi
neer Geo. W. Melville reached the
land, and, falling in with the navy,
was saved; tne party unaer rueut.
Commander DeLong landed in a bar
ren region near the mouth of the
Lena river, and before two weeks had
elapsed all but two of the number
died from fatigue and starvation. No
tidings have been received trom tne
party in the third boat under the
command of Lieut. Chipp, but
a long and fruitless investiga
March 3, 1881, sailed from San Francis
ptv .lime 15. under command of Lieu
tenant Robert M. Berry. On November .
30 she was accidentally destroyed by
fire while in winter quarters in St.
Lawrence bay, but the officers and
crew succeeded in escaping to the
shore. Lieutenant Barry and one of
his officers, after making a search for
the Jeannette along the coast of Sibe
ria fell in with Chief Engineer Mel
ville's party and returned home by
way of Europe. The other officers
and the crew of the Roger were
brought from St. Lawrence by the
whaling steamer North Star. Master
J. Putuian, who had been placed in
charge of supplies at Cape Sorge, re
turned to his post from St. Lawrence
bay across the ocean in a blinding
snow storm, and was carried out to
sea notwithstanding all efforts to rec
cue him.
It appears by the secretary's report
that the available naval force of the
United States consists of thirty-seven
cruisers, fourteen single turreted mon
itors, built during the rebel
lion, a large number of
smooth-bore guns and Parrott rifles
and 87 rirted cannon. The cruising ves
sels should be gradually replaced by
iron or steel ships, the monitors by
armored vessels and the armament by
high power rifled guns. The recon
struction of our navy, which was re
commended by me in my last mes
sage, was begun by congress authoriz
ing in its recent act the construction
of two large unarmed steel vessels of
the character recommended bv the
late naval advisory board, and of a
new advisory board to be provided as
by that act. I call your attention to
the recommendation of the secretary
and the board that authority be given
for the building of two or more ves
sels of smaller dimensions and one
fleet dispatch vessel, and that appro
priation be made for high power rifled
cannon for the torpedo boats and for
other harbor defenses. Pending the
consideration by congress of the policy
to be hereafter adopted in conducting
the eight large navy yards and the ex
pensive establishments, the reduction
of expenditures therefor to the lowest
possible amounts for the purpose of
affording the officers and seamen of
the navy opportunities for exercise
and discipline in their profession un
der appropriate control and direction.
The secretary advises that the light
house and coast survey be transferred
as now from the treasury to the navv
department and he also suggests for
the reasons which he assigns that a
similar transfer may wisely be made
of cruising revenue vessels. The
secretary forcibly depicts inti
mate connection and independence
of the navy and the commercial ma
rine, and invites attention to the con
tinued decadence of the latter and the
corresponding transfer of our growing
commerce to foreign countries. This
subject is one of the utmost import
ance to the national welfare and of
the reviving of American ship build
ing, and of restoring the United States
flag in the ocean carrying trade, and
should receive the immediate atten
tion of congress. We have mechan
ical skill and abundant material for
the manufacture of iron steamships
in fair competition with our commer
cial rivals. Our disadvantage in build
ing ships is the greater cost of labor
and in sauing them, higher taxes and
greater interest on capital, while the
ocean highways are already
monopolized by our formidable
competitors. These obstacles should
in some way be overcome and for our
our rapid communications with for
eign lands we should not contmue to
depend wholly on vessels built in the
yards of other countries and sailing
under foreign flags. With no United
sstates steamers on tne principal ocean
lines or in any foreign ports, our facil
ities for extending our commerce are
generally restrained, while the nations
which built and sail ships and carry
mails and passengers obtain these con
spicuous advantages increasing their
trade.
THE MAIL SERVICE.
The report of the postmaster gene
ral gives evidence or the satisfactory
condition of that department and con
tains many valuable data and accom
panying suggestions which can
not fail to be of interest.
The information which it affords that
the receipts for the fiscal year have
exceeded expenditures must be very
gratifying to congress and to the peo
ple ot the country. As matters which
may fairly claim particular attention,
i reier you to nis observations in ret
erence to the advisability of changing
tne present basis tor nxing the salary
and allowances tor tne money order
system, and for enlarging the functions
of the postal establishment so as to
put under its control the telegraph
system of the country, though from
this last and most important recom
mendation I must withhold my con
currence. At tne last session oi con
gress several bills were introduced into
the nouse ot representatives tor the
reduction of letter postage to a rate of
two cents tor one-halt ounce. I have
given much study and reflection to
this subject and am thoroughly per
suaded that such a reduction will be
for the best interests of the public. It
has been the policy of the govern
ment from its foundation to defray as
far as possible the expenses of carry
ing the mails by a direct tax in the
form of postage. It has never been
claimed, however, that its services
ought to be productive of a net reve
nue. As has been stated already the
report of the postmaster general shows
that there is now a very considerable
surplus in the department, and that
henceforth the receipts are likely
to increase at a much greater ratio
than the primary expenditures. Un
less some change is made in the laws
the profits of the postal service will in
a few years swell the revenues of the
government many millions of dollars.
The time seems auspicious, therefore.
for some reduction in the rates of
postage. In what shall that reduction
consist? A review of the legislation
which has been enacted upon this sub
ject during the last thirty years dis
closes the fact that domestic letters
constitute the only class of mail matter
which has never been favored by
substantial reduction of rates.
I am convinced that the burden of
maintaining the service falls most un
equally upon that class, and that more
than any other it is entitled to present
relief, and that such relief may be ex
tended without detriment to other
public interests will be discovered
upon receiving the results of former
reductions. Immediately prior to the
act of 1845 the postage on a letter,
composed of a single sheet, was as fol
lows: If conveyed thirty miles or less
six cent, between thirty and eighty
miles ten cents, between eighty and
150 miles twelve and one-half cents,
between 150 and 400 miles eighteen
and three-quarter cents, over
400 miles twenty-five cents.
By the act of 1845 the postage upon a
single letter conveyed for any distance
under 300 miles was fixed at five cents
and for any greater distance at ten
cents. By the act of 1851 it was pro
vided that a single letter, if prepaid,
should be carried any distance not ex
ceeding 300 miles for three cents, and
any greater distance for six cents. It
will be noticed that both these reduc
tions were of a radical character, and
relatively quite as important of that
which is now proposed. In each case
there ensued a temporary loss
of revenue, but as sudden
a large influx of business,
which substantially repaid that
loss within three years. Unless the ex
perience of the past legislation in this
country and elsewhere eoes for nancht
it may be safely predicted that the
stimulus of fifty per cent reduction in
tax for carriage would at once increase
the number of letters consigned to the
mails. The advantages of the secrecy
would lead to a very general substitu
tion of the sealed packets of the postal
and open circulars and divers other
ways, i he volume or hrst-class mat
ter would be enormously augmented.
Such increase amounted in England in
the first year after the adoption of the
penny postage to more than 126
per cent. As the result
of careful estimates, the de
tails of which can't be here set out.
1 have been convinced that the defi
ciency for the first year after the re
duction would not exceed seven per
cent of the expenditures, or $300,000,
while the deficiency after the reduc
tion of 1845 was more than fourteen
per cent; and after that that of 1851
was twenty-seven per cent. Another
interesting comparison is afforded bv
statistics furnished me by the postoffice
department The act of 1845 was
passed in face of the fact that there
existed a deficiency of 830,000; that of
1851 was encouraged by the slight sur
plus of $13,200. The excess of revenue
in the next fiscal year is likely
to be $350,000. If congress
should approve these suggestions, it
may be deemed desirable to supplv to
some extent the deficiency that must
for a time ensue, by increasing the
charge for carrying merchandise,
which is now but sixteen cents per
pound. But even without such an
increase, I am confident that the re
ceipts under the diminished rate would
equal the expenditures after the lapse
or three or four years.
THE JUDICIARY.
The report of the department of jus
tice brings a view to your notice of
enlarging the present system of fedend
jurisprudence so as effectually to an
swer the requirements of the ever
increasing litigation with which it is
called upon to deal.
The attorney general renews the
suggestions of his predecessor, that in
the interests of justice better pro
vision than the existing laws afford
should be made in certain judicial dis
tricts for fixing the fees of witnesses
and jurors. In my message of De
cember last 1 referred to pending
criminal proceedings growing out of
alleged frauds in what is known as
the star route service of the jostoffice
department, and advised you that I
had enjoined upon the attorney gen
eral and associates, to whom the inter
ests of the government were en
trusted, the duty of prosecut
ing with the utmost rigor of
the law all persons who might
be found chargeable with these
offences. The trial of one of these
cases has since occurred. It occupied
for many weeks the attention of the
supreme court of this district, and was
conducted with great zeal and
ability. It resulted in a disagreement
of the jury, but the case has been
again placed upon the calendar and
will shortly be retried. If any guilty
person shall finally escape punishment
for their offences it will not be for lack
of deligent and earnest efforts on the
part ot the prosecution.
A BANKRUPT LAW.
I trust that some agreement may be
reached which will speedily enable con
gress, with the concurrence of the ex
ecutive, to award the commercial com
munity the benefit of a national bank
rupt law.
INDIAN AFFAIR8.
The report of the secretary of the
interior with its accompanying docu
ments presents a full statement of the
operations of that department in re
spect to Indian affairs. Nothing
has occurred which has changed or
seriously modified the views to which
I devoted much of my space in a
former communication to congress. I
renew the recommendations therein
contained as to extending to the In
dian the protection of the law,allotting
land in several districts and making
suitable provision for the education of
youths. Such provision, as the secre
tary forcibly maintains, will prove un
availing unless it is broad enough to
include all those who are able and will
ing to make use of it and should not
solely relate to intellectual instruc
tion, but also instruction in such man
ual labor and simple industrial arts as
can be made practically available.
RAIEROAD LAND GRANTS.
Among the important subjects
wnicn are included in the sec
retary's report and what will doubt
less furnish occasion for congressional
action, may be mentioned the neglect
of the radroad companies to which
large grants of land were made by the
acts or istz ana ist4 to take title
thereto, and their consequent inequit
able exemption trom local taxation.
EDUCATION.
No survey of our material condition
can avail to suggest inquiries as the
moral and intellectual progress of the
people. The census returns discloses
an alarming state of illiteracy in the
main portions of the country where
the provision for schools is greatly in
adequate. It is a momentous ques
tion for the discretion of congress
whether immediate and substantial
aid should not be extended by the gen
eral government tor suppiemetmg the
effects of private beneficence and state
and territory legislation in behalf of
education.
INTER-STATE COMMERCE.
The regulation of inter-state com
merce has already been the subject of
your deliberations. One of the inci
dents of the marvellous extension of
the railway system of the country has
been the adoption of such measures
by the corporations which own or
control roads as hastened to impair
the advantages of healthful competi
tion and to make hurtful discrimina
tion in the adjustment of freightage.
These inequalities have centered in
several appropriate legislations, the
effect of which is necessarily restricted
to the limits of their own territory.
So far as such mischiefs affect com
merce between the states or between
any one of the states and the country,
they are subjects of national concern,
and congress alone can afford relief.
THE MORMONS.
The results which have thus far at
tended the enforcement of the recent
statute for the suppression of poly
gamy in the territories are reported by
the secretary of the interior. It is not
noticable that any additional legisla
tion in this regard will be deemed
desirable until the effect of existing
laws shall be more closely observed.
I congratulate you that the com
missioners under whose supervision
these laws have been put in operation
are encouraged to believe that the evil
at which they are aimed may le sup
pressed without resort to such radical
measures as in some qnarters have
been thought indispensable for suc
cess, l he close relation or the general
government to the territory preparing
to be great states may well engage
your attention. It is there that the
Indian disturbance may occur and
that polygamy has found root for its
growth. I cannot doubt that a careful
survey of territorial legislation would
be of the highest utility and life and
property would become more secure.
The liability of outbreaks between the
Indians and whites would be lessened.
The public domain would be more se
curely guarded and better progress be
made in the instruction of the young.
Alaska is still without any form of
civil government. If means were pro
vided for the education of its people
and for the protection of their lives
and property the immense resources of
the region would invite permanent
settlement and open new fields of in
dustry and enterprise.
THE FORESTS.
The report of the commissioner of
agriculture presents an account of the
labor of that department during the
past year and includes information of
much interest to the general public.
The condition of the forests of the
country aid the wasteful manner in
which their destruction is taking place
give cause for serious apprehension.
Their action in protecting the earth's
surface, in modifying the extremes
of climate and regulating and sustain
ing the flow of springs and streams is
now well understood, and their im
portance in relation to the growth and
prosperity of the country cannot lie
safely disregarded. They are fast dis
appearing before destructive fires, and
the legitimate requirements of our in
creasing population and their total ex
tinction cannot be long delayed, unless
better methods than now prevail shall
be adopted for their protection and
cultivation. The attention of congress
is invited to the necessity of additional
legislation to secure the preservation
of the valuable forests still remaining
on the public domains, especially in the
extreme western states and territories,
where the necessity for their preserva
tion is greater than in less moun
tainous regions, and where the
prevailing dryness of the climate
render their restoration if they are
once destroyed well nigh impossible.
CIVIL SERVICE.
The communication which I
made to congress at its first
session in December last con
tained a full statement of my senti
ments in relation to the princi
ples and rules which ought to govern
appointments to public service. Re
ferring to the various plans which had
heretofore been the subject of discus
sion in tne national legislature, plans
which in the main were modeled on
a system which obtains in Great Bri
tain but which lacked certain of the
prominent features whereby that sys
tem is distinguished, I felt bound
to intimate my doubts whether
they or any of them would afford
adequate remedy for the evils
which they aimed' to correct. I declare
nevertheless that if the proposed meas
ures should prove acceptable to con
gress they would receive the unhesi
tating support of the executive. These
suggestions were submitted for your
consideration, mere has been no
legislation upon the subject to which
they relate, but there has been an in
crease in the public interest on that
subject, and the people of the country,
apparently without distinction or
party, have in various ways and upon
frequent occsisions given expression to
their earnest wishes. Prompt and
definite action, in my judgment, should
no longer be postponed. I may add
that my own sense of its import
ance has been shown by observa
tion of the practical phase of the
matter to which attention hasmoie
than once been called by my prede
cessor. The civil list now comprises
about 100,000 persons, far the larger
part of whom must, under the term of
the constitution, be selected by the
president either directly or through
his own appointees. In the early
years of the administration of the
government the personal directions of
appointments of civil service may not
have been an irksome task for the
executive, but now that the burden
has increased fully a hundred
fold it has become much
greater than he ought to bear,
and it necessarily diverts his time and
attention from the proper discharge of
other duties, no lass delicate and re
sponsible, and which in the very na
ture of things cannot be delegated to
other hands. In my judgment, of not
a few who have given study and re
flection to this matter, the nation has
outgrown the provisions which the
constitution has established for filling
the minor oftices in the public service
but whatever may be thought of the
wisdom or expediency of chang
ing the fundamental law in
this regard, it is certain
that much relief may bo afforded not
only to the president and to the heads
of the departments, but to senators
and representatives iu congress ly
discreet legislation. They would be
Erotected in a great measure by the
ill now pending before the senate or
by any other which should embody
its important features, from the pres
sure of personal importunity and from
the labor of examining conflicting
claims and pretensions of candidates.
I trust that before the close of the
present session some decisive action
may be taken for the correction of the
evils which is burden the present meth
ods of an appointment, and I assure
you of my hearty co-operation in anv
measures which are likely to conduce
to that end. As to the most appro
priate term and tenure of the official
life of the subordinate employ
es of the government, it
seems to be generally agreed that
whatever extent the one should be de
finite and the other stable and that
neither should be regulated by zeal in
the service of party or fidelity to the
fortune by any individual. It matters
little to the people at large what com
petent person is at the head of this
department or of that bureau.
they feel assured that the removal of
one and the admission of another will
not involve the retirement of honest
and faithful subordinates whose du
ties are purely administrative and
have no legitimate connection with
the triumph or any political pnnci
pies or tne success or any
political party or faction. It
is to this latter class of officers that
the Knott bill, to which I have
already referred, exclusively applies,
while neither that bill nor any other
prominent scheme for improving the
civil service concerns the higher grade
of officials who are appointed by the
president and confirmed by the senute.
SELF DEFENSE.
I feel bound to correct a prevalent
misapprehension as to the frequency
with which the present executive has
displaced the incumbent of an office
and appointed another in his stead. It
has been repeatedly alleged that he
has m this particular signally departed
trom the course which has been pur
sued under the recent administra
tion of the government. The facts
are as follows: The whole num
ber of executive appointments
during the four years immediately
preceexling Mr. Garfield's accession to
the presidency was 2696 : of this num
ber 244, or nine per cent, included the
removal of previous incumbents. The
ratio of removals to the whole num
l)er of appointments was much the
same during each of these four years.
in tne nrst year, witn 4U ap
pointments, there were seventy-four
removals, or v d-iu per cent ; in the
second year, 917 appointments, there
were eighty-five removals, or 8 6-10
per cent ; in the third year, with 430
appointments, there were forty-eight
removals, or ten per cent : In the
fourth year, with 429 appointments,
there were thirty-seven removals, or
8 6-10 per cent. In the four months
of President Garfield's administration
there were 390 appointments and
eighty-nine removals, or 22 7-10 per
cent. Precisely the same number of
removals (eighty-nine) has taken place
in the fourteen months which have
since elapsed, but they constitute only
7 8-10 per cent of the whole number of
appointments (1118) within that period,
and less than 2 6-10 of the entire
list of officials 2459, exclusive of the
army and navy, which is filled by pres
idential appointment.
POLITICAL ASSESSMENTS.
I declare my approval of such legis
lation as may be found necessary for
supplementing the existing provisions
of the law in relation to political as
sessments. In July last I authorized
a public announcement that employes
of the government should regard
themselves as at liberty to exercise
their pleasure in making or refusing
to make political contributions, and
that their action in that regard would
in no manner affect their official
status. In this announcement I acted
on a view which I had always main
tained, and still maintain, that a pub
lic officer should be as abso
lutely free as any other citizen
to give or withhold contributions
for the aid of the political party of his
choice. It has, however, been urged,
and doubtless not without foundation
in fact, that by the solicitation of of
ficial superiors and by other modes
such contributions have at times tteen
obtained from persona whose only mo
tive tor giving has been the rear or
what might befall them if they re
fused. It goes to show, without say
ing so, that such contributions are
not voluntary and in my judgment
should be prohibited by law. A bill
which will enectuauy suppress tnem
will receive my cordial approval.
THE DISTRICT.
I hope that however numerous and
urgent may be the demands upon your
attention the interests of this district
will not be forgotten- The denial to
its residents of the great right of suf
frage in all ' its relations to national,
state and municipal action, imposes
upon congress the duty of affording
them the best administration which
its wisdom can devise. The report of
the district commissioners indicate
certain measures whose adoption
would be very desirable. I instance,
in particular, those which relate to ar
rears of taxes, to steam railroads and
assessments of real property.
THE PRESIDENTIAL SUCCESSION.
Among the questions which have
been the topics of recent debate in the
halls of congress none are of greater
gravity than those relating to the as
certainment of the vote for presiden
tial electors and the intendment of the
constitution in its provisions for
devolving the executive func
tions upon the vice president
when the president suffers from
inability to discharge the powers and
duties of his office. I trust that no
embarrassment may result from a
failure to determine these questions
before another national election.
REJOICB AND BE GLAD.
The closing year has been replete
with blessings for which we owe to
the Giver of all good our reverent ac
knowledgement. For the uninter
rupted harmony of our foreign rela
tions, for the end of sectional animos
ity, for the exuberence of our har
vests and the triumphs of our mining
and manufacturing industries, for the
preservation of health, the spread of
intelligence, and the conservation ft
our public credit, for the growth
of the country in all the
elements of national greatness,
for these and countless other
blessings we should rejoice and be
glad. 1 t rust that under the inspira
tion of this great proscrity our coun
sels may be harmonious and that the
dictates of prudence, patriotism, jus

WASHINGTON.
A REPUBLICAN SENATOR.
Washington, Dec. 4. Senator Van
Wyck, of Nebraska, Bays there is no
doubt whatever of the election of a
Republican ser ator to succeed Saun
ders; that most of the members elect
ed to the legislature who are anti
monopolists are Republicans.
POSTMASTER GENERAL' REPORT.
The report ot Postmaster General
Howe for the fiscal year Bhows the -
disbursements of the rxwtal service
during the year, $40,482,021; ordinary
receipts, $41 ,605,64 2; receipts from
money orders, $300,767; excess receipts,
$1,394,388. For the first time in three
years the postal service is not a bur
den on the treasury. In order to de
termine the real cost of the service for
the past year there should be deducted
from the total disbursement $442,386,
which, though paid out last
year, was for the service rendered
the previous year. There should '
be added $388,550 estimated due for ser-
vice rendered last ear. there shonld ;
also be added $1,178,174 earned by rail-
road companies for the transportation
of mails between the Missouri river and
the Pacific, The accounts thus stated
shows the earnings to le but $35,OoO , '
deficiency for the previous fiscal yea
was $2,406,338. In I860 the deficiency
was more than $10,000,000. Some part
of this great improvement is due to
the wonderful growth and prosperity
or the country, but the larger part B
due to the improved methods in the
administration of the service. The ,
heaviest item of expenditure is '
for the transportation of mails on rail
roads. The next heaviest is that for
postmasters. Thiwe two items muHt
swell with the volume of business,
since the rate of compensation is pro
portional to the amount or business
done. The expenditure next in rank
is lor what is known as the star route
service that includes all transportation
not on railways nor on sUarnioat.
The amount and cost is left wholly to
the arbitrary control of the depart
ment. For the year ending J une 3o,
1881, the star route service covered
7,557,296 miles of transportation
at a" cost of $09,557.35. For
the year ended June 30, 1882, the
same service covered 7,692,486 miles
and cost $5,638,4 X). Estimates for
1884 promise the financial results still
more flattering. From money orders
the net revenue w as $436,528. Total
estimated revenue, $50,670,456: total
expenditures estinated at $ii,41,lll;
estimated excess of the revenue, $:!,
929,045. In the report of x irst Assistant I'.
M. General Hatton. it is shown that
the estimate for compensation for
postmasters Li largely in excess of the
sum appropriated or asked for during
the current year. T he reason assigii-d
is that the sum appropriated is v twlly
inadequate to pay off the postmasters
is limited not by the appropriation
bills but by fixed statutes, and to the
extent of their lejral compensations
the gross revenue of the postal service. .
is not only appropriated, but hypothe
cated to their payment.
It is reported th.'.t Ex-Senntor IXr
sey is seriously ill.
