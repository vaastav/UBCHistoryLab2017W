Our Taxes.
Taxpayers arc prone to complain of
their tax assessment, in iaci nicy kick
wh tlher tho levy Is high or low, and
only one out of a hundred will atop to
consider the benefit he receives in return
for tho taxes ho pnyo. Tako for oxam
pie, a North Platte resident, such as
this writer. In payment of his personal
tax for 1910 ho found that tho total
stuto and county tax was $14. CO, the
total city tax $17 20, tho total school
tax $22.80 nnd tho poll tax $2.00. It
will bo observed that tho highest Item
is that for schools, nnd practically in
ovory town and precinct in Lincoln
county It will bo found that this item
leads the othors. In North Platte it
costs $20 per pupil per year to educate
our children, so that the man who hns
thrto children In school can figuro that
tho cost to the school district for edu
cating his three children is $00 per year.
How many of us nay $60 por year taxes
for tho support of the schools)? Isnt It
evident tho more wealthy men or tho
men without children are helping to
educate the children of nine-tenths of
tho tox-payors? Then why complain of
your school tax, you pcoplo who have
children In school?
Tho next highest item in the Hat is
city tax. In return for this wo have
fire protection, police protection, sewer
systom, electrically lightod streets,
good streets and crosswalks, all of
which aro beiroflt or convenience or both.
Would you do without thoso for tho
sum they cost you? We Milnk not; if wo
did not have theso conveniences you
would holler your head off.
Tho combined county and stnto tax is
just about one-fourth of the total paid
by a North Platte citizen. This tux
maintains Our statu Institutions, our
courts, our stnto and county officials,
keepj up highways In road districts,
maintains our bridges, meets election
expenses, takes care of our poor who
need aid, nnd defrays other oxpenscs,
all of which aro absolutely necossaryin
o der that wo may enjoy tho benefits
ol' an advanced civilization. And when
you think of these things, do you really
think you hnvo a kick n-comlng? Taxes
in Lincoln county may bo u shade
higher than in somo other counties, but
the bigness of the county makes ex
penses high. Wo havo forty-throe pre
cincts moro than twice the number in
the averago county In tho oast part of
the state. This makes our elections
expensive; It costs u big sum to make
tho assessment; tho county is bo largo
that the mllonge charge of n juror or a
wI'ncBS attending court Is often greater
than his court foes; wo havo twice the
number of miles of road ns has tho nv
eriugo county and thoso must bo main
tained; we havo eight or ten bridges
across tho Platto rivors that must be
kopt in repair; in fact our county Is so
big and so comparatively spnrsoly set
tled that we really ought to congratuluto
our Ralvqs thntour taxes nro not hlghor.
History of Red Cross Seals.
Tho Red Cross Christmas seals that
aro now on sale at many of tho stores
In North Platto dnto bnck in thoir or
igin to "jhnrity stnmps" first used for
the soldiers' rcllof funds in Boston in
1802, during tho Civil War. After the
war, this method of raising monoy was
discontinued In this country for a gen
eration, although it found vogue In
Portugal, Switzerland Australia, Franco,
Spain, Denmark, Norway, Russia Swe
den and other European countries,
There nro now several hundred differ
ent types of charity stamps used in all
parts of the world.
Stamps St seals were first used to
got monoy for tho anti-tuberculosis
crusade in Norway and Sweden In 1904.
After being used in theso countries for
tnreo years, as a direct result of tho in
to rent of Jacob Riis in this movement,
tho Dulowaro Anti-Tuberculosis As
sociation, headed by Miss Emily P.
Hlsiell, and tho Rod Cross Socloty of
Delewaro combined In Issuing u Tuber
culosis Stamp. So successful was this
campaign that nearly $3,000 wns ro-
auzeu. anu tno next yonr, in iuua, tho
American Rod Cross was induced to
issue a National Red Cross Tuberculosis
Stamp. From this snlo $1113.000 was
realized, that amount being almost
doubled in lPOi). This veur for thollr.it
time, tho snlo Is organized on a compre
hensive basis, taking in nil parts of

Gist of President's Message.
President Taft submitted his mes
sage to congress Tuesday. The prin
cipal features aro:
Ha declares it Is time to stop legis
lating with reference to regulation of
corporations and to witness the ef
fect, of a vigorious execution of the
laws already on tho statute books. The
exact limitation upon business meth
ods imposed by law will doubtless be
made clearer by pending decisions of
the supremo court.
Just nt this time, the president says,
ho believes the activities of tho gov
ernment, in addition to enforcement of
the laws should bo directed toward
economy of adminstration, the enlarge
ment of opportunities for foreign trade,
tho building up of homo Industry and
the strengtning of confidence of capital
In domostlc Investment.
Mr. Taft recommends strongly somo
form of ship subsidy to incrcaso Amor
lean shipping, especially to South
America.
The tariff board is not ready to sub
mit a report of any of tho schedules of
tho Payne law, and Mr. Taft says, ho
ho will not recommend any tariff leg
islation until tho new congress con
venes In December 1911.
He urges Mint tho tariff board be
modo permanent and that all future re
visions be mado schedule by schedule
He vigoriously opposes another general
revision.
The Panama canal should bo fortified.
An appropriation of $19,000,000 is rec
ommended for this purposo.
There must bo no moro "pork barrel"
methods in river and harbor nnd public
building bills. The latter should be
based upon tho report of n' commission
of experts. In tho past congress has
appropriated too much for buildings not
needed nnd not enough for buildings
badly needed.
Recommendation for anti-Injunction
and federal incorporation laws are re
newed. It is proposed that second class mail
rates shall bo readjusted no as tochargo
mngazincs a much higher rate on their
advertising tactions.
Strong representations nro mado for
tho establishment of a new bnnking
and currency systom.
Two now battleship and soveral aux
iliary vessels aro urged for tho navy.
Tho president recommends thnt coal
liosphato nnd oil lands and water
power sites bo disposed of in the fu
ture uy leasing.
Estimates for tho government ox-1
penuitures uuring tno next liBcal year
Iiavo been cut to $630,013.12, which is
$52,001,887.00 less than tho actual ap
propriations for tho current year. Tho
estimated receipts for tho noxt fiscal
yenr aro $080,000,000.
The President urges tho extension of
tho civil scrvico principle to tho diplo
matic and consular corps and tho ac
quisition by the government of resi
dences nnd of offices for its diplo
matic officers,
Somo criticisms of tho Payno tariff
act aro just, Bays the president, but
moro aro unfounded.
Thore should bo moro officers for tho
nrmy. Tho engineering corpso should
be increased by Blxty.
Tho fortifications nt Correcrldor island.
Manila bay nnd nt Pearl harbor, Ha
waii, should bo hurried to early com-
iciion.
In rcenrd to tho Panama canal tho
president sayB: "Tho progress of tho
work is most satisfactory. It will bo
comploted woll within tho tlmo set,
January 1, 1916, and within tho estim
mated coat of $375,000,000. Tho slides
in Culcbra cut olfer no great reason for
iieiay,"
Tho stupendous volume of agricultural
products, amounting to S8.020.000.000
this year, Indicntes a good prospect for
uusincss tnrouguout the country.
Tho present census promises to be the
best over taken, but is not perfect.
Tho census padders aro to be vigorously
