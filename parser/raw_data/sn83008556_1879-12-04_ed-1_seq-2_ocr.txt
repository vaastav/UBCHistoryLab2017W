ANOTHftRTRIBUTARY.
Tho LewiPbnra-, Centre and Sprueo
Creek Railroad to Paea to
tho Pennsylvania P.all
road Company.
The Pennsylvania railroad company
w ill soon add another line ot rails and
ties to its long list of branches in the
foreclosure of the mortgage of the
Lewisburg, Centre and Spruce Creek
railroad company, whose bonds it holds
in the sum of $2,000,000. In 1877
the people of Peon's valley, one of the
richest valleys of the state, with the
assistance of the Pennsylvania railroad,
opened tiro now insolvent road from
from Lewisburg, on tlie Northern Cen
tra! railroad, as far as Spring Mills, in
Perm's valley, a distance of forty-two
miles, with the intention in the future,
should business warrant the scheme, >f
extending tho line to Tyrone, on the
main line of the Pennsylvania railroad
the entire length of the road to bo t igh
ty-four miles. Beyond the completed
portion there are about seventeen miles
of the road graded, but as yet without
superstructures. The original object
of the new line was to open up exten
sive ore banks located in that section
of the country, but the business of the
country thus far lias been limited to
the transportation of agricultural pro
ducts down from Penn's valley and
carrying kick coal and s'ore goods.
! The Pennsylvania railroad really built
! the line by advaucing the $2,000,000 to
the company and taking their hist
. mortgage bonds for the money so ad
vanced, and the foimer corporation has
; held au operating lease of it ever since.
But the venture thus far has proved
unprofitable, so much so that the un
paid interest on the bonds has accumu
lated to nearly the face value of the
: bonds themselves. At last the Ponu
| eylvania railroad company has deter
; mined to foreclose the mortgage, wipe
J out the capital stock, which represents
I only about $250,00J, and assume the
! absolute ownership and management of
I the branch. It will be sold Ait t'e
] Philadelphia exchange by James A.
Freeman & Co., auctioneers, on the
13th, iast., and there is no possibility
of any one stepping in to ootbi 1 the
bondholders, to do which they must re
| lieve the mortgage of the load it now
| carries.— Harrisburg Patriot.
The Republicans have only 1,800
majority in Massachusetts. They
ought to be ashamed of theanelvos
with such a contemptible figure as that
for the Bay state.
The statue to the brave soldier, Gen.
Thomas, was inaugurated by the army
of the Cumberland, at Washington.
There was no volunteer military organ
ization from the North present, but
several companies from the South were
there to do the great soldier honor.
Gen. Jefferson C. Davis, prominently
known as an able general of the Union
Army, died at Chicago last week.
Additional Locate.
—Philip B. Stover, of Haines town
ship, will offer his entire farm stock and
farmiug utensils at public sale on
Wednesday, the 17th of December.
Head the bills.
—Wcsee by the Mittlinburg Telegraph
that to-day two weeks ago Musser's
store in Ilartleton was entered by
thieves and a number of hats and some
"small change''stolen.
—The Uuion County Teachers' Insti
tute will meet at Lewisburg, Monday,
Dec. lath, and adjourn Friday, Dec.
ISth. That's a sensible time in which
to hold an institute. Don't consider it
at al' proper to have it just on and the
days before and after Christmas.
—The Journal Book Store is rapidly
filling up with goods and the assort
ment is or will soon be very complete.
The house is complete, wo have moved,
and are now in a condition to give our
business our undivided attention.
Don't fear to find the door locked—ex
cepting at meal time—when you come,
or nobody here to serve you. It is our
purpose as it will be our pleasure, to
make business boom, and deserve the
patronage of the public.
—Schoch, of tho Ickqraph is a real
selfish fellow. He talks of buying the
lailroad all alone. Now why couldn't
lie give us a chance too, or at least pro
pose a partnership, the impudent imp ?
—The last one of eight crossings was
completed the other day. They add
much to the convenience of tho town
aud are fully worth all they cost, al
though we would haye preferred to
have them considerably nicer and better.
—The MILLHEIM MARBLE WORKS
are turning out some very fine work
this season. Monuments, Couches and
Headstones of any possible design and
price are made here, equal in workman
ship and as low in price as can be had
anywhere in the state. If you need
something to mark the last resting
place of a departed friend, you can do
no better than by staying right at home
and patronizing the Millhcim Works.
—Judge Mayor and wife are at the
Hot Springs, Ark. in quest of health.
—Spring Mills' enterprising mer
chant, Mr. I. J. (Jrenoble, gives notice
that he will be at Coburn Station every
Tuesday, buying grain and clover-seed.
We presume Mr. (.. is prepared to pay
the highest market price lor everything
he buys.
—l>id you ever see a five cent, or ten
cent counter ? If you call at the Jouu
xaß. Book Stork, you can see both.
It is absolutely astonishing what a
largo number of small articles, both
useful and ornamental, can be bought
for live or ten dents. But we ca: not
even begin to enumerate, thereto!c
please come and see.
"I'ktrkson'B Magazine" for De
cember is on our tattle in advance, and
is a marvel of beauty, even far ''Peter
son." There are two a: eel engravings,
one called "The Pet Pigeons," an ex
quisite affair, and the other a title
page, representing a beautiful little
child, asleep in his crib, with a rose
bud in liis band, after a picture by the
celebrated English artist, Millais. The
colored fashions, also a steel plate, is
one of the loveliest we have ever seen.
Then there is a treble-sized colored pat
tern, in Berlin work, for an Ottoman,
or Chair Seat, a Christmas gift given
extra, to the subscribers of "Peterson."
The literaly contents are even better
than usual, and this is saying a great
ileal ; Mrs. Frances Hodgson Burnett,
Mrs. Ann S. Stephens, Frank Lee Ben
edict, and the author of "The Second
Life," etc., etc., being among the con
tributors. One of the best and most
amusing stories we have ever read, and
by a eompaiitively new author ("Peter
son", somehow is always finding cut
the best aeio authors,) is called "Baby
Stealing." The fullsizi paper pattern
given as a Stupmsmfx r, is for the la
test style of a inter cloak. Beyond all
doubt, this is the cheapest an I list of
the lady's books, for it is only two dol
lars a year to single subscribers, with
great deductions to clubs. In fact, for
nine dollars, six copies will be sent f<.r
188 \ tcith a extra copy for yetting up
the club. Specimens are iu.iled, gratis,
if written for, to those wishing to get
up a club. Now is the tiins to get up
clubs for next'year. Address, Ch vs.
