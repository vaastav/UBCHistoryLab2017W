PREPAREDNESS WITH A PUNCH.
Yet -
Much has been said and written during the
at- past two years as to national preparedness. From
1 present indications it would appear to be the
policy of the country to bring defensive prepared
ness to the point where we feel secure should the j
unforseen occur. This policy is resulting in the|
of building of large and more modern battleships,!
more efficient coast defenses, the strengthening[

Editor Daily Commonwealth:

I appreciate what our beloved South endured in her
struggle for Constitutional liberty,

Ipant, disparaging references to the "hardships!
and sufferings" of our people in those trying days, i
"privations and sacrifices" which this Northern |

troops'connection I beg to refer to the lamentable imbifevI

THE PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE.
The Daily Commonwealth gave its readers yes
terday afternoon President Wilson's complete
message to Congress, which was delivered at one !
o'clock on that day. The Memphis News-Scimi
tar only gave its readers a half column news item
about the message, and the Commercial Appeal
published the address this morning. That's the
difference between a real live afternoon paper and j
the less progressive ones 1 —and the difference,
from a news service standpoint, between the up
to- date afternoon newspaper and the morning
publication, is so largely in favor of the former
that comparison is ridiculous.
