their application to the present state of affair, well
aware that the efficiency of mj latiora will, in a
great measure, depend on jour and their und'md
eJ approbation.
Hie Union of the United States of America w.19
Intended by it author to remain as long aa the
States themselves shall last. "The Union shall
be perpetual," are the wordjof the Confederation.
"To form a more perfect Union," by an ordinance
of the people of the United States, in the declared
purpose of the Constitution.. The hand of Divine
Providence was never mor plainly visible in the
affair, of dien, than tit the framing and the adop
tion of that instrument. It is, beyond comparison,
the greaUit event in American history, and indeed
is it not, ot all venu in modern times, tho most
pregnant with consoo.ucnces for ererj people oftlic
earth? Tho racmbera of the Convention which
prepared it brought to their work the experience
of the ' Jonfcdcruion, of tlicir several States, and
of other Republican Governments, old and new.
But llicy needed and they obtained a wisdom su
perior to r xpcrleiice. And when lor iu validity U
required the approval of a people that occupied a
large part of a continent, and acted separately in
manv di.-tinct Conventions, what it more wonder
ful titan that, after earnest contention nnd long i
Uicuton, all feelings nnd all opinions were Ulli'
mately drawn 1 1 one way to it support?
The Constitution to which life waj ihu impart- J
ed contains wTfhin itself ample resources lor it own j
preservation. It 1ms power to en force the laws, ;
pmusn treason, ami insure nomes:ic tranquility.
in caso. of ti c usurpation of the Government ol a
State by one man, or an oligarchy, it becomes a
duty of the United States to nuke good the guar
antee to that State of a republican form of govern
ment, and s to maintain the homogencousness or
all. Dots the Ijpsc of time reveal defects? A
simple mode of aiueuJincrit i provided ia the ('D
stitutiun itself, so that its conditions can always be
m.vJe to conform to the requirements of advancing
civilization. No room is allowed even for the
thought of a possibility of its coming to an end.
And these power of self preservation have always
been averted in tlicir complete integrity by crcry
patriotic Chief Magistrate 1y Jefferson and Jack
iMin, not 1j.s than by Wa.iliinUju and .Mitdison.
The p.trting advice of Iii Father if his Country,
while yet President, to the people of the United
Slates, was, that "tlie free Constitution, which was
the work of their hands, might be sacredly i 11
tained;'' and the inaugural words of Preside.".1" Jef
ferson held up "the preservation of the General
Government, in its constitutional vigor, as the
sheet ancW of ; onr peace- at homo and vafcty
abroad." The Constitution is the work of "the
People of the United States," and it should be as
indestructible as the people.
It is not strange that the framers ol the Con
stitution, whieli had no model in the past, should
not have fully comprehenned the excellence of
their own work. Fresh from a struggh) against
arbitrary power, manv patriots suffered from har
assing fear of an absorption of the State Govern
ment by the general Government, and mtny from
the dread that the States would break away from
their ortiits. Hut the very greatness f our coun
try sliouldalljy tho apprehension of eiicroachmrntJ
by the general Government. The subjects that
come unquestionably within its jurisdletion are so
rnimcrouMhat it mast ever naturally refu-e to be
embarrassed by questions that lie bevond it.
Were "! otherwise, the Rxecntire would sink be
ttalh the burden; the; channels of justice would be
choked; legislation would be obstructed by CICSM;
so that there is a greater temptation to exercis
some of the functions of the general Government
through the Plates than to trespass on thtir right-
- ful sphere. '! he absoluta acqme.encc in the de
' cisious of the mnjoi ity" was, at the beginning of
the century, enforced by Jefferson "as the vital
principle of Republics," and the events of tha last
four years have established, we w:ll hope forever,
that there lies no appeal to force.
The niaiutenance of the Union bring, with it
"the support of the State Governments in all their
rights;" but it is not one of the rights of any State
Government to renounce its ewn place in the
Union, or to nullify the laws of the Union. The
largest liberty ia to be maintained in the discussion
of the acts of the Fvdenl Government; but there
is no appeal from its laws, except to the various
branches of that Government itself, or to the peo
ple, who grant the members of the Legislative and
of the Executive Departments no tenure but a lim
ited one, and in that manner always retain the
powers o' redress.
The sovereignty of the States" is the language
of the Confederacy, and not tho language of the
Constitution. The latter contains the emphatic
words: "The Constitution, and the laws of the
United States which hall be made in pursuance
thereof, and all treaties ni.ido or which shall be
made under the authority of the United States,
shall be the supreme law of the land; and trie judg
es in crcrj Suto shall bo bound Ihercbj, anything
in the constitution or laws of any State to the con
trary notwithstanding."
Certainly the Government of the Uuited States is
a limited government; aud so is every State gor
rrnment a limited government. With us, this
idf a of limitation sprsads through everv form of
administration, general, state and muuicipal, and
rests on the great distinguishing principle bf the
recognition of the rights of man. The ancieut re
publics absorbed 'the individual in the State, pres
cribed his religion, and controlled his activity.
The American ey.-tem rests on the assertion of the
equal rights of every man to life, liberty and the
pursuit of happiness; to freedom' of conscience, to
the enlture and exercise of all his faculties. As a
consequence, the State government is limited, as
to the general Government in the interest of
Union, as to thc'Ibdividual ciliacn in the interest
of freedom.
States, ititli proper limitations of power, are es
sential to the existence of the Constitution of the
United States. At the Tery commencement, when
we assumed a place among the Powers of the earth,
the Declaration of Independence was adopted by
States; so also were the Articls of Confederation;
and when "the Teople of the United States" or
dained and established the Constitution it was the
assent of the Siatrp, one by one, which gave it vi
tality. In the event, too, of any amendment to
the Constitution, the pro(-o? ition of Congress needs
the confirmation of the Stales. Without States,
one great branch of the legislative Government
would be wanting. And, if we look b eyond the '
letter of tue Constitution, to the character of our
cocntrv its capacity for comprehending within its
jurisdiction a vast continental empire is duo to the
system of 5 Utes. lue best security lor the per
petual existence of the States, is tho "supreme au
thority" of the Constitution of the United States.
The perpetuity of iho Constitution brings with it
the perpetuity of the Skates; their mutual relation
makes us what we are, and in oar political system
their connection is indissoluble. The whole can
not exist without the parU, nor the parts without
tho whole. So long as the Constitution of the
United States endures, tire States will endure; the
tcstmction of the one is the destruction of the
ether; the preservation of the one is the preserva
tion of the other.
I have thus explained my Tiew of the mutual
relations of the Constitution and the States, be
cause they unfold the principles on which I hare
nougni to soive me roomentou juuVui auu over-1 proclamation oi tne executive, i toos tcr my
come the appaling difficulties that met me at the counsel the Constitution itself, the interpretations
very commencement of my administration. It has ofthat instaument by Its authors and their contem

1 found the States ufTering from the eflects of
a civil war. Resistance to the general Govern
ment apneared to have exhauated itself. The
United tattts h.td recovered posKesnion of their
fort and ar?cuals; and their armies were in the
occupation of every Stitt which had attempted
toseccde. Whether the territory within tho limits

emigration to and from that portion of the country
is one of the best means that can bo thought of for
the restoration of barmour; and that emigration
would hare been prcTcnted; for what emigrate
from abroad, what indnstriout citizen at home,
would place himself willin;;ly under military rule?
The chief persons who would hare followed in the
train of the army wou'd havo been dependents on
the general Government, r men who expected
profit from the miseriei of their erring fcllow citi-tens-
The powers of patronage and rule which
would have been exercised, under th President,
over a vast, and populous, and uaturalljr wealthy
region, are greater than, utiles under extreme nc
ccseity. I should be willing to eutrnst to any one
man; they aro such as, for myself, 1 could never,
unless on occasions of great emergency, consent
to exercise. The willful use of such powers, if
continued through a psriod of jears, would hare
endangered the purity of the general administra
tion aod the liberties of the States which remained
loyal.
Besides, this policy of miUlnry rule over a con
quered territory would have implied that tho
States whose inhabitants may hare taken part iu
the rebellion lud, by the acs of those inhabitants,
ceased to exist. But the true theory is, that all
pretended acts of secession were, from the begin
ning, null nd void. The State cannot commit
treason, nor screen the individual citizen who ma
have committed treason, any more thau they can
unke valid treaties or engage in lawful commerce
with any foreign power. The States attempting
to accede placed themselves in a condition where
their vitality was impaired, but not extinguished
their functions suspended, but not destroyed.
But if anv State neplects or refuses to perform
its offices, there is the more need that the general
Government should maintain iti authority, and,
as soon as practicable, resume the exercise of all
its functions. On this principle I have acted, and
hare gradually and quielly, und bj almo
ceptible steps, sought to restore the rit;htfi
ost imper-
ful euerer
of the ceneral Government and of the States. To
1 that end, Provisional Governor have been ap
pointed for the States, Conventions called. Gov
ernors elected. Legislatures assembled, and Sen
ators and Representative choscu to the Congress
of the United States. At the same time. Kle
Courts ol the United States, as lar as could bo
done, have been reopened, so that the laws of the
United Stiles may be enforced through their
agency. The blockade has been removed and the
custom-houses re established in ports of entry, so
that the-revemie of the United States may be col
lected. The Post Office Department renews its
ceaseless activity, and the general Governments is
thereby enable I to communicate promptly with it
ofiictrs and agents. The courts bring eecurity to
persons and property; the opening of the ports in
fitci the restoration of industry and commerce;
the postofiice renews the facilities of social inter
course and of busiiiciis. And is it riot happy for us
all, that the restoration of each one of these func
tions of the general G'jvcrumcMit brings with it a
blessing to the States over which they are extend
ed? Is it not a sure promise of harmony awl re
newed attachment to the Union that, after all that
has happened, the return of the general Govern
ment is known only as a beneficence T
I know very well that this policy is attended
with some risk; that for its success it requires at
lea?t the acquiesence of the States which it con
cerns; that it implies an invitation to those States,
by renewing their allegiance to the United States,
to resume their functions as States of the Union.
Dut it is a risk that must be taken; in the choice
of difficulties, it is ;be smallest risk; and to dimin
ish, and, if possible, to remove all danger, I have
felt it incumbent on me t assert one other power
of the General Government the power of pardon.
As uo State can throw a defence over the crime
of treason, the power of pardon is exclusively vest
ed in the Executive Government of the United
States. In exercising that power, I hare taken
every precaution to connect it with the clearest
recognition of the binding force of the laws of the
United States, and an unqualified acknowledg
ment of the great social change of condition in
regard to slavery which has grown out of the war.
The next step whic'i I have taken to restore the
constitutional relations of the States, has been an
invitation to them to participate in the high office
of amending the Constitution. Everj patriot mutt
wish for a general amnesty at the earliest epoch
consistent with public safety. For this great end
there is need of a concurrence ofall opiuions, and
the spirit of mutual conciliation. All parties in
the I.ito terrible conflict must work together in
harmony. It is not too much to ask, in the name
of the whole people, that, on the one side, the plan
of restoration shall proceed in confirmity with a
willingness to cast the disorders of the past into
oblivion; and. that, on the other, the evidence of
sincerity in the future maintenance of the Union
shall be put beyond any doubt by the ratification
of the proposed amendment to the Constitution,
which provides for the abolition of slavery forever
within the limits of our country. So long as the
adoption of this amendment is delayed, so long
will donbt, and jealousy, and uncertainty, prevail.
This is the measure which will efface the sad
memory of the past; this is the measure which will
mostVertainly call population, and capital, and
security to those parts of tho Union that need
them most. Indeed,, it is not too much to ak of
the States which are now rcr Jming their places in
the family of the Union to give this pledge of
perpetual loyalty and peace. Until it is done, the
past, however much we may desire it, will not be
forgotten. The adoption of the amendment re
unites us beyond all powtr of disruption. It heals
the wound that is still imperfectly closed; it re
moves slavery, the element which has en long per
plexed and divided the country; it makes of us
ouco more a united people, renewed and strength
ened, bound more than ever to mutual affection
and support.
Tho amendment to the C nstitution being
adopted, it would remain for the States, whoso
powers have been so long in abeyance, to resume
their places in the two branches of the National
Legislature, and thereby complete the work of
restoration. Here it is for yon, fellow-citizens of
the Senate, and for you, fellow-citizens of the
House of Representatives, to judge, each of you
for yourselves, of the elections, returns and quali
fications of your own members.
The full assertion of the powers of tho General
Government requires the holding of Circuit Courts
of the United States within the districts where
their authority has been interrnpted. In the pres
ent posture or our public afiairs, strong objections
have been urged to holding those courts in any of
the States where tho rebellion has existed; and it
was ascertained, by inquiry, that the Circuit Court
of the Unifed States would not be held within the
District of Virginia during the autumn or early
winter, nor nntil Congress should have "an oppor
tunity to consider and act on the who'.e subject."
To your deliberations the restoration of this
branch of the civil authority of the United .States
is therefore necessarily referred, with the hope
that early provision will be made for the resump
tion fall its functions. It is manifest that trea
son, most flagrant in character, has been commit
ted. Persons who are charged with iti commission
should hare fair and impartial trials in the highest
civil tribunals of tno country, in order tost the
Constitution and the lawa maybe fully vindicated;
tho truth clearly established and affirmed that trea
son is a crime, that traitors should be punished
and the offence nude infamous; and. at tho tame
time, that the question may b judicially settled,
finally and forever, that no Ute of its own will
baa the right to renounce its place ia tho Union. -The
relations of the General Government to
wards the four million of inhabitants whom the
war bu called into freedom, hare engaged . my
rnost serious consideration. On the propriety of
attempting to make the freed men electors by the

reservation of power in the habits ol the people,
and so unquestioned has beeu tho Interpretation of
the Constitution, that during the civil war the late
Pre.ident never harbored the purpose certainly
never avowed the nnrpose of disregarding it; and
in the acts of Congress, during that period, noth-
ing can be fouud which, during the continuance of
hostilities, much .less after their close, would
have sanctioned any departure by the Exccutirc
from a policy which has so uniformly obtained.

form usage for dv State to enlarge the body of j tiers, who may thas at any time acquire the tillo

have liei-n an nasiimntinn of riwer bv tho Presi-1
dent which nothing in the Constitution or lawa
of
the United States would have warranted.
On the other hand, every danger of conflict
IS
aroidod when the settlement of the question is
referred to the several States. They can, each for
it9olf, decide on the measure, and whether it is to
be adopted at once and absolutely, or introduced
gradually and with conditions. In my judgment,
the freedmen, if they Fhow patience nnd manly
virtues, will aoonet obtain a participation in the
elective franchise throngh the State than through
the General Government, even if it had power to
intervene. When the tumult of emotions that
have been r.sised by the suddenness of the social
change shall have subsided, it may prove that they
will receive the kindliest usage from some of
those on whom they have heretofore most closely
depetided.
Dut white I hare no doubt that r.ow, after the
close of the war, it is not competent for tho
General Government to extend the elective fran
chise in the sevexil States, it is equally clear lhat
goxl faith req lires the security of the freedmen
in their liberty und their property, their right to
labor, and their right to claim ihejuH return cf
their labor. I cannot too strongly urge a dispas
sionate treatment of this subject, whieh should be
cirefully kept aloof from all party strife. We
must equally avoid linsty assumption o( sny natu
ral impossibility for the two races to live side by
side, in a st.itc of niutu.il benefit and good will.
The experiment involves us in no inconsistency;
let us then, go on and make that experiment in
pood faith, aud net be too easily disheartened.
The country is in need of labor, and the freedmen
sre in need of employment, culture and protection.
While their right of voluntary migration and
expatriation is not to be questioned, I would not
advise tlicir forced removal and colonization.
Let u rather encourage them to honorable and
useful industry, where it may be beneficial to
themselves and to the country; and instead of
hnisty anticipations of the eertai nty of failure. let
there ee nothing wanting to the fair trial of the
experimeiit. The chango in their condition is the
Substitution of labor by contract for the status of
shivery. The freedmen cannot fairly be accused
of unaillingncss to work, so long as a doubt re
mains about his freedom of choice in hi? pursuits,
and the certainty cf his recovering his stipulated
wages. Iu this the iutercsts of the employer nnd
the employed coincide. The employer desires in
his workmen spirit and alacrity, and these can be
permanently secured in no other way. And if the
one ought to be able to enforce the contract, so
ought the other. The public interest will be best
promoted if the several States will provide
adequate protection and remedies for the freed,
men. Until this is in some way accomplished,
there is no chance for the, advantageous use of
their labor; and the blame of ill-success will not
rest on them.
I know thatsiucere philanthropy is earnest for
the immediate realisation of its remotest aims; but
time is always an element in reform. It is one of
the greatest acts ou record to have brought four
millions of people into freedom. The career of
free industry must be fnirly opened to them; and
then their future prosperity aud condition must,
after all, rest mainly un themselves. If they fail,
aod so perish away, let us be careful that the fail
ure shal not be attributable to any denial of jus
tice. In all that relates to the destiny of the
freedmen, we need not be too anxious to read the
future; m iny incidents which, from a speculative
point of view, might raite alarm, will quietly settle
themselves.
Now that blarery is at an end, or near its end,
the greatness of its evil, in the point of view of
public economy, become moro and more apparent.
Slavery was essentially a monopoly of labor, and
as such locked the States where it prevailed against
the incoming of free industry. Where labor was
the property of the capitalist, the white man was
excluded from employment, or had but the second
best chance of lindinjj it, and the foreign emigrant
turned away from the region where his condition
would be so precarious. With the destruction of
the monopoly, free 11 or will hasten from nil parts
of the civilized world to assist in developing vari
ous aqd innumerable resources widen have hither
to lain dormat.t. Tho eight or nino States nearest
the Gulf of Mexico have a 6oil of exuberant fer
tility, a climate friendly to long life, and can sus
tain a deuser population thau is found as yet in any
part of our country. And the future influx of
population to them will be mainly from the North,
or from thi. most cultivated nations in Europe.
From the sufferings that bare attended them du
ring our late struggle, let m look away to the fu
ture, which is sure to be laden for them with great- j
er prosperity than has ever before been known.
The removal of the monopoly of slave labor is a
pledge that tho&e regions w ill be peopled by a nu
merous and enterprising population, which will vie
with any in the Union for compactness, inventive
genius, wealth and Industry.
Our G jvernment spriDgs from and was made for
the people not the people for the Government.
To them it owes allegiance; from them it must de
rive its courage, strength and wisdom. But, while
the Government is thus bound to defer to the
people, from whom it derives its existence, it
should, from .the very consideration of its origin,
be strong in its power of resistance to the estab
lishments of inequalities. Monopolies, perpetui
ties, and class legislation, are contrary to the ge
nius of free government, and ought not to be al
lowed. Here, there is no room for favored classes
or monopolies; the principle of our Government is
that of equal laws snd freedom of industry.
Wherever monoply attains a foothold, it is sure to
be a source of danger, discord, and trouble. Wc
shall but fulfill our duties as legislators by accord
ing "equal aud exact justice to all men," special
privileges to none. The Government is subordi
nalc to the people, but, as the agent and represen
tative of the people, it must be held superior to
monopolies, which, in themselves, ought never to
be granted, aud which, where they exist, must be
subordinate aud yield to the Governmeut.
The Constitution confers on Congress the right
lo regulate commerce among the several States.
It is of the first necessity, for the mamtsnance of
the Linon, that that commerce should be free and
unobstructed. No State can be iustiSed in anv
device to tax the transit of travel and commerce be
tween StatC3. The position of many States ia such
that, if they were allowed to take advantage of it
for purposes of local revenue, the commerce be
tween States might be injuriously burdened, or
even virtually prohibited. It is best, whilo the
couutry is still young, and while the tendency to
dangerous monopolies of this kind is still feeble,
to use the power of Congress so as to prevent any
selfish impediment to the free circulation of men
and merchandise. A tax oa travel and merchan
dise, in their transit, constitutes one of the worst
forms of monopoly. and the evil is increased if
COUDled With a denial Of thO Choice OI route.
When the rast extent of our country is i considered, reduction of the currency is the only tBeaswr that
it is plain that every obstacle to the free circula- n BtTe tne business of the country from disaa
tion pf commerce between the States ought to be trous calamities; and this can be alnnst impercep

In the report of the Secretary of War, a generef
summary is given of tho military campaigns of
ItCi and Ir-Gi, endiug in the suppression of armed
resistance to the national authority iu the insur
gent States. The operations of the general ad
ministrative Bureaus of the War Department da
ring the pa.-t year are detailed, and an estimate
made ol the appropriations that will be required
for military purposes in the fiscal year, commenc
ing the 30th day of June, lsb'G. The national
military force or. the lit of May. 1&G5, numbered
1,00(1,51 G men. It is proposed to reduce tho mili
tary establishment to a peace footing, comprehend
ing fifty thousand troops of all arms, organized
as to admit of an enlargement by filling up tho
rank to eighty two thousand six hundred, if tho
circumstances of the country rhouM require ait
augmentation of the army. The volunteer force
has already been reduced by the discharge front
service of over eight hundred thousand troops, and
the Dt par merit is proceeding rapidly in tho wort
of further reduction. The war estimitei are re
duced from tölü,-2l!),131 to $33,cll,4Cl. which
amount, in the opinion of the Department, is ade
quate for a peace establishment. The measure
of retrenchment in each U ireau and branch of th
service exhibit a diligent economy worthy of com
mendatiou. Refereuce h also made in the report
to the necessity of providing fur a uniform militU
system, and to the propriety of making suitable
provision for wounded acd" dinublcl officers aad
Eoldiers.
The revenue system of the country is a subject
of vital iutere.t to its honor and prosperity, and
should command) the earnest consideration of Con
gress. Tho Secretary of the Treasury will lay
before you a full and detailed rtport of the rscuipt
and disbursements of the last fiscal year, of tho
first qanrler of t?t present fiscal year, of the prob
able receipts and expenditures for tho oilier thrco
quarter, and the estimates for the year following
the 30th of June, 1?66. I might content myself
with a reference to that report, in which y6u will
find all the inforretijn required for your deliber
atioua and decision. P-ul tle pararrJount impor
tance of the subject so presses itself on my mind
that I ctatiot but lay before you my views of tho
measures which are reifoired for the good charac
ter, and, I might almost pay, for the existence of
this people. 'Die life of a republic lies certainly
in the energy, virtue and intelligence of its citi
zens; bat it is c-fually true that a good rcvenuei
system is tho life of an organized government. I
meet you at a time when the nation has voluntari
ly burdened itself with a debt unprecedented in
our minals. Vast as fd its amount, it fades away
into nothing when compared with the counties
blessings that will be conferred upon our country
and upon man by the preservation of the nation'
lite. Now, on the first occasion of tha meeting of
Congress since the return of peace it w of tho nt
most importance to inaugurate a jast policy, which
shall at once bo put in motion, aud which shall'
commend itself to those who come after us for it
continuance. We must aim at nothing Icm than
the complete effaeemeut of the financial evils thai
uecessarily followed a state of civil war. Vo
re uit endeavor to apply the earliest remedy to tho
deranged state of the currency, and not shrink
from devising a policy which, without being op
pressive lo tire people, shall immediatele begin to
effect a reduction of the debt, and, if persisted in
discharge it fully wilhia a definitely axed number,
of years.
It ie our first duty to prepare iu earnest for our
recovery front tine ever increasing evils of an irre
deemable currency, without a sudden revulsion;
and yet without untimely procrastination. For
that end, we must, each in our respective positions,
prepare the way. I .hold it the duty of the Exec
utive to insist upon frugality in the expenditures
and a pparing economy is itself a great national re
source. Of the banks to which authority has beert
given to issue notes secured by bonds of the United
States, we may require the greatest moderation
and prudence, and the law must be rigidly en
forced when its limits arc exceeded. We mxjt
each one of us, counsel our active and cntcfprlainz
j countrymen to be constantly on their guirdj to
liquidate debts contracted in a paper currency, ana,
by conducting business as nearly as possible on a
system of eash payments er ibort credits, to hoU
themselves prepared to return to the standard of
gold and silver. To aid our fellow-citizens io thor
prudent management of their monetary affairs, tho
duty devol ves on us to' diminish by Taw the amount
of paper money now in circulation, rive years
ago the bank-note circulation of tho country
amounted to not much more than two hundred
millions; now the circulation, bank- and national,
exceeds seven hundred millions. Tho aimplo
