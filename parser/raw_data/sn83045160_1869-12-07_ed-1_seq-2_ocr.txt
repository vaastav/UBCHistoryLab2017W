which I hoe will receive your most earn
est attention. It is a duty, and one of the
hihe-l duties of the (iovernment to se
cure to the citizens a medium of exchange
of fixe 1, unvarying valuv. This Implies
a return to a specie and no subBli-
l ute lor it can be devised. It should lo
iiinioneed now, and reai lnsl at the ear
liest practicable moment consistent with
a fair regard to the interest ol the debtor
lass. Immediate resumption, ifpracii
eable, would not be desirable; it would
OOMpel the debtor class to pay beyond
their contracts. The premium on gold at
the date of their purchase, would bring
iiiiiUruptey and ruin tothousunds. Fluc
tuations, however, in the paper values of
the measure of all values gold ia detri
mental to the interests of trade. It makes
the man of business an involuntary gam
bler; for, in all sales, when future pay
ment is to be made, both the parties spec
ulate as to what will be the value of the
currency to be paid and received.
I earnestly recommend to vou such leg
islation as will insure a gradual return to
pads payment, and put an immediate
stop to fluctuations in the value of cur
v. The methods to secure these re--uitsareas
numerous as are the specu
lators on political economy. To secure
'.he latter I see but one way, and that
is to authoriz" the treasury to redeem its
own paper at a tixed priee whenever pre
sented, nnd withhold from circulation all
such currency redeemed until sold again
for gold.
TH I PUBLIC IlKBT.
The vat rosounvs ol the nation, both
developed and uudevelojed, ought to
make our credit the best on earth, with
less burden of taxation than the citizens
have endured for six vears past. The en
tire public debt couldie paid in ten years,
but it is not desirable that the people
should Is? taxed to pay it in that time.
Year bv vear the abilitv to pay increases
i in a rapid rale, but the burden of interest
i ought to be reduced as rapidly as can be
i done without the violation of contract.
The public debt is represented, in great
part, by bonds having Irom ti . to twenty
and from ten to ion v. wars to run, bpar
Inginterest at the rate of six percent, and
rive per cent. resectively. It is optional
with the government to pay these! bonds
at any criod after the expiration of the
last time mentioned upon their Case. The
time h is already expired when a great
part of them may be taken. The time is
rapidly approaching when all may be. It
is believed tiial all which are now due
may be replaced by bonds learing a rate
of interest not exceeding 4X per cent.,
and as rapidly as the remainder becomes
dm, that they may be replaced in the
same way. To accomplish this, it may he
necessarY to atillmti.a the interest to le
paid at either of three or four of the
; money centers of Knrope, or by an assist
i:i treasurer of i he United States, at the
option of the holder of the band.

tion. Til K BBIO M.RY LOWELL.
The question of tin seizure of the brig
Mary Lowell, at one of the Bahama Is
lands, by the Spanish authorities, is now
the subject of corressndeuoe between
this government and those of Spain ami
i.reat Britain. The Captain-tJenerul of
Cuba, about May last, issued a proclama
tion authorizing search to lie made of ves
sels on the high seas. Immediate renioii
t ranee was made against this; whereupon
the Captain General issued a new procla
mation limiting the right of search of ves
sels of the L'nited States, so far as author
ized under the treaty of 17H. The proc
lamation, however," was immediately
withdrawn.
i KNTRAL AND SOCTII AMEBICAN BEPfli
i.i 's.
I have always felt that the most inti
raate relations should 1 cultivated be
tween the Itepublic of the United States
and all indeendout nations on this con
tinent. It may well lie worth considering
whether new treaties between the United
States and them may be not profitably en
tered into to secure more intimato rela
tions -friendly, commercial and other
wise. The subject of an ir ter-neeanic canal to
inins't the Atlantic and Pacific oceans
through the Isthmus of Darien, is one
which commerce is great lv interested in.
Instructions have beeu given to our iniu- I
Kier to the Republic of Colombia to en- j
deavor to obtain authority for a survey ;
by this government in order to determine j
the practicability ol sucn an unaeriaKing,
and a charter or the right ot way to bulla
by private enterprise Huch work, if the
survey proves it to be practicable.
In o'rder to comply w ith the agreement
of the United States as to a mixed com
mission at Lima for the adjustment of
claims, it became necessary to send a
commissioner to Lima, in August last.
No appropriation having been made by
Congn ss for this purKse, it is now asked
that one be made covering the past and
future expense of the commission.

dence ia herewith furnished.
NATURALIZATION.
Tho uif-ettled jxditical condition of
other countries less fortunate than our
own, sometimes induced their citizens
to come to the United States for the
sole purpose ol being naturalized. Hav
ing secured this, they return to their
native country and reside there with
out disclosing their change of allegi
ance. They occupy official osi tions,
or positions of trust, or honor, which can
only bo held by citizens of their native
land. Theyjoorney under passports de
scribing them as such citizens, ami it is
only when civil discord, after perhaps
years of quiet, threatens them, or threat
ens their persons or their property, or
when their native States draft them into
its military servioe,hat the fact of their
change of allegiance is made known; they
reside permanently from the United
States; they contribute nothing to its
revenues; they avoid the duties of its
citizenship; and they only make them
selves known by a claim of protection. I
have directed "diplomatic and consular
officers of the United States to scrutinize
carefully all such claims of protection.
The citizen of the United Slates, whether
native or adopted, who discharges his duty
to his country, is entitled to its com
plete protection. While I have a voice
in the direction of affairs, I shall
not consent to imprint the social
right by conferring it upon ficti
tious anil fraudulent claims.
PROTECTION Of EMIGRANTS.
On the accession of the present adminis
tration, it was found that the Minister for
North Germany had made propositions for
the negotiation of a convention for the pro
tection of emigrant passengers, to which
no response had been given. It was con
cluded that to be effectual all the mari
time powers engaged in the trade should
joininsuch a measure, and invitations have
been extended to the Cabinets of London,
Paris. Florence, Berlin, Brussels, The

The subject of tariif and internal taxa
tion will nicessarily receive your atten
tion. The revenues of the country are
greater than the requirements, and may
with safety lie reduced ; but as the fund
ing of the"debt in a 4 or a 4!-j per cent,
would reduce annual current expenses
largely, thus after funding, jusiilving a-4
greater reduction of taxation than would
be now expedient. I suggest a postpone

the South American Republics with

by Spain, Peru and Chili, a Congress has
been invited to be held in Washington
during the present winter.
A grant has beeu made to Europeans of
an exclusive ritrht of transit over the ter
ritory of Nicaraugua, to which Costa Kica
has given its assent, which, it is alleged,
l ontlicts w ith vested rights of citizens of
the United States. Tho Department of
State has now this subject under consid
eration. The Minister of Peru having made rep
resentation that I here was a state of war
between Peru and Spain, and that Spain
was constructing in and near New York,
thirty gun!oats, which might be used by
Spain in such a way as to relieve the
naval force at Cuba, so as co-operate
against Peru, orders were given to pre
vent their departure. No lurther steps
having been taken by the representative
of the Peruvian Government to prevent
the departure ot these vessels, and I not
feeling authorized to detain the property
of a nation with which we are at peace,
on a mere executive order, the matter has
boen referred to the Courts to decide.
The conduct of the war between the
allies and the Republic of Paraguay has
made the intercourse with that country
so difficult, that it has been deemed ad
visable to withdraw our representative
from there.

The work of restoring state Govern
ment, lo. .: to the Uniou; of protee:ing
and loa'cring fre lalior, and providing
means for paying the interest
on the puolic oaw has secunsl nuipl
is subject, I recommend the
lenient of for the present. 1 also
the renewal of the tax on in-
euuies. but at a reduced rate say of 3 per
cent., and this tax to expire in three
years, with the funding of the national
debt, as here suggested. I feel safe in
saying tho taxes and revenue from bat
ports may be reduced safely from sixty
to eighty millions per annum at
once, and still lurther reduced from
year to vear, as the resources ofthe coun
try are developed.
The refiort of the Secretary of the Treas
ury shows the receipts of the Government
for the fiscal year endinc -June :), 1H69, to
be i7n.'.J::,7L , aud the expenditures, in
cluding interest, bounties, etc., to be
&1,190.5W7. The estimates for the ensu
ing year are more favorable to the Gov
ernment, and will no doubt show a large
decrease of public debt. The receipts in i
the Treasury beyond exendit'.i!es have
exceeded the amount necessary to place
to the credit of the sinking fund, as pro
vided by law. To lock up the surplus in
tue Treasury and withhold it from circu
lation would lead to such contraction of
currency as to cripple trade, and seriously
affect the prosperity of the country. Un
der these circumstances, the Secretary of
the Treasury and myself heartily con
curred in tlie propriety of using all the
surplus currency in the Treasury, in the
purchase of Government bonds, thus re
ducing the interest-bearing debt of the
'iiiutrv, and ot submitting to Con
gress the question of the disposi
tion to be made of the bonds so
purchased. The Ixiuds now held by
the Treasury now amount to about $7o,
UOii.Oiiu, including those belonging to the
sinking fund. I recommend that the
whole i)e placed to the credit of the sink
ing fund.
Your attention is respectfully invited to
the recommendations of the Secretary ol
the Treasury for the creation of the office
of Commissioner of Customs aud Rev
enue, iitlie increase ol salary lo certain
classes of officials, and the substitution of
increased National Bank circulation to
replace the outstanding three percent,

IMPORTS AMI M VXf 'ArTCREs.
Ymir attention is respectfully called to
the law regulating the tariff on Russian
hemp, and the question whether lo fix
the charges on Russian hemp higher than
they are fixed upon Manilla, is not a vio
lation of our treaty with Russia, placing
her products upon the same footing with
those ol' the most favored nations.
Our manufactures are increasing with
wonderful rapidity under the encourage
ment which they now receive, with the
improvements in machinery already ef
fected and still increasing, causing ma
chinery to take the place of skilled labor
to a large extent. Our imports of many
articles must fall off largely within a vry
lew years. FortuniUel.v, too, manufac
tures are not confined to a few wcalities
be hoped, win
become more diffused, making the inter
est in them equal in ail sections. They
give employment and support to hun
dreds of thousands of people at home,
and retain with us tho means which other
wise would be shipped abroad. The ex
tension of railroads in Europe and the
East i - bringing into competion with our
, products like products of other coun
! tries. Self-interest, if not self-preserva-tion.
therefore dictates camion against
disturbing anv industrial interests of the
country. It teaches us also the necessity
of looking to other markets for the sale
i of our surplus.
CHINA AND JAPAN.
Our neighbors south ol the United
States, and China and Japan, should re-
: eeive our special attention. It will be
tho endeavor of theadministration to cul
tivate such relations with all these na-
i tions as to entitle us their confidence, and
make it to their iuterest, as well as ours,
to establish tietter commercial relations
; through the agency of a more enlightened
policy than that heretofore pursued to
ward" China, largely due to the sagacity
and efforts of one of our own distin
guished citizens. The world is aliout to
commence largely increased relations with
that populous and hitherto exclusive na
tion. As the United States have been in
iatory to the new policy, so they should
i be the most earnest in showing their
good faith in making it a success. In
I this connection I advise such legislation
as will forever preclude the enslavement
of the Chinese upon our soil under the
name of Coolies, and also prevent Ameri
ican vessels from engaging in the trans
portation of Coolies to any country toler
ating the system.
I also recommend that the mission to
China be raised to one of the first-class.
in all particulars that might have been
desired; yet. on i he whole, they have been
more successful than could have been
reasonably anticipated. Seven of ilie State

Simply as such ordinary claims from
which they differ more widely in tbo
gravity of their characters than in
the magnitude of tho amount. Great
even as is that difference, not a
word was found in the treaty,
and not an inference could be drawn
for it, and remove the sense of un
friendliness of tho course of Great-Britain
in our straggle for existence, which
had so deeply aud universally impressed
itself on the people of this country, Be
lieving that a convention has misconceived
in its scope, and made quite in its pro
visions, would not have produced the
hearty, cordial sentiment of pending
questions, which, alone, is consistent
with the relations which I desire to have
established between the United States
ami (ireat Britain. I regarded tiie action
ofthe Senate in rejecting the treaty to
have been evenly taken in the interest of
peace, and as a necessary step in the di
rection oi perfect and cordial friendship
between the two countries. Sensitive
people, conscious of their power, are more
at ease under a great wrong, wholly
unatoned, than under the restraint
of a settlement which satisfies nei
ther their ideas of justice nor their
grave sense of the grievance they have
sustaim-d. The rejection of the treatv
was followed by a state of public feel
ing on both sides, which I thought not
favorable to an immediate attempt at re
newed negotiations. I accordingly so in
structed the Minister of the United Slates
to Great Britain, and found that my views
in this regard were shared by Her Majes
ty's Minister. I hope that the time may
soon arrive when the two governments
esa approach the solution of the momen
tous question Willi an assurance of what
is due to the right, dignity arid honor of
each, and witli tho determination not
only to remove ;the causes of complaint
in the past, but to lay the foundation of a
bro id principal of public law which will
prevent anv future differences and tend
to firm and continued oace and friend
ship. Thisfis now the only grave question
which the 1 nited States have w
foreign nation.
THK THREE THINOS NECESSARY TO TROS
PKRITV AND IIEVKI.OPMKNT.
On mv assuming the responsibilities of
Chief Magistrate of the United States, it
was with the conviction that three things
were essential to secure prosperity and its
fullest development. First among these
is stricl integrity in fulfilling all our obli
gations. Second, to secure protection to
the person and property of the citizens of
our common country, w herever ho may
choose to move, without reference to orig
inal nationality, religion, color or politic,
demanding of him only obedience to the
laws aud iirojsr respect for the rights of
others. Third, union of all the States,
with equal rights, indestructible by
any unconstitutional moans.
To secure the first of these Congress has
taken two essential steps: First, in declar
ing by joint resolntion that the public debt
should be paid, principal and interest, in
coin. Second, by providing means for
paying. Providing the means, however,
could not seeiirnthe olijeet desired without
the proper administration of the laws for
the collection of the revenues and econ
omical disbursement of them. To this sub
ject tho Administration has most earn
estly addressed itself with results, I
lielieve, satisfactory to the country.
There has been no hesitation in changing
officials in order to secure tho efficient
execution of the law. Sometimes, loo.
ith any where, in a mere party view, undesira
ble political results wore likely to follow
It Iti IPRIM lTV
The question of the treaty
eiprocity
bet ween
and the British
continent has not been favorably consid
ered by the administration. The advan
tage of such a treaty would be wholly iu
favor of the British producers. Possibly if
we wereengaged in the trade bet ween sec
tions, citizens of the United States would
be benefitted by the reciprocity. Our in
ternal tax would prove a protection to
the British producer almost equal to the
protection which our manufactures now
receive from the tariff. Some arrange
ment, however, for the regulation of com
mercial intercourse ls-tweeji the United
States and the Dominion of Canada may
be desirable.
ANilLO-AMERIl'AN COMMISSIONS.
The Commission for adjusting the
claims of tho Hudson's Bay and Puget
Sound Agricultural Company upon the
l'nited Stales has terminated" its labors.
The award of SfiSO.blKl has been made, and
all rights and titles of the company on
the territory of the United States have
leen extinguished, aud deeds for the
property of the company received. An
appropriation by Congress to meet this
sum is asked.
The Commission for determining the
northwestern land boundary between the
United States and the British Possessions
under the treaty of MM, has completed
its labors, and the Commission has been
dissolved, in conformity with the recom- j
mendation of Congress.
A proposition was early made to the
British Government to abolish the mixed '
courts created under the treaty of April
7, 1"2, for the suppression of the slave
trade. The subject is still under nego- 1
liations.
THE FRENCn CABLE.
It having come to my knowledge that
a c. iriorate company, organized under the I
British laws, proposed to land upon the I
shores of the United States, and to oper
ate here a submarine cable under aeon- !
cession from His Majesty the Emperor of
the French, of an exclusive right for
twenty years of telegraphic commu- i
nication T-tween the shores ofi
France and the United States, with the
racy objectionable feature of subjecting
all massages conveyed thereby to the i
for anv hesitation in sustaining efficient
of re- "fficials against remonatranoes wholly po-
the United States ,,l"i,1 11 ""v l" "'cuuoii ueie
Provinces on this 'be embarrassment possible to arise from
ieaiugoii i in s . .ii u e iiiiumi ine iwuni
tennre-of-offkie ant, and to earnestly re
commend their total repeal. It could not
have been the intention of the framers of
the Constitution, when providing that
appointments made bv the President
bringing civilized settlements into contact
with all tribes of Indians. No matter what
ought to tie the relations between such,
settlements and the aborigines, the fact
is they do not harmonize well, and one or
the other has to give way in the end.
A system which looks to the extermina
tion of the race is too horrible for a nation
to adopt without entailing on itself the
wrath of all Christendom; and engender
ing tlie opinion of a disregard of human
law and the rights of others dangerous to
society. I see no sulmtitute for such a
system except iu placing all the Indians
on large reservations as soon as it can be
done, aud giving them absolute protection
there. As soon as they are fitted for it,
they should be induced to take their lands
in severalty, and to set up territorial or
ganizations for their own protection. For
full details ou this subject I call your spe
cial attention to tho reports of the Secre
tary of the Interior and the Commissioner
of Indian Affairs.
REPORT OF THB HBCRXTARr OF WAR.
The report ofthe Secretary of Warshows
the expenditures of tho War Department
for the year ending :10th of June, 18U0, to
be H0,U4,042, ot which $23,882,310 was dis
bursed in the payment of debts contracted
during the war, and is not chargeable to
current army expenses. The estimate of
$34,531,031 for the expenses of the army
for the next fiscal year is as low, it is be
lieved, as can be relied on. The estimates
of the bureau officers have been carefully
scrutinized, and reduced wherever it has
been deemed practicable. If, however,
tho condition of the country should be
such by the beginning of the next fiscal
year as to admit of a greater concentra
tion of f roups, the appropriation asked for
will not be expended. The appropriations
estimated for river and harbor improve
ments on fortifications are submitted sep
arately. Whatever amount Congress
may deem proper to appropriate for these
purposes will be expended. The recom
mendation of the General of the Army
that appropriations be made for the forts
at Boston, Portland, New, York, Philadel
phia, New Orleans and San Francisco, if
for no other, is concurred in. I also ask
your special attention to the recommend
ation of the General commanding tho mil
itary division of the Pacific tor the sale of
the Seal Islands of St. Paul and St.
George, Alaska Territory, and suggest
that it either lie complied with, or that
legislation be had for the protection ofthe
seal fisheries, from which a revenue
should be derived.
THE ARMY AND THE NAVY.
The report of the Secretary of War con
tains a synopsis of the reports of the
heads of Bureaus, of the Commanders of
Military Divisions, and of the Districts of
Virginia, Mississippi and Texas, and tho
report of the General of the Army. The
recommendations therein contained have
been well considered and submitted for
your action. I, however, call special at
tention, to the recommendation of tho
Chief of Ordnance for Ihe sale of the ar
sermls aud lands no longer of use to the
Government. Also, to the recommenda
tion of the Secretary of War that the act
of the 3d of March, 18811, prohibiting pro
motions and appoint!. I- u. s in staff corps
of the army be repealed. The extent of
tho country to be garrisoned, and the
number of military posts to lie occupied,
is the same with tho reduced army as
with a large one. The number of stall'
officers required is more dependent upon
the latter than the former considerations.
The report of the Secretary of the Navy,
accompanying this, shows the condition
of the navy when this administration
came into office, and the chauges made
since.
Strenuous efforts have been made to
place as many vessels in commission, or
render them lit for service, if required.
as soon as possible, and to substitute the
sail for steam while cruising, thus ma
terially reducing expenses of the navy
and add greatly to its efficiency. Look
ing to our future, is recommended a lib
eral though not extravagant policy to
wards this branch ofthe public service.

the IBUM,
From the-fiundation of the Government
to the present time, tin- management of tho
original inhabitants oi this continent
the Indians has been a subject of embar
rassment and expense, and has been at
tended with continuous robborios, mur
ders and wars. From mv own experience
uisin the frontiers ami in Indian coun
tries, 1 do not hold either the legislation
or the conduct of the whites, who came
most in ounlact with the ln lians, blame
less for thoso hostilities. Th past, how
ever, cannot be undone, and the question
must be met as we now Bad it. I have
attempted a new policy towards those
wards of the nation thev cannot be re
garded in any other light than as wards
with fair results, so far as tried, and which
I hope will tie attended ultimately with
great success. The Society of Friends is
well known as having succeeded in living
in peace with the Indians in the early set
tlement of Pennsylvania, while their
while neighbors ol other sections Wi re
ov reignty and the control of the French continually embroiled; they are also
jinernmeni, I cjium d the French
and British Legations at Wash
ington to be made acquainted with the
probable policy of Congress on tho subject
a . lores'ia o e 1 by the hill winch passed
Senate in March last. This drew
from the representatives of the company
an agreement to accept as the basis of
their operations the provisions 6f the bill
or of such other enactment of the subject I
as might be passed during the approach- j
also, to use their
known for their opposition to all strife
violence and war, and are generally noted
lor their strict integrit y and fair dealings.
These considerations induced me to give
the management of a few reservations of
Iudians to them, and throw the further
selection of agents upon the Society it
self. The result nas proven most satis
factory. It will be found more fully set
forth in the report ofthe Commissioner of

The report of the Postmaster General
furnishes a clear and comprehensive ex-
Dibit of the operations of tho postal ser
vice, and ofthe financial condition of this
part of the Posloffice Department. The j
ordinary postal revenues for the year end- '
ing the 30th of June, ?.. amount to
344,510, and the expenditures to ?23,t(59,- j
131, showing an excess of expenditures
over receipts of $.",3." i,0a). The excess of
expenditures over receipts for previous i
year amounted to ?i,4:rr,!)li2; the increase!
of revenues for lstiUover those of Iti8 was
jJ,(i51,9iHi, and the iucronse of expendi
tures was 4!K7,537. The increased revenue
in 1864) exceeded the increased revenue I
in 1868 by MyML and the i
increased expenditures in Is9, was
was sj,.,27,57u less than the increased ex- i
peiiditures in 1868, showing, by corapari
bob, this gratifying feature of improve
merit, that while the increase of expendi
tures over the increase of receipts in 1868 I
was J 1 ,4.W,64o, the increase of receipts
over the increase of expenditures in 186i '
was jl,U4,:i71.
Your attention is respectfully called to '
the recommendations made by the Post- !
master-General for authority to change
the rate of compensation to the main
trunk railroad lines, for their services in j
carrying the mails; for having the post
route maps executed; for reorganising
and increasingthe efficiency ol the special
agency service; for the increase of the I
mail service on tho Pacific, and for estab- I
lishinginail service under the flag of the
Union and Atlantic; and more especially j
do I call your attention to his recom
mendation for the total abolition of the
franking privilege. This is an abuse
from which no one receives a coiumensu- j
rate advantage. It reduces the receipts
for postal service from twenty-five to 1
thirty per cent., and largely in
creases lha service lo be performed. !
The method by which postage should
be paid upon public matter is set forth j
fully iu tho report of tho Postmaster
General.
HfBUp LAXDS,
Tho report of the Secretary of the
Inline. r shows that quantity of public
binds disposed of during the year end
ing 3Uth of June, 1869, was-7,666,152 acres
exceeding that of the period ending the
year by 1,010,409 acres. Of this amount,
y,H8t,litl acres were sold for cash, and
ijBfljtU acres were entered under the
Homestead laws ; the remainder was
granted Uiaid in the construcion on work
of internal improvements approved to
the States as swamp land, and located
warrants and scrip. The cash receipts
from all sources were $4,472,886 exceeding
those of the preceding year, $2,84U,14U
dining the last fiscal year; 23,lat names
wero added to the pension rolls; 4876 were
dropped therefrom, leaving at the close
WUift. The amount paid to pensioners,
including the compensation ofdisburaing
agents, was 28,422,875, an increase of
fttlJm on that of the previous vear.
PENSIONS.
The munificence of Congress has been
conspicuously manifested in its legisla
tion for the soldiers and sailors who suf
fered iu the recent struggle to maintain
that unity of government which makes
us one people. The additions to pension
rells ot ca.-ii successive year since the
conclusion of hostilities, result, in a great
degree, from the repealed amendments of
the act ofthe 14th of July, 1862, which ex
tended its provisions to cases not falling
within ,1s original scope. The large out
lay which is thus occasioned is further in
creased by the more liberal allowance be
stowed since that date upon thoso who,
in the line of duty, were wholly or per
manently disabled. Public opinion has
given an emphatic sanction to these
measures of Congress, and it will tie con
ceded that no part of our public burden
is nioro cheerfully borne than that which
is imposed by this branch of the
service. It necessitates for the
next fiscal year, in addition to
the amount just chargeable to the
naval pension fund an appropriation of
g30,00C-,000.
Mill 111 j IB tHU
During the year ending September 30,
18fi!l, the Patent Office issued 13,675 pat
ents, snd its receipts were 686,33a, being
213,920 more than the expenditures.
I would respectfully call your attention
to the recommendation of the Secretary
of the Interior, for uniting the duties of
supervising the education of freedmen
with the other duties devolving upon the
Comufissioner of Kducation.
If it is the desire of Congress to make
the census, which must bo taken during
the year 1870, more complete and perfect
than heretofore, I would suggest early
action, upon any plan that may tie agreed
on, as Congress, at its last session, ap
pointed a committee to take Into consid
er..! ion such measures as might be deemed
proper in reference to the census, and to
report a plan, i desist irom saying more,
