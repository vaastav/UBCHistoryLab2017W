was exonerated by the Coroner's hiry
nnd also by the young woman whom
he was accused of Insultincr. The evidence
showed that the men who at- |
tacked hlin gave no Intimation of their
purpose or identity, and he had naturally
assumed that they were burglars.

' Washington, I>. C.?The new ITayTauneefoto
treaty was sent to (lie Sonate.
The convention gives the I'nited
States the right to huild and protect
the canal, which shall he open without
discrimination to the commerce of
the world. It is provided that in time
of war the canal shall never he blockaded.
while the warships of tin* belligerents
shall be allowed equal rights of
transit through the waterway.
It is hot expressly provided in the
treaty that tl?o United States shall fortify
?lie canal. This means that the
navy will defend the canal. There is
no express prohibition of fortifications,
and perhaps the United States might
build forts without violating the
treaty, if forts became necessary to
preserve neutrality, hut forts are not
contemplated In the scheme, and were
not anticipated i>y the contracting nnr.
ties.
Sentiment In the Senate Is very
strong in favor of quick ratification.

day?nor indeed, did they fit l\i? own
day with any distinct lines of demarcation
between them. They glide into
toch other and it is hard to tell where
tho one quits and the other begins. We
have infants and school boys and lovers,
but very few are soldiers, and not
ono in .a hundred ever be<x>nies a justice
of the peace. His sixth age does not
do justice to our men and women of
three score years and ten. for mosi of
them grow fat instead of leaai, and our
big manly voices have not turned 10
treble. nor do they pipe and whistle in
their sound. 1 can still sing base to the

?our old peopdo die before they get to i

and with my feet upon tho top railing
of the bannisters, 1 saw them come
down in myriads as quietly and soflly
aa snowflakes and they went out as
they noared tho earth. They wore separate
and distinct as tho stars, but as
near together as tho sparks from tho
chimney of an oldtimo blacksmith
shop. Oeorge Lester was my playmate
and lived cioso by and the next morning
ho and I hunted all over his mother's
garden to find some signs of the
stars that fell, but found none. While
they were falling our negro cook. Aunt
Ailsey, was down on her knees praying,
and as she clung to my mother's
night gown she called on Jesus to coikf|
and take us all to heaven. That rr
was an epoch nnd it is worth being
