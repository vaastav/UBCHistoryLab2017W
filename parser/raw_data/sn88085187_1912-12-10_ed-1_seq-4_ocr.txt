MUTTON AND YOUR DAILY MEAT BILL
If you would cut the cost of living, abandon the pig and steer and huy
sheep.
The cheapest beef that can be bought in tho Tacoma market is the
brisket, which is pretty poor stuff, and it costs 10 cents a pound.
Good mutton for stewing ran be bought for seven cents iv local markets,
while round steak of beef costs IK cents a pound. Shoulder of pork is 18,
but shoulder of lamb is 121/., iini \ niutton is cheaper still.
Ham is 20 cents, but a leg of mutton can be secured from the butcher
for 121 o cents a pound.
All along the line mutton is cheaper than either pork or beef.
The discrepancy is due practically to the fact that the American people
have grown to be beef and pork eaters and have overlooked the nutritious
and wholesome sheep. '
The demand is for beef or pork— ami the dealers make you pay for it.
Just as they make you pay "JO cents a pound for calf's liver now which
you used to buy for five cents —a demand has been created for it by educating
the people to like it. \
In view of this the National Woo Mi rowers' association has started a
campaign to educate the people to the use of mutton. They know as soon
as the people learn to eat mutton the demand will force the price up and rais
ing sheep will become more profitable.
In the meantime the people who buy sheep now will get the benefit of
the low price.
And an epicure will tell you that for something real fine there is nothing
in the meat line from a porterhouse ro&st to a corn-fed gobbler that beats a
leg of lamb.
SAVE THE FIREMEN'S PENSION PLAN
The history of the firemen's pension fund in Tacoma would make ex
cellent reading for a jokebook.
In theory the law contemplates that a firemen's fund shall be estab
lished from which money shall be drawn to pay those who because of their
hazardous employment are injured or to compensate the families of those
who are killed. In practical operation in Tacoma tin; firemen's pension
fund has apparently been a grab bag.
Commissioner Mills thought it going a little strong yesterday when a
fireman pulled money out of the fund for a boil. But that is not as bad as
some of them. One fireman a few weeks ago put in a bill and it was actually
voted through to pay him because he cut himself in shaving.
The Times believes heartily in a pension fund for firemen, but the oper
ation of the present one in Tacoma is such that enemies of the whole sys
tem of municipal or state pensions are getting a lot of arguments to bolster
them up and give a black eye to a really meritorious scheme.
The city commission will do well to give the pension plan immediate
attention.
IN THE SPAN OF ONE LIFE
The fact is recorded that "Charles Davenport, aged 97, Inventor of
the locomotive cab and pilot and the builder of the first wrought-iron bridge
in the United States," has just died at Zoar, Ohio.
Such facts and a little reflection show what wonderful, what gigantic
strides, the world is making in an inventive and mechanical way. In that
man's lifetime have conic all the present railway locomotives, all the modern
steel structures, both bridges and buildings, for the steel buildings were
based on the steel bridge principle, and all that has come about through the
employment of those principles in mechanics. A new world has been cre
ated since the beginning of his practical activity.
And can anyone doubt that the next century will bring forth achieve
ments fully as marvelous?
After hearing that Frisco Chinese
orator recently it was a foregone con
clusion that the Commercial club here
would endorse the recognition of the
republic of China.
Once more the city commission
dodges responsibility on the testing of
Green river pipe and shifts it onto "ex
perts."
The house has passed a resolution
authorizing the appointment at a sal
ary of $60 per month of a messenger to
the committee on the disposition of
useless papers. This does not include
President Taft's messages.
Manchurian Chinese have taken to
wearing canes and tight shoes. The
march of civilization is just spoiling
some mighty fine heathen.

Hominy and Honey Is
Poets Health Secret
OAKLAND, Cal., Dec. 10. —
Hominy and honey may once more
be regarded -as something good
to eat. Joaquin Miller, the Cali
fornia poet, has made the dis
covery. I'pon the homely diet of
his forefathers he has entirely re
covered from his recent illness
and at the age of 75 years has
undertaken what he considers tho
greatest poem he has ever work
ed upon.
Friends of the venerable bard
have been surprised by his recent
demonstrations of good health.
Recently ho appeared at a thea
ter and lectured on his poem,
"Columbus." He introduced Mrs.
Gertrude Atherton at a demo
cratic rally in Oakland and again
he was the guest of honor at a
school fete.
The explanation 'has come In
the announcement of his daugh
ter, Juanita, that his diet for the
past year has been restricted to
hominy and honey. She says that
If An Angleworm Can Think,
Can a Goldfish Warble? Sure!
If you have got a gold-fish in
your home teach him to sing!
If you have a gentle cat with
a white spot over his left eye,

Nonsense?
Not at all, Helene, not at all.
According to news dispatches
received by the Times today,, a
Harvard professor has just dis
covered that angle-worms think
and remember.
An angle or fish worm will al
ways crawl out of a lighted place
into a dark one. Knowing this,
Professor Yerkes put the angle
worm which he was experiment
ing upon into a glass dish in
which were two dark holes.
