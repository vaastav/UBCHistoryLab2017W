BUSINESS REVIEW.
Last Sunday's AL"sor contains
a complete and lengthy review of
the business of New Orleans for the,
ipast fteen months, from Septem
ber 1, 1877, to Ddcember 1, 1878.
There has been a !ar&e falli>.. off
jin the receipts of cotton for the ±
first qparter of the present commel- 1
ciad yeir, the receipts being 160,257
bales, whereas las: year 224,027
bales had been received during the
same tinuea This is largely due to
the fact that the prevalence of yel.
low fever eamnsed much of the cotton
to seek inland routes to the East for
shipment, which would otherwise
have come to New Orlesans. Owing
;o the same cause the stock on hand
September 1, this year, was only
'4086 bales, compared with 21,856
bales at that datrlast year. The
groos reoeipta up to August 31 of
tWe present year, however, show an
increase of son.e 300,000 bales over
last year. Taking Middling cotton
as a basis the price has rued lower
this yeas than it did in 1877, with
the exteption of the month of,
August, when it was a little higher,
.teing quoted at 11 3-16c., against
j for the same month last year.
The sceits of sugar from the 1st i
of September, 1878, up to the 1st
1of December, show a decided in.
crease, being 4725 hogsheads and
i 4lbarrels, against 1670 hogsheads
entd 2160 barrels for the same time1
last year. The receipts up the 1st
of September, 1878, were 125,100
L hogsheads, against 169,331 hogs
heads in 1877, showing a decrease
this year of 44,231 hogsheads.
Molasses, rice and wool show an
increase over last year.
Notwithstanding the damaging
effects of the epidemic, business for
the past three months has been
gradually improving, and with good
crops and a healthy season, New
Orleans will doubtless recover much
of her lost trade and regain her
ant beiluma prosperity, enabling her
to maintain her social standing as
the "Queen City of the South."

When a young man comes to be
lieve that a glass of liquor is a daily
necessity, he must soon quit diunk
iug and attend to bu"inesa, or quit
business and attend to drinking.-
_icawne.
If he has no business to attend to
and nothing to drink, he can kill
time and go to "'court."
Mr. Wood, of Pennsylvania, pre
sented a resolution is the House to
abolish the tax on matches. This
should not be put upon the shelf.
We hope they will not strike out
any portion nor make light of it.
It is of matchless importance.
Says the Cincinnati Price Cur
rent: Only one person in ten, as
shown by the record, that take out
a life policy, continues it to matur
ity. Men procare life insurance as
a necessity. They soon find that
its cost puts it in the list of high
priced luxuries, and they have to
discontinue. T he fault is in the re
serve system. which is beginning to
be understood, and which, as it is
being understood, is being aban
doned. In life insurance, the best
way is to pay as you io.
A SOLID SOUT H.
It is but natural, perhaps, that
the party in power should resort to
every conceivable plan for the pur
gose of enabling -them to retain
their position. WSiI when, for the
accomplishment of 'this object, theyi
resort to vile :'a:%s-sions and most!
base misrepreaentations of the con
dition of affairs in the South, on the
very doubtful theory that all is fair I
in politics, it remains jor uis t
meet them at every point aetl refute
thair numitigated slanders. Tlerm
are.influential and able journals in
the North who come bravely to our
assistance in doing this. We will
mention the Boston Globe as one
which seems to thoroughly under
stand and appreciate the situation.
It says: "What is the cry about
now? It is not even alleged that
the negro is not paid for his labor.
It is not charged that the negro is
chbeated in business affairs. It is
not claimed that his rights of prop
erty are infringed. It is not assert
1ed that he does not get his own.
_The indictment is that he doesn't
I vote the Republican ticket, as Re
publicans think he ought. 'Only
this and nothing more.' It is not
the happiness of the colorid man,
but the happiness of the Repub
lican party that is disturbed. The
black man votes with his friends,
with the men that give him employ
ment and pay him, or, attending to
his humble business, he does not
vote at all, and the Republicans in
the North think that there has been
a great outrage. This as a large
fraction of the Southern question.
The negro only asks to be let alone
to earn his bread lor his wife and
children. It is chiefly Republicas
who want his vote that will not let
him alone. It is not the negro in
the South who tiomplains of belig
robbed of his rights; it is the Re-i
publican politicians in the North.
IThe colored people have all the .
rights which the ballot was given
them to secure. If the country were
to wait for them to enter complaint,
there would be no sectional ques
tion in our polities at all.
Gen. Siegfried, of Pennsylvania,
