S1AATO!! VACi: AND TIIK I'ltO
PitlKTlKS OF SPEECH.
Two weeks ago, in commenting upon
Senator Vance's excellent lecture on
"North Carolina," delivered in Hender
son, the Chkonu lk took occasion to ex
press the hope that in the future, under
no circumstances, would this distinguished
speaker violate the proprieties of speech
by saying anything "to which a refined
lady could object."" Some of the friends of
the Senator think that our language could
be construed into meaning that it had
been the Senator's custom heretofore to
relate vulgar anecdotes and make im
proper intimations to an audience when
ladies were present. After the estimate
w e placed upon the speaker we are surpris
ed at such const ruction. It was far from
our purpose to intimate that the Senator
had been guilty of so grossly insulting the
good women of North Carolina, who go in
larger numbers to hear him speak than to
hear any other North Carolinian. The
meaning that the legitimate construction
of our words conveyed was, that Senator
Vance has the unsavory reputation of
telling "smutty" jokes, and that he made
so interesting and able a lecture when he
said nothing "to which the most re
lined lady could object," it was to be
hoped that in every speech, whether be
fore a polite audience with a literary
theme, or before the masses on the hust
ings, he would let his Henderson lecture
be an earnes of all his future addresses
and speeches. There is no questioning the
fact that in political speeches Senator
Vance does amuse the boys by relating an
ecdotes which he would not like fora lady
to hear. In his younger days, especially
when he was canvassing his district for
Congress, this was more true of him than
it is to-day, or has been since he was
elected Governor in 1S76. There has been
marked improved in this line, and yet we
hate to know that there has not been an
entire abandonment of the habit which
detracts so much from our great Senator.
The greatest harm that has come from
the relation of these jokes ar l anecdotes
by the Senator, is the impression it makes
upon ambitious young men. They hear
him and they remember that people laugh
ed at his "broad" humor, not stopping to
retleet that the fun was used to drive home
a strong point of the speech. Men of small
calibre, who could not be compared to him
in point of ability, have imitated his vice
in that particular and have treated their
hearers to a recital of dirty and . bscene
joh.es, wiucu uoverncr Vance w heard
or uttered, claiming them to be !hj b,-j.v
tor's jokes. Senator Vance never tells a
joke in a speech which is not illustrative
of some argument or statement he is mak
ing; his pretended imitators revel in the
nastiness of obscenity for the love of it
and nauseate all decent people, and when
reproved, point to something Gov. Vance
has said as a defense. Although he ou"-ht
not to be held responsible for what these
men say, so great in his influence that he
ought to be criticized for giviHg them the
.slightest ground for claiming him as the
great apostle of "broad" humor, and
1 'smutty" anecdotes. There was excuse
for it when he was a younger man; to-day
"full of honors" such a habit is highly
censurable, and we are glad to know that
it is seldom is these late years that the
Senator so far forgets the proprieties of
speech as to make any statement anywhere,
to any audience "which a refined lady
ourht not to hear.'
The Chronicle takes the high ground
that a man has no right at any time to re
late "smutty"1 anecdotes or tell vulgar
jokes, or jokes that admit a vulgT con
struction, and it thinks Senator Vance
unquestionably the greatest Carolinian
does great harm whenever he relates any
thing of that kind. We have never heard
him violate the proprieties of speech when
ladies were present; we hope Ix-cause he
is too good and great and useful and in
fluential a man never to aLrain hear that
he has done so when none hut men
were present.
SMALL IMJUSTKIKS.
The great reason Eastern North Caro
lina towns keep poor and do not improve
as rapidly as tobacco towns is found in the
fact that all the residents are dependent
upon what is made in the place and county.
No money comes into the town from a dis
tance. Everything has to come-out of the
ground and of course when there is no
money coming in from other places there
can be no real prosperity. Property may,
and does change hands, but that doesn't
help a place. There is no increase of val
ue imparted by the change. There will lie
no substantial prosperity in Eastern Caro
lina until manufactories are started. There
is no need of fifty or a hundred thousand
dollars to start enterprises of this kind.
The making of chairs, desks, clothes pins,
rolling pins, wooden buckets, tin ware of
all kinds, willow ware and many other
things that are in demand everywhere
could be made profitably in the State.
Suppose three men in Goldsboro were to
invest $1,000 - each and go into the
manufacture of clothespins, a very simple
little article that is used the world over.
Why couldn't they make it pay hand
somely ?
If five men in Wilson would invest $1,-
000 each and set up a place to make noth
ing but roiling pins did you ever think
that there is not a kitchen in North Caro
lina that has not a rolling pin ? they
would be surprised at their success.
In Kaleigh, on little capital, companies
might be formed to manufacture the desks
used in schools w hich we now buy at the
North, for making rules which every book
keeper must have, for making willow bas
kets, for making tops thousands are sold
every year in the State.
Suppose Tarboro would invest $o,000 in
making wooden plates and wooden buck
ets. The investment would pay well there,
as it has in New Berne.
It is foolish for people in North Caro
lina to sit down with folded hands because
they have not enough capital to build a
hundred Corliss er. . or turn out a
million yards of cloth i day.
Connecticut is dotted with little facto
ries making every conceivable article of
use which we call "Yankee notions." We
ought to m.ske these things in the State,
keep our money at home and ship our
manufactured articles elsewhere to bring in
surplus money money that has not come
out of the home people. We must first crawl.
We must not despise the day of small
things if we would make ourselves rich
and prospersous. If we start small indus
tries large ones will certainly follow in
course of time.
THE PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE.
Mr. Cleveland's message, extracts of the
most important parts of which will be
found in to-day's Chronicle, is the first
message to Congress from a Democratic
President in twenty-five years. Two
thirds of the readers of this paper are un
der forty years old and have never seen,
much less read, a Democratic message. It
is a long document would fill nearly
two pages of the Chronicle and we
dare say the entire text will be read by
few people, comparatively speaking. And
yet, after waiting and hoping all the long
years, which reached a quarter of a cen
tury, for a Democratic President, every
follower of Jefferson ought to have enough
of loyalty to wade through it, figures,
treaties and foreign relations included.
However, if what appears in this issue of
the Chronicle is read and endorsed, Dem
ocracy will be strengthened and a love of
it-form inculcated.
It is the message of a statesman of the
greatest man who has occupied the Presi
dential chair in half a century, and is an
epitome of the public matters affecting the
people of the United States. It is preg
nant with wise and practical suggestions.
Read it.
The fact that this is the first message
of a Democratic President in a quarter of
a century, is significant of the fact that
a new generation is at the helm, and that
the issues which the war raised and which
some leaders have clung to with wonder
ful tenacity, have passed away. The
great mass of voters are under forty
men who were not responsible for the war
and who have not the feelings which nat
urally influence the participants. Look
ing back with admiration upon the past,
with its great men and great achievements,
the new generation has set its face to the
morning, and will not longer be controll
ed by dead issues. Following Mr. Cleve
land, who does not refer to the South at
all other than he does to the other geo
graphical divisions of the country, the
Jeffersonian Democracy will fight its bat
tles henceforth on administrative reforms
and constitutional liberty.
SENATOR JOHN W. DANIEL..
There is general rejoicing over the nom
ination of Hon. John W. Daniel, by the
I ei;iocratic caucus of the Virginia legisla
ture, to succeed Wm. Mahone in the U.
S. Senate. The contest had been a spirit
ed one between Mr. Daniel and Hon. John
S. Barbour, chairman of the State Demo
cratic Executive Committee. The vote
stood Daniel 65, Barbour 31 . The nom
ination is equivalent to an election, and
secures the retirement (let us give thanks)
of Mahone from public life.
Mr. Daniel is recognized as the greatest
orator in the South, if not in the country.
His address on the unveilingof the statues
of both Lee and Washington were models,
whether we speak of the composition or
delivery, and won for him a reputation
not bound by State lines. Not only is he
a great orator, but what li worth more
in the United States Senate, he is an in
dustrious lawyer and a hard student.
The Old Dominion will once more be
represented bv a man who is the
l -r of
anv man in theS-nate, and having thrown
off the yoke of Mahoneisrn, will regain its
proper position among the Mate- of the
Union.
Referring to the contest between Messrs.
Daniel and Harbour the State .- ys: "Eith
er of these gentlemen, it was felt by the
Ilenu.i-!-:its of The !st;ite. COU.d aolV Tepie-
.-ent this historic Commonwealth in thi
l,;,r'....t ,...,,r . .I of tti, i-.iiiulrv. and it is as
stnking as it is gratifying that the cont-'-t
has been marked throughout by the dig
nity, fairness and mainly bearing o t.i-
contestants. i heirs was a IrienUiy ana
an honorably rivalry, and neither tney nor
their friends have resorted in any manm r
to the unbecoming tactics that have too
often been practiced by aspirants for such
honors in other parts of the country.
Each of these distinguished gentlemen re
tires from the contest with character as
unspotted as when he entered it. What
reflection could be more satisfactory to the
advocates of pure and uncontaminatel
politics?"
TIIK (.KKAT ClVILIZKR.
While much is said everywhere about
the civilizing and refining effects of edu
cation, and while culture is. in some places,
recommended as a substitute for religion,
or as in itself a religion, the Chroniclk is
persuaded that the faithful preaching of
the gospel has been and still is the great
civilizer of mankind. The earnest and elo
quent preacher eloquent because his
heart is all aglow with the desire to spread
far and wide the gospel, which, he feels,
has dignified his own life with a lofty pur
pose and warmed his own heart with a fire
not of this earth, goes forth into the high
ways and hedges and, where ignorance
and vice reigned supreme, knowledge and
virtue comes. He sows the seed of truth,
the IToly Spirit enlightens the understand
ings that were dark and gospel morality
lays the foundation of christian civiliza
tion. Light produces the desire for more
light, schools are established, the little
children are taught to read, and here and
there, may be seen a grey head bending
studiously under the effort of learning let
ter by letter the scriptures until he can
read for himself the story of salvation.
Progress is made. The rude arts and sciences
gradually make their appearance. New
wants spring up and inventive genius is
brought into play to supply them. Labor
has at last been properly directed, is made
profitable these are sure accumulations
of the result of labor. Leisure becomes
possible and culture and refinement and
progress in the arts, and advancement in
the sciences move on apace.
God speed the earnest backwoods preach
er, however ignorant he may be, if only
he knows the way of salvation. Give him
his true title; name him pioneer of civili
zation as well as vanguard of Christianity.
Truly his feet are beautiful upon the
mountains and the desolate places rejoice
at the sound of his footsteps.
It is well that the Board of Agriculture
took a month to investigate before estab
lishing the Industrial School. Our obser
vation has been that the more a man learns
about these schools the more he favors
their establishment. If the members of
the Board are thorough in their investiga
tion there is no question about their ac
tion when they meet in January. The
people don't hesitate to say that the school
ought to be established if it is necessary
to reduce the present force at the Depart
ment, and cut down the salaries of some
of the others. The school, with the ex
ception of the analysis of fertilizers,
would be worth more than all the other
work now done.
It is noteworthly in this day when there
is a contest over most wills that the two
great Democrats, Gen. McClellan .and
Vice-President Hendricks, who have re
cently "fallen on sleep," left their entire
estates to their wives . This speaks strong
ly and eloquently of the domestic happi
ness of these two great men. Like many
other men who have attained eminence
there was always a cheerful and happy
home life that gave inspiration, that
caused them to hope, and gave them real
solace when not occupied with public du
ties. How many men have been thus aid
ed by a good wife and happy home!
When Mr. Carlisle was elected Speaker
of the House last year it was regarded as
a victory for the advocates of tariff reduc
tion. There was general rejoicing among
all tariff reformers at his election. But,
thanks(?) to Mr. Samuel J. Randall, no re
form was effected. This year Mr. Carlisle
was nominated unanimously by the Demo
cratic caucus without any reference to the
tariff agitation. He is regarded even by
Republicans as a fair and impartial officer,
and is the known enemy of jobbers and
lobyists. He worthily fills the chair which
Nat Macon and James K. Polk honored.
The Spirit of the Age and the N. C.
Presbyterian oppose the movement set on
foot recently to establish a prohibition
party in North Carolina. The Chronicle
commends them for their wise counsel.
We need no prohibition party. Whenever
the people in North Carolina are m favor
of a prohibition of the liquor traffic they
can get it through the Democratic party,
which in this State has always retrained
from passing a law over the heads of the
people, but haslet the voice of the people
determin such questions.
We are glad to know that the depart
ment of Pelagogics at the University is
doing well, there are twenty-live takn g
the course, the interest is good, and the
future is full of hope in connection with
the new department. Prof. Henry is a
good worker and a conscientious teacher,
and all friends of education will give him
their aid in building up this new course at
the University.
The election by the Republicans of Sen
ator John Sherman to be President pro
tempore, of the Senate, makes the possi
bility of the President's death, a serious
matter. What if Sherman should become
President? While he is a better financier,
a finer scholar, and more experienced par
liamentarian, we much prefer John A.
Logan, if he does spell heaven without
an a.
The Chronicle is pleased to note that
Judge Daniel G. Fowle and Walter R.
Henry, Esq., have formed a partnership
for the practice of lawT at Henderson. Mr.
Henry is succeeding finely at Hendeeson,
we are glad to hear, and a partnership
with Judge Fowle will tend to increase his
already large practice. Judge Fowle will
attend all Vance courts.

You will be sustained by the honest and

A prominent Pender county farmer and
merchant known everywhere in Eastern
North Carolina, is kind enough to to say
in a recent letter: "The Chronicle is a
good paper one of the best in the State
and gets better every week. I am glad to
see that you keep out all scandals 1 think

per. Writing up the business of the towns
is a good feature, as its gives one an idea
of the different sections of the State, so
that if a man wants to change his location
he knows the advantages the several places
offer."
GROWING IN LIBERALITY.
The Work of Keeping the Democracy Ad
vancing to be Kept Hp by Young Men.
To The Chronicle: We are growing in
liberality. I mean by "we" the people of
this great land without regard to party or
section or residence; and this is proof of it:
Such a Republican newspaper as the New
York Times has, by implication at least,
advised the election of a Democratic Sen
ator as President pro tempore of the Sen
ate. Of course no such thing will be done.
The Senate has a clear Republican major
ity of o, and a Republican will succeed the
dead Vice-President, most likely Senator
Sherman. But if a Democrat was elected,
the polities of the Administration would
not be changed if the President were to
die; and thus the will of the people as ex
pressed at thejolls hist year would be car
ried out. It would be a generous and
proper thing for the Republicans in the
Senate to do. But they can hardly be
blamed for not doing it. It is not the na
ture of political parties to throw away
even an advantage that they get by acci
dent. Then there are two precedents for
electing a Republican. When Wm. R.
King, of Alabama, was elected to succeed
Filmore when Filmore succeeded Taylor,
the Democrats took advantage of their
majority in the Senate to make a possible
change of polities in the Administration.
So that if the Republicans refuse to be
generous in such a refusal they will only
be following a Democratic precedent. But
the point I make is this - that there are
Republicans, and among them the greatest
and fairest and most able of the great Re
publican papers, who are willing to be
generous and to grant that party measures
ought to be set aside in deference to the
will of the people. This was not so five
years ago. We are becoming broader and
more liberal.
The death of the Vice-President is the
removal of the most active of all the older
Democratic leaders from the stage, if not
from life. Mr. Tilden is in permanent re
tirement. Although he has out lived many
of his enemies who years ago were sure
that he was ready for the grave and may
outlive many more of them, he will never
again come before the people. If there
were no other reason, he does now really
like the physical strength to undertake any
serious work, to say nothing of a campaign
and the burdens of a public office. He
spends most of his time reading. He does
not weary his failing eyesight by reading
himself, but his secretaries are nearly al
ways beside him reading to him. Horatio
Seymour, on his farm, is a dying old man.
His intellect is not dimmed, but his death
from old age would surprise nobody at any
day. Ex-Senator Thurman is not as weal
as Mr. Tilden or Mr. Seymour but he is an
old man and is hardly likely again to enter
public life. Bayard is yet young enough
to be vigorous; but of the company of old
leaders who during all these years since
the war have been the great men of the
Democratic party, he is almost the only
one whose period of activity is not gone.
The work they did in keeping the party in
shape and keeping its column advancing
must bo continued by younger men. Of
all the younger men the greatest is at the
helm now. Assassins keeping off, and
good luck attending him, Grover Cleve
land has promise of years and strength
and opportunity, and he has the power
and the capacity in the fullest measure to
be such a leader for the second great pe
riod of the Democracy as Jefferson was
of the first. He is yet really in his youth.
Contemporaneous with Hendricks and
Thurman and Tilden and Seymour aud the
other great Democrats were Edmunds and
Blaine and Conkling and a number who
are now gone Morton, Garfield, ("rant,
Carpenter. These were the real forces in
Republican politics during the years when
this noble old school of Democrats was
keeping Democratic principles alive: and
the most of them, too, are either dead in
flesh or in politics. Edmunds is yet in the
Senate and he is not yet feeble; but Conk
ling and Blaine, young as they are in com
parison with some of the rest, are out of
politics, most likely forever. There are
left younger men of whom Senator Ingails
from Kansas is perhaps the sharpest blade
of all.
A new crowd is coming on the scene in
both -parties, aud we are going to have
new battles to fight ,riud new ideas to fight
for and agaiust. Take your measureof
men in any honest fashio'n, of any party,
who are now in public life; and the vigor
ous man now in the White House is in
breadth and height the greatest of them
all. The present outlook is, if we follow
where he leads, we shall have both agreater
Democratic party than the world ever be
fore saw and the surest title to its suprem
acy and the best chance of its benefits.

ed to a position iu the Revenue Depart
ment at a salary of $1 a day. He has
friends in every county in the State who
will be glad to hear that lightning has
struck his big form.

The Chronicle was pk-a,-ed to have a
call Tuesday from W. L. Thorp, Esq., of
Nash, who brought his tobacco to soli in
the Farmers' Warehouse. Mr. Thorp was
atone time editor of the Rocky Mount
Mail. He has been elevated to the posi
tion of an independent farmer.
Rev. Ed. M. Poteat, pastor of the Bap
tist church at Chapel Hill, has accepted
the assistant Professorship of languages
in Wake Forest College. The Chronicle
congratulates Wake Forest on so valuable
au acquisition to the facility, and condoles
with the Chapel Hill Baptists on the lo. -of
a faithful pastor.
When the members of the U. S. I louse
were drawing for seats Monday, Mr. Mills,
of Texas, asked unanimous consent that
Mr. Kelley, of Pennsylvania, the "father
of the House," be permitted to choose his
scat in advance, but Mr. Bennett, of North
Carolina, objected. The seat was given
him notwithstanding the objection.
A friend calls our attention to the fact
that in the list of Conference appointments
we omitted to state that Rev. John R.
Brooks was returned to Wilson. We hasten
to make the correction and say that ac
cording to our belief there is no more ef
ficient preacher in the Conference than
Mr. Brooks, and no better people, to serve
than the Wilson people.
Rev. Dr. J. B. Robbitt will shortly move
to Maryland, having been transferred at
his request, by the M. E. Conference at its
recent session. The board of stewards of
Cary circuit, which he has served two
years, passed highly complimentary reso
lutions. He was for a number of years
editor of the Christian Advocate, and
from its publication, made money.
Miss Mamie Hatchet, editress of the
Sout hern Woman, published at Henderson,
N. C, is in Raleigh this week in the inter
est of her paper. In this connection the
Chronicle is pleased to note that Miss
Hatchet, when solicited to become a mem
ber of the Woman's Suffrage Association,
emphatically declined, saying that sin
could not conscientiously become a mem
ber of the organization that public opin
ion has not been educated to it, and that
she believes with our mixed population
woman suffrage would be a curse.
THE NEGRO IN POLITICS.
To The Chronicle: The negro in New
Y'ork is in a stew. There is a colored or
gan here, and a very creditable newspaper
it is, too, of abo d 5,000 circulation. It
has brains in it, and you would find it in
teresting. I went to the office once, and
saw negro boys and girls setting type and
two very gentlemenly and well informed
colored men in the editorial office. They
write well and talk well and bear the rep
utation of men of excellent character ami
influence. In the society columns are no
tices of parties and balls and literary soci
eties and fashionable weddings and all
sorts of "events" done up in a style that
only the Wilson Mirror could approach in
felicity. But the stew that the negro is
in at present is political. The editor is- an
independent fellow whom you can't help
admiring, lb- was a Republican for a long
time, and yet has a leaning in that way.
But he is now giving the New York politi
cal manager "green goss." The negro in
New York he goes on to say (and he keeps
saying it) has been a good citizen; has
generally been a good Republican; has in
ever- way done his duty to society ami to
the Republican party to the extent of his
ability and opportunity; and so he has.
But the political managers have never had
the decency to "recognize" him or to do
him the first favor. Isn't it lime, the pa
per, asks that colored men in New York-
were looking out for themselves and let- i
ling go the horns of the Republican altar j
But on the other hand, the Democrats are '
making no promises or giving any bait to i
catch them, and there is no chance so far
as he can see, that the Democrats in New '
York will do any better than the Kepubli-
cans have done. This is all true as gospel. ;
Now comes the point: This negro editor
sees the folly of "plaving nigger" that i
is, oj. oeing a separate oouy or Class m
politics and advises his readers to expect
nothing simply on the ground that theV
are colored men, but to go on as American
citizens, belonging to whatever par'v they
think is right precisely as they buy gr
eeries from whatever grocer they please
or work for whatever employe r treats them
best. This is the true philosoohv. I,.n"r
Vw o i.imro,-- .,t oil. v. ' i. ..
uip.v l. ct- nn. i l lUrtill. It MYITIS
to me that it applies as well in North Car
olina as iu New York. The Chronicle has
the compliment paid it (it always seemed
to me a compliment because it showed a
trust in the Chronicle's fairness) to have
a number of negro subscribers. They
know, no doubt, more about the papers
edited by members of their race than I
know; but it s.-ems to me they all ought to
lead some such well edited colored paper
as the New York Freeman. There is, by
the way, a negro boy employed as one of
the clerks in the counting room of the
Evening Post. "V7. II. P
