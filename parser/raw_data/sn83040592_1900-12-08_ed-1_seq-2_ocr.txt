Washington, Dec. 3. The following
I given as a brief review of President
McKinley' annual rutsshge to the two
house of congresst
The Chinese Crisis.
The president fives first place In hts
message to the troubles In China, and
our connection with the allied forces op
erating there, lie reviews the causes
leading up to the tloxer outbresk, and
the llrst murders of foreigners in Chi
here territories. In this connection h
says:
The Increasing gravity of the conditions
In China and the imminence of Derll to our
own diversified Interests In the empire, as
well as to those of all the other treaty gov.
trnments, were soon appreciated by this
fovernment. causing; It profound solicitude,

abiding cltlsens snd for the exercise of
their benellcent callings among the Chinese
people.
aitndrul or tnli, it wss felt to ne appro
nrlatft that nur mirnnaee should be nro-
nounced in favor of such course as would
hasten united action of the powers at Pe
king to promote the administrative reforms
so greatly needed for strengthening the
Imperial government and maintaining the
Intca-rltv of China, in which we believed the
whole western a-nrlit to he alike concerned.
To three ends I caused to be addressed to
the several powers occupying territory snd
maintaining spheres of Influence in China
ne circular proposals or ikw, invmne
from them declarations of their Intentions
and viewa aa to the desirability of the
adoption of measures Insuring the benefits
of equality of treatment of all foreign
trsde throuchout Chins.
The hlHtorv of the efforts made st
Kevins the beleaguered leaatloners In Pe
king Is thoroughly covered.
During the slme. says the president, tne
defenders lost liS killed. 135 wounded and
seven by disease the Inst all children
Continuing he says: Not only are the pro
testations of the Chinese government that
it protrctea ana succored the legations
positively contrsdlcted, but Irresistible
prouf accumulates that the attacks upon

;irly uniformed, armed and officered, be
longing to the command of Jung Lu, the
imperial commander in chief. Decrees en
couraging the Iloxers. orcsnlslng them un
dcr prominent imperial officers, provision
ing them, snd even granting them large
sums in the name of the empress dowsger,
are known to exist. Members of the
tsung-ll-yamen who counseled protection
of the foreigners were beheaded. Even in
the distant provinces men susjweted of for
eign sympatny were put to tiestn, promi
nent among these being Chang Yen-Hoon,

Tie recalls the circular note to the now-
era irsuea oy mis government on juiy s,

guaranteeing the integrity of China, and
says:
As wos then said, "the policy of the
government of the I'nlted States Is to
seek a solution which may bring about
permanent safety and peaco to China,
fircserve i.mnese territorial ana aamin
tratlve entity, protect all rishta ur
a meed to friendly powers by trenty and
International law, and safeguard for th
world the principle of equal and Impar
tial trade with all parts of the Chines
empire.
Candltloas of Peace.
A tittle further on the nrrslrirnt aava
f regard as one nf the essential factors of
a durable adjustment the securement of
adequate guarantees ror liberty or fslth,
since insecurity of those natives who may
embrace alien creeds Is a scarcely less ef
fectual assault unon the rishta of foreign
worship and teaching than would be the
uireci invasion tnrreoi.
The matter of Indemnity for our wronged
rltisens Is a question of grave concern.
Measured In money alone, a sufficient
reparation may prove to be beyond the
ability of China to meet. All the powers
concur In emphstlc disclaimers of any pur
pose of aggrandisement through the dis
memberment of the empire. I am disposed
to think that due compensation may be
made in pert by Increased guarantees of
wcuniy gar loreign rignts ana immuni
ties, and, most Important of all, by the
opening of China to the equal commerce of
all the world. These views have been and
will be earnestly advocated by our repre
sentatives.
First Place at Paris.
Our relations with other countries are

nity for a display of the good will ex

A criterion of the extent and success

Of our relations with Germany the nrea.
Ident says good will prevails, of the meat
inspection law ot i.ermnny ne ruys:
An Imnerial meat insnectlon law haa
been enacted for Germany. While it may
simplify the Inspection, It prohibits cer
tain products heretofore sdmitted. There
Is still great uncertainty a.t to whether
our well-nigh extinguished German trade
In meat products can revive under Its
new burdens. Much will depend upon
regulations not yet promulgated, which
we confidently hope will be free from
the discriminations which attended the
enforcement of th old statutes.

The War la Sooth Africa.
A review of th Incident connected

this connection vexatious questions a roe

to neutral cargoes, not contraband In
their own nature, shluoed to ForiuiuMa
Smith Africa, on the score of probable or
auspecled ultimate destination to the Boer

our part resulted In the Brit In h govern

goods shown to be actual property of Amer

the satisfaction of the immediately Inter
ested parties, although, unfortunately,
without a broad settlement of the question
of a neutral's right to send goods not
contrsbsnd oer se to a neutral nart ad
jacent to a belligerent area.
Relatione with Italy.
The lynching of the Italians In Louisi
ana Is the one question standing between
this government and Italy. That coun
try la still waiting lor tho punishment of
the parties guilty ui mat crime, bucccssivc

Spain' claim to a number of the 1st
lands Inthe Philippine group not covered
by. th Part treaty he saya:
By th term of th treaty of peace
th line bounding th ceded Philippine
group In the southweat failed to Include
several small lalands lying west of th
Bulus, which have always been recog
nised as under Bosnian control. The oc
cupation of Blbutu and Cagayan Bulu by
ur naval forces elicited a claim on the
part of Spain, the essential equity of
which could not be gainsaid. In order to
cure th defect of the treaty by remov
ing all possible ground of future mis
Understanding respecting the Interpret!,
lion of It third artlclo, I directed the
negotiation Of a supplementary treaty,
which 'will be forthwith laid before the
senate, whereby Spain Quits sil title and
claim to the Islands named. well as to
ny and all Islands belonging to the Phil
ippine archipelago lying outside the
lines ascribed In said third article, and
agrees that all such islsnds shall be com
prehended In the cession of the archi
pelago a fully as If they had been ex
pressly Included within those lines. In
consideration of this cession the United
Btntes la to pay to Spain the sum of
$100,000.
Oar Claims Against Tar-key.
Our claims unon the government of the
sultan for reparation for injuries suffered
by Americsn cltlsens In Armenia and else
where give promise of early and satisfac
tory settlement. His majesty's good dispo
sition In this regard has been evidenced ny
the Issuance of an Irade for rebuilding th
American college at narpoot.
Weald Extead Reciprocity.
H urges the approval of th commer
cial convention entered Into between
thla government and other power as
soon aa possible that the agricultural and
other industries of the country may proltt
thereby. Continuing on thla subject h
ays:
Th policy of reciprocity so msnlfestly
reds upon th principles of International
equity snd has been so renestedly sp
proved by the people of the I'nlted States,
that there ought to be no hesitation In
either branch of th congress In giving
to It full effect.
Exposltloa at BenTalo.
The exposition of the resources and
Kroducts of the western hemisphere to be
eld at IlulTnlo next year promises Impor
tsnt results not only for the United States
but for the other participating countries.
It Is gratifying that the Latin-American
states have evinced the liveliest Interest,
and th fact that an international Ameri
can congress will be held In the City of
Mexico while the exposition Is In progress
encourage th hope of larger dlsplsy at
Ruffaln ihan mla-hi otherwise be nrsctlc-
able. The work of preparing an exhibit of
our national resources Is making satisfac
tory progress under the direction of dif
ferent officials of the federal government,
and the various states of the union hsv
shown a disposition toward the moat lib
eral participation In th enterprise.
Oar Financial Showing:.
The president points with much prlda
to the showing made by the treasury de
partment and quotes exhaustively from
the report of Secretary Guge. He shows
the surplus for the year to be 179.627,060.18,
and estimates the surplusof the coming year
atlso.ooo.OM. He saya the present condition
of the treasury Is one of undoubted strength.
The available cash balance November SO
was tm&d.itH.BO. Under the form of
statement prior to the financial law of
March H Inst this would have been In
cluded In the statement of available cash
gold coin and bullion held for th redemp
tion of United States notes.
Farther Financial l.ealalatlon.
H recommends further financial legis
lation in the following words:
it will be the duty as I am sure It will
be the disposition of the congress to pro
vide whatever further legislation Is need
ed to Insure the coutlnued parity under
all conditions between our two forms of
metallic money, silver snd gold.
Our surplus revenues have permitted the
secretary of the treasury since the close

The beneficial effect of th financial act
Of 1300. so far aa It ralatea to the modifi
cation of the national banking act. Is al
ready apparent. The provision lor tne
incorporation of national banks with a
capital of not leas than l-o.ow In places
not exceeding S.000 lnhabltsnts has result
ed In the extension of bsnking faellitlea
to many smsll communities hitherto un
sble to provide themselves with bsnking
Institutions under the national system.
There were organised from the enact
ment of the law up to and Including
November In. Itm national banks, of which
fit) were with capltsl less than 130,000 and
i"j witn capital ot iju.'jw or more.
It Is worthy of mention that the greater
number of banks being organised under
the new law are In sections where th
need of banking facilities has been most
pronounced. lows stsnds first, with SO
hanks of the smaller clan, while Texas,
Oklahoma, Indian territory and the mid
dle and western sections of the country
have also availed themselves largely of
tne privileges unoer in new law.
Oar Forelaa Trade.
Our foreign trade shows a remarkabl
record of commercial and Industrial prog
ress. Tne totsi ot imports sna exports
for the Hrst time In the history of the
country exceeds IJ.OOO.OOO.UW. The exports
sre greater than they hav ever been
before, the total for the fiscal year 10

of S16',4,'80, an Increase over 1W8 of 1163,
000.7 over 1S97 of 1343.488.&;, and greater
than inw oy s.Mi.8,t,m.
The growth of manufactures In the
I'nlted States Is evidenced bv the fact
that exports of manufactured products
largely exceed tnose ot any previous year,
their value for 100 being S413.lul.'iM.
against S.'CS.SK.llS In ISM, an Increase of
tt per cent.
Agricultural products were also export
ed during 1900 In greater volume than In

The Imports for the year amounted to

rials for manufacture, and is in response
to the rapid development of manufactur
ing in tne united states.
Th Internnl Revenne Tax.
I recommend that the congress at Its

nua taxes Imoosed to meet the expenses
of the wsr witn opsin in me sum or .-

Th Trast Qneatlon.
Th trust question receives th atten
tion of the president, and he says:
it la apparent that uniformity of legis
lation upon this subject In the several
states Is much to be desired. It Is to be
hoped thsl such uniformity, founded In
wise snd Just discrimination between what
I Injurious and what Is useful and neces
sary In business operations, may be ob
tained, and that means may be found for
the congress, within the limitations of Its
constitutions! power, so to supplement an
effective code of state legislation as to
make a complete system cf Isws through
out the United States adequate to compel
a general observance of the salutary rule
lo which I hav referred."
Th Phtllpplnea.
Considerable attention Is given th sub
ject of th Philippines, and In this con
nection the scope and work of tb Phil
ippine commission aa outlined to the com
missioners la fully outlined lor the bene
fit of congress. Of the present condi
tions In the islsnds the president aays:
In my last annual meaaage I dwelt at
some length upon the condition of af
fair In the Philippines. While seeking
to impress upon you that the grave re
sponsibility of lbs future government of
those Islands rest with the congress of
the United Slates, I abstained from rec
ommending at that time (. apecltic and
final form of government for the terri
tory actually held by th United State
force and In which, as long Insur
rection continue, the military arm must
necessarily be aupreme. I stated my pur
pose, until the congress shall have made
known 'he formal exoresslon of I's will,
to use the authority vested In ml by the
constitution and the statutes In uphold
the sovereignty of the United Stales lo
those distant Islands as In all other p'.aces
where our flag rlsht'ully floats, placing,

of th will of th congress having beed
made, I hav steadfastly pursued the pur
nose so declared. smDlovinc the civil arm

pacification and th institution oi local
government within th Un of author

been favorable. Our forcee hav suc

order and administrative regularity to all
quarters. What opposition remains I for
tne most part scattered, ooeyuisr no con
certed plan of strategic action, operating
only by the methods common to the tra
ditions of guerrilla warfare, which, whil
Ineffective to alter the general control
now established, ar still sufficient td
tweet Inaerurltv sninns the noDUlstiOn
that have felt the good results of our
control, and thus delay th conferment
upon them of the fullest measures ot
local self-government, of education, and
of Industrial and agricultural develop

them.
Rv the snrlnsr nf this vesr the effective
opposition of Ihs dissatisfied tagals t
tne nutnority of in united mates was
virtually ended, thus opening th door
for th extension of a stable adminis
tration over much of th territory ot
the archipelago. Desiring to bring this
bout. I appointed In March last a civil
commission composed of Hon. William
H. Taft, of Ohio; Prof. Oean C. Worcester,
or Michigan; Hon. Luke fc. wrignt, or Ten
nessee; Hon. Henry C. Id, of Vermont,
nnd Prof Hernnrd Moses, of California.

of their authority are clearly set forth
