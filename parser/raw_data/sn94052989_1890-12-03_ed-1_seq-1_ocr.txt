VOLUME LXVIII-NO. 3.
A BITTER FIGHT.
Another Stormy Session of Home-
Rule Leaders.
Nolan's Amendment Defeated- The Rational
. League Rallying to the Support cf
Their Chieftain.
Special to Thh Morn-ins Cali.
Ix>!vnoN, Dee. 2.— Parnell and his sup
porters held a conference in the library of
the Bouse of Commons this morning.
The meeting of the Irish Members of Com
mons to consider tlic advisability of remov
ing Parnell was resumed at noon. Parnell
was the first cf the party to arrive. Be
porters were excluded.
About half an hour was occupied in rend
ing telegr.iuis from various persons in Ire
laud and the United States and the man
ifesto sent by the delegates of the party nnv
in the United States. The reading of the
dispatches was frequently iuteatupted by
cheering.
J. O'Kelly asserted that it would be the
basest ingratitude for the Nationalists to
abandon Parnell simply because a number
of politicians who sought an alliance with
the Irish party for their own advantage
now thought lit to abandon the position
Parne'l had taken.
The meeting then adjourned for luncheon.
A SHARP CONTROVERSY.
The members reassembled at 2 o'clock,
when Parnell moved to adjourn, to enable
the Nationalists to take part in the debate
; on the second reading or the Land Pur
chase Bill. -No stone will be left unturned
to postpone indefinitely the decision of t'.ie
party on tiie question of Pamell's re'ire
: ment and have the issue of to-day aban
doned.
A sharp controversy took place concern
ing the cable dispatches sent the delegates
"* in the United States for the purpose of in
fluencing tbeir action.
Kenny admitted tliat he cabled his views
to the delegates.
Sexton said the supplementary cable, in
the party's name after the conference hell
Friday night, did not accord with the ar
rangements made at the conference.
PARNKI-L'S ACTION JUSTIFIED.
John O'Connor declared the business bad
net been conducted fairly, lie justified
'Parnell's action in issuing his manifesto
and condemned as misleading the dispatches
that were scut to the delegates inthe United
States.
Campbell described the proceedings of
Parnell's opponents as infamous.
Parnell was appealed to to decide whether
the expression used by Campbell was
orderly.
He replied that the country would decide
as to their proceedings.
Further recriminations were indulged in
regarding tiie informal meeting held last
Saturday.
■ Healy described the actions of Parnell's
friends as. obstructive.
Parnell dem-unced the remark as insolent
and impertinent. This statement was
greeted with cheers by Parnell's frieuds
and answered with cheers of derision by his
opponents.
FALSE IMPRESSIONS.
Leamy said tbe telegrams to America
from Sextoi aud others had produced false
impressions by implying that a majority of
. the leading men nf the party were goiug in
one direction
William Brdmond said he heard the dele
gates' cablegram was read by certain mem
bers of the patty in au English club and re
ceived with cheers. "If Parnell is to be
deposed," said he, "in God's name deuce
him without making it a matter for cheer
ing ir an English club."
NOLAN'S AMENDMENT REJECTED.
Nolan's amendment that the question of
the retirement of Paruell be postpoued until
Uie 'members ascertained the views of their
constituents was rejected. The vote was
«4 to 39. The ininoritv voting on the amend
ment were: John P. Nolan, Joseph Nolan,
. : Blanc, Byrne, Corbett, Clancy, Campbell,
Dalton, Fitzgerald, A. 1). \V. Harrington,
Hayden, Macdonald, Huntley, McCarthy,
McKenna, M.ihoney, Maguire, O'Connor,
O'Hanlon, O'Kelley, Parnell, Kichard Pow
er, Gjuiuu, John ltedinond, William Ked
..niond. Shiel, Conway, J. E. Keuuy and
Leamy. Messrs. Carew, Gilhooly, P. O'Brien,
. Leahy, I.alor and Mation were absent. No
''.demonstration WM made over the result of
the division.
Arthur O'Connor advised Parnell to with-
X draw, as henceforth it would be impossible
for bim to be the leader of the party.
: Jordan accused Parnell of sacrificing the
cause of the nation to his pride aud culpable
ambition.
At 6 o'clock the meeting adjourned for an
hour.
THE EVENING SESSION.
' Upon reassembling Kenny declared it im
possible tn obtain home rule without form
leg an alliance with the English party.
"Parnell," Ire said, "had been offered au
honorable compromise."
The Chairman— What was it?
. Kenny— To retire temporarily. But In
stead if accepting this oiler Parnell issued a
manifesto debarring him from the chairman
ship henceforth, should a majority oi his
party decide that It would he best for him to
retire. Why did Parnell in June ex
press his implicit belief in the good faith
of the Liberal party, having the Ilawartien
interview in mind? He (Kenny; had little
. bope lot the Irish party if they depended
' tipou ihe Chairman to defend tliem from the
chicanery • f English statesmen. Irishmen
; looked to their representatives in the House
of Commons, uot to Parnell alone, for sal
vation.
PAR.VEI.I, DENOUNCED.
J. F. O'Biien declared they hadlktle lead
ership from Parnell in recent years. After
the exposure resulting from ttie divorce suit
he had come to the conclusion that Parnell's
continuance in the leadership would be an
iutolerabl" disitrnce. O'Brien bitterly re
proached Parnell for his connection with
ihe Hawarden interview.
Angry reiorts were made by Parnell, who
denied that he had said Gladstone was
false.
in conclusion, O'Brien said: "I leave it to
y< v, Mr. Parnell, to convince the Irish
people of honesty on yonr part in that
grave nirrtter. This is the wretchedest
mom. Nt i.f my life. I see shattered by you,
who brought us to our splendid position, all
of Ireland-, hopes."
The meeting here adjourned for dinner.
When 'ho meeting recouveued after din
ner, it was finally elicited that Parnell's
Secretary, Cnm-abell, gave Mr. Tuohy of the
Freemau's Journal his own opinion tliat
. Parnell would voluntarily retire. Tuohy
repeated this in the lobbies of Parliameut.
Alt»r some talk the subject was dropped.
.-. At to-tnnrrow's meeting Clancy will sub
mit a compromise resolution. It is reported
lie vi ill propose that Parnell retire tempo
. rarily.
at'CARTHT SUSTAINED.
Kir William Vernon Harcourt has written
a letter in which he confirms McCarthy's
statement made at the Parnell meeting last
nifcht relative to what took place between
them at the time ot McCaitliy's recent visit
to him. Sir William further sa>s he did not
regard Parnell's proposals as practical.
LIBERALS IN COUNCIL.
Arnold Morley, Sir George O. Trevelyan,
Campbell, Baniieruiauu, Sir William Ver
non Harcourt, Enrl Granville aud Shaw
Lefevle assembled at Gladstone's residence
this morning ami conferred an hour with
the ex-Preinler, The subject under discus
sion was the retirement of the Liberal
leader, lt was decided to convoke a meet
ing of Liberal peers and members of the
Comiui ns to hear a statement by G ad stone.
Itisexp-ctcd that a meeting of the Lib
eral members of the Commons and the
Lords v. ill shortly be held to consider the
political situation.
WILL SUPPORT PABNELL.
The meeting of the National League
branch at Bailylauders scut a dispatch to
. Finnc-anc, d' daring that he must either sup
port Parnell or resign.
At Abbey leix. Queens County, the Board
f
of Guardians has resolved to support Par
nell. The board declared that while reuts
were still too high the reduction made was
dU3 to Parnell.
"COLLEAGUES, NOT SLAVES."
At yesterday's meeting of the Parlia
mentary representatives of the Nationalist
party. Sexton, who opposes Parnell, made
an allusion to a statement by Parnell in the
manifesto that the Badical wire-pullers
sapped Ihe integrity of the Nationalist
party. Parnell angrily retorted that his
statement referred only to a section of the
party ami animadverted upon the conspiracy
existing in every hole and corner of the
House of Commons between certain Irish
members of the House and Heurv Labou
chere and Stuart. Sexton claimed "that be
himself ami his friends had been lojal to
the party. and added, "We are your col
leagues, Parnell, and not your slaves."
The Star, in an article inspired by Pro
fessor Stuart, repudiates Parnell's state
ment that there was a conspiracy in the
Commons h-tween himself, Labouchere and
certain Nationalists.
THE LAND BILL.
In the Commons to-day Balfour moved
tnat the I: isli Land Purchase Uiil ya-s to its
second reading.
Ellis moved an amendment declaring the
bill unsafe as regards the Imperial ex
chequer and unjust to the occupants of the
laud.
Gladstone said he found nothing in the
changes in the bill since the last session
likely to render its character more satisfac
tory. He reminded tbe House, iv view
of the fact tli.it circumstances pre
vented the presence of the Irish
members to-night, that it would ba
a grent mistake to pass a land bill opposed
lo their desires and convictions. The want
ol Irish authority went to the root of the
whole matter and impelled every true frieud
of Ireland to oppose the bill.
Chamberlain advised Balfour to withdraw
his concession removing the twenty years'
limit, but to adhere to the rate-payers' pleb
iscite.
Balfour replied that he estimated the total
amount required to complete the purchase
at £95,000,000 The bill, in providing for an
advance of £33,000,000, would make a great
impression and greatly simplify the prob
lem. He would reconsider the question of
the twenty-year limit. Tiie rate-payers'
plebiscite he considered a valuable alter
ation.
THE NATIONAL LEAGUE.
Our.i.iN*. Uec. .'.-A meeting of the Na
tional League was held to-day. Tho pro
ceedings were stormy. The names of Sex
ton and Healy alien irtentioned were
greeted with gromis ami his«es. The Chair
man made a violent speech In favor of Par
nell. A Protestant moved and a Cathol c
priest seconded a resolution calli-iu upon
Ireland to support Parnell. The resolution
was carried, wi'h a few dissenting votes.
'Ihe Freeman's Journal says; Time is a
great leveler. We do not object to having
the decision of the Nationalist party relative
to the tetenliou of Parnell in the leadership
postponed until the feeling of the country
has had time to manifest itself unmistak
ably. Dublin is crt July a fit place for such
a decision to be taken. "It would then un
doubtedly be an Irish judgment.
Lincoln* i.Xcbr.), Dec. 2.— At a special
meeting; of the Lincoln Branch of the Irish
National League this evening resolutions nf
confidence in Parnell wen- adopted and
cal.led to nim. President Fitzgerald and
Secretary Sutton of the national organiza
tion still decline to express any opinion
pending the meeting of the Executive
Council.
AMKIHCAN DELEGATES RECALLED.
CHICAGO, Dec. 2.— Timothy Harrington,
the only one of the Irish delegation here
who is in favor of Parnell, to-day received
the following telegram from Redmond and
Kelly, supporters of Parnell: "Return to
England at once if you want to save the
party. Affairs are in a critical condition,
and yonr heip is much needed. Implore the
other members of the visiting party to come
also." Harrington could not be found, and
Uillon disclaimed auy knowledge of the ca
blegram.
Sydnkv, Dec. 2.— The Morning Herald
prints Interviews showing the Irish leaders
in Australia are in favor of the retirement
of Painell.
A GAME OF OBSTRUCTION.
New York, Uec. 2.— The World's Lon
don spicial says: Parnell is playing the
same game of obstructi n on his own party,
which be lias often used with such powerful
effect in the Commons and perhaps he will
win by it. He claims that every day i.f de
lay weakens the opposition. He claims to
have weaned three more members from the
opposition, while the anti-Parnellitcs assert
that the members who have deserted them
are unimportant men, aud that the large
majority insistiug ou Parnell's retirement is
not affected.
Edward Harrington, Secretary of the Na
tional League, has joined Parnell, and most
of the officers i.f the league have followed
I'ini. He has ordered the niaciiinerv of the
league to tie sit In motion, and Is working it
in tne interest of Parnell. Tlie league funds
are securely locked up in a Paris bank, and
not a penny can be drawn except by check,
signed by Parnell and indorsed hv his
colleagues of the League Executive"Com
mittee, including Justin McCarthy.
The control of tiiese funds elves Parnell
immense power over the Irish members,
most of whom are dependent upon tbem for
tbeir salaries. Painell knows how and
where to apply tho pressure. The question
j f utilizing the moneys now being collected
in America has been discussed by the oppo
nents of Parnell. It is proposed that they
be used as Parliamentary funds so long as
the regular supplies are withheld by the
deadlock which he has created.
almost certain defeat.
The Times' London special says: At mid
night Parnell, facing certain defeat, is more
srilnliiea In his demeanor than yesterday.
Courteous and dignified and to tiie
last exhausting all the devices of obstrnc
tinn, he announced the votes proclaiming
tho destruction of bis leadership with
as much calmness as if he were uncon
cerned. During the debates he resolutely
and unfairly ruled all poiuts iv his own
favor. Still he conciliated bis opponents
with his politeness and geiitleuian
liness. The Irish patty's decision
has now been practically recorded, but Par-
Hell, clinging de-perately to a pretense of
leader.-hip, lias prepared a series ol filibus
tering motions for to-morrow and will not
allow a vote to be taken on the main ques
tion while obstruction is possible.
IRISHMEN" IN NEW YORK.
Amcng Irish-Americans here tliere have
been few voices raised iv support nf the
continued leadership of Parnell of the Parlia
mentary forces, but it is insignificant in
comparison with the opinions nf the influen
tial boay of Irishmen which have been ex
pressed on the opposite. Henry McKeenan,
oue of the founders of the Irish Parliament
ary Fund says: "The action most necessary is
to follow the advice of O'lirien, Oillon and
other misted representatives of Ireland in
the himlish Parliament, in calling upon
Parnell to make way for some other Irish
member who will lead the Parliamentary
party in conjunction with the English Lib
eral party to an assurer! triumph in behalf
of the horns rule cause."

IMMINENT DANGER.
Gen, Miles Thinks the Sitnation
Has Not Been Exaggerated.
Preparations In Progress for a Long Cam
paign—The Disaffection More Wide
spread Than for Years.
Special to^TitK Moknixo Car.-.
Washington, Dec. 2.— General Miles, In
an interview to-day on the Indian trouble,
•aid he believed danger imminent. "The
seriousness of the situation," he said, " has
not been exaggerated. The disaffection is
more widespread than for years. The con
spiracy extends to the different tribes that
have heretofore been hostile, but are now iv
full sympathy with each other, though scat
tered over a large area of country. The
causes of the difficulty aie easy ol location.
Insufficient food supplies, religious delusion
and the innate disposition of a savage to go
to war must be held responsible."
" Are the campaign preparations on the
part of the Government complete?" was
asked.
"Not quite," replied the General. "Every
thing will be ready In a few days, though.
Troops and supplies en route will be avail
able very speedily. All that is possible is
being done to cucourage the loyal and re
duce the number and influence of the hos
tiles, and in this way an outbreak may be
avoided."
General Miles referred to the great neces
sity which existed for more cavalry, "al
though," he s iid. "we have about two thou
sand mounted men. We have plenty of in
fantry, but you cannot catch mounted In
dians with white foot soldiers."
"Is it not a novel proceeding for Indians
to go on the warpath at the begiuuing of
winter?" queried tlic reporter.
"Yes, in some respects it is," replied the
General "Their argument is good, though.
Tliey are better armen now tlian ever, and
their supply of horses is all that could be
desired. Every buck has a Winchester
rifle and knows how to use it. They cnn live
on their cattle, and numerous horse ranches
will furnish them with fresh stock when
cold -and staivation ruin their mounts.
These hostiles have been starved into fight
ing, and they will prefer to die firthting
rather than starve peaceably. I hope the
problem may be solved without bloodshed,
but such a hippy endiug to tbe trouble
seems improbable."
General Miles, after a long consultation
with the Secretary of War and General
Schofield, left for Chicago this morning. ,
MOVEMENT OF TROOPS.
General William*, Chief ot Staff under
General Miles, has been ordered to duty in
Washington. Colonel Corhin has been ap
pointed to succeed him as Chief of Staff at
Chicago.
Four companies of cavalry have been
ordered from Fort Leavenworth lo the seat
of the threatened trouble, and are now on
the way. They are selected from the First,
Second, Fifth and Ninth regiments. Or
ders also have been sent to the First In
fantry, stationed on the Paciirc Coast, the
Fifth Regiment in Texas and tho Seventh
Regiment at Denver to hold themselves in
readiness to start for the ludiau couutry at a
moment's uotice.
Acting Indian Commissioi.er Belt to-day
received a letter from Special t'eusus Agent
Lee at line Ridge Agency, saying tliere is
no suffering tliere among the Indians for
want of food. lie asseits the preseut trou
bles are not due to hunger.
Standing I'.ock Agency*, Oec. 2.— Orders
have beeu issued to Major McLaughlin to
increase tlio rations from 8 to 10 per cent.
Reports from Sitting Buil's camp repoit a
decided decrease in dances.
Uenveu, Dec. 2.— The eutire comman I at
Fort Logan leaves to-morrow morning for
the s. eno of Indian disturbance in Uakota.
Kansas City, Dec. 2— Lieutenant Mo-
Conib, in command of the Sion**; at F.>rt
Reno, was in this erty this evening. He
stated that the Cheyenne* and Arapahoe*
had hud several dances of late, but they liad
no hostile siguibciiuce whatever. Jacob
Cadmire, Receiver of the Land Oflice at
Kingfisher, telegraphs that tliere is no ex
citement, und that those who bave been par
ticipating in the dances have returned home.
Special dispatches from Guthrie say tliere
is no danger of an outbreak among ludiaus
iv the Territory.
TUE SITUATION CRITICAL.
Chicago, Uec. 2.— lmportant telegrams
have come from the Indian country, but
General Williams refused to divulge their
contents until General Miles' arrival from
Washington. The situation is regarded as
critical. General Brooke telegraphs that a
number of Rosebud Indians, wuh some Irom
the Pine Ridce Agency and some from the
Lower Urule and Standing Rock Agencies
to the number of 300, have gathered on
Wiiite River above its mouth under the
leadership of Wounded Kueo and are very
defiant
PBZPABEra FOR ACTION.
Omaha, Uec. 2— Advices from Pine Ridge
Agency report tliat the troops are e.xpect.'d
to advance to the Bad Lnmis at once, and
provision is being made for v lougcamialgu.
I'he Government lias advertised for forage
and transportation. Indian scouts report
more depredations and excitement runs very
high. The army officers at Pine Ridge pie
diet the expedition will be aa rough and as
important as any iv Indian history.
SITTING BULL'S FORCES.
New Yokk, Uec. 2.— The Herald has a
dispatch from W. F. Cudy at Mandan, Dak.,
which says: "Have just arrived from Sit
ting Bull and Chief Gull country. When I
left yesterday they were still* dancing
men, women and children. They said they
were going to druiee all winter or die. anij
if they did die it would bo good meilicine, as
they would come to life in the spring and
would not be cold and hungry this winter.
In this part of North Dakota Sitting Bull is
a great disturber and prupliet. lt it were
spring tliere would be war, and as the In
diaus are so well armed and moirutrd many
a home Would lay low and many thousands
of innocent lives be lost. The Indiana are
waiting for the coming ol the Messiah. The
winter has set in, and if the Messiah dies
not get a move on himself the snow will
blow through his whiskers so rapidly that
he will forget to materialize."
CAUSE OF THE TROUBLE?
Bismarck, Dec. 2.— Owing to a delay of
the traius, Buffalo Bill oid not start for the
East till noon to-day. Ke proceeds directly
to Chicago for a conference with General
Miles. In conversation here to-day he ex
pressed the opinion that all the trouble with
the Indians is caused by Sitting Bull and a
few oilier crafty leaders, who are working
upon the supeistitious nature of their fol
lowers for the purpose of bringing tbe Gov
eriiiii. Nt to terms on the subject of back
dues and increased rations. Cody does uot
look for an uprising, but thinks the military
must he kept iv hand in full strength until
the religious craze subsides, or there will be
depredations in the spring, which would be
apt to bring on a war.
EFFECT OF COLD WEATHER.
Pierre, Dec. 2.— Letters were received
to-day from the commandants at Port Sully
and Fort Bennett, stating that the Indian
frontier, so far as that country is con
cerned, is perfectly safe. An officer who has
just returned from a personal visit to
Hump's aud Big Foot's camps, on Cherry
Creek, states that cold weather and
snow nad driven the Indians in from tho
ghost dances. T hey advise all the settlers
to procure rifles and plenty of ammunition
this winter, because the danger of an out
break in the spring is great.

ARRESTED POR FORGERY.
Bogai Will of a Wealthy Englishman Sign ci
by P. rrin H. Sumner.
New York, Dec. 2.— Perrin H. Sumner,
a Broadway real-estate speculator, who
gained considerable notoriety in connection
with the mysterious suicide of a mau who
registered at the Getty House, in Ydnkers,
as George Smith, was arrested to-day
charged with forgery. The prisoner identi
fied the suicide as his friend, James H. Ed
gar, a wealthy English chemist. The police,
after thoroughly investigating tho matter
at the time, came to the conclusion
that it was a scheme to defraud
some life - insurance company, and
satisfied that they had thwarted it,
dropped the matter. A reporter named
Geoigo 11. rhoebus, bow ever, kept at work
on the mystery, and as a result of his in
vestigation. Sumner was to-day arrested.
It seems that Edgar owned property worth
$300,000. Sumner, afterthe suicide,' made v
proposition to lawyer Turner to draw up a
will of which Sunnier was to be the ex
ecutor and to receive teu per cent of
the fortune. The lawyer rejected tie prop
osition, but afterwards, upon the solicita
tion of reporter Phoebus, introduced the
latter to Sumner. The will was drawn up
by Turner. Tliere were also some affidavits
drawn in furtherance of Sumner's si heme.
Phoebus personating the notary public. It
was in the signing of tho will that Sumner
committed forgery. Nothing can be found
of Edgar, but it is quite positive he was not
the man who suicided iv Yonkers. Who
that mysterious per.-on was is not yet
learned. The suspicion Is that Edgar is a
fugitive from jnsoee from England and the
police surmise that he was in the dark con
cerning the bogus will, and that Sum
ner, who was willing to resort to
forgery, ultimately intended to enm
init murder. Sunnier at the time of the
suicide, told about Edgar's nephew, who
had given him the in formation about bis
uncle. 'l"his young mau cannot be found.
The police will make a careful investigation
of the case. Sumner has before been con
cerned in some shady transactions.
Sumner n as at one time a resident of Cali
fornia. Plrccbiis says he told several con
tradictory stories.

BOLD BOBBBBT.
A Cashier "H-lu Up" in Ha Office end Re
lievd rf a Liree Sum tf Money.
CnitAoo, Uec. 2.— ln broad daylight this
afternoon Joseph N. Asier, Cashier of the
Allertou Packing Company's establishment
at the stock-yards, was "held uo" in his
office by two men of granger-like Rppear
atice, and relieved of Sr'.^oo in cash. The
money had been brought in from the bank a
few minutes before to pay off the men. Two
strangers suddenly entered the office, and iv
au instant the Cashier was looking down
the muzzle of a big revolver. He was com
manded to empty the money into a canvas
bag, which was held by the secoud stranger.
Erg' leen hundred men were working in the

HIGHLY PLEASED.
Republicans Delighted Witli
Harrison's Message.
Secretary Noble's Report on the Mission
Indians and Sequoia National
Park— Personal Notes.
Special to The Mornixo CAit
TVashij-gtos. Uec. 2.— A very general
satisfaction with tho President's message is
expressed at the Capitol. Tbe Republicans
speak in the highest praise of tiie courage
and wisdom expressed, while the Uemocrats
say they are delighted with it because it is
so unwise and radically opposed to what
the people of the country favor. There
may be a few Republicans who do not ap
prove of the suEgestion against free coin
age, and others may think that it would bo
wisor "to go slow" on the Federal Election
Bill, but these are keeping very quiet, and
there is a unanimity of praise for the
message from Republican sources.
REPUBLICAN* LEADERS DELIGHTED.
It is in line with the policy of the party
leaders In both houses of Congress, and is
an indorsement of the plan already well de
fined. It adopts the most radical and coura
geous policy advised, and the leaders aro
enthusiastic iv their eageruess to carry it
out.
Cannon and others who are counted as
leaders can hardly find words to express
their satisfaction. Morrow would no doubt
have been better pleased If it had been pro
nouneud in favor of free silver coinage, but
as a whole he considers it an admirable
document. Most of the other Pacific Coast
members may be said to eutertaiu the samo
opinion of it
MIZNT.R'S RECALL.
President Harrison's action In recalling
Minister Mizuer is especially pleasing to
McCreary of Kentucky, Chairman of the
Foreign Affairs Committee under the U<*mo
cratic regime, as it sustains the position
taken hy him in his speech in the House just
before the close of the last session. Mc-
Creary, it will be remeiuhored, introduced a
resolution calliug upon the President for the
correspondence in the Mi/.iier-Barruudia
affair, aud as no answer had been made to
this resolution, he held a conference with
his colleagues on tho Foreign Affairs Com
mittee last Sunday uight as to tlio proper
line of farther Hction.
SI'CKEAi:*" IS PLEASED.
" The statement in the Presidet.t's mes
sage," said McCreary tothe California Asso
ciated Press correspondent, " removes the
necessity for any further steps in the mat
ter. I disagree with the President on the
silver question, Elect ons Bill and the tariff,
but in tl: is matter he is right. He simply
follows all precedents and sustains tbe dig
nity of tbe nation."
lt may be said that Governor McCreary's
opinion is not shared by a great many pub
lic ii, en here. Much regret and sympathy
for Mizner is heard on all sides and this is
not confined to cither party.
PENSION APPROPRIATION* DILL.
The first bill to be reported this session is
the Pension Apt mptfatloo Bill, which
Representative Morrow yesterday presented
inthellouse. The bill, which was refeired
to the Committee of the Whole, carries an
appropriation of $135,009,785. Its details
have already been pit Oli shed. VVhon the
bill is taken up for cousideraiion a lively de
bate is expected upon it. A statement will
probahly be made from the Republican side
that no more general pension bills will be
pressed for passage this session, ttie senti
mentof the Pension Committed being against
such legislation. A strong fis-ht will be
made to secure the enactment of the Prison
ers of War Bill, but even the majority is not
a unit on the advisability of tliis action.
Their opposition is ba-ed on the wound
that the prisoners who suffered the grea^st
amount of injury aud who would nflve
been most entitled to the benefits of the act
are ill dead. In view of the feeling on the
subject ot pensious it may be confidently
predicted that the bill intioJuced yesrerd iy
by Representative Pickler will sleop in ths
committee's pigeon-hole. Mr. Pickler pro
poses that no person now on the pension
ri lis or who may be placed upon them shall
receive less than $(i a mouth.
REAPPORTIONMENT.
The Star -ays: It seems probable that
the Census Committee will agree upon an
apportionment bill which will settle the
number of Representatives at 350, or one or
two members less. At 348 tho changes
would be: Gains— Arkansas 1, California
1, Colorado 1, Illinois l, Slnssacbusetts 1,
Michigan 1, Minnesota l, Miss-mri 1, Ne
braska 9, New Jersey 1, Oregon 1, Pennsyl
vania 2, Texas 2, Washington 1, Kansas 1.
Tho losses are: Indiana 1, Kentucky 1,
South Carolina 1, "Virginia 1. According to
this table the gains and losses are distributed
as follows, tiie classification being that in
Vo2iie before tho late elections: The Re
publicans would gain 15, and the Uemocrats
5. 'ihe Uemocrats would lose 4. This
would bo a net gain to tbe Republicans of 14.
PUBLIC BUILDING BILL.
The fact that 142 public building bills are
on tbe calendar of the House has not de
terred Vandever from coming forward with
a bill appropriating $700,0u0 for public build
ings for a military post at Suu Diego, Cal.
Nearly forty of these side-tracked bills are
on tbe calendar as unfinished business,
many of them having beeu switched off just
as they were about to bo brought into the
terminus of the third reading and final pas
sage. His bill Is substantially the same as
that introduced in the Senate, the provisions
of which have already been printed in the
California Ass dated Press dispatches.
SECRETARY NOBLE'S REPORT.
The Secretary of the Interior's report has
come lrom the printing office. The geuerai
features of this report were printed in yes
terday's dispatches. There are several
topics discussed of local interest to the
Pacific Coast on the subject of Mission
Indians. He says: " The Mission Indians,
whose rights were fully recognized and re
spected by both the Spanish and Mexican
Governments, have suffered such wrongs
under our Government tliat they have
formed the subject of numerous official re
ports daring the last twenty years. The
executive departments nave done all that
was possible to protect them in the posses
siou of their ancient homes and villages,
and to repress the encroachments that are
constantly attempted upon their lands. But
through the failure oi legislative action their
situation has grown worse from year to
year, innocent settlers bave also doubtless
oeen deprived of their just rights and made
to sutler ur. deserved losses through the in
ability of tbe department to properly dis
criminate between them and willful tres
passers. A bill for the relief of these
Indians, under which It is hoped the rights
of both Indians and settlers can be ascer
tained, defined aud protected, passed the
Senate during the Forty-eighth, Forty
ninth and Fiftieth Congresses, failing each
time in tne House of Representatives. It
was again passed by the Senate during the
recent session, and was uuder consideration
in the House, but failed to pass from want
of time. The necessity for this legislation
has been repeatedly shown.
BOUND VALLKY INDIANS.
"The last session of Congress enacted long
delayed legislation looking to the adjustment
of seiicus embarrassments suiTouiuiiug the
Round Valley Reservation ludians in Cali
fornia, Northern Cheyenne Indians in Mon
tana and Soutb Dakota, the Turtle Moun
tain Chippewas iv North Dakota, Puyallup
Reservation Indians in Washington, Meno
minee Indians in Wisconsin aud other In
dians, and lt is earnestly hoped that a
measure for the Mission Indians may become
a law during the present session."
SEQUOIA NATIONAt PARK.
On the subject of Sequel National Park
he says: "This name was given because of
the Sequoia trees, wbicb were thus named
by Endlicher, in honor of Sequiah, the in
ventor of the Cherokee alphabet. The Gov
ernor of California, in a letter last Septem
ber, states in substance that the greatest
difficulty will be in the extinguishment of
private rights. No doubt the lands set apart
for the park will be found covered with
private claims, the annihilation of wbicb
will be exceedingly expensive, and this cost
should be borne by the United States Gov
ernment, California extending all necessary
protection in tho way of legislation. The first
step should be to procure absolute posses
sion ; then it should be passed to the control
of the General Land Office, with instruc
tions to appoint a forester. The United
States District Attorney should be notified
of trespasses ond no improvements should
be Detuiitted by private persons. It has cost
California $100,000 to extinguish private
claims in the Yosemite, aud the letting out
of leases would inaugurate an extensive class
of private claims which would cost §10,000
to get rid of."
NECESSARY LEGISLATION.
The Secretary then quotes the resolutions
regarding Sequoia Park, adopted last Au
gust by the California Academy of Sciences,
and concludes as follows: "Evc-v effort
will be made witn the means at haud to pre
serve the trees and natural beauties of
both Yosemito and Sequoia parks, and to
expel trespassers and to punish those vio
lating the law or rules; but Congress must
make an appropriation, or the Secretary of
tbe Interior will be left with a gigantic re
sponsibility and only dwarfed resources to
meet it The parks have already gain-d the
favor of our people, aud there would be
probably no criticism of a reasonable ex
penditure to support them."
"LAND DECISIONS.
In the case of Emma J. Woodbury, on ap
peal from tho Commissioner's decision w
g.iiding her application to purchase land iv
the 11 umboldt District, Calilornia, Secretary
Noble says the department has heretofore
instructed local officers to see that the law
is strictly complied with in reference to
proof, and it does not provide for taking
proof at any place except at the local Land
Office, therefore the Commissioner's decis
ion is affirmed and her application rejected.
In ihe case of Kosa Lehman vs. Ernest
Snow, involving land in the San Fraucisco
Uistrlct, the Secretary modifies the Com
missioner's decision, and says: "The tem
poral removal of the pre-emptor from latul
of his own prior to establishing a residence
on his pre-emption claim will not lake such
claim out of the inhibition continued in ihe
statute. Suow's filing will therefore be can
celed, and, siuce Miss Lehman has fulfilled
all the requirements of the law, siie will not
be required to show new proof, aud the lo
cal officers ate directed to a low the entry
with a view of submitting the same to a
board of equitable jurisdiction for confirma
tion."

Counterfeit I'leoHS.
A bag of dollars was found last Saturday

Though the exact amount of coin found in
tbe bag is not known rumor bas it that it
was nearly $1000 in cleverly counterfeited

FAKMi-IKS' ALLIANCE.
A Beviaw ef the Cannes of Agricultural De
pression by President Polk.
Ocala (Fla.), Dec. 2.— The National
Farmers' Alliance and Industrial Union
met at noon. President Polk delivered the
annual address, which congratulated the
alliance on the achievements since last meet
ing, reviewed the causes of agricultural de
pression and ueclared this depression was
an anomaly to the stmleut of industrial
progress. "Retrogression in American
agriculture," he said, "means national de
cay, ami, powerful and promising as is tbis
youug giaut republic, yet its power and
glury do not relieve the degradation of the
American farmer." The harm iucident to
the centralization of money power aud the
upbuilding of monopolies was then pointed
out and both political parties condemned for
forcing and encouraging this condition.
Ihe President urged that additional organ
izers be sent at ouce into Oregon, Washing
ton, Ohio, New York, New Jersey arid
other States and Arizona Territory. Among
the recommendations was one that an or
ganization be formed to be known as tho
National Leg Mature, composed of the Na
tinnal President aud Presidents of all the
State alliances, to look closely after the
legislative reforms demanded by the alliance,
both in the State Legislatures aud iv Con
gress.
In his remarks upon the proposed na
tional legislative council, President Polk
said au organizatu.n of tliis kind would
wield a power which would "enforce the re
spect of any legislative boJv to which it might
appeal. Touching upon the political action
of the alliauce, President Polk said: "VVhilo
our organization is political, it cannot ba
partisan or sectional in its action, in sup
port of this declaration we proudly point to
our whole past record, and to the recent
popular election." Outlining tiie future
financial policy of the alliance, l'oik said it
would demand the restoration of silver to
all the rights aud equalities of legal tender
which gold possesses, the issue of govern
ment i urreucy direct to the people, the
equalization of taxes, prohibition of ulien
ownership of land, ownership and control
of transportation lines by the Govern ment,
limit ot public revenues to an economic ad
ministration of Uie Government, graduated
taxation of incomes, and the. election of
United States Senators by a direct vote of
the people. «•..
Pre-,idence Foulks of the South Dakota
Alliance made a short address, speaking
forcibly upon the breaking down of section
al lilies. An old Union soldier from Indi
ana moved that all the ex-soldiers in the
hall who indorsed tliose seutiuieiits rise.
Forty or fifty stood up "autrvl Hie wildest en
thusiasm. Then an ex-soldier from Wis
consin called upon all the Union men to
give three cheers for the old Confederates
in tbe alliance. They were given with a
will, after which the Confederates returned
toe compliment In a manner tbat left no
doubt as to tue genuineness of their feelings.
Expressions of dissatisfaction are heard
with reference to the conduct of Dr.
Macone. editor of the National Economist,
in taking part in the recent Senatorial tight
in Georgia. It is also charged lhat he has
violated the policy of the alliance in tha
advocacy of the Conger Lard Bill, his oppo
sition to the Paddock Pure-food Bill, and ia
several other ways. This matter will come
up for consideration in a day or two and
will likely cause considerable debate.
i'he alliauce opened the first business ses
sion to-night, aud from vow on all sessions
will bo secret.
The annual meeting of the National Col
ored Farmers' Alliance will be held to-mor
row. The organization embraces twe.ity
two States aud a motuber-hip of over a
million. One of its chief objects is to di- .
vide the negroes politically, wbicli, of course,
meaus taking large numbers of lhem iuto
the voting ranks of the Democratic party.

BABY (M SOLID RASH
Ugly, Painful, Blotched, Malicious,
No Rest Day or Night. Cured
by Cuticura Remedies
in Three Weeks.
Our ohlest chll-l, now six yearn of a«, when aa in
fant six months old, was attacked with a virulent,
malignant •-'■■.l:l "li"--''.-*-. AU ordinary remedies tail
ing, we called our family physician, who attempted
to cure it: but tt spread with almost Incredible
rapidity until the lower portion ot the little fetlow'a
person, from the middle or his back down to bis
knees, was one solid ra-rth. ugly, painful, blotched and
malicious. We had no rest at nigbt, uo peace by day.
Finally, we were advised to try the Cuticura
Ki-.mj- I'tKs. The effect was simply marvelous, ia
three or four weeks a complete cure was wrought,
leaving the little fellow's person as white aud healthy
as though he had never beeu attacked. In my opin
tou your valuable remedies saved his life, aud to-day
he ls a strong, healthy child, perfectly well, no repe
tition ot tbe disease baviug ever occurred.
