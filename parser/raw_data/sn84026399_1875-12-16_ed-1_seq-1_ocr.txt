THE PRESIDENTS MESSAGE.
The Seventh Annual Message of the
President, was submitted on Monday 7th
inst., to Congress. It Is a plain business
pa'per, in style such as any intelligent busi
ness manager might with propriety submit
as his annual report to those with the con
trol of whose affairs he was intrusted. It
only differs from such a report in that it
deals with questions of Statecraft instead
of more sordid questions of trade ; its
superiority and interest lie in the matter
more than the maimer. The President, as
the Chbf Executive of national affairs, has
something to say, through Congress, to the
nation, and he says it clearly and pointedly,
without evincing any particular regard for
the nice requirements of rhetoric. Presi
dent Grant writes with the directness with
which General Grant fought , he writes to
be understood precisely as he fought to be
victorious. The Message covers almost
every question which has engaged the at
tention of the government and country dur
ing the year past, and a more exhaustive
resume of public affairs has seldom been
presented to the country by any of our
Presidents.
Apart from that, however, it has other
claims for popular consideration. Besides
detailing with considerable minuteness what
has been done, and what is doing by the
government, the Message presents several
suggestions and recommendations, about
some of which opinions will widely differ,
and some others of which will be certain to
create vehement, if not bitter feelings among
the people. Tho President, in concluding,
refers in a manner so marked to his early
retirement from the Presidential office as
to seem to make unecessary and impertin
ent any further reference to the lately re
newed third-term discussion ; and, indeed,
there are portions of the Message likely to
provoke so much hostile criticism, and to
be so generally unpopular, as to render their
author altogether unavailable as a possible
future candidate. In them the President
lias clinched the nail which he drove home
in his speech on the School Question at
Des Moines a day or two prior to the Ohio
election.
The pajKjr bfgins with a well-drawn con
trast between the first and the one-hundredth
year of the nation's independence.
Its earliest and its latest condition is set
forth iu terms of excusable exultation.
What we were and wc are the President
briefly, but clearly shows, and then he goes
on to the discussion of the educational ques
tion, supporting lib propositions with well
considered argument. He demands that
education shall be general, compulsory and
unsectarian, ami that it alone shall confer
the right of suffrage. The earnestness with
which he urges and reurges his views upon
this matter is likely to create much discus
sion, and so also is his recommendation
that church property shall be taxed fully
as other property.
Our foreign relations are declared to be
mostly satisfactory ; where they are not so
is with Sp:tin, and to the discussion of
Spanish and Cuban matters, the President
devotes a large portion of his Message. At
the present time diplomacy is busy in the
endeavor to ctiect an amicable understand
ing between the Governments of Washing
ton and Madrid ; but thus far diplomacy
has not effected all that is desirable, and
the President, while declaring as inexpedi
ent recognition of the Cuban patriots, or
conferring upon them the rights oi belligei
ents, or directly interfering in their behalf,
savs that he may during the present ses
sion make a further and more explicit com
munication to Congress, in the shape ot a
recommendation as to what is best for this
country to do between Spain and her col
onv. The President informs Congress that
the government long ago offered its services
to Spain as a mediator between hersclt and
Cuba, but that the otter was courteously
declined,, with thanks and an intimation
that some future time it might be accept
able and accepted. The Message, while
not Fpcakiug directly to the point, clearly
enough demonstrates why such energy lias
recently been displayed at all our naval
stations, and why all our available ships are
afloat, manned and equipped for any possi
ble emergency. As regards the Mexican
business, cattle stealing and the like, upon
the Piio Grande, the Message merely rc
cites what the country already knew.
It i3 gratifying to learn that the views
of the President upon the character of the
Centennial celebration and the propriety of
Congress voting it the appropriation asked
for by the Commissioners are those sharod
by all patriotic and intelligent Americans
For a long time it was doulted if the au
thorities at Washington recognized the
Exi)osition as both national and interna-
..... ..
tional, and their lukewarinness about it lea
many to infer that the higher authorities
were not only luuillerent out inimical to
its receiving any help lrom Congress.
Upon the subject of resumption the
President is as direct and emphatic as it is
Iossible for the very hardest money man
to be. He is not satisfied with resumption
so late as lp, but demands it not later
than January, 1877: but his diffidence
leads him to say, "I am not prepared to Kay
that I can suggest the best legislation to
secure the end most heartily commended.
Whether or not forced, premature reaump
tion "would be a srreat blessing" is at least
a mooted question, and one that will bear
much further discussion.
There are contractionists and expan
sionists. hard-money men and paper-money
men, but wc doubt if any considerable
number of either or any sort are prepared
to adopt, as wise, the President a recom
mendation to Congress to pass an amena
mcnt to the Legal-Tender act, which, after
January 1 1S77, will work virtual repudia
tion by the government of its own promises
to pay. That we may not be thought to
strain this matter we print precisely the re
commendation and the addenda to it. They
are in the words following :
There are a few measures which seem to
e important in this connection, aud which
I commend to your earest consideration.
1 repeal of so much of the Legal Tender
act as makes these notes receivable for debts
contracted after a date to be fixed in the
act itself, say not later than the 1st of
Jannan, 1S77.
" c should then have quotations at real
values, not ficttitious ones. Gold xcould no
longer be at a' premium, but currency at a
discount, a healthy reaction would set in at
once, and with it a desire to make the cur
rency equal to what it purports to be.
We do not think, that the country is pre
pared to go quite that length, even in or
der to secure a chance to resume specie
payments. The price repudiation would
be rather high, and to accept it would be
common ruin and common dishonor. The
government issued, in its time of sore dis
tress, the present greenbacks as money,
pledging its sclemn faith and credit for their
redemption, and, relying upon that pledge,
the people, in patriotic faith, took them as
money. For Congress, therefore, to so
amend the act which created them as to
force them to a discount, or to make them
of no more value than that of the paper on
which they arc printed, would be to perpe
trate a wrong without precedent.
In regard to reducing the expense of the
government, words contained in live lines
of glittering generalities cover the whole
subject ; to increasing the revenue many
lines are devoted, and a strong recommenda
tion to reimposc the obnoxious duty on tea
aud coffee, is made.
Another recommendation which demands
that all merchandise packages shall be ex
cluded from the mails, docs not seem to us
wise, r.or likely to benefit any one but the
express companies, and that at the expense
of the people.
A summary of the chief recommenda
tions of the Message the President himself
supplies as a conclusion, as follows :
As this will be the last annual 3Iessage
which I shall have the honor of transmit
ting to Congress belore my successor is
chosen I will repeat .or recapitulate the
questions which 1 deem of vital importance,
which may be legislated upon and settled
at this session :
First. That the States shall be required
to afford the opportunity of a good school
education to every child within her limits
Second, jso sectarian tenets shall ever be
taught in any school supported in whole or
m part by the State, nation or by the pro
ceeds of any tax levied upon any commun
ity. Make education compulsory so far as
to deprive all persons who cannot read aud
write from becoming voters after the year
1SU0, disfranchising none, however, on
grounds of illiteracy who may be voters at
the time this amendment takes effect.
Third. Declare Church and State for
ever separate and distinct, but each free
within their proper spheres, and that all
church property shall bear its own propor
tion of taxation.
Fourth. Drive out licensed immorality,
such as pol3Tgamy and the importation of wo
men lor illegitimate purposes, lo recur
again to the Centennial, year, it would seem
as though now, as we are to begin the se
cond centennial of national existence, would
be a most fitting time for these reforms.
Huh. .knact such laws as will insure a
speedy return to a sound currency sue has
will command the respect of the world.
Believing that these views will com
mend themselves to the great majority of
the right-thinking and patriotic citizens of
the United States, I submit the rest to
Congress.
MOODY AND S ANKEY.
Philadelphia, Dec. 7, 1875.
Dear SYr; Messrs. Moody and Sankcy
yesterday entered upon the third week of
their labors in Philadelphia, and the second
of their special effort to reach non-churh
goers and those not Christians. Dunn
the past week the weather has been very
unfavorable, being most of the time either
very cold or wet and disagreeable. Not
withstanding these drawbacks the services
nave been attended by immense numbers
otii4 nit rtA ntcikii of n nrniuntf cnt irra
even when the rain descended in torrents,
has there been less than six to eight thou
sand persons present. Tho noon-day meet
ing in the Hall has been attended daily by
from two to four thousand persona and
usually the portion of tho audience-room
tcmiwrarily partioncd off for it, has been
full. The noon meetings are conducted by
Messrs. Moody and Saukey and many of
the leading ministers and laymen take a
promineut part in them. The requests for
prayer are very numerous, two and three
hundred beiug presented almost every day,
necessitating the classing of them under
general heads. The meeting on Friday
was specially for prayer for those suffenn
from the effects of iutcmperance. Two
hundred and twenty requests, embracing a
very much larger number of individual
cases, were presented. Mr. Moody took
for his subject, Matthew, 5th chapter, the
"Three cases of incurables," and drew from
the lessous that Christ could cure any case,
and that many cases "Christ only" could
cure. Many of the cases presented for
prayer were were very touching, and while
prayer was offered for all, some called forth
specially earnest petitions. On Saturday
V W laiAU'JXV ' T H -m . w
Key. Dr. Newton, rector of Epiphany P. E
Church, having charge of the meeting and
Prof. Johnson leading the siinnnjr.
Last Sunday (December 5) was a day of
unexampled interest. At 8 A. M., in spite
of rain and the early hour. S000 people
were ready to hear words in which the
speaker seemed lost in the importance of
his theme. It was an appeal to Christians
to be a "peculiar" people, as Christ wa:
peculiar in his life and work of self-sacrifi-
cinjr
love.
At 4 p. m. a meeting for women only
was held, and the vast audience room was
crowded 2000 rose for prayer. Inquirers
flocked into the inauirv rooms on cither
side of the hall. In one Mr. Saukey labored
with a company of Christian workers, talk
ing toinquirersone, by one and in a common-
sense way following up the serious impression
made by the words they had just heard.
31r. Moody and others were hard at work
in the other inquiry-room iu a similar way.
tor these men seem to feel that in persuad
ing and "beseeching men to be reconciled
to God" it is not enough to talk to them
from the pulpit. As practical men they
see that the impression made by the public
speaker can be deepened aud prevented
from passing away by button-holing men
aud giving them to understand by personal
talk that 3'ou mean every word you have
said, and want them to got into the way of
salvation you have pointed out. I he great
thing used in the inquiry room is the Bible.
Texts like Isaiah 1:18 and 53 : 4, 5 : John
1 : 12 ; 3 : 18 and 3G : 5 : 21, arc used and
read slowly to the inquirer. For instance
Mr. Moody was talking to a young man
who said he was ready to accept Christ.
"Well," said Mr. Moody, beginning to read
John 5 : 24, aud asking at the end of each
clause, "do you accept that ?" The young
man assented each time till he reached the
words "IIatii everlasting life," when the !
young man sprang to his leet exclaiming,
"I have it! I have it! and in a few
minutes he was telling to others how simple
a thins: it was to believe.
Sunday evening the meeting was for
men only, and m tue midst ot a pelting
rain 7000 men flocked to the Hall, listened
with fixed attention, and crowded the
inquin'-rooms. At 9 p. M. Dr. McCook's
church, near by, was filled at the young
men s meeting, which is held every evening
at that hour to suit the convenience of
business men. Not till midnight had the
last inquirer left the building, so deep,
earnest, and importunate was the interest
awakcued by these solemn services. Among
the luquircrs was a youcg man who said to
the gentleman talking with him, "I have
been troubled about this subject all the
past week." "Do you think Satan has a
hand in such trouble ; was the reply.
No ! No !" "Well, if the Spirit of God has
made you anxious, he will help you now."
"Oh, I think I believe in Christ, but I
don't know what it is be 'born again.' "
At once the Christian man turned to 1
: 1, and slowly read : "Whosoever
believeth that Jesus is the Christ is born
of God." In a moment the young man
looked up with an expression of joy on his
face and said : "Then I'm saved."
During the week Mr. Moody has preach
ed from John 3: 7, "le must be born
again," and followed it with John 3 : 14 15,
"How to be born again. lhcsc sermons
were followed by one on "Grace," which
he said was posibly the least understood of
any important word, and but few Christians
really knew what grace was. He then
gave this definition : "Mercy is pity to the
miscarblc ; Grace is "love to the undeserv
ing," and enforced it by illustrations that
would not fail to fix the whole scope of the
subject upon the minds of most of his
hearers. 31 r. 31oody preached his sermon
from the text, "For the Son of man is come
to seek and to save that which was lost" by
reading a letter from a man who said, "I
have been seeking the Lord for three weeks
and have not found him ; oh ! pray for me."
The speaker said that if the writer had
been seeking Christ he would have found
him. He then gave out his text, and said
that thero has never been a man saved
except that it cost God more to save him
than him to find God. The woman who
loses a piece of silver sweeps the room until
she finds it ; she does not give it up when
she discovers the loss, but keens un tue
search until she finds what she lost. God
is always seeking those which arc lost, and
the Prince of Heaven was sent down from
heaven by God to find those which were
lost. He referred to the blind man at
Jericho whom Christ sought and healed,
and said he hoped there would be many
sinners who would sing out. "Thou Son
of David, have mercy upon me." 3Iay it
come from the depths ot your hearts, lor
Jesus of Nazareth passeth by. Tho Lord
said to the blind man "Be of good cheer,"
and then said, "What can I do for you ?
The blind man replied, "Oh ! that my sight
might bo restored," and immediately his
sight was restored. Oh ! it is likely that
poor Bartimeus eung better than 31 r
Sankcy, for he sung the song of redemp
tion. Mr. 31oody then called attention to
Zaccheus, who climbed the syeamors tree
to sec Jesus. It is not often that the rich
man makes such an effort to see Christ.
When the son of God came under the tree
the Master stopped and called him down
He expected to see Zaccheus because he
knew that he would be there, feomo are
opposed to speedy salvation. When shall
it commence ? It is likely that Zaccheus
was converted somewhere between the tree
and the ground. He then 6aid that if
man should steal oue hundred dollars from
Mr. Stuart, and the next day make restitu
tion, would vou not think that the man
waa converted? God entered b3 heart
and his conscience did not permit the man
to rest. It would be a grand thing if all
the tavern-keepers would make restitution
by giving up that which they received by
means of their hellish business. Oh ! you
can be saved if you will only come to Christ ;
he is waiting and offering you immorted
life. If there had been any other means
for the escape of the sinner, do you think
God would have given up his only Son to
die upon the cross at Calvary ? You sinners
can all find Jesus. You must come to him
as the poor prisoner who acknowledged
that he was full of sin. The Lord Jesus
is seeking for all that are lost. Won't you
try to give him your heart and to-night
become a Christian ? After the sermon a
large number arose for prayer and went
into the inquiry room.
Every evening large audiences assemble,
and the class of people in attendance show
that the interest with the masses is deepen
ing. Long before the doors are opened
large crowds gather about them, and to
prevent the crush of a crowd two additional
doors on Thirteenth and Juniper Streets
have had to be opened. It is evident a
spirit of inquiry pervades the citT, and the
crowd is not drawn simply by curisity.' The
singing of the large choir well repay the
early comers for the hour and a half of
patient waiting. On Wednesday evening j
31 r. 3Ioody announced as his text, "The
Son of man is come to seek and to save
that which was lost." He said he had not
gotten through with the subject the previous
evening, and proposed to continue it this
evening. lie said because men are lost
they need a Saviour. Don't think because
you are a sinner God does not want to have
anything to do with you. The sermon was
replete with telling incidents and Scriptural
illustrations. In the latter 3Ir. 3Ioody
I possibly excels all other, lie brings Bible
incident and scenes so vividly belore an
audience that one might almost think they
had occurred a few days ago and in a
neighboring city. The evening he spoke
of the man healed of the palsy, whose
friends let him down from the roof; the
audience were hushed in such deep stillness
that it seemed as if they could almost bear
the slow measured step of the four men as
they wended their way through the streets
of Capernaum, and, as in the narrative,
they let down their sick friend from the
roof, every one looked up to see him as he
descended. Thursday the attendance at
noon was very large, and the meeting was
intensely interesting. Oa Thursday cven-
ng the text was, "Seek ye the Lord while
le may be found ; call upon him while he
II sTT ..1 t - 1
is near. lie got tne attention oi tnc im
mense audience at once by a homely, telling
illustration, and kept it to the close. It
made a deep impression when he said you
can find Christ right here in this building
to-nirht. if vou will only seek him. Do
you believe that sinners can find Christ
here to-night, Dr. Hatfield r (lurnmg to
Dr. Hatfield.) I certainly do, said Dr.
Hatfield. Do you Dr. Smith, 3Ir. 3Ioody
continued. 31 r. Smith said that he had
no doubt of it, and 3Ir. 3Ioody said that
from the letters he is constantly receiving
he is convinced that God is striving with
many a heart in this city. Win, I wouldn't
dare even to advise you to go home to read
your Bibles aud pray. .Yok? is the accepted
time, and some of you may not even live
to get home to-night. 31 r. 31oody related
with telling effect the following personal
illustration : Iu my native village, a good
many years ago, a j'oung man started out
to seek his fortune, as we call it. Before
he left home his mother gave this text to
take with him : "Seek first the kingdom
of God and its righteousness, and all these
things shall be added unto yuu." Ihc
young man got as iar as a neign boring
village by the next Sunday (tor there were
no railroads in those days, and he had to
walk), and in the morning he went to
church, and the minister preached from
the very text his mother had given him.
In the evening he went to another church,
and there the minister preached from the
same text. Ihe words made a strong im
pression on his mind, but he was not con
verted, and after awhile lie went home
again, in tnc meantime, i leic notue ana
was converted ; and wheu I went home on
a visit I thought I would try to show him
how to seek. But when I asked my mother
whether he was still living on the old farm,
she said, in surprise : Why, didn't I write
to you about him ? He has become crazy,
and is in a lunatic asylum ; and the only
thing he says is : 'Seek first the kingdom
of God and its righteousness, and all these
things shall be added unto you.' " A short
time after that when I was home again, I
heard that he had become an idiot, and
that his parents had taken him home again.
So I went to see him, and asked him
whether he knew me. But he gave mc
only a vacant stare, and, pointing his finger
at me, said : "Young man, seek first the
kingdom of God and its righteousness, and
all these things shall be added unto you."
A few weeks ago, wheu I was home again,
I went to the old graveyard on the hill, to
see my father's grave. The chill autumn
winds rustled the dry leaves at my feet,
and as I looked down to see the last rest-
llli
place of my father, I saw there, only a
few yards away, the grave of this man.
He had put off too long.
At the close of this sermon he read the
following letter which he had received just
before he came to the meeting. The letter
had a deep black border, which told stronger
than words of death and sorrow.
"3Iy deer wife passed peacefully away
to her rest on the afternoon of the 19th
inst. after three days' illness. Her love
fur the 3Iaster and his cause increased
toward the last. It has left a terrible blank
in my house, but the knowledge that she is
with Jesus, whom she loved so to sing about ,
wonderfully softcus the blow. Heaven will
be dearer to mc than ever, because she i
there. To mc your remembrance will ever
be dear as being the means' God's hand of
bringing her to himself."
He then told of the lady's conversion,
and followed it with an invitation for those
interested to go into the inquiry-rooms,
which invitation was" accepted by a largo
number.
The young men's meeting iu the M. E.
Church, Arch and Broad Streets, from U
to 10 o'clock each evening, has continued
one of the most interesting meetings held.
It is crowded nightly, and large numbers
of j'oung men ask prayer and remain to be
conversed with, and there is good reason
to hope that a large number have given
themselves to Christ. The Parents' meet
ing in Tabernacle Presbjterian Church at
the same hour has been well attended, and
while some advanced in years have asked
prayers for themselves, most earnest
petitions go up nightly for the etaivcrsion,
of sons and daughter?.-
The singini of 31 r. Sankev continues to
charm everybody, and his part of the servico
is a special attraction, and bears home to
some, whom 31 r. 3Ioody would not reach.
the glad tidings.
Many interesting incidents have - com
under the observation of j'our corre.-ponder t ,
but he will have to keep them for another
letter. The whole city is moved, aud the

T. K. C.
In a certain Troy church yesterday, a
young man who occupied a seat near tho
pulpit was evidently greatly embarrassed
when the collection was taken, up. His
pew was about the first into which the bask
et was thrust, and he plunged his' hand in
to his pocket, kept the cdlector waiting at
moment, and then quickly thrust a bill
evidently the first he could get out of his
wallet into the basket. After the ser
vices the young man lingered, and, when
the congregation had retired, approached
the gentleman
who had charge ot tiie col-
lection, and who was
counting
it at tho
tune, and remarked that he was a stranger
in the city, that he was a poor young man
and had in the hurry of the moment put a
10 bill into the collection basket by mis
take for a $1 bill. He inquired modcstly
if it would be unfair to ask the return of
S'J to him. The collector, appreciating the
stranger's evident frankness aud modesty
looked over the collection and, finding a
10 bill, offered to return it. The stranger
declined, saying that he meant t0: contri

turned to him. This was proof positive to
the treasurer that the stranger was really
honest, and he accordingly gave him SO,
all there was in the basket, with the ex
ception of he bill, and the stranger depar
ted with many thanks and apolcgies. After
the treasurer reached home he was struck
by the appearance of the 310 bill.- He ex
amined it closely, and was satisfied that he
had been sadly victimized. It was a coun

Directors of the Poor!
The Supreme Court of the State
m a
case taken up from Berks' county,
have
iust decided that Directors of the
Poor
have no right to issue orders for donations.
Last winter the Directors' of Berks county
gave two orders, one to the Heading Dis
pensary, and one to. the Young 3Icns'
Christam Association, ot heading, for the
benefit of the poor, amounting to 425.- A
similar one to the Y. 31. C. A., was granted
to the Prison Inspectors. These order
on the County Treasurer were paid, but
when the Auditors came to pass upon the
account they refused to allow them. The
Treasurer, 3IcrkeI, appealed to tho Court
of Berks eounty where the Auditors were
sustained, the Court holding that thv
officials had no authority to grant such
orders. The Treasurer tl cn took the case
to the Supreme Court and they say the
orders paid by the Treasurer were illegal
on. their face, and therefore, brought home
notice to him of the want of authority in
the Directors of the Poor to order the?
judgment. They further intimate that the
j .... .
Directors should have been personally
charged by the Auditors and then affirm
the payment of the Court below.
"Soft-soaping" was first most effectually
applied in this country by the Swedish wo
men who defended the old (log) Swedes'
church below Philadelphia, before that city
was laid out. A friendly squaw- gave no
tice of the intended Indian attack. The
Scandinavian ladies were boiling soap, and
they at once concluded to convert the con
tents of thckettleintonruniuition of defense.
They lifted it into tho church, with fire
wood to keep it hot. As the warriors be
gan to undermine the foundations, they re
ceived on their barred backs a spirited fire
of the terrible material, which in due time
sent them howling into the wilderness.
The incident was related by a participant
who died in London at an advanced age.
She was a granddaughter of the Swedish
burgher, Sven Schule.
