Washington, Dec. 5.When the house
ommittee on appropriations gets
around to its healings on the sundry
civil appiopnation bill, the coming win
ter, there is to be a very complete in
quiry into the administration of affairs
at the government printing office, and
it is believed by members of the com
mittee who have already made investi
gations on their own hook, that the re
sult will be so startling as to bring
down upon the printery the condemna
tion o the entire country.
The inquiries thus far made seem to
show that the present administration of
Mr. Stillings, public printer, with which
printing office employees are finding so
much fault, is the only business like
and in other wa satisfactory admin
istration the printing office has had for
more than a generation. Mr. Stillings
is going forward, making careful in
vestigations into all branches of the big
office, and wherever these investiga
tions suggest it, he is issuing orders
which amount to a complete revolution
of methods. Naturallv, the employees
who are immediately affected, cry aloud,
for their particular employment is being
interfered with, but on the whole, the
figures and other results show that Mr.
Stillings is gradually putting the print
ing office on a business basis and les
eening the cost of administration at a
rate that is fairly startling. The re
duction last year was a million dollars,
as compared with the years befoie.
Criminal Use of Cash.
Recently a subcommittee from the
house appropriations committee made
an unofficial tour of the punting of
fice, and the things they saw there
point unerringly to the conclusion that
there has for years been a criminal
waste of the public money in printing
office management. A few items by
way of specification will be of interest
i\ this connection*
There was found stowed awav in one
of the unoccupied looms of the print
ing office discarded type worth $75,000
if sold as old lead. Most of this type
was in perfect condition. It represents
the discard of successive public print
ers, who seem to have had the idea that
when thev took hold it was theii duty
to abandon all the type that had been
In use, no matter what its condition,
and install type of their own.
In another part of the building the
subcommittee found more than 165,000
pounds of new type, bought ten years
?n
go, and never taken out of the boxes
which it was delivered. Why this
new type was ever bought if it was not
the purpose of the office to unpack
and use it, nobody now can tell. The
cost of this single item was many hun
dreds of thousands of dollars
The subcommittee also found among
the punting office rubbish twelve
stitching machines, formerly used in
the bindery. These machines, which
aie of a standaid make, cost $1,200
each. They were used two yeais, when
a new public printer came along and
put them aside for otheis which he for
some reason thought would do better
work. The discarded machines are as
ood as new, and can be sold at any
ime for $1,000 each. At the same
time, each year that they are permitted
to stand among the rubbish at the
printing office lessens their value. The
machines which took their places, it is
said by the employees, are not as good
as the old machines.
In going oveT the building the sub
committee found an almost unending
array of duplication of work, two and
three sets of men being employed
doing the woik that one set of men
ought to do.
The items specified above are merely
few of veiy many, and suggest to
the newspaper reader the need that
there is in the government printing of
fii of a thoio overhauling such as
Mr Stillings is now engaged m.
Tk situation has been called to the
ntUytion of Chan man Tawney of the
appropi iations committee, and he has
ananged to have all th^facts brought
out when the comimtfe
sundry civil appropi
facts will be pubhs,
and will be ciieulatet,
i?ed labor centers, fof
that when the government .gets ready
to back Mr Stillings up and tell him to
go the full limit in putting the printing
office on a proper business basis, there
will be a howl from the employees wio
will be affected that will make itself i
heard in the hall of every organized
labor union in the United States. The
trouble which Mr. Stillings has already
had in his work of reform is merely a
piomise of what is to come, should his
work continue to a logical conclusion.

Cost Million a Year.
An estimate, made this week by one
of the most careful men. congress,
is that mismanagement, resulting in ex
tiavagance and all sorts of criminal
waste, has cost the government, the
past fifteen years, more than $15,000,-
000. This waste *was in full swing
when Mr. Stillings became public print
ci. and it was the understanding before
he received his commission that it was
to be his principal duty to see that the
administration was made economical
snd of a character to repel fair criti
cism. Mr. Stillings took hold, deter
mined to carry out his instructions, and
befoie he had been in office a month
the trouble began. He has been hauled
over the coals scores of times by the
Washington newspapers, which seem to
be under the influence of the labor un
ions, and repeated efforts have been
made to convince the country that his
administration was a failure and he
himself an ignoramus in printing office
matteis. But Stillings has kept at
work, along the lines originally laid
put, and now that he is to have the
loyal support of Chairman Tawney and
the great committee on appropriations
o the house of representatives, it be
gins to look as if the reforms in which
ted would be carried out.

has been somewhat deficient in' tact.

Washington, Dec. 5.The interstate
commerce commission has fixed Mon
day, Dec. 17, as the date for beginning
the car shortage hearing in Minne
apolis.
Commissioner Lane will be one of the
members of the commission to conduct
the hearings and probably Commission
er Harlan will be another, altho the
conclusion in Mr Harlan's case may
possibly be reconsidered.
Whether more than these two are to
go has not been determined, but it is
believed that two will be sufficient.
John H. Marble, attorney for the com
mission, will start west next Sunday,
stopping a few days in Chicago on
business, and reaching Minneapolis the
middle of next week.
It will be his purpose to collate all
evidence that is available in time for
its piesentation to commissioners on
the 17th. No guess can be made re
garding the length of the hearings.
Commissioner Lane said again this
morning that the hearings would go to
the bottom of the trouble.
It develops today that the com
mission, should hearings warrant
such a course, will report to con
gress, making recommendations for
legislation.

Interstate Commission Sets Date for In-

Lake Navigation Extended.
Publicity Brings Results
With only ten days of publicity devoted by Th Journal to the
failure of the railroads to move out this year's crops from a portion of
North Dakota, results have been important.
Receipts show a disposition on the part of the roads to make an effort
1
Not only has the interstate commerce commission promised a speedy
investigation, but it has already sent half a dozen experts into the con-
gested territory to get information on conditions at first hand.
There is every assurance thataside from whatever relief may be
afforded this yearit will be impossible to have a repetition of such con-
ditions in years to come.
On the eve of the inquiry it may be in order to define the situation
more sharply by reiterating the statement that the size of the northwest
crop is not a factor in the situation in any way. Many grain growers,
particularly in northern and northeastern North Dakota, hauled their grain
to the elevators because they wished to use the nncome from it. This
grain was allowed to accumulate till the elevators were all full and the
grain was piled up on the ground. The railroads would not move it and the
ordinary current of business was blocked.
Thus the only part of the crop at issue is that portion which the pro-
ducers have already tried to sell. The fact that they have been subjected
to hardship thru the railroads' attitude is the basis of the coming inquiry.
Today's receipts of grain in Minneapolis were 301 cars as against 185
a year ago Duluth received 228 cars as against 29. The rush to Duluth is
due to a decision to keep lake navigation going another week.

New York Broker Wakes to Peer into
Two Revolvers.
iNew York, Dec. 5.Awakened by
the sound -of a stealthy footstep in his
home' jn I}ast Sixty-third street, Elias
Asiel,, a broker, found himself con
fronted with two revolvers held only a
few inches from his face.
"We'll shoot if you make a
squeak," said a voice as the men be
hind the guns began to draw slowly
away toward the door of the room. Mr.
Asiel did not heed the warning, but
raising himself on his elbow raised a
shout for help.
In an instant the two men were upon
him raining blows upon his head, and
when a servant who had heard the cries
rushed into the room the broker was
lying helpless on the verge of insensi
bility, his pillow soaked with blood.
The robbers had escaped. A dozen
pearl and sapphire stick pins and some
silver articles were taken.

Represetative Marshall arrived in

found that the commission had already

McCumber and Hansbrough got busy
at about the same time, all of them un
der the impelling cause of protests
from home and a personal knowledge
of the situation. The most that their
work did was to confirm the commis

Senator McCumber has made several
visits to the commission's offices, and
so has Senator Hansbrough, and in ad

Wonderful Strides of Minnesota

Windy City.
Special to The Journal.
Chicago, Dec. 5.After one of the
most spirited and sensational campaigns
in the history of the Board of Trade
the rule raising the commission on
grain transactions from one-eighth of a
cent to one-quarter of a cent a bushel
has been repealed by a vote df almost
two to one. A previous effort at re
peal was lost, three months ago, by a
vote of 6 to l.
It was freely predicted that reten
tion of the rule which had doubled the
commission rate would split Chicago's
speculative center,
It is admitted that the wonderful
strides of Minneapolis are responsible
for the complexion of the vote, whicl} is
regarded as an imperative action in
self-defense. Whether this will stem
the tide, cannot be said, but it is said
that to have raised the commission
probably would have spelt ruin.
Members from Duluth, St. Louis, Min
neapolis and other cities came in to
vote, as authorized by their member
ships on the Chicago board, and the
outsiders were prominent in the fight.
The balloting resulted as follows:
Affirmatives, 566 negative,* 277. The
motion that firms be allowed to place
their floor men on salaries instead of
on brokerage commissions was also
voted on favorably, the ballot stand
ing, affirmative 545, .negative 394.

Rumors that She Will "Appear" Are
Not Generally Credited,
Spec.al to The Journal.
New York, Dec. 5.The report that
Ida Tarbell was thinking of going on
the stage has caused some amusement
in literary and dramatic circles, but is
quite generally regarded as more or
less of a canard. Miss Tarbell has ex
pressed interest in the dramatization
of some of the "muckraking'' stories
and it is thought that she may possi
bly have a hand in this work. That
she will go on the stage is not seri
ously believed by the majority of
critics, tho it is quite generally ac
knowledged that she would be a good
drawing card for some astute manager.

Problem.
Washington, Dec. 5.Business was
heavy in the senate todav. It was
practically the first opportunity sena
tors have had to introduce petitions,
memorials, bills and resolutions, and
many such were presented.
After a debate, the senate postponed
until tomorrow the consideration of
resolutions calling for information re
garding the discharge of the negro
troops of the Twenty-fifth infantry, for
merly stationed at Brownsville, Tex.
The delay was caused bv the absence
from the city of Senator Penrose.
Without debate the senate adopted
a resolution calling on the secretary
of commerce and labor to furnish the
senate copies of all official letters, tele
grams, reports, etc., fijed in the depart
ment in connection with the investiga
tion of the matter of the Japanese at
tending the public schools of San Fran
cisco. The resolution was presented
by Senator Flint of California.
Sends Special Message*.
The president today sent a special
message to congress urging legislation
giving the executive authority, upon
his own initiative and responsibility, to
dismiss any officer whom he thinks un
worthy to remain in the service. The
law at present provides that in time of
peace no officer shall be dismissed ex
cept in pursuance of a courtmartial or
in mitigation thereof. This provisifin
the president wants repealed.
Illustrating the necessity for the
legislation desired, the president cites
the case of a naval officer, whose name
is not given, but who was aeeused of
"indecent and disgusting behavior."
He was convicted, but the court, to his
surprise, the president says, did not
sentence him to dismissal.
Baps at Child Labor.
Senator Lodge today introduced a
bill designed to prevent the employ
ment of child labor by prohibiting in

the production of which a child un

for one year.

GUT ON LUMBER,
COAL AND GRAIN
Railroad Commission Will Make
Another Reduction Order on
Commodity Tariffs.
Commoditiy rates in Minnesota are
going to be reduced, as a result of the
hearings just finished. There is every
indication that the question now being
considered by the state railroad com
missioners is not one og "shall there
be a reduction?" This question is al
ready decided in the affirmative in
their minds, and the real issue is, how
great shall the reduction be, and on
what commodities
The answer will probably be in part
a reduction on grain, to apply in addi
tion to the one voluntarily made by
teh roads and additional cuts on coal
and lumber.
The hearing developed some facts
which the railroad officials could not,
and indeed in many instances* did* not
even attempt, to controvert. One of
the most persistent was the fact that
rates on lines between the twin cities
and Chicago are much cheaper on all
commodities than they are for* equal
mileage on the roads extending' west
from the twin cities. Railroad'"men
tried to offset this undeniable evidence^
by a statement that the bulk of busi
ness is so great on the Chicago-twin
city business as to permit of lower
rates. But in the face of this state
ment the railroad men had to admit
that business on the western lines is
now so tremendous that the roads can
not begin to get a sufficient number of
cars to take care of it.
Large Surplus a Factor.
Another important piece of evidence
developed, was the fact that roads have
been so prosperous for a number of
years past that they are accumulating
great piles" of surplus money out of
the rates now in effect. The Great
Northern alone admitted to the poses
sion of a present surplus of $23,000,000.
It also seemed evident that the rail
road companies were building new lines
out of this surplus money. Or, in other
words, that the shippers of the north
west were paying to the roads such an
excess profit in freight rates that this
profit is being constantly used for the
building of road extensions and perma
nent improvements and betterments,
without the company finding it neces
sary to invest new caiptal to any great
extent. This point was strenuously de
nied by James J. Hill, who said that
all extensions and betterments came
out of new capital, and naturally his
subordinates on the- Great Northern
and Northern Pacific testified in the
same vein. But the Minneapolis &
St. Louis road seemed to freely admit
the point, and the facts in evidence
seemed to prove it in, spite of denials
by road officials.
Fewer Empties Moved,
A twint which will probably have
weight was the fact that the carrying
of "empties'' by western roads is on
the decrease. In earlier years, when
the foaffic was all going one way, from
the west eastward, the rate charged

Journal Special Service.
San Francisco, Dec. 5.President
Roosevelt's denunciation of Califor
nia's anti-Japanese attitude has aroused
bitter resentment here.
The president is excoriated for his
threat to use troops, and he openly is
charged with deliberately misstating
the position taken by the authorities
of this city and the state.
The Chronicle today has a vigorous
editorial declaring that the president
has overstepped his authority in threat
ening to coerce San Francisco. It says:
"The president says 'to shut out Jap
anese from public schools is a wicked
absurdity.' They are not shut out from
the public schools. The president de
mands more power 'to enforce the
rights of aliens under treaties.' The
context shows that his assumption is
that the Japanese have a treaty right
to enter our schools. There is no basis
of fact for that assumption.
Ridicules Naturalization.
"He recommends that the Japanese!
be by special law admitted to natural
^ahon. That is a proposition to be
ridiculed. Its natural effect must b
to cause a Japanese exclusion act to be
pressed.
"He says that in the matter of the
exclusion of Japanese pupils: 'AH of
the forces, military and civil, of the
United Stages, which I may lawfully
employ, will be so employed.' This is
an implied threat to use military force
to put Japanese children into our
schools when he well knows he has no
authority to do anything of the kind,
and that any such attempt could only
lead to his own impeachment."
The Daily Call's editorial says:
"The president appears to beg tho
question when he says in his message
concerning the treatment of the Jap
anese San Francisco, 'not only must
we treat all nations fairly, but w must
treat with justice and good will all
immigrants who come here under the
law.'
Threat to Bolt Party.
"Japanese immigrants are not treat
ed with injustice in San Franciseo
They are given an education free of
charge in our public schools, but be*
cause they are mostly adillt students
they are segregated in a special school,
mere is nothing unfair or lacking in
good will in that."
.Should force be used, the Calif or
mans declare thev will not weaken,
and while they may have to bow for
the time being to federal dictation,
thev will withdraw all the white chil
dren from the rjublic schools and leave
them sole possession of the Japan
ese.
.Open threats are made that Califor
nia will be turned to the democratic
column the next election, the cam
paign slogan to be: 'The democratic
party is a white man's party."
There also has arisen another feature
bitter, open resentment against Ben
jamin Ide Wheeler, president of the
University of California. Tn President
.Roosevelt's message Californians de
clare they recognize the words and sen*
timents of the head of the state unit
versity and against him, rather than
against either Eoosevelt or the feder
al government, was directed the greate*
part of the wrath of San Francisco
Angry men declared Wheeler had tak*
