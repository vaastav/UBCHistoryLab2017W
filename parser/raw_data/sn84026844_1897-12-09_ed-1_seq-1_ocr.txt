WASHINGTON, D. C.. Dec. S.-Whei
the general appropriation bill comen be
fore the house, as It Is expected will oc
cur in-morrow, u motion will be mn<l
to strike out the Item providing for tfy
maintenance of the civil service com
mission. This will be supported b;
men who are not In favor of the aboil
tion of the law, but who feel that the;
I .refer even that to a continuance of j
system that has become, In their Judg
inent, a farce, so far as the original In
tent and proper application of clvl
eervlce principles are concernod.
The motion to strike out will recelvi
it hearty vote, which will not be wholl;
Republican. Democrats are just a
much opposed to the present status o
affairs as are the Republicans, but be
lug In the minority they have not th
fame reason for aggressiveness. Ye
they want to see some action taken
looking to a modification of th?- !tw.
Five Democratic representatives ant
0:1- Republican formed a group to-nlgh
nt a hotel where many representative
and several sena^irs are domiciled
Tiisix were In favor of modification
but If not that, then repeal.
Representative Miller, of West Vir
filnla. said to-night that he would vol
to strike out the appropriation shouli
I the motion be made. He will do so, no
as an enemy of civil service, but as hi
! opponent of the law as It will be admin
litered. Mr. Miller believes there at
lasses of public servants who shouli
Jbo protected by a rigid law, not fo
their ownselves but for the (food of thi
service. In this class he Includes thos
who are engaged in intricate work, am
to displace whom with inexperience
persons, would be detrimental to th
public interests. Tie also Includes pos
Ml clerks, onil would not object to oth
er branches which he did not take tim
to enumerate. He Is of the opinion
however, that if the law cannot be re
stored to its original purpose It woult
be better be repealed.
Mr. Miller speaks hopefully of Re
publican prospects, and of busines
conditions. Ills committee work ha
not yet been Inaugurated, and he Is do
votlnar his attention to the Interests 0
liis constituents as the opportunltlc
present.
It In stated to-night that all of thi
appropriation Mils are well advanced
It Is expected that Mr. Dlngley wll
present one to-morrow, and that Mi
Cannon will add the one he bus churg
of within a few days.

MINNEAPOLIS, Minn., Dec. 8.?The
e Journal prints to-day what it claims to
be the Inside of the Armour wheat deal
. and explanation of the clash between
. that astute operator and the Chicago
bull clique. The latter Is said to be
much stronger than was supposed. It
has developed that L. Z. Lelter la one
of the principals in the bull clique, and
that George H. French is the actlvc
manager of Its interests. The clique
i views with composer the Armour plan
- of buying wheat in the Minneapolis
. market and shipping It to Chicago and
delivering It under contract so late In
F; December that the freezing of the river
- will prevent Its shipment fast. It is sup
posed that Armour expeoted thus to ?*. v
cure the storage of a large share of
I'hn u'h?.'it fi?r hl?t rhli'Hirii . li'Uiitni'S
until spring.
f It will come as a genuine surprise tu
i the trade to learn that the clique fat
_ from permitting the wheat to remain
li? storage nil winter, will ship It all
by rail to the east, where it has already
1 engaged Boston and New York tonnage
for Europe. In this way the December
e wheat will be eliminated from the situation.
The Journal asserts that the
^ bull clique is engineering no artificial
a corner and will try to squeezo no one,
I The clique believe that u legitimate advance
is inevitable In May and Is act"
lug on that theory.
The supposition In the Minneapolis
1 contract will gradually ?nd Its way In1
to Chicago. _

CANTON. O., Dec. I.?All day* the 1

were near her bedside, watching *or l

SPANISH VIEWS

lie Very Knltafactory.
MADRID, Dec. 8.?Premier Sagasta,
? an Interview regarding President Me;inley'?
message to the United States
ongress, is quoted as saying he thinks
10 message satisfactory, "because the
irent to Intervene in Cuba was made
lerely to give satisfaction to a portion
f American opinion without the Intenon
of executing It."
Continuing the premier said that the
overnment would not make a declaraioii
on the BUbJect. He believed the
resident's words would have Influence
1th the Insurgents, and added that the
Dries would not be convoked until the
overnment had ascertained the effect
f the message upon the United States
ongrrpH.
The friendliness of the message suriu<ned
the most sanguine expectations
f the friends of the government. Thero
i luud praise for President MoKlnley in
fllclal and political circles for having,
s they say, thus cleared the way for
fair trial of the new colonial policy
i tin* Wr?ni Trunin, which will naturallv
squire time. ,
The Spanish liberals arc particularly ,
leased with the Presided tVarguments t
gainst recognition of the belligerency
r the Cubans, and the Implicit reputation
of recognition of belligerency,
nnexatlon of the island or extreme Inreference
with the right# of Spain In
uba. They are equally delighted with
hat part of the message recognizing 1
ow quickly and completely they had
eversed the Canovas-Weyler policy, '

leasurcs.
Outside of ofllclnl circles satisfaction *
? very visible In financial circles and 4
lso of the general public. i
La Correspondencia de Espann, the <
Olclal organ, says that after rellectlon, <
Spanish opinion on President McKln- I
;y's message to thn United States con- i
ress Is less optimistic than at first, it '
roceeds to Impugn the sincerity of the 1
'resident's protestation of friendship for
Ipalr. nnd of respect for International
bllgutlon, but It admits that the incs- j
age was "addressed to congress prlnIpally
and In language, which, alhough
not intended to please Spain,
rill annoy Jingoes and filibuster*." '

MADRID, Dfx.-. 8?El Liberal fays, in 1
ommentlng on President McKinley's j
lessage: 1
"It is more favorable to Spain than
resident Cleveland's message because <
recognizes Spain's Intention to enthu- <
lastlcally labor to establish peace in t
fuba."
Tlio ministerial EI Globo praises Proslent
McKlnley's message.
The Socialist Republican El Pals averts
that thi! message la "shameful, as
implied the moral bankruptcy or the
vonarchy."
The Republican I'rogesso take* the
rouml that tho message Is u "great huilllatlon."
The Imparclal, commenting on th/*
lessage, nays: "It shows a certain clevmess
and evil Intention. Again it red's
to filibustering expeditions. Mo.
tlnley speaks with what appears to bo
xeessivo cynicism to those who havo
ot lost all notion of Justice. This p?vrnment
must show the Yankee* that

lint they havo yet to tear it down." ]
In conclusion the Imparclal remark*:

Tint Case of tlia Klml on ltccerd,
PITTSBURGH. Pa., Doc. 8.?The excutlon
of the negro Philip Hill, whlcli1
k'ua net for to-day, hub been postp?^eii
ndeflnltely. Falling to hear favorably
rem Governor Hastings upon the np
illcatlon of Hill's mother for a respite, '
lis attorney took out a writ of error to
he ^Iflireme court this morning, and i
ipon the advice of counsel that the ap*eal
acted as%uperiedcas and stopped

ourt decision, Sheriff Lowry postponed
lie execution. Tho writ of error to reurnable
October 1. next. Hill was eonIctcd
of the murder of George Law- 1
ence, u railroad laboring boes.
The postponement of Hill's execution
ind the turn the matter has tuken, has
rented a sensation among the legal
raternlty and bids fulr to bring about
t eonlllet between the state supreme
ourt and the constitution. The case Is
aid to be the first of the kind en reord
in this state and probably has no
larallel in any other. According to the
tplnlon of many of the leading metnlers
of the legal fraternity. Hill cannot
low be hanged and the following decaratlon
made by George H. Kane, one
>f the young members of the Allegheny
ounty bar, who acted as Hill's counsel,
s supported by several Judges as well
is lawyers. Mr. Kane says:
"Philip Hill Is legally dead; we shall
isk for a writ of habeas corpus to have
ds body turned over to his friends, and
f necessary, will take the case througn
he supreme court of the United States.
Phe writ of error as we notified Goverlor
Hastings, should not have acted aH
. Himnrnprions or stav of execution tin
lor the act of 1S97, anil ho is regarded
? the law, as I see It, an dead.
"Governor Hastings set the date of
IiM's execution as December 8, between
he hours of 10 n. m. and II p. m. and
efused to grout IIIIl a respite or Inter'ere.with
the execution, unci as the law
Hands, the sheriff was therefore obllg?d
io execute him according 'to the
erms of the governor's warrant; and,
lot having done so. Hill, In law, is
herefore legally dead and HHPs people
ire entitled to the bod*'.
"The governor has no power, nor any
ithcrofflcerof the state or judge thereof.
;o set another dute for the execution. If
his be the law Hill Is therefore entiled
to go free."
Habeas corpus proceedings Tor the
possession of Hill's body will be instltu:ed
at once.
The postponement of the execution by
he writ of error in something unheard
>f In this state before. It is almost exictly
a parallel ease to tlint of Theolore
Durrant, the San Francisco murlerer,
whose execution was prevented
jy the same sort of an upplleatlon, but,
iccording to the Iuws of Californfa, the
iherlff can fix the date for the bunging
ilmseif, afterwards.
DURRANI'S LAST HOPE
Xipcllril by (lie DcrUlou of the Supreme
Court of Cnllforiiln.
SAN FUANCISCO, Dec. 8.-Late this
ifternoon the supreme court dispelled
he last hope of W. H. T. Durrant, the

ind Minnie Williams, by disposing of
I.. nnnunlo in n BltmmfLPV milJlllpr.
In a written opinion from the pen of
ZJhlef Justice Beatty, which is concurred
In by all but one of his assoclitcs,
tho court afllrmi* the Judgment of
Judge liahers In remanding the prlsjner
to San Quentin until the date set
,'or his execution, but reverses the uenencing
of Durrant to bo hanged on N6,'ember
It, and remands the case to the
luperior court with Instructions to act
iccordlngly.
Ah the rcmlttur was ordered Issued
forthwith, and the court holds that execution
can only be stayed now by the
.<:?uance of a certificate of probable
:aut>e, It only remains to re-sentenco
I he condemned murderer, which will
irobably be done to-morrow.
Justice Garoutte alone dissented from
this opinion, maintaining that Durrant's
appeal should have been dismissed.
as the time required by law for
their perfection has been allowed to
lapse.
