Judge George Kunkel, Jury Commis

History is unusually shy of infor
mation as to earlier years of the old
wheel. Other than the fact that it is
the first that ever did duty in the
county, very little is definitely known
of it. That it did serve to hold trie
names of some 63.000 jurors, many of
whom have become prominent in the
social, civic and business life of the
city and county, goes without saying.
Furthermore, it served in Civil War
days for conscript duty.

Secretary Says Forces Should Be
Raised to Full War
Strength
Special to The Telegraph
■Washington, Dec. 10. —The report
of Secretary Ga ison, presented to
| the President tc-duy. shows that the
■head of the War Department is not In
altogether at agrement with his chief
upon the subject of military
j paredness. Tn the executive message
of yesterday President Wilson said:
"We must depend in every time of na
-1 tional peril in the future as in the
! past, not upon a standing army, nor
; yet upon a reserve army, but upon a
citizenry trained and accustomed to
! arms."
Secretary Qanrison recommends that
| the army be increased immediately by
| the enlistment of 25.0U0 additional
I men and by the appointment of 1,000
I officers, saying, "We would then be
I able to undertake the next nevesslty,
! which is absolutely imperative of a
! reserve."
! Indeed, the strengthening of the
| standing army by virtually doubling
: available force fo rservice in Contin
ental United States, an dthe creation
I of a reserve army which would insure
j 500,000 trained and acpable men for
I duty in the first line should military
, operations become necessary, is the
I dominant note of the report. The
' document .without being in any sense
Jingoistic, is militant throughout,
j The addition of 25.000 men would
bring the army up to its full war
j strength of 120,000 men, 50,000 of
I whom would ve available at home. At
j presnt the mobile strength is 31,000,
I which is soon to be cut in two by de
! tachrm-nts to service in the Canal
i Zone. Hawaii and the Philippine Is
i lands.
Refers to European War
I The report mentions the European
war once, the Secretary saying that it
would be premature to attempt to
I draw any lessons from the operations
at this time.

$650,000 CHRISTMAS GIFT
10.000 Employes of Crane Co.. Chi
cago. Will Share Disbursement 1
Special to The Telegraph
Chicago, 111., Dec. 10.—Ten thou
sand employes of the Crane Company
w|ll~share in a $650,000 Christmas
gift this year as a partial recompense
for the shrinkage in wages that re
sulted from lost time'in the last year,
according to an announcement by R.
T. Crane. 3d, to-day.
"Business all over tJie country has
been much depressed this year, espec
ially since the beginning of the war,
and It has been difficult to keep the
manufacturing plants running even
on short time," a statement by the
board of directors said.
"While the Crane Company kept
its full working force, it was neces
sary to shorten the hours, and this
resulted in a serious shrinking in the
men's wages—a condition which was
regretted, but could not be avoided,
as no market could be found for the
quantity of product urned out when
running to capacity."

1907, he moved his stock to 30 North

formal opening, and from now on the
plan of the c mpnny is to handle player
pianos, pianos and viotrolas. The firm
is Central Pennsylvania agent for the
Steinway pianos and the C. M. Sigler
piano-player action, which can be put
in any piano to give it a player move
ment.
Five booths have been made for the
demonstration of victrolas, and the en
tire store has been remodeled. An en

How to Rid the Skin
of Objectionable Hairs
(Aids to Beauty)
A simplified method is here given
for the quick removal of hairy or fuzzy
growths und rarely is more than one
treatment required: Mix a stiff paste
with some powdered delatone and
water, apply to hairy surface and after
2 or 3 minutes rub off, wash the skin
and every hair has vanished. This
simple treatment cannot cause injury,
but care should be exercised to get
real delatone.—Advertisement.
MOIH CMING IN
FOR BELGIMi FUNDS
Suggestion That the Need For Con
tribntions Has Only Com
menced in the Struggle
The Telegraph will continue to re
ceive money for the Belgian relief
funds. Numerous letters have been
received asking if It will still forward
cash and the point is made by one
writer that the relief work is not of
a temporary character, but must be
permanent and that people should give
weekly or monthly.
The St. Stephen's Guild, through
Jane B. Donaldson, treasurer, has sent
$25, which has been forwarded to the
committee In charge at Philadelphia
and $8.61 from the Church of the Na
tivity a Newport, the proceeds of a
special collection, has also been for
warded.
The Philadelphia Belgian relief
committee urges that renewed effort
be made owing to the terrible condi
tions prevailing.
