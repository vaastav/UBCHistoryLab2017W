to us of this character which shows a
very marked improvement In this re
spect over that of former years A
large majority of cases considered by
us was for the sale of intoxicating
liquors by tho colored element in this
county and we feel assured that by
the continual and commendable vigi
lance of the officers of the county and
the rapidly growing sentiment of the
law abiding element of our people
that this traffic will before many
months have passed be so checked as
to cause this county to take Its stand
as one that really respects the law
and desires Its strict enforcement
President Roosevelts
Porto Rico Message
The message of President Roosevelt
on Porto Rico which was submitted to
the Senate and House of representa
tives yesterday Will be pleasing to
the groat majority of United States
citizens in that it shows that at least
one of our Island possessions is rapid
ly forging toward tho goal of absolute I
self goYcrnment and that the people
are beginning at least to appreciate i
tho liberty which is guaranteed to i
every citizen who lives under the
Stars and Stripes
1 The president calls attention to the
necessity pf dredging the harbor at
San Juan and It would seem that this
is a matter that should receive the
prompt attention of congress The
island of Porto Rico is extremely
valuable and its principal port should
be of sufficient depth to a COD1m
date the commerce of the Island
which Is constantly growing and will
I continue to gfov for many years to
comq <
j The great progress that Porto Rico
hasimade since Us annexation 19 the
jUnlted States is in great measure
i undoubtedly due to the fact that tho
I work of educating the people has been
carried on in the most approved man
I ner Primary education especially
1 has received great attention and this
thus guarantee that corning genera
i tions of Porto RIcan natives will fully
1m l
r o 1 < J > c
appreciate the liberties of a republi
can form of government
The president indicates that the
time has come when it is desirable
to confer the full rights of American
citisjenahiD upon the people of Porto
Rico and he requests that suitable
action be taken by congress to this
end Porto Ricans unlike the inhabi
tants of the Philippine islands have
never been troublesome and it Is no
more than right that citizenship
should be conferred upon them Of
course as the president says It would
not be wise for the United States gov
ernment to relinquish all power in the
I island but it can be done to such an
extent that the mailed hand will not
be noticed beneath the velvet glove of
paternalism I I
The suggestion pf the president i
that all the Insular governments I
should be placed under one oureau is
a good one Conditions as regards
I the government of these possessions
are practically he same and the ad
ministration of all our outlying colo
nies if they may be so called would
be less complicated if they were all
under one head
No Object in t I
Mud Slinging I I
The Mobile Item lets out what itis
pleased to term a Mighty Wail over
an alleged report that has been sent
out regarding Ute depth of water in
the channel over the bar at the en
i trance to Mobile bayant without giv
ing its authority for the statement re
marks
Within the past few days the re
ports have been thoroughly discussed
shipping and bUsiness circles in
general and have been denounced in
strong terms Prominent Mobilians
discussing matter today said that
the reports eminated from interests
Identified with Pensacola and that
while the false reports of the condi
tions of the channel htd worked dam
age to some extent they had been
proved untrue by official reports of
the soundings made on the recent trip
and which are now in the hands of
the proper authorities at Washington
The statement was made that the re
ports had been sent out for the pur
pose of advancing the interests of
Pensacola The reports are to he
more thoroughly discussed at a meet
ing to be held in the very near fu
ture
The Journal does not believe that
any interests identified with Pensa
cola are responsible for any deroga
tory remarks about the Mobile chan
nel and will not believe it until the
parties who are alleged to have made
the remarks are name4 awl proven
guilty
Pensacola has the finest harboj on
the gulf coast and that fact has never
been questioned This being the case
it is hard to see what could be gained
by mud slinging with reference to I
Mobiles inferior advantages
