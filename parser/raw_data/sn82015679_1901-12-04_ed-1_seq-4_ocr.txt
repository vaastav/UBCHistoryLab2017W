It has been often remarked that respon

tend an answer In his message. ;
It Is to be hoped the proposed annexa-
tion of Irvington will be considered with j
reference to the interests of all concerned

view. Incidentally, it may be remarked (
that Indianapolis is already a city of pretty
magnificent distances, and that miles and '

The suit about to be begun in the United

of view it will bo ii battle of giants, and
jnay result in settling important princi
ples. Although Indiana has furnished one Pres

The estimates submitted by the secretary
of the treasury of appropriations required

The estimates are prepared by the hads
of the several dpai trnont ai.d are sub
mitted to CongTets by the secretary of the
treasury without change. It is for t'on
sress to decide whether they arc reason
able, necessary or exccF-ivi. The headä cf
. departments almost invariably make romo
their subordinate?, but the tendency 13 al
vays towards some Increase of expendi
tures as being necessary to the efficiency
f the service.
In a grrowlns government
this consideration is entitled to due weight,
but as economy must besin pomewtiere and
t'ometime Coi;grc?s should always scruti
nize the estimates very clo.-ely and hold
thrni down to the lowest lisures compat
ible with a proper administration of the
Government For the year ending June 00.
i, they amount in the aggregate to $510,

estimates for l-2 and I l.OOO.O'O more than

iuetions, however, are offset by increased

which may be necessary, but all of which

President Itoosevelt's Xirst annual mes
sage is also Ids inaugural address in that
it is the Ilr?.t official sprtsIon cf his
views concerning national affairs and
Issues. It is remarkable for its departure
from' all previous messages in Ignoring
dry facts and figures:, for the high stand
it takes in considering national policies
and duties, and for the direct and cour
ageous manner in which it treats public
questions. In all these respects it is char
acteristic. The American people have come
to regard President Itoosevelt as a peculiar
type of character, a man of his own kind
with high ideal3 and strong convictions,
an American of the class who, to use an
expression of his own, have "the lift of
lofty purpose'' that comes from a true j
appreciation of our national origin and !
destiny. The message sustains and con
liims tliis view of him. From a literary
point of view it is quite beyond criticism,
as might be expected from a man of the
President's scholarly attainments and prac-
,
tical literary training. Next to the excel
lence of its literary form and expression is
its freedom from perf unctoriness as shown
in the entire absence of the dry facts and
figures usually contained in the recapitu-
lation of department reports. Of this there i
is. almost nothing at all. The most im
portant of all department reports, that of
the treasury, is barely alluded to, and
the salient features of others arc treated
from the President's own point of view and
in his own lanuuatre without reoeatintr
. t , . , , . , , . . -us-
that of his heads of department. This
. . . . .. ,., . . 4.
again is characteristic But perhaps the
. ,
most characteristic feature of the message
is the atmosphere of pure patriotism and
aggressive Americanism that pervades it,
and the clear conception it shows of the
manifest destiny of the United States and
the ability and purpose as well as the duty
of tho American people to work out to their
last results every problem presented to
them. In this respect the message is
unique. No I 'resident has ever dealt with
large questions and policies in .a larger
way. "Without disrespect to the chief ex
ecutive it might be said he deals with them
in a Itooscveltian way. There is no dan
ger of the message being mistaken for that
of anybody but Theodore Iloosevelt. It Is
the heart-to-heart and mind-to-mind mes
sage of a great American addressing his
countrymen on topics of great concern and
enterprises of pith and moment affecting
the future destiny and welfare of the coun
try, regarding which he feels that his own
sincere convictions aro entitled to recipro
cal sincerity on the part ot his country-i
men. I'roni beginning to end the message
i an expression of profound belief in re
publican government and methods, and of
unshakable faith in the mission intrusted
to this Republic in solving the great prob
lems of the present and future; above all
j else, it is an Inspiring call for increased
efficiency in government and the best
things attainable in national life. The
American citizen who cannot feel pride,
even exultation, in the utterances of the
President must either be a very dull man
j or lacking in that patriotism that is the
I foundation stone of all good and lasting
j government. It will be read v.ith keenest
Interest and approval by millions cf Amer
icans, and is certain to attract much at
tention abroad.
A l'EW POINTS IX THE ME 3 SAUK.
The President gives his views regarding
the questions which are attracting most at
tention with candor and intelligence. Tako
j the subject of trusts. He does not rail at
t tho combinations of capital in production as
j evils to bo got rid of, even if the business
i of the country should be paralyzed as the
! result, but as the results of natural condl-
tions with which the tariff has nothing to
j do. He boldly declares that euch combina
i tlons are useful to the whole country unless
nicy me ciiiiHoeu iu uaiui'ci mo iieeuom
of trade. His remedy is publicity and the
eral government in regard to combinations
doing business In more than one State ho
urges tho creation of a department of in
dustry and commerce. Has any one a bet
ter suggestion to make than this? He sets
forth the relations between the people and
corporations clearly, and upon these rela-
tions he bases the right of government to
exercise control to an extent that they shall
not inflict injury upon the people who have
given them life.
The President's treatment of all the
topics relating to labor and industrial in
terests is upon a high plane. The hope cf
the country is in the betterment of all the
people. To that end legislation should be
directed. As an American he is proud to
declare that the American people lead the
world in intelllrence and ln nossessimr the
. . 1.11,,,
means of procuring a high standard of liv- i
, i
Inc. As an American he is desirous that,
tho standard of intelligence and of civiliza-
tion shall be advanced. He is opposed not
only to Chinese immigration but to the im
migration of all other foreigners who can
not adopt the standard of American living.
He would shut out all labor that Is accus
tomed to a lower scale of living than that
of the American wage earner. In the judg
ment of the President it is a crime against
American civilization and progress to dis
place American labor by foreign labor be
cause It is cheaper.
No part of the President's treatment of
economic questions shows a clearer Insight
Into industrial conditions than what he
says iu regard to reciprocity. When he de
clares that "reciprocity is tho har dmaiden
of protection" be states a truth which the
free-traders who are now shouting the
praises of reciprocity fail to comprehend.
Reciprocity, to free-traders, is flrnply en
indirect method -of getting the competing
products of other countries into the United
States, and they are indifferent to the fact
that the product of every foreign daj-'s la
bor sold In this country takes a daj-'s labor
from work people in the same industry in
the United States. In the Judgment of the
President that Is not reciprocity which en
ables the products of foreign factories to
displace similar products made at home,
If some other country produces an article
which we cannot produce in abundance and
we produce articles which the other nation
does not, an agreement which will give the
other nation a reduction of dutie on its
product in return for a similar advantage
to us for our goods is reciprocity. There
Is no other reeiprocitj-. The President' as
sertion that the protective tariff is the ac
cepted policy of the country is true. There
aro a few who think otherwise, but, con
sidered outside of politics, the mass of
American believe in the general principle
because it retains for American labor and
capital the great and growing American
market and upholds that scale of wages
which has made the living of the American
farmer and wa?e earner the most generous
and tha most btneilcent in the world.
The views of the President regarding in
terstate commerce and the necessity of
such action as will insure fair dealing to
all shippers will meet with the approval of
the country. That the President approves
of labor organization shows that ho is in
touch with the industrial movement of the
country. His hearty indorsement of the
movement for the gradual reclamation of
the arid lands by federal assistance is evi
dence of his progressive spirit. lie advo
cates a large navy because it is a guarantee t
of peace. He shows what the Monroe doc- j
v v Uiiw UHU lie! v 14. 1 w 1 ail 14- Ut"
clares the purpose of the United States ,to
adhere to it, not in a boastful manner, but
as a matter of self-protection and in the
interest of the world's ieacc. Those timid
ftoul3 who have expressed fears that the
President would say something offensive to
European governments will be tranquillized
..... .. . , . 4
'by the discovery that the keynote to all his
remarks relating to foreign nations is peace. !
The Philippines are ours, and it is better j
for the natives and the world that they j
continue under our Has to receive the civil
izing influences of the American Nation.
A few may deny tho existence of such a
necessity, but the mass of the American
people is in accord with the President.
He advocates reciprocity with Culm as a
duty rather than a matter of policy, and in
a manner so able that the opponents of
such a policy should be silenced.
These are a few ef the salient points In
one of the most statesmanlike messages an
American President has ever written. It
is conceived in that lofty and ardent spirit
of patriotism which recognizes a great
America and foresees the greater America,
the leader of all the nations.
The effect of tho decision of the Supreme
Court in tho Philippine islands case is that
these islands, like Porto Rico, ceased to be
a foreign country and became a part of the
United States for all purposes as soon as
the treaty ceding them was signed; that
they were, therefore, subject to the control
of Congress regarding taxation, but that,
pending legislation by Congress on the sub
ject, there must be free trade between the
islands and the United States both ways.
The same condition existed in Porto Itico
until the passage of the Foraker act, which
was upheld by the court. Until Congress
shall pass a law changing the present con
dition there must be free trade with the
Philippines and the duties collected on im
ports from the islands to the United Stales
since their acquisition must bo refunded.
Tho result will probably be that Congress
will, as soon as practicable, pass a law
something like the Foraker act, malting
specific regulations for trade with the Phil
ippines. THE HUMORISTS.

U. S. SIEGE BATTERIES
I3IPOItTAT OL'TfiltO WTU OF THE
iiucKvr wwn avitii ii.
Types of (iuns Used in the Organiza
ion Sehools of Instruction for
the Ollicer nnd .Men.
Lieut. A. P. S. Hyde, in Kansas City Star.
One of the outgrowths of the Spanish
war in the reorganization and enlargement
of our regular army is the organization ar:d
equipment of two siege batteries to serve
as schools of instruction for both officers
and men in this important branch of field
artillery.
The war in South Africa has shown the
world the inefficiency of light field guns
of three inches caliber or thereabouts
against a foe strongly intrenched and armed
with heavier guns. The Rritish early real
ized this fact, for to it are largely due their
many reverses during the early part of the
war. Thi3 defect in their artillery was only
remedied by the use of the naval six-inch
and tight-inch guns of the quick-firing
type mounted on improvised carriages.
The types of siege artillery which were
adopted by the ordnance department of our
army several years ago included the live
inch rifled siege gun, the seven-inch ritled
siege howitzer and the siege mortar of the
same caliber. Right here it might be wise
to explain for tho benefit of the layman
the uirTerenco between these three types
of cannon.
A gun, as it is called, is very long in com
parison to its caliber, or diameter, some
times being fifty times this latter dimen
sion. Thus a six-inch gun CX Inches, or
twenty-live feet, in length is known as a
six-Inch fifty-caliber gun. This, however, Is
an excessive length, the usual length being
forty calibers. A gun fires a large charge
of powder, giving the projectile a high
initial velocity, consequently giving a great
range and Hat trajectory. This gives rise
to what is called technically "direct fire,"
that is, with small elevation and the target
being attacked directly in front.
A howitzer is much shorter than a gun
in comparison to its caliber and fires a
small charge of powder. The result ia "in
direct," or curved, fire. The range is conse
quently shorter and the target is attacked
at an angle and usually at moderate ranges
with more destructive effect than with di
rect fire.
A mortar is even shorter in comparison
to its caliber than a howitzer and tires a
smaller charge, the result being "high
angle" fire, the object obtained being the
destruction of head cover and in general
destruction and demoralization behind the
enemy's parapet.
Quite a number of siege guns of these
types were built during the few years pre
ceding the Spanish war, but none were
placed In use until the summer of
when the army was preparing for the ad
vance on Havana. Then several of the sea
eoast batteries were reorganized as siege
batteries and given six each of the siese
guns or siege howitzers.
The organization, however, was very
faulty. There were no horses provided for
hauling the guns, ammunition wagons and
platform wagons belonging to the battery,
nor were there any trained drivers among
the enlisted men of the battery. In fact,
the battery was essentially a foot battey,
armed with siege guns, and the quarter
master's department was to furnish the
transportation with horsea and mules
driven by civilian teamsters a retrogres
sion of more than a hundred years in the
organization of field artillery. Fortunate
ly, the war ended before these so-called
siege batteries could take the field, and the
disastrous consequences which undoubtedly
would have ensued from their faulty or
ganization were thus avoided.
At the close of the war all these bat
teries were returned to their former status
except Battery K, of the Fifth Artillery,
and Rattery K. of the Sixth, which still re
tained, the former its siege guns and the
latter its siege howitzers, though little ad
vance was made in their organization and
equipment until early In 1S93.
When the Sixth Artillery was ordered to
the Philippine islands, there being no need
of siege guns there, Rattery F was ordered
to turn over its howitzers to the newly
organized Battery O, of the Seventh Artil
lery. PRACTICAL. ORGANIZATION.
The first advance made was the abolition
of the civilian teamsters of the quarter
master's department for the guns and the
training and employment of regularly en
listed members of the battery as drivers,
thus bringing the battery closer to its
proper status us u field battery. Still,
however, it was the Intention to have the
platforms and ammunition transported by
the quartermaster's department. This, too,
was a faulty arrangement, as it might
easily occur that the guns would reach the
point where they were to go into action
and the train transporting the platforms
and ammunition would be far in the rear.
It was a matter of several months be
fore this defect was remedied. Ordinary
army wagons were supplied at first, but
these proving very unsatisfactory, com
mercial wagons were purchased and
altered for use as ammunition and plat
form wagons until the ordnance depart
ment was able to design, build and thor
oughly test regular wagons for these pur
poses. Another important change was the reduc
tion of the material cf the battery from six
to four guns, with a corresponding decrease
in platform wagons. It was found that the
sir gun battery was too unwieldy for one
captain to handle and the present arrange
ment has so far been found to be much
more satisfactory.
The battery was then organized as fol
lows: There were two platoons, each com
manded by a lieutenant. Kaeh platoon con
sisted of two sections, each commanded by
a sergeant. Each section comprised a gun
and platform, and each drawn bv eicht
j horses, with the necessary noncommission
' ed officers, drivers and cannoneers. In ad
; clltlon to the above there was the usual
! battery wagon and forge drawn by six
! horses, the artillery store wanon drawn by
! four horses and the train. The train was
. commanded by a noncommissioned officer.
and comprised the four ammunition wag
ons and three army wagons for carrying
supplies and tentage, each being drawn by
six mules, driven by a jerk-lhie. '
This arrangement was not considered
satisfactory by the officers on duty with
the siege batteries, the principal objection
being that tho ammunition was with one
train instead of with the guns. Another
objection was that the mules which drew
the ammunition wagons were unable to
keep up with the horses of the battery on
the march and it is a well known fact that
mules are more easily stampeded under fire
than h6rses.
Due to the earnest recommendations of
Captain George V. Van Deusen to the
War Department, the mules have now been
ordered replaced by horses, and the am
munition wagons, drawn by eight-horse
teams, now form part of the battery proper,
one being assigned to each section.
Tile personnel of a siege battery includes
one captain, two first lieutenants, chiefs of
platoon?, one second lieutenant, chief of
caissons, one first sergeant, one quarter
master sergeant, one stable sergeant, six
sergeants, four of whom are chiefs of sec
tions, four artificers, including two black
smiths, one saddler and one- whcelwricht,
two trunqeters, two cooks and one hundred
and thirty-one privates, making a total of
four officers and one hundred and sixty
enlisted men.
Including the team horse mentioned
above and the necessary saddle horses for
officers and noncommissioned officers, to
gether with a sufficient number of spare
horses the battery requires in all one hun
dred and fifty-six animals.
Of the two siego batteries now in the
service the Eleventh Rattery, field artil
lery, formerly Skge Battery K. Fifth Ar
tillery. Is stationed at Fort Hamilton, New
York harbor. It Is commanded by Capt.
William H. Coffin. Theother officers are
First Lieutenant Harry P. Wilbur and Sec
ond Lieutenant William P. Knnis. There
is one vacancy as first lieutenant.
The other siege battery, the Sixteenth
Rattery, field artillery, formerly Siege
Lattery O. Seventh Artillery, is now sta
tioned at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, hav
ing recently changed station from Fort Rl
lev, Kansas. Its officers are Capt. George
W. Van Deusen and First Lieutenant Rus
sell P. Rheder and Arthur P. S. Hyde.
There is no second lieutenant at present
with the battery-
As stated above, th siege batteries are
intended largely as schools of Instruction
for officers nnd men, and the course, which
is entirely practical and very comprehen
sive, includes all the usc3 to which siege
artillery may be put, including mounted
batteries, drills, road marcnts, construc
tion of emplacements for the guns, use of
range .finders, target practice, - fording of
streams, horsemanship, etc., In addition to
the ordinary routine dutks, such as guard,
police, "stables" (groomir.g of the horses)
and horse exercise.
Practice marches are an important part
of the instruction. Every summer the
Eleventh Battery marches from its station
at Fort Hamilton to Monteauk Point, a dis
tance of 123 miles, for Its target practice.
The Sixteenth Ratterv, when stationed at
Washington Barracks". District of Colum
bia, in the autumn of 1 took an extended
practice march lasting thirty days. A
march from Fort Riley to Republic City to
participate in the Pike monument festivi
ties this year Avas interfered' with by the
battery receiving orders to change station
to Fort Leavenworth, and the weak condi
tion of certain bridges on the road inter
fered with a march overland iu changing
station.
A DAY WITH THE RATTERY.
It might be interesting to follow the daily
routine of duty of the Sixteenth Rattery.
Reveille sounds at G o'clock in the morn
ing, followed soon after by breakfast. At
o'clock morning stables occurs, lasting I
forty minutes. From 8 until S:30 ealisthenic
drill takes place, and at 9 o'clock the
principal drill of the day begins. This
varies with the seasons, and may bo mount
ed battery drill, road march, a tactical ex
ercise or merely horso exercise. Dinner is
at noon, afternoon stables at 4 o'clock, "re
treaV' at sunset, guard mounting immedi
ately after "retreat." supper at C, "tatoo"
at V, "call to quarters" at V)A'j and the
daiiy round of duty, except for the guard,
ceases with "taps" at 11 o'clock.
Stable duty ia one of tho most important
duties of mounted troops. At morning and
afternoon stables, each driver can fully
grooms his own pair of horses, spending
twenty minutes on each one, while the
cannoneers clean out th stables, make
down the horses beds and put their feed
in the mangers. The battery officer of the
day (one of the lieutenants) is present at
stables and superintends all the work. The
battery commander is also frequently pres
ent. Horse exercise is another important fea
ture of the battery routine. If tho roads
are impassable for the guns, as frequently
occurs in winter, or for any other reason, it
is impracticable for the battery to go out
hitched, the horses go out for exercise,
each driver riding Iiis near horse and lead
ing his off one. the battery ollicer of the
day being in command, for the horses must
have their regular exercise, summer and
winter, sunshine or snow.
During the winter months instruction iu
horsemanship is given in the riding hall at
the post for an hour every day. All men
who have been in the battery less than a
year constitute this riding class. The men
aro taught first, the proper seat, how to
hold on to the horse by the thighs and how
to control the horse quickly and surely un
der all circumstances. As this instruction
progresses it Is gradually varied by the ad
dition of mounted exercise, so that by the
end of the season a rough riding drill of
the squad is a far better exhibition than
the average circus.
The siege howitzers used by the Sixteenth
battery as well as the other guns used in
the army are built at the Watervliet arse
nal, near Troy, N. Y., by the Ordnance De
partment. They are built of steel, are
rifled and are breech-loaders. In fact, they
are truly modern guns. The howitzer, with
its carriage and limber, weighs pounds
borne on a wheel base of five by eight feet.
When it is remembered that this weight
added to that of nine horses, averaging
1,350 pounds each, aggregates 20,930 pounds,
all on a base of eighteen by two yards,
even a novice will understand that it takes
a strong bridge to carry the battery. And
this is the weight of only one gun and
team.
The projectiles fired are shell and shrap
nel weighing 105 pounds each, fired with a
charge of three and one-half pounds of
smokeless powder.
Each gun is accompanied by a platform,
as the officers of the Ordnance Department
were of opinion that the guns could not
be fired from the ground on account of
their great weight. This, however, has
proved not to be the case, for at target
practice this year. 'JOG rounds of ammuni
tion were tired either with no platform at
all, or with an Improvised tue consisting
of two plank?, one back of each wheel, its
front end resting on the ground and the
rear end on a pile of sand bags about
eighteen inches high. 1
This proved to be entirely satisfactory
and all that was necessary, even in soft
ground, and It will probably result in t he
discarding of the cumbersome platforms
heretofore in use.
A board of officers, consisting of Colonel
George B. Rodney, Captain William H.
Coffin and Captain George W. Van Deu
sen, is now in session at Fort Riley, hav
ing been convened to recommend the prop
er equipment for skgo batteries. In d
probability their most urgent recommenda
tions will be directed toward the acoui..ti
of the platforms and a reduction in the
weight of the gun carriage.
THE WAR TEST TO .COME.
As yet our siege batteries have not had
the supreme test of war to determine the
merits of their organization, though, from
the work accomplished thus far. under cir
cumstances as closely approaching war as
it is possible to obtain in time of peace, I
they have been so successful as to justify
the expectation that they will come fully
up to what is expected of them in timo of j
war. J
The Sixteenth Battery, then known as i
siege Battery "O," Seventh Artillery, went
as far as San Francisco last summer a ,
year ago. en route to China, as it was
thought the siege gun would be required 1
in reducing the walls of Peking. The city !
had been entered by the allied troops be
fore the battery could embark, and so it
was sent back to Fort Rilej.
Of the fjfrlcers of the Sixteenth Battery.
Captain George W. Van Deusen is known
throughout the army as one of the best
and most thoroughly progressive and up-to-date
artillery officers. In Lsw he was
sent to England by the government for
the purpose of Inspecting and shipping
some Maxim-Nordenfeldt mountain guns,
which had been purchased for use in the
Philippines. From England he went to
Manila, where he successfully organized
two mountain batteries, one of which, un
der command of Captain Stivers, Thirty
first Infantry, U. S. V., a graduate of West
Point, did excellent service during several
campaigns in the southern islands. The
other battery.- under his own command,
accompanied General Schwan's expedition
i in Southern Luzon, whe:re it was not only
successiui in everything it undertook, due
to Captain Van Deusen's skill n an ar
tillery officer, but returned to Manila at
the close of the campaign without the loss
of a man or an animal.
An interesting accompaniment of siege
artillery is the searchlight train. It Is in
tended that one such train shall accompany
each battalion of four siege batteries in
time of war. It consists of one searchlight
carriage, resembling somewhat a light ar
tillery caisson. the searchlight being
mounted on what corresponds to the mid
dle and rear ammunition chests, one car
riage, carrying on its limber an electric
dynamo, and on its main portion a steam
engine; one boiler with jointed smoke stack,
also with a limber; one barrel cart for
carrying water for the boiler, very similar
to a watering cart; and several army
wagons for carrying fuel. It is intended
that a six-horse team shall haul each car
riage and that the men to man the search
light and its appurtenances be made by de
tails from tho batteries. An officer is to
command the train.
The first actual test of the use of search
lights in land warfare was made in South
Africa, where the British successfully used
them for long distance signaling at night.
It is also intended to use them for observ
ing the enemy's movements at night.
There are now four of these trains in the
army, one being Kcated at Port Leaven
Worth and another at Fort Riley.
Whatever will be the outcome of siege j
artillery In our service, whether from time i
to time other changes will be made in its
organization, or whether the number of
siege batteries will be increased, it is im
possible to say, but it Is a satisfaction to
know that the government has undertaken
the organization and training of this im
portant branch of the field artillery with !
such eminent success that in time of war '
we may expect the most efficient service
possible.

THE REMEDY P0R ANARCHY.
Mint It Off nt the I'oiintnin Head, the '
Incendiary Frcs.
t
London Lancet. j
The sole consolation which the viperous ;
brood or Anarchists have upon an occasion
such as the present is that their crime sets
tho various governments of the civilized
world iu a ferment as to how to check the
j,ct. The crimes cf anarchy aro so futile,
so stupid, and withal so easy to carry out,
that their terror consists in the impossibil
ity of foreseeing when they will happen.
Any complacency that the anarchistic lead
ers may feel In the trouble that they have
created will, we hope, be removed by dras-
iio concerted measures against tht-ni. The j
United States will lead the way with p'-
culiar satisfaction, and the European ra
lions mav be tm-ted to assist.
America and England have long beeen
known as the two countries where a man !
undergoes no disabilities or his pom..il j
s.. , i .... ti,,t ith.r
eountry is likely to change in this respect.
Rut anarchy is not a political opinion its
preachers, teachers and active members
arc simply and solely pests of society, and
should be remorselessly harried, even as a
pack of rabid wolves would be. The whole
of Europe and ef the various countries of
the two Americas will be searching for a
remedy for the state of things that makes
anarchy possible.
We do not deny that In some cases an
archy is bred of poverty and oppression, or
that a portion of the remedy for crime is
to be found in improving the social condi
tions of workers of every class. But In the
meantime tho assassins, whether the-y are
the actual perpetrators or the instigators
of murder, must be taught that punish
ment swift and terrible awaits them. It is
Impossible to legislate for the removal of
motive in an apparently motiveless crime,
and where an assassin is willing to lay
down his life to accomplish a crime It Is
well-nigh Impossible to prevent him carry-
anity
in the glorification of a public execution
and the world-wide reports of his trial, and
these gratifications should be taken away
from him.
But the head and front of the evil Is the
propagandist, the man of culture and edu
cation, who scatters his glib vaporings
about property and the rights of man
broadcast by means of the press. Authors
and publishers of incendiary and seditious
prints should be punished as severely and
in as uninteresting a manner as possible;
for, though it be the educated brain which
conceives inflammatory articles, and the?
hand which has never done an honest day's
work which writes them. yer. the miser
able beings who translate these theories
into acts are the poor, who are bred in
misery and nurtured in hopelessness, j
Their own misery, and what they can do
or can not do, assume a disproportionate j
Importance in their eyes, and in the vapor- j
ings ot Anarchist writers they see revela
tions of a I'topia.
The remedy is to shut off the stream of
violent ideas at the fountain head.
SEVEN-MASTED SCHOONER.
Wonderful Yeel That In Being Built
in n I)otou Yxtrtl.
New York Herald.
The biggest schooner in the world is now
building and is remarkable chiefly because
she will have seven masts, three more than
the largest ships and one more than has
ever appeared from the deck of a fore-and-after.
The first seven-master has been designel
by Ii. B. Crowninshield and is being built
in the Fore river shipyard in Boston har
bor alongside of the cruiser Des Moines,
and is more than one hundred feet longer
than that vessel.
The principal dimensions of the, new
schooner are as follows: Length over all,

8.U00 tons of coal, nearly half as much again
as tho "big sixes," Is unlike them, being
uiiiu i.ii lü tii v i v. v i iui cirti r.i j
masts and a steel bowsprit. The seven
masts will be 135 feet from step to cap and
the wooden topmasts will be sixty feet long.
The new schooner will have all the mod
ern equipment, steam winches and sail
hoists, steam steering gear and a double
steel bottom capable of holding about 1,2" w
tons of water ballast. The rudder post is
as tall as an ordinary tree, the hoops on
the masts will be us large as cart wheels,
while a fall from the end of the bowsprit
would be like dropping from a fifth-story
i window
In the Fore river yard a granite founda
tion more than a block long has been built
for the steel keel, and in the shops the steel
frames and plates are being trimmed and
drilled and shaped ready to be riveted into
place.
This vessel will cost about $2ä0.rM). and
her capacity to pay for herself will depend
largely upon the fact that she will require
a crew of only sixteen men, less than half
the number necessary for working an ordi
nary square-rigged ship. Capt. J. G. Crow
ley, for whom sue is being built, hns set
tled the ouestion of the nomenclature of
the masts by calling them, respectively, ,
fore, main, mizzen, spanker, jigger, driver
and pusher. '
She has not been chartered, but hrr first
vovage will probably be to the Philippines
with a cargo of coal. The own rs say that
she will sail wherever they find she can
make the most mmey. It is said that the
five- and six-masted schooners make enough
in three or four years to pay for them
selves. Owners of the seven-master will
not give any idea of what they expect in
dividends.

"Is it true that Prir.ce Turn has been j

"Prince Tuan has been punished," said ;
the viceroy.
"Why was ho not executed?"
"It is against the laws of China to exe

"Rut," said the e-orrespondent, "the pres

prince in the htt r bellioii."
"He was fighting against tho govern

"Then, as Prince Tuan was fighting for
the government, the dowager Empress
must have combined with him in tho at

with a vengeance, having already boucht
two newspapers at the capital, and a third
at the metropolis, besides being in the mar
ket for other jourö ils in oilier elti s.
Personally, Mr. Munsey is both an inter
esting and a remarkable man. Tall, slet.d r,
as sanguine iu color n lie is in disposition,
he is the: very embodiment of the ihoroiicli
ly modern "down Euter." He is of rural
birth; his earlier business training was
Mchitved In the country town of Augusta,

his phenomenal success has all boon metro
