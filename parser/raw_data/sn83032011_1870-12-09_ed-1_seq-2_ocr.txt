Tho Message
Wo glvo tho President's Message nt
length, but leavo tho reatlor to form his
own conclusions. That It Is a very
common placo document Is sutllclently
palpable, and it Is equally clear that no
ono will bo tho wiser for reading It.
Tho vapid, nervous attempts of tho
Philadelphia Press to Impress Its read
ors with tho idea that tho message
broadly favors a Tariff for protection
tho protection of tho days of IIlINHY
Clay aro amusing nnd ridiculous.
Were nny Democrat to use tho Presl
dent's precise language, ho would be
roundly denounced as it freo trader.
It will be seen by tho very last sen
tencoln tho message that tho President
broadly and sternly nnnounces himself
In favor of suffrage so universal that
"every man " may vote without ro
gard to " nativity or color." Of course
this Includes very creature that may
be called a man Negro, Chlnnman, or
any thing else. As tho right to vote
carries with It every other right, per
feet equality lu ull things Is palpably
aimed at. ft Is well that wo at length
have a clear understanding of tlio Bad
leal platform.

The coustructlau of so mo of these
thoroughfares has undouutedly given a
vigorous impulse to the development of
our resources and tho settlement of the
moro distant portions of the country.
It may, however, bo well Insisted that
much of our legislation in this regard
has been characterized by indiscrimi
nate and profuse liberality. Tho United
States should uot loan their credit in
aid of uny onterpriso undertaken by
States or corporations, nor grant lands
in any instance, unless tho projected
work is of acknowledged national
importance.
I am strongly inclined to tho opinion
that it is Inexpedient and unnecessary
to bestow subsidies of either descrip
tion, but should Congress determine
otherwise I earnestly recommend that
the rights of settlers and of the public
bo moro effectually secured and protect
ed by appiopriatc legislation.

Supporting Bolters.
Tho newt-papers are still discussing
the propriety of tho Democratic mom
b of the Ijeglsluturo supporting a
bmtin'.' itepubllcan for Stato Treasurer,
Tuusir seems perfectly clear that the
duty of thu minority in tho case IS not
to support a candidate merely because
he is n bolter from his party for theso
are usually, if not lnvarIably,tho worst
and meanest amongst all tho candidates
but If one Republican candidate hap
en to bean honest and competent man,
and tho other not, then who will ques
tion that the first ought to bo supported
and the other opposed? Wo do not ex
pect to seo the Democratic members so
happily situated as to have such cholco
to make, but we do insist that they can
not bojustlfled in supporting a Repub
lican roguo or Incompetont under nny
circumstances they havo no right to
compromlso their party in that way.
Tho fact that a candldato Is a bolter
from liis party can only recommend
him in case ho bolts upon principle
and tho opposite party may only prop
erly support hlmln the case that they
sympathize witli or npprovo that prin
ciple. That tho worst clement of the
Itepubllcan party is represented by
Senator Cameuon', and "that it should
bo defeated wherever possible, und by
anybody, is doubtless true, if it can be
done without too deeply soiling clear
consciences. But to put tho proposition
In other words to eject u rascal by
Democratic votes in order to defeat au
equally delectable rascal who is the Ite
publlcan nominee Is a position that
can not bo honorably assumed and for
which thero is no manly justification.
It is chillis' play, a thing to amuse sim
pletons, and reiides the party respon
sible for the acts of tho candidate they
elect.
It is not good party tactics. This fact
was sufficiently illustrated by tho old
Whig party. It invariably supported
Democratic bolters and constantly thus
e'evated Democratic vagabond to high
official position. Tho Democracy were
annoyed by it, but never seriously In-
Juted. But mark tho result to the
Whigs! Their organization was so
thoroughly demoralized, their mem
bers became to accustomed to support
ing any and every body and every thing
that was opposed by the Democracy,
without regard to principle, that their
whole party was quickly swallowed up,
nnd forever destroyed, by tho first mush
roon organization that solzcd upon its
selfish leaders and consorts and prom
ised triumph over tho Democracy. It
was a natural and just result. Aro wo
low to follow the example and reap tho
nnmo reward? We say emphatically
no ! Already candidates who aro not
D'icot'rats aro proposed lo us and ve
loMiinnt!y advocated from President
d'nm, and If supporting such by our
orginizi'lon Is continued, in a very
brief period thero will bo no real dif
ferent" ln'tweoii parties, and both will
become mere gtmblers for spoils, the
most thorough trl iksters winning! Lot
every man ponder tho question wheth
er It Is not moro Important to sustain
honest action than to win tomporary
and illusory triumph.
Tho Law of Llbol.
Tho editor of tho Mauch Chunk Time
has boon prosccutod for libel by Thom
as FosTKit, for nssortttig or Insinuating
that ho had altered certain election re
turns, and denounces that individual
for seeking "rofugo behind tho libel
law of an obtolelo ago a law which
assumes that "tlio greator tho truth the
greater tho llbol," and forbids the fads
to bo given In evidence."
Wo do do not agrco In this ilemincla
Hon of tlio old law by our friend. Tho
old inxxlin quoted Is only true when
applied to affairs in which tho public
havo no concern, and in thnt connection
Is palpably just. In tho caso In ques
tlon, tho matter (If true) was proper
for public Information, nnd tho trutli
of tlio allegation may therefore be pro
von upon trial, and If established will
work acquittal. Tho Constitution of
Pennsylvania expressly declares that
"whero tho matter published is proper
for public Information, tlio truth there
of may bo given in evidence," and no
law of tho Legislature or dictum of a
Court can set nsido or weakon this plain
and wholesome provision. If Col. Fu
hey has stated fa its that ho can prove,
ho Is safe If ho has been misinformed,
It Is equally plain that it his duty to
say so. Wo know his manly instincts
wilt lead him to vindicate tho right.
Wo may bo obtuse but whether or
not, wo never could see tho Justice of
tho denunciation of the good oltl law.
It is about tho only barrier, In addition
to good breeding and public sentiment,
that restrains blackguards from outra
glng privato persons and public deceu
ey, and plunging wholo communities
into libel nod war. It in no wiso re
strains editors from publishing nny
truthful matter that Is proper for public
information, and this Is all that ought
over bo published. No ono will sub
scrlbo to this moro heartily than tho
able editor of tho Mauch Chunk Times.
Tho Army.

there Is a second reason why every, ilf.

tlenerul Shk.iman does not find It ne
cessary to refer to this excess of officers,
but tho u.-e of tho nrmy ns pollco elicits
from him as strong a protest as official
decorum permits, lleferrlng to this use,
"which has become so common of late,"
ho gives It as his opinion that tho mill
tnrj should only bo employed as n posse
comitutus, duly summoned by tho uni
ted Stntcs Marshal, nnd acting In his
personal presence. This Is not only a
reaffirmation of tho old and correct doc
trine, but n sovero rebuko to tho Presl
dent for his persistent degradation of
tho army into an instrument of popular
surveillance and menace. It will not
read well nbroad that tho General of
tho United States army protests against
tho prostitution of his soldiers into

Is tho extremity to which General

Tricks of Treasury Suckers.
For years passed, in this Stato, a com
blnation consisting of corrupt elements
in both parties, has not only existod for
the purpose but lias actually successful
ly controlled the elections for Stato
Treasurer. In nlno cases out of ton
they manage to nominnto tho candid
ntesof both parties, and thus keep the
contest circulating amongst themselves!
Let which party may triumph, tbo
rascals win gaiu the Treasury and
divide, tho heavy spoil. Wo seo tho
element again nt work, and with tho
usual prospect of success. A Radical
corruptionist is to bo nominated by tho
Iladlcal caucus parties in thu ring will
endeavor to control tho Democratic
nomination, nnd if successful will nomi
nate ono of themselves or a tool and
an outsldo radical roguo will be presen
ted as a bolting candidate. Tho Demo
cratic members will, thorefore, as things
havo been managed In times past, bo
compelled to choose between theso
grand thieves I No difference which Is
elected, tho result Is thu same und tiio
tax-payers uro the sufferers.
Now, under those clrcuinstancos, it is
tt plain duty of tho representatives of
the Democracy in the Legislature to
vindicate their party, to keep it clear
from aspersion or suspicion, und to seo
that its candidates aro men of tho high
est churactcr for integrity and have no
personal combinations or connections with
Simon Cameron. This latter point is
highly essential, for that adroit mana
ger has agents within tho lines of
tho Democratic party us woll us out
of it, und ho manages soft headed
Democrats ubout us readily as he does
ills own party. Some of theso are al
ready seeking tho Democratic nomina
tion, und may have u majority of the
members committed before thoy arrivo
at Iiariisburg to consult with each oth
er. We hope our iriomls will havo tho
good sense aud high respect for them
selves and their parly, to throw ovor

Political Dogcncracy.
It certainly does not augur well for
our political institutions that thoro Is a
largo degeneracy in tho character of
those who represent them. A fow years

Their successors nro now Sumner and
Wilson. From New Hampshire, wo
ued to havo Woodbury nnd Plerco.
Wo now havo nobody of nny promi

Wright and N. P. Talmadgo. We now

in Pennsylvania takes tho place of
James Buchanan, John Scott of Georgo
M. Dallas, nnd John Sherman of Tlins.
Ewing In Ohio. Carl Schurz occupies
tho placo of Thomas II. Benton In Mis.
sotirl, nnd Dick Yates takes tho seat of
Stephen A. Douglass. In Tennesspo
tho black guard editor, Brownlnw,
usurps tho position of Hugh L. Whlto
nnd Folix Grundy. Tho South, now
represented by unknown enrnet bangers
from the North, had then such mon in
Congress ns John C. Calhoun, Robert Y
Hayne, Georgo McDufile, John M. Br
rion, Geo. G. Badger, W. C. Preston,
Geo. U. Poindexter, Win. It. King. W.
C. Rives, Governor Tazswell and Gen
Sam. Houston.
Thu most unmlstakeablo ovldonco of
the reigning imbecility in tho Rullcal
party is tho lack of men who are com
petent to represent what nt least ought
to bo tho dignity of tho United States,
nt tho Court of nny first class power, ns
illustrated by tho difficulty Gen. Grant
has had in obtaining a suitable Minister
to send to tho Court of Great Britain.
At one time In tho history of tho Re
publican party It had men of calibro
and capacity. Then Salmon P. Chao,
W. M. Evarts, James R. Doollttlo, Ed
gar Cowan and tcores of other states
men acted with tho party, cither of
whom would honor their country abroad
and add lustre to its statesmanship.
But tho raco of learned, accomplished
and fearless men has died out of tho
Radical party, and their places aro fill
ed with upstarts and snobs, booted and
spurred, ready to rido the country and
all its past glory to the devil.
The course of politics seems to havo
been from tho highest realm of intelli
gence down.to tho lowest pools of Igno
rance and corruption. Erie Observer.
"Land for tho Landless."
That was ono of tho promises of tho
Radical party when it first got control
of Congress In 18G0. To a certain ex
tent it has made good that promise. It
has given "land to tbo landless," but not
tho "landless" It pretended to favor
tho honest, toiling, poor men of tho
country. The "landless" it provided
with lands was tho thieving contractors
of "New England" tho carpet-bag
scalawags of tho South and tho Rvlical
rascals who loaf round tho lobbies of
Congress, getting up railroad compa
nlos, and asking the government to
build the roads, and allow them to havo
tho profits.
Hero is tho amount of land they havo
given to these "landless" corporations
tho number of broad acres they have
taken from tho people tho working,
tax-cursed masses and given to cor
rupt corporations. To railroad compa
nies it has given as follows :

Tlio Now Ca3tlo Gazette and BernO'

A Bai PrtACTicE. Tho Buffalo Ex
press rightly says: Keeping children
after school is, in overy respect, a bad
practice. It aunoys both toacher and
pupil, and Is an evil which perpetuates
itself. Pupils who aro kept after school
usually go hotno out of humor with
teacher and school generally. It should
bo a constant aim to arrange things in
such a way that overy pupil may go
homo feeling happy. Tho result aimed
at by this practice may, in most cases,
bo reached in other ways. Tho natural
consequenco of poor lessons would seem
to bo falling in rank. In graded schools
pupils who miss their lessons muy bo
placed in lower classes, even in a lower
department.
The Now York Evening Post, a Rad
ical organ in good standing, edited by
tho veteran Wm. CuiiLEN Bhyant,
says: "Tho peopio aro disgusted with
General Quant's subserviency to notor
ious hack politicians, monopolists and
political traders of all kinds j they sen
with Jealousy his open interference
with elections at tho dictation of theo
persons, nnd with disgust his support
of men notoriously unfit for public

Congress re-assembled on Monday
last. One of the first acts lu the House
was to consider a bill to grunt ono mill
ion of acres of laud to tho St. Croix and
Bayfield Railroad. During tho discus
sion Mr. Woon said thut tills Congress
had already given a total of 28,000,000
acres to railroad companies, btoldes 42,
000,000 to tho Pacific Railroad, making
a total of 70,000,000 of acres I Final ac
tion was not taken on tho bill, but it
will no doubt pass. Will tho peopio
over awaken to tho squandering propen
ultiM of tho Radicals V
whli'h show-! tint tho Massachusetts
So. ator is onj i.vi ig i lucid interval,
Revenue reformers claim that in
looKiiig over their numbers, they find
themselves so strong, that, with the aid
of tho Democrats, they think thoy can
elect thu House Speaker, ami so control
the Clialrmanshlp of thoimportaiit Com
mittee of Ways and Means in tho Forty
second Congress. If such a union bo
effected, it will leave General Gka.nt
powerless in tho lower Houso. Age.
The Radical Governor and Treasurer
of Alabama persist in holding on to
tho offices, notwithstanding their do
feat and tho election of Democrats in
their stead. Tho matter bus bcou re
ferred to tho courts. A meeting at
Montgomery made up almost entirely
of Republicans, denounced tho courso
oi tho Governor and Treasurer, and pro
nounced tho election a fair one,
Inst few veurR. bv ontiresslve laws 'tnil
crushing taxation, were frenf to seek
their fortunes and their happiness in
their own way. Hence, under clrcnni
stances so favorable to Individual en
terprise, every body sought to make
money and to been u it rich, nnd Hie go
Mills of the Vnierlcaii peopio soon d -
velopo.1 itself Into the unremitting and
untiring pursuit of "tho almighty dol
lar l" Tho enthusiastic believers In tho
lhcessant oxcrclso, by tho people, of
their sovereign power, when they Un
dertook to populnrl.o tho Stnto Consti
tution, adopted by our revolutionary
fathers, seem to havo entirely lost sight
of this peculiar feature In tho American
character. They absurdly belluved that
business men who bolted their meals at
tho risk of strangulation nnd dyspepsia
In order to ndd n few minutes to their
business hours, and who could not find
tlmo to give their children tt home edit
cation, would willingly dovoto a largo
share of their tlmo to tho affairs of tho
nation I That they, who could not find
tho tlmo to dovoto to their homo duties,
would liberally dovoto it to a patient
enquiry Into tho qualifications, charac
ter and moral standing of numberless
candidates for olllco ! This oversight,
on tho part of our political philoso
phers, proved fatal to their cherished
theory. Llko Archimedes, they failed,
for want of a fulcrum to their lover.
That Is, tho great nuns of tho people
failed them : and the Power, which, utr
tier their nmended constitution, thoy
intended should bo wielded by that
mass, Insensibly slipped, as I observed
in my lust, into tho hands of an organ
ized band of trading politicians nnd
demagogues, who, in accordance with
tho spirit of tho times, made politics a
money making business nnd a specula
tion I Hence, In conjunction with oth
er causes I havo heretofore enumera
ted, our legislatures Boon abounded in
white men, ready and willing, tiny anx
ious, to sell themselves for sums of
motiey, ranging infinitely below tlio
prices which likely young Negroes com
manded, at the auction block, lu tho
days of slavery : with this difference
however, that tho poor Negroes had no
cholco allotted them In tho matter,
whilo our modern white slaves havo no
rest until thoy havo found a bidder and
a master! Hence, our courts became
political marts, wlieio Coko and IJIack
stone have much less to say, In tho ad
judication of justice, than ptitizau
newspapers; whoru tlio zeal of pettifog
ging district attorneys, in tho prosecu
tlon of crime, rises or lulls in duo pro
portion to their personal intere-ts or
political relations; and whero cibtis
exist, which, in point of Iniquity, ex
ceed by ur, Hi- most infamous rings
that ever disgraced u Legislature or ox
cited thu inillt'iiation of tlio people.
Hence, a Slate Governor stripped of
power iiin-l therefore impotent lo up
hold tho dignity or tho sovereignty of
the Commonwealth ; a meru shadow
of eyecutivo power either, nccording to
his bent, tho ready lackey of tho Presi
dent of tho United States, or the help
less and grumbling protestant against
Federal usurpation I Henco from all
this fearful exhibition of olllcial demor
alization, tho purchase und sale of nom
inations to olllco; tho corruption of po
litical conventions; tho bribery of olec
tors and tho rapid falling off of public
virtue.
Who will now daro to deny theso up
paling charges ? If thoy aro not appli
cablo to all tho localities of this Com
monwealth j tho honorable exceptions
which may now exist, will soon disap
pear beforo tho blasting examples which
utiblushingly appeal to the cupidity
and tho worst passions of men. Is it
not then tlmo that tho great mas of tho
peopio who havo heretofore been quios
cent spectators of tho approaching diS'
solution of their freo government,
should rouso themselves to tho con
sciousness of tho many dangers which
surround thcin V dangers iuvol vlng tho
Irretrievable loss of their civil nnd reli
gious liberties, and even of tho protec
tion of life and property which the cor
ruption of their judicial tribunals will
soon ceaso to ail'ord them ! This is now
tho great question of tho day, which
comes homo to tho bosom and business
of every man, who, upon tho least ro
flection, must seo his dearest personal
ititerests concerned in tho immediate
and thorough reform of tho organic
laws of tho Commonwealth.
Tho first step to be taken in this di
rection is tho election of a Stato Reform
Convention, upon principles of fairness
without any view to immediate parti
zan advantages. This Is tho imperative
and solo condition upon which tho Con
stitution can bo so amended ns to pro
servo for tho peopio tho priceless boon
of a freo representative government.
To that effect, an honest apportionment
of the Stato should bo made, and tho
party minorities in each electoral district
should be represented, so that the whole
I peopio may bo represented In the Re
! lorm Convention
I am awarn that certain politicians
will wonder ut my simplicity in asking
a party iinjorlty lo forego tho opportit
nity of di-iraiiclil-iiig as many ot thejr
political opponents us po-silile, while
apportioning llio members of so impor
tant it body as a convention to remodel
the government of the Cummonwcaitli
But I will tell thoso politicians, that
the Convention is to bo called for tho
correction of great political wroims.
under which tlio Republic can no lon
ger exist; that among thoso wrongs,
gerrymandering is one of tho most oil!
ous und most fatal to representative
government; and that no Reform Con
ventlon can meet tho expectations of
tho people, whoso members owo their
election to fraud and injustice.
Let it then bo over understood, by tho
mon of whatever party who favor this
reform movement, that it can bo suc
cessful only by the fair representation of
both tho great political parties, und of
nil tho people in a Convention intended
to reinstate right whero wrong now ex.
