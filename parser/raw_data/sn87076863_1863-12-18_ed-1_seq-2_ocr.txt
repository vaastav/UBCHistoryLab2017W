presentation pf a plan by the National
Executive, consists in the danger of com

safely left to further developments, care
has been taken to so shape the document
as to avoid embarrassment from this
source. In saying that ou cer nin terms,
certain classes will be pardoned, with
their rights restored, it is not said that,
other classes on other terms will never be

In the midst of other earee however

fact that the war power is still our main

look yet for a time to give ooulidence to
the people in contested regions that the
insurgent power will not again .overrun
them. Until that confidence shall be es-,
tablished little can be done .nny-where
for what ia called reconstruction. Hence,
our ch infest care musttslill be directed to
the Army and Navy, who have thus far
bo-ne their harder part so nobly and weh

giving the greatest efficiency to their in
dispeusibU arms we do also honorably

Friday Morning, Dec. 18, 18C3
The President's Message.
We publish in this issue of onf mper the nn:
nnat Hessaje of the Presidtnt rof tha U. 8.
which is usually looked fer villi nnxiity, and
rend with interest by all who wish to keep post
ed concerning (ho inul.iplicd srul iutnntly
aiigiaenting rilulions of our extended domain,
even in times of profound pence. IJut at this
time, when the ceuntry has been ft. reed ihto s
war involving the lifu of the'natiou, the Mis-
sufie is soutrht for. with civat ens;ernc&3, and
licrused, with unusual intiT'st. -
This Message is an admirable, bnsincss-like
document, and perlY-ctly cliaraot' ristio of i!s
author. It is a straight-forward, manly pro
duction, abounding iu truthful narrative and
.common-sense logic. Ko one can doubt its pa
ternity. It bus the fcaturus. and literary ear
marks of oObi Abe," and is Lincoln all over.
It is the conception of a clear load and an hon
est heart, and is fearlessly promulgated as a dis
closure of the acts, views and intentions of an
Executive who is more.of a patriot Uian a pot-itieiunTT-wlioae
love of truth, mercy nud justice
is tin oyiioauro of his ambition. , He has not
buried his. opinions in mystic tropes and figures,
but has uttered them in plain English, ossify
comprehended by the masses of the American
public, whoso President ho is, and whose wel
faro ho is faithfully endeavoring to promote.
The Jbssage disclosrs the fact, thst.-liotwith-Btunding
the magnitude of the rebellion, our
country is msintainiug- a character, abroad,
whieh the enemies of popular government can
not tarnish, Wo are at peaca with all fureign
powens, and our ability to defend ourselves, 8-
guiust the assaults of external foes, has heen
clearly demonstrated by the success of our un
aided efforts to crush the rebtllion. Although
our national .debt is large, and rapidly increas
ing, we have the satisfuctinn of knowing that
it is a home debt, which is becoming so fini'l.cn1
as to preclude the probability of serious pnssul
or future embarrassment. Our currency, for do
mestic purposes, has, perhaps never been excell
ed, in time of war ; and the production of the
preoiom metals, afforded by cur inexhaustible
mines, gives presage of sn eurly return to a spe
cie basis, after the establishment of pence.
Our expenditures during this war, it appears,
will not prove that their sum is so much capital
sunk, for we shall have a Navy that will he a
ble to cope with that of any single government
on the globe, if not with the combined powers
of tho world, itWe adhere to our defensive pol
icy. Ourland fortifications and armorits, will
beof immense value, and may bo worth, as h
menace, oven while idle, five times the amount
of their cost, snytny nothing of the value of the
military discipline of our citizen soldiery'.
The Pn-sirleiit's plan of teconstruetion seems
to meeet the ;eord!a1 approbation of nearly all
true Union men, and is likely to prove sb effect
ive as it is wise and merciful. There is little
doubt but the amnesty it proff.ra will be em
braced by tho nonslnvcbolding massts of the
Sinllh, as euon as it is fully understood. They
already biginningto umbratand that they
have net been fighting for themselvrs, but for
their "lug men ;" and itisbelived this fact will
be generally promulgated and speedily compre
hended 'by the misguided southern people, lu
deed, in the languag'1 of the Tero'ito Globe, aa
aide Canadian paper, in commenting upon the
Message: "The great Southern II 'b ellion is on
its hist legs. It may hist six months, or a year,
but it is not to be disputed, by any fair minded
observer, that it is dyin-g. The fall of Rich
mond and the tlight of Jeff. Davis and his Cab
inet cannot be far off."
Tho documents, which accompany tho Mes
sage, are full of interest, but are toei b ngtjiy for
eiur columns. The re-port of the IVst Master
G ne'rnl shows that his Department, iimUad of
proehiciug a drain upon the Treasury of near
half a million of dollars per annum, has, since
the loping off of the exvnsivo miil service in
the seceded states, Income almeist sdf euetain
ing. The report of the Secretary of the h tor -
or gives an interesting acount of the Territories,
and eif the extinguishment of Indian, titles,
therein, as well as of the extent and richness of
our mineral lands.
The Secretary of the Navy shows thst tho
heavy ordnance of the fi avy, alone, has been
iucrtased sinoe 18G1, frem 2166 to 5,777 pieces.
and that twe-r 700 more guns of the new sort will
be done before the year clewos. Our naval ves
sels have been increased from' "6 to SH8, includ
ing many substantial iron-claels, constructed
and in process of cetnstructiou.
From the report of our excellent Secretary of
the Treasury we glean the fact that, up to tho
2!)lh ult., one hundred and thirty four ssseicia
tious hail organized unebr tho National Act,
and aelopted the name of "National Bank.o
These institutions have sprung up in seventeen
States and iti moat of the principle cities in the
Union, New Orleans not excepted. Seeretsry

ot many ot the securities dealt in. It is

the pressure in the moDcy maikel, at an
avciagu of more than two millions per ehiy.

We regtet to learn that the rebels have
laid an embargo upon the transmission
of comforts and necessaries to their ptis
oneis. What motive, whether envy,
or devilish malice, prompts them to with
hold the sustenance generously proU'ered
by friends of our brave officers and sol-
diers.which the forluuesof war have incar
cerated in loathsome slave piisons, we
know not. We think w are not wrong
in enlartaiiiing the belief that, such bar
