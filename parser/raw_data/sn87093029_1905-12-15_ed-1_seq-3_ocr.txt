MESSAGE SUMMARY
PRES. ROOSEVELT'S ADDRESS TO
CONGRESS TOOK THREE HOURS.
Rate Regulation Demands First Atten
tion—Present Laws Ineffective—
More Money for Canal Work—Asks
for Larger Navy—Revise Immigra
tion Laws—Change Land Laws.
Washington, D. C.—At 11:40 Tues
day morning assistant secretary to the
president, Barnes, and executive Clerk
Young and a messenger left the White
House bearing copies of the presi
dent's message for reading in the
house and senate and for distribution
among the member.
The reading of the message began
at 12:23, eight minutes later than in
the senate. It required three hours to
read.
President's Message.
To the Senate and House of Rep
resentatives —The people of this coun
try continue to enjoy great prosperity.
Undoubtedly there will be ebb and
flow in such prosperity, and this ebb
and flow will be felt more or less by
all members of the community, both
by the deserving and undeserving.
Against the wram of the Lord the wis
dom of man can not avail; in times
of flood or drought human ingenuity
can but partially repair the disaster.
A general failure of crops would hurt
all of us. Again, if the folly of man
mars the general well-being, then
those who are innocent of the folly
will have to pay part of the penalty
incurred by those who are guilty of
the folly. A panic brought on by the
speculative folly of part of the busi
ness community would hurt the whole
business community. £ut such stop
page of welfare, though it might be
severe, would not be lasting. In the
long run the one vital factor in the
permanent prosperity of the country
is the high individual character of
the average American citizen, no mat
ter whether his work be mental or
manual, whether he be farmer or
wage-worker, business man or profes
sional man.
Talks on Corporations.
Corporations are the first great sub
ject dealt with. He says he is not
opposed to corporations. Like trade
unions they have come to stay. Each
must be checked when they are not
doing good. He thinks their regula
tion possible under existing conditions
but if not the constitution must be
amended. The power to regulate must
be affirmative and given to some ad
ministrative body created by congress.
He says such a body should have the
power to judge of the reasonableness
of a railroad rate and to prescribe the
limit beyond which it shall be unlaw
ful to go. All decisions on rates must
be subject to revision by the courts.
He does not favor power being given
to originate rates, but to regulate
rates already fixed.
"I regard the power to establish
a maximum rate as being essential
to any scheme of real reform in the
'V-tter of railway regulation.
a\ \ private car lines, industrial
erii.Xs, refrigerator charges, etc.,
./should be controlled by the commis
sion.
Labor Question Taken Up.
Again recommends compulsory use
of block signals on interstate railroads
and recommend regulation of hours
of railroad workmen and the liability
of employers for injuries. He says
it would be unwise to deprive courts of
power of injunction in labor matters.
Recommends thorough investigation
of labor matters, child labor, healthy
factories, reasonable hours.
He recommends consideration of
federal supervision of insurance. He
says the needs and desires of the
people should be consulted on tariff
matters.
Says economy in expenditures is ab
solutely necessary this year. Advises
the addition of the element of elastic
ity to our currency.
He wants better business methods
in the various departments at Wash
ington. Also recommends supervision
of federal elections and campaign ex
penditures.
International Matters.
The various matters affecting inter
national law coming before the next
Hague convention are discussed at
length. He discussed the Monroe doc
trine as an aiu to the world peace and
in this connection the San Domingoan
situation.
Canal Funds Forthcoming.
The Hepburn bill, appropriating
$1G,500,000 for the canal, will pass
the house Thursday without reference
io committee, either by unanimous
consent or by special rule.
In this connection he also discussed
the army and navy. He recommends
general maneuvers and promotions
based on ability or seniority. rie
says increase the navy. Revision of
the naturalization and criminal laws
are recommended. He says public
land laws shosld be chamged to suit
cur needs today.
lb recommends to congress consid
eration of the Mississippi levees, mer
chant marine, Jamestown Tencennial,
care of confederate soldiers' graves.
He discusses at great length im
migration and its evils and the neces
sity of the revision of present laws.
He also considers the civil service
and its needs, copyright laws, adulter
ation of foods, smoke nuisance in
Washington, and national parks, rec
ommending an extension of Yellow
stone Park south and east. Life sav
ing stations and the Indians are also
dealt with.
He talks at length on the Philip
pines, their improvement and needs.
Cays the most encouraging feature is
i crease of school children from 300,-
000 to 500,000. He recommends free
trade between the United States and
the Philippines. He considers Porto
Rico and insular affairs in general.
Delegate for Alaska.
He earnestly asks for an elective
delegate for Alaska and recommends
that Oklahoma and Indian Territory
be admitted as one state and that
Kew Mexico and Arizona be admitted
as one state.
He goes into canal affairs, but says
he will recommend type at a later
date. He finishes with the recommen
dation for more adequate provision for
the state department.
BATTLESHIP IDAHO AFLOAT.
Successful Affair at Philadelphia Last
Saturday.
Philadelphia, Pa. —The battleship
Idaho slid off the ways at precisely
12:16 Saturday, and everybody agreed
that the affair was a huge success.
There was no hitch from the begin
ning to the end. Nothing marred the
program, and from the time the pretty
young sponsor, Miss Gooding, broke
a bottle of champagne on the bow of
the vessel, as she slid in the water
as graceful as a swan,"until the last
speech was made by Representative
French in the banquet hall nearby,
everything went like clockwork.
The launching was witnessed by the
greatest crowd that ever assembled at
the Cramp yards on such an event.
Idaho was particularly well repre
sented and considering the distance
between the two points made a sur
prisingly good showing.
The Idaho is a sister ship to the
Mississippi, which was launched on
September 30, and will be a battleship
of the first class. When finished sho
will be a conspicuous illustration oi
the important factor electricity has be
come in the operating of a modern
warship. Except for windlass and
steering gear practically all her other
auxiliary machinery will be run by
electricity and her two military masts
"-?11 be fitted with apparatus for wire
less telegraphy. The keel plates of
the Idaho were laid in May of last
year. Her specifications are:
Length on waterline, 375 feet; over
all, 382 feet; extreme beam, 77; trial
displacement on a draft of 24.8, 13,000
tons. The contract provides for a
speed of 17 knots. Motive power will
be furnished by twin screws, triple ex
pansion engines of a collective indicat
ed horsepower of 10,000, steam being
supplied to the cylinders by eight wa
ter boilers set in four wa'er tight
compartments. The main bs.tcry will
consist of four 12 inch breech loading
rifles mounted in two turrets; eight 8
inch breech loading rifles, mounted in
four turrets; eight 7 inch breech load
ing rifles placed behind casement ar
mor, and two 12 inch submerged tor
pedo tubes.
Secondary battery—Twelve 3 inch
six pounders, two 1 pounder automat
ics; two 1 pounder rapid fire guns, two
3 inch field pieces, two machine and
six automatic guns.
The main belt, side armored, will
be a strip nine feet three inches in
width, running the entire length, nine
inches thick amidships, gradually ta
pering to a thickness of four inches
fore and aft. The upper and lower
casemate armor amidships over the
main belt will be seven inches thick,
while the bulkhead terminals, in the
immediate vicinity of the 12 inch tur
ret barbettes, will have an armor of
the same thickness.

COMMISSIONER'S ANNUAL REPORT
SHOWS 1,026,499
Over Two Hundred Thousand More
Than Last Year—Pacific Ports Show
Decrease—On Account of Jap-Russo
War —Slavs and Huns Most Promi
nent—Fewer From Germany.
In presenting the annual report of
the bureau of immigration, Commis
sioner General Sargent refers to the
magnitude and gravity of the problems
presented by the growth of the alien
population of tue United States.
"These problems," he declared,
"loom so largely in the prospect of our
country that it may be said without
giving just cause to charge exaggera
tion, that all other questions of public
economy relating to things rather than
to human beings, shrink into compara
tive insignificance."
The total alien arrivals reported for
the year of 1,026,-*99 represents an in
crease over the preceding year of 213.-
629, of which the continental ports of
the United States report an increase of
1915,940, as compared with arrivals last
year, and Canadian ports 13,830. At the
insular ports the increase was 2849,
although the arrivals at Porto Rico
were less by 94 than in 1904. There
also was a large increase in arrivals at
southern ports, while a decrease is
shown for the Pacific ports, which is
accounted for in some measure by the
Russian-Japanese war.
Of the increased arrivals above re
ferred to. Austria-Hungary sent 98,537
over its quota of 1904, Russia 39,756,
Italy 28,183, and the United Kingdom
49,544. This increase from the last
mentioned country, says the commis
sioner, is somewhat offset by the de
crease from Germany, Switzerland and
Sweden. Notwithstanding the increase
from Italy, that country, says the com
missioner, may be regarded as having
probably reached the high water mark.
From this showing, Commissioner Sar
gent ventures the prediction that the
chief source of future increases in im
migration are those two in Europe
which have the greatest resources in
population, probably, to dispense with
—Russia and Austria-Hungaria.
SPORTING NOTES.

kicking quarterback of the University

PKLL.ICT DOOM OF BUREAUCRACY
"Quo Vadis" Author Fears Germans
May Absorb Poland.
Stockholm.—The Associated Press
correspondent recently had an inter
view with Henryk Sienkiewicz (author
of "Quo Vadis" and other well known
hooks) prior to his receiving the Nobel
prize for literature. The novelist said:
"I have not heen in Poland for three
weeks. The situation in Russia and in
Poland is extremely had. The bureau
cracy can not last much longer with or
without revolution. Its days are count
ed. The Russian people are good, but
the bureaucracy are a set of thieves.
That was proved by the war. Count
Witte's position is most difficult. Witte
is clever and of great ability, but it
is doubtful if he will be able to retain
his position.
"We are in the greatest danger as
Poles, and a German occupation of
Poland is possible if this revolutionary
movement gets beyond the control of
the Russian government. Perhaps such
occupation would be by consent of the
Russian government and perhaps not.
However, if the Russian government
should acquiesce in the occupation of
Russian Poland in whole or in part by
Germany the act would be resisted not
only in Poland, but in Russia.
ALL WARSAW IN FERMENT.
Rumor Has It That Citadel Garrison
Has Mutinied.
Warsaw, Dec. 11. —The ferment
among the troops is increasing. A
hundred soldiers of the Kexholm regi
ment headed a procession this morn

barred by a detactiment of the Grocho
wski regiment, the commander of
which ordered his men to fire. The sol
diers refused to do so, and permitted
the procession to pass. The command
ing officer then fled.
A rumor is current that the whole
garrison at Warsaw citadel has
mutinied.
Other reports declare that the gar
risons at Lodz, Lublen and other cities
in southern Poland are in a state of
mutiny.
Only the Cossacks remain loyal to
the government, and they are being
kept in service day and night dispers
ing meetings ot students and socialists.

Worst Sold in Nation.

quality of the stuff sold is getting
worse every year. New York spends
more than $1,000,000 a day for its al
coholic drinks. Purchased at retail,
this amount is about equal to what it
pays for meat and more than it spends
for bread and vegetables.
FAITH IN SANTA CLAUS.
I used to watch for Santa Claus
With childish faith sublime.
And liaten In the snowy night
To hear his sleigh bells chtiue.
Beside the door on Christinas *ve
I put a trnss of hay
To feed the prancing steed#
That sped him on his way.
I pictured him a Jolly man
With beard of frosty white.
And cheeks so fat that when he laughed
They hid his eyes from sight;
A heart that overflowed with love
For little cirls and bays.
And on his back a bulgfcg pack.
Brimful of gorgeous toys.
If children of a larger growth
Could hare a Christmas tree
From Father Time, one gift alone
Would be enough for me —
Let others take the gems and gold.
And trifles light and vain.
But give me back my old belief
In Santa Claus again!
—Life.
818 KMfIS IN ID.
BY JULES ADAMS POWELL.
IT was the day before Christmas.
Dame Yarrow stood in the store-room
doorway, gowned in a warm frock of
gray wool homespnn, over which was
tied an ample white apron. Her
white-capped head nodded as she counted
the pies on the shelves.
"Fifteen pumpkin—fifteen mince—fif
ty custard cupg and two plum puddings
—eighty-two in all, not counting Nan
nie's three little turnovers. I think that
will do for the holidays this year, though
Brother John is coming with those ten
boys and one little girl. How cold it is.
There is surely a storm brewing, and I
hope the folks will get here before it
breaks."
The good woman turned the key in
the lock, and a door blowing open just
at that moment, at the other end of the
pasageway, she hurried off to close it
and forgot about the key.
By 3 o'clock madame was robed in
her pretty gray poplin with white ker
chief crossed on her breast, and a dainty
white lace cap on her brown curls,
which would stray out from beneath the
cap band, and which Papa Yarrow slyly
pulled as he passed through the hall
where sat his wife and little daughter in
front of the blazing wood fire.
"All ready for company, Nancy
mine?" He caught the little one up in
his arms and kissed her on either cheek,
continuing: "And mother, too? Why
she looks as young as the day I saw
l er for the first time."
Farmer Yarrow put the little girl
down, glanced at his wife, who, with
drooping face, did not respond to his
merry speech.
Her husband, noticing this, bent over
her tenderly, with the words, "Yes. my
wife, our life has ben one of great hap
piness, marred only by one sorrow. If
he—our eldest child—our Henry—were
alive to-day, he would be a brave lad
of 17."
"John," for the first time his wife
raised her head and looked into his face,
her brown eyes filled with tears, "John,
sometimes, methinks our boy may yet
be alive. In the fight with the Indians,
we were told that he was carried away
by them, and even though the country
about was searched by scouts and others,
it might be that they saved his life, for
he was but a baby—s years old, and If
there was a woman in that tribe surely
she would have mother-heart enough to
preserve the life of an inocent babe who
had never done harm to any."
"Wife, wife, this is very wrong for
you to hope for the return of one who
has been so many years from us. lam
sure that our sou caunot be alive, or we
would have heard of him in some way.
Ah! I hear sleigh bells."
Catching Nannie up again, he turned
toward the window, and coming up the
driveway were seen three immense
sledges drawn by strong horses and filled
with merry faces, the owners of which
were soon clambering out. The front
door was thrown open, and Madame
Yarrow's tears vanished in the hearty
handshakings and embraces of sisters,
cousins and aunts.
Even Great-grandmother Hartwell
had come, for this year it was Mary
Yarrow's Christmas feast, and all had
come to make the old house ring with
joy and laughter until after New Year.
That night a merry crowd sat down at
the supper table. There was Brother
John Hartwell, his wife and eleven chil
dren. There was Great grandmother
Hartwell and her daughter-in-law.
Grandmother Hartwell. Mr. Yarrow's
father and mother were present, as were
also his two brothers and one sister with
their wives, husband and children. In
all there were thirty-three.
One might well wonder where all this
goodly company were to sleep, but if you
had gone into the great garret you would
have ceased wondering, when you saw
the trundle beds for the little ones. Of
course, the very smallest babies slept in
their mothers' rooms.
Christmas Eve the children were al
ways allowed ail extra half hour around
the fireside to listen to the stories of
their elders, while the corn popped and
chestnuts burned black, or else hopped
across the floor.
On this evening Nannie sat in her
favorite place on Cousin Roderick's knee.
Uncle Tom had just been saying that a
few days previous he had heard that
the Indians had been causing trouble
for the farmers. They were stealing
the hoarded corn and wheat, and in one
instance, after taking the grain, they
had set fire to the granary.
Cousin Rod saw the look of terror in
the eyes of some of the little ones, and
Interrupted with the words, '•Well, now,
Aunt Mary, wouldn't it be a great joke
If these hungry Reds should get into
your storeroom and carry off all those
pies and puddings I know you have
there for to-morrow?"
"Are they really so hungry, Cousin
Rod?" asked a little voice from his lap.
"Yes, dear, an Indian is always ready
to eat one out of house and home."
******
Late that night no one heard the
"pit-pat of tiny bare feet along the
dark, cold hall, as a little white figure
emerged from the attic, and flew down
txairs in the moonlight, which flooded
the house with Its kindly rays.
She went directly to the storeroom.
At the same instant a tall, dark form,
that had but a momemt before climbed
Into an unfastened window, stood rrnn»-
fixed with tear at the figure befort him,
but for the moment only, when, with a
fort of grunt, the man moved toward
the pantry door.
Nannit, beneath her breath, whispered,
"It's a Indian, an' he's come for my
turnovers. Cousin Hod f«aid he might."
She was frightened and stood very still
while the other fumbled with the look,
which soon yielded, and when Nannie
saw the man was really inside the pan
try, she turned and almost Hew back to
her father's room, where, standing oil
tiptoe, she whispered in his ear. "Fath
er! Father! A Indian is down in th«*
storeroom, stealin' my turnovers! Colli*
quick, father!
He did "go quick," and arrived just in
time to close the door of the storeroom,
and turn the key in its lock.
There was a pause, then a pounding
on the door. Hastily pushing a heavy
table against it, Mr. Yarrow returned
to his room; dressed, and calling two
other male members of the household,
they all marched to the storeroom well
armed, and without much trouble, soon
overpowered the thief, who proved to
be au Indian, and who mumbled some
thing that sounded like broken English.
They carried him out to the Miioke
house, which was built of stone, nod
had a heavy iron door. The three men
watched nearby the rest of the night.
At breakfast on this Christmas morn
ing. Father Yarrow told the story of th#
previous night, and Nannie had her full
share of caresses and praise from aunt
ies, uncles and cousins alike.
Then there was a clamor from the
youngsters to "see the prisoner;" so after
breakfast they all went forth to the tem
porary jail, Paine Yarrow among th#
others.
The great doors were pushed back,
and lying 011 the floor was tin- Indian,
asleep. But was it an IndianV Instead
of the straight black hair, his was brown
and curly.
Dame Yarrow gave one look, then
turned to her husband, with extended
hands, and the cry, "Oh, John, it is he!"
fell fainting into his arm*.
The lad was awakened and taken to
the house. He spoke English brokenly,
but conld give no account of his former
life, before he became one of a tribe of
half-friendly Indians.
He explained his being in the store
room by telling his hearers that hie
tribe of Indians that was encamped sev
eral miles above, on the river bank, had
been living on what they could steal from
the whites.
He bad ben sent out ou this night,
and seeing a window open in the back
of the Yarrow homestead he determined
to craw' in and view the premises.
Mrs. Yarrow knelt before him and
gazing searchingly into his eyes, which
were blue, asked over and over, "Don't
you know me, Harry, darling? I am
your mother." But he could not be
made to understand. Ho begged leave
to return to the tribe, saying he would
come back again with information.
This the men were inclined to believe
a trick to get away, but when Mrs. Yar
row pleaded for him they let him go.
All idea of church-going was aban
doned for tjie first time on Christmae
f>ay in the life of any member in that
household, and dinner awaited at the
bidding of madame until the return of
the youth. He was seen coming np the
walk at 3 o'clock in the afternoon, and
with him was an old Indian.
The following tale they all listened
to with great interest:
"In the great Indian fight of twelve
years before, the little captured boy wae
taken to the Indian encampment, aud
given to the care of a young squaw, the
favorite wife of the chief of the tribe.
"One day she overheard the chiefs
talking about the white man's child.
They said he had brought misfortune
to the Indians, as they had lost several
battles since lie had been with them, ho
