[reopen again next Wednesday. A
€ull investigation as to the smallpox
j scare shows that there is no further

Ily the school board has ordered the

There are sorife few that criticized
I the action of tire health officer in'
'dosing down the schools and the 1
i Daily World for publishing the facts
;as they existed.
j Acting on the theory that "in case
'of doubt, take the safe side." the
;. schools were closed. Who shall say j
l'that the action was not a proper one?

j Washington, Dec. 4.—Dr. N. G.
Blalock of Walla Walla, addressing
i the rivers and harbors congress, dem
j onstrated the remarkable fact that
! the Columbia and its confluents may
[be made navigable for 1,200 miles at
; small expense. His address follow
led the making public of President
| Roosevelt's message in which only th*
| Columbia and Mississippi rivers are
mentioned of all the streams of the
country. He cited the fact that only
one-tenth of the irrigable lands of
the country are now cultivated, yet
i the railroads are inadequate to han
dle the increasing traffic, so when tho
other nine-tenths are reclaimed the
congestion will be beyond comprehen
sion, stagnating industries worse than
now. He referred to 1,500,000 acres
or irrigable hinds along the Columbia
and Snake river valleys, from some
lof which $1,200 to the acre in prod
ucts is realized annually.
Pacific Northwest World Center.
In advocacy of improvement of the
Columbia river he urged that the pro
ject was not merely local, but of
I world-wide importance. The Pacific
ocean, he said, would be the theater
jof the world's greatest dramas in
time to come and that, necessarily,
the Pacific northwest would be th-3
' center of commerce of the western
i world. He said that the traffic be
tween the Occident and the orient
i would traverse the Columbia rver, be
cause t would seek the shortest route
Ito the orent from this country. He
'said that he spoke not merely as an
American, but as a citizen of the
; world, because believed Americans
[eventually would become a light, a
