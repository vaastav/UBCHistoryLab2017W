Dlsappearing Gam Carriages.
In order to correct an erroneous Im
pression which has gone abroad to the
effect that General Bufilngton, the prede
cessor of General Crozier as chief of the
army ordnance bureau, took advantage of
the pendency of the opposing recommnenda
tions as to the continuance of the dIsap
pearing gun carriage in the service, and
contracted for several of these carriages,
General Crozier states that the plans for
the guns ordered by Gen. Buffington were
specifically approved by Secretary Root,
who authorized that fourteen out-of fif
teen carriages for heavy guns should beof
the disappearing type.
MISChIEF JiAKER.
A SURPRISE IN BROOKLYN.
An adult-a food that can save a baby proves it
self to he nourishing and easily dlgested and good
for big and little folks. A Brooklyn man says:
"When baby was shout eleven months old he began
to grow thin and pale. This was, at first, at
tributed to the heat and the fact that his teeth
were coming, but, in reality, the poor lIttle thIng
was starving, his mother's milk not being sulient
tnourishmlent.
--One day after he had cried bitterly for am
hour, I suggested that my wite try him on Grape
Nuts. She soaked two teaspoonfula in a saucer
with a little stugar' and - warm milk, This baby
ate so ravenously that she lied a mecond, which
he likewise finished. It was not many days he.
fore he forgot all abeut being nursed and has
since lived almost escluaively on Grape-Nuts. To
day the hey is strong and robust, and as eute a
mischief-maker as- a thirtefn-monthased baby is
espected to be.
"We have pat before him other fools, but he
will have none of them, evidently preferring to
stick to that which lid him so -maicb qood in his
time of need-his old friend Grapats.
"Use this letter ay way Tyen wish, for mny wife
and I can never praise Grape-Nuts enough after
the Vrightness it has breught to our household.
These statements earn be verineC by any one who
wishes to make a visit to our boee" F. . Me

EARTHqUAKE IN ERZERUM.
Fear of Falling Walls Drives People
Into Tents.
An acc;unt of a serious earthquake in
Erzerum, Turkey, November 8, is contained
in a dispatch just received at the State De
partment from Vice Consul Ojalvo at Er
zerum. He says that the first shock, though
strong, did not disturb the people much; the
second was of less force, but the third drove
the people from their houses. The last
shock brought down-a shower of stones and
plaster from roof and walls and the peo
ple were compelled to put up tents on the
snow in the streets. During the day other
shocks occurred with more or less force, re
sulting in the destruction of many houses,
the death of twenty persons and the in
jury of fifteen. , %
In the evening the governor general sent
two tents for the use of Mr. Ojalvo and his
family and servants. The vice consul says
that the coldness of the nights compelled
them to put up temporary huts to protect
themselves against the inclemency of the
weather. -The damage to the United States
consulate was considerable and the vice
consul was only able to save the typewriter
and registers from the office. The can
vasses are full of fear and dare not enter
the building.
Up to the time the dispatch was forward
ed there had been fourteen heavy shocks
and a large number of lighter ones. Re
port has it that 200 houses have been de
strqyed and a large number of others ren
dered uninhabitable.
Consul Ojalvo evidently forwarded his dis
patch before the danger was entirely over.
"It looks as though." said he, "we may be
compelled to remain in tents during the
winter, and if so I beg the department to
allow me to take my family to Trebizond or
some safe place for the winter. The con
suls of the various powers here were t1i1
yesterday in tents, but as the mercury is
steadily dropping and the snow is still fall
ing they are today building huts for the
winter. I hope to be able to report with
the next mail improvements in this great
distress. It will be preferable to take the
consulate to Trebizond for the winter."
