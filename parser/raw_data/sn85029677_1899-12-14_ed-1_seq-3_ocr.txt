Clash Over Inspection Fee.
The government and the state live
: stock inspector at Coffey ville clashed
over authority. The Kansas state live
stock sanitary board passed an order
-directing their local inspectors to col
lect an inspection fee of three cents a
.head upon all cattle entering Kansas,
-whether destined to Kansas points or
mot. The government, on the other
band, issued an inspection permit re
lieving the cattle from all restrictions
-excepting1 those applied at the point of
destination. The shippers, relying
upon their government permits, refuse
io pay the inspection fee of three cents
--a head, holding that as the cattle mere
ly pass through Kansas to attempt to
restrict their passage is interference
"with interstate commerce.
A Sew "Convict Cemetery."
Warden Tomlenson, of the Kansas
"penitentiary, has a force of prisoners
moving the convict graveyard. The

ior the prison brick plant. The new
cemetery is on a ridge a quarter of a
mile southeast of the prison walls. In
-all 130 bodies of convicts have been
"buried in the Kansas penitentiary
.-graveyard. Every body except one is
that of a convict. The exception is
"that of a stranger who died near the
walls, where he was trying to seek
shelter from the cold two years ago.
This graveyard for convicts was started
4$6 years ago.

KANSAS EVENTS.
Waited Sixteen Tears.
One day in 1S83, Saber, the two-year-old
daughter of Mr. Bouse, a section
foreman on the 'Frisco railroad in
Cherokee county, wandered away from
the house and lay down on the railroad
track. Soon she was fast asleep, and
she did not waken until a freight traits
came along and cut off one of hesr legs
just below the knee. Nothing' was
ever done in the way of holding the
railroad responsible for damages, and
little Saber grew into happy girlhood
and then attractive womanhood in
spite of her sad disfigurement. Just
before the date of her eighteen th birth
day, however, she was advised by some
one to bring suit against the railroad
for damages, and last week the attor
neys of the company were notified that
action had been commenced in the
court of Cherokee county for $30,000.
He Saw Edlinger Killed.
Ed and George Smith, of Cedar coun
ty, Mo., and Amos Phillips, of Rich
Hill, are confined in jail at Fort Scott,
charged with being implicated in the
killing of Leopold Edlinger on Mill
creek, near Fort Scott. Phillips made

and the two Smiths and Edlinger
camped together at night; that he was
awakened during the night by the
firing of a gun, and that upon investi
gation he found that the two Smiths
had murdered Edlinger.
Objects to Short Skirts.
Superintendent of Schools Wolfe, of
Kansas City, Kan., has aroused the 150
teachers under him almost to the point
of open rebellion by promulgating a
rule forbidding the wearing of short
skirts in school. When the golf skirt
"came in" the teachers thought it
would be a very serviceable garment
for the school room. . It would not
sweep up the dust from the floor and'
it had many other advantages over
long skirts.
Two Years for Township Officers.
C. J. Wilbur, of Osage county, has
inaugurated a movement to reform the
present system of electing township
officers. He claims that the present
term of one year is not long enough,
even with the assurance of a second
term, to accomplish much. The busi
ness of a township board, he says, is
more diversified than most people
think, and it takes time to gain experi
ence. He wants them elected for two
years.

ROBERTS ANSWERED.
A Delegation at Washington, Representing
the Gentile Element in Utah, Op
poses the Polygamist.
Washington, Dec. 9. A lengthy
answer to Mr. Brigham Robert's ad
dress to the American people was made
yesterday by a delegation representing

here to oppose Mr. Roberts. It makes
the assertion, among other points, that
the compact between Utah and the
other states as evidenced by many
public acts of the authorities of Utah
has been violated by Mr. Roberts.
That Mr. Roberts himself understood
that compact to mean the discontinu
ance of unlawful cohabitation, the
answer points to his registration oath
of 1835, in which he swore it to be his
intention to obey the law prohibiting
unlawful cohabitation.

case by proving that the bets were
registered in a real book with leaves
and binding. The information pleaded
that the bets were made by means of a
"book" and the court held that this
was not sufficicient. The state at
tempted to show that a "book" could be
made without a sheet of paper or a
cover, but the court said he could not
take judicial cognizance of a cant ex
pression or gambler's phrase and he
would have to hold that the word
"book" meant a book.

Washington, Dec 7. Gen. Otisyester .
3ay cabled the war department that be
has had no word from Gen. Young for
a week. This is taken to indicate that
Young is continuing his hot pursuit of

AN OLD RUMOR REVIVED.
Washington Officials Skeptical as to the
Ability of Consul Wlldman to Per
suade Aguinaldo to Surrender.
Washington, Dec 7. Relative to the
rumor from Hong Kong that Aguinal
do is willing to surrender to Consul
Wildman, it is learned that, though the
consul himself has cherished that be
lief for some months past, the govern
ment has been without any assurance
of the soundness of his conclusions.
Mr. Wildman is not the only official
representing the United States in the
far east who has expressed confidence
in his ability to persuade Aguinaldo to
cease hostilities, but for some reason
the administration has always- been
somewhat skeptical as to these under
takings. The report from Hong Kong
is believed to be nothing more than a
revival of some of the old rumors.
