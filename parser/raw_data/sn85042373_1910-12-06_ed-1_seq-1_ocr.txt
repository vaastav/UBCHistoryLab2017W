HIGH EXPLOSIVES
Government Wants Material for Sub

Washington, Dec. 6.—A new high
explosive for submarine mines, which
would play havoc with the war ves

the cost artillery corpse. The new
explosive will not Bupplant all the
other forms of ammunition for mines

it is impossible for army officials to

Document of Unusual Length

Congress
DOT HUGH CONFIDENCE
III CARRYtNG IT PLANS
Not Much Attention Paid to Reading
After the First Few Sentences But
Members Studied the Printed Copies
Closely.
}r
Washington, Dec. 6—Congress gave
respectful attention to President Taft'a
message today but there were com
paratively few members who were
willing to concede the probability of
favorable action at the present ses
sion on the many recommendations
contained therein. The general opin
ion was that time would not permit of
action, in view of the fact that the
session will close March 4.
The message waa delivered to both
houses by Secretary Latta soon aft
er they convened at noon. The sec
retary made his first appearance in
the senate, arriving Immediately aft
er the announcement of the presi
dent's Intention to communicate his
views in writing. This annoucement
was made by Senator Cullom on be
half of himself and Senator Money,
who constitutes the senatorial com
mittee to inform the president that
the senate was prepared to receive
any recommendations from him. Al
most Immediately afterward Secretary
Latta delivered the message to the
house.
The reading of the document, which
was of unusual length, was begun at
12:19 p. m„ in the senate. At first
most of the senators listened atten
tively to the reading but gradually
this attention ceased on the part of
most of them and those who remained
in tihe chamber devoted themselves
to the printed copies before them. In
the house close attention,at first was
paid to the reading clerk. The in
terest soon lagged, however, and
those who remaned in thafr eeate fcid
so to study the printed copies that
had been pl6cedone*6ry desTc.'
(The message in full is found on
pages 10 to 14 inclusive of this issue
of the Times.)
Fewer Bills.
Fewer bills and resolutions were
introduced in the house yesterday
than is usual on the opening day of
congress. There were thirty-six pub
lic bills and resolutions.
As an outcrop of the house commit
tee investigation of Indian contracts,
Mr. Burk. of South Dakota, chairman
of that committee, introduced a meas
ure requiring the approval of congress
in. order to establish validity of future
contracts or agreements made by per
sons with Indians or Indian tribes
concerning litigation predicted on any
claim against the United States in
volving land title and possession and
the right to annuities.
Other measures introduced were:
Mr. Loud of Michigan, appro
priating $135,000 for completing and
furnishing the crypt of (he Annapolis
naval academy chapel as a permanent
resting place for John Paul Jones by
Mr. Bartholdt of Missouri, appropriat
ing $2,500 as the United States' share
of the maintenance of the inter-par
liamentary union bureau for the pro
motion of international arbitration at
Brussels and by Mr. Sheppard of
Texas, requiring heads of departments
to submit their reports more prompt
ly for the information of congress.
Considerable discussion occurred
among members of the house over the
possible outcome of the controversy
concerning the manner of selecting
committees in the next congress. Dem
ocratic leaders, however, sought to
minimize any controversial develop
ments and pointed out that in the near
future Champ Clark, the probable next
speaker, would bring about a confer
ence between Democrats representing
all sides of the question as to elec
tion or appointment of committees.
Immediately after the convening of
the senate today the oath of office
was administered by the vice presi
dent to Claude A. Swanson, successor
of John W. Daniel, as senator from
Virginia, Joseph M. Terrell, successor)
of Senator Clay of Georgia, and La
fayette Young, successor to Senator!
Dolllver of Iowa. The credentials of|

of chemicals. Mr. Hemple was in the
act of mixing a quantity of nitric acid
and quicksilver when the solution ex

Secretary's Estimates Show
a Material Decrease and
May Reach $8,135,827
Washington, Dec. 6.—The estimates
of Secretary of the Navy Meyer for
the fiscal year 1912, which show a
saving of $6,000,04)0, provide for an
expenditure of $8,135,827 for public
works at the navy yards and stations.
These are for items regarded as es
sential and are based upon a person
al inspection of the navy yards and
stations.
Some of the estimates for public
works are as follows:
New York navy yard, $1,469,000
Pearl Harbor, Hawaiian islands,
naval station, $2,287,000 Boston navy
yard, $277,000 marine barracks, Bos
ton, $148,000 Norfolk navy yard,
$347,500 Olongape, Philippines, naval
station, $300,000 Philadelphia navy
yard, $227,000 marine barracks,
$290,000 Portsmouth, N. H., navy
yard, $129,000 Puget Sound navy
yard, $989,000 Washington, D. C.,
navy yard, $134,500.
The secretary says that to construct
the collier which congress directed
shall be built at..a government navy
yard on the Pacific coast, It will be
necessary for congress to increase the
limit of cost from $1,000,000 to $1,
600,000, of which $531,000 should be
appropriated for next year.
The secretary a|ks,. tor $7,630,000
for provisions iorVi-.e' iiavy.
As the first year's appropriation for
the new vessels' the secretary names
$6,090,000 as necessary for construc
tion and machinery and $6,750,428 for
armor and armament, which .is $3,
494,194 less than the amount appro
priated for the new building program
this year. In addition he recommends
$10,453,619 for the continuation oi
work on vessels now under construc
tion, which is $6,9S2,105 less than the
amount appropriated for a similar
purpose this year.
While increases have been made in
the estimates for the pay of the navy
and marine corpB and under the head
of ordinance and other war equip
ment, the decreases exacted in other
directions, especially in the construc
tion of ships, bring the total down
sufficiently to effect a saving of $5,
006,000.
The total amount which will be
submitted to congress for the navy
department under the naval, legisla
tive and sundry civil bills for next
year will be $127,067,329 as compared
with $132,378,9S0 for this year or a
decrease in exact figures of $5,311,
651.

New Haven, Conn., Dec. 6.—Theo
dore Roosevelt has written to Gover
nor-elect Simon E. Baldwin several
times since the election of November
8, it is understood, but the letters
have been returned. There has been
no definite adjustment of the con
troversy which arose over Col. Roose
velt's criticism of Judge Baldwin's
alleged attitude towards the working
men's compensations laws, but mu
tual friends are said to be trying to
bring about a reconciliation. Col.

chamber of commerce, has been in
correspondence with Roosevelt in or
der to pave the' way for the accept
ance by Judge Baldwin of an invita
tion to address the chamber at Its

It is stated that Judge Baldwin in
sists that a public statement must
come from Roosevelt touching upon

NEWlLliT
Has Brilliant Rose Color and
Was Christened Morganite
By Highbrows
New York, Dec. 6.—A newly discov
ered ge mof brilliant rose color was
christened Morganite last night by the
New York academy of sciences. It
was named for J. Pierpont Morgan, on
the suggestion of Dr. George P. Kunz.
chairman of the geological section of
the academy. Dr. Kunz thought that
Mr. Morgan had earned the honor by
the encouragement which he has given
art and science in America and
Europe.
Morganite, Dr. Kunz said, is a spe
cies of beryl. "It was discovered in
its perfection In the present year," he
continued, "and differs from other
beryls in that It flouresces an intense
cherry red when exposed to Roentgen
rays. It is found principally in the
mountainous region of Mount Bity, an
island off the coast of Madagascar."
Edmond Mulchay and Frank Belcher,
also important members of (he Chi
cago engagement, are to be heard
here as is Margaret Crawford in the
contralto role. The orchestra and
chorus are also brought entire from
the New York and ChicaRO engage
ments. Among the other singers are
Hon Bergere, a Hungarian grand op
era singer of much reputation Ar-1
I thur Grover, the leading English bar
itone singer of light, roles, and Geo.'
Lyding in the difficult tenor role. I
Few operettas since the splendid
days of Audran, Milloeeker and Often-i
bach have been so imperative in the
demands for character impersonation!
as well as unusual vocal ability in its
players as is "The Chocolate Soldier."
Kven before the original production
in Berlin Mr. Whitney had secured!
the rights for all countries except'
Germany, but not until last, year was
he sufficiently satisfied with his gath
ering of singers to produce the work
and vocally express this musical won
der-work of Oscar Straus.
THE PRESIDENT
Not Seeking to Offend the In
surgents in Supreme Court
Appointments
Washington. Dec. 6.—At the close
of a white house day. given over to a
series of conferences, attended by both
regular and insurgent Republicans,
Senator Cummins of Iowa, leader of
the senate insurgents, after an ab
sence of more than a year from the
executive offices, yesterday visited the
president, at the latter's invitation.
With him was Senator Borah of Ida
ho, one of the militant insurgents of
the upper house. The president con
ferred with the two senators, and
later spoke a short time with each of
them alone.
Although the conference was her
alded by those not entirely familiar
with what actually occurred, as an
important step toward cementing the
Republican factions in congress, it
could not be given that exact inter
pretation. While it may prove to be
the initial move on the part of the
president to bring about more har
monious relations between the admin
istration and the insurgent element,
the fact of the matter is, that when
the president summoned Cummins,
Senator Borah and Senator Bristow,
it was for the purpose primarily of
conferring with them upon supreme
court appointments.
Such discussion as took place con
cerning legislation was subordinate,
and even may have been incidental to
the main purpose.
Still the fact that Mr. Taft called in
men conspicuous In the insurgent
movement may reasonably be de
scribed as the extension of the olive
branch to an element of the Republl
I can party which has not been co-oper
ating to any appreciable extent with
the main body of the party or with
the administration. Senator Cummins
and Senator Borah accepted the invi
tation, but Senator Bristow did not ap
pear, although the reason was not dis
closed it may be, however, that he
was not reached in time to call when
his colleagues had their talk with Mr.
Taft. The president himself author
ized the announcement that he had
summoned the senators named for the
purpose of discussing judicial appoint
ments.
Justiceships Discussed.
In the western section of the coun
try live eight or ten men who are am
bitious to become members of the su
preme court, and quite naturally the
president does not wish to invite op
position to the confirmation of any
appointee to the bench from such a
powerful coterie of senators as the
insurgents, or progressives, as they
prefer to be denominated.
The insurgents are displaying a
lively interest in the manner in which
Mr. Taft is going to fill the two va
cancies, chiefly for the reason that
they are concerned over the passage
of progressive legislation, whose con
stitutionality will have to be passed
upon by the supreme court.
Senator Borah, for example, has
long been an ardent advocate of an
income tax, and he would object to the
appointment of a new justice whose
known views are to the effect, that
such a tax would not bo valid. It
happens that several men who have
been mentioned for the bench, have
expressed definite opinions on this
subject, which are .at variance with
those entertained by Borah, as well as
other senators who are not classified
as conservatives. The Idaho senator
availed himself of the opportunity of
fered yesterday to express his objec
tion to certain men on the list which
was canvassed during the conference.
Cummins also has favored an income
tax, not through the medium of a con
stitutional amendment, but without
recourse to such a method, on the
theory that congress now possesses
the power to make such a levy.
Since the president does not desire
to antagonize such senators In the
filling of the supreme court vacancies,
it is quite likely that several names
were scratched off the list of eligibles,
after his talk with Senators Borah
and Cummins, although no informa
tion as to their identity has as yet
been vouchsafed.
However, the president himself is
not keen about appointing men to the
bench who would be likely to be re
actionary in their interpretation of
laws which have been or will be
passed during this administration
consequently, he manifested a sym
pathetic Interest in the demurrer of
his senatorial callers to the aspira
tions of certain conspicuous western
men, one of whom is a well known
senator, and another a well known
Judge.
