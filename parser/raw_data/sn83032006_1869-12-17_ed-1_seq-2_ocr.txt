I KDFORD, FA., FfiIDAT, DEC. 11, 1860.
THE PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE.
The message was sent to our readers last
week before wc had time to read it or com
ment upon it. It is a document that will
add to the popularity of the President.
The argument of the special pleader tad the
harangue of the political demagogue fiud
no place in it. Its merit consists in its mat
ter of fact, plain, straightforward style of
treating every subject to which the Presi
ident felt it his duty to call the attention of
Congress. Each question is stated briefly
and distinctly and the opinion of the Presi
dent is so plainly expressed that no one is
left ID doubt. These are considerations of
the very first importance in official docu
ments, and few, if any, previous messsages
have possessed them in a higher degree.
Again the message is in full accord with
the spirit and principles of the party in pow
er, and gives us the assurance that its good
common sense will be practically carried out
by the legislative branch of the Govern
mcnt. If any one has feared that the Pres
ident would be found wanting on the Re
construction question his bold and righteous
recomtncndation in regard to the Georgia
Legislature will certainly set all their fears
at rest. The recommendation in regard to
the currency and resumption of specie pay
ments cannot but meet the hearty approval
of all who have not disregarded the teach
ings of experience and the facts of history
both in our own and other countries. Those
who have most deeply studied the history of
finance and the efforts of other nations to re
sume, under similar circumstances, are fully
assured that we are approaching specie pay
ments as fast as is either advisable or prac
ticable, if we wish resumption to be perma
nent when it does come. In fact all that
part of the message in reference to the
finances is franght with the suggestions of
practical common sense and stands in mark
ed contrast wiili the fanciful theories of
our would be financiers. Repudiators will
fed small encouragement, when they find
the executive placing first of all on onr li.-t
of imperative duties the necessity for "strict
integrity in fulfilling all our obligations;"
and those, who hoped to find our chief mag
istrate upholding cas'e, will scarcely relish
the assurance that second only to our finan
cial good faith is placed the imperative duty
"to secure protection to the pa son and prop
erty of the citizen of the I hited States in
each mid every portion of our copvmon CMB j
try, wherever he may choose io more, without
reference to original nationality, religion,
color or politics, demanding of him only
obedience to the laics and proper respect for
ike rights of others.'" The emphatic and
special recommendation to abolish the
Franking Privilege (abuse it were better
called) will meet the hearty approval of
every' honest man. Wc hope to see Con
gress act promptly on this important recom
mendation. There is but one point upon
which the message diverges from a policy
that all must approve—the recommenda
tion to increase the salaries of certain offi
cials. It is no doubt true that the salaries
of such officers as judges of the Supreme
Court and a few others are not commensa
rate with the ability required nor the duties
exacted by their positions; yet they are suf
ficient to maintain them in comfort as long
as they are content to live in that Rcpubli-1
ean simplicity that should characterize the
officials of a Democratic government. Be
sides, the expense of living, which had
largely increased during the war, is now rap
idly declining and each day the necessity for
increased salaries on that account becomes
less. This is certainly not the time to in
crease the salaries of public officers. With
this single exception we think the message
in full accord with the w. :.is and wishes of
the great mass of the people of all parties.
If the legislation of the Congress just assem
bled meets the approval of ail classes as well
as the message, it will be the most popular
that has ever yet assembled at the National
Capital. It has been a long time since Con
gress, President and people have so nearly
coincided in their \iewsof public policy,
and we hope it 5t.,,11 not be our lot to record
any change in this respect for a long time to
conic. We des'rj no more gratifying task
than to contrast present harmony with past
discord. Surely things augur well for the
peace and prosperity of our whole country.
THE TARIFF IN CONGRESS.
President Grant exhibited both good
judgment and sound sense in adVising no
interference with the tariff at present, nor
until the funding of the debt at a lower
rate of interest had been accomplished.
The tariff is the least burihcnsome and
least expensive form of collecting revenue,
while it at the same time is made to foster
and build up our manufacturing and agri
cultural industries. Wc hope Congress will
heed the advice ol the President and if it
is found at all advisable, to reduce the
revenue, which we think very doubtful,
lot it be done iu the Internal Revenue de
partment, where, it will lighten the bar
thens of die people directly and where the
expense of collection is heaviest. No grea
ter calamity could befall our country at
present than such a redaction of the tariff
as would prostrate our industry. In no
period of our history has our whole coun
try known snch industrial activity and
such rapid progress in wealth and strength
as in the past six or seven years under our
present protective tariff. It would be an
unpardonable blunder, and little less than
industrial suicide to interfere with or ma
terially reduce the rates of a tariff that has
brought us such extraordinary prosperity
in so short a space of time. We trust Con
gress will hesitate long before it in anyway
interferes with our present tariff rates.
THE Tribune is still advocating a reduc
tion of the duty on coal. As it can do no
body any good, and may do much harm, we
do hope Greeley will ecase his inconsistency
and stand up squarely for protection to coal
as well as every other interest that requires
the fostering care of government. Nothing
ean be more silly than the advocacy of the
reduction of the duty on coal, because the
anthracite operators combined, some time
ago, to raise the price of that article, as ev
ery ono knows that no anthraeite coal is im
ported and that a reduction of the duty
could in no way interfere with the profits of
the anthraeite business. Consumers of Coal
at that time turned to the bituminous coal
operators for relief and obtained it, and now
they would show their gratitude by redu
cing the duty on soft coal and injuring the
business of the operators from whom they
sought and obtained relief in their time of
trouble. Let usjaear no more of the reduc
tion of the duty on coal: it ean only work
mischief.
THE Fenians in Ireland are still turbulent,
giving the British Government so much
trouble that the habeas corpus is likely to
be suspended and additional troops to be
sent theie in order to preserve peace and
quiet.
THE Post Office Department is again ex
ercising its inventive ingenuity in devising a
new series of postage stamps, which like all
former ones is to be '"more appropriate and
elegant in all respects than any hitherto is
sued by any nation in the world." As near
as we are able to judge, from former efforts
in this direction, the department is already
suffering from inventive debility caused by
over exertion in getting up the present miser
able failure in the shape of stamps. Won't
they have the goodness to spare ns, yet
awhile, from any further infliction in the way
of abortive efforts at malting a respectable
stamp.
REDUCTION OF THE PUBLIC DEFT. —
Governor Geary in his proclamation on the
Uth, shows that Two Millions Eighty-eight
Thousand Four Hundred and Sixty-nine
Dollars of the Public Debt for the year end
ing the 30th November, 1869, has been paid
by the Commissioners —$1,725,587,97 inter
est, and $362,762.0* of the principal. Thus
we see that under a Republican administra
♦ion the public debt of the Keystone State
is rapidly decreasing every year. Great
credit is due to the officers of the State who
have had charge of her finances.
GENERAL SHERIDAN poured a full broad
side into the ranks of Copperheadism the
other day at Cincinnati. " The man that is
good enough to share my dangers on the
battle-field, as willing to die there, if need
be, as myself, is good enough to stand up
beside mo and vote." That is a pretty bit
ter pill for the men who skeedaddled to Can
ada and left the negro to fight their conn
try's battles. If Sheridan's opinion is of
any value he thinks the negro that wore the
"blue" possesses a better clahn to the bal
lot than any skulking Copperhead.
HON 1). J. MORRELL has prepared a
bill for funding the national debt at a lower
rate of interest and to adopt a system of
free banking which is meeting with much
favor and will no doubt be adopted before
the Session closes. The first will lighten the
public burthens and improve the public
credit, and the second will promote the
public prosperity more than any other
single act that Congress can pass. We
hope to see both become laws at an early
day.
Great diversity of opinion exists upon the
question of extending the Income tax.
Some advocate its utter abolition, some a
redueiion of the rates and others the exemp
tion of all under two thousand dollars in
stead of one thousand as at present. It is
impossible to predict at present what the
result will be when it comes up for decision.
The (Ecumenical Council assembled at
Rome on the Sth inst. Some of the most
eminent Bishops will oppose the dogma of
the Papal infallibility. Demonstrations have
occurred, both for and iu opposition to the
Council, in France and Spain.
THE British show a disposition to re-open
ncgotiatious on the Alabama claims. The
President's message may afford them a few
hints on that subject when they approach
it again,
THF. proposition to grant government
subsidies to American lines of ocean
steamers is meeting with much favor as
one of the most effective measures for re
storing American commerce.
IT is predicted that the Suez canal will
prove a failure as a financial enterprise, how
ever successful it may prove as a commer
cial one.
THE Cardiff giant has been transported to
New Y'oik, but scientific men persist in
treating him as a humbug of the first magni
tude.
THE Spanish gunboats have been releas
ed, the Peruvian minister having withdrawn
his objections, before the matter came up
for discussion in the courts.
THE Havana papers predict that brown
sugar wiil be worth forty cents per jround
before another year.
Xl,lst CONGRESS-SECOND SESSION.
SENATE.
The Senate met on Monday Dec. Cth at
noon, with fifty-five members present. Sen
ator Grimes' resignation was received, and
Mr. Lot M. Morrill from Maine was sworn
in. Credentials of Virginia Senators were
presented and laid on the table. In the
House, delegates from New Mexico, Wash
ington Territory, Wyoming and Montana
were sworn in and presented. A bill to pro
vide for taking the census, and one to re
lease pork and beef packers from tax as
manufacturers, were introduced. On the
7th in Senate Mr. Sumn r, of Massachu
setts, introduced a bill to amend the Bank
ing act and to promote the return to specie
payments. It repeals the limitation of the
amount of national bank notes and directs
the Secretary of the Treasury to i-sue addi
tional notes, equal in amount to the green
backs retired, but not to exceed fifty mil
lions ycailv.
In the House the time was spent in dis
cu-smg the President's message. In the
Seuuio on the Sth, the joint resolution for
the relief of persons engaged in the lale re
bellion, providing that upon the final adop
tion of the Fifteenth Amendment all disa
bilities shall cease, was taken up and dis
cussed. In the House, the bill to provide
for taking the Ninth Census, to fix the
number of members of the House of Repre
sentatives, and provide for their future ap-
I ort ion went among the States, was taken
up and discussed the remainder of the day.
Nothing of importance nor particular in
terest was done in the Senate on the 9th,
quite a number of bills were introduced and
discu-sed. but no action taken. After the
morning hour, the whole of the day was
spent in the House in discussing the census
bill. A great diversity of opinion exists
among the members as to the proper mode
of taking it, the Democrats thinking they
ought to have a share of the spoils.
The Senate had no Session on the 10th.
In the House the following bills were in
troduced :
One to establish uniform naturalization
throughout the United States.
One to repeal the law requiring farmers
to take out license to sell their own products
from stalls or stands.
One for the sale of coin in the treasury
except an amount necessary for payment on
bonds.
One to provide for the sale of all the eoin
in the treasury except such as may be
necessary for the payment of the interest on
bonds.
One for a reduction of the expenses of
obsequies of Congressmen.
And one instructing the Committee on
Foreign Affairs to inquire into the condi
tions under which the French cable company
holds its concession from the French govern
ment to connect its telegraph by the French
shore, and whether there is any restriction
or reservation in such concession that is
prejudicial to the rights of the Government
or the people of the United States, etc.
The House went into committee of the
whole on the state of the Union, and re
sumed the consideration of the census bill.
Mr. Kelley wanted to strike out of the 4th
section the proviso, that in any city com
prising more than one Congressional dis
trict. the Secretary of the Interior may ap
point one district superintendent, instead of
one for each Congressional district. After
considerable discussion the proviso was
stricken out
Mr. Lawrence offered an amendment au
thorizing the Secretary of tho Interior, at
his discretion, to call for the statistics now
on schedules.
Mr. Seofield moved a test question, tbat
the enacting clause of the bill be stricken
out.
The House rejected the amendment by a
decided vote.
Mr. Ward presented a petition, signed by
seventy-two thousand citizens of the State
of New York, asking Congress to accord
belligerent rights to the people of Cnba, and
to recognize their independence. He asked
that it be read.
Mr. Farosworth and others objected to
the reading.
Mr. Ward then withdrew the petition,
announcing that he would on Monday move
to suspend the rules so as to have it read.
A motion to adjourn till Monday was re
jected and the House at 3:45, adjourned till
to-morrow.
To morrow came, but nothing of con
sequence was done.
In the House on the 13th Mr. Dawes
moved that the Committee on Accounts
be directed to report what money had been
drawn from the House contingent fund
during the vacation. Agreed to.
Mr. Davis, asked to call up the resolution
asking the President what farther legisla
tion is necessary to secure better neutrality
in case of war between the European counties
and the American colonies. Lost.
Mr. Ward, of New York, asked permis
sion to present a petition from citizens of
New York praying for the recognition of
Cuban independence. The rules were sus
pended and the petition referred to the
Committee on Foreign Affa'rs.
Mr. Paine offered a resolution denying
tho legality of the law of 1846 retroceding
the city of Alexandria to the State of
Virginia, and denying the claims of Louis
M'Kenzie to a seat in Congress from the
Eiventh district of that State, because the
citizens of Alexandria county were not
citizens of Virginia, and therefore have no
right to vote for member of Congress.
The resolution was objected to.
Mr. Cox, of New York, presented a
petition from A Walker and others, ask
ing that coal be admitted free of duty. It
was referred to the Committee of Ways and
Means.
The House then went into committee-of
the whole and took up the census bill,
during the debate on which the House ad
journed.
NEGRO RISING IN CUBA.
Discovery of the I'lot—Brutal Torture of
the. Victims —Flogging Extraordinary—
The Details—Progress of the IFur.
By the steamer De Soto, jnst arrived
from Havana, the following letter has been
received in this City, viz. :
MACOIIJES, NOV. 29, 1869.—0n the Ist
of Dext month 4<X volunteers from the first
battalion of Matanzas will leave for the
Alduma's sugar estate, where they will be
quartered to guard tho same; staff and head
quarters at Santa Rosa, which is a mag
nificent plantation.
The rising ol the negroes at Quemados,
i Caruhatas) which Triilo, the Governor of
Sagua, pretends to have discovered, has
taken place upon the following estates, viz.:
"San Isidro." belonging to More & Ajuria;
"Lueardita," to Vattellano; "Santa Ter
era," to Coppinger; "Esperanza,'' to
Alfonso, "San Francisco," to the Count
O'Reillcy; "Margarita." to Francisco Ar
menteras; "Capricho," to Bias Muro, and
the "Eco," to Stocker, which together con
tain about 1,700 negroes. All the hands,
both free and slaves, upon the eight estates
referred to, have been horribly flogged (and
afterward made to give their evidence at
the "Santa Terero." Three of the number
were shot, one was flogged on three different
occasions, receiving in all 800 lashes, and
one of the best negroes on the place, a
vigorous man, was whipped almost to death,
and amid his sufferings, while repeatedly
fainting and fabing to the ground from
sheer weakness, was made to declare what
he knew.
Another, upon receiving the order to lie
down and submit to be tied and receive
punishment, fell senseless. Nevertheless,
he received 1,000 lashes without the slight
est sign of life. A Creole negro, suspected
to be, though not implicated in the plot,
received 1,200 lashes.
The hands of the estates were collected to
gether upon the Ksperanza, and there, in
the presence of 2,000 negroes, the ringlead
ers of the conspiracy were flogged in gangs
of twenty-one at a time, two executioners
being detailed for each victim.
At the same place nine were shot, and in
the punishment inflicted no distinction was
made between free and slave.
A cartload of the chastised frecdmen ar
rived at Sagua la Grande, headquarters of
the district, and were thrown into jail, lying
with their laces down because their wounds
prevented them from assuming any other
position. The head physician of the charity
hospital called there to see them, and de
clared that it was useless to treat their
wounds, because he was sure that they
would all die, and added that if they were
carried to the hospital it would only be to
soil the wards. These sufferers were nine
in number and near death; but it is well
understood that if any of them miraculous
ly survive it will be to be shot.
A white man, accused of incendiary in
tentions, was condemned to be shot to death
by a drum-Lead court-martial, which in this
country, is merely the dictum of any com
mander. The plan of the negroes is sup
posed to have been to rise on Christmas
Eve, kill the whites and join the insurgents.
At Santiago dc Cuba a landing jf arms at
Mayari is still spoken of, and the newspa
pers for the first time make mention of
Loui Marcano, and say that Generals Jor
dan and Joah Marmol are marching upon
Gibara. It will be remembered that Loui
Marcano was reported by the Spaniards to
have been assassinated by his own men ;
but the story was generally disbelieved. A
detachment of Catalan volunteers has been
completely annihilated by Bembekc upon
the line of the Puerto Principe Rail
way. The frigate Lealtad is soon to sail
for New York. Look out for the Dons, for
they rave and rage as the insurrection grows
stronger and hastens their final withdrawal
from this neighborhood.
~An official dispatch has been received from
General Cavada, dated the 15th November,
near Trinidad.
We have reliable information from the
Trinidad District that the Spaniards were
repulsed with heavy loss in u formidable at
tack made on the rebel position atMacazus,
and sufcscqently a heavy column of troops
was routed at Aquada del Santo, in the im
mediate vicinity of the city of Trinidad, and
pursued by a portion of the patriot forces
up to the very suburbs of the city. These
attacks took place on the 11th and 13th of
November.— N. I'. Wcchhi Times.
THE SPANISH tit'NJBOATS
The lhropnxed Warvoiih Spain Ended in a
Peaceable Manner—The Flotilla Released
NEW YORK, Dec. 10. —In the United
States District Court to-day, before Judge
Blatchford, Mr. Stoughton, on behalf of
Mr. Delamater, made a formal application
for the discharge of the Spanish gunboats,
on the ground that a state of war between
Spain and Peru no longer existed.
United States District Attorney I'ierrc
pont said that the libels bad been filed upon
information received by the Secretary of
State from the Peruvian Minister that the
boats were to be used against Peru; he bad
received instructions from Washington, ac
companied by copies of the correspondence
which had passed between the Spanish
Minister, the Peruvian Minister and the
Secretary of State within the past few days,
which set forth in a satisfactory manner
that a state of war no longer existed between
Spain and Peru;the cause for the detention
of the boats having ceased to exist, the
Government did not feel disposed to press
the matter.
Mr. Stonghton asked if the District At
torney would consent that the libels bo dis
missed, in order to end the litigation at
once.
The District Attorney declined to consent
to anything. He had no objection to the
discharge of the boats; but he thought that
the form of the discharge rested with the
court.
The court did not feel at liberty to grant
the motion before the return day of the
process, which was not until the 14th inst.
The District Attorney said that he had
already stated the facts to the court as he
would state them on the return day; the
Government could not proceed to prosecute
the libels; the cause for their existence
having ceased, no evidence could be offered
to sustain them; he declined to enter into
any consent, but would be satisfied with
anv order which the court might make.
The court then dictated a very elaborate
order discharging the boats, on the ground
that there was no objection on the part of
the District Attorney.
Terrible Murder in Ecrauton.
SCTRANTON, Pa., Dec. 11.—Last evening,
about 8 o'clock, this community was startled
by the murder of a man named Hugh Car
niichael, who. with his wife and four
children, resided on Wyoming avenue. The
perpetrator of the deed is a brother in-law
of the murdered man, named William
Crawford. The quarrel which led to the
murder was the result of a dispute about a
board bill, Crawford stabbed Oarmiehael in
the neck, killing him almost instantly.
An interview with the murderer last even
ing, after his arrest, elicited the following
statements, which arc substantially all the
facts:
"My name is William Crawford. T am 41
years of age. Been in this countiy since
1844. Lived most of the time in Burlington,
N.J. Have lieen in the army. Belonged to
the 4th New Jersey Volunteers, t formerly
boarded with my brother in-law. Car
miehael. I left there about a month ago,
because he abused bis wife atfd family. 1
could not stand it. Tnere was an unsettled
board bill against me. He claimed S6B. I
had taken a good many things into the
family for its support; I think to the amount
of $54. I went there last niglit to see my
sister and her sick child; was engaged in
taking from a frame a memorial in relation
to niv service in the army, received from
the Governor of New Jersey. I had my
knife out to remove the leeks, when Car
miehael came in and asked me to pay my
board bill, and wanted me to give him an
order for the amount. I told him I would
pay when wc had a settlement. He then
pointed to the door and ordered me out. I
went, and he followed mo and kicked me.
When 1 reached the gate I turned upon
him and struck hiin. ! did not tliink of
killing bim; did not know whether the knife
was in my hand or not; did not think about
it. They removed him into the house, and
I followed. 1 had no idea I had killed him.
I am sorry it happened* It is a terrilple
affair. 1 am a temperance man, ana a
member of the Temple of Honor."
The prisoner during this recital exhibited
considerable emotion. From all appear
ances it is evident the murder was nt
premeditated.
Raising of ail Old War Ship.
The hull of the British frigate Augusta,
which was captured by the Continental
forces, set on fire and sunk on the 24th _>f
| October, 1779, between Hog Island and the
Jersey shore, in Delaware Bay, has lately
been raised and a number of relies tken
from tlic bulk. Submarine workers were
employed, chains were passed beneath the
old frame, and attached to canal boats on
either side. Tbe latter were partially filled
with water, the cables passing under the
hull of the wreck were tighhtcned. and the
water pumped out of the boats. The latter
becoming buoyant rose up, and with tlem
the remains of the Augusta, which wore
finally towed to Gloucbester. Among the
articles taken from the hulk are three ♦ld
fashioned guns, a number of skulls, rem
nants of the ill fated British; sixty tons of
shot, used in the smooth here cannon of the
time; a great quantity of Kestlidge ballast,
consisting of blocks ol cast irou, and a large
number of relics, which will be highly priz
ed. Among these were a silver spear,
marked "H. W.. 1748, a fat old bull's eye
watch, with its works eaten up by rust, a
number of guineas with a raised profile of
George 111., and some silver coin dated
1760. The frame of the Augusta is of Irish
oak, and the wood is sound and proof
against decomposition.
This vessel was one of the fleet, the Age
the Rotinick and the Mestim being her con
serts, that attempted tbe bombardment of
Philadelphia in 1779.— Exchange.
Sad Drowning Case In Chester—Two
Young I'eople Break Through the
Ice—They Die in Each Other's Arms.
CHESTER, DEC. 13. On Saturday af
ternoon last the-ity of Chester was thrown
into a condition of sad but intense excite
ment by the sudden and unexpected taking
away of two niueh-loved ami highly respec
ted young people, well known residents of
this city, named respectively Miss Mattie
Irwin and Herman Cocheran. Within the
cemetery in this neighborhood is a small
lake, in winter used as a skating park. Miss
Irwin and Mr. Cocheran proceeded to the
lake accompanied by a little girl, and glided
out upon the ice. Just as the young couple
had reached the deepest portion ol the lake,
the ice broke beneath them, and both were
precipitated into the water. Before aid
could be brought to their assistance they
had disappeared beneath the ice. Kvery
effort was made by those who had been at
tracted to the spot to save them, but owing
to the rotten condition of the ice, and the
want of ropes or other material, it was
nearly an hour before the bodies were
recovered from the water. When found
they were tightly locked in each other's
arms. The affair has cast a gloom over the
entire city.— Jlarriubnrg Patriot.
EROM NEW YOKH.
NEW YORK, Dec. 12.—1t is rumored
that a Vigilance Committee has been or
ganized iu this city, strong in numbers, and
entitled "Law and Order Regulators." The
object is said to be the execution of sum-,
tnary justice on the roughs, who escape
punishment through political influence, and
also that some of the local authorities, in
cluding certain judges, are under the notice
of the "Regulators."
A large quantity of arms were shipped
yesterday from the Fenian headquarters in
this city. Destination unknown.
A large crowd was attracted to the Dela
ware Iron Works, yesterday, by the report
that some of the Spanish gunboats were
about to leave. They are not yet quite
ready, but the work is progressing with
great rapiditv. Eighteen of tbevesscls will
proceed to Cuba in a short time. Scnor
Roberts, the Spanish Minister, arrived here
from Washington, yesterday and the gun
boats were informally turned over to him by
the Government authorities. They will be
cleared for Cuba on Tuesday.
OPIUM SMUGGLING. — The San Francisco
Bulletin says: "United States Appraiser
Bridge has discovered, to-day one of the
most ingenious methods of opium smuggling
yet revealed, at this post. A lot of right
bales of what appeared to be a dried medi
cinal root, received on the steamer America,
was found to conceal a large quantity of
opium, disguised by the inspissated extract
being poured upon tbe roots, where it took
on the red, dusty color and appearance of
the latter, and seemed to be a part of a
general mass, somewhat softened, and show
ing when broken, or pulled apart, a similar
fracture. The whole lot was consigned to
Tuck Kee. who will lose considerably by this
attempt to 'play roots' on Uncle Sam."
The Texas Election.
NEW ORLEANS, Dec.—ll.—A dispatch
from Texas states that returns of the election
in that State from sixty one counties give
Davis, Republican candidate for Goveraer,
9,097 majority. Twenty out of the sixty
one counties gave majorities for tbe Hatnil
ton ticket.
GALVESTON, DEC. 12'.—Returns receive!
from 13 additional counties all give majori
ties forllamilton, aggregating 1,970, leaving
Davis a majority, a< far as heard from, of
7,107. Flanigan, Radical, is elected Lieu
tenant Governor. A large majority of the
Legislature are Radicals.
REDUCTION OF INTEREST.— The reduc
tion of the rat* of interest on a national
debt is not a novelty. In 1822 the state of
the English money market induced the then
minister of finance to reduce tbe interest on
one hundred and fifty-six million pounds of
the British national debt from five to four
per cent. The holders of less than a fiftieth
part of the whole sum objected. The sav
ing to the public was one million two hun
dred and thirty thousand pounds a year.
This process having thus succeeded, it was
further proposed, in 1823, to reduce the
four per cent, interest on seventy five mil
lion pounds to three and a half per cent,
per annum. In the year 1834 the fonr per
cent, interest on the one hundred and fifty
six million pounds first mentioned above was
reduced to three and a half per cent., which
saved over six hundred thousand pounds a
year more. And in 1843 the whole of the
funds which bore an interest of three and a
half per cent., (two hundred and fifty mil

THE Boston Advertiser repoits that at
Mchiasport, Mo., in the harbor opposite
the wharves, there is frequently an uphcc
val. by some power altogether unknown, of
vast quantities of water, mud and stones, to
the distance of many feet, and with a furious
rushing noise. This phenomenon has oc
curred quite a number of timesduiing the
summer, and one as late as a mouth ago.
THE original of the expressions, "a wheel
within a wheel," and "grind the faces of
tho poor," are in the Scriptures. The
tenll) verse of the tenth chapter of Ezekiel
TOads as follows: "And as for their ap
pearances they four had one likeness, as if
awheel had been in the midst of u wheel,"
ad in Isaiah iii., 14, we read, "What mean
ye that ye beat my people to pieces and
grind the faces of the poor?"
THE building of theComiuercial Exchange
Association, in Philadelphia, erected on the
site of the old Penn Mansion, was destroy
ed by fire on the 7th ins'., from the fall of
a large chandelier, and the escape and igni

building at the tfnie the fire began narrowly

from a secoud story window.
Dr. GEO. W. STONE, of Warren Centre,
l'enn., writes to the Scientific American
favoring the idea that the Onondaga fossil
is, indeed, a giant. He says: "As plaster
or gypsum is common in that region, petri
factions in that locality would, of course,
partake of the nature of gypsum. I have
never seen the stone giant above referred
(0, but it would take more than I have yet
seen to convince me that it is not a fossil
man."
IN tho Alabama Legislature on Tuesday
it became necessary to elect a President of
the Senate pro tern. The only negro in the
Senate numed Royal, and of course a radi
cal, courteously Dominated the only white
democrat, whose narno was Worthy. Wor
thy declined the nomination and voted for
his dark eotnplexioned friend, Royal. This
was certainly a Royal and Worthy c >inpro
mi-e as well as a very interesting affair iu
the Alabama of to-day.
Mr. JOSEPH M. KALLMANN, a Glasgow
engineer, has invented an serial steam ma
chine, which has been experimented with
very successfully. It moves with wings,
and is intended to rise into the air after a
short race on terra fir ma, drawing behind it
the tank carriage; it is to be of 120 horse
bower, and is to weigh 8,000 pounds com
plete. The tender is to carry ten hoars'
supply of water; and with this tender and
three cars the machine is intended to make
fifty-.-ix miles per hour.
ON the New Jersey Railroad a conductor
put a passenger off the train for the want
of twenty-five cents to pay his fare; and now
the company pays to the mams widow—
killed by that expulsion—five thousand
dollars. No doubt the conductor's severity
was forced by the regulations of the com
pany. There is probably some rule by
which in such cases the passenger's fare, if
he were allowed to remain iu the cars,
would be deducted front the conductor's pay.
The company now finds how much that sort
of severe economy costs.
MAKING PEGS.—A pegging factory at
Wilton, Missouri, is doing a lartre business,
leaking the ribbon machine pegs. It is a
great curiosity to see the manufacture. A
white birch log. six feet long is put into a
lathe, and ten ktiive- take off ribbons as the
log rapidly revolves, just as one would un
roll a ribbon. A few inom. Nts suffice to cut
a log into ribbons. Each ribbon is then run
through two revolving knives, which reduce
one side of tbe ribbon to a sharp edge. The
ribbons are wound on a reel, aud are then
ready for use, after being dried.
ScRAN TON, De. 10. —List evening,
about du.-k, a sad accident occurred to
three children of Mathias Noll, residing on
Washington avenue, who were playing in
the cinders dumped from the rolling mill.
By some means the little ones got into the
burning cinders, and before the arrival of
assistance one of them was burned to death,
and the other two were badly burned about
the feel aud legs. At every step of the
children in trying to extricate themselves,
their little feet sank ahnost to the knees in
• he burning embers.
MR. IIILL, of New Jersey, has introdu
ced a bill in Congress for the abolition of
the franking privilege. The cost of the
franking swiudle is §5,000,000 per annum,
and it will be augmented annually until it
destroys the life of the postal service, ft is
one ofthe most gigantic abuses in the coun
try, and may be termed with perfect propri
ety a huge swindle. Congress can be occu
pied with no question of more importance
to the interest of the public than this, and
we hope Mr. Hill will earnestly urge his bill
at every opportunity, and bring the mcm
beis to the record, that the country may see
who are in favor of perpetuating this mon
strous national swindle.
A SAD LETTER. —One of the saddest let
ters is that written by the mother of Her
bert Field to Vanderpool, his supposed
murderer, at Manistee, Michigan. After
accusing and upbraiding him in the most
agonized manner, she asks: 4 "l)id Herbert
speak my name, 'mother.'after you struck j
him the first blow? Hid he live many
minutes? Was he alive when you threw
him into tho water?" The effect of these
graphic questions upon the murderer's mind
may only be emagined. But further the
desolate mother says. "Don't you dare to
ever put ou one of bis shirts you stole, or
use one of his hem-stitchcd handkerchiefs,
or anything that belongs to him."
ORIGIN OF THE OPERA.— The opera
originated in Italy. Thence it found its
way all over Europe, being first exclusively
performed for the amusement of royal
courts. Cardinal Marsaran was its patron
aud introduced it into France, and Handel
first put it on the English stage. It is in
oratorio, however, that Handel's fame will
l>c handed down through the generations.
Christopher Gluek, a Bohemian, born in
1714, is to be credited with having brought
opera to perfection. In 1702 he produced
"Orpheo" at Vieona, and "Aloeate" in
1770 —both his own creations. He estab
lished Freneh opera in Paris, while Handel
did the same thing in England. Pieini was
(Buck's great opponent., and stoutly upheld
Italian opera against (Buck's French pro
ductions. The works of Pieini are forgottcu,
but those of Gluck still live.
TSIE recent examination and repair of the
tomb of King Henry VII. at Westminister
Abbey, has led to the discovery that the
oxidation of iron in buildings, even though
the metal be covered by masonry, is in
creased by the employment of copper bolts
to secure the plates in position. The slow
formation of oxide in thisca.sc had acted as
an irresistable wedge, riving the fabric
asunder, and threatening the entire over
throw of this noble monument. The dan
gerous metal has now been replaced by
piates of copper; and the tomb has been re
stored to its original beauty, but the lesson
as to the conduct of iron when included in
masonry or in mortar, even under circum
stances presumably most favorable to the
exclusion of air, is not one of which any
prudent architect, or engineer will lose
sight
IT has recently been discovered that the
springs of chronometers and watches, which
arc constructed of steel, are frequently mag
netic. Steel is at all times liable to become
magnetized from causes beyond man's con
trol. Watch makers are advised to test
their springs as to magnetism by placing
them near to a very small and truly-balanced
mariner's compass. If the spring exhibits
in none of its circumference any tendency to
move to one pole of the compass more than
the other, it may be considered free from
.magnetic influence; on the other hand, ifthe
North pole moves to one part and the South
pole to the other, the spring is decidedly
useless; for in whatever position the time
keeper may be placed with such a spring, it
vrill be affected by the earth 1 s magnetism.
The National Finances.
WASHINGTON, DOC. 12.—The Treasury
Department held on Saturday noon, SIOB,-
065,862 in coin, ofwhich $37,083,840 were
coin deposits, leaving a coin balance, belong
ing to the Government of $70,082, 022.
There was also a balance of $13,066,833.
This shows a heavy gain since the first, not
withstanding the light internal revenue re
ceipts and the largo purchases ol bonds.
THE Chicago Tribune announces the dis
covery of the bones of a tnaetoden, or some
other hueh creature, at the town of Milton,
Dupage County, 111. The bones were found
by a Mr. Horace Jones when digging for a
well. lie was assisted by his neighbors in
excavating after the discovery of the first
huge portion of the fossil. Among the re
mains are the bones of the fore leg; which,
when joined togeiher at the evident june
tions. measure 10 feet iu length. The
shoulder bone or blade, a solid picoe of bone,
measures 10 inches by 12 in its superficial
dimensions. Four ribs were found, all of
wliicb were more or less decayed at the ends.
One measures 4 feet, and another 4 fett 3
inches in length. A number of huge bones,
believed to be_ sections of the spine near its
connection with the head, contain cavities
large enough to admit a man's hand & artn.
Smaller bones were picked up, some of
them supposed to be the bones of the fee'.
These detached joints were the rizis of a
man's fist
VAL.CE OF ALASKA. —Gen. Thomas has
been to Alaska, and what does he find that
we have for our seven millions and more of
sterling coin? Ice and snow, of course, and
a few abandoned cou! mines, the care of a
few hundreds or thousands of degraded
Aleut and Kolosbe Indiana, most of whom
"seem to have no control over their passion
for strong drink," ai d several millions of
seals which, to be vro'th anything, must be
protected by a garrison of from two to three
hundred men with ar. venue steamer at a
cost that will probably far exceed all the
revenue that will he derived from them.
As to ever settling the countiy. GtD.
Thomas, looking at it with the business eye
of a soldier, thinks that to be entirely out
of the question—for the present, at least.
The well stocked gardens* and tropical ver
dure of which we have heard so much
dwindle into a few radishes, potatoes and
lettuce, with barley, oats and wheat that
will not ripen. Perhaps some one would
like to take the elephant off our bands—we
might be induced to sell.
THE Pall Mall Gazette of Nov. 23 states
that an insurrection against the Turkish
Government, produced ostensibly by similar
causes to those which gave rise to the Dal
matian outbreak, his taken place among
the Arabs of Mesopotamia. Turkey is now
reorganizing her army on the Kuropean
model, and the Arabs refuse to submit to
the conscription, which has been ordered in
the Mahometap districts that have been
hitherto exempted from compulsory military
service. Some slight disturbances were
caused by this order in Albania and Ana
tona a few months ago; but the Arab insur
rection seems to be a much more serious
matter judging by the strength of the troops
which have been sent to subdue it. Accor
ding to the last jiccounts, the Arabs have
not only beaten and driven away the recruit
ing sergeants, hat have addressed a formal
declaration to the Governor of Bagdad, in
forming him that they are determined en
tirely to liberate themselves from the Tur
kish rule. Several battles have taken place
between the troops and the insurgents, but
the fatter still hold their ground, and are, it
is said, threatening Bagdad.
ALEXANDRA, Princess of Wales, has un
fortunately contracted a limp from rheu
matism; and now, as we hear, the liege
ladies of England have taken to limping too,
and "halt!" is the latest command given by
fashion. That the "Alexandra limp" will
find its way hither ere long is a thing to be
expected, and, iudeed, it is stated to have
already made its appearance on the fash
ionable promenades of New York. The de
sired limp is obtained simply by wearing
shoes with heels of unequal bight, and the
deformity thus produced is no greater than
that which characterizes the "Grecian
bend." The fashion, of course, will lead to
a modification of most of our present dances
and the invention of new ones. Lopsided
waltzes will have to be devised, and in doing
the "German" crutches will probably corne
to be the proper thing. As the skating
season is at hand, it would be a neat idea j
to carry out the "Alexandra limp" on joe.
We have had ever so many good things "on
ice" already, and why not the limp?" The j
girls of the period are capable of acting on j
any of these suggestions, and they should
by all means begin to have their balmorals
altered at once, if not their morals.
IN April, ]Bf>7, a family consisting of a
man, bis wife, and their -even daughters,
removed from Ohio to the Big Woods Farm,
about 60 miles from St. Paul in Minnesota;
the father snd mother being invalids. All
the work of the farm, the clearing, and
grubbing the land, the fencing, sowing,
planting, cultivating, harvesting, taking
care of the stock, and all other work, ex
cepting splitting the rails, and breaking an!
plowing the cleared land was performed by
the seven sisters. Their efforts have met
with untooked for success, showing what
gentle, modest women can accomplish when
impelled by filial affection and a sense of
duty. Of their crop of last year, besides
what was consumed in the fanny, they sold
900 bushels of potatoes 500 bushels of corn,
200 bushels of wheat, 250 bushels of turnips,
200 bushels of beets, 1,100 beads of cabbage,
i and over §2OO worth of garden stuff. The
j potatoes they sold for 50 cents per bushel.
In the course of a conversation on the
! management, of this model farm, the mother,
a line-looking old lady, remarked : "The
i girls are not proud of the hard work they
1 have had to do to got the farm started, but
j they are not ashamed of it. We were too
poor to get together and live in a town. We
1 could not make a living there, hut here we
have become comfortable and independent.
We have tried to give the girls a good
education. They all read and write, and
find a little lime to read books and papers."
