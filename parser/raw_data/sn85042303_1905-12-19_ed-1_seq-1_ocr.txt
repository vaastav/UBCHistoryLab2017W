COMANCHE INDIANS PLAN A
CHRISTMAS CELEBRATION.
They Have Called a Preacher for
Their Chucrh and Expect His
Arrival In Time to Observe
the Christmas Feast.
Lawton, O. T., Dec. 18. It Is said
that the Comanche Indians aro for
tho first time In their history pre
paring for a celebration of Christina.
What this prepaiatlon Is cannot yet
he dotermlned, yet It Is believed to
Ijo some sort of festivity in connec
tion with the reception of a pastor
of the new Cntnnnclfe church on the
Indian school hind north of this city.
Tho Indlnng havo called a preacher
and ho is expected to arrive by
Christmas.
Tho only holldny tho Comnnchos
havo ovor Iflnrncd to colebrato la tho
Fourth of July. Thoy wcro taught
this thirty years ago by tho soldiers
nt Fort Sill, who came out on their
rosorvntion on the day of American
Independence am' ran horao races
with tho Indiana and Indulged In oth
er holiday sports. Tho Indians learn
ed tho slgnlflcnnco of tho celebration
nnd every year mako preparation for
appropriate exefcisos.
Tho Comancho has learned to rev
oronco tho Amoilcan flag and ho
would fight for it If It becamo neces
sary. He is learning that tho true
liimrH' la nnf nf nti unrestrained va
riety that is meaningless nnd produc

is this reverence crudo tltough it
mfiviA tin nt tho American Hag that
is making him mnro nearly a citizen,
nnd the United Stntes soiuiers may
share tho glory of having begun the
good work .
Another fact Is noticeable" in the
progress being mndo by tho Com
anches, and that is thoy spend less
money foolishly than heretofore,
wj.nn t .iwt.ri wna now and every fan
cy artlclo on display in its show win
dows was novel to tno roil man, men
lio purchased without regard to ne-

something that v.as attractive to tho
cyo. Indians now aro buying moro
meat nnd broad und clothes and less
fancy things and liquor. They fight
less, stay at homo moro and scorn to

higher plnno of citizenship.
