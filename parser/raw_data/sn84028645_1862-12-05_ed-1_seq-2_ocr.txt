Purposes of the War. The Radical View of the President's
Purposes of the War. The Radical View of the President's Message.
Oinui le the treat erpsueDt of the princl
plei tad measures of the sdvance guard of the
R.m.MliMn a Abolition OMtT. Speaking Ol
that wi of the President's meeMge whioh re-
., letae to slavery, Gemlit says la the Tribuni
of the 31 bet.: "Essentially, the President aeea
and Moclalms that slavery has become the im
placable foe of the American Union, and that
the Blare Power must die in oraer mat tne no-
ttrbllo mar life."
The Slave Power" slavery moetdie muet
he ebolIahed-ennibUeied'. Tula Is the Aboil
tlon decree -the great end for which, on radloal
DtlndDlaa. the war la to be prosecuted. They
may deny it and say they do not want an Aboli
tion war; that It ie treason to obargetnem wits
such a desiini bat what else does Gniui
mean when he say s the President "can only sere
the Union by ftntUllng 1U arch enemy" that
U alaven. Accordini to Guulbt and the raa-
. ieele, throttle or destroy slavery, and the work
Is done. Thedestroottonof slavery la the g'eet,
the practioable and Immediate object in the
radical mind to be attained by the war.
Bat Ouiur, like other Republicans of the
same stamp, talks of "saving the Union." Sav
ing the Union 1 What Union 1 Not the Union
WajMitfOTOW and the fathers made. Not that
at all That, according to the Abolitionists, is
deed and gone past saving. They declare In
effect that the rebellion has triumphed and de
stroyed the old Union, and now they want to
.f"h1estroy slavery, end then the work of desiruo
. t wlllbe complete all round.
bkclct says, in the paper quoted from
' aL jve, that President Lmcolw would gladly
Uave restored the Union ae it was; but that was
vot possible- So here the radicals have set
down the stake us the point of departure for
them, namely that a restoration of the Union
has become absolutely impossible. Searing
this in mind, we shall know how to estimate all
the Republican or Abolition talk about saving
the Union and a war for toe Union. They
don't mean the Union as it was. This they
hare themselves asserted over and over again
Therefore, a there never was but the one Union
la this country, they don't mean (At Union at
ell, bnt some humbng or hoc as pocas of their
own contrivance.
On the main point the destruction of slavery
and the Impossibility of saving the Union
Gimir says he heartily agrees with the Presi
dent; bnt he differs with him on the subject of
gradual emancipation and negro exportation.
Ouii.it Is for Immediate total emancipation
end for keeping all ths niggers in the country.
"Bat so long as the great sod" the destruc
tion of slavery and of the Union "is kept
steadily in view," Guelit and the radloals
"can waive all Incidentals." Though the
President in hit message does not come fully4
p to their stand-point, yet as gradual emend-
pation, oompensatiaa for slaves, and negro ex
porta tlon are bnt tubs thrown to amuse the
whale meaning, of course. Conservative Un
lonlam GitaxiT advisee bis radloal brethren;
In tha nam lima, to ha "natlant and work."
The President's Compromise.
The President has fuUy imbibed the radical
, Idea that this -war Is a war solely about slavery,
sad that to end the war ilavery must be abolish
ed. Be, therefore, In his message, proposes a
compromise between radicalism and slavery.
He suggests amendmenti to the Constitution,
whioh will require the assent of two-thirds of
both branches of Congress, and of ail the free
States end seven of the slave States. This
plan. shows that the President, instead of rising
"high with the occasion," sinks Infinitely
What the country needs in this fearful crisis
Is something practicable, Immediate and de
eislve in Its operation. While Congress is dis
cussing the President's amendments, the wtr
will go oni the waste of life, the expenditure
of mosey, end the destruction of property will
eostlsos. It Is not at ell probable that the
President's propositions will be finally noted
tpoa la Congress before January 1st. ; Indeed,
the President himself doee not seem to antici
pate that they will be, for he says that nsitbrr
the war nor proceedings under the proolame
tlo of September 22, will be stayed because
of the recommendation of Us compromise
plan.
So the war will be prose on ted while his eon
etltuUonai amendments are being discussed In
Congress. Even should they obtain the tcqui
site two-thirds majority la Congress, so mortal
enppoees that three-fourths of the States will
adopt them 'pilor to the first day of January
Then, if the President keeps his word, sn edict
win be Issued; in pursuanoe of his emancipation
proclamation, declaring eS the slaves without
eaoeptioa la certain States and parts of States
forever free And this act of total and Imme
diate emancipation is to be earrled Into effect

Mr. Cox offered the following preamble and
resolution: ' .......
Whereas many citisres of the (Jolted States

prisoned In the military prisons and camps of
the United States, without any public charge
having been preferred against them, and with
out any opportunity being allowed them to
learn or disprove the charges mads or alleged
to be made against them; and whereas such
arrest have been made In States where there
was no Insurrection, or rebe lion, or pretense
thereof, or eny other obstruction to the author
ity ol the Uovernment: and wbereaB ti is ine
saored right of every citixen that bo shall not

Retolrnd, Ttiat the House of Representatives

Mr. Lovejoy moved to lay the motion on tbe
table. Carried by 74 agaiost eu,
We desire to place these resolutions on rec
ord, as evidence forever of the utter tyranny
which has been sanctioned by the dominant (ar
ty. In voting down Mr. Cox's resolution, they
condemn every principle of constitutional lib
erty asserted in En-land for hundreds of years,
and repeatedly re asserted In tbe Bill of Rights
of every constitution In America. These prin
ciples of civil liberty, so salutary to pnblio safe
iy, were applied by Republicans when their par
ty. was "young and pure," to the alleged wrongs
of Kacsas. Oa the 18lh of Jane, 1856, at tbe
National Republican Conveatloa la Philadel
phia, a protect was entered egalnet tbe usurpa
tion of officials "sustained by the military pow
er of the Government," to enforce end make
tyrannical and nnconatitutlonsl laws; and ths
right of the people to be secure in tbelr per
sons, houses, pipers and effecta against unrea
sonable seisores was promulged, as if It were
something novel then. . At the same time, it
was charged that the people of Kansas were
"deprived of life, liberty and property, without
du prtctn cf Ua,
What more doee this resolution of Mr. Cox
allege? If its allegations be not true, why re
fuse inquiry into the facts as called for by Gov
RicBauDsoiTs resolution f We are pained to see
the names of Messrs. HoaToaand Hamisoh vot
ing to crush out such principles of publlo liberty
and all inquiry Into them. We expected better
things from them. Bat with Bimohsji, Colfax,
Lovijot, and the rest, sueh votes sre in ever
lasting harmony with their natures. When
suoh ststeamsa as Judge Thomas of Mass,
Gov. Csirrainin, Gbamou of Michigan, Shit-
nxLBof Rbode Island, Wicxurvi of Kentucky,
and others, vote to condemn such sets, and when
such votes represent as they do the now dom
inant sentiment of the nation, we may hope for
better days-

Important to Invalid Discharged
Soldiers and Seamen.
PENSIONSâ€”TO WHOM AND UNDER WHAT CIRCUMSTANCES
GRANTED.
For the benefit of the now very large and in
creasing number of invalid (tick or woacded)
discharged soldiers or seameu, we publish a
synopsis of the law relating to Fensiots, as con
tained in the act of Congress jif July 14tb,
1862:
BP
By this set it is provided that the following
persons shall be entitled to receive pensions,
under (be prescribed regulations governing
tbem:
I. Invalids disabled since March 4, 1861, In
the milltiry or naval service of the United
States in the line of duty.
II. Widows ot officers, soldiers or seamen
dying of wounds received, or of disease con
tracted, in tbe military or naval service, as
abovo.
III. Children, nnder sixteen yeais of age,
of such deceased persons, if there is no widow
surviving, or from tbe time of tbe widow's re
marriage. IV. Mothers (who have no husband living)
of officers, soldier or seamen, deceased as
aforesaid, provided the latter have left neither
widow or children under sixteen years of age;
and provided, also, that tbe mother was depen
dent wholly or to part upon the deceased for
support. . . v
V. Sisters, under sixteen years of age, of
snon deceased persons, dependent on toe latter
wholly or In pari for support, provided there are
no rightful claimants ot either of the three last
preeedlns classes.
The ratee of pension are distinctly set forth
la the act, end are according tj the elasses or
grades ranging rrom eight ) to thirty (30) dol
Jars per month. -
Unit one pension in any case Is allowed to
one person or the relatives thereof.
When more than one minor child or orphan
sister becomes entitled to pension it must be
divided equally between them. . .
The pension, under taia law, will commence
from the data of the pensioner's discharge, if
applied for within one year thereafter. Other
wise the pension will commence from tbe
date ef the application pensions to widows
and minors from the date of the death of the
person upon whose service the calm is based.
The Identity ol tbe claimants must be es
tablished in accordance with the provisions of
the act.
If possible, the certificate of the Captain or
some other commissioned officer nnder whom he
served, should be produced, stating time and
place of the applicant's having been wounded
or disabled, etc.
II for any reason it be impracticable to ob
taia such certificate, it must be, stated by ap
plicant under oath, and the ' fact substan
tiated by other witnesses of known respectabili
ty, ete. - ." '
A sureeen'e certificate mast show tbe char
acter and degree or tbe claimant's disability,

The same proof of mtrriase and of rela.
UonshiD will be rrauired If the claimant he a

The editor of the GUians' Press, of Zines

for his alleged efforts to cause the suppression
of the first-named paper. He says In his last

We warn him, that if he succeeds in his de
sign of inaugurating a mob Li our city, against
Democrats, or against Democratic papers, his
neck will be wrung off in tbe twinkling of ao

put up with all manner of Insults; they will
continue to be law-abiding, peaceable men; but,
if Sbryook attempts to destroy their property,
tbey will defend themselveeeven to retaliation;
therefore, we tell Mr. Sbryock, In plain lang

Mr. Cox's Resolution.
The Honse of Representatives has mads a
bad beginning oi Its second session, In tabling
tbe reaolution of Mr. Cox. It is evident that
the salutary change whioh has overtaken public
sentiment bas not yet reached Congress. Tbe
system of arbitrary arreste In loyal States bas
not any defender among the people. More
over, it bas been virtually repudiated by the Ad
ministration itself, and It remained tor tbe re
assembling of Congress to discover backers for
an outrage upon law and constitution, which
has become a hissing and reproaoh throughout
society. This, at least, is the only construc
tion we can put on the vote of the House to
lay the resolution on tbe table. Buffalo Courier.

' ' Kxlraol Itolfl k letter on the Battle Field.
". e ! e ; , e e '
This battle (Antlelam) bas been the most
saognlnar; of the war, and tbe only ope fought
with visible design and npon military princi
ples. The arrangement of our oorps the
overlooking position of ths commanding Gen
eralthe sending into aotlon the right and left
divisions tbe closing up of tbe oeoter, and fi
nal success exolles bewildering admiration,
and oarrles the mind to tbs great fields of Ans
terlits and Wagram, fought by Napoleon. Of
all this have I spoken. .The heart history of
suoh a oonfllot, purohased by the life and blood
of twenty thousand men, must be found in tbe
hospitals. War bas Us glories but it has its
ten thousand demons in these human tortures,
that make the eye balls ache the heart bleed
tbe Hps palsy, and tbe brain reel. The sight
Is at first positively unendurable. Tbe life
blood of some is ell 11 trickling away in silent
oalmness while the dissevered limbs and mi
nlao brain of others give rise to sounds God
grant I may not again witness.
. But ys mothers who here seek a son or
wives a husband or slaters a brother or sons
a father know snd be consoled that even here
the band of meroy ia watohfnl, and batter oare
Is bestowed upon your loved ones than might
at first seem possible. It was In the hospital,
where rested the gallant Hooker, that I learned
the history of those mythical words so often
seen and so little understood, "8. T. 1860
X." Aoylhlng alleviating the sufferings and
saving the Jives of our soldiers, Is a national
blessing. I witnessed some estoniehiog results
from this article.
Il Is well known tbe fleet of burnt gunpow
der and ezeitement is thirst, which added to the
loss of blood In tbe wounded, creates Ibe ne
cessity of a reviving stimulant. Is this par
tloular hospital, the phyeioians were allowing
their patients to drink Plantation Bitters, other
wise called S. T. 1860 X, and although the
wounded are most numerous here this di
vision having opened tbe fight at 5 In the morn'
ing the men were mostly composed, and there
was very little fainting. The arliole acts npon
the stomach acd nerves In amostlncomprchen
slble manner, superior to brandy, and without
subsequent stupefying reaction. It originated
In the West Indies, composed of the oeUbrated
Caiiuaya Bark, Roots, Herb), etc.; all preserv
ed in St Croix Rum the S. T. 1860 X be
ing a eeoret ingredient, not yet revealed to the
public. It is principally recommended for wsnt
ot appetite, disordered llvor, intermittent fe
vers, stomachic difficulties, eto. I understand it
was somewhat known in the Southern States
previous to the war, and it appears an agent of
Jefferson Davis recently applied to tbe proprie
tors for the privilege to make it for hospital
purposes during the war, to whioh they made
the following reply :
Niw Yon, Jan. 16th, 1868.
Mr. ,
Agent of, tie. t
Dear Sir In reply to your communication.
offering us "Fifty thousand dollars for the re-
oipe and right to make toe flantation Bitters
for yonr hospital purposes during the war," we
neg to say, your price is a uoerai one, consid
ering it would cost us nothing to comply, and
that otherwise we osn derive no revenue from
the Southern States; but, sir, our duties to our
Government and our Ideas of consistency
would not allow ua to entertain it, although il
might please us to assusge the sufferings of
your misguiaea followers.
We remain,
Very respoctfully, vour,

These gentlemen give the history of certain
ingredient of their srtlole for over two bund
red years showing that through all changes
of tbs medical profession and its practitioner,
strength, composure snd cheerfulness hsve been
derived from these sources. -Dr. Woods In the
Washington Hospitals Informed me that one
patient waa fast sinking acd craxy, and bad not
slept sn hour for two weeks, until the Planta
tion Bitters came t j his knowledge, when one
dsy's trial gave him a night's rest, and he was
now fast reoovering. I am surprised our Gov
ernment has not equaled Jefferson Davis in en
ergy, and adopted this Invaloible article in all
our hospitals. The weak mldiets cling to it
llks a brother. As a lay member, I can bear
witness it Is "good to take," and affords more
energy and life than anything I ever tried
