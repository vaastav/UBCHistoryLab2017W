NEGOTIATION SUES,
The Cherokee Legislature Takes Action on
the Strip Question.
TAHLEQUAH, Dec 4. Councilman Jack
son, of the Coweescowee district, has in
troduced a bill in the lower branch of the
legislature providing for three delegates
to negotiate with the Cherokee comission
ers. The clause which relates to a consti
tutional prohibition of a sale was left out.
The bill provides that the Cherokee dele
gates shall report to the council before con
cluding any agreement, aud that the
whole matter shall be left to a vote of the
Cherokee people.
The bill passed both houses of the legis
lature today and almoat immediately re
ceived the signature of Chief Mayes, who
named V. P. Boudinot, R. M. Walker and
ex-Chief Bushyhead as members of the
:ommittee. The senate refused to con-
5rm the tht appointment of Bnudiuot and
Walker and Chief Mayes then named W.
A. Dunkin and Ridge Pascal in their
places. It is believed the senate will con
firm their appointment at tomorrow's ses
sion. The bill providing for the committee
places no restriction upon the committee
beyond the instructing them to obtain as
much as possible for the land. It provides
also that the decision reached by them
shall not be binding upon the Cherokee
government until it shall have been rati
fied by a vote of the people at an election
jailed for that puipose. The legislative
action is regarded as very favorable by
the United States commission.
This morninc a joint resolution, intro
duced by Jackson, passed the council
against L. E.Bennett's confirmation by
the United States Semite, as agent of the
five civilized tribes. The resolution ob
jects to Bennett's annual report, which
lays the Cherokees have systemically rob
bed the Shawnees. The resolution inti
mates that Bennett was connected with
the late Creek steal of Oklahoma.
NO TROOPS TO BE USED.
St, Loins, Mo., Nov. 1. A special from
Washington says in regard to the Guthrie
railway troubles:
It seems that there is a good deal of fric
tion at Guthrie, in Oklahoma, between a
railroad company known as the Choctaw
Coal & Railroad company aud the citizens
of that town. Ihe railroad company
claims that it has a right-of-way through
thecenterof the town, and threats have
been made that United States troops
would be used to dispossess the settlers.
Mr" Mansur, of rissouri, in behalf of the
settlers, presented n petition to Secretary
Noble today from citizens of Guthrie
against the ue of troops to aid the rail
road company. Mr. Mansur called the
secretary's attention to the fact that
the right-of-way of the railroad wn. ap
proved February IS, 1&S; that Oklahoma
was proclaimed open by the presi
dent in April. 1S59, under which the town
site was laid out. That ou July 1., lfcS'J,
the managers of the railroad company
tiled with the interior department their
selection for the right of way, and it was
approved.
Stcretary Noble felt iudiunant when the
matters, were called to his attention, anil
insinuated that a fraud was practised on
him, as there was no montion of a town
being located ou the right, of way. Mr.
Noble took the papers with notes of Mr.
Mausur's statement, and promised to lay
them before the president. He intimated
-i onj,l Tl .it troops would not be used to
ponS"s.s xhf suters. It s-esuis that
Monger CL.idwK.iv, ot the raia -ad coni
i my, had .si iti d recently at Guthrie that
he had asMir mew, that troops would be
used to dispossess the settler if they did
not voluntarily retire from the railroad
coinpauy's right of way.
THE FARMERS AND LABORERS.
St. Louis, Mo., Dec. 4. The larmers'
aud Laborers' union., resumed its session
this morning, but in the absence of reports
from standing or special committees the
most of the time was taken up in speech
making. President Macuno of the South
ern Farmers' alliance, made his annual
address. This alliance is now consolidated
with the union. Committees were nu
poiuted on tare and bagging, on constitu
tion and on president's message.
The joint committee of the union and
the northern alliance appointed vesterday
after a long conference last nitrht failed to
agree upon a plau of constitution and this
morning a new committee of live was ap
pointed to tackle the matter.
Mr. Ralph Beaumont, chairman of
the national delegation committeo
of the Knights of Labor at Wash
ington aud one ot the commit
tee to confer with a eomui.ttee
from the Farmers and Laborers union
said this afternoon: '"We have no intea- (
tiou oi endeavoring to cttect a consolida
tion with the Farmers and Laborers
uuion. As 1 understand it, the northern
and southern Farmers' alliances, the
Farmers' Mutual Benefit association and
the Agricultural Wheel have consolidated
and we are to confer with them with a
view to furthering the interests of both
organizations in the way of co-operating,
not consolidation. Wo "shall acreo that
when the farmers put a candidate in the
field for either a legislative, senatorial or
presidential nositiou wo will support that
candidate and they will do the same for
us."
KANSAS AND NEBRASKA 'RATE QUES
TION. Chicago, 111.. Dec. 4. The managers of
the lines in the Interstate Commerce Kail
way association resumed their meeting to
day and again grappled with the question
of rates to Kansas aud Nebraska points.
Thay were unable to make any better
headway than on the preceding da v.
Finally a committee was appointed to con
fer with the roads inost directly interested
with a view to adopting if possible some
compromise plan of adjustment, and this
committee was directed to report t the
adjourned session tomorrow.
WmDOM'S EEPOET.
Similar Eocommendations and Showings
to Those in the President's Message.
Washington, Dec. 4. The report of the
secretary of the treasury shows that the
ordinary revenues of the government from
all sources for the fiscal year ended June
SO, 1689, were $387,050,058. Ordinary ex
penditures, 281,930,015, leaving a surplus
of $105,053,143, of which there was used in
the redemption of notes and fractionhl cur
rency and purchase of bonds for the sink
ing fund the sum of $47,583,313, leaving a
net surplus of 57,470, 129. As compared
with the fiscal year, 1SSS, the receipts for
18S0 have increased S7,7S3,9S4. The ordi
nary expenditures have increased
22,342,053 For the present fiscal
year receipts from the revenue
actual aud estimated are S3S5, 000,000;
the expenditures are 293,000,000; estimated
surplus $92,000 000; estimated amount re
quired tor sinking fund $48,221,117. leav
ing a net surplus of S43!67S,8S3. The reve
nues of the government for the fiscal year
ending June 30, 1SS1, are estimated to be
3S5,000,000; total estimated expenditures,
including sinking fund, f292.271.405, or an
estimated surplus of 92,728,859; estimated
amount required for sinking fund 49,159,
073, leaving a net surplus of 43,509,522.
There was applied to the purchase and
redemption of the debt 90,979,427 as com
pared with 103,220,064 at the close of the
fiscal year 18S8. The cash balance in the
treasury over and above all accrued liabili
ties at the close of 1S89 was 71,484.042
If to this balance there can be added
the estimated suiplus for the current
fiscal year, the amount that may be ap
plied to the purchase of bonds to June 30,
1890, will be 163,484,042. Bonds and other
obligations of the United States have been
puicnased aud redeemed to the extent of
50,404,435, leaving the available cash ou
hand November 1, lfctti, .Ho.itto.rW.
TENSION EXPENDITURE.
The amount expended for pensions for
the year ended June 30. 1889, was 95,021,
719; appropriated and estimated for same
period, 97.75S,700; estimated for year end
ing June 30, 1891, 98,587,252.
A comparison of the expenditures of 1S79
with those of 1889 will show that during
the last ten jears the increase of
pensions has not differed very
widely from the decrease of inter
est on the public debt. Pensions in 1879,
35,121,48.'. Pennons in 1!S9, 95,G24;779.
Interest on public debt 1879, 15,327,949.
Interest on public debt 1SS9, 41.001,484.
No patriotic American has ever complained
of the vast amouuts of interest paid to the
men who loaned their money to preserve
the integrity of the nation. Much less
will they complain of any just and proper
recognition ot the claims of men who, in
tne nation's hour of extreme peril, sacri
ficed their lives to save it.
TUBCnASE OF BONDS.
During the twelve months ending Oc
toherSl. 18s9, there were purchased United
States bonds to the amount of 99,253,952.
In spite of the diminished supply of bonds
for sale in the markets the government has
been able to obtain at constantly decreas
ing prices a sufficient amount of bonds to
meet the requirements of the sinking fund
for the current fiscal year and carry out
the provisions of law respecting the in
vestment ot the surplus revenue.
INDUCING THE SURPLUS.
It appears from the foregoing estimate
that after due provisions shall have
been mads to meet the ordinary
expenditures of the government, there wiil
remain under the operation of existing
laws an annual surplus of about $44,000,
000. An accumulation of mouey in the
treasury beyond the necessities ot the gov
ernment endangers legitimate business,
leads to excessive and wasteful expendi
ture aud to encourage extravagance in pri
vate affairs. To decrease this surplus and
l hereby do away with its attendant evils
the secretary recommends that a portion
of it be used to enlarge our foreign mar
kets and to strengthen our coast defenses.
But after making such provisions a large
annual surplus will still remain tinder ex
isting laws. The only means now open to
the secretary for the- use of this money
is a reduction of the interest
bearing debt of the government, by the
purchnse of bonds To require from him
this measure of responsibility is of doubt
ful wisdom. It is manifestly wrong to
take money lrom the people tor the can
cellation of bonds to the saving of only
ahont - per cent of interest when it is
worth to them perhaps three times as
much in their business It is through a
reduction of custom rates and iuterual
taxes that an unnecessary accumulation
of money iu the treasury should be
avoided.
Reductions in receipts from customs
presents the only other advisable means
for diminishing the revenue. This can be
accomplished: First, by reduction iu rates
of duty upon those articles whicli by rea
son of inconsiderate legislation, or
changes which have occurred in the devel
opment of our industries are found to
be exces-ive: second, 1)3 increase in rates
upou articles which have not been success
fully produced here, because not adequate
ly protected; the obvious effect of which
increase would be to stimulate domestic
pioduction and diminish importations and
revenue. It is nlain that such articles
should either be fairly protected or else
placed on the free list; thiru, by transfer
rins' to the free list articles which, from
c'imatic or other causes, are not, and can
not be successlully produced here, also
articles which under existing circum
stances, we can not economically produce
in sufficient quantities to meet the needs
of our people or to serve the purpose of
comueti'ion with foreign productions, and
articles the production of which is of in
considerable imuortance.
The causes are exceptional under our
tariff in which mo lerato or reasonable re
duction of rates wouul result in a decrease
of the revenue. This, as a general r"le,
would iucrease importations iu ureater
proportion than the xates were reduced
and so increase rather than diminish re
ceipts. This m its turn would largely iu
crease the surplus and correspondingly re
duce the price of labor.
REVISION OF THE TARIFF.
Whatever differences of opiuion are en
tertained as to the best methods of effect
iuc it, it is generally agreed that a revision
of the tariff and custom laws is urgently
needed. In the adjustment of duties on
imports protection to home industry should
be a governing consideration. While there
is a wide divergence of judgment
on the proposition, it can not well be de
nied that it is the settled policy ot this
government that such duties should be so
levied as to result in protection of labor.
One of the fundamental objeda of levying
duties ou imports declared in the "first
tariff act as pas-ed by congress in 1789 was
the encouragement md protection of home
industries. Tne wisdom of this doctrine
lias been demonstrated by the marvellous
development of those industries protected
by the high unties demanded by the gov
ernment incident to civil war. It should,
however, lxi remembered that the prime
object in the imposition of these hih du
ties was the raisiug of revenue, and rates
were adjusted to that end, rather than to
the development and protection of domestic i
industries. It came about, therefore, that
the measure of protection was unequaland
some industries were s;reatly prospered
hile others lancuibed. The tariff act of
lNSl, while intended as a protective
measure, was based on former tariffs and
perpetuated mauy of the inequalities and
defects with which these acts abounded.
It is. therefore, urged that iu revising the
tariff, schedules can be taken to avoid con
flicting provisions and ambieuities, which
have produced the evils mentioned, also
that rates be so adjusted a toaoid the j
inequalities or tne exiting law so hurt
ful " to domestic industries. Further
more, iu the construction of a
tariff law in its broader sene,
reference should also be had to the culti
vation and extension of our trade rela
tions with those countries whose geograph
ical situation and resources are such as to
make intimate commercial intercourse
with them particular! y desirable.
FOREIGN COMMERCE.
The total value of our imports at.d ex
ports of merchandise and specie during
the last fiscal year was $1,613,187,633, an in
crease over the preceding year of S7,473,
843, and was greater than for any year
since 1881. Of this amount there was
nold exported to the amount of 59,952,285;
the imports were $10,284,858. This excess
of exports over imports of gold was mainly
due to the increase of foreign travel on the
part of our people and the consequent for
eign increased demand for foreign ex
change. The total valub of exports
of domestic merchandise was $730,282,609,
an increase of $46,420,505 over the preced
ing year. The imports during the last
fiscal year was tbe-Jargest on the history
of our commerce, amounting to 745,131,
C52, an increase of 21,174,538 over the fiscal
year 1S8S.
MERCHANT MARINE.
It is but a few years since we stood first
among the nations in ship building and
were excelled only by Great Britain in the
amount of our ocean tonnage.
Now so tar as our foreign trade is con
cerned our ship yards are comparatively
silent and our flag has almost disappeared
from the high seas. Once 75 per cent of
tonnaue was carried by our own ships;
now 87 per cent is carried in foreign
bottoms. .Alien capital now levies
UDon the people an annual tribute of
150,000,0i,0 for freight and fares. Our
farmers and mechanics are practically ex
cluded from the markets of the world. An
overwhelming public sentiment demands
that this humiliation and loss should
cease.
The report goes on to state various
amounts paid by foreign nations out of
their treasuries to steamship compauies
for mail contracts and subsidies while the
United States has utterly neclected and
abandoned her great foreign maritime in
terests, even declining to pay fair rates for
services rendered by vessels of the United
States, although congress had appropri
ated money for the purpose.
Fully convinced that American steam
ship builders and owners can not unaided
compete with the governments of Europe:
that without proper aid and encourage
ment from the Uuited States, we
shall fail to retain the small amount of
foreign trade that remains and that the
extension of our foreign trade is dependent
upon the restoration of our merchant
marine, I do no hesitate to recommend
that liberal aud judicious aid aud en
couragement be given for the construction
or steam merchant vessels; that fair and
liberal rates be paid to American steamers
for transportation of mails to loreign
countries.
TRADE WITH AMERICAN NATIONS.
Excluding specie Mexico and estimat
ing from the trade returns of the fiscal
year 1SSS, Mexico imported 43,380,000; of
this amount came from the Uuited States,
19.000,000; Central America fM.SOO.OOO,
from the United States 4,592,080; South
America 304,833,005, fioin the United
States 29.579,227; West Indies 97,544,!520,
from the United States 7,809,102; Brazil
114,S35,G70, from the Uuited Stutes 7,137,
00s; Argentine Kenublic 113,244,801, from
the United States $6,043,553; Chili 02,
077,831, from the Uuited States 2.433,221.
SILVER COINAGE.
The continued coinage of the silver dol
lar at a constantly increasing monthly
quota is a disturbing element in the other
wise excellent financial condition of the
country and a positive hinderauce to any
international agreement looking to a free
coinage of both metals at a fixed ratio.
Since the passage of the act of February
23, 1S34. there have been coined 343.G3S.C01
silver dollars. To coin this amount of
money the purchase of 299,8S9,41G standard
ounces of silver was required at a cost of
520,930,033. On November 1 of the pres
ent year there were iu circulation 60,093,
4S0 sliver dollars, the remainder, 33.539,
521. beinir stored away iu government
vaults, of which 377,319,941 was covered by
outstanding certificates. The price of silver
on M.trch 1, 1878. was 54 15-10 pence, on
June 30, j8S9, 42.499 pence. The lower the
price of silver the greater the quantity
that must be purchased and the larger the
number of silver dollars to be coined to
comply with the act of February 28, 1878.
No proper effort has been spared to put
into circulation the dollars coined under
this law. The stock of these dollais which
can perform any useful function as a cir
culating medium must soon be leached if
it has not been already and the further
coinage and storage of them will
then become a waste of public money
and a burden upon the treasury.
In this country public seutiment
and commercial and industrial necessity
demand the joint use of both silver and
gold as money. With a stock of 343 633,
000 silver dollars sharing equally with our
gold coins the ruuctionof lull 'egai tender
money, aud an annual product from our
mines approximating 60,000,000 (coining
value), it would not bo the wisest policy to
discontinue the use of either metal as
money. Therefore the question is, "how
shall we use both." Various solutions of
this problem have been proposed, among
which may be mentioned the following:
First, an international agreemeut fixing a
ratio between silver and gold, and opening
the mines ot the leading nations of
the world to the free coinage of both met
als at tlio rate so established; second, the
policy of purchasing and coining 4,000,000
worth of silver per mouth; third, increased
coinage and purchase of silver to the max
imum of 4,OJO,000 per month, now au
thorised by law. Since March 1, 187S,
there has been no contraction, but on the
contrary an expansion of our currency, as
appears from tne following statement:
Total increase of circulation of all kinds
has been 713,970,403, total decrease 114,
752,210; net increase 599,224.193. Tha
statement, therefore, that this country is
suffering a paralysis from a severe contrac
tion does not seem to be sound; fourth, free
coinage of standard silver dollars: fifth,
the coinage of silver dollars containing a
dollar's worth of bullion; sixth, issue
certificates to depositors of silver bullion
at the Tate of one dollar for 412,1., grains of
standard sliver.
The secretary recommends the following
measure: Issue treasury notes against
deposits of silver bullion at the market
price of silver when deposited payable ou
demand in such quantities of silver bul
lion as will equal iu value, at the date of
presentation, the number of dollars ex
pressed on the face of the notes at the
market price ot silver (or in gold) at
the option of tha government or in silver
dollars at the option of the holder: repeal
the present features of the present coinasre
law. Special attention is called to this
proposition by the secretary. The advant
ages to Ikj derived from such a measure
are obvious.
The report then treats of the purchase of
silver, deposits of public money, the na
tional bank system, immigration, the
Chinese exclusion act and ends with civil
service laws.
CAPITAL NOTES-
WASHINGTON, Dec. 4 Senator Cockrell
today presented a memorial of the citizens
of Balls and Pike counties, Missouri, pro
testing against the passage of any bill for
the observance of Sunday or any religious
institution or rite, and also against any
amendment to the constitution providing
for religious instruction iu the public
schools. It prays that the government be
kept strictly secular and that church and
suae be entirely separate.
The total collection of internal revenue
for the first four months of the present
fiscal year were 40,753,350, an increase of
4,039,364, as compared with the colletions
duriug the coireponding period last year.
The increne was" principally due to the
increased consumption of spirits, tobacco
aud fermented liquors.
Someone has declared deceit worse than
consumption, and the comparison is a
true one. Many are the "conceited" who
cry down legitimate remedies, and who
delude suffering humanity, whose only
snlvaiion is the immediate use of Dr.
Bull's Cough Syrup.

CHICAGO COlfTROLS.
A Controlling Interest in the Live Stock
Organization.
Chicago, HI., Dec. 4. E. P. Savage, of
Omaha, was made chairman of the second
days' session of the live stock dealers' con
vention. The committeo on constitution
and by-laws for the proposed national or
ganization made their report. The third
section, providing-for the basis of repre
sentation in the exchange, caused a
wrangle which lasted until 12:30, when an
adjournment was taken until 2 o'clock.
Ou the basis proposed Chicago would be
entitled to 34 out of the total of 57 members
of the national exchange. There was a
lively "kick" on this from Kansas City and
Omaha.
When the meeting reconvened the Kan
sas City delegation had dropped its bel
ligerent attitude and was concilliatory.
Section three was again taken up and
finally adopted, the Kansas City delegates,
however, voting no.
J. A. Hake, of Omaha, chairman of the
committee on organization, submitted a
resolution asking to have tne rules and by
laws submitted to the local exchanges for
ratification, to be reported back by Decem
ber 15, and if adopted by all
local exchanges, the same to
take effect January 1, 1890. The
Kansas City delegation opposed the
resolution. The Omaha delegation voted
for the resolution and because of the al
leged treachery. Colonel Peters, of Kansas
City, treated the Omaha delegation to a
strong and rather pointed.
Amendments to the resolution were pre
sented and finally a substitute that the
rules and by-laws be adopted by the ex
changes ratifying them, as submitted by
Delegate ScrugVs of Kansas City. The
substitute had a soothing effect and was
adopted.
Chairman Hake introduced a second
resolution that the first aunual meeting of
tho national exchange be held in
Chicago on the first Thursday
in October, 1890. A committee
was appointed to select officers
for the ensuing year. The committee sub
sequently reported the following and the
selection was unanimously adopted by the
convention: Vice presidents, M. D.
Scrugus, Kansas City; J. A. Hake, Omaha;
E. J. Senshee, St. Louis; J. V. Vincent,
Peoria; A. J. Parson, Sioux City. C. W.
Baker, Chicago, secretary. Levi Dodd,
Chicago, treasurer.
President Thompson appointed the fol
lowing executive: Charles P. Chuds, Kan
sas City; J. B Blanchard, Omaha; W. L.
Cassidy, St. Louis; J. Rosenbaum, Chi
cago; M, V. White, Peoria; Thomas Coro
bin, St. Louis.
The meeting adjourned until tomorrow.
At the conclusion of the session the opin
ion of the Kansas City delegation was that
their exchange would refuse to ratify the
convention's work. The reports are nflo it
that the organization of tho exchange
meant a new live stock trust but it was
emphatically denied by the delegates.
"There are evils enough in the live stock
business," said Mr. Thompson, "and if wo
correct them, which is our only end in
view, we shall accomplish a good thing for
everybody from producer to consumer."

WILL ABIDE BY THE DECISION.
Kansas City, Mo., Dec. 4. Chairman
Downing, of the state board of railway
commissioners, held a meeting today with
the grain elevator men. It was agreed
that the constitutionality of the state grain
inspection law should be referred to the
state supreme court. When the law went
into effect a month ago the elevator men
refused to qualify under it. Mr. Downing
notified them that they were doing busi
ness contrary to law and that he proposed
to take action against them. As a result
today's meeting "was held. Both the rail
way commission aud the elevator men en
gage to abide by the supremo court's de
cision without going through the usual
legal form.

IGOE AND MILES BURIED.
Minneapolis, Miun., Dec. 4. the ruins
of the burned Tribune building were still
smoking today as the two hearses bearing
Operators James F. Icoe and Walter E.
Miles, of the Associated Press, were driven
past, taking the lifeless victims of tho
disaster to their List resting place in the
east side Catholic cemetery. Four fellow
operators fiom the Associated Press, four
from the Western and four from the
North American Telegraph company acted
as pall bearers. High requiem mass was
celebrated at the Holy Rosary church.
Father Brewer preached an impressive
sermon and the two men together in
death as in life were carried to the city of
the dead.
It is now believed that Miles reached tho
fire escape on the night of his death and
seeintr Igoe was not there turned back to
look for him. The delay proved fatal.
Commercial Editor Williams' funeral

A VERMILION COUNTY MAN SAYS IT

"Suppose some one should ask you to tell
him tho best place to go and got eagles," said
a man who claimed to ba from Indiana,
"would you instantly refer him to my be
loved state as the place above all others for ,
him to go? If I was a betting man I wouldn't
be afraid to bet dollars to cents that yon
would no more associate Indiana ia your
mind with eagles than I would connect tho
coast of Labrador with parrots. But bear in
mind after this that if any one should ever
come to you and beg you to point him tho
way to eagles, point him to Indiana, and you
will make no mistake. Point him, especially,
to Vermilion county. Theio are eagles all
over my state, but Vermilion county seems
to bo their favorite retreat, I live in Ver
milion county.
TIIK BALD JloD GOLDEN EAGLES.
"I don't know that outside of Vermilion
county there is an Indiana man who knows
much about eagles, and maybe Vermilion
county folks wouldnrt bo so familiar with
them if it wasn't that Professor John Collett,
the naturalist, lives there, aud Iig talk3 right

when they haven't. What thy thought was

2-year-old male of tho bald eagle family.
The reason a bald ealo is called a bald eajlo
is because of a white crest with vthieh

that crest until he u past 2 years old. The
golden eaglo looks very much like tho bald

"There's a farm in Vermilion county

and it has been thero as long as any one can
remember anything about that part of tho
Etate. The eagles hold a convention thra
every night, and Professor Collett says tnat
