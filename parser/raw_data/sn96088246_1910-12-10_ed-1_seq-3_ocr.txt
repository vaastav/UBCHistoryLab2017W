ATTEMPTED SUICIDE.
Willis K. Urookes, a young
mining engineer who arrived
here recently from Grant county,
took a auantitv of laudanum
about 1:30 o'clock this morning,
it is stated, with suicidal intent
Ho went into the bar room of
the Burns hotel, whero ho took
the dose, and handed iho bar
tender a letter addressed to his
wife, which ho requested be
mailed. Ho also gave the bar
tender his purse. Later he went
to the Windsor, where John War-
low was at the lunch counter,
and sat down on a high stooi
near John and asked for a cup of
black coffee. Brookes suddenly
fell from tho stool and bystand
ers got him on his feet and
walked him on the street, in the
meantime sending for Dr. Grif
fith. The man finally vomited
up the laudanum and Marshal
Haines after walking him for a
long timo took him to his room.
Before going to his room, how
ever, ho secured the letter he
had written and destroyed it
Ho is out of danger this morning.
Very little is known of him
here other than that he is re
ported to bo a good mining engi
neer but had recontly lost his
position and is short of funds.
He admitted to tho marshal that
he intended to end his life and
that it was a cowardly trick.
