SOUTHERN FARMERS IN
COUNCIL.
Gen. Logan's Land Bounty
BiU.
The Farmers' Congress.
Loiisyili.e, Ky., December 5. — The
Farmers' Congress ol the United States
convened to day at the Gault House. Sixty
delegates are present, representing Ken
tucky. Tennessee, South Carolina, Virginia,
Mississippi. Colorado, Indiana, and other
State delegates are expected to arrive to
night. The 1'resident of the Congress, Ma
jor Thos. J. Hudson, of Lamar, Mississippi,
opened the Congress by an address of some
length setting forth the demands and wants
of the agriculturalists, especially urging
the appointment of a Commissioner of Ag
riculture as a member of the President's
cabinet. Such an officer, he said, could
watch our foreign relations in respect to
this interest, which must e\er be guarded,
and he would be enabled to secure for the
farmer's labor better results. There is not
a farmer in all this country who under
stands farming as he should, and how ig
norant must be the cabinet and national
councils who have never studied it. The
prosperity of the country depends on the
progress of agriculture. Such being the
state of affairs, all deliberations of national
iKxlies [should tend toward its elevation.
This can never be secured till the farmers
are brought into a body. Let us therefore
teach the farmers their own interest and
raise a cry that will reach the federal gov
ernment at Washington. We are in sad
need of scientific knowledge in farming,
and such means should be secured as would
put this knowledge into the possession of
the humblest tillers of the soil. Statistics
should be arranged showing the cause and
the prosperity of various products in vari
ous quarters. Thus the farmer would know
what laud was best adapted to the produc
tion of such crops, and would know his
own poverty as compared with the wealth
of his neighbor. These reports should be
made monthly. The good results of such
a system regarding cotton shows to great
advantage.
At the conclusion of the President's ad
dress. committees were appointed lor the
various duties. The Congress will prob
ably be in session three days.
Laud Bounty Bill.
Washington, December 5.— Senator
Logan's bounty laud bill, introduced to-day,
provides that "every person entering the
service of the country during the late war,
either in the army or navy, and properly
discharged therefrom, for any period of
service less than one year be entitled to 80
acres of public land, either for himself or
heirs; for service between one and two
years 120 acres of land ; for service of over
two years 100 acres.
Senator Plumb introduced a bill provid
ing that every non-commissioned officer,
private or other person, discharged from
the army during the war of the rebellion,
within two years from the date of enlist
ment on account of disability incurred in
the line of military duty, shall receive a
warrant r o. 160 acres of land.
Mormon Criticism on the President's
Message.
Salt Lake, December 5.—The Neiat, a
Mormon organ, in a leader says: The
President's message is well hailed by a
hireling clergy with pleasure, and will
receive a certain amount of popular sup
port. It is not shown in what way the
destruction of our local government would
affect the question of polygamy. The
plural marriage of Mormons is uot recog
nized by the Territorial laws, and could
uot, if dissolved by commissions, edicts of
armies, or any other earthly power, affect
the institution. Their ecclesiastic princi
ples are perpetual, eternal, and until the
Mormons become recreant to their faith
with high heaven, those unions will be
recognized by the Almighty being who
established them for the benefit of his peo
ple and the fulness of his glory. The
President's remarks on Utah and polyg
amy did not add force to his message, nor
do credit to his statesmanship. It is "sop"
to bigots and breath to the flame of popu
lar passion. It doubtless will have prac
tical bearing on Congress, but certainly
will create no commotion among the God
fearing people of Utah.
The same journal throws "sop" to the
Democrats, and hopes they will defeat the
measure in the House.
\\ usliingtoii Notes.
Washington, December 5. —The Presi
dent sent a large number ot recess nomi- |
nations to the Senate to-day, among them |
that of Walter (j. Gresham for Postmaster- !
General. j
The deputy commissioner of internal j
revenue says the internal taxes already !
collected for the present fiscal year are at j
the rate of $123,000,000 per annum. He ;
estimates the collections for the entire year j
will amount to $130,000,000. This esti- i
mst£e includes between six and seven mil
liohs to be collected as special taxes in
April and May, but does not include the
increase anticipated front spirits forced out
by law.
Sherman presented to the Senate to-day
a petition f rom J. \\ . Niles, a colored sepa
ratist of Arkansas, setting forth that al
leged unlawful combinations prevent him
and his colored associates from exercising
the right of making entries ol public lands,
charging cruel treatment on the part of the
white citizens of Arkansas, and asking
relief.
The Secretary of the Treasury has trans
mitted to Congress estimates of required
appropriations for the fiscal year ending
June 30,1885. The amount estimated as
required to meet all expenditures of the
government is $283,125,30«», which is
$22,323,282 less than the aggregate appro
priations for the present fiscal year, and
$57,154,857 less than the sum called for in
the estimates submitted last year. The
appropriations for the present fiscal year,
including deficiencies and miscellaneous
items, is $385.445,587. The estimates upon
which tlmse appropriations were based
called for $402,810,102.
The Commissioner of l'ensions says U is
the intention of the department to employ
all legal means to break up the existing
practice of a certain class ot brokers in
taking certificates from pensioners as col
lateral for money advanced. Suits to test
the constitutionality of the law forbidding
this practice are now pending in Philadel
phia and Boston.
Died.
New Haven, Conn., December 7.—
Prof. Van Brening died yesterday from the
amputation of a diseased loot. When be
came to this country, several years ago, he
had seventy-five thousand dollars, which
he lost gambling, and finally became a
tramp and misanthrope.
A New Land Bill.
Wash ington, December,?.—Representa
tive Payson, of Illinois, will on Monday in
troduce a bill in the House for the forfei
ture of 50.000,000 acres of unearned land
grants, heading the list with 15,000,000 of
acres claimed by the Texas Pacific road.
This act will also prohibit the commu
tation until two years have elapsed from
date ol settlement, one year of which must
be of record in the Land office. It also re
peals the provision of the law under which
local laud officers are authorized to receive
relinquishments and immediately throw
the claims relinquished open to entry. In
effect, it requires all relinquishments to be
lorwarded to the Commissioner of the Gen
eral Land office and be approved by him
before the land in question can be thrown
open to entry. The effect of these various
measures, if they become laws, will be to
limit the amount ol public land a single
individual can secure to one claim of one
hundred and sixty acres. Land may be
secured after two years actual residence
thereon and paying one dollar and twenty
five cents per acre for it; after five years
residence for nothing.
The provision in respect to relinquish
ments is designed to put a stop to the prac
tice of filing entries upon public lands and
holding them for the purpose of selling re
linquishments to incoming settlers. Under
the entry laws a citizen may obtain three
claims, one each under the homestead, pre
emption and timber culture laws. He se
cures the timber culture claim without res
idence and may purchase pre-emption and
homestead claims after six months actual
residence.
The Mormon Problem.
Salt Lake,D ecember 7.—The Salt Lake
Herald , a Mormon journal owned by John
T. Kaine, the Mormon delegate in Con
gress, and others, says of the President's
Utah recommendations this morning:
"This is one of the most sweeping meas
ures that have been proposed for the coer
cion of Utah. It is full of evil possibilities,
which become probabiliiies when we reflect
upon the character of the persons who
would likely have the enforcement of the
statute. When Arthur recommends the
adoption of such extraordinary measure for
dealing with the Mormon problem as this,
it is evident that he contemplates vigorous
action in Congress, by placing the matter
in his hands and giving him full swing,
according to his ambitious inclination.
However, we do not apprehend the occur
rence of anything serious or radical in the
immediate future. True, Arthur has gone
further than auy of his predecessors in the
matter of recommendations, but it will
take trouble to recall the events of the
past twelve years. We well understand
the cause of the present anti-Mormon
storm raging through the land more than
that of the storms which have broke out
previous to the assembling of Congress
every winter within the recollection of the
people of this generation.''
The question is being discussed all over
the Territory. The church leaders are
much agitated.
Peaceful Settlement.
Washington, December 7.—The Com
missioner of Indian Allairs received the
following dispatch which he regards as evi
dence of the successful and peaceful settle
ment ot the long existing troubles among
tho Creek Indians :
"Muscogee, Indian Territory, December
7.—To the Commissioner of Indian Affairs,
Washington : Perryman inaugurated as
Chief of the Creeks. Isparheche and Chi
cota elected delegates to Washington. Ar
rangements satisfactory. All quiet.
