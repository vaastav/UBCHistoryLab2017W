The President's Message
EXECCTIVK MANSION, I
a.shingtou, I). C., December 4. 1882.
l'o tin Senate ami House of Representative!*
of the United States-
It is provided by the constitution that the
President shall from time to time give con­
gress information of the state of the Union and
recommend to their consideration such meas­
ures as he shall judge necessary and expedient.
Foreign Affairs.
In reviewing the events of the year whioh
has elapsed since the commencement of your
sessions. I first call your attention to the
gratifying condition of our foreign affair*. Our
intercourse with other powers has continued
to be of the most friendly character. Such
slight differences as have arisen during the
yenr have been already settled, or are likely to
reach an early adjustment.
The arrest of citizens of the United States in
Ireland under the recent laws which owe their
origin to the disturbed condition of that coun­
try. has led to a somewhat extended correspon­
dence with the government of Great Britain
A. disposition to respect our rights has been
practieallv manifested by the release of the ar­
rested parties.
The claim of the nation in regard to the
supervision and control of any inter-oceauic
canal across the American isthmus has con­
tinued to be the subject of conference. It is
likely that time will be more powerful than
discussion in removing the divergence between
the two nations whose friendship is so closely
cemented by the intimacy of their relatious ancl
the community of their interest.
Our loug established friendliness with Knssia
has remained unbroken. It has prompted me
to proffer the earnest counsel of this govern­
ment. that measures be adopted for suppress­
ing the proscription which the Hebrew race in
that country has lately suffered. It has not
transpired that any American citizen has been
subjected to arrest or injury, but our courteous
remonstrance has nevertheless been courteously
received. There is reason to believe the time
is not far distant when llussia will be able to
-ecure tolt ration to all faiths within her borders.
At an international convention held at Paris
iti lSSn and attended by representatives of the
United States, r.n agreement was reached in
respect to the protection of trade marks, pat­
ented articles and the rights of manufacturing
tirms and corporations. The formulating into
treaties of the recommendations thus adopted,
is receiving the attention which it merits.
The protection of submarine cables is a sub­
ject now under consideration by an interna­
tional conference at Talis. Believing that it is
eh arly the true policy of this goverment to
favor the neutralization of this means of in­
tercourse, I requested our minister to France
to attend the convention as a delegate. I also
designated two of our eminent scientists to
attend as our representatives at the meeting of
an international committee at Paris for consid­
ering the adoption of a common unit to meas­
ure electric force. In view of the frequent oc­
currence of conferences for the consideration
of important matters of common interest, to
eivihz'd nations. I respectfully suggest that
tho executive be invested by congress with dis­
cretionary power to send delegates to such con­
vent ions and that provision be made to defray
\penses incid nt thereto.
The difference between the United States and
Nnain as to the offect of a judgment and cer
tiiicate of naturalization has not yet been ad­
justed. but it is hoped and believed negotia­
tions now iu progress will result in the estab­
lishment of a position whioh seems to this gov­
ernment reasonable and just. I have already
••ailed the attention of congress to the fact that
in the exports of Spain and its colonies numer­
ous tines have lately been imposed upon vessels
of the United States for trivial technical
offenses against local regulations. Efforts for
the abatement of these exactions have thns far
proved unsuccessful. I regret to inform yon
also that the fees demanded by Spanish con­
suls in American ports are in some cases so
large wheu compared with the value of the
cargo, as to amount in effect to a considerable
expoit duty, and that our remonstrances in this
regard have nut as yet received the attention
which they seem to deserve.
The German government has invited the
United States to participate in an international
xlnbition of domestic cattle, to be held in
Hamburg iu July. 1833. If this country is to
be represented it is important that in the early
days of this session congress should make an
appropriation for that purpose.
The death of Mr. Marsh, our late minister to
Italy, has evoked :from that government ex­
pressions of profound respect for his exalted
character and for his honorable career in the
diplomatic service of his country. The Italian
government has raised a question as to the pro
pri"ty of recognizing in his dual capacity the
lepresentatives of this country recently accred­
ited as secretary of the legation and as consul
general. He has been received as secretary,
but his credentials as consul general has thus
far been withheld.
The extradition convention with Belgium,
which has hem in operation since 1874, has
been lately supplanted by another. The senate
has signified its approval, and ratifications have
been duly exchanged between the contracting
countries. To the list of extraditable crimes
has been added that of the assassination or at­
tempted assassination of the chief of state.
Negotiations have been opened with Switzer­
land looking to a settlement by treaty of the
question whether its citizens can renounce their
allegiance and become citizens of the United
states without obtaining the consent of the
Swiss government. I am happy to inform you
that the immigration of paupers and criminals
from certain of the cantons of Switzerland has
subsequently ceased and is no longer sanctioned
by the authorities.
The consideration of this subject prompts
the suggestion that the act of August 3d, 1882,
which lias for its object the return of foreign
convicts to their own country, should be so
modified as not to be open to the enterprise.
It effects the extradition of criminals of pre­
ferred charges of crime. The Ottoman porte
has not yet assented to the interpretation
which this government ha8 put upon the treaty
of 1830 relative to its jurisdictional rights iu
Turkey It may well be, however, that this
difference will be adjusted by a general revi­
sion of the system of jurisdiction of the United
States in the* countries of the east—a subject to
which your attention has been already called
by the secretary of state
In the interest of justice toward Chili and
Japan 1 trust that the question of the return of
the indemnity fund to the governments of
those countries will reach at the present session
the satisfactory solution which I have already
recommended and which has recently been fore­
shadowed by congressional discussion.
The treaty lately concluded with Corea awaits
the action of the senate.
During the late disturbance in Eygpt the
timely presence of American vessels served as a
protection to the persons and property of many
of our own citizens and of citizens of other
countries whose governments have expressed
their thanks for this assistance.
The recent legislation restricting immigration
of laborers from China has given rise to the
question of whether Chinese passing to or
from another country may lawfully pass
through our own. In constrting the act of
May 6, 1882. in connection with the treaty of
November 7th, 1880. the restriction would
seem to be limited to Chinese immigrants com­
ing to the United States as laborers and should
not forbid a mere transit across our territory.
I ask the attention of congress to the subject
for such action, if any, as may be deemed ad­
visable.
This government has recently had occasion
to manifest interest in the republic of Liberia
by seeking to aid the amicable settlement of
the boundary dispute between that' republic
aud the British possession of Sien a Leone.
The reciprocity treaty With'Hawaii will be­
come terminable"after September 1, 1883, on.
two months' notice by either party. While
certain provisions of that compact may have
proved onerous, its existence has fastened
commercial relations which it is important to
preserve. I suggest, therefore, that early
cousideration lie given to such modifications of
the treaty as seem to be demanded by the in­
terests of our people.
In view of our increasing trade with both
Hayti and Ban Domingo, I advise that pro­
vision be made for diplomatic intercourse with
the latter, by enlarging to scope of the mission
at Port Au Prince. I regret that certain claims
of American citizens against the government of
Hayti have thus far been urged unavailiogly.
A recent agreement with Mexico provides
for the crossing of the frontier by the armed
forces of either country in pursuit of hostile
Indians. In my message of last year I called
attention to the prevalent lawlessness on the
borders and to the necessity of legislation for
its suppression. I again invite the attention [of
congress to the subject. A partial relief frohf
these mischiefs has been sought in a conven­
tion whioh now asks the approval of the sen­
ate. as doeH another touching the establish­
ment of the international boundary between
the United States and Mexico. If the latter is
ratified the action "of congress will.be required
for the establishment of suitable commissions
of survey. The boundary dispute between
Mexico and Guatemala which led this goyern
ment to prefer its friendly counsels to both
parties has been amicably settled.
No change has occurred in our relations'tfith:
Venezuela. I again invoke your action in the
matter of the pending awards against that re­
public to which reference was made by a special
message, from the executive at your last session.
An invitation has been received from the gov­
ernment of Venezuela to send representatives
in July, 1883, to Carhccas for participating' in
the centennial celebration of the birth*" of
Bolivar, the founder of South American inde­
pendence. In conocction with the event it is.
designed to commence the erection at Caraccas
of a statue of JjVasJiingtQki, and to conduct an

the occupation bv Chili in 1880, of all the prin­
cipal portion of the territory of Bolivia, nego­
tiations for peace were conducted under the
direction of the United States. The allies re­
fused to concede any-territory,-but Chili has
since become master of the whole coast of
both countries, and of the capital of Peru. A
year since, as you have already been advised by
correspondence transmitted to you in January
last, this government sent a special mission
to the belligerent powers to express the hope
that Chili would be disposed to accept a money
indemnity for the expenses of the war and to
relinquish her demand for a portion of the
territory from her antagonist. This recom­
mendation, which Chili declined to follow, this
government did not assume to enforce nor can
it be enforced without resort to a measure
which would be in keeping neither with the
temper of our people nor with
the spirit of our institutions. The
power "of Peru no longer extends over its
whole territory, and the event of onr interfer­
ence to declare peace would need to be sup­
plemented by the armies and navies of the
United States. Such interference would
almost inevitably lead to the establishment of
a protectorate—a result utterly at odds with
our past policy, injurious to our present inter­
ests and full of embarrassments for the
future, for effecting the termination
of hostilities on terms at once just to
the victorious nation and generous to its ad­
versaries. This government has spared
no efforts to save such as might involve the
complications which I have indicated, it is
greatly to be deplored that Chili seems resolved
to exact such rigorous conditions of peace aud
indisposed to submit to arbitration the terms
cf an amicable settlement. No peace is likely
to be lasting that ia.uot. sufficiently equitable
and just to commend the approval of other
nations.
About a year since invitations were extended
the nations of this continent to send repre­
sentatives to a peace congress, to assemble at
Waslungtou in November, 1882. The time of
meeting was fixed at a period then remote, in
the hope, as the luvitation itself declared, that
in the meantime the disturbances between
South American republics would be adjusted.
As that expectation seemed unlikely to be
realized, I asked in April last for au expression
of opinion from the two houses of congress as
to the advisability of holding the conventionat
the time appointed. This action was prompted
in part by doubts which mature reflection had
suggested, whether the diplomatic usage and
traditions of the government did not make it
fitting that the executive should consult the
representatives of the people before pursuing
a line of policy somewhat novel in its character
aud far reaching in its possible consequences.
In view of the fact that no action was taken by
congress in the premises and no provision had
been made for necessary expenses, I subse­
quently decided to postpone the convocation,
and so notified the several governmonts which
had been invited to attend. I am uuwilling to
dismiss this subject without assuring you of
my support of any measures the wisdom of
congress may devise for the promotion of
peace on this continent and throughout the
\vcrid. I trust that the time is nigh wheu with
the universal assent of civilized people all in­
ternational differences will be determined
without lesort to arms ly the benignant pro­
cess of arbitration.
Changes have occurred the diplomatic
representation of several foreign powers during
the past year. New ministers from the Argen­
tine Republic, Austria. Hungary, Brazil, China,
France, Japan, Mexico, the Netherlands and
Prussia have presented their credentials. The
missions of Denmark and Venezuela at this
capital have been raised iu grade. Switzerland
has created a plenipotentiary mission to this
government, and an embassy from Madagascar
and a minister from Sis in will shortly arrive.
Our diplomatic intercourse has been enlarged
by the establishment of relations with the new
Kingdom of Servia, by the creation of a mis­
sion to Siam and by the restoration of the
mission to Greece. The shah of Persia has
expressed his gratification that a charge de' af­
fairs will shortly be sent to that country where
the rights of our citizens have been hitherto
courteously guarded by the representatives of
Great Britain.
I renew my recommendation of such legisla­
tion as will'place the United States in har
mouy with other maritime powers with respect
to the international rules for the prevention of
collisions at sea.
In conformity with your joint resolution of
the 3d of August last, I have directed the
secretary of state to address foreign govern­
ments in respect to the proposed conference
for considering the subject of the universal
adoption of a common prime meridian tn be
used in the reckoning of longitude and the
regulation of time throughout the civilized
world. Their replies will in due time he laid

An agreement was reached at Paris iu 187 5
between the principal powers for an interchange
of official publications through the medium of
their respective foreign departments. The ad­
mirable system which has been built up by the
enterprise of the Smithsonian Institute, af­
fords a practical basis for our co-operation in
this scheme and an arrangement has been ef­
fected by which that institution will perform
the necessary labor under the direction of the
department of state. A reasonable compensa­
tion herefor should be provided by law.
A lause in the act makiug appropriations for
the diplomatic and consular service contem­
plates the reorganization of both branches of
such service on a salaried basis, leaving the
fees inure to the benefit of the treasury. I
cordially favor such a project as likely to correct
abuses in the present system. The secretary
of state will present to yon at an early day a
plan for such reorganization.
The Treasury*
A full and interesting exhibit of the opera­
tions of the treasury department is afforded by
the report of the secretary:

During the year there have feeeu organized
171 national banks, and of those institutions
there are now in operation 2,269, a larger num­
ber than ever before. The value of their notes
in active circulation on July 1, 1882, was $324,
657,458. I recommend to your attention the
secretary's views: in respect'to the likelihood of
.a serious contraction of this circulation and to
the modes by which that result' may, in his
judgment, be averted.
The mass of accumulated coin has grown so
great that the vault room at present available
for storage is scarcely sufficient to contain it.
It is not apparent why it is desirable to con­
tinue this coinage now so enormously in excess
of the public demand.
As to the silver certificates, in addition to the
grounds which: seemed last year to justify their
retirement, may be mentioned the effect which
is likely to ensue from the supply of gold .cer­
tificates for whence issuance congress recently
'made provision, and which are now in inactive
circulation.
InTcspect to the coinage of silver dollars
and retirement of silver certificates,. I have
seen nothing to' alter butmuoh to con^im tlje'
sentimenta to which I gave expression Jiu»t

You cannot fail to note with interest tha die-*
cuasios by the secretary as to the necessity, of
providing by legislation some mo^eof freeing
the treasury of an .excess of assets.' In the
event that congress falls t6 reafcb an early
•agreement for the reduction- of taxation I
heartily approve the secretary's recommends
tionof immediate and exteniite deduction in
the fcnnual Tevenues ofgov«nu»ent. It mil
be remembered that I urged upon the action
of congress at its last session the
importance of relieving the industry
and enterprise of the country from pressure
of unnecessary taxation. It is one of the truest
maxims of political economy that all taxes are
burdensome however wisely and prudently im­
posed, and though there have always "been
among onr people wide differences
of sentiment
as to the best methods of raising the national
revenues, and, indeed, as to the principles up­
on which taxation should be based, there has
beeu substantial accord in the doctrine that
only snch taxes ought to be levied as are neces­
sary for a wise and economical administration
of the government. Of late the public revenues
have far exceeded that limit, and unless checked
by appropriate legislation such excess will con­
tinue to increase from year to year. For the
fiscal year ended Jnue 30th, 1881, the surplus
revenue amounted to 8100,000,000. For the
fiscal year ended on the 30th of June, last, the
surplus was more than $145,000,000. The re­
port of the secretary shows what disposition
has been made of these moneys. They have
not only answered the requirements of the
sinking fund, but have afforded a large
balance applicable to other reductions of
the public debt. But I renew the expression of
my conviction that such ra£id extinguishment
of national indebtedness as is now taking place
is by no means a cause for congratulation it is
a cause rather for serious apprehension. If it
continues it must speedily be followed by one
of tho evil results so clearly set forth in the
report of the secretary. Either the surplus
must lie idle in the treasury or the government
will be forced to buy at market rates
its bonds not then redeemable, and
which under such circumstances can­
not fail to command ah enormous
premium, or the swollen revenues will be de­
voted to extravagant expenditures which as
experience has taught is ever the bane of au
overflowing treasury. It was made apparent
in tho course of the animated discussions which
this question aroused at tho last session of
congress that the policy of diminishing the
revenue by reducing taxation, commanded
general approval of the members of both
houses. I regret that, ecause, conflicting as
to the best methods which that policy should
be made operative, none of its benefits have
been reaped. In the fulfillment of what I
deem my constitutional duty, but with little
hope that I can make valuable contribution to
this vexed question, I shall proceed to intimate
briefly my own views in relation to it:
Upon the showing of our fiuaucial condition
at tho close of th» last fiscal year, I felt justi­
fied In recommending to congress the abolition
of internal revenue taxes, except those upon
tobacco in its various forms and upon distilled
spirits and fermented liquors, and except also
the specialjtax upon the manufacturer and deal­
ers iu such articles. I venture now to suggest
that unless it shall be ascertained
that the probable expenditures of the
government for the coming year have been
under-estimated the international taxes save
those which relate to distilled spirits can be
prudently abrogated. Such action, accom­
panied by a simplification of the machines of
collection which would then be easy of accom­
plishment, might reasonably be expected to
result in diminishing the cost of such' collec­
tion at least two millions and a half of dollars,
and in the retirement from office of from 1,500
to 2,000 persons. The system of excise duties
has never commended itself to the favor of
the American people and has never been re­
sorted to except for supplying deficiencies
in the treasury when bv reason of special
exigencies the duties on imports have proved
inadequate to the needs ot the government.
The sentiment of the country doubtless com­
mands that the present excise tax shall be
abolished as soon as such a course can safely
be pursued. It seems to me, however, for
various reasons, so sweeping a meaauro as the
total abolition of internal taxes would for the
present be an unwise step. Two of these rea­
sons are deserving of special mention. First,
it is by no means clear that even
if tho existing system of duties on
imports is continued without modification
those duties alone will yield revenue for all the
needs of the government. It is estimated that
one hundred millions of dollars will be re­
quired for pensions during tho coming year,
and it may well be doubted whether the maxi­
mum annual demand for that object has yet
beeu reached. The uncertainty upon this ques­
tion would alone justify, in my judgment, the
retention for the present of the portion of the
system of internal ICvenue which is least ob­
jectionable tothe people. Second, a total abo­
lition of excise taxes would almost prove a
serious if not an unsurmountable objection to
a thorough revision of the tariff and to any
considerable reduction in import duties.
The present tariff system is in many respects
unjust. It makes unequal distribution, both of
its burdens aud its benefits. This fact was
practically recognized by a majority of each
house of congress in the passage of the act cre­
ating the tariff commission. The report of
that committee will be placed before you at the
beginning of this session, and will, I trust, af­
ford you such information as to the condition
and prospect of the various commercial, agri­
cultural, manufacturing, mining and other in­
terests of the country and contain such sug­
gestions for statutory revision as will practi­
cally aid your action'upou this important ques­
tion.
The revenue from customs for the fiscal
year ending June 30, 1879 amounted to 8137,
(M'O.OOO. It has in the three succeeding years
reached first §186,000,000 then ¥198,00*0,000
aud finally, as has been already stated $220.
l00,000. The iueonic from this service for the
fiscal year which will end on June 30, 1883, will
doubtless be considerably in excess of the sum
last mentioned if ta~v ou domestic spirits is to
be retained. It is plain, therefore, that large
reductions from the customs revenue are en­
tirely feasible. While recommending this re­
duction I am far from advising
the abandonment of the policy of
so discriminating in the adjustment of details
as to afford aid and protection to domestic la­
bor. But the present system should be so re­
vised as to equalize the public burden among
all classes and occupations and bring it into
closer harmony with the present needs of in­
dustry. Without entering into minute detail
whicri under present circumstances is quite un­
necessary, I recommend an enlargement of the
free list so as to include within it the numer­
ous articles which yield inconsiderable revenue,
a simplification of the complex and
inconsistent schedule of duties upon
certain manufactures particularly those
of cotton, iron and steel and a substantial re­
duction of the duties upon those articles and
upon sugar, molaspes, silk, wool and woolen
goods. If a general revision of the tariff shall
be found to be impracticable at this session I
express the hope that at least some of the mora
conspicuous inequalities of the present law may
be corrected before your final adjournment.
One of them is especially referred to by the
secretary. In view of the recent decision of
the supreme court the necessity of amending
the law by which the duties staudard of color
is adopted as the test of the saccharine strength
of sugars is too obvious to require comment.
The War Department
From the report of the secretary of war it
appears that the only outbreaks of Indians dur­
ing the past year occurred in Arizona and the
southwestern part of Mexico. They were
promptly quelled and the quiet which has pre­
vailed in all other parts of the country has per­
mitted such an addition to be made to the
military force in the region endangered by the
Apaches, that there is little reason to appre­
hend trouble in future.
Those parts of the secretary's report which
relate to our sea coast defenses and their arma­
ment- suggest the gravest reflections. Our exist­
ing fortifications are notoriously inadequate to
the defense of the great harbors and cities for
whoso protection they were built. The ques­
tion of providing an armament suited to our
present necessities has been the subject of con­
sideration by aboard whose report was trans­
mitted to congress at the last session. Pending
the consideration of that report the war de­
partment has taken no steps for the manufac­
ture or conversion of any heavy cannon, but
the secretary expresses the hope that authority
and means to begin that important work will
soon be provided.
I invite the attention of congress to the pro­
priety of making more adequate provisions for
arming and eqnipping the militia than is
afforded by the act of 1806, which is still upon
the statute books. The matter has already
been tho subject of discussion in the senate and
a bill which seeks to supply..the deficiencies of
existing laws is now upon its calendar.
The secretary of war calls attention to the
fact that an embarrassment has grown out of
the recent act of congress making tbo retire­
ment of officers of the army compulsory at the
age of 64, with the act of 1878, which is still
in force, which limits to 400 the number of
those who can be retired for disability or upon
their own application. The two acts when con­
strued together seem to forbid the relieving
even for absolute incapacity of officers whondo
not faljUwithin the purview of the latter atatfitel
save pirsuch timcto as th^re chance to fee fes®
than 400 names on the retired list. ••There are
now 420. It is not likely that congress intended
this result and I concur with the secretary that
the law ought to be amended.
The grounds that induced me to withhold
my signature from the bill entitled, an act
making appropriations for the construction, te
pair and perservation of certain works on
rivers and harbors, which became a law near
the close of your last session, prompt me to ex­
press the hope that no similar measure will be

"the -greater portion-of -the sum- appropriated
for the various items specified in that act re­
mains unexpended. Of the new works which
it authorized, expenses have been incurred
upon two only, for which the total appropria­
tion was $2*10,000. The present available
balance is disclosed by the following tables:

It is apparent by this exhibit that so far as
concerns most of the items to wnich the act of
August 2, 1882, relates, there can be no need
of further appropriations until after the close
of the present session. If, however, any ac
tion should seem to be necessary in respect to
particular objects, it will be cntuely feasiable
to provide for those objects by appropriate leg­
islation. It is possible, for example, that
a delay until the assembling of
the next congress to make additional
provision for the Mississippi River improvement
might bo attended with serious consequences.
If such should appear to be the case, a just
bill relating to that subject would command
my approval. This leads me to offer the sug­
gestion, which I trust will commend itself to
the wisdom of congress: Is it not advisable
that grants of considerable sums of money for
diverse and independent schemes of interna­
tional improvement should be made the sub­
jects of separate and distinct legislative
enactments? It will scarcely be gainsaid
even by those who favor the most liberal ex
penditures for such purposes as are sought to
be accomplished by what is commonly called
the river and harbor bill, that tho practice of
grouping in such a bill appropriations for a
great diversity of objects widely separated,
either in their nature, iu the locality with
which tbey are concerned, or in both, is cue
which is much to be deprecated. Unless it is
irremediable it is inevitably tending to secure
the success of the bill as a whole, though many
of the terms if separately considered, could
scarcely fail of rejection by the adoption
of the course I have recommended
every member of congress whenever opportu­
nity should arise for requiring his influence
and vote for meritorious appropriations would
be enabled so to dowithout being called upon to
sanction others undeserving of nis approval so
also would the executive be afforded thereby a
full opportunity to exercise his constitutional
prerogative ot opposing whatever appropria­
tions seemed to him objectionable without im­
periling the success of others which com­
mended themselves to his judgment.
It may be urged in opposition to
these suggestions that the number of woiks of
internal improvement which are justly entitled
to governmental aid is so great as to render
impracticable separate appropriation bills
theiefor, and even for such comparatively lim­
ited number as make disposition of large sums
of money. This subject may be well founded,
and whether it be or not the advantages whichl
would be likely to ensue from the adoption of
the course I have recommended may perhaps
be more effectually attained by another which
I respectfully submit to congress as an alterna­
tive proposition.
It is provided by the constitutions of four­
teen of our states that the executive may dis­
approve any item or items of a bill appropriat­
ing money, whereupon the part of the bill ap­
proved shall be law and the part disapproved
thall fail to become law unless repassed, ac­
cording to the provisions prescribed for the
paasage of bills over the veto of the execu­
tive. The states wherein some such provis­
ions as the foregoing is a funda­
mental law are: Alabama, California, Colorado,
Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, Minnesota. Mis­
souri. Nebraska, New Jersey, New York, Penn­
sylvania and West Virginia. I commend to
your careful consideration the question
whether the amendment of the federal consti­
tution in the particular indicated would not af­
ford the best remedy for what is often a grave
embarrassment both to members of congress
and to the executive and is sometimes a serious
public mischief.
Tine .Navy.
The report of the secretary of the navy states
the movements of the various squadrons dur
during the year in home and foreign waters,
where our officers and seamon. with such ships
as we possess, have continued to illustrate the
high character and excellent discipline of the
naval organization. On the 21st of December,
1881, information was received that
the exploring steamer Jeannette had
been crushed and abandoned in the Arctic
Ocean. The officers and crew, after a journey
over the ice, embarked in three boats for the
coasts of Siberia. One of the parties, under
the command of Chief Engineer George W.
Melville, reached the land, and falling in with
natives was saved. Another under Lieutonant
Commander De Long, lauded in a barren
region near the mouth of the Lena lliver.
After six weeks had elapsed all but two of the
number had died from fatigue aud starvation.
No tiding-! have been received from
the party in the third boat under the
command of Lieutenant Chipp, but along and
fruitless investigation leaves little doubt Uiat
all its members perished at sea. As a slight
tribute to their heroism I give in this com
munication the names of the gallant men who
sacrificed their lives on the expedition: Lieut.
Commander Geo. W. De Long, Surgeon James
M. Ambler, Jerome J. Collins, Hans Haller
Erickson, Heinrich Kaacki, Leo A. Bryde,
Walter Lee, Adolph Dressier, Carl A. Gortz,
Nelse Iverson, the cook, Ah Sam, and
the Indian Atexy. The officers and
men in the missing boat were Lieut, Chas. W.
Chip]), commanding. Wm. Dunbar. Alfred
Sweetman, Walter Sharteil, Albert C. Kuehne,
Edwin St -. Henry Warren and Peter E. John­
son. I.ii-lit. GiU J. Ilarber aud Master Wm.
IT. SchentZ'. kiccli are now bringing home the
remains of Lieut. De Long aud his comrades.
Iu pursuance of the direction of congress the
liodgers fitted out for the relief of the Jean­
nette in accordance with the act of congress of
March 3. 1881, sailed from San Francisco June
16, under the command of Lieut. Robt. M.
Berry. On November 30, she was accidentally
destroyed by fire while in St. Lawrence Bay,
but the officers and crew succeeded in escaping
to the land. Lieut. Berry and one of hia of­
ficers, after making a search for the
Jeannette along the coast of Siberia,
fell in with Chief Engineer Melville's
party and returned home by way of Europe.
The* other officers and crew of the Rodgers
were brought from St. Lawrence Bay by the
whaling steamer North Star. ilr. Chas. F.
Putnam, who has been placed charge of a
depot of supplies at Cape Serdze, returning to
his post from St. Lawreuce Bay, in a blinding
snow storm, was carried out to sea and lost,
notwithstanding all efforts to rescue.
It appears by the secretary's report that the
available naval force of the United States con­
sists of thirty-seven cruisers, fourteen single
turretcd monitors built during the rebellion, a
large numoer of smooth-bore guns and parrot
rifles and eighty-seven rifled cannon. The
cruising vessels should be 'gradually replaced
Tiv iron or steel ships, the monitors by modern
armored vessels and the armament, by high
power liiied guns. Tho reconstruction of our
navv which was recommended in the last mes­
sage was begun by congress authorizing in its
recent act the construction of two large un
armored steel vessels of th'e character reccom
meiided by the late navy advisory board and
subject to* the final approval of anew advisory
board to be organized as provided by that act.
I call your attention to the recommendation
of the secretary of the board that
authority be given to construct two more
cruisers of smaller dimensions and one fleet
dispatch vessel, and that appropriations be
made for high-power rifled cannon, for torpedo
service and for other harbor defenses. Peud
ing the consideration by congress of the policy
to be hereafter adopted in conducting the eight
large navv yards and their expensive estab­
lishments, the secretary advocated a reduc­
tion of expenditures therefor to the lowest
possible amounts.
For the purpose of affording the officers an$
seamen of the navy opportunities of exercise
and discipline in their profession, under ap­
propriate control and directions the secre
•tary advises that the light house service and
coast survey be transferred as now organized
from the treasury to the navy department and
ho also suggests for the reason which he as­
signs that a similar transfer may wisely be
made of the cruising^revenue vessels..
The secretary forcibly depicts the intimate
connection and interdependence of the nkvv
and the commcrcial marine, and invites atten­
tion to the continued decadence of the latter
and the corresponding transfer of. our growing
commerce to foreign bottoms. This subject is
one of the utmost importance to the national
welfare. The methods of revivitig American
ship building and of restoring the United
States flag on the ocean carrying
trade should receive the immediate at­
tention of congress. We have mechanical
skill aud abnndant material for the manufac­
ture of modern iron steamships in fair compe­
tition with our commercial rivals. Our disad­
vantage in building ships is the greater'cost of
labor and sailing them, higher taxes and
greater interest on capital, while the ocean
highways are already monopolized by ouif, for­
midable competitors these obstacles should in
aome way be overcome imd for onr rapid com-,
munipation with, foreign lands we should not
continue to depend wholly on vessels built in
the yards of other 'countries and sailing under
foreign flags. With no U. S. steamers on tho
principal ocean lii)es. or for any foreign: ports,
our facilities for extending oui* commerce are
greatly restricted, while the nations which build
the ships and carry mail and passengers obtain
thereby conspicuous advantages,' increasing
their'trade.
The I'ofttefHce Department
The'report of the postmaster, general gives
evidence of the satisfactory condition of thai
department," arid'eotafftitiM many "valuable datft
and accompanying suggestions which canqot
fail to be of interest. The infomiation which
it affords that the receipts for 'tne fiscal year
have exceeded the expenditures must be very
gratifying to congress and to the people of the
cotmtry. As matters which may fairly claim
particular attention, I refer to hie) observations
in reference to the advisability of, ohanging the
present basis.for fixing salaries^ and allowances,
of extending the money-order system, of en­
larging the functions ofpostal establishments
so afi & bring under its control the telegraph
system of the coun'try, ithotigh fnom this last
and most important Recommendation I must
withhold my cqneuvrence.
At the laqt ggs^bu of icjoftgxess, several, bills
were introduced into the nouse 6f representa-
tion would be far to the best interests of the
public. It has been the policy of the govern­
ment from its foundation to defray as far as
possible the expenes of carrying the mails by
a direct tax in the form of postage. It has
never been claimed, however, that this service
ought to be productive of a net revenue. As
has been stated already, the report of the post*
master general shows that there
is now a very considerable surplus
in his department and that henceforth
the receipts are likely to increase in a much
greater ratio than the necessary expenditure.
UnlesB some change is made in the existing
aws, the profits of the postal service will in a
very few years swell the revenues of the gov­
ernment many millions of dollars. 'The time
seems auspicious, therefore, for some reduc­
tion in the rates of postage. Iu what shall
that reduction consist A review of the legis­
lation which has been had upou the subject
during the last thirty years, discloses that do­
mestic letters constitute the only class of mail
matter which has never been fa­
vored by a substantial reduction of
rates. I am convinced that the burden of
maintaining the service falls most unequally
upon that class and that more than any other,
it is entitled to present relief. That such
relief may be extended without detriment to
otlier public interests, will be discovered upon
reviewing the results of former reductions.
Immediately prior to the act of 1845 the postage
upon a letter composed of a single sheet was as
follows: If conveyed 30 miles or less, 6 cents
between 30 and 80 miles, 10 cents between 80
and 150 miles, 12^ cents, between 150 and 400
miles, 13% over 400 miles, 25 cents. By the
act of 1845 the postage upon a single letter
conveyed for any distance under 300
miles was fixed at 5 cents, and for
any greater distance at 10 cents.
By the act of 1851, it was provided that a sin­
gle letter if prepaid should be carried any dis­
tance not exceeding 300 miles for three cents
and any greater distance for six cents. It will
be noticed that both of these reductions were
of a radical character and relatively quite as
important as that now proposed. In each case
there ensued a temporary loss of revenue,
but a sudden and large influx of busi­
ness which substantially paid that loss
in three years. Unless the experience
of past legislation in this country and else
where goes for naught, it may be safely pre­
dicted that the stimulus of a 50 per cent, re­
duction in tax for carriage would at once in­
crease the number of letters consigned to the
mails, the advantages of secrecy would lead to
a very general substitutiou of sealed packets
for postal cards and open circulars, and in
divers other ways the volume of first class mat­
ter would be euormously augmented. Such
increase amounted in England in the first year
after the adoption of penny postage to rnoro
than 125 per cent. As a result a careful
estimate, the details of which cannot here
be set out, I have become convinced
that the deficiency for tho first year after the
proposed reduction would not exceed 7 per
cent, of the expenditures or $3,000,000, while
the deficiency after the reduction of 1845 was
more than 14 per cent., and after that of 1851
was 27 per cent. Another interesting com­
parison is afforded by statistics fnrnished me
by the postoffice department. The act of 1845
was passed in the face of the fact that there
existed a deficiency of more than $30,000.
Ibatof 1851 was encouraged hv the slight
surplus of 8132,000.
The excess of revenue in the next fiscal year is
likely to be 87,500,000. If congress should ap
pr ova these suggestions it may be deemed de­
sirable to supply to some extent the deficiency
which must for'a time result, by increasing the
charge for carrying merchandise, which is now
only 16 cents per pound. But even without
such an increase am confident the receipts un­
der the diminished rates would equal the ex
penditures after the lapse of three or four
years.
Department of Justice.
The report of the aopartment of justice
briugs anew to your notice the necessity of
enlarging the present system of federal juris­
prudence so as to effectually answer tne re­
quirements of the ever-increasing litigation
with which it is called upon to deal. The at­
torney general renews the suggestions of his
predecessor that in the interests of justice bet­
ter provision than the existing laws afford
shoiild be made in certain judicial districts for
fixing the fees of witnesses and jurors.
In my message of December last I referred
to pending criminal proceedings growing out
of alleged frauds in what is known as the Star
route service of the postoffice department and
advised you that I had enjoined upon the at
tomey general and associate counsel to whpni
the interests of the government were entrust­
ed, the duty of prosecuting with the utmost
rigor of the law all persons who might be
fonnd chargeable with those offences. A trial
of one of these cases has since occurred. It
occupied for many weeks the at­
tention of the supreme court of this
district aud was conducted with great zeal and
ability. It resulted in a disagreement of the
jmy, but the cause has again been placed upon
the* calendar and will shortly be retried. If
any guilty peivons shall finally escape punish­
ment for their offences, it will not be for lack
of diligent and urgent work of the prosecution.
I trust that some agreement will be reached
which will speedily aid congress with the con
currence of the executive to afford the com­
mercial community the benefits of a national
bankrupt law.
The Interior Department.
The report of the secretary of the interior,
with its accompanying documents, presents a
full statement of the varied operations of the
department. In respect to Indian affairs, noth­
ing has occurred which has changed or serious­
ly modified the views to which I devoted much
space in a former communication to congress,
I renew the recommendations therein contained
as to extending to the Indian the protection of
the law, allotting land in severalty to such as
deserve it and making suitable provision for
the education of the youth. Such provisions,
the secretary forcibly maintains, will prove un­
availing unless it is broad enough to include
all those who are able and willing to make use
of it and should not solely relate to intellectual
trainiug, but also instruction in such manual
labor and simple industrial arts aB can be
made particularly available.
Among other important subjects which are
included in the secretary's report and which
will doubtless furnish occasion for congres­
sional action, may be mentioned the neglect of
railroad companies to which large grants of
land were made by acts of 1862 and 1864, to take
the title thereto,' and their consequent in­
equitable exemption from local taxation.
No survey of our material condition can fail
to suggest inquiries as to the moral and intel­
lectual progress of the people. The census re­
turns disclose an alarming prevalence of illitera­
cy in certain portions of the country where
the provision for schools is grossly inadequate.
It is a momentous question for the decision of
congress whether immediate substantial aid
should lie extended by the general government
for supplementing the efforts of private bene­
ficence of state aud territorial legislation in
behalf of education
The regulation of internal commerce has al­
ready been the subject of your deliberations.
One of the incidents of the miraculous exten­
sion of the railway system of the country has
been adoption of' such measures by the cor­
porations which own or control the roads as
has tended to impair the advantages of health­
ful competition and make hurtful discrimina­
tions in the adjustment1 of freightage. These
inequalities have been corrected in several of
the^states by appropriate legislation, the effect
of which is necessarily restricted to the limits
of their own territory. So far as such mis­
chiefs affect commence between the states, or
between any of the states and a foreign country
they are subjects of national concern, and con­
gress alone can afford relief.
The results which have thus far attended
the enforcement of the recent statute for the
suppression of polygamy in tho territories are
reported by the secretary of the interior. It is
not probable that any additional legislation in
this regard will be deemed desirable until the
effect of tke existing laws shall be more closely
observed and studied. I congratulate you that
the commissioners under whose supervision
those laws have been put in operation are en­
couraged to believe thai the evil at which they
are aimed may be suppressed without- resort to
such radical measures as in some quarters have
been thought indispensable for success.
Tho close relation of the general government
to the territories preparing to be great states
may well engage your special attention. It is
there that the Indian disturbances mainly oc­
cur and that polygamy has found room for its
growth. I cannot.doubt that a careful survey
of territorial legislation would be of the highest
utility life and property would become more
secure, the liability of outbreaks between In­
dians and whites would be lessened, the public
domain would be more securely guarded, and
better progress made in the instruction of the
yeung.
Alaska is still without, any form of civil gov­
ernment. If means were provided for the edu­
cation of its people and for the protection of
their lives and property, the immense resources
of this region would, invite permanent settle
ment and open new fields for industry and
enterprise.
The. repcrt of the commissioner of agricul­
ture presents an account of labors of that de­
partment during the past fear and includes in­
formation of much interest to the. general pub
he. The condition of the forests of the coun
'try and the wasteful manner in which the de­
struction is taking place gives cause for seri­
ous apprehension. Theis action in protecting
the earth's surface, in modifying the extremes
of climate and regulating1 and sustaining
the flow of springs and streams, is not
well understpod, and their importance
in relation to the growth and prosperity at the'
country cannot be safely disregarded. They
are fast disappearing before tne destructive
fires and the legitimate requiremente of our
increasing population' and their total extinc­
tion cannot be long delayed unlegfijbetter
methods, than, now prevail shall be adopted for
their protection and' cultivation. The' atten
tion of congress is invited/ to the netaerity of
Additional legislation to Secure the preserva­
tion of the valuable forests 'still remaining bn'
the public' domain, especially in the1'extreme'
weetern sWteB und territories, wherethenec«H
aityfor their pl-eservation is greater than in less
mountainous regions and when th* prevailing
dryness of the climate renders their restoration
if they are once destroyed, well nigh impossible.
Civil Serrlee Reform.
The communication which I made to con­
gress at the first session in December last,
contained a somewhat full statement of my
sentiments in relation to the principles or
rales which ought to govern appointments to
the public service. Referring to the various
plans which heretofore had been subjected to
discussion in the national legislature, plans
which were in the main modeled
upon the system which obtains in
Great Britain, but which lacked cer­
tain of the prominent features whereby
that system is distinguished, I felt bound to
intimate my doubts whether they or any of
them would afford an adequate remedy for the
evils which they aimed to removed. I de­
clared, nevertheless, that if the proposed
measures should prove acceptable to congress
they would receive the unhesitating support of
the executive. Since the suggestions were
submitted for your consideration there has
been no legislation upon the subject to which
they relate, but there has meanwhile been an
increase in the public interest on that subject
and the people of the country1,
apparently without distinction of party, have
in various ways and upon frequent occasions
given expression to their earnest wish for
prompt and definite action. In my judgment
such action should no longer be postponed. I
may add that my owu sense of its pressing im­
portance has been quickened by observation in
a practical phase of the matter to which atten­
tion has more than once been called by my
predecessors. The civil list now comprises
about 100,000 persons, by far the larger part of
whom must, under the terms of the constitu­
tion, be selected by the President, either
directly or through his own appointees.
In the early years of the administration,
of the government the personal direction of
appointments to the civil service may not have
been an irksome task for tho executive, but
now that the burden has increased fully a hun­
dred fold, it has become greater than he ought
to bear and it necessarily diverts his time and
attention from the proper discharge of other
duties no less delicate and responsible, and
which, in the very nature of things cannot be
delegated to other hands. In the judgment of
not a few who have given study and reflection
to this matter, tho nation has outgrown the
provisions which the constitution has estab­
lished for filling the minor offices in the
public service. But whatever may be thought
of the wisdom or expediency of changing the
law in this regard it is certain that much relief
may be afforded not only to the President and
heads of the departments, but to senators and
representatives in congress bv discreet legisla­
tion. They would be protected in a great meas­
ure by the bill now pending before the senate
or by'any other which should embody important
features" to relieve the pressure of personal im
portunity and from the labor of examining
conflicting claims and pretentions of
candidates. I trust that before the close
of the present session some decisive
action may be taken for the correction of bills
which inherit the preseut methods of appoint­
ment, and 1 assure you of my hearty co-opera­
tion in any measures which are likely to con­
duce to that end. As to the most appropriate
term and tenor of the official life of the sub­
ordinate employes of the government, it seems
to be generally agreed that whatever their ex­
tent or character, the one should be definite
and the other 6tablo and that neither should be
regulated by zeal in the service of party or fidel­
ity to the fortunes of an individual.
It matters little to the people at large what
competent person is at the head of this depart­
mentor that bureau, if they feel assured the
removal of and the accession of another will
not involve the retirement of houest and faith
fill subordinates whose duties are purely ad­
ministrative and have no legitimate connec­
tion with the triumph of any political prin.
ciples or the success of any political
party or faction. It is to this latter class of
officers that the senate bill to which we have
already referred exclusively applies. While
neither that bill nor any other prominent
scheme for improving the civil service, concerns
the higher grade of officials who are appointed
by the President and confirmed by the senate,
I feel bound to correct a prevalent misappre
hension as to the frequency with
which the present executive has displaced
the incumbent of an office aud appointed an­
other in his stead. It has been repeatedly al­
leged that he has in this particular signally de
parted from the course which has been pur
sued under recent administrations of the gov
ernment. The facts arc as follows: The
whole number of executive appointments dur
ing the four years immediately preceding Mr.
Garfield's accession to the presidency was
2,696 of this number 244, or 9 per cent., in
volved the removal of previous in
cum bents. The rate of removals to the
whole number of appointments was much the
same during each of those four years. In the
first year, with 790 appointments there were 74
removals, or 9.3 per cent. in the second with
917 appointments there were 85 removals, or 8.5
percent. in the third with 408 appointments
there were 48 removals, or 1 per cent. in the
fourth with 429 appointments there
were 37 removals, or 8.6 per cent
In the four months of President Garfield'
administration there were 390 appointments
and 89 removals, or 22.7 per cent. Precisely
the same number, of removals (89) has taken
place in the fourteen months which have since
elapsed, but they constitute only per cent, of
the whole number of appointments, 1% within
that period and less than one -third of the en­
tire list of officials, 3,459, exclusive of the army
and navy, which is filled by Presidential ap­
pointment
I declare my approval of such legislation as
may bo found nesessary for supplanting the ex­
isting provisions of the law in relation to
political assessments. In July last 1 authorized
a public announcement that employes of the
government should regard themselves as at
liberty to exercise their pleasure in making or
refusing to make political contributions and
that their action in that regard would
in no manner affect their official
status. In this announcement I acted upon
the view which I had always maintained and
still maintain that a publican officer should be
absolutely as free as any other citizen to give or
withhold a contribution for aid of the politics
of his choice. It has however been urged and
doubtless notl without foundation, that
solicitation of superiors and by experiments
such contributions have at times been
obtained from persons whose only
motive for giving has been fear of what might
befall them if they refused. It goes without
saying that such contributions are not volun­
tary: in my judgment, their collection should
be prohibited by law. A bill which will effect­
ually suppress them will receive my cordial ap
proval.
District of Columbia.
I hope that however numerous aud urgent
may be the demands upon your attention the
interests of this district will not be forgotten.
The denial to its residents of the great right of
suffrage in all its relations to national, state
and municipal action, imposes on congress the
duty of affording the best administration which
its wisdom can devise. The report of the dis
trict commissioners indicates certain measures
whose adoption would seem to be very desir
able. I instance in particular those which re
late to the arrears of taxes, to steam railroads
and to assessments of real property.
Presidential Vote.
Among the questions which have been the
topic of recent debate in the halls of congress
none are of greater gravity than those relating
to the ascertainment of the vote for| presiden
ial electiors, and the intendment of the consti­
tution in its provisions for devolving the exe
cntive functions upon the vice president when
the president suffers from inability to dis­
charge the powers and duties of his office,
trust that no embarrassment may result from
a failure to determine these questions before
another national election.
Thanksgiving.
The closing year has been replete with bles­
sings, for which we owe to the Giver of all
good our revereut acknowledgment. For the
uninterrupted harmony of our foreign relations,
for the decay of sectional animosities, for the
exuberauce of our harvests, and the triumphs
of our mining and manufacturing indus
tries, for the prevalence of health, the
spread of intelligence and the conservation
the public credit, for the growth of the coun ti
in all elements of national greatness, for these
and countleiiS other blessings we should rejoice
and be glad. I trust that under the inspiration
of this great prosperity our counsels may be
harmonious and the dictates of prudence,
patriotism, justice and economy may lead tothe

A Double Game.
The newest parlor game at Laramie,
Wyoming Territory, where woman's
suffrage has been established, was in­
vented by the ladies of that region. The
girls sit in one room in a row, with a
chair in front of each one. The yonng
men are stationed in another room and
are brought in one by one. When he
'comes in the youuh chooses his chair
and the young lady behind him blinds
his eyes with a handkerchief. Then the
black cook comes in, kisses him, and
disappears. The youug man is released
feeling much refreshed and elated, and
promptly retires to the other end of the
room. HiB feelings when the next young
tiuur comes in and is treated to this novel
entertainment can be imagined, but they
are mitigated by the pleasure of seeing
the other fellows undergoing the experi­
ment. As a winter evening's amuse
slent it is* one of the most popular in
Wyoming.

GEN. BAUM'S REPORT.
He Advises a Large Reduction in
Taxation.
The Abolition of All Internal Taxes Recont'
mended Except That on Whisky
and Tobacco.
The report of G. B. Ranm, commisson
erof internal revenue, has been submitted
to the secretary of the treasury. It begins
with the topic of reducing taxation as fol­
lows:
The receipts from internal revenue taxation
have increased from $113,000,000 in the fiscal
year of 1879 to $123,000,000 in 1880, $135,000,
000 in 1881, and to §146,500,000 (in round
figures) in the fiscal year last ended. There
will probably be some diminution in receipts
for the present fiscal year as compared with
last year, but it is not likely the collections of
internal revenue for the current year will fall
below $145,000,000, should the taxes now im
posed be retained. It is au old and sound
maxim that no more revenue should be raised
than is neccssary for the economical adminis­
tration of the government and the gradual
reduction of the public debt, although
ixation may be so widely adjusted as not to
operate as a severe burden upon the people.
When the amount collected is beyond the actual
needs of the government there" is presented
constant temptation to extravagance in appro­
priations. Another consideration attending
the overflowing condition of the public treas­
ury cannot have failed to attract your notice.
If the present rate of paying the principal of
the public debt be continued, all bonds subject
to call will be paid within three years, after
which time the government will be compelled,
in order to dispose of
ITS SURPLUS REVENUE,
buy in open market 4)4 Pel' cent, bonds
hich fall due in 1907. Should the government
thus become an active purchaser of these
bonds before maturity, it seems clear they
they would advance iu price to 25 or 30 per
cent, premium to pay which would certainly be
regarded as a waste of the people's money.. It
seems to me a judicious principle that the pub­
lic debt should be extinguished as originally
contemplated only at a rate necessary to meet
the requirements of the sinking fund, viz.: to
the extent of about $55,000,000 per annum.
Therefore, it becomes obvious a reduction of
from 6ixty to seventy millions in the annual
revenues 'of the country could be safely entered
upon and in my judgment such a reduction is
urgently needed, lhe great bulk of the inter­
nal revenue taxation is derived from distilled
spirits, malt liquors, tobacco and cigars. These
are articles of luxury, taxes on which axe really
paid by consumers, and no one need consume
them. I am strongly of the opinion that so
long as the principle' of deriving part of the
revenue of the government from internal taxa­
tion is retained, these articles and dealers
therein, are proper subjects for taxation.
There is no demand on the part of
consumers of these products for remission of
taxes imposed upon them. There is no
IUBI.IC SENTIMENT
calling for their repeal. Other objects of in­
ternal revenue taxation, with amounts realized
therefrom, for the past fiscal year are, friction
matches, $3,272,258 patent" medicines, per­
fumery, etc., $1,978,395 bank checks, %ij,318.
455 bank deposits. $4,077,701: savings bauk
deposits, $88,400 bank capital, $1,138,340: sav­
ings bank capital, $14,729. Add to these items
the taxes collected by the treasurer of the
United States from national hanks, and there is
a total derived from these sources of $18,748,
'223, If to the $18,750,000 reduction thus pro­
posed, congress should add a reduction in
charges for special taxes to dealers in articles
taxed for internal revenue substantially as pro­
posed in a bill now pending before the senate,
a still further diminution of taxation will be at­
tained, and the supervision over dealers in tax­
able articles, which experience has shown to be
necertsary in order to fully and fairly collect
taxes from all alike, be preserved. By
reducing all thene special taxes 40 per
cent., remissions under this head would
be on the basis of last year's collec­
tions—$3,007,905. The act oi March 1,
1879, reduced the tax on tobacco from 24 cents
per pound to 10 cents per pound, but did not
reduce
THE TAX ON CIGARS
and cigarettes. A corresponding reduction on
cigars would be to $4 per thousand. This, I
think, should be done, and would amount to a
reduction of taxes of $6,74(1,100. This would
make a total reduction of internal revenue tax­
es (including taxes on national banks) of $28,
502,128. The tariff revision is considered by
commissions. I venture to suggest whether it
is not desirable to consider the practicability of
taking the duty off sugar. About 2,000,000,
000 pounds of sugar are annually consumed in
the United States, 10 per cent, of which is pro­
duced in this country. Upon the 1,800,000,000
pounds imported the government derives a
revenue of $45,000,000. Should this duty be
removed, there would he not only a certain
and large reduction of revenue, but the benefit
of that reduction would immediately inure to
the people. The bent refined sugar, which now
sells at 10 cents per pound retail, could be sold
at 7 cents, if the duty were removed, and the
total reduction would amount to 90 cents per
capita per annum of the entiro population of
the countiy.
AN OBJECTION TO THIS MEASURE
would be the abolition of the protection now
afforded sugar interests in Louisiana and other
states. This difficulty might be met by giving
a bounty, say 2% cents per pound, upon all
home-produced sugar. The present law gives
sugar planters iu this country, indirectly, $4,
000,000 or $5,000.00 per annum. My proposi­
tion would be to give them this amount directly
and let the whole people have the benefit of the
reduction in taxation of say $45,000,000. which
would in this way be effected. The principle of
paying a bounty for the encouragement aud de­
velopment of American industry was adopted
in the case of fisheries as early as 1813, and
continued for more than fifty years. Millions
were paid out during that time to American
fishermen for fish caught and exported, and we
are still giving this industry a bonus, allowing
them to withdraw salt free of duty and requir­
ing from them no tonnage dues. These re­
ductions, if made, would amount to
$73,502,428. Receipts of internal revenue
taxation for the last two fiscal years:
For 1881, $135,229,913 for 1882, $146,523,273.
Increase, $11,292,361. Receipts for first four
months of the present fiscal year compared
witn the corresponding months of the past fis­
cal year, show an increase in the amount- re­
ceived from special taxes aud a decrease in
distilled spirits an increase in cigars, cheroots,
cigaiettes, snuff of all descriptions and special
tax of dealers in manufactured tobacco, and
A DECREASE IN THE AMOUNT
received from all other taxes on tobacco and
the tobacco trade an increase in the amount
received from special taxes on brewers and
dealers in beer, increase on bank deposits and
bank circulation, and decrease in taxes of every
other character on banks. The entire amount
collected during the fiscal year of 1882 was
promptly covered into the treasury without
loss. During the past six fiscal years 8748,
834,071 have been collected from internal
revenue taxation aud paid into the treasury,
without any less by defalcation. The expenses
of collection for the last six years are about
$27,087,300, or about 8.6 per cent, on the
amount collected. This sum has been dis­
bursed witnout loss to the government. From
October 4. 1877, to June 10 last, the total
number of stamps received was 2,544,344,342,
value $911,180,978 issued 2,381,155,648
value $668,974,374 leaving a balance
on hand June 10, 1882, of 163,188.694 stamps
of the value of $42,206,694.17. The balance of
stamps was counted under the direction of a
special committee, and found correct as to
stamps and value, and agreed to a cent with
the balance shown by the books of this office.
Some monthB ago many leading sweet-mash
distillers made an arrangement for a reduction
of the producing capacity of their distilleries
and for limiting manufacture in their line of
distilled spirits to the demands of trade. They
have recently been followed by the large sour
mash distillers with a somewhat similar ar­
rangement. The effect will be to cut down
production in all classes of distilled spirits to
the demands of trade. On the 30th of June,
1882, spirits remaining in warehouses reached
the highest point, namely, 89.962,645 gallons.
Since that time there has been a gradual reduc­
tion in the amount remaining in warehouses,
and on the 1st of November, 1882, the amount
was 84,628,331 gallons. This large stock main­
ly consists of fine grades of whisky, the tax
upon which will fall due from month to month.
The last withdrawal must be made December
6, 1885.
N THE FUTURE DEMAND
for this class of goods is to be judged of by
withdrawals of similar goods, the tax paid
during the past few years on the stock now on
hand is equal to six yeare consumption. To
postpone payment of the tax on this stock un?
til its withdrawal is required by the demands
of trade, a movement has been set on foot
for its exportation and reimportation and stor­
age in custom fconded warehouses. This is en­
tirely practicable under existing la'WB, and it
becomes a question whether it would not be
better to afford by legislation the relief sought
to be obtained by this indirect means.
EXTENSION OF THE BONDED PERIOD
for a reasonable lime need not impair the se­
curity of the: government for its taxes and
would in no manner tend to reduce the income
of the government from this source of reve­
nue, which has up to this period resulted from
the natural laws of trade and the demand for
distilled spirits. By this means expenses of
transportation both ways and custom house
charges abroad will be saved.
It affords me great pleasure to report the
supremacy of the laws for the_collection of in­
ternal revenue has been established in all parts
of the country. To maintain this favorable
condition of things an I prevent the recurrence
of frauds, it will be necessary to continue the
system of careful policing which has brought
about this result
The recommendation is renewed for granting
pensions to persons disabled while engaged in
enforcing the law and to widows and orphans
of officers killed in the discharge of their duty.
Recommendation is also made that a law be
passed fixing the term of office for collectors of
internal revenue at four years and that collec­
tors will be
SUBJECT TO REMOVAL
except for such cases as are designated in the
law. A repeal is asked of the law which pro­
hibits redemption of stamps unless presented
within three years after purchase from the
government. The recommendation is renewed
for the passage of a law prohibiting the manu­
facture of vinegar by the alcoholic vaporizing
process or subjecting vinegar factories using
the vaporizing process to the supervision of
the government storekeeper, and to other safe­
guards, as in the case of distillers of spirits.
Should it be deemed best to continue the pres­
ent system under suitable safeguards, it might
be well to make such additional provisions as
will permit the manufacturer to fully avail him­
self of the right to condense alcoholic vapor
without be waste of material incident tothe
present process. The compensation of a store­
keeper, if provided, should be reimbursed to
the government by the manufacturer.
THE EXPENSES OF INTERNAL REVENUE
Kei vice for the fiscal vear ending June 30, 188s,
are estimated at $5,274,190. The recommenda­
tions for salaries of collectors for tho fiscal
year ending June 30, 1883, are based upon an
estimate of their probable collections, and
range from a salary of $2,000 for the collec­
tion of $25,000 revenue or less, to $4,000 sal­
ary for the collection of $775,000 revenue.
Tlie total amount of collections from tobacco
for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1882, was
$47,391,988. This amount includes the col­
lections of internal revenue taxes imposed
upon imported manufactured tobacco, snuff
aud cigars (in addition to customs duties),
taxes imposed on domestic manufactured to^
bacco, snuff and cigars, special taxes paid by
manufacturers of tobacco, snuff and cipars,
special taxes paid by dealers iu leaf and deal­
ers in manufactured tobacco, special taxes
paid by peddlers of manufactured tobacco,
and it also includs the receipts of money for
export stamps sold exporters of tobacco. The
condition of the service is all that can bo de­
sired. Reports of inspecting officers show ad­
mirable esprit de corps actuates every officer
in the performance of his duties.
The Attorney General's Report.
WASHINGTON, December 4.—The report of
the attorney general was submitted to con­
gress to-day. fie calls attention to the necef
sity for speedy legislation in the direction of
affording effectual relief from the delays
which now obstruct the administration of jus­
tice in the supreme court and to some f-xient
the circuit and district courts of the United
States. The entire number of t-uits pending
in the court of claims agaii.'st the United
States is 718, claiming $27,591,756.
During the fiscal year 1,973 civil snitB and
7,778 criminal prosecutions were terminated.
Iu the civil suits 999 cases terminated
favorably to the United States and 974
were either nolle prossed, di-missed or discon­
tinued. For the expenses of the courts of the
United States for tho last fiscal year $271,091
were paid, and the amount asked to pay ex­
penses for the next fiscal year is $3,260,000.
This estimate is made up with the view of
avoiding future deficiencies and more promptly
paying public creditors. The attorney general
recommends the revision of the present mar­
shal's fee bill, the increase of the appropriation
enabling the attorney general properly to in­
vestigate the accounts of the district sittorneyV
marshal?, clerks aud other official*, and
the re-enactment of a section provid­
ing that United States attorneys may
appoint substitute attorneys to the duties of
the office when they canuot attend to them
themselves. Other recommendations are as
follows: "That additional legislation be had to
protect executive civil officers of the govern­
ment in their duties and also against outrages
committed upon them because they have faith­
fully performed them. Then- is "no Uuited
States punishment for the murder of one of the
officers while engaged in discharging his
duties, or because he has discharged
them. This is a matter which should
not be left to the administration of justice in
state courts. A proper regard for the safety
of an officer requires that the legislation should
be ample to cover all outrages, but especially
the highest outrage, murder." The building of
United States penitentiaries iu either Arizona
or New Mexico is advocated. The attorney
general calls attention to the refusal of the
legislature of the territory of Utah to appro­
priate funds for the execution of terri­
torial laws under the congressional legislation
and says: "If thin legislation is to be main
tained'special appropriations must therefore be
made annually to meet the demands of justice.
The legislature has been persistent for several
years in this particular and thus has escaped
the charge borne by all other territories. This
amounts to about $26,000 annually." The re­
maining topics referred to in the report pertain
to matters of interest only to residentt of the
District of Columbia.
Napoleon's Weird Sister,
(From Oalignani's (Paris) Messenger.)
One day when Priuce Louis Napoleon
was president of tlie French republic,
an elderly sewing woman, one Angelique
Beltoise," homely, unlettered, silent and
solitary in her habits, and with appar­
ently no thought beyond her daily
drudgery, presented herself before her
employers, her face plowing as if it had
been transfigured. During the night,
she said, she had been visited by a being
radiant with light and beauty, which had
imperiously bidden her rise and write
certain verses from its dictation. "I
obeyed, and here tliey are!" she said,
showing four pages of paper, on wliicb,
in a hand infinitely snperior to her own
scrawl, but yet resembling it, were writ­
ten verses, not up to Hugo's standard,
perhaps, but far beyond her capacity
and education. Her friends endeavored
to ridicule or soothe her out of her be­
lief, but in vain, and she insisted on sell­
ing what few possessions she had in or­
der to have her verses copied and richly
bound. Atter having presented herself
at the Ely see several times, being re­
fused admission, she sent the volume to
the prince-president through the mail.
"When Louis has read it," she said con­
fidently, "he will send for me." Sure
enough, after some time, came a messeD
ger desiring her attendance at the Ely
see. Thither she went and was received
by Mocquard, who questioned her, and
taking her for a crazy woman, declined
fo let her see the prince, but offered her
money. This she declined, only pro­
fessing her anxiety to be informed that
the verses had really reached Louis
Napoleon. This assurance being given,
she said, with satisfaction, "Very well!
Then he knows his future—I can die!'
Nor did she long survive the event. The
verseB contained a prediction that Napo­
leon would become emperor and marry
a foreigner, by whom he would have one
son, and added that the immense power
to which he was to attain would crumble
in a catastrophe as great, which he and
his son were not long to survive.
An Eminent "Old Cove."
Sir James Paget, the eminent English
surgeon,when near his country housere
cently, witnessed a severe accident by
which a man's leg was broken. Sir
James helped the man into his cart and
proceeded to attend to his injuries. The
driver's companion ran to the local doc­
tor and cried out: Please, sir, Bill has
been and fallen out of the cart and got
bis leg broke there's an old cove a-pul
ling of him about, but I can see he ain't
up to much, so I wants you to come at
once, sir, 'cos Bill's very bad." The
doctor hurried to the spot and found that
the old cove" was quite competent to
act in the emergency. Sir James had
made some rough "splints and used a
copy of the London Times to bind up
the leg. Criticism of medical skill as
ofteu happens, came to grief, and Sir
James learned onc« more that fame has
its limitations.
Without An Owner.
There are two blocks of unfinished
brick houses on Sixteenth and French
Streets, Philadelphia, for which no
owner can be found. They are six in
umber, and were begun in 1875 for F.
Williams, but were abandoned after
$12,000 had been expended. Since that
time they have been an eyesore to the
neighborhood, and have been ah en­
larged "playhouse tor all the children
thereabouts." The cellars are partly filled
with stagnant water, decaying carcasses,
and debris of all kinds, and the build­
ings have become a great nuisance.
They have changed owners several times
aud the present owner not being ascer­
tainable, the board of health has or­
dered the owner of the land to remove
them.
