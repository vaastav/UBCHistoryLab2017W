Given Consideration.
Congratulations,
WASrrnfGTON. Dec 6. President Mc
Kinley sent his annual message to con-
fr-ess.
He congratulated it upon assembling under
Yelicilious conditions. Peace and good will with
all nations of tlie earth continue unbroken, he
cays, and we should feel cenuine satisfaction at
ia growing spirit of fraternal regard and uni
fication in all sections of our country and toe
tilting of great public questions above party
prejudice.
The Finances.
Beginning with the subject of the finances,
the president says that while the full eUect of
the legislation of the extra session has not yet
been realized, what it has already accomplished
assures us of its timeliness an.l wis-ioin. To
-test its permanent vaiue further time will be
required and the people, satisiied with its oper
suuds and results thus far. are in no mind to
withhold from it a tair trial. The next ques
tion pressing for consideration is that of the
currency. With the reat risuunrs of govern
ment and with the honorable i xumpie of the
past before us. we ouu'iit not to h"si
tate to enter upon a currency
revision which will make our demand obliga
tions less onerous to the eovernm it. and re
lieve our financial laws from ambi-'Ui y and
ioubU The evil of the present system is
found in the great cost to the government of
maintaining at a parity with gold our dillerenl
forms of money, and tlie exjierience of the past
four years have demonstrated that this is not
only an expensive charge upon the government,
but a dangerous menace to the national
credit. It is manifest that we must devise
some plan to protect the government against
bond issues lor repealed redemptions. We
have Kxju.uuu.Ouu of currency, wnicn the gov
-emment. by solemn enactment, has undertaken
to keep al par. and nobody is ooltged to redeem
la gold but the government, which must borrow
-the gold. The law, which reqi ires the payme.ut
-out of the treasury of redeemed I'nited Males
note, demands a constant replenishment of the
.cold reserve, especially in times of panic and
.insufficient revenue, and during the preceding
Administration 4-&f..'ild,-4Ui 4-,-per-ceuU bonds
were issued and sold to sustain
the gold reserve and pay the esjtenses
of the government in excess of revenue. While
ft Is true that a greater part of this is used to
apply deiicient revenues, a considerable ior
tion was required to maintain the gold reserve.
If no further legislation is to be had. to correct
this and the policy of selling bon is is to be
continued, then cougress should give the sec
retary of the treasury authority to sell bonus
ml long or short periods, beariiur a less rale of
Interest than is now authorized by law. The
resident says:
Keeonrmendations,
"! earnestly recommend as soon as the receipts
the government are quite surlicieut to pay all
the expenses of the government, that when any
United States notes are presumed for redemp
tion In gold ami are p-.i'-eue-d in gold, sucn
notes shall be kept and set ap.irt ami only paid
out in e change for goid. Tuts is an
obvious duty. If the holder of the
United States note prefers the Fold
and gets it from the government
ae should not receive back from the govern
ment a United Slates note wituoul paying goid
in exchange fur it."
That amounts, to the president's mind, to giv
ing an interest be.iring deoi. a government
bfud, for a non-interest oeariug debt, a United
Estates note. The government should be re
lieved from the burden ot providing all the
a-ouf required for exchanges and exports. This
uujrht to be slopped. With an era of prosiTity
and sufficient receipts we may feeino imnutiiaie
embarrassment, but the danger wiii be ever
present.
The president invites careful consideration
or the detail plan of tiie secretary of the treas
ury to protect the gold reserve. He concurs
with bim in the rec ,niiiiendat ion that national
iankH be allowed to issue notes to the face
vaiueof their bonds deposited: that their cir
culation tax be reduced to one-hall of one iier
.cent., and national banks may be established
with a capital of &-.'.Yoiju. Ho also recommends
'that the issue of national bank notes be re
Mricted to the denomination of ten dollars and
upwards and that they be required to redeem
their notes in gold.
The Cuban Question.
Turning to foreign affairs, the president de--votes
much space in his message to a consider--aUon
of the Cu -an question, which he says, is
the most important prolilem with which our
government is now called upon to deal in its
foreign relations. Sumuiari7iug the history of
former outbreaks, the president comes down to
the present insurrection, speaking uf its re
sSiarkabie increase, its t -nacious existence
Against enormous forces massed by Sain the
widespread destruction of property and the
disiegard or the civilized code of
war on both sides. He says these conditions
Hire rise to gravest apprehensions. There is
so desire on our part to prolit by Spain's mis
fortunes, and we have only the desire to see
Cjubans enjoying that measure of self-control,
which is the inalienable right of man. Of the
ooacentration policy of Weyler he says: "It
tins utterly failed as a war measure, it is not
tfuvilized warfare it is extermination."
Our Government's I'rotest.
.Against this abuse of the rights of war. ths
president says, he has felt constrained, on re
peated uccasious to enter the lirm and honest
protest of this government. He outlines his
instructions to Minister Woodford, which were
in substance to impress upon ttic Spanish gov
ernment the sincere wish of the United Slates
to lend its aid toward the ending of the war by
reaching a )ieac ful and lasting result, just anil
3ouorablc to Spain and to the t'uban people.
It was also asked whether Spain of her own
volition should not make profiosals for settle
ment and it was said thai we could not contem
plate an IlideUuite jieriod lor the accompiish--snent
of this result.
The Spanish Reply,
The Spanish reply to Mr. Woodford, was, in
v.he president's opinion, in the direction of a
better understanding. It admitted our friendly
purposes and deep interest, aud declared that
the new government was bound to change of
policy that should satisfy the United Slatesand
pacify Cuba within a reasonable time. To this
end political reforms will be put into effect and
onilitary operutious conducted on humane
lines. It was suggesU-d that Spain be
left free to conduct military operations
and grunt political reforms wnile the
United States for its part should enforce neu
tral obligations and cut on the assistance
-which the insurgents, it was asserted, received
Trom this country. Karly and complete paciii-
cation is hoped for.
The president declares that the Spanish dis
. position to charge us with failure to meet in
ternational duties is baseless, and points to
the efforts this government have made at the
. cost of minions, and by the employment of the
- administrative machinery of the nation to per
form its duty welt He also says that the fact
that no military expedition or armed vessel
-,as left our shores has been diplomatically
t represented with Spain. Promising that
throughout all the horror and danger to our
1 peace, the United States has never abrogated
uts right to determine its policy as to Cuba, the
president points out that, of untried measures,
there remains only: Kecogniiion of the insur
gents as belligerents, recognition of the inde
pendence of Cuba, neutral intervention to end
the war by imposing a rational compromise be
tween the contestants, an intervention in favor
X3t one or the other party.
Mo Forcible Annexation.
"He says: "I speak not ot forcible annexa
tion, for that can not be thought of. That by
air code of morality would be criminal aggres
sion. Taking up the question of belligerency,
cv president quotes at length from President
Ofraut's message of December 7, !.. wherein
as declared that the condition in Cuba war
raated neither the recognition of independence
nor the reeomiiion of belligerency. He adds
aal moreover a recognition of bellig
erency would confer upon Neither
party to conflict a status not there'ofore act
ually possessed while it would weUiu heavily
In Spain's behalf, giving her the right to search
a the hi h seas and extending her maritime
rathts to the margin of our territorial waters,
'or these reasons," says the president, "I
regard the recognition of the belligerency of
the Cuban insurgents as now unwise and there
fore inadmissible. Should that step hereafter
be deemed wise, as a matter of right and duty,
he executive will take it."
Hopeful Citange In Spanish Pollry.
He points U the hopeful change In the Span
ish policy to the pledge of reform and to the
abatement of the horrors of war as reasons
against intervention on humanitarian grounds.
The lirst acts of the new government lie iu ihe
honorable paths it has outlined: the policy of
Tvpine and extermination has been reversed
aad broad clemencies proffered: measures have,
been taken to relieve the horrors of starvatio n
Thepoetct the Spanish aimies. it is as
aerted. is to be used not to spread ruin and des
ctatioa. but to protect the resumption of agri
cultural industries. The president sketches
hc autonomy scheme of the Spanish govern
ment, and says that it is honestly due to Sp-cin
cast aha should be given a reasonaie chance to
realize her expectations, a id to prove the as
serted efliciacy of the new order of things to
which she stands irrevocably committed. He
points to the manv con'-essions already made,
to the modifications of the horrible order of
concentration, to the release of the Com
petitor" prisoners, und the fact that not a
single Amencan citizen is now under
arrest in Cuba. He says the n-ar future will
demonstrate whether a righteous peace is likely
t be attained, if not. the exigency of further
and other action by the United States will re
main to be taken. Sure of the right, the gov
ernment will continue its watchful cares over
every American citizen and its efforts
to brm? about honorable peace and,
says the President: "IZ it snail h ace
after appear to be a duty imposed
by our obligations to ourselves, to civilization
and humanity to intervene with force, it shall
lie w Uhout fuuit fn our part, and only because
the necessity for sueh action will be so clear as
toco umatid the supiort and approval of the
civilized world."
Hawaiian Annexation.
The president next takes up the subject of
the annexaio;i of Hawaii which, he says, should
be accomplished, liapioly reviewing his former
argum"tiis in facnr ot annexation, he says that
legislation is rci-ired in the event of the ratitl
caiion of the treaty and. whiie abrupt assimila
tions of immature i- nientsof population should
be avoided, just provision should be mane for
self-rule in local miners with tue largest po
litical iilierlyto the Jl.w.-aiians.
HesaysTuat Ine dispute between Japan and
Hawaii over the itiiuiie-ation question is now
in a sat i -factory stageol :,cKiemetit dy negotia
tions; that our government has not intervened,
an I that it is learned that Japan is now con
lidctit in the intention of this government to
dea. with ail possible uitcruir questions alTect
ing her interests in the broadest spirit ol
friendliness.
Ontral American Complexities.
Keference is made to the failure of Mr. Mer
ry to be received as minister to Nicaragua on
account of the otil;eatii,ns of that country to
the diet of the liiva'cr liepubiic of Central
Ame ica. As there is uo lega. authority at
present to accredit him to Ire- diet. -Mr. li.iker,
the present minister a- Managua, has been di
rected to present his letter., of recall. Air. W.
tlodfrey hunter is sai l to be likewise accred
ited to Honduras, a member of the Greater lie
pubiic, and his case is awaiting action.
The Nu-araguit Canal.
The Nicaragua canal is spoken of as of large
importance to our country, and the promise is
made of further reference to the subject which,
in the report of tiie commission now at work,
is sent to congress.
International lll-Metalliftm.
The president says of the international mon
etary commission that, notwithstanding dil
igent etiort, the envoys have failed
so far to secure an agreement. Gratifica
tion is expressed at the action of France
in this matter in joining in our ciiects, and it is
said that the negt.a.aiiotis are still pending.
Meanwhile the envoys have not made their
linal reports, believing lhat ttiedouMs raised in
certain quarters re,ieciin the feasibility of
maintaining parity between goldand silver may
yet be solved, 'i'lie president earnestly hopes
that theii labors may br. n ubuu'. au interna
tional agreement.
Ket-iproeity Negotiation.
Mr. Kass-.n. of Iowa, is said to be now con
ducting ne'nti.itior:s with several governments
lor reciprocity arrangements u.ttier the tanil
act. and it is believed i uat oy a careful exercise
of the powers conferred by l!i" ael. some griev
ances of our owu and oiaer countries in our
mutual trade relations may be removed or alle
viated and Hit volume oi our commercial ex
changes enlarged.
The president earnestly urges the improve
ment of our merchant marine, the Inferiority of
which, he says, is humiiiaiin to tnu national
pride.
Protection of Seal Life.
Keference is made to the recent conferences
at Washington on the subject of toe protect.on
of seai iile. the results 01 uhicli place beyond
conlrovcrsy. it is said, ol the duty of the gov-ci-niiieiils
concerned to adopt measures without
delay for tile preservation of the herds. Nego
l.auous to this end are now in progress.
International Arbitration.
International arbitration is declared by the
president to represent the lu st seitnm- iit ol the
civilize 1 world, and treaties cmh.idyiiig these
humane, principles on broad lines, 'without in
any way lmeeriiiingour interests or honor, will
have its constant eucouragemenL

which the peop.e have shown au unprecedented
interest.
The Navy.
Under the head of the navy, the president
points to the necessity for speedy legislation
to procure the armor for the three battleships
now building, which would be otherwise use
less. He sp-aks iu terms of praise of tne qual
ity of our ships, aud thinks that the time has
now arrived when the increase to which the
country is committed should for a time take
the form of increased facilities commensurate
with the increase of our naval vessels
Luck of Dock I'acil.tles.
He refers to Ihe lack of docks, and urges that
three or four of the largest docks be provided
on the Atlantic, at least one on the Pacific
coast, and a floating din-k in the gulf. There
should also be ample provision for munitions
of war and an increase of oincers and enlisted
men. Additions are also necessary to navy
yards, and as there are now on the stocks live
large battleships it is recommended that an
appropriation tie made but for one more battle
ship on the Pacific coast. Several torpedo
boats are also necessary.
Legislation Needed for AlBMka.
Attention is called to the need for prompt
legislation as to Alaska and the extensj-jr, of
civil authority wituiu the tefriiory. Tuere is
need for surveys an. I for the citabiishment of
anoi her land utile- al some point in the Yukon
valley, for which an appropriation is ask4d.
Military force is also necessary aud the estab
lishment of some sort of flexible government.
If the startling rep irts as to the probable
shortage of food for the miners be fully vert
tied, ev. ry etiort should be made at any cost to
carry them relief.
Affairs in I lie Indian Territory.
The message deals at some length with the
unsatisfactory condition of adairs in the Indian
territory. 'I he large wnile eleni'-ut is said to be
without protection and without schools or oth
er rights of citizens: leading Indians have ab
sorbed great tracts of lanus and created an
aristocracy, and the friends of ine Indians be
lieve that ihe iH'st interests of the live civilized
tribes would be found in American citizenship.
Failure of the Dawes Commission.
Keference is made to the failure so far of the
Dawes commission to secure the consent of ths
trities to an extinguishment of the tribal titles
aud a division ot the lands. It is said that
should the tribes still fail to ratify the agree
ment, that some legislation should be had by
congress.
The Quarantine Laws.
The president approves the rccommeu . At ion
of the secretary of the treasury for an .(ten
sion of the quarantine laws, and also surest
the appointment of a special commission io as
certain the caa of yellow fever.
Tlie Khiihmh I'Mcitlc Kailrond.
Speaking of th? pending sale of the fc ansas
Paeilic railroad, it is said, that if no belter
bidder is received than the upset price UxeJ by
the court, the government would receii only
R'.nilu.ouO on its claim of nearly I3.0 u.oou. He
believes that the government has the authority
to bid oa the road, and has directed the secre
tary of the treasury to make tne deposit of
Ijih.Oui required to qualify as a bidder and to
bid at the sale a sum at least equal to the prin
cipal of the debt to the government.
Congress Should Legislate In th Case,
He suggests, however, that in a matter so im
portant as the government becoming a possible
owner of the railroad, congress should enact
some legislation to define its views. It is clear
to him. however, that the government should
not permit the property to be sold at a price
less than one half the principal of its debt and
less than one-fifth of its enure debt, principal
and interest.
The Civil Service.
The president devotes the last chapter of his
message to i he civil service, the practical im
provement of which, he says, has long been a
subject of earnest discussion, and which has of
late years received increased legislative and ex
ecutive approval. During the past few months
the service has been placed upon a still
firmer basis of business met ho is
and personal merit. While the
right of deserving veteran soldiers
to reinstatement has biien asserted, dismissals
for merely political reaWins have been carefully
guarded against: the examinations improved
and made practical, and a distinct advance
has been made by iving a hearing befort dis
missal upon all cases where Incompetency is
charged or demand made for the removal of
officials. This last has been done with
out impairing the power of re
moval, one of the vital safeguards
of the system. Much remains to be done be
fore the system can lie perfected, and the pres
ident says that be shall not hesitate to exempt
rases which he thinks have been improperly
Included in the classified service, or include
those wmch. in his judgment, will best 1 promote
the public service The system has the ap
proval of the people, and it will bo his endeavor
to uphold and extend iu
Retrenchment Suggested.
In conclusion, the president admonishes 004
gress not to encourage the increase of the esti
mates for the maintenance of the government.
They would admilof decrease in many braneres
and it is a commanding duty to keep the aopto
priations within the receipts of the govern
uasntl and thus avoid a deficit.

tion purposes, and also all si.'ver

that banks be allowed to deposit as se
curity with the treasury, greenbacks,
treasury notes, or silver certificates to
a total amount of S-UO.OOO.OOO against
which national bank notes shall be
issued to them to an equal amount. He
ulso recommends that the guaranty

THE CLAYTON MURDER.
Intermit Revived In the Alleged Georgia
Clew Corroborative Evidence la at
Hand The Slurderer l.elleved to be a
Convict Now Serving a Life Sentence la
the Georgia feniirntlary for Another
Murder.
Little Rock. Ark., Dec. a. Interest
In the Pitts (Ga.) clew to the murderer
ot Hon. John M. Clayton, which had
about subsided here, owing to tiie tone
ot recent communications from Luther
Aiken, the Georgia convict guard, who
claims to be in possession of the name
of the murderer, has been revived, and
it is now probable that the clew will
be investigated.
Sheriff J. D. Clary of Bradley coun
ty. Ark., in an interview with Gov.
Jones, has related strong corroborative
evidence of the alleged fact that a
Ueorgia convict has confessed to the
murder of Clayton at Plummerville iu
the autumn of 1SS9. Sheriff Clary says
that he has information from a former
citizen of Georgia, now living in Brad
ley county, that a Georgia convict made
such a confession to another convict,
and that the self-confessed murderer of
John M. Clayton is now serving a
life sentence for another murder in
Georgia. His name is withheld, but it
is stated that he is a former citizen of
Arkansas aud fled from the state im
mediately after murdering Clayton.
At the time the murder was committed
it was generally considered to be the
denoument of a political fight, but, ac
cording to the confession, politics
played no part in the terrible affair,
revenge for an old grudge being the
motive given by the Georgia convict.
The state authorities say they will
leave no stone unturned to bring the
murderer to justice in this state, bat
are in a quandary as to how it could
be done, should the murderer be found
serving a life sentence for murder in
another state. The state of Arkansas
has a reward of only S5U0 standing at
present for the arrest and conviction
of the murderer, but it is thought that
the relatives of the murdered man will
supplement the amount to the end
that the Georgia clew may be thor
oughly investigated.

A NECKLACE OF PEARLS
Is a beautiful possession. If a woman

she makes haste to find and restore it.
Good health is a more valuable possession
than a necklace of the most beautiful pearls,
yet one by one the jewels of health slip away,
and women seem indifferent until it is
too late, and they cannot be restored.
To die before yon are really old is to suffer
premature death, and that is a sin. It is a sin
because it is the result of repeated violations
of nature's laws.
Pain, lassitude and weariness, inability to
sleep, dreadful dreams, starting violently from

Yon cannot have nerve trouble and keep
