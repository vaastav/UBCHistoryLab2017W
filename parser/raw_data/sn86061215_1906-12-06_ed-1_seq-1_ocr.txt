MESSAGE CAUSES STIR
Various Intepretatlons Upon Words of
President Adds Chaos-—Seeming
Threat to Use the Army And Navy
to Enforce the Law.
San Francisco, Dec. 5.—Under direct
orders from •Washington representa
tives of the department of justice in
California have been instructed to be
gin action in the courts to test the
legality of the state statute which pro
vides that children of Mongolian des
cent shall attend a separate school.
When the attention of President All
man of the board of education was
called to that portion of the Presi
dent's message he said the utterances
of the President on the Japanese ques
tion would have no effect on the action
of the board.
Creates Sensation.
Washington,' D. C., Dec. 5.—Presi
dent Roosevelt's reference in his presi
dential message to congress to the seri
ous aspect of the Japanese question in
California created a decided sensation
in congress. The various interprets
tions upon the meaning and intent of
the message added to the chaos which
the seeming threat to use the army and
navy against the Californians to en
force the treaty rights of the Japanese,
created.
The California members of congress
understand the President to say that
there is now no lav to punish per
sons guilty of depriving foreigners* in
the United States of their treaty
rights that the United States is, how
ever, responsible to foreign govern
ments for such violation of rights
that, Inasmuch as the federal govern
ment is, responsible for the conse
quences, it, should have the power to
prevent violations of treaty rights and
that, as far as possible under existing
law, the President proposes to see that
the treaty rights of the Japanese are
respected.
Question of State's Rights.
Caiifomians interpret the message to
mean that the President proposes to
test the right of the state of Califor
nia to resist the administration's con
struction of the California law and the
Japanese treaty and that he will' use
... his position to restrain the Japanese
pending a court decision. On the other
hand he will deal with any overt- act
against the Japanese in California with
an iron hand pending the same deci
sion.
Senator Perkins declared that he
agresd with the message in the ab
stract, but as. applied to the Califor
nia case It did an injustice. He de
nied the violation of any treaty rights
of the Japanese.

EMMA RIPKE TELLS STORY
Giri Says She Heard Potts Say He
Deserved to Die.
^yjCouncil Bluffs, Dec. 5.—For three
hours yesterday Emma Ripke, on trial
for the murder of Frank Potts, was
on the witness stand. In explanation
of the conflicting stories she told im
mediately after Potts' death, she said
she was confused and did not know
what she was doing. Asked to relate
the circumstances of the case she said
in substance that Potts returned home
late, drunk. He retired and she again
fell asleep. She said she was aroused
by a sharp noise causing her to leap
from the bed. Potts then said he had
shot himself, and that he deserved to
die. She still did not believe he had
been shot and called a physician who
told her that Potts had Suffered from
an attack of heart failure. She said
she was as much surprised as anyone
when learning the next day that a bul
let had been found in his heart. She
made a good witness and was little
confused on cross examination.

Herkimer, N. Y., Dec. 5.—The jury
in the trial of Chester E. Gillette for
tl'e murder of his sweetheart, Grace
Brown, at Big Moose lake, on July 11,
last, last night returned a verdict of
guilty in the first degree.
Sentence will be pronounced on
Thursday morning to which time court

Former Senator MillB, Gillette's coun

that when court reconvened at 10

Court Room Was Crowded.
Every aeat end every bit of space
where xtanaing room could be secii'fd
in the court room remained filled
fiuring the five hours of the jury's de
liberations. Many expressed their de
termination to remain until morning
should a verrllot not be returned lasl
night. The buzz of conversation was
continuous as people (Hscmsed the
phases of the case. Now and then
tlitre was a stir as rumor spread that
a verdict nad oeesi reached and every
movement in the direction of the jury
room was watched with intense eager
ness.
Every eye was fixed on Gillette, who
was evidently nervous when he enter
ed the room, accompanied by Under
Sheriff Klock, and the crimson flush
that- had remained on his cheeks all
day, during the merciless speech of
the prosecutor, had faded Into a death
ly palor. He was chewing gum and
his fingers twitched nervously as he
took a chair.
Heard Sentence Stoically.
When the foreman made the an
nouncement that the jury found the
defendant guilty as charged in the in
dictment, Gillette was sitting corner
wise in his^ chair. His legs were cross
ed, his favorite attitude during the
trial. As the words that were destined
to tend "him to the death chair, were
spoken, there was not a sign of change
in the prisoner. Not a quiver showed
that he had heard them. His features
were set and his face was colorless.
His expression was vacant and he ut
tered no sound.
At the request of Gillette's counsel
the Jury was polled.
Gillette set motionless and as one
after another the twelve jurors aroso
to their feet and declared that they
were united in their decision.

When the twelfth man had respond

Bill Introduced Providing For Prohlbi-

Are Employed.
Washington, D. C., Dec. 5.—Congress
man Ames of Massachusetts has begun
a propaganda for an immediate move
ment in the interest of tariff revision.
He says he is not undertaking to se
cure action at the present session of
congress, but is urging upon the repub
lican members the advisability of a
general caucus to "give concrete ex
pression of their determination to im
mediately revise the inequalities pres
ent in our tariff laws so all possible no
tice of the country may be given as
to the time of revision."
To Prevent Child Labor.
Senator Lodge today introduced a

cannot read and write.

After a debate the senate postponed

Asks Additional Power.
The President today sent a special
message to congress urging legisla
tion giving the executive authority
upon his own initiative and responsi
bility to dismiss any officer whom he
thinks unworthy to remain in the ser
vice. The law at present provides that
in time of peace no officer shall be
dismissed except in pursuance of court
martial or in mitigation thereof.
It is not improbable that the legis
lative appropriation bill which now is
being prepared by the house commit
tees on appropriations and which soon
will be reported, will contain a provi
sion increasing the salaries of mem
bers of the house from $5,000 a year
to 17.500.
Such a provision doubtless would be
subject to a point of order as new leg
islation, under the rules of the house,
but it is said there is a tacit under
standing that the point shall not be
raised.
In view of the increase it is probable
that there will be coupled with it a
proposition to pay members only their
actual traveling expenses in lieu of the
5 cents per mile which they now are
allowed.
JURIST FEARS POVERTY DIES
B. F. Webber of Minnesota^ Commits
Suicide by Hanging.
New Ulm, Minn., Dec. 5.—Former
Judge B. F. Webber, considered one
of-the most brilliant men at the Min- lican defeated
nesota bar, committed suicide yester
day by hanging. Fear of the poor
house, although his wealth was esti
mated at $100,000, drove the jurist to
take his life. Large medical bills for
the treatment of his wife, who has
been a paralytic for years, led the for
mer judge to believe that his accumu
lation of years of arduous work on
bench and at the bar would be dissi
pated shortly.
Mr. Webber was to have been the
guest of honor at a banquet Friday
night, tendered him by the Brown
County Bar association, in honor of
his long service on the woolsack,from
which he resigned only a few weeks
ago. Leading attorneys from all parts
of Minnesota were to have been pres-.
ent. ...

maintains his innocence. The testi
mony of witnesses who apeared before
the coroner's Inquest is being present

mony by physicians will be presented

Sixth District Congressman Makes the
Statement in the Presence of Sena
tor Dolliver—Does Not Want the
Land Office Job.
Cedar Rapids, Dec. 5.—The Gazette's
Washington correspondent says
Congressman Lacey caused a real
ture. Ho Is'going to return to Iowa,
resume tha practice, of law at Oska
loosa and two years hence run for sen
ator. Asked If he would again be a
candidate for congress in the sixth dis
trict, the major said:
"I'll be a candidate again, but not
for congress. I'll run for the senate
two years from now."
"But what do you mean—how do
you figure It out?" was asked.
"Senator Allison will not be a can
didate again he is 76 years old. Two
years hence we will have a popular
primary in Iowa they are going to
adopt this winter. Why shouldn't I run
for senator Under it
"No reason at all it's ju3t a matter
of getting the votes."
"Well, I'm going to take some little
part in politics In Iowa from this time
on and it will no^ be a joke—my run
ning for the senate."
The major's announcement was
made in conversation with your cor
respondent, Senator Dolliver being
present. It waB apparent that it was
made In all seriousness. Previous to
these statements he had said that he
would not ask or want the commis
sionership of the general land office, for
whicn he has been considered the most
likely candidate.
Does Not Want Land Office.
"I can earn more money practicing
law," he said, "and anyhow It would
not oe any satisfaction to ine to be at
the head of a bureau. I would rather
like to be secretary of the interior, but
head of the general land office is quite
another thing. These thieves who are
after the public lands would be calling
me names in no time, and there would
not be time enough to reform the
thing. No, I don't want the place."
Major Lacey, as the only Iowa repub
this year, is bitter
against Governor Cummins, and, his
friends say, believes he could beat the
governor in a race for the senatorial
nomination under popular primaries.
At any rate, there is not much room
for doubt that he intends to try for it,
and doubtless he has reason to think
he will have the general stand pat sup
port.
"And the democrats won't vote in
this primary, either," added the major.

Cereal Mill—Sells for Committeeman
Des Moines, Dec. 5.—An effort will
be made In the coming session of the
legislature to extend the present' law
giving the auditor of state the power
to examine the accounts of cities of
more than 5,000 population and of such
other cities as petition him to do so.
to cover county finances also.
It Is probable that the law will be
strengthened, also, with respect to
what shall be done when, evils are
found In municipal accounts. At pres
ent there Is nothing to be done. The
inspectors working for the auditor of
state make a report on the condition
of finances of the city whose accounts
they examine and file the same at the
state house. That is the end. If
there are glaring evils the publicity
is the only remedy.
Up to date the auditor's inspectors
have examined the accounts of the
following cities:
Keokuk, Atlantic, Fort Madison,
Creston, Marshalltown and Mt. Pleas
ant.
George E. Pennell of Atlantic, who
Is in charge of the work, will go to
Oelweln next.
Aided Cereal Mill.
He said here today that he had found
nothing specially sensational in any of
the cities whose, accounts he had ex
amined, so far. At Keokuk he found
certain warrants outstanding repres
enting money advanced to aid a cereal
mill and factory. This he vigorously
criticised and in turn was assailed by
the local press at Keokuk. The theory
now is held that there should be some
means of enforcing recommendations
relative to evils of this character. The
law which requires all cities to adopt
a uiliform system of accounting, in ac
cordance with a plan adopted by the
state board, goes into effect April 1.
After that, in all probability, some
thing can be done to effect the reme
dies which the inspectors recommend.
At any rate there will be wide public
ity of the condition of the cities, as
the auditor of state will issue reports
thereon.
Looks Like Sells.
In view of the New York dispatches
outlining a combination between
Chairman Taggart of the national
democratic committee and Mr. Bryan,
Iowa democrats fully expect to hear
the announcement of the appointment
of Cato Sells as Iowa committeeman
within a few weeks. The New York
dispatches state that Mr. Taggart is
profoundly convinced that Mr. Bryan
should be the nominee for president in
1908, that he Is anxious to retain his
present' place as chairman of the na
tional committee, that a combination
of the majority of the national com
mittee with Mr. Bryan is an extreme
ly desirable thing for the committee
interested and that Iowa is one of the
states which Mr. Bryan is expected to
control without help from his friends
on the national committee. Under
these circumstances t*ie appointment
of Mr. Sells, representative of the
democracy of Iowa in favor of Mr.
Bryan, is expected soon.
The New York dispatch says
"With the sanction and support of
William J. Bryan, he is working to
win over the members of the national
committee and with Mr. Bryan, control
the national convention."
Iowa Bryan democrats think that
this settles the controversy in this
stat^ In f^vor of Mr. Sells.
