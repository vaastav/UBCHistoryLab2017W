THE PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE.
We publish elsewhere in to
day's paper a complete summary
of President Roosevelt's message
to Congress this week, the' pe
ru>al of which our readers will
find much more satisfactory than
wading through the voluminous
decussent itself ooo?i*o
unu.-ually lengthy, containing
over twenty-five thousand words,
and its reading in Congress consumed
two and one-half hours.
The paper is characteristic of
Roosevelt?able, scholarly and
interesting. However much one
may differ with the President in
the views and opinions expressed
by him, the conclusion is irresistible
that he handles his subjects
with consummate skill and
ability, to say nothing ol the
relreshing degree ot candor that
pervades his writings.
Ot the various matters consid
ered by the President probably
what he says about lynching
will prove ot greatest interest to
the South just now, since the
subject necessarily includes a
very important feature ol the
negro problem. W.1 ile deprecating
the prevalence ol mob violence,
the President admits thai
lynching is not peculiar to any
particular section?that it occurs
"now in one part ol the country,
now in another." As to the cause
of lynching ho truly says:
"A great many white men
lynched, but the crime is
Jiariy Irequent in respect to
.men. Tiie greatest exist
*e ol lynching is the perespecially
by black
*,he hideous crime of
imost abominable in
gory of crimes, even
. murder."
nouncing the cruel
_. i ^

of fhe mob are some.
tured. the President
Mie tendency ol lynchrape
as follows :
ness grows by what
^on; and when mobs
lynch lor rape they
' extend the sphere ol
operations and lynch lor
V. /nany other kinds of crimes, so
that two-thirds ol the lynchings
are not for rape at all; while a
considerable proportion of the
individuals lynched are innocent
of all crime.''
The President's idea as to the
duty of the negro in the mat1
ot suppressing rape and as
how the crime should be punii
cu JO UA|'IC33CU UJ u 1 ill ao I
lows:
"Every colored man shou
realize that tiie worst iy
his race is the negro niu
! and. above all the neg. ait
who commits the dreadiul cm
ol rape ; and it sliould^be felt
in the highest degree an oiler
against the whole country, a
against the colored race in p
ticular, for a colored man to f
to help the officers of the law
hunting down with a'1 pcssil
earnestness and zeal every sn
infamous offender. Moreover,
my judgment, ihe crime of ra
should always be punished wi
death, as is the case with murd
assault with intent to comn
tape should be made a capi
crime, at least in the discreti
? f the court; and provisi
should be made by which t
punishment mav follow imn
diately upon the heels of i
offense; while the trial should
so conducted that the vict
need not he wantonly shan:
while giving testimony, n
that the loast possible public
diall he given to the details.'
That is certainly good adv
to the colored man, and it is
he hoped that ho will heed
The President is also right ab(
the punishment of the rapi
The penalty should not only
death, but it should "follow i
mediately upon the heels ol I
offense." The President is rigl

In Memoriam.
A good woman has gone
her rest in Heaven. God in I
infinite wisdom on November
1906, sent His messenger ii
the home of Mr. 1, T. Hunt
i
i and claimed the sweet spirit
I his dear wife, Mrs. Ella Hun
who for many years has been I
encouraging and consolingldo
this good man, as well as
central lightol this highly cult
ed christian home.
It is difficult to estimate 1
intluence of such a lite us he
though dead, yet she speaks, t
will speak until the end ot tii
When the end came she mel
like a christian soldier, with g?
; hope in Christ.
And we know beyond this v
of teal's there is a life abo
where all sorrow shall cease, f
we shall res' in love.
She will he greatly miss
in i lie church, town, and comn
nity, but we bow in humble s
mission to the will of Him \>
doeth all tilings well.
Iler living would be the gri
tying and consoling ot husbai
children, relatives and Irien
but to die is her eternal gain.
When we stand by, and
such a precious jewel as this tal
from our midst, we can only
| claim as l'aul|did : O dea
| where is thy sting? 0 gra
wnere is my victory r nut thai
bo to God, the victory is
us through our Lord Je
Christ.
In my fancy, 1 can hear
lonely daughter say,
; O mother, mother1'dear,
Mow can I live without thee here?
But in a gentle tone of love, I h
mother say,
Grieve not my child, chase all
fears away.
