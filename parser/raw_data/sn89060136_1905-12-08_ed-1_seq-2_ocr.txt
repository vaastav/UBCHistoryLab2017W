to Congress
m NATION IS PROSPEROUS
- -
Btrong Official Recommendation* and
Questions That will Demand the
Attention of Congress—Mr. Roose
velt’s Views on Needed Legislation.
The following is a general synop
sis of the annual message of Presi
dent Roosevelt, read at opening of
Congress:
Introduction.
To the Senate and House of Repre
sentatives :
The people of this country continue
to enjoy great prosperity. Undoubt
edly there will be ebb and flow in
such prosperity, and this ebb and flow
will be felt more or less by all mem
bers of the community, both by the
deserving and the undeserving.
Against the wrath of the Lord the wis
dom of man can not avail; in times
of flood or drouth human ingenuity
can but partially repair the disaster.
A general failure of crops would hurt
us. Again, if the folly of man mars
the general well-being, then those who
are innocent of the folly will have to
pay part of the penalty incurred by
those who are guilty of the folly. A
panic brought on by the speculative
folly of part of the business com
munity would hurt the whole business
community. But such stoppage of
welfare, though it might be severe,
would not be lasting. In the long
run the one vital factor in the per
manent prosperity of the country is
the high individual character of the
average American worker, the aver
age American citizen, no matter
whether his work be mental or man
ual, whether he be fanner or wage
worker, business man or professional
man.
In our industrial and social system
the interests of all men are so closely
intertwined that in the immense ma
jority of cases a straight-dealing man
who by his efficency, by his ingenu
ity and industry, benefits himself
must also benefit others.
Thus the average producer, the
man of small means, and the aver
age consumer, as well as the average
produce, are all alike helped by
making conditions such that the man
of exceptional business ability re
ceives an exceptional reward for
his ability. Something can be done
by legislation to help the general pros
perity; but no such help of a perman
ently beneficial character can be given
to the less able and less fortunate,
save as the results of a policy which
shall inure to the advantage of all in
dustrious and efticent people who act
decently; and this is only another
way of saying that any benefit which
comes to the less able and less for
tunate must of necessity come even
more to the more able and more for
tunate. If, therefore, the less for
tunate man is moved by envy of his
more fortunate brother to strike at
the conditions under which they have
both, though unepually, prospered, the
result will assuredly be that while
damage may come to the one struck
at it will visit with an even heavier
load the one who strikes the blow.
Taken as a whole we must all go up or
go down together.
Corporations.
Yet, while not merely admitting,
but insisting upon this, it is also true
that where there is no governmental
restrait or supervision some of the ex
ceptional men use their energies nol
in ways that are for the common
good, but in ways which tell againsl
this common good. The fortunes
amassed through corporate organiza
tion are now so large, and vest such
power in those that weild them, as
to make it a matter of necessity to
give to the soverign—that is, to the
Government, which represents the
people as a whole —some effective
power of supervision over their cor
porate use. In order to insure a heal
thy social and industrial life, every
big corporation should be held respon
sible by, and be accountable to some
soverign strong enough to control its
conduct.
I am in no sense hostile to corpor
ations. This is an age of combination,
and any effort to prevent all combi
nation will be not only useless,* but
in the end vicious, because of the
contempt for law which the failure to
enforce law invariably produces. We
should, moreover, recognize in cordial
and ample fashion the immense good
effected by corporate agencies in a
country such as ours, and the wealth
of intellect, energy, and fidelity devot
ed to their service, and therefore nor
mally to the service of the piibiic, by
their officers and directors. The •
corporation has come to stay, just as
the trade union has come to stay.
Each can do and has done great good,
each should be favored so long as it
does good but each should be shirply
checked where it acts against law anti
justice. So long as the tinances of
the Nation are kept upon an honest
basis no other question of internal
economy with which the Congress
has the power to deal Itegins to ap
proach in importance the matter of
endeavoring to secure proper indus
trial conditions under which the indi
viduals—and especially the groat cor
porations—doing an interstate busi
ness are to act. The first thing to
do is to deal with the grent corps-ra
tions engaged in the business of iner
state transportation.
The first consideration to be kept
in mind is that the power should
be affirmative and should be giveD
to some administrative body creat
ed by the Congress.
All private-car lines, industrial
roads, refrigerator charges, and the
like should be expressly put under
the supervision of the Interstate Com
merce Commission or some similar
body so far as rates and agreements
practically affecting rates, are con
cerned.
Safety Appliances.
In my annual Message to the Fifty
eighth Congress, at its third session,
I called atention to the necessity for
legislation requiring the use of block
signals upon railroads engaged in
interstate commerce. The number of
serious collisions upon unblocked
roads that have occurred within the
past year adds force to the recom
mendation then made.
Hours of Labor of Railroad Em
ployees.
The excessive hours of labor to
which railroad employees in train ser
vice are in may cases subjected is
also a matter winch may well engage
the serious attention of the Con
gress. The strain, both mental and
physical, upon those who are engaged
in the movement and operation of
railroad trains under modern condi
tions is perhaps greater than that
which exists in any other industry,
and if there are any reasons for limit
ing by law the hours of labor in any
employment, they certainly apply with
peculiar force to the employment of
those upon whose vigilance and alert
ness in the performance of their du
ties the safety of all who travel by
rail depends.
The Revenues.
There is more need of stability
than of the attempt to attain an ideal
perfection in the methods of raising
revenue; and the shock and strain
to the business world certain to at
tend any serious change in these
methods rendering such change inad
visable unless for grave reason.
But in time of peace the revenue
must on the average, taking a series
of years together, equal the expen
ditures or else the revenues must
be increased. Last year there was
a deficit. Unless our expenditures
can be kept within the revenues
then our revenue laws must be re
adjusted.
But in making this statement I
must in no wise be understood as
advocating the false economy which
is in the end the worst extravagance.
To cut down on the Navy, for in
stance, would be a crime against the
Nation. To fail to push forward all
work on the Panama Canal would be
as great a folly.
One of the most effective instru
ments for the peace is the Monroe
Doctrine as it has been and is being
gradually developed by this Nation
and accepted by other nations.
National Park Resevations.
The President recommends to the
Congress the enlargement of the
bounds of the Yellowstone National
Park, the protection of the Niagara
Falls and the establishment of such
other park reservations as Congress
may see fit to set apart. The great
benefits of these national parks to
science as well as to the health and
happiness of the people is pointed
out.
The Hague Conference.
This tribunal, established for the
purpose of arbitrating matters of in
ternational difference, has already ac
complished much good. Matters of
armament and defense and also the
duties of neutral powers in time of
war have been brought and dis
cussed before this high tribunal, and
a better understanding between the
nations of the earth has already
grown out of the meetings.
The Civil Service.
The civil service law has been on
the statute books for twenty-two
years. Every President and a vast
majority of the heads of departments
who have in office during that period
have all along been strong advocates
of the merit system The moe
thoroughly its principles have been
understood, the greater has been the
favor with which the law has been
regarded by administerative of
ficers. Any attempt to carry on the
great executive departments of the'
Government without this law would
inevitably result in choas. The Civil
Service Commissioners are doing ex
cellent work; and their compensa
tion is inadequate considering the
service they perform.
Labor.
The National Government has as
a rule but little occasion to deal with
the formidsble group of problems
connected more or less directly with
what is known as the labor question,
for in the great majority of cases
these problems must be dalt with by
the State and municipal authorities
and not by the National Government.
Insurance.
The great insurance companies af
ford striking examples of corpora
tions whose business has extended so
far beyond the. jurisdiction of the
State which created them as to pre
clude strict enforcement of supervi
sion and regulation by the parent
States.
Recent events have emphasized the
importance of an early and exhus
tive consideration of this question,
to see whether it is not possible to
furnish better safeguards than the
several States have been able to fur
nish against corruption of the flag
rant kind which has been exposed.
Pensions.
The soldier who did his duty in
the time of war should receive the
benefits of a grateful country, but
here as elsewhere, a strict watch
should be kept to prevent fraud.
The Army and Navy.
We cannot consider the question of
our foreign policy without at the
same time treating of the Army and
the Navy. We now have a very
small army—indeed, one well-nigh
infinitesimal when compared with the
army of any other large nation. Of
course the we do have should
be as nearly perfect of its kind and
for its size as possible. I do not be
lieve that any army in the world has
a better average of enlisted men or
a belter type of junior officers; but
the Army should be trained to act
effectively in the mass. Provision
should be made by sufficient appro
priations for maneuvers of a practi
cal kind so that the troops may learn
how to take care of themselves undei
actual service conditions; every march
for instance, being made with the
soldier loaded exactly as he would
be in active campaign. The generals
and colonels should thereby have op
portunity for handling regiments,
brigades, and divisions, and the com
misary and medical departments
would be tested in the field. Provis
ion should be made for the exercise
at least of a brigade and by pefer
enee 01 a envision in marching and
embarking at some point and continu
ing its march, The number of posts
in which the Army is kept in time of
peace should be materially diminished
and the posts that are left made cor
respondingly large. No local inter
ests should be allowed to stand in
the way of assembling the greater
part of the troops which would at
need form onr field armies in stations
of such size as will permit the best
training to be given to the personnel
of all grades, including the high affi
eers and staff officers. To accom
plish this end we must have not com
pany or regimental garrisons, but
brigade and division garrisons.
Admission to Statehood.
I recommend that Indian Territory
and Oklahoma be admitted ar. one
State and that Mexico and Arizona
be admitted as one State. There is
no obligation upon us to treat terri
torial subdivisions, which are mat
ters of convenience only, as bind
ing us on the queestion of admission
to statehood.
Panama Canal.
The treatment between the United
States and the Republic of Panama,
under which the construction of the
Panama Canal was made possible,
went into effect with its ratification
by the United States on April 23,
1904, on payment of $40,000,000 to
that company. On April 1, 1905, the
Commission was reorganized and it
now consists of Theodore P. Shonts,
chairman, Admiral Mordecai T. En
cott, Brig. Gen. Peter C. Hines, and
Col. Oswald H. Ernst.
The Department of State.
I recommend more adequate pro
vision then has been made hereto
fore for the work of the Depart
ment of State. Within a few years
there has been a very great increase
in the amount and importance of the
work to be done by that Department,
both in Washington and abroad. The
crease of our foreign trade, the in
crease of wealth among our people,
increase of our foreign trade,the in
crease of American capital which is
seeking investment in foreign coun
tries, and the growth of our power
and weight in the councils of the
civilized world.
Federal Elections.
The President touches upon the
question of Federal elections quot
ing the well known constitutional
provision that Congress shall be the
final judge of the qualification of its
own members. He also declares
strongly against all forms of corrup
tion and expresses regret at the grow
ing tendency to increase expenses in
connection with the conduct of po
litical campaigns. Brjfly, he ad
vocates the greatest possible purity
of the ballot and the fullest free
dom of the exercise of the elective
franchise consistent with good gdv
ernment.
Immirgration.
The subject of immigration is treat
ed by Mr. Roosevelt in a particular
ly able and thoughtful manner. The
tendency of foreigners to congregate
in sections of the country already
congested with people is deplorable.
High-class foreigners are desirable
and are welcomed, but only those
with tendencies toward good citizen
ship and of industrious and law-abid
ing habits will add to the general
welfare of the nation. It is pointed
out that our farming sections need
labor, and that all who come with a
will to work will find a ready welcome
The Jamestown TercentenniaL
This enterprise is highly commend
ed by the President, who heartily sets
the seal of his approval upon every
thing Congress may see fit to do to
assist in making it a success.
Conclusion.
Suitable provisions should be made
for the expense of keeping our dip
lomatic officers more fully informed
of what is being done from day to
day in progress of our diplomatic
affairs with other countries. The
lack of such information, caused by
insufficient provision being made
for cable tolls and for clarica! and
other necessary assistance places
our officers at a great disadvantage
and detracts from their usefulness.
The salary list should be readjusted,
it does not now correspond either to
the importance of the service to be
rendered and the degrees of ability
and experience required in the dif
ferent positions, or to the differences
in the cost of living. In many cases
the salaries are quite inadequite.
. THEODORE ROOSEVELT.
The White House,
December 5, 1905.
WEIGHT THROWN
AT PRESIDENT
Missile Crashes Into Bis Special
Train.
Ml. ROOSEVELT IS NOT INJURE"
A Mason's Plumb Bob, Weighed Two and a
e Half Pouoda, Throws by Someone Uokown
Through Car Window, at Wblcb Sat Major
Webb Hayee, Whose Profile la a Duplicate
of Roosevelt.
Washington (Special).—As President
Roosevelt’s special train was passing
North Philadelphia at 7.30 P.
M., en route to Washington some un
known person hurled a mason’s plumb
bob through one of the windows of the
combination car Salvius.
The implement was of iron and
weighed about two and one-half pounds.
Webb Hayes, of Ohio, son of the late
President Rutherford B. Hayes, was sit
ting in the combination car Salvius read
ing a newspaper. Several other gentle
men were in the car, and the conversa
tion turned on the striking facial resem
blance between Mr. Hayes and President
Roosevelt. No sooner had this fact been
remarked upon than the crash was heard.
Pieces of glass were thrown in every di
rection, and a heavy missile dropped to
the floor on the far side of the car.
Everybody jumped to his feet, for it
was thought for a moment that Mr.
Hayes had been hurt, for the projectile
passed within a dozen inches or so of
his face. The missile proved to be a
plumb-bob, a conical-shaped piece of lead
The train was running at a great rate
of speed, but had slowed down somewhat
upon entering the city limits. It is con
sidered by the railroad men who were
on the train as very doubtful whether the
miscreant could have aimed at Mr. Hayes
with design, for the train was running
at least 18 miles an hour. The incident
was especially startling, however, from
the fact of a strong resemblance of Mr.
Hayes to the President. The combina
tion car was running next to the engine,
while the President's car was at the rear
of the train, with several cars filled with
army and navy officials intervening be
tween it and the car where the startling
incident took place.
The weather was heavy and a dense
fog which prevailed rendered it almost
impossible for the engineer to see a train
length ahead of him. Broad Street, in
North Philadelphia, had just been cross
ed and the train was in the vicinity of
Oxford Street when the crash of glass
ford Street when the crash of glass
aroused the occupants of the car.
Doubt was expressed by officials of the
Pennsylvania Railroad who were on th%
train whether the missile was intended
to be hurled at the President. They say
that several times recently stones have
been thrown at trains passing through
North Philadelphia, and on one recent oc
casion a man sitting at one of the win
dows of a car was severely cut by brok
en glass when a heavy stone crashed
through it.
No clue to the thrower of the missile
was obtained, although the incident was
reported to the officials of the Pennsyl
vania Railroad at Philadelphia, and the
statement was made that it would be in
vestigated thoroughly. The President
himself knew nothing of the matter until
nearly an hour after it occurred.
The implement thrown at the train
was a most unusual one to be in the
hands of a boy, who might, in a spirit
of deviltry, thrown a stone at a train.
It is of cast iron and weighs about
three pounds. Had it struck Major
Hayes on the head as it certainly would
if it had passed through the window a
foot lower, he certainly would have been
injured very seriously, if not killed.
The President knew nothing of the in
cident for sometime after it occurred.
He made no comment upon it, passing it
off as the wanton act of some irrespon
sible person. As a measure of precau
tion, the curtains at the windows of sev
eral of the cars were drawn down after
the news of the incident spread among
the passengers on the train.
The Secret Service officers who ac
companied the President took carge of
the missile, and an effort will be made,
through the Secret Service Bureau, to
apprehend the person who threw it.
SEED DEALERS PROTEST.
They Want the aoveritment’i Distribution to
Cetse.
Washington (Special).—Thirty of the
leading seed dealers of the country have
sent President Roosevelt a petition pro
testing against the free distribution of
seeds by members of Congress, and urg
ing him to include in his message a para
graph disapproving the present practice
and recommending that only the intent
of the original act authorizes seed distri
bution be the future policy. This intent,
the petition says, was that the seeds
should be obtained from remote cor
ners of the earth and be unknown to the
people of this country, and be for the
purpose of increasing the wealth of the
nation.
The petitioners allege that the present
practice is a “grievous restraint of trade,”
and that the United States should abolish
the practice as unfair, as a class legis
lation, antagonistically so, against a
branch of commerce unbecoming a great
government.
John Bartletl Dead.
Cambridge Mass., (Special). John
Bartlett, compiler of “Bartlett’s Family
Quotations," died at his home, in this
city, aged 85 years. He was born in
Plymouth, Mass., and until his retire
ment, some years ago, was a publisher
and author. His other best-known work
was a concordance of Shakespeare.
Eotlre Board of Health Oat.
Chicago (Special).—A dispatch to tfie
Chronicle from New Orleans says: “The
Louisiana State Board of Health, Dr.
Edmund Souchon president, resigned in
a body. This action was precipitated
by a persistent intimation of Governor
Blanchard that he wanted an investiga
tion as to how yellow fever got into
Louisiana and, who was responsible and
by his last action of calling upon the
Grand Jury of Orleans parish to inves
tigate.” !

Not Known.
LIEUT. SCHMIDT TRIED TO ESCAPE
Batteries Trained on City—Troops, Supposed
ly Loyal, Desert at the Last Moment and
Their Stronghold Is Taken With Bayonets—
M Ships Under Mutineers Are Now Sold to
Be Ont ol Commission,
Sevastopol, via Warsaw (By Cable). —
During the battle between the rebel and*
loyal vessels of the Black Sea fleet a
1 mining ship, which had 200 Whitehead
torpedoes and other explosives on board,
was sunk by her commander, who feared
that she would be struck by a shell.
Some regiments, with artillery, have
arrived here from Odessa and other
places.
Warsaw (By Cable). —According to
the few details which have reached War
saw regarding the sea and land battle at
Sevastopol, the rebel fleet in the evening
of November 28 opened an attack on
three loyal warships—the battleship Ros
tislav, the torpedo-gunboat Captain Sack
en and the armored cruiser Pamyat Az
ova.
The latter replied briskly, damaging
the rebel torpdo-boat dstroyr Svirepy
and sinking a torpedo boat. The coast
batteries also joined in and set fire to
the cruiser Otchakoff, commanded by
the rebel leader, Lieutenant Schmidt
The latter, with his mutinous followers,
tried to escape in boats, but was captured l
by loyal torpedo boats. At the same time
the Bielostok regiment attacked the bar- 1
racks occupied by the mutineers. Fifteen
hundred of these, with ten Maxim guns,
surrendered druing the night. The num
ber of killed and wounded is not known.
St. Petersburg (By Cable) —The Navy
Department is closed not only to the
public, but to officers except those of the
General Staff.
j No official statement on the subject of
the battleship at Sevastopol has been
issued and the public remains in the dark,
. compelled to be content with the countless
rumors which are in circulation. It is
reported from a semi-official source that
although the Otchakoff, the Dnieper and
,a transport were set on fire and sunk
during yesterday's battle, all the muti
neers have not yet surrendered. Vice-
Admiral Chouknin was in command of
the loyal vessels, some of which, includ
ing the Pateleimon, took part in the en
gagement. Gen. Baron Meller Gako
melskie, commander of the Seventh Ar
my Corps, with 21,000 infantry and artil
lery, was in chief command ashore.
The newspaper accounts of the details
of the fighting at Sevastopol, which are
based on the reports circulating in the
city, are very conflicting, but they all say
the battle ended at about 5.30 P. M.,
when the ships of the mutineers sur
rendered.
The Novosti says that 5,000 men per
ished on both sides. The leaders of the
inutineers, it is added, have already been
executed, two battleships have been
blown up and mines have been laid at
the entrance of the roadstead.
According to the Slovo the mutineers
themselves began the attack. After wait
ing until 3 P. M. for a reply to the de
mands of the mutineers, which included
the convocation of a constituent assem
bly and the immediate realization of the
reforms promised in the imperial mani
festo, Lieutenant Schmidt opened fire on
the city from 10 vessels. Vice-Admiral
Chouknin replied from the loyal war
ships and Gen. Baron Meller Gakomels
kie from the southern forts and with
the coast artillery. The mutinous sailors
used rifles and machine guns on the en
trenched infantry.
The fight, the Slovo says, lasted for
two and a quarter hours. The mutineers
'made a heroic struggle, but the odds were
too heavy, and when the Otchakaoff, bat
tered to pieces and on fire, sank with the
cruiser Dnieper and a transport, Lieu
tenant Schmidt, who was mortally
wounded, surrendered the mutinous
squadron and mutinous sailors on shore
hauled down their flag to the Brest and
Bielostok regiments.
According to the Russ, however, Ad
miral Chouknin and Generals Gakomels
kie called on the mutineers to surrender,
whereupon, under the orders of Lieuten
ant Schmidt, the mutinous vessels, which
had replaced the flag of St. Andrew with
a red flag, responded by hoisting the
battle flag.
When the battle began the batteries on
the north side, which were supposed to
be loyal, instead of firing on the muti
neers, joined the cause with them and
directed their fire on the city and on the
south-side batteries. The Brest regi
ment therupon stormed the northern bat
teries with fixed bayonets and the guns
were soon turned on the ships and the
barracks of the mutineers.
The Listok says that the conspiracy
which led to the mutiny went on under
the nose* of the officers and that even
Vice-Admiral Birileff, the Minister of
Marine, who was at Sevastopol a fort
night ago, suspected nothing. The sail
ors waited until they were assured of the
support of the troops, most of whom,
however, refused to go over to the mu
tineers when the die was cast.
