The action of thc confer.-ncc at Sidney han
placed thc Australian colonies in direct ami
foniiiil opposition to theil motin-,-country.
'The dele-rates from the .arion.-- colonial Legis
lutiiies have unanimously molved that thc
New-Ilfbrcdcs, Ncw-(iuiiic,i and otliei Boatfa
Sea Lslands should be uiincxcd to Australia.
Tbe home Government is just M \\nn la jt8
determination not to allow then dependencies
to pilbil their colonization schemes any (nither.
There is, ol' lunn ?<> probability of trouble
ratulting from this diilerenee ol opiniou, at
least ut present. The Australians will wait
patiently until thc Conservatives come into
power again in England, and puss tin ii
claims one? more. If they should be met with
a refusal then, however, the situation might be?
come strained.
?
If the Excise Commissioners reilly desire to
eoe our inadequate Excise laws properly en?
forced, it is unfortunate that tin y always man?
age to range themselves ou the side ol the law?
breakers. They have Just extracted an opinion
from their counsel to the effect that even if a
iiquor-dealer does violate tho law, his license il
Bot revoked until they choose to declare it so.
Thia ia inteudod, of course, to relieve convicted
liquor.dealers from the culbarra?-Mt* which
lusjiector Thome's recent order to Ul nub-.
oidJaatsW has canned thcui. It is to be hoped
tliat the matter may be pushed to a apeedj de?
cision in the higher courts, for the Board's
counsel, the Hon. M Tom " Creamer, is not the
best legal authority iu thc State. Neither la
tin- opinion ot a police justice infallible. Thc
police in the meantime should go right ahead in
thc course they have pursued for the last week.
Ii they cannot do anything oleo,thej can at
least accumulate evidence enough to show that
thc Excise Board is the most worthless branch of
the City Govenimeut.
A flood of 227 bills was let loose in the
Renate yesterday. So far aa aaa be Judged
from the dispatches, they relate to almost
every possible subject of legislation exeept the
tariff. Mr. Edmunds came to the front with an
elaborate scheme to provide for the establish?
ment of four Government postal telegraph
lines, and also a measure amendiug the laws
relating to bigamy. Mr. Sherman offered a bill
to provide for the issue of circulation to
National banks. Measures regulating the
Presidential succession were also proposed.
Tho interest* of the lobby wore not neglected,
for there were numerous bills relating to pen?
sions and claims of all kinds. If the sugges?
tions in the President's Message are heeded, ?
good many of these bills will never get beyoud
the committees. In the House thc Democrats
scored another blunder, this time, in the con?
tested election case of Garrison against Mayo
of Viigiula. Mr. Raud.Ul showed that ha bore
DO grudges by trying to check the Impetuosity
of his more unscrupulous fcllow-iiiembers.
The Grand Jury which has l>een investigating
thc Dauville (Va.) riot has gone Democratic,
and duds that there is no reason to present In
"fl 111 lill tl against anybody for participation in
that painful adair. If the Grand Jurors lind
been wiso they would have contented them?
selves with merely announcing their decision.
They ruin themselves by giving theil' reasons.
They say that after the fight between Noell and
Lawson the negroes indulged in threats against
tlie wliites, who thereupon drew their pistols
and fired in the air in order to scare away the
blacks. But the negroes wickedly refused to be
frightened. More of then flocked to the spot,
and thus precipitated a riot, ls anything nor?
than this showing needed to prove that the
whites are mainly reeponafble for the fatal
trouble T Plainly not. If the white men had
been sensible, law-abiding citizens they would
have got ont of tlie way when they saw that
trouble was brewing. But instead of withdraw?
ing thejT Wt obliged to stay and lire their pis?
tols in the air ! It would have been strange if
no trouble had followed that performance.
Next time a partisan Grand Jiu v would do well
to keep its partisan reasoning to itself.
TUE FBESIDENTS MESSAGE.
President Arthur's if maa un ii a -straightfor?
ward and business-like document. The digest*1
of the Department reports, of which it la largely
composed, arc (leal and sal isfaeloiy. The
recommendations und suggestions as ? mle are
sensible ami well digested. In no sense a great
message, it is nevei theloM well calculated to
produce aa excellent impression on the country.
Thc opening paragraph! are devoted to our
relations to other counti its. These continue <ui
a friendly footing willi nothing to warrant Ho?
llie belief that tiny will not remain so for an
indefinite period. Attention is called to the
Importance of the ilsh.ii.s Indnatriea on the
north coast of thc Atlantic and the Pacilic ; to
the need that exists for the revision ot our logia
latina touching pauper immigration; to t|jc
propriety of increasing the consular corps sn ;,.
to place a Conaul-General at catii capital in
Central America and ai the Bulgarian capital;
and to the inc.cusable deluy in the settlement
of sundry of OUT claims against Spain. '1 beac
are lim more interesting of thc points that are
covered andor thia general head. The eonsid
orationa thal follow tonehing the mach-dis
cussed (jiiesiion of surplus revenue and debt re?
duction, arc cogently presented. The Preaidenl
doea not adviae the adoption al thia aeaaion of
any meaanrecalculated hugely to diminish the
National revenues, believing it the perl ol .\i>
dom to wait foi the results of the legislation
had nt the last session of Congress. Tor the pres
cut bo wisely thinks.! portion at least of the -lu?
pins can be profitably -pent In restoring our
Navy to proportion! commensurate with our re?
quirement- .uni in providing coast defences foi
tlu- protection of our harbors. Thia last sugges
lion is timely and excellent, but another which
is coupled with lt for the creation of an interior
coast line ol water-way.-* will hardly bc received
with as much general favor, lt is not cl. ai
that the people are yet ready for such a achene.
On the subject of legislation in regald to the
National currency the, Message, after glancing
at the danger that would attend an extensive
retirement of tha securities, which are the basis
Of tha National bank circulation, favois im?
portant change* in the lnws by which thal cir
ealation la now controlled. The recommenda?
tion is made that a law be peaced repealing Uie
lax on circulation and permitting the hanks to
issue note, foi aa amount equal to BO per cent ol
the mai kit value of theil bonds. I he Meeaage is
equally specific In regard to the trade dollar. The
Preeident thinks the beat way to diapoee of tlii
nuisance ia to turn it into the Treasury and the
mints as bullion. There will he general approv?
al of tho. paragraph in regard io the consolida?
tion of revenue districts, bj there has already
been of what thc President lias accom?
plished in this pioinising field of retrenchment
The Indians have been so well behaved dm ing
the year that they are disposed of iu a, few im?
material sentences. But not so the .Mormons,
in bia laat Meeaage the Preaidenl expressed the
bone that the polygamy problem could be
solved without resorting to radical measures.
Ile docs not talk in that cheerful strain this
year. He favors the repeal of the act upon
which the existing Government ol' Utah depends
and the assumption by the National Legisl.il uii
of the entire political conliol of the Territory.
The tad that tin- Preeideul is thoroughly In
earnest and proposes an Important aggreaslre
movement will gratify the count iv and ought lo
have a salutary effect upon Congress, hading to
-onie prompt and decisive action on the Mor?
mon question.
Reaching the consideration of the postal tole ?
graph achene, the Meeaage becomes lees clear.
No adequate idea eu ba formed of what the
Preeident really thinks on the subject. While
opposing the purchase <>f existing lines or
thc Construction of new ones hy the Qof
eminent, he still avows his belief Ihat the
Government should he authorized hy law to ex?
ercise "some supervision over iiit.-r-Stnt?? tele?
graph communication.*1 Hut ha fails to explain
the nature or extent ol the -upi r\ i-ion thal he
would regard as judicious, sine as it appears in
the statement that he does not bellera the <?.>*.
errunent should assume the same control OYO!
Ihe telegraph which it has ovei the mail. Tha
portion of the Message which treats of the leg*
ulution ot railroads is sensible and, as far aa
it goes, practical. Tho recommendations of
last year in regard to Federal aid to education,
thc Presidential succession and the need of a
constitutional umeud-nout giving the President
pewee to veto particular items are renewed.
There are suggestive passages devoted to agri?
culture, the future of Alaska and the protection
of forests and postal aflairs. On the subject of
Civil Service n-foiin Utile is said. Rut that lit?
tle is interesting and to the point. The Piesi
ilent c.presses the gratifying opinion that thc
new system has worked well. The conclusion
Of the Message is an appropriate and patri?
otic reference to the recent decision of the
Supreme Court tom liing the Fourteenth Amend?
ment.
The document is wen-written throughout and
then-is little waste of words. It will repay a
careful perusal._
BEPOBT OE 6ECBETABY FOLQBB,
Secretary Fidget has not dom himself justice
in his report The document ia very long, ver?
bose ami windy, and would not be printed by
anybody if lt were nol an official paper. All
there is in it of public interest could have been
put into three or four columns of our type hy a
gentle-Ban Of Hr. Folger's ability. It ia offen?
sive to make an important public document so
wordy and ttreo-anc thal people who hare any?
thing to do ii. this world will never read the
whole of it, unless under compulsion.
What the Secretary has to say of the reve?
nue mid expenditures for the las! -teal year is
old. of ((tulse, anil it is not wholly his faull that
it is wen isome. He might have said in a few
words that the revenue exceeded thc expendi?
tures by $13-1.17ri,7^7, nnd that he estimated
the surplus for the current year at about
$80,000,000. It will probably be found that
hois in error in this estiinati?that tho reduc?
tion of debt less cash lu the Treasury, if there is
no change of the laws, will be greater than lie
has supposed. A more Important dilllciilty,
however, is that the Secretary doea not seem
prepared to recommend any mode of reducing
or applying thc "surplus revenue.
It does not appear to the Secretary that
it would Ix- wise to cut off the internal
taxes. In that position (a? to whiskey
at least) he should have the support of
Republican members of Congress. Hut he
thinks that thc late revision of tariff'was not as
effective as it wm Intended to lu-, and that the
remedy for a redundant nv.nile must ultimate?
ly be found in a further reduction Of the tariff.
Nevertheless, because the late revision has been
iii font- but a short lime, and its effects (.innot
yet h.- fully measured, Mr. Polger docomo, ad?
vise a eh.inge ot lalill at this session. The tax
iiii hank circulation he thinks unwise, and
lilt Kill he will be Mlppol ted hy con-cr. ali" c
men, but ihe repeal of lins tai would still leave
a surplus of 075,000,000, even upon Mr. Fol
gt i's estimate, and he doea mu seem to know
what to do in order to fret rid ..f it. The weak?
est part of the report is the Secret.liv's tlc.it
incut of the proposal to distribute the surplus
among the States. Ile thinks it is ?'not tho
function of government t<> raise money to be do?
nated to the States," aad no one supposed thal
it was. Hut wi.-er men and abler Jurists than
Mi. Potger?without any discourtea) to him it
may bo said?-deemed ii proper many yean ago
to make a distribution lo I lie Statea ot funds ill

oi even fatal objections to the plan under eon*
sitleration, but it must I..- -aid thal Secretary
Folger fails to point ou^anj of them. lithe
United statis eau properly expend money for
public education, Mr. Folgei tails to show why
it may not properly expend ihat money through
the siiite Government-.
As to the National banks, thc rccointin mil?

THE PEA IS Ht ITU.
While The World und other representatives
of thc Democracy of the Baal are living, willi
some feeble assistance from Mr. Carlisle him?
self, to disguise the significance of thc Bpeaker<
-hip contest, and drive the party back for a few
mont hr- to it-old dishonesty, ii is satisfaetorj
t0 see that thele ale I Linoel al lc olgans hold
enough to tell tha plain tyiih about the matter,
?* The Democratic majority In the House of He
" presentatives,*1 say- Thr Shh," have definitely
'? planted tin ms. ht - upon tlu.- doctrine of Free
"Trade,and have declared their hostility to
"every form, degree and kimi of tariflTprotoe
'?timi toward American Industry.*1 This uta
hank ami an exact statement <>i the situation,
and il is the moic impressive 0000080 Thr Shh
believes that the new departure is ii fatal
blunder, it has always maintained that the
course its part* has just adopted would lead ii
io iiiin. ami it la now printing letters to show
the difficulty ol electing s President on the Car?
lisle policy.
Bul after all, The Sun is follow ing Um wises!
plan. Themischiel is done, and cannot be ex?
plained awaj ; and the attempt t.. show thal
Mr. Carlisle did not mean what he said before
his election, and trill not cany out the policy
to which he is pledged.-! an iitlr.uil to him, a
disgrace to its anthon, ami a discouragement to
the pally. The only chalice for Ihe Dcmoc racv
is to stand right np to its Free-Trade doctrine
and fight its best un that issue. The chalice is
a poor .nu-, but lhere is no other. Whatever the
apologists may say now, Fire 'I rude has become
the question of the campaign, ami If the Desnoe
rac] is afraid to meet ii, the election goes by
default li is too late to change.
ARRESTS HY CHILE.
The discharge of the Englishman, Flood, or
Pelly, WOO was arrested on a ciihle message
charging him With forgery in England, ought
to convince tba English Government thal if ii is
worth while lo cahle n demand inr the arrest
Of BO licensed fugitive, it is worth while to give
our authorities such particulars as will Justify
tlit-ni In holding the defendant The itiiti-h
authorities ought aol to expect that K la enough
merely to telegraph a description of the person
wanted, and the designation pf the charge
against him. Tiny should realise that it ba
serious matter to arrest and hold men or women
against whom there is nothing in the Hhape of
evidence. The establishment of mich a prece?
dent would tend to open thc door for grave
abuses. Arrests might be made from malicious
and Minister motives. Honest men might be
ihus soiled with the suspicion ol' felony just as
they entered a new country, to which they had
resorted in the hope of improving their condi?
tion. To arrest a innn without informing him
of tho nature of the charge preferred against
him is moreover an infraction of American
law. The accused haa .1 right to this informa?
tion immediately npon his arrest, and if it is
withheld from him the wrong is shown in tho
Ead that lie is thus hindered from defending
hi nisei f.
In the else nndaff notice the man was charged
with forgery, but all the particulars were with?
held. If he asked when and whore and under
what circiuiistancis he was alleged to have Com?
mitted the oflencc, nobody hore could give him
the information. Of course, this ought not to be
tob rated, and in refusing to tolerate it Commis?
sioner ((shorn has done liis duty. There can bo
no good reason why the British Government
should not in all such cases cable the particulars
of the charge, and now that the discharge of an
accused person has resulted from this remiss?
ness, it is probable that tho false economy which
.seems to have lieon at tho bottom of the omis?
sion w ill he abandoned. It may be that in this
Case a guilty person hus cHcaped justice. That
would bc a mutter for regret, no doubt, but lt is
nevertheless much bettor that one guilty poison
should escape than that the Aniericjiu adminis?
trative machinery should be abused by the em?
ployment of it to barana and injure the possibly
innocent. And there is reason to believe that
not more than one winning of this kind will bo
required by the English Government.
PAISTINO TUE LILY.
The London Morning Post says ? lt is probable
that Mr. Tennyson, tho poet, will ahortly be
raised to the jieorago." We hope thin nows is
not true. Alfred Tennyson cannot bo ennobled
by Queen Victoria. He pooseeooa already a
patent of nobility in comparison with which
Ihe highest rank the greatest sovereign ian be?
stow in insignificant. He who wears the laurel
crown worthily and with the suffrages of half
the world, has nothing to ask from princes, nor
is it in their power to exult him. And what
? hould Mr. Tennyson do with a peerage 1
When I haili s Dil kens refused that honor it was
felt that he had merely declined what would
have been liol morely an unpopular honor, but a
Compromising one. Il is thc special virtue ol'
genius to render its possessor independent of al!
ceremonial ami artificial distinctions. Thora ls a
kimi of beauty in woman m. dignified, pore and
ennobling that it readers all adventitious
adornments not only pettj ami futile, hm dis?
cordant and intrusive. Just so is it with the
nobility of genius. The fortunata p.???n nt
ihat high gilt not only needs no adventitious
aids, bm tbe] clash with the Insignia of thal
spiritual lank which distinguishes lum. Bo
tween genius and mere hereditary aristocracy,
indeed, theie is all the difference between
ihiturs celestial and tiling- terrestrial. Thc un?
happy Thompson, th.- author of that powerftd
[.oem "The Cit- "? l?i cati fa I Nigh i," ha- in so?
other poem, entitled "The Naked Qoddesa,*1
allegorized this distinction. lin- nowa is
brought to a certain town that a beautiful naked
goddi? has tas.-n up her abode in the neigh?
boring forest. Forthwith lt is determined that
she inii-t h.- clothed, ami lin. people go out, and
when she appears before them the priests snd
the sag.--and the magistrates in turn ofter her
such robes M they wear. Tin goddess tues Hie
vestments on, but they ate all loo narrow, and
om- by one she dings from her theil ci amping
and confining folds. So genius spurns the
trammels of earthly decorations.
There is no fame to acct nc, to Mr. Tenn.-on
from a title. He baa woo a world-wide celeb?
rity already. Mis nama ls ?'familiar in our
mouths as household wolds." Wherever the
English language ia apoken in Greatei as wei!

' Commissioner McFarland states (hat the
-pi . iii 1 agents appointed by the General hand
Office have une.utheil a great deal of fraud,
both in timber and grazing lands. The
most extensive frauds, he aaya, au- found
ill tin- grazing country, ''where the cattle
"kings have fenced in the country by whole
"counties, and the investigations made by
"agents show (hat tho land within these in
u closures is being covered by bogus entries
"made by employes of the atockmen, thc former
" supplying tin- needed affidavits of settlement
"and the hitter paying the Land Ollie- fees and
"pocketing the till.-." It may bo added that
the tendency iu the stock-raising legion has for
some lime been toward tito "freelingout" of
all lite small eadie tuen hy the cattle kings .m,I
gi.-at stock-raising corporations, in many
eases tbe small owners have been literally
foil ed lo sell out by being fenced away from
water. The wealthy callie men have run theil
fences in all direct ions over (he plains, and
have drive., their poorer Competitors out of thc
business hy flagrantly illegal methods. Under
the ciiiiini-laiices resistance has been -SCleSS,
and scores of owners of small Innis of cattle
ami sheep have been glad ol the opportunity to
sellout at almost any price, that being tia al?
ternative willi complete ruin.
Of late the attempts referred to hy Commie
stoner McFarland, to obtain legal possession of
(he land by hiting their employes lo make en?
tries, have been lcKortcd to, but before that
these Immense tracts were held openly by the
simple tight of the stniiige-t ; and as the cattle
kings always had at their command numbera of
reckless retainers, it WM a hazardous an
dei laking for any poor man to try to defend his
rights, or even to make ton loud remonstrance.
Though ih.- practice lias existed of leaving
occasional entrances to prater, experience proves
that when- a waterway is fenced for miles, with
only a few of theee albys at long intervals,
cattle may and do fail to lind the open places in
had weather, and Deriah in consequence, lu
fail, there are many reforms called for in the
grating country, which is more and more surely
falling into thc hands ol monopolists, ami
which is consequently co.using lo utlonl oppor?
tunities Inr intel prise and industry lo thc mass
of naen who cannot coiunuuid much capital to
begin a ith. Clearly thc special agents have a
wide field of usefulness before them.
SOMETHING NEW IN SOCIAL SCIENCE.
A recent number of Tkei London Telegraph con
fains a report of a remarkable caa?, lately tried at
the London Assizes. It is remarkable because ol
the new and startling views which It presents of the
sigaileaaee Of the marriage relation. One Betsey
Wardle was charged with marrying George Chisnal
bigBSSM-dy. The evidence exhibited her as the
possessor Ol a living husband at the time that she
was given away to Mr. Chisnel. She did not deny
tha charge, but explained that since number oue
had sold lue tn number two for a quart of beer, she
labored under the impression that she had a right to
contract tho second marriage. Fancy a woman
with ho little sense of things, so little appreciative
of the inherent strength of tho marriage bond, as
melly te believe that those whom God joins to?
gether can be lawfully sundered with a glans of
beer !
Hut the report shows that Betsey was not the only
woman that had such faith in tho potency of beer.
ShaintbrmsdtheJaatice before whom shewasar
raigned that Margaret Brown was aware of the fact
of the salo. Margaret Brown was accordingly called.
She testified that she was present at the second
BSStriagS; that she knew that tho first husband
was then alive ; and that shu was informed that he
lind sold Ms wife for a quart of beor. " You be?
lieved tho sale would bo binding T " Inquired tho
Court. ?* Yes. sir," replied Margaret, adding. tx$ an
earliest of her good faith. " she [Betsey] wished BM
to give her away, and 1 did no." Margaret wa*s dis
mlssai with the reproof from the bench, "Von
helped her to commit bigamy. Take, care you do
not do lt again, or you will get luto trouble." Thc
next witness to take tho stand wits Mr. Chisnol,
thc second husband. He evidently is a plain, blunt
man, not given tu idealizing the grand passion or
regard tag tho union of two souls with but a single
thought as anything more sentimental or sacred
than an ordinary cot.tract. *? How did you come to
marry this woman T" ho was asked. He explained
la the Lancashire vernacular, " A bowt her." A
little later tho Court wanted to know if ho desired
to take her back, on which ho complacently re?
marked, " Awl keep her if you loike," Thc inten?
tion was to take tlie testimony of tits Int husband
on ihe delicate point In controversy. Bot Correa*
?."iii lu--.! known to himself Ihat graceless (haler in
-rives was absent. Counsel for th.* woman that
had committed bigamy held, in behalf of his client,
that Inr tirst bartend had been a bad mau and her
?aeon- an Ignoramus. And because she bad baan
subjaeted to these two misfortunes hs argued thst
she ought BOl to bo punished al least n..t se?
verely. The Justin ill disposing0. the case de?
ll.neil that it was absolutely necessary th.it ?oms
punishment should lu; I ni fi oap*., "iu order that
people may under.tan.I that men have m. more
righi to sell their wives than they have to sell other
people's wives, or to sell other people's horses or
towser anything Of the kind. Bo many of you
??"em tobe Ignorant of thisth.it it is necessary I
should give you [the prisoner) snliie punishment in
order that you B-sy understand it. Itisnotnee*

prisoned sud hept to hard labor for on.- week."
it ia not stated whether or so the ease was sp
pealed, or whether tbe writ of habeas eorpas was
invoked to villi.- Betsey's release. Bal wa can
well believe that tbe prisoner, ss well as Margsrot
Brown, the aecoad baa-band, his predecessor and tbs
other persona belonging ta their set, will (eel that

The West Point examinations and tho Harvard
paiiers (or women are considered terrible ordeals
(or the acade-uio youth of America; but a more
T
dreadful fate is reserved for boys of the age ot
twelve in the English public schools. From extracts
publishert in a London journal it appears that the
examination papers make large demands upon the
general intelligence of the. pupils. They are re?
quired, for example, to contrast the action of a cow
and horse io rising from a recumbent posture, and
of tho chaffinch and blackbird in flying, and to ex.
plain why sheep often graze on their knees. They
are called npon to recite special incidents in ths
careers of Oenseric, Mausolus, Diogenes, Michael
Scot, Lord Bacon, Ravaillac, Strabo, Ivan tho Ter?
rible and Louise Michel, togcthor with the plots of
six of Scott's novels. They are expected to toll
whether the anchor lost hy Columbus in his third
Atlautic voyage could have been recently dug up
by a gentleman in tho Island of Antigua. They ara
sternly questioned relative to democracy, oligar?
chy, plutocracy, pessimism, Swedenliorg, nepotism,
free trade, reciprocity, jingoism and verve, and are
required to furnish accurate information respecting
old Dresden chiua, the survival of the fittest, ab?
rasions of the cuticle and, finally, the peculiarities
of crusted port. Apparently tho last question might
be safely reserved for hoary old age. Any child ol
twelve who can survive the vicissitudes of such aa
inquisition must have beeu at birth a prodigy of
inquisitive ignorauce.
The World, which has been in a state of distress*
ing agitation ever since the election of its candi
date for Speaker, is good enough to say that " tha
Republicans need not worry about Free Trade. Thom
are not enough Free Trade Democrats, united with
tho Free Trade Republicans of The 7 inter and Evtaino
Post school, to make a respectable minority party.**
Very likely. And that is just what worries Th*
World. The Free Trade Democrats cannot make a,
respectable party, but they aro to have tho Job of
making as good a party as they can for the next
campaign; and Democrats who know what thal
means are fretting themselves sick.
