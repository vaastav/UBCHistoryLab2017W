The United States is now at wai
fwlth Austria-Hungary.
With unanimity except for a neg
ative vote cast in the house of rep
resentatives by a Socialist member
tooth houses of congress acted favor
ably on the request made by President
"Wilson in his recent address to con
gress that the United States declare
'war - on the dual monarchy, which
the president asserted was "not her
own mistress, but simply the vassal
of the German government." There
"was scarcely any debate on the war
resolution in either house.
Shortly after the action of the two
liouses of congress, President Wilson
.affixed hi3 signature to the .measure
which definitely aligned Austro-Hun-jgary
as an enemy country.
-This ended the anomolous situation
ihat has prevailed by reason of the
fact, that the United States had been
definitely at war with Germany, but
not .actively with Germany's chief
ally, although the - latter on land and
eea was waging. battle or carrying out
-excesses against the peoples and com-
inerce of countries . allied with the
United States in the task of making
.! . , ,v Aid to Be Given Italy.
j The. taking up of arms against Aus
tria-Hungary .comes at a most oppor
tune time, for it will permit, of , the
United .States lending aid to' sorely
etricken Italy, where the Austro-Ger-
mans are striving their utmost to deal
t blow, in' an endeavor to render the
. Italians a' negligible factor in future
operations. " '

tions. ' There are no reports of any bombs
having been dropped in the center of
London. Several fell in the suburbs,
but without doing any great damage.

the Germans relied more upon incen
diary than explosive bombs, with the
result that a number of fires broke

I It was known before the official re
port was issued that two of the raid
ers had been brought, down and their
crews of three men each captured
and that others of them were dam

ROADS UNDER CONTROL BEFORE
CHRISTMAS.
Congress Ready. to Support President
In Any Action for Ending "
Congestion.
Washington. ' Government opera
tion of railroads is hanging in the
balance. On President Wilson de
pends whether the government should
lend the rail ways' ,?1,000,000,000 or put
them under a federal dictator to end
the war freight Jam.
Some congressmen looked for the
president to seize control of the rail
roads before Christmas. They pre
dicted legislation for unification of
the lines would mean a long delay.
The president desires immediate re
lief. Under authority he already pos
sesses he could place every mile of
track under federal control by the
stroke of a pen.
The four railroad brotherhoods are
united with the railway executives
against . government control. Presi
dent Wilson is understood to have
been told this when the labor leaders
saw him recently regarding their wage
demands. The brotherhoods favor
financial and legislative aid to the
carriers to enable them to unify op
erations. ,
The railroad executives are prepar
ing estimates of the amount needed
for 1913 to place the lines on a war
efficiency basis. These estimates are
to be submitted by Senator Newlands

dent The president then is expected
to make known his views, possibly in
a special message to congress. x
Legislators said they would follow
the president's recommendations.

son for taking part in it."
