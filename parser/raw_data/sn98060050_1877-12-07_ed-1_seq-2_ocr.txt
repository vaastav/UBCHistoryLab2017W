THE r-ACiriOATION or THE COfSTHV.
To complete and nmko pernmuent tlio
pacification of tlio country continues In be,
Aud until it is fully accomplished, must remain
the most liiijiortant 01 (in our ibuuwi iuiu'
esta. Tho earnest purpose of good
..1.1I.. in .,t, !!,. ilioir efforts in this cluleav.
or Is evident. It found expression in the res.
olutions nnnoiineed in 1871 by tho national
conventions of tho leading political parties of
tho country- There was a widespread appro,
hension that tho momentous results in our
progress us a nation, marked by tho recent
iimendments to the constitution, were in im
minent jeopardy j that the good understand
ing which prompted their niloption in tho in
terest of ft loyal devotion to tho general wel
fare might prove n barren truce, and Hint tho
two sections of the country engaged n
civil strife might bo again almost ns widely
severed and disunited us they were when ar.
rayed in arms against each other.
The course to bo pursued, which, in my
judgment, seemed wisest in the presence of
this emergency, was plainly indicated in my
inaugural address. It pointed to tho time,
which nil our people desire to see, when n
genuine love of our whole country and of nil
that concerns its true welfare shaU supplant
the destructive forces of mutual animosity of
races and of sectional hostility. Opinions
have differed widely as to tho measures best
calculated to secure this great end. This was
to be expected. The measures adopted by
the administration hnvo been subjected to so
crc ond varied criticism. Any course what
ever which might have been entered upon
would certainly have encountered distrust and
opposition. Theso measures were, in my
judgment, such as were most in harmony with
the constitution and with the genius of our
people and best adapted, under all the eir
cuiiistances, to attain the end in Mew. lie
ueficcut results, already apparent, prove that
these endeavors arc not to bo regarded as a
mere experiment, nnd should sustain and en.
i'nunira us in our efforts. Already, in the
brief period which has elapsed, the immediate
effectiveness, no less than the justice, of the
course pursued is deinousimieii, duo i uae
un abiding faith that time will furnish its am
ple vindication in the minds wf the great ma
jority of my fellow citizens.
The discontinuance of the use of the army
for the purpose of upholding the local gov-
crimicnts in two States of tho Vnion, was no
less n constitutional dutrnud requirement, ttn-
.W Hie circumstances existing at tho time.
limn it wii s n much needed measure for the
restoration of the local sdf government and
tho promotion of national harmony. the
-withdrawal of tho troops from such employ
incut w-ns effected deliberately and with solic
itrtnu pnrp for the iieaee and good order of
society and the protection of property and
persons, and every rigm ol an classes en ciei
zens. The results that have followed are in
deed significant nnd encouraging. All appre
hension of danger from remitting those States
to local self government is disponed, ami u

way the restoration of harmony and good will
and the complete protection of every citizen
in the lull enjoyment oi every consiiiuuouui

Wliatever authority rests with me to this
end I shall not hesitate to put forth. What
ever belongs to the power of Congress and
the jurisdiction of the courts ol the I nion,
they may confidently be relied upon to pro
vida and perform. And to the legislatures.
the courts and the executive authorities of the
several States. I earnestly appeal to secure by
ndeiiuate, appropriate and seasonable means
-within their borelers these common and uni
form rights of a united people, which loves
liberty, abhors oppression aud reveres justice.
These objects are very dear to my heart and I
shall continue most euniostly to strive for
their attainment, Tlie cordial co-operation of
nil classes of all sections of the country and of
lsitlt races is required for this purpose, aud
with these blessings assured, and not other
wise, we may safely hope to hand down our

JlEsrMVTION or Sl'EClE PAYMENTS.
Amont; the other subjects of great and gen
oral imiKirtaneo to the people of this louutry
I cannot be mistaken, I think in regarding as
pre-eminent tho policy aud measures which
lire designed to secure the restoration of the
currency to that normal and healthful condi
tion in which by tho resumption of sjweiu
payments our lulernal trade and toreigu com
merce may be brought into harmony with the
system of exchanges which is based ujion the
precious metals ns the intrinsic money of tlio
world. In the public judgment that this cud
should bo sought and compassed lis speedily
and securely as the resources of the peojilo
nnd the wisdom of their gov ernmeut cun ac
coinphsu, there is n much greater degree of
unanimity than is found to concur in the siie-
citto measures which will bring the country to
this desired end or tho rapidity of the steps
by which it can be safely reached. Upon n
most anxious and deliberate examination
which I have felt it my duty to give to the
subject, I am but tho more confirmed in the
opinion which I cxjiressed in accepting the
nomination for the Presidency and again upon
my inauguration, that the policy ot resump
tion should be pursued by ever)' suitable
means, and that no legislation would be wise
that should disjuirage the importance or re
tard the attainment of that result. I have no
disiiositiou, no right to ejuestiou the sincerity
or intelligence of opjHising opinions, nml
would neither conceal nor undervalue the con
siderable difficulties and even occasional dis
tresses which may attend tho progress ot the
nation toward this primary condition to its
general and permanent prosperity. I must,
however, adhere to my most earnest convic
tion that any wavering of purjiose or unstead
iness in methods, so far from avoiding or re
ducing the inconvenience insejiarable from
the transition from an irredeemable to a re
deemable paper currency, would only tend to
increased and jtrolonged disturbance iu values,
nnd, unless relieved, must end in serious dis
order, dishonor and disaster iu the financial
affairs of the goverment and of the pcojilo,
Tho mischiefs which I ajipreheud and urgent
ly deprecate are coufiueei to no class of the
peojile, but seem to me most seriously to threat
en the Industrious masses, whether their oev.
cujiations are of skilled or common labor. To
them, it seems to me, it is of prime import
ance that their labor should be couijieusated
in money which is iu itself fixed in exchange
Able value by being irrevocably measured by
tits labor necessary to its production. This

THE SUAEII CJUEsTlON.
I'losclv connected with this general subject
of tho resumption of sjioclo pnymcnta is one
of siibordlnnto but (.till of grnvo linjiortnueo.
I moan tho readjustment of our coinage sys
tem by tho renewal of the silver dollar as im
element in our ppecie currency, endowed by
legislation with tho quality of icgul-teniler to
n greater or lest extent. Am there is no doubt
of the power of Congress under tho Cotistilu.
(ion t, coj lnwy m regulate tho Mil
thereof, and as this power covers the whole
range or authority iijipiiciinio 10 mo menu,
tho rated value and the legal-tender quality
which shall lie adopted for the coinage, the
considerations which should induce or dis
courage a particular measure connected witli
tho coinage belong clearly to the province of
legislative disccntion nnd of public expedien
cy, 'Without intruding upon this province of
legislation in the least. I have yd thought
the subject of such critical importance
in tho actual condition of our affairs ns
to present nn occasion for tlio exercise of tho
duty imposed by the Constitution on the Pres.
ident of recommending to the consideration of
Congress "such measures as lie shall judge
necessary and expedient." Holding the opin
ion, as 1 do, that neither the interest of the
government nor of tlio people, of the United
States would be promoted by disparaging sil.

islation which looks to maintaining the vol.
nine of intrinsic money to ns full n niousurc
of both metal ns their relative commercial
vnlucH will permit would be neither unjust
nor inexpedient, 1 must ask your Indulgence
to n brief nnd definite statement of certain es
Kontial features. I do not propose to enter the
debateiepresented on both sides by such able
disputants in Congress nnd before the people
nnd in the press, ns to the extent to which the
legislation ol nny ono nation can couirui ems
question, even within its own borders, against
the unwritten laws of trade or the positive
laws of other governments. The wisdom of
Congress in shaping any particular law that
may be presented for my approval may w hoi
ly supersede the necessity of my entering into
these considerations, nnd 1 willingly avoid
ither vacuo or Intricate inquiries, ii is only
ccrtnilli ,,!, mui practical featuris of such
ie,,;stiou tnnt desire to recommend to jour
attention. In any legislation providing for a
silver coinage, regulating its value and im
parting to it the quality of legal tender, it
seems to nie of great importance that Con
gress should not lose sight of its notion ns op
erating in ft twofold capacity and in two dis
tinct directions. If the United States govern
ment were free from a public debt, its legisla
tive dealing v Hit tho question of silver coin
age would be purely sovereign anil govern
mental, under no restraints but those of con
stitutional power and the public good ns nf
fected by the proposed legislation i but in the
netunl circumstances of the nation, with nvast
public debt distributed very widely among
our own citizens, and held in great amounts
also abroad, the nature of the silver coinage
measure as nuectiug this relation ot the gov
ernment to the holdtrs of tho public debt be
comes nn element in nny projKised legislation
of the highest concern. The obligation of tho
public faith transcends all nuestions of profit
or public advantage; otherwise its unques
tionable maintenance is the dictate as well 01
iiy congress anil the people auKe.
The ul),ic (lebt of hu Vuiiei sules tI, tut.

tlie eountrv can bo rilieved of these high rates
of iuttri,Kt i by advantageously refunding the
,n.i(.i,ie.ii,eKs. whether the debt is ultimate
ly paid in gold or in silver coin is of but little
moment compared with the possible reduc
tion of interest one-thinl by retuninng 11 ill
such reduced rates. If tho United Statis had
the uiKiuestioned right to liny its Umcls in sil
ver coin the little benefit from that process
would be trreatlv overbalanced by the injuri
ous effect of such payment, if made or pro
posed against the honest convictions of the
public creditors. All tho bonds that ha
been issued since February 1'-', lf-7.",, when
gold became the only unlimited legal tender
metallic currency ot the country, are jusuy
pavable in cold coin, or in coin of equal val
ue. During the time of these issues the only
tlollar that could bo or was received by the
trovemment in exchange for bonds was the
gold dollar. To require the public creditors
to take in repayment any dollar of less com
uiercial value vi ould be regarded by them as
repudiation of the full obligation assumed,
The bouai. isM1(Hi ,,rior lo is;a were issued m
a time when the gold dollar was the only coin
in circulation, or contemplated liy eithirtne
irovernment or the holders ot the Iwmds as the
coin in which they were to be paid. It is far
better to pay these bonds in that coin than to
seem to take advantage of the unforeseen fall
of bilver bullion to pay in ft new issue 01 sil
ver coin thus made so much lets valuable,

less value than that contemplated oy me pur-
ties when the bonds were issued. Any at
tempt to pay tho national indebtedness in
coinage of less commercial value than the
money of the world would unoive a vioiauou
of the public fuith and uorK irreparable inju
ry to the public credit. It was the great lair
it of tho uct of March. IM,'.'. in strengthening
the public credit, that it removed all doubt ns
to the purjiose of the rutted States to pay

cepted as a pledge of public faith. The gov
eminent lias derived great iniieni irom h in
the progress thus far made in refunding the
public debt at low rates ol interest, .vu an
herence to the wise and iust policy of an
act observance of the public faith will ennble
tho government rapidly to nance the burden
of interest on the national debt to an amount
exee-ediug -sLMI.IMHl.tHHI per annum, and eflect
im aggregate saving to the United States of
more than three hundred million dollars be
fore the bonds can bo fully paid. In adaiit
ing the new silver coinage to the ordinary
uses of currency in the every day transactions

tender to be assigned to it, a consideration of
the first importance should no so to adjust me

ev. It is a mixed question for scientific rea
soning uud historie-iil experience to determine
how far and by what methods a practical
eeiuililiriuni can be maintained which will
keep both metals in circulation in their iq-
Iirojiriatu sjiheres of common use. Alt ubsn
ute cipiality of commercial value, free from
disturbing fluctuations, is hardly attainable,
and without it an unlimited legal-tender for
private transactions, aligned to both metals.
would irresistibly tend to drive out oi cireuia
tion the dearer coinage aud disapjioint tin
I principal object proposed by the legislatiot
m view. I apprehend, therefore, that tin
two conditions of n near approach to eeptality
of commercial value between the golel iniil sil
ver coinage of the same denomination, and of
n limitation of the amounts for which the sil
ver coinage is to bo legal tender, are essential
to maintaining both iu circulation. If these
conditions can ,be successfully observed, tho
issue from the mint of silver dollars would af
ford material assistance to the couimiiuity in
the transition to redeemable paper money,
nnd would facilitate the resumption of sjs cie
payment nnd its permanent establishment.
Without theso conditions I ft ar that only mis.
chief and misfortuno would flow from n coin,
age of silver dollars with tho ejuality of un
limited legal tender, even iu private transac
tions. Any expectation of temjiorary ease from
an issue of silver coinage to jmss as n legal
tender at a rate materially above its commer.
cial value is, I am persuaded, a delusion, Xor
can I think that there is any substantial dis.
tiuction between nu original issue of silver
dollars at a nominal value materially above
their commercial value, and the restoration of
the silver dollar at a rate which once was, but
lias ceased to be. its commercial value. Cer
tainly tho issue of gold coinage reduced iu
weight materially below its legal tender value
would not be any the less a jiresent deuasc.
ment of the coinage by reason of its eeiualliug,
or even exceeding, iu weight a gold coinage
which at some past time had been commer
cially equal to the legal tender value assigned
to the new issue. Iu recommending that the
regulation of any silver coinage which may be
authorized by Congress should observe these
conditions of commercial value and limited
legal tender, I am governed by the feeling
that every possible increase should be given
to the volume of metallic money which ran be
kept in circulation, and thereby every possl
bio nld afforded to tho people in tho process
of resuming specio payments. It i.4 because
of my conviction that n disregard of these
conditions would frustrate tho good results
w hieli ftrei desired from the proposed coinngo
and e nibarrass with new elements of coufu
nioii and uncertainty the business of tho coun
try, that I urge upon your attention Iheso con
siderations. I respectfully recommend to
Congress that ill any legislation providing for
n silver coinage and imparting to it the quality
of legal tender, there bo impressed on the
measure a firm provision exempting the pub
lic debt heretofore Issued and now outstand
ing from payment, either of principal or inter
est, in nny coinage of less value than the pris
cnt gold coinage of tho country.

The organization of the civil service of the
country has for n number of years attracted
more and more public attention. So general
has become the opinion Hint the methods of
ndmissinn to it and the conditions of relnnln
ing in it are unsound, that both the great po
litical parties have agreed ill the most explicit
declarations ot tlio necessity 01 reioriu. nuei 111

of the purpose indicated, lteforc my acces
sion to office 1 endeavored to have my own
iews distinctly understood, and upon my in
auguration my accord with the public opinion
was stated 111 terms believed to no plain ami
unambiguous. My experience in tlie Kve eii
the duties has strongly confirmed the belief
in the great advantage the country would find
ill observing strictly the plan of the Constitii
tion which imposes upon the Executive tho
sole duty and responsibility of tho selection of
those officers w ho by law are appointe d, not
'leeted, and which in like manner assigns to
the Senate the- complete right to advise and
ousent to, or .to reject, the nominations so
made, whil- the House of ItcprcsentativoK
stands- as tlie public censor of the performance
of official duties ith the prerngiitiv e of im es-
igatiou and prii-eciitiou in all casi-s ot dere
liction. Tlie bl mishes and imperfections m
the civil striiee may, I think, be traced in
most cases to u practical confusion of the1 du
ties assigned to the several departments of the
Oovemuieiit. My purjiose, in this respect,
has been to return to the system cstabhsheel
by the fundamental law, and to do this with
the heartiest co-operation nnd most tot-dial
understanding with the Senate and House of
llejireseutativcs.
The practical difficulties in th" selection of
numerous officers for jnists of widely varjiug

During the past year the United States
have continued to maintain peaceful relations
with foreign powers. Tho outbreak of war

THE NATIONAL riSANCLS.
The annual report of the Secretary of the
Treasury on the state of the finances jireseuts
imjtortaut questions for the action of Con
gress, ujion some of which I have already re
marked. The revenues of the Government
during the fiscal year ending June ,".tl. Is77.
were i;iii:i.iHHi,..sii.tiL'. in, total txju ma
tures for tho same jieriod were 'j:is.;i;ti,(KS.
!i:i ; leaving a surjiltts ri venue of i:'.!!.:'.!!!,."".-
ti'.t. This has substantially sujijuitsl the re-
luireuteuts of the sinking fund for that year.
The estimated revenues of the current fiscal
year are ir-i"'."'bd.lHHI, and the estimated ex.
jienditures for the wine juries! nre .-s.t'J.tllll..
t,i:i,7-. If these estimates jirove correct,
there will be a surjiltts rev enue of .-;j:i,(n'.!,:t,"t!.-
nn amount nearly snltieient for tlie sink
ing fund of that year. The estimated reve
nues for the next fiscal year are jil'.i.'J.vi.tSHi.
It njijicars from the report that during
the last fiscal year the revenues of the Gov
ernment, conijiured with the previous year,
have largely tlecre-ased. This decrease1, amount
ing to tho sum of tls, IM, !., was mainly on
custom duties, caused largely by a falling off
off the amount of iiuiiorted dutiable goods.
and partly by the general fall of prices in the
markets of production of such articles as jsiy
ad valorem taxes. While this is felt injurious
ly iu the diminution of the revenue, it has
lieen itci-eittqiaitieti wiiu a ere i-trge iiiert-eese-
of exjiortatious. The total cxjiortsduring the
last fiscal year, including coin, have been

(r.l",.'t(. leaving n balance of trade in favor of
the United States amounting to the sum of
.iri,r,.T.i,!U7, tho bencfie'ial effects of which
extend to all branches of business.
Tho estimate d revenue for tin- m-xt fiscal
year will iinjiosu ujioii Congress the duty of
strictly limiting appniprkitions, including the
requisite sum for the maintenance of the sink
ing fund, within tho aggregate estimate of re-
ceijits, v hue the aggregate taxes should not
be increased, niutuduicuts might bo made
to tho revenue laws that would, without di
minishing the revenue, relieve the jieojilo
from unnecessary burdens. A tax on tin aud
coffee is shown by the experience not only of
our own, but of other countries, to be easily
collected without loss by undervaluation or
frautl, and largely borne in the eountrv of
production, A tux of ten cents n jiounet on
tea and two cents cm cotTco would ltrodiice a
revenue exceeding trl'.'.tiiHl.tKKi, and thus en
able Congress to reiieal a multitude of annoy,
ing taxes yielding n revenue not exceeding
that sum, the internal revenue system grew
out of the necessities of the war and most of
the legislation imposing taxes ujiou domestic
jiroduets uuderthis system has been repealed,
lty the substitution of u tux on ten and coffee
all tonus of internal taxation may be repeal.
ed excejit that on whisky, spirits, tobacco and
beer.
Attention is also called to the necessity of
enacting more vigorous uivrsior the ttrotec-
tion of the revenue and for the juiiiishnieut
of frauds and smiiggliug. litis can best be
dono by judicious provisions that will induce
the disclosure of utteinjitcd fraud by under,
vuluution aud smuggling. All revenue laws
should be simple in their jirovisious nnd easi
ly understood. So far as tiracticable the rates
of taxation should bo iu the form of specific
duties and not nd valorem, retiuiriug the
judgment of experienced men to ascertain
values and cxjio.ing the revenue to the teuijs.

My attention has been called during the ro.

of tlio customs laws, to which the nttcntlou ot

With my sanction the Secretary of tho Treas

nfter the popular subscrilition fur such bonds
was ojiened, subscrijitions were had, amotint-

that suitable provision be made to uiable the

iblic policy to retain among our own people
the securitie s eif the United States. In this way
our country is guarded against their sudden
rituni from foreign countries, caused by war
or other disturbances bi'viind our limits.
J he commerce of the I lilted Mates Willi
foreign nations and especially the ciliort
of domestic productions, has of kite years
large ly increased, but the greutcr jsirtion of
this tnidc Is coiuliiittd in foreign vessels. The
iiisjiortance or enlarging our foreign trade,
and e sjieci.illy by direct nnd sjieedy inter.
change' with countries on this continent etui
not be overestiiunteel. and it is a matte r of
great moment that our own shipping Interest
should receive, to the utmost practical extent,
the benefit of our commerce with other lmds.
These e-ousidi rations arc forcibly urged by nil
the large commercial cities, njttl public nttcn-
tion is generally and wisely attracted to ine
solution of the problem they jiresent. It is
no! doubted that Congress will take the tu ui

The ven serious riots which oe'curml in

these eiistuibiiue-cs were so formidable as to
defy the les-al and State authorities., and the
National Uxiiutive was called upon 111 tl

to furnish military aid. I inn gratified to lie-
able to state that the troops sent in resjHinso

Congress is empowered bv the Constitution
with the authority of exclusive legislation
over tho District of Columbia, in which tho
scat of government of the nation is located.
The interests of the District, having no direct
rejiresentatioii iu Congress, nre entitle il to is.
Jiccial consideration and care nt the hands of
tho general government. The cajiital of the
United mates belongs to tho nation, anil it is
natural that the American jieojilo should take
pritie in tho seat of their national govern
ment and desire it to be nil ornament to their
country. Much has been done to render it
healthful, convenient nud attractive. but much
remains to be done which its jiermanent in
habitant are not able and ought not to be
oxjiecte-d to do. To imjiose ujiou them a
large Jirojiortion of tlio cost required for Jiuli
lic iuijiroiemetits, which are in a great nic-as-tire
jilanned and executed for the convenience
of the Government, and of tho many thous
ands of visitors from all tarts of the country
who leiutionirily reside at the cajiital of tho
Iintion, is nn evident injustice. SjK-cial at

eminent, nud of the outlay for nil needed
jmblic imjirot omenta, and such measure of
relief from the burden of taxation now rest
ing on the Jieojilo of the District as in the
wisdom of Congress may bo deemed just.
The rejiort of the commissioners shows that
the nuairs of the Distnct nre in n condition
ns satisfactory ns could be exjiected iu view
of the heavy debt resting ujhju it and its very
limited mmns for necessary exjienscs. Ihe
debt of the District is ns follows t Old fund-

The Commissioners also nsk attention to
the imjiortaiice of the improvement of the
Potomac river and the reclaiming of the
marshes Isirderiifg the city of Washington,
and their views ujKm this subject are concur
red in by the mt lube rs of the board of health,
whose rejiort is also herewith transniitteek
lloth the commercial and sanitary interests of
the District will be greatly jiromoted, I doubt
not, by this improvement.
Your attention is invited to the suggestions
of the commissioners of the boanl of health
for the organization of a lioanl of charities to
have sujiervision and control of the disburse
ment of all moneys for charitable jmriHjses
from the District treasury. I desire also to
ask your osjs-cial attention to the need of
adding to the efficiency of the- jmblic schools
of the District by supplemental aid from the
national treasury. This is i-sjiecially just,
since so large a number of those attending
the schools are children of the c-injiloycs of
the Government.
I earnestly commend lo your tare the in.
te rests of the people of the District, who are
so intimately associated with the Goverauient
establishment, and to whose e-uterjirise tlie
gooel order and attractiveness of the capital
are kirge-ly tluc ; and I nsk your attention to
the request of tho commissioners for legisla.

their care. The ajqirojiriatious asked for the
care of the reservations belonging to the Gov
ernment within the city by the Commissioner
of Public llitildiugs and Grounds are also
commended to vottr favorable- consideration.
The rejiort of the joint commission create d
by the act ajiprovesl August 2, 18711, entitled
"An act jirovieiing for the c-omjvhtion of the
Washington monument." is also herewith
transmitted, with nccomjianyiug documeuts.
The lioanl of engineers' officers detailed to
examine the lnouuineut iu coiujilinncc with
the second section of the act have reiiorttsl
tluit the foundation is Insufficient. No nu.
thority exists for making the exjienditures
necessary to secure its stability. 1 therefore
recommend that the comuiLssiri be nuthor
izeel to e-xjieud such jKirtiou of the sum'ajv
jirojinate'cl by the act as may be uece-MJirj- for
the jiurjiose. The jinseut unfinished condi
tion of the monument, begun so long ago, is
a rejiroach to the nation. It cannot be doubt
ed that the juitriotic sense of the country will
warmly resjioud to such jiroinjit jirovision ns
may lie made tor its comjiietiou at an cany
day. and 1 urge upou Congress the propriety
and necessity of iuiutediate legishttiou for this
Jill 1-j Kse.
THE I'UBLIC EDUCATION.
The wisdom of legiskvtion on the jiart of
Congress iu aid of the States for the educa
tion of the whole peoiile in those branches ol
study which are taught In the common schools
of the country is no longer a ejuestiou. 1 he
intelligent judgment of the country goes still
further, regarding it ns both constitutional
and eijiedieut for the general government to
extend to the technical and "higher education
such aid as is decerned essential to the general
welfare and to our due imminence nmoug the
enlightened and cultured nations of the world.
The ultimate settlement of all questions of
the future, whether of administration or fi
nance, or of tnto nationality of sentiment
dejieuds ujiou the virtue aud intelligence of
the people. It is vain to hope for the success
of a free- government without the means of
insuring the intelligence of those who are the
source of liower. No less tliau one-seventh
of the entire voting juijiulation of our country
are yet unable to read and write, it is en.
couraging to observe in connection witn tne
grow th of fraternal feeling iu those States iu
which slavery formerly existesl evidences of
increasing interest iu universal education, and
I shall be glad to giv e my npjiroval to any
aiipropriato measures which may be enacted
by Congress for the purpose of supplement
ing with national aid tno local systems ot ed
ucatiou in those States and iu all tho States :
aud luiving already invited your attention to
the needs of the District of Columbia with re
spect to its jiuhlic school system, I here add
that I lielieve it desirable, not so much with
reference to the local wants of the District,
but to the great aud lasting lieuefit of the en
tire country, that this system should be
crowned with a university in all resjiects in
keeping with the national capital, and there
by realize the cherished hojies of Washington
on this subject.
nECOMMENUATIONS.
I also earnestly commend tho reejttest of the
regents of the Smithsonian Institute that au
adequate apjiropriation be made for the es
tablishment nnd conduct of a national muse
um under their supervisiou. The reejuest of
providing for the jireservatiou and growth of
tho library of Congress is also one of national
importance. As the dejiositorv of all copy
right jiublications and records this library Las
outgrown the jirovisious tor its occoiunioeta-
tion, nnd tho erection, on such site as the
judgment of Congress may approve, of a fire-
jiroof building to preserve the treasure aud
enlarge tho usefulness of tho valuable collec
tion is recommended. I recommend, also,
such legislation as will render available aud
efficient for the jiurjiose of instnictiou, so far
as is consistent with the public service, the
cabinets or museums of invention, of educa
tion, of agriculture, and other collections, the
nronertv of the national government. The
cajiital of the nation should be something
more than a mere jwlitical centre. Wo should
avail ourselves of all the ojqiortunities which

The long struggle for tiartv sujireiuacy in
the Senate closed last Friday night with the
seating of Kellogg over Sjiofford from Louisi
ana, aud Butler over Corbiu from South Caro
lina the Democrats having been finally forc
ed to accejit the jiroposition made by Mr. Ed
muuds to vote on the Kellogg case first and
the Duller case second. On the ejuestiou of
admitting Kellogg, Couover and Patterson
lioth voted with the ltejiublicaus aud Davis of
Illinois with the Democrats. On admitting
Duller, Patterson and Conover voted with the
Democrats and Davis did not vote. Mr.
Davis either dodged or voted with the Demo
crats on every motion made during the week's
contest. This issue of the struggle virtually
amounts to a comjiromise or drawn battle, as
it leaves the jiarties balanced jirecisely as they
were before, that is with two majority for the
ltejiublicaus (311 Rejmblicans and 37 Demo
crats I, w hen Conover and Patterson v ote with
the Ilepublicaus, as they are likely to continue
to do, now that they have secured the admis
sion of Duller.
The extra sv'ssiou closed shortly before
noon on Monday, nothing of special iiujior-
tance transpiring beyond the confirmation of
several executive nominations by the Senate.
The regular session convened at noon, and
the President's message was read iu both
branches, an adjournment being taken there
after, in the Senate until Thursday, and in
tho House until Tuesday, when that body
jiassed bills, without njmosition, repealing
the "irou-clad oath, nud tho sectiou of the
revised statutes which makes jiarticijintion iu
the rebellion a ground for challenge of jurors

In tho seven weeks of tho extra session
nearly 1MM bills were introduced iu the
House aud referred to tho committees. The
only bills that jiassed Isitli houses and became
laws were the army approjiriatiou bill for the
current year and tho naval dsfte-ieucy bill.

and scut to tho Senate, but received no con
