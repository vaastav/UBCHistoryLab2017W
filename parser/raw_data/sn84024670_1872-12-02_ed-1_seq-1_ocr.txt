AFTERNOON SESSION.
Tho Convention mot at 5 o'clock, tho
President being kept away nntil that hour
by indisposition.
Mr. Keeler asked an explanation ofthe
word " lien," ns used in tho resolution.
Colonel Ruffin said tho object of tho reso
lution is to get the Legislature to pass a
law giving tho merchants a collateral in the
future for advances they make to the
farmer.
Colonel Oochraue, of Culpeppor, fol
lowed in a brief speech, advocating the
adoption of tho resolution, and the passage
of the lien law by the Legislature. lie
hoped the President would exercise great
prudence in the appointment of the com
mittee. It would have to digest the plans
tad details of the law proposed.
Mr. Ragland, of Halifax, here roso and
requested, in order to facilitato business,
that the chair enforce the rule of the Con
vention that no member shall speak moro
than ten minutes, or more thnn twice on
one subject. Ho thought that the
man who cannot strike oi! in ten minutes
is boring with a very bad auger. Mr.
Ragland expressed himself as entirely op- ;
posed to a lien law. The farmer has too
much credit now. It would bo belter for
him if he had less or none. No law is
right that would give one class of citizens |
pre-emption over another class.
Judge Mann, of Nottoway, said that be- i
fore the Legislature is memorialized to '
pass a law for the protection of the mer- '
chants, tho farmers should have some guar
antee of protection in this—that ho will got
fertilizers that aro worth something. They
sometimes pay high prices for fertilizers
from which they never renlizo any benefit. I
He hoped the resolution would not pass in '
its present form.
Mr. Keeler moved that, tho further con
sideration of this subject be postponed un
til the next meeting of the Council.
The Convention then adjourned nntil 7| I
o'clock. i
NIGHT SESSION. '
Convention was called to order nt V*
o'clock.
Mr. John Dodson, of Dinwiddie county,
presented the following as tho
IfEPORT OF TOE COMMITTEE ON IMMI
GRATION.
Tho committee, to whom was referred
lb- following resolutions, to wit:
RESOLUTIONS.
Whereas, It is necessary to have some .
union for a plan or chorter tor the organiza- ,
tion of land and immigration companies in
tho respective counties of Virginia and .
Nerth Carolina,
Resolved, That a committee of seven be i
appointed by tho chair to draft such char
ter, to be submitted to an adjourned meet- |
ing of this Convention, said committeo to i
have power to fill vacancies in its own
body. i
Resolved, That said committee be hereby (
empowered to digest somo plan for a regis- |
t.r, an officer who shall bo the central and
State authority to present and make sale of (
..uch land as may no subscribed by respec- (
tive county organizations to non-resident ]
immigrants and actual settlers on such t
land, which digested plan shall also be sub- j
mittcd to the adjourned meeting of this
Convention.
Dr. Rives spoke iv support of a State
Board of Immigration, without which he J
argued all efforts would fail.
Dr. George Rives offered the following: '
Resolved, That the committee be author- J
ized to memorialize tho Legislature at its J
next session, in the nauio of this Conven- '
tion, to onact such a law as will accomplish '
• his vital object.
Mr. Wright, of Nansemond, submitted l
Hie following: _
Kesolved, That the committee vooom- '
mend to all tho counties in Virginia tho
formation of settlers' and immigration so- '
cieties auxiliary to the present immigra- '
tion aid society at Norfolk.
Your committee have had the subject '
referred to them under consideration, and
have prepared an act accompanying this
report, and recommend its adoption.
The subject under our consideration your |
committee regard as of vital importance and
arefully sensible of the difficulties of present- (
ing a plan for the effective promotion of im- j
migration freo from defects—yet they feel ,
satisfied that with the aid, the experience ,
and intelligence of tho Convention this act
now submitted may effect great success.
This subject has for several years occu- ,
pied the public attention, in various forms
-of land companies and immigration svsso- |
tciatieni, but without any marked success.
In fact, so far from tho success desired,
many of the plans of land agencies and
associations have created a positive mis- i
trust ia the minds of land purchasers to
remedy this mischief and avoid the errors I
of the past. The plan now submitted not i
ouly ignores all purposes of speculation,
but gives assurance to all land purchasers,
whether from our sister States or abroad,
that the opportunities tendered them for
the purchase and settlement of our lands
ore for their direct social and material ad
vantage, and incidentally benoflcial to the
present land owner by the increased value
of his remaining lands, dependent upon the
immigrant's success. To do this it was
accessary that the lands offered should be
at a low, fixed and unalterable price, bring
ing this plan as near as practicable to the
Public Land System of .ie United States,
with which immigrants are most familiar.
In regard to that feature of tho subject
looking to the creation of a Central State
Register by authority of tho Legislature,
in our opinion it is impolitic, uncertain
and impracticable, and we havo therefore
recommended a central agency to be ap
pointed by the respective county organi
zations, at all times under tho supervi
sion of such organizations, and thus avoid
ing the delays and uncertainties of legisla
tion.
In accord-moo with tho resolution of the
Convention, tho act provides that tho hinds
shall be purchased only by non-resident
actual settlers. Your committee regarded
thia provision as essential to success.
Without it the whole plan would be unas
certained.
It will be observed that the terms Immi
gration and Immigrant have been substi
tuted by this term l__id Purchasers,
To tlie casual observer this change may be
regarded as immaterial—upon examination
and with a free conference with intelligent
foreigners now resident in Southside Vir
ginia and large land purchasers, wo are
satisfied of the impjrtanco of adopting tho
'crm Land Purchase. Iv Sco»l"nd, Eng
hnd an lon tho Continent, t! . I<m Im
migrant is looked upon with pi .j..dice and
repulsion by the class of people who have
some means and seek new homes. Whether
this feeling bo right or wrong it is not for
us to determine, but being assured of this
fact, it is judicious to avoid any terms to
which any portion of the population wo
invite to make Virginia their home have an
aversion, i'ot we need and will welcome
every essential industrious laborer—indeed
all who will come to co-operate with us in
restoring Virginia and North Carolina to
prosperity and happiness.
We are gratified to team that the Allan
line of steamers from Norfolk to Liverpool
are attracting increased numbers of immi
grants over their line. Their generous
ofTer of their agents abroad, freo of costs,
to circulate information to induce land-pur
chasers to Virginia, will be a valuable co
operative influence to advance our cause.
We havo provid_.il, therefore, for a discre
tionary power in our land companies to
contribute aid to the Immigrant and Set
tlers' Aid Society, connected with the
Allan line.
The act of incorporation of land compa
nies in the respective counties of Virginia.
If our efforts on this subject shall prove
in any degree useful to the Convention our
services will be amply rewarded. Your
committee ask to bo discharged from tho
consideration of this subject now reported.

The was received and adopted,
and the committee discharged.
Dr. Briggs stated that an Immigrant and
Aid Society has been organized in Nanse
mond county, and steps taken for the intro
duction of English laborers and their fami
lies in tho county. The Allan lino of
steamships is co-operating heartily with
all organizations looking to the introduc
tion of immigrants into Virginia.
Mr. Prince, of Southampton, said that
while we should give every oncouragement
to immigration, there is another subject
that should equally engage our attention,
and that is emigration. Wo should use
every ondeavor to keep our sons at home.
He would not give one native Virg nian for
two or three immigrants.
Mr. Logan said the older he gots, with
the moro emphasis he can sing "Old V ir
ginia Never Tire." There is no country on
earth like Virginia. If wo can keep our
own people Rt homo our patch will be the
best patch of all.
[Governor Walker here camo in and was
received with great applause.)
ELECTION OF OFFICERS.
.Major Dromgoole offorod the following
resolution:
Resolved, That tho President be author
ized to appoint five suitable persons, three
of whom shall bo residents of Petersburg,
whose business it shall be to perform the
duties of tho Executive Committo under
the constitution.
Resolved, That tho President bo further
authorized to appoint a treasurer, clerk
and corresponding secretary to act with tho
regular election in November, 1873.
Mr. Logan moved to amend, by election
by the Council, instead of appointment by
the President.
Mr. Uinlon moved as a substitute, that
a committeo of three, with Mr. Logan as
chairman, be appointed to report officers
for the Convention to-day.
Tho substitute was adopted, and the
chair appointed tho following gentlemen to
cotrpose the committee: Mr. Logan, of
Ronnoko ; Colonel G. W. Bolling, of Pe
tersburg, and Major R. L. Ragland, of Hal
ifax.
THF FINANCES OF THE CONVENTION.
Mr. Dromgoolo said there is not a dollar
in tho treasury of the Convention, while its
liabilities are heavy. He proposed to raise
the means to meet the expenses, and to go
at once to business; he would bo one of
fifty to give 85. Among other expenses is
the rent of the hall. Many responses wore
mado.
Major J. A. Johnston, on behalf of tho
citizens of Petersburg, tendered the
Academy of Music to the Convention free
of charge.
On motion of Mr. Montgomery, of
Greensville, the thanks of tho Convention
wero tendered tho citizens of Petersburg
for their generous offer to pay the rent of
the hall.
an appeal to the railroads.
Mr. John Dodson offered tho following :
Resolved, Tbfft the railroad companies of
this State and North Carolina be and they
aro hereby earnostly appoaled to to extend
every facility in their power, but especially
by reduced rates of fare, to encourage
travel in our midst of all persons who de
sire to examine lands, with a view .o pur
chasing, and to givo the benefit of such
reduction to their families when removing
to occupy such lands.
Upon this resolution Mr. Dodson said
he would like to hear Governor Walker.
gov. walker's speech.
Gov. Walker came forward amidst much
applause and spoke as follows :
Mr. Chairman and Gentlemen: As I
have heard but little of the resolution and
scarcely know to what it refers—l must
beg to bo excused from speaking to it. 1
was surprised, on entering the hall, to find
that I was billed for a speech on immigra
tion. I was innocent as a child of any such
intention. I came here because I was anx
ious to learn something of tho interests and
wants of tho farmers, and supposed I could
learn this best by listening to your discus
sions. 1 regret that I was not hero earlier
to have heard ycur views on immigration.
I have thought of the subject and studied
much. In my last message to the Legisla
ture, I laid before that body a plan for the
encouragement of immigration. But tho
Legislature did nothing; other matters en
grossed its attention. It will assemble
again next month, and if you will it, your
voico will bo respected and somo action
taken.
We have not one quarter the population
in Virginia that we ought to have. Igo
heart and soul for keeping our young men
at homo, but wo want others to help us
build up tho Commonwealth. Tie im
portance of immigration is generally con
ceded, and it is not necessary tor me to
say anything on this subject. As I came
in tho door the gentleman from Roanoke
county (Mr. Logan) was speaking. I heard
him say that ho was opposed to general
immigration—an omnium gatherum to
overrun the State. I agree with him. We
want no pauper immigrants nor others to
bieak dowu Virginia. We con keep that
■ class out. What we want is honest,
industrious, thrifty citizens, who will
t come and improve and build up our lands.
i These we can easily obtain both from the
; North and from Europe. But there ar.
• difficulties which must be met. We have
I no Government lands. Most immigrants
i ro Wost. They havo every assistance ren
. dertd thorn, both in Europe and New York,
. and when they get in tho West they find
cheap lands at (iovcrnmeut prices, and
i have no difficulty in locating. It is not
■ ossontial for us of the South to organizo
• such a system, but them aro essentials
, that cannot bo overlooked. Immigrants
i aro coming here, but too gradually to do
i much good. Private enterprise does much,
but not enough.
Tho first essential is : Correct informa
tion, sent in proper form, to bo recognized
wherever sent. While recognizing the
value of privato enterprise in this respect,
there is no doubt that it has also done
much injury at times. The proper statis-
tics, showing advantages—and wo havo
greater advantages than any other State in
the Union—should be published. Our fa
cilities to market, by rail and boat, render
our lands cheaper by one-half than in o'her
States. Such statistics should go abroad
by State authority, and they would every
where be recognized and acted upon.
The second essential is that some provi
sions or plan be devised by which immi
grants, when they arrive here, can find ft
homo without hunting tho State over and
then probably having difficulty iv purchas
ing the land he wants. This is a serious
difficulty. The people of Virginia, like
those of the old country, havo a strong love
for their homes—and generally are disin
clined to sell. But still there is much land
for sale. All such land should be placed,
and its advantages given so that the immi
grant may really be located before he gets
here ; and if the representations made to
him hold good, he settles down at once.
I would like for the farmers of this Con
vention to devise somo plan to meet all
these difficulties. We want system in the
information as to tho location, character
and piices of our lands—to aid tho immi
grant in finding a home. With this infor
mation scattered abroad, and our facilities
of locating them with ft good lino of steam
ers to bring them to our shores—we can
bring into our Stato from three to five
hundred desirable immigrants per month.
The steerage passage by the Allen lino
bring .00 each. If wo could bring three to
five hundred industrious, skilful men, with
a capital of XSOO each, what an effect it
would havo upon our State. I beg you to
let your action bo practical.and it will result
in great good to the State. We are in a
peculiar position, and the crisis is not yet
passed. Men like you can give tone to pub
lic sentiment, if you act properly. Ques
tions aro now comirg up in the civil gov
ernment, in which you should have a voice,
for what affects tho interests ofthe country
affects yours also.
At tho conclusion of Governor Walker's
speech the resolution was aaopted.
PKOPOSED BUREAU OF AGRICULTURE
AND IMMIGRATION.
Dr. Briggs offered the following:
Resolved, That we recommend tho pres
ent Register of Land Office bo changed
into a Bureau of Agriculture, Immigration
and Statistics, with such additional legisla
tion as may make it effectual iv dissemi
nating information abroad for tho purpose
of aiding agriculture and immigration.
It was unanimously adopted.
Colone. G. W. Bolling moved that ther
President of this Convention communicate
tho above resolution to the Legislature.

A CARD.
The undersigned having been favored
with an opportunity of witnessing experi
ments by Prof. E. P. [lowland and exam
ining his illustrative apparatus, take groat
pleasure in recommending his lectures to
the public.
His collection of instruments in new,
very extensive, ofthe best quality, and tho
most perfect construction. His objects
arc exquisitoly prepared and cmbraco
a wide variety of the most interesting sub
jects in natural science. His acquaint
ance with his subject is minute an 1 tho
rough, giving to his experiments and exhi
bitions accuracy and certainty. His mode
of illustration by thorough illuminated ob
jects, largely magnified upon a screen, cap
tivates the attention and fixes ideas strong
ly in tho mind. Scientific subjects thus
treated reveal to tho cyo wonders and
beauties more marvellous than Action.
Tho microscope and the spectroscopo, aided
by tho electric, light, relieve seier.o
of all dryness, and invest it
with tho charms of romance. The best i
educated persons as well as tho general ■
public will find these lectures worthy if I
their patronage. Let those who really "de- I
sire to elevate the character of our public I
amusements avail themselves of this chance ,
to show their sincerity. Tho Richmond i
Lecture Association havo started out with
th. determination to furnish first-class en
tertainments, combining every element of i
healthful and innocent delight to tho eleva- i
tion of the popular taste. They do I
this in the interest of education
and the public welfare. There are enough
people in this city who profess to regard
i hese objects to make this effort a splendid j
success, and fruitful of great f ature good. .
Will they not, for the sake of their children
and youth especially, enter warmly in this
good work. By making our first course a j
success, we shall enuure succeeding lectures
by the most distinguished scienti«ts and ,
scholars in tho country.

Church Notes.—Notwithstanding the
severity of tho weather, many of our
churches were well attended yesterday. !
We havo heard complaints that some of '
these edifices aro rather comfortless since '
cold weather set in, and we refer to the '
rratter simply in the interest of tho con- '
gregations.
Broad-street Sunday-school was yesterday j
the scene of a very affecting and interesting I
episode. Immediately after the lessons oi !
the school wore over, Dr. Edwards, who \
has been pastor of the church and a con- i
stant attendant in tho school for tho past !
four years, but who has been assigned to <
another field, mado a short address to the <
officers, teachers and scholars, referring iv <
earnest terms to their duty to their new
pastor and to each other. At tho close of
his remarks, tho superintendent of J
tho school rose and addressed the
reverend gentleman in a feeling and touch
ing speech, and at the conclusion presented '
him with a handsome gold chain and watch- l
fob, on behalf of tho entire school. The
Doctor was completely taken by surprise, t
and so much affected that he could scarcely j
find words to respond. A beautiful charm,
attached to the chain, bears tho name of ,
the beloved pastor and also that of tho i
school in which ho has so long labored. ,
The semi-annual meeting of the Presby
terian Sunday-school Union was held at ]
the Grace-street church yesterday after- 1
noon, at .._• o'clock, 0. ft. Barksdale, of
tho Second church, presiding. Excellent
addresses were delivered by Asa Snyder,
of tho .Methodist, and Dr. Dickinson, of
the Baptist churches. Tho music was con
ducted by Mr. Sleight. No statistical re
ports were presented. A verbal report by •
Mr. Sleight showed the schools to bo in a
very flourishing condition. Tho meeting
was au exceedingly interesting one.
Rev. J. W. Sydnor, of Nottoway, j
preached an excellent sermon last night in ;
the Second Baptist church, and after tho '
regular services were concluded, the Rev, '
0.0. Bitting, tho pastor, baptized five ,
persons—two ladies and three gentlemen.
Rev. Dr. Chandler, of Maryland, deliv
ered a fine missionary address in the Mon- .
umental church yesterday morning. The
services throughout were highly interesting
and impressive, the music, as usual, form
ing a notable feature. Tho performances
of the Monumental choir aro always unex
ceptionable. The only improvement we
could venture to suggest would bo tho more
frequent introduction of new music.

Dhawino it Very Fine.—The tax
bill passed by the last session of tbe Vir
ginia Legislature is, it seems, whether so
intended by our Solons or not, susceptible
of a very flno construction. It seems to
come down to a dot upon that class of
ladies and gentlemen who would make an
honest per cent, by soliciting subscribers
to newspapers and other periodicals pub
lished in our own State. Tho law has been
so construed in one case, we aro credibly
informed, as to make such solicitors liable
to tho retail newsdealers' tax, and a lady
who waß procuring subscribers to the Re
ligious Herald was the victim.

PRESIDENTS MESSAGE
READ BEFORE CONGRESS TO-DAY
A FULL SYNOPSIS
♦ —
IMPORTANT RECOMMENDATIONS
THE LATE ARBITRATION AND BOUND
ARY QUESTIONS.
Washing/on, December 2.—After a short
recess the President's Message was at 1:40
received and read. It commences with a
recognition of tho blessings which the
American people have enjoyed within the
past year, the only exception being the
great fire in Boston. Tt refers to the
Geneva Arbitration and its satisfactory re
sults which left the two governments of
America and England without a shadow on
their friendly relations, which it ia sincerely
hoped may forever remain equally uncloud
ed. It recommends the immediate creation
of a board of commissioners to decide on
the amounts to be paid to individuals. It
complimonts Mr. Adams and Mr. Bancroft
for their eminent services in the matter
of the Geneva and San Juan arbitrations.the
decisions in the latter leaving thi» United
States for the first time without any case
as to disputed boundaries.
THE TREATY OP WASHINGTON--VIEN
NA EXPOSITION.
In regard to the fisheries and our relations
with the British North American provinces
tho President says that ho has received
netice that the Imperial Parliament and
the Dominion Government had passed laws
to carry tho provisions of the Treaty of
Washington into operation, and he there
fore recommend legislation by Congress
in the same direction. Ho speaks of the
friendly relations of tho United States
with all the Governments of Europe. He
refers to tho Vienna International Exposi
tion, and recommends the fitting up of two
national vessels to convey the goods c f ex
hibitors to Trieste, and suggests that appro
priation be made to have the next.
?reat exposition in this country, in 1576, at
the time of the Centonnial Celebration in
Philadelphia.
Till. WAR IN CUBA.
He refers to the disturbed condition of
-flairs in Cuba, and says that no advance
towards pacification in that island has been
made, while the insurr.ction had gained no
advantages and exhibited no more of the
elements of power or prospective success
than a year ago ; neither had Spain suc
;eeded in repressing the insurrection. The
jarties to the strife wero standing
i the same attitude as for a long
ime past. The continuation of
slavery in that island ho regards
imong tho strongest causes of the con
iuuance of strife, and he thinks that the
tbolitiou of slavery and the institution of
ither reforms thero could not fail to ad
'auco the restoration of peace and order.
it was greatly to bo hoped that the present
lberal government of Spain will voluntarily
idopt that view.
CniNA AND JAPAN.
Referring to our relations with China and
Japan, tho President recomonds provison
or maintaining four American youths in
sach of tho countries as part of tho diplo
matic family of ministers.
REVENUE AXD TAXATION.
He gives details of revenue received in
the past year, and of a reduction to amount
sf over ono hundred million of public debt.
He expresses a doubt whether any fur
ther reduction in taxation is practicable for
tho present, and he recommends that no
more legislation be had on that subject, ex
sept to correct errors of omission or com
mission in tho present laws, until sufficient
time shall have elapsed to prove that it ca i
be done and still leave sufficient revenue to
meet current expenses, pay intertst on
public debt, and provide for sinking fund.
He suggests also the currency shall be
as soon as possible brought to n par with
.old.
OUR WATER LINES.
He says that various enterprises will be
brought to the attention of Congress for
the cheapening of transportation of pro
luce from the West to tho Atlantic sea-
Mast, and suggests that steps should be
taken to gain all available information to
ensure equitable and judicious legislation.
In this connection he refers favorably to the
proposed route to connect the Mississippi
Valley with the Atlant o at Charleston
and Savannah, by way of tho Ohio and
Tennessee rivers ; also to the proposed ex
tension of tho Kanawha and James river
canal, and tho Chesapeake and Ohio
canal, and to tho proposed canal around
Niagra Falls. Ho says that thoro should
be an almost continuous system of land
navigation from Maine to tho Gulf ol
Mexico; nature having provided a greater
part of tho route, and the obstacles to be
overcome being within the skill of engineers.
THE NAVY.
He calls attention to the weakness of the
American navy, and endorses the recom
mendations of the Secretary of the Navy
in that respect. Ho recommends subsidies
for steamship lines to Brazil, and between
San Francisco, New Zealand and Australia
also, and increase of salaries of heads of
Bureaus.
THE FRANK.
He favors the abolition of the franking
privilege, and recommends a modification
of the existing evils.
POSTAL TELEGRAPH.
He also recommends the adoption by
Congress of the best method of acquiring
the title to all telegraph lines now in ope
ration, and of the connection of that ser
vice with the postal service. It is not
probable that the subject can receive prop
er consideration at this session, but he
thinks the movoment might be initiated so
that future action may bo had—fair to the
Government and te the private parties con
cerned.
THE CARRYING TRADE.
He calls attention to the alarming falling
off in tho American carrying trade, and
says that a yearly expenditure of flvo mil
lion dollars for the next five y eui's to restore
that trade would be a profitable invest
ment.
LET V- HAVE PEACE,
Referring to tho Ku-klux outr_£es r tk_
ircsiaeut expressed his conviction that the
time is not far distant when the obvious
advantages of good order and peaco will
induco an abandonment of all such combi
nations and when it will be unnecessary to
carry on prosecutions or to inflict punish
ment in order to protect citiiens from the
lawless doings of such combinations.
Ho makes suggestions in regard to tlio
Indians ; that they shall all be confined to
the territory south of Kansas, and th
farms bo secured to them in fee and in sev.
entity.
census in 1875.
He recommend* that a further census
be taken in 1875, but no reapportionment of
members of Congress be made under it. In
only one of the territories, Utah, is the con
dition of affairs regarded by the President
as unsatisfactory. It hacf seemed to be
the policy of tho Utah Legislature to evadu
all responsibility to the government of the
-mted States, and even to hold a position
hostile to it.
rOLYQAMY, &C.
He recomm.uus acarelul revision of the
present laws and tho enactment of laws
that will secure peace, the equality of all
citizens before the law, and tho ultimate
extinguishment of polygamy.
He recommends an appropriation to re
imbur_e the city of Washington for work
done in front of the public reservations and
for embellishment of the publio buildings
and grounds.
CENTENNIAL.
He favors action to give greater eclat and
success to the observance of the Centennial
Anniversary of American Independence.
CIVIL SERVICE.RULE..
In regard to civil service, he says thai
he will carry out the rules during his term
of office, but suggests that there should be
direct action of Congress to make the sys
tem binding on his successors so as to se
cure to the public service a practical meth
od of obtaining faithful and efficient offi
cers and employees.
The reading of the message was com
pleted at 2:50 o'clock, having occupied one
hour and ten minutes.
