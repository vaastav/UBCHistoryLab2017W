IKE A CRAZY QUILT
SAYS JUDGE GROSSCUP OF
ROOSEVELT'S MESSAGE.
JAP QUESTION HOT FOR PRESIDENT
Chicago Jurist Asserts Legislature
Alone Should Act Attacks Sim
plified Spelling.
niUtlmorc, Dec. li. JiulRe Peter
Stonier Qiyirscup, of Chlcnu, Is spend
lug a fow (lus in llnltlmuie, ns the
guest of John M. ItlnnUenshlp, super
intendent of llio .Meichnnts' and Min
ers' Transportation Co. When nsUotl
for his opinion of the iiicsriikc of 1'rus
Ident Hoosevelt to congtess, Judge
Orostcup tepllcd.
"It's like n crazy quilt. It covers
nlmoql every pos-tlblo subject, nnd
many of thrni me hardly important
enough for n president's massage. It
Fecms to me," continued the Judge,
ultli a laugh, "that the question of
pioUilliig sclioolliuv gallcrios for school
chlldien nilt?lit snfely have been left
to the school diiertors.
"The trouble with the mossugo Is
that It is out of proportion. Uttle
things are placet! side by side with
big ones, and all are treated from a
preaching attitude. Tho president
himself has no sense of proportion.
'lie thinks everything under tho
sun that Interests him Is Important
enough to be put In a message to
congress. Tiidei stand me, I nm not
raying anything which conveys the
kast feeling against him. Ills great
power with the people Is held by his
lntcnso sincerity."
After reading what President Uooso
vclt had to say on the Jnpaneso ques
tion, Judge Orosscup said:
"That Is a question for tho legis
lature. The national gorcrnmont has
no right to make a treaty that will in
terfere with the regulation oC schools
by a state."
Judge Orosscup's nttontlon was call
ed to tho claim of the Japanese that
under the treaty with tho United
States their citizens arc entitled to
the same treatment as those of the
"most favored nation," and that tho
public school prlvllego therefore
should be theirs. He then paid:
"So far as tho treaty Is concerned,
It Is the old question of a contract
mode with an ngont. The agents'
powers should be closoly understood.
In this case the United States govern
ment Is only the agent, and In the
treaty or contract thore should have
been a clause Inserted preventing con
flict with state laws over which the
government has no power.
"Just what Hip president means
when he says ho will uso nil tho forces
of the United States, military and civil,
which he may lawfully employ In tho
matter affecting the' Japanese, I do
not know.
"It Is the old trouble with Roosevelt:
lie tecommeuds a thing In a general
way, but does uot make clear tho de
tails. ' Has he used simple spelling In tho
message? It Is a monstrosity. Those
of us who were educated In old and
fiirt English do not care for the new
way or arranging letters. I see the
fiuprcmo court has 'lefusod briefs
spelled In that way. Their action
speaks for the bench."
SHIP LOST; CAPTAIN FREEZES.
Another Vessel On Coast Only Saved
By Being Beached.

Tokyo, Dec. C The clear, firm and

Itoosovelt In his message in regard to

thorities may he affected by local sen

TORTURED THE RARALYTIC GIRL
AND THE THWARTED ROBBERS
BURNED HER TO DEATH.
Evidence of a Fiendish Crime Is Re
vealed In the Ashes of an Iso
lated Farm House.
Zanesvlllc', O., Dec. 7. A helpless
oung woman was ciematod In hor
own home, two miles from New Con
ruril, and thore are evidences that sho
was the victim of one of tho most
atrocious crimes ever committed In
Muskingum county.
Tho decedent Is Miss Sarah Wiley,
U10 invalid daughter of a widowed mo
ther, Mrs. Mary Wlloy, who with hor
son Jf.hn manages a large farm nenr
New Corcord, the mother and the two
children living thoic alone.
The farm Is Isolated to a certain ex
tent tho nearest neighbor living almost
i mile away, and thoio aro no houses
n sight of tlio Wiley home.
.Mrs. Wile) has always been consld
ed well-to-do. nd It has been the opin
ion o l'o iir,v"'orliood that hor homo
contained considerable wealth In the
lorm of valuable papers nnd money.
Mis. Wiley and hor son drove several
mllos away from their homo on a bust
ii'sm mission, leaving Miss Wiley alone
.it home She wn a helpless paralt
c, unable to move nuout In the rooms.
1 .if left her sitting In an Invalid's
i-halr.
Returning home late Mrs. Wiley nnd
liur son weie horrified to 11 ml tho
;ruatcr ixirtlon of the houso reduced
to nshvs. In the ctebrls they found
1 he charred remains of Sarah Wiley.
Tho Interior of tho room In which
sho was left was wholly destroyed,
but ho position In which the charred
body was found Indicates that she
had been brutnlly tortured and ma
liciously burned to death by some un
known person.
The theory Is that robbers entered
the homo after discovering tho ah
seuco of the mother and son and loot
ed all the rooms in search of valuables.
It Is furthor believed that they
sought by all manners of cruol means
to compel tho invalid girl to disclose
the hiding place of tho aupposod vnl
uablos and money and that upon her
refusal or Inability to satisfy thorn tho
llcndB sot fire to tho bod and ottior
Inflummablo articles in tho room.
Tlie family's coal oil can was'found
Just outside tho door, empty, and It is
surmised that tho contents of this can
were used to start tho blaze.
Tho girl's body was found sovcral
feet from tho Invalid chair. ltIs not
known whethor tho burglars secured
any valuables. Mrs. Wlloy Is uncom
municative on this subject; besides,
the hoube having been burned, sho Is
In doubt as to what may have been
consumed In the llamcb.
None of the neighbors learned of
tho tragedy until John Wiley aroused
them from their sleep and I0..1 ti.c
jvhnt had occurrol. Tho community
U greatly oxIctoJ over tho tragedy.
Thorn Is no clew whatover to the prob
able robbors Tho empty oil can Is
thus far tho single bit of positive ovl
deuce. Another Respite For Mrs. Myers.

undertakes to rofuto the chargo made
sy Mr. Storer that ho bad lent himself
to a schenio to havo tho popo elevate

rank of cardinal.
Tho proBldent employs some charac
teristic, vigorous language In his allu
sions to the former diplomat, the
words "dishonorable," "perfidy," and
"untrue" appearing. Ho also questions
whether Mr. Storer deserves to bo
called a gontlcman, since ho made
public some private correspondence.
Furthermore, in ordor, to make his
rebuke all the more poignant, he em
phasises the fact that tho Cincinnati
man whb dismissed from the diplomat
ic sorvlco fcr ontangllng tho adminis
tration In an ecclesiastical complica
tion. Tho president ndmlts, however, that,
while governor of Now York, ho spoke
to PreBldont McKlnley nbout Storer's
plan to have tho archbishop made a
prince of tho Catholic church.
