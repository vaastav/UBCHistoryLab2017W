assumption that r - opie have de

consistent with v , ' "4 for the na

a
tion's moral oblinans:; or, as the
President expresses it, "every obli
a
a
a
a
gation consonant witn American
ideals and sanctioned under our form
of government,". That is a safe state-
ment so long as American-ideals can
be interpreted exclusively by the pre
sent administration.
The President happily reassures the
country as to the prospect of the
maintenance of peace in.the world, ai-o-Vi
Embassador Harvey's recent

the Railroad Labor board with the

of the companies and of the unions
from the labor division, reflects . ms
well-justified disappointment over the

Railroad Labor board faces a troubled

Yet there will be difficulty in carrying
through the. President's plan tor tyro
reasons. The railroad labor organiza
tions will probably object to the eli
mination of their representatives from
the new tribunal and aiso to tne bta
tlement of wage disputes by a body
also charged with the regulation ot
railroad rates. "It is, their comenuon
that rates and wages are not and
should not be tied together.

i their personal liberty, to remember
that they set the example and bred
a contempt for law which will ul
timately destroy the republic." The
