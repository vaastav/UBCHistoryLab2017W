,J|f OUR STANDING ARMY.
At the time the limit of the stand
ing army was under discussion some
statesmen either possessed or pre
tended great fear lest this should be
come a military nation to be ridden
over by its standing army. Of course
that was nothing new. It had been
talked before, even at the close of the
civil war. When that great struggle
was at its end the vast army that
was mustered out was scattered to all
parts of the United States and made
as good citizens as they had soldiers.
At the close of the war with Spain,
when we found ourselves In possession
of various islands, which were to be
protected both against themselves and
against hungry nations, It was deemed
necessary to Increase the standing
army of the United States. From the
time of the civil war to that date
the limit had been extremely low for
'a nation of this size. Those who op
posed the movement pictured the ter
rorisms of militarism, as if there
might be a rush to the ranKS for the
purpose of overriding the peaceful
citizens.
I There was not danger from this, as
may be seen from the statements of
Secretary of War Taft in his annual
report. He says it is with difficulty
tha,t the army is maintained. Deser
tions are on the increase, and enlist
ments are slow notwithstanding the
utmost efforts of the department. The
authorized strength of the army now
is 62,489 men. The present strength
Is several thousand short of that mark,
This is an Indication that there is
i"nothing doing" In army life. When
there is a chance'for fighting there is
no trouble in getting enlistments. With
all of the scattered possessions of the
"United States there is only a demand
for a handful of soldiers in action here
and there with long spaces of time
intervening. Militarism is a myth.
The small standing army is so widely
scattered that it is hardly heard of
except when they have marches or a
bit of trouble such as broke out in
Brownsville, Texas.
Aside from the difficulty of maintain
ing a standing army of this size In
time of peace, the secretary discusses
the reasons for desertion. He believes
that the frequent haling of the sol
diers before the court for minor of
fenses is the cause of dissatisfaction
and discouragement. "It is apparent
from the records," he says, "that many
men have been tried for the most triv
al offenses." It is observed that once
in court the man's record is spoiled,
his pride suffers, he becomes disheart
ened, grows careless and more trials
follow.
As. long as civil life is preferable
to the military, and there is no com
pulsory service there seems to be lit
tle danger from the United States
army.
ROOSEVELT. TO SHAW.
Realizing that Secretary Shaw is
about to leave his official family Presi
dent Roosevelt has vrritten him a con
gratulatory letter upon his five years
of service as secretary of the treasury.
In his fifth and last annual report, re
cently mr.de public, thn secretary
briefly reviews the work of the five year
period, and it will be observed in the
following that this is what caused
the President to tender the congratula
tions he has. The letter follows:
I The White House, Washington, Dec.
7.—L. M. Shaw, Secretary of the
Treasury—My Dear Mr Secretary: I
have just read through the resume of
the treasury operations during the five
years that you have been secretary. I
am so impressed by this plain recital
of what has been accomplished by
you that I take this opportunity of
telling you so and at the same time of
expressing my very profound appre
ciation of your services. People tend
to forget year by year that the secre
tary of the treasury stands between
them and business disaster. This re
port of yours shows how every year
some crisis has occurred which might
have the most serious effect if it had
not been met just as you have met it.
It is a remarkable showing and I con
gratulate you upon it.
Theodore Roosevelt.
"People tend to forget year by year
that the secretary of the treasury
stands between them and business dis
aster." Yes, they do.
'JLhey
not
•only forget the efficient service of a
man but some of them will hound him
if he does and hound him if he doesn't
Secretary Shaw has been found by the
President to be one of the greatest
men of his cabinet, yet he has been
the victim of more "'rumors of falling
out with the President" and "breaches
that would cause him to leave the cabi
net" and anything else that a few
Washington correspondents could
think of than any other member of the
cabinet.
These things may have been annoy
ing, but they were not damaging. The
President and the people have recog
nized from time to time the true worth
of Secretary Shaw and from coast to
coast he is spoken of, by those who
are not dealing in small politics, as
one of the greatest secretaries of the
treasury that the country has had.
When the President says, "This re
port of yours shows how every year
some criBis has occurred which might
have the most serious effects if it had
not been met just as you have met
it," he is simply saying what the peo
ple know. Secretary Shaw has met
i£S
"P
every crisis, and it is with great re
gret that the nation sees him leave
the cabinet. «.
ROOSEVELT PEACE COMMISSION.
No president have given more atten
tion to the immediate troubles be
tween capital and labor than has Presi
dent Roosevelt. Others has been
equally concerned over the prosperity
and well being of both, but none
has exerted iiuch tireless efforts lo
bring both close together as has the
present executive
His latest announcement, that he
will place his recently acquired peace
prize of $40,000 in trust to be used In
paying expenses of a commission to
aid in the settlement of labor disputes,
is consistent with his entire course
in the dealing with this problem. The
persons who will have charge of this
fund are the chief justice of the su
preme court, the secretary of agricul
ture, anu representatives of both the
capital and the labor classes.
It is proposed to have a meeting
once every year in Washington for the
purpose of ameliorating conditions be
tween the employers and the em
ployes. Before President Roosevelt in
terested himself in the difficulties that
arise between the two classes they
had been left* practically alone to set
tle grievances either i.. court or out
to the best of their ability. The
President's first action was in connec
tion with the coal strike soon after he
took the seat of the executive.. Suc
cess crowned his efforts in this, and that" either
ever since he has had only words cal
culated to be conciliatory in his public
utterances and documents.
It does not seem necessary that such
conditions should prevail as have been
revealed in the Shea trial in Chicago,
such as slugging, beating and shooting
In order to settle difference between
the garment workers and their em
ployers. Other labor organizations
have been able to reach terms without
using any such methods as these.
The controversies between employer
and employe have become serious.
Some labor organizations have wise
leaders. Others, like some of the em
ployers, have more power than
judgment. There is enough wisdom
and good judgment in both classes to
enable them to utilize with great good
the opportunity nor: offered by Presi
dent Roosevelt, and with his aid,
which has been worth so much in ~ie
past, there may be at least hope for
the future.
PORTO RICO.
1
Plenty, peace and prosperity pre
vail in Porto Rico, according to the
special message of President Roose
velt to congress in which he discusses
the conditions on the island. This
treatise is a revelation to the people
of the United States. At the time the
island came into the possession of
this country as one of the marks of
the close of the war with Spain there
was much more interest in it than
there had been for years previous, be
cause its future was to be worked out
by Uncle Sam. When military gave
way to civil government and. the
word came that the islanders had ex
perienced a new beginning, there was
less attention given to the place by
the general public, It being of more
particular interest to persons having
money to Invest.
President Roosevelt in his message
shows what the eight years have done
for Porto Rico. He tells congress
that the Porto Ricans are deserving
of having citizenship conferred upon
them. He says that they should be
thus rewarded for what they have
done and that we should thus show
our appreciation of their efforts to
conduct themselves in the manner that
becomes good citizenship.
As to their ideas of self government

try. There has been considerable
night when the pulpit was occupied
by half a dozen self-styled "converted
bums" from the Jerry McAuley mis
sion.
This is the church home of such peo
ple as Helen Gould and Mrs. Russell
Sage, and their eyes were opened,
their hearts touched and their purse
strings loosened by what they heard
from these former drunkards and crim
inals of the transforming power of the
gospel.
There was nothing particularly new
in this. The Pacific Garden mission
in Chicago is older than the Jerry
McAuley mission and has a larger
number of wonderful conversions ,to
its credit. These converts have fre
quently visited and spoken in
the largest and most fashion
able churches in Chicago and
always with the same results
as were witnessed on Sunday
night in New York. There are many
other cities where similar scenes are
constantly occurring.
The remarkable thing about It Is
that two such widely different types
of Protestant Christianity should con
tinue to exist side by side without the
slightest tendency to coalesce. One
type is wrapped up in formality, ele
gance and insensibility. The other
courts squr.lid quarters and reaches
out for the most abject people in the
world and brings them with rejoicing
into the Christian fold. Is it possible
that both types are right? To an un
prejudiced outsider it would appear
the elegant church or
the repulsive mission is wrong in
principle and ought to be abolished.
There can be no doubt that the mis
sion has come to reprove and correct
the church and the "converted bum"
to shame the ordained clergyman.
They have shown that the world is
tired of religious formalism and that
there is a power in Christianity which
is unexercised and unknown where
wealth and splendor are the accompan.
tments of religion.
Much attention has been attracted
lately to the scarcity of Christian
ministers and to t}ie poverty and de
cay of the theological seminaries, and
one reason for these discouraging
conditions has been overlooked. The
country has been flooded with the
converts of these missions and with
the graduates of. the Moody Biblical
Institute, who lack education and re
finement as well as ecclesiastical au
thority, but who get nearer to the
people than the professional minister
did and have almost crowded him out
of business.

Cedar Rapids Gazette.—Lacey is a
strong man and would make a good

not, the Gazette believes, reflective

choice of Iowa republicans. But if a
standpatter were to be chosen, none
of that type of republicans is better

An Unitarian Sermon.
Editor Courier:
Many Unitarians In Ottumwa and
elsewhere would be glad to read the
following extracts from a sermon by
Rev. Mary A. Safford, delivered in Dos
Moines on Sunday, Dec. 9. It was un
doubtedly called out by reason of the
union revival services now being con
ducted in that city by Dr. J. Wilbur
Chapman and the other evangelists.
The Register and Leader, In publish
ing the sermon, says:
"In the face of the perfect storm of
sermons which tell the gosnel story,
raising the Christ to the dignity of
God and lelying on the help of the
power with which He is thus endowed,
for the transformation of countless
lives, the Rev. Mary A. Safford of the
Unitarian church preached yesterday a
strong sermon setting forth the con
trary view, that Jesus was a man, a
good man, it is true, but nevertheless
a man, subject to the limitations of
the flesh, and should therefore not be
worshipped in the place of the God
of the monotheists."
Parts of her address are as follows:
Shall we worship God or Jesus?
We flnd an answer to this question
in John iv: 23-24.
"But the hour cometh and now is
when the true worshippers shall wor
ship the Father in spirit and In truth
for the Father seeketh such to worship
Him. God is a spirit and they that
worship Him must worship Him in
spirit and in truth."
Accept His Teachings.
Unitarian churches accept the relig
ion of Jesus, holding, In accordance
with His teaching, that practical re
ligion is summed up in love to God and
love to man. We have no creed which
Is made a test of character or fellow
ship.
We worship, as Jesus worshipped,
one God, the Father of all—the eter
nal life—soul of the universe.
We do not think it essential to pray
in the name of Jesus, for He himself
said, "After this manner pray ye," and
then uttered the beautiful prayer,
which begins, "Our Father who art ih
heaven," and closes without any rev
erence whatever to the name of Him
who taught men thus to pray. But this
religion of Jesus which we accept dif
fers widely from the Chrlslanlty of the
creeds.
For this reason, strange as It may
seem, those who worship the God of
Jesus are regarded as heretics by those
who worship Jesus himself.
We do not call them heretics, how
ever.
In a noble human being we have
the highest manifestations of duty. In
so far as worship is but recognition of
true worth, loving reverently for lofty
character, Unitarians heartily unite
with Trinitarians in tribute of honor
and praise to the high souled Galilean
teacher who went about doing good.
But His own teaching and our own
reason forbid us to exalt this noble
leader to the place of God. We cannot
adore him as the creator and supreme
ruler of the universe. For to us, as to
Jesus and to Paul, there Is one God
and Father of all, who -is above all
and through all and in us all. This
being true the great Galilean—while
nobly manifesting the divine—could
not completely incarnate deity
So to worship Him as the infinite,
eternal God Is to make the part equal
to the whole. It is to condense into
one life the universal lifS.
Not In Accord With Reason.
Yet, while belief in the deity of Je
sus does not accord with his own teach
ing, nor with the teaching of modern
science and reason, the origin and
growth of this belief is plain.
As were the rest of-his countrymen,
so was Jesus, a strict monothiest or
believed In our God. Had He believed
himself to be the infinite, eternal God,
surely ne would have affirmed his su
preme divinity. He would have taken
great pains to impress this belief on
the minds of his disciples. It was so
foreign to their thought that it would
have been necessary for him to state
it clearly and strongly over and over
again to lead them to accept It. But
the gospel records contain' no such
teaching. Neither do they reveal any
thing of the sense of awe his disciples
would have felt had they believed
themselves to be in the presence of
the Almighty Ruler of the universe
embodied in a human form.
To the disciples as to all of the early
Christians, Jesus was the honored
teacher, the long expected Messiah,
the Good Shepherd of his flock of faith
ful followers. But while the Jews of
the time of Jesus were strict mono
theists, earthly heroes were often del
fled in the Greek and Roman worlds,
where Christianity had its early
growth. Among the Greeks and Ro
mans a belief in gods in human form
was common.
As the figure of the noble Nazarene
receded farther and farther into the
past more and more was he exalted in
the minds of his followers.
At last, in accordance with the
thought of the age, he too was deified
and worshipped as God.
Not a Dishonor.
No, we do not dishonor Jesus be
cause we. do not worship Him as the
incarnate God, for He never claimed
such worship. Because Jesus was our
brother man, who had to face the
world's temptations as we must face
them and fight life's battles as we must
fight them. His- victories give us
strength and courage, make us feel
that we, too, may conquer evil and
scale the heights of noble living He
climbed so long ago.
But if we worshipped Him as God,
His life would lack its present power
in our lives.
Therefore we rejoice in the divine
humanity of Jesus, looking forward to
the day when none will worship Him
as God, while all will reverence the
strength and beauty of His character.
To deify Jesus not only limits divin
ity to a single, human personality, but
also exalts one child of the Father at
the expense of all the rest of His chil
dren. In the yearnings and the striv
ings of these other children there
pulses the same divine life that made
beautiful the life of Jesus.
May we thus see the Eternal In ev
ery face that is radiant with high
thought or unselfish love. For if it
helps us to find God in one life„ much

Albia, Iowa, Nov. 1, 1905.
I live six miles east of Albia and
was afflicted with rupture for 40
years, I had it strangulated sev
eral times so I could not get It
back. The doctors wanted to oper
ate on me and said there was no
other way to be cured, but I would
not be operated .on, and finally the
rupture went_ back. I suffered se
vere pain from the rupture and did
not get any relief until I went to
Dr. Bonham, who said he could
cure me. I was treated over a year
ago and was soon cured, and have
not worn a truss for some time and
feel very well, and have no trouble
whatever.
