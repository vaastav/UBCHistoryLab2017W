THE PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE.
"While President McKlnley's third annual
message to congress contains no surprises,
it Is an unusually important document,
and, in spite of its extraordinary length,
will be read with much more Interest than
Is usually excited by voluminous state
papers,
The president covers the leading ques
tions that are likely to engage the atten
tion, of congress with characteristic
thoroughness, and his recommendations
are clear and forcible. These recommenda
tions are in accordance with the estab-
lished principles' of the Republican party
and the manifest tendency and duty of the
country as to the new issues. In this mes
sage may be found an Impressive reflection
of the greater progress upon which the
nation has entered.
The president urges the fixing of the
gold standard by law the making of the
letter of the law to conform to the present
construction, to the end that our standard
may be more definite and more secure. He
recommends such currency and banking re
visions as have been suggested by the
special commissions of tho house and the
senate, and points out that the present
time. In which money is plentiful and pros
perity great, is most opportune for the
making ot these reforms.
One of the most Important recommenda
tions Is that In regard to the merchant
marine. The president would have con
gress take such action as will stimulate
the building and operating ot merchant
ships, that our sea commerce may be made
oiihTensurate with our industrial great
' ness, our coast trade and our national Im
portance. It is clearly implied that the
president favors the payment of subsidies,
such as all the great sea-trading nations
Biave granted. In order to bring about this
desired development.
In taking tip the subject of trusts the
president is confronted by the same dif
ficulty that has inevitably attached Itself
to this question the difficulty of making
distinctions between the abusive monopoly
JrJand the harmless and beneficial combina
tion; but he urges congress to ascertain
and assert its power toward the regulation
of trust Impositions where they may be
found, and for precedents he quotes from
President Harrison's message of 1ES9, Pres
ident Cleveland's message of 1896, and
points to the' Sherman act of 1890. "While
recognizing the necessity for harmony, not
only, among the anti-trust laws of the
various1 states but between the state and
, federal laws, the president makes no sug
gestions as to how this harmony may be
brought about a very Important problem.
Although congressional action on the
KIcaraguan canal Is held up, pending the
I report of the newly appointed commission,
the president reiterates his views as to the
great importance of this enterprise and the
expedience of the earliest possible action.
The future of Cuba, so far as the in
terests of the "United States are concerned,
can not be determined at this time, ac-
cording to the president's view. There Is
no qualification of the original declaration
in behalf of the Cubans, but there is a
strong intimation that much time and fos
tering may be required to give the island
a stable government, and that until this
result is attained the authority of the
"United States will not be withdrawn.
The president urges the earliest decision
possible as to the orm of government nec
essary for Porto Rico to take the place of
the present military form, and the earliest
possible measures to create a market In
this country for Porto RIcan products
which have lost their Spanish trade. This
lstn accordance with the official reports
upon Porto RIcan condition.
The expected has come In the positive dec
laration of the president that the Philip
pines must be retained, and that there
must be something more than nominal au
thority. The flag is not to be withdrawn
with the president's consent, and he does
not believe that the people of the United
States desire such withdrawal.
Hawaii demands early attention, In the
executive's opinion, annexation having left
the Islands in more or less confusion pend
ing the adoption of permanent regulations.
There Is nothing of vital Importance
touching foreign affairs in general. The
president points out the increasing reci
procity in trade between the United States
and Germany and Great Britain. He re
news his recommendation for the appoint
ment of a. commission to investigate the
opportunities for and the obstacles to the
extension ot Chinese trade, and evidently
believes that detailed recommendations as
to- this phase of the Eastern question
should be deferred, until such investigation
shall have been made and reported.
Some remark has been excited by the
fact that the message contains no mention
of the tariff. This omission might be ex
cused, It would seem, by the fact that un
settled Issues have required 12.000 words
for . their discussion. The tariff is no longer
lneontroversy. There I no active opposi
tion to It at present. The value of protec-
tlon and the president's faith ln-the policy
are Implied In the satisfaction 'with which
he dwells upon the condition otbe coun
try under the existing taring law. Jt lsrue
that protection was not 'mentioned, but
neltherwas fhe Fugitive Slave'Jaw nor the
resumption of -specie payment.
j THE PHILIPPINES.
"While 'the. president, in his message' to
Icongress, has reviewed the whole of the
Philippine question, from the advent of
Dewey in Manila bay to the flight of
(Agulnaldo, apd while, he has -covered, very
'appropriately at this tlme,"the proceedings
,that gave to the United States absolute
title to the Islands and responsibility be
fore the world forthe maintenance of peace
'within, their shores, here is .nothing par
ticularly new In the advice to congress' on
this subject, with the exception of that
which relates to the establishment of a
protectorate in lieu of a more authoritative
form of government.
As the protectorate scheme Is a favorite
one with those who are opposed to the
folding of the Philippines, the president's
views are interesting. He points out in
the first place that the granting of inde
pendence under a United States protecto
rate would be disloyal to the large major
ity of the Filipinos, who, from the first,
have preferred "United States authority.
Continuing, he says: "It would place the
peaceable and loyal majority, who ask
nothing better than to accept our author
ity, at the mercy of armed insurgents. It
would make us responsible for the acts of
the insurgent leaders and give us no power
to control them. It would charge us with
the task of protecting them against each
other, and defending them against any
foreign power with which they chose to
quarrel. In short, it would take from the
congress of the United States the power
of declaring war and vest that tremendous
prerogative in the Tagalo leader of the
hour."
As to the action that congress may take
on this subject, the president dismisses the
matter with the belief that congress will
not regard the protectorate scheme as
worthy of consideration. The general atti
tude of the administration toward the
Filipinos is thus described:
"No effort will be spared to build up the
waste places desolated by war and by long
years ot misgovernment. "We shall not
wait for the. end of the strife to begin the
beneficent work. "We shall continue, as we
have begun, to open the schools and the
churches, to set the courts In operation, to
foster Industry and trade and agriculture,
and In every way in our power to make
these people whom Providence has brought
within our jurisdiction feel that it is their
liberty and not our power, their welfare
and not our gain that we are seeking to
enhance. Our flag has never waved over
any community but in blessing. I believe
the Filipinos will soon recognize the fact
that it has not lost its gift of benediction in
its world wide journey to their shores."
UNEQUAL REPRESENTATION IN
CONGRESS.
Mr. C. Leland, Kansas member of the
Republican national committee, is in favor
of changing the basis on which delegates
to the national convention are apportioned
among the states. He thinks the states
should be given- representation in propor
tion to the number of Republican votes
cast, thus giving the strongest Republican
states most power In the convention. Need
less to say, the proposed change would re
duce the representation from the South
tremendously.
However just and reasonable the new
scheme may appear -to be, we nevertheless
are convinced that it is a reform which
commences at the wrong end. At present
the delegates are apportioned at the rate
of two for each congressional district. If
there were no more congressional districts
In the Southern states than the vote cast
by" the people there would entitle them
to, the objections to the present system
would largely disappear. "What Is needed
more imperatively than a change In the
convention basis Is a change in the law
of apportionment which will take from the
Southern states a number of congressmen
to which they are not entitled.
The fourteenth amendment to the consti
tution declares that congressional repre
sentatives shall be apportioned among the
several states according to their in
habitants, "counting the whole number of
persons In each state, excluding Indians
not taxed." But there is a qualification to
this provision which says that "when tho
right to vote at any election is denied to
any of the male Inhabitants of such state,
being 21 j ears of age, or in any way
abridged, except for participation in re
bellion or other crime, the basis ' of rep
resentation therein shall be reduced in
the proportion which the number of such
male citizens shall bear to the whole num
ber of male citizens 21 years of age in such
state."
The Southerners themselves do not at
tempt to deny that they have disfran
chised the negro voter. In some states
the disfranchisement has ,come about
through intimidation, and in others it is
accomplished by amendments to the con
stitution. For example, in Mississippi the
new constitution provides for both an ed
ucational and property qualification. This
In itself might not be objected to if It ap
plied alike to whites and blacks. But by
a cunning provision it is made to apply
only to the blacks. The section recites
that neither the educational nor property
quallfication shall apply to any person who
was a voter, or whose father was a voter.
In 1S67. This date goes back of the en
franchisement of the blacks. The only
white man prohibited Is the foreigner who
can neither read nor write and who came
to America after 1SC7, whereas the negro
is barred from the polls unless he meets
all the qualifications. It is said that this
provision admits, SCt000 illiterate whites to,
the. ballot, while not an illiterate black can
vote at all.
The result is that In many of the
Southern districts less than one-halt of
the real voting .population monopolize the
elections. Below we have prepared a little
table showing ' the vast disproportion cf
representation In congress when based on
the votes cast. The figures are taken
from fhe 'election returns 'b 1SW. and In
the different columns are .shown, thi. num

tricts and by .states:

We have taken .from Missouri only the
seven districts crrresponding with those in
South Carolina find Kansas. The remain
der of the Missouri districts woull not ma
terially alter the state's average, and the
average in Kansas is not much above the
'average in all the Northern states. For
example, Nebraska cast 35.S2S votes for
each of her congressmen, and Texas, wheie
negro disfranchisement has not taken
place, has an average of 31,:J3-
It Is plain, then, that the congressman
from Kansas or Missouri represents from
ten to twelve times as many voters as
the congressman from South Carolina. Th's
inequality Is worse than unjust. Having
denied a great portion of their population
the rights- of citizenship, the Southern
states ought to be withheld from any great
er proportional representation than they
themselves nie willing to give their own
citizens. Congress Is presumed to express
the wishes of the people as voiced at the
elections. Under the present system of
apportionment the Missouri congressman
with 43,000 votes behind him has no more
voice In congress than the South Carolina
member with 4,000 votes. Thus the South
ern voter has from ten to twelve times
more representation than the Northern
Voter. There should be such a change in
the system as will "give the states and
the people representation In proportion to
their voting strength. The methods of dis
franchisement practiced in the South are
clearly in defiance of the Intent and pur
pose of the fourteenth amendment, and
if they are'not technically so the consti
tution needs some overhauling.
EDITORIAL NOTES.
The supreme court of the United States
has just put an unpleasant end to one pipe
dream.
The message contains few surprises. The
president's position on all important ques
tions was already familiar to the country-
It Is due Mr. Cleveland to say that while
the message is longer than the messages
he used to write, it Is not nearly so heavy.
The critical eye ot Mr. "William J. Bryan
will .undoubtedly find a few things In Mr.
McKlnley's production to vent hl3 disap
proval on.
Those who dislike any portion of the
message 'will find plenty of room In the
document to look around for something
more pleasing.
If Mrs. Aguinaldo has any say-so in the
matter, the terms of surrender will in
clude a return of those barrels of feminine
wearing apparel.
Singularly enough. President McKInley
failed to mention that British-German-American
alliance that Mr. Chamberlain
has been telling us of.
Those Boers are plucky fellows. Although
Great Britain is shipping cargo after car
go of Missouri mules to the Transvaal they
show no signs of giving in.
There Is nothing in the message to in
dicate that the president has-changed his
mind In regard to Aguinaldo not being a
second George "Washington.
It would seem from the supreme court's
decision on the pipe trust that the presi
dent's recommendation for further anti
trust legislation is superfluous.
It Is remarked that the president ig
nored the tariff. So he did. He also ig
nored the Bred Scott decision. The mes
sage deals only with matters of live inter
est. Hon. Ben Harrison says it "would be a
national shame" to allow a polygamist to
sit in congress. Mr. Harrison is a firm be
liever In the doctrine of one wife at a
time.
Hon. Billy Mason seems to have given
up being ashamed of his country, but
Senator Pettlgrew will doubtless find prov
ocation In the message for a few addi
tional blushes.
The "party that does things" has an un
commonly large number of Important
things to do just ahead of It, but there is
no thought of shirking any duty or shift
ing any responsibility.
Thanks to the highest court of the coun
try, the farmer and laboring man will now
be able to lay In their winter's supply ot
gas piping without paying tribute to the
pipe octopus. It Is tremendous relief.
It is unfortunate for Mr. Roberts that
the two parties are not a tie in the house.
In that case it would be impossible to con
vince the Democrats that the Utah mem
ber should be excluded on account of an
extra wife or so.
KANSAS TOPICS.
Newspnper Progress.
The Sallna Dally Republican-Journal, al
ready one of the best papers In Central
Kansas, has contracted for a telegraphic
news report.

It is related of the leader of fashion n
Atchison that recently she had only an

Played Tonnm on Harris.
Somebody in Oklahoma sent Hon. Jack
Harris, of Ottawa, a fat 'possum on which
the express charges amounted to J1.9i. The
ruling price for a fat 'possum is 23 cents,
and Harris is a vegetarian.
Gnmbled in a Good Cause.
The ladles of "Wichita have been canvass
ing the town for subscriptions in aid of
the poor. They tackled I R. Delaney, of
the Santa Fe, In a cigar store. He had
just one nickel In his pocket. He took this
out, walked over to the slot machine and
dropped It in. Out rolled $3 in nickels,
which Delaney piled Into the apron of one
of the ladies. The Lord works in myster
ious ways His wonders to perform.
At Least Three Necessary.
It takes more than two guesses to hit
off a man's politics In Kansas, If we may
believe the following story from the "Wich
ita Eagle:
Two hunters, last week. In Sumner
county, when ordered away by an irate
farmer, passed themselves off as follows:
"I am Governor Stanley," said one. "I
know it." said the farmer. "Get off the
farm." "And I." said the other hunter,
"am ex-Governor Leedy." "I know that,"
said the farmer. "Get off my farm." The
farmer's neighbor told the hunters after
ward that the man had voted for Peffer
for governor.
An Artist' In Obituaries.
In her best days the Sweet Singer of
Michigan could scarcely reach the poetic
flights of a Kansas woman who now writes
for the Jefferson county papers, her best
vein being In the line of obituary and con
solation verse. BelowMsa sample, taken"
from a fifteen stanza'poenr, written on the
death of a neighbor woman:
Now, dear Lewis, to you I'll say.
You are young, so trong and gay:
But oh. bow eoon can death's alarm
Bring you down from all harm.
Around her bed the children stood .
With eyes brim full of tears;
Oh. papa. dear, the children said.
Oh, tell us. is dear mamma dead?
Ob, yes. dear children, she Is dead,
1 feci quite sure she if,
1 tried so bard to make her hear.
Or see my (ace once more.
I tried so hard to bring her to,
I thought I surely could:
But God has called her home to rest
And we are left alone.
I called her; jes, I called her;
Zerilda. dear. I said.
How do jou tee! Just now?
How is 3 our aching head?
A "Broncho-Buster."'
Here's jour "snorting, rip-cavorting boy
down en the fighting line" "W. G. Bufflng
ton, late of Sumner county, who thus mod
estly describes his own achievements:
"Talk about ponies bucking, you ought
to see them here on this island ot Panay.
The horses are all wild and afraid of a
white man. There Is a lieutenant here who
was a rough rider, and there was one
horse that he couldn't mount. I heard
about him, so I went up there to see him.
The lieutenant said that he could not be
rode and that none of his gang would
tackle him. I told him I thought I could
ride him. He laughed and said I couldn't
get on him. I got him out and worked
about five minutes and was on his back,
and buck? I guess he did, but he couldn't
get me off. He shook me up a lot, but I
rode him, and the lieutenant said I was a
broncho-buster for sure. There were two
other horses no one could ride, and I rode
them, too. The captain came up the
mountain and when I got through he
asked me if I wouldn't join his company."
A Great Year for Kansas.
The products of agriculture and stock
raising In Kansas for 1899 were the great
est for any year in the state's history with
the exception ot 1S91, whin the product was
JC3.S13 more. By comparing the repo.'t ot
Secretary Coburn as published yesterlay
with the reports for ten years previous we
are able to present the following table
the values given representing all the prod
ucts of field, garden and ranch, except the
one Item of live stock on hand:

In this connection it will be Interesting
to compare the returns from the three
greatest wealth-producing products of the
state wheat, corn and live stock. In the
following table the wheat and corn Is con
sidered in bushels and the live .stock in
dollars:

By taking these two tables together,
that Is, by considering prices as well as
yields, it will, be observed that one year
runs pretty well with another and that
Kansas has had no very disastrous crop
failures. The average return for the eleven
years" is something like $120,000,000 for each
year. The poorest year of the entire eleven
fell only $23,000,000 short of the average,
and the greatest year exceeded it by only
$23,000,000. This ought to be nearly con
clusive on the point of the state's reliabil
ity. It overturns the belief that Kansas is
a region of extremes where periods of
starvation alternate with periods of plenty.
Perhaps no other state In the Union can
show such a uniformity In Its crop results.
Another rather curious fact Is revealed
In these tables. Good wheat years are sel
dom good corn years. "When there is an
extraordinary crop of one, there usually Is
a short crop ot the other. The most marked
exception to this rule is the present year,
when both corn and wheat were above the
average. For the eleven years wheat has
averaged about 37,000,000 bushels, while
corn has averaged 156,000,000 bushels. Per
haps the most unvarying ot all the Kansas
products Is live stock. In eleven years it
has never gone below $10,000,000, and Its
highest point was $31,000,000.
Dewey's Democratic Spouse.
In the course ot an editorial the Eureka
Union advances some weird thoughts in re
gard to the Admiral Dewey matter. It
holds that Dewey is a Republican and
that he invited trouble by marrying a Dem
ocratic widow, and it cites as parallel the
matrimonial venture of Boaz who took a
Moabltlsh widow Instead of marrying one
of his own race. It cites also the fact that
David married two widows and had heaps
of trouble, while Solomon married all the
smart women he could find without having
any trouble until he yoked up with the
daughter of Pharaoh and gave her a house.
We are not exactly clear as to what the
Union is driving at, unless it means that
Dewey should have married a Republican
widow, or remained unmarried, or married
all the widows he could find. However, his
conclusion that Kansas men are too smart
to mix up houses and widows Is not war
ranted by the facts. One of the leading
Republican statesmen of Kansas married
a Democratic widow and she brought him
a fine house
MISSOURI POINTS.
AsIc Harry Howci.
Here Is a pertinent "way out" suggestion
by the Springfield Republican that really
should not be overlooked by those mo3t
directly Interested: "If St. Louis wants to
raise the remaining $1,000,000 for her
world's fair, why does she not ask young
Mr. Harry Hawes how to do it?"
Better Than the Franklin Syndicate.
As genuine get-rich-quick Institutions
some of those Joplin lead mines are hard
to beat, especially when such a record is
made as was that of the "Budweiser" one
day last week, when in fifteen hours' work
the net profits cleaned up amounted to
$429.23. But, then, perhaps, there may te
something in the name.
A Favorable Prospect.
Brookfield's population has suffered de
pletion to the extent of seventy-seven
through death during the current year, but
inasmuch as there have been 122 births
and eighty-one marriages there within the
same.perlod, Charley Green, of the Argus,
who is himself a bridegroom, is doubtless
warranted In- the prophecy that Linn
county's thriving metropolis "Is destined
to multiply and grow greater in the fu
ture." Rocky for Stone.
"Such a hope, however, Is-vain," sor
rowfully admits Colonel "Cor" Roach, in
his; Carthage Democrat, by way of com
ment In tersely dismissing the statement
to the effect that "a Democratic state poli
tician who is in a position to know (and
his name is not Phelps, either), and he is
a Stone man, too, is authority for saying
It will not ba either Boss Croker's nor
Stone's fault, if "William J.Js not the nom
inee for president'ln 1900."
Strawberries Will Be Scarce.
Southwest Missouri strawberries will be
more of a luxury, in price at least, the
coming season than heretofore. The. re
ports made at the meeting of the Jasper
county growers the other night indicate
that the coming crop outlook Is unpromis
ing, and the heaviest operators in Jasper
county, which is the center of one of the
most prolific strawberry-producing regions
in America, assert that the acreage there
is steadily decreasing and that palmy daj-3
of the Industry around Carthage and Sar-
coxie are past.
A Manual Par Excellence.
For one reason at least Missouri news
paper men, regardless ot political beliefs,
will regret the retirement of Secretary of
State Lesueur at the expiration of his
present term. It will be difficult to con
vince them that any other incumbent will
be likely to provide quite so thoroughly
adequate and satisfactory a compendium
of valuable up-to-date information con
cerning Missouri matters, political, indus
trial and general, as is the genial secre
tary's biennial blue book, the recently-Issued
edition of which is. If possible, more
admirable than its much-prized predeces
sors. The Hit Wn'i Colonel Hltt's.
Colonel Ed Smith's paper, the Chula
News, takes to task the Chiillcothe press
for having Improperly awarded to the Com
mercial Club the credit for raising the
large sum In cash which was donated
toward the cost of Chllllcothe's new bridge
over Grand: river which Livingston county
is to build. "As a matter of fact," In
sists the News, "the Commercial Club
had nothing at all to do with It. Colonel
Jesse Hltt raised the $2,000 and was made
an honorary member of the club for hav
ing done' so. He was not even a member
until after he had solicited and secured
subscriptions for the entire amount. "What's
the matter with you fellows? Can't a man
be a hero In America only for a few hours
at a time?"
Had Fun With Heather.
E. Clay Heather, prosecuting attorney of
Marlon county and a popular resident of
Palmyra, was married In that city one
day last week to Miss Julia Gupton, a
much admired local belle, and the oppor
tunity thus afforded for a little fun at
their expense was not overlooked by their
friends. At Palmyra Junction some of the
jokers boarded the train which was to
bear the happy pair away on their wed
ding tour and distributed cards on which
was printed the following: "A newly mar
ried couple will take this train at the
Palmyra depot. They are taking a bridal
trip to St. Louis, and their friends are
trying to make It interesting for them.
Their trunks have been duly decorated and
placarded, and the passengers on this
train are requested to make them feel at
home by giving them a cordial reception
when they enter the car. "When the depot
is reaohed kindly put your head out of
the window and hurrah for Clay Heather.
Don't let them spoon on the train."
"Though now he la married.
Clay Heather long tarried.
With Cupid he struggled and battled;
He's so experienced and bold.
He has frequently told
How on this occasion he could not be rattled.
So passengers, dear.
You hare nothing to fear.
The groom ou cannot embarrass or tease;
Just hard at them stare
Clay Heather don't care:
Of course ba will feel at his ease."
That "Face of Jack."
"Speaking of selling mines In this dis
trict reminds me of an incident that oc
curred in connection with the sale of a
certain mine recently not a thousand miles
from Joplin," said a well known mining
operator to a party of friends and a Her
ald representative In the lobby of the prin
cipal hotel in the zinc metropolis the other
night. "The mine In question had been
pajing some handsome dividends for spv
eral months and a w.-ll known firm of pro
moters had an option on it and were in a
fair way to close the deal with an East
ern syndicate, when the owners suddenly
realized that the mine was practically 'cut
blind." Negotiations for the sale had prac
tically come to a focus and an 'expert"
was sent out by the Eastern syndicate to
pass upon the property. On the day that
he arrived in town the mine was shut
down upon the pretext of cleaning the
pond and repairing the machinery. Several
tons of jack and a few thousand of lead
were in the bins when the 'expert' drove
out to the mine and, altogether, the pros
pect viewed from the top of the ground
looked 'very favorable. But underground1
It looked different to a man acquainted
with mining in this district. The ground
was badly honycombed and really the
only ore In sight was in one big pillar that
had been left to hold the ground. The 'ex
pert' from the East was taken down in
the ground in company with a home-made
expert who had 'Just growed up" In the
mines in and around Joplin, and the first
thing the Eastern expert ran up against
was tills big pillar of almost solid jack and
lead. He marveled at its richness, and
wa3 led around a devious winding drift
that connected again with the first and
plump up against the same pillar of ore
from another side, where the ore looked
even richer than where first seen. This
operation was repeated seven times by as
many different routes and when the last
round had been completed the Eastern 'ex
pert's' ejes bulged out like the famous
knot on a tree from which Davy Crockett
grinned the bark, thinking it was a coon.
The expert expressed his satisfaction with
the mine and 'in confidence' told the home
made expert that It was worth even more
than was asked for It. On his recom
mendation the deal was promptly closed,
but the only dividend the Eastern syndi
cate ever got was what came out of that
lone pillar and several thousand dollars
additional was spent in trying to locate
Ihe other six 'big faces of ore the Eastern
'expert' had reported. Since that zinc min
ing and 'experts," especially the latter have
fallen Into bad repute with a certain set
of Eastern capitalists."
CONTEMPORARY COMMENT.
Nesr York's School System.
From the Chicago TImea-Iterald.
The report of the board of education of
the city of New York shows that there ar
490 public school buildings within the
municipal limits-, that the teachers num
ber S.S44, that there are GS3.4T4 pupils
registered and that the average daily at
tendance Is 247,(70. The schools are di
vided Into training. 3; high, 13; elementary.
f!72, and truant, 2.
The report is the first that has been
issued for a full year since the consoli
dation of the Greater New York, and the
figures are, of course, unprecedented for
a single municipality." It Is estimated that
In order to keep pace with the rapidly
growing school population, which Increased
last year "by 27,234. It will be necessary
,to erect from fifteen to twenty-five new-
school houses each year.
There had been a great dearth of build
ings, but last spring the municipal author
ities issued bonds amounting to $7,627,640
for buildings, additions, sites and equip
ments and the work of construction has
been -going on rapidly since. During the
last school year there have been opened
nineteen new school, houses, containing 2sS
classrooms and seats for 18,077 pupils. This,
however. Is regarded" only as a start in
the right direction, and the board insists
that funds should be provided immediately
for improving fifteen sites already owned
by the city in the congested districts.
Out of the total expenditure of $15,310.
865.4S for the year. $1,219,049.14 was set oft
against receipts from the state, and the
money for a very large part of the re
mainder came from the sale of bonds,
since the sums received from the $7,627,640
Issue are nearly exhausted already. Thus
the tax is divided between the present and
future generations of property owners, and
as the future generations will get the
lion's share of the benefit out of the perma

ly be called inequitable.
The Gold Standard.
From the New York Times (Ind. Sem.).
ir the Republican caucus bill shall be
enacted Into law the gold standard will
be established in this country and there
will be no doubt about It. The title of
the measure declares that it is "a bill to
define and fix the standard of value." and
the first section fulfills the promise of the
title:
Section 1. That the standard unit of
value shall, as now, be the dollar, and shall
consist of twenty-five and eight-tenths
of gold, ntre-tenths fine, or twenty-three
and twenty-two one-hundredths grains of
pure gold, being the one-tenth part of the
eagle.
That Is plain English. There is no oc
casion to quote dictionary definitions to
prove that this language means the gold
standard. The act of 1S73 declared that
"the gold coins of the United States shall
be a one-dollar piece, which at the standard
weigth of twenty-five and eight-tenths
grains, shall be the unit ot value," etc
The dollar has always been our "unit" of
value. Those reckless Republicans who
have opposed any revision of the currency
laws because they wanted to keep the sil
v er Issue alive until their party could win
one more victory by it have insisted that
"unit of value" meant "standard of value."
Our neighbor, the Tribune, said not long
ago that "there is not a human being in
the world who doubts that gold Is now the
standard In this country." The trouble Is
that there are great numbers of persons
who doubt It. So long as we rest our gold
standard upon the ambiguous word "unit,"
yet describe one of our coins as the
"standard sliver dollar," there will be
doubt about the basis and standard of
measure of our currency.
The caucus bill removes all doubt. It is
as unmistakable as the language of the
British act of 1816, establishing the gold
standard in Great Britain, which declares
that "It Is expedient that the gold coin
made according to the Indentures of the
mint should henceforth be the sole stand
ard measure of value."

"I Intend to get rich" was the declara
tion of a 10-year-old lad born ninety-seven
years ago in a remote corner of "Warren
county, N. J. Yesterday that man died a
few miles distant from his birthplace, and
the record of his achievements in the in
dustrial and financial world reads more
like a fairy tale than the sober narrative
of unquestioned facts. In his 11th year the
lad was working in a country store, and
three years later he had the reputation of
knowing pretty well all that there was to
luiow about the business.
This farmer's son had a store of his own
at the age of 19, and It wasn't long until
he drifted into the business of building
railroads. He laid out eighty towns In the
AVest, and was connected in one way or
another with more than a score of rail
road companies, besides being at the head
of a big banking Institution. To churches
and charities and colleges he gave away
In his lifetime known sums aggregating
over $1,000,000. Once only did he present
himself for the suffrages of his fellow cit
izens) and that was thirty-one years ago,
when he was the unsuccessful candidate
for the governorship of New Jersey. He
was a keen Republican, though, and at

well directed effort at the accomplishment

"Lo" Lingers.
From the Chicago News.
Another cherished theme of the college
orator and essay writer the swift extinc
tion of the American Indian receives a
shock when studied in the light of statis
tics, the figures in the case coming from
the annual report of the secretary of the
interior. According to that document,
there are now 267,417 Indians in the United
States, while the census of 1S90 showed a
total aboriginal population of 249,473. "Poor
Lo" has evidently taken a fresh grip on
life and calmly and with exceeding stub
bornness refuses to "pass away with the
buffalo.""
A Lercl-neaded Democrat.
From the New York Sun.
General T. J. Churchill. Democrat and
sometime Governor of Arkansas, looks at
the Democratic situation with a clear and
therefore melancholy ee:
"The outlook for Democracy In the next
presidential election is gloomy, to say the
least. The recent elections have settled
two things, free silver and expansion. "We
cannot win on either ot these Issues."
But the Democratic party has no hope ot
winning. Its highest aspiration is that
after another tumble Bryan may be too
bruised to mount again.

- .HOPE ABANDONED.
I haie been to the funeral of all my hopes.
And Interred them one by one;
7ot a word was said, sot a tear was shed.
When the mournful task was done.
Stowly and sadly I turned me round.
And'aought my silent room.
And there alone, by the cold hearthstone,
I wooed the midnight gloom.
The dying embers on the hearth.
Care ont their Bickering light.
As If to say. "This is the way
Thy life ahall close in night."
Aad as the erening"s deepening shads
Lowered above my brow,
I went o-cr days when manhood's rays
Were brighter far than now.
I wept aloud In anguish sore
O'er the blight of prospects fair.
While demona laughed end eager qnatfed
My tears like nectar rare.
Through hell'a red halls an echo rang.
An echo load and long.
As In tho bowt I plungeit- my soul.
In the night of madness strong.
But here within the sparkling glass
I knew the cause to lie;
This all men own from zone to tone.
Yet millions drink and die.

THE CRICKET'S SONG (JAPANESE).
Here in my lonely cottage.
Now winter winds are cold.
I barken to the crickets.
And sigh that I am old.
I hear their small bells tinkle.
Like beads of silier rain
That break on the brooks In summer.
And dream I am young again.
I see my native rice fleids
Flushed with streams in spring.
And I hear the frogs, so many
The waters aeem to slag.
Sweet are the riven ot Settsu.
The rice streams sweetest of all.
For there alt day In the sunlight
The cherry blossoms' falL
Nothing falls here saTe asowoakes.
Blown from the wintry sky;
No light here save from emhen
That sullenly smoldering die:
No sound save the beila of my crickets.
Somewhere In the darkness rung.
And the sigh ot the poor old singer
For something that still Is young!

OP CURRENT INTEREST.
"Deacon" White Still on Earth.
"Just twelve years ago." said Hon. S. T.
(Deacon) White to a newspaper man in
Washington the other day. "I entered the
Fiftieth congress, and was at the time the
only Republican member from New York
city or Kings county. I am still a. Repub
lican, though no longer engaging In ac
tive political work. My Interest now lies
in considering what Is best for the wel
fare of the whole country. No one who has
studied the question without prejudice can,
hardly fall to arrive at the conclusion that
expansion Is the policy for this country
"We must look for outside markets unless
we are willing to undergo future crises in
finance and prolonged depressions in busi- '
ness. The reason Is obvious; It we sell
only at, home there will come in short or
der such a glut of products that prices will
fall, labor will have to be content with
half wages, and thousands will be thrown
out of employment, producing strikes and
general discontent. If wo wish to- keep
things moving in the brisk channel of to
day there must perforce be an outlet for
the surplus of our manufactures. This will
maintain prices, keep men at work, and
avert panics. On this mission the Repub
lican party seems to have entered, and as
long as it pursues such a. course It will
merit the confidence ot the voters of Amer
ica." John. Brown's Knife.
Joseph E. Chamberlain relates this story
of John Brown on the authority of Mrs.
George L. Stearns, widow of the wealthy
Bostonlan who supplied Brown with a large
portion of the funds for his campaigning:
Just as he was leaving for Harper's Ferry
he drew from his bootleg and presented to
Mr. Stearns as a personal memento a fine
bowle knife. Thl3 knife Mrs. Steams still
owns. Brown said it was bought by sub
scription for a Southerner, who was to
use it In taking the life of the veteran
abolitionist, but Brown in "one ot his Kan
sas fights captured the owner of the knife
and noticing the beautiful blade demanded
possession. The owner refused at flrst.
frankly admitting that the knife was given
to him "to put an end to your career with.
Captain Brown." "With a grim smile"
Brown grasped the handle and slung it on
his belt as he said: "Well, it seems that
the Almighty had other designs concern
ing It."
An Animal Cemetery.
One of the features of the pet dogishot
in New York served to Illustrate the ex
tent to which the fad ot wealthy people
for pet animals has been carried. This
exhibit was a plan In wood and grass ot
a national cemetery for all sorts ot pet
animals, located at Coxsackle, N. Y. The
cemetery idea was laughed at by those
who arc not enthusiastic owners of pets,
but that the latter take it seriously was
proved by one of the Society of Pet Own
ers, with which the scheme originated,
when he explained that already eighteen
plots had been taken by wealthy people,
most ot them New York women. Two
miles of avenues and walks are laid out
in the cemetery, and marble monumenta
to dogs, birds and horses dot this unlquo
graveyard.
