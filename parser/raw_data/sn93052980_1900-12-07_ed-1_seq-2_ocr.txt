COUNTY POLITICS.
■'■ 'Andrew Jackson, one of. America's most headstrong
patriots and, withal, a good old-fashioned President, as well
as a tough, unbending hickory Democrat, -enunciated" the
doctrine that "To the victor belongs the spoils."
Our county Democratic ring after steadfastly ".adhering
to this time-honored doctrine up to the^6th of 'November,
1900, came suddenly to the conclusion that this doctrine, was
not in tia'rniony with the present trend of events, and pro
ceeded to arrange matters for the incoming Republican Board
of Supervisors. But "the best laid schemes o'.mice and : men
gang aft aglee."
It is reported on .good authority that repeated efforts
were made by the Democratic "powers behind the throne" to
induce the holdover Republican member of the Board of
• Supervisors to consent to a "fix-up" of the appointive posi
tions by the outgoing Board, so as to tie the hands of the new
Board as far as these offices were concerned! In other words,
to usurp the just prerogative of the new Board and. dispense
the patronage that of right belonged to -it. The trap was
cleverly. laid and. the plans skillfully carried out until the
final throw,, when, to their utter dismay and political undo
ing, they found that no Republican would lend himself to
,- any such intrigue. The heretofore high-handed, rule or ruin
ring found itself up against the real thing, and such a humil
iating scramble for cover has seldom been witnessed, and to
this hour every leader of the besmirched party vociferously
and vehemently disclaims having anything to do with the
| disgraceful' affair.
Be that as it may, the Hospital Steward, County
Physician and at least one other officer were evidently asked
to resign, and the two former sent in their, resignations in
\ time to give the old Board a chance to accept them and fill
the vacancies ' thus occasioned, i These officials v who have
been well paid for their services by the people, would not con
tinue in office until the new Board was organized and had an
opportunity to fill vacancies after mature deliberation, and to
the best interest of taxpayers, but threw up their public trust
and demanded that their resignations be accepted and their suc
cessors be appointed at once. If they were not doing this at
the behests of the Democratic; intriguers and under great
pressure, and as part of the usurping scheme, nothing can
be judged by actions, and "actions speak louder than words.-ll
Clearly they should have remained in office until the people,
through their, chosen representatives, had a fair opportunity
to select other public servants to take their respective places,
and it is fair to presume that they would have acted the fair
and better part had they not been importuned to do otherwise.
All fair-minded men, be they Democrats or Republicans,
like fair play, and to , attempt thus to take "advantage, by
trickery, of the party which had fairly won the "battle of bal
lots/ and.been entrusted by the people with the management
of county affairs, not only merits the contempt of all good
citizens, but should and will sound ; the death-knell of the
1 Democratic ring that has so long controlled with a high hand
theaffairs "of Amador county.
The people of this county gave notice on Nov. 6th that
they had already. had all they^wanted of ring, rule, and' ; this
last piece of trickery will only serve to strengthen them in
their resolve to be rid of it forever. Gentlemen, the hand
■-■■ writing is on the wall; read it and prepare to step down and
-out gracefully when the day of righteous judgment arrives.
THE PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE.
• . _- ptig , : „ — -•:;:■-■ ■ - ■
["'President McKinley's message is a businesslike docu-
I ment in which foreign affairs are handled in a masterly
manner. No one can fail to admire the high statesmanship
displayed all through the Chinese and other crises.
,"•:,* The message in its discussion of financial affairs of great
importance is very strong and all that could be desired. The
Nicaragua canal matter might have been couched in rather
more emphatic terms, but the reiteration of the necessity of
ratifying the Hay-Pauncefote treaty shows plainly enough
.i that the. President is in line "with "the enterprise for we cannot
build the canal, without being guilty of gross bad faith, uptil
said treaty is ratified. :-'/
The President strongly recommends : the j laying of the
Pacific cable, and this recommendation will doubtless have
the desired effect on Congress.
k-jjy r. As a whole, the message justly takes rank with the 1
ablest documents of the kind on record.
•It is understood that later President McKinley will, in a
message, make a strong plea for the immediate con
struction of the Nicaragua canal.
DON'T GET RATTLED.
f:.?4"WJb°m the. Gods destroy they first make : mad." It
would seem that the Gods are after the Democratic managers
of Amador county. 7 For the sly and foxy manipulators of
Democratic ring politics had surely gone mad when they
planned the little game that was played with such effrontery
at the last meeting of the Board of Supervisors.
That performance will add hundreds of votes to the^ Re
publican ticket at the next election;: -Our Democratic office
holders, are hastening to say: "I had nothing to do with; it."
Now, don't get rattled, gentlemen, it will all come out in good

Paulley In Alaska.
S. M. Paulley. who was an employe
of Tom Chichizola for three years, one
year of which period he was foreman
at the sawmill, left Amador county in
1898 for the gold fields of Alaska.
When he left for the north he was
afflicted with -rheumatism, but after
experiencing a winter in Alaska where
at times the thermometer marked 76
and 82 degrees below zero, the rheu
matism left him entirely and he has
not felt a twinge of It since.
j Mr. Paulley returned here about two
weeks ago, hale and hearty and brim
full of faith in Alaska where he will re
turn next April, to continue work on
valuable claims which he owns in con
junction with Charles IL Rogers, a
brother of Lieutenant Rogers, who is
in command of the military post at
Circle City. His claims are on Harri
son Creek, about 70 miles from Circle
City, and he says most claims there
are good for frooi $12 to $16 a day per
man. One of his claims yielded 267
ounces in 71 days. All ■ work is done
by sluicing, and Mr. Paulley will take
back with him a small hydraulic ontfit
to be used in the'work. He says that
one of the best things that ever hap
pened to him was his pilgrimage to the
El Dorado of the north.
During his first year there he worked
for the government and took the cen
sus along the Yukon river. This gave
him an excellent opportunity to get
posted relative to the ; ins and outs of
the country and resulted in his acquir
ing valuable holdings.
In Circle City he met Dr. and, Mrs.
Hatch, formerly of Jackson, and the
acquaintance has continued ever since.
He says that Dr. Hatch is the contract
physician, under government, at
Rampart, Alaska, and that he is half
owner, with ex-Gov. McGraw of the
State of Washington, of very valuable
mining claims.
