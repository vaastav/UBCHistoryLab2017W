J hae a perfect right to remove a Dep

sidered "Rood form" In politics to
'notify a superior of such action.
William W. Smith is a personal

"Although O'Malloy told tho Gov

charging only 2 cents a pound or 2
cents a can us an overhead charge, he
put 7 cents on prunes, dried fruits
and other articles that represented a
profit of CO 2-3 per cent., which was
tin outrageous plcco of profiteering.
That tho food still reached tho public
at a low price was only beuauiic tho
vernment price was so low.

This Is because the shortage Is In
bituminous, not anthracite coal,
and anthracite is the mainstay
of tho city.
Most of the big lighting plants-,

are run by anthracite, and U Is
predicted that thcro will bo plenty

vlca purposes. Broadway may bo
dimmed, but nobody's home or

forting statements from experts:

Association; "The eastern terri-.
tory Is plentifully supplied with
the smaller sized anthracite."
Hums Brothers: "If tho pcoplo

enough to got a truck over to

SUMMARY OF THE PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE
GENERAL recommendations on legislation to combat Uio cost of
living, labor unrost, radicalism nnd a readjustment of tho nation,
to peaco tlmo baijts wero tho features of President Wilson's
annual message to Congress dcllvevrcd today;
Tho Peace Treaty, tho President told Congress, will bo discussed In
a ecparato message later, as wfll the railroad question.
A great portion of tho message was devoted to a discussion of the
condition and rights of labor. A definite programmo to bring about an
Improvement In the conditions of labor and bring nbout a genuine
democratization of Industry is recommended.
"Tho only way to keep men from agitating against grievances Is to
removo tho grievances," said tho President's message. At another
point It declared "tho seed of rovoluUon Is repression."
The establishment of the principles regarding labor laid down in
tho covenant of tho Leaguo of Nations, said Uio message, offers us tho
way to Industrial peaco and conciliation. No other road lies open to
us. Governments must rccognlzo tho right of men to bargain collec
tively for humane objects. Labor must no longer bo treated as a
commodity.
"Tho right of indltlduals to strike Is -Inviolate,'' conUnoed the mol
es fre, wnnd ought not to bo interfered itIUi by any proccii of Goiern
ment, but Utcra Is a predominant right and that if the right ot tho
Gorernment to protect nil Its pcoplo and to assert lis power and
majesty against the challenge of any class."
Tho President was referring to tho Government's recent InJuncUon
- against the coal strike.
"There are those In this country," said tho message, "who threaten
direct action to force their will upon a majority. It makes tltUe dif
ference what minority It Is; whether capital or labor, or any other
class; no sort of prlvtlego will over bo permitted to dominate this
country. Those who would propose any other method of reform
aro enemies of this country. Let those bowaro who. take tho shorter
road to disorder and revolution."
The mcssago recommends passago of laws now proposed by the
Attorney General for dealing with Uic Reds. s
The President recommends a simplification of lncomo and excess
profits taxes; establishment of a national budget system; legislation to
secure employment and land for sorvice men; laws to encouraga In
creased crop production) legislation to reduce tho cost of living, and
extension of the Lever Act; laws to bring about democratization ot
Industry, Including participation of workers In decisions affecting their
wclfaro; protection for America's new chemical and dyestuffs Indus
try; Federal aid In the building of good roads; development of forest
resources.

Revision of Income Taxes and for

WAB11WQT0N, Dee. is Tho menage teitl to Congrct by President
Wilton to-day, and read by clerks in the two Home, it a iolloict,:
"To the Senate and House of Repiesentatlvcs:
" sincergly regret that I canot be present at the opening of this ses
sion of Congress, I am thus prevented from presenting In as direct a
way as I could wish the many questions that are pressing for solution at
this time. Happily I have had the
of the several executive departments,
affairs in their detail and whose thoughtful recommendations I earnestly
second.
"In the matter of the railroads and the readjustment of their affairs
growing out of Federal control, I shall take the liberty 'at later date of
addressing you.
CALLS FOR A BUDGET SYSTEM.
"I hope that Congress will bring to a conclusion at this session legfc
lalion looking to the establishment of a budget system. That there should
be one single authority responsible for the making of all appropriations
and that appropriations should be made not Independently of each other,
but with reference to one single comprehensive plan of expenditure prop
erly related to the nation's income, there can be no doubt.
"1 believe the burden of preparing the budget must, in the nature ol
the case, if the work is to be properly done and responsibility concen
trated Instead of divided, rest upon the Executive. The budget so pre
pared should be submitted-to and approved or amended by. a single com
mittee of each house of Congress, and no single appropriation should be
made by Congress, except such as may have been Included in the budget
prepared by the Executive or added by the particular committee of Con
gress charged with the budget legislation.
"Another and not less Important aspoct of the problem la tho ascer
tainment of the economy and efficiency with whldh tho moneys appropri
ated arc expended. Under existing law tho only audit Is for tho purpose
of ascertaining whother expenditures havo been lawfully mado within the
impropriations.
"Nu one is authorized or equipped to ascertain whether the money
has been spent wisely, economically and effectively. The auditors should

J subsequent administration, and authorized and oinpoweml to examine into
