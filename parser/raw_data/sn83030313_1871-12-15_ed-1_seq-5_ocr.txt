At an early hour rumors were actively cir

lions whose Insolvency excited suctt

Iras startling, and a fooltug of uuei.sluess and

WHAT MR. OALLINDOR HAYS.
rinesday evening a reporter of the Newark
caned on Mr. caiieuder. who uvea
; ?'.?v.::./'".-1..;-;
u ?
Ml Wewsrlr, and via Informed thai "in
September, when lie eerUtied mat me
hank wae In a flow-taking condition, it
was all right. Its present difficulty arises from a
ffofd
falling off of deposits, and an indebtedness incurred
within me last two montns, and a lailnre to realise
from securities which are not Immediately availa
ble. >
It was reported In Newark that a Deputy Sheriff
had a summons for Mr. Callander to appear at
Trenton m relation to a claim for $40,000 held
against buo by the Merchante' National Hank of
that city; but il tuts be trne the summons has not
been served, as Mr. Cullender was in mis city yes
terday as usual.
Mr. Davis reports tbat the Ooean Bank will not
again resume business, and it is not likely that any
of Hie suspended institutions will do so.
Meeting of the Depositors.
A meeting of the depositors of the Ocean National
Bank was held yesterday at the office of Mr. llod
noat, on Church street, to consider what steps
should be taken, In view of tne suspension or the
Institution. There was a very large attendance,
the room In which the meeting was held being alto
getber insufficient to accommodate those who came
together. The proceedings were opened oy Mr.
Everett, one of the callers of the meeting, wno
nominated Mr. Wandell for chairman, which was
carried. Mr. 8. A. Walker was appointed secretary.
Mr. Evkrbtt said that, as the caller of the meet
ing, some statement of the poaltion or affairs in
connection with the bank would naturally be ex
pected from blm. His sole object in calling me
meeting was to get the depositors together and
decide upon some course of action to be Immedi
ately taken. The first question to be decided la
whether the depositors are satisfied with the re
ceiver who haB been appointed, M. J, Davis.
Personally he was assured there could be
no fault found wt.h hlin, bat as the at
torney of the bank and an Intimate friend
or the President, his appointment was open
to grave doubt. It is also strange that a
lawyer should have been selected for me position;
a business man, one wonld think, from his knowl
edge ol accounts, wonld be the proper person. It
was understood Mr. Davis had given buudB la
? ioo.uuo, but that was small security lor the custody
oi $d,o;iO,ooo. However, U the meeting was satisfied
wit;i the receiver, there was notulng to be said, and
fie would probably discharge Ills duties (airly. Tho
next inquiry Is to ascertain how tbe accounts of the
bank
IIAVE PERM MUDDLED UP
in suofi a way as they have been to mystify
tnc depositors, liow the bank came to fall, if tho
statement turuishcd by the officers to the press be
trae, is inconceivable. They assert that tlioy huvo
a nurpius ol over one million dollars more lhau
tiioir liabilities, and yet iho company went into
bankruptcy for $17,000. We must see how tho offi
cers of'the bank used tho money for their own per
sonal purposes. I f tney nave not, then what uas
ae of 1"
become of the cash P We have a right to know where
our money has gene to, and what purposes it hus
been applied, ana IT me company bas vio.ated its
sacred (rust, then, t>j all means, let proper Duuish
uieut be dealt out
TO rng GUILTY PARTIES.
The way the business ol the bank lias been con
ducted recently lias, upon investigation, turned cut
to be very reprehensible. It is asserted that the
Matements have been hashed up and made to suit
the purposes of the officers; that the weekly reports
to tne Clearing House
1IAY IS BEEN FALSIFIED,
and the spurious and worthless checks of other
companies been represented as cash or greenbacks.
11 the company fists been guilty of tfiia base
ness It Is most despicable, and we can be
lieve auy story told of it after such an assertion.
The securities which appear iu the staiemcut
as good cannot be guaranteed as such.
For instance, the Canal fortago bonds. No one can
tell anything about what they are worth or whether
they are w-orta anything; but U is surmised that
they arc of little or no value, and the bank, by hold
ing them, has been lalse to its trust. It is reported
that Mr. Davis and Mr. OoUender bom hold the
bonds, but the truth of tills cannot be ascertained.
Another instance of tbe manner lu which things
have been going on:?A gentleman made a large
Mondaj * " "
deposit on Monday In tne bank, being Ignorant, of
course, mat it was about to fall. The money was
received bv tho cashier, though he knew perfectly
well mat the bank was insolvent at the time. Legal
advice has been taken and tho act of the Ocean
Dank pronounced
A CLEAR CAM OF FRAUD.
Overdue notes are also held by the bank whloh
are still represented aa good, though every oue
knows them to be valueless. Many other securities
were bonds of tbe New York Printing company to
the amount of $100,000. Mr. Tweed's name appears
as oue or the directors, though It is asserted mat he
has never attended the meetings or tne^oard; bnt
wo all know that he never joined a corporation
without sucking the
LIFBBLOOD OUT OF IT.
Mr. Kvirett concluded by Impressing upon the
depositors united action, as they had a powerinl
corporation to light.
Judge White said his position was more humor
ous man otherwise. About a month since he got
rid of an insolvent concern by Its suspension. Fif
teen days ago, on the advice or a friend, ne opened
an account with the Ocean Bank, and be is now in
a suspended state again. He wonld nrge that no i
hasty action be taken in this important matter, aa
too spasmodic exoitomenv which prevails in finan
cial circles renders it very difficult to got at the true
state of affairs. The action of the Clearing Hons*
was also, In a certain sense, injurious, as it enabled
the great banks, In many instances, to swallow up
tbe small ones. He offered the following resolu.
Hon:?
Resolved, Tbet a committee of fire, two of whom shell be
the chairman end secretary of this mectlne. be appointed to
repreaenl the depotitors and put thermal ret in communica
tion with the receiver, and tbat they make, with bl? oonient,
an examination of the securities end condition of the
Ucean flunk and report to this body of depositors at a future
meeliof.
Tbe resolution of Jnuge White was put to the
meeting by the Chairman, and unanimously carried.
Mr. Everett, Colonel siorrs and M. J. A. Martin
wcro appointed as tbe committee, and subse
quently M. W H. fluids, aa one of the
largest depositors of the bank, was
added to it It was expected that Mr.
Knncnar, one of tbe dlreotors or the bank, wonld
have l>eeu present to afiord some lu formation; but
though he was several times called lor tailed to put
m an appearance. Tne meeting adjourned until
Monday, at ten o'clock, when the committee la ex
pected to report. The place of meeting will be tbe
Mechanics' Exchange, Park place.
Colonel st or is was then appointed to wait npon
Mr. Davis and ascertain If ne would receive tne
committee, lie readily oonsented to do so, and tne
interview will take place to-morrow morning at ten
o'clock.
The Union Hqunre Bank.
Everything was quiet at tuts bank yesterday, de
positors leeUngBatlsfled that at the proper time they
would receive all that is due them. The directors
and the receiver were busy all day examining the
books, but so far can only form an approximate
estimate 01 the Indebtedness. Vice President filxby
last evening placed the bills receivable at $873,103,
and liabilities at about $827,ooo. As yet they have
not received the sheet from tne Clearing House,
and cannot consequently get at the exact
figures. Tney nave, however, other assets, in
cluding $60,000 In currency and $02,000 in
bonds, wortn, with the premium, $70,oou. Then
they have In claimB on leal estate, as collateral
security, and a olaim which Is not yet adjusted,
about twenty thousand dollars, and $i4,ooo lu
cash Items, a great deal of wntch Is In currency.
Mr. Ulxby, therefore, believes the condition of tho
bank as about as lollows:?
LIABILITIES.
Total liabilities about $327,coo oo
rills receivable $373,133 01
Currency 60,ooo oo
Bonds 70,ooo oo
Collateral not adjusted 20,000 oo
Cash Items 14,000 00
Total $627,103 01
Liabilities 327,003 00
Assets over liabilities $200,103 01
"Assuming," said Mr. Bixoy, "that lu any proba
ble event fiu.ooo ot our paper should not no paid?
au eventuality 1 do not look lor and I do not
apprehend that all of It should not be paid?I do
not see wny we cannot pay every depositor all tnat
h due mm and eacU stockholder seventy-five per
ccul on tua present mock. That is allowing for the
fact that onr business is boing wound up by^ a
stranger, who has not the facilities for realizing as
much as the directors. A gcutlcm&u, a capitalist,
to-day stated that if we resinned business he would
put in tlco,eoo, so satisfied was ho with tho caution
exercised In lu management." The reporter was
lnioruicu that Mr. iluiburd authorized tho receiver
to raako out and publish a statement of the bank's
strain.
The Eighth National Bunk.
No further developments were made yesterday at
this bunk. Tho receiver (Mr. A. Man) Is busily en
gaged upon an examination of Its affairs. Mo has
not yet been able to arrive at any satisfactory esti
mate or the liabilities of the bank, but says that, so
far as he has gone, he finds no reason to doui|t the
assertion of tne officers that the depositors will be
paid lit lull.
He believed that a large amount of the funds
of the bank had been invested in real estate,
but was not prepared to say whether or not the
arbitrary sale or the proporty would cause serious
loss. lie knew nothing about tho rumors of specu
lations by ihe President, and expressed his unwiil
lnguess to answer questions until he mnde himself
more conversant with all tne facts in the case.
What Comptroller ffnrlbard Nays.
A Herald reporter about noon yesterday met
Comptroller or the Currenoy Huribnrt at the office
of tlie ocoan National Bank and made inquiries as
to the rumor thai lie Is a brother-in-law of Exami
ner Cullender.
"lie is not a relative of mine," said the Comptrol
ler; "but he was long a clerk In the Washington
office, and there proved to be a most trnstcd and
deserving official. The events that have transpired
tn tut* city and fits connection with the bans# Is M
much s surprise to me as to the clearing Bouse
and banking circles. I think, though, that the
Sresa are entirely too severe in their criticisms ot
Ir. Gallender. I am uot a politician, and my once
is one entirely removed trom pontics."
?'l have heard," said tne reporter, "that you have
appointed a committee to lnqniro into Mr. t;alien
der'H relations to the banks. When will tueir re
port ne ready T"
"I have not appointed a committee, bnt the Clear
ing House will."
?'By your suggestion?"
"Yes, at my request. 1 felt that it was proper
that the most thorough inquiry be instituted, and
asked the Clearing Bouse to make it by a commit
tee."
"Have there been aay further suspensions to-day ?"
"None. 1 think they are all rlgut now."
" Bow about the Tenth National 1"
"Well, it is pretty certain that a ran can't affect
them."
"Yon, doubtless, read m the Ukrald this morn
ing the statement of the directors oi tne Union
Bquare National Bank. Is It correct?"
"It Is, probably. The bank was a good one, hut
wheu it was unable to meet lis obligations through
its clearing agents 1 had no alternative but to ap
point a receiver. This is the case with all. When
a bank is nnable to meet its obligations, irom what
ever cause, I am compelled to put In a receiver."
"What is your opinion of the condition of the
banks, so lar as you have investigated their
uffhlrs r*
"That the trouble is over, and no more suspen
sions are likely to occur. 1 leave lor Washington
to-night lu consequence."
"How far does Mr. Calender's district extend
merely New Y ork city, or is Brooklyn included ?"
"lie covers the banks of Brooklyn and New
York."
Tlie Action si the .shoe and Leather Bank.
Mr. Stoat, the President or the Shoe and Leather
Bank, states that the directory of the Union Sqaure
National Bank have somewhat misstated to the
Herald the actnal facts in reference to the action
of the shoe and Leather Bank. Mr. stout says that
the night previous to the suspension of tho bank he
was applied to to clear for tnem by the Union. After
certain inquiries he told tuem that it taev would
doposit $100,000 he would clear lor them; they
gave him $114,000 then and on the lollowing
morning (Wednesday) ihcy sent him $A00j more,
making (47,000. Tne run was continuing and he
went to the Union Bank and saw the President aud
one oi the directors. Mr. Stout made some in
quiries of these gentlemen, and, having received
what he thougnt were saiisiactory answers, he told
them that it tney would give lnm ihelr individual
responsibility ho would carry tuem through. These
geutlemon declined to do this. Mr. Stout expressed
ills great surprise mat they would not guuraatce
their own bank, and declined to render any assist
ance, except ou full and sattafaoiorr guarantees.

Excitement In Newark ftaukiag and Rati

A 940.000 Suit ArrIum llim.
The excitement In Newark banking and business
circles over tho association of Mr. calender's name
with the bnrst-np Ocean bank Is much greater than
in New York, lor the simple reason that not only is
be a well-known and heretofore highly respected
resident, but is Just now implicated in an important
financial trespass suit In the Supreme
Court of the State. He is comparatively
young and resides at No. 83 Fulton street,
Newark, and Is Superintendent of the First Baptist
Sunday School. During the war he served as major
on the staff of General Weitael, and at its close se
cured the position or bank examiner for New York
and New Jersey. Five years ago he became exami
ner for New York alone, deriving his antuonty
irom the Secretary ot the Treasury. Since the
Ocean Bank denouement It has leaked out in New
ark that he was In some way liable to the Mer
chants' National Bank of that place. When applied
to lor information on the subjeot oy a reporter the
President. Mr. James L. Hayes, at first
said he knew nothing about tne matter,
but finally admitted that mere might bo something
in it, though he believed It was grossly ex
aggerated and misstated. Subsequently Courtland
Parker, a lawyer, who is also a director ol the bank,
was applied to for information, bat ne became
greatly agitated ana declared It was a subjeot which
tbe press had no right to inquire into; it was en
tirely a private matter, a civil suit. He prepared A
statement, wnlcn was published lu the local papers
yesterday, to the following effect;?Mr. Cullender
"is sued as one of five soverai parties who
endorsed a note held by the Merchants'
National Bank, but the debt is not his other
than as a fourtn endorser, and It is largely and
abundantly secured oy collaterals. The salt, which
is In the Supremo Courr, happened to be brought
contemporaneously with the failure of the Ocean
Bank, but bas no connection with its charter. Nor
Is it brought to recover any such amount as staled.
If any such sum Is named in a win It u simple
rormallty."
That such sum Is named in a writ seems to be
beyond pcradventure, as the following copy of a
document served on Mrs. Calicnder on Wednesday

The friends or Baron Geroit, late German Minister
to the United States, h&vo made a fitting testimony
of the respeot of liberal Americans for a pure*
minded diplomat and amiable gentleman whose
official relations with us continued uninternptcd
for a quarter or a century, during which time he
enjoyed, without a Jar, the respect of our govern
ment and people. The present, which la com
plimentary to tbe taste o( the donors wil,l doubtless
be acceptable to the Baron, consists ot a very
elegant epergne of solid sterling silver, thirty-eight
Inches high and very massive. line case is oi plain
burnished silver; from it rise tnree richly chased
standards supporting a central shaft, on wnich,
at the height or about twenty-eight inches.is a richly
ornamented disk fliteen and a half inches m
diameter, lined with gold. Ou the wide border of
this disk at regular intevvals are three round medal
lions. On ono (handsomely chased in relief) Is the
coat of arms of the United Uermany; on another
the coat of arms ol the United States, wuile the
third bears the following inscription:?
To Baron Frorterieh Von (1-rolt, tbe fahhrnl rrpreeeutn lre
of hit loverelgii and peoihr, wtioee moral excellence and un

Prom the ceutre of the fruit bowl there rises a
candelabrum wun three branches, wtiile Just bciow
the large bowl there projects three richly orna
monted branches, each one bearing a gold lined
dish, corresponding in style with tho large central
one. The most urtistio part or the whole ailair, and
taat requiring most cure ana labor in tne execu

threo lull length statuettes ol solid sliver, each six
inches high and most beautifully modelled. One
represents the Goddess of Liberty, one a United

other a Prussian soldier, also rally aruied and

COMPTROLLER C:NN0LLY'3 CASE.
The public offices yesterday presented a much
more lively appearance than they did during some
few days past. The pleasant, bracing weather may
have had sometnlng to do with bringing about
this change, and then it was known
that the special committee of the Board
of Aldermen would present a report
il relation to the railroad running on Fourth ave?
nne, above the Grand Central depot; also that Mr.
Oady, Clerk of Arrears in tbo Department of
Flnanoe, was to sell property on account of arrears
01 taxes and water rents outstanding since 1105,
and also that a number of employes in various de
partments would be paid off Before noontide the
flow of callers was toward
THE COMITROLLBR'S OFFICE,
as here the sales of property for arrears and the
payment of employees were to take place. Many
or tnose who owned property on which arrearages
had been allowed to accumulate harried to the
office at "the eleventh hour," paid up tue amounts
charged against them, and thus wived their
property from going nnder the hammer. Jnat at
noon Mr. Cad7 commenced
TUB SALE.
The terms of sale were such as are usnally made
in similar cases?for the lowest term or years all
arrearages, costs and cnarges on the property; the
buyer to take possession in six mouths. Commenc
ing at the First ward Mr. Ca ly soul all tiio property
noticed for sale in the seven lower warts?
some 407 pieces In all?with arrears on them
from $5 to $800. Among the owners of property
sold appear tbe names of Fernando Wood, Terence
Farley, John T. Henry, R. L. A A. Stuart, J. B. A
W. W. Coruell, Edward Burke and the Gardner,
Lojrgett and W. K. Burton estates.
To-day the sale wJl commence with the Eighth
ward, aud will be continued irom day to day uutll
the entire twenty-two wards have been gone through
with. In regard to the
PAYMENT OF LABORERS,
it Is but fair tostato that Comptroller Green has
provided all along for tho payment or tho poor men
who-e claims were just, who had actually done their
work, aud that now there were none sintering for
money except those who nud been depeuding on
sinecures, and whose claims conld net be honestly
audited or allowed. He has succeeded, farther, in
making arrangements dy which the real working
men In the several departments miy be enabled
to reoelve their pay regularly and folly, und he
has determined to cat off the drones who have
been feeding and fattening in the public hives.
Yesterday he transmitted to the Department of
Public instruction tne sum or $170,o<>o, to die De
partment of Parka $75,000, and had despatched the
City Paymaster with the necessary luuds to )ay off
tbe workmen employed on the Crolon Aqtednct
throughout the entire length of forty or more tunes.
IN TUB COUNTY UURKAU
consternation and trepidation stiu exist. Several of
tho attaches have already been dropped, anong
others Mr. Moloney, who has been In the dsoait
meat for several years. Charles Underwood OUou
nell is still retained, and Mr. ureen has
shown bis gooJ sense In announcing tbe tact
that Mr. (fConnell will bo retained at all
events, inasmuch as be was not a partisan ap
pointee, and has steadily and conscientiously per
formed the duties assigned him. borne of the others
may be continued in office, but they win bo trans
ferred, and the bureau lteelf abolished, so as to
place the auditing of accounts for both city aid
county under one head. At the other department
centred in the Mew Court House there was littlo or
no excitement.

Boston, Dec. 18,1871.
M orders and snlcldes are not or very common
occurrence In the quiet villages of New England,
and wnon one snob does occur It is generally accom
panied by circumstances of suob a singular nature
as to render It of more than common Interest;
Littleton, Mass., twenty-six miles north of (his city,
on the Fitchourg Railroad, was ihe scene yesterdar
afternoon of a fearful slaughter, comoluing murder
wan suicide, and attended by such accessories and
such fiendish brutality In its conception and execu
tion as to cardie tbo biooa with horror. News of
the dreadful occnrrence was brought to this city by
passengers over 'he Fitch burg road t his morning,
and trom their statements the following doscriptlon
of the fearful tragedy and its circumstances are
obtained:?
Patrick Keating has for some years resided in the
southern portion of Littleton, long enongh to be the
parent of four childreu and to have earned a very
lair reputation lor good behavior among his trlends
aud associates. Patrick was a Our laborer in the
town, working steadily at Lis business and provid
ing, as well as tits limited meaus would allow, for
the comfort of his family.
Until wlihlu a lew months, too, he hns been a
man 01 steady haults, seldom, if ever, indulging to
> the use of intoxicating liquors aud generally behar.
I lug himself as a good husband and lather. Lately,
| however, tils conduct has changed. He became
more uud more addicted to stroug drink, and was
! morose and irrltunle In his treatment of his children
and his wife. There wcro
UAKD WORDS ON BOTH SIDES,
froqnent criminations and recriminations, until tho
svcial condition of the family had bccomo degraded
to a very low ebb. Every day lucreasod the sum of
their uubapptness, until the mother, who was In a
delicate situation, fell that tt woulu be Impossible
for her to longor remain tn the house. She broached
the subject of a separation to her husband a week
ago, but was met in such a contrite manner that
sue did not press tho mAtter to uu issue. Patrick
pledged himself Immediately to commenco the
work of reformation tn his nablts, and spoke pa
thetically of tho sad condition of t:te children,
who would thus be left to grow up without a
mother's care. Mrs. Keating finally yielded to
his entreaties, and promised to remain. For a day
or two Patrick was trne to his pledge to reloriu;
out tbo temptations of a dissolute course of
lue were too strong for him to mako a success
ful resistance, aud he soou returned to his old
tiablis. Tho poor wife was finally forced, in spite of
herself, to obey the Instincts or self-preservation and
declaro her tntentlou to repair to her lather's house.
This occurred yesterday mo.oing. Mrs. Keating,
after iranaly stating the uuiuro of the c.i3c to her
husband, said that she could live with idm no Ion
I ger aud that
I THET MOST SEPARATE
I at once. This declaration was met with a torrent
of rcproacties and abuse. Patrick denied her right
to leave him without the warrant of a Court, aud
asserted that he would use force. If It wcro neces
sary, to prevent her departure. They indulged In a
wordy quarrel lor a few moments, until, very niucn
incensed, Keating rushed out ol the house, Tuenco
be repaired to the lionte of a rricud In tho
village, where he procured some liquor and
drauk deeply, with ttio vain luteiuion of quiet
lug his passions. Rut, as Is usual in such eases
the liquor wlilcu ho poured down his throat only
served to intensify tits rage, and caused dim to be all
the more firm in his determination thai, hu wlfo
should not live away from his home. Ilcro it Is
thought that be determined on the commission of
the crime for which he is now In cu.'dody. in the
excited state of his feelings, with tne recollection of
bis past misconduct orov.ding upon his min i, and
the dismal iorehodliigs or the future which tic must
have inevitably experienced, murder and suic.de
lost all their terrors to his mind. and a cre looked
upon only as ine speediest relief irom his present
troubles. Ue was literally half-cra/cd wlih rum
and grew more nnd more desperalo us he thought
over the calamities which ho had brought up uu him
sell by a continued course of vicious comiucr. At
noon he reiurncd to bis house, only ro find inat his
wife nad packed up scino of nor clothes nud was
only wailing to bid film larcwell before going a why.
THE RIIRDEH.
Ho asked her If she was still detcrrnlnod to lcavo
lilm and the children to tako eare of themselves.
Mho replied that ahe had no other alternative,
whereupon Pairlca drew a revolver from his pocket,
and, with the exclamation, ?uod forgive me I" he
discharged It at her breast. The murdered woman
fell unconscious 10 the floor, while a copious stream
of blood rushed from tho wound. Patrick gazed a
moment at tho dreadful sight, and thin turning the
muzzle or tho pistol towards his own rody, dts.
charged It again. An hour afterwards a neighbor
entered Hie iionso and lound both upon ihe door,
weltering in gore. The floor was covered with pud
dles of blood, and the dying ones, although still
breathing heavily, were in au unconscious state.
About tho bodies stood the afllic'ed children of
the Tamily, struck almost duuio bv the
calamity, and scarcely realizing the extent of their I
loss. The body ol Mrs. Keating was placed upon a
bed In an adjoining room, ami her husband was
placed under arrest aud removed to the Poor House
in the town lor sato keeping. It Is scarcely possi
ble mat either ot tuoiu win recover.
There Is a great deal ot excitement In tho vlllngo
concerning the tragedy. It being :ui rvnt altogether
without precedent in that locality, and the com
ments are many and various. Although Hie purlins
connected therewith belonged to tho lower classes
of society, still mere Is a general feeling of sym
pathy Willi the children thin loft without anaiuntl
protector, which will probably as-uiuc a <iii<sinmial
form. The tragedy forms tno sole subject of conver
sation in Mtileion.

The fail ore of Brfgham Young to appear and

Eh has, however, by a very dangerous ruse, beeq
successful for iho moment.
The recent appointment of George C. Rates, of
Chicago, as United States District Attorney, was a
very fortunate and timely appointment, as il
relieved the Court and the Acting District
Attorney from the charge of "seeking to persecute
the servant oi the Lord." Mr. Rates enters upon
his duties pcrrectiy free from oil personal bias. It
Is not surmised that he la either a Mormon worship

TUB COCIIT.
It is not a little funny tluu Brlgham Young should
Dud refngo under tho legal wing of Charles H.
Hempstead, who was formerly regarded by "the
head of the Church" as his worst onemy; but sucit
are the old man's difficulties that ho ts glad enough
to forget the past If tho future can ouly bo secured
to him In peace. Hempstead was lormerly editor of
the Union VMeitr, a paper that fought Brtgham'a
copperhead proclivities all through tho war, and,
remembering the keen, H'-atliing exposure or Hemp
stead's pen, he ji'dged it prudent to engage hliu as
the bead of the defeuce.
'ihe first act of the District Attorney wan to call
up the case of The People vs. Hrlghaui Young, and
as he was not present, that his recognizance bo for*
felted. The pleading of tho defence was lame anil
unsatisfactory; bnt, as the whole country woe in
terested In his trial, the Court exhibited a leniency
that disarms tho Mormon press anil pulpit of every
semblance of pretext for their cry of persecution.
It wa3 finally agreed that the oth day of January,
1872, be fixed for tins a*?use o-'/dhtv. This was a
concession ol the Court that no one expectod; bat
scoklug to impress upon the - Mormon peoplo
that U was the determination of the govcrment to
annihilate polygamy, and not to sock revenge.

This is the absorbing topic ol conversation and

Now what can ho do? llo has said scores of times

is making a great change and promises to be largely

In the mines west of Ibis city have organized and
commenced operations to build forty miles of rail
road, in order to join iho Utah Koutbcrn Iiailro.nl
and thus couuect with New York. The great mines
will keep open the roads in the canyons ail winter
by tne constant transportation of ores. The southern
Hue of rnllroud is now wltlilu two miles or tattle
Cottonwood, and nt the Sandy Station there is nn
immense business growing up. At the station
in ibis city one company ha- plied up 2+) car loads

freight agent says that ho has forwarded wltrnu

other mtues springing in'o notice promising to bo
