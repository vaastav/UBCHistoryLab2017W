Expect Riot and Bloodshed.
GOLDFIELD, Dec. 5. T.ie news that
Governor Sparks has called upon the
government to have troops ready for
use in Goldfield on a moment's call to
restore order was heard in this com
munity with amazement this morning,
and everyone is t'ing to find an ex
planation. "It was not supposed that
tho Btrike situation had reached such
an acute stage as to require such a pre
caution. On the surface. Goldfield is as quiet
as on a holidaj'. There is very little
talk on the Btreots and no agitation
whatever. Thc pcoplo gcnerallj' accept
thc news as meaning that tho mines
arc preparing to open up with non-union
miners. t If this is undertaken, the gen
eral opinion is that there will be riot
and bloodshed. Tho having of troops
in readiness, therefore, is only a pre
cautionary measure. Neither side is
giving out any information, their plans
being guarded with thc utmost Becrecy.
Minors Steal Powder.
GOLDFIELD, Nov., Dec. o. Thc
Mine Owners' committee, which ad
vised Governor Sparks to make thc re
quest for federal troops, states that it
is only a precautionary measure, sug
gested by the recollection of the ter
rors of the Cripple Crock and Cocur
d'Aleno strikes. The mine owners arc
preparing to start up with non-union
miners. As this camp is strongly
unionized and led by desperate agita
tors,, driven from one state and one
camp to another, tho attempt to resumo
operations as an open camp will natu
rally bo resisted. Non-union infers
will have to be imported and a con
flict will surely occur.
That the miners have been quietly
but industriously preparing for trouble
is evidenced by tho fact that thev have
500 stands of arms in their quarters.
Last night a large quantity of powder
was stolen from tho Booth mine, and
other depredations are taking place in

LAST CURTAIN FALLS
Of CLARA BLBuDGOOD
Famous Actress Shoots Herself
Before Performance at
Hotel in Baltimore.
BALTIMORE, Dec. 5. Mrs. Clara
Bloodgood, the actress, committed suicide
by shooting In her room at thc Hotel
Stafford here this evening. Mrs. Blood
good's body was found lying on tho bed
with a bullet hole through the roof of her
mouth. Near by lay a book entitled
"How to Shoot Straight," and a 3S
callbor revolver with three chambers
empty. '
She attonded a matinee performance
at Albaugh's theater this afternoon, and
returned to her hotel about 4 o'clock,
soemlngly In tho best of spirits. Later,

Bloodgood was found stretched on tho
bed as described.
Before retiring to her room she had a
talk with her stage manager. John Em
erson, who declares that ho observed
nothing unusual In her demeanor. Tho
only motive he can ascribe Is that Mrs.
Bloodgood feared an attack of nervous
prostration. She had been working very
hard, he said, and she feared a break
down. Mrs. Bloodgood left a note ad
dressed to her husband, who is said to be
on his way to this city.
The audience at the Academy of MU3lc

that there would be no performance to
night owing to a suddon indisposition of

Both Defense and State Protest
Against Night Sessions
if Not Urgent.
BOISE, Idaho, Dec. 5. Thc monoto
nous work of examination of talesmen
in the trial of George A. Pettibone con
tinued today aud tho result of tho day's
work was the exercising of two moro
peremptory challenges by thc state and
one by the defense. Thc state has the
right to uso three more peremptory
challenges arid thc defense four. At
torneys on both sides today complained
io Judge Wood against night sessions,
nnd it was agreed that they should
be discontinued unlcsB it was found
that they were necessary in order to
get a jury this week.
A model juror was found toda" in
Georgo Perkin, a man who said that
he had never read of thc case in the
newspapers and had never discussed it.
Ho had talked to two men about it,
one believing the defendant guilty and
the other believing him innocent. Per
kin is a stock raiser and has no neigh
bors within fourteen miles. Senator
Borah telegraphed J. II. Ilawlcy, chief
counsel for the state, today, that he
would leave Washington for Boise to
night to assist Ln tho prosecution.
Darrow Overruled.
Darrow tried for half an hour to
disqualify Kinkaid, and finally chal
lenged him, but Judge Wood did not
sustain him. Thc defense immediately
oxcuaed him poremptorily. George B.
Eogers came next, but failed to qualify,
and Georgo Perkin was callod. He was
born in England and belonged to the
coal miners rnnion in that country. He
is a farmer and stock raiser now and
his nearest neighbor is fourteen miles
away, bo he has not talked much about
the "cufio and has read little about it.
Only two men over talked to him about
it, and one thought oue way and oi'C
the other. He was accepted by both
sides and thc state used its seventh
peremptory in excusing Charles Yar
rington. Is". E. Jotics'was excused because he
had expressed an unqualified opinion
and E. L. Evans was called to thc jury
box. Ho is working on a farm near
Boise and was formerly in the livery
business here. After careful examina
tion he was passed by both the state
and defense. Judge Wood then ad
journed court until 10 o'clock' tomor

Inability to CoJIect Loans to

KANSAS CITY, Dec. 5. The Na
tional Bank of Commerce of Kansas
City, Mo., ono of tho largest in the
West, with deposits of $16,000,000, 6
closed its doors this moruing and was
taken in charge by a national bank ---
examiner upon an order of the comp-
troller of currency. Later two small HH
outlying banks, in which the Bank of 9l
Commerce was interested, the Stock- 9
yards Bank of Commerce and the
Union Avenue Bauk of Commerce, also
closed.
The failure of these banks had been
predicted for several days, and but lit
tie excitement followed the announce
ment of tho news, although crowds of
depositors gathered about thc doors of
these institutions. The officials of tho
Bank of Commerce, which is affiliated.
with many banks bore and in other ili
parts of the Southwest, express tho :H
opinion that none of them will be seri-
ously affected. Tho failure is laid to i
the withdrawals of outside banks ii
within tho last two months of $1S,- H
000,000 of deposits. They expect to tH
reopen soon, and say depositors will bo H
protected in full.
Other local banks were not seriously l
affected up to noon, and at several H
banks heavy deposits wore made. R
Statement by President. iH
Thc following statement was issued ll
at noon b3' Dr. W. S, Woods, president 1IH
of the National Bank of Commerce, for 1
thc board of directors: fH
"Much as we regret to do so. wo &IH
are compelled to close thc doors of tho fu
National Bank of Commerce, becauso ?!
we have not been able to collect money
from our borrowers as fast as the same MH
was demanded by our depositors, ou ac- fti
count of un.iust and unfounded rumors I
vigorously circulated. li
"During this panic we have reduced !
our deposits from $35,500,000 to about 1
$16,500,000, thus paying out over tho
counter and by transfers to other banks &H
in this citv and other cities about GTH
$18,000,000 of doposits. This of itself K-H
tolls of our resources. Wc havo made H
thc fight of our lives, but could not !
stand tho tide against us. We hope to f
be able to open up thc bank in the
near future for business. Wo don't be-
lieve it possible for a depositor to lose n
a dollar. Wo beg your indulgence and n
forbearanco until our affairs can be ar-
ranged to tho satisfaction of all. Wo
appreciate sensibly tho confidence our fl
numerous customers, largo and small, l
have placed in us. Wc hope to show in K
