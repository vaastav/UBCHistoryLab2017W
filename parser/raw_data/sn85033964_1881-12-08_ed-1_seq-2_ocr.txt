Col. Juo. F. House was elected chair
man ot the democratic house caucus at
Washington Saturday. The caucus re
allirmed the platforms of 1870 and 1S80,
the object being to commit the party to
"a tarifl' (or revenue only." Ihe cau

tariff plank do not consist.

Geu. Cheatham's Defense.
Gen. B. F. Cheatham read a paper be
fore the Kentucky Historical Society
last Thursday night vindicating him
self from the charge made in Gun.
Hood's book that his disobedience of or
ders prevented the capture of the fed
eral army at Spring Hill the day before
the battle ol Frankliu, 29 Xov., 1864.
He establishes conclusively by several
of the officers on the field and from pub
lic records that he was not only not re
sponsible for tbe failure to cut off the
retreat from Spring Hill, but that be
had no orders to do it and Gen. Hood
himself declared the charges baseless.
It seems that the advance Irom Colum
bia was immethodical and bungling
and the different commands were not
manipulated in concert. Gen. Hood ex
pected some of them to take tbe pike
north of the town and intercept the re
treat, perhaps, but he never gave such
orders, but upon the other hand, when
all was in readiness for attack, he or
dered a delay until daylight, and the
yankees slipped out and away over the
unguarded pike. Gen. Cheatham's yer
sion is supported in its various stages
by Jas. D. Porter, his chief of staff,
Ishani G. Harris, Gen. Alex. P. Stewart,
Gen. Lowry, Gen. Bate, Gen. Brown
and even by Gen. Hood himself. It
was a verv serious blunder and it is
probable that one of Gen. Hood's or
ders miscarried and thus bi ought about
a failure that culminated in a terribl
disaster next day at Franklin. Geu
Cheatham needed no vindication to
those who knew hiai, but it is right that
that this statement should go down so
that history may be correct and future
trcnerations mar have no reason to
doubt the fidelity and patriotism of the
old hero. Gen. Brown had a conversa
tion with Gen. Cleburne about three
hours before he was killed and Cle
burne was then wroth and sore under
reported charge from Hood that it was
his nefflect that caused the failure. It
seems, then, that Hood changed his
scape-goat when the doughty Irishman
wa3 killed. Gen. Cheatham does not
seek to cast any odium upon tbe
memory of Gen. Hood, but seems to
recognize tbe peril that surrounds
vindication attempted after his accuser
is dead, and he simply establishes his
own innocence and leaves tbe balance
to silence.
The Banner says it is about time tbe
south was quitting politics and that de
mocracy is a myth and a thing of the
past. For the south to quit politics
would be suicidal, criminal and idiotic
To surrender for all time the control of
the government to a party whoso chief
characteristic is pecculation would be
treasonable. The south is as much in
duty bound to sustain the government
in its. purity as the 'north, and if she
goes out of politics (how foolish it
sounds I) she neglects a stern duty
And the south has a right to contend
for a division of the hundred thousand
federal oflices and the millions of money
that flour out through these channels, as
well as ito seek her proportion of the
millions of appropriations for public en
terprises, and to go out ot politics (how
neffably nonsensical the expression) is
to surender her just property in these
things. Democracy is not the transient
creature of a day, but a principle in free
government, as undying as the mean
ing of liberty, and to desert it is treas
onable and to surrender is cowardice.
The mistakes of leaders does not aflect
the principles of the party, and to quit
it and give up the battle is a miserable
cringing to men and forces that should
be stamped upon instead of yielded to
There may be local matters at times of
more present importance, but the great
undercurrent should be kept in motion
and when occasion requires tbe whole

cardinal elements which a few deser
tions cannot affect.

The President's Message.
President Arthur's messaga sent
in Tuesday is one of ' most elabo
rate documents of its kind on re
cord. He diecusses ably our inter
nal affairs and gives promise oi
thorough reforms. The heft of his
paper is its broad utterances oo
foreign politics, the first real effort
of any American president to claim
first rank for the United States
among the great powers that con
trol in international aflairf. It is
well written, broad, dignified and
able and does credit to our govern
ment. A synopsis here would be
injustice and those who are inter
ested could not rest without a peru
sal in full. The American thus
treats it:
The message of the president is
long, and betokens thorough study
and acquaintance with the rouud
of public duty. It is in all parts
a thorough business paper, dealing
but little in platitudes or 8nti
meDt, driving in a straightforward,
clear manner at tha point. Much
of it 1 devoted to foreign relations,
such as l ave littl.s interest to the
general public. Upon thesa points
he is direct and positive and leaves
no mistaking, ma. meamug.
Chili-I'eruviaa war and subsequent
complications are treated in a man
ner which indicate a determination
to firmly insist upon just dealing
with a conquered foe, so far as that
is in his power. As to the Isthmus
canal he shows a thorough appre
ciation of the dat.ger to be feared
from the proposed European alli
ance with the United States of Co
lumbia. This he intimates a deter
mination to do, if .accessary, all in
his power to thwart. Upon the
kindred subject of the old Clayton
U'jlwer treat, a stupid blunder of
the Taylor administration, he is
equally clear and positive, having
already taken steps to abrogate
such parts as c inflict with the prin
ciples of the treaty of 1846 between
tbe United Stites and Columbia.
For the first time since democracy
went out of power, a decent foreign
policy is promised in such a way
as to :look like business. Afte
twenty vears spent on domestic
questions, at last a president has
uttered words which indicate that
he knows the United Slates are
oart of a trreat world. Ihere are
other matter of importance to geu
eral commerce, but net 6ff,betb
sor bing interest of those referred to.
The Indian policy i& sensibly
treated, and with such practice
and sensible suggestions as can
hardly fail to secure recognition
from congres?.
The civil service is treated for
the first time with a boldness and
directness which do credit to the
business common sense and states
manlike capacity of the president.
He learned tbe necessities of the
service in the cjstoni-house, in
school where its worst evils were
practiced. These Mr. Shcrmau
sa's he would not reform. It mat
ters not that he would not allow
Mr. Sherman to replace his official
army with uis own. lie admtnis
tered the system as it was to sun
himself, and none has ever criticised
his personal honor. 1 his is lrapnr
tant, because is shows that Mr. Ar
thur understands the question and
9 abie to deal with it. But he is
chielly to be commended for per-
ceivmg with a foresight noneot his
predecessors have exhibited, that
this is the question of the hour,
He is in a position to aid in the
movement, and to compel his ad
herents to support it. We hope to
see no wavering on the democratic
3ide because Mr. Arthur has made
the suggestion or because of a
desire to have a deal at it them
selves, some day.

DB. HAWKINS' SPEECH.
He regretted the lateness of the
hour had taken ihe people away.
Giles had a record in the history of
our state as having been honored as no
other county had been in furnishing
three governors. When entering upon
the duties of bis office he looked over
the state in order that he might know
her wants. He remembered that when
he was a boy lands yielded more and he
wondered why it was they had fallen I
away. He inquired into the sj-stems of
cultivation and investigated the chem
ical quality ot our soil ana the philoso
phy of plant growth, and he learned
that certain elements were necessary in
the soil to make it productive. He saw
that in the long years past men were
abstracting these elements and not re
storing them. He related an incident
in Knox where productiveness had de
creased fifty per cent, and perhaps that
ratio prevailed here, and it was nothing

MAJ. SYKES' SPEECH.
lie said he did not come to preach the
gospel of dispair, but prclerred words
of encouragement and hope, and he had
facts which he was anxious for the peo
ple to hoar. On 1st January, 1375, in
tbe midst of darkness and gloom, coon
after the panic of 1873, he had made a
speech in Pulaski which was reported
in lull In Thk Citizen in which he did
all he could to encourage the people,
lie told us then that croakinz and com
plaining made bad matters worse and
that he cannot raise now because
freights eat them up before tlioy can gf t

mate to make it one of the most desira

veloped resources to make it one of the
wealthiest. It is a mistake to say lands

The panic and the cry of hard times and
the discouragement and dispair preached
by so many had produced disastrous re
sults. So it might be again if we heed
these birds of evil omen who by their
hideous and mournful cries alarm and
distress those who listen to them. Ten
nessee is not a pauper state. She is un
derrated by her own people. She is
richer to-day than any southern state,
except it may be Missouri, and she is
little behind her. Emigration is not a
new thing in Tennessee. The western
and southern stites are largely made up
of her sons. They have gone and con
tinue to go under a misapprehension
and undervaluation of our state and its
resources and possibilities. Let the fol

who always prepared their ground well,
planted early and cultivated well, and
never failed! lie mentioned these facts
to show the necessity of immigration as
well aa the folly of emigration. The
more people we have, the higher an av
erage per acre will run. lie then con
trasted Giles and Mairy. Giles was
naturally as rich as Maury, and yet
Giles' lands were assessed at $9.22 and
Maury 's at tUM. Why? Giles pro
duces more cotton, but Maury 600,000
bushels more corn, and this with her
wheat and stock interests made her
lands more valuable, lie read coun
ty after county, showing the rule
was uniform that the more the cot
ton, the lower the land.'. He believed
a sensible, reasonable people loved to be
told the truth. Those who go to other
states from Tennessee will find they
have made a mistake. So. far as manu
facturing facilities and mining wealth
are concerned, she is emphatically a
new state. There may be states where
land sells at lower rates, but when we
consider the improvements on the lands,
the comparative productiveness, the ad
vantages of climate, wealth, good reads
and schools, there is no place where
lands are cheaper iu proportion to their
value. In taxation, Tennessee com
pares favorably with any state In the
Union I lie then detailed tbe plan of
operations and showed that by putting
ourselves in communication with the
Commissioner of Agriculture at Nash
ville and through him with agents in
the north-eastern states, immigration
and capital could be secured. The ob
ject was to organize a county society in
every county in Middle iennessee that
desired one and have them ail act in
harmony. If our streams that go rip
pling towards the sea singing their
songs of uselessness were harnessed into
powei, and if the iron gates ol our
mountains were unlocked, and all kur
resources and wealth utilized, our state
would rapidly take rank with tho first
at the north, as she already heads the
south, and the people that would come
would not only increase our products
but consume those we do not raise now
because of no demand. If the south had
but one-twentieth the um. appropriated
to northern development she would
grow mightily, but our help must come
from our own muscles and brain unaid
ed. This society would brinar our ener
gies together and by united effort we
could induce the railroads to discrimi
nate for us instead of against us. Maj.
