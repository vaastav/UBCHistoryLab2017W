THE CHIEF'S ANNUAL REPORT
THE TIME LIMIT FI3ESD IN THE
HITCHING ORDINANCE
Status of the Litigation to Which the
City Is a Party—Attorney Dunn's
Report—City Hall Notes
,9 system of nnes Is to be adopted by
the fire department to be Imposed upon
all callmen and other members who fall
to respond to alarms, and special priv
ileges that have been heretofore grant
ed certain of the callmen as to the man
ner In which they reported are to be re
voked. This action was decided upon
at the regular meeting of the board of
Are commissioners yesterday morning.
What the amount of the fines will be
has not been decided upon, but for each
alarm to which the callmen fail to re
spond a certain amount of their pay will
be withheld, and If they miss more than
three during the month they will have
to explain the matter to the satisfaction
of the board or lose their positions.
The first steps towards instituting civil
service rules in the entire department
were taken nnd an amendment to the
rules was presented providing for the
adoption of this system. No final action
was taken, however, it being desired
that the members ascertain the best
method of securing the change.
DELINQUENTS ESCAPE
The matter of imposing fines came up
in connection wl*h the examination by
the board into the fact that Callman
Shearer had been drawing two salaries
from the city. The beard could take no
action in regard to this matter, but it
had been discovered from the reports of
the captains that the callman had miss
ed five alarms during November. He
was therefore called before the commis
sion to explain. He stated that four of
the reported absences were errors and
called the chief to witness that he had
beeh at most of the fires that he had
been reported to have missed. He was
working for tho city tax collector, and
after each fire would return to the city
hall Instead of going to his engine house
and reporting for roll call as the rules
provide. His explanation was accepted
and he was excused.
A number of misses by Callman Gar
diner were also brought to the atten
tion of the board, and Chief Moore
stated that he had received satisfactory
excuses from the delinquent. The rules
require that all callmen shall appear
at the engine house after each alarm
and answer to roll call. If they fall to
respond they are reported absent. Some
Of them have special arrangements by
which they report by telephone, and if
the fire Is not in the district covered
by their engine company they do not go
to the engine house. The chief was
Ordered to enforce the rule requiring
the presence of callmen at the engine
houses and to report all absntees. Mr.
Wells stated that he believed the plan
Of having callmen was not a good one,
and that a full paid department could
be secured without additional cost If the
proper steps were taken.
CIVIL SERVICE RULES
Commissioner Wells submitted the fol
lowing amendment to rule 3 of the fire
department, and requested that action
be deferred upon it until the next regu
lar meeting of the board:
As an Incentive to good service ana dis
cipline and as an Important factor In In
creasing the efficiency of the fire depart
ment through the selection and retention
Of those best qualified to fill the positions,
all callmen and others new to the service
Shall be selected by competitive tests as to
fitness, physically, Intellectually and mor
ally, under the regulations adopted by the
board of fire commissioners. All promo
tions shall be made in order from the next
lower grade or grades of the existing force,
based on competitive tests showing ef
ficiency, personal character and ability
and knowledge in the line of duty, and no
removal shall be mada except for cause,
on written charges preferred to and sus
tained by the board.
Mr. Wells also presented the follow
ing resolution, action on which was also
deferred at his request until the next
meeting:
Resolved. That all purchases in the open
market, whenever practicable, be male
after prices have been named In writing
by two or more responsible persons or
firms; that supplies be purchased and kept
In store In quantities that will warrant the
observance of the foregoing method, and
that any person or iirm shall lie allowed
to bid who has filed in the office of the
fire department a request to be considered
in the next succeeding purchase.
ANNUAL REPORT
Chief Moore's annual report, which
was filed during the session, was ono of
the most voluminous that he has ever
made. It was in manuscript, he having
not had time to have it published before
submitting it to the commission. The
papers were not closely examined, as
most of the commissioners are familiar
with the contents. The chief was In
structed to have it printed in the usual
form and then submit It to the city coun
cil. By resolution the commission ap
proved the report.
There are some Interesting figures In
this statement of the doings of the fire
department for one year. The total num
ber of alarms to which the fire depart
ment responded Is 211, of which 31 were
false alarms. There were 210 actual
fires at which loss was Incurred, the
number for each month being as follows:

Of the total number of fires eleven
were caused by defective flues, 3 by the
explosion ot gas or distillate, 31 by the
explosion of gasoline stoves, 9 by coal
oil stove explosions, 9 were grass and
brush fires, children playing with
matches were responsible for 6 fires, 4
were known to have been of Incendiary
origin and 4 supposed to be so; those
from unknown causes numbered 3D.
The total or partial destruction of
barns or stables caused IS alarms;
dwelling house fires, 77; sheds, out
houses, etc., 17; lodging houses, 10; the
burning of oil wells, 7.
There were but two second alarms
sounded during the year. One of these
was for the fire In the Burbank theater
and the other for an oil well blaze. In
point of loss the most serious fire dur
ing the time covered by the report was
the partial destruction of Sherwood
Dunn's residence on Adams street, at
which the loss was $30,000. As the de
partment has no means of ascertaining
the Insurance on buildings burned no
record of Insurance Is kept.
SOME RECOMMENDATIONS
Under the caption "Civil Service"
Chief Moore's report says:
The commissioners nnd officers desire
to place the fire department on the high
est possible plane of efficiency and at
the lowest practical cost, for on the
equation between efficiency and cost
depends largely that saving from loss
by fire to effect which the fire depart
ment Is called into being. This high
grade of efficiency cannot be attained
under the call system, and even with a
full paid fire department, which has been
shown to be within reach and without
increasing Its cost, the best results will
await better methods than now prevail
in making appointments and promo
tions. These better methods may be
summed up as:
(a.) All appointments should be made
on merit after competitive tests open
to all of physical, intellectual and moral
fitness.
(b.) All positions from the chief down
should be permanent, removable even by
the commission only for sufficient cause,
and placed beyond the reach of friends
or foes, bo they high or humble.
(c.) All promotions should be made,
when possible, from within the existing
force and should be based on tested
efficiency, personal character and de
veloped ability in line of duty.
The foregoing requirements, viz: ap
pointments on merit, permanence of ser
vice and promotions in order of excel
lence, constitute the essential features
of the reform known as civil service.
As to the manner of purchasing and
keeping supplies, the report says: "A
necessity has been felt for a more thor
ough system of accounts to show both In
detail and comprehensively all stores
purchased by the department. To meet
this need forme of property returns hove
been prepared which will exhibit at the
close of each month the amount of each
article purchased and Issued during the
month and the amount of each remain
ing on hand at the close of the month.
ROUTINE BUSINESS
Driver Burch of engine No. 3 was be
fore the board to explain how he had
happened to let his horses get away from
him at a fire. He stated that he and the
engineer were the only persons on the
engine and upon reaching the hydrant
he had held his horses with one hand,
and after uncoupling the pole from the
engine had tried to assist the engineer
in attaching the suction pipe to the
hydrant. In turning the water on there
was a sudden spurt and a hiss from a
leak in the hydrant, which frightened
the horses. Before he could control
them they jerked the reins out of bis
hand and ran away. He was held
blameless for the runaway.
The petition of W. M. Lees for permis
sion to operate a blacksmith shop at 136
South Los Angeles street was denied.
Several of the persons who had signed
the petition also signed a protest against
the establishment of such a shop there.
The Los Angeles Fertilizer company
was granted permission to operate a
steam boiler and engine at the Ninth
street dump.
Chief Moore reported that during tho
past week there had been eight alarms
of fire.
In regard to the matter of the com -
munication of L. F. Alvarez, in which
he stated that he had been assaulted by
F. Leavl of the No. 1 engine company,
Chief Moore reported that he had in
vestigated the matter and had repri
manded the fireman and that Alvarez
was satisfied to let the matter drop.
TIME LIMIT FIXED
Hitching to Be Allowed for Twenty
Minutes at a Stretch
At a special session of the city council
yesterday morning the antl-hltchlng or
dinance, alhjut the modification of which
there has been so much wrangling
among merchants and eouncllmen for
several weeks, was amended so as to
allow hitching on the streets for a period
not to exceed twenty minutes at a time.
The change was made by the unanimous
vote of the council, and the assurance
has been given that the police depart
ment will make every effort to enforce
the new measure when It goes Into effect.
The session of the council was brief,
not more than fifteen minutes being
consumed in deciding the matter. Be
fore the session was called to order then
was much lobbying on the measure and a
great deal of private discussion between
the members in the committee loom.
The matter was in the hands of the
board of public works, and that body met
Just before the hour for the sperlal
meeting and agreed upon a report, which
they made later.
"When the council met, Judge Wright,
who has represented tho Merchants and
Manufacturers' association in the mat
ter throughout the time it had been un
der discussion, stated that any change
that might be made in the ordinance
would not be met with opposition from
that association. It had not been the
Intention of those who favored the ordi
nance to cause it to work a hardship
upon any persons. In its present form it
undoubtedly did this, and in the light
of the objections that had been made
the association did not feel Justified In
Insisting upon tho maintenance of the
present ordinance.
Councilman Toll also favored a
change. Ho stated that ho had been In
formed that Chief of Police Glass had
said that the new measure could and
would be enforced. The board of pub
lic works submitted the following ordi
nance which was ut once adopted, after
which the council adjourned:
The mayor und council of the city of
Los Angeles do ordain as follows:

SAM'S PROCLAMATION
PORT-AU-PRINCE. Dec. B.—(By As
sociated Press.) Count Schwerln, Ger
man charge d'affaires, was reclved by
the president this afternoon. The public
mind continues agitated and all the
regulars and national guadr are In read
iness. Shortly before 2 o'clock the pres
ident Issued a proclamation to the peo
ple of Hayti, saying that for the second
time Hayti had yielded to German force,
contrary to Its rights. The government,
according to the proclamation, ahd de
cided to resist even to the last, but ow
ing to the lack of promised moral Influ
ence, the character of which Is not In
dicated In . the proclamation, It was
obliged to accept the ultimatum. The
proclamation Invites the Hayti people to
cease international quarreling and to
labor for the raising up again of the
nation.
TROUBLE FEARED
PORT-AU-PRINCE, Dec. B.—M. Fred
erlque, managing editor of the Journal
Impartial, the alleged author of the vio
lent articles attacking the Germans,
who Is accused of desiring to excite the
populace of this place against the gov
ernment, was arrested today and taken
on board a Haytian cruiser. At the mo
ment of his embarkation, there was

position a sufficient number of troops,
and is taking all the necessary meas
ures to maintain order.
THE OFFICIAL ACCOUNT

alleged illegal arrest of Herr Emil Luo
ders, says that after the ultimatum of
Germany had been delivered to the Hay
tian government, the German cruiser
Stein cleared for action, and took up a

Germany were conceded and the sum of
$30,000 Insisted upon as Indemnity to be
paid to Herr Lueders, was on board the

LONDON BANKERS
Express Disappointment Over tbe
McKinley Message
NEW YORK, Dec. B.—A dispatch to
the World from London says: Lord Rev
elstoke, head of the banking firm of Rar
ing Bros., was asked today for his opin
ion on the effect of President McKinley's
message. Lord Revelstoke said:
"The currency suggestions have been
decidedly disappointing. We expected
something more tangible than a scheme
contingent upon conditions which the
President gives no Indication Of any In
tention to bring about" . , ._
"Do you consider the pacific tone of
the message calculated to Improve the
market for American securities over
here?" he was asked.
"Yes," replied Lord Revelstoke, "It Is
certainly a relief to find nothing agress
lve in the message. I anticipated that
business with the United States will be
very brisk after the new year. They are
having prosperous times over there and
confidence Is being gradually restored."
Mr. Gordon, who succeeded the late
Walter Burns In the direction of the
London branch of J. P. Morgan & Co.,
said: "Several stock exchange men who
have been in here this morning tell me
there is general disappointment at the
wishy-washy color of the President'",
currency paragraph and American stocks
are weaker in sympathy with that feel
ing."
H. J. McNeill, Secretary of the Blmet
tallic League, said: "Blmetalllsts re
gard the President's reference to tha
Wolcott mission with considerable satis
faction. We did not consider the reply
of the British government as in any way
finally closing negotiations. The fact
that the Wolcott commission has not
yet reported, together with the Pres
ident's expressions, encourages the hope
that the United States and the French
government contemplate further action
early."
CHARGED WITH PERJURY
Filed on a Mine as a Timber Claim In
Butte County
SAN FRANCISCO, Dec. B.—Lincoln
Brodt of Butte county Is on trial for
perjury in the United States district
court. The perjury of which he is ac
cused Is alleged to have been committed
in filing claims for the land on which the
Alkl mine Is located before the register
of the land office at Marysville. In mak
ing his filings he swore that the land
was chiefly valuable for the timber on it
The facts as alleged by the government
are that the Alkl mine has been contin
uously worked for eight or nine years,
and that there are $20,000 worth of im
provements on the property to plain
view, and that the noise of blasting and
other mining operations could be heard
for a great distance.
Brodt secured a patent from the land
office on his filings without the knowl
edge of Parry and Mery, the owners of
the Alkl mine. As soon as they learned
of this they brought suit to annul the
patent, which was done, and the com
missioners of the land office instructed
the United States attorney for this dis
trict to bring the matter to the atten
tion of the grand Jury. This was done
and Indictment found. Brodt's defense
is that he thought the mine was on an
adjoining section of land.
Jamestown Water Supply
JAMESTOWN, Dec. B.—The Tuolumne
County Water company's flume, which
has been shut down for about two and
a half months, was opened today and
water reached this city this evening.

months many of the mills have been
shut down but they will resume work at
once. The dam has been reconstructed
.and the company will be In a position
In .the future to furnish an abundance
of water.
NOT YET AFLOAT
the German Bark Fotrimpos Vails to
Oome Off
ASTORIA, Ore., Deo. «.—For six
jionths the Foard A Stokes company of
jpiis city, purchasers of the German bark
'otrlmpos, whloh went ashore on North
beach Dec. 19, 1898, has been laying its
plans and making strenuous efforts to
float the vessel. Expert wreckers were
engaged, four or Aye pumping engines,
steam winches and other valuable ma
chinery were placed upon her and a few
days ago Mr. Lawrence Foard of San
Francisco arrived on the scene and took
charge of the operations. A short time
ago every preparation was made to float
the ship at the present high tide, but to
day disaster unexpectedly overtook their
efforts.
A special dispatch from the scene of
the wreck to the Astorlan says: The
bark Fotrimpos capsized on her beam
end at 9:45 this morning. She has been
afloat for the past two days. Yesterday
she moved about 250 feet further north
on the beach. About 9:30 this morning
she carried away the port chock, tear
ing up the bulwarks and throwing the
strain well abeam of the ship. This
prevented the men In charge from keep
ing her to the sea and there being no
bnllast aboard at 9:45 she turned on her
beam ends toward the sea so that her
spars struck tbe sand. At the time of
the accident there were fourteen men
aboard Including Mr. Foard and Capt.
Driko, but all reached the shore safely
by means of shore lines attached to the
ship. Engineer James Carroll had a
narrow escape. Both life saving crews
from Fort Canby and Long Beach ar
rived here shortly after the men got
ashore.
The ship lies about 65 feet from the
drift logs and pretty well sanded, but
Mr. Foard has hopes of saving her.

A Noted Composer's Start
Herve, the French composer, began his
musical career as an organist. When a
boy he strolled Into church one day and
persuaded the blower to allow him to

In Justice Owens' court, charging Nich
olson with obtaining $20 by means of a
worthless check. The draft was drawn
on the Exchange bank of Santa Ana
and was given on the 18th of October.
Crank was slightly acquainted with

as a favor. This was about the same

worthless checks on Jerry Illlch.
The warrant was placed tn the hands
of Deputy Constable Tom Qulnn, who
served It upon Nicholson In the county
Jail. Nicholson remarked that he wasn't
responsible for his acts at the time, as he
had been on a protracted spree and had
no recollection Of his transactions.
WOULDN'T BELIEVE A CHINESE
Not Even If Be Should Swear That He
Was Guilty
Emlle G. Landsberg hates a Chinese.
He does not often neglect an oppor
tunity to tell how much he despises the
race. In his work as a cement con
tractor Mr. Landsberg has had a great
deal to do with Mongolians and claims
to know much of their character.
Testerday he was summoned as a
juror in the lottery case against Hen
Yee, tried In Justice Morrison's court.
He was asked the usual questions before
being accepted by the Chinaman's coun
sel. The query was put "would you
believe a Chinaman under oath as read
ily as a white man?"
"No, sir, I would not," shouted Mr.
Landsberg In reply. "I know too much
about them and would not believe one
of them under any circumstances. Why,
sir, I would not believe that ChirTaman
under oath if he should swear that he
was guilty."
Mr. Landsberg was not required to sit
on the Jury.
