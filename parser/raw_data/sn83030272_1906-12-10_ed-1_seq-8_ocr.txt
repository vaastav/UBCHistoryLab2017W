mentary form in various newspapers allover
over tho country having reached thepress
press from some source to us unknownbut
but not as we are informed from MrSTORFR
STORFR or by any agency of hisWe
We think it proper then that it shouldbe
be published in full and give it aswe
we say with unwillingness because weBincerely
sincerely deprecate a publication whichreflects
reflects so seriously upon the Presidentof
of the United States Wo prefer for thepresent
present at least to leave the whole subject
ject to the judgment of our readers believing
lieving that it is on respecting whichthey
they are abundantly able to conceive andexpress
express an adequate and just opinionJapan
Japan Real ObjectiveThe
The telegrams from Tokio show howquickly
quickly and thoroughly the Japanesehave
have appreciated the friendly referenceto
to them in the Presidents messageReflection
Reflection has convinced them that MrROOSEVELT
ROOSEVELT did but expresa a sympathyof
of which Americans have given repeatednnd
nnd striking proofs To say nothingof
of the important part played by ourcountrymen
countrymen in Japans great awakening
ing which began nearly forty years agowe
we showed our good will by returningto
to her a pecuniary Indemnity on tground eground
ground that it was excessive and unjustand
and we helped her to secure release fromthe
the humiliating r gime of exterritoriality
ity During that war in the Far Eastwhich
which is generally recognized as thocrisis
crisis in the history of the Japanesemost
mOt of our influential newspapers werearrayed
arrayed upon their side and the resultwas
was the creation of a popular sentimenton
1 on this side of the Atlantic which ultimately
c mately took the substantial form of subscriptions
scriptions to a Japanese foreign loa
In view of such evidences of our goo
will the Japanese people might well hesitate
tate to quarrel with the United Stateseven
even if events had condemned them t
the role of an island empireThat
That is the rbiI to which Japan musthave
have been relegated had she been beatenby
by Russia in Manchuria In that eventher
her expansive energies must necessarilyhave
have sought an outlet first in the Phi
ippines as lying nearest to her handand
and ultimately in other islands of theMalay
Malay archipelago such as Borneo andCelebes
Celebes In the end she would havowished
wished to absorb Sumatra Java andNew
f New Guinea That is to say of the tworacial
I racial elements which enter into thoJapanese
Japanese stockthe Mongolian and thealayantho
Malayan tho latter would have becomepreponderant
preponderant In l word Japan whileremaining
i remaining an insular would have become
t come 1 great Malayan Power such aswe
J we can see from tho ruins of huge temples
i pIes existed in Java many centuriesbeore
1 beore that island became known toropeans
Flfopean ropeans That we repeat is thefuture
future to which Japanese aspirationswould
ij would have definitely turned had thehope
hope of gaining a foothold on the Asiaticmainland
mainland been quenched by RussiaAs
As things are now well informed andintelligent
4 intelligent Japanese can have no desireto
to relieve us of the di flitalt task of maintaining
taming tranquillity and order in thePhilippines
Philippines for they are finding thopacification
c pacification of the interior of FormosaBufllciently
sufficiently irksome and costly Witha
a much smaller expenditure of bloodand
i and money they can look forward to thocomplete
complete assimilation of Corea nnd tothe
the gradual acquisition of ascendencyover
over the unwarlike Chinese throughoutManchuria
Manchuria from the Amur River to thoGreat
Great Wail In that region they wouldencounter
encounter conditions of soil nnd climatewith
with which they are familiar and inwhich
which they would thrive Once firmlyplanted
planted in Manchuria they would be ina
a position to form extremely intimateand
and mutually profitable relations withChina

limit to the western horizon of Japansaggrandizement

Since however the citadel of JapansAsiatic
Asiatic empire would for many decadesIf
If not centuries continue to bo its groupof
of Islands it is obvious that a commandof
of the sea would h indispensable Forthat
that reason as her Elder Statesmen aropretty
pretty sure t see and to point out Japancannot
cannot afford togo t war with either ofthe
the two maritime nations Great Britainand
and the United States which by virtueof Iof
of their geographical situation and oftheir
their inexhaustible pecuniary resourceswould
would b certain to triumph in the endwhatever
whatever temporary success might conceivably I
ceivably be gained by the JapaneseIn
In the long run either the British or theAmerican
American navy would manage to drivethe
the Mikados war vessels from the oceanand
t and thenceforth tho Japanese wouldfind
t find themselves cut off from their hard II
I

won possessions on the Asiatic continent
nent They would have no such resultto
to dread from a contest with Germanyor
or with Franco and they do not expecta
a Russian fleet t face them again in thePacific

From another point of view far sight

however that our country Is destinedto

The Limit of Safe ProsperityReplying
Replying to I question regarding theprobable
probable results of the present sessionof
of Congress 0 distinguished Senatorsaid
said that he hoped that nothing wouldbe
be done which would tend to increaseour
our national prosperity The statement
ment is a little startling until it in care
fully digestedIt
I is a question whether this countryis
is not today very much like a youngsterwho
who has eaten more jam than is at nilgood Igood
good for him and yet is hungry for moreNothing
Nothing is of real value unless it can beproperly iproperly
properly utilized and controlled TheUnited
United States may be said to be crippledby I
by its present prosperity We have notlaborers
laborers enough to do our work we havenot
not cars enough t move our crops andour
our merchandise and there is even ashortage
shortage of money for the proper conduct
duct of business It is true that thereare
are many who have less than they wantand
and some who have less than they needThat
That is inevitable under any circumstances
stances But never before in the history
tory of this country and perhaps neverin
in the history of any other country havethe
the comforts the conveniences andeven
even the luxuries of life been so widelydistributed
distribute they are among the American
can people todayIn
In 1870 a single generation ago thetotal
total wealth of the United States as represented
resented by the aggregate value of allreal
real and personal property was officially
cially reported as 30068518000 Thetotal
total for the present year is officiallyestimated
estimated as a little exceeding 100000
000000 The population of the countryin
in 1870 was 38558311 I is now approximately
proximately 85000000 Within that generation
eration wealth has travelled at a muchswifter
swifter pace than has population Withinsix
six years the value of our agriculturalproducts
products has increased from 3704177706to
to very nearly 0800000000 accordingto
to the figures of Secretary WILSONWithin
Within five years the value of our manufactured
factured products according to figuresgiven
given by the Census Bureau has risenfrom
from about 13000000000 for the year

The condition of the country is ama
ing Our 30000000 people actually engaged
gaged in gainful occupations are unableto
to do all the work there Is to h doneWe
We need both skilled and unskilled workmen

3000000 freight cars is inadequate forthe
the transportation of our merchandiseNearly
Nearly 3000000000 of money in actualcirculation

Not Altogether a Little CommitteeWho
Who are we says the lon FREDERICK
ERICK H GILLETT of MassachusettsWho
Who are we a little connnittco of Congress
gross to stand in the way of a grandwork
work of reform inaugurated by so greata
a man as the President of the UnitedStates
States Of course nobody ventured areply
reply to an interrogatory so pverwheliningly
ingly delivered As everybody knowsthe
the House Committee on Appropriationsis
is now ono of the many insignificantbodies
bodies connected with our modem schemeof
of government It is still useful aspart
part of the make believe of constitutional
Even the wisestand

and most inspired system of paternalismneeds
needs a certain machinery for the formulation

But Mr GILIKTT ifl wholly right in assuming
suming that the committees of Congresshave
have no longer any proper functionsave
save that of registering the decisions andrubberstamping
rubberstamping the proclamations ofthe

The fact that the rest of the littlecommittee

agreed with Mr GILLETT and finallydecided
decided with practical unanimity againstthe
the employment of the reformed spellingin
in documents turned out by tho PublicPrinting

TAWNKY identified certain members oftho
tho simplified spoiling board as prominent

you are liable to err and you do I when you giveso

may say tn the councils of the guild and I voicethe
the sentiment of my class when I say that most Ifnot
not all hotel men ore mvan of spirit and smallhalured

And now theyve ratted the rates all around tooI
I dont know why Salaries of travelling men areas
as low as ever and despite all the alleged prosperity
