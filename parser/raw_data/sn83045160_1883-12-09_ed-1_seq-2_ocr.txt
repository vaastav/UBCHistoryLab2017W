A TOTTERISG TERRITOBT.
The Mormons are mad, tearing, raging,
wind-tossed, Ka-billows-rolling mad. That
the proposition to repeal the actcreating
Utah into a Territory should be recom
mended in a President's message excited
their ire to the utmost. The polygamistic
crew enjsy the places and form the repre
sentatives of that Territory, elected by the
votes of the half-dozen wives and ten to
fifteen grown up daughters of each of
their families. To take from them the
power of appointing officers and making
laws for the Territory is-' a prospect that
makes them foam and froth with indigna
tion and livid with wrath. They see in
the President's message what the guilty
king saw when the fearful mene, mene, tekel,
upharins met his horror-stricken eyes. The
boasting, bullying, overbearing, wily
priests are loud in denunciations,
railing down heaven's anger with
the zeal of thfi middle ages
and the malice of the inquisition.
Their tithes are in danger, their day of
power is threatened with a sudden sunset.
They and their leaders have lorded over
the Territory with a high hand ; they have
gathered riches and grasped power, but
. when the Territorial government no longer
exists they are shorn of the locks that gave
them strength. They cannot even have
Sampson's consolation of pulling down
the pillars and destroying his enemies; it
is the enemy that pulls down and them
selves who are destroyed.
WDXAX SCrrSAUE DEJTOl'SCKD.
One of the commonest fallacies in the
world is the mistake, when two events
happen about the name time, to imagine
that one of them is connected with, or
even the cause of the other. A man has
an accident and breaks his leg, he remem
bers that that very morning he accidentally
put the boot belonging on the other leg on
the very leg that is broken. He sees it all
now, and can trace one event from the
Jjtlier. A specimen of this mode of argu
nt has recently appeared in connection
-TTith the woman sulfrago question. In
JPJyoming Territory the Legislature has
Conferred the suffrage upon women. In
fivfyoming, as unfortunately elsewhere,
there is corruption, abuse of power, and
unhappy social evils. Some of the oppo
nents of woman suffrage, like the
man with the broken leg, can clear
ly trace out what is the matter. There
is corruption in Wyoming, and there is
woman suffrage in Wvouiing. Therefore
woman sufTrnj!e ismischievious and use
less and ou'ht to be abolished. Woninn
HulTrii;;; has not prevented corruption nor
reformed politics, therefore woman should
not be allowed to vote. It is agreed by
common consent that what is sauce for the
goose is an uce for the gander; let us see
how the sauce acts in the easo before us.
Men are allowed to vote in Wyoming,
there Is corruption, abuse of power and
social evil there, therefore men ought not
' to vote the gander can cackle and go
about his business, he has got his sauce.
TAKII'F UKFOR.If.
That a reduction will be made in the
tariir and the sham revision set aside is
now a settled conclusion. The will of the
people is so plain upon tin's point that the
protectionists themselves are acknowledg
ing the fact and are preparing for it. In
stead of bawling for "more, more," as they
did when the sham revision was created,
they have so far changed their tactics as to
tie willing to sacrifice one or two articles
enjoying protection to save the rest. Of
those, sugar is the principal one. The
proportion of sugar grown in Louisiana is
ho small that to put a duty of two anil one
half cents on tho vast amount imported in
support of the Louisiana crop is felt, even
by the wiser protectionists themselves, to
be too great an infliction upon the patience
and the pockets of a peoplo who desire to
have "a free breakfast table." The Louisiana-
papers protest strongly against
their sugar being made into a
tub to throw to the whale. The New
Orleans journals claim that the duty upon
sugar is not a protective, but a mere
revenue tariff. Very well, if such be the
case, as the revenue is too large, sugar is
one of the best things that can be lowered,
so that the poor fumily may have their
coffee as sweet as it wishes it. Besides,
sugar is a kind of raw material ; it comes
here from the West Indies in a rough
xtate, and is refined by American labor.
Wool, another raw material, iron and
steel and silk and cotton goods, are a'eo
spoken of as requiring reduction, to which
ship-building materiid should be added. A
number of articles, especially of the kind
that is manufactured here, although the
material comes from abroad, are likely to
Ikj put upon tho free list. Kcgulation is
also required where articles are partially
manufactured in this country. For in
stance, many articles of ladies' ready
made wear are imporicd, because to
import tho parts of which they aro
made and givo the making to Ameri
can workwomen would cause tho finished
articlo to cost more than it can bo
imported for, which is a clear instance of
the way the protection of American labor
fails to protect. When tho necessary
changes are made, and we have a real, not
a sham tariff revision, our working people
will find their wages will purchase more
necessaries than they do now, which will
bo a step toward a real, not a sham pro
tection of American labor. The monopo
ists wince and whino under the prospoct
of their losing tho heavy share of public
contributions with which they have been
building up their fortunes, but their out
cries aro tlm very Htrong38t proof that
.could bo given that tde progress toward
tariff reform is progress in tho right direc
tion, for tho interest of the monopolist is
opposed to that of the peoplo. Tariff re
form is a step in the direction of that
happy consummation when every Amer
ican citizen can exercise his right to buy
. where he can buy cheapest and soli where
ho can sell dearest.
A NOCIAL OI TRAOE.
A directory of American heiresses has
been published in London for tho uso of
the aristocratic dudes in search of rich
wives. This directory gives the name,
ugo and address of every young unmarried
lady in the United States to whom a for
tune has deceded. The salo of this book
has been so great that it is said the direc
tory will be issued every vcar with nil the
necessary erasures and additions. This is
certainly a great social outrage an insult
to the young ladies of America. It should
make them exceedingly cautious and cir
cumspect in receiving the attentions of
foreign adventurers. But, strange to say,
tho conduct of the American heiresses
has invited tho publication of this direc
tory, for nearly all of them visit Kurope
annually in the hope of marry
ing into "good society," and their
parents or guardians are aiders and
abetters in this humiliating business.
Whenever an American girl arrives at a
Ixuulon hotel the aristocratic scions rush
to tho directory, and if her name does not
appear as an heiress she is neglected. But
if a dollar mark and half a dozen num
erals nppcar opposite her name the snobs
seek an introduction and a fortune. When
a marriage grows out of such transactions
it is hard to tell which gets the worst of
the bargain the snob who sella himself
or the girl who buys him. The English
press excuse this breach of national cour
tesy by the publication of this directory
upon the ground that the heiresses of
America prefer English society and En.
giish husbands to American society and
American husbands, and therefore con
tribute to tho publication of a book which
facilitates their aspirations. If this
be true what a shameful cotnmen
. tary on American jiride. The Amer
ican women look to Europe for
their fashions and now they look
to the same source for their husbandp.
.This sort of vassalage is the worst curse
that can befall a nation, because comes
with Mfthe debased feeling of inferiority,
imitative subserviency and generates a
spirit of submissive littleness. With all
their boasting the people of the United
States do not possess that self-consciousness
which is the only solid basis of na
tional pride. They rail at kings, yet toady
to royalty. They denounce aristocracy,
yet in every city, town, village and
neighborhood, however insignificant, may
be seen a little knot of purse-proud
numbskulls aping all its fopperies, as
suming all its petty airs, and looking
down on the honest, . toiling masses
with all the dignified hatred with which
the poodle riding in the lap of the par
venue looks down upon the unfortunate
cur trudging through the mud and mire.
In short, we abuse other countries and
Imitate them in almost everything. This
is not national pride, but national non
sense, folly and littlenexs. We assume a
superiority, yet acknowledge our inferi
ority by imitation.
ONLY THE GRAVE ABE GREAT.
No amount of warning, or teaching or
ridicule will ever disturb the popular
belief that reserve and a grave, melan
choly demeanor covers something deep,
profound and powerfuL He who makes
a jest of life will never achieve greatness.
The stupid ass of antiquity, who sever
laughed and gloried in the name of the
"Weeping Philosopher," was considered
greater than the "Laughing Philosopher,"
who ridiculed the follies and sorrows of
men. The ability and piety of a minister
is judged by his awful solemnity. If he
"sucks melancholy as a weasel sucks
blood" he is pronounced great. Levity in
the pulpit makes the minister a hypocrite
and the flippant popinjay. It is so in all
the relations of life, and has been recently
most forcibly illustrated in the candi
dacy of the Hon. S. S. Cox for the
Speakership. Intellectually Mr. Cox has
no superior in Congress. His mind
is as bright as a sunbeam, clear and spark
ling. His scholarly attainments are great
and his reading embraces the history of
the world. When the occasion requires it
he can discuss questions with the serious
ness and ability of the philospher and
statesman. But the world will not permit
him to be great, because he does not con
tract his features into a frown, laughs him
self and makes other people laugh. In
discussing the dangers of humor, tho New
York World says
There is no reason why Mr. Cox should not
have enjoyed trio nonor. Ho has earned ll by
fidelity In principle, by earnest work for the party
and by his sterling hunesly in public life, lie
has lived tbruugh an unprecedented era of cor
ruption, and his record it) without a slain, lint
somehow people rehired to regard Mr. Cox as so-
nou.Hly a candidate, and this injured bis canvas.
iiio misfortune of a humorist s reputation was
sullK'ient. to destroy the claims iM-ining from his
real qutilificiLtion for the position and from party
service. Mr. Cox has scholarly attainments, liu
is an author, a journalist, a philosopher, a man of
travel, a legislator ot experience, for twenty
five years he bas faithfully served the peoplo
Hut because be is a humorist, fond of his joke
always ready with his pun, his sarcasm or his
repnrtce. ho has been defeated for the J5eaker
ship. This is not strnnge. Vet people do not
want solemn looks and serious words ail the
time. A little relaxation does us Rood. V
can appreciate the church on Sunday although we
do po to comic opera on fviturduy micht and
to
negro melodist performance on Monday.
Still.
is iinuuestionably true that history is full of Uie
examples of ablo men who have been destroyed
by humor. Somehow people expect those who
occupy grave positions to be grave themselves.
"Wllti drives fat cnttlo should himself be fat."
Mr. Corwin had plenty of ability, but he felt the
uniwuaca til ills cuaracier us a uumorisfc M
seriously that he gave this advice to young men
"liou't ever try to be funny!'
Humor has ever been fatal to greatness
and it ever will be. Julius Oesar appre
ciated a joke as an enormity, and if he had
been funny, genial and pliant he would
nevor have achieved greatness.- Wash
ington had no great learning or acquire
ments. He made no pretensions to schol
arship and had no opportunities for ex
tensive reading. He could not speak and
never mingled in stormy debate. He had
no personal fascinations, no gracious, win
ning affability which attracts men. But
he had an august presence which inspired
moro of we than affection, and the
majesty of his demeanor had much to do
with his greatness. Grant is another il-
lustration of what silence and stately
dignity will do for a man of ordinary
ability. And we are not alone in this
delusion. In other lands and other forms
of government the same confidence In
owlish silence opens tho way to succes. In
fact, in this and other countries a brusque,
solemn manner, amounting almost to
vulgarity and rudeness, makes men
awfully great. The late Napoleon was
an exceedingly stupid man. But to
name that shone out from the smoke of a
hundred lights, each one almost altering
the geographical outlines of Europe,' he
added the talents of solemn looks and
mysterious silence made conspicuous by
a sullen and brutal manner. This ass of a
world took his power for granted until
ono day at Gravelotte a bayonet pricked
the idol, the bran ran out, and the solemn
effigy collapsed. His grave looks im
pressed his soldiers and his countrymen
that there was something hidden in his
bosom which he could not impart to his
countrymen. But this solemnity was
nothing but the silence of the contempt
ible swashbuckler, for in the midst of the
battlo he rushed to the telegraph and dis
patched to the Empress that their son had
been baptized in batt'e and wasn't scared,
and in a few short hours he and the boy
were prisoners. This long-bodied and short-
legged fool maintained his greatness, as
thousands of others have done, by looking
wise and solemn. In England the most
ordinary men achieve greatness by living
the life of a recluse, keeping their most
influential supporters in the aristocracy at
arm's length, and ruling their ministers as
a merchant rules his countinghquse. Dis
raeli, in his official grandeur, treated his
Cabinet with a reserve approaching hau
tear, and was least considerate of those
who supposed themselves to have done
him the greatest political services. These
facts aro well calculated to induce the am
bitious young man to grow cynical, to cul
tivato the habit, of sitenco and Bolutmvittf,
and to regard fun and humor as certain
i m pediments to greatness. But thev should
rememlier that the melancholy donkiesare
not always successful, and that there is
more happiness in smiles than frowns.
Because humor has bee it fatal to Cox, and
men are adjudged and achieve crcatuess
in uronortion lotheirsnlpmnitv. ths vnnnoi
should not renounce their humor. A home
with lust one inmate who can find the
funny side of things, and whose laugh is

CZAK OF THE I'OI R SCAN.
Congress is in session, and now the Cin
cinn.ui t ommercml and its ally and suze
rain Capt. Cowdon are on the alert, busy
with doing work that will help the East
to get up material with which to defeat, if
it can, any sum being voted by Congress
for the improvement of the Mississippi
river. From the Commercial wo learned
two or three days ago, that the captain
had applied to the Mississippi river com
missioners for a hearing respecting his ab
surd but very cheap outlet svstem. The
commissioners, however, knowing that
Congress would allow them no damages
for what they would suffer while listening
to the usual outlet harangue, deolined, but
courteously gave the captain permission to
address them in writing. . A few days be
fore then the Commercial published a ukase
from the czar of all the outlets, which be
gins with the solemn announcement
the captain is always solemn : "I am go
ing to Washington to see what can be
done for the honest improvement of the
Mississippi river." He then states how
his enemies czars always have enemies
"are becoming desperate in denunciation
of myself." But he is not dismayed, like
a brave czar he declares: "The fight 'will
go on under the black-flag principle until
mose piunucrers are unven irom congress,
for it is a case of right on our part as
against wrong on their part, and right is
bound to win in the end. Therefore, we
neither ask nor irive onarter." The czar
of all the outlets and f the four Cs Cin
cinnati Commercial. Cowdon 4 Co. is evi
dently entering on the winter campaign

A FOOLISH SCHEME.

St. Loris, December 8. A dispatch from

tne United htates Court ot Claims to re
cover the value of slaves emancipated
during the war, says Oov. Ireland, Attor
ney-General Templeton and several prom
inent lawyers, consulted by the reporter,
scout the idea that lex as has any more
claim on the Federal government than
any other Southern State, and consider the
scheme a very foolish one. and that if any-
body is engaged in it, which is regarded as

Kansas City, Mo., December 8. After
the third trial, M. V. Jones was to-day ac

of murder. The history of the case is
brieily as follows: In the spring of 1882
George Giant, colored, resisting arrest for
larceny, killed Patrick Jones, a policeman.
A mob the same night hanged Levi Har
rington, colored, mistaking him for Grant.
M. V. Jones, a cousin of the deceased of
ficer, was charged with leading the crowd
which hanged Harrington, for which he
has just lieen acquitted. Grant, the mur

death, which has been deferred by a stay
of execution granted by the Supreme
Court.

pleasant one for the people. The pre
liminary season opened Friday, September
Zist, witn tne jonn ince (Jomedy (Jom

performances were given to moderate
audiences. ine second attraction was
Barlow & Wilson's Minstrel Company,
which appeared the following Monday
and Tuesday nights and Tuesday matinee
to full houses, the theater was then
closed until October 8th, when the regular
season begun with Haverly's Mastodon
Minstrels. There was not standing room
after 7:30 o'clock the first night, when
they produced their new burlesque, The
Princess of Madagascar. Their engage
ment closed the next Saturday night, and
they were followed on Monday by Milton
Nobles and company in his successful
comedies Interviews, Love and Law and
I he rhurmx. His engagement, which was
a remunerative one, closed Wednesday
evening, a Madison Square company ap
pearing Thursday night iia Esmeralda,
wnicn was wen patronized lunng their
engagement of three nights and one
matinee. Thomas W. Keene, the trage
dian, was the attraction the whole of the
following week. His engagement was not
a very successful one, on account ol bad
weather. Miss Lizzie Mav Vlmer drew
good houses Monday and Tuesday nights,
October 2i)th and 30th, as the heroine in
Forty-Xine. John T. Raymond followed
in In Paradise, repeating the play Thurs
day night aud presenting The Ilocket
Friday night and Saturday mati
nee, when his" ensraoement closed
November 5th and 6th Mme. Minnie Hauk
with her superb concert company opened
an engagement of two nights. The houses
were very good. Maud Granger in Her
Second Love, November 7th, 8th, 9th and
10th, was tolerably successful. The play,
Cad, lite Tomboy, with MissCRnie Swain in
the title role, was the next attraction, and
a good one. . Her engagement 6f three
nights and a matinee closed Wednesday
night, November 14th. One of the best
things of the season, and one which drew
good houses, was The Bajah, by a Madison
Square company, Thursday, Friday and
baturday and Saturday matinee. Horry
juicy s r tamer s o ije combination was
not as well patronized as it deserved. The
engagement of three nisrhtselosed Wednes
day, 21st. A farce entitled Strictly Busmen,
witn t. 1. Jiishop m the leading part,
closed the week. By far the best attraction
of the season was The ift t King, which
drew excellent audiences every nc;ht for
week, closing November :S0th. Li'iltto' Lon
don, which has been played to empty st ats
tor a weeK, closes the list, laken altogether,
the attractions so far this season have been
above the average, and the Memphis pub
lic has no cause lor complaint. The The
ater has been well managed and well pa
tronized. Jietter tilings are to come.
Minnie Madtlern.
The popular favorite, Miss .Minnie Mad
dern, supported by an excellent company,
will occupy our stage the whole" of this
week, presenting The Puritan Maid Mon
day, Tuesday and Wednesday nights and
Saturday matinee; Frott-Fron the balance
of the week. The St. Louis O iobc-Vcmo-crat
says: Miss Minnie Maddern opened
a week's engagement at Pojie's last even
ing in her new play, 1 he Puritan Maid.
"Madge," the heroine, is a merry, piquant
maiden whom an accident of birth has in
congruously placed in the bosom of a Pu
ritanical family in Salem, Mass., at that
early history of the pilgrims when every
natural emotion or lively outburst of sen
timent was regarded with a cold and for
bidding eye. The daughter of a straight
faced old deacon, she is, as the author puts
it, like an opal in a setting of iron. An
adventurer represents himself as the son
of the deacon's bosom friend, who has
been supposed to be lost at sea, and the
deacon, in fulfillment of nn old promise,
tries to betroth his daughter to the man
who, he supposes, hasa strongelairn upon
him. "Madge" is resolute in her hatred
of . the lover whom the deacon
would thrust upon her. A French vessel
is suddenly wrecked upon the Salein
shoals, and all the survivors captured ex
cept one voting man, who is sheltered by
"Madge.'' The adventurer finally, in re
venge, trumps up a number of "charges
against the young girl. She is tried for
witchcraft, and sentenced to be burnt at
the stake with the young foreigner. Not
until they have been tied to the stake does
the old deacon discover in a ring upon the
Frenchman's hand that he i3 in fact the
man who has the right to make tho claim
first advanced by the adventurer. The
prisoners are released, and the denouement
is the sanction of the old deacon to the
marriage of "Madge" and her lover. Miss
Maddern has done well in shelving her
old plays and substituting for them the
best production she has yet appeared in as
a star. Her talent is a pevnliar one, and
her acting is as unique as it is charming
and pleasing. A play written in the vein
of The Puritan iiaid is exceedingly well
adapted to her versatile powers.
Ons Williams.
A two-column sketch of Gus Williams
appears in last Sunday's issue of the New
York Dispatch. It is well written, p.nd pos
sesses a good deal of interest, especially on
account of the wide reputation and popu
larity of its subject. "Gus Williams's"
real name is Gustave William Levict, and
he was born at 121 Bowery, July 19, 1847.
His father was a Pole and his "mother a
native of county Cork, Ireland. His first
appearance in the metropolis was in Tony
Pastor's theater in November, 1808. He
remained with Pastor long after the latter
opened his Broadway theater. In 1879 he
made a new departure, appearing as "J.
Adolph Dinkelspiel" in the comedy-drama.
Our German Senator. Another drama, One
of the Finest, in which he now appears,
possesses many elements of humor, pathos
and homely, quaint sentiment, which have
thus far, with the work of Mr. Williams,
under his new manager, Mr. Howell Kobb,
insured it a substantial success. "Gus"
composed all the music and words of his
songs, and many of them have become,
through their "catching" melody, popular
and familiar in nearly. every city of the
V'nion. We all remem ber " Kaiser's Song,"
"Want to Buy a Dog," "Dot Little Gor
man," "Michael Snyder's Party," and "We
Never Miss tho Lager till the Keg Kims
Dry;" for, though published many a sea
son ago, they are still being repeated and
sung.

Prof. Allan Curr, of Scotland, .who lec
tured several years ago many times in
this city with great success, has been
engaged to deliver two of his most pop
ular and attractive lectures, as follows:
Central Baptist church, to-morrow (Mon
day) night, December 10th ; subject, "The
Master Passion, Ixive, and Wooing, Win
ning and Wedding." First Baptist church,
Tuesday might, 1 ecen;lier 11th ; subject,
"Men, Vomen, Things, and Mrs. Grundy."
At the close of the lectures, Mrs. Curr.who
is pronounced to be one of tho finest elo
cutionists of the day, will render several
choice selections. Prof. J. L. Johnson, of
the University of Mississippi, writes:
"I Hiring my residence of ten years here, I
have not heard his equal, and Mrs. Curr
recites with great beauty and power." The
Kev. Dr. McFarland, in a letter to the Rev.
Dr. Daniel, ofthisjeity.says: "I have heard
no lecturer in the "South equal to Prof.
Curr. Mrs. Curr has rare powers as an elo
cutionist." The Little Rock Gazette, August
28, 1883. says : "Prof. Curr is a fine speaker,
one of the most popular of our day a man
of surpassing personal magnetism and elo
quenceand held his audience spell
bound. Mrs. Curr read, and we have no
word to express our sensations save the
one enchantment" The Galveston Xetrt,
October 22, 1SS3: "He handled his sub
ject in a masterly manner. It was treated
by the eloquent speaker in a way that the
audience evidently regretted the lecture
had so soon ended." Mrs. Curr added great
ly to the evening's entertainment." Iktilu
Picayune, New Orleans, November 13, 1883 :
"Prof. Curr spoke with a fervor that roused
to the highest tension the nerves of the
audience. Mrs. Curr's voice is charming,
and her dramatic powers pronounced in
her recitals." The Memphis daily papers
of April, 1874, during Prof. Curr's previous
visit, speak in terms of the highest praise.
Admission to either lecture, fifty cents;
under fifteen vears, twenty-five cents; to
commence at 8 o'clock. Our citizens should

Jons G. Whittier called on Mr. G. W.
Cable in Boston last Tuesday, and it was
the first meeting of the two authors. "I
have read all thy stories," said the vener
able poet to the novelist, "and I like them
very much. Thee has found an untrodden
field of romance in New Orleans, and I
think thee the writer whom we have so
long waited to see come up in the South."

to each other, and it is perhaps "a pity they

Mario and Grisi did aforetime and scorn
society and defy the world.
Hexby Ward Beeciier was not a theater-goer
until late in life.- He says he has
enjoyed the plays and they did him good.
Others might not be affected by them in
the same way, and he therefore declines to
give a positive opinion upon theater at
tendance. He describes the excitement
which the plays wrought in hini as a sort
of intellectual intoxication.
W. E. Sheridan, the actor, recently
played to a distinguished audience in
Washington. President Arthur was in
one box, and Gens. Sherman and Sheri
dan in another. Sheridan, the actor,
served in the civil war as a captain under
Gen. Sherman, and also under Gen. Sheri
dan. His old commanders were the most
enthusiastic part of the audience.
Frederick Wakde, tlje tragedian, made
his first appearance on any stage as the
"Second Murderer" in MacMh. He has
earned his present position as a star by
hard and persistent work, beginning at
the lowett round of the ladder; he has
advanced step by step until ho now occu
pies a leading position as an exponent of
the legitimate drama. Mr. Warde is at
present playing in Texas with success.
After lying in tho vault since the 10th
of July last, the mortal remains of Mile.
Litta, the prima donna, were laid in the
grave at 11 o'clock Thursday morning, in
the Bloomington (111.) cemetery, the lot
being donated by Linus Graves, a wealthy
citizen and owner of the cemetery. At
the foot of the grave is a large burr oak
tree, with large spreading branches, and
the spot is otherwise adorned with well
trimmed shade trees and other foliage.

career at the Madison Square Theater. It

Mb. FitniiEiticn Wabdk has purchased a
tragedy entitled Mnnnon, written by Mr.
Henry Guy Carleton, and will prodiice it
during the present season. Memnon is de
scribed as a work of much power and
beauty. It was to have been produced a
few vears ago by Mr. John McCullough,
and for some reason was not placed upon
the stage by that actor. Mr. McCullough
stands in dread, apparently, of new plays.
Mr. Warde is now acting with success in
the South.
Emma Abmott said when she married
Wetherel, that Clara Louise Kellogg had
advised her against it, saying: "Don't
make the awful mistake of getting married.
Don't ever marry while you are singing.
Make the divine art your only spouse ; if
you don't you will rue it Then the
petite advisee laughed and added:
So I went and got married. But Miss
Kellogg doesn't need a husband to look
out for her, she has such a splendid man
aging mamma!"
Mr. Edwis Booth, whose engagement
at the Star Theater, New York, will begin

where by the simple expedient of suspend

swarms of fireflies Hitting about a tropical

and the effect, as the artificial fireflies Hash

Says the Philadelphia Times: "Janau
scliek played to immense business at the
Grand Operahouse, New York, the past
week, people being turned away at every
performance." As a matter of fact, dur
ing the performance of this excellent ac
tress at the Grand Operahouse there was
at any time plenty of room for 200 or 300
eople if they had applied for tickets, and
at no time was there an audience which
in any sense of the word packod the house.
What share of patronage as an artist she
deserved is another question.
Better dressing-rooms are needed. In
nine out of everv ten theaters in the
country they aro disgracefully inadequate.
In some cases the rooms are inferior to the
stalls in which lieasts are stabled ; dreari
ness, dirt and discomfort are their chief
characteristics. Actors deserve better of
their employers. The well-being and
happiness of the people behind the cur
tain should be studied as well as the luxu
rious inclinations of those in front. Uur
theaters are the most beautiful in the
world, but their accommodations for the
players are absolutely the worst.
A four-act comedy, by Mr. David D.
Lloyd, was presented on Friday evening
last at tho National Theater, New York,
by Mr. John T. Raymond and his compa
ny, in the presence af an audience includ
ing the President, many leading Senators
and members of Congress, and an extraor
dinary gathering of representatives of the
press. It was an eloquent attestation of
the dullness of the Speakership light that
so large a body of active politicians and
newspaper men could at so late a time in
the contest find an opportunity to aban
don the canvass to look on and laugh at
Mr. Lloyd's amusing play. Tho friends of
the journalist,and they are many, will hear
with pleasure that For Congress was re
ceived with unmistakable favor, and that
it promises to be a decided success. The
character of "General Josiah Limber," the
man who has been elected successively to
the position of legislator, speaker, lieutenant-governor,
and major-general, and who
has at last become an impecunious wire
puller, it is said, fits Mr. Raymond like a
glove.
Thk New York Evening Post, says that
Henry living's "Hamlet, even when con
sidered indeiendently of his chronic
faults, cannot be ranked with the best im
personations given here by tragedians of
established fame, but it is, nevertheless, a
most interesting1, even fascinating, per
formance, as full of suggestions as it is of
contradictions. In the matter of costume,
it is a tolerably close copy from the well
known portrait of John Philip Kemble,
and the manner of treatment is loose,
modeled after the slow and measured
style of the Kemble school. Of the actor's
own private conception of the part it is
difficult to speak positively, although
many eloquent and dogmatic explanations
of this point have been printed. It would
probably puzzle Mr. Irving himself to de
fine exactly the condition of his "Ham
let's"' mind. ' In many instances his mad
ness is clearly feigned, but in others, in
the play-scene, for instance, the symptoms
of genuine insanity appear to be plainly
marked. I'erbaps the safest conclusion
will be that the "Prince" is only mad
Nor' Nor' West. Consistency is not one
of Mr. Irving's strongest characteristics,
and his "Hamlet," like his "Shylock," is
a dual personage.

To tho Editors of the Appeal :
Forrest City, Aek., December 7. My
attention has been called to an article in
your issue of the 4th instant that does me
great injustice. I was never arrested in
Helena, as your correspondent could have
known by a little effort upon his part to
ascertain the facts iu the ease. It is true
that two gentlemen who accompanied me
got into trouble, anil all I had to do wun
the matter was to pay the fines and costs
for them. It is equally false that I dis
turbed anyone on the train from Helena
to Colt's .Station. It is true that I did pun
ish an insolent negro porter on the arrival
of the train at Colt's Station for insulting
language used toward me at Forrest City.
For this I have no arology to make. " 1 be
lieved then, and still believe. I was justi
fied in what I did. I hope you will do mo
the justice to correct the statement mado

To the lUIitora of the Appeal :
It is singular that after some recent ex
pressions of tolerablv just sentiments on
the matter of the rights and privileges duo
to all citizens in public places, you should,
in a leading article to-day i December (th i,
again deliberately confound 'Vocial equal
ity" with the rights of men wit preference
to public accommodations. You mut
know that this is unfair, even though the
object be to secure a stroke nt an opposite
political party thereby. You nllinn that
in the past legislation by the Republican
party toward establishint the citizenship
oi the negro and securing to him the rights
belonging to tho same, in common with
other citizens, the object of that party has
been to force socitd equality between the
races. This is certainly n revelation.
Does any intelligent reader of the Appear
suppose lor a moment uiat ueiiigaparu
ger in the same railway coach, or accom
modated at tho same hotel, makes one
man the social equal of another? Men
of all colors and characters meet in the
crowded street-car, tho omnibus, and in
many parts of the country on all railway
trains they enjoy the same "teneral accom
modations. Does this have anything to
do with the social relation? An editor of
the A ppkai. may lie seated at the fame
table in a hotel with men who are liher
tines of the most corrupt character, or
with others exceedingly ignorant, un
cultured in mind; he mayride in the same
railway car with them, and will he admit
that he is thereby their social equal, and
obliged to recognize them as such, seek
their acquaintance, or invite them to his
house? And yvt the argument he puts
forth amounts to an affirmative answer to
this question. Hut he would be indignant
at the idea, and yet if even the most
decent black man "is granted similar or
equal privileges and accommodations in
public places," it is social equality. If, as a
citizen, he is denied just treatment in
such places, and an eil'ort is made to pro
tect him bv law, it is "forcing social
equality." Why not fairly come out and
sav, "Ve hate "men whom the Creator
has given a dark skin, and for that
reason, no matter what their condition or
character in other respects, we propose to
retain the negro as a target for our abuse.
Our side of the 'eternal negro' question
is that all measures looking toward his
freedom and the rights of citizenship have
been unconstitutional, and we want to
hear of no proposition by which he shall
be given simple justice as though he were
not guiltv of having a black skin and once
a slave." This, Messrs. F.ditors, would define
vour position, if we understand you at all
on this subject. Why not put it in plain
words? Long ago Charles Sumner an
swered your sad refrain : "The country is
weary of the eternal negro (with small n)
in politics." Snmner said: "Do what is
just and right toward the Negro, and then
we will get rid of the subject." Peace and
Righteousness are the two individuals
who, if vou please, must be social equals.
Class legislation will be uncalled for when
all classes are treated justly. Your com
plaints are much like that ol the man who,
though unwilling to pay an honest debt,
was exceedingly annoyed by the visits of
his creditor. " b. A. imes.

The circular above alluded to is headed
"The Importance of Industrial Education
for Women," and signed by Pauline
Holmes. After reviewing the resources
hitherto open to women, and their ovei
crowded condition, the circular points out
the opportunities which lie in industrial
design, by which women may' earn troni
$1200 to St'iOtH) per annum, according to
ability, and says:
The question of tennhinir women in America
thearta uf drMs-n has becu lvcil by Mr. J- l-T-ence
K. Cory, hersi!!- a priicticul ilrsijrner. .
Cory in ji jrradii.itc ol" Cooper I iiin, Hiid in 1S77
taught in that iuylituto the firt l;ii-s in practical
enrpet Ufi(rnini? ever estnt.ihcd f"tr women iu
this country. After letivinr Coojtcr 1'nion .Mrs.
Cory to. a a tiiorou--h course of iiutruetion in

carpet factory in New YotkCity. Alterward ihc
vieiled a representative feti.ry of nearly every
art industry in the I'nited states, studyinr in
each the technicalities of the machinery and the
practical requirements of the deaipu lor these va
rious industries, thus qunlifyinir herself to be the
best as well as the first teacher in praetit-ul de
sinn for industrial purposes in America. In lssl
Mrs. Cory established a School of Indusrrinl Art
for Women, having soventy-five pupils, at ber
residence, last year, r-he has now taken a larro
suit of rooms in tho Grand. Operahouse, and pro
poses to establish free classes for women and riris
in industrial dcsimi. the only requirements for an
admission being-a fair amount ol intelligence, a
taste and appreciation of the beautiful, and the
need of such benefit, with the expectation of be
coming self-supporting. Pupils hnve the priv
ilege of selling their work made while under in
struction (several hundred dollars were so earned
by the pupils of last year), the only requirement
being that one-fourth the amount received for
such work shall e retained toward a fund for an
Art Library, samples, drawings, etc., needed by
the school: also each pupil, at the end of the
year, shall leave one drawing as the property of
the school. The behoid of Industrial Art for
Women is the only one in America which possess
es a Jacquard carpet loom, when the practical ap-
rilication of the design of the fabric may be il
ustrated. Many other things are needed, howa,
ever, in the way of apimratus. books, charts, etc.
Contributions are therefore solicited from lilieral
minded people, who are disposed to help in the
guod work, and will be thankfully received by
the managers of the school, lor. as James A. Gar
field said, "at present the most valuable gift
which can be bestowed on w-jtnen is something
to do which they can do well and worthily, and
thereby maintain themselves. "

in my possession. The sentiment ex
pressed therein struck me as being of high
and unusual order. Please examine the
manuscript and see if yon can make it

BELLE BRIGHT ELDER.
AX EXTRACT FROM A WOMAN'S DIART.
Saturday night I fell into temptation. It is a
very eommon domestic sin, one which I have been
often led to contemplate, one which 1 have been
betrayed into al most as often as the temptation
ha presented itself, and one from which,! hv
ever foundit difficult to extricate myself, which
n" eaacea me more loitering than any oilier
thing and which has created otora mar and been
heavier weight to prevent elevatioa of life. A
in that blinds me, that stares a current of
thought swift and strong enough to sweep back
the regular peaceful flow ol my mind and spirit
into irregular channels; channels which, in my
normal condition, are abhorred and feared. And
what is this sin? It is what the evil one uses as
his most powerful weapon to keep married life
from accomplishing what Ood intends it the sin
of quick wrath at offences followed by resentment
of manner. The wife most shun this path as
deadly. What husband is there who does not say
nnkind words, who does not use unkind tones,
hurtiug. yes. always hurting, the tendert devoted
heart of the woman bound to hnn? but
what must she? Now, if she would only
consider sue would know her husband, in these
little petulances, appeals to her to help him from
himself. It is very rare, although he may be
sorry for the wrong, that he will say so; but he
will be very grateful to his wife if the wrong
E asses, her love unscathing it, if she will lay her
ead upon his eareesingly. if she will not have
her form stiffen from him; he will love her very
tenderly as a great good to him if her heart holds
him warm, the love in her eyes not flickering un
der these injustices. llow abjectl how mean:"
many will exclaim. "A husband will soon grow
cross in his exactions, and his love will actually
die fed by such rank adulation.' This is what
my own heart exclaimed, last Saturday night, as
1 held coldly aloof separating my husband from
nie. But a wife eannot stay separated from her
husband without falling. She will fall in two
ways. Her hold upon her husband will loosen,
who instinctively looks to her for help in his
Sliiritual life, and if she shows incapacity her
main strength in hie affection will lie gone. A
woman niut evince herself pureand good to have
the best of a man's heart. She will
fall in her own spiritual grade. Nature
and God make tenderness her scepter
let ner lav it uown ana sue can no longer
rule. She has no other weapon to. combat bitter
ness, injustice, or even cruelly. VI ith tnis weapon
she can tame and eleiate a brute. Put in its place
resentment, auger and coldness, and she is less
than powerless she is despised. A man can live
without a woman ; he can ignore her: can let die
his better instincts; can let slip out that part of
nun which is sentiment, ana by which he is led to
a higher and holier nature. Can a woman? I tup
pose it is possible, but behold ber a monster next
to a demon it is a rare, very rare phenomena.
This craving fur love, and craving to loe, is wo
man's largest vitality, ll is man's salvation to
be invested with it. A woman puts forth a thou
sand unseen, and seen, arms to draw him to the
hights by it : he cannot withstand, cannot elude
the force which engulphs him. it is an atmo
sphere his soul breathes even when he is uncon
scious; it is a solace, a supiHirt, a strength which
has a foundation to his whole being a foundation
he does not recognise very otten, but never! helers
one lrom which he receives his main flow of
power, and which is bearing him irresistibly
toward spiritual bights. This is the true lore: the
love laat does not lull, the love which, as eloau
and line skin throws olf water, throws etf without
deface all littleness from the one it enclasps. It
is the love whose soft-eyed tenderness doos not
nicker at injustice, which can remain steadfast
even under disloyalty, knowing human nature is
easily tempted, knowing it must cleave fast to
aid in "suffering him. her earthly lord, not to be
led into temptation," to aid in "delivering
him from evil." O. the graudeur of a love like
that and the gratituile of the soul of man tor sueli
love! Ine only love that uoa approves; the eni
love that abets llim in his plan of salvation, i
wifewhoenii seeherhusbandso teuiltted: who can
re;ilire that his passiou has gone astray from her
aud is mad for auother; who cau. covering up her
anguish of soul as one being crucified uiHn tho
cross, cle.-ire fast to aid him through the dark pe
riod of fall and sin. having no anaer. no strife.
only infinite sorrow as one crucified upon the
cross, letting no hold go but "paticut in tribula
tion, rejoicing, in hope, continuing instant in
liraver.' A wife who ran love thus is acceptable
to tied and in llis sight of great price. Such a
love could reclaim a man had ho well-nigh en
tered hell. It is this loi e God designs to aid man
and woman toward heaven, and there exist no
agency so pewerlul.

THK EELL M ATCH CASE.
A Statement from Mr. Roll RcR-nrdina"
he .Halter.
To the Editors of the Appeal :
I desire to make an explanation through
your columns in regard to the warrant
sworn out against me by a drunken fellow
by the name of Jones, upon which I was
tried before Judge Hadden Saturday morn
ing. The judge promptly sistnissed the
case, as the evidence showed there was
nothing in it. It showed that the party
received the exact watch that ' the
guaranty called for, and that it was worth
fully the price paid for it, and often Bold
for more money. The judge iu rendering
liis decision, while be held that the charge
of swindling had not been sustained,
seemed to be under the impression that
some fraud had perhaps leen practiced,
from the fact that the guarantee called for
a solid gold case watch, while the watch
sold was a low prade of gold case and was
not all gold. 'While this error was perhaps
natural on the part of the judge, on ac
count of his inexperience in tiie matter
of jewelry and watches, it nevertheless
has a tendency to alb-ct nie injuriously,
and 1 make -this statement for
the purpose of correcting this error.
I will state as a matter of fact no solid
gold-case watch has a case of pure gold.
Kvery case has moro or less alloy ; they
vary from four to eighteen karats. Tho
price varies accordingly. When a party
buys a watch he knows what sort of a
watch he is getting from the price he pays
for it. I keep on hand a full assortment
of watches, from the low grades to eight
een karats line, which 1 sell at auction,
and when I give a gunrantee a watch will
always come up to my guarantee. My
goods are consigned to me to sell. I have
sold fourteen aud eighteen karat watches,
and I can bring tho parties forward that
have bought them. 1 sell all classes of
goods, from four karats to eighteen karats,
in watches; imitation and genuine dia
monds, mid sell them for vhut Oiey are.
The man that bought the watch was not
drunk when he bought the watch. I will
not cell a dollar to a drunken man if I
know it. I have done business in Mem
phis too long to have my reputation in
jured by every dead-beat who does not
get If 100 for $25. There is. not a jeweler
in your city who does not sell different
grades of "gold watches. There is no
jewelry made in gold cases or chains of
pure gold. I have come to Memphis to
stay, and I cannot afford to swindle tho
public. I can get a hundred names of
your citizens who have bought goods at
this sale, and at my sale in February last.
I have sold .over )(KI dozen of Kogers's
knives at this sale at from $1 40 to $1 75 a
set. I have sold at this sale over $1000
worth of the erby Silver l'lato Company
ware that was quadruple plate. If I urn
swindling the public they ought to know
it. I will thank anyone to call at my
rlace of business and "examine my goods,
do not want to depreciate the price of
goods, but if jewelers insist on making
lalse statements in regard to the goods I
sell, I will ojien a re. nil business and put
prices lower than they can buy them. I
do not want to do this, but I can and will
unless they attend to their own business
and let mine alone. I will say for
the benefit of those jewelers who have tried
to injure niv business (this is not intended
for those jewelers who have attended
to their own business) I can give a dis
count of 3oJ, 10, 15, 10, 5 per cent. Now,
if they want me to put goods at that price
keep on, and see who comes out ahead.
I wish to My there is one jeweler in par
ticular, and one of the best in the city,
who has not to my knowledge made any
thing but true statements in refcrenco to
good bought at my store, lie has brain
capacity enough to know that it will never
fav to try to injure one man's business to
mild up his own. As well mnva man try
to build up bis own character by running
down his neighbor. I like Memphis. I
have made many friends. I shall do a
feneral auction and commission business,
will sell any class of merchandise for I ho
merchants of Memphis or elsewhere, pro
vided tiie goods are not limitetL Then,
when people visit my store they will know
that the goods will be sold to the highest
bidder. I will work hard to get every dol
lar I can for the merchant who puts goods
in my care, and should anyone happen to
pay, "of his own free will, a retail price for
an article, I hope I shall not lie arrested
as a swindler. Itut, should 1 be unfortu
nate again, I am willing to have my case
tried before his honor, Judge lladden. I
will in Monday's or Tuesday's issue pub

says: "O'Donnell will no doubt lie hanged

that Kngland shows no mercy, and that
