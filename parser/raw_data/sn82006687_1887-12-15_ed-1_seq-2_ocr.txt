W# give on our first \>%* the whole
of President Cleveland e Message to
Congress. and hope that it will be
real with the care and attention
which it deserves. The meseage deals
with but one subject but to bread*
winners that subject is the all impor
tant one. The President slates clearly
and forcibly the case of the people
against the monopolists and for the
sake of the country it is to be hoped
that his admonitions will not fall upon
deaf ears.
The I’nited States Supreme Court
on Monday decided the Kansas pro
hibition law to be constitutional.
Justice Harlan, who del.vered the
opinion, said that “the State had a
right to prohibit the liquor traffic; it
•lid not thereby take away the pro
perty of the brewers, it simply abated
a nuisance.”
A caucus of the democrat aof the
Virginia Legislature on 1 hursday
night, unanimously nominated Hon.
John S. Harbour for Inited States
Senator to succeed Senator Hiddle
berger from March Ith, l s V*. A
nomination is e juivalent to an elec
tion.
The recent Maryland Farmers' Con
vention adopted the report and lax |
bill to be presente 1 to the Legislature,
submitted by c -pedal committee
charged with the work. The taxation [
of mortgages is one ot the chiet points
in the hill. That provision requires
the mortgagee to pay upon the amount
of his mortgage, and the balance is
assessed to the mortgagor.
It may he set down to the credit of
the Cleveland Administration that up
to October Ist no less than 4i,bt* >, *94
a'Tes have been lestoted to the public
domain, irom railroads, and other cor
porations (hat had secured them ille
gally under Republican rule, and
proceedings have been instituted for
the restoration of more than nine
millions more. 1 hese restored lands,
in the aggregate lour times greater -
than the area of Maryland, and nearly
equal to that of Pennsylvania, will
now be thrown open to bona tide
settlers.
The New York Star says the call
for the Republican National Conven
tion is a formal notice to all who do
not believe in the doctrine of high
protective monopoly to leave the lie
publican party. None others are
wanted to join National Committee
man Howell Clayton and his associates
in the support of Blame. No anti
nionopolists need apply for Republi
can electoral ballots. The reduction
of the Republican torces to the num
ber of out and out, thick and thin
Blame monopoly men will greatiy
simplify f he political situation ot ISS**,
The Peoi i e with Him.—The Prov
idence i li. IA Journal, one of the
ablest repub icau papers published in
New Kngland, says of the President s
message that “it is a practical and
business-like document, that he has
with him the people, and that the only
great question is American politics
now is the economic one. Ihe Hon.
Wm. I. Washburn, a prominent Min
nesota republican, and one ot the lead
ing tlonr mills owners in the North
west, pronounces the President s mes
sage “a bold, courageous document.
Mr. W ashburn says the President ' has
given a lull, fair ami manly expres
sion of his views, which are correct
from the standpoint of American pro
gress and development. Mr. Wash
bum further says that “it is an out
rage upon the people ol America that
the two political parlies should b
struggling to make political capital
out of such an economic question as
the tariff when the danger of finan
cial contraction is threatening the
country.
Five hundred and forty-nine hills
were introduced in the U. S. Senate
Moudav, among the lot being one by
Senator Blair to aid in the establish
ment and temporary support ot com
in on schools and one by Senator
I'olph to apj ropnate Sli6,d7T,st.o for

In the House of Representatives,
among other bills which Mr. Compton
hs prepared for introduction, ja one
appropriating to establish a
new light house at Cobb Point Bar,
at the mouth of Ihe W icomico river.

i Correspondence of the BeaconA i
Wasuisgtos, Dec. 13, lbß7.
Messrs Editors:—The opening of
Congress, the meeting of the National
Republican Committee, and the an
nual session of the American Evangel
ical Alliance have contributed to
tender the past week a memorable one
in the history of Washington. The
Associated Press dispatches furnished
a graphic representation of the scenes
at the Capitol upon the opening day
of the swision, out they convey but a
poor idea of the keen sense of disap
{•ointment felt by the crowds that
rilled the galleries long before the hour
of opening, who anticipated witnessing
exciting and animated proceedings.
The questions with reference to the
seating of certain Senators had been
amicably arranged in joint caucus
held during the morning, and as no
emergency arose, those who had
struggled to get into the crowded
galleries, hardly felt recompensed for
their pains. The opening scenes in
the House of Representatives were not
unlike those attending the opening
day ot a session. The doors of the
galleries were thrown open at an early
hour, and soon every seat was oc
cupied and the corridors were crowded.
There was an unusually large atten
dance of ladies. The lloral gifts to
l the Members were both numerous and
• beautiful. Here, however, as in the
Senate, the spectators who had ex
pected to witness an unusually excit
ing opening were disappointed. The
only excitement was occasioned by a
religious crank in the main gallery,
who, as the roll was about to be called,
arose and in a loud voice requested
all present to Join him in singing the
old and famili r hymn “Praise God
from Whom all Blessings Flow, ’ and,
waving bis hands he proceeded losing
at the top of his voice. The gallery
was so crowded that it was impossible
for the officers to reach him until he
had finished the song. After the
: election of officers of the House, the
! diawing for seats was commenced.
It was highly amusing to watch the
expressions upon the faces of some of
the unfortunate members as the best
seats were selected before their names
were called.
The President created a decided
sensation by sending to Congress the
shortest annual message ever written
and by devoting it entirely to a single
subject. The reading of the message
was listened to with marked attention
by both M mbers and spectators, and
the subject of the message and its
probable effect upon the coming Pres
' idenlial contest has been the theme of
discussion during the week. The
more timid Democrats are apprehen
sive as to its effect, while the Repub
licans claim that the message will
enhance the strength of their party in
the manufacturing districts. What
ever the effect may be, it is generally
f conceded that the message will prove
, the foundation ct the coming Presi
dential contest.
The Evangelical Alliance, which
commenced its session at the Congre
, galional Church on Wednesday, at
tracted to the city a large number of
prominent church workers from all
sections of the country. The sessions
Lave been extremely interesting and
so largely attended that it was found
necessary to hold overflow meetings 1
in other churches. Prof. Boyeson,
who is a naturalized citizen of the
I’nited States, lead a paper before the
Alliance on Thursday evening upon
the subject of “Immigration,” 'which
has attracted universal and wide
, spread attention. He pointed out the
evils arising from unrestricted im
migration, and ihe disastrous conse
quences sure to follow. When an
intelligent foreigner, who allies his 1
interests with ours, informs us that it
is time to throw obstacles in the way
of pauper immigration, we tnav well
take heed,
T..e National Republican Committee
at its session at the Arlington Hotel
on Thursday last, listened to the
claim- presented by the several cities
and finally decided upon Chicago as
the place and the iHth of Tune the
date for bolding the Nominating Con
vention. The meeting of the com
mittee was an interesting one, and all
the members processed to entertain
I the brightest hopes for ;be future.
jTbefntnds of Mr. Biaine Lad full
control, and it is now Socked upon as
a certainty that he will again make
the race with Mr. Cleveland. Mr.
Biaire’a prompt comments upon the
President's Message arc also consider
ed as a significant indication cf h.s
intentions.
Now that Mr. Sparks has ceased to
hold the office of of it
General Land Office, a good story u'
jr
told as having occurred oaring h i
recent administration. A report was
received at the Department last year
from a man in Montana, stating that
upon many of the streams in the Ter
ritory quantities of timber had been
cut down and was lying indtoctimi- I j
nately about upon the ground white)
it Lad been left to rot, while a email |
proportion of the trees only weie used
in building houses and dams. A
special agent was at once sent all the ■
way to Montana to investigate the
matter, who, upon inquiry, was in
formed that the damage was entirely ,
the work of the beavers, y one of the
old families in Montana). The Com
missioner decided that it would hardly
be wise to institute suit for damages
and so the matter dropped.
