"Pne foam of passion and frenzy bathe J
Gideon Hone's lips. Like a madman he
tore at the bars, raving out incoherent
rac anj defeat.
Hi prt-y had escaped him and, too,
bted and sparred for the flight.
Well he knew that before he could reach
the .oof an.- descend to earth, Kane
won d Le out of the building, speeding
through the sheltering labyrinths of the
plant to some point of obsecuriiy.
Fear would lend hira wings, money
would purchase him the means of evading
pursuit. Oh ! this man must be overtaken
checked, here now !
Hope regained terra Grma, running a
race of reckless risks he never realized.
He was out of breath, his clothing torn
his frame wrenched and bruised. He re
flected quickly, then in a flash he acted.
Lightning quick he made for a tower a
few hundred yards across the molding
yard. An engine house, elongated from its
l√§se, nd tteam was hiding thence, but
but slowly.
In through the open doorv. ay Hope
lashed. The man in charge was lolling on
n Lencn. smoking. Hope ran up to him,
Eeized him, brought him to his feet with
a jerk and four mystic words the secret
paSTvords of the inner circle of that great
Industrial federation, "the Amalgamated."
The man started at him in wonder.
"Hello!" he stammered.
"You understand'"' retorted Hpe in
pistol-shot sharpness.
"What's np a strike?"
"No. an order, postive for the good of
th society."
"All right"
"See, I have the power to comnand."
Hope exhibited a disc. The man bowed
In profound obeisance, as he traced it3
symbolic inscriptions.
"Turn on the arc lights quick!" di
rected Hope "over the whole plant, clear
down the main road."
"That's queer I"
"Do it !"
"You bet it's a mystery, J)Ut the Amal
i"ve incrir'ntion, ere he handed him over
to just ire.
"It does."
"Then here goes!"
He sprang to a dynamo crank. Soon the
bright wheels were whirring, the sparks
flying.
Magic illumination prevailed where
grim blackness had reigned, somber and
dense, before.
"Light!" exulted Gideon Hop-, anA ran
cat. id e, darted up the "tower ladder,
strained his eager sight across the la J
scape.
The crystalline streaks of blinding radi
ance nit air and sky in every direction.
At last a great welling cry parted Hope's
ardent lips.
There, to the west, making for an in
tricate network of railway tracks beyond
the works, a black speck was diving away
Kane.
What innst he have thought to be sud
denly blinded, overtaken by the fast
and far-extending circuit of electricity !
He could not hide or evade he could only
put on, making off fast as he could for
shelter, obscurity, where the jungle of
tracks and trains showed a mile ahea of
him. " - ,
One look, one sr.re estimate of course,

durance, atd Gideon Hope was on his

purster and pursued were fairly clear of
the ilant li&'nts, but the feebler thoigh
more frequent lamps of the vast switch
yards still served to guide the former, and
the latter was almost continually in sight.
A fierce joy thrilled Hope. The very
peril of being baSed, the exhilarating zest
of a new hunting down, made this second
capture the more precious and treasured.
I have yoa !" shouted Hope.
A moving train of freight cars blocked
the fugitive. He turned at bay.
Kane snarlec". and showed his teelkrlle

coupling-pin aay weapon of assault or
defense.
None was at hand. His fingers hugged
close to his breast the precious fortune so
nearly won.
"(Jive it up," said Gideon Hope," his
eyes glittering with triumph as he advanc

His desperate foe had courted death
rather than surrender. Kane dropped to
his knees. A last glance of bitter hatred
he flnng at his unrelenting pursuer. Then
he threw himself past the moving tracks
of a freight car, scrambling across the
road'jed.
A howl of agony rent his lips .Quick
and spry, infused with terrific courage
and resolve, he might have got across the
other rail, oily that the money package
fclipped from his grasp.
Hope sprang forward to seize it, for it
lay fat, freed for moment, directly balanc
ing on top of the smooth, silver-clear rail.
And then-a grinding wheel struck it,
moving quicker than human groping
hands.
Squarely, evenly, the fiance cot it in
two one-half fell outside the rail, one
half inside.
Kane snatched up one fragment, Hope
the other. -
A fisb, a rustle, and the schemer
threw bi.nself free of the tracks on the
other aide.
When the train had passed he was no
where to be seen.
Gideon Hope stood glancing all about
the brightly illuminated switch-yard.
- "Slipped me, eh?" he murmured. "But
only for a time I I have clipped his wings
I have robbed him of his power half
the two hundred and fifty thousand do)
Urs!" And he waved the severed bank
notes. "A part, waste paper and with
out money what is he? A skulking, help
less beggar! Percy Kane, a brief respite,
if you. choose, but you are beaten, mine
I shall ruin the game in the end !"
.
At daylight Gideon Hope was his old
o!d, critical, caculating self.
Ilea son had succeeded to the furious'
-ehjn of passion and recklessness. He felt
that he held the reins of fate cnrely in
his grairp. He had modified his plans, nt
the sane time giving reenforcement to the
power that must eventually enmesh aad
drag to justice the fugitive, Kane.
A score of trusty, willing aides those
same who has assisted in overthrowing
the political ring of the state were now
secretly, diligently searching for a trace of
Kane.
He conld not go far a beggar Hop
realized, and after setting his new pro
jects at work he calmly reflected over the
labor done, the final results attaining

maine and hl3 beautiful daughter, Claire.
Ah! a new inspiration filled the man's
oul as he comprehended that hrisk. bright
morning that he could so to Cltire and
inform her that accident or rather sub
terfuge had brought Kane' to bay, and
no longer need she continue her hateful
part, nor her father remain in obscurity.
True, no tangible evidence sought for
had been discovered by Claire that would
jreiy incriminate Kane in the Kverett
Hop murder. But had he not "con
fessed !"
And Gideon Hope shuddered now ns he
recalled how sternly Inflexible in his reso
endetta
J. COBB
lution he had bidden pure, innocent Claire
Tremaine go even to the nltar with the
arch-schemer, but his secret must be
wrested from him.
And now he could go to Claire, tell
her how his plans had fructified more
speedily than he had anticipated; how
secret information she had obtained con
cerning the evil sehemings of the Trust
had enabled him to bring the soulless
magnates to ruin; how Kane was a beg
gar ad a fugitive! She could drop her
mask, and Albert Tremaine could reap
pear and, going into court with the proofs
of the swindlers infamy Hope had se
cured, obtain justice, restitution, riches!
He could say to Claire, too the man's
heart roused, warmed, as he thought cf
her sunny face, of the new impetus love
had given to life whenever the brooding
tragedy of the past was temporarily ob
scured. That morning Hope went to the house
where Claire had been living since se
curing her position at the works.
He asked for her under the name she
had gone by since assuming her nw role.
The landlady greeted him, and looked
and acted curious and puzzled, as she
said:
t "She is not here, sir sTie has gone V
"Gone!" repeated Hope, blankly.
"Yes, sir."
"When?"
"This morning early."
"Where?" a vague sensation of pain
struck the speaker's heart.
"I do not know."
"Alone?"
"X no, sir. Peril a p. a note she left
will explain."
"For me?"
"Yes, sir."
She went to her room, returned, handed
her visitor a sealed envelope.
Gideon Hope tore it open an ley hand
seemed to clutch his heart as he read a
chronicle of unfaltering fealty, of awful
sacrifice, of broken-hearted despair.
For Claire was indeed gone, lost, and
Percy Kane had triumphed.

Gideon Hope stood dazed, crushed ; a
hideous blight seemed to have suddenly
struck down courage, manhood, resolve
the sacrifice had been consummated. He
had driven into tha arms, the toils, of his
mos: bitter enemy the one being on earth
lie worshiped next to the memory of his
sainted brother.
Could aught atone!
A recognition of the daring, utter tri
umph of Percy Kane, aided and abetted
by his own unconscious t'o-operation, ap
palled the man! At that moment, stand
ing blinded and heart-sick at the threshold
of fair CI lire Denslow's recent home, in
pitiful subjugation to fate, to doom, he
realized how puny, how shadow-like, were
the vanished powers of will and passion
when pitted against the relentless, un
yielding force of circumstance.
And now, revenge, hatred, the fierce
joy of running down a foe, the glory of
annihilating a political party and oblit
erating a giant trust all. all, faded into
nothingness, as mere filmy wreaths of
smoke. These that had seemed so muc
were nothing in the face of a stern new
presentment Claire! Claire!
He had counted his enemy done for, a
fugitive at his sole will, a candidate for
th gallows when he elected. He had
torn from Kane's grasp the fortune he had
sought to carry away in flight to obscur
ity, and had gone home and slept, smil
ing, fiercely confident of holding his vic
tim in the palni of his hand.
But Gideon Hope, shrewd, keen reader
of mind i.nd master of men that he was,
had not weighed aright the boundlt-ss re
wwrces, the daring character of Percy
Kane. In the apparent death throes of
a supreme crucial struggle, the embezzler
and assassin had dealt a blow, quick and
deep, that humbled, palsied, crushed the
victor of an hour.
If It were a subtle, ferocious stroke of
revenge, the very iron of its cankering
essence deprived Hope of momentary
thought and action. If it was merely the
blundering afterthought of the miscreant
ah ! had he not won what was more
worthy than fortune, or fame, a radiant.
peerless being, who typifid to Hope all
that was beautiful on earth in life!
Hope staggered from the doorway in
which, puzzled and alarmed, stood the
wonder-faced landlady.
"What shall I say to him?" he gasped:
"to Denslow; Claire father!"
A sickening, sense of responsibility
swayed him. When he had undertaken
the scheme that was to bring Kane and
his thieving colleagues to ruin, he had
promised Denslow restitution. He could
offer it now. In such a shape were the
affairs of the metal combination, in pos
session of such irrefragible evidence con
cerning its underhand, primary dealings
was Hope, that in the inevitable reorgan
ization of the wreck Denslow's just and
pretentious claim could not be set aside
but what of that other element, far more
dear to the fond parent's heart Claire?
For while Denslow, in retirement at a
distance, had consented that his daughter
should assist Hope in his schemes, he had
no Idea how completely Claire had meant
her promise to oley this strange secret
friend, how far he, the master mind,
would require her to proceed in order io
get the toils fast and effectual about the
wily wrecker.
When the new and unexpected vista
had opened that brought Kane within
Hope's power, as man to man, the self
confessed murderer of Everett Hope, the
crisis was past and, thrilled with strange
new ardor, the possibilities of love and
its rewards appealed to his soul, and Gid
eon Hope had hastened to apprise Claire
of a victory only to face a defeat, an un
expected revelation that seemed to sweep
the very ground from beneath his feet.
He might find "Claire ah ! yes, as he
bed known he could drag from hiding hi
arcL enemy when he wanted him but
how? A wife ! the bride og the blackest
scoundrel the wide earth knew; and he,
the almoner of this mad, wicked rite, that
gave innocence and shuddering, shrinking
horror into the keeping of villainy !
The thought maddened him a blood
red mist obscured clear vision I Yet. too
late! too late! lie bad willed the sacri
fW. and as a Iamb to the slaughter poor
Claire had jrone, a very victim to blind
davotion and love.
It seemed as If infinite pity banished
all other emotions now in his sheer help
lessness this strong man wince; he even
trt-niblvd.
Illindly, vaguely, he went from the spo
seeing nothing, caring for nothing, hi3
dulled mind directing this course till. the
shock of the hour losing its first devastat
ing effect, the slow return of coherent
thought might gradually fit him to realise
what there was next to be done.
When h bad come to the boardlrjg
house, high, elated spirits had bidden de
fiance to suspicion or fear, and Hope
had not noted that he was followed at a
guarded distance by a hulking giant of n
fellow who. in turn, was kept in sight by
a wiry, ferret-faced creature evidently of
his own Ilk.
Now, as ho left Claire's recent plao4
of abode, this double cynosure si ill l-'ss
ftttracted Ms attention. Hope was dir
Iy incapable of rogmling, of analyzing
extraneous environment.
As be threaded a lane lined with stunt
ed cedars, the two men came closer to
gether, and then decreased the distance
ns to the unsteady figure in advance cf
them.
When they had come to the most un
frequented and isolated portion of the
winding road, the big fellow halted his
companion abruptly.
"Cut in among the trees," he ordered,
in a hoarse whisper.
"Right, boss!"
"Get abreast or ahead of him."
"And then?"
"Take your cue from me. If I can't
manage him alone"
"You can't ; he's built fo- fight."
"He don't look it just now," muttered
the other.
"Kane warned you: Two do the job,
and make no miss!"
"There tvill be non !" wickedly grin
ned the big fellow.
He showed a lead-ended billy in the
grasp of one hand. This leveled from the
supporting wrist strap, he stole noiseless
ly toward Hope, as h's companion darted
in among the trees.
As a shadow swift and flitting was
thrown across Gideon's path, the natural
instinct of caution, of alert observation,
aroused in him.
He half turned, staring vaguely a
whistling sound cut the air.
Then chug !
He experienced a stinging contact or-r

raurderouslj'.
"You coward!"
"Easy take if again !"
The fellow was a giant in build; stolid
ly confident in his superior weight and
ox-like ponderosity, c threw himself for
ward precipitately for a finishing blow.
How it came about he could not pre
cisely analyze, it was done so quickly, but
in a flash Hope's arms were about bis
own. imprisoning him at the cllows and
rendering the dangling slungsbot ineffec

THE HONEYMOON.
How the Xewly Mrrlerj5Iionld Act
to Avoid Emhnrr.iMsment.
Some thoughtful - advice ns to tho
honeymoon suggest that the selection
of a companion for the trip be made
with can, thus giving to the counsel
:m air of triviality.
Of course, nobody goes on a honey
moon without attention to so obvious
a detail.
The honeymoon is a trying period.
In the first place, misguided friemU
seek to invest the beginning of It with
terror. The rief they throw clings
with telltale pertinacity. The specta
cle of tho hurtling shoe promotes
gaycty.
Then," in their eagerness to nppoar
as a hardened married couple, the pair
are certain to betray themselves. If
sMken to they nre frightened as a
couple of criminals at the service of
a warrant.
At the hotel they are at ouce "spot
ted." The clerk unable :o do this
would never have been a clerk. The
instant recognition of their status is
annoying.
A honeymooning couple should act
naturally. To do'tUs is possible. If
they could only remember that th
mere" fact of marriage was In it√§elf
not remarkable it would help some.
People nre getting married every day.
Some have been known to crowd several
marriages Into a short span of years.
There nre countless precedents for
marriage, it obtains among the best
people. Why so sedulously endeavor to
bring about the conditions of the honey
moon nnd then act us though ashamed
of success?
Let the honeymoon j.alr be brave, If
the admission of being married can be
construed ns bravery, for the fact I
one they cannot conceal. .
They have a way about them. Their
fathers and mothers had a similar way.
So, while the placarding of bassc
with the legend, "Just married and
glad of It," is an extreme not to bi
upheld, it really Is not betrayal of a
secret, for there Is no secret.
The honeymoon Is relatively expen
sive. The wisdom of devoting n year's
income fc It and making up the def
icit by life In a flat may be questioned.
Nevertheless the newly married am
going to have one, and to enjoy it must
forget that they are under surveillance.
If they can. Beyond this they have to
make their own rules.

When fight before her the goblin ap
peared "Greediness robbed you," he said, as he
leered.
The Koy and Margy thought and
thought and thought. Finally they
went to Ylolet Amanda In the kitchen,
for they did not want to let father nnd
mother know. It was to be a surprise.
This Christmas they had planned to
keep the spirit of old St. Nicholas in
their hearts, and there were to be gifts
bought with money of their own earn
ing. How to earn It was the question
Violet Amanda had no suggestions to
ffer, but Kotiert, the hired man, had an
Idea. Now, to look nt Robert you'd
never believe he could have an Idea
stowed away under his black skin and
woolly topknot , but looks are some
times deceiving.
'Out In de nielder," he said, slowly,
88 Violet Amanda poured him a second
cup of coffee, "dey's a pow'ful heap
light ob hlck'ry.nuts on dem big trees,
in' deys mo' in do wood lot. Yo' alls
could git money fo dem' nuts ef dey
wuz gaddered. Dey's Jes ripe fo' fall
In' out do shucks."
'Margy!" cried the noy, "It's Just
the thing. How much could we get for
bushel of 'em, Kobert?"
"I hterd ftomebedy say," said Kob
ert, ns he wiped his mouth on tho back
of his sleeve, "dat yo' could git two
flollahs fo' dem dis Fall up in de city."
"We'll start the minute we've fin
ished breakfast," they cried.
Mother's consent to a nutting party
was given without question. Hags and
baskets were provided, and a lunch of
bread nnd butter, with honey spread
between, and off they started for the
clump of hickory trees In the sheep pas
ture. As they crawled through a hole In
the garden fence they could hear the
trees rustling in a very queer way for
a still day, and pretty soon they espied
somebody la one of the trees, shaking
it vigorously.
"It's a man!" cried Margy, dismayed.
"It's a thief!" shouted the Hoy.
Comj onl" And from far away I.e
yelled : "You thief! Come down out of
cur trees!"
But before they reached the spot the
man swung himself down from the
branches, and behold. It was Robert,
grinning and chuckling.
'I reckoned yo alls couldn't get dose
ruts out de ta lies' tree, so I done shuck
em down foh you."
So their first effort was made easy.
That day's labor showed a line start on
the nut heap, that grew and grew In
the corner of tho garr .
It was not always s.i easy. After the
meadow trees were stripped thoj- had
to hunt In the. woods, and often the
trees were too high for the Boy to
climb.
Other times he and Margy could go
ff
up together and they would both dance
oa the limbs with all their strength,
till the nuts came rattling down in a
Jolly shower.
Som etimes, as the Oetoler days grew
colder, they would come home with
teeth chattering and Gngors and noses
'.lue with cold. Thon mother would
;hnw them out and give them hot lem
onade. And the pile of nuts In the corner of
the garret grew nnd grew.
You inusn't think that picking up tje
nuts was all of the work. Not by any
sort of means. For every nut had a
little green house of Its own ; and al
though sometimes the four little walls
of It fell away at a touch, oftener the
nut gatherers had to try force.
Two stones would do the business
one to poufid on nnd the other to pound
with, ringers and thumbs got pounded,
too, sometimes, and If you want to know
if it hurt or not. Just try pounding your
own finger sometime when It is half
frozen.
But that was part of the affair, and
mother's arnica bottle and salve would
stop the ache and dry the tears. Then,
too, It was very Interesting to unwind
the long, narrow rag and show the
wound to father after supper.
All through the nutting season neither
father iror mother asked one single
troublesome question, so that made it
easy to keefc the secret, although both
Margy nnd the boy were nigh to burst
ing with the importance of It.
And the nut pile. In the corner of the
garret grew and grew.
Every time they added to their hoard
tho whole was carefully measured till
nt last there were three full bushels,
heaped to running over. Uncle Tom
was let Into the secret, and he came
over one day when father nnd mother
were gone and took away the nuts.

Out there, lehlnd the chip pile they
never looked at the black caf, but Uncle
Tom cpened his liand and showed them
six big round silver dollars.
"There's your Christmas money," he
said.
"We'll divide even," said the boy gen

because you worked Just as hard. So
there's three of 'em for each of us."
4 What a Christmas we'll have," cried
Margy rapturously.
"The best ever. It's greit fun doing
tilings ourselves."
And so the sweet kindly spirit of good
old Saint Nicholas lived again, nnd
grew and grew In the hearts of Margy f
and the boy, Just as the nut pile had
grown In the garret.

Chrlstmai Day.
There are no definite allusions In the
writings of any of the disciples of
Christ as to the date of his birth, nor
has tliere ever been produced proof of
any character as to the exact period In
the year when Christ was born. There
are, very true, occasional references to
tho event la the Scriptures, indicating
that the Nativity occurred in" the win
ter, season.
The Institution of the anniversary
dates back to the second century of
Christendom, and it has been since uni
formly celebrated by nearly all the
branches of the Christian church with
appropriate rejoicings and ceremonies.
The frequent and somewhat heated
controversies, however, relative to the
date of Christ's birth early in the
fourth century led Pope Julius I to
order a thorough investigation of the
subject by the learned theologians and
historians of that period, which re
sulted in an agreement upon Dec. 20,
and that decIsVui seemed to have so
settled all disputes that that date was
unlv?rsally accepted except by the
Greek church. While this date was
never changed, the reckoning of it is
made according to the (iregorlan cal
endar, which was adopted in the lat
ter part of the sixteenth century, nnd
upon which computations of time In
nearly all civilized nations have since
rested. American Queen.

The Meniinge.
The President's message is a docu
ment which will be read by a nation of
ninety millions, and will convey to the
collective mind ideas which will fruc
tify widely. It Is, in other words, an
utterance of great moment, which will
have a pervasive and lasting effect
upon the social and-political present
! and future of the republic. President
Roosevelt, as he himself has said, does
not try to compel, but to lead public
j opinion, and his practical statesmau-
fhip has kept him from getting too far
away from those he leads. His mes
sages, and very notably his latest toes
sage, are remarkable expressions of the
newer convictions and aspiratlois of
the American people. They are essays
In practical democracy, formulating the
better purposes aud aspirations of our
people, and leading us on to our next
stage of development. The sophisti
cated aud the cynic may sueer at their
truisms, but in public documents end
as militant expressions of practical po
litical policy these truisms are dynamic
facts to be dealt with.
j The President's reference to the In
compatibility of the Democratic party's
positions on centralization aud on the
trust problem is more specific than ever.
They are "twin denunciations," as he
declares, which nullify each other. It
Is well at this time to have it driven
home, even at the expense of reitera
tion, that centralization in business has
taken place in large measure and must
be met, in so far ns it needs to be con
tiolled in the public interest, by the
central government. It is well also to
have it recognized that combination and
concentration are an Inevitable eco
nomic tendency, to be accepted and tak
en advantage of, not wildly and disas
trously tilted against. It is well
also that certain interests of the nation
which transcend State lines like the
conservation of our great national re
sources must be dealt with by the na
tional government and from the nation
al point of view.
The message also is significant in em
phasizing the importance of a recogni
tion jjy the courts of certain clal facts
to which they are called upor to apply
the enduring principles of our law. The
palpable Injustice and profound social
und political unwisdom of the rulings
against work hour laws on the ground
of preserving the freedom of contract,
nnd the still greater wrong of that in
terpretation of the doctrine of assumed
risk which nu s safety appliauce
laws, and which the sound Judgment
and humanity of the President-elect
brushed aside in the Narramore case-rr
these mistakes of certain of oyr courts
illustrate the legal mind at its narrow
est and accentuate the vital Importance
of a Judiciary which shall be in touch
with the controlling facts of the social
organism and not a mere automatic fol
lower of literal precedent. Chicago

Farmers and the Tariff.
The National Grange will urge upon
Congress the necessity of Immediate
tariff revision, relerring particularly to
those articles that are alleged to be
sold by American manufacturers In for
eign markets at lower prices than In
this country. In this class are said to
be agricultural implements, and nat
urally the farmers object to paying
more for the same article than the Lu
ropean farmer has to pay.
Iiut how about the farmers' own pro
ducts? Are not many of them sohl
cheaper in foreign markets than at
home? Are not the prices on them as a
l nie proportionately higher and better
maintained than the prices of most
manufactured articles? The iron and
steel men have been compelled to re
duce, their price, glass and pottery
have come down, lumber is cheaper, all
except the stuff the farmer produces.
Standard Oil never stood so solidly to
gether on prices as the farmers are do
ing to-day. Of all classes they have the
least to complain of 4n the Industiial
conditions that have prevailed the past
10 or 12 years. In fact, the farmers
have done so well the average city
man's idea of tariff revision Is a kind
that will cause a reduction in the price
of foodstuffs. Wheeling (W. Va.)

Sound Logic.
The' logic of proectlonisin was re
cently enforced with Intelligence and
consistency by the Loudon County
Council, which contains a protectionist
majority. A large contract for steel
rails for the street railways was award
ed to a Itrltlsh firm at a price $10,000
higher than the tender of a Belgian
firm. Of course the free traders were
enraged at this waste of the taxpayers'
money. They Insisted that the rails
ought to have been bought In the cheap
est market. Buf the protectionists re
plied that it was better to spend the
extra 10,(HH) nnd keep British work
men In the rolling mills than to spend
two or three times 510,000 in keeping
them In the workhouse. The answer
should satisfy any sensible man, even
though a free trader.
A Baptlat on D Ivo roe.
Kev. Dr. Spencer B. Meeser, pastor j
of Emmanuel Baptist Churchy Brook
lyn, says of divorce:
"I abhor divorce. It trafiiees n vir
tue. The white robe of the bride ts
the cloak of sin. -Think of it. In one
county In Michigan 410 divorces have
been granted and iu 330 of the eases no
defense was made. Why? Because the
parties to them had beeu guilty of in
fidelity and had no sound defense. Is
not this a lamentable condition? And
a bad thing about It is that the coun
try is as deep in the mire as the city.
"Divorce proceeds from hidden causes
and Is due much to low ideals of the
marriage relation.
"Divorce and remarriage are without
fear of Cod, dangerous to the courts
and the well being of society, and noth
ing but legal polygamy.
"Secondary causes for divorce and re
marriage were silly sentlmentallsra,
seoret marriages and the easy method
of granting marriage licenses.
"All ministers should refuse to
marry any divorced person. That was
one of the best remedies. It would be
better for those who desire divorce to
be bound together for life than that so
ciety and the well being of the State be
destroyed."

"The principles for which our party
stands, the policies for wliich our party
contends, these are not dead."
Such Is the central Idea of Mr. Ary
an's latest proclamation to the Denwc-raej-,
urging it to regard iU recent d
feat as merely "a bati'.o Inst a war
begun," and to enlist for the war.
The question Is, of course. What are
the principles for which the Democ
racy Is to fight on to final victory?
Even Mr. Bryan can hardly expect the
Democracy to fight on for perpetual de
feat. - " "
The extremely 'personal nature of the
recent contest happens to make it
easier to see with what principles, as
embodied In men, the Democracy may
be strong and hope for victory.
They are evidently not the principles
emb5died by Mr. Bryan. They have
been fought for three times under Mr.
Bryan's leadership, and always with
disaster. It Is evident that the country
will have none of Mr. Bryan or of prin
ciples In politics as Interpreted by him.
It is also worthy of note that where
the Democracy showed strength In the
recent contest if was with leaders
whose difference from Mr. Bryan made
them at least seem to embody princi
ples very distinct from Mr. Bryan's.
"The Democratic party must con
tinue its fight or dissolve," further re
marks Mr. Bryan; "It could not exist
as a plutocratic party." Nor could any
party. No such party ever has existed
In this country. The V-'itocratlc par
ty" against which Mr. Bryan is al
ways raising shouts of defiance and ap
peal is like Sairey Gamp's. "Mrs. Har
ris." In the words of Betsy Prig,
"there ain't no sich person."
This Is one of the things that Mr.
Bryan docs not understand and which
it is apparently impossible for him to
understand. And that Is what makes
it Imiossible for the Democratic party
to succeed under such leadership as
Mr. Bryan's with its principles Inter
preted iu the light of such personalities"
as that of Mr. Bryan. '
There Is need in this, as In erery
popular government, of two strong par
ties, either of which can at least be
trusted with the business of govern
ment. And the conditions under which
the Democracy showed real strength Li
the recent contest show what Is the
character of leadership with which it
can inspire trust. -
But, of course4, Mr. Bryan does net
understand. He never will. And the
sooner the Democracy leaves Mr. Bry
an iu a graceful but permanent retire
ment, ns a personally estimable gentle
man w hose political ideas and manners
are not acceptable, the sooner will It
have a reasonable hope of success la

Mr. Carnegie has written an article
