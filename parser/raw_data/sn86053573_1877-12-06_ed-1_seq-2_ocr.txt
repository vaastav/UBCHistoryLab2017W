Tho Baltimore Qwite nrter beslavering
the President with tho most fulsome, and
hypocritical nd til it ton becnne of his
.Southern policy, which has reinstated tho
Democracy in power In tho Southern States,
turns and stings Mm in a most malignant
manner by reminding ldm that ho cannot
tiudo his work if he would, and lidding to
Its hypocrisy the insult: "Let it stand a
fulr monument to the tlmo when public
sentiment compelled even ay usurper to
reverence Its decrees and carry out the Con
stitution!" This treatment is uncItU nnd
cruel, to say the least, bat by anoci.it I rig

delectable party.
A Valuable CJnn.
The men who conspired In Vienna to sell to
a foreign government the secret of the manu
facture of the Uchntlus gun have been sent to
prison for two yean. Tills gun puzzles tho
armorers of tho world, hi lug a pure bmuzc

jectiles as well as Kaurp's steel (tuns, aDd ran
I produced Tor 5175, while the latter cost fW.
Wo clip tho above from the Boston Jour
waf, and its publication calls to mind the
fact that this "Uchatlus gun," as It Is called
in Austria, la no more nor less than the
brouze rilled cannon invented by Mr. Dean,
of thonouth Boston Iron Company, pat
ented In this country In 1869, and In Eng
land, France, and Austria about tho same
time. The Austrian officer, Col. UcilATirs,
must have made diligent use of the specifi
cations accompanying tho application for
tho patent, and the result Is that Austria has
to-day fifteen hundred pieces of the best field
artillery in tho world, as Is acknowledged
by the most competent military authority
In England and Germany.
In our own country not a gun has yet
been made under the "Dean" patent. Gen.
Dyer, we understand, ordered several, but
before tho work commenced the older was
countermanded. Accordingly, up to this
dote, the American inventor can comfort
himself with the suggestion of our blessed
Muster.tluit a "prophet Is not without honor
save in his own country."
FrullM of the Southern roller.
The President In his message spooks con
fidently and with much complacency of tho
prospects that Mthe terrible and often fatal
collisions which for several years have been
of frequent occurrence and have agitated
nnd alarmed the public mind have almost
entirely ceased." In this connection ho
enys: "All danger from remitting these
Btates to local self-government Is dispelled
and most salutary change In the minds of
the people has begun and is in progress In
every part of that section of tho country."
We would that thlssweetsongof peace and
tranquility hod been set to the music of
truth, for then Its notes would be far more
grateful to the ear than they now are when
confronted with the history of passing
events. Now for history, as it comes to us
t from portions "of that section of country."
Wo take the following chapter from the
Jackson (Miss.) Dotty IXmee, of November
80,1877:
About a week "ago, we are 'Informed, P. K.
IIamhett, who resides near Alcorn Univer
sity, shot and wounded one IstiAii Davis, a
colon d man, who was craning his plantation
after having been forbidden to do so Davis
was shot lu the face, and one ear was com
pletely torn from his head. He arose and
said that he had been taken advantage of. and
would see his assailant again.
Tho sumo night tho unfortunate victim,
Davis, was In bed with a colored womau on
tbe Murdoch place, nearby, when a band of
masked men, about a dozen, entered the cabin,
and, taking tho woman from the bed, filled
the body of Davis with bullets, killing htm
almoHt fustautlr.
Davis, realizing the terrible situation of
affairs, and tho utter nonelessntsa of hla eeao.
drew tho sheet over his head aud met death
without resistance.
Tho samo paper at an earlier day has the
following revolting uoto of the Kilutary
change that now marks the brutal polk of
that section of tho country" toward the
colored race. We have no nord lo utter

trite, a paper printed at ltaymond,the Htwto
of this most shocking Atrocity :

for a moment, his hands stretched forward and
his toes touching tho ground. He remilned
nanging ror one ana a nan minutes, wnen ne
gurgled out, "for Owl's sake take mo down
and hang wo over again." He was at last
lifted up, the rope drawn higher, and hod topped
again, lie hung one-half minute longer, when
he again called out, "for Jesus sake hear and
answer me I want to talk." He was taken
looes and placed upon the scanold, when he
said, very disconnectedly : "I-amb of
God, I pray. Friends, I didn't think
you would treat me m. Friends, you
see what an awful death I am dying, and It's
all on account of a woman. Friends, take
warning from tno and never do any thing to
be hung for. I feel willing to dUf but It U
an awful state, and I dread dying as I do."
Rev. Pikrsoh then approach od and asked,
"Walton, do you feel that Jtu is with ) out"
He replied, "I do ; and I pray God that Gkoruk
Banks' soul Is In heaven. Will ou pray and
ting some for roe?'' At twenty minutes to
two another prayer was offered up for the
doomed man, who fonently said amen, and
beggod tbe Lord to hoar his nrayers. At
twenty-one to two he was again lifted on the
trap-door by Deputy BAI k, when ho asked,
"Who Is this?" ''Bkalk," was answered. "Mr.
Bulk." Waltov then said, "I want toask you
oue question before I die. Did any one
ever tell you that I once killed a
man In TcnnemeeT" Mr. BrALM re
plied, "Yew. your wif told me." Walton then
turned to thoso present and said, "Gentlemen,
don't believe It. I gvd you my dying word
that I never killed any man but (JronoH
Banks.' At 141 the trigger was releanedund
Walton, with an unfinished pmcr upon his
lips, was suspended between heaen aud
earth. His hands ere prtvwMl tightly against
his breast. Ids lody motionless. At 1 4 Ji he
began to throw himself around, kicking In the
air, and seemed suffering untold agonies. At
1-45 he quieted, and began slowly drawing
himself and gent fydropplng.h Is hands extended
out. At IdWlDrJ.M.lkMiLBexamloed Ms body
aud pronounced life nearly extinct. At 1 V)
again examined; heart and puis still beating
slowly. At 1-o.i heatt had ceasvd to Wat his
spirit had winged Its flight. He remained
hanging until MM, when the rojns was cut and
he was laced on the ground. The neck
proved to have been broken, and tbe throat
severely cut by the rope, which was a half
Inch one. His body was placed in a coffin
and burled Immediately near tho spot.
The samo paper of November 21, 1877,
ghesthe following note:
The Port Gibson LVrWff, in speaking of the
recent horrible asuaast nation of Jfbomk Yates,
In Hinds Cuunty,eaysi "Jt Isauotlierof the
horrible murders so frequently duplicated In
Mlsitifwlppl, andjf It will cnntinu"eo loug as

court In utter dlvust a fow ilysa,to, becaubo
of tho ident corruption of the Jury."
Wc clip the Hollowing from the same pa
per of November 33, 1877:
The Brookhaten Cornel gies the 'ollowlng
particulars of a most horrible and revolting
crime, aud recommends that tho wretches who
perpetrated tbe deed be turned over to the out
rngd family and tbe neares,to suffer the pen
alty death:
"Wears Informed that a party of young men
In Amite County being the fag-euds of the
late and rapid ly-dlsappea ring bull-dozing ele
ment of that county, but some of them of good
family went into a populous neighborhood on
last Thursday night, forcibly took out a young
negro girl, eighteen years old, from her father's
cabin, and two of them committed upon her the
nameless crime. Her shrieks drew to the scene
many white persons, and several of the lawless
gang were reoogutzed before they could escape.
Warrants, wo learn, are out for the perpetrators
of the shocking crime, and one of them has been
arrested. Our informant declined to give the
names of the criminals, as he wished to avoid
any complicity In the publication of facta. He
says tne outrage nas cast a oars gloom over toe
entire neighborhood where It occurred. Men,
women, and children are shocked and appalled
at Its revolting horror. They speak of It In
subdued whispers, hardly feeling safe In ft
locality wnere sucn a monstrous crime is pos
sible."
Tho President speaks positively as to the
rapid progress that Is being made in the
South under bis policy. He says: There
has been a general re-establishment of or
der and of the orderly administration of
justice," and no doubt thoso who charge his
views aud opinions on these subjects assure
him that tho rweate tints he has imparted
to his annual message are justified by tho
fwts. But he Is blinded as to the real
state $f the case. Tho truth is conceal d
from him, and he Is betrayed Into a false and
unfortunate position. This Is to be deeply
regretted, for we would fain believe that ho
desires to be right; but be never can be
until he gets his light from truthful sources
oilnfonnatlon. The chapters thai we have
cited, and which are of a recent date, are
sufficient to show that there ha not been
a general re-establish men t of order,and of the
orderly administration of Justice" through
out the South. Wo would to Ileaven that
there had been.

nimeof tho BxecutUe to the renomlnatloo of
an officer whovi previous nomination had

After a long and tedious trial Col. Will
xamCraio was on Tuesday acquitted of the
charge of having presented a fraudulent
claim against the Go erament. The ovldence
throughout has shown that It was a case of
persecution and not prosecution, and tho
charge of the Judge 'to the Jury, as given In tho
National Republican of yesterday, was a
complete vindication, the Judge ordering (the
Jury to return a verdict of not guilty. Col.

Turn extreme condition of the Pope natur
ally exoltes anxiety regarding tho selection of
his successor. This anxiety prevails exten
sively outside as well as within tho Bomlsk
Church. Within the church there Is a Jeal
ousy against Italian influence. The over
whelm lag preponderance of that ele
ment In tho Sacred College Is sufficient to
Insure the election of an Italian
successor to Pivs IX. The French, German,
Irish, and Spanish Catholics aro restive under
this continuous Italian rule. Many of them
differed from their coadjutors at the laCe Ecu
menical Council so widely as to threaten dis
ruption of the Church, Those differences are
not yet healed. Meanwhile Borne has lost
that considerable influence which naturally
flowed from the temporal power of the Vati
can. Considering all these facts, It is the
opinion of many that Pivs IX will be the last
of the Popes. It Is believed that immediately
upon the death of Hb Holiness the oonclave
of Italians then present lu the Vatican will as
semble and choose one of their number to be
Pope. But It Is also believed that those pre
lates outside of Italy, who were afforded no op
portunity to take part In the cboioe, will reject
the claimant and ignore the action of the
Italian College as unchristian, uncathollc and
tyrannical. If tho German and Spanish Catho
lics make this stand they will undoubtedly be
sustained by the Irish, English aud
American prelates. In fact, they will
at ouco secure a large majority of the latty of
the Roman Catholic world, and will hoed a
schism that may lead to the purification and
reformation of the church. The death of tho
Pope will be the signal of battle between the
Liberals and the Italians,
