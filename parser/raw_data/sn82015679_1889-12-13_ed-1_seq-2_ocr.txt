MRS. SCOTT LORD'S DEATH.
How It Will Affect the Social Gayetle at the
Capital This Winter.
Special to the Indianapolis Journal ,
Washington, Dec, 12. The death of
Mrs. Lord, the sister of Mrs. Harrison, will,
it is presumed, prevent any social gayeties
at the White Honse this winter, which will
be a great disappointment to the public.
While nothing has been said on the subject
thus far. it is probable that Mrs. .Harrison
will go into mourning. She was very fond
of her sister, and the latter intended to
make her home at the White House, where
she would have been of great assistance to
Mrs, Harrison in her social duties.
While the latter was absent dur
ing the summer,' Mrs. Lord took
entire charge, and the renewal of tho es
tablishment was done under her directions.
The family are in mourning. There will,
of course, do no New Year n reception or
state dinner or receptions, and the White
House family will conduct themselves as
they would under similar circumstances in
private life.
During the first year of Cleveland's ad
ministration the hite House was closed
because of the death of Mr. Hendricks, the
Vice-president, and there have been several
other instances in the past. While the fam
ilies of the Cabinet will not go into mourn
ing, they will show their respect for Mrs.
Harrison by retiring from society for thirty
days, at least, and declining all hospitality
during that time.
Murfal of Mrs. lord's Remains.
Washington', Dec 12. Funeral services
were held over the remains of Mrs. Scott
Lord, at 11 o'clock this morning, at tho

Miller, the President and Mrs. Harrison

The brief and impressive service was fol
lowed by a hymn and at few short prayers,
and the choir led the way from the church
dowu the aisle, singing "Asleep in Jesus,"
followed by the mourners. The remains
were followed to the grave in Kock Creek
Cemetery by about litty carriages bearing
the mourners, the members of the Cabinet,

MINOR MATTERS.
Congressmen Loe No Time In Providing
Means to 1'ay'Tlielr Mileage.
Washington, Dec. 12. The resolution
adopted in the House this aftcrnoou, em
powering Sergeant-at-arms Holmes to ar
range with tho Treasury oiucials to pay the
mileage of members and delegates, was im
mediately engrossed and taken to the de
partment by Mr. Holmes. The officials of
the department immediately proceeded to
the task of drawing checks to the order of
individual members, which will be given to
the Sergeant-at-anns, and by him properly
distributed. Thisj-elievesthat otlicer from
a responsibility in handling the money un
til it can delinitely b determined whether
he is a disbursing officer.
The developments in tho Silcott investi
gation are likely to have tho e fleet of cans,
ing a more rigid crutin to be given at the
Treasury to-all disbursements (or salaries.
It has been tho custom of the auditor of
the District for several months past to col
lect tho salaries of the District employes,
4ttiuin in tho warrant to the Treasury, and
receiving the money in return. By this
method the employes were enabled to re
ceive their salaries in cash, instead of
checks, as had heretofore been the practice.
The employes nearly all preferred payment
iu cash. The method pursued bore great
similitude to that adopted by the Sergeant-at-arms.
The Treasury has now taken a
stand against this method, and has written
the District auditor a sharp - letter, in
which the department announces that it
will no longer countenance this method of
payment
Mexico Declines to Recelre a ConsuL
Washington, Dec. 12. The State De
partment has been informed that the Mexi
can government has refused to grant an
exequatur to Eugene O. FrchTet, of Michi
gan, as United States consul at Hedras
Negras. No reason was assigned, but it is
understood that the refusal to recognize
Mr. Frchlet is owing to some trouble he
was involved in with citizens of Paso del
Norte, where he was consul under the last
administration. The department recog
nizes the right of the Mexican government
to take this course, as it is entirely within
diplomatic practice for a government to
decline to receive consuls who aro not ac
ceptable. -
Nominations and Confirmations.
Washington, Dec. 12. The President to
day sent to the Senate the nomination of
Cyrus 'J. Fry, of South Dakota, to be mar

Washington, Dec. 12. At the earnest
solicitation of his Democratic colleagues.

represented that his action might injure
the party, in view of .the close political
complexion of the House.

Islands An American Prime Minister.
Pout land, Dec. 12. Capt. William
Goodwin, ot the bark . Tewkesbury L.
Sweat, which was wrecked on the Caroline
islands last April, arrivedo-day from San
Francisco. He tells a thrilling story of the
wreck. The cidw lived for seven months
among savages and navigated 1,000 miles
in boats aud canoes nntiL they reached
Ponopo, whence the ship Morning. Star
took them to Honolulu: on going there thev
came to San Francisco. The savages were
jiot hostile. The shipwrecked crew found
an American named Charles Irons, English
by birth, who was left on Pozeat island
four years ago by a trading vessel, lie is
now living in a savage state, having seven
wives, and being Prime Minister of the
island. - It was through the good offices of

Cincinnati, Dec. 12. Assistant Cashier
Riegel. of tho Metropolitan National Hank.
wasonthe stand in theMeans-DeCamp trial,
to-ttay, testily ing tor the defense, lne
drift of his testimonywas opposed to that
of Cashier Edwards. Kiegel says he knetv
very. well that Means had a fictitious credit
of a deposit of 8200,000 at the time the bank
examined called. He had made theentrv
himself )ii Dec. 13, and Means had asked
htm.to date it back to Nov. 20. Mr. DeCainn
also testified to-day. He said the directors
borrowed money from the bank to take up
toe increased stocK, ana that they acted iu
good faith to save the credit of tho bank.
He said that the falsiiication of the books
was advised by Cashier Edwards. This is a
direct contradiction of Edwards, who
charged DeCamp with suggesting that the
books bo "fixed." Mr. Means is still absent
and is reported to be growing worse and
worse mentally.
Sugar Swindlers Derive No Benefit.
Kansas City, Dec. 12. The great sugar
swindle, planned by the American Sugar
Company, of Kansas, has entirely collapsed.
and the townships which voted bonds to
foster the industry will lose nothing. All
the bonds. 90.000 in amount, voted in
Meade county for the extension of the
Meade Center mills, nave been canceled.
and the scrip issued by various townships
in Clark county has been destroyed, except
ing 15,000 voted by one township, and this
cannot now be negotiated, owing to the
publicity given to tho swindle. The sugar
company's scheme was a gigantic one. and
if it had been successfully executed a mill
ion dollars would not have covered the loss
sustained by tho counties and townships
where the company contemplated organiza
tions.

OBITCAKK.
Robert Browning, Bent Known and Least Un
derstood of Modern English Poets.
Lonion. Dec. 12. A dispatch just re
ceived from Venice brings the information
that Kobert Browning, tho poet, died at 10
o'clock to-night, without any suffering.
During the-dav he expressed himself as
sansneu wiin xue success ui uia now vol
ume of poems.
Robert Browning, upon whom it was gen
erally believed the distinction of Poet
Laureate would fall at Tennyson's death,
was born at Camberwell, England,
May 7, 1812, and was the son of a Lon
don tradesman. After receiving a gram
mar-school education he attended lectures
and traveled abroad. Even in his extreme
youth he acquired a reputation as a writer
of verse, and at the age of nineteen pub
lished "Pauline," an ambitious dramatic
poem. Two years later, in liv', appeared
'Parcellusy a poem of greater strength.
His first tragedy, "Stratford," appeared in
1837, but was unpoonlar. Three years later
came the famous "Sardello," most subtle
and intangible ofj all his works. During
the next six vears he issued a series of
plays and dramatic lyrics, which were later
collected and published under the title of
Hells and romegranates." Among them
were the most popular of his lyrics, "The
Pied Piper of Hamelin." and "How They
Ilroueht the News to Aix." In 1846 he mar
ried Elizabeth Barrett, who acquired poet
ical fame as Mrs. Browning. His "Christ
mas Eve and Easter Day" poems were pub
lished, and in lo.v "Men and- women."
After the death of his wife, in 1SC1, he set
tled permanently in London, and has since
published over twentv volumes, among
which was his general fy accepted master
piece. "The King and The Book."
unquestionably urowmngi nas naa a
wider influence during the past decade
than any living English poet.' Throughout
England and the United States, Browning
clubs and societies have encouraged and
developed public interest in his works.
I hough lennyson has stood nominally at
the head of the English poets, the fascinat-
ingmysticism and keen psychological pur-
ose of Browning's more elaborate works
ave gained for him a wider and more en
thusiastic circle of admirers.
In anoearanc and manner there was
nothing of the poet or sentimentalist about
Browning. He was a man ff robust phy- i
sioue. heartv croud nature, rather brusnne
and bnsiness-iike in his Hpeech, and a frank
and charming conversationalist. He usu
ally dressed in a plain, well-made cutaway
suit and plug or derby hat. and wore a
close-cropped beard and epoctacles.

Burned with Scalding Steam.
Milwaukee, Dec. 12. A serious accident
occurred at the uew Northwestern depot
last evening, just after its opening. The

the steam rushed out. William Winter,
the engineer, was knocked to the floor ana
terribly scalded. He managed, however,
to crawl out and save his life. In an ad
joining room, which was tilled with dyna
mos, were two electricians L. A. Carr and
T. W. Case, and Herman Boetcher, a ma-!
chinist. Carr aud Case were terribly;
burned, and it is feared both inhaled the!
scalding steam. Boetcher was almost pros-,
tratea. instead ot crawling out no arose
aud attempted to rush out of the chamber.

the surroundings, he fell down repeatCCiTy.

having been scalded about the face and
hands, and having swallowed a great deal
of steam. At the nospital it was said his

..PUTTING IN ONi: FOK GOKDOS."
IIow Beautiful Democratic Majorities are
Rolled Up In Georgia.
Atlanta Constitution.
Here is a recollection of Governor Gor
don's lirst gubernatorial campaign; "It
was in INis," goes the story, as told by Mr.
G. W. Richards, superintendent of . tho
water-works.' "Gordon was making the
race against Bullock. Iwas running tho
way freight on the Macon & Western road
inow tho Central) from Macon to Atlanta.
)n the day of the election we left Macon at
5:o0 in the morning and arrived at Bolmg
broke, then called Crawford's station, jiwt
about the time tho polls opened. At that
time mil the' engines were burning wood,
and the crow consisted of engineer, lireman
and wood-paRser. The wood-passer also
attended to the brake on tho tender, which, '
with the brake in tho conductor's caboose,
was all that were then used on freight
trains. My wood-passer was not of age,
but my fireman had served through the war,
most of the. time under General Gordon,
and. of course, was going to vote for him.
His home was in Macon, and he asked me
if he could not vote for Governor elsewhero
than at home. I told him that I thought
he could vote anywhere in the State for
Governor.
' Then I believe 1 will just go over there
and put in one for Gordon said he, as wo
slowed up on the siding.
"He had ample time, as way-freights usu
, ally had from twenty minutes to an hour
at the principal stations. Ho accordingly
put in his vote for Gordon. Leaving Craw
ford's we next stopped at Forsyth. Tho
Eolls were some distance from the depot,
ut the schedule gave ample time to go a
mile and return; so, when wo tame to a
standstill, he remarked that he would just
run up and put in one for Gordon. Of
course I didn't object. The next place wan
Barncsville. Here we ate breakfast, aud
as he did not get back to the engine with
tho rest of us, when ho came I asked him
where he had been.
"'I've just btenup putting in one forGor
don.' was the answer.
"The next station of importance was Gi if
fiu, and here we had about an hour. This
was the place from which ho had volun
teered, and he was well known; so he got
with some of his old comrades and went U
tho polls to 'put in one lor Gordon.1 Ther
was no station at which the schedule gavo
mnch time until we arrived at Jonesboro.
Here we ate dinner. The dinner-house was
kept'by a Mrs. Johnson, some distance from
the depot, and in pacing the polls after
dinner, ho found no trouble iu pufxing in
one for Gordon.' Wo arrived iu Atlanta
on time, and put our train away, and got
in the round-houso before sundown. Tho
fireman washed up, and hunied off to tho
court-house to 'put in one for Gordon.' Ho
is now an engineer, and has been with mo
ever since that time, and it would be hard
to tell of whom ho thinks the most, moor
General Gordon."
A Greenback View of the Message.,
Indianapo'.U Leaner. '
President Harrison's first message on tha
silver question shows that he is in favor of
that .metal as a part of our money circula
tion. In this his views are diametrically
opposed to those of Clevelind. While tho
President expresses some doubt as to tho
. ett'ectof a free coinage law, he sa3's: "1 havo
always been an advocate ol the use ot silver
in our currency. We are large producers
of that metal, and we should not discredit
iU" It is evident that the trusts did not
inspire tho President's message concerning,
tho-e institutions It it also quite clear ,
that those railroad magnates, who brutally
assert that human life and limb are cheaper
than the appliances that would reduco
dangers to the minimum, did not dictato
that part that recommends legislation for
the protection of employes.
Tho YVindotn Silver Plan.
Minneapolis Tribune.
The Milwaukee Sentinel says that
"Bland, tho author of the prcnent silver
dollar, doesn't like tho Windom silver
scheme because it makes gold the real
standard. Mr. Bland or Congress will
never be able to make anything elo the
standard. Silver is as good as gold under
the Windom plan, and that is all that cau
ever be mado of it." Our contemporarv U
not quite right. Congress, under Mr.
Bland s leadership, might makenilver tho
exclusive standard of this country, driving
gold out of circulation and Meiicanizmg
or Peruiianizing our monetary stem.
But Mr. Windom's plan of tying tho metal
together will ba safer and wiser.
