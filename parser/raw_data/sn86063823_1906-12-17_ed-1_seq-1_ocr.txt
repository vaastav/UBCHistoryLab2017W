TIGATE CAR SHORTAGE
The Fuel Situation Serious in North Dakota and
Montana.
RAILROAD TRY
Cattle Raisers Present a
ing That Appalling Conditions7 Exist, and Inter
state Commerce Commission is Thor
oughly Aroused Over the Question
of Car Shortage.
Washington, Dec. . 17. In present
ing to the senate today a memorial
from the cattle raisers of the Western
States, Senator Culberson said the
cattle raisers were suffering more
extensive damage at this time from
shortage of cars and bad service from
transportation companies than from
disease of cattle, limited - markets
and all other causes combined. He
expressed the hope that the memo
rial would receive speedy considera
tion looking to relief.
RAILROADS TRY TO "
- SHIFT THE BLAME.
. Washington, Dec. 17. In response
to telegrams of inquiry addressed to
several western railroads by the In
terstate Commerce Commission as to
the cause of the reported shortage of
cars for the transportation of fuel
by reason of which suffering is en
tailed, President Howard Elliott of
the Northern Pacific, telegraphs the
Commission from St. Paul that while
there is a shortage of coal in some
parts of the country along his line,
he does not know of any shortage in
other necessities of life. He stated
that he did not think the cause of
car shortage was caused by extraor
dinary delay in moving coal as al
leged, but rather due to increased do
mestic trade, and that in Montana and
Idaho not enough coal had been min
ed to supply the increase. In North
Dakota and Minnesota he said the
difficulty was partly due to trying to
move too much fuel in a very short
time, and partly to an increased con
sumption of fuel that is greater than
the facilities for hauling, moving and
storing. The severe weather in North
Dakota also has caused some delay.
!
FUEL SITUATION j
SERIOUS IN DAKOTA.
St. Paul, Minn., Dec. 1?. A special
from Grand Forks, N. D-i, says: "The
fuel situation today presents the most
critical condition in the history of
the state. Careful inquiry in every
portion of the northern half of the
state shows that there is not a town
in which coal can be had except in
small quantities to supply immed
iate needs, and in a dozen places -not
a pound is to be bought, the dealers
having been out for days, and in some
instances for a week or more.
Linton, N. D., Dec. 17. Excepting
a little anthracite, which cannot, be
used in most cook stoves and many
heaters, there is no coal here and no
signs of bettering the condition.
There is plenty of lignite at Bis mark,
but it cannot be gotten here.
-
An Appalling Condition.
Washington, D. C, Dec. 13. Com
plaints filed by shippers throughout
the southwest ami Northwest indicate
in the language of Mr. Prouty of the
interstate commerce commission "a
condition that is appalling." Presi
dent Roosevelt has been ma.de famil
iar with conditions and if the inquiry
which will be made by the interstate
commerce commission confirms the
reDorts made by the shippers, the
whole subject will be submitted to
Congress with recommendations and
observations by the Executive.
It is alleged that in Texas, Oklaho
ma and the Indian Territory thous
ands of cattle are being turned loose
on the prairies because the railroads
rpfiifip tn siinniv ears. In the North
f west - grain is rotting alongside the
' tracks. .- For the Northwestern terri
tory the commission will hold public
! sessions or Inquiry at Minneapolis and
Chicago, beginning December 17 at
Minneapolis and probably concluding
at Ofiicago December 21.

TO SHIFT BLAME
Memorial to Congress Stat
sioner Harlan have been designated
to make the Northwestern inquiry.
Commissioner Prouty will inquire in
to the conditions in Texas, Oklahoma
and the Indian Territory, beginning
his hearings at St. Louis December
18, and later at Kansas City, conclud
ig December 20.
The iterstate commerce commission
is thoroughly aroused over the ques
tion of car shortage. Its investiga
tions will be general as well as local
Reports of -car shortage have been
received from every part of the coun
try. "Reports are pouring in to the com
mission" said Mr. Prouty, to-night,
"indicate conditions that are appalling
Thousands of head of live stock are
being turned loose on the prairies in
Texas because the railroads refuse to
accept them for transportation. In
Indian territory and Oklahoma con
ditions are declared to be so bad
that it is impossible to ship a car of
grain or other material into Texas.
"The railroads refuse absolutely to
receive it, declaring they cannot han
dle the traffic. In the great North
west grain states wheat and other
grain is lying alongside the tracks
exposed to the weather because it is
impossible to get cars for its trans
portation to the elevators and mark
ets. On the Pacific coast lumber is
declared to be rotting in the woods
because the railroads refuse to haul
it.
A Tremendous Problem He Says.
"In short, the situation is the most
acute now confronting the country. It
is a tremendous problem. Our inves
tigation will cover both sides of the
question. We will hear 'both the ship
pers and the carriers. We want to
know directly from the shippers about
conditions and we want to know from
the railroads the causes which make
possible the complaints which are
reaching us.
"The commission also will inquire
into the ability of freight car manu
facturers to turn out rolling stock.
It has been asserted by many railroad
men that they found it impossible to
have sufficient cars built, i We want
to know whether this is true and why
"At the St. Louis and Kansas City
hearings I expect shippers from Tex
as, Indian Territory, Oklahoma and
the Southwest generally will be heard
Just who will be called upon to testi
fy at the hearing we cannot say at
present." '
People Suffer for Fuel.
A phase of the car shortage prob
lem even more serious than any so
far mentioned, was revealed in infor
mation placed in the hands of the
President to-day that people are freez
:ng to-death in North Dakota and else
where in the Northwest because the
railroads are not supplying enough
cars to haul necessary fuel. It is ev
en declared that railrois have been
confiscating coal for their own pur
ooses, thus depriving the people. Hun
dreds of persons have been caught
without fuel in the exj-emely cold
weather of the past few weeks. Coal
and other fuel is unobtainable at any
price in some instances.
o
TWO MESSAGES FROM
PRESIDENT ROOSEVELT.
Washington, Dec. 17. The Presl
dent sent a message to congress to-
day on the "public land laws, in which
he said there was need of vigorous
and immediate action to recast the
public land laws. He said that he was
gravely concerned about the extreme
ly unsatisfactory conditions of the
public land laws and at toe preva
lence . of fraud under present condi
tions. He said that for much of this
fraud the present laws were chiefly
responsible. "There is but one way
to stop these frauds," he continued,
"and therefore .1 have directed the
Secretary of the Interior to allow no
patents to be issued to public lands
under any law until by examination
on the ground actual compliance with
the law has been found to exist." Be
sides frauds, the President touched
on the report of the Secretary on the
matter of privileges and private hold
ings within national forest reserves
and National parks and the govern
ment control of grazing lands.
The two messages -from the Presi
dent were received by congress with
great interest, but the Panama mes
sage received the greatest . attention.
It was elaborately illustrated, show
ing the work on the great waterway
in various stages, and was in the
form of a very entertaining story of
the President's visit. Handsomely
bound copies were laid on ' the desks
of members as the reading of the
message began. ,
