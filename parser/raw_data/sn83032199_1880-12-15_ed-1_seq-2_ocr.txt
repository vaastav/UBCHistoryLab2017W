It is reported that Judgo Strong, oi
the United States Supremo Court, is
about to resign his place on tho Bench
and take the Chief Attorneyship for
the Reading Railroad at double tho sal
ary he is now receiving. He was put
on tho Bench by monopolists and he has

never bothered him.

A Wholiso.mx Remark. The late
Governor of Indiana, "Bluo Jeans"
Willlams,hclicvcd emphatically in econ
omy. When applied to once, to aid
some charitable cause, he said to the
ladies who asked it : "If you will dis
pose of your jewelry and fine clothes
and give tho proceeds to this object,
and dress ns plainly as my wile, you
would not need to solicit aid."
"Down ok the XiontR," Too! Tho
late election returns indicate that thcro
are a great many Radicals in Iowa who
apparently are not in favor of admi
ting colored men to the Legislature.
The majority for the constitution!
amendment making colored men cligi
bio was less than forty thousand,
while Garfield bad a majority nt pear
ly eighty thousand.
The "New Probabilities." Gen
W. B. Ilazen has been appointed Sig
nal Officer, vice Gen. Moyer, hotter
known as"Old Probabilities," deceased
Me has no special fitness lor the posi
tion, and owes his appointment to
political influonoo. llazen will
known as "Old Probs" hereafter, pro
vided the appointment is satisfactory
to tbe Senate. About bis only qualifl
cation for tbe office is tho fact that he
is an Ohio man.
Well Baouaoeo. An exchange
says that "Mrs. President Lincoln re
cently returned from Europe with
wardrobe represented by sixty-five
trunka, which wore forwarded from
New York to SpringSold, Illinois, at
cost of 1 100 oxprossaga." I has al
ways boon said that "the late lamented'
died poor, and that his family was near
poverty 'a door. If tbe abovo "sixty-
five trunks" be true, who is lying about
"the Government" family ?
now weSwino Around. Tho ncz
United Statos Senato will be prosided
over by Chester A. Arthur, the Vice
President-elect, who was turned out of
the New York Custom House by Sec
retary Sherman for corrupt practices
in the discharge of his ofliciul duties
Suppose Sherman be elected United
Statos Senator from Ohio, what
spectacle it will be to see him a mem
bor of lbs body presided over by
Arthur. Did Hayes and Shorman lio

Presidential Election Dat. The
Cincinnati Mar remarks : "Jnst why
tbe Tuesday next after tbe first Mon
day in tho month was selected instoad
of the first Taosday we never heard
explained but once, and that explana
tion waa that if the first Tuesday had
been named it might have fallen on

that much work ia done in the Com

over the gravo of John W. Geary, who
with Auditor General Hartranft and
State Treasurer William H. Kemble,
conspired with ono Georgo O. Evans, a
Philadelphia "rooster," whom tho trio
jointly labeled "Agent lor the Common

collect f. $:100,00 War claim duo Penn

to them by tho Federal Government,
bnl not ono dollar of it ever reached
tho Stato Treasury. Tbe money was
divided among the conspirators. Not
withstanding Ibis bold robbery on the
part of Geary and his confederates, tho
"Grand Moral Idea" Legislature ap
propriated t.),000 toward erecting

honest men and rogues in this high-
toned Commonwealth. Roadcr, which
grave would you prefer to honor?

Geary's, at Harrisburg.
Too Hi de. We like the editor of
tho Solingsgrove TYmr-o-forhis unflineh
ing Domocracy ; but sometimes ho sees
fit to trespass, by unnecessarily assail
ing some of our mutual party friends.
Here is bis last on Judge Black :
It ll hoped Judge Black hat permanently re
tirad from tbe buiineea of mending tha amlrebed
reputuationa ar Redieal polilioiane. The Garfield
job waa a atunner on tbe old Judge. There ll
till aa unexplained myatory about It, and we
eant't get away from aa iatattivo tmpreaetea that
tha Judge tried to fti up Oarfteld'e ruputalion for
a ooaeiueraiion ae a pruteoaionu eorvioe. Here
after tha old man bad batter keep out uf each jobi
una cava nimaall Irooa nnplaaaaut refleettaae.
Now, if the grand old Roman did
become tajiglod in defending his broth
er, Garfield, ho made the blunder on tbo
right side because of personal friend
ship. Garnold is the sinner in the caso,
and not Judge Black. Tho Judge, of
course, likes a good fee; but when a
personal friond thrusts it upon his
hands, fees are never thought of.
Should be MoreCareeul. The noxt
time that the man who drawa the
Presidential salary, or of the Secretary
of tbo Treasury, writes a letter to a
Government oflicial be should revise, it
before it goes into the publio prints.
That lottor from Hayes to Arthur,
while tho latter was Collector of Cus
toms at New York, "I fool it my duty
to dismiss you that the office may be
HONESTLY administered," will rise
up to plague him if he overshotild moot
Arthur as Vice Prosidont of bis politi
cal party. Roadcr, remember that
tli roe years ago Mr. Hayes und bis
Secretary ol the Treasury pronounced
Arthur, tho Vico Presidentelect, a

to lio between Gov. Jloyt and Galusba
A. Grow. Mr. Cameron's luvorito,
Henry W. Oliver, of Pittsburgh, has
dropped out ol the race. John Cessna
heads a small banil of devoted follow
ers, and .1, K. Mtirubeuil is also in tbo
field. Thu leading supporters ol Mr.
(irow claim that filVy fivo Senators and
Members have been instructed for biui,
and thut this ascertained and positive
strength is rapidly increasing and will
certainly control the Republican caucus.
But lo Ihoso lumiliar with the history
oi former assault upon the Cameron
citadel in the Legislature, it looks like
tho old, old story. Admitting tbe
claims of tho Grow leadont of fifty-five
instructed votoa In the caucus, they
still luck twenty-throe of a majority.
i hen Thaddous Stovcna and Andrew
G. Curtin once on a timo entered tho
lists ugainst Cameron they were able
to muster a majority of instructed and
pledged members of the caucus: but
when the decisive moment came theii
seemingly invincible strength melted
awoy before tho peculiar tactics of
their adversary. Now Thaddous Ste
vens and Andrew G. Curtin, whon
they were candidates for the United
States Senatorship, bad a greater fol
lowing in the Republican party than
Mr. Grow has to day, but still with all
their power they wore unublo to bold
intact tho apparent anti C'amoron ma
jority in the Legislature. How then
can Mr. Grow expect to do better than
those abler politicians who with greater
advantages of position thun ho pos
sesses, failed in their attempt to cap
ture the Cameron stronghold 1
The interests of tho Democratic
party, it must be admitted, would prob
ably be subserved by the election of
Mr. Grow. He cannot have ontiroly
forgotten or discarded his former Dem
ocratic and liberal principles. Hie
views on the tariff are undoubtedly
moderate and bis sectionalism is a
more pretense to. which he felt himself
obliged to rosort in ordor to carry
favor with tbe stalwarts. Ho bas
turned bis political coat twice already,
and who knows but he might gel it
on with tho seamy side turned tho
right way should ho onco bo soatcd in
tho Senato? Besides Mr. Grow is not
a man who is likoly to play socond
fiddle to Mr. Cameron, or to mako any
alliance by which the latter would bo
enabled to retain his present control
of oflicial patronage. The rival houses
of Cameron and Grow would divido
tbe once huppy Republican family into
hoelile factions, and tho power which
has so corruptly and yet so absolutely
ruled in tho politics ol Pennsylvania
would be endangered if not broken. We
confess, therefore, that since tho elec
tion of a Republican to the United
States Senato seoms inevitable we shall
not bo griovod beyond consolation if
the choice of tho Republican caucus
shall fall upon Galusha A. Grow.

An effort ia being roudo before the

The local papors slate that tbe object
ia to have the Court declared unconsti

convictod of arson somo two years ago
and for whom a pardon could not be

for a writ ol quo warranto; which was

As things go, it is not likely tbat a
Senator will be elected who will make
any approach to Senator Wallace in
point ol ability and energy. The Re
publicans of this Commonwealth fre
quently pass by the most meritorious
and select men, instead of tbe least
worthy, for high office; and tbo same
rulo may apply in this case. In that
event tho mantle of Senator Wallace
will not fall upon Colonel Snowden ;
for be is the equal in most respects and
superior in othora to any yet named in
connection with tbo Senatorship.

THE MOREY LETTER.
As tho shamming over the Moiey
letter govs on we are more and more
convinced of its genuineness, that the
body of tbo lettor was written by
Brown, Garfield's clerk and signed, by
the C. M. statesman himself. It is so
characteristic of (Jar Hold to mako oath
that ho did not write the lottor, it hav
ing been written by his clerk I The
man who circulated a counterfeited
and intorpolatod copy of the Poland
report (tho satno which lod tho Musca-
tino Journal astray) is capablo of Just
that sort of moral though not techni
cal porjury. Every fact in Garfield's
life relating to a pinch in his fortunes
condemns him of this tricky oath.
Whon a question aroso as to tho ordor
in which his back pay was covered
into the Treasury, hr,in a publio speech
exhibited a list of tho members who
had returned the salary grab, printed
in the Now York Hrrtild, and said to
his audience, "there bas boon some con
troversy as to the order in which my
back pay wag returned. You will ob
serve that in this llirald list my name
ia tho first."
Now that was true, hut it was a lie.
His name did bead tbe Herald list, but
instead of being the first to return bis
back pay ho was tho twenty -seventh.
It is this miserable untruthltilness,
this lying and sneaking disposition of
Garfield, that appals all thinking men
who value public morality. Every
such man and evory gontlcman can
appreciate this paragraph in A brain S.
Hewitt's lato article in tbo Nation on
the Moroy letter. Replying to tbo Ju
dicial coward Noah Davis's charge
that Hewitt and Garfield woro"fricnds,
air. Hewitt says : "lhoro was an m
suporable bar to the formation of any
friendship botween us from tbe outset,
and this bar never was, nor by any
possibility ever could havo boon ro
moved. Gen. Garfield never crossed
my threshold nor did I over enter bis
door."
Of no other man ever elected Presi
dent of this Republic could a thing as
true and severe have been said. M
Hewitt ia a gentleman, careful of bis
associations and Gurfiold bad just been
convicted of bribery and perjury by

of said counties the robbery of stores,

were traced to the infamous crowd
known as the "Welsh mountain gang."

GRANT FOR THE SENATE.
The rumor that Gonerul Grant is to
be elected to tho Senate to renroscnt
New York is closely followed by the
rumor tbat be is to bo elected to rep
resent Pennsylvania.
Both statements ate nlausiblo on
thoir faco.1
Grant is eligible. For the last twelve
yoars ho bos had no permanont resi
dence, and can as easily claim citixen
shipiiieilherono of the States mention
cd as in Illinois, from which Common
wealth ho hailed when elected Presi
dent. Ho is invincible. Conkling con
trols tho New York Legislature, Cam
eron tho Legislature of Pennsylvania.
Kach has tho power to make the ox
President a Senatorial colleague.
Tho difficulty lies in tho fact thut
(rant cannot sit for New York and
Pennsylvania at the samo lime. Ho
may bo elected Senator by both Stutcs,
but, being so electod, ho must make a
choico as to which he will serve. A
question of rivalry arising at this time
oeiwecn t.onkiingandt.'amcron,would,
also, be awkward. They are both for
Grant and the F.mpiro.
It is our Christian hope, how
ever, that Grant will bo elected to the
Senate, from somo Stato or other. Wo
witnt tho American people to find out,
beloro he dies, of what metal their
ridiculous idol is made Exchange.
