With Bryan as the most prominent
character outside of official life in
Washington at the opening of congress
and with the retention of John Sharp
Williams, who lias recently come out
for Bryan's renonilnation for the pres
idency, the democrats aided bv the
able generalship of Senator Charles A.
Culberson on the Hoor or the upper
house, are entering upon a career that
promises much at the outset of a na
tional campaign year.
,A press dispatch was received at
this office yesterday stating that Gov
ernor Deneen has been dickering
with Governor Hughes to deliver the
Illinois presidential delegation to the
latter if Deneen can connect with the
nomination for vice president. The
dispatch states further that Deneen
is opposing the Cannon boom, and
for that reason is insisting on a pri
mary, bill containing a provision for
the popular vote on presidential can
didates through the selection of dele
gates to the national convention.
The ltooKevoltian Message.
The message of President Theodore
RontU'Vt'lt rp.id in th( first sptminn nf
the Grtth congress today is one of the
most voluminous documents ever sub
mitted by a nation's chief to that dis
tinguished body, and yet it embodies
nothing particularly striking in sug
gestion or recommendation that has
not been contained in former messages
submitted by the present executive.
U is strictly Rooseveltian in character
being vigorous in tone and employing
the simplest language, launching into
the discussion of national problems
and questions at the very outset with
"out wordy Introduction and concluding
abruptly without perroration or review.
The president holds that the repub
lic is fuM.iamentally sound, although
serious differences exist on matters of
national policy that have bred sore
spots. He stands for frankness in
dealing with national and international
questions, maintaining that dishoisty
must be eliminated even though the
innocent suffer; advocates numerous
forms of remedial legislation, relative
to currency, chief of which is more
elasticity; reiterates his denunciation
of trusts and monopolies but does not
exactly open the way to effectually
abolish them.
The Inheritance and income tax rec
omniendations are among the strong
est propositions that afe presented in
the : message. President Roosevelt
takes a positive stand for the proper
development and maintainance of in
land waterways, in which connection
the deep water proposition as it ap
plies to the Mississippi receives hon
orable mention. - He makes plea for a
larger navy, and while he responds to
the appeal of the publishers of the
United States for . the repeal of the
wood pulp duty as the only basis of
relief from the oppressions of the rob
ber paper trust, "and makes the proper
recommendations relating to the same,
he stands pat on the evil that is at
the bottom " of all trust organization
and holds that the tariff should not be
disturbed until after the presidential
election. t'
The White House lottery.
. St. Louis Republic: ' The White
house ' jiu-jitsu 'exercises havln
passed -Into history along witn
the lowavprize fight which was pulled
off under the refined and euphemistic
name of a boxing match," we have
a new sensation involving the ques
. tlon whether' the president of the
United States is the only man in the
United States who can conduct a lot
tciy without getting .himself indicted
by a federal grand jury.
The property which President
Roosevelt disposed of to the tvo
jealous senators from South Dakota Is
highly valuable. The government' of
the United States pays large sums of
money annually- for its maintenance.
It seems to be up to the prosecuting
attorney of the District of Columbia tb-j
make up his mind whether in awarding
It by the flip-of a coin and the draw
ing of the long slip and the short slip
the president has violated the federal
law which unmistakably forbids that
sort of thing to the ordinary citizen.
For the president it was the easy
way out of an embarrassing situation.
But the easy way is not always the
lawful way. All parties engaged in the
gamble are satisfied except-' Senator
Gamble, who did not live up to his
name, since Senator Klttredge had the
best of the luck and got the juiciest
of the patronage plums dealt out to
South Dakota.
But so eminent an authority on eth
ics and law as the president poses to
be ought to question his conscience
closely as to whether In choosing the
easy way in this instance he has not
violated both moral and statutory law.
If the senators would quarrel over the
patronage, would it not have been bet
ter to have required.them to call in the
governor or the chief justice of the
South Dakota supreme court to act
with them as a committee of arbitra
tion and award?
These considerations are passed
along to the president, to the authori
ties of the district of Columbia and to
the senate and- house committees on
the district Li t us have an authori
tative decision' as to whether it is law
ful to dispose of federal patronage by
lottery while similar disposal of less
valuable property is forbidden and the
law forbidding it is vigilantly enforced.
I'orce of Demorralyr l'lim-iplcs.
Mr. Bryan's drawing of the line be
tween the points in which President
Roosevelt has shown ome sort of re
mote resemblance to a democrat and
those in which he differs widely from
a democrat only emphasizes the fact
that the people or this country are
true to time-honored democratic prin
ciples.
in order to keep tneir party in
power, after it had been put m by
Mark Hanna. both President McKin
ley and President Roosevelt found it
necessary to adopt a number of the
cardinal policies of the democracy
President McKinley led with his policy
of obliterating civil war sectionalism,
for which the democratic party had
always contended. '
President Roosevelt saw at an early
date that if the republican party did
unt curb some of the great monopolies
that had grown up under its fostering
care, that task would be delegated to
the democratic organization. That
was as evident as anything iu Amer
ican politics cquld be.
But, with the exception that he has
stolen a few bolts of democratic thun
der. President Roosevelt is by nature
and by habits of thought the most un
democratic of all the 25 men who have
served in the presidency.
His rash and impetuous assumption
of autocratic power far surpasses any
thing that was charged in this line
against the most harshly criticised of
his predecessors.
His contempt for tlie constitution
his assaults upon the rights of the
states and his novel doctrines of con
stitutional interpretation would have
been deemedJittle short of treasonable
by any earlier generation.
In all this there is not a- trace of the
code of principles which make up the
democratic creed. President Roosevelt
has in him not a pinch of the leaven
of democracy. He has shown himself
only a clever opportunist who has
taken up a democratic idea or two to
serve his rad'oal republicanism.

Probably many a brutal husband
who reads these lines will sigh and
suv. "Ah. that my wife were a Ko
rean!" There has an impression got
abroad i:i tills laud of the free aud the
home of the grafter that our women
are endless aud tiresome talkers. . In
the eyes of the masses the American
wife holds the long distance record as
a continuous conversationalist. And
upon this impression jests and Jokelets
are freely built.- The eternally talking
wife Is a prolific source of Inspiration
for comic veeklies and the vaudeville

CENSUS HUMORS.
Returns of Occupations That Are Dif
ficult to Classify.
According to an official of the census
bureau at Washington, that organiza
tion Is often puzzled to know bow to
classify the returns of occupation In
oases- where the enumerators nave
:iven a too literal description of a
person's employment. There are two
census terms to cover such cases. Oc
cupations not included in the regular
list may be entered as "O. T.." mean
ing "other things," or "X. G.," which
stands for "not gainful." To choose
between the two sometimes suggests
amusing complications.
An enumerator in Iowa reported
"drunkard" as the occupation of one
of his men. The census bureau en
tered him as "N. G.." since the next
column asserted this to be his occupa
tion for twelve months in the year.
A New . York enumerator who
seemed to evince the inclinations of a
detective reported several men iu his
district' as "crooks." "pickpockets"
and "gamblers." They were entered
as "X. G.." although their occupations
may have been more gainful to them
than to their victims.
An Alabama man whose occupation
was reported as1 "odd jobs" goes on
the records under "O. T." "other
things."
While some of the occupations
which the enumerators give are un
usual, they are probably correct. A
tramp was described as "loafer, not
gainful, unemployed twelve months."
An extra thrifty person in one in
stance was reported as "occupation.
miser," and another "lives on sav
ings." A Xew England woman whose
husband was described as an "idler"
gave her own occupation as "washing
and wishiug." Minneapolis Journal.

"Eight years ago'." echoed rhillipa.
"And not a word of it to uie in all thU

She was very young then. As 1 say.
I met her and fell in love with her."
What was she. like?" demanded
rhillipa.
"She was very Weautiful. and she

rhillipa laughed. "The first is very

I. "It was a most wonderful smile.
It opened up worlds you o. never

saw her she seemed different from all
the other girls I'd ever seen. My heart
slipped its moorings then and there.
I could never call it my own after

"Always!" "said I emphatically.
We were silent again for a tiiiio.
"Dear little girl in blue." I mur

said simply.
"rerhaps I'd better explain that she
didn't really die," said I. "To other

me she died."
"Oh!" said t'hillipa meaningly.
"She wanted more worlds to conquer

"They were offered to her."
"Why didn't she take them, then?"
she said.
"That I don't know." said I.
"rerhaps slie grew tired of pride and

there were times when she wanted to

"I wonder," said I musingly.
"Let's have a light." said rhillipa.
"Don't." said I. "I wonder if she did

"Yes. she did." said she flatly.
