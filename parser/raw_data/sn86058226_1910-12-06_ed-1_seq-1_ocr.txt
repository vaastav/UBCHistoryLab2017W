OHIO DEMOCRACY
STARTS A FIGHT
Meeting Held at Columbus
Today to Discuss Candi
dates for Senator.
(American News Service)
Columbus, O., Dec. 6. Ostensibly to
map out a legislative program, but in
reality, it is believed, to discuss the
situation In regard to the United
States senatorship, many of the
Democratic members of the next legis
lature and other of the party leaders
throughout the State rounded up in
Columbus today. The conference is
called for tomorrow.. When the de
liberations of the party leaders are
concluded it is expected that It will be
possible to form a more definite idea
than at present as to the relative
strength of the several Democrats who
aspire to succeed Charles Dick in the
United States senate next March. The
names of Lieutenant-Governor-elect
AUee Pomerene, of Canton, and Ed
ward W. Hanley, of Dayton, continue
to be most recently mentioned in con
nection with the senatorship. But the
presence in Columbus recently of an
emissary . from Washington, is taken
as an indication that John R. McLean,
the Cincinnati editor, has not relin
quished his long-nourished ambition to
wear the toga and that he will be in
the fight' in earnest when the legisla
ture meets next month If he thinks
there is a possible chance for him to
win.

Bartel, Who Presents Res

District Work Houses.
MEETS APPROVAL OF
THE CITY FATHERS
To Be Presented at the Next
Session of the Legislature
New High School Is In
spected by Officials.
Square meals three times a day, a
cozy, warm place to eieep, pernaps a
little social game of poker or cribbage
in the afternoon, a sun bath on warm
days, and no work to do such is life
at the Wayne county jail, as seen by
Cour-cilman Will 11. B-rtel. Jr. :
Livst night at council meeting after
president of council to substitute for
Mayor Zimmerman, he presented res
olutions to the city fathers, asking for
district workhouse. These resolu
tions are to be sent to Senator Wal
ter Commons and Representatives E.
E. Oldaker and Reynolds, with the re
quest that the matter be placed be
fore the state legislature.
After some discussion, it was de
cided to lay the resolution over until
the next meeting, pending an investi
gation by the councllmen. The reso
lutions reflected the sentiment of the
council, but they are not strong
enough, some members believed.
They will be considered at the next
meeting.
Jail Life Is a "Cinch."
"Why, that jail life is a cinch," de
clared Bartel, and there was a general
murmur of assent from his audience.
I've gone down there and have found
the jail is simply a paradise for all
the drunks and bums in the Sixth dis
trict. They just roll in and many have
expressed TiremtelVfts as quite willing
to spend the winter there."
The councilman said, all that is now
required to make the county prison a
first class American plan hotel is a
bar, some silverware for the buffet, a
few fancy Turkish rugs and some lin
en for the tables. He etated that it
is as sanitary there as any home in
the city and everything is clean and
polished.
The purport of the resolutions are
that district workhouses should be es
tablished and the state should be dis
tricted for this purpose. The resolu
tion states that the prisoners don't
work enough and that "many persons
avail themselves of the opportunity to
go down, just for bed and room, which
are excellent." The Wayne county rep
resentatives are asked to make a de
termined effort for the passage of a
bill establishing workhouses over the
state.
Several times. Councilman Von Pein
said, this important matter has been
before the municipal league of Indi-
was said that many "undesirable citi
zens" come here from Ohio and Indi
ana, having heard of the fine condi
tions existing in the Wayne county
Jail. It is too big a task for the coun
ty to keep all the hoboes in this part
of the west, the Richmond city council
believes. -
Inspect High School.
Following the Jast night's session
of city council, the entire corps of city
officials, and other municipal attaches
made an inspection of the high school
i building on an invitation of the school
other department at which the offi-
cials looked with longing eyes was
the gymnasium. The cooking and sew
ing departments also made "a hit"
with the city fathers, and to a man
they heartily approved of the high
school building.
Superintendent Mott explained
many of the departments, stating that
there was a cooking class for work
ing girls on Wednesday evenings. This
was believed by the council to be an
excellent idea, which should be pro
ductive of much good.
"Why. it's a wonderful building,"
said one official this morning. "It looks
like a factory, especially in the forg
ing department. I'd like to work in
such a factory."

ALBERT DADISMAI1
TO REFORMATORY
Incorrigible Youth Finally
Exhausts the Patience of
Juvenile Court..
Albert Dadisman, the eleven year old
kleptomaniac, was sent to Plainfield
reformatory on Tuesday morning by
Judge Fox of the Juvenile court. The
boy has been up before the court on
several occasions for theft and during
the latter part of November, he, in
company with others, entered the
Pogue. Miller Hardware company, on
Fort Wayne avenue, stealing wares to
the value of a dollar.
Having been excused on probation
before and on each occasion failing to
appreciate the clemency shown him,
the court today refused to permit him
to remain at large aay longer. The
mother appeared to be unable to con
trol the child, who, like his thirteen
year old brother, has been very in
corrigible. This elder brother is now
in the Ohio reformatory for an offense
which he committed at Eaton, from
where he was sentenced.
Even though the child will be con-
I fined where he will probably be bene
fited, the separation between him and
his mother was touching. She was
nearly heartbroken. Her only child
now living with her Is a daughter.
There were other boys implicated
with the Dadisman child in the raid
on the hardware store. They were
not arraigned on Tuesday morning, al
though it is probable they will be be
fore the week is past. None of these
other boys have been as conspicious
in the Juvenile court as young Dadi
sman. An affidavit was filed against Willie
Sherrow a youth under 16 years of age,
who, it is alleged, stole some fruits
and vegetables from the Homer Mc
Leland company on Ft. Wayne avenue.
The boy entered the place on Novem
ber 27. This is the first time he has
been in trouble so far as the Juvenile
court is concerned. -

DISCUSS MESSAGE. k
Washington. Dec. 6. Discussion of
the President's message and the antici
pation of its reading engaged the at
tention of the members of both houses
of congress today. Each member was
furnished with a copy aa the task of
reading the long document began.
SUMMARY OF DOCUMENT.
Washington, Dec. 6. Demanding the
restoration of ' the American flag to
its ancient plape upon the seas, Preil- '
dent William H. Taft, In his annual
message delivered to congress today
urged strongly that legislation be en-"
acted to establish a ship subsidy or
otherwise guarantee the establish
ment of a rapid development of mer
chant marine in this country. '
Aside from eager appeals for the en
largement of the regular army; re- -construction
of American court - pro
cedure and the prohibition of traffic
through - the . Panama Canal ofshlps
owned by Interstate railroads the mes
sage might be summed up in the fol
lowing trinity:
National economy, the enlargement
of opportunities for foreign trade and
the strengthening of confidence of
capital and domestic investment. The
entire message is k "safe and sane"
document, strong in its conservatism.
For Merchant Marine,
The President's most urgent recpm-
mendation is in favor, of legislation'
for the institution of a mercantile
marine service and possibilities for
its expansion before the Panama canal
Is finished and one paragraph of the
speech in this connection reads:
"I alluded to this most Important
subject in my last annual message
. . . . . Unless prompt action be tak
en the completion of the Panama canal -
will find this the only great commer
cial nation unable to avail in Interna-
tional marine business of this contri
bution to the means of the .world's
commercial intercourse? Where could
we find in case of war the transports
and subsidary vessels, without which
a naval fleet is arms without a body?
For many reasons I cannot urge too
strongly upon-this cc s the pass
age of a measure by mail subsidy or
other Intervention to develop tha
American marine.
Next in the rank of Importance and
urged only a little less strongly than
the plea for a merchant marine is the
demand that the trained fighting force -of
the United States be increased by
laws augmenting the number of com- :
missioned officers and through closer
cooperation between the National
Gaurds of the various States and the
Regular standing army.
Fortify Panama Canal. '
The President urges the fortifica-
tion of the Panama canal declaring
that America is building it and that '
it is fitting that America should pro
tect It. Mr. Taft Is anxious that tha
canal become a paying enterprise, :
suggesting that the toll of one dollar :t
per net ton be charged ships passing
through. , v ' 4t
However, be adds that this is the on- -C
ly tentative. He says that' a rata
should be established which would f- i',
turn a fair profit upon the Investment v
of 1400.000.000. - " ,
President Taft takes a strong stand
in the matter , of disposing of. public k
lands bearing - coal, urging that the
government not sell these valuable- v -mineral
tracts but lease portions of
the public domain containing 1.000,- '
000.000,000 tons of coaL Mr. Taft de-J
clares In favor of making 2,500 acres '
the maximum. He frankly admits that -Secretary
Ballinger of the Interior op- ;
poses this plan: having "set orth bis
objections in his annua report.
The President believes that Con-
gress ought to prohibit interstate coni-
merce railroads from owning or con--',
trolling ships doing a business through -,
the canal, such a course bet as urged
to save the people . of the United
States the benefit of legitimate eouv
petition. This enactment must cone
sooner or later, the President point ,
of thav t j ; proud, of Economies.
