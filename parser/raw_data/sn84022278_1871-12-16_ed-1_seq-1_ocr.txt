President's Message,
Washisoton, 1. C , Dec. 4, 1871.
to the Senate nnd Hmiio of R,.presentatlviw:
In addressing my liuru annum
message to tno law-maning
of the Government, it is gratifying
to bo able to sluto inau uurin u
orallv at-
ended tho effort to execute all laws
found on tho Btatnto Uooks. x ho
policy hns been not to inqiliro into
the wisdom oi mo mw nuj
lifted, but to loiirn their spirit nnd
intent, iintl to enfbrco thi-lli .ntlcortl
ingly. Tho pin-t year, undoi' a wiso
Prov'.doneo, has been one of the gen
oral pronperity to the. nation. Il
has, however been attended with
moro than ukuuI chanlinonionts, as
in I ho loss of life and property by
Htorm and fire. While these disas
ter have served to call tortli mo
best elements of human nature in
our countrv, and to develop a friend
ship Tor us on tho part of foreign
natiotm, which goes fur townrd al
levlutinfr tho distresses occasioned
by thcM calamities, the benevolent,
who huvo so generously shared
thoir mean with tho victims of
thoRO misfortunes, will reap their
reward in the consciousness of hav
ing performed a hoblo act. nnd in
receiving tne gratefu! thanks of
mon, women and children; whoso
sufferings they havo relieved.
rottEtOX RELATIONS.
The relations ofiho United State
with foreign powers continue to be
friendly. The year has been an
cvcnltul one in witnessing two
great nations, upcakipg ono lan
guage and having one line-age, act-
al:.. mm n.inn..lnl ' a. rlS, I Ml I jflH ti I A.
. t.i,ijA vj r"1,
j pules of long standing, and liab'e at
.ny lime lo onng uioxe niuoni n,iv
a blo;dy and costly conflict. An
example has been set, which, ifsnc
cossful in it final issue, may lc fol
lowed by other civilised nations,
and finally be the means of return
ing to productive indostry millions
of mon now maintained to eettle
dispotcs of nations by the bayonet
and the broadside.

Willi Jnpnn we continue to main
tain iiilimale relations. The Cab
inet of tho Mikado has, sirico the
close of Iho lust session of Congress,
selected cilijseiia of the Uliiled
Slates to servo in ofllees of impor
tance in several department of Ihe
Government. I huvo reason to
think thai this selection is duo lo
an appreciation of tho disinterested
ness of tho policy which tho United
Slates havo pursued towards Japan.
It is our desire to continue to main
lain this disinto.ebtcd and just poll,
cy with Chilians well us Japan.
Tho correspondence transmitted
herewith shows that there is no dis
position on tho part of this Govern
ment to swerve from its established
course.
TUB roKKAN EXl'llilTION.
Prompted by n desire to put an
end to tho barbarous treatment of
our shipwrecked sailors on Iho Cor
oil n coast, I instructed our Minister
at lVkin to endeavor to conclude a
convention with Corea, for securing
till) safely and humttne treatment of
biich mariners. Admiral Rogers
was instructed to occompony him
with il suillcient foreo to protect him
in case ol'tieed. A small surveying
pa rty son t ou t, on reach i ng the coast,
Was treacherously attacked utn dis
advantage. Ample opportunity was
given Cor explanation and nppology
for tho insult, neither ciuno.
force was then landed after an ar
duous march over n rugged nnd
difficult country, the forts from
which tho outrages had boen com
mitted woro reduced by a gallant
insault, and were destroyed. Hav
ing thus punisliod'the criminals and
having vindicated tho honor of Iho
flag, tho expedition returned, find
ing it impracticable, undor the cir
cumstances, to cotielu Jo tho desired
convention. I respectfully rtfer to
tho correspondence relating thereto,
herewith submitted, and leuvo the
subject for such action as Congress
may eeo fit to tnko.
Mexico.
Tho Republic of Mexico has not
j et repealed tho very objectionable
laws establishing what is known as
the free Zono on tho frontier of tho
United Slates. It is hoped thut
this may yot be dono, and also that
moro stringent measures may bo ta
ken by the Republic for restrain
ing lawless persons on its frontiers.
I hope that Mexico, by its own.ao
lion, will soon roliovo this govern
ment of tho difficulties experioncod
from theso causes. Our relations
with tho various Republics of Cen
tral und South America eoniinuo,
with one exception, to be cordial
and friendly. I recommend some
action by Congress in regard to
overdue installments under tho
award of tho Venezuela claims com
mission of 1 SOU. Tho internal dis
sensions cf this government present
co justification for absence of effort,
lo meet their solemn treaty obliga
tions. The ratification of an extra
dition treaty with Nicaragua has
been exchanged. It is a subject
of Congratulation thut tho great
Empire of Bruiil hns taken tho ini
tiulory steps toward tho ablition of
slavery. Our relations with the
Empire were always cordial and
will naturally be made moro so by
this act It 'is not too much to hope
that the government of Brazil may
hereafter find that it for its into -est
aa well as intrinsically right, to
advance toward cntiro cmuncipu
lion moro rapidly than the present
act comteinplatc. The tone, pros
perity and greatness of a nation ia
to be found in Ihe elovation and cd
! o cation of ita laborers. It is a sub
! ject P-r regret that the rcformore in
mi direction, which were roluntar
I ily promised by the aUtesmon of
Spain have not been carried ont in

and regulation for th apparent ab
olition of slavery in Cab and Por

JAPAN.
To givo imiorlanco find lo add
lo Iho efllim y of our diplomatic re
lation wiih Japan and China, and
to further aid in retaining tho good
opinion of llics people, and lo (e
euro to th United Males its share
of the coiiim.reedeslinod to flow be
tween theso nations and the bal
ance of the commercial world, I
earnestly recommend that an np-
riropriation bo mud lo support al
ehst four American youth in each
of thos counties to serve an a part
of tho official fninily of our Minis
ters thero. Our representative',
would not even then bo placed upon
an equality wilh Iho reprosontativee
of Greul Briltun and enmo other
powers. Ah now hituutud, our rep
lesentalivc in Japan nutl China
have to depend for interpreters and
translations upon natives of thoso
countries, who know onr languago
imperfectly, or procure ocensioi ally
tho services of employees in foreign
business houses, or tho interpreters
to other foreign ministers.
SXItsllllZINd MAIL STEAMERS,
I would recommend lihe.-al metis
urs for tho pnrposo of supporting
tho American lines of steamers
now plying butween San Francisco,
Japan and China, and tho Austra
lian line almost our only roinain

For the operations of lh army in th
paet year, Ihe expense of maintaining il,
ihe estimates fur die ensuing year, and fur
continuing tho sea coast aud other itn
proreuienis conducted under th aupervis
inu of lh War Depart ttieut, 1 refer jo lo
the aooompunying report of the Secretary
ot War.
I call your atlonlion lo the provisions of
the act of Congress approved March 8,
lMfil), which discontinues promotions In
ihe stall' corps of the army until provided
for by law. I would recommend Ilm'. the
number of olliacis in each grade in th
Stan corps be fixed, aud that whenever th
number in any one graiie fall blow lh
number so fixed, that the vacancy may be
filled by promotion from Ihe grade below .
I also recommend that when the office of
chief of a corps becomes vacant, tho plaoe
limy be tilled by selection from the corps
in which ihe vacancy esisis.
THS NAVr.
The report of the Secretary of the Navy
shows nu improvement in Ihe number and
tflioiency ol Ihe naval force without uialo
rial increase itt tho expense sf supporting
it. This is clue lo tho policy which ha
been adopted nod is being extended as fast
hs our material will admit, of using small
er vessels ot the several stut.uus. ily this
means we have been enabled lo occupy at
once a luge extent of cruising groundt
and to vest mors frequently the ports
where our Hug iB desirable, and generally
lo discharge more efficiently Iho appropri
ate duties or the navy in tiiuo of peaoe,
without exceeding the number of men or
the expedition uutharUed by law. Du
ring the past year the navy has, in adJi
liou to its regular services, supplied lh
men and ollioers for Ihe visssls of the coast
survey, and has compleled th surveys au
thorized by Congr ss of th Istbinu of l)a
rien and Tehauuiepeo, and under like au
thority, has sent out an expedition com
pletely furnished and equipped, to explore
the unknown ocean of the north. Thesug
gestiom of the report as to th necessity
tor Increasing and iiuproviug the material
of the navy, and lh plan reoommendtd
for reducing lh personnel of the service
lu a peace standard by the gradual aboil
lion of certain gradis uf officers, Ihe redno
lion ol others and li employment of lb
same iu the service of 'h commercial ma
un ar well considered and deserve the
thoughtful attention of Congress.
1 also recommend that all promotions in
the navy ahove lb lank ol captain be of
selection instead ol by seniority. This
course will ecure io lb higher grai
greater efficiency, and bold out an incent
ive lo young othcers la improve theniaelve
in the knoa ledge ol ll.cir profession. Th
prcseut coat of maintaining the navy- it
cosl compared wilh that of the prcceed
ing year, and lb estimaua for in nn
iug year, ar contained in ibe accompany
ing report ol lh Secretary of lh Navy,

shal or military ollici uf lh Unit'!
States all arms, ammunition, Iniforms, dis
guises and ether roe- nnd linpUmenl
used by ihem ror carrying ont their unlaw

been heeded, on Iho 17tb of October, 1871,
another proclamation was issued suspend
ing the privileges of the writ of hubeai tor
put in nine oouoties lu that State. Direc
tion wa given thai within Ihe ountie so
designated, persons supposed upon oredi
ble litforniailon lo he member of such un

the luilitsty fores or the United Stat.s
and delivered to the Marshal, lo be dealt

th nuiiiher of persons lints arrested was
1UHI. Seven hundred whose criminality
was ascertained lo he of an Inferior dsgree,
were released for the present. These gen
erally made conf -ssioiis of their guilt
Great caution hns been exercised in mak

As scon as il nppo.red that the authori

lake vigorous measures lo enforce tin law,
many persons absoonded, and there is good
ground ror supposing that ail or s-.toh per
sons have violuiod the law. A roll report
of what has been done under this law will
be siibtnittea to Congress by the Attorney
General.
Till MOItMOJ.
In Ulnh there etill remains a remnant of
bnibuiiHin, repugnant lo civilization, to
decency and to the laws of the Unite I
Slates. Territorial officers, however, have
been found who are willing lo perform
Ibeir duty in a spirit of equity, and with
n due sense or sustaining the majesty of
the law, neither polygamy nor any other
violation of existing statutes will be per
mitted within tho territory or the United
Slates. It is not with the religion of the
self-styled saints Ihst we are now dealing,
but will, their practices. They will be
protected in the worship of Ged according
tu lh diotiitos of their own consciences,
but Ihcy will not be permitted lo violate
the laws under Ihe cloak of religion. II
may be advisable for Congress lo consider
what, in ihe execution of the laws against
polygan.v, is to be the status of plural
Wives aud their offspring. The propriety
of Congress passing an enabling act au
Ihoriiing ihe territorial legislature of Uiah
to legilitnixe all children born prior lo a
time fixed, and lb act might be justified
by its humanity towards these innocent
children. This is a suggestion only, and
not a reoommeudation.

More than six yearshaving elapsed since

one for tt.e perpetuation and the other ror
Ihe destruction of ihe Union il may well
hs consider whether it is not now His
that lh disabilities imposed by ,h 14th
