EDITORIAL NOTES.
A full pajre of our space this week is
given to President Roosevelt's mes
ege. As the first message of the new
president, it will be read with much
interest.
The MrCwIIotigh frii't to the Odd
Fellows Home has been the meant of
determining to quite an extent "who's
who" among the newspapers of the
state.
They say in Washington that Con
gressman Foster of Vermont, who
makes his debut this session, is the
handsomest member of the House.
"Handsome is as handsome does."
ISrattleboro has three doorkeepers in
the national Houses of Congress.
Their motto is, "I had rather be a
doorkeeper in the House of Congress
than to dwell in the tents of wicked
ness." "Mr. Dooley" gave ltoosevelt the
worst roasting he ever got in his
article, "Alone in Cubin." The presi
dent paid him back last week by en
tertaining him several days at the
White House.
It is now nnnounced that the pros
peels are that the two I.nmoille county
candidates for secretary of state will
come to an understanding and only
one of them will claim the county's
support. Which will lie down inside
the other ?
The canal treaty that was mangled
beyond recognition by the last Senate
will be known us the l'auncefote-llay
treaty. The one just concluded, in
which American rights are duly safe
guarded, will be known as the J!ay
Pauncetote treaty. This emphasizes
the dilference between the two.
The Populist pirty is dead. Its sen
ators and representatives in Congress
have formally allied themselves with
the Hemocracy, and Populism will
henceforth be a relie of the past only.
It was during Cleveland's administra
tion a threatening movement, but the
Democracy trimmed sails to meet it
and it fell into the pocket of the old
I'rty.
A man's house caught tire in North
field. The liretnen did their best to
save the property. After the fire, the
ehiet of the tire department was some
what surprised to receive from the
party a bill for if 10 worth ol whiskey
which he alleged the firemen stofe
from the burning house and imbibed
while lighting the flames. It was
probably of the incombustible kind,
and could have been left inide with
entire safety.
To be sure it is a spectacle calcu
lated to open the eyes of the grandees
ot Europe and many in thiseountry
that the children of President ltoose
velt attend the public schools ot
Washington, instead of being clois
tered under private instruction. Rut
it is not done tor show purposes. The
president is wise enough to know that
the welfare of his children requires
that they should meet their fellows on
the one common plane afforded by the
public schools. The Iscst hope of
democracy is the public school and its
j worst enemy private tutelage.
A few voices from the anxious seats
and the. waited sepulchres may be
heard lamenting the indecorum ot the
president of this great country attend
ing a footlall game, and so far for-
' getting the dignity of hi position as
j actually to yell with the crowd and to
Jump over a fence, silk hat in hand, so
as to get a U'tter view ot the proceed
ings, tmt the great mass of Americans
love ltoosevelt the better for it and
their respect for him and his exalted
otll-e is not one whit lessened because
they have evidence that the same warm
blood that pulses through their reins
animates the presidential frame.
Would that more of our public men
were of Koosevelt's stripe and acted
their own natural selves.
In the town of Waldcn, of the 8o0 or
I) cows tested, only two were found
HERALD AND NEW5,
affected, while in the town of Willis
ton, ot over a thousand tested, fully
.v,.,. r.i,r,h. tt-vro condemned. The
Hurlington News points out that in
the former town the ratio of deaths j
lrom consumption for the last five!
years was one to 191, while in the lat
,.e toa n if was onlv one to 2ly. This .
would seem to indicate that tubercu-
losis in cattle acts as a preventive to
tuberculosis in the individual. It
certainly sustains l'rof. Koch's theory
that the two diseases are not at all
allied and that tuberculous products
may be eaten with impunity. We im
agine that the next session ot the leg
islature will see this subject pretty
well threshed out. There is a good
deal about it that is not understood,
but such subjects are the very ones j
that Vermont legislatures delight in.
LAW AS A SWORD; NOTASHIELD.
Law is all right enough, but in it, as
in most matters, it is possible to have
too much of a good thing. Vermont
is law-ridden. Successive legislatures
assemble, and, to make a pretence of
doing something, pass more laws,
until the state is tied up with a net
work of statutes that no man can
tathom. If you doubt this, make an
honest effort to post up on your duties
as a citizen by reading the Vermont
statutes. You will probably learn to
your surprise that you are doing
things every day that subject you to
fine and possible imprisonment, if
taken up.
Vastly more sense is shown In law-
enforcement than in law-enaction, but
the possibilities of our statutes for
causing trouble and suffering and ex
pense w'thout any compensating pub
lic advantages are unlimited. It you
have nn enemy, there is a safe and
certain way for you to pay the grudge.
Head up the Vermont statutes, watch
your opportunity and revenge is as
certain as daylight. When complaints
are made as the law provides, what
ever the animus, the ollicers must do
their duty in enforcement. Then the
unlucky victim is haled to court and
branded as a public offender, con
victed and penalized, when, in fact,
he has violated some mere technicality
that no one except an enemy would
stop to notice.
Cases of this kind will occur to all
readers. A fresh instance is reported
by the Montpelier Journal. A woman
ofl'.erlin was arrested, under indict
ment, for keeping an unlicensed dog.
She was complained of by a spitetul
neighbor. She was ignorant that she
had violated any law. There was
nothing to do but plead guilty. Her
fiue of $1,5 she was unable to pay, and
would have had to work it out at Rut
land had not friends come forward and
paid it. One-third of the fine wrung
from this woman went to the venge
ful complainant. The majesty of the
law had been vindicated and justice
smiled in triumph !
The Journal well says :
"This is the law it may be good
law but it is not justice. Constables
in towns and policemen in cities of the
state are warranted in shooting at
sight all unlicensed dogs. Surely that
ought to be sulllcient to protect the
stale against any great number of
canines on which the owners have not
paid the tax provided by law.
After the law makers of 1902 have
tinkered to their heart's content the
woodchuck, muskrat, hedgehog,
moose, deer and caribou laws, amend
ed the age at which a puppy becomes
a dog, framed a new set ot rules for
road commissioners, legalized the
grand list of a few towns in which the
ollicers did not know their duty, and
decided whether or not it is wise to
spray fruit trees in blossom, they
might do vorse than to repeal out
right this law pertaining to unlicensed
dogs, which is s ire to work hardships
in individual cases, ami has done so in
one instance during the present term
of Washington county court."
A similar case occurred in a neigh
boring town. For sheltering an un
licensed dog that had come to him,
and then killing it, a man was appre
hended, and. tK'ing unable to settle the
case because he was poor, he was
taken to Chelsea jail, where he is now
in eontinenr'ut. A wife and three
little children were left without a pro
vider, destitute, and compelled to call
on the town for help, tif what conse
quence are all the dogs and dog laws
this side of Tophet compared to the
hardships of human beings needlessly
caused by their operation? Are our
laws for dogs and deer and muskrats
and lawyers or are they for men and
women ?
If all the copies of the Vermont
statutes in existence should be as
sembled in one place, and, some dark
night, fire should break out and con
sume all the volumes but one and
alrout half of that, Vermont would be
vastly better off until the next legis
lative session assembled.

REAL ESTATE.
A large deal recently resulted in about
4HI acre of Barnard's timbered land
changing hand.
Messrs. Hadlev of Marion, Mass., sold
two lots to Frank P. Robinson of Hudson,
N. H., and John A. Jacquith of Tilton,
game state, for the round aum of f lsoo.
Thit land haa been in the Hadley family
probably forty years; has heavy timber,
prineillv spruce; haa never been culled,
none taken out only what has been stolen.
The same party also bought of that live
real estate dealer, Wm. H. Edmunds of
Beibtl, the well-known Dauiel Angell
timber lot of Wrt acres and the Edward
Brannon lot of 100, both in Barnard join
ing the Hadley :; price paid for the last
two fl3U0. , .
We understand that Robinson and
Jaquith will another year erect a large
team mill and commence the manufact
ure of lumber on an extensive scale.
DOOB.
Barnard was congratulating herself on
the increased number and liner breeds of
dogs over former years, making a larger
revenue from licenses, but now comes the
reaction in paying for sheep killed. The
selectmen were quite busy Saturday, the
3oth, auditing and paying bills presented.
The amount was much larger than for
merlymore than the increased revenue
so the dog speculation is not a howling
success.
Fox hounds are a grand breed, affording
the owner a luxury no other dog can give
him, also of great benefit to poultiy
raisers, helping the income for taxes.
Now comes the pullhaclt in this case.
According to the present miserable deer
law, no dog is allowed to follow a deer off
his owner's premises under a penalty of
death and a 100 tine, one-half to tbe com
plainant. A recent cane coming to my
knowledge reads as follows: One of the
finest fox hounds in this section of Ver
mont, one that had never an inclination
for any w ild game but the fox, born, rear
ed and educated for this and this only,
was out one day following a cold track.
In crossing the hills a common cur, worth
less tor any purpose, went on in company,
the hound making no objection, supHis
inir him to be resnectable. Soon the two,
running together, started up a young
deer, the cur, a shepherd, yelling in pur
auit. the hound trailing. On they went
until they reached the river w nere lue
deer crossed, going into the forest safely;
but Mr. Hound found himself locked in a
county official's, arms. He made no denial
of beiiig in bad company or of identifica
tion, showing his legal collar plainly
marked w ith the owner's name. Acknow l
edging his guilt, a siring confined him
until his master was notified. He came at
once and was allowed to take the dog
home alive to await the action of Windsor
count v court.
Who can say that this poor dog or his
owner are guilty of breaking any legal
statute of the state of Vermont ?
ROADS AND ROAD COMMISSIONERS.
Frank C. Churchill, road conmisgioner
for Barnard, has rented his farm and mov
ed into the village where he can look after
the winter travel.
The expense of breaking roads has
reached such large figures that it becomes
necessary for the commissioner to Bend
more time in winter even than summer.
Most of the farm roads have to be opened
every storm.
Twenty years ago it was very seldom
that the town was called upon for any ex
pense. Now there are but few w ho are not
allowed pay.
When Solon Pan forth moved from the
hotel to bis farm, he broke the road in
winter to the village, keeping an account
of all time niient by men and teams, mak
ing a bill of about 70. He presented thia
to the auditors, w ho told him to go to the
selectmen as they had no authority to
audit bills aside from town officers'.
The selectmen refused, saying it was an
expense not ordered even by a surveyor.
Then he carried in the lull to open town
meeting and it created some excitement
and much hot talk.
One man, making a fiery speech in op
position, said, "Allow this bill and you
will soon have to break a road into every
man's yard Bnd shovel out hiadoor." Were
Mr. Lillie alive now he would say, "I told
you so, and you can see where you are at."
It seems necessary for the commissioner
to have personal superv ision of the ex
pense laid out in winter, not giving every
farmer carte blanche to bring in his bill.
Barnard taxpayers are very submissive,
patient and, as a general thing, cheerful
under the yoke, selling turkeys, cnicKens,
pigs and lambs in order to meet the collec
tor lec. 1st.
As far as my knowledge extends, 1901 is
no exception, delinquents being very few
State to say it is a banner year and bests
the record. Home say it is mighty hard to
be virtually cleaned out of pocket every
fall in order to pay the taxes, isut wben
we think it takes over f-1,000 to run the
schools and roads, added to all other ex
penses, with grand list of only about
fltVIO, how can it be otherwise than high
rates t
All summer it did seem pleasant to see
tbe roads repaired, schools kept at tbe
town s expense and parents paid tor trans
portation, but it is hard in the end to foot
the bill.

tough to pay the fiddler after the dance
