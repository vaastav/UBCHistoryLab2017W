Two POINTED QUESTIONS ANSWERED.
What is the use of making a better
article than competitor if you can not
get a better price for it?
Ans.—As there is no difference in the
price the public will buy only the bet
ter, so that while oiir profits may be
smaller on a single sale they will be
much greater in the aggregate.
How can you get the pnblic to know
your make is the best?
If both articles are brought promin
ently before the public both arc certain
to be tried and the public will very
quickly pass judgment on them and
use only the better one.
This explains the large sale on
Chamberlain's Cough Remedy. The
people have been using it for years and
have found that ic can always be de
pended upon. They may occasionlly
take up with some fashionable novelty
put fourth with exaggerated claims
but are certain to return to the one
remedy that they know to be reliable
and for coughs, colds and croup there
is nothing equal to Chamberlain's
Cough Remedy. For sale by all Drug
gist.

's Message.
Following the long established pre
cedence ths president has submitted
his annual address to Congress while
it is extremly long which of necessity
it must be, it is a wull written strong
document touching nearly all the im
portant questions of interest to the
Americans except the recent race wars,
murders and the Illinois miners trouble
which we fondly wished and earnestly
hoped to have seen those thing mention
because no dojabt hundreds yea thou
sands loyal Americans anxiously scan
ned the message to see if those cruli
ties and horriable horrors has been
dealt with in the doeument yet we will
be conservative have patience and wait
further developments wrong will be
righted. He then states the circum
stances and events that lead up to war
with Spain, he reviews the history of
that remarkable struggle and among
hit recommendations are the construc
of the Nicaragua canal, the increase of
our army and navy. He leaves the
Philippine question until after the
treaty of peace has been signed.

low State Register
Is Wrong.
Their Article is Mislead
ing and Unfair.
Below we print the editorial o{
Clarkson in his Sunday issue of the
Register:
The colored pitizens of numerous
citics are holding meetings topassreso-'
lutions denouncing the atrocious murd
ers of Negroes in the South, and ap
pealing to the president and congress
to investigate the conditions and enact
and enforce lawp that will protect the
Negroes, but we have not yet seen a
resolution passed by those meetings
which condemns the equally atrocious
acts of tho Negroes! Both races are
guilty of crimes, and the crimes of both
should be condemned by all such meet
ings. The murders at Wilmington, N
C., were caused by a cowardly mulatto
—a black and white scoundrel—who
escaped the punishment he should have
received, but his dirty and degraded
work caused the murder of a number
of innocent black people. It is admit
ted that the editorial printed in the
Wilmington (N. C.) Record, written by
A. L. Manly, and published in that pa
per on the 18th of last August, was the
canse of the recent murders of the
Negroes at that place. Here is the
whole editorial:
"A Mrs. Felton from Georgia, makes
a speech before the Agricultural Soci
ety at Tybee, tia., in which she advo
oates lynehing as an extreme measure.
This woman makes a strong plea for
womanhood, and if the alleged crimes
of race were half so frequent as it oft
times reported, jher plea would be
worthy of consideration.
Mrs." Felton, like many other so-called
Christians, loses, sight of the basic
principle of the Religion of Christ in
her plea for outclass of people as
against another. If a missionary spirit
is essential for the uplifting of the poor
white girls, why it? The morals of
the poor White »ople are on a par
with their colore* neighbors of like
conditions, and if .ny one doubts the
statement let hin visit among them.
The whole lump ads to be leavened
by those who prol iss so much religion
and Bhowing thei that the preserva
tion is an essential 'or the life of any
people.
Mrs. Felton bef |as well, for she ad
mits that educatioi will better protect
girl£ on the farm fom the assaulter.
This we adm!£' aM it akoold ioth^
confined to^he wlwBuymQrethan to
..Ml
often wftii ivports of ri,pes 6¥ white
women, and the subsequent lynohing
of the alleged rapists. The editors
pour fourth volleys of aspersions
against all Negroes because ot the few
who may beguilty. If the papers and
speakers of the other race would con
demn the commission of crime because
it is a crime and not try to make it ap
pear that the Negroes were the only
criminals, they would find their strong
est allies in the intelligent Negroes
themselves, and together the whites
and blaek6 would root the evil out of
both races.
We suggest that the whites guard
their women more closly, as Mrs. Fel
ton says, thus giving no opportunity
for the human fiend, be he white or
black. You leave your goods out of
doors and then complain because they
are taken away. Poor white men are
careless in the matter of protecting
their women, especially on farms.
They are careless of their conduct to
ward them, and our experience among
poor white people in the coantry teach
es us that the women of that race are
not any more particular in the matter
of Clandestine meetings with colored
men than are the white men with col
ored women. Meetings of this kind
go on for some time, until the wo
man's infatuation or the man's bold
ness bring attention to them and the
man is lynched for rape. Every Neg
ro lynched is called a "big burly, black
brute," when in fact many of those
who have thus been delt with had
white men for their fathers, ana were
not only not "black" and "burly," but
were sufficiently attractive for white
girls to fall in love with them, as is
well known to all.
Mrs. Felton must begin at the foun
tainhead, if she wishes to purify the
stream.
Teach your men purity. Let virtufe
be sometbing more than an excuse
for them to intimidate and torture
a hepless people. Tell your men that
it is uo worse for a black man to be in
timate with a white woman than for a
wVite man to be intimate with a color
ed woman.
You set yourselves down as a lot of
carping hypocrites in fact, you cry
aloud for the virtue of your women,
while you seek to destroy the morality
of ours: Don't think ever that your
omen will remain pure while you are
debauching ours. You sow the seed—
the harvest will come in due time."
The degraded and vicious scoundrel
who wrote that editorial should have
died at the end of a rope, no matter
whether he was white or black, but the
brate who wrote it is now posing as a
martyr, notwithstanding his own low
and degraded mind is responsible for
the murder of some eight or ten inno
cent Negroes!
Nothing can be gained by denounc
ing the vicious and degraded men of
another race, and attempting to shield
the chief criminal because ho is of the
same race of the people holding the
public meetings. The Wilmington
editor is the chief criminal in the murd
ers at that place, for he was the author
of the editorial which caused the des'
traction of his printing office and plant
and the consequent murder of some
eight or ten innocent negroes. Yet
that cowardly scoundrel and falsifier
escaped punishment and not one word
is said against his base action in any
resolutions adopted, not withstanding
the fact that any man, white or black,
who printed such statements as to
white or black women should be corn-

pelled to suffer violent dea'.h.
We were very much surprised to
read such an editorial from tKe reg
ister, that is to encourage or advise
lynching of a person for simply
writing^ the article which appears
alcove. We don't believe that you
Mr. Clarkcon represent the ideas of
the better thinking class of people,
certainly not the christian people.
We do not think that your editoral
represent equality or justice as you
|ve jprfefofoj* held out to the
furthermore jjtat d
itorsl represent the spirit of tne re
publican party which you slaim to
champion and which fully 9-ioth. of
the colored people has supported all
their political life, then we have had
the wrong conception of true repub
licanism. It is true that meetings
are being held all over America by
colored people condeming lawless
ness and recent lynching in the
south. It is true that a crime is a
crime whether done by a colored
man or white man and should be
condemn by all good citizens, if
a colored man commits a crime he
should be made to suffer, but that
punishment should be by law, again
Mr. Clarkson in his ever truthful
Register says that Manley's article
was the cause of the white people
killing so many innocent Negroes on
election day, that statement is not
true and cannot be so from the log
ic of facts, because the article which
he refers to was printed on the 18th
of last August and those Negroes
was lynched on election day and the
day after the election which was the
8 and 9, of November, if that article
enraged those white people, why was
not his press destroyed when the
act was committed? Then again
Mr. Clarkson the white men of the
South debauch and rape many a
helpless innocent colored women
there is nothing done and the poor
women dare not mention it. The
manner of Clandestine meeting of
the two races is ample proof from
the various color of the colored race
especially in the South, herefore we
had been proud to hold out the Reg
ister as the beacon light of progress
equality and justice for all people
also a special champion of our race
advancement, but recent develop
ments has led us to think the reverse.
