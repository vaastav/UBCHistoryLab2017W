THE LAKGEST C'UlCUtATIOJf
Of Any Daily Published in East Tennessee.
THE EX-PRESIDENT AND GOV. BSOWN.
H. V. R., of the Cincinnati Commercial,
has just completed his fifteenth interview
with ex-Fresident Johnson, and "writes a
racy letter upon what Andy eaicL Among
other things he alluded to Gov. Brown,
which H. V. R. reports as follows :
The ex-President considers himself badly
treated ly John C. Rrown, the present Gover
nor of Tennessee. "When Brown came out of
the nrtny Johnson pardoned him, thus restoring
him to citizenship and protecting his property
from confiscation. Brown always professed
much gratitude for this, but when J oh neon ran
for the Senate, the whole family of Browns
took a vcrvdocided 6tand againsc him. "When
Brown made his canvass for Governor, he call
ed upon the eiPreeident at hia place, ex
pressed his gratitude for his pardon, as it was a
pearl without price at the time, and alio wished
Mr. Johnson to understand that he was not in
the caucus that caused his defeat in the Senate,
that he had been misrepreienled, &c.
Tho ex-President talked to him pretty plain
ly, telling him that he wished to hear nothing
about gratitude, as that hzd " played out." He
accused Brown of having taken a decided stand
against him for the Senate, and doing his best
to cause his defeat, even if he was not present at
the caucus. Thi3 Brown could not. deny, and
the two distinguished Tennesseeans parted cold
ly, and have not "exchanged observations'
since. In Brown's last speech of the canvas?,
at Memphis, he pitched into Johnson, calling
him a "malcontent and political harlot." "1
will remember him for that," said Mr. John
son, "and intend to reply to it some of these
days."
SECRETARY BOVXWZLL'8 REPORT. .
Secretary Boutwell, in his annual report
jut submitted to Congress, in reference to
the reduction of taxes, takes the ground
that the nation is able to pay $50,000,000 of
the principal of the public debt annually,
aud thiuks the reduction should be made
with this view, lie thiuks it practicable
to d'spense with all revenue from internal
sources', except that derived from stamps,
spirits, tobacco and malt liquors. He
thiuks these sources should furnish a rev
enue of one hundred and ten millions,
which would be a reduction, on present
rates of about sixteen millions of dollars,
or about twelve and a half per cent. He
thiuks a reduction of twenty millions may
be made in customs, which, -would be a to
tal reduction of thirty-six millions.
In this view he recommends the reduc
tion of the duty on salt, 50 per cent.;
that the duty on bituminous coal be
fifty cents per ton. He also recom
mends a reduction on raw hides and skins,
aud the removal of all duties from a large
class of articles, which enter into the arts
and manufactures of this country, and
which are not produced in the United
States, aud the revenue derived from
r
which is inconsiderable.
He also suggests that "the removal of
duties from a large class of articles used in
manufactures, and the reduction of the
duties on coal, furnish an opportunity for
a moderate decrease in the rates of duties
uion those products whose cost will be di
minisbed by their changes."
gress will. make larger ; deductions than
the able Secretary suggests!, whether wise
ly or not, we do not undertake to say.
Certain it is that the taxes for next year
will be reduced at least thirty-six millions.
This is a most gratifying result better
than any one anticipated six years ago.
WHAT THE PAPERS SAT OF IT.
To the exclusion of editorial matter we
present this morning what the. press says
about the President's message. The Mem
phis Avalanche says
To tho exclusion of much other matter of in-
terest wo print this morning the Message of the
President of tho United States delivered yes
terday to Congress, by far tho most important
of General Grant's State papers. In our col-
ul as will also be found tho material portions of
the annual report of the Secretary of the Treas
ury.
From the Union and American.
seems predetermined to be satisfied with
eve: thing, and tho'siraplicityof his satisfaction
must be refreshing to any one conversant with
current events. Civil service reform is prom
ised as complacently as it was one year ago. In
the same way, the President's argument for the
i r - e ' i
Grant's report to President Johnson on the con
dition of the South xix years ago, and his later
delusive cry "Let us have peace," "We hope
it will have more weight with Congress. The
promise of a reduction of taxation will be grat
ifying to the people, North as well as South, if
Secretary .Boutwell, to wnom we are referred,
gives the proper figures. Until wo see the lat
ter' report, we must withhold opinion on this
only substantial point ot the Presidential ines
eage.
From the Courier-JonrnaL
The President's message is simply a review of
the past year i work, and a statement of the re
lations ot tho Lmtea btates with loreign coun
tries, lie makes few suggestions, or none at alL
the matter of general amnesty is handled in a
delicate and rather non-commital manner. If
anything, he seems to lean forward the propo
sition with, still, certian restrictions and ex
ceptions. The Spanish uimculties are passed
over with the assertion that the government
means to protect American citi'-.ns' in Cuba.
There is little consolations for 'e Mormons,
while the Indians are still cajoled and petted.
A mere history of the South Carolina matter is
given, and Akerman is left to do tho justifica
tion part of it Our relations with England and
the Cztir are represented to be extremely cor
dial, and the Geneva conference promises to do
welL
From the Baltimore gun.
In conclusion the President declares himself
in favor of such civil servico reform as will viait
the responsibility for bad appoiutnients upon
those who recommend improper persons for of
fico to the appointing power. lie refers to the
commission appointed under tho act of Con
gress of March 31, 1871, to devise regulations
lor the reform of the civil service, and promises
to give to tho experiment a fair trial.
Taken as a whole, the message is of moderate
length, simple and unpretentious in its style,
rather negative than positive in its merits, and
certainly less aggressive in its tone and recom
mendations than might have been apprehended,
and perhaps, by a certain class of political ex
tremists and faetionbts,rwas desired, r-
From tho Washington Chronicle,
Congress reassembled yesterday, and . the
President's message was communicated to the
llouseand read about 2 p.m.: This document
will be found in our columns to-day. It is a
plain, sensible, business-like document, clear
and terse in its style, and replete with useful in
formation. The President take ground for what is called
"universal amnc.-ty." We have no objection
to this. "We havo uniformly favored it. But
the President seems to lump all the Southern
whites together. There are thousands of South
ern white men who preserved their integrity
from first to last, and who are to day as loyal as
any citizens in the country. There are thou
sands of others who offended as against the na
tion only technically, under the force of circum
stances which no human power could have re
sisted, and who wero always at heart faithful to
the old flag. These . classes of Southern men
wore as anxious that General Grant should take
Vicksburgand Petersburg as he was. They
rejoiced when he triumphed,- and mourned
when ho seemed to fail. Some of these are
banned technically. They would resent indig
nantly any comparison which might be made
between themselves and, the "great criminals"
referred to in the message. But, without ro
gard to this, and in spite of this, we may let
amnesty be granted. Let it cover all. The na
tion can allord to be magnanimous. Many of
those whom it is proposed to relieve are as loyal
now as they will be ten years hence. They will
neithor bo hardened or softened by delay. They
are set, even as the northern star is, and they
will never change,
As a matter of course, the President will bo
assailed. This is to be expected. But, con
scious of the rectitude of his intentions, and
aiming, as we believe he does, at tho good of
tho whole country,!hev can? afibrd to disregard
these assaults. History will : make, its record,
which will not be affected by the passions ot
thjs hour, nor effaced by malevolence or envy,
lie is to be judged, not 6o much by what he 6ays
as by what he does. His words may bo written
now and then on sand, but his deeds will sur
vive him in imperishable marble. "Blessed is
the peacemaker." It is far better to compose
troubles than to create them ...

very severe in their allusions to Tammany

NEW-ADVERTISEMENTS.
Winter Wisdom.
Warm clothing alone will not protect the body again
the consequences of the sudden depression of tempera
ture which is concomitant of early winter. Flannel
next the skin preserves the' animal heat, bat it does not
impart animal vigor. That property is the special pre
rogative of Hostettcr's Stomach Hitters, which is there
fore a specific protection against a majority of the com
plaints which are most common at this season. For
example, & course of the great vegetable invigorant,
commenced now, will be almost sure to preclude chills
and fever, bilious colic, disorders of the stomach, con
stipation, and many other complaints which are often
the direct or indirect effect of an atmosphere surcharg
ed with cold, unwholesome vapor. Moreover, the sys
tem toned and regulated by this means is much more
likely to resist pulmonary disease than it would other
wise be ; for the influence of searching medicine per
vades all the organs, and every fibre and tissue of the
frame. Persons whose vital powers are weak, especial
ly invalid ladles and the aged, are' earnestly recom
mended not to face the winter's rigor without having
recourse to this safe and sufficient means of re-enforcing
the enfeebled nature. Much suffering may be es
caped, much danger averted by following this counsel.
Better late thaa never, is a good proverb, but it is bet
ter to be early than Iato.
