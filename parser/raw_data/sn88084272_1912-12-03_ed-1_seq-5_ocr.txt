WHO WILL BE ARI
ZONA'S MESSENGER?
Phoenix. Arts., Dec. 3. When the
Democratic presidential electors of Ari
zona meet in January to be civen their
: credentials and appoint one of them
I selves to attend the meeting of the
' electoral college In Washington, there
promises to De a rivalry oetween elector
elect Wiley E. Jones and elector elect
W. T. Webb as to -which of them shall
be the messenger. Elector elect J. R.
Hampton doesn't want the job. It is
said. Jones holds that Inasmuch as he
received more than 100 more votes than
either of his competitors, he should be
made the messenger, Webb says the
matter will be put to a vote and the
man getting two votes will go. He
thinks Hampton will vote for him and
he knows he will vote for himself.
Therefore, he feels confident of election.
The job carries no salary, but there
Is an honor attached and, besides, the
government allows 25 cents per mile to
eac hmessenger. As Phoenix is about
2000 miles from Washington, the Ari
zona messenger will "draw down" about
500 in mileage, which will help pay
his expenses while telling Messrs. Wil
son and Marshall all about their election.

An ingenioos pka is followed doss cm ae Tsthnraa of Panama, to
provide comfortable homes for the "workmen. A great number of freight
cars "which have oat-lived their usefulness are collected to form carious
little villages. A simple foundation is .prepared, by driving four posts in the
earth, which supports the corners of the cars. Doorways and windows
are then cut in the cars, and a flight of steps in front lends a decidedly
homelike atmosphere. The doors and windows are carefully screened,
and sanitary rales are strictly observed. The street of box-car homes illus
trated herewith, was photographed by a tourist on one of the winter
cruises of the S. S. Moltke of the Hamburg-American Line. One of the
great advantages of this style of architecture is the village may be readily
mcrved from place to place. Box-car homes are lifted by a derrick to flat
cars, carried to the new settlement, and swung to their new foundations.
In some cases elaborate architectural effects have been attempted. One or
more box-cars are grouped together, and the space between them is roofed
aver and enclosed.
