that's the use of a Var with Japan In the words of the southern
' poet. "rxy ain't no u-e." What's the use of a Hague conference again,
"Dey ain't no use. iSuch little matters as International .squabbles with Jap
an can be far more easily settled. If we really must fight with Japan;
If Aokl Is going home to complete the sinister arrangements; If Nippon In
tends to fall upon our unsuspecting 'squadron In the straits of Magellan-, If
the proud heart of the Samurai Is bursting to erupt over the smiling face
of that polite nation; If there's nothing to it, after all, but a desperate con
flict Why not settle It by a base ball game.
Next to ourselves, Japan Is most civilized of nations. Japan alone has
shown an aptitude for our national game. The dark recesses of the dia
mond's strategy present no Insuperable difficulty to the Nipponese Intelli
gence. Did not ,a picked nine from Toklo or Nagasaki or Fusiyama or
somewhere or other defeat the very flower of an American battleship crew
only a little while ago?
War Is more than ever what the redoubtable general said It was. Should
the worst come to the worst with European nations, there might be no al
ternative. They still believe in cricket and golf and rowing and skat and
a brand of foot ball which employs the feet only.- They have refused to
be enlightened by us as Japan has They have consistently repudiated the
greatest boon to civilization.
An international base ball game to settle such vexed Issues as those
of Immigration and mutual relations would adjust the entire matter without
either delay or bloodshed. Besides, It would be less expensive. The only
danger would be that which might arise from hard feeling.', and in that
case it. would be easy to take It out on the umpire.
May me commend this to congress, or must Ambassador Aokl take the
Initiative?
It looks good to ee dozens of loads of alfalfa on the streets of Albuquer
que very day In the week. lit looks good to see the prices that alfalfa
brings; it looks good to see farm produce of all kinds being sold In Albu
querque and consumed in Albuquerque particularly when it was raised
within ten miles of Albuquerque up and down the Rio Grande valley; It
looks good to see the biggest Christmas displays our merchants have ever
made; it looks good to fee the local stores and shops crowded all day long;
It looks good to see the loads of Christmas presents that are being sent
"back east" bought with Albuquerque money In Albuquerque; -It looks good
to see our streets filled with well dressed and well fed women and children,
the families of busy men; it looks good to see our citizens working over
time to entertain the big commercial congress; it looks good to see that
twenty men from this city alone have volunteered .to visit Washington In be
half of statehood;. It looks sood to see real money passing over the counters
of our merchants and our banks when the east Is using certificates; it looks
good to see the big American Lumber company running full force, and the
other Industries of which we boast, asking for employes; It looks good to
see hundreds of people arriving on each incoming train to spend the winter

when she looks better than ever.
at Is a wise country that keeps Its citizens well employed at home.
Every country owes It to the people to give them employment within the
confines of Its own territory and when a country gets so that it can no
longer do so there is something radically wrong with Its social system.
Therefore in aiding In passing an exclusion act against Japanese coolie labor,
Japan would only be working towards her own social good if at home she
adjusts conditions so as to care for her own people. tkt long as this coun
try can promise openings to her young men she will never lack for blood
brawn or brains in an emrgincy. When she can no longer provide for
them, her days of tribulation are at hand.
Judge Parker, who has sentenced nearly every' saloon keeper in Socorro
county to pay a small fine for violating the Sunday law. evidently believes
that they needed a more practical lesson than a mere lecture. He backed
up the fine with the statement that he would impose the Jail sentence
hereafter. If the saloon keepers of Socorro county have been violating the
law, Judge Parker ought to give them about one day of the Sunday law
as It was recently enforced in this city. Too much of a good thing is often
needed to teach some people to let well enough alone. The saloon keepers
of Socorro county got off easy and they ought to appreciate It.
In sending Funston to Goldfield the war department has made a bitter

CRISIS IS REACHED
AT GOLDFIELD, NEV.
Mine Owners 1K Martini I .aw Vio
lence h I'Vared strike
breakers linuly.
Goldfield, Nev., Dec. 11. Governor
Sparks and Col. Reynolds, who is in
command of the troops here, held a
conference this morning and separat
ed without deciding the matter of de
claring martial law.
It appears that fhe mine owners
are strongly urging the governor to
take u ik step ueiore me arrival ui ,
General Funston on Thursday.
The governor and the colonel wilt
diwuss the matter again this after
noon. Reynolds was shown or
worth about $20 a pound, which was
taken from "high graders" arrested
last night, lie said he would like to
stop such outrages, but was unwilling
to take a decisive step until the ar
rival of Funstos.
The Mine Owners association still
asserts that mines will be opened to
morrow morning and that they have
men engaged to work them. The ef
fort to have marcial law declared to
day Is for the purpose of allowing
troops to patrol the mines and to
search for concealed arms and am
munition which is alleged to be held
by strikers in various place They
fear that attempts to destroy ma
chinery and power wires or the wat
er supply works will be made to
night unless the soldiers take charge.
On the other hand the union men say
there will be no violence nor de
struction of property. Captain Swain

W. Johnson as to the killing of Goe
bel and of the purchase by Toutsey
of smokeless cartridges in Cincinnati.
11a said before the cartridges were
bought Johnson could shoot Goebel
from the secretary of state's window.
Youtsey detailed the events lead
ing to the tragedy and the prepara
tions which he had arranged for the
shooting. It was Youtsey who met
James Howard, who Is alleged to
have done the shooting, upon his ar
rival in Frankfort. Youtsey told of
(placing guns In Powers' otnee, rais
ing the window and drawing the cur
tain to the window, of pointing out
Goebel as he approached the capitol
and seeing Howard aim at his vic
tim. He then left the room and
heard the crack of the rifle as he was
descending the stairs. The witness
connected Powers directly with the
tragedy by stating that he fixed the
door for the entrance of the assassin
and approved of the plan. Y'outsey
also said former Governor Taylor
dictated a letter to him asking How
ard to come to Frankfort to "do the
Job."
Y'outsey testified that Taylor stated
ne would give ti,iuu, a paraon ana
a military escort to the mountains 10
the man who would kill Goebel.
Youtsey identified the original af
fidavits which he gave Powers while
both were in the Louisville Jail, in
which Youtsey , made oath thai he
knew nothing against Powers to con
nect him In any way with the assas
sination of Goebel. The aiiidavit, tne

In fifteen days. Youtsey stated that

A LETTER FROM
HAWLEY ON THE CORNER
There's no use talking, a "Kodak
Record" Is the most authentic rec
ord of places and events that you
can keep. No matter if you have the
gift of an Irving, your word picture
will not measure up in fidelity to a
kodak picture. And then think of
the fun of it.
Some one, enthusiastic In his praise
of the Eastman kodak, has said: "If
It Is nf an Eastman, It isn't a kodak."
Now we have the finest lot of Fast
man's in the city, and we suggest
that you try one for a Christmas gift.
The time has passed when a nicely
padded edition of one of the poets
no matter which or a gilt framed
picture no mattes what will satis
fy. Your friend wants change, and
1 .don t blajne him.
Try him. or her. on a kodak.
Don't forget that we rent kodaks
to those who do not possess them.
and we will finish up and mount the
pictures artistically after you have
taken them. Call around and look
