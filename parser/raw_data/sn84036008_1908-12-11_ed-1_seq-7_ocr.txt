PRATT WANTS TO
KILL MORE MEN
(Continued from First Page.)
Mrs. Sharp, who fired two of the shots
that struck Policeman Mullane, was
confined in the city jail.
Mrs. Pratt bemoaned the death of
her daughter, 'Lulu, aged 13, who was
shot during ,the second stage of yester
day's battle, when the women and
children, took a row boat on the 'Mis
souri river and attempted to escape.
At the hospital this morning..it was
said that Patrolman Mullane had small
Chances of recovery but that Sergeant
Patrick Clark's condition was slightly
improved. A. J. Selzer, the bystander,
who was hit by a bullet, also is ex
pected to recover.
'Mary Pratt, the little 11-year old
sister of the dead girl, displayed the
same remarkable coolness shown 'by
her elders, when questioned by the
police. She did not cry when told of
her sister's death ':She died for her i
God," 'was the child's remark.
Mrs. Pratt, in a, statement, told of a
the band's work.
"Mr. and Mrs. Sharp, our leaders,"
said Mrs. Pratt, "were known to us d
as Adam and Eve and we believed
their teachings. It was revealed to
Mrs. Sharp last summer that our
meetings were not to be interfered
with again. We armed ourselves 'If
the police attempt to arrest us, shoot,'
said our leader. 'They cannot kil me.
I'll live 'forever.' The first I heard of i
the tragedy yesterday was when Lulu. I
and Mary came running down to the
boat and told me that the shooting I
was going on.
"Then the officers dame and wanted
to take us away. I got my Winchester
downccf the wall; told'Lulu tq get a
gun. and we all got into a skidff that
was tied to the houseboat. I sat in
the bow with mly gun in my hands.
I was not going to shoot unless I had
to because I had no chance to ask
either Adam or Eve what to do. I
am .sorrPy I did not resist. i'm afraid
I have lost my eternal life, 'becaise I
think Adam would have advised me to
shoot.
"Lulu got into the back of the skif,
which was covered, and Mary took
the oars and we started across the
river. The officers began shooting at
the boat. We drifted up to the bank
and 'when I saw blood 'on Lulu's ear
I knew that she was shot. Then Mary
and I got out and hung on the side
of the boat until they captured us,"
Mrs. Melissa Sharp, a slender wo
man of middle age, whose statement
was taken by anOther officer, detailed
the occurrences leading p to yeate
day's fight and then told of t.he rwn
derings of the band.
ITwag born in ifetind a 'r o
37 years ago, on a'fEl" s;i'
Sharp. "I married Sharp, a far.4 ;20@
yearis ago and we went to.,it f
Later we went to Oki.hola and tai+
up a claim. We had
atsla , Albout six years:ago my hiss
band came home one night; and said
he dldL iot-think we were living right.
He had' hasd a revelation o9pihc. faitih of
God.; We began to reid thie Bble'..td
a week later, I got the revelation.
Then we both repented for two weeks,
we mourned-not because we wanteld
to, but because we could not help it.
The spirit of God came to us the
same as it came to Adam, David and
Christ. We then sold our farm and
gave =the money 'away to people who
needed it and started out to preach.
"Since then we have traveled
through Oklahoma, Texas, Kansas,
Missouri and Illinois. Then we went
north to Minnesota and last summer
spent some time in North Dakota. One
man vvho found the light sald allfhis
property and 'put $7,000 l' a common
fund.
"About last August when we came
back from Canada we built a house.
boat and started down the Missouri
river from a place in~ontana near
White Earth.
"We floated down the river stopping
and preaching at (towns and some
times camping in the woods. In many
places we have been persecuted by the
officers who 'wanted to take our chil
dren away from us and make them go
to school.
"Me 'have been armed 'for many
months. I have 'practiced shooting
and 'my older children have practiced
shooting. None of the children can
read' or write. We teach them, but we
teach them righteousness. Paul says
'the wisdom of the world is foolish.
Christ chose his disciples from ignor.
ant people. Christ did not 'go to
school. My husband and I 'can read
and write. That is enough to teach
the Bible."
Chief of Police Ahearn announiced
that yesterday's bloodshed affair would
mark an end to street meetings in
Kansas City and ordered his men to
allow no more speakers to address
crowds on public thoroughfares.

he went to view a change of countJ
road, and to see that the work wam
properly done.
He states that that section of Yel

Mr. Colton was also at Hardin lass
week viewing roads and staking oul

company of Minneapolis have con
tracts. Work is progressing nicely or
the Big Horn High Line ditch and the
Hardin district will be the center o0
agricultural activity next season.
The settlers in the Hardin districi
are energetic as is being evidenced by
the number of county improvements
in the way of roads and bridges, many
of which are being laid out and con
structed.
The numerous new irrigation enter
prises have made the construction oi
several bridges a necessity in that sec.
tion and all of the structures being
put in are of steel and of a very sub.
stantial nature.

Mrs. Crawford is on her way to
