Very few of our readers have proba
bly taken the trouble to read the presi
dent's message. It is a clumsy, stub
born synopsis of a year's administra
tion, the dullness of which is somewhat
relieved by a futile effort to whitewash
himself, and lay the blame of the mor
tal defeat of the republican party upon
everything but himself. The portions
of it referring to the south aud nation
al finances are intended to conciliate

'where be has been tickled.
It is not to be expected that any
'.movement looking to our securing all
.rail communication with New Orleans
'would be very palatable to either Gal
veston or Houston. Both have watched
' With a jealous eye all of the recent ne
gotiations relative to the New Orleans
and Dallas railway, and Dallas may
expect a vigorous effort, on the part of
Houston particularly, to diverge the
Jlne of the road to Houston. This will
not suit us. Our people wish Houston
success, but charity begins at home.
Nearly every one of our state ex
changes have been discussing the pro
priety of a usury law being enacted.
Miles of argument pro and con have
been spun out. Some contending that
such a law will drive capital out of the
state instead or inviting it here, to
auoh an extent as to cheapen money
through an ample supply ; and others
that unless some limit is put upon In
terest, which shall be a safeguard, the
very substance of the people will be
devoured in time. When the matter
comes up for action, either In the pro
posed constitutional convention or the
legislature, Tub Herald will define
Its position on tbe subject.
One thing is as clear as the noon
day tun. Tbe International road
question must be put peacefully and
Justly at rest. Tbe people are weary
of it TheHiHALD does not propose
to discuss here the legality or justice
of the company's claims. The whole
matter has been gone over until It is
the greatest of bores. Either the de
cision of tbe legislature or the supreme
court must be acted upon and made
final. To refer It to the people would
be to put it within tbe corrupting in
fluences of purchasable politicians, ve
nal presses and demagoguery. Lift
tbe question out of tbe reach of these,
and settle It honorably and at once.

Tbe Brenham (Texas) Banner says :
"Dr. Gideon Lincecum, a well
known citizen of this county, died at
Long Point, Washington county, on
November 28, 1874. He was nearly
eighty-three years of age and was a
member of Captain Varner's company,
In the regiment commanded by Col
onel Freeman, of General Floyd's
brigade of dragoons, iu the war of
1812. For many years this gentleman
bas devoted his time to scientific pur
suits, and was well known in scientific
circles throughout tbe world. A few
years ago he went to Tuxpan, Mexico,
but returned to die surrouuded by his
children in Texas."
A friend who has known Dr. Lince
cum long and well, begs space In the
Herald to add a few remarks to tbe
above.
The deceased was a native of Geor
gia, but lived about twenty years at
Columbus or Aberdeen, Mississippi,
before coming to Washington, Texas,
in about 184A In 1868 be went to Tux
pan and spent about four years. At
tbe time of bis death be was probably
in his eighty-second year.
Dr. Ltnoecum was a man of learning,
and a naturalist of high attainments.
Among other studies he spent bis Idle
hours for fourteen years, in Washing
ton county, In studying the habits of
the large red ant, common all over the
state, and then wrote a pamphlet giv
ing tbe results. It Doseeeses the inter
est of a novel. For this production be
was awarded costly gold medals by the
academies of science In both Philadel
phia and Paris. His writings on the
grasses of Texas Its minerals and its
agriculture bave been numerous and
valuable. For years be petitioned tbe
legislature to abolish punishment In
penitentiaries, and substitute enneroh-
lem as more efficacious.
In Mexico, be stated to Hon. John
H. Brown, that for fifty-eight years, at
daylight oa each Christmas morning,
be had stood In tbe door, barefooted,
In bis Blght-elothes, and played tbe
Oimjury system must be amended.
A qualification better and higher than
those now required of jurors is de
manded, and must be established. It
is shameful to see important questions
of law, involving the value of proper
ty, handed over too often to a lot of
seedy, needy fellows, some of whom
are in want and some incapable of re
sisting temptation and corruption. No
wonder verdlots are not always on the
side of justice. Where are the presl'
dents of banks and the railway mug-
nates 7 Where are the rich real estate
men, hotel keepers and merchants 7
Why do tbey never appear in the Jury
box 7 And hundreds of other wealthy,
able and well known citizens, why ore
so very, very few of them ever seen in
a jury box ? Almost all of them decry
the jury system, but they do nothing
to purify it. They shirk a duty they
should seek as a matter of conscience,
yet they leave it to unworthy hands
too often, not regarding the quiet,
stealthy injury their neglect is surely
working against the common good
The Jury system, that is, the mode of
selecting and qualification, must lie
amended so that the riff-ratf will be
kept out of the jury box.

GENERAL JOSEPH E. J0IIXS0X.
in English View of the Confederate
leader.
Review,
The great topic iu fushionuble radi
cal and colored circles is the impend
ing exodus of negroes from Alabama.
A convention of them was recently
held iu Montgomery, and an address
prepared (doubtless by some carpet
bagger who is going to make money
by moving them), setting forth their
"wrongs uuder kuklux hate and
white league proscription," which Is
addressed to the people of tbe United
States. They want assistance from the
north to help their emigration associa
tion effect their colouization in the far
west. It would'ut be a bad idea for con
gress to present them witli a territory
next to Utah, so that the two remnants
of "the twin relics of barbarism," the
negro and polygamy, can settle down
under their own viue aud fig tree away
from "de pore white rebel trash."
A new disease lias-appeared in New
York. It is culled thorisis und bus Its
origin lu dried sausage). The doctors
are puzzled and can't make it out.
The disease is one peculiarly to the
throat and is capable of producing
death. Many of the deaths attributed
to diptheria have been caused by it.
An examination with a microscope of
mucus from the throat of a patient
suffering with thorisis revealed thou
sands of insects called the myrmedon,
which died upon coming Into the air.
It was found tbe patient had been eat
ing a species of dried aattnage much in
form with Germans. An examination
of the sausage reveal myriads of the
same insect. The disease bears some
resemblance to trichiniosis, but onl
attacks the throat
It will be remembered that at a
meeting of republicans from northern
Texas, held in Tyler on the 14th of
November, to bring about a concert of
action to urge upon congress the loca
tion of a federal district court, to be
composed of that portion of northern
and northeastern Texas contiguous to
the Indian territory, and all, or parts
of such territory to which, by means of
the Missouri, Kansas and Texas road,
easy transit Is afforded. H. II Ray
aud A. B. Norton were the delegates
from Dallas county, and are on the
committee of correspondence. This is
the latest Intelligence on the subject
before us at present
Among the recent deaths in Alabama
was that of Colonel Francis Lee Camp
bell, a son of the late General Robert
Campbell, of South Carolina, formerly
United States consul at Havana and
London. Colonel Campbell com
manded tbe glorious old thirteenth
Louisiana, which won Imperishable
laurels In the campaigns of the army
of Tennessee. Colonel Campbell was
nearly related, on bis mother's side, to
General Robert E. Lee, being a great
grandson of Richard Henry Lee of Vir
ginia. He was a brave soldier and
hivalrous gentleman. Peace to bis
ashes.
Amono foreign items is tbe follow
ing: In Balfnrd a Roman Catholic
bishop la making an Innovation which
will surprise Protestants if not Roman
ists. He actually celebrated vespers
in tbe English language, and then
preached a sermon giving his reasons
for adopting this course. He aald be
hoped the congregation would all take
part, and make it a popular congrega
tional service, Instead of leaving It to
the clergy and choir, as bad been tbe
ease when the service was sung In

(From the London Saturday
Augunt 29.
The fame ol General Lee has so com
pletely oveashadowed that of all the
other military chiefs of tbe confederacy
that probably few or the Kuropean
public now remember that there was a
commander or tne army cnargea wun
the protection of the southern capital
before the great soldier who bas linked
his name in undying glory with the
defense of Richmond. And yet Gen
eral Joseph Johnson for, of course, it
is of him we speak gave evidence of
abilities that entitle mm to no mean
reputation as a strategist. On tbe field
of Bull Run he was the senior officer,
and as he was the first chosen to beat
back northern invasion, so, in the last
decisive struggle, wnen enerman Had
scattered the army of Georgia und was
beginning Ills famous march to the sea,
It was to jonnson again that tne con
federate government turned as the
only bj lwark of the Caroliuas. A his
tory from bis own pen, or, as he more
modestly styles it himself, a narrative,
of the military operations directed by
tills eminent soldier iu tbe greatest ot
modern civil wars, cannot but be highly
interesting to tne military student
lb a brief introduction of less than
three lines it is unpretendingly offered
as a contribution of materials for the
use of tbe future historian of tbe war.
It is written in the tone and spirit we
uliould expect from one who bud borne
himself so steadily against tremendous
odds. There is no vain boasting of the
superiority of the southern soldiers,
unit no disparagement or northern
courage. On the contrary, tbe general
goes out of his way on more than one
occasion to beur testimony to the gal
lantry of the foe. Aud when writing
in self defense for the book is essen
tially a defeuse of the general against
tue strictures passed upon niru he
never forgets the dignity that becomes
his character aud antecedents. At the
same time the fact that the work is an
apologia, a juftiHcation of bis inilittary
operatious, somewhat detracts fromthe
value; wniie tne omission to supply
maps very Beriously impairs its useful
ness. It is Impossible for a reader to
follow intelligently the details of a
.battle, aud of the movements which
preceded u, wimoui a plan oi me nein
before mm. And we would urge upon
the publishers .of the ".Narrative,"
when preparing for a second edition,
to supply this strange omission. Like
hie more famous chief, General Joseph
Johnson was a Virginian, and like
him. too. he held a commission iu the
ituited States army at the outbreak of
the war. General Johnson devotes a
brief space to Justify ills resignation of
his commission, and his passing over
to take service with tne confederacy.
Undoubtedly it Is a very grave step on
the part of a soldier to range himself
on the side or an Insurrection, and one
which 1b rightly judged on the most
rigorous principles. But the cases of
Generals Johnson and Lee are entirely
different from such a desertion as that
of the unfortunate Colonel Rossel, or,
indeed, from that of any officer in the
European army. Tbe result of the
civil war has decided now that a state
baa not the right to withdraw from the
Union. But when secession took place
that was not the received doctrine.
This is not the place to enter into the
pwmtitntinnnl arfrument, and, indeed,
it is sufficteht to remark that tbe whole
south repudiated the doctrine in the
most practical manner possible, while
iu tbe north the democratic party at
least openly maintained that the south
was acting within its right. If, then,
Generals Johnson and Lee erred, they
erred in common with the vast ma
jority of Americans in boldiug that a
state had the right to secede, aud that
to bis state a citizen owed His first al
legiance. As long as Virginia remain
ed lu tbe union both Ulcere retained
tbelr com missions and did their duty.
As soon as Virginia seceded both re
signed their commissions aud hastened
to place their services at the disposal of
their state. General Joseph Johnson
had been tbe senior in rank in the
United States army. At the time of
his resignation be was quartermaster
general, with the commission of a
brigadier general, whereas Lee was
only lieutenant oolouel. But on John
son's arrival in Richmond he found
that Lee bad been appoiuted commander-in-chief
of the army of the
state, with tbe rank of major geueraL
Johnson was at once given the same
rank, and entrusted with the training
of ttie state levies. On tbe accession
of Virginia to the confederacy, bow
ever, General Johnson entered the con
federate service, and received from
President Davis tbe command of Har
per's Ferry, while General Beauregard
was appointed to the confederate com
mand at Manassas, Lee still remaining
In the service of Virginia. The first
serious attack was made by tbe federal
army under General McDowell against
Manassas.' Johnston at once hurried
to the relief of Beauregard with a por
tion of his army, leavlug tbe remain
der to hurry after him as quickly aa it
could. He arrived In time to consult
with Beauregard, and agree to the plan
suggested by tbe latter. But before tbe
plau could be carried out, the federal
general attacked, and Bull Run was
the result This great victory secured
Virginia from invasion for the remain
der of the year. M'Clellan was appoint
ed to tbe command of the northern ar
my, and be devoted the autumn aud
winter to the work of properly organ
ising and disciplining it Early In tbe
following spring be moved bis forces
bv water to Fortress Monroe, and
tbenee advanced up tbe peninsula to
Invest Richmond. General Job ton
aseomed tbe direction of tbe operations
undertaken against btm. Johnston
strongly urged upon President Davis to
fall back upon Richmond, collect there
the whole military force of tbe confed
eracy, allow M'Uellaa to approach the
city, and then, when be was at a dis
tance from bis base, fall upon him, and
Inflict suck blow aa would decide tbe
war at one la favor oi tbe sooth.
AeeuBUfwrwa-d, ktwhtoh
Lee was present, and, mainly by Lee's
advice, aa Jolinnton Mates, the plan of
tbe latter was set aside. Under these
elrcuinstanoes General Johnston de
termined to deluy the advance of the
enemy by every means In his power,
without, however, bringing on a gen
eral engagement too soon. Accord
ingly he occupied In force a defensive
line constructed by General Magruder,
which stretched from Ynrktowu to
Warwlok Court Houbb. The line was
too long, and besides admitted of being
turned, but the federal general sal
down before It, and erected siege bat
teries. When they were ready, the
confederates retired. At Williamsburg
Longstreet's and Hill's division, to al
low lime for the removal or the hag
gage and ammunition, engaged a por
tion or the federal army, and innicted
a loss twice as great as these divisions
suffered themselves, and then the
army once more fell back slowly to the
neignrjornood oi Hionraond.
MoClellan's forces in their advance
were divided into two parts by the
Chickahorainy. Johnstou tookadvaut
age of the separation to direct twenty-
three out or his twenty-seven divisions
against the Federal left wing, consist
ing of two corps, or about two-fifths of
the entire federal force. The battle or
Seven Pines, which eusued, was tinde
oislve, as night fell before the confed
erates could prove the advantage they
gained, and General Johston having
received a severe wound, was never
able to resume the contest. A few
days later General Lee was appointed
to Ids command. Before Johnston
had completely recovered, he was or
dered to the west to superintend opera
tions in Mississippi aud Tennessee, but
want of means compelled him to look
on helplessly while General Grant re
duced Vicksburg aud Pemberton's
army.
The disasters experienced by General
Bragg next summoned him to the com
mand of the army of Tennessee. In a
campaign of seventy days, opposed to
an army under Sherman more than
twloe as numerous, Johnston boasts,
and the boost is corroborated by two of
his his corps commanders, that con
stantly fighting partial engagements,
and skirmishing day after day, believ
er lost an action, though he abandon
ed much territory, and banded over
the army to bis successor Improved iu
morale aud effectiveness. He adds that
he had brought the enemy to tbe neigh
borhood of the position where he iiad
intended to make a final stand, where
they would not be able to avail them
selves of their vuperiority of numbers,
where, If defeated, they would tie tar
from their base, and where, if he him
self su tiered a reverse, he had a strong
position to mil bacK upon. However,
the government was dissatisfied be
cause be retired persistently before
Sherman, mid lie was removed from
the command. He retired into private
life, whence he did not again emerge
until the army or the Tennessee had
been shattered to pieces under Hood,
and Sherman bad penetrated to the
heart of the confederacy. Then he
was once again summoned iuto the
field, but it was only to have tbe mel
ancholy honor of being tbe last south
ern general who surrendered an army
to the conqueror.

THE DUTY OF TUG HOUR.
Texas bas made heroic efforts for.
years to fill up its vast, beautiful and
fertile territory, and to develop Its im
mense resources which, when accom
plished, will place us as fur ahead of any
other state in the union, in point of
wealth and political power, that we
have' nt room here to figure it up. We
are happy to state that those efforts
are being crowned with that success of
which they are so imminently worthy.
Hundreds of Intelligent and honest
people are dally pouring into its con
fines. The tide of eramigration to tbe
west bas at last turned la this direc
tion, but there still remains much to
be done to complete this victory, and
we cannot think that the task is une
qual to the men who have already
done so much uuder many more seri
ous disadvantages. Our cities must be
built up by manufactories of every
description, else that vast amount of
money realized from tbe products will
go to fill the coffers of St Louis aud
other large manufacturing cities. The
press wields tbe greatest power, both
at borne and abroad, . but Its power
ceases when its patronage stops. Your
papers must be liberally supported by
subscription and advertisements at
home. .No danger, then, of its finding
patronage abroad.
Remember that people always see
the Journals of a city before It sees the
city, aud by It the city Is invariably
judged. Let them see a live paper
and they at once conclude It emanates
from a go-ahead community. A few
old fogies In business might ruin a
whole city. They derange, confuse
and smother their own and their
neighbor's trade. Shrewd business
men, therefore, prefer good to bad
competitors In trade. ' Renew your
vigor and capitalists will flock to your
city and in a few years Dallas will teem
with factories of every description,
your stores be filled with customers and
your property greatly enhanced In
value. Dallas bas many advantages In
location, etc, and bas greatly out
grown ber sister cities, but without
proper vigilance some other city may
yet snatch your large and fast Increas
ing trade from you.

The Teaaa and I'arllle In I'tiiigreaa,
The bill now before congress author
l.lng the government to endorse til
bonds of thu Texas uuil 1'nolflc rallwa
for forty thousand dollars a mile,
exchange for a mortgago on all th
hinds and property of the company
will be reported from the committee
about the first of February. A special
to the Galveston News gives the result
of an Interview with one of the road'
friends, who is very confident of
favorable action by congress. He
says "that the bill was strong on Its
merits. It was an act of juctlce to the
south, giving that section assistance to
enable it to reach tho Pacific count, al
though the aid proposed was much less
vuluuhle than that giveu to the north
On this aecntiut It would receive the
solid southern vote aud substantial
support from fuir minded northern
representatives. In the next place,
the construction of the road would do
much to revive the prostration of the
industry of the country, und this urgu-
meut hud already proven edectual with
several members representing Iron-pro-
duclng districts. He counted on
heavy vote from Pennsylvania on this
account, as well as on account of the
controlling influence exercised by Col
onel Thomas A. Scott over members
from that state, with the south a unit
for tbe bill, bucked by Pennsylvania
and the Pacific coast, he believed there
would be uo trouble to pick up enough
members here and there in other states
to make a majority. Once through
the house there would be no difficulty
On the other hand, the northern Pa
ciflc will urge its friends to vote for the
Texas Pacific, which will give it. some
strength In the northwest. The seuute
had long bceu ready to pass the bill
whenever friends of roads desired.
A special from Washington snys
the present calm in congress undoubt
edly precedes a storm, und it is believ
ed that in less thau a week the repub
lican party will make the attempt to
consummate measures designed to pro
duce conflict aud possibly civil war in
the south. The civil rights bill, which
was evaded ut the last session of con
gress, is now to be employed for the
nefarious purpose. The judiciary com
mittee has appointed a sub-committee
to draft a bill, the provisions of which
will enforce, by severe penalties, the
social equality of the races iu hotels,
una, restaurants, railroads, steamboats
and all public conveyances and places
of public amusement. The leaders have
probably ascertained that Grant would
sign such a bill. If tha execution of
the measure should provoke a war of
races at the south, It will be just whut
the radical leaders desire. Their idea
is that this will save their party.

A New York exchange reports :
During the week past two important
cases have been decided In tbe court of
appeals. The first was tbe cose of the
Marine National bank of tbe city of
New York against tbe National City
bank of New York, 'and the second
that of the bank of North America
gainst the National bank of the Com
monwealth. Both suits were brought
to recover sums paid out on checks
certified by the tanks complaining,
and are considered important as likely
to affect a loose and dangerous practice
which bas become common among
operators In ths money market
Tbe court decides iu both eases that
the certification of a check by a bank
Is simply the recognition of the signa
ture thereto, aa that of a person or firm
having an account with aud fuuda in
the bank to which tbe check is sub
mitted to be certified; that the money
was obtained under misrepresentation,
aud that the Judgment entered un tbe
report of the referee, directing that the
plaintiffs should be repaid the differ
ence claimed, be affirmed with costs.

Edwin Booth is represented to bo in
a bud state of depression, aud almost
despair, on account of the sale of his
magnificent theater to the chiet or its
mortgagees. His heart had become
wrapt upin the just pride of owning tbe
noblest building of its kind in the coun
try, und keeping it iealously for the
truo drama. Now he refuses to be con
soled, and seems hardly the same man.
let Mr. Booth lias, one would think,
as much reason to relolco as to regret.
Ho is freed from it burden his nature
never fitted him to bear, and now is
left free to uet, earn lilsincnmeof S100,-
000 a year, invest its surplus, and grow
ricli in the udmiratiou and tbe money
of his country. Oliver Ames, tbe new
proprietor of tho theater, has paid In
the aggregate 301,000 for what cost
$800,(100, and vulues the property uow
ut S400,0oo, a gum on which the theater
and other rentable space can easily pay
the interest. Of course it is a doubtful
inestion whether, under the owner
ship of u money maker likes Ames
und manager like Jarrett & Palmer,
the lofty ambitions of Mr. Booth in re
gard to the drama will be respected.

Tho writer suggests that the inaislini's
celebration of marriages bad better be
kept a secret from the English, for he
fears that many a couple might repair
to Creisau in lieu of Gretna-Ureen of
the abolition of which he doe not
