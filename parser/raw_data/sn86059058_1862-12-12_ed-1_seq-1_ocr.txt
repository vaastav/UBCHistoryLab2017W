From the Cincinnati Price Current, 10th.
Financial and f oinmcrolal Summarj
for the Past Week.
There lias been an active demand for
moiinv, but none of that stringency
which has prevailed during the pork sea
son in other vears exists in the market,
and all acceptable paper offered has
been taken at 10 per cent,.; but iu some
i cases 12 per cent, had to be paid. The ;
week closed with a slight falling off in the ;
demand, however, and an easier market.
The minds of those who deal iu money '
and public securities have been a good '
deal agitated by the President's Message j
and tiie reports of the Secretary of the
Treasury and the Secretary of War, and
the price of gold and public securities has
flaetmted, to a considerable extent; and
gold closes higher. The truth is, mat
ters do not look so well cither in the field
or the Ciiliinet. The revelations made ,
in the report of the Secretary of War,
are discouraging in the extreme; for if
it is true, that in Union there is strength,
then the converse of this expresses the
position of the affairs of the Nation. It
seems to be an admitted fact that com
petition and jealousies, personal dislikes
and personal malignity, hud culminated j
in positive mutiny on the part of some,
if not all the leaders of the army in Vir
ginia, and disobedience ot orders of su- ;
perior oflicers had become the rule, al
most; and such conduct passed unno- :
ticed, in many cases. A change has ta
ken place, it is true, but this change finds
us in midwinter, when a successful cam
paign seeids extremely difficult, if not
impossible. It is these things which are
malting gold go up, and producing agi-'
tatio.i in financial matters in the leading
mnrkels.
Exchange on New York and the other !
Eastern cities was a shade firmer at the '
close, and dealers generally bought at J
discount and sold at par. The quota- i
tions for coin and exchange a the close, j
last evening, were as follows:

Demand Xotes 'in prem.
The weather has been cold and frosty
and as favorable tor pork packing as
could have been desired. The receipts
of hogs have been large, but the demand
has been fully equal to them, and prices
gradually improved. The receipts are
now greater, up to this date, than in any
previous season, but the impression is
that, owing to the high price of corn,
farmers are hurrying their hogs to mar
ket, and that the season will close eurlier
than usual. The fact that hogs are not
as well fatted as they might be, seems to
corroborate this theory. It seems quie
probable, however, that the number of
hogs which will be packed here the
present season will exceed the number
packed last season, very considerably.
There can be no doubt that the number
of hogs in the country is large, and that
the average weight will be up to the
usual average of other seasons, not mak
ing that of last season as the standard.
Yesterday packers were well supplied.
Generally speaking, they were not iu the
market, which gave it rather a quiet as
pect; but it was none the less firm, and
prices were fully maintained, the range
being '!' to &4 6" for hogs averaging
170 to 200 lbs. The sales were:

Extra heavy hogs were scarce, and
anxiously sought for at 4 60 to $4 65.
The receipts during the week anil for
the season, and comparatively, for some
previous seasons, were as follows:

The market for the hog product has
been moderately active. Old mess
pork has been held at $11, and new,
which has been packed to some extent,
at $12 50 to $13, but there have been no
sales of importance.
Lard has been in good demand at Of,
in tierces, and 0 in kegs, but a portion
of the time it is held higher, and at this
close, it would have heen difficult to buy
at the quotations, owing to the advance
in New York. This seems to be a favor
ite article, and outsiders are buying it
on speculation to a considerable extent.
Manufacturers are buying freely, and
paying 8J8J for head and gut
Green meats have been in good de
mand, as regards sides and hams, but
shoulders have not been bought freely.
We quote shoulders at 3J3J, which is
above the views of buyers a shade; sides
55i for rib and clear, and hams 5(7i)
b, the latter rate for light The de
mand for light hams has been active and

A fair business has been done in box
meuts at 6j(S;7e for short clear and mid
dles, 6k for short rib, 6c for long do, and
5 J Co 5 for Cumberland. One of the
English packers sold largely in X-w

FRIDAY MORNING,
did not hear of any transactions in old
meats, either in bulk or smoked.
There has not been much animation in
the market for flour and grain. Whisky
ruled firm at 3-. Cooperage and coop
ers' stuff dull, and, in some articles of
the former, lower.
The grocery market continues exceed
ingly dull, and prices of sugar and mo
lasses very irregular, so much so that
anything like accurate quotations cannot
be given. Holders seem anxious to re
alize, but the demand is of the most lim
ited nature. The quotations, so far as
they can be given, will be found in our
market report.
Salt is dull and prices declining. Liv
erpool sold at $2 252 50 per bag. and
Turk's Island at 55c. Kanawha is down
to 62J for the inside lots, but outside lota
are ottered at 55c. The demand for all
