"Washington-, Dec. 5.— second
session of the Forty-ninth congress will be-
Kin at noon to-morrow. Alter prayer and
roll-call each house will appoint a com
mittee to inform the other of its readiness
to proceed to business. The new members
who are to fill the vacancies caused by
death and resignation will then be sworn
in. Upon the completion of the formal
organization a joint committee will wait
upon the president to inform him that a
quorum of each house is assembled, and j
that congress is ready to receive any com
munication he may be pleased to make.
The president's annual message will then !
be received, and after its reading the
formal announcement in the senate of the
death of Senator Pike, and in the house of
representatives Beach and Arnot, will be
made, followed immediately by adjourn
ment, out of respect to their memory. The
legislative business of the session is ex
pected to begin Tuesday. The unfinished j
business of the senate is a vetoed private
pension bill, reported from the committee
ou pensions, with a recommendation that it
be passed over the veto. The hrst of the
special orders is the Pacific railroad funding ;
bill, which has been at the head of the
calender since last May. It is not known
whether Mr. Hoar, who has it iv charge,
will
PRESS IT FOR CONSIDERATION
at once or Buffer it to be overruled. Senator
Piatt's resolution for the consideration of
executive nominal in open session is a j
special order for Wednesday, and its con- !
sideration will be urged without further j
delay. With these three exceptions no )
measure of the calendar is in a position to ;
command the attention of the senate dur- ;
ing the week, the remaining noecial orders
being assigned to days of the following j
week. The calendar contains 200 bills and i
resolutions, from which number a majority
of the body w.ll make its selection for con- '
sideration. There is a prospect of an early
agreement by the conferees upon the inter
state commerce bill. It is hardly probable ]
that any business of consequence will be
transacted in the house of representatives
during the early pert of the week. A j
privileged report may be presented to the I
bouse by the conferees on the fortification j
appropriation bill, which
FAILED OF ENACTMENT
last session by reason of the total disagree
ment of the conferees, in which event a
new conference will be ordered. The ap
propriation committee has made such pro
gress in the preparation of the sundry civil j
appropriation bill that it is believed this :
measure can be reported to the house about I
the middle of the week. If the temper of J
that body proves favorable the bill can be
taken up for immediate action and fair pro- i
gress made by the end of the week. Sev- j
eral measures of interest were made con- j
tinning separate orders at the last session i
and may be called up at any time if the !
house is so disposed. . They are the free
ship bill, the electoial-count bill, the Pacific '
railroad funding bilL the Washington. Da- \
kota and Oklahoma territorial admission !
bills, the array re-organization bill, and j
sundry bills of minor importance reported •
from the committees on labor, ways and
means, banking and currency, agriculture \
and Indian affairs. The unfinished busi- j
ness for the morning hours, if the house
decides to follow the routine, is the b.ll to j
indemnify the Chinese sufferers by the
Pock Springs massacre. Next in order on
the callendar is the bill providing for the I
construction of the Hennepin canal.

Washington. Dec. s.— The United
States treasurer has submitted to the sec- ;
retary his annual report, from which it ap
pears that the net receipts of th govern
ment during the year ended June 30, ViiM.
were 503 C.459.727, and the net expendi
tures 534-. 4-3. 138. The excess of revenue
over expenditure was 593.956.589. The
receipts were £12, 749,030. 68 greater and
the expenditures were £17.743.796.61 less
than last year, making an increase in the
net receipts for the past fiscal year over
that of ISSS of $30,492.-17.29. The re
ce'pts on account of the postuffice
department not included in the
above statement amount to £52.
--997.135, an increase of $5,687 399
over those of the preceding year. The ex
penditures increased trot" 850.396.31. in
I_S5 to 555.653.585 in 1886, or 5365.27 L
Bonds of the United States amounting to
$44,531,350 were redeemed and applied to
sinking funds. Coupons from bonds
amounting to 57.557.45-. were paid by the
assistant treasurers. Interest amounting to
£42.498,0-7 was mid on registered bonds of
the United States, including the bonds
issued to the various Pacific railroad com
panies. Coupons from the 3.05 per cent,
bonds of the District of Columbia amount
ing to §105.441 were paid, and registered
interest amounting to £416.44. was paid.
Of bonds heid by the treasurer of the
United States in trust for national banks.
501.042.400 were withdrawn, of which
amount $56,9-5.300 was held
TO SECURE CIRCULATION
and 54. 117. 100 was held as security for de
posits of public moneys. The bonds de
posited to replace those withdrawn on ac
count of circulation amounted to £20,754,
--900, and tin account of deposits to SO. 170.
--000. making a total decrease of 834. 117,500
in the bonds held by the treasurer for na
tional banks. The total amount of bonds
held for national banks was §87.967.300.;
Worn and mrtilated United States notes i
amounting to S-J3.000.0C0 were forwarded
to the treasury for redemption during the
year, and new notes to a like amount were
issued in place thereof. The issue of silver
certificates during the year amounted
to §4.800.000. and 7 28,5'_J3.971 were
redeemed. The amount of credit of dis
bursing officers of the government on the
books of the treasury at the close of the
year was §17.947.107. of which 510.331.354
was on deposit in the treasury, and §2,
--615,753 in the national bank depositories.
The unavailable funds of the treasury on
June 30. lf'bo, were S-9 521.397. a decrease
of 53,9-46 from last year. The balance in
the treasury at the close of the year ending
Sept. 30. 1886, was §100,055.775. an in
crease over that of I&SS of 816.815.636.
The available balance was 913.141,
against 550.922.191 last year, an increase
of §13,990.949. The treasurer calls atten
tion to tbe large sums
HELP BY MINTS
and assay offices, and suggests that the coin
held by tbem be placed in the actual cus
tody of the treasury, and the duties of the
mint officers be confined to the assaying
and coinage of the bullion placed in their <
charge. The present method of examina- i
tion of the sub treasury, he says, is very
unsatisfactory, and an appropriation should
be made which would enable the treasurer
to put these offices in good condition, and
thus render the work of annual examination
more thorough but less costly hereafter.
He says that alterations in the present sub
treasury system are rendered necessary by
*■»« financial changes which have taken
i '"- r ; "•-;
place since it was adopted. On this sub- 7
; ject he says: : * .;
i As the country Increases In wealth and' 7 :
} poDulation. with the consequent increase of :
Its revenues and disbursements, it will bo
found ia_'>o-ss'!.e to continue the system in
its present form. With the extinction of tho
3 per cent, bonds, which without some de
pression or event that cannot now be fore
i seen, must take place* durintr the ensuing,
i fiscial year, the only bonds available lor the
purposes of the shi-imr fund will lie tbo
i^i and 4 per cent, bunds. These are now
selling at a price which averages very little
more thiin 2 per cm. per annum to the pur
chasers upon the cost, and it may fairly ho
I assumed that this rate of 2 per cent, la the
maximum rate to be earned durini. thy life
of these bonds. At present the cost of the
collection of the revenue of the couutry, Is
53.70 per $100,
T' S OS
on the existing sinking: funds, say $45,000,000
per annum, will be $765,000 annually, assum
ing _ percent, as the best rate which the
bonds can earn. Without discussing tho
consequent passlMe derangement of our ex
• istinjr financial - st 'ins, if the purchases for
j the sinking fund are to be maintained at
j their present figures, it will be found to be j
I impracticable to make these purchases at
. such times and in such manner as to relieve
the money market in times of financial dis
i tress. As these derangements happen almost
j invariably at the lime of the moving of the
I crops of the country, this state_ient is equiv
, aleut to saying that every productive interest
• in this country must pay toll to foreign buy
j ers through the lower ranue of prices which
obtain at such times because of the
; fact that our arrangements for collecting
I and disbursing our revenues are so defective
as to need an artificial remedy in order to
; place in active circulation ih i moneys with- ;
■ drawn from the business of tbe country, j
This method of dealing with the public |
7 moneys is cot true of any other country but j
this, and the practical sense of the American j
j people.as shown through their representatives
:in congress, should be adequate to find a
! remedy for this constant y recurring evil,
I one sure to grow and become more burden
! some in our future national history. This
| remedy should be lound and adopted with the
I coming session of congress, because the evil |
j complained of will he upon the United States '
i before its next mi .dug, and the treasury j
: left witbout any means of supplying the >
I urgeut needs of the country.
TABLES are given
| showing the former and the proposed man- '
i ncr ut estimating the sinking fund charge !
j for the fiscal year 1887. and it is suggested j
! that the old method of making up the fund
I be rev'.sed. and the annual payments on ac- I
count of this fund be made in accordance j
; with the new form. The treasurer says
; that by the present method the entire debt j
! will be ret. red by the year 1900. If the j
1 proposed method be adopted the debt will j
be extinguished by the year 1913. The j
total amount of United States notes out- J
standing at the close of the ri_cal year was |
53_6.661.01g. Compared with 188*-;
there was outstanding an increased i
amount of five and one -thousand -dollar !
notes, and a decreased amount of !
notes of all denom nations. The fives
increased from 371.150.080 to 597.990.310. j
and the one-thousand-dollar notes from !
•514.328.000 to -.3-3. 000. The ones de- ;
creased from $37,736,457 to -14.319.235. ;
and the twos from 8*35.524.395 to 514.935,-
SIS. The treasurer again calls attention to
the fact that in the so-called '"reserve
vault" Pcs 5147,595.00 i) of paper money j
prepared for issue
WITHOUT AUTHORITY
of law. and he advises the legislation to i
permit of its legal disposition. The ,
treasurer also caiis attention to the j
large amount of certificates of j
deposit furnished national banks
and says this is done at considerable ex
pense and risk and without auy benefit to j
the government. The treasurer devotes
considerable space to the subject of silver '
certificates and standard silver dollars. The '
amount of silver certificates nominally out- !
standing at the close of the fiscal year was |
Silo.'*'. ..*~5. of which amount the treasury
held $27,801,450. leaving ,88.116.225 in j
actual circulation, a deeie_se of 513.441.781
during the year. The amount nominally !
outstanding on June 30, 1886, has since j
been added to by the demands of reviving'
business to the extent of $3,689 4 - 27. The !
amount held by the treasury decreased to .
$14,137,285. and the amount in circulation j
Nov. SO is 6105,518.817 at the close of 1885,
with an actual circulation of 8101,530.946
of silver certificates. The custom house j
receipts of this kind of money at New
York were 35.6 per cent ot the total re- <
ce'pts at that point. At present, with a i
circulation of 3105.519. 817, with larger :
customs receipts, the percentage received j
!at New York was 12 per cent. Several I
tables are given to show the amount of
standard silver dollars coined, on baud, dis
tributed and outstanding atthe cios^of
each year since the coinage began. From,
them it appears that there is now m circu
lation 501.041.448. being the largest sum yet
attained in the circulation of this kind of
currency. •

Man that wanted an office is of many
days and full of trouble. A man named
Yoiii-uns. from New Orleans, has written
to a Washington paper to procure him a
lawyer to collect what he thinks the gov
ernment owes him on account of not get
ting an office, lie says he was clearly en- '
titled to an office as early 18 1879. and
therefore ought to have pay to the amount
of 382.875. for seven years, seven mouths ,
and a half of enforced idleness. He reveals
the fact that there has been a vile j !
conspiracy to deprive him of his constitu- j
tional right to obtain office, and he demands j ,
wages for what the printers call "standing j ,
rime." or for work that he did not have a j !
chance to-do. It is a sad case. The gov- I '
eminent ought to appoint to oifice all who j '■.
want office, and it ought to pay them big I
wages for six hours'work a day for every; j
body knows that the treasury is running ,
over, that the government is as rich as ten j
thousand Ciu.su.ses, and has a mortgage on j
both time and eternity. It will, perhaps,
comfort tiiis New Orleans complainant to '
know that there are a million or more peo- :
ple in the country in the same boat with '
him. and they have been persecuted in the j
same way. Some of them have much j
greater grievances even than Youmans, for
they were not appointed to office when I
they wanted to be even so long ago as ten j
or fifteen years. They should all pool their
issues and go for the treasury. It would |
knock the surplus sky high, would necessi- I
tate the raising of the tariff and wipe the j
floor with the pauper labor of Europe. All I
the would-be officeholders would build tine j
bouses, start newspapers, ride in special i
trains, and business would boom with a
tremendous 250 horse-power, compound, '.
double-acting, surface-condensing boom.

Chicago, Dec. 5. — Henry Schwartz,
formerly of Philadelphia, now in the county
jail here charged with bigamy, is strongly
suspected of beine the man guilty of the
daring robbery of the Rock Island express
train last March, when Kelio__ Nichols, the
express messenger, lost his life and 837.000
was stolen from the press car Schwartz
for two years has been a brakeman on the
Rock Island road. Friday night as he came
into the depot with his train an officer took
him by the arm and marched him to the
Harrison street station. Yesterday he was
arraigned for having married a wife in
Philadelphia seven years ago and with hav
ing married a Chicago woman two years
ag >. At his own solicitation his case was
continued in $1,000 bail until Dec. 14. At
first he maintained a dodged silence, but
now volubly alleges that the Rock Island
company does not care whether he has one
wife or a hundred if he or some one else
can be sent to the penitentiary for the rob
bery of the express car. He confesses that
he. has spent much more money than he
earned or could have received from home,
but he is not ready to tell where the money
came from. As a brakeman, Schwartz was
one of the crew on
THE ILL FATED TRAIN
to which Messenger Nichols' car was at
tached. No suspicion was directed toward
him at the time. When, in compliance
with telegraphic instructions, Schwartz was
returning to Chicago to attend the inquest,
the conductor of the train found in the toilet
room of the car in wh.ch Schwartz was ]
seated a black handbag which some one had
tried to force down the closet seat. It was
empty, but st.ckiug in the fold of the cloth
was a piece of what looked like a part of a
check. Schwartz was noticeably confused
oy the discovery. Various minor circum- ,
stances pointed to him as the ownet of the ;
bag. Subsequent investigation showed j
that the torn bit of paper fitted into a mv- ■
tilated check that was among the scattered
contents of the rifled express safe. From ;
that tune Schwartz was shadowed day and .
night. He was spending with a lavish
hand. The money stolen from the express
car was mostly in bills of large demonina- ]
turns, and about 83.000 in 850 bills that
Schwartz had spent here and in the East
were obtained by the detectives^ From the
tirst it has been conceded that the crime
was committed by a railroad man. Now
the railway and express officials hope that
the mystery of the cold-blooded murder and
daring robbery is soon to be cleared away.

Philadelphia, Dec. 5. — The Record j
to-morrow will say: "Following close upon
the announcement that O' Donovan Rossa
had been deposed from the leadership of
the extreme Irish. in New York comes
the rumor, seemingly well founded, that
he has formed an alliance with
the Fenians of Philadelphia. who
have been cut off from the
parent body. It has beeu learned that a
secret Meeting was held in tins city on
Thanksgiving day for the purpose of per
fecting the organization of the new body.
There were present at the meeting about
twenty-five delegates, each of whom
claimed to represent a division. An excit
ing session resulted. After a lengthy de
bate it was found to be practically impos- j
sible to unite upon a chief who should be I
the ruling spirit. Finally it was decided
to take up a man from the out
side whom it was thought could
unite the factions, and who would
at the same time tally represent the idea of
the new government It was stated that
.'Donovan severed his connection with the
extremists in New York. The expediency
of calling him to the position was received
favorably by about three-fourths of the
delegates. A portion of the revised pro
gramme includes secret intrigues in the
Canadian government to the end that the
people of Canada may become discontented
and throw off England's authority alto
gether. if it is shown that there is
a possibility of success, emissaries are to
be sent to Australia with the same purpose
iv view. The pet doctrine of Rossa is not,
however, to be abandoned by any means.
In order to satisfy the Philadelphia chiefs,
places have been given them in the execu
tive body. It is reported . that Harry
O'Connor has been made secretary and
Luke Dillon has been put at the head of
the organization staff. James McDermot,
Ryan and Dillon, with Rossa as ex-ollicio
chairman, ate to constitute the revolution

Nooales. Ariz.. Dec. 5. — Much excite
ment was created here by the report of the
arrest of Mexican editors who are in oppo
sition to Torres, the present governor of
Sonera, Hex. The governor has
had a stiff fight on his hands
.jver since he assumed the office, and the
opposition was a formiable one. It has
been known for some time that a fierce
political tight would result, but better in
formed Mexicans, either through prejudice
or political feeling, agreed that a revolu
tion would characterize the coining
campaign. This feeling, however,
has been dispelled by the action of
the government. Last evening, by order
of the government. David Oviedo, Alex
ander Wallace and Miguel Campillo. edit
ors of the Spanish "paper called El !
Sorense. published in Gnaymas. were j
placed under arrest and taken to Hermo
sillo, where they were lodged in
jail. At the same time Augustine
Pasquerea and J. M. Saleido, editors
of El Pueblo, a newspaper published in
Lleruiosilio. were arrested and lodged in
jail. The charge against these gentlemen
is opposition to the state government. The
news of this onslaught of the state govern
ment was received here by a telegram to the
prefect of Nogales. and is consequently re
liable. Grave complications are antici
pated.

Chicago. Dec. 5.- The following crop
summary will appear in this week's issue of
j the Farmers' Review: The report from the

Michigan. Indiana, Illinois. Missouri and
Kansas continue to be generally favorable
for the fall-sown grain. Three counties in
Kansas report the plant as looking
poorly. In St. Joseph county, Michigan,
the presence of the fly is noted, with the
statement that many of the fields are look

| especially from Missouri, the reports thus
far are of a very flattering character.
The movement of corn is re

Northwest This is especially true of lowa,
j Nebraska and Wisconsin, with only a
I moderate movement in Minnesota and
j Dakota. In Mc Henry. Mercer and Monroe
j counties, of Illinois, it is reported that
; there is no corn to ship. A similar report
■ is made as to Decatur, Jefferson. Keokuk,

in some instances corn is being imported.
The movement is reported as only moderate

Washington. Dec. 5. — The aristocracy
I of Washington has been stirred to its depths
|by an elopement. Miss Katherine Francis,
a beautiful, full-lipped brunette belle of
colored society, lias deceived her papa, her
mamma and her lover. Mr. Francis is a
lamous and wealthy colored gentleman,
who has been a mixer of cock-tails at Han
cock's curiosity shop for years, and later
at the senate restaurant. He has been in
dustrious and thrifty in the business and
i has amassed a fortune of several hundred
! dollars. He stands well in colored society.
j His willful daughter was engaged to be
I married to a gentleman of quality, who
| waits on a table at a prominent hotel, and
t they do say he is a good waiter. The
; waiter rented and furnished an elegant
i mansion of diminutive proportions, and
I had the day set for the ceremony which
■ would make him
THE HAPPIEST Of COONS.
Mr. Waiter sent out his invitations, and
j among others mailed one to a barber in New
i York, who used to reside in this city and
; wield his scepter over the faces of congress
• men in the house shop. He had known and
| loved Miss Francis. His love awakened
anew. He came to Washington and. like
voting Lee-invar, he carried away the .
bride. It is a highly sensational affair, and
colored society is all agog about it. The
brother of Miss Francis is a very prominent j
physician in the West end. and is very in
dignant with his sister's unique matrimonial
venture. It is said that the eloping bride
left a note for her groom-expectaut, saying:
"1 may be a widow some day. Then i will
marry you. You are a good waiter. You i
i can wait." \
Senator Van Wyck, of Nebraska, is here, I
and seems more baggy at the knees than
formerly. Senator Butler, the wag of the
senate, says that Van Wyck wears baggy
pants to prevent people from seeing how
much disagreement there is between his
knees. They never come into contact with
each other, and are uot ou speaking ac
quaintance. However, the senator's ideas I
i are
NOT BOW-LEGGED
j by any means, and' he is one of the most j
j entertaining conversationalists La the city.
I vV.thont any pretense to homeliness, he i
! manages to be as unlike Apollo as possible '
in appearance, but as Cliestertieldian in I
! -tanner as Chesterfield himself. The ladies
' ike him. and will seek his society in pref
! erence to that of handsomer men for the
■ sake of hearing his unique expressions and
; contortioual each. nations of narration. A
' young lady was airing her French at the
! White house one afternoon recently, and
i talked with a visiting trend of a member
•of the French legation. The French lady
: spoke English with a very pretty accent, ;
i out uer construction of sentences was any- i
, ning but correct. The youijg Washing
! tonian conversed in fair French, and finally |
• asked the Parisian why she spoke in En- j
: _*ljsh when she could as well use her mother ;
j tongue. Her reply was: 'I could not be ;
• no impolite as to use a foreign language in
tie house of your president, even if 1 had
; to keep
ENTyiEIiY QUIET.
' which ladies do not like to do." The re- j
| buke was so delicate, yet so pointed withal, '
; that the young iady will probably leave her
I French at home hereaft w lieu she goes to
; a White house reception. "The Salvation
, army is a regular sour mash distillery."
says one of the young mashers of this city.
! "When you go into the barracks all of the
| girls look sour and sited. Just befoie the :
services close they get the vinegar out of i
; their faces, and begin to smile and look j
: around like young husband hunters at a ;
• country singing school. Their grins and
| smiles are broad and open as churcii doors, ;
I and their glances are as bright and sug- !
gestive as Venus ever shot at Adonis. .
; With the last hallelujah chorus the mash- \
'■ ing process begins. I have made more
mashes at tiie Salvation barracks, ana dur
: ing the knee drills, than anywhere else in
! Washington. And the young scape grace
! adjusted his tie and went gaily forth more
• hearts to crush. One of the most
! BEAfTIFUI. AND POP-LAB
j lades of our haut tun has become infatuated
j with Prof. C. The great mesmerist has
■ gained such complete possession of the
! young lady that she not only goes upon tha
! stage at every performance, but lias called
|at his hotel several times to see him. The
j professor has kindly told the parents of the
i young lady of her conduct and request
i them to look after her during IPs stay in the
! city. It seems that on the evening of his
tirst performance the young lady was one of
: the number who went upon the stage when
: volunteers were called for. and the mesmer
! ist made his subjects go through a love
'■ scene in which they became very affec
tionate and proposed marriage and all that
sort of thing, greatly to the amusement of
I the. audience. When the others were re
j covered and dismissed, the young lady re
i fused to leave the stage, and. flinging her
| arms around the neck of the professor,
j told him that she loved him and would die
: without him. and ail that sort of
lovers' talk.
Her brother came upon the stage and com
pelled her to go home with him. The pro
fessor was evidently not blamable for the
exceedingly sensitive character of his sub
ject, and no censure is cast upon him. But
the circumstance is such a peculiar one that
it would be well for young ladies to bear it
jin mind and beware of mesmerists. It will
be iuteiesting to ladies to know that the
question of "whether Methodists can dance
has been finally 'settled. The Methodist
church has a strong hold in the Northwest,
and when the snow lies snugly to the
ground and revivals and balls are in season,
! it is important for the good youug people to
! know what is the proper caper. One round
dozen of Methodist preachers have been in
terviewed by their congregations, or mem
bers of their churches, on the subject of
dancing, and they have finally decided it.
Six of the clergymen decide that no one can
go to heaven who dances. Six others have
decided that "there is
NO HARM IN DANCING,
unless it be carried to excess." It has been
agreed by all the young ladies that the
better half of the preachers have struck the
right gait, and that it is right to dance. •
They have all decided not to dance to ex- |
cess, and therefore balls will catch more of i
them than revivals. As soon as the month
of official mourning for the ex-president is
past Mrs. Cleveland has promised the ladies
of the cabinet that she will plan and par
i ticipate in many festivities of the season.
The state dinners, public receptions aud [
official hospitalities which are necessary to ••
her position will be supplemented with
many gayetes, which will not only do j
honor to the personal friends who will visit ;
Mrs. Cleveland from her old home, but
also do credit to the wife of the president
as well as to his administration. Society \
has made many a man great and it has
mademtuy a great man small. Martin
Vau Buren became president because he j
stood by Margaret Eaton in her social war '-.
w.th the ladies of the cabiuet of Andrew .
Jackson. Mr. Cleveland may be made
even greater than he is by the social ability
of his bride, just as Logan looms loftily by ,
reason of the greatness of the social power
of his magnificent wife.
BUSS MAY C ADMAN,
the pretty niece of Mrs. Folsom, resides
with the president's mother-in-law at Oak
View, the Cleveland country cottage. Miss
May drives into the city every day to school,
and Mrs. Folsom remains at the View. It
is beginning to be talked about that the
president has banished his mother-in-law.
just like ordinary men. But Mrs. Cleve
land is almost a daily visitor to her mother,
aud the ladies take walks and drives in the
country out around and beyond Fort Reno.
When Mrs. Cleveland is unable to visit her
! mother they say that the telephone at the
j White house is busy all day long and the
1 mother and daughter use it. The recep-
I tions, or "at homes." on Friday afternoons
! are becoming just the thing. G street,
I from the war department to the observa
i tory hill, is lined with equipages from noon
j until late in the evening. X street is also
! taking on a lively air. and the road to Oak
i View is a cloud of dust on Friday. Mrs.
: Justice Matthews receives twice each week..
and is assisted by her really charming
; daughter. Miss Genie. Two younger ladies
i are "coming out" this season, and Mr. Paul
Matthews has been here nearly two weeks
, on a sort of
furlough FROM college.
One of his young lady admirers said last
evening, "My, how hard poor Paul will
' have to study to catch up. after this round
,of dissipation." Quite true. Poor Paul
will have to buy an extra "pony" and hire
an extra tutor to coach him up for the fall
examinations. Mrs. Justice Miller is also
! receiving twice a week and" is assisted by
; her grand-daughter, , Miss Lucy Corkhill,
j the daughter of the late United States dis
; trict attorney. Miss Corkhill is a very
bright young lady, and has decided vocal
: talents. She is very like her distinguished
father. Mrs. Miller, although a grand
mother, is as sprightly and winsome and
quick at repartee as when, thirty years ago,
I she was the queen of social life at the capi
• tal of lowa. Secretary and Mrs. Whitney
have been entertaining Minister Baron and
j Madame Reuterskiold at their country
place. Grasslands. for several days recently.
Wednesdays and Saturdays are the days
! fixed upon for the receptions of the
LADIES OF THE CABINET
and White house. The leaders of domestic
Washington society have concluded that it
j Would be "bad form" for them to receive
I on those days, and hence, their houses are
: closed, even to intimate friends, on those
days. They have all concluded that it is
their duty to attend the Saturday receptions
at the White house, and • Mrs. Cleveland
: will have the pleasant yet tiresome duty of
j receiving greater numbers of social callers
lon Saturday than have any of her distin
guished predecessors. All of the ladies say
they just "love the sweet little woman."
and they are determined that she shall have
the gayest winter ever had in the White
j house. Senator Mahone gave a spec or-
I der to a piano firm in New York, six
I months ago. and has had a splendid instru-
I ment made which has cost an enormous
j sum. it is nearly all hand-made, and is
! regarded as the finest piano ever m^nufac
j tured. He has presented it to Miss Ma-
I hone. who is a very clever performer, and
; the young lady takes great pride in display
j ing its beauties and qualities to her friends.
i The case is of solid, polished rosewood, very
! thick and heavy. It is a concert grand. and
; its tones are said to be wonderfully strong,
sweet and clear.

St. Louis Globe-Democrat.
An impressive illustration of the changes
which tune has made in this country in a
period comparatively brief can be given by
calling a roll of the names of the notable
men who have passed away since the close
of the civil war. On the list, of presi
dents are the names of Lincoln —
who died as the confederacy was
collapsing— Buchanan. Pierce. Fillmore,
Johnson. Garfield, Grant and Arthur. Eight
of the twenty two presidents whom the na
tion has had. or over one-third of the whole
number, have been removed by death in a
period only a little greater than one-tifth of
the time that has passed since the first pres
ident was inaugurated. if we ex
tend the time backward two additional
years we will find that ten of the twenty
two presidents — Van Buren and Tyler dy
ing in 1882— or almost one-half of the en
tire number of chief magistrates of the re
public, have passed from the stage of life in
less than one-fo irtfa of the period since the
government under the constitution was for
mally called into being.
Among the men who bore a conspicuous
part in tho war on titer side who have j
itied since that struggle dosed— omitting
Giant, already mentioned — are Meade, i
Thomas, Hancock, Farragut, McCiellan j
and McDowell, of the Union army and j
navy, and Lee and Breckenridge, of the i
forces of the Confederacy. Of the civilians
more or less distinguished during the war !
who have gone hence since then are Sew
ard. Fessenden. Lot M. Morrill, Stan- ;
ton. Gideon Welles. Zaeh Chandler, j
Tbaddeus Stevens. John A. Andrew, E. D. j
Morgan, O. P. Morion, Greeley, Wade, I
Wilson, Sumner, Colfax. Seymour and i
Charles Francis Adams, of the North, and
J. P. Benjamin. A. H. Stevens and Robert
Toombs, of the South.
The men who have departed within the
past two decades bearing a national reputa
tion made since the war ended can be
counted by the dozen. Among the best
known whose names come to mind at this
moment are Frelinghuysen, Tilden, Hen
dricks and John Kelly.
Fully as numerous as these are the men
who have come to the front in our national
affairs since the war ended. Few, indeed,
of the members of the present congress
were known twenty-one years ago outside
of the city or village in which they re
sided. Of the men whose names are men
tioned prominently to-day in connection
with the Democratic nomination
for the presidency in 18S8. Randall alone
was known to the country in 1865.
The name of J. G. Carlisle had not
then passed beyond the confines of his
native state, while nobody ; beyond the
boundaries of the city in which he resided
had at that time heard of David B. Hill.
Equally unknown to fame in 1865, and six
teen years later, was the gentleman who Is. {
vow president of the United States. New
questions have come up for settlement since
emancipation eliminated the : slavery issue j
from national politics aud new men have
arisen to grapple with them.
Twenty-one years is a short period in the
record of a nation, and only a point in time
in the history of a race; and vet, of the con- i
spicuous figures in our na.ional life in 1865. !
almost all have vanished save Sherman. j
Hamlin, Con kling. Dawes, Blame and Thur- i

the only ones who remained in public life. '

Washington, Dec. Shortly before
3 o'clock this morning a fire was discovered
under the stage of Herzog's opera house in
this city, which in a short time enveloped
the whole building in flames. Aided by a
strong wind and the inflammable material
in the opera house, the flames soon gutted
the whole building from cellar to attic.
To-night nothing but the brown-stone, ice
covered outer walls are standing. Build
ings in the vicinity were seriously endan
gered, but were saved by the strenuous
exertions of the firemen, and the fact that
they were covered with snow, which had
been falling all night and was still descend
ing. The building was erected by the
Young Men's Christian association, and its
large hall in the second and third stories
was formerly used for concert and lecture
purposes, whence it derived the appellation
of Lincoln hall. For a few years past the
hall has been occupied as a theater, doing
business at popular prices, and was i named
: Herzog's opera house. The building,
lit is said, is still owned ' by
the Y. M. C. A., but it is heavily
j mortgaged. The loss on the building is

Night Scenes iv the French Capital
•Vol Ulv-led a* Other Resort-.
Letter in the Boston Trsn -cript.
It is reckoned that gamblers of the Melis
sano type do not, on an average, last more
than five years in Paris. A considerable
proportion die by th»ir own hand, others
die from nervous exhaustion, others disap
pear and become billiard markers, card
room waiters, or take to less respectable
calling in other places and under other
names. It is said that a certain marquis,
who a few years since was a notable figure
at the court of King Baccarat, is now blow
ing a hunting horn at a cafe chantant at
Khefa-9 with a salary of 3 francs a night
Those, however, who. when they have no
more money or no more credit, abscond
and change their names, are not thorough
going gamblers. A Bfelissano stands by his
i guns until the last. He stakes everything
I —money as long as he has it. and then
credit — with the hope of righting himself in
I the world's estimation, and when he has no
I more credit he stakes his life. Such gam
blers have a code of morals which they all
admit by a sort of tacit understanding, but
do not often talk about. The subject is not
a cheerful one. They look upon a man as
dishonored who when he is ruined quits the
scene of his ruin and his creditors.
If on the other hand he destroys himself,
the voice of censure is hushed; he is said to
have "paid." The vision of the revolver is
balieved to have cured many a young gam
bler of the vice; but after a time this
gloomy vision loses its terror and becomes,
as a French writer puts it, a • 'solution."
The gambler often knows wben fortune has
turned a deaf ear on him, knows better
than any other man. that he is rushing to
the precipice, to the horrible death of the
suicide, and as the fatal hour approaches
when he' will have to pay, like Faust, for
his gratification, he becomes calm and ap
parently cheerful. It is the calm of the
torrent just before it leaps the rocks Into
the abyss. Prince Melissano was, singu
larly gay and cheerful ou the night before
the tragedy. At '2 o'clock in the morning
he was at the Restaurant Weber "supping"
in what is called here, ofteu with woeful
irony, "joyous company." His con
versation was particularly sprightly and he
seemed to have thrown all cares to the
wind. A few hours later he was a corpse.
His case is only one of many. This death
is much talked about now, but in a week or
two it will be almost forgotten. .It will
have no influence whatever upon ether
gamblers who know that they are being
sucked under by the same whirlpool.
Those who walk the Paris streets iv the
dead of night, when all the theaters are
dark and the cafes are closed, will see the
club ablaze with many lights and may be
sure that there are other Melissanos there
with the ■ spectre of the revolver before
their eyes. , These clubs have multiplied of
late years, and although they may call
themselves literary, artistic |or •' what not,
they are supported by the gambling tables.
Paris has become a vast gambling hell,
compared to which the establishment at
Monte Carlo is but a puny affair.
