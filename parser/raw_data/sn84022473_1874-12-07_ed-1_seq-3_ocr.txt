fied the cyo by their beautiful arrangement
and ornamentation, while tho viands wouU
have procured tho approbation ot the most
difficult epicure. " The Bride's Cake " was

Tim niiislcul Convention nt Ullttillc
bury.
CLOSISO DAY.
The twcnty-fourlh annual convention of
tho western Vermont musical association
closed at Jliddlcbury on Friday. Tho day
was mado the most successful ot tho week,
by a largo atlcmlanco of singers and spec
tators, nud the production of some very
excellent music.
The annual meeting of tho association
was held in the morning for the election of
olllcers. Jlcssrs. John E jglcs of Brandon,
JI. A. Jlunroe of Jliddlcbury, G. F. Wash-
burn of New Haven, and Georgo Q Day of
ltutland, were appointed a committee to
nominate, and Jlcssrs. D. S. Fletcher of
Brandon, and E. A. Haseltinc of Biistol,
were appointed auditors. The nominating
committee presented the following nomina
tions for officers :
President I. Jl. Tripp, of Jliddlcbury.
Secretary N. P. Barbour, of Middle-
bury.
Tieasurcr A. II. Cobb, of ltutland.
These nominations were ratified by tho
association and the officers ns nominated
were elected for the ensulug year.
At the social hour in the afternoon the
hall was filled and tho programme as or
ranged by the committee was carried out to
t lie satisfaction of all listeners. JIastcr
Harry Engles of Brandon opened the exer
cises with a piano solo. This young gent
leman of thirteen is a musical prodigy,pos-
scsscd of a good voice and nn excellent Idea
of piano music, Jlrs. Pitts, of Sudbury,
then sang tho soprano solo "Angels ever
bright nnd fair" In very good Yoico, follow
ed by the bass solo "Tho threo culls " sung
by Jlr. John Engles of Brandon. Jlrs.
barter and Mrs. Spring then sang tho
charming duet "Tho rolling sea," which
received an encore and Iho ladles returned
and sang another equally effective. Jlrs.
Shepherd then performed a brilliant piano
6olo, followed by a bass solo, "Tho Crca.
lion," by Hev. Jlr. Thomas. Mrs. Carter
sang "Loving Soni'" and Jlrs. Spring tho
"Swltzer's dream of home," which closed
tho social hour.
THE COXOEKT
Tho closing concert In the evening was
attended by it full house, nud was a very
successful entertainment throughout. It
was opened with the anthem "Tho Pil
grlm's Prayer" sung by the class with nito
and tenor solos by Jlrs. Spring nnd Jlr,
A. J. Phillips. Jlrs. Shepherd then rcn.
dercd n delightful piano solo which wos
loudly cucorcd, The next was a duett
sung by Jlrs. Caitcr and Mrs. Spring,
"Soft fell tho Dews of tho Summer Nlg'at,"
which In execution aud effect surpassed
nny of tho previous efforts of tho ladies.
and was enthusiastically encored, to which
th slaters responded with "O how sweet
tho Hunters Bong." Tho splendid male
quartello "lu absence" by Dudley Buck,
was then rendered by Jlcssrs. Sliecrar, E.
P. Phillips, B. D. Hopkins nnd Thomas.
A contralto solo (Italian) by Jlrs. Spring
followed, and to tho encore she sang, by
request, the ballad "Bay of Dublin." Jlr.
John Englcs nnd his sou Harry, thcu ap
peared and sung their favorlto German
duet winch was encored nnd repeated.
Tho chorus "SlnglHallelnjah" by Donizetti
was followed by n soprano solo (Italian)
by Jlrs. Carter, which was complimented
with nn" encoro to which sho lesponded
with the bewitching ballad "Will you
Jlect mo at the Brook." In this she capti
vated the cntlro nudlcnco by her stylo of
singing nnd charming naivete. Jlr. A. J.
Phillips followed Willi "The Tempest," by
Dudley Buck, which was heartily encored
nnd ho then Bang "Tho AVnrrlor Bold,"
with fine effect. Tho male quartette,
"Hie the Shnllop" was then sung by
Jlcssrs. Sliecrar, E. P. Phillips, B. D.
Hopkins and Thomas, with an obllgato
solo by Jlrs. Cuter. Tills was ono of tho
finest efforts of the evening and closed tho
fit st pirt of tho programme.
The second part of the evenings pro
cramtno consisted of tho production of tho
40lli lValm by Dudley liuck. This com
position Is ono of the best of its author nod
was well performed by the class. The
opening choius, "God Is our lefuge," la
one of great power, and was mado very i;f
fective, especially so in llie tenor pail. The
chorus was followed bv "Theio is a river,"
sung by two sopranos nnd two contraltos,
followed by n double quiutett, "God is In
the midst,' with an obllgato for soprano.
Then followed the b.is solo and iccitiiiion,
"Tho heathen ingelh," by Jlr. Thomas.
Tho choius, "Th.- Lotdof Hosts Is with
us," which Micrccdod was very line. The
tenor solo, "Como hither and behold,"
which followed, was sung by Jli. A. J.
Phillips In splendid stjlo nnd "was voted to
bo tlie greatest bticccss of tho pciforinauce
of tho Piialm. Jlr. Phillips seemed to
catch tho inspiration of Iho music and
words and his Interpretation was spiiitcd,
graceful nnd inspiring. This was followed
by the quartette. "Be still then nnd know,"
sung by Jlr. A. J. Phillips, Jlrs. Cm lor,
Jlrs. Snilng, and Jlr. Thomas. Could the
bass have lucii snug by Jlr. Hopkins, the
quartette would have 'been n perfect suc
cess.. Jlr. Thomas' voice lacks melody and
falls to blend In wilh the other parts. The
chorus, "The Lord of Hosts." inlioducmg
tho quartette, "The God of Jacob," closed
the Poalni.
Thus close.l a very successful conven
tion in every respect, ltsconductor, Piof.
lllgloy, may congrntularu bimselt on tho
success of lils first attempt at directing n
convention, for to him may be accorded
the praise of biinging a largo chorus to so
high a dcgiec of perlection. Willi a little
moio grace In wielding the baton lie would
leave nothing to bo desired.
Tho soloists, Jlra C.iilerand Jlrs. Spring,
hae been so often to Vermont, and their
leputation is so well established heio that
no word of ouib is nectssary at this time.
They arc, to say the lc.'.sl, tho best duet on
the concert stage lu New England, while
ns soloists they show gie.U cultivation and
a thorough knowledge of music. Every
year they appear belorc us we can note de
cided Improvement in the range and power
of Jlrs. Cutter's voice, while Jlrs. Sprina
sings ns smoothly and sweetly ns ever. It
is not surprising to notlco that mo in de
mand nil tho while nnd aie to sing at the
convention in St. Albans on the Sfllli.
Western Vermont sent some of its best
representatives to Jliddlcbury tills year,
iu the poisons of li. P. Phillips, A. J.
Phillips, Ben. 1). Hopkins, Dr. John
Shecrnr, while Jlr. Kollin C. Smith not
only was present in propria persona?, but
nl.io brought n largo delegation from his
several eitiglnij schools In I'lllsford, New
Haven, Onvell nnd o'.ber towns.
The conductor's cll'oits were ably so
conded by Mrs. Jlaiiba Dma Sl.cpb.cn), of
Ashland, N. 11., the pianist of tho conven
tion, who cannot be equalled in this part of
New England iu that capicity. Mie is
also to bo nt St. Albans the last of this
month.
The officers of tho association, pjesident
Tripp, treasuier Cobb, and secrelaiy Bar
bour, mo perfectly competent to make an
affair of thb kind a success, aud it is well
that thev are re-elected for tho year to
come. Tho next convention, it is thought,
will be held nt Fairhavcn, although not ns
yet fully decided.

Tile Iniiucl nt M. AltKins A Clue
to the .llurilurvr A MrmiKu Moi)',
Tho following account of the Inquest as
to the murder of Jllss Ball, held by Justice
Farnswortli on Thursday, is condensed
from the St. Albans itcptcnaer :
On tho 22d day of September a young
man named Perkins, 20 years old, from
Fairfax, wont to work for Jlr. A. J. Smith
on a farm lying between St. Albans and
Gcorg'a Bay. As they wero milking ouo
n'ght he said ho knew where thoso clothes
were. Jlr. Smith made some reply, to the
effect that they brought them in with them,
supposing that he icfcrred to their coats,
which they had thrown off in the field
while at woik. But Perkins said lie didn't
mean that, but rcfefrcd to the clothes of
Jliss Ball. Smith then drew out a story
which led him to suspect that bo was on a
clue, and so lie thought he would quietly
follow it up.
Taking iuto ills confidence Geo. Bron
son, they went to tho young man's home
In Fairfax and theio tho boy's mother,
Jlrs. Itlggs, told them tho samo story that
ho had, with somo other paillculars. Tho
story in brief is that a man named John
JInson, somo fifty ycais old, nnd n spinner
by occupation, had spent considerable timo
nt Jlr. Biggs' when not at wotk in the fac
tories at Fairfax, Enosburgh Falls, Shcl
don or elsewhere. Ho had been there the
week beforo tho murder nnd told them
that uhen lie came again lie might bring a
friend with him. On Saturday night, July
25th, tho next day after the murder, two
men came to their house after they had iC'
tired and tiled to get In, one callins; on
both Jlr. nnd Jlrs. Biggs to open the door.
but tboy lcfuscd them admittance. Jlrs
B. is posltlvo that tho man calling was
John JIason.
Ho was not seen after that for somo six
weeks, when ho returned there, nnd In con
vcrsatlon went on to describe how Jllss
Ball was murdered. He said it was done
by one man, though another was present
that ho sprang in behind her, seized her,
nnd when sho screamed lie struck her on
the head with a btono ; that ho then drew
her over tho fence, which lie had previously
thrown down, nud dragged her to tho
thicket i that she thero caught hold of
staddlc, and lio struck her hand with
club, breaking threo of the fingers ; that
other blows wcro then dealt, and they drew
her further on into tho woods; that they
pushed tier watch nnd belt ono side into Iho
leaves (and the woman gavo such descrlp
tlon of tho watch as ho gavo her, nnd It is
said to bo tolerably liko) that after they
had Iain her behind tho stump sho rolled
her head lor somo timo nud then
breathed her last! they then laid
iier out and went down to the
stream nnd washed themselves, taking
along her bundle ; that they examined her
wallet beforo leaving her, but found noth
ing in it but her teacher's ccrtlhcate and
somu poetry clipped from a paper ; they
first burled her bundle, which he said con
tallied her drawers, night ttrcis, slippers,
etc., in the saw dust at tho mill, but after
ward took out a stone from the underpin
ning and thrust it in tlicro,
Tho young man Perkins says that onn of
the men then went off south towards Fair
fax nnd tho other came to St. Albans and
took thn train south. Jlrs, Iliggs at tho
timo called tho attention of deputy sheriff
Hnlbcrt to the matter, nnd ho went to her
houso and Investigated It. But ho had no
confldcnco In it, aud tho woman herself
says that folks don't always believe what
sho tells.
But there Is another nnd even more sus
picious circumstance related by her, rdnt
lnjr to tho Jllnard murder, which occurred
only n fow days beforo the murder of Miss
Ball. Tho next day after that murder, and
beforo It was known In St. Albans, ehe
says that JIason came In her houso nod
told her all about It. Sho had not then
heard of It, but afterward heard the flcls
ns they becamo known to tho public, ?nd
they corresponded with tho stoiy that he
had told her. At that time the asked
him to fix the clock, which was out
of repair, lie said ho couldn't for he
hadn't nny tools not even n knife. She
says that sho knows that he had previously
bad a knife, lor sho had used it and broken
tho point off ono of the blades. Sho wns
then asked to give a description of the
knife, which she did, and It coneipondcd
precisely with the appearance of tho kilfe
that was taken from the body of Miturd.
She was asked if sho should knnwlho kilfo
on sight, nnd sho thought she would, i A
largo number of knives wero then jro
duccd nnd she selected one that she vns
very positive was JIason's, It rai the
lime knife that mat taken from thi hoihjof
ilinanl.
JIason disappeared shortly after relating
the story to her nnd ills whereabouts lie
not known. While tho authorities tiro by
nn means sanguine this will lead tn a (is
covery of tho murderer of cither vlclin,
yet tho story Is sufficiently suspicious so
that they will learn what moio about It
they can. JIason bad known Jllss Bill,
had seen her at her sister's in Sheldon, n)d
It is said ho acquired a violent dislike jol
lier. Jlrs. Hmgs says when betoldler
the strange story he said the gill was mur
dered from ill-will and not to cover up to
other cilnic.

Prognostications of the President's
Message.
Wasiiinoton, Dec. 0.
Tho President's message Is not yet quite
completed, owing to delay In receiving the
report of tho District of Columbia com
missioners, a lcfercncc to which will bo
added to the message to-morrow morning.
Copies of the message nro being made to
day for congress and the lcprcsentativcs of
the press association, nlthough tho Presi
dent has slum n tho mcssago to no person
other than the members of the cabinet aud
the copyist. Thcrq Is the best reason for
the belief that It will contain substantially
the following point', founded on expres
sions ot tho President to Intlmato friends
since tho message wns submitted nnd cor
dially endorsed by the cabinet on Friday
last. The President says, although he did
not commence the picparatlon of his mes
sage until a week ago yesleulay, some
of Iho newspapers had previously
prognosticated Its contents, nlthough lio
hail consulted nobody ns to what it should
contain, i'hciu Is no doubt the message
will state that our lel.itiuns with all foreign
-powers ate filcndlv aud without disturb
ance, though thcic It an Unsettled question
1th Venezuela, which has not yet paid
the awards of the joint commission under
tlio convention of 18813. Congress, It will
be iccoliected, stioiigly cxnicssed its sense
on this subject in February, 187:1. Tho
picsldent In his message of lust December
a'd there was reason to believe tho hesi
tancy of tho republic In recognizing tho
claims spuing In p.nt, nt least, from real
difficulty In discharging them In connection
ith Its obligations to other governments,
and tlierefoio the c.'.pediensy of further
foihc.iiance o:i the part of our
governmc'it was believed to be worthy
f the consideration of Congress.
In addition to A'enezucla wo havo un
settled questions with Spain growing out
f the affair of the Vlrginlus and other
grievous transactions on tho pait of the
Spanish nulboiities In connection with
events in Cuba. Tho magnitude of the of
fences lias not been reduced since tlio pres.
Idcnt's picvious mcssago nyear ago. As tho
unsettled condition of affairs in Cuba can
not long continue, it may becomo neces
sary for oilier nations with our own to In
tcrfeie to tciminate he insurrections which
has s.i long picvallcil. The- Spanish cov-
crnmcnt having unsuccessfully attempted
to suppress It, mcmlimc tho commcico of
nil counttles and especially that of the Un
ited States suffers, the Hags of the United
Slates and England having been insulted,
Tho president iu conversation, although ho
docs not state the fact in his message says
the United States purchase nbout eighty
per cent, of Cuban expoits, and tlierefoio
the duties paid by American citizens con-
ibutc to tills extent in helping Spain to
continue llio war against insurgents.
Tho plesMcnt had hoped that
by the meeting of congress to
moirow tho pie.-cnt iVgulatious with
Spam would have been ended, but in tins
e has been disappointed. He therefore
ays In his message iittlo or nothing about
indemnity pending the negotiations, but at
future time villi present the subject to
the special niibidcrntion of Congress. The
Hum of thn Picsldent on tho financial
question is positive, as lollows : Notwith
standing the fonuer speculations of thoso

and will tceonimend resumption of specie
payments nt tho earliest practical day ; but
bq does not believe this can be leached as
soon as the first day of January, 1870. He
docs not name any day, leaving congress to
devise the means to secure this desued cud
it being the duty of congress to do so.
1 lio legal tender clause of the currency
act should bo icpealed to effect as to con
tracts mado nfter the day to be fixed by

to the secretary of tlio Ircasuary to obtain

i lie funeral ccicmonlcs of tlio lato may

the municipal departments wcic closed for
tho purpose ot nffordiug the officials nnd

awaiting tho passage of the fuueral pro

St. Paul's Methodist church sang a hymn,
nfter winch Dr. Bethuno dellveicd an ad
dress on tho Ufa of tho mayor as a public
man and privato citizen. Dr. Burchard
also made no address on tho career of the
deceased. After tho services tho employes
of tho sugar refine.ies filed past tbo casket,
thoso from Jersoy City having a wido
pleco of crape hanging from tho back of

body was then transferred to tho bier, and
a procession, comprising tho attaches of
Iho vailous municipal departments nud

TONU OF CONOiraS.MEN.
Tho Times says the views of the mem
bers of, congress now at Washington are
very hazy. They arc qulto agreed that they
had noth'ng to do with tho late election dis
aster, though some of them concedo that
tlio late disaster had n good deal to do with
tlicm. Tlicro is a reported Indifference to
the financial question, and a general dispo
sition to lie low aud keep quiet. Tlio prob
ability of dodging tho financial question is
nbout as great for them ns was tho chanco
of Noah's con'cmpoiarics outside the ntk
dodging tho flood.
The Tribuuc says of the message : "The
specie-paying theory Is adhered to, but no
lime for resumption is recommended. The
message Is of n negative character, and de
void of recommendations nnd declarations.
Vice President Wi'son will preside over the
