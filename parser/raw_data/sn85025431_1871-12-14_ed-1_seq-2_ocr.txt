tion of problems of the facts of Geog
raphy, to the determination of the
means, habits, and character of the peo­
ple who inhabit tho countries to which
the facts relate. Such examination
will show much of the pupil's charac­

what is his diligence, and what is his
progress from day to day.

.recitation is measured,

\ital union with what he previously
knew.
It is of little use to teach the
world is round like a ball to a child
who docs not know that he ever saw the
raith. Until the teacher understands
that, in knowing which way to get
home, and whether there are houses,
or trees, or books by the way, the child
Iknows something of Geography, and.
until he makes this the basis of other
knowledge fit to be joined to it, he docs
not teach the science of (Geography
properly and so of the other branches.
dt is important, again, that what is
taught and learned be expressed in sim­
ple cvery-day language so far as prac
•tieftbVa. Not that scientific statements
»nd formulas are to be discarded.—
They are to be interpreted, because
only then are they valuable. An Al
gebraic formula is worthless to me so
Ions as ic is a mere combination of let­
ters and sijrns. but when I am able to
translate that Algebraic language into
he eo nninn Knglisn speech, I have
obtained a real possession. This ex
pressing of the ideas in proper language
is one of the most effective means of
uniting them with our previous acquis­
itions. It is useful for the teacher to
-enliven his recitations, by imparting a
knowledge of things other that the mat­
ter of the lesson. This should be done

President's Message.
Wo content ourself by giving a
synopsis of this document, not hav­
ing space to print it in full. Its first
sentence is congratulatory, on account of
the success which has attended tho ex­
ecution of the laws of the land. The
policy has been not to enquire into the
wisdom of laws, but to leurn their spe
cial intent and tben to enforce them.
THE ALABAMA CLAIMS TREATY.
Our relations with foreign powers are
friendly. We are likely to settle by
arbitration, disputes ot long standing,
and thus furnish an example to the
world which will be followed by all civ
ilized{nations,thus turniug back into the
ranks of industry millions of men who
are now kept in military array for the
settlemcEt of disputes by the bayonet
*nd the broadsword.
A treaty his already been made with
Great Britain, by which all differences
between that country and the United
States arc to bo adjusted by a peaceful
tribunal, to be specially established for
that purpose. It is expected, also, that
the prin iplea of international law for
which this government has always con
tended will be brought to the notice of
other powers, and be adopted as of uni
versal application.
It is hoped that tho Fit hcry question
will be definately adjusted, and all the
relations between the United btates and
England made amicable and satisfactory.
An appropriation for the purpose of
locating the northwest boundary be
tween the United States and British
North America is recommended.

THE ALDINE,
An illustrated Monthly Journal claimed
to be the handsomest Paper
in the World.
"Give inv love to the artist workmen of
the
ALDIAE
who are striving to make their
profession worthy of admiration for beauty,
as it has always becu for usefulness.—Henry
Ward /ji:v'/l( r.
THE ALD1NE, while issued with all regu
larity, has none ot the temporary or
tinuly
interest characteristic ordinary periodicals.
It is an elegant miscellany of pure, light, and
graceful literature, and collection of pieturis,
tho rarest speci.nens of artistic skill, in black
and white. Although each succeeding num
ber affords afresh pleasure to its friends, the
real vali and beauty of THE ALD1NE will
bo most nj.pieclated after it is been bound
up at, the close of the year. While other pub
lications may claim superior cheapness as com
pared with rivals of a similar class, THE
AEDINE is a unique and original conception
—alone and unapproaclud—absolutely with
out competition in pricb or chaiacter. The
possessor of tho volume just completed cannot
duplicato the quau'.ity of tiue paper and
engravings in any other shape or number if

We havo not, at this early moment of wri
ting, sufficient facts to justify us in giving the
exact figures of our loss in tho late terrible
fire at Chicago, bnt the following card from
tho Cincinnati Ciunmerelnt, of October 10th,
we trust, will be ampltt to allay any fears that
may have aiiscn:

Oct. 9- 10:30 P. M.
I have to-night carfully examined all Chi
cago insurarees in tho Andes Insurance Com
pany ot Cincinnati. We shall authorize our
adjusters to draw upon us at sight tor every
correct claim as rapidly as ascertained. Our
losses by this great calamity arc a considerable
figure, but nothing to cripple us. The hour
of duty is upon us, and we shall meet it in the
lion-hearted manner that tho occasion requires.
Nevertheless, I fu'ly expect, in addition to sur
mounting this serious obstacle, to pay tho
stockholders of the Andes Insurance Company
a comfortable dividend next July.
