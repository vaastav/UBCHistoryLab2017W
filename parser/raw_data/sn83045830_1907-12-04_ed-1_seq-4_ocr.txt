PRESIDENT RO03EVELT'S MES?
SAGE TO CONGRESS.
TLo President's nieiirtnr,o to Con
green which was road at noon yes?
terday to thnt body Is marked prin?
cipally by Its length. Tutore Is In the
document a mass Cf wo.ds thai la nl
moit staggering and bei little that Is
now. Fearful that the message would
not bo marked by Its length, the
President quotes whole pages full of
the document lie rent to Conp.iosr.
last year, and the total result Is over
thirty thousand words. The Presi?
dent':! opening Is most patriotic and
has the tlngo ofcia Fourth of July ora?
tion! Ho dwells at some length upon
lie-- resourcoti of this nation and point1:,
out the well-known truth that, there
Biro, opportunities In plenty to bo dis?
honest. "Successful dishonesty," as'
tho President puts it, snoiild bo warred
against until It Ii entirely done away
with In the United States. Ho ndmllll
that, there perhaps may bo persans
who do not r.greo with his policy of
oxtcrmtnat'-on of tho "successful ills
honrnt" man, but asks Congress to
go at the (ask with an unillucblng
porseverancc.
As ho has; roptatdly said before tho
Proa I dent behoves there iu only cue
way to curb the big corporations, and
that in by federal control. Ho innlr.
tains that the control of the trusts
ami railroads can be glvou over to tho
federal government without further
legislation, a;: there are already law's
giving that power. He says on this
question that the federal government
iu in no noci of an extension of pow?
er, bnit that it is time for an exten?
sion of activity. Ho usos his well
worn argument that the centralizing
. of business can bo only coped with
by centralized power. In other words,
ho would have the states have noth?
ing t; say relative to the control of
a c, rporhtftm with an interstate hur.i
ncijH, As tbi.-. recommendation Is the
very leador of the message, it is a
noir evident fact that the President
regards tho complete abolishment of
. states' lights one of the leading ques
tibhn of tho hour. Again ho shown
that not sltico tlio days of Hamilton
lias the centralization Idea had such
nn ardent advocate as it now lias in
Proddent Roosevelt, but as much as
Mr. Roos?volt wants this favorite
eehemo carried cut. it will bo a long
time before the majority of Congress
will agree with him in his unsound
;' views on this question.
Thore is hardly a subject
treated in tho now mossago with:
' o'^t the words, "orte oC my for?
mer messages," cr "as I have
repeatedly said before," and >t
Is so with his remarks on tho Slier
? man antitrust law. As has boon fore
caotod by the correspondents in
JVashington, tlio Prealdout docs not
oik for the repeal of the Sherman
law, bm c;r elaborate amendments.
Ho wants it nioro effective and mado
tip that it suits tbo conditions of the
tlu.o letter. Iu thld tho President
ts rieht. Tho Sherman law is not
. ofliciont; it has outgrown itself. When
It was cnactrHl it seemed to cover the
ground fully, but. tho consolidations
jf the corporations have become ho
great and tho trust.-' of tntch magni?
tude, that tho law uo langer eovoro
tb? Situation lu u satisfactory iutin
nur. Out while discussing thin sub
j Jcct, iio goes out of bin way to say
Hint all -amendments made
nliould Ik* so that tbo power
bo given t,> tho national gov?
ernment, not to tho states, anil
lu doing so, Mr. Roosevelt makes
what appears to us d very weak argu,
tnout tind olio not worthy of tho pages
of tho animal message of u President
of the 1'nltod States to Congress, He
make- the claim that governmental
supervision over a big corporation
will malto It ?iifor and says: "in tho
recent busluosa crisis It in noteworthy
that the Institutions which failed
wore institutions which woro not tin
'.!> ??? the supervision ami control of Dm
national government Those which
woro Under national control stood tho
teat."
There can bo only c-ne point to Iho
argument of the president on this
question, and 11 Is that the reason
why corporations would bo better otr
un.W governmental control, would bo
because of Iho aid that would be glv
on to them. Castiug aside (he
nonsensical statement that gov?
ernmental control win make a
trust safer, let tin for n mo?
ment take up tho 'assertion ho makes
about the banks. Ii Is true that In
New York Iho tanks that went to
tho wall woro not national banks, but
If tho truth were told, there wore na?
tional banks in New York city nt that
lima which wero In Just ns precarious
a condition Ca those which went
to tho wall', but which worn saved by
outside and purely BOlflsh lnflucne?s.
The President falls, it might be well
to remark, to state that there were
a number of national bank failures
outside of New York city which woro
working under a governmental char?
ter. The whole statement and argu?
ment or tho President in thin portion
of. tho message Is so fallacious that
It Is really not worth considering in
a serious light. Wo would, however,
ask any sane or sensible person if
ho believes that It would be wife lor'
tlio federal rjoverurucnt tj aid a. trust;
or a railroad or any largo corporation
In n financial manner every time It
might happen to bo In distress?
The President urges Congress to
glvo Us attention to tho question of a
greater elasticity lu our currency
laws and suggests that. It might be
well to investigate the matter of bank
directors loaning money to them?
selves, and while ho admits there is
a great need to prevent marginal
gambling, though bo does not call It
that ho Bays be cannot see how it
can Ui entirely prevented. While be
does not directly defend the methods
of Wall street he does so Indirectly,
and makes no re^rnmondationa to
Congress on the subject- whatever. It
Is true that the solution of this prob?
lem h; a moat diuicult one, but it is
a disappointment that President
Ilcosovolt, tlio man who Is supposed
to ho tho poesospor or tho highest
sort of ideal, rhould so utterly neglect
this all Important question In his mos-j
sago. Perhaps he will later on give
Congress and tlio country at largo bin
vieWg on the subject lu a special
message. Let us hone 60 anyway. I
Of coursp the tariff question re?
ceived the scantiest sort of consider?
ation. The president by his mega?
phone taetU-i hud announced that ho
did not believe- the tariff should be
touched until after tho presidential
election, and that is exactly what ho
says in his message. Tho Democrats
cannot runotid tho Dingle} law, but
they can come close to having tho
Republican party place Itself on re?
cord, and that Is what the people want
I next to having tho law Itself amended.
I lie takes a gloomy view on the
question of having clean and -well eon.
! ducted campaigns. He says that evils
exist, but believes that .It will take
a long time to correct them. In ?in
I or words, he does not desire to have
them corrected until ho Is sure thai
j lie. is no longer vitally Interested.
There are a whole lot of Other
. things di?cu??Od in tho mcsrago which
ireiterate tho President's well-known
views on tho subjects in qucs'ion.
. The hiossage as a w'ijoL\ is u disap?
pointment.

1 THE VERDICT IN THE BRADLEY

and social custom.- or savagery,
The defense wan Insanity, and
though perhaps the unfortunate- wo?
man was no:, actually Insane its the
woni is generally accepted, her mind

Mrs. BraiHoy committed tlio crime

charitable ilew to bo lakco o* Uie
matter Is that which led tho Jury to
make her it free woman?'.hat tho

that be was a vauiplro aud a leech,
who regarded womankind us bis prey.
HU regard for virtue amounted to
nothing, and his Standard of morals
was tho lowest nf the low. it 1? on<^
of the phoxplaj'iaoblo things of life
that. It Is Just such men In whom
many women place their trust and
thotr honor, and when one of these
human vuittiros mooiu death nt the
bands of one of his vlctiiika there is
n feeling that he has received bis
Just descrtri, and for lite moment even
the 1.1'W abiding and law loving cit?
izen forge la Ilm law.
It Is numan nature to view amh
easea In this light. The man or
?woman Wfld does not Is not normal,
but Just :he same it should never be
forgot ion that thore lb a law of tho
land to bo preserved; that It it 1b not
preserved the luovitaolo result will
be anarchy; n condition that no nor?
mal pertxev des-'res.
In the Bradley case, however, it
wad a verdict caused by a defense
which la unmissable by tho !<mv und
that such la the case in a cause for
congratulation. That thore was not
a 8Ur\*l\*al of savage or half civilized
ethics In this case I? duo to the good
judgement, of Mrs. ltramey's lawyers.
Tho great principle of civilized law
is that there .should bo no private
revenge of Individual wrongs ar.d
