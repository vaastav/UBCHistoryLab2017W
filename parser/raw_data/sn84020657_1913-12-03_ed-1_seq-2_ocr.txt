THE PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE.
tiW/ ^ MI ST use the resources of the country, not lock them
W up." This sentence forms a not unimportant part of
the message of President Woodrow Wilson to the Con
gress. It is important because it reflects the policy that is to
be adopted by the Administration with regard to the natural re
sources of Alaska and to the Nation at large.
The message of the President is the most significant so far
as Alaska is concerned, that has been delivered to the Congress
in many years, because it gives recognition to the needs of Al
aska. and urges the development of the Territory, in a manner
that cannot be mistaken either by Congress or the people.
Admitting that a double duty faces Congress and the Admin
istration in regard to Alaska the President states emphatically
that thf people of this Territory should be given a full territorial
form of government, and Alaska as a storehouse should be un
locked. l'he key to unlock that storehouse, he says, is a system
of railroads, controlled by the government in the interest of all
who wish to use them. It is pointed out that the construction
of railroads is but the first step ? the thrusting in of the key to
the storehouse ami throwing back the bolts of the lock and open
ing the door. II >w the resources are then to be developed will
form a polciy which must be worked out by well-considered
stages, not upon theory, but upon lines of practical expediency,
this being a part of the general problem of conservation. The
President is emphatic in his statement that the resources of the
country must be used, and not locked up. They must not be de
stroyed or wasted; used but not monopolized upon any narrow
ideas of individual rights as against the abiding interests of
the communities. The President is confident that a policy can
Ik- worked out by conference and concession which will release
these resources and yet not jeopardize them or dissipate
them.
A policy that will enable the vast latent resources of this
Territory to be developed along comprehensive lines is thus
clearly foreshadowed. Alaskans may take courage because of
these frank words of the President. It is the first declaration
in favor of a policy that will enable Alaska to be unbottled that
has been enunciated at Washington. It deals with a question,
momentous to the people, fairly and squarely. It is a declaration
of good faith and an expressed promise to put into motion those
agencies of government which will enable the vast natural re
sources of the Territory to be put to legitimate use, and it may
now be confidently expected that the barriers to the completest
development of Alaska along permanent lines, and in the inter- ^
ests of the people, will be speedily removed. <
But while the material development of Alaska is urged, the
references to its political development is marked in the Pres
ident's message. Evidently it is believed that Alaska does not
yet enjoy the full political advantages to which her people are
t nt it led. and a more complete form of territorial government
is demanded, before the doubel duty by which Congress and the
Administration is confronted can be discharged.
Other commanding features of the message are his advo
cacy of primary Presidential nominations, and recommendations
that the merely formal nominating conventions, be made up of
m n already members of the Congress, or who are candidates
for election to that body, the idea being that in this manner
party pi 'forms will b#> framed by those responsible to the peo
ple for carrying them into effect. Whether this plan would be
practicable or not, it at least would be unique.
Mexican affairs are handled courageously in the message.
It is made plain that Mexico now has no government, the attempt
to maintain one having broken down, but in its stead is a military
despotism sot up by a usurper of constitutional authority, and
the perdiction is made that Huerta's power and prestige are crum
bling and the collapse is not far away.
If Standard Oil is financing the Mexican Constitutionalists,
as alleged, it must be admitted that John D.'s company are get
ting a run for their money.
ALASKA RAILROAD BILL.
IT IS not likely that the Alaska railroad bill will be called up in
Congress on Dec. 8, next, the day set for its consideration.
The currency bill is in the way, and in all probability it will
have the right of way until it is disposed of. But it is equally
certain that the railroad bill will not lose its place on the calen
dar. which will give it first place after the currency bill. The
friends of the Alaska bill will see to it that it is not lost sight
of, and its early consideration is made doubly sure in view of the
President's pronouncement in his message on Alaska affairs.
The currency bill is an important measure. The insistent
needs of the country demand its early passage, and the Alaska
bill will not be jeopardized should it not come up for discus
sion and passage until the beginning of the New Year.
Dictator Huerta must be taking things rather quietly since
he finds time now and then to spend a day at his farm. It may
be, however, that he is contemplating an early return to the sim
ple life.
