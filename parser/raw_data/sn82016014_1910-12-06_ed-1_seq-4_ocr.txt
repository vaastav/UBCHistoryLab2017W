FULL LEASED WIRE REPORT
OF THE ASSOCIATED PRESS.
The State Journal Is a member of the
Associated Press and receives the full day
telegraph report of that great news or
ganization for the exclusive afternoon
publication in Topeka.
The news Is received In The State Jour
nal building over wires for this sols pur
pose. Oh, horrors! The girls at Vassar
Thay be forced to don aprons and do
a little cooking. The chefs who have
been working at that institution are on
a strike.
That must be a pretty strong fence
between the location of the Panama
Canal exposition at New Orleans and
Ban Francisco. President Taft is re
ported to be sitting on it.
It is quite apparent that the Diaz of
today is not the Diaz of yore. He is
actually offering terms of peace to
some of his countrymen who have
taken exception to his rule.
: Now that the much desired snow has
come "to save" the wheat crop, it Is
quite likely that many farmers will be
urotesting against It because it will
Bpoil their automobiling for a. spell.
A course of spring training is being
advocated for the umpires in the major
baseball leagues. Without doubt it will
take the form of making them profi
cient in the manly art of self-defense.
' As an important incident to the lat
est successful bank robbery in Kan
eas. the plunderers made good their
get-a-way in an automobile. Presum
ably the bank robbers of the future
will use aeroplanes. Then they will
be hard to tag.
It is almost too late to do your
Christmas shopping early. Still, you
can materially lessen th terrors of the
final rush of Christmas shopping for
the clerks and the store-keepers if you
get busy and do the most of yours
within the next ten days.
The large percentage of gains made
by Idaho, Nevada, Oregon and other of
the northwestern states in their popu
lations during the past decade only
emphasize the fact that there was
rlentv of room for them to grow. But
the whole state of Nevada, even now
hasn't as large a roster of inhabitants
as has Kansas City, Kan.
Some one of those jackies of the
TTnited States battleships, now in Eng
lish waters, missed the opportunity of
his life the other day at the luncheon
that was given them at the historic
Guild hall, London. He should have
risen to his feet and outlined the naval
program that It would be well for
Great Britain to follow in the future.
And that White Elephant, which has
been stalking around in the vicinity of
the.Y. W.' C. A. and the Y. "M. CV A.,
died a natural death. It was -incon
ceivable that the people of Topeka
would not provide the funds needed by
these associations to make them what
they should be. It would have been
unnatural had the White Elephant
been permitted to live.
Secretary Meyer asks congress to
authorize the construction of two more
battleships of the Dreadnought type.
This has been the regular naval pro
gram for the past few years. And at
that rate it would not be many years
before the United States would have a
monster navy, were It not for the fact
that battleships which cost millions
and millions of dollars become out of
date in ten or a dozen years.
Curious, indeed, is the application of
the tariff law in some of its many par
ticulars. Under a new ruling feather
boas will be classified as manufactures
of metal, and for a no better reason
forsooth, than that their chief element
is the metal wiring used in their con
struction. Perhaps there is a better
reason. The duty on feathers is 50 per
cent and the duty on metal manufac
tures is only 45, but It is likely that
the importers of the boas will see to
it that they get all the advantage from
this lesser rate.
Rear Admiral Mason, one of the ord
nance experts of the government, re
ports that shot and. shell have attained
something of a commanding lead over
armor plate. In other words, the pro'
jectiles from the big guns can not be
resisted with much effect by the armor
of the battleships. This undoubtedly
means that a higher grade of armor
will have to be developed If the bat
tleships are going to be worth much
of anything. And this in turn prob
ably means all of the big and expen-
elve battleships which have been con
structed of late will soon be sent to the
Junk pile and be replaced with new
ones with superior armor on them.
Certainly, the price of that kind of
fceace which is promoted by engines
of war is of rather terrifying propor
THE PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE.
p-renirtont Tff annual message to
pnnm w nnita on forceful a docu- !
,,.. . i nno Tf should
IllCUl 4X0 lb 10
appeal strongly to every thinking man I founded or instituted every depart
in th nmintrv.' reeardless of his poll- ment of the work of . the Christian
tics of the political faction with which
h is alHert. indicating that In the ;
nation's chief executive chair, is a
man of wondrously large parts who Is
earnest and solicitous to discharge the
great power placed in his hands for
the benefit bf the whole people.
Undoubtedly the message will have
its critics, unfair and otherwise. There
are likely to be those who will insist
that Mr. Taft is showing a predilection
to let up" on tflie corporations be
cause of his sensible suggestion that
the time has come for an administra
tion and enforcement of existing laws
relative to the regulation of corpora
tions, rather than for additional leg
islation on this subject. Mr. Taft has
the excellent idea that it would be well
to see how these, laws operate before
other laws of like tenor, or purpose
are placed on the statute books.. And
although the .newly amended interstate
commerce law does not include all the
suggestions made by the president In
his last message to congress on this
subject, he does not urge congress to
take action on these views. He would
like to see the law as it exists given
a fair trial. He does suggest, however,
that an appropriation be made which
will permit the interstate commerce
commission to undertake the work of
placing a physical valuation on the
property of the railroads. He says the
commission has ample power to han
dle this proposition, the only thing it
lacks heing money to do the work. This
ought to meet with the approval of
those railroad regulatory enthusiasts
wiho believe that a governmental valu
ation of the railroads will develop into
some sort of a panacea by which all
rate-making and other railroad evils!
may be rectified.
Chagrin will also be brought by the
message to those prophets who have
been predicting that the corporation
interestsTvad planned to use the wan
ing days of friendly Republican power
to pull the teeth of the Sherman anti
trust law by amending it in several
ways that would destroy its effective
ness. The intimation has beeh that
President Taft was in sympathy with
this plan, as he would have to be if
it went through, because these amend
ments could not become effective with
out his favorable signature. But the
president seems to dispose of . this
bogie by making the emphatic an
nouncement: "I do not now recom
mend any amendment to the anti
trust law."
President Taft also proves himself to
be quite as progressive as the most
ardent of the conservationists. He goes
most of them, who content themselves j
with pointing out the beauties of the
conservation theory, one better. He has
practical plans for establishing a con
servation policy which will conserve
but which not prevent the develop
ment of valuable ipublic lands. He rec
ommends that all of the government
lands having deposits of coal, phos
phate and oil, and water power sites,
as well, be disposed of in the future
by leasing. Now they are ' sold out
right to claimants at a figure that is
meager compared with their value, and
the government thereby loses title and
any kind of a control over them.
The president's reference to the tar
iff is in line with his well known
views on this subject. He is fair
enough to admit, as he has all along,
that some of the criticism of the Payne
tariff law is Just. He believes that an
honest revision of the tariff in accord
with the Republican policy of an ade
quate protection, but no more, can
only be brought about by piecemeal
legislation, each schedule being taken
up as the data is gathered for it, and
he would have the present advisory
tariff boaFd made a permanent tariff
commission to make the necessary in
vestigations for a proiper revision of
eadh schedule.
Once again does President Taft point
out that one of the crying needs of
the people of the country is cheapening
the cost of litigation by simplifying
Judicial procedure and expediting final
Judgment. A commission is needed to
investigate this subject and there is
already a bill In congress, fathered by
Representative Madison of this state,
providing for the creation of such a
commission which should be adopted
The president's insistence that there
is urgent need for the practice of econ
omy in the administration ui me or
fairs of the government ought to strike
a responsive chord with the people who
pay the bills even if the federal taxes
are raised by indirect taxation, presi
dent Taft shows that he is practicing
what he preaches in this particular
by having had the estimates for gov
ernment expenditures for next year cut
down by nearly $53,000,000 under what
were the actual appropriations for the
current year. It is such a stewarasnip
of governmental affairs as President
Taft recounts in his message that is
worth while.
MRS. EDDY.
In the death of Mrs. Mary Baker
Glover Eddy there passes away one
of the world's remarkable women, not
only of this, but also of other days.
This much will have to be conceded
even by those who are entirely out of
sympathy with the principles of the
Christian Science which she has pro
mulgated.
Here was a slip of a woman, frail
of body, with no unusual endowments
in the way of an education, living a
rather-usual sort of a life for almost
the first fifty years of it; 'who estab
lished a new religious denomination
or cult, that now haa innumerable de
votees in all parts of the world. It
was only a little over thirty years ago
that she established the First Chris
tian Science Church at Boston, Mass.
Now there are branches of this church
all over the world. In 1907, the last
date of the statistics of this church
which are at hand, there were 702 of
them, as well as 294 Christian Science
societies not yet organized as churches.
Since that period the growth of this
sect has been large. It is safe to as
sert that no other religious denomina -
tion can show such a development in
so brief a period. And its growth and
development haa been dominated al-
most solely bv Airs. Hiaay. oe
Science denomination. Her sway has
been absolute. Her dictum has been
accepted by the members . of this
church in much the same way as the
infallibility of the Pope of Rome on
questions of morals and religion is
recognized by the Roman Catholics of
the world.
It is these things that have
stamped Mary Baker Glover Eddy as
awonderful woman. The denomina
tion she has established has no creed.
Its religious beliefs are based on Mrs.
Eddy's interpretation of the Scriptures.
Whether it will continue to grow and
develop without her guiding hand, a
rule that admitted of no appeal, re
mains to be seen. At any rate., it is
one of the strong religious denomina
tions of today. And its creation and
development is the work of a woman,
a woman undeniably great, even if
her doctrines are not acceptable to
every one. - . ,

Mr. James J. Hill backs up from his

if he did.

tunities for speculation on an advanc

reaction, not of trouble but of caution.
It really was necessary to stop tne
boom and it has been done without
hurting anyone, merely cramping a
few toes and mashing a few fingers.
The prices of farm products are at
the base of prosperity in the west.
The politicians decided that they were
too high and made the people Deneve

cessation in the strong demand for
land and a little economizing which
cut down the call for manufactured
stuff lessened the output of labor. Dur

they were allowed to continue. Money

SPOTLESS TOWNS.
To the long ' list of philanthropic
schemers who have tried through the
expenditure of millions to carry out

Mrs. Russell Sage has added her name.

whose fame was not very conspicuous

suburban city.
She has purchased 412 acres in For
est Hills gardens. Long Island, about
nine miles from New York City, where
she will provide homes for 1,500 fam
ilies. Mrs. Sage announces that this is not
a charity scheme, but that the enter
prise is contrived to be self-supporting,
and is intended to return a fair
return on the investment. That is the
only part of the enterprise, so far, that
has the true Sage ring to it.

BREAKING AWAY FROM PARTIES
It is the vice of all organizations that
they begin very early to substitute
themselves for the causes which they
are supposed to represent. From the
professional politician s standpoint a
man who votes a Democratic ticket
one year, a Republican the next and
then a third party ticket is a vacillat
ing, uncertain and inconsistent indi
vidual. Why the professional politi
clans detest him is plain enough, but it
may, be that in voting with a different
party each year he is consistent In his
loyalty to political principles.
Partisanship, against which George
Washington warned his fellow country-
men in his farewell addTess, is the bane
of our political life. Wherever the ma
jority of the voters can be depended on
to support one party the self-seekers,
the professional politicians -and the
political crooks will certainly get con
trol of the party organization, dictate
its policies and its candidates in their
own interest and depend on the voters
to support, them at the polls, no mat
ter what they think of the policy or
know of the candidates. Where the
managers of the political organizations
cannot count on popular support un
less they give popular satisfaction they
become a little more careful about
keeping their pledges and a little more
fastidious in their selection of candi
dates. Philadelphia Record. .
SOME CALL IT SPORT.
Deer . hunting - in Massachusetts
shocks the tender hearted and hardly
edifies the true sportsman. A factory
was closed two days ago that all hands
might go deer shooting, and the sport
is carried on largely in this wholesale
fashion, so that the panic stricken
creatures, treateed for fifty weeks of
the year like barnyard cattle, are
escaping as best they may into Con
necticut and other bordering states.
Every unskilled man or boy with
weapon at command is out for slaugh
ter, and the deer, if they have some
rudiments of the reasoning .faculty
must think that their human neigh
bors have suddenly gone mad. The
hunt under natural conditions is
noble and exhilarating sport, one that
brings a man near to nature, fills his
lungs with wholesome air. and his
limbs with a weariness that makes
sleep sweet and' waking a delight, but
on any terms but those o.f hardship
patiently endured in the delicious wilds
of nature hunting is little better than
butchery. The populous districts of
eastern Massachusetts are no longer
the natural haunts of big game, an
our efforts to make them such hav
eventuated in a dangerous sort of ab
surdity. Boston Herald.

THE EVENING STORY
Tliat Interview.
(By Donald Allen.)
Miss Josie Morris was on a visit to
her college chum and best friend,
Florence Grey. Miss JoBie had arrived
at the dignified age of twenty, but
was still referred to by her acquaint
ances as "that mischievous minx." On
the contrary. Miss Florence, who was
a year younger, had dignity enough
for a woman of forty, and was not to
be compared to a minx, a fox, a wolf
or any other animal.
Mr. and Mrs. Morris had been call
ed away from their home for a Btay of
four or five days. They did not doubt
that Florence could manage things
during their absence,- but they did
not take that little "minx" into con
sideration.
Something was wrong with the
auto, and it was not to be taken out
of the garage until the father re
turned. Hehadn't left the house an
hour before Miss Josie was planning
to have it out. She pestered and pro
tested and coaxed, and when the
gardener had finally looked the ma
cnine over and said he guessed it was
all right if not speeded up. Miss Flor
ence reluctantly permitted herself to
be coerced.
Off they started one afternoon, with
the gardener at the wheel, and at the
end of a mile they left the highway,
dodged a telegraph pole, tore through
stone wall and brought up in a
blackberry patch. No one was killed
no one badly injured. They were
Just shaken up; and the auto was just
smashed.
The accident was heard of, and the
city editor of the "Eagle" assigned
reporter to secure the details in an
interview. The gardener, who had
just had his scalp wound dressed, said
that the thingumbob had suddenly got
away from the thingumjig,- and that
the first thing he knew he didn't know
anything, except that the boss would
surely give him the bounce when he
returned.
This was not enough for the
Eagle," It wanted thrills and sen
sations, and the gardener was sent in
to the house to see if they could be
had. A personal interview was re
quested with Miss Florence Gray. She
promptly replied in the negative, but
just aa promptly "that little minx"
came to the front with:
"Oh, it will be delightful All my
life I liave longed to be interviewed
for a newspaper, but it has never come
about."
Rut fattiOT-w ne ansrrv - -
"Then.' you needn't interview'. v Pll
attend to it.
"But you'll make a great long story
of it!
Of course I will; and, oh, Flor
ence, we can have some run out or it
at the same time. We can make it
the greatest interview of the twen
tieth century!"
What do you mean?" her friend
asked.
'You needn't come in
the room at
all. I'll tie a bandage around my head
and another around one of my ankles,
and I'll pretend to be deaf and dumb.
Get me a pencil and some paper. It
will be barrels of fun."
"But but "
But she had her way about it. The
reporter was shown into the parlor to
find one of the victims of the accident
nesting in a big easy chair, and he pro
ceeded to sav:
I am from the Eagle, and I shall
be much obliged for your story of the
accident. Were you speeding?'
Miss Josie fetched a groan and
wrote on a slip of paper: ' .
"I am deaf and dumb. You must
write out your questions."
By George, but this is rather in
teresting!" exclaimed the reporter.
Deaf and dumb, and a staving loos
ing girl at that! Too blamed bad,
First and only interview with a deaf
and dumb girl."
And he wrote out tne question ne
had asked before, and she wrote in
answer:
"No, we were not speeding. We
were just passing a swamp, ana J.
think- a bullfrog came out and at
tacked one of the front wheels. I
felt the machine give an awful shud
der, just as a strong man does when he
is shot and death comes to him.
"She can't mean that they were at-
tacked by a bullfrog, and yet sne says
so." murmured the reporter, "it n
make good copy, though. ..That will
come under the head of A New Dan
ger to Autoists Beware the Bull
frog.'
Then he wrote and asked her wnat
she thought as the auto left the high
way and she realized that a smasn-up
was Imminent, and sne replied:
"I thought of some popcorn I once
boueht at Coney Island. It was the
best ever. I wish I could find some
mnre like it."
Here's ingenuousness for you," said
the reporter. "She must be all of nine
teen or twenty, and yet she has the
mind of a eirl of ten. That will go
under the subhead of: 'Death staring
Her in the Face, and Yet She Thinks
nf Cnnov Tsland Popcorn!' "
Then he wrote and asked her if she
could remember her sensations as the
machine was plowing its way through
the stone wall, and sne-answerea:
"Most vividly. I thought I was in
my room and turning handsprings
over the bed and cartwheels around It.
I had Just turned a back somersault
and kicked a globe off the chandelier
whn the auto Btooned.
. "By George, but she may be a circus
or a vaudeville girl!" exclaimed the
reporter. "No, she can't be. Her
father is a church deacon and in the
Iumher business. Never heard of a
girl turning cartwhels in her own room
before. I'll make a daisy thing of this
intervew!"
Then he asked her if at any time
during the awful danger she felt the
sensation of fear.
"Not at all," was the reply. "On the
contrary, there was such a feeling of
contentment that I can not describe it,
I seemed ta be floating in the air on
angels' wings. I could look down on
earth and see an old woman frying
eggs and bacon, and oh, how I longed
for them; I tried to fly down for din

"By George! By George!" softly
exclaimed the newspaper man. "I'll
run that in under the subhead of:
'Bacon and Eggs and Grim Death.' "
Then he asked if she thrilled when

over me," she replied, "and then I
found myself picking blackberries to
carry home for a pie. I was cut and
bruised and shaken, but I did not feel
it. I was languid. I was placid. I was
content. If death had come it
would have been painless. I think

the young man called. He was met
by the conscious-stricken Josie, who
blushingly began to- stammer excuses,
but was interrupted with:
Will you please 'tell the deaf and
dumb young lady that I would like to

"But I am she.'

How a Child's Mind Works.
When a child shows an absorbing
devotion to an object which has noth
ing to do with his entertainment or
comfort, how is his mind working?
What does the object represent to
him? It haa come, by some strange
process of babyish reasoning, to Btand
for supreme beauty, and when he goes
further and for the sake of the ob
ject will endure hardship and venture
danger, isn't the child in the position
of the savage in regard to his fetich?
May not his devotion be called the
stirring of -the religious Instinct?
These reflections are prompted by
the behavior of a little boy 2 years
old, a little chap rather more than or
dinarily self-willed and intelligent.
His peculiarity first showed itself to
a week-end visitor a few minutes after
her arrival. He is very shy of strang
ers, and positively refused to have
anything to do with the newcomer.
who expended all her blandishments
in vain.
Then suddenly he came near, for
the moment quite fearless.
"Where did you get new shoes?" he
asked. "Did faver give 'em to you?"
The visitor acquitted father of any
connection with the purchase of the
ehoes, and the baby drew away again.
.After a brief interval he came back.
"Have .you got on stockings, too?"
he inquired. On being assured that
she had, the child inspected them
carefully and then again went away,
refusing to linger for further conver
sation. The mother explained - that new
shoes and stockings were the child's
chief earthly, joy. Some time before
his father had brought . home a' pair
of new shoes pr him. He put them
on, and for the . rest of the day went
about with an awed expression. At
night, when he was being undressed,
he begged to be allowed to go to bed
with his shoes on. He was told that
people didn't do that, was tucked up
protesting and left to go to sleep.
When the family got up from 'din
ner, an hour later, they heard sounds
of crying from the nursery. On in-
spection they found the baby sobbing
bitterly. He had been crying ever
since he was left alone because his
shoes had been taken from him. When
they were put on, sticking out oddly
from his little nightdress, he curled
up and went to sleep peacefully.
For days after that he walked care
fully, though by nature a tomboy. He
never ran out in the rain, his favorite
trick, because his shoes got wet. He
stopped stamping his feet when he
was naughty because it was bad for
the shoes. He could be got to do any
thing in the world by an appeal to
the shoes. " -
Stockings worked upon him in the
same fashion. If he did not go to
sleep as soon as he was left in the
nursery, he would climb out of his
crib, drag a new stocking from the
drawer, and fall asleep clutching it
tenderly. "Though timid with strang-
ers, ha would run up to passersby and
ask to look at their , shoes. Boston

"Passably," responded hte commit

"What's the mortality of this city?"
"About one a day-."
"About one, eh?": said Harte. "Come
