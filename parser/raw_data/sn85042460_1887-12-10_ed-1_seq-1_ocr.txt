similar circumstances to those which

HARPER'S STORY
A Sweeping Denial of the

POSITION OF THE FIDELITY.
He Says That its Funds Were Not
Used iv Operating the Chi
cago Wheat Deal.
(Associated Press Dispatches to theBSBAUt]
Cincinnati, December 9. — This
proved to he the most important day
in the II trper trial. Harper testified
in his own behalf and stated unre
servedly that he never gave an order
of any kind to Kckert to buy grain for
hitn in Chicago, and ho was equally
sweeping and explicit iv saying that
he never authorised Wilshire to huy
grain for him in Uhldago or else where.
This is the point of the wljole case
and in dire't conflict with the testi
m my offered by Wilshlro and Eckert,
Witnesses then asked permts-ion to
explain Wilshire'* check for
$10 030 in October, hut was stopped
by the Court. He said that it was
not given for the wheat deal but to
pay bonds wh.cll Wilshire hypothe
cated without authority. Wilalll c
had mortgaged properly lor $1-10,000
unit explained lo him that he did so to
make good that sum of money taken
from his father's c tite and sunk hy
him in wheat. Ha explained also

At Wilshire'* suggestion, and after
again denying that a dollar of the
bank's money or his own went into
the wheat deal, went on to tell of the
crash, how Wilshire and Hopkins fol
lowed iiiin io uoman s, where he
dines, and with tears iv their eyes
begged him to let them have more
money. Hopkins suggested tele
graphing to tlie bank iv Chicago to
see how much they would take to
carry the deul through, nnd Hopkins
sent such a teleuram to Ihe American
Exchange Bank of Chicago. When
witness returned from dinner he found
a telegram on bis desk from that
bank saying that if Wilshire was there
next morning with $(100,000 it would
be sate. That was where Kershaw &
(10. had their account. He told how
Wilshire, Hopkins and be talked

Johnson and Colonel Hournoy ap
peaxed for the prosecution, and Foote,
Henley and Gates for the defense.
The defendant occupied a seat beside
his attorneys. Attorney - General
Johnson asked to have the case set for
December 19 h, which met with ob
jection from defendant's counsel and
Col. Flournoy as well.
Mr. Foote 'stated that it was impos
sible for Hall McAllister to Vie present
for two weeks, as he was en»? HLiti
Ih trial of a case in San Bert. uno.
and suggested a continuance until the
25th. This did not subserve the con
venience of the Attorney-General,who
has to depart for Washington on the
26th or26th, to be present at the argu
ment of the railroad tax case. After
argument it was agreed to set the case
fur 'rial on the 24th of January, 18*8,
and the trial will then be proceeded

the Attorney-General's Inability to be

For $200,000 and four drafts on the

--(100. Wilshire was afraid to carry the
money lest it be attached, and it was
arranged that (iahr should go with
him. Gabr was Instructed not to give
up tho money without guarantee.
The second note was In cipher and
Eiarper said it related to the same
sort oi transaction.
The third note he explained by say
ing that Wilshire told him he had to
pay for a lot of wheat on May Ist.
"He wanted me," said Harper, "to
furnish money for this purpose, and I
refused. I advised him to sell May
wheat and huy June and pay tho dif
ference. Ho asked me to write a
memorandum telegram to that effect,
saying: 'Please chango that May
wheat I have not provided for to
Juno -.nd July; my principal has de
cided,' etc, Ho represented to me
that he was buying largely for Cleve
land parties, and that is what I sup
pose he relet red to iv the words, 'my
principal.' "
NOT VET SATISFIED.
It seemed lik<3 presotnption after
the sweeping denial of Harper t hat
he had ever in any way ordered Wil
shire to buy wheat for him hi Chicago
or .elsewhere for his counsel to hand
him t -day litre notes bearing the
initials''O. K. IL," and ask him to
explain. Ha'per said that when
Wilshire, in March, still owed the
bank and him those large sums, he
insisted on his selling out his wheat
so as to pay his debts. Wilshire said
that to do so safely he should buy
wheat that day to keep up the market
and then ho could sell out to advan
tage the next day.
Tlo asked mv advice," added Har
per, "and I said to him. 'Makeout your
order h, buy .1 une w heal. If V Is all light
111 O.K. it.' Mr. ilshiie sent to the
bank this note, saying Knit he was
goinj lo buy that .lav 180 000 bushels
oi wheat, and 1 O.K-'d it. It was no
act or aocoii it of mine in any shape
or form. Tue books of the hank Will
show, I think, Ibat ho paid the bank
a considerable amount of money the
next day. 1 had no purpose whatever
in ibis transaction except to get money
for tiic hank that was owing it by
Wilshire."

The World says: "The Maine
statesman interview is in fact a proc
lamation that Hhtine considers him
self to be the chosen champion of pro
tection, and that he is rea ly to enter
the Presidential lists as such. Presi
dent Cleveland stands tor this pur
(lose. lllaine conies forward as the
champion of the opposite idea. The
Democratic party could not wish for a
better issue."
The Sua says : "If Brother Blame
entertains such loose notions of rela
tions between the Federal govern
ment aud States, it strikes us that be
would be a conspicuously unlit person
to intrust wdtb the management of the
nation's financial affairs."
The Chicago Tiibnue says: ' Blame,
presented the high tarill* protect on
from a partisan point of view as the
opposition issue to the President's
view on tariff reduction. Blame's
interview will have to stand upon its
merits, and it will be indorsed or con
demned in accordance with the value
of the arguments set forth, and public
judgment will not be influenced by
the distinguished name behind them.
It is the weakest ground Blame has
ever yet occu| ied, and no national
party can expe.it to go into a presiden
tial campaign on that issue, no matter
who may be its leader, and win. The
surplus question must be settled in
some way and in a different way from
w hat it has been settled. It cannot
lie settled in accordance with the
lllaine idea."

following language: "The Depart

have some continuous service before

of Captain Bunce are valuable and
entirely proper, and doubtless

gation from the Evangelical Alliance
of the United States. I understand
the purpose of the Alliance to be ttie
application of Christian rules of con
duct to the problems and exigencies
of social and political life. All moat
admit that the teaching of Christianity
results in tbe pu est patriotism, tbe
most scrupulous fidelity to the public
trust and in tbe best type of
citizenship. Those who manage
the affairs of the government are
hy these means reminded that the
law of God requires that they should
he courageously true to the interests
uf the people and the mler of Use
universe will require a strict account
of their stewardship. The people,
too. are thus tauuht that their hap
piness and welfare will be promoted

ination lines. There is enough work
in the field you have en
tered to enlist the hearty co-operation

posed to imperialism and socialism.
The bible, Sabbath and iherly of con
science must be defended ; co-opera
tion should not bo political, and
church and State must be separate.
Christianity must stand for itself
against tbe attacks of ultra moutati
ism.
Rev. Dr. Gladden, of Colum
bus, Ohio, Si id iho unity in
evangelistic labor is good If the alle
giance of individuals to a particular
church is not destroyed. 'Iho best
parts of towns have twice as many
churches as are needed, and the poor
er fur too few. The unreasonable de
mands of workingmen must be modi
fied by reason and love. Missions
and a personal activity among the
poor is necessary.
