ADIRESS OF THE EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE As
TO TIIl PisOPLt. OF LOUSIANA. ot
The Constitution of the "Southern Rights Asso- for
elation of the State of Louisiana," unanimously W,
adopted by the mass meeting held in Odd Fellows' wt
Hall, Friday evening, November 23, 18i0, made it
the duty of the Executive Committee, appointed in ire
pursuance of its provisions, to publish an Address ea
to the people of the State. pa
A brief reference to the causes which led to tile w
organization of this Association and the construc- It
tion of the committee is necessary. The first meet- thi
ing was held on tie 10tll of November-four days Le
after the Presidential election-when it was defl- do
nitely known that the Abolitionists had triumphed.
and that the most odious sectionalist in the land de
had been elected to the Chief Magistracy. The qu
meeting was held in Armory Hall, and was pa
altogether an impromptu affair. A common in
danger obliterated all previous political divisions; du
a common interest animated the whole vast assem- eq
blage; and a common patriotism bound them to- Icl
gether with links which can never be broken. A to
committee was appointed to report a Constitution eq
to a subsequent meeting. The adjourned meeting fes
was held, thirteen days afterwards, in Odd Fellows' an
Hall, and the Preamble and Constitution, which are th
appended to this address, were unanimously and of
enthusiastically adopted. ea
I The adjourned meeting was one of the noblest
ever held in New Orleans or elsewhere. When
it adopted the Constitution it spoke the voice
of the people of the commercial metropolis of
the South. That voice will be heard when the
time of trial comes, and it may be depended
upon. The people of the country will give it
volume and strength; and Louisiana will not be
found in the rear of her Southiern sisters.
We need not review the history of the slavery
question. It is famtiliar to us all.
The P'reamble to the Constitution of the Associ- or
ation is so concise and comprehensive, so clear ar
and incontrovertible, that it leaves little for the cc
committee to do in the way of making up an in
dictment of grievances asgainct the Northern
people.
We have been deprived of our constitutional
rights and robbed of our property when we had oc
Presidents willing to wield tihe power of the Ex- a
ecutive Department of the Gcovernmen t in our de- di
fense. Wiat will be our lot whe an an Administra
tion chosen on a basis of bitter hostility to our in- a
stitutione assumes the functions of government? e,
We need not answer this question. A proper re- It
ply will at once suggest itstlf to the minds of all
intelligent men. We will only say, if we would be it
free, great and prosperons-all of which we can
command by judicious, prompt and united action- tl
we must meet the issue forced by the North It
bravely and unflinchingly. None but slaves in
soul are ever enslaved in body. The real freeman ri
hews his own path to enlightened liberty. As it is
with individuals, so it is with nations.
The cotton States constitute a mighty empire S
within themselves. We have all the essentials out C
of whicih to create a great nation. We have a mo- o
nopoly of the product upon which the commerce of
so the world depends. We have a soil of unbounded g
fertility and a climate of surpassing salubrity. We
produce, or can produce and manufacture, every
thing needful to sustain ourselves at home, and
have two hundred millions dollars surplus to sell
abroad. We have as intelligent and as brave a l
people as the sun ever smiled upon. Give such a
people and such a country a good government, and
they will speedily become one of the wealthiest
and mightiest nations of the earth.
This will be our condition if we go out of the
Union: but vassalage, impoverishment and de
gradation, will be our lot if we remain in the
Union, so truly as the history of the past is a safe c
,, standard by which to judge the future.
But, the question is asked: Can the South with
om draw from the Union rightfully? Let us examine.
The Constitution was adopted " to form a more
75 perfect Unionl, establish justice, insure domestic
tranquility, provide for the common defense, pro
mote the general welfare, and secure the bless-i
l igs of liberty to ourselves and our posterity."
The action of the Northern States having nulli
fied all these pledges, and forfeited every promise,
express and imphied, the Southern people have a
right to judge and act for themselves.
On this particular point it may be well to cite
some authorities. Thomas Jefferson, referring to
the Constitution of the United States, in its relation
to State Sovereignites, said: " As in all other
cases of compact among parties having no com
mon judge, each party has an equal right to judge
for itself, as well as for the iifractions, as of
the iaole and measure of redress." Daniel
Webster said: " I do not hesitate to say and
repeat, that if the Northern States refuse will
fully and deliberately to carry into effect that part
of the Constitution which respects the restoration
of fugitive slaves, the South would no longer be
bound to obserce the compact. A bargain broken
on one side is broken on all sides."
All the just powers of Government are de
rived from the consent of the governed: and
to employ the language of the Declaration of In
dependence, whenever any government becomes
destructive of the ends for which it was formed,
" it is the right of the people to alter or to abolish
it, and to institute a new government, laying its
foundation on such principles, and organizing its
powers in such form, as to them shall seem most
cIa likely to effect their safety and happiness." It
is undeniable that the Government of the United
States has been perverted from its original ends;
that it has become destructive to our peace, prop
erty and safety; and we claim that it is our right,
as well as our duty, to alter or abolish it, as we
shall deem most conducive to our " safety and
happiness," and to institute such new government
as we may think most expedient.
The Legislature of Louisiana will assemble on
and the 10th of December, 1860. Its first act should
be to order the election of delegates to a
Convention. That Convention will embody the
sovereignty of the State, and ought to be called as
e early as practicable. Other States will be in Con
vention and Louisiana should be in Convention
also, in order to be preprced to act as circum
stances may dictate. Too much care cannot be
exercised in the selection of delegates. Weighty
nffairsrequire dcliberaote consideration. Old party
lines should be tholroughly ignored; and none but
men of the hIighest ccapacity, patriotlism and intel
ligence, shouild be choseni. When thie Convenctioni
imoves, it should miove with a sufiienct mlorcl in
flueice to commanoi the ii ndivided c pprobation of
all the palciotic peolie of the Commonvwealth.
This can be easily ellected, if able, hIonest, faithful
representative men, Southlmern in feelig, are elect
ed to thie Convention. icc no other way can this
result hbe cconmplihicd. Vro call upon all our
ciczreln toi heedlr ticnAtoiee
When the Convention meets, the policy .of our
sister Southern States will be well developed, and
it can govern itself correspondingly. Louisiana
should be prepared to cooperate with her South.
ern sisters at the proper moment, and she will be
derelict in her duty and false to her high position
if she fails to do so. But she will not. Decided
and inflexible, but prudent and discreet, she will
array herself on the side of truth, honor and jus.
tice, and will umnuailingly meet whatever trials
and responsibilities the future may have in store
for her. The mighty stream which divides her
magnificent delta is not more irresistable in its
current than is her determination to stand by her
Southern sisters in all righteous and patriotic
caus learticules
We beg leave to direct particular attention to
Article 10 of the Constitution of the " Southern InL
Rights Association." We earnestly urge the form- en
ation of auxiliary Associations in every parish in
Louisiana. Too much importance cannot 'be at
tached to the suggestions of this Article. Wherever
Associations have not been formed they should be
formed immediately, and should communicate
forthwith to the parent Association in New Orleans.
We invite early and cordial cooperation. In this
way great and lasting good can be accomplished.
We also invoke the attention of our fellow-cit
izens to another recommendation contained in the
same Article. Let Minute Men and Volunteer Com
panies be organized without delay. Let the stal
wart sons of the State prepare for all emergencies.
It will be the duty of the Legislature to provide
them arms and necessary, equipments. That the
Legislature will promptly do so, no reasonable
doubt can exist.
With this exposition, your Committee confi
dently entrust the determination of this great
question to the sovereign people. As it is ap
parent that we cannot have equality and justice
in the Union, it is our highest and most solemn
duty to ourselves and to posterity, to provide for
equality and justice out of it. The alternatives
left us are freedom or slavery. We are compelled
to choose between them. To obtain freedom and
equality and justice, we must withdraw from a Con
federacy that has refused each and all these to us,
and which boldly threatens the direst oppressions in
the future. Our sole hope-our our only chance
of escape from the vilest thraldom-lies in the
early organization of a Southern Republic.

amble and Constitution were unanimously adopted:
COvSTIIn'TtOn OF THE o')OTII FRone RIuTr AF90
InA ATvlNT OF Lt 'lIS:.tA;A.
Whereas, We, citizens of New Orleans and of the
ltate of l.oui iana, ignoring all former political ties,
namt s and association,, have met for the purpose
of declaring our sentiments on the present moment
ouis crisis it the history of our country, and to form
a Soutliern party and state its objects, feel that a
due regard for tile opinion of our tellow.men impel
us to avow the reasons and causes for such a step,
whlich are made up by the history of the insults,
aggressions and wrongs heaped upon Us as South
ern men by those who should be our friends and
bIrethren, but who are really and in fact our worst
enemies-we mean thle Northern portion of this
Confederacy. In support of which we submit the
following facts
They have for more than thirty years assailed
the institution of African slavery in tile South, and
have made our Federal Legislature a grand instru
ment for incendiarism and Abolition.
They deny to us a common property in our Ter
ritories, acquired equolly by our money and blood, (
on the ground that the people of tile South, with c
their institutions, are not worthy to colonize them.
They have passed laws in a majority of their
Sltate Legislatures nullifying the provisions of the
Constitution of the United States for the recovery
of fugitive slaves, and the laws of Congress passed
thereunder, and made it a criminal offense in any
fone to aid in the execution of these laws of Con
gress.
They have rendered representation in Congress
of no avail to protect the interests of thle South
and thus taxation without representation is prac
tically enforced over us.
1 They have proclaimed that there is a "higher
a la" than the Constitution and laws of our coan
try, and that they will disregard their oaths and
d trample upon our rights.
They have organized associations to steal our
t slaves and prevent their recapture, and have mur
dered their masters in seeking their rendition.
Tlhey have invaded Southern soil and murdered
our unoffending citizens, aud men among them,
high in position and office, have bestowed praises
and eulogiums upon the assassins--whilst the e- t
cotires of several of their States refused to deliver
partics implicated in these crimes, upon proper I
and legal requisitions.
They have sent seditions pamphlets and papers I
Iamongst us--whilst sixty-six of thleir mcmbers of
Congress endorsed " IHe/per's llpending Crisis,"'
an incendiary book and utterly subversive of
Southern rights and safety.
They have sent emlissaries amongst us to burn
out towns, and distribte anrms and poison amongst
our slaves to desolate the South.
By their fanaticism and intolerance, they have
compelled us to separate from them in our churches
Sand other religious institutions.
a And recently, as if to add the crowning insult
and wrong to tile long ctalobgue, and to comlpel
e to declare as sevrered the last tic thlt binds tus
to tether as a nation, with lce choice of three ia
tional and conservative candidates, they have, by
a large lnajority of a stricty sectionllal vote, elected
or Abraham Liucoln and Hannibal IIlamlinto the Iligh
a. oflices of President and Vice-President of tile
United States-representative men of all that is
o dious and unjuast to the Soauth--Bilack Republicans
in name and Aboliionists at heart; the first of
el whom is the author of the doctrine that there is an
Id tirrepresseible coctilicl belreen the Nortlh and
I- South.," and has openly avowed that lie will disre
gard tlle decision of the Supreme Court of the
rt United States declaring it thle right of the South to
n carry slave property into the Territories. And
sbelieving as we do that, by these declarations and
acts the Northern States have virtually subverted
t the Constitution and dissolved the Union, and that
the only safe-guard for our rights. property and
o- liberties is in protpt action; therefore, we agree
td to form a political association, as provided in the
following :
ARTICLE 1. This Association shall be known and
designated as the " Southernighs Association of
the Slate of Louisiana."
ART. 2. The objects of this Association shall be
to encourage Southern independence of interest
and feeling, and to promote concert of action
amongst the Southern States. And should any
State or States, in the exercise of their sovereign
right, withdraw from the Union, and the Federal
(Government attempt coercion, to extend to such
State or States our cordial support and sympathy ;
to use all honorable means to bring about, under
tile sanction of a State Convention, the withdrawal
of the State of Louisiana from the present Union,
and the assertion of her independence and sov
ereignty and, finally, to promote in every way
the estbhlishlsent of a confederated government
of the Southern States, or such of them as will
unite for that purpose.
ART. 3. This Association shall be composed of
citizens of the State of Louisiana.
ART. 4. The officers of this Association shall con
sist of one President, one hundred Vice-Presidents,

vened for tie adoption of this Constitution.
AnT. 5. The Executive Committee shall be
charged with tile general manuagement of the
attfirs of the Association ; they shall select their

shall constitute a quorum for business.
Airt. 6. Elections for officers siall take place
annually, clutommencing from the date of the adoption
of this Constitution.
AlT. 7. The Executive CUmmittee shall have full
power to enact By-,awsafor tlr governnmentgof tlhi

thtia Constitution. They shall hlive hltl power to
appropriate the funds of this Associationt for the
advancement of the objects set forth in Article 2d,
to fill vacancies occurring in their Committee for
tile uncxptired ternt, to appoint from their own
ody, or from tile Association at large, such Com
mittees as may from time to time seem necessary,
and exercise generally all the powers contemplated
in the formation of this Association.
Asr. S. The Executive Committee shall meet not
less than once in each week, on such day and at
such hour as they may designate in their EBy-Laws.

the Executive Committee, or whenever he may
deem necessary.
ART. 10. The Executive Committee shall, as
early as practicable after the adoption of this Con
stitution, issue an address to the people of the
State, setting forth the objects of this Association,
urging the organization of similar Associations in

c,operatioa, and earnestly recommending the or
ganization of Minute Men and Volunteer Compa
nies throughout the State.
After the adoption of the Constitution the follow

TALK ON 'CHANGE.
Though a better feeling was observable on s
Car'ondelet street yesterday, with larger sales of d
cotton than on the three previous days, there was
a desire to wait and hear from New York. The
long and short of all this apparent dependence on
New York is, that we have been trifled with. New a
York cannot help New Orleans in the present i1
emergency; it has as much as it can do to take
care of itself. A large majority of the sixty banks
in New York City would sooner aid the grain bills
than they would bills based on cotton or drawn e
against cotton. The telegraphic dispatches from
New York received yesterday only strengthen the
opinion that the New York banks will suspend
that they are only waiting to hear from Europe.
Mais, n'imporle, we will look at home, talk of home
and await the coming of events.
The arrivals from sea and from the West serve
to keep up a lively state of affaies on the levee.
The receipts of cotton were light, very light, yes
terday. Planters are in earnest in holding back,
particularly those who are free of debt. It is hoped
that none who have received advances will refuse
to send forward and protect their factors. The
stock of sugar and molasses on the great depot is
liberal. The gimlet rangers are in good humor,
but they keep somewhat " mum" about that Black
Republican grocer hailing from Boston, who was
on the depot last week buying or desiring to buy
some few hundred hogsheads for the Boston mar
ket. Many of the Northern and Western dealers
or buyers of sugar and molasses are growing wiser
every day, more discreet; do not give any expres
sions whatever about politics. Some of them seem
to appear as though they never heard of Abraham
Lincoln.
Among the most gratifying events of yesterday
was the announcement that the repairs on the
Jackson Railroad are so far completed that the
passenger and freight trains will be running in full
operation from and after tomorrow, the 5th inst.
The mails now go regular, as before the recent
storm.
There appears to be some difficulty (as in other
places) in Memphis about moving cotton, on ac
count of the difficulty in exchange matters. The
last week's receipts in Memphis reached 19,500
bales. The stock on hand there now is 41,793
bales. The total receipts at Memphis for the sea
son were 161,641 bales, against 155,208 bales same
time last year.
Of course there was some talk on the flags about
what Congress will do. Well, what will it do,
what can it do more than assemble, listen to the
reading of President Buchanan's message and refer
it to the different committees? For all the good it
can or will do, it might as well adjourn next Satur
day night, sie die. As most every one's mind is
1 made up about the secession movement, the only
talk on the flags regarding it is the great feeling
and unanimity in regard to the movement. If there
is a cotton factor appearing on our flags daily, or a
cotton broker of standing advocating or friendly
to conservatism, we should like to have him point
t ed out. Talking about factors brings up some re
1 marks about a proposed meeting to be held last
evening in the office of the Chamber of Commerce.
It was abandoned early in the day. The regular
meeting of the Chamber of Commerce was held
last evening, but the present crisis of allairs formed
n no part of their deliberations. A meeting of the
Presidents of the banks was expected to be held,
to talk on the present posture of financial matters.
If the convention agree on any movement it will
h be made public ; if it does not, there will be no more
talk about it.
In our talk yesterday we remarked on the entry
e in the log book of the steamsllip Gal\eston, as pub
lished in our marine list. Captain Cook, of the
n ship Jacob llorton, replies to the extract and re
marks. We should infer fIrom the direct denial and
11 explanation of Captain Coolk, there was some errorc
in the extract from the Galveston's log. We give
the Captain a hearing, and are gratified to learn,
e as we do from other and highly responsible sources,
1, that the owners of the Horton are entirely free
r from being Black Republicans. The ship is owned
. by Messrs. French, Iorton, J. H. Boardman and
1, Captain Cook, of Newburyport. iMr. French is a
d Breckinridge man; Mr. lHorton a Bell man, and a
member of the county committee; Captain Board
it man is also a Bell man. With the confirmation be
f. ore us of the views of the owners of the ship, and
tI the letter of Captain Cook, published below, there
n most be some error in the report of the Galveston,
y though the report speaks of Capt. Gray as master
y of the ship. It would be gratifying to us to have
s the exculpation of many other vessels and owners
a- from the charge of Black Republicanism in as sat
ie isfactory a manner as we have from the friends of
¾, the Jacob Horton and owners:
To Tbe PTdicor of the nsily C0pepcnt:
al Dear Sb--I notice the report in your paper thia
'' morning of the steamship Galveston having spoken
' the ship Jacob Horton off Saud Key, and that the
news of Lincoln's election was received with great
osatiefaction by me. Iyl not know why the Captain
of the ate amship shoold make sack an assertion. I
have been trading to this port as master of a ship
for twenty 7~are, and all with whom I have associ
ated know my views, and that they have always
been Democraic. I have never voted any other
than the Demoer.tti ticket at a Presidential elec
tion, and should have done so at the last but, sail
ing on the day befor the election, Nov. 5, had not
the opportnunity. I ws anxioos to know who was
elected, and made the iL'meuiry on the first opporto.
nity. On hearing the re suit from the Captain of
the steamer, I expressed monregret that such should
have been the result, for I w,0 in hopes that there
would have been no choice bY the people. This
wnas my object in making the bnqumry. I amno
politician, and never troubled .'s.ySelfabout pol
itics, but have always been oppose l to all the tsms
of the North, and I think the Soosth justified in
agitating this subject until they derive all the hone
fit to which they are entitled under t'ne Constilo
tion. By giving thi an insertion in yost columns
yen will much oblige,
HENRY COO~f
olCater ,..tlp Jacob ltirtme.
Giving Captain Cook the full benefit of our ex
tensively read columns, we close with his gold
ship without any further remarks.
As there was not muclh other talk going forward
on the flags, excepting money and exchange, we
had considerable talk, as it will appear, about New
England ships and owners.

Nes Yono, Dec. 3.-The Washington cnrres
pondent of the Now York Times says the mem

Tennessee and Kentucky, represent those States
as beiqt strongly in-avor of the Union.
The Union members suggest the reference of the
portion of the President's message relative to
secession, to be submitted to a committee of one
from each State-their decision to be final.
It is rumored that Mr. Seward will, this week,
offer conciliatory resolutions, and that prominent
members of both parties are engaged in making
compromise arrangements.
It is reported that a resolution will be thrust into
Congress at the earliest moment, declaring the
right of a State to secede from the Union at her
will.
The Pacific Railway Committee will report two
routes, a central and an extreme Southern.

ST. CtARtrea TcEATEt.--Miss Kate Bateman, tl
who left us some years ago as a juvenile prodigy,
a rosebud, last night made her reappearance as
an expanding and gradually ripening rose. To the
Romeo of Charley Pope, she was a Juliet suffi
ciently sweet. Bless Billy Shakspeare for invent
ing a character, or pair of characters, in which the
youth and sweetness of the girl may render ac
ceptable the responsive agony of the young or I
middle aged gentleman who may be cast to play
love to her without being supposed to feel it.
As long as pretty little girls shall be allowed
to bud into womanhood on the stage, we may
look for Juliets who will captivate; not by the
actual merit of their acting, but by that fresh
ness and sweetness, that overwhelehing charm
which Nature and Shaklspeare have conspired to I
offer-Nature in her never-ending succession of
sweet young girls--Shakspeare in his immortal
language of love and other passions.
Kate Bateman's Jet.iet, last night, reminded us
of Julia Dean before she pretended to be a "star."
We remember Julia's school-girl, semi-spasmodic
style, before she ripened into either the woman or
the actress. Kate, last night, brought up our old
recollections of Julia; therefore we have some
hope for Kate as an actress.
The theater was crowded. When Romeo died,
the whole audience were glad that they lived, for
J.iierl' sake--not on account of the splendid act
ing, but on account of the youth and freshness of
the actual young lady who died in the character of
the J7diet aforesaid. To-night, tie rather pleasant
Miss Kate will be Geralline, in the play of that
name.
VAs:nl:llr:- TIIe:ercT:.---A full and fashionablte
tI nditory ta usual luxeuiated lnst night. " She
Stoops to Conquer" and " Conjugal Lessons"
were, to speak in a quiet way, acceptable. We
wonat attempt to describe seriously the enjoyment
which was actually enjoyed. Our pen shrineks
from any attempt at descriptive. The feasts of
merriment and pathos which are nightly produced
at the Varieties cannot be understood in any at
a tempted pen description; they must be seen and
SIheard to be enjoyed and appreciated.
To-night we are tolhave the ever-glorious "School
for Scandal," so gloriously played at tie opening
of the theater; not to mention the farce, dancing,
etc. Read the advertised bill and reflect upon it.
' AcAn.EY or Music.-This is the last week of the

snipes, of both sexes, and vagroam darkeys, to dis
pose of.
Out of a gang of fifty or more, the following Hi
were the only offenders whose enormity entitled z,
them to dishonorable mention in the Crescent:
Edward Armstrong, f. m. c., found in this city and
State in eontravention of law; ordered to leave eh
witllin sixty daos. James Blurke, for offering to i
eat Mrs. Ann C. Totterman, in lieu of her husband, a
for whom he had a special appetite ; put under i,
bonds to live on christian diet for tihe nenot three
months at least. William Nelson, ior talking sul
phur to Charles McCauley and proposing to per'o- i
ratle him iistolorically, at the corner of Magaznioe e
and Girod streets; likewise put under bonds to

sider himself a better nman thaln G. Washington
N i.Rosen, a white police oflicer on St. Charles street;

what better than a nigger.
Theresa Merklo, aliso Cast Iron Mike, (the female
HIeenan of Dryades street, in whose house Pat
Owens was mortally wounded last Sunday night
week) for getting Brunk, and, per consrequence,
growing noisy and combative, t10 fine and twenty
days in prison. Not having the discs, she went
.down laughing; she laughs always, in prison, out

affable to the police; tie most complete rip of a

A. Langshart, (probably long-short) for loadings
himself to the nmuzzle with red-eye and "shooting
a pistol" on Iampart street, $20 fine or one month's
imprisonment. Whether the pistol was danger
ously wounded or not, did not appear. Langshart,
being short of pewter, went down with a long
face.
The only person who on thim dfstingnished oca- I

to reclaim the coat in which he was hnng at Har
per's Ferry, did, in his spiritual or spirituouls semb

James Meyers, on Girod street. Having no friaend
