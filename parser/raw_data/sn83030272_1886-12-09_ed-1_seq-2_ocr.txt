selfdefence
t Tlio Question of tho reduction of taxation I
a secondary and minor one compared to tbls
No American of patriotic feeling will grudge
I I 1 tho money which Congress may veto for tho
1 protection of tho seaboard and lakcboard
o This Is a matter which touches the pride
a well as tho prosperity of tho nation D
yond tho droad of tho all but ruinous disas
i t ter which a broach botwoon tho United States
W and any foreign power possessed of even a
few llrstclasa modern ships of war might
bring upon pur greatest cities Is thoifoellng of

what wo ought to bo able to demand as a right
f I Our Inability t repel attack from the BOA

be a more unsatisfactory position than t
f i denend unon our weakness or tho contemnt
L uous good nature of foreign nations for pro
f l tection Could there b a more dangeroua
I Improvidence than to take no account of tho
t h Chances of a war with some of these nations
I t and with niggardly folly t save tho few
millions of dollars which would Insure

I I Tho beginnings of the DOW navy are
already made under the skilful and hon
f 1 est direction of Secretary WUITMBV The
t i immediate and Instant duty for
Immeiate ad luat Congress
t a now Is tho preparation on an adequato scale
of coast defence No political squabbling no
effort at futllo horlzontalltles no attempts
J at superfluous and cranky legislation should
t delay the performance of this duty
g r There ha been a tendency t tryand make
1 i this matter of coast defences a party ques

I hould lead Congress to do this Without

I f The socalled LiberalUnionists who have
k deserted Mr GLADSTONE held In London on
I Ik Tuesday a meeting described as 0 I monster
It f conference and followed by a banquet of
I equally redoubtable dimensions Lord HAT
T XNOION and Mr QOSCHBN spoke at consider
f f 4 able length and letters were read from Mr
1 CiiAJiBEBiAiN and Mr JOH Bruonr Ybt
1 not a step was taken toward the formu
lation of 0 positive a contradistin
guished from a merely negative policy and
I If tho object of the conference was t supply
a reasonable pretext for tho existence of
LiberalUnionists a members of 0 separate
H third party tho demonstration must be
deemed 0 failure Anything to bat OLAD
STONE I Is 1 platform too narrow for uny
statesman who calls himself a Liberal to
stand upon and I Mr GOBOHEN and Lord
I HARTJNOTON after six months meditation
I can hit upon no better party cry their place
t 1 seemingly not at the head of an inde
l pendent organization but In the most buck
p ward section of the Tory ranks
The chief spokesman of the Unionists
Who by the way are represented by Just 73
members In the present House of Commons
assured his fellow secedors that siege would
i continue to bo laid to tho GLADSTONE posi
i tion which he bad the candor to acknowl
t edge had not yet been taken by storm When
j I wo remember that tho Gladstonlans without
I counting tho victories of their Parnolilto al
I lies carried at tho last election not loss than
t 196 seats Lord
lout Lrd UABTINOTOXS admission
1 ficcins to havo been called for and the threat
I ened leaguer of a fortress whoso defend
ers outnumber Its assailants nearly three to
one Is likely to offer a diverting spectacle
II I I The Whig chiefs notion seems to be that tho
p GLADSTONE stronghold will bo taken as was
I I t Jericho of yore Ho Imagines that all he
f needs t do will bo to beat tho drum and
sound the trumpet whereupon the walls will
i quickly tumble while the rank and file of
tho GLADSTONE Liberals will mutiny and I
rush out to join tho rebels The free trade
Tories who shared Sir ROBIBT PEELS dis
t comfiture long labored under a similar de
i lusion But somehow tho mountain never
lt came to MOHAMMED and the Poelltea gradu
ally crept into the Whig fold
That is precisely what will happen t the
LiberalUnionists who accept Lord HABTINO
TONs advice to keep Mr GLADSTONE out of
r i office a the sacrifice of all their old convic
tions What tho Whig leader dignified by
the name of line of action Is to consist
i
sist It seems in voting for anything tho
I Tory Cabinet propose on tho ground
that the removal of tho present
I Government would result In tho election
o of Mr GLADSTONE This confession la
0trangoly at variance with tho pretended
confidence In tho speedy absorption of some
I I K 900 Liberal members of Parliament by about
i 1 70 Unionists or in other words In tho abil
i ity of tho tall t wag the dog I It b true
1 aa Lord BAIITINOTON asserts that In the
a Lrd ITOTN ICl tat new
4 i election which might follow the defeat of
Y tho present Ministry Mr GLADSTONE would
i r triumph tho obvious Inference would b that
1 Homo Rulers are gaining while the Union
ikta losing

i No one can read Lord UARTINOTONS allusions
lusions to Ireland without perceiving that he
1 not only to all Intents and purposes a Tory
t but a Tory of tho stiffnecked and bitter
y I I typo When ho denies that tho present Gov
1 4 ernment is competing with Mr GJADOTONE
l for thn good will of Irish Nationalists ho Is
reporting a decision which ho helped t bring
I lout and which was not reached without
I etiououous opposition In the Tory camp
t itself However harsh may be tho policy
4 t which Lord BAiasnuity and his least
t generous colleagues have finally decided on
I I j Is J certain that two wcek ago Lout RAN
Down CiicnmiiLti and those Ministers who

Insignia of office when n Mr GOSCHEX said
on Tuesday has tho substance of power
and has vlrtuallydlctatod tho uncompro
mising course now adopted by Lord BALIS
Dual In the Irish business I
I is an odd position In which the old WhIgs
find themselves but It Is at least conceivable
that we may yet witness a still stranger
spectacle If a readiness t render a measure
of justice t tho people of Ireland Is likely
for some time t come t b tho decisive
political touchstone even more startling
transformations of tho existing parties
may in the end tko place I acorns
possible for Instance In view of his
speech at Bradford and of hIs recent
friendly attitude toward Ireland that Lord
RANDOLPH CntntoniLL could act moro har
moniously with Mr GLADSTONE than ho
could with Lord HAimNQToN and 69010 of
his own colleagues In the present Tory Cabi
net In connection with the suggested con
tingency of such now affiliations It Is worth
noting that Mr GLADSTONE has just written
a letter expressing cordial approval of Lord
RANDOLPHS denunciation of the London coal
tax for which It should bo remembered tho
Chancellor of tho Exchequer has been sharp
ly taken to task by Tory newspapers
Tko Case of tho Boy Zlrkle
A small boy with a demure face and be
hind It a noddle chock full of ghoulish glee
lives In Page county Virginia His last name
I ZIKKLE his Ort name probably Is TOIUIT
I will b safe to call him s until we havo
more definite Information Last week
TOMMY ZIBKLB received an appointment as
page in the United States Senate and I
ho 1 I already in Washington perform
ing his functions Although ho has hold
office only a week TOMMY ZIKKLB is already
an Issue In Virginia politics and there aro
some who say that ho will become tho con
trolling factor in deciding the political
tlng factr decldlnl poltca com
plexion of tho Senate after the 4th of March
thus exercising unbounded influence on the
course of national legislation and on tho
affairs of the American people generally It
Is a amazing success that tho young imp
has achieved since ho went Into politics
The facto those stated In Wash
fact ore th08 a stte a Wah
ington despatch to our esteemed contem
porary tho World One of tho Senate pages
who had been appointed on tho recom
mendation of Senator BIDDLEBBRCIKII
wont out of office because ho had reached
the ago of sixteen tho conventional limit of
pagehood Mr RIDDLKBKKOEB felt that It
was his duty to fill tho vacancy He
consulted SorgoantatArms CANADA who
expressed his willingness t oblige tho
Senator Mr RIDDLEBBROEB
Sator RIDDLEEOEB thereupon
named Toinnr ZIRKLE Certainly Sen I
ator replied CANADAT with great eager
ness I will appoint him at once
You con Immediately notify tho boy
and hIs parents RIDDLEBKOER went
away satisfied and told some of his Virginia
friends of tho good luck in store for TOMMY
6I What 7 said one of them That boys
father brought him down to this city last
Thursday and showed mo a letter from Sen
ator MoN In which It was stated that he
had secured from CANADAT
BUr CAAAyan appointment
for ZIBKLB and to bring him on and renort
with him at once t tho SergeantatArms
for duty That boy is now up stairs in tho
Senate Chamber at work
Apparently tho father of TOMMY Is an In
fluential citizen of the Luray Cavo region
whom both MAHONB and RIDDLEBEBOEB
were anxious t propitiate The two Vir
ginia Senators are at swords points MA
BONE got In ahead and RIDDLEBEBOEB
furious at what bo regards a the shameless
and mocking duplicity of tho Sorgeantat
Arms now threatens to vote with the Demo
crats t turn CANADAT out of office after
March 4 and perhaps to
4 ad reorganize tho
Senate offices and committees on a Demo
cratic basis la case that body Is a tie when
tho new Senators come In and bo has tho
casting tvot I All of these possibilities are
tho result of the appearance of young TOM
MY ZIBKLB In politics
Wo commend this flagrant instance of the
atrocity of tho spoils system to tho attention
of tho Mugwumps who aro working on half
time Just at present for lack of raw material
Why should two Senators of the United
States be fighting for the possession of one
potty offlco Why should momentous
national affairs b made t rovolvo about
tho diminutive person of TOMMY ZIBKLE
Why should not tho merit system tho
underlying principle of which is tho
surest guarantee of tho safety and success
of American institutions be extended by
law t the appointment of pages in the
Senate and House of Representatives The
pages sometimes become Senators as in tho
case of tho Hon AIITBUB P GORMAN of
Maryland In view of this possibility can
too many safeguards be thrown around their
original appointment
Here Is the real field for that extension of
the competitive system for which tho re
formers are anxiously waiting Tbo office Is
one t which the existing machinery of civil
service reform Is beautifully adapted Tho
qualifications of a page in tho Senate or In
tho House are definite and well understood
and tho fitness of tho candidate may bo
ascertne without much trouble by the E
amining Board Can ho cartwheel down tho
main alsio without upsetting a single spit
toon 7 I ho agile Is ho mum 7 C ho
pull a long face on 0 quarter of a seconds
notice 7 Can ho stand a sharp crossexam
ination by a Senators wife without giving
the old gentleman away 7 Can he spell cold
tea with a w and an ii1 and an sky
Those are the test of tho pages fitness I
they wore rigidly enforced in the original se
lection of appointees and I tho tenure of of
fice were made t depend upon truly impish
behavior without reference t such accidents
a the appearance of down upon the upper
Up wo should b spared scandals like tho
TOMMY ZIBKLE Incident

i
Wo printed on Sunday a considerable mass
of extracts from Gon MOCLELLANS
extraot McLLAN forth
coming book and these parts of It which
dIscuss MoCLELLANa relations with Secre
tary ST ANTON have been examined no doubt
with extraordinary Interest by the public i
The first Impression which overv Impartial I
man will derive from tho study of those pas
sages is that the author writes In I querulous
tone which detracts greatly from whatever
weight might otherwise attach to his state
ments No really strong man over whines
trod much of this book Is a protracted whine
Not having ben Intimately associated with
Mr STANTON until after the MCCLELLAN
eplfiodn wo are not able to speak from any
special knowledge upon the subject but
there In ono general consideration which iu
our judgment overbalances all the speclllo
and detailed accusations which Gen McCuu
LAN alleges
Mr I SrANTON was a man of Intense pur
pose and ardent passion and ho bad
prejudices and animosities but his great and
instant wish was t finish the war and
wve the Union To this end be WM seeking I
contInually lo a GteawrtU who could CPi
j
i ri
with L and break down and conquer the I
great army of the Confederacy Army
of Northern Virginia and In this search Mr
LINCOLN went with him at every step 8 I
that BTANTON did nothing tat LINCOLN did
not entirely approve After they had tried
MoCLELLAN and convinced themselves that
ho was not equal to tho job they next tried
BtnwJsiDE and next HOOK and when they
woro both found Inadequate they wero laid
aside just a resolutely and just as relent
lessly a McCLELLAN had boon Finally they
took GBAOT and ho did tho business which
none of his predecessors had been ablo to
accomplish
Theso facts wo think dlsposo of the wholo
of Gen McA long complaint Ol
Course It was not pleasing t him to b sot
aside nor was It pleasing to his friends and
the number of those was groat but tho 8
rotary of War could not consider either their
disappointment or MCCLELLANS On mortification
fication What ho was after was 1 General
who could boat LEE and wind up tho rebel
lion and at last he found him
That is tho wholo story I
Tho Men Who Keep Down Wnec
Mr Jimmy GEORGE has given his express
sanction to the doctrine that It Is tho
unemployed worklngmon who are tho chief
obstacle to an increase of tho wages and tho
shortening of tho hours of work of tho em
ployed In hIs speech at Sumnor Hall Bos
ton on Saturday evening ho Is reported assaying
saying among other things this
The man whe keeps GOWn wages In the UnlUd Stale
today the lan who make I la difficult shorten
hours le the Dneninloyetl man the man who It looking
for work driven by the ear of narration to adept R

prove the condition of the worklot matma like the row
ing of a boat ajcalnit a strong current
Mr GEOROE of course proposes his
method of land tenure as tho remedy for tho
evil but precisely how It would accomplish
tho desired result bo falls to explain
A wo havo said before thero Is moro
land now within twenty miles of this
city than can find purchasers or
hirers at merely nominal prices and
how tho transfer of tho ownership of
I t the State would make It moro desirable
we are at a loss t comprehend Unless Mr
GEOBOB shall come forward pretty soon with
a moro sensible and practical scheme for
tho improvement of worklngmcns con
dition wo shall compelled to set him down
as much less of a reformer than his friends
havo desired to suppose
A respected correspondent Inform that
t some of Mr CLEVELANDS mOlt important
recommendations the present Congress will
pay no hoed but this la what ha happened
to every ono of our recent Presidents Even
Gon GBANT had to experience the coldblooded
neglect of Congress shown toward propositions
which bethought a great deal of and u for
GARFIELD and AiiTiiun thoy fared no better
The Congress of the United States Is I very
Independent legislature and it often pays
very little attention to the serious wishes of
the most popular President
In response to TUE SUNS criticism of Mr
CLEVELANDS silver colic a wild and wander

I II not necessary to comment upon the
Idea implied in thle letter for we should ear
it carries with It unmistakable evidence that
Mr TILDKN never wrote It Possibly it may
represent Mr TILOENS view of silver at that
time though we have reason to doubt f but
such a method of expression was totally foreign
to his style and habit The Courier must have
bees imposed on I
Our valued and powerful contemporary

myielf of the conviction that If thee cxioldleraare to i

The readiness with which tko Herald has
withdrawn a erronaott eharc concerning
myself In Its article of Nov 18 headed Arthur
as ITesldentA lievlew of the Political History
of the OarfleldArthar Administration en
courage me t write to correct a taw other
ttoment therein which I know to be un
founded There are many more which I am
sure are untrue but about which I have not
porsonal knowledge
The charge is 1 made thatlfr Qoorge Bliss
yielded to temptation boca M It is I said O Mr
Bliss agreed to an arbltraUoa with tho Bali
bury who were friends of Elaine The as
sertions that Col Bliss was ever false to any
cause In which he was employed counsel
cannot possibly b justified He agreed t an
arbitration of the Star route cases against the
Sallaburys solely became of the lack of evi
dence to warrant criminal cnxaedlngs Ho
would moreover have beta perfectly willing
to prosecute any friends of Blame who
were guilty The assertion is made at
length and In various forms that Mr Blatne
determined to remain at the head of the
Stats Department or t be turned out The
Secretary of BUta supposed that he had suc
ceeded and that Mr Arthur would not dare
disturb him Tho Immediate quarrel with the
President which led to his quitting the Cabi
net arose from a breach of good faith regard
ing the Instructions given t Mr Trescott
Boon after Mr Blalne was forced to resign on
account of the difference of opinion between
himself and tho President on the South Ameri
can policy From that time on Mr Blame and
his family were strangers at tho White House
This enmity was Intensified b the result of
the last Presidential election and Mr Arthur
and his friends were accused covertly assist
ing by their indifference at least the triumph
of President Cleveland
This nearly all a tissue of falshoods The
resignations of tho member of tin Oarfleld
Cabinet were all placed In President Arthurs
hands immediately after be took the oath of
office before the Chief Justice on Sept 22 1831
In the VicePresident room while President
Garflolds remain were lying in the rotunda
of tho Capitol The President asked the sev
eral gentlemen to remain in office until there I
could h I fuller conference The next day
the funeral procession started for Ohio but
President Arthur remained behind Before
leaving Washington Sir Blame asked the
President at what date ho would probably
bo released from tho State Department and
the latter replied that be desired Mr Blame t
remain until the Yorktown celebration of Oct
19 should b over and the entertainment of the
French and u German visitor should b com
pleted Mr Ulalno or course consented to tna
Presidents wishes After the foreign visitors
had departed which was about the middle of
November Mr Blame still remained to assist
In tire preparation of so much of the Presi
dents message aa related to foreign affairs
Soon after Congress convened during Decem
ber and on ton day on which Mr Frellncbuy
sen bad signified that he desired to commence I
his official duties Mr Blame left the department
During all this period I saw Mr Blame frequently
quently and ho conversed with me freely He
manifested to me no desire to remain In the
Presidents Cabinet he signified no suob wish
to the President He considered change
Pre8ldent a ohaolo nat
ural and inevitable The President further
more urged him t accept the appointment of
Minister to England which Mr Blame declined
with thanks and they parted in a friendly
spirit I remember that Mr Blame said to me
that ho did not feel ablo to keep up such an
establishment In London as be would desire to
maintain He wrote a note to the President in
connection with his declination of the mission
which may perhaps be found among President
Arthurs papers or Mr Blame may have a copy
Tho differences touching some feature of
the South American policy happened after Mr
Blaine left the Cabinet the principal one of a
personal character between Mr Frellnchuyson
and Mr Blame Even this I think never
amounted to a total suspension of Intercourse
Mr Blame had given I public reception at his
house to the now Secretary but after a time
hospitalities coaxed though I think mutual
calls by card were never abandoned Between
the President and Mr Blalne personal rela
tions and exchange of hospitalities were kept
up Even when tho differences on tho South
American policy were at the warmest point
Mr lllaloo dined at tbe White House and the
President dined at Mr flames I am quite
sure that Mr and Sire Blalne woro Invited
to the White House two or throe times during
tho winter of 1881 and that the President
dined at Mr Blalne as lato a March1881
within three months of the National Conven
tion During the canvass of the nomination
in the spring and summer of 1881 many sharp
sayings were In circulation and the President
was much disturbed at times at the reports of
some of them and Mr Blame may have been
also Irritated butpersonal relation were never
terminated As lat as lastlspring when Mr
Blalne finished his Twenty Years of Con
grass he sent the two volume to Mr
Arthur with a kind Inscription and they
were accepted by a friendly note After
the Presidential election the Chairman
of the National Committee was indis
creet enough In a published interview
to Impute to President Arthur and the mem
bers of his Cabinet a want of fidelity and zeal
in the canvass This charge was baseless and
u > u L < L LL
w lD an unuiarou uy mo m tun uiuu lu n jouer t
tho New York Tribune All possible and ap
propriate assistance was rendered It could
not have been expected that we should super
sede the Chairman or do his work although It
would have been better I some one had done
so Mr Blalne hu never indorsed the Chair
mans aspersion to my knowledge In truth
thero is I much less bitterness certainly much
less personal discourtesy prevailing among
public men who are rivals than our prolific and
reckless newspaper writers would have their
readers believe Everything which doe hap
pen Is magnified or distorted
The herald of Saturday last states that I did
not speak to President Hayes on the late fune
ral occasion This I is untrue I greeted him
respectfully The refusal of Mr Blalne to al
oept Senator Edmundss hand Is to be
OIPt Emunds t regret
ted Mr Blames assigned reason wee that
two daY before there Mad been made public 0
letter written bY Mr Edmunds in the spring of
188S which Impeached Mr Blaloes personal
Integrity Hr Blame bad tbo right to draw
this Inference from the letter but consider
ing the surrounding ho should have re
ciprocated Mr Edmundas salutation lie
acted however from sudden Impulse and
thereby widened a breach which lIke that
with Mr Conkllng ought never to have ex
isted Wnlle Republican leader
Wnle our great epublcaa ladors
quarrel the party suitors and by reason of
ouch differences loses a Presidential election
It Is I for the Interest of the country that such
purely personal controversy should not arise
or continue between prominent leaders of
either party I is to be regretted that such
writers as the one whose letter to the Herald I
am considering and the Herald Itself should

that OeD Beaver Governorelect who is I t b
Inaugurated early In January wilt COOn assem
ble In this city conference of tho loading poll
tulane of his party t confer about the compo

S Hutan who maintains that Cooper Is Ineli
gible under tbe constitutional provision that
no member of the legislature shall be at >
pointed to any civil ofc during tlio time for

The jurists of thn State have been dUcuuIng
this queatlon for Never week and now that

the politicians It Is I generally believed Cooper
Is lee likely to b appointed than ho wax a
fortnight ago Should this so turn ontithe

Mr Frye said today I am not making any opposition

Morton upon these points i First ae 1 the propriety
of admIssion of foreign vessels 1 to Ameri
