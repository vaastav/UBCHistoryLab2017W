The day of the scrub has gone for
ever. This applies with equal force to
cattle or sheep. Pure bred bulls are
essential to maximum results, and the
maternity side of the herd is not to be
ignored. How to produce the heaviest
calf at the youngest age must be th*
aim of the western breeder. Quality
and condition are essentials. Idaho and
Montana sheepmen are now spending
money for rams that would have been
considered extravagance very recently,
and most of the cattle men in the west
are buying the best bulls available. The
Idaho lamb crop this year carried
more weight and fewer feeders than
ever before, and the process of im
provement, both as concerns cattle and
sheep, has barely commenced.—Chi

One of the matters •hich will be
affected by the position taken by the
president is the proposed enlargement
of the Interstate commerce commission.

Lawyers Ssy Missing Theater
May Not Be Pressoiited.
Cedar Rapids, Dec. 11.—Whether
"Vic Hugo" Claussen. former manager
of the Majestic Theater, may be prose
cuted under the criminal laws for em
bezzlement 1s a question that is caus
ing great deal ot discussion among
Cedar Rapids attorneys since the sud
den disappearance of Hugo on Wednes
day afternoon. Several attorneys were
questioned regarding the laws in thfs
connection today, and all said that if
it 1s shown that Hugo was a partner
in operating the Majestic be, can not
be prosecuted oh a criminal charge.
The question binges on whether it
can be shown that Hugo was a part
ner with, the owners of the building
in operating the theater. Under the
existing contract, the entire expense of
maintaining the theater, including de
preciation, taxes, etc., were paid from
the gross Receipts. When, these ex
penses were paid the .remaining re
ceipts were divided between the -own
ers and the manager on terms st&ted In
the contract
The gross receipts w&e deposited by
Hugo In one of the local banks, and it
ts s&ld that by reason of this fact he
was trustee of,the fund. However, the
money wliich Hugo Is accused of con
verting to his own use, was never de
posited Jn any bank, but was taken
from the receipts before the niuuv/
left the theater. Several attorneys
have said that op to the time the
money was placed In the bank," Hugo
was a partner with tin budding own
ers in safeguarding the funds. Under
the Iowa Uwrs ft partner can not be
prosecuted for converting partnership
funds to Ms own use.
No wort has been reeetved from
Hugo since be left Cedar ^Baplds in

It was learned tod# that lie drove to
