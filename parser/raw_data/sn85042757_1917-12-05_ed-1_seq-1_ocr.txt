A beautiful patriotic pageant, entitled
Red Cross Christmas Seals are sold
to fight tuberculosis. They have a uni
form puce of one cent each. Since
1908, when the American Bed Cross

An interesting display of agricultural
products and school work was exhibit
ed and prizes were awarded in the
corn growing contest.
Tuesday morning the bread demon
stration was conducted by Mrs. Cope
at the community cottage, thirty-four
adults and children witnessing the de
monstration.
Through a very clear explanation of
the reasons for using wheat, meat,
fat and sugar savers, and of the advan
tages secured by the use of the whole
cereals, through a series of careful
questioning, Mrs. Cope brought the
simple, but important facts of food nu
trition within the comprehension of
ven the children present.
After the bread demonstration a
few members of the Bed Cross Circle
remained for a demonstration in the
t making of the trench candles.
Tuesday afternoon a demonstration

HHnducted by Mr. 1 1 addon ait the heme

of making the eheese and emphasized

times as mu.-h protein. While the
whey, as a food for hogs, contains one-
half the food nutrients of the ekim
milk.
If the twenty million families f the
(Country would average using a half
.gallon of skim milk a week for .cot
tage cheese it would save about 00
millions pounds of valuable meat peod

Wednesday morning another cbecee
.demonstration was conducted by Mr.
Haddon at Crab Orchard at the home
of Mrs. C. J. Wheeler. Bulletins on
the making and uses of the cheese
were .distributed. This week the
Home Demonstrator expects to hold

United States into the war, reports
have come from Europe showing tuber
culosis to be a serious obstacle to vic
tory. In France 150,000 soldiers have
been invalided back from the trenches
with tuberculosis and the number of

has increased immensely with the war.

The control of tubreculosis is one of
the most important ways to conserve
the strength ot the nation in the su
preme test of this war. Everyone who
is allowed to sell Ked Cross Christmas
Seals is given an opportunity .to ''do
his tit m a way that counts, it is a
patriotic service.
The Bed Cross Seal sale is an educa
tional campaign no less than a means
of raising money. Everyone who takes
part in it helps to teach health as well
as to support health work, and success
gives double satisfaction.
In whatever state seals are sold, at
least ninety per cent of the proceeds is
used for anti-tuberculosis work there.
Not over ten per cent is paid to the
American Bed Cross ana the National
Association for the Study and Preven
tion of Tuberculosis to meet their ex
penses in supplying seals, advertising
matter and service and for the support
of her work.
Many hundreds of thousands of sol
. diers in the great war have been sent
home from the trenches wounded not
by bullets but by tuberculosis, and the
number of consumptives among the
workers and children at home has mul
tiplied. Thousands ot Americans ex
amined this year tor the army have
been found to be unsuspected cases of
tuberculosis.
In times ot peace tuberculosis has '
i been pronounced the disease that kills i
most and among the chief causes of '
poverty. Jn times of war it must be
fought doubly bard to strengthen our
army, conserve the strength ot the
nation and hasten victory.
Tuberculosis is preventible and is
curable if treated in time. The tight
against tuberculosis must be in educa
ting soldiers, workers and children on
how to avoid it, in shielding them from
infection by consumptives and in se
curing care and treatment for those
who have been infected.

J Pork can be produced as cheaply, if
not more cheaply, in Tennessee than
in the corn belt. The combination of
alfalfa pasture, clover pasture, pea
pasture and oats or barley, all cheaply
produced in comparison with corn, can

touching the primary election held in

FAKMEK AND THE NEXT YEAH
Word has just been received from
the food administration that in order
to encourage the tarineis to raise more
hogs, the an i ministration would use its
influence to see that hogs woula not
sell at less than 15 and one-half cents
per pound. This means that yeu will
receive not less an that price for
your hogs next year if the administra
tion at Washington can control the
market 'the meat situation is far
from favorable. Our armies must have
meat and the supply is short. Every

Lloyd George, in England and in
office, takes the ground that it docs no
harm to one's country and gives no aid
and comfort to the enemy if one tells
the trutn about past errors of judg
ment and procedure on the part of the
government.
Theodore Boosevelt, in America and
out of office, takes the same view.
There are those who think that the re
sult will be that Lloyd Ueorge will go
out of office in England and that Theo
dore Boosevelt will go into office in
America.

Entire War Expenditure for 1919 Less
Than for 1918.
Chairman Fitzgerald of the house
appropriations committee has given
out the following:
we must have both taxes and
bonds. This is not a matter of policy.
but of necessity. Neither means of
itself will raise enough money. We
are facing a period of unexampled
taxation. Nothing will escape."
Unofficial estimates of probable ap
propriations for the fiscal year ending
June 30, 1919, gave rise to the belief
that they will total from $3,000,000,000
to $5.0X0.000.000 less than the $18,000,
000,000,000 for the year ending June
10, 1918. This belief is based largely
on the premises that it is unlikely an
other $7,000,000,000 allied loan boud
will be presented this session.

Wednesday, November 28, at 11:30
a. m.. Fust Lieutenant Edward Joseph
Ducey and Miss Eula Lee Bishop wer
married In St. Patrick's rectory,
Washington, D. C, by Father J.M.Mc-
Naniara.
Miss Bessie Potter, who accompan
ied the bride to Washington to attend
the wedding and a few intimate
friends of the groom were the only
persons to witness the ceremony.
The bride wore a blue chitfon broad
cloth suit and carried pink roses. The
groom was dressed in the conventional
black.
The bride and groom letf for Phila
delphia in the atternoon and had
Thanksgiving dinner with friends ot
fhe groom. Thursday night they lett
for London, hio, via Columbus, which
place they reached Friday noon.
The bride is the second daughter of
the editor and wife and has been work-
rg for over ten years as typesetter in
this office. It is largely clue to her
ability on the typesetting machiie that
the chronicle has been ahle to contain
such a large and varied amount of
news of this section and the world in
general.
The groom is a graduate of Uose
Polytechnic, Terre Haute, Inl. He
was for two years with the govern
ment as highway engineer. It will
be remembered by many here that he
assisted in surveying the Meuiphis-to-Bristol
highway through this county
and it was while on that work that he
met the bride. He taught one year
in the engineering department of
Georgia Tech., Atlanta, Ca., also a
year in Pennsylvania State University.
The past year and a half he has been
with the Fort Pitt Bridge Company,
Pittsburgh, Pa. He is now an officer
in the engineering corps, United States
Beserve.
The bride will shortly return here
for a stay of some weeks while this
business is securing some one to take
her place permanently. They will re
main in London, Ohio, during the term
of his furlough, which was for ten
days.
