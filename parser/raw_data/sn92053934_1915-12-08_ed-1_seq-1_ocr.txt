telegram from Alexandria, P'gypt, re

American .steamship Communipaw, re
ported sunk off the coast of Tripoli
by a submarine, arrived at Alexandria

News of the fate of the crew of the
American oil steamer Communipaw,

officials of the Standard Oil company,
the owner of the vessel. Of the 39
members of the ship's company, Cap

company's shipping department. Mr.
Warden says that other members of the

States.
News dispatches from Rome that the
Communipaw . was sunk near Tobruk,
Tripoli, said that no information had
been received there concerning the

ITALY IS PRAISED
BY ITSJINISTER
Signor Orlando Refutes Statement of
Pope That Members of Iloly See
Have Been Mistreated.
Rome, Dec. 8, (8:60 p. m.) The law
of guarantees (regulating the status
of the papacy in Rome) cannot be re
garded as having resulted from nego
tiations between Italy and the papacy,
but Italy nevertheless upholds it loy
ally as one of the fundamental laws
of the Btate, without expecting any re
turn from the papacy, said Signor
Orlando, minister of justice, in his re
ply in the chamber of deputies to the
allocution of Pope Benedict. The min
ister spoke with particular reference
to the statement of the pope that cer
tain ambassadors and ministers ac
credited to the Holy See had been ob
liged to leave the Vatican in order to
preserve their dignity and the pre
rogatives of their officers. Signor Or
lando insisted that the ambassadors
and ministers to the Holy See who de
parted when Italy entered the war did
so of their own free will, after they
had been assured they were at lib
erty to remain without molestation or
interference with their prerogatives.
"If, however, they wish to make it
appear that they were forced to leave,
that is their affair," the minister con
tinued. "It is greatly to the credit of
Italy that during this unprecedentod
upheaval the papacy has been able to
maintain Its prestige throughout the
world.
"Cardinals from belligerent coun
tries, including Germany, have been
permitted to travel through Italy and
gather here for the consistory without
molestation. The same thing cannot
be said of other nations."
The chamber applauded this last re
mark of the minister, Which was in
tended as a reference to the report that
Cardinal Mercier, primate of Belgium,
had refrained from coming to Rome
for the consistory on account of re
strictions imposed by the German au
thorities. USED AX ON WIFE;

pagne district, is announced by Ger
man army headquarters today.
The official statement says:

dition to the prisoners taken three ma
chine guns fell into our hands.
"North of Souain, a position on hill
No. 193, over a distance of about 500
metres, was wrested from the French.
Four counter attacks were repulsed.
One officer, 120 men and two machine
guns were captured.
"On the front of Field Marshal von
Hindenburg's forces, local attacks by
weak Russian divisions were re
pulsed." Paris, Oct. 8 The French official
statement follows: "In Belgium our
machine guns last night prevented the
enemy from reconstructing the field
works previously destroyed by us in
the region of Ketsas.
'To the north of Arras, at a point
west of hill No. 140, our fire put a
definite check to a German attack, the
way for which had been prepared by
the explosion of a mine.
"During the day of yesterday our
artillery bombarded and destroyed the
Sainturin mill in the vicinity of Roye,
This position had been organized by
the enemy for defense.
"In the Champagne district we have
continued to make progress by means

MASS MEETING IS
HELD ON OSCAR II
New York, Dee. 8. Wireless advices
received today from the .peace ship
Oscar II, signed by Henry Ford and
prepaid, tell of a mass meeting held on
board last night at which extracts of
the message of President Wilson to
congress were read.
Some discussion followed during
which Ellis O. Jones, a writer of New
York, referred to the message as "re
actionary", and said it should not be
received in silence.
Twenty peace advocates constituting
the second contingent of the Ford ex
pedition to The Hague will sail this
afternoon on the Scandinavian Ameri
can line steamship Frederik VII for
Copenhagen. Most of the members of
the party were unable to make ar
rangements to leave Saturday on the
Oscar IL carrying the main Ford ex
pedition.
HUNGARIAN SEES
PEACEJLESSING
Former Premier Believes it a Human
Duty to End War as Soon as
Possible.
Amsterdam, Dec. 3, (via London,
7:40 a. m.) A long speech delivered
by Count Julius Andrassy, former
premier of Hungary, at the latest
session of the Hungary chamber,
dealt mainly with the possibility of
peace, according to a dispatch from
Budapest. This message quotes Count
Andrassy as follows:
"It is the human duty to make peace
at the earliest possible moment. I am
completely convinced that we shall be
able to conquer the most extreme re
sistance of our enemies and continue
the war until our adversaries are
forced to ask for peace, but it will be
a blessing if it were possible to con
clude peace before this last moment
comes.
"If, despite these considerations, I
do not now espouse definite action to
wards peace, the reason is that I am
convinced the time is not yet ripe.
The fact that on the other side I do
not see any sign of a possibility of the
conclusion of peace at present, pre
vents me from all actions toward
peace. Moreover, all signs demon
strate that our adversaries have not
yet acknowledged the present result
of the war and they are doing every
thing, in order, perhaps, yet to obtain
a change in the fortune of war. The
declarations of the French premier
and the speeches made in the house
of commons also offer in the present
circumstances little promise of an
early peace."
ST. LOUIS TO GET
DEMO CONVENTION
Washington, D. C, Dec. 8. St Louis
is the place and June 14th the date of
the next democratic national conven
tion. This was decided on by the demo
cratic national committee which had
completed Its work today after placing
itself on record in favor of the renom
Ination and reelection of Woodrow Wil
son as president. Complete harmony
characterized the proceedings.
St, Louis won over its rivals Chi
cago and Dallas on the second ballot
The vote stood St Louis, 28; Chicago,
15, and Dallas. 9. Immediately after
wards on motion of the TexaB commit
teemen, the choice was made unani
mous. Speaker Clark led the fight for
St Louis. He urged the city's claims
as necessary to keep Missouri in the
democratic column.
At the luncheon, President Wilson,
speaking briefly, told the committee
men the democratic party should be in
good order for the 1916 campaign be
cause It had earried out its pre-election
promises. Speaking, as he said,
"in the family," the president re
viewed the acts of the administration
since it came into power. The commit
teemen applauded him enthusiastically.
No other addresses were made.
The president, saying he did not
think It necessary to address the com
mittee In parliamentary language, said
that "any one who thinks we can be
beaten "is talking through his hat' " j

Driven Into Albania.
Berlin, Dec. S, (via London, 3: OS p.
ni.) It was announced at the war of
fice today that 80 cannon were taken
with the capture of the Montenegrin
town of Ipek.
The statement dealing with military
operations in the Balkans says:
"Near Ipek, SO cannon and much
war material were captured. More
than 2,000 prisoners were captured
yesterday.
Berlin, Dec. 8, (via wireless to Say
ville.) The Bulgarian war office re
ports, in a statement received in Ber
lin today from Sofia, that the French
troops in southwestern Serbia are be
ing pushed back farther along the Var
dar river. This follows the announce
ment yesterday that the French had
evacuated the Vardar salient. The Ser
bians who have been attempting to
join the allied troops also are said to
have been forced back by the Bulgar
ians, who have captured Rosna, south
western Serbia.
"Bulgarian troops contiued to pur
sue the retiring French along both
banks of the Vardar," the statement
says.
"Bulgarians occupied Besna, after
defeating the Serbians in the Bigla
mountains. Other Bulgarian troops
marched against Oehrida, northwest
of Ifesna.
"After a stubborn battle they de
feated the Serbians near Medovo and
Miriamorac. They are continuing the
advance again Oehrida.
"Other Bulgarian troops defeated the
Serbians in the Jama mountains and
ocupied Dibra, near the Albanian bor
der. They are continuing to pursue
the enemy in the direction of Stuga.
"The compilation of the amount of
booty abandoned by the Serbians in
Djakova and Kulatuma has not been
completed."
Heavy Fighting in Progress.
London, Dec. 8, (12:12 p. m.) With
the Serbian armies in retreat behind
the Albanian and Montenegrin front
iers, it is reported the bulk of the Ger
man and Bulgarian armies is being
concentrated against the allied armies
holding the southeast corner of Ser
bia. Heavy fighting has been in progress
there for the last few days.
There is no confirmation of hints
from various sources that the French
troops have been forced definitely to
abandon the positions held by them
since the beginning of the campaign.
The fall of Monastir and the south
ward progress of German and Bulgar
ian forces, however, have placed the
northern wing of the French expedi
tion in a precarious situation, and
withdrawal from the angle formed by
the Vardar and Cerna rivers apparently
has been begun.
Forces Are Arriving.
Constant arrival of fresh forces and
war materials at Saloniki give evidence
that the allies have no intention of
abandoning their efforts in this region.
Although the Germans have an
nounced the capture of Ipek, Monte
negro, the pursuing Austrian and Bel
gian armies evidently are confronted
with a harder task on the Montenegrii
frontier than elsewhere. The Monte
negrins continue to offer spirited re
sistance and to check the invaders
wherever possible by sharp counter
attacks. In Albania the Serbians, who
had been compelled to leave behind
quantities of war materials, appear in
capable of organized resistance. Even
an orderly retreat is made difficult, as
the Serbians are encumbered with
large numbers of civilians and pris
oners, and according to some reports
have been set upon by Albanians.
The latest dispatches state that the
French are bringing heavy guns into
action in the Strumitza section, caus
ing the Bulgarians to retire with heavy
losses. A battle of large proportions
between the Bulgarian and Franco
British troops appears to be pending.

Chicago Has
SecondBaby
A Defective
Chicago, 111., Dec. 8. A baby girl,
pronounced hopelessly defective, as
was the Bollinger baby, was permitted
to die in a Chieagc- hospital, it be
came known today because surgeons
declined to operate to save its life.
The child was Grace Werder, The
father, Julius Wrerder, refused to con
sent to the operation that, it is sup
posed, would have saved her life. In
agreement with Dr. Jacob Faltermay
er, the attending physician, as to the
medical problem, were Dr. Clarence
Rutherford and Dr. Harry J. Haisel
den, the surgeon who, a few weeks
ago, declined to operate on the de
fective Bollinger baby.
. The defective baby, according to of
ficial hospital records, was found to
have a hydroccephalic head, with
water tumors, and paralysis of the
lower extremities. It would have
been an imbecile, if it had lived, the
surgeons declared.
Although she had never seen her
Iaby, the mother agreed with the
physicians that the child was better
off dead. There is a striking similar
ity between the case of the Werder
baby and that of the Bollingers. The
Bollinger baby was the fourth child of
Mrs. Bollinger and Grace Werder was
the fourth daughter of Mr. and Mrs.
Werder. The Werder's three living
daughters are healthy and strong.
PAPER COMMENTS
ON WILSON TALK
London, Dec. 8, (1:37 p. m.) Ex
pressing the view that President Wil
son's denunciation in his message of
the activities of war plotters was too
mild in general and not sufficiently dis
criminatory between unneutral con
duct and criminal conduct, the Pall
Mall Gazette says:
"He even goes so far as to suggest
that the acts of an assassin or a dyna
miter are chiefly henious as exhibi
tions of unneutral conduct and that
equal censure must rail on every
American who fails to keep the scales
of judgment even and proves himself
a partisan of no nation but his own.' "
