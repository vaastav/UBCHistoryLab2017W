BALFOUR'S CABINET RESIGNS
The political crisis in Kngland reach?
ed a cliuiax yesterday when Arthur J.
Balfour, the premier, formally teiHered
the resignations of himself and tlie mem?
bers ol his cabinet to King Edward, who
accepted them. The King invited Sir
Henry Campbell-Bannerman to an in?
terview this morning, when be will ofl'cr
him the mission of forming a new cabi?
net. Sir Henry will accept the task,
aud within a tew days, even witbiu a
Iew hours, a new government will be
lormed.
A bricf otticial announcement was
made last night that the cabinet had re
signed, that the King had accepted the
resignation ol tbe minister* and that Sir
Henry Canipbell-Bannerman had been
M-nt lor.
It may be stated as certain thal Lord
Kosebery will be entirely ignored in
tbe makeiip ol the cabinet and that Jobu
Morley will be one of the chief advisers
of Sir Henry in drawing up the list of
his official family which will be presented
to the KiDg.
Mr. Moriey himself is considered like?
ly to go to tbe Indian Office, and it is
probabk that Herbert Henry Asquith
will be chancellor of theexchequer. The
foreign allairs pnrifollo will go either
to Lord Klgin or Sir Edward Orey.
though the latter is considered likely to
bfl made secretary (..: the colonies.
Tbere is some uncertainly as to when
the dissolulion of Parliament will be ef
fective, but it is not considered probable
until after the new year.
An iuteresting feature of the political
situation is the prospect of a closer al
liance between the IrisL and the labor
parUea in the new parliameut. James
k'eir Hurdie, thi socialist and indepen
detit inember, in a political speech last
iii^rlit I'raiikly invited such an alliance.
He pointed out tbat 4.ri labor members
coinlnned wiih 75 Irish members would
providfl a votimi strenglh which no
g ivernnienl, hoivever siroug, c >uld afloid
. i ignore.
There is no dotibt that the retiri ig
unioiiist ministry has been more or leaa
fidiug for a fall torsouietime. Mr. Bal
l mr, undoubtedly a clever man, it is
tbOBgbt, has l"'en t o much ot a dieamer
to hold bis party together, and he aaa
rntiraly ovonbfldo-cd by Mr. Chamber
lain, who ultimatcly dealt the deatbblow
to tbe party when he advocate.l taritl re
fnrm, the rock on which the government
plit.
Sir Henry Canipbell-Bannerman, the
new Premier, had been a meinber of
Pariiainenl in the liberal intereat lor ihe
Stirling district of Scotland since 1868,
and was born September 7, 1830. He is
the ycaageet son ol tbfl late Sdr .'ames
Campbell, and assumed the ad
ditional name of Bannerman under the
will ot his maternal uncle, the late
Hmry Bannerman ol Hunton Court,
Kent. He has had several important
positions during the past 30 years.
Twice Married; Twice Divorced.
Married aud divoreed twice in lesa
tliaii 11 years is tbe record made by Mr.
aml Mrs. Ralpfa Savage, a Winchesfer
coiiple. Mra. Savage was Miss M
\dah Pflflbrifht. and ibe husband was a
former business man of that city.
Judge Thomas W. Harrison, presid?
ing at the December term ot the Circuit
Court for Frederick county, yeaterday
-igned a decree granting Mrs. Savage an
Hbsolute divorce Irom her buaband.
Mn. Savage is given tl e right to reaume
her maideu name, aud she is also given
the sole custody of ber infant daughter,
Eulalia Savage, but the father may visit
the cbild occasionally.
In her bill of cmnplaint, filed a year
ago, Mrs Savage sets forth that ahe waa
married to the defendant on February
13, 1895, and that sbe obtained a decree
of divorce from him on March 13, 1897.
One year later. the plaintitf says, she
was remarried to Mr. Savage, the cere
mony taking place in Baltimore.
In ber bill ot complaint the wife
makes BMflflUoflBI1 charges againet ber
husband, and several pbotographs,
marked '-exhibits," in which Mr. Sav
age is pictured in tbe preaence of a
woman not hia wite, are filed among the
papers. Letter- c nisining terms ol en
dearraent, allege<! io have been written
lo Mr. Savage by a Balti ..ore womao,
are also filed aa evidence. Tbe Baltmore
woman is named as coreepoudf-nt.
