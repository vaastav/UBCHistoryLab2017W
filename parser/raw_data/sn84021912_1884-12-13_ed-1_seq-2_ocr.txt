General Porfirio Dias was
Inaugurated President of the

last Monday. He seems to be a
man of the people, of advanced
ideas, and will, no doubt, make
an acceptable Chief Executive.
TO BE COMTStsTED.
The grounds upon which the
seat of the Hon. Thos. Weedin
will be contested in the incoming
Legislature, is that at the time of
his election to the Council he was
a Clerk of the Board ofxSupervi
sorsof Pinal county. According
to a precedent by the Legislature,
at a previous session, in which a
similar case came up, it was de
cided that no person elected to
either branch of the Legislature
was a member thereof until he
took the oath of office. This
decision was in accordance with
all precedents in law governing
such cases. We understand that
Sir. Weedin has already resigned
his office as Clerk of the Board of
Supervisors of his county, and is
now free to take tne oath of a
Legislator without conflicting
with the established rules of the
country. Taking it for granted
that the grounds upon which Mr.
Weeden's seat will be contested
are correct, and he is, therefore,
disqualified to hold his seat, and
is ousted, it would not result in
any good to his county as it would
create a vacancy and necessitate
the expenses of another election.
Mr. Weedin was elected by quite
a large majority. He is the per
son whom his constituents wanted
to represent them in the Legis
lature (and it looks to us like a
piece of folly, coupled with un
kindness, to attempt to takeaway
his well-earned laurels upon the
flimsy pretence set forth by his
opponents. The theory, uuon
which Mr. Weedin's opponents
will base tbeir case is correct,
viz: That no person can hold two
offices within the gift of the
people, at the same time, but as
Mr. Weedin has resigned his
clerkship, no grounds remain for
his opponents, and their case will
probably go to the wall. We hope
the matter will be settled before
it comes to an issue and any con
siderable expense is incut red.
Look at This.
Every means of knowing Ari
zona's status in regard to her re
sources and wealth and population
indicate that this Territory is
rapidly assuming her station
among the most favored sections
of our great country, As an evi
dence that 'she is rapidly increas
ing in population we will cite the
simple fact, besides others that
were published a short time ago
in this paper, that in 1882 she
polled 10,054 votes. In two years
after, in 1884, at the recent elec
tion, she polled 12,491 votes, 2,437
more than she did iu 1882. Is not
this a splendid showing? We
give below the vote for Delegate
to Congress, Superintendent of
as proof of the above
figures: In the late election Col.
Bean's total vote in the territory
was 6,820. Col. Head polled 5,671;
Bean's majority, 1,149. Super
intendent of public isntruclion,
Long received 6,542 votes and
Jones 5,930; Long's majority,
612. For councilman-at-Iarge in
the southern district, Stevens re
ceived 3,376, Hughes 2,988;Stev
en's majority, 388. In the north
ern district, Ainsworth received
3,082; Cornwall, 3,018, Ainsworth's
majority, 64.
It is reported that there will he
an effort made at the next Legis
lature to form a new county out
of a portion of Cochise. As Co
chise county has a heavy bonded
debt hauglng over it, and as
times are dull, business slack, and
it people are burdened with
heavy taxation, we do not think
that it Is an opportune time to
devide up that county.
The Supreme Court of Califor
nia, a week ago last Monday,
rendered a decision in the cele
brated mining debris case, affirm
ing the decision of Judge Tem
ple; Judge) Temple's decision
was that miners could not dis
chargo debris into streams with
out making provisions for im
pounding it so that it might not
damage agricultural land.
It is doubtful if the Presidential
contest is settled yet. Mrs. Belva
Lockwood wants it understood
that she can kick as hard as the
gentleman from Maine. She says
"This thing is by no means oyer
yet, and I intend to make trouble
with the Board of Canvassers in
some of the States, who actually
threw out the votes cast for me."
Amony the votes thus thrown
out, she says, were 300 in Califor
nia."
The coal miners in Southern
Colorado, who have been out six
weeks, have extended their in
nuence to JNew Mexico ana se
rious trouble is now brewing,
which is likely to send out the
men engaged in all the most
important mines in the Territory,
The Atchison, fopeka and Santa
Railroad Company has suf
fered a gieat deal of annoyance
on account of the strike, and, be
ing unable to get a supply of coal
from the Colorado mines, made
an enorc to secure twenty car
loads daily from the Atlantic and
Pacific mines at Gallup, but in
this the company has now also
failed, the Colorado miners hav
ing notified the members of the
Union at Gallup, and they now
emphatically refuse to load an

The growth of Lbs Angeles
city and county during the past
four years has been almost un
paralleled. Recently published
statistics, supposed to be reliable,
show that In this brief period the
population of both the city and
the county has more than doubled
and the increase has i)een in
about the same proportion in
both. In 1880 the City of Los
Angeles had a population of 11,-
183; in 1881, 29.8G5. In 1880 Lo3
Angeles county had 33,379; in 1834
64,770. The total population of
both City and county is 94.635,
which in 1880, was 44,562. The
remarkable and feature of this
exhibit is in the fact that the new
population is of the most desira
ble character, made up almost ex
clusively of educated and refined
people, who have brought with
them sufficient means to puschase
homes and aid in the develop
raenc oi tne wonaermi resources
of that section ofnountry.
No doubt the British and
French Ministers at Washington,
D. C, have read the President's
Message with interest, for our
Government has succeeded in ne
gotiating a treaty with Nicara
gua which on the one hand ab-
ures the Clayton-Bulwer treaty,
and on the other is intended to
make the Panama Canal enter
prise a bad investment to the
French people. The treaty ne
gotiated, it is understood, in
cludes a concession made years
ago to General Grant, Admiral
Ammen, Morgan and others of a
right of way to build an inler
oceanic canal. Steps were taken
by the State Department long
before the concession was expec
ted to secure the privilege to the
United States. The department
did everything it could to prevent
the original company from suc
ceeding. The treaty now negotia
ted, of course awaits ratification
and the joint action of both
Houses of Congress, in making
the preliminary appropriation for
building the canal under the
auspices of the United States. It
said that President Arthur
counts this treaty as one of the
greatest achievements of his
administration. Unless the tem
per of the House, as. shown by
the debate at the close of the last
session on the mysterious Secret
Service Fund, has changed, there
is not much hope that this Con
gress will deal favorably with the
subject.
George W. Tyler, arf attorney of
San Francisco, California, acting
for John Wolcott, has brought
suit against W. W. Hollister, the
SantafcBarbara, California Million
aire, for the recovery of $100,000
damages. The complaint is based
on the following grounds.
'That on the day of , 1S75, at Santa
Barbara, in this State, and at divers
other days and times between that day
and the 1st day of August, 1884, and at
divers places iu said State, the said de
fendant, with force and arras, assaulted
and illtreated Josephine "Wolcott, then
and still being the wife of this plantiff at
all the times and places aforesaid, and
then and there debauohed and carnally
knew her, whereby tbis Dlaintiff from
thence hitherto haJh lost and been
deprived of the comfort, fellowship and
assistance of his said wife in his domestic
affairs. This plaintiff had no knowledgi
of the matters hereinbefore sat forth un
til or about August 15, 18S4."
Major Ruggles, the chief de
puty in the County Clerk's office,
in San Francisco, attempted to
conceal the document from the
press.
We havo the authority for sta
ting that New York sharpers have
beensending circulars to people

greenbacks for a small percentage
on the dollar, which could easily
be passed as genuine. Tho New
York police authorities have been
ad viced of the lactana tne swlnd

farious work.

The earnest recommendation
of Arthur in his message, to enact
necessary legislation to carry the
Mexican Reciprocity Treaty into
operation, will receive the im
mediate attention of the House.
Hewit said he would move that
the House proceed to the con
sideration of the revenue bills,
There Is but one anead of the
Mexican Treaty bill which may
provoke debate, the subject be
ing the repeal of the excise tax
on fruit brandy. That may be
put aside for the present and de
bate on treaty legislation begun.
At any event, Hewitt says he
will press his bill before the
House, and he is in favor of
omitting the usual speeches on
such measures. It is not probable,
however, that this can be done.
So that in any event the subject
of revenue reform will come up
incidentally in the discussion of
either of the first two revenue
bills on the culeudar.

Titty the sorrows of a poor old
man," etc., are the words that
have been flashed across the con
tinent as applying to Gen. Grant,
who is said to be impicunious.
President Arthur has recommen
ded to Congress that he be given
a life pension. This was brought
about from representations made
to him of the absolute necessities
of the General's condition. Bad
investments have exhausted the
fund raised by wealthy Now York
and Philadelphia gentlemen.
Since his son's failure the income
of the fund has been almost the
only means upon which he and
his family could depend. If it
should cease, there is nothing
before him but absolute poverty.
If these are facts as to the finan
cial condition of the ex-President,
Congress should proceed at once
to put him on the retired list with
ample pay for his future wants,
or until death,
