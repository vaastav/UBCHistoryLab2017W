JSUAL OPENING SCENES ENACTED

( ness on Hand. t
Washing' ton, Dec. 7. The final ses-
ion of the 54th congress convened at
oon to-day with the usual cere-
onies. "Hie visitors' galleries in both
e senate and the house were fairly
well occupied when the session opened,
and in the diplomatic srarlery a num-
ftber of foreign representatives sat
'waiting with much interest the read
ing of the president's message. On
several of the senators' desks were
oral pieces, and one particu-
arly elaborate piece rested on Vice-
'resident Stevenson's desk. Flowers
ere also plentifully in evidence in the
onse. " Before the session opened
here was the usual exchange of con
gratulations or condolences, as the
ase might be, over the results of the
lections.
Immigration Bill First in Order.
When the last session closed the
ouse Immigration bill had and now
as the rierht of way in the senate. It
Ms the unfinished business and will be
walled up pro forma at the expiration
f the morning hour. Although known
s the house bill on the calendar as re-
orted to the senate by Mr. Lodge, it
a materially different measure, all
f the house provisions having been
tricken out except the enacting clause
d a new bill substituted. This bill
ill be called up to-morrow by Sena-
;ors Lodge and Chandler, who desire
to push it to a vote as quickly as possi
ble. As the bill came from the house,
It provided not only for the exclusion
of immigrants who could not fill the
educational test, but went at some
Blerigth into the regulating of alien
cqfntract labor. Mr. Lodge's substi
tute provides for what is known as the
B d ucational test and excludes all per
ons over 14 years of age who cannot
ead and write the language of their
mother country or some other country,
( except that an aged person not so able
who is a, parent or grandparent of an.
pdmissable immigrant may accompany

jthe purpose of testing the eapaVbitity of,
ithe . immigrant to read and write a ci
Uition of five lines from the constitu
tion of the United States is to be used,
printed in the various languages of the
immigrants.
New Hates for Special Orders. '
An effort will be made to secure new
lates for the consideration of special
orders that were not reached during
the last session. These measures com
ing now under this preferred head are
penate bill 1012, to prevent the dese-
ration of the national flag; house bill
206, to amend the act to prevent the
extermination of fur-bearing animals
of Alaska; house bill 878, to reduce the
leases in which the penalty of death
in ay be inflicted, and senate joint reso
lution proposing an amendment to the
constitution providing for the election
f senators by popular vote. An im
portant local bill which has developed
la bitter fight is the Detroit bridge bill
Tor a bridge across the Detroit river.
It was postponed at the last session
until the first Monday in December. In
addition to the appropriation bills
there are several measures that will
contend with each other for the
right of way. Prominent among these
are the bills to refund the Pacific rail
road debt; to admit the territories of
New Mexico and Arizona; authorizing
the secretary of the navy to enlist ad
ditional men, now pending, in the sen
rite on a motion to reconsider the vote
by which it was passed; Mr. Davis'
resolution relative to the assertion and
enforcement of the Monroe doctrine;
as. bill to facilitate the construction of a
Gable between this country and the re
public of Hawaii; providing for a uni
jform classification and grading of agri
cultural products, and one providing
for the reorganization of the consular
(and diplomatic service.
Souse of Representatives.
I In the house of representatives the
swearing in of two new members was
jthe first to engage the attention of
'Sneaker read and the house Messrs.
bBoatner of Louisiana and Stokes of
(South Carolina. These gentlement en-
Hoy the very unusual distinction of
having twice received certificates of
Selection to one congress. At the last
Session their seats were declared va
cant, but the contestants did not sue
ceed in establishing their rights there-
'to, and new elections were ordered to
(fill the vacancies. Since congress ad
ionrned another vacancy has oc
curred that occasioned by the death
.of ex-Speaker Crisp. His son, who was
Ihis father's clerk, has been nominated
to fill the unexpired term, but the
election will not be held until the 16th
instant. Mr. Blue, chairman of the
bub-committee of the committee on ap
propriations, at a suitable opportunity,
(will report the general pension bill to
the bouse, .and announce a day for its
consideration
This will doubless be
.ft -lv Sr. 4-h.
The rules of the
K bouse provide that all business on the
calendar shall retain its place through
(' out an entire congress, so that adjourn
ij jqkent frona pne. session to another
means no more than adjournment
from day to day. The programme of
business for the first week of the ses
sion will depend upon the develop
ments from daylo day, of committee
action and recommendation. Before
the week closes, however, the legisla
tive, executive and judical appropria
tion bill will be renorted and nlaced on"

the calendar, and on Friday nightJ
there will be the usual session for the '
consideration of private pension bills.
- Ihe Mesagr.
The president submitted his message,
a synopsis of which is given below:
To the Congress of the United States:
As representative of 1 the people in
the legislative branch of their govern
ment, you have assembled at a time
when the strength and excellence of
our free institutions and the fitness of
our citizens to enjoy popular rule have
been again made manifest. A political
contest involving momentous conse
quences, frought wi't'h feverish appre
hension and creating that aggressive
ness so intense as approached bitter
ness and passion, has been waged
throughout our land, and determined
by the decree of a free and independ
ent suffrage, without disturbance of
our tranquility or the leas'c sign of
weakness in our national structure.
The message says that while none of
our citizens in Turkey have thus far
been killed or wounded their safety
in the future is by no means assured.
Our government at home and our min
ister at Constantinople have left noth
ing undone to protect our missionaries
in Ottoman territory, who compose
nearly all the individuals residing
there, who have the right to claim our
protection on the score of American
citizenship. The message says that
our efforts in this direction will not be
discontinued. The president says that
sufficient naval vessels have been sta
tioned there to secure the protection
of American interests. On the Cuban
question the president says that the
insurrection still continues with all
perplexities. He says that it is diffi
cult to perceive tha't any progress has
thus far been made towards the pacifi
cation of the island, or that the situa
tion of affairs as depicted, in his last
annual message has in the least im
proved. "If Spain still holds Havana
and the seaports and all the consider
able towns, the insurgents still roam
at will over at least two thirds o'f the
inland country. If the determination
of Spain to put down the insurrection
seems but to strengthen with the lapse
of time, there is much reason to believe
that the insurgents have gained in
point of numbers and character and re
sources, and are none the less inflexible
in their resolve not to succomb without
practically securing the great cJbjec't
for which they took up arms. If Spain
has not yet re-established her author
ity neither have the insurgents made
arood their title to be regarded as an
independent state. Indeed, as the con
test has gone on, the pretense that civil
government exists on the island, except
as far as Spain is.a.bleto -rnaintain..-it
has been practically abandoned." .:The
message mentions the bands of mau-
rauders who are to be found on 'the
island, now fighting for one party and
'low for the other, as may best suit the
'occasion. While it was evidently the
riginal intention of Spain to prevent
.his, "it now seems as though they had
xdopted the same means of warfare
.low, deeming it true that the grea'ter
lestruction -c'f property is advisable
:o prevent their enemy to secure the
id vantage from it. The president says
:hat 'the spectacle o'f the utter ruin of
in adjoining country, by nature one of
he most fertile end most charming on
:he globe, would engage the serious at
tention of the government and people
if the United Sta'tes in any circum
stances. He says that our actual pecu-
- liary interest in it is second only to
hat of the people and government of
pain. It Is reasonably estimated that
it least from $30,000,000 to $50,000,000
.re invested on the island. He says
hat it was at first proposed that bel
igerent rights should be accorded to
che insurgents. A proposition no lon
ger urged because untimely and in
ractical operation clearly perilous
md injurious to our own interests.
The president reiterates the historic
llsposition of the United States not to
icquire colonial possessions, and says
that Spain should "come under this
lead in each and every sense. The
.hief executive devotes a large part of
lis message to the Cuban question, but
loes not commit the United States to
an aggressive policy in regard to
bringing to an abrupt conclusion the
war now in progress on the island.
He says that when the ability of Spain
to deal successfully has has been so
manifested and it is demonstrated that
her sovereignty is evidence In Cuba
for all purposes o'f its rightful exist
ence, and when a hopeless struggle for
its re-e-stablishment has degenerated
into a strife which means nothing
more than the useless sacrifice of hu
man life, and the utter destruction of
the very subject matter of the conflict,
a situation will be presented in which
our obligations to the sovereignty of
Spain will be supersedeoyyby .either ob
ligations, which we cah"hairdly hesi
tate to recognize and discharge.
The Venezuelan boundary- question
has ceased to be a matter of difference
between Great Britain and the United
States, their respective' ' governments
having agreed upon "the substantial
provisions of a treaty " between Great
Britain and Venezuela, submitting the
whole controversy to arbitration. The
provisions of the treaty are so emi
nently just and fair, that the assent of
Venezuela thereto may be conlfidently
anticipated.
Negotiations for a general treaty of
all differences between Great Britain
and the United States are advanced
and promise to reach a successful con
snmmfliinn at an. earlv date.:
The president says that the position
of the United Sta'tes In regard to mat
ters concerning the Behring sea has
improved within the past year.
The secretary of the treasury reports
that during-the yeajr ended June 30,
1S96, the receipts of 'the government
from all sources amounted to $409,475,-
408.78. During the same nenod the ex
penditures were $434,678,654.48; the ex
cess of expenditures over receipts thus
amounting to $25,203,245.70.
In testimony whereof I have hereto
set my hand and caused to be affixed
the seal of the United States.
Signed, - '
GROVER CLEVELAND, ,
President of United States.
Venezuela Accepts.
Venezuela has accepted the arbitra
tion as agreed upon by Secretary Olney
and Sir Julian Pauncefort. A special
meeting of the Venezuelan - congress
will be called in a few days.
WILL NOT ACCEPT IT
Bayard Declines the Proposed
Present from Englisnmen.
MANY THANKS FOR THE PROMOTERS
Deeply Touched and Gratified at the Kind
Evidence of Esteem, But Vnsble in
11 is Present Position To
Accept the Gift.
Washington, Dec. 7. Information
has been received here that Ambassa
dor Bayard has declined with many
thanks the proposed testimonial which
the London Daily Telegraph suggest
ed should be raised by popular sub
scription in England as a mark of
appreciation-of his efforts to preserve
good will between the two countries.
Mr. Bayard takes the ground that
his position as ambassador would pre
vent his acceptance of any gift of the
kind proposed. This is in accord with
the views which the state department
held of Mr. Bayard's action in the
matter. ' The letter sent by the am
bassador to the Telegraph declining
the proposed honor is dated December
5, and says in part: "Early this morn
ing I telegraphed you not to proceed
further with your kind and generous
proposal for a testimonial to me from
the people of this country in token of
their appreciation of my efforts to es
tablish between the two great English
speaking countries relations of har
mony and good will." Mr. Bayard
then proceeds to say that he was
touched and gratified by the proposal
and the Telegraph's generpus eulogy
of him, but that a few hours' reflection
showed him that, holding his present
office and invested with its discretion
and duties, he should scrupulously obey
the spirit of his country's, law, which
inhibit anyone nolding an office of
trust or .. profit under the American
government from accepting "without
the consent of congress any present
from any king, prince or government."
He further says: "While I live I shall
not cease to thank the people of these
islands for the whole-hearted, un
stinted welcome I have received at
their hands and the warm hospitalities
that have been showered on me and
mine."
The Proposal Withdrawn.
London, Dec. 7. The Telegraph, In
a leader, to-day announces the with
.ira.wal of its proposal- for a public
fund for a present , to Ambassador
13ayard. It says there is no need to
inquire whether any high official au
thority influenced Mr. Bayard to de
cline the proposed gift. The reception
iti the proposal has shown how sincere
is the good will of the English nation
upwards him.
PLAGUE-STRICKEN CUBA.
Over 10,000 Spanish Soldiers in Hospitals
in Havana and Immediate Suburbs.
Washington, Dec. 7. Dr. M. Bur
gess, sanitary inspector of the marine
aospital service at Havana, informs
Surgeon-General Wyman under date of
Sov. 28 that yellow fever in Cuba had
not diminished particularly in severity
luring the previous week; that small
pox increased considerably among
civilians, and that fevers and dysen
tery had augmented considerably. Of
the 416 deaths in the week ended Nov.
26, 87 were from yellow fever and 220
new cases were reported; 54 from small
pox, with 400 new cases. Eighty -three
of the 87 deaths from yellow fever
during the week were among Spanish
soldiers in the military hospitals, the
remaining four being among civilians.
All of the 54 deaths from small pox
occurred among civilians. "I am in
formed," said Dr. Burgess, "from what
I believe to be credible sources, that in
the eight government military hospitals
which are established in the city and
its immediate suburbs there are over
10,000 sick and wounded Spanish sol
diers. "
Ivory's Trial Postponed.
London, Dec. 7. The solicitors of
Edward J. Ivory, alias Edward Bell,
the alleged Irish-American dynamite
conspirator, have obtained a postpone
ment of his trial for one month in order
to enable them to complete their chain
of evidence on behalf of the prisoner
by the arrival of witnesses, depositions,
etc., from New York. ,
Canada Against Immoral Hiiteratni-e.
Ottawa, Dec. 7. The Dominion gov
ernment has prohibited the entry into
Canada of the Figaro aud certain other
French -journals, the "National Council
of Women, headed by Lady Aberdeen,
having exerted their influence to have
all immoral literature and. pictures
kept out of the country.
Insane from Excessive Smoking. .
Ligonier, Ind., Dec. 7. C. F. Mosier,
a former representative in the state
legislature from Elkhart county and a
prominent republican politician, has
been pronounced insane, his malady
being attributed, to excessive smoking
and too close attention to business.
Republican Senators To Caucus. '
Washington, Dec. 7. The republi
cans of the senate will hold a caucus
to-morrow morning. It is not expected
that the first caucus will reach any
conclusions on pending questions. The
general situation will be discussed, bat

THE CUBAN INSURRECTION.
Weyler's Latest Decree Stories of Enor
mous Thieving Among: Army Officials,
i -Havana, Dec. 7. The real reason
for the new decree which will soon be
issued by Captain-General Weyler, re
quiring every able-bodied man between
the ages of 18 to 60 to take the field
against the isur(V2nts, is perfectly well
known here, although no one dares to
openly discuss it. It is a fact that the
18.000 soldiers recently sent here by
Spain are not enough to cover the
losses of the Spanish army within the
past few weeks. More than that, it is
said that high military authorities
here are concealing from Spain the
knowledge of more than half of the
army's losses for the purpose of con
tinuing to draw from the treasury the
wages and allowances of the dead
men. It is estimated that from April,
1895, to last November more than $30.
000,000 have been stolen from the
Spanish treasury in this way. The
number of soldiers in the field is less
than 'the central government believes,
and is not sufficient for Weyler's plan
of campaign, which is simply to march
against the insurgents in heavy bodies.
The news of the forthcoming decree
has created such an excitement among
Cuban families that the number of
young men who have joined the in
surgent forces within the past few
days is greater than at any time since
the beginning of the war. A circular
has been quietly issued to the Cubans,
which says: "No man of honor can
doubt which side he must take if
placed by the tyranny of the Spanish
government in the position of choosing
between Spain and Cuba Libre."
Talk of war with the United States is
again heard. What makes the Span
ish residents more desperate is the
financial distress of the country, which
is ruining them. They all believe that
a war with the United States would
afford a happy solution. In their ig
norance of the real power of the
United States, they imagine that Spain
would win, and that after Uncle Sam
was beaten he would have to pay a
heavy indemnity to Spain. Outside
of Havana famine is beginning to
spread. In Bramates, province of
Pin ar del Kio, 10,000 persons are dying
from Hunger. In Cardenas poverty is
so great that families who were
wealthy before the war are now beg
ging in the streets. In Cienfuegos, an
ODulent city until 1895, the misery is
also great, and-here in Havana famine
is expected soon as a consequence of
Weyler's methods of warfare End his
destruction of all the provisions in the
country districts.
WEYLER'S CAMPAiGN.
The Whereabouts of the Spanish General
Still a Blatter of Doubt.
Havana, Dec. 7. Four days nave
now elapsed since any news has been
received from Captain General Weyler.
It is not known in what part of the
province of Pinar del Kio he is or what
he is doing towards carrying out the
plan of the campaign on which the loy
alists have built high hopes, but which
has thus far resulted in no signal suc
cess. Heavy rains have been prevail
ing lately and it is probable that the
condition of the country has put a tem
porary cheek on the operations of the
Spanish forces. Officials here state
that there is nothing surprising in no
dispatches being received from General
Weyier, as he is a man of action rather
than of words, and is waiting to meet
the rebels before he devotes any time
to writing dispatches. General Mel
guizo reports that his command snr
prised a rebel hospital in the Valle
hills, province of Pinar del Rio. Six
insurgents, whether wounded or not is
not stated, were killed and the dwell
ings and all the camp paraphernalia
were destroyed. The first contingent
of the new reinforcements, numbering
2,500 men, arrived here yesterday.
Death of Rev. A. T. AVorden.
Canajoharie, N. Y., Dec. 7. The
Eev. A. T. Worden, aged 55 years, died
suddenly of heart failure yesterday at
his home in Ames, N. Y., where he
had been pastor of the Free Baptist
church for twelve years. He resigned
a year ago on account of failing
health. Mr. Worden served through
the civil war, having enlisted as a pri
vate, and was promoted several times.
After the war he studied for the minis
try and was ordained in 1871 He was
well known in literary circles through
his contributions of poetry, humorous
sketches, etc., to prominent periodicals.
Naval Apprentice loys Return.
Newport, R. I.,- Dec 7. All of the
apprentice boys who escaped from the
naval training station Saturday after
noon had been brought back or had re
turned of their own free will by mid
night, and all are confined in the
brig. The whole affair was apparent
ly a boyish escapade to show disap
proval of the way things' have been
managed in regard to liberty-granting:

TWO IMPORT NT DECISIONS.
T. H. Hayes Wins His Suit With the
American Insurance Co.
Judge Bradstreet rendered two very
important decisions in tha Matr-i
court today.
Thomas H. IIav ft
can Insurance Co of Newark, N. J.
Judgment was rendered for plaintiff
lo recover f ,zuu and costs. The story
of the case is as follows:
P. H. Seery kept a saloon at 35 East
Main street and he insured the place,
which was fitted up in an elaborate
manner, in five different companies.
In the present company the place was
insured .for $1,250 and the stock for
?250. December 28, 1894, the building
was destroyed by fire at a loss to the
saloon of $12,000. February 23, 1895.
P. II. Seery made an assignment and
Thomas H. Hayes was appointed
trustee. The companies failing to
make good the loss by fire, suit was
brought by the trustee against each
of the companies. The suit against
the American Insurance Co was made
a test case and was tried a few months
ago. The amout claimed- from this
company was $1,800. Webster ajid
Seery for the plaintiff, Terry and
Bronson for the defendants. The
whole amount involved is some $8,000.
Patrick Thomnsnn vs Tnhn Hanna
judgment for plaintiff to recover $300
ana costs, a contract was entered in
to between both parties that the de
fendant was to furnish stone for use
on the new almshouse, freightage paid
and the plaintiff was to pay for the
same, $1,800, when delivered. The
plaintiff alleges that he had paid
freightage on the stone to the amount
of $256.37 and sued for that ataount
and damages. Lowe for plaintiff,
Webster and O'Neill for defendants.
HE CAPTURED THE DEER.
School Clerk Moran Now Exhibits the
Antlers of the Animal.
When School Clerk Thomas J. Mo
ran was at the Adirondacks last sum
mer, he had an encounter with a deer
which came near resulting in a victory
for his antagonist. Mr Moran was out
gunning when one of those fleet footed
animals hove in sight and the hunts
man took aim and fired at it. The ball
struck the deer in the side wounding
it fatally, but still leaving it possesse'"
of sufficient animation to make a good
run and off it started with Mr Moran
in hot pursuit. The animal was grow
ing weaker at everystep and its pur
suer was about to catch hold of it by
one of its hind legs, when it fell from
exhaustion and Mr Moran was thrown
onto the body of his victim with con
siderable force." .His arms were
wedded firmly between its antlers and
had it net been for the assistance of a
farmer who happened along and help
ed to extricat him, Mr Moran thinks
he would 'have been dead before he
would recover the strength necessary
to free himself from his peculiar po
sition. He says his feet were held
fast in a clump of brush and his hands
were as useless as if they were in the
grip of a vise. Mr Moran gave the
carcass of the animal to the man who
found him in the woods and the head
he sent to New York to have mounted.
It reached here to-day and is one of
the neatest stag heads in the city. The
eyes are lifelike and the pearly teeth
and gold tips on the antlers, render it
a desirable piece of furnishing for any
home. Mr Moran feels jubilant over
the receipt of the prize and says he
was afraid, seeing it had been delayed
so long, that the house had made some
mistake and had forwarded it to some
one else.

one. There is no ticket for mayor or
other higher city officers, only the
councilmen and aldermen being elec
ted. It is one of the least contested

party work being done by either side.
In the first ward the democrats have

TAKEN TO THE ALMS HOUSE.
A Woman Who Was Living Alone and
Without Food.
In the early part of last week Ed
ward Campion, who lived at 466 Dub
lin street, was noticed out by his land
lord for non payment of rent. The old '
man was advised to take up his quar
ters at the almshouse. He had grown
too old for hard labor and the select
men finally persuaded him to go to the
almshouse. Old Mrs Cuddy kept
house for Campion and she positively
refused to leave the house. Friends
and neighbors tried to advise, but she
would not go to the almshouse. The
officer who had the ejectment" papers
took pity on her and allowed her a
few davs grace, to see if she would
not yield. This morning some of the
neighbors not seeing any signs of life
around the house, entered, and a
cheerless aspect was disclosed. Mrs
Cuddy was there, half frozen, having
had no fire since Saturday night. The
kind hearted neighbors at once pro
ceeded to brighten up things and then
sent word to the selectmen. Steps
were taken at once to remove the
woman. Many of the neighbors be
lieve she is a little deranged and if this
is so, unless she goes quietly,- papers
will have to be issued to commit her .
to the almshouse.
Special Officer Laughlin went to the
house this afternoon and by his genial
smile and persuasive eloquence in
duced the woman to enter a hack and
she was taken to the almshouse. Not
a particle of furniture was in the
dwelling where she was found, nor any
eatables outside of a few potatoes.
How she got into the house is a mys
tery, as the officer locked it up whet
he removed Campion. The woman is
said to have very rich relations in
Ireland who will be communicater1
with.

And Drove From Cheshire to Water
bury Before Discovering the Error.
If Edward O'Hara,- a caster at the
Scoville : Manufacturing Co, does not
lose his temper and shoot some one be
fore Saturday night, he must be pos
sessed of more patience than comes
to ordinary mortals. A slight mistaike
which occurred yesterday is respon

Mr O'Hara called at James Long-J

the fiery steed was hitched and Mr
O'Hara and his fair companion - went
into the hotel, remaining there until
about 7:30 o'clock. Nearly everybody
who goes to Cheshire makes a call at
Mr Scott's and on this, account there
are always several teams hitched about?
the hotel. When Mr O'Hara was
about to make the return trip he went
over to the shed and backed out one of
the teams, believing it to be his own
of course and soon 'the couple were
heading for Waterbury. Everything
went along all right until they reached'
the corner of East Main and Cole
streets, where the driver had quite a
hard time to keep the horse from
going' into the center. He was coaxed
into obedience, however and after leavr
ing his fair occupant at her own door
Mr O'Hara drove to the stable and
that's when the fun started. He had
the wrong horse and could give no ex
planation why, except that there were
several other teams at -Cheshire and
it was possible that he unhitched some
one else's rig. After a hunt around tho
different stables it was found that the
team O'Hara brought home belonged, to
Austin & Sackett and at the same time
that the mistake was discovered a,
drummer was driving Into the Scovill
house stables with Long-worth's team.;
The joke spread like wildfire and was
the talk of the town all day.
BRYAN'S BOOK.
Its Title Will Be "The First Battle
His Reasons for Writing It.
Lincoln, Neb., Dec. 7. It has just
been learned that the title of William'
J. Bryan's book is to be the "The First
Battle." In the preface, he states his
reasons . for writing the book in the ,
following words: "The campaign of .
1896 was a remarkable one, whether
we measure it by the magnitude of the '
issues involved or by the depth of in
terest aroused. I have been led to un
dertake the present work by a desire
felt by myself and expressed by others
to have the more important incidents ,
of the campaign put into permanent
form for the convenience of those who
have taken part in the contest and for '
the use of those who shall hereafter
desire to review the struggle. The
amount of work done by the advocates;
of free coinage is beyond computation
and the number of those who took an
active part in the contest too great for
enumeration. These . facts, tog-ether
with the" difficulty of choosin; between
bo many meritorious speeches, have '"
compelled me to limit the quotations
to the addresses made and papers is
sued by persons standing in an official
or semi-official capacity and to the.
principal speeches delivered by myself.
I have added a brief history of the
campaign, including a decision of .the ,
election returns and the significance
thereof. It has also boen thought
best to narrate the part taken by me
In the silver agitation prior to the con
vention, and at the request of the pub-
lishers I have included a biographical
sketch, written by Mrs. Bryan."
