WAairrasTOX. Dec 6. President Mo-
' Kioley sent bis annual message to con
press. "-' He congratulated It upon assembling ander
- uStlou3 conditions. Peace and good will with
' lunations of the earth continue unbroken, he
TrL. and we should feel genuine satisfaction at
ihe crowing spirit of fraternal regard and uni-
- fleaUon in all sections of our country and tbe
lifting 61 great public questions above party
prejudice.
Th Finance.
- Beginning with the subject of the finances,
-- the president says tat while the full effect of
th legislation of the extra session has not yet
: ttetn realised., what it has already accomplished
assure V of its timeliness and wisdom. To
IMt its permanent value further ttme will ' be
setfatvea and the people, satisfied with Its oper-
- at ana and results thus far, are In no mind to
'withhold from It a fair trial. The next ques
: (ion pressing for consideration is that of tho
enrreacy. wits the great resources of govern
meat and with the honorable example of the
past before us. we ought not to hesi"
Sst to enter upon a currency
revision which will make our demand obliga-
- ' tioBS less onerous to the gorortment, and re
vive our financial laws from . ambiguity and
(kmht. The evil of the present system is
' found In the great cost to the government of
jnaiataining at a parity with gold our different
- forms of money, and the experience of the past
' jour years have demonstrated that this is not
- only an expensive charge upon the government,
but a dangerous menaco to the national
- redit. It is manifest that we must devise
" some plan to protect the government against
bond issues for repeated redemptions. We
have CMX),Ma,0Q0 of currency, vhicn the gov
erament, by solemn enactment, hjs undertaken
to keep at par, and nobody is obliged to redeem
iagoM but the government, which must borrow
t the gold. The law, which requires the payment
eat of the treasury of redeemed United states
notes, demands a constant replenishment of the
cold reserve, especially In times ef panie and
Insufficient revenue, and during the preceding
administration (262,313,400 4H-per-cenU bonds
were issued and sold to sustain
the gold reserve and pay the expenses
of the government in excess of revenue. Vniie
It is true that a greater part of this Is used to
supply deficient revenues, a considerable por
" tion was required to maintain the gold reserve.
If no further legislation is to be had. to correct
this and the policy ct selling bonds Is to be
continued, then congress should give the sec
retary of the treasury authority to sell bonds
at long or sfrort periods, bearing a less rate of
- interest tan is now authorized by law. The
president says:
Recommendations.
" I earnestly recommend as soon as the receipts
Of the government are quite sufficient to pay all
the expenses of the government, that when any
United States notes are presented for redemp
tion In gold and t-a redeemed in gold, suota
notes shall be kept and set apart and only paid
cut in axctiange far gold. This is an
obvious duty. If the holder of the
. United States note prefers the gold
'. and gets it from tho government
... ae should not receive back from t.9 govern
ment a United States note without paying gold
In exchange for it,"
That amounts, to the president's mind, to giv
ing an interest bearing debt, a government
. Dona, for a non-interest bearing debt, a United
. States note. The government should be re
lieved from the burden of providing all the
avid required for exchanges and exports. This
ought to be stopped. With an era of prosperity
- and sufficient receipts we may feel no immediate
embarrassment, but the danger will be ever
present.
- The president 'nvltes careful consideration
for the detail plan of the secretary of the treas
ury to protect the gold reserve. He concurs
- with him in the recommendation that national
banks be allowed to issue notes to the face
value of their bonds deposi ted; that their cir-
- eolation tax be, reduced to one-half of one per
cent, and national banks may be established
with a capital of rS.uui), He also recommends
that the is.u of national bank notes be re
stricted to the denomination of ten dollars and
upwards and that they be required to redeem
. Uteir p.otes in gold.
, Tho Cuban Question.
' Turning to foreign affairs, the president de-
. 7 votes muoh space in his message to a consider-
atioa of the Cuoan question, which he says, is
. the most important problem with which our
- government is now called upon to deal in its
. foreign relations. Summarizing the history of
former outbreaks, the president comes down to
. the present insurrection, speaking of its re
. markable increase, its tenacious existence
against enormous forces massed by Spain, the
widespread destruction of property and the
disregard or the civilized loUo of
war on both sides. He says these conditions
give rise to gravest a pprehensions. There is
ao desire on our part to profit by Spain's mis
fortunes, and we have only the desire to see
Cubans enjoying that measure of self-control,
which is the inalienable ritfht of man. Of the
concentration policy of Weyler he says: "It
' has utterly (ailed as a war measure. It is not
o.viiixe'i warfare it is extermination."
Oar Government's I'rotest.
: Against this abuse of the rights of war, the
president says, he has felt constrained, on re
peated occasions, to enter the firm and honest
protest of this government. He outlines his
instructions to Minister Woodford, which were
in substance to impress upon the Spanish gov-
, eroment the sincere wish of the United States
U lend its aid toward the ending of the war by
reaching a peaceful and lasting result, just and
; honorable to Spam and to the Cuban people.
. It was also asked whether Spain of her own
volition should not make proposals for settle
ment and it was said that we could not contem-
. piate an indefinite period for the accomplish
ment of this result.
The Spanish Reply.
The Spanish leply to Mr. Woodford, was. In
the president's opinion, in the direction of a
better understanding. It admitted our friendly
purposes and deep interest, and declared that
. the new government was bound to change of
policy that should satisfy the United States and
pacify Cuba within a reasonable time. To this
end political reforms will be put into effect ana
military operations conducted on humane
lines. It was suggested that Spain be
left free to conduct military operations
and grant political reforms while the
United States for its part should enforce neu
tral obligations and cut -off the assistance
which the insurgents, it was asserted, received
from this country. Early and complete pacifi-
cation is hoped for.
The president declares that the Spanish dis
. position to charge us with failure to meet in
ternational duties is baseless, and points to
the efforts this government have made at the
cost of millions, and by the employment of the
administrative machinery of the nation to per
form its duty welL He also says that the fact
that no military expedition or armed vessel
has left our shores has been diplomatically
. represented with Spain. Promising that
throughout all the horror and danger to our
. Peace, the United States has never abrogated
. its right to determine its policy as to Cuba, the
: president points out that, of untried measures,
, . there remains only: Recognition of the insur
;. gents as belligerents, recognition of the inde
pendence of Cuba, neutral intervention to end
- he war by imposing a rational compromise be-
- tween the contestants, an intervention in faor
of one or the other party.
Mo Forcible Annexation.
Bessys: T speak not of forcible annexa
tion, for that can not be thought of. That by
our code of morality would bo criminal aggres
ion. Taking up the question of belligerency,
the president quotes at length from President
. Grant's message of December 7, 1875. wherein
: ,. he declared that the condition in Cuba war
ranted neither the recognition of independence
nor the recognition of belligerency. He adds
. tt moreover a recognition of bellig
erency-,, .would confer upon neither
, psrty to conflict a status not theretofore act
, Bally possessed, while it would weigh heav ily
la Spain's behalf, giving her the right to search
on the hl.-h seas and extending her maritime
- Jfsts to the margin of our territorial waters.
or these reasons," says the president, "I
. Jgsrd the recognition of the belligerency of
... jae Cuban insurgents as now unwise and there
fore inadmissible. Should that step hereafter
M deemed wise, as a matter of right and duty.

The president pax takes up thesubjoct or
the aiexatfcn ttlHawaii which, he says, should

arguments in favor of annexation, be says thai
legislation is required in the event of the ratifi
cation of the treaty and. while abrupt assimilsx

be avoided. Just provision should be made tot
self-rule in local matters with tha largest na
litical liberty to the Hawaiian.
He says that the dispute between Japan and
Hawaii over the -immigration question is now
in a satisfactory stage of settlement by negOtias
tions; that our government has not intervened,
and that it Is learned that Japan is now eoi
fident in the Intention of this government to
deal with all possible ulterior questions affect
ing her interests in the broadest soirit of
friendliness. -
Central American Complexities.
Reference is made to the failure of Mr. Mar
ry to be received as minister to 1 ic&fagna on
account of the obligations ef that country to
the diet of the OreiLer Republic of Central
Amei ica. As there in no legal authority at
present td accredit him to the diet, Mr. Baker,
ttfe present minister at Managua, has been di
rected to present his letters of recall. Mr. W.
Godfrey Hunter is said to be likewise accred
ited to Honduras, a member of the Greater Re
public, and his case is awaiting actionv
The 2nearagiia Canal.
Tho Nicaragua canal is spoken of as of largo
importance to our country, and the promise is
made of further reference to the subject which,
111 the report of the commission now at work,
is sent to congress.
International Bl-Bf etalllsm.
The president says of the International mon
etary commission that, notwithstanding dil
igent effort, the envoys have failed
so far to secure un agreement. Gratifica
tion is expressed at the action of France
in this matter in joining in our effects, and it is
said that the negotiations are still pending
Meanwhile the envoys have not made their
final reports, believing that the doubts raised in
certain quarters respecting tha feasibility of
maintaining parity between gold and silver may
yet be solved. The president earnestly hopes
that their labors may bring about an interna
tional agreement.
Reciprocity Negotiations.
Mr. Kasson, of Iowa, is said to be now con
ducting negotiations with several governments
for reciprocity arrangements under the tariff
act, and it is believed that by a careful exercise
of the powers conferred by the act, some griev
ances of our own and other countries in our
mutual trade relations may be removed or alle
viated and the Volume of our commercial ex
changes enlarged.
The president earnestly urges the improve
ment of our merchant marine, the inferiority of
which, he says, is humiliating to the national
aside.
Protection of Seat Life
Reference is made to the recent conferences
at Washington on the subject of the protection
of seal life, the results of which place beyond
controversy, it is said, of the duty of the gov
ernments concerned to adopt measures Without
delay for the preservation of the herds. Nego
tiations to this end are now in progress
International Arbitration.
International arbitration is declared by the
president to represent the best sentiment of the
civilized world, and treaties embodying these
humane principles on broad lines, without in
any way imperilling our interests orSwor, will
have its constant encouragement.
The Paris Expoaltlon.
A liberal appropriation is bespoken in order
that the United States may make a creditable
exhibit at the approaching Paris exposition, in
which the people have shown an unprecedented
interest
The Navy.
Under the head of the navy, tho president
points to the necessity for speedy legislation
to procure the armor for the three battleships
"now building, which would be otherwise use
less. He speuks in terms of praise of the qual
ity of our ships, and thinks that the time has
now arrived when 'the increase to which the
country is committed should for a time take
the form of increased facilities commensurate
with the increase of our naval vessels
Lack of JUock Facilities.
He refers to the lack of docks, and urges that
three or four of the largest docks be provided
on the Atlantic, et least one on the Pacific
coast, and a floating dock in the gulf. There
should also be ample provision for munitions
of war and an increase of officers and enlisted
men. Additions are also necessary to navy
yards, and as there are now on the stocks five
large battleships it is recommended that an
appropriation be made but for one more battle
ship on the Pacitio coast Several torpedo
boats are also necessary.
Legislation Needed for Alaska.
Attention is called to the need for prompt
legislation as to Alaska and the extension of
civil authority within the territory. There is
need for surveys and for the establishment of
another land officu at some point in the Yukon
valley, for which an appropriation is asked,
Military force is also necessary and the estab
lishment of some sort of flexible government.
If the startling reports as to the probable
shortage of food for the miners be fully veri
fied, every effort should be made at any cost to
carry them relief.
Affairs In the Indian Territory.
The message deals at some length with the
unsatisfactory condition of affairs in the Indian
territory. The lare white element is said to be
without protection and without schools or oth
er rights of citizens; leading Indians have ab
sorbed great tracts of lands and created an
aristocracy, and the friends of the Indians be
lieve that the best interests of the five cU-iiized
tribes would be found in American citizenship.
Failure of the Uanres Commission.
Reference is made to the failure so far of tho
Dawes commission to secure the consent of tho
tribes to an extinguishment of tho tribal title
and a division of the lands. It is said tha?
should the tribes still fail to ratify the agree
ment, that some legislation should be had by
congress.
s The Quarantine Lawn.
The president approves the recommendation
of the secretary of ih j treasury for an exten
sion of the quarantine laws, and also suggests
the appointment of a special commission to as
certain the cau e of yellow fever.
The Kansas Pacific Railroad.
Speaking of the pending sale of the Kansas
Pacific railroad, it is said, that if no better
bidder is received than the upset price fixe! by
the court, the government would receive only
2,500,OOJ on its claim of nearly tl3,0 0.00.1. He
believes that the government has the authority
to bid on the roa.l, and has directed the secre
tary of tho treasury to make the deposit of
fyou,0(Ki required to qualify as a bidder, and to
bid at the sale a sum t least equal to the prin
cipal of the debt to tha government.
Congress Should LejjiitlHle In the Caao.
He suggests, however, that in a matter so im
portant as the government becoming a possible
owner of the railroad, congress should enaot
some legislation to define its views. It is clear
to him. however, that the government should
not permit the property to be soid at a price
less than one half the principal of its debt and
less than one-fifth of its entire debt, principal
and interest.
The Civil Service.
The president devotes the last chapter of his
message to he civil service, the practical im
provement of which, he says, has long been a
subject of earnest discussion, and which has of
la'.e year3 received increa-ied legislative and ex
ecutive approval. During the past few months
the service has been placed upon a still
firmer basis of business methods
and personal merit. While the
right of deserving veteran soldiers
to reinstatement has been asserted, dismissals
for merely political reasons have been carefully
guarded against; the examinations improved
and made practical, and a distinct advance
has been made by living a hearing beforo dis
missal upon all cases where incompetency is
charged or demand made for the removal of
officials. This last has been done with
out impairing tho power of re
moval, one of the vital safeguards
of the system. Much remains to be done be
fore the system can be perfected, and the pres
ident says that he shall not hesitate to exempt
cases which he thinks have been improperly
included in the classified service, or include
those which, in his judgment, will best promote
the public service. The system has the ap
proval of the people, and it will be hi endeavor
to uphold and extend it.
Ketreuchment Suggested.
In conclusion, the president admonishes con
gress not to encourage the increase of the esti
mates for the maintenance of the government.
They would admitof decrease in many branches
and it is a commanding duty to keep the aopro
priatlons within the receipts of the gOTern
mentl and thus avoid a deficit.
An Eplaod.
"No John!"
The words were spoken gentljr, yet
firmly. Had I been older and more ex
perienced in the ways of the gentler
sex I might Tiave' known that the an
swer was final.
But I was young very, very young
and I was vain enough to think that
she would be unable to resist my plead
ing. X entreated her to take back those
cruel words; but she would not listen.
I begged I implored, but she was in
exorable. Yet she was kind. She mere
ly told me that nothing I could say
would move her. It was for my own
g-jod, she said, and some day I would
thank her for it.
Her calm, cool manner angered me,
and, forgetting the deference due the
fair sex, I threatened violence.
She looked at me reprovingly and
shook her head. She did not fear me
in the least. Torture beyond endurance
by grief and anger, I burst into un
manly tears.
. At last she was aroused. Drawing
herself up to ber full height, she said,
in angry tones: No, John Eenry, you
can't have another piece of pie, and if

DUN'S COMMEKCIAL REVIEW.
.The Opening of Congress Did Not Disturb
Basinets Speculative Markets Stronger,

ductive Industries la tho Usually Dull,
eat Season of the Year mm to Near Or
ders Fallnrest
NMW Vtwut, DjA iU ft. (J. Dan &
Co.a weekly review jf trade says in its
Issue of to-day: ."
. The Opening of . congress, with the
annual message and reports, has not
disturbed business, as some predicted,
but all speculative markets are stronger
than a week ago. The productive in
dustries, even in the season usually
about the dullest of the year as to new
orders, met a definite improvement in
demand for important products, pre
sumably the fruit of a prevailing eon
viction that new business will begin to
ferotvd the works after -tho nevvyeai
starts. .
The outward movement of wheal
and other products continues so heavy
that foreign exchange has fallen three
quarters of a cent, and instead of ex
ports of gold, which have marked De
cember in recent years, imports would
come if gold were, wanted.
Securities are advancing with rea
son in the increased earnings of rail
ways, 947,085,801 for November on re
porting roads in the United States,
16.8 per cent, larger than last year and
5.9 larger than in 1893. A striking
comparison for five years shows that
in each of the last three months earn
ings have been greater than in any
previous year, with a larger increase
in November than in October or Sep
te ruber.
The sudden rise in December wheat
at Chicago to $1.00 -would do harm
were it not based on avowed contracts
to ship some millions of bushels tc
Europe. That fact and the continued
foreign demand in spite of such con
tracts, has helped a rise of 13a cunts
here. Western receipts for the weelt
were 6,798,771 bushels apfainst.3,091,314
last yeart and Atlantic exports, includ
ing flour. 4,612,187, against 2,975,651
last year, and so great is the
foreign shortage (that the outgo
of corn last year, far greater
than ever before, is again exceeded
3,318,080 for the week, against 3,05;"), 780
a year ago, with the price nearly one
cent higher for tho week. The reports
that the western supplies are running
low are discredited by receipts from
farms.
Cotton is a sixteenth stronger, in
spite of estimates running from 10,
100,000 to 11,000,009 bales by well
known authorities. A strike in En
glish mills is no longer threatened,
and the possibility of one at Fall ; River
has little weight.
The demand for woolen goods has
clearly improved and moro wool has
just been purchased abroad and is be
ing imported, the sales in domestic
markets having been for the past week
only 2,600,000 pounds at Boston, and in
two weeks, 11.059,430 pouuds at the
three markets.
There is more demand for iron and
steel products in preparation for rail
way work, bridges and buildings next
year and on contracts for export,
including one for a government
bridge iu Holland, others for bridges in
Japan, with large shipments of various
products to England and other coun
tries. Foreign contracts for 40,000
tons of rails are pending. In and
about New York bridge and building
contracts call for 25,000 tons, and Chi
cago works are figuring on numerous
contracts for 5,000 railway cars. The
formation of the American Steel and
Wire Co. is expected to strengthen
prices and causes some buying.
A sale of lake copper, said to be 10,
000,000 pounds, at 11 cents, so
strengthens the demand that 10.87 is
bid; but tin and lead are dull and
spelter a shade lowef, while future
contracts for tin plates have been
made at 52.90 per hundred pounds.
Connellsville coke production is (51,
100 tons weekly against 149,000 in
November, and no advance is now ex
pected above $1.50 for furnace coke
early next year.
Failures in the first week of Decem
ber were but 2,617,240 manufactur
ing $739,420, and trading $1,791,570.
Failures throughout the United
States for the week have been SIS
against 3S0 last year and 29 in Canada
against 43 last year.
THE PACIFIC COAL TRUST.
United State Attorney Footo Directed U
I'roceed Against tbe Coal Dealers Aa
soclatlon of California.
Washington, De c. 11. The attornej
general yesterday directed United
States Attorney 11. S. Foote at Sar
Francisco to file a bill in equity
against the Coal Dealers' association of
California for violation of the anti
trust law of July 2, 1S90.
It is stated that the association is
composed of retail dealers of San
Francisco and has for its object the
control of the retail 'trade. The con
stitution and by-laws of the associa
tion, whicu have been under consid
eration in the department of justice
for some time, are said to disclose the
fact that the members are bound under
severe penalties not to sell coal at a
less price than is fixed by tho associa
tion and otherwise to observe all of its
rnles.
There are said to be other considera
tions imposed upon members which it
is alleged clearly bring the association
within the provisions of the law
against associations or combinations
formed with a view to the restraint of
trade or commerce.

Washing tos, Dec. 11. Ex-President
Grover Cleveland arrived in Washing

Arrest and Confession of -.Guilty Coapl.
Paris, Dec. 11. The mystery of the

of a couple named Carrara, enga ged in
the business of growing mushrooms.
Lamare, on November 0, called on
the Carra r as to collect some money,

A' NARROW ESCAPE.
Ptot. Alger, Ordnance Espert. Meets Wltb
a Severe Accident.
Washington, Dec 11. Prof. Philip
B. Alger, one of the foremost ordnance
experts in the government service,
sustained an accident yesterday after
noon, while examining one of the new
naval rifles, that came very near being
fatal. A cartridge was accidentally
exploded while the gun was in the
hands of Prof. Alger. The bullet,
propelled by the big charge ol
smokeless powder, struck the heavy
iron casing of a window and
smashed the half-inch iron, which
flew back in small fragments. Prof.
Alger was struck by several of the
pieces and received cuts, but the mosl
serious injury was caused by a piece oi
metal which severed the temporal
artery. Only the presence of mind oi
Constructor Dashiell, who was him
self hit by some pieces of the iron, bul
without injury, prevented what might
have been a fatal result, as be sprang
to the assistance of the professor and
held the wound tightly closed until
the surgeons arrived and stopped the
flow. Prof. Alger is now in no dan

GREAT POST OFFICE ROBBERY.
Amouut Bald to be About One Hundred
Thousand Dollars.
New York, Dec. 11. It was. learned
yesterday that one of the biggest rob
beries in the history of the New York
post office occurred on November 9.
The amount involved is said to be in
the neighborhood of $100,000, and was
taken from registered letters in the
railway mail service on that sec
tion of the Central Railway of
New Jersey known as the New York,
Somerville & Easton branch.

the barber who pleaded guilty to de
frauding an insurance company, and
who admitted that since 1863 he had
collected insurance on four wives, one

wears out women. Not ordinary house
work but hard labor with the hands,
trying to keep things clean without modern
