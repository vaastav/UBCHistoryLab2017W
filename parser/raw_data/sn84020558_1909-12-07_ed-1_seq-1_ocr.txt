ESTIMATES
OF THE COST
Olmsted Presents Figures
For Sewage System
FOOL ORDINANCE PASSED
Council Petitioned to Take
Action Toward the Mu
nicipal Ownership of An
Electric Light Plant
Other Weighty Matters
At the regular meeting of the city
council last night Frank H. Olmsted,
of the firm of Olmsieta and Gilleien.
consulting engineers, appointed bv the
city to draught a set of plans for a
sewerage system, presented the film's
estimates of the cost of an adequate
system.
One plan includes the use of the
present system and the other ignores
it The first will cost $J4i'.3oO and the
second tJSs.614. In plan Xo. 1 the city
will have to purchase the present sys
tem which is now in general use In
the business section of the citv. The
two systems will be combined and the
pilcs of one connected up with the
other. In plan Xo. 2 the present sys-'
t-m will be paralleled the new pipes
being laid considerably deeper than
the present mains.
The first plan will require the bond
ing of the city to the amount of $250,-
and the second 1300.000. The ex
tra money over the estimate is for ex
tensions not planned for, cost of elec
tion, etc.
The district embraced by the deep
line sewers in plan Xo. 2 comprises
the area between Fourth street. Fourth
avenue. Van Buren and Jackson
st reets.
This second set of plans will go' be
fore the board of engineers with the
first set submitted by the same firm
some months ago. This board of en
gineers, which was appointed last
night consists of W. A. Farish, L. G.
Knipe and O. C. Thompson. They will
be asked to pass upon the plans as
soon as possible as the contract be
tween the city and Olmsted and Gil
lelan calls for a second payment to
that firm of $1500 by December 15.
It was argued that a warrant should
tie issued for that amount payable on
the approval of the plans by the board
of engineers.
A petition was presented by Charles
Goldman and signal by 500 citizens
asking the city to take steps toward
nunicipal ownership of an electric
. lant for lighting. It will require the
Vending of the city for 200,00 and an
enabling act by congress. Owing to
tiie enormous amount of business
:'h-ail of the council action on the pe
tition was deferred till next Thursday
r.iuht which will be devoted to a con
sideration of it.
The ordinance permitting pool rooms
and bowling alleys, which are not con
ducted in connection with places where
liquor Is sold, to be open on Sunday,
was passed with two dissenting votes.
They were the mayor's and Council
man Campbell's. The ordinance as it
now stands also permits minors over
IS years of age to frequenfpool rooms
and bowling alleys.
A recommendation from the library'
tH.ard that A. K. Stabler be annointed
to the board in the place of W. C. Fos- j
ter. who resigned, was accepted and J
Mr. Stabler appointed.
Councilman Hackett's ordinance
prohibiting the sweeping of the side
walks in the business section of the
city was referred to the city attorney
and Mr. Hackett, that Its boundaries
might be slightly extended. The ordi
nance does not mean that the side
walks are always to go dirty not by
any means. It specifically states that
when necessity requires it the walks
may be hosed off but not later than
S a.m. or earlier than 2 p.m. Some
one wanted to Insert the word "must"
but it was ouickly shown that the city
ran hardly make a man clean off his
own sidewalk. So if the sidewalks be
come soiled there will he no remedy.
The district embraces Washington and
Adams streets between Third street
and Third avenue, and Central avenue
and First and Second streets and First
and Second avenues between Jefferson
and Monroe streets. The ordinance is
directed against the dissemination of
germs of all varieties.
Center street was changed to Central
avenue within the city limits. It is al
ready Central avenue beyond as far as
the Arizona canal.
Polk street and Dennis street were
straightened out. Dennis was changed
to Polk and Polk to DenniB. Those
living in the Dennis addition will prob
ably understand the meaning of the
change though it is somewhat puzzling
to others.

I
Real Purpose to Get Ruling on Law
fulness of Boycott
Washington, Dec. S. Before the su
preme court of the United States to

the American Federation of Labor,
will ask to have dismissed the origi
nal anti-boycott injunction issued by
Judge Gould in the Buck Stove and

ell and Morrison, the officers of the
federation, under a contempt sen
tence for a violation of the injunction
ure the parties to the apjieal.
This move puts it up to the su
preme court to decide if the federa
tion boycott of the Buck Stove and
Range company was a lawful pro
cedure. The stove company has already filed

ed as to be of practically no use for
the purpose for which it was sought.

issued today summoning Ida Brock
way to appear before the grand jury
on Friday to tel! what she knows about
the $613,000 shortage of Charles War
rlner, former treasurer of the Big Four
railroad. Miss Brockway left a $1500
position as stenographer for Frank
Coudcn, cashier of the office of the
United States collector of customs,
disappearing suddenly two weeks ago
and remained in hiding.
Late today she appeared at the office
of an attorney, but refused to make a
statement. Miss Brockway was a
room-mate of Mrs. Jeanette Stewart
Ford, the woman or one of the women,
in the Warriner case. They quarreled
soon after Warriner's confession and
Miss Brockway disappeared. She Is
said to be the one who tipped the
shortage to Couden. The prosecutor
promises a sensation when the grand
jury meets.

Fishkill. X. Y., Dec. 6 Miss Dauerty
daughter of Rev. Wm. Dauerty, wan
dered from a car where she left
friends yesterday. A . detective found
her body today in six feet of water at
the bottom of a cistern. The appear
ances indicate a carefully planned
suicide.
The girl was ambitious to make her
first year at Vassar creditable. She
knew her father had abandoned a rich
parish in Xew Jersey to accept a
small charge at Hudsonville so that
his daughter might live at home while
attending Vassar. Three weeks ago
she broke down. The thought that
her indisposition had nullified her
father's sacrifices so preyed upon her
mind that it was feared she might
attempt suicide and an effort was
made to keep a close watch on her.

ROTTONNESS UNEARTHED
. IN FIRE INSURANCE CO.
THE PHENIX PLUNDERED BY
ITS PRESIDENT.
State Insurance Officials Bribed to
Wink at Crime.
Xew york. Dec. . The Phenix In
surance company of Brooklyn, is under
investigation for irregularities, which
are believed to have impaired its sur
plus at least $1,000,000 and to have re
sulted in grounds for possible criminal
action.
Superintendent Hotchkiss of the
state insurance department laid the
matter before the district attorney. It
Is charged that the president has over
drawn salary, unloaded doubtful secu
rities upon the company and used the
company's assets as collateral to secure
private speculative accounts.
Geo. Sheldon, a member of many
clubs and chairman of the legal com
mittee of the Xatlonal Board of Fire
Underwriters, has been president of the
Phoenix since 1887. U is charged' that
under his administration the annual re
ports of the company for the last ten
years have been falsified and it is al
leged that questionable securities ori
ginally sold the company by Sheldon
have year after year passed through
the "wash sales" and have been thus
concealed In the annual reports. For
the last' seventeen years, it is alleged,
members of the state insurance depart
ment, whose duty it was to supervise
the company, have accepted collateral
loans from Sheldon, in amounts vary
ing from $4,000 to $100.0110. The Phe
nix insurance company does a fire bus
iness, is incorporated for $1,500,000 and
has a surplus of $ 1.000,00ft.
Among the loans to state insurance
officers specified are the following: to
James Pierce, former state superin
tendent. $.19,000; Isaac Vanderpool,
former chief-examiner, $100,000; Rob
ert Hunter, former first deputy super
intendent, $6n.i40; William Buckley,
third deputy, $61.0rt0. It is announced
tonight that at a meeting of the di
rectors Sheldon was removed and W. T.
Gray, formerly auditor of the Conti
nental Insurance company, was elected
president.

Aside from summoning 3-year-old

THE STRIKE
OF TRAINMEN
Is a Thing
mprobabte and
Not Con!
MR. TAFT IS
Demands, Says President of
Brotherhood, Could Not
Be Presented Before Next
Year. Not Believed Wages
Would Be Denied.
Chicago, Dec. 6. William I.ee, pres
ident of the Brotherhood of Railway
Trainmen, tonight sent a message to
President Taft, assuring him that the
sensational reports regarding a gen
eral strike were without foundation.
Lee's message to Mr. Taft said: In
order that you. and the public may
know the truth. I deem it necessary to
state that the press reports indicating
that a strike of the Brotherhood of
Trainmen and affiliated organizations
is threatened, as a result of demands
for increased pay in the territory east
or Chicago, is absolutely without
foundation. Tlie demands of the em
ployes on trains and in yard service
east of Chicago, cannot take a proper
form even for deliberate consideration i
between the railway officials and the
employes before the early part of 1910.
All talk about a strike of the Brother
hood of Trainmen, and the affiliated
organizations is absurd.
STORY WAS PREMATURE.
Xew York, Dec. 6. "Rumors of an
impending strike." said Vice President
Murdock. of the Brotherhood of Rail
way Trainmen, "is premature and I be
lieve they were circulated to influence
the roads of the northwest into grant
ing the demands of tw sw ltcbmeu'
union. We have nothing to do with
that movement. We have troubles
enough of our own.
"Our proposals have not been sub
mitted to the management of the east
ern railroads and we have no reason
to suppose that they will be refused
when they are submitted. It is no se
cret that we have long felt that we
are entitled to higher wages. The de
mand for them was deferred two years
ago, when the financial panic caused a
pause."
Well informed quarters said tonight
that us the railroads have long con
templated an increase in freight rates,
they are not in a position to treat the
request for an increase of wages too
brusquely.
THE SWITCHMEN'S STRIKE.
Seattle, Dec. 6. Steady progress to
ward, the full resumption of freight
service was made by the Great Xorth
ern and Xorthern Pacific railroads to
day, the freight offices being open for
the receipt of shipments.
It is reported that 2'0 strike-breaking
switchmen for various Puget
Sound cities coming west over the
Great Xorthern will arrive on Wednes
day. GOOD-BY, BABY.
A Sentiment That Will Appeal to Ev
ery Parent.
She stood at the front window the
other morning and gazed at the little
figure retreating up the street. She
watched him trudge bravely along un
til he turned the corner, the while her
chin ouivercd and the tears almost
blinded her. Then, when he had quite
disappeared from sight, the grip at her
throat almost stifled her, and going to
her room, she wept long and softly.
He was gone. Her little baby; her
first born. Gone, with never a
thought or a dream of the ache in the
heart of her who followed him to the
door, who held him close in her arms,
wiio kissed him so tenderly and tried
to smile bravely at him. Gone, with
never an idea of the big aching void
he left behind, ilone, with a smile on
his lips, a laugh in (lis voice, an ex
pectancy in his eyes, and a tingle in
every footstep. Gone, for his first day
at school.
A NEW DEFENSE
In the Case of H. Clay Pierce the Al
leged Perjurer.
Austin, Dec. 6. The chief contention
of the defense in the trial of H. Clay
Pierce, for alleged false swearing, was
that the state sought to hold Pierce
responsible for confessions made under
the immunity clause of Missouri.
This, it was contended, in connec
tion with the Texas law of 1907 grant
ing a like immunity, exonerated the
defendant from responsibility in con
nection with a' narrative of the history
of the Water-Pierce company.

the fifteen-year sentence in federal
prison is that of a motion for a new
trh.I filed today in the United States
