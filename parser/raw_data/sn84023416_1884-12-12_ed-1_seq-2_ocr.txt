Ulzt County raid, i
loANa POND, DECEMBER 12, 1S8-4.
The basis of popular government
is freedom of the ballot. The mad
partisans who ostracise and perse
cute their political adversaries do
their full share toward denying tliat
right. Violence of expression dur
ing a political campaign can be for
gotten, Vut when it is continued for
xrcets after an election has becu
held and certain men or bodies of
men are singled ont for denuncia
tion as if they liad Lecn guilty of
some grave offence, it is high time
to enquire if there is any basis for
dions tyranny thus sought to be
established ?
The Baltimore Sun has tSw foi
lowing; Senator Edmunds is report
cd to be somewhat indignant at the
criticism passed upon his alleged in
activity in the late campaign, more
eepecially as it is said he contends
that he has given a full equivalent
to his party for all the rewards re
ceived from it. His present term of
service in the Senate expires March,
837, at which time he will have
senred for a continuous period of
more than twenty rears. An inti
mate personal friend of his says Mr
Edmnndc, in his recent expressions,
shows that lie seriously contemplates
iSecTining to be a candidate for re
c.cction; mat uc ib moved to tbis
determination in some degree by
Ms resentment at the criticisms al
luded to, but perhaps as much by
Siis own delicate health and that of
liis wife and daughter.
Mr. Clark, the clerk of the House
f Representatives, has compiled
ihe list of names of members elect
tft the forty-ninth congress.. The
present congress consists of 201
(Democrats and 124 Republicans.
The next will consist of 184 Demo
'crats and 141 Republicans. The
Democrats have made a gain of 12
members, as follows: Florida, I;
Illinois, 2; Kentucky, 1; Maryland,
1 Michigan, 1; Mississippi, 2; No.
Carolina, 1; Texas 1, and Virginia
2. The Republicans have gained 29
members, as follows: California, 5;
"Connecticut, 1; Indiana, 1; Massa
chusetts, 1; Missouri, 2; Nevada, 1;
Kew York, 5; Ohio, 4; Pennsylvan
ia, 4; Tennessee, 1, and Wisconsin,
4. The number of members of the
forty-eighth congress re-elected, is
iured of re-election'" having Jm ore
than a majority in his favor.
HIE PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE.
It is the theory of our govern
ment t"hat the president shall call
the attention of congress at each
Session to the more important sub
jects of legislation that are likely to
oaie before it, but of late years it
has Leen the custom, and wisely we
think, to address the message as di
rectly to the people as to congress.
It is a message people, irrespective
of parties, should read with the
greatest care, as it discusses nearly
every question that closely affects
our national prosperity, and a close
readiug of it will give the voter a
clearer view of the great state ques
tions than can be obtained in any
other way. The last message of
the president is a clear and plain
presentation of many questions of
great interest and importance, which
he treats in that direct and forcible
manner that has characterized all
Jiis state papers. The portions of
the message most nearly and direct
ly affecting the people, are those
touching tho coinage of silver dol
lars, which he recommends to be
appended; the reduction of the sur
plus in the treasury, civil-service re
form, and the state of affairs in
XTt&lt As to the coinage of silver
dollars 4& direct statements made
embody the whole argument on that
subject. The aet that the treasury
is overburdened with these coins,
lhat they do not c'ircula.tg freely
;among the people, and that of two
ijnetallio legal tenders th cheaper
Will always drive out the more vai-j
ab!e from circulation, are conclus
ive as to the 'inference the president
tbaws ;and jthfl recommendations bas
ted thereof, jfjj studying his con
clusions as to tbe tariff it must be
borne in mind that the president is
ilie protective tariff gystjam that has
iieeo or many years the jcliey of
iiie -g'Wfcuuei!t( .and tli.ene is, in
Hr this, .sftaojal significance j
his declaratloH that -"our system of
a revemifi in xwui r( a nvaaant.
needs of the goycrnrajent." How
.this is to be obviated the president
4ocg not say directly, but ho no"iirf,
ut lour methods by whieh our for-
wg' imae can oe mcrcinea ana out
. !.. 4 M 1 -l ...!il.
uinjjuocu VV L 1 Lli'
xut in aiKy makiner such a ro-
(Auctioj? in ,th tariff as shall hazard
our industrial enterprises or reduce
the, standard of wages to the level
of that in some other countries.
Tho stand taken by the president
upon the question of reform, in our
civil service must prove acceptable
to those of all parties in this coun
try who pl ice a high value upon the
principles involved. The treatment
of the Utah question is short and
vigorous. In its efforts to stamp
out polygamy from that Territory
he advues congress to be limited on
ly by the restraints of the constitu
tion in radical legislation for the
suppression of that abominable prac
tice. What the president savs unon
the subject of our seacoait defences
will 6trike the reader a timely and
important. Almost the only point
in the message with which we should
take issue with the president is his
recommendation regarding the re
moval of internal-revenue taxes from
tobacco, cigars, and verythig else
except spirituous liquors. We be
Iveve that taxes, if imposed at all,
should be placed upon the luxuries
and not the necessities of life. The
tax upon tobacco is 'a burden to no
one, for a man who can afford to
use it at all can afford to pay the
small tax such use involves, or he
can discontinue it. The message is,
however, an admirable one, and full
of common sense that the pcojie
will appreciate.
OUK WASIIIXGTOV LETTER.
Regular Correspondence of tho IIekald.J
It is not expected that anything
of national importance will be done
in Congress until after tho holiday
adjournment. In the meantime the
Committees will be at work, and on
the re-assembling Monday, Jan. I
they will all be ready to report an
make short work of the appropria
tion and other bills that demand at
tention. There is an evident dispo
sition on the part of Democrats to
do very little in tho way of fore
shadowing their policy until after
the inauguration of President Clevc
land.
The party has been so long out
of power and acting in the minority
that it does not readily come to the
front as the majority party. When
the new Congress shall assemble
next December, President Cleveland
will have developed his policy, and
Ins party will be ready to take defin
ite position for the future,
The Republicans will not inter
pose any factious opposition to Mr
Cleveland's appointments, and wil
the
country s good. It is not
thought here that there will be any
laoieat changes attempted either in
the policies of the government or
conduct of its affairs until after the
party has the reins of government
well in hand. Every effort will be
made to court the favor of the peo
pie and prevent any violent changes
until there is a feeling of perfect
safety and quietude, and changes of
every character will be made so
gradually that they will not be no
ticed until the awakening hour shal
come.
Every effort is to be made to cou-
i"11 Democratic control
in the
Northern States that went Demo
cratic in November, and to try and
add to that number two years from
now in the hope that by that time
the control of the Senate may pass
into Democratic hands. In the mean
time, Dakota with her half-million
people asking, and justly entitled to
be admitted as two States, Arizona
with her 200,000 people, and Wash
ington, population sufficient to form
a State, will be kept out in the cold
m fi . i . .
as Aerniones, so that their votes
may not be counted in 1888.
Texas will apply to be divided in
to three States, and a strong effort
made to accomplish the division,
but if antagonized with the propo
sition of the admission of the Ter
ntories as stated, nothing will be
done, for it is in the Democratic
mind to keep these Republican Ter
ritories in their present condition to
prevent their votes being cast for
the Republican nominees iu 1888
Th is is the outlook now ; what
Ivepubhcans will do, and what they
will submit to, is in the future. It
is pleasant to know that there is to
day a hopeful feeling pervading the
party, and do disposition to be cast
down or dismayed. In fact Demo
crats are surprised to find that the
grand old party is just as united,
just as firm and inflexible jn its de
mands for the right, as it has been
in all its history in the past. It has
not marched to the rear, has not
surrendered or luid down its arm,'
but takes its temporary repulse as a
.njef,e incident in its career, feeling
tli at ilia time and occasion will soon
arise wh it will go forth to victo
ry.
Democratic njembers of Congress
ana already having a taste of some
iof the unpleasant things which go
with politiea, siwftpss, in the flood
of appikMtaua tex vojSwc, Thou-
pands of demands for places aie
coming in from every seotion from
people who writrt as though they
confidently expected a reply by re
turn mail to " come on." The most
amusing feature of theso applica
tions is that they almost invariably
call for. positions with little work
and big pay, the applicants being
poor in ljealth, with great demands
upon their purses. Contrary to the
opinion that generally prevails
atuonj the unknowing ones, a gov
ernment clerkship in Washington is
an undesirable position. No young
man who is earning or can earn an
honest living at home or away from
Washington should give it up to
come here and take a clerkship.
Ask your Senator, Representative,
or any one else who knows, if your
correspondent is not exactly right
with respect to this matter.
President Arthur's recommenda
tion in his last message that General
Grant be given a life pension, was
not the outgrowth of sentiment, but
was brought about by a presenta
tion to him of the necessities of the
old General 's condition. It seems
that tho managers of the fund that
was presented to General Grant sev
eral years ago made a bad invest
ment of it, and that it really amounts
to nothing now. The payment of
interest on the fund was guaranteed
by several gentlemen for stated
number of years, but the guarantee
time has nearly expired, aud what
was thought to be ample provision
for the wants of the old hero as
long as he should live, has vanished
like his other means and left him sub
stantially without anything on which
to depend. General Logan will put
the President's recommendations in
the matter mentioned in tho way of
being carried out so far as the Sen
ate is concerned. c. u.
