THE PRESIDENTS MESSAGE
Gentlemen of the Congress: The
year that has elapsed since I last
stood before you to fulfill my consti
tutional duty, to give, to the Congress
from time to time information on the
state of the Union has been so crowd
ed with great events and great results
that I cannot hope to give an ade
quate picture of its transactions or of
its far reaching changes, which have
been wrought in the life of our na
tion and of the world. You have your
selves witnessed these things, as I
have. It is too soon to assess them,
and we who stand in the midst of
them and are part of them are less
qualified than men of another genera
tion will be to say what they mean
0 reven what they have been. But
some great outstanding facts are un
mistakable and constitute in a sense
part of the public business with which
it is our duty to deal. To state them
is to set the stage for the legislative
and executive action which must grow
out of them and which wehave yet to
shape and determine.
Reviews Growth of American Forces
A year ago we had sent 145,918 men
overseas. Since then we have set 1,
950,513, an average of 162,542 each
month, the number in fact rising, in
May last, to 245,951, in June to 278,
760, in July to 307,182, and continu
ing to reach similar figures in. August
and September in August. 289,570,
and in September 257,438. ( No such
movement of troops ever took place
before, across 3000 miles of sea, fol
lowed by. adequate equipment and
supplies, and carried through extra
ordinary dangers of attack-r-dangers
which were alike strange and infinite
ly difficult to guard against. In all
this movement only 758 men were lost
by enemy attack 630 of whom were
upon a single English , transport,
which was sunk near the Orkney Isl
ands. I need not tell you whatlay back of
this great movement of men and ma
terial. It is not. invidious to say that
back of it lay a supporting organiza
tion of the industries of the country
and of all its productive activities
more complete, more thorough in
method and effective in result, more
spirited and unanimous in purpose
and effort than any other great bel
ligerent had been able to effect.
We profited greatly by the experi
ence of the nations which already had
been engaged :f or nearly three years
in the exigent and exacting business,
their every resource and every execu
tive proficiency taxed to the utmost.
We were their pupils, but we learn
ed quickly and acted with a promptr
ness and a readiness of co-operation
that justify our great pride that we
are able to serve the world with un
paralleled energy and quick accom
plishment. High Praise for American Fighting
Men
But it is not the physical scale and
executive efficiency r. of - preparation,
supply, equipment and despatch that
1 would dwell upon, but the mettle
and quality of the officers and men
we sent over and of the sailors who
swept the seas, and the spirit of the
nation that stood behind them. No
soldiers or sailors ever proved them
selves more quickly ready for the test
of battle or acquitted themselves with
more splendid courage and achieve
ment when put to the test. Those of
us who played some part in directing
the great processes by which the war
was pushed irresistibly forward to the
final triumph may now forget all that
and delight our thoughts with the
story of what our men did.
Their officers understood the grim
and exacting task they had undertak
en and performed it with an audacity,
efficiency and unhesitating courage
that touch the story of convoy and
battle with- imperishable distinction
at every turn, whether the enterprise
were great or small from their great
chiefs, Pershing and Sims, down to
the youngest lieutenant, and their men
were worthy of them such men as
hardly need to be commanded, and go
to ' their terrible adventure blithely
and with the quick intelligence of
those who know just what it is they
would accomplish. , '

tryman of men . of such stuff and
valor. Those of us who stayed at
home and did our duty; the war could
not have been won or the gallant men
who fought it given their opportunity
to win it otherwise; but for many a
long day we shall think ourselves "as
cursed we were not there, and hold
our manhood cheap while any speaks
that fought," with those at St. Mihiel
or Thierry. The memory of those
days of triumphant battle will go with
these fortunate men to their graves;
and each will have his favorite mem
ory. "Old men forget; ye all shall
be , forgot, but hell remember with
advantages what feats he did that
day!"
What we all thank God for with
deepest gratitude is that our men
went into the line of battle just at the
critical moment when the whole fate
of the world seemed to hang in the
balance and threw fresh strength
into the ranks of freedom in time to
turn the whole tide and sweep of the
fateful struggle turn it once for all,
so that henceforth it was back, back,
back for their enemies, always back,
never again forward!
Empires in Liquidation
After that it was only a scant four
months before the commanders of the
central empires knew themselves
bea.ten; and now their very empires
are in liquidation!
And throughout it all how fine the
spirit of the nation was, what unity of
purpose, what untiring zeal; what ele
vation of purpose ran through all its
splendid display of strength, its un
tiring accomplishment. - I have said
that those of us who stayed at home
to do the work of organization and
supply will always wish that we had
been with the men whom we sustain
ed by our labor; but we can never be
ashamed.
It has been an inspiring thing, to be
here in the midst of fine men who had
turned aside from every private in
terest of their own and devoted the
whole of their trained capacity to the
tasks that supplied the sinews of the
whole great undertaking. '
The patriotism, the unselfishness,
the thorough-going devotion and dis
tinguished capacity that marked their1
toilsome labors day after day, month
after month, have made them fit
mates and comrades of the men in
the trenches and on the sea. And not
the men here in Washington only.
They have but directed the vast
achievement.- Throughout innumer
able factories, upon innumerable
farms, in the depths of coal mines
and iron mines and copper mines,
wherever the goods of industry were
to be obtained and prepared, in, the
shipyards, on the railways, at the
docks, on the sea, in every labor that
was needed to sustain the battle lines,
me nhave vied with each other to do
their part and do it well.
They can look any man-at-arms in
the face, and say, "We also strove to
win and gave the best that was in us
to make our fleets and armies sure of
their triumph. And what shall we
say of the women of their constant
intelligence, quickening every task
that they touched; their capacity for
organization and co-operation, which
gave their action discipline and en
hanced the effectiveness of everything
they attempted; their aptitude at
tasks to which they had never before
set their hands; their utter self-sacrifice
alike in what they did and in what
they gave? Their contribution to the
great result is beyond appraisal. They
have added' a new lustre to the an
nals of American womannood.
The least tribute we can pay them
is to make them the equals of men in
professional right as they have prov
ed themselves their equals in every
field of practical work they have en
tered, whether for, themselves or for
their country. These great days -, of
completed achievement would be sad

EX-KAISER IS A PIRATE AND
SLAVE TRADER IN THE OPIN
ION OF THE ALLIES
(Associated Press)
London. Dec. Z A demand for the
surrender of the former German em
peror will be submitted to the Neth
erlands government in the name of
all the allied cabinets, according to
the Express. The views of France
and Italy have been fully communi
cated to the British government and
President Wilson has also made sug
gestions relative to the procedure in
the case.
The opinion is held that Holland
will not put obstacles in the way. She
will not be asked to deliver William
under ordinary extradition laws, but
by his status the former .emperor will
be -considered analogous to a pirate
and slave trader, who is not regarded
as entitled to sanctuary in any coun
try. .

ernment is still undecided as to how
to, deal with the former emperor and
the Hohenzollerns," said Hugo Haas,

German cabinet, to a correspondent of
the Express Sunday. Haas said, "I
think they may be sufficiently punish
ed by the international odium they
have incurred."

of the country have been the moving
spirits in the systematic economies by
which our people have voluntarily as
sisted to supply the suffering peoples
of the world and he armies upon
every front with food and eevrything
else that we had that might serve the
common cause. The details of such
a story can never be fully written,
but we carry them at our hearts and
thank God that we can say that we
are kinsmen of such.
Sure of Great Triumph
And now we are sure of the great
triumph for which every sacrifice was
made. It has come, come in its com
pleteness, and with the pride and in
spiration of these days of achievement
quick within us we turn to the taskt
of peace again a peace secure
against the violence of irresponsible
monarchs and ambitious military co
teries and made ready for a new
order, for new foundations of justice
and fair dealing.
We are about to give order and or
ganization to this peace, not only for
ourselves, but for the other peoples
of the world as well, so far as they
will suffer us to serve them. It is in
ternational justice that we see, not
domestic safely merely. Our thoughts
have dwelt of late upon Europe, upon
Asia, upon the .near and far east,
very little upon the acts of peace and
accommodations that wait to be per
formed at our own doors. While we
are adjusting our relations with the
rest of the world, is it not of capital
importance that we should clear away
all grounds' of misunderstanding with
our immediate neighbors and give
proof of the friendship we really
feel?
Recalls Colombia Treaty
I hope that the members of the
Senate will permit me to speak once
more of the unratified treaty of
friendship and adjustment with the
republic of Colombia. I very earnest
ly urge upon them an early and fav
orable action upon that vital matter.
I believe that they will feel, with me
that the stage of affairs is now set for
such action as will be not only just
but generous and in the spirit of the
new age upou which we have so hap
pily entered.
Do Not Wait to Be Coached
So far as our domestic affairs are
concerned" the problem of our return
to peace is a problem of economic
and industrial readjustment. That
problem is less serious for us than it
may turn out to be for the nations
which haVe suffered the disarrange
ments and the losses of war longer
than we. Our people, moreover, do
not wait to be coached and led. They
know their own business, are quick
and resourceful at every readjust
ment, definite in purpose and self
reliant in action. Any 'leading strings
we might seek to put them in would
speedily become hopelessly tangled,
because they would pay no attention
to them and go their own way.
All that we can do as their legis
lative and executive servants is "to
mediate the process of change here,
there and elsewhere as we may.

plans that should be formed and per
sonally conducted to a happy consum
mation, but from no quarter have I
seen any general scheme of "recon
struction" emerge which I thought it
likely we could force our spirited
business men and self-reliant laborers
to accept with due pliancy and obed
ience. While the war lasted we set up
many agencies by which to direct the
industries of the country in the ser
vices it was necessary for - them to
render; by which to make sure of an
abundant supply of . the n materials
needed; by which to check undertak
ings that could for the time be dis
pensed with and stimilate those that
were most serviceable in war; by
which to gain for the purchasing de
partments of the government jbl cer
tain control over the prices of essen
tial articles and materials; by which
to restrain trade with alien enemies,
make the most of the available ship
ping and systematize financial trans
actions both public and private, so
that there would be no unnecessary"
conflict or confusion; by which, in
short, -to put every material, energy
of the country in harness to draw the
PRESIDENT THREE.. y-
common load and make of us one team
in the accomplishment of a great task.
But the moment we knew the ar
mistice to have been signed we took J
the harness off. Raw materials upon
which the government had kept its
hand for fear there should not be
enough for the industries that sup
plied the armies, have been released
and put into the general ' market
again, ureat industrial plants, whose
whole output and machinery had been
taken over for the use of the govern
ment are free to return to the uses to
which they were put before the war.
It has not been possible to remove so
readily or so quickly the control of
foodstuffs and of shipping because the
world has still to be fed from "our
granaries and the ships are still need
ed to send supplies to our men over
seas and to bring the men back as
fast as the disturbed conditions on the
other side of the water permit; but
even here restraints are being relaxed
as much as possible and more and
more as the weeks go by.
Government Bureaus Well Informed
Never before has there been agen

knew so much of the field of supply,
of labor and of industry as the war
industries board, the war trade board,
the labor department, the food admin

have known since their labors became
thoroughly systematic and they have
not been isolated agencies; they have
been directed by men which reported
the permanent . departments of the

of unified and co-operative action. It

AN EXHIBIT AT THE
SOUTH FLORIDA FAIR
At an informal meeting of a few of
the city's business men at the board
of trade rooms yesterday afternoon, it
was decided to look into the matter- of
making a Marion county exhibit at
the South Florida Fair to be held at
Tampa some time in February.
The meeting was presided over by
Mr. R. S. Hall, president of the Mar
ion County Fair Association, who ap
pointed Mr. Z. C. Chambliss a com
mittee to confer with the fair author
ities in regard to Marion's exhibit.
Mr. Chambliss is now in Jacksonville
attending the National Fanners' Con
gress, and while there win make final
arrangements for our exhibit at Tam
pa. diation at every point and in every
matter where it was desired. It is
surprising how fast the process of re
turn to a peace footing has' moved the
three weeks since the fighting stop
ped. It promises to outrun any in
quiry that may be instituted or aid
that may be offered., tl may not be
easy to direct it any better than it
will direct itself. The 'American bus
iness man is of quick initiative.
Orderly and normal processes of
initiative, however, will not provide
immediate work for all workers.
There are skilled workmen who have
acquired familiarity with established
businesses, those who are ready and
willing to go to the farms. All those
whose aptitude is known or will be
sought out by the employers will find
no difficulty it is safe to say, in find
ing places of employment. But there
will be others who will be at a loss
where to ,gain a livelihood unless
pains are taken to guide, them and
put them in the way of work. There
will be a large floating residum of la
bor which should not be left wholly
to shift for itself. It seems to me
therfore, important that the develop
ment of public works' of every sort!
should be promptly resumed, in order
that opportunities- should be created
for unskilled labor in particular and
that plans should be made for such
developments of our unused lands and
our natural resources as we have
hitherto lacked stimulation to under
take. Calls Attention to Colony Plan
A particularly direct your attention
to the very practical plans that the
secretary of agriculture has made in
his annual report and to committees
of reclamation of arid swamp and cut
over lands which might, if the states
were willing and able to co-operate,
redeem some 300,000,000 acres of land
for cultivation. There are said to be
fifteen, or twenty million acres of land
in the west at present arid, for whose
reclamation water is available if
properly conserved.

CATTS TRIES TO PASS THE BUCK
And Lay Blame for the Marianna
- School on the Members of
His Cabinet
(J. E. Worthington in Tampa Times)
Tallahassee, Dec. 2 "The Marianna
school isn't the only state institution
that hasn't been run as it should be,"
said the governor to the Times cor
respondent. .
"When the legislature is over and I
have a little time I shall have some
thing to say to the people of the state
unless there are some changes made,"
he went on to say.
He would not say at this time just
what institution or branch of the
state affairs he meant, but asserted
strongly that he would be able to take
the lid off when the time came if he
thought it the right thing to do.
He reiterated what he has said at
other times, that he has known of
conditions at Marianna for some time.
He even went so far as to secure some
affidavits at one time, but the rest of
the board would not believe that Su
perintendent Boone was not handling
things to the best advantage, accord
ing to the governor and, as he states,
would not stand with him in his ef
forts to remove Boone some time ago.
"One member of the board used to
go shooting with his brother," said the
governor, "and this influence was
brought to bear on the board. I was
but one member and could do noth
ing.
"Yes, it is true that perhaps I ought
to have given the matter publicity but
didn't and things went on until
there was a very bad condition there.
I didn't know the boys were starving
but I did feel for a long time that the
superintendents wasn't the right man
for the place. He was not able to
control the boys in any t way."
The governor went on to point out
that he could do nothing in the way
of removing members of the board.
They are state officers, the same as
he, and subject to impeachment - for
crime, but not to removal by him.
