After a brtel interval the Congress ef tbe
\Jm?e* States resumes iu annual iegietaUve
labora. Aa all- wiee and merciful Providence
has abated tbe pestilence which vtsitea our
sberee, leaving its calamitous trace* apou
iww poruoae ?f our country Peace, order,
tranquility. aad civil authority have been fores
ally declared to viiit tarougbout tbe whole
W ike Vetted Slates. In all of tbe States civil
authority ha* superseded iae coerciauof arm*,
und tbe peoyle, by their veluniary action, are
maintaining their governments la fail activity
ar d cvinpiew* operation. The enforcement of
the lawi is no longer "obstructed in aay Stare
by combinations too powerful to be suppressed
by tbe ordinary course of judicial prooeedup;"
aud the animosities engendered by tha
w?r are rapidly yielding to tbe beuidceat indue
noes of our tree institutions, and to the
kindly effects ol unreeirictea social tad commercial
intercourse. An enure restoration of
irateraal feeling mart be tbe earnest with of
very patriotic heart: and we will have ar.
lorapitabed our grandest national achievement
when. forgetting the sad event* of tbe pasu
and Temembering only tbeir instructive leu.
? * *. we resume our onward career as a tree,
y roeperous, and united people.
i? my message of ibeitb of December. I-? 5,
t*?cgres? was informed of the measure* wbich
had been instituted by tbe Executive with a
vsew to tbe gradual restoration of tbe States
ia wbKb the insurrection occurred to their
relation!* with tbe <r**ueral Governmeut. Provisional
Governors bad been appointed, Con.
ventions called, (ioveruors eKted. Degisiaturea
assembled, and Senators aud Represen taiives
chosen to tbe Congress ot the United
States. Courta bad been opened for the en.
forceinent ot laws long ? abeyance. The block.
ade hail teen removed, custom-bouses re-established,
and the internal revenue laws put
>u lorce, in order tbat tbe people might con.
tribute to the na'ional income. Postal oper.
U lions bud been renewed, and efforts were be.
ing made to restore them to tbeir former con.
dition ol etliciency. lue States themselves
had oeen a.-ked to rake part in the high func.
ticn ot amending tbe Constitution, and of thus
sanctioning the ex miction of African slavery
a* one of the legitimate results of our internecine
struggle.
Having progressed thus far, tbe Executive
Department found that it h?d accomplished
nearly all that was within the scope of its con.
siituiions.1 authority. One tiling, bowever. yet
remained to be done before the work of restoration
could be completed, and that was tbe
aumiasion to Congress of loyal Senators and
Kepresentatives lrom the States whose people
had rebelled agaiu?t the lawful authority of
the General Government. This question devolved
upon the respective Houses, which, by
the Constitution, are made the judges of the
elections, returns, and qualifications of their
own members: and its consideiatiou at once
engaged the attention of Congress.
In the meantime, tbe Executive Department
?no other plan having been proposed by Congress?continued
its efforts to perfect, a- far as
was practicable, the restoration of the proper
relations between the cui/.eus of the respective
States, tbe Stales, and the Federal Governmenu
extending, from time to time, as the pubhe
interests seemed to require, the judicial,
reveuue. and poetal systems of the country.
W r.h the advice and con?eut of tbe Senate, the
necessary aflicers were appointed, aud appropriations
made by Ccngre-d for tbe payment
of their salariea. The proposition to amend
tbe Federal Constitution, so is U> prevent the
existence of slavery within tbe United States
or any place subject to their jurisdiction, was
ratiiied by the requisite number of States; and
on tbe lsth day ot December, 1SG5, it was officially
declared to have becom** valid as a
part of the Constitution of the United State-.
All ot the States in which tbe insurrection had
existed promptly amended their constitutions,
so as to make them conlorm 'o the greatchaui<e
tnus effected in the orgauic law ot the land:
declared r.ull and void all ordinances and
laws ot seet-ssion. repudiated all pretended
debt- :md i. blip a' ions created for tbe revolutionary
purposes oi tbe m^urrecuon; and proceeded,
in good faith, lo the enactment ol measures
1> r the protection and amelioration of the condition
of :he colored race. Congress, ho we?er
yet hesitated to admit any of me?e Slates to
represeuiation. and it waa not until toward
the close of tbe etgbth nion b of the session
that an exception waa made in favor of Tennessee,
by tbe admission of her Senators and
Sf preventatives.
1 deem it a subject of profound regret that
Congress b:i* thus lar tailed to admit to seals
loyal Senators and Representatives trom the
otner States, whoee inhabitants, with those of
Tennessee, bad engaged in the rebellion Ten
States?more tban one-fourth ot tbe whole
number?remain without representation; the
seats of fllty members in the House of Kepresentan
ves and of tweaty members in tbe Seaate
are yet vacant?not by their own consentnot
by a failure of election, but by tbe refusal
oi Congress to accept their credentials. Their
admission, it ia believed, would have accomplished
much towards the renewal and
strengthening of our relation* as one people,
and removed serious cause for discontent on
the part of tbe inhabitants of those States It
wen Id have accordtd with the great principle
enunciated in tbe Declaration of American Independence,
tbat no people ought to bear tbe
bnrden of taxation, and yet be denied tbe right
ol representation. It would have been m consonance
wr.h the express provisions of the
Constitution, that each State shall have at
least one Kepresentati ve," and '-that no State,
wi bout its consent, aball be deprived af its
equal suffrage in the Senate." These provisions
were intended to secure to every State,
and to tbe people ot every State, the right of
representation in each House of Congress; and
so important was it deemed by the tramers of
the Constitution tbat toe equality of the
States in the Senate should oe preserved, thai
not even by an amendm-nt of tne Constitution
can any State, without its consent, be denied a
voice in that branch ef tbe National legislature.
It is true, it has been assumed that the exitence
of the States was terminated by ihe rebellious
acts of their inhabitants, and that tbe
nsnrrectlon having been suppressed, they
wers thencelornard to be considered merely
-is conquered territories. The legislative.
Executive, and Judicial Departments of the
< iovernmmt have, bowever, with great dismctnesft
ai.d uniform consistency, refused to
sanction an assumption soincompanole with
the nature of our republican system, and wilh
the professed objects ofthj war. Throughout
the re. rut legislation of Congress, tbe undeniable
tact makes itself apparent, thai the*: ten
political communities are nefUing I?w? than
States of this Union. At the very commencement
of tbe rebellion, each House declared,
with a unanimity as remarkable as it was significant,
that the war vtas not "waged, upoa
our pari, in any spirit of oppression, nor for
any purpose of conquest or subjugation, ror
purpose of overthrowing or interfering w.tb
the rights or established institutions of those
Statee. but to defend and maintain the supremacy
of the Constitution and all laws made iu
pursuance tbereo', and to preserve the Union
w ith all the dignity, equality, and rightaof tbe
several States unimpaired and tbat as soou as
'bese ebxeta" were - accomplished the war
ought to erase." In some instances, Senators
were I^'tirted to continue their legislative
luni'tita*, while in other instances Kepresentati
ves were elected and admitted le seats after
their Mates bad formally declared their right
to withdraw from the Union, and were eai.eavoring
to maintain that right b> force of
arms. All of these States whose people were
1n Insi rrectiou, as States, were included in
tLe apportionment of tbe direct taa of tweuly
millions of dollars annually laid upaQ mi
United Stales by the act approved 5th Aa?u?f,
I-61. Congress, by the act of March 4
iSPJ, and by the apportionment ol representation
thereunder, alse recognized their presence
xe States in the l oicn; and ibey have, fur JU.
dicta! purposes, bet?a divided into districts, us
States alone can be divided. The same recogi.lUon
appears in tbe recent l<gisla'ion In retfrence
to Tennessee, which evidently rests
up.n the-fact ibat the functions of the State
viere not destroyed by the rebellion, but mere.
!y?iurpend>d and that principle ij of course
'.j ; livable to those States which, like Tenues.
? attempted to renonnee their place* tn itie
IVlCB
Tbe action of the Executive Department of
tbe i;overmnept upoa ibis subject has been
equally definite and uniform, and tbe purpoee
ol i!.?- war was specifically stated in the Proc-1
tarnation Mated by my pr?dsc*Mor ua tbe *Jd

In the admission of Senators and Representatives
from an j and all of th* States, there can
ne no i??t gronnd of apprehension that persona
who are disloyal will be clotbed with th?
power* of legislation; for this eon Id not happen
wbea the Constitution and the law* are enforced
by a vigilant and faithful Uon#r??s.
Each House ia made the "judge of tb.? election?,
returns, and qualifications ol its owi
members," and may, "with the concurrent of
two-thirds, expel a member." When a S-nator
or Representative presents his certificate of
election, he may at once be admitted or rejected
or, should there be any question as to bis eligibility,
his credentials may be referred for
investigation to the appropriate commit'ee. If
aomrtpd to a seat, it must be apon evidence
satisfactory to the House of which tie thus
becomes h member,'hat he possesses tb" requu
ai'e constitutional and legal qunifications. If
r* fused admission as a member for want of due
allegiance to the Government aud returned to
his constituents, they an- admonished that
none but persons loyal to the United States
will r-.e allowed a rotee in the L^>gi?ia'ive
Councils of the Nation, aud the political power
and moral influence of Congress are thus
eflectively exerted >n the interests of loyalty ro
the Government and fidelity to the Union.
T'pon this question, so vitally affecting the
restoration of the Iinion and the permanency
of our present form of government, my con- !
ictiouf', heretofore expressed. have miderguue }
r.o change; but, on the contrary, their correctBets
has been confirmed by reflection and time. .
If the admission of loyal members 10 seats in 1
the respective Houses of Congress was wise
and expedient a year ago, it is no less wise I
and expedient now. If this anomalous cou- |
tiltioR is right now?if. in the exact condition
of these States at the present time. It is lawful
to exclude them from representation, I do not
see that the question will be changed by (he
efllnx of time. Ten years hence, if tuese Stat, s
remain as . v are, the right of representation
will be no Stronger? the rightorexclud.oaw.il
be no weaker.
The Constitution of the T'nited State- mtk?*s
it the duty of the President to recommend o
the consideration of Congress "such measures I
as he fhall jndge *eCes?ary or expedient." 1
know of no measure more imperatively de.
manded by every consideration of national
interest, sound policy, and equal justice, than I
the admission of loval members from the now I
unrepresented States. This would consummate
the work of restoration, and exert a mo t
salutary influence In the re-establishment of
peace, harmony, and fraternal feeling. It
would tend greatly to renew the confidence of
the American people in the vigor and stability
ot their institutions. It would bind ns more
closely together as a nation, and enable ns to
show to the world the inherent and recuperative
power of a Government founded npon the
will of the people, and established upon the
principles of liberty, justice, and intelligence.
Our increaoed strength and enhanced pro*- I
perity would irrefragibly demonstrate the fAi.
lacy of the arguments against free institutions
drawn from onr recent national disorders by
the enemies of republican government. The
admission ol loyal members from the Stated
now excluded from Congress, bv allaying
doubt and apprehension, would tn'rn capital,
now awaiting an opnortnnity for inre-,tineninto
the channels or trade and indu-'ry It
would alleviate the present troubled condition
of those States, and. by inducing emigration, I
aid m the settlement of lertile regions novJ
uncuiti\ ated, and lead to an tin rea-etl pntlti - i
tion of those staple* which have aid*"! a(>
greatly to the wealth of the nation and th >
Commerce of the world. New fields of enterprise
would be opened to onr progressive peo- I
pie. and souu 'he devastations of war w mid
be r?paired, and all traces of our domestic I
differences efTnced from tbemind* of onrcoantry
men.
In oiireff'oru to preserve "the uni'y of Government
which Constitutes ns one people." by I
restoring the states io the condition which I
they held prior te ih? rebellion, we should b-? I
cautious, fe?t, having rescued onr nation from
perils of threatened disint. gration. w? resort
to tonsolidation. and in the end absolute despotism.
as a remedy for the recurrence of similar
trouble*. '1 he war having terminated, and.
with it all occasion for the exercise of powers
of doubtful con?titutionalitv. we should hasten
to b" ing legislation within the boun lanes
preeenbed by the Constitution, and r.? return'
to the ancient landmarks tt?tablishe,i by oar
fathers, for the guidance of succeeding generation*.
"The Constitution which at any time
exists, until changed by an explicit and anthent.c
act of the whole |te<>p|?, in sacredly oh- I
ligatory up ,.n ail.' "If. |u the opinion of the
people, the distribution or raodifl cation of the
<?. t?t.iutional powers be. in any particular^
wrong, let it be corrected t-y an amendment in
the way in which the Constitution designates. I
Hut let tbete be no chance by usurpation; for'"
"l is the customary weapon by which free
Governments are destroyed." Wasimi?<;tu1i
spoke these words to his countrymen, when,
tot lowed by their love and gratitude, be voluntarily
retired from the cares of public life
"To keep in all things within the pale of our
constitutional powers, and cherish the Federal
Lnlon as the only rock ol ealety," were prescribed
by Jxppxbhon as rulos or action toenl?
hl8 "conntrymen the true principles of
tofir Constitution. tod promote a nnioa |
sentiment and action equally auspicious t? I
their happiness and saftty." jackso* held that
the action of the General Go vernment should I
always be strictly conbned tn tbe sphere of Its
appropriate datiee, and justly and forcibly
urged that onr Government is aot ic be main tained
nor onr Union preserved "by in vasions
or the rights and powers or the several States.
In thus attempting to roakeour General Government
strong, ws make it weak. Its true
strength consists in leaving individuals and
States as mr?h as possible to themselves; in
mat ing itseif felt, not in its power, bat in its
betw tcence; not in its control, but in its protection;
noun binding tbe States more closely
to the center, but leaving eacn to move uuob.
strutted in it*, proper constitutional orbit."
These are tbe teacbiugs of men wbwse deeds and
services have made them illustnons, and who,
long since withdrawn from tbe scenes of HK
have left to Uieir country tbe rich legacy of
their example, their wisdom, and their patriotism.
Drawing fresn inspiration from
their lessons let ns emulate them in love of
country and respect tor the Constitution and
the laws.
Tbe report of the Secretary of tbe Treasury

enne and commerce ot tbe country. His views
npon tbe currency. an<fcwitb reference to a
propeT adjustment ef oar revenue system, internal
as well as impeet, are commended to
tbe careful consideration of Congress. In my
last annual message 1 expressed my general
Views upon these eubjects. I need now only
call attention to the necessity of carrying Into
every department ot the Government a system
of rigid accountability, thorough retrenchment,
and wise economy. With no excep.
tional uor unusual expenditures, tbe oppres.
sive burdens of taxation can be lessened by
such a modification of our revenue laws as
will be consistent with tbe public faub, and
tbe legitimate and necessary wants of the
Government

Tbe report ot the Secretary ot War furnishes
valuable and important information in
reference to the operations of hi# I>epartment
(luring tbe past year. Few volunteers now
remain in tbe service, and they are beiug discharged
as r-tpidly as they can be replaced by
regular troops. Tbe army baa been promptly
paid, carefully provided with medical treatment.
well sheltered and subsisted, and is to
be lurnisbed with breech-loading small arm-?.
Tbe military strength of tbe nation ha? been
unimpaired by the discbarge of volunteers,
the disposition of unservicsable or perishable
stores, and the retrenchment ol expenditure.
Sufficient war material to meet any emergency
has been retained, and, irom tbe disbanded
volunteers standing ready to respond to tbe
national call, large armies can be rapidly organized,
equipped, and concentrated. Fortifications
on tne coast and frontier have received,
or are being prepared for more powerlul
armament-; lane surveys and harbor and
river improvements are in course of energetic
prosecution. Preparations have been made
tor the pn) ment of the additional bounties authorized
during the recent session of Congress,
under such regulations as will protect the
Government from fraud, and secure to the
hororably discharged soldier tbe well-earned
reward ot his faithfulness and gallantry.
More tbfin six thousand maimed soldiers have
re, e,vfd artiflcial limbs or Other surgical apparatus:
and forty-one national cemeteries,
containing the remains of 104.526 Union soldiers,
have already been established. The
to'ai estimate ot military appropriations is
<a*'5.2t>5.G6f?.
It is stated in tlie report of the Secretary of
the Navy that the naval force at this time
consist "of two hundred and seventy-eight
veo-Hs, armed with two thousand three hundred
and fltty-ore guns. Of these, one hundred
and fifteen vessels, carrying one thousand
and twenty-nine gnus, are id commission,
distributed ebVfiy among seven squadrons.
The number o? men in tbe service is thirteen
thousand vtx hundred. Great activity and
vigilance h?ve been displaced by all the
squadron?, and their movements have been
judiciously and efficiently arranged in such
manner as would he*t promote American commerce.
and protect the rights and interests of
our countrymen abroad. The vessels unemployed
are undergoing repairs, or are laid np
until their services may t.<- required. Moat of
tbe iron-c'ad fleet is at League Island, in the
vicinity of Philadelphia, a place which, until
decisive action -honId be taken by Congress,
was selected bv the Secretary of the Navy as
the most eligible location for that elass of
vessels. It is important that a suitable public
station should be provided for tbe iron-clad
fleet. It is intended that these vessels shall
be m proper condition for any emergency, and
if is desirable that the bill accepting League
Island lor naval purposes, which passed the
House of Representatives at its last session,
shonld receive final action at an early period,
in order that there may be a suitable public
s-ation for this class of vessels, as well as a
navy-vard ot areasafficient for the wants of
the service, on the Delaware river. Tbe
Naval Pension fund amounts to 911,750,000,
having been increased i2,750.<HJ0 during the
year. The expenditures of tbe Department
for the flsca' yetir ending 30th .lnne last were
(H3,:.*<24,524. and the estimates tor the coming
year amount to 923,80^,436. Attention is invited
to the condition of onr seamen, and the
importance of legislative measures for their
relief and improvement. The suggestions in
behalf ot this deserving class of onr fellowcitizens
are earnestly recommended to the favorable
attention of Congress.
Tbe report ot tbe Postmaster General presents
a most satisfactory condition of the postal
service, and submits recommendations which
deserve tbe consideration of Congress. The
revenues of the Department for the year eading
J une 3d, ls?<;, were ?14,38*,'W6, aud the expenditures
showing an excess of the
latter of tWtf,0S?. In anticipation of this deficiency,
however, a special appropriation was
made by Congress in the act approved July 2".
1,-tso. Including tbe standing appropriation of
S?UU,0Ui for free mail matter, as a legitimate
portion ot the revenues yet remaining unexpended.
the actual deficiency for the past year
is only 9vt>5,'i ;J?a sum within 951,141 of the
amoant estimated in tbe annual report of 1*04.
1 he decrease of raventie compared with the
previous year was one and one-tltth per cent.,
and the increase of expenditures, owing principally
to the enlargement ef the mail service
in the South, was twelve per cent. Ontberirh
ot June la.-t there were in operation six thousand
nine hundred and thirty mail rontes, with
an aggregate length of one hundred ana eighty
thousand nine hundred and twenty-one miles,
an aggregate annual transportation of seventyone
million eight hundred and thirty seven
thousand nine hundred and fourteen miles,
and an aggregate annual cost. Including all expenditures,
of 88,410,1.The length of railroad
rontes is thirty-two thousand and ninety,
two miles, and tbe aunnal transportation thirty
million six hundred and nine tbonsand four
hundred and sixty-seven miles. The length
of steamboat rontes is fourteen thoasand three
hundred and forty-aix miles, and the annual
transportation three million four hundred and
eleven tbonsand nine hundred aud sixty-two
miles. The mail service is rapidly increasing
throughontthe whole country, and its steady
extension in tbe Southern States indicates their
constantly improving conditio*. The growing
importance ot tbe foreign service also merits
attention. The Poat Office Department of Great
Britain and our own have agreed upon a preliminary
basia for a new Postal Convention,
which i' la believed will prove eminently beneficial
to the commercial interests of tbe United
States, inasmuch as it contemplates a reduction
ot tbe international letter poetage to oae-half
tbe exieting rates: a reduction of postage with
all other countries to and irom which corres
pendente is transmitted in the British mail, or
in closed mails through tbe United Kingdom;
tbe establish ment of uniform and reasonable
charges for tbe sea and territorial transit or
correspondence in closed mails- and an allowance
io-, each Post Office Department of the
right to nse ail mail communicanous established
tinder tbe authority of the other for tbe
dispatch of correspondence, either in opeu or
closed mails, on the same terms as those applicable
to tbe inhabitants of tbe country providing
tbe means of transmission.
The report of tbe Secretary of tbe Interior
exhibits the condition of those branches ot the
public service which are committed to bis supervision
During the last fiscal yetr, four million
six hundred and twenty-nine thoasand
three hundred and twe've acres of public land
were disposed of, one million eight hundred
and ninety-two thousand five hundred and
sixteen acres of which were entered under the
homestead act. Tbe policy origiually adopted
relative to tbe public lands has undergone essential
modifications. Immediate revenue,
and not their rapid settlement, was tbe cardinal
feature of Rur laud system Long experience
and earnest discussion have resulted in
tbe con viction that tbe early development of
our agricultural resources, and tbe diffusion
of an energetic population oyer our vast territory,
are objects of far greater Importance to
tbe national growth and prosperity than the
prodeeds of tbe sale of tbe land to tbe highest
bidder in opea market. Tbe pre-emption
laws confer npon the pioneer who complies
with tbe ternts they impose the privilege of
purchasing a limited portion of "nnoffered
lands" at tbe minimnm price. Tbe homestead
enactments relieve tbe settler from the paymen
tot purchase money, and secure him a
permanent borne, upon tbe condition of residence
for a term of years. This liberal policy
uiviteaemigration Irom the old, and from the
more crowded portions of tbe new world. Its
propitious results are undoubted, and will be
more signally manifested When time shall
have given to it a wider development.
Congress has made liberal grants of public
land to corporations, in aid of the construction
qt railroads and other internal improvements.
shonld this policy hereafter prevail, mora
stringent provisions will be required to secure
a laitbiul application of tbe fund. Tbe title
to the lands shonld not pas*, by pateut or
otherwise, but remain in the <tov?rnm*nt and
snbjtct to tta control until rcme portion of the
road has been actnally built. Portions of
them might then, from time totime.be conveyed
to the corporation, bnt never in agrea er
ratio to the whole quantity embraced by the
grant than tbe completed parts bear to the enfire
length of the projected improvement. This
restriction would notopergte to theprejndftce
of any undertaking conceived in good fail*
and assented with reasonable energy, ae it is
the settled practioe to withdraw from market
the lands falling Within toe operation ot such
grants, ond thus to exclude the inoeptien of a

Dunn* tbe last fiscal year the amount paid
?o pfinoBtn, including the expenses of dta.
bureement. was thirteen million lonr hundred
and fitty-nine thousand nine hundred and
ninety six dollars; and fifty thousand one hundred
ana seventy-seven names were added to
the pension rolls. The entire number of pensioners,
June 30, 1HW, was one hundred and
I twenty-tix thousand seven hundred and twenty.two.
This fact tarnishes melancholy and
striking proof of the sacr flees made to vindicate
the constitutional authority of the Federal
I Government, and to maintain inviolate the integrity
of tbe Union. They impose upon na
| corresponding obligations. It is estimated thai
thirty-three million dollars will be required to
I meet the exigencies of this branch of the serI
vice during the next fiscal year.
Tieaties have been concluded with the lnI
iiians who, enticed into armed opposition to
I onr Government at the outbreak of tbe rebellion.
have unconditionally submitted to our
authority, and manifested an earnest desire
J lor a renewal of friendly relations.
During tbe year ending September W, lt?>.
I eight tnontand seven hundred and sixteen patI

I As a subject upon which depends an immense
I amount of the preduction and commerce ot the
I country,1 recommend to Congress snch legislaI
tion as may be necessary for the preservation of
I the levees ot the Mississippi river It is a matter
I of national importance that early steps should
I betaken not only to add to the effieiencylof
I these barriers against destructive Inundations,
I but for tbe removal of all obstructions to the
I free and safe navigation of that great channel
| of trade and commerce.
Tbe District ol Columbia, under existing
I laws, is not entitled to that representation in
I the National Councils which, from oar earliest
I historv, has b? eu uniformly accorded to each
I Territory established trom time to time within
I our limits. It maintains peculiar relations to
Congress, to whom tbe Constitution ha? granted
tlie power of exercising exclusive legisla.
I lion over tbe seat of government. Onr fellowI
citizens residing in the District, whose interests
are thus confided to the special guardianship
I ot Congress, exceed in number the population
of several of our Territories, and no jnst reason
I is perceived why a delegate of their choice
should not be admitted to a seat in the House
I of Representatives. No mode seems so approI
priate and effectual ot enabling thern to make
I known their peculiar condition aad wanta, and
I of securing the local legislation adapted te
them. 1 therefore recommend the passage of a
I law authorizing the electors of the District of
Columbia to choose a delegate, to be allowed
the same rights and privileges as a delegate representing
a Terntorv. The Increasing enter.
prise and rapid progress ot improvement in
I the District are highly gratif ying and 1 trust
tbat tbe efforts of the municipal authorities to
I promote the prosperity of tbe national wetropI
oils will receive tbe efficient and generous cooperation
of Congress.

TI.e en*ire success of tbe Atlantic Telegraph
I between the coast of Ireland and tbe Province
I of Newfoundland, is an achie.veoj'M t which
ban been inaMy celebrated In both hemisphereI
as tbe opening of an era in the progresa of civI

I success will attend, and even greater re-ulta
I follow, tbe enterprise for connecting the two
I continents through the Pacific Ocean by
tbe projected line ol telegraph between KimI

ica.
! Tbe resolution of Congress protesting against
I pardons by foreign Governments of persons
I convicted of infamous offences, on condition of
I emu-ration to our country, has beeu cotnmnniI
rated to the States with which we maintain
intercourse, and the practice, so justly the subject
of complaint on our part, has not been reI
newed.

I Tbe Executive, warned of an attempt t>y
Spanish-American adventurers to induce the
I emigration of freedmen of the United States to I
I a foreign country, protected agauiat the pro- I
I ject as one which, if consummated, would re- I
I duee them to a bondage even more oppresaive ]
than that from which they bad juat been re- I
lieved. Assurance baa been received from the
I Government of the State in which the plan I
was matured, that the proceeding will meet I
neither ita encouragement nor approval, it I
ia a question worthy of your consideration, I
whether onr laws upon this subject are ade- I
I qnate to the prevention or punishment of the I
I crime thns meditated. j
i In the month of April last as Congress is I
aware, a friendly arrangement was made be- I
I tween the Emperor of France and the Presi. I
dent of tbe United States tor the withdrawal
from Mexico of the French expeditionary milnary
torces. This withdrawal waa to be effected
in three detachments, the flrat ot which,
it was understood, would leave Mexico in I
November, now paat, the aecond in March
next, and tbe third and last in November,
lf?r. Immediately upon the completion ol
tbe evacuation, tbe French Government wu
to assume the same attitude of non-interventicn,
in regard to Mexico, as ia held by the
Government of tbe United States. Repeated
assurances bave been given by \he Emperor,
since that agreement, that he would complete
the promised evacuation within tbe period
mentioned, or sooner.
It was reasonably expected that the proceed- I
ings thus contemplated would produce a crisis I
I of great political interest tn the Republic of
Mexico. Tbe newly-appointed Minister of tbe
United States, Mr. Campbell, wa* therefore
sent torward, on the 9th day of November last
to assume bis proper functions as Minister
Plenipotentiary of the United States to tbat I
Republic. It was also thought expedient tbat
be should be attended in the vicinity ot Mexi- I
co by the lieutenant General of the Army of
the United Siates, with tbe view of obtaining
sucb information as mtgbt be important to determine
the course to be pursued by the United
S*ates in te-estabiishing and maintaining nec- I
e-sarv and proper intercourse with theRepublie
of Mexico. Deeply interested in tbe cause I
of libei ty and humanity, it ?eemed an obvious I
duty on our part to exercise whatever influ- I
eiice we posi-eseed for the restoration and permanent
establishment in tbat country of a do
mestic and republican form of government.
Snch was the condition of affairs in regard to
Mexico, when, oa the 2-.M of November last, I
official information waa received from Paris
tbat the Emperor ot France had some time before
decided hot to withdraw a detachment of I
his force*, in the mouth ot November paat, ac- I
cording to engagement, but that this decision |
was made with the purpose of withdrawing 1
the whole of those.lorcea In tbe ensniug spring.
Of tbts determination, however, tbe United
Slates bad not received any notice or iutimation;
and, so soon as the information was re- I
ceivedbv the Government, care waa taken to
make known ita diaaent to the Emperor of I
France. |
1 cannot forego tbe hope tbat France wll
reconsider the subject, and adopt some reeoln- I
Uen in regard to the evacuation of Mexico
which will conform aa nearly as practicable
with the existing engagement, and thus meet I
tbe last expectations of tbe Uuited Statea. The I
papera relating to tbe aabject will be laid be- I
fore yen. It ia believed that, with the evacuation
of Mexico bv the expeditionary forces,
bo subject for aerioaa difference a between
France and tbe United Statea would remain.
Tbe expreasioaa of the Emperor aud people of
France warrant a hope that toe traditionary
friendship between the two countries might |
in that case be renewed aad permanently re- I
stored. I
A claim of a cittaea of the United 9tate? tor
indemnity for spoliations committed oa the
high aeaaVy the French authorities, in tbe ex- I
rciee of a belligerent jpower againet Mexico,
has been met by tbe Government of Franco
' with a preposition to defer settlement until a I
mutoal convention for the adjustment of all
cl atone of eiUzena nod subjects of both conn'
trice, arista* out ol the recent wan oa thia f
Continent, shall be ijrwd upon by the twt
coBBtrifi Tbe inffNtloB Is not flamed unreasonable,
bnt it belongs to Congress to direct
the manner in which claims for indemnity by
foreigners, m wall m by eitinaos of tbtl'Bitfd
States, arising out of ttoa lata civil war. shall
be adjudicated and determined. 1 have no
doubt that tbe subject of all such claims will
engage your attention at a convenient and
proper time.
It is a matter of regret that bo considerable
advance baa been made toward an adjustmeat
of tbe difference* between tbe United States
and Great Britain, arising oat o! the depredations
upon our national commerce and other
trespasses committed during our civil war by
British subjects, in violation of international
law and treaty obligations. Tne delay, bowever,
may be believed to bave resulted in no
small degree from tbe domes'ic situation of
Great Britain. An entire change of ministry
occurred in that country during tbe last session
ol Parliament. Tbe attention of tbe new
ministry was called to thesubjectat an early
day, and there is some reaaon to eapect that it
will now be cotsidered in a becoming and
Iriendly spirit. The Importance of an early
disposition of the question cannot be exaggerated.
Whatever might be the wishes of tbe
two Governments, it Is manifest that good
will and friendship between tbe two countries
cannot be established until a reciprocity, in tbe
practice of good-fsitb and neutrality, shall t?e
restcred between the respective nations.
On the 6tb of June last, in violauoo ot our
neutrality laws, a military expedition and enterprise
against the British North American
Colonies was projected and attempted to t*?
carried on vutbiu the territory and jurisdiction
Of tbe United States. In
obedience to the obligation imposed
upon the Executive by tbe Constitution, to
see that'he laws are faithfully executed, all
citizens were warned, by proclamation,against
taking part in or aiding such unlawful proceedings.
and the proper civil, military, and
naval officers were directed to take all necessary
measures lor the enlorcemeutof the laws.
The expedition tailed, but it has not been without
its painlul consequence*. Some of our
citi/ens who, it was alleged, wera engaged in
the expedition, were captured, and have been
brought to trial, as for a capital offence, in the
Province of Canada. Judgment and sentence
of death have been prououuced against some,
while others bave been acquitted. Fully believing
in the maxim of government, tba. severity
of civil punishment for misguided persons
who have engaged in revolutionary attempts
which have disastrously tailed, is unsound
and unwise, such representations bave
been made to tbe British Government, in behalf
of tbe cenvlcted persons, as. being sustained
by an enlightened and human* judgment.
will, it is hoped, induce in their cases an
exercise of clemency, and a judicious amnesty
to all who were engaged in tbe movement.
Counsel has been employed by the Government
to delend citixens ot tbe 1 sited State* on
trial lor capital offences m Canada, and a discontinuance
of the prosecutions which were
Instituted In tbe courts of the United States
against those who took part iu tbe expedition,
has been directed.
1 bave regarded the expedition as not only
political in its nature, but as also in a great
measure toretgn from the United States m its
causes, character, and objects. The attempt
w as understood to be made in sympathy witu
an insurgent party in Ireland, and. by striking
at a British Province on this Coutinent, was
designed to aid in braining redress for political
grievances which, it was as?umed. the
jeople of Ireland had suffered at the bands ol
the Writish Government during a period ol
several centuries The persons engaged in it
were chieOy natives of that country, some u
whom had, while others had not, become citizens
of the I nifd State* under our general
laws of naturalization. Complaints ol mngovernment
iu Ireland continually engage tUe
attention of the British nation, ana so great an
nt'itatiou is now prevailing in Ireland that the
British Government have de, med it ueeessarj
to suspend tbe wait of carpus in that
country. Ihese circumstances must necessarily
modify the opinion which we might
otherwise have entertained iu rejrard to an
expedition expressly prohibited by our neutrality
laws. So long as those laws remain
upon our statute-books, they should be fditulully
executed, and if tbey operate barsbly.
initially, or oppressively. Congress alone can
apply the remedy, by iheir modilic&uou ?r
repeal.
Political and commercial interests of the
1 uited Mates are not unlikely to be affected in
some degree by ev<enu which are transpirtug
in the eastern regions of Europe, and the time
seems to bave come wheu our Government
ought to have a proper diplomatic representation
in Greece.
This (lovernment has claimed for all persons
net convicted,or accused, or sus]?ected of
crime, an absolute political right of self-expatriauou.
and a choice of new national allegiance.
Mo?t of the European States have
dissented from this principle, and bave
claimed a right to bold such of their subjects
as have immigrated to aud been naturalized in
the United States, and afterwards returned on
transient visits to their native countries, to tbe
performance of military service in like manner
as resident subjects. Complaints arising
from the claim in thA respect made by foreign
States, have heretofore been matters of controversy
between the Uuitad States and some
of the European Powers, and the irritation
consequent upon the failure to settle
this question increased during the war
is which Prussia, italy, and Austria were recently
engaged. While Great Britain has
never ackuowledged the right of expatriation,
sbe has not for some years past practically insisted
upon the opposite dec trine. Prance
has been equally forbearing, and Prussia has
proposed a compromise, which, althongh
evincing increased liberality, has not been accepted
by tbe United States. Peace is now
prevailing everywhere in Europe, and the
present seems to be a favorable time for an assertion
by Congress of tbe principle, so long
maintained by the Executive Department, that
naturalization by one State lolly exempts the
native-born subject of any other State from the
performance ot military service under any foreign
Government, so long as he does not voluntarilv
renounce iu rights aud benefits.
In the performance of a duty imposed upon
roe by the Constitution, I bave thus submitted
to the Representatives of the States and of tne
People such information of our domestic aud
foreign affairs as the public interests seem to
require. Our Government is now undergoing
its mofct Irving ordeal, and my earnest prayer
is. that the peril may be successfully aud
luially passed, without impairing its original
strength and symmetry. The interests dT the
nation are best to be promoted by the revival
of fraternal relations, the complete
obliteration ol our patt differences, and
the re-inauguration ol all the pursuits of peace.
Directing our efforts to the early accomplishment
of these great ends, let us endeavor to
preserve haimony betwteu the co-ordinate
Departments of the Government that each in
its proper sphere may cordially co-operate
with tbe other In securing tbe maintenance ol
tbe Consuiution. the preservation of the Cuion,
and the perpetuity of onr iree institutions.
