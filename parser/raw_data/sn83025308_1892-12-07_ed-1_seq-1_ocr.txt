Ta - Touched Upon
Very Ightly.
WAsIamroTN, Dec. 6.-President Harrl
son's annual message was sent to congress '
to-day. It reads as follows:
To the tenate and House of Representatives.
In submitting my annual message to con
gress I have great satisfaction in being able i
to say that general conditions affeoting the (
commercial and industrial interests of the '
United States are in the highest degree fa
vorable. A comparison of the existing t
conditions with those of the most favored I
period in the history of the country will
itself show that such a degree of prosperity
and so general a diffusion of the comforts
of life were never before enjoyed by our
people. The total wealth of our country in 1
1860 was $16,159,616,068. In O890it amounted
to $62,610,000,000, an increase of 887 per
cent. The total mileage of railways in the
United States in 1860 was 80,626. In 1890 it
was 187,741, an increase of 448 per cent, and
it is estimated that there will be about 4,000
miles of track added by the close of the
year 1892. The official returns of the
eleventh census and those of the tenth, for
seventy-five leading cities, furnish the
basis for the following comparison: In
1880 the capital invested in manufacturing
was $1.232,889,670. In 1890 the capital in
vested in manufacturing was $2,900,735,
884. In 1880 the number of employee was
1,301,888. In 1890 the number of em
ployes was 7,271,184. In 1880 the wages
earned were $501,965,778. In 1890 the wages
earned were $1,221,170,454. In 1880 the
value of the product was $2.711,579,999. In
1890 the value of the product was $4,860,
286,837.
I am informed by the superintendent of
the census that the omission of certain in
dustries in 1880, which were included in
1890, accounts in part for the remakable in
crease thus shown. But after making full
allowances for differences of method, and
deducting the returns for all industries not
included in the census of 1880, there re
main in the reports from these seventy
five cities an increase in the capital

the prodnct of $2,0'24,23.166, in the wages
earned of $(77.944,9291 , and in the number
of wage earnirs employed of 85(;,029. The
wage earnings not only show an increnh.ed
aggregate. but an increase per capita from
$.8; in 1880 to $545 in 1809, or 41.71 per
cmnt.

of existing plaunits 180. 'rhe new capital in
vested atmounts to 440,449.050, and the num
ber of anditional employes to 37.285. The
Textile Wo,ld for July. 1892, states that
during the first six months of the present
calendar year 135 now factories were built,
of which tloty are cotton mills, forty-eight
knittine mills, twenty-six woolen mills, fif
teen silk mills, forty plush mills, and two
linen moills. Of the forty cotton mills
twenty-one have been built in the southern
states. Mr. A. i. Shepperdaou, of the New
York Cotton exchange, estimates the num
ber of working spindles in the United
States on Salpt. 1, 1892, at 185,00000, ani iti
crease of 61;0.,000 over the year 1891.
The conisumption of cotton by American
nmills in I8tl was 2,396.000 bheIsr and in 1832
2,584.000 tales., an iucoease of 188,000 bales.
Fromn 186(;9 to 1092 inclusive there has been
ain incrl'Ase in his consumption of cotton in
Eurote of 2 iper cent, while during the
sanes period the incroeso of condsuu.ption in
the United btatest has ben about 11 per
cent. .lho re; ort of Ira Ayor, speciatl agent
of the trensury derlrtmrnout, shows that at
the date Sept. 30, 10, 92, there were thirty
two companies manufacturing tin and tin
plate in the United States and fourteeun
companies building now works for uch
manufacture. The estimates of invest
ments in buildings at the c;ose of the fiscal
year June .0, 18.2), if existing conditions
were to be counted, was $5,00t,000. and the
estimated rate of production 2l00,tt,0(0)
pounds per annoum. The actual production
for tile quarter enling Sapt. t0, 1892, was
10,152,725 pounds. The report of
the labor commisaioner of New
York shows that during the year
1891, in about 6,000 manufacturing estatb
lslhmnents in that state, embraoed within
the special inquniry made by him, and roil
resentiig sixtv-seven dtfferent Industries,.
there wais a net increase over the year 181t)
of $31,l15.1:30.(8 iin the value of the product
and of 66,3117,J925,1J in the amuount of wages
paid. The reeort of the corulmmissioner of

of 7,3!; in the number of persons employed
in the sanme period.
tDuriu.g the last six months of the year
1891 nad the first six months of 18142 the
totl productlioo tf pig iron was 9,71t1,81t
tuns, as anuinst t'.2.0.703: tons in the year
1890. which was the largest atnnual pro
doutinn sver obtained for the same months.
In 1891-1. 2 tlte rirolduotioln of iessenrer
ingots was :3.878.81 tons, an increase of
181,710 lttgrs inue over the provuslrAl un
precedented yearly produdtion of 3,t~i,871l
gross tuns in 18911. The production of Ihse-
mir steel rails fort he irst six months of
1802 was 772,4806 gross tons, as against 802,- or
080 gross tons during the last six months of of
the year of 1891, et
The total value of oour foreign trade (es- pl
ports and manufactures) during the last of
fiscal year was $1,857,680,610, an increase of in
$126,26,604 over the previous fiscal year. t
The average annual value of our imports bs
and exports of merchandise for the ten in
fiscal years prior to 1891 was $1,457,822,019. at
It will be observed that our foreign trade ti
for 1892 exceeded this annual average value
by $400,388,891, an inorease of 27.47 per pi
cent.
The significance and value of this in- go
crease are shown by the fact that the pi
excess in the trade of 1802 over 1891 wast
wholly in the value of exports, for there t
was a decrease in the value of imports of cc
$17,518,254. The value of our exports during vy
the fiscal year 1892 reached the highest fig- ae
are in the history of the government, d
amounting to $1,030,278,148. exceeding by oe
$14,797,888 the exports of 1891, and exoeed- ft
ing the value of the imports by $202,875,,86. II
A comnnrison of the value of our exports w
for 1892, with the annual average for the ti
ten years prior to 1891 shows an excess of a
$260,142,671, or of 34.15 per cent. The value is
of our imports of merchandise for 18924 ti
which was $829,402,462, also exceeded the ti
annual average value of the ten years prior w
to 1891 by 1885,215,940. p
During the tiscal year 1892 the value of a
imports free of duty amounted to $457,999,. Ii
658, the largest aggregate in the history of o
commerce. The value of imports of mer- ii
chandise entered free of duty in 1892 was p
55,85 per cent of the total value of imports, so
as compared with 43.35 per cent in 1891, and ti
88.66 per cent in 1890. g
In our coastwise trade, a most encourag- co
ing development is in progress, there hav- ti
ing been in the last four years an increase ii
of 10 per cent in internal commerce. The A
statistics show that no such period of pros- u
perity has ever before existed. The freight r,
carried in the coastwise trade of the great ti
lakes in 1890 aggregated 28,295,950 tons. On o
the Mississippi. Missouri and Ohio rivers n
and tributaries in the same year the ,traffio ti
aggregated 29,404.406 tons, and the tqtal a
vessel tonnage passing through the Detroit b
river during that year was 21,684,000 tons. o
The vessel tonnage entered and a
cleared in the , foreign trade of t
London during 1890 amounted to d
13,480,767 tons and of Liverpool to 10,941,- a
800 tons, a total for these two great snip- 'J
ping ports of 24,442,568 tons, only slightly ii
in excess of the vessel tonnage passing a
through the Detroit river, and it should be a
said that the season for the Detroit river
was but 228 days, while of course in London
and Liverpool the season was for the en
tire year. The vessel tonnage passing
through the St. Marie canal for the fiscal e
year 1892 amounted to 9,828,874 tons and
the freight tonnage of the Detroit river is
estimated for that year at 21,000,000 tons, r
against 23,209,619 tons in 1891. t
The aggregate traffion one or railroads for a
the year 1891 amounted to 704,398,609 tons r
of freight, compared with 691,644,437 tons
in 1890. an increase of 13,054,172 tons.
Another indication of the general pros- t
perity of the country is found in the fact
that the number of depositors in savings a
banks increased from 693,870 in 1860 to i
4,328,393 in 1890. and the amount of depos- t
its from $194,277.375 in 18(0 to f
$1,524,844,503 in 1890. In 1891 the I
amount of denosits in savings banks N
was $1,623,079,749. It is estimated
that 90 per cent of these deposits represent s
the savings of wage earners. The bank t
clearances has, for the nine months ending
Sept. 30, 1861, amounted to $41,049,890,808.
For the same months in 1892 they amounted
to $45,189,601,947, an excess for the nine
months of $4,140.211,139.
There never has been a time in our his- 1
tory when work was so abundant or when
wages were so high, whether measured by
the currency in which they are paid or by
their power to supply the necessaries and
comforts of life. It is true that the mar- t
ket prices of cotton and wheat have been I
low. It is one of the unfavorable inoidenta 1
of agriculture that the farmer cannot pro
duce upon orders. He must sow and reap
in igno ance of the aggregate production c
of the year, and is peculiarly subject to the J
depressions which follow over-production.,
lint while the fact I have stated is t:ue as
to the crops I have mentioned, the general
average of prices has been such as to give
to agrioulture a fair participation in gIn
oral prosperity. The value of our total i
farm products has increased from $1.363,
646.866 in 18160 to $4.500,000,000 in 1891, as
estimated by statisticians, an inorease of i
230 per cent. The number of hogs January l
1. 1891, was 50,525,106, and their value
$210,193,925. On January 1, 1892, the nom
ber was 52,898,019, and their value $241,
931,415. On January 1, 1891, the number of
cattle was 36,875,648, and the value $544,- 1
127.908. On January 1, 1892, the nunmber
was 37,651,239, and their value $570,749,155.
The Tariff.
If any are discontented with their state
here, if any believe that the wages or prices,
the return for honest toil, are inadequate.
they should not fail to remember that there
Sis no other country in.the world where the
conditions that seem to them hard would
not be accepted as highly prosperous. I
believe that the protective system which
now for something like thirty years has I
prevailed in our legislation has been a
mighty instrument for the development of
r our national wealth and a most powerful
r agency in protecting the homes of our
workingmen from the invasion of want. I
have felt a most solicitous interest to pre
serve to our working people rates of wages
I that would not only give daily bread, but
E supply a comfortable margin for those
home attractions and family comforts and
enjoyments, without which life is neither
hopeful nor sweet. It is not my purpose to
renew hero the crguurment in favor of a pro
i tectivo tariff. The result of the rooent
i election must be accepted as having intro
duced a now policy. VWe must assume
that the present tariff, constructed upon
I the lines of protection, is to be repealed,
and that there is to be substituted for it a
tariff law constructed solely for revenue;
that no duty is to be higher brcause the in
crease will keep open an AImerican mill or
keep up the wnages of an American work
rnrunruln, bat that in every case suech a rate
Sof duty is to be imposed as will bring tihe
Streasucry of the hnlated Statoe the Inrgest
Sreturuns ,f revenue. Tihe contention has
rnot bIeo~ between schedules, but betweenI
Sprinrirles. and it would be offensive to suu
I gest that thr prevailing party will not carry
into legislation the prlneiples advocated hy
Sit. aud the pledges given to the people.
SThe tariff bills passed by the house
Sof representatives at the last
session were, as I sunpposed,
I even in opinion of their
Sp.omoters, inadequate and justified only
hby the facot that the senate and house of
r) representatives were not in accord and that
a rieneral revision could not, therefore, be
Sundertaktrn. 1 recommend that the whole
I subject of tariff revision be left to the iu
coming congresas. It is a matter of regret
r that this work runes be delayed for at learst
- three months, for the threat of great tarilf
changes introduced so nmuch uncertainity
- that an arount not easily estimatyd, of
business inaction and of diminrherd prr
Sduction will nocesarily result. It is prossi
Sble also lhat this uncertainty may result in
a decreread revenues from custom duties, for
Sour mrerohauts will make cautionue orders
for foreign goods in view of the prospect
i of trriff reductions and the uncrsltainty as
to when it will take effect.
S Tihose who have advocated a protective
a tariff can well afford to have their diaes
1 trous forecasts of a change of rpolicy disap
Spointed. If a system of suatoms rules can
be framed that will set thire idle wheels
r and looms of Europe inr motion snd crowd
a nour warehouses with foreign-made goods.
I and at the same time keep our own mills
r busy; that will give us an incrasseod ipar
ticiration in the "tuarkets of the worbl,"
of a greater varlue than the horns mnrket
r that we surrender; that will give inuoresed
Iwork to foreignl works upon piroducts ti be
rconrsumed Ir y our leopnl,. without dimlnm
I ishintig the nimoount of work to be done here;
- that will enable the Ameraloarn manrlrrct
Surer to pay his workmenn from 50 to 1(O) tre I
oent more in wages than is paid at the for
eign mill, and yet to compete in our mark
ets and foreign markets with the foreign
producer; that will further reduce the cost
of articles of wear and food without redue
inag the wages of those who prodnoe them:
that can be celebrated after its effects have
been realized as its expectation has been,
in Europe as well as Amnerican clties, the
authors and promoters of it will be en
titled to the highest praise.
We have had in our history several ex
periments of the contrasted effects of a
revenue and a protective tariff, but this
generation has not felt them, and the ex
perience of one generation is not highly
instructive to the next. The friends of
the protective system, with undiminished
coundence in the principles they have ad
vocated, will wait the results of the new
experiment. The strained and too often
disturbed relations existing between the
employes and employers in our great mana
facturing establishments have not been
favorable to a calm consideration by the
wage earners of the effect upon wages of
the protective system. The facts that his
wages were the highest paid in a like call
idg in the world and that a maintenance of
this rate of wages in the absence of pro
tective duties upon the product of his labor
was impossible, were obscured by the
passion evoked by these contests. lHe may
now be able to review the question in the
tight of his personal experience under the
operation of a tariff for revenue only. If
that experience shall demonstrate that the
present rates of wages are thereby main
tained or assured, either absolutely or in
their purchasing power, and that the aggre
gate volume of work to be done in this
country is increased or even maintained,
that there are more or as many days work
in a year at as good or better wages as the
American workman, as has been the case
under the protective system, every one will
Sejoice. A gene:al process of wage redua
tion cannot be contemplated by any patri
otic citizen without grave apprehension. It
I may be, indeed I believe it is, possible for
I the American manufacturer to compete snoe
I cesafolly with his foreign rival in many
I branches of production without the defense
of protective duties, if the pay rolls are
equalized, but the conflict that stands he
tween the producer and that result and the
distress of our workingmen, when it is
attained, are not pleasant to contemplate.
The society of the unemployed, now holding
its frequent and threatening parades in the
t streets of foreign cities, would niot be al
e lowed to acquire an American domicile..
Work of the Administration.
r The reports of the hpads of the several
I executle departments, which are herewith
submitted, have very naturally included a
resume of the whole work of the administra
tion. The attention not only of congress, but
of the whole country is again invited to the
a methods of administration which have been
m pursued, and to the results which have
been attained. Public revenues amounting
to $1,414.079,292.28 have been collected and
t disbursed without loss from misappropria
tion, without a single defalcation of snuch
importance as to attract the public atten
tion, and at a diminished per cent of cost
r for collection. The public business has
a been transacted not only with fidelity, but
I with a view to giving to the people in the
I fullest possible degree the benefits of the
t service established and maintained for
C their protection and comfort.
1 Our relations with other nations are now
undisturbed by any serious controversy.
The -omplicated and threatening differ
5 eA~crn vr., * erman'y and England relating
to the Samoan affairs, with England in re
lation to the seal fisheries in the Bering
i sea, and with Chili growing of the Balti
1 more affair, have been adjusted.
These have been negotiated and con
cluded under section three, of the tariff law
commercial agreements relating to reci
I procity trade with the following countries:
i Bazil, ban Domingo Republic, Spain for
Cuba and Puerto Rico, Guatemala. Salva
dor, the German empire, Great Britain for
certain West Indian colonies, and
e British Guinea, Nicaragua, Honduras
Sand Austria-Hungary. Of these those with
s Guatemala. Salvador, the German empire,
1 Great Britain, Nicaragua, Honduras. and
Austria-Hungary, have been concluded
since my last annual message. The total
I increase in value of exports to all the coin
tries with which we hove reciprocity agree
s ments has been $20,572,671. This increase
f is chiefly in wheat, flour, meat and dairy
Y products and manufactures of iron steel
a and lumber. There has been a large in
- crease in the value of imports from all these
- countries since the commercial agreements
f went into effect, amounting to $74,294,525,
- but it has been entirely in imports from the
r American countries, consisting mostly of
* sugar, coffee, india rubber and crude drugs.
Nicaragua Canal.
S I repeat with great earnestness the roo
ommendation which I have made in
r previous messages as to the inadequate
Â° support given the American company en
e gaged in the construction of the Nicaragua
ship canal. It is impossible to overstate
the value from every standpoint of this
a great enterprise and I hope that there may
be time given in this congiess to give to it
f an impetus that will insure the early com
I pletion of the canal and secure to the
r United States its proper relations to it
when completed.
SThe Brussrels Conference.
it The congress has been already advised
a that the invitations of this goves nment for
d the assembling of an international mono
r tare conference, to consider the question of
an enlargedl use of silver, was accepted by
t tho nations to which they were issued.
- The conference assembled at Brussels on
a Nov. 22. and has entered upon the consider
it ation of this great question. I have not
I. doubted, and have taken occasion to ex
a iress that belief, as well in the Iivitations
issued for the conference as in my public
m- tessages, that the free coinage of silver
r upon ian rgreed international raltio, would
- probably priomoto the interest of our pco
e ile in clquality with those of other nations.
e It is too early to predict what results may
It be accomplisvhed iby the conference. if
a on temporary check or dleoliny intervenes I
n believe that very soon commercial condi
r- tions will compel tihe now reluctant goy
v ernments to unite with us in this move
y ment to secure the enlargement of the vol
n. ume of money needed for the transaction
Io of the business of the world.

ONE PLAN W HNITDRWN.,
The Proposal by Rothschild not in
Favor at the Brussels Con- 1
ference. I"
Sir O. Rivors Wilson Voicos the t
Opposition of England to
Silver.
Mr. MlcCreary Outlines the JPsitlo oo ti
the United States on the i
Questiont,
BIUesRELs, Dec. G.-The International
Monetary conference to-day resumed the i
discussion of Rothschild's plans. Sir C.
!Rivers Wilson, who said his views were
shared in by Sir Charles Ireamentle, the
other British delegate, said he believed all
the governments who sent delegates hero
recognized the presence of a great danger.
"A note of warning has reached ous from
America," he said, "and. to say the least,
it is doubtful whether the American gov
ernment can continue indefinitely' the gi
gantio efforts it has fruitlessly made for so
many years, to maintain and raise the price
of silver. We needn't inquire whether the
policy which governed currency legislation
in the great republic was wise in con
ception, but it cannot be denied it
has not realized expectations and is greatly
the cause of our present position. In
any case the suspension of American silver
purchases has become the practical ques
tion of the day, and if it occurred might
lead to the suspension of coinage in India.
Certain high authorities believe the sudden
cessation of the purchases of silver by
America and the closing of India's mints
would lead to heavy falls of silver and dis
astrous disturbance to commerce. Others
contend that the fall has already been
grleatly discounted and the removal of the
present uncertainty will have a quieting
effect. Sir Charles Freemantle and myself,
I'l1 state frankly, are pure mono-metallists,
and do not admit that any other system
than a single gold standard is applicable in
Great Britain. We will admit that the
Rothschild and Levi plans will not be In
compatible with our principles, but it is
not enough that these schemes are de
fensible in principle. Would either
plan have the least chance of meeting with
a preponderance of support that would just
ify us in recommending that the British
government consider it? We think not.
Another plan may, however, be formulated
and approved by the conference, and if It
does not confilict with our rrinciples it will
receive serious consideration from the Brit
ish government."
Mr. McCreary, of the American delega
tion, proceeded to point out the diffculties
and perils existinic in the situation, and
said whatever the cause, the fact remained
thata remedy was imperatively necessary.
He appreciated the attention iothechild
had given the conference, but could not
support his plan. He coalt not admit that
it was a proper remedy for America to con
tinue the purchase of fifty-four millions of
Sounces of silver annually at a price not to
exceed 100 cents on the dollar, on condition
that the European powers make purchases
yearly to amount to Â£5,000,000 for live
years, at a price not to exceed
forty-three pence per ounce; and if silver
should rise above that price that the pur
chases be immediately suspended. "It
seems an unequnal distribution that we he
expected to purchase twice as much silver
as Europe," he said. "The object of the
conference should be not to fix a price
which will keep silver below par, but to
enlarge its use and restore it to a parity
with the value it had with gold Irior to
1873." Mr. McCreary referred to the com
plants of the British chambers of rcom
merce, quoted the recent declarations of
Archbishop Walsh and Mr. Balfour, and
contended that the situation demanded a
broader recognition and better remedy
than that suggested by Rothschild. The
American delegates were ready to
operate with other delegates in a
candid and determined effort to
maintain the monetary function
of both metale. 'Therefore after submitting
a general plan for bi-metallism favored by
America, they also submitted a plan fi
vored by themselves. It was a ulain busi
Stres proposal and if adopted the necessary
a details could be easily arranged. It an
nounces no new theory and proposes no un
a tried system. It only opened a way to a
return of a time tried and time honored sys
t tem under which Cold and silver were for
many years at par, and equal instruments
in exchange. Acts of parliament, laws of
t congress and edicts of monarche had
changed the lent value of the metals. In
order that thie situation in theUnited States
be fully underatool, Mr. McCreary
explained the position of the dit
ferent political tarties and added
r that he believed the people in general,
- without regard to political affiliation, en
f dorsed the American plan. Referring to
the silver bullion law, ihe said the law was
not entirely satisfactory to either party,

alluded to the oresident's late bereavement.
ItrJyner introduced a bill for the better
protection of commerce and to establish a
national quarantino. Referred. The mes
seUnger from the White house then ap
pen ed with the president's message, which
the clerk at once began to read. The read
ing of the nrieseage net with little attention,
rulnny nienlbers left tire hall, prefering to
study the iecornlrundatious of the presi
dent at their leisure at holrnI. 'Those who
remainied entered into conversation or de
voted themlselves to the perusal of news
I papers. At the conclusion of the reading
thl, message wais referred to the committes

Warwick, of Ohibo. was announced and as a
Imark of respect the house adjourned.
In the senate, as soon as the secretary
finished reading the journal, a messenger
hended him the president's message, which
lie proceeded to read. 'The commercial
arid huslness statistics given in the first
vart of the message and the sarcastio para
graphs as to the supporsed effect of tariff for
revenue only seemed to meet with general
anproval on the republican side of .tbhe
chamber. It attracted little attention on
the other side. l)uring the reading the
democratic senators for the most part were
chatting listlensly with each other or at.
tending to correspondence, while the repub
lionn senators paid the president the com
pllment of giving the document their undi
vided attention. Various other subjects
discussed in the message. bow
ever, seemred to have vey little
interest for the senators on either side.
ThI democrats made no nietense of listen
ing and the attentionl of the republicans
showed a marked falling off. The seats in
the diplomatic gallery were occupied
throughout the reading of the message by
the hpanish minister and the first secre
tnris a of the German and Russian lega
tions.
At the conolosion of the reading of the
message, Vest offered a resolution for ref
erence, reciting the pernicious activity of
the census bureau in the recent election
and proposing an investigation. It will be
called no for action to-morrow.

resolution., which he said he would call up
to-morrow, for appointment by the preasi
dent of three commissioners to confer with
the proper authorities of the five civilized
tribes of Indian territory with a view to
- making such agreement and arrangement
as would induce them to take homesteads
in severalty and sell the remainder of the

day in a bill introduced by Otis, of Kansas,
having the voluminous title: "To change
our monetary systemr, to reduce interest, fix

amount of paper money not to exceed in
volume l0 of the assessed value of seal
a estate in the United States as shown in the
Y last census, to be held in the gene'al trers
e ury as a "stlites improvement fund,"
0 and only to be paid out ron the order of the
