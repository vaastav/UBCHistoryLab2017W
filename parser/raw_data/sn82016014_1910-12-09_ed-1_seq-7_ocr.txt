BRISTOW INSPIRED JOHNSON.
Election of California Governor At
tributed to Kansan's Lesson.
Washington, Dec. 9. Senator Bris
tow of Kansas was. to a degree at
least, responsible for the overturn in
California this year by which for the
first time the power of the Southern
Pacific railroad was shaken. Hiram
Johnson, governor-elect, called on the
Kansas senator to thank him. A stocky,
keen looking, determined man with
glasses Is the governor-elect, very
much in earnest, gesturing as he talks.
"I learned from Senator Bristow,"
Governor Johnson said, "How to get
to the people. California had simply
been an appendage to the Southern
Pacific for many years People gen
erally didn't suppose that I could make
a dent- In the system. But I told them
that I would do what Bristow had
done. I would make my campaign from
the street corners to the people. So I
started in months before the primary.
I talked In front of grocery stores
anywhere I could get a hearing.
"Then I could telephone ahead to a
blacksmith's shop and tell them I was
coming, and there would be a crowd
waiting when I got there. Before the
end of the campaign they used to dis
miss school when I came to town and
everybody would turn out to meet
ings. The Southern Pacific people
sneered at us at first. They said our
campaign would blow up in two weeks.
They kept on putting oC the two
weeks until pretty near the end when
they really got scared."
Johnson's campaign was made
against bitter opposition. The Cali
fornia senators belong to the organiza
tion crowd and the federal office hold
ers worked against the Johnson ticket
up to the election, when the stand
patters bolted the ticket as they did in
Kansas.
MRS. M'HESRY TO SUE HOWARD
Will Ask Damages Charging False Im
prisonment. Wichita, Kan.. Dec. 9. Mrs. Myra
McHenry is having a damage suit pre
pared against the city of Howard,
Kan., on account of alleged false im
prisonment. Mrs. McHenry arrived In
Wichita from eastern Kansas She said
that she was released from jail at How
ard last Friday.
"I have been 'bringing In the
sheaves' while away," she said. "This
thing of arresting an elderly woman
like myself every time I make a speech
attacking a public official that needs
showing up has got to stop."
Mrs. McHenry stated that Judge
Bulger of Cherokee probably would be
her attorney. Her plan is to start the
action In Howard and then have it re
moved to some other county where
there is less liability of prejudice.
"They arrested me," she continued,
"wtihout a complaint charging me
with disturbing the peace of anyone.
The complaint merely rtated that I
disturbed the peace of the city of How
ard. When the judge called my case
I stood up In court and offered a pray
er. One of the witnesses was not a
believer In God and could not be
sworn. The judge was deaf and didn't
hear half what was said.
"I was released from Jail because
the city didn't want to provide me with
warm clothing. In order to keep
warm I had to wear clothing belonging
to the sheriff."
Thursday after election Mrs. Mc
Henry was arrested at Howard while
talking to John Marshall and others.
SOLDIERS DISCUSS MESSAGE.
Find "Army" Clauses Recommend
Present Number of Troops.
Fort Leavenworth. Kan., Dec. 9.
The part of President Taft's message
dealing with the army came in for
close attention of the officers here. The
recommending of the passage of bills
Increasing the number of officers meets
with favor. The detailing of officers
for college, national guard and other
special services has left a shortage for
duty with troops. With the recom
mendation of the president It is felt
that the bill pending to Increase the
engineer corps by sixty additional of

of the message Indicates that the size
of the regular army will be kept about
as It is at present.

GETS A NOBLE MASTERPIECE.
Wtchltan Pays $1,500 for Painting of
Moonlight Scene.
Wichita, Kan., Dec. 9. Col. Sam B.
Amidon has received a resplendent
masterpiece of Wichita genius. It is
the production of the brains and hands
of John Noble, formerly a Wichita
boy, who has studied in Paris, and
whose world famed productions are
hung in "Des Salon Universitie Inter
nationale Des Beaux-Arts et Lettres,
Paris, 4911."
This explains in French the picture
that Colonel Amidon has on an easel
at his home, the purchase while on
his tour of Europe last summer of
one of the three masterpieces of John
Noble, now a recognized genius in the
Latin Quarter of the Parisian capital.
At the last hanging of the art speci
mens in the Grand Salon of Paris there
were submitted 13,000 subjects. Of
these, there were 1,100 hung: of tb.es.
there were three from the handicraft
of John Noble, a Wichita boy. wOne
was the "Clair de Lume." numbered
1030, and sold to CoL Sam B. Amidon.
No. 1032, "Moulin," and No. 1031,
"Pont Croix," were also hung In the
same Grand Salon. The masterpiece
that Colonel Amidon purchased is a
moonlight scene on the tempestuous
coast of Normandy. It is a scene in
still life. John Noble sat up 40 nights
with the patience of a saint waiting
for the auspicious moment when the
right reflection would strike the water.
He was three months working patient
ly on this work. The Paris papers
were eloquent in their praise of this
still scene, and telegrams have been
received by Colonel Antidon to hold
his picture in America that It might
be exhibited in New York before be
ing sent to Wichita. Colonel Amidon
refused all overtures, and had it sent
directly io Wichita.
Colonel Amidon paid $1, 500 for the
picture in Itself and the frame is worth
$175 more, as it is a guaranteed Louis
XIV frame, a few of the many his
toric frames now hanging about can
vases of that ancient period.
MORSE'S COLLECTION TO K. V.
Prehistoric Fossils Will Be Taken
From Iola at Once.
Iola, Kan., Dec. 9. Professor Mar
tin of Kansas university came here tq
take charge of the fossil collection of
Travis Mnrsa. the latter having recent
ly offered the collection to the univer
sity. Mr. Morse's collection represents
25 years of work and is valuable, con
taining some rare specimens.
Most of the fossils were collected by
Mr: Morse when he resided in Scott
City, before coming to Iola, but sev
eral good specimens have been ob
tained by him from the quarry of the
Iola Portland. The collection filled a
case fully seven feet long and con
tained such rare fossils as mastodon
teeth, and wings of the gigantic pre
historic bats.
Professor Martin says one of the
rarest specimens in the collection is a
fish jaw with all the processes com
plete. Prehistoric fish jaws are fre
quently found, but it is a rare thing
that they have the processes com

Heart Trouble I5rousrht On by Taking
Too Much Electricity.
Wichita, Kan., Dec 9. Glenn
Cross, a Wichita boy, who was in his
senior year at the University of Kan
sas in Lawrence, is- dead at the home
of his parents, Mr. and Mrs. Byron
Cross, 1537 North Etnporia avenue.
Glenn Cross had suffered from a
weak heart since a child. He was tak
en ill in Lawrence several weeks ago,
but did not give up his studies and re
turn home until two weeks ago. He
would have been 23 years old next
month. He was born in Topeka, but
was reared in Wichita, attending the
grade schools and the high school
here.
It is said that close application to
electrical experiments in the electrical
laboratories at the state university was
responsible for the weakened condition
of Mr. Cross. He as always In touch
more or less with electrical currents,
and It is thought that this close asso
ciation undermined his system. He
was working unusually hard in the
electrical laboratory at the state uni
versity when taken 111 several weeks
ago.

PLATED BALL 48 TEARS AGO.
Ottawan Tells of Game With Cannons
in Arkansas
Ottawa, Kan.. Dec 9. "It was Just
48 years ago this very minute." said
H. B. F. Kellar this afternoon, "that
we were playing ball at Prairie Grove,
Ark., in one of the hardest battles of
the Civil war."
"The battle started in the morning
and lasted until a half hour after
dark, when an armistice was de
clared," remarked Mr, Kellar, "and we
went into camp for the night. We
had 7,400 men in our army and were
opposed by 28,000 Confederates. The
enemy literally cut us to pieces in the
battle and had us whipped to death
when the armistice was declared. For
some reason, during the night the Con
federates wrapped blankets around the
artillery wheels and marched away.
We did- not know it was gone until we
attempted to attack them on the fol
lowing day, and after , marching
through a corn field found that the
only Confederates who remained were
those left to bury the dead. This left
us in charge of the situation and mas
ter of the day."
Mr. Kellar remembers that battle at
Prarie Grove well, as it was in that en
gagement that he was shot through
the leg. He was in. the First Kansas
battery. ,
