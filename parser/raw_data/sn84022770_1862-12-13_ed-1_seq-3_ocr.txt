The gist of the debate was as to whether the

we in us t pronounce his forensic eloquence of no

explanation ol' the manner in which wo wero
enabled to i?suo the President's Message
as roon as it was received by mail, was given
by a gentleman nt tho Washington Hotel last
evening, which our known modesty almost
prevents tis from publishing. The gentleman
accounted for it in this manner: "You BUO
Murpliy is a diiving chap, [ahem!] and rt-cived
a copy of the messngo by the steamer Emily
Harris by way of Victoria j he hurried it into

HONOR TO WHOM HONOR IS DL'K.—Mr.
llolbrouk acknowledges in the Orcgoniun that
over SI,OOO of the $17,000 published as con
tributed to the Sanitary Fund in Oregon,
should have been accredited to Washington
Territory. This would increase our list,
with the contribution of Walla Walla—sl,-
000 gold bar—to about 811,000, and decrease
tho Oregon Fund to about 616,000. We

The Medical and Surgical Institute
Of Dr. L. J. CZAPKAY, is already secured in a
position Which places it, ns well ns its proprietor,
far above the assaults of envy am! professional
malice. In the schools of France, the highest
prizes are often awarded to practitioners in this
department of medical science, and they occupy
with others, an equally lofty position in the pro
fession. Ilicord is an illustrious example, a shin
ing light among the phiiosohical stars of his age
in Europe, and Dr. Czapkay has fully equalled
him in this country, as a proof of which, the Phil
adelphia College of Medicine complimented him
with a Diploma, and the honorary ad tvndem de
gree. Selecting this as liis field of operation, al
though qualified as a graduate of the University of
Pestli, and Into Chief Surgeon of the Hungarian
Revolutionary army, for more extended labors,
Dr. L. J. Cznpkay has bent his earnest attention
to the cure of Chronic und private diseases, in
which he has become so great an expert that he
is now regarded as the LKAUEII in this branch of
his profession throughout the United States, and
his portrait and biography are published as mat
ter ot interest to their readers in the most exclu
sive journals. The Doctor's offices ore at his Med
ical and Surgical Institute, on Sacramento street,
corner of Leidesdorff, nearly opposite thß build
ings of the Pacific Mail Steamship Company.
UtifWo ask particular attention of our readers
to the sworn certificates of remarkable cures, in
another column of this paper.
DR. L. J. CZAPKAY'S PRIVATE MEDICAL
and Surgical Institute is on Sacramento street, be
