NO EQUIVOCATION.
Congressman Joseph M. Dixon, in
a letter to Secretary Boynton of the
Helena Business Men's association ex
pressing his interest in the meeting
held at the capital yesterday to secure
better railroad rates for Montana,
makes clear his position as regards
the matter from a national point of
view.
Mr. Dixon is quite fulsome in his
praise of the president's message and
particularly on this all absorbing ques
tion, which he presented in such a
fair and masterly manner. Our con
gressman reflects the views of the
great majority in the lower house and
the sentiment that lias been gaining
ground in both houses since the mes
sage was read. A part of Mr. Dixon's
letter is as follows:
"It gives me pleasure to assure you
that 1 shall support the president's
recommendation in this matter, un
equivocally. His message, which was
read in the house this afternoon, was
a masterpiece and unanswerable. The
house will undoubtedly pass a bill
similar to the Esch-Townsend bill that
was passed one year ago early in the
session. I believe it to be the most
important and far-reaching legisla
tion with which congress lias dealt
since the reconstruction act forty
years ago. From all the information
I can gather here, it is my belief that
the house bill will pass the senate
also."
There is no guesswork alioul where
Mr. Dixon stands when il comes to
legislation tliat vitally affects his own
slate and tile people who have con
ferred high honors upon him. A peo
ple who admire the candor and sin
cerity of President Roosevelt cannot
help lint accord Mr. Dixon the full
measure of praise for the straight
forward manner in which lie declares
his position.

IS A STOCKMAN PASSENGER.
A case is before the courts down in
Kansns, the final decision of which
would be of interest to stockmen in
Montana, respecting the liability of, '
railroad companies in case of injur
ies sustained by those traveling on
trains for the purpose of looking af
ter stock.
The suit in point is one filed July 1,
1905, by Moses C. Harvey, against the
Missouri Pacific railway for $12.300
for personal injuries sustained on No
vember 10, 1905. On that date the
plaintiff was riding on a cattle train
from Usher, Wyandotte county, to
Kansas City, Mo., when the engine
and some of tlie cars ran off the
track. Harvey received several in
juries.
Now the railway, through its attor
neys, lias filed an answer to the peti
tion denying each and every allega
tion except tin' following: That the
railway undertook to transport two
cars of stock for Harv
to Kansas City. Mo., it admits that lit
accompanied the stock on tlie train,
hut did not pay any consideration for
ins transportation, but was on the
train under the terms and conditions
of the contract and not otherwise.
Tile answer further state s that the
train on which Harvey was riding was
a stock train, not constructed with
the conveniences of a passenger train,
or for the purpose of carrying passen
gers, and that the permission of the
defendant that the plaintiff might
trom t shor ;
ride thereon was without considéra
tion, hut a mere accommodation to|
the plaintiff, and he availed himself j
of such license and permission with
full knowledge of all the facts, and
by said contract of free transporta
tion, expressly assumed all of the
risks and inconveniences incident
thereto, and the injury to the plaintiff
was the result of a mere accident un
avoidable on tlie part of tlie defend
ant, and which could not have been
foreseen or guarded against.
It would seem that if the complain
ant took the risk knowing all of the
conditions, that it should absolve the
railroad from all responsibility in case
of accident, hut the courts, or a jury,
may hold differently.

gress. He has not only served a few
days longer in the senate than any
other man, hut has been in continuous
Public life longer than any other ex
cept the late Justin S. Morrill, of Ver
mont. Mr. Morrill served twelve years
in the house of representatives—from
1855 to 1807—and thirty-two years in
the senate—from 18G7 to 1899. He died
in January of that year. If he had
lived until March 3 he would have
completed his forty-third year of con
secutive service. Mr. Allison enter
ed the house of representatives Dec.
2. 1803. He was sworn in as sena
tor March 4, 1873 z and has been re
elected five times. His present and
sixth term expires March 4, 1909, and
if lie lives to that date he will he 80
years and otic day old, having been
born March 2, 1829. And he will have
served thirty-six consecutive years
in tile senate and forty-six consecu
tive years in the congress of the Unit
ed States. The late John Sherman
of Ohio was in public life longer than
Mr. Allison. He served six years in
die house, thirty-two years iu the sen
ate and nearly seven years in the cab
inet, as secretary of the treasury and
secretary of state. There are but few
aider men in the senate than Mr. Al
lison and none whose names are at
tached to more important legislation
than his. Conservative and cautious
he has made but few mistakes in his
long senatorial career. He not only
« njoys tlie confidence and esteem of
his senatorial colleagues in a high de
gree hut lias a strong hold on the
affections of his constituency, who
bave honored him for many years.

The new battleship Idaho, built by
the Cramps, was launched at Philadel
phia on the 9th inst. The Idaho is a
sister ship of the Mississippi, which
was launched a short time since. Her
keel was laid in 190). The Idaho lias
a displacement of 13,000 tons and will
he of 10,000 horse power. It is ex
pected to have a speed of 17 knots.
The estimated cost of the battleship is
$2,995,500. Its main battery will con
tain four 12-inch breechloading rif
les, eight 8-inch and eight 7-inch
breechloading rifles. The secondary
battery will include 12 3-inch rapid
fire guns, six 3-pounder rapid fire guns,
four 1-pounder rapid fire guns, two 3
field guns and eight machine
guns. While a formidable navy is
one of the liest guarantees of peace
with the outside world and while the
United States should have one equal
to any emergency, most Americans
will sincerely hope that the Idaho will
never fire a gun except at target prac
tice nor leave a home port except on
a peaceful mission.
Bozeman is another city that rejoic
es in the prospect of getting the Chi
cago & Milwaukee road. In a recent
issue the Republican-Courier maps out
how the road could get through
tile first spur of the Rocky mountains,
in the following: "In reality, the road
should make for upper Clark's fork,
so as to tap tlie prospectively rich
mines of the New World district at
; Cooke city, and the immediately sur
rounding country; thence down Soda
llutte creek io the East Fork of Yel
lowstone river: thence down tlie Yel
lowstone to Fridley of Brisbin; thence
ever the Trail creek divide and so on
down to the Gallatin valley. But that
natural and almost direct route would
involve the right of way through a cor
ner of tlie Yellowstone park which the
company would find great difficulty,
perhaps, in securing. But it has been
r on tended for years that the Trai'
creek pass is the most feasible for i \
rililroad yet found througU the B el
r . inKe of mountains; that , in reality
j u it . hundred feet lower that
tlie Bozeman pass, and that the ap
proaches to it from both east an'
west are less abrupt than those lead
ing to tlie Bozeman pass."

Whenever a newspaper is started
it is nothing but right that it should
promulgate a declaration of its poll
cies and intentions In order that those
who contemplate subscribing or sup- ;
porting the publication in any other
manner may have an idea of the na
ture of the enterprise which they are
being asked to assist. * * * •
In politics this paper will be dem
ocratic. Like all American people we
have our belief as to the best prin
cl pies of government and have no hes- 1
itancy in declaring that belief to the !
world. We believe that the general
tendency of our government today is
to return to those Jeffersonian doc-,
trines, Democratic, every one of |
them, which
has made our nation
great, and in season and out this,
Paper will be found advocating such !
doctrines
brothers and sisters of dead soldiers.
There are 13,000 pensioners in the
army and navy, of whom 10,030 are
invalids. Of the 998,441 pensioners
on the rolls, 717,158 were males and
281,283 were females and dependents.
A total of 81,853 new pension claims
were rejected during the year and !
22(i,822 claims are pending; 85,499
arc original claims. The amount paid
in pensions is less than last year:
1902, $137,504,300; 1903, $137,750,600;
1904, $141,693,600; 1905. $141.142,900.
The people of Boston arc up in arms
and have entered a vigorous protest
against the decision of Secretary of
the Navy Bonaparte that the old fri
gate Constitution be destroyed. The
secretary says the Constitution lies
keel deep in mud in the Charleston
navy yard near Boston and has been
so reconstructed that there is very
little left of the original vessel. There
is also a little expense attached to
keeping the vesel afloat, which is
one reason the secretary gives for
having it destroyed. Perhaps the
best thing congress can do is to turn
tlie Constitution over to the state of
Massachusetts, whose people would
take pride in its keeping and protec
tion. For once, at least, the bean
eaters have the sentiment of the coun
try with them.
Senator Carter has introduced a bill
to divide this state into two judicial
districts. The counties of Beaverhead
and Silver Bow and all the counties
west of the main range of mountains
to constitute the eastern district, and,
presumably, all the counties east of
the main range to constitute the east
ern distriel. The terms of the United
Stales court are to he held at Butte
and Missoula for the western district,
and at Helena and Great Falls for the
eastern district. At, present Judge
Hunt is required to hear and determ
ine all tlie federal court cases for the
entire state, which is more than one
judge can properly attend to. There
is good prospect of the senator suc
ceeding in securing favorable action
by congress.
The Inter Mountain says it remain
ed for a Boston trade paper to extend
the Milwaukee railway route from Ev
arts to Seattle without ever touching
Montana. T6 do this the road would
have to take a circuitous route and
leave out some of the best tributary
country between the Missouri river
and the coast. As the Milwaukee's
aim is to build up the intervening
country and secure business the Bos
ton publication cannot be taken ser
iously. Possibly it has a very limit
ed knowledge of Montana and the ton
nage it could give the Milwaukee road
now and in the years to come.

\
Governor Bell of Vermont stood firm
in his determination not to interfere
in tlie execution of Mrs. Rogers,
though petitions several miles in
length asking for executive clemency,
were presented to him. There seems
to lie great abhoronce at the thought
cl hanging a woman, it matters not
how diabolical the crime committed.
Not only thousands in Vermont, out
like numbers in other states petition
ed tlie governor to save the life of the
woman. This case may lead to an
agitation favoring the abolishment of
the death penalty, especially in Ver
mont.
Possibly Senator Clark was glad
that flowers were not permitted on the
desk of senators. It saved him the
necessity of buying his own.

1 There lias evidently been a senti*
! ment crystalizing among the educa
tional institutions of the country
against football as a college sport. At
a conference of thirteen colleges and
universities held in New York recent
ly,it was decided that the game should
r.ot be abolished, but should be re
formed, the vote standing 15 to 8.
Possibly the quickest way to bring
about a modification of the game was
; a threat to abolish it altogether. It
is only the brutal Part of football that
should be barred from college grounds.
The excellent performances given
by the Elks' minstrels is another proof
[that Lewistown has some exception
ally fine talent and that all that is
1 necessary to bring it out is a compe
! ,ent director and trainer. Both en
tertainments were financial and artis
*4° successes and a handsome sum will
,)e devoted to making the children
| «lad on Christmas eve.
Since they have heard the reading
,
! ° f , * e ' )resi f t ent s ""»"*? there is
said to be a change of sentiment
on railroad rate legislation on the part
of those senators who were counted
as his foes. The prospects are good
for the passage of a measure that will
meet the views of the president and
tlie needs of the country.
The Christmas number of the Argus,
which was published weil in advance
! order to reach our subscribers in
''emote parts of the county and to en
able general distribution before the
holiday period, has brought forth
hearty congratulations which are duly
appreciated.
Chauncey M. Depew has resigned
from the directorate of the Equitable

before he took a hint he would resign
his seat in the senate. He may be
invited to do so by the New' York
legislature.
Here's a pointer for cattlemen: At
Troy, Idaho, a six months' old calf was
butchered recently and its dressed
weight was 411 pounds. It was out of
a Holstein cow and by a Durham bull.
The cost of producing a calf of this
kind is little in excess of raising
scrubs.
According to an opinion recently
rendered by Attorney General Galen,
cattle may be assessed in the county
wherein is located the home ranch
and range, although they are not re
turned to that county after a winter's
feeding in another.
State Mine Inspector Walsh esti
mates that, including 1905, Butte has
pioduced $600,000,000 worth of copper
since the mines were first discovered,
and that Montana has left all compet
itors far behind in the race of copper
Pioduction.
Senator Clark has finally broken
1 is silence on railroad rate legislation
and says he "will support, a bill which
will best carry out that purpose."
This is somewhat non-committal and
will have to he taken for what it is
worth.
President Roosevelt says: "We wish
to insure as fair treatment for the
small town as for the big city, for the
small shipper as for the big shipper."
Will Senator Clark subscribe to that
doctrine?
By a vote of two to one the citi
zens of Ravalli county at a recent
election have turned down prohibition

The holiday shopping season is now

as they not only avoid the crowd of

have their pick of the cream of all
the stocks in the city. In this way,
therefore, the early buyer catches the
bargain, and those who delay select
