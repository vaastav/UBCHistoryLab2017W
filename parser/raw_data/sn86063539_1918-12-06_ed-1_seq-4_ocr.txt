THE IEACE CONFERENCE
President Wilson, Secretary ol
Stnic Robert Lunsinn ami Henry
White, Iniintr ambassador to
France nnil Italy, sailed Wednes
day, December 4, for France
C(lmicl U. M. House and (ibncr.il
Tanker II. HlidH are already in
France. The live liijrc niuiied
constitute the representatives of
thu United States at the peace
conference.
Considerable criticism of the
president's action in KIK as 01U'
of tliv representatives lias been
Indulged hi, much of it from
friendly sources; anil :ils, ap
parently, from the best of motives.
However, Hip carping criticism
indnJjfbd'iil by Colonel Wooscveli
and, if postible, Hint still mure
spectacular senator from Illinois
who suffers from a porioilic.il
brain-storm need excite no one
There may be a ipiestion nstothe
propriety and necessity of the
president Inking a part in the
cnuleretice, and results only will
tell whether or not it was advis
able. The president stated in his
message to congress the reasons
why he felt it incumbent on him
to go; and, possessed of such n
feeling, he didn't hesitate to o
uin representative! iiotwithstaiid
ii the criticism by friend and
fOc, As wu said before, results
are the things that count, and the
president bus shown that he pos
sostea a keener insight into affairs
than aify American, that his
critics have been repeatedly con
founded by his success in the face
of their criticism, and we leel as
sured that be wo'uhl not have
gdiie had u great necessity not
uXisted, and the further tact that
llis prmencB was very much de
sired by the allies.
Honest criticism of any oflicial
is not only permissible, but is
uxcrciscd, without abridgement,
and is in harmony with our insti
tution and, traditions; but none
of us need to be thrown nIT our
balance by the braying of mem
bers of the long-eared tribe that
believe noise is convincing.
Former President Kooscvtdt
suys President Wilson's trip to
France Is uncalled for and the
president's famous " fourteen
points" were of no concern to our
siildiurs nor our allies. Time will

American. Mine Active
Operations on the American i
mine at Nogal began this week j
active operations on tne mine
Itself. Machinery ha.cl been in
stalled, including large pumps for
dewatering the mine. It is cur
rently reported we didn't get the
information from President Fill
mer, who is not particularly com
municative that the dewateriug
of the mine- and all preliminary
operations preceding the actual
extraction of ore will require Irom
sixty to ninety days.
The American is one of the
oldest and by many considered
one of the best gold mines in the
county. It has produced some
very rich ore and its further
development will, it is believed, I
justify the cost now incurred to
reach the ore. The mine lias i
been idle for many years, due
largely to litigation, but also to
lack of cheap power. These
drawbacks no longer exist and
the property may now be econom
ically and profitably operated.
