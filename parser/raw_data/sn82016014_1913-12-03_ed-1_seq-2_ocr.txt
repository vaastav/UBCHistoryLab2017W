SCHOOL BOYS 3
They Came Out of East to Work
'. In Kansas Harvest Fields.
Pardoned From Reformatory
Today by Got. Hodges.
Three school boys came from the
cut last lummer to earn big wages
In, the Kansas harvest field. But In
stead of fat wages, they nearly starved
to death. Then they stole some cloth
ing and groceries from a Mexican,
railway camp In Mankato. were ar
rested, convicted and sentenced to
terms In the Hutchinson reformatory.
This morning Governor Hodges gave
the boys a pardon when he received
petitions signed by every merchant In
Mankato. - ' -
John QuinUn, Herman Kraus and
Clifford Clotsenberg lived in an east
ern town. One day they picked up a,
newspaper that told of the demand
for harvest hands in Kansas. They
read the glaring headlines which told
how western farmers stopped the
trains, dragged people into the wheat
fields at the point of a gun. fed them
fried chicken and dumplings three
times a day and when the wheat was
tacked paid the harvesters enough
wage to buy an automobile. It all
seemed very real to the three school
boys who had never seen a harvest
field and knew nothing of the Kan
sas grain crop.
So, that night the three boys boards
ed a local freight train bound for
Kansas. They arrived In Mankato,
the county seat of Jewell county.
They were nearly starved to death and
began to look up and down the track
for the farmers who were clamoring
for help. But there were no farmers
In sight. No one wanted harvest
hands. No one had a kind word for
the boys and no one offered them pie
and cake and chicken. There wasn't
the price of a square meal in the
pockets of the lads and they gath
ered on the depot platform to talk
things over. Then the town marshal
told them to move on and threatened
to throw them in Jail as suspicious
characters if they loitered In their
travels.
It was after the Interview with the
town constabulary that the boys
broke into a Mexican hut on. the rail
road right of way and stole some
clothes and enough groceries to af
ford a square meal. The marshal ar
rested the boys after their meal. For
five and a half months the youngsters
stayed in jail waiting for a trial. They
were convicted and the district Judge's
only course was to sentence them to
the reformatory.
In the meantime the town had
learned the story of the three mis
guided youths. They went to the
county attorney and the district judge
with the facts and these men signed a
petition for a pardon. Then all the
merchants of the town and all of the
tax .payers who could And a place on.
the petition for their signatures, at
tached their names to the prayer for
a pardon. More than 100 people
signed the application. - . The petition
was received in the governor's office
today and the boys were given par
dons. But back in the little eastern town
where the boys live, there will be no
undue haste in future years to come
to the Kansas harvest fields. These
boys have learned that the Kansas
farmer does not look for harvest
hands with a shotgun and that the
stories of apple dumplings and chick
en pie and extravagant wages are not
true and next year they will stay away.
WILSON FAILED THEM.
Snffragists Criticise Omission of Their
Cause from Message.
Washington, Dec 8. Dr. Anna
Howard Shaw, president of the Na
tional Woman Suffrage association,
created a sensation at the night ses
sion of the convention, when she de
clared President Wilson had fallen
short of the greatest opportunity he
ever had or ever would have, in fail
ing to say a word -In behalf of the
woman' suffrage when he read his an
nual message to congress. Her re
marks provoked loud and prolonged
applause.
Dr. Shaw said she Had hoped the
S resident would' arise to the occasion,
ut that while he had recognized the
necessity xor tne extension of the bal
lot to the Filipinos and urged terri
torial voters' rights for Alaska, he
had failed to mention woman suffrage
in his message.
"President Wilson," she continued,
"referred in his message to the fact
that the time had come for an exten
sion of greater social justice, and we
women eagerly listened to this. We
had hoped that social Justice would
Include some measure of political Jus
tice to the women of the country. I
feel fully the measure of disappoint
ment which under the circumstances
is natural, for the time had come for
the president to say a word in our be
half. "We feel that President Wilson has
fallen short of the greatest opportun
ity which has come to him or ever
will come to him. No other president
has ever had such an opportunity.
President Wilson has had the oppor
tunity of speaking a word which
might ultimately lead to the en
franchisement of a large part of the
human family. Even Lincoln, who by
a word freed a race, had not this op
portunity to release from the bonds
one-half of the human family.
"I feel that I must make this state
ment as broad as it is for the reason
that we at Budapest last year realized
that ' womankind throughout the
world looked to the United States to
blaze the way for-the extension of
universal suffrage. In every quarter of
this globe. President Wilson has
missed the one thing that might have
made it possible for him to never be
forgotten."
When Dr. Shaw concluded, the Con
vention. flLfniri .nthll.taafl.
adopted by acclamation the following

PEEBLES MAKES MARK
Breaks Golf Records at Tulsa and
Oklahoma City.
Bob Peebles, professional of the
Topeka Country club, continues to
play record golf on the links of the
various clubs In Oklahoma. His last
successful play was in Tulsa, when
he made a number of local and state
records. At Tulsa, while playing with-
Arthur Jackson, professional of the
same town, they defeated Profes
sionals Nichols of Muskogee and Nel
son of Oklahoma City by I up and
one to play.
Peebles led the field in this con
test. He played the 36 holes in 167,
Nelson in 170. Nichols In 171 and
Jackson in 173. In this event. Peebles
and Jackson won a purse of $100 and
Peebles won an Individual purse of
1 50 ror low score record.
In making this score he broke all
course records. He made the first
nine holes In 36, thereby establishing
a nine hole record; he made the first
18 holes in 75, thus establishing a
new 18 hole record by two holes, and
he made another record by making
the 36 holes in 157.
In addition to these records, he es
tablished a 36-hole record on, the
Oklahoma City links by making the
rounds in 147.
His play at Tulsa was handi
capped by bad weather and this pre
vented him from making a better
showing. Mr. Peebles will return to
Topeka during the latter part of the
week.
DYNAMITE EXPLOSION.
Two Men Have Narrow Escape at
Oak Hill.
Oak Hill. Dec. 8. While grubbing trees
on the F. D. Wendt farm, F. E. Wendt
and Fred Blake came near meeting death
In an explosion of dynamite. A heavy
charge had been placed under a large tree.
The explosion did not occur as soon as
was expected, and so an Investigation
was started, Blake probing under ' the
tree with a crowbar. He was hurled thirty
feet and badly injured and may lose his
eyesight. Wendt, who was knocked down
but not injured,-carried Blake to a farm
house nearby. Later he was taken to Oak
Hill and Is receiving treatment here.
Both men were within six feet of the
explosion, which was so severe that the
heavy crowbar, an inch thick, was broken
to pieces.
TRIBUTE TO WASHBURN
Coach Ixrvrman of Aggies Says Blue
Great Team.
In connection with writing the
State Journal about some other mat
ters, Coach Lowman of the Aggies
has the following to say about the
Washburn football team:
"The people of Washburn should be
prouM of their team. I certainly hand
it to that bunch and want to say they
have the best team that Washburn
has had since I have been at the Agri
cultural college. I feel equally proud
of my bunch, although we did not win
the game. The people who paid to
see the Thanksgiving game sure got
their money's worth. It was one of
the best exhibitions of straight foot
ball that I have seen In many days.
Both of us resorted to that style of
attack in order to wear the other team
out. I note that your paper seems to
make something of the fact that
Hoover was an old' Aggie player.
There is nothing in this. Hoover
never attended Agricultural college,
but Is an ex-Baker man. Am sure
Washburn has the right man In
Gray."
HIS FIRST REPORT.
(Continued from rw one.)
ready to issue $500,000,000 of emer
gency currency under the Aldrich
Vreeland act to prevent restriction of
credits and to ease any situation.
Mr. McAdoo details the treasury s
offer to loan to banks of the country
money to move the fall crops. The
sum of $46,500,000 out of $50,000,000
estimated to be needed was appor
tioned among the states.
"It was essential," says the secre
tary, "that the action of the depart
ment be non-partisan and non-political;
the crops of Republicans, Demo
crats and Progressives, and all other
classes of people had to be moved,
and the earnest effort of the depart
ment was to have the benefits of this
action diffused as widely and impar
tially as possible."
The New Tariff law.
; Of the new tariff act Secretary Mc
Adoo says it has not been in force a
sufficient length of time to make pos
sible an accurate estimate of it Ulti
mate revenue- nroducing powers. He
asks congress to impose a nominal
tax of 1 per cent proor gallon on a
alcohol withdrawn for denaturation
and legislation requiring every dealer
in leaf tobacco to make an inventory
of stock January 1 of each year and
make a report of his transactions quar
terly or monthly, and that every dealer
be required to give oona.
The present oleomargarine law is de
clared to be unsatisfactory and the
government is said to lose more taxes
from illicit practices in oleomargarine
than through moonshine stills. The
difference in the tax on colored and
uncolored "oleo" is held responsible for
the loss and congress is asked to im
pose a flat nominal tax without any
difference for color with provision for
individual stamped or original packages
of certain- sixes adequately marked and
safeguarded. The law governing the
ale of adulterated batter is declared
to have brought about unfortunate
conditions through the difficulty of its
Just enforcement.
His. Recommendations.
Among his principal recommendations
to congress the secretary placed the
following:
Enlargement of the public health ser
vice and a closer co-operation with
state authorities to prevent and stamp
out epidemics of disease.
Building of four revenue cutters, for
need of which the secretary points out,
the service is seriously crippled.
Consolidation of the revenue cutter
and life-saving services into one or
ganisation to be known as the coast
guard. Such a consolidation, the secre
tary says, would increase the efficiency
of each service with the idea that the
new coast guard should become a first
naval reserve in time of war. The in
crease in cost would be about $400,000.
In that connection the secretary also
recommends passage of legislation for
the retirement of life-savers on pen
sion, and declares that unless some such
measure is made law, the efficiency of
the service will be impaired and it will
become increasingly difficult to ob
tain good men. He gives point to his
argument by showing that the revenue
cutter and life-saving services saved
4.423 lives In 1913 and salvaged property
woth more than $16,000,000.
. Establishment of revenue cutter
headquarters at Louisville or Cincin
nati, at .St. Louis or some other point
on the upper Mississippi and at Hel
ena, Ark or Vlcksburg, Miss., is
urged as a measure for the saving of
live in the floods time in the Ohio and
Mississippi valleys. Three light
draught cutters to cost about $80,000
each are recommended. With the
rivers at normal stage they would be
used in patrol to enforce the naviga
tion and motor boat laws.
Tax on the Banks.
The report refers to the require
ment that banks which hold govern
ment deposits made April SO, 191$,
pay interest at two per cent, declar
ing that it means an annual revenue'
of $2,000,000 to the government and
showing that if such a regulation had
been made in 1897 the government
would now have received in interest
more than $80,000,400.
The income tax is not dwelt upon at
length, but the report estimates that
425,000 individuals are subject to it
and that corporations not heretofore
subject to .tax will number about
: 150,000.
Speaking of scientific research fav
the public health service the report
says:
On account Of the announeementa
of discoveries of alleged cures for tu
berculosis and their bearing on public
health, important Investigations of
them have been undertaken. Studies
of the Friedmann treatment were
sufficiently advanced by May 16, 1918,
to justify a report that the observa
tions made up to that time did not
warrant the confidence In the remedy
which had been Inspired by wide
spread publicity. This investigation
is being continued, as are also studies
of other . preparations claimed as
cures."
Secretary McAdoo estimates that the
revenues for the fiscal year exclusive of
iwsioince receipts win De 3728,000,000,
only $8,000,000 less than the estimates
for the fiscal year 1914. To make that
total he expects the customs to bring
in $249,000,000, ordinary internal revenue
$315,000,000 and the income tax $105,000.
000, of which $40,000,000 is to come from
corporations, the remainder from indi
viduals. From sales of public lands he exnects
to cover into the treasury $3,000,000 and
irom miscellaneous sources $56,000,000.
He expresses the belief that the ordi
nary receipts for 1915 will exceed the
disbursements sufficiently to pay out
about $26,000,000 from the treasury gen
eral fund for the Panama canaL

every day and that his fall is to be ex
pected. It was hardly believable that
President Wilson would have - the
temerity to assert such a thing. He
thereby gives testimony of his bad
faith towards things Mexican." - "
The Imparcial says: "From a good
source it is known that some of the
foreign ministers accredited to Wash
ington criticise the message severely.
They say it would be impossible to
guarantee the re-establishment of
peace and good government in Mexico
if Provisional President Huerta, whose
vigorous efforts at the pacification of
tne country are well known, should
leave the presidency."
What Wilson Meant.
Washington, Dec 3. The flight of
Huerta's generals in northern Mexico,
federal evacuation of Chihuahua and
Ouaymas and the refusal of Mexican
oil companies to furnish fuel for
movement of federal troop trains
were pointed out by officials here to
day as such events to which President
Wilson referred In his message to
congress yesterday when he declared
the Huerta regime was crumbling-"by
a iitue every aay."
Flght Near the Capital.
Mexico City, Dec 3. A sharp fight
occurred today near the federal capital
between a small detachment of rural
guards who were caught in ambush by
a body of followers of Emilliano Za
pata. The rurales returned the fire of
the rebels for twenty minutes, during
which the rebels -are said to have fled.
The casualties of both parties number
ten dead and thirty wounded.
BURY CRCMMER AT OLD HOME.

to Flaxen.
Anthony. Kan., Dec, 8. The busi
ness men of this city last night showed
their appreciation of the good record
made by the football team of An
tbonys high school. A banquet In
honor of the team was given at the
Burchfleld hotel. The dining room
was decorated in the colors of the
school, purple and gold, and flags and
pennants were hung about and tro
phies of the school were on exhibition.
One hundred and fifty people partici
pated in the banquet. Both the first
and second teams were honored in the
banquet. All the things dear to the
football fans were present, enrysan
themums, big and bright, were used
in decorations and worn by the foot
ball players. .An ample menu was
served. There was music by the
teachers of the school and talks on ap
propriate subjects made by business
men, teachers, ministers and others.
R. P. McColloch of the Anthony
Bulletin acted as toastmaster and un
der his direction a number of novel
stunts were pulled off. presents for
the coach, M. H. Sims, and for mem
bers of the team were awarded and in
every way the people of the city made
manifest their interest in the football
team of this year, the high school and
the public schools of the city.
MERCHANTS WANT KENNEDY.
Lawrence Students and Alumni Start
ing Something.
Lawrence, Kan.. Dec 3. The mer
chants - of Lawrence plan to start a
petition for the return of Bert Ken
nedy to K. U. .football. This petition
is said to be a forerunner of one that
the students' will circulate soon. The
coaching situation at the university Is
in an awful muddle. Chancellor
Frank Strong, in opposition to the
general sentiment of the students and
alumni, -declared for Mosse and stated
that the present head coach should be
retained and be allowed to pick his
own assistant.''
Coach Kennedy's record with the
Haskell Indians this season was re
markable from many angles. His
team piled up a total score of 419
against 31 for their opponents. This
is a bigger score than any team in the
country made. The highest score made
in any one game was 101 against Mid
land college. The last three games of
the season were played within ten
days and only fourteen men were used,
showing the excellent condition of the
players.
The Indian players proved to be the
best exponents of the open style play
of any gridiron warriors In the valley.
At times during the season the team
used the Minnesota shift play with
success. Kennedy had his men train
ed in the fundamentals of football
that they were experts in every phase
of the game.
There is a strong sentiment at the
university for the return of Kennedy.
The students believe that the popular
mentor is the logical man to head the
coaching staff of the school.
Already it is rumored that raosse in
tends to name Jay Bond, this year's
freshman coach, as his assistant for
next year.

Indifferent to unfavorable news.
Bonds were irregular.
The active stocks were generally hicher
at tne opening tooay. jsne was again in
gooa aemana ana tne can snares made
a further recovery from their recent
slump. Can preferred gaining a point. New
