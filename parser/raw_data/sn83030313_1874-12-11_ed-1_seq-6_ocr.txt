The Session of the Baptist Convention of
Social Unions was quite interesting yesterday,
and was addressed by Governors Tilden and

The Examination of Count Von Arnim was
continued yesterday, and he explained his
reasons for withholding certain papers, some
of which he had, for his own protection,
removed beyond the Prussian frontier.
Ecnnino the Cuban Blockade.?The dar
ing adventures of Colonel Pacheco, who
crossed the Caribbean Sea from Jamaica, and
twice ran the Spanish blockade, are narrated
in his own language elsewhere. He brings
direct news from the headquarters of the pat
riots, and his reports are decidedly favorable
to the Cuban cause.
Jisa Pomehot, the boy murderer, whose
crimes, committed with no other motive than
that of malignity, have shocked the public,
has been found guilty of murder in the first
degree. The plea of insanity was rejected,
but if there is such a disease as moral insanity
there is no doubt that this youthful murderer
must have had it to a very unusual extent.
The Court is expected to sentence him to-day.
The Cuban Wab.?The ship which was
taken into Santiago de Cuba by a Spanish
gunboat proves to be a British vessel. The
vessel has been liberated, but an English
passenger is still held as a prisoner. It is not
improbable that this affair will be promptly
resented by Great Britain, and may help to
hasten the joint interference of other nations
in Cuban affairs, which President Grant seems
to think is inevitable.
The Prxhidknt's Message in Madrid.?By
Special telegram from Madrid we learn that
the Spaniards were temporarily and violently
excited by the reading of a news report which
purported to present extracts from President
Grant's Message to Congress. The Dons
Wrere furious against us. They found out, al
onoet immediately, that the extracts from the
American document were grossly garbled, a
^corrected version of the utterance of our
Chief Magistrate having been received by the
Madrid Cabinet This was published, and
ftt the latest moment the anti-American furor
Was cooling down. It is to be hoped that it
Will disappear completely, and with it the
^natural disposition toward its renewal. , ,
Tl?* Bloody Oatbrwki U Mississippi*
The full but, in bomu respects, conflicting
accounts which we printed yesterday of the
deplorable scenes of violence at and near
! Vicksburg require sifting and explanation to
i bring out the oardinal facts and fix 'he re
sponsibility for the slaughter. The longest of
J those accounts was telegraphed to the ILebalo
I by Governor Ames, iroui Jackson, the State
i capital, a place distant from the scene of the
' troubles and subject to some disadvantages in
gaining precise and detailed information.
The sources of Governor Ames' knowledge
seem to have been exclusively men of his own
political party, who were under a strong bias
1 in favor of Crosby, the deposed negTO Sheriff,
and his negro defenders, who were the vic
tims of the conflict. It does not appear that
the Governor had held communication with
anybody on the other sid#, and his state
ment must accordingly be regarded as
ex parte. The other and shorter but
more circumstantial account was tela
graphed to us by the city editor of the
Vicksburg Herald, who, writing on the spot of
matters within the scope of his professional
duties, ought to be one of the best informed
men in Vicksburg respecting the facts ; but
he, too, is evidently under a bias, though iu
the opposite direction. It is safe to accept as j
authentio the statements in which the two
despatches agree, and these are perhaps suffi
cient to enable us to form a correct judgment
of this deplorable affair.
Both accounts agree that those bloody con
flicts were uot between the whites and negroes
of the city of Vicksburg, but between the
whites of Vicksburg and negroes from the
surrounding country. And yet the sceno of
the bloody affrays was either just within or a
little outside the city limits. The question
then arises how it happened that just at the
break of day, on a December morning, bodies
of negroes, several hundred strong, from dis
tant parts of the county, were discovered
marching toward the city? Why did |
they leave their homes and assemble
at places of rendezvous in the night,
and then by a night march con
centrate from different directions at the
town of Vicksburg ? It is quite evident that
if they had stayed at their homes and slept that
night in their beds the bloody encounters of
which many of them were victims would not
have occurred. It is impossible, in view of
these undisputed facts, to deny that the
negroes were the aggressors.
The next question is, What motive had they
in leaving their homes in various parts of the
county by concert, and so timing their move
ments as to reach the city at an hour when
most of its inhabitants would be still in bed?
It seemed like an army attempting to capture
an enemy's camp by surprise. But what
called those rural negroes together at an hour
and under circumstances so unusual? This is
a point on which there is no discrepancy in
the different accounts. They came to Vicksburg
from their homes in the country in order to
maintain the negro Sheriff Crosby in his
office, which he was in danger of losing by
the action of the white citizens. Up to the
time of their assembling for this purpose
there was no bloodshed and no likelihood of ]
any. Now, whether there were good grounds
for displacing Crosby or not, it is plain that
the negroes from the country were acting with
out authority and bent on an illegal object.
If Crosby was in danger of being ousted* with
out cause it was for the courts of the State or
the Governor of the State to protect and de
fend him, citizens having no warrant to come
to his rescue until summoned by the proper
authorities. When an attack on the town
seemed imminent by those bodies of outside
negroes, an alarm was given, the citizens as
sembled under arms, went out to meet the
negroes and easily put them to flight, killing
and wounding quite a number. It is clear
that the negroes were the challenging, aggres
sive party, and would have escaped all harm
if they had not concerted measures for taking
the city by surprise and reinstating Crosby,
the negro Sheriff
Uae specious argument used by Ciovernor
Ames to invalidate this conclusion deserves
gome notice. "The same old story," be says,
??negroes killed by the score, none of their
opponents hurt, and still the negro to blame."
11? the negroes had equal courage and equal ex
perience and skill in the use of firearms this
argument would seem plausible. Almost
every white man in Mississippi is an old Con
federate soldier, while not one negro in a hun
dred ever had a gun in his hands till since the
war, and they have never been trained in sit
uations which give steadiness and self-posses
sion in danger. The consequence is that
they get panic-stricken and break and run at
the beginning of an encounter, while the well
aimed firing of veteran white soldiers does
deadly execution. The disproportion in the
numbor of negroes killed does not disprove
the fact that they left their homes in the night
and mustered at Vicksburg for an illegal pur
pose, tyid thereby provoked the slaughter of
which they complain.
The action of the whites in relation to the
negro Sheriff,. Crosby, though legally inde
fensible, admits of some apology. It is
charged by his opponents, and not denied by
Governor Ames, that Crosby had not given
the bond required of the Sheriff by law.
The Governor says?probably on Crosby's
authority, who visited Jackson to confer with
him?that tho Sheriff's accounts are all
straight; but even if this is true it does not
meet the charge that Crosby had not given
legal bonds. So far as it has any force it is
an argument against that provision of the
law which requires sheriffs to give bonds,
an argument which does not become the
Governor of the State, who is sworn to seo
that the laws are executed, whether he thinks
them necessary or not It iB charged by
Crosby's enemies, but not admitted by Gover
nor Ames, that he has been engaged in pack
ing juries to insure the escape of Daven
port, the negro Chancery clerk, who
has been indicted by the Grand Jury, and ab
stracted and concealed the official records
which contained the evidence of his guilt
An association of citizens, called the Tax
payers' League, waited on Crosby and forced
[him to resign, whether with or without
threats of violence is a disputed point Be
i this as it may, their action was undoubtedly
illegal, although it seemed to meet the general
approval of the respectable, property-holding,
, tax-paying class of the citizcns of Vicksburg.
| There is no reason to doubt that the conduct
J of the negro officials furnished them with
" pretexts and provocations for their irregular
course.
An soon as those troubles arose Governor
Ames should have interposed to maintain
order, enforce the law and protect both sides
in their rights. If the Sheriff had not given
proper bonds he should have compelled him
to do so or give up the office. He
should have assured the taxpayers that
he wpuld examine their complaints and
redress their real grievances. He should have
prevented the assembling of the rural neproes
to menace Vicksburg with an attack. Had he
been active and vigilant he might have pre
vented these troubles ; but, unfortunately, his
activity and vigilance would have been ex
erted against the negroes, to whom l?e owed
his election, and it requires more than ordi
nary virtue and fortitude for an officer to
pursue a course which would offend and es
trange his supporters. According to our pres
ent information, of which the most important
part is furnished by himself. Governor Ames
cannot be held blameless for permitting this
difficulty, which is not of sudden growth, to
ripen into armed conflict and bloodshed.
DlirMll.
A despatch publishod in yesterday's Herald
should not escape attention. Mr. Disraeli,
the English Prime Minister, is reported as
having retired into an inland English village,
refusing to see a deputation and remarking
"that his absence from London would proba
bly be protracted." The recent English pa
pers announce that he had been confined to
his room with an attack of the gout The
London correspondent of a provincial paper
pictures the Premier as "sitting before a fire
with his limbs wrapped in flannel." We
know his long planned visit to Ireland was
postponed because of his illness. Ail these
circumstances go to confirm the impression
that the Premier is ilL It is therefore
not surprising to ltarn, as we do from recent
despatches, that a meeting of Conservatives
has been held to determine upon whom the
leadership of the party should fall in the
event of his retirement or death.
Disraeli is an old man, if we may call
seventy years the beginning of old ago. He
is now approaching his seventieth year, and
for fifty years ho has been a very busy man?
nearly fifty years have elapsed since he wrote
his rhapsody of "Vivian Grey." It is nearly
forty years since he came into public life. He
has had a remarkable career. His race, his
education, his associations, his character, all
against him, he has had to fight his way step
by step until he, the descendant of a foreign
refugee and an alien faith, became the leader
of the proud tory party of England, and the
head of the Cabinet in which Fat as his ser
vants the Earl of Derby, the Marquis of Salis
bury, the Duke of Bichmond, and others, repre
senting the proudest names and bluest blood of
Great Britain. A career like tliis would natu
rally make the strongest man grow old before
his time; and there have been many indica
tions that Mr. Disraeli is failing. His blunder
at the Guildhall dinner, and his public apol
ogy in the columns of the Times a few days
after, were the greatest errors that an English
statesman could commit. They could only be
attributed to a weakening mind. Mr. Dis
raeli is the Inst statesman who would sue for
mercy at the ieet of Bismarck; the astonishing
effect of this humiliation in the British mind,
the general condemnation that has fallen upon
him for his course, the certainty that it will
be a matter of reproach in the next Parlia
ment, and the brilliant stroke of Gladstone in
summoning to his banner the Protestant
party, whose alienation led to his defeat, may
all contribute to that illness of mind which so
often accompanies the ailing body.
Mr. Disraeli's retirement from public life
would be the close of a brilliant and ex
traordinary career. There has been no such
career in England since the time of Canning.
In many reap acts he rosombles Canning?in
his lowly fortunes, the struggles of his life,
his facility in rhetoric, his felicity of leader
ship. Canning grasped the Premiership and
died after a brief tenure of office. He was
surrounded by the same elements ?of dissatis
faction that surround Disraeli. Wellington
opposed him; the King accepted him with
reluctance; his cabinet never forgot that he
was in, many respects an adventurer. If he
had ii6t died it is a question whether he
would have succeeded in the founding
of a policy or a party. But Can
ning left behind him a sentiment
which his early death developed into a party,
and this, wo fear, Disraeli will not leave. He
is an evidence of what patience, courage and
skill will do in any calling. He is the toler
ated, if not the recognized leader of the tories.
The true leader would be Lord Salisbury,
who is intellectually the strongest man in the
Cabinet, who has already mutinied under the
leadership of Disraeli, who, only a few
months since, was publicly rebuked for this
mutiny, and who gives his chief a sullen and
scornful service, more in the interests of his
party than its Premier. Lord Derby is a
cold man, who owes bis position largely to his
wealth, ancestry and family alliances. If Mr.
Disraeli passes away the leadership will do
doubt devolve upon Lord Derby or Lord
Salisbury. We cannot think that either of
these noblemen has the quality necessary to
found a party that will be at all in sympathy
with the progressive sentiment of modern
j England.
The Sinking Fund Securities.?It is sin
gular that Comptroller Green should exhibit
go much anxiety to have the sinking fund se
curities examined by some parties other than
the authorities on whom the charter devolves
that important duty. At the meeting of the
Sinking Fund Commission yesterday, on
motion of the Comptroller, Mayor Vance and
Chamberlain Lane wore appointed a commit
tee for that purpose. This is entirely un
necessary, since the charter requires that the
Commissioners o^ Accounts shall make the
examination of the securities 4n December,
and the Commissioners who huve just been
restored to office are capable of performing
the work in a proper munner. Besides, it
seems absurd to make the Chamberlain, who
j is the custodian of the moneys and securities
of the city, one of two examiners to ascertain
! whether ths securities are intact Mayor
Vance will do well to decline the office thus
conlerred on him by the Comptroller, and to
direct the Commissioners of Accounts to make
the examination as required by the law.
In tbz House yesterday Mr. Kelley's finan
cial bill was the subject of extended debate,
but no definite action was had.
C?a tb* Republicans Unite 1
It is now clear to even the letst thoaghtfal
of the republicans in Wellington that unless
they can quickly unite their party upon a
definite and positive policy, and vigorously
push that to a conclusion with all the force of
the administration, they are lost Their op
ponents have a year in which to deliberate,
but with the republicans it is now or never.
There is but one question upon which the
eyes of the whole people, East, West and
South, are fixed, and that is the currency
question. In whatever direction men look
it is this which stares them in the face. The
President's Message, the Treasury report, the
attitude of the inflationists, all show that this
is a ghost which cannot be put down, and
that, however much they would like to drilt,
if the republican leaders mean to preserve
their party they must unite upon some pos
sible financial policy and carry it through.
Can they? Is it not too late? Can
the incoherent elements be fused to a
common purpose? If the President were
as powerful au organizer in peace as
he was in war; if he understood the
principles which underlie the question of
finance, or if he would givo his confidence to
men who do and confine himself to the task
of bringing together the discordant bands
who still, with varying motives and hopes,
fight under the republican banner, something
might be hoped for the party. It is still
strong in numbers,- but it needs a leader and
an objective point A President like Jefferson
or Jackson would know how to retrieve this
late defeat, how to restore confidence and
good humor, how to gather the hosts for a
combined effort toward a determined end.
But it is doubtful if General Grant can do
this. His nature is to "fight it out on that
line," and in politics it is necessary to change
one's base, to make new plans, to acknowledge
impossibilities; more pounding away will not
do it
Tbe state of opinion in the present Con
gress is such that without some extreme and
forcible impulsion it would do nothing either
to improve or degrade the currency. How to
give this impulse is the vital question for the
republicans. They have, unfortunately for
themselves, no leader in whom they have con
fidence, and they need a really great loader,
a man possessed both of capacity and courage,
to make headway. What can they do ? The
problem before them is to adopt at this ses
sion, and as early as possible, a measure defi
nitely, and not disastrously, settling the cur
rency question?leading the country surely
toward resumption, but not causing a too bur
densome pressure. All enterprise is stopped
because of uncertainty and vague apprehen
sion of the future. No one will extend his
business or enter upon new ventures while he
cannot tell whether the so-called dollar will
be worth fifty cents or a dollar and a half a
year hence. The banks, especially in the
West are full of money; the farmers are
prosperous, the country is rich. But all is
useless without certainty.
The party which gives this assurance,
whose legislation once more fixes values, or
at least puts them in the course of a deter
minate arrangement will win the confidenoe
and tbe gratitude of the nation, because it
will Btart the wheels of industry and put
lasting prosperity within our reach. If the
republican party does this it may regain its
now perishing future, for the democrats will
not dare at the next session to disturb any
definite and sensible arrangement of this
question which may be made now. The
whole country will have settled down to what
ever may be fixed and will protest against
new measures, against change, even though it
wero for the better.
It is still not too late for the republican
leaders. If a dozen of them bad genius
enough to devise a sound measure of finance,
the good fortune to get the President to heart
ily support it and the courage to show an
open door to Mr. Kelley, General Butler and
all other deserters, they might still save them
selves. The party whip is still powerful, but
it nocds to be swung by a vigorous and deter
mined arm. Threats of desertion must not
terrify, nor the howls of camp followers con
fuse, those who enter on such a campaign.
Are there a dozen men in the republican
party capable of thus snatching it out of the
jaws of defeat capable of devising a policy
and sternly forcing their reluctant followers to
support it ? If so we may yet see an interest
ing and important session. But it will not do
to delay.
The Siege of Iran.
The fall story of the siege of Iran and its
bombardment by the Carlists, of the prepara
tions for the assault, of the sadden change
of plans and tbfe raising of the siege, and then
of the retreat of the army pursued by the
republicans, is vividly described in our cor
respondence from Hendaye. It is a sad story
if read from the Carlist point of view, as it
shows how desperate is Don Carlos' position,
and we now can understand why he has been
deserted by the Bishop of Urgel and by others
who have long followed him with fidelity and
courage. The campaign which had Iran for
its central point has not only failed, but has
demonstrated the weakness of the cause of Don
Carlos or the incapacity of his generals.
He is morally strong in the devotion of the
people and the troops, but that cannot Bupply
the want of numbers and material of war.
Our correspondent cannot account for the
sudden raising of the siege, except on the
theory that the Carlist generals were alarmed
by false reports of the approach of the
enemy. Had the assault been made he
thinks Iran could have been occupied and
the whole campaign reversed. But it is
not now of much value to speculate upon
what might have happened. General Loma's
advance was fatal, and the capture of the
heights of San Marco cut the Carlist
army in two. What followed was
simply disaster, attended by the usual
evils of war?burning villages and
homeless people flying before the victors.
There are many glimpses of Don Carlos in
our letters, from the sccne on the heights
where he held his royal levee, surrounded by
a little court, when speedy triumph appeared
certain, to his retreat at night, and the*
despair and wrath of the disappointed troops.
It is a picturesque chapter in Spanish
history that our correspondent has written,
and a clear analysis of the events which seem
to make the overthrow of the Carlist power a
mere question of time. How energetically
General Loma proposes to follow up his ad
, vantage is uhown by the proclamation which.
according to oar cable despatches, he intends
to issue, demanding the surrender of the Car
lists within eight days, and threatening to
deaolate the country if they refuse.
Tli* Obicrratloai ot ike Transit of
T?u?
Enough already has been heard from the
astronomical expeditions to enable us to say
with a reasonable degree of certainty that the
transit of Venus has been successfully ob
served. Everything that experience and study
could suggest for accuracy in making
the observations was provided, and the
astronomers asked nothing more than clear
weather. Fortunately this Beems to have been
generally granted, aud we only hear of abso
lutely unfavorable weather from Omsk, Oren
burg, Kasan, Uralsk, Astrachan, Kertch and
Tiflis. In these plaoes the expeditions failed.
Partial obscurations of the sun have been
reported from Vladivostok and Nagasaki,
but they were not permanent, and interfered
but little with the work of measuring and
photographing the passage of the planet In
Yokohama the success was perfect, and ex
cellent observations were made at Cairo and
Suez.
The data collected from stations far apart
from each other will be, therefore, sufficient
to insure the grand object of the expeditions.
The results will not be known for years, but
the public will rejoice in the assurance that
the total experiment is substantially a suc
cess. It is impossible not to see how
great a part the system of weather
signals and predictions, which is now
being developed so carelully in this country
and Europe, may play hereafter in similar
scientific investigations. Local cloudy
weather will not then be so likely as it is now
to defeat well luid plans of observation, as
the probabilities of oveu a few days would
enable astronomers to selcct more fuvorable
stations.
We publish to-day the report of the English
expedition to Egypt, news of the American
astronomers in Hobart Town, Van Dieman's
Land, and from the European observers in
Persia. With this is an article from the Lon
don limes which compliments the methods
the American astronomers have employed, and
considers that their labors will go far toward
the solution of the grand problem.
Thanksgiving In German jr.
It has frequently been observed that our
foreign-born citizens delight in nothing so
much as m transplanting their customs to our
American soiL It would be interesting to
trace our various home legends and amuse
ments to their European nativity. As
these legends and amusements owe much
of their value to their antiquity we cannot in
our young days be said to have contributed
anything of special value. America is the
land which has never produced a legend or a
fairy tale, unless we can call Pocahontas a
legend, as we suppose it is, or Rip Van
Winkle a fairy tale, which it should be. In
the way of anniversaries we have our share;
but they are, as a general thing, noisy and
selfish, and celebrate our war triumphs,
about which the world cares nothing, and we
ourselves less and less. Who, for in
stance, assembles on the 8th of Janu
ary to drink the "glorious and im
mortal memory" of Andrew Jackson, who
on that day whippod the British ? Why, it
was only a cotton bale squabble compared
with Wilderness and Gettysburg. We do not
fancy the gunpowder anniversaries as a gen
eral thing, although we presume we shall not
ever feel like surrendering the Fourth of July.
It looks now as if we were about to contribute
our anniversary to the calendar of peace and
humanity by founding Thanksgiving Day.
This is the festival of home, even more than
Christmas. We observo that our American
exiles have carried it with them across the
sea, for our Berlin correspondent gives us an
account of a celebration in Berlin and an ad
dress by the Rev. Dr. Thompson, the well
known American clergyman, who represents
the religious interests of America in the Ger
man capital. The address is well worth
reading, and we are glad to note the celebra
tion as an evidence of the spread of an Amer
ican idea into other lands.
The Brooklyn Scindil.
Tho deep interest which people take in the
unfortunate controversy in Brooklyn makes it
really a national question. We follow it, from
time to time, not without the reserve which
journals should always obssrve in comment
ing upon legal proceedings. The Proctor
Moulton case has come to a sudden and un
expected close. There have been many
rumors about compromise, settlement and so
on, but no one expccted this abrupt termina
tion. At the same time we congratulate the
community upon the result It was a mistake
to bring the name of Miss Proctor into the
controversy. It was a mistake on the part
of Mr. Beecber's friends* to endeavor to
strengthen his case by an outside proceeding
directed against public opinion. The issue is
between Mr. Beecher and Mr. Tilton, or
rather between Mr. Beecher and the public
opinion of mankind. Any question, personal
or public, outside of that is an injury to Mr.
Beecher, an offence to that moral sense which
waits impatientlyfor the vindication of this
gifted and celebrated gentleman from the
horrible charges which are brought against
him.
As there could have been no motive?but
one so base that it is unworthy even of con
sideration?for the attack on Miss Proctor,
Mr. Moulton's counsel did a manly act in
making an apology. The mistake was in not
having made it earlier. It now seems to have
been given under duress and the fear of a
speedy trial and almoHt certain conviction.
The case is simplified. Is Mr. Beecher guilty
or not guilty of the terrible crimes laid to his
charge ? The sooner this is tried the better
for his fame, for morality, and for the peace
of the community. Any further delay in
avoiding the issue will be inexcusable, and
will injure no one so much as Mr. Beecher
himself. The motion of the defendant in
this case for a bill of particulars was
yesterday argued in the Brooklyn City
Court Mr. Tilton submitted an affidavit
setting forth his personal knowledge of
tho facts, but was not able to specify exact
times or places. Mr. Evarts and Mr. Morris
discussed the legal principles involved in the
motion, and Judge McCue reservod his de
cision.
Thus far in tho campaign there have been

Mr. Banes, the other in that against Mr.

Washington City.
Any measure for the proper government oi
Washington city would be welcomed by th*
country. We do not enter into tk* dntails of
Senator Morrill's bill, because they have not
yet been debated or maturely considered. As
we understand the proposition it is to bring
the capital immediately under the control of
the federal government, to be administered by
Congress very much as we administer publio
grounds and national reservations. The diffi
culties about Washington city are that it is an.
overnursed baby. Washington has many ele
ments of national growth, if it were only
allowed to grow. There is fine water power.,
a noble river, mineral deposits within easy
access, an agricultural country surrounds it
and it is within easy access of the sea. There
is no reason why, with the water power of tho
Potomac, Washington should not become
an important manufacturing centre; why,
in other words, it, like Philadelphia
or Baltimore, or Cincinnati, should not sup
port itself. There is no reason why there
should not be one hundred thousand people
in Washington living upon the industry and
manufactures of the city and independent of
the government. But the great trouble h**
been that the poople of Washington feel that
tho government owes them support Manu
factures have been made impossible because
the government pays larger wages and exacts
less service than any businoiv man could
afford. So the moment that a cotton mill or a
sugar refinery or an iron furnace is established
every laborer, after the first six months' em
ployment, finds that a watchman at the Capi
tol, who spends his time dozing against a
pillar, or a treasury porter, whose life is
given to a contemplation of the Potomac from
one of the windows, receives more money than
he earns. Accordingly he instinctively be
comes one of that enormous lobby which sur
rounds Congress and the departments, con
stantly begging for office.
The result is that Washington?and this'
we say in no offensive sense?has become a
city of statesmen and beggars. There is one
class who administer the government, another
who live upon it. But there is no enterprising
unofficial class, proud of the city, its prosperity,
its natural advantages, and resolved to develop
them. It was a mistake, we think, in ths
beginning, to build a city for a capital.
Great capitals arc part of great cities, and con
tribute to their prosperity. If Washington
could be let alone, and if there could be a civil
service introduced into the departments,
preventing this constant aggregation of th?
begging classes, there is no reason why it
should not grow as rapidly as Baltimore ot
New Orleans.
Diphtheria.?Two meetings were held yes
terday in relation to this dangerous disease,
which has been unusually prevalent of late.
One was of the Publio Health Association and
the other of the Medical Board of the Eastern
Dispensary. Some of the suggestions of the
physicians present, especially in rogard to
publio schoolrooms and tenement houses,
deserve to be promptly acted upon by ths
authorities.

As Mouiton never said more than that Beecher
said a certain thing about a lady, and as he does
not now say that Beecher did not say so, it Is dim
cult to see that all tbe array of counsel and formid
able parade or the case generally has changed
anything.

past Ave last evening, probably in obedience to
bis kind brother-in-law's reqnest.
