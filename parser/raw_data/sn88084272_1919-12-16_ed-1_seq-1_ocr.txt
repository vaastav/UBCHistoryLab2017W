STRONG INFLUENCES ARE WORKING
FOR RATIFIGATIONOF PEACE PACT
President Wilson and Republican Leader Lodge Refuse
to Take Initiative But European Concessions and
Free Party Members Strong Enough to Bring
About Compromise, Public Growing Impatient.
By DAVID
WASHINGTON. D. C Dec. tf evi
dent Wilson himself dictated the
; ttement iued at the white house
s of The Highest Authority" to the
iftct that he had no more of cora
i.romise or concession in mind with
i eference to the status of the treaty
of peace.
Senator Lodge, Republican leader,
has insisted that he would not take
the initiative and each side blames
and holds the other responsible. On
tne surface this may seem like con
1 1 rmation of the fear of the per
manent deadlock between the execu
tive branches of the government. But
there are other factors and forces of
sufficient Influence and strength to
I rmg about a compromise.
In the first place, foreign govern
nerts have let it be known that some
.f the reservations will be accepted.
In the second place. Democrats and
Republicans who are not themselves
i-o closely committed bp the positions
. f their respective leaders are free to
tzo ahead and map out a compromise
and in the third place, the American
public is unquestionably impatient
:-a.t something be done to clear
i j i the confused status of America's
t -lations with Europe, as a conse
. jence of the war.
BvatBeas Wants Ratification.
The time is past when approval or
-.approval of president Wilson's
aLitement will do any good. It would
tke the supreme court of the United
States many mouths to fix the exact
T-fponsibihiy for the delay in the
veace treaty If the whole case wer
i ' ken into consideration from the day
-esident Wilson went abroad to the
.-mteinent issued by the president
tnlmly throwfiig off his own shoul
. e-3 all responsibility and carefully
i posing the same on the heads of his
i. position.
Who is responsible is of relatively
Ks importance today than what can
i'. don to relieve the suffering of

i i Timercial catastrophe on the other

have its effect in shutting

Inside - the administration dares

Democrats who can arrange a com

relieve both the president and senator

Is predicted on every side, a split in
the Republican ranks has been in evi

Johnson and Knox and their group

fraught with no political doing to

That in substance Is the view which
