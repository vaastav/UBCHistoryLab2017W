CONGRESS CONVENES.
Republicans Elect Speaker
Political Gossip of Interest
to Politicians.
Washington, Dec 4, 1899 -Hon
J. D. Richardson, of Tennessee, wno
? received the democratic nomination
for speaker, after one of the longest
caneases ever held, got the vote of
every democratic member of the ,
House tc day He was not, of]
course, elected ; the republicans
having the most votes, elected
Representative Henderson Speaker,
and adopted the old Reed rules,but Mr
Richardson wiii be the democratic
floor-leader of the house during the
life of the Fifty sixth congress
There m&y be more showy and
brilliant men on the democratic side
of the House, bat that he wiil make
a shrewd and safe leader is conceded
by all. His shrewdness would have
been shown by the manner in which
he conducted his campaign for the
nomination of Speaker, bad it not
been well established long ago He
received no warmer congratulations
cn his success than those extended
by his three rivals for the honor
LeaviDg Roberts and his polygamy
entirely oat of the question, the
position taken by the democrats in
the first scrap of the session, which
occurred when objection was raised
to the swearing in of Roberts, that
the boase had no right to go behind
the official returns and deny a man a
seat, when he presents proper cre?
dentials, was right, but right can't
win when a majority is determined to
do the other thing. If Roberts can
not clear himself of the charge of
having violated the law. there will
be few, if any, objections on the
democratic side to his being denied
a seat, but it is wrong to declare him I
guilty before his case is fairly invest
igated. <
Mr McKinley's long message
one cf the longest ever sent to con
gress-was not sent in today, owing
to the early adjournment of both
s?cate and bouse as a mark of
respect to the iate Vice President
Hobart. It will go in tomorrow, and
then the real business of the session
of congress will begin The demo
crats were never in a more aggress
ive mood, and "hot times'' are ahead
for the republican majority in both
senate and house.
The attention of senators is being
called to the fact that Gov Stone bad
no constitutional right to appoint Mr
Quay to the senate, after the legisla?
ture adjourned, without electing hie
successor The State constitution of
Pennsylvania expressly provides that
vacancies in the United States sen
ate sbaii only be filled by the legisla
ture. A number of influential Penn
sylvanians are in Washington work?
ing against the seating of Quay on
personal grounds, against both
precedent and law One of these is
ex-Represeniative Sowden, who said
cn the subject : "The question
should not be made a partisan one,
but each senator, legardiees of his
politics or &is personal ftiendship for
Mr Quay, should vote as a conscien
tioos, impartial and upright judge,
and decide it according to its merits
and the dictates of his own con
science, under his official oath, if
this be done, there can be no ques
?ion of the result Gov Stoned
unlawful appointment has not a
siDgle merit to support it "
That our pension laws are in need
of revision, everybody knows, but
when they will get it, or whether the
revision will majke them better or
woree, is a horse of another color
The secretary and assistant secretary
of the interior, and the commissioner
and assistant commissioner of pen
8?OD8, have testified before a sub
committee, of the senate committee
on pensions, that a revision of the
laws should be made, and recom?
mended that it be done by a non
partisan commission A ?national
commission that is reaiiy non partisan

Hobart's Death, K c.
WASHINGTON, Bec. ?.-The president
today transmitted to congress his an?
nual message, as follows:
To the SenaLe and House of Represen?
tatives:
At the threshold of your deliberations
you are cailed to mourn with your coun?
trymen the death of Vice President Ho?
bart, who passed from tins life on the
morning of November 21st, last. His
great soul now rests in eternal peace.
His private iife was pure and elevated,
while his public career was ever distin?
guished by large capacity, stainless in?
tegrity and exalted motives. He has
been removed from the high office which
he honored and dignified, but his lotty
character, his devotion to duty, his hon?
esty of purpose and nobie virtues re?
main with us as a priceless legacy and
example.
The* Fifty-sixth congress convenes in
its first regular session with the country
in a condition of unusual prosperity, of
universal good will among the people at
home and in relations of peace and
friendship with every government of
the world. Our foreign commerce has
shown groat increase in volume and
value. The combined imports and ex?
ports for the year are the largest ever
shown by a single yoar in all our his?
tory. Our exDorts for lS9s) alone ex?
ceeded by more than ?1,000,000.000 our
imports and exports combined in 1S70.
The imports per capita are 1:0 per cent
less than in 1670, while the exports per
capita are 58 per cent more than in iS70,
showing the enlarged capacity of the
United States to satisfy the wants of its
own increasing population, as well as to
contribute to those of the peoples of
other nations.
Question of Trusts.
Combinations of capital organized
into trusts to control the conditions of
trade among our citizens, to stifle com?
petition, iimit production and determine
the prices of products used and con?
sumed by the people, are justly provok?
ing public discussion and should early
claim the attention or the c ongress.
The industrial commission created by
the act of congress of June IS, lS'JS, has
been engaged in extended hearings upon
the disputed questions involved in the
subject of combinations in restraint of
trade and competition. They have not
yet completed their investigations of
this subject and the conclusion and
recommendations at which they may
arrive are undetermined. The subject
is one giving rise to many divergent
views as to the nature and variety or
cause and exten t of the injuries to the
public which may result fruin large
combinations concentrating more or
less numerous enterprises and estalish
ments which previously to the forma?
tion of the combination were carried
separately.
It is universally conceded that combi?
nations which engross or control the
market of any particular kind of mer?
chandise or commodity necessary to the
general community, by suppressing nat?
ural and ordinary competition, whereby
prices are unduly enhanced to the gen?
eral consumer, are obnoxious not only
to the common lav.% but also to the pub?
lic welfare. There must be a remedy
for the evils involved in such organiza?
tions. Ii the present law can be ex?
tended more certainly to control cr
check these monopolies or trusts, it
should be done without delay. What?
ever power the congress posesses over
this most important subject should be
promptly ascertained and asserted.
It is apparent that uniformity of leg?
islation upon this subject in the several
states is much to be desired. It is to be
hoped that such uniformity founded in
a wise and just discrimination between
what is injurious and what is useful
and necessary in business operations
may be obtained and that means may
be found for the congress within the
limitations of its constitutional power
so as to supplement an effective code of
state legislation so to make a complete
system of laws throughout the United
States adequate to compel a general ob?
servance of the salutary rules to which
I have referred.
The whole question is so important
and farreaching ihat I am sure no part
of it will be lightly considered, but
every phase of it will have the studied
deliberation of congress resulting in
wise and judicious action.
Til?* Nicaragua Canal.
The Nicaragua canal commission,
which had been engaged upon the work
of examination and survey for a route
across Nicaragua, having completed its
labors and made its reports, was dis?
solved on May 31, aud on June 10 a new j
commission, known as the isthmian ?
canal commission, was organized under
the terms o:' the act approved March Z,
lbi)9. for the purpose of examining the !
American isthmus with a view to de- !
terminiui: the most practicable and j
feasible route for a ship canal across
that isthmus, with its probable cost and
other essential details.
This commission, under the presi?
dency of Rear Admiral John G. Wal
ker, U. 3. N.. retired, entered promptly j
?ipon the work intrusted tb it and is j
nov/ carrying on examinations in Nica- j
ragua along the route of the Panama
canal and in Darien from the Atlantic, j
from the neighborhood of the A trait o ;
river to the bay of Panama ou the Pa- i
cific side. Good progress has been *
made, but under the law a comnrehen- i
sive and complete investigation is called
for; which will require much labor and
considerable time for its accomplish- j
ment. The work will be prosecuted as
expeditiously as possible and a report
made at the earliest practicable date.
The great importance of this work
cannot be too often or too strongly i
pressed upon the attention of the con- j
gress. In my message ot' a year ago I j
expressed niv views of the necessity ot j
a canal which would link tiie two great i
oceans, to which i again invite your con- !
sideration. The reasons then presented
for eany action are i vea stronger now.
HOT-lin tish < oril <.;.
This government has maintained an !
attitude ot neutrality in the unfortu?
nate contest between Great Britain ;?ni
the Boer states of A' rica. We nave re?
mained faithful to the precept of avoid?
ing entangling alliances as to affairs j
not of our direct concern. Had cronin- ;
stances suggested that the parties to the j
quarrel would have welcomed any ?
kindly expression of the hope of
American people tba: war mi?rht
averred, good ornees would have bi
gla?ly tendered.
The United -?rates' representative
Pretoria was ear^y instructed to seer,
ail neutral American interests be
sneered by the combatants. This 3
been an easy task iu view of the pr
rive declarations of both British a
Boer authorities thar, tho personal a
property rights or our citizens shot
be observed.
Upon the withdrawal of the Brit
agent from Pretoria, the United Sta
consni was authorized, upon the requ
or the British governmont and with t
assent of the Sont ii African and Oran
Free State governments, to exercise t
customary good offices of a neutral :
the care of British interests. In the ci
charge of this function, I am happy
say that abundant opportunity has be
afforded to show the impartiality of ti
government toward both the comb
ants.
Cuban Administration.
My annual message of last year vi
necessarily devoted in great parc rt
consideration of the Spanish war a
of the results it wrought and the com
tions it imposed for the future. I z
gratified to announce that the treaty
peace has restored friendiv relations 1
tween the two powers. Effect has be
given to its important provisions. T
evacuation of Porto Rico having airea*
been accomplished on Oct. 18, ISi
nothing remained necessary there
continue the provisional military cc
trol of the island until the co
gress should enact a suitable gover
ment for the ceded territory. Of t
character and scope of the measures
that end I shall treat in another parc
this message.
The withdrawal of the authority
Spain from the island of Cuba was e
fected by Jan. 1, so thac the full re-e
tablishment of peace found the reli
quished territory held by us in trust f
the inhabitants, maintaining under tl
direction of the executive such gover
menc and control therein as should co
serve public order, restore the produ
tive conditions of peace so long di
curbed by the instability and disord
which prevailed for the greater part
the preceding three decades, and bui
np that tranquil development of the d
mestic state whereby alone can be rea
ized the high purpose as proclaimed i
the joint resolution adopted by the co:
gress on Aprii 19, l$9d, by which tl
United States disclaimed any dispos
tion or intention to exercise sovereignt;
jurisdiction or control over Cuba, e:
cept for the pacification thereof, and a
serted its derermination when that W?
accomplished to leave the governmei
and control of the island to its people.
The pledge contained in this resolt
tion is of the highest honorable oblig:
tion and must be sacredly kept. I b
lieve that substantial progress has bee
made in this direction. All the admii
istrative measures adopted in Cuba ha\
aimed to fit for a regenerated existenc
by enforcing the supremacv of law an
justice; by placing wherever practicabi
the machinery of ?dministration in tb
hands of the inhabitants; by institntin
needed sanitary reforms; by spreadin
education; by fostering industry an
trade; by inculcating public morality
and, in short, by raking every rations
step to aid the Cuban people to acrai
to that plane of seif conscious respec
and self reliant unity which fits an ec
lightened community for self go very
meut within irs own sphere, while en
abling it to fulfill all outward oblig.i
tions.
Philippines Problem.
On the 10th of D>c3:nb?r, th
treaty of peac.i between the Unite*
States and Spain was signed. Ir prc
viced, arnon:: orher things, tba: Span
should cede io the United States th
archipelago known as the Phiiippim
islands; that the Uu:;ed States shouh
pay to Spain the sum of twenty million
of dollars, and thar the civil rights ant
political status of the native inhabitant
of the territories thus ceded to th
United States should be determined bi
the congress. Tho treaty was ratifi?e
by the senate on the Otb. of February
1^99. and by the government of Spair
on the 19th of March following. Tnt
ratifications were exchanged on the 2 Iel
of April, and the treaty publicly pro
claimed. On the 2nd of March the con
gress voted the sum contemplated bj
the treaty and the amount was paie
over to the Spanish government on thc
1st of May.
In this manner the Philippines came
to the United States. The islands were
ceded by the government of Spain,
which had been in undisputed posses
sion of them for centuries. They wer?
accepted, not merely by our anthorized
agents in Paris under the direction ol
the executive, but by the constitutional
and well considered action of the repre?
sentatives of the people in both houses
of congress. I had every reason to be?
lieve, and I still believe, that this trans?
fer of sovereignty was in accordance
with the wishes and the aspirations 01
the great mass of the Filipino people.
From the earliest moment, no oppor?
tunity was lost of assuring the people
of the i-lands of our ardent desire for
their welfare, and or che intention of
this government to do everything pos?
sible to advance their interests.
Aguinaldo's Claim.
The olnini of tho rebel leader that he
was promised independence by any offi?
cer of the United Stares in return for
his assistance has no foundation in fact
and is categorically denied by the very
witnesses who were called to prove ir.
The most the insurgent leader hoped
for when he came to Manila was the
liberation of the island's from the Span?
ish control, which rhey^had been labor?
ing tor years without success to throw
off
The prompt accomplishment of this
work by the American army and navy
gave him other ideas and ambitions,
and insidious -Uir^esnons from, various
quarters tier verted the purposes and in?
tentions with which he iiad taken up
arms.
No sooner had oar army captured Ma?
nila than the Filipino forces began to
assume an attitude of suspicion and
hostility which the utmost efforts of
our officers and troops were unabie tc
disarm or modify. Their kindness and
forbearance were taken as a proof ol
cowardice. The aggressions of the Fili?
pinos continually increased until finailv,
jn<t before the time set by the senate o?
che United Stares fir a vote unon the
treaty; an attack, evidently prepared in
advance, was made ail aloii^ tin- Amer?
ican hues, which resulted :;i a terribly
destructive and sanguinary repulse o!
the rebels
With a devotion and ^aiiantrv worthv
of Ks mos: brilliant history, th" army,
ably and loyally assisted by the navy,
has carried on this unwelcome but mosl
rig: teou* campaign with richly de?
served success. Although their opera?
tions have been somewhat interrupted ;
and checked h. a raiuv season of uuu
j sr..! I violence and duration, th^y hay.' i
i ga.ned steadily m every direction and j
; now look forward confidently tu a s pee i y
! completion ot' tii-ir task.
Everything indicares that with the
j speedv suppression of the Tagalo rebe ?
li?n, hie in the archipelago '.."ill soon ;
: resume its ordinary courso under iii-.:
! protection o: our sovereignty and the
; people of those favored islands will en
! joy a prosperity and a freedom which
chev have never before known.
Cannot l?- Abandoned,
j The future government of the Philip- j
'? pines rests with the congress of the !
United ?tates. Fewer graver responsi- i
I bilmas have ever been con lid ed to us.
j If we accept them in a spirit worthy oi
i our race and our traditions a great op
I portuuitv comes with them.
The ibiands lie under the shelter of
! our ?a g. They are ours by every title
j or law and equity. They cannot be !
j abandoned Ir we desert them, we
leave tnem at once to anarchy and
fiuaiiy to barbarism. We fling them, a
golden apple of discord, among the rival
powers, no one of which could permit
another to seize them unquestioned.
Tneir rich plains and valleys would be
the scene of enaiess strife and blood
I shed.
The advent of Dewey's fleet in Ma
j niia bay instead of being, as we hope,
I the dawn of a new day ot freedom and
progress, will have been the beginning
of an era of misery and violence worse
tuan any which has darkened their un?
happy past.
The suggestion has been made that
we could renounce our authority over
the islands and giving them indepen?
dence could retain a protectorate over
them. This proposition will not be
found, I am sure, worthy of your seri?
ous attention. Such an arrangement
would invoive at the outset a cruel
breach of faith. It would place the
peaceable and loyal majority, who ask
for nothing better than to accept our
authority, at the mercy ot the minority
armed insurgents.
It would make us responsible for the
acts of the insurgent leaders and give
us no power to control them. It would
charge us with the task of protecting
them against each orner and defending
them against any foreign power with
which they chose to quarrel. In short,
it would take from the congress of the
United States the ,power of declaring
war and vest that tremendous preroga?
tive in the Tagal leader of the hour.
It does net seem desirable that I
should recommend at this time a spe?
cific and final form of government for
j these islands. When peace shall be re- !
stored it wiil be the duty of congress to j
construct a pian of government which j
shall establish and maintain freedom
and order and peace in the Philippines. 1
The insurrection is still existing and j
when it terminates further information
will be required as to the actual condi?
tion of affairs before inaugurating a
permanent scheme of civii government.
'Until congress shall have made known
the formal expression of its will, I shall
use the authority vested in me by the
constitution and the statutes to uphold
j the sovereignty of the United States in
I those distant islands, as in all other
I places where our flag rightfully floats,
j Our flag has never waived over any
: community but in blessing. I believe
j the Filipinos will soon recognize the
! fact that it has not lost its gift of bene
! diction in this worldwide journey to
j their shores.
Porto Rican Affairs.
I I recommend that legislation be had
I with r?f?ren?a to the government of
! Porto Rico. The time is ripe for the
? adoption of a temporary form of gov
! eminent for this island.
I* is desirable that the government of
j the island, under the law cf belligerent
! rijjht, now maintained through the es
. ecutive department, should be super- j
i seeled by an administration entirely
j civil in its nature. For the present pur
j pose I recommend that congress pass a
j law for the organization of a temporary
j government which shall provide for the
; appointment by the president, subject
j to confirmation by the senate, of a gov
I ernor and such other officers as the gen
! eral administration of the island may
j require and for legislative purposes, on
j subjects of a local nature not partaking
of a federal character.
A legislative council, composed partly
of Porto Ricans and partly of citizens
of the United States, shall be nominated
and appointed by the president.
Lynch Law Condemned.
The love of law and the sense of obe?
dience and submission to the lawfully
constituted judicial tribunals, are em?
bedded in the hearts of our people, and
any violation of these sentiments and
disregard of their obligations, justly
arouses public condemnation. The
guarantees of life, liberty, and of civil
rights, should be faithfully upheld, the
right of trial by jury respected and de
j fended.
Those who, in disregard of law and
the public peace, unwilling to await
the judgment of court and jury, consti?
tute themselves judges and executioners
should not escape the severest penalties
for their crimes.
Great Opportunities.
Presented to this congress are great I
opportunities; with them come great j
responsibilities. Toe power confided to
us increases the weight of our obliga?
tions to the people, and we must be pro?
foundly sensitive of them as we conten?- j
plate the new and grave problems which j
confront us. Aiming only at the pub- j
lie good, we cannot err. A right inter- i
pretation of the people's will, and of ?
duty, cannot fail to insure wise meas- j
ores for the welfare of the islands which I
have come under the authority of the ?
United States, and to iuure to the com- .
mon interest, and lasting honor of our j
conni ry. Never has this nation had
more abundant cause than during the ;
past year for thankfulness to God for ?
manifold blessings and mercies, for J
which we make reverent acknowledge !
