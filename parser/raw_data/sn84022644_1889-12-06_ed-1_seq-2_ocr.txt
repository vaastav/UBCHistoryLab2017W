la Troy, New York, a contest U going on
a to who wa elected acnator. The lox in
which Scaatotial ballot wern d? posi'.eil was
sealed at the cloe of the election by ('lacing
over the aperture a Senate ticket, When the
vote were counted it wa found that the Sen-
ale ticket had been torn from the box and
that a piece of while paper had been aubatitut
ed. In counting the ballot only S( vote
were Lund tat Jame C Roger, the Republi
can candidate fcr Senator, and 6 fcr I vac, the
Prohibition candidate, while there were nearly
9o fur Collin, the Democratic nominee.
Affidavits were presented from aeventy three
Republican ahowing that they had voted for
Soger and from eleven Prohibition:: s who
voted for It. Juatice Edward marred hi
deciiion, He taid, however, that if the a(B
davits presented were true a groaa crime had
been committed agatnat the elective franchise,
fie auggested that the matter be presented to
the Crand Jury for investigation. Thi appear
to be a caae of groaa fraud and it is to be hop
ed the guilty partita may be juetly punished.
Prohibition exists in Iowa only by yirtae of
aiitute law, and it ia not all unlikely that thi
law may be repealed by the Lag islature nest

iie, and the email republican legialative ma
jority, it is expected, will not ataad in the way.

the republican, it ia wcU known that tboua

to atop coining silver, and authorise him
to Issue treatury notes, (not a legal tender)

The whole plan should be denominated a
