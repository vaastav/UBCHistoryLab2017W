AGRICULTURAL OPPORTCXITT.
j uf .' how far froverciuemal dignity is compati
ble with advertisinp; is. perhaps, a? difficult to
determine as it Is to estimate the re.ii value of
pnr-b v course to the . ■ eniUMUI Tber^ are
facts vrhich the government might profitably dis
seminate through the medium of pai-i advertlse
rcer.ts. but the selection of mediums would re
quire an extraordinary endowment of tact and
discretion. At least two foreign governments,
b<nv«?v*»r. nre now or have been advertising in the
American press, presumably with pood results.
Not even th* 1 unprecedented movement of for
eign Immigrants to tins country has been of
pre;npr Interest to our people than the migration
of the best of our own agricultural population to
the wheat fields of Canada. From some of tbe
Western stares this movement has '''i l so great
as to account largely for their stationary posi
tion In respect to population. lowa has been the
grejiten sufferer through this migration of farm
ers from hijrh prk-ed lands to the comparatively
Inexpensive acres of the Northwest." Heal estate
agents have d<*ne their art, yet the force of
their BTguments has l»eeu augmented by the ad
vertisements which the Canadian iwwerniiieni
has published in our agricultural newspapers.
But while ourowii unoccupied lands navel
to *o great an extent taken up in the last quarter
of a century, i!,.-,. are still fine opportunities for
profit to American bushandmen without their
abandoning the country of their fathers or en
during the rij.">ri> of a Canadian winter. This
government is engaged In great reclamation
projects iv the West, and while a natural rain
fall' i« doubtless desirable. Irrigation likewise
offers many advantages nnd obviates the dauger
of drouth which every farmer irtistii^ to the
natural rainfall faces. In nearness In markets
and tnnisjmrt.il km facilities Tin>s<« lands . re far
more attractive than the lonely i>rnlries of the
far uortnw,>«:.
The traveller in tbe South who possesses any
familiarity with agriculture cannot fail to be
etrurk with the opportunities offered there to
oiei^etic men. The lands are cheap Slid fertile^
tbe climate is excellent, tbe people lire hospita
ble^ the ujarkcts bear and tr:m?pcruition facili
ties good. Tb*> IntclUgent people" of tbe South
welcome Xmhern immigrants, and the saaeral
attitude Is that of the old Confederate soldier
who BaM : "The people of the North came down
"here years ago and destroyed cur country: we
"need them now to build it up." And he cited
instances of success achieved by Northern people
to prove that his own state was, for the farmer
in a thickly settled community where property
values were high, the land of opportunity. His
only criticism of his section was that Mature was
too kind, th.it people were likely to lose their
energy because they could make a living with so
little effort.
Even New York State lias been attracting the
■Mai of Its emigrants from the states it helped
to populate a third of a century ago, and many
a young man is making a good- living from the
farm his father left when Western land was
cheap and plentiful. The government may well
;!<=k why "Intelligent, well-to-do farmers from
"the Mississippi Valley continue to flock to the
"Canadian wilderness to take up homes under ■
"foreign flag" while so many attractive oppor
tunities still remain in this country. The an
swer probably Is that the advantages of the
places nearer home are not brought so forcibly
to the attention of farmers who feel an Impulse
to move, with the result that Canada is getting
thousands of our best citizens.
MR. TAFT OS RBVISIOV.
Mr. Taffs speech at the Ohio Society dinner
showed how thoroughly in earnest he is in
regard to tariff revision. "It is better." he snid,
"that we have no revision at ell. that we allow
• the bill to be defeated, unless we are goiug to
"honestly revise the tariff on the basis I have
•explained: on the basis set down in the plat
"form." Those word? contain •nn intimation of
the length to which the President-elect is pre
pared to go in .Tder io secure for the people
the kind of revision for which they voted. The
basis which Mr. Taft explained was thlp: It
must be no mere "surface" revision, but it must
carry out as nearly as possible the provisions
of the platform. There must be an honest ef
fort to find out exactly what protection Amer
ican industries need, and give them just that
degree of protection, no more and no less.
Where the present rates ex<ee;i the difference
between the cost of production hen* and abroad
plus a "reasonable profit." they give an oppor
tunity to make "*an excess above the just
profit" and they should be cut accordingly.
The people who voted for Mr. Taft will un
doubtedly approve tariff revision in that spirit.
They want the schedule? revised in the inter
ests of the country at large and not in the in
t«»rp«ts of their beneficiaries alone. They are
with Mr. Taft when he says that it is better to
have no revision than one which leaves In the
hands of protected manufacturers the possibility
of demanding what he calls "an excess above a
j«Bt profit." which affects the consumer In the
form of an overcharge for the product. For
eign competition should be invited just at the
point where the producer, paying the higher
cost of produHnz in this country such commodi
ties as it costs more to produce here, can ob
tain a fair and reasonable profit. Below that
point foreign competition should be excluded;
above that point it should, if possibl?, be se
cured.
JUGGUKG WITH THE DEBT LIMIT
The special report of the Chart <n- Revision
Commission throws light on the reason why no
two persons agree as to the amount of the city
debt In reckoning the city's borrowing capacity.
The laws are not explicit rs to what elements
should be included in the d^bt f<>r that purpose,
and even where they are elf»nr the amount of
the city's liabilities in some instances can only
b^ estimated, and estimates differ. The Charter
Revision Commission finds the city debt $29,343,
'.t.'C larger than Mr. Metz's figures make it. the
chief item of difference l>e:ng the city's liability
for land acquired. This is in general land con
demned, but whose value has not yet been fixed
by condemnation proceedings. Obviously the
coal >'f such land to the cit> is a matter of con
jecture. Mr. Meta has included the city's lia
bility for it m the city debt on the basis of its
assessed valuation. Now. clearly pnoueh. this is
to<> low. I. rind always costs the rjty more than
its assessed value. Moreover, hasn't Mr. M^tz
himself regaled the public often with stories of
the cost of condemnation proceedings'? Y^t he
makes no allowance for this outlay as a }•:* rr of
the liabilities (Or land. From these considera
tions the commission reaches the conclusion that
the Controller's estimate of the city's liabilities
for land acquired is too low py $2&500.000.
j Since the Controller has nlways used the as
sessed valuation as rhf> measure of liability, there,
seems to be little reason for doubt that the city
g iver Its debt limit during the earlier half of
this rear, when the Controller figured it to be
within the limit by the narrow margin of only a.
million or two.
The recommendation of the charter < < ommis
si"u that the law regarding the items to he in-
I in the city debt for the purpose of reck
onlng its borrowing capacity should be made
explicit and detailed U eminently judicious.
TIIF TURKISH PARLIAMEXT.
It would he rasli to predict with entire confi
dence 'he result of the supremely interesting
experiment which was begun yesterday at the
Doima Baghtche palace, but at lenst it may be
said that there is as much reason for hope as
for doubt. We might, indeed, say more than that.
tbarvthere Is much reason for h^-^e, and for some
degree of confidence that, however many diffi
- may be encountered and however many
temporary defeats may be suffered, the procr»>s
which has begun in the Ottoman Empire will
continue and the ends which are now aimed at
will be attained. Such an estimate of the situa
tion is prescribed by ordinary faith in humanity
and in the continuance and ultimate triumph of
civilization. We cannot believe that a move
ment so well conceived, so benevolently Intended,
so well conducted and so necessary for the wel
fare of many million? of our race can 1>- doomed
to failure
There is. moreover, the encouraging example of
various other lands in which similar under>:
tnkings are slowly but surely prospering, despite
circumstances actually more adverse than those
in the Ottoman Empire. There were those who
scorned the notion of the permanence and efii
elency of the Russian Douma, and yet that body
is now an established and potent force, Is re
spectfully consulted by the Russian Treasury
and the Russian Foreign Office, and its ratifica
tion is conceded to be essential to the validity of
their most Important acts. The outlook for a
constitution In Persia has seemed dubious, and
at one time the Shah actually repudiated his
promise and decreed a return to absolutism, but
that repudiation had to be recanted, and Iran is
still on the road to constitutional and representa
live government. Ths suggestion of an elective
parliament and representative constitutional
government In China would a few years n^o
have seemed rtoptan, but to-day Its realization
is practically assured. We cannot believe that
the same experiment will rail In Turkey, where
the capacity and the readiness for self-govern
ment are probably greater than In any other of
these countries.
We have mentioned the good coudacl of the
movement thus far. Nothing could be more ad
mirable than the deportment both of the reform
ers who compelled the Turkish revolution and of
the sovereign who united with their demands.
The former have displayed no undue baste and
no extreme radicalism, in some regions, it is
true, the peasants have conceived the notion
that the new era means that no more taxes are
to be paid, and in Constantinople itself there are
those who saeau to Imagine that now there are
ivi longer any laws to he obeyed Hut the Young

minished respect for law. As for the Sultan, he
baa Shown not even a momentary symptom of
withdrawing from the advanced and enlightened
attitude which be assumed last summer, and his
free and almost unguarded appearances among
the people indicate a personal transformation as
marked as that which baa been effected in the
government.
The composition of the Chamber of Deputies
Is. as we have already observed, representative
of the various peoples of the empire Bttlgar and
Serb. Greek and Jew; Arnaut and Kutzo-Vlach,
Armenian and Arab, as well as Ottoman Turk.
The Senate, too. appointed by the Sultan, is simi
larly representative, containing Bulgars. Greeks,
Armenians and Jews, and even one Christian
bishop. But in patriotic purpose the entire as
sembly will be Ottoman, and it will undoubtedly
be under the political hegemony of the Young
Turks, who form its plurality party, and will be
directed in its deliberations by them with the
same rare prudence, moderation and resolution
which have marked their campaign for the es
tablishment of such a government. The great
square of St Sophia, with its marvellous pano
rama of Propontis and Bosporus, has witnessed
many stirring Incidents since the days of the
Eastern C»-sars. but probably none more gratify
ing or more auspicious of pood for humanity
than that of yesterday.
BRICKS WITHOUT STRAW. . .
The Democratic party does not regard th«
opportunity to be safe and sane four years hen"«
with any enthusiasm. It tried being cafe and
sane only recently and found there was "nothing
in it." Therefore Mr. McCarren, Mr. Guffey,
Mr. Roger Sullivan and the others who would
make it over again into a party in which "th«
better element" would feel perfectly at home an
meeting only with apathy and indifference. It is
apparent that 1906 Is a different year from 1000,
before the Democracy had been disillusionized
■ about the advantages of sanity.
To increase the nervousness of Mr. MeCarren
and his associates over the indifference of the
party to its situation "The Springfield Repub
lican" recalls what happened In the Whig party
after Henry Clay had suffered his third defeat.
When the next national , convention occurred, in
1848, the first ballot resulted as follows: Zachary
Taylor, of Louisiana. Ill: Henry Clay, of Ken
tucky, 97; Winfleld Scott, of New Jersey, J.". ;
Daniel Webster, of Massachusetts. 22: John Mc-
Lean, of Ohio, '-': John M. Clayton, of Delaware.
4. Apparently only the fact that the Mexican
War had produced a soldier candidate for the
Whigs prevented the thrice defeated Henry Clay
from receiving his fourth nomination.
If circumstances favor the Democratic party,
a national figure may emerge from its ranks
during the coming four years. If it continue?
to develop only such political dwarfs as it has
developed for more than a decade, Mr. Bryan
will continue its dominating personality, who can
be displaced, undoubtedly, but without advan
tage to the party. The Democracy cannot make
bricks without straw.
UNIVERSITY COSMOPOLITANISM.
The present remarkable ' movement toward
cosmopolitanism In universities in respect to
both the instructors and the students is logical.
There is a correlation of significance between
the very words university and cosmopolitan. If
the institution aims to give instruction, in all
things, it will need the services of a variety of
Instructors, of whom it should secure the best
obtainable from whatever land; and it is fit
ting that its privileges should be available to
all who are competent and who desire to take
advantage of them from whatever land. This
practice is. indeed, no new thing, save In
its rapid and great expansion. Centuries ago
students went from one country to seats of
learning'in another, and great teachers were by
no means confined in their activities to thfir
own lands.
Lmi*: f!jr>> it was a common practice for young
Americans to go abroad for study at European
universities, at a time when our own Institu
tions were not so well equipped as they ure n< w
and when it was almost necessary to study in
Europe in order to attain the highest grade of
scholarship. There is less need of such a nimo
ment to-day, if. indeed, there is any general
need of it: but The movement shows n<> s :n
of being abandoned. American students form
an appreciable and Increasing element at ma iy
great Continental universities, while the monu
mental munificence of Cecil Rhodes has assured
In perpetuity the attendance of ■ lnrce numl t
;it <>xf"rd. Meantime ;i corresponding move
ment in the other direction has become mani
fest. Many European students now come to
American institutions, and are likely t<> •^
sn doing in Increasing numbers, while lar^
tineents yearly arrive from Japan and China,
both nn private Initiative and under govern
mental patronage, so that oar own universli es
.iro becoming as cosmopolitan as these of the
Old World.
Nor is cosmopolitanism In the teaching stiff
a new thing, as recollections of Agassiz and Da
pout" and Goldwtn Smith and James M I ■■
and others gratefully remind us. Of late it l as
assumed B new form, not as a substitute for
bur in addition to the old form, in tempori ry
exchanges of university lecturers. A few years
npo such relations wore established between
France and America and between Germany and
America, and these have been productive of
results which are substantially beneficent,
though at times some diversion has been caused
by the nnive seal of the respective propa
gandists of those rival countries In cultivat nc
American favor. No harm has been done by
such Imaginings, but there Is nothing but dis
appointment in store for Those who suppose
that the public sentiment of This nation is to
be swayed or The diplomatic policy of this ltov
ernment is to be influenced through Itinerary
university lectureships.
It is interesting To observe That these ex

CHINESE EUPHEMISMS
From The Dundee Advertiser.
One ■ asa of Chinese at least will sincerely mourn
the Emperor's death— the barbers. For otv inin
<lr<-<i days after the proclamation of tin* death no
one is nllnwf-<l to shave the front part of Hie head.
Tlm v people gel a close shave as 'soon as they
hear of the death. In mom parts of China blue Is
the mourning color The Emperor, In Chinese for
mal language, I? not allowed i.) "die" like other
people. He "crashes." A | in. • is said to "de
irils<\" ministers of state to "stop," omYlals to "re

The same love of euphemism shows Itself In other
ways. A coOn l! ' i ok. ii of hr "the timber of age"

mons, will make an address at the next meeting.
January 12, of the Civic Forum, which was opened
for the second season on Wednesday evening with
an address by President Eilot. The Rev. l>r.
Charles F. Aked. who has for years been
friend of Mr. Hardie. wiil preside. The sol '
the address will be "A Revolution In Brit
ln-p and Its Lessons for America." Mr. Hardie
comes to America solely on the invitation of the
Forum, and will remain in this country only ten
dn;.=. This will be his only public address in New
York The announcement of subsequent meetings
will be made later.
The • 'ivic Forum was established a year ago to
provide a n«'n-parusan, non-sectarian platform in
New York City for the public discussion of Impor
tant political, educational and economic questions
by distinguished speakers. The aim was ais.-> to
promote international good will by inviting eminent
foreigners to visit this country and speak under
the Forum's auspices. Last year ten meetings were
held, a.ldressed by such mer. as l»raaaitTit elect
Taft. William Jennings Bryan. Judge David J.
Brewer, of the United States Supreme Court: Gov
err&r Hughes of New York. Governor Fi!k of Mis
souri and Senator Knox. of Pennsylvania. Pro
feseor Pnul Milyoukov, on invitation of the Forum,
came from St. Petersburg to New York f"r the
Bole purpose of making one address in Carnegie
Hall, remaining only three days In America. Pr.
Krederik Van Eeden, the foremost poet of Hol
land, who had never visited this country, ataa cans
over to address the Forum. Informal assurances
have been given which warrant the expectation
that next year at ieast two prominent Europeans
will sp^ak under the Forum's auspices.
The Civic Forum is an educational rather than a
reform organisation. It alms less to advocate spe
cific reforms and denounce specific evils than to
aid in creating In New York and throughout the
country an atmosphere of civic intelligence and
patriotism which will vitalize and make effective
and permanent all good work for the common wel
fare.
