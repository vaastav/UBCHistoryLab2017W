THE MESSAGE.
It is no longer "a departure from
preecdent" for the president to read
his messages to congress, as he has
followed this rule since he assumed
the office. In one notable respect,
however, the first annual message of
President Wilson does depart from
precedent. We have become accus
tomed to messages covering anywhere
from twenty thousand to thirty thou
sand words, and while the delivery
of this formidable document was a no
table event, it was a byword that no
one read it. Of course there were
some exceptions, but practically every
one was contented with a newspaper
summary, crowded into less than a
column. This message of President
Wilson takes less than three columns
of space, yet that seems ample to pre
sent the views of the executive upon
all the questions of national concern
discussed. Because of its brevity, to
begin with, this message is assured a
more extensive reading than has ever
been accorded such a document in the
past. And those who do read it will,
we feel sure, find themselves in gen
eral accord with the executive. Gen
erally speaking, the newspapers po
litically opposed to the president
agree that it is a remarkably able
document, but contend that with re
gard to some questions Mr. Wilson
did not go far enough, and that may
be said to summarize about all the
criticism offered. The message itself,
however, we believe answers that.
Undoubtedly the question uppermost
in the public mind at the moment is the
situation in Mexico. It is stated that
there can be no peace in the southern
republic until Heurta has surrendered
his usurped authority. What the dic
tator has set up is characterized as
a mere military despotism with hardly
a semblance of authority and having
forfeited the respect and moral sup
port of even those at one time willing
to see him succeed, he has become
completely isolated and the collapse is
not far away. "We shall not, I be
lieve," says the president in concluding
his discussion of this subject, "be
obliged to alter our policy of watchful
waiting. And then when the end
comes, we shall hope to see constitu
tional order restored in distressed
Mexico by the concert and energy of
such of her leaders as prefer the lib
erty of their people to their own am
bitions."
As to this a very few opposition pa
pers insist that the president should
have recommended "some action.
There is just the point. What action?
The scene changes in Mexico about
every day. A condition that exists
today may be supplanted by a totally
different one tomorrow. Who will sin
cerely say that the administration's
policy of watchful waiting while the
crumbling of the Huerta dictatorship
goes swiftly on is not a wiser and
better policy than armed invention?
Comes next in importance, at least so
far as we of Montana and the west
are concerned, the question of conser
vation, and the president's own policy
is best summarized in his own words
that "we must use the resources of
the country, not lock them up." Only
the fanatics among the conservation
ists can see any objection to that dec
laration.
The business world could only be
pleased with the recommendation that
the Sherman anti-trust law be allowed
to stand, but should be supplemented
in order to make every provision clear
and eliminate the debatable ground
that now surrounds the law.
The farmer must have an even
chance with other business men and
masters of enterprise, the president
_____
masters of enterprise, the president
_____
declares, and he urges that means
devised whereby the farmer may make
his credit constantly and easily avail
able. It is, he declares, from the
mines, the forests, the open valleys,
farms and ranches that the nation
draws the sources of life and pros
perity and he adds that without these
the streetB would be silent, the offices
deserted and every factory fallen in
to decay.
"And yet the farmer," he continues,
"does not stand upon the same foot
ing with the forester and the miner
in the market of credit. He is the ser
vant of the seasons. Nature deter
mines how long he must wait for his
crops. He may give his note, but the
season of maturity depends upon the
season when his crop matures and lies
at the gate of the market where his
products are sold. And the security
he gives is of a character not known
in the broker's office or as familiarly
as it might be on the counter of the
banker."
The fulfillment of all obligations to
dependencies is demanded and ulti
| mate independence for the Philippines
j is recommended.
Every citizen who is interested In
hi scountry should read the message,
which appears in full in this issue of
the Democrat.
THE SPFUGS.
Undoubtedly the Sprugs are right
in their systematic effort to curtail
the giving of useless gifts. We are
with them in that. Still there may be
some difference of opinion as to Just
what constitutes a useless gift. Up
to a certain point we can all agree, no
doubt. There has been some sugges
tion that such things as toys of all'
sorts, including dolls, come under the
head of useless gifts.
Giving is chiefly a matter of senti
mefit, not of business. A child is still
to be treated as a child and the great
aim at this season is to make the
child happy. Some have gone so far
as to argue that instead of giving the
tiny girl a doll or the little chap a red
wagon, we should deposit a couple of
dollars to the credit of each in some
savings bank, so that ideas of thrift
and so on may be inculcated and the
money not wasted on useless gifts.
The people who indulge in that sort
of talk must be so far removed from
knowledge of children tuat their own
childhood is not even remembered.
Our own view is that no gift that
makes the heart of a child to sing with
joy is a useless gift, the Sprugs to the
contrary notwithstanding.
EARLY SHOPPING.
The Christmas shopping has begun,
but it will not really be on "in full
blast" for a week. Then the rush will
begin. Our merchants are thoroughly
prepared to take care of the holiday
trade this season. Never before have
the stores carried such large, well se
lected and handsome stocks for the
Christmas season. The variety is be
wildering and surely all wants can be
met. After all, it's the early shopper
who fares best. The assortment to
choose from is larger, the stocks are
in better condition, the clerks have
more time to bestow than later on
during the rush and more satisfactory
selections can be made. "Do it now'"
is a pretty good motto for the Christ
mas shopper to adopt.
CRYING OVER LOST PIE.
Helena Independent: With hearty
approval and in heavy display type,
a number of g. o. p. newspapers around
Montana are publishing the complaint
of a Republican newspaper at Forsyth
because that publication has lost some
land office notices. The Missoulian
frequently emits a moan over the loss
of an office by some standpatter who
has been displaced by a Democrat.
No reference is made to the fact
that for 16 long years the Democrats
have remained outside the fence look
ing in on the political feast at which
sat only members of the faithful. They
do not call attention to the wholesale
decapitation of Democrats who had
been appointed to office by Grover
Cleveland. Sixteen years ago there
was no sympathy wasted on a Demo
crat who was let out of office when
he had perhaps only six months to
serve out his term. The crash of the
guillotine was heard day and night as
the official operator worked overtime
disposing of the un-elect and reward
ing the patriots. In later years when
it appeared likely that there might be
change in the political complexion
of the administration, Mr. Taft worked
valiantly appointing members of his
party to office and as quickly as pos
sible placing them under civil service.
Almost his last act before election was
to tow into a safe harbor all the ap
pointees possible, the idea being to
safeguard the g. o. p. members from
any tempest that might blow.
In the south, since civil service was
in force, it was usually the Republican
who got the office. It is stated that
practically 85 per cent of civil serv
ice employes in southern states, which
have never returned a Republican vote
to the electoral college, are members
of the g. o. p.
So it would seem as if the associated
order of Pie-Biters would cease wail
ing, if for no other reason than that
they may be accused of being poor
losers.
Along this line the comment of the
Roundup Tribuen of recent date is in
teresting:
"Verily, it makes a vast deal of dif
ference whose ox is gored. The late
political revolution has been prolific
of many interesting events, not the
least of which have been the heart
rending wails emitted by the organiza
tion attaches upon being divorced from
the "nourishment." After 16 years at
the pie counter, during which time a
spoils system absolutely perfect in its
workings had been perfected, the late
Republican organs of the eastern part
of the state are raising a tremendous
howl because the Miles City land of
fice officials have exercised their privi
lege of sending legal publications to
Democratic papers.
"During Republican rule it was im
possible for a Democratic paper to get
any of this work, which was frankly
recognized as "spoils of war." No par
ticular kick was raised by the Demo
cratic papers, and it is laughable in
the extreme to listen to the maledic
bejtions now being heaped on Democratic
officials for following the precedents
established by the Republicans them
selves. The Tribune would not, for
the world, intimate that the disposi
tion of federal patronage had any con
nection with the fact that during the
1912 campaign more than three-fourths
of the Montana newspapers were lined
up with the Republican organization,
but it is an interesting bit of history.
"In justice to the local Taft organ
it must be said that no howl was
raised when the new officials began
sending the land office notices to The
Tribune: as a matter of fact, the Rec
ord, in this instance, maintained the
attitude of a good loser—an attitude
which other Republican Bheets would
do well to emulate."

tal mistake when he attempted to dis
pose of the Glass-Owen currency bill
as a flat money bill.
Fiat money, as the congressman!
said, is irredeemable paper currency
that depends for its value simply upon!
the edict of the nation that issues it.
The term may be employed loosely as
it has been where there was an ele
ment of low and uncertain value in
addition to the edict, but no such back
ing is contemplated in the bill, and
the result is that the flat critic is not
taken seriously. He has hurt his own
cause by his too eager use of a catch
word for bringing the bill into disre-;
pute.
Mr. Glass cited other cases of alarms
that had no relation whatever to the
facts, and they will have the same ef-;
feet. The more the opposition resorts
to this kind of fighting the weaker it
will become. If its experts are guilty
of errors of judgment, ignorance
the facts or insincerity they cease to
appear as experts and their attacks
upon particular features of the bill
will receive less and less attention.
That is not the proper way to take
part in the passing of constructive leg
islation, but it may bring to the sup
and to decentralize
money power.
and diffuse the
port of the measure many persons
are attracted by its general purpose,
which, said the congressman, is to'it
give the^country^ an elastic ^currency

Washington, December 3, 1913.
President Wilson came over from
the White House yesterday afternoon
and delivered another message to con
gress. It was the fourth time that Mr.
Wilson has appeared before the two
houses in joint assemblage to discuss
the state of the union and to make
known his wishes in regard to matters
of legislation. The reception tendered
him yesterday was the most genuinely
cordial that he has been accorded.
There was wholly lacking the stilted
spirit of standoffishness which was
somewhat apparent upon the occasion
of his first visit. As a matter of fact,
the president has completely captured
congress. Even Jim Mann was im
pelled to express his unqualified ap
proval of the personally conducted
manner of placing presidential mes
sages before the lawmakers. Having
observed how popular the Wilson in
novation has become, those who are
opposed to this tradition-smashing pro
cedure remain discreetly silent on the
subject. It will be recalled that Wash
ington inaugurated the custom of ap
pearing before congress in person to
deliver his message. The example
thus set was followed by the second
president, John Adams, but when Jef
ferson became chief executive he dis
carded this practice and sent his mes
sages to congress by messenger. One
and perhaps the chief consideration
which induced Jefferson to switch the
system was his self-admitted deficien
cies as a public speaker. One of the
most prolific and powerful writers of
his day, the author of the Declaration
of Independence was an utter failure
as an orator. Then, too, political con
ditions were beginning to assume a
state of extreme turbulence about the
time that Jefferson became president.
There was the possibility that some
belligerent federalist might interrupt
the president during the reading of his
message and an unseemly squabble
thereby ensue. The plan thus adopt
ed by Jefferson was the fixed custom
irom that day until more than a cen
tury later, President Wilson went back
to first principles and, having found
that system satisfactory, has continued
it, and will probably, throughout the
course of his official career, appear in
person before congress with his mes
sages.
Under any circumstances, such an
occasion must be an impressive one,
and it appeared to me to be excep
tionally so yesterday. As is the usual
custom, the house convened at noon,
but quickly recessed until 12:45, when
the senators, headed by the vice-presi
dent, entered the house chamber and
occupied the seats that had been re
served for them, Vice-President Mar
shall taking his seat beside Speaker
Clark. The galleries were filled, but
profiting from the experience at the
first appearance of the president, when
several near-rlots were precipitated by
the hundreds who had crowded the
gallery floor, only those who held the
preious tickets were permitted to get
int> that part of the building. Prompt
ly it one o'clock the president was
ustered into the chamber by the joint
conmittee of senators and representa
tivis appointed for that purpose. As
j the president ascended the speaker's
! rosrum there was a grtat outburst of
apilause from the four-hundred-odd
menbers and the crowded galleries.
It vas evident that the president had
the approval of his audience from the
sta-t and the very unmistakably hearty
wecome visibly affected him. He was
] in ixcellent voice and every word that
he uttered could be distinctly heard
j in he farthest corners of the galleries.
Friquently, as he read, he was com
peled to suspend until outbursts of
apjlause had subsided,
Of the message itself, little need be
said here, since, doubtless, a large ma
of.joiity of the readers of this article
have read it in full. Although brief
as compared to the 20,000-word mes
sages to which the country became
aicustomed during the terms of recent
executives, it nevertheless covered a
vide scope and treated of a number
«f problems of the day with such
who,suscinctness as to leave no question
concerning the president's position,
to'it took an advanced position on such
momentous issues as Mexico, conser
vation and trust regulation and yet
there was an underlying note of con
servation which found a response in
the hearts of those, who, while urging
progress, deprecate revolution.
* * *
The people of the west must espe
cially appreciate and applaud that por
tion of the message which urged that
the great natural resources of the na
tion should be developed, instead of
being kept locked up and unused. It
was a distinct challenge to those ultra
conservationists who imagine that the
only way to conserve our resources is
to keep them forever under cover
through withdrawals and narrow bu
reaucratic restrictions. In the interest
of the farmers, the president urged
the speedy enactment into law of a
comprehensive agricultural system
whereby the credit of the farmer may
be as readily available as the wares
of the merchant or the paper of the
owner of stocks and bonds.
* * *
There is a gentleman in Mexico in
the person of one Victoriana Huerta
who probably got little satisfaction out
of the message, ff, indeed, he has had
the opportunity and inclination to
peruse it. The president did not mince
words in the least when he came to
discuss Victoriana. It is just possible,
of course, that Vic has not read the
message yet. From all accounts, the
Mexican dictator has been restoring to
a more or less popular method of for
getting the manifold difficulties .vhich
now beset him. In short, reliable re
port has it that Victoriana has been
trying to drown his sorrows and trib
ulations in the orthodox way and that
mescal, a beverage about ten times
the potency of Kentucky bourbon, has
constituted a substantial portion of
the general's liquid fare during the
past few weeks. With mescal acting
very efficient aid, General Car
ranza, the constitutionalist leader,
ought to be able to settle accounts
with Huerta very shortly.
* * *
The president has mapped out quite
an ambitious program for congress
and it does not require the services of
a seer to foretell that the present ses
sion is going to be an exceedingly busy
one up at this end of the avenue.
The senate will be engaged on the
currency bill for a fwe weeks yet, but
the Democratic leaders over there
have their dander up and have an
nounced that they will put through a
banking and currency bill before the
dawn of a new year. With that out
of the way, the decks will be cleared
for other legislation almost equally
far-reaching. One of the first things
to be taken up in the senate is the
Alaskan railroad bill, the purpose of
which will be to make possible the de
velopment of the immeasurable coal
fields of our northern possession. Sen
ator Walsh, who is a member of the
territories committee, from which that
bill will be reported, will be one of the
chief factors in the framing of thlB all
important piece of legislation and is
expected to be one of the bill's prin
cipal champions on the floor of the
senate. At present our country is an
nually purchasing several million dol
lars' worth of coal for our Pacific
coast fleet of battleships in Japan,
With the Alaskan coal fields opened
up, this money will be kept at home
and the saving in price will be suf
ficient to pay the cost of the proposed
railroad within two or three years. It
appeals to me that sort of conservation
is somewhat preferable to that of lock
ing up the coal fields of Alaska and
permitting them to remain indefinite
ly in that state.
Within another week it is expected
that the house will be down to work
in dead hard earnest and there will
be mighty little rest for those who
make it a practice to keep track of all
that is going on. The various com
mittees will get busy and there will
be a continuous round of fireworks on
to keep wide awake in order that thejrj
may take advantage of any slip which

to hold appropriations within reason

an economical administration, but it
is going to require a whole kennel of
watchdogs of the treasury to enable
us to make good on that promise. We
all believe in economizing up to a cer
tain point, said point being the boun
dry of our own district or state. After
we get within that boundry, we can
see so many splendid opportunities for
the wise expenditure of government
funds, so many meritorious projects
which should be financially aided and
abetted, so many thriving, growing
cities which need public buildings, so
many rivers which need dredging, so
many harbors to be scooped out, and
so on ad infinitum and to the final
farewell, that it is extremely difficult
for us to locate the exact spot at which
the pruning hook of economy should
be exercised. When you get four hun

very convenient one, and I must say
a somewhat logical one, in the fact
that the standard of statesmanship is
quite frequently fixed by the variety
