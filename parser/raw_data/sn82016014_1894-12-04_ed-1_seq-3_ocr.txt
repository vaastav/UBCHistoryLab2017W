"In the meantime, however, the fre
qnest presentation i f notes for redemp
tion iu trold by individuals anl institu
tions not desirine it for export, clearly
indicated tho existence of a feeling of
uneasiness in the public mini vhiie for
eign exchange was aimo.-t io;: tar.tlv at
or near a rate which uiaJe it more protita
bls to export g-ld than to purc;iae bills,
and subsequently withdrawals for ship
ment were daily threatened.
"In addition t these causes of anxiety
the vast accumulation of nmuy a", our
financial centers and the general de
pression in business which prevailed in
this country had so reduced the rates of
discount that the inducement to keep
funds abroad where better investments
could be made were much jf re -iter than
in ordinary times, and this, tcj-ether with
other facts stated, made it highly impru
dent to neglect any precaution which ap
peared necessary to insure the safety of
our linancial position. Therefore the
second issue of OU,OJO,000 was decided
upon.
"As the authority to issue and f-ell
bonds already exists, and the present
state of our iiuancial legislation compels
its occasional exercise; I repeat the
recommendation male in my last annual
report, that in the interest of the gov
ernment and people, power he conferred
upon the secretary of the treasury to
negotiate Ioan at a lower rate of inter
est and for a shorter time than are now
ai lowed.
Commenting on bis new plan for a
banking system which was ;iven in the
president's message yesterday, the secre
tary says:
"L'nder our present system so far as it
consists of notes issued by the United
States government, the volume of circu
lation was intended to be and is in fact,
unchangeable, it is unalterably tixed at a
certain amount and no matter how great
the emergency may be, it can neit ier
be enlarged nor diminished. The
only part of the currency possessing in
any degree the quality of elasticity is
that ot the national bunking association,
and it is now generally canceled, 1 be
lieve, that in this p iriicuiar at least, it
has failed to meet the requirements of
the situation at some of the most critical
periods in business affairs of the ooan
try." Light biscuit, delicious pastry, flaky
shortcake, appetizing rolls and minims,
and cat Hal griddle-cakes are made by
using Dr. Price's Baking Powder.
