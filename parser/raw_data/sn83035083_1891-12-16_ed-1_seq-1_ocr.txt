The " Christmas buying" is on again. How soon this
particular, time rolls around. All Christendom are begin
ning to talk and think " What shall we do for Christmas?"
It is an 'amusing study, if you will think of it, to
look over the " Special Announcements," " Grand Open
ings," Splendid Bargains," &c., &c, of the different deal
ers, at home and abroad, and notice the "Advice" " Sug
gestions," and the anxiety manifested by each, as to what
you should or should not buy. (Of course the advice so
freely given is entirely disinterested!)
The "Old Reliable" dealer in Strictly Useful and
Necessary eyeryday household articles will naturally
deprecate the useless expenditure of your wealth, for any
thing but his particular line of goods and so on through

more than for food and raiment? May be I am wrong
about it, but I believe there is much truth in it. A little
circumstance that occurred in our store a short time since
illustrates my idea pretty truly : A lady customer, accom

a woolen neck scarf from the liDe hurriedly, and remarked

THE MESSAGE.
A Lengthy State Paper by
President Harrison.
Washington, Deo. 9. The following
is the President' message:
To the Senate and House of Representatives:
The reports of the heads of the several execu
tive departments required by law to toe sub
mined to me, which are herewith transmitted
and the reports of the secretary ot treasury
and attorney general furnish a eomprehen
stye view of the administrative work of thi
last fiscal year relating to Internal affairs. Ii
would be ot great advantage if these re
ports could have an attentive perusal bj
every member of congress and by all who tak
an interest in publie affairs. Such a perusal
could not fall to excite a higher appreciation ol
the vast labor and conscientious effort, which
are given to the conduct of our civil adminis
tration.
The reports will, I believe, show that even
question has been approached, considered and
decided from the standpoint of public duty and
upon considerations affecting the publlo inter
ests alone. Again I invite to every branch ol
the service the attention and scrutiny of con
jtress. RECIPROCAL TRADE RELATIONS.
The work of the state department during the
last year has been characterized by sn unusual
Dumber of important negotiations and by dip
lomatio results of a notable and highly bene
ficial character. Among these are the recip
- rooal trade arrangements which have been con
cluded, in the exercise of the powers conferred
by seotlon 3 of the tariff law, with the republic
of Brazil, with Spain for its West India posses
sions, and with San Domingo. Like negotia
tions with other countries have boen much ad
vanced, and It is hoped that before the dose ot
the year further definitive trade arrangements
of great value will be oonoluded.
THE RIAL, FISHERIES DISPUTE.
In view of the reports which had been re
ceived as to the diminution of the seal herds in
the Bering Sea, I deemed it wise to propose to
her majesty's government in February last that
an agreement for a closed session should be i
made, pending the negotiations for arbitration j
wmon wen seemea to do approaching a favor
ble conclusion. After much correspondence,
nd delays for which this government was not
responsible, an agreement was reached and
signed on the Uth of June, by which Great
Britain undertook, from that date and until
May 1, 1893, to prohibit the killing by her sub
jects of seals in the Bering Sea, and the govern
ment of the United States during the same pe
riod, to enforce its existing prohibition atralnst
Selaglo sealing and to limit the catch by the Fur
eal company upon the Island to 7,500 skins. If
this agreement could have been reached earlier
in response to the strenuous endeavors of this
government It would have been more effective ;
but, coming even as late as it did, it unques
tionably resulted in greatly diminishing the
destruction of the seals by the Canadian seal
eries. In my last annual message I stated that
the basis of arbitration proposed by her majes
ty's government for the adjustment of the long
pending controversy as to the seal fisheries was
boi aooeptable. I am glad now to be able to
announoe that the terms are satisfactory to
this government, have been agreed upon, and an
agreement as to the arbitrators is all that is
necessary to the completion of the convention.
In view of the advanoed position which this
government has taken upon the subjeot of in
ternational arbitration, this renewed expression
of our adherence to this method for settlement
of disputes such as have arisen in the Bering
Sea win, I doubt not, meet with the oonour
renoe of Congress.
OCR BOUNDARIES.
Provision should be made for a joint demar
cation of the frontier line between Canada and
the United States wherever required by the
increasing ooraer settlements, ana especially
for the exact location of the water boundary in
the straits and rivers.
OPENED TO AMERICAN MEATS.
The law of the last congress providing a sys
tem of inspeotlon for our meats intended for
export and clothing the president with power
to exclude foreign produots from our market in
case the country sending them should perpetu
ate unjust discriminations against any product
of the United States, placed this government
in a position to effectually urge the removal
ot auch discriminations against our meats.
It is gratifying to be able to state that Ger
many, Denmark, Italy, Austria and France, in
the order named, have opened their ports to
inspected American pork produots. The re
moval of these restrictions in every instance
was asked for and given solely upon the ground
that we had now provided a meat inspection
that should be accepted as adequate to the
-complete removal of the dangers, real or fan-
l oled. jwhlch has been jreviouslyjsrgeiL .The
State department, our ministers abroad, and
the secretary of agrioulture have co-operated
with unflagging and Intelligent zeal for the ac
complishment of this great result. The out
lines cof an agreement have been reaohed
with Germany, looking to equitable trade
ooDoesslons in consideration of the continued
free importation ot her sugars, but the time
has not yet arrived when this correspondence
ean be submitted to congress.
THE TROUBLES IN BRAZIL.
The reoent political disturbances in Brazil
have exalted regret and solicitude. The in
formation we.possessed was too meager to en
able us to form a satisfactory judgment of the
causes leading to the temporary assumption of
supreme power by President Fonseca, but this
government did not fail to express to him its
anxious solloitude for the peace of Brazil and
for the maintenance of the free political insti
tutions which had recently been established
there, nor to offer our advice that great moder
ation should be observed in the clash ot parties
and the contest for leadership. These coun
sels were received in the most friendly spirit.
and the latest information is that constitu
tional government has been reestablished
without bloodshed.
B THE NEW ORLEANS LYNCHING.
The lynohing at New Orleans in March last
of eleven men of Italian nativity by a mob of
citizens was a most deplorable and discredit
able lnoident. It did not, however, have its
origin in any animosity to the Italian people.
nor in any disrespect to the government ot
Italy, with which our relations were of the most
friendly character. The fury of the mob was
directed against these men as the supposed
participants or accessories in the murder of a
city oftioer. I do not allude to this as mitigat
ing in any degree this offense against law and
humanity, but only as affeotlng the interna
tional Questions which arrow out of it. It was
once represented by the Italian minister that
several oi tnose wnose uvea naa oeen taken Dy
the mob were Italian subjects, and a demand
was made for the punishment ot the partici-
?iajsts and for an indemnity to the families of
hose who were killed. It is to be regretted
that the manner in which these claims
were presented was not such as to promote a
calm discussion of the questions involved ; but
this may well be attributed to the exoitement
and indignation which the crime naturally
evoked. The news ol this government
as to its obligations to foreigners domi
ciled here were fully stated in the correspond
ence, as well as its purpose to make an investi
gation of the affair with a view to determine
whether there were present any oircumstances
that oould, under such rules of duty as we had
indicated, create an obligation upon tne united
States. The temporary absence of a minister
plenipotentiary of Italy at this capital has re
tarded the further correspondence, but it is not
doubted that a friendly conclusion is attainable.
Some suggestions growing out ot this un
happy lnoident was worthy of the attention of
congress. It would, I believe, be entirely com
petent for congress to make offenses against the
treaty rights of foreigners domiciled in the
United States cognizable in the federal courts.
This has not. however, been doue. and the
federal officers and courts have no power in
such eases to intervene either for the protec
tion of a foreign citizen or for the punishment
of his slayers. It seems to me to follow in this
state of law. that the officers of the state
charged with police and judicial powers in such
eases must, in the consideration of internation
al questions, growing out of such incidents, be
regarded in such sense by federal agents as to
make this government answerable for their acts
in cases where it would be answerable if the
United States bad not the constitutional powei
to define and punish erimes against treaty
rights.
THE ITATA INCIDENT.
The civil war in Chile, whieh began in Janu
ary last, was continued, but fortunately with
infrequent and not important armed collisions,
until August 83, when the congressional foroes
landed near Valparaiso and, after a bloody en
gagement, captured the city. President Bal
maceda at once recognized that his cause was
lost, and a provisional government was speedi
ly established by the victorious party. Our
minister was promptly directed to recognize
and put himself in communication with this
?:overnment as soon as it shonld have estab
ished its de faoto character, whioh was done.
During the pendency of this civil contest
frequent indirect appeals were made to
this government to extend belligerent
rights to the insurgents and to give
audience to their representatives. This
was declined and that policy was pursued
throughout, which this government, when
wrenched bv civil war. so strenuously insisted
upon on the part of European nations. The
Itata, an armed vessel oommanded by a naval
offioer of the insurgent fleet, manned by its
sailors, and with soldiers on board, was seized
under process of the United States court at
Ran nineo. CaL. for a violation of our neutral
ity laws. While in the custody of an officer of
the oourt the vessel was forcibly wrested from
his control, and Dut to sea. It would have been
inconsistent with the dignity and self-respect
ot this government not to have insisted that the
ltata should oe returned to sua uiego w auiua
the judgment of the court. This was so clear
to tne junta oi me cuugreasiuum yoitj, cohm
lished at Iquique, that, before the arrival of the
I tat. a at. that port, the secretary of foreign re
lations of the provisional government decided
to read Admiral Brown commanding the United
States naval forces, a communication, from
which the following is an extract:-
'The provisional government has learned by
the cablegrams of the Associated Press that the
' transport Itata detained in San Diego by order
oi tne united states ior taKing va uoaru muui
tinns of war and in possession ot the marshal.
lett the port, carrying on board this official.
- who was landed at a point near the coast and
:then continued her voyage. If this
, news be correct this eovernment would deplore
' the oonduct ot the Itata and. as an evidence
that it is not disposed to support or agree to
the infraction ot the laws oi tne united tatates,
the underniirnnd takes advantage of the per
sonal relations vou have been good enough to
maintain with him since your arrival in this
port to declare to you that as soon as she is
within reach of our orders his government will
put the ltata, with the arms and munitions she
took on board at San Diego, at the disposition
of the Unite4 Staies,". - - -
A trial in the district court of the United
States, for the southern district of California
has recently resulted in a decision holding;
among other things, that, inasmuch as the Con
gressional party had not been recognized as a
belligerent, the acts done In its interest could
not be a violation of our neutrality laws. From
this judgment the United States has appealed,
not that the condemnation of the vessel is a
matter of importance, but that we may know
what the present state of our law is; for, if this
construction of the statute is correct, there is
Obvious necessity for revision and amendment.
During the progress of the war in Chile this
government tendered its good offices to bring
about a peaceful adjustment, and it was at one
time hoped that a good result might be
reached, but in this we were disappointed.
The Instructions to our naval officers and to
our minister at Santiago, from the first to the
last of this struggle, enjoined upon them the
most Impartial treatment and absolute non
interference. I am satisfied that these instruc
tions were observed, that our representatives
were always watchful to use their influence
Impartially in the interest ef humanity and. on
more than one oocaslon, did so effectively. We
could not forget, however, that this govern
ment was in diplomatic relations with the
then established government of Chile as it is
now in such relations with the successor of
that government. I am quite sure that Presi
dent Montt, who has, under oircumstances of
promise for the peace of Chile been Installed as
president of that republic, will not desire that
in the unfortunate event of any revolt against
his authority the policy of this government
should be other than that which we have re
cently observed. No official complaint of the
conduct of our minister or of our naval officers
during the struggle has been presented to this
government, and it is a matter of regret that
so many of our own people should have given
ear to unofficial charges and complaints that
manifestly had their origin in rival interests
and in a wish to pervert the relations
of the United States with Chile.
THE COLLAPSE Ol" THE GOVERNMENT OF BAL
MACEDA brought about a condition which is unfortunate
ly too familiar in the history of the
Central and South American states. With the
overthrow of the Balmaceda government, ho
and many of his councillors and officers became
at once fugitives for their lives and appealed to
the commanding offloers of the foreign naval
vessels In the harbor of Valparaiso and to the
resident foreign ministers at Santiago for
asylum. This asylum was freely given, accord
ing to my information, by the naval vessels of
several foreign powers and by several of the
legations at Santiago. The American minister,
as well as his colleagues, acting upon the
impulses of humanity, extended asylum to
political refugees whose lives were in peril. I
have not been willing to direct the surrender of
such of these prisoners as are still in the Amer
can legation without suitable conditions. It
is believed that the government of Chile is not
in a position, in view of the precedents with
which it has been connected, to broadly deny
the right of asylum, and the correspondence
has not thus far presented any such denial.
The treatment of our minister for a time was
such as to call for a decided protest, and it was
very gratifying to observe that unfriendly
measures, which were undoubtedly the result
of the prevailing exoitement, were at once re
scinded or suitably relaxed.
THE ASSAULT ON AMERICAN SAILORS AT VAL
PARAISO. On the 16th of Ootober an event occurred in
Valparaiso so serious and tragio in its circum
stances and results as to very justly excite the
indignation of our people and to call for prompt
and decided action on the part of this govern
ment. . A considerable number of the sailors of
the United States steamship Baltimore, then
in the harbor of Valparaiso, being upon shore
leave and unarmed, were assaulted by armed
men nearly simultaneously in different locali
ties in the city. One petty officer was
killed outright and seven or eight sea
men were seriously wounded, one of
whom has since died. So savage and brutal
was the assault that several of our sailors
reoeived more than two, and one as many as
eighteen stab wounds. An investigation of the
affair was promptly made by a board ot officers
of the Baltimore, and their report shows that
these assaults were unprovoked, that our men
were conducting themselves in a peaceable and
orderly manner, ana tnat some ol the police of
the city took part in the assault and used their
weapons with fatal effect, while a few others
endeavored to protect our men. Thirty-six of
our sauors were arrested, ana some oi them.
while being taken to prison, were cruelly
beaten and maltreated. The fact that they
were ail aiscnargea, no criminal cnarge being
lodged against any one of them, shows very
clearly that tney were innocent of any breach
oi tne peace, so lar as l nave been
able to learn no other explanation of this
bloody work has been suggested than that it had
its origin in hostility to these men as sailors of
the United States, wearing the uniform of their
government, and not in any individual act or
personal animosity. The attention of the
Chilean government was at onee called to this
affair, and a statement of the facts obtained by
the investigation we had conducted was sub
mitted, accompanied Dy a request to De advised
of any other or qualifying f aots in the posses
sion of the Chilean government that might tend
to relieve this aaaiT of the appearance of an in
sult to this government. The Chilean govern
ment was also advised tnat it such qualify
ing facts did not exist this government
would confidently expect full and prompt
reparation. It is to be regretted that
the reply of the secretary for foreign affairs
of the provisional government was couched iu
an offensive tone. To this no response has been 1
made. This government is now awaiting tha
result of an investigation which has been con
ducted by the criminal court at Valparaiso. It
is reported unomcially that the investigation is
about completed, and it is expeoted that the
result will soon be communicated to this gov
ernment, together with some adequate satisfac
tory response to the note by which the atten
tion oi cniie was caiiea to tms moment, ii
these just expectations should be disappointed
speoial message, bring this matter again to the
attention ot congress for such aotion as may be
necessary. The entire correspondence with the
government of Chile will at an early date be
suDmiiteu to congress.
THE SPANISH EXPOSITION.
The government and people of Spain propose
to celebrate the four hundredth anniversary of
the discovery ot America by holding the exposi
tion at Madrid, which will open on the lath of
September ana continue until tne a 1st of De
cember, 1893. -A cordial invitation has been ex
tended to the united states to t!te part in tms
commemoration, ana, as spam was one oi the
first nations to express the intention to par
ticipate in the world's fair at Chicago, it would
be very appropriate for this government to give
this invitation its friendly promotion.
RELATIONS WITH CHINA.
The late outbreak against foreigners in va
rious parts of the Chinese empire has been a
cause of deep concern in view oi tne numerous
establishments of our citizens in the interior of
that country. This government oau do no less
than insist upon a oontinuance of the protective
and punitary measures trhich tlje Chinese gov
ernment has heretofore applied. No effort
will be omitted to protect our citizens peace
ably sojourning in China, but recent unofficial
information indicates that what was at first re-
?;arded as an outbreak ef mob violence against
oreigners has assumed the larger form of an
insurrection against pnbilo order.
The Chinese government nas aecunea to re
ceive Mr. Blair as the minister of the United
States on the ground that, as a participant,
while a senator. In the enactment ot the exist
ing legislation against the introduction of Chi
nese laborers, he has become unfriendly and
objeotionable to China. I have felt constrained
to point out to tne jninese goveruiiieini tuo ua-
tenableness of this position, which seems to
rest as much on the unacceptabllity of our leg
islation as on that ot the person chosen.
ARBITRATION.
The arbitration treaty formulated by the in
ternational American oouference lapsed by
reason of the failure to exchange ratifications
fully within the limit of time provided, out sev
eral of the governments concerned have ex
pressed a desire to save this important result
of the conference by an extension of the period.
It is, in my judgment, incumbent upon the
United States to conserve the initiative it has
taken in this measure by ratifying the instru
ment and bv advocating the proposed exten-
tlon of the time for exchange. These views
have been made known to the other signatories.
REGARDING JEWISH PERSECUTION IN RUSSIA.
This government has found occasion to ex-
Tira. In a friendlv spirit, but with much earn
estness, to tne government oi tne czar, us
HAriniiK concern because of the harsh measures
now being enforced against the Hebrews in
Kussia. By the revival of anti-semitio laws.
long In abeyance, great numbers of those unior
tunate people have been constrained to aban
don their homes and leave the empire by reasun
of tho impossibility of finding subsistence
within the pale to which it is sought to confine
them. The immigration of these people to the
TTnitofi At.ntfa Ttianv other countries being
closed to them is largely increasing and
likely to assume proportions which may make
it difficult to find home and employ
ment for them here and to seriously affect the
l&hnr marUntL It is estimated that over one
million will be forced from Russia within a few
years. The Hebrew is never a beggar; he has
always kept the law often under severe and
AMMadnn nivi mstrictions. It is also true
that no race, seot or class has more fully oared
for its own than the Hebrew race. But the
sudden transfer of such a multitude, under con
ditions that tend to strip them of their small
accumulations and to deress their energies
and courage, is neither good for them nor lor us.
The banishment, whether by direct decree er
by not less certa n indirect methods, of so large
a number of men and women is not a local
question. A decree to leave one country is, .in
the nature of things, an order to enter anotner.
This consideration, as well as the suggestions

monstrances which we have presented to Rus

ernment can not fail to give the assurances
that our representations are those ot a sincere
well wisher.
THE NICARAGUA CANAL,
The annual report of the Maratime Canal
Company, of Nicaragua, shows that much cost
ly and neoessary preparatory work has been
done during the year in the construction of
shoos, railroad tracks, harbor piers and break
waters, and that the work of canal construc
tion has made some progress. I deem it to be
a matter of the highest ooncern to the United
States that this canal, connecting tne waters
of the Atlantic and Pacific ooeans, giving us a
Hhnrt water communication between our ports
upon those two great seas, should be speedily
constructed and at the smallest practicable
n mit. nf cost. The sain in frelirhts to tne peo
ple and the direct saving to the government of
the United States In the use of naval vessels
would pay the entire cost of this work within a
short series of years. The report of the secre
tary of the navy shows the saving in our naval
expenditures wnion wouia resuiu
if thti vnrii la to be promoted by the usual
financial methods and without the aid of this
government the expenditures will probably be
l twin the actual cost. This will neoessltate
cnastitute a heavy and need
less burden upon our commerce and that ot the
' world. Every dollar of the boads and stock of
' th.e cqnjpany should represent a dollar ex
pended in the legitimate and economical prose
cution of the work. This is only possible by
giving to the bonds the guaranty of tlfe United
states government, suoh a guaranty would
seoure the ready sale at par ot a 3 per cent,
bond, from time to time, as the money was
needed. I do not doubt that, built
upon these business methods the oanal
would, when fully inaugurated, earn
its fixed charges and operating expenses.
A guaranty of the bonds ot the canal company
to an amount necessary to the completion of
the canal could, I think, be so given as not
to involve any serious risk of ultimate loss. The
things to .be carefully guarded are the com
pletion of the work within the limits of the
guaranty ; the subjugation of the United States
to the rights of the first mortgage bondholders
for any amount it may have to pay, and in the
meantime a control of the stock of the company
as a security against mismanagement and
loss. I most sincerely hope that neither
party nor sectional lines will be drawn upon
this great American project, so full of in
terest to the people ot all our states and bo in-
nuentiai in its erfeots upon, the prestige . and
prosperity of our common country.
EFFECT OF TARIFF LEGISLATION. .
The general interest In the operations of the
treasury department has been much augmented
during the last year by reason of the conflicting
predictions, which accompanied and followed
the tariff and other legislation of the last con
gress affecting the revenues as to the results
of this legislation upon the treamry and upon
the country, on the one hand it was contended
that imports would so fall off as to leave the
treasury Dannrupt ana tnat tne prices of arti
cles entering into the living of the people would
be so enhanced as to disastrously affect their
comfort and happiness, while on the other it was
argued that the loss to the revenue, largely the
result of placing sugar on the free list, would be a
direct gain to the' people ; that the price of the
necessaries of life, inoluding those most highly
protected, would not be enhanced ; that labor
would have a larger market and the products of
the farm advanced prices; wbn the treasury
surplus and receipts would be adequate to
meet the appropriations, including the large
expenditures for the refunding to the states of
the direct tax and the redemption of the 4 ;4
per cent, bonds. It is not my purpose to enter
at any length into a discussion of the effects
of the legislation to which I have referred But a
brief examination of the statistics of the treas
ury and a general glance at the state of business
throughout the country will, I Think, satisfy
any impartial inquirer that its results have dis
appointed the evil prophecies of its opponents
and in a-large measure realized the hopeful pre
dictions of its friends. Rarely If ever before in
the history of the country hafthere been a
time when the proceeds of one day's labor or
the product ot one farmed aore would purchase
so large an amount of those things that enter
into the 1' ving of the masses of the people. I
believe that a full test will c?velop the fact
that the tariff act of the Fifty irst congiess is
very favorable in its average effect upon the
prices of articles entering into common use.
During the twelve months from October 1,
18W. to September 30, 1891, tli total value of
our foreign commerce (imports and exports
combined) was 81,747,806,409. which was the
largest of any year in the history of the United
States. The largest in any previous year was
in lsuu, wnen our commerce amounted to
647,139,093 and the last year exceeds this enor
mous aggregate by over one hifcidred millions.
During the year ending September 30. 1S91,
our imports of merchandise amounted to
t824,715,-i70, which was an increase of
more than eleven million dollar over the value
of the imports ot the corresponding months ot
the preceding year, when the imports ot mer
chandise were unusually large in anticipation
of the tariff legislation then pajaaing. rne av
erage annual value of the imports of merchan
dise for the ten years from 1881 to 1890 was Hm.-
186,522, and during the year ending September
30, 1891, this annual average was exceeded by
$1.12,538,469.
The value of free imports during the twelve
months ending September 30, 1891, was $118,
09&387 more than the value of free imports
during the corresponding twelve months of the
preceding year, and there was during the same
period a decrease of $106,846,508 in the value of
imports Ol uutiuoie mercnanuistr. xua iwiubq,
B2e of merchandise admitted free of duty dur
ing the year to which I have referred, the first
under the new tariff, was 48.18. while during
the preceding twelve months, under the
old tariff. the percentage was 31.27
an increase of 13.91 per cent. If we take the six
months ending September 30 last, which covers
the time during which sugars have been ad
mitted tree of duty, the per cent, of value ot
merchandise imported free of duty is found to
be a larger percentage than any prior fiscal
year in the history of the government. If we
turn to exports of merchandise the statistics
are full of gratification. The value of
such exports of merchandise for the twelve
months ending September 30, 1891, was
$923,091,135. while for the corresponding prev
ious twelve months it was $860,177,115, an in
crease of $62,914,031, which is nearly three times
the average annual Increase of exports of mer
chandise during any year in the history of the
government. Tne increase in tne vaiue oi ex
ports of agricultural products during the year
referred to over the corresponding twelve
months of the prior year was $45,846,197, while
the increase in tne value oi exports oi manu
factured products was $16,833,240.
There is certainly nothing in the condition ol
trade, foreign or domestic, mere is certainly
nothing in the condition of our people oi anj
class to suggest that the existing tariff and
revenne letrislation bears oppressively upon tne
people or retards the commercial development
of the nation. It may be argued that our condi
tion would be better it our tariff legislation
were upon a free trade basis, Dut it oau not oe
denied that all the conditions of prosperity and
of generul contentment are present in a larger
degree than ever before in our history, and that,
too, just when it as prophesied they would be
in the worst state. . .
I think ther are conclusive evidences tnat
the new tariff has created several great indus
tries which will, within a few years, give em
ployment to several hundred thousand Ameri
can workingmon and women. In view of the
somewhat overcrowded condition 01 me lauui
market ot the United States every patriolio
citizen should rejoice at such a result.
RECEIPTS AND DISBURSEMENTS.
The report of the secretary of the treasury
Shows that the total receipts of the govern
ment from all sources tor tue fiscal year ending
June 30, 1891, were $4;8,544,233, while the ex-
Jienditures for the same period were s-ui,aiM,u,
eaving a surplus of J7,s w,7o2.a. The receipts
of the tisoal year ending June SO, 189-i, actual
and estimated, are 4Ai,uoJ,uuo and tne tiiwuui
tures MOi,OjO,uO0. For the fiscal year ending
June SO, 181, the estimated receipts are 4aa,
336,350 and the expenditures $141,30.), 093.
THE SILVER COINAGE QUESTION.
Under the law of July 14, 1890, the secretary oi
the treasury has purchased since August is,
during the fiscal year, 48,39,113 ounces of silver
bullion at an average cost of tl.u45 per ounce.
In exchange for this silver bullion have been
issued, S3u,o77,4i oi tne treasury noies aumui
ized by the act. The price ot silver on Nov. 1
was only S0.98, which would give to the silver
dollar a bullion value of 74 K cents. -m
Before the influence of the protective silver
legislation was lelt in the market it never was
worm in .in ew noric aDove per uuuea. .
ablest advocates of free coinage in the last con
gress were confident in tneir prediotion that
tne purcnases py tne government requuou wj.
the law would at once Dring the price of sliver
to 1.20 per ounce, which would make the Duuion
value ol a dollar luu cents ana uom i mem.
The prophecies of the anti-silver men of
disasters to result from the coinage of
XOOJooo per month were not wider of the
mark. Friends of free silver are not agreed, I
think, as to the" cause that brought their hopeful
predictions to naugm. some lacts are jmuwi.
The exports of silver from London to India
during the first nine months of this calendar
year fell off over do per cent, or $17,202,730 com
pared with the same months of the preceding
year. The exports of domestic silver bullion
irom this country, which had averaged for the
last ten years over $17,000,000, fell in the last
fiscal year to $13,797,391; wnue, ior mo iu
time in recent years, the imports of silver into
this country exceeded the imports Dy $2,743,863.
In the previous year the net exports of silver
from the United States amounted to 8,545,455.
The production of the United States increased
from 50,00U,uw ounces in 1889 to 54,000,000
In 180. The government is now buy
ing and putting aside annually 54,000,000
ounces, wnich, allowing for 7,140,000
ounces of new bullion used in the arts, is
6,640,000 more than our domestic products avail
able for coinage. I hope the depression in the
price of silver is temporary and that a further
trial of this legislation will more lavorably
fiifnt it. That tha increased volume of cur
rency thus supplied for the use of the people
was needed and that beneficial results upon
trade and prices have followed this legislation
I think must be very clear to every one ; nor
should it be foraotten that for every dollar of
taese notes issued a full dollar's worth of silver
bullion ist at the time deposited in tue treasury
as securitv for its redemption. Upon this sub
ject, as upon the tariff, my recommendation is
tnat the existing laws De given a iuu inui uiu
that our business, interests be spared the dis
tressing iniluenoo which threats of radical
changes always impart.
1 am still ot the opinion that the free coinage
of silver under existing conditions would disas
trously affect our business interests at home
and abroad. We could not hope to maintain an
equality to the purchasing power of the gold
and silver dollar in our markets, and in foreign
trade the stamp gives no added value to the
bullion oontained iu coins. The producers of
the country, its farmers and laborers, have the
highest interest that every dollar, paper or
com, issned by the government shall be as good
as any other. If there is one less valuable
than another its sure and constant errani
will be to pay them for their toil,
and for their crops. The money lender will
protect himself by stipulating for payment in
gold, but the laborer has never been able to do
that. To place business upon a silver basis
would mean a sudden and severe contraction
of the currency, by the withdrawal of gold and
gold notes, and such an unsettling of all values
as would produce a commercial panic. I can
not believe that a people so strong and prosper
ous as ours will promote such a policy.
The producers of silver are entitled to
just consideration, but they should not forget
that the government is now buying and putting
out on the market what is the equivalent of the
entire products of our silver mines. This is
more than they themselves thought of asking
two years ago. I believe it is the earnest de
sire of a great majority of the people, as It is
mine, that a full coin use shall be made of sil
ver just as soon as the co operation of the
other nations can be secured and a ratio fixed
that will give circulation equally to gold and
Biiver. The business of the world requires the
use of both metals ; but I do not see any pros
pect of gain, but much of loss, by giving up the
present system, in which a full use is made of
gold aud a large use ot silver, for
one in which silver alone will cir
culate. Such an event would be at
once fatal to the further progress of the silver
movement. Bimetalism is the desired end, and
the true friends of silver will be careful not to
overrun the good and bring in silver monomet
allism, with its neoessary attendants, the loss
of our eold to liurope and the relief of the
pressure there for a larger currency. I endeav- .
ored to keep a close observation of the state of
public sentiment in Europe upon this question,
uvO UUI wfta4 V DV SUC&
to lustifv me in proposing -
an'international conference. There is, however,
I am sure, a growing sentiment in Europe in
favor of a larger use of silver, and I know of no
more effectual way of promoting this sentiment
than by accumulntlng gold here. A scarcity of
gold in the European reserves will oe tne most
persuasive argument for the use of silver.
THE TREASURT SURPLUS.
The presence ot a large cash surplus In the
treasury has for many years been the subject of .
much unfavorable criticism and has furnished
an argument to those who have desired to place
the tariff upon a purely revenue basis. It was
agreed by all that the withdrawal from circular
tion of so large an amount of money was an em-
barassment to the Business ol the country and
made necessary the intervention of the
department at frequent intervals to re
lieve threatened monetary panics. The
surplus on March 1, 1889, was $133,827.
190.9. She policy of applying this surplus to
the redemption of the interest-bearing securi
ties of tue v nitea states was tnougnt to De
preferable to that ot depositing it without in
terest in national banks. There have been re
deemed since the date last menltoned of interest-bearing
securities 8259,079,350, resulting in a
reduction oi tne annual interest cnarge oi wi,-
684,475. The money which tiad Wen deposited
in banks without interest has been gradually
withdrawn and used In theTedemption of bonds.
The result of this policy, oi tne silver legisla
tion, and of the refunding of the 4H per cent,
bonds has been a large increase of the money
in circulation. At the date last named the cir
culation was $1,404,805,693, or $23.03 per capita;
while on December 1, 1891, it had increased to
$1,577,232,075, or $24.38 per capita. The offer of
the secretary oi tne treasury to noiaers oi tne
4S per oent bonds to extend the time of redemp
tion, at the option of the government, at an in
terest of 2 per cent., was accepted by the
holders of about one half the amount, and the
unextended bonds are being redeemed on pre
sentation. THE WAR DEPARTMENT. '
The report of the secretary of war exhibit
the results of an Intelligent, progressive and
business-like administration of a department,
which has been too much regarded as one of
mere routine. Some especially good work has
been accomplished. The efforts of the secre
tary to reduce the percentage of desertions by
showing the causes that produoed it have been
so successful as to enable him to report for the
last year a lower percentage of desertions than
has been before reached in the history of the
army.
The work of securing sites for shore batteries
for harbor defense and the manufacture of mor
tars and guns of high power to equip them
have made good progress during the year.
The preliminary work of tests and plans which
so long delayed a start, is now out of the way.
Some guns have been completed, and with an
enlarged shop and a more complete equlpmentat
Watervliet the army will soon be abreast of the
navy in gun construction. Whatever unavoida
ble causes of delay may arise there shonld be
none from delayed or insufficieht appropria
tions. We shall be greatly embarrassed in the
proper distribution and use of naval vessels
until adequate shore de'enes are provided for
our harbors.
I conour in the recommendation of the secre
tary that the three-battallion organization be
adopted for the infantry: The adoption of a
smokeless powder and of a modern rifle equal
in range, preoision and rapidity of fire to the
best now in nse will, I hope, not be longer de
layed. The project of enlisting Indians and or
ganlzing them into seperate companies upon
the same basis as other soldiers was made the
subject of very careful study by the secretary
and received my approval. Several companies
have been completely organized and seven
more are in process of organization. The re
sults of six month's training have more than
realized the highest anticipations.
UNLAWFUL CHINESE IMMIGRATION.
The enforcement by the treasury department .
of the law prohibiting the coming of Chinese to.
the United States has been effective as to such
as seek to land from vessels entering our porta.
The result has been to divert the travel to ves
sels entering the port of British Columbia,
whence passage into the United States at ob
scure points along the Dominion boundary it
easy. A considerable number ot Chinese
laborers have, during the past year, en
tered the United States from Canada
and Mexico. The officers of the treas
ury department and of the department
of justioe have used every means at their com
mand to intercept this immigration; but thi
impossibility of perfectly guarding our extend
ed frontier is apparent. The dominion govern
ment collects a head tax of $50 from every Cht '
naman entering Canada and thus derives a con
siderable revenue from those who Only use its
ports to reach a position of advantage to evade
ourexolusion laws. There seems to be satis
factory evidence that the business of passing
Chinamen through Canada to the United States
is organized and quite active. The department
of justice has construed the laws to require th
return of any Chinamen found to be
unlawfully in this country to China as
the country from which he came, notwithstand
ing the fact that he came by way ot Canada;
but several of the district oourts have, in oacea
brought before them, overruled this view of the
law and decided that suoh persons must be re
turned to Canada. This construction robs the
law of all effectiveness, even il the decrees
could be executed, for the man returned ean
the next day recross our border. But the only
appropriation made is for sending them back
to China and the Canadian officials refuse to
allow them to re-enter Canada without the pay
ment of the $50 head tax. 1 recommend sucn
legislation as will remedy these defects in the
law.
In previous messages I have called the at
tention of congress to the necessity of so ex
tending the jurisdiction of the United States
oourts so as to make triable therein any felony
committed while in the act ot violating a law
of the Unitod States. These courts can not
have that independence and effectiveness which
the constitution contemplates so long as the
killing of high court officers, Jurors, and wit
nesses in the discharge of their duties, or by
reason of their acts as such, is only cognizabU
in the state courts. The work done by th
attorney general and the officers of his depart
ment, even under the present inadequate legis
latlon, has produoed some notable results in
the interest of law and order.
THE POSTAL SERVICE.
In the report of the postmaster general some
very gratifying results are exhibited and many
betterments of the service suggested. A pe
rusal of the report gives abundant evidence thai
the supervision and direction of the postal sys
tem have been characterized -by an Intelligent
and conscientious desire to improve the service.
The revenues of the department show an in
crease of over $5,000,000, while the estimate foi
the year 1S93 shows a surplus of receipts ovei
expenditures.
Eight thousand miles of new postal service
have been established on railroads ; the car dis
tribution to sub stations in the great oities
has been increased about 18 per cent, while the
percentage of errors in distribution has been
reduced over one-halt. An appropriation was
given by the last congress for the purpose oi
making some experiments in free delivery in
the smaller cities and towns. The results ol
these experiments have been so satisfactory
that the postmaster general recommends, and
I concur In the recommendation, that the free
delivery system he at once extended to town
of 5,000 population. His discussion of the in
adequate facilities extended under our present
system to rural communities and his sugges
tions with a view to give these communities a
fuller participation in the benefits of the post
al service are worthy of your careful consider
ation. Over 54,000 neighborhoods are, under the pres
ent system, receiving mail at post offloes where
money orders and postal notes are not issued.
The extension of this system to those commu
nities is especially desirable, as the patrons ot
such offioes are not possessed of the other facil
ities offered in more populous communities for
the transmission of small sums of money. 1
have, in a message to tho preceding congress,
expressed my views as to a modified use of the
telegraph In connection with the postal service.
THE NAVY.
The report ot the secretary of the navy shows
a gratifying inorease of new naval vessels in
commission. The Newark, Ctpcord. Benning
ton and Miantonomob, have been added during
the year, with an aggregate of something more
than 11,000 tons. Tweaty four war ships of all
olasses are now under construction in the navy
yards and private shops, but while the work
upon them is going forward satisfactorily, the
completion of the more important vessels will
vpt rfimiirA ahnut a viir1! time. Some ot the
I vessels now under construction, it is believed,
will De triumpns oi naval engineering.
We have now at Washington a gun shop, or
ganized and conducted by naval ofnpers, that
in its system, economy and product is unex
celled. Experiments with armor plate hava
been conducted during the year w ith most im
portant results. It is now believed that a plate
of higher resisting power than any in use has
been found and that the tests have demon
strated that cheaper methods of manufacture
than those heretofore thought necessary can
be used.
THE INDIANS.
The report of the secretary of the interioi
shows that a very gratifying progress has been
made in ail of the bureaus which make up that
department. The work in the bureau of Indian
affairs was perhaps never so large as now by
reason cf the numerous negotiations whioh
have been proceeding with the tribes
for a reduction ot the reservations with
the Incident labor ot making allotments,
and was never more carefully conducted.
The good work ot reducing the larger Indian
reservations by allotments In severalty to the
Indians, and the cession of the remaining lands
to the United States for disposition under the
homestead law, has been prosecuted during the
year with energy and suocess. In September
last, it was enabled to open to settlement in
Oklahoma 900,000 acres of laud, all of which
was taken up by settlers In a single day.
The negotiation for the release by the Chero
kees of their claim to the Cherokee Strip has
made no substantial progress, but it is still
hoped that the oession of this large and valu
able tract may be secured. The price which the
commission was authorised to offer-$l.86 per
acre is, in my judgment, a fair and adequate
one and should have been accepted by the In
dians. Since March 4, 188, about 83,000,000
acres have been separated from Indian reserva
tions and added to the public domain, for the
use of those who desired to secure free homes
under our beneiicent laws.
inn PENSION BUREAU.
The administration of the pension bureau has
been characterised during the year by great
diligence. Tin total number of pensioners
upon the roll oa the 33th day of June, 1891, was
6(6,160. There were allowed during the fiscal
year ending at t lat time 250,560 cases. Of this
number, 102.3 ..' were allowed under the law of
June 2?, 1SJ0. 'f he issuing of certificates has
been proceeds: at the rate ot about 30,000 per
month, about 7 per cent of these being eases
under the new 1 iw. The commissioner says
he will be able to carefully adjudicate and al
low 350 000 clai.ns during the present fiscal
year. The a r ipriation for the payment ot
pensions for tue tisoal year 1890-91 was $187,635.
798, and the amo.unt expended $113, 530.649, leav
