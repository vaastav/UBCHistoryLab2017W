A Gigantic Federation Among
Railroad Men.
Movement to;Combine 200,000
Employes in One Order.
DO WHAT DEBS FAILED
The Seed Sown at Peoria to
Bear Fruit.;
To Amalgamate Fire'.Organiza
tions in One.
New York, Deo. S. A movement is on
foot to combine more than 200,000 rail
road employes in the fnited States in
to one big- organization. The move
ment has for its purpose the amalgama
tion ot the five organizations of engi
neers, firemen, conductors, trainmen
and telegraphers into one confedera
tion. A conference committee of the va
rious organizations took place recent
ly at Peoria, 111., which marked out
plans for a permanent federation. This
plan has now been submitted lo a gen
eral voie of the members of all the
brotherhoods and orders of railroad
men. except the engineers, who, say
they will adopt it at their next con
vention. The railroad employes are trying to
do what Debs signally failed to do with
his American Railway union. The
Pullman strike taught the railroad em
ployes a great lesson. They found tht
in order to resist the pressure brought
to bear on them by great combinations
of Tailroad magnates it was necessary
to meet them on their ground with
great combinations of labor. Should
this confederation be effected it would
be capable of starting the greatest rail
road strike that ever took place.
WELLINGTON'S BOOM.
Has Bright Prospects in a Uailroad
Way Ahead.
The Panta Fe's re-establishment o?
the trainmaster's and train dispatcher's
offices at Wellington has led to the sup
position that the division su;erintend
ent's office, which was abolished anj
with the other places two years ago.
will be put in again. For the last two
years the business of the Panhandle
division has been directed from Wich
ita and Arkansas City.
There is a report that the Albu
querque extension from . Panhandle.
Tex., will be commenced the first of the
year. It is the c pinion of local railroa 1
officials that if the division superin
tendent is located at Wellington the
office will be in chaise of C. J. Hart
man, formerly of W ichita. but now
with the Mexican Central,' witri head
quarters at El Paso, Tex., or revision
Superintendent F. T. Dolan of Wichita,
who may be moved to Wellington.

BLOCK SYSTSM EXTENSION.
Santa Fa Will a: Ones Equip Thoir
Chicago Division.
One of the most important improve
ments now contemplated by the man
agement of the Santa Fe railway for
the year 19S, and one which will un
doubtedly be carried out. is the exten
sion of the absolute block signal sys
tem, now in operation over the Em
poria branch and main line from Kan
sas City to Newton, over the Chicago
division. Engineer of Signals J. K.
Hobson is now preparing plans in this
city for the extension, and it is prob
able that this will be included in the
list of improvements authorized by
President Ripley soon after the first of
the year.
The Chicago division extends from
There are cough medicines that

Chicago to Kansas City, and includes
4Ti3 miles of track. The traffic o'n this
division is probably heavier the year
around than on any other division of
the road, and for this reason an effort
will be made to equip it with the ab
solute block system before any of the
western divisions. The system was
first placed on the Emporia branch as
an experiment, and worked so satis
factorily that the management at once
secured the services of Mr. J. S. Hob
son, as engineer of signals and ordered
the system placed on the main line
from Kansas City to Newton. It is
now but a question of time until the en
tire track of the Santa Fe railway prop
erwill be similarly equippad.
SUCCESSFUL 21 AIL CRANK.
Burlington Road Experiments With a
Mail Sack Catcfcr.ng Device.
Chicago, Dec. S. The Burlington rail
road yesterday made a test of a new
device by which mail sacks are deliver
ed as well as caught by fast moving
trains. A special train ran to Craw
ford, where a crane of the new pattern
had been erected. In making the de
liveries and catches two large rings, 15
inches in diameter, are used. The sack
or sacks are held together by a strap
having a halter hook. When the sacks
are rea'dy to be delivered or caught the
snap hook on the strap is hooked on
the rirg. One ring is hung on the car
catcher and the other is suspended
from the arm of the crane. The train
moves past the crane delivering a sack
to the crane, a hook being adjusted for
the purpose, and takes one from the
crane at precisely the same instant. The
sack left by the train swings about on
the crane arm and is lowered to the
ground, where it remains until some
one detaches it. The sack caught by
the train is swung into the car instant
ly. The party was accompanied by Mr.
Fleming, the Inventor of the contriv
ance, and under his direction six runs
were made past the crane. From one
to three sacks were delivered and
caught at one time, and while the tests
were being made the train ran as fast
as Tj7 miles an hour.
The machine 1s said to be a success
and if it is it means the solution of a
grave difficulty encountered for years.
The I Turlington will likely equip its
main line with the new device, and the
inventor claims that the Pennsylvania
company will do likewise. .
RATES ON MELONS.
Santa Fe Announces-Its Rates on the
Rocky Ford Crop.
Denver, Col., Dec. 8. Watermelon
and cantaloupe business will be a hus
tling industry at Reeky Ford next sum
mer. This is because the Santa Fe
road proposes-, to ship great quanti
ties in refrigerator cars to Chicago and
other eastern points. As a stimulus to
the raising of melons -for eastern mar
kets. General Freight Agent C. H.
Morehause, of the Santa Fe office in
this city yesterday announced the fol
lowing rates on melons, which will
cover next summer's shipments:
Ivocky Ford to Missouri river points,
ST. cents per 100 pounds; Rocky Ford "to
Mississippi river points, 41 cents per
100 pounds Rocky Ford to Chicago, 46
cents per 100 pounds.
Last year Rocky Ford growers ship
ped by the Santa Fe road to Eastern
markets, -550" carloads of melons.
The shipping season begins early in
Aurust and continues two months. The
local committee of Rocky Ford melon
growers. Senator Swink, chairman, ex
pects to ship east this year a thousand
carloads. Each car contains 400 crates
of melons. 60 pounds to the crate.
These melons are transported in re
frigerator cars. In each end of a re
frigerator car there is an ice tank with
a capacity of two tons of ice. By these
means the temperature of the car is
maintained at a constant temperature
of 35 degrees above zero.
THOUGHT IT WAS WHISKY.
Blistako of Brakernen Erindley and
Shepherd May Prove a Double
Fatality.
The condition of Jim Shepherd, who
was poisoned a few days tgo at Flor
ence, is far from good. Shepherd suf
fers greatly and it has been a question
with the physicians whether he could
pull through or not.
n last Saturday Shepherd and Bart
Brindley, both middle division men, had
some soda pop they wished to drinl:
and they mixed it with what they sup
posed to be whisky, at a Florence lunch
counter. In a short time after they
had drank it they were taken suddenly
sick. An examination was made and
it was discovered that the stuff they
had mixed with the pop was not whis
ky but rheumatism medicine. Brindie.,'
died on Sunday at Emporia, and there
can be but little hope for Shepherd.
FOR DEEPER WATER.
Port Arthur Channel Company to
Build a Ship Canal.
Fort Arthur, Dec. 8. The Port Ar
thur Channel and Dock company, the
company that is building the ship canal
at Port Arthur that will give the Kan
sas City, Pittsburg and Gulf railroad
its deep water connection, is an inde
pendent corporation distinct from the
railroad company. Its terminal facil
ities will be open to all applicants.
A mortgage has been authorized for
$2,500,000. under which thirty year 5 per
cent bonds will be issued to the amount
of Sl.500.000.The proceeds from the sale
of these bonds will be used to pay for the
canal, already partly finished, for ware
houses, piers, etc., as also for 3.500 acres
of land at Port Arthur and along tha
line of the canal. The company owns
two and a half mile3 of water front at
Port Arthur, and has the franchise for
the street car service in Port Arthur.
The interest on the bonds will be se
cured from the sales of lands and build
ing sites and from warehouse and ter
minal charges.
NEW ELECTRIC RAILROAD.
Line From Colorado Springs to Crip
ple Creak Certain.
Colorado Springs, Col., Dec. 8. A car
load of copper wire is now en route to
this city and will be used in the con
struction of the new electric railroad
between this point and Cripple Creek.
It was stated today on good authority
that grading operations would be com
menced on January 1 next.
Yesterday the' Cripple Creek District
Electric railroad filed a mortgage with
the county clerk for the use of the Cen
tral Trust company, of New York, for
51.250.000. "This mortgage is to secure
the payment of bonds to be issued by
the company for the building of the
road.
SANTA IE'3 HISTORY.
Treasurer Wilder to Begin the Work
About the Pir3: of the New Year.
Early in 1S98 Treasurer Edward
Wilder, of the Santa Fe. will commence
the official history of the Santa Fe
railway. This was authorized by Pres
ident Ripley some time ago, but as the
work in the treasurer's office is heaviest
near the end of each year, Mr. Wilder
has been unable to devote any time to
the history. After the first of the year
the work slackens, and Mr. Wilder will
then take up the work of writing the
history.
The official history will tell of the ad
vancement of the pioneer western rail
road from its incorporation up to and
Including the Santa Fe silver anniver
sary celebration of last fall.
RAILROAD SCHOOL.
Plan of tho L. & N. to Educate Track
Foremen.
Mascoutah, 111., Dec. 8. The Louis
ville & Nashville railroad yesterday in
troduced a new plan on that system by
which it is expected to materially ad
vance the education In railroad work
of the track foremen.
A special inspection train with a per
fectly equipped inspection car is to be
run annually or semi-annually for the
benefit of the section "bosses."
Expert railroad engineers and offi
cials accompany the trackmen, and,
while they are getting practical knowl
edge about the railroad on which they
are employed, they also receive free
lectures on the fine points in modern
railroad building. There were about
100 section foremen on the special car
which left East St. Louis yesterday
for a trip over the St. Louis and Hen
derson division. The party was in
charge of Supervisor Julius C. Dew of
the St. Louis division.

on. Everything to facilitate the work
in this department has been done. Yes
terday the new machine shop in con
nection with the car building depart
ment was in running order for the first
time. Heretofore the work that will
be done by this department has been
done in the mechanical department but
by having a wheel press, wheel lathe,
drills etc., at hand it will be a savins
of time and trouble. Like all other
departments the machines are operated
by compressed air.

ARMOUR IS
OUTWITTED.
Ilis Plans to Concentrate "Wheat
in Chicago
Are Defeated by the Bull Clique
Headed by Leiter.
IT WILL GO ON EAST.
Arrangements Made for For
warding December Wheat
By All Kail Routes to the At-
lantic Seaboard.
TONXAGE FOR EUROPE
Has Already Keen Engaged in a
Feeling of Certainty
That Wheat Will Continue to
Advance iu Price.
Minneapolis, Dec. 8. The Journal
prints today what it claims to be the
inside of the Armour wheat deal and
explanation of the clash between that
astute operator and the Chicago bull
clique. It has developed that L. Z.
Leiter is one of the principals in the
bull clique and that George B. French
is the active manager if its interests.
The clique views with composure the
Armour plan of buying wheat in the
Minneapolis market and shipping it to
Chicago and delivering it under con
tract so late in December that the
freezing of the river will prevent its
shipment east. It is supposed Armour
expected thus to secure the storage of
a large share of the wheat for his Chi
cago elevators until spring.
It will come as a genuine surprise to
the trade to learn that the bull clique
far from permitting the wheat to re
main in storage all winter, will ship it
all-rail east, where it has already en
gaged Boston and New York tonnage
for Europe. In this way the December
wheat will be eliminated from the situ
ation. The Journal asserts that the
bull clique is engineering no artificial
corner and will try to squeeze no one.
The clique believes that a legitimate
advance is inevitable in May and is act
ins on that theory.
A HURRIED WEDDING.
But Jack Newman and His Bride are
Happy and Don't Care.
Topeka young people experienced an
other great surprise today in the wed
ding of Jack Newman to Miss Louise
Clemens of Parsons.
The ceremony wes performed at fif
teen minutes past -leven o'clock, in the
presence of Miss Rachel Baldwin and
Leslie Guild, by Rev. A. S. Embree,
pastor of the First Methodist church at
his home, t34 Taylor street.
The contracting parties first met In
this city five weeks ago when Miss
Clemens came to Topeka to visit Miss
Rachel Baldwin, who is a sister of the
late Mrs. H. W. Neiswanger.
Mr. and Mrs. Newman will live In
Potwin at the home of Mr. Newman's
mother, on Woodlawn avenue.
It has been understood among imme
diate friends of the young people that
the marriage would take place next
week, bpt the fact that the groom has
been carrying a marriage license around
in his pocket for several days caused
the suspicion that perhaps it would
take place sooner.
After- securing the license Monday
Mr. Newman wrote to Miss Clemens'
father asking his consent to the union.
Miss Clemens wrote to her mother
making the same request and the two i
letters, containing also a request for as
answer, "yes" or "no" by telegraph,
were equipped with a special delivery
stamp and posted.
The letters should have reached Par
sons early yesterday morning and the
young couple waited yesterday and last
night in agitated suspense for the re
ply. Their anxiety was not relieved
even this morning, and the arrange
ments for the wedding were soon com
pleted. The contracting parties met down
town this morning and went immedi
ately to the home of Dr. Embree, where
the ceremony was performed.
When they left Dr. Embree's home
the attendants began showering them
with rice. This was continued, one can
follow the trail of the ride downtown,
up and down Kansas avenue for some
time. The spectacle in which Mr. and
Mrs. Newman were the principal fig
ures in the shower of rice on Kansas
avenue was the lirst intimation their
friends received concerning the mar
riage. Some doubted it even then and
looked upon the rice shower as a prac
tical joke. But it wasn't. The con
ditions justified it. The ceremony had
been performed and the young man and
his bride appeared on the street imme-
diately.
Mr. Newman is employed in the in
surance business by 51. W. Van Vai
kenburg. He is well-known in Tope
ka. having lived here many years. The
bride, although a stranger here, is a
handsome young woman and has min
gled with society people during her visit
here.
Being asked today what she would do
if her parents objected, the bride said:
"Oh my, I don't know. But it's too
late now."
The young couple seems sublimely
happy and their friends assert that it
was a ease of desperate love at "first
sight."
NEW QUARANTINE LINE.
There Has Been No Change Slado in
Kansas.
The t'nited States quarantine line for
next year will be the same as in the
past from the Pacific coast to the south
east corner of Kansas. At that point
It goes north to include three counties
in southeastern Missouri, then passes
east, placing Arkansas in the prohibited
area, also a part of Tennessee.
The open season will be from Novem
ber 15 to January 15. during which time
the quarantine regulations are not ef
fective. These regulations were agreed upon
and recommended to the secretary of
agriculture by the national convention
of live stock sanitary commissions at
St. Louis last week.
The national association honored
Kansas by electing Taylor Riddle sec
retary, Mr. Riddle is chairman of the
Populist state central committee and
secretary of the ICansas live stock san
itary commission. C. P. Johnson of
Springfield, III., was elected president
of the national association.
WAITING FOR GAGE
CContinued from First Page.
in which the members on the floor
heartily joined. This was a govern
ment for the people and by the people,
he declared, and no man should be
excluded from participation in the ex
ecutive branch of the government, by
accident or birth or the misfortunes of
early education, who was otherwise
qualified. Ohio, he said, had repudiat
ed the civil service law and was op
posed to building up an office holding
class in this country.
Mr. Brossius (Rep., Pa.), the chair
man of the committee on civil service,
defended the lav.- and the president's
interpretation of it. He thought any at
tempt to legislate upon the question
must be regarded as an indignity to the
executive.
Mr. Bailey (Dem Tex.), commended
Mr. Grosvenor's utterances against
building up an office holding class in
this country a doctrine, he said, which
was almost literally embodied in the
Chicago platform. (Democratic ap
plause.) "That is the only good fea
ture of that platform," ejaculated Mr.
Steele (Rep., Ind.), amid laughter on the
Republican side.
Mr. Johnson (Rep., Ind.), after some
opening remarks about the stupendous
folly of appointing a bimetallic com
mission to roll over Europe, made a
strong speech in defense of the civil
service law.
General Grosvenor, he charged with
being derilict to his duty as a Republi
can. That party, he said, was unalter
ably pledged to the support of the law.
Benjamin Harrison and William Mc
Kinley, the most distinguished expon
ents of its policies had fought for the
law in no uncertain language, and
General Grosvenor, he thought, well
merited the rebuke administered to h m
by Mr. Bailey when the latter charged
him with supporting the Chicago plat
form. (Laughter.) He 'marveled that
the mouthpiece of the administration
had fallen so low. No portion of the
president's message met with more
hearty endorsement than that relating
to the civil service and he warned his
colleagues that if they put through a
bill in antagonism to the law it would
be vetoed.
Moreover, he said, it was a mistake
to imagine that the sentiment of the
country opposed it. The law. was
heartily approved by all except a few
"degenerate politicians," who opposed
it from selfish motives. The trouble
was not with th,e law, but with its ad
ministration by spoilsmen.
Mr. Cochran (Dem., Mo.), in a satiri
cal speech, spoke of the injustice of
turning over a subject which Mr. Walk
er had freely admitted he knew all
about it to Mr. Dingley, who had fath
ered a tariff bill that had already pro
duced a $40,000,000 deficit.
Mr. Bland (Dem., Mo.), averred that
it was weil understood that nothing
would be done with the currency prob
lem, and Mr. Bodine (Dem., Mo.), al
leged that the civil service law was a
humbug which the West and South op
posed. The latter gave some amusing
illustrations of its operations and caus
ed a laugh by the statement that Mr.
Cleveland had been some time in the
White House before he discovered that
the United States was not bounded on
the west by the Alleghany mountains.
CONGF.E3S IS POLLED
Regarding the Principal Questions
to Come Before It.
New York, Dec. 8. A special to the
Journal from Washington, says: A re
porter has made a poll of congress upon
the most vital question likely to come
before that body at this session.
The following proposition was sub
mitted to the members of the house:
"Do you favor retirement of the
greenbacks?"
The surprise in the vote upon this
proposition was in the fact that such
Republicans as Belknap, Dolliver.Odell,
Henderson, Mesick, Bruce and Hopkins
were found in opposition. Not a single
Populist, of course, favored the propo
sition, while Brenner of Ohio and
Kitchen were the only Democrats in its
favor. The following propositions were
submitted to the senate:
"Can any radical financial legislation,
involving the retirement of the green
backs, the limitation of the legal tender
Quality of silver, or the issuing of gold
bones for the retirement of greenbacks,
pass the senate?"
There was practically a unanimous
sentiment that nothing can be done. On
this poll there was not an affirmative
vote.
The negatives were largely in the ma
jority and the doubt expressed by cer
tain senators virtually meant a nega
tive. ,
To the senate upon the matter of an
nexation this proposition was submit
ted: "Do you favor the annexation of Ha
waii?" Not a single straight Republican was.
found in opposition but Cannon and
Pettigrew, the silver senators voted in
favor of it. All the leaders of the Dem
ocratic party were opposed with the ex
ceptions of Morgan, Pettus, Rawlina
and Turpie.
I'pon the Cuban question these two
propositions were submitted to mem
bers cf the house of representatives:
"Do you favor the joint resolution
passed by the senate at the extra ses
sion declaring that a state of war ex
ists in Cuba?"
"Do you favor a resolution acknowl
edging the independence of Cuba?"
The first proposition seemed to meet
with the views of the greater portion of
the known friends of the insurgents, al
though the . Republicans were far be
hind the Democrats in numbers. Among
those on the Republican roll who voted
for the proposition were Belknap, Bou
telle. Danford, Davenport, Dorr, Grow,
Henry of Indiana, Robbins, Stevens and
Overstreet. All the Democratic leaders
favored it, such men as Bailey, Benton,
Bland, Ermentrout and Taylor of Ala
bama, being found among the positive
friends of belligerency.
Friends of Cuba appeared to be a bit
shy of the bold suggestion of Cuban
independence, probably for the reason
that the first proposition, having passed
the senate, affords the means of more
direct action, and throug i the fear that
congressional recognition of Cuban in
dependence might lead to complications
with Spain which the other move would
avoid.
HAWAII WILL WAIT.'
Annexation Treaty Will Not be Tak

Washington, Dec. 8. Senator Davis,
chairman of the foreign relations com
mittee says he is not ready to prcceed

A TACK IN 11 Ell El'E.
Irc. Herman Oslricha Victim of a
Painful Accident
New York. Dec. 8. Mrs. Herman Oel
ricfrs is .suffering from the results of a
strange accident to one of her eyes
which may result in the loss of sight.
Some workmen were engaged in hang
ing taijesiries in the east part of her
residence at the northeast corner of
Fifty-seventh street and Fifth avenue,
last Saturday afternoon, and Mrs. Oel
richs was superintending the details.
One of them was on top of a ladder
when a tack slipped from his hands
and fell.
Mrs. Oelrichs was standing close by,
with her face turned upward and the
sharp point of the tack struck her in
the eye, lacerating the corner and caus
ing intense pain. Mrs. Oelrichs bathed
the eye and, confident that the injury
was of a trival nature, was persuaded
to attend the silver wedding of the De
forests that evening. Her eye grew
worse and she had to leave before the
reception was over. Dr. Knapp. an eye
specialist, was immediately summoned,
and the family physician was also call
ed in. It was found that she had
caught cold in the eye, and she has
been confined to her room ever since.
On Monday the eye grew rapidly
worse, and a consulting physician was
caliad in.
The opinion was expressed by the
doctors that the point of the tack must
have been rusty, for the wound had be
come ulcerated and today the wound is
no better. Mrs. Oelrichs is the daugh
ter of the late Senator James G. Fair
of California and one of the heirs to the
millions left by him.
