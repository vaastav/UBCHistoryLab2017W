The HeMaa« sud Report.
The Qazbttb to-day lays bftore
the people of this Peninsula condensa
tions of the last message of President
Arthur and of the report of Secretary
MeCullooh, covering all the most import
ant points of both documents. Eaohtf
these deliverances is oharaoterised by a
liberality and progressiveness both
and weioome and whioh evidently drew
their inspiration from the recent
popular verdict rendered at the polls.
Upon the snbjeot of most vital importanoe,
the recognition of the fact that the
try is taxed too muoh and the time has
come when this harden ma-t be lightened
and the bars whioh Bhut
markets of the world mnat be taken
down, Secretary MoCnllooh honestly
plants himself abreast of the popular car
rent to the oonfessed dismay of the fast
diminishing band of high priests ot a
prohibitory tariff. Taken in all we ar e
pleased to say that we regard both duon
ments as the most meaty whioh have
emanated from the present administra
tion. There is muoh food for thought
and benefioent legislation in the
recommendations of the President
and the utterances of the
retary ol the Treasury.
Is one small matter
that is that the President should have
seen fit to reoommend a pens

farther enriching one who has already
been the reoipient of so many good things
from hla countrymen and who has been,
by private liberality, plaoed in the
possession of a sore income ample lor the
wants of any reasonable man ?
Dipping into
»anges we find
the New York Herald characterizing the
message as "
nnnsnally clear and
an ooinot summary of topfos of national
Interest, and its recommendations aud
ref erenoes entitle it to special considera
tion at the hands of CougresB." The
Herald is rather non oommittal In regard
to the secretary's report, ' and seems to
think that it does not go far enongh in itB
reoommendat<ons.
The World approves the President's
message, ana of^the secretary's report it
aaya: "It ia a little singular that the
first publio vindication of the Democratic
policy
eleoted by the people should
the Republican Swetary of the Treasury»
just as the Republican part ia about to
give up the lease of power it has held so
long."
To the editorial mind of the New
whioh Grover Cleveland was
from
York Timet, the message is but little
more than a summary of our affairs of
government, bat it finds that the views
of the secretary "npon the tariff
undoubtedly sound. He touches the
real difficulty with
manufacturing
interests when he aaks that they shall
bs helped to reaoh foreign markets, and
the real remedy, in great part at least, iu
the reduotion of the oostof
materials.
Whatever may be the aotion ol tbe
present or of the next Congress, nothing
la more oertain than that the tariff will
have to be reformed and in this
direction."
The New York Star ignores McCul
lough's report and lisa this to say,
editorially, ot the message : "So fa.- as
Congress is oonoerned, the President's
message is generally an empty formality.
But this message is unwontediy instruo
tive to the oonntry at large. No thought
ful person oan read it without realizing
that new men and a new party are wanted
to administer this government.''
Of the Philadelphia papers the alal
wart Inquirer and North American give but
editorial synopsis ot tbe pecretary'a
report, without comment, and mildly
dorse the message. The /V
the message
approves
"a plain, direct, dignified
paper, without striking propositions, but
full of good sense," aud says of the
report "While we dissent altogether from
some of the views put forth by the Se
tary of the Treasury, his repo, i, a
whole, is a moat able aud Interesting
The Record gives Mr. Arthur a good
word over the message, aud endorses
Seoretary MoCullough'a report in tbe fol
lowing manner: "What is especially
noteworthy about this report is that thb
recommendation« of the seoretary of tho
outgoing Republican administration iu
regard to tbe tariff are in perfdot harmony
wi th the platform on which the inooming
Demooratio President was eleoted. The
platform on whioh Cleveland
nated declared emphatically for repeal of
the duties

his greatest eastern elougatiou, 20 degrees
aud 12 minutes, on the 17th at 7 o'olock in
the evening. About that time he may be
pioked up by those who have sharp eyes, if
the weather be good, but his great southern
declination militates against his visibility.
He should be looked for about a degroe
south of the sunset point. Mercury will be
nearest the Hun on the morning of the 30th.
His course during the mouth will be from
Scorpio, across the Milky Way into Sagit
tarius.
One notable thing about Mercury's Decem
ber traok is that it twice crosses that of the
planet Mars, our nearest neighbor to tho
outward side from the Sun. The first of
these passages occurs at lip. m. of tho 4th,
when Mercury will be about 1>$ degrees
south of Mars. On the second occasion, at
midnight of the 20th, Mars will be nearly 2)£
degrees south of Mercury. Neither of these
ooujunctions will be visible.
Venus, although she passed her point of
greatest brilliancy as far back as August 17th,
is still a charming ornament of tho early
morning, as every one whoso duty calls him
from his bed before the Suu must have
noticed for himself. Even iu her diminished
lustre she still reigns indisputable queen of
the dawn, and can probably yet be
by the naked eye even after the Sun has
risen, (she certainly oould a week ago), long
after the greater Jupiter, companion of her
morning flight, has subsided from view. The
course of Veuuu during the month is from
Virgo, across Libra, into Scorpio. Her
diameter decreases from 14.2 seconds on the

message opens by referring to the reoent
Presidential election and says it is matter
of oongratnlation that, notwithstanding
the intense fervor of the campaign the
public peace has suffered no disturbance,
thus signally demonstrating the strength
and wisdom of

The President then refers to the electoral
dispute eight years ago, and says it is of

INDIANS
PUBLIC LANDS.
Referring again to absolute peaoe in
the Iodian country during the past year,
th« President finds justification lei the
policy of the government in dealing with
tLa I adieus. He also advises the repeal
r.f th« pre-emption law, the euaHmsut of
statutes respecting the present legal
plications tonohing lapsed grants to rail
road companies and the funding of the
debt of the several Paoiflo railroads under
snob guaranty as shall effsotnally secure

THE MORMON «•UBlTIOH.
r Referring to polygamy, the President
again reoommends that Congress assume
sbgoiu'e control of Utah Territory and
proceed with most radical measures con
sistent with the o.institut ion.
The President then refers at length to
the policy of extending our foreign trade.
He says the problem is oomplex and oan
be solved by no single measure
of innovation or reform. The
message then prooeeds to say :
"The countries of the Amerlosn conti
nent and adjaoent islands are for the
United States, the natural marts of sup
ply and demand. It is from these that
we should obtain wbst we do not pro
dnoe
oiency,
that the surplus promotions of our
fields, < ur mills and our work shops
should flow, under nontluuance that will
€qu%lfz> or favor them in comparison
with foreign oompe»i"ou. Four paths A
poiioy u«em to polat t> this end:
First,

of our own products. Tüe benefits of

removal ou both sides, from the vessel so
privileged of all tonnage dues ard
national Imports, so that these vessels
may ply nnhiodered between onr ports
aud those of the other con
tracting parties, though withant in
fringing
coasting trade. The removal
tion of burdens
of those oountries ooming within th*
benefits ol the treaties and avoidanoe of
teohrioal restrictions and penalties by
whioh
countries ie at present hampered.
Secondly, establishment of oonsnlar
servioe ol the United States on a salaried
footing thns permitting the relinquish
meut of ooDeular fees not only as respect?
vessels under the national ilag but also
as repeots vessel? of treaty nations carry
ing poods entitled to the benefits of the
treaties.
Thirdly, the enactment of measures to
favor the construction and maintenance
of a ste&u carrying marine ander the flag
of the United StateB.
Fourthly, the establishment of a uni
form currency basis for the countries of
America, so that the ooined products of
our mines may circulate
eqnal tarma throughout the who!«
system of commonwealths. This would
require a monetary union of Amerioa
whereby the out put of the bullion-pro
duoiug oountries and the oironlation of
those whioh yield neither gold
silver oould be adjusted in oonformity
with the popnlation, wealth and coçuner
oial needs of eaoh. As many of the
tries furnish no bullion to the common
stock, the surplus production of our own
mines and mints might thus be
utilised and a step taken towards
the general remonetization of silver. To
the accomplishment of these ends so far
as they

oouoluded and now iu progress
have been directed aud the favor whioh

warrants the belief that its operation will

no means desirable, however, that the

IMPEACHING MARSHAL WRIGHT.
A Washington special to the Philadel

Those who started out with the presump
tion that this seesion would be a strlotly
business sessiou and devoid of political
exoittment were rather disappointed to

marshals. he arguments consisted
mainly of crimination and reot mi

oonllned to members of the Ohio delegs

Pillett of Cincinnati, and J. Warren
Kelter, respectively. Mr. Follett ia smart

Butterworib, assisted by Marshal Lot
Wright and his thousand armed plug

demand satisfaction He rose to a ques

resolutions, with an impeaohment pre
amble. The preamble was in these worde:
