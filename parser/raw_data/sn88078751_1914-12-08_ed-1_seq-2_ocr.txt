BATTLE 8F LODZ
STILL RAGING
Berlin Says German Offensive Is
Taking its Normal Course.
RUSSIANS CLAIMING VICTORY
Early Fall of Cracow, Now Invested
by the Czar's Legions, Not Antici
pated by British Military Experts.
"Battle In Western Zone Reported to
Be at a Standstill Australian and
New Zealand Troops Arrive.
London, Dec. 5. According to un
official dispatches from tho Russian
capital, the battle of Lodz has ended
In success for the Russians, but this
statement Is opposed to that of tho
Berlin official report, which says tho
German offensive In Poland is talcing
Its normal course.
Tho fact Is that the fighting In this
region has developed Into such n Jum
ble that It Is almost Impossible to fol
low It. Tho most Important factor,
from tho allies' point of view, Is that
tho German advanco on Warsaw
seemingly has not succeeded In Its
object, nor has It had the effect of di
verting the Russians from their for
ward movement through tho Carpa
thians and on to tho plains of Hun
gary or against tho fortress of Cra
cow, around which they aro drawing
a closor ring of men and artillery.
Taking Into consideration tho rase
of Przemysl, which has held out so
long against -the Russian attacks, mil
itary men do not look for tho early
(all of Cracow and are rather Inclined
to bcllevo that the armies of Emperor
Nicholas will endeavor to keep tho
large Austrian forces inside the for
tress and enter Silesia from tho south
east. Much. depends, however, on tho bat
tle which is bolng fought with such
Intensity farther north between tho
rivers Vistula and Vrtho, and In
which all agreo tho 1 uses on both
tides have beon very heavy.
Tho battle In tho west appears to
be at a standstill. Tho allies and tho
Germans have attempted to take tho
offensive at different points along the
front, but as neither claims to hav3
made anyndwtnee and as both official
reports montlon repuIscR of tho en
emy, It Is evident that the attack
which have boon made have not mot
with much success.
Tho nrrlval of Australian and Now
Zealand contingents In I'gypt on forty
transports is quoted as another tri
umph for tho Hrltlsh navy. Tho Gor
man cruiser Hmdon was not far from
this flcot of transports when she was
overtaken and destroyed by tho Au
stralian cruiser Sydney.

ST. NICHOLAS
Day Is Observed In Holland
On Sunday
Amsterdnm, Dec. 5 No festival In
Holland exercises a more enchanting
spell over both old and young than tho
Dutchman's "Feast of St. Nicholas."
Tho Jolly old patron saint of children
corresponds in Holland to our Father
Chrlstmns though coming threo weeks
tarter, on the blithday of tho old
Spanish bishop, which falls on Dec. 0.
Tho feast of St. Nicholas has Its
puthetlc side this year, for, while tho
children aro to gather this evening to
elng tho old songs and welcome tho
coming of Santa, their elders are pray
ing that tho efforts of tho good Queen
Wllhelmlna to Induce the warring na
tions to accept peace may result in
tho restoration of happiness through
out stricken Europe. Tho queen has
sont a message by tho American min
ister to President Wilson at Washing
ton, and tho good people of Holland
are hoping Hint something can bo
done.
Tho original custom was for the
children to place their llttlo wooden
hoes upon tho hearth on the eve of
St. Nicholas Day, tho legend being
that on that night the holy man rode
over tho housotops on a snow-white
steod accompanied by his llttlo black
servant, a Moorish negro.
"Slnta Klaus" waB supposed to cai
ry with him a largo bag, full of toys
and sweets of nil kinds for the good
children, and riding over tho roofs he
throw tho presents In passing down
tho chimneys into tho shoes below.
After him camo tho llttlo black boy
carrying a birch rod as a souvenir for
tho very naughty ones.
In tho early days, the evo of St.
Nicholas was given over to tho chil
dren entirely, but by degrees tho
grown-ups have come more and moro
to share In It, until now In Holland it
Is a great gathering for big and little
onus alike. People sond presents ono
to nnothr, and a good deal of teasing
people about their pot weaknesses is
Indulged In.
St. Nicholas Day Is for all Dutch
children a day of tremendous excite
ment, of dlternato hopes and fears
(the latter for tho naughty boys with
n wholesome dread of the rod), and
nil that day they can tnlk of nothing
elso but "Slnta Klaas." As a rulo din
tioi Is taken an hour earlier than us
ual, and after tho meal Is eaten a
cosy led cover Is spread ovor the ta
ble, according to tho old Dutch cus
tom, and all sit around the table, tho
biggest children being supplied with
scissors to cut tho strings for tho
pnrc'els.
The father then says: "Childieu,
I think St. Nicholas may bo hero at
nny moment; lot us Blng him a llttlo
song that he may hoar you aro all
good eh Ul reu and aro oxpoctlng him."
Whoioupon, all lights aro tinned down
and In tho fever of expectation tho llt
tlo ones chant some quaint old song,
Whllo thoso songs nro being sung, ono
hears a ling at the door boll and a
nhullllng of feet on the thieshold out
Hide iinuouiiccR that ut last tho groat
moment hns arrived and old Fathor
Nicholas mid his llttlo back boy aro
bore. Stops aro heard along the pas
Kiigo, and thou In walks tho good old
paint himself, u vonerablo, white
bearded mnu, clad In a long flowing
lobo of rod or purple and loaning
heavily upon his golden staff. His
mantlo Is trimmed with golden em
broideries, and ho wonrs n goldon
mitre. Sllonco falls upon every ono;
men the children aro too overwhelm
ed by the solemnity of the moment to
chatter.
Ah lie oiitors, ho holds out u bund,
first to mother and then to fathor and
clasps them both; then ho asks them
If nil tho children have been good
throughout tho year, and calls each
child by nnmo to come and sluilto
Lands with him. And It Is Indeed n
marvellous thing how St. Nicholas
scorns to know all of their llttlo faultH
and fallings, and very ofton It has a
crv pood effect on tho children whou
he tolls thorn how It grieves him when
they aro naughty. The black boy con
coals his birch rod and upoiiH tho bag,
and tho piosouts aro handed round to
each and all, but not till St. Nicholas
has gone away aro tho lights turned
on and tho presents, oxamlnod.
Then tho chldron are hurried off to
bod, tired and happy, after which tho
oldortt gather for their own colebra
tlon. ,

ROCKEFELLER'S
MESSAGE READ
iried Operators to Get In Good
Graces oi the Public;
SENSATION AT THE HEARING
Dispatch Made Reference to an Arbi
trary Settlement Plan Advanced by
Colorado Mine Owners Through
Governor Ammons Introduced For
Purpose of Impeaching Rockefeller's
Testimony Before Committee.
Dener, Dec. G. A telegram from
John D. Rockefeller, Jr., to Jesse F.
Wclborn, president, and L. M. Bow
ers, chairman, of the board of Colo
rado Fuel and Iron company, created
a sensation at the hearing of the fed
eral commission on Industrial rela
tions. This message, Instructing the local
men to do certain things calculated to
entrench the coal operators In the
good graces of the public, was pro
cured In mysterious manner by tho
miners' union and copies wore sub
mitted to the federal commission, to
be Introduced later as evidence
Welborn admitted the authenticity
of tho telegram, which Is Introduced
for the puipose of Impeaching the
testimony of John D. Rockefoller, Jr.,
Eh en before the congressional com
mittee, denjlng that he had any ac
tive connection with the operators'
conduct of the strike.
The telegram made reference to an
nibltrary settlement plan which had
been advanced by the operators
through Governor Ammons and Rock
efeller concluded by saying:
"It seems to us that the operators
should call Dr. Foster's attention
(meaning Representative Foster of Il
linois) to these facts and reiterate
their willingness to accept this settle
ment. By so doing they will place
themselves In a very strong position
before the public in that It would be
6vldont that all dlsordertlplnce Nov.
27, has been duo to the refusal of tho
union to accept the settlement which
was proposed by tho governor nnd ac
cepted by the operators, hut i ejected
by the miners. Unless In tho mean
time there has been an important
change In the situation, ns stockhold
ers and directors wo strongly urgo
that tho opciators make reply to Dr.
Foster nlong these lines."
Former United States Sonator Pat
terson concluded his testimony by
making a strong plea for a compul
sory arbitration law, intimating that
tho operators by refusing to meet tho
men In conference considered that all
men nro not born equal. He said such
a law was necessary to bring tho op
erators to their senses.

WILKIN'S DEATH
WAS UNEXPECTED
Supreme Judge Passed Away
SuoMy at His Home.
A VICTIM OF HEART DISEASE
Judge Keenly Dlsapoolnted at His De
feat For Re-election to the Supreme
Bench Qhlef Justice Nichols and
Surviving Judges to Attend the
Funeral In a Body Sketch of Wil
kin's Career,
Columbus, Dec. 5 Chief Justice
Nichols nnd the surviving Judges of
tho supreme court will attend in a
body the funeral of Judge J. Foster
Wilkin of the supreme court, who fell
dead In his home In New Philadelphia.
Death was due to heart disease and
followed a seizure two weeks ago,
while the Jurist was walking from his
apartments In the Lincoln hotel hero
to tho Judiciary building. Ho appar
ently recovered, but was advised to
go homo for a'rest, which he did. His
illness took a serious turn several
days ago, but his death was wholly
unexpected. Thursday he dictated a
hopeful letter to Judge Osca"- W. New
man of the supreme court, but did not
have strength to sign It. In it he
said ho was able to be up and about
but still was very weak, yet he ex
pected to be back at work In the court
by Monday.
Judge Wilkin suffered a nervous
breakdown after the election, at which
he was defeated for a second term.
He was keenly disappointed at his
defeat and his friends and associates
in the judiciary building say It un
doubtedly was a contributing factor
In his Illness and death.
Judge Wilkin was sixty-three years
old. Ho was a Virginian by birth and
was graduated at the University o
Virginia. Some thirty years ago he
served two terms as prosocuting at
torney of Tuscarawas county, and
white holding that office gained local
fame by driving a sot of grafters out
of office.
This was the only public position
ho ever hold until his election to tho
supreme bench In 1912. He was a
Democrat and was renominated at
the Democratic primaries last Au
gust, but failed of election on the non
partisan ballot.
He leaves a widow and six sons
and two daughters. Of the sons, Da
vid L. and Wilbur are attorneys in
Cleveland, Robert Is an attorney at
Now Philadelphia, Reed Is a law stu
dent at O. S. U., James F. and the
sixth son are In business in the state
of Washington. The two daughters,
one a widow, are at the family homo
In New Philadelphia. Mrs. Wilkin
was Beriously 111 at tho time the Judge
contracted his Illness, but recovered.
