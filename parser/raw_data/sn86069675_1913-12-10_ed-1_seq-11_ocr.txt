THE MESSAGE.
President Wilsons General
mosagc to Congress follows the
precedents set by his special mes
sages in brevity, Ufcidity and
pointcdncss. He has broken a
way from the custom of making
the annual message a ponderous
omnibus for -the conveyance of
personal preachments on this,
that and 'nothing, and of the
lumber of the various depart
ments, addressing himself di
rectly to the topics which- he
deems of present greatest mo
ment. This is a most welcome
departure from the policy of his
immediate predecessor in partic
ular, who, not content with issu
ing a daily dissertation from the
White House, utilize the oppor
tunity of his annual message for
the verbose demonstration of his
cocksurencss about everything
(always excepting the tariff)
this side of infinity and eternity
-i not a little beyond.
Theodore Roosevelt broke all
records as a breaker of preced
ents, but Woo.drow Wilson has
done more and better by break
ing this one precedent than
Roosevelt did by breaking a hun
dred. So admirable is the result that
it is no longer necessary to sum
marize the message for the busy
reader. It is compressed in a
compass to make it quickly read
able, and it should be read' by
everyone who wishes to know
what the President thinks about
our foreign relations, about rural
credits, about anti-trust legisla
tion, about presidential prima
ries and national party conven
tions, about our insular wards,
the development of Alaska and
the improvement of labor condi
tions in the mines, on the rail
roads and at sea.
He has nothing new to say
about Mexico, contenting himself
with a denunciation of the Hue
rta usurpation and with a reiter
ation of his "waiting and watch
ing" policy, jsatisficd that the
collapse of Huerta is not far a
way. He seems, as he has seem
ed all along, to have more faith
in Mexico's qualifications for
self-government that is justi
fied by Mexican history or Mex
ican conditions. Huerta's down
fall may be inevitable, as Mr.
Wilson thinks, but why he
should think that Huerta's
downfall would be followed by
constitutional government in
Mexico is not apparent. Un
doubtedly his policy of watching
and waiting is a far more com
mendable policy than the policy
of intervention urged by our jin
goes andour exploiters of the
John Hays Hammond dollar
mark, but how much better pol
icy it would have been if, dis
carding the mischievous Roose
velt pervasion of the Monroe
doctrine and disabusing himself
of the notion that it is for the
United States to dictate the
standard of government or mor
als of Latin America, he had
blazed out as the Wilson doctrine
that it is for the United States
to work out its own ideals in its
own territory, without essaying
to lay down standards of gov
ernment or morals for peoples
for whom we have no responsi
bility and over whom wc have
no authority save that which we
may assume in short, if he had
set his jaw and made up his
mind that, in so far as he was
able to effect it, we were going
to mind our own business and
leave other nations to mind
theirs ! Courier-Journal.
You can fool a fool the same
way three or four times.

WANAMAKER AND
ADVERTISING
In an address delivered in
Philadelphia recently John Wan
amakcr said the first necessity of
success in retail trade is good
merchandise. He added that
good advertising is "quite as
much of a necessity to a busi
ness that is to keep up a healthy
growth."
"If you have in your shop,"
said Mr. Wanamakcr, "exactly
what 500,000 people of this city
want, but only 500 of them know
you have it, the care and energy
you have expended in maintain
ing a stock of high quality will
do little good, either to your cus
tomers or to your business."
Mr. Wanamakcr may be con
sidered an authority on adver
tising, for there has been no
more consistent advertiser in all
the history of the United States.
He is one of the country's great
est merchants. He began busi
ness on a rather meager basis,
but by judicious use of the news
papers, he let all Philadelphia
know what he had to sell, and
increased his establishment and
his outlay for publicity until he
made the name of Wanamakcr
known around the world.
In the half -a century or more
that the Wanamaker store has
grown from nothingness to its
present proportions thousands of
stores in Philadelphia have come
and gone without leaving a rip
ple on the city's commercial sur
face. Honest merchants, many
of them, who dealt in good goods
and gave their customers a
square deal, but they cither neg
lected the publicity end of the
business or botched it so badly
that they got no results. "The
satisfaction of knowing that your
name stands for good merchan
dise," said Mr. Wanamaker in
his recent address, "is a great
thing certainly, but it is not apt
to be greatly profitable unless
the public at large knows it also."
The retail merchant who docs
not advertise cannot hope to
build up a big, growing and en
during business. All merchants
it is true, cannot be Wanamak
er's, but there is no merchant
who cannot enlarge his trade by
intelligent advertising.

EGG BOYCOTT
Eggs are to be banished from
the tables in the home of nearly
all the Cabinet members whose
wives have pledged their sup
port to the egg boycott campaign
which is being waged to reduce
the price. One of the first to
give her support and join tnc
movement was Mrs. William
Jennings Bryan, wife of the
Secretary of State.
"Any subject that touches the
home touches the heart of every
woman, whoever she is' is what
Mrs. Bryan told Mrs. Ellis Lo
gan, a leader in the boycott
movement in Washington, when
she called upon Mrs. Bryan to
obtain her support. Mrs. Bryan
assured Mrs. Logan that she was
in thorough accord with the
movement.
Following Mrs. Bryan's lead 1
nearly all the other Cabinet I
wives have joined the effort to
lower the egg prices. Pledges
have been obtained from Mrs.
Lindscy M. Garrison, wife of
the Secretary of War; Mrs. Al
bert S. Burleson, wife of the
Postmaster General; Mrs. David
P. Houston, wife of the Secre
tary of Agriculture, and Mrs.
William B. Wilson, wife of the
Secretary of Labor.
A monster petition is being
prepared with which Congress
is to be stormed by Mrs. Logan
and her co-workers.
