ance—Denounces Lynching.
Washington, Dec. 4.—Demanding that
fleath be the penalty for rape and calling
for the enactment of a national law
.governing divorces, President Roosevelt's
message was read to the two branches of
congress today and was greeted with
cheers. The president sticks to phonetic
spelling to some extent but uses the old
fashioned style in most cases. Prominent
among the features of the document are
JWr. Roosevelt's recommendation that a
law be passed prohibiting all corporations
from contributing to campaign funds, a
Haw such as has already been passed by
one branch of congress, his declaration
that It would be wrong to prevent the use
ol' Injunctions, his bitter denunciation of
Vnching, his good words for the further
ance of a general eight hour day, his de
mand for a "thoro" probe into the ques
tion of woman and child labor, his as
sertion that it is wise that progress along
Inheritance tax lines should be gradual,
His urging of the passage of a ship sub
sidy bill, his statement that the present
currency system is seriously defective and
his warning to. Cuba that she must be
good. The president also declares that the
•White race cannot afford to let the negroes
srow up in ignorance, says the income
tax stands on an' entirely different footing
Srom the inheritance tax because it in
volves no question of the perpetuation of
fortunes "swollen to an unhealthy size,"
and calls the attention of congress to the
'.need of passing a bill limiting the hours of
employment of railroad employes. Mr.
Roosevelt states that effort should not
6e made to put combines out of business
but to prevent tiiem from doing injury to
the public. A 'particularly strong para
graph is that in which the chief executive
spanks the Pacific coast for its anti-Jap
anese sentiment and lauds the mikado's
country as a prime fi-iend of Uncle Sam.
The muck raking magazine writers come
In for some caustic remarks.
The message starts out by saying:
As a nation we still continue to enjoy
fi literally unprecedented prosperity and
It is probable that only reckless specula
tion and disregard of legitimate business
methods on the part of the business world
can materially mar this prosperity.
Congress is then complimented and the
president next takes up the matter of
corporation contributions to campaign
?unds. He says:
I again recommend a law prohibiting all
corporations from contributing to the
campaign expenses of any .party. Such a
|iill has already past one house of con
gress. Let individuals contribute as they
desire hut let us prohibit in effective
fashion all corporations from making con
tributions for any political purpose, di
rectly or indirectly.
Injunction.
Passing to the question of injunctions,
the president says:
In my last message I suggested the en
actment of a law in connection with the
issuance of injunctions, attention having
been sharply drawn to the matter by the
•aemand that the right of applying Injunc
tions in labor cases sho.uld be wholly abol
ished. It is at least doubtful whether a
jaw abolishing altogether the use of in
junctions in such cases would stand the
test of the courts in which case' of
course the legislation would be ineffective.
Moreover, 1 believe it would be wrong al
together to prohibit the use of injunctions.
It is criminal to p-ormlt sympathy for
Sriminals to weaken our hands in uphold
ing the law: and if men seek to destroy
life or property by mob violence there
Ehould be no impairment of the power of
the courts to deal with th-?m in the most
summary and effective way possible. But
Eo far as possible the abuse of the power
Ghotild be provided against by some such
\aw as I advocated last year.
Of course a judg* strong enough to be
fit tor his'office will enjoin any resort to
»'io!cncc or intimidation, especially by
conspiracy, no matter what his opinion
'/nay be of the rights of the original quar
rel. There must be no hesitation in deal
ing with disorder. But there must like
wise be no such abuse of tho- injunctive
power as is implied in forbidding laboring
men to strive for their own betterment in
peaceful and lawful ways: nor must the
Injunction be used merely to aid some big
corporation in carrying out schemes for
Us own aggrandizement. It must be re
membered that a preliminary injunction
In a labor case, if granted without ade
quate proof (even when authority can, be
•i found to support the conclusions of law
pn which it is founded), may often settle
the dispute between the parties and there
for^ if improperly granted may do irre
parable wrong.
Justice and Courage.
The two important elements of mora!
character in a judge are an earnest desire
to reach a just conclusion and courage
to enforce it Insofar as fear of public
comment does not affect the courage of a
judge, but only spurs him on to search his
conscience and to reach the result which
approves Itself to his inmotii- heart, such
comment serves a usefui put pose. There
are few men, whether they are judges for
life or for a shorter term, who do not pre
fer to earn and hold the respect of all, and
who cannot be reached and made to pause
and deliberate by hostile public criticism.
In the case of judges having a life tenure.
Indeed, their very independence makes the
right freely to comment on their decisions
ffif greater importance, because It is the
only practical and available instrument in
the hands of a free people to keep such
judges alive to the reasonable demands of
those they serve.
Lynching.
In connection with the delays of the law,
I call your attention and the attention of
the nation to the prevalence of crime
among us. and above all to the epidemic of
lynching and mob violence that springs up,
now »n one part of our country, now in
ttnotner. Eafrh section, north, south, east
or west, has its own faults no section can
with wisdom spend its time jeering at the
ta.ilIts of another section it should be busy
trying to amend its own shortcomings
To deal with the crime of corruption it is
necessary to have an awakened publ'c
conscience, and to sunplement this bv
whatever legislation will add speed and
•certainty in the .execution of the law
When we deal with lynching even more is
necessary. A great many white men arc
lynched, but. the crime is peculiarly fre
quent in respect to black men. The great
est existing cause of lynching is the per
petration, especially by black men, of the
nideous crime of rapf —the most abom
inable in all the category of crimes, even
••worse than murder. Mobs frequently
..Avenge the commission of this crime by
themselves torturing to death the man
committing it thus avenging in bestial
fashion a bestial deed, and reducing them
selves to a level with the criminal.
Lawlessness grows by what it feeds
Tipor. and "when mobs begin to lynch for
s-ape they speedily extend the sphere of
their operations and lynch for many other
kinds of crimes, so that two-thirds of the
'Jynchings a:f- not for rape at all while a
.-considerable proportion of the individuals
.lynched are innocent of all crime.
'if On His Real Worth.
Moreover, where any crime committed
*y a member of one race against a rnem
fcer of another race Is avenged in such
fashion that it seems as if not the indi
vidual criminal,,but the whole race, is at
tacked, the result is to exasperate to the
highest degree race feeling. There is but
'•one safe rule In dealing with black men as
"with white men it is the same rule that
..'-must be applied in dealing with rich men
Vs*nd poor men that is, to treat each man,
/whatever his color, his creed or his social
-imposition, with even-handed justice on his
ij^vjjreal worth as a man. White people owe
PW.
*,
ifc.*
yr.-s
it quite as much to themselves as to the
colored race tb treat well the colored man
who shows by his life that he-.deserves
such treatment: for it is suriely the high
est wisdom to encourage in the colored
race all those individuals who are hon
est, industrious, law-abiding, and who
therefore make good and safe neighbors
and citizens.
Reward or punish the individual on his
merits as an individual. Evil will surely
come in the end to both races if we sub
stitute for this just rule the habit of
treating all the member of the race, good
and bad, alike. There is no question of
"social equality" or "negro domination"
involved only the question of relentlessly
punishing bad men, and of securing to the
good man the right to his life, his liberty,
and the pursuit of his happiness as his
own qualities of heart, head and hand en
able him to achieve it
Every colored man should realize that
the worst enemy of his race is the negro
criminal, and above all the negro criminal
who commits the dreadful crime of rape
and it should be felt as in the highest de
gre an offense against the whole country,
and against the colored race in particular,
for a colored man to fall to help the
(Offi­
cers of the law in hunting down with all
possible earnestness and zeal every such
infamous offender.
Moreover, in my judgment, the crime of
rape should always be punished with
death, as is,the case with murder: assault
with intent to commit rape should be made
a capital crime, at least In the discretion
of the court and provision should be made
by which the punishment may follow im
mediately upon the heels of the offense
while the trial should be so conducted that
the victim need not bo wantonly shamed
while giving testimony, and that the least
possible publicity shall bo given to the de
tails.
The members of the white race on the
other hand should understand that every
lynching represents by just so much a
loosening of the bands of civilization that
the spirit of lynching inevitably throws
into prominence in the community all the
foul and evil creatures who dwell therein.
No man can take part in the torture of a
human being without having his own
moral nature permanently lowered. Every
lynching means just so much moral de
terioration in all the children who have
any knowledge of it, and therefore just so
much additional trouble for the next gen
eration of Americans.
Let justice be both sure and swift but
lot it be justice under the law. and not
the wild and crooked savagery of a mob.
As to the Schools.
The free public school, tho chance for
each boy or girl to get a good elementary
education, lies at the foundation of our
whole political situation. In every com
munity tho poorest citizens, those who
need the schools mgst, would be deprived
of them if they only received school fa
cilities proportioned to tho taxes they
paid. This is as true of one portion of
our country as of another. It is as true
for the negro as for the white man.
The white man, il' he is wise, will de
cline to allow the negroes in a mass to
grow to manhood and womanhood with
out education. Unquestionably educa
tion such as is obtained in our public
schools does not do everything towards
making a man a good citizcn but it does
much. The lowest and most brutal crim
inals, those for instance who commit the
crime of rape, are in the great majority
men who have hat! either no education
or very little just as they are almost
invariably men who own no property
for the man who puts money by out of
his earnings, like the man who acquires
education, is usually lifted above mere
brutal criminality.
Of course, the best type of education
for the colored man, taken as a whole,
is such education as is conferred in
schools like Hampton and Tuskegee
where the boys and girls, the young men
and young women, are trained indus
trially as well as in the ordinary pub
lic school branches. The graduates of
these schools turn out well in the great
majority of cases, and hardly any of
them become criminals, while what little
criminality there is never takes the form
of that brutal violence which invites
lynch law.
Capita! and Labor.
In dealing with both labor and capital,
with the questions affecting both corpo
rations and trades unions, there is one
matter more important to remember than
aught else, and that is the infinite harm
done by preachers of mere discontent.
These are the men who seek to excite a
violent class hatred against all men of
wealth. They seek to turn wise and
proper movements for the better control
of corporations and for doing away with
the abuses connected with wealth into a
campaign of hysterical, excitement and,
falsehood in which the aim is to inflame*
to -madness the brutal passions of man
kind.
The sinister demagogues and. foolish vis
ionaries who are always eager to un
dertake such a campaign of destruction
sometimes seek to associate themselves
with those working for a genuine reform
in governmental and social methods, and
sometimes masquerade as such reform
ers.
In reality they are tho worst enemies
of the cause they profess to advocate,
just as the purveyors of sensational
slander in newspaper or magazine are
the worst enemies of all men who are
engaged In on honest effort to better
what is bad in our social and govern
mental conditions.
To preach hatred of the rich man as
such, to carry on a campaign of slander
and invective against him, to seek to
mislead and inflame to madi-t« honest
men whose lives are hard and who have
not the kind of mental training which
will permit them to appreciate the dan
ger in the doctrines preached—all this
is to commit a crime against the body
politic and to be false to every worthy
principle and tradition of American na
tional life.
Moreover, while such preaching and
such agitation may give a livelihood and
a certain notoriety to some of those who
take part in it, and may result in the
temporary political success of others, in
the long run every such movement will
either fail or else will provoke a violent
reaction, which will itself result not
merely in undoing the mischief wrought
by tne demagogue and the agitator, but
also in undoing the good that the honest
reformer, the true upholder of popular
rights, has painfully and laboriously
achieved.
Corruption is never so rife as in com
munities where tho demagogue and the
agitator bear full .sway, because in such
communities all moral bands become
loosened,-and hysteria and sensationalism
replace the spirit of sound judgment and
fair dealing as between m.xii and man.
The plain people who think the me
chanics, farmers, merchants, workers
with head or hand, the men to whom
American traditions are dear, who love
their country and try to net decently bv
their neighbors, owe it to themselves tb
remember that the most damaging blow
that can be given popular government is
to eiect an unworthy and sinister agitator
on a platform of violence and hypocrisy.
Whenever such an issue is ra:« in
this countrj- nothing can be gained bv
flinching from it, for in such case democ
racy is itself on trial, popular self gov
ernment under republican "forms is itself
on trial. The triumph of the mob is
just as evil a thing as the triumph of
the plutocracy, and to have escaped one
danger avails nothing whatever if we
succumb to tho other.
Railroad Employes.
I call your attention to the need /if
passing the bill limiting the number of
hours of employment of railroad em
ployes. The measure is a very moderate
one and I can conceive of no serious ob
jection to it. Indeed, so far as it is in
our power, it should be our aim steadily
to reduce the number of hours of labor,
with as a goal the general introduction
of &n eigh-hour day.
Child-Woman Labcr.
Congress at its last session-wisely pro
vided for a truant court for the District
of Columbia a marked step in advance
on the path of properly caring for the
children. Let me again urge that the
congress provide for a thorough investi
gation of the conditions of child labor
and of the labor of women in the United
States.
The horrors incident to the employment
of young children in factories or at" work
anywhere are a blot on our civilization.
It is true that each state must ultimate
ly settle the question in its own way
but a thorough official investigation of
the matter, with the results published
broadcast, would greatly help toward
arousing the public conscience and secur
ing unity of state action in the matter.
Among the excellent laws which the
congress passed at the last session was
an employers' liability law. It was a
marked step in advance to get the recog
nition of employers' liability on the stat
ute books: but the law did not go far
enough. Iu spite of ail precautions ax-
ercised by employers there are unavoid
able accidents and even deaths Involved
in nearly every line of business connected
with the mechanic arts. This Inevitable
sacrifice of life may be reduced, to a
minimum, but it cannot be completely
eliminated. It is a great social Injus
tice to compel the employe, or rather the
family of the killed or disabled victim,
to bear, the entire burden of such an
inevitable sacrifice. In other words, so
ciety shirks its duty by laying the whole
cost on the victim, whereas the Injury
comes from what may be called the legi
timate risks of the trade. Compensation
for accidents or deaths due in any line
of industry to the actual conditions un
der which that industry is carried, on,
should be paid by that portion of tho
community for the benefit of which the
Industry is carried on—that is, by those
who profit by the industry. If the en
tire trade risk is placed upon the em
ployer he will promptly and properly add
It to the legitimate cost of production and
assess it proportionately upon tho con
sumers of his commodity. It is therefore
clear to my mind that the law should
place this entire "risk of a trade" upon
the employer. Neither the federal law,
nor, as far as I am informed, the state
laws dealing with the question of em
ployers' liability are sufficiently thor
oughgoing. The federal law should of
course include employes in navy yards,
arsenals and the like.
Labor Disputes.
The cBfiimlssion appointed by the presi
dent October 16, 1902, at the request of
both the anthracite coal operators and
miners, to inquire into, consider and pass
upon the questions in controversy in con
nection with the strike in the anthracite
regions of Pennsylvania and the causes
out of which the controversy arose, in
their report, findings and award ex
pressed tho belief "that the state and
federal governments should provide the
machinery for what may be called the
compulsory investigation of controversies
between employers and employes when
they arise." This expression of belief is
deserving of the favorable consideration
of the congress and the enactment of its
provisions into law. A bill has already
been introduced to this end.
Records show that during the twenty
years from January 1, 18S1, to December
31 19C0, there were strikes affecting 117,
509 establishments, and 0,105,694 employes
were thrown out of employment. During
the same period there were 1,005 lockouts,
Involving nearly 10,000 establishments,
throwing over 1,000,000 people out* of em
ployment.
Many of these strikes and lockouts
would not have occurred had the parties
to the dispute been required to appear be
fore an unprejudiced body representing
the nation, face to face, state.the reasons
for th-eir' contention. In most instances
the dispute would doubtless be found to
be due to a misunderstanding by each
of the other's rights, aggravated by an
unwillingness of either party to accept as
true the statements of the other as to the
justice or injustice of the matters in dis
pute.
Tho exercise of a judicial spirit by a dis
interested body representing the federal
government, such as would be provided
by a commission on concilation and arbi
tration would tend to create on atmos
phere of friendliness and concilation be
tween contending parties and the giving
each side an equal opportunity to present
fully its case in the presence of the other
would prevent many disputes from' de
veloping into serious strikes or lockouts,'
and, in other cases, would enable the com
mission to persuade the opposing parties
to come to terms.
In this age of great corporate and labor
combinations, neither employers nor em
ployes should be left completely at the
mercy of* the stronger party to a dispute,
regardless of the righteousness of -their
respective, claims. The proposed measure
would be In the line of securing recogni
tion of the fact that in many strikes the
public has itself an interest which can
not wisely be disregarded an interest no!
merely of general convenience, for th«
question of a just and proper public policy
must also be considered.
Coal Land Withdrawal.
It is not wise that the nation should
alienate its remaining coal lands. I liavo
temporarily withdrawn from settlement
all the lands which the geological survey
has indicated as containing, or in all prob
ability containing, coal. The question,
however, can be properly settled only by
legislation, which in my judgment should
provide for the withdrawal of these lands
from sale or from entry, save in certain
especial circumstances. The ownership
would then remain in the United States,
which should not, however, attempt to
work them, but permit them to be worked
by private individuals under a royalty
system, the government keeping such con
trol as to permit it to see that no exces
sive price was charged consumers.
It would, of course, be as necessary to
supervise the rates charged by the com
mon carriers to transport the product ast
the rates charged by those who mine it
and the supervision must extend to the
conduct of the common carriers, so that
they shall in no way favor one competitor
at the expense of another. The with
drawal cf these coal lands would consti
tute a policy analagous to that which has
been followed in withdrawing the forest
lands from ordinary settlement. The coal,
like the forest, should be treated as the
property of the public and its disposal
should be under conditions which would
inure to the benefit o. the public as a
whole.
Corporations.
The present congress has taken long
strides in the direction of securing proper
supervision and control by the national
government over corporations engaged in
interstate business— and the enormous
majority of corporations of any size are
engaged in interstate business.
The passage of the railway rate bill, and
only to a less degree the passage of the
pure food bill, and the provision for in
creasing and rendering more effective na
tional control over the beef-packing in
dustry, mark an important, advance in
the proper direction. In the short session
it will perhaps be difficult to do much
further along this line: and it may be
best to wait until tht laws have been in
operation for a number of months before
endeavoring to increase their scope.
During the last five months the rail
roads have shown increased earnings and
some of them unusual dividends while
during the same period the mere taki/ig
effect of the law has produced an unpre
cedented. a hitherto unheard of, number
of voluntary reductions in freights and
fares by the railroads. Since the founding
of the commission there has never been
a time of equal length in which anything
like so rrany reduced tariffs have been
put into effect. On August 27, for instance,
two days before the new law went into
effect, the commission received notices* of
over 5.0!# separate tariffs which represent
ed reductions from previous rates.
It must not be supposed, however, that
with the passage of these laws it will be
possible to stop progress along the line of
increasing the power of the national gov
ernment ever the use of capital in inter
state commerce. For example, there will
ultimately be need of enlarging the pow
ers of the interstate commerce commis
sion along several different lines, so as to
give it a larger and more efficient control
over the railroads.
It can not too often be repeated that
experience has conclusively shown the im
possibility of securing by the actions of
nearly-half a hundred different state legis
latures anything but ineffective chaos in
the way of dealing with the groat corpor
ations which do not operate exclusively
within the limits of any one state.
In some method, whether by a national
license law or in oiher fashion, we mu-t
exercise, and that at an early date a far
more complete control than at present
over these great corporations—a control
that will among other things prevent the
evils of excessive overcapitalization and
that will compel the disclosure by'each
big corporation of its stockholders and of
Its properties and business, whether own
ed directly or through subsidiary or affi
liated corporations.
This will tend to put a stop to the secur
ing of inordinate profits by favored indi
viduals at the expense whether of the gen
eral public, the stockholders, or the wage
workers. Our effort should be not so much
to prevent consolidation as such, but so
to supervise and control it as to see that
it results in no harm to the people. The
reactionary or ultraconservative apolo
gists for the misuse of wealth assail the
effort to secure such control as a step to
ward socialism. As a matter of fact it is
these reactionaries and ultraconservatives
who are themselves most potent in in
creasing socialistic feeling. One of the
most efficient methods of averting the
consequences of a dangerous agitation,
which is 80 per cent, wrong, is to remedy
the 20 per cent, of evil as to which the
agitation is well founded. The best way
1
to avert the very undesirable move for
the government ownership of railways Is
to secure by the government on behadf of
the people as a whole such adequate con
trol and regulation of the great Interstate
common carriers as will do away with the
evils which give rise to the- agitation
against them.
So the proper antidote to the dangerous
and wicked agitation against the men of
wealth as such Is to secure by proper leg
islation and executive action the abolition
of the grave abuses which actually do ob
tain in connection with the business use
of wealth under our present system—or
rather no system—of failure to exercise
.any adequate control at all,
Thei reactionaries and the violent ex
tremists show symptoms of joining hands
against us. Both assert, for instance, that
if logical, we -should go to government
ownership or railroads and the like the
reactionaries, because on such an issue
they think the people would stand with
them, while the extremists care rather to
preach discontent and agitation than to
achieve solid results.
As a matter of "fact, bur position Is as
remote from -that of tho bourbon reactlon
ary as from that of the impracticable' or
sinister visionary. We hold that the gov
ernment should not conduct the business
of tho nation, but that it should exercise
such supervision as will insure its being
conducted in the interest of the naMon.
Our aim is, so far as may be, to secure,
for all decent, hard working men, equt-lity
of opportunity and equality of burden.
The actual working of our laws has
shown that the effort to prohibit all com
blnatlon, good or bad, is noxious where
it is not ineffective. Combination of cap
ital like combination of labor is a neces
sary element of our present Industrial
system.
It is not possible completely to prevent
it and if it were possible, such complete
prevention would do damage to the body
politic.
What we need is not vainly to try to
prevent all combination, Jiut to secure such
rigorous and adequate control and super
vision of the combinations as to prevent
their injuring the public.
Two Taxes.
Tho question of taxation is difficult in
any country, but it is especially difficult
In ours with its federal system of govern
ment. Some taxes should on every ground
be levied In a small district for use in that
district. Thus the taxation of real estate
is peculiarly one for the Immediate local
ity In which the real estate is found.
Again, there is no more legitimate tax
for any state than a tax on the franchises
conferred by that state upon street rail
roads and similar corporations which op
erate wholly within the state boundaries,
sometimes in one and sometimes in several
municipalities or other minor divisions of
the state.
But there are many kinds of taxes which
can only be levied by the general govern
ment so as to produce the best results,
because, among other reasons, the at
tempt to impose them In one particular
6tate too often results merely in driving
the corporation or Individual affected to
some other locality or other state.
The national government has long de
rived its chief revenue from a tariff on
imports and from an internal or excise
tax. In addition to these there is every
reason why, when next our system of tax
ation is revised, the national government
should impose a graduated inheritance
1 ttix, and, If possible, a graduated income
tax.
The man of great wealth owes a pecu
liar obligation to the state, because he de
rives special advantages from the mere
existence of government. Not only should
ho recognize this obligation in the way
he leads his daily life and in the way he
earns and spends his money, but it should
also be recognized by the way In which
he pays for the protection the state gives
him.
On the one hand, it is desirable that he
should assume his full and proper share
of the burden of taxation on the other
hand, it is quite as necessary that in this
kind of taxation, where the men who vote
the tax pay but little of it, there should
be clear recognition of the danger of in
augurating any such system save In a
spirit of entire justice and moderation.
Exactly how far the Inheritance tax
would, as an incident, have the effect of
limiting the transmission by devise or gift
of the enormous fortunes in question it is
not necessary at present to discuss.
It is wise that progress in this direction
should be gradual.
At first a permanent national inheritance
tax, while it might be more substantial
than any such tax has hitherto been, need
not approximate, either in amount or in
the extent of the increase by graduation,
to what such a tax should ultimately be.
On Different Footing.
In its incidents, and apart from the
main purpose of raising revenue, an in
come tax stands on an entirely different
footing from an inheritance tax because
it involves no question of the perpetua
tion of fortunes swollen to an unhealthy
size. The question is in its essence a
question of the proper adjustment of bur
dens to benefits. As the law now stands
it is undoubtedly difficult to devise a na
tional income tax which shall be consti
tutional. But whether it is absolutely im
possible is another question and if pos
sible it is most certainly desirable. Tho
first purely income-tax law was passed by
I the congress in 1SG1, but the most import
ant law dealing with the subject was that
of 1894. This the court held to be uncon
stitutional.
The question is undoubtedly very Intri
cate, delicate, and troublesome. The de
cislon of the court was only reached by
one majority. It is the law of the land,
and* of course is accepted as such and
loyally obeyed by all good citizens. Never
theless, the hesitation evidently felt by
I the court as a whole in coming to a con
elusion, when considered together with
the previous decisions on the subject, may
perhaps indicate the possibility of devising
a constitutional income-tax law which
I shall substantially accomplish the results
aimed at. The difficulty of amending
I the constitution is so great that
only real necessity can justify a
resort thereto. Every effort should be
made in dealing with this subject, as with
the subject of the proper control bv the
national government over the use of cor
porate wealth in interstate business, to
devise legislation which without such uc
tion shall attain the desired end but if
this fails, there will ultimately be no al
ternatlve to a constitutional amendment,
Agricultural.
I The only other persons whose welfare is
as vital to the welfare of the whole coun
try as is the welfare of the wagexvorkers
arc the tillers of the soil, the farmers. It
Is a mere truism to say that no growth of
cities, no growth of wealth, no industrial
development can atone for any falling off
In the character and standing of the l'arm-

1
population. During the last few dec-
ades this fact litis been recognized with
Rver-inoreasing clearness. There is no
longer any failure to realize that farming,
at least in curtain branches, must become
I a. technical and scientific profession. This
means that there must be open to farmers
the chance for technical and scientific
training, not theoretical merely but of the
most severely practical type. The farmer
represents a peculiarly high type of Amer
ican citizenship, and he must have the
same chance to rlsi- and develop as other
American citizens have.
Irrigation.
Much is now being done for the states
of the Rocky Mountains and Great Plains
through the development of the national
policy of irrigation and forest preserva
tion no government policy for the better
ment of our internal conditions has been
more fruitful of good than this. The for
ssts of the White mountains and Southern
Appalachian regions should also be pre
served and they cannot be unless the peo
ple of the states in which they lie, through
their representatives the congress, se
cure vigorous action by '.he national gov
ernment.
Marriage-Divorce.
I I am well aware of how difficult It is to
pass a constitutional amendment, is'ev
M'thcless in my judgment the whole ques
tion of marriage and divorce should be
I relegated to the authority of the national
pongress. At present the wide differences
in the laws of the different states on this
subject result in scandals and abuses and
surely there is nothing so vitally essen
tial to the welfare of the nation, nothing
around which the nation should so b«-nd
itself to throw every safeguard, as the
home life of the average citizen. The
"hinge would be good om every stand
point. In particular it would be good be
I :ause it would confer on the congress the
power at once to deal radically and ef-
Iciently with polygamy and this should
oe done whether or not marriage and, di

The Subsidy Issue.
Let me once again call the attention of
the congress to two subjects concerning
which I have frequently before communi
cated with them. One is the question of
developing American shipping. I trust
that a law embodying in substance the
views, or a major part of the views, ex
pressedin the report on this tiubject laid
before tho house at its last session will be
passed. I am well aware that in former
years objectionable measures have been
proposed in reference to the encourage
ment of American shipping but it soems
to me that the proposed measure. Is -as.
nearly unobjectionable as any can be! It
w.ll of course benefit primarily our sea-'
°ozVrJ ®tates such as Maine, Louisiana
and Washington but what benefits part
of our people in the end benefits all just
as government aid to irrigation and for
estry in the west is really of benefit, not
only to the Rocky mountain staites, but
to all our country. If It prove impractic
able to enact a law for the encouragement
of shipping generally, then at least provi
sion should bo made for better communi
cation with South America, notably for
fast mail lines to the chief South Ameri
can ports. It is discreditable to Us that
our business people, for lack of direct
communication in the shape of lines of
steamers with South America, should In
that great sister continent bo at a disad
vantage compared to the business people
of Europe.
Currency Reform.
I especially call your attention to the
second subject, the condition of our cur
rency laws. The national bank act has
ably served a great purpose in aiding the
enormous business development of the
country and within ten years there has
been an increase in circulation per capita
from $21.41 to $38.03. For several years
evidence has been accumulating that ad
ditional legislation Is needed. The re
currence of each crop season emphasizes
the defects of the present laws. There
must soon be st revision cf them, be
cause to leave, them as they are '.means
to incur liability of business disaster.
Since your body adjourned there has been
a fluctuation in the interest on call money
from 2 per cent, to 30 per cent. and the
fluctuation was even greater during the
preceding six months.
The secretary of the treasury had to
step in and by wise action put a stop to
the most violent period of oscillation.
Even worse th:tn such fluctuation Is the
advance in commercial rates and the un
certainty felt in the sufficiency of credit
even at high rates. All commercial in
terests suffer during each crop period.
Excessive rates for call money in New
York attract money from tho Interior
banks into the speculative field: this de
pletes the fund that would otherwise be
available for commercial uses, and com
mercial borrowers are forced to pay ab
normal rates so that each fall a tax,
in the shape of increased interest charges,
is placed on the whole commerce of the
country.
The mere statement of these facts
shows that our present system is seri
ously defective. There Is need of a
change.
Unfortunately, however, many of the
proposed changes must be ruled from
consideration because they are compli
cated, are not easy of "comprehension,
and tend to disturb existing rights and
interests. We must also rule out any
plan which would materially impair the
value of tho United States 2 per cent,
bonds now pledged to secure circulation,
the Issue of which was made under con
dition's peculiarly creditable to th»» treas
ury. I do not press any especial plan.
Various plans have recently been pro
posed by expert committees of bankers.
Among the plans which are possibly
feasible and which certainly should re
ceive your consideration is that repeat
edly brought to your attention by the
present secretary of the treasury, the
essential features of which have been
approved by many prominent bankers
and business men. According to this plan
national banks should be permitted to
issue a specified proportion of their cap
ital in notes of a given kind, the issue
to bo taxed at so high a. rate as to drive
the notes back when not wanted in legi
timate trade. This plan would not per
mit the issue of currency to give banks
additional profits, but to meet the emer
gency presented by times of stringency.
To Prevent Spasms.
I do not say that this is the right
system. I only advance It to emphasize
my belief that there is need for the adop
tion of some system which shall be au
tomatic and open to all sound banks,
so as to avoid all possibility of discrim
ination and favoritism. Such a plan
would tend to prevent the spasms of
high money and speculation which now
obtain in tho New York market for
at present there is too much currency at
certain seasons of the year, and its ac
cumulation at New York tempts bankers
to lend it at low rates for speculative
purposes whereas at other times when
the crops are being moved there Is urgent
need for a large but temporary increase
In the currency supply.
It must never be forgotten that this
question concerns business men generally
quite as much as bankers especially is
this true of stockmen, farmers and busi
ness men in the west for at present at
certain seasons of the year the difference
in interest rates between the east and
the west is from 6 to 10 per cent., where
as in Canada the corresponding difference
is but 2 per cent. Any plan must, of
course, guard the interests of western
and southern bankers as. Jarefully as it
guards the interests of New York or Chi
cago bankers and must bo drawn from
the standpoints of the farmer and the
merchant no less than from the stand
points of the city banker and the country
banker.
The law should be amended so as spe
cifically to provide that the funds derived
from customs duties may be treated by
the secretary of the treasury as he treats
funds obtained under the internal rev
enue laws. There should lae a consid
erable increase in bills of small denomi
nations. Permission should be given
banks, if necessary under settled re
strictions, to retire their circulation to a
larger amount than $3,000,000 a month.
Philippine Tariff.
I most earnestly hope that the bill to
provide a lower tariff for or else absolute
free trade in Philippine products will be
come a law. No harm will come to any
American industry: and while there wlil
be some small but real material benefit
to the Filipinos, the main benefit will
come by the showing made as to our pur
pose to lo all in our nower for their
welfare. So for our action in the Phil
ippines has been abundantly justified,
not mainly and indeed not primarilv be
cause of the added dignity it has given
us as a nation by proving that we are
capable honorably and efficiently to bear
the international burdens which'a mighty
people should bear, but even more be
cause of the immense benefit that has
come to the people of the Philippine
islands.
In these islands we are stcadilv intro
ducing both liberty and order, to a great
er di-groe than their people have ever
before known. Wo have secured justice.
We have provided an efficient police
force, and have put down ladronism. Only
in the islands of Leyte and Samar is the,
f.uthority of our government resisted and
this by wild mountain tribes under the
superstitious inspiration of fakirs and
pseudo-religious leaders.
We are constantly increasing the meas
ure of liberty accorded the islanders, and
ii"xt spring, if conditions warrant,
shall take a great stride forward in test
ing their capacity for self government
by summoning the first Filipino legisla
tive assembly and the way in which thev
stand this test will largely determin'e
whether the self government thus grant
ed will be increased or decreased: "for if
we have erred at all in the Philippines
it has been in proceeding too rapidIv in
the direction of granting a large measure
of self government. We re building
roads. We have, for the immeasurable
good of the people, arranged for the
bull-ling of railroads. Let us also see
to it that they are given free access to
our market*. This nation owes no more
imperative duty to itself and mankind
than the duty of managing the affairs
of all the islands under the American
flag—the Philippines, Porto Uico and Ha
waii—so as to make it evident that it is
in every way to their advantage that
the flag should fly over them.
Porto Rico.
American citizenship should be con
ferred on the citizens of Porto Rico. The.
harbor of San Juan in Porto Rico should
be dredged and improved. The expenses
of the federal court of Porto Rico should
be met from the federal treasury.''

nothing. All we have a right to question
is the man's conduct. If he is honest and
upright in his dealings with his neigh*

Especially do we need to remember our
duty to tho stranger within bur gates.
It is the sure mark of a low civilization,
a low morality, to abuso or discriminate
against or in any way humiliate such
stranger who has come here lawfully and
who is conducting himself properly. To
remember this is Incumbent on every
American citizen, and It is of e.oursc pc.
eullarly incumbent on every government
official, whether of the nation or of th«
several states.
Japan as a Friend.
I am prompted to say this by the at
titude of hostility hero and there assumed
toward the Japanese in this country:
This hostility Is sporadic and Is limited
to a very few places. Nevertheless, it is
most discreditable to us as a people, and
it may be fraught with the gravest con
sequences to the nation,
1
he friendship between the United
States and Japan has been continuoui
since the time,, over half a century ago,
when Commodore Perry, by his expedi
tion to Japan, first opened the Islands
to western civilization. She has pro
duced great generals and mighty ad«
mirals her lighting men, afloat and
ashore, show all the heroic courage, ili«
unquestioning, unfaltering loyalty, tlia
splendid indifference to hardship and
death," which marked the Loyal Konluef
and they show slso that-they possess tha
highest ideal of patriotism. Japanese
artists of every kind see their products
eagerly sought for in all lands. The in
dustrial and commercial development ol
Japan has been phenomenal greatei
than that of any other country dr.rinft
the same period.
Our nation fronts on the Pacific, jusl
as it fronts on the Atlantic. We hop*
to piny a constantly growing part, in the
great ocean of the orient. We wish, as
we ought to wish, for a great commer
cial development in our dealings with
Asia and it is out of the question that
we should permanently have such de
velopment unless wo. freely and gladly
extend to other nations the same measurt
of justice and good treatment which we
expect to receive in return.
It is only a. very small body of oui
citizens that act badly.
I recommend to congress that an act
be passed specifically providing for the
naturalization of Japaneso who come her*
intending to become American citizens.
Cuba's Paragraph.
I take this opportunity of expressing
upon behalf of the American people, with
all possible solemnity, our most earnesf
hope that the people of Cuba will realize
the imperative need cf preserving juslici
and keeping order in the island. Th*
United States wishes nothing of Cuba ex
cept that It shall prosper morally and ma«
trially, and wishes nothing of the Cubans
save that they shall be able to preserve
order among themselves and therefore t«
preserve their independence. If the cleo
tions become a farce, and if the insurrec
tionary habit becomes confirmed in the
island, it is absolutely out of the question
that the island should continue Independ
ent and the United States, which has as
sumed the sponsorship before the civilized
world for Cuba's career ?.s a nation, would
again have to intervene and to sec thai
the government was managed in such or
derly fashion as to secure the safety ol
life and property.
War Imperative.
By the special and highly appreciated
courtesy of the government of Russia and
the Netherlands, a proposal to call The
Hague conference together at a tlmt
which would conflict with the conference
of the American republics at Rio de Jan
eiro in August was laid aside. No othei
date has yet been suggested. A tentative
program for the conference has been pro
posed by the government of Russ'a, and
the subjects which it enumerates are un
dergoing careful examination and consid
eration in preparation for the conference
It must ever be kept in mind that war
not merely justifiable, but imperative,
upon honorable men, upon an honorabk
nation, where peace can only be obtained
by the sacrifice of conscientious convic
tion or of national welfare.
Peace is normally a groat good, and nor
mally St coincides with righteousness but
it is righteousness and not peace which
should bind the conscience of a nation as
It should bind the conscience of an individ
ual and neither a nation nor an individual
can surrender conscience to another's
keeping. Neither can a nation, which Is
an entity, and which, does not die as in
dividuals die, refrain from taking thought
for the interest of the generations that
are to come, no less than for the
interests of the generation of to
day and no public men have a right,
whether from shortsightedness, from sel
flesh indifference, or from sentimentrlity,
to sacrifice national interests which are
vital in character. A just war is in tho
long run far better for a nation's --out
than the most prosperous peace obtained
by acquiescence in wrong or injustice.
Moreover, though It is criminal for a na
tion not to prepare for war, so that it may
escape the dreadful consequences of be
ing defeated in war. yet it must alwavs be
remembered that even to be defeated in
war, may be far better than not to have
fought at all. As has been well and finely
said, a beaten nation is not necessarily a
disgraced nation but the nation or man is
disgi-aced if the obligation to defend right
is shirked.
We should as a nation do everything in
our power for the cause of honorable
peace, it is morally as indefensible for a
nation to commit a wrong upon another
nation, strong or weak, as for an individ
ual thus to wrong his fellows. We should
do all iu our pewor'to hasten the day when
there shall be peace among the nations—
a pc-ace based upon jus-tke and not upon
cowardly submission to wrong.
The United States navy is the surest
guarantor of peace which this country
possesses, ft Is earnestly to be wished
that we would profit by the" teachings o£
history In this mater. A strong and wise
people will study its own failures no less
than its triumphs, for there is wisdom to
be learned from tho study of both, of the
mistake as well as of the success.
1 do not ask that we continue to increase
our
navy.
