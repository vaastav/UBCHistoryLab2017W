OIBCUSSED IN THE REICHSTAG.
Osafll«tts| Reports From the Chines*
Rebellion—Prince Bismarck Royally
Greeted by People of Hamburg.
BUM*, Dec. 10.— In the reichstag today
Chancellor von Caprivl opened the debate on
the new commercial treaties, making a strong
appeal for their adoption. He dwelt upon the
fact that the preeent import and export rela
tions would ruin both employers and employes.
The measures under discussion were necessary
to preserve Germany's husbandry sad com
merce.
Continuing, the chancellor said the immediate
effect of the treaties upon the finances of the
empire would be a diminution of the revenue
by nearly 13,000,000 marks. This was a matter
that required budget consideration.
tipeaking on the question of the differential
treatment of countries not included in the
treaties, he said it was needless to speak of
buasia. The lamentable distreaa in that coun
try would not be removed for aome time, and it
waa useless to discuss what would be done
afterward.
Aa regards the United States, the two govern
ments have decided to continue on the basis of
the arrangements of l&oi, whereby the United
Etates received the moat favored nation treat
ment.
In connection with the alleged distress is
Germany he said the agriculture of the country
could very well bear, without risk, a reduction
in the tariff rate of 1% mart*. In the matter of
Wine, it had been the aim to compel sharp com
petition against artificial wines, schnaos and
the so-called "French clarets,'' ao A* to pro Tide
on German «oil a better field for Italian wines
against those of France. The reduction of du
t.en on the necessaries of life was an advantage
to the working people.
Adverting to the McKinley law the chancellor
Mid:
IV e wish the countries of Europe to preserve
their independence against America. For mis
Imrpose they must unite together. The treaties
ust concluded will give a sure guarantee for
the future.
Herr Von Kanitz, Conservative, opposed the
chancellor's policy. Ho regretted that thfl ne
gotiations showed that they had only free trade
counselors. Ho looked forward to the ruin of
the German agriculturist.
The chancellor responded thnt he ha-i been
aided by the same advisers that assisted I'rlnce
Bismarck.
At a meeting of the Conservative members of
the reich«tng twelve voted in favor of and 254
against the treaties. Herr Kardoff read a tele
gram stating that Bismarck did not intend to
appear during the debate.
VIENNA, Dec. 10.— The new commercial
treaties between Austria, Hungary and Ger
many, and Austria-Hungary ana Switzerland

Bait Liken office, which was burned. One un
fortunate fell into the hands of the Insurgents,
who nailed him hands and feet to a board and
cut him up piecemeal. The victim was con
sidered s sacrifice to their flag. When the
insurgents, flushed with success, made
a complete circuit around the city,
they met with stubborn resistance from
a volunteer force about 1,000 strong,
which repulsed every attempt to take the walls
by assault For three days the city held out
and then provisions ran short Although agi
tated by fear and harrassed by hunger, the
defenders stood nobly to their post in the des
perate hope of an early rescue by the imperial
troops. The insurgents seized a fsvorable
moment to send a large force to storm
the defenders A bloody struggle ensued,
resulting In favor of the attacking party. Tho
leader was the first one to leap over the wall,
and, rushing straight to the magistrate's yamen,
he first liberated ail the prisoners. The author
ities have dispatched a thousand soldiers to the

bave left the city and are encamped on the hills.
LONDON, Dec. 10.—D.spatches from I'ekin

HONOLULU, 11. 1.. Nov. 25.—According to ac
counts published in lute Sydney pavers, liloora
and Douglass, owners ot the yacht Beagle, who
left this p> it very suspiciously a lew weeks airo,
were interested in the Australian Mercantile
and Guarantee Association, and defrauded the
association out of large sums of money, through
the assistance, it is alleged, of James Millar,
manager of the association. Bloom and Doug
lass' real name* are Bell and Davis. It is
claimed they hnvo succeeded in getting away
with 000 in coin, £'"'.ooo of which belonged to
Davis' mother. It became ku >wu s : tioe the
Be&cle left that about JJi.«>*) in wvee :ns were

This, it ts learned, he succeeded in doing, and
then left f r s.tn Francisco on the steamer Mar -

The same steamer cairied the wive* of Bell and

ister ot foreign aSsirs. s.a:d to an Associated
Press correspondent today that he is distinctly
ep;>»>sed to any attempt to draw Franco ar.d Rus
sia into alliance, lie ca:i discover no common
bond* of union between the most enlightened
people of E'.irop* and a country almost Fasten*
in its barbarity The prevalent idea in France
is that this alliance will enable her to reea.u
the !o»{ provinces, while she will help Russia
lay hands on Constantinople But while Rus
sia will cot fail to seire every opportunity of in
creasing her empire, »hc would not embroil her
self With Europe to please France, and when
satisfied would repudiate any cla ms the latter
power might hare on her. In his opinion the

would be one with England.
The President's Message Plrssss Italy.
London, IVo. 10.—The Chrofttde't correspon
dent at Rome asat r;s thai the United States c v
erument in Rome has given ihc lial.an c .v*rn
tnent a semi official promise to so modify the
American constitution as to insure more a: sa

I'm ted 6 laics, Premier Rudini said he Lad taken
octe ot th* friendly txjreaeiona in President
Harrison's message and felt confident the ques
tions at issue between the countries would soon
be settled.
English Comment on the Message.
LOWDOW, Dec. 10.— The St. Jama Gazette, com
menting today on President Harrison's mes
sage, says: The moat important point in the
document ia that part which has reference to
the result of the McKinley tariff. The figures
presented compare significantly with the Brit
ish figures, which remain stationary. The cal
culation of the aupportera of the McKinley bill
are working out much better than any on* in
England had reason to expect.
Ihe Globe sarcastically comments on the mes
sage which, it aaya, is adroitly traced on catch-
Tote lines. Nervous Yankees are assured that
the government knowa how to climb down as in
the cases of the Chile and Bering sea dispute.
Lord Salisbury need not be much frightened at
President Tlarrison'a tremendous menace and
the expression of concern at foreign encroach
ments upon territories controlled by the Ameri
can government. The Globe disputes the state
ment male in the message that the prosperity
of the United States Is entirely due to the Mc-
Kinley bill. On the contrary, it says the pros
perity of the country is due to the exceptional
harvest there at a time when Europe was short
of grain.
Newfoundland and Canada at War Again.
ST. JOHNS N. F.. Dec. 10.—In retaliation for the
duties imposed by Cauada on Newfoundland
fish, the government has put in for;>e that sec
tion of the act against ( anada which increases
the duties on articles imported from Canada.
II AM TAX, N. S., Dec. 10.— The war of tariff*
between Canada and Newfoundland has been
f' rma.ly inaugurated. The St. Johns, N. F.,
Ilcrald and Harbor Grace Standard strongly con
demn the action of the government in placing a
retaliatory law in force and declare it is most
suicidal. On the other hand, a telegram to the
organ of the government says:
The people of Newfoundland are pleased with
the a'-tion of the government in excluding in
termeddling and oiiieious Canada from tree ac
cess to our bait fisheries, and the wisdom of
this course will be emphasized in a very forci
ble manner before the close of next year's fish
ing season. Every fisherman in Newfoundland
knows that but fot 'h* -stand taken wgainst this
colony by Canada we should today have been
enjoying the desirable advantage of free tradu
with the States. Canada deserves no fa
vorable consideration at our hands, She has
been corrupt at home and treacherous to her
sister colonies, and the feeling ;n Newfound
land today is that the less we nave to do with
her tha better.
Florence St. John'a Divorcs Salt.
LONDON, Dec. 10.—The trial of the suit of Miss
F!< renre St. John agnlnst her husband was con
tinued today. Interest in the case shows no

mother and brother he and his wife would live
happily together.

Appropriations for United States Prisons
Overlooked The Proceedings
Against the Steamer Itata.
Washington Citt, Dec. 10.— The annual re
port of Attorney-General Miller was submitted
to congress today. It reviews the business of
the Uu.ted States supreme court, and devotes a
chapter to the circuit court of appals, which,
he says, has been organized in each circuit and
is rea :y for business, ahhough the additional
circuit judge in eacii circuit has not yet been
.appointed. Mention is made oJ the heavy in
crease in business in the court of claims, and
the recommendation is made that the worwing
force of the court be largely Increased. He says
it is also necessary thnt some provision be made
for representation of the interests of the govern
ment before trie board of appraisers in the cus
toms cases appealed from collectors to the board
of appraisers.
He Invites attention to the special report on
the subject oi Indian depredation claims, and
shows the importance of a change in the con
duct of tnat business. The claims aggregate
*i0,000,000.
On the subject of United States prisons, the
attorney general says:
In pursuance of the recommendations in the
annual report of this depigment, a bill wns
passed by the iast conere->sauthorizing the con
struction of tiiree United Statu* prisons, to be
located one nortn and the other south of the
thirty-ninth dev;reo of north latitude and cast
of trie liock es, and iho third west of the
Rockies, but bv evident inadvertence congress
failed to ir.afce any appropriations tor tho pur
chase of sucn sites and the erection of such
building*. I recommend th.it the appropria
tions evidently contemplated by that act be
made, so that the work may go forward.
After speaking of the well-known dlfficu Itie
in the enforcement of the Chiueso exclusion act,
ho says:
If it is desired that these law* should be made
effective thev should be so changed that they
cannot be misunderstood. To n rest ami try
Mich perioni), au lus a result simp. - ' s:nd them
bi?n across tna British line, is shown to !/C u"' 1 -
le-s expenditure of time, labor and money, by
the fact that, us mlgnt weti be expected, tho
mine person" have been arrested uud tiled over
ami ovf-r again. Moreover, it is quite uncer
tain whether the oider requiring Chinese pris
oners to be sent 1». e.k t« the Br:iish domains
could be made etl'ective. This subject demands
prompt cons! eration.
From information, official and unoffi I*l, with
record to 'lie nd:;;iu "- ration of tt e laws in
Alaska, the attorney general is impressed that
such administration is not satisfactory and that
It can only bo made satisfactory by new legisla
tion. The attorney general called attention to
the evils of the fee fvstsrn, and advises as a sub
stitute stipulated salaries in all cases.
lie reviews the legal proceedings in the ca«e
of the Chilean steamer itata, and sums up «■
follows:
Upon trial of this indictment it was held by
the district court: l-ir*t, tlir.t these proceed
ings were not in violation of neutral law* of
the United States, because the enterprise was a
leiritimata commercial transaction: so otid. be
cause the Cong essional party of Chile, not hav
ing at the time received rec< gniti n by the gov
ernment of the United States either as a govern
ment de jure or as a belligerent, and that the
acts were i!one by representatives of and in the
Interest of c party in the way of hostilities
against the i hiler.n government" and was not in
violation of the statutes of the United States; in
short, that It is only in the interest of a govern
ment recognized as such de jure, or as belliger
ent, that the neutrality ot the statutes of the
United States can be violated. Without discus-
Sing the proportion of such a transaction to
legitimate commerce, 1 venture tho suggestion
that in case of ssrious injury to commercial or
other interests of nations with which we are at
pence, by ships fitted out in our hsrbors, tho
plea of such non-recoenit.on is a very insuffi
cient answer, and if the construction given to
these statutes by the trial court shall be su«-
tained on appeal, the statutes should, I thiuk,
be amended. •
He reported five suits commenced under the
act of August 7, 18S8, requiring all telegraph
lines subsidized by the government, by and
through they* own respective corporation offi ers
and employes, to maintain and operate for rail
road, governmental, commercial and all other
purposes such telegraph lines, und requiring the
attorney general, by proper proceedings, to pre
vent any unlawful interference with the rights
and equities of the United states in relation to
such telegraph lines. On this subject the at
torney general says that in the suits of the
United States against the Central Pacific Rill
road Company and Western Union Telegraph
Company, and against the Southern Pacific Rail
road Company and Western Union Telegraph
Company, both pending in the northern district
of California, upon demurrers or motions to
dismiss for want of jurisdiction, it being
claimed on behalf of the Western Union
and other corporations that the part es
defendant having charters from other states
than California, they cannot be sued
in the United States circuit court or in
any district court other than that from which
they derive their respective charters. In other
words, they are not "inhabitants" of any dis
trict except the district in the state by which
they were created. Touching the question of
jurisdiction, raised by th-rse corporations, as
non-residents of California, he says:
The result of *uch contention is that a cor
poration like the Western I'nion Telegraph Com
pany, a Sew York corp >r* ion, whicn is doing
business ineverv state and dis.rictin the Uu ted
States, has the right to sue in federal courts in
the vurio'is di.trirt.. and i: sued in the state
courts they move that such suits for litigation
in federal courts cannot be sued in federal
courts in any state outside of New
York, ft is not believed that such is the law,
at least where the government is plaintiff. Cer
tainly it wis not the intention of congress in
enacting the judiciary law of to thus make
corporations a pivfleged c:»«. I recommend
that section 1 of the act of August, ls*B (25
Mat., p 4:: i), be amended by inserting the pro
viso initials after the word "inhabitant," in the
following sentence, namely:
"And no civil suit shall be brought before
either of-aid courts aga n-t a person by an in
dividual process or a proceeding in anV other
district than that whereof he is a habitant;"
prov.ded, that any to-eign corporation may be
sued in uny distr <n where it may be found that
process is to be served, us in t like case in a
state where said suitor act on is brought.
>-ueh an amendment would restore ihe law to
what it wa« for a ce >turr prior thereto nn-1 to
the act of M -r< h 3, IhoT, find would impose on
the*e corporation* the liability to I. • sued -orre
tp- ndin,.' to the right they enjoy to sue n*
pi in ill's and to remove suits in which they ure»
defendants.
THE WORLD'S FAIII.
Meeting of State Representatives—Effort
to Close on tVorkmsn's Holiday.
Chicago. Dec. 10.— The representatives of the
World's fair boards of the various states and
territories spent the morning today listening to
reports on the progress of the w.>rk. In the
afternoon a visit was paid to tae World's fair
grounds.
A novel proposition was put forth at todav's
session, the originstor being Vice-president De
Young, of the national commission. He wishes
congress to pus a law authorizing thp coinage
of something which will be at the same time
legal tender and a souvenir of the Columbian
exposition. Jle offered a resolution that the
government be requested to coin in the m.nt
specie of the value of .V) cents, this being the
probable price of admission to the fair,
so that these coins couid be used
for that purpose and made valuable
souvenirs, their component psrts to be
gold and silver tn ratio; that 5,000,000 be struck
off. and thet they be legal tender; that the sec
retary of this meeting be requested to forward
the resolution to Congressman springer with a
request that ho Introduce such a bill. "No*, I
don't want you to jump into th.s m»;ter without
rt ie consideration of it." sai l Mr. De Young,
"so I trove that it be laid over for discussion
until ti:e next session." It is almost a fore
gone conclusion that the rational board of
control will refuse to concur with the local
finance committee in the plan to ask congress
for an appropriation instead of a loan.
Harp.i- bc.: «, Pa.. Dec. 10.—At a meeting of
the World's fair managers of Pennsylvania this

Chicago, Dec. 9. -Thirty-one state Worlds
fair organizations were represented in a con
vention called to meet today with the board of
control, department chie s and directors of t. e
expo-ition. luily 100 people were present,
about fca»f of them being women delegates
from the states. Messrs. De Youag, M tts-y , St.
< .air, Llndsey and M artindale represented
the national board of controL The proceed
ings had not gone lar before President
Baker, of the local directory, maia a speech that
seemingly complicate* the relation! between the
state board and the national commissioner*, and
may lead to lively times in the convention, Mr
l>e Young introduced a resolution, which was
adopted, providing for reports from each state
on the work accomplished and information dc
sired. At this point Baker was called on to
•peak, and lu the course of h;s remark* said:
The object of this convention is to secure the
co-operation <>f stato boards in dea.ing with the
exhibitors. To do this effectually the state or
ganization* must secure authority from the
board of control. It is difficult to deal with ex
hibitors from the states thr>ugh the depart
ment* of the fair. J'here must be discrimina
tion in the selection of exhibits, and depart
ment chiefs cannot iu-ige of the display
in a distant state or discriminate between ex
hibitors because thev have no means oI Judg
ing. A remedv for thi* would lie in the regula
tions directing all applications for space irom
the states to com J through the»tat<» board aud
vestiug state authorities with power oi dis
crimination as to exhibits.
The national commission and the board of
control have hereiolore had control of appliea
tions tor space and the installation of exhibits.
Baker's speech apparently conveyed to the dele
pates the impression that they would not oe
given power in their respective Jurisdictions to
say who oh >Uld cxh:b t and who not
Delegate Graves, of Wisconsin, at ones offered
a resolution in that vein. It was laid over till
tomorrow ond from indications it will cause a
lively discus-ion.
Ex-Cong less man Frank, of Missouri, offered a
resolution providing for the or.-ranisatiou oi all
atato deiegationa present into one body, bomo
of the member* of the board of control thought
they *aw in this a move to demand permission
to install the exhibits In the state btyidinxs,
and the resolution was postpoue i until tomor
row.
Tne convention then adjourned. At a subse
quent me rtlng or the board of control the mat
ter was considered anil one of the members said
afterward that while they wauted the co-opera
tion of state organizations and were incli.ie 1 to
confer gome power on t'icm. they would not
consent to any such broad division of control.
NEW YORK, Dec. 9.—The New York Boiri of
Trade und Transportation t >dsy re<olved that
the state ought to spend at least 11.000,000 in
representing its interests at tho Chicago fair.
SURVEY FOB HAWAIIAN CABLE.
It Will lie Over Two .Miles Down, and
Slay l and on Monterey Kay.
IIowoLVLr, Nov. iV—The Cnited .-tetrs steamer
Albatross arrived here on the 2lst inst., and is
expected to remain in port about two wee*«,
when she makes n second survey on her return
trip to San Kran<isco. Lieutenant Tanner states
that a preliminary surrey of B"><j tniies of the
coast of California has bejn made with a view
to finding the best starting point for the cable.
In his opinion Salinas Landing, in the b*y of
Monterey, will be the most suitable. Ho further
states that there is no reason in his opinion
th« cable could not be laid. There would be
several difficulties to overcome, but only such
as are usual in laying deep sea cables. The
greatest depth reached was 3.100 fathoms, the
average depth being about 2,">00 fa:homs. About
210 soundings hail been taken on the way to the
islands, the last one being off Piamon t Henri,
where a depth of "oO fathoms wm found. The
Albatross t ok a great circle in her course com
ing down, and on returning will make survey
en a straight course. Ihe landing place for the
cable on this island has not yet teen determined.

thirteen days out. The vessel is run by the
Canadian Pacific, aud will continue to st- p at
this port in future on her trips to and from the
Orient The Jaf.au Gazette says late news men
tions the arrival at Ojaki of two directors from
Nagoyta and a few members of the Ked Cross
Society, which has proved a great reliei to the
wounded. The number of amputations of
limbs appear to have been large, and it is said
that as the limbs are being preserved in alcohol
for future dissection, numerous bottles contain
ing them may bj seen in the hospitals. The
people are still camping in the open air, fearing
further shocks, and are destitute of warm cloth
ing. Although the weather has, fortunately, on
the whoie been mild and tine, a heavy raiufall
occurred, adding materially to the discomfort
of the people. They have rigged up rough boxes
like sheds and shelters of wood and matting,
and are huddled together in the streets. Ogaki
being especially liable to inundation, the people
are keeping boats close at hand, to be prepared
for the worst.
Camparatively few of the dead are being
Claimed by friends, as many bo lies are unrec
ognizable, aud in other c.-ises whole families
died together. Those crushed by falling timbers
were terribly mangled, an 1 some have not yet
been found. Interment h<s b„eu but indiffer
ently conducted, asonu account makes mention
of limbs and br dies tie ng heaped together, and
that the debris is becoming very offensive from

very serious gr nind for tearing that disease

The Indemnity Claims Against Chile.
VALPARAISO, Deo. 10.—[Now York IT?ra'd Spe
cial.]—Senor Matte in m statement relative to the
claims made by foreigner#, Nays that the govern
ment is bound in duty to administer «trict jus
tice. The Chilean ministry, however, he add*,
regrets that all attempt! have failed to formu
late claims which at times have
been allowed in America, owing to
the special circumstances under which the
government against whom such claim* were
preferred was placed toward those in whose
favor they were formulated. To countenance
the present attempts would be to create in favor
of the foreigners privileges that are allowed
neither by state nor international law, by vir
tue of the mere fact that a foreigner takes up
his residence in Chile to show that he likes it
and that if it suits him he would further wish
to acquire right to impose on the government
an obligation to secure hirn against rainfall nnd
disastrous events that afliict Chileans as well as
foreigners, and which are entirely duo to
a superior force, as in the case of
August 28 aod 29. While there is no doubt
that the claims of prominent Biitish
merchants are in several ens.-s gr >ssly exag
gerated, still :n the end the Chilean government
cannot refuse to pay a large portion of the
claims made for the sacking and looting in Val
paraiso, Vlua del Mar and Santiago, as well »a
for damages t > the nitrate railroad and deten
tion of steamers.
