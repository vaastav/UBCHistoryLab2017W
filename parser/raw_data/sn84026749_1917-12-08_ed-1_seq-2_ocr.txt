the town. Somehow I dldnt. Sly nrit
-thought was that the citadel had
blown up.
"I don't make any bonee about say
ing that I beat It. I ran out Into tne
.street. It was filled with people cry
"lng, praying, but all running. Some
body said: Run south, because the
explosion was to the north of us.
"Believe me I ran south, but I was
Hot alone. The windows were broken
out and the street filled with debris.
Windows of Jewelry stores were
broken out and diamonds and watches
lay open in Vie cases, but nobody paid
any attention to them. I guess ev
erybody thought the same thing I
did, to get to an open place as soon
as possible.
Heard Cries et Weunded.
"It was fearful. Lire wires were
down all over the street and In the
buildings that were shattered we
could hear the wounded crying.
"Trying to help at that time was
worse than useless. It was too big.
It was stunning. We didn't co-ordinate,
all we thought of was to get
somewhere away from the horror,
"I turned into a parade ground
some blocks from my office to get
ny breath a little and then ran up
on top of the hill. This cnust have
been ten minutes after the explosion,
but a big mushroom of smoke which
was bursting pure white at the top
towered up into the sky over the
harbor. It was terrifying, but still
one of the most magnificent things
X ever remember seeing.
"From the top of the hill I soon
faw that practically all the destruc
)tlon was on the north of us. In the
poorer wooden section of the city.
Weodea Uetues Wrecked.
"The force of the explosion had
Demolished the flimsy wooden build
ings and the overturned stoves had
aet them on fire. I did not hear at
any time the slightest suspicion of a
German plot. An officer In the citadel
told me that the Mont Blanc bed
610 tons of T. N. T. on boardbut that
only forty Jons of It exploded. I do
not know how he knew. I think he
was probably mistaken. At the time
We stood on the hill orders had come
to be ready to flood the naval maga
clnes In the harbor.
"Stranttlv enonrti then was tin scram

was scheduled to leave at 6 p. m., and
finally got away at 1130. and I came

there is a whole window in the ctly

"With the blizzard which has start

must be suffering terribly with cold
and exposure, besides from their
hurts and burns."
Asked how many dead he thought
there were in the city, Mr. Arbuckle
said he believed there were at least
(,000, and possibly as many Injured.

HALIFAX, N. S-, Dec 1 A lashing
northeaster burdened with sleet., that
howled in from the Atlantic all last
night, and was still raging early today,
faTed to bait relief work in this stricken
city.
Twenty thousand destitute men. wo
men, and children were sheltered In
buildings and homes which still remain
standing. Barriers of tar paper were
built in the shattered windows to shut
out the bitter gale.
The loss In Halifax falls heaviest upon
children. Whole schools. Oiled with
pupils, were demolished, leaving but one
or two survivors. Hundreds of children
have been blinded, many permanently.
by flying glass.
Two thousand dead. 5.000 injured.
20.000 homeless was the toll In Halifax
and Its suburbs when the French muni
tions ship Mont Blanc blew up In the
harbor Thursday, according to citizens
committee estimates today. The dam
age IS 300,000,000.
Eitnr Net Biassed.
Authorities, while too busy In car-
I lng for the more fortunate victims to
discuss other questions, refuse to be
lieve that an enemy hand had aught
to do with the collision and fire.
The thorough checking up work of
the citizens' committee resulted in
every destltue person in Halifax be
ing taken care of last night, when it
was certain death to wander through
the storm-swept streets without
proper clothing.
Many of the refugees are going
about wrapped In blankets. Their own
clothes are torn to shreds.
BUsxard Brings Menace.
The wildest weather the Atlantic
coast can produce has practically end
ed the hunt for bodies. A thick pall
of snow covers the blackened ruins
of the north end. The sleet helped the
exhausted firemen once again to sub
due the flres In the wreckage.
The many thousand homeless vic
tims of the horrible disaster face
added terrors today, pneumonia and
famine.
The blizzard, abating somewhat to
day, is directly responsible for the
deaths of many who were alive but
who had rot been rescued from the
mass of wreckage.
The blizzard may prove a double
menace. Adding to the suffering to
the probable extent of pneumonia. It
may also seriously Interfere with
railroad traffic. In that event, the
relief trains would be held .back, and
hunger would necessarily follow.
1.700 Bedles necevered.
Official statements Issued today by
heads of the relief committee show
that 1.700 bodies have been remoted
from the mass of debris.
When those who found places to
sleep or shudder throughout the
long, cold night, emerged today, the
scene which greeted them was even
more appalling! Many bodies which
had been spared by the flames had
been frozen.
The blizzard had completed the
work which the fire had left unfin
ished. It had done more. It had
penetrated every house left stand
ing in Halifax, had added exposure
and cold to shock and injuries, and
had paved the way for countless cases
of pneumonia.
Xo Wladew Panes Left.
The fight against the elements was
more uneven than the fight against
the fire There Is not a window pane
left In Halifax, Dartmouth, or Rich
mond. Many doors were twisted from
their hinges and many houses were so
twisted that the doors do not fit.
Improvised shutters, pillows, old
clothes and boards failed to keep out
the biting gale. Added to this suffer
ing was the fact that the victims,
for the greater part, were compelled
to remain in darkness throughout the
night.
Those who possessed lamps or lan
terns could not keep them lit. so
strong was the gale which harrassed
the stricken city throughout the long
night.
Kven rescue parties are compelled
to cease work occasionally and seek
places of warmth.
One Itellef Train Arrives.
But one of the many relief trains
said to be headed for Halifax has ar
rived. That is the first train leaving
Boston.
Tor the first time since Halifax
tottered and fall Ilka a house of
blocks, the devastated area may now
be defined. The destruction extends
from North street, near the center of
the city, for a distance of more than
twd miles up the harbor to Xfrlcville
on the Bedford Basin. Also-for-a djj.

he cannot expect assistance from
other physicians.
From out of the chaos there comes
at least one bit of cheering news.
A careful search has failed to rind

SENATOR VARDAMAN. Mfely. postponed until after the
war is over. The fevered brai nis a veritable "Pandora's box" of mis
takes, and an error is often more perplexing and productive of harm
than a deliberate crime. There is no function in the social
life of Americans more potential of good or evil than that of the editor
of a great newspaper or magazine. Its jnfluence extends throughout
the land and its consequences are felt even by generations yet unborn.
"Mr. President, in wading through the enormous mass of common
place editorial stuff which fills the metropolitan newspapers nowadays
one becomes tired with the pernicious monotony. Most of these editors
write what they are told to write and support the policies agreed upon
by the patriots for pelf. To run upon something really virile, vigor
ous, healthy in morals and sound in economics, such as the editorial
which appeared on the first page of The Washington Times of the
afternoon of yesterday, is refreshing. I am going to ask permission
to insert this editorial in the Record. It is worthy of a p'aee there. I
wish every patriotic American could read it. Its patriotism is refresh
ing, and the salutary lesson which it teaches ought to bear good fruit.
I especially commend it to the Committee on Interstate Commerce, to
which I shall ask that it be referred. I ask that it be inserted in the
Record, without reading, unless some Senator desires to have it read."
There being no objection, the editorial from The Washington
Times of December 6 referred to was referred to the Committee on
Interstate Commerce and ordered to be printed in the Record.
EUROPEAN WAR
NEWS SUMMARY
The battle on the Asiago plateau positions, west of the Brenta
river, in northern Italy, panses momentarily as the forces of General
Diaz have withdrawn to the second defense line of heights in this area.
The Austro-Germsns, again seeking to pierce and then turn the Italian
line with hose forces, have apparently once more failed in their chief
object. The Italian second line is reported to be held intact and is de
clared to be stronger than the first
The Teutonic troops directed their chief attacks against the Ital
ian defenses on Slonte Sisamol and Monte Meletta. south of Gallio.
But it was in the latter sector that the piercing movement was at
tempted.. Terrific artillery bombardment preceded this operation, but
the bravery of a single brigade of Bersaglieri, the Fourth, saved the
day. They held out for twelve hours and made it possible for the Ital
ians to link up their second line at all points in this vicinity. The
Austro-Germans made six desperate attacks and were finally compelled
to desist because of very heaty losses. to ue expeciea, no ever,
that the Invaders will renew their offensive.
On the western front there are Indications that the Germans con
template an attack In the Arras region, north of tho River Scarpe,
south of Lens. The latest British official report at hand mentions in
creased artillery activity of great intensity In this region, which Is
north of the Cambral area. It Is not Improbable that the Germans will
attempt to push forward along the Scarpe In order to weaken the hold
of the British to the southward, at Hullecourt, above Queant-
In the Cambral sector relatively little fighting of more than local
Importance has occurred In the past thirty-six hours, and most of this
has been initiated by the British. They attacked on the eascrn side of
the salient, and in tho Wdnlty of La Vacquerle. German trench posl
tlons were captured and the British line materially improved thereby.
On the French front the artllery activity remarked for the past
four days contnues In tho Champagne and on the Verdun front; in the
former sector near Malsons de Champagne, and In the latter, east of
tho Meuse. No infantry actions have occurred.
The French official report states that the iirtillery aclhlty has
also Increased greatly in the region of the Khine-Rhone canal. It will
be recalled that this Is tho section of the French line where United
States troops have been In front line trenches for training purposes,
and it is not Improbable that the Germans intend one of their "object
lessons" In an attack In some force.
It is now announced officially that tfce Roumanian forces have un
dertaken armistice negotiations with the Austro-derman command,
following such action by the Russian commarder on the Roumanian
front. Since the upheaval that floated the Maximalists to the top in
Russia, Roumanian armed forces h" bee" isolated and there was
practically nothing else for them to do than to fo low Russia's lead.

powers, but sought asylum in some neu
tral country.
But the very speculation Indulged
by officials illustrates how compu
cated and uncertain Is the whole Rue
slan situation. In the face of such
circumstances the formulation of a
policy is hazardous. Tet President
Wilson apparently has determined to
follow the same course that he aid
In Mexico to omit no opportunity to
express the sympathy of the United
States with the revolution as sn ab
stract thing, and to refrain from
showing excessive friendliness to or
partisanship for any faction until as
sured that the latter is truly repre
sentative of the revolution and pos
sesses the elements of sovereignty
popular support and sanction.
Great Britain and France have not
been ready to go as for as the United
States. v "t n'llson's posl-
on In the councils of the allies Is
such tit., i point of view
eventually will be accepted.
Press dispatches from Paris har
repeatedly hinted that Colonel House
was endeavoring to get the entente
to adopt a more sympathetic attitude
toward the Russian revolution, how
ever disappointing may be Its present
military aspect. The President's
message to Congress reveals his pur
pose not to relax the moral support
of this country to the revolution as a
whole, though material aid may be
for the time being withheld until a
government of unquestionably repre
sentatlve of the people Is established.
Senator Sterling of South Dakota,
who has long taken a keen interest
In the affairs of the District, today
declared for the Polndexter delegate
bill.
"I am in favor of the Polndexter
bill which would give the District
a delegate In Congress," said the Sen
ator.
"I bellev the District should be rep
resented by a delegate chosen by the
people who would have the right to
speak on District affairs and vote
on them."
Senator Sterling said he was not
yet ready to support the proposition
of complete self-government for the
District but he was clearly In favor
of a delegate and would so vote and
speak In the Senate.
