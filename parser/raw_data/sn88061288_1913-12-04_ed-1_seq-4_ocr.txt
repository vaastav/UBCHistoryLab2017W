Washington, D. C The annual ad
dress of President 'Wilson, delivered
at a joint session of. the two houses
of Congress at the beginning of the
second session of the Sixty-third Con
gress, was as follows:
Address of the President.
Gentlemen of the Congress:
In pursuance of my constitutional
duty to "give to the Congress informa
tion of the state of the Union," I
take the liberty of addressing you on
several matters which ought, as it
seems to me, particularly to engage
the attention of your honorable bodies,
as of all who study the welfare and
progress of the Nation.
I shall ask your indulgence if I
venture to depart in some degree from
the usual custom of setting before
you in formal review the many mat
ters which have engaged the atten
tion and called for the action of the
several departments of the Govern
ment or which look to them for early
treatment in the future, because the
list is long, very long, and would sut
ler In the abbreviation to which I
should have to subject it. I shall sub
mit to you the reports of the heads of
the several departments, in which
these subjects are set forth in care
ful detail, and beg that they may re
ceive the thoughtful attention of your
committees and of all Members of
the Congress who may have the leisure
to study them. Their obvious import
ance, as constituting the very sub
stance of the business of the Govern
ment, makes comment and emphasis
on my cart unnecessary.

about us of a growing cordiality ana
sense of community cf interest among
the nations, foreshadowing an age
of settled peace and good will. More
end more readily each decade do the
nations manifest their willingness to
bind themselves by solemn treaty to
the processes of peace, the processes
of frankness and fair concession. So
far the United States has stood at the
front of such negotiations. She will,
I earnestly hope and confidently be
lieve, give fresh proof of her sincere
adherence to the cause of international
friendship by ratifying the several
treaties of arbitration awaiting re
newal by the Senate. In addition to
these, it has been the privilege of
the Department of State to gain the
tassent, in principle, of no less than 31
nations, representing four-fifths of the
population of the world, to the ne
gotiation of treaties by which it shall
be agreed that whenever differences
of interest or of policy arise which
can not be resolved by the ordinary
processes of diplomacy they shall be
publicly analyzed, discussed, and re
ported upon by a tribunal chosen by
the parties before either nation de
termines its course of action.
There is only one possible standard
by which to determine controversies
between the United States and other
nations, and that is compounded of
these two elements: Our own honor
and our obligations to the peace of
the world. A test so compounded
ought easily to be made to govern both
the establishment of new treaty ob
ligations and the interpretation .of
those already assumed.
There is but one cloud upon our
horizon. That has shown itself to
the south of us, and hangs over Mex
ico. There can be no certain pros
pect of peace in America until Gen.
Huerta has surrendered his usurped
authority in Mexico; until it is un
derstood on all hands, Indeed, that
such pretended governments will not
be countenanced or dealt with by the
Government of the United States. We
are the friends of constitutional gov
ernment in America; we are more
than its friends, we are its champions;
because in no other way can our
neighbors, tc whom we would wish
In every way to make proof of our
friendship, work out their own de

ico has no Government. The attempt
to maintain one at the City of Mexico
has broken down, and a mere military
despotism has been set up which naa

hardly more than the semblance of na
tional authority. It originated in the
usurpation of Vlctorlano Huerta, who,
after a brief attempt to play the part
of constitutional President, has at
last cast aside even the pretense of
legal right and declared himself dic
tator. As a consequence, a condition
of affairs now exists in Mexico which
has made it doubtful whether even
the most elementary and fundamental
rights either of her own people or
of the citizens of other countries resi
dent within her territory can long be
successfully safeguarded, and which
threatens, if Ion continued, to im-
neril the interests of peace, order, and
tolerable life in the lands immediately
to the south cf us. Even if the
usurner had succeeded in his pur
poses, in despite of the constitution of
the ReDubllc and the rights of its
people, he would have set up noth
ing but a precarious and hateful
power, which could have lasted but
a little while, and whose eventual
downfall would have left the country
in a more deplorable condition than
ever. But he has not succeeded. He
has forfeited the respect and the
moral support even of those who were
at one time willing to see him suc
ceed. Little by little he has been
completely isolated. By a little every
day his power and prestige are
crumbling and the collapse is not
fur away. We shall not, I believe, be
obliged to alter our policy of watch
ful waiting. And then, when the end
comes, we shall hope, to see constitu
tional order restored in distressed
Mexico by the concert and energy of
such of her leaders as prefer the
liberty of their people to their own
embitions.
I turn to matters of domestic con
cern. You already have under con
sideration a bill for the reform of
our Rvstem of banking and currency.

need not say how earnestly I bofl'
for its early enactment into law. I
take leave to beg that the whole
energy and attention of the Senate be
concentrated upon it till the matter
is successfully disposed of. And yet
I feel that the request is not needed
that the Members of that great
House need no urging in this service
to the country.
I present to you, in addition, the
urgent necessity that special provision
be made also for facilitating the
credits needed by the farmers of the
country. The pending currency bill
does the farmers a great service. It
puts them upon an equal footing with
other business men and masters of
enterprise, as it should; and upon its
passage they will find themselves quit
of many of the difficulties which now
hamper them in the field of credit.
The farmers, of course, ask and
should be given no special privilege,
such as extending to them the credit
of the Government itself. What they
need and should obtain is legislation
which will make their own abundant
and substantial credit resources
available as a foundation for joint,
concerted local action in their own
behalf in getting the capital they
must use. It is to this we should now
address ourselves.
It has, singularly enough, come to
pass that we have allowed the indus
try of our farms to lag behind the
other activities of the country in its
development. I need not stop to tell
you how fundamental to the life of
the Nation is the production of its
food. Our thoughts may ordinarily be
concentrated upon 'the cities and the
hives of industry, upon the cries ot
the crowded market place and the
clangor of the factory, but it Is from
the quiet interspaces of the open val
leys and the free hillsides that we
draw the sources of life and of pros
perity, from the farm and the ranch,
from the forest and the mine. With
out these every street would be silent,
every office deserted, every factory
fallen into disrepair. And yet the far
mer does not stand upon the sme
footing with the forester and the
miner In the market of credit. He is
the servant of the seasons. Nature
determines how long he must wait for
his crops, and will not be hurried in
her processes. He may give his note,
but the season of its maturity de
pends upon the season when his crop
matures, lies at tne gates or me mr

where we now begin to see our way
very clearly and where many Intel
ligent plans are already being put
into execution. The Treasury of the
United States has, by a timely and
well-coniidered distribution of its de
nosits. facilitated the moving of the
crops in the present season and pre
vented the scarcity of available funds
too often experienced at such times.
But we must not allow ourselves to
depend upon extraordinary expedi
ents. We must add the means by
which the farmer may make his credit
constantly and easily available and
command when he will the capital by
which to support and expand his busi
ness. We lae behind many other
great countries of the modern world
In attempting to do this. Systems of
rural credit have been studied and
developed on the other side of the
water while we left our farmers to
shift for themselves in the ordinary
money market. You have but to look
about you in any rural district to see
the result, the handicap and embar
rassment which have been put upon
those who produce our food.
Conscious of this backwardness
and neglect on our part, the Con
gress recently authorized the crea
tion of a special commission to
study the various systems of rural
credit which have been put into op
eration in Europe, and this commis
sion is already prepared to report.
Its renort oueht to make it easier i
for us to determine what methods
will be best suited to our own farm
ers. I hope and believe that the
committees of the Senate and House
will address themselves to this mat
ter with the most fruitful results,
and I believe that the studies and
recently formed plans of the Depart
ment of Agriculture may be made
to serve them very greatly in their
work of framing appropriate and
adequate legislation. It would be
indiscreet and presumptuous in an'y
one to dogmatize upon so great and
many-sided a question, but I 'feel
confident that common counsel will

be easily agreed that we shiuid let
the Sherman antitrust law!, stand,
unaltered, as It is with its debatable
ground about it, but that we jshould
as much as possible reduce' the area
of that debatable ground by further
and more explicit legislation) and
should also supplement that' great
act by legislation which will not only
clarify it but also facilitate its ad
ministration and make it fairer to
all concerned. No doubt we shall
all wish, and the country will expect,
this to be the central subject of our
deliberations during the present
session; but It is a subject so many
sided and so deserving of careful
and discriminating discussion that I
shall take the liberty of addressing
you upon it in a special message at
a later date than this. It is of capi
tal importance that the business
men of this country should be re
lieved of all uncertainties of law
with regard to their enterprises and
investments and a clear path indi
cated which they, can travel without
anxiety. It is 'as important that
they should be relieved of embar
rassment and set free to prosper as
that private monoply should be de
stroyed. The ways of action should
be thrown wide open.
I turn to a subject which I hope
can be handled promptly and with
out serious controversy of any kind.
I mean the method of Selecting nom
inees for the Presidency of the
United States. I feel confident that
I do not misinterpret the wishes or
the expectations of the country when
I urjre the prompt enactment of leg
isla'.ion which will provide for pri
mary elections throughout the coun
try at which the voters of the several
parties may choose their nominees
for the Presidency without the in
tervention of nominating conven
tions. I venture the suggestion that
this legislation should provide for
the retention of party conventions,
but only for the purpose of declar
ing and accepting the verdicfof the
primaries and formulating the plat
forms of the parties; and I suggest
that these conventions should con

thf jjie of that independence as
eti- ftiv na the wav can be cleared
andthe foundations thoughtfully
antf permanently laid.
feting under the authority con
ferred upon the President by Con
gress, I have already accorded the
people cf the islands a majority in
both houses of their legislative body
by. appointing five instead of four
native citizens to the membership of
the commission. I believe that in
this way we shall make proof of
their capacity in counsel and their
sense of responsibility in the exer
cise of political power, and that the
success of this step will be sure to
clear our view for the steps which
are to follow. Step by step we
should extend and" perfect the sys
tem of self-government -in the isl
ands, making test of them and modi
fying them as experience discloses
their successes and their failures;
that we should more and more put
under the control of the native citi
zens of the archipelago the essential
instruments of their life, their local
instrumentalities of government,
their schools, all the common inter
ests of their communities, and so
by counsel and experience set up a
government which all the world will
see to be suitable to a people whose
affairs are under their own control.
At last, I hope and believe, we are
beginning to gain the confidence of
the Filipino peoples. By their coun
sel and experience, rather than by
our own, we shall learn how best to
serve them and how soon it will be
possible and wise to withdraw our
supervision. Let us once find the
path and set out with firm and con
fident tread upon it and we shall
not wander from it or linger upon it.
A duty faces us with regard to
Alaska which seems to be very press
ing and very imperative; perhaps I
should say a" double duty, fcr it con
cerns both the political and the ma
terial development of the Territory.
The people of Alaska should be given
the full Territorial form cf govern
ment, and Alaska, as a storehouse,
should be unlocked. One key to it is a
system of railways. These the Gov
ernment should itself build and ad
minister, and the ports and terminals
it should itself control in the interest
of all who wish to use them for the
service and development cf the coun
try and its people.
But the construction of railways is
only the first step; is only thrusting
in the key to the storehouse and
throwing back the lock and opening
the doer. How the tempting resources
of the country are to be exploited is
another matter, to which I shall, take
the liberty cf from time to time call
ing your attention, for it is a policy
which must be worked out by well
censidered Btages, not upon theory,
but upon lines of practical expediency.
It is part of our general problem of
conservation. We have a freer hand in
working out the problem in Alaska than
in the States of the Union; and yet
the principle and object are the same,
wherever we touch it. We must use
the resources of the country, not lock
them up. There need be no conflict
or Jealousy as between State and Fed
eral authorities, for there can be no
essential differences of purpose be
tween them. The resources in ques
tion must be used, but not destroyed
or wasted; used, but not monopolized
upon any narrow idea of Individual

States concerned than to the people
and Government, of the Nation at

are. We must tend our counsels to
this end. A common purpose ought to
make agreement easy.
Three cr four matters cf special
Importance and significance I beg
that you will permit me to mention in
closing.
Our Bureau cf Mines ought to be
equipped and empowered to render
even more effectual service than it
renders now in improving the condi
tions of mine labor and making the
mines more economically productive
as well as more safe. This is an all
Important part of the work ot con
servation; and the conservation of
human life and energy lies even near
er to our interest than the preserva
tion from waste of our material re
sources. We owe It, In mere Justice to the
railway employes of the country, to
provide for them a fair and effective
employers liability act; and a law
that we can stand by in this matter
will be no less to the advantage of
those who administer the railroads ot
the country than to the advantage of
those whom they employ. The expe
rience of a large number of the States
abundantly proves that.
We ought to devote ourselves to
meeting pressing demands of plain
Justice like this as earnestly as to
the accomplishment of political and
economic reforms. Social justice
comes first. Law is the machinery for
Its realization and is vital only as it
expresses and embodies it.
An international congress for the
discussion of all questions that affect
safety at sea is now sitting in Lon
don at the suggestion of our own
Government. So soon as the conclu
sions of that congres-a can be learned
and considered we ought to address
ourselves, among other things, to the
prompt alleviation of the very unsafe,
unjust, and burdensome conditions
which now surround the employment
of sailors and render it extremely dif
ficult to obtain the services of spirited
and competent men such as every
ship needs if it is to be safely handled
and brought to port.
May I not express the very real
pleasure I have experienced in co-op-crating
with this Congress and shar
ing with it the labors of common
service to which it has devoted it
self so unreservedly during the past
seven months of uncomplaining con
centration upon the business of legis
lation? Surely it is a proper and
pertinent part of my report on "the
state of the Union" to express my ad
miration for the diligence, the good
temper, and the full comprehension of
public duty -which has already been
manifested by both' the Houses; and
I hope that it may not be deemed an
hnpertient intrusion of myself into the
picture if I say with how -much and
how constant satisfaction I have
availed myself of the privilege of put
ting my time and energy at their dis
posal alike in counsel and in action.
HIS SYMPATHIES WITH ELK
8omewhat Natural, Since Animal Res
cued Engineer From Extremely
Awkward Position.
A curlcus story of adventure comes
from Montana. While a freight train
was lying over at a small mountain
station, the engineer borrowed a shot
gun and started out for a short hunt.
Finding nothing, he was returning to
the train when a cow came running at
him, and before he realized his dan
ger, she tossed him in the air.
Getting to his feet as quickly as
possible, he dodged behind a tree,
and then, to his dismay, found that
the gun barrel was bent so as to be
useless. The next ten minutes were
very lively ones, while the cow chased
the engineer round and round the
tree. Just when he was about to suc
cumb from fatigue, an angry snort was
heard, and a big elk appeared upon
the scene, head down and prepared
for a fight.
So was the cow, and In another mo
ment the two animals dashed at each
other. The engineer watched the com
baC for a few minutes, until prudence
suggested that he should make a re
treat as soon as he could. He re
gained the train In safety, and never
know the outcome of the battle, but
he hopes the elk was the victor.
Land In Bolivia.
In Bolivia all vacant land belongs

by purchase or lease, subject to spe

an International conference to secure
a reduction of naval construction, the
addition of two dreadnaughts, eight
destroyers and three submarines for
the navy during the coming year, gov

better educational facilities for en

ment law are chief recommendations
in the first annual report of Secretary
Daniels, made public.
The secretary departs from the
usual custom in addressing the pres
ident in the first person singular,
thereby adding to the directness and
force of the report's statements. The
report reflects his enthusiasm over
the navy, declaring that the story of
the year's work "by this patriotic
body of efficient defendu-s of the re
public is replete with examples of
courage, devotion, sacrifice and prog
ress." The secretary says the navy was
never In such a high state of efficien
cy as today, and that in considering
its future needs he has given less
thought to the guns than to the men
behind the guns. Believing that the
efficiency of the navy as a fighting
force will be in the highest sense pro
moted by the adoption of a serious,
and systematic course of instruction
aboard ship and at shore stations, he
points out that the department is try
ing to make the navy a great universi
ty. Not only ordinary seamen, but
even petty officers have too little ac
curate knowledge and this w ill be cor
rected by a systematic course of in
struction. Midshipmen of the graduat
ing classes wilKbe utilized as instruc
tors "with mutual benefit to the men
and themselves," and to fit them for
this work a short normal course will
be added to the naval academy curric
ulum. As the war college is the apex
of the navy system of education the
department will try to have all offi
cers pass through this training, using
mail courses where advisable.
WOMEN CAMPAIGN FOR VOTES
They Will Urge Congress to. Adopt
Constitutional Amendment.
Washington. -A week's campaign by
the National American Woman Suf
frage Association to secure the adop
tion of a constitutional amendment to
enfranchise women was launched at
a mass meeting in Washington. It
was the formal opening of the forty- .
fifth annual convention of the associ
ation. An assemblage, which packed
the edifice from footlights to. gallery,
listened for nearly three hours to dis
cussions on various phases of the suf
frage cause by conspicuous advocates
of the woman movement.. Suspended r
above the drop curtain was a huge yely-f
low banner bearing thel egend:
. . . . - T-i .. .1 nm A m an Hmon t tfi tVl

The association adopted almost
unanimously a set of resolutions in
troduced by Mrs. Helen Ring Robin
son, a member of the Colorado state
senate, calling upon President Wilson,
"in his forthcoming message to con
gress to adopt the woman suffrage
constitutional amendment as an admin
istration measure and to urge con
gress to take immediate and favorable
iction upon it," urging the senate to
pass the amendment; and asking the
house to create a committee on wom
an suffrage.
