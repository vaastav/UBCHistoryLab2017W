elU-s. 194,11,719. The report ia very voluminous,
and contains a laxut) number of tabulated atatc-
ments.
Uixty-three hundred and sixty-three persons
have boon arrested for illicit distilling, and
twentv-aeven nmcrrft and emoiovea killed and
forty-oitiht woundoii. while engaged in enforcing
the internal revenue laws. In this connection
the Commissioner says: " it U clear to mv mind

placed upon Btate oourts for punishing riti
sens wno commit muraer nr assault to muruer
upon our'othcers while employed in the per

undertake tho trial and punibhiuent of persons
who are guilty of murder aud aaoault t murder
of oftiwra while engaged in, or on account of the

During the four months of the present fiscal
year tne uecrease in receipts irom tonacco ana
liurt, as compared with the corresponding period
last yuar, waa i.ia6,5UJ. These figure indicate
a reduction for the year in receipt from this
source of over t7,OU0.UO0. The iucreasiug pros
perity of the country which ha given so favora
ble au impulse to all business ha largely bene
fited the tobacco trade, and receipt hve in con
seuuenoe not suffered so heavily a waa antici
pated. Experience ha shown that no material
advantage has inured to the consumers in a re
duction of price, by reason of a reduction of tax.

Horse Car Stables Burned in New York.
NEW YORK, Nov. 25.
One of the lareewt fires for some time
past in this city tonk place this morn
ing. Shortly before seven e'clock a
tire was discovered in the stables of the
Eighth Avenue Horse Car Railroad,
and notwithstanding that within live
minutes after the discovery fullv forty
streams of water were turned upon the
ainaiag nnuttinfg, it waa irnij' whan I hard
was nothing further for the flames to
feed upon that the firemen obtained mas
tery. 1 he stables were in the four-
story brick buildings fronting two
buudrea feet on .hip-hth avenue, and
four hundred feet on Forty-ninth and
j-utietn streets, in the rear, on tbe
Ninth avenue side is a wilderness of
carpenter and wagon shops and a
mountain of oil barrels, many thous
ands being stacked to a height of thirty
or forty feet. These were Bsved by tho
efforts of the firemen, who, from the
beginning, specially directed their ef
forts to this point, to prevent a general
conflagration among the tenement
nouses on JSintb. avenue. Almost be
fore the movement to save the stock in
the stables could be made, the flames
burst simultaneously from tho win
dows on Fiftieth and Forty-ninth
street sides. It became clear that the
building was doomed to destruction.
Cars stored on the ground floor were
run out and saved. Horses stalled on
the upper floors were untied and run
down inclined planes to tho ground.
There were nearly 800, and the work
of getting them out was one of great
difficulty and danger. Blinded by
smoke and frightened by the flame's
they kicked and reared and over 100
had to be abandoned to destruction.
Their piteous whinnyings could be
heard above the roar ot the flames.
Three upper floors were ono vast sheet
of fire. Two brick buildings, one a
liquor store and the other a restaurant
cut into the stable building on the
corner, were saved. At this point iu
the stables an immense quantity of
hay in bales were stored. When these
caught fire a sudden bursting of tho
bars that bound the bales caused an ex-
Elosion that shattered the side of the
uildmg and threw the brick wall into
the street. It fell with crushing force
npon the ladder on which were Chief
Campbell, Foreman John Welsh of en
gine No. 8, and Fireman Henry C. Mount
and John Hegan of the same company.
Each and all wer bailed under the
smoking muss and a shout of horror
went up from the spectators. Their com
rades instantly fell to the work of res
cue, andsoon all were recovered, bruised,
bleeding and insensible. Mount had his
skull and one of his legs fractured, and
was alBO injured internally. He died
an hour afterward in the hospital.
Regan had a leg broken and was badly
cut. Chief Campbell and Foreman
Welsh were painfully but not seriously
hurt, and remained on duty. Hardly
had the fireman and spectators recov
ered from tho excitement caused by
tho fall of the wall when it was
rumored that a fireman had fallen into
tho burning building, but a muster of
companies later showed all men pres
ent except tlrose taken to tbe hospital.
Soon afterwards the walls on Fifteenth
street fell with a crash.
Chief Fisher of the Eighth Battalion
was injured in the back by a falling
wall, and Fireman David Closey was
seriously injured. Mount has a wife
and four children. He was buried un
der the ruins, and when discovered was
lying with a heavy iron girder across
bis chest, his skua was lracturea and
several ribs broken.
It is believed the fire started by spon
taneous combustion, among hay stored
on the third floor, which has been re
cently brought in and was yet damp.
Thore has been no fire in tbe building
for weens.
The loss is estimated at about $250,-
000; insurance, $27,000.
Statistics officially compiled for the
German Government show that the
present popnlation of the Empire very
considerably exceeds that of 1416. Ia
1875 it was 42,727,360, for the whole
country, of which Prussia has 25,742,
404, and Bavaria 6.032.S70: in 1815 the
population of the whole country was
24,831,306: for Prussia, 13,706,978, and
for Bavaria, 3,607,036. The figures for
tne otner ana smaller Mates are in
about tbe same proportion, being in
the average an increase of nearly 100

A Powerful Electric Eel.
M. Marcy, who for some years bas
been engaged in the study ot these very
singular aquatioanimals, bas announced
to the Academy of Sciences that he has
received a living specimen of the gym
notus or electric eel from Peru, ana that
it is -lodged in his laboratory at the
College de trance, where, ny the by
any visitor is admitted to inspect it
The gymnotus is that peculiar fish
which at its pleasure gives electrical
discbarges, and thereby stuns the ani
mal it desires to make its prey. Its
nriuoioal home is in the rivers and
lagoons of South America, whero it is
the terror of all other animals, not even
excepting the cayman, the American
crocodile. One of these eels two metres
in length can give a shock which will
reduce to powerlessness tbe oxen and
horses that come down to tbe stream to
drink at the points it frequents, and
thus render them an easy prey to their
aquatio enemies. Man himself, although
not as sensitive to tho shock as other
animals, is bUU liable to very serious
inconvenience from its effects. M.
Marcy has found, during his investiga
tions, that a gymnotus of a metre in
length has an electrical surfaco of about
sis hundred square feet, equal to a very
powerful battery. The animal, owing
to its length and the suppleness of its
body, can produco different electrical
effects, according as it is in a straight
lino, concave, or convex as regards its
prey. Its general modo of procedure
is to form a semi-circlo and place the
fish it is intent on in the diameter of
the circuit. Whon the discharge is
delivered, tho prey, as if struck by a
thunderbolt, is rendered powerless; the
fryninotus swims round it, as if to be
assured of the eflicacy of the shock, and
then swallows its victim. Theso are
not tho only fish which possess this
singular power of launching eloctrical
discharges on their prey or on their
enemies. Many others are known, but
far inferior in force to the terrible
gymnotus. Among them are the torpedo
hah and some species of skato which
inhabit thu coasts of Great Britain and
Franco, and some other species found
in the Nilo and Senegal. Galitjnanx't

Report Secretary of the Interior.
WASHINGTON, Nov. 27.
The Becretsry of the Interior, in his annual re
port to the President, discusses the Indian ques
tion. He says whatever trouble and perplexi
ties the presence of Indiana among us may
cause, every man who loves justice, and who
values the honor of the American nRme.will admit
it ia our solemn duty to leave nothing untried to
lircpare a better late than extirmination and a
better rule than that of brute force for the origin
al occuitaiit of the soil upon which so many null
ions of our ieopie have grown prosperous and luii
py. That ail Indian on this Northern Continent
nave been savages and that mauy of them are
savage now is truo, but it ia also true that many
tribes have risen to a promising degree of civili
sation, and there is no reason to doubt that the
rest, if wisely guided, will lm found caable of
following their example. Of the i'lO.Omi Indians
in the United Htatea there have been since the
pacification of the Hiouxat no time more than rive
hundred in hostilecoiithct with white. Neither
does it apiiear that auch mrtial disturbances
have been provoked by the absence, or prevented
by the presence of the military force. Ot the
four disturbance that have occurred within the
last two years, three broke out in tbe immediate
presence of such military force, and only one
without it. At tins moment a band or lea
than eight hundred Ctca nnd another of
about one hundred aud fifty Indian ma
rauders in New Mexico, in all less than one thou
sand of an Indian population of a quarter of a
miilion.are causing serious trouble In fact, the
number of white desperadoes who were, within
the past twelve inouttia, banded together in New
Mctico for niuriler nH rnoine, Urirpr f hn
tliat ot the Inoians receutlv on the warpath near
the bouthern part of tbe Territory. While I am
by no means disposed to belittle the deplorable
nature of Indian disturbance, or the great value
of military force in suppressing them, it is but
just to Indians to point out tho important fact
that disturbances and hostility is the exception,
and peaceable conduct the rulo; that a very large
majority or inoian reserrarions are in a condi
tion of uninterrupted uuict. without the oreence
of a C'.erciug force; and the equally significant
experience tnat tne more civiiizea an Indian be
came, the more certainly can his peaceable and
orderly conduct be depended upon.
The Decretory claims to have an Indian policy,
and says the ends steadily pursued by the De
partment are the following:
First. To set the Indians to work a agri
culturist or herders; thus to break np their
uabiU ol savage Ute and to make them seU-sup-porting.
occunn. to educate tneir youtn ot Dotn sexc
so as to introduce to the growing generatiuu
civilized ideas, wants and aspiration.
Third. To allot parcels of land to Indians in
severalty, and to give tbem individual title to
tneir larnis in lecinaiionaoieroraceriaiii period,
thus to foster the nride of individual ownership
of pmierty instead of their former dependence
upon me trioo, wun us territory nciu in com
mon. Fourth. When a settlement in severalty with
individual title is accomplished, to dispose, with
their con, nt, of thewe lauds on their reserva
tions, which aro not settled or used by them, the
proceeds to form a fund for their benefit which
will gradually relievo the Oovernment of ex
penses at present provide! lor oy annual appro
priations
t utn. wnen rnis is accompuaneu, w xreai ine
Indians like other inhabitant of the United
btAtoe under the laws of the land.
This policy, if adopted and supported by
Congress and carried out with wisdom and
uriniicsa, will, in Ins opinion, gradually
bring almut a solution of the Indiau prob
lem without injustice to tho Indians, and
lso without obstructing tho development of
the country, it will raise them to a level of civ
ilization at least equal to that of the civilized
tribes in the Indian territory, and probably
higher, considering the stimulu of individual
ownership of land. It will not take away from
them by force what in justice aud equity le
longa to them, but induce them to part with
what they could not cultivate and use them
selves for fair compensation. It will open to
progress and improvement large district new
held by Indians which will then be of no real
advantage to them and are now to nobody else.
Kcferring to the assertion frequently made
that tribal relations must bo broken up and the
reservation system must be abandoned, etc.,
HccretArv Kcbiira olmerve that an attempt to
accomplish thice object at once, all over tho
country, without intermediate atagea Dy mili
tary loree, would undoubtedly result in many
ease in Indian wars of unprecedented magni
tude and bitterness, which would require a
much larger army than we at present pimseas,
and prove in the end not only most inhuman,
but in Olood and treasure the most expeualve ol
all niethnrls.
The (Secretary says the cause of the Ute trouble
cannot be found in any just complaint on the
part of the Utea. It is expected the occurrence
of this trouble and transactions following there
upon will result in such arrangement as will be
calculated to prevent for the future himtilo con
tact between the white inhabitant aud Indians
n that part uf the country.
Testing the Cable.
People who cross to and from Brook
lyn by ferry aro apt to look up at the
great East River bridge and wonder
what assurance they nave mat wnen
the heavy floor is built and loaded with
travel it will safely be held up oy tne
suspending cables. These cables have
just been tested by a machine which is
the most elaborate and perfect of tbe
kind in the world. It is the one planted
on tne uovcrnmcni grounas at me
Watcrtown, Mass., Arsenal, designed
by Mr. A. H. Kmcry, and is, indeed, a
marvel of skilled construction, for it
shows how many ounces are needed to
break a piece of thread, and bow many
tons to fracture a steel beam. Ihe
apparatus is microscopic in accuracy,
insomucb as it registers, in a Dreaaing
weight of a million pounds, within one
pound of the mass needed. This was
the machine selected to test the suspend
ing cables, and Messrs. William II.
Payne and Isaac Newton, engineers
connected with the Brooklyn bridge,
recently spent four days in the tests at
the Arsenal, which is under charge of
Col. T. T. S. I.aidley, of the Ordnance
Corps. Instead of using small sections
of the suspenuiug cauies, iney iook
lengths that would make the results
decisive. Not to go into technicalities,
the tests were entirely satisfactory, and
showed that the precautions taken in
uuttinir together the parts were ample
for their purpose. The suspending
cables were found by the engineers to
Dossess a strength much greater than
is required to resist the strain that
will be put upon them in actual use.
A thorn? ht suggested bv this test is that
it is matter of regret tbat a machine so
useful should be left on one side of the
central lines of iron and steel con
struction. It cost the Government
nearly 100,000, and it would be well
to have it used freely by the people.

I congratulate CVmgress on the successful execu

and in the manner contemplsti'd by law, Unit

Hincc the first of January last they have been
Cromptly redeemed ou presentation, and in all

parts of the country, they aro received and raid
out as the equivalent of coin. The demand ni
on tho Treasury for gold and silver in exchange

large. The excess of the precious metals deMs

With a currency equivalent in value to

other nations in trade and tmxluclion. The in-cn-Msing

balanco of trade in our favor, which has been
paid in gold, from the 1st of July last to Novem
ber, to the amount of about tuD.OnO.0ilO. Hince
tho resumption of siiecie payment there ha also
been a marked and gratifying improvement of
the public credit. Tho bonds of tbe Oovernment
bearing only four per cent., interest have been
sold at or alKive par. aufiicient in amount to pay
oft all of tho National debt which was redeema
ble under present laws. 1 ho amount of interest
saviil annually bv Ihe process of refunding the
debt, since March 1, 1H77, ia tl4.2U7.177. The
bonds sold were largely in small sums, and tho
number of our citizens now holding the public
securities is much creator than ever before. The
amount of tho National debt which matures
within less than two years ia t i'Ji. 121.70 1, of
which 5 fl.OOi i,( I bear interest at tho rate of
five jier cent., and the balance is in bonds bear
ing six ier cent, interest. It is believed that
this iart of the public debt can be refunded by
the issue of four per cent, tiond, and, by the re
duction of interest which will thua be effected,
about tll,0l,l can be annually saved to the
Treasury. To secure this imMrtant reduction
of interest to be aid by the United Htat?, fur
ther legislation is required, which, it ia hojied,
will be provided by Congress during it present
session.

Congress the imisirtance of authorizing the Sec
retary of the Treasury to susiend the coinage of
silver dollars uimiu tbe present legal ratio. The
market value of the silver dollar being nniformly
and largely less than the market value of the
gold dollar, it is obviously impracticable to
maintain them at par with each other if both
are coined without limit. If the cheajier coin is
forced in circulation it will, if coined without
limit, soon become the sole standard of value,
and thus defeat the desired object, which is a
currency of both cold and silver, whlchshall lie

While the reform measures of another Gov
ernment are of no authority for ns, they are en
titled to influence, to the extent to whicn tneir
intrinsic wisdom, and their adaptation to rear
institutions and social life, may ooinmeud them
to our consideration.
I he views 1 have heretofore expressed conoern
inir the defect and abuses in our civil adminis
tration remain unchanged, excepi in so far a
an enlarged experience lis deepened my sense
nf the duty both of officers and of the people
themselves to co-operate for thoir removal, lae
grave evil and perils tif a partisan-spoil system
of appointment to office and of office tenure-, are
now generally recognized, in ine rnMnnumm u,
the great parties, in the report of Department,
in the debates and proceedings of Congress, in
the message of Kxeeutive. tho gravity of the
ovils ha been pointed out and the need or their
reiorm nas neen somiiwi.
To command the necessary support, orerv
measure of reform must be based on common
right and justice: and must be compatible with
tho healthy existence of great parties, which are
inevitable and essential in free estate.
wiim s!k iwropio nave approved a poliey at a
National election, confidence on thepnrtof the
officer they have selected, and of the advisers
who, in accordance with our political institu
tions, should bo consulted, in the policy which
it is their duty to carry into effect, ia indispensa
ble. It is eminently prwpeT that they should ex
plain it before tho peopio, ss well an lllnstrate it
spirit in the performance of theiiofficial duties.
Very different considerations apply to the
greater numlier of those who fill the stiliordinste
places in the civil service. Their responsibility
is to their superiors in official position. It I
their duty toiibey the legal instructions of those
upon whom that authority is devolved, and their
I .est public service consist in the discbarge of
their functions irrespective of partisan politics.
Their duties are the same, whatever party is in
power and whatever policy prevails. As a con
sequence, it follows that their tenure of office
should not depend on the prevalence of any pol
icy or the supremacy of any party, but should
bo determined by their capacity to serve the
people most usef ullv, quite irrespective of par
tisan interest. The same considerations that
should govern the tenure should also prevail in
the appointment. disciilineand removal of the
subordinate. The authority of appointment
and removal ia not a perquisite, which may in:
used to aid a friend or reward a partisan, but is
a trust to be exercised in the public interest, un
der all the sanctions which attend the obligation
to apply the public funds only for public pur
pose. Kvery citizen has an eqnal right to the honor
and profit of entering the public service of bis
country. The only lust ground of discrimina
tion is the measure of cnaracter and caiaicily he
has to make that service most useful to the peo
pio. Except in cases where, upon just and
-..Oni-rvl .nni,ln. na.ntM.n tho thlTir lwl
sions, offices and promotions are bestowed a ro
warila for past services, their bestowal upon any
theory which disregards personal merit is an act
of injustice to the citizen, a well as a breach uf
tnat trust subject to wuicn tne appointing power
is held. ...
lu the light of these principle, it become of
great importance to provide just and adequate
means, especially for every department, and
large administrative office, where personal dis
crimination on the part of it head is not practi
cable, for ascertaining those qualifications to
which appointment and removals should have
reference. To fail to provide such means ia not
only to deny the opportunity of ascertaining the
tarts upon whicn tne most rignteou claim w
office depends, but, of necessity, to discourage
all wortiiy aspirant, by handing over appoint
ments and removals to mere influence and
favoritism. If it ia the right of tho
worthiest claimant to gain the appointment.and
the interest of the people to bestow it upon him.
it would seem clear that a wise and just method
of ascertaining personal fitness for office must
be an important and permanent function of
every just and wiw government. It has long
since become impossible, in the great offices for
those having the duty vt nomiuation and ap
pointment to personally examine into the indi
vidual qualifications of more than a small pro-
Kirtion of those seeking office; and. with the en
.rgemont of the civil service, that proportion
must continue to become less.
In tho earlier year of the Government the
subordinate office were so few in number that
it was quite easy for those making appointments
and promotions to personally ascertain tbe mer
it of candidate. 1'arty managers and methods
had not then become powerful agencies of coer
cion, hostile to tbe free and just exercise of the
apiMiinting power.
A large and responsible part of the duty of re
storing the civil service to the desired purity and
efficiency rest upon the President, and it is my
purpose to do what ia within my power to ad
vance such prudent and gradual measure of re
form a wilt most surely and rapidly bring abont
that radical change of system essential to make
our administrative methods satisfactory toa free
and intelligent people. By a proper exercise sf
authority, it is in the power of the Executive to
do much to promote such a reform. But it can
not be too clearly undrt.xi that nothing ade
quate can be accomplished without co-operation
on tho iart of Congress, and considerate and in
telligent support among the people. Heforms
which challenge the generally accepted theories
of parties, ana demand changes in the methods
of department, are not the work of a day. Their
permanent foundations must lie laid in sound
principles, and in an experience which demon
strates their wisdom ana exposes the errors of
their adversaries. Every worthy officer desire
to make hi official action a gain and an honor to
his country, but the peopio themselves, far more
than their officers in public station, are inter
ested in a pure, ooonornical and vigorous admin
istration. ,
By lawa enacted in 1853 and 1H55. and now in
suhstanoe incorporated in tho llevised Statutes,
tha prsc tice of axbitrmry amioinlmc'DU to the sev
eral andordinate grade in the great department
to be conducted by departmental boards of ex
aminers, were provided for and made conditions
of admission to the public service. These stat
utes aro a decision by Congress that examina
tions of some wirt. as to attainments and
ciacity. are essential to the well-being of the
pubiio service. The important questions since
the ensetmeutof these laws have been a to the
character of these examinations, and whether
official favor and partisan influence, or com
mon right and merit, were to control the ac
cess to the examinations. In practice,
those examinations have not always been
oiien to worthy imrsons generally, who
might wish to be examined. Official favor
itism and partisan influence, aa a rule, appear to
have designated those w ho alone were permitted
