QUESTION OF FINANCE.
„ „
St. Louis Dec. 15 -Hon. T. i. Loots
of Counersville, Ind.. who was a can
dulate for the position of United States
treasurer, and who was chairuiau of
the committee which framed the call
for the monetary convention held at
Indianapolis, claims that several of the
suggestions in President McKinley's
message, and 8 -eretar, Gage's reoom
mendations to cougresson the currency
and baukingquestions. were embodied,
as early as December, 1890. in an article
written by him, and much of it wasap
proved by Secretary Sherman.
The following is part of the article
writteu by Mr. Roots:
••The endless chain would be a thing
of the past, with a full treasury, es
pecially if the greenbacks were re
issued only in exchange for gold. As
to the national banks, if a 50-year bond
at two percent were issued as the
basis of banking circulation, and the
banks were permitted to issue
to tbe par value of their bonds,
take the tax off of the circulation.
aud permit banks of a capital of $25,
000 to organize, it would accelerate
the formation of banks throughout the
country, and we would not hear of the
bunking question for years to come."

Chicago, Dec. 15.—After an existence
of nearly a quarter of a century, the

verge of dissolution. At tlie end of a

World's Wheat Supply.
CASH WHEAT" IS NOW AT A PREMIUM.
II
More Hat Been Sold than Can be Deliv
ered—America Now Hat the Oppor
tunity to Make lie Own Price
tar the Cereal.
Chicago, Dec. 15.—Wm. T. Baker,
pres.dent of the board of trade, says
with reference to the unusual condi
tions of wheat:
"Cash wheat la at a premium over fu
ture delivery here andlnallpartsofthe
world, because more of it has been sold
than can be delivered. Wheat is scares
all over the world. Not enough was
grown last year to supply the de
mand. America now has the
opportunity to make Its own price for
wheat . It has, in the past, been con
sidered by many to be a blessing for us
to supply the world with cheap wheat,
even though our own farmers hardly
could make both ends meet ou the cost
of production. Now, perhaps, iu view
of tlie prosperity which has come to
tliis nation, from higher prices, there
will be less sympathy for those oper
ating to depress grain values below
the values normally adjusted by de
mand and supply.
"In the past unlimited quantities of
wheat have been sold on the market,
and resold, with no demand for its de
livery. Now, however, the wheat is
wanted so badly by consumers that
contracts calling for delivery can stand
for no 'wind' wheat. We shall prob
ably sec the same tight conditions in
May wheat, when May comes, as we
now see in December wheat.
"I think that this country already
lias exported much of the wheat which
it will soon need for its own consump
tion, and that the full scarcity is not
by auy means yet appreciated."
The Tribune, of this city, says:
"During the last few days the trade
generally has been working around to
a theory something like this:
"Armour aud Leiter have crossed
weapons aud recognized their respec
tive points of advantage and strength.
Leiter will handle the December deal
as carefully as possible, and realize
just as much profit by sales as the mar
ket will stand. He will then take some
cash wheaton delivery, but practical
ly leave the cash situation to Armour.
Ha can go over to May with better
prospects than he went over into Sep
tember or over into December.
Armour will then be left with Chi
cago in control of the cash situation,
and with foreigu demand and domestic
requirements as a result of millers sell
ing their stocks ou the high Chicago
premium. This would furnish a basis
for advancing prices and give Armour
an opportunity for merchandising
wheat on a scale which was not thought
possible at the beginning of the crop
year.
