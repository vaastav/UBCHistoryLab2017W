RESULTS OF SEVER YEARS'
There Are, However, Many Things to be Regulated Before
Evils Are Eliminated, He Says, and Reiterates His Sug

Conservation of the Natural Resources of the Nation.

OVER EXPENDITURES IS PROOF Of THE COUNTRY'S PROSPERITY
Looking Backward Over the Seven Years and Three Months He Was Been at the Head of

Excel Past Records and Provide for Posterity.
Washington, Dec. 8. With the
convening of Congress today the an
nual message of President Roosevelt
was given the closest attention in
both the House and the Senate. The
reading wue begun Immediately af
ter t.ie two houses convened and was
interrupted In many places by ap
plause from the floor and galleries.
The message follows.
To the Senate and House of Repre
sentatives: Finances. ,
The financial standing of the na
tion at the present time Is excellent,
and tha financial management of the
nation's Interests Interests by
the
rnvernment during the last
seven
vears has shown the most
satlsfac-
fory results. But our currency sys
tem Is Imperfect, and "it Is earnestly
to be hoped that the currency com
mission will be able to propose a
thoroughly good system which will
do away with the existing defects.
During the period from July 1.
J9UX. to September 30, 1908. there
was an Increase In the imount of
money In circulation of 902.91,39.
The Increase In the per capita dur
ing this period was $".06. Within
this time there were several occa
sions when It was necessary for the
treasury department to come to the
relief of the money market by pur
chases or redemptions of l.'nited
States bonds; by Increasing deposit?
In national banks; by stimulating ad
ditional issues of national bank notes,
and by facilitating Importations from
abroad of gold. Our imperfect cur
Bvsiem has made these pro
ceedings necessary, and they were

In short, during the seven year

net surplus of nearly one hundrei
millions of receipts over expenditures
a reduction of the interest-b. arini
debt by ninety millions, in spite o'
the extraordinary expense of the Pan
air.a canal, and a saving of nearlj
nine millions on the annual interest 1
charge. This is an exceedingly sat-I
isfactory showing, especially in view:
of the fact that during this period 1
the nation has never hesitated to un
dertake any expenditure that it re
garded as necessary. There have
been no new taxes and no increase of
texes; on the contrary, some taxes
have been taken off; there has been
a reduction of taxation.
Corporations.
As regards the great corporations
engaged in interstate business, and
especially the railroads, I can only
repeat what 1 have already again
and again said In mj messages to the
Congress. I believe that, under the
Interstate clause of the constitution
the I'nited States has complete and
paramount light to control an agen
cles of Interstate commerce, and 1
believe that the national government
alone can exercise this right with
wisdom and effectiveness so as both
to secure Justice from, and to do
justice to the great corporations
which are the most important fac
tors In modern business. I believe
that it is worse than folly to attempt
to prohibit all combinations as is
done by the Sherman anti-trust law.
because such a law can be enforced
only Imperfectly and unequally, and
Its enforcement works almost as
much hardship as good. I strongly
advocate thnt Instead of an unwise
effort to prohibit all combinations,
there shall be substituted a law which
shall expressly permit combinations
which are in the Interest of the pub
lic, but shall at the same time give
to some agency of the national gov
ernment full power of control am
supervision over them. One of the
chief features of this control should
he securing entire publicity in all
matters which the public has aright
to know, and furthermore, the power,
not !v Judicial but by executive ac
tion, to prevent or put a stop to every
form of improper favoritism or other
wrong doing.
The railways of the country should
hi- put completely under the inter
state commerce commission and re
moved from the domain of the anti
trust law. The power of the com
mission should be made thorough-going,
so that it could exercise com
plete supervision and control over
th.- Issue of securities as wen as ..-,
the raising and lowering 01 rates.
regards rates, at least, this power
should he summary. The power to
Investigate the financial operations
and accounts of the railways has been
n- of the most valuable features In
recent . legislation, rower i ih..i-.v
. 111b. nations anil traffic agreements
hould be explicitly conferred upon
the railroads, the permission or wo
nimlsslon being first gamed ana
the combination or agreement nen.s
published In all Its details. In me
int. rust of the public the representa
tives f.r the nubile should have com
plete power to see that the railroads
do their duty by the public, and
matter of course this power should
also be exercised si as to see mai
.10 injustice Is done to the railroads.
The shareholders, the employes and
the shippers all have interests that
must be guarded. It is to the inter
ests of !l of them that no swind
ling stock speculation should he al
lowed, and that th-re should be no
Improper issuance of securities. The
guiding Intelligence necessary for the
so,.. . ssful building and successful
management of railroads should rc
elve ample remuneration; but no
man

inc.-s: there mu-t be no del' lauding

"reighl. or callous disregard "f the
ights and needs of the employes. In
uldltion t" this the int-i-sts of the
shareholders, of the employes, and of
he shippers should all be guarded as
igainst another. To give any
me of them undue and Improper con
sideration Is to do Injustice to the
others. Rates must be made us low-
1
as compatible with giving proper re
turns to all the employes of the rail
road, from the highest to the lowest,
and proper returns to the sharehold
ers; but they must not, for Instance,
be reduced in such fashion as to ne
cessitate a cut in the wages of the em
ployes or the abolition of the proper
and legitimate profits of honest share
holders. Telegraph and telephone companies
engaged in Interstate business, should
be put under the Jurisdiction of the
interstate commerce commission.
Jt is very earnestly to be wished
thut our people, through their repre
sentatives, should act In this matter.
It Is hard to say whether most dam
age to the country at large would
come from entire failure on the part
of the pifblic to supervise and von
trol the actions of the great corpora
tions, or from the exercise of the
necessary governmental power in a
way which would do Injustice and
wrong to the corporations. Both the
preachers of an unredistrlcted indi
vidualism, and the preachers of an
oppression which would deny to abb
men of business the just reward of
their Initiative and business sagacity,
are advocating policies that would be
fraught with the gravest harm to the
whole country. To permit every law
less capitalist, every law-defying cor
poration, to take any action, no mat
ter how iniquitous, in the effort to
Secure an improper profit, and to
build up privilege, would be ruinous
to1 the republic and would mark the
abandonment of the effort to secure In
the industrial world the spirit of dem
ocratic fair-dealing. On the other
hand, to attack these wronRs In that
spirit of demagogy which can see
wrong only when committed by the
man of wealth, and Is dumb and
blind in the presence of wrong com
mitted against men of property or
by men of no property, is exactly as
evil as corruptly to defend the wrong
doing of men of wealth. The war we
wage must be waged against miscon
duct, against wrong-doing, wherever
it Is found; aid we must stand heart
ily for the rights of every decent man.
whether he bo a man of great wealth
or a man who earns his livelihood as
a wage worker or a tiller of the soli.
It Is to the interest of all of us
that there should be a premium put
upon individual Initiative and Indi
vidual capacity, and in ample reward
for the great directing intelligence
alone competent to manage the great
business operations of today. It is
well to keep in mind that exactly
as tne anarcnist is tne worst enemj
of liberty and the reactionary the
worst enemy of order, so the men
who defend the rights of property
have most to fear from the wrong
doers of great wealth, and the mi n
who are championing popular rights
have most to fear from the dema
gogues who in the name of popular
rights would do wrong to and op
press honest business men, honest men
of wealth, for the success of either
t tie of w rong-doer necessarily Invites
a violent reaction against the cause
the wrong-doer nominally upholds. In
point of danger to the nation there is
nothing to choose between on the one
hand the corrupt ionlst. the bribe-giv
er, the bribe-taker, the man who em
ploys his great talent to swindle his
fellow citizens on a large scale, and.
on the other hand, the preacher

wrong-headed men to try to destroy
the instruments upon which our pros
perity mainly rests. I.et each groui

the shortcomings to which that group

see th" business community in a spirit
of unhealthy class consciousness tie
plore the effort to hold to account on
der the law the wealthy men who In
tlu ir management of great
corpoi a
tiiins, whether railroad, street rail
ways, or other industrial enterprises,
have behuved in a way that revolts
tha conscience of the plain, decent
people. Such nn uttitude can not be
condemned too severely, for men of
property should recognize thnt they
Jeopardize the rights of property when
they fall henrtily to Join In the effort
to do away with the abuses of wealth.
On the other hand, those who ndvo
eate proper control on behalf of the
public, through the state, of these
great corporations, and of the wealth
engaged on a giant scale In business
operations, must ever keep In mind
that unless they do scrupulous Jus
tice to the corporations unless they
permit ample profit and cordially en
courage capable men of business so
long as they act with honesty, they
are striking at the root of our na
tional well being; for in the long run.
under the mere pressure of material
distress, the people a- a whole would
probably go back to the reign of an
unrestricted individualism rather than
submit to a control by the state so
drastic and so foolish, conceived iti a
spirit of such unreasonable and nar
row hostility to wealth, as to pre
vent business operations from being
profitable, and therefore to bring
ruin upon the entire business com-
munlty, and ultimately upon the en- I
tire body or citizens. j
The opposition to government con-i
trol of these great corporations makes
Its most effective effort in the shape
of an appeal to the old doctrine of j
states' rights. Of course there are i
many sincere men who now believe J
in unrestricted individualism In bust-
ness. Just as there were formerly
many sincere men who believed in
slavery thnt is. in the unrestricted
right of an individual to own another
Individual. These men do not by
themselves have great weight, how
ever. The effective fight against ad
equate government control and super
vision of individual, and especially of
corporate, wealth engaged In Inter
state business Is chiefly done under
cover; and especially under cover of
an appeal to states' rights. Tt Is not
at all infrequent to read in the same
speech a denunciation of predatory
wealth fostered by special privilege
and defiant of both the public wel
fare and law of the land, and a de
nunciation of centralization in the
central government of the power to
deal with this centralized and or
ganized wealth. Of course, the pow
er set forth In such twin denuncia
tions amounts to abs i'utelv nothing,
for the first naif is nullified by the
second half. The chief reason, among
the many sound and compelling rea
sons, that led to the formation of the
national government, was the absolute
need that the I'nion, and not the
si veral atates, should deal with Inter
state and foreign commerce; and the
power to deal with Interstate com
merce was granted absolutely and
plenarily to the central government
and was exercised completely as re
gards the only instruments of inter
state commerce known In those days
the waterways, the high roads, as
well as the partnerships of Individuals
who then conducted all of what bus!
ness there was. Interstate commerce
is now chiefly conducted by rail
roads; and the great corporation has
supplanted the mass of small part
nerships or Individuals. Tho pro
posal to make the national govern
ment supremo over, and therefore to
give it complete control over, the
railroads and other instruments of
Interstate commerce is merely a pro
posal to carry out to the letter one
of the prime purposes, If not the
prime purpose for which the consti
tution was founded. It does not rep
resent centralization. It represents
merely the acknowledgment of the
patent fact that centralization has
already come In business. If this
Irresponsible outside business power

the ceneral nubile It can only be
controlled In one way; by giving ad
equate power of control to the one

power the national government
Forty or fifty separate state govern-
nn nts can not exercise that power
over eomorations doing business In
most h11 of them; first, because they
absolutely lack the authority to deal
with Interstate business In uny form
and second, because of the Inevitable
conflict of authority sure to arise In
the effort to enforce different kinds
of state regulation, often ineonslst
