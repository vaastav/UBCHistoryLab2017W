RAILROADS RESTS
WITH PRESIDENT
»he president wished It, although
Government May Seize Con
trol of All Transportation
Lines in Country Before
Christmas.
W&sHngton, Dec. 7.—Government
operation of railroads ]iung in the bal
ance today. On President Wilson de
pended whether the government should
loan the railways one billion dollars
or put them under a federal dictator
to end the war freight jam.
Some congressmen looked for the
president to seize control of the rail
roads before Christinas. They predict
ed that legislation for unification of
the lines would mean a long delay. The
president desires immediate relief from
railroad congestion. Under authority
hé already possesses, he could place
every mile of track under federal con
trol by a pen's stroke.
. AGAINST FEDERAL CONTROL.
The four railroad brotherhoods are
united with the railway executives
against government control. President
Wilson is understood to have been told
this when the labor leaders saw him
recently regarding their wage de
mands. The brotherhoods favor finan
cial and legislative aid to the carriers
to enable them to unify their opera
tions ns suggested by the interstate
commerce commission under direction
of a war board.
The railroad executives today were
preparing estimates of the amount
needed for 1918 to place the lines on a
war efficiency basis. These estimates
are to be submitted to Senator New
lnnds foi^presentation by him to the
president on Monday. The president Is
shortly afterward expected to make
known his views, possibly in a special
message to congress. v
TO FOl-LOW PRESIDENT.
Legislators said theV would follow!
the president's recommendations. One
senator, a labor sponsor, even said he
would vote for an anti-strike bill if
in
the senator's opinion such legislation
"might precipitate a labor revolution."
Acting Chairman Sims of the house
interstate commerce committee, fav
ors immediate action by the president
to seize the railroads.
"Then he could come to congress for
supplemental legislation to guarantee
railroad securities or whatever mea
sures advisable,*' said Pirns.
"It would take lx months to take the
nterstate commerce commission's re
commendations for unification under
the railroads' own control."

REPORTED BY STONE.
Doubt that the senate would take up
(he war resolution today was removed
when Senator Stone, chairman of the
foreign relations committee obtained
unanimous consent for its immediate
consideration. La Follette was ab
sent at that time.
Chairman Stone's report, accom
panying the senate committee's reso
lution declared:
"It is manifestly impossible that the
United States and Austria Hungary
aliould be at peace while Germany and
the United States are at war.
•'The United States is supporting
Italy as well as England an* France
and these countries are supporting the
United States in the war they all are
waging against Germany," Stone con
tinued.
A COMMON ENEMY.
"1 cannot see that It could make any
difference where American. British.
French or Italian troops might he for
the moment located. If all of them are
co-oporattng in one general movement
against a common enemy, these groups
may be shifted to meet the exigencies
of war."
This clearly intimated what the
house committee also reported that
American troops may soon be fighting
In Italy.
"In the circumstances, it is impos
sible that amicable relations should be
continued with Austria," he said.
TAKEN UP IN HOUSE.
The house, under previous agree
ment, immediately after convening,
took up the resolution.
Miss Jeanette Rankin, the lady from
Montana, whose vote against the Ger
man war declaration caused speculation
over her attitude today was absent
from the house. Her secretary re
ported Miss Rankin ill, but the gen
eral belief among congressmen was
that she had "sidestepped" the vole.
It was said she would be In her seat
tomorrow.
Attempts of Representative Flood In
the house to obtain an agreement for
final vote at 5 p. m. failed when sev
eral members, Including "Unci* Joe"
Cannon, appeared anxious to orate.
Representative Cooper, Wisconsin,
pacifist, who voted for the resolution
In committee, was prepared for a two
hour address.
Representative London, New Tork
city Socialist, had a speech to readi
ness, upholding the "philosophy of In

SPIES PROPOSED
STEPS TO PURGE
M rmTNTOV nt
LUUmlU W
Attorney General, in Annual
Report, Recommends Leg
islation Directed at the
Enemy Aliens.
Washington, Dec. 7.—Steps further
to purge this country of spies and
traitors, based on President Wilson's
recommendations to congress, were
taken by Attorney General Gregory In
his annual report today.
Gregory recommended law* to hob
ble the entrance and exit of aliens,
to make violation of the president's
«lien enemy regulations a "prison
term at hard labor" offense Instead of
an "Internment camp and a nie« soft
berth affair."
8YSTEM OF SPY TRAPS.
The vast extent and Aunpleteness of
the spy and traitor traps the depart
ment of justice has built up in this
country since war was declared was
revealed in the report for thé first
time. Gregory disclosed that hun
dreds of expert secret agents from
every other department of the govern
ment have been mobili^éd to meat the
situation.
The attorney ^neral paid high trib
ute to the "very effective work" of the
volunteer spy and traitor detecting or
ganizations that have sprung up ovhr
the country to help the government
wipe out that menace. He mentioned
especially the American Protective
league which he said had prov. n in
valuable.
SERVICES VOLUNTEERED.
"Its membership," said Gregory,
"which Is carefully guarded, Includes
leading men In various localities, v
have volunteered their service* In se
ourlng rny kind of information of
value tc the nation."
Gregor.» also highly commended the
local and district draft boards and the
drafted men, declaring the number of
defections from duty In all three
groups has been "very small."
RECOMMENDATIONS.
He recommended: Extension of the
statute of limitation on bankruptcy
cases to three years; appointment of
a priority federal /udge to do ths
work of judges over 70 who refuse to
resign because the constitution doesn't
compel them to if they behave them
selves; a law making extradition from
state to state unnecessary on federal
indictments; a law to prohibit common
carriers transporting materials mined
or made by themselves and authority
to sue any Interstate correspondent in
any federal district.
Completion of factories at Leaven
worth and Atlanta 'prisons, payment
of prisoners or their fnmilies for their
work and sale of all products to the
government was recommended.

Ottawa, Ont., Dec. 7.—Naval vessels
in the harbor of Halifax were not dam

munitions ship Mont Blanc according
to official messages received here to
day.
The naval college was In the danger
zone but only three of the cadets were
injured. The building was not de
stroyed.
is. It is less so in this instance than
would ordinarily be the case, because
Austria has been making war upon
this country for many months.
"Austria Is not only insulting our
flag and violating our territorial rights,
but she has been murdering our citi
zens. The people, passengers and
sailors on iliose ships which carried
the American flag and were sunk were
as much on American soil as they are
today and were as much entitled to
the protection of the American flag and
all the force and ppwer behind that
flag as we are."
VOTE AT 5 O'CLOCK.
The house continued to discuss the
war resolution, with prospecta of a
vote about 5 o'clock.
Preparations have been made to rush
the resolution to the president, If pos
sible.
Representative Meyer London, Social
ist. decried extension of America's
war as "a hindrance to the final com
mon understanding which will end the
wqg." This, will offset "the more or
less Inconsequential- military advan
tages to be gained by this resolution,"
he declared.
He appealed for a statement of com
mon war ulms from the 21 nations
fighting against Germany.
LA FOLLETTE EX PLAINS.
Senator La Follette this afternoon
explained to the senate why he did not
vote on the Austrian war resolution.
I have never dodged any responsi
bility by absenting myself when an im
portant roll call was to be taken," said
the Wisconsin pacifist. "As I listened
to the discussion I conceived an amend
ment which would perfect the resolu
tion. I left intending to return as soon
as I could draft the amendment. I
think the signal bell for the roll call
must have sounded while I was on my
way to my office, because I had no
idea that the resolution had passed
until my secretary had informed me
of It several minutes later.

provide that the United States assert

"In the name of the citizens of Mon
treal I offer you deep feelings of re
gret and sympathy. Will do my ut
most to assist the citizens of Halifax
In their misfortune," wired Mayor
Martin of Montreal. Deputy Mayor
Conwell of Halifax telegraphed for
building materials and bedding. This
message was sent to SO Canadian cit
ies.
Kitchener, Ont., wired that it had
appropriated »10,000 for Hallfux relief.
Thirty-five bodies have been found
in one section of a ruined hospital.
DEATH LIST AT DARTMOUTH.
Dartmouth's death list Is believed to
be between SO and 100. Members of
the citizens' committee, this afternoon
declared they believed the total of all
dead might be reduced to 1500.
Officers and crews of the two ships
which collided that caused the catas
trophe are being held for government
investigation.
That portion of Halifax that felt the
full force of the explosion is a wilder
ness today. The King Edward hotel
and the railway station are partially de
molished. But less substantial struc
tures are hurled together In a mass cf
splintered and charred timbers, broken
stone and fragments of glass.
HEART-BREAKING HUNT.
Weary survivors who have searched
the temporary morgues for missing
relatives went to hospitals to continue
the lieart-breaklng hunt.
Efforts of the citizens' committee
have already re-unlted several fami
lies.
All honor is due the hospital nurses,
who In spite of the severe shaking up
and the injuries received by some of
them, worked with never a let up as
the endless stream of injured came
pouring in.
They are still working.
FOOD SITUATION.
The food situation Is serious. Sup
plies are desperately needed. Arrival
of American relief trains is eagerly
awaited.
Halifax today looked like a town
that had been shelled for weeks. To
increase this war zone aappearance,
there were many Canadian soldiers
patrolling the streets and here and
there an American SRllor muffled up
to the eyes in his winter wrappings.
People who fled from the city after
the first shock returned today.

are needed to keep refugees from fall?

TEACHERS TELL THE
STORY OF DISASTER
St. John, N. B., Dec. 7.—First refu
gees from the Halifax disaster arrived
here today.
The party included Miss Catherine
White, and Miss Dorothy McKenzie,
both of Boston. The;- were in their
c1ç.rs room at St. Vincent academy
room a'
wfien the Mont Blanc blew up In the
harbor. .
The young women were uninjured.
Miss White said:
"When the explosion occurred we
were in our class room nnd all of a
sudden there came an awful noise. The
building shook like a leaf.
THE WINDOWS CRUMBLED.
"We thought some powder plant had
exploded. About a minute later the
full force of the explosion hit us and
every window in the building crumbled
to nothing but powder.
"Then came the awful screams and
agonized moans of the stricken.
"We were ordered to leave the build
ing." Miss White continued, "as the
sisters in charge thought a magazine
which was situated near us would ex
plode. We all hurried into the woods
in the rear of ouh school.
CITY MASS OF FLAMES.
"About noon we returned to the
academy. At that time the city was a
mass of flames. Men came to us and
begged for cloth bandages. We fran
tically tore up sheets and gave them
everything In the place which would
be of any use.
"By this time loads of dying and
injured were being brought to us In
wagons and our sisters began to assist
in dressing their wounds.
"Men broke down and sobbed and
women, shrieking snd moaning, were
soon clustered in our damaged but still
Intact buildings.
Many were horribly cut. Women
clasping babies to their breasts, begged
for help."
PASSENGERS AND THE
CREW OF LINER SAFE
New York, Dec. 7.—-Passengers and
crew of the huge liner Nthuw Amster
dam of Vh e Holland-American line are
safe, It whs stated at offices of the
■company here today. Some fears had
been expressed that she was in Hnlifa
harbor at the time of the Mont Blames
explosion.
AMERICAN OFFICER
ESTIMATES DEAD
AT FIVE THOUSAND
Washington. Dec. 7.—Five thousand
dead in the Halifax disaster was the
unofficial estimate a naval commander
forwarded to the navy department here
overnight.
He had seen and heard the Bprrtble
explosion while 52 mile* at sea and
reaching the harbor learned of the
holcaust. f
He declared the munitions ship crew
reached shore safely by abandonthg
their craft when the fire started.
The navy department announced the
following had been reoalved from a
commander:
"While BIT miles at sea, the explo
sion of a munitions ship was aeon and
heard. On arriving, assistance was of
fered the authorities and the follow
ing learned concerning the circum
stances leading up to the explosion.
Belgian relief ship oolllded with
a French munltiona vessel loaded with
three thousand tons of T. N. T. snd a
large quantity Of benzine. Due to an
explosion, the benzine caught fire and
as soon as the fire sorted ths ersw
abandoned ship, reaching shore before
the explosion took place.
"Practically all of North Halifax
was destroyed and all windows and
doors In Halifax and Dartmouth wars
demolished.
"Tonight It is believed that there are
6000 dead but these figures oannot he
confirmed.
"The explosion sank three sh(ps and
badly burned many others.
"The ruins of buildings are now
burning fiercely in north Halifax."
AMERICANS HELPING.
Secretary Daniels announoed that the
commander of an Amerloan warship
which arrived In Halifax following the
explosion had landed a guard to co
operate with the authorities In policing
the stricken district
Presumably It was the commander
who reported a rumor that 6000 were
killed.
FEAR FORSAFETY OF
AMERICAN CONSUL
Washington, Dec. 7.—-Fears for the
safety of American consul General
Ethelbert Watts of Halifax, a Phila
delphian, were voiced at the stats de
partment today. Consul Freeman of
Sydney. N. S.. left early today to in
vestigate the fate of Americans In the
vicinity of the explosion.
The American consulate at Halifax
is within two and a half blocks of the
water front and close to the custom
house.
Efforts were made all night to get
In touch with Halifax by state depart
ment cable, but the best that could be
done was to order Freemnn to go there.
The department's anxiety was
heightened by the fact that Watts is
always prompt to report such matters.
I Jr it father of Constructor Watts of
the navy and was American consul in
Brussels at the outbreak of the war.
That no American ships were in
volved In the Halifax disaster appeared
more likely this forenoon from the fact
that no mention of any was Included In
the navy department's report*.
SURGICAL WORKERS
ARE OVERWHELMED
Ottawa, Ont., Dec. 7.—Reports from
Halifax today declared that surgical
workers there were overwhcTmed
There are not enough doctors and
nurses to handle the unnumbered
throngs of maimed. More help is en
route and Is eagerly awaited. x
Some of the surgeons on the ground
were themselves injured by the ex
plosion but have been working without
rest for more than 24 hours.
Scenes In first aid dressing stations
in the war were outdone by the spec
tacle in Halifax when men, women and
children, suffering from terrible in
juries, some scorched black but still
alive, were carried,to the surgeons.
Heavy damage was done to Can
adian military barracks and a number
of soldiers were killed. The military
hospitals were the first to be pressed
into service.
The congestion of wounded in Hali
fax will be relieved by taking some of
ths injured to other towns. Some may
be removed by boat
THOUGHT GERMANS
HAD COME IN AIR
Truro, N. S., Dee. 7.—There were
cries of '"aeroplane raid" In Halifax
when the explosion caused by collision
between a French munition ship and a
Belgian relief ship, spread death and
destruction over the city. Refugees
arriving here today declared many be
lieved Germans were attacking the
Canadian naval base.
Tlioy declared that wires working
into the city were burdened with hys
terical messages addressed to friends
and relatives In Halifax.
Some of the buildings which had
been hastily prepared to receive bodies
were used as hospital*. The dead were
placed In parks and vacant spaces.
Scores searched these fields of corpses
for missing friends and relatives.
They stepped over the bodies, peer
