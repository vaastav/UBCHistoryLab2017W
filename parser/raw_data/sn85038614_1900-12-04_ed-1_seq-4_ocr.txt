The President's message to Congress is
. a, long. one. "tVe find, in it nothing: very
Stunning; nor, indeed,/ anything- very
striking/ He "may."" be pardoned " for r its
length because he had a gTeat number, of
' subjects "with which.' to deal. L.HeVi writes
in a calm and self-satisfied stjie. Hav

: 'seems to be in a good humor. : He, "of

upon the Federal courts, jurisdiction in

I :Oscar.l*.'; Boov a resident of Brlstol;Pa^
is; dyiiig/of injuries^ which, it : is 'alleged,
received; as; the: result ;of 'a; hazing at
the United States Military Academy. The
young man is now 22 years' of age, and
has -not been a cadets 'at .'West Point for
several month'sj-, -When ' he 'entered the
'■institution'- his fellow students soon sized
him up as a ' 'chicken-hearted* ' youth, and
therefore /subjected him : to "a course .■ of
.treatment..: designed,- ; as they [said, *" to
."makes a man of him." .One night Booz
was taken' from his; room,' and stripped.
Ice water was first poured 'down his back
and then he was. ordered to; swallow sev r
eral- tablets of . cayenne pepper, /; TJpoir re
fusing ;to take the .pepper; -lie- was
again drenched : with ice -water, and, at
the point of. a red hot poker,- he was fore-,
ed to swallow A the - tablets. r This 'cruel
treatment^ injured his ' throat) and for
.months he - could swallow nothing;-', but .
liquid food/- Later on' Iris- condition be
came; so : discouragini that - he was •com
pelled to resign his ■ cadetship and return
home.;. - " . "i '-■;. ■ '' -. /-. -; ..
Until the young man's condition had be
come • hopeless, he; manfully withheld
fronv his parents the cause of his illness. ■:
The details of thiscase are so horrible
that justice to all persons concerned re
quires a -thorough investigation 'of Booz's
statements. ; If what : the sufferer ".. says
be.t rue; the offenders. should undergo the
severest punishment. " ; On the other hand;
if the charges berfalse : or "'■ erroneous; the
Military Academy - should =be freed from
the odium, which, necessarily •; attaches to
