Death of Roland Reed's Wife:
New Y'ork, Dec. 8. The talk in fom-
initio theatrical circles yesterday was
the shockingly sudden death of Alice
Hastings, the wifo of Holand Reed,
Saturday morning. With tlioir mourn
ing for her there was mixed no small
measure of sympathetic astonishment
over the proposed killing of Mrs. Itecil'i
iavoritepot dog. Chic, In order that ho
might be buried with his mistress at
the Odd Fellows' Cemetery in Phila
delphia on Tuesday. Mr. Heed had
made the announcement of his Inten
tion on Saturday, aud tho theatres
were rife with discussion of tho dra
matic event.
REENVILLE
WASHINGTON COUNTY.
THE PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE.
The leading feature of tho annual
message of the President is devoted to
the question which the Democratic
party made the issue of the recent
campaign. It reads, to us, as over-
tinged with the adverse response of
the people to the questiou ; conveying
the impression that their negative on
the Democratic propositions, reflects
heresies of Government dangerous
to the stability of the nation. While
the public may properly be warned of
the tendencies of the period which Mr.
Cleveland portrays, we have no doubt
that when the real danger liue is im
minent, the Amcricau people will as
heretofore be equal to the emergency.
That the "farmers and workingmeu''
did not respond to the recent appeal
warrants no assumption that they will
not if the aggressions aud abuses pro
gress uhchecbed. The picture is over
shaded. Vast aggregations of wealth
and the banding of corporations for
persoual cuds are not unmixed evils.
Those are iucident to the progress of
a wondrous age ; aud the power of a
mighty nation. The forces of their
creation are to bo held iu chock and
control ; but not execrated by contrast
with the "good old days' or uprooted
for the evil that is in the furturo.
The portiou of tho message to which
we refer should be read by all ; and
as far as our space permits is here
published :
To the Congess of the United States.
As you assemble for the discha rgc
of the duties you have assumed as tho
representative of a free and generous
peoplo, your meeting is marked by au
interesting nnd impressive iiichicut.
With the expiration of the prescut ses
sion of the Congress, the first century
of our cousitutioual existence as a na
tion will be completed.
Our survival for 100 vcars Is not
sufficient to assure us that we no longer
have dangers to fear in the maintenance
with all its promised blessings of a
Govornmcut founded upon tho freedom
of the people. The same rather ad
monishes us to soberly enquiro wheth
er in the past we havo always closely
kept in the course of safety and wheth
er we have before us a way plain and
clear which leads to happiness and
prosperity. Tho citizen of our repub
lic iu its early days rigidly insisted
upon full compliance with tho letter of
this bond, aud saw stretching out bo
fore him a clear Hold for ludividunl en
deavor. His tribute to- the support of
bis government was measured by the
cast of its economical maintenance, and
he was secure iu the enjoyment of tho
remaining recompense if he w as steady
and contented. As it was in thoss
days, the frugality of tho people was
stamped upon their government, and
was enforced by the tree, thought'ul
and intelligent sutl'rago of the citizens.
Combinations, monopolies ami aggre
gations of capital wero either avoided
or stonily resisted and restrained. The
pomp aud glittor of governments less
free offered uo temptation and present
ed no delusion to the plain people; who,
side by side, In friendly competition,
wrought for the ennoblement nnd dig
nity of man, for tho solution of the
problem of frco government, and
for the achievement of tho grand des
tiny awaiting the laud which God had
given them. A century has passed ;
our cities are tho abiding places of
wealth and lurury ; our manufactories
yield fortunes never dreamed of by tho
fathers of the Republic. Our business
men are madly striving in tho race for
tiches, and immense aggregations of
capital outrun tho imagination in the
magnitude of their undertakings.
Wo view with pride and satisfaction
the bright picture of our country's
growth and prosperity, whllo only a
closer scrutiny develops a somber
shading. Upon more careful inspec
tion wo find the wealth aud luxury of
our cities mingled with poverty and
wretchedness and uurcinimcrative to
it. A crowded aud constantly Increas
ing urban population suggests the im
poverishment of rural sections and dis
content with agricultural pursuits; the
farmer's sou, nut satisfied with his
father's simple and laborious life, joins
the eager chase for easily arquired
wealth.
We discover that the fortunes real
ized by our manufacturers arc 110
longer solely tho reward of steady In
dustry aud enlightened foresight, but
that they result from the discriminat
ing favor of the government, nud are
largely built upon under exactions
from the masses of our people. Tho
gulf between employer and the em
ployed is constantly widening and
classes are rapidly forming, olio com
prising the very rich ami powerful,
while iu another are found tho toiling
poor.
As we view the achievements of
aggregated capital, we discover the ex
istence of trusts and combinations and
monopolies, while the citizen is strug
gling lar in tho rear, and trampled to
death beneath an Irou heel. Corpora
tious, which should bo tho carefully
restrained creatures of the law and the
servants of tho people, arc fast becom
ing the people's masters. Still, con
gratulating ourselves upon tho wealth
and prosperity ol our country, and
complacently coutetnplnting every in
cident of change inseparable from
these conditions, it is our duty, as
patriotic citizens, to inquire at the
present stage of our progress how the
bond of the government, made with
tho people, has been kept and per
formed. Instead of limiting the trib
ute drawn from our citizens to the
necessities ol its economical adminis
tration, the government persists in ex
acting from tho substance of the people
of millions which, unnpplied and use
less, lie dormant in its treasury. This
flagrant injustice and this breach of
faith and obligation add to tho extor
tion and danger attending the diversion
of the currency of the country from
the legitimate channels of the business.
Under the same laws by which these
results are produced the government
permits many millions more to he ad
ded to the cost of tlio living of our
people and to be taken from our con
sumers, w hich unreasonably swell the
profits of a small but powerful mi
nority. The people must still be taxed
for the support of the government
under the operation of tarilf law, but
to the extent that tho mass of our citi
zens are Inordinately burdened beyond
any useful public purpose, aud for the

benefit of a favored few, the govern
meut, under pretext of au etervise of
its taxing power, enters gratuitously
iuto partnership with these favorites
to their advantage aud to the injury ol
a vat majoritv of our people. This
is not equality before the law.
Ihe existing situation is injurious
to the health of our body politic. It
stifles iu those for whose benefit it is
permitted all patriotic love of country
aud substitutes iu its place selfish
greed and grasping avarice. Devotion
to Amcricau citizenship for its ow u
sake aud for w hat it should accom
plish as a motive to our nation', ad
vance ncut aud the happiness of all our
people is displaced by the assumption
that the government, instead of being
ttie embodiment of equality, is out au
instrumentality ttirougu which espe
cial aud individual advantages are to
be given.
The arrogauce of this assumption
appears iu the sordid disregard of all
but persoual interests, iu the refusal to
abate for the beuetit of others one iota
for selfish advantages through efforts
to control legislation and to improper
ly influence tno suffrages of the people.
The grievances or those not included
w ilhiu tho circle of these beueticitries,
when fully realized, w ill surely arouse
irritation and discontent. Farmers,
loug sull'ei'iug aud patient, struggling
iu the race of life w ith their hardest
and mest unremitting toil, will uot
fail to see, in spite of misrepresenta
tions anil misleading fallacies, that
they are obliged to accept such prices
tor their products as are fixed iu the
foreign markets where they compete
wiili the farmers of the world; that
their farms are declining iu value
while their debts increase, and that
without compensating favor they arc
forced by tho action of the govern
ment to pay for the benefit of others
such cuhauced prices for the things
they need that tlio scanty returns of
their labor fail to furnish them support
or leave no margin for accumulation.
Our workingmeu, enfranchised from
all delusions, aud no longer frightened
by tho cry that their wages are emlatr
gcred by a just revision of our tarilf
laws, will reasonably demand through
such revision steadier employment,
cheaper means of living in their homos
freedom for themselves and their child
ren from tho doom ef perpetual servi
tude, sod au open door to their ad
vancement beyond tho limits of the
laboring class. Others of our citizens
whoso comforts aud expenditures are
measured by moderate salaries and
fixed incomes will Insist upon the fair
ness and justice of cheapening tho cost
of necessities for themselves and their
families. When to tho selfishness o-
thc beneficiaries of unjust discrimiuaf
Hon under our laws, there shall be
added tho discontent of those who
stiller from such discrimination, wo
will realize the fact that tho beneficent
purposes of our government, depend
cut upon the patriotism and content
ment of our people, aro endangered.
Communism is a hateful thing and
a menace to peace and organized gov
ernment, but tho communism of or
ganized wealth and capital, tho out
growth of ovcr-wcaiiiug cupidity and
selfishness which insidiously under
mines tho justice and integrity offreo
institutions is uot less dangerous than
tho communism of oppressed poverty
and toil, which, exasperated by Injus
tice and discontent, attacks with wild
disorder tho citadel of rule, lie
mocks tho peoplo who proposes that
the government shall protect tlio rich,
and that they Iu turn will caro for
tho laboring poor. Any Intermediary
between tho peoplo and their govern
ment, or tho least delegation of tho
caro and tho protection tho govern
ment owes to tho humblest citizen in
the land, makes tho boast of froc Institu
tions a glittering delusion and tho pre
tended boon of American citizenship
a shameless Imposition.
Gratuities iu tho form of pensions,
are granted upon no other real ground
than tho needy condition of tho appli
cant, or for reasons less valid; aud
largo sums aro expended for public
buildings and other Improvements
tipou representations scarcely claimed
to bo related to the publio needs and
necessities. Tho extent to which tho
consideration of such matters subordi
duto and postpone action upon subjects
of great public importance, but In
volving 110 special, private or partisan
interest, should arrest attention and
lead to reformation.
A few illustrations of this condition
may bo slated. Tho crowded condi
tion of the calendar of tho supreme
court and tlio delay to suitors and de
nial of justice resulting therefrom, has
been urged upon the attention of
congress, w ith a plun for tho relief of
tho situation approved by those well
ablo to judgo on its merits. While
this subject remains without effective
consideration, many laws havo beeu
passed providing lor the holding of
terms of inferior courts at places to
suit the convenience, of localities, or to
lay the foundation of an application
for the erection of a new public build
ing. Itopcatcd recommendations have
been submitted for the amendment and
changes of tho laws relating to our
public lands, so that their spoliation
and diversion to other uses than as
homes for honest settlers might be
prevented. While a measuie to meet
tills conceded necessity of reform re
mains awaiting tho action of congress,
many claims to these public IbhiIs and
application for their donation In favor
of states aud individuals have been al
lowed A plan ill aid of Indian man
agement, recommended by thoso well
in formed as containing valuable fea
tures in furtherance of the solution of
the Indian problem has thus far failed
of legislative sanction, while grants of
doubtful expediency to railroad cor
porations, permitting thorn to pasB
through Indian reservations, havo
greatly multiplied.
The propriety and necessity lor the
erection of one or more prisons for the
confinement of tho United States con
victs, and a post office building at the
national capital are not disputed. Hut
these needs yet remain unanswered,
while scores of public buildings hove
been erected where their necessity for
public purposes is not apparent.
A revision of our pension laws
could easily bo made which would rest
upon just principles and provido for
every worthy applicant, lint wiuia
our general pension laws remain con
fused aud imperfect, hundreds of our
private, pension laws arc annually
passed which are the sources of unjust
discrimination aud popular demorali
zation. Appropriation bills for the support
of the government aro defaeed by
items and provisions to meet private
Times,
euds, and it is freely asserted byre -
sponsible aud experienced parties that
a bill appropriating money f.ir public
iutcrnal improvements would fail to
meet wih favor unless it contained
more local and private advantage than
public benefit. Statements can be
much emphasised by au ascertaiumcut
of the proportion of federal legisla
tion which either bears upon its tare
its private character, or which upon
examination develops such a motive
power. And yet the people w ant ami
expect from their chosen representa
tive such patriotic actum as w ill ad

auswered by the performance of pub
lic duty with unselfish purpose. Our
missiou among the nations of the earth,

work God has given the American
peoplo to do, require of those entrust

our laws perfect devotion above all
other things to the public good.

Ail Incident officii. Sheridan's visit
to Europe during tho Franco-Prussian
war, remarks the Now York Sun, is
perhaps omitted from his article In tlio
November Scribiicr's through Ignor
aucoof tho facts. When the General
reached llcrliii he asked tho American
minister to recommend to him some
young American who could speak Ger
man fluently to act as au interpreter.
The minister recommended Mr. Charles
K. MacEean, better known to New
Yorkers as a police commissioner than
as an interpreter, and ho followed Gen,
Sheridan through tho campaign. Tho
General relates In Scribnor's how llis
marek and Napoleon sat on rudo
wooden chairs iu front of a cottago
near Sedan, discussing the situation,
and there is a picture showing tho two
men, ono triumphant, tho other down
cast, in tlio peasant's garden. A few
days Inter Gen. Sheridan dined with
Hismarck, who began to tulk of the
surrender. "That meeting,'' said tlio
Prussian Chancellor, " will be his
torical. I sent over yesterday and
bought those two chairs from the peas
ant for'tcn francs apieco. Now I have
them as mementoes and I suppose,''
he added with a laugh, " the English
will go on buying thoso chairs for
years to couio."' Tbero was a general
laugh at this remark, but 010 oltlccr
had more to laugh at than the others,
aud gave his reasons to Mr. MacEeaii
aftcrwnrd. " You see," ho said, " I
know as well as Hismarck that tlio
meeting would bo historical, so the
very ucxl day I rodo over myself and
got tho chairs for live francs for the
pair.''
Au old colored man named Elijah
Eneas walked into E. Salmon & Co.'s
store nt Hays Landing tho other day
and remarked that he had just cat his
breakfast. A gentleman standing by
heard the remark and turned to Eoui
Salmon nnd offered him 50 cents If he
would give Eucas all ho could eat. The
proposition was eagerly accepted,
when tho old man began to eat. He
started on sardines and 9 boxes were
soon disposed of, a 1 pound can of
oysters followed, then 1 largo goblet of
jelly, 1 pound of crackers, 6 oranges, 1
bottle Worcestershire sauce and wound
up by drinking a half gallon of water
and disposing of one-half pound of
cheese. Considering tho fact that he
had just finished eating breakfast, w c
think tho old man did some pretty tall
eating.
