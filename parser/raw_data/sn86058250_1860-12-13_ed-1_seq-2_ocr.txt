We publish ia another part of ur paper,
a brief " report of a peech made by Hon.
0. P. Morton, in Indianapolis a few creuings
since. We endorse it as sound Republican
gospel as the truth of oar Republican fath
ers. It is a manly, noble vindication of the
principles upon which our government was
based and which must be maintained, if our
free institutions are to be perpetuated through
cctning time. We ask for it the candid pe
roral and examination of ery reader.
without regard to political or party predi
.1
ctions. It is tbe American piauoru., .
which every consistent friend of freedom
must stand, whether he a "native to the
maner born," or ha sought our country from
foreign lands, as the home of freedom and
equality.
The doctrine and sentiments in it enun
ciated are the tame we have ever advocated,
and which we now believe will be acted up
on in the forth-coming administration. As
inch we commend it to every reader. It
contains nothing new, but is the same old
truths we have so often heard before, but
which have seldom been proclaimed in
plainer or mora forcible language.

my oi our government e u' u
patience to review that which we have al- (
ready published. It carries with it its own :
refutation. It exposes to the most casual
reader its inconsistencies and sophistry.
The most indifferent observer of the past
history of the slavery agitation, willdiscov-,
cr its falsehoods and false denunciations. '
While he boasts that in every case where
an effort has been made to reclaim a fugiiive,
where the power of the government has
been exercised, has been successful, he calls
upon the free Slates to repeal their laws
which are said to interfere with the reclaim
ation of fugitives from service. We are
willing for the sake of peace that Congress
shall give the South a fugitive slave law, '
which shall place the slave upon an rqual
footing with other property; but we are op
posed to the present law, because it is un-,
equal. Under its provisions a colored per- .
son may be arrested, taken before a com
missioner, who is paid a large fee for conv ic
ting tiiin ot alavery. a. -very nvegi aum if
he acquits him. This commiss-ior.er fixes
his own rules of court, and his decision is
final. There is no jury to investigate the
facts no appeal to another coutt no writ
of ttuhcat corpus, whereby another tribunal

thus being enabled to defend himself at ev
ery point. But a negro, or the man charg
ed with being a negro, though he may have
been born of free parents and never having
been in a slave State in his life, is subject
to be cariicd into slavery with less formality
and less means of securing justice, than a
dog may be reclaimed. The personal liber
ty bills of which Mr. Buchanan complains,
in their most objectionable features, are not
nail so oDnoxious to jjstice as is ibe fugitive '
slave law. We trust they will not be repeal- j
ed until tLe fugiiive slave- law is amended,!
and the threat of disunion withdrawn. f

Tkalrf y-Firet Congress.
Congress convened in its second session
of the 31st Congress, on Monday last. The
committees of the first session were contin
ued. On Tuesday the President's message was
read, and ordered to be printed.
On Wednesday, in the Senate Mr. Hale
moved to reconsider the vote to print the
President's message, and made a speech ex
posing the flagrant inconsistencies contain
ed in the message. Mr. I verso u said the
withdrawing States disclaim any further al
legiance. We intend to go out of the
Union before the 4tb of March next pea
ceably if we can, forcibly if we must.
Five States will go out and Louisiana and
Arkansas soon call conventions. Mr. Wig
fall said he thought the President would
precipitate the measure he intends to avoid.
Mr. Salisbury, of Delaware, said his State
having been the first to come into the Union
would be the last to leave it. In the House,
the Homestead BUI was taken up and passed
by 138 to 76.
In the House, so much of the President's
message as refers to secession, was referred
to a select committee of one from each State,
The Speaker appointed the following com
mittee: -
Thomas Corwin, of Ohio, Chairman.
Virginia, Millson; Massachusetts, Adams;
North Carolina, Winslow; New York, Hum
phrey; Sooth Carolina, Boyce; Pennsylva
nia, Campbell; Georgia, Love; Connecticut.

Phelps; Arkansas. Rust; Michigan, How-
ard; Florida. Hawkins; Ta Hamilton;
WiconMO. Washburne; Iowa. Curtis; Cali-
lornia. Burcb; Minnesota, Windon; Oregon,
Stout.
Mr. Hawkins, of Florida, asked to be ex-
cueed, but before the question was taken
the House adjourned until Monday. The
Monday. j
Mr. Irerson in the course of bis speech
in the Senate, referring to the refusal of the
Governor of Texas to call an extra session'
of the Legislature, said: And though there

lie sentiment is so 6trong that even her
Governor may be over-ridden; and if he
will not yield to that public sentiment, some
Texan Brutus may arise to rid his country
of this hoary-headed traitor. Great sensa
tion. He further said, referring to the probabil
ities of war: There will be no war. The
North, governed by such far-seeing states
men as the Senator from New York, Mr.
Seward, will see the futility of this.
He concluded as follows: War is inevita
ble; let the South take can ; kt the war
come, and we will meat the Senator from
New Hampshire, and all the myrmidons of

position to the Democracy of a I resident, ;
has brought about those results. How was
OUAl
it ia 1840?" Jeffersonian.
XW The "results" ol the recent elec
tion, are 6uuimed up by our neighbor to be:
the suspension of banks, olJ mercantile
houses breaking, and general distrust pro
duced everywhere ! and then comes the
crushing question: "How was it in 1840?"
Why, neighbor, you know it was pretty
much the same as now, for this reason: The
Democratic administration of Mr. Van Bu
ten, by its mismanagement, extravagance,
corruption, and rascality, brought the coun
try to the verge of bankruptcy and ruin,
just like the present Democratic adminis
tration of James Buchanan has done. The
action of the people in '40 and '60, bear as
striking a resemblance, as does the profliga
cy and misrule of the Van and Buck dy
nasties they hurled both from power and
place weighed them and found them
wanting. The similarity between the ac
tion of the democratic" papers of '40 and
'60, is also as like as two peas'-endeavoring
to throw the responsibility of their own par
ty's blundering, reckless and dishonest pol
icy, on the shoulders of their political op
ponents, with the full knowledge staring
their editois in their faces, that the Whig
administration of '40 was not in power more
t,)au ooe monthf and conse4.Uenily, could
"
no. ,ll)Ve br0Uiht a5out the bankruptcy
anJ ruin prevaiiir,g at Ulat per od . and that
RepuM;can administration of Mr. Lin
co,Uf has no, and Wl not bave he o
years, until trom and after the 4th of March
next. "How was it in 1840?" Why, Gen.
Harrison, fell a victim to "Democratic" as
lamination it is believed by many that he
was poisoned. God grant that Abraham
Lincoln and Hannibal Hamlin, may not
share the snme fate, in order that the lust
after power may be further perpetuated in
the bands of a party whose 'democratic' lea
ders stop at nothing, however meau or
monstrous, to gain their ends!
