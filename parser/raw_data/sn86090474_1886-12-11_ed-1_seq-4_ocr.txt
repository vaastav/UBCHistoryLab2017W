The snowstorm of the last week
was the heaviest ever known in many
parts of the South. The snow fell
ten inches deep at Montgomery, and
twelve inches at Atlanta. Through
out East Tennessee it varied all the
wav between one and four feet. The
fall was over twenty inches at Knox
vale, and a great many roois were
crushed by the snow's weight. From
two to four inches is a prety good
snow for this country, but when it
gets to that many feet, we begin to
feel like old winter is encroachin
too far upon the domains of the Sunny
South. In this immediate section it
did not come up to the big snow of

did it remain on the ground near so
long.
A cokkksi'on pent has a communi
cation in tins issue calling on our
Jeneral Assembly to protect the farm
ers against dogs and crows. We had
a dog law once, and the farmers, the
very men it was meant to protect,
raised more hades over it' than any
body else, and the Supreme Court
was prevailed upon to declare it un
constitutional. Many of the North
ern States have a very wise law tax
ing dosrs. and out of the funds tints
raised all sheep destroyed by dogs
are paid for, and at the end ol cer
tain periods any surplus which may
remain from this fund is applied to
t he public school fund. Why should
We can have such alaw;if the farmers
will unite in demanding it. But if a
tax was put upon dogs in Tennessee,
the farmers who keep the worthless
dogs would be the first ones to howl
over it. 1 he majority of the men
who keep really valuable dogs would
not object to paying a reasonable tax
upon them. As to the idea advanced
iy our correspondent ol putting a
royalty upon crow scalps, we believe
that would be too much protection
for protection s sake. We suggest
i hat the farmers kill the crows and
ourv ihem in their fieldsthey will
prove valuable in tin way a fertili-
zers. It is said that by soaking corn
in whiskey and putting it where the
crows can get it, they will get so
drunk they can easily be knocked
over with sticks. This would be a
good way to dispose of aheap of mean
whiskey, and the farmers might at
the same time largely increase the
fertility of their lands. We have not
figured it out, however, to see wheth
er or not the whisky and corn would
cost more than the crows would
amount to.

II. Savage thinks we need a constitu
tional convention, and the McMinn-
viiie Standard thinks that "as there
will be no elections held next year, a
better time could not be found for the
discussion of the provisions of a new
constitution." The Standard also
thinks our next Legislature should
order the submission of the question
"convention" or "no convention" at
the next election. If the question
was not submitted until the next elec
tion we fail to see how the conven
tion could be held next year. Day
ton .wews-uazette, ;
isn't it a little peculiar how some
people will persist in looking at things
through cross-eyed spectacles? We
have never said a word about hold
ing a constitutional convention next
year. The forming of a new constitu
tion is a task which should be delib
erately and dispassionately discussed
by the press and people, and we still
claim that there will never come a
more opportune time for this discus
sion than next year. If the State
waits until the necessity for a new
constitution becomes so imperative as
to no longer admit of delay, there will
be danger of rushing one through
without proper, consideration, conse
quently we favor the wiser course of
beginning in time and doing every
thing decently and in order. Let the
General Assembly pass the prelimi
nary bill this winter by all means.
THE PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE.
The annual message of the Presi
dent to Congress was transmitted to
that body last Monday. The docu
ment as a whole is entirely too lengthy
for our columns, and even were we
able to publish it, only a small per
cent perhaps of our subscribers would
read it. We give below the portions
of the message of most general inter
est to our readers, and which we be
lieve will interest a large majority of
tho readers of the Standard :
A REDUCTION DEMANDED.
In my last annual message to tho
Congress, attention was directed to
the fact that the revenues of tho
Government exceeded its actual
needs, and it was suggested that legiS'
ative action should be taken to re
lieve the people ot the unnecessary
burden of taxation thus made appar
ent. In view of the subject, I deem
it my duty to again urge its consider
tion. The income of the Government
by its increased volume and through
economies in its collection is now
more than ever in excess of public
necessities. The application of the
surplus to the payment of such por
tion of the public debt as is now at
our option subject to extinguishment,
if continued at the rate which has
lately prevailed, would retire that
class of indebtedness within less than
one year from this date. Thus a con
tinuation of our present revenue sys
tern would soon result in the receipt
of an annual income much greater
than necessary to meet Government
expenses, with no indebtedness upon
which itcouldbeapplied. WeshouK
then be confronted with avast quanti
ty of money, the circulating medium
of the people, loaded in the Treasury
where it would be drawn into waste
ful public extravagance, with all the
corrupting national demoralization
which ioiiows in its train. Jjut it is
not the simple existence of this sur
plus and its threatened attendant
evils which furnish the strongest
argument against our present scale of
Federal taxation. Its worst phase is
the exaction of such a surplus through
a perversion of the relations between
tho people and their government and
a dangerous departure from the rules
which limit the right of Federal taxa
tion. Good government, and espec
ially the Government of which every
American citizen boasts, has for its
objects the protection of every person
within its care in the greatest liberty
consistent with the good order of so
ciety and his perfect security in the
enjoyment of his earnings, with the
least possible diminution for public
needs. When more of the people's
sustenance is exacted through the
form of taxation than is necessary to
meet the just obligations of the Gov
ernment and the expense, of its econo
mical administration, such exaction
lxH'oines ruthless extortion and a vio
lation of tho fundamental principle
of a free government. The indirect
manner in which lhee exactions are
made ha" a lemieiu-v to conceal their
true character and their extent, but
we have arrived at the stage of super
fluous revenue which has aroused the
people to a realization of the fact that
the amount raised professedly for the
support of the Government is paid by
them as absolutely, if added to the
price of the things which supply their
daily wants, as if it was paid at fixed
periods into the hands of tho tax
gatherer. Those who toil for daily
wages are beginning to understand
that cpaital, though sometimes vaunt
ing its importance and clamoring for
the protection and favor of the Govern
ment is dull and sluggish till, touched
by the magical . hand of labor, it
springs into activity, furnishing an
occasion for Federal taxation and
gaining the value which enables it to
bear its burden, and the laboring man
is thoughtfully inquiring whether in
these circumstances, and considering
the tribute he constantly pays into
the public treasury as he supplies his
daily wants, he receives a fair share
of advantage. There is also a suspi
cion aoroad that the surplus of our
revenues indicates abnormal and ex
ceptional business profits, which un
der the system which produces such
surplus, increase without correspond
ing benefit to the people at large, the
vast accumaiations of a few among
our citizens whose fortunes, rivaling
the wealth of the most favored in
anti-democratic nations, are not the
natural growth of a steady, plain and
industrious Republic. Our farmers
too, and those engaged directly and
indirectly in supplying the products
of agriculture, see that day by day,
and as often as the daily wants of
their households recur ihey are forced
to pay excessive and needless taxa
tion, while their products struggle in
foreign markets with the competition
of nations, which by allowing a freer
exchange of productions than we per
mit enables their people to sell for
prices which distress the American
farmer.
REDUCE THE TARIFF.
As every patriotic citizen rejoices
in the constantly increasing pride of
our people in American citizenship
and in the glory of our nationa
achievements and progress, a sentl
ment prevails that the leading string'
ents, useful to a nation in Its infancy
may well, to a great extent, be dis
carded in the present stage of Amerl
can courage and fearless self-reliance,
And for the privilege of indulging
this sentiment with true American
enthusiasm, our citizens are quite
willing to forego an idle surplus in
the public treasury, and all the peo
ple know that the average rate of
Federal taxation upon imports is to
day , in time of peace, but little less,
while upon some articles of necessary
consumption it is actually more, than
was imposed by grievous burden
willingly borne at a time when the
Government needed millions to main
tain by war the safety and integrity
of the United States. It has been the
policy of the government to collect
the principal part of its revenues by
a tax upon imports, and no change i
this policy is desirable, but the pres
ent condition of affairs constrains our
people to demand that by a revision
of our revenue laws the receipts of
the Government shall be reduced to
tho necessary expense of its economi
cal administration, and this demand
should be recognized and obeyed by
the people's representatives in the
legislative branch of the Government
In readjusting the burdens of Fedcra
taxation a sound public policy re
quires that such ol our citizens as
have built up large and important in
dustries under present conditions.
should not be suddenly, and to their
injury, deprived of advantages to
which they have adapted their busi
ness, but if the public good requires
it, they should be content with such
consideration as shall deal fairly and
cautiously with their interests while
the just demand of the people for re
lief from needless taxation is honest
ly answered. A rcasonableand timely
submission to such a demand should
certainly be possible without disas
trous shock to any interest and a
cheerful concession sometimes averts
abrupt and heedless action, often the
outgrowth of impatience and delayed
justice. Due regard should be also
accorded in any proposed readjust
ment to the interest of American la
bor so far as they are involved. We
congratulate ourselves that there is
among us no laboring class fixed
within unyielding bonds and doomed
under all conditions to inexorable fate
of daily toil. We recognize in labor
a chief factor in the wealth of the lie
public, and we treat those who have
it in their keeping as eitRceus entitled
to the most careful regard and
thoughtful attention. This regard
and attention should lie awarded them
not only becau-e lalior is the capital
ol'oiir workingiiien, jntly entitled to
its share of Government favor, but for
le further and not less important
reason that the laboring man, sur-
ounded by his family in his humble
home as a consumer, is vitally inter
ested in all that cheapens the cost of
iving and enables hin to bring with
in his domettic circle additional com
forts and advantages. This relation
of the workingman to the revenue
aws of the country, and the manner
in which its palpable influences, the
question of wages should not be for
gotten in the justifiable prominence
given to the proper maintenance of
the supply and protection of well-paid
abor, and these Considerations sug
gest such an arrangement of Govern
ment revenues as shall reduce the ex
pense of living while it does not cur
tail the opportunity for work nor re
duce the compensation of American
abor and injuriously affects the con
dition and the dignified place it holds
in the estimation of our people. But
our farmers and agriculturists, those
who from, the soil produce the things
consumed by all are, perhaps, more
directly and plainly concerned than
any other of our citizens in a just and
careful system of Federal taxation.
Those actually engaged in and more
remotely connected with this kind of
work, number nearly one-half of our
population. jNone labor harder or
more continously than they. No en
actment limits their hours of toil and
no interposition of the Government
enhances, to any great extent, the
value of their product, and yet, for
many of the necessaries and comforts
of life, which the most scrupulous
economy enables them to bring into
their homes and for their implements
of husbandry they are obliged to pay
a price largely increased by an un
natural profit, which, by the action
of the Government, is given to the
moreiavored manufacturer. 1 rec
ommend that, keeping in view al
these considerations, the increasing
and unnecessary surplus of nationa
income annually accumulating be re
leased to the people by an amend
ment to our revenue laws, which
shall cheapen the price of the neces
sariesef life and give freer entrance
to sucli imported materials as by
American labor may be manufactur
ed into marketable commodities
Nothing can be accomplished, how'
ever, in the direction of this much
needed reform unless the subject is
approached in a patriotic spirit of de
votion to the interest of the entire
country, and with a willingness to
yield something for the public good
LABOR AND CAPITAL.
The relations of labor to capital and
of laboring men to their employers
are of the utmost concern to every
patriotic citizen. When these are
strained and distorted unjustifiable
claims are apt to be insisted upon by
botli interests, and in the controversy
whicli results the welfare of all and
the prosperity ot the country are
jeopardized. Any intervention of
the General Government within the
limits of its constitutional authority
to avert such a condition should be
willingly accorded. In a specia
message transmitted to the Congress
at its last session, I suggested the en
largement of our present Labor Bu
reau and adding to its present func
tions the power of arbitration incases
where the difference arises between
employer and employed. When
these differences reach such a stage as
to result in the interruption of com
merce between the States tho applica
tion of the remedy by the General
Government might be regarded as
entirely within its constitutional
powers ; and I think we might reason
ably hope that such arbitrators, if
carefully selected, and if entitled to
tho confidence of the parties to bo af
fected, would be voluntarily called to
the settlement of controversies of less
extent and not necessarily within the
domain of Federal regulation. I am
of tho opinion that this suggestion is
worthy the attention of Congress, but
after all has been done by the passage
of laws, either Federal or State, to re
lieve a situation full of solicitude,
much more remains to be aesomplish
ed by the reinstatement ami the
cultivation of a true American senti
ment which recognizes the equality
of American citizenship. This, in the
light of our traditions, and in loylty
to the spirit of our institutions, would
teach that a hearty co-operation on
the part of all interests is the surest
path to national greatness and the hap
piness of all our people. The capital
should, in recognition of the brother
hood of our citizenship and in a spirit
of American fairness, generously ac
cord to labor its just compensation
and consideration, and that content-
(Hi
labor is capital's best protection
and faithful ally, it would teach,
too, that diverse situation of our
people are inseparable from our civili
zation; that every citizen should, in
is sphere, be a contributer to the
gsneral good ; that capital does not
necessrrily tend to the oppression of
abor, and that violent disturbances .
and disorders alienate from the pro
moters true American sympathy and
iindly feelings.
THE AGRICULTURAL DEPARTMENT.
The Dcgartment of Agriculture,
representing tho oldest and largest of
our national industries, is subserving
well the purposes of its organization.
By the introduction of new' subjects
of farming enterprise and by opening
new sources of agricultural wealth,
and the dissemination of early infor
mation concerning production and
prices, it has contributed : largely to
the country's' prosperity. Through
this agency advanced thought and
investigation touching the subjects it
has in charge should, among other
things, be practically applied to the
home production at a low cost of arti
cles of food which are now imported
from abroad. Such an innovation
will neccasiirly, of course, in the be
ginning, be within the domain of in
telligent experiments, and the subject
in every stage should receive an
possible encouragement from the
Government. The interests of mil
lions of our citizens engaged in agri
culture are involved in an enlarge
ment and improvement of the results
of their labor, and a zealous regard for
their welfare should be a willing trib
ute to those whose productive returns
are a main source of our progress and
power.

A NAMELESS CASE.
My case has been a very curious one for
about thirteen years. At intervals of about
one week I weuld be attacked with spells
of severe and most excruciating pain, al
ways commencing in the region of my kid
neys. Tbe pain would then eo upwards and
afi'ect my body and head, and seemed to
penetrate my very eye-balls, creating the
most intense suffering, lasting about eight
hours each spell.
1 resorted to all kinds of medicine with
out benefit. Several doctors treated my
case, but none gave relief. I finally used
B. B. B. as an experiment, and to my utter
astonishment all pain and suffering vanished
after using three doses. To the present
time I have used three bottles, ' and not a
pain has ever returned. I do not know
what was the matter, neither could my
physician name the complaint. The B. B.
B. acted finely and powerfully upon my kid
neys; my appetite hns been splendid and
mv constitution built up rapidly.

I am 55. Droke down twelve Years ago,
and have not been able to work since. Have
lost pioper action of my hips and legs. For
five year scrofulous sores have appeared on
my scalp, and nose, and at same time ray
eyesight b'eguu to fail, and for three years
been comparatively blind. Ilave been
treated by eminent physicians of different
schools without a cure. I have taken five bot
tles of B. B. B. (made at Atlanta Ga.), and
all scrofulous sores are gradually healing.
Inflammation about my eyes has disappear
ed and there is some improvement in my
vision. Am very much benefited and re
lieved and begin to feel like a boy again
feel good. My strength and actively are
returning in my legs and hips. The B. B.
B. acts vigorously upon my kidneys, and
the great quantity of matter that has been
forced out through the skin is utterly in
credible, often so offensive in odor as to
produce nausea. I refer to all busines men
