WASHINGTON- Dec. 10 Secre
tary Garrison's first annual report to
the President, as head cf the War!
Department, makes no recommenda
tions for the generally expected re-
j arrangement of army posts to dlstrl-
aaute troops In mobile units. Th
Secretary says that other things of!
I immediate importance, "particuhir'y
an adequate supply of field artillery'
will postpone his recommendations to
congress, but In the meantime the
troops will be garrisoned In as prac
tical a manner for mobilization as Is
possible.
Mr. Garrison discusses the militia
at some length.
He says in part:
"Tho national importance of a re
serve system for the Organized Mil
itia can not be questioned. The min
imum strength at which militia or
ganizations are maintained in time
of peace will render necessary a great
and immediate Increase In a national
emergency, and this fact demands the
presence- of a sytiem of r&ferv eft from
which trained men mav be secured
for this Increase. ithout soma
such system, not only will su-h
increase be rendered exceedingly
difficult, but even when accom
plLshed the efficiency of the organ
izations will have been reduced to n
minimum by the introduction of an
untrained element dduble in number
the trained personnel.
"Proper organization as required by
th" law Is absolutely necessary If the
Organized Militia is to be counted on
as a dependable military Federal as
cet iii time of national need, and the
organizations existing as such In
name only vi'l be required to com
plete their component elements or
lose Federal recognition of their
chancter as such organizations.
'While there has been a small de
crease in officers and enlisted men In
tbe Organized 'Militia during the past
year, this decrease has occurred, in
great part, as the result of .elimina
tion of organization found hopelessly
deficient and is compensated for by
an increase In general efficiency It
is regretted that In target practice the
reports show but slight progress dur
ing tbe year. This fact is the more
serious as rifle practice Is recognized
the training of the Infantry scldler.
The present tendency to develop rifle
teams, composed mostly of commis
sioned officers, at the expense of tar
get practice for the enlisted man is
opposed to the Federal po'Icy in; this
matter and should be discontinued."
Discussing the army reserve the
Secretary says. 21,000 men enlisted
In the Army between November 1,
1912, and August 31. 1913. and of this
number 61 made application to be
furtoughed to the reserve at the ex
piration of three year's service, and
that on the date last named the re
serve consisted of S men.
"I found from a personal trip to
most of the Army posts and from
Interviewing as many of the ofQcera
and men as I could that the men wera
dissatisfied with the present enlist
ment contract It does "not seem
annt, wbil t discuss whether their
dissatisfactlon is well founded or not,,,Ishment ' " IntersUe , trade com-

f Judge Sawtelle Directs Verdict
of Acquittal on Charges of
Conspiring to Send Ammu

Evidence Submitted by Gov
ernment Failed to Prove
That Defendants Were
Guilty of Criminal Intent
PHOENIX, Dec 10- After ten
days of legal activities during which
the merits of the case were thorough.
"J-- tested, the Jury selected to hear
the evidence returned today a ver
dict acquitting the Phelps Ucdse
Mercantile Company, the Douglas
Haidware Company, h. Bronhy
and F. K Coles, .of the charge of coa
spiracy in transporting .arms and Jin
munition across the International bor
der into Mexico. The verdict was In
accordance witli the Instructions of
Judge Sawtellp, who told the Jury that
the Government had net sustained the
charges against, the defendants.
Thp complete failure of the charges ,
was accentuated hj the fact that de
fense was not called upon to present
its side of the case. When the gov
ernment rested at the close of jester
daj's sessipn, Judge Sawtelle an
nounced that he would take the mat
ter under advisement. As soon,-as
court opened this morning. he In

The leading attorneys of the Arlzo

tvreafter was tried on the merits of
the conspiracy charges The evidence
only showed that a sale of ammunl
t'on had been made to parties who

Mlaslco. It was shown that the Doug

munition to the same parties who had
