Proposed to Re-establish the
Grades of Vice Admiral
and Commodore in Service
WASHINGTON. Dec. 4.-Secretary "of
the -Navy Bonaparte, in his annual re
•port. made public to-day, recommends the
creation'of two vice admirals, of whom
the senior would under ordinary circum
stances command the Atlantic fleet and
tLe junior the tieet maintained in Asiatic
waters. He also suggests -that the num
ber cf rear admirals be reduced by two
and thai the rank of commodore be re
itiabiifhed, and that from twelve to six
teen captains be promoted io thlg grade.
The Secretary takes- a stand against
a reduction of the. retiring age. holding
views ,*p"mewhat in contrast to those ex
presse#' by. Dr. .Osier. Bcnapartt; says
tht officers probably reach their best by
Xoriy. out he Is of - the opinion that they

and the defects in the naval establish

The deplorable disaster to the United States
steamship ' Bennrncton. in July - last, revived
the ann^atfd discussion as to the merits of
Ujc act of l«r.<, generally known as the "Per

BILLS DRAWN
BY WILLIAMS
Many Measures Indicating
Drift of Democratic Policy
Introduced in the House
ATTACKS ON TARIFF
Mi nority Leader Proposes a
Twenty Per Cent Reduc
tion in Dirigley Schedules
WASHINGTON.' Dec. '4:— Representative
Williams of Mississippi, trie leader of the
minority In the House, to-day introduced
a number of bills and joint ; resolutions
affecting ihe tariff and campaign contri
butions. These contemplate free trade
with the, Philippines; a reassembling of
the United States and Canadian Joint
High .Commission,, with a . view to freer
trade relations between the United States
and Canada, and a tariff for
the United Sta tea. " The bill regarding
campaign contributions- forbids Federal
corporations chartered by' thoV Federal
Government and engaged in; interstate
commerce from making j such, contribu
tions.' These measures,- it is. believed, in
dicate the probable course of the minor
ity; on the subject, of the tariff envision
and reciDrocity and the question of con
tributions in. politicar* campaigns.
; WiUiams said to-day, that- other *, bills
may be looked for, -as he 'would- not be
satisfied .with : revision to " the extent in
dicated, but from bis standpoint ; it, was
merely the first step in the right direc
tion and an invitation .to the Republican
party to declare its intentions/
Williams introduced a bill to authorize
the Imposition of an income tax.': /
The Philippines tariff bill provides that
all articles the, product, and growth of
the Philippines shall be. admitted into the
United , States free of "import ! duty, r and
that all articles the product and growth
of the, balance of the United States shall
bo admitted into the "Philippines: free of
import, duty, and that nothing contained
in the bill shall be construed to "repeal
any provision of the Paris treaty between
the United States and Spain.- :;, • ; ;
Another bill proposes . to establish a
minimum tariff of- the United States. It
declares- the existing tariff- schedules tp
constitute the maximum- tariff r of^ the
United States and a reduction of 30^ per
cent from them, or* rates equal ' to four
fifths of the' existing duties, to" consti
tute the minimum \u25a0 tariff of the Uhitea
States.
Williams said 'he had " selected *20 per
cent "as the amount of reduction to be
made in order to constitute a minimum
tariff,. although he thought that the. re
duction should be greater than that,. out
of deference to Republican -opinions and
to give Republicans who are sincere. and
honest in their, desire to reduce the tariff
an opportunity to act, with the knowl
edge that they would meet with no fac
tious opposition."- bu^ with - the^ " hearty^
support -of the" Democrats.: a> ; •<!•.• ,Yr os ! ?
Another bill by Williams Is to^amjend
section. l 6 of . the Dingily, act. , s . lt forbids
any common carrier or iransportation
agency of any sort, ''including express"
companies, from transporting spirituous,
%inousPr malt Hauors Into* any State or.
rnuni'cipality where fhe'-gale of liquor is
forbidden, "when they are carried CO. D,
or in any manner So that, the- 'Carrier is
charged with the duty; of collecting-for
the same ordoing any other act-as agent
of the sejler necessary to complete or
perfect the sale. :^>\V.V

The fatal prize-fight on board a war
ship in the West Indies is alluiied to and
the recommendation made that closer, su
pervision be exercised over these con
tests hereafter by the" officers. Fighting
at the naval academy Is condemned,, and
the Secretary . says the practice must be
suppressed.- ' \u25a0 • . t:
MAXY SHIPS OBSOIiETC
An increase in the marine corps,and the,
upbuilding of the naval militia of the sev
eral States Is strongly advised. "...',
The repeal of the statute, requiring" the
transportation of supplies for the hayy;in
American bottoms' is recommended: : ..'. \u25a0
The- Secretary proposes' that a -new
ship be: added, to the navy to.be named
the Constitution," to perpetuate r the .'name
made famous . by ' the fighting frigate |of
the war'-of 1812J- In- this connection the
Secretary says the vessel now known. as
the Constitution in reality contains "but
few portions qf the original Bhip.
. The. department recommends the 'au
thorization of the following thirteen ad
dition* to the 'navy: .Two battleships,
$15,000,000; two : scout . cruisers, , $4,000,000;
four destroyers, $3,000,000;. two submarines
or submerslbles. $500,000;. .one gunboat of
the Helena type. $6O0,0QO:. two river gun-
boats. J200.000; total. $23,300,000/ V .' . \u25a0/ » :
, The Secretary ... suggests that the battle-
Vhipn be of 16,000 tons displacement, with
eight twelve-inch guntC This type is
thought to be more desirable r than that
'of 18,000 tons recommended" by the gen
eral .^bpard.' Another ' steel floating * dry
dock* is also recommended.- ; . -~..'\ •

1 WASHINGTON, , Dec. A—, The annual re- 1
port of \u25a0' Attorneys General [ Moody, \u25a0 which ]
j was given out to-day, is devoted I largely j
J to : 'a discussion of the anti-trust laws and]
I the -suits against corporations brought,- by ;
' the : Government. , The Attorney^ General
says; that the . railroads still disobey, the
law, despite | the best .efforts ; of \u25a0. the Gov
\u25a0 eVnment- agents. -He states: . -<: *. ',' " \u25a0•'
\u25a0 Offlctals'of railroads; have In jteneral terms

have declined to render- the .: only assistance ,
that -would be'df the :sJlißhteBt vaiue, namely. 1
the furnif.hlpj;"ot:evldence provlntf the onense. 1
To every case-- ot this" kind : there are two 1
guilty parties.- .The department- has been and
ts willing to accept the evidence either or -tne
shipper or of. the. railroad, official, giving him
the' immunity trpm \u25a0> prosecution ? which , would
reault-trom the»u»e^of th« -evidence, ; and to 1
proceed' by indictment | against i the other guilty |
party . But," lor reasons . which will be appre- 1
elated fey all; men have I thrunk- from betray
ing their confederate's. The cases,, therefore. In
which, evidence has been ;or will: be obtained
are occasional and exceptional, and | unless we
are content, to allow .the evil .. of.-. the • discrimi
natory practice .' by" common "carriers to con
tinue, with now and then the punishment of a
detected crime, - some »* remedy which - reaches
deeper than any law now upon the statute dook
must '-be' found.'.- -: - , >T 7 : '"' j \i.~
I The Interstate Commerce Commission and the
Department of Justice, by the qxerciFcof the
utmost diligence, can > discover and ...prohibit or
punish "o9ly a Bmall percentage of the .discrim
inatory, practice? - which actually exist. It;
seems- probable that the' direct. payment of re
bates in' irfoney has , largely diminished. It Is
alleged to be true, and. the evidence, before this
department^, so lar as it goes, tends to support
the allegation . that, though- elotheac and- dis
guised by various devices; the practice of giving
one shipper' preferential treatment over another,
Jir' like situation. In j substance, still continues.
If the power, upon complaint, to fix a future
maximum rate and put It Into effect' within a
reasonable tlrae, subject to appeal to the courtg,
should .be given to some ; administrative body
created by Congress, a weapon agalnst"dlscrlm-
Inatory Dracticis, much more potent" than any.
now available,-: would-be put Into the hands of
the .Government.- Upoa proof .- that a lower
rate had been given "to eoms preferred shipper,
the body clothed with, the power -to-fix a
future • maximum. -.rate : might r well . determine
that the . rate « which the . railroad could afford
to give to the preferred "shipper it could afford
to give to an shippers in VUe- situation.- • Such ;
a finding, it could- I>* predicted' with certainty,
the courts upon appeal would ; not . reverse, - for
jio \u25a0 better . evidence -of the legality, and justice
of the rate thus fixed could be found than In
'the action -of the carrier It6elf. \u25a0- It -would be
difficult for. the carrier' to maintain that a rate
