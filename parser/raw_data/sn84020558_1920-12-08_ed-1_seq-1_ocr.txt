Ills capture), was accidental. He was
crossing Fifth avenue at Forty-second
street, when Hugh J. Hannigan, for
merly a lieutenant in Willer's com
pany, recognized him. Hannigan called
a policeman and "WiHers was arrested.
At a police station the prisoner was
further identified by two other former
, lieutenants in Company I, Sidney P.
1 Howell and Francis Hatch. Willers
was then taken to Governor's Island
und placed in confinement at Fort Jay.
Willers, the police said, recited in a
brazen fashion how he was pent to the
United States as one of 300 cadets
trained in acts of espionage to enlist in
the American army.
On his arrival In the United States
Willers went to Albany, where he en
listed, he said, as a private. His mili
tary aptitude won his rapid promotion
and his knowledge of Knglish and his
ability to "speak like an American"
nabled him to obtain a commission.
Willers said he had never been sent
across the ocean and while in this
inuntrv his instructions were "to act
the part of a loyal American" and to
take no action until he reached the war
zene. " .
"What was your plan after reaching
the other side?" he was asKea.
"I could lead the company to slaugh
tha Dolice say he replied.
"You also would bo killed," be was
"What of that? Thousands of better

The police say Wilier remarked that
they would be surprised if they knew
"the number of officials at Washing
ton during the war who were employed
r.rmi nv as oie."
"Are they still there?" he was asked.
"That I don't know." he is said to
have answered. "But there were many
of them during the war."
The Forty-eighth infantry was etill
at Camp Sevier when the armistice
was signed and his usefulness sis a spy
at an end, Willers told the police he
decided to become a deserter and to
take they alleged, the company funds.
Tlie deserter then went to Chicago,

American woman named Crawford

WASHINGTON. Dec. 7 President
elect Harding concluded today his
two-days visit to Washington with an
other succession 'of conferences In
which he talked with his party asso
ciates about the league of nations.
the selection of a cabinet and other
problems confronting him in the build
ing of his administration.
The president-elect did not call on
President Wilson, but en route to the
station to board his special train lor
Marion. Ohio, he stopped at the White
House to leave his card and that of
Mrs. Harding. The automobile bear
ing the senator and his party drove
up to the north entrance to the exec
utive mansion, where it was met by
I. H. Hoover, chief usher at the"White
House. Mr. Harding presented the
cards, saying that he desired to leave
them "for the president," and then
I continued on to the station.
All of those with ,whom the presi
dent-elect conferred today preserved
silence regarding the details of the
discussions and Mr. Harding himself
said the conversations were strictly
of a confidential nature. He repeated
his statement of yesterday that he
was seeking by direct personal consul
tatlon to frame an administrative pol
icy behind which every one could
unite.
In his search tor information and
advice about the league, the president
fleet summoned Republican senators
jf the irreconcilable and of the mild
enervation groups alike, and it is un
derstood he told them he wanted sug
;,estions from every quarter. Wivh
ut submitting any conerete plan of
i.is own. he is said to have asked
plainly what sort of international
.igroement each of his conferees would
support.
The discussion of cabinet selections
had ;i wi'ler scope, several of his most
trusted friends undertaking to can
vass the situation' in separate con
ferences at various places throughout
the capitol. Harry M. Daugherty of
Ohio, who was his pre-convention
manager, was one of the most active
in this task, seeimt various members

Case Is Located
In Mexican Town
Republican A. P. Leased Wire
ARDMORE, Okla Dec. 7 The
search for Clara Barton Smith, want
ed here in connection with the fatal
shooting of Jake L. Hamon, million
aire and Republican national commit
teeman tonight apparently was near
ing an end for reports from border
towns indicated that the young woman
had been found in a Mexican village I
and had agreed to cross the line. 1
Sheriff Orndorff of El Paso. Tex,
and his chief deputy, Edward Bryant,
both reported that they had informa
tion that Miss Smith was in -a Mex
ican town Just across the border and
telegraphed Sheriff Buck Garrett ask
ing that an officer be sent for her.
Russell Brown, county attorney and
instigator of the Investigation which
led to the search for Miss Smith, said
he would confer with Sheriff Garrett
about sending someone.
Mr. Brown, however, was doubtful
as to- whether Miss Smith could be
brought back to the United States un
less she came of her own free will,
because of the fact that the United
States has not recognized the present
Mexican government.
Almost simultaneously a conference
was held in Fort Worth between at
torneys and Miss Smith's father The
lawyers, it was announced, advised
that Miss Smith surrender and also
said that they believed she would give
herself ud tomorrow. Tonight Mr
Smith left Fort Worth, It tyas believed
for El Paso, although no announce
ment was made. It was reported,
however, that arrangements had been
made for him to meet his daughter
and that he had completed arrange
ments for her return to this country.
, The Mexican angle to the case also
was brought in by dispatches from
San Antonio, which reported that a
letter addressed to Miss Claire Hamon
from Tamplco. Mexico, had been re
ceived there. Tho return address
read :
"H. O. Durkhardt. Apaito 408, Tam-
pico. Mexico."
Mr. Brown tonight placed little
credence in the reported interview of
a San Antonio reporter with Miss
Smith. He also announced that he
had telegraphed the district attorney
of Bexar county, Texas, aseking him
to take entire charsre of the inves
tigation of the interview. P. M. Ross,
the writer of the interview, was ques
tioned by San Antonio police today
and later released. lie said he was
prepared to make known Miss Smith's
whereabouts under, certain conditions.
Mrs. Jake L.. Hamon, widow of the
dead millionaire, in a statement made
at Fort Worth tonight declared that
"no such person as Clara Smith ever
existed," by that she said, the meant
that no such person existed so far as
the moral actions and shooting of her
husband were concerned.

ance of enough votes to pass the leg

Objections of senator ioage oi iia-

of Senator Glass. Democrat, of Vir
ginia, today blocked consideration of
the pending resolution directing re
vival of the war finance corporation
and the extension of more liberal cred
its to farmers by the reserve banking
system. The Republican leader said
time had not been given for senators
to study the proposition and sufrptested
that manufacturers of New England
were having the same difficulty as the
farmers in obtaining needed credit.
Senator Gronna said tonight that as
soon as the testimony taken in the
hearings by his committee was printed
and placed in the hands of the senate
he would press for consideration of the
resolution.
The resolution now is onthc senate
calendar and can be called up at any
time by unanimous consent or by ma

Its supporters sai dtonight that they
hoped to have it taken up and acted
upon during the morning hour, so as
not to conflict with the packer regu

just before his departure for. Paris to
night, informed the Associated t'ress
that Argentina's withdrawal from the
assembly probably would be followed
shortly by a formal declaration or us
intention to- leave the league.
"The only condition under which Ar
gentina will resume her place la the
adoption of hei four proposals in sub
stance," said Senor Pueyrredon. "Ar
gentine's notification of her desire to
quit the league entirely may be con
strued as dating from the day we left
the assembly and unless the assembly
acts favorably on my amendments. Ar
gentina will declare herself out ot the
league at the expiration of two years,
a provided in the covenant.
"I am more convinced than ever tnai
the course I have adopted is Just and
the only one possible under these cir
cumstances. I have haa many caDie-
crams congratulating me from Argen
tina and the president upholds me
am greatly encouraged by the speeches
by American congressmen in support
of my decision.
"The assembly will have to adopt the
four proposals I offered If the league
is to be made a world-wide instrument
to prevent war, such as Its originators
intended."
Senor Pueyrredon spent his last day
in Geneva saying good-by to his assist
ants and friends. He sent in his res
ignation as one of the vice-presidents
of the assembly and also as member of
several commissions. The two other

WASHINGTON. Dec. 7. Congras
sional consideration of methods to aid
in restoring normal business conditions
appeared in the offing tonight with the
announcement that majority members
of the ways and means committee
would meet tomorrow to discuss a leg
islative program with respect to com
merce and industry.
The enormous number of bills deal
ing with farming and industry, pre
sented yesterday and today, together
with an apparent desire of leaders to
do something for business generally,
made it appear certain that congres
sional attention would be turned to
business problems: once the appropria
tion bills are out of the way. Leaders
in the senate and house do not believe
that actual enactment of any such leg
islation can be accomplished during
the present brief session but they are
evidently agreed that the foundations
should be laid through committee con
sideration for prompt action after
March 4 next.
The ways and means committee will
have before it a wide range of pro
posals for tills already dropped in the
senate and house hoppers include
measures providing all the way from
far-reaching tax and tariff reforms and
agricultural relief to aid or give pro
tectlon to limited groups of industries.
home of the measures Kubm;tt-d
would direct congressional investiga
tion of unemployment. Among such
measures was a resolution presented
today by Representative Mason, re
publican, Illinois, calling for a series of
house committee investigations and a
conference of governors and federal
officials to ascertain facts and figures
and make recommendations. Mr. Ma
son's resolution set forth that there now
were more than 2.000,000 persons in
the United States in enforced idleness.
Permission to deduct income taxes
paid this year from next year's assess
able income was proposed as a business
relief measure by Representative Ac
kerman, republican. New Jersey, who
declared that the burden of taxes
should not be further increased by tax
ing money already paid or to be paid
Into the federal treasury.
Bills were offered in the senate in
large numbers today with the general
aim of stimulating business. The pro
gram of Senator Capper, republican
Kansas, for farm relief legislation
found expression in several measures
to regulate grain exchanges, while Sen
ator McCumber, republican, of North
uakota, introduced bills to prohibit the
importation for one year of grain and
grain products and live stock and other
food commodities, and the appointment
by the president of a commi. sion to
prepare for congress a general system
or co-operative marketing.
vo-operative marKeting also was
dealt with in the house bills. Means
of taking care of the surplus of creal
crops and at the same time assuring
the farmer of proper sale of uis prod
ucts was the stated object of a bill by
Representative Christopherson, repub
lican, of South Dakota, who proposed
to revive the United States grain cor
poration as the machinery to handle
the farm surplus.
All of the measures dealing with re
lief for farmers were designed, their
proponents declared, to aid the con
sumer as weil as the producer, but the
urban members were not overlooking
opportunities to render assistance by
legislation where possible to the busi
nesses of finance and manufacturing
through changes in the federal reser e
act and banking laws.

Both Galleries Crowded
With Spectators Expect
ing President to Read His
Message to Congress.
Republican A. P. Leased Wire
WASHINGTON, Dec 7 Both houses
of congress were in brief session today
to hear President Wilson's annual
message. It was read by the clerk,
Mr. Wilson having heeded the advice
of his physicians not to appear in per
son to present his recommendations.
Galleries in both senate and house
w ere crowded. Both these galleries
were drawn by the chance that the
president might appear in person or
by the possibility his message might
touch upon the league of nations ques
tion, or his own approaching retire
ment to private, life, but were disap
pointed Mr. Wilson confined himself almost
wholly to domestic questions. Only
by inference did his message refer to
the rearing close of his administra
tion and that was in concluding. The
proposals he presented, the president
wrote, were not so much a series of
recommendations as a confession "of
the faith in -which I was bred and
which it is my solemn purpose to etand
by until my last fighting day."
Aside, from hearing the president's
message, congress mad definite prog-t
less on at least on of the problems
it faces during the brief session. The
house received a rule under which an
effort will be made Thursday to take
up the immigration bill for prompt ac
tion. It would limit general debate to
four hours. The two days interval
was allowed to permit Representative
Siegel of New York, a member of the
Immigration committee to frame a mi
nority report.
Reading of Message Delayed
No matter in either house, had
passed today beyond the committee
Etage. At both ends of the capitol.
however, members were deep In plans
to deal with- business depression, un
employment and farmers relief. Dis
cussions in the senate of the plight of
tarmers delayed the reading of the
presidents message in that body
The industrial situation also found
a place in the president's message. Re
covery from war effects gave promise
of early completion "only in our fortu
nate country." Mr. Wilson said, and
even here "halts and is lmneded at
times." A program of "Immediately
serviceable acts of leci.-iation" to aid
that recovery and "prove the Inde
structible recuperative force of a
great government of the people"
should be undertaken, Mr. Wilson
said, adding:
"One of these is to prove that a
great democracy can keep house as
successfully and in as business-like
fashion as any other government."
Eirst among the recommended steps
Mr. Wilson placed enactment of a
"workable budget system." He said
he had vetoed the budeet bill passed
at the last session "reluctantly" and
because of "a constitutional objection."
but as it was later revised in the
house, he believed it would, with other
measures, furnish "foundations for a
national budget svstem."
Refer to Rail Expenses
Mr. Wilson cited figures as to the
national debt and urged "rigid econ
omy in which all branches of the gov
ernment should co-operate."
"I cannot over emphasize." he said,
"the necessity of economy In govern
ment appropriations and expenditures
and the avoidance by congress of prac
tices which take money from the
Treasury dv indefinite or revolving
fund appropriations
This year's estimates "strikingly il
lustrated" the importance of specific
appropriations, the president added,
the transportation act having "dis
turbed" the relationship between cur
rent receipts and expenditures to the
extent of over a billion dollars.
"It is obvious." the messaee con
tinued, "that these large payments
have already seriously limited the gov
ernments progress in retiring the
floating debt."
The president renewed some of the
recommendations he made at the open
ing of the last sf--for, n,Hi added:
Has Faith in S'-itesmanship
"I do not feel it my nriv'ere at pres
ent to siK-fresf the defiled and par-tv-iilar
methods by wh'ch these ob
ioots mav be attained, but I have faith
fiat the i'M.niries of your several
committer will discover the way and-
the method."
Tlie onlv recommendations for other
than domestic matters was that for a
Joan to Armenia to be administered
through American commissioners to
avrid "further terrrting opportuni
ties" to revyJmtion.iry tendencies in
that country, and for granting inde
pendence to the Philippines, "to keen
our tTomisc to the people of those
islands."
