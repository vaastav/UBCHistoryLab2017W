OUli PLATFORM.
Vnlterable opposition to the. policy of
Public Favoritism to Private Industries by
Tariff Taxation commonly colled the lie
publican Policy of Protection.
It looks very much at present as if
it would be Cleveland and Blaine
a "rain in 1S92.
Poor little insignificant nonenity,
Light Weight Kinsey. LNnvn deeper
than MeOintv.
In the late Congressional elections
the Democratic majority througliout
the land is about TOU.Ouo.
The Republicali papers seem to have
given up all hopes of securing a Re
publican successor to Senator Vest
next vear.
Defeated on the tariff issue the lie
publicans have gone back to their first
love and are busy waving the bloody
shirt and telling stories of the "late
unpleasantness."
Jno. Ii. Thomas is to-day recognized
as the best Circuit Judge in Missouri.
Before many years more roll round
see if the same can't be said of him
a3 a Supreme Judge.
With a Democratic majority of over
4.000 in Connecticut, the Republicans
still retain control of that Legislature
in that Sta'e. Oh no, it is only the
Democrats that gerrymander. The
Republicans never do anything of the
kind.
well known two years ago as they are
at present.
The election has evi l, nilv nansformed
some Deiuoer ts iu tbe First Congressional
IMstriet of Maine into sheer political luna
tics. They have actually been discussing
among themselves the que-tion of cont'-sting
the election of Speaker KeeJ to Congress
before the next Democratic l!ou;-e. Wiser
counsel." have finally prevailed, however,
and it is now gravely announced that the
preposterous project has been given up.
Cape Girardeau Democrat.
And why, Bro. Democrat, shouldn't
Mr. Reed be given a d'se of his own
medicine? Democrats have been un
seated by the pre ent Republican
majority in Congress without any re
tard to decencv or justice and Reed
sanct oned and assisted in the work.
One Democrat from Alabama having
a majority of over 13,000 was d splaced
to make way for a Republican. hy
then, we ask, shouldn't Reed be made
to feel the "rights of the majority?"
If the Southeast Missouri Teacher's
Association asnires to an v dignity, we
a. - - -
would advise its officials to take their
printing to a printing office, rather
than a blacksmith shop. We make
this suggestion on receipt of a pro
gramme of the next meeting just received.
The Register has nothing to say
against J. F. Green, of Hillsboro. He
is a young man of education and abili
ty and would doubtless make an excel
lent judge. It does seem tons, though,
that the north end of the circuit has
had the honors long enough and we,
of the south, are entitled to represen
tation. The appointment of Judge Thomas
to the Supreme Bench has created a
vacancy in the office of Judge of this
circuit, and the contest for the posi
tion promises to be spirited. The
avowed candidates are C. D. Yancey,
of Piedmont, and J. F.Green, of Hills
boro, with a possibility of several dark
horses in the back ground. The Gov
ernor will, of course, make the ap
pointment some time in the course of
the next month.
The President's Message was deliv
ered to Congress Monday. It is a very
weak document, replete with the
merest clap trap, and reads more like
the editorials of a rural Republican
journal than an official paper of the
Chief Magistrate of theXation. Benny
reiterates his belief in a prohibitive
tariff and clamors for the passage of a
force bill. It is a Harrison produc
tion, out-and-out. We will publish it
in full next week.
The Republican papers gleefully at
tribute the late troubles in financial
circles throughout the country to the
recent Democratic victory, and say
that it is evident capital has little
faith in Democracy. Our Republican
brothers with so much regard for the
truth, do not explain though, why it
is, that England, which was to be so
greatly benefited by Democratic suc
cess, has sufTered more than any other
country in the recent panic.
Gov. Francis has exhibited high
qualities as Governor of our State.
He has not made a mistake in all that
lie has done or left undone. His ap
pointments have all been good, but
those last made Judges of the Su
preme Court are exceptionally good.
Indeed, the Governor's general wise
tact and prudence and the energetic
public spirit he always displays ,mark
him out as a fit leader of the progres
sive You nar Denioeraej" of our State,
and one who has before him a long
and successful career of public useful
ness in high position.
The November electi ns fully devel
oped the political strength of the great
Weston the "protective" policy forc
ed upon the country by a Republican
Congress. Should that party under
take to "hedge," it will be confronted
and denounced by the wealthy manu
facturers and iron kings of the New
England States, and their methods of
carrying Presidential and Congres
sional elections exposed. The Repub
lican party has long since sold out to
the combines and monopolies, that
they may be better able to control the
men in their employ and regulate
wages to suit their selfish purposes.
Senator Quay, chairman of the Na
tional Republican Committee, by re
sorting to the most unprincipled
methods ever known in a campaign,
won a victory for his party in 1SSS.
All his dirty work was approved by
Republicans little and big throughout
the country, and he was regarded as
one of the greatest of men . Two years
later with Mr. Quay still Chairman of
the National Committee the Republi
can party meets with reversals unpre
cedented in its history. The Repub
licans big and little now clamor for
Quay's removal and say he is an un
clean man. And yet Mr. Quay was
just as much of an embezzler and dis
reputable person generally in 1S8S as
he is now. and the facts were just as
Knocked silly by the late g. o. p
defeat, the organs are in a horrible
tangle. The Globe-Democrat has dis
carded MeKiulev, Reed, e c, as no
longer available Presidential material,
and is now veiling for "Blaine and
Reciprocity," as the only possible
saviors in 1S92 Blaine for President,
and Reciprocity as the platform. How
marked the contrast between the G.-D.
cditoral conclusions now and those of
ls84! On the 23d of May, that year,
it said:
Hlaiue cannot carry the full strength of the
lit publican party, to begin with, and his re
pul-ive rotten record will repel the hide
pendei t or detaelitd voters. He is an un
clean man, and 1 lie people will not have him.
To nominate him would be to court defeat.
He stands self-convicted of prostituting the
hiuh Trice- he h-.is held to build up a private
fiiitune, of cohabiting with corruption for
dishonest money. O, no! h:s rvord would
damn him.
If the '.iid issue is dead" if it "ought to
be dead" as our Democratic friends tells us,
why is it that only two Republican Congress
men were elected at the recent election iu
all those states iconimonly known as the
Southern states those states that were en
listed on the wrong side (as they now admit)
of that question? Those states elected 119
Democratic congressmen and ou!y two Re
publican congressmen. Does that look as if
thev had forgotten the old issue? The North
ern states gave at the last eketion 112 Demo
cratic congressmen and !2 Republican.
Which seems to have forgotteu the old issue?
Piedmont Sentinel.
Putting aside the assumption that
"the old issue" is not forgotten by men
who refuse to vote for Republican
candidates, we will endeavor to an
swer our brother in the fair spirit in
which he asks the above questions.
The bete noir of the Southern people
is negro rule, and all other questions
are subordinate to that. They have
passed through the ordeal once, and
have no desire to again experience it.
They would not be worthy to be call
ed white men or American citizens if
they were willing to put themselves
under the black yoke. Northern im
migrants who go South to honestly
better themselves soon learn to know
that negro rule means confiscation
and disorder, and therefore vote the
Democratic State and local tickets,
while in national affairs they still
call themselves Republicans. This
ordinarily exteuds to the Congression
al candidates, but this year it did not.
The Force Bill threatens the welfare
of the whole South, and menaces it
with a return to negro rule, and just
so long as the Republican party in
sists on keeping that menace before
them, the white people of the South,
regardless of politics, will stand to
gether in opposition. If Mr. Durham
were in Mississippi, or Louisiana, or
Arkansas, or South Carolina, earning
an honest livelihood, he too would be
with them.
A Hail s at the State Capitol.
Jefferson City, Dec. 1.
The appointment of Judge Macfar-
laue anil Judge Thomas to the supreme
bench by Gov. Francis seems to have
given general satisfaction, l tie new
jutlgfs will take their seat on the first
Monday in January next and will have
charge of the "criminal division" of
the ciurt. They held office for two
years and their successors will he
elected at the geueral election in 1S92.
The Republicans held a state con
vention in this city last summer and
Mr. Chaunc y I. Filiey, the director
general f that body, announced that
the party which be had in charge
would not make t-ff rt to carry tbe
state this year, reserving that task for
1S02; but that it would carry the bgis
l'tture. 1 lie result ot the ettoit is
known. Some one was lookingfor Mr
Fi ley a few days ago. The governor
had to appoint a committee to examine
the bi'oks at.d make settlement with
the auditor and treasurer, and he need
ed a Republican member of the house
t make the third man on the c in
tuitu e. It was very difficult to find
one whose name was sufficiently well
known as a Republican to assure the
public that the committee wi.b non
partisan. All the prominent Republi
cans who had offered themselves to
the people had been buried under a
Democratic avaianche and their re
mains couldn't even be gotten at. Fir
ally the governor secured a man from a
county that was rash enough to send a
Republican to the house i.nd the c tn-
niittee was thus made up This was
Mr. Weeks of Japer county, who with
Senator Nat Shelton of Schuyler, and
Representative Hughes of DeKalb
constitute the examining committee.
The Republicans of the next house
will be able, without auy trouble, to
sit around and take their meals off a
wash-tub. When Chauncey I. Filiey
makes another prediction he is likely
to bear the word "rats."
The appointment of Judge Thoma
to the supreme bench will cause an ap
pointment to tbe circuit judgeship at
present filled by that geutleman. It is
thought that there will be a lively con-.
test ntuoncr tbe lawyers in the 26th
circuit for the appointment. Mr. J F
Gre.n. of Jefferson county, and Mr. J
W. Emrson. of Iron county, are nam
el in connection with the pl ice.
Judge O. M. Spencer, of St. Joseph
has announced that he intend to re
simi the circuit iu leeshio which he
holdM and enter the practice of law
Ht;ain. He will resign about the 1st of
Januarv. The governor will have to
fill tliis vacaucy lso.
The electi hi of Judcre DeArmond t
congress will bring about another vh
carcv in a circuit Judgeship.
The supreme court wi 1 elect a clerk
in June next. Mr. Henry Ewh-g is the
present incumbent. He has made an
excellent official. It is understood
th t he will not he a candid te for r--
appointment ani the coite-t for bis
pine b'.s already beann. The sa'firv
is S3 000 a vear and the term .f .fi
is six years, i here are imw six or
seven candidates at work.
Candidates for positions in the legis
lature r actively t work also, the
mail of the new u ember bt-ing fi h fed
with applications. The- fallowing is

has at its dispositon, together with the

There will not be so nuny clerks
employed at this session as at the last,
tor the reason that the last was a revis
ing session ami the clerical assistance
demanded was very great. Bonid-'S.
the new legislature com ?s in wbh a
determination to retrench expendi
tures and will no doubt set a good ex

little help as i necetsary for the trans

'From an experience of over thirty
