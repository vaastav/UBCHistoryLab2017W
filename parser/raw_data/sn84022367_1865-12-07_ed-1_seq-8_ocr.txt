Editor Rutland llirald : The social con
dition of the Capitol dltl'ers from that of
northern cities. The population Is
drawn together from all parts of tho
country and from all countries In the
Civilized world. A large part of It con
sists of those who do not Intend to make
this city their home and who do not
feel the interest In" the social welfare
of the community which permanent res
idents would cherish. Many villages
In New ngland and some country
towns have large public libraries by
which all classes of the community are
Instructed, whilo hero, with a popula
tion of 100,000, there is no such institu
tion. In some of the departments there
is a library for the use of the clerks.
In tne Department of theluterior, there
is a very valuable library containing
well selected books, but the use of them
is limited to' Its own clerks. The libra
ry . of Congress is very large and valua
ble, but excepting the use of books in
the library-room, which is freely grant
ed to all readers, tho ue of it is re
stricted to Members of Congress. The
same Is true of a valuable library In
the Smithsonian. Here arc thousands
of clerks, many of them gentlemen of
culture,. o whom books are a necessity,
who have access to no public library
and. who are at a loss for employment
alter oilice hours are over. The diver
sity of the citizens and their temporary
residence in the city prevent that homo
genous character which is essential to
the improvement of society. Men must
feel aud think alike and possess traits
of character in common, before they
will unite their efforts for the common
welfare.
The best select schools iu the city
were established and taught by Catho
lics. They were early In the field, and
with that wisdom and forecast which
has always characterized the;n, they
turned their attention to the young, se
cured city lots and erected seminaries,
and as regards schools of a high order,
are far in the advance of Protestants.
There are free schools for white child
ren, and within a few years, graded
schools have been established and sev
eral costly school houses have been
erected. These schools are of a promis
ing character, but much remains to be
done to elevate : them to the standard
which we see at the North. While
slavery existed here, there was but little
done for the education of colored child
ren. The colored people were tax-payers
and thus assisted in defraying the
expenses of the public schools from
which their own children were exclud
ed. Private schools were taught, to
which such of them as could afford the
expense, sent their children. The
friends of the colored people have for
years tried to Induce the city govern
ment to pay over a portion of the
school money which is paid Into the
treasury by colored people, for the sup
port of colored schools, but the old pro
slavery spirit of the city fathers has
prevented. In view of the facts in this
case, Congress passed a law in 1864,
that this school money should be paid
over to the Trustees of colored schools
for the benefit of colored children. It
is a reproach to the city authorities
that they have hitherto persistently re
refused to do this, and thirty-flve thous
and, dollars Is fraudulently withheld
from them. It is expected that Congress
will require obedience to the law and
will not permit the pro-slavery men of
this District to keep the colored child
ren in ignorance.
' The city is very quiet on the Sabbath.
The , various, .religious denominations
have numerous churches which are well
attended on that day. Doubtless the
attendance is far less than it should be,
tor many persons go abroad for recrea
tion or spend the day indolently at
home. Some officials of the govern
ment always spend the day in their
offices. During the war, some of the
Bureaus of the War Department were
always open on the Sabbath and the
clerks required to be at their desk. As
a rule, however, the President and his
Cabinet, the Members of Congress aud
high olcerg of tho government, attend
ed church. President Lincoln was al
ways in his seat In a Presbyterian
church when the exigencies of public
affairs permitted. Public worship is
always attended In the Capitol during
the session and a large audience is usu
ally present there. The preacher is one
of the Chaplains of Congress, or some
clergyman from abroad ' who may be
visiting here. The Catholics are more
numerous than any other denomination,
and their members comprise, not merely
emigrants from Europe as is the fact at
toe Norths but many of the first Ameri
can families in the city.' Maryland,
iron which the District of Columbia
WM set oil, WAS first Bettled by a Catho
lic colony, and marj of their most dis
tinguished men, among whom were
Charles Caroll of Carolton and the late
Chief Justice Taney, were Catholics.
After this city became the seat of gov
ernment many families from Baltimore
and other parts of Maryland removed
here and Catholic, churches' were early
established. There is a large number of
Methodist and Baptist churches which
are well attended and where eloquent
and faithful pastors preach the gospel.
Here are several Episcopal churches,
one of which has a larger congregation
than any Protestant church in the city.
Old and New School Presbyterian
churches aro located In various parts of
the city, attracting large congregations
by the high character and faithful la
bors of their pastors. It will interest
many of yonr readers to know that
Congregational worship has been lately
established here under very favorable
auspices. A church has been formed
and a large congregation assembles
every Sabbath to enjoy the ministra
tions of their worthy and acceptable
pastor.
Let not your readers, however, im
agine that we are as orderly and virtu
ous a set of people as the religious priv
ileges would indicate. The criminal
court has just adjourned, after a session
of more than four months, to meet
again on the first week in December.
During its late session, more than five
hundred persons were Indicted for near-
lw everv r.rime known to the law. Of
these, two hundred and nineteen were
convicted and received sentence.
Judge Wiley who presides in this court
has acquired an unenviable notoriety by
the Marv Harris trial a trial whicti
will long be the opprobrium of this
court. There lias been a great increase
of crime in the city within the last
three years. It. cannot be otherwise
while so large a number of drinkiug sa
loons are constantly open and while the
usages of society are tolerant of the
free use of alcoholic drinks. t.
Thk wants oh.tue Fkkepmkn. The
following communication from Mr.
George Whipple, together with the pre
fatory endorsement of the Boston
Dally Advertiser is taken from that pa
per. We h"ie our readers will ponder
well its coutents. Our exchanges are
filled with statements which more than
corroborate all that is mentioned in
this communication, with regard to the
wants and sufferings of the freedmen.
It has been suggested that this subject
be laid before the people at the union
meet-ing on Thanksgiving day, and it
probablv will be. What could be more
suitable and appr opriate 1 1n a private
letter addressed to a clergyman of this
place, Mr. Tappan offers topayall expenses
of freight on such packages as may be
i-eat to his care. '
"Distress amoxg thb Fkebdmkn. We
print below a letter from one of the sec
retaries of the American Missionary As
sociation, which shows the pressing
necessity for immediate action on be
half of the freedmen of the South. We
learn that our respected fellow-citizen,
Mr. Chas. Tappan, to whom the letter is
addressed, has undertaken to collect
clothing, blankets and supplies of all
kinds .for this object. Mr. Tappan will
take charge of and forward such sup
plies or money as may be sent to 114
Washington street, Boston, and confided
to his care for this purpose :
American Missionaby Association,
New York, Nov, 4, 1865. J
. Charles Tappan, Esq., My Dear Sir
Yours of the 2'2d inst was duly received,
and we rejoice to learn that you are
once more ready to devote your time,
without compensation, lor the benent oi
the freedmen or tne South. Lei me as
sure you, that there never was a time
when such help was more needed. The
following extracts from a document re
cently prepared by one of the secretaries
of this Association will present the facts
which justify the generous efforts you
DroDosed to make, and call loudly for
the benefactions of the philanthropist
and Christian.
From the superintendents of schools,
from officers appointed by Government
and others, alarming reports relative to
the condition and prospects of the freed
men have clamed our attention, and de
mand immediate action.
The restoration of abandoned and con
fiscated lands is fa"',, rendering houseless
aud homeles;; and helpless thousands of
these, families. In one district of Vir
ginia, the present superintendent says
that probably fifteen thousand or these
people will be turned away from their
homes and left with no means of sup
port. On one plantation or farm called
Acretoii, because each family had one
acre assigned were three hundred
families, many wives and cnllilren or
widows and orphans oi colored soldiers.
This farm is ordered to be cleared.
In another district of Virginia it is
estimated by those best qualified to
know that not less than twenty thou
sand persons will be made homeless, and
the Superintendent of the Schools in
that State under the Assistant Commis
sioner of the Bureau says, that in Eas
tern Virginia at a low estimate, the
number who are thus being ejected from
the farms, which are being repossessed
by late rebel owners, cannot be less than
70,000, and that the great majority of
them will be left not only utterly home
less, but without any possible means of
support, just at the beginning of winter.
Disease and death have already com
menced their work, and we dare not
trust ourselves to state the number of
those who, it is estimated, must perish
before the opening of Spring, unless the
kindness of Government or an aboun
ding charity bring swift relief.
Like causes are coming into opera
tion in South Carolina and elsewhere,
and thousands upon thousands unless
government interposes in their behalf
will be driven from their little homes
and left by former owners to perish.
Wishing you great success, I am,
" Very respectfully yours, &c,
v ' Gbo. Whipplb, Cor. Sec."
Political. John Van Buren, at the
Hoffman ratification meeting recently
held in New York," Very humorously
referred to his recent defeat in tho state.
He said: '
"I thank you for this kind reception.
It gratifies me exceedingly to see a meet
ing so large in numbers, so respectable
in appearance, so full of enthusiasm and
spirit, upon an occasion of so much in
terest. And it is to me a source of great
gratification that, having recently come
out of a canvass a badly defeated candi-
date, I find still so many friendly faces
to welcome me. I am afraid there is
some mlsapprehenslou, and It may be
supposed that It is ray successful com
petitor instead or myseir tnai is anoui
to address you. If not, I think I shall
console myself hereafter with the reflec
tion that one finds more menus ui ad
versity than success, and iu a crowded
city like tills, so full of accideuts, the
safest place for a man to carry his head
Is under his arm."

Singino School. We are requested
to state that Mr. II. A. Scott will com
mence a singing school this evening un
der the auspices of the Congregational
Society at their Chapel.
A Civil Question. Will the ijattle

post-office, between twelve and one
o'clock p. m. yesterday, have the polite
ness to return it to the lady whose ad
dress was upon the envelope which he

Rutland. Dec. 5, 1865.
A Fight. We understand there was
a disgraceful row in a cellar on Mer
chants' Row yesterday afternoon; and
after the two principal belligerents had
pommeled each other for the space of
about fifteen minutes they were taken to
jail by Constable Saddler.
Select School. There will be a se
lect school opened In PerkinS' Block, up
stairs, ou Monday, Dec. 12th, by Miss M.
A. Grixton. It is unnecessary for us to
recommend her to those who have chil
dren old enough to attend school, for
she is well known as a teacher in this
village.
Accident. Last Tuesday, while Mr.
Asa Clough of Ira was chopping on a
steep hillside, he was badly injured by a
tree that was felled by another man.
Ills leg was broken 1n two places, and
he was bruised pretty much all over.
He was taken home, his broken limb set,
and it is bePeveJ that by good nursing
he will recover in due time.
An Ego. Mr. C. J. Powers has shown
us the egg of a pullet that has just made
her debut. This egg measures eggs-actly
2 1-4 inches in circumference, and is
somewhat smaller than a robin's egg.
The pullet is an ordinary-sized hen, and
she probably intends to begin as she
can hold out.
At the last County Fair we had a
competition between the slowest walk
ing horses ; now let us have one between
the smallest laying hens.
Thk Weather. It rained all day yes
terday. The weather continues warm,
and the mud grows thick-and-thinner.
Goon Scholars. A few days since we
copied from the Brattleboro Phenix a
paragraph stating the proficiency .of a
class In the Geography and History of
Vermont. A friend has reminded us ef
what in fact we knew before, that some
of the scholars of Rutland have done
better. Last year, quite a number of
the members of the High School, and
we believe of the other schools, were
able to draw upon the blackboard, from
memory alone, maps of Vermont, giving
all the counties in their proper size,
shape and location. They were alBO
able to draw a map of Rutland County,
and place therein accurately every town,
together with all the principal streams
that passed through. We recollect that
one or more of the scholars at the exam
ination drew a map of the town and
village or Rutland on a large scale, giv
ing the streets and pointing out all the
principal buildings. This matter, as we
have understood, was taken up by the
teachers, without having themselves had
the benefit of any previous training. By
availing themselves of such assistance
as they could obtain from books, and
by falling back upon their own ingenu
ity and perseverance, they overcame all
obstacles, and brought this branch of
instruction to a high degree of perfec
tion. Secretary Adams has been accus
tomed to carry about a great many maps
drawn by the Rutland scholars, to show
other teachers and schools what can be
dons by those who try. We recommend
this subject to the consideration of
teachers this winter.
West Rutland. Editor Rutlund Ltcr
aid: I noticed in the Courier of the 1st
Inst, a mere reference to a surprise party
which occurred in West Rutland on the
evening of Nov. 23d.
The Courier says that 100 or more of
the neighbors, " prompted by the well
known generosity of Franklin Blanch
ard, visited him a few evenings since,
and left a rich, rare and valuable pres
ent with his son, Chalon Blanchard.''
Here is an error, which I wish to cor
rect through your wide-spread columns.
The generosity of Franklin Blanchard
in all benevolent acts is known to every
inhabitant of thin place, and the Inter
est which he has manifested in the fur
therauce of religion is, we trust, duly
appreciated by all j but It was uo beu
evolence of his which luduced his neigh
bors on this occasion to throng his
house, and leave with his son a very
valuable present, consisting of a large
silver pitcher, two silver goblets inlaid
with gold, a server, a most beautiful
butter dish, and also a silver terreen and
ladle.
These article.-, purchased of Mr. Chase
at an expense of some eighty dollars,
form, us wo believe, the most valuable
present of silver ware which litis been
presented to any citizen of Rutlaud for
many years.
The untiring efforts of Mr. Chalou
Blanchard in all religious acts, his un
ceasing exertions to sustain and improve
our choir, are deeds which are known
and have been felt, aud will be long re
membered by each Inhabitant of our
rural village.
From boyhood he has been a member
of our choir, ever present and willing
to act his part. For tho past six years
he has furnished a mclodeon for the
church, and presided at the same for
four years. During the last four years
he has been leader of the cholr.and their
efforts on all occasions show plainly
that their leader merits the very highest
praise.
He has on one occasion presented th
choir with a full set of books. j
These acts done quietly and unosten
tatiously, all compensation having been
refused, are the causes which induced
over 200 of his friends of all ages to as
semble at his father's house In the form
of a surprise party, and to make him
the presents referred to.
The presentation was made by Dr.
-Sheldon in a very appropriate manner,
merely referring to the acts which led
to so happy a result.
In reply, Mr. Blanchard thanked them
in a most befitting manner for the kind
ness which they were showing him,
and he only hoped that his past actions,
taken in connection with future ones,
might make him worthy of such a
He" said he should not only prize the
presents for their intrinsic value, bnt i.e
should ever cherish them as au exponent
of the feelings of his friends.
The table, filled with all kinds of del
icacies, was one of the finest ever beheld
in West Rutland, which circumstance-
allow it to be a conceit of ours if you
please is the greatest compliment that
could be paid it.
The evening was spent in a most jo
vial and happy manner, aud the disap
pearance of the eatables showed there
was no delicacy on that subject. Music,
both vocsl and instrumental, was fur
nished in abundance, which added much
to the pleasure of all, and a duet per
formed by Miss Helen Tuttle and Mr.
Blanchard wait considered as one of the
finest exercises of the occasion.
At a late hour the party separated,
and as they went to their several homes
each seemed to feel the truth of the
scripture" It is more blessed to give
than to receive."

8 at. mov ixn Shad. The Fish Com
missioners of Massachusetts, New Hamp
shire and Vermont, met at Lawrence on
Thursday last, to talk over the question
of building tishways and restoring shad
and salmon in the Connecticut and Mer-
rimac rivers.
Mustered Out. Major Harry Brown
son of Rutland, Of the Quartermaster's
Department, has been recently honora
bly mustered out of service. In Angust
last Maj. Brownson was assigned to the
Chief Quartermastershipof the Military
District of Washington, which he held
for some time until he was appointed
with Col. Luddington on a commission
to settle land claims of so-called loyal
ists in Fairfax County, Ga. The Major
leaves the service with a first-rate rec
ord as being an energetic and faithful
officer.
Thief Caught. On the evening of
Nov. 28th, a man, whose name we have
not learned, but who claims to belong in
Bridport, hired a team of Mr. James
Phelps of Bellows Falls to go as he said
about two miles. Not returning ac
cording to agreement, Mr. Phelps pro
ceeded to telegraph in all directions,
and last Monday Constable Button of
Brandon arrested the thief and recov
ered the property horse, buggy, harn
ess, whip and buffalo. - The man has
had his trial in Britdon, and ordered to
recognize in the sum of (500, in default
of which he has been lodged in jail in
this town.
Two individuals are now lying in
jail for stealing horses from Mr. Phelps
within a week or two, If there are any
"more of the same sort," in training for
like performances, they can here have
as opportunity of taking a view of the
prospect that lies before them.
"Not the man." The Manchester N.
H. Mirror of the 2nd inst says ; "A
week ago, Mr. wru. H utter ny was ar
rested here for stealing a horse aud waif,
gnu at Rutland, Vermont, and was eon
fined in jail uutll the appearance of wit
nesses These have not come to hand,
uothing but a telegraphic dispatch
from the owuer of the horse, that But
terfly it the wrong man. He has there,
fore lieeii released from confinement."
The Daily Herald A 4;otl Time
to Subkcril.n.
The approachiug Session of Oongiess
which commences nixt Monday will
undoubtedly be one of the most import
ant ever held since the foundation of
the tJoverumeut, and the doings of that
body will lie looked upon by the Ameri
can people with intense interest. Every
thing which transpires will be sought
after and read with avidity. Iu order
to gratify the wishes and answer the
reasonable expectations of our patrons,
us well as to fulfill our duties to an en
lightened and generous public, we have
made arrangements to receive kull tkl
eorapaic riports of the doings of that
body, together with such other matters
as shall be of general Interest. These
will be published in the Herald on the
morning following each day's session.
As It is now expected that Congress
will be able to organize without any
delay, we shall hope to be able to pub
lish the President's Message as soon
as next Wednesday. At any rate we in
tend to give it as soon as any o! the city
papers.
These arrangements, we hardly need
sav. will be atteuded with considerable
outlay to ourselves, but we incur the nec
essary expense without hesitation in the
confident belief that our efforts will be
generously responded to by the public.
We therefore earnestly request our
friends in the different towns and vil
lages where the Daily circulates, that
they will iuterest themselves in this
matter, and lend us a helping baud. We
will grant them as favorable terms as
possible ; in all places iu which clubs of
five or more are formed we will give a
daily paper to any oue who will take
charge of the bundle.
We should not omit to mention that
there is no paper in the State that gives
a fuller account of "local" matters than
the Daily Herald.
The regular terms are $8.00 a year, or
$2 for three months; and to Newsmen,
2 a hundred.
Thb Senator from North Carolina.
The Hon. William Graham, Senator
elect from North Carolina is well known
to political fame. He is 65 years old.
Iu 1841 he was chosen to the United
States Senate from North Carolina, his
native State, and served three years. He
was Governor of his State from 1841 to
184'J. Subsequently he was Secretary
of the Navy under President Fillmore,
and was run on the ticket with Gen.
Scott for Vice President. When the re
bellion broke out he adhered to the
Southern party and represented his
State in the rebel Senate. He ha not
been pardoned and consequently mast
take his place on the outside of hU new
honors until his reconstruction is per
fee ted.
Virginia. The Virginia Legislature
met Monday, at Richmond. John D
Baldwin, a strong Unionist before the
war. but nevertheless a member of the
rebel Congress, was chosen Speaker,
Governor Pierpoint's Message was read.
He says that the State owes 811,000,000,
and has $22,000,000 of available assets
The interest due on Jan. 1 is overfG.OOO,
000. He recommends a tax upon the
oyster business, and the sale of the State
interest in railways, which might re
duced the debt by $16,000,000. He thinks
but little legislation is required concer
ning freedmen, and advocates their ad
mission to the courts on the same basis
as white persons, The repeal of usury-
laws is reccora mended, and the messa.
closes with an exhortation to support
the Union in the payment of taxes and
every other way.
It is reported in Richmond that Gene
ral Butler will assume command of the
Department of Virginia ou the 8th of
next month.
