What a National Committeeman Has
- to Say About Blaine and Presi
dent Harrison.
Special by The Untied Pns.s 1
New Yobk, Dec. 13. B. C. Jones,
ex-chairman of tho republican mail
committee, came from Pittsburg on
Thursday to look after some of his
business in this city. Ho was talking
with A. li. Whitney, a well known
iron merchant, and others in 3Ir.
Whitney's office, when tho conversa
tiop drifted to politics, and almost
before he wag aware of it, Mr. Jones
was discussing the situation in this
way:
"There is only one course for the
republican party to pursue. It is that
indicated by PresidentHarrison. Wo
must stand by our principles, for
without tho policy of protection our
party is noihing. We could not even
carry the state of Pennsylvania, if it
were known that wo had lowered onr
standard, because -we happened to
meet with defeat in a single cam
paign." "What do yon think of the elec
tion?" was asked.
"Think of it; why, smply this, that
tho people were deceived again by
democratic trickery and falsehood.
Our opponents harped on the danger
of high prices and the increased cost
of living in consequence of the Mc
Kinleybill. Their papers were filled
with such stuff until the people really
began to think there was something
in it"
Then they sent out bogus tin ped
dlers to sell wares at all sorts of ridic
ulous prices and worked up all sorts
of schemes until thousands and thou
sands of citizens were perauaded that
the republican party had been legisJ
lating against the interests of the
workingmen.
"Now it may be you think lam
putting too much emphasis on this
point, but I am not. Trickery is a
very important factor in campaigns.
Grover Cleveland was o'eoted presi
dent of tho United States by it and no
sensiblo man, whether democrat or re
publican, will deny it now.
"There was absolutely nothing in
that utterance of Mr. Burchard or
that talk about the Belshazzar feast
in the campaign of 18S4, yet other
things were shrewdly worked as they
were by the astute German, which de
feated Blaine, as every one knows.
"The president's message was one
of tho best state papers ever issued
from the White house. It was manly,
wise and ominently statesmanlike. In
my judgment it has demonstrated the
fact that as things stand now, Benja
min Harrison is the strongest and
most acceptable man for tho party to
nominate in 1892.
"I think James G.Blaine is the man
whom wo must nominate if wo expect
to win," was the prompt reply of Mr.
Whitney-to a question.
"Oh! Blaine wouldn't take it," said
Mr. Jones. "Why he docs not want
the worry and vexation a presidential
campaign involves. I am sure ho
would not accept the place it offered
to him."
"What about Alger?" was asked.
"I don't think ho would touoh bot
tom, so lo speak," replied Mr. Jones,
and he added. "No, he wouldn't do.
I am speaking now from a purely poli
tical point of view."

Special by Tho Ustxkd PbesvJ
Los AkqeiiES, Dec. 18. A report
has just reached this city of a fatal
accident which occurred on the At
lantic and Paoific road near Tho
Needles in which two men were killed.
As the overland passenger train,
west bound, was nearing the Colorado
river, and while tho train was running
through a dense fog the engineer was
horrified at seeing the rear cars of a
freight train looming up just ahead.
Though every effort was made to stop
the train tho distance was too short
and the train was running at too high a
rate of speed.
Th'o engine dashed into "tho caboose
with fearful violence. The engineer
escaped with trifling injuries but his
fireman was almost instantly killed.
One other, but whether an employe
or passenger, cannot be learned, was
so severely injured that he died soon
after. Several cars were derailed and
the passengers received a severe shak
ing up though none of them were ser
iously hurt
Fifteen trunks were badly wrecked
in one of the baggage cars which was
almost totally destroyed.
Only meagre reports have been re
ceived and railroad men will not talk.
Later. It is learned that the name
of one of the men killed was M. A.
Thompson, a cattle breeder of Iowa,
who was shipping blooded cattle to
Southern California. He was in tho
caboose of the freight train and was
crushed into a jelly. It is also stated
that five passengers were fatally in
jured. 3IARIXE NEWS AND NOTES.

Washington, Dec. 13. Capt. O.
Selfridge, president of the commission
of the army and navy officers and
civilians appointed by the president
to select a site for a proposed dry
dock on tho northwest coast of the
country, forwarded the report of the
commission to the president to-day.
"While nominally, to select a Bite for a
dry dock, the real purpose of the com cem com
misseon: w.ig fr , fiftlfflf- ft Qifa fvr a
navy yard as well.
The board of naval offices, with
Capt. A. L. Mahon, as senior member,
was sent out last year to select a site
for a navy yard and reported in favor
oE Point Turner on Port Orchard, an
arm ot Puget Sound. There was so
much criticism of the site selected,
inspired largely by people interested
in naval sites, that congress provided
for a commission to do the work over
again.
Their report will not be published
until it is transmitted to congress, but
it is stated on good authority that the
decision of the first commission has
been sustained.
The commission is composed of
Captain Thomas O. Selfridge, Lieu
tenant A. B. Wickoff, Colonel Geo. C.
Mendel, corps of engineers, Ex-Secre-tarv
ot the Navy Bichard Thompson
aud Ex-Senator T. O. Piatt. They
visited every available locality in tho
Puget sound, and Oregon region and
examined all the proposed sites in
detail.
