Drt. A ykr : I seldom fail to remove Eruptioni and
Scrofnloui Sorei by the persevering use of your

"tor twelve years 1 had the yellow Eryalpctai on

decided that my arm mnst be amputated, i I began
taking your Sarbapabilla. Took two bottles, and
some ul your I'ii.ls. Togeiher they have cured me.
I am now us well and sound as anybody. Being in a

nitrate of sliver and other remedies, wit hout any -
larent effect. For ft It ecu days we guarded his humls,
eat with them he should tearopeu the festering and
corrupt wound which covered his whole lace. Hav
ing tried every thing else we had any hope from, we
began giving your Sahsap akili.a, and applying
the iodide ol potash lotion, as you direct. 1 lie sore
began to hcul when we had given the first bottle,
and was well when we had finished the second. The
child's eyelashes, which had come out, grew again,
and lie is now as healthy and fair as any other The
whole neighborhood predicted that the child must
die." ,
Syphilis and Mercurial Disease.
From Jr. Iliram Stoat, of St. Louil. Miamnrl
"I find your Sarbaparilla a more ellectual
remedy- tbr the secondary symptoms of Syphili;
and for syphilitic discoso than any other wc possess.
The profession are indebted to you for tome of. the
best medicines we have." j
From A. J. French, M. V., on eminent flhiisician of
J. Imenet MaM.,i;ho is a prominent member qf
the Legislature of Maachmett$.
"Dtt. ArKit My dear Sir: I have round your
Sarsaparii.la an excellent remedy lor Syiihilii,
both of the primary and tecondary type, and effect-
other remedies. I do not know what we Can em
ploy with more certainty of success, where a power
ful alterative is required." .
Mr. Chat. S. Van Licte, of Neva Brunrwcl; K J.,
had dreadful ulcert on his legs, caused by the abuse
of mercury, or mercurial disease, which grew moro
and more aggravated for years, In spite of every
remedy or treatment that oould boopplicd, until the
persevering use of Avkii's Saiisai-aiulla relieved
him. Ksw nases can lie found more inveterate and
'distressing than this, and it took several dozen bot
tles to euro mm. .I,,
Zioueorrhcea, Whites, IPemale, Weakness,
re generally produoed by internal Scrofulous Ulcer
ation, and are very often cured by the alterative
effect of this Sarbaparilla. Homo cases require,
however, in aid of the Haraataiulla, the ekillui
application of local remedies.
From the wetl-htown and vsidely-ceUbrated Dr.
Jacob Morrill, qf Cincinnati.
"I hnvo found your S arsaparili a an excellent
alterative in diseases of female. : Many cases of ir
regularity, Leucorrlicea, Internal Ulceration, aud
local debility, arising from the scrofulous diathesis,
have yielded to it, and there are few Hint do not,
when its effect is properly aided by local treatment."
A lady, unwilling to allow the publication of her
, , unfile, writes:
"My daughter and myself have hcen cured of a
Very debilitating Lcticorrhrea of long standing, by

The Press on the President's Message.
Wat II net enough lo reqtl-san oith to im
port tbe Constitution of tbe United State?, and
all laws made and aots done in pursoaaoe if it?
Why foroo the negro In the very nostrils of tbe
Southern man whose submlelon to law yoa
seek I- Is It said theoath requires no more than
that? Wilh all doe respect to Mr. Lincoln it
requires a great deal more. It requires tbe top
put of a proo'amvlon which ne half of tbe
people of the North do not support. It re
quires tbe support of laws which one half of
the people of the North repndUte ae null
and void, beoauee unconstitutional. The doo
trine is not yet forced on Amerlosna that the
mast obey a law ontll it is deolared onoon
titntlooal, This proclamation requires the
taking of an oath, as a condition of pardon,
wbiob half tbecit'seus of the Northern States
wonld refuse to take. It is true that tbe Presi
dent may proffer psrdon oo coadl lona. But the
question ia whether bla conditions are wlie,
prsoiio.l, likely to do good. We are very
muoa afraid ibat the Administration knows no
more bow to make peace tban It has hereto
fore seemed to know abont making war. We
ace no prospect oi peace or good to the country
in Ibe Pieildent's plan On tbe ooatrary, we
fear be has thrown away a golJen opportunity
for the oonntry, for the aake of winnlug a an,e
porl among Northern radicals for himself.
[From the Chicago Times.]

he f ffors will rather still innoer unimeme re

The President appears to be not very firmly

tbem haltingly. Bat it bis been haltingly that

[From the Rochester Union.]
The President's "oostsorlot"or Proolamatlcn
la destined to fa! 8 11 the expeoiatlnns ol the ao
faor: it will oreate a aensation. Tbe Presidei t
assumes the funotlone of Supreme Lawgiver i r
u elisor, ana proceeds to presoribe Ibe mode tv
whlea tbe Union Is to be reconetrao ed. He
affeots a oommeudable degree of meekoesi by
referrlnp; to Corgrets aod the Judioisrv as nos
seeslng some ooutlngntrlgbta lo modify or.re-
vtte nta programme; bat then aa a aettoff lo
this meek conoeejioo, be oonoludet bis Pioola
matlon with Ihees pregnant words:
. "Tbe mode preeoated is tbe best the Execu
tive can suggest. vVlih Ibe present loinrea
sion, no other possible mode wonld be accept
ed." Then, whatever Congreas or the Judiciary
my see fit to da in the premises, tbe "imprra-
alon" of the Eica lve is to eland as tbe Su
preme Liw. "With tbe present Impression no
other possible mode would be sooepted." Aod
it must be rerxeabered that Mr. Llneoln is
eanevtatloost Commander-in-Chief oi tie Army
and navy of tne united siates. Aooordiirgly
be has means at bis disposal quite adequate to
giving effect to bit "impressions" as against
tbe action ol Cjngrese aod the Jad'oliry.
Ae to tbe merits of the "mode" prescribed
by Mr. Lioooln, toe preis might aa well remain
silent; since, whether right or wrong, praotlo-
aoie or lmpraotlotble. ooustltntional or nnooo
silintlonal, sensible or rldlnuloua, be proolalms
ii ae tne only mode that win be acoepted by
him, while bis "present Impressions" lemain
nnchanged. Tbej stand now as the lest and
standard of '"ojalty." He may alter or amend
I standard to-morrow; bat bis 'present im
presslens" are the Supreme Law of today;
aod lo them as "loyal subjects" we mast con
form or Inoar tbe odinm, lo say nothing of Ibe
paucities attsehing to "treason" not treason
ae defiued bv tbe Constitution: but treason as
Ibe meaning of 'that term is modified under the
preisare or "military necessity" and by lb'
"present impressions" of tbe Commender-ln
