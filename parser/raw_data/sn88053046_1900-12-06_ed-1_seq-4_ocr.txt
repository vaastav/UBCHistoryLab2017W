In the main, the message is a review
of the occurrences of the year—a re
cital of the facts of history. The most
important eubjeots treated are the
troubles in China and the situation in
the Philippines. With regaid to the
former, the tone of tho message is com
mendable. The President does not join
in the bloodthirsty clamor for life and
trrasuro as reprisals for the damage
inflioted by the revolution,but suggests
that, "due compensation
in part by increased guarauteeB of se
curity for fcieign rights and immuni
ties," and by the "opening of China
to the equal commerce of all the
world." He favorably inclines to Rus
sia's suggestion that the matter of in
demnities be relegated to the Court of
Arbitration at Tho Hague. In this
treatment of the Chinese question, the
President will not pleaso the hot
headed advocates of war and blood
shed, but his views will meet with the
approbation of tho real, solid senti
ment of the country.
With respect to the Philippine situ
ation, the President seoins inclined to
throw the burden of tho solution upon
Congress, without recommending any
detailed plan of action. He reviews the
events of tbo past voar in the Philip
pines, and professes to be pleased at the
"favorable progress" towards the paci
fication of the islands. He again calls
tho Filipinos the "wards of the
Nation," and says it is our duty to
treat them so that "our flag may ba no
less beloved in the mountains of Luzon
and the fertile zones of Mindanoa and
Negros than it is at homo; and that
there, as here, it shall be tho revered
symbol of liberty, enlightenment, and
progress in every avenue of develop
ment." What a hollow mookeiy these
words are. How

With respect to financial matters, the
President recommends that Congress
"provide whatever further legislation
is needed to insure the continued
parity, under all conditions, between
two forms of metallic money, silver
and gold. " Evidently, the old iovo is
still strong, though slumbering, and
Mr. McKinley cannot forget his so
licitude for the interests of the white
metal. The President recommends a
reduction of tho war taxes to tho oxtont Regular
of 830,000,000 per year, in view of tbe
existing treasury surplus.
President McKinley treats tho ques
tion of trusts very gingerly, and admits
'heir existence, notwithstanding that
Mark Hanna so positively declared that
'there is nonsuch thing as a trust"
lie repeats tbe mild language of his
last message, that "restraints upon
injurious,
within Federal juris
diction, should be properly applied by
tbo Congress. " How tho trust mag
nates will smilo at this.
By teasou of the new possessions, tbe
need of coast dofenoes, and new army
posts, the President is convinced that
will require an army of at least
G0,00ü men, and he holds that "during
the prisent conditions in Cuba and tbe
Philippines" a force of 100,000 men
will be necessary. He also wants per
mission to raise a force of 15,01)0 native
troops in the Philippi
better it would have been had tbe
President reoommeuc'ed steps to stop
the war in tbe Philippines, and thus
remove the la9t pretext for any increase
in our army.
The concluding recommendations of
the President to tho effect that ex
travagance in expenditures and appro
priations be avoided, are timely and
pertinent. But, in view of existing
conditions, there is a touoh of irony
in his final injunction: "Let us always
keep in mind that tbe foundation of
government is liberty; its supers
tructure peace."
It would bo far better if President
McKinley would make this injunction
effective by the acts of his administra
tion.

The advice of the Index, which is in
accord with what Every Evening has
advocated since tbe e eotion, is sound of
and practical. Particularly suggestive a
is tho last reaeon it advances in sup
port of its position, that "Democratic
and Regular Republican fusion would
weaken both parties and strengthen in
the Union Republican party foi tho and
future." There is no doubt in the
world about th 's. Mure than that;
Any attempt to arrange a deal for the and
election of one Democrat ard one Reg
ular Republican would be fraught with
the danger of affording opportunity to
effect a counter deal for the election even
of Addicks and a Demociat. That Boss the
Addicks would make any kind of a
deal promising to result in bis election
cannot be doubted.
It is the duty of tho Demooratio
members of the General Assembly to the
defeat. Boss Addicks, and not to engi- by
nner nny kind of a deal for the election a
of a Democratic Sonator. A Democrat
in tbo Ucited States Senate at this
time would not do the Democratic
party a particle of good; but Addioks
in the Senate would do the Democratic
îarty a great deal of harm.
Thoie should be no deal or fusion, or
preliminary arrangement of any, kind
about this matter. The Democratic
members of the Legislatuio should
simply confer together and agree to
vote for any two good men whom tho
Regular Republicans may name. It is
not presumed that the Regulars would
propose any but satisfactory candidates,
as they have a wealth of very good
material from which to make selec
tions. When they name their selec
tions, let tho Democratic members vote
for them solidly.

Despite this storm of partisan abuse,

he spent the dollar before getting reg

swore positively that Dr. Moore gave

After such a crushing defeat r aa was

it cannot expect to win victories. It
must abandon the paths of Populism,

the Constitution and the law. It must
