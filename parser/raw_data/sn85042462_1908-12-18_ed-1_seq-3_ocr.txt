LOS ANGELES HERALD: FRIDAY MORNING, DECEMBER 18, 1908.
PRESIDENT MUST
FURNISH PROOF
OF CORRUPTION
HOUSE CALLS ON ROOSEVELT
FOR EVIDENCE
INSISTS THAT SPECIFIC CHARGES
SHALL BE MADE
Resolution Passed Unanimously by
Solons Asking Chief Executive; to
Substantiate Insinuations Made
Concerning Secret Service
WASHINGTON, Dec. 17. — Chair
man Perkins of the house spe
l clal committee appointed to rec
ommend a course of action relative to
the suggestions of. the president in hia
annual message concerning the secret
service, to which members of congress
have taken exceptions, presented a re
port of that committee at the begin
ning of today's session of the house.
The house adopted tho Perkins reso
lution withoua a dissenting vote and
after very little comment.
Mr. Cockran of New York suggested
that it should bo made applicable to
congress as a whole and not merely to
the. house, but the change was not
made. .
The preamble follows: *
"Whereas, there was contained in the
sundry civil bill which passed congress
at its last session and became a law a
provision in reference to the employ
ment of the secret service of the treas
ury department, and
"Whereas, in the last annual message
of the president of the United States
to the two houses of congress it "was
stated in reference to that provision:
'It is not too much to say that this
amendment . has boen of benefit onl
and could be of benefit only to criminal
classes,' and it was further stated, 'th
chief argument in favor of the pro
vision was that the congressmen dii
not themselves wish to be investigated
by secret service men,' and it was fui
ther stated, 'but if this Is not consid
ered desirable a special exception coul
be made in the law prohibiting the use
of the secret service force in Invest!
gating members of congress. It woul
be. far better to do this than to do
what actually was done and'strive to
prevent or at least to hamper effect
ive action against criminals by the ex
ecutive branch of the government.'
Implies. Congressmen Fear Exposure
"Whereas, the plain meaning of the
above words is that the majority of
congressmen are in fear of being In
vestigated by secret service men and
that congress as a whole was actuated
by that motive in enacting the pro
vision in question, and
"Whereas, your committee appointed
to consider these statements of the
president and report to the house can
not find in the hearings before com
mittees nor in the records of the house
or senate any justification of this im
peachment of the horfor and integrity
of the congress, and
"Whereas, your committee would pre
fer. in order to make an intelligent
and comprehensive report,, just to the
president as well as to the congress,
to have all the information which the
president may have, therefore be it
"Resolved, that the president be re
quested to transmit to the house any
evidence upon which he based . his
statement that the 'chief argument in
'avor of the provision was that the
congressmen did not themselves wish
to be investigated by secret service
men,' and also to transmit to the house
any evidence connecting any member
of the house of the sixtieth congress
with corrupt action in his official ca
pacity, and to inform the house wheth
er he has instituted proceedings for
the punishment of any such individual
by the courts, or has reported any such
alleged delinquence to the house."
Unanimously Recommended
In reporting the resolution Mr. Per
kins said it had be,en unanimously
recommended by the special committee,
and paid as soon as the president
should send in any information in his
possession the committee would make
another report for the consideration
of the house.
, Representative John Sharp Williams
expressed the hope the resolution
would be adopted promptly. He said
the committee would impartially report
on "this seemingly unprovoked and un
justified attack upon the honesty and
reputation of the legislative branch of
the government."
"So far as the committee knows,"
said Mr. Williams, "there is not a
scintilla of evidence to support that
statement by the president. The com
mittee has thought it would bo fair
to the president to give him further
opportunity to produce testimony if he
has any. The American people have
a right to know if the American con
gress be corrupt."
"Such a procedure." he continued,
would allow the country which he said
"was the master of both of us" to ex
ercise judgment in tho matter.
The special committee, ho said,
would remain In session to receive,
compare and weigh whatever compe
tent evidence the president can fur
nish with fair and just impartiality.
Mr. Williams said the committee was
actuated by a desire to be entirely just
to the president.
Mr. Keifer of Ohio wanted to know
whether the words "if not incompat
ible with the public service" should be
inserted, as is usual on calling upon
the president for information. This
suggestion called forth laughter, and
Mr. Perkins declared the resolution as
worded was "a request for informa
tion," and was imperative in its word-
inff.
Mr. Perkins cut off further discus
sion by demanding the previous ques
tion and Speaker Cannon, calling for
•a viva voce vot,o, there was a chorus of
"ayes" favoring the- passage of the
resolution, followed by a dond silence
wherj the "noes" were called for.
