Thahm3Ivino.--Thanksgiving day was ob
' served by most of oar citizens. Divine ser
vices were had in several ol the churches.
White. During the last week the weather
has been quite like winter, in this region.
Several inches of .mow fell, rd the oarth now
wears its accustomed white mantle, and the
streams wRl soobe confined in their chan
nels by the icy bandsofBoreas'
A Pbesknt. Miss Emma Barclay will please
aceept our thanks for a number of very fino
apples, sent us on last Thanksgiving day. May
he be so fortunate as to have "some of the
"sort" on each returning thanksgiving day
and we the recipients of a present.
Jjost' A. Newfoundland dog eight or nine
' months old, black" and curly, except white on
the breast, a little white on the back of the
neck, fore feet and tail tipped with white.
Any one finding such a pup and returning him,
or giving information of him to the subscriber
shall be suitably rewarded. - Alex. M'Leod.
Jotocs. The few inches of snow, has made
the juvenile portion of our town quite jubilant ;
and, no doubt, "old winter" is a more wel-
' come visitor to them than any., other season of
the year, for with it always come the skates,
the sled, and. other sports, so much admired
and enjoyed by children. But whilo they cn-
' Joy these -sports, they should remember that
these privileges are granted to them by a good
and a merciful God. '
Pessacola Navi-Yard Burned. By re
cent news from the south, we learn that
Captain. Brown, who. is in command of Fort
Fickens, has succeeded in. burning thePcnsa--cola
Navy-yard, by throwing hot shot into it
from the Fort. . The distance is about G miles,
and must have taken some sharp shooting to
accomplish its destruction. This is consider
able cf a loss to the United States Govern
ment; bnt at the same time it nlay prove of
much greater inconvenience to the rebels who
have no navy. Be this 'as it may, important
or not important to the government, the Navy
yard has been destroyed.. Cut the most im
portant news which we have to communicate
to the people of this county at the present is,
that Richard Mossop has just opened a large
stock oi goods at his cheap cash store ; which,
we are told he is selling exceeding low for
cash. All who are interested in this fact,
should call and make the proper inquiry with
out delay; --''' - '''
Intercourse at the Table. To meet at the
breakfast, table father, mother, children, all
well, oright to be a happiness to any heart ; it
should be a source of humble gratitude, and,
should wake up the warmest feelings of our
nature. Shame on the contemptible and low
bed cur, whether parent or child, that, can
never come totle breakfast table, where the
family have met in health, only to frown and
whine, and growl, and lre.t. It is prima facie
evidence of a mean, and grovelling, and self-
hit, and degraded nature, whencesoever the
churl may have sprung. Nor is it lejs repre
benniWe to make such exhibitions at the tea-
table; for before the morning comes, some of
the circle may be stricken by some deadly dis
ease, to gather round that table not again for
ever. Children Jn good health, if left to
themselves at the table, become, after a few
ntouthsfols, garrulous and noisy, but if within
stall bearable bounds it is better to let them
alone, they eat less, because they do not eat
so rapidly as if compelled to keep silent, while
the very exhiliration of spirits quickens the
irctt!.ition of the vital fluids, and energizes
digestion and assimilation. The extremes of
society curiously meet in this regard.. .The
tables of the rich and the nobles of England
are models of mirth, wit and bonhommie; it
tkes hours to get through a repast, and they
Jive long. If anybody will look in upon the
negroes of a well-to-do family in Kentucky
while at their meals, they cannot but, be im
pressed with tho perfect abandon of jabber,
cachination and mirth ; it seems as if they
could talk all day, and they live long. It lol
lops then, that at the family table all should
meet, and do it habitually, to make a common
interchange of high-bred courtesies, of warm
flections, or cheering mirthfulness, and that
generosity of nature which lifts ns above tho
brutes which perish, promotive of these things
re of good digestion,high health and long life.
ono but a physician knows how much a
reliable alleraliu is needed by the people.
On all nides of us, in all communities every
where there are multitudes that suffer from
"mplaints that nothing but an alterative cures.
Hence a great many of them have been made
"! pit abroad with the assurance of being
Actual. But they fail to accomplish tho
cures they promise because they have not the
intrinsic virtne they claim. In this state of

The Latest JSfewsU i
The State or Feeling. There is ovidently
pervading in all branches of the Government
a far more . hopefal fee,icg concerning, tlte
speedy termination 'and successful ' result of
tho present conflict than heretofore. In
reference to the British press, it is believed
that it will bo as earnest as our own in discus
sing the circumstances of the arrest of Mason
and Slidell, but no apprehensions are enter
tained that the question will be produciivo of
serious embarrassment to the two countries.
A Schooner Captcned. VThe British
Schooner Mabel has been taken into Port Roy
al. She purported to be from Havana to New
York, but was heading for St. Charles sound
when captured. She will be sent to Philadel
phia for adjudication, Her carge consisted
of 7 bales of blankets, 4 cases of cloih,3 boxes
of starch, 25 boxes tin, 120 bags of coffee 20
barrels of potatoes, 350 pigs of arrow root, one
case of pistol revolvers,2 cases cavalry swords
and two cases of stores.
' East Texsessee: The Richmond Dispatch
says, (among other good things,) that there
is "a band of three thousand marauders in the
mountains of east Tennessee, under Parson
Brownlow and .Major Gilham, who-are doing
more mischief than the Yankees in Kentucky,
but they will have to be stopped in their
treasonable movements, and we, think they
will be, as Gen. Lovell is after them with the
H ome. Guards Of Memphis and Knoxville.'
Good for the Parson. . '""
New Mexico. The call of the Gorernnijut
or New-Mexico for 12,000 militia men to gar
ri8on the different posts in the Territory has
been promptly responded to. The whole
number will in a short time be reported for
duty. At Santa Fe the merchants have re
solved to endorse for. the Government to any
amount that may be advauced to the territory
A light battery, commanded by Lieut. Ander
son, D". S. army, left Santa Fe for the South
James River. The steamer Cambridge
went up James river within sight of Cabin
Point; but saw no rebel batteries. She also
ran up the Warwick river about two miles
where Gen. Mansfield found a rebel regiment
encamped. A few shells from the Cambridge,
however, caused them' to decamp in "double
quick." The rebels appear to be scared at
the great influx of troops and vessels in the
vicinity of Fortress Monroe.
-Rebel Congressmen. The rebel "rump".
legislature of Missouri met at Neosho, but n t
having a quorum of members present, they
made up the number by appointing proxies; after
which they elected J. B. Clark and R. L."Y
Ileyton, Senators to the rebel Congress. This
is the first timo in the history of this country
that a legislative body lias transacted business
by proxy. Surely rebellion is a great "insti
tushun." ;
. A Reconnoisance. Col. Bavard. with 700
men of 1st Penn'a Cavalry reserve, made a
reconnoisance to Drainesville, and succeeded
in capturing eleven rebels, having killed two
and wounded ono of the enemy. Two of the
prisoners are cavalry with their horses, arms
and equipments. Col. Bayard and two others
were slightly wounded.
The Eastern Shore. Several rebel officers
were captured by bur troops in Accomac and
Northampton counties, Vn. , All traces of dis
loyalty seems to have disappeared. The peo
pie will adopt the State government for West
ern Virginia as a temporary measure, with! a
hope of being annexed to Delaware or Mary
land in the future.
Gen. Cass. This "gentleman has written a
corumunicationt the Detroit Free Press, in
which he justifies the arrest ol . Mason and
Slidell, and shows that it was in strict accor
dance with the position of government upon
the light of search question as maintained in
the coirespondence with the British Govern
ment iu 1858.
A Slave Regiment. The National Republi
can, printed in Washington, has advices from
Winchester, Virginia, that the rebel General
Jackwon commands a regiment of slaves, who
are fully armed. This forcing of "chatties"
to fight,, is rather a "black!' speck jn the
history of the rebellion.
Town Burned. The principal portion of
tho town of Warsasv, Missouri, was destroyed
by fire on the 21st. -Some of the Government
ston-s, for which there was no transportation
at hand, were also destroyed. " The fire is said
to be the work of incendiary Secessionists.
Capture of a Pirate. The pirate vessel.
Beauregard, has been captured by the U- S.
gunboat G. W. Anderson, of Boston, with 27
prisoners and one long pivot gun on her deck.
The pirate was laying at Key West, and made
no resistance. -
Pirates. The government of Italj has a-
dopte.d stringent measures in reference to the
piracy vessels , engaged in depredating n
America commerce. The American Consuls
are keeping a sharp lookout for suspicious
vessels. .'- :
The Rebel Capital. The. Richmond En
quirer says, the rebel Congress has passed a
bill for the removal o"f the Capital from Rich
mond .to Nashville, Tennessee. Truly these
rebels are & shifting set of rascals. - ? -
More Troops. Five hundred regulars from

Received by Tuesday Evening's IfaiL
Congress assembled on Monday. A quorum
of both Ilouses were present. In the House
a resolution was passed, expelling J. W. Ried,
a member from Missouri, for having taken up
arms against the United States. The . House
passed a vote of thanks to Capt. Wilkes for
his arrest of the traitors 11 a son and Slidell.
The rebels having confined Col. Corcoran as
a convicted felon, the House requested the
President to similarly confine J. M. Mason -also,'
to similarly confine John Slidell as a
hostago for Col. A. M. Wood of the lath N.
Y., who is confined in a felon's prison In the
South. The President's Message was to be
delivered at one o'clock on Tuesday. i ,
A report has been circulated that the rebel
steamer Nashville had captured the mail
steamer Arago, on which Gen Scott had taken
passage for Europe. This is doubtful, as the
Arago carries 4 rifled cannon of long range,
besides a large number of small arms, and can
be defended by a crew of 100 men.
It is reported that Col. Kerrigan, of late
the 25th N; Y regiment, has been tried by a
court martial for treason and sentenced to be
shot, and that his death warrant has been
signed by the President. Kerrigan is a mem
ber of Congress lrom New York city. '
Tho Secretary of the Navy approves of the
Capture of the rebel commissioners by Capt
Wilkes, and says he might have captured the
vessel bearing them.
The Tribitne''s correspondent saj-s, that at
the urgent request of Geo. D. Prentice, Gwin
and Benham have been released from Fort
Lafayette.
There are now 700,000 volunteers whose
services have been accepted by the United
States and the several States.
. A skirmish took place at Black . Walnut,
Missouri, In which 8 rebels were killed, 17
wounded and 6 captured.
The rebel steamer Page captured, on the
Potomac, two vessels laden with coal and
lumber. - .
A railroad train was seized by the rebels in
Missouri, but the money and mails were saved.
Nothing definite has been received reference
to the bombardment of Pensacola.

Nathaniel McOlosket, aged about 28 years
Deceased was a member of Company K. 1st

formation of our company at Curwinsville in
May last. The same social qualities that en
deared him to friends at home, have since
commanded our respect and esteem, and it is
with deep regret thai; we record Una the first
gloom that his fallen upon' us. A young man
zealous in the cause in which be was engaged,
of upright principles and correct habits ; we
feel his loss, and know that a brave spirit has
gone from our midst, leaving us the lesson,

Attention is especially called to this article, as
substitute for gold in inserting teeth. Many per
sons who have tr rd all kinds of metalic based pre
fer this, and in those cases where it is applicable,
it will in a great measure become a substitute for
gout, silver or platina. Its chief advantages are
cheapness, lightness and perfect adoption to the
mouth ; it having a soft fleshy feel to the parts of
tne moutu with wnich it comes in contact.
A.M. Hills is prepared to put up-teeth on the
Vulcanite Base, with Goodyear's Patent Gum,
which is the only reliable preperation, and can
only be had through their regular agents.. As
there are very many kinds of spurious crams in
use, of a very inferior quality it will be well for
persons desirous of procuring teeth on the V ulcan

sponsibility ot the JJentit they employ. ,.

TVTEW-YORK TRI BUHE NEW VOLUME
il On the seventh of September. 1861. THE
NEW-YORK WEEKLY TRIBUNE commenced the
twenty-first year of its existence; the THE DAI
LY THIBli -TB. being some months older and THE
SEMI-WEEKLY TRIBUNE somewhat younger.
For more than twenty years, this journal has la
bored in what its conductors have felt to be the
cause of Humanity, Justice and Freedom, endeav
oring to meliorate the condition of the oppressed
and unfortunate, to honor and encourage useful
exertion m whatever sphere, and. to promote by
all means the moral, intellectual and material ad
vancement of our country. It has aimed to be
right rather than popular, and to espouse and
commend to-day the truth that others may not be
willing to accept till to-morrow. Ib punning
this course, mistakes have doubtless been made
and faults committed ; but, having in all things
incited our readers to think and judge for them
selves rather than adopt blindly our own or oth
ers conclusions, we believe we may fairly claim
for this journal the credit of having qualified its
reaaera to ueiecc ana expose even its own errors.
To develop the minds of the young by the most
general, thorough and practical Education, and tt,
encourage and stimulate Productive Industry,
through free grants of Public Lands to actual set
tlers and cultivators, as also through the protec
tion of immature or peculiarly exposed branches
from too powerful foreign competition, areamog
tho aims to which thin journal has' adhered
through good and evil report, and which itstead-
fastly commends to American patriotism and
philanthropy. -
As to the Civil War now devastating our coun
try, we hold it to have originated in a Rebellion
more wanton, wicked, inexcusable, then was ev
er before known a Rebellion in the interest of
the few against the many a Rebellion designed
to raise higher the walls of caste and tighten the
chains of oppression. Having done all we could
without a surrender of vital principle to avoid
this War and witnessed the forbearance, meek
ness, and long-suffering with which the Federal
Government sought to Rvert its horrors, we hold
it our clear duty, with that of every other citizen
to stand by the nation and its fairly chosen ru
lers. and to second with all our energies their ef
forts to uphold the Union, the Constitution, and
the supremacy of the laws. And, though the Re
bellion has become, through usnrpation, deception,
terroism, and spoliation, fearfully strong, we be
lieve the American Republic far stronger, and
that the mnanimous, earnest efforts of loyal hearts
and hands will insure its overthrow. But on all
questions affecting the objects, the scope, and du
ration of this most extraordinary contest, we de
fer to those whom the American People have
clothed with authority, holding unity of purpose
and of action indispensable in so grave an emer
gency "" ' "
In a crisis like the present, our columns must
be largely' engrossed with the current history of
the War for the Union, and with elucidations of
its more striking incidents. We shall not. how
ever, remit ; that attention to Literature, to For
eign Affairs, to Agricultural Progress, to Crops,
Markets. tc which has already, we trust won for
THE TRIBUNE an honorable position among its
cotemporaries. " Oar main object is and shall be
to produce ' a comprehensive newspaper, from
which a careful reader may glean a vivid and
faithful history of the times, not merely in the do
main of Action but in that of Opinion also. As
our facilities for acquiring : information increase
with years, we trust that an improvement in the
contents ot our journal is perceptible, and that,
in the variety and fulness of intelligence afford
ed, we may still hope to make each day a critie
on the last." In this hope, we solicit a continu
ance of the generous measure of patronage hith
erto accorded to our journal.
