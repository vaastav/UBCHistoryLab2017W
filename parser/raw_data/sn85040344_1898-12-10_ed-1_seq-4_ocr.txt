PRESIDENT’S MESSAGE
A Critical Review of the War
with Spain.
NO POLICY OUTLINED.
Executive bays Wc Must Await Sign
ins of Treaty Before Dis
cussion Begins.
Washington, I*. C., Pee. s.—President
McKinley’s second annual message, sub
mitted to f'ongress today contains about
20.000 words. Following are the more
inqiortant features of the message.
To the Senate and House of Ilepres. n
tatives: Notwithstanding the added bur
dens rendered necessary by the war. our
people rejoice in a very satisfactory and
steadily-increasing degree of prosperity,
evidenced by the largest volume of busi
ness ever recorded. Manufacture has
been productive, agricultural pursuits
have yielded abundant returns, labor in
all fields of industry is better rewarded,
revenue legislation passed by the present
Congress has inert used the treasury’s re
ceipts to the amount estimated by it
authors; the finames of the government
have been successfully administer'd and
its credit advanced to the first rank,
while its currency has been maintained
at the world's highest standard. Military
service under a common flag and for a
righteous cause has strengthened the na
tional spirit and served to cement more
closely than ever the fraternal bonds be
tween every section of the country.
In reviewing the contmvei >y which led
up to the war with Spain, the President
takes up the thread of narrative where it
terminated in his !a-t message. He con
cluded: "It was hones.ly du** to our
friendly relations with Spain that she
should be given a reasonable chance to
realize her expectations of reform to
which she had become Irrevocably com
mitted."
It became evident, however, that the
proposed jilans were barren of good re
sults. No tangible relief was afforded the
reconcentrades. among whom the rate of
mortality frightfully increased, the prof
fered expedient of tunes of cultivation
proved illusory and it was apparent that
nothing save the physical exhaustion of
Spain or the Ilubans and the pur ties! min
of the island of t üba could result from
the struggle then in pro^re-s.
Destruction of the Mairtc.
At this critical juncture, the destruc
tion of the battleship Maine occurred.
Concerning it the President said; "It is
a striking evidence of the poise am!
sturtly g 1 nse dist aguish tg■ urn
tion.il i-haraeter that this sho king blow.
falling upon a generous pie, already
deeply touched by preceding events in
<’uba, did not move them to an instant,
kesperate resolve to tolerate no longer the
existence of an end of danger and di
order at our doors that made possibh
such a deed, by whomsoever wrought.'’
Ilesuming the war narrative, the Presi
dent directs attention to th< measures,
including tin soOJXhmsm) ilppropriati'iu
for national defense, taken to place th
country on a war footing, and adds: "It
is sufficient to say that the outbreak of
war. when it did come, found oar nation
not unprepared to meet the conflict.”
’ Reference is made to the apprehension
of coming strife by the continental pow -
ers, voiced in the address to the Pr-M
dent through their nnilias=adoi-5 and en
voys. and to the Presiiient's rt-lily ihere
i ■. Still unimatod. however, by the ho >.■
of a peaceful solution of the dirfietilty and
obeying the dictates of duty, the Presi
dent relaxed no effort to bring about a
spC'ily ending of the Cuban struggle.
Negotiations with the Madrid government
proved futile so far as practical results
were concerned, and then it was that
tie' President presented the question to
Congress, saying:
“In the name of humanity, in the name
i civilization, in behalf of endangered
American interests which give ns the
right and duty to speak, and to act. th
war in Cuba must stop,"
The result of this statement of the ca-.
was the adoption of the memorable join!
resolution by Congress, declaring the pur
pose of the United States to intervem
between the Spaniards and Cubans.
Following swiftly upon the enactment
af the resolution came the severance of
diplomatic relations between the two
■■■mntrb-s, the proclamation of a blockade
of Cuban ports, the call for volunteers,
and the formal declaration of the exist
ence of a state of war. All other govern
meats were immediately notified of the
existence of war and each proclaimed
neutrality.
"It is not among the least gratifying
:i cideuts of the strugg ■ that the obliga
tions of neutrality were impartially dis
charged by all. often under delicate and
difficult circumstances, - ’ remarks the
President.
Critical Review of the War.
The President reviews at length the
work of preparation f >r war, referring
particularly to the enlistment of the vol
unteers, to the material increase of the
navy in both men and ships an ! to the
precautionary measures taken for the pro
tection of the <a>>nboard coast and i itie>.
‘The aggregate humbe ■ of mines plac'd
was lo.'gj. at the principal barbers from
Maine to t ’alifnrnia."
Referring to "the dith tilt and imj rant
character" of the work performed by the
signal corps, the President. say<; "This
serviet was invaluabh to the exectnivi in
Invi ting the operations of the army and
navy. With a total force of over BJftO
the oss was by diseast. in ian ;
tic Id. officers and ncn included, only five."
A- to the authorized loan of ?200.0<>0.-
( NMt. which was taken entirely by -ran!!
bidders, the President says; “This v. - ~
most on ouraging and signifb aut res t.
showing the vast resources of die nation
uni the determination o' the people to n*
injld their country's honor."
Taking np ehronoJogii ally tin •x• nts- .t
he war. the President r< views • n in can
fully. The first encounter was the sat
Matai :as on Apri 27. This was
followed by an engagement which was
"dost nd to mark amt mi raMe ep
maritime warfare." This was I'tinupo
dore Dewey’s - ry a?

"It will be observed that while our navy
was engaged in two great battles and in
numerous perilous undertakings in block
ade and bombardment and more than 50,-
000 of our troops were transported to dis
tant lands and were engaged in assault
and siege and battle and many skirmishes
in unfamiliar territory, we 1 -st in Ixjtharms
of the service a total of I*l6B killed and
wounded; ar;d in the entire campaign by
land and sea we did not lose a gnn or a
Hag or a transport, or a ship, and with the
ei option of the crew of the Merriuiac,
not a soldier or sailor was taken prison
er."
I he President bears testimony and pays
fitting tribute “to trie patriotism and devo
tion of that large portion of our army
which, although eager to he- ordered to the
post of greatest exposure, fortunately was
not required outside of the United States.”
Ihe did their whole duty and earned
the gratitude of the nation. file Presi
dent then says: “In tracing those events
we are constantly reminded of our obli
gations to the Divine Master for His
watchful care over us and His safe guid
ance. for which the nation makes rever
ent acknowledgment and offer* humble
prayer for the continuance of His fa
vors.”
Peace Negotiations.
The peace negotiations which followed
soon after the capitulation of Santiago
and the preparation and signing of the
protocol are discussed at length. Re
ferring to the work of the peace commis
sioners in Paris the President says;
“These negotiations have made hopeful
progress, so that 1 trust soon to be able
to lay a definite t!*aty before tin- Senate
with a review of the steps leading to its
signature,
"I do not discuss at this time the gov
ernment tenure of the new possessions
which will < omi to us as the r* suit of
the war with Spain. Such discussion
will be appropriate after the treaty of
peace shall 1* - ratified. In the meantime,
and until the Congress has legislat* 1 th
erwise, it will be my dtitj to < mtinui tin
military governments which have existed
sin ■■ our occupation and givt to the peo
ple security in iife and property and en
couragement under a ju>l and beneficent
rule.
“As soon i- w< are in )■• shm of
' übu and have pacified the island it will
b- n, osary give aid and dir.* tiou to
its people 1., l*rm a g- -vermix-nt lor them
selves This sh ild 1 nndettaken at the
earliest moment consistent with safety
and assured su.-c,---. It is important that
our relations with this peoph shall be of
the most friendly character and our com
mercial relations close and reciprocal. 1:
should be our duty to assist in every
proper way to build up the waste places
of the island', encourage the industry •>!
the people and as-i-t them to form a gov
ernment which shall bo free and ind< -
pend* :.t. thus r* aliz .a the host a
tions of the < 'ubaii people.
“Spanish rule must bo replaced by a
just, b ncvolrnt and human.* government,
created bv the people of Cuba, capable
'f iwiforming all Internati< nal obligations
and which shall encourage thrift, industry
and prosperity and promote peace and
good-will among all of the inhabitants,
whatever may have be. n tlieir relations in
the pas*. Neither revenge tier passion
should have a place in the new govern
ment. Until there i~ complete tranquil.i
ty in the island and stable government in
augurated military • cciipatiou will be con
tinued.”
•tther i oieigu Relations.
The President says that with on ex
ception, the rupture with Spain, the in
tercourse ( ,f ih,* United States with tin
great family of nations during th* pa t
year has been marked with cordiality,
t'otic, i- ing negotiations with tin- Argen
tine government, initiated with a view
to removing differences* in cable rate
eharg. ' imposed against messages ask
ing from and to the United States, the
President expresses bis sillci-r* desire for
an international agreement whereby in
t • rehange ■ ■tuessages over ng
lines may b. regnlateil on ;t fair basis of
uniformity. and adds:
"it would be Miaiige wet * {lie nations

The Nicaragua Canal.
Tie President, expects that the Nica
ragua caii,,l commission will shortly I*
able to report finally, "I have not ix-si

President. "that eons!.!..rations of expedi

the several governments interested in the

occanic canal by this route require the
maintenance of the status quo until the
