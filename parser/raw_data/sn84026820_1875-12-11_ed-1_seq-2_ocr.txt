President Grant, in his seventh an
i - I» Pnnirross Tnps
noai mescag , g
day, indulges in some pleasant mention
of the advancement of our country from
its infancy tn its centennial, and of the
nation's great success io progress and
civilixation ; of its wonderful achieve
ments in arts, science and all the con
comitants of advanced betterment of all
the people And in this connection he
urges that all citizens should be educat
ed sufficiently to cast a vote with right
intelligence of the value of the elective
franchtsu, which is a proposition do
reasonable person will question, though
it was not acted upon in the reconstruc
tion policy of the President's own party.
The absence of such educated intelli
gence ia, the President thinks, the pri
mel dauger to our country's prosperity
and the permanence of its free institu
tiops, and in such belief he recommends
an amendment to the constitution re
uniting the several States to establish
and forever maintain free public schools
adeauateto at least, the rudimentary
education of all the children, irrespeo
tive of color, sex. nationality or relig
ion ; forbidding, however, the teaching
in such schools the inculcation of pagan
atheistic tenets, or the bestowal of
school funds to sny religious dénomma
tion for educational purposes. He also
obiects to the accumulation of vast
amounts of uotaxed church property,
and says that that class of property in
the United States in 1875 amounts to
$1.000,000,000. He recommends the
taxation of all such property, exempt
ing only cemeteries and limited edifices
for churches. . .
These subjects have always in this
country heretofore been regarded ns be
longiogp peculiarly to the State and
local governments, and at bo time have
they received more general and willing
attention in the States than at present.
Stating that our relations with for
eign power, « ,.ti,f«.or, ,.d fri.od.
ly, the President takes occasion to re
mark that Congress should so legislate
as to prohibit citizens of the United
o.nio. in mo ml,,,
States from owning slaves in any other
country, and he hopes such consomma
tion may ultimately embrace oitizens of
,11 nations.

^SATURDAY MORNING, DEC. 11, 1875.
Fearing that their days are numbered
and that the "Stewardship" is about to
be taken from them, the Republican
manipulators of the Government have
suddenly grown very economical, and
reducing the already small salaries
of the little officials but some how tbe
salaries of the greater ones are not re
duced a cent. The $400 salary of
oarsman at a coast station is cut down
$300 and a Night Inspector, who
paid $800 a year is now to set
$600, but tbe number af fast horses in
the President's stable is not lessened
and the nation must still pay $50,000
for his little indulgences.
Oca limited space forbidding the
publication -of the President's message
entire, we give an admirable and com
prehensive synopsis of it prepared by
the Baltimore Sun It will be found
to contain the substance of the whole
document and is very interesting,
many matters claimed space in
this week that we have been com
pelled to forego the publication] of a

pose, besides editorials on the Presi

The grasshopper plague is supposed
to have diminished the sale of public
Und« during the year, there being a
decrease in the sales of 2,459,601 acres
as compared with thoae of the previous
year. The surveyed area of public do
main is 680,253,094 acres, leaving
1.154,471,762 acres yet to be surveyed
The management and disposition of this
vast farm of "Uncle Sam" are recom
mended to the careful consideration of
Congress.
As to pensioners, the message states
that daring the past year 11,557 names
have been added to the payrolls and
12.977 dropped, showing a decrease of
1.420. But notwithstanding this de
crease of pensioners, there has been
increase in pay to the amount of $44,
733-13, which was induced by the
greatly increased average rate of pen
' allowed by the last Congress.
During the last fiscal year there was
paid for account of pensions $29.683,
116. There are on the rolls 234.821
persons, of whom 210.363 are army
pensioners, (of these 105,478 being in
valids.) and 104,885 are widows and
dependent relatives. The navy pen
sioners are 9.420, including 1,636 in
valids and 1.784 widows and dependent
relatives Of the war of 1812 there are
21,038 pensioners, 15.875 being sur
vivors and 5,143 widows. The amount
required for payment of pensions for
the next fiscal year is estimated tt
$29,535,000.
The President thinks his Indian po
licy has been prosecuted with encour
aging and satisfactory results as to the
improvement of the race, and he says !
the same policy will be continued with !
such modifications as maybe deemed j
er j
P As to the centennial exhibition the !
President thinks that ns it is to be an i
international affair, to which the United j
States government is only a voluntary
contributor, its contribution should be
large enough to sustain the dignity of
the United States in such a contingency.
He says that almost without exception ;
powers of Europe, the South Amer- ,
ican States, and even the far-off East- i
ern sovereignties have taken steps to
be represented in the centennial exhi
bition.

The money that Mr. Salmon is using
in the building of his house, has been

1 Our new .cbool system is beginning
to show its good effects under the effi

! is true that we have k few teachers io
our schools yet, who have no more in

as a general thing onr present public
an
«mm»
the
school system is a decided improvement I
over the old one. In my humble judg
ment the books selected by the State
Board (with very few exception.) are
far better than the old ones.
Miss Ella Simkins has charge of our
school, and has proven herself to be a
very competent teacher. She obtained
3 n.
an excellent certificate from ; Ir Gro c.,
and the commissioners were fortunate
in securin'» her service- A public ex

To all persons who were concerned

Philadelphia to Liverpool,:—There was

thousand crates of choice peaches,under

that the steerage compartment of said
steamer, was to be fitted-up by the said

thousand dollars. Upon the arrival
of the steamer at Liverpool Messrs
Peter Wright f Sons agents for said
line in Philadelphia, telegraphed to me,
a chairman of the committee, who had
bargained with said company, that our
pe.Shes were rotten on arrival, owing
to the supply of ice giving out on the
29th of August, just three daysahet ' the
ship sailed, and that, notwithstanding 1
tbe peaches were in first rate condition i
for four days after the ice gave Out,
(the 29th of August,) showing by this
admission of the company that Ihey
were solely to blame for- the failure and |
loss of the peaches, i therefore called
at their office once, tbey were not in or
dodged. I then wrote ; they replied, j
that Bates, the person who put iu^ the ,
refrigerator made the failure and imi- 1
mated we should look to him. I wrote ;
of back we had nothing to do with Bates; ;
that I had never seen him, nor did not i
wish to see him, that I bargained with
the aforesaid steamship company, and
that we held them responsible for the
failure, aud that if they would pay
It back to us tha money tbey had received
io of us, we would let the matter go.
They quibbled and refused to do it I
or then, to save further trouble, or I law !

The entire loss by this Steamship

peaches, at one dollar and a half a
crate, three thousand dollars, and two
thousand dollars cash, price to the com
pany as freight.
As much as has been said of the P.,
W. # & B. R. R. Co., the President of
it, Mr. Hinckley, as soon as ho heard of
the loss by the Steamship Company,
sent orders to each agent where said
peaches were shipped to pay the freight
back to each shipper. I wish each
shipper within ten days to signify in
writing what he has made up his mind
to do, either be a party in the suit or
transfer his sole right and interest to
some other shippar who has back bone.
No Railroad Company that the peach
shippers ever had dealings with ever

It is useless to attempt to cleanse a stream

complaints of the liver and kidneys, eruptions
of tbe skin, scrofula, headaches, and all di

removed by Dr. Walker's California Vinkgab
Bitters, the great and infallible purifier of tbe
