The message reviews In detail the siege,
giving maqj racis nunerto Known only ir

the march on. Pekln as follows;
Toward the end ot July the movement
began. A snvere conflict followed at Teln

The Matter of Indemnity
for our wronged citizens Is a question ol
grave concern. Measured In money alone,
a sufficient reparation may prove to be
beyond the ability of China to meet. All
the powers concur in emphatic disclaim
ers or any purpose of aggrandizement
through the dismemberm

Important of all, by the opening' of China
to the equal commerce of all the world.
These views have been and will be earn
estly advocated by our representatives.
The government of KuBsla has put for
ward a suggestion, that In the event of
protracted divergence of views In regard
to Indemnities the matter may be rele
gated to the court of arbitration at The
Hague. I favorably Incline to this, be
lieving that high tribunal could not fail
to reach a Solution no less conducive to
the stability and enlarged prosperity of
China Itself than be Immediately bene
uclal to the powers.
Other Foreign Matters.
Ratifications of a treaty 'of extradition
with the Argentine Itepubllc were ex
changed on June 2 last.
We have been urgently solicited by
Belgium to ratify the international con
vention of June, lSli. amendatory of the
previous convention of 18'.K in respect to
the regulation of the liquortrade In Af
rica. Compliance was necessarily with
held. In the absence of the advice and
consent of the senate thereto. The prin
ciple involved has the cordial sympathy
of this government.
In the interest of expanding trade be
tween this country and Pouth America,
efforts have be.-n made during the past
year to conclude conventions with the
southern republics for the enlargement
of postal facilities.
The message devotes considerable space
'to the Paris Exposition, the difficulties
:met with. Irs development of good-will
between the United States and France
; and Its effect on exportations. He praises
the enterprise of American exhibitors and
shows their success by their awards aa
follows: Crund prizes, -240; gold medals,
697; silver medals. 776; tironze medals, 541,
and honorable mentjKMiH. 3222,476 In all,
being the greate-st tetal number gtven

as well as the largest number In each

Germaar Jill night.
Good-will prevails In our relations with
the German empire. An amicable adjust
ment of the long pending question of the
admission of our life Insurance companies
to do business In Prussia has been reach
ed. One of the principal companies has
already betn readmitted and the way
Is opened for the tothers to share the priv
ilege. The settlement of the Samoan problem,
to which I adverted In my last messace,
has accomplished good results. Peace and
contentment prevail in the Islands.
An Imperial meat Inspection law has
been enacted for'Oermany. While tt may
simplify the Inspections, it prohibits cer
tain products nretofore admitted. There
is still great uncertainty as to whether
jut well-nlgn "extinguished Oermiw trade
In meat products can revive under its
sew burdens. 3uch will depend upon reg
ulations not yet promulgated, which we
confidently nxipe'wlll be free from the dis
criminations which attended the enferoe

Great '.Britain Friendly
Our friendry relations with Great Brit
ain continue. The war in Southern Afri

dition unusual In International wars was
presented tn 'that while one belligerent
had control CfJthe seas, the other had no
ports, shipping or direct trade, but was

liter Oean Canal.
The sll-lmportant matter of an Inter
ocennlc canal has assumed a new phase.
AdhTlng to its refusal to reopen the
question of the forfeiture of the contract
f the Maritime Cans Co., which was
germinated for alleged non-execution In
October, 1&9. the government of Nicara
gua haa slno0 supplemented that action
by declar'rg the so-styled Fyre-Cragln
option void for non-payment of the stlpu
Nted advance. Protests Is relation to

senute the convention with Great Britain
to facilitate the construction of such a
canal and to remove any objection which
might arise out of the convention com
monly called the Clayton-llulwer treaty.
Affairs With Spain.
Satisfactory nroExess has been made
toward the conclusion of a g

of friendship and Intercourse with Spain.
in replacement of the old treaty, which
passed into abeyance by reason of the late
war. A new convention of extradition la
approaching completion, and I should be
much pleased were a commercial arrange

not suffer to pass any opportunity to re
affirm the cordial ties that existed be
tween us and Hpain from the time of our
earliest independence, and to enhance the
mutual bent fits of that commercial Inter
course which Is natural between the two
countries.
PanAinerlcan Exposition.
The exposition of the resources and
products of the western hemisphere, to
be held at Buffalo next year, promises
Important results not only for the United
States but for the other participating
countries. It is gratifying that the Latin-American
states have evlsced the live
liest Interest and the fact that an Inter
national American congress will be held
In the City of Mexico while the exposi
tion Is In progress encourages the hope
of a larger display at Buffalo than might
otherwise be practicable. The work of
preparing an exhibit of our national re
sources Is mnklng satisfactory progress
under the direction of different officials
of the federal government and the vari
ous states of the union have shown a dis
position toward the most liberal partici
pation in the enterprise. t
CestUI tlon of Revenues.
It Is gratifying to be able to state that
the revenues for the fiscal year ended
June 30. IWO. wtre J79,527.0t.18. For the
six preceding years we had only deficits,
the aggregate of which from 1S04 to 1S!)9,
Inclusive, amounted to $iS3,022,991.14. The
receipts for the year from all sources,
exclusive of postal revenues, aggregated
$57.240,Kl.i;t. and expenditures for all
purposes, exce.pt for the administration
of the postal department, aggregated
4S7.713,71tl.71. The receipts from customs
were $233,164,871.16, an Increase over the
preceding year of $27,036,389.41. The re
ceipts from internal revenue were $203.
J27.'J2C.76, an increase of $21,890,765.25 over
1899. The receipts from misctllaneous
sources were $8,743,063.97, as against $36.
894.976.92 for the previous year.
It is gratifying also to note that during
the ve.ir a considerable reduction is
shown In the expenditures of the govern
ment. The war department expenditures
for the fiscal year 1900 were $134,774,767.78,
a reduction of $93,066,486.69 over those of
1899. In the navy department the expen
ditures "were $55,953,077.72 for the year 1900,
as against $03,942,104.25 for the preceding
year, a decrease of $7,9S9.02.53. In the
expenditures on account of Indians there
was a decrease In 1900 over 1899 of $2.
'630,604.38; and in the civil and miscella
neous expenses for 1900 there was a re
duction of $13,418,065.74.
The secretary of the treasury estimates
that the receipts for the current fiscal
year will aggregate $580,000,000, and the ex
penditures $500,000,000, leaving an excess
of revenues over expenditures of $80,000.
OA. The present condition of the treas
ury 'Is one ot undoubted strength. The
available cash balance Nov. 20 was $139.
$03,794.50. it ! worthv of mention that the greater
number of banks being organized under
the new law are In sections where the
ased of banking facilities has been most
pronounced. Iowa stands first, with 36
'bank 8 ot the smaller class, wbUe Texas,
-Oklahoma. Indian Territory ana tne nna
die and western sections of the country
have also availed themselves largely of
'the privileges under the new law.
The party In power Is committed te
.such legislation as will better make the
currency responsive to tne varying neeu
-of business at all seasons and In all sec
'tlnna
tiur foreign trade shows a remarkable
record of commercial ana inaustnai prog
ress. The total of Imports and exports for
the first time In the history or tne coun
try exceeded two billions of dollars. The
exports are greater thaa they have ever
been before, tne total ior tne nscai year
MOO being $1.394,4S3.
Rea-ardlngr Onr Bonds.
The law of March 14. 1900, provided for
refunding Into 2 per tjnt tnirty-year
bonds. Davable. Drlncioal and Interest, 1
gold coin of the present .standard value
that nurtion of the Dublic debt represent
ed by the 3 per cent bonds of 1908, the 4
rer cents of 19J7. and the 5 per cents ot
1904, of which there was outstanding at
the date or said law isjm.iw.sju. ine noiu
ers of the old bonds presented them foi
exchange between March 14 and Ngvem
ber 30 to the amount of $364,943,750. The
net saving to the government on these
transactions aggregates ,iwuw.
Another effect of the operation, as stat
ed bv the secretary is to reuuee ine
cr-nrpe upon the treasury for the payment
of interest from the dates of refunding to
February 1, IM4. by the sum or more than
seven million dollars annually, from en
ruary 1. 11X14. to July 1. 1907, the annual in
terest charge will be reduced by the sum
of more than live millions, and for the
thirteen months ending August 1, 1908, by
about one million. The full details of the
refunding are given in the annual report
Of the secretary of the treasury.
The benelicial effect of the financial act
of 1900, so far as it relates to the modi
fication 01 tne national tanning act, 1
already apparent. The provision for the
Incorporation of national banks with a
caD ta of not less tnan i.vuo la places
not exceeding three thousand Inhabitants
has resulted in the extension of banking
facilities to many small communities hlth
erto unable to provide themselves with
banking Institutions under the national
system- There were organized from the
enactment of the law up to and Including
November 30, 369 rational banks, of whloh
168 -were with capital lens than $50,000, and
103 with a capital 01 ju.ihju or more.
Manufactures aad Imports.
The .growth of msnufactures In the
United States is evidenced by the fact
that exports of manufactured products
largely exceed those of any previous year,
their value ror 1900 being $433,851,756.
against $339,592,148 In 1899, an Increase of
Stf per cent.
Agricultural products were also export
ed during 1900 in greater volume than In
1899. the total for the year being $835,S3$.-

Iteduce the War Tax.
I recommend that the congress at Its
pretint session reduce the Internal rev
enue taxcq Imposed to meet the expenses
Of the war with Spain In the sum of thir
ty mi. 1:0ns or dollar. This reduction
houM -e secured by the remission of
those taxes which experience has shown

tr1p of the people.
I specially urge that there be Incl ided
In whatever reduction Is made the legacy

might be found to exist In connection with

In all the forms of government and ad

should bear In mind that the government
which they are establishing is designed
not for our satisfaction, or for the ex

Delagroa Bay Award.
The long standing contention with Port
ugal, growing out of the seizure of th
JJelagoa Bay railway, has been at last de
termined by a favorable award of the tri
bunal of arbitration at Berne, to which
it was submitted. The amount of th
award, which was deposited ir. London
awaiting arrangements by the govern
ments of the United States and Oreal
Britain for its disposal, has recently been
paid over to the two governments.
A lately signed convention of extradi
tion with Peru as amended by the senate
has been ratified by the Peruvian con-
Anothcr Illustration of the policy of thl
government to refer International dis
putes to Impartial arbitration is seen in
the agreement reached with Kussia to

American Vessels.
American vessels during the past three
years have curried uoout nine per cent ol
our exports ana imports, foreign snips
should carry the least, not the greatest,
part of American trade. The remarkable
growth of our steel Industries, the prog
ress et shipbuilding for the domestic
trade, -und Our stead. iy maintained expen
ditures for the navy have created an on
portunity to place the United States in
the first rank of commercial maritime
powers.
Besides realizing a proper national as

of a distinctive national industry, expand

of labor acri capital. It will Increase the
transportation facilities and reduce
freight charges on the vast volume ol
products brought from the interior to the
seaboard for export, and will strengthen
an arm of the national defence
Again urging Immediate action by the
congress on measures to promote Amerl
can shipping and foreign trade, I direct
attention to the recommendations on the
subject In previous messages, and panic
ularly to the opinion expressed in thi
message of 1899:
I am satisfied the Judgment of the
country favors the policy of aid to our
merchant marine, which will broaden our
commerce and markets and upbuild our
Aea-i:u.rryins capacity ior the products of

several Questions Settled.
The convention signed May 24, 1897, for
the final settlement of clulms left in
abeyance upon the dissolution of the
commission of 1S'J3. was at length ratified
by the Chilean congress and the supple
mental commission has been organized.
It remains for the congress 10 appro
priate for the necessary expenses of the
commission.
The insurrectionary movement which
disturbed Colombia in the latter part of
1899 has been practically suppressed, al
though guerillas still operate in some de
partments. The executive power of that
republic changed hands in August last by
the act of Vice-I'resldent Marroquln In
assuming the reins of government dur
ing the absence of President San Clem
cnte from the capital. The change met
with no serious opposition, and, follow
ing the precedents In such cases, the
United States minister entered into rela
tions with the new de facto government
on Sept. 17.
It is gratifying to announce that the

A Cable Needed.
I renew the recommendation made in
my special message of Feb. 10, 1899, as to
the necessity for cable communication
between the United States and Hawaii,
with extension to Manila. Since then
circumstances have strikingly empha
sized this need. Surveys have shown the
entire feasibility of a chain of cables

National CeleLrnt l.n.
The congress, hav.i.fc .dtd for "an
appropriate national cei.tuulon of the
centennial annl usury . me establish
ment of the sent m government in the
District of Co.uinbla," trie committees
authorized by it have prepared a pro
Cram for the 12th of December, 1900,
which date has been selected as the an
niversary day. Deep interest has been
shown In the arrangements for the cele
bration by the members of the commit
tees of the senate and house of repre
sentatives, the committee of governors
appointed by tlie president, and the com
mittees appointed by the citizens and In
habitants of the District of Columbia
generally. The program. In addition to
a reception and other exercises at tho
executive mansion, provides commemor
ative exercises to be held Jointly by the
senate and house representatives In the
hall of the house of representatives, and
a reception In the evening at the Cor
coran Gallery of Art In honor of the gov-

Onr Territories.
The attention of the congress is called
to the report of the secretary of the In
terior touching the necessity for the fur
ther establishment of schools In the ter
ritory of Alaska and favorable action is
Invited thereon.
Much intensMng Information Is given
in the report of the governor of Hawaii
as to the progress and development of
the islands during the period from July
7, 1898, the date of the approval of the
joint resolution of the congress provid
ing for their annexation, up to April 30,
1900, the date of the approval of the act
providing a government for the territory,
and thereafter.
The Inst Hawaiian census, taken In the
year 18. gives a total population of 109.
030. of which 31.019 were native Hawnllans.
The number of Americans reported was
8.4S5. The results of the federal census,
taken this year, show the Islands to have
a total population of 154,001, showing an
Increase over that reported in 1896 of 44,
881. or 41.2 per cent.
There has been marked progress in-the
educational, agricultural and railroad de
velopment of the Islands.
in the territorial act or April 30, 1900,
section 7 of said act repeals chapter 34
of the civil laws of Hawaii, whereby the
government was to assist in encouraging
and developing the agricultural resources
of the republic, especially Irrigation. Ths
governor of Hawaii recommends legisla
tion looKing to tne development of such
water supply as may exist on the nub
lie lands with a view of promoting land
settlement. The earnest consideration
of the congress is Invited to this Import
ant recommendation ana others, as em
bodied In the report of the secretary of
tne interior.
Co bit nnd Porto Illco.
The civil government of Porto Rico rro
vlded for the act of the congress aDDroved
April 12, 1900. In successful operation. The
courts have been established. The gov
ernor and his associates working Intelll
gently and harmoniously are meeting
with comrmndable success.
On the 6th of November a general elec
tion was held in the island for members
of the legislature and the body elected
has been caued to convene on the first
Monday of December.
I recommend that legislation be en
acted by the congress conferring upon
the secretary of the Interior supervision
over the public lands In Porto lllco, and
that he be directed to ascertain the loca
tlon and quantity of lands the title to
which remained In the crown of Spain at
the date of cession of Porto Rico to the
United States, and that appropriations
necessary ror surveys be made, and that
the methods of the disposition of such
lands be proscribed bv law.
The president says of Cuba that an elec
tion has been held and deleates elected
to hold a convention at Havana Nov. 1
to Adoot a constitution for the Island.
That convention ts now In session and Its
conclusions will be tent to congress as
oon as reached.
The Standing Army.
The present strength of the ramy Is
100.000 men 4B.00O regulars and 36.000 vol
unteers. Vnder the act of March 2, 1899,
tn the 30th of June the present volunteer
lores will be discharged and the regular
Irmy will be reduced to 2,447 officers and
1,026 enlisted men.
We have In Cuba between S.eOO and 1,000
troops. For the present our troops In
that Island cannot be withdrawn or ma
terially diminished, snd certainly not un
til the conclusion of the labors of ths con
stitutional convention now In session and
1 government provided by the new con
stitution shall have been established aud
its stability assured.
In Porto Rico we have reduced ths ear.
rlsons to 1,636, which Includes 879 native
troops. There Is no room for further rs
Suction here.
We will be required to keen a con! A.
treble force In the PhlllODlne Islands f
some time to come. From the best In
formation obtainable, we will need there
ror ths Immediate future from 45,000 to
10.000 men. I am sure the number mav
e reduced ns the Insurgents shall come
to acknowledge the authority of the
United States, of which there are assur
or inuicauons
It
must be apparent that we will ra.
julre an army of about 60,ono, and that
luring present conditions In Cuba snd
:he Philippines the president should have
authority to Increase the fcrce of the
(resent number of 100,000. Included in.
t.i!t number authority should be given to
1. i.s native troops ,n the Philippines up
to 15.0UO. which the Taft commission be
lieve will b more effective in delecting
and suppressing guerillas, assassins, snd
Ladrones than our own soldiers.
There are flfty-ebzhi or more military
rsts in the United States other than ths
coast defense forttticutlons.
The number of these posts Is being con
stantly Increased by the congress. More
than $22,000,000 have -been expended in
building and equipment and they can only
be cared for by the regular army. The
posts now In existence and others to be
built provide for accommodations for, and
If fully garrisoned require, 25,000 troops.
Many of these posts are along our fron
tier or at Important strategic points, the
occupation of which is necessary.
The Postal Service.
The continued and rapid growth of the
postal service Is a sure index of the great
and Increasing business activity of the
country. Its most striking new develop
ment Is the extension of rural free deliv
ery. This has come almost wholly within
the last year. At the beginning of the
fiscal year 1S99-19U0 the number of routes
In operation was only 391, and most of
these hud been running less than twelve
months. On the 15th of November, 1900,
the number had Increased to 2, (ill. reach
ing Into forty-four states and ierrlto--
and serving a population of 1,801,524. The
number of applications now peuuuig and
awaiting action nearly equals all those
f ranted up to the present time, and by7
he close of the current fiscal year about
4,000 routes will have been established,
providing for the daily delivery of mails
at the scattered homes of about three and
a half milions of rural population.
This service ameliorates the Isolation of
farm life, conduces to good roads, and
quickens and extends the dlst-cmlnatlon
of general information. Exper -nee thus
far has tended to allay the ap. rehenslon
that it would be so expensive a;- to forbid
Its general adoption or make It a serious
burden. Its actual application has shown
that It Increases postal receipts, and can
be accompanied by reductions in other
branches of the service, so that the aug
mented revenues and the accomplished
savings together materially reduce the
net cost.
Pensions nnd Patents.
At the end of tho tUcai year there were
on the pens-ion roil 9: 3,529 uamrs, a net
tr.frfvi.iu nf ' mil ,,aw t .U (i.-...,l ,nun leu-.
The number added to the rolls during the
year was 45,344. The amount disbursed for
army pensions during the year was $134.
700,597 U and for navy pensions $3,761,633 41,
a total of $138,402,130 G5, leaving an unex
pended balance of $5,512,768 & to be cov
ered Into the treasury, which shows as in
crease over tho previous year's expendi
ture of $107,077 70. There were 084 names
added to the rolls during the year by spe
cial acts passed at the first session of the
fifty-sixth congress.
The act of May 9, 1930, among other
things, provides for an extension of In
come to widows pensioned under taid act
to $250 per annum. The secretary of the
interior believes that by the operrMons of
vhls act the number of persons p .isloned
under It will Increase and the increased
annual payment for pensions wli: be be
tween $3,000,000 and $4,000,000.
The government Justly appreciates the
services of its soldiers and sailors by Bask
ing pension payments liberal beyond pre
cedent to them, their wldcws and orpba if.
There were 2640 letters patent granted.
Including re-Issues and designs, during th
fiscal year ended June 80, 1900; 1,660 trade
marks, 682 labels, and 93 prints registered.
The number of patents which expired was
19,988. The total receipts for patents w re
$1,358,228 36. The expenditures were ' ' -147,827
68, showing a surplus of $110,400 77. '
Naval Affairs.
Very efficient service has been rendered1
by the navy in connection with the Insure
rection In the Philippines and the recent
disturbance In China.
A very satisfactory settlement haa been1
made of the long pending question of ths
manufacture of armor plats. A reason-'
able price has bsen secured and the ne
cessity for a government armor plant
avoided.
Public Lands. '
The total area of public lands as given
by the secretary of the interior, Is approx
imately 1,071,861,662 acres, of which 917.
135,80 acres are undisposed of and 154
746,782 acres have been reserved for vari
ous purposes. The public lands disposed

the sale of public lands during the fiscal
year were $4,379,758.10, an increase of $1,
8.C2D 76 over the preceding year.
'i iie results obtained from our forest
policy have demonstrated Its wisdom and
the necessity In the interest of the public
for its continuance and Increased appro
priations by the congress for the carrying
on of the work. On June 30. 1900, there
were 37 forest reserves, created by presi
dential proclamations under section 24
of the act of March 3, 1891, embracing an
area of 46.425.529 acres.
During the past year the Olympic re
serve, In tho state of Washington, waa
reduced 2(T.040 acres, leaving Its present
area at 1.923,340 acres. The Prescott re
serve in Arizona, was Increased from 10,
240 acres to 423.6S0 acres, and the Big
Horn reserve, in Wyoming, was Increased
from 1.127,680 acres to 1. 180,800 acres. A
new reserve, the Santa Ynez. In Califor
nia, embracing an area of 115.000 acres,
was created during this year. On Oc
tober 10, 1900. the Crow Creek forest re
serve, In Wyoming, was created,
The Recent Census.
The president states that matters in
connection with the 12th census are pro
gressing favorably. He says the popula
tion of Hawaii Is 154,001. an Increase of
44.981 In four years. KeKardins- th iiniH
States bulletins are being Issued as rap
Idly as possible.
The department of agriculture has been
extending Its work during the past year,
reaching farther for new varieties of
seeds and plants; co-operating more fully
with the states and territories In re
search along useful lines; making prog
ress in meteorological work relating to
lines of wireless telegraphy and forecasts
for ocean-going vessels; continuing In
quiry as to animal disease; looking Into
the extent and character of food adul
teration: outlining plans for. the care,
preservation and intelligent harvesting
of our woodlands; studying soils that
producers may cultivate with better
knowledge of conditions, and helping to
clothe desert places with grasses suitable
to our arid regions. Our Island possesions
are being considered that their peoples
may . be helped to produce the tropical
products now so extensively brought Into
the United States. Inquiry into methods
of Improving' our roads has been active '
durlng'the year; help has been given to
many localities, nnd scientific Investiga
tion of material in the states and terri
tories has been Inaugurated. Irrigation
problems In our seml-arld regions are re
ceiving careful and Increased considera
tion. An extensive exhibit at Paris of th
products ot agriculture has made the peo
ples 01 many luuiunes more familiar
with the varied products of our nirt
and their comparative excellence.
Various Matters.
The president recommenda an amanrf.
ment to the alien labor law and the 8
hour law, and states that he has Instruct
ed the Philippine commission to inau-
guarate civil service examinations on the
isianas. ne says a good word for the .
proposed hall of public records and thinks
there should be a separate build In for
the archives of the nation. He closes
with the following Injunction for econ
amv In government expenditures:
In our great prosperity we must sroard
against the danger It Invites of extra- -vagance
In government expenditures and
appropriations: and the chosen represen
tatives or the people will. I doubt not,
furnish an example la their lesls.atlon
of that wise economy which In a season
or plenty husbands ror the future. In
this era of great business activity and
opportunity caution Is not untimely. It

It will not retard, but promote leglti

temptations and perils requiring constant -vigilance

to Invite conflicts, nor fer oppression,
