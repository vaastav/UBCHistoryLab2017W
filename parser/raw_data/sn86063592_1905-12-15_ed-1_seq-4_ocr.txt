Chicago editor who found two split
Infinitives In the president's message.
The Boston editors began ft search, at
once, but Boston Is considerably' slow

yetl of triumph would have gone ud If
those split Infinitives had been found
in Boston first.

After reading Secretary Boneparte's
desire to dlsporo of obsolete vessels
.and his suggestion that the old frig
ate Constitution be sent to her grave
by the guns of the North Atlantic
fleet, we can sympathize with the na
val officers who see in the secretary's
recommendation, that many officers
either be "dropped" or "compulsively
retired" 1 only a polite expression of
his desire to shoot them out of the
flJiTice, ,;.'

' In tils letter of congratulation last

head of the American people" Un

no other president has ever made
that claim. Perhaps our ambassa

rd to have successfully defended his
title to be called the "American am

Roosevelt Is heatf of the American

The large republican majority ln
the new congress may prove of less
party advantage than at first would
Liuwr. It fiords teeming eitenw-
fttlon for manY to. rely 'on the rest.'
a condition tbrt gives a frewa mon
orlty lender wfth ft welltulsed fob
lowing msny'an opportunity to mak
party and nolltlcal capital. That
democratic leaders . ire even now
ltaenly ftllve to ttiU act is apparent
and thHr pronounced advocacy of so
many of tho presld ntV policies ha
made many Republican veterans aus
pert danger. , , . .
Nearly every newspaper In the ter
ritory has shown up the Albuinerqtil
.Journal lately for Ha false fttatemcnts,
Its wobbling policy and Ua stupid and
unfounded attacks upon New Mexico
tnen and New Mexico Institutions and
buslners enterprises. The - Jonrnal
brought the showing up upon Hself.
The editor doesn't rellKh'lt t Isn't
surprising thst one whose mental
calibre Is of nch ft degenerate quali
ty as to allow him to sanction such
a policy as the' Journal has been
guilty of, should gft msd whfn.he Is
called down. H mny ierbnps be
pardoned for getting angry, as he has
been most thoroughly lambasted!.. Put
when he allows his n-to Induce

alltlea. he merely pleads guilty to low
tlrth and Indifferent breeding, which
show to quite as poor advantage In
newspaper as In private life.
THE PUBLIC LIBRARY.
Interest In the public library seems
to be Increasing. Of roure, here,
as elsewhere, there are "knockers" to
be found always , ready to writleUe,
generally without caue, but often
from pre-concved prejudice, or from
the habit of finding fault, which seems
to run In the blood with some people.
Such persons can never be pleatd
If the sun shines they complain that
It Is too hot; If clouds come they
want sunhlne, and so on to the end
of the calendar of wos they carry
about for public exhibition at oppor
tune times. But the fc-rat body of
the public, the men and women ho
build towns and cities, who promote
enterprises for the benefit of the com
munity where they live, to use a slang
phrase, "are not built that may," and
to such It Is ft source of real pleasure
to note the progress of all Institu
tions, religious, humane or education
al for the' betterment of mankind.
The records of the librarian show
that for November 1237 books were
loaned and read. maiy of i hern by
boys and girls from twelve to twenty
years cf age, thus introducing into
numerous families wholesome Influ
ences. Many ft Loy and girl will ac
quire a taste for reading from the
opportunities of this library. Dozens
of mothers In Las Vegas are rejoicing
that there Is a place where their
children may go for a llesure hour
under healthy moral and literary con
ditions. As some evidence of the growing
popularity of the library it may be
stated that 12S7 persons vlHited ttio
I library last month.' This Is an aver
age of over forty per day, many of
I whom remained for hours reading
books, magazines and newspapers.
Recognizing the value of such an
Institution, a large number of ladles
met some time ago at the library
building and took preliminary steps
to make a perfect organization.
Yesterday there waa ft further meet
ing at which a constitution was adopt
ed, officers elected, and the organ
ization perfected. The following la
dies signed ' the constitution ; Mrs.
Vollmer, Mrs.' McCIanahan, Mrs. Har
riet Van Petten, Mrs. W.R.Tlpton, Mrs.
Dillon, Mrs. .Larkln, Mrs. Ryan, Mrs.
Will Rosenthal, Mrs. S. C. Long, Mrs.
Clark, Mrs. Hsydon, Mrs. J. F. Brewer.
The Optic congratulate the public
upon the organization 'of this new as
sociation to work ' In the Interest of
the library, for -Its growth and up
building and to widen!, and - broaden
the sphere of Us Influence. ,
These women and the object for
which they are wbrklng are . entitled
to the earnest support of Las . Vegas.
With the cooperation of , the city
council and the library board they
will make the library a positive force
for the public good. ' . . " t : .
-, The beautlAll assembly hall at the
library building, with Ts bright sun
light during, the day and electric light'
Ing In the evening, wtTh books, peri
odicals and newspapers, is ft pleasant
place to which ' our young people
should be encouraged to go.
Later a further meeting will beheld
and the membership Increased. It is.
the wish of the women in this move
ment to enlarge the membership, and
their hope that the ladlea of Las Ve
gas may generously . Join In this Im
portant work.
Special Invitations? will not be ex
tended, Jjut all who feel an Interest
In this work will be expected to be
present at the next meeting, of which
due notice will be given.

We -very heartily agree with the
cordial expressions that, are. being
made In the territorial press regard
ing the re appointment of Jndge J. R.
McKle and- Judge Frank W. Parker.
Judge ' McFle has served for three
terms and Judge Parker for two, an
both have added lustre and distinc
tion to the New Mexico bench. Their
tenure of office has been marked by
Industry, Intelligence and a sincere
effort to do Justice to every Individ

CURED BY CUTiCURA
IN TWO WEEKS
Mrs. Georx e J. Steese, of 701 Cobnrn
St., Akron, Ohio, tells in the following
letter of another of those remarkable
curts of torturing, disfiguring skin
humors daily made by Cuticura Soap,
spitted by Cuticura Ointment,
fter physicians, sad all else had
failed: "I feel it my duty to parrnU
of other poor suffering babies to ti ll
vou what Cuticura has done for mr
little daughter. She broke out all
over her body with a humor, and we
uitcd everything recommended, but
without remits. I called in three doc
tors, they all claimed they could help
her, but she continued to grow worse.
Her body wss a mass of sores, and her
little face was eaten awav, ber cars
looked st if tbey would drc of.
Neighbors advised me to get ra
Soap and Ointment, and before 4 ..a 1
used half of the cake of, soap and
box of ointment the sores had. all
healed, and my little one's face and
body was st clear as s new-born babe's.
I would not be without it again if it
cost five dollars, instead of seventy-five
cents, which is all it cost us to cure
our baby, after spending many dollars
on doctors and medicines without any
benefit whatever."

I THE
110 II!
If all statehood legislation fails at
this session, It will be tire Jorst and
not the' woar&te statehood advocates
that will, be to blame. If a7l' the peo
ple of New' Mexico 'had gotten to
gether on a separate stafeflood' plat
form) thofr wishes would nbt' hsrve
been disregarded. There-1 la art nn
doubted' majority now' in he lower
house, for separate statehood: More,
unanimity of effort onxtUe" $krt of to
people of tnfgi'territoyy 'wj&iid' have
made certain a majority lrf the sen
ate. As it ! the struggle' wlir be
hard and the result is doubtful. Ari
zona has shown so strongfy' that she
doesn't want Joint statehood,' that ft
does " not seem likely she , win be
forced Into the union with this terri
tory, ' J V
Because of the activity of the Joint
statehooders, who do not represent
the sentiments of a quarter of the
people of this territory, there la an
impression In Washington that New
Mexico Is anxious to accept joint
statehood. While there Is a possi
bility that New Mexico may be taken
and Arizona left. It Is quite likely that
both states will oe omitted. If the
Joint statehood people had united with
the separate statehood advocates and
worked as hard for separate admission
as tbey have for Jointure, there would
have been no danger of such an ont
' in
come.
