Approval of the Imperial Parlia

(By The Associated Press)
LONDON, Dec. 6. "The centurles
old quarrel between England and Ire
land was ended a had been frequent
ly hoped in the small hours of Tues
day morning, by the signature in the
prime minister's cabinet room of "a
treaty between Great Britain and Ire
land," consisting of eighteen articles,
giving Ireland the title of the Irish
Free State, and the sarao constitu
tional status as Canada, Australia and
other overseas dominions.
Tho question of allegiance which up
to the last moment threatened to
wreck the negotiations was surmount
ed by permitting tho members of the
Irish patllment to swear allegiance to
tho constitution of the Irish Free State

King."
Tho treaty has yet to run the gaunt
lot f the Ulster government and of
the imperial parliament. Tho imper-
ial parliament has been summoned to
meet on December 14. and will be open
ed by tha king, who has taken the
lonest personal interest in tho Irish
;ir'.itlatloti since he practically Insti
gated them when he opened tho Ulster
parliament.
Approval by the imperial parliament
is a foregone conclusion, as the gov
s riuix-nt has an overwhelming. majority
in tho houso of common fayoring its
Irish policy, and the action of tho
Isiiiinn 1 eprtventatlves in reaching the
agreement has already been unani
mously endorsed by the cabinet. The
position of Ulster is less certain. Evi
dence comes from Belfast tonight that
the treaty will be biibjected to the most
xcavchlng examination before receiv
ing assent and doubtless many modifi
cations will bo proposed.
The king hastened to send the prime
minister a telegram congratulating
him on tho success, of the negotiations
and declaring 'I am overjoyed to hear
tho splendid news." tine king will
tome to London purposely tomorrow
to preside over the privy council to
approve tha proclamation summoning
parliament, as the constitution re
qiii.es a six uays' notice by the royal
proclamation. -,
Tho treaty was signed by all the
members of the British and Irish dele
gations participating In tho negotiation-!,
tho Irish delegates signing their
Gaelic names.
Ireland is treated as a singlo entity
in the provisions of tho treaty, with
special clauses providing against tho
possibility that Ulster should refuro j
acquiescence In the settlement, In
which easo the government of Ire
land, act of J2.0, will remain in force
so far as the northern parliament is
ooncernod. but with tho stipulation
that a special commission shall de
termine new boundaries for northern
Ireland.
Provisions a! are made for the co
operation of the two parliaments in
providing certain safeguards in the
event of Ulster remaining out of the
unv free state. Neither parliament,
however, will be permitted under the
treaty to make laws " endowing any
particular religion, or to Impose any
i-eliglous disability. The treaty looks

BY A COMMISSION IS PROPOSED
BY PRESIDENT IN HIS MESSAGE
President Harding Given Hearty
Reception By One of Largest
Audiences Ever Had in
House.

' WASHINGTON. Dec. 6. Launching
of tho new session of Congress was
completed today with delivery by Pres
ident Harding of his opening address
at a joint session of .the senate and
house, made notable by the presence
of delegates to the armament limitation
conference. . ,
Proposal's for a flexible tariff, adjust
able by the president or the tariff com
mission; for an industrial tribunal and
for a constitutional amendment to stop
the flood of tax free securities, were
the president's outstanding statement
on domestic affairs. Turning to the
international field, the president said of
the armament limitation conference
that "a most, gratifying world accom
plishment is not improbable." He also
urged enactment of the measure for
funding the allied debt, proposed food
relief for starving Russia, expressed
satisfaction over the nation's being at
peace, and held out promise of aid to j
the world In war restoration. j
A hearty reception was given the 1
president by what was said to be one
of the largest audiences ever jammed
into the house chamber. Demonstra
tions of a full minute each occurred
when he. entered at 12:30 o'clock and
again when he concluded at 1:20, the
entire audience standing and applaud- J
ng. Applause also broke Into his ad-;
iress frequently, especially from house
members when he discussed topics of
administration policy, and with es
pecial volume when he advanced his
plan for a tribunal to weigh disputes
between capital and labor, and de-(
dared that bhor organizations should;
not be rjermiUed to "txact unfair terms
of employment or subject the public to
actual distress.' "' - ;:
The audience, which included the
cabinet, diplomatic corps and many
high officials, besides the foreign dele-
gates, also responded warmly when,
with manifest feeling, the president
urged aid for starving peoples of Rus-
sja and pr0posed a gift of
bushels and corn and 1,000,0'

LOVING CUP OFFERED
BEST POULTRY JUDGE
At the poultry show held In con
nection with the fair of the Escam
bia County Fair Association in the
fall of 1910 there was a beautiful
copper loving cup offered by the
Southern States Lumber Company
to be awarded the person who could
best judge Barred Plymouth Rocks.
This cup was to be won three times
before it became the property of the
winner. It was won once by Mrs.
Oscar Williams, of Magnolia farm,
and once by Mrs. William F. Reed,
Jr., after which time tho fair was
abandoned and it has not since been
competed for, but now that there is
to be another poultry show this
week the Southern States Lumber
Company are very anxious that it
be competed for again, and have the
Dup on display in Klein's jewelry
store.
For one to try for this cup is
very simple. Any person desiring
to enter the contest should so ad
vise the superintendent of the show
who will .allow them permission to
Judge the Barred Plymouth Rocks
on exhibition. The contestant
should writs his awards on a elip
of paper showing name and address,
which should bo turned over to tho
show superintendent, then when
tho judge, Miss Florence Forces of
New Decatur, Ala., who has been
employed to do the Judging and
awarding o the premiums will look
over each contestant's list of
awards and decide to whom tho cup
offered shall be awarded.
