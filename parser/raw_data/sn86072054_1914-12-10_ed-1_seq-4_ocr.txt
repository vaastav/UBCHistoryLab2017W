GIVING BUSINESS A CHANCE.

?fjFefglves out the word that the pro

"Can now go along without further
molestation from Congress. This is
indeed a great relief, but we fear that
too much damage has already been
done to business for it to make an

peculiar uses,'due to'a keen nose "for

Ui&ma G. Bernard has few rivals. At
tho present time he chides England,
Germany and other Christian Powers,
Austrian and Russia to wit, for not
closing their churches while the inter
national orgy of murder is on. The
pagans of old Rome were moro con
sistent for when they drew the sword
they closed the Temple of Peace. Mod
ern powers are strictly pagan, not
Christian. Their people would be
Christian If they ruled, but they are
overruled by unmotal governments
concerned only with national rapacity
and greed. But while the Powers are
hopelessly pagan, they have not the
honesty of Paganism of the old school.
Thoy keep up the pitiable pretense
of being representative of their peo
plo and Christian. Tho proper penalty
to inflfct on these relics of savagery
Is take power away from thorn and
let the people rule."
THE PHONE MERGER
We do not know what prospect
there is for tho abolition of one of
tho telephone companies In Fairmont]
as our credentials do not carry us
through the portals of the domiciles
of "Big Business" nor into the sanc
tums of the Potentates of special
[irlvlege, and this is not saying that
either of the two local telephone com-,
panies are enjoying special privilege
to an obnoxious degree or that the
West Virginian has any grievance
with either company, but we do say
that such a plan would be a most econ
omical one for the telephone users.
Two local telephone lines have the ef
fect of doubling telephone rates by
lequlrlng everybody with any business
to transact to put In both phones
when under a consolidation ono phone
would answer tho purpose better
than the two. A monopoly of any
public service was formerly a danger
ous thing in tills state as tho ser
vice might be allowed to deteriorate
and the prices go up but with the
Fubllc Service Commission to protect
the people there is little danger, if
any danger of such things happen
ing. With one phone line the service
should be impro"ed at a .lower rate
owing to the reduction in the operat
ing expenses. '
The chamber of commerce will dis
cuss this question tonight and it is
to be hoped that some plan will be
evolved to bring about a consolidation
of tho two lines.
The man who really Is willing to be
gin at the bottom u&ually stays there.
It isn't the competition of woman
that threatens the average man. It

SENATOR WHITE, EDITOR.
Senator Geo. E. White, It is reported,
has become the now owner of tho Wen
ton Independent, the able weekly which
has been conducted by R. Ad. Hall for
the past twenty years. Mr. Hall has
made the Independent an effective
weapon for the people and tho paper
is among the strongest of the weekly
papers of the state, but under the man
agement of Senator White the paper
will lose none of Its virility and staunch
republicanism.
WHAT'S THE USE!
What's the use of the Preston News
and the Klngwoort Argus printing any
papers at all? Why not just have tho

A good suggestion. The way the
State Journal was quoted in the Pres
ton county papers last week is enough
to make all the other editors of the
state green-eyed with Jealousy.

THE CHILDREN'S ARMY.
' .No tune of tootling life',
No beat of the rolling drum.
And yet with the thrill of life
The hordes of children come.
Freckled and chubby and lean,
Indifferent, good and bad,
| Bedraggled and dirty and clean,
Richly ond poorly clod.
They come on toddling teet i
To the school house door ahead;
The neighboring alley and street
Resound to the infant tread.
Children .of those who came
To the land.of the promising West,
Foreign of (ace and name.
Are shoulder to shoulder pressed
With the youth of the native land
IZn the quest for truth and light,
As the valorous little band
Trudges to left and right.
Cred and color and race
Unite from the ends of the earth,
[ Blending each noble trace
| In the pride of a glorious birth.
Race and hate and tho past
Fuse In a melting heat
As the little hearts beat fast
To the stir of a common beat. ?

For the stock which the fates destroy
Belong to the cosmic strain
Of American girl snd boy.

Germany and Workers.
For over 20 years Germany has
been handling her laboring men and
women in an intelligent and humane
fashion. Each state in the empire has
50 or more labor exchanges. Each
capital city has an exchange which
acts as a clearing house for the pro
vincial exchanges. Between these la
bor clearing houses in the capital cit
ies there is a steady flow of communi
cation. If a man cannot be placed in j
his own citjr, ho may he in another;
It not in his state, then in another. I
Work is found for him. A million or!
more men and women are placed 9V
ery year by this organization. It Is
one. of the many admirable ways in
which Germany has been preserving'
and training mon that when tho time |
came she might have them.
