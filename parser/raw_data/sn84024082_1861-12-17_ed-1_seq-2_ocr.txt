Jailer from Captain T. Q. Uildcbranl.
Ciimn Lyon, Bird' Point, Mo., Dec. 4.
Fkiends ablet-:-
I have teen thinking about writing to
you some time in return n to matter bere
and particu'arly to inform the public that
there was such a raiment in existence as
the 20th Illinois Volunteers. If I have
been asked once, I have ' been asked
twenty times by visitors, "Why don't we
hear of the 20th in the newspapers, as well
as other regiments T" And I have wonder
ed myself that nfter as much bard work
marching, grubbing and clearing camp
grounds, making entrenchments, scouting
the country over after the enemy and fight
ing him at Fredericktown against fearful
odds, the only notice of tiny account we
Lave received, excepting in the "Sigxai.,"
was the official reports uf the officers of the
cxpeditii n.
It would be well to give a brief history
of what we have been doing: Whin we
arrived at Camp l'ope, we w ere set U work
clearing off our camp ground. The stumps
were thick as three in a bed and two in the
middle. You cuW have walked upon them
without wett'u g your feet. When we hud
the giound fairly grubbed, we were order
ed Couth. e came to oipe Girardeau
and loi.nd it nn exposed point, very im
portant in a stratagic point f view. Fur
x weeks our regiment held the p'nce
itlo i't nrfrlery or entrenchmenis, while
(icn. Wntkin was in ramp within thirty
five nnles of us, ard the country overrun
with the enemy. The village itself was
Strongly Secesh, and our camp was full of
pies daily. Scouting parties scouicl the
eouDtry in almost every direction from our
camp, and we were thus ennhled to afford
succor to a hirg extent of country.
In these excursions into the enemy's
CMtn'ry, in ninny of hich your correspon
dent participated, deeds of daring and
VMwess were performed, which (hough not
finding their way to the public, are Mill
characteristic ol our bravo leys, and wi'l
Jong beremmberd by those who witness
ed and were bent fitted by them. On one
rceanion, sevei.teen (Tour men were sent to
capture an inhuman animal in the shape of
a man who had turned his mother and sis
ter out of doors, for entertaining Union
sentiment. We went the w hole disinncn,
thirty miles, into a strong Secesh neighbor
hood, captured the ijent and Ma-ted to re
turn arrived at Jackson ten miles from
camp, finnd the place full of men w ho had
met to drill, as n Secesh company lent bet n
formed there. Although four or five to one
they "tkfdaddled," ns the boys suv, when
our boys approached, and left the boys to
fursue their way They were pur-iied by
thirty of Jeff. Thompson's cavalry who
were not mire than thirty minutes I ubinj
thrni, but were u t evrri;;k n.
The long roll .sounded one right after
ire were all in bed. and we were sileml v
drawn up in bne Our officer led us to the
summit of the h '11, and ordered us to stack
arms. The shovels and picks were then
put into ourhands. In the morning. In! an
embankment iereril feet high encircled
the brow of (he hill, commanding the ton n.
We fortified that place, rendering it almost
impregnable. We have fince ussi.-ted in
fortifying this point, and how constructing
winter fiiarters. It would be our good
luck to be ordered away about the time
they wsre constructed. Ifthoy will send
as Smith, we will be content
At the bnttlo of Fredrick! own our men
were in the thickest of the fight. Oil nil

OFFICIAL PA PER OF THE CIT1 .
7'BCMlay, December 17, I SCI. i
"
The Report of flic Secretary of I
the Treasury.
Jt must be admitted that this document j
contains matters and suggestions of vast i
importance to the people of the loyal
States. It is ably written and however
much we may differ with-its recommcnda
ticni tnl policy, we cannot but commend
the clearness, perspicuity and good order
with which the Secretory discusses, pre
(tents arid arranges the subjects embraced in
his report.
The Secretary, after referring to the rec
ommer.d.-.ti'r.B contained in liis July re
port, gives the manner in which he obtain
ed loans for the various purposes of the
Government. He rehearses the agreement
f ntcred into between Ibe bunk and hiras If,
by which the former agreed to take loans
sufficient fir the emergency. The amount
realized ly 1 .ans up to tlio 9th of Decem
ber was $197.7-12 588, w hich has not been
sufficiuit to meet the accruiug expendi
tures. Mr. Chase admits that the revenue re
ceipts have not met his expectations. He
says the act modifying the rates of duties',
differed materially from the measure be rec
ommended to Congress, especinl'y in dimin
isbing duties on tea, coffee and sugar, an 1
exempting goods in warehouses and on
shipboard. The difference is presented as
disadvantageous to the revenue.
The receipts of revenue from du'.ies fir
1SC2 is estimated at $32,198,002, and from
lands nnd miscellaneous sources $2,301,
002. The reprrt favor9 the confiscation of
prejerty in the rebel States, and recom
mrn Is that the proceeds bo applied to the
satisfaction of claims arising from the war.
The Secretary, however, thinks that the
slaves should form an exception to any rule
ci c. nS -cation. In his eyes they are not
property ; nnd hence he is in favor of a
general system ot e.naneipa'ioii. II
wains i:ie negroes iiiierare.l ana place,! Mi
an cipialily with white men as far as labor
and social privileges are concerned. This,
of course, will meet the approbation of the
Abolitionists.
An increase of duties on tea, coffee and
sugar is strongly urged upon Congress
The Secretary is also in favor of increas
ing tho direct tax levied by digress at
the special session, so as to produce from
loyal States a revenue of twenty mi lions
of dollars the duties on stills, li.jnors.

fifths of a cent on the real and personal
property of loyal citizens will rroduce S41,
000,000, the pronoscd income tax adding
$10,000,000.
In reference to the probable duration of
the war, Mr. Chase earnestly hopes that it
will be brought to an auspicious termina
tion before the first of next July; and in
that event he says the provisions of revenue
already recommended, will amply suffice
for a financial basis without additional loan.
and enal la the Government at onco to be- j
gin a redueti' n of the existing debt.
If the wir continues to July 1st, 18G2,
the national debt w ill be S-3 17,3,12.802 ; if
till tho 1st of July, InII, it wiil be in
round numbers ?1, 000. 000, 000 certainly
no inconsiderable sum upon which to pav
interest, saying nothing about the reduc
tion. The mst important portion of the ro
?ort, in our estimation, is the recommenda
tion of the Secretary relative to the issuing
of treasury notes. Hi. views on this sub
ject are startling. If his plan for furnishs
ing a national currency and carrying on
the war be adorted by Congress, and it
doubtless wili be, a fin-ncial revolution will
inevitably ensue. Let the Government is
sue three or four hundred millions of dol
lars in treasury note?, mnka them a legal
tender, and put them in circulation as
money, every bunk in the Union will have
t i call in its circulation and suspenJ. Thus
we may look for a financ:al change in thin !
country (hat will eflect every department'.. f I
business and trade in a degree that cannot
bo estimated now.
Tin ugh the exigencies of the case are of
a r're?!" " nB!ur(. "o believe the Govern-
moot pshou'd never engage in this treasury
note system. We fear that ultimately it
will bo attended with uncertain consequer- !
ipiences. The immediate fff-ct ni doubt
w.li ''-j f ivorabiy bit to sine extent, but
the remote are portentuous if bankruptcy
and ruin. Wo do not btbeve in the ( jv
ernmoi t turning I aoker, nevertheless t':s
is the scbemo of Mr. Chase. He sees no
other way of carrying on the war, but we
apprehend that the present relief will be
swallowed up by future disasters grow in"
out of the system.
We agree that if we had no "Ab dition-i-ts."
n i party to opp. sL. tho aggressions
of rl.ivery we would now have no war.
True Democrat.
An honest
admission and a truthful
one too.
This is what we have maintained all
along. We have always held that Grei W,
a 'd Hale, nr.d Suainer. and bidding, a; d
Livrj y, mil tl.uir followers, were tho
prime moveis iu bringing the appalling
troubles unon us. And it
sure ti rec-.ru our neighbor's ieco-r,itiou of j
the fact. j
Ttierefore, be it proihimed, tiiat were it
not for the Abolitionist., we i;md now
be living iu peaoe and our unfortunate
oioo'iy ann uesoiating Iratracidal war.
But while we hold that the primary
cause of the r was the revolutionary
propajindism promulgated by the Aboli
tiutiietfl, and the wholesale denunciation of
nesro slavery as a fcreat national sin by the
clergy and fanaticel politicirnsofthe North,
at the same time, be it understood, wo do
not justify the rebellion, or exculpate the
Southern leaders who, we Lelieve, were ic
strutnenta!. alike with the Abolitionists, in
producing a disiaernLerunat uf the Vnhm.
The Emancipation of the
Slaves,
The Republicans, it seems, bavo agreed
on this proposition as a parly measure. . At
the caucus of their members of Coneress in
, ashington last week, a resolution iu favor
of the confiscation and etnai cii ation of tht
slaves of tha rebels was adopted, almost
unanimously. Tlierefure. it is eettled as n
party measure that the licpuhlicans are in
USTnr of "berating 'he slaves ly a liw of
tonjjrc, and of turning them hope
amongst us to comp?to with our white la
bore;s and to fill rur poor bouses and pris
ons with a cl iss of people not possessing
the capacity to proyido for themstlves.
We enter our protest against this entire
emancipation policy. While it threatens
ruin to the Union and prolonged civil war,
at the same time it is in direct violation to
the cnostituticn of the United States. Tho
constitution expressly declares that the
States have tfi3 power, if they choose to d i
so, to abolish shivery, but that C..ngres.s
p.'SJfsses no s-jch power.
The question of emancipating the tlivos,
is one which belongs to the States, exclus
ively. Congress, nor any other power, has
any right whatever to interfere with the
domestic institutii in of the States. The
States themselves are sovereign in this re
spect. If the loyal people ol Kentucky, or
Maryland, or Missouri, or any other South
em Stiite, should jasa a law 1. berating the ll,',t Ael nmsut canoot rxi-t ' haif

House. Mr. Lovejoy offered a resolu
tion instructing the Committee on Foreign
Aflai-s to report a bill establishing diplo
matic relations between the United Stutes
and Hayti atol Liberia. The resolution
lies over.
Mr Lansing's preamble and resolution,
offered on Monday, came up.
Mr. Steven-, of Pennsylvania, said : "'If
the passage of the resolu ion is to have a
good effect, espceially in the West, the
sooner it is passed the better. The alle
gation of General Halleck, as an excuse
for his order, that luuitive slaves, whom
he promises to exclude from bis lines, give
information to the enemy, is too bald a
pretext to justify him. The return of fu
gitive slnves was introduced by General
McClellan, and has been followed by Gens.
Dix, Kelley, and others. All these cases
nre a disgrace to the profession of arms.
if such returns of fugitives have I eon
made by the commanding Ganerals, they
deserve to have their epaulets stripped
from their shoulders, nnd, if it has been
done by higher authority, then God for
give tin m, for they know not what they do.
Mr. Lovejoy expressed his honest con
viction that such orders were issued by the
commanding Generals of the army, with
out orders from the President. He was
satisfied of the fact. While the President
doe not remove nod cashier them ns he
(Lovejoy) woii'ie", bo did not believo the
commanding Genorals had power for etch
inhuman and shameful muasuies.
Mr. Blair, of M i., s.ii.l Mr S..n. ,
identiy misunderstood Gen. HaPeck's or
der. The General informed him that he
had no idea of doing any thing contrary to
tbe'aw of he last Congress and the policy
of the Government. -
A debate ensued between Messrs. Blair
and Lov.-j.iy, on the subject of Gen. Hal
leek's recent order about slaves.
Mr. Julim referred to th case of Col.
Brown, of nn Indirna regiment, who re
fused to deliver up fugitives until so or
dered by Secretary Cameron. He (.resumed
the a Imicistration sanctioned such pro
ceedings Mr. Kellogg assumed to say tin4, the
administration had nothing to do wilh thut
orde-, ni,d would uot indicate such a policy
to the army. .
The resolution which caused this debate
was tabled 78 ages to 04 nay.
