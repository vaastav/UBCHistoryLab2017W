Wasiiimitos', Deo., P. The annual
portof. tlio secretary of tlio treasury,
submitted to Congress to-day, dis
cusses tin) problem of currency reform
an follows:
"In tholr respcetlvn onutial reports
to Congress, ray predecessors since tlio
close of tlio civil wnr Imva callcil nt
tcntlon with unfrtlliitfc regularity to
tlio menace to tho public credit oc
casioned by the continued uso of tlio
largo voluino of Ictiiitud Hubilltfc-,
represented by legal tender notes,
nnd have ennstantly appealed
for micIi legislative notion us would
remove tlio dangers pointed out.
Although these warnings nml nppculs
have not as yet met with tlio rcspon
idvo notion thnt their serious nnturo
justifies, It Is not now the pnrt of wis
dom to ignore them. In fuel, as time
has gone on, nil the reasons upon
which theso warnings unil uppoiils
wcro baed have received additional
force. Tlio enormous depreciation In
the eommoreial vnluo or silver, ns com
pared with gold, has greatly Increased
the financial responsibilities of the
government In Its demand liabilities,
and nil the logical consequences of the
fact should be boldly fnecd.
"Tho advantages of a strong post
tlon In tho nutional treasury, with its
accompanying benefits' to all commer
cial Interests nnd great reinforcement
of the public credit, can, 1 believe, be
secured without any uusoUlIng legis
lation, lu u manner easy to be compre
hended by all, and with small cost to
tho people.
"Tho recommendations I matco
intiBt bo construed us totitatlvo stops
In a direction which, if consistently
pursued, will ultimately lead to con
ditions theoretically desirable rather
than bn bolug In themselves final
measures to that end. The condition
of tho treasury lu its relation to de
mand obligations requires that one of
two stops.bo taken. Tho one may bo
a large reinforcement of tho perma
nent gold reserve; tho other may be
by an important reduction in tho ob
jectionable form of liabilities. Tho
Uttor In, in my opinion, the more Ml
titrable. NOTK ISSUING DKPAI'TMI'XT.
"First I recommend that proper
legislation bo enacted which will es
tablish, separate nnd apart, from the
ordinary operations of tho treasury ns
they relate to revenue and expendi
tures, a department to bo designated
and known us tho Issuo nnd redemp
tion division. To this division the
sum of 318..,000,000 in gold should be
not ovor from the general fund in the
(treasury, to bo used only for redemption
purposes, nnd nil the silver dollars now
held for redemption of silver certifi
cates, and ull tho silver bullion and
dollars coined therefrom, bought un
der tho uct of 1810, should bo passed
ito tho same account. Further, that
tho sum of $200,OUO,UUO in tho legal
tender notes of tho United Stutcs
known us greenbacks bo collected as
liorolnufter described, and deposited
In tho said issuu and redemption di
vision, to bo disbursed therefrom only
upon tho receipt lu exchange therefor
or nn equivalent, amount or jold coin
Such gold, when so secured, to bo held
in said division as part of tlio general
redemption lumi.
".Secoud, I recommend that pro
vision bo imido for tlio issuo of re
funding loan bond, payable after ten
years at tno pleasure or tuo govern
ment, such bonds to bear Interest nt
the ratu of 8J; per cent ner annum,
payable, principal and interest, in gold
coin; and that tho sccrotary of the
treasury bo authorized to Issuo such
bonds and recclva In payment therefor.
with an equitable allowance for tho
difference In interest, any part or ull
of tho outstanding loans of tho United
States which mature by their terms of
payment In tho years 1901, 1007 and
1085.

IIONDS PAYAHL1 IN COLD.
"Tlio advantage Involved In tho
proposed action lies In tills: It re
moves an ambiguity from our contract
obligations an nniblgulty which af
fects unfavorably tho government
credit. Tho word 'coin' now used to
express the obligation In tho public
debt, Is an ambiguous word. It is no
doubt understood by tho morn dis
criminating public creditor to mean
gold coin, and the solemn act of
Congress pledging the maintenance
of silver coin upon a parity with
Itold coin mnkos it Impossible to con -
struo tho word 'coin, as therein used,
to menu anything other than gold or
its full equivalent. Vet as this I s a
ronoluslon of logic rather than a clear
statement of fact, tho simpler and
more humble Investors or would-be in
vestors in tho public debt are con
fused nnd doubtful, and tho public
credit Is tho weaker therefore
"To refund our outstanding honih
now payable in coin Into .bonds pay-
ublo in gold would strengthen und
confirm tho publlo credit and put us
In n position to command tho markots
of the world for our securities on tlio
most advantageous terms.
"The requirements of tlio national
banking law now makes It Impossible
to organlr.o n bank with a capital of
less than $.10,000, no matter how
small tho place in which it is to ho
located, or how restricted tho volume
of business thcrn to bo transacted
liecuuso of that, with tho added ox
Icnso of taxation, both national and
local, many communities am deprived
of tlio aid of banks of issuo nnd
burdened with enormous rates of ex
change nnd interest charges.
"In order to obviate to us great nn
-extent us uossible th.o.-e objections
and make tho net more harmonious
with proper business conditons, 1 rec
ommend thnt it bo ammended in the
following particulars:
AS TO Tin: HANKS.
"first, I'crmlt national bunks to bo
organized with a minimum capital of
S'i',000 lu any plneo having u popula
tion of '.',000 Inhabitants or less.
"Second. Itcdttco tho rate of taxa
tion on circulating notes secured by
deposit of bonds to one-half of 1 per
cent per annum.
"Third. I'crmlt banks now organ
ised or hereafter organized to issue
circulating notes to the pir valuo of
tho refunding bonds hereinbefore
si.ggcsted, when deposited by them
with tho treasurer of tho United
States; and, further, nlloiv such banks
us shall avail themselves of tho oppor
tunity to deposit us cecurlty with tho
treasury of the United State-, green
backs, treasury notes, or bllver certifi
cates to tho total amount of 8200,000,
00f, against which thero shall at
once bo issued to them by tho comp
troller of the currency national haul:
notes to nn equal amount, it being
further provided that from time to
time, nt his convenience, tho secretary
of the- treasury si. all aubslltuto for
tlio grcenbacKs, treasury notes, and
silvor certificates so deposited to se
cure circulation, bonds of tho same
class and diameter as tho refunding
bonds first named to tho amount of
8200,000,000, such bonds to bo charge
nblo to said banks and iy them ac
counted for at such price (not less than
par) as the market quotations may in
dicate to bo tholr fair market value.
During the period of time Intervening
between the, deposit of greenbacks,
treasury notes, und sliver certificates
and the substitution of the bonds by
tho secretary of tho treasury tho cir
culating notes specifically Issued
therefor shnll be exempt from taxa
tion. Upon such substitution of
bonds tho funds released therobyshall
at onco Iw transferred by tho secre
tary of tlio trensury to the issuo and
redemption division.
NOTLS WITHOUT SF.CUUlTY.
"Fourth. After said banks have de
posited such bonds, greenbacks, treas
ury notes, or silver certificates to tlio
amount of 30 per cent of their capital
they shall bo permitted to issuo bank
notes In addition to tho SO per cent
thus provided, to tho extent of 85 per
cent of such deposit, which sold 85 per
cent may be unsecured by any direct
pledge of security but Issued against
the assets of the bank.
"Fifth. Intend tlio guaranty of
payment by tho government to all
circulating notes of tlio bank whether
issued against deposited security or
ngainst assets.
"Sixth. To secure the government
ngaius't loss, if, any, attaching to its
guaranty a tux of 8 per cent per an
num on unsecured eit-eulutlon shall be
levied to create a safety fund, which
shall be invested by tho '.Secretary ol
the Treasury and thu comptroller of
tho currency In government bonds,
lu addition to such funds tho govern
ment shall be fnrther protected by
having n first lien upon nil asficts in
use of failure of tho issuing bank.
"Seventh All nolo shall be re
deemed in the city of Nou; York at the
snbtreasury, and at such other sub.
treasuries as may be designated by the
comptroller of tho currency, with tho
approval of tho secretary of the treas
ury. Tho control of such redemption
shall bo under the direction of the
comptroller of the currency and made
from a redemption fund of 10 percent,
to bo provided and maintained by tho
banks.
"I'lghth itestrict the Issue of na
tional bank notes to the denomination
of SI0 nnd upward.

TARIFF LAW'S OPERATION.
Respecting tho operation of tho new
tariff law tho report says:
"The tariff net of July 24, 1807, en
titled 'An net to provide rcvonno for
tho government and to encourage tho
Industries of tho United States,' has
not been In force long enough to de
termine fully Its merits, but it is con
fidently believed that when in full
operation it will afford ample revenue
for the ordlunry needs of the govern
ment, while adequately protecting
our manufacturing nnd agricultural
interests.
"Owing to tho heavy importations
which wero made in anticipation of
tho passage of tho measure tho cus
toms revenues received during tho
first three mouths of the operation of
tiie net havo boon diminished, and are
not an indication of therovenuo which
the law will produce when importa
tions are normal.
"Our homo Industries havo already
felt the stimulating effect of the law.
"Steps havo been taken to fully ad
vise other governments of tho provis
ions relating to reciprocal trade, and
a commissioner bus been appointed to
assist in tlio negotiations of troatlcs
under sections :i and I of the net.

dying mother this morning, nccoiii
pauicd by his wife nnd his niece, Miss
MabcL As Mr. McKinley entered tho
sick room, nccompunlcd by his wife
and Miss Mabel McKinley, Miss Helen,
sister of tho president, said: "Mother,
hero Is William and Ida."
Tlio president knelt and kissed his
mother tenderly and reverently. As ho
did so she put her right arm about his
neck and signified that she know him.
She also rccogni.ed tho president's
wife nnd reached her hand toward her.
Dr. Phillips, tho faintly physician,
who was present at tho time, said
that ho hud never known such n
recognition to occur In a uaso where
tho patient was so advanced in years.
It was plain to tho President, how
ever, that dcsplto the rallies sho had
had, his mother had been falling slnco
he had left Saturday afternoon.
Soon afterward, Mother McKinley
lapsed ir)to uuconscloubness and the
strength that had apparently been

mother and son seemed to leave her.
For an hour after his arrival tho
President snt by tho bedside holding
the hand of his mother.
"Mrs. McKinley Is resting qulotly,"

BANKRUPTCY LAWS.

Mr. Ilpmli-mnti nil the StliMttlnn Mr.
(,'uunon on Currency.
WAfuiiNflTOV, Dec. r, To tho ques
tion, "What In your opinion Is the
prospect of bankruptcy legislation ut
tlio coming scslon of Congress?"
(cucrul Henderson of Iowa, chairman
of tho House committee on judiciary,
answered: Well, as to that, It Is
rather early for me to express nn
opinion. On Monday I propose to In
troduce 11 bankruptcy bill which will
bu substantially identical with the
otto passed by the House of llcprc
sonlallvcs In the last Congress. There
has also been referred to this commit
tee tho bill passed by the Senate at
tlio special session. There will bo n
meeting of tlio committee early in tho
week and we wilt exchange vlows on
tlio subject and see what prospect
thero is of a favorublo committee
nctlon. Then n Mtb-comnilttco will
tako tho matter up and frame n,
measure, either a substitute for the
Senate bill, or taking that as a basis,
proposo amendments to It,"
"Do yon think there is a stron? pub
lic demand for such legislation'.''' was
asked.
"Yes, I do, and believe thero will
bo n strong pressure brought to bear
In favor of it. btich legislation prop
erly framed and gin riled Is required
in tlio opinion of a great many people
besides myself, anil all for thu same
reason. During tho hard times of the
last administration thousands ot men
went to tho wall and their energies
wcro bottled up, who If they
could find legal release from
Hie chains which now bind them
would again and immediately rcsttmo
tho activities of a business life und add
immensely to tho levcrago in favor of
general business prosperity. They
would be able to shara In the benefits
nt the tariff legislation of last summer,
and tho country would be all tho bet
ter for it. And yet, strong resistaneo
will undoubtedly bo offered lo the en
actment of such legislation and no
man ought now to attempt to predict
what the outcoiuo may be, so far as
the coming session is concerned. The
most I daro say is that my hops is
trong."
Itcprcscntatlvc Mercer of Nebraska,
who Is chairman of the House commit
tee on public buildings and grounds,
agrees with Cieucrnl Henderson us to
the desirability of bankruptcy legisla
tion. Ho said: "Wo hove thousands
of men in Nebraska who wcro laid fiat
by tho hard times "of tit last three
or four years who will never be ablo
to regain their feet, financially speak
ing, until such a law Is passed."
Chairman Cannon of tho House ap
propriation committee, in reply to u
question ns to whether the people in
his part of tlio country were In favor
of bankruptcy legislation at the com
ing session said: "No, not in tho coun
try districts. Thero Is considerable!
feeling in favor of it in Chicago und
also considerable opposition to It I
understand. It might perhaps bo a
good thing to havo a voluntary bank
ruptcy law, to expire by limitation
nix months after its enactment"
"What do you think ot tho prospect
of currency legislation'.'"
"Oh, what's tho use of talking about
that In tho face of the condition of
affairs in tho Senate? Why, If tho
House should pass a currency bill tho
Senate would probably strike out
everything after tho enacting clnuso
nnd send us a free coinage bill.
What's tho matter with tho currency,
anyhow, If we cnti collect revenuo
enough to pay tho current expenses of
the government und havo a littlo left?
So far as the retirement of tho green
backs Is concerned, I do not believe
that a bill containing that provision
could pass tho House of llepresontn-
tlvcs. Then, why not lot well enough
alone? We've got to fight tho free sil
ver battlo over again Ju 1000, and wo
would better prepare for It"
