RIDS THE SYSTEM
> OF CATARRH 4
Oatarrh comes as a result of Impurities and morbid matter in the
circulation and Is a disease that only attacks mucous membrane The
entire inner portion of the body is lined with a delicate skin or covering
of soft sensitive flesh Thousands of tiny blood vessels are interlaced
throughout this mucous surface and it is through these that the inner
membrane receives Its nourishment and is kept in healthful condition
thet
t tissues become diseased and Oatarrh gets a foothold in the system The
early stages of Oatarrh are characterized by such symptoms as a tight
stuffy feeling In the head watery eyes buzzing noises in the ears with par
partial
are merely symptoms and while sprays inhalations and other local treat
ment may temporarily relieve them Catarrh cannot be cured until the
cleansingthe
the blood of all impure catarrhal matter It goes down into the circula
tlon and attacks the disease at its head and removes every particle of the
t catarrhal impurity Then the mucous linings are all supplied with fresh
J pure blood and allowed to heal instead of being kept in a constant state
of irritation by the catarrhal matter Special book on Oatnrrh and any

New York Dec 9Tho prosecu

the minor cmplpyes of the sugar trust
charged with conspiracy to defraud
the govovniilent The defense wlji
then enter a pica of lack of Jurisdic
tion and all the lawyers on that lido
expressed the utmost confidence In
tho success of that movement to tree
their clients Preceding this a for
mal motion io f dlsmlSlt the Indictments
against un six defendants will bo
made on the ground that thQ govern
ment has failed to prove its case
Anticipating that Special Judge
Martin will overrulo time latter mo
tion tho lawyers for the defense are
prepared to present strong arguments
on the plea of lack of jurisdiction
Every one of the defendants Is a resi
dent of she Eastern judicial district
which comprises all of Long Island
A year ago most of them were tried
on substantially the Indictments on
which they are now being tried In the
Southern district of New York wh4ch
comprises Manhattan Their lawyers
will contend that tho constitution of
the United States was violated when
their clients were brought from tho
judicial district of their residence for
trial
Defendant Confident
Messrs C6chraneIexow and Deal
tie attorneys for the sugar company
employee believe their appeal will
avail with Judge Martin and thut tho
indictments against their clients will
be dismissed or that they will be re
manded for trial to the federal court
In Brooklyn after they shall have
j been relndlcted by a grand jury
thereIn connection with tne trial United
States District Attorney Wise and his
assistants expressed much gratifica
tion that In his annual message to
congress President Taft had specific
ally urged that no Investigation of
the tmgar trust by congress shall bo
authorized at this time Mr Wise
Intimated broadly that If congress
t
> should remain inactive In the matter
> for several months results of much I
more far reaching importance than
are hoped for from the trials now in
progress will be achieved
Evidence Important
I Evidence regarded as Important by
Henry L Stlmson and his assistants
In tho prosecution of the men on

discovery of the secret spring byi
which the scales were made to under
weigh that the weights ran between
98C and 90S pounds before the dip
clvery while after that they ran
from 1004 to 1020 pounds
Harry Waters a liquidator In the
customs fiqrvjce produced tabulations
mndq up from books put In evidence
Rowing the difference In weights be
tween those returned rand those re
ported by the government A copy
of the tabulation was handed to each
