Declares That the Five Physicians

(By Associated PresB.)
HBRKudBR, N. Y.. Doc. 3.?Ncvor
perhaps in the history of Horkhnor
County Court hns the scene of a mur?
der trial noon characterized by such
bitter attacks of counsel as was dis?
played In the summing up of the (ill
lotto case today.
Judge Devendorf said he expected
the case to go to t.he Jury today but
after District Attorney Ward hod
spoken for fifteen minutes court? ad?
journed until morning.
Former Senator A. M. Mills, a close
personal friend of the prosector, in
bis hiBt appeal to the jury to acquit
Chester EX Gillette of murdering brace
Brown at Pig Moose Lake on July 11.
dramatically declared that tho five
physicians who had sworn that there
was a blood clot on draco Brown's
brain had sworn to a falsehood; that
they had Rotten together and agreed
>ipon a common story for the witness
stand and deliberately withhold tes?
timony favorable to his client, Inti?
mating that physicians were Improp?
erly Influenced. He ndded: "If there
is any evidence of graft some of these
doctors may figure In It. They were
paid largo fecB to Rive evidence which
was so prepared that It would convict
this boy. I charge .here and tfajv?
nnd I know personally each' of bheph'y
slcians?Hint they did not bring In
all the facts, that, thev did not re?
port something favorable to the bay.
Each of t\e doctors knew that a fraud
was being perpetrated.
Ward's Hot Reply.
District Attorney Ward .lumped to
bis feet and launched into n scathing
denunciation of Senator Mills nnd the
methods ho bad taken to sway tho
jury over to the defense.
"When Mi. Mills stands here and
tells yon as he just has," he said;
"that these five doctors, reputable
men of Herklmev enmity and your
friends wbo enter your homes, per?
haps, every day nre liars nnd burglars,
he says that which Is not true.
"Now what Insidious thing did he
mean when he told von about Kraft?
Was there nnv graft, when the poor
girl was brought Into the woods In be
murdered? Did graft cause thnt? What
did he moan?
"I charge here nnd now thai falre
hood was put Into the rase for the
prejudicing of some poor foolish juror
and to keep him from eiving nroher
consideration to the evidence In tho
case."
In this train, so excited at time*,
that, the big audience fairly gasnod,
the district attorney brought to n
spectacular close ,1 day of steadv
sneechmaklng full of dramatic pe?
riods.
