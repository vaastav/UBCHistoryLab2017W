FROM THE NATION'S CAPITAL.
From Our Own Correspondent.
WASHINGTON, D. C., Dec. 0,1899.
The important events of tho week in
Congress have been the reading of the
annual message of the President, and
the action of the House upon the cre
dentials of Roberts, the polygamist
from Utah.
The general comments heard upon
the executive communication are any
thing but nattering to its author. It
is enormously long, containing more
.words than any previous annual mes
sage to Congress. But its language is
dubious, lacking in force; and upon
the important issues of the day, it tails
far short of expectations, lt leaves
the Philippine question in the air; and
it is apparent now that the President
will not venture to put himself square
ly on record, officially, \ in regard to
this matter, prior to the national elec
tions. His utterances to Congress are
remarkably short of his speeches in the
west, on his famous around-the-circle
trip before the Ohio election. He now
ventures nothingupon the imperialistic
issue, beyond a statement, which no
one disputes or has denied, that the
insurrection must be ended, and that
obligations incurred in the war with
Spain for establishing order in terri
tory acquired by this country, must be
fulfilled. But upon the important
question as to how this government
snail govern the Asiatic possessions,
what measure of liberty shall be given
the Filipinos, the President is silent.
His evasion of the issue is taken gen
erally to mean that he is doubtful now
himself about the American people's
endorsement of the policy to hold per-,
manently all the Philippines and to*
govern them by a colonial system simi
lar to that of Great Britain.
The financial suggestions of Mr. Mc
Kinley have chilled the western Re
Eublioans, who cherished the hope that
e would, nominally at least, adhere to
the Republican platform of 1896 upon
which ne was elected, favoring larger
use of silver, to be brought about by
international agreement. Intelligent
men have understood fully that this
declaration was put in merely to pro
pitiate certain sections like Indiana
and Illinois where silver coinage is
strong, even with Republicans. Now,
however, the President comes out
squarely for the establishing more
firmly of the single gold standard, the
increase of national nankersprivileges,
and authority for the Secretary of the
Treasury to sell ?nited States bonds
on long or short time. As the present
Secretary exercises his discretion to
buy bonds and tnrn cash into Wall
street whenever the speculators are
short of money, this new proposition
implies a more flexible arrangement
by which the Treasury will lend itself
to the adjustment of rates to stock
speculators at their behest, or as the
whim may strike him, and both sell
and buy bonds for the purpose.
The trust question is treated with
little short ot misstatement of law and
facts. The day prior to the reading of
this message the United States Supreme
Court, in the important case of the
Addyston Pipe Co., decided that this
trust was in violation of Federal sta
tutes. There is no longer doubt that
existing law is sufficient to reach the
trusts, lt is for the Attorney-General
of the United States, an official of
McKinley's administration,to prosecute
the offenders. But Attorney-General
Griggs comes from New Jersey, the
great incorporating State of all the
trusts operating in the country, and
his thoughts and convictions are im
bued naturally with prejudices in favor
of the great capitalistic concerns.
Griggs can not see means for prosecu
ting these combinations under the so
called Sherman act, although the Su
preme Court can convict when cases
are brought before it. The easiest es
cape from such a situation is to ask for
more legislation, and this is the course
of the President. With laws enough
to cover the principal offenders, the
trust-fed administration asks Congress
to furnish more; and then it implies
these matters will receive considera
tion. When the next Kepublican con
vention meets, it will no doubt de
nounce vigorously, in general terms,
trusts and combinations for the purpose
of stifling competition. The Kepubli
cans have lost none of their character
istic effrontery, as is shown very well
in the latest message of their chief re
presentative.
No suggestion is made for lessening
the burdens of the standing army, but,
on the contrary, between the lines can
be read the purpose to establish it
permanently. If the President actual
ly believes the insurrection in the
Philippines is practically ended, why is
no hope extended that soon the army
can be reduced, and a portion at leas!
of the present burden of 8120,000,000
for this army can be taken off the
shoulders of the tax-payers if
In the House the message was listen
ed to impatiently. The thousands
who lilied tho galleries were thereto
witness the proceedings in the Roberts
case. They were bored by the long,
tedious message.
Without party division, the House
voted not to admit Roberts on his un
questionably perfect certificate of elec
tion as a Representative. The com
ments heard from the leaders on both
sides indicate very clearly that they
were not at all satisfied with their
votes upon the question. They re
cognize, unanimously, that a most dan
gerous precedent has been established
in refusing to admit any man present
ing regular credentials, a precedent
that may be invoked hereafter to great
injury of a State, by unscrupulous ma
jorities in the House. It can be stated,
moreover, that there were not six men
of the nearly 400 in the House who did
not recognize the fact that thc proper
procedure in the case would have been
to adopt the resolution offered by the
Democratic leader, Mr. Richardson,
proposing to admit Roberts temporari
ly upon his credeutials, and then refer
to the committee on tho judiciary for
immediate report thc charges of per
sonal disqualification. Roberts would
have been expelled under that method,
beyond the shadow of a doubt. S.
