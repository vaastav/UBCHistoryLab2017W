Washington*, D. C.f Dec. 9.?Men of
a I lairs and thoso in private life-.who
keep tho closest run of current events
tirst turned to President Harrison's
treatment of tho Chilean incident when
the message was laid before Congress
this nftemuon and copies of it weru dis
tributed at tho capitol. Tho greatest
interest was shown in this, the first oili
t ial statement of the status of the case.
The lirm manner in which the case
throughout was stated in tho messago
was very gratifying to every one who
lias the welfare of American citizens up
permost in their hearts, and in the esti
mation of almost all men in Congress
the President has uddod another wreath
to his crown in the effort to elevate tho
rights of our citizens abroad and de
mand respcct everywhere for the stars
and stripes.
NO.SKCRECV.
It was gratifying to Congress to learn
that the President intends to depart
from tho old customs of secrecy and
.-end to Congress and thereby give to
the entire country all of the facts relat
ing to the killing'ot American sailors in
the streets of Valparaiso because they
wore tho uniform of tho United .States;
also that he believes the present status
of tho case warrants somo sort of action
on the part of Congress. In the entire
treatment of tho Chilean affair the,
President gave the evidence of his old-1
time determination to maintain the:
rights of our citizens in foreign lands, j
War, or any hostile step, can only be !
taken by direction oi Congress, and the |
reference to Chile's attitude is regarded j
as significant.
DISASTERS OF l'REE COINAGE.
Next in importance in the iniml of
the public here, and that which was
quickly turned to, was the President's
reference to the financial condition of
the country and tho operation of the
MelCinloy "tariff law. Many supposed
the question so energetically evaded by
tlie Democratic leaders at present, that
of free eoinago, would bo "straddled,"
or ignored. Not so in this instance.
President Harrison, whilo not evincing
a dogmatic disposition, earnestly points
out the disastrous etfects absolute
t ree eoinago would have upon this coun
try if undertaken beforo an interna
tional standard and action is effected.
tin: courage of his convictions.
Then there were thoso who expected
to ;eo the President "fight shy" of a fair
and square endorsemontof tho tariff law
as it stands, and hoped to see him point
out objections and make suggestions of
amendment. On tho contrary, the en
dorsement of the law is full and direct,
and tho President expresses the belief
that it is the best that could have been
invented, taken in connection with the
reciprocity provisions.
Presidential messages have heretofore
been largely reviews of executive de
partment worl:, dealing in figures and
stereotyped facts. This evening's Star
voices the comments of hundreds of
ftatesmeii's at tho capitol to-day
when it says that whilo it is long, "it is
packed hi> full of meaty, interesting
matter, arid edited wjtli such riico dis
crimination, that it is hard to suggest
where the cut would bo properly made,"
that "it is not n formal rehash of tho
department reports," and that "tho
President has impressed his individu
ality upon every sentonce of it. Tho
art of putting things effectively, of
which ho has shown his mastery in tho
admirable condensed speeches which
ho has made from tune to time during
his administration, has evidently not
deserted him."
AN' IMPORTANT FEATURE.
Not the least important feature of tho
President's message, and one which will
attract the attention oi tho entire na
tion, is iiis discussion of tho serious
aspects attending tho chango of tho
mode of selecting presidential electors
adopted by the state of Michigan. That
statesmen aro fully alive to the vital
importance of the question is mani
fested by their reference.! to tho Presi
dent's iiinely remarks, and, in most
instances, their approval of his manner
<>! dealing with it. All feel, as tho
President does, that tho question is a
grave one, and his recommendations
have sot many to thinking. There is
nothing in tho message that appeals
so strongly to tho patriotic iinpulse.s^of
tho American people as thistopic which
he chose to form tho concluding portion
of his address, and nothing in it will do'
moro to arouse the public to a sense of
the duty of Congress. It remains to bo
koou whether tho Democratic majority
will heed tho warning of tho President
or allow their partisanship to blind
their judgment.
PLEASED Til KM ALL.
The mossago is complimented by moil
in both branches of Congress, notalonu I
for its originality of ideas and new mat- '
tor, but for its business qualities. It. is
on overy hand taken as an appeal to I
the Americans of our country and their |
hotter senso oi judgment, fathor than j
their political nroludlccs. Tho mcssajro
wns attentively listened to by men in
all parties wlion rend beforo Congress,

Wahiiingtox, D. G\, Doe. 9,?Thero is
ono Democrat in tho house whom tho
party mnnagera would cheerfully un
load, considering that they can spare
Homo members without impairing the
efliciency of their majority. Tho Dem
ocrat referred to is Sherman lloar, of
Massachusetts, an irrepressible young
man who threatens to llood the country
with manifestoes concerning what ho
will do and wny he will do it.
l'rom appearances he is tilled with
tho idea that tho whole responsibility
for legislation in tho house is upon his
shoulders, and ho would lileo it known
that ho has taken up tho burden. This
explanation of why he did not vote for
Crisp for speaker disgusted tho old
Democratic war horses, whilo it tickled
the Republicans, and they are encourag
ing him to go ahead and do it somo |
more.
Young Hoar's ellYontery is amazing,
and those who watched the progress of
the speakership contest got a full view
of it. llis first pronuneiamento was
tli.it Mills must bo elected. This was
forwarded from Massachusetts.\ Tho
untcrrificd young statesman followed up
his formal declaration by coming to
Washington to personally assist the |
Texas candidate. With his colleague, I
Williams, hoplanted himself down in
Mi. Mills's headquarters,and proceeded
to impair that gentleman's chances of I
success bv undertaking to elect him
with very littloassistaneo from Mr. Mills's
other advisers, lloar was rarely ab
sent.
He watched like a hawk for arriving
members and poured into their ears
"tho logic of the situation" before the
visitors had even timo to pay their re
spects to the candidate. In tho same
room, perhaps, would be men of na
tional standing, like Breckenridge, of
Kentucky, Wilson, of West Virginia,
ex-Speaker Carlisle and William K.
Morrison. Hut the Yankee youth de
sired to do all the conversing, and these
older ami more disti nguished friends of
the candidate had to take a back seat
in his presence. .
Jn tiie house he has now started oil'
on ItlU same lofty mission of doing it
all himself, and " he promises to be an'
amusing tiguro for the next two years
unless no learns something in tho
meantime. The apology for Mr. Hoar
is that he has the worthy^ ambition to
show the country that New Kngland
has produced a Democrat with as much,
if not more, force and ability as ex
Speaker Keed.

AtS o'clock another fatal fire was
raging in 1\ A. Menu & Co.'s wholesale
candy and fancy grocery house, a square
above the Boone Paper Company's
building. The origin of tho lire is a
mystery. Forty girls were at work
wrapping candy 011 tho fourth lloor and
all were not able to escape. The lire
was out at 11 o'clock and then the work
of taking out the bodies began. -The
bodies 01 six girls were soon taken out,
burned beyond recognition. Ct. T.
Menu, brother of the senior member of
the linn, was burned to death, and the
I liremen think at least live other nirls
will be found as soon as the hot embers
will permit a thorough seurch. Tho
firo cut oll' escapo by tho stairway lead
ing from the fourth story, where the
girls were at work; majiy jumped from
the windows to a second story projec
tion and escaped with broken limbs
and bruised bodies. Others got out un
hurt.
The lire originating in tho Boone
Pancr Co.'s building was supposed to bo
fully extinguished a little after i> o'clock
last night, and later all tho engines
were withdrawn. Tho ladder men were
1110 only men left. They were watching
the adjacant buildings.

Tho four men were in the Bamberger,
Strong & Co. building about twenty
minutes before o'clock this morning.
The lire in Mcnn 6c Co.'s storo is sup
posed to have arisen from one of the
candy furnaces, which possibly ex
ploded. At any rate tho flumes' com
municated with tho now and big stock
oi Christinas fire-works.
The bodies taken out are so charred
and blackened that identification is so
far impossible. Great confusion exists.
Main street, where the principal whole
sale traffic of tho city goes on, is block
aded audthe business almost at a stand
still.
Tho loss on Mcnn & Co.'s building
and stock is placed at $S3,000, and the
total loss will bo nearly three-quarters
of a million. Tho flames were stopped
at Geo. W. Wicks & Co.'s cotton house.
Tho bodies of the girls were romoved as
soon as possible to the nearest under
taking establishment.
Later?Five bodies have been re
covered. Three of these recovered are:
Amelia Dickey, -Mary Welsh, Barbara
Bell. Two not identified are supposed
to be Lou Kern, Clara Bauscli.
Gangs of workmen havo been busy
in the ruins of the fire 011 Main street
since the flames wore subdued and are
still busy. At Mean's, tho candy
factory, 517 West Main, whore ton
wore entombed by the crashing walls, |
tho only unusual -sight from without
is a pile of wreckage in the street. In
side under the edge dripping, broken
floors and rafters. Twenty feet from i
the front oi the buiMing laborers are
still digging towards the cellar and
searching for the bodies of tho missing.
Tho mass is still smouldering and there
is no hopo for any. At 10 o'clock tho I
body of Charles Keramel, tho partner
in fciio Jinn, was rescued at the candy
factory, and a little later two bodies
supposed to be those of Clara Houcli
ami Wm. llutzcmeior. This leaves
three more supposed to be in tho ruins
at that point. *

Sir. {MnriiiN Admit* Having Violated l!ls
IMarrlt/go Vows with tin Actrrs*.
London, Dec. 1).?When tlio hearing
in the St. John divorcu caso was re*
Mimed this morning the usual crowd of
actors and actresses wan prcsont to
listen to the revelations. Miss St. John
to-day, as usual, via very handsomely
and becomingly dressed. When her
side of the <"i3o was closed Mr. (.'ill
made his address in buhaif of Mr.
Marius.
Mr. .Marina, through his counsel, had
already admitted theeharyo of adultery
made against him, hut claims that this
violation of his marriage vows was not
until a year after his wife had left him.
The first evidence (submitted on the
ojiening of the court to-day was a depo
sition mndo by the actress. Xila St.
Gcorye. This was read to tlm court
mill jury with the object of proving that
Mr. .Marius had eonnnitted the (statu
tory offenso before the Until separation
occurred between Miss Si. .Joliu and
himself. This deposition was read to
the court and jury by Sir Charles Rus
sell, who represents Miss St. John.
Among other things, Miss St. George,
in her deposition, stated that Mariits
was in tlio habit of visiting the actress,
Marie Luella, in her boudoir and at tlio
Avenue theatre. Upon one occasion
he had told Miss St. George to look
after Marie Luella, as she belonged to
him.
This concluded the evidence for Miss
St. John, and Mr. Gill then arose and
addressed the jury in behalf of Mr.
Ma rins.
Mr. (Sill declared he would prove Miss
St. John and Mr. Arthur Cohen had
been together under circumstances that
could only lead to the conclusion that
improper relations existed between
tliem.
Mr. Gill then called Mr. Marius to the
witness box. After bcinx duly sworn,
he, in response to questions put him by
Mr. (.iill, denied his wife's charge that
lie had contributed to her support. Mr.
Marius was very emphatic in his asser
tion that lie is still very fund of his
wife. Adjourned.

P.mus, Dec. 9.?In the senate to-day,
M. Dide, who is a Protestant clergyman,
interpellated the government on the at
titude of the Catholic,bishops, lie de
scribes tlio bishops as attacking tho
laws of the republic and working to es
tablish tho temporal power of the
papacy, and tho priests us evading
every obligation of the concordat. It
was high time, he added, that the gov
ernment put a stop to such anarchy.
M. Fallieres, minister of justice, re
plied to the interpellation, lie said that
tho'govcrnment favored a policy of ap
peasement. The provisions of the con
cordat were ainplv sufficient to recall
the close, and to a sense of the respect
they owe the constitution. Shonid these
provisions prove inadequate, however,
the government would ask parliament
to authorize other measures.
liv a vote of 211 to 570 the senate
adopted an order oftheday pledging the
government to avail itself of its rights
to compel t ho clergy to respect the re
public, and to submit to the laws.
