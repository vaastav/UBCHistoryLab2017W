I Summary of tbe Postmaster General's
Report.
New York, Dec. 3.?The following is
a summary of the Postmaster General's
report:
The expenditures for the year exceed
the receipts f965,093; the increase of
revenue compared with tho previous
year was per cent., and increase of
expenditures 12 per cent., including a
standing appropriation for free mail
matter of $700,000, a legitimate portion
of tho revenue is yet remaining unexpended;
the actual deficiency for the
past year is only $265,093; the aggregate
length of mail routes in operation
the past year was 180,921 miles. During
the year much of the service in the late
insurgent States was in operation only
part of tho year; the net postal liabilities
from these States, while in operation,
exceed the receipts by $75,383;
there has been an increase the past
year in those States of 1,010 routes, 41,872
miles, and $1,137,367 annual cost;
more than one-half of the mail routes
in those States have been put in operation,
comprising nearly nine-tenths of
the railroad routes; the contractors have
been fined ?50,302 for delinquencies.
There has been an increase in"the
postage, upon the correspondence
exchanged with foreign countries,
amounting to $4G9,2iK). A liberal
postal convention has been concluded
with Italy and Venezuela. A basis
for a new convention with Great Britain
lias been agreed upon containing
many advantages. A convention with
Brazil is also proposed. Considerable
space is devoted to the mail steamship
lino to Japan and China. The Postmaster
General concurs with his predecessor
in the opinion that the steamships
of the main line between San
Francisco, Japan and China ahould not
be required to touch at the Sandwich
Islands; but Congress must determine
the conditions of release. Ho nr^es a
liberal policy toward the enterprise.?
The free delivery in operation in fortysix
of the principal cities is working
satisfactorily. The number of money
order offices in operation is 710 against
347 last year, and 67 more are to be established
in the Pacific States and Territories.
The business, compared with
that of last year, lias almost trebled.
He recommends further legislation
upon the subject to correct the inconsis
tencies and for the improvement of
the system. Much space is devoted to
miscellaneous matters.
1
New York, December 2.?A special
from Boston to tho World says: Tho
Fenian Brotherhood here have regularly
organized, and are receiving full
equipments for infantry, cavalry and
artillery discipline.
There is no doubt but that James
Stephens is on French soil, giving directions
to the movements in Ireland
and in this country. His arrival in
Paris is known in this city. The present
effort of the Fenians to redeem their
Isle has the sympathy of tho French
Emperor, and it will not be astonishing
to learn that the C. O. I. R. is in
clandestine communication with his
compatriots in Ireland, at the hands of
French police, manipulated, for that
purpose.
A dispatch in peculiar cipher agreed
upon when Mr. Stephens left New
York has been received from the Great
Organizer, containing important information
not yet made public, but which
will be given at the proper time. It is
supposed to relate to the exact time
when the Fenians shull start on their
mission to Canada, the number of
stations to be made by the Western Fenians
in Canada and the movement of
the New England Fenians against the
condemned Fenians. It is a successful
pan whereby he is enabled to advise
and be advised In all important matters.
Tho collection of arms still continues
here.

In his speech at the caucus yesterday,
Mr. Boutwell said that Congress would
not be faithful to its trust if it did not
thoroughly investigate the official actions
ot Andrew Johnson since he became
President.
New York, Dec. 3d.?A correspondentat
Milledgeville, Ga., wiitesthatthe
reasons for the rejection of the Constitutional
amendment by the Legislature
ot that State were that there were no
guarantees given that the admission of
the State to the Union would follow its
adoption, and that the people consider
it the height of ingratitude to disfranchise
those who were lately their soldiers.
They have began to look calmly
at the possibility of negro suffrage as a
means of re-admission, but it is still
revolting to them.
A bill has been under consideration
in the Legislature looking to the establishment
of common schools for the
whites and blacks throughout the
State, and will probably be passed.
Emigration from the North is encouraged,
and much capital has ulready
flowed in from that section.

the seats of Executive and Judicial
power, and with no disposition to flattery,
we may be permitted to say that a
nation saved bears testimony that we
tender no mistaken regard; a nation
saved from the conspiracies of European
powers; saved from the
parricidal efforts of domestic foes; saved
from bankruptcy; saved from slavery;
a nation saved, not in its sins, but from
its sins; a nation saved in all its liberties
at home, to be and continue the
prophet of liberty for the world, and
that nation transferred in the catalogue
of nations, by the very process of its
trials, from an experimental to a permanent
and paramount power. These
results, made painfully clear by the
national trials, fresh in the memory of
all, through which the Republic has
passed, and is passing to certain triumph,
together with its young, unihtimidated
fidelity to p'rinciple and
Roman firmuess in its defence, command
the honor of our own personal
and political regard. Much has been
done, much remains to bo done. It
has been not inaptly said, that this is a
Government of the people,by the people,
and for the people; that people have
spoken at the ballot-box, in our
theory of Government, the source of
power. In their electoral judgment,
they have demanded that the ways of
the nation shall be re-adjusted in such
wise as to assure personal liberty to all,
without regard to color or condition.
In the light of this deliberate and emphatic
verdict of the people, made inevitable
by the memories of sacrifices
and blood, you are admonished to
guarantee by law that the great national
trust shall be administered in tho
spirit of universal liberty. It is not our
fprovince or purpose to suggest what
aws should be made. The significance
of our tender of hospitality is an expression
of our implicit confidence that
whatever is needed to bo enacted into
law, within the Constitution, will bo
accomplished through your legislative
deliberation, and the nation, born
again, will go on in its high career of
political and material prosperity.
Mr. Colfax replied as follows:
Fellow-citizens?-Only four months
have passed away since the first session
of the Congress ended, and the members
whom you now greet with such
generous and earnest welcome, returned
to their homes to render an account of
their stewardship to the people, and to
discuss before that tribunal, from
which there is no rightful appeal, the
gravest issue ever submitted on the
battle field, to which treason invited
the nation. Our heroic defenders, amid
the storm of shot and shell and flame,
on sea as well as on shore, had
triumphantly decided that our stargemmed
banner should never become
the winding-sheet of the world's best
hopes, but after their conflicts and their
sacrifices, it still remaiued for the people
at the ballot-box, and the people's
Representatives and Senators in these
Halls of Legislature, to guard the Republic
effectually against another rebellion
drenching the land in blood,
and after this terrible contest for
national existence, to reconstruct.
on 8uch an enduring corner-stone
that posterity should realize to the
latest syllable of recorded time,
that our fallen heroes had not died in
vain, but four mouths ago we left the
Capital and yet how crowded with
events. The bloody, wicked, massacre
at New Orleans the very week after our
adjournmentaud the extract of u speech
of the President at St. Louis palliating
the guilt of the murderers and charging
the grave responsibility 011 the Congress
of the United States. Two great
Philadelphia Conventions are remarkable
for the frank acknowledgment that
those who denounced Congress were
really arm-in-arm with the men who,
triumphing in broken oaths. had
sought to destroy the nation's life
and the other honored by the presence
of the fuithful loyalists who, when the
Btorm ot treason swept over their
States, refused to bow the knee to
Baalarn; the expulsion from office of
thousands trusted and commissioned
by our martyred President to whom
wore man any otner equal number of
meu,tbe present administration was indebted
for the power it wielded, their
prime being, indexible fidelity to the
principles professed by the successful
candidate for Vice President in the canvass
1864; the hundreds of speeches of
this Presidential tour throughout the
land, and their republication in millions
of copies of all our prominent
press, bringing the issues to the hearthstone
of every voter. The maghiiicent
response of the people from
ocean to ocean condemning the
policy of which they had heard so
much and attesting their unshaken confidence
in Congress which had stood so
faithfully, so fearlessly and so immovably
in the pathway of duty and right.
How rapidly have we been making
history in the past few mouths. Thank
God in this land the people are only
rulers. Every two years tney resume
their sovereigbty and by the ballot-box
they make and unmake Cougress and
they approve or condemn administrations.
They command and Congress
and the President must obey. We return
then to the hall to carry out and
enforce the decision of the rulers of the
nation?the people. No man can misunderstand
their will. Four points
have been settiled by them beyond controversy.
\
1st, That the work of restoration
must be in the hands of those who have
been their friends, not enemies of the
nation.
2d, That it must be based upon
the granite of loyalty, and not
upon the quicksands of disloyalty, and
that with the privileges and iintnuni'
ties of the liberty granted by the nation
to all people.
3d. That no person shall be disfran- i
chised in the reptlblic on account of
their race, and have their numbers
couuted to confer increased political
power in those disfranchising them.
4th. That the national debt, the cost
of our uational existence, shall be forever
sacred, and that all debts or claims 1
growing out or tne rebellion or breaking
off that ended it, shall be forever
held illegal and void, and the people
ieolared their desire and will that Congress
should enforce this discussion of
theirs by appropriate legislation. For 1
these few but vital points were from
aveiy consideration of revenge or
malice, looking only as they did to public
justice and the public safety, and ,
aven more generous than just. It was 4
certainly to have been expected that if i
there was in the region, where those {
who had warred on the country so bit- J
terly, any returning love for the Union,
ny sorrow for their crimes, these essential
requirements would have been
assented to promptly, or if not promptly,
as soon as the elections had maniTested
the nation's will; but on the
jontrary they are spurned and f
icornfolly neglected by those who j
control public opinion and wield polit- J
ical power in the South, and the recent t
election of the most conspicuous seces- ]
rionists in North Carolina, Alabama, <
Arkansas, ?fcc., with the hostile messages
of their Governors, and defiant
replies regarding the Constitutional ji
Amendment. They show that they in- j \
sist on representation in Congress, and j
an electional college for all the four!
millions of their iormer slaves, thus I
according to the enlarged and increas- <
id law making power in consequence ;
if the rebellion, while at the same {
time they not only disfranchise them,
but refuse them the rights and protection
of citizenship by disgraceful and J
oppressive laws, pretending to regulate e
labor and contracts, and to pnnish va- s
grancv, reducing those whom the na- J
ion made freemen, to a subservience !
serfdom but little, if better, than slavery
itself, while we cannot compel
them to approve the Constitutional ?
Amendment. Our duty to the nation, '
:>ur justice to liberty and to humanity 1
is none the less, and as the exponents of 1
the people's will, as we are, we cannot
avoid that duty. Indeed we may gee
Lhe finger of Providence, like our forefathers,
in the past lour years, we have
builded better than we know. In the
earlier stages of the war how willingly
would an overwhelming majority of
the people have consented to perpetuate
slavery in the republic, if the Southern
traitors had taken from our lips the
bloody chalice of civil war, which
they compelled us to drain to
its very dregs. Qod willed it otherwise.
At last, when every family
altar had been crimsoned with
blood, and every cemetery and churchyard
was crowded with patriot graves,
the nation rose in a higher duty, and
resolved in these Halls that slavery
should die. Then the stormy clouds
of war passed away, God's smile shone
on our banners, victory after victory
blessed our gallant armies, and thecrowning
triumph was one that gave
salvatiou to the union and freedom to
the slaves. Since thut we have been
earnestly struggling for reconstruction
on some enduring and lOyal foundation.
Stumbling-blocks have impeded
our progress, and when at last a mild
and magnanimous proposition is made,
embodying no confiscation, no banishment,
no penalties of otTcuded law, ve
are baffled by a hardening of heart |
against it, inexplicable as it seemed ir- '
removable. Does it not seem as if
again the Creator is leading us in
his way rather thau our own, and as we
turn for light does it not Hash upon us
luni uf itgum requires me nation 10 conquer
its prejudices. That us he so far
above us has put all human being under
an equality before divine law and
called them his children, he demands
that we shall put all under an equality
before human law so that every one in
the region personed by the influence of
slavery and principles of treason shall
be clothed with all the rights necessary
for tho fullest and surest protection
against tyranny, outrage and wrong, |
and not left defenceless at the mercy of
those who so long exhibited no mercy i
to the Government the3T sought to destroy.
The question naturallj* arises, j
how can this be done surrounded by
the able jurists and patriot statesmen
returning here as thejr do, crownedjwitli
au unparalleled popular endorsement. |
It might not be fitting to anticipate
their argumeuts on these vital themes
in the session just opening, but when
tho Constitution declares in its opening
sentence that all tho legislative powers
herein granted shall be vested in a Congress
of the United States; when it solemnly
enjoins that tho United States
shull guarantee to every State in the
Union a republican form of government;
when itgives to Congress full authority
to make all laws which shall be
necessary and proper for carrying into
execution all tho powers vested by
this Constitution in tho Government
of the United States or in any Department
or officer thereof. The duties and
its exercises both seem to havo been
specifically anticipated by the creation
of our supreme law. Since President
Johnson declared in May, 1865, that tho
rebellion had destroyed all tho government
in tho rebellious States, Congress
iiOQ ro/>nn>nl?n?1 ?">" ? ??
uunu u> lumi ^uvfruments,
and established theai under
the authority of military law. Except
tho rebel disfranchising government of
the State of Tennessee, it has yet to settle
the question under the oaths of its
members to support and defend the
Constitution; whether those provincial
and unrecognized governments in
which those who have been the bitterest
enemies of the Republic are dominant
in the executive, judicial and legislative
departments; where to have been a soldier
of the Union, either living or dead,
is a reproach; where devotion to the lost
cause of treason is openly avowed is the
guarantee of popular favor; where the
colors and the heroes of tho rebellion
are enthusiastically hailed.
SynopslM of the Report or the Necretary
of the TreuMury.
New York, Dec. 3.?Tho following in
a summary of the report of the Secretary
of the Treasury:

have fallen short of the estimates $20,052.n23.fLW.

diminution in tho internal taxes, and
says tho present generation, with proper
economy, can pay the debt. He
regrets notwithstanding the large reduction
of the national debt and the
satisfactory condition in other respects
of the national treasury, that little progress
has been made since hislast report
toward specie payments. He explains
at length his action concerning the disposal
of the surplus gold. He recommends
that the national banks be compelled
to redeem at a single Atlantic
city curtailment of the currency?careful
revision of the tariff to make it
harmonize without internal taxes the
issue of 20 year or less of bonds at 5
percent., payable in England or Germany,
to an amount sufficient to absorb
the 6 per cent, bonds now held in Europe,
and to meet the demand there for
actual and permanent investment and
the rehabilitation of tho Southern
States. He urges these recommendations
at length, and says he is of the
opinion that Hpecie payments may be
resumed and ought to be resumed as
early as the first day of July, 1S63. The
public debt October 31, I860, exclusive
ofthecashin the treasury, was $26S,163,696,634;
cash in the treasury $13,032,696,062.
As to the commercial intercourse
with tho British Americas, tho
Secretary advertes to his opinion that
until our revenue system is fully revised
and adjusted to tho financial situation
of the country, this subject
should not be placed beyond the control
of Congress, but should be left to
concurrent legislation, and such regulations
as may be authorized by law to
prescribe. The remainder of the report
is devoted to statistical details.
