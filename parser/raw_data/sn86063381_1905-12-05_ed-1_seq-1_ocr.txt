Washington, Dec. 5. President
Roosevelt's message to Congress was

Corporation!.
I am in no sense hpstile to corpora
tions. This is an age of combination,
and any effort to prevent all combina
tion will be not only useless, but in the
end vicious, because of the contempt
for law which the failure to enforce
law inevitably produces. The corpora
tion has come to *t. y, just as the
trades union has come to stay. Fach
can do and has done great good. Each
should be favored so long as it does
good. But each should be sharply
cheeked where it acts against law and
justice.
Experience has shown conclusively
that it is useless to try to get any ade
quate regulation and supervision of
these great corporations by state ac
tion. Such regulation and supervision
can only be effectively exercised by a
sovereign whose jurisdiction is coex
tensive witft the field -work of the cor
porationsthat is, by the national gov
ernment. I believe that this regulation
and supervision can be obtained by the
enactment of law by the congress. If
this proves impossible, it will certainly
be necessary ultimately to confer in
fullest form such power upon the na
tional goyern:"
ment of the constitution.
The laws of the congress and of the
several states hitherto, as passed upon
by the courts, have resulted more often
In showing that the states have no
power in the matter tban that the na
tional government has power so that
there at present exists a very unfortu
nate condition of things, under which
these great corporations doing an in
terstate business occupy the position of
subjects without a so\ereign, neither
any state government nor the national
government having effective control
over them. Our steady aim should be
by legislation, cautiously and carefully
undertaken, but resolutely persevered
in, to assent the sovereignty of the na
tional government by affirmative nc-lj"
tion.
This is only in form an innovation.
In substance it is merely a restoration,
for from the earliest time such regula
tion of industrial activities has been
recognized in the action of the Iaw-,
making bodies, and all that propose

state traffic as shall summarily and ef
fectively present the imposition of un
just or unreasonable rates. It must
include putting a complete stop to re
bates in every .shape and form. This'
power to regulate rates, like all similar
powers over the business world, should
be exercised with moderation, caution
and self restraint, but it should exist,
so that it can be effectively exercised I
when the need arises.
In my judgment, the most important'
provision which such law IioulU con
tain is that conferring upon some com
petent administrative body the power
to decide upon the case being brought 1
before it whether a given rate pre
scribed by a railroad is reasonable and
just, and If it is found to be unreason
able and unjust then, after full investi
gation of the complaint, to pre&cribe
the limit of rate beyond which it shall
not be lawful to gothe maximum

heavy penalty should be exacted from
any corporation which fails to respect
an order of the commission. I regard
this power to establish a maximum
rate as being essential to any scheme
of real reform in the matter of railway
regulation.
It is worth while considering whether
it would not be wise to confer on the
government the right of civil action
against the beneficiary of a rebate for
r.t least twice the value of the rebate.
This would .help stop what is really
blackmail. Elevator allowances should
be stopped, for they have now grown
to such an extent that they are demor
alizing and are used as rebates.
,.J Private Car Lines. i
All private car lines, industrial roads,
refrigerator charges and the like
should be expressly put under the su
pervision of the interstate commerce
commission or some similar body so
far as rates and agreements practical
ly affecting rates are concerned. A re
bate in icing charges or in mileage or in
a division of the rate for refrigerating
charges is just as pernicious as a re
bate in any other way.
There should be publicity of the ac
counts of common earners. Only in
'this way can violations or evasions of
the law be surely detected. A system

in a reasonable time and to obtain
from thence onward, subject to review
by the courts.
It sometimes happens at present, not
that a rate is too high, but that a fa
vored shipper is given too low a rate.
In such case the commission would
have the right to fix this already estab
lished minimum rate as the maximum,
and it would need only one or two such
decisions by the commission to cure
railroad companies of the practice of
giving improper minimum rates. 1 call
your attention to the fact that my pro
posal is not to give the commission
power to initiate or originate rates gen-
