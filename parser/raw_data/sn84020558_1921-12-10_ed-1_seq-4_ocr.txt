the avidity with which the large brokers syndicates of

The heavy premium of more than 1300,000, being

The League of tree Southwest
Riverside, California, appears not to have been
the best location for the holding of the conference of
the League ot the Southwest on the subject of the
fcaading ot the Boulder Canyon dam and the dispo
itica t the maters and the power of the Colorado
river. i . '
Though the conference can settle nothing, and,
ferhaps. cannot greatly Influence a final settlement
Vbere is a possibility that such an influence might be
exerted. Outside ot the Califomlans we suppose the
cicgate who assembled at Riverside took with
them a purpose to mould an influence which would
be beneficial, if at all, to all states alike.
They expected the states would have an equal
representation la the convention. It never occurred
to them that they might be voting in the conference
against the entire population of southern California
Cl which Riverside is rather central point, conven
lent ot access. In such circumstances the delegates
from other states might as well have remained at
atom and permitted the Callfomians .to change the
trie and title of the organization to the "League of
E-oathern California.".
The needs of southern California may be greater
bet one's rights are not to be determined by his needs.
Such a league as that of the southwest is indis
fhtasable. The. states composing It are all concerned
In the disposition of the waters of the Colorado. As
ro other part of the country Is concerned, no doubt
tha government will be guided by ' any agreement
-hlch these states may make. If they should hope
lessly divide they would all be powerless. We think
that the southern Callfornlans will recede rather than
rroToke a division.
As A Guarantor of France
TLe Literary Digest has sent a questionnaire to
newspapers throughout the country to ascertain the
attitude of the American people toward a proposi
tion to go to the defense of France in case of foreign
aggression; and in the case of their willingness, to
eiermlne whether the attitude of the country should .
t-a expressed in a treaty. We assume that by "ag
(ressicn," "German aggression" Is meant by the
Digest.
We believe that the sentiment over the country
would faror a guaranty of France against a retalia
tory attack by Germany, for two reasons. One of
them is the ancient obligation which is popularly un
derstood to bind tills country to France whether such
an obligation actually exists or has ever existed. The
other is, that in a sense the integrity ot France
against aggression by Germany was one of the Is
sues f the World War. though It was not stated to
t-e an issue. Nor was it even remotely hinted that
the United Statea went Into the war to save France.
We do not think though that the people of the
felted States would enter into a treaty with France
or any other power, which might become an "en-
. . . i : . i 'A
tangling alliance. Any treaty to wiucu we. muu
become a part would have to be framed for a sin
gle definite purpose not to assist France in any
war ia which France might engage; nor a war even
with Germany for the enforcement of the provisions
cf the Versailles treaty, but only a war for the pre
servation of the territorial integrity of France against
unprovoked German aggression. v
One thing that might the more readily Induce Us
Into such an arrangement is the apprehension of
France, to which The Republican many weeks ago
called attention, concerning the military preparations
pf Germany. Since then the subject has been laid by
France before the conference on limitation of arma
ment. That France's apprehension Is not ground
less is apparent and that France should oppose any
Auction of its land forces, In the face of this danger
is only natural.
It would, therefore, we believe, be proper for not
aly the Cnited States, but the other parties to the
conference to reassure France against such a danger,
though those of the parties which are parties 'o the
Versail'es treaty are already bound o France in such
aa emergency and are also bound to it in case of any

It is the unexpected that makes life worth living.
If we knew every morning what the day would
bring forth; If we could foresee all the humdrum
things that would happen to us human existence
would become so dull that we would want to end It
Most of us would not have patience to await the na
tural intervention of death. Life would be a game
with ail the cards exposed.
If In our intercourse with our neighbors we
should know in advance just what they were going
to say or do we would come to hate the sight of them.
There are some such individuals. When we se"e .them
coming we know -what they are going to talk about.
We know just what language they are going to use,
we know their mannerisms. We are promised no
surprise, pleasing or thrilling; we are going to leara
nothing new. So we know that we are goir.g to be
bored.
No doubt when old Cato used to get up every &iy
and write on the wall. ''Carthago delenda est," his
associates though at first interested, lapsed first Into
a state of amusement whence they passed into ore
of tolerance toward a "nut" A little later we sup
pose some of the senators grew so wearied that they
absented themselves from the forum until Cato bad
subsided.
Now there is Senator-Pat Harrison of Mississip
pi who immediately after the presidential election of
1920, declared his unalterable hostility to the Repub
lican administration and announced an unswerving
policy of obstruction, as the best service he could
render not to the country but to his party.
- Therein of course Senator Pat was in error, aa
error, though, common to small politicians and small
newspapers, the continual nagging of the opposition.
Senator Pat stands almost alone in the senate in
the pursuit of this policy. While perhaps other
democratic senators may not be averse to seeing the
administration in a hole, they are not conspicuously
trying to put it in one. And to the credit of the large
majority of the opposition, the senators are trying to
help the administration, indulging In criticism, if at
all, only when they believe criticism to be warranted
and constructive.
But when Senator Pat opens his mouth he un
corks criticism which ha Intends to be obstructive,
though so far he has succeeded in obstructing noth
ing. Naturally he embraced the opportunity afforded
by the president's message which was as clear and
Impartial an exposition of the "State of the Union"
as could have been expressed, to assail the adminis
tration, not hesitating to indulge in gross and ir
relevant misrepresentation in the statement that the
president had previously attacked the soldiers bonus.
Senator Pat has become a bore and a nuisance alike
to the two sides of the chamber.
Treaty Making
The Prescott Courier contraverts a statement by
The Republican, that a' president cannot make a
treaty. We will stick to it. Now let us see. There
Is a Versailles treaty and It was made, but where?
Not in the Hall of Mirrors by President Wilson,
Lloyd George. Clemenceau, Orlando and the rest t
them. It was only negotiated there and there every
thing that President Wilson did with reference to the;
treaty was ended. He had only power to negotiate
and never before had a president of the United States
exercised that power in person.
The treaty was hot a treaty when the power of
the president was exhausted. It was made elsewhere.
In various places, it was "made in Germany" in part,
but the United States had nothing to do with Its
making. And it was not made until three powers had
collaborated.
So if President Wilson "made" a treaty we
should lika to know where in America it Is now.
This talk of scrapping millions of dollars worth
of warships would be alarming to us but for the fact
that we got used to the wholesale scrapping of war
material just after the war whole acres of aeroplanes
and automobiles.

ing Sun of Tuma was printed last Wednesday is not
to be understood to be Indicative of the state of mind
in that vicinity.

The study of newspapers is In the curriculum
of West Point military academy. The cadets are
required to read two dailies as part of their class

after breakfast and the cadets are quizzed orally on
the day's news. Then they summarize the Important
happenings, domestic and foreign, and explain their

The "Strangers" allery of the British House
of Commons is acatr open to the public. It was closed
when the Sinn Fein alarm became most acute in England.
By Frederic J. Haskin
WASHINGTON, D. C, Dec 8. One
evening about 8 o'clock three women
sat chatting in the parlor of a house
ia Springfield, Massachusetts, when
a man entered the room by a rear
window and, without any Pvellmin
aries, demanded money. He wore a
black slouch -hat. a black handker
chief over the lower part of his face
and a revolver in a holster at bis
side.
The terrified women screamed. He
told them to be quiet or he would
kill them. One of them screamed
again, whereupon he shot hey.
through the heart, killing her In
stantly. Then, after some more
flourishes of his weapon, and with
out having taken any booty, he went
away.
This astonishing crime led, after a
long search, to the arrest of one
Bertram G. Spencer, who confessed
not only to this murder but also to
a long series of mysterious burglaries
which had terrified Springfield. They
were most peculiar burglaries. They
were committed usually- early in the
evening when detection would seem
almost certain. In some cases noth
ing was taken and in most cases only
- articles of little or no value.
Spencer was tried, and after a long
wransrie amone specialists as to
whether he was sane, he was con
demned to death and electrocuted.
One man at least was not satitified
with this trial. He is L. Vernon
Bribers, a well known specialist in
mental disease. He was convinced,
by what he had seen of Spencer and
what he had heard at the trial, that
Spencer was a defective. He further
believed that Spencer had been a de
fective all of his life, that any com
petent specialist in mental disease
could have diagnosed him as a man
who was dangerous at large. Fur
thermore. he realized that this coun
try must contain many thousands of
men like Spencer who are detective.
who are a menace to other persons
and to themselves, and yet are al
lowed to run at large. In these
opinions he has the support ot many
other psychiatrists.
Life Story of a Killer
In order to prove his case. Dr.
Brlggs made an elaborate study of
the life history of Spencer, and also
of those of two other convicted mur
derers of Czolgosz. the man who
murdered President McKinlcy, and of
one Rlcheson. These three studies
he has embodied in a book entrtled:
The. Manner of Man That Kills
This book, and especially the part of
it that deals with Spencer, Is an ab
solutely convincing demonstration of
the doctor's theorv that most men
Who kill are defective men. that if
studied by specialists when in school
thev could nearly all be recognized as
defectives and handled in such a way
that they would not be a menace to
society and to themselves, and that a
large part of the enormous expense
of our courts, police systems, and
ncnal institutions, could thus be
saved in addition to the great saving
In life and property.
Dr. BrigKs shows that Spencer was
defective in intelligence from ciuia-
hood, that almost all of his Immediate
relations on both sides showed some
signs of mental defect, many of them
having been downright insane. He
further shows that Spencer was long
known to many or his aaily asso
ciates as a "queer", man. and that it
was well recognized by them that he
was subject to outbursts of temper
almost without cause in which he

easy it generally Is to identify the
murderer before he murders. Dr.
Brlggs proceodu to give some in
formation as to what our system of
leaving defectives at large costs the
taxpayer. He shows that in Mass
achusetts $16,000,000, or 40 per cent
of the state budget in 1921, was
spent for the care of "defective, de
pendent and delinquent classes."
Courts for Madmen
In addition to this. It must be re
membered that the criminal courts
are engaged almost wholly in the
business of trying defectives, putting
them in jail and turning them loose
again. The trial of Spencer cost the
state of Massachusetts between $25.-
000 and $30,000, according to Dr.
Brlggs.
Remember, too, that our expensive
police forces are engaged chiefly In
keeping track 'of these defectives.
capturing them only to be released
again, playing an endless and futile
game of bide and seek with madmen.
This enormous burden which the
taxpayer carries and which is com
parable only with the burden of in
ternational armament, is in a sense
the least of the evils of our system
of handling crime. The worst evil
ot it is that we are breeding de
fectives steadily so that the prob
lem grows all the time and the blood
of the nation is vitiated by defective
strains everywhere, as the exam
ination of men for the draft con
vincingly shoved.
hat is neeticd to remedy the sit
uation is well known to students of
the situation and has been carried
out to a certain extent in , some
states and its practicability proved.
i.ach state should have an institu
tion which would not be known eith
er as a hospital or as a prison, bin
as a school to which all defectives
would be sent. They would there
be studied by the most competent
specialists and every effort would
be made to fit each of these defec
tives for a useful life In sooiety. Some
graduate from the school and most
of them presumably would not be al
lowed to propagate, but each of
them would be given as large a show
in the normal life of the world as
he was capable of bearing.
To this institution would be sent,
not only the defectives caught In the
net of the courts, but who are now
either legally killed or else turned
loose to do their worst, but also the
children identified as defectives in
the schools. This indeed is the most
Important part of the plan. For the
defective or psychopathic child,
taken in hand early and rescued
from unfavorable environmental in
fluences, may be converted into

One thing which stands In the
way of establishing such institutions
Is the lack of competent specialists
a lack which will doubtless gradually
be met by education. But the great
need is for a public opinion that re
alizes the need for such Institution

To the Editor:
During my' visit to Washington a
wile ago the people that has charge

of Columbia was all steamed up over
the way motorists was disobeying
the laws and what was to be done to
learn drivers a lesson and etc and
finely one of the commissioners or
something give It as his opinion that
the trouble was on acct. of the pen
alties not being severe enough, like
for Inst, most drivers would rather
shoot along about 25 to 30 miles per
hr. and run the slight risk ot getting j
arrested once in a wile rather than
always crawl along like a snail's pace
and never get nowberes in time for j
the cocktails. Make the punishment
fit the crime was this guy's slogan
and 2 ot his suggestions was as fol
lows: ' I
A motorist caught speeding in the
dist. should be made to draw up to
the curb and stay there 15 minutes
the cop to act as time keeper.
When a motorist parked his car in
a place where parking was not al
lowed, or parked too long in a place
where they was a time limit on park
ing, a special patent locking device
would be put on the car by the cop,
and the only keys to the lock would
be kept in the various police stations
and when the motorist come for his
car and found it locked, he would
half to go to the nearest police sta
tion and give proof that he was the
owner of the car and also put up as
much money as the police thought
the car was worth so in case it turned
out that he wasn't the owner, why
when the real owner showed up and
complained that his car had been
stole, they could give him the money
Instead of bothering to look for his
car. This cash bond would be left
in the station a wk. and if nobody
showed up in that time to say the
car was his. the dough would be re
turned to the guy that put it up.
Other Offenses
That is what the dist. commission
er suggested and I don't know what
they done with his suggestions but
If tliey really want to stop speeding
and illegal parking you can bet your
life that those two little amendments
to the constitution would do the
trick. But It seems to me like they
was other things that motorists does
which is at least as bad as driveing
too fast or parking in the wrong
place and these other things Is also
vs. the law but the offender gener
ally always gets let off with a fine
that don t mean nothing to him
whereas the right kind of punishment
along the lines suggested by the
Washington man would make him
think twice before he misbehaved
himself.
Like for Inst, the's a law In most
towns vs. driveing with a open muf
fler. The people that disobeys this
law Is always people that likes to
show off and make more noise than
anybody else, po as a penalty for
violations of this law I would first
cut their tongues out and then make
them spend a wk. in a boiler factory.
Or suppose a man is caught drive
ing past a standing still street car.
The way to cure him from this habit
would be to make him back up and
get on the car track behind the street
car and follow it around lor Z cays
or if he was caught driveing on the

week with nobody to talk to but a traffi

then see w hich could push the other
one off the track.
If a roan come along at night with
out r.o' tail light I would make him
back up 5 miles on the right side of
the road or if his head lights was too
bright I would wait till it was time
for the theaters to let out and then
mako him drive up and down Broad

motorist disobeying 2 or 3 laws at
once like for Inst, they was a prom
inent New Yorker got him name in
the papers a wile ago for speeding,
driveing on the left side of the street
and driveing wile intoxicated all at
the same time. I never seen it print
ed what they done to him, but I sup
pose he got fined $50.00 or a $100.00
which was just chicken food to him
you might say: What they ought to

sober up and then lock him in a
room for a wk. with nobody to talk

her husband or some other lady's
husband. Under the present system

Well, friends, you won't never stop
the wholesale murder of gents by the
opp. sex with no such methods as
that.
The way to stop it is for the news
papers and police to work together.
Let the last named arrest the murder

papers treat her the same as if she

nothing ail her life but good deeds;
