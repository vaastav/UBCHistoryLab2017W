JUST A WORD OF CAUTION
The Tribune is informed that th<f
City Council and the Caldwell Powe»
Co. are negotiating for more street
lights. The Caldwell Power Co. asks
for a three year contract. We would
warn the Council to bo careful in en
tering into contracts extending over
a period of years. Tho people of
Caldwell are still mindful of the five
year purchase clause in the present
franchise, and they are very much dis
posed to take advantage of that clause
at the expiration of, the present five
year period. No contract must be en
tered into that will tie the hands of the
city so that it cannot take advantage
of that clause in tho contract. The
council will not knowingly jeopardise
the interests of the people; but
thoughtlessly it might tie the hands
of the city. More electric lights
are needed, but not at the price of the
nullification of that purchase clause.
This matter should be carefully looked
into before the contract is finally
signed up. The provisions of the con
tract must not be such as will prove
ical to tba interest? of-the people
Sy come to take over the
Caldwell Power Company's plant.
The Tribune has perfect confidence in
the mayor and council, but thought it
no harm to caution them.
INDEPENDENT PARTY
The Tribune has it from men promi
nent in the Republican party, that
there may be another party in the field
during the next state campaign.There
is an element in both the Republican
and Democratic parties which fears
that the two parties will come out
for state-wide prohibition. If this
should happen the new party will be
organized. In case either the Repub
lican or Democratic parties, does not
come out for state-wide prohibition,
this element will support that party.
For the purpose of getting things in
readiness the "Taxpayers" are now
being organized throughout the state.
This organization will be developed
into a political party if occasion de
mands it. The idea will be to attrav.
the dissatisfied of all parties. The
fathers of the scheme are men who
hope to realize revenge upon members
of the Republican party who may get
the Republican nomination. The
Tribune thinks that little will come of
the idea. From a political stand
point we think the matter of little con
sequence. As an illustration of the
idle conceits and fancies of imagina

tion it is interesting. Hère are a num
ber of men who are organizing them
selves to fight a public sentiment that
has compelled the two leading political
parties of the state to adopt its idea.
The man of candor and intelligence
knows that the stand the Republican
party and Democratic party will take,
is dictated by an overwhelming pub
lic sentiment. The prohibition idea
is not a fundamental principle of
either of the two parties. Each will
have adopted it because of the de
mands of the people, if it be adopted at
all. To found a party upon nothing
except opposition to public sentiment
is certainly the most fantastic idea re
cently promulgated. The men behind
the plot must have a wonderful opin
ion of their own resources and prow
ers in things political, or else they
have failed to appreciate the Quixot
ism of their undertaking. Idaho men
have tried before to maintain political
organizations for personal revenge or
upon fictitious issues. In every case
oblivion has soon encompassed them
and their party. However, if some
daring man of prominence should call
a convention of diseft'eeted Republi
cans, he would undoubtedly have a
rousing meeting, because every dis
gruntled Republican In tho state
would be there. Ho might thus gath
together 500 or even 1000 men.
He would then have them all. About
two-thirds of them would be dissatis
fied with the arrangement in the new
organization, and the convention
would be the whole shpw, party, issue
and campaign. Thero it would end.
Persons of thought, know that success
ful political organizations aro founded
upon basic and fundamental princi
ples of government, or political econ
omy. It is the intangible sympathy of
ideas that makes and keeps organiza
tions intact. A new party can only
bo born, when both the old ones en
tirely fail to represent and express
public opinion. There never was yet
a man big enough to organize a party
of any consequence upon his personal
whims. Once the party be thoroughly
organized the whims of a strong man
may direct it for a.long time. After
people have got into the habit of doing
a thing a certain way or even voting
a certain way, it takes a cyclone to
chango them. Fixed habits are the
most immovable and unchangeable
things of society. Without an issue
an independent party is an impossibil
ity.
WANTED: A MOSES
Idaho has what some have been
pleased to call an anti-trust law. It
also possesses what are believed to
be a number of local trusts. Why
does not some self-sacrificing public
official first determine whether or not
these trusts exist, and, if he ascer
tains they do, set the anti-trust law
on them.
There is a well-founded suspicion
that in Boiso there are a number of
these combinations and that they are
responsible to a great measure for the
unnecessary high prices of certain nec
essaries. For example, the city health
officer refers to certain operations on
the p?rt of those who sell milk in this
city as having the "characteristics of
a milk trust." Perhaps there is a milk
trust. I^et some one get out the offi
cial probe. It certainly looks trust
like when the price of milk delivered
in the city jumps from $2.00 to $2.50
per quart per month with prospects
of an increase to $3.00 before spring.
The Statesman wants to know why
some trust buster don't get busy. We
will tell. There is not one of us who
wouldn't rather kill lions in Africa
than chaso brindle cows out of the
back yards. Thero is not one of us
that wouldn't rather choke the
Standard Oil Co. to death than inter
view our coal merchant. We are not
afraid. We've got nerve all right
but we don't like to create a sensation
in the immediate neighborhood.
POSTAL SAVINGS BANKS
In hia message' to congress Presi
dent Taft strongly recommends the
establishment of postal savings banks
by the Uniter States government, as
an encouragement to thrift upon the
part of the people. Thero can be no
question but that there is a strong
public sentiment throughout the Unit
ed States in favor of postal savings
banks; and if some postal savings
bank plan can be framed that will
admit of easy deposit and withdrawal
of money, it will be a great benefit
to the people. Bills have been intro
duced in congress for the establish
ment of postal savings banks, that
made deposit easy; but the method of
withdrawal was long, cumbersome
and barnacled with red tape. It is
not such an easy matter to frame
legislation along this line as it would
seem on first thought. The postal ser
vice cannot be turnedm to an immense
bank with every postoffice a branch
office. When the government under
takes to care for tha savings of the
people, and pay them interest on those
savings, it must also invest enough
of that money to pay the interest and
the expense of operation. The people
who would patronize the postal sav
ings banks are people of little exper
ience and very little money. They de
mand safety as tt)e first consideration,
and ease of access as the becond and
last consideration. The few dollars
they have put away for a rainy day,
is 131 instant demand upon the first ap
peaa-ance of trouble. It is noticeable
at every postoffice in the United
States when a little flutter disturbes
the finances of the country, the num
ber of people who will buy postal
money orders payable to themselves,
Thçse people want to place their mon
ey where it will bo safe; and where
they can easily get it. To do this
they are willing to pay a small fee.
The more stingy among this class
will stick their money in an old stock
ing behind the broom. To provide for
these people is the object of the postal
savings bank.
Political economists and authorities
on matters of this character, estimate
that the people of the United States
have tucked away under the carpet
ind in old boot's somewhere between a
quarter and a half billion dollars.
To get this vast sum of money back
into the legitimate channels of com
merce is a problem worthy the study
of the best statesmen of America.
To handle it when once in hand is an
other matter that requires deep study
and earnest consideration. The gov
ernment cannot loan out th>s money,
invest it or handle it like a state or
national bank does. It is neither de
sirable nor possible for the govern
ment to go into the banking business
at this time. President Taft, in his
message, says that the matter of in
vesting these savings "is not without
difficuties," but is hopeful that the
difficultés will and can be overcome.
It is not the intention to compete
with other banks in any wise. The
rato of interest paid upon these sav
ings will be so small as to discourage
the withdrawal of money from the
other banks, but it will encourage
the withdrawal of money from tin
cans and similar vessels of deposit.
To provide for the investments of the
savings and easy method of deposit
, ... , , - .„ ,
and withdrawal of money will be the
concern of congress at an early day.
Wo may expect, with reasonable cer
tainty, that the plan will be worked
out by some one, and the postal sav
ings bank an assured fact.
AWAY BACK TO TWIN FALLS
Tho Tribune and the Boiso Citizen
have been discussing the Idaho Carey
Act projects, and their effect upon
the Brady administration, for some
two or three weeks past. The people
if they should follow the wanderings
of the Citizen, would get lost in the
labyrinth. Tho Citizen will not
get down to brass tacks in the discue
sion of this proposition. It is always
flying off on a tangent that has noth
ing to do with the question at issue.
The Tribune is perfectly willing to
follow up these tangents, but would
like to arrive at some definite con
clusion some where or other. To be
gin at the beginning Tho Tribune
simply stated that under tho new di
rect primary law Governor Brady
would likely receive the Republican
nomination for governor and asked
what his-enemies could bring against
him. The Boise Citizen essayed the
task. It investigated and based its
arguments against the Republican ad
ministration on its Carey Act tran
sactions. Even on that tho best it
could do was to question the judgment
of tho governor and his associates.
The Tribune also questions that judg
ment, but insists upon ascribing
good motives, until bad ones are
shown. Tho Citizen does not care to
prove a case on actual facts, improper
motives, and even does not show bad
judgment, but contents itself with
rampling asperions on "automobile
rides," "the indifference of The Trib
une, and "incompetency." To cap the
climax the Citizen gets away back to
the original Twin Falls project, which
it claims "was the most expensive in
comparison of all th« irrigation pro
jects undertaken in Idaho." Perhaps
it was, but Governor Brady certainly
was not responsible for that. That
segregation and contract was made
by a simon-pure Democratic adminis
tration. We will leave the Citizen to
arguo that out with its Democratic
brethren. Perhaps Frank Martin
could give it some light; or, there is
Jule Bassett right at hand. He is
overflowing with information.
AN ELABORATE EXPLANATION
Last week The Tribune incidentally
mentioned the fact that war was im
pending between the Boise & Inter
urban Railway Co. on tho one side
and the Boise Valley & Idaho North
ern railroads on the other. Tho Tri
bune stated that "tho B. &. I. feels
that tho other two lines are looking
for a fight and is preparing to give
them one to a finish. Tho Dewey
road has acted about as contemptibly
as possible since the Interurban was
built. The recent action of the road
in changing to the winter schedule
seemed to have been dona with a view
to discommoding as many people as
possible."
Those few 'sentences have called
forth an elaborate defence by the
Nampa Leader-Herald, not only of
the Boise Valley and Idaho Northern
railroads, but ul the Oregon Short
Line railroad, and public service cor
j
porations generally. Thu public ser
vico corporations should certainly ap- ■
preciate the Leader-IIerald's kindly j
interests, though they will hardly ap- !
prove of its far-fetched reasoning. !
Tliu intention it; right, whatever may i
be the result. Tho Leader-Herald j
pays us the compliment of being j
"'possessed of ordinary intelligence."
We thank the Leader-Herald and as
sure it that wo will never deny it
"being possessed of ordinary intel
ligenee no matter how seriously we
may think it. We will not enter into
an attack on the Oregon Short Line
now and at this time, because it is
only the Idaho Northern Railway that
is in consideration. The Le.uler-Hor
aid states that it was not tho inten
tion of the Idaho Northern to discom
mode the public. We are glad to
t ain tili ; faei. "Good intentions are t
always commendable. K tho Nampa j
paper , will only convince the peoplo 1
that the road diefn't inconvenience th ■ '
people ail will be well. We give it ]
full credit now for good intentions*
and will bo pleased to give il full ei cd- |
it for good results when the Leader- i
Herald so shows them.
OUINTET OF CANDIDATES . j
There arc now five candidates in
the tield for the Republican noniina- '
tion for governor. According to the j
news columns ol' this issue of The
Tribune the people oi Latah county
are grooming Hon. M. E. Lewis. :
president of the Board of Regents o J
the State University, for the. race. In
case he decides not to make the cam
paign, they will put forward Hon.
Burton L. French, thrice congressman j
from Idaho. Then there, is Paul '
Clagstone of Clagstone, an active and
persistent aspirant. His campaign,
however, seems to arouse littlo en-,
thusiasm. Hon. Barney F. O'Neil
va also strongly mentioned in many 1
A 1A1 ,
parts oi the state, although we have
f
heard of no announcement from
hitn. Of course Governor Brady will
seek a renomination. From present
indications the Republicans of Idaho
will have a distinguished company to
select from. Tho five men aro all
capable, popular and Tvell known.
Any one of them would doubtless
make a first rato chief executive.
Tho one thing that stands out prom
inently is that noi th Idaho will have
candidate. The people up there will
probably canvass the situation and
al.v to the support of the most
likely man. If this happens Governor
Brady will probably have as his op
ponent i i the primary campaign I
either Hon. Burton !,. French or Hon.
Barney F. 0'Neil. The Tribune do-:s j
not know whom of these men can de- j
velop the greater strength in north !
Idaho. Both are well known, highly
respected and neither is slow in poli- 1
tical affairs. Our judgment is that !
Mr. French will seek Col. Thomas R.
Hamer's scalp, thus leaving the field \
open to Mr. O'Neil. The fi^ht be
tween Chairman O'Neil and Governor
Brady will be a hot number from the
word go.
The most interesting and the most j
welcome magazine that corned to The Î
Tribune oflice is Goodwin's Weekly, i
published at Salt Lake City, and ed- 1
ited by Judge C. C. Goodwin and man- j
aged by J. T. Goodwin, his son. There 1
is no magazine in the west like Good- !
wins', and there is no writer in the !
west like Goodwin, lie is in a class
by himself, and he more than any
other; has his magazine" in a class by !
itself. Every department of Good- j
wins' is interesting. Even the soci- '
ety saunterings of Salt Lake City are I
written with a crispness and gusto 1
that makes them interesting to the
people who know and care nothing
about the actual happenings.
Tho Christman number of Good- ;
wins is out. It is a fmo specimen of
the "art preservative;" is well edited, 1
and the articles, editorial, descriptive
and historical.arc excellent.

JUST A SUGGESTION.
The Press rather hesitates to offer
even a suggestion as to a lino of ac
tion for tho so-called insurgents and
their followers, but tho temptation
can't bo resisted this time. Now, as
a matter of fact, insurgents are gen
erally of tho "too pure for politlcii"
class and aro also firm believers thut
God Almighty ordained the dear di
rect primary and that neighbors must
not dWcus* tho fitness and nvailuhlt
ity of candidate» in assembly or other
wise before they are pasted upon
single handed at the primary. The
one idea of the insurgents is to down!
Cannon. What's the matter with !
taking the election of speaker .out of
th« hands of congressmen *and settling
it by direct primary? And why not
go a etep further and "hand one" to
Aldrich, leader of the senate, in the
Kuino way.—Wallace Press. j
