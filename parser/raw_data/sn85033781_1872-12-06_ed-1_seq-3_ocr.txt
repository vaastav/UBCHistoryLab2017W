PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE
To the frmate ami I!:ue of lieprrnentatice :
In transmit tin.; to yo-i my fourth airnul
menage, it U with thaiiUfiilnet tr t tio (liver
of all (;ooil, tint aa a nation we liava Loju
1Iiho1 for tho lant yo:ir with poioo at home
arul abroa.l, ami general vroipe rity vouch
ate J to but few people. With t lie exception
of the reocut ilevitHtatini; fires which nwept
from eanh wit?i a breath, a it were, million
of accumulated wealth in the ci'y of ilwton,
there h:i been no oveihmlo wing calaruititM
within the year to record. It la gratifying
to note hoW like their fellow cit:zeiM of
tho city of Chicago, under nimilar circum
stance, a year earlier, tho citizousof Histou
are rallying mule r their ruictfortunon, and tho
prospect is that their energy and pereever
auce will overcome all ol'Hticle, and how
the game prosperity noon that they would
have have had had no disaster befallen them.
Otherwise, we have been froe from penti
lence, war, and tho calamities which often
overtake nations. And, as far as lmmau judg
ment can penetrate tho future, no cause
eems to exist to threaten our present poace.
When Congress adjourned in Juno last, a
question had been raised by Great Uritain,
and was then pemlin, which for a timo we
ricusly imperilled the settlement by friendly
arbitration of the differences existing be
tween this Government and that of her
Ilritanuic Majesty, which, by tha Treaty of
Washington, had boen referred to the tri
bunal of arbitiation which had met at Geneva,
in Switzerland. The arbilrators, however,
disponed of the question which had jeopard
ized the whole of the treat, and threatened
to involve the two nations in most unhappy
relations toward each ether, in a manner en
tirely natisfactory to this Government ai.d in
accordance with" the views and tho policy
which it had maintained. Tho tribunal which
had convened in Geneva, in December, con
cluded its laborious session on the 11th day
of September last, on which day, having
availed itseif of the discretionary power given
to it by the treaty to award a sum in gross, it
made its decision whereby it awarded the
sum of .15.UOO,0UO in gold, as tho indemnity
to be paid, by Great Dritain to tbe United
'States for the satisfaction of all the claims
referred to its consideration. This decision,
happily, disposes of along standing difference
between two Governments, and in connection
with another award made by tho German Em
peror under a reference to him by the name
treaty, loaves tho two Governments without
a shadow upon the friendly relations which it
is my nincero hope may forever remain
remain equally unclouded.
Tho report of tho agent of tho United
'States, appointed to attend the Geneva t ri -.buual,
accompanied by tho protocols of the
proceedings of the arbitrators, tho arguments
of the counsel of both Governments, tho
award of the tribunal, and tho opinions given
bv the several arbitrators, is tian&initted here
with. I have caused to be traiiMnitted to the
heads of the time friendly powers who com
plied with the joint xefjuest made to them
under the treaty the thanks of this Govern
ment for the appointment of arbitrators made
by them respectively, and also my thanks to
the eminent personages named by the.u, and
my appreciation of the dignity, patience, im
partiality, and great ability w'ith which they
discharged their arduous and high functions.'
Her Majesty's Government has communi--cated
lo ino the appreciation by her Majesty
of the ability and indefatigable' industry dis
played by Mr. Adams, the arbitrator named
on the part of this Government, duiing the
protracted impiiris and discus.-ions of tho
tribunal. I cunlially unite with her Majesty
.in this appreciation
It is duo to the agent of the United States
belore tho tribunal, to record my appreciation
cf the marked utility, unwearied p. hence,
and the prudence and disiretian with which
he has conducted the very responsible and
delicate duties connuitte 1 to him. And
it is also due to the learned and eminent
counsel who attended the tribunal on the part
of this Government, to express my sense of
th-s talent and wisdom which they brought to
ear in the argument of the lesult so happily
reached. It will be the province of Congress
to provi lo for the distribution, among those
who aro entitled to it, of their respective
shares of the money 10 be paid.
Although the bum awarded is not payable
uutil tho year from the date of the award, it
is deemed advisable that no time be lost in
making a proper examination of the several
cases in which indemnification may he due. I
consequently recommend the creation of a
Hoard of Commissioners for tho purpose. J3v
the thirty-fourth aniclc of the Treaty of
Washington the respective claims of tho
United States and of Great Uritain m their
construction of the treaty of the 15th June,
1340, defining the boundary hue between their
respective territories, were submitted to the
arbitration and award of his Majesty the Em
peror of Germany, to decide which" of these
-claims is most in accordance with tLe true in
terpretation of the treaty of 18hi. His Ma
jesty the Emperor of Germany having been
pleased to undertake the arbitration has tho
earnest thanks of this Government and of tho
United States for tho labor, pains and care
which ho has devoted to the consideration of
this long-ponding difference. I have caused
an expression of my thanks to be communi
cated to his Majesty. Mr. IJancroft. tho
representative of this Government at lierlin,
-conducted the case and prepared the state
ment on the part cf tho United States with
the ability that his past Herviee justified tho
public in expecting at his hands. As a mem
ber of Cabinet at the date of treaty which has
given rieo to the di-cussion between the Gov
ernments ; La the Minister to Great Eritain
when the construction now pronounced un
founded was llr-t advanced, and as the agent
and representative of tho Government to
present the case and receive the award, ho
lias been associated with the question in all of
ks phases, and in every stage has manifested
a patriotic zeal and earnestness in mainten
ance of tho claim of the United States. He
.is entitled to much credit for tho success
which has attended the submission. Altera
patient investigation of tho caso and of the
statements of each party, his Maje.-tv the
Emperor of Germany," on the 21st day of Octo
ber last, signed Ids award in writing, decree
ing that the clam of tho Government of the
United States that tho boundary lino between
the territories of her Eritannic Majcstv aud
tho United States should be drawn through
the Haro Channel, is most in accordance with
the true interpretation of the treaty concluded
on the 15th of June, 181C. between the agents
of her Eritannic Majesty and of tho United
.Sates. Copies of the case presented on be
half of each Government ai.d of the state
ment in reply to' each, and a translation of
tho award, iu transmitted herewith. This
award confirms ths United States in their
-claim to the important archipelago of islands
lying between the continent and Vancouver's
Viand, which for twenty-six years, ever since
tho ratification of the treaty, Groat Ilritain
lias contested, and leaves 'us, for the first
time in tho history of the United States as a
nation, without a question of disputed bound
ary between our territory aud the possessions
of Great Eritain r.n the continent.
It is my grateful duty to acknowledge the
prompt, spontaneous action of her Majesty's
Government in giving effect to tho award. In
anticipation of any request from tins Govern
ment, and before the reception in the Uuted
States of the award fignod by tho Emperor,
her Majesty had given instructions for the
removal of her troops, which had been sta
tioned there, and for the cessation of all ex
ercise or claim of jurisdiction, so as to leave
the United States in exclusive possession of
the lately disputed territory. I am rrratcf ul
to no anie 10 announce mat tno orders ior
the removal of tho troops hav been exe
cuted, and the military Joint occupation of
vSan Juan lias ceased. Tho islands are now in
tho exclusive possession of the United Stales.
It now becomes neeensaty to complete the
survey and determination of that portion of
the nouimary nno tnrougn tne liaro channel.
npon which the Commission which deter
mined the remaining part of tho line were mi
ble to agree.
I recommend the appointment of a Com
mission to act jointly with one which may be
named by her Majesty for that purpose. Ex
rerience of the difficulties attending the de
termination of our admitted lino of boundary.
after the occupation of the territory and its
pettlement by thse owing allegiance to the
ro-trfivfl Governments, points to the im
portance of establishing, by natural objacts
or other monuments, the actual lino between
tho territory acquired by purchase from lius
sir, aud the adjoining poaseasious of hor
Eritannio Majesty. The region is now no
sparsely occupied that no contacting interests
of individuals, or of Jurisdiction, aie likely
to interfere to the delay or embarrassment of
the actual location of tho line. If deferred
until poi illation shall enter and occupy the
territory, some trivial contest of neighbors
may again array the two Governments in an
tagomsiu. I therefore recommend tho ap
pointment of a commission to act jointly w ith
ono that may be appointed on tho part of
Great Uritalii, to determine the lino between
our Territory of Alaska and tho co-terminous
possessions of Great Ihitain.
In my last annual message I rocommondod
the legislation necessary on tho part of tho
United States to bring into operation tho ar
aooner attendod to. To this end I recommoiid
that a sufficient appropriation bo wade.
With France, our earliest aliy ; ltussia, tho
constant and steady friend of tho Cup
led States; Germany, with whoso Govern
ment and peoplo wo have so many causes of
friendship, and so many common sympathies,
and the other powers of Europe, our relations
are maintained on tho most friendly terms.
Since my last annual message the exchauge
lias been made of the ratification of a treaty
with the Austro-Hungary Empire, relating to
naturalization; also of a treaty with tho Gor
man Empire, respecting Cousuls and trade
marks : also of a treaty with Sweden and Nor
way, relating to naturalization , all of which
treaties luvo been duly proclaimed.
Congress, at Us last session, having mado
an appropriation to defray tho expenses of
Commissioners on the part of tho United
States to the International and Statistical Con
gress at St. Petersburg, the persons appoint
ed in that character proceeded to their desti
nation and attended the sessions of the Con
gress. Kepotts shall in due season be laid be
foro vou. This Congress meets at intervals
of about three years, aud has held its sessions
in several of the countries of Europe. I sub
mit to your consideration tho propriety of ex
tending an invitation to tno uongrcss to noiu
its next meeting in tho United States, lne
centennial celebration, to bo held in 1M7C,
would afford an appropriate occasion for such
a meeting.
Preparations are making for the Interna
tional Exposition, to bo held during the next
year in Vienna, on a scale of very great mag
nitude. I ho tendency or tneso expositions is
in the direction of advanced civilization and
tho elevation of industry, of labor, and the in
crease of human happiness, as well as of
greater intercouise and good-will between na
tions. As this exposition is to bo the first
which will have been held in Eastern Europe,
it is believed that American inventors and
manufacturers will bo ready to avail them
selves of the opportunity for the presenta
tion of their production's, if encouraged by
proper aid and protection. At the last session
of Congress authority was given for the ap
pointment of one or more agents to represent
this Government at tho Exposition. The au
thority thus given has been exercised, but in
the abscnco of any appropriation thero is
danger that the important benefits which the
Exposition offers will, m a large degree, be
lost to citizens of the United States. I com
mend tho subject strongly to your considera
tion, and recommend that an adequate appro
priation bo mado for the purpose. To fur
ther aid the American exhibitors at the Vienna
Exposition, I would recommend, in addition
to an appropriation of money, that the Secre
tary of tho Navy bo authorized to lit up two
naxal vessels to transport between our Atlan
tantic cities and 'liieste, or the most con
venient port to Vienna, and back, their articles
for exhibition.
Since your last session, the President of tho
Mexican Kepubhc, distinguished bv his high
character at d by his services to his country,
has died. His temporary successor has now
been elected with great unanmity by thy peo
pcle a proof of contidence on their part in
his patriotism aud wisdom, which, it is be
lieved, will bo confirmed by tho results of his
administration.
It is particularly desirable that nothing
should be left undone, by tho Government of
either Eepuhlic to strengthen their relatiions
as neighbors and friends. It is much to be
regretted that many lawloss acts continue to
disturb the quiet of tho settlements on tho
border between our territory and that of
Mexico, and that complaints of wrong to
American citizens m various pTtsof thocoun
trp are made. The rcvoiutionarycondition in
which the neighboring Eepubhc has o long
been involved has, in somo degree, contribu
ted to this disturbance. It is to bo hoped
that with a more settled rule of order through
out tho Republic, which liuy bo expected from
the proseut Government, "tho acis of which
just complaint is made will cease.
Tho proceedings of tho Commission under
tho convention with Mexico of the 4th of July,
lstJS, on tho subject of claims, havo unfortu
nately been checked by an obstacle, for tho
removal of which measures havo been taken
by tho two Governments which, it is believed,
will prove successful. Tho Commissioners ap
pointed pursuant to the joint resolution of
Congress of tho 7th of May last, to inquiro
into depredations on tno Texas frontier, have
diligently made investigations in that quar
ter." Their report upon the subject will be
communicated to you. Their researches were
roccssarily incomplete, partly on account of
the limited appropriation made by Congress.
Mexico, on tho part of that Government, has
appointed a similar Commission to investigate
these outrages. It is not announced officially,
but the press of that country states that tho
fullest investigation is desired, and that tho
co-operation of all partios concerned is invited
to secure that end. I therefore recommend
that a special appropriation bo mado, at the
earliest day practicable, to enablo the Com
missioners' on the part of tho United States to
return to their labors without dely.
It is with regret that I have again to an
nounce a continuance of the disturbed condi
tion of tho Island of Cuba. No advance to
ward tho pacification of the discontented por
tion of tho population has been made, whilo
the insurrection has gained no advantages,
aad exhibits no more of the elements of power
or of tho prospect of ultimate success than
were exhibited a year ago. Spam, on ttio
other hand, has not succeeded in repression,
and the parties stand apparently in the same
relative attitude which they have occupied for
a long time past. This contest has lasted now
for more than four vears. ero it seen at a
distance from our neighborhood we might bo
indifferent to its result, although humanity
could not be unmoved by many of its inci
dents whenever they might occur. It is, how
over, at our door. I cannot doubt that the
continued maintenance of slavery in Cuba is
among the strongest inducements to the con
tinuance of this strife. A terrible wrong is the
natural cause of a terrible evil. The abolition
of slavery and the introduction of other re
forms in tho administration ox tho tiovem
ment in Cuba could not fail to advance the
restoration of peace and order. It is espe
cially to bo hoped that the present liberal
Government of Spam will voluntarily adopt
this view. Tho law of emancipation, which
was pasted more than two years since, has re
mained unexecuted in tho 'absence of regula
tions for its enforcement. It was but a feeblo
step toward emancipation, but it was the
recognition of right, and was hailed as such,
and exhibited Spam in harmony with tho senti
ments of humanity and ox justico, ana in sym
pathy with the other powers of the Christian
and civilized world. Within tho past few weeks
the regulations for carrying out the laws of
emancipation have be'cu announced, giving
evidence of tho tduccritv of the intention of
the Present Government to carry into effect
tho law of 1870. I havo not faded to urge
the consideration of the wisdom, the policy,
ami the justice of a more effective system for
the abolition of tho great evil which has oj
ptesed a race and continues a bloody and de
structive contest close to our border, as well
as the expediency and the justice of conced
ticles of the Trcatv of Washington, of My,
1M71, relating to tlie fisheries, and to other
matters touching the relations of the United
Hiatos toward the Dritish North American pos
sessions, to beeoino operative as oon as the
proper legislation should be had on the part
of Great Eritain and the possessions. That
legislation on the part of Great Eritain and
its possesions had not then been had, and
during the session of Congress a question was
raise v', which for the time laised a doubt
whether any action by Congress in tho direc
tion indicated would become important a
question which has since been disponed of.
au 1 I have received notice that the Imperial
Pailiament and the Legislature of tho Pro
viucial Government have passed laws to carry
tho provisions of the treaty on tho matters
referred to into onerition. I therefore
leeoumiend your early adoption of tho legis
lation in tho same dircetiou necessary on tho
part of this Government.
The Joint Commission for determining the
boundary line between tho United States and
the Eiitish possessions, between tho Lake of
the Wowds and the ltocky mouutaius, has or
ganized and entered upon its work. It is de
sirable that the foreo be increased, in order
that the completion of tho survey and tho de
termination or tho boundary mm may oe
ing reforms of which tho propriety is not
nuostioned. Deeply impressed with tho con
viction that tho continuance of slavery is one of
tho moist active causes of tho continuance of
the unhappy condition in Cuba, L regret to
believe that citizens of the United States, or
those claiming to be such, aro largo holders
in Cuba of what is there claimed as property,
but which I forbidden and denounced by the
laws of the United States. They aro thus, in
douaneo of the spirit of our laws, contributing
to the continuance of this distressing and
sickening contest. In my last annual message
I referred to this subject, and I again recom
mend such legislation as may bo proper to de
nounce, and, if nt prevent, at least to dis
courago American citizens from holding or
dealing in slaves.
It is gratifying to announce that tho rati
fication of the convention coucluded under tho
auspices of this Government, betwoen Spain
on the ono hand and tho Allied Republics of
tho Pacific on tho other, providing for an
armistice, havo been exchanged. A copy of
tho instrument is herewith submitted. It is
hoped that this may be followed by a perma
nent peaco betweon tho same parties.
Tho differences which at one time threat
ened tho maintenance of peace between
Erazil and the Argentine Kepubhc, it is
hoped, are in tho way of satisfactory adjust
ment with these States, as with the Republics
of Central and Southern America we continue
to maintain the most friendly relations. It is
with regret, however, I announco that the
Governor of Venezuela has mado no further
payments on account of the awards under the
Convention of the 25th of April, 1855. That
Eepuhlic is understood to bo now almost, if
not quite, tranquilized. It is hoped, there
fore, that it will lose no time in providing for
the unpaid balances of its debt to the United
States, which having originated in injuries to
its citizens by tho Venezuelan authonties. and
having been acknowledged pursuant to a
treaty in the most solemn form known among
nations, would seem to deserve a preference
over debts of a different origin and contracted
in a different manner. This subject is ear
nestly recommended to tho attention of Con
gress for such action as may bo deemed
proper.
Our treaty relations with Japan remain un
changed. An imposing embassy from that
interesting and progressive nation visited this
country during the year that is passing, but
being "unprovided with power for tho signing
of a convention in this country, no conclusion
in that direction was reached. It is hoped,
however, that the interchange of opinions
which took place during their stay m this
country had led to a mutual appreciation of
the interests which may be promoted when
tho revision of tho existing featy shall bo
undertaken.
In this connection I renew my recommenda
tion of ono year ago. that to give importance
and to add to the efficiency of our diplomatic
relations with Japan and China, and to further
aid in maintaining the good opinion of these
peojdc, and secure to tho United States its
share of tho commerce destined to How be
tween these nations and the bilanco of tho
commercial world, an appropriation be roide
to support at least four American youths in
each of theso count rios, to servo as a part of
tho official family of our .Ministry there. Our
representatives would not even then be placed
upon an equality with tho representatives of
Great Eritain or some other powers. As now
situutcd, our representatives in Japan and
China have to depend for interpreters and
translators upon natives of those countries
who know our languago imperfectly, or pro
cure for tho occasion tho services of employes
in foreign business houses, or tho interpreters
to other foreign Ministers,
I renew tLe recommendation mado on a
previous occasion of ttio transfer to tho De
partment of the Interior, to which they seem
nioro appropriately to belong, of all the
powers and duties in relation to the terri
tories with which the Department of State is
now charged by law or by custom.
Congress, from the beginning of the Gov
ernment, has wisely made provision for the
relief of distressed seamen in foreign coun
tries. No similar provision, however, has
hitherto been made for tho relief of citizens
in distress abroad other than seamen. It is
understood to bo customary with other Gov
ernments to authorize Consuls to extend such
relief to their citizens or subjects in certain
cases. A similar authority and an appropria
tion to carry it into effict aro commended in
cases of citizens of tho United States sick,
under such circumstances. It is well known
that such citizens report to foreign countries
in great numbers ; though motd of them are
able to bear the expenses incidental to loco
motion, thero aro somo who, through accident
or otherwise, become penniless, and have no
friends at homo able to succor them. Per
sons in this situation must either perish, cast
themselves upon the charity of foreigners, or
bo relieved at the private charge of our
officers, who, usually, even with tho most
benevolent disposition, have nothing to spare
for such purposes. Should tho authority and
the appropriation asked for bo given, care
will bo taken to cairy the benefieenea of Con
gress into effect, that it shall not be mi
necessarily or unworthily bestowed.
llio net reduction of tho principal of tho

This statement treats solely of the principal
or the public debt, uy tho monthly state
ment of the public debt, which adds together
tho principal and interest due and unpaid and
the interest accrued to date duo, and doducts
the cash in the Treasury, accordingly on the
day of publication tho reduction was 100,-

tion of taxation by tho acts of Congress at its
last session, tho expenditure of tho Govern
ment iu collecting the revenuo will be much
reduced for the next fiscal vear. It is very
doubtful, however, whether any further re
duction of so vexatious a burden on any peo
ple will bo practicable for tho present. At all
events, as a measure of justice to the holders
of tho nation's certificates of indebtedness. 1
would recommend that no more legislation bo
had on the subject unless it be to correct er
rors of omission or commission in the present
laws, until sufficient time has elapsed to
prove that it can bo done and still have suffi
cient revenue to meet the current expenses of
tho Government. rav interest on the public
debt, and Provide for the sinking fund estab
lished bylaw. The preservation of our na
tional crouit is or the highest importance.
Next in importance to this comes a solemn
duty to provide a national currency, of fixed.
unvarying value as compared with cold : and
as soon as practicable, having due regard for
tho interests of the debtor class and the
vicissitudes of trade and commerce, and con
vcrtiblo into gold at par.
The report of the Secretary of War shows
the expenditures of the War Department for
the fiscal year ending June 30, 1871, to be
135,799,991.82; and for tho fiacal var ending
June 39, 1S72, to be $35,372,157.23, fchowing
a reduction iu favor of tho lait fiscal vear of
127,83 1.02.
Tho attention of Congress will bo called
during its present pesBion to Variou.i enter
prises for the more certain und cheaper trans
portation of tho constantly increasing mrphis
of tlis Western and Southern product to tho
Atlantic seaboard. Tho subject H one that
will force itself upon tho legislativo branch
cf tho Government sooikeror later, and I sug
gest, therefore, that immediate steps he taken
to gain all availablo infoimation to itjmuo
equitable and just legislation. Tho rout o to
connect tho Mississippi Valley with tho Atlan
tic, at Charleston, S. C, and Savannah, Ga.,
by water, by tho way of the Ohio and Tennes
see rivers, and cauaU, and slack wa.'cr naviga
tion to tho Savannah and. Oeinukce rivers,
has been surveyod and report mado by an no
complishod engineer of the army. Stcond
und third new routoa will bo proposed Tor tho
consideration of Congress, namely, by an ex
tension of tho Kanawha and James river canal
to the Ohio, and by extension of tho Chesa
peake and Ohio canal. I am not prepared to
recommend Government aid to these or other
enterprises, until it is clearly shown that they
aro not only of national intorest, but that
when completed they will bo of a value com
mensurate with their cost. That production
increases moro rapidly than the means of
transportation in our country, has been de
monstrated by past experience. That the un
precedented growth in population and pro
ducts of tho whole country will require ad
ditional facilities and cheaper means for the
moro bulky articles of comnierco to reach tho
tide water'and a market will be demandod in
the near future is equally demonstrable. I
would therefore suggest either a committee
or commisioncr bo authorizod to consider this
whole question, and to report to Congress at
somo future day for its better guManco in
legislating on tho important subject. The
railroads of tho country havo been rapidly ex
tended during the last few years to meet tho
growing demands of producer-, and reflect
much credit upon the capitalists and mana
gers engaged in their construction. In addition
to these, a project to facihtato commerce by
tho building of a ship canal around Niagara
Falls on the United States side, which
has been agitated for many years, will no
doubt bo called to your attention this session.
Looking to tho great future of the country and
tho increasing demands of commerce, it might
bo well, while on 'this subject, not only to
have examined and reported upon, tho various
practicable routes for connecting tho Missis
sippi with tide water, but the feasibility of an
almost continuous land locked navigation from
Maine to the Gulf of Mexico. Such a route
along our coast would bo of great value at all
times, aud of inestimable value in case of a
foreign war. Naturo has provided the greater
part of this route, and tho obstacles to bo
overcome aro easily within tho sum or tno
engineer. I havo not alluded to this subject
with the view of having any further expendi
ture of public money, at this tnno, than may
bo necessary to f rocure aud place all the
necessary information before Congress m an
authentic form to enable it hereafter, if deem
ed practicable and worthy, to legislate on tho
subject without delay.
It is evident unless steps aro taken to
preservo our navv, that in a very few years
tho United States will bo tho weakest nation
upon the ocean of all tho great powers. With
an energetic, progressive, business people
like ours, penetrating and forming business
relations with every part of tho 1-nown world,
navv strong enough to command tho re
spect of rur Hag abroad is necessary for tho
full protection of their lights. I recommend
careful consideration bv Congress of the
recommendations iiU0 by the Secretary of
tho Navy.
Tho accompanying report of tho Post
master General furnishes a full and satisfac
tory exhibit of tho operations of the Post
ofiice Department dining the vear. Our
postal communication Aviih all parts of the
civilized world havo been placed upon a most
advantageous footing by the improved povtal
conventions and arrangements recently con
cluded with tho leading commercial countries
of Europe and America, and tho gratifying
statement is made that, with the conclusion
oi a satisfactory convention with France, tho
details of which have been definitely agreed
to by the head of tho French Postal Depart
ment, subject to tho approval of the Minister
of Finance, little remains to bo accomplished
by treaty for somo timo to come, in respect
to reduction of rate, or improved facilities for
postal intercourse.
I have heretofore commended tho abolition
of tho franking privilege, and see no reason
now for changing my vusws on that subject.
It not having been favorably regarded by
Congress, however, I now suggest a modi
fication of that privilege to correct its glaring
and costly abuses.
I would recommend also tho appointment
of a committee or commission to take into
consideration ttio best method, equitable to
private corporations who have invested their
time and capital in tho establishment of
telegraph lines, of acquiring tho title
to all the telegraph lines now in operation,
and of connecting this service with the
postal service of the nation. It is not
probable that this subject could receivo tho
proper consideration during tno limits ot a
short session of Congress, but it may bo
initiated, so that further action may be fair
to tho Government and to pnvato parties
concerned.
The report of tho Secretary of tho Treasury
will show an alarming falling off in our carry
ing trade, for th last ten or twelve years,
and even for tho past year. 1 do not believo
that public treasure can bo better expended
in tho interest of the whole people than in
trying to iecver this trado. An expenditure
of five million dollars per annum for tho next
live years, if it would restore to us our pro
portion of tho curving trade or the woild.
would be profitably expended. Tho price of
labor in Enropo has so much enhanced within
the last few years, that tho cost of building
and operating ocean steamers in the
United States is not so much greater than
iu Europe, that I believo the time has arrived
for Congress to take this subject into serious
consideration.
Detailed statements of tho disbursements
through tho Department of Justice will be
furnished by the Attorney Geueral, and
though these havo been somewhat met cased
bv the recent acts of Congress to enforce the
lights of citizens of tho United States to vote
in tho several States of tho Union, and to
force the provisions of the Fourteenth Amend
ment to tho Constitution of tho United States
and the amendment thereto, I cannot ques
tion tho necessity and salutary effect ot these
enactments. Reckless and lawless men, 1
regret to say, kavo associated themselves
together in some localities to deprive ct 'pt
citizens of the right guranteed them by the
Constitution of the United States, and to that
end they have committed deeds of violence,
but tho prevention and punishment or many
of these persons have tended greatly to tho
repression of such disordets. I do not doubt
that a grat majority of the people of all
Carts of tho country favor the full enjoyment
y all classes of persons of thoso rights
to which they are entitled under the
Constitution and the laws, and to in
voke aid and influences of all good citizens
to prevent organizations whoso objects auo by
unlawful means to interfere with those lights.
I look with contidence to the time not far dis
tant when tho obvious advantagos of good or
der and peaco will induce an abandonment of
all combinations pnfhibited by tho acts refer
red to, and when it will be unnecessary to
carry on tho prosecutions, or inflict punish
ment to protect citizens from tho lawless do
ings of such combination. Applications have
been made to me to pardon persons convicted
of a violation of said acts npou tho ground
that clemency in such cases would tend to
tranquillize tho public mind, and to test the
virtue of that policy I am disposed, so far as
my sense of Justice will permit, to give to
theso applications a favorable consideration,
but any action thereon is not to be construed
as indicating any chango in my determination
to enforce with vigor such act so long as the
conspiracies and combinations therein named
disturb the peace of tho country. It is much
to le regretted, aud is regretted by no ono
moro than m3self, that a necessity has ever
existed to execute the inforcement act. No
ono can desire more than I that tho necessity
nf nnnivinir it mav never azain be demanded.
I The Secretary of tho Interior reports satis-
I factory Improvement ana progression in eacu
of the several bureaus under the control of
the Interior Department. They are all in ex
cellent condition, iiiewcru whtcii in somo
of them for some years Ins ben in arrears
hai been brought down to a recent date, and
to ad the current business has been promptly
mspaicuod.
Tho poiicy which was adopted at the begin
ning of the Administration with regard to tho
management of tho Indians ha been as suc
cessful as its most ardent friends antieipatod
within so shorf a time. It has reduced the
expense of their management, decreased their
forago upon tho white settlements, tended to
give tho largest opportunity to the extension
of tho great railways through tho public do
main and the pushing the setltements into tho
moro remote districts of tho country and at
tho samo time improve the condition of the
Indians.
'1 he policy will bo maintained without any
chango, excepting such as further experience
may show to be necessary to render it more
efficient. The subject of converting
tho so-called Indian Territory, south of Kan
sas, into a home for the Indians, and erecting
thereon a Territorial form of government, is
ouo of great importance as a complement of
the existing Indian policy. The question of
removal to tho Territory has within tho past
year been presented to many of the tribes
resident upon other and less favorable por
tions of the public domain, and has generally
been received by them as a preliminaav step
to tho organization of H.ieb u territory will be
necessary to confine the Indians now'resident
therein to farms of proper sizo, which should
be secured to them in fco.tho residue to b used
for tho settlement of other friendly Indians.
Efforts will bo mado in tho immediate future
to induce the removal of as many peaceably
disposod Indians only to tho Indian Territory
as can be wettlod properly without disturbing
the harmony of those already thero. There
is no other location now availablo where a peo
ple who aro endeavoring to acquire a knowl
edge of pastoral and agricultural pursuits can
be as well accommodated as upon tho unoccu
pied lands of the Indian Territory.
Affairs in the Territories are generally satis
factory, rho energy and business capacity of
the pioneers who aro settling up the vast do
main not yet incorporated into States, aro
keening pace in internal improvements and
civil government with tho older communities.
In but ono of them, Utah, is the condition of
affairs unsatisfactory, except so far as the
quiet of the citizens may be disturbed by the
real or imaginary danger of Indian hostilities.
It has seemed to be the policy of the Legis
lature of Utah to evade all responsibility to tho
Government of tho United States, and even
to hold a position in hostility to it. I recom
mend a careful revision of the laws of the
Territory by Congress, and the enactment of
such a law as the one proposed in Congress
at its last session, for instance or something
similar to it, as will secure peace, tho equality
of all citizens before tho law, aud the ulti
mate relinquihhment of polygamy.
The ninth census is about completed. Its
completion is a subject of congratulation, in
asmuch as the use to bo made of the statistics
therein contained depends very greatly on
the prompitudo of publication. The Secretary
of the Interior recommends that a census be
taken in 1875, which lecommondation should
receive tho ready attention of Congress. The
interval at present established between tho
Federal census is so long that the informa
tion obtained at t'ie decimal periods to tho
material condition, wants and resources of the
nation is of httlo practical value. After tho
expiration of the fust half of that period, it
would probably obviate the constitutional pro
vision regarding the decimal census, if a cen
sus taken in lt75 thould be divested of all
political character, and no apportionment of
Congressional represenation bo made under
it. Such a census cmiing as it would in tho
last year of tho fiist century of our natioual
existence would furnish a noble monument of
the progress of the United States during that
century.
The rapidly increasing interest in education
is a most encouraging feature in tho current
history of tho country, audit is no do.tbt truo
that this is duo in a great measure to the
efforts of the P.ureau of Education. That
office is continually receiving evidences which
abundantly prove ,its efficiency, from .the
various institutions ofarmug and educators
of all kinds throughout the country. Tho
report of tho Commissioner contains a vast
amount of educational details of great inter
est. The bill now pending before Congress,
providing for the appropriation of part of tho
proceeds of tho sales of public lands for edu
cational purposes to aid tho States in tho
general education of their rising generation,
is a measure of such great importance to our
teal progress, and is so unanimously approved
by tho leading friends of education, that com
mend it to the favorable attention of Congress.
Tho report of tho Commissioner of Agri
culture gives a very full aud interesting ac
count of tho several divisions of that depart
ment tho horticultural, agricultural, sta
tistical, entomological, and chemica' and tho
benefits conferred by each upon the agricul
tural interests of the country. The wholo
report is a complete historv in total of the
working of that department in all its branches,
shewing the manner in which tho farmer,
merchant and miner is informed, and tho
extent to which ho is aided iu his pursuits.
Iho commissioner makes one recommenda
tion, that measures bo taken by Congress to
protect and reduce the planting of forests,
and suggests that no part of the public lands
should bo disposed of without the condition
that one-tenth of it should be reserved in
timber where it exists, and where it does
not exist inducement bliould bo offered by
planting it.
Iq accordance with tho terms of the act of
Congress approved March 3, 1S7I, providing
for the celebration of the one hundredth an
niversary of American independence, a Com
mission has been organized, consisting of the
two members from each of the States and
Territories. The Commission has held two
cessions, and has made satisfactory pro
gress in the organization and in the
initiatory eteps nceessury for the car
rying out the provisions of the p.ct, and for
exceeding the provisions also of the act of
June 1, ls71, creating a continual Hoard oi
Fiuai.ce. A preliminary report of progress
has been received from tho President
of the Commission, and is herewith trans
mitted. It will be tho duty of the Commission at
your coming session to transmit a report of
the progress made, and to lay before you the
details relating to the exhibition of Ameri
can and foreign arts, product9, and manu
factures which, by the terms of the act, is to
be held under the auspices of the Govern
ment of the United States, in the city of
Philadelphia, in the year 1876. This cele
bration will be looked forward to by Ameri
can citizens with great interest, as making
a century of greater progrets and prosperity
than is recorded in the history cf any other
nation, and proving a further good purnofc
iu bringing together on our soil the people
of all the commercial nations of the earth,
in a manner calculated to secure Interna
tional good feeling.
An earnest desire has boen felt to correct
abusf s which have grown up in the civil
service of the country, through the defective
method of making appointments to office,
which have been regarded to much as the
reward of political services. Under the au
thority of Congress rules have been estab
lished to regulate the terms of office and the
mrde of appointment. It cannot bo expected
that any system ot ruio can be entirely cf
t'eotive snd prove a perfect remedy for the
existing evils till they have been thoroughly
tested by actual practice and amended ac
cording to the requirements of the service
During my term of office it shall be my best
endeavor to ao apply the rules as to secure
the greatest possible reform in the civil ser
vice of the Government. But it will require
the direc: action oi congress to render the en
lorcemeni oi me system binding upon my
successors, and I hopo that the experience
of the past year, together with appropriate
"eeielation by Congress, may reach a satisfac
tory folut'on of this question, and secure to
the public service lor all time a practical
method of obtaining faithful and efficient
officers and employes.

The renort of tho Commissioner of
Internal Revenue states that the aggre
gate receipts from all sources, exclusive
of the duty on the capital, circulation
and deposits of National Banks were for
the following fiscal years ending June 30 :
"- fli2tt.W.7

These amounts include sums refunded
and allowed on drawbacks. The de
crease in the aggregate receipts for the
last two years is due to the legislation
approved July 14, 1S70, which reduced
the revrnue to the estimated amount of
$55,000,000 per annum, but which did
not go into full operation before the
close of the fiscal year 1871; Tho re
ceipts from epirits show an increase
over the last year of $3,992,010. The
sources are given as follows : .Spirits
dhtilled from apples, peaches or grapes,
$544,848; epirits distilled from materirla
other than apples, peaches or grapes,
$32,572,940; distillers' per diem tax,
$2,010,9SG; distillers' special and barrel
tax, $0,489,785; wine made in imitation
of champagne, $20; rectifiers, $955,704;
dealers in retail liquors, $4,028.004 : deal
ers, wholesale liquor, $2,005,503 ; manu-
lucturersof stills, $1,391 ; stills or worms
manufactured, 420 ; stamps, distillery
warehouse, $290,204 ; stamps, rectifiers'.
$307,920 ; stamps, wholesale liquor deal
ers', 1.19,002 ; excess o gaugers' fees,
$1,118; total, $49,475,570.
Ihe number of grun distilleries regis
tered the last year wa3 511; fruit dis
tillers. 338; making a grand total of
3,049. The returns to this olllco for the
last fiscal year show a total production
in taxable gallons from materials other
than fruit, of 08,275,745; from fruit,
757,788; total yearly production, 09,
033,533. By the act of June 0, 1872, the act of
July 13, 18GG, so far as it relates to fer
mented liquors, was re-enacted with
fcome amendments made at the solicita
tion, of the principal brewers of the
United States, designed to allbrd brew
ers better facilities than heretofore for
the conduct of their business under the
Internal Uevenue laws. These conces
sions do not appear to havo been of a
character to endanger the public inter
ests, as tho following statement will
show : " The tax received on fermented
liquors, at $1 per barrel, during the
first quarter of the fiscal year ending
June 30, 1872, was $2,217,191, while the
receipts from the same source during
the first three months of the present
fiscal year amount to $2,GS4,241, an in
crease of $400,949. The average increase
of about a million dollars annually dur
ing the last three fi?cal years, as con
tested, with the stationary character of
the receipts during the four years next
preceding, is certainly gratifying, but
the increase during the first three
months of the present fiscal year, as
above stated, far exceeds that of any
corresponding period in any other year
since the organization of this office. The
tax received on fermented liquors at
$1 per barrel was for the years.

Tho total receipts from tobacco for
the fiscal year ending June 30, 1872,
were $33,730,170, showing an increase
over the previous year ot $lo,203. Ihe
Commissioner says that, so lar as he is
able to judge, the law providing for a
uniform rate of tax on all manufactured
tobacco, whether chewing or smoking,is
operating very satisfactorily. There is
now no reason why revenue officers
should examine into the modes of
manufacturing tobacco employed by
any one, or lor opening or examining
any package, to ascertain the character
of its contents. If the package is a
legal one, and has upon it a proper rev
enue stamp, denoting the payment of
the tax, with such additional marks,
and brands, and labels as the law pre
scribes, no officer is authorized to exam
ine it further. t
Owincr to the distributinc causes which
have atlected the trade for some months
past, it is now too early to predict with
entire certainty what will be the actual
result of the present uniform tax on the
amount of revenue to be collected. He
has reason to believe that, with the ad
ditional safeguards provided by the new
law against the sale of manufactured
tobacco in fraud of the revenue, and
with the taxes imposed upon the sale at
retail of raw or leaf tobacco for con
sumption without its being subjected to
any process of manufacture, collections
from tobacco, under the uniform rate of
twenty cents a pound (which is a reduc
tion of more than six cents a pound
from the average rate for the last two
fi?cal years), will reach nearly, if not
quite, the suras realized for either of
the same years : " In making this esti
mate I am relying upon making col
lections of from 8,000,000 to 19,000,000
of pounds more of manufactured to
bacco in consequence of the restrictions
which the act of June G, 1872, has
placed upon the eale for consumption of
raw or leaf tobacco.
A Wisters paper says that the lyceum
is now a system of strolling players ; to
which arrV'KasytChair" replies: If
Froude and Tyndall and Beecher snd
Phillips, and Anna Dickinion and Mrs.
Stowe, and Theodore Thomas' orchestra
and Kubinstein, nre the stock company,
the strolling players are likely to be of
some service to the country."
