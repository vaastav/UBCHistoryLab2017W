the work of reconstruction as it has pro

ple have aocepted their condition iu good

when he said it was necessary to treat the
Southern people as honorable, high-mind
ed people, who would abide by what tney
azreed to do. This being true, why should
they be dented their right of representation
to Congress? ..
The Question of the Hour.
i tic question is iivi. uu, " r
President Johkson for the Presidency in
J868r The question that now vitally af
fects the country, Is: "Are the Southern
States In the Union and entit'ed to their
representation in Congress V That' the
question, . President. Johnson concur with
the Democratic party in the affirmation
that those States are in the Union. The
Negroltes, the Blood-letters, the Conflsca
tlonist and the DisunlonUts, assume an
antagonism thereto. Can patriot hesitate
which side to espouse ?
The Veto Power.
J Even if thU Congres should refuse to
allow the Representative of the Southern
State to take their seats, the President can
shield the Southern State against barbaric
and unjust law by the exercise of the veto
power. Inasmuch as be conceived it his
duty to use the pardoning power by way
or conciliating the South, we may be allow;
d to hope that he will use the vfcto power
to the same end, when it shall become nec
essary for him to do so. . ' ',
The Veto Power. Why Is It?
... if there Js harmony between the Presi
dent and the Republican Senators and Rep
resehtatlves in Congress, why is It that Con
gress does not admit the Southern Repre
sentatives f.niAad if there is such harmony,
why did Hobic Gkeklbt feel it incum
bent on him to post off to Washington and
(here undertake the work of establishing

Will the President Stand by the
Doctrine of his Message?
'. "Will President Johnson Und by the,
'view be ha advanced in , bis .Message,,
'touching reorganlaation ?" U a question ws
have been aj(ked. . We don't know whether
he. SvUl; bnt, unquestionably, be should,
! anil it becomes the people ' who want a
speedy and permanent pacification of the
country to encourage him to do so. There
are circumstance's which hope may at least
temporarily u t uposv-Il la abso
lutely certain that the views of the Mes
sage In regard to reorganization do not
harmonise with the views of the Radicals.
Antipodes were never more widely apart.
Wherefore did the President avow the
views ha has avowed in the Message If it is
iiot hisi purpose to stand by themf ne
knew what the opinions of the leaders in
the party through whose machinery he
was lifted Into the Presidential chair were
before he wrote his Message, and he knew
that those Views were the reverse of the
views W has, avowed.' What had he to
gain by promulgating views In opposition
to their views, it be did not intend to stand
by themf Those leaders have heretofore
been the representative men In their partyt
and their party was but recently triumph
ant everywhere. The perpetuity of that
party can, doubtless, be assured by Hie ex?
elusion of the lately Insurgent States
from;, a participation In the, Federal
I Government. If ambition to secure
an election to the Presidency tnree year
hence Is supposed to have influence over
his mipd, the presumption 1 that he would
have consulted the leaders in the Republi
can party, and made hi action harmonize
with their views. Had he done this, he
would, have made an argument to justify
aa exclusion of the Southern States from,
any voice In the Federal Government
would, Tiave pronounced la lavor of gene
' ral confiscation anil wholesale hanging or
expatriation. The Republican press and
orators bad put themselves Into an attitude
; to sustain hini In tuch a policy. With the
utmost unanimity; they had pronounced
bis reorganization policy "an experiment,'!
and; they have, for months, declared that
'experiment" a total failure, asserting
that the Southern people had acted in bad
faith had abused the confidence of the
President that at heart they were intense
i nnd trreconcilablv disloyal. la the face
of all this he prosecuted his work of reor
iranlzstlon: -To conciliate the Southern
people, he used the pardoning power liber
ally, and to satisfy the people at the North
he asked the Southern people to adopt the
Constitutional Amendment abolishing
ulavprv. Instead of admlttlne his work
to have been an abortive experiment,
he assumes that it has worked admlr
ably. He don't abandon It to the
tender mercies of this Congress. ' He tells
fVinimm that when the Southern States
shall have adopted the Constitutional
amendment abolishing slavery, that Is all
they have any right to ask of them, and that
they cm then&ad no pretext for excluding
their Representatives; and in return for the
South doing this, he proposes to proclaim a
general amnesty. He claims to hold In his
hands the pardoning power, and he pro
poses to use it freely. He says, In direct
language, that the South must be concili
ated that some inducement n ustboheld
out to them to take their places In the
Union ; and while he would banish the
great cauo of contention between the
North and the South, he would consign to
everlasting oblivion, by a general and
weeping amnesty, that which ha been
looked upon a the treason of the South
This is the drift of hi Message.
It is not Jong since Mr. McClcrb, ot
Pennsylvania, told the country, alter hav
ing had an interview with the President,
that he (the President was determlnea to
bring the Southern Representative into
Congress. The President has argued those
States right up to the doors of both houses
of the National Legislature; and he is
standing by them there. Every dally press
la Washington bu taken np the champion
ship of the rlsrhts of those States to repre-
sentatlon. . He has put into the hsnas oi
Ubkbt J. Raymond, after another conspic
uous Republican member of Congress had
declined to accept the office, the case Of the
Tennessee Representatives for presentation
in Congress. Whether these circumstances
Justify the opinion that the President will
tand by the doctrines ernis Message, on
a most vital point, we leave , the' reader to
judge for himself. It is very clear, that if
the Southern Representatives were In Con
gress they could not prevent the present
dominant party there from doing theni In-
Jury by pernicious legislation, iney
would have to rely upon tne president, ;
who holds in his hands the veto power,' to1
protect therni from outrage and wrong; and
on htm now they can rely with a much
safety as If they were In Congress, undoabt-ftfy-

the headings of "Receipts" and "Eipendi

are debits, and those placed onderExpeudl

that InBtcad of receipts and expenditures

Hlnterschelt and Jacob Timing.
'-We now take a bird's-eye view of Wen
ger's Halt. On the north side is the Booth
of St.' Aloyslus (Young .Men's Society.
This booth Is filled with various splendid
articles, as a wine set, cakes, toys, curious
mechanical contrivances, &o. On a plat
form west of the booth, are a dressing

We will now pass to Zettlcr's Hall. Here
the eye is quite bewildered by the magnifi
