Associated Press Special Wire
NEW YORK, Dec. 7.—Gonzalo Quesa
da, charge d'affaires of the Cuban re
public at Washington, last night tele
graphed the following statements <he
Herald: "The Cuban legation in this
country will strive during the session of
congress, which begins tomorrow, to con
tinue and bring to a decisive end the
labors which it Initiated last year. A
concurrent resolution, substantially de
claring the belligerency of the Cuban
patriots and recommending that the
good offices of the United States should
be directed toward obtaining the inde
pendence of Cuba, was passed, and ,ln
three test votes —two in the house and one
in the senate—the unanimous sentiment
of the American people was expressed
in unmistakable terms.
"Since then the Cubans have become
stronger every day. Notwithstanding
200,000 men sent by Spain, the Cubans
occupy the interior and have captured
important towns and even seaports.
Thousands of arms and several pieces of
artillery have ben sent, enabling the
army of liberation to operate from Point
Maisl to Cape Antonio. We can claim
that Cuba is free today. We can assert
that Spain Is trying unsuccessfully to
reconquer Cuba. She Is attempting to
exterminate a people, not to subdue a
rebellion. Our civil government, supreme
in three-fourth of the island, our com
plete military organization, our human
ity to the vanquished foe, are proofs of
tho existence of a responsible deter
mined rising nationality where there
was yesterday an oppressed colony. This
nationality cannot be crushed by land
ing new European armies on a terri
tory over which the Monroe doctrine Is
perfectly applicable. With as much rea
son as whs nthe French troops were
made to withdraw from Mexico can the
United States urge the evacuation of
Cuba by Spain's armies or request that
Spain shall fight her battle with the
troops she has already on this side of
the ocean. Cuba is not struggling for
herself alone. She Is fighting for the
salvation of the continent. Should the
Cubans be defeated after a long and
barbarous warfare, Spain would have to
keep on the island an immense standing
army to prevent any future uprising.
This quarter of a million men—this large
navy—would be a menace to Spaln'spld
colonies. The Monroe doctrine did not
prevent Cuba from being Spain's center
of operations against Latin America.
The United States could not allow at Its
very doors suoh an external threat to her
republican Institutions. The recognition
of the Cuban Independence of the re
public and her belligerent rights is,
therefore, a political necessity for the
Becurity of the continent.
"The United States In justice and
Americanism has seen fit to settle the
boundary between a British colony and
a sister republic. With more justice and
in a matter entailing the highest of
American principles — liberty — the
United States has precedents and rea
sons for such action. The interests of
her oltizens are involved, the American
people Insist that it shall be done, the
facts warrant it, humanity clamors for
it.
"As to the Cubans, we shall continue
to affirm our independence with our
armies in the field; we shall send to our
brethren, without violating any laws,
and patiently overcoming unjustifiable
obstacles put in our way, the elements of
war; we shall present the truth to the
press and opinion of the country, an
opinion which cannot be bought by gold
nor influenced by power; we shall point
to thee onslderatlon of the republican dl
our devastated fields, our ruined indus
tries, our massacred non-combatants,
the hundreds of victims of African penal
colonies, the thousands of families des
titute, banished, dying of hunger and
cold; we shall appeal, not for mercy, but
for fair play.
"The Cuban legation, representing an
unconquerable, gallant and brave peo
ple, will do its best to contribute to the
rapid termination of the cruel war. will
work unceasingly to see the Independ
ence o fthe republic and Its belligerent
rights proclaimed by America, and will
enlist In its noble aim the sympathy of
every true and liberty-loving Ameri
can."
NEW YORK, Dec. 7.—A Havana
■peclal to the World says: There Is ab
solutely no foundation for the report
that the new trial accorder to the Com
petitor prisoners by the supreme court
at Madrid will be by a civil court. Th"
rehearing will be by ordinary naval
courtmartlal, which means that the evi
dence and declarations now being taken
before Naval Commissioner Saul, within
the walls of Cabanas castle, will be
considered in open court later on at th.;
arsenal or such other point her as tho
admirality may direct by high naval of
ficers, especially designated to pass
Judgment thereon.
Public notice was given a fortnight or
more ago through the gazette official
summoning witnesses for the defense
to appear before the naval commissioner
and file their depositions. One man,
George Ferrera, who presented, him
self, was at. once placed under arrest
and charges have since been brought
against him as an accomplice. This
has called forth a new protest from the
American consulate nere.
The most damaging evidence against
the Competitor men as yet obtained Is
from Teodoro Waza, himself a member
of the expedition, but who has declined
American protection. He declared he
THE HERALD
was a loyal Spanish subject, and turned
state's evidence, Admiral Navarro and
Captain-General Weyler bavins prom
ised mat he supply the crown with testi
mony to convict his late companions.
The World this morning prints tlie fol
lowing letter Irofli Ona Melton, one of
the Competitor prisoners, dated No
vember 25. The letter was smuggled
out of Cabanas prison.
The Competitor case was continued
yesterday, the24th. Dr. Ceuia, captain
Laborde and Jorge Ferran were taken
successively to the Cutrte de Landeras,
where they were required to make de
positions on certain portions of the cas
In the presence of Teodoro Waza, the
man who has refused tlie protection of
the United States, claiming to be a loyal
Spaniard.
"The depositions wer taken by Lieu
tenant Fernandez Lopez Saul of the
navy, judge instructor. If convenient
to you 1 will be much obliged to you if
you will make public this move in our
case to the American vice consul, Mr.
Springer, or some one in the consulate.
Antonio Lopez Colomax is to be shot
here In the morning. If so, you will per
haps know it by the time you gel this.
He was brought here yesterday from
Mono castle, with his arms bound and
under close guard. Prisoners are
brought here from Moro castle to be
shot. I have learned from Colonel
Ernesto Jerez Verona ,who is one of
my cell mates, that Coloma was the lirsl
reel leader to raise arms in Malanzis
province in the war He left Ibarra
with a small party of men on the 24th of
Febuary, 18110, and a few days later waa
captured. Martinez Campos would not
execute Coloina but now, after months
have passed, Weyler seems to have
concluded to correct Campos' mis
take."
A special to the Herald from Jackson
ville, Fia., says: Tour correspondent has
received a dispatch from Havana which
states that Antonio Maceo has crossed
the trocha with a large force. It is re
ported, according to this dispatch that
Captain General Weyler has been
wounded at tho front. News from the
scene of the engagement is suppressed
by the officials at the palace.
WORRYING WEYLER
CINCINNATI, Dec. —A special to the
Commercial-Tribune from Tampa, Fla.,
says: From a Cuban passing through
today from Havana for Key West, which
point he reached in a fishing vessel, it is
learned that the skirmishing around
Guanabacoa continued and the raids
continue of nightly occurrence.
A dispatch received here tonight from
Havana by one of the Cuban leaders
slates nothing further has been heard
from Weyler, and the palace officials
seem worried. Another band of fifty
Insurgents crossed the trocha near Ar
temisa. This has caused reinforcements
tn be added to many portions of the
trocha, so that for many miles the pick
ets guarding it are within fifty feet of
each other.
There is a rumor in Havana that Gom
ez has scored another victory, but it can
not be substantiated. Havana people
are unusually reticent and the govern
ment spies are so numerous that they
refused to speak even to their closest
friends.
COMMERCIAL EFFECTS
NEW YORK, Dec. 7.—Owing to the
Cuban war, the Spanish-American Light
and Power Company, whose office is In
this city ai.d plant in Havana and Man
tanzas, Cuba, finds Itself In bad straits.
It is a New York state corporation with
a capital stock of $4,00,000. Prior to the
breaking out of the war the company
was very prosperous and made as high
as $1,000,000 profits a year. The company
was obliged to default on the interest
due November Ist. The city of Havana
is said to owe $300,000 to the company,
which the latter finds it impossible to
collect. It is endeavoring to eeet an
agreement whereby the bondholders will
agree to accept a reduction of interest
from 4 to 3 per cent on a portion of the
bonds.
COMMENTS ON THE MESSAGE
NEW YORK, Deo 7.—The World will
publish the following Interviews tomor
mor on the views of prominent Cubans
on the president's message:
Pledel Plerot of the Junta—The mes
sage is an enigma and a puzzle. I should
have a far higher regard for Mr. Cleve
land had he simply announced that the
United States government was opposed
to the cause of Cuban liberty and sym
pathized with Spain's effort to crush the
revolution. The message will not make a
particle of difference, one way or the
other, so far as the revolution is con
cerned. If the soldiers of Gomez and
Maceo realize that the measure means
that the United States will not raise
a finger to stop Weyler's butcheries, they
will fight with terrible energy born of
despair. Cleveland's talk about autono
my only shows how little he really
knows of the real state of affairs. The
Idea of autonomy Is dead. Scarcely any
one In Cuba, even among the Spanish
themselves, consider It seriously. The
autonomist party went to pieces months
ago. For us now there are left only the
two alternatives—lndependence or ex
termination.
Dr. Henry O. Zayas—The president's
message Is decidedly unsatisfactory to
both sides. The Cubans have a right to
expect more, but the consolation re
mains that he treats Spain with the
scorn which she deserves for her weak
and cruel rule. Toward the end the pres
ident promises that at some future time
his attitude will be clearly defined. Let
us hope then that he will act In accord
ance with the expressed wish of the
American people.
Dr. Rafael Navarro of the Cuban san
itary corps—Cleveland does not say any
thing In his message; he does not mean
to say anything. It is words, words'and
only words. My hope is in congress.
STATE EXAMINERS.
The Coyote Claims Matter Will Be De
cided Some Time.
SACRAMENTO, Dec. 7.—At a meeting
of the state board of examiners this af
ternoon the sum of $11,250 was ordered
paid to the soldiers' home at Yountvllle.
The legislature had appropriated $45,000
for the home, but there has been consid
erable objection to paying the money.
J. M. Wood of San Francisco urged the
board of examiners to recommend the
legislature to pay him $11,000. which
sum, it is claimed, he lost in furnishing
money to Owens Brothers, contractors,
to buy supplies towards building the
San Francisco sea wall. Prices had gone
up with a boom and Owens Brothers lost
heavily.
Governor Budd said he was opposed to
paying the claim. The governor tolel
Wood that if he had a bill passed by the
legislature he would veto it. It would
be establishing a bad precedent.
Owing to the absence of the- attorneys
general, the matter of the coyote claims
was continued until next Mondiay.

Style, Etc.—Bryan Won't Talk.
Associated Press Special Wlra
WASHINGTON, Dec. 7.—Comments
in the senate on the message were gen
erally favorable to the tenor of the mes
sage on the Cuban question, though
there were some opposing views ex
pressed.
A large number of senator*, including
a majority of the members of the com
mittee on foreign relations, excused
themselves from expesslng opinions, on
the ground that they had not given it
careful reading.
Senator Chandler (Republican)—lts
treatment of Cuba is elaborate and
strong. While noe going so far as I
wished It, it does by Implication from the
last sentences very plainly say that It
Spain does not suppress the rebellion
very quickly the United States will be
sure to intervene to secure the independ
ence of the island. The most notable
feature of the message Is the omission
to mention the free coinage of silver or
the currency question except to make
the useless 1 recommendation that green
backs be retired or not reissued when
they come to the treasury. Brief allu
sions to the tariff reiterate the claim of
Mr. Cleveland that the amount of duty
always Increases the cost to that
amount, but his feeble treatment of the
tariff question, compared with the ve
hement assaults made upon that tariff
in previous messages is notable. The
tone and temper of the whole message is
excellent and the fervid patriotism and
impartial views shawn In it are doubt
less sincere.
Mr. Mitchell (ep„ Oregon)— The mes
sage seems to leave the Cuban situation
as he finds it, refraining from any rec
ommendation as to congressional action.
The president's quasi-endoisement of
the existing tariff act will scarcely be
acceptable to Republicans who believe
In the protective policy.
Mr. Pettigrew (Rep., S. D.) —It Is the
first time in our history an executive,
who is the representative of a defeated
party, ever glorified, as Mr. Cleveland
does in the first paragraph of this mes
sage, over the success at the polls of his
party's opponents.
Mr. Prttehard (Rep., N. C.)— The only
noteworthy part of the message was
that devoted to Cuhimnd on that ques
tion it reminds me of the old rhyme:
"He wired in and wired out
And left the public still in doubt
As to whether the hart that made the track
Was coming in or going out."
Mr. Pugh (Dem-., Ala.) —The message
is sound on Cuba, sound on the tariff and
especially sound on trusts and monopo
lies.
Mr. Brice, Democrat, Ohio—The pres
ident has handled the questions tn as
diplomatic a manner as possible.
Mr. Nelson, Republican, Minnesota-
It Is a fair statement as regards Cuba.
Senator Tillman, Democrat, South
Carolina—lt is commonploce. The best
thing about it is that it ts the last we
will have from that source—at least the
last annual message.
Mr. Morgan, Democrat, Alabama—ln
the president's recital of the facts and
his statement of the moral duties of the
United Slates toward the Cuban bellig
erents there is a response to the senti
ment of the people, and I believe of the
senate. In asserting that no other na
tion must interefere in the.jiiairs of
Cuba there is the most decisive and
practical declaration of the Monroe doc
trine that has yet been made. But
while the present government warns off
all other nations, the message calls the
great civil war an Insurrection, and on
this Ifalse declaration justifies active
aid to Spain In furnishing all kinds of
military munitions, while it refuses our
people the right to send anything, even
bread and medicine, to the Insurgents. I
regret that this national action is so
illogical and, unjust that it. must still
cost many lives and terrible suffering
to a people who ore admitted by the
message to be i.r war for the sake of lib
erty and not as a. means of gaining
power for personal ends.
IN THE HONSE.
Mr. Hitt of Illinois, chairman of the
committee on foreign aftairs, declined
WE GOT THERE, THANK YOU!
diplomatically to give any expression
upon the message.
Mr. Heatwole, Minnesota, Republican
member of the foreign affairs commit
tee —The president evidently has been
Impressed with the sentiment which has
been voiced by the people of the country
In regard to Cuba during the congres
sional recess. He seems disposed to
urge some action by the United States
at the proper time, but fails to lndi a>
cate when that time shall arrive.
Mr. Cannon Illinois, Republican,
chairman of the committee on, appropri»
atlons —The deficit since the beginning
of Mr. Cleveland's present administra
tion to December 1, 7596, is $178,464,000.
This has been paid from the proceeds
of the sale of bonds. This deficit was
was $2,000,000 tor the twelve months
ending June 30, 1896. The deficit is
more than $40,000,000, which shows that
the president's confidence tha the pres
ent tariff law, if allowed a fair op
portunity, will yet yield sufficient reve
nue is not well founded. In other words,
hte deficiency In revenues is increasing
and not diminishing, all of which dem
onstrates ths absolute necessity tor
revenue legislation that will bring in
creased revenue.
"I do not believe it is practical to fund
the United States treasury note*, al
though a provision giving the secretary
of the treasury authority temporarily to
hold these notes in the treasury, as they
are placed there In redemption! or re
ceived from taxes, would probably be
wise.
"The president says we have a surplus
of $128,000,000 which can be devoted to
current expenses. The proceeds are
borrowed money. The bare statemtnt
of that fact shows the necessity for In
creased revenue; and with revenue
equal to expenditures, any surplus in
the treasury can be used in payment of
the interest-bearing debt of the United
States.
"I do not know what the facts are
touching Cuba except as I gather them
from the message. From a hasty ready
ing of the message I do not see but that
wisdom dictates congress should wait
executive action and recommendations
: as to Cuba."
Mr. McMlllln, Tennessee, Democrat,
member of the ways and means com
mittee —I agree with the president in
seeing no Immediate necessity or ex
cuse for inorease of tariff duties. The
surplus on hand outside the gold re
serve, with strict economy, probably
will meet all deficiencies in revenue for
more than half Mr. McKinley's adminis
tration and probably for the four years.
In order to increase the taxes on the
necessaries of life to either squander or
permanently hoard this surplus is whol
ly Inexcusable.
MrM. Cousins, lowa, Republican,
member of the foreign affairs commit
tee—lt is evident the president occupies
the same position that he has formerly.
To be plain, he does not believe that the
United States has any right to interfere,
and, to be equally plain, he feds, in a
greater degree than he has formerly ex
pressed, the sympathy of the American
people for Cuba. He seems to think it
might be possible for a condition of af
fairs to exist in Cuba at some time, no
one knows when, that would justify in
terfering on higher grounds than those
Involved in the ordinary rights of na
tions. What can be added to the situa
tion already existing to mate it suffic
iently serious to justify the interference
which the president has in mind?
Mr. Taft, Ohio, Republican, member
of the committee on foreign affairs—The
president's treatment of the Cuban
question as a whole may be considered
as a formal notice to Spain that the pres
ent conditions cannot be prolonged In
definitely. Indeed, it may set. a. basis for
intervention even before he goes out of
office and it gives him an opportunity to
throw the question onto the shoulders
of the succeeding administration.
Probably he will pursue the latter
course.
Mr. Dolllver, Republican, mem
ber of ways and means committee—The
president's treatment of the Cuban
question is harly satisfactory either to
those who desire to see Cuban
ence recognized or the class who desire
the United States to keep clear of for
eign disputes. Mediation by the United
States would be in the direction of a set
tlement honorable to both parties, but
the president's hint of what is likely to
happen in case mediation be refused is
a little too mysterious for practical pur
poses.
Mr. Dalzell, Republican, member of
ways and means committee—The mes
sage gives us no additional light on
Cuba. Thep residtn assumed from his
information, which is, no doubt, reliable,
that the insurgents have no claim to
possess a government or a capital. If
this is true, they are not entitled to rec
ognition as belligerents, and it follows
that they could not bo recognized as
pOS easing independence. In his treat
ment of the tariff tho president Is a little
unfair in juggling with figures. He un
dertakes to compare the operations of
the Wilson bill one year with the same
bill another year, Instead of with another
bill. We think the Wilson bill Is now
of a higher character than it was when
he refused' to sign It. He seems to fear
' that tha country may hay» too much rev
enue and become extravagant, a fear In
which the people will not join him.
Mr. Walker, Massachusetts, chairman
of committee on banking and currency—
The best message President Cleveland
has ever written. What he says about
th weakness and viclousness of our finan
cial methods is stating it mildly, and
ought to prompt the commercial organi
zations and bankers of the country to
come to the assistance of the banking
and currency committee with a plan
carefully prepared that would remedy
the evils admitted to exist by every
thoughtful financier.
Mr. Lacey, lowa, Republican—Presi
dent Cleveland is evidently anxious to
pass the uCban question over to Major
McKinley. There is no real solution of
the question embraced in his message,
except that Spain had better sell Cuba
bfore the property Is all destroyed.
Mr. Livingston, Georgia, Democrat—
The president has made a full and un
questionable showing in his message of
the necessity for our interference in
Cuba now.
M'KINLEY'S INTEREST.
CANTON, Ohio. Dec. 7.—The reading
of President n»veland"s message was
scarcely finished when Presldeiit-ekct
McKinley was furnished with a copy of
It by the Associated Press.
Mr. McKinley was In the best of spirits
when he read aloud to his friends about
him the first two paragraphs uttered by-
Mr. Cleveland, referring to the recent
election.
Mr. MciKnley made no effort to con
ceal his pleasure at the pleasant refer
ences made to the result of the contest.
Prhaps th greatest Intrst shown was in
his reading of Mr. Cleveland's exposition
of the Cuban situation, which he fol
lowed closely and read in full. Mr. Cleve
lands' utterances on the statistics of
the treasury department, retirement of
greenbacks and national banks were all
read with the deepest Interest.
BRYAN WON'T TALK.
LINCOLN, Neb., Dec. 7.—A represen
tative of the Associated Press called on
William Jennings Bryan this afternoon
and showed him a copy of President
Cleveland's message. Mr. Biyan was
and a constant stream of callers, and
overwhelmed with pressure of work
after repeated efforts, was compelled to
i abandon- the attempt to read the mes
sage.
"Mr. Cleveland's message," said Mr.
Bryan, "Is too Important a document
either to be commented upon In piece
meal or briefly as a whole. 1 do not care
to express myself upon the message un
til I shall have had opportunity to care
fully read and digest it."
ENGLISH COMMENT.
The Tone and Spirit Are Worthy of AH
Praise.
LONDON. Dec. B.—All of the news
papers this morning have editorials on
President Cleveland's message. Most
of them regard the message as one of
rather minor Imoprtance, xcept so far
as It concerns the Cuban question, to
which phase the bulk of comment is de
voted.
The Daily News, the Liberal organ,
says of the Cuban portion of the mes
sags: President Cleveland's argument
is clear enough that no country possess
es the right to foster a perpetual source
of trouble, and that Spain must either
grant autonomy or sell. Spa;., however,
will probably refuse to do anything of
tho kind. Her proverbial pride will be
much hurt by America's interference.
She will be disposed to insist upon her
right to wallop her own negroes as long
as she pleases, and Europe, being very
sensitive just now on the subject nf the
Monroe doctrine, Spain will probably be
Infiuentially supported if she holds out
AYe hope she will not prevail, because
autonomy is best for Cuba and best for
Spain.
THE TIMES.
The editorial in the Times says: The
tone and spirit of the message are worthy
of all praise. It is a pity the modera
tion and balance of mind which Mr.
Cleveland has just displayed were not
more conspicuous last year, when he
startled the tow continents by a men
ace of war. If the Venezuelan question
had been handled as Mr. Cleveland now
handles the Cuban question, he might
havp averted the disruption of the De
mocracy and have kept Bryan and Bry
anism in their previous obscurity.
The present message gives the sound
est advice in the most unexceptional
languag. nor can the least complaint be
made of the character nf tho warning
addressed to Spain. It is not improbable
that Spain will take offense, but clearly
Air. Cleveland Is actuated by friendly,
feelings, and Spain Will do well to ac
quiesce, otherwise the way will be clear
for the influence represntd by Mr. Call's
rsolutkvn in the senate yesterday. If
Spain closes now with Mr. Cleveland's
overture?, it would he djffl<#.t for the
McKinley administration to steer a new
course.

tion of a general arbitration treaty. It
says: It is clear that the Cleveland ad
ministration means to conclude the great
reform before resigning oflice.
On the proposed Cuban settlement the
Chronicle says: W r e believe the time
has passed when the Cuban insurgents
will accept any solution placing Spanish
officials over them, even nominally.
There is no mistake, however, about the
warning President Cleveland addresses
to Spain, and Spanish statesmen should
be aware that the Democratic govern
ment is far more pacific and conserva
tive in Its foreign policy than the com
ing Republican government Is likely to
be. Spain has to face a humiliating di
lemma, but she could not fight the Unit
ed States for twenty-four hours. There
fore, she should sell Cuba quickly, but
he would be no friend of the United
States who would advise her to buy
Cuba.
THE STANDARD.
The Standard (Conservative! says it
thinks that Spain had better accept Mr.
Clevelands' friendly counsel, as Mr. Mc-
Kinley Is not likely to be less exacting
than Mr. Cleveland. "The Monroe doc
trine," says the Standard, "is making
great strides. It is a large, bold policy,
but free from danger. Fortunately, as
far as England is concerned, the pros
pects of the arbitration treaty makes
the risks of trouble small. Altogether,
it is a dignified and able message."

IT WAKED THEM
Three Oregon Men Blown Up With Dy-
namite Escape Harm
SEATTLE, Dec. 7.— A spec.al to the
Post-Intelllgencer from Praie, Skagit
county, says that on the night of De
cember 4th an attempt was made there
to blow up with dynamite three men who
were sleeping in the same building. The
men were J. C. A. and C. L. La Plant,
owners of a shingle mill, and L. D. Wal
ters, their engineer. About 2 oclock in
the morning they awoke to find them
selves being lifted into the air. A mo
ment later they came down and went
through the Iloor with the beds in which
they had been sleeping and the debris
lof the building falling on top of them.
The men were partially stunned, but
they pulled themselves out and made
their way to a neighbor's house a quar
ter of a mile distant. The house was
•' tely wrecked, with all of its con-
I tents, the timbers belnr; smashed to
; kindling wood and the bedding beiiiri
: torn, to shreds.
l T nder the lloor was a large hole In the
ground caused by the explosion and the
supposition is that the dynamite was
placed in a bag. poked under the house
and then fired. It was a miracle that the
men escaped, everything else being ut
terly destroyed.

Washington Railroads Badly Crippisd
by Washouts—Repairs Impossible.
TACOMA. Dec. 7.—The Northern Pa
cific received word this morning that the
bridge across Carbon river on the Douty
branch, between Crocker and Carbona
do, had been washed out, and thait nine
loaded cars had fallen through Into the
water. The bridge is used almost ex-
rlusively to haul out the coal from tho
Carbon, hill mines. The acoident was
caused by the washing away of the
abutment at the west end of the bridge.
A wrecking crew and pile driver were
sent to the scene of the accident and
the superintendent hopes to have the
bridge again ready for traffic within :' g t
hours.
The water In White river is still up
I-to a height that renders work on the
now impassable Northern. Pacific bridge
impossible. A telegram was received
from there this morning asking for
an additional force of men, but Super
intendent MrCabe, upon learning that
the water had subsided only a foot dur
ing the night decided not to attempt
any repairs unit 11 tomorrow, or unW such
time as the water recedes sufficiently
as to allow the men to work to advan
tage.

WASHINGTON, Dec. 7.—The reas
sembling of the Fifty-fourth congress
today for the closing session was an
occasion of unusual brilliancy and inter
est because of the long, hard-fought po
litical battle waged during the recess.
The weather was perfect, and tha
throngs who streamed up the hill to
witness the opening ceremonies formed
an unorganized civic pageant. Gay
equipages conveyed diplomats, fashion
ables and those more prominent In civil
life, while unnumbered thousands moved
up Pennsylvania avenue on foot or In
the street cars. The corridors and gal
leries were soon thronged. There wern
demonstrations for conspicuously prom
inent statesmen. At 12 o'clock the regu
lar ceremonies attending the opening;
session and the reception of the presi
dent's annual communication to con
gress began.
IN THE SENATE.
The Reading of tbe Message Occupies
the Day.
WASHINGTON, Dec. 7.—The Urited
States senate began the second lessioa
ot the Fifty-fouith congees* with
crowded galleries and with that accom
paniment ot activity and ot greeting
that usuallly attends the reassembling
of congress. But the upper branch ot
congress never puts aside its dignity,
and the meeting developed no demon
strations or dramatic Incidents. Tha
reading of the president's message waa
the feature of the proceedings, and be
yond this no attempt was made to enter
upon the business of the session. To
many of the foreign representatived oc
cupying the diplomatic gallery the mes
sage had special interest and signifi
cance, owing to the part they had taken
in the conspicuous foreign events to
which the president referred. Sir Julius
Pauncefote, the British ambassador, andl
the new Turkish minister. Moustapha
Bey, were pre,:-ent. Senor Dupuy de
Lome, the Spanish minister, was not in
attendance during the day, but two of
the secretaries of the Spanish legation
carefully noted the references to this
Cuban conflict. Minister Hatch of Ha
waii, and Mr. Cooper, the Hawaiian
minister of foreign affairs, were listen
ers, although the message contained no
reference to the Hawaiian islands.
The diplomatic gallery was vacated)
as soon as the foreign questions refer
red to in the message had been read.
On the floor printed copies of the
message had been distributed, and thesa
gave the senators opportunity to read
the salient features instead of listening;
to them. As a result there was scant
attendance after the reading had pro
ceeded beyond the first half hour.
By U oclock the public galleries wero
well filled and crowds were at the en
trances unable to gain admission. Tha
floor of the chamber looked like a con
servatory, many desks bearing superb
floral decorations. Exactly at 12ocloclc
Vice President Stevenson entered and
called the senate to order, and Rev. Dr.
Milburn delivered an impressive invo
cation.
The roll cah showed seventy senators
| present.
•Senator Cullom was the first to receive
I recognition, offering a resolution that
' tne house be notified that the senate was
in session and ready to proceed with
business, which was agreed to. Senator
i Hale followed with a resolution that tha
! daily hour for meeting be 12 meridian.
! Agreed to.
Senator Sherman made the customary
j motion for a committee of senators andl
member-, to wait upon the president.
I Upon its adoption the presld' - officer
I named Senators Sherman ai Smith
; (Democrat) as the commlttt» of tha
I senate.
Senator Morrill (Vermont) presented
' several petitions asking for th" >««ag«
!of the Dingley bill. He yielded, how
| ever, to Hoar's suggestion that all bust
' ness be deferred as a matter of courtesy
I until the president and house of repro
-1 sentatlves had been communicated
j with. At 12:16 the senate took a receso
| until 1 oclock.
At 1 oclock there was a further reeese
I for thirty minutes, then another of flf
| teen minutes. At l:4f> Senator Shcr>
i man repnr'ed the president would com
j munioate his views In writing. Secre
tary Pruden of the White House staff
immediate ly stepped forward with th*
message, which General Cox, secretary
of the senate, read.
The main interest was shown In thai
first and last parts of the message,
wherein the president's personal views
were expressed, the interest lagging on
the review of the departmental
branches of the service.
The reading of the message closed at
3:35 p. m., having taken Just one hoar
and fifty minutes. The president*!
closing reference to trusts and monopo
lies was carefully followed by Mr. Sher
man, author of the anti-trust law to
which the president .referred. After th*
