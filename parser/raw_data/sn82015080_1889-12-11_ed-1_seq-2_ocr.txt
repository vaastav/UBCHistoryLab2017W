BARBER COUNTY INDEX.
BY E. P. CARUTHERS & W. G. MUSGROVE.

WEDNESDAY, DEC. 11. 1889.
Hartland bas been declared the coun
ty-seat of Kearney county, by the su
preme court.
Chas. S. Finch, formerly of Harper,
later of the Lawrence Tribune, hap
taken a position on the Kansas City
Globe.
With the exception of Judge John
ston, all the justices of the Kansas su
preme court are opposed to a constitu
tional convention.
The live stock exchanges of the coun
try formed a union, at Chicago, last
week. This means that cattle-raisers
must expect another "gouge" of some
kind higher prices for yardage, feed,
commissions, etc. Xo wonder that the
farmers are combining.
It is proposed to extend the life of
national banks by allowing them to de
posit state and municipal bonds as se
curity for their circulation. It will not
be long until national banks cannot get
government bonds, and friends of the
system want a substitute collateral for
the bank notes issued.
Silcott, cashier in the office of the ser-geant-at-arms,
of the lower house of
congress, skipped outlast week, with
$7:1,000 that did not belong to him. Part
of ttie money had been deposited by
members, and part drawn to pay mem
bers. The great question now among
the-victims, is, how to get back their
money. Another back salary grab
would even up things.
Our local horsemen should take an in
terest and membership in the Barber
and Harper County Horse Breeder's as
sociation. It is an organization that
can do a wonderful amount of good for
tills county, and if the proper effort is
made, Medicine Lodge can secure a
meeting next year. Those who would
like to become members should attend
the adjourned meeting to be held at
Hazel ton next Saturday.
Judge David J. Brewer, of Kansas,
has been appointed associate justice of
the United States supreme court, vice
Stanley Mathews, deceased. Judge
Brewer is a nephew of Judge Cyrus W.
Field ; he came to Kansas in 1859; was
a district judge several years; then as
sociate justice of the Kansas supreme
court, and in 1884 he was appointed
United States circuit judge. Ills ap
pointment meets with general favor
among Kansas republicans, though
there is a belief that he is more of a pol
itician than judge, and that his decis
ions have been shaped frequently in the
interest of furthering his political am
bition. The Anthony Republican favors the
calling of a convention at Wichita, to
take steps to advertise this part of Kan
saj to the world. That paper thinks
that as long as we have raised such
splendid crops, and our lands being so
cheap, an organized effort should be
made to advertise these facts among
people who are wanting homes in the
west. If every city and county would
become interested in this movement,
and, laying aside petty jealousies, all
work togethei , some good might be ac
complished by a convention. Barber
county is never slow to work for the
general good of Kansas, and if a meet
ing is held at Wichita, this county will
;io doubt be represented.
Con ressuien Springer, Mansur, Per
kins, SiruJer, Baker, Allen and Peel
have agreed upon a bill which will be
introduced at the earliest hour practi
cable, to organize the territory of Ok
lahoma. It is very comprehensive in
its scope, and deals with every phase of
the condition of affairs existing there.
Its provisions create a new territory, to
include the same area as the bill did
that failed in the last congress ; sub
divide it into five counties, Oklahoma
proper to constitute four; No-Man's-Land
a fifth ; extend the land laws over
o-Man's-Land, and to create new land
ofliees; give it a complete judicial sys
tem, and extend it over the territory of
Ihe live civilized trlbwa ; abolish the ju
risdiction of the federal courttfat Wich
ita, Paris and Fort Smith in the Indian
Territory ; create a new and novel sys
tem of town site laws that will protect
fill occupants in their just rights, and
extend the laws of Kansas, applicable
to the (tituation existing, until the end
of the first eion of the Oklahoma
legislature, in September next.
Secretary Rusk has received a report
from the agricultural experiment sta
tion in southwest Kansas, near Garden
City, announcing that it has-been dem
onstrated that the arid lands of the
west can be made productive without
the aid of Irrigation. Experiments at
the station named have proved that the
desert land, un irrigated produce
plentiful supplied of grasses and forage
plants, including sorghum, and it is
believed that wheat, corn and potatoes
Will grow equally as well. Only two
things were necessary to accomplish
these results: First, the ground was
pulverized deeply, to make a bed capa
ble of holding t!?e ster that falls in
tain ; and, second, the planted purface
was covered, aftfr sowing the first crp,
with matted straw, to keep the loam
from blowing away, and with it the
seed. Subsequent crops will require no
fltraw, for the reason that the matted
root will Keep the dry earth from being
blown away by the high winds. The
tibove statement Is as thin as the soil it
Intend to protect. They put straw on
the soil to keep the soil from blowing
away in the high winds, and then fall
to tell us how many men are required
to hold down an acre of straw when the
eoll-rippinir zephyrs are at play. Con
gress had just as well continue wasting
the surplus in the river and harbor job
as to tackle this Irrigation scheme. In
Barber county land is cheap, and any
kind ot a crop can be raised without Ir
rigation and without covering the plant
ed surface with straw to hold down the
soil. Our soil is sandy enough to be
mellow, but it has enough clay in it to
bold the sand. Barber county averaged,
this year, 45 bushels of corn, 25 bushels
of wheat, and $0 bushels of oats, and
where planted and cultivated for sugar,
the eorghum cane averaged 12 toua to
the acre, worth f 2 per ton ; its nugar
beets avernced J5l ton, worth S3 per
ton. There is roonfEere-fd twenty or
thirty thousand active, mtfci.."TT r
xners. and plenty of cheap, good land
oralL
HALF A MILLION POUNDS.
It is now certain that the sorghum
sugar output at Medicine Lodge, this
season, will exceed 00,000 pounds. It
was thought, until this week, that it
would not exceed 470,000 pounds, but
the "seconds" are much richer than was
anticipated.
This places the plant at Medicine
Lodge at the head of the list, as the
cujsi successiui one ever Duut. it has
paid every dollar due for cane and la
bor, and does not owe one cent on ac
count of the season's work. Yesterday
there was shipped from here seven
car loads of sorghum sugar, to New
Orleans. In the mall yesterday came
an order for 600 barrels of sugar, but
the order could only be partially filled.
Mr. Hinman says that he is satisfied
from the correspondence he has receiv
ed, that he could place ten thousand
barrels of Medicine Lodge sugar if he
bad it. People are dropping their prej
udices, and are now willing to acknowl
edge that sorghum sugar is better than
ordinary light brown sugar.
It is certain now that the worKs here
made good money this season, notwith
standing the delay in starting, and the
frequent accidents that occurred. Our
people all regard the industry as a suc
cess. The cane-raisers are all anxious
to contract to raise cane next year. It
pays twice as much as can be made on
corn, oats or wheat.
There appears to be a disposition to
class all sugar plants in Kansas togeth
er, and it looks very much like the sugar
trust had active allies in Kansas, who
are laboring to belittle the sorghum su
gar industry. Because the plants at
Liberal, Meade, Arkalon, Minneola and
Ness City could not start, lor want of
water or cane ; because the Fort Scott
cane fields were three times flooded and
very greatly injured ; because Conway
Springs and Attica were short of funds,
and did not pay for the cane or for the
labor employed, are no real arguments
against the industry. When a sorghum
sugar mill is properly built, on a suita
ble site, with plenty of pure water ac
cessible, in a locality that will raise cane
with sugar in it, and is conducted by
those who are willing to risk their own
capital in the enterprise, and pay their
honest debts, it will succeed, as the
plant at this place bas demonstrated.
On the other hand, if townships and
municipalities let a lot of adventurers
load a heavy bonded debt on them, and
attempt to operate the plant on the
funds voted by the people, and, besides,
pay for the building and machinery out
of the same funds, of course there will
be trouble. At two of the plants that
partially failed in Southern Kansas this
season, all of the money received from
the sale of sugar and syrup was applied
to debts due by the construction com
panies at the banks ; when, as a matter
of justice, the laborers who built the
mills and made the sugar, and the far
mers who furnished the cane, should
have been first paid.
The action of the state board of agri
culture in warning the western coun
ties against the indiscriminate voting
of sugarworks bonds, is timely, and
Secretary liohler should not be timid
in telling his constituents the truth and
the whole truth.
There is no more sense in a high and
dry county or township voting money
to build a sorghum sugar plant than
there would be in voting bonds to es
tablish a line of steamboats through
their sand-draws or dry canyons.
If it were possible, the state should
take steps to prohibit the wild voting
of bonds that is now going on. It will
prove the ruin of many townships, and
will do the legitimate sorghum sugar
business a great injury.
UNJON OF LABOR.
There was a meeting held at St. Louis
last week, that will probably be fre
quently referred to in the future, for It
was the beginning of a movement that
promises to spread to every state, coun
ty, city and town in this whole country
It was tb assembling of the represent
atives of three organisations of farmers
all national in their extent and the
executive committee of that other pow
erful body, the knights of labor. The
three organizations of farmers repre
sented were, the Farmers' and Labor
ers' Union of America ; the Northern
Alliance, and the National Farmers'
Alliance. All three of these organiza
tions were merged into one organiza
tion, known as the Farmers' and La
borers' ynion, and this confederation
then entered into, a eoniefenpp yyjth Mr.
Powderly and other representatives of
the Knights of Labor, with the result
that an understanding wag arrived at,
and on nearly all questions of general
interest to laboring men, the two or
ganizations will be in harmony. On
three subjects, especially, it was agreed
that the interests of the farmers and
other laborers were jdentlcaL$napce,
land and transportation. The .follow
ing resolutions were adopted on these
subjects :
Resolved, That congress issue a suf
iicient amount of fractional paper cur
rencj to facilitate exchange through
the medium of the United States mail.
iiegulypd. That we demand the free
and unlimited ooipaee of silver.
Resolved, That we demand the pas
sage of laws prohibiting the alien own
ership of (and, and that congress take
early action to devise some plan to ob
tain by purchase all lands now owned
by aliens and foreign syndicates, and
that all lands now held by railroad and
other corporators in excess of such as
is actually used by them, mirchased
by the government and held for actual
settlers only.
Resolved, That tha means of commu
nication and transportation shall be
controlled by and operated ip toe inter
est of the people, through the United
States postal system.
The election for officers of the Farm
ers' and Laborers' Union of America
for the ensuing year resulted as fol
lows : L. L. Tolk, of North Carolina,
president; B. II. Clover, of Kansas,
vice president ; J. II. Turner, of Geor
gia, secretary i II. 77 Ilickman, of
Missouri, treasurer; Ben. Terrell, of
Texas, lecturer.
Mr. Polk, the new president, is of the
James K. Polk family. He was in the
confederate army, as a private; was a
Clay whig before the war, and has been
a democrat since.
The confederation of the labor or
ganizations means that during the next
few years monopolies will have some
thing to think about. The masses are
satisfied that something is wrong, and
that reform is needed. They see that
the president of the United States wa3
elected by the money of the protected
ruofuippjists of the east ; they see that
the tariff Byt&) now in vogue Imposes
all its burdens on the goagufaer of the
ordinary necessaries of life: they see
the laborer's wases are getting
Rmiller -Us irs monopolistic em
ployer's profits are getting larger : they
see that combines are killing off legiti
mate competition, and that the inde
pendent manufacturer or dealer haspo
chance to successfully compete with the
vast combinations of wealth that form
the trusts of this country. The farm
ers have tried many experiments look
ing to freedom from their bondage ; but
their resolutions have usually been de
feated through the stupidity or rascal
ity of the leaders entrusted with them;
but it mav be that now the new federa
tion will work more harmoniously, for
it has certainly started out on a more
sensible basis. If the knights of labor
will work with the farmers harmoni
ously, that will make the combination
much stronger.
The indications are that the federa
tion will demand the adoption of the
Australian voting system, and that
means a purification of pelitics, to a
certain extent.
A resolution, adopted by the National
Farmers' Alliance, before the consoli
dation, on the subject of the tariff, was
as follows :
Resolved. That wp favnr Kiish rpvia.
ion and reduction ot the tariff that the
taxes mav rest aa hVht.lv n. nniM
upon productive labor, and that its bur
dens may be imDOsed unon the Inxnrle-i
and removed from the necessaries ot
life, and in a manner which will pre
vein, conunuea accumulations ot tne
united states treasury surplus.
JEFF. DAVIS DEAD.
Jefferson Davis died at the home of
U. Payne, in New Orleans, at 12:45
o'clock Friday morning, December 6th,
1889. He bad been sick for several
weeks, being attacked with a coneestive
chill while on a boat, going to New Or
leans. For several days his life was
dispaired of, and the announcement of
his death was no surprise.
He was born in Todd county. Ken
tucky, June 3, 1808 ; moved to Wilkin
son county, Mississippi, when quite
young; attended school at Transyl
vania, college, Ky.; was appointed to
the military academy at West Point,
and graduated in 1828 ; was assigned to
the frontier, and served in the Black
Hawk war. While a first lieutenant,
he eloped with, and married the daugh
ter of Gen. Zachary Taylor ; resigned
from the army, and engaged in raising
cotton, near vicksburg. In 1843 he
entered politics, being an active advo
cate of the Calhoun idea of state sov
ereignty; was an elector on the Polk
and Dallas ticket. The next year he
was sent to congress. He at once took
a prominent position, and was an ad
vocate of the low tariff adopted in 1846,
and he was enthusiastic for the aeeres-
sive measures adopted to secure the
annexation of Texas.
He went as colonel to the Mexican
war, taking the Mississippi volunteer
rifles. Before doing this he resigned
nis seat in congress, on the ground that
he was not entitled to the salary when
not in congress. He was prominent in
the battles of Monterey and Buena
Vista, and in the latter engagement he
was severely wounded. He returned to
Mississippi in 1847, and again entered
public life. President Polk conferred
on him the rank of brigadier-general of
militia, but Mr. Davis declined the
honor, claiming that the president had
no constitutional authority to confer
such a title or rank on an oflicer of state
militia. Here his idea of state's richts
again showed itself.
In 1847 he was selected as United
States senator to fill anmexpired term,
and in 1850 he was elected to a full
term. He was a recognized leader, as
he was in the house ; but he resigned
his seat to run for governor of Missis
sippi, against a "Union" party that did
not believe much in state's rights. He
was defeated. He worked for Pierce's
election, and in J853 was tendered the
war portfolio by Mr. Pierce, lie served
four years.
In 1857 he was again elected to the
senate, and engaged in the great Kansas-Nebraska
debate. In 1860 he sup
ported the Breckinridge ticket. In De
cember of that year he made the great
speech in which he declared that while
the independence of the states had cost
blood and treasure, their union had
cost nothing, -his was accepted as the
key-note of the southern position.
January 9. 1861, Mississippi seceded.
The next day Mr. Davis spoke in favor
of the right of secession. On the 24th
of the same month he made a farewell
address, and resigned irom the senate.
He went back to Mississippi, and at
once assumed the position 6i cohl!"'J-
er-in-chieftf the army of that state, to
which position be had been appointed :
but on February 18th he accepted the
position of president of the confederate
states, to which position he bad been
elected by the provisional congress, at
Montgomery. He had the capital re
moved to Richmond, and remained
there the greater part of the war. His
war record need not be mentioned here.
He was loved by many, but his admin
istration was pot satisfactory to all.
He was severely criticized for many of
his orders ; and even yet he is censured
by many southern people for beine the
cause of the failure of the rebellion. At
the close of the war he had lost much
of his popularity, and had the federal
government treated him as it treated
other contederates, he would never have
regained that popularity. All the abuse
that was heaped on him was accepted
by the people of the south as being in
tended for them, and it drew them back
to him in bonds of love stronger than
they uZZ ?v been.
In May, 1865, he was captured,
for nearly two years was confined at
Fortress Monroe. He was finally ad
mitted to bail in the sum of 9100,000,
Horace Greeley being his first surety.
For seven years afterward he was
connected with an insurance company,
at Memphis, but he lost much money
in the venture, and in 1S78 he took pos
session of Beauvoir, a plantation be
queathed to him by Mrs. Dorsey, an
aged and wealthy southern widow.
Here he spent bis declining years in
contentment.
His first wife died within a year after
marriage. His second wife was a Miss
Howell, of Georgia. He was the father
of two children, Jefferson, who died of
yellow fever, in 1878, and Miss Winnie,
who is now on her way home from
France, where she has been on account
of her health.
When the genera) amnesty bill was
be Tore congress, in 1876, an amendment
excepting Jeff. Davis from its opera
tions, was offered by Mr. Blaine. It
was then that Mr. Blame and Ben. Hill
had their famous debate, and in that
discussion it was that Mr. Hill referred
to Mr. Blaine as belonging to a large
class who were VJnylsible In war and
invincible in peace."
THE POPE'S BANK. '
The most gigantic financial scheme
ever talked of is iiow being discussed by
the newspapers. The New York Her
ald last week devoted a page to astate
ment of the proposed formation of an
extensive bank, under the direction of
the Pope-of Rome. The institution,
according to the Herald, is to liaye a
capital of $100,000,000; the main place
of business is to be in New York city,
with branches in London, Paris, Borne,
Berlin, Hamburg, Vienna, St. Peters
burg, Barcelona and Havanna, and in
the principal cities of the United States.
The bank and its branches will conduct
a regular banking business. In addi
tion, the company will have the power
to organize and conduct colonies, com
merce and manufactures, and to con
struct railroads, build works of art, go
into agriculture, create watei works,
manufacture gas and electricity, build
sewers, and, in fact, engage in all kinds
ot industrial works, public and private.
But there is another, and perhaps
greater point sought to be gained by the
establishment of a Catholic bank In the
United States. For many years the
pope has felt the need of a safe deposit
ory for hU money in the event of a war
In Europe or a serious trouble with the
Italian government. Am erica has been
selected as the only country where an
institution could be founded that would
not be subject to seizure and loss.
Under the stais and stripes the for.
eign branches, when the expected arrt
conflagration takes place In Europe,
win, ic is asserted, be as safe as if peace
reigned, and all other property bad not
been confiscated.
The revenues of the Catholic church.
and of all individuals, companies and
corporations that may desire it. will be
handled by the pope's bank.
If it materializes, it will be the largest
establishment in the world.
THE MESSAGE.
The president's message was read to
congress, Tuesday, Dec. 3d. and we
could not publish any notice of it last
weetc. However, the reader did not lose
anything. It was the weakest message
ever delivered by a president and, in the
language of Senator Ingalls, "it really
made the weak effusions of Haves ap
pear respectable." Hr. Harrison de
clares himself in favor of a revision of
the tariff laws, but says the protective
principles must be maintained and fair
ly applied to the products of thearm
as, well as of our shops. That is pure
rot it is meaningless. He is opposed
to letting the banks have public money
without paying interest. That is right.
He wants the Cherokee and other In
dian lands opened to settlers. That is
also right. But then he goes on and
recommends that congress take super
vision of the election of its members,
and especially in the south. He wants
the poor "colored man" to be given the
full enjoyment of all his civil rights.
He means, of course, that the negro
should be put in control of the south.
The negroes, themselves, when educa
ted, object to being called "colored
men." The president again declares in
favor of the civil service law. He is in
favor of national aid to education the
Blair bill, for instance and would have
the national treasury contribute to the
education of the children where there
is most ignorance. He is in favrof
subsidies to steamship companies ope
rating between this country and Cen
tral and South America, China, Japan,
and other islands of the great ocean.
Even his strongest partisans say! the
president's message is weak and unsat
isfactory. It does not outline a policy ;
it is vacillating and one-sided and will
not be considered by congress any more
than it would consider one of Mr. Har
rison's campaign speeches. It is a
child's first composition as compared
with the message of Mr. Cleveland, and
it is silly as compared with the tariff
message of 1887.
Ilazelton Happenings. ,
Sunday, the 15th, ought to be a big
day in Ilazelton. The M. E. church
holds quarterly meeting on that day and
the M, E. church, south, holds quarter
ly meeting the same day ; also the
Christian church has preaching that
day. . . .Cattle are still dying from ,the
stalk field complaint. The latest cases
we have heard of are James Hackney,
east of town, and Zeb Wood worth, north
of town. The former lost three head
and the latter so far only one. . . .Rev.
Fay is still holding meetings at Kiowa.
A. iaK!. pumber bas been added to the
church and the interest is still good. . . .
Rev. Foose is holding a protracted meet
ing at the Pedar Yallpy schoo house,
and it is reported that the whole com
munity is greatly interested and a large
number have been converted . . .The in
terest in the meeting at the Christian
church is still kept up. It actually be
gins to look as though the sinner could
not escape in this part of Kansas. . . .
John Harden has returned from bis old
home in Illinois, looking fat and heal
thy, and has many good words to say
for Illinois. . . .A petition asking for a
herd law in Ilazelton township is being
largely signed by the natives.... S. S.
Robinson went up to Wichita and spent
the week looking at fine chickens. He
had on exhibition several fine birds
from his flock and carried off several
premiums, besides making some good
sales. He is well pleased with his trip
... .A fine boy at H. Chedister's, of reg
ulation weight. Dr. Erwin was master
of ceremonies. . . .John Mc Williams has
gone to the eastern part of the state on
business of a matrimonial nature. . . T
The farmers are going to organize an
Alliance at Hazelton during the coming
week, after which they propose to buy
their coal and lumber at reduced prices.
If, while they are at the business, they
will take some time to study the effects
of the tariff on what they buy, there is
no doubt but what in a short time they
will be a unit for a low tariff or for free
trade. It is a question that the farmers
have, as yet, studied very little, but
they are gradually getting interested
. . . .Such letters as the one published in
the Express, last week, stating that
Hazelton had about 1,000 population, a
national bank, a $12,000 academy and a
$10,000 church, are not calculated to do
the good that might be done by the wri
ter confining himself more closely to
facts. TV. C. A.
