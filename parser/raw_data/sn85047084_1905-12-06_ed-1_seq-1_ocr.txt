OOVERNO
CARTER TO
PRESIDENT
A Letter Upon Which the National
Executive Based Mis Hawaiian
Recommendations.
f

Following is a letter to the President accompanying Governor Carter's
report to the "Secretary of the Interior in which the Governor enlarges upon
and emphasizes the financial condition of the Territory and the need of relief
at the hands of Congress. This is the letter upon which the President based
the Hawaiian recommendations in his message, which went to Congress yester
day. The first suggestion of the idea that the Federal revenues collected in the
Territory should be partly refunded, was made to the Governor by TJ. S. District
Attorney Breckons when Gov. Carter was framing his recommendations:
Honolulu, Oct. 12, 1905.
"The President: In your Message to
Congress last year you were good
enough to accept a suggestion from
me, and as a result of the impetus
"which, your action gave, a small ap
propriation was passed by the Federal
Government for the study of leprosy,
.nd I have yet to hear the first com
ment of disapproval. Congressman
Hepburn isited the Settlement last
June, arid I am sure that no act of his

have paid into the Federal Treasury
$6,059,171.51, half as much again as the
total debt assumed at the time of an
nexation. Over one million dollars is
being taken out of this country every
year and placed in Uncle Sam's cof
fers. Is there any area of 6640 square
miles on the mainland (this is about
the size of Connecticut and Rhode Is
land together) which with only 155,000
people could stand up for five years
under such a strain? Were it not for

measure.
finally results in a cure, our great
benign Government will have lifted a
- curse from humanity the extent of
which few people in the Temperate
Zone realize.
To my mind, the two most important
problems in relation to Hawaii are con
nected with immigration and finance.
' So far as immigration is concerned, I
am not yet convinced but what there
may be a solution of it without the
necessity of congressional action. There
are a few here who are making a
splendid effort to work out our own
Y" solution. For instance, a proposition
Is formulating under which I may take
in one instance a very radical position
so far as our public lands are concern
ed, and force the cutting up into small
nomesteads of a large sugar estate,
the lease of which from the Territory
expires in the spring of 1907. If we
can successfully homestead this land
with three or four thousand Russians,
it may mean the starting of a tide of
Immigration which would work won
ders in developing the future of the
islands, thus in the end justifying the
loss of money that would otherwise
be received if the land were put up
at auction, as well as the loss of
production and taxes during the period
involved in the change.
The second problem, that of finances,
Is the real purpose of this letter.
England's experience in handling de
pendencies or non-contiguous areas has
demonstrated that wherever she de
pended uron them for revenue and ;so
"burdened them she failed.
I have heard it expressed that Hawaii
-was annexed too soon; that the Su
preme Court decision had not develop
ed the idea of a "possession," and
-that Hawaii should not have been a
Territory.
Be that as it may, the fact remains
Since annexation we have been de
nied additional cheap labor, the price
of which has constantly increased: and
I take it you deem it wise to maintain
such a policy. Then how are we to
meet this strain? Something should
be done to relieve it.
Sugar from the Philippines will in
all probability be admitted to mainland
markets free. The price of labor in
the Philippines will be less than in Ha
waii, her margin of profit on sugar
higher than ours. Her production will
increase rapidly and supply the west,
anj poor little Hawaii will be left bear
ing its burden of taxes and contribu
tions far in excess of the Philippines
and yet obliged to compete with them.
Senator Foraker once suggested that
he believed it better for Hawaii to
give up its present status as a Terri
tory and accept that of a "posses
sion," working out her own destiny,
freed from the necessity of submitting
to the application of every law passed
by Congress in response to the needs
of conditions as they exist on the
mainland. Free to use all of the rev
enues collected from her people in
their own development. Free to make
laws for her own conditions, relieving
Congress from the necessity of except
ing her from the application of those
laws passed in response to the needs
of the United States proper. In such
a position, all legislation by Congress
concerning Hawaii would be special
and considered only in the light of her
best interests, such as is in a general
way the position of Porto Rico. He
made this remark: "We are taking a
million dollars each year out of Ha
waii which we do not need, and we
should find some way of stopping it."

The Hawaii Promotion Committee
met in regular session yesterday aft

matters of prime importance to Hono

betterment of all roads in the city,
especially those connecting the town

Secretary Wood called the attention
to the "See America First" movement

in which Hawaii had been asked to
assist in attracting the great mass of
traveling people of the east, to the

with the Commercial Club and others

ONE THOUSAND PORTUGUESE
FAMILIES TO BE IMPORTED
An addition of five thousand Portuguese to the population of this Territory
is now on the tapis. The Board of Immigration favors it and the planters will
put up the necessary funds. All that remains is the securing of a proper agent
to represent the planters and the immigration board in Europe.
Ernest Wodehouse was offered the plaee, as stated in yesterday's Adver
tiser, but he declined it. The planters have appointed a committee to wait on
Governor Carter and ascertain whether or not he would permit Secretary A.
L. C. Atkinson, who is also Chairman of the Board of Immigration, to attend
-to this double mission for the Board and the planters. It is thought that the
.additional dutv would not interfere seriously with "Jack's" work as Secretary
of the Territory, as the details could be left to other men to work out once Mr.
.Atkinson had the plans well laid.
The resolution passed by the Flanters' Association yesterday morning was
a a fnllnws- '
"Resolved, That we hereby favor the importation of 1000 agricultural Por
tuguese families, not to exceed'five thousand people, from the Azores or Madeira
Islands at the earliest possible moment and that we are prepared to contribute
to the Board of Immigration sufficient funds for the carrying on of this immi
gration." v ,
It will probably be necessary for whoever goes to proceed to London and
arrant for steamer accommodations. It is something of a job to move oOOO
people and the item of transportation and subsistence needs to be well thought
out and investigated before final contracts are made. It is estimated that it
would cost about $100 to bring one person around the Horn, or an even half
million dollars to bring 5000 immigrants, while by bringing them by the way
of Tehuantepee the cost would be but $275,000. Naturally the planters want a
man to handle that amount .of money in whom they have implicit confidence.
The connection of the planters with the immigration will be necessarily
unofficial, as onlv state or territorial governments are permitted to assist immi
gration, but as there is no appropriation for carrying the work of the immigra
tion board on, the planters are contributing the necessary funds.

that immediate steps be taken for the fortification of the Territory, for it is
hard to overestimate the strategic importance of Hawaii and the need for
proper fortifications, f
TERRITORY TOO HEAVILY TAXED.
The Territory, the message says, is too heavily taxed and Congress should
enact laws setting aside a period, say of twenty years, during which time 75
per cent, of the internal revenue and customs receipts of Hawaii should be
pread in a fund for education, for construction of public buildings, and the
development of the military and naval defences of the Islands.
