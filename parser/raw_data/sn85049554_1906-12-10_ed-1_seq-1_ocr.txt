VOLUME THIRTY-TWO
Says Uncle Sam Is Compelled to
Pay Too Much For Carry
ing Privileges
WANTS AN INVESTIGATION
Washington, D. C., Dec. 10.—Post
master General Cortelyou has submit
ted his annual report to congress. It
ehows a deficit of more than $10,000,
000, reflects by Intimation on the rail
roads for withholding information that
might tend to reduce carrying charges,
urges a ship subsidy to facilitate for
eign mails, recommends reform in the
second class mail system, favors ifl
creasing employes' wages, declares for
a parcels post on rural routes, and rec
ommends that politics give way to bus
iness methods in the department. Con
cerning the deficit the postmaster gen
eral says: V' /.'.
"I repeat what I stated a year ago,
that altho It would be a gratifying cir
-cumstahce if the postoffice department
•were self-sustaining, I '.am less con
cerned about the deficit than about the
efficiency of administration."
After reviewing the fruitless efforts
since 1879 to secure data £rom the rail
..•* roads on which to base estimates for
the railway postal service the report
continues:
''The departments present relation to
the matter of pay for postal cars is far
froiri satisfactory. From a business
point of view the compensation wouid
seem to Be excessive.
"If the government is paying too
-much for the carriage of the mails thai
fact should be determined in justice
to the government. If it is not that fact
ahould be determined in Justice to the
f: transportation interests.
Concerning foreign mails, Postmaster
General Cortelyou says:
V-The
mail steamers of other coun-
tries leaving ports of the United States
,will absorb more .and more our for
01
gn mall transportation until such
... time as the United States provides an
adequate compensation for the outward
voyage on steamers of equal speed and
regularity of sailing.
"The unprecedented expansion of
trade and' foreign commerce justifies
prompt consideration of an adequate
toreign mail service.
"Expenditures to this end seem fully
warranted also from the standpoint of
a. proper riaval establishment, inas
much as the vessels performing gerv
ice are so built as to be readily con
"verted into auxiliary cruisers. Legis
lation on this subject is urgently need
ed."
On the subject of higher wages the
Report says:
"The highest efficiency in any serv
ice can be attained only by furnishing
the natural and proper incentives of
recognition of merit and adequacy
of compensation.
"One of the most important steps,
therefore that can be taken for the
immediate betterment of' the postal
service lies In increases- of compensa
tion .among certain classes of em
ployes.
"ifhe employes of this service have a
right to expect that their chosen vo
cation shall yield a sufficient income
to meet current expenses and provide
a. little in addition for the needs of
'the family in times of sickness and
misfortune. The increased cost of liv
hig, together with the multiplying re
sponsibilities which result from the
phenomenal growth of the postal serv
ice,- fairly entitles many of its clerks
and other employes to an increase of
i. salary."
The postmaster general also asks for
..a deputy who-shall be over all assist
ant postmasters general and be a sort
of general manager. He also wants a
•force of statisticians, which may cost
from $15^000 to $30,000.
The report has this to say of rural
free delivery:
"There can be further economies in
rural delivery without any impairment
of that service. By a more precise
method of determining the basis of pay
for the transportation of the mails tha
department can be relieved of an un
businesslike feature of administration
with a probable decrease in expendi
itures.
"I recommend that provision be made
for the carriage by rural carriers, at a
fair rate of postage, of small parcels.
"I co-operation with the. department
of agriculture, systematic efforts have
been made during the year to secure
the Improvement of the roads travers
ed by rural carriers in Illinois, Iowa,
Maine, Minnesota, Missouri, New Jer
sey, New Tork, and Wisconsin. Post
masters of rural delivery offices have
been requested to aid state and local
officials in all efforts to secure th.»
betterment of the highways on which
rural routes are maintained."
In conclusion, the report says:
"I know of no one thing that will do
more for the postal service than con
tinued insistence upon the policy of
substituting business for politics in the
administration of its affairs."

PRIZE IS VALUED AT $40,000
It Was Conferred Upon President
Roosevelt by Norwegian Parliament,
In Recognition of His Services in
Bringing Peace Between Russia and
Japan—History of Prizes.
Christiana, Dec. 10.—The Norwegian
parliament has conferred the Nobel
peace prize, valued at $40,000. ,upon
President Roosevelt, In recognition of
his services in the Russo-Jap war.
Candidates for the prize must be
proposed by legislative bodies, peace
organizations or universities. It is un
derstood that the president's sponsors
were Professor H. P. Judson, of Chi
cago University Professor Baldwin, of
Yale: Professor Harberger. of the Uni
versity of Munich, and the faculty of
Georgetown University, Washington.
The peace prize went last year to
Baroness Von Suttner, of Vienna, and
in the previous years to W. H. Creem
er, member of parliament, of England:
Professor De Martens, of Russia, and
Henri Duroant, founder of the Red
Crosi
The peace prize is a part of the be
quest left by Dr. Alfred Bernhard No
bel, the Swedish scientist, who died in
1896. By his will, a large portion of
•his fortune was devoted to five annual
prizes, each valued at about $40,000.
They are awarded for the most im
portant discoveries in physics, chemis
try, physiology or medicines, and for
most distinguished work of an ideal
istic tendency in the field of literature
and for the best effort toward the fra
ternity of nations and promotion of
peace.

American Minister Pierce, in an elo
quent speech, thanked parliament in
the president's name and read the fol
folwing message from the president:
"I am profoundly gratified and
touched by the signal honor shown me
thru your body in conferring on me the
Nobel peace prize. There is no gift I
could appreciate more and wish it were
in my power fully to express my grat
titude. Thank you for it, thank you in
behalf of the United States, for what I
did I am able to accomplish only as the
representative of the nation of which
for the time being I am president. Af
ter much thought I have concluded
the best and most fitting way to apply
the amount of the prize is by using it
as a fund to establish at Washington
a permanent Industrial peace commit
tee. The object will be to strive for
better and more equitable relations
among my countrymen who are engag
ed, whether as capitalists, or wage
workers, in industrial and agricultural
pursuits. This will carry out the pur
pose of the founder of the prize, for, in
modern life, it is important to work
for the cause of just and righteous
peace in the industrial world as in the
world of nations. I again express to
you assurances of my deep and last
ing gratitude and appreciation.

CHANGES FAITH NOW A NUN.
Omaha Woman Resigns Positiop and
Gives $10,000 to Church.
Omaha, Neb., Dec. 10.—Miss Grace
Waring, a daughter of a Methodist
minister and for many years a member
of the Congregational church, has re
signed her position as secretary to
Judge Munger of the United States dis
trict court, entered the Convent of
Mercy in this city and will in due time
take the veil. She has deeded property
valued at $10,000 to the Catholic
church. The announcement of Miss
Waring's intention to become a nun
came as a distinct shock and surprise
to her family and friends.
Not even her most intimate friends
know when Miss Waring began to be
interested in the Catholic church and
to consider the question of be'coming a
nun, but it is suspected that it: was last
summer, when she was abroad. In Eu
rope she met and spent considerable
time with two Sisters of Mercy
from Cuba, who talked much to her
about the church and its sisterhoods,
and, it is supposed, led her eventually
to become a Catholic. At Rome Miss
Waring was granted an audience and
blessed by Pope Pius, and this, too, it
is suspected, may have influenced her
become a communicant of the Cath
olic church.
On her return to Omaha from abroad
Miss Waring said nothing about a
change of faith. She resumed her work
as secretary to Judge Munger and con
tinued it until two weeks ago, when she
handed in her resignation. She first
went to Oskaloosa, Iowa, for a brief
visit with her father. She then return
ed to Omaha and entered the Convent
of Mercy.

all of which he claims tend to bear

Mrs. Storer showed a letter from

in which the reason for the transfer of
the Stokers from Madrid to Vienna
was made clear. Mrs. Storer had re
quested the transfer because of the
health of her son, who was suffering
from a pulmonary complaint and could
not visit her on account of the climate
of Madrid. In this letter Vice President
Roosevelt states he would urge the

^'Ireland told me the president, on-' remalr.s of the( Lund hotel guest who
several occasions in conversation with lost his life in the fire last week, not
•him, took the credit for the action he having seen his son since July, and
now repudiates.
The crux of the whole matter which
led to my removal was the action taken
by Mrs. Storer and myself with regard
to the promotion of Archbishop Ire
land. of St. Paul, to the cardinalate. In
my letter to the president and cabinet
I cite letters written by Roosevelt to
me speaking in the highest terms of
IMgr. Ireland and expressing the per
sonal wish that the country might prof
it by his promotion to the cardinalate.
Dec. 2, 1903, I had an audience with
Pope Pius, at which I transmitted a
verbal note, the basis of which had
been given to me by Roosevelt. I was
particularly careful in its preparation,
and after transcribing it into English I
translated it into French and conveyed
it to the pope. That communication is
as follows:
'He said to me he would authorize
me to say to your holiness that the
archbishop of St. Paul is his personal
friend and that he possessed his whole
confidence as a prelate and citizen
that he earnestly desired for Mgr. Ire
land all the honors of the church that
he would view with the greatest pleas
ure and satisfaction the elevation and
rank of cardinal for Monsignor Ire
land.'
"Now as to the charge that I acted
without warrant in the matter, I have
only to cite the fact that Ireland, in
conversation with me, told me that
Roosevelt told him of all. I had done,
and instead of criticising me for my ac
tions, seemed to take great credit to
myself. Everything was all right until
a section of the New York churches be
gan to agitate the elevation of another
archbishop than Ireland.
"They pointed out to Roosevelt that
the New York prelate had at least as
much claim to the red hat as the
archbishop of St. Paul. This resulted
in .much perturbation at the White
House and letters were sent to me by
Roosevelt pointing out that what might
be very appropriate a« the opinion of a
private citizen would come with very
bad grace as president of the United
States. Every one with a grain of
sense knows that. There never has
been a question as to that. I knew in
the entire transaction that I was not
presenting the official views of the
president. This separation of the of
ficial and personal sides of the matter
is not unique. McKinley did the same
thing. He favored the elevation of Mgr.
Ireland but did not do as president of
the United States. Roosevelt favored
the elevation of the archbishop but he
did not do so under the great seal of
the United States. All that was per
fectly clear and there was no chance
of misconstruction." On my word, I
thought I was obeying a personal re
quest of Theodore Roosevelt when I
presented his oral note to Pope Pius
X. I caused all correspondence in the
case to be compiled into pamphlet un
der legal advise and had it printed in
Boston soon after I reached home. I
wish to state that each copy of it was
sent out with a personal letter request
ing personal consideration."
"The result was that the main part
of the pamphlet was sent broadcast
from Washington to the various news
channels. My reasons for publishing
the pamphlet were two-fold. In the
first place, like any American husband,
it was my duty to defend the name of
my wife from imputations of alleged
wrong doing. In the second place, it
Waa otoligatory upon me to defend my-

Emergency hospital, where Brown Is.
Their investigation showed slight evi
dences of septic poisoning.
The patient 'has been In a stupor
most of the day. A sudden turn for tho
worse with fatal results may occur at
any time.
Former Senator Brown is past 6.0
years of age. His habits of living have
•been such, the physicians say, as to
render liim particularly susceptible to
septic poisoning and retard recupera
tion.
Just before tho patient was placed
on an operating table at the Emergency
hospital he directed that several tele
grams be sent to members of his fam
ily and friends.
He was on the operating table for
three hours. Since coming from un

prisoners, white and colored, on the
charge of assault to murder and hekS
without bail. She is on the verge of
collapse and has been under tihe con
stant care of a physician all day.
Senator George Sutherland of Utah,
for whom Mrs. Bradley sent as soon as
she was arrested, declared yesterday
that she was mentally irresponsible for
her act. The police are inclined to
agree with this view.
•She has steadily refused to take any
nourishment since the shootimg except
to sip coffee, consequently she Is in a
highly (nervous state today.
She Inquired frequently concerning
the condition of Brown and expressed
the hope that he would recover. At
midnight she made efforts to send
messages to the victim, who was in no
condition to receive or answer them.
