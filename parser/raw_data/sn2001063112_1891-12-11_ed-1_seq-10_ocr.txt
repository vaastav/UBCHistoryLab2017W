Dec. 8.—The heavy rain
Gloria which visited the city during the
morning had little effect in dampening
the ardor of persons desirous of witness
ing the opening of the Fifty-second con
gress, and at an early hour a great
crowd surged through the corridors of
the Capitol. Especially was this true
111 the house wing, where there was no
vdnt to relieve the crowd owing to the
tact that the galleries were kept closed
order to let the Democrats hold
their caucus. The utmost good feeling
prevailed, however, and the marble
stairs were improvised into seats by the
porters. Hardly had the caucus ad
journed when a wild rush was made for
the gallery, and in a few minutes every
available seat in the long benches was
occupied, and the less fortunate
spectators were compelled to view
the scene over each other's
shoulders from the door recesses.
Promptly at noon the session was
opened by Clerk McPherson, who at
once proceeded to call the roll. The
call disclosed the presence of 326 of 33a
members, the absentees being Messrs.
Wilson, of Kentucky Ryan, of Mis
souri Rartine, of Nevada Sanl'ord, of
New York, and Buchannan, of Virginia.
Immediately after the conclusion of the
roll call, at 12:20, on motion of Mr. Hol
liian, the house adjourned for the day.
The senate was called to order by Vice
President Morton promptly at 12 o'clock
During the presentation of credentials
in the senate, Mr. Sherman, referring
to the eligibility of Mr. Brice as senator
from Ohio, said that before the oath of
office was administered to Mr. Brice he
wanted to say that the belief was enter
tained by a large part of the citizens of
Ohio that lie was not a citi
zen of that sta,t:e at the time
of his election and therefore was not
eligible. He (Mr. Sherman) was satisfied
Mr. Brice was entitled to be sworn in
on his prima facie credentials. They
were regular in form and therefore
should raise no objection to this being
done. But he simply gave this notice
so that Mr. Brice's being sworn in
should no be regarded as in favor of the
point raised by the people of Ohio that
he was not a citizen of that state at the
time of election. Mr. Hoar suggested
that the correction be made that Mr.
Brice was not an "inhabitant" of Ohio
and Mr. Sherman accepted the correc-'
tion substituting the words inhabitant
for citizen. Mr. Brice was then es
corted to the desk and sworn in.
At 1 o'clock the senate adjourned for
the day.

THE FIGHT STILL ON.
No Kcnult Reached l»v the Demoei'atic
Speakership Caucus.
WASHINGTON', Dec. 7.—Two hours be­
fore the hour set for the convening of
the Fifty-second congress, the Demo
cratic members of the lower branch of
that body met in the hall of the house
for the purpose of selecting a candidate
for speaker, pursuant to the adjourn
ment taken after the protracted and fa
tinuing session of Saturday. Ten o'clock
is an early hour for the average mem
ber of congress and those entitled to at
tend the caucus were slow in assemb
ling. Chairman Holman arrived at tho
house at 9:40, followed a few minutes
later by Mr. Springer, who looked as
happy and cheerful as ever, and wore
his everlasting rosebud in the lapel of
his coat. Judge Crisp was the next of
the candidates on the ground, and he
occupied most of the time between his
arrival and the hour the.caucus met in
earnest convessation with Mr. Blount
one of his lieutenants.
Mr. Mills came to the capitol before
the meeting of the caucus. He seemed
bright and cheerful and did not show
any signs of the partial prostration from
which he suffered during the night.
Messrs. McMillin and Hatch were also
on the battlefield. All the speakership
candidates occupied the headquarters
committee rooms on the house floor,
which were assigned to them on Satur
day, and little knots of supporters of the
members gathered about each and gave
his individual views of the situation as
seen in the light most favorable to his
favorite. There was practically no at
tempt made at missionary work before
the caucus met. The various candi
dates had exhausted their resources
Sunday in assaulting the line
of each opponent, but with
out perceptible result, and the Demo
cratic members entered the caucus with
out an inkling of what the day would
briug forth. The caucus was called to
order by Chairman Holman shortly
after 10 a. m., and the roll call was an
swered by -'12 members, lo less than at
tended the caucus of Saturday. New
arrivals kept coining in all the time,
however, and swelled the number.
Calling the roll on the eighteenth
ballot was then begun and 226 members
veted as follows:
Crisp 94, Mills 90, McMillin 19,
Springer 17, Hatch 5, Stevens 1.
The nineteenth ballot showed no
fiiange and adjournment was taken to
attend the opening session of congress.
On the twenty-third ballot Mr. Hatch
voted for Crisp, the vote standing, Crisp
100, Mills 94, Springer 13, McMillin 19,
Stearns 1.
The twenty-fourth ballot resulted:
Crisp 101, Mills 95, Springer 18, Mc
Millin 11, Stevens 1 total 228. There
arc now 228 members voting. It takes
115 to elect McClellan, of Indiana, left
Springer for Mills on the twenty-fourth
ballot.

Tracks His Miin to Washington Stato,
TACOMA, Wash., Dec. 8.—Silas Speed,
sheriff of Barron county, Wis., arrived
in this city during the evening with
Gustav Erickson, whom he captured at
Sidney on a warrant charging him with
the murder of his father near Chetek',
Wis. in September, 1890. Sheriff Speed
was highly elated over his capture, and
says he has been on the young man's
trail for over a year. At one time,
month's ago, he traced him as far as
Denver, but there he lost the' trail and
returned to Chetek. Several weeks ago
Erickson wrote a letter from Sydney to
a former friend' at Chetek, and his
friend answered, posting a letter ad
dressed to him in the Chetek postoffice.
The postmaster recognized the name
and notified the sheriff and the latter
immediately left for Sydney, arriving
there Friday morning. The prisoner
said he was tired of evading the authori
ties and would go back without a requi
sition.

the steamer Vergil Price, tied up at her
wharf and cut the Price in two, sinking
her instantly. The Olympian was

aboard at the time and went down to
the bottom with the steamer, but came
to the surface, grabbed hold of the
wharf and was rescued. Loss about

A DECISIVE POLICY.
ft IK Kxpected to In
th« Chilian Matter.
NEW YOUK, DOO.
S.—A special to The
Recorder from Washington says the
policy of the administration in regard
to the Chilian question is something of
a puzzle to most, persons in Washington,
but all agree that some move will be
made this week and that by S'trrilay
night a decisive foreign policy will be
put forward in place of the wavering
one that has caused 110 little comment
cbiring the past few weeks. The presi
dent and Secretary Blaine, it seems,
were in favor of making a demand on
Chili in regard to the Baltimore affair
savoring of an ultimatum, but Secro
tary Tracy asked for delay until he
could get an efficient squadron in mo
tion, and Postmaster General Wann
maker was in favor of arbitrating the
Matter. Mr. Wanamaker, it is said,
threatened to resign if a display of force
was resorted to. It was finally decided
that it would be unwise to have a split
in the cabinet over the matter and it
was agreed that the question should re
main in abeyance until congress should
convene, and in the meantime all prepar
ations should be made for any emer
gency. The rule has been strictly
adhered to.
ICxteiiKtve Naval .Preparations
have been going on and the result is that
two powerful fleets now have their bows
turned toward the south. Now that
everything is ready it is expected that
President Harrison will show his hand
and insist that his aggressive policy be
carried out. It is believed that the facts
as related above will be stated in the
president's message, but what will fol
low after this is a matter of conjecture.
Some believe that Mr. Harrison will ask
for a large appropriation in order that
the country may bo put on a war foot
ing that simultaneously with this re
quest he will make the demand on Chili
Ind will consider that the text of his
message and that the two powerful
fleets that have their bows turned to
ward Chili will be tuiiicieut display of
force to convince that country that the
demand must have
Kespectfnl ami Immediate Attention.
Others think that congress will U? a-ked
to vote upon the question whether an
ultimatum shall be sent to the southern
republic or not. It is bslieved vh.it be
fore the president aa.l Secretary Ulcine
eat their Christmas dinner Chili will
either apologize for her insults :md make
reparation for tho crimes of her cann
trymen or wi:l be taught that in time
of peace Uncle Sam has prepared for
war. Tiie text of the raport of the sec
retary of tho navy has a very i-.yMili
cant bearing oa the matter. One sen
tence shows that Secretary Tracy o-itvr
tains the same view as does Provident
Harrison:
"There are outrages that cannot go
unredressed there are injuries to which
Bo luuiuu
can afford to submit."'

LONDON, Dec. 8.—Li I-Imir Clir.ng,
the viceroy, has telegraphed The Chron
icle's Shanghai correspondent confirm
ing the news of the litter crushing
defeat of the rebels. It is fe::re:l here
that this unexpected victory will cause
the imperial government, to overrate irs
power to suppress the rebellion. The
correspondent then gives further details
of the recent massacre, which shows
that it was a veritable carnival of blood.
He says: "The merciless horde at
tacked and set on fire several orphan
ages and an awi'ul holocaust was tlie re
sult. Terrible scenes were enac:ed oe
the roads along which the Christians
fled from the assassins. Many who be
came exhausted dropped by the roadside
and died. The course of their flight is
marked by corpses, half eaten by dogs.
Li Hung Chang has just telegraphed
that martial law has been proclaimed
throughout Manclmeria."
Forty-five hundred imperial troops
meta fprce of B,000 rebels at a point fif
teen miles from Chayoyimg. The lat
ter were very daring and had better
cavalry than the imperial forces, who
were at first compelled to move back
somewhat. The conflict which ensued
was long and stubborn. Finally there
was a spirited charge from the imperial
side. This threw the rebels into confu
sion and they began retreating, keeping
up a running fight, however. No quar
ter was given. Eleven hundred rebels
were slaughtered on the field, and those
which were captured were immediately
executed.
K* llur's Klectric Plow.
SAUK CENTHH, Minn., Dec. 8.—
Senator
Henry Keller is at work upon anew in
vention, which, if it proves a success,
will be of great value to farmers. The
scheme is to attach an electric motor to
a common breaking plow that will con
tain sufficient force to work in any kind
of soil. Storage batteries are to be ad
justed to the machine so as to keen it in
constant motion. Senator Keller has
the utmost faith in his new "help to tho
farmer," and declares that it will reduce
the cost of plowing to such a mere trifle,
and do it with such ease and rapidity,
that every farmer in the land will find
it within his means to plow with elec
tric machines.
that the new company will absorb the
Minneapolis Harvester works. The new
plant will cost between $300,0U0 and
$400,000, and the work of erecting it
will commence in the spring. Twenty
tive hundred men will be employed.
