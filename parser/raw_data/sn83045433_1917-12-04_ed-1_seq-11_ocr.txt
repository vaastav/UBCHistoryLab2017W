eslea et Peefsag.
Peeftg I ne new thing. It was
adopted nearly seventy years ago by
John 3. Forbes, of Boston Mr.
Forbes was. if not the creator, at
least the real bilder of the Michigan
Central raibead. The volume of
transpeetation which was offered tol
his read after 3r. Forbes put the ter
minal at Chicago. was so great as to
prove an breeistible temptation to
New York Mpital. Mr. Forbes ob
tained bi mpital In Doeton. This
New York eapital was Inveeted In the
bending and Operation at a railroad
whese eastern terminal was at But
eb and the western one at Chicago.
It ran &aet parallel with the Mich
iga Central, although its line was
south of Iake Erie. while the Michi-'
r ga Central was north. When the4
read was completed its managers
wee eenvinced that aempetition was
the life Of trade for railroads as well
as for other business. Competition
upon a staggering scale was main
tained. It went so far that it became
evident that It might bring both roads
to bankruptcy.
Then Mr. rorbes suggested the pool.
His plan was adopted. Competition
that was suicidal ceased and both
cempanie became prosperous. At the
the of the civil war it was necessa.y
te perfect Certain co-operation between
the searead aempanies which Invotv
ad a form af pooling. It was accepted
by the government without protest
and by the pubICe as a reasonable
tt to af.
Years later the pool- was again
adeuted In order to put an end to s
c9lled aut-threat competition which
the trunk lines had maintained for:
ame years. The plan went so far
as to allow differentials to certain of
the railroad lines running from New
York or Beehm to Chicaso and other
pots in the West. Congress. sup-:
pIemented by the declsions of the Su-I
Morine Court put an end to this method
of co-operation. Yet at the time the
law was passed there were some who
asserted that If the government regu
laed or supervised the railroads and
had authority over rates then there
was ne reason why pooling should
- t be permitted.

Stock Market Heptionafly Lack
ing in Initiative.
1y eOXON WA36.,
New York, Dec. .-Wall Street took
little interest in the stock marbet
today, TRe trend of prices was do
ward In trading that was narrow
extremely limited in volume. Prac
tically no outside trading was noticed
and the antir day's turnover amount
ed to but 39L0 shares.
The reason for the apathy was ap
parenL The street was awaiting the
assembling of the new Congress. the
President's message, to be delivered
tomorrow, and word of some deter
mination in the freight rate case, ex
'atlr at any time.
Initiative was almost wholly lack
either In buying or selling. Prices
i'..ared rather to sag than to give
a' under pressure. Industrials made
veral half-hearted displays of
g. 19th, but showed net losses at the
doming for the most part. Rails were
w-ik, most of them sustalning losses
of from 1-4 per cent to a full point
The transportation situation and
how it will be handled by Congress
formed the subject of most discussion.
Wall Street financiers freely expressed
belief that there must be legislation
for the effective working of the pro
posed pooling of railroad facilities.
Uncertainty as to how far Congress
may be depended upon to formulate
constructive legislation for the Im
mediate relief nepeded had not a little
to do with the hdiltancy to make Com
mitments.
Bethlehem Steel stocks showed de
clines of 11-2 for the common and
23-8 for the B Issue at the close. U.
SOSteel common lost but 3-4; Smelters,
114: Pullman fell 21-3; Distillers, 1-2;
tobacco products, 11-; United Cigar
Stores. 5-S, and General Motor 2 points.
Of the railroad issues at. Paul gain
