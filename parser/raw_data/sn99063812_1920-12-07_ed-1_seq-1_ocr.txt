In discussing tho phone situation
with E. T. Ludden, manager ot tho
Pacific Telephono and Telegraph
company, Mr. Ludden was found to
bo vory emphatic and much con
cerned regarding tho ability ot his
company to go on In the development
ot their telephone work In Klamath
Falls, which work Is essential to
the regaining of a normal ability
to take care ot current demands for
servlco in this city. Ho points out
that Klamath Falls has at present
78 waiting orders which the telo-
pbono company is unable to take
care of under present conditions
and relief can only como by the
heavy expenditure ot "now" capital.
It -.will require a continuous expend
iture for now plant In order to nieot
the demand for servlco In this city
and to provide jbow toll lines neces
sary to meet the rapidly growing
long distance business ot thla sec
tion. The telephone company In its re
cent application to the -public serv
lco commission ot Oregon haa plain
ly declared Its Inability to mako
theao new expenditures in the ab
senco of any earning capacity. Pres
ent revenue is barely sufficient to
pay operating expenses and loaves
no margin necessary to secure the
money to carry out tho company's
construction program.
It would appear that tho magni
tude ot thla Issue Is such as to mako
It a matter ot real public interest
aside from tho Interest that the tel
ephone company may have Itself in
tho matter. It largo sums ot "new"
money must bo bad for investment
In tho telephono properties It is ob
vious that it cannot bo secured In
tho absence of rates sufficient to
pay bare operating expenses.
The telophone company in its ap
plication to tho public serv
ice commission declared that it Is
now on a deficit basis. It declares
to the public ot Orogon that it Is
oarnlng nothing, that never in Its
history was its plant as deficient in
ability to take care of Oregon's do
mands; It declares to tho public ot
Klamath Falls and tho stato ot Oro
gon that tho only probable solution
ot Impending difficulties la tho Im
mediate planning and installation ot
heavy addition to plant. It declaros
Its absolute Inability to ralso money
to bring to Klamath Falls and spend
It until It has boon fully dotermlnod
whether or not It will bo permitted
to earn enough monoy, through
rates for servlco, to pay tho operat
ing expenses ot Its plant and leavo
something as an Inducement to In
vestment. Mr. Ludden Btated that while it is
true cortaln prices aro uppoarlng to
dccllno tho problem ot tho telephone,
company to give a proper return on
Its Investment is concerned with the
plant as It exists today. Any change
In prices for its material would only
affect subsequent additions to plant.
Mr. Ludden turthor .suggested
that the majority of tho price reces
sions seoms to be in thoso commod
ities that had risen to abnormal
holghta owing to peculiar economic
conditions; also tho greatest part ot
tho telephone expenses Is labor
approximately 73 per cent. No ono
oxpects that the prices ot labor will
bo generally reducod. As far as
tho telephone, company is concerned.
It does not antlclpato any such con
tingency.
Tho rapid growth ot tho mall Is an
Indlcatlou ot health.
The excluslxe food of the happy

simplification ot tho Income and pro
fits taxes, Independence for tho Phil
ippines, n loan to tho Armenian gov
ernment, economy In government ap
propriations and expenditures, the

tem, cold storage laws and other lawa

The president also recommended
tho rehabilitation and training ot
disabled soldiers and sailors, but he
did not Indorse the bonus plan.
Tho president did not appear be
fore congress In person but trans
mitted the messago In writing by
messenger.
Nowhere In his message did Mr.
Wjlson refer to the league of nations,
except by Inference In the opening
passages. Tho president wrote a par
agraph which might bo regarded aa
his valedictery:
'I have not so much laid before;
you a set of recommendations a I
have sought to utter a confession
ot faith; faith in which I was bred
and which it 1 my solemn purpose
to stand by until ay last tightlaa;
days. I believe this Is to be tha
faith of America, the faith of the fu
ture and ot alt .victories, which await
any natlonal"aetlon"-!n the days to
conte. whether In America or else
where" President's Wilson's message be
gan wtlh a quotation from Lincoln.
"Let us have faith that right makes
might and, in that faith let us dare
to do our duty aa wo understand It."
Tho president declared that thla
sentence, "marks for us In the plain
est manner the part we should play,
alike In the arrangement ot our do
mestic affairs and In our exercise
ot Influence upon the affairs of tno
world.
"It was this faith which prevailed
over the wicked force of Germany,"
he continued, "and this Is the time ot
all others when democracy should
prove Its purity and Its splrtual pow
er If It Is to prevail. Thero aro two
ways In which tho United States na
assist to accomplish this great ob
ject, first to ronke and enforce lawa
unquestionably Just, which will se
cure Its full right to labor and at the
same time safeguard the Integrity
ot property.
"Second, by standing for right and
Justlco as toward individual nations.
The Influence of overy nation should
be for the protection ot weaker na
tions and tho United State cannot
rotuso this rolo ot champion without
putting the stigma ot rejection upon
the great and devoted men, who
brought this government Into exist
anco and established it In the faw u
ot almost, universal opposition ani
intrigue."
