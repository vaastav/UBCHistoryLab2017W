What tho decision in regard o

to conjecture ; but it is equally useless
to disguise tho tact that a majority ol
the Canadians sympathize with them
and hope for their speedy releuse.
Such sympathy la lelt not only by
men who avowedly approve their acts
ol' rubbery an J murder, but by maii v
who, il their words may ho believed

every thing else required for the pro

nearly twice as much that i, add
