Form
Of the many recommendations we've heard ?
for our "Foot-Form" Boots probably the !
strongest and most convincing was littered by
a lady here the other day, who said: "I
wouldn't take a thousand dollars for the good
your boots have done my daughter's feet. She
has suffered from her feet all her life, been ac
tually made sick by the pain they gave her. I
have bought ready-made boots of all kinds,
and have had boots made to order, but never
accomplished any good until I got her a pair
of 'Foot Forms.' "
"Foot-Form" Boots are for sick feet. Their
very elasticity and the perfection of their fit
are proof against bunions and corns. No
?
more footaches and burnings when you wear
these Shoes.
You can wear "Foot Forms" in as stylish
styles as you wish and never sacrifice any of
their comfort. Always $3.50.

FACING THE OUTLOOK
Many Views as to What Congress
Will Do.
DISCOSSmO PRESIDENTIAL MESSAGE
Currency, Spain and Hawaii, the
Chief Topics.
PERFUNCTORY EXPRESSIONS
ator? anfl r eirres8lon* ?P'nlon by sen
deit a mo rePresentatives as to the Pre.i
fcn rZ fT ?' th'8 tlme are P^func
doiIIpH folic wing are a tew of the most
pointed expressions:
Mr. Qulgg of New York said:
"The President's recommendations are
extremely conservative, and that is also
the spirit of Corgrtss. It is not likely that
much will be done at this session beyond
the passage of the usual measures for the
support of the government. The Presi
dents suggestion about holding for gold
r.otes that have been redeemed in gold
may possibly be acted upon, but neither of
the political parties is anxious to engage
in currency legislation until it has a clear
majority in both houses, so that it can pass
the sort of complete and satisfactory bill
on which It is willing to go to the country
as the expression of its real and full sense.
As to Cuba, the President's views will in
my opinion, |>e sustained. He has acted
with such good sense so far that the whole
case should be left in his hands."
Clear on the Money (Inentlon.
Representative Henderson of Iowa said:
"On the money question he is clear, stat
ing our situation with marked intelligence,
pointing out our dangers ar.d making cer
tain recommendations that would certainly.
If adopted, prevent for the present, at
least, disasters that we have experienced
in the past. On the Cul>an question his
course has been active, intelligent, patriot
ic an 1 wise. I am glad that he has gone
so fully into the subject, as there Is much
misconception among us in this country in
regard to the efTect of recognizing belliger
ent rights, and It is evident from what he
has done that this nation could not prop
erly pursue a different course from the one
which it is now pursuing. He gives grounds
for hope that a solution may be reached
in Cuba, resulting from the earnest elTorts
of this government. 1 note with pleasure
the strong ground taken by him in favor
of the annexation of the Hawaiian Islands,
and hope that the Senate may agree with
the view taken by the President."
Representative Hull (rep.) of Iowa said:
"The recommendutlor s as to currency
reform are more moderate than I expected,
and it mav be possible for us to come to
gether in some way. Personally. I am op
posed to any action on the currency at
this time. I do not believe in the inter
national monetary congress. The result of
the last ye;ir has, to my mind, demonstrat
ed the futility of any further effort in this
line. I cordially indorse the President's
position as to the Hawaiian Islands, but
cannot agree to his suggestions as to
Cuba. Unless the war in Cuba is brought
to a speedy close I feel sure the House
of Representatives will take action. I cor
dially Indorse his suggestions for the ac
cumulation of war material and Improved
projectiles. It is not good policy for a
government to wait till war comes before
being prepared for It."
Representative Richardson (dem.) of Ten
nessee said:
"The message Is wholly disappointing to
the country. Nothing practical for finan
cial improvement is recommended. No In
crease in revenues provided, while we are
running behind nearly ten millions a
month: nothing for Cuba, but all for Spain
Cleveland s policy of if-suing bonds to main
tain gold reserve indorsed. All for gold and
the single gold standard and nothing for
bimetallism or relief of the people."
Representative Sayers (dem.) of Texas
The recommendation by the President
that w-hen any of the United States notes
shall be redeemed In gold they shall be
kept and set apart and paid out only in
exchange for gold will be, in my judgment
ir carried out. an Indirect method of re
tiring the greenbacks, and, if such policy
should prevail, it will be as fatal to the
further use of these notes as currency as
If they m d been converted Into bonds.
In such a policy I do not concur. More
0vf,r' '.ine Resident's policy should pre
vail with Congress, it will be an invita
tion to those who are opposed to the fur
ther use of the greenbacks as money to
present them for redemption in gold I
also regard that portion of the message
concerning Cuba as fatal to any action
upon the part of this government looking
to the granting of beligerent rights to the
revolutionists or to the recognition of their
government. I am heartily In favor of
granting them belligerent rights. In my
Judgment, they have fully earned such
iccognition.
Rei-renentntive llltuid'. Objection.
Representative Bland (dem.) of Missouri
the recognized free silver democratic
leader:
"The President's proposition to retire the
greenbacks, by holding them in the treas
ury except for gold deposits, means a con
traction of the currency to the amount of

form and with his expressed determination
to continue his efforts in that direction i
regret his opposition to intervention In be
half of Cuban Independence."
Cbalrmaa Cannon and Economy.
Mr. Cannon, chairman of the committee
on appropriations, said: "I am much grati
fied with that feature of the President's
message in which he says "it is a com
duty to keep the appropriation*
within the revenues of the government
and thus avoid a deficiency.' The sugges
tion is particularly timely just now i
heartily approve also of ail the President
says as to Spain and Cuba, and I think the
country is to be congratulated on having
the situation placed la jjuch* clear light."
Chairman Dlngley of Maine said: "The
message Is a practical stat;e paper wfflch
will be generally approved. The President
presents some excellent practical sugges
tions as to the currency. What the Presi
dent says relative to CiR*. will, I have no
doubt, meet the hearty kfeproval of the best
3e..tlment of the country. The President
wisely omits the usual "f-estfme or ihe de
partment reports as an dnn^essary feature
in an executive message, espt-ciaIly In these
days, when so many important Questions
come up for solution." ''
Representative Cox ef Tennessee, the
ranking democratic meftfcer of the com
mitter on banking and owrrcncy-'Tlu- mes
sage In regard to the currency. In my judg
ment. Is an utter failure. If the policy ad
vocated was carried out Into law, it could
only result In the contraction of the cur
rency. Under the arguments made by the
President, It wculd be the duty of the gov
ernment to radeem silver in gold upon the
application of the holder of stiver as read
ily as it does the United States notes. So.
if every pa.per dollar Of the government
was retired the raid could be made on the
treasury just as well with silver. In regard
to the recommendations as to banking they
are of such a character that no cua.ness
bank would dp business under such law.
True the recommendations would permit
the banks to take out circulation to the ex
tent of the par value of bonds, and ?ould
result In a small reduction of taxation on
circulation. But the circulation on bonds
would cost the banker more on account ot
the premium and would cost him more to
obtain the circulation; therefore his interest
would be to use his money and buy no
bonds." . ,.
Senator Teller, silver republican? 'I don t
believe that any legislation will be enacted
authorizing the retention of the greenbacks
in the treasury until somebody is willing to
pay gold for them. The radical advocates
of the gold standard will not be willing to
accept this suggestion, nor will the silver
men. so far as I am Informed, favor this
disposition of the financial question. It
may be that the administration will be will
ing to go no farther to meet the demands of
the so-called currency reformers, but judg
ing from the utterances of the Secretary of
jh.g Treasury, he will be willing to make
further concession. I do not believe that
the suggestion for the tying up of the
greenbacks will meet the approval of the
people, as such a course would inevitably
result tn great contraction of the currencj.
Indeed, it looks to me as If the suggestions
of the President would not be satisfactory
to any great number of people of any par
ly The President is certainly mistaken
when he says that the government Is
obliged to redeem its obligat.ons in gold.
It lias been the policy of the administration
to so redeem, but there is no compulsion on
this i>oint."
Chairman Walker's Crltleinm.
Representative Walker of Massachusetts,
chairman of the committee oil banking and
currency, said, as to the financial features
of the message: "I fear the message is not
sufficiently specific and dots not go far
enough to relieve the situation. .It does not
recommend that anything shall be done
until the revenues exceed the expenditures
of the government, which may be man>
months in the future, and Is far from im
mediate action. Secondly, the recommenda
tion that greenbacks be not paid out ex
cept for gold when once redeemed In gold,
if enacted Into law, would enable one man
with $1,<XK),000 of greenbacks demanding
gold of the treasury and then depositing the
gold in the bank for greenbacks, and re
peating the process :U? times, to retire the
whole >,'**> in the time it would take
him to oscillate between the subtreasury
In New York and l*is confederate foreign
broker. The recommend*tlo,u that banks be
required to redeem their notes in gold witn
no other provision of law. would cause
every bank in the country to surrender its
circulation, and then what agency would
keep the country on a gold basis?"
PRESENT RAILWAY SITIATIOX.
The Necessity of K*r?rtr im?r?tat?
Commerce L.t^l?lWtlon.
From the North Ameritan ftijjlevr
The interstate commerce law has proved
of little benefit. Though tfce amendment*
adopted by Congress rtnee It was passed
have been practically .unimportant, the ju
dicial interpretation It ,i baa !received has
lefl but little effective re?e*tf?lance to what
It was originally supposed 'to mean. The
people will -not toat sjlf>id'e1y ^iUlect to
these conditions. Congress will. n?t by in
action confess itself Impotent to success
fully regulate Interstate transportation, nor
will investors In railway property prove ul
timately Incapable, flf convincing the gen
eral public that no righteous purpose is
served by rendering unprofitable the Indus
try of carrying persons and property by
lall. The legislative remedies tried during
the last threa decades have been generally
based upon an assumed conllict between
the respective interests of the roads and
their patrons. Maximum rate laws, long
and short haul restrictions, not always un
productive of mildly beneficial conse
qucnces; excessive and double taxing
schemes, anti-association and anti-pooling
legislation, the Injustice and positively det
rimental effects of which are now recogniz
ed by all wise publicists?have all had their
origin in this supposed antagonism. They
have also been universally based upon the
theory that particular railway charges can
be. and are likely to b?, excessive and ex
tortionate In themselves. As the only rea
sonable criterion of charges is the relation
between the cost of supplying and operat
ing railway facilities and the aggregate
levenue received from disposing of the ser
vices they are created to perform, there
can be no just approval or disapproval of a
particular charge except In consideration of
its relation to other charges. As Injustice
cannot be predicated of any rate except
with regard to Its relation to others. It Is
fortunate that the equitable adjustment of
these relations Is the fundamental economic
and social problem; or. In other words,
that the exact amount charged In any case
Is of but little Importance, while Its rela
tion to oth'er charges Is of paramount con
sideration In the conduct ot the business
affected.
Admitting the truth of this, the question
l-.aturally occurs, "How can permanent
uniformity be maintained?"
Permanent uniformity cannot be main
tained unless there be established some
system which comprehends a substantial
Incentive for adherence to agreements once
reached, and the substitution of a thorough
understanding among railway managers of
the genuine Identity of the Interests of the
corporations they serve, for the superficial
spirit of tlvaliy and conflict now too fre
quently prevalent. WhHe the ownership of
the railway system continues to be vested
in a large number of legally separate cor
porations, this harmonization of Interests
can be achieved In a satisfactory degree
only by the division of all traffic for which
two or more routes are, from a commercial
standpoint, practically available, among
the carriers operating such routes In stipu
lated proportions according to contracts,
the observance of which may be enforced
by judicial process. Such division may, in
most cases, be accomplished either by the
physical division of business or by the pay
ment of money balances! supposed to rep
resent the profits on the 'traffic carried
in excess of the agreed-proportions to the
line or lines not receiving* their full share.
In either case there exists what in common
parlance is termed a "pAoL''

to complete their eduction. Both have

The first appearance of the little Japanese
lady on the Yale campus almost created a
panic among the undergraduates, who
uodged behind corners to get a glimpse of
the latest advent of the new woman. She
wears her native costume, which the stu
dents describe as like a pair of black pa

to her head and Is very glossy- She has
bright red cheeks and is short In stature.
Her manners are refined and pleasant.

BOYS' REFORMSCHOOL
Report of President Clay of the Board
of Trustees.
SDPT. SHALLENBERGER'S ACCOUNT
Need of Inspection After Discharge
of Prisoners.
CAUSES OF DETENTION
Col. Cecil Clay, president or the board or
trustees of the reform school of the Dis
trict. has made his annual report to At
torney General McKenna for the fiscal year
18U7. At the beginning of the last fiscal
year there were in the school 218 boys;
there were received during the year 12T>, a
total of .'(44, as against 328 for the previous
year. Seventy-six of those received were
committed by the Police Court and t! by the
Supreme Court of the District of Colum
bia; 31 by United States courts outside or
the District and 13 by the president or the
board of trustees.
There were discharged during the year
by order of the trustees, 22 by expiration of
sentence (United States courts), 3 by order
of court and t> escaped and are still absent,
leaving in the school June 3U, 1W7. 224.
There were no deaths during the year, and
the grneral health ? t the inmates was ana
is good.
The air.ount appropriated for salaries Wir
the present fiscal year was $lii,242. The
amount^ of the present estimate for salaries
is {17,172. The estimates for the construc
tion of an assembly hall at a cost of
$t>,750, and for the construction and equip
ment or a dairy to cost |3.33o, including
stock and appliances, are the same as those
submitted for the present fiscal year, and
the same reasons which were given for
them then hold good now.
There has been turned into the treasury
to the credit or the United States ana the
District or Columbia, jointly, tiie sum or
12.43ft, derived as follows: From the paper
box factory, sales from green houses,
sales of surplus farm produots.
ISS.75. and from miscellaneous sources,
$248.01.
In last year's report It was stated .that
"the board has always been of the opinion
that such part or the boys' time as Is given
to work oilier than in the school room
should be devoted, as tar as possible, t?j re
ceiving instruction In such handicrafts and
manual training as would go to make them
seif-supporting aTter leaving the school
rather than the performance or such labor
on the farm or in the shops as would re
sult merely in the production of a smill
amount of money to be turned into the
government's treasury without giving them
any ustful knowledge." Acting u[>on this
Idea, the second floor of the bakery build
ing has been equipped with the necessary
benches, tools and appliances for instruct
ing a limited number of boys In the Sloyd
system of manual training, the result of
which instruction has been so satisfactory
as to encourage the board to still further
extend it.
Ticket of i.r#\e
The board repeats what was said m the
last report, that discharges from the school
should be limited and not absolute: that
Congress should be asked to provide by leg
islation for such control by the board or
trustees of the boys after discharge as will
enable it to reclaim and return to the
school any boy who. by his bad conduct,
shows himself amenable to recommitment.
As long ago as the first session of the Fif
tieth Congress, in 18t>s, Congress was ask
ed to legislate in this direction, and a bill
was favorably reported in the House at
that session, but not passed. The board
thinks "that Congress should, at its next '
session, be asked to pass a bill giving the
board authority over the boys after dis
charge."
A .great deal has been done during the
year in the way of permanent improve
ments and repairs. The bakehouse, the
building of which was reported last year,
has been entirely completed and equipped
with modern improvements. The entire
system of steam heating has been remod
eled, and new pipes from the boiler house
to the different buildings have been laid in
brick trenches, which give protection as
well as afford ready access for repair.
Many repairs and improvements have been
made in the main building, including new
concrete floors and steel ceilings in the
kitchens, a new auxiliary cooking range,
and new water-supply pipes to replace the
old ones and to give better service in differ
ent parts of the bulli ng; school rooms, dor
mitories, and the boys' dining room, in
cluding the floors, have been painted.
Necessary repairs have been made to the
barn, boiler house, workshops, greenhouses,
etc. A large amount of new fencing has
been erected and the old repaired. Some
sewers have been enlarged and extended:
the roadways have been resurfaced, rolled
and drained. In all of this work the boys
have been employed wherever their ser
vices could be made available.
The rei>ort of the treasurer of the school,
submitted as an exhibit to this report,
shows in detail the receipts and expendi
tures during the year. There are also sub
mitted as exhibits the reports of the super
intendent and of the attending physician.
The board suggests, in view of the rela
tion which the Department of Justice bears
to the government's system of caring for
United States prisoners, and the similar
positions to the department and the Dis
trict of Columbia occupied by the United
States Jail, District of Columbia, and the
reform school, District of Columbia, that
In appropriating for the latter the words
"all under the direction of the Attorney
General" be substituted for "all under the
control of the Commissioners," as was done
In the case of the former, the Commission
ers having expressed themselves as favora
ble to this change.
Report of Superintendent Shullenber
**r.
The annual report of G. A. Shallenberger,
superintendent, follows that of Colonei
Clay. He says that the total number of
boys received since the opening of the
school Is 2,262. The total number of deaths
has been twelve, the rate of mortality be
ing five-eighths of 1 per cent. Of the 12(1
boys committed during the past year sev
enty-six were sent by the Police Court of
the District; six by the District Supreme
Court; thirty-one by United States district
courts, and thirteen by the president of the
board of trustees.
The average age of boys received during
the year was thirteen years and nine
months. The everage time served by boys
discharged during the year was two years
and one month.
Of the 120 lioys received In the school,
sixty-six had kept bad company and used
tobacco, fifty-three had bad or doubtrul
records and seven had fairly good homo
records; eighty had not been employed.
lv! Vi* h?d worked some and ten had
attended school regularly.
The causes of commitment of the 12G
boys were as follov.s. Assault. 4; burglary,
o, breaking into post office, 1; carrying con
cealed weapons. 1; depredation of private
property. 2; embezzlement United States
mall. 4: false pretense, 1; horse theft 4

larceny from
' robbery. 2; violation of
TTnl!^ St , 8 postHl 'awB' 8; violation of
United Statee revenue laws, 2: vajrrancy 3
The superintendent siys:
"We have received and discharged a
larger number of boys than ever before
in a single year. A small number of these
had come back to us the second Ume. and
a still smaller number under a third com
mitment. There Is nothing, however, dis
coursing in the facts as stated, as the
rew thus received were young In years
when first committed. A long experience
has given proof that almost every example
of this kind has in the end produced the
most satisfactory results. Considering
these special cases, together with the more
persistently incorrigible among all others.
It Is plainly evident that under a reason
able and equitable discipline they also
by a longer service, did finally secure the
necessary promotions, and consequently
their honcrabie discharge. Tracing the
lives of many of these boys, after years
of trial and a peisonal contact with the
outer world, we have the most gratifying
evidence that generally they are doing
well, while some of them are not only sus
taining themselves, but helping others,
and are thus making a creditable and man
ly record among their fellows.

III* (?HUH'.
From the New Tork Tribune.
Th< y had tramped long through fields and
woodland*. beating every bush and throw
ing stones Into every thicket. The less en
ergetic of them had also insisted on the
dogs doing their full share of the work, and
had often exclaimed. "Sic 'em. Tige! go In.
Fanny!" and such things. Four of the ar
' dent sportsmen, who constituted a majority
I of the party, had just emerged from a piece
I of dense tlmlier land when u whizz and a
j burr were heard, and a pair of l.lg pheas
| ants took wing from under their very feet.
J P.ang, bang, hangedy-bang-bang! went the
guns, and one of the birds came down with
a thud The other, however, continued Its
flight until lost to view.
"He's mine!" ejaculated one of the gun
ners as he started for the dead bird.
"No. he's mine; I hit him.' exclaimed an
other.
"Not much: he's my bird.'' declared a
third. "1 had a dead cinch on him.''
The fourth man In the party did not
speak until he had carefully and method
ically reloaded his gun. He then gazed
quietly at his companions for a moment or
two. and finally said:
"Boys, you are all wrong. It was I who
killed <"ock Robin with my little gun. and
he belongs to me."
"How do you make that out?" exclaimed
I the other men in a bunch.
"Easy enough." repli.nl the quiet man:
"the pheasant was killed with monogram
shot, and 1 am the only one in the party
who uses that kind of shot."
With that the quiet man took the bird
from the man who had reached It tirst, and
carefully stowed It away In the capacious
pocket of his hunting jacket.
"Monogram shot!" echoed the rest of the
men ir. one voice. "What in the deuce is
monogram shot?"
"H.imph! I thought that you youngster#
had never heard of that," said the veteran:
"it is simply shot on which my monogram
is imprinted."
"Will you kindly permit us to see some of
this wonderful shot?" asked one of the par
ty sarcastically.
"Certainly, it will afford me great pleas
ure." declared the veteran, as he plunged
his hand down into his pocket and fished
out a little leaden pellet. This was exam
ined by all the men In turn. and. sure
enough, the letter# forming the claimant'*
monogram were found to be legibly stamped
upon it.
The men were plainly puzzled, but. not
wishing to show their Ignorance of the sup
posed modern kind of ammunition, they
dropped the matter for the time being.
That night the owner of the monogram shot
left for his home in the city, taking with
him the pheasant and most of the other
game which had been killed during the day.
The rest of the party had gathered around
a blazing hot tire in the little hotel, when
one of them suddenly remarked:
"Say. Ixiys. I am not onto that monogram
shot racket yet. That fellow has gone
home and taken alcout all the game with
him on the ground that it was kMled with
monogram shot. Now. how do we know
that t was killed with his blessed old mon
ogram shot?"
"Why. he showed us one of 'be shot."
innocently spoke up the youngest of the
party.
"Yes. but that did not prove that all the
birds he Claimed to have dropped were
killed with monogram shot. We didn't pick
any of the shot out oi the birds."
"Well, here is one of the cartridges that
he left behind him." said a third man;
"let's break it open and examine it."
The shot was soon damped out of the
cartridge and each grain carefully scru
tinized by the men. It Is needless to re
mark. as the lecturer says (and then talks
half an hour on the subject), that not a
sign of the. man's monogram was discov
ered on any of the shot.
"We've been buncoed!" exclaimed one of
the men In a disgusted tone of voice; "we
have been undone!"
"We have." echoed the other men in
chorus?"and by means of monogram shot."
"But for heaven's sake, let us keep quiet
about It." said one of the party, "because,
if this story gets out, we will l?- the laugh
ing stock of the town when we get home."
All the men solemnly swore to keep mum,
but the story was too good, anil It had to
come out to prevent other young and inex
perienced sportsmen from going to shop
keepers and Importuning them for mono
gram shot.
MONTANA'S IMMEMSli KOIATAIV.
Anaconda U to Hurt the l.argenl l(
the World.
From the New York Time*.
The Anaconda Mining Company has ac
quired rights to all the water In Hearst
gulch ar.d lake, at Anaconda, Mont., which
are fed by the melting snews that exist
there during the entire year. This lake
lies up agiin&t Mount Haggln, 2.1KW feet
above the level of the street in front of the
Montana Hotel. The company will raise
the nank about l^ake Hearst so as to make
it a reservoir with a capacity of nearly a
billion gallons, and giving a dally flow of
four million gallons down a slope of 3,<W0
feet Into tbe city.
A steel pipe lipe will carry this water
down six miles to Anr.cor.di, where an
other immense reservoir will l?e built to
receive it- This reservoir will be 32U feet
higher than the business center of the
city and a quarter of u mile long. Its
shore line will be Irregular, lying igalr.st
the hills, and it will be a beautiful shi e:
of water. As a further means of adding
to tbe beauty of the spot, the tapply main
from I.ake Hearst will terminate In a
fountain In the center of the reservoir.
Only a portion of the enormous pressure
will be L'sed, but a solid Jet of water over
three inches In diameter will be thrown
22U feet vertically in the air. while arout.d
the base of the fountain will be a fill ge
of spray, consisting of rows of Jets rising
to varying heights and at different urgles.
The fountain, when completed, will be.
without exception, the largest in the world
The Jets will rise from a massive base of
rough masonry.
The embankment which will form the
reservoir will consist of tough, tenacious
clay, excavated from a larg? deposit in
the vicinity. over 170 feet thick at the
base and twelve feet wide at the top.
Lengthwise through the center will lie a
so'ld wall of concrete masonry. No pipe
will be allowed to pass through the em
bankment. but in the solid rock beyond Its
end a valve well will be excavuted and
connected. Ever}- precaution that can be
suggested will he taken In building the
reservoir, and the valves flowing from it
will be regulated and controlled by elec
tricity. When completed ttiore will not
be a point In the city whero water can
not be thrown ever one hundred feet verti
cally by direct pressure.
