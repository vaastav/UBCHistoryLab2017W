common law are condemned, and the
President denounces many methods
used by promoters of trusts.
Reciprocity He advocates the prin
ciple of reciprocal trade relations, but
makes no specific recommendations.
Ho advocates a reduction of sugar
duties from Cuba: in return for the ad-
mission ot commodities from tho Uni -
ted States at lower rates of duties than the act expires In May.

PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE TO CONGRESS
Washington, Dec. 3.
but depressing weather did
ing to the capitol to hear the first state paper from Presi
dent Roosevelt read. Senators and representatives gath
ered early. Proceedings opened sharply at noon. Major
Pruden, assistant secretary to the President, appeared
and presented to the chairman of the senate the message,
which was immediately read. The senators listened to
every word with closest attention. A somewhat similar
scene was enacted in the house. Major Pruden handed a
cop3' of the message to Speaker Henderson, and said: "A
message from the President."
Seldom has a President's message been received with
more favor. The keenest interest was manifested. Erery
member sat and listened in a manner very different from
the usual perfunctory style. There was occasional ap
plause, the liveliest being when the clerk read "The Amer
ican people are s'ow to wrath, but when their wrath, is
once kindled it burns like consuming fire." After the
Lreadingbctli houses adjourneji outof respect to the mem
ory of McKinley.
The message was elaborate. President Roosevelt,
after announcing the death of President McKinley, is par
ticularly vigorous in denunciation of anarchistic tenden
cies; thinks the tariff should not be meddled with at the
present time, and looks upon the prosperity of the country
as a permanent condition. The President, in a measure,
upholds trusts, and thinks if people understood them bet
ter they would not be so readily denounced. He feels that
the government should prevent unfair usage of great cor
porate fortunes by publicly examining and reporting upon
the condition of the big financial, industrial and commer
cial organizations of the country. He believes that while
the rich may be growing in wealth the poor man is better
off, the average American being more prosperous today
than ever before in the history of the country. The Presi
dent favors improving arid
In aiding this work the government should go "slowly and
only help those states that are willing to .help themselves.
He thinks the navy should'be built up steadily;vthat the
army should not be increased. He favors prosecuting
brigandage in the Philippines; has a good word for the
forthcoming St. Louis exposition. He thinks that no
country in the world desires peace so much as the United
States. rf He is silent on admitting territories to statehood.
MURDERER HANGED--MISS STONE.
Washington, Dec. 3. Just before'Gliarles Brown was
hung this morning for the murder of Washington Hunter,
the Reverend Mr. Desslinger was invited into his cell to
give the condemned man spiritual advice. Brown, 'think;
ing he saw a chance to escape, picked up an iron bar 'con
cealed in his cell and swatted.the clergyman over the head,
ihijckinghim senseless. Then he walked out of the un
locked door into the corridor and into, the yard. He tried
to scale the wall, butThe was discovered by the jailors, who
with guns went for him and made him surrender. - He was
taken back to his cell and an hour Jater was legally executed.

TRUSTS
JRl liiiliiiiinii
1 iil'iiwuiwiwii
AM not an alarmist on
the subject of trusts,
but I think the public is
entitled to security in
the matter of equal rates
of transportation. These
combinations are. enti
TO CLOSE THE FIELD AGAINST HIM.
I think the public has no general grievance against the railroad
companies in the way of rates except as rate cutting works discrim
ination. This is the most common cause of irritation and the most
fruitful source of agitation in favor of government ownership. I
presume it is also the source of most of the railror.d managers' trou
bles. What is wanted in the interest of honest railroad management,
as well as of the public, is A SYSTEM OF OPEN, STABLE,
UNIFORM RATES, which all parties can count on with some
senso of security. The broadminded railroad managers must work
out this problem.
THE TRUSTS MUST NOT HAVE SPECIAL FAVORS AT THE
HANDS OF THE TRANSPORTATION COMPANIES. THE INTER
STATE COMMERCE LAW DOES NOT 'EFFECTUALLY PREVENT
DISCRIMINATION, BUT OUGHT TO BE MADE TO DO'SO.
I favor such an amendment of the interstate commerce act as
will more, fully carry out the prohibition of discrimination in rate
making and any modification of tariff schedules that may be required
to prevent their affording a shelter to monopoly.
Some Subjects for
Congressional Action.
Washington, Dec. 3 The main sub
jects of probable legislative action dur
ing this sitting of congress are gener
ally knewn. Ihe trusts, internal rev
enue reduction, river and b arbor im
provement, construction of public
buildings, pensions, revision of the
currency and banking laws, irrigation,
insular affairs and labor legislation will
occupy a great deal of attention.
Three other subjrets will also be
urged upon the notice of congress
provision for an isthmian canal, subsi
dies for the American merchant ma
rine and the construction by the gov
ernment or authorization for private
laying of a Pacific cable.
Th canal question will certainly
prove a long and probably bitter fieh't.
The same opposition that has met the
efforts made' in the past to build an
iuter-oceanic canal will andoubtedly be
actively afwork this session.
The demand for a Pacific cable prob
ably cannot longer be ignored. Opin
ion was divided in the, last congress
upon wKether the government should
Tbuild and own the. cable or .whether a
private corporation should be author;
ized to land it. This difference in
opinion resulted in failure to act. Ha
waii nnd'the Philippines are demand
ing the cable, and the mercantile in
terests of the country will probably
bring pressure to bear upon congress
sufficient to force action.

While there is a very general sent!-
Lment Infavor of reciprocity, there areJ
a variety 01 opinions as to now lar if

The trouble will be to reach a basis of
agreement.
One or more bills will be Introduced
in the house, to supplement and
strengthen the act of March 14, 1900,
known as the gold standard law. Mr.
Overstreet of Indiana, who is regarded
as the author of the gold standard law,
and a member of the Banking com
mittee, has prep red a bill", tuo pur
pose of which is to require the secre
tary of tho treasury to exchange on
demand gold coin for standard silver
dollars.
The question whether or not the war
revenue taxes should be reduced may
lead to a lively.flght among the Re
publican members of the house Ways
and Means committee. Chairman
Payne favors a material reduction and
intends to introduce a bill providing
for the cut. On the other hand, an
important faction of the committee,
led by such influential members as
Kepresentstive Hopkins of Illinois and
Representative Tnwney of Minnesota
are opposed to any depletion of fie
revenue until all the government's
financial necessities are asserted ai.d

The recent election of former- Presi
dent Grover Cleveland to be a trustee
of Princeton university will probably
result In the university and Its friends
seeing much more of Mr. Cleveland
than It has for some years. Of late Mr.
Cleveland has shunned social Ufe. The
functions of the university, which Mrs.
Cleveland attends with an amiable reg
ularity, have been unknown to him.
The boards of the university publica
tions have always extended to him In
vitations to attend their annual ban
quets, but, as a rule, he has politely
sent bis regrets. Nor, - unlike other
prominent cltzens of Princeton, has he
seen fit to be present at the gatherings
of such literary organizations as the
Monday Night club or the FortnlghUy
club. All this, however, will probably
be changed now.
Since the death of Benjamin Harrison
Mr. Cleveland has been the only Uvlng
ex-president of the United States. His
life, however. Is as unlike mat led by
Mr. Harrison as Is possible to Imagine.
While the latter, even up to the time of
his death, was a very busy man, things
are different with Mr. Cleveland. He'
goes from home but little, unless he hat
one'of his famous fishing trips on,b8d
Then he has only very close and IiaV
mate frlend3 for companions. In fact,
his days may be said to be spent In the
strictest retirement. He has bidden
farewell to the cares of public life.
Mr. Cleveland's home" is' on a corner
ot Bayard lane, a block from the
Princeton Inn and Nassau street.
Across the broad, tree lined street la
the temporary home of Dr. Henry Van
Dyke, the preacher-author. On an
other corner la the house occupied by
Professor W. P. Scott. In allttle house
next to that of Mr. Cleveland lives Pro
fessor A. Gnyot Cameron.

deed, there are many much more sump
tuously appointed homes In Princeton.
The Interior, howe-ver, is beautifully
furnished.
The great part of the ex-presldenfa
time Is spent In reading. Best liked by
him are books and articles on public
questions, and he devours nearly every
thing written along this line. Then
come books on modern history. As a
result or nis literary tastes he Is popu
lar with the professors of Princeton,
especially those who are iJterBjfejj-Jn"
practical questions. y
Thereare nfany daysTuat Mr. Cleve

Ic the life outdoors that appeals to him
most.of all. He attires himself In cori

der 'be starts forth from his home as
early at 8 o'clock In the morning. He
makes his way to his farm of sixty
acres .at Bocky Hill, and. there he
spends the day.
Besides a trustee of Princeton. Mr.
Cleveland Is a member of the faculty
of the university, or. hither, an honor
ary member. Once e. year he give two
lectures before the entire university
and its friends upon matters connect
ed with public affairs., The chair for
this lectureship was established through
the generosity of Henry Stafford Lit
tle of the Class of 1844.

Princeton, the crowd of expectant
students waiting before the telegraph
office at once forms into line, and a
parade la started with the significant
cry. "On to Cleveland's!"
The ever Increasing throng hastens
down Nassau street, turns Into Bayard
lane and lc another moment has Invad
ed the Cleveland premises. If be Is at
home, Mr. Cleveland at once greets
them without any formality, makes a
few timely and appropriate remarks
and then bids tbem good evening amid
cheers which show plainly enough that
in the hearts of the Princeton boys
there Is many a warm spot for the
man who not so long ago presided over
the destinies of the country.
