Emperor William has published his
game record, which covers 25 years.
It includes 1,275 stags, 1,002 red deer,
C80 roebucks, 2.189 wild pigs and nearly
30.000 hares and birds. The imperial
slaughter house has distanced all others
in Europe.
At the recent election in Salt Lak
City, where women have the same
rights of suffrage as men, all the women
candidates for office were defeated, and
defeated badly. They were slaughtered
by the votes of their own sex, who, it
seems, were unwilling to lift any of
their number to official preeminence.
Four men were killed in an attempt
to settle an old feud in Louisiana the
other day. That's generally the waj
with feuds. Other things may be set
tled with good results all around. But
the minute an attempt is made tosettle
a feud somebody is almost sure to get
killed or hurt, and then, when the
smoke clears away, it is found that the
feud is still unsettled. The best thing
to do with a feud is just to let it alone.
The old gold-brick game has just been
played in Cleveland, only with varia
tions adapted to the times. A saloon
keeper of that enterprising city was in
duced to part with $12,000 of his good
money for 67 pounds of brass filings
and sand, palmed off on the poor fellow
as a bag of Klondike clean-up. A fel
low saloon keeper who played the part
of decoy duck is In jail, but the old
miners skipped.
The Thanksgiving proclamtion of the
governor of Alaska is a unique paper.
Here it is: "On account of the wonder
ful discoveries of gold upon the Eton
dike we have been brought prominently
before the public, and many who have
decried Alaska as good for nothing now
are admitting that it has wonderful
possibilities. For this turn in the tide
of opinion let us give thanks. While the
cattle uponlthe hills are the Almighty's,
the gold, copper and oonl in the moun
tains and the fish in the sea are His
also."
The utter failure to find any traces
of Prof. Andree and his balloon can
occasion no rational surprise. The
path of arctic exploration by land and
water, or snow and ice, rather, is some
what definite, and a searching party
would know where to go, but searching
for a traveler whose route was aerial is
like trying to follow the sky tracks
made by the wings of a bird. The scien
tists who encouraged an expedition so
in conflict with common sense, and
there were some such, would do well to
recognize the limitations of human pos
sibility. No one who has kept track of the de
velopments in the Klondike region will
be surprised at the news that a famine
ds imminent at Dawson City. All
through the fall men continued to
flock into that district, relying upon the
transportation companies to bring in
supplies of provisions for the winter.
They were warned by experienced Alas
kans against the danger that threat
ened them, but very few heeded the
warning. The result is that starvation
threatens every maoan the Klondike re
gion who failed to bring with him six
months' supplies.
Two hundred and seventy-five years
ngo In November, in the year following
the landing of the Pilgrims at Ply
mouth, Gov. Bradford appointed the
first Thanksgiving. It lasted three
days, for one day was not sufficient for
the expression of gratitude and the con
sumption of wild turkeys brought in
by the hunters. Such was the first
Thanksgiving, and from that day to
this it has gradually extended all over
the country, and its national signifi
cance Is indelibly connected with the
name of Absaham Lincoln and the close
of the civil war. It Is a patriotic and
Christian festival.
The rapidity with which a wild ani
mal may be exterminated can be judged
from the fact that the Smithsonian in
stitution has recently tried in vain to
obtain a living specimen of the wild, or
passenger, pigeon which was formerly
found in this country in countless mil
lions. After theoffer of a liberal reward
and much correspondence it ha been
concluded that the American wild pi
geon is extinct. The seals are going just
as fast This year's catch in the North
Pacific ia little more than "half that of
Ipst season. Three or four years more
will wipe out the seals unless their
slaughter is stopped or regulated.
Venezuela is certainly intent upon
.naking the most of its natural re
sources. Within the last few weeks val
uable concessions have been made to
American capitalists to work mines,
asphalt deposits and lumber tracts, and
if this sort of thing continues it will not
be long before Americans will virtually
control the country. Such a result
would undoubtedly be the very best
thing that could possibly happen to the
Venezuelans. They are, unfortunately
for them, not possessed of sufficient en
terprise make the most of their en
dowments, and Yankee hustlers are

DIVERSITY OF OPINION.
How the President's Message
Strikes Different Persons.
Republican Generally Pleased wltb. the
Doenmant and Enthusiastic In Its Fralao
Democrats, on the Other Hand,
Consider Its Weak Instrument.
Washington, Dec. 7. Representa
tive Dolliver (rep.) of Iowa, said:
The president's message is a clear and con
servative statement ot the national situation.
It will meet the general popular approval. As
to the currency question, the president's omis
sion to urge in detail the most radical reforms
proposed by Secretary Gage, indicates that he
will exercise a good deal or charity toward con
gress, if that body should fail to get together
on the question
Representative Grosvenor (rep.) ot
Ohio, said:
The message is an especially able, clear and
satisfactory document all the way through.
The currency discussion will challenge close
examination, and in the end will be found to be
wise and beneilciaL The Cuba section is frank,
generally, and patriotic.
Representative Hitt (rep.) of Illinois,
chairman of the committee on foreign
affairs:
The message shows that the president has
promptly and effectively acted on the Cuban
question in fulfillment of the sentiments he
had previously expressed on the Cuban strug
gle for liberty and the just expectations of the
country. He has pressed upon the attention oC
the Spanish government the injuries our busi
ness interests are suffering, the imprisonment
of American citizens, the barbaric warfare un
der VVeyler and the need of change in the mode
of government in Cuba. The result has been
the release ot every imprisoned American, the
removal and disgrace of VVeyler, the end ot
the concentration and starvation policy and the
presentation of a system of self-government
largely based on that of Canada. When our
suggestions have thus all been accepted and
ore being carried out in apparent good faith,
which is shown by the opposition in Spain, he
wisely thinks that good faith on our part re
quires that we let the measure we ourselves
suggested be tried, at least until we can see
whether the Cubans themselves will be satis
fied. The situation is vastly different from
that of a year ago.
Representative Walker (rep.).of Mass
achusetts, chairman of the committee
on banking and currency, said, as to
the financial features of the message:
I fear the message is not sufficiently specific
and does not go far enough to relieve the situa
tion. It does not recommend anything shall be
done until the revenues exceed the expendi
tures of the government, which may be many
months in the future, and is far from immedi
ate action. Secondly, the recommendation that
greenbacks be not paid out except for gold
when once redeemed in gold, if enacted into
law, would enable one man with H.0U0.0U0
of greenbacks demanding gold of the treasury
aud then depositing the gold in the bank for
greenbacks, and repeating the process 346 times
to retire the whole 348,OUO,U0U in the time it
would take him to oscillate between the sub
treasury in New York and his confederate for
eign broker. The recommendation that banks
be required to redeem their notes in gold with
no other provision of law would cause every
bank in the country to surrender its circula
tion, and then what agency would keep the
country on a gold basis?
Representative Henderson (rep.), of
Iowa:
I am pleased with tha president's message,
because it meets clearly and squarely every
vital and pressing question. On the money
question he is clear, stating our situation with
marked intelligence, pointing out our dangers
and making certain recommendations that
would certainly, if adopted, prevent for the
present at least, disasters that we have expe
rienced in the past. On the Cuban question his
course has been active, intelligent, patriotie
and wise.
Representative Hull (rep.), of Iowa,
chairman of the committee on military
affairs:
The recommendations as to currency reform
are more moderate than I expected, and it may
be possible for us to come together in some
way. Personally, I am opposed to any action
on the currency at this time. I do not believe
in the international monetary congress. The
result of the lait year has to my mind demon
strated the futility of any further effort in tliis
line. I cordially indorse the president's posi
tion as to the Hawaiian islands, but cannot
agree to his suggestion as to Cuba,
Representative Sayers (dem.) of
Texas:
The recommendation by the president that
when any of the United States notes shall be
redeemed in gold they shall be kept and set
apart and paid out only in exchange for gold
will be, in my judgment, if carried out, an in
direct method of retiring the greenbacks; and
if such policy should prevail, it will be as fata
to the further use of these notes as currency as
it they had been converted into bonds. In such a
policy I do not concur. I also regard that por
tion of the message concerning Cuba as fatal to
any action on the part of this government
looking to the granting of belligerency rights
to the revolutionists.
Representative Bland (dem.), of. Mis
souri, the recognized free silver demo
cratic leader:
The president's proposition to retire the
greenbacks by holding them in the 'treasury,
except for gold dejiosits, means a contraction
of the currency to the amount of the greenbacks
so impounded. His statement of the situation
as to international bimetallism will not be ac
cepted in earnest by unybody. There are few
serious international bimetallists, but among
them I suppose the president may be classed as
one. The message on all subjects sounds apol
ogetic and like an affidavit for continuance.
Representative Champ Clark (dem.),
of Missouri, a member of the commit
tee on foreign affairs:
The message will lie a great campaign docu
ment for the democrats. If the recommenda
tions therein contained are adopted by the re
publicans, the democrats ought to win in 1898
and 1900 "hands down."
Representative Cox (dem.), of Ten
nessee, the ranking democratic mem
ber of the committee on banking and
currency:
The message in relation to the currency in
my judgment is an utter failure. If the policy
advocated was carried out into law. it could
only result in the contraction of the cur
rency. Under the arguments made by
the president it would be the duty
of the government to redeem silver in
gold on the application of the holder
of silver as readily as it does the United
States notes. So, if every paper dollar of the
government were retired, the raid could be
made on the treasury just as well with silver.
In regard to the recommendations as to bank
ing, they are of such a character that no bank
would do business under law.
