Tlie movement in favor of 2-cent beer
is cheeky. According to late analysis
this popular beverage contains cocculus

By the time Great Britain shall have
spent" her hundred million dollars on

It is to be hoped that the striking
employes of the Lehigh road have not,
as reported, determined upon the use
of dynamite for the purpose of destroy
ing the property of the company. Such
a course would alienate many who now
warmly approve of tlieir cause. Dy
namite is the weapon of cowards, not
of brave men, and inflicts far more
injury upon the innocent than upon the
guilty.
Tho men of intelligence who are in
the Lehigh strike have probably no
ticed that, whatever else has happened
In recent labor wars, the final result
has been decided by public opinion.
The acts of violence reported have a
very bad effect. There has been more
public sympathy than usual in railroad
cases for the Lehigh strikers, and they
6hould know that, if they are not strong
enough to win without stoning non
union Jien and causing tho troops to
come out. they will not win at all.
lblic opinion sustains unqualifiedly
the employment of the forces of the
state when necessary to keep the peace
or to restore order. The words used
are unimportant—the facts count. Be
fore labor issues triumphant from its
wars its victories must be of peace.

A New Way to Gntn nn Old End.
An unprincipled scamp recently play
ed a game Lpon a Washington restaur
nritour that for originality and effcctive
rtss lias not been matched lu any of tlie
tiiiie-honored stories of Beau Hickman
or other "caters of dinners, you foot
tho bills." He was a well dressed,
gOLllemanly appearing person—any oth
er would not have secured much atten
tion in tlie cafe which ho worked—and
he crdered a dinner that proclaimed
liiir an epicure, if a scoundrel. He
eonnrenced by tipping the waiter liber
ally, which alone would proclaim him
cue accustomed to secure the best of
attention, and as for wines, lie would
have none but the best vintages, which
lie picked with the taste of connois
seur. The dinner was prepared to the
king's taste, anil appeared to please liim
until the last course. At tliat point he
uttered an exclamation of horror, and
beckoned frantically to the waiter. That
functionary not bring sufficient to vent
Ills wrath upon, he summoned the head
waiter, and eventually the proprietor.
Then he pointed out the cause of tlie
trouble- ', dead fly in the dessert.
"Words could not express his well
feigned disgust, or the regret of the pro
prietor at this unfortunate occurrence.
The cook was railed up and "roasted!'
more effectually than he ever did his
meats, nnd 1lie restauranteur offered
every amend in bis power. But the
guest professed to be almost overcome
with nausea, and eoultl not. eat any
more—he had proliibly had all lie want
ed. Of course tin proprietor could not
think of charging for such an unfortu
nate meal, and was only too thankful
that the matter should escajK! the at
tention of his other guests. But when
the disgusted guest had gone, a bystand
er. who had watched the occurrence,
remarked to the proprietor: "Why,
didn't, you see him put that lly in tJn
dessert?" And the subsequent conver
sation was unfit for publication.—Wash,

A Uantly Ejcbrovr.
Two men were discussing the political
situation in a Michigan avenue saloon
the other evening, when one of theiu
suddenly fired up and exclaimed:
"Look out! Don't talk that way to
me!"
"Can't you bo talked to?" mildly in
quired the other.
"Xot that way. The man wlio inti
mates that I'm a liar is sure to get
hurt!" ...
"Did I seem to intimate?"
"Yes. you did!"
"I didn't know it. You might have
been lying, but I did not think so.
If I happened to think you was a liar
when you wasn't I beg to bo excused.
I don't, want to look upon any one
as a liar unless he is lying. If you
say you were telling tho truth, then,
of course.. you could not have been
lying. I don't even suspect you of lying
when you say you wasn't lying."
"Well, you be a little careful after
this, if you don't want your eyebrows
knocked off!" growled the lighter, who
wasn't entirely satisfied with the apol
ogy.
"Whieh eyebrow?" softly Inquired tlie
apologist.
"The left one, and I'm a good mind to
do it now!" shouted the lighter, as he
put up his hands.
"Don't go to the trouble. You might
strain yourself, please. Here, take it!
Sony to have hurt your feelings, but
I didn't mean to. Oood-night!"
And he walked out. leaving his left
evebrow on the bar under the nose of
Ihe man who wanted to knock it oil!
There were half a dozen men in the

Matter Will He the Subject of a
Special Message.
Washington, Dec. 4.—President .Cleveland 3
annual message, which w.is read iu eon
cress soon after that body convened at
noon for its Hfty-third regular session, is
as follows:
To the Congress of the nited Statis.
Tlie constitutional duty wUiclr requires the
president from time to time to Rive the_?on
trress Information of the state of the t'oion
and-recommend to their consideration such
matters as lie siiail judge necessary Is ht
tinglv entered upon by commending to the
congress a' careftil examination of tlie
detailed statements aud well-supported rec
ommendations contained in the reports or
the heads of departments who are ctiieilj
charged with tlie,. executive work of the
government. In an effort to abridge Ihis
communication as much as is consistent
with its purpose, I shall supplement a oiler
reference to the contents of these depart
mental reports by the mention of such
executive business and incidents as are not
embraced therein, and by sucli recommeiid
tions as appear to be at this paiticular
time appropriate.
"While onr foreign relations have not. at
nil times during the past year been entirely
free from perplexity, no embarrassing situ
ations remain that will not yield to tlie spir
it of fairness and love which characterize
a truly American foreign policy.
Of the outbreak in Brazil the president
says: The struggle is between the estab
lished government, which controls the ira
chiuerv of administration, and with which
we maintain friendly relations, and certain
officers of the navy employing the vessels of
their command iu an attack upon the
national capital anil chief seaport, anil
lacking, as it docs, tlie elements of divided
administration, I have failed to see that
the insurgents run rcftsou&bly clfluH roc
ognition as beligerents. Thus for the nosl
tion of our government lias been that of an
attentive but impartial observer o£ tho un
fortunate conilict.
The ouestions affecting our relations with
Great Britain have been treated in. a spirit
of friendliness. Negotiations are in progress
between the two governments witlia view
to such" concurrent action as will make tho
award and regulations agreed upon by ne
Bering sea tribunal of arbitration practi
cally effective, and it is not doubted that
Great.Britain will
co-operate
.freely with
this country for the accomplishment of
that' purpose. The dispute growing out
of the documentary tolls Imposed in the
Wcllnnd canal upon cargoes of cereals
hound to nnd from the lake Ports of ti
United Slates was adjusted by the substitu
tion of a more equitable schedule of
charges, nnd my predecessor (hereupon sus
pended ills proclamation imposing dlscrim
Pnntlng tolls upon British transit through
our canals. A request for additions to the
list of extraditable offeuses covered by the
xisting treaty between the two couutues
is under consideration.
A Special Hawaiian Message.
It is hardly necessary for me to state
bat the Questions arising from our rela
•lons with Hawaii have caused serious em-
J'Jrust*Sprlor'to
the installment of the pres­
ent administration the existing government
if Hawaii lind been suddenly overthrown
ind a treaty of annexation had been ne
gotiated between the provisional goyeni
uent of the islands and
the
United States
ind submitted to the senate for ratification.
This treaty I withdrew for examination,
ind dispatched Hon. James H. Bloont or
Georgia to Honolulu as a special commis
sioner to make an impartial investigation
tho circumstances attending the change
)f government and of all the conditions
oearing upon the subject of the treaty.
After a thorough and exhaustive examina
tion Mr. Blount submitted to. me lus re
port, showing beyoud all question that the
lonstitutional government of Hawaii had
oeen subverted with the active aid of our
representative to that government and
hrougli the intimidation caused by the
presence of an armed naval force of tlie
United States, which was landed for that
purpose nt the instance of our minister.
Upon the facts developed. It seemed to me
'.lie only honorable course for our govern
ment to pursue was to undo tho wrong that
had been been done by those representing
•is, and to restore ns far as practicable the
status existing at the time of our forcible
ntervention. with a view of accomplish
ing this result within the constitutional
imit of executive power and recognizing
ill our obligations and responsibilities grow
ing out of any changed condition brought
about by our unjustitiable interference, our
.iresent "minist-jr nt Honolulu has received
ippropriate Instuctions to that end. Thus
tar no information of the accomplishment
if any definite results has been received.
When received they will be promptly sent
to congress, together with all other iuforma
'Ion at band, accompanied by a special ex
ecutive message fully'detailing all the facts
necessary to ft complete understanding of
the case, and presenting a history of all the
uaterial events leading up to the present
situation.
The Treasury Department. •,"-.
The secretary of the treasury reports that
the receipts of tlie government from all
sources during the fiscal year ended June 30,
iS'.i.'J, amounted to SU1.71(i.rH i.04, and its
expenditures to $450.37-1,(574.lilt.

of the bullion or market value of 550.750.

It is estimated that 011 tl-.e 1st day of Julv.
1S03. the metallic stock of money in the
United Plates, consisting of coin and bullion,
amounted to $1.213,550,100. of which 5507.

ganized forty-four were located in tlie East

river, and thirty-four in the Central aud
Southern states. The total uutnber of na

of October, 1803, was 3.700, having an ag
gregate capital of $005,558,120. The net In
crease in the circulation of f-'.iese banks
during the year was $30,SS(i.O72.
Silver I'lii.'chase llepenl.
The recent repeal of the provision of law
requiring the purchase of silver bullion by
the government as a feature' of our mone
tary scheme lias made an entire change in
the complexion of our currency affairs, and
I do not doubt that the ultimate result of
this action will be most salutary and far
reaching. In the nature of things, however,
it is impossible to know at this time pre
cisely what conditions will be brought about
by the change, or what, if any, supplement
ary legislation may in tho light of such
conditions, appear to be essential or ex
pedient. Of course, after the recent finan
cial perturbation, ttnie is necessary for
the establishment of business confidence.
When, however, through this restored con
fidence tlie nionev wnleh has been fright
ened into hoarding places is returned to
trade and enterprise, a survey ol the sit
uation will prooaoly disclose a safe path
leading to a pel inanenttv sound currency,
abuiid'intly sntheient to meet every require
li'.i-ut of our increasing population and of
business. In the pursuit of this object we
should resolutely turn away from alluring
and temporary expedients, determined to lie
content with nothing less than a lasting
iitiu comprehensive lman-u.-l plan. In these
(licumstaiices 1 .1111 convinced that a roa
st 1 able delay In dealing with this subject,
instead of being injurious, will increase the
pro! abilities oi wise action. mm®*-*

fiscal year, ana ruiicii Thtercstrng' iriTorma
"tion touching this important branch of the
.'public service. That there was a larger (lis
'crepancy than usual between the postofflco
receipts and expenditures i3 the expected
and unavoidable result of the distressing
stringency which has prevailed throughout
the country during much of the time covered
by the postmaster general's report. At a
date when better times were anticipated it
was estimated by his predecessors that tlie
deficiency on the 301h .day of June. 1S93,
would be a little over S1, 00,000. It
amounted, however, to a little over 50,000,
000. At the same time, and undsr the in
fluence of liltc anticipations, estimates were
jnade for tho jcurreut fiscal year ending
June 30, 1M)4, which exhibited a surplus_of
revenue over expenditures of $372,245.71
but now. In view of the actual receipts
and expenditures during that part of the cur
rent fiscal' year already expired, the present
postmaster general estimates thJ at Its.
close, instead of a surplus
There AVill Be 11 Deficiency
of nearly $8,000,000. The pr.stofflce receipts
for the last fiscal year amounted to S75,S0(i,
933.10 and Its expenditures to $81.074,10-1.00.
This postofflce deficiency would disappear, or
be immensely decreased, if less matter was
curried free through the mails, an Item of
which is upward of 300 tons of seeds and
grain from tho- Agricultural department.
The total number of postofliees the
United States on the 30th day 01 June, 1803,
was (58.403. an increase of 1.2S4 over the
preceding year. Of these 3.3C0 were presi
dential, an increase in that class of 201 over
the preceding year, orty-two free delivery
offices were added during the year to those
olreadv existing, making a total of 010 cities
June 30, 1S03. Ninety-three other cities aud
towns are now entitled to this service un
der the law, but it has not yet been ac
corded them on account of insufficient funds
to meet the expense of its establishment.
The railway mail service not only adds to
the promptness of mail delivery at all of
fices. but it is the especial instrumentality
which puts the smaller and way p.aees in
the service on 1111 equality in that
with the larger and terminal offices, this
branch of tho postal service has therefore,
received much attention from the postmaster
genera], nnd, though it is gratifying to know
that It is in a condition of high efficiency
and groat usefulness. I am led to agree with
the postmaster general that there is room
for its further improvement.
The Navy Department.
The report of the secretary of the r.avy
contains a history of the operations of liis
department during the past "f-'ir aid ex
hibits a most gratifying coiuliUoiiofthe
personnel of our navy. He piesents a
satisfactory account of the progress ubich
hail been made in the construction of ves
sels and makes a number of recommenda
tions to which attention is speclallj In
vited. Duriug the past six months the de
mands for cruising vessels have been taany
aud urgent. There have been revolutions,
calling for vessels to protect Ameri
can interests in Nicaragua. Gautemala,
Costa men, Honduras, Argentina and Bra
zil, while the condition of atlairs in Hono
lulu has required the constant presence or
one or more ships. With all these calls
upon our navy it became necessary, in or
der to make up a sufficient lleet to patrol
the Bering sea under the modus "nyeiidl
iicrrced upou with Grfcfit Brttfliu, to detail
to tliat service one vessel from the nsh
commission and three from the revenue ma
rine.
The following vessels of the now navy
have been completed nnd are now ready
for service: The double turreted coast de
fense monitor Miantonomoh, the double
turreted const defense monitor Monterey,
the armored cruiser New York, the pro
tected cruisers Baltimore, Lliicugo. 1 bila
delphia. Newark. San Francisco, Charles
ton. Atlanta and Boston, the cruiser De
troit, the gunboats Yorktown, Concord,
Bennington. Jlacliias, Castlne aud Petrel,
the dispatch vessel Dolphin, the practice
vessel Bancroft and the dynamite gunboat
Vesuslvius. Of these the Bancroft, Ma
chlas, Detroit and Castlne have been placed
lu commission during the current calendar
year.
The following vessels are in progress of
construction: The second-class battleships
Maine and Texas, the. cruisers Montgomery
and Marble head and the coast defense
monitors Terror, Puritan, Amphltrite and
Mouadnc.ck, all of which will be completed
within one vear: the harbor defense ram
Katalidin and the protected cruisers Co
lumbia, Minneapolis, Olymnia, Cincinnati
and Ualeigh. all of which will be completed
prior to July 1. 1805 the llrst-class battle
ships Iowa. Indiana. Massachusetts and
Oregon, which will be completed Feb. 1,
1S06, and tho armored cruiser Brooklyn,
which will be completed Aug. 1 of thnt
year. It is also expected that the three
gunboats authorized by tLl last congress
will be completed in less than two years.
Immigration.
The suparlntendent of Immigration,
through the secretary ot the treasury, re
ports-that during the last fiscal year there
arrived at our ports 410.703 immigrants.
Of these 1,063 were not permitted to in ml
under tho limitations of the law, and 577
were returned to the countries from which
tliev came by reason of their having become
public charges. The total arrivals were
141.034 less than for the previous year.
The admonitions of tlie last two years
touching our public health and the demon
strated "danger of the introduction of con
tagious diseases from foreign ports lias In
vested the subject of national quarantine
with increased interest. A more general
nnd harmonious system than now exists,
actiug promptly and directly everywhere
and constantly operating by preventive
means to shield our country from the in
vasion of disease and at the same time
having due regard to the rights and duties
of local agencies, would, I believe, add
greatly to the safety of our people.
Sea Coast Defenses.
It is gratifying to note that wc have be
gun to "attain complex results in the com
prehensive scheme of sea coast defenses
and fortification entered upon eight, years
ago. A largo sum has beeu expended, but
the cost of maintenance will be inconsider
able as compared with the expense of con
struction and ordnance and nt the end of
the current calendar year, the war depart
ment will have nine 12-lncli guns, twenty
10-inch nnd thirty-four 8-incli guns ready
to be mounted 011 gun lifts nnd carriages,
and seventy-live 12-i:icli mortars.
The manufacture of heavy ordnaWe keeps
pace with current needs, but to reuder these
guns available for the purposes they are
designed to meet emplacements must be
prepared for them. Progress has been made
in this direction and It is desirable that
congress by adequate appropriations should
provide for the uninterrupted prosecution
of this necessary worlc.
Abolish the Fee System.
The report of the attorney general con
tains th? usual summary of the affairs and
proceedings of tho departine.it of Justice for
the past year, together with certain recom
mendations as to needed legislation 011 vari
ous subjects, cannot too heartily indorse
the proposition that the fee system, ns
applicable to the compensation of "United
Stales attorneys, marshals, clerks of federal
courts and "United States commissioners,
should be abolished with as little delay ns
possible. It is clearly lu the interest of the
community that the business of the courts,
both civil and criminal, shall be as small
nnd as inexpensively transacted as the
ends of justice will allow. The system is,
therefore, thoroughly vicious which makes
the compensation of court officials depend
upon the volume of such business, and thus
creates a coiiiliet between a proper execution
of the law and private gain, which cannot
fail to be dangerous to the rights anil free
dom of the citizens, an irresistible tempta
tion to tho uujustlliable expenditure of
public funds.
I also heartily join the attorney general
In recommending legislation tlxing degrees
of federal jurisdiction, as has been done iu
many of the state.-?, authorizing writs of
error on behalf of the government in cases
where final judgment ts rendered against
the sufficiency of an Indictment or against
the government upon any other question
arising before actual trial limiting the
right of review in cases of felony punish
able only by line and imprisonment to the
circuit court of appeals, and making speedy
provision for the construction of such pris
ons and reformatories ns may be neecs.-i

Asrlcultnre.
The report of tlie secretary of ngrlcultiue
will be found exceedingly interesting, es
pecially to thnt large part of our citizens
intimately concerned in the agricultural oc
cupation. On the 7th day of March, IS','3,
there was upou its pay rolls 2,430 employes.
This number lias beeen reduced to 1
,-SJO per
sons. I11 view of a depleted public treasury
aud the imperative demand of people for
economy in the administration of their gov
ernment, the secretary has entered upon tho
task of rationally reducing expenditures by
the elimination from the pay rolls of all
persons not needed for an efficient conduct
of the affairs of tho department. During
the first quarter of the present year tlie^ ex
penses of the department aggregated !?345,
070.70, as against ?4n2,021.42 for the corre
suoudlsz :iJTiod_of tho liscal year, ending
June .10: TS'13. The secretary tnalies appar
ent his intention to continue this rate of re
duction by submitting estimates for the
next iiscal year less by ?DOt,2SO than those
for the present year.
The amount of the appropriation for the
bureau of animal industry for the current
liscal year is *S."0.000. The estimate for tlie
ensuing year is S700.000. 'The regulations of
1802 concerning Texas fever have been on
forced duriug the last, year, and the large
stock yards of the country have beeu kept
free from Infection.
The total number of inspections of cattle
for export during the past fiscal year was
011,542. The exports show a falling off of
about. 25 per cent from the preceding year,
the decrease occurring entirely lu the last
half of the year. This suggests that tho
falling off may have been largely due to an
Increase in the price of American export
cattle during the year ending .Tune 30. 1.S03.
Exports of inspected pork aggregated 2*1,
(.77.410 pounds, as against -t pounds
for the preceding year. The lalling olf in
this export was not conlmed, howeicr. to
inspected pork, the total uuantlt.v exportcl
in 1802 being 005.400.010 pounds*, while In
ISO.-! It was only 527.30.S.U05 pounds.
Tue exports ot agricultural products fioin
the United States for the fiscal year ending
June 30. lfe'.)2. attained the enormous fig
ure of s.SOO.OOO-OOO in round numbers, being
7S.7 per cent of our total exports. In the
last liscal vear this aggregate was greatly
reduced, but, nevertheless, leached 5(»15.
0.10,000. being 75.1 per cent of all American
I commodities exported. A review of our
1 agricultural exports with special reference
to their destination, will show that iu al
most every line the United Kingdom of
Oreat Britlan and Ireland absorbs fat
I tlio largest proportion. Of cattle, the total
exports aggregated 111 value for the tibcal

Civil Service Reform.
The continued intelligent execution of the
civil service law and the increasing ap
proval bv the people of Its operation are
most gratifving. The recent extension of
its limitation and regulations to the .em
nloves at the free delivery postofliees, which
Ins been honestly anil promptly accom
plished bv the .commission by tho hearty
co-oper.itibn
of the postmaster general. Is
an immensely important advance iu the use
fulness of the system.
I am, if possible, more than evei con
vinced of the incalculable benefits conferred
bv the civil service law, not only in Its
effect upon the public service, but also,
what is even more Important, in its eCCt.ct
in elevating the' tone of politicnl life ten-
Sim'e 1880 congress has at each session
authorized the building of one or more ves
sels, and the secretary- of the navy pre
sents nn earnest plea for the continuance
of tliis plan. He recommends the authori
zation of at least oue battleship-aud six
torpedo boats. While I am distinctly in
favor of consistently pursuing the policy
we nave inaugurated in building up a thor
ough nnd efficient navy. I can uot refrain
from the suggestion that the congress
should carefully take into account the num
ber of unfinished vessels on our hands and
the depleted condition of our treasury lu
considering the propriety of an appropria
tion at this time to begin new work.
The Pension Ilurenti.
O11 the 30th day of June, 1S03, there were
011 ihe pension rolls 000,012 names, an in
crease of SO.041 over the number 011 the
rolls June 30, 1802. Of these there were
seventeen widows and daughters of revolu
tionary soldiers, SG survivors of the war of
1812. 5.425 widows of soldiers of that war,
21,518 survivors and widows of the Mexican
war, 3.S82 survivors and widows of Indian
wars, 284 armv nurses and 475,6-15 survivors
and widows nnd children of deceased
soldiers and sailors of the "War of the He
bell lion. The latter number represents
those pensioned on account of disabilities
or death resulting from army and navy
service. The number of persons remaining
on the rolls Juue 30, 1803, who were pen
sioned under the act of June 2i, 1800,
which Include nlso pensions on account of
death and disabilities not. chargeable to
armv service, was 450,555. The number
added to the rolls during the year was 123.
034, and the number dropped was 33,000.
The first payments on pensions allowed dur
ing the year amounted to $33,570,540.0S.
This includes arrears or the accumulation
between the time from which the allowance
of the pension dates and the time of act
Ufillv granting the certificate. Although
the'law of 1S00 permits pensions for disa
bilities now related to military service, yet
as a requisite to its benefit a disability
must exist in incapacitating applicants
"from the performance of manual labor to
such a dfcgree as to render them unable to
earn a support." The cxscution of this law
In its early stages docs not seem to have
been in accord with its truo intention, but
toward the close of the last administration
an authoritative construction was given to
the statute, and since that time this con
struction has been followed. This has had
the effect of limiting the operations of ihe
law to its intended purpose. The discovery
having been made that many names had
been put upon the pension roll by means of
wholesale and gigantic frauds, the com
mission suspended payments upon a num
ber of pensions which seem to be frnudu'ent
or unauthorized pending a complete exami
nation. giving notice to the pensioners In
order thnt they might have nn opportunity
to establish, if possible, the justice of their
claims, notwithstanding apparent invalidity.
1 am unable to understand why frauds ui
the pension rolls should nut be exposed and
corrected with thoroughness and vigor. l-
ery name fraudulently put upon these rolls
is a wicked Imposition upon the kindly sen
timent in which pensions have their oilgn.
The IndinnH.
The condton of the Indir.is and their ulti
mate fate are subjects which are related to
a sacred duly of the gor:u-amcnt. and which
.Uronglv appeal to the sense of justice and
thi* sympathy of our people. Our Indians
number about 248,000. Most of them are lo
cated on sixteen reservations containing 80,
11(5,531 across of land. ADoui 10,000 of
these Indians have, to a large degree,
adopted civilized customs. Lands iu several
ty have been allotted to many of them.
iSi.di allotments have been made to 10,000
individuals during |tlie last fiscal year,
embracing about 1,000,000. The number of
Indian government schools open during the
year was 105, an increase of 12 over the pre
ceding year. Of this total 17 were on res
ervations, of which 73 were boarding schools
and 07 were day schools. Twenty hoarding
schools and live day schools supported by
the government were not located ou res
ervations. The total number of Indian chil
dren enrolled during t-he year as attendants
of nil schools was 21.138, an increase of
1.231 over the urolllmeut for the previous
year.

cases, army officers shall bo detailed

the seed division of the department of Jig^

of this description.
Tariff Reform
Economy in public •xpendiuirc is a duty
that cannot innocently be neglected by
those entrusted with the control of money
drawn from the people for public uses.
It must bo confessed that our apparently
endless resources, the familiarity of our
people with immense nccumul itionr of
wealth the growing sentiment anioug them
that the expenditure of public mcuey
ehould iu some manner be to their Immedi
ate and personal advantage the Indirect
and aimost stealthy manner in which a
large pnrt of our taxes are exactcd. and
a degenerated sense of official accountability
have" led to growing extravagance In gov
ernmental appropriations.
The duty of public economy Is also of
immense importance in its intimate and
necessary relation to the task now In hand
of providing revenue to meet government
expenditure and yet reducing the people's
burden of crate taxation. After a hard
struggle tai-lIT reform is directly before
us. Nothing so Important claims our atten
tion and nothing so clearly presents Itself
ns both an opportunity and a duty—an op
portunity to observe the gratitude of our
fellow citizens, a duty Imposed upon 11s by
our oft-repeated professions nnd by the
emphatic mandate of tho people. A.ier full
discussion, our countrymen have spoken In
favor of this reform, and they have con
fided the work of its accomplishment to
the hands of those who are solemnly pledged
to' It.
If there Is anything In the theory of a rep
resentation in public iiiaces of tlie people
and their desires, if public officers are really
tho servants of ihe people, and if political
promises and professions have binding
force, our r.itlure fo grve the roller so long
awaited will be sheer recreaucy. Nothing
should interfere to distract our attention or
disturb our effort until this reform is ac
complished by wise and careful legislation.
•While we should staunchly adhere to the
principle that only the necessity of revenue
justifies tlie Imposition of tariff duties nnd
other federal taxation, and that they should
be limited by strict economy, we cannot
close our eyes to tlie fact that conditions
have grown tip among us in which justice
nnd fairness call for discriminating care I11
the distribution of such duties aud taxation
as tho emergencies of our government
actually demand. Manifestly, if we are to
aid the people directly through tariff re
form one of the nnst obvious features
should be a reduction in present tariff
charges upon the necessaries of life. Tlie
benefits of such a reduction would be pal
pable and substantial, seen and felt by the
thousands who would be better fed and bet
ter clothed and better sheltered. These gifts
should be the willing benefactions of a gov
ernment whose higher function Is tho pro
motion of the peojile. Not loss closely re
lated to our people's prosperity and well
being is the removal of the restrictions
upon the importation of the raw materials
necessary to our inanufaetun-rs.
The world would be open to our ingenuity
and enterprise. This cannot be while fedrai
legislation through tlie imposition of high
tariff forbids to American manufacturers as
cheap material as those used by their compe
titors. It is quite obvious that the enhance
ment of the price of our manufactured pro
ducts resulting from this policy not only
confines the market for these products with
in our own borders lo the direct disadvan
tage of our manufacturers, but also in
creases their cost lo our citizens. The inter
ests of labor arc certainly, though indirect
ly, involved in this feature of our tariff
system. Tho sharp competition and active
struggle among our manufacturers to supply
the limited demand for their goods, soon fill
the narrow market to which the-* are con
fined. 1
lion follows a suspension of work I11
nulls and factories: 11 discharge of employes
and distress 111 tho homes of our working
men. Even if the often disproved assertion
could be made good, thar a lower rate of
wages would result from free raw material
anil low taritf. docs tho intelligence^ of our
workimrtnen lead them nulcklv to discover
that their steadv omplovment permitted by
free raw material Is the most, important
factor iu their relation to tariff legislation.
A measure has been prepared by the ap
propriate congressional committee eniobdy
ing tariff -'jfofin mi the Hues .lercin sug

for legislnti'* nenon. It Is tlie result of
much patrioti.-: and unselfish work, and I

autumnal mule shows, and even if there
•were it is hardly probable thnt floxver
adorned vonna women would make a prac
tice of patting the prize animal. The only
wav to pat a mule, according to the Texas
code, is with a fence rail or a board. The
man who collected horse and mulQ, statistics
for the census report shows that the average
price of a nuile is $7 more than the average
price of a horse. The ordinary niule In
South Carolina, which owns about f5.000 of.
the long-eared beasts. Is worth about $00
the average price of a horse in the same
state is about $70. Texas probably has
more mules (about ,200.000) than any other
state The average price is about ?41, or
nearly twice the value of a Texas horse.
In Missouri mules are worth about $7 more
nnd in Kentucky about $3 more than horses.
Only a few states have no mules, or so few
that the statistician didn't make a note of
them. One of these states Is Rhode Island,
which the inule driver of Texas doubtless
would think is not any toe large a pastur
age and play ground for a festive nuile of

where horses brlog higher prices than
mules. The ordinary mule out there Is
worth $40 nnd the liorso $51. The figures
for alCalifornla are: Mules. $07 horses.
$46. Iu Pennsylvania, where mules, famous
for longevity, are much used in the mines,
they bring about $8(3: horses. $67. I11 this
state there aro seventy times ns many
horses as there are mules, which number
about 14,000. A New York mule Is worth
$01 and a horse S70. Mules are prized uioro
in New .Terser than in any other state, the
average price belnc about $100, or $30 more
than horses. Illinois has about 140.000
mules, or more than auy other Western
