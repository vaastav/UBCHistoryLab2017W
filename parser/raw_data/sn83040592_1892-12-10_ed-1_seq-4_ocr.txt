THE PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE.
President Harrison's message from
a republican standpoint is an able
document and one that is calculated to
inspire protection partisans with re
newed faith. Notwithstanding Ihe
fact that a largo majority or the
American people have declared for
free trade or tariff reform, the presl
dent devotes a good share of his mes
sage to a defense of the protective pol
icy upheld by tho republican party for
tho past thirty years.
He holds that tho democratic party
in order to carry out their pledges
must make radical changes in the tar
iff laws. It then remains to be seen
which is best for the American people
a high protective tariff or free trade.
Tho people rule, and the will of the
people should bo obeyed.
Notwithstanding the doleful howls
of calamity which find an echo in
somo portions of the West, the present
administration leaves the. country in
the most prosperous condition of any
on the face of the globe, and if the in
coming administration does nothing
to retard the growth and prosperity of
tho nation during the next four years
it will bo entitled to the thanks of
Tho whole people
Under the protective or "robber" tax
our nation has increased in wealth from
$16,000,000,000 in 18C0 to f 02,000,000,
000 in 1890. The value or our exports
during Ihe fiscal year 1892 was $1,030,
278.148, exceeding our imports by
$202,875,648. The wage earnings show
not only an increased aggregate, but
an increased per capita from $386 in
880 to $547 in 1890 or 41.71 per cent.
Nevertheless the spirit of unrest has
taken possession of (lie Americau
people and it has beeu ordained that
we must have a change. Whether for
the better or worse remains to be seen,
but Ihe people of this nation can stand
adversity as well as prosperity and if
the free trade policy does not meet the
requirements we can again find relief
at the ballot box in 1896. ;
NO MORE CALAMITY.
Tho days of calamity have glided by
and we shall hear no more those wails
of grief and misery and woe with
which Kansas orators, senators and
newspapers have filled the land. The
fight for a fair division of tho spoils
now occupies the attention of the
Kansas politician, and the mortgage
foreclosures and gold bugs, Shylocks,
plutocrats, are forgotten, and even the
robber tariff hs no place in the pub
ic mind. We may have people's par
ties and union labor parties and green
back parties, but there will be no more
calamity howling. The leaders of Ihe
people's party are denouncing the pol
icy and the alliance lecturer has been
forced to retract a number ot his state
ments regarding the depression in ag
riculture. Statistics for the past two
ears show the Kansas farmer to be
ess miserable than an Irish landlord
aud not near as unhappy as a Baptist
ircuit rider. While it may be a com
fort to unload our woes on our fellow
creatures it is poor policy to depress
prices of our real extate and depreciate
the value of our own property. Kan
sas farms that have been worked well
havo paid well aud our farmers who
bare stayed at home and tended their
crops have come out on top. There is
more money, more prosperity, more
farm products, more live sjock and
better live slock today in Kansas than
there ever has been since it was de
clared a state. People wear better
clothed, drive better vehicles, are bet
ter educated, read boiler books, make
more Christinas presents, drink better
no not belter, but more stuff, pay
more debts, stnoko better cigars and
have bigger pieces of pie than they
ever had before in their natural lives.
Calamity Jane was a libel on Ihe stale,
but ilia old chestnut is dead and let
lier rest in peace. What next ?
ltESTKICT-tOX OP laUXIGRATION.
That wbolesalo foreign immigration
is
hurting this country more than any-
ihl
ue else goes without saying, aud
thai some steps should be taken to re
si rl
el it none will deny. The tollow-
ug i
on this aubjret is from tbe Leaven-
worth Time:
For years past the couvioiion has
luv nno i our ueonle that
so
.iid niMriiirwa khoiild be adopted lo
ill further restrict immigration. The
,hiliii that moiiis srstem of selection
r hon Id be applied to Ibosu desiring lo
come lo.liiU country tor iraiucucw mu
citizenship is one which has steadily
been growing, aud is not conuufO' to
nationality or party. This fact, was
emphasized in the proceedings of tho
Wjiijl of lalwt.cpnyeij.ll5Gj.ht week,
This organization embraces in ' Its
membership adherents or ail tne noui
leal parties, natives and foreign bom,
vet the address of Grand Master Pow
derly was very pronounced in favor of
even radical restrictive measures ou
this matter even to the absolute stop
page of all immigration for a time.
The government would not be justi
fied in going to this extent, but it
would be justified in shuttiug out all
who are uot self-supporting, all revo
lutionists, and all criminals, and this
is an imperative duty which can not
be done loo soon.
A committee of both houses of con
gress was appointed, at the recent ses
sion to Investigate and report upon
the subiect. The report or this coin
mittee will be looked for with much
interest by all classes, and with the
hope that some measure may be pro-
posed which will be consistent who
the liberality of our government and
effective in protecting society against
the burdeu or a dependent ciass, ana
our institutions from the baleful in
fluence and the hostile attacks or those
who have no regard for social order
or for principles which the accumu
laletl wisdom of the centuries lias ap
proved and the struggles or genera
lions have rendered sacred.
OCR CONOREUSBf AH.
Hon. T.J. Hudson, our new mem
ber, as a public man is comparatively
unknown, but we have every reason
to believe that he will represent us in
congress ably, fairly and houestly.
He has not tbe experience nor perhaps
the capadtv of Judge Perkins, but he
certainly is In every respect superior
to Clover. Mr. Hudson made a very
favorable irapressiou on the people of
Baxter Springs and we trust he will
uot rail below the estimate we have
made or him. He may be a little off
on politics and religion, but there is
nothing vindictive in his nature and
we can well afford to suspend judg
ment until he has been fairly tried.
Tbe indications are that the Third
district will have a man in congress
who will do credit to himself and his
district aud represent the whole
people.

ANOTHER GOOD MAN GONE WRONG.
The death of Jav Gould has demon
strated the fact that this is a big coun
try and that a man even the possessor
of a hundred millions is but an atom
of liumauity. Twenty years ago the
death of such a man would have
caused a panic in all the great c
mercial centers, but today he pas
off without a ripple and tomorrow be
s forgotten. Today in this great big
prosperous country the loss of one of
be members of our school board
would cause more disaster, more
trouble, more sorrow and more genu-
lie wretchedness than the loss of a
dozen measley millionaires. We are
not living in an ago of sordid groed
and moneyed plutocracy. These are
ays of sentimental humauitarianism,
or kindly sympathetic sisterhood, of
qual suffrsge with specisi privileges
to none, of hard pan economy ana
such things. The times are out of
ioint with auch men as Jay Gould aud
is' better that be has passed away
forever.
But how fares it with Jay Gould on
the other shore? He was not in any
sense a good man. Ho was uot a
christian. He loved money not for tbe
good it could do him, but for tbe harm
could be mado to do others. He had
no fellowship with mankind here aud
must stand alone or light for first
place with bis satanic majesty on tbe
other side. Should be obtaiu a foot
hold. in tho lower house it is a question
f he does uot get a controlling influ
ence and wreck the concern, but he
may find it warm work before fie gets
through.
Many distinguished Americans will
be remembered centuries after the
Goulds, the Astors; the RockaTellers
and the Armours are forgotten. Lin-
colu, Grant, ixngiouow, - nuiuer,
Bryant, Edison, Payne, Washington,
Webster. Clay and Franklin are ail
couutrymeu of ours who did not live
all for themselves but to bless tnan-
Ind. Such men were true American
builders, while Jsy Gould wss but a
wrecker.
Jay Gould's Income was $5,000,000 a
year. Perhaps ir ne naa paia more
attention to the laws of health and
not been so greedy for wealth he
wonld be living today. IU aspired to
