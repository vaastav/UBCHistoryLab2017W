THE WEEKLY DEMOCRAT-
Thursday, December 7th, i871.
Valedictory.
With this weeks mstie termi
nates my connection as Editor
with the Kiiton Weekly Demo
crat. It) Lidding adieu to the
Readers of the Democrat, I feel
conscious of having performed
my entire duty never swerving
from the line. I had markod out
In the bpginuing to ever defend
the interests of the party, and
people at large, and I sincerely
hope the same cordial and will
ing hand will bo extended to the
in commiug Editor, Mb. L. G.
Gould, as has been extended to
words myself, their is but one
way to the success of the Dem
ocrat, and that lays with your
selves, to Rally around your
standard bearer, and give it that
support which is due to yourself
and 1he party. - It has been ever
xny policy while editing the
Democrat, to defend the true in
terests of the people by exposing
corruption and crime wherever
found, give strict and prompt at
tention to tho welfare and inter
ests of our town, to encourage en
terprise and instil vigor and ac
tion Into the minds of the citizens
to keep up with the tim s.
F. T. Foster.
To Our Old Patrons.
After years of absence, we
again return to the control of the
"Eaton Democrat." Since our
connection with the paper, many
changes have taken place with
in the political world, through
sit of which the Democratic par
ty .has passed unscathed, and
stands, to-day, the only true and
unflinching friend of a' Republi
can form of government. We in
tend to print a Democratic sheet,
i 4-Via efii nt a r r j n 4 a A0ftiAa. 1
6ion; not advocating impractica
bilities, but dealing with living
issues os they now stand.
The war haa changed the stat
us of the colored race, and for
tunately for the nation the negro
has been removed out of politics,
except so far as his social rela
tions are concerned. All the an
tecedents of the rebellion, we
shall give the go-by, and deal in
no acerimonies of the past; but
in politics, advocate a conserva
tive course, and endeavor to heal
sectional strife.
The Democrat will sustain a
republican form of government,
and advocate the true interests
of the laboring classes, as against
the intrigues of corrupt money
ed circles, land grabs and protec
tive tariffs. If there be one in
terest in tho government which
should be more cared for than
another, it is productive labor;
for from this source the nation
derives all its wealth. We will
therefore advocate the interests
of the laboring classes, and our
paper shall come to them as an
especial friend.
The usurpation of power, by
both the Executive and Legisla
tive branches of our government,
will be opposed, and the "Demo
crat" will advocate a return to
ancient land marks. In this re-
ppect we shall insist that the
sovereignty of the government
resides within the people; and
that all office-holders are but
their agents, with powers dele
gated, for the time being, on the
express condition to be used for
the benefit of tho people, and not
for their own exclusive advan
tage, as ha3 been the case for
many years; and that this princi
ple is applicable to both the na
tional and State government; and
that so far as the sovereignty of
the people is concerned, no Ex
ecutive or Legislature can by any
act whatever, permanently im
pair or take it away, to their in
jury; but that the people, th rough
their representatives, have an in
licrent right to peaceably change
or modify all such injurious acts
and legislation.
We shall further advocate that
under the Constitution, the Na
tional Government has 110 right
to impair the legitimate powers
of .the State government; for such
a course would inevitably lead to
a central despotism. . The. State
governmeLts were intended by
our ancestors, to act as so, many
wholeKome checks to a central
ization of power in the Federal
government. Of late years, there
has been a fearful tendency on
tho part of the national govern
ment to dwarf and over-ride the
State governments; and if the;peo-
ple ever lose their liberties, the
primary cause will come from
this quarter.
We do not intend to publish
an old Hue partisan sheet, but do
intend to pursue 6iich a liberal
and conservative course, that all
men who love their country and
are opposed to corruption in offi
cial stations, whether National
State or County, can cordially
unite in its support. VVe pro
pose to interest the Democrat in
the local affairs of the town and
county, but not in an invidious or
sermonising manner to the pre
judice of any one; and for this
purpose a column or two will be
set apart each week. In a word,
we intend to make the Democrat
a family news-paper, and invite
pioneer sketches, reminiscenses
of the West, incidents and acci
dents, communications on all
scientific and literary subjects,
from all parts of the county.

Meeting of Congress.
In accordance with one of
'fixtures' of our country, the For
ty Second Congress of the Uni
ted States, assembled in Wash
ington City ou Monday last. Af
ter the appointment of the sever
al committees, the President's
Message was read in silence to
that august body, and ordered
to be printed. It is not a very
lengthy document, and reflects
credit upon those who assisted
"Useless'' in composing it. The
important points in the docu
ment are "a recommendation
that the tariff and revenue be
modified, and that all - internal
txes, except on spirits, tobacco
and luxuries," be abolished a
suggestion in behalf of' the es
tablishment of a postal, telegra-
pointtijentsin the navy above the
rank of Captain be made by se
lection, and not by seniority a
recommendation for the re
moval of disabilities imposed up
on the people of the South by
the Fourteenth Amendment, ex
cept upon those whom he terms
the worst criminals tho attens
tion of Congress is directed to
the fishery question brief refer
ence is made to the Cuban ques
tion and the recent ill treatment
of American residents in the
Island of Cuba by the Spanish
authorities, and he announces
authoritatively that polygamy
will be tolerated no more under
the cloak of religion speaks fa
vorable of the preseut economi
cal, just and Christian method of
treating our Indian bauds, and
recommends a Territorial Gov
ernment for Indian Territority,
and economy in land grants.
The Message disappointed both
friends and enemies of the Presi
dent. His friends at his change
ot front about amnesty and his
enemies at the occasional streak
of common sense glimmering
through it. It will be found in
full on our outside.
gWA. colored convict, by the
name of Bell, in the Ohio Penis
tentiary, confessed to the killing
of Mrs. S. A. Ormsby, in Spring
field, Ohio, on the morning of
the I6th, o( July, 1869. He was
sentenced eixteen years for burg
lary, and has served three of
them. It is thought the Gover-:
nor will pardon Bell and he will
bo taken to Springfield and tried
for murder.
There is nothing astonishing
in the Radicals not voting for the
most eminent negro in the East.
Their professed love for the ne
gro is hollow hearted sycophan
cy; and while the base wretches
are howling negro suffrage and
negro equality, secretly they de
spise tho nation's pets, and re
fuse to support them for otlice.
Hypocrites, all?

Mr. Fish Threatens.
It is reported in Washington
that in consi quence of the late
outrages committed by the Span
iards in Cubd,both on defenseless
Cubans in the interior and on
Spaniards,. Cubans and foreign
ers alike in the cities, a note has
been addressed to Don Hamilton
Fish to his colleague, Don Maui
ioio Lopez Roberta, the Spanish
Minister, in which interference
is threatened unless a stop is put
by Spain to such outrages.
liad a note of this nature ema
nated from any other pen than
that of Den Hamilton, we should
hail it with joy as the inevitable
preieurser of the -er3' speedy de
livereueeof the United States
from an enormous disgrace, and
Cuba from the yoke of her opres
isor. But Mr. Fish bus barked
so often and never bitten, that
his threat has become a standard
joke among the Havana volun
teers. Over two years he distinctly
said to Spain: " Accept my terms
or I will give the Cubans the
rights of belligerency." Morales
Lcmus, the then Cuban Minister,
told him before he sent his ulti
matum that Spain would neitii
er agree to his terms nor reject
them, whereupon the Secretary
scoffed at .he idea that he could
be humbugged by any one. But
not only weie he and bis repre
sentative in Madrid, General
Sickles, cajoled by the Spaniards,
but the latter has been oblieged
publicly to declare tlio fact, htut
ing in his letter to Mr Bivero
that the United Stales Govern
ment refrained from interfering
in the affairs of Cuba because the
Spanish Cabinet pledged itself
that island should be treated as
an equal providence of Spain. Of
course it is not the existence of
the Cuban revolution that has
prevented the fulfilement of this
promise. The neighboring island
of Porto Rico has never revolted,
but the benefits of the Spanish
Constitution of 1869' have been
withheld from that island also,
simply because the Havana vol
unteers require it. But as if to si
lence any question as to the in
tention of the Spanish Govern
ment in the means used to pre
vent American interference in
Cuban matters two years ngo, its
subsided organ in this city open
ly asserts that Gener.'.l Sickles
should be recalled for daring to
meddle with .the internal affairs
of Spain; that if Phil. Shcrrann,
or Becerra made any such prom
ises.as thoe referred to by Gin.
-Siekles, tlny-tlid o irhTrgf Vn
thority; and finally, that Spain
has a perfect right to tr at. her
uolouies as she pleases, whether
such conduct is agreeuble -or not
to the American Government.
However, Mr. Fish knows full
well that Spain i-i utterly nntible
to repress the outrages of the
volunteers; and vet, at this elev
enth hour, he addresses threat
to a power which officially boasts
of having deluded him. and
which - is perfectly jnstifiid in
laughing at the fact.
Far Better or Worse.
That beautiful specimen of a
Prosecuting Attorney, whom the

zing from office, has made up
hia mind to emegrute to Cincin

Is it So.
There appears to be rumor on our
Streets started by those who do
not wisu to aid the School Desk
Company fund, that they intend
to open a Grocery store to sup
ply their hands. We hope that
the Company will deny this and
thrust the lie upon those it be
longs. We did not think their
was a man eo mean in Jaton, as
to start a Calumny against this
enterpise, and if he don't intend
to aid it, let him hold his peace
and not endeavor to keep others
frooa so doing. A man who is op
posed to enterprise and the de
velloping the interests of the
town m which he lives, is not a
useful citizen. And just as long
as such people remain, so long it
will stick in the mud.
