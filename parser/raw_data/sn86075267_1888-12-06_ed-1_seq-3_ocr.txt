THE PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE.
We presented, yesterday morning,
a summary of the President's mes
sage. The whole text consists of
25,000 words, and would fill nearly
two pages of the LEADER, and would
cost more than it is worth to print it.
In addition to the, matters sum
marised in. the message presented.
the President's r~commends an ap
propriation for reconnoissance and
suirvey of 'laska, a better general
law for the gradtingof pensions anti
a revision of the naturaJizatiqp lawA.
Not conteneijd with harping oil
the old free-trade question, which he
evideitly forgets was settled on th.
6th of November last, he attempts to
strike a blow at the silver coinage,
and recommends the suspension o.
the coinageof.silver.

the people who insist that Indian.

but believes that Indian prisoners
should be treated kindly and kept
in restraint far from their forme,

ates.
The President's reference to the
8ackville West incident provoked
loud laughter, but from that point the
interest in thetl.sage is lk
'Free-trade Mii nw,.ing, .theA -odh I
member who paid the slightest atten
tion to its further reading.
rill, sui. ause l- has sym
patliy for the "underdog." But the
decision was against the Tribune
Judge Bachli sba .. t.ntiHy, ,..,
call a man a blatherskite or t.bject
him to ridiculeor contempt is suffi
cient to maintain an action of libe,
and it criminal action if the wordt
were not false. LNow if the Tribunt
has not called Mr. Ray a blat her
skite or done any of the other thingb
..chalr ed i tie complaint ituundoubt
A. dly vllw id the case, but if it ha,
and its paper speaks for itself, Judge
Bach has practically decided against
it and any man with half an eye canl
see it. The LEADER has in no re
spect follpwed the example;--of the
Tribune which deeided the Havens
murder case before trial notwith
standing a magistrate, a grand jury,
the Judge of the District Court and
the trial jury decided otherwise. It
is impossible to equal the gall of the
Tribune. As to the Tribune's arti
cle we intended to say nothing but
wah' blieve it was aimed at Mi. Ray,
because he was instrumental in win
ning a large number of votes from
W. A. Clark. If the Tribune doesn'At
know when it is well used it should
find out.
THE salary allowed the city attor
ney is greater than that allowed the
county attorney and the labor in
volved cannot be nearly as much.
rYe7th iiiit would .aive been beter
4"to hav4qg ven the Police Magistrat
the teemallowed justices of peace
and have limited the compensation
to $800 per annum. It is to be borne
in minduthpt the officials arevpresent
at every meeting of the board and
will press their clhims with pertina
city, but the aldermen are retained
t~ fpreset ,the city and keep the
Sejienueat down.
FROM ANACONDA.
A i sisrig all Spicy Letter fram the
LLead e' Special Correspondent
at the (.eat Smelter City.
Speelal Correspoadence of the LEADER.
ANACONDA, Mont., Dec. 3.--A lovelier
day than yesterday, Sunlday, could hardly
have been produced. The sun was warm
and bright, and the thermometer stood at
76 0 while the adjoining hills and pine
clad mountains are enshrouded in the
cold mantle that, in its spotless purity,
best resembles the good man'sfnal sleep.
The de/out Anacondan, his spouse and
bairns, wended their solemn way to the
only
METHODIST EPISCOPAL CHURCHI SOUTiH
existing north of Mason and Dixon's
line and in sight from where I am writ
ing,and there listened to one of those red=
hot, fire-eating discourses that should
have awakened the spirit of the chivalry,
if it was not so chilled by the late loyal
republican tidal wave that swept over
Montana,
AS TO BE BEYOND RESUSCITATION.
Do you know that I have a profound
reverence for the genuine Southern? I
almost adore his lofty chivalry and hospi
tality. It was broad and almost bound
less as the stately expanse of his platnta
tion. It was warm and free as the sum
mer breeze and the fragrant bloom that
flourished everywhere over and around
his sunny home. God's green earth did
not rrovlde more 4
HAPPY AND MORE HOSPITABLE HOMES.
But in an evil hour, as at the Eden gard
en, Satan entered apd wJlidligeped the
-bliDgtg. daeresy,osseeedsi~ln, hissing the
tldhtning sound as forth streamed his en
venomed tongues surchased with sul
;pburops fire from shgol to light the con
tiient witlhh y lurid daines of fratticidnal
ivitr! Anid the hcirrid holocaust of blood
md fire, and desolution, the South wen:
down, carrying with itthe pride and glory
of the fl,.y.l.y' 'Its talisman, its charm,
ias''boaLpii' ge of safety and succes
were irretrievably lost. The masses ol
noble fellows who were charmed into
listening to Satan's syren songof a South
ern Confederacy sacrificed their all upon
the hazardous attempt to overthrow the
Union of our patriotic sires.
IN WEEPING AND LAMENTATION
they have accepted the arbitrament of the
sword andd like true men, have set to
wIrkast rebuilding the waste places and
haillitatilg their broken fortunes. A
few f the gay bid fire-eating cavaliers,
yet hankerlng for power and loath to sur
render the ancient prestige of the South,
came back from their reconstructed sov
ereignties to the National Congress.
Party assimilations, for a series of years,
were adverse to their pretensions and
ield them in check; but upon the election
of Mr. Cleveland and the resurrection of
the democracy
FROM ITS GRAVE OF REBELLION.
The war-horses of the unterrified and un
conquered South began to prance. They
saw their opportunity and "don't you for
Oet It;"they were neither slow nor slack
In making the most of it. They fell on
the necks of the Northern democracy and
with tears of joy embraced them as their
long lost kith and kin.
T.E NOT.IEItN DOUGHFACES .
could not resist. They were overcome.
Like Jacob at the well,s when Rachel's
embraces were so warm that tiHfy melted
him to tears, even so %the" tenider-hearted,
Northern democrqts wept,--and sobbed,
a.bd;wtl,4nobb 7mforted-until a Solid
south was.·al . assnred to them, that
with the Southern wheel-horses of the
Calhoun-Davis school they could take
command and, with the motto at the top
mast head, "Free Trade and Sailors'
Rights," run the ship of state, as of old,
to replenish the coffers of the co-operative
AMERICAN AND BRITISH OLIGARCHIES.
Under this insidious conspiracy, Grover
Cleveland issued his free trade message
as the key-note of the approaching presi
dentialcampaign, counting as best he
could the cost and with a firm reliance
upon his British and American allies, he
exclaimed, "Here I cross the Rubicon I
The die is cast Sink or swim, live or
die, survive or perish, I give my hand to
the Cobden club, American
FREE TRADE AND BR1ITISlI IhNDUSTRIES!"
The slogan of protection sounded and,
as again their liberties and rights were
ma ted, the mighty phalanxes of the
iion *ere marshaled. Again they came
rom Maine to Oregon,' from the Great
Lake to the Gulf of Mexico and from the
valley of the Mississippi to California,
ready with their lives, their fortunes and
their:sacred honor to mneet ,the foe and
heat backVe jiivaders of their industries
d 'their hlemes. The contest was short
anddedisivet The free trade cohorts and
their fdorignnmercenaries were defeated
.md, with their red bandannas trailing in
the dust or hanging like tallowed rags
fom their empty pocIkets, they fled in
*jstmay;he-only audible Cohthl from the
eAed ief the'trembling tents and flying
bands being
"A TARIFF IS A TAX."
I have respect, I say, for the Southern
chivalry, of whatever complexion; wheth
er accepting the results of the war for
the Union, or whether still clinging to a
timber-head of the Lost Cause; but for
the Northern dough-face, the ring-streak
ed and speckled, monarch tainted apolo
gist of free trade,.cieap'labor and pauper
industries, I have
THE UTMOST ABUORRENCE.
Of this latter class are those who, in
Montana, cry out against Marcus Daly
and anm Hlauser because, forsooth, they
Could not pull the wool over the free
American voter and delude himn into sup
porting a man who besides having been
poved to be a public Shylock who had
ieen fattened himself upon the misfor
tunes of his fellow man, who, besides be
ing a moral leper was notoriously incom
petent and
TOTALLY UNQUAI.IFIED AND UNWORTIHY
to represent glorious Montana in the
national legislature. I have learned the
eal cause of Mr. Clark's signal defeat at
Anaconda and with it the patent fact that
[Marcus Daly had no Imore to do with it
than the man in the moon, 'which will be
forthcoming in due time, showing con
clusively and beyond all controversy the
.utter senility of the venomous
ATI'ACKS OF TIlE IHAND BIn11:1
called the Great FallsTribune, which has
neveEdared to'print the name of tile
LL4DEI in its columns8, from fear that,
through its feeble instrumentality, it
might become known that there was any
other paper than the Tribune publishedi
at Great Falls.
The new $20t0,000 brick, four-story
with basement hotel here is progressing
rapidly. The masons are laying up the
walls of the fourth st.gyS. There is talk
of puttitig on a mansilyd making substan
ually a 'fifth story. It is a handsome
structure, 102 feet square and will be the
inest between the Mississippi :and the
Pacific, outside of San Francisco.
NEARLY live thousand dollars per
annum for salaiies. and rents was
inserted in the city ordinance Tues
lay evening. There will be no great
kick coming from tile taxpayers not
interested as otficials if the salaries
are kept down.

IsrND.IA.I'OIS. , December 4.--Colon(
Valker, Assistant Adjutant General (
the (4. A. R., l)epartment of Indiana, sen
ihe following printed statement to tli
Assoclated Press:
"I wcant here to protest against the
statements and interviews plublished, es
peeially in the eastern press, about thi
defection among the comrades of the C
A. R. in this delpartment. Nothing u
the kind has occurr-d and the member
ship never was mlore united and enth(Lsi
.stic in their support of tie order that
now. The handfrulofdisappoinedchron
ic: ofic. seekers here that havesucceede,
in getting thenmselves advertised through
out the country, have no standing, no11
never had, in the G. A. It.. or out of it foi
that matter. T'Ilr whole busilness lia
blon engineered lt. a ittlfil ozi'e ehrolics
At no meeting have ihey Ibeen able to so
cure the attendancen of fifty persons and
not to exceed half of these have ever been
members of the G. A. I,. No democrat
of standing or intfluence in this communi
ty, who is a member of the G. A. It,, canm
be found opposing tile order. On the
contrary, scores of comrades of that polit
ical faith have personally and by letter
denounced the attempt of these small fry
politicians. The delpartment of Ilidiana
is all right.
The Treasury i.eport.
WasirrnTorox, Dec. 5.--Tlhe following
is a synopsis of the report of the Treas
ury: The total ordinary revenues of the
government for the fiscal year (n:ling
Jutne 80,1888,amounted to $379,266,074.76,
of which $219,091,173.63 was received
front custom duties, and $124,296,871.908
from internal revenue taxes. The total
receipts fromn all sources exceeded those
for the fiscal year ending June 80. 1887,
by $7,862,797.10. The ordinary expenses
of. the fiscal year ending June 30, 1888,
were $259,653,958.67, leaving a surplus of
$119,612,116.00.
The decrease in expenditures, as com
pared with the year ended June 30, 1887.
was $8,278,220.30, notwithstanding the
payment of more than $5,000,000 for pen
sions in excess of what was paid for that
purpose in the latter mentioned year. The
estimated receipts for the year ending
June 110, 1890, are $3i7,000,000. and the
estimated ordinary expenditures for the
same time are $275,767,488, showing a
surplus of $101,232,511.66. The forego
ing statements of the surplus do lnot take
into account the sum necessary to be ex
pended to meet the require'ments of the
sinking fund act, amounting to more than
than $47,000,000 annually.

nental association finished its labors and
