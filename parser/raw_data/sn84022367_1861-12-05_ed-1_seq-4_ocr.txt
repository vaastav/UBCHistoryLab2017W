It anv two men ever held antagonistic
jiolitical views, in time- pa-t. in relation
to slayerv. those men are Henry Ward
Beecher and Edwin ('ro-we'il. toiin'ij
editor of the Albany Ada-, ihe or-au of
the New York Democracy. Hnt in the
present rebellion, there -e.-ias to he a per
fect coincidence of their views as to the re
lations the Go eminent ought to hold to
tUe institution ot' Slavery, ami the policy
whicli sho jiil be pur-Meii in reference to
it. lielow we present an extract from
tjie hitc Thank-giving serm'.n ot Mr.
Iieecher. and also an extract from a recent
speech made bv Mr. Croswf 11. If Henry
Waid Iieecher and Edwin Croswell can
statnl together, we do not well see how
there can exist any divided sentiment
among lova! men upon the Slavery que-- j
tion :

-Of ail advice that ha- bee g.ven. j
there is none that chimes more with the
northern popular impulse than this to
make a declaration of emancipation to set- !

PuUe nor foreign advice can be followed

that our institutions have failed. We are
not going to -av to the world that repub
lican institution- have so signally failed
that we have ignored them, and are going
alter the war to give back ami re-establish
others. If they hold fast our Constitution
we must not violate it ourselves. What !
wage war again-t them for violating the
Constitution, and we arc going to violate
it ourselves to get at them. We may not
object to Congressional legislation declar
ing political emancipation. I wish we
could. I wish Adam had not sinned, and j cians declare the mes.-age to bit tame and
his posterity had not been affected: but j ineffective. On the other hand, the mod

magnificent a result as the emancipation
of the slave ? Shall we rentl the crystal
instrumentjoy of the world and our
pride ? It is very easy to say it is a state
of war, but we extend nothing, we believe,
tor we are administering the men by them.
Our faith is given : we must keep it.
When we cannot abide by our promise,
there are methods expressly provided, we
must withdraw the pledged agreements of
the Constitution, and stand apart as two
.wparate peoples. Are we then shut up
in this reasoning ? No ; what the pen of
the legislator cannot do, the sword of war
will do. The South's strength in this war
is slavery. They have placed it in their
constitution as a bulwark. They are
fighting behind that, and now we have
come to the pass that we tire not able to
fi.lfill our sworn nact and maintain the in
tegrity of this land and the Constitution !

litical act. but a military, whioh they have i
compelled, that has brought on the begin
ning of this emancipation, and will carry
it to such a degree as will make slavery a
burthen to them, and make them, in the
end, the most derirous for its end."
Ckoswell's Vikws.
Suppose the munitions of war are
within our reach, would we not be guilty
of shameful neglect if we availed not our
selves of the opportunity to use them?
Suppose the enemy's slaves were arrayed
against you, would you. from any squear.
ishness. refrain from pointing against thorn
the hostile gun, and prostrating them in
death ? No; that is your object and pur
pose : and if you would seir.e their prop
erty, open their ports, and even destroy
thvdr lives, I ask you whet'ier you would
not use their slaves? Whether you
would not arm their dans great ap
plause, and carry them in hattaUions
aiainst their master ! Renewed and
tumultuous applause.
Take property wherever you may find it.
Take the slave and bestow him upon the
non slaveholder if you please. Great
applause. Do to them as they would do
to us. Raise up a party of interest against
the absent slaveholder, distract their coun
sels, and if t'lis should not he sufficient,
take the slave by the hand, place a musket
in it, and in God's name bid him strike
for the liberty of the human race. Im
mense applause. Now, is this emanci
pation ? Is this Abolitiodism ? I do not
regard it as either. It no more partakes
; of Abolitionism than a spaniel partakes
! of the nature of the Hon. Abolitionism
is to free the slaves. It is to make war

differ a- widely as do the partisan pref
erences of the people. The ultra Aboli
tion element in Congress is sorely disap
pointed by the utter failure of their efforts
to engraft their principles, either on the
President's message, or 011 any of the
Secretary's reports. This class of politi-
fully tried, an-1
oml the man of firmness necessary to
his position. The absence of till passion,
boasting and threats in the message, and
the kind and catholic spirit exhibited to
wards the deluded people of the South,
are regarded as the highest evidences of
a lofty statesmanship-"

In a chancery case before the supreme
court, the opposing solicitor, a shrewd but
not a ready djebater, had writen out a long
and elaborate argument in the style and
in imitation in part of Wirt. In the
course ot his argument lie indulged at
length in a high toned, personal, and vin
dictive strain of vituperation againit Mr.
Ormsbee and his client. So personal and
vindictive had he become, that the court
interfered and called the gentleman to or
der, suggesting that he W3.s going entirely
out of the casse, and introducing matter
wholly irrelevant. Mr. O. was sitting at
the liar with his head upon his hand, so
berly sensitive to the assault ; when he
arose with dignity, straightening himself
j up, and bowing to the court, said, May
it please your Honors, 1 hope the gentle
man may be permitted to proceed. Some
times, your Honors, that is mistaken for
something approaching to eloquence,
which is nothing more than rhe overflow
