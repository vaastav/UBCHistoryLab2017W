Washington, Doc. 7. Calling at
' ienlion to the fact ttiat the UniteJ
States it the "sample of democracy
of thfc world" and at such is con
stantly under the scrutiny of the
world, President Wilson in his last
congressional message today urged
upon congress the duty of making
this nation the champion of right
nd justice in the world's affairs.
"Only by rectifying the wrongs
within our own borders and cham
pioning the right wherever it is in
danger," President Wilson pointed
out, can the United States fulfill its
destiny'and keep faith with the fath
ers of the republic.
The President's message made no
mention of the league o nations nor
any international aspect in particu
lar. It was a short message and
j more than half of it wag devoted
to domestic affairs.
, At the last moment , President
physician and ddi not attempt to go
to the capitol and deliver the mes
sage in person before a joint ses
sion of the two houses. Instead, a
few minutes before noon the mes
sage was transmitted to each house
separately and there was read to the
members.
President Wilson began his mes
sage with this quotation from Lin
coln: "Let us have faith that right
makes might and in that faith let
us dare do our duty as we under
stand it." The simple faith ex
pressed in Lincoln's words formed
the gist of the entire document.
There was no reference to to the tu
multuous closing days of his own ad
ministration nor the incoming repub
lican administration on next March
the fouth.
President Wilson insisted upon
reading his last message to congres3
up to within a few minutes before
the document was sent to the capi

Double Track Mor
ristownAsheville Will Cost Millions
Washington, Dec. 7. It is learned
on good authority here that the
Southern Railway will double track
its line between Asheville and Mor
ristovvn, Tenn., a distance of approx
imately 90 miles.
While it was not possible to get
official confirmation of the story to
day the information that plans have
been made for the double-tracking
was gained from reliable sources and
it is expected that official announce
ment will be made in a short time.
Actual work will probably not begin
before spring as it is not possible to
do muc hconstruction work during
the winter.

Conference at Asheville
Washington, Dec. 7. President
elect Harding may go to North Caro
lina for conferences with republican
leaders as Marion is not considered
very agreeable during the cold
nonths.
Several places are mentioned as
headquarters for January and Feb
ruary. Among them are Asheville,
Pinehurst and Hot Springs.
It is said that Asheville with its
splendid hotel facilities is leading in
the race "for the honor. Hot Springs,
Va., is also in the contest. It is be
lieved here that a hard pull would
take Mr. Harding to Asheville.
The senator is strongly inclined to
go to Asheville.
From this time on conference with

BUYS CHRISTMAS SEALS

"He Couldn't Leave the Store"
Little .boy" was looking
out of the window at the
starlit heavens pondering
perhape, on the treat world be
yond. - ' - . " '.' -,
Mam ma,'-'- he said Suddenly ,
"Will I go to heaven some day!''
"Yefc dear, if you are good."
"And will you be there?"
"I hope so. And papa too,"
she added.
The boy shook his head poetive
iy.
'No," he said, ''papa won't be
there. He couldn't leave the
store."
There are thousands of men
and women who are so engrossed
with the one thing that they are
doing that they think they are
too busy for other things. They
cannot "leave the 6tore."
The business man wrapped up
in the details of his schemes for
acquiring money cannot afford
railroads undertaken very much new
work, because of the uncertain con
ditions prevailing throughout the
country, especially with the transpoi
tation systems. This piece of double
track work therefore, will be one of
the first as well as one of the biggest
new pieces of work undertaken by
any rairload in the United States
since prior to America's entry into
the world war.
To Cost Millions
It is not possible to get an esti
mate of the cost of the proposed
double-track undertaking, but it of
course will be many millions of dol
lars. The nature of the country
the Asheville.Morristown line tra
verses is such that much excavating
and grading will have to be done,
though the cost will be nothing
comparable with what it would be to
build a new line. However, along
the French Broad river which the line
parallels virtually the entire distance
from Asheville to Newport, Tenn., it
will be necessary to do much exca
vating. The roadbed for a great
part of this distance is built along
a cut in the side of the mountain,
and it will, of course, be necessary
to widen this cut very materially to
admit of laying a second track. But,
it is also true that there are many
miles of sidings in the Morristown
Asheville line which will reduce the
amount of work to be done by that
amount.
Way to Reduce
is to Reduce!
Much of the talk about price
reduction is ' merely a mental
fumbling round for come excuse
to postpone the reduction. There
are no two ways about it : the
wav to reduce prices is to reduce
them ; and the ones to begin the
reduction are the ones who began
the increase. ' Leaders must lead
the procession both ways, going
up as well art coming down, or
their leadership may be called
into question; From a purely
human point of view, the burden
of any peiiod'nf change ought to
be borne bv jhose most able to
bear it. Losses always follow
wrong economic conditions, just
as gains accrue during wrong eco
nomic conditions; those must en
dure the ooqi who have enjoyed
the other. And it is not loss at
that; it is wise investment.

Traffic over the Asheville-Morrls-town
line has for many years been so
heavy that it has not been able to
handle it with a single track, and the
construction of the double-track is
only what the road officials have
known they would some day have
to do. I
The advantages that will cornel
from this piece of work are obvious. (
It not only will enable the Southern !
to handle a great many more trains
over this line than is now being dona
but it means that the railroad will
be able to maintain better sched
ules. With the line double-tracksd

The Southern Railway's main line
from Washington to Atlanta is al-,j

line there is double
track between Morristown and Knox

entire distance between Knoxville
and Asheville is about' 132 miles.
From Morristown to Bristol, the
Southern has but a single track, like
that between Morristown and Ashe

Southern's trains are handled over

HI
Muskogee, Dec. 3. For most ord
inary mortals the running of a big
cafeteria or the management of a
successful modern farm would re
quire all one's time and energy.
But for Miss Alice Robertson, Con-gresswoman-elect
and person of di
verse talents, the two are but a part
of the many and varied activities in
which she has entered with all her
acumen and pep.
This does not mean that the farm
is not well-kept or that the cafeteria
is not up-to-date, for both are just
this and in the widest sense With
the products of her farm she haa
won many prizes and awards at fair,
while there are a few in Muskwre
who will not award her eating place
first prize in cleanliness, quality and
atmosphere.
Miss Robertson has not onlv mad.
here cafeteria successful from the
financial standpoint, but has made
it a gathering place for Muskoge
eans of every class, character. The
cafeteria is used for many lodge
gatherings of one kind and anothet
particularly by the American Legio&
and other service men's organisa
tions. During the campaign that preced
ed her election it was her politics
headquarters and that meanta foc.lhU...
entire Republican party. ' n
After election the cafeteria be
came more popular than before, for
many came there out of curiosity to
see the latest Congresswoman.
Both the farm and cafeteria are
named Sawokla fro mthe Indian word
meaning always welcone." And Miss
Alice makes everyone feel at home
at both places, for she is a real
Southern hostess when it comes to
hospitality and friendliness.
Stirring around among her patrons
at the cafeteria, Miss Robertson hai
a welcome for all. Most Muskoge
eans know her to talk to and everj
one knows her by sight.
Many votes were won and lost oy
er the soup or pie. Although Misa -Alice
rarely talked politics, she did
gain many a vote by her casual wel
comes. The cafeteria was .itartel as .
working girl's lunchroom in April.
1913 It grew and grew through
half a 'dozen different locations un
til it reached its present quarter
last May Only last Spring it was in
a basement a big office buildinjg
here.
The farm got its parts while Alice
was yet a postmaster. She bought
most of the land in 1907. It com
prises fifty-four acres, part of which
is in the city limits. Practically all '
of it overlooks the city from the
heights that have been dedicated as
a city park to those who fought in
Fraioe.
Pure-bred cattle and hogs are in
evidence at the farm. Miss Robertson
is right at home in every depart
ment. Though she leaves the actual
work to others. She knows every
thing that goes on. She has Duroc
Jersey hogs and Jersey cattle.
Most of the produce she uses at the
cafeteria comes from her farm. Vege
tables, fruits, meats, and many other
products come direct without any
middleman's profits added.
Her Sawokla farm exhibits has
taken first prize at the Oklahoma '
Free State Fair for several years.
While her 1920 exhibit was not ub
to former years, it contained forty
varieties of fruits and vegetables ia
cans and jars.
