are grouped together by their different
owners on an open piece of ground. '
The buyers then crowd around and
ask questions about the age. health and.
, in the case of a woman slave, if she is p
married. The owner always says that
the woman slaveB are still unmarried, as
single women usually fetch higher prices F:
than married women. Of course, there
is always haggling over the price, especially
if there is some physical defect,
which is invariably the case. The 3
teeth are inspected, arms are pinched,
and a male slave is often asked to lift te
heavy loads.
Contrary to the general belief, the lot 5,
of the slave in Morocco is a compara- ,'
tively happy one. All they have to do ,,

which form part of the rich Moors' a
estates. Another duty is to keep watch ic

HUGE INCREASE IN COST
Nation Plans Foundation Upon
Which Large Force May Be
Built. If Needed.
BY GEORGE WITTK.
Special Cable to The Star and Chicago Daily
News. Copyright. 1920.
BERLIN. Germany. December 11.?
Beginning January 1, Germany will
have an army of 100.000, the size allowed
under the peace treaty, but it
will be an army of 100.000 officers.
Germany will thus have the best
trained army in the world.
The army budget, which comes up
for debate in the reiclistag at an
early date, is put at a,Oi)0,000,000
marks (nominally $1,000,000,000). Before
the war the kaiser spent only
1.000.000,000 marks ($200,000,000) annually
for both army and navy. In
1513 the army cost Germany 1,085
marks ($271.25) per man, officers included.
Next year each soldier will
cost 50,000 marks. (The present value
of the mark, instead of being 23.8
cents in American money, is less than
a cent and a half.)
Selective Training Proposed.
Germany will put every man through
a selective training course, winnow
out the unpromising material, and
Rive, the rest a thorough military
training, or such as only officers have
received heretofore. Already there
are academies in existence where
privates are taught the elements of
modern military leadership and are
given practical instruction in all
branches of the service. These academies
will eventually be built up into
large universities, which every member
of the German army may be compelled
to join to pass examinations.
after each school period. j
Germany will thus receive a solid I
foundation on which at any time a
large army can be built. The present
army is composed chiefly of noncommissioned
officers of the old regime
and others who are thoroughly
militaristic in their views, Their
leanings are far more monarchistic
than'democratic, and whether, in case
of a monarchistic uprising, they would
remain loyal to the social democratic
government is more than questionable.
Expfiiltma Explained.
In some quarters where the government
is condemned for lavishing
such large sums on the army it is
said that the idea behind these preparations
is to have officer material
to lead the militia organizations,
particularly the "orgetsch," in case
of internal or external trouble. Today's
Freiheit declares that the nationalistic
delegate, Herr von der
Osten. admitted in the Prussian diet
the other day that the "orgetsch"
now numbered more than 1.000.000
men and was daily gaining recruits
not only in southern Germany, but
also in Berlin and recently in the
occupied areas "under the noses of
the French, British, Belgians and
Americans."
Regular Rifle Practice.
Herr Sevring. Prussian minister of
the interior, announced that the
orgetsch had at its disposal large
quantities of arms and munitions,
and that the members were holding
rifle practice regularly, despite his
order forbidding it.
The left wing parties are continualIv
warning the government to cut
down the army budget because thpy
would not stand for such vast expenditures
for an "army de luxe"
in the face of the great misery everywhere.
The Independent socialist
communists threaten _ to organize
militia organisations 01 woramen 10
fight the government troops If the'
budget goes through.

Crowd Before Parliament Fired

PRAGUE, Csechoslovakia, December
10.?A detachment of police endeavoring
to clear away a crowd of demonstrators
from in front of the parliament
building today, finding itself
surrounded and attacked, the authorities
allege, fired upon the crowd,
wounding at least eighteen persons,
four of them seriously.
The government buildings are being
guarded by troops.
Dispatches from Prague Friday reported
upward of fifty casualties
among policemen and civilians in
fighting for possession of the central
offices of the social-democratic party,
the right wing of that party finally
succeeding in overcoming the left
wing and-taking, possession of the
building. The message added that a
general strike was ordered as a result
of the clash.

Employes and Workers Both
Making Efforts to Get
Together.
BY EDWARD PRICE BELL.
Special Cable to The Star 'and Chicago Daily
News.
LONDON, December 11.?Employers
and employes in Great Britain are
making heroic efforts to get together.
Both sides are coming to realize that
co-operation is the price of national
solvency. Labor is gaining ground
morally and materially. Its authority
and wages have surpassed all previous
records. And it Wants still
more. Every sign points to its get
ling anil more.
Some of the ablest employers and
students of economics in the country
have joined . labor's demand for a
share in industrial management and
for participation in the growing
profits. Sir !?. Worthington Evans,
minister without portfolio, says
"Workmen must have a greater
direct interest in the results of their
labor. Their genuine interest must
be aroused. They must be partners.
They no longer will live contentedly on
the plane of mere wages. Nothing else
promises so much toward prosperity
as does the continued improvement in
the status of the workers."
"We are bound to believe in the
Priestman plan." says Sir Samuel
Waring. "It has already proved a j
great success. It chooses a standard
output for determining a standard
wage, and as this standard output is
exceeded, all other conditions being
equal, wages are increased in the same
percentage.
"Wherever employed this scheme
has resulted in increased production.
engendered friendship and confidence.
improved the timekeeping,
rendered supervision less necessary,
reduced jealously and increased the
earnings of the men. We employers
must realize that henceforth only
demonstrably fair treatment of the
workers will bring Industrial peace."
"We must have community of interest
and community of reward resulting
from the effort of community."
declares J. Ij. Clynes. M. P.. president
of the National Union of General
Workers. "What we supremely need
Is a change of spirit. Justice and
sympathy must supplant greed and
enmity. Only the right spirit can
make the best system work. Unemployment
must be abolished. Workmen
must have a guaranty against
starvation, and it is ' much cheaper
to give them this than to have underproduction.
If we workingmen

never serve their own interests

good will and guaranties
against unemployment production will
be abundant. ' We must co-operate

on the field of battle. Otherwise our
victory after the war never can be

That British warship construction
would react expansively to
naval expansion abroad has been
pointed out frequently. Kconomy will

will be placed above economy, and
there is every Indication that the nation

British statesmen and ordinary citizens
would like to have a naval understanding

agree that British warships and
American warships should be complementary

JERUSALEM. Palestine, December
?Palestine is not "flowing with
ilk and honey," but the Zionist
immission has now perfected a pro.
"am for Introducing modern science
' bring water from the rock and
anna from heaven by means of the
ionist ?25,000.000 (normally $125. 0.000)
fund for which a drive is to
sgin in the UnPed States within a
w weeks. This marks the end of
le preliminary stage of Zionist dlomacy
and propaganda and the benning
of the practical stage of deslopment
and hard work.
Development of Farm Land.
How hard this work is the writer
scovered on seeing the Zionist colerative
agricultural group at Diln
ansform the rocks of a mountain
to a fertile farm. Here, where
irmerly only were scrub bushes.
iere will be raised grain, vegetables,
ttle, poultry and trees under sciitific
direction. This is typical of
le heroic program of the Zionists,
ho are undertaking to apply science '
id religious zeal to make an imiverished
land capable of sustain- |
g hundreds of thousands of immi- j
rants. The foundation fund, ac- ;
irding to the leaders here, is to j
> devoted solely to economic de- j
slopment in conformity with the !
idge Brandeis plan, and not to chary
and relief, as heretofore.
"Twenty per cent of the fund." said j
r. I*ssi8hkin. chairman of the local
onist committee, "will be devoted
the purchase of land and the reainder
to house-building, Industrial
id Tarm credits, immigrants' settleents
and public works. This will
i an entirely productive investment,
fie Jewish pioneer thus aided will
irn a living. Immigration is now
rictly limited, but eventually, unT
scientific development, the land
ill be able to support 2.000,000 ipore
lople than are now here. It will
i a refuge for Jews who are vie- j
ms of pogroms in eastern Kuropeld
a center of Jewish art and litature."
Power From River Jordan.
Typical of the economic developent
schemes is the program of Pinis
Ruthenberg for industrial power
om the River Jordan, in which
:sus was baptized.
"This river," said Mr. Ruthenberg.
s capable of supplying power to
1 the industries of Palestine, large ]
id small, and also to lighting and j
reet railway plants. The plan will j
Ciuae me irrigation ol a large p<ti l t
northern Palestine and the draing
of extensive malarial regions,
lis will make possible the eventual
pport of upward of 1.000.000 purely !
idustrial people. The chief dam ;
ill be Just below the Sea of Galilee, i
e expect to begin work next spring :
id complete the main structures in
to years at a cost of ?2,000.000
lormally *10.000.000)."
Approved by Commission.
The Ruthenberg scheme has the
11 approval of the Zionist commison.
and it is understood that the
ritish government is favorable to
, , Since immigration was formally
fmitted. three months ago, pioneers
ive been arriving at the rate of
>oUt 500 a week. Many are uni. rsity
graduates. The average age
twenty-two and the percentage of
omen is seventeen. Most of the
ork now being done is rock-breakg
and road-mending under co-opative
contracts with the governent
because funds for land developent
must be awaited. For
the time being the Zionist orinization
is so poor that it cannot
ly shoes for these pioneers, many
whom crossed the seas as fourth- I
ass passengers and came here from !
e coast on foot. One man came
Ithout any belongings, save a comete
set of Spinoza's philosophical
ritings. But all are warned that
onism means terrific labor and sufring
for years. The immiytntion.
iw limited to about 30,000 annually,
ill be increased as the pioneers de
lop land that will support an ineased
population. The technical
id economic difficulties would make
e Zionist program hopeless without
ligtous zeal. Only sweat and faith
it make Canaan a land of promise. I
TOURISTS AVOID HAITI.

PORT AU PRINCE, December 11.?
nericana seldom come to Haiti expt
on business. It is the rarest thing
see a tourist here, and ship travelers,
opping at this port for several hours,
sh aboard again after a hurried xury
of the water-front section. The"
rdes of beggars besetting the visitors
they attempt to walk through well
ve<t (streets, lined with the lame and
e blind, discourages the visitors.
The chamber of commerce, mindful of
is evil, is trying to end it. for the
ganization admits that it is the thing
at turns the tourists away. Aside

iout 200 Americans in the capital,

the We
BV BEN McKRLWAY. t
CENTRAL. AMERICA, rich in '
undeveloped natural re- c
sources, caster to welcome the v
P
exploitation of its hidden
1 wealth by American capital, is a v
veritable land of buried treasures, and ?
; the,next few years will reveal par- ^
tially the great possibilities which lie n
: there, according to Alejandro Cesar. S
recently appointed minister to this
' country from Nicaragua, and a new ti
arrival here among the Latin Amer- tl
ican diplomats. n
i While trade with the countries of tl
South America has been increasing by tl
leaps and bounds. Central America,
because of practical isolation from
the world of commerce?due in part
to a lack of transportation?has n
shown comparatively little progress C
in obtaining the patronage or atten- c
tion of the American business man. o
Central America is handicapped by w
a lack of rail communication between c;
the five republics, and by lack of n
facilities of modern transportation
between the Atlantic and Pacific sea- ?
boards. Mr. Cesar directs attention
to the fact that it takes days, some- 1
times weeks, to communicate between ?
places which could be traversed in J"
a few hours by rail.
Rubber, hardwoods, coffee, sugar, P
minerals and oil are found in fi
abundance within the territories occu- c
pied by the five Central American re- s
publics. Yet comparatively small e
quantities of these materials find their t|
way to the hands of the American im- g
porters. Ports on the Atlantic side
within three days' sail of New Orleans
are passed by vessels which
'go far beyond to obtain their cargoes.
Using Nicaragua as an example of n
[a land of opportunity, Mr. Cesar declares
that a population of approximately
1,000,000 occupies a small part o
:of a country which embraces a terri- >
j tory half as large as France. Great c,
areas rich in minerals, furnishing an a
ideal soil and location for agriculture 8
J and cattle raising, lie untouched and 0
unsettled. .
A railway, financed by Americans, "
Iwill be completed in Nicaragua with- "
in three years, and will connect the v
itiigh, interior part of the republic
with Monkey point, on the Atlantic w
coast. This railway will open for w
J exploitation and development a virgin ii
j land. Other republics of Central t
America are planning railroads, seek- a
jing in America funds for their con- h
j struction and going forward on the
I work when the money is secured. The c
'next few years, Mr. Cesar believes,
will witness an era of remarkable
progress in this direction. "
Discussing the proposed union of ?
the Central American republics, Mr. 11
Cesar declares Nicaragua favors the 81
plan, but his government hesitates to cl
approve the union until the states are ir
more closely connected by modern ri
means of communication. A union, he a;

even more than English. Nearly two jr
hundred American students have ma- ni
triculated at Oxford, forty at Cambridge,
sixty at London University 61
and thirty at Edinburgh. Thirty m
American Rhodes scholars are due at pi
Oxford in January, and there are al- it
ready thirty-three Canadian Rhodes h
scholars in residence there. 1 ei
Americans are taking an increasing tc
part in university debating and dra- m
: matic societies, and they are grad- ?.'
ually wresting away the supremacy
in athletics. The use of American m
slang, a few years ago regarded as
barbarous and strange, is now so t!
general as to be almost the rule. The G
' English studetfts are quick to seize pi
on American slang. m
The entrance of American women at
Oxford is undoubtedly due to the re- I tc
cent granting of full university mem-j^i
bership to women. Their arrival has! 'j
introduced real American social life.
In addition to the American club there fe
is now an American Women's Club. a)
which is the social center for its p,
members. w
The rush of Americans other than
Rhodes scholars is due to the de- st
cision to offer the Ph. D. degree as a
special attraction to Americans with .
bachelor degrees. 1
OPEN POLITICAL SCHOOL. B

BERLIN, December 11.?A German
school of political science, the dream ac
of the former chancellor. Dr. von tli
Bethmann-Holweg. long before .the j,j
world war. at last has been estab- .
lished in Berlin. The dedication of !a
the new school was made the occa- 13
slon for much congratulatory talk by es
high German officials, who expressed
the opinion that a line of statesmen
woud be developed by the new institution
to direct the progress of the '41
German republic toward ils former u'
high place among the nations.
Foreign Minister Simons in an ad- m
dress declared German statecraft had c'<
always lacked trained leaders thor- It
oughly schooled in political science isl
and for that reason the people had wi
had small faith in their officials. He ge
hoped that the new school would help
establish such a faith. to
Plans are to operate the school gl'
along the lines of the Ecole Libre de go
