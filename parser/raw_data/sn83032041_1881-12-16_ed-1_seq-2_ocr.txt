eoENSBunc. pa.,
FRIDAY, DEC. 16, 13S1.
I r appears fio.;t the- i'realdcnt's mes
sage tliitt of tie f.ft'.vn millions of dol
lars of fruc 1 currency outstanding,
only about. ei y thousand dollars have
been re.it fined during the past year.
The government will Le the gainer by
many millions of dollars from the fact
that most of this idiiuplastcr currency
was worn out during th3 time it circu
lated so freely throughout the country,
and will therefore never be presented at
the counter of the Treasury for redemp
tion. A llEPi'i.i.K as member of the IT. S.
Sena1 e, says he 1k,s it from President
Arthur that Grant will be permitted to
name one member of hi3 CaVinet. but
thunfar our second Washington is unde
cided a3 between ex-Senator Chaffee, of
Colorado, and NTcd. 13 ale, of Washing
ton, who knows all ubcutt hoists. Al
though Grant's youngest sou is married
to Chaffee's daughter, still, if Arthur
has agreed to permit Grant to select a
memh'jr of his Cabinet, we will bet on ;
JNed Ileale against tho held. ;
Nearly every member of the Ken
tucky Legislature, in iespunse to an
overwhelming popular demand, has re
fused to accept free passes from the rail
road companies. If there was a session
of the Pennsylvania Legislature ;this
winter we would like to see how many
of its members would imitate their Ken
tucky brethern. Free passes have done
more to destroy the usefulness of Legis
latures In this State than all other influ
ences combined not even excepting the
corruptions of the lobby with Bill Ke ta
ble as its head and front.
The Philadelphia Timrt, the prospec
tus of which for 1-2 will be found in
mother part of our paper, still main
tains its well-earned reputation as an
able an J admirably conducted newspa
per. Col. MeCT.ir.-, its editor, has
waged a most vigorous and untiring
warfai-2 against the rule of corruption
and oilicial profligacy in that city, and
deserves the thanks of its citizens for
Lis devotion to their best interest?. A
paper as fearless and independent as the
Times is a terror to wrong-doers in any
community more to be feaied, iu fact,
than an army with banners and for
that and many other reai"v::Hit deserves
to be. most liberally sustained.
(: Monday last the President nomi
nated to the Senate Frederick T. Fre
linghuyseii, of New Jersey, as Secretary
of State, to succeed Mr. Blaine, who
formally resigned his ofllee when Mr.Ar
thur became President, but continued
in the discharge of its duties at the Pres
ident's request until the meeting of Con
gress. The nomination was immediate
ly confirmed. Th5 new Secretary was
formerly a member of the Senate and is
a nephew of the Fr-lia';huys.m who was
the Whig candidkte for Vice President
in l-j-ll ou the ticket with Henry Clay.
The writers of Whig campaign songs, to
enliven that most exciting contest were
put to the. severest tri.ils in order to find
woids that would rhyme with Freling
huysen's outlandish name. The chorus
to one that we remember ran thus:
"And 'e'll give the Locofoccs pizen
With Henry Clay and Frelinchuysen."
The gnat and nm;sual length of the
President's message forbids its repro
dueUon in uir columns, but wo do the
next best thing ..by, publishing a synop
sis of it containing it3 most important
features. A President's message ought
to be lika the widow M?lone's song,
"not long, but strong." Instead of
this, each incumbent of the office tries
to outdo his predecessor in the length of
his official communication to Congress,
and a paper of ordinary sue ia thus pre
cluded from laying it before its read
ers, unless it excludes everything else,
The message as a whole is a plain, busi
ness like paper, with no straining at ef
fect, and as it discusses public questions
in a calm and temperate spirit it has
been very favorably received by the
press and the people of the country.
Mr. Arthur's trouble, however, from
the very nature of the circumstances
surrounding him, is certain yet to come.
ALTitoron Logan, of Illinois, failed
at the last syssiou of Congress to get the
Senate to pass his bill placing Grant on
the retired li.-t of the army with full
pay, he is dctei mined to put the thins
through if lie can, and on the very first
day of the present session lie rode the
same hobby into the Senate chamber.
Logan ought to bo ashamed of such a
performance, and his friend, Ulysses S3.
Grant, ought also to be ashamed for per
mitting it. A man like Grant, who is
worth ball' a Trillion at bast, is not a
proper. 1 ei son to be placed on the retired
list, and especially so as he is a private
citizen, and has now nu more connec
tion with the army of the United States
than tho Lmperor of China. It is be
lieved by some shrewd judges of men at
Washington that Logan's real purpose
is to retire Grant aa a third term candi
date, in order to make room for himself
for a P.rst term in 1S4. It has long be en
supposed that lie is troubled w ith a weak
ness of that kind.
JosF.ru II. JiAixKv, the coloic l ex-.
Congressman and a candidato for Chief :
Clerk of the House at Washington, has I
discovered, or has l,l4 1 a mighty fair
chance to discover, the utter hollowness
of republican professions of love for its ,
faithful ally.the negro voters. Two years 1
ago, when the Republicans in the House
couldn't elect him, or anybody else, he
bad no difficulty whatever in obtaining i
the nomination; but now, when they :
have the vot:-s to organize the House in
their own way, and Ilainey again conies
up smilir.g and insisting upon the place, '
Ldw.-.rd MoPherson, w hite, of this State, ;
a chronic oftice-seeker, steps in and car-
rif.i the caucus by a vote of !-2 to 42 for
Ra.'.c;. . r.xry m;tn of common sense,
I: new well that in fmch a contest Rain- :
r-y would be remors 'e;'y slaughtered. '
He is certain, however, to receive tho ;
ro'.-iir uion for the House clerkship just j
s soou as the Republicans find them
selves in the minority, and therefore '
powerless to elect him. J
M.
01 i'.'j'vy-ii f; cm this d. ft riot. accoutring
to iiii ;.!ie re pons from Washington,
swore more terribly than "our army in
Flanders"' when he was coerced, iu obe
dience to the imperious demand of Don
; Cameron and against his own settled and
better judgment, to vote in the Repub
lican caucus for Keifer, of Ohio, instead
of Ilisceek, of Xew York, for Speaker
of the IIous". Gen. C. is just as com
! potent, if not a good deal more so, to
know who ought to be nominated for
' Speaker as Cameron is to tell him, but
for some low personal purpose of his
i own the Pennsylvania "boss" wanted
: Keifer nominated, although not a single
; Republican member from this State was
; favorable to him. Cameron, however,
; insisted upon a united support by the
; Republican membersfrom Pennsylvania
and what was Gen. C. to do ? If he vo
ted against Keifer, whom the boss want
ed, and for Hiscock, whose defeat the
bo?s was determined to accomplish, he
was certain to bring down upon him the
wrath of the house of Cameron, and be
ing thus placed between the devil and
the deep sea, he went with the majority
of the delegation, voted in accordance
with Cameron's edict, and took his re
venue in unlimited vollies of profan
ity against the tyranny of boss rule and
the abject slavery to which it reduces a
man like himself, who claims to bo his
own master, when he is forced to yield
and protest. To see a man like Gen. (,
who knows what is right and approves
it, and yet by the force of political pow
er and patronage, wielded by another, is
compelled by personal considerations to
pursue the opposite course, which he
condemns, shows the despotic rule ex
ercised over Pennsylvania Congressmen
by Cameron, who don't possess a single
attribute to make him feared except his
position as a Senator and his money.
AVhen will men assert their own abso
lute independence, not only in name, but
in fart and by their deeds ?
Cor.. John VT. Forney, the well
known politician and journalist, died at
his residence in Philadelphia on Friday
morning last, after only three days' ill
ness, in the sixty-fifth year of his age.
Ever eince lto, when he became the
editor of the Penngylvanim, the leading
Democratic paper of the State, Col. For
ney has been prominently before the
country in on capacity or another. A
detailed nairativo of the part he has
played upon the public stage is there
fore unnecessary. The following, which
we copy from the Philadelphia Record,
expresses a just and true estimate of his
character. That paper says of him :
The death of John W. Fornev takes out of
the list of living men the most noted and tal
ented journalists in Philadelphia, lie was
more than a clever man socially he- was an
active, scheming and forward politician, full
of shrewd Instances and plausible prece
dents, and he was a patriotic citizen : but
he was at his best as writer for the press. He
was, like many other of our public men,
iiew;paper-made. lie fell short of the
breadth of statesmanship, and in so far as
his rareer was a disappointment to himself
or hii friends the true cause probably was
referable to the fact that his ambitions were
not always in line with his abilities. Few
public men had a wider acquaintance than
Mr. Forney. Popular manners, a s'nive nnd
easy address, and that universal kinship
which springs from a kind heart, made ami
kept for him a host of friends among all
classes of people. In his partisanship Mr.
Forney refused to merge his friendships,
though his impulsive nature made him as
sentimental in his beliefs as in his affections.
The passionate incitements of the civil war
swept him from his Democratic moorings,
and he went as far as the farthest in his at
tempt to break down the party which it had
been the work of his life to build up. But
there was no venom in his nsture. After
the war was over his vindie iveness melted
away in the glow of renewed f i iendships snd
the pride of a reconstructed Union. His
views were widened and amplified by for
eign travel and asst ciiitir.n. When he died
he was less of a partisan than a patriot. His
loss makes a cap that must remain unfilled.
We do n';t think that he leaves behind him a
personal enemy. Psace to his ashes.
Tnr; Commissioner of Pensions states
in hi3 report that there are now pending
for settlement 20o,o75 original pension
claims, 227,040 of which were filed prior
to July 1st, It is stated that 13
per cent, of the number of claims now
pending will Le rejected or aban.loned,
which would show the probable admis
sion of about 103,000 claims, all of which
involve the payment of arrears of pen
sion. It is found that every case allow
ed requires for the first payment upon it
about Jt,3u0, and multiplying this
j mount by the whole numberjof proba
ble admissions cive? nearly $250,000,000
as the sum required. This arrears of
pension is the most stupendous swindle
of the kind that was ever railroaded
through Cong re n. The men who had
tho bill in charge and engineered it
through both houses two years ago al
leged that it would not take out of tho
tieasui) more than fifteen millions of
dollars. Under this flimsy prepense the
bill easily passed, and now the figures of
the Commissioner of Pensions reveal the
full extent of the gigantic fraud. Con
gress ought to interfere and put an end
to the pUmdcnngbcheme if it can. Has
it the. power to d so V VW do not think
it has, but that liavii.-g embarked in the
business it is si-o p-d fi-.iu now annul
ling it, and must carry out its provi
sions to their legmm.;e consequences.
Secretary of the Common we a lth
M. S. Quay, was in Washington last
week, and is reported as having stated
to a member of Congress from thisStato
that Governor Iloyt will not call an
extra session cf the Legislature togeth
er during the present winter. We pre
sume that Mr. (uay spoke by authority
and that therefore the present Congres
sional, Senatorial and Representative
districts, as well as the Judicial districts
will remain as they now are until tho
im-el iug of the Legislature in .January,
lSS'J. The refusal of tho Governor to
call the Legislature together will save
the State between one and two hundred
thousand dollars, and if the apportion
ment biil to be pased bj Congress at the
present session shouldgive the State one
or two additior.nl members, they can bo
electfrd as candidates at large, as was
done on a former occasion. Xor can
any real, substantial harm be done by
eUeting Senators and Representatives
in the present districts next November.
rosTMASTER-GEXKRAL ,I.MES will
retire froin otiicc on the first of January,
to assume the duties of the Presidency
of ;i Xew York banking institution.
Ueyond all question he has Leen one of
the most competent and efficient officers

Grant's friend, Filley, of St. Louis, will
take his place.

HOW TO KEEP WOLFE OfT OF THE FIELD.

' no matter what his record, the people, taught

emboldened less courageous hearts, and Rt

! uncomfortable thev become. They are now
; badly alarmed. A!i the jrreat Republican
! leaders are quarrelling before one man.
! They recognize the necessity of keeping
i Wolfe out of the field as an independent
l candidate. Even the most stalwart Repub-
lican orgnns make pretense of concealing the
j fact that there is danger ahead. But a sin

j Gratitude is oce of tha most beautiful

Tl;e good this will accomplish by the cultiva

: the people, especially the common people,
should be more than grateful. Thev should
be thankful that Mahone has broken the

others to chastise them with the sc.our.ee of

There are a thousand other things for which

I FKA1VKES WITH VARIOUS OPINION
AND COMMENTS TSEUEON",
President Arthur on Tuesday of last week
1 ient his first message to Congress. It is a
lengthy paper and ipiite replete in dealing
' with the uppermost topics relating to the af
I fairs of our goyernment. We have not the
i space to give the message In full, but the fol
j lowing review of it which we take from
i the Philade!phia.tfr, will be found to con
! tain the leading points of the document. In
; presenting a condensation of the message,
; all that part of it which relates to foreign af
fairs may be dismissed with the brief state
: ment that but a few points call for remai!:.
i Tiie Spanish Government Is annojingsome
of our shipping that gets to her porta with
vexatious fines and other interferences : the
treatment of American Jews in Russia has
been the subject of energetic remonstrances
; tog lat Government; the President regrets
! the injury to our commercial interests by the
! withdrawal of our;steamships to Brazil ; and
; he has supplemented the action of President
, Garfield with reference to the proposed F.u
! ropran protectorate over the Panama Canal,
' by opening negotiations with the British
government for the modification of the Clav
, ton-Bulwer treaty. That treaty concedes to
I Great Britain a joint protectorate with the
j United States. With thee exceptions, and
that of the Chilian war with Peru and Boli-
via, presently to be mentioned, everything is
j satisfactory with our foreign relations, and
I there is nothing iu the Message about them
that is not already known As to the Chilian
i question, it is to be regretted that the Mes
sage is not fuller and more .peeific. Tiiere
have been allegation of extraordinary inter
vention r. the part of our ministers in Chili
' and Peru, of the truth of which, or the ex
i tent of which, if i'i any degree true, but lit
tle is known, except through partisan discus
sions in the newspapers ami other unauth.-n-;
ticated publications. Possibly pending ne
gotiations or diplomatic instructions to the
special envoy, Mr. Presscot, just despatched
to those countries, may not permit the State
Department to give publicly to he very in
teresting movements that appear to be e'oing
, on. The event may prove that it would have
been better to place more confidence in the
, people about these matters in their present
stage. The Secretary of State is known to
be an energetic apostle of the exclusive jur
! i-diction of the United States in th political
, affairs of the countries on this continent to
the southward of our southern boundary
j line in all cases where mediation, protec
tion, or intervention Is needed. Large rnass
! es of his countrymen have doubts as to
1 whether it is worth while for the American
Government to embroil itself with other Gov.
: erninents on either side of the Atlantic in the
j enforcement of that idea. Without entering
inio concussion as to wnether tho persons
1 who entertain these are; richt or wrong, or
whether the Secretary of State may get to
! he too "aggressive," so to speak, on tho
"Monroe doctrine," it mav be well enough
to remember that there is no prevailing pub
lic sentiment in this country now in favor of
intervention in the affairs of our continental
neighbors, or of getting into entangling alt i
ancesof any sort. The cry of "manifest des
tiny," which was a cieat nuisance in its day,
was hushed long ago ; and the career of the
"blue eyed man of destiny" eanio to a rath
er inglorious end, about the time when Sec
retary of State, bewail to think of going to
Congress.
The rest of this section of the Message
shows everything to he feerene. Home af
