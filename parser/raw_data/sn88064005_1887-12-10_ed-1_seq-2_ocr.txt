SATURDAY, DECEMBER 10. 1837.
FOR GOVERNOR:
Cen. F. T. Nicholls,
OF ASSUMPTION.
The job printers' strike is report=
ed at an end in Chicago.
Mf. Sadi-Carsot was elected presi
dent of the French republic.
Reports from all parts of the
State are encouraging for General
NTicholls and reform.
Five hundred Italian immigrants
feeently arrived in New Orleans
from Palermo, Italy.
The lelegate column, at last re*
ports, stands Nicholls S3, McEnery
57. This is a correct statement of
how the two cadidates stand.
The McEneryites, finding them
selves defeated in every quarter, and
at their own game, are now crying
'for fair play and claiming that they
are being cheated.
He is in a quandary as to which
of the two possesses the most charms
of mind and person, the brunette or
the blonde.-Gretna Courier.
If left to us we would, without
laeuitency, proclaim the blonde.
The convention is bound to recog
Mize Tenaai' nineteen votes and white
supremacy for McEnery.-States.
Stop a little Major, the people of
Loujeisna will have something to
say about that at the proper time.
And don't you forget it.
The Ring, faction were the first to
cry out for white supremacy, the first
to introduce negroes to vote in the
Democratio primaries, the first to
loft, and It will be the first to en.
counter defeat on the 10th of next
January.
The Rayne Signal has trotted out
itsabig rooster. Guess4t's to:row
over "white supremacy's" victory in
that parish by tk aid of assisted.
home nigger votes. It was such
.'pawn as this that gave Mac thirteen
majority at Rayne.
See advertisapent of the Scient fic
American in another column. It is
an instrective and an interesting
paper whidh should be in the hands
of every scientist, artist and men
dc throughout our entire country. It
.containeevery week a vast amount
of interesting inforamation for the
snm of $8.00 a year., Address
Muna & Co., 361 Broadway, New
York.
The President commences his mes
sage by saying : "You are confront
ed at the threshold ef your legisla
tive duties, with a condition of the
national inances which imperatively
demands immediate and careful con
sideration. The amount of money
annually received, through the op
oration of present laws, from the
industries and necessities of the peo
ple largely exceed the sum necessary
to meet the expenses of the govern
nentL" The f'oregeing speaks well
for Mr. Cleveland's administration
and the Democratic party.
Johann Most, the ultra socialistic
editor and leader of anarchists of
New York City, was convicted on
last Monday, on the charge of incit
ing to riot, and will go to prison
again. Most talks most too much
for his own personal liberty, or for
the peace and good order of society.
Be is a Orebrand, and should be ef
fectually squelched from uttering his
fanatical and diabolical lhuuage
against law, religion, and republi
can institutions. Anarchy must be
throttled at once, or it will produce
a great deal of trouble and bloodshed
in the futare.-Ex.
The IYauss.secting.
Last Saturday the elements were
at war and the wind and rain had
seemingly conspired to drown and
destroy. The Democracy of old
Vermilion were also arrayed in their
war paint and drawn up in line of
battle. The cause of this unusual
commotion was whether or Dot our
great agricultural, educational gov
ernor, nature's vice-regent should be
endorsed and supported. The third
ward had been selected as the scene
of the decisive struggle, and both
parties, massed their forces at that
point. Despite the inclement weather
the court-house was full to overflow.
ing at 2 p. m., when W. A. White,
Esq., called the meeting to order
counseling a spirit of harmony and
good will. Mr. Gus Godchaux and
Mr. G. B. Shaw were then placed in
nomination for chairman by the
Nicholls and McEnery factions, re
spectively, and the former was elect
ed by a vote of 72 to 26. Mr. Shaw
then moved to make the election
unanimous. Mr. W. B. White was
then elected secretary.
The election of four delegates to
the parish convention being in order
R. C. Smedes, Dr. C. J. Edwards,
C. W. Felter and Eli Wise were
placed in nomination as Nicholls
delegates, and Messrs. N. C. Young,
Joseph J. Abadie, Evariste Trahan
and Dr. J. B. Ramsey by the Mc
Enery men. It being apparent that
the Nicholls ticket had a large ma.
jority, Mr. Shaw moved, while the
vote was in progress, to make the
election unanimous, and the motion
was carried with but one dissenting
voice.
A motion was then made and car
ried instructing the delegates to
oppose any and all nominations for
parish officers. After giving three
cheers for Gen. Nicholis the meeting
adjourned.
The Tensaw Brigade.
Tensas elected yesterday, or rath
er went through the form of sending
an "Africanized" delegation to the
Baton Routge Convention. With a
white population of 1571 in 1880,
and a total white vote of less than
400 she ought to be entitled to but
2 delegates on the basis adopted by
the State Central Committee. Yet
she claims 19. The whole State has
been apprised of the manner in
which.3800 alleged Democratic bal
lots were stuffed into the boxes in
that parish in 1884. In the Boatner
King contest the facts were all
developed, and the break of that
convention was due to the resistance
to participation in a Democratic
representative body based on such
frauds. It was not even pretended
that these votes were cast by any
voters, white or black. The whole
registration list was shoved into the
boxes, representing white and black,
Democrats and Republicans alike.
Will the Democratic party of the
State allow such representation in
the Baton Rouge Convention.--N.
0. Picayune, 5th inst.
When a faction of the Democratic
party of Louisiana gets so low down
as to allow a set of political trick
sters and office-seekers to pack pri
maries with a set of ignorant ne
groes, such as has been done at
Ouachita and Tensas, to further the
McEncry cause, we think it high
time for all good and thinking Dem
ocrats to withdraw from participa
ting in such diobolical schemes.
Whon such outrages are perpetra
ted openly and above board, how
can the people of Louisiana expect a
fair and impartial government at
the hands of such men if McEnery
should be elected governor again.
Surely, the time has come when
thinking men have to pause and re
flect.
Kaneas is trying to encourage silk
production, and has, by act of Legis
lature, established a station where
eggs will be distributed and reelers
educated. Ten acres have been set
out with mulberry trees, and fifteen
reels are now running, producing, it
is said. xcel!enit silk.
Railroad Matters.
In regard to the much desired road
to Abbeville the people seem to be
overcome by a Rip Van Winkle
sleep.- As far as they are concerned
capitalists and railroad managers
would never know there was such a
r place as Lafayette. While other
towns have energetic comniittees
visiting capitalists, and property
holders laying before them the ad
vantages of their towns and making
offers of bonuses, etc., Lafayette
floats gently along seeming content
with the business that comes to her
and desirous of nothing more.
LI Lafayette Advertiser.
When people become so blind and
indifferent as not to take advantage
of favorable opportunities to pro
mote their own interests and wel
fare, when presented to them in a
plain and unmistakable manner, they
can only blame themselves if such
shonld escape them and fall into
hands of others. The local press
have repeatedly pointed out the
many advantages to be derived in
having a railroad built from almost
any point on the Southern Pacific to
tlhis place, and why it is this subject
has received no more attention at
the hands of capitalists than it has,
is something remarkably strange to
us. There are three points on the
Southern Pacific by which a rail
road to Abbeville could be built
from, in a short time and at com
paratively small expense, Lafayette,
New Iberia and Jeanerette, and
which. a road from either place,
would be a safe and profitable in
vestment. We should not rely upon
foreign capital to come and build a
railroad for us, and for them to re
ceive all the benefits to be derived
therefrom, but we should build our
own and control it ourselves, which
can easily be done if we only have
unity of action. Let us, then, arouse
from our lethargy and grasp the
golden opportunity which is now
presented to us, and ere long you
will have cause to rejoice at the ac
tion thus taken. Our territory is
too valuable to remain longer in a
state of uselessness, then let us fill
it up with a class of good immi
grants that will bring thrift and
prosperity to each and every one.
We have the country to enrich every
industrious and 'frugal person living
in it, then why not take advantage
of the opportunity and have a rail
road running to this place at once.
The President's Message.
A special to the N. 0. States, from
Washington City of the 6th, says
President Cleveland's message to
the Fiftieth Congress was delivered
at 1:10 p. m. to-day. The President
does not touch upon the minor de
tails of goverment, and has no rec
ommendation to make concerning
theni. Even our foreign relations
are not touched upon. The President
confines himself to the tariff ques
tion, which he discusses in a confer
vative manner, and he recommends
the reduction of the surplus in the
treasury by increasing the free list,
and reducing the tariff on other ar
ticles. The workings of the "trusts"
are shown up, and the assertion
made that the tax on tobacco and
whisky, both being luxuries is not a
burden. It is yet too early to say
how the message will be regarded
by Republican Senators and Repre
settatives; but that the Democrats
will adopt the recommendations of
the President goes without saying,
and if the tariff is not -revised at this
session it will be because the Repub
lican Senate refuses to co-operate
with the Democratic House. The
President has had no colerences
with the great Democratic leaders,
and there no longer remains any
doubt that the platform adopted bh
the next Democratic convention for
the nomination of a Democratic
President will be, so far as the tariff
question is concerned, substantially
the same as the message presented
to Congress to-day b, AMr. Cleve
land. It is the opening of the
Presidential Campaign, and the
slogan of the Democratic hosts is
"Tariff Reform."

radius of fifteen miles in every direc

Political Pointers.
The McEneryites have been sorely
defeated in this parish.
To oppose the renomination of the
present governor is to raise your
parricidal band to destroy the Demo
crat institutions of the State ! Sheol!
--Shreveport Democrat.
"Hail to the chief who routed
advances," is the title of a new
Ring song just published. It may
"hail" now, but it will ke h--ll on
election day.-N. 0. News.
The negro buildozer, Samuel D.
McEnery, Lad to call on his sable
friend to carry Ouachita. Bitter
shame on the men who have African
ized the parish--Arcadia Record.
It is rumored that Gov. McEnery
will not go before the convention,
hut will resign in favor of Gen.
Beham, of New Orleans. We hope
he will stands bravely before the
house and hear his defeat like a
man.--Trinity Herald.
With exception of the Review,
every Republican paper in the State
edited by white persons is support
ing McEnery. We hear they have
been promised the publication of the
election proclamations, etc. A short
time will tell if it is so.-Morgan
City Review.
t A close calculation of the votes
cast to this date for delegates to
the State nominating convention,
shows the wonderful fact that the
popular majority among the white
voters is four to one in favor of
t Gen. Nicholls, and that McEnery
has not carried a single delegation
by a majority of white voters.
Lake Charles Commercial
McEnerv men have been dicharg
ed in this parish for daring to ex
ercise the privilege of voting for the
man of their choice. This is re
form. Democracy.-Iberville South.
Nicholls men have been refused
employment on public works in this
parish for the reason that they had
the courage to express their opin
ions and name their choice. This
is not reform Democracy.--Plaque
mines Protector.
The Times-Democrat is getting
ready for a bolt, as its dditorisls
indicate. We have feared all along
that the Ring would not abide by a
decision of a Democratic convention.
The course of the McEnery men in
St. James, Tangipahoa, Webster,
Grant, Lafayette and other parishes.
indicates what their course will be
when they find themselves -in al
hopeless minority at Baton Rouge.-
Poineer of Assumption.
Point us out an nncontest al
parish, where white Democratic
voters predominate, that has gone
for MeEnery. Not a single one. If'
left to the white people of this
State, Nicholls would beat Me~nea-y
three to one--not because Nicholls
has not as many friends among the
colored people as McEnerv, but be.
cause the colored vote in black
parishes is controlled by M4cEnery
men.-Alexandria Town Talk.
The Times-Democrat of Novem
ber 29th laid the foundation for a
McEnery bolt in case it should;hap
pen that the McEnery faction fail to
get control of the temporary organi
zation of the State convention. It
is patent to a blind man up a tree
why the overseers qnd ringmasters
will not submit to bite primaries-
they know without the influence
given them by the use of the negro,
their power in the community would
vanish.-Ouachita Telegraph.
The McEneryites carried Acadia f
parish last Saturday by concentrat- 5
ing all their strengh on certrin polls t
in the eastern part of the parish t
that had a small majority of the t
delegates of the parish, and they *
elected those delegates by small
majorities. The majority of the
number of votes cast in thi entire
parish was against them; so the peo
ple of the parish are still for
Nicholls, and if delegates had been
voted for by the parish at large, a *:
Nicholls delegation would have been 1i
elected.-St. Landry Democrat.
Ouachita, the home of Governor
McEnery, elected a McEnery delega- -
tion by the aid of the darkey's vote,
despite a protest of a large num
ber of whit- men, who refused to 2
vote or ,ttend the meeting, and
protested against Ouachita being
represented by delegates selected by 1,
darkies. Gov. McEnery's friends P
do not believe in white supremeacy
when white supremacy means that
Gov. McEncry must go. The blus
ter of Gov. McEnery about white
supremacy is very thin, and such an
argument is not for "home consutm -
tiou."--Pioueer of Assumption. 'p
