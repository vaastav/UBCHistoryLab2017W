TO BE SENTENCED THURSDAY
Defense Will Attempt to Secure the
Setting Aside of Verdict—Jury Stood
Eleven to One for Conviction on the
first Ballot—Prisoner Shows Effects
of Strain.
Herkimer, N. Y„ Dec. 5.—The jury
the trial "of Chester E. Gillette for
'j' the murder of his sweetheart, Grace
Brown, at Big Moose Lake, on July
11, at midnight returned a verdipt of
guilty in the first degree.
Sentence will be pronounced on
-Thursday morning, to which time court
•adjourned after the jury had reported.
Former Senator Mills, Gillette's coun
sel, before adjournment announced
that when court reconvened at 10
cVclock Thursday morning he would
jstnove to have the verdict set aside.
The jury which had deliberated for
five hours sent word at 11 o'clock that
a verdict had been reached. A moment
later they filed into the court room,
and at 11:15 o'clock an officer who
had been cent for G:.llette returned
with the prisoner.
Pale and a trifle nervous, apparent
ly. Gillette faced the Jury, and when
-'"Marshall Hatch, the foreman, declared
that a verdict of guilty in the first de
gree had been found, the youthful
prisoner gave no sign of emotion. A
few moments later, when his counsel
•had announce^his purpose of making
a formal motion that the verdict be
set aside, and the judge was dismiss
ing the jury, Gillette bent over a near
by table and picking up a pencil wrote
something upon a sheet: of paper. He
then folded the paper carefully and
placed it in his pocket. Immediately
JaK.. afterwards he was taken back to his
cell In the jail.
It weas learned that, the jury had
some difficulty in reaching an agree
ment and six ballots were taken 'be
fore the twelve men agreed. Up to
•that time the jury had .-stood eleven, for
conviction and one for acquittal.
The day's session until the judge's
'charge was taken up ly District At
torney Ward, who described the friend
ship of Gillette and Grace Brown and
their companionship up to the time of
the girl's death. For the first time dur
^ng the trial, the prisoner broke down
.as he was mercilessly scored by the
..prosecutor.
For some time he glared defiantly at
the district attorney, but when the lat
ter read abstracts from, the letters sent
Gillette by his sweetheart, the prisoner
buret inte tears and at times thruout
the remainder of the 8e99ion sobbed
convulsively.
When the Jury went to its room and
Gillette was led back to his cell, he
asked the deputy, "Are the doors all
locked, sheriff?" Apparently he feared
violence, but there was no evidence of
any Intention of violence on the part
of the big crowd that swarmed the
court room. After supper the court
room filled quickly and many remain
ed long, hoping to witness the return
mi the jury.
In his charge Judge Devenhorff said:
"This is a case of great importance.
You have no right to tie influenced or
controlled by anything but the evidence
as it has been presented you and the
law governing it as given you by the
court. Tou have no right to permit
either sympathy or favor with_one or
Ik* other party, to sway your judg
tnent.
None of us was present on the
eleventh of July, when it is said this
crime occurred. The evidence that
Grace Brown lost her life at Big Moose
Lake admits of no doubt. But there
is no testimony on the part of the peo
ple as to an eye-witness, as to what
occurred at the fatal moment, other
than the defendant, to detail the last
scene in the alleged tragedy. But all
evidence is more or less circumstan
tial, whether consisting of facts which
permit the inference oC the guilt or
whether given by an eye-witness.
Gentlemen, evidence is not to be dis
credited, or decried because it is cir
cumstantial. It may often be more
reliable evidence than direct evidence.
Gillette's Mother Stands by Son.
Herkimer, N. Y., Dec. 5.—Chester E.
Gillette, who last night was founc
guilty of the murder of Grace Brown,
today received a telegram from his
mother, "Mrs. P. S. Gillette, of Denver.
The mother urged her son to have
courage and trust in God, adding she
had wired the attorneys to appeal the
case. She promised she and his father
Would be at Chester's side when his
next trial took place.
JURIST KILLS HIMSELF.
Judge Webber, Prominent Minnesota
Lawyer, Commits Suicide.
New Ulm, Minn., Dec. 5.—Former
fudge B. F. Webber, considered one of
the most brilliant men at the Minne
sota bar, committed suicide yesterday
by hanging. Fear of the poorhouse, al
tho his wealth was estimated at $100,
000, drove the Jurist to take his lifs.
Large medical bills for the treatment
cf his wife, who has leen a paralytic
for years, led the former judge to be
lieve that hi? accumuiations of years
©f ardous work on bench and at the
fear would be dissipated shortly.

guest of honor at a banquet Friday
night, tendered him by the Brown

long service on the woolsack, from
which he resigned only a few weeks
ago. Leading attorneys from all parts
of Minnesota were to have been pres
ent.
Former Judge Webber had been
downcast ever since he .resigned his
judgeship last month. He intimated
frequently to friends tint he would be
beter off dead. The loss of his salary
as judge, together with his wife's con
tinued illness, and its attendant ex
pense, weighed heavily upon him.

Who Turned State's Evidence, on the
Stand.
Chicago, Dec. 5.—The court room in
which the trial of Cornelius P. Shea,
charged with conspiracy, is being con
ducted was almost stormed today by
a crowd of men eager to impart evi

necessary to control the throng.
Albert Young, whose cross examina
tion was finished yesterday, was re
called today and for nearly two hours
the attorneys argued regarding the ad
missability of certain questions, which
the state desired to ask him. The couft
finally ruled against the state, and
Young was excused.

he stopped about ten wagons ijv one
day. He "mentioned the men now on

FRENCH VIEW OF MESSAGE.
Petit Parisien Declares President Ac
centuates His Efforts for Peace.
Paris, Dec. 5.—The morning papers
generally do not comment upon Pres
ident Roosevelt's message to the Amer
ican congress, but they give to It the
most prominent place on their pages
and publish dispatches from New York
recording the feeling of dissatisfaction
over the president's reference to the
San Francisco situation.
The Petit Parisien says the presi
dent accentuates his continued effort
for peaqe and justice by discounten
ancing the attitude of the people of the
Pacific coast.
"President Roosevelt's clear vision
and knowledge of present conditions
render him circumspect: he is the only
man in the United States capable of
causing the violent spirits to reflect."

LAND FRAUDS IN KANSAS.
Speculators and Ranchmen Work
Scheme to Get Property.
Topeka, Kan., Dec. 5.—Speculators
and ranchmen have committed fraudu
lent practices in entering school lands
in western Kansas, according to the
record filed here yesterday with the

it is said, has been in the exorbitant
appraisement of lessees' improvements.
Jt appears the speculators and ranch
ers have leased lands and built small
shanties or dug outs on them, then
fenced the property. When it camc tims
to sell the land, appraiser's recommend
ed by the lessee would then bid and get
(he lund. No outside bidder would try
to make an offer since he would have
to pay for improvements which were
not on the land. It has been found that
fences around a ten thousand acre tract
of ranch land was charged as improve
ments on one forty acre tract of school
land which had been leasfcd.

The Thirty-first general assembly
will not be asked for any extraordin
ary appropriations for the state col
lege at Ames. Informally this matter
has been considered by the college of
ficers, and a meeting of the board of
trustees will be held some time this
month to determine what shall be in
cluded in the askings The chief thing
desired Just now is money with which
to complete the tunnels for the'steam
pipes to run from the new heating
plant in process of construction to the
various buildings. It is also desired
that there shall be some provision for
an addition to the dormitory for girls.
In other respects the needs of the col
lege are small.
The Thirtieth general assembly gave
the college only $77,500 for the year, in
addition to the mileage taxes and the
support fund. This was for hooks,
good roads, equipment, dairy barn, ad
ditional land, cataloging and experi
ment work in various lines. The mill
age tax which nets $125,000 a year, was
continued another five-year period.
The new central building, which is
now being used, cost upwards of $400,
000, of which $130,000 came from direct
appropriations. The new engineering
hall cast $218,000, of which $85,000
came from direct appropriations. About
$90,000 has been invested in a barn and
a dairy building.
The Thirtieth general assembly ap
propriated $54,500 for a heating plant
and tunnel. A part was spent for this
purpose, and the location of the heating
plant was changed, since which it has
been huilt. The Thirty-first general
assembly declined to appropriate for
the tunnel, and this remains to be pro
vided for.
In the meantime the new agricultur
al hall has been commenced and this
will cost at least $250,000. Altho the
last legislature did not make any ap
propriation to supplement the mlllage
"tax for this building the work is pro
ceeding well along, and this will use
up the proceeds of the millage tax for
the next two years.
The report of the special committee
of the last legislature on the state col
lege, as made last February, showed
that' the annual support fund of the
college, from all sources, had at that
time been increased to $238,500 annu
ally. It is not probable there will be
any additional increase in this sum
from the coming-general assembly.

years of age, travelworn and looking
like a common hobo, came into they
£avenport police station yesterday af
ternoon and asked to be locked up,
stating that he had committed a crime
and was ready to pay the penalty.
The police were not used to this
new fad of the wayward class and
they refused to believe his story until
he told it in detail and in such a
straightforward manner that there
seems to be no doubt as to its authen
ticity.

Special to Times-Republican.
Des Moines, Dec. 5.—Oregon, Mls»
souri. 111., Nebraska, Indiana, Wisconsin,
Louisiana, Michigan, California, Iowa,
South Dakota and Minnesota, all were
represented In the city by noon with
one or more delegates to the senatorial
convention. Thirty or more1 delegates
were present aside from the full dele
gation from Iowax Indiana also has a
full delegation. r*-J
It developed early that a strong Sen
timent against calling a constitutional
convention exists among the delegates
from other states, they agreeing with.
Governor Larrabee that a constitu
tional convention might have power to
open up the entire question of the con
stltution, including other questions as
well as the,election of senators. Sen
timent favors a congress proposing tha
amendment, cayying for the election of
senators by popular vote.
A reception will be given Thursday.
night and a banquet Friday night.
Governor Cummins, after welcoming
the delegates, said that the controversy
over the method of selecting United
States senators was started with tile
first constitutional convention and
had been in progress ever since.
He declared that the methods of se
lecting the members of the lower
house had been settled right and for
that reason had never been questioned,
but that the methods of selecting mem
bers ff the upper house had been in
controversy ever since, because the
method was wrong. In brief the gov
ernor said:
'1 do not question the wisdom of th«
acts of the members of that first con
stitutional convention for It is a mar
vel that they were able to agree at all
and give us such a masterful produc
tion. The decision on the method of
selecting senators was a concession to
two elements—first, to those who were
in favor of a government by stages
rather thtm by the people, and second,
to those who did not trust the people
for government. The reasons for the
method have long since passed &way.
There Is no more sense in electing
United States senators by the legisla
tures than there would, be in proposing
to elect members of the house of rep
resentatives by the legislature, or in
the proposal to elect legislators by
the supervisors of the various coun
ties."
The governor closed by saying that
the purpose of the present convention
is to bring the constitution within' the
harmony of the spirit of the timps. He
did not consider or discuss the advis
ability of any particular course for th®
convention to follow.

and altho he is wounded in several
other places, the wound in the .leg is
the most painful.
