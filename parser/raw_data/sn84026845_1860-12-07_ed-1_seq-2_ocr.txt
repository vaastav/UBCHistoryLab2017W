The President's Message Um been pcetty
eitessiv^y read here as elsewhere, and is j
tbe 'subject -of roach discussion. Most'
people are in the condition of tbe patriotic ?
Wigi&iH, who remarked day before yester
day, in the Senate, that the more he read
tbe message tbe less be comprehended it.
That part of the document relating to our
present Rational troubles is not nntike the
fiuaons expression in Taylor's message,
that "we were at peace with all the world
and tbe rest ?f mankind." Mr. Buchanan
makes it appear that the secession move
ment is not justifiable, and while he de
nies tbe right, be endorses tbe menace of
di8onton,-and promises the seceding States
that the power of the Federal Government
cannot be need against them. He asks:
''Has'tbe Constitution delegated to Con
gress the power to coerce a State into sub
mission which is attempting to withdraw,
or has actually withdrawn, from the Con
federacy? If answered in the affirmative,
itmu*J>e on theprmciple that tin.power hat
been conferred upon Cohtjre*i to declare and
to mate *oar agaaat a Slate. After much
serions reflection, I have arrived at the
conclusion that no such power has been
delegated to Congress, or to any other de
partment of the Federal Government."
W*r has nothing to do with it. It is a
question between the State and the Fed
eral Government of obedience to tbe Fed
eral Laws. As is remarked by an ex
change before us, "it is the duty of all
individuals to obey those laws, and the
State has no authority to release them
from such obedience, because the Federal
Constitution, and the laws made in pursu
ance thereof, are expressly declared by the
Constitution itself to be the supreme law
of the land?"anything in the Constitu
tion or Jaws of any State to the" contrary
notwithstanding." The Government has
precisely tbe same power to enforce every
law of Congressin South Carolina, that it
has to enfore the Fugitive Slave law In
Massachusetts. Mr. Buchanan does not
invoke the war making power in the one
case?why should he in the other?"
Tbe only question it seems to us is as to
the policy or the wisdom of exercising tbe
power of coercion. Tbe wisdom and the
patriotism of the country will be divided
upon this. The power may be surrendered
but it cannot be denied.
The Philadelphia American has a review
of the message, from which we take the
following:
The argument which the President puts
forth in regard to the right to resist a con
stitutional election is sound, and liis state
ment that tbe very position of the chief
executive renders him conservative is also
soanil'atid jnst. .Apprehensions that Mr.
Lincoln will invade the rights of any sec
tion are not justified by his past history,
and on a mere"contingency of such danger
it is most unwise.breakup tbcUniouaud
to wrqck the fortunes of the south first of all.
Tbe President says there is no single act of
Congress or law in existence impairing, in
tbe slightest degree, the rights of the South
in their' peculiar property. There is no
probability of. the passage of such a law,
he says, and, were such a law enacted the
Supreme Court), stands as a barrier strong
enough to overthrow any such legislation.
The act of the Legislature of Kansas, Mr.
Buchanan declares, will be declared a
nullity by the Supreme Court if ever test
ed. Even the State laws, if any such ex
ist, tending to obstruct the operation of
the Fugitive Slave law, are equally harm
less before the Supreme Court. Mr. Bu
chanan does not presume that tbe incom
ing President will violate his duty. What
stronger argument can be made against tbe
justice of the present position of the se
cessionists than this? It is satisfactory
and complete. It is the truth, and we
thank Mr. Buchanan for stating it, as it
was his duty to do.

Tnu President's Message, if we may
credit the Btatoments of some of the cor
respondents at Washington, is not receiv
ed with much favor by cither Southern or
Northern members. Wo copy a paragraph
or two from the correspondence of the N.
Y. Herald of yesterday:
Southern Senators declare the Message
to be weak, vacillating, inconsistent and
untrue.
The Northwestern democrats may give
support to some of the President's views,
but the republicans oppose it in toto.
Northern democratic Senators, includ
ing Bigler, Bright, Gwin, and others,
friends o'f the administration, regard it as
Vreakand calculated to precipitate events -
on the Sobthern border States. '
Senator Savis,'in conversation with a
gentleman, after reading that doenment,
said that Mississippi did not intend to leave
until the 4th of March, but that now she
would go out on the 8th of January.
Mr. Iverson, of Georgia, entertains the
tame views as SenatorDavis.
Gov. Fltzpatrict. of 'Alabama, says, that
the Message will rather precipitate action
iu the cotton Statfes,'and does not believe,
that anything which Congress may do can
avert a d^^ptijm JoCslayAhilrevotatjSh.

Mt letter closed yesterday after that por
tion of the Message relating to the trou
bles in jhe Sooth had been read and te^
fore' the other details"hacT"been finished.
Aftert-carne back from mailing it. at the
over.,, to theSeaate
to pee yrhat were the effects , of the Presi
dent's document on that body., -Senator
Clingman, cf X." C., was spea'kinjf as I went
in. Thi$ gentjeman.yon will have noticed,
is a candidite^ ah*d "a very anxious one,
too, before the jforth Carolina Legislature,
now in session, for re-election. He has
already received the caucns nomination of
his party, (the Democrats) but tbev have
resolved to wait for the issue of events in
the Sonth before they go into an election.
Mr. Clingman evidently feels the suspense
of his position at home, and so-yesterday,
in the face of universal desire, of admitted
propriety, and I might say t>f decency it
self, be got up and expressed his dissent
from the President's views in that he (the
President) hid' not met'the requisitions of
the South. It was as low a partisan har
angue as yon would ever hear on the
stump, and I have heard ho one who heard
it express himself otherwise. As soon as
he. Had finished, Senator Crittenden al
most sprung from bis seat and at once had
the recognition of the Chair. No sooner
was the venerable bnt stalwart form of the
no We old Kentuckian discried'by the gai
leries, than tbev rose as one'man and
stooping overYach other's shoulders, they
listened with bated breath for the scathing
rebuke which they knew was coining. And
they were uot disappointed either: forit did
come. Senator Crittenden said he had
heard scarcely one word fe'l from tbelipsof
the North Carolina Senator which he could
commend, and he hoped that the bad ex
ample which he had set would not be fol
lowed -by any other Senator. It was with
the greatest difficulty that a perfect out
break of applanse all roond the galleries
could be suppressed. The eye3 of most
every man and woman in all the spacious
galleries, looked a "God bless the old pat
riot." One man, sitting near me, spoke
out, and said that he did not believe that
tha officers of the Senate ougbt to be al
lowed to restrain the enthusiasm of the
people. In concluding his few and point
ed remarks, Senator Crittenden turned
round and, looking witheringly in the face
of Clingman, said : "Sir, shall this proud
government of ours?tbe noblest ever
devised?which was the glory of our fath
ers, become the shame and condemnation
of U3, their unworthy descendants ?"?
?Wlieri'Mr. Crittenden sat down, Clingman
arose to say something in extenuation and
qualification of his remarks, but the Sen
ate was in no temper to listen to him fur
ther, and Hale, of Kew Hampshire, moved
an adjournment, which was unanimously
carried.
Coming back to the House, I find all
bands going it on a motion to refer so
much of the message as related to the
state of tbe country, to a special commit
tee of one from each State, that one to be
chosen by his delegation. Ashley, from
the Toledo district, Ohio, to his disparage
ment he it recorded, was the first one who
voted againsttbe reference. Bingham,from
the ^Cadjz fiistfictj followed him. Your
neighbor, Theaker, a? was;his duty, voted
for the Vfife'retice. Tbe fire-eaters of the
rabid sort, inrcompany, with Ashley, Bing
ham, and - that school, -voted also against
the reference. When Porcher Miles, of S.
C., was called, he got up and verv glibely
said that it made but little difference how
he and his colleagues voted; his State was
out of the Confederacy, and there was no
use in voting. Pugh, of Ala.~ got up and
said bis State was going to follow suit,
and there was no use in his delegation vo
ting either. Ten of his delegation got up
and Rebuked him right on tbe spot, by vo
tingrfor the reference. The telegraph has
apprisedyon that the motion was carried
by nearly a three-fourths vote. Great
hope3 are entertained of this Committee,
and a good deal rtore buoyancy was db
scrvable among Union men, lust night, at
the hotels,-although the secession feeliug
was , nothing daunted'; but only the more
determined. As an instance of this last,
1 may mention to you a scene that occur
red at Brown's?the headquarters of the
ultra cockade gentlemen. Some of-.those
fiddlers jtpd .harpers that frequent places
of public resort in all cities, came in and
struck up the "Marsellaies," and played it
well. Soon they had a crowd of about
twenty "rosettes" around them, all about
half drunk, and fnll of demoniac patriot
ism. They made the room hideous with
the vehemeut discording of their chorus.
In the midst of the "finish," high above
tbe rest, one fellow yelled ont, "liberty
or death is a d?d hnmbugj sing a cot
ton confederacy or death." At the con
clusion three cheers were given for a
Southern republic, the re-opening of the
Slave trade, and Jeff: Davis as President.
C.
Iiie St. Louis Republican describes the
mode of treatment adopted in q case of
diptberia, at a hospital hi that. city. The
complaint at first yielded readily to the,
local application of a strong solution of
nitrate of silvei, mild mercurial cathartics,
and a blister on the nape of the'neck.
After exposure, tho disease became worse,
the former treatment failed of relief, and
the only-hope was to open the windpipe
below tbe larynx. When the opening was
thade into tho wind-pipe, there was an
immense gush of mucus, mixed with shreds
bf the false membrane,- which was blocking
up the tracha and larynx. A silver tube
was at once placed in theopening, through
which the-mucus and lymph continued to
escape, until now his, ..recovery is placed
beyond a doubt.
