The Secretary of War, in a dispatch
•o Major General Dix, bearing date of
tEie 19th, says "a call and draft for 300,
000 troops, to make up the deficiency
#ccasioned by credits on the last call,
has been ordered by the President.
Barkis is willin'," if the men are
needed. It is just what ws expected,
•nd what ws told the people when they
were running their legs off, last sum
mer, to see if their localities hadn't fur
Bished mors men than had been called
for. We told you, when you wsrs beg
ging to ks credited with an sxcess of
troops to avoid ths last draft, that the
Government wantsd men, and not cred
its, and that if you didn't furnish thsm
thep, you must in ths future. The QOT
•rnment thsn called for 500,000 men.—
The oountry responded with 200,000
drafted men, substitutes and bounty
junipers, and 300,000 credits. Our Ad
jutant General, with the best intentions,
sent agents all over ths west to hunt up
oredits. The official* of other States
did the same thing, only mors so. A
light draft was made, and the people
settled down under the belief that they
had dischorged their duty in the prem
ises. But, gentlemen, credits for 1801
won't fight ths battles of 18*15. The
Government wants men. We tell it to
take them by draft—though if the peo
ple think they can spare the money, let
them offer bounties. Whatever you do,
don't go round hunting credit* with
which to put down the rebellion. As
the draft is imminent, now is a good
time for veterans to enter Hancock'*
new corps, receive their $300 Govern
ment bounty and such local indue
menu us the people may offer to place
thu county out of ths draft. The corps
muet be filled by January l»t.
Tfe* B*v*eatioa of Urn. Dix** IiTnldk
Ord«r.
When the intelligence of the release
of the iuvaidera of St. Albans reached
Gen. Dix, that officer at once iasued an
order directing his subordinates"in case
further acta of depredation and murder
are attempted by marauders, or persons
commissioned at Richmond, to shoot
them down or if itbe necessary with a
•iew to their capture, to cross into Can
ada, and pursue them." Of course we
know nothing of the President's reasons
for directing the revocation of this or
der, but we cannot believe his action
was prompted because an invasion of
Canada under the circumstances men
tioned by Gen. Dix could not be justi
fied by international law and precedent.
Mr. Lincoln evidently desires to have
as few irons in the tire as possible and
if he hb all succeed in the future as in the
past, in steering clear of foreign im
broglios and fuily sustaining our na
tional honor, he will add new lustre to
his administrative ability. We appre
hend that Gen. Dix was fully advised of
the law that would apply in Jthe event
of the execution of his order.
'One of America's ablest commenta
tes upon law, Chancellor Kent, lays
down the following well established
principles, relative to the acts of bellig
erents on neutral territory: "That no
proximate acts of war are in any man
ner to be allowed to originateon neutral
ground. No act of hostility
to be commenced on neutral ground.
No measure is to be taken that will lead
to immediate violence. The neutral is to
carry himself with perfect equality be
tween both belligerents, giving neither
the one nor the other any advantage
and if the respect due to to neutral ter
ritory be violated by one party without
being promptly punished by just ani
madversion, it would soon provoke a
aimilar treatment from the other party,
arid the neutrai ground would become
the theater of war. No bellig
erent power can claim the right of pas
sage through a neutral territory, unless
founded upon a previous treaty, and it
cannot 6c granted by a neutral, where
there id a
a antecedent treaty, UNLESS
Jiat EyUALiry Oi'PKIVUiOE BK AWJOWED
YOBOTH ilELLIGKKKNTS."
fhe language we have quoted i^'thai
'of.uu English judicial tribunal. Eng
4aiid Luis thus established a precedent,
atul furnished the law for just such a
piroee'j'iiULj us the order oi' Gen. Dix con
templated. The Jit. Albans raider.,
claimed to have acted under commit
-simis »sued by the Richmond govern
ment, recognized as a belligerent power
by Great Briuan. The Canadian being
neutral, were bound to carry themselves
with perl'tcl equality between tiie Con
federates and our government, giving
neither any advantage. If, however,
the agenta and troops of the Richmond
belligerent "violate the respect due to
English neutrality,''and that neutrality
fail to punish promptly such belliger
ents, then neutral ground is liable to be
the theater of war, for if there be no
treaty between Davis and England, "an
equality of privilege to pass through
neutral territory must be allowed to
both belligerents."
Tne order of Gen. Dix was based up
-on the soundest principles of interna
tional law, and we regret that it has
been rescinded. Until the Canadian au
thorities give our government assuran
ces of honest friendship, andco-operate
with us in preventing the depredation:
of cut-throats and thieves who make
Canada an asylum and refuge, as well
as a base of pretended military opera
tions, we want to see the dignity oi
American manhood asserted and main
49tyj^d. Let us not humble ourselves
'\vhen we know we are right, and our
enemies confess to be in error. If Can
ada is to be made the base of rebel oper
ations upon our territory not in rebel
lion and which the rebels do not claim,
and our cU.es and towns arc to bt
burned, property stolen and citizens
.murdered, then we say let the Araeri
can government march its troops and
claim "e ual privileges with its swo r,
enem.os, on neutral soil. We baiie% i
Jh mild conciliatory spirit toward
our friend*, but if they persist in givin
aid and undue advantage to our eno
ttkies, while wearing the cloak of friend
ship, lot us be men, and not cravens
and dare to tell them ot their liypocr
#y, and our determination to maintak
our rights at all hazards. Let tho Ca
nadian authorities give the rebel raid
•rs notice to quit their territory and en
force their will, or else let the rescinded
irder of Gen. Dix be re-to&ued and car
ried into execution.
TAX Mi MM.
chandise, 4c., from which he estimates
a revenue of $55,000,000 the present
year.
Many merchant* complain of this
V tax upon sales, or one upon profits,
comes from the consumer and not from
ihe dealer. If we purchase an invoice
•f paper wesxpectthe sale tax to be
added to the purchase price. If fanner
V sells a load of wheat he must, under
ho proposed system, pay his sale tax,
ut ttie purchaser will have his margin,
nd he who eventually consumes that
vheat will find in the enhanced value
«f the flour, that h$ in reality pays the
ale tax. The consumers only are the
nervous to complain if there is reason
ior complaint, and even the consumer
'•as no reason to complain.
Our national debt exists and must be
aid. for we cannot repudiate. Better
e Utxvd high to-day and to-morrow
»nd be free from debt next week, than
o be for years paying high taxes and n
neavy debt still unliquidated.
Higk taxes will benefit the consumer
in st ill another way. Our national cur
reni-y is depreciated to its present value
•iot because gold is really and intrinsic
ally worth more, but but because the
people who issue it are heavily involv
ed in debt, and by a system of low tax
ation present* no immediate prospect
for its liquidation, while their expenses
arc annually increasing. Increase the
taxes to a point looking to an early re
deiiiptiou of our evidences of indebted
ue.—, ami our promises to pay, written
n :j"eenbacks, will appreciate in value.
Gold will ds*pr •ciate, and goods that are
now governed and controlled by tiicgolet
market will find their proper level. Ho
Ion. as war exists we cannot look for
pes e prices, but we can reduce prcseiu
speculative prices. Let us agree to sub
mit to a taxation, not oppressive, but
within our power to stand without be
in involved in bankruptcy, and the
•jottorn will soon fall from the tub o:
•{old and other heartless speculators.—
What ws want is to exhibit a disposi
tion to pay our debts, and our outstand
ing obligations will be worth more.

General Foster's operations on the
Charleston v Savannah Railroad are de
tailed
by the Jl-raid's correspondent on
the SAli. Tiie whole arirty was advanced
to within 200 yards of tbe road, to cover
tho operations of a large working parly i
from the 55th Massachusetts, who were
sent to cut down a loiest, so as to open a
range for our artillery. The rebels used
the embankment for a breastwork, anel
heavy skirmishing ensued. Soon al
signal was given that the 55th had ac-1
complisheel their work, and our forces
were withdrawn. This the rebels look
for a repulse, and rushf-d forward with a
yell. They paid dear for their rashness,
it-, ut the proper time they were received
with a withering fire, and soon after-j
wards retreated. Our line was then re
sinned, with skirmishers in sight of the
railroad.
Our artillery has command of the
ad through a winrow, maele in the
woods by our men. Among the guns in
position are some 30-pounder Parrots.

supjjort, fed the order was given, when
his gallant divislpn marched at double
t{uick, penetrated the abattis surround
ing the work,., nlunged through the
ditch and scaled tne parapets of the fort,
ten feet In height, and swarmed into
the works under a not fire, which,while
it cut down many, faileel to chcck the
advance, and the work was ours.. Most
of the garrison, bewildered ly the suel
den sweep of our veterans, surrendered
in haste, nut others stood by their guns
and fought until they were cut down.—
Net over three minutes elapsed after
our veterans leaped the parapet, ere
th?ir cheer* announced the work done
to the eager troops stretched around the
doomed city.
Our captures were 200 prisoners, twen
ty-one heavy guns and large quantities
of ordnance, subsistence and supplies,
besides an open port, through which
Gen. Sherman can draw all his supplies.

A good deal of heavy firing has been
going on at Dutch Gap canal during the

In front of Petersburg the enemy a
day or two ago opened a new one hun
etred pounder gun, and have been indus
triously engaged in throwing shells at
railroad trains as they pass a certain
point of the road in full view of their
gunners, but they have done no damage
whatever, nor are they likelv to elo so
unless they show more aecuracy in their
firing.
This morning a salute of 100 guns was
fired in honor of the great victory of
Thomas over Hood. The rebels sullenly
threw a few shells in rapidly, but they

the line were very active, keeping upan

N uw YORK, Dee- 21.—The morning
papers have nothing from Sherman.
Thei/iraW's City Point correspond
ent of the 17th says The notorious
rebel scout, Sergeant Wm. E. Water
bury, of the North Carolina Cavalry,
was* moruiilv wounded last Thursday.—
Water bury has been long known to eiur
authorities as a vigilant, troublesome
seovit, with bravery enough to venture
into our camps and sagacity sullicient to
avoid detection anel olude pursuit. He
has infested Ihe country between James
river ant? our le-:t, beyond Petersburg all
Summer. All attempts to entrap him
have hitherto failed. Small parties
have been sent 111 his pursuit, but lie?
could not be overtaken or identified.—
lint a few weeks ago he came' to the
Wells' House, one morning before sun
rise, and seriously threatened the cap
ture of a safe-guard, within half range
of the Union forth, and said to he within
minnie range of General Meade's head
ejuarters.
It appears that Waterbury came to
our pickets dressed in Federal uniform,
representing himself as one of our sol
diers, and requested to be directed to liia
regiment. Contrary to his expectation,
a soldier wan sent with him as a guide
(Jii liis way he induced the guide to halt
and take a drink, when he seized hia
musket and maele him follow as pris
oner. At night he fell asleep while
guarding the union soldier, wiio in turn
seized the niuskei and shot him."
