JAMES L.
D. G. MERCHANTS
TOGUTDELIVERIES
"Impracticable for Washington at
this time." Is the way TL P. Andrews,
president of the Retail Merchants' As
sociation, today regards the snecea
tion of the economy board of the
Council of National Defense that one
regular delivery a day be established
as a maximum for retail stores
throughout the United States.
"Conditions in Washington would
not permit of such a radical step
right now," declared Andrews In an
Interview today. "Over 100.000 people
have been added to the population of
the Capital,-In the past few months.
ana more are coming- every aay. .Most
of them arrive here with only their
hand luggage. They have to set up
housekeeping, and they have to have
all sorts of furniture and household
necessities at once. Moreover the
Christmas shopping is now under uay
It would be impracticable at this time
to reduce deliveries to only one a
day.
"But I do think that deliveries
should be reduced to two a day. one in
the morning and one In the afternoon,
as I shall suggest to the merchants
of Washington at the meeting of the
Retail Merchants' Association Mon
day. -
"Great congestion exists in the
freight yards of Washington owing to
the inability of the transfer com
panies to handle incoming shipments.
Washington merchants make four de
liveries a day. Dy eliminating two
of them they can devote part of their
equipment to hauling their own
freight. This will do away with the
long lines of cars standing in the
yards waiting to be unloaded, and
will release cars -quickly for use.
Such a course might possibly aid in
doing away with th present embar
goes." LAST RITES FORJUSTICE

U. S. Combats Foe lairs.
Finding tiiat Germany Vas oulma
neuverlng all the allies and the
United States in malicious propa
ganda, this Government determined
on a definite campaign or education,
and to date has labored chiefly in con
verting Russia, Roumania, Austria.
and Switzerland to Americas side.
Perhaps the most startling attempt
of any- though not so labeled -was
the President's message to Congress
Tuesday. In this the President
sought to wean Austria from the
German side, as officials view It to
day. while at the same time h ap
pealed to !rman liberals to over
turn Hohen-eollernifm.
The Government has enlisted the
aid of banished Germans in Switzer
landmen who fai'or a republic
to help spread this doctrine into Ger
many, while, as In the past, allied
flyers will drop copies in German
over the Teuton trenches
Russian UllTlrultlri.
With the Russian situation the Ad
ministration has difficulty In com
munication, inasmuch as the Rolshe-
vikl control the main arteries out of.
Moscow and Pctrograd. However,
constant news matter -showing the
American lewpolnt is being sent to
Russia via France, and Is being dis
tributed as best It may. The Ameri
can military attaches, apparently act
ing under Embassador Francis in
dividual instructions, have under
taken independent propaganda there,
but apparently with boomerang re
sults. Switzerland, a hotbed of German
propaganda, was being flooded with
evil tales about American intentions,
but this has been offset by an official
communication to Switzerland, show
ing there will be, no overrunning of
Swiss neutrality. Meantime Rou
mania, apparently tending toward an
armistice with Germany, Is being
heartened by promises of American
aid and actual contributions in the
way of loans.
GERMAN CRUfSER SUNK

COPKMIAOEN. Dec. (!. A German
auxiliary cruiser, the Kuardship Hot
nia. has been blown up by a German
mine off the Island of Amaecr, ac
cording to survivors who have
reached Dracoer. They refused to
state how many men were lost. The
vessel is said to have been dolnc

mine.
The Holma was formerly a Rus
sian vessel which was captured by
the Germans.
