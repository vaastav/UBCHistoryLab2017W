The South nml the Weekly Republi
can
Every mall brings us most intelligent
and hopeful IcttcM from tho Southern
Stales showing clearly that thcro is to bo
n grand political upheaval in that section
Tho rovlval of national feeling is pro
gressing Tho Bourbon Democracy do
not look for an alliance with tho Repub
lican Administration Tho weather
beaten Bourbon Republicans nro aban
doning nllconfldcnco In tho influcnco of
Democratic Bourbons nt Washington
Delegations of Southerners nro horo from
nearly nil the Southern States and mon
of differing political antecedents
nro conferring togcthor for tho
overthrow of tho common onomy
Tho men who think they can longorkeop
alivo a political party based on regret at
tho preservation of tho Union tho aboli
tion of slavery and tho enfranchisement
of the blacks will gradually learn that
tho prcsont has attractions and that Na
tional citizonshlp is now valued as nover
before They will obscrvo that North
ornersarobccomlngtrustful ns they learn
that Southerners nro rcasonablo and pa
triotic But they will also learn that tho
old Democratic party cannot bo atnncs
ttod It is the ghost of tho confederacy
It is a rcmindor of trouble It lags
surporfluous on tho political stage
Tho Northern Domoorncy lias proven
unable to bo of any uso to tho South
Tho Southorn Democracy has boon of no
uso to anybody Tho Federal patronago
has kopt tho lattor on its legs since 1877
That nourishment it will hereafter lack
Tho liberality of Republicans will oxhlblt
itsolf in appreciation of thoso old oppo
nonts who now aid in putting tho Demo
cratic party out of tho way and not by
patting Bourbons on tho back
Tiik National Rkpuhlioan proposes
to commenco tho publication of a weekly
edition on tho 0th of January It hopes
with that weekly to penotrato every town
and settlement in tho great South It
will announco no doctrines not ncccpt
nblo to all anti Bourbons It will bo the
advocato of a great party for 1884 which
shall ombraco not only tjio Republican
party but all others who desiro to placo
tho Nation nbovo tho Stato and
to ovorthrow Southern Bourhonlsm
Our efforts in this direction liavo
not been fruitless All Virginia concodes
that this journal was a powerful nld to
tho noblo lendors of Liberalism in Vir
ginia It made tho North acquainted
with them and with their patriotic pur
poses Tho moro wo can circulato our
weekly edition through tho South tho
moro good seed wo can sow for futuro
political good Restoration has fairly
commenced To promote its progress is
now tho best political work that can bo
done
O110 Republican Party Only
With ono Republican party gaining re
cruits all tho timo from tho opposition
thcro is a certainty of success in tho
strugglo noxt year for a new Houso of
Representatives Willi two Republican
parties fighting each other instead of tho
enemy thero is a certainly of defeat in
that struggle
Tho courso of tho Administration is
rapidly trauquilizing tho party as it
lias tho country Tho order and
method nt tho Whito Houso nro
contagious All who sco tho resi
dent find him courteous independ
ent nnd direct Ho is a skillful pilot
and novor had pilot a stormier or moro
perilous task than had ho to get tho ship
of stato safely out of port Our country
Is going to bo interested in matters of
more concern than tho bandying of epi
thets between Republican factions Wo
hopo and believe that tho only Republi
cans who will bo looked on with disfavor
will bo thoso who disturb tho peace
Wo can seo n restored and united Nation
in 18S3 with no party in it sulking be
cause there is no confederacy and no
slavery But this cannot bo if wo havo
two Republican parties instead of one as
wo luwo had for ten years past
Tho organization of tho Houso gives
good earnest that friomlly contests aro
possible within tho party Tho great
prizo of tho SXukership was carried off
by tho choico of tho majority and no ono
lias seen any frowning faces becaufao of
it Tho cominitteessoou to bo announced
will no doubt bo so selected that no ono
will be ablo to say that power was used
ungraciously or dofcatcd candidates do
llied tho honorable posts usually assigned
to thorn Tho friendly association of
Republican Representatives with each
other during tho long session will it Is to
bo hoped promote something of tho old
timo fellowship which will bo by them
communicated to their constituencies
It is a long timo sinco tho party outlook
was so favorable ns now
Democrat hutted of Gcnoral Grant
Is something we cannot understand re
marks the truly good editor of a religious
weekly It might help our esteemed
contemporary to a clearer comprehension
of this problem If ho wero to apply his
leisure to tho study of natural history in
general and ornithology in particular
Ho would learn that in ancient days when
timo was young whon birds conversed ns
well as sung the vultures nover held n
convention cither district state or na
tional without formulating and adopting
a platform declaratory of tlicirimpliicifMb
hatred of tho engle But that proud bird
of the mountain did not permit either
his spirit or his feathers to bo milled on
account of vulturlno malice On the
contrary ho maintained his dignity in
serono grandeur treating the vultures
with silent contempt ns General Grunt
treats his defamers But tho vultures
hadnt sonso enough to appreciate tho
robuko nor do their Imitators feel as
wise men would under tho contempt of
a great nature
T111 menaced dissolution of Southern
solidity elicits an unusual display of
Democratic noise It Is ho steam in tliu
cylinder not that which comes out of tho
whistle that makes tho hhip go But the
Bourbon mind contemplates tho bright
noisy wliiBtlo with adegrco of admiration
only surpassed by its contempt for the
greasy and almost bllent cnglno
Bvtho timo 11 few moro credulous young
ladles nro victimized into iiiairiuguitnd
then lohbed nnd desoited by vouorablo
scoundrels it may occur lo tho friends of
mariiagcublo young ladies to iuquiio into
tho antecedents of a candidate for matii
monlal positions Such nn investigation
should tako precedenco of tho ollicintlng
clergyman
Tiinnu nro more claims now liofoio Con

and disposed of in three years if nothing
