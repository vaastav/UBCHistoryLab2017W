Horace "Walpole tells a story of the Duch
ess of Ituthland in her old age, which hits
so cleverly a great many of the newspapers
of the present day that wc cannot forbear to
repeat it. It is but short, and it were well
its moral were heeded at least by our coun
try friends:
"When the Duchess was told a bit of
flrangc news, she invariably said: 'Lucy,
child, step into the next room and set that
down.' 'Lord, madam says Lucyj 'it can't
b J true 1' 'Oh, no matter, child,' she replies
'it will do for news into the country by the
next post."'
So it is with a large proportion of the news
manufacturers of the present day. They
"put down" everything, true or false, for
" news into the country by the next jxst "
thinking, like the good old dowager, "it will
do." "Vc knew a person a few years ago,
who, being at a neighboring gathering on
a day .after a rain-storm over night, told the
following : " The first "thing I knew, I was
standing six hundred yards from the house,
a feather bed in my arms with six of the
children rolled up in it. Polly (my wife)
was carried the same distance, in the oppoitc
direction, with tho other six rolled up in the
coverlid. On looking around tho next
morning, I found that the roof of the houe
had been Liken off, carried tip, turned
around, and replaced in the same position.
I knew it was roversed by the stain from the
dirt chimney on the end opposite from where
it was.bcforc."
Cannot our brethren of the quill introduce
a little reform in this matter? Can they not
find time to look into and correct the state
ments which make up their papers ? If it
Ls impossible, in all things to arrive at the
exact truth can they not defcrthe publication
until the fact can bo ascertained? If wc
cannot "reform it altogether," let us, who are
so much dependent on each other, at least
reform it partially.

"Whatever theso papers may think of the

extraordinary circumstances, and with pre
conceived views of what the President ought
to have said, it may be accepted as a fact
that they all look to tho action of Congress

issue of whether Republican liberty shall en

I do not think it necessary for the mem

certificates of election after the two Houses
arc organized, which will then be a simple
question, under tho constitution of the mem
bers taking their scats. Each House must
judge for itself, the election returns and qual
ifications of its own members. As to what
the two Houses will do in reference to the
oath now required to be taken, before the
members can take their scats, is unknown to
me; and I do not like to predict. But upon
the whole, I am of opinion that it would be
better for the question to come up and be
disposed of after the two Houses havo been

During the war there was a large quanti
ty of tobacco stored in the city of Richmond,
which was claimed as the property of French
subjects who desired its removal, which
was prevented by tho Federal blockade of
all the Southern porU. It became, we be
lieve, of consideration and discussion be
tween the governments of France and the
United States. It is still often referred to in
tho newspapers. The following succinct
statement of all the facts in tho case, wc
tako from the Richmond Time :
1 he iSorthern papers arc constantly re
ferring to the "French tobacco," which was
stored hero during the whole period of tho
war, a part of which was destroyed, we le-
licvc, when Richmond was evacuated, and
tho rest wo have heard was seized by tho
Federal Government As none of the vari
ous accounts which wc have read of this to
bacco give any of the real facts with refer
ence to it, we will briefly state them, and as
they have been furnished by the gentleman
who represented the late Confederate States
in a protracted and important suit, having
for its object the sequestration of this very
tobacco, his statement may lc relied upon as
strictly correct and perfectly impartial.
For several years before the late civil war.
August Belmont, the well known banker of
Jcw ork, was the agent ot the "1'otlis-
child llrotliers" of 1 ranee, for the purchase
of loaf tobacco in lrginia. lhc.Iocal agent
of Belmont was a Mr. Jones, of this city, an
intelligent and experienced tobacco mer
chant, with deservedly high reputation for
?. T .1 1. 1. t
iniegriiy. uurmg me year which prcocucs
the commencement of hostilities between the
United States and the Confederate States,
Mr. Jones was instructed by Belmont to
purchaso for tho Rotluichild Brothers a large
quantity of Yirginm tobacco. The pur
chases wero made, and paid lor by isclmont
and at the time of the secession of Virginia
there were about three thousand hogsheads
of tobacco stored in tho warehouses of Rich
mond, which was the property of tho French
sulyects aforesaid.
Soon after the passage of the sequestration
act by the Provisional Congress of tho Con
federate States, one of the "Receivers" for
the Eastern District of Yirgina filed a peti
tion for the sequestration of the afonaid
tobacco, alleging that it was the property of
August JSelmont, an "alien enemy, resident
and having his domicil in New York." To
this petition, Jones, the agent of Belmont,
uicti an cjaooraic answer, uenving mai n was
really the property of the llothscltild Bro
thenu" He filed with his petition several
hundred letters of instruction from Belmont,
being the correspondence of some three or
four years, proving most conclusively that
Belmonthadno interest in the three thousand
hogsheads of tobacco, except as the agent of
yrcnchcitucns Thcro were, however tocli,
rii-il difficulties which prevented theRoth
!-child3 frora-irrtaTcni'ig forTCTeralmoriths
to defend their rights in tho. umteaeraic
District Court. Belmont, as an "alien ene
my," could not do.BO, and Jones, as the sub
agent of Belmont, was unable to offer as the
agent oi tne iiotntcniiua.
Tho liffipnltv was at last removed by M.
T-itil the Fn neh Consul for Virginia, ap-
nrarintr in court and claiming the privilege
which is invariably conceded in Courts of

of the nation of which he is the reprcscnta
'Flit a firrbt vrrva denied bv the Confed
erate district attorney, for the reason that
M. Paul had never taken out an exeauater
from the Confederate. Government, and wxs
therefore in, fact no Consul, as France had
not reoognixed the independence of the
Confederacy. The case was postponed for
flu. rudiment of this twint, when Mr. Judah
thn Confederate Secretary of
State, directed the attention of the Attorney
General of the Confederacy to the fact that
it was the bitcntion of the district attorney
to deny the Jriglit of M. Paul to appear as
French Consul, and protested against such a
step.
The District Attorney was then instructed
not to object to the appearance of M. Paul
as French Consul. The objection was, there
fnro nnt nressed. and M. Paul intervened in
behalf of the Rothschild Brothers with great
success. A commission to take certain depo
sitions in France was then issued, and when
the depositions were taken and returned to
the Court, the case was heard fully upon its
facts, Messrs. "William A. Macfarland and
Powhatan Roberts representing M. Paul and
the Rothschild Brothers, and Mr. P. II Ay
Ictt the Confederate Government.
The proof that the three thousand hogs
bends of tobacco was in reality the property
of the Rothschild Brothers, and not that of
August Belmont, was overwhelming, and a
decree for the defendants wa3 pronounced by
.TihW Alvburtcn. the case was dismissed
and the tobacco restored to the custody of M.
P.ml the French Consul.
This plain and simple statement will show
that the claim of the Federal Government
to this tobacco is utterly untenable, as the
Confederate Government had, nearly two
years before the evacuation of Richmond,
abandoned all claim to the tobocco and sur
rendered the custody of it.

of his congregation in one of the rooms at
namner Hall, a well known institution of
learning.
Of course such an occurrence is much to
be deplored by all persons who sincerely de
sire the restoration ot tne country lo-peace
and quiet under the constitution and laws.
Nothincr could be more irritating to a people
bred to an abhorence of everything looking
like interference with the worship cf God,
than a persistent effort to deny the ministra
tion ot the Uopei to so old anu respcciaoie
a body of Christians as compose the Episco
pal Church of Alabama. A c do not believe
there, is a more loyal congregation in the
United States; but Bishop AVilmer preferred
to receive his orders from the higher author
ities of his own Church, as to tho form of
worshin which he should prescribe for his
people, and as he was especially enjoined to
pray lor the civil auuioruy, which, accuru
ing to his conception of the situation when
lie wrote, did not include President Johnson,
he had the prayer omitted for the time being
for tho President of the United States, and
by so doing, the Episcopal Church of Ala
bama lias since been closed bv order of the
military authorities at Nashville and Mobile.
It was hoped that thcRcctoraof theChurch
might, ere this, have been relieved of all dis
ability by order of the President ; but, in
the absjence of any such orders, it is presum
able that Gen. Davies does not feel at liberty
.to diobcv thc.ordcrs of his superior, previ-
. .i t .1 i i ?
ously promulgated, anu mat no is auuug in
the discharge of a disagreeable duty in pur
suing this course otherwise his conduct in
this matter would be reprehensible in the
extreme.
DR. PAESON3 AND THE LOUISVILLE CON
. TERENCE.
Wo regret to observe that this eminent
divine has got into bad odor with his church.
AVo copy the Jbllowing from the St. Louis
Christian Advocate of the 30th, ult.
"The Committee (of the Louisville Con
ference) to whom wa3 referred tho case of
C. B. Parsons, ask leave to report the fol
lowing :
"1. That about tho 2Sfli of December,
1SG1, Dr. Parsons was guilty of such very
serious improprieties as to call for the visits
and pointed reproofs of his Residing Elder,
under which he professed real sorrow, and
freely acknowledged his imprudence and
great 'blunders.
2. Reports in regard la these gross impro
prieties becoming rife in the community, five
or six travelling preachers sent a note to Dr.
Parsons requesting him lor his own, and also
sk an
written
tiled
already;" alluding to the merciful action of
the Presiding tlder, who had treated the
eic as an imprudence only.
"When Doctor Parsons heard, through a
leading member of the Louisville Confer-
ence, ol the existence and contents ot said
note, and that he would soon receive it, lie
inquired of said member what he thought
would be the ycrdict of a committee if one
should be called, and when told to answer,
I think suspension until Conference,' he.
Parsons, replied, 'that would be my ruin ;'
and then said his mind was rnaue up to
withdraw from the Methodist Episcopal
Church Scith, and, at his own request, the
Presiding Elder, gave him the following
note: 'This is to certify tho Reverend C.
B. Parsons, D. D., LL. D., is a member of
the Ixmisvillc Annual Conference of the
Methodist Episcopal Church South, and has
served the Twelfth street charge clucicntly
to date.
'"THOMAS BOTTOMLEY, P. E.

"The above was written from memory
but I believe is an exact copy of tho origi
nal.
'"TnOMAS BOTTOMLEY.
" ' Russell villi, September 23,1S05.'"
"Aflor his withdrawal, Doctor Parsons al
lowed publications to be made in the citv
papers, to the .effect that he left the M. l5.
Church South because ho sought a more
loyal Church; and when the members of the
Twelfth street Church and congregation, his
pastoral charge, were about to give all the
facts in the case to tho public lie threatened
to tike that Church by military authority,
adding that he was a member of the Loyal
League. He soon afterward joined th M.
E. Church. Your committee feel deeply to
regret tlic conclusion to which these facts
have led us. AVc recommend the following :
" 1. llcsohtd, That C. B. Parsons, in de
clining a further and more careful investiga
tion of the reports of grave improprieties in
his case .when requested to dosobv his min
isterial brethren, has forfeited tho confidence
of tho Conference and the Uiurcli.

Tho Paris Tiqaro givea the following in
teresting particulars about Victor Hugo's
mode of composition : It seems that, up to
this time, he has never allowed a single line
of his writing to go tho printer's. He has
all his "slips" copied out by his wife or
daugiitcr, and forms a kind of" autographic
museum ol the original manuscripts ot all
his works. From that rule, however, ho has
departed, as regards tho new poems, which
were chiefly in pencil on an album ; the slips
were torn out ot the book and taken ilircctlv
to tho printer's, at Brussels, 'sliero they are
being set under the author's own eye "It is
a curious fact that Victor Hti';o should labor
under the delusion that lie hi is mistaken his
vocation, and that, as a painter, he would
have achieved greater fame.

In the new order of things prescribed by
the convention .the Justices of the Supreme

"by and with the advice and consent of the
Senate." The General Assembly is also em
powered to associate the Judges of the Cir

All civil officers of thetate and counties tire
called on to rcsnmc their offices. The Provis

committee of three to report to the General
Assembly necessary changes and amendments
to existing statutes.
He is also requested to exert himself to
proenre the removal from the interior of the
State of the United Stales trooi?, and he is
authorized to organize the militia for tho
preservation of order. A resolution was
parsed by the convention requesting Presi
dent Johnson to pardon or parole Mr. Jef

onvention was the appointment qf a dclcga

to the President the earnest desire of the

Business in New York. Tho Journal
of Commerce says:
If any one desires to see a busy city he can
find it here. The retail stores are crowded
with customers, and the most expensive ar
ticles find ready and rapid sales. There
seems to bo a mania for spending money, and
nothing is too extravagant for the tastes anil
purses of the citizens of New York. These
remarks apply not only to the luxuries of
life, but to tho necessaries as well. The in
crease of prices does not operate to check
sales, either in articles of food, clothing or
ornaments. The manufacturers of furniture
arc pressed to their utmost ability to meet
their orders.
The importers of rare and costly works
of art are not able to supply 'the demand.
The carpet stores have been reduced to the
lowest stocks, and could not open goods with
enough rapidity to supjily their customers. It
is ccrtaiu that New ork never knew such
prices as have been paid this fall, and we
only echo what we hear from all the retail
dealers in saying that there was never such a
busy season. There is something to think of
in this state of affairs. It is not always an
evidence of prosperity when snch extrava
gance is visible. AVo state the facts aud

This distinguished officer, who will ever be
associated in the public mind with the cher
ished names of Robert E. Lee and Stonewall
Jackson, is now in our city, and a guest at the .
St. Charles Hotel. He is still suffering
slightly from a severe wound received at the
battle of the "Wilderness. "Wo are gratified
to learn that there is a prospect that this gal

receive from our citizens will confirm him in

A Veto in Mississippi. Gov. Hum
phreys has vetoed the bill proposed by the
Legislature of Mississippi, staying suits and
the execution ol judgments in that state, and
it has failed to be passed over his veto. Tho
reason is that the delays provided for were
so long, that it operated as a denial of jus-

The veto stood in the House 45 to 27.
Diaplianotvpes arc painted bv the minia
ture painter on porcelain, which has first
been impressed with the exact features of tho
sitter through the photographic process.
This requires first that the photographer
should be skillful and a true artist, and next
that the miniature painter should have all
the gifts which would make his pictures on
ivory bcautilul and desirable.
The translucent surface of porcelain thus
conveys to tho eye a more elegant picture
than could have been procured on ivory, and
by lar a more exact portrait than the artist s
pencil could alone produce.
The Dismemberment of Virginia.
Several of the Virginia newspapers are" dis
cussing with much earnestness the feasi
bility of restoring that State to the statu juo
ante btllum. They argue that the "Wheeling
Alexandria .Legislature was a war necessity;
but the rebellion being suppressed, they ask
if Congress will not review its action in dis
membering a etatc, and remit the question
back to the people. They especially protest
against tlic claim of "West Virginia to the
counties of ilcrkelevand Jelicrson. Anoth
er slice oft' is more than they arc willing to
spare.
