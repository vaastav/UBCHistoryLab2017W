The President's Mlessage.
''Th message of President Taft to
Congriss is of the usual style of
verbosity. ) ilung to its length ionly
a few of the people will Ireai it iin its
entirety. In this message he has no
reference to the tariff, which he. is
probably reservinlg for a special uil
lerance. Perhaps lie would o iri'-
shadowv the l ariff issue with itheo
trusts, especially the Sherman anti
trust law. Evidently t lie Sherman
nalt has reached the limitations of
its usefulness, if it ever did possess
a single' ingredient calculated to
benefit the people. The trusts have
grown and are growing in deliance
of the. restrictions of this act, which
should he repealed. In his conten
tion over the trusts, lthe good and
the had, the President infers that
"the mere size does not coinstlitulte
a sin," but in the application of the
law there is some difference as to
the sinner. The individual of limi
ited means doing a small business
for a livelhood who would defy the
law could not expect. the same con
sideration that would be given to a
million-dollar concern. Figuratively
the whale would be styled as "clev
er," while the small fry would he
hastened to the pen. In brief, lhe
people can expect, no relief from the
exactions of the trusts and the com
bines, created and upheld by the Re
publican policies, through which the
favored few are fattening while the
toilers are struggling for existence.
Twenty years ago the trusts and
combines were few in number, but
today they are all powerful in their
influence over the national govern
ment.
A change in the administration
from Republicna to Democr'atic con
trol offers the only relief.
Parkerson Has Withdrawn His Sup
/port from Miehel.
From New Orleans is the an
nouncement. that W. S. Parkerson
has withdrawn his support of John
T. Michel for governor. In explana
tion Mr. Parkerson states that the
recent revelations connectind Mi
chel with the White Lake, the Chef
Menteur and the Frelsen matters
does not square with his idea of the
proprielies of right or of correct
public service.

starts out to shop in London she has
a definite idea in hl'r mind of some
thing she intends to hbuy. She goes
into a shlop in precisely the same
way she visits lier green grocer. Ont
entering she knows she goes for a
pair of gloves, ijust as on confrott
ing thle grocer she is coniviinced Ihal
she requires a heald of lettce or
lire fresh ltomltatoes.
The American woman is not near
ly so definite wheni! s.h would a
shopping go. It oft e. happens thal
her fin iancial positio n makes it
neessar'v fort her to nIlaullfactllre
iher owni gowns anid hats, to say
nothing of lingerie, so slit very
often goes shopping t sose whal are'
the Ilatest siyles.
W\ilh us shopping is an anll-day af
