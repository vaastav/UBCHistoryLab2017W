THE PHE?DF^(T'S MESSAGE.
[ f*ft mud from First Pag*]
tv^n sugge-td shall deter me from giving the
measure my earnest support.
And! urgently rerommend, should there be a
full are t> p is.-. nuv other act. up n this subject,
that an approprl tlon of 125,000 p r year maybe
made for the enforcement of section 1753 of the
Revised st itut?s.
With the aid thus afforded me, l shall strive to
execute the pr. visions uf that law according to its
letter and sr lr:L
I am unw filing, in Justice to the present civil
rv,*nts of t.V* government. to dismiss ttils subject
without dec' irtng my dir-s'-nt from the severe
and almost indiscriminate censure with wlilch
tli' y h.ve been re enfly assailed. That they ; re
as a class indolent. Inefficient, and corrupt, is a
Ft term lit uhtch has been o'U>n m ide and wideit
cr-d't'M. But when the extent, variety, delicacy,
and imp >rt mcc of their dutl - are corsidered, the
great m ijorlty or ilv^ <mj?l. v s of The gov< rnrnent
ere In my judgment deserving of high commendation.
The continuing decline o* the m^rchtnt marine
of the United st .t s Is greatly to be deplored, fn
Tl w of the fact that we furni-h so lirge a proportion
ef the fr ights of the commercial world,
and that our shlpm nts are steadily and rapidly
Increasing, it Is cause o. surprise that not only Is
our navig t en Interest dlm;n'.->hi'ig, but It Is less
th *n wli 'n our exports ami Imports wen- not half
so large r.s now, either in bul'. or value. There
nm-t Ik' some p vull ir hinder inc? to the development
of th;- 1-it'Ti-~t, or th?' ent rpris?* and energy
of Ann rtcan mechanics arid capit lists would have i
kept thla country at lest nbreast of
our riv?ls in the friendly conte>t for
ocean supr inacy. The substitution of iron j
for wood an l of sream for sail h ve wrought great
revolut ot'S In tli- c irrylm: trade of the worl i; but
th se chant s could not have h"en adverse to
America If we had given to < ur navigation lntcrrsls
a portion of the aid and protection which have
teen so widely lies:owed upon our manufactures.
I commend the whole subje< t to the wisdom of
Congress, with the suggestion th.t no question of
great t magnitude or f .rther-reacblng Importance
can engage th? Ir attention.
In 1S75 the supreme Court of the United States
eel-red un- on-tllut onal the st t t *s of cert iln
fctat <s which imposed upon ship-owners or consignees
a tax of one dollar and a half for each
Jk-'ssensrer arriving from u foreign country, or, in
feu thereof, required a bond to indemnity the
Stat ? and local authorities against expense for j
the future relief or support of such passenger.
Since this decision the expense attending
the care find supervision of Immi- !
gr nts has fallen on the States at whose :
ports thev h .ve landed. As a large majority of !
such immlzTants, immedi tely upon their arrival,
proceed to the Inland States and the Territories to
s ^k permanent homes. It is manifestly unjust to
fcnpose upon t-lie state whose shores they first
reach, the burden whi ii It nowhe.rs.. For this
re son, and because of the nation .1 importance of
the subject, I recommend legislation regarding
the supervision and transitory care of Immigrants
at the p? rts of deb art: lion.
I regret to st ite th f the people of Alaska have
reason to complain th t they are as yet unprovided
with any fort i or government by which life
or property can Im- protected. While the extent of
ft* population do. s not Justify the application of
the costly ma lrn? ry of Terr t-Maladministration,
there Is immediate necessity for constituting such
a form o' government as will promote the education
of the people and secure the administration
of Justice.
The senate, at Up last se-slon, pnese 1 a bill providing
for the construction of a building for the
l Rmj of Goagres 1 ut it failed to btcome a law.
The providon of -uitable protection for this great
coDe< tlon of hook-, and for the copyright depart- (
nu nt t onnecte-1 with it, has become a subject of j
oitional importance and should receive prompt'
att^-ntlon
The report of the Commissioners of the District t
of Columl la, herewith transmitted, will inform
you fully of theiondition of the affairs o? the District.
They urg" the vital Importance of legislation for
the reclamation and Improvement of the marshes
and for the estahlishmentof the harbor lines along
the Potomac liver front.
It Is r? presented that in th<dr present condition
thes" marshes seriously affect the health of the
residents of the adjacent parts of the city; and
that they greatly mar the general aspect of the
park In whi h stands the Washington Monument,
This Improvement would add to that park and to
the park s uth of the Executive Mansion a large
area of valuable land, and would transform wh it
Is now b Ib ved to be a dangerous nuisance Into
an attractive landscape extending to the river
front.
They recommend the removal of th'* steam railway
lines from the surface of the stre t.s of the
citv, and the location of the necessary depots in
FU' h places as may be convenient for the public
accommodation: and th'y call attention to the defi
lem y of the water supply, which seriously affect~
the material prosperity of the city and the
h- alth and comfort of its Inhabitants.
I coniffiend these suhje<jts to your favorable con deration.
The import mee of t'urely leglslat'on with reqp
i-t to the ascert iinment and dechirat'on of the
vote for Presidential electors was sharply called
to tne attention of the people more than tour years
a'-ro.
It is to he honed that some well-defined measure
may he devised before another national ela tion,
which will render unnecessary a resort to any expedient
of a temporary character, for the
determination of questions upon contested
returns
questions which concern the very existence of
the government and the liberties of the people
were suggested hv the prolonged illness of the
late President, and his consequent incapacity to
perform the functions of his office.
it is provided by the second article of the Constitution,
in the fifth clause of its first section,
th it "in case of the removal of the President from
office, or of Ids death, resign .tlon, or inability to
discharge the powers and duties of said office, the
same shall devolve on the Vice-President."
What 1- the Intendment of the Constitution In its
specin ation of "in tbility to discharge the powers
and duties of said office,"' as one of the contingencies
whi h calls the Vice-President to the exercise
of Presidential functions?
Is the inability limits! In Its nature to long-continued
Intellectual incapacity, or has it a broader
Import?
What must be its extent and duration?
H<>w mu-t its existence be established?
Has the Pre-i lent, whose inability Is the subject
of inquiry, any voice in determining whether or
n->t it ext-ts, or Is the decision of that momentous
and delicate qu?tlon confided to the Vice-President,
er Ls it contemplated by the Constitution
that Congress should provide by law precisely
what should constitute Inability, and how and bv I
what tribunal or authority it should be ascertained.
If the Inability prove* to he temporary In It* narVire,
and during 1(3 continuance the vice-President
lawfully exercises the functions of the Executive,
by what tenure doe* he hold his office?
Ik* s he continue as President for the remainder
of the four years' rerra?
Or would the elected President, If his Inability
should cease In the interval, b" empowered to resume
nis office?
And if having sueh lawful authority he should
exercise it, would the vice-President be thereupon
empowered to resume his powers and duties as
Bucnr
I cannot doubt that these Important questions
will receive your early and thoughtful consideration.
Ifc-eply lmpress?*d with the gravity of the responsibilities
which have so unexpectedly devolved
upon me, it will b my constant purjxise to co-operute
with you in such measures as will promote
the glory of the country and the prosperity of its
people.

of $7,000,000, have been Bled ln the Court of
Claims against the District of ColumWaT
and you wouldn't have cot Into It If you hadnt

Mr. Scovllle added that he wanted to show that
the prisoner n*>ver li id any grounds that a sine
man would act upon, for expecting the President
and others mentioned would do what he asked. "]
dont expect to question the President about the
political situation or Lis political relations."
The prisoner Interjected another tirade against
Mr. 8coville here, closing by sayinsr, "You never
had anything to donrlwi these high-toned men
and you don't know tKwp-ro treat them."
Mr. Porter in a few ldipresslve words suypested
that the prosecution^ was willing to admit the
President's written and sworn answers as testimony.
He spoke of the wnusual proceeding of the
Judiciary summoning the Executive to leave his
important duties at the call of a criminal.
The prisoner broke out ag\?ln in a denunciation
of Mr. Scoviiie, saying he wanted Mr. Storrs in the
defence. MI want a flrst-elass artist in this business,"
he said.
the president not to appear in court.
Mr. Scoviiie unuounced that he was willing to
propound written questions to the President and
accept the President's-written answers, under the
agreement that they should be accepted as evidence.
He then read to the41117 some handbills already
mentioned in Thr Star as introduced in evidence.
?7ohn W. Guitoau was recalled to the stand,
simply for the purpose of explaining his testimony
in regard to certain dates.
THE DEFESCE CLOSED.
When he left the stand Mr. Scoviiie, at 11:15 a.
m., said: "I believe, if the court pleases, that that
closes the defence."
The prisoner was riled again, and demanded
that the witnesses he wanted should be summoned.
" I can't see the necessity for producing those
witnesses," said the court, "and I can't make the
order."
gciteau notes an exception to phe ruling of
tub court.
The prisoner said he would note an exception.
The prosecution having said that Mr. Scoviiie
would have to read every part of Gulteau's book
that he expected to call the attention of the Jury
to, the prisoner resumed the reading. There was
considerable noise in the court room caused by
persons leaving.
"If anybody desires to go out," said the prisoner,
"they will please do so now. Some of this book Is
quite Interesting. It woud do people g ood to hear
The reading was Interrupted for a minute, by
Mr. Scoviiie, who asked that E. C. Spltska, of New
York, be called. Mr. Spitska not answering,
Mr. Scoviiie asked for an attachment.
The prisoner then resumed his reading, occasionally
stopping to comment upon the doctrines
enunciated. He always addressed his hearers as
a lecturer would, as "ladies and gentlemen."
When Guireau had bsen reading nearly an hour,
Mr. Corkhlll arose and said he thought the court
should stop such a wearisome proceeding by directing
Mr. Scoviiie to look over the book, and
mark such passages as he wished to use before the
jury.
Mr. Davldge remarked that he could not see
what relevancy the portions of the book read had
to the issue, and seconded ilr. Corkhill's proposition.
After some discussion, an arrangement was
made by which Mr. Scoviiie agreed to look over
the book and hand to the prosecution a memorandum
of the passages to which he might desire to
refer.
Mr. Scoviiie asked whether the "Berean" was
considered in evidence, as it had been quoted by
the prosecution.
"on the same principle," said the prisoner, "you
might put the whole Bible in evidence. I quoted
from that too."
After some discussion, Mr. Scoviiie was referred
to the record of the testimony. Mr. Scoviiie, reserving
the right to examine Dr. Spltzka when he
came, announced that his case was closed.
Upon the suggestion of Mr. Corkhill, then, at 12
o'clock, the court adjourned till to-morrow at 10
o'clock, when the prosecution will open its testimony
in rebuttal.

THE TBIAL Of BDITEiU.
TESTIMONY FOR DEFENCE CLOSED.
THE PBI30HEB ABUSES MB. SCOVILLE.
There was a marked decrease In the number
of people about the court house this doming.
Such a decrease does not necessarily imply a
small attendance at the trial, as heretofore hardly
one-fourth of those who came to the court house
have gained admittance. The court room was,
therefore, filled to overflowing when the court was
rapped to order. Mr. Charles H. Reed, one of the
fli^st persons present, said, in reply to a question
from a Star reporter, that he had reconsidered
his determination to take an active part in the dev
fence. He s:ild that he w,:s influenced to this.owing
to the fact that having been a witness in the case
he would now be severely criticised In his profession
if he should enter the case as counsel.
Messrs. Scoville and Reed called at the President's
house last evening, but the President was so
busily engaged that they failed to get an audience.
Mr. Scoville called at the "Gray House"
again early this morning before the President
had risen. He left a note there and
when he came to court st .ted to a Star reporter
that he expected the President would come, but
had no definite information. Mr. Reed occupied
his usual seat during the dcy at Mr. Scoviiie's side.
Senator Kellogg w >s present this morning, and,
at the Invitation of Mr. Reed, s it near the defence
table. Judge Wylie sat with Judge Cox during
the morning. The court convened at 10 :lO,and before
proceeding Judge Cox called Mr. Scoville up
to the bench, where he held a whispered con vernation
with him while the prisoner was being
brought Into the room. Gutteau had a larger
bundle of papers than usual.
gciteac opened the procseding8
by saying: "If the court please, I have prepared
an order for the witnesses,suggested last evening;
I will hand It to your honor." He then handed up
a paper to the court. The order was in regular
form, and called for U. S.Grant,RoscoeConkling,
Collector Robertson, Marshall Jewell, S. W. Horsey,
Whlteiaw Reid, James Gordon Bennett, Wm.
Henry Hurlburt, Chas. A. Dana, George Jones,
Wm. Penn Nixon, Hugh Hastings, and live additional
witnesses not named.
Mr. Scoville called upon Mr. George C. Gorham
as a witness, but Mr. Gorham did not answer.
representative farweu, as a witness.
non. Charles B. Farwell, M. C., of Chicago, was
called and affirmed. He had been, the witness
said, in political life for twenty years, more or
lnss. Being asked If he knew of the difficulties In
the republican party last spring, the witness said
he had read the newspapers. The witness was
then asked for bis opinion as to whether the condition
of the narty threatened Its existence. This
called nut a discussion, the prosecution objecting
to asking the witness for his opinion.
gciteau tells mr. scoville how to do it.
The prisoner also objected, saying: "Rather an
abrupt way of putting it, Mr. Seoville. You ought
to lead up to It smoothly. That is the way you
went for Senator Davis."
;-iff Porter rising, made quite a flowery speech,
facing tiiat the republican party was not In danger
of disruption, nut it was by no means admitted
that there were not men so vile and mean as
to conspire together * j injure the party, ?c.
guiteau excited on politics.
While Mr. Porter was speaking the prisoner became
quit*5 excited, and several times rapping his
list on the table exclaimed, "That's false."
"I say," he said when Mr. Porter sat down,
"the republican party was heating up. It was
red hot the 1st of June and redder hot on the 1st
of July."
Mr. Scoville said he would accept Mr. Porter's
admission that there was no danger of the disruption
of the republlean party, -ind waste no more
time on that branch of the subject.
The witness then testified that he had known
the prisoner at the bar slightly, having met him
the first time In his (the witness') office in'Chicago,
five or six years ago; the prisoner showed 1dm
some new spaper editorials; said he wanted him to
lend him $200,000 to start a newspaper with; and
said he would mike him (the witness) President
of the United States. The witness met the
prisoner again in March last at the Arlington
hotel, when the prisoner wanted hi in to endorse
his application for the Austrian minister.
Mr. Scoville asked what opinion the witness had
rormed from these interviews of the prisoner's
mental condition.
"Well, I never thought him a sane man," replied
the witness.
Mr. Davidge having asked the witness if he had
sccaslon to judge whether the prisoner was capable
of distinguishing between ritrht and wrong,
Mr. Scoville objected. The objection was overruled
and an exception noted.
The witness said he had such an occasion. The
witness said In the matters in which he had talked
with htm he thought he knew the difference between
right and wrong.
inspiration again.
The prisoner having declared again that his defence
was that his act was committed under an
Inspiration of the Deity, the court remarked empatiently:
"What Is the use of saying that so
often ?"
mr. gorham as a witness.
Mr. George C. Gorham, of the Republican, was
then called and sworn. He testified that his resllence
was in California, and that he took an active
Interest In politics. Mr. Scoville then handed to
Mr. Gorham Gulteau's speech, "Garfield against
Hancock." The witness looked at the title, and
was about to hand it back when Mr. Scoville said
lie desired him to read it. Mr. Gorham proceeded
to read it.
Mr. Porter thought it was unnecessary to proceed
30 slowly.
"Very well, sir," said Mr. Scoville; "I will read
some more from the book."
So Mr. (iorham was permitted to sit down while
the reading of the book was resumed.
gciteau a8 a reader.
At Mr. Scoviiie's request the prisoner was allowed
to read. Guiteau seemed delighted to read, and
taking the book read it with a sing-song tone, like
& school-boy's declamation.
When Mr. Gorham had read the speech, the
prisoner stopped reading, and Mr. Scoville asked:
''Have you looked over tlie speech, Mr. Gorham?"
"I have, sir."
"State whether, In your opinion, there Is or not
anything In that speech that would entitle it to
be considered a remarkable production In the campaign?"
There Was an objection to that question, both by
the prosecution and the prisoner.
gciteau again objects to being considered a fool.
"You must abandon your theory that I am a
fool," declared the prisoner, speaking to Mr. Scoville.
Mr. Gorham being directed to answer, said; "I
think there would be a difference of ppinlon as to
that."
" I ask your opinion," said Mr. Scoville.
" It is," suld Mr. Gorham, "a pretty well condensed
statement of the general situation. Neither
remarkable on the one hand or ridiculous on the
other hand."
Mr. Scoville having asked other questions tending
to show up the prisoner's crankiness, the
prisoner made an excited speech, denouncing Mr.
Scoviiie's theory, and ended by saying to that gentleman:
"You're getting cranky on this business
yourself."
gciteau qcestion8 mr. gorham.
When Mr. Gorham was leaving the stand, the
prisoner called him back and said: "IJwantto
know, Mr. Gorham, if you did not write many
editorials last spring denouncing Gen. Garfield."
"The editorials will show for themselves," said
Mr. Gorham.
"Well, isn't that the fact?" Inquired the prisoner.
"I shall not answer unless the court direct* me
as to the contents or the editorials or any snecmc
Mr Gorham heflleso1 me paper will show," said
"I desire your honor's ruling as to whether he
shall answer," said Guiteau.
court6 QIe8 Can be produced lf y?u ?ke," said the
The prisoner asked the court to instruct vir
Gorham to produce the files. instruct Mr.
Mr. Corkhlll said that Mr. Gorham was not the
man In charge of the files. s I,ne
"Mr. Gorhiim," said the prisoner, "is the editor
of the paper, and I understand that he does all the
heavy work on it"
The prisoner went on declaring that the Republican
had been denouncing Gen. Garfield all
along, and was now deifying him.
" Do you admit that fact, Judge," he said, turning
to Mr. Davidge.
"I didn't read it," said Mr. Davidge.
As Mr. Gorham was stepping again from the
stand the prisoner said: "We will have to recall
you at a later time."
Turning to the court the prisoner said: "I desire
to know in this connection if your honor has
signed that order yet. I would like to have the
marshal summon them."
The court said he had not yet read it.
as to the president's testimony.
Mr. Scoville, rising, said that last Friday he
issued a subpoena in this case for President Arthur.
"I have to treat the President," he said,
with all due consideration. I dont know whether
it wll be practicable for him to come on this forenoon
or to-day at any time. If not, I Would like
to know whether the prosecution will admit his
testimony.
Mr. Davidge asked what the defence expected to
prove by the President.
44 I expect to prove by him." said Mr. Scoville,
" that the prisoner here sometime in October addressed
him a letter in familiar terms asking that
certain things of a public character be done, as one
equal would address another. I expect to show by
the President that he never gave him any grounds
for supposing that he knew him."
THE PRISONER EXCITED AGAIN.
The prisoner here in a long speech declared, aa
usual, his easy and familiar relations with Gen.
Grant, President Arthur and others. He turned
angrily to Mr. Scoville, denounced titm because be
was "no criminal lawyer, and no politician," and
said, "You bad no business to get Into this case,
