A McLEAN-PUBLIC
SERVICE ALLIANCE?
Peculiar stories !n connection with
the Bulkeley-McLean contest are In
circulation. One is that State Senator-elect
Donovan (Dem.) of Norwalk,
was "occupied for weeks In Fairfield
and Litchfield counties setting: Bulke
ley Democrats nominated for the Leg
islature, some of whom were later
elected". If this story is untrue. Sen
ator Donovan will undoubtedly attend
to - It promptly and forcibly; if true.
Us influence upon the Democratic side
of the Legislature will be greatly im
paired. , Another story is that Senator-elect
Judson's candidacy for chairman of
the Judiciary commlti.ee was. or will
te. killed, by his stand in favor of tho
re-election of Senator Bulkeley. In
other words, that the McLeanltes con
trol the Senate and will not "allow the
'choice of a Bulkeley supporter to the
Judiciary chairmanship, however su
periorly aualif led he may be for the
position and despite the fact that
there is not the least connection be
tween Itf. duties and the Senatorial
contest. If this is the real reason for
the killlnjr of the Judson candidacy,
the McLean Senators lack . a . proper
"eense of "the eternal fitness of things'
and are damaging their own cause.
But we are inclined to believe that
there Is "a nigger in the woodpile",
and that behind the argument of Jud
son's Bulkeleylsm lurks the real rea
son, viz., Judson's open advocacy of a
properly constructed and empowered
public utilities commission. "
This theory indicates an alliance, or
et. least a community of opinions, be
tween the McLeanltes and the public
eervlce opponents of a public utilities
commission. the: existence of which
was. at least partly. Indicated by , the
activity of recognizable public-service
agents in the Gortd win-McLean inter
est during the campaign. .. ;'
Insurgent Representative Murdoclc
of Kansas now demands the enact
ment of a pure-fabrle bill, under which
all fabrics must be labelled as to their
composition, With such a measure
In effect and enforced, cotton could
no longer masquerade as wool. This
proposition marches In parallel with
the pure-foods, act and is equally
needed as a preventive of fraud upon
consumers. But the Murdock measure
stands no chance whatever of enact
ment so long as Aldrich, who repre
sents the cotton industry, controls the
Senate. ,
The Stamford Advocate suggests, as
la means of depriving the Democrats
of - the next Congress of a valuable
political move that the present Re
publican Congress "take off allA duties
upon Imported dressed meats and live
cattle", which would. It" says, be "Im
mensely popular,
The Impassable obstacle Is" that the
present tariff was made by a combi
nation of protected interests., upon the
"you-tickle-me-and-I-tlckle-you" prln.
c.ple; the whole structure would , top
ple down upon the removal of - any
one of its props.
The N. Y.. N. H. & H. Railroad
Company has voted to construct a tt..
00.000 station at New Haven. We
confess to great curiosity as to whether
or not the railroad will ask the city to
contribute toward the cost of the
structure, whether or not the city will
respond favorably to such request if
made, and whether or not. in the event
of refusal, the road will apply to the
Legislature for compulsory action.
The solving of these doubts will show
whether the railroad' discriminates
against Bridgeport. As may be re
called, this city was literally compelled
to contribute heavily toward the cost
of the station and the elevated four
tracking here.
It is the Farmer's opinion that the
city of New Haven will not contribute
a cent toward the cost of the road's
new $1,000,000 station there, that it will
not be asked to contribute, and that
the road will not ask the Legislature
(or compulsory action.
The -argument upon which Demo
cratic legislators are expected to vote
for Senator Bulkeleya re-election, is
"that Senator Bulkeley is of such an
age that the chances of a Democratic
Governor having the opportunity to
appoint a Democrat to succeed him
are much better than will be the case
If Ex-Governor McLean wins out."
If Bulkeley is so feeble as to Indi
cate the near approach of dissolution,
the fact hasn't become generally
known. So far as appears, he Is even
more vigorous physically than the
average man of his age. and his
chances of ' surviving a Senatorial
term may be deemed good.
We should advise that to the argu
ment above cited, there be attached a
pledge by Bulkeley. properly attested,
that he will. If re-elected with the aid
of Democratic votes, commit sulslde
within a year of the commencement
of his new term. This would substi
tute a certainty for an improbability.
Banker Clews' weakly review of gen
eral conditions and of ihe stock mar.
feet differs from that of the previous
'week In that it is optimistic in a
material degree. President Taft's
message, advising "the cessation of
attacks upon capital", is "favorably
accepted In financial circles". Money
1s easy. Interest rates low. prices of
many good stocks and bonds low
enough to invite investors, and the
outlook in general business conditions
"is for betterment".
The most serious uncertainties. Mr,
Clews says, "are the action of the
Interstate Commerce Commission on
railroad rates, and the pending Su
preme Court decisions upon OH and
Tobacco cases". Of these, he says:
There is little doubt but that some
concessions will be made to the rail
roads, even though they be much less
than desired. Concerning the Supreme
Court decisions. It is also to be as
sumed that the judicial spirit will pre
vail, and that politics and prejudice
will be rigidly eliminated. It must be
taken for granted f.hat no property
wll be destroyed, and that property
rights will be preserved. If the strict
est possible construction of the Sher
man law be enforced many of our
great combinations will be forced to
disorganize, causing more or less tem
porary confusion, but even then the
plants will remain, :and the demand
for their products will not be abated
one whit by any decision within the
power of the Supreme Court. There
Is good reason to believe that some
of our largest corporations have made
plans in advance which will enable
them to comply with the law with
little disturbance.
In conclusion, Mr. Clews deals with
the future of the stock market and
says: v .
The outlook is promising for father
more activity and a fair advance, al
though In view of lessened satisfactory
conditions or business no very pro
nounced urward movement is yet In
sight. Readjustment Is not yet com
plete, and inflation has riot been en
tirely eliminated, but there Is nothing
seriously ur.sound in the situation;
and if commodities can - only be
brought to a more reasonable basis
there is nothing to prevent a restora
tion of business activity.
The bringing of commodities ; to "a
more reasonable basis" depends In no
slight degree upon a ' refusal of the
Interstate' Commerce Commission to
approve the proposed, increase in
freight rates, a point which Mr. Clews
seems to have overlooked.
PROBE WORTH
WHAT IT COST
, 11,11 I (I HI i
County Commissioners Walter
and Geddes Hit Hard by
Council's Report ;
New Haven, Dee. 12 Declaring- a
Conviction that the present county
commissioners "have not conducted
the admlnis oration of their office ac
cording to that standard ' of ' official
conduct which the people of this coun
ty have a risrht to demand", and, that
the term of two county commissioners.
Jacob D, Walter and Col. Geddes. will
soon expire, and that the committee
thinks the council of one hundred
would be Justified in making a strong
protest against their reappointment,
the report of the committee of the
council of one hundred on the county
probe last summer haa been made
public, . -
The report first of all scores the way
in which the investigation committee
was named. And in concluding the
report, says:
"The Investigation was In some re
spec 3 not as thorough and scorching
as we could have wished. But It was
quite worth all that It cost, and would
have been amply Justified even If It
had appeared that the county commis
sioners were conducting the" business
of the coun y on business principles
and in accordance with the law."

Daniel Davenport and Stiles Jud
son held a long argument on Satur
day, before J udge Nobbs, In the xf -flee
of Judge Banks, at the Town
hall, with reierence to the considera
tion of the case of Mrs. Julia Watts
Morris Curtiss, Judge Banks, the
conservator, was present, also Mr.
Kellogg, of New York, counsel for
Mrs. Uurtiss. Mrs. Curtiss did not
appear, and Dr. Lawrence, who wai
wanted as a witness, sent an affida
vit, the purport of which was that
he had appeared betone the court,
been examined at length, and been
excused. He declined to make any
turtuer appearance. Ho denied that
Mrs. Curtiss -was Intoxicated on cer
tain dates mentioned in the affidavit.
Judge Nobbs said the court could not
compel the presence of Dr.. Lawrence.
Mr, Davenport wished a date set
when Dr. Lawrence could be heard.
Judge Nobbs said he was anxious to
conclude the case before his term of
office expires, which will be in about
three weeks. If. he can have All
the evidence, and the depositions be
fore he goes out of office, he can
render his decision afterwards. Mr.
Davenport thought the case should
be adjourned until Mrs. Curtiss ap
pears. Stiles-Judson argued that she
never Intends to come, and that . to
postpone would only prolong the
matter and throw It over into the
jurisdiction of the new judge of pro
bate, when the whole thing would
have to 'be gone over aerain, de novo.
He thought it a waste of time and a
needless exnense. He would see Mrs.
Curtiss rmnished for contempt of
court. It was denied by Mr. Daven
port that any motion had been made
previously to dismiss the case In tho
event of the failure of Mrs. Curtis3
to appear. He eaid the lawyer's fees
thusfar amount to $15,000 and that
money could not be had to pay them
unless . the place at Sasco Hill was
mortgaged. Judge Nobbs remarked
that Mrs. Curtiss had been Judged In
competent, and it was his duty to
see that she received tender care and
consideration. Mr. Davenport said
he wished to produce witnesses to
discredit the testimony of Dr. Law
rence. Judge NobbS said that if ha
was satisfied Mrs. Curtiss had delib
erately refused to obey the summons
of the court, he would be Inclined to
dismiss the case. Mr, Judson was
appointed by the court the "next
friend" .of Mrs. Curtiss. The court
would not assume that the conduct
of Mrs. Curtiss was contemptuous.
The upshot of the whole matter was
that the case was set. down for fur
ther hearing next Monday at II
o'clock. "
Much interest was manifested in
town , on Saturday regarding the ex
amination of Joseph Klisch charged
with shooting, last October, Mandus
Peterson, a farm hand living at Mill
Plain. The court room was thronged
and many prominent citizens were
present. Peterson appeared with his
left hand done up in dressings. He
is evidently , a Swede, and has the
reputation of getting intoxicated fre
quently. Mr. Klisch brought into the
court the double barrelled gun, which
he admitted he used when shootin
at Peterson. ' sThe crowbar which
"flew" through the kitchen window,
the potato digger and the window it
self were in the room as a part of
the "material", evidence. That there
was a row at the Klisch residence,
owing to the fact that Peterson was
very drunk, everyone concerned ad
mitted. After all the evidence had
be?n heard the court bound Kliach
over under bonds to the amount of
f500, to appear before the Superior
court.

, Public opinion, so far as expressed,
regarding a prosecuting liquor agent,
to take the place left vacant by
Clltus King, is (in favor of having
some competent attorney ' appointed
to fill the place, and not to rely up
on any - one who can be picked ap
for the moment. ;- All matters per
