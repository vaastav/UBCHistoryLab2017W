Conference Fails
i To Accept Battle
| As Jury-s Counsel
Hope Is Held Ont, However,
for Amicable Arrangement
S to Retain Him in Probe of
District Attorney's Office
. The status of George Gordon Battle
as special counsel to the extraordinary
grand jury to assist that body in its
investigation of the offices of District
Attorney Swann and the Hylan city
administration was uncertain yester?
day.
A two-hour conference in the Har?
vard Club was attended b.- Mr. Battle,
Raymond F. Almirall, foreman of the
grand jury, and Clinton Tyler Brain
ard, secretary, but no definite date for
Mr. Battle's appearance before the
grand jury w.. - an rtpuneed.
The conference was said to have
brought no definite solution of the situ?
ation which arose following Mr. Bit
tie's designation as Special Assistant
District Attorney by District Attorney
Swann at Governor Smith's request,
when certain grand jurors expressed
opposition to Mr. Battle as jury pilot.
The conference ended at 7 o'clock
last night. Mr. Battle said that it had
been "a very pleasant and frank dis?
cussion," but that there had been no
?hange in the situation. Neither did
Foreman Almirall nor Mr. Brainard
; have any announcements to make.
Although the grand jury still felt
because of his "My Dear, Edwiard'
letter to the District Attorney : I hi
personal friendship for Mr. Swann, Mr
Battle was not the man best fitted t<
aid in an inquiry into corruption ii
public o!V;cc, the talesmen were hopV'u
that some amicabl arrangement Co;
the inquiry under Mr. Battle might bi
reached.
The jury, it was reported, still feel
that as a special assistant district at
torney Mr. Battle would be obligei
to accept the t:.cilities of Mr. Swann'
office, which ia itself under investiga?
tion, and us? his stenographers and
other office assistants, which would not
bo in harmony with the jury's ideas.
The grand jury will adjourn for two
weeks on December 19.

No Convict Plot to Burn
Sing Sing, Says Rattigan
investigation Discloses Cigarette
Caused One and Others Dne
to Spontaneous Combustion
Charles Rattigan. state Superintend?
ent of prisons, conducted an investiga- .
tion at Sing Sing yesterday into the
causea of three (1res there within a
period of less than*two weeks. After |
he had talked with prison employees
and twelve convicts he declared he was i
convinced fhp fires were not of in- j
cendiary oripin. He said he was posi?
tive there was no "convict plot" to |
burn the prison. A cigarette butt ;
caused one of the fires, he said, and j
the others were due to spontaneous!
combustion.
Mr. Rattigan was assisted in his in- ;
vestigatlon by his confidential clerk, i
William A. McCabe, and Daniel J. j
Grant, superintendent of industries at j
Auburn prison. irant and McCabo ?
will remain at Sing Sing until a new !
warden is appointed to succeed Mr.
Brophy.
The first of the three fires, Novem- '.
bcr 20, was in a lavatory. Mr. Rattigan
said it was caused by a lighted cigar- ?
et'e. The second, on November 21,1
started in a prison warehouse. Mr. ?
Rattigan said he believed that spon- i
taneous combustion was responsible
for this tire. A third fire was last j
Monday night. Painters and decora- ;
ors had been at work in the office of
the Mutual Welfare League and had'
left oil-soakod rags on the floor.
"It is a great injustice to the inmates
of the prison," Mr. Rattigan said, "to !
blame these fires on a convict plot, j
There wasn't any convict plot."
Arbitration To Be First
Subject for Labor Parley j
WASHINGTON, Dec. 3.?"Adjustment
and A rbitration" will be the first subject
considered by the second industrial con-1
ference.
After exhaustivo discussion to-day of ;
the recommendations made yesterday by ,
President Wilson in his message to Con- \
gross and a tentative program prepared j
by Herbert C. Hoover, vice-chairman, ?
with the assistance' of other delegates, I
the conference decided that means for |
peaceable settlement of industrial dis- ]
rutes should head the list of work to be i
done. The subject will have numerous j
divisions, including establishment of per
manent tribunals to maintain industrial !
peace, all of which will be studied from
every angle before the final report is
ready.
It became evident from the work
started to-day that the conference will
require several weeks, at least, to com?
plete the enormous task mapped out.
The part of the program already
tdopted was said to contain the most
pressing subjects of the present situa
non, including collective bargaining,
hours of labor and wages. President
Wilson's message to Congress was an?
alyzed by the delegates for subjects to
b^ discussed and each was given a place
tlong with the subjects proposed by Mr.
Hoover. The delegates then debated
how far they should go in studying each
subject and selecting those on which ex?
pert advice and written data were de?
sired.
