Occualon--A NII'?IIKUIHI Timely l*u|t?i'.
Governor John lVtcr Uiohivrdson was
duly inaugurated Oil Tuesday thc 80Ul
ult.i iu tho Opera House at Columbia.
After hiking tho oath of ollicc. Governor
Uiclmrdson made his inaugural address,
as follows:
Gentlemen ot tho Senate and House
ot Representatives: lt is with a deep
sense of tho responsibility and obliga
tion L assume] that 1 have just taken in
this solemn presence the constitutional
r?ath of ollico as Governor of South Car
olina.
With no ordinary emotion, uud with u
heart lull of gratitude to thc people ol
this State, through whose partial kind
ness 1 am tho recipient of this exalted
honor, J this day inter upon thc- dis
charge of its lug!? duties, to thu faithful,
honest, vigilant and patriotic execution
oi which l pledge the honor of a devoted
son ol' Carolina.
Sincerely distrustful id' my own abili
ties, 1 confidently rely upon you, theil
chosen representatives, tor such wisc,
liberal and conservative action as will
render tho progress of the State in
material prosperity rapid and the execu
tive administration of ber affairs easy.
To the most unobservant and indiffer
ent it must be apparent timi these arc
times fruitful of vast and pressing
problems, social, industrial and econom
ic, both in State and national affairs,
which demand for their solution the al ?lest
talent and most unselfish patriotism.
Notwithstanding thc dual nature of our
institutions and government, investing
the citizen, as it does, with varied duties
and interests, the peculiar condition ol
our State, socially and politically, dining
thc dark days of reconstruction, rigidly
confuted thc attention of our people to
the seemingly hopeless ami Herculean
task of wresting from a chaos of cor
ruption and venality in all their hideous
forms, and id universal malfeasance m
official life, such as had never before dis
graced the annuls of a sivilized commu
nity, order and good government.
How successfully, how marvelously,
this has been accomplished, m ed 1 at
tempt to describe? Surely, it can never
bo possible that the deep, soul-burning
humiliations, the crushing tyranny, thc
ruinous taxation we so long endured, tin
bold ciVrontery of loathsome vice in high
places that stalked in open daylight
through the streets ol' this beautiful
capital, have so soon passed out of mimi
and been forgotten like the idle tu ror:
of u dream, amidst tho quieting, restful
surroundings of the renewed peace, onie!
and good government we now MI bounti
fully enjoy. T'> the people of Carolina.
1 verily believe, one of the greatest mis
fortunes that could occur would be an
oblivious disregard of a lormor experi
ence that, upon thc least cessation of
vigilance on their part, might, and would
almost surely, again become a terrible
possibility. The same elements ol evil
are Lore, tin' saim forces present, though
latent; bul to this general ion, who are
tho witnesses of and the sufferers from
certainly the most anomalous and . \
traordiuary condition of political and
social life under which a people ever
lived, I du not think lhere can over come
any deluge of I,ethelin waters so over
whelming as ti i sink into oblivion tlie bit
ter memories ol' tiie past. Sad, iudced,
would be the SUIT rcsultsof ?liminai for
getfulness of a lesson .so roughly taught,
so heroically learned! No, this cai
never lie. Wc are again in the house ol
our fathers, as masters ain't rulers, ami
we are here to stay OS ; uch for all time
but to stay inspired by the tine instinct:
ol' liberty and animated solely by a high
and patriotic purpose to dispense even
handed justice, to maintain tin- purity
of our institutions, multo secure to all
classes and conditions of our cittzem
every legal, constitutional and inherent
right ol mau.
With tin.- inestimable advantages o'
good and honest government once mon
surrounding us, like a life-giving atmos
phi iv, how bright tin- prospect f? ?rn mph
advance in all the arts of peace and ii
the accumulation ->l Hie wealth to whicl
our wonderful resources ot .-ml am
ohma te SO justly entitle us! True, wi
are just at this time in a coudition ol
grout business depression, common te
every interest of the whole world, and in
no way peculiar to ourselves, save, pei
imps, in complications arising from tin
transition phase through whicl) om
agricultural industry is now passing. Tc
this great interest WC should certainly
give promptly thai attention which ?ti
importance to the general welfare so Im
peratively demands. Wc should ap
proach its consideration willi that calm
ness uf judgment and freedom fruin pas
sion so essential to reaching w isc conclu
sions. Tiie Department ot Agriculture,
lo whose charge its interests have lu ci,
intrusted, and whose development I HIS
been the object ol' such earliest, faithful
and successful efforts, should be sus
tained and fosb n 1. All laws upon oin
statute books tending to the retardation
of its development, or calculated to
direct its energies into unprofitable
channels, should be at mice ropealcd,
and such measures only as are absolutely
needed for its proper encouragement
should be enacted,
Perfect freedom of action ami judg
ment is tho most Otlioioid incentive to
successful exertion i.i nil the occupations
<d life. This il is the duly of any govern
ment to insure ti? any Citizen, whether
walking in the paths of commerce, fol
lowing the professions, or gathering the
wealth of nature from our teeming for
ests and causing our fruitful fields to
yield their abundant increase. J speak
as a farmer, who loves hi? calling with
an ardor in.'n riled from ancestors devoted
solely to the tillage of the soil, and
whose instincts, aflinitics lind sympathies
arc, therefore, naturally and warmly en
listed in tin; successful furtherance of
that first, grandest and noblest of pur
suits. A fair field, unlrammolcd oppor
tunities, exact justice, freedom from
discriminating legislation, arni such en
couragement as is entirely within the
legitimate Sphere of government, is all
tho American citizen asks or needs, and
constitute the very fundamental princi
ples of the liberty for which Washington
fought and conquered, ami in defense of
which our heroes crimsoned the count
less hills and valleys of the Sunny South.
May the genius of liberty preside for
ever over our destiny and direct all our
offerts to the accomplishment of so glori
ous a triumph in government".' science.
Amidst Hie abundant causes for con?
gi at ulai ion, we certainly possess ono in
tiie restored credit and improved finances
of tiie State, brought to renewed bte. os
it were, from a condition of almost abso
lute decay and death. We should aol
forget to scan closely the oxpenditin es of
thc government, ?ml restrict them within
tho limits of a wise and liberal economy.
This is but simple justice to tho taxpay
er, who, howevor cheerfully and uncom
Jribute, should not bo subjected to groat
ur burdous ?linn th? necessities of gov
ernment imperatively denium!.. But it
should also bo remembered that the
smallest and fewest appropriations aro not
always tho wisest economy. Govern
ment is business, und, like any other
business, requires for its successful eon
duct tlio uso ol money; such, tor in
stance, us for tho adequate compensation
ol oitioi&ls, the proper maintenance ol
charitable and penal institutions, thc
prompt payment of nil public obliga
tions, thc liberal support ol common
schools ami higher institutions of learn
ing, tho necessary expenses of legislation
itself, and tit*' numerous other incidental
purposes that loot up no incouHiderabh
amount.
Wc have already achieved much in iii?
way of economy, having reduced ex
pcuditures to a point that places tho gov
ernment ol this State among thc cheap
est, ii not tho very cheapest, of tlit
States of tho Union. A comparison ol
our expenditures with those ol any olhoi
State will, I aili sure, fully justify thii
assortion. While looking, then, wi tl
continued care to tho exercise of tim
cardinal virtue of economy in t ho admin
ist ration ot our ulhiirs, especial attention
sh-mid bc paid to maintaining the credit
