The following special despatch to the
Hmald has been received from our corres
pondent in the capital of Wallachia, by way of
London:?
Bucharest, Dec. 5, )
Via London, Dec. 6, 1871.)
The Roumanian government has received
from Constantinople a formal protest, made on
the part of the Porte against the final conclu
sion of tbe treaty which was negotiated some
two years since with Russia relative to the
regulation of conaular jurisdiction in the terri
tory of the Danubian Principalities.
The Suitan'e government justifies its action
on tho ground that this treaty arrangement
between Wallaohia and the Czar constitutes a
violation of tbe clause of the Treaty of Paris of
1858, which stipulates .that Russia shall not
seek executive power or aggrandizement on
the Danube, aud that tbe Ilospodar is really
tributary to the chief authority in Constan
tinople.
PKUMIAN POLIOT.
Tbe promulgation of the Turkish protest at
the present moment is ascribed to the influence
of Prince Bismarck, who, although entirely
Indiflbronl to the claims or authority of Prince
Charles, has induced the Sultan's government
to assert its sovereignty in Wallachia as part
and parcel of his preseut garue of statecraft
towards Russia.

T?? General Assembly met to-day, a quorum of
Doth houses being present. At one P. M. a Joint
committee waited upon His Excellency Governor
Walker and informed blm of the organization of the
General Assembly and their roadlness to receive
any communication he bad to make.
The Governor then sent In his annual Message,
which Is a lengthy but able and exhaustive docu
ment. He congratulates the people upon the bless
tngs they have enjoyed and the Ills they have es.
caped and the success of tno experiment of univer
sal suffrage ana equality bcrorc the law, which Vir
ginia, the first ol the Southern States, voluntarily
Inaugurated. "Certainly," lie says, "nowhere else
could that experiment have been so successfully
tested, and nowhere else has It been so favorably
and Impartially tried, the result having showed that
under lavorablo circumstances It may bo rendered
not only not antagoulstlc, but rather conducive to
good and stable republican government. Certain it
la that sluco the restoration of civil government in
our Stato we have enjoyed a degree of peace and
good order, of obedience to law and respect for au
thority equalled by rcw and excelled by none of our
sister States. While It is true that this is due In a
very large measure to the law-abiding character
and
man mokai. sentiment of our people,
It cannot bo denied that, to a certain extent, It Is
due to the fact that every citizen of the State, no
matter what tils race or his present or previous con
dition is or mav have been, has beeu fully protected
in tue rights or Immunities of citizenship.
IMMIGRATION.
On the subject of immigration the Governor re
commends: first, the organization of a bureau,
under tho control of a board of alrcctors?
ono from each Congressional district and one from
the Slate at large?to have entire management of
tlio affairs of the bureau; second, the establish
ment In Europe of ono or more agencies for tho pur
pose of furthering Immigration by the dissemina
tion of correct lnlormatlon of the advantages and
Inducements offered to tho emigrant; third, the
establishment at Norroik of a depot to receive the
emigrants when they laud; fourth, the publication
of a pamphlet for distribution at the North aud in
Europe, giving information necessary as to tho
commercial, agricultural, manufacturing, climate
advantages and mineral resources of the State; and
fifth, to invest anthorlty In a commissioner to net
as attorney or agent of owners of lauds in tho State.
| lie concludes by recommending an appropriation
I of $20,000 lor the turthcrance of (bis scheme of im
migration.
TUB EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM?A NEGRO COLLEGE
WANTED.
The Governor states that the success of the school
system inaugurated under the laws passed by the
last Legislature lias surprised its warmest advo
cates, and conclusively demonstrates that the oeo
plo appreciate the benefits as well as the necessity,
both In a material and moral point of view, ol edu
cation. The schools are now supported by a tax
upon property and a capital tax of $i, scarcely one
half ol the latter being oollected.
He advises the amendment of the constitution so
as to provide for the collection of a capitation tax
of $2 only, to be devoted exclusively to the support
of schools, aud prohibit any and every citizen from
voting at any election who doea not pay
this tax. Tho colored people, being clothed
with the elective franchise equally with
the whites, should be educated in order to
intelligently exercise that right. This cannot be
accomplished by any system of mixed schools; each
race must be provided for separately, and the true
Interests of the colored people demand that they
should be provided with separate schools. For this
purpose the government recommends the establish
ment of a college or university for the education of
negroes, wherelu shall be taught all the higher
branches of useful knowledge: the same to be built
and sustained by the sale of tue laud scrip due to
the State by the United states, or by the conversion
of the scrip Into bonds or securities bearing six per
cent interest.
TUE FINANCES ? TOTAL DEBT.
On the subject of the finances tho Governor, in an
elaborate argument, justifies tho Funding Act
passed by the last Legislature by watch Vir
ginia assumes two-tmrds or trie Ami-War
debt, and Issues certificates ror the remaining
third, payable by West Virginia, should that state
airree to pay tills portion of the debt The debt
fundable under that law was $47,033,860, two-thirds
ol which is $81,31*3,910, which Is the portion as
sumed by this State, aud on which the annual In
terest is $1,835,400. by the sale of all the interests
owned by the State In internal Improvements the
total debt will i>e reduced to $30,i.'<i,ooo, two-thirds
of which Is $26,1 oo.ooo, ou which the auuual interest
win oe $i,4d(i,ooo.
RETRENCHMENT AND REFORM.
The Governor then urgently recommends re
trenchment and economy In both the legislative and
Judicial departments of the government, and Indi
cates the means by which such retrenchment can
be easily attained. If inese measures are earned
out it win bo round rhat jpoo.ooo will oe ample to
meet the current expenses of the state government,
tnclodlng the legislation expenses. Add to this the
annual inferesc-$i,420,coo-and the sum of
it,220,000 will be the total required to be realized i
annually from taxation, asldo from what may be
appropriated lor school purposes. To raise this
amount the Governor recommends the taxation of
ail railroads in ttie same proportion as that upon
private proper:y; an increase of the oyster tax;
upon the manufacture and sale of ardent liquors:
stamp tax and an equalization or tho assessments
or real estate, wuich, with the adoption of the
economical reforms he indicates, lie is confident
can meet the expenses of the government and par
ihc inierest or ihe debt promptly as it falls due.

STATES QDVERNMKNT.
Tne moat Important portion of the Governor's
Message Is that devoted to tne subject of elei Hons
and tno recent threatening attitude uaaumed by the
federal toward the state government, which I give
fn rxunao, aa it iiaa a national tutereat, and aa a
campaign document in tho next presidential con
teat la aeoond to none yet published. one of tne
moat serious objections to our communion is the
number and frequency of elections tvnicli it pre
scribes. We now have annually two regular elec

other on rne first Tuesday after the first Monday
in November. Aalde irom tne loss of time 10
the citizen In at;endauce upmi registration
and the polls and tiie excitement or leeling and dis
turbance of business incident to the heavy expense
upon our people, which tliev are illy able to bear,
there la no necessity for lu Thero ought to be not
more than one election each year lor State purposes.
Congressmen are elected every two yearn and a
President every lour years, and by a law of Con
resa the latter election mant bo held on the Tues
sy after tne drat Monday In November, and 1 am
clcarlv of opinion that It la advisable to hold our
Congressional elections at tne time now prescribed
by law; but 1 um very decidedly In lavor of so
amending the constitution as that all Htate, county,
municipal uiid township elections shall be held
on tho lourili Thursday in Mar. This was the
time lor holding Mate elections prescr bed
by our former constitution, and was found
by experience to be the most convenient
time for our people, aud by Its adoption now we
should save the time, expenses and incidental evils
or two elocuons, except iu each alternate year. I

EXCUSE FOR FKPBKAT. INTERVENTION.
By the fourth section ol the first artlclo of tho
foderal constitution tno legislatures oi the several
Btsies are authorized to prescribe tbe tnucs, places
and manner or holding eloctloiis tuerein for Con
gressional Representatives, but tho right to mate or
alter bucU regulations at auy Pine is reserved to
Congress. For more than three-fourths of a century
the authority thus conferred upon tne State l.ogis
tures had been satisfactorily exercised by them.
Twenty-one Presidential and forty-two Congres
sional eloctlons had been held, some ol thein amid
the excitement aw! contusion of foreign wars, or
the throes of domestic revolution, aud yet no occa
sion hail arisen lu the opinion of our wisest states
men, calling for, or that could justliy the assertion
of the reserved right of Congress to make or alter
tbe regulations prescribed by the states. Not uutll
the year I87u, a period of profound peace and uni
versal prevalence oi law anj order, when the Ind
eral ail minisi ration, two-thirds of botu branches of
Congress and three-fourths of all the .state govern
ments were in tne hands ot one political party, did
the Congress of the United States attempt to inter
fere or regulate the mode or manner ol the olecllon
of Its owu representatives, lu that clause of tne
federal constitution which prescribes that "each
house shall be the judge of the election returns
and qualifications of iib owu members" It had,
therefore, round an ample safeguard for tho pro
tection ot the rights aud luterests of lis own
members and tbeir constituents, Tno Forty-first
Congress, however, undertook directly to control
the election, not only of Its owu representatives,
but also the election ot State oillcers held at the
same time, by un act approved Mav 31, 1870, en
titled "An act to enrorce the right of citizens ol tne
United States to vote in tne several States of tuts
Union awl lor other purposes," aud oy uu anieuu
meut thereof, approved February 28, 1871.
CU1CANRKY OF CONGRESS.
The federal government, under the pretenco of
1 protecting the treedotn of the ballot, strikes down
the freedom of tho citizen, aud under the guise of
regulating tho action of congressmen Is sought the
regulation nnu control ol tho artalrs of the states.
In towns of over 20,00j inhabitants the polls muy

Already have some 01 our most worthy citizens been
dragged fiom their homes ana subjected to great
anuoyauce and expeuso lu deiendiug themselves
agaiust unfounded charges instituted under these
laws. The gratification of partisan or personal
malevolence has usually beeu cue actuating motivo
lor these prosecutions. But extraordinary and un
precedented as this legislation was, and unconsti
tutional, us 1 believe it to be, so far as it lnteriorcs
with stale cleciious, It was out the precursor of
auother statute enacted t.y tho Forty-second Con
gress, which more completely compasses the real
purpose for which thev were enacted. This act was
approved on the -JOth ol April, 1871, and is eutltled
"An act to eulorce the provisions of the lourioenm
amendment to the constitution 01 the United Mutoa
aud for other purposes,"
WHY SUSPEND TUX KAPHAS CORPUS 7
Can there ho found in iheso provisions auy
authority for tho suspcustou of (hat grout writ of
right, the habeas corpus, or for the delegation of tho
authority with which Congress uloao was clotned
by the original constitution t certainly not. And
yet that uulhorlty Is attempted to be vested in tno
President of tne United stale* by tho terms of this
act, under tho specious pretext of enforcing the
provisions of the fourteenth amendment. "Tho
privilege of tbe writ of habeas corpus shall not 10
suspended, unless when, In cases of rebellion or
I invasion, ihc public safely may require It," Is the
language of the federal constitution. By the origin,
uature aud bistort of this great writ and bulwark It
Interposes between the freedom of the cltlzou
and the open or stealtny encroachments of lyranuy
were thoroughly understood and profoundly appre
ciated by the irauiers of the constitution, Hence
the absolute prohibition of Its suspension, except
in the two extreme emergencies or foreign invasion
or when rcoeihon raises itself to such a formidable
state and proportion as to threaten the public safety
equally wltn.iorelgn invasion. But Congress, without
even tho pretence that either of toeso exigencies
had arisen, proceedeu in the act under cousldera
ttou not only to resign to the executive this care- 1
rally guarded power with which it aloue was In
vested by the constitution, hut lo doine him (tho
President) with "discretionary authority to exercise
It at will." Although the constitution authorizes
federal Intervention lu tho local affaire or a State
ouly upon the call of tho Slate, and to the extent of
the overthrow of Stale government and the oblitera
tion of Mate lines, aud the substitution In their
stead of military, district and martial law, to tho
arbitrary keeping of oue man are committed the
lives, liberties aud the property of a whole people.

lathers of the republic. Having before them the
experiences ot past generations and past nationali

tho libertv of the citizen, as well as the efficiency of
government, with a wisdom amounting almost to
prescience, they formed our government for per
petuity, and they omitted no principle necessary to
Its preservation, and they included none which,
properly administered, coul-J work its destruction.
The absorption of the powers and function ol
