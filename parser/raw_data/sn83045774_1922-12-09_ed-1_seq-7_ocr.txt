MATTER UP TO PREMIERS
Germany to Pay Fines and
Make Apologies Demanded
of Bavarian Towns.
By LINCOLN EYRE.
Special Cable to Tub New York II era id.
Copyright, 19!t, by The New York Hbuld.
New York Herald Bureau. )
Berlin. Dec. 8. (
The nature of the German reply to
the Entente's demand for apologies
and punitive indemnities in reprisal for
the Bavarian attacks upon allied control
officers is not yet known officially,
but it is understood the Central Government
will pay the tines. Its importance,
however, is entirely eclipsed
by the news, now apparently detinue,
that Chancellor Cuno is preparing to
make a fresh reparations proposal to
the Reparations Commission in connection
with the allied Premiers' conference
in London. j
The basis of these proposals, it is
I understood, is the flotation c?f a loan in
which German industry is expected to
participate, and in the proceeds of
which France will share immediately.
The last point represents an advance
over the program for the stabilization
of the mark formulated by the Wtrth
Cabinet on November 13, and accepted
by Dr. Cuno.
Since Dr. Cuno assumed office he has
been conducting negotiations witii German
industrial barons to learn to what
extent they w;l!l l^lp frame a reparations
policy acceptable to the Allies.
Vnitcd States Ambassador Alanson B.
Houghton and Senator Medill McCormick
also were consulted. It is understood
that Mr. Houghton was informed
of the nronosltion add was authoried
to lay it before Ambassador Harvey
and Henry P. Fletcher, United States
^Minister to Belgium, at their meeting
In London. Lord d'Abernon, the British
Ambassador here, who Is now in London,
also was notified, with the request
that he submit the plan to his Government.(
Ptinnea Dnrka Finn.
The plan originated, It appears, with
a German industrial group, Hugo StlnJics
himself having played a considerable
role in-Its initiation. The fundamental
idea Is the acquisition of enough
casii to stabilize the mark and avert
the financial collapse of France. To
achieve this Stinnes and his associates,
as well as Dr. Cuno and Senator
McCormJck, are convinced there must
be a comprehensivo readjustment of the
reparations system. The schedule of
payments must be scrapped and the
total German indebtedness fixed at a
figure adnflttedl.v compatible with her
power of payment.
It Is hoped France will accept this
course, in exchange for the Immediate
receipt of considerable money to be obtained
by a loan backed not only by
600,000,000 marks gold of the Reichsbank's
reserve, as set forth in the note
of November 13, but also partly by Ger- :
man Industry. German experts are
Confident that as much as 30,000.000.000

marks cold could be raised in this
fashion, a sum sufficient to prevent
further depreciation of the mark and
to insure French solvency.
The Stinnes thesis calls for the establishment
of direct contracts between
Germany Industry and the French consumer
In the devastated regions along
the lines laid down by the StinnesLubersac
agreement. Germany Is likely
to Insist, however, upon complete abandonment
of the French threat of military
sanctions, and possibly curtailment
of Rhlneland occupation, or even lis
abandonment.
Demand Four Years' Moratorium.*^
The fixation of a four years' moratorium
for subser|t^nt reparations payments,
of course, will J>e a basic condition
of the scheme, as it was in the
original proposals fnr the stabilization
of the mark. The new plan has been
discussed not only by the Central Govcrnment,
but by the Federal Prime
Ministers, who are understood to have
been in accord with the Chancellor.
Meanwhile, the answer to the council
of ambassadors relative to punitive
measures ror the I'awau ana lngoistadt
Incidents Is ready, but will not
be dispatched until Dr. von Knllling,
the Bavarian Chief of State, has consulted
his Munich associates and communicated
their views to Dr. Cuno. It
Is said, however, that tho formal
apology required by the Allies will be
forthcoming, but that it will bear the
Chancellor's signature instead of that
of Dr. von Knilling, as the council of
ambassadors demanded.
Dr. Cuno will point out that Germany's
dealings with foreign Powers
must be conducted through the Berlin
Government, that it is for him as the
head of that Government to express the
desired regrets, and not for the Premier
of one of the federated States.
With regard to the fines, totaling
1.000,000 marks gold, imposed upon
Passau and Ingolstadt, Germany's plea
will be that such a sum cannot possibly
be paid by the two provincial
towns, and that the Berlin Government
will pay.
Friction between the Germans and
the allied control commission is likely
to be increased by the discovery of a
large quantity of arms and ammunition
at Leipzig, in a municipal building.
The store includes 340 rifles. 500
rounds of ammunition, two machine
guns, two mine throwers and hand
grenades.

Fifty Passengers forced to
Jump to Save Their Lives.
Dublin, Dec. 8.?A train attack at
1 Liffey Junction, near Dublin, to-night
endnngered the lives of fifty passengers,
among them five women. A score of
men held up the train, compelled the
engineer to alight and ordered the passengers
to the rear car. They then
poured kerosene on the rest of the train,
set fire to it and started the engine.
Other men meantime tried but failed to
uncouple the rear car, which was carried
along at the tali of the blazing
train. The passengers Jumped and
saved their lives, but many were badly
hurt.
Two men. apparently students, entered
Mercers Hospital at 9 o'clock this morning,
proceeded to a ward guarded by a
police officer and ordered him to throw
up his hands. The officer raised an
alarm and was shot and dangerously
wounded. The two men who did the
shooting made their escape.

"Mr. Butler Is now engaged as counsel,"
he said, "in preventing the city of
Minneapolis from securing access to the
records of sundry bank accounts of the
transit company. Delos F. Wilcox, an
expert employed by the city of Minneapolis,
made public an official report on
June 11, 1922, based upon an examination
of tho records of the transit company.
which showed that amounts totaling
12,049,597 of profits had been devoted
to extraordinary purposes which
required investigation. The records
show that several hundred thousand dollars,
and Individual items amounting to
as much as $41,000, had been given to
various public officials and men of great
political Influence during the $?eriod
when the transit company was seeking
special favors from the Legislature of
the city of Minneapolis.
"Mr. Butler, by reason of his long
service as counsel for various corpora- j
tlons Is so completely Imbued with the i
viewpoint of these corporations and so
blind to the public interest that he j
would be unable as a member of the 1
Supreme Court to act with an unbiased j
mind.
"The appointment of Judge Gary, j
chairman of the board of directors of '

opinion, be more unfitting or improper
than the appointment of Mr. Butler. |

(Viuhlniiliiii, D. Deo. 8. (
Chairman Laaker of the Shipping
Board to-day succeeded in having the
Senate Commerce Committee strike out
the Madden amendment to the ship
subsidy bill. This will reduce the bill's
chances in conference.
In place of ths Madden amendment,
which would permit direct Federal aid
only through annual appropriations, the
Senate committee adopted the following
proposal, which was approved by Mr.
Laskcr:
"Provided that no expenditure shall
be made from the merchant marine fund
because of any Increased compensation
granted under paragraph C, section 410,
except out of appropriations therefrom
annually by Congress."
Paragraph C, section 410 of the shtp
subsidy bill, provides that after the making
of the contract of compensation the
Shipping Board may, with the consent
of the other party thereto, decrease or
increase the rate of compensation to be
paid.

Appropriations Committee makes no
secret of his fear that the elimination
of his amendment wilt mean that the
Houso will reject the bill in conference.
Even with his amendment, he points out,
the bill passed the House by only a
small margin.
Chairman Jones (Wadh.) of the Senate
Commerce Committee made a hard
fight to kill both the Madden amendment
and the substitute, but after Mr. I.asker
gave his approval to the latter he fell
In line. The aubstitute amendment was
adopted by a divided vote, he said, but
d.-cllned to tell how it stood.
Other important changes made In the
bill by the committee :
1. Limit expenditures from tho merchant
marine fund In one year to J30,000.000.
2. Strike out the tax exemption
granted to vessel owners who Invest
earnings In new ships and also -the
clause exempting front taxation funds
obtained from the sale of shiDs.
3. Insert a provision to the effect that
the Shipping Board cannot make a contract
with shipowners to extend beyond
fifteen years. The original bill permitted
contracts extending nineteen to
twenty years.
4. Provide that no application for a
contract could be refused until after a
public hearing. No public hearings are
required In cases where contracts have
been granted.
6. Keduce from 75 per cent, to 60 per
cent, the number of vessels any firm getting
Federal aid under the act shall
have under the American flag at the end
of three years after the passage of the
bill.
0. Put In provision which the House
struck out relating to the accounting
oftlce, placing the whole accountancy In
charge of the general accounting office.
Another meeting of the committee will
he held to-morrow to consider the question
of routes.
Chairman Jones expects to have the
measure ready to report to the Senate
Monday.
