"Washington, Dec. 7. Mr. John F.
Coyle, a well known veteran newspaper
man of Washington, recently indulged
in some reminiscences concerning ex-
Senator Ross of Kansas, and the im
neachment of Andrew Johnson. He
said: "Those who were not here at that
time can form but a very faint idea of
the anxiety which prevailed awaiting
the vote of Senator Koss on that ques
tion, of which no one but himself was
cognizant. With ex-Senator Voorhees I
awaited the result at my office in the
Intelligencer building, and as intimate
as Mr. Voorhees was with fcenator tos&,
lie had no knowledge of how his vote
would be cast. When the announce
ment came, we hastened to the White
House, to congratulate the president,
where we found quite a crowd of his
friends assembled, all exuberant in the
joy of his acquittal, while the president
himself was as calm as he had been
through the whole contest, perfectly
confident of the result in his favor.
"Some days after the result was
known, I called at the request of Mr.
Johnson to express his thanks to Sen
ator Ross and to tender him any favor
for himself or friends the administra
tion could bestow. Senator Ross,
thanking the president for his kindly
offers, declined to receive for himself
or friends any favor from the admin
istration. He said he voted in accord
ance with the convictions of his own
conscience, and declared he did not re
gard the president as under any obli
gation to him. He also requested me to
say to the president that anyone who
asked favors of the administration in
his name was wholly unauthorized. I
don't think he ever saw the president
after the adjournment of the senate,
when he returned to his home and soon
after renewed his occupation as a
printer.
"During Mr. Cleveland's administra
tion there was quite a contest for the
governorship of New Mexico, and
among the applicants was Judge
Trimble, of Kentucky, than whom no
better qualified person existed for any
official position the government had at
its disposal. Senator Beck, of Ken
tucky, called upon the president to add
his recommendation of his friend Judge
Trimble for the position, with many
others. In conversation with the presi
dent he learned that ex-Senator Ross
name had been presented for the posi
tion and was most strenuously urged
by the friends of the administration.
On learning this fact. Senator Beck
said: 'Well, Mr. President, if I had the
appointment to make, despite my inter
est in my friend Judge Trimble, I would
appoint ex-Senator Ross, who endured
puch persecution for the courage he ex
hibited in the conscientious discharge
of his duty in voting against the im
peachment of President Johnson.' "
It is stated that Senator Ross has re
cently published a volume of personal
reminiscences.
Ex-Senator Peffer is working away
assiduously on an index to the discus
sions in the United States congress, by
subjects. This index is to be in three
parts: Part I covers the period from
1789 to lSliS, part II extends from 1825
to 1861, while part III will include the
years from 1861 to iy03. or the termi
nation of the present congress.
The great need of such a work has
long been apparent on account of ques
tions of national and international im
portance having from time to time de
veloped, which have rendered it neces
sary for those who were called to solve
them to search for precedents con
tained in former legislative action, and
information concerning the current
public opinion expressed in former
times, as well as the arguments ad
vanced in congressional debates either
for. or against certain important ques
tions. Especially was this the case dur
ing the progress of legislation relating
to the government and control of the
colonial possessions or dependencies
resulting from the recent Spanish
American war.
The enormous amount of labor in
volved in the careful and intelligent
arrangement of this table of contents
of every report of congress since 17&9
may be more fully appreciated when it
Is considered that these reports so far
as they have been officially recognized,
are recorded in four sets of books,
namely: Annals of Congress, 41 vol
umes; Congressional Debates, 32 vol
umes; Congressional Globe, 124 volumes,
and the Congressional Record to date,
182 volumes in all, 379 volumes con
taining in the aggregate about 350.000
pages, the size of those of the Con
gressional Record.
"The first and second parts are now
undergoing a final revision, and will
be ready for the printer by the end of
the present month. The balance of the
work will be finished during next year,"
Said Mr. Peffer.
"I expect to offer my manuscript to
congress the next session at the cost
of the labor in preparing it, to be dis
tributed as a public document. I esti
mate the index will contain about 400
pages of the usual document size. The
aggregate time employed by me upon the
Index to carry it down to and includ
ing the reports of the present congress
will comprise fully two years.
"Judging from my somewhat extend
ed experience as a newspaper man. I
am confident that every editor of the
leading newspapers and periodicals
throughout the country will be partic
ularly interested in the Index and will
appreciate its value, especially when
any new and important question of na
tional character arises, such, for In
stance, as the acquisition of new ter
ritory by the government and the con
trol of the same. It will also be of
the greatest assistance to college and
ether librarians everywhere.
"The fact that the Index is separated
Into three parts, each covering a dis
tinct period of national legislation and
growtit, will enable the first two parts
to ke published at once and to become
immediately available to the public.
The third and last part may be added
t thejB wtiH completed, forming a
ULfls convenient volume"
S Put Mjr ttua "Senator Bur
ton, of Kansas, has shaved off his black
mustache. With smooth face and coal
black hair, plastered down his fore
head, he looks like an actor who is
weighed down with gloomy thoughts.
No tragedy would be too deep for him,
no situation too intense to be beyond
his reach.
"Perhaps he was an actor once, who
knows? The Congressional Directory
is silent on the subject. Burton's bi
ography only occupies three lines in
that compendium of personal informa
tion. And these three lines only state
his name, the fact that he was elected
to the senate to succeed Lucien Baker,
and that his term of service will expire
March 2, 1907. So that, if in the past
he trod the boards in guise of Richard
HI or Othello, or Hamlet, there is
nothing to prove it His actor-like fea
tures and his stately walk are only
evidences of circumstantial character,
and may, perhaps, mislead."
Dr. W. D. Bigelow (Gardner, Johnson
county,) who has for several years oc
cupied a prominent position in the
bureau of chemistry of the department
of agriculture, has been selected to in
stall the exhibit of the bureau of chem
istry at the Charleston exposition.
William Allen White the whole
literary world knows him is at The
Normandie. His purpose here is to
"write up" the opening of congress for
a Philadelphia journal.
William D. Harris, of Topeka, is at
the Shoreham. He was interviewed by
the Post and stood up vigorously for
Kansas.
Hon. James Wilson, secretary of
agriculture, is pardonably happy over
the prospect of successful efforts made
to find a natural enemy to the San Jose
scale which has proved to be such a
scourge to the fruit industry of our
country from Maryland to California
Kansas will take special pride in this
discovery because it was made by Mr.
Charles L. Marlatt (of Manhattan). who
is first assistant entomologist of the
United States department of agricul
ture. This is what Secretary W'ilson
has to say on the matter: "Ever since
the appearance of the San Jose scale in
the United States the question of itsi
original home has been a mooted one;
and, since none of the parasitic and pre
datory insects of this country seem to
be very efficient in destroying this scale,
it has become an important point to
decide, if possible, the question of the
original home of the destructive insect,
since it is quite fair to suppose that if
efficient parasites are to be found they
will be found in the original home of
the scale. The importance of this quest
can hardly be overestimated since the
damage which the San Jose scale has
done to the fruit growing interests of
the country, especially of the eastern
states, is almost beyond estimate.
"The evidence accumulating during
the past two or three years had seemed
to show that very possibly this scale
was originally imported into this coun
try from Japan, and in the spring of
the present year the assistant ento
mologist, Mr. Marlatt, was sent to
Japan for the purpose of studying the
question on the ground. Unexpectedly
to most entomologists, although not to
the entomological force of the depart
ment of agriculture it was quite defi
nitely ascertained that the San Jose
scale is not indigenous to Japan, but
that, quite to the contrary, it was in
troduced into that country from the
United States upon fruit stock at sev
eral different times and at several dif
ferent points. The most careful search
failed to reveal the scale in portions of
Japan where American plants had not
been introduced. Mr. Marlatt's travels
in the Japanese empire lasted about
five months, and having satisfied him
self, as just stated, he proceeded to
China, visiting Chefoo, the port of the
great foreign fruit district of North
China, where the industry was started
by a missionary (Dr. jNevlns) some
thirty years ago, since which time it
has extended over the province.
"At Tientsin the same condition
were found in the fruit markets, and in
the city gardens and private yards the
San Jose scale was found on a flower
ing shrub from North China. In all the
region between Tientsin and Pekin and
the Chinese wall native fruits only are
grown, and no foreign stock of any
kind has ever been introduced. Apples,
pears, peaches, apricots and plums are
extensively grown on the sunny slopes
of all the hills south of the Great Wall.
The San Jose scale in this district could
not have come from any foreign coun
try, as there have been no importations
and the fruits are all of native sorts.
The scale occurs very seatteringly, al
though generally, just as it should if
native, and is in a state of balance with
its native natural enemies. It has a
natural enemy, everywhere present and
efficient, a ladybird beetle known as
Chilocorus similis. From this evidence
Mr. Marlatt concludes without doubt
that the San Jose scale is a native of
North China. He has collected many
specimens of this efficient natural en
emy and has forwarded then to Wash
ington. Steps will be taken to estab
lish and acclimatize this important
species, and it is hoped that it will
prove as efficient against the San Jose
scale in this country as it has in its
native home. It is not beyond the
bounds of probability that this impor
tation will prove to be one of extreme
value to the fruit growers of the United
States."
The trial of Mrs. Lola Ida Bonine, who
some Kansas people are pleased to call
a Kansan because she once lived a short
time at Richmond, is now drawing to a
close in this city.
The Washington Star remarks that with
nearly $ii0 in the bank for every person
in Kansas, "the reorganization of the
Populist party may be regarded as indef
initely postponed."
Mr. B. W. Westgate, master of the
State Grange of Kansas, accompanied by
his daughter. Miss Winnifred, spent three
days recently in this cttv. He has been
traveling during the past three months
through New Kngland in the interests of
the Grange and is now on his way home
to Manhattan.
Prof. Metcalfe, formerlv professor of
elocution in the Kansas State Agricultu
ral college, is now professor of expression
in Ralston university of this city.
Although Captain William Crozier left
Kansas to enter West Point in 1S72. he is
still a Kansan. and the state takes pride
in his promotion on the 22d from captain
to brigadier general and chief of ord
nance, which appointment holds for life
or retirement. He is the son of Judge Cro
zier. who once represented Kansas in the
United States senate.
It would be interesting but probably not
pleasant to hear the remarks of the offi
cers of the army on this promotion, which
is one of merit only. The army has no
regard for a merit svstem which makes
it possible for an officer to be promoted
over the heads of those who are his sen
iors in rank. Captain Crozier is pro
moted over four colonels, six lieutenants,
twelve majors and five captains. Captain
Crozier is one of the energetic men of the
army. He is full of energy, notwithstand
ing a frail physical constitution which has
kept him on sick leave to some extent
within recent years. He and Gen. Buf
flngton are great friends, they being the
joint inventors of the disappearing gun,
carriage system, which is now in adoption
at our se&coast fortifications. It Is this
same gun carriage, the Crotzier-BurTing-ton
type, which caused so much contro
versy among the ordnance officials and
the members of the board of ordnance
and fortification.
The fact that he will by virtue of his
office as chief of ordnance become a
member of the board of ordnance and for
tification, shows that this subject of dis
appearing gun carriages will continue to
be one of discussion and controversy as it
is not at ail believed that he will recede
from his position, which was that of Gen.
BufEington that the disappearing gun car
riage is a success and should be adopted
instead of a barbette or stationary car
riage. When we read of the good work done
toward stamping out yellow fever in Cu
ba we remember that it is done -under the
direction of Surgeon General Sternberg,
and we also remember that he is a Kan
san. The surgeon general has given out
an astonishing and most gratifying piece
of news concerning the work of his bu
reau in Cuba to the effect that there was
not a single case of yellow fever in Ha
vana during the month of October, which
is usually the severest month of the year.
During the past ten years the average
number of deaths during the month of Oc
tober from yellow fever was 66.27. In Oc
tober. IStti, there were 240 deaths and 25
in 1S99, the lowest rate in the past decade.
-In October. 190, there were 30S cases and
74 deaths; but this year there was no case
of the fever there. All this great work is
accomplished by simply assuming that the
mosquito carries the contagion and the
whole opposition is to that insect. The
success of Gen. Sternberg's work is won
derful and points the way to forever keep
it out of our southern cities hereafter.
The Washington Times says: "The offi
ces of the assistant secretary of the in
terior, Thomas Ryan, and his private sec
retary, J. F. Tufts, are the rallying
grounds for Kansas people. Senator, rep
resentative, governor, literary man, or
merchant, if he be from the common
wealth of Funston and John Brown, is
sure to gravitate to Judge Ryan's office
before he has been in Washington a day.
The assistant secretary is one of the most
popular men in the state."
The secretary of war is convinced that
it is essential to the proper discipline
and education of the army that several
schools of military instruction should be
located in the west. It is understood that
these schools will be under one principal
school, which will be located at Fort Ri
lev or Fort Leavenworth. The object of
these schools is to supplement the mili
tary training received at West Point. He
will make some recommendation of this
character to congress.
Mr. Charles A. Davis of Junction City
has accepted a position in the government
printing office. He was at one time su
perintendent of the Agricultural college
at Manhattan and is one of the sons of
ex-Congressman John Davis.
Sam Foster of Marysville is in Wash
ington and will remain during the session
of congress.

THE TRUTH IN A NUTSHELL
Theo. Gillespie Tells in a. Few
Words What Smith's Green
Mountain Renovator
Did For Him.
"I have been troubled with dyspepsia
for years, which made me a physical
wreck in more ways than one weak,
nervous, and unable to eat or sleep. I
was induced to try Smith's Green Moun
tain Renovator. A few bottles com
pletely cured me, and thanks to your
Renovator, I can now eat a square
meal, sleep well, and feel strong and
hearty. THEODORE GILLESPIE,
148 No. Pearl St., Albany, N. Y.
Every day the common sense public
are seeing more and more from their
own experience, or that of their friends,
that Smith's Green Mountain Reno
vator is as unlike other medicines as
black is from white. If you are watch
ing results, you find that Smith's Green
Mountain Renovator not only benefits,
but that it cures permanently. Our
agents know all about Its merit; they
guarantee every bottle they selL If you
have not yet learned for yourself what
a perfect remedy this is,' try it at once,
and on an absolute guarantee to benefit
or money refunded.
