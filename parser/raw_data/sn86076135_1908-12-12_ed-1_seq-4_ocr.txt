EDITORIAL
THE PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE
The. synopsis of the message of President Theodore Roosevelt to
the sixtieth congress of the United States, now beginning its second
session published on another page of this paper, Is well worth the
attention of ail our readers. We believe a synopsis better than
giving the message verbatim in this case, for in each section of the
message the president elaborates upon his theme, making a long
document. Theodore Roosevelt is perhaps the most versatile man
who has ever been in the presidential chair not, perhaps, that he is
our greatest president, for Washington, Grant; the beloved man of
sorrow, Abraham Lincoln; and our late revered McKinley, all rose to
great crises in a manner which has made the name of "American"
respected by all nations. Roosevelt has not beeg face to face with,
and through, any such crises as were these men, but his attention
has been turned more to economic and business conditions and de
velopment. And In handling the peace conditions of the country he
has shown a capacity for work, a quick understanding, and a gen
eral and correct knowledge of what was going on in all sections of
the nation and in all departments of his government which
has been at once the marvel and in some parts of congress, the
despair of that body. His messages are masterpieces and fearless.
In the present message, it is significant of the absolute honesty
and fairness of the man that while making broader recommenda
tions for the protection and welfare of the laboring man than any
prior president has ever done, life at Hie same time scores some of
labor's leaders for their attack upon the judiciary of the United
States and their attempt to legalize the blacklist, the boycott and
personal violence In the name of a "strike." In no uncertain words
he states that the great Interstate corporations must be so super
vised that they observe both the letter and the spirit of the law, and
yet must be given opportunity""to develop their various Industries
to the greatest extent in a legal manner.
He states that th'e administration of justice must be prompt, and
sure, that the workingman may be on an equal footing with the
capitalist In the courts of law. And some of his most ringing sen
tences are to the efTect that in sickness, In disability, or in old age.
the man who has given himself, body and soul, to the government
service, or the service of the great corporations worn out or crip
pled himself In that service shall be cared for by those to whom
he has devoted his best years and efforts. That Is not politics, it is
not law, but it is right. It is Socialism which has been purified from
Socialism; Republicanism refined to troy weight, the utterance of a
man who feels for his fellow men.
The president's message also shows that he sees that the pros
perity of a nation is measured according to the development of
natural or acquired resources; that he sees that the natural re
sources of the United States are greater than those of any other na
tion of the world, that they must be developed, but at the same
time be developed in such a manner that they are perpetuated for
the benefit of generations yet unborn. And these resources, this
natural wealth, must be guarded so that no nation will ever try to
tresspass upon it. It is for this reason that he urges the construc
tion of a navy which can not only hold its own, but defeat the navy
of any other nation of the world, and. an army which can equally
well protect its borders. It is for this reason that he believes the' na
tional guard should be brought to the, efficiency of the regular
army, practically a huge body of patriots trained In military man
euvors and discipline, fully armed and equipped, ready at practical
ly a moment's notice to take the field, armed, provisioned and train
ed for actual combat. , All this Is not for war, but for peace. The
hanker does not leave his gold piled on his counters, but surrounds
It with Intricacies of steel, electricity, and cunning mechanical de
vices sp that the would be thief is repelled, not attracted. Our
army and navy is but a gigantic safe, warding off calamity.
Rooseveits last letter all his letters show him not to be the
Roosevelt of the "big stick," but the man of peace, but who, like a
skilled physician, applies the knife to business, political and civic
tumors, not In anger, but in sorrow; not in warfare, bnt that healing
and peace may be the ultimate result; who applies precautionary
measures rather than to try to cure after a plague has broken out.
OUR GREATEST CHARITY.
Some time ago the Tonopah Bonanza contained an editorial which
elucidated upon the hardships worked upon the Common People by
the arbitrary rates fixed by great corporations which control the mar
ket" in their respective commodities, whether It be oil, transporta
tion, or gum drops. The editorial called forth the following letter
from W. S. Miller, who, it appears from the stationery upon which
he writes and from his "official hand and seal," Is the treasurer of
the Standard Oil company, In San Francisco. We will take his
word, and the stationery, for all that. Mr. Miller's letter follows:
"San Francisco, Dec. 4, 1908.
, "Editor Bonanza:
"Our attention hus been called to an article which recently ap
peared in your newspaper reading as follows:
" 'Down on the coast, coal oil Standard Oil coal oil or kero
sene sells at 16c to 20c per gallon, according to the weight of Oily
John Rockefeller's donations to church or school. The selling rate
Is fixed arbitrarily by the Standard Oil company. In Tonopah the
Standard Oil says: "Sell kerosene at 60c per gallon." . And that Is
what Tonopah pays for kerosene. Is there legality or justice In
that?'
"You have evidently been misinformed as to the facts In this
case, and we most respectfully ask If you would not publish In your
paper the fact that the Standard Oil company doeB not make any ef
fort to control, nor can it control, the selling prices at which mer
chants sell their goods to the consumers.
"The prices which the Standard Oil company get for their Coal
oil or kerosene at Tonopah are: In Iron barrels, 26 c per gallon,
and In cases, 33V4c per gallon. The prices at Tonopah are necessar
lly higher Uian they would be on the coast, on account of the high
rates of freight. The fancy grades of kerosene, like eocene and
elalne, are sold by the Standard Oil company at 37c per gallon for
eocene and 43c per gallon or elalne.
"The prices t which these goods are sold In San Francisco can
be found In any of the San Francisco dally newspapers.
' "Yours truly, etc."
All of which reminds us of the member of the English hoiiRe of
lords, who, after some flagrant violation of the rules of that decorous
body, was required to go down on his kneeB before the speaker's
stand, and apologize to the house, else forfeit his seat. His lord
ship demurred, but finally took his medicine, gracefully, albeit

COMMENT.
WEST END MINE
WORKING HUGE
BODY OF ORE
J. F. Haley, state bullion and tax
collector, W. M. Gotwaldt, of the
Goldfield News, and a Bonanza repre
sentative, under the guidance of
Foreman Robert Christian, were
taken through the workings of the
West End mine yesterday and shown
the big bodies of ore being mined.
This Is Mr. Haley's first visit to one
of the Tonopah mines and he ex
pressed himself as being greatly
astonished at the bodies of ore dis
closed. In the drift on the first level the
ore is rapidly becoming oxidized In
character and the values are In
creasing. When this body of ore was
first encountered the values averaged
about $10 a ton, but now It will re
turn $50 a ton. At the point now
reached they are running along with
the ledge and have not as yet en
countered the foot or 'hanging wall.
The ledge has been opened up for a
distance of 127 feet and of this the
last thirty feet is of a good milling
grudgingly. But as he arose from his knees when the ordeal was
ended, he brushed the knees of his trousers, and remarked in not
inaudible tones:
"This halways was a dirty 'ouse, hannyway."
And so, in dusting our trousers after printing the above letter,
we might mention a little dream we once had not once, but many
times (and was it a dream?) of certain merchants who have been
driven out of business in the east, In the middle and in the far
west, because they persisted in selling oil which was not supplied
by the greatest of all our charitable institutions, the Standard Oil
company; of merchants who were sent polite little notices of what
might happen if they persisted in selling oil in a community, even
when that oil was supplied by the charitable institution above men
tioned, at less price than other merchants in that community were
selling the same oil.
Mr. Miller is in grave danger of being accused of not making
proper use of his time if It comes to Mr. Archbold's attention that he
took a few minutes to write to a little country newspaper In Nevada
that "the Standard Oil company does not make any effort to control,
nor can it control, the selling prices at which merchants sell their
goods to the consumers." What was the use of writing that? Does
not every one know it? Mr. Miller's sense of humor Is most subtle
and no doubt will be appreciated by our readers.
DESERVES MUCH COMMENDATION.
The action of the officials of the Tonopah and Goldfield railway In
announcing a very material cut in freight rates, to take effect Jan
uary 2, 1909, deserves the commendation of all the residents or
southern Nevada. The cut rate, coming at a time when "duirtimes"
is the cry, and when the great transcontinental roads are announc
ing a practical 10 per cent advance, Is unexpected, and at the same
time shows that the railroad is willing to do Its share toward the
upbuilding of the greater Nevada.
Wllber F. Blair, business mana
ger of the Hall-Luhrs company of
Sacramento, arrived yesterday from
the coast.
Mrs. C. J. Sadler, of Reno, passed
through this city yesterday en route
to Goldfield, where she will make a
brief visit.

grade. In a few days stoplng will be
started to connect with the Inter
mediate drift.
In the intermediate drift they
have two machines working taking
out the shipping ore. The ledge here
still retains its richness and is about
four feet In width.
On the bottom level they ars stop
lng in the No. 3 raise, where they
have cut Into a big ledge which ap
pears to be getting richer as they
proceed. A drift has been started at
a point twenty-five feet east of the
shaft that will cut the big ledge after
traversing fifty feet and then stoplng
will be commenced.
The mine has never looked better
during Its history and at the present
time has a number of huge ore bodies
blocked out for future work. The
company is also doing a little de
velopment work. It is expected that
they will soon sink another hundred
feet and from that level drift until
the big ledge, is encountered and
then work up to the 400-foot level.
