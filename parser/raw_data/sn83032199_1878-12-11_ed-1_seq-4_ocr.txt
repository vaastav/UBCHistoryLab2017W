is an empire ill wealth, power and law-
loving population. It is a mockery ol
ilurtranfl by llurtninfl ; an exhibition
of pelulcnee and uiiKurrunted iinputu
lions upon otliciK that tu'lly jars with
his proverbially char and deliberate
judgment, and it accuses bim us no
mingled eiinmng and bate eould uecure
bim, ol sell procluiiued synipathy with
a leader ot murderers, whose deluded
sluves have peopled sixteen gibbets, in
obedience to bis promptly anil willingly
signed death wari'uuls.
So grave ii.puhlie paper fro n llieCbiel
Mugislruteot t he. Slate on sogruve a sub
ject, should be aeiupulously free from
errors of fact and errors of act uation.
II is statements that "the attempt Iroin
the fust to muke political t upital out ol
the (Kehoe) cum', and to pn jmliee the
publie against the possible I'uvoruble
action of the authorities ;" that there
was " uiit'ommon anxiety to push tech.
nieulilies to exitcluehs to secure bis
(Kcboc) conviction and execution lor
a crime of filiten yeurs' standing ;"
that he "preferred loieat a lillle longer
under the imputation uhich has been
indiistriuusly eiicululed since the trial,
rulher thun erect the gallous in a po
litical campaign," and that "whatever
polilicul advantago could be gotten
from tnuking the pardon or execution
of a criminal a polilicul question, I tie-
sired the opposition to wholly enjoy,''
are most unbecoming in tbe chief ud.
minietrutnr of the laws, because ull
ure wuntitig in dignity and most ol
them essentially wunling in truth.
The only peisons who havo given
polilicul consequence to the case of
Kehoe are d'oveinor Ilartruult him
self, his ti listed and honored pulisun
friends who ore proven traders injus
tice in Hurtrafi's name, and the trim
inuls with whom they truded. On
these points we are not left to conjee
tore. The sworn testimony of John J
Slattery In tho trial of Alexander
Campbell, in Carbon county, should
havo been sudli ient of iiself, however
lightly Governor Hurlrui'ill may huve
regarded bis solemn oath to administer
the luws, to make him pause and con
template the nil lull into which he bus
fallen. Mr. Klulleiy is n merchant ol
Tuscaroro, Schuj Ikill county, enjoyed
more popular respect than any other
known member of the Mollie Mugiiires,
and was once the cuudiduto of the
Democratic party for Associate Judge
in bis county. He testified in the
Campbell case in 1876, that Kehoe pro
posed to or agreed with bim, during
the Gubernatoi ial contest between
llurlruiilt and Pershing in 1875, to
transfer tho vole of the Mollie Muguire
to Ilarlranfl for cash consideration
Major General SiglVicd, who received
bis military commission from Uariraiill
and who was then and is now the in
cumbent of the sinecure but lucrative
office ot Inspector of Boilers by the
fuvorof Uurtranft, and wes communis
cated with on the subject, and he asked
delay until be could confer with parties
at Ilarrisburg. lio promptly visited
tbe State C'u,tul and telegraphed tbe
Mollie Mugoiro contractors to meet
bim at his (Sigfncd's) borne in 1'otts
villo that evening. As requested, Ke
hoe, Slnttcry, Dunning, Chairmnn of
tho Republican County Committee,
and Judge i'.yon, met ut Sigfried's
bouso, and tho contract for tbe deliv
ery of the Mollie Maguire vole to Uurt
ranft wus then and there agreed upon
in detail, and some twelve or thirteen
hundred dollars paid to each of tho
Mollie Maguire leaders Kehoe and
Slattery. Kehoo was then County
Delegate of the Ancient Order of Hi
bernians, the highest position in the
order in the county. That Kehoe and
bis followers did support Ilurtranfl
against Pershing for Governor in
1875, is ono of tho now undisputed
facta of that contest, and that Hart
ranlt's friends lost their money by
losing quite an equal number of repu
table Republican votes in tho more in
telligent and law-abiding portions ol
the county, is abundantly demonstrated
by an examination of tho returns. One
year thcreulter, Kehoo was arrested
lor murder. Whim first arrested, he
was hilarious in his defiance of bis ae
cusers, although six distinct niurdon
were laid to his charge, hut as public
opinion asserted its sunctily for the
majesty of luw and the saluty of socie
ty, be learned thai the manipulation
of juries was ended and that bis con
demnation was probuble. It was then
that he declared bis last rcfugu his
one aourco of safety even against the
highest judgment of the law, and that
relugo was Governor llsrliunll. Mr.
George Byerly, Warden of the prison,
tustiQed in the trialof Kehoe.tbal Keboe
clared to him that "tbe old man at Har
risbnrg (Ilurtranfl) would not go back
on them." Incarcerated In prison as
a murderer, with six known murders
charged against him, and with convic
tion regarded as inevitable, be sum
moned tba plighted fuitb made lo
doubtless not by llartranft, and defied
tho law and all tbe instrumentalities
of justice.
Of these sworn declarations, mada
in open Court under the so verily of tbo
rules ol evidence and of cross-examina
tion in a capital trial, Governor Uart-
ranf. had lull knowledge, for they were
published and commented upon by tbe
puulio journals at tbo time. They
were the agencies which invested the
case of Kehoo with political interest,
and it was tho highest and holiest offi
cial duty of Governor llartranft lo ac
quit himself, If ho could, by so admin
istenng the laws as to defy theimpula
tion ol Killlical obligation, to the leader
of banded murderers. He tailed to do
so. He x ecu ltd tbe hapless slaves of
tbe County Delegate, Rome of whom
were proven to have committed their
irihicii TTriRtfrciKjo tu ftviicA . iHnv'iifi-
tory orders. There was no tremor, no
licHlatiuii, uo apuluy to criinii, when
they were consigned by bisdeulb war
runts to tbe gallows, nor did be consult
the et'imoim or the uhb or flow of pulili
eul uiuiflicti when bo nietiMircil the
number of their days. They weie
powerless ; they eouiinunJed no follow
ing ; they hail iiiieonliucls of the past,
no votes lor delivery in iboluliii'e; there
were none to timlie " political capital '
i.'.tw thuiri'a-ei,ttnil ihey uieJ unwept
mivu hy the smitten hoUNehiihl gods ot
their lowly homes, liut when the lile
of Kehoo wits to be weighed ill the
scules of jiiHtice ; when he hail been

when the full Court ol throe Judgoi

luw and the evidence, the most dis
graceful jugglery Ihut blois the admin
istration of justice in Pennsylvania,
was played between the Hoard of Par
dons and HurlruiiH losave Kehoe from'

plainly because Govurnot Hurt rault bus
tiiudo il necessary. He hud resolved,
lor reasons we cunuot ussutne to stale
lor liim, lluil Kehoe should not be ex
ecuted. His desire lo reach clemency
in the case arid escape absolute re

secret ; and tho melhod preferred was
to delay by every possible pretext un

confidential Cubiuel olllcers (Secretary
Quuy and Attorney General Lour), was
obedient to his purpo.to On January
7, 1877, the Supreme Court decided
that Kehoe had been legally and justly
condemned, and the counsel ol Kehoe,
oneof whom w usol llie Kehoe Slattery
party ut General Siglricd's home to
burier for Ilartruult in 1875, according
to Sluttery's testimony, well under
stood that delay was safety. They
inado no formal effort for purdon or
couimutution until after the death war
rant bad been issued in March and then
I hey appeared with thuir prayer for a
hearing. It was granted us they well
knew il would he ; tho denlh warrant
wus recalled by llarlrunft, and ihe
Hoard of Pardons decided by a lie vote
not to recommend clemency.
Attorney General Lear then voted
silh Secretary McCandless against
saving Kehoe, and Secretary Quuy und
Lieutenant Governor Lulta voted to
commend him to the Executive tavor.
Tim fuels ol tho case were then tein
porutcly sluted by this journal, and
ihe tiovci nor appealed to nol to, permit
the udniinistrulion ol justice to become
involved in number polilicul struggle,
us it was in 187"). Neither at thai
time, nor at any lime ihercaltcr, did
we demand llie life of Kehoo. On the
contrary wo urged the Governor lode
cide the c.tso ou its merits ; and if in
his judgment Keboe bad been convicted
mainly by reason of bis general bad
character, or by the tide of passion
thut followed the exposure of ihe ilol
lie Muguire murders, or if there was
alter discovered evidence that throw
any reasonable doubt upon the issue
of his guilt, we declined that the law
loving people of all parlies would sus
tain In in in refusing to execute Kehoe,
We begged him to dispose ol the case
manfully as Us exceptional importance
merited, and warned him tliul with tho
law unexecuted while its judgment was
unquestioned, and Kehoe in prison dur
ing a desperate partisan battle neither
the Executive nor the administration
of justice could escspo the gravest Im
putations of perfidy in tbe one or un
pardonablo weakness in both. And
this journal but spoke and appealed as
did the entire unshackled press of the
Commonwealth, and they voiced the
universal conviclionsol honest cilixens.
Hut Governor llurtrauft hailed and
turned the hopes of tbe criminal classes
of tho Slate low urd the very fountain
ol authority. Uud he halted bravely
he would have commanded respect;
but be baited, trembling us bo halted,
and counseled only with Ins fears ol
something that was undeclared to the
world. Tho Board of Pardons was
made the Utile sand pilo into which he
thrust bis bead. It was made to re
consider tho case, ostensibly to decide
whether tbe sentence should bo com
muled to imprisonment lor life just
what had been decided before: and tor
three months tbo Hoard plnyed Hurt-
ranlt's purl, by delay on various pre
texts, until .September, when a tie vole
again decided lo refuse a rcconimcndn
lion lor clemency. Heeielury Quay
having retired from tho Cabinet to be
come Recorder of Philadelphia, See re
tury I. inn had succeeded him, and
Linn, being until illed in running shuri
curves, hu relused lo follow Quay and

Atloiliey General Leal', ol liUle Use
beyond playing mlitical jumping jack,
in a beer lint, and Lear was made to
revel se Lear and lavor Ihe reprieve be
had opposed belure. Lear uud Latta
voted lo save Kehoe in September, and
Linn and McCandless voted lo execute
the judgment ot the law. Since then
until now, Ihe cuso rested with Hart
run ft, and the voles of Lucerne and
Lut'kawanua (where the Mollis Ma-
guires, although Ibrmully discarded by
the Ancient Order of Hibernians, have
recogmxed as a local institution), at
the late election, conclusively speak
tbe interpretation put upon Governor
llartranft', refusal to execute Kehoe
by tbe criminal classes of that region
Now, after having deliberately allowed
his friends "to mako political capital
out of the case," he grudgingly and
potulently and tremblingly bow, to
the law, apologir.es to crime for his
compelled respect for justice, and pours
out disjointed railing against others lo
escape from hi own infirmities.
Tb siatomcnt made by Govornor
llartranft that there has been "uncom
mon anxiety to push technicalities to ex
tremes to secure his (Robot's) convic
tion and execution for a crime of fiHoen
years' standing," lack, the substantial
attribute of truth. The Supreme
Court, to which tho rase was appealed
and ably nrged on all points, directly
Confront the rccklea, assumption of the
Executive by the unanimous Judgment

by Judge Sterrelt, says : " .
" Tho body of tbe olfense was clearly
established. There ootild bo no doubt
that l.nug'lon was murdered and the
evidence was amply siiHIcient tojiisiity
the jury ill finding Ihut the prisoner
wus one of the guilty pur tics, and ihut

l he lirsl degree. A careful review ol
(he evidence sulisties us Ihut all I lie
ingredients necessary to constitute
murder in the ti rret degree w ere proved
to exist."
Did theseveii Judgesof tlioMipremei
Court not understand the luw ? Did
they not comprehend the evidence
upon which they passed by " cnreful
review?" Kilher limy do not under
stand llie technicitlitiesot' the luw uud
the merits of thocaso us presented by
the evidence, or Ilurtranfl does not,
and which is il ? Tho only other hy
pothesis thai can p iSsiMy explain thu
dispute between the Executive and the
Supreme Court is that either the Court
or the Kxecutivo mu-t lo corrupt,
or that the Kxecutivo delibeiately ttis
cards the truth. Il be believes wbul
he asserts ho is not the firsl citizen of
tbo S'ale who has dilforol from tbe
judgments of the bighesf courts, but
Governors uro not the class from
which the people expe.l exprcs-ions of
contempt lor the decrees of ihe law.
The insolent puriisun dochtiiit on of
Governor tluruault nbotil his lefiiMil
"lo erect llie gallows in a jHibliculeum
paign," anil t hut ''whatever pditiculad-
vunltig.i coul I he goilen from making
the pardon or execution of a criminal
a political qnesiioii, 1 desired the op
position to wholly enjoy," might be
deemed not iniiripiopriatu in a rounder
wain Hireling ny u sinuii necr cuni
pilielier, but they will grate hai silly
upon the curs ol di.pn.sionste citixens,
coming from the Kxecutivo of the
State in an utturance relating lo tba
gravest duty the law cnu impose upon
u publie olllcer. They are sadly tune
less as declaration in beluilf of the
iinijosiy of publie authority, und they
elevate cuniileinneil crime, even w hen
the highest judgment of the luw bus
been pronounced against it, to a do
butnhlo plane witb justice and with
justice at llie disadvantage. They in
voku the searching criticism of the ad
minislralioii that thus sulks ut the
altar of justice when murder by the
potential partisan is to be punished.
They recall how tho prison doors
swung open for Maiaiind Dougherty
lo givo llartranft the support of cor.
nipt adverse elements in 1872 ; bow
del nuchcry ran riot in ibis cily and
fraud held high carnival to make bim
Governor; how Dougherty wus killed
by his in irderous u-s icuttes wilhm a
few months thereafter ; how Mum wus
speedly returned to prison for a mur
derous attempt upon ihe life of one of
his benefactors who hud contracted for
his deliverance, and how llurtrauft
pardoned Mara for bis second illustra
lion of bis murderous purpose, which
met and vanquished juslieo by politi
cal potvor. They remember how the
partisan organs of the Governor in the
coal regions, have been compelled to
denounce his prostitution of the pur
doning power in lulllllliient of political
contracts; how Beamish mock, the
luw and defies justice boeuuso be Is
stronger than the law ilsell, and bow
ballol-slulfors and embezzlers have
found ready barter tor clemency in ex
change for political debauchery. They
remember bow Delancy, yet in office
in tho Kxecutivo Chamber, has been
an open polilTiil broker between
justice and crime, without offense to
Governor llurlrunll; and, with these
momories quickened by the Governor's
intemperate disrespect for the courts,
the luw, for his own high office and for
himself, the letters of IliftrnnO. and
Lear will bo accepted as the wiurd
echoes of the Kehoo contract at the
Sigtried conference in 1875, and of the
Kehoe trust in llartranft that be hissed
ut tbo law through the prison bars in
187G. Tho Ancient Order of Hibernians
promptly acquitted ilsell ot the slain
of the Kehoe murderers by cutting off
from the order tho organization in the
counties of Luzerne, Schuylkill and
Northumberland; the courts havo
been fuithfiil to the law even in tbe
tempest of murder; public sentiment
bus asserted its omnipotence and made
a smirched Kxecutivo smito as he
pleaded his sympathy with crime, and
to Governor Uarlranfl and Attorney
General Lear belong the exceptional
distinction ol confessing that, but for
their tears, tho murderer would be

poixTMnyrs.
A contemporary calls attention to
thu remarkable taet that so ninny ot
Gov. II artranl't's judicial appointments
havo been repudiated by the pcnplo of
this State ut tho first opporlunity
afTorded to pass upon tbe in. It will
bo remembered that Judge Slcrrett
was defeated the first election alter he
had been appointed lo the Supremo
bench to succeed Judge Williams, ami
his successor, Fetterman appointed for
Pitt-burgh, was promptly defeated by
a Democratic candidate. In Arm
strong county, John V. Painter, up
pointed a judge by Gov. Huriranll,
wus defeated by Jackson Boggs, Dem
ocrat Charles M'Cutidless, an up-
publico of Gov. Ilurtranfl for Addi
tional Law Judge, was beaten in the
Republican district of Hiiller und
Lawrence by James Dredin. Democrat.
In Crawford county, S. Newton Pellis,
appointed a Judge by Gov. Hartranlt,
was defeated lor nomination by John
J. Henderson, who in turn was beaten
at the iloolion by Pearson Church,
Democrat. John M. Broomall, an ap
pointee of Gov. llartranft, was defeat
ed lor President Jtulgo in Delaware
county by Thomas J. Clayton, an In
dependent. In Mercer county, Win.
Maxwell, an appoiiillue of Gov. Hart
ranlt Ibr Judge, was defeated lor the
nomination by Johnston Pearson, who
was defeated by Areus M'Dcriuill, a
Democrat. Win. H. Jussup, appointed
a Judge in SnsqU' Ininna county, was
this year overwhelmingly defeated by
J B. M'Cullum, a Democrat.
Besides thesu notable condemnations
ot Republican fisiiiitinouts to the
judiciary, il is to bo remarked that the
appointed judge for tho now county ol
Luckawuima, has been prohibited Irom
acting by the Supreme Court's manda
mus; in Butler uud Mercer tho regu
lar Republican nominee was beaten by
Ebonctur M Junkin, Independent; in
the strong Iicptiblican district of Erie,
a Democratia Judge, Gulbrailb. was
elected a few years ago ; and ill Lehigh
county ihe Democrats very promptly
upset the intrigue to which llui tranll
was a party, thut be should select the
successor of Judgo Longaker; they
made a yearling of his appointee
thoro.
Although the judiciary gerrymander
of tha Stalo was intended to givo the
liepubhcuns largo advantage, the Dem
ocrats control more than half the dis
tricts, and have half the Judges in
number, notwithstanding their great
numerical disparity in Philn lelpbiu
It is gratifying lo tho Democracy lo
know that in tbo selection of candi
dates for ibis high office they have ex
orciscd such discriminating cure as ti
recommend their choice lo popular ap
