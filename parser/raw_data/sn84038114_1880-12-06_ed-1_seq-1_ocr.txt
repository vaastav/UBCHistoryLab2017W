The most shucking drowning accident
which ever occurred iu Wilmington took
ola-e Saturday afternoon when three
lids—Thomas J. Wilson, William H.
Bacon, Jr., and Jacob C. Cole, lost their
lives while playing upon the ice ou
Bh.llpot creek. It seems that shortly
after noon on Saturday a party of lads,
whose ages range between 11 and 15
years, started for tbs marshes, to play
erhat is known among the boys aa
"leather bander." In this party were
Cole, Bacon and Wilson, and William
Cloour, Robert Edwards, Sherman
Riddle, Frank Cole, Howard Bagla,
Joseph Guthrie and Harry Biythe.
Before going on the ioe they played
"shiouy," and in crossing a nluioa
Wilson broke in, but was helped out,
with no hurt done farther than reoeiv
ing a thorough wettiug. The ice was
broken around the edges and young
Clonzer laid a board across so they
could all got on the ice. They then went
over toward Pusey's ice house where a
nmnb"r of boys and girls were skating,
and they alt got on the ics and com
menoed to slide. In a little while Wil
son, Ciouzer, tbe two Coles, a lad
named Mullin and Bacon, preceoded
down the creek to Waltoa's loo house.
Ciouzer went ahead and tried the ice.
Finding It weak he came back and
managed to reach the ioe house soafTold.
Wilson and Cole concluded to go on,

rotne back, and the next moment tbe
ioe broke and Wilson aud Cole went
in. Bacon advanced to where tbe Ice
was broken. Cole had disappeared
and Wilson was struggling on the sur
face, grappling at the ke.
Young Bacon took off his ooat aud
taking it by ose sleeve threw it toward

With more presence of miud than is

Ciouzer then ran up the creek about
three quarters of a mile fer Al. Win

great trouble be broke the ioe so the
boat could float and he accompanied by
some others went out and picked up
Wilscn, who bad not sunk, but who all
this time bad be»n clinglsg to the edge
of the ioe, with his head above water.
He was nearly frozen, and was convey
ed across the fields to the nearest house
—that of Samuel Bush near Brandy
wine station. Dr. Ktables was sum
moiled, but the lad was dead from the
exposure when the physician arrived.
Samuel Weaver aud Jacob Wink, got
a boat hook aud went out again iu the
boat, in a few minutes they had re
covered the bodies of the two other
boys. Of course life was extinct for
they had been ia the water for nearly
an hour. The water in which the
boys were drowned was about 7 feet
deep. The joroner inquired into the
deaths iu the evening.

Abstract ttepnrt bribe LiiUanuil
Benue of President Uatre*.
The 1'iesident'a animal message was
mailed to all the principal cities and
placed in charge of Postmasters for de
livery to-day upon the reoeipt of a tel
graphic message from Hr. Itodgers, il.e
President's private Secretary. The
message '.- expect' d to he read toon af
ter the meeting of Congress to-day at
12 o'clock. It is the longest State pa
per sent to Congress by President
Uayes, and starts out with a view ol
the present condition of the country,
and dwells at some length upon the
rapid growth o'our National prosperity
our honntifal crops and sound financial
system, and prelkti still greater pros
perity for the future. The President
incidentally alludes to the growth of
education tbronghoat the country and to
the necessity of fostering it by legisla
tion and farther on, when rsvleariug
the report of the Commission on Kiuca
tioa, gives eome details of a plan ap
proved by him for the further devel
opment of educational facilities. The
Southern question Is treated at consid
erable length. The President expresses
satisfaction with the ontlock oi affairs
in the Southern States.
He believes that the South is etead
ly advancing in the direction ot polit
ioal freedom and toleration, and that
mbioEir* iisisef
before long tbe ballot in that section
will be as free as in the North. Ho
alio expresses the belief that tbe era of
uioodshed on account of political difler
ences has passed away, and points to
the tact that there is now less intimida
tion and violence in the South than was
practiced a few years ago. The blood
shed era kas been succeeded by an era
of fraud and misr presentation through
tissue ballots and other devices ol mis
representing tbe real etrengtb and dis
position ot tbe colored uuu. But,
while he is cheated in this way, his
physical rights are beginning to be al
most universally respected. The next
stage in Sontbern development will
soon come. This will arrive through
divisions iu the white ruling element,
and when these divisions come the
negro will be an object of protection
and interest to all political parties'
Through this division something like r.
hoicst ballot will he Secured aud rights
of all respetted. The President thinks
that education in the South will ul
timately restore the harmony between
the two sections and raise the negro to
a plan of deveiopement where ha will
be able to protect himself. It is iu this
poriion ot the Message that the Fred
dent may be said to review his admin
istratiou. Upon the Mormon qurstisn
the President uses plain language, a»d
urges Congress to adopt such measures
as will secure sperdy abolishment o;
that evil.
The President says that the fact that
so large a community lies ba;'n .per
mitted to live in open defiaatii -of fths
laws »f the United States and morality
is a national disgrace, aud one tbat
should be remedied without delay.
Congress is called upon to give early
aud earnest attention to this snbject,
that the people of Utah may be re
quired to conform to the same laws that
govern the rest of the oonutry. The
President suggests to Congress that if
there is no way of reaching polygamists
under the present organization of the
Territory that its entire system of local
government should be reorganized,with
a view of provieing a swiit and speeiy
method et prosecuting and properly
punishing all who persist iu praciioing
polygamy.
Those v?ho have credited the Presi
dent with haring become converted in
a measure to looking with leniency
open the Mormon practices through bis
resent visit West, will have their
minds thoroughly disabused by read
ing this energetic appeal to a retiring
Democratic Congress
The next sublect discussed is one that
will not attract great public attention.
It is devotsd to what the President is
pleased to call civil eervioe, and ia one
of the losgest chapters in the Massage.
After discussing the condition of our
foreign relations which were troated in
a congratulatory manner he pastes on
to consider the commercial interests of
the nation. The President does not
belisve In subridies, but he do-s
approve of giving liberal mail contact"
-to pioneer merchant marine enterprises
as one means of encouraging an indut.
Iry which, he thinks, through an
unwise policy,is need l-ssly languishing,
The next subjest Of special interest
in our foreign relations consist of a
reoital of the appointment of the Chi
nese Commission and its work,
points of these treaties are given so far
as it is proper to divulge them. At the
present time ho says that tbe first

this country. The Chinese Government
is not at all anxious to haye its sub
jeots emigrate, and was willing to meet
our Commission more than las If way in
all tho restrictions upon Chinese emi
gralion to this country suggested hy
t ie Commission,
Following this comes President Hayes'
financial chapter. Ho tabes up the
history of the Treasury Department
during his administration, and tm
bodies in his message Secretary Bher
man's ievi9W of the history of speoie
resumption He calls upon Congress
to take steps to refund the seven hun
dr.d millions of bonds that fall due
next year. Tbs oonutry ia prosperous,
business throughout the country ia on
. sound basis, while there ia a great
V-xcess of capital in business centres
that would gladly Beek a Government
loan in a much lower bond then any
of those now outstanding. Tbe Previ
deut dees not mention the rate of in-.
ti-rejt he would advise on a bond fori
refunding.
There is ns recommendation to Con
'g-eoafor the withdrawal of the legal
tender obaizoter of greenbacks, nor is!
The
there any recommendation for the etop-'„tock
page of coinage of silver dollars. The
ouly reeomraendatiou upon tht subject
comes fiom Secretary Shermau, andL
relates to tbe retminage of silver dollars
so that it will contain enough silver to
make it equal In value to tbe present
market value ot the gold dollar. The
ooet of reooinage would be covered by
profits of ths Government already made
iu the coinage of tbe silver onHioD.
Un «r tbe head of the Wsr Depart

only rn.ke-cue strong rtoommendatiou,
and that is a moat earnest approval o
Den.

necessity of strengthening our oosst de
fences at the present time. Tne PrcM
lent calls upon Convrers to take t't*
subject into consideration and to pro
vide fora system ot liberal approprfa
tions to remedy this great weakness.
The Navy Department gets but t
short ohhpter, and this for the reiser,
that Secretary Thompson asked for bui
little to be inserted in the message. U
speaks in very eulogistic terms of Bee
rotary Thompson's management, and
approves of the B9cretary's plan for tbe
encon agement of our merchant taatiif
already alluded to.
Under the Lead of the Department ol
Justice the President speaks of the At
toruey General's recommendations that
a sufficientbe appropriated by
Congress for the paymor.it of Deputy
Marshals; be also recommends thai
Congress pass some bill authorising ti..
establishment of an intermediary court
between the U. S. Circuit Court and tbe
Supreme Court, for tho purpose of re
lieving tho extraordinary pressure ol
business under which the latter is
struggling.
The President, while agreeing with
the ideas of Genesal Devens on the sub
ject, did not think it best to inoorpor
ate this recoominendation in his me.-;

of tlaesucoess ot Mr. LsDuc in his ex
periments for the growth of tea in this
country, and the manufacture of sugar
from oorn stalks. The President next
alludes to the report of the Commis
sioner of Education. The chief point
of this paragraph •( the message is the
Pieeident's recommendation that the

The education of the illiterate, both
while aud black,would have a tendency
•o plaoe me iwo sections upon a closer
intellectual level, and, consequently,
in a closer bond of union. Then fol
