The case; leaped Into national noto
riety when John 1.. McNab, then
I'nited States attorney for the north
ern district of California, resigned
rharging that improper evidence was
being brought to bear at Washington
to prevent the case from coming to
trial. President Wilson accepted his
resignation immediately, hut as yet
has named no successor. The govern
ment's case is being presented by
Matt I. Sullivan and Theodore Hoche,
special counsel, who were also re
tained for the Diggs-Caminettl cases.
On the evidence submitted to the
grand Jury the government will seek
to show that, by an elaborate system
of Bhort weights, a threefold fraud
was perpetrated.
First, that on all coal imported, the
government received less than the
rightful customs dues.
Second, that the government was
cheated by short weight deliveries of
conl sold to it for the army transport
service an J other' uses..
Third that the company kept all
engineers of the Toyo Kisen KaisOia

into barges, which were towed to the
transport docks or alongside whatever
ship was waiting to be coaled. From
the barges it was again hoisted In
board by dredge buckets.
A tally of these buckets was kept.
four out of every 60 were weighted.
and from these weights an average
was struck which It was agreed
should be charged In the reckoning
ns one bucketful.
Hut the government contends that,
whenever a bucket to be weighed was
loaded. It was filled to the brim under
the personal direction of the fore
man, whereas, between weighings,
buckets often came so light that the
bottom could be seen between lumps
of coal. On each bucket, though, the
purchaser was paying full weight.
(if course, such bare-faced frauds
could not pass unreported without
the connivance of the purchaser's em
ployes, and the testimony heard by
the grand Jury was that the company
paid a regular percentage of Its
gains to the engineers who winked at
them.
A record of these overcharges Is
show n on the company's books, it will
be argued, and the directors and of
ficers passed on statements showing
the overrun on Incoming cargoes and
the tinderrun to army transpons ana
American bottoms. On this showing
the government asks for the convic
tion of the directors, as well as the
weighers and officers alleged to be
physically responsible.

The water case has been reopened,
and so has the sewer case. Notice to
this effect has been received by the
two companies handling these branch
es of the public utilities. The public
service commission will arrive here
next Monday to take testimony and to
hear any further complaints or rec
ommendations from consumers. The
hief cause for opening the water
case Is to have a full and complete
Investigation of the matter of fire
protection with a view to Installing a
reserve fire supply and high pressure
system distinct from the regular town
service. It is assumed from previous
sessions of the commissioners that
there is little room for doubt that,
under the contract, the question of
fire protection devolves on the town
board, and at their expense. How
ever, this Is a question for the com
mission to determine. The cost of
establishing such protection Is esti
mated at between $ln,000 and $20,000.
The Improvement suggested by En
gineer Freudenberg of the commission
Is to place a lank with a capacity ol
100.000 gallons on the slope of Mount
Ilrougher and connected with the hy
drant system by a series of high
pressure pipes callable of withstand
ing a pressure of 1C0 pounds, sufll
clent to send a powerful Btream over
the roof of the Hank building.' The
recommendations Include the pur
chase of twenty-five more hydrants,
all connected with the high pressure
system.
If these recommendations are adopt
ed the town would have an unfailing
supply of water held In reserve for
emergencies and automatically re
leased on the sounding of a fire
alarm.
On the sewer proposition the pub
lic service commission will lake into
consideration the offer of the com
pany to sell their plant to the city
on an appraisement by Independent
appraisers. Complaints regarding the
use of septic tanks have reached the
commission through a firm on Main
street, which states the cellar of its
building 1b constantly flooded hy
water seeping from a septic tank In
the same block. As a sanitary meas
ure this will be checked and. If the
nuisance cannot be abated, the com
mission may abolish all septic tanks
or provide regulations under which
they may be operated without jeop
ardlzing the health of the town. Com
plaints have also been made to the
board about the maintenance of In
sanitary toilets In close proximity to
dwellings, and a peremptory order
may be Issued compelling these places
to make connections with the sewer
system or abolish the outdoor toilets.

ANTI-TRUST LAW.
Investigations of complaints that
the Sherman anti-trust law has been
violated pour Into the department by
the score each month, and come from
all parts of the country.
"In many instances," the report
reads, "the investigation has failed to
disclose factB which would justify the
Institution of formal proceedings, but
notice of the activity of the govern
ment has impelled officers of large
Industrial corporations to curtail dan
aerous tendencies. The bureau of
Investigation has looked Into thou
sands of cases of all kinds, those
concerning violations of the Sherman
law and the national banking act
averaging together more than fifty a
month.
Out of the $475,000 alloted for the
detection and prosecution of crime,
$175,000 has been Bet aside for white
slavery work, and the attorney gen
