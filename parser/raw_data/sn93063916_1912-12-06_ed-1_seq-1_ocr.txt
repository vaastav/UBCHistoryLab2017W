HIS MESSAGE 10 CONGRESS
BARELY MENTIONS SUBJECT
MOST OF THE COMMUNICATION
IS DEVOTED TO FISCAL, JUDI
CIAL, MILITARY AND INSULAR
AFFAIRS.
WASHINGTON, Dec 6 The sec
ond of a series of short messages
which President Taft has prepared
for the guidance of congress during
the short session was read in both
houses today. The message was de
voted to fiscal, judicial, military and
insuur arrairs. i
The president stated that trade
conditions in the United States were
never in 'a" better condition and that
the country was apparently well on
the war toward an unexampled period
of prosperity. He recommended re- j
forms, however, in the present bank-'
tog laws, characterizing this legis-j
lation as the "crying need of the j
country." The plan advocated by!
the president as one which would re-J
habilitate banking and currency was,
that proposed by the monetary com-1
mission in its report in February.

"CO TO HELL"
SAYS BLEASE
TO GOVERNORS
SOUTH CAROLINA EXECUTIVE
CENSURED BY CONFERENCE
EXECUTIVES OF OTHER STATES
DO NOT LIKE SENTIMENTS EX
PRESSED ON LYNCH LAW AND
MOB RULE.
RICHMOND, Va., Dec. 6 By ' a
vote of 14 to four the governors'
conference today adopted a resolution
censuring Governor Cole L. mease
of South Carolina for his senti
ment expressed recently in a
speech to the conference, on lynch
law and mob rule.
"You can all go to hell," yelled
Governor Blease when the result of
the vote was announced.
A total of 25 of the governors ex
pressed their disapproval of the
Johnson-Cameron wedding in Chicago,
Blaming the great financial inter
ests of the country for the lack of
proper "rual credit" for Ameican
farmers, and declaring that the
United States and Great Britain are
lamentably behind the . other great
world powers in taking care of their
agriculturalists. Governor O'Neil of
Alabama today told the governors
the inner history of the "rural
credit" movement. He added a,
strong plea for its more general adop
tion in this country because the
farmers are now compelled to apply
to loan brokers and private individual
and required to not only pay ex
horbitant rates of interest, but also
heavy commissions.

ANOTHER
FORGERY IS
HENRY SCHMIDT CASHES
TWO WORTHLESS CHECKS
HOTEL PROPRIETOR "STUNG"
FOR $173.75 BY FORMER CIGAR
SALESMAN WHO MADE THIS
TERRITORY.
Another check forgery, one by
which Henry Schmidt of this city
stands to lose the amounts called for
by two checks amounting to $173.75,
has just come to light through notice
ct the protest of the checks by the
Lumberman's National bank of Hous
ton, Texas.
The two checks, one for $3$ and
the other for $135.75, were givear
to Mr. Schmidt, two weeks ago by J.
E. Davis, who stopped at Schmidt's
hotel, with a woman he claimed to
be his bride, and left soon after the
checks were cashed for Miami. He
said he was on his way to Soutk
America and claimed the checks were
for salary due him.
Mr. Davis has been known to Mr.
Schmidt for the past seven years,
when he was traveling through the
state as a representative of a SL
Augustine cigar firm. About four
years ago he made his last visit to
Daytona, and from that time until
last month Mr. Schmidt had not
seen the man.
Mr. Davis arrived here ani reg
istered with his wife at Schmidt's
hotel November 22, telling Mr.
Schmidt he was married in Boston
ten days previous to the day of their
arrival. The couple remained at
the hotel until Nov. 25, when they
left for Miami, saying they would
stay in the Magic C ty tor a tew days
and then-proceed 10 South America,
for a month's stay, and that they
wiould return to Daytona January 7.
Mr. Davis represented himself as
aj past exalted ruler of the St. Aug
ustine lodge of Elks and during the
time he was at the hotel here re-
ceived by maiU as Mr. Schmidt saw
him take it from the envelope, a
check for ? 135.75, dated at MMville.
Texas, Nov. 15, 1312, and drawn by
Meyers Brothers & Co. on the Lum
berman's National bank of Houston,
made payable to J. E. Davis. The
man explained to Mr. Schmidt that
the check was for salary due him and
the paper, as the smaller check had
been previously, was cashed by Mr.
Schmidt. .
Mr. and Mrs. Davis left here
November 25 for Miami, leaving the
hotel proprietor in blissful ignorance
that the checks cashed were worth
'ess. Last Sunday Mr. Schmidt was vis
ited by a Burns Agency detective,
who was hot on the trail of Mr.
Davis, and had been following him
for several days in the state of Flor-
I ida, trying to capture the man for a
check forgery in Atlanta.
