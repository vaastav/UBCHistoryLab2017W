MR. UNTERMYER 'AND MR. GRACE.
A STRIKING SCENE in the world drama of
industrialism was staged in the Aldermanic
Chamber Wednesday when Samuel Untcrmycr in
terroaied Eugene P. Grace.
.Mr. Grace is President of "Bethlehem." Mr.
Untermyer is the largest single stockholder.
Mr. Untsrmyer advocated collective bargaining '
and unionization of workmen.
Mr. Grace is willing to go to any length in op
position to these principles.
In this conflict of opinion, if we go beneath the
surface, we find one of the great basic factors of
modern industrial life. Mr. Untermyer typifies
ownership of industry. Mr. Grace typifies man
agement. The two do not always agree.
If Mr. Untermyer owned and managed one or
more of the Bethlehem plants or subsidiaries, it is
fair to suppose that he would put into effect the
policies lie advocates. He would be in touch with
his labor forces, would know what his workers
wanted and would probably grant what was asked
without the need of an elaborate union organization.
Instead, Mr. Untermyer merely owns a fraction
of all the. plants. He manages none. If he disap
proves of Mr. Grace's- management he is helpless
uness he can persuade a majority of the ownership
to cither discharge Mr. Grace or force him to change
his policy.
Mr. Grace is the representative of a union of
employing capitalists. These capitalists are out of
touch with the labor they employ. Hie workers
have no avenue to reach the humanitarian instincts
of the real employers, such as Mr. Untermyer. Mr.
Grace stand's in- the way.
When every owner was his own employment
manager there was real competition in employment
Each owner had to treat his employees fairly or
they would go to a competitor. He was In pos
' tion to know whether the treatment was fair.
The corporation the union of capitalist employ
ersmade the union of employees essential.
'Hie Very conflict between Mr. Untermyer and
his Hired Man, Mr. Grace, is itself one of the best
reasons a labor organizer could advance to justify
the unionization 8f labor for 'the purpose of collect
ive bargaining.

The G. O. P. needs a Board of Co-ordination.
Hew will Mr, Mondoll'B suggestion chock up
with Senator FaU'n determination to conquer
Mexico. War Is expenalvc, oven war apalimt
Mexico.
BURGLARY AND BANDITRY.
BURGLARY and banditry have flouiished this
week. So much so thait seems evident no
working agreement between the police and the un
derworld exists.
Of late we have heard frequently, that the "crime
.wave" is a pure figment of the Imagination.
If burglars and bandits were friendly with Com
missioner Enright, they would have taken a short
holiday to help him prove his contention.
But they have not.
Instead, the crime record forms an almost ironi
cal commentary on the 'Enright statement. The
burglars and bandits seem bent on proving the
Commissioner in error.

According to Commissioner K.nrlslit'B own
BUtMiyoat, moro than oiie-sovenlh of tho
pollcotnou voted "No'' on tho pollen hospital
question In splto of "orders from Headquar

of the traffic in women.
One more Anti-League lie nailed and clinched..
PENROSE POINTS
TO THE SOURCE!
SENATOR BOIES PENROSE, one of the big
gest Republican bosses that ever dictated party
policy in or'but of Congress, now steps forward to
warn the country against impending doom.
"The situation," declares the Senator, "is appall
ing. It cannot be exaggerated. We are rapidly
reaching the point where men must sit down in the
cold light of reason, without any illusions, and reach
a solid basis. We cannot continue for, many months
to go on as we have been doing."
"Perhaps tho principal source of all the Ills
which are llkoly soon to break, over the
country Is overtaxation.-
"Prompt reltet must be afforded by Con
gress." Is Senator Penrose prepared to explain why a
Republican Congress could not have afforded some
of this relief during the past two years?
If the country was being overtaxed, the remedy
wuld come only from Congress, and Congress was
controlled by Senator Penrose's party.
Why didn'i'the Senator from Pennsylvania and
his Republican confreres sit down "in the cold light
of reason, and without any illusions," to determine
how they might best serve their country when tliis
Sixty-sixth Congress met a year ago?
Why didn't they listen in a spirit of patriotic help
fulness to the President's message to Congress in
December, 1919, in which lie laid stress on the
"immediate necessity" for tax revision and on the
peril of continuing taxes which "discourage energy (
and remove the incentive to new enterprise"?
Senator Penrose lays the present ills of business
to overtaxation.
Who is to blame for the overtaxation if not Sen
ator Penrose and oilier dictators of the Republican
Party who refused to sanction any programme of
tax relief until they had capitalized their country's
need to help elect a Republican President?
That is the Republican record of patriotism dur
ing the period when the American people were suf
fering for want of reconstructive aid from their
National Legislature.
It is "a record which Senator Penrose cannot blot
out, though he shed rivers of crocodile tears over
perils that now threaten..
All these months of vain wailing for tax revision
in order that a' Penrose may mount the platform of
secure Republican victory, tell the Nation it is over
taxedand try to persuade it Us best hope lies in a
new protective tariff I

UNCOMMON SENSE

DON'T WAIT TO BE TOLD.
The niuii with initiative doesn't wnit to be told. He
bccs what is to be done and docs it. And when other people
discover this trait in hitji his future is pretty well assured.
It is the faculty of initiative thut fills the positions of
general managers, general attorneys, ir6sidcntsJ superin
tendents and all highly paid executive plaees in the world.
It is the faculty of initiative that makes Inventors,
authors, artists nnd orators.
The man who is looking for .something that can be done
will both find it and 4 it Tho mnn who never does any
thing till he is told to do it, and who never docs that until
he is told how to do it, may be honest and faithful and in
dustrious and loyal, but he is very likely to spend hlsSife
wondering how he will ever raise the mortgage from his
house. '
Like everything else that is valuable, initiative is
neither usual nor easy to come by. The proportion of men
who are born with it arc very few. And mnny of these are
so easily discouraged by their fellows that they lose their
initiative as soon as they find out that employing it gen
erally means a battle of some kind.
let initiative is a quality that can be cnltivatetl. More
' than that, it is a quality that must be cultivated if you expect
to amount to more than the millions and hiillions of very
ordinary people who populate the world.
You can begin to cultivate it in any working environ
ment. Do the work that you are told to do, and then lwk
around to find other work that vou have not been told to do
but which it is possible to do. Keep your mind on your job,
nnd when .you find a better way to do your work adopt that
way without waiting for somebody else to tell you to.
Look about for opportunities to prove that you aro bet
ter than the boss thinks you are. When you find them
make use of them. The boss may be an individual or n cor
poration.- It makes no difference which, lour importance
will be measured by your usefulness, and eventually your
income will be the measure of your importance.
Work, intelligently and as swiftly as is consonant with
good work. Hut, above all, keep your eyes open for chances
to do your work before you nre told to do it. If you can
do that, and do it continuously, you will soon be pnst won
dering whether or not you arc going to get along in the
world.
