WELL ANSWERED
Recently there' oppeared in the
Gardnerville Record-Courier some
correspondence, presumably furnish
ed by a Carson man, in which the
- suggestion was made that Nevada's
representatives were remiss in their
duties because they had not intro
duced a bill in congress asking the
government to turn the old mint
building in this city into a jail. The
Sparks Tribune got hold of the item
and replies to it in the following
splendid manner:
. "'Alas, poor Yorick!' The begin
ning of the end. It is indeed lament
able to think that any citizen of Car
son could be found to advocate the
turning of the United States mint
building at Carson into a common
jail for the reception of down and out
vagrants of the selling whiskey to
Indians kind or otherwise. And that
a Carson man goes further and re
flects on the architecture of the
building which is very unkind at this
late day.
"That building which the Carson
. man says 'looks like a jail' has a his
tory that makes it one of the most
historical in the state.
"Throughout different political od
ministrations that building that 'looks
like a jail' housed under its roof a
small army of men and women en
gaged in turning out the coin of the
realm. Bullion from all parts of the
state of Nevada and not a little from
other states was sent to -that 'looks
like a jail.' Loaded on flat cars of
the Virginia and Truckee from the
great Comstock lode bullion was sent
by the ton and dumped off the cars
like so much pig iron on the lot op
posite 'looks like a jail where it was
picked up and taken to the refinery
and parted into gold and silver, af
ter which it was sent back to the
melters and refiners and turned into
money. And today' the small pro
ducers are sending their bullion to
that house that 'looks like a jail' for
which they receive coin or govern
ment checks. And now another conation-,
presents itself. Silver, is
steadily going up. New prospects are
being developed daily which will add
. to the gold and silver production of
Nevada, every ounce of which should
be sent to the Carson mint if the
producers are true," loyal Nevadans.
Instead of aUowing that house that
'looks like a jail' to become a jail,
every -citizen of our growing and
prosperous state should get busy and
Insist on rehabilitation of that Unit
ed States mint."

NO HEBREW-AMERICANS
Jacob H. Shiff, the big New York
banker, said in a recent address to
the Young Men's Hebrew associa
tion: "Young men, I say to you, it's a
parting of the ways. We Jews have
to choose whether we want to be
Jewish-Americans or American Jews.
And God forbid that we permit a hy
phen to be placed between Jew and
American. God forbid that it be said
that the Jews form "a group by them
selves. We want to be united rs
Jews, but by our religion only."

WORDS THAT MEAN SOME
THING The Reno Gazette calls President
Wilson's message "words, words, i
words." Words they are, Dave, but
if we could use them like Wilson does
no pent-up print shop would confine
our powers or curtail our ambitions.
The Elko Independent recently of
fered an apology to the Sparks Trib
une for swiping one of the latter's
articles and failing to give credit.
The Appeal has quit cqunting the
number of apologies due this paper.

GET THE HABIT HERE'
In Sacramento they have a "Buy
It Now and Buy It In Sacramento"
movement and the stores are already
beginning to feel the influence of the
campaign. Stephen S. Day, manager
of the Crane company, has the fol
lowing to say regarding the move
ment: "If every one would acquire the
habit of buying it here and buying it
now, which means buying it when
you need it, the merchants of this city
would be able to carry even more
generous stocks and make even bet
ter displays of their stocks, because
they would have the assurance of all
the support of the home people in
stead of just the support they cannot
help giving them. This condition
would lead to more advertising
which in turn would result in more
buying, and consequently t!re would
be an endless chain of added advan
tage and prosperity for the home
town."
This is just as applicable to Car
son as it is to Sacramento and i
Carson people would orjly waken to
the fact that each dollar spent at
home makes the town and its people
that much more prosperous and in
the end makes the spender of the dol
lar more prosperous.
PRUSSIANISM IN LONDON
If the British government is t."
adopt the tlfreat of Home Secretarj
Simon, let it take down its sign. It
has claimed thus far to be fighting
for liberty in$ democracy in Europe.
There can be no liberty and democ
racy in a nation where the press is
not free, says the New York World.
It may be admitted at once that
the Northcliffe newspapers have been
irritating and .at times perhaps fool
ishly so, and jet they have been a
prodigious force for good. They
have not confined themselves to crit
icism. They have spurred ministers,
legislators and people to duty. If
they have recognized danger and
found fault, so also have they ap
plauded triumph and patriotic ser
vice. To suppress the Northcliffe news
papers would be to put Great Britain
on all fours with Prussiaiisi. The
London censorship is worse than
that of Berlin, for it is the clumsy
arbitrary work of people unaccus
tomed to sich methods. All that is
now needed to complete the over
throw of public opinion in an empire
once ruled 'oy that alone is to add to
the terrors and errors of the censor
ship the summary seizure of presses
that are not altogether in the service
of the ministry.
Symptoms such as these are not
encouraging for democracy in Eng
land, in Europe or anywhere else.
Democracy cannot be sustained on
the tefms and conditions of despot
ism. It is perhaps conceivable that
a shackled democracy might win a
war against absolutism; but disaster
would attend the triumph, and in all
the essentials of life victor' and van
quished would be alike degraded.
KNOWS WHY? ALL RIGHT
Germany will not be very insistent
in its demands to know why Presi
dent Wilson and Secretary Lansing
have given Captains von Papen and
Boy-Ed their conge. They probably
know more about the matter across
the ocean than we onj this side do.
But in what the president and secre
tary of ' state have done they will
have the support of the whole Ameri
cean people, except, perhaps, the edi
tors of a few Republican papers in
Nevada.
