Accoidlng to tho report of tlio Secrotnry
of tho 'Treasury tho receipts of tho
Government for tho fiscal year ending
Juno 110 last word $370,200,07-1.70, Tho
expenditures wero $230,l)S:i,0oS.0l)( leav
ing a sulpltwof $110,012,110.00; of this
$ 10,077,105.83 was expended in tho pur
chase of bonds for sinking funds; for tho
redemption of fractional ctnrency, loan
of July nnd August, 1801, loan of 18GS!,
nnd other old accounts, purchase of
bonds of '81 and 1007, and premium on
loans of those yenru, 883,0S-1,400.01 was
expended, leaving b.ilnnco in tho Treas
ury of $00,027,710.08. Thoro wns t; net
increase over tho receipts of tho preced
ing year of $7.S02,07. It is estimated
that the roventtes for the present llscul year
will amount to $'177,000,000. Tho ex
pciulituies tiro estimated nt $2711,000,000,
leaving an estimated surplus of $10,000,
000, Upon tho subject of surplus reve
nues tho report says:
Upon tho basis of appropriations recom
mended by tho Department and upon tho as
sumption that tho lovctntes of tho fiscal jeara
to tlio cud of Juno !J0, 1SS0 nnd 1800, will bn
equal, tho surplus rovenbesfortho latter ilscal
jear will bo $101,000,000, which, with tho sur
plus ruvenucs of this year and the surplus
already accumulated, inalto n total of $"528,
000,000, which inlsrht bo Used during the nct
nineteen months in tho purchase ot tho In-torct-bearIng
debt, aud which ouslit to bo
used for that purpose, unl ess tlio laws are so
clinmrcil as to riduco tho dlffcicnco between
expenditure and icvoiiuo by nearly that sum.
About $183,000,000 of tho 4J per cent, bonds
aroiiowootstaudluff. Thuv aro payablo Sep
tember 1, 1831. Tho total amouut of Interest
wblch will accrue on them from now until
their maturity Is, In round numbers, $2.j,000,
000; consequently, the present surplus and tho
surplus which will probably nccruo before
Tuly 1, 1890, will sulllco to pay the principal
of those bonds and nil tho Interest which
would accruo upon them should thoy bo per
mitted to remain unpaid until their maturity.
The print lp.il ot tho four per cent, bonds In
now $GS0,0O0,O0O, and tho Interest which could
nccruo upon them until their maturity In 1907
Is about $500,000,000; a calculation will show
that tho present surplus revenues, If contin
ued, would pay beforo 1900 all of theso four
per cent, bonds aud nil of this Interest. Of
courso all tho monoy which Is saved by pur
chase of bonds nt less than .the pride I pal and
the Interest to accruo but shortens tho tlmo
whon nil tio bonds may bo paid If tho holders
will surrender them.
Nothing Is moro needed than tho foregoing
statement to show tho ubsoluto necessity of n
readjustment ot tho public rovmucs nt tho
earliest possible date.
That It will bo necessary to pay nearly tho
wholo of tho Interest which will accrue upon
tho public debt If nn attempt 13 mado to Invest
the present stuplus icvcnucs In It beforo Its
maturity Is evident from tho fact that oven
now tho Government Is pajlng for tho four-and-n-half-per
cent, bonds a prlco which real
izes only about one-and-a-half per cent, annu
ally, and receives but meager offerings of
them nt that prlco.
To contlnuo taxation with no other uso for
Its proceeds than such an Investment Is a cruel
waste of tho pcoplo's monoy.
Tho danger from n continued nnd ex
cessive coinage of tho silver dollar, in tho
Secretary's opinion, still exists. Ho be
lieves that tlio amount of sllverowncdby
tho Government should bo fixed at a cer
tain sum, and that when this amount is
exceeded by $0,000,000 tho purchaso of
silver bullion should ceaso until tho
amount owned by the Government should
bo again reduced to such maximum, or
by canceling United States notes to tho
amount of tho execis over tho maximum,
ju-flyided tlio Government held tho notes;
if not, thon by censing tho purchaso of
bullion.., ,v
Tho report earnestly urges n roform of
certain abuses in tho customs administra
tion, points out tho incongruities of tho
taiiff schedules, and recommends a lino
upon tho masters of vessels biinging im
migrants hero In violation of tho laws.
It is recommended that thn customs nud
Internal rovenuo services bo amalgamated
Into ono and mado non-partisan. Tho
Dxccutlve ordor placing all tho employes
of tho Bureau of Kugtaving nnd Printing
but watchmen and laborors in tho classi
fied civil service will doubtless result In
nn Improvement in tho service. Tho
business of tho Department has beon
kept well In hand and tho arrears of
work found nt tho beginning of tho year
mostly cleared away.

tho President's messngo: '
"Tho American has nover believed
that Mr. Cleveland would abato ono jot

Ho know when ho penned his celebrated
tariff messugo tho dangers of tho con
flict which ho invited. Ho knows that
his defeat does not make truth a false
hood or lessen tho evils of nn tin
wiso system of taxation. Tito mes
sage is woitby of tho man and
of tho occasion. It dwells with curueBt
ness upon tho Injustice-of excessive taxa
tion; upon tlio radical departuro from
tho rules which limit tho right ot taxa
tion, and effectively presents tho result
ing evils of extravagant expenditure of
Federal money, regardless of tho limita
tions of tlio Constitution. Tho tone of
tho messngo throughout is dignltlcd,

President's messago means "I am right and

Inconsequential document.
Tho 1'ieis sajslt Is the offortof a shallow
demagogue to create ill-feeling between

Tho IWoune ea)s It Is an attempt to stir up

Tho jferahl sajs that Mr, Cleveland's re

voice of ouo cry Inc in the wilderness. Tlio
people havo elected a party which favois mo

The Timet thinks tho President has somo

which tbv country will bo compelled to irlvo

Pconlo who rido to Georgetown on tho
Avenue ears may havo noticed tlio llttlo
row of dingy brick houses tlio cars pass
on Twenty-sixth street as thcytuin to eo
tip from tho Avenuu to tho .M-slicct
bridge. t ,
They aro three-story housc3,tkough tho
lower ono of tho stories wore left under
ground when tho leVce of tho street was
raised. t
The southernmost of thoso houses, No.
1128 Twenty-sixth street, in rather
brighter looking than its neighbors, hav
ing been given a coat of! red paint not
more than four or fivo years ago, This
houso was ft week ago last Saturday
night tho pcono of a supposed murder
that just camu to tho nolico"of tho police
last nlelit throuch tho death of the vic
tim. Bob Hughes.
Ills house, No. 1128, is n interesting
ono. Tho lower story, tho celling ot
which is just on a level of tho street, is,
or wns, a "crap den" of the liveliest sort.
This lower floor, or cellar, Is reached
by a flight of rickety wooden steps that
run down from ono sldo of a wide atca
way to tho other.
Tho arcaway is the full width of tho
iiouso aud extends somo eight or ten feet
from the houso's front wall, furnishing
scant lights to tho cellar w iudows.
It was in this collar that tho craps were
shot by n crowd of dusky gamblers, and
tho dead man, Bob Hughes, is said to
hn-vo derived tho mengro incomo neces
sary to support himself aud his family
from tho "Kitty" that formed nn im
portant ndjunct to all tho games. Tho
second floor, tho ono on a lino with tho
street, is i cached by a sort of rickety
brldgo thnt spans tlio dcop arcaway and
rises from tho brick pavoment by a
single step.
This lloor is used ns tho living room
of tho dead negro nnd his family, con
sisting of his mother, Becky Hughes,
and sister.
The third floor, with its two pairs of
battel cd shutters, looking out over
Twenty-sixth sticet, was occupied by
Mrs. Alexander aud her daughter, Kate.
This Kate Alexander, n rathpr comely
brown woman, about 20 years old, had
n lover who was not popular with her
mother, or, in fact, with any of tho in
mates of tho houso at No. 1128.
Her lovnr was Wayman Brooks, n 88-year-old
black man, with a scrubby
mustacho nnd strnggliug sldo whiskers.
Wayman is a pollcv man. Ho fre
quonts tho crap resort fn Hughes' cellar,
and ho loved tho dnughter'of the woman
who rented tho top floor pf Hughes'
houso.
Bob Hughes hnd a lovo affair of his
own, too. His inamoratta was I.ottlo
Boyd, BrookB wife's daughter, a good
looking young yellow girl, who had
nursed him ever sinco his, fall that To
suited in his death last night.
TUB bTOriV'OlP TlUl.fcjtAQKUY. I
A t"wcok ago last Sattlrday night, at
about 0 o'clock, Bob Hugllcs went out of
(ho door from tho second, lloor of his
house. t
Brooks was outside, anil after ft mo
ment's conversation tho hitter was heard
to shout: "Por God's sako, bring a light,
somobody." . j
Mrs. Hughes camu out with a light in
her hand, and found Bob lying in tho
area at tho foot of tlio lllght of btairs
leading to tho cellar door; groaning with
pain and all but unconscious. No ono
was with hlin whon lie fell but Wayman
Brooks, who helped carry him to tlio
hecond story of tho houso, where he died
last night.
Mrs. Hughes nnd tho sister both say
that ho had told them but a few minutes
before to got ready and ho would take
them out and buy each of them a mucli
needed pair of shoes. They say ho hnd
$0.50 In his pockets. Alter ho was

senlatlvoof The E lw'ino Post for his
opinion of the President's Message. With
tho deliberation which is chnrncteristio
of nil his Utterances, Mr. Ingalls said:
"The most painful fcnluro of the mesugo
to mo is tiio aluenso of ult ntlttslou to
Civil Sen-loo Itcform. The messngo
differs from that which tho President
sent to Congress a year ago in dealing
ns it doe with moro than ono topic. Tho
Kxccutivo hori.on has evidently been
bioadened. Tho campaign of intelli
gence, which Just closed, appears to
navo Instructed . tho President. Ho
knows moro than ho did n year ago, On
the Utl iff qtlcstiou liis courage is muio to
be commended than Ids disci etion. If
tho Pu'sidcnt felt any resentment nt that

ho has concealed it, and if lie felt any
irritation nt tho notion of Iho Senate in
relccllng tho Fisheries treaty, ha does
not show it. I'nm inclined to suspect
thnt tiio President's imperturbability is
so perfect Hint it is not attributable en
