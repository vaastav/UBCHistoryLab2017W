THE NECESSARIES OF LIFE.
Manifestly il we are to aid the peotile di
rectly through tariff reform one of it* most
obvious features should be a reduction in the
present tariff charges on the necessaries of
life The benefits of such a reduction would
be palpably and substantially seen and felt
bv thousands »ho would be better clothed
and better fed and better sheltered. 1 bese
gifts should be the willing beueia. tors or a
government the function of which is the pro
motion of the welfare of the people.
TO HELP M AN V FACT V RING lNlUtSTKIES.
No less closely related to our people's pros
périt v and »dl being is the removal of the
restrictions upon the importation of raw ma
terial neeeesnry to our miiuutaciurer. Lue
world should be open to our national ingenu
ity and enterprise. This can not be while
federal legislation through the imposition of
a high tariff forbids to American manutac
turers as cheap materials us those used by
their competitors. It is quite obvious that
the enhancement of the prire of our manu
factured products resulting from tins poney
not only confines the market for the-« prod
ucts within our own borders, to the direct
disadvantage of our manufacturers, lmt also
increases their cost to our citizens.
THE 1NRKBESTS OF LABOR.
The interests of labor are certainly, though
indirectly, involved in this feature of our
tariff system. The sharp competition and
active struggle among oui manufacturers to
supply the united demand for ilieir goods
soon fills the narrow market to which they
are confined. Then follows n suspension ot the
working mills and factories, a discharge of
employes nud distress in the homes of our
workingmen. Even if the oftou disproved
assertion could be made good l hat a lower
rate of wag«» would result from tree raw ma
terial and low tariff duties, the intelligence
of workingmen leads them quickly to dis
cover that their steady employment if per
mitted by free materials, is the most impor
tant factor in their relation to tariff legis
lation.
Till; HOUSE TARIFF BILL.
A measure has been prepared by the nppro
embodying

tariff reform on the lines herein suggested,
which will be promptly submitted for legisla
tive action. It is the result of much patriotic
and unselfish work, and l believe it deals with
its subject as consistently and thoroughly as
exist ing conditions permit,. 1 am saii-Hed
that the reduced tariff duties provided fur in
the proposed legislation, added to existing
internal revenue taxation will within the near
future, though perhaps not immediately,
produce sufficient revenue to meet the needs
of the government.
INTERNAL REVENUE TAXATION.
The committee, after full consi'.«'ration,
provide against a temporary defi
ciency which may exist before the business
of the country adjusts itself to the new tariff
schedules. Imre wisely embraced in their plan
a few additional internal revenue taxes, in
cluding a small tax upon incomes derived
from certain corporations,
mtiits are not only absolutely just and easily
borne, but they have the further merit of
baing such as can be remitted without unfa
vorable business disturbances whenever neces
sary. their imposition no longer existing.

LET US HAVE COMMERCIAL
In my great desire for the success of this
measure l cannot restrain the suggestion
that its success can only be attained by
means of unselfish council ou the part of the
friends of tariff reform and as a result of
Theirwidingness to subordinate personal de
sires and ambitions to the general good.
The local interests affected by the proposed
reform am s > numerous and so varied tiiat
if all insisted upon the legislation embodying

' In conclusion, my intense feeling of respon

FALLS INTO THE CRAVE AND DIES
Walter II. Fish Found Dead at His
Daugliter-ln-Law's Funeral.
Rochester, Pa., Dec. 2. —There was
the most singular occurrence at the
funeral of Mrs. William Shell in the
Beaver cemetery today. The grave was
dug by Walter W. Fish, stepfather of
the deceased lady. The grave was dug
vesterday. It was necessary, however,
for Fish to go to it today in advance of
the funeral to set the rough box in posi
tion. Just as the funeral procession
arrived at the cemetery James Hrother
ton curiously looked into the grave and
saw Mr. Fish lying in the rough box.
Epon investigation it was discovered
that Fish was dead. Undertaker Reno,
who was on the hearse, was notified and
kept the mourners in the carriages and
in ignorance of what had occurred.
Aided by the pall-bearers, Fish's re
mains were removed from the grave
and taken away. The funeral then pro
ceeded without the wife or family know
ing the father's fate. Upon their re
turn home they were apprised of the
facts. At the coroner's inquest it was
discovered that Fish's neck was broken.
The accepted theory is that Fish stum
bled and fell into the open grave, frac
turing his spinal column. Mr. Fish was
60 years old.
On Trial tor Robbing Ctsr*.
Helena, Dec. 2. —The trial of Joseph

quite a large audience, and among the
most observed Is C. F. Smtth, the man
who left Helena so suddenly last Sep
tember, and was found by Detective
Kilgore in Houston, Texas. There are
several in the gang accused of looting
freight cars of merchandise.

,
Washington. Dec. 6. —A spirited dis
cussion on the Hawaiian question oc
cupied the senate. Debate arose over
the resolution offered yesterday by
Senator Hoar, requesting the president
to forward to the senate all correspon
dence on the Hawaiian question.
Senator Hoar said if the president's
message meant anything it meant that
the president was meditating the ques
tion whether he should by his own
executive authority commit an act of
If that
war against a friendly jower.
was apparently proposed to be done it
had not been done yet. Senator Hoar
desired that the swift and indignant re
monstrance of the American people
should make itself felt and heard.
Senator Mills opposed the resolution,
said the president had not overstepped
the limit of executive authority and
alleged that the only question presented
was did the rnpublican government in
terfere and overturn the existing gov
ernment of Hawaii! If it did, it was
the duty of the people of the United
States, represented in the government,
to make restitution and reinstate the
government which it had overthrown.
Mills asserted that the entire Hawaiian
difficulty had arisen because the sugar
planters cf Hawaii wanted to obtain a
bounty on sugar to be paid them out of
the pockets of American citizens.
Senators Viias and Gray upheld the
president and a lively tilt with Senator
Hoar followed, Vilas declaring that
whit the president had instructed the
minister to do he had ample authority
to do.
Senator Hill of New York agreed with
Senator Hoar and thought the American
people were entitled to all, information
at hand upon the subject. It had been
said that instructions had been given to
Willis, and it was inferred that force
might be used to restore the queen to
the throne. There were three depart
ments of this government and the exec
utive department was but one of them.
There weie reasons why this informa
tion should be given now. Perhaps at
this moment, possibly at this very hour,
the navy of the United States, co-oper
ating with the United States minister,
was seeking to destroy the provisional
government by force, and that was a
question the propriety of which should
be determined by cpngress.
Senator Sherman favored the passage
of the resolution. There was no reason
for secrecy. If United States military
force were used to restore the Hawaiian
monarchy it would be a fatal act of pub
lic policy, a great injustice to the whole
people of the United States, and almost
an insult to congress. Congress was a
law-making power. The president had
no right to declare war or to do an act
of war. or precipitate the country into
a controversy of this kind.

recess of an hour to enable the com

retary Prüden delivered the message
to the vice-president, who laid it be
fore the house, and Secretary Cox at
once began its reading.
All present, with few exceptions,
gave the closest attention when the
reauing was begun. Dolph gave at
tention to his file of bills for a few
moments, but he pricked up his ears
as the reading reached the Hawaiian
paragraph. There was a general
changing about in seats of the senators
when that portion of the document
dealing with Hawaii was reached.
Many senators had. however, antici
pated the secretary's reading by turn
ing to their printed copies.
Dolph immediately rose and said
there had been distributed in the sen
ate printed copies of what purported to
be the message of the president, in
which on page nine, he found a part of
a page devoted to Hawaii. Hs did not
hear that portion read from the desk.
He desired to know, and thought the
country did also, whether that part
was inadvertently or purposely omitted
by the secretary, or whether the copies
which had been circulated were not
true copies of the message.
Tne vice president responded that
that portion of the message relating to
Hawaii had been inadvertently omitted
by the secretary, and directed that it
be read. The message was ordered to
lie on the table.

BANK DIRECTORS CENSURED.
Scathing; Rebuke Administered by the
United States Grand Jury.
Helena, Mont., Dec. 2 —The report
of the United States grand jury and
accompanying indictments made up a
mass of nearly 300 typewritten pages.
The report consisted almost entirely of
condemnation of the methods of direc
tors and officers of the suspended Mer
chants National bank of Great Falls,
the Livingston National of Livingston
and the Stockgrowers National of
Miles City.
Four more indictments
were returned against Will Hanks,
president of the Merchants of Great
Falls; others against Henry F. Bachel
lor, president, C. L. Meriil, assistant
cashier and C. R. Middleton, director,
of the Stockgrowers; and Alen Macona
chie, assistant cashier of the Livings
ton bank, for assisting George L. Carey,
the missing cashier, in his transactions
by which the bank was wrecked.
The report says: "Your grand jurors
believe they would be derelict in the
discharge of their duty to the court if
they failed to visit severe censure upon
the directors of these banks.
as
"The grand jurors are of the opinion
that the fact of being an officer or di
rector of a national bank ought not
to give any man licence to swindle and
defraud his fellow men. The national
bank directors owe a duty to the United
States, to the bank depositors and to
the business public. That duty is to
faithfully and honestly oversee and
manage the business of the bank of

in the observance.
It seems to be

directors of natioual banks,"
In conclusion the grand jury says;
"We deem it our duty as sworn officers
of the law in this manner to call the
attention of this honorable court to the
conduct of the said directors and to re
quest that this our public reprimand
and censure be spread upon the rocards
of this court.
The grand jury also
indicted Charles Jones, train robber,
for murder in the first degree while

as his accomplice in the murder.
Several other indictments for minor
offenses against United States laws
were found.
JONES ON FINANCIAL AFFAIRS.
Better Times Have Come Because the
People Decided to Make Them So.
Washington, Dec. 2. —Senator Jones
of Nevada, who has spent the greatest
part of his time since the adjournment
of the extra session in New York, has
returned to Washington, and says his
observation of financial affairs confirms
him in the opinion that was expressed
by himself and other silver advocates
prior to the passage of the bill repealing
the Sherman purchasing silver act,
that there will be no material revival
of business because of that action by
congress.
He finds some men, who have been
hoarding money since the panic began,
are showing a disposition to put it out
for giltedged securities, feeling that it
is better to have a small income from
capital than to keep it lying idle, but
that disposition is against taking risks,
and as a consequence there is little do
ing, looking to the extension of the
industrial interests of the country.
This he attributes to the small volume
of currency;to the fact that persons
with money will not make Investments
when prices are falling. Jones says he
does not expect to see any legislation
which will materially benefit silver
during the present administration.
Big; Well Under Control.
Huron, S. D., Dec. 4. —Experts have

recting the flow into ditches dug to
carry it into the river and preventing
further damage to hay and stacked
grain on the low lands in the vicinity
of the well. Crowds of people have
been attracted by the phenomenal out
burst of water. Representatives of the
Chicago Manufacturing company and
capitalists from Minneapolis and Wino
na are trying to get possession of the
well and if their negotiations prove
successful it will be used for power
purposes. _

Tacoma, Dec. 4. —When the Coupe

Institution. Beals was found here to
day. He had been going the pace that
