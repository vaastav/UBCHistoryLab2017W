derived from flrst-cUss matter, which pay9
three or four times more than its cost, and
Sroduclnp a larso annual loss to be paid
y general taxation. If such pecond-class
matter paid merely the cost of Us hand

surplus result, which misht bo used to
ITlvc the people still l etter mall facilities or
cheaper rates of letter postage. I recom
mend that better legislation be enacted at
once to correct there abuses and Introduce
better business ideas in the regulation of
our postal rate?.
Experiences and observations have dem
onstrated that certain Improvements in
the organization of the I'otofflce Depart
ment must be secured before we can gain
the full benefit of the immense sums ex
pended in its administration. This involves
the following reform, which I earnestly
recommend: TJire should b-e a small ad
dition to the existing inspector service, to
be employed In the supervision of the car
rier force, whih now numbers 13.CW0 men.
and performs its service practically with
out the surveillance exercised over all
other branches of the postal or public
service. Of course, such a lack of Fuper
vlsion and freedom from wholesale discip
linary restraints mu.U inevitably load to
Imperfect service. - There should afso be
appointed a few inspectors who would as
sist the central cftlce in necessary investi
gation concerning matters of postolllce
leases, potoffice fltes. allowance for rent,
fuel and lights, and in organizing and se
curing the best results from the work of
the ll.OOO clerks now employed in first and
second-clas. offices.
I am convinced the small expense at
tending the Inauguration cf the.e reforms
would actually be a protitable Investment.
I especially recommend such a recasting
of the appropriations by Congress for the
l'ostoffij Department as will permit the
work of consolidating postotfices. This
work has already been entered upon suf
llclently to fully demonstrate, by experi
ment and experience, that such consolida
tion U productive of better service, larper
revenues and les3 expenditures, to say
nothing of the further advantage of grad
ually withdrawing postofiices from the
spoils system.
The Universal Postal Union, which now
embraces all the civilized world, and
whoso delegates rriU represent l.OUO.OOO.oOO
people, will hold its fifth congress In the
city of ' Washington, in JIay. 1VJ7. The
United States may be said to have taken
the Initiative which led to the first meeting
of this ronreis. in Uerne. in IS. 4. and
the formation of the Universal- Postal
Union, which brings the postal service of
all countries to every man's neighborhood,
and has wrought marvels in cheaienlng
postal rates and securing absolutely safe
mail communication throughout the world.
Irevlous congresses have met In l?erne,
Lisbon and Vienna, and the respective
countries in which they have assembled
nave made generous -provision for their
accommodation and for the reception and
entertainment of the delegates.
In view of the importance of this assem
blage and of its deliberations, and cf the
honors and ho?pitalitles accorded to our
repreentaties by other countries on sim
ilar occasions. I earnestly hope that such
an appropriation will be made for the
expenses necessarily attendant upon the
coming meeting in our car'tal city, as will
be worthy of our national hospitality and
indicative of our appreciation of the event.
DEI'AHTMCXT OF JUSTICE.
Renewal of Recommendation for Ad
ditional Kcderul I'rlnon.
Tho attorney general presents a detailed
and Interesting statement of the important
work done under his supervision during the
last fiscal year. The ownership and man
agement by the government of peniten
tiaries for the confinement of those con
victed In United States Courts of violation
of federal laws, which for many years has
been a subject of executive recommenda
tion, has at last, to a slight extent, been
realized by tho utilization of the aban
doned military prison at Fort Leavenworth
a3 a United States penitentiary. This Is
certainly a movement In tho right direc
tion, but It ought to at once be supple
mented by the rebuilding or extensive en
largement of "this improvised prison, and
the construction of at least one more, to
be located In the Southern States. The
capacity of the Leavenworth prison Is so
limited that the expense- of its mainten
ance, calculited at a per capita, rate upon
the number cf prisoners it can accommo
date, does not make as economical exhibit
as It would If it were larger and better
adapted to prison purposes, but I am the
more thoroughly convinced that economy,
humanity and a proper sense of responsi
bility and duty toward .those whom we
punish for violation of federal law dictate
that the federal government should have
the entire control and management of the
penitentiaries where convicted violators
are confined.
It appears that since the transfer of the
Fort Leavenworth military prison to Its
new uses the work previously done by pris
oners confined there, and for which ex
pensive machinery has been provided, has
been discontinued. This work consisted of
tho manufacture of articles for army use,
now done elsewhere. On all grounds it is
exceeding desirable that the convicts con
lined in this penitentiary be allowed to re
sume work of this description.
It Is most gratifying to note the satis
factory results that havo followed the In
auguration of the new system provided for
by the act of May rS. 1Xk. under which cer
tain federal otlicials are compensated by
salaries Instead of fees. The new plan was
put In operation on the 1st day of July,
l&S. and already the great economy It en
forces, its prevention of abuses and Its
tendency to a better enforcement of the
laws, are strikingly apparent. Detailed
evidence of the usefulness of this long-delayed
but now happily-accomplished re
form will be found clearly set forth in the
attorney general's report.

Tha President reviews the work of ,the
Interior, Navy, War and Agriculture De
partments, full reports of which have been
printed in the Journal in. the past two or
three weeks. On the subject of ponslons
he says:
The diminution of our enormous pension
roll and the decrease of pension expenditure
which have been so 'often confidently fore
told still fall in material realization. The
number of pensioners on the rolls at the
closo of the fiscal year ended June 3u. 1SI6.
was 37o.(J7s. This was the largest numU-r
ever reported. The amount paid exclusive

amount will l necessary. The commis
sioner cf pensions reports that d in. it the

thes indictments lrT convictions resulted.
In my opinion, based uon such state
ments as theso and much other information
and observations, the abuses which have
been allowed to creep Into cur pension eys
tenl have done incalculable harm In de
moralizing our people and undermining
good citizenship. I have endeavored within
my sphere of official duty, to protect our
pension roil, and make it what it should

of those disabled In their country's sendee
and worthy of their country's affectionate
remembrance.
When I have seen those who pose as the
soldiers' friends active and alert in urging
greater laxity and more pension expendi
ture while nursing selfish schemes, I have
deprecated the approach of a situation,
when necessary retrenchment and enforced
economy may lead to an attack upon pen
sion abuses, so determined as to overlook
the discriminations due to those who.
worthy of care, ought to live and die under
' tho protection of a Nation's gratitude.
in closing his review of tho worK or tne
Department of Agriculture the President
says:
The large and Increasing exportation of
our agricultural products suggests the great
usefulness of the organization lately estab
lished In tho department, for the purpose of
giving to those engaged In farming pur
suits reliable information concerning the
condition, needs and advantages of different
foreign markets. Inasmuch as the success
of the farmer depends upon the sale of his
products, and inasmuch as foreign markets
must largely be th destination of such
products, it is quite apparent that a knowl
edge of the conditions and wants that affect
those markets ought to result in sowing
more Intelligently and reaping with a bet
ter promls? of profit. Such Information
points out the way to a prudent foresight
in the selection and cultivation of crops
and to a release from the bondage of un
reasoning monotony of production, a glutted
and depressed market and constantly re
curring unprofitable toll.
In my opinion, he gratuitous distribution
of seeds by the department as at present
conducted ought to be discontinued. No
one can read the statement of the secretary
cn this subject and doubt the extravagance
and questionable results of this practice.
The professed friends of the farmer, and
certainly the farmers themselves, are nat
urally expected to be willing to rid a de
partment devoted to the promotion of farm
ing interests of a feature which tends so
much to its discredit.
The weather bureau, now attached to the
Department of Agriculture, has continued
to extend its Fphere of usefulness, and by
an uninterrupted Improvement in the ac
curacy of its forecasts has greatly in
creased Its efficiency as an aid and protec
tion to all whose occupations are related
to weather conditions.
THE CIVIL-SKItVICE LAW.
Henefltn Derived from It Enforce
ment an Viewed by the President.
The progress mado In civil-service reform
furnishes a cause for the utmost congratu
lation. It has survived the doubts of its
friends, as well as the rancor of Its ene
mies, and has gained a permanent place
among the agencies destined to cleanse
our politics and to improve, economize and
elevate the public service.
There are now In the competitive classi
fied service upward of S4.0C0 places. More
than half of these have been Included,
from time to time, since March 4, 1S93.
A most radical and sweeping extension
was made by an executive order, dated
tho 6th day of May, 1S96. And if fourth
class postmasterships are not included in
tho statement, it may be said that prac
tically all positions contemplated by the
civil-service law are now class! Hed. Abun
dant reasons exist for Including these post
masterships, based upon economy, im
proved service and tho peace and quiet
of neighborhoods. If, however, obstacles
prevent such action at present I earnestly
hope that Congress will, without increas
ing postofflce appropriations, so adjust
them as to permit, in proper cases, a con
solidation of these postofllces, to the end
that through this process the result de
sired may, to a limited extent, be accom
plished. The civil-service regulations, as amended
during the last year, provide for a sensi
ble and uniform method of promotion,
basing eligibility to better positions upon
demonstrated ethciency and faithfulness.
The absence of fixed rules on this sub
ject has been an infirmity In the system
more and more apparent as its other bene
fits have been better appreciated.
The advantages of clvll-servlce methods
In their business aspects are too well un
derstood to rwijiro argument. Their ap
plication has become a necessity to the
executive work of the government. Hut
those who pain through the operation of
these methods should be made to under
stand that the nonpartisan scheme through
which they receive their appointments de
mands from them, by way of reciprocity,
nonpartisan and faithful performance of
duty under every administration and cheer
ful fidelity to every chief. While they
should be encouraged to decently exercise
their rights of citizenship and to support
through their suffrages the political beliefs
they honestly profess, the noisy, pestilent
and partisan employe who loves political
turmoil and contention, or who renders lax
and grudging service to an administration
r.ot representing his political views, should
be promptly and fearlessly dealt with in
such a way as to furnish a warning to
others who may be likewise disposed.
The annual report of the commissioners
will be duly transmitted, and I commend
the Important matter they have in charge
to the careful consideration of Congress.
I' TEIl STATE-CO MMERCE LAW.
Concremi freed to Consider the Com
mlnalon'a Amendment.
The Interstate-commerce Commission
has, during the last year, supplied a grand
evldenco of Its usefulness and the Impor
tance of the work committed to Its charge.
Public transportation is a universal neces
sity, and the question of just and reason
able charges therefor has become of vital
Importance not only to shippers and car
riers, but also to tho vast multitude of pro
ducers and consumers
The justness and equity of the principles
embodied In the existing law passed for
the purpose of regulating these charges are
everywhere conceded, and there appears to
be no question that the policy thus entered
upon has a permanent place in our legisla
tion. As the present statute, when enacted,
was. In the nature of tho case, more or less
tentative and experimental, it was hardly
expected to supply a complete and edequate
system. While its wholesome effects are
manifest and have ably Justified its en
actment. It is evident that all desired re
forms In transportation methods have not
been fully accomplished.
In view of the Judicial interpretation
which some provisions of this statute have
received and the defects disclosed by the
efforts made for its enforcement, its re
vision and amendment appear to be essen
tial, to the end that It may more effectually
reach the evils designed to be corrected. I
hope the recommmendat'.cn of tho commis
sion upon this subject will be promptly and
favorable considered by tho Congress.
In concluding this communication its last
words shall be vn appeal to the Congress
for the most rigid economy in the expendi
ture of the money it holds In trust for the
people. The way to perplexing extrava
gance is easy, but a return to frugality is
difficult. When, however. It Is considered
that those who bear the burdens of taxa
tion have no guarantee of honest care save
In the fidelity of their public servants, the
duty of all possible retrenchment is plainly
manifest.
When our differences are forgotten and
our contests of political opinion are no
longer remembered, nothing in the retro
spect of our public service will be as for
tunnt and comforting as the recollection
of clllclal duty well performed, and the
memory of a constant devotion to the in
terests of our conltding fellow-countrym-n.

Conditions Such, the Secretary Saya,
This Government Mny Be Forced
to Change Ita Policy.
WASHINGTON, Dec. 7. For the first
time within memory of old officials, the
secretary of state has made a regular re
port to the President for transmission to
Congress, like the reports of other officers
of the Cabinet. This report was laid before
Congress to-day as an appendix to the Pres
ident's message. It treats of many de
tails of our relations during the past year
with foreign governments, that either were
not touched upon at all In the message or
were more briefly treated.
Under the head of Spain secretary Olney
has much to say in reference to Cuba, and
In his report he sets out in great detail
the history of the growth of the rebellion,
the present evil state of affairs on the
island and other facts upon which the
President bases his broad statements and
conclusions. Reference is made to a report
from Consul General Lee, but the secre
tary intimates that his Information comes
principally from the United States consuls,
and so must b regarded as confidential
as to its source.
Tne secretary's estimate of the present
situation Is disclosed In the following para
graph, made after a preliminary statement
of the destruction of the industrial re
sources of Cuba: "From whatever point of
view we regard the matter, It Is Impossible
not to discern that a state of things exists
at our doors alike dangerous to good re
lations, destructive of legitimate com
merce, fatal to the internal resources of
Cuba and most vexatious and trying, be
cause entailing upon the government ex
cessive burdens in its domestic administra
tion and in Its outward relations. This sit
uation cannot indefinitely continue with
out growing still worse, and that time may
not be far distant when the United States
must seriously consider whether Its rights
and interests as well as Its international
duties in view of Its peculiar relations to
the island do not call for some decided
change in the policy hitherto pursued."
A FORMIDABLE UPRISING.
To begin with, the secretary makes it
plain that tho present insurrection Is far
more formidable than the famous "ten
year Insurrection," which began at Yara in
1S6S. He says that starting in the same
portion of the Island it very early took
proportions beyond Its predecessor and
therewith assumed an aggressive phase.
Passing the defensive lines or tiochas tra
versing the island from north to south,
formidable bodies of the revolutionary
forces early in the year established them
selves in the rich sugar-planting districts
of Santa Clara, Cienfuegos and Matan
zas. made hostile forays almost in sight of
Havana itself and, advancing westward,
effected a lodgment In the fertile tobacco
fields of Plnar del Rio, which has so far
resisted all efforts of the Spanish forces
to overcome It. The secretary says that
while no prominent seaport has been at
tacked by the insurgents, a large part of
the 2,100 miles of seacoast Is practically in
their hands, and from its rugged and wild
character is peculiarly fitted for guerrilla
warfare, and affords easy means of receiv
ing clandestine supplies cf men and arms.
The secretary adds:
"While thus, in fact, controlling the
larger part of the internal area of the
whole Island of Cuba, from Cape San An
tonio to Cape Maisl, and enjoying prac
tically unlimited use of an equally large
part of the coast, the revolutionary forces
are scattered, being nowhere united for
any length of time, to form an army ca
pable of attack and fit to take the defen
sive in a pitched battle. Assembling sud
denly at a given point, often In a single
night, they make unexpected sallies or
carry destruction to the tobitcco and cane
fields of Cuba, and at the first sign of pur
suit or organized assault they disperse,
only to reassemble in like manner at some
other spot."
As bearing upon the question of recogni
tion of the Insurgents, probably soon to
come before Congress In some shape, the
following statement by Secretary Olney Is
of importance as explaining his reasons for
declining recognition:
"So far as our Information shows, there
Is not only no effective local government
by the insurgents In the territories they
overrun, but there is not even a tangible
pretense to established administration any
where. Their organization, confined to the
shifting exigencies of military operations
of tho hour. Is nomadic, without definite
centers and lacking the most elementary
features of municipal government. There
nowhere appears to be nucleus of state
hood. Machinery for exercising the legiti
mate rights and powers of sovereignity and
responding to the obligation, which de facto
sovereignty entails in the face of equal
rights of other States Is conspicuously
lacking. It is not possible to discern a
homogenous political entity, possessing and
exercising the functions of administration,
and capable. If left to Itself, of maintaining
orderly government In its own territory and
sustaining normal relations with the ex
ternal family ot governments."
. ACT OF ANARCHY.
The secretary illustrates his point as to
the irresponsibility of the Insurgents by
citing their destruction of American planta
tions and oppression of American planters
who grind cane, which he characterizes as
acts of anarchy. On the other hand he
shows that in the capital cities and sea
ports and all parts of the Island with which
the United States or its citizens maintain
legitimate normal Intercourse the Spanish
power is supreme, though often exercised
in a vexatious and arbitrary way calling for
Just remonstrance, and most of the func
tions of government proceed as In time of
peace. Recurring to his comiarison of this
insurrection with those that have preceded
it Secretary Olney makes this significant
statement: "From every accessible Indica
tion it is clear that the present rebellion
Is on a far more formidable scale as to num
bers, intelligence and representative fea
tures than any of the preceding revolts of
this century: that the corresponding effort
of Spain for its repression has been enor
mously augmented; and that, despite the
constant Influx of. fresh armies and ma
terial of war from the metropolis, the re
bellion after nearly two years of successful
resistance, appears to-day to be In a con
dition to indefinitely prolong the contest on
Its present lines." He also compliments
the tactlcr.l skill displayed by the leaders
of the insurrection, saying thnt when the
disparity of numbers and the comparatively
indefensive character of the central and
western Vega country are considered, the
passage of a considerable force Into Plnar
del Rio. followed by its successful main
tenance there for many months must be
regarded as a military success of a pro
nounced character.
"The Insurgent armies," said the secre
tary, "fairly represents th Intelligent as
pirations of a large proportion of the peo
ple of the whole Island; fcnd it is shown
that they purpose to wageJthis contest, on
these better grounds of vantage, to the
end. and to make the present struggle a su
preme test of the capacity of the Cuban
people to win for themselves and their chil
dren the heritage of self-government.'
The secretary speaks of the appalling
phases of the struggle, such as often ap
pear in contests among the Latin races of
the western hemisphere: of the excesses
and forceful and arbitrary acts of the
military, of the ravaging of private prop
erty, the violation of principles of civilized
warfare by irresponsible officials, and the
killing of noncombatants In some In
stances, happily few, of American citizens.
He says: "A large part of the correspond
ence of the State Department with Its
agents in Cuba has been devoted to these
cases of assault upon the rights of our
citizens. In no Instances has the earnest
remonstrance and energetic appeal been
omitted. But th representatives of the
Spanish power often find It easily prac
ticable to postpone explanations and
reparation cn the ground of alleged ignor
ance of facts or for other plausible, rea
sons." Tiir secretary next treats at length of the
financial and industrial losses Inflicted upon
American citizens by the continuance of
the strife, all of which is summed up con
cisely by the President In a portion of his
message. That part of the report devoted
to Cuba concludes with a brief statement
of the "Competitor" case which, it appears,
has now been remanded by the Madrid au
thorities for retrial, and a statement of tho
dissent of the State Department from the
requirement of the governor general of
Cuba that all aliens In Cuba shall be regis
tered within a certain time under pain of
disbarment from the protection of law.
THE VENEZUELAN DISPUTE.
Secretary Olney says very ll.tle more than
does tho President in his message respect
ing the Venezuelan boundary question. He
announces with gratification that amicable
counsels have prevailed to induce a satis
factory result of the attempts at an under
standing, and that the boundary question
and its associated phases have been at last
eliminated as between this country and
England. He gives, however, no inkling of
the nature of the treaty beyond the state
ment that it provides for honorable arbitra
tion of the whole controversy. In view of
the suspicion that has arisen In some quar
ters that the arrangement has not proven
entirely acceptable to Venezuela, It Is a
significant statement of Secretary Olney
that "no coubt is entertained that Vene
zuela, which has so earnestly sought tne
friendly ut-E'stance of the United States to
ward tha settlement of this vexatious con
tention and wh.ch has so unreservedly con
fided her interests to the impartial Judg
ment of this government, will assent to the
formal r.a-urtment thus attained, thus for
ever ending a dispute involving far-reach
ing const qvrnccs to the peace and welfare
of the western continent."
Tom-I ing the negotiations for a general
atbitration treaty for the settlement of all
future disputes between the United States
and Great Urltain, Secretary Olney sas
that both countries, having given repeated
proofs of tllr acquiescence In the great
principle involved, n-t only by treaties be
tween tren seves, but severally by conclud
ing liko adjustments with other powers lor
the adjudication of disputes resting on law
and fact, the subject was naturally ap
proached in a benevolent spirit of agiee
mcn and the negotiations have so satis
factory progressed as to foreshadow a
practical upreement at an early date upon
the text of a convention to the desired end.
The setietary expresses the regret that
the British government has refused its con
currence ;n a proposed International com
mission to devise means of protecting the
seal herds: recites the findings of the ex
perts, in effect showing that the herd Is
threatened with total destruction unless
changes are made speedily in the award
regulations, and hopes that the experts'
report will Induce the British government
to agree upon these changes.
The report shows that negotiations are in
progress for a convention to locate imme
diately that part of the Alaskan boundary
line along the one hundred and forty-flrst
meridian by monuments and Joint survey,
while the prospects for tho precise demark
atlon of tho coast-line boundary are said
to bo good, a preliminary survey having
been completed and negotiations based on
It about to be undertaken.
It Is announced that tho assent of Great
Britain and other maritime states having
been secured the new rules for the preven
tion of collisions at sea will go into effect
July 1 next.
Under the head of Germany, the report
treats briefly of the exclusion from that
country of American meat products. The
situation apparently remains unchanged,
and there has been no amelioration of the
stringent measures adopted by Germany,
"on assumed grounds of public health,"
against our cattle. "On the contrary."
says the secretary, "the disposition of Ger
many, visible for a number of years past,
to still further Impede and virtually Inhibit
this legitimate traffic, is evidenced by
fresh restrictive measures, national and lo
cal. Their unjustlfiability and the erron
eousness of the supposed premises on
which they rest have been again pointed
out. and the healthfulness of our exports
supported by amply conclusive proof." The
secretary says there are fair prospects of
the ultimate removal of the Interdiction
upon American life-insurance companies
seeking to do business In Germany. The
subject of the relmpositlon of tonnage dues
on German vessels is discussed compactly
to show that the law was mandatory upon
the President to Issue his proclamation as
soon as the facts were established.
Hawaii comes In for a single short para
graph in the report, stating that no ques
tions of Importance have arisen, that a few
claims for indemnity, have been filed in be
half of United States citizens arrested dur
ing the last rebellion, and that the final
chapter In the history of that attempted
revolt was reached In the pardon of the ex
Queen. Samoa is also briefly treated, the situa
tion being unchanged, and the United
States necessarily continuing to exercise
all stipulated rights and duties under the
tripartite general act of Berlin "during the
continuance of the compact, however irk
some and unnatural these rights and duties
may prove to be." It is intimated that the
United States will appoint a successor to
Chief Justice Ide, who resigned.
AMERICANIZED JEWS IN RUSSIA.
An explanation of the difficulties that
arise in connection with the effort to pro
tect United States naturalized citizens,
usually Jews who return to Russia, is af
forded by the following paragraph: "Hold
ing to the old doctrine of perpetual alle
giance, refusing to lessen its authority by
concluding any treaty recognizing tho nat
uralization of a Russian subject without
prior Imperial consent, asserting the ex
treme right to punish a naturalized Rus
sian on return to his native jurisdiction,
not merely for. unauthorized emigration,
but also specifically for the unpermitted
acquisition of a foreign citizenship, and
sedulously applying, at home and through
the official acts of its agents abroad, to all
persons of the Jewish belief the stern re
strictions enjoined by Russian law, tho
government of Russia takes ground not
admitting of acquiescence by the United
States, because at variance with the char
acter of our institutions, the sentiments of
our people, the provisions of our statutes
end the tendencies of modern International
comity." Nevertheless, the secretary says,
the differences that arise are composed in
worthy cases by the friendly disposition of
Russia toward our country and people.
Other points in the report may be briefly
summarized as follows: The Argentine
government has settled the Hale claim by
offering to ray an indemnity. Arrests of
naturalized Americans returning to Austria
are becoming less frequent. Efforts con
tinue for the removal of restrictions on the
Importation of American cattle into Bel
glum. There are prospects of a speedy con
clusion of arrangements for the completion
of the work left unfinished by the Chilean
claims commission of 1S94. The Chinese
government has settled all claims of Amer
icans for losses through the antl-forelgn
riots, and it is expected that that govern
ment will soon consent to a' formal recog
nition of the right of American missionaries
and teachers to full protection in their work
and property. The claim of Julio Santos
against Ecuador, standing for a quarter
of a century, has been settled directly be
tween the parties on the eve of arbitration.
The French government has promised the
fullest etxension to American citizens and
Interests in Madagascar of all rights under
present treaties between France and the
Wnited States, so our consuls in Madagas
car are relinquishing extraterritorial juris
diction. It Is suggested that our minister
resident at Haiti and San Domingo be
raised to the grade of plenipotentiary. The
Italian government Is stopped from claim
ing Indemnity for the Italians killed at
Hahnvllle. La., last June, by reason of the
fact that they had voted In State elections,
and so abandoned their Italian citizenship.
An extension for one year of the functions
of tho Mexican boundary commission In or
der to allow it to pass upon important
Issues of irrigation and storage dams on the
Rio Grande river, is noted. The Peruvian
government has settled the claim of certain
American citizens employed on a hydo
granhie commission by the payment of
20.CC0 soles. A naturalization treaty Is to be
negotiated with Switzerland which has so
far refused to admit th right of expatria
tion to its citizens. Extradition treaties
have been concluded with Argentine and
the Orange Free State, and will be sub
mitted to the Senate. Estimates have ben
collected of the cost of acquiring suitable
buildings for the permanent oecupancy of
ea'-h of our embassies and legations abroad:
pnd a more commodious building specially
designed for the nteds of the State Depart
ment Is recommended.
ACCEPTED RV VENEZUELA.

proved by the Cnracnn Government.
WASHINGTON. Dec. 7,Secretary Olney
to-day received a cablegram - from Senor

ing that the Venezuelan government has
accepted the agreement reached by the
United States an)d Great Britain for the ar
bitration of the boundary dispute and that

State Department this evening embraces ail
of the Information In the possession of the
department respecting the treatment by
Venezuela of the proposed arbitration
treaty: "Secretary Olney received this
morning a telegram from Minister Andrade
at Caracas to the effect, in substance, that

Great Britain and the United States for
the settlement of the Venezuelan boundary
question is accepted by the Venezuelan
government: that the memorandum will
be published at Caracas this afternoon,

zuelan Congress will be called as soon as
possible in order that the memorandum
may be carried into effect by the neces
sary treaty between Great Britain and
Venezuela."
The department has also made public the
text of the heads of the proposed treaty,
as they were agreed upon between Great
Britain and the United States, showing
that the advance publication was perfectly
accurate.
MASSACRE OF NEGROES
FIVE SHOT DOWN IN COLD BLOOD IN
THE "WILDS OF ARKANSAS.
Jesse Winner nnd James Nelson
Lynched In Missouri for Killing a
Woman and Two Babes.
MALVERN, Ark., Dec. 7. What may be
regarded as reliable information has Just
reached here that on last Tuesday after
noon at a point abojit midway between
Camden and Bearden, on the line of the
Cotton-belt railroad, five negroes were mas
sacred. At the place mentioned a gang of
section men, composed principally of ne
groes with a white foreman, were engaged
in their labor of improving tho road bed,
when unknown persons made their appear
ance on the scene and, without warning,
began immediately to fire into the crowd
of helpless and unsuspecting negroes, which
resulted in the death of five of them. The
foreman says he did not recognize any of
the assassins. Many believe that he knows
who they are, but on account of the proba
bility of personal danger he failed to give
any information that would lead to their
arrest. The section where the last murders
occurred is occupied almost entirely by
sawmills and is filled with lawless charac
ters. The sheriff of Ouachita is exerting
himself In every way possible to apprehend
the guilty ones, and the Cotton-belt Itail
road Company has offered a reward of $250
for the capture of the murderers. If they
are captured it is believed the courts will
mete out swift Justice to them.
LITTLE ROCK, Ark., Dec. 7. Governor
Clarke was. this afternoon, asked if he had
received any information concerning the re
ported massacre of five negroes on the
Cotton Belt road between Bearden and
Camden on last Tuesday, and replied that
he had heard nothing of such an occur
rence. He discredited the report, saying
that the sheriff would undoubtedly have
notified him had any such terrible crime
been committed. It was not likely, the
Governor thought, that such a crime could
have been committed last Tuesday and the
news be suppresed until the present time.
Double Lynching?.
LEXINGTON, Mo., Dec. 7. At about 1
o'clock this morning a mob of Ray county
farmers broke into the county jail here and
secured Jesse Winner and James Nelson,
held for the murder of Mrs. Winner and
her two babes, and lynched them. The mob
broke Into the Jail with little difficulty and
speedily accomplished their object of met
ing out punishment to the alleged butchers.
The j-ill was not heavily guarded, as no
warning had been sent by the authorities at
Richmond to prepare for a mob. The mob
was composed of 150 men, all unmasked.
The crime for which Winner and Nelson
were lynched was the murder of Mrs. Win
ner, wife of the lynched man, and of Clara
Winner, aged three years, and Perle Win
ner, a boy aged eighteen months. The
Winners lived northeast of Richmond. On
Oct. 16 Winner left home for a day or so,
and the next day Mrs. Winner and the two
children were found with their throats cut.
Mrs. Winner's body lay just outside the
house, and was frightfully mutilated by
hogs before it was discovered. The Win
ner came to Ray county about five years
ago, coming from Tipton, Paulding county,
Ohio, where his wife resided. Both were
well connected, she having two brothers
back In Ohio who are considered very
wealthy.

Proposed Memoriul to a, Brewer.
KANSAS CITY. Mo.. Dec. 7. Mrs. Helen
Dickerson Harford, of Oregon, national or
ganizer of the W. C. T. U., has created a
sensation while filling the pulpit of the
Dundee Methodist Episcopal Church in this
city by denouncing in unmeasured terms
the acceptance by the city of a memorial,
to be erected in tho center of the city, to
the memory of Ferd Helm, the brewer,
lately deceased. The Helm brothers, who
succeded their brother in business, haa
drawn plans for an imposing structure to
be erected t the deceased's memory, and
successfully tendered It to the city officials.
In tho course of her sermon Mrs. Harford
arraigned the city fathers for their action,
alluding to the memorial as a f monument
of Infamy," and appealed to her congrega
tion to prevent its erection.

A PEOPLE OF FEW WORDS
"Let your speech be yea, yea, and nay,
nay," says the Good Book, "for whosoever
is more than these cometh of evil." The
Shakers abide by the spirit of this rule.
Their words are few, simple, sincere and
direct. They waste no energy in idle talk;
they use it in thinking and doing. And
whatever they do they do with their might.
They are content with nothing short of the
essence and principle of the things they
investigate. They take pains and are
patient. And thus the doors of many
strange truths open to them. In this way
they discovered what may almost be called
the unity of disease. A venerable Shaker
says cf it: "It is said that one man's meat
is another man's poison. That is but half
the truth. Any man's meat is any man's
poison, under certain conditions. If the
grain never got further than the hopper
we would never have bread; and if bread
never got further than the stomach we
should never have strength. When' the
stomach is torpid, helpless and inflamed
the food lies in it and rots. This fermen
tation produces poisons which may, and
often do, disorder every other organ and
function of the body. This is indigestion
or dyspepsia, with many symptoms and
disguises. Cure it and you cure nine
tenths of your complaints." "lhese words
were uttered many years ago. Since then
they have found a remedy, now known as
the Shaker Digestive Cordial. It is made
from medicinal plants cultivated by them.
It Is a food and digests other foods. Taken
while eating It rtsts the stomach and
nourishes the system. The pain and dis
tresses of dyspepsia disappear before it.
It prevents fermentation and soon restores
full power to the digestion. It succeeds In
the worst cases. It is worthy the name of
the people whose name It boars. Any drug
gist will sell you a trial bottle for ten cents.
