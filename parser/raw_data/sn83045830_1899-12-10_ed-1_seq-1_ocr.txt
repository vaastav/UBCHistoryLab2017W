GERHAKt'S BOKE1GN POLICY.
To be Fully Prof en led In the Klchttag
5rit Tuesday.
iSpecial Berlin Cable Letter. Copy?
right ISfly, The Associated Press.)
HERREN", Dec, 0.?Next Tuesday will
be a groat day in the Reichstag. The
budget debate will open and Count
Von Buelow will make a full presenta?
tion of the present status of Ge'rmany's
foreign policy. Ho will deal particu?
larly on Samoa and the Transvaal and
will frankly acknowledge the high val?
ue lie attaches to the fully established
cordial understanding -between Ger?
many, the United States and Croat
Britain. He will also show the abso?
lute need of a powerful navy. The
Reichstag will give Count Von Buelow
nattering evidence of its confidence.
The ensuing debate will bo most inter?
esting.
Information which is considered con?
clusive, shows that the abolition of the
anti-coalition paragraph of the political
associations has produced a serious
rupture between the Emperor and the
government and. the Right and Conser?
vative parties, who now acknowledge
they wore foiled in an attempt to oust
Prince Hohonloe.
DR. MIQUEL IN DISGRACE.
Another interesting result is that Dr.
Minnel, who. until a few months ago.
wielded a great influence within the
cainet, over tihe Emperor, is now defi?
nitely disgraced, to the extent that the
Emperor declines to confer personally
with him.
It is probably not too much to say
that President McK'inley's message
will have a lasting effect in cementing
American-German friendship. A pro?
nounced cordial and amicable tone to?
ward the United States has become
general in the German press. Count
Buelow's frank Avoids to the Associated
Press (have been since supplemented
by similar utterances which he has
made to several German papers, the
most remarkable being in the Neufste
Nachrichten in Fredeiick the Great,
dwelt on blood affinity and reciprocity
of culture, spoke in praise of the Unit?
ed States' attitude in settling the Sa?
moa trouble, in permitting cable lay?
ing, and in the conclusion -of a part eis
post treaty. congratulated the two
countries on the removal of the friction
growing out of the trouble with the
insuianco companies and expressed the
hope that the remaining commercial
differences -would be settled through
mutual good will.

THE PAPERS AKti SIGNED.
W.S.Taylor Is Formerly D?clar<d Gortr
nor-El?ct of Kentucky.
(By Telegraph.)
FRANKFOKT. KY., Dec. 9.?At S:45
this morning the election certificate of
\Vm. ?. Taylor was signed by the elec?
tion commissioners and he was declared
to be governor-elect of Kentucky. The
official figures of the vote filed with
Secretary of State Finlay are:
Taylor. 193,714: Goebel, 191.331. Tay?
lor's plurality, 2.3S3.
The operation, which ended for the
time being, at least, the bitterly fought
gubernatorial contest, was conducted in
the simplest manner. The majority
opinion of commissioners Pryor and
Ellis and the minority opinion of Com?
missioner Poyntz, which was publish?
ed this morning, were not read, as was
the original Intention. The three com?
missioners walked first to the office of
ib.- clerk of th" State Supreme Court,
v. here they tiled two opinions.
Q t" 1 T E < ;0M MOS PEAC E.
They then passed into the office of
the secretary of state, clerk ChenauH
of tlie hoard of commissioners, read the
rigures showing that the Republican
candidates for ihe dices on the state
ticket had received the largest number
of votes and then certificates of elec?
tion v.ere signed at once, that of Mr.
Taylor being first on the list.
There were only fourteen persons in
the room at the time and of this num?
ber only two were then as spectators.
There was ho or.ivvd a.iound the build
in-,' and no interest was manifested in
tlie work save those engaged in it. The
three commissioners were all apparent?
ly in good humor, although Commis?
sioners Ellis and Pryor, who had done
tin- most work in preparing their long
and elaborate opinion, looked worn and
tired. The certificates as soon as sign
e ! were ti!"d with the secretary of st ite
and e.'.mmissens will be issued to the
t ie- ted men at once by Governor Brad
.M R. C.i IEP.E-1. LAUGHED.
Mr. Goebel was apparently in the
in-: of humor after being told that
Mr. Taylor's certificate had been sign?
ed. He laughed and shook his head
when asked if he had anything to say.
"Not a tiling: 1 am not talking."
"When will you make a conies;'?"
?'] have not decided yet. and I. of
e.uvrse. cannot discuss when l do not
know it myself."
The defeated candidate was game to
the last and if there was any ill-humor
in him nobody knew it but himself. Mr.
Taylor was modest and reticent, as
.:. u:i I.
"I expected it. of course," he-said.
"T knew that if t'he commissioners went
by .he iaw and the evidence they could
<.: < i: thing else than decide the way
they have done."
Commissioner Poyntz declined to sign
the Republican certificates of election,
saying that he stood (by the opinion he
had rendered and could not consistent?
ly do so. He consented to sign the i er
tifteates of the Railroad commissioners,
however.
TISSUE HAiLLOTS TLUBGAL.
?FRAlNKiFOR'T. KY., December 9.?
At to-day's session, of the Court of Ap?
peals the tissue ballot, ease from Ohio
county was decided and was eon cure: d
in by four of the seven judges. Tlie
'court held that all ballots ?houlld) be
printed on white paper, sufficiently
thick that the printing cannot be dis?
tinguished from the back and if bal?
lots are used at an election, which do
not substantially comply wich the law,
the election Is not "conducted as requir
?.3 'by law and is invalid.
The opinion of the court is too late
to affect the decision of the State elec?
tion commission, but sets a precedent
for the 'State Contest Board.
INAUGURATION' XEXT.
The scenes at the capitol shifted to?
day interest over the contests for State
offices ending with the delivery of the
certificates of election. To-night the
arrangements for Taylor's inauguration
Tuesday overshadows everything else.
Goebel left for his home at Covihgton
at 4 o'clock anid- nearly all elf the Demo?
crats left on to-night's trains. Mr. Goe?
bel was aeompaniod to the train by
Senator Blackburn and others. He said
that the -question whether he and his
associates on the defeated ticket would
contest was: still urtdecide:.i though
'Blackburn later maintained that the
question was settled affirmatively.
Former 'Senator .Blackburn as chair?
man of the Goebel State Campaign
iComimittee issued a call to-night for a
meeting of the committee next Thurs?
day. December 14th.
Chairman A. \V. Young also issued a
;'all for a meeting of the State Centrai
anil' State Executive Cominfiittees here
on the same day. Tiiis call does no;
state in either case what the Object of
the. conference is. but it is known that
the 'Purpose is to give official party en.
darsement to contests which shall be
made by Goebel and the candidates on
the defeated (Democratic ticket. Goebel
aid -Blackburn received many- telegrams
from Democrats over the State urging
contests and it is said mass meetings
will be held in various bounties next
week (for the purpose of -working up
sentiment on the subject.
SIOB A1TES ACID TBIIOWKit.
Barber Who Illtodfrt Ills Landlady Taken
to Atlams for Safety.
(By Telegraph.')
MACON. OA.. Dec. 9.?Major A.
Smith, a white barber, was taken from
here today to Atlanta to avoid lynching.
The offense which so aroused the com?
munity against Smith was the throwing
of acid into Ihe face of Mrs. S. M. Hil
lard. his landlady, and blinding her.
Smith came to Macon from Mississippi
several months ago and with his wife
boarded with Mrs. Billard. About a
week ago he was notified he must pay
up or quit. His wife was permitted to
remain. Since then he has visited his
wife several times -and abused and
threatened her. This morning he went
to the house and asked to see his wife.
Mrs. Hillaid informed him that the wo?
man did not wish to see him because
she was afraid of -him. Without pro?
vocation he took a bottle of acid from
his pocket and dashed the contents in?
to Mrs. Hillard's face. He was arrest?
ed and lodged in 'the police barracks.
So intense was the feeling against him
?that the authorities deemed it best to
send him to Atlanta, which was done.

'New and interesting matters engross?
ed: the attention of the lawmakers in
tooth brandies of the legislature
to-day.
There is no prospect of -.t bill being
passed to lease the Virginia oyster beds
to foreign people. The oldmembers of
the legislature, as a rule., and most ol
the new ones, who have- become ac?
quainted -with the subject, are well
pleased with the report mlaU'e by .In?
state Board 0.' Fisheries. The act
passed creating this commission, will
be'amended in some of the minor parti?
culars, but no material changes will be
made.
.ST ATI-: Sirru'EYOR..
It is probable that provision will be
made for a .State Surveyor of Oyster
Grounds. Chairman Mathews. of the
H'ouse Committee on Chesapeake and
its Trihutiiries. is heartily in favor of
tile creation of this oflice. Be thinks
it. very essential for the grounds to be
surveyi .1 and plats made. Mr. Ma?
thews thinks that t'ne revenues from
the oyster industry during the next
fiscal year will be double that of the
last, provided the commission is per?
mittee to carry on ihe work already
mapped out.
Delegate I-;. ,-. Koikes is making a
big tight to prevent tin- merging, of tin'
position of 'Register of tin- Rand Office
with that of thi- Secretary of the Oom

'Mr. Felkes is fully convinced that
there- will be no saving to tile State by
the proposed change. He said to-day
he was convinced that many other
-.lien.hers e.f the legislature were begin?
ning to see the matter in the same
light. Mr. Felkes is positive now that
the oflice will not be abolished.
IN THE IT'PK'lt HOUSE.
Senator 'Barkesdale introduced a' bill
to make telegraph companies common
carriers in this commonwealth. He
wUnted it referred to the Committee on
General Laws, of which Senator Sands
is chairman.
Senator Maynard. chairman of the
Roads 'Committee, -said he though the
?measure should go to the body over
w hich he presides.
President pro tern Wickham, who was
in the chair, ruled that the Roads
Committee was the proper body to con?
sider this bill art! it was so referred.
Senator'Foster presented a bill to al?
low the Norfolk and Southern Railroad
j'Company to consolidate with other
I roads. The object of this measure is
to allow this road to consolidate with
the. Virginia Beach roa'd.
T'ANTATION OF lyRIA NCH.'IS'E.
Senator Barksdale further presented
a bill " to detine and declare what
shall constitute a telephone, telegraph
and express company, to provide a
method tor the determination of tlie
vialue of that property within this state
for the purpose of taxation, and' to
make it penal for the companies or
their agents to refuse to furnish the
information by the terms otf this act."
This is practically the same bill that
was intieduced and passed in the
House by Mr. Saunders last season, it
provides for the taxing of telegraph
and telephone companies in the United
States.
A BATTLESHIP.
?A Joint resolution came ever from the
! House requestine- the delegation in Con?
gress to urge the President to "name
the next first-class battleship ahat is
appropriated for. Virginia, in honor of
our -beloved State, the mother of States
and statt .-.men."
?Mr. INcrwberne was the author of the
resolut ie>n.
Senator Barksdale objected to the
resolution, because, he said, he wanted
mi ship named Virginia which Mc?
Kinley might send to conquer a peo?
ple struggling for liberty.
Senator Foster eloquently a&voeated
tlie passage of the resolution.
Senator vWkbam declared that no
politics 'was in the question, and in an
impassioned and eloquent si>eeeh urged
the adoption. .He referred to the sliip
-building in Virginia, and', the rebuild
in" of the Kear.-.arge and Alabama:and
paid a glowing tribute to the State
and memories that linger about it.
Senator Barksdale came up smiling
again, and with enthusiasm, denounced
imperialism, ami said he thought it
would be construed as an indorsement

appeared as "Aguinaldo" running for
safety and pursued by three members
of 'the club representing Generals Law

uldo" was captured by these three "olti
eers" and then "General Otis" another
member of the club, stalked in military
pomp and after some conversation re?
ceived the reports of the officers, each

claiming to have captured the Filipino
chief. Aiftter reading each report, he
dictated a dispatch to his "orderly"'

the "army under my command presents
the nation, as a Christmas g'if't. with
Agu'iinaldo." The club took, in the can?

Roberts Hears Charges Made
Against Him in Committee,
OFFERS PLEA OF NOT GUILTY
Be Deuiuri to the Jurisdiction of the Im
vestlgatlng Body. Delegation of Gen?
tiles from Utah Present at the
Pobllc Hearing of Case.
(By Telegraph.)
WASHINGTON, Doe. 9.?The consid?
eration of the case of Mr. Roberts was
resumed at 10 o'clock this morning by
the investigating committee. Mr. Rob?
erts being present to plead his own
case. The proceedings continued to be
behind closed doors. 'Mr. Roberts was
first asked if he conceded the existence
of the court record wherein he plead?
ed guilty in 1S99 under the Edmunds
Tucker law. This he conceded. He
was next asked whether, about 1SS9 or
since 1890, he had married plural wives
and had lived in polygamous relations
in violation -of law.
PLKADS NOT GUILTY.
To tin- whole of this charge Roberts
pleaded not guilty and then demurred
to tlii- jurisdiction of the eomlmittee for
the following reasons:
First, on the gmund of the violation
of tin constitutional rights in that it
attempted to try him for a crime with?
out presentment of indictment by grand
jury and without trial before a jury
and due process of law.
Second, that it was an attempt to de?
in ivo him of his vested property and
that n.- held in the emoluments of an
office for the full term.
Third, that the only evidence that
could In- right fully considered was a
com t record and establishing the
guilt, confessed or proven, of the rep?
resentative-elect and Uhat the commit?
tee mis no right to consider any other
evidence.
Fourth, that the crime alleged, name?
ly, that of unlawful cohabitation, even
if proven, -would not constitute a suf?
ficient crime to bar a memiber or de?
prive him of his seat, because inno?
cence of polygamy or unlawful cohalb
Ltation is nowhere enumerated in the
constitution as a qualification for of?
fice of member of Congress, nor is it
named in any United States law ap?
plicable to Utah or any other state.
URGES PRIM A FACIE RIGHT.
Mr. Roberts concluded by asking that
his prima facie right to a seat be at
once considered as the present status
den!? s to a. sovereign state representa?
tion in the House at a time when inju?
rious legislation affecting that state
mij;lit take place.
The first of the public hearings in the
case began at 2 o'clock. At that ihour
the committee room was crowded "with
members, representatives of the press
and a delegation representing the Gen?
tile element of Utah. Mr. Roberts sat
at the foot of the long committee table
with documents piled up before him.
His secretary was near at hand, ibring
Ing him lxK>ks and other data of refer?
ence. Chairman T'ayler announced that
persons who had participated im fram?
ing the charges were present and asked
that they be heard.
Mr. A. T. Sehroeder, one of the Gen?
tile delegation from Utah, said it could
be established that Mr. Roberts had
maintained and is now maintaining the
status of a polygamlst; that .in 1889 he
pleaded guilty of unlawful 'cohabita?
tion and had since that time continued
in that relation.
CHARGES CAN BE PROVEN.
Specifically, Mr. Sehroeder said it
could be established that there had
recently been born children to his po?
lygamous wives, among them -being
twins 'born to Ce-'.ta Dibble 'Roberts, the
reputed second Wife of the Congress?
man-elect. These children were re?
ported to be born, he said, August 11.
1897. and until this morning, he had -un?
derstood were acknowledged by Rob?
erts as his. lit could also be shown that
he has been holding out Dr. Maggie
Shipp Roberts as a iv/ife and is now
maintaining the status of husband to?
ward her: that during all of these times
he had living a lawful wife, Louisa
Smith Roberts, who also has 'borne him
children.
It is understood that the opposition
to Roberta has suggested that the wives
with whom he is alleged to have main?
tained polygamous relations be sum?
moned as witnesses. The first wife, it
is said, would be exempt from testy
fying as she has a legal status as wife,
but this exemption would not extend
beyond the first 'wife.
SI' B - ( O M'M ITTEiE APPOINTED.
A sub-committee, consisting of
Messrs. Morris, Littlefield and Miers.
has been appointed to get up forms of
subpoenas, etc.. in connection with the
summ.-.ning of witnesses..
The public hearing went over until
Tuesday morning at 10 o'clock and the
committee held a private session.
Mr. Tayler said, after the executive
session, that the committee was eonsid
ei ing whether it should go no Utah or
have the witnesses come here and that
no decision had been reached.
