THE MESSAGE.
The president's annual mes
sage was read in both houses
of congress Tuesday. The
document lacks the strenuosity
of some of Roosevelt's former
efforts and is probably the most
conservative state paper he has
issued during his administra
tion. It was received with
general approval on the repub
lican side and the democrats
were disappointed in not find
ing it as radical as they had
hoped.
Some of the toalient para
graphs in the message follow:
There is also, I think, ground
for the belief that substantial
injustice is often suffered by
employes in consequence of
the custom of courts issuing
temporary injunctions without
notice to them, and punishing
them for contempt of court in
instances where, as a matter
of fact, they have no knowledge
of any proceedings.
I again recommend the exten
sion of t'ne ocean mail act of
1891 so that satisfactory Ameri
can ocean mail lines to South
America, Asia, the Philippines,
and Australasia may be estab
lished. The creation of such
steamship lines should be the
natural corollary of the voyage
of the battlefleet.
The work on the Panama
canal is being done with a
speed, efficiency and entire
devotion to duty which make
it a model for all work of the
kind,

The dangers to public health
from food adulteration and

should be met and overcome.
Nothing better for the navy

1 take this opportunity pub
licly to state my appreciation
of the way in which in Japan,
in Australia, in New Zealand,
and in all the states of South
America, the battle fleet has
been received on its voyage
around the world.
I again renew my recommen
dation for postal savings banks,
for depositing savings with the
security of the government be
hind them. The object is to
encourage thrift and economy
in the wage earner and persons
of moderate means.
I also renew my recommen
dation that the principle of the
eight-hour day should as rapid
ly and as far as practicable be
extended to the entire work
being carried on by the govern
ment the present law should
be amended to embrace con
tracts on those public works
which the present wording of
the act seems to exclude.
It is earnestly to be desired
that some method should be
devised for doing away with
the long delays which now
obtain in the administration of
justice, and which operate with
peculiar severity against per
sons of small means, and favor
only the very criminals whom
it is most desirable to punish.
The wage workers, the work
ing men the laboring men of
the country by the way in
which they repudiated the
effort to get them to cast their
votes in response to an appeal
to class hatred, have empha
sized their sound patriotism
and Americanism.
The courts hold a place of
peculiar and deserved sanctity
under our form of government.
Respct for the law is essential
to the permanence of our in
stitutions and respect for the
law is largely conditioned upon
respect for the courts.
The establishment of a local
parcel post on rural routes
would be to the mutual benefit
of the farmer and the country
storekeeper, and it is desirable
that the routes, serving more
than 15,000,000 people, should
qe utilized to the fullest pract
icable extent.
This nation's foreign policy
is based on the theory that
right must be done between
nations precisely as between
individuals, and in our actions
for the last ten vears we have
in this matter proven our faith
by our deeds. We have be
haved, and are behaving to
wards other nations, as in
private life an honorable man
would behave towards his
fellows.
If there is any one duty
which more than another we
owe it to our children and our
children's children to perform
at once, it is to save the forests
cf this country, for they con
stitute the first and most im
portant element in the conser
vation of the natural resources
of the country.
1 believe that it is worse
than folly to attempt to prohibit
all combinations as is done by
the Sherman anti-trust law,
because such a law can be en
forced only imperfectly and
unequally, and its enforcement
works almost as much hard
ship as good.
The railways of the country
should be put completely under
the interstate commerce com
mission and removed from the
domain of the anti-trust law.
THE editor of the Omemee
Herald wants to know "What
excuse has the Courant to offer
for the stalwarts in its own city
who bolted the republican leg
isletive ticket?" This news
paper is not the keeper of the
political conscience of any
brand of politicians—stalwart
or insurgent. If any stalwarts
bolted the ticket in this city
they probably felt they had
good and sufficient reason for
so doing—just so did the in*
surgent candidates on the
ticket who bolted some of their
brethren. But what's the use—
the war is over. Let's think
about Christmas and a happy
new yehr and be thankful that
we are permitted to live in the
best county in North Dakota—
best in spite of its measly
political scraps.
THE Overly Tribune hits the
nail squarely on the head in
advocating the raising of the
salary of the railway commis
sioners to $2,500 a year. In
Wisconsin the commission
ers are paid $5,000 a year and
no state has a more efficient
board. As long as the commis
sioners are underpaid—just so
long will they neglect the
duties of their office and make
the board a hissing by-word
instead of a representative of
the people's interest. Raise
the salary and get competent
men on the board. And if any
of the reformers object to the
raise on the ground of economy
it will be evidence that they
are friendly to the railroads and
want cheap men for com
misioners.
OUR genial governor finds
himself up against the real
thing. In addition to the
hungry horde of democrats
who want to get connection
with the public treasury, via
gubernatorial appointment, are
the representartives of over
10,000 bolting republicans who
feel they are entitled to recog
nition. The governor's suave
manner and affidavit face were
sufficient before election, but
now it's different. When it
comes to distributing the pie,
the boys want a bite from the
real article and will not be put
of with a smile.
SHOW PLACE FOR TOURISTS.
Presidential Suite In Washington Sta
tion Bound to Be Greatly Admired.
The presidential suite In the union
railroad station at Washington might
almost be said to be monumental in
character and the aim has plainly
been to make it one of the show
places of a tourist Mecca.
For all that the state suite in Wash
ington's new railroad station is mani
festly designed to be ornamenttil as
well as useful, it may be added that
this presidential suite will fill a long
felt want. Conditions at Uncle Sam's
seat of government are not, to be sure,
parallel to those in the leading for
eign capitals, where ruling sovereigns
are constantly exchanging visits with
one another, and where the arrivals
and departures of royalty result in the
assemblage of great crowds. Never
theless there do arrive at Washington
from time to time distinguished visit
ors bound for the White House, who
must be given an official welcome of
formal character.
Recent presidents have been great
travelers and it has become the cus
tom to invest with more or less cere
monial features their arrivals at and
departures from the capital. Time waa
when only the president's closest per
sonal friends went to the railway sta
tion to see him off on a journey, but of
late years it has been the practice for
all the members of the cabinet and nu
merous other high officials in the gov
ernment service to be on hand on such
an occasion.
Latterly, during the Roosevelt ad
ministration, M. Jusserand, the French
ambassador, and the late Baron
Sternburg, ambassador of Germany
(both close associates of the present,
incumbent of the White House), of
their own accord, joined the presi
dential escort on such occasions, and
with the example set it is becoming
customary for foreign envoys at
Washington to seize the opportunity
to wish the president godspeed, or wel
come home.
Under the old conditions such as
semblages had to take place in the
president's private car or on the ao*
jacent platform—often to the accom
paniment of the incessant din of en
gines and bells. With the facilities
of the new station the president will
be enabled to hold these informal re
ceptions in comfort.

THE BOTTINEAU COURANT, FRIDAY, DECEMBER 11, 1908
Others9 Opinions
USES FOR PUBLIC LIBRARY.
Editor Courant:
Now that Mr. Carnegie has
made an offer to the citizens
of Bottineau of $7,500, for a
public library, provided that a
site be furnished and that the
city council vote to appropriate
$750 a year for the maintenance
of the same, and in view of the
fact that the citizens by a
large majority voted to estab
lish a public library and read
ing room, it may be advisable
to consider plans and methods
for the use of the library so
that we could get the greatest
amount of good at the least
cost.
So far as we can ascertain at
the present time the growth of
the city depends upon our
schools. There is little to at
tract citizens to the town, ex
cept school privileges, as the
surrounding country can only
maintain a city of reasonable
size and when the town has
grown large enough to do all
the business for the surround
ing country, there is nothing
more to make it grow. Our
high school is now rated a first
class high school according to
the standard of this state.
Those interested in educational
matters will agree that the
North Dakota standard is a
high one and the high school
should, and will, attract a
large number of people de
sirous of securing the best
educational advantages for their
children.
The School of Forestry is but
in its infancy, and the wise,
broad-minded foundation laid
by those who have the school
in charge, offers superior at
tractions for those interested
educationally. In order to at
tract outside attendance the
surroundings and influence
must be of the highest order.
People will not send their chil
dren unless satisfied that a
residence in Bottineau will not
be detrimental to them. The
high reputation Bottineau has
always enjoyed as a home city
of superior attractions must be
maintained. A well conducted
library will do a great deal to
establish and maintain the
reputation of this city.
The library should be the
center of the social and literary
interests. This does not re
quire that the building should
be kept open at aH times and
seasons, but so far as the ap
propriation will go, economi
cally, administered, the library
should be thrown open to the
public. Why could not the
building be eo arranged that
the city could use the base
ment for city hall purposes?
At present there is no place
for the keeping of the public
records, nor for the meeting of
the city council. Such place
must be furnished in the near
future by the city. Why could
not the expense of rent or
building of such a place be
saved by the use of the base
ment of the library—provided
the library is located centrally
enough to be of value? The
actual appropriation of $750
then, would cover both lines
of cost and would help to ma
terially reduce expenses.
The board of trustees selected
by the school board is a guaran
tee of wise and judicious
management. Now is the time
for our citizens to purchase a
site and lay plans for the
erection of the building so that
work could begin as early next
year as possible. In a recent
communication with Mr. Car
negie we are asked to prepare
plans for the building. Let
every citizen give the library
commission the fullest, heart
iest support and co-operation.

Galore
You never saw such an array of beautiful gifts
at such bargain prices. Just let us explain to you
how we can do it. We didn't buy early in the year
for future delivery but waited until just a few weeks
ago so as to have our stock fresh and clean, also to
pick up snaps, and we succeeded. Take for instance
in Japanese china. We bought the largest stock we
ever had through the closing out of one of the largest
importing houses. Goods shipped to us in the origi
nal package never opened before it reached us and
laid down at two-thirds the regular price.
In cut glass we bought direct from the factory
a large amount of their surplus stock. In fact we
have one of our large wall cases packed full of cut
glass, making this the largest line ever handled
in one store in this state west of Fargo. Over 150
pieces of best American cut glass,, ranging in price
from $1.25 to $10. Elegant cut bowls at $3.25 up to
$10 for our best cut nine inch bowL
