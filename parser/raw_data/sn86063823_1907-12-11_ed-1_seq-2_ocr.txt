AN AMUSING ORDER.
Albany (N. Y.) Argus, Nov. 25.
The New York Sun lately published
the following Washington dispatch: -
"A federal officer close to the Presi
dent said today that officeholders in
the several states and territories wlio
may accept election as instructed
Roosevelt delegates would do so only
upon pain of dismissal, but ft was
added that there was no objection to
political activity on the part of these
officeholders in the primary conven
tions. The embargo applied, as nearly
as could be learned, only to actual
membership in delegations instructed
for the President. There is no objec
tion to the election of officeholders as
delegates instructed for some candi
date other than the President."
Soon thereafter, substantially the
information above cited began to ap
pear in other dispatches emanating
from the most reliable "cuckoo corres
pondents on the White House list.
They were drawn out, undoubtedly,
by recently published estimates indi
cating that the majority of the next
Republican national convention would
be federal officeholders.
Next came the announcement made
on authority of Internal Revenue Com
missioner Capers, after visiting the
White House, that the President had
issued no such restraining order, and
would issue none such; and then on
the heels thereof it is published that
the President had elected Capers to
the Ananias Club, and given out th
following:
- "It has been called to my attention
that certain officeholders under your
department have been proposing to
obtain election as delegates to th
national convention advocaiing my
nomination or proposing my indorse
ment at state conventions. This must
not be. You will -.lotify such office
holders as is necessary that their ac
ceptance of election as delegates for
the purpose of their advocating such
indorsement will be considered a ser
ious violation of official propriety and
will be dealt with accordingly."
Directly after the issuance of this
latest pronunciamento. Governor Cur
ry of New Mexico took luncheon with
the President, and this is what he
told the reporters about it:
"I have not talked with the Presi
dent about his third term boom. N
friend of the President has to. We are
going to have six delegates from New
Mexico, and the six will be instructed
' for Theodore Roosevelt- I am not go
ing to be a delegate, and I suppose
no federal official will be, but I will
be at the convention whooping it up
for the President, The real friends of
the President need no instructions
from film. They can go ahead and do
what they think wise and best for ais
interest."
What a funny illustration of the
mutations and vagaries of the All Reg
ulator in the White House. But other
wise, what does it all amount to?
Federal officeholders control the
machinery of the Republican party in
this state, in nearly every Southern
state, and in many other parts of the
country. ' It will not be at all neces
sary that they cause their delegate
choosing conventions to instruct for
Roosevelt, in case he should decide
to run for a third term; on the con
trary, it will require the most abso
lute and undoubtedly" sincere refusal
from &lm personally to prevent them
from winding up la the third term
corner, whether instructed or unin
atructed; any tyro In politics knows
that

leaders behind Ihem had agreed upon
a candidate for Governor, and his
name was not Charles E. Hughes. Mr.
Roosevelt at t!ie eleventh hour called
Herbert Parsons to the telephone and
said "Hughes," and within 15 min
utes enough delegations had switch
ed to make it certain that Hughes
would be nominated.
Why? Most of the leaders knew
nothing of Mr. Hughes, and several
of them knew him only to dislike and
distrust him; but they were federal
officeholders, and the big stick of fed
eral patronage controlled them as per
fectly as did Boss Piatt in his palm
iest day.
To have federal officeholders elect
ed as instructed Roosevelt delegates,
whatever may be the ultimate intent
or plan of the President, would be
rather crude and obvious, and it is
quite an unnecessary precaution.
NEW MEXICO PEOPLE
FAVOR STATEHOOD.
From Santa Fe Eagle.
There could be no more positive
proof that the people of New Mexico
are in favor of single statehood than
the earnestness of the meeting which
was Sield in this city lst Saturday.
No more representative meeting has
been held in New Mexico in the advo
cacy of statehood at any time than
this. The joint statehood movement
last year did not begin to arouse the
people as the single statehood move
ment has done, although it has been
only four months since the single
statehood movement was started by
Governor Curry in his inaugural ad
dress. The people of New Mexico want
single statehood and they want it now.
They are looking to the administration
to give it to them, and if congress
should fail to pass a bill providing for
the . admission of the Territory the
disappointment among the masses of
the people will be great. The failure
of congress to pass a bill of this kind
will be charged to the Republican ma
jority which has it in its power to
pass the bill before the end of this
year. Delegate Andrews should work
early and late in the attempt to wjlp
the Republicans into line. He now has
an opportunity to show how much in
fluence he has in congress. If he has
as much influence as he is credited
with he should be able to secure the
passage of the statehood bill without
trouble.
fHREE HUNDRED DOLLARS

"PEACEFUL VALLEY" '
DELIGHTS A CROWD.
The Majestic theatre was ull last
night when Albert Taylor and his own
company of accomplished players op
ened a .three nights engagement with
a production of "Peaceful Valley." The
play was full of human interest and
was put on in such a manner as to
appeal to the artistic -sense of the
most exacting. . The general verdict
was that it was a splendid show. "A
Southern Romance" is the bill for to
night, and tomorrow night the compa
ny concludes with "A Poor Relation."
Incidentally, the company will put on
a bargain matinee tomorrow after
noon, open to everyone, but especially
for the ladies and children.

the character for his patience, his perseverance against odds, and
above all for nis kindness, his quaint philosophy and his rare good

Mr. Taylor is acclaimed by press and public as the only man
who has ever successfully followed Mr. Sol Smith Russell. The
management guarantees that "A TOOK RELATION" never had
