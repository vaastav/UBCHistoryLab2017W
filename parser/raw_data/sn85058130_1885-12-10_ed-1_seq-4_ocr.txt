THE MESSAGE
The President message is one of the
most exhaustive documents of the kind
ever presented and were it not for a
few blemishes would place Mr Cleve
land among the advance ranks of
American statesmen and executives
He rises above partisanship and speaks
broadminded deepthinking man
1 who realizes that he is at the head of
the sreafc American republic There is
1
little that is narrow in the treatment
of the various matters touched upon
his views being those of the advanced
I
j thinkers of the country who are de
i votedly attached to the nation and
I bent on its maintenance its develop
ment and its growth A large portion
i of the message is devote 1 to a statement
1 of our foreign relations and to sug
i i gestions as to what should be our
t policy with regard to other countries
I It Every American citizen who is in har
mony with the patriotic idea of the
nations grandeur and greatness will
I feel prouder than before after reading
t what the President says concerning
our position and policy among the nations
i
titans of the world He elevates the
J republic and attaches more importance
1 to American citizenship than has been
i t l given to it by some of his predecessors
F i It is a fact which cannot be disputed
J that the American dignity end import
t ance abroad is in the citizen Himself
more than in any respect that is enter
tained for the country by the great
powers of the world So little attenticn
has been paid to affairs beyond our
own borders that other countries treat
American citizens civilly not because
they we ciizens of a republic able and

account

count without reference to his citizen
ship if Cleveland can ha e his way
P
the United States will be regarded by
the nations of the world in a better light
thanit has been for these many years
It Is painful to note the Presidents
transition from the plane of lofty
statesmanship to the level of the vulgar
politician Mr Cleveland gives two

the best good of the people
down to the level of the violentlypartisan
hired press corres
newspaper editor or
pondent m the treatment of the Mor
mon question HOT doesthis read in
the most important State paper
that will come from the President a doc
ument that will be a part of the ex
ecutive and legislative history of the
country
The strength the perpetuity and the
of the nation rest upon our
destiny
homes established by the law of God
Warded by parental care regulated by
parental authority and sanctified by
parental love These are not the homes
of polygamy The mothers of our
land who rule the nation as they would
the characters and guide the actions of
their sons live according to Gods holy
ordinance and each pure and happy
in the exclusive love of the father
of her children sheds the warm
light of true womanhood upper
verted and unpolluted upon all within
her pure and wholesome family
circle These are not the cheerless
crushed and unwomanly mothers of
polygamy The fathers of our families
arc the best citizens of the Republic
wife and children are the sources of
patriotism and conjugal and parental
affection beget devotion to the country
The man who undefiled with plural
marriage is surrounded in his single
home with his wife and children has a
stake in the country which inspires
with respect for its laws and courage
for its defense These are not the
fathers of polygamous families
This would sound all right in an anti
Mormon newspaper and might be
looked for in a missionary tract designed
for the conversion of the Saints to
an abandonment of their belief
and practices regarding marriage but
who will say that it is appropriate
language for a Presidential message
Old man Hoar might be expected to
talk in this way when pleading for the
passage of a bill for punishing the
Mormons but it is undignified and im
proper in an executive message Vulgar
politicians and howling demogogues
I excite the people with such language
but Presidents ought not to resort to
this method It looks as if Mr Cleve
land were stooping in order to catch
popular applause No one for a
moment ever hoped the President
would pass the Mormon problem by in
silence all expecting be would call at
tention to the condition of things in
Utah and that he would make sugges
tions to Congress but few thought he
would be otherwise than dignified and
statesmanlike in his utterances That
he has not been so will grieve his
friends and admirers outside of Utah
who are as much opposed to the
Mormon system as he can possibly be
We regret that Mr Clevelands
first message which began so well
and which is generally so able
and brilliant should have been
marred and dimmed by so much
that is ordinary and commonplace It
drops him as a man and a President
and one rues from its perusal with his
opinion of Mr Cleveland somewhat
lowered
OSE FRANK H BEERS was until very
recently a lettercarrier in Chicago
but now ho is seeking employment
When ho gets another job he will pro
babiy not talk himself out of it as he
I did in the case of the last one While
riding in a street car ho was heard to
say that Hendricka ought to have
been dead and in hell years ago and
that if anything should happen to
Cleveland he didnt see thatthe country
would suffer A gentleman who over
heard the remark reported it to
Superintendent Donovan who with the
indignant gentleman immediately went
in search of the young man They
found Beers delivering mail and he
tried to apologize for his indecent re
marks but was cut short by the super
intendent who indignantly discharged
him on the spot There are a good
many offensive partisans of the Beers
stripe in the government service to the
shame of the President be it said
THE LATE VicePresident Hendricks
never took kindly to his office When
placed on the ticket with Tilden it was
I against his wishes and we are all
familiar with the great pressure that it
required to induce him to accept the
nomination last year His idea of the
position of VicePresident was illu
strated by a remark he made to a
Senator who nodded towards Wheeler
the Fraud VicePresident who was pre
siding over the Senate and asked Hen
dricks if he felt envious Nopromptly
replied Hendricla No
place has any
attraction for me where all the strain
CAmJS on the seat of the trousers
Senator Sherman who has just been
elected President of the Senate evi
dently entertains views different from
those of the late VicePresident

For seven years 1 suffered with t cancer
Ill ray face All the simple remedies were
tpplted to alleviate the pain but the place
continued to row finally extending into
iny nose from which came yellowish dig
charge very offensive in character It was
a so inflamed and annoyed me a great deal
About eight months ago I was in Atlana
at the house of a friend WhO so strongly
recommended the us < i of Swifts Specific
that I determined to make an effort to pro
cure it In this I was successful and began
its use The influence of the medicine at
first was to somewhat aggravate the sore
but soon the inflammation was allayed and
I began to improve after the first two
bottles My general health has greatly
improved lam stronger and able to do
an kind of work The cancer on my face

until thero is not a vestige of it leftonly a
little scar marks the place where it had
been I am ready to answer all questions
relative to thit cure

I have had a cancer on my face for tome
year extending from ono cheek bono
across the nose ti the other It has given
me a great deal of pain at times burning
and itching to such an extent that it was
almost unbearable I commenced using
Swifts Specific in May 1885 and have used

lief by removing the inflammation and re
storing my general health W BARNES

the use of S S S 1 feel constrained by a I

this statement of my case With the four
teenth bottlo the cancer began to heal
rapidly and soon disappeared and for
several months there has been no appear
ance of a sore of any kind on my nose or
face neither is my nose at all tender to the
touch I have tKeu about two dozen bot
tles S S S and am soundly cured and I
know that S S S effected the euro after
every known remedy was tried and had
failed ROBERT SMEDLBY
Fort Gaines Ga May 11885
J had heard of the wonderful cures of 1
Swifts Specific and resolved to try It I
commenced taking It In April 1884 My
general health was much improved yet the
cancer which was in my breast continued
to grow slowly but surely The bunch grew
and became quite heavy I felt that I must
ei her have it cut or die But it commenced
dijicharging quantities of almost black
thick blood It continued healing around
the edges until February when it was en
tirely healed up and well
