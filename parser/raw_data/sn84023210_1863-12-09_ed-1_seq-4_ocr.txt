A large batch of prisoners was taken yester

ted to go iDto the servioe, or to furnirih substi

Mr. Davis offered a resolution, that the refu
sal ot the rebel authorities to exchange nogro

Mr. Sherman called up his resolution that the
Judiciary Committee inquircand report whether
Robert Wilson is still a Souator troiu Missouri.
Mr. Fessenden objected to recognizing Mr.
Wibon as in anyway as Senator from Missouri.
It would be a bad precedent, lie had no ob
jection, however, to the inquiry being made.
Mr. Hale could see no use in the reference.
The Senate had repeatedly made decisions which
tettled the principal of the case, especially in
regard to Judge Phelps of Vermont, and subse
quently ot Mr. Williams.
Mr. MoDougal said that the law of the ques
tion had been settled and as a friend of the gen
tleman from Missouri he was sorry that he
thought he had a claim.
Mr. Powell thought that the whole question
depended upon the fact whether the Legislature
of Missouri had really adjourned sine dio, or
only took a recess before coming together lately
and electing a Senator.

" The author of the volume before us endeavors to de
scribe what heaven is, as shown by the light of reason
and Scripture.
It proves, in n manner as beautiful as it-is convincing,
the doctrine of the reeogi.i io.i ot friends i n heaven It
demonstrates tlie interest which those in heaven feel ie
earth mid nn.i-s with remarkable clearness that such an
I interest exi-ts not only with tire Almighty ami among t're
1 angels, but also among the spirits ol rh- departed friends.
I We unhesifCn "ly give our opinion that this Tohime is
one of the most delightful productions of a religious char
uc.er which . h. appeared for some time, and we would
I desire to see it pass into circulation." Glwjow Jonrtra.
" This work gives positive and social views of heaven as
' . .nmiipructinn to the neirative and unsocial asix-cts iH
which the subject is so commonly, presented." Eng'Ult
Churchman.
' Amid the works proceeding trom an overtcemmg
press, our attention has d-en arrested by the perusal o1
the above-named production, wlrirh, it seems. Is wending
its way daily among persons of all denominations. Cer
tainly,1' Heaven our Home," whoever may be the author,
is no common productfon." Airdrit A .x trliser.
' In boldness of conception, startling minuteness of de
lineation, and originality of illustration, mis work, by the
anonymous author, exceeds any of the kind we have ever
read." John O'Ciroat Journal.
" We are not in the least surprised at so manv thou
sands of copies of this anonymous writer's work being
bought up We seem to be listening to a voice and lan
guage which we never heard before. Mat ter comes at com
mand ; words How with un. tudud ease , the pages are lull
of life, light, and force ; and the result is a stirrini: vol
