hall. Pueblo will gladly take It. Trank
Ishell Is willing to try the Colorado town
and Is Investigating the situation in Pueblo
s to base ball prospetts now.
Oenver, the only city In Colorado that
s now In the Western leagua, la naturally
anxious to see more base ball In Colorado,
as Is shown by the following clipping from
a Denver papet:
"The best thing that could happen for
the good of professional base ball In Colo
rado would be the restoration of a West
ern league club In Pueblo. It would help
Denver particularly and If a Success at all
would greatly benefit every club In the
league. Frank Isbell is now negotiating
with Pueblo business men with the object
In view of bringing the Witches to Pueblo.
Indication! point to a successful termina
tion of the deal. There Is no reason why a
city of the slse of Pueblo cannot support
a minor league ball club. It can and will.
I believe. If the right kind of men are
.placed in control of affair and a first
division team put In the field.
"The trouble at Pueblo heretofore has
been that their club could do no better
than sixth place In the leagua standing.
No town will put up .with this. If Isbell
decides to locate In the smelter city he
will remedy the weakness. With Pueblo
in the Western league map again Denver
will be able to save considerable money
which last year went to defray expenses
of eastern clubs on thelc long Journeys to
tliis city. At the same time the teams at
the other end of the circuit will be corn
Milled to make fewer long Jumps."

Grand Island School Doard Considers
Proposition to Drop Game.
ORAND ISLAND, Dec. 8. (Special. )
Member Kdwards of the local Roard of Ed
ucation has Introduced a resolution look
ing to the elimination of the recognition
bythe school authorities of foot ball as a
requisite sport. It provides that hereafter
foot hall shall not be played under the
auspices and the name of the high school.
At the request of the Introducer the reso
lution went over for final action for one
month. At the same meeting the proposi
tion of eHtabllshing a course in gymnastics
for both boys and girls, making participa
tion compulsory, was placed before the
board and referred to a committee for re-
riLirt. A canvas of the members seems to
ndlcat that foot ball will retain Its
wonted encouragement by the school au
thorities and that a course In gymnastics,
voluntary on the part of the student, will
oe adopted.

Maroon Stadents Want Michigan
Bark la Conference Fold.
CHICAGO, Dec a-8tudent critics at the
University of Chicago took a parting shot
at the "blj eight" foot ball question yester
day when they came out tn favor of Michi
gan's readmUelon to the conference group
of college. In an editorial In the Daily
Maroon, the student publication, the offi
cials of the paper UlHgnoeed tha trouble
between Michigan and Its former athletlo
acquaintances as "a false sense of dignity'
and urged the renewal of relations.
Acordlng to the Midway rooters, there Is
no reason to fear trouble from Minnesota
or any other ''big eight'' Institution In the
way of a protest. The friendly editorial
contained the following comment on the
recent meeting of the faculty representa
tives, at which future competition wltn
Michigan was forbidden:
"Not even the moM partisan can declare
that there was anything hut fairness in
any of the rulings passed. The clause for
bidding any conference college from play
ing any team from any unjverslty Mt has
been a member of the conference, and has
wlthdi-awn was the only logical thing to
do under the circumstance s. There Is added
that Cole was a comer, and his prediction
certainly came true. The catcher also
spoke highly Of "Buck" Weaver, hut said
then he needed a little more grooming, and
when he returned to the team this fall
Needham aald he would do. In the game
Weaver pitched ' he proved everything
Needham said of him.

Hackenschmidt seemed to rely only on his
strength.
The two men tugged and pulled each
other about the mat for over an hour be
fore the first fall went to tha foreigner.
Several times Hackenschmidt attempted
to throw his opponent over hi head, but
on each occasion his grip gave way.
Westergaard worked harder. He worked
his opponent to the mat and then squeezed
Hackenschmidt' head until tie foreigner's
strength told on the Iowan hnd the hold
was released. Westergaard T rushed at
Hackenschmidt even or eight time, lifted
him bodily and threw him to tba mat.
Th second fall came tn quicker Urn.
Hackenschmidt rushed at hi opponent at
the call of time and In a few minute both

(From a Stnft Correspondent.!
WASHINGTON. Dec. 8 (Special Tele
gram.) Repreecntative Burke of South Da
kota, chalrlnan of the committee on Indian
affairs, reported the Indian appropriation
bill to the house. It being the first of the
largo appropriation bills to come from the
committee. The bill carries an appropria
tion of $8,100,883, being SM,3 less than
last eyar's budget and 314.725 greater than
estimates from the commissioner of in
dlan affairs called for. The probabilities
are that the fight regarding Indian ware
house will be renewed on the floor of the
house when the bill come up for discus
sion. The committee has so worded the
bill as to practically rut out warehouses.
The paragraph which In former years read
"for rent of warehouses," now makes no
mention of warehousej whatsoever, the
paragraph reading "for the purchase of
goods and supplies, transportation and
storage," eto
This puts it up to the administrative of
ficers of the Indian department to deter
mine where they will store their supplies.
The departments deBlre to store goods at
Chicago and San Francisco only, these
being two points from which goods may
be shipped Into Indian country most
Cheaply, so It Is contended. New York, St.
Louis and Omaha members are certain to
make a fight for retention of the ware
house with their cities, but no on knows
what the outcome on this particular item
may be.
Money for Indian School.
Chairman Burke, while engaged In trim
ming, did not omit seeing that South Da
kota Is still on the map. At Rapid City
Indian school a new girls' dormitory, cost
ing i:u,000, 1 provided for, and a central
heating plant that will st Uncle Sam back
310,000 is provided for.
Tha Pierre schools are Included for $15.0x10
more. Thee Items, however, are neces
sary to complete the projects authorized
by the last bill, which named $100,000 to
complete the new school building and $15.00)
to finish an Irrigation system now well
under way.
When one comes to consider that the In
dian bureau was not adverse to abandon
ing the Genoa Indian school one year ago
that school is to far welt by having under
the house bill, as reported, $36,000 for the
erection of two new dormitories and a total
of $90,000, by Mr. Burke bill.
Fenator Brown introduced In the senate
today an amendment which h proposes to
urge to tha Indian bill which will provide
for 825 pupils Instead of 300, and for sal
aries $68,225. Also, Mr. Brown will urge an
appropriation of $30,000 for erection of a
boy' dormitory ind, further, $o,600 for
building a cottage for th superintendent
and $6,000 for general repair and improve
ments, in all $96,725. Therefore, It will be
een that If Senator Brown' amendment
regarding the general school prevail It
will receive $ti,82o more than I accorded It
by the house bill reported today.
Now Rural Routes.
Th lid which baa Deen damped down so
hard and fast by Postmaster General
Hitchcock for three month or more In re
gard to the establ'shment of new rural free
delivery route, or even allow tha old
one to be extended, hes been lifted and
about MOO, either entirely new route or
extension of old onee, will be established
within the next few weeks.
The discontinuance of th establishment
of new rural route waa Inaugurated aa
one of the method by which Postmaster
General Hitchcock sought to overcome th
annual deficit in th administration of postal
affalro. The money for these new route
had been aproprlated, but Mr. Hitchcock
of his own initiative sought to go against
the wishes of congressmen and had in
tended to "pinch out" on the rural free
delivery fund a nice little sum of money
and turn it back Into the treasury. But
th congressmen who had demand from
their constitutenta for better rural delivery
service, more especially on older routes,
wheie the demand was Juit and reasonable,
got to nosing about Mr. Hitchcock's de
pal tment and found that about l.lOrt new
route which had due fanctlon of the
superlntendotit of free rural delivery, hav
ing been duly examined aa required by law,
were held up by a dlrrct order from the
roHtmaxter general. Representative Daw
son of Ion a advised a fw congi e.-slonal
friends, and as a result of their cbjectlons.
he deemed It wise to put all rural free
delivery routes upon which favorahel re
ports had been made by officers In the i
field Into oieratlon as fat as might be
done.
For Railroad Com petition.
Senstor Norris Brown today Introduced
the following hill In the senate:
"That no railroad corporation which 's a
common carrier subject to the acts
to regulate commerce approved February
4. 1887, as amended, shall hereafter acquire
directly or Indirectly any Interest of what
soever kind in the capital stock or pur
chase or leas the railroad of any railroad
corporation owning or operating a line of
railroad which Is competitive with that
of such first named corporation respecting
business to which said act to regulate com
merce, as amended, applies: and an' cor
poration which acquires any Interest In
capital stock or whlrh purchases or leases
a railroad contrary to this action or which
holds or retains any Interest In the capital
stock or In a railroad hereafter acr-ilrcd
n violation of this section shall be fined
$6,000 for each day or part of day during
which it holds or retains uch Interest un
lawfully acquired."
This Is the amendment which Senator
Brown offered to the Interstate commerce
act of last session. Iti purpose Is to de
stroy the only easy and practical way of
merg ng railroads now in competition. The
senator believes the surest way to preserve
competition among the railroads Is to pro
hibit them under heavy penalties, from
owning each other' stock. If the owner
ship of railroad can be kept separate and
independent, the public 1 much more likely
to enjoy the benefit of comvtUlon. It is
understood it has the support of the ad
ministration. It wa specifically recom
mended by President Taft In hi message
last year, but was defeated In tha sen
ate when offered s an amendment to the
commerce bill. .

Now that the time for coasting and other winter sports is at
hand, we want to speak a word of WARNING, with particular
reference to COASTING.
On all streets on which there are street car tracks, and on
all hills which cross or terminate on streets having street car
tracks, there is a CONSTANT DANGER to those indulging in the
exhilarating sport of coasting.
Men and women, as well as boys and girls, have lost their
lives, or have been seriously injured by dashing into moving
or standing cars on their sleds or travelers.
Why jeopradize your lives by coasting where the hazard is
so great, when tnere are so many places in this city of hills, where
this sport may be indulged in with perfect safety?
