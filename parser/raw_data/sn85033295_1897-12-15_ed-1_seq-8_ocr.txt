Dependent and Neglected Children.
The state board of control invites
the attention of the people of Wiscon
sin to the state public school for neg
lected and dependent children at
Sparta, and asks assistance in finding
homes for the children sent to that
institution. There are no doubt many
who would like to adopt or receive on
indenture such children, but who do
not know how to proceed and in fact
many do not know that such an insti
tution exists.
The school is intended simply as a
clearing house. The children sent
there through misfortune or neglect
are kept only long enough to find suit
able homes for them to enter. They
may be adopted or may be indentured
until 21 years of age, after a reason
able trial, should it appear that the
conditions are favorable to the best
interests of both the child and the
family.
There are about 250 children, most
of whom are ready to be placed in de
sirable homes. Among them are
seventy-five boys from three to eight
years of age, who are especially desir
able for adoption.
Any person desiring to take a child
on trial should communicate with the
Superintendent of State Public School
at Sparta, Wis., who will send an agent
to the person applying or will furnish
any desired information concerning
the children, rules, etc.
—We do a money loaning, insur
ance and real estate business.

The Hoppe Will .Sustained.
The contested will case of Carl
Hoppe, late of the tow r n of Shields,
was tried Saturday, December 4. When
Mr. Hoppe died he disposed of his
property by a will, drawn by Philip
Kiefer and signed by him as a witness,
and also by Wm. Hoppe, a sen cithe
deceased. Mrs. E. Tibbits and Mrs.
Sumner Lewis, of this city, are daugh
ters of the deceased, and each was to
receive $250 under the terms of the
will. They were evidently not satis
fied with the shares given to them and
retained Malone & Bavhhuber to con
test the will. It was tried in county
court and Judge Christiansen decided
in favor of the contestants. An appeal
was taken to the circuit court and
after hearing the evidence, Judge
Dick held that Wm. Hoppe was a
competent witness (that being the
main point in the controversy) and
directed that the will be admitted to
probate. Attorneys C. R. Blumen
feldand Harlow Pease, of Watertown,
appeared for the proponents of the
will.—Juneau Telephone.

Washing-ton Letter.
i From our Regular Correspondent.]
Washington, December 10, 1897.
The most astounding thing brought
to light by the first week of the ses
sion of congress is the audacity of the
agents of the lobby which is trying to
prevent the annexation of Hawaii, It
is only necessary for a senator or
representative of prominence to ex
press in private conversation the
slightest doubt of the wisdom of an
nexation to have these agents an
nounce through such newspapers as
they control or by hook or crook
obtain space in—ca,sh is unquestion
ably paid in some instances—that
the senator or representative in
question is straining every nerve to
defeat annexation. They have thus
misrepresented Senators Morrill and
Hoar and Speaker Reed', It seems as
certain as anything can be that such
audacity is in the end bound to react
upon those who employ it, and to re
sult in making more votes for annexa
tion than against it. This lobby was
started by the sugar trust, but there
are reasons for believing that a por
tion of ttie money it is spending so
liberally comes from the secret funds
of three foreign nations that desire to
prevent annexation, but have no
reasonable excu-e for attempting to
do so openly. Some of the Demo
cratic senators who talk the loudest
against trusts, during a campaign,
are acting in concert wilh the sugar
trust now. In fact, with two excep
tions, Gorman and Morgan, all the
Democratic senators appear to have
landed, bag and baggage, in the lob
byists’ camp. Senator Davis, of Min
nesota, chairman of the committee
on foreign relations, which has
charge ol the treaty, is thoroughly
confident that annexation will be ac
complished t (trough the treaty, and
absolutely certain that a bill provid
ing tor annexation can be passed by
both senate and house, should the
power of the lobby be sufficient to
prevent the ratification of thetreaty.
It is his intention to push the matter
to a conclusion in the senate at the
earliest possible moment.
The house committee on appropria
tions broke the record when it re
ported the pension appropriation
bill to the house this week, thus fur
nishing evidence that Chairman
Cannon and the industrious members
of his committee intend to do their
part towards pushing the imperative
business of the session, in order to
help along the project for early ad
journment, which is generally fayored
by Republicans. The pension bill
carries $141,218,830, of which $140.-
000,000 is for the payment of pen
sions.
It has already been made appar
ent that a serious attempt is going
to be made at this session of congress
to modify the civil service rules.
President McKinley having stated in
his annual message that lie believed
many positions were now embraced
by the civil service rules which ought
not to be, Republicans in congress
do not feel that they are antagoniz
ing him or the party platform in tak
ing part in tins movement, although
so good a Republican as Representa
tive Johnson, of Indiana, has told
them in a speech in reply to General
Grosvenor, of Ohio, that he disagreed
with them. General Grosvenor's
idea, which be will endeavor to get
through in the shape of a bill, is that
the only employes of the government
who should he embraced by the civil
service rules are the clerks, whose
duties are executive, in the depart
ments at Washington and employes
of the postal service in all branches.
All other positions he desires to have
thrown open and the Democrats
who now hold fully nine-tenths of
them thrown out to make room for
Republicans.
President McKinley’s beingdetained
at Canton by his sad duty lias not
in any manner inconvenience 1 con
gress, as he arranged all matters re
quiring his personal attention before
starting upon his last trip to the
bedside of his dying mother. Every
where his mime is mentioned the
deepest sympathy is expressed for
him.
The committee on hanking and
currency has obtained permission
from the house to sir daily during
sessions of t he house, and will at once
endeavor to agree upon one or more
hills embodying portionsof thefinan
cial recommendations made by the
president in his annual message and
by Secretary Gage in his annual re
port to congress. Secretary Gage
has been asked to put his ideas into
a hill and submit it to thecommittee.

cure for consumption and all bronchial,
throat and Jungdiseases, general decline and
weakness, loss of flesh and ad conditions of

be a curable disease beyond any doubt and
has on file in his American and European
laboratories testimonials of experience from
those benefited and cured, in all parts of the
world.
