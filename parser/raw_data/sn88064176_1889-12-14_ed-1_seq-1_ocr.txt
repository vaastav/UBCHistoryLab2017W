Jefferson Davis Dead.
Hon. Jefferson Davis died in the
city of 'New Orleans at 12:45 on
Friday morning, Dec. 6th, at the
residence af Justice C. E. Fenner.
His death was not unexpected and
the immediate cause was a congest
ive chill He was eighty-one years
of age, having been born in Christ
tian Co., Ky., in 1808. His name
will go down in the history of this
country as one of the most distin
guished statesmen it ever produced.
While not entirely free from that
asperity which firm conviction be
gets, his most bitter enemies are
forced to honor his unswerving de
votion to principle; and, the calm
simple dignity with which he treat
ed all attacks upon his character,
while it showed his nobility, silenc
ed the tongue of the slanderer in
confusion. He is said to have had
one of the most remarkably bright
minds in this country, noted for its
gifted men, and his literary attain
ments were perhaps superior to
those of the prominent men of to
Jay, and up to the hour of his death
his intellect remained bright and
anclouded. No man living or dead
held such a hold upon the affections
,f the Southern people, and the
nourning and grief exhibited for
rim is something grand. During
he two days he was lying in state
n New Orleans more than fifty
Thousand people viewed his re
nains. One of earths noble men
ass gone to rest.

The President's Message.
In his message to Congress last
week President Harrison deals with
a great variety of subjects, but in
no instance is he pronounced and
decided on the issues of the day.
He mildly calls for a revision of our
tariff laws, and then straddles the
subject by saying that the protec
tive principle must be maintained.
A reduction of the surplus in the
treasury is recommended, and lib
eral approprations for coast de
fense, navy and river and harbor
work, is suggested in strict keeping
with Mr. Cleveland's idea. In the
matter of enforcing the civil service
law, and legislating against unlaw
ful combinations of capital, he also
follows the Cleveland lead. Atten
tion is directed to the race issue,
and the question of elevating the
negro receives considerable com
ment. Protection to Federal officers
and witnesses, and the establish
ment of intermediate courts to re
lieve the supreme court of work is
recomended, while the sugestion
for a Federal election law is care
fully concealed and cloaked in
heneyied words. Taken as a whole
the document is tame and hardly
comes up to what was expected by
both parties.

Is many inastances t has been proven
that B. B. B. (Botanic Blood lBam),
made by Blood Balm Co., Atlanta, Ga.,
will cure blood poison in its worse
phases, even when all other treatment
fails. A. P. Branson, Atlanta, Ga.,
writes: I bad 4 running aleers on
one leg and 6 on the other, and felt
greatly prostrated. I believe I actu
ally swallowed a barrel of mediiue, I
iu vain effects to cure the disease.
With little hope I finally acted on the
urgent advice of a friend, and got a
bottle of B. B. B. I experienced a
change, and my despondeney was
somewhat dispelled. I kept using it
until I had taken sixteen bottles, and i
all the ulcers, rbeamatimem and all c
other honrrors of blood poison have
disappeared, and at lasu. I am sound
and well again, after an experience of
twenty years of torture. Bobs. Ward,
Maxey, Ga., writes: My disease was
proUounced a tertiary form of blood t
poison. My faec, head and shoulders i
were a mass of corruption, and finally
the disease began eating my skurl
bones. My bones ached; my kidneys
were deranged, I lost feeh and strength
and life became a burden. All said I
must sreld die, bat nevertheless, when
I had used te bottle of B. B. B. I

Mr. Harrison's message was read
in both houses of Congress to-day.
It is too early to say what is
F thought of it, as few members pay
close enough attention to express
an opinion on it; they prefer to
read it over carfully afterwards.
But it certainly was not received
with any enthusiasm by the Re
publicans. That much could be
plainly seen by any person that at
tended the opening of Congress.
Gen. Clark, the clerk of the last
house, called the new house to or
der at noon to-day, and he is prob.
ably the last Democrat who will
have the honor of presiding, even
temporarily, over the. house until
the first Monday in December, 1891,
when a Democratic speaker is again
expected to be elected.
Senator Quay, aided by the silent
support of the administration, suc
eeded in making Reed speaker of
I the house, just as your correspond.
ent from the begining prdi
but it may in the future prove to
be a dearly bought victory for Mr.
Suay, as he has made some enemies
Sthat will not hesitate to get even if
the chance ever presents self, and
it generally does in political as well
as private life. One enemy that
Mr. Quay has made, he may well
beware of It is J. M. Carson,
Washington correspondent of the
Philadelphia Ledger, who had the
audacity to become a candidate for
clerk of the house without consult
ing Mr. Quay. Mr. Carson claims
that majority of the Pennsylvanian
delegation had pledged him their
support, which virtually meant his
election, as the place was conceded
to Pennsylvania, and that Mr.Quay
by open threats succeeded in com
pelling the meest of them to support
his candidate for the place, Edward
SMcPherson, Seretary of the e
publican Congr~eional committee.
McPherson got the nomination, but
Mr. Quay got the enmity of Mr.
Carson, who wields a great in.u
easem-mn the newspaper e,
who resent Mr. Quay's saying that
Mr. Carson only represented a lot
of irresponsible newspaper men.
No politician has ever antagonised
the Washington newspaper men
without paying very dearly for it.
Ex-epeaker Keifber will bear me out
in this assertion as also would the
late Schuyler Colfax if he was alive.
Keep your eye on Quay.
The newspaper correspondents
are heartily glad that the speaker
ship farce is ended. They were re
qured by their peers to telegraph
daily aonnts of the fiht, when
there was no t. There has
been no time witin the last three
months when the fact was not per
fectly plain to an imprtial observ..
er that feod would be speaker.
There were two reasons for the ez
aggerated newspaper accounts of
the alleged cotestk One war op
position to Beed and the hope that
a real contest might be brought
about by the sham publications,
and the other was the desire on the
part of the correspondents to earn
their salaries.
The Democratic caucus to nomi
nate house odleers was d for
last night, but owing to tabsence
of a quorum, was s until
this m krin at 10 o'lock when
Mr.l Cale received the nomina
tion fot' speaker and all the old
house o ials were renominated.
No other business was trausated.
