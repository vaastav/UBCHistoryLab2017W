IIip Monroe Doctrine
Ycnc7iiels anil some others in tin
lesser Americas would do well to
carefully iornc that portion of tlie
Presidents message r ferritin to the
Monroe Doctrine In plain
i states that the p iarantee of pro
tection will not be extended to coer
Infringement of the lights of Utiro
pcans If Germany or other Towers
conclude that thtv must have redrew
and indemnity for the ill treatment
of their subjects tic Inltcd States
will not intorfire except to prevent
the acquisition of territory
This hlghlj sensational interpreta
tion of the Monroe Doorine ought to
have effect The South American
countries have been cutting capers
long enough Most of the revolutions
- are ttriteecssary and ridiculous and
shrjply afford opportunities for the
adventurous element to wield tem
porary power Unfortunately this
endangers the rights of men of ninny
nationalities injures commerce men-
noes life and creates a generally dis
agreeable situation
- If the smaller UcpnuKcs persist in
actlnc lise viciousJv niischievoussniall
boys they must expect to be soundly
spanked and their 1ncle Samuel
need not be expected to interfere
A New Couslltnttonnt Qnestlon
A new constitutional question is
to be raised it seems It is Has
Congress the power to protect- the
President of the United States from
attempts to murder him by provid
ing an adequate punishment for the
offence
The Judiciary Committee of the
Senate is to make the enquiry and
therefore we shall not anticipate its
decisions 1ml if Congress cannot
pass n law intended to preserve the
life of the Chief Magistrate of the
nation against an assault this Gov
ernment is afflicted with a weakness
which ought to be cured b constitu
tional amendment
There is no doubt that the Presi
dent can protect himself He may
kill his assailant for example or as
Commander-in-Chief of the Armv he
may suriound himself with soldiers
who will defend him and in defending
Jiim they may kill his assailant with
impunitj If the luvv cannot punisii
by its orderly in a case
where it excuses killing done at the
moment and violently It is the first

The suggestion is a good one and

the financial standing of Mr Carnegie
who can embirk upon Mich colossal

Other men however kindly disposed
to their fellow creatures are with
held from the experiment by the
great possibility of failure They

As a matter of fuel such criticism
does not apply to Mr Carnegies

Two bills have been introduced into

prohibit games of football between

It is n pretty good idea to shelve bills
which do not posi ess sufficient merit

Chicago Chronicle There Is no real rea

at the unwillingness of the Central and

choice and by habit They havt a high
sense of personal and national honor
which It Is possible they arc disposed on
some occasions to exaggerate but In what
respect does their attitude differ from
that of thd most advanced nations of the

Tlie people of the United States are

to buy and get more value for their
mjney than at any past stage of our
national development Despite the short
crops in several States of tho great corn
belt the farmers arc out of debt and
have cash in the banks The railroad
situation would be eminently satisfactory
but for the fact that a great rauny of
the important lines are in tho same con
dition that hampers the Atchison more
business than tbey can well handle There
is a shortage of cara and engines ow
ing to the heavy transportation demands
on all parts of our system

Cotton goods are In better request but
mills delay new undertakings because of
the sudden rise in raw material
Staple products continue advancing
corn making a most sensational gain
Extraordinarily high prices for this cereal
tempted many traders to sell futu o con
tracts In expectation of a sharp reaction
but a further violent rise to the highest
price for many years compelled covering
at severe losses
Wheat was alo sharply advanced to
the best price of the season largely
through sympathy with corn for which It
was freely substituted
Cotton was aroused from Its lethargy
by an unexpectedly low official estimate
of the current crop at only 9674000 bales
when about 1000000 more was predicted
by the members of tho leading exchanges
Vigorous speculation and an advance of
over 2 a bale occurred when the low
yield was announced
Exports of gold were not of sufficient
volume to affect money market conditions
but the persistent strength of exchange
and heavy absorptioa of funds from local
