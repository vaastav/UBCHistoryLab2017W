iiioTAtri is " ,,M,tt
rebeli" np.et ad r
Ity when th.r g po. P'7 'l1"
trated in TnnMee. That State, until the
reeoot election, in which the people took
part, was intomel loyal in ell departments
ot in government. It preented thet
anomaly in politice of en intensely Rad
ical end loyal government, with a eo culled
intensely disloyal constituency, the adminis
tration beiuff under the auspices and in the
interest of those who ley great stress on a
republican form of government. At the
August election this deformity in political
architecture and alienation between people
and government was removed, and the gov
ernment made to harmonize with the ill
of the people. Thin change of coure
brought into offioa representatives of the
10 called rebel clement, who, we were as
lured, would undo all that loyalty bad dime
for the State. Well, it appears that this i
to be the cae, for the telegeaph brings the
newt from Nashville, that one branch ol the
Legislature bat actually paned a bill pro
viding that the salaries of all civil officers,
exoepting the Governor, Judgee and Chan
cellors, bow in office, ahall be reduced one
half, the same reduction extending to mem
ber! of the Legislature, Judges, Chancel
lor! and Governor! hereafter elected. The
disloyalty of tbie measure ia fearfnl when
it is remembered that the salaries just re
duced were voted to themselves by a receof
carpet baggers and home made loyalist!,
who had but little or no property to pay
taxes oa, and were therefore loyally partki-
tmnti only in tlie benefits, and not in the
t
burdens of liberal compensation for die
tinguished official eervices to the State
Will Congress take notice of this flagrant
departure from Radical paths by the rebel
I. ei'islature of Tennessee, and institute an
r - i
inquiry into the right of a tax-ridden, prop
erty-holding people to relieve themselves of
oppressive burdens, and protect themselves
from robbery '
THE CONSPIRACY AGAINST GEORGIA
$Tbe outrageous recommendation of Prei
iduut Grant that the whole civil structure ot
Georgia be uprooted by a Radical Congress
Vieciwui iv U,lUtw W refused lu ndmit
to seat! in that body a few negroes, on the
ground that tbey wore not eligiblo to seat!
under the constitution, indicates too clearly
the evtent of bis subserviency to the worst
phasea of Radicalism. 'I hut the whole
sclietuu is a conspiracy against the state
government and pcoplu of Georgia, in the
iDiBreit of a lew Radical malcoulents, there
is s.arcelv a doubt. Thatthis is the case,
aud that Geu. Grant has lent t'ne iniluence
of his high oilico to a coterie of desperate
plotters ami despicable politicians of small
calibre, we introduce the following from the
New York Wot Id, whose editor has traced
thesoheme to its source:
The Augusta, Macou, and Columbus pa
pers, just at baud, expluin the whole of
this shameful conspiracy. The Republican
State Central Committee held a caucus at
Atlanta on the 1st inst., and reBolved to at
it-mot to induce Congress "to take a snap
iudiiineut uimn Georgia, before the I.egis
inture could of its own motion satisfy the
demands of Conifress by reseating lb
negro members and ratifying the tilieenth
amendment. They agreed to ask Congress
to annul a. I legislation so far had nnder the
constitution of 1807. put the Statu under ft
euberualurial dictatorship, with Mullock as
supremo reconstruetor, so that, backed by
the military power, "the negroes should bu
reseated, and the Legislature purged of ev
ery man who cauuot take the reconstruction
test oath." This is exactly what the caucus
resolved to ask on the 1st ol Pecember; n
is exactly what President Grant reenrn
mends on the Glh of December. Governor
Mullock departed for Washington immedi
atelv alter the caucus, and that bn l.ui had
good sucoess in his missinn the President's
message abuudantly proves. Mefore he left
Georgia, Mullock issued an extraordinary
proclamation, reciting at length numerous
so-called political outrages committed during
the past i'ourteeu months, fur the purpose ot
taking it to Washington and displaying it
there as evidence that a state of intolerance
towards Radicals and Republicans exists in
Georgia. Noao o' shese outrages have any
political bearing at all; aud even Forney,
whj visited Georgia a short time ago, was
so impressed with the peaceful and harmo
nious state of things there that he printed
the other day, in one of his papers, an ap
peal to Congress to let nil tho Southern
alone for tho future, on the ground
that they were doing well enough, and that
all f-Ttlir-r interference with them would bo
prejudicial and injurious. Mut tho conspir
acy has succeeded, as fir as the President
is concerned; he has shown his willingness
to be male the tool of tho Georgia carpet
baggers; and it now remains to be seen if
Gongreas will be equally subservient. If
the State is li-i't alone she will do her duty
aud, if necessary, she will even ratify the
tilteeuln amendment and admit the negro
members to their sea's. But this will not
satisfy the ambition of the adventurers.
They demand that the whole work of recon
struction be done over again, in order that
they may be kept in power a little longer.
There is perhaps a faint hope that Congress
will refuse to aid their schemes, at such a
cost; although, now that the President has
Iwen made a party to the conspiracy, the
chances of its success are only too great.
The Cunningham Dnrdell Murder.
We have already mentioned the death ol
Eckel in Sing Sing prison, and the fact that
he made a dying statement about the Cun
ningham Bard ell murder, in which he was
supposed to have been implicated. We take
from the Albany Argus the subjoined ac
count of Kckel's deaiU aud reference to the
murder itself :
Oil Friday night, John J. Eckel died at
the Albany pcniieutiary, of heart disease.
Kckei was sent to the penitentiary over a
year ago, together with Calioott and one or
two other prominent members of the whisky
ring, for frauds upon the Internal Revenue
kckel was still more extensively known to
the world from the fact that he was arrested
and indicted upon the charge of being im
plicated in the murder of Dr. Harvey Bur
dell, the wealthy Bond street dentist. This
ease is oiie of the envres aU'brti in the
. criminal history of the United States. The
murder itself was shocking; but the subse
quent developments through which it was
sought, at ouce, to acquit Mrs. Cunningham
of the crime and to establish ber right to the
property of tU murdered man the bogus
marriage, in which somebody in disguise
personated Dr. Burdell to Mrs. Cunning
ham'e role ol bride, ana in which the Rev.
Uriah Marvin, formerly of tts city, figured
at the officiating clergyman, the bogus baby
plot, the trial and acquittal of the principal,
who waa almost universally believed to be
the murdered these and other incident,
made the case one of tbe most - exciting cri
minal trials that ever ocenred in tbe history
of tkii country. There waa, we believe, bo
vidence suthoieut to justify Kckel s eon-
yiotion, end tbe ground! of hie arrest were
the fact that he slept in tbe Bond street
house on the night of the tragedy, and that
he was understood to be a lover of Mrs.
Cunningham.
Ii was alio suspeoted that he was tbe
person who personated Dr. Burdell in the
bogui marriage. There were considered
to be lulHcient grounds to juitify bi! arrest
and indictment as an accessory to the tnur
der;and np to tbe present time suspicion bas
attached to him in tbe minds of many, con
nesting bim with the fearful tragedy.
After the announcement had been made to
Eckel that he must die, we are informed
that, at the suggestion of a prominent citiztn
Kckel's partner in crime, Calicot, had an
interview with him, for the purpose of draw
ing from him any disclosure be might feel
disposed to make in regard to the murder of
. , ,1 l. , . L .. . l.'-l...l ...... V,ut.
lit. Burden, it is eiateu mm .i:ei kuiu
ically declared that be was entirely gui'
of any connection with the cum, J that
he did not know who cow"'"1' it. lie
added that tie entered"' house about 1 1
o'clock on the nigh of the murder; that he
was met by Mrs. Cunningham in the lower
hall; that he noticed that she appeared cou
fused and excited; that she preceded him up
stairs to his room; that she stopped on the
wy up stairs and closed Dr. Murdull'i room
dour, that she accomnaned bun to his own
bed-room door, where he left her, locked bis
doer, and retired to bed: and that ho wa
entirely ignorant of the murder untill after
the discovery ot tue uoay. inn aisieiiirui
was made a short timebetore his ocatn, ana
in view of the fact that his physician had
informed him that his end was near, ana
that be could not possibly survive. Given
under such lolemo circumstances, it will
doubtless be generally believed, especially as,
while It exonerate! himself it adds one more
link in the chain of testimony, which pointed
to Mrs. Cunningham as the murderess of Dr.
Burdell.

The Wheie WoiUVs VcUnm,
Hn TJlCer Cclll KeSiSt it!
Why docs it Cnre ?
Because it is Oomnosed solely of rare, disin-
feotant. purif"ing and tonic vegetable substan
ces; because it penetrate, the iLtiamed or ulcer
ated flesh throueh and through; because it
cool?, soothes and tones tho irritated surface ;
because It 1- the specific aotweto ot tbe acrid
poison which produces virulent sores, boils, tu
mor., and all external exeresenoe. ; because it
eradicates instead of suiipre&.siug eruptive and
ulcerous disesse..
Where it is Used?
Everywhere! There is not a civilised settle
ment betweeu Alaska ami Patagonia where it is
not appreciated. Well may it be called a pcue-
tratiug preparation in a commercial as woll as a
medical sense, lor, with its potent ally, iioiio-
wiiv'. Pills, It bus reached the centre of China
and the heart of Japan, aud is advertised at Pc-
kin und Jeddo. Over three hundred millions of
the human race that have never heard of any
other ton ign medicmo have l ien made acquaint
ed tnrouitn their own papers, una many thous
and, of them by actual experience, with the
nropcrtu. of Jlolloway s Ointment and Jloiio-
wey's Pills;
Open Seres and Unhealed Wounds.
In con.efiuence of being cicatrized before the
virus of inflammation has boen expelled, .ore.
supposed to h uve been cured often break out
afiesh. It is the same with old wounds. A thin
orust thnt deceives tbe eye overlies tho tnoulder
ine embers of disease, and tbey lire us sure to
break through the surface eventually ssa volca
no is to recommence its throes and- cast up new
floods of lava. But -ho operation ot the Oint
tnent is final. All tho irritatiug humors are dis
pelled, and when natiiTe, thus relieved, closes up
tlie wound or uircr, tho euro is penect.
To Suffering Mothers.
The agony that, some young lno'hers undergo
from the caking of milk in tho brensts, ulcera
tion of the hippie and other painful alVeotions of
the tramillary organs, is extreme. And jet a
few ft phoations of the Ointment would ruuiove
tho difficulty and enable tho sufferers to resume
the mnternal function and continue to exeroise it
without interruption or pain. As tho life of the
child as well as the health of the mother may
depend on her ability to nurse it, this fact, which
is verified ny amine testimony, snonia no treas
ured in the memory of every wife and matron.
Hemorrhoids, Pulmonary disorders
Obstinate ch.-ob of piles that have defitd all
other treatment Hie often cured very rapidly by
the freiiuect spplicatiun uf the Ointmeut to the
inflamed membrane. It must be used with such
genilo friction s tho patient csn bear. When
rubbed briskly over the throat and chest, in bad
coughs and cubit, asthma, inflammation of the
lungs, bronchitis, uicenited sore throat, Ac., it
imparts wonderful relief and prevents the com
plaints Irom culminating in Consumption. The
Pills may be given night and morning during the
continuance of a cough or cold to carry oil the
moroid humors.
Contracted Limbs and Sropsical
Swellings.
The reputation acquired by the Ointment ns a
mean, ot utii.zing sun joints, ny re-enoowing
them with flexibility und uctivity, is as wide as
the ran?? oi i-iviliiation. Persons who havenot
touched tbe ground with one, or perhaps either
leg for yean, bc'tno able to step out firmly
without any other help than a cane, and in some
instances without requ.ring even that assistance.
Dropsical swellings are reduced and tho deposi
tion of water in the cellular tissue arreted by tbe
tonio action of the Ointment. In all these cases
it is essential that the preparation be faithfully
aud vigorously rubbed in.
CAUTIt'N The words "Ilolloway's New
York and London," are watermarked on each
leaf of the directions in which the boxes and
pots are folded. For information leading to the I
detection of counterfeiters of tbe medicines, i
handsome reward will be given, gold ft tbe
manufactory. No SO Mr-'den Lanu, and by re
spectable druggists and dealers ia medicines
