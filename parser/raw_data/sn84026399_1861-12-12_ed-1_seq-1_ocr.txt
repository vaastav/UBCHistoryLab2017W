There are three vacancies on tbe Bench
of the Supreme Court, two by the do
cease of Justices Daniel and McLean,
and one by the re.-ignation of Justice
Campbell. I have so far forborne mak
ing nominations to fill the vaoancies for
(S
reasons
wbich I will now state. Two of
the outgoing Judges resid.d within the
States no overrun by revoli, so that if
eucce-sors were appointed in the same lo
caliiies they could not now serve upon
their circuit-, and many of the most com
petent men there probably would not take
the personal hazard of accepting to serve
even here upon tbe Supreme Bench.
I have been unwilling to throw all the
appointments Northward, thus disabling
myoelf from doing justice to the South on
tbo return of peace, although I may re
mark that to transfer to tbe North one
wbich has heretofore been in tbe South,
would not. with reference to territory and
population, be unjust. During tbe Iouk
and brilliant judicial career of Judge Mo
Lean, bis circuit grew into an empire al

j becomes more and more apparent There
J are np courts nor officeisto whom the cit-
jzeo 0f other States may apply for tbe
j enforcement of the ir lawful claims against
oitizeoM of tbe insurgent State, and there
is a vast amount of debt constituting sucu

$200,000 000, due in large part from in
sureuts in open rebellion to loyal citizens
who are even now making grent sacrifices
in tbc di'cbarjje of their patriotic duty to
support the Government. Under these
circumtanco8, I have been urgently soli
cited to establish, by military power,
courts to administer summary justice in
such cases.
I have thus far declined to do it, not
beoause I bad any doubt that the end pro
po-ed tbe collection of the debts was

been unwilling to o beyond tbe pressure

whether by a voluntary return to allegi
ance and order, or by tbe power of our

Thi", however, is not to be a permanent
institution, but a temporary substitute, and
to ceaso as soon as tbo ordinary Courts
can be re established in peace. It is im-
nortant that some more convenient a;eans
(shall be provided, if possible, for tho ad

ment. especially in view of their increased
; number, by reason ot tbe war. It is as
much the duty of Government to render
prompt justice agaiut itself in favor of
citizen-, as it is to admiui-ttr the same
between private individuals.
fbe investigation and adjudication of

cial department. Besides, it is apparent
that the attention of Congress will be

to wbiob should be added tbe earnings
of the'Department in carrying free mat

The total expenditures for 1863 are c
timatcd at SI2,5S,000, leaving an esti
mated deficiency of 33,145.000, to be
supplied from the Treasury, in the pr
manent appropriation.
The preent insurrection slows, I think,
that tbe extension of this District across
tbe Potomao river at the time of estab
lishing the Capitol here, was eminently
wise, and, consequently, that tie relin
quishment of thut portion of it which lies
within the State of Virginia wan unwise
and dangeroas. I submit for your con
sideration the expediency of acquiring that
part of tbc District aod tbe restoration of
the original bouodariett thereof, through
negotiation with tbe State of Virginia.

reason to believe that many who are now

Da5 directed a suspension of tbe payaent

I recommend, that Congress authorize

The Territories of Colorado, Dakoiah,
and Nevada, created bj the lat Congress
have been organized, and civil adminis
tration has been inaugurated therein un
der auspices especially gratifying, when
it is considered that tho leavan of treas
on was found existing in some of these
new countries when the Federal officeri
arrived there. The abundant maritime
resources of these territories, with tbo se
curity and protection afforded by an or
ganized Government, will doubtleea invite
to them a largo imigrotion wha peace
shall restore the bu-iocss of the country
to its accustomed channels. I sabmit the
resolutions of tbe Legislature of Colorado",
which evidence the patriotic spirit of tbe
people of the territory.
So far the authority of the United
States has been upheld io all the Terri
tories, as it is hoped it wilTbe in the fu
ture. I commend their interests and de
fence to the enlightened and generous
oare of Congress.
I recommend to the favorable consid
eration of Congress the interests of the
District of Columbia. The insurrection
has been the cause of much suffering and
sacrifice to its inhabitants, and as thej
have no Representative in Congress, that
tbey should not overlook their just claims
upon tbe Government
At jour late session, a joint resolution
was adopted, authorizing the President to
take measures far facilitating a proper
representation of the industrial interests
of tbe Uuited Stat at th-i Exhibition of
the Industry of ail Nations, to be holden
at London in the year 1862
I regret to say. I have been unable to
give personal attention to tbis subject a
subject at ooce -o interesting in itself.and
so extensively and intimately connected
with tbo material prosperity of tbo world.
Through the Secretaries of State and of
the Interior, a plan or syxterja has been
devised and partly matured, and which
will be laid before you.
Under and by virtue of tbe Act of
Congress, entitled "An Act to Confiscate
property used for Insurrectionary Purpo
ses," approved August 6tb, lb61, the le
al claims of certain persons to tho labor
and service of certain other persons
bare become forfeited, and numbers of
the latter thus liberated, are already de
pendent on the United States, and mast
be provided for in some way. Besides
tbis. it is not impos?ir-le that some of the
States will pass similar enactments for
their own benefit respectively, and by op
eration of which persons of tbe same class
will be thrown upon thorn for disposal.
Io such cases I recommend that Con
gress provide for accepting such persons
from such States, according to some mode
of valuation in lieu pro tanto of direct
taxes, or upon some other plan to be a
crced upon, with uob States respeatively
that uch persous or such acceptances by
the General Government be at once deem
ed free, aud that, in any event, stepa be
taken for colonizing both classes, (or tbe
one first mentioned, if tbe other shall not
be brought into existence,) at some place
or places in a climate congenial to tbem.
It might he well to consider, too, whether
the free colored people already in tbe U
nited States, could not, so far as individ
uals may desire, be included in such col
onization. To carry out the plan of colonization
may involve the acquiring of territory,
and, also, the appropriation of money be
yond that to be expended in tbe territo
rial acquisition. Having practiced the
acquisition of territory for nearly sixty
years, tbe question of tbe Constitutional
power to do so is no longer an open one
with ns. The power was questioned at
first by Mr. Jefferson, who, however, in
tho purobae of Louisiana, yielded his
scruples on the plea of groat expediency.
If it be said that the only legitimate
effect of acquiring territory is to furnish
homes for wbito men, this measure effects
that object, for tbo emigration of colored
men leaves additional room for white
men remaining or coming hero. Mr. Jef
ferson however, placed tbe importance of
procuring Louisiana more on political and
commercial grounds then on providing
room for population.
On this whole proposition, including
tho appropriation of money with the ac
quisition of territory, does not tbe expe
diency amount to absolute necessity, that
without which the Govermcnt itolf can
not be perpetuated if tbe war continues.
In considering tbe policy to be adopted
for the suppresing the insurrection, I
have been anxious and oareful that the
inevitable conflict for this purpose shall
not degenerate into a violent and romorse
less revolutionary strogglo I have, there
fore, in every case, thought it proper to
keep the integrity of the Uuion promi
nent, as tbe primary object of the contest
on our part, leaving all questions which
arc not of vital military importance to the
wise deliberation of tbe Legislature.
In tbe exercise of ray best discretion I
have adhered to the blockade of tbe ports
held by tho insurgents, tnstead of putting
in force, .by proclamation, the law enac
ted at the late session for clo-ing these
port. Sa, alo. obeying the hictates of
prudence, as well as the obligation of
law, instead of trancending, I have-adhered
to the act of Congress to coneate
property uied for insurrectionary purpo
ses. If a new law upon tbe satao subjeet
shall be proposed, it propriety will be
duly conidered.
