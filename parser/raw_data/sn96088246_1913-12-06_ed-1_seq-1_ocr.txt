we should let the Sherman anti

is, with its debatable ground
about it, but that we should as

A telegram from Manager C.
C. Chapman, in charge of the
Oregon exhibit at Chicago, states
that his section of the show is
crowded at all times by farmers
and others eager to secure first
hand information regarding this
state. The Oregon display is
declared by competent judges to
be by far the best at the show
when quality, variety and effect
iveness of staging are considered.
Mr. Chapman and his assistants
are kept busy all and every even
ing in answering the vast number
of inquiries showered upon them
by people of every class. The
demand for public talks and
lectures on Oregon and the
Pacific Northwest generally is
almost too great to be satisfied.
"OUR BILL" HANLEY IS
BOOSTING FOR HARNEY
Government To Aid In
Forming Juvenile Clubs
"Oregon First and All Oregon"
is suggested as the slogan of the
Oregon Exposition commission
in charge of arrangements for a
display from this state at San
Francisco in 1916. In addition
to a building of Oregon wood,
furnished with Oregon furniture,
with a restaurant serving Oregon
food and with sidewalks made of
Oregon brick, it is now proposed
that soil be taken from Oregon
to completely re-surface the
Oregon building site on the Ex-
iHisition grounds, and to plant
therein native Oregon flowers,
shrubs and small trees. To secure
the necessary material for such
planting, it is suggested that an
exhibit garden be established in
Portland and school children all
over the state be enlisted in the
work of collection. The com
mission has been assured that
space for such a garden would
be provided, free, on the campus
of Reed College. If but one
speciment is received from each
of the 2500 schools of the state a
considerable tract of land will be
required to care for them until
they are shipped south for per
manent planting.

Within the past few days
canned and dried fruits valued at
$15,000 have been shipped from
the Eugene Fruit Growers' can
nery. The shipments included
four carloads of apples returning
an average of $800 per car to the
growers. The carloads sent to
the East have been sold at more
than $2.00 per box, of which 50
cents is deducted for freight
Two carloads of prunes were also
shipped, each car bringing about
$2,500 to the producers.
Declaring that speculators by
combining for the control of
prices have made fortunes at the
expense of the hop industry
during the last 20 years, a meet
ing, attended by 70 representa
tive hop men, was held at Salem
a few days ago. Deciding that
by an organization of their own
the hop growers can regain and
keep control of the market in the
future, a committee was appoint
ed to draft a comprehensive plan
for a statewide union among the
growers. According to the plan
discussed, the union will main
tain an information bureau with
agents at London and New York
to keep it advised as to market
conditions and prices. It is es
timated thai through such organ
ization at least $76,000 per year
can be saved to the growers in
the matter of supplies, which
could be bought in wholesale
quantities, and an additional
$125,000 in commissions which
have heretofore been paid to
middlemen for disposing of the
crop.

interviewers, for, in the congest

from the wide west whose
epigrams and bits of philosophy
are as welcome as fresh air.
A year or so ago Mr. Han ley
chaperoned Governor West and
his fellow executives on a tour of
the east and he arrived in New
York wearing a necktie, the red
ness of which flagged even the
jaded eyes of the hotel rejiortcrs
and at once his droll recitals of
the landless areas of the far
west won columns of recognition.
As a publicity scheme for Oregon
he was a net success.
This year his triumph has been
repeated, for upon running up to
New York after attending the
conservation congress at Wash
ington Mr. Hanley's views on
Wilson and war and incidentally
on farms and foodstuffs were
much sought after. In its last
Sunday's number, the New York
Times devoted more than a
column to Mr. Hanley, who in
the course of his remarks, took
occasion to plug liberally for
Oregon in general and Harney
county in particular. His re
marks are quoted in part as
follews:
"The stale of Oregon lately
has gone in a great deal for de
veloping by putting up to the
agricultural college the responsi
bility for the success of the
farmers of the state. Demonstra
tion farms, short courses in
agriculture, and traveling ex
perts have had great results.
Farming is cattle raising and
cattle raising is farming now
days. Meat producing is no long
er a free-range business. Food
for cattle has to be grown.
"The great opportunity nowa
days is in the country, and not in
the city. There is no question
but that we should be able to
meet any local demand for beef
and farm products in this country,
and at reasonable cost, if the
same amount of interest were
turned to that line of endeavor
that has been turned to other
lines that have done so well in
this country. There is still plenty
of land to be had in Oregon at
from $5 to $30 an acre. Harney
county alone has about 4,000.000
acres open to homestead. People
can come in and take it up nnder
the government land law. The
enlarged homesteads of 320 acres
are now based on a cultivation
of crops, not upon living on the
land, which is fairer.
"The people in Oregon," said
Mr. Hanley, "ure very happy
just now because they are getting
big prices for all their products.
Those who have worked long
enough, now have automobiles
and all the modern luxuries, and
those that haven't feel that they
soon will have such things.
Most of the farm boys and girls
are taking courses in agriculture
or domestic science, and expect
to go back to the farm.
"If we are going to keep up
the kind of government we have
now, we have got to have a new
condition of distribution between
country life and city life, and a
bigger percentage of people in
this country must own pieces of
the country. 1'eople who live in Sauer kraut
cities must own property in the Dalton & Co.
I Transportation is a big equalizer
I of sentiment. Nobody is any
I farther away from a place than
i the time it takes to go there,
and home is really only a place
where you can make a living.
"The old fireside," said Mr.
Hanley, "is mighty chilly when
you haven't the wherewithal to
keep a fire in it."
An Interesting Program.
A group of ladies of the Libra
ry Club presented a very inter
esting and instructive program
at the home of Mrs. I. H. Hol
land Saturday evening, it being
the annual open meeting of the
Club when the gentlemen were
permitted to be present and en
joy it. The evening was an en
tire success in every particular
and those present were well en
tertained. The discussion of the evening
was the Panama canal. Well
prepared papers were read and
Dr. Ellis gave an illustrated lec
ture on the canal showed many
good pictures of the work, which
were thrown on a serene by a
stereopticon. Mrs. W. L. Blott
was first called upon and told
the "Story of Panama," from an
early time when it was first con
sidered possible to build a canal
and of the efforts of those in the
past and finally the successful
fulfillment by the United States.
Mrs. ('has. Kohn read an in
teresting paper on "Sanitation
on Panama" which gave one an
idea of the tremendous under
taking to make it possible for
white people to live there and
finally accomplish what has been
done. Enormous expenditures
were made and lives sacrificed to
bring this about. Mrs. Harrison
Kelley next gave those present
"A Journey Through the Canal"
in a most interesting paper.
This was followed by Dr. Ellis
with her illustrations. Miss
Georgia Ellis read an address de
livered by Mr. Hart before the
teachers of Washington on "The
Panama Canal and our Civic
Responsibilities." This was a
most enjoyable number and much
appreciated as was the entire
program.
Several selections were played
by a Victrola during the evening
and at the close of the literary
program those present were ask
ed to join in singing the Star
Spangled Banner with Mrs.
Kembold at the piano.
A delightful luncheon was serv
ed following the program during
which the Victrola was again
placed in motion for the enter
tainment of the guests. It was
a very interesting and profitable
evening and the ladies are to be
congratulated on the excellent
work they are accomplishing and
the intelligent manner in which
they discuss practical things of
the day.
The United States Department
of Agriculture will cooperate
with the Oregon Agricultual
College, through its Extension
division, in forming girls' and
boys' clubs in Oregon. Satis
factory assurance of interest in
the work of promoting these
organizations among the young
people of Oregon was given by
the Federal authorities to Pro
fessor R. D. Hetzel, director of
College extension work, at a re
cent conference held in Washing
ton, D. C. It was further stated
by the Federal officers that
educational funds will soon be
appropaiated to assist in form
ing the juvenile clubs and carry
ing on the lines of work best
suited to Oregon conditions.
As guaged by their popularity
in other parts of the United
States, these clubs are eminently
successful in encouraging study
and work along the lines of the
chosen subjects. In the corn
states many corn clubs have been
formed among the boys. In the
work of the members was in
cluded study of scientific and
practical questions, such as those
of seed, soils and management,
and the practice of testing and
and judging the corn. Boys'
pig clubs are just now receiving
especial attention from the De
partment, and may be made a
part of the club plan in Oregon.
Already cooperation exists be
tween the College Exension divi
sion and the Federal department
of Agriculture, and its applica
tion to the work among Oregon
farmers is to be made more
general and effective. Profes
sor Hetzel has just made a very
careful study of the cooperative
extension work in the Southern
and Eastern states, and hopes to
see its best features utilized in
bringing to the Oregon farmers
the advantages offered by the
combined service.

pace with the multiplication of
the pests upon which they feed,
has destroyed them until their
