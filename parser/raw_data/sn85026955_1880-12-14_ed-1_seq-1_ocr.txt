Southern development will soon come.
This will arrive thiotigh divisions in the
white ruling element and when
the divisions come the negro
will be an object ol protection and In
terest to all political parties. Through
tills division something like an honest
ballot will be secured and the rights of
all respected. The President thinks that
education In the South Mill ultimately
restore the harmony between the sec
tions and raise the negro tOf a plane of
development where he will ' be able to
protect himself. It is iu this portion of
the Message that tho President may be
said to review his administration,
i ii u Moiimon ji;i:sriON.
Upon the Mormon Question the Pres
ident uses plain language mid urges Con
gress to adopt such measures as will se
cure the speedy abolishment of Dial evil.
I'he President says that the fact that so
largo a community has been permitted
to live in Open evil in defiance of the
laws of the United States and of morali
ty, Is a national disgrace, and one that
should be remedied without delay. Con
gress Is called upon to give early anil
earnest attention to this subject, that the
people of I' tah may be required to con
form to the same laws and regulations
that govern the restol the country. The
President suggests, to Congress that if
there, is no way of reaching polygamists
under the present organization of the
Territory that its entire system of local
government should lie reorganized with
a view of providing a swift and speedy
method of prosecuting and properly
punishing all who persist Iu practising
Polygamy. Those who have credited
Ilie'Presi'dent with having become con
verted In a measure to looking with len
iency upon Mormon practices ihrough
his recent visit west will have their
mind thoroughly disabused by reading
this energetic appeal to a retiring Demo
cratic Congress.
CIVIL RlillVlCX ISEKOHM.
The next subjocf discussed Is one that
will not attract great public attention.
J t is devoted to what the President is
pleased te call civil service, and Is one of
the longest chapters In the Message.
Tho financial chapter Is the only ether
one that, approaches It hi length. In
theory Mr. Hayes believes Iu appointing
good men to ot'llce and continuing them
(luring good behavior. He believes, al
so, in the theory of separating govern
ment services from politics, elaborates
his well known theories upon this sub
ject, mid points In Illustration to the Im
provement made In I In? administration
of the New York Custom House and In
the New York Tost Otllce.

He then takes up the subject of our
foreign relations, as presented by the
Slate Department, and reviews the con
dition of affairs between the government
and leading foreign jiovernmentg
There ure three subjects that are outside
of the routine report of pleasant relations
with oilier countries. The part relating
to England gives the current history of
the North American llsbeiies question,
and repeats the views or the President
in it special message that lie sent to Con
gress last spring, which In effect, recom
mended the rosinralion of duly on Caii
Hiliaii ttsh and llsli oil. The recommen
dation of the Secretary of State iu re
gard to Inipioving our commercial rela
tions by the co-operation of the entire
consular scu Ice as agents in promoting
the Interest of American eeinmeree, are
eaiiieslly commended to the attention ol
Congress. The full reports of the ln
vestlgstlona of our consul.! and the bet
ter channels Indicated by them for a
profitable commerce are used by the
President, to recommend legislation for
the development of oiu merchant ma-
f'ue. ... . ,
The President does not believe In sub
sidles, but be docs approve of giving lib
eral mall contracts to pioneer merchant
marine enterprises as one means of en
coiirsglng an Industry which he thinks
through an unwise policy Is now lan
guishing. TUB KKW f lll.ST.Si: TKKATIKH.
The next subject of special Interest In
our foreign relations consists of a recital
of the appointment of the Chinese Com
mission mid Its work. The President
promises to send a special message on
the subject when the rull text of the
treaties Is received at the Stale Depart
ment. The point of these treaties Is giv
en so far s it Is proper l divulge them
at llic present time, lie says that the
first treat V Is a modification of the Ilur
llngame Treaty, and solves satisfactorily
the Chinese question In politics III lb s
country. The Chinese government s
not at iill anxious In have Its subjects
emigrate, and was willing to meet, our
Commission more than half way In all
restrictions upon Chinese Immigration

mission. The point of the second treaty
relates entirely to commerce; bill as the
Slate Department lias not got the lest or

port is never anything more than a re
view of reports of his subordinates, nil
of which have been published.
tiik war dkpahtmknt.
ruder tho head of the War Depart
meut, which comes next,, the President
only makes one strong recommendation
and that is in most earnest approval of
General Wright's late report upon the
necessity-of strengthening our const de
fences. At the present time all of tho
great commercial ports of the United
States nro absolutely in a defenseless
condition, mid In the event of foreign
trouble Incalculable damage could be
done to our commercial, interests beforo
the first steps of u real defence could be
made. The President calls upon Con
gress to take this subject into considera
tion and to provide for a system of lib
eral appropriations to remedy this great
weakness.
TIIK NAVY DKPARTMEXT.
The Navy Department gets but a short
chanter, and this tor tlie reason mat hec
rctary Thompson asked for but, little to
lie inserted iu the message. He speaks
in Eulogistic terms of Secretary 1 liomp
son's nHiiageinent and approves of the
Secretary's plan for the encouragement
of our merchant murine, already alluded
to under Ihe head of the State Depart
ment. The same suggestion by the
Postmaster General is also approved.
lie docs not endorse Mr. Maynard's sug
gestions. Ho recommends only tlie
adoption of a post olllce savings bank
scheme, but says nothing about the pos
tal telegraph.
UKI'ARTMKXT OF Jt'STlCE.
Under the head of Department "or
Justice the President speaks ot the At
torney General's recommendation that a
siiftlcieut amount be appropriated by
Congress for the payment of the deputy
marshals. He also rcjommends that
Congress pass some bill authorizing the
establishment of an Intermediary court
between the United States Circuit courts
and the Supreme Court, for the purpose
or relieving the extraordinary pressure
of business under which tlie latter is
struggling. The most pronon need fea
ture of Attorney General Doyens' report
the President does not even diseusi; and
does not mention It in the message. At
torney General Devon, in an elaborate
m iniier, urges upon Congress the pro
priety of national supervision ,of the
ballot In all national elections, and re
commends that Congress take the posi
tion that in national elections Slate lines
are not to be considered and that na
tional authority be directed lo protect
tlie ballot box from fraud and Intimida
tion in all sections of tlie country. The
President, while agreeing with tho Ideas
of General Devens on Ibis subject, did
not think It best to incorporate this re
commendation in the message.
tiik iNTi:i!iDii mtahi.mi:nt.
The Interior Department is given
quite a long chapter. The President re
views Secretary Schurz's policy toward
Ihe Indians with great approval, and
thinks that bis plan for educating the
Indian, so that lie can lake care of him
self, the only true solution of tlie Indian
question. lie calls upon Congress lo
give aid In tlie way of appropriation!- lo
encourage this plan, which looks to lh
establishment of the Indian iimiii lands
of his own, breaking up of all tribal re
lations and the gradual withdrawal of
financial support, upon (lie part of the
government. Following this review of
the departments Mr. Haves has a special
ly good word to sav for the work of the
('oimulssloner of Agriculture, mid
speaks of the success of Mr. Ee Due In
his experiments for the growth of tea In
Ibis country and (lie manulacture of su
g.ir from cornstalks.
The President next alludes lo the re
port of the Commissioner of. Education.
The chief point of this paragraph of the
message Is tho President's recommenda
tion that the remainder of the public
lauds of the country be s-l aside for ihe
education of Illiterate persons of nil sec
liens. This would result, the President
sav, In giving nm.l of it to the South
wiietc Ihe greatest Illiteracy prevails.
The education of this class, both while
and black, would have a tendency lo
place the two seel loin upon a closer In
tellectual level, and consequently In a
closer bond of union.

Then follows the eloslii'; chapter of
Mr. Haves' last annual message. This
relates entirely to affairs of the DlstrlW
of Columbia. No President has evet
taken more Interest In the District than
Mr. Haves. The Improvement of the
Potomac Klver flats Is recommended ,m

Taxing: K!roiitl4.
Whenever a non-taxable, railroad is
sold out under a deed or trust it becomes
liable to taxation, if we understand
aright a decision rendered last Monday
by tho Supremo Court of tlie United
Slates iu the case of the E. T. V. & G.
. K. Co. r. Hainhliii county, Tenn.,
on appeal from Supreme Court of Ten
nessee. Tho Supreme Cnurt of the
United States held that that case was
governed by that of Morgan rs. Louisi
ana (113 U. S. 21 7), in which it was de
cided that immunity from taxation is
not such a franchise of a railroad corpo
ration as would pass by sale under mort
gage on "the property and franchises of
a company." The "franchise" of ex
empt ion froin taxation thus disappears
in a cloud. Tlie original company lias
it. As long as they own the railroad It
remains a valuable privilege. I!ut, pres
to, change ! theo give a deed of trust,
the road is sold, and Ihe right of exemp
tion vanishes. The ow ners lose it. The
new ones do not gain It. Anyhow, it is
