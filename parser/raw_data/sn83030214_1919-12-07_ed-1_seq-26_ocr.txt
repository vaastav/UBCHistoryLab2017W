Rise in Sugar
Stocks Feature
Of Dull Market
Tobacco Shares Also Ad?
vance Sharply, With List
Generally Irregular;
Profit-Taking in Evidence
A particularly dull market was en?
livened yesterday by active demand for
sugar stocks, which resulted in bidding
up prices of these issues from 2 to
more than 18 points. The sugar stocks,
stimulated by the rapid advance in the
price of the raw product, and the lift?
ing of government control, havo dis?
placed the motors In popular specula?
tive ?avor. Approximately 10 per cent
of the total transactions on the Stock '
Exchange were in four sugar issues, j
Second in point of activity and j
strength were the tobacco shares, in I
which pool operations appear to be
most pronounced. Steel, oil and equip?
ment issues, in which selling pressure
was greatest, weakened and with hardly
an exception close well below Friday's
tinal quotations. In spite of the an?
nouncement that holders of Republic
Steel were to get rights in a block of
stock to be bought out toward the end
of this month, the shares of that com?
pany lost 2 points on the day's trading
The market was irregular throyghout
the session. The usual week-end profit
taking was in evidence, both in the
nature of short covering and sales for
long account. Some stocks were
bought on the possibility that a deci?
sion on the question of whether or not
stock dividends are taxablo as income
might be handed down Monday by the
United States Supremo Court.

The Dollar in Foreign Exchange
The dumping: of huge quantities of
bills against the shipment of cotton,
grain and other commodities overseas
into the market during the last week
carried exchange rates on the leading
Allied capitals to new low records. The
pound sterling has fallen in terms of
the dollar more than 20 per cent below
the normal parity. Sterling was quoted
at $3.85% at the close yesterday, com?
pared with $4.00\'i a week ago.
The dollar would buy 10.74 francs
yesterday, compared with 5.18 normally,
marking the lowest value yet attained
by French currency. For the first time
the dollar become worth slightly in ex?
cess of 10 Belgian francs toward the
close of the week, and lire, marks and
kronen also turned lower.
With the announcement of Secretary
Glass that the future financing of
Europe's purchases here would have
to be provided through private initia?
tive, a leading international banker
estimated that $500,000,000 of credits
would have to be arranged to tide
Europe over the winter. This sum, it
was explained, would merely keep the
wolf from the door, and would bo far
less than needed comprehensively to
meet the situation.
President Wilson, in his message to
Congress, recognized the need of aid?
ing Europe financially, but fugKosted
no plan. He merely emphasized the
neetl of encouraging imports, so that
eventually Europe can pay for poods
with goods. He, therefore, urp-ed the
adjustment of the tariff in such a way
as not to discourage imports.
If you calculate the cost of the dol?
lar in terms of foreign money at cur?
rent exchange value, that is, if you
were buying dollars with pounds,
marks or francs, its valuo at the close
of last week, as compared with a year
ago, follows:

In Wall Street
"What Do You Think of the Market?"
A bank officer: "It would be rash to
assume that because of the moderate
improvement in security prices this
week the way ia open to a resumption
of wild speculation. Tho market was
due for something of a rebound from
the decline. Personally, I don't think
it will move very far either up or down
for some weeks. As to next year, it
would be foolish to try to predict what
tho course of prices will be. It must
bo kept in mind, however, that prop?
erty values back of stocka are much
greater than ever before."
Sugars Lead
Professional traders concentrated
their efforts on the sugar stocks yes?
terday, and that accounted in large
measure for the shifting of interest
from the oils into that group. Cuba
Cane Sugar common was easily the big
show in the short session. When it
crossed 52 it got the nearest it has in
a long while to the levels at which
many folks loaded up with the common
early in the life of the concern. Buy?
ing of the stock came largely from so
called "insiders," the Street heard, and
was based on the sensational rise in
the price of raw sugar in Cuba. A
week or so ago raw Cuban sugar was
selling around 7 cents a pound f. o. b.
the island. To-day it is 10% cents a
pound f. o. b. Cuba for delivery from
December 15 to 31, "'Vi cents for Jan?
uary delivery and b oenta delivery in
the first half of February.
Raw Sugar Soaring
With sugar control going by the
board everything points to one of the
wildest scrambles for Cuban raws in
years. England and Continental Eu?
rope are bidding high for the Cuban
crop and American refiners have up to
recently been unwilling to do anything
because they expected another year of
control. But with the' news that the
restrictions are to go off, competitive
bidding has begun, and the Cuban
sugar producers are getting the benefit.
This is the situation which is being
discounted by the rise in the shares of
these companies. England is one of
the largest buyers of Cuban sugar at
present and her purchases are expected
to run close to the total of 1916. when
she took in excess of 600,000 ton3.
Prior to that time England had been a
small factor in the Cuban market since
most of the English demand was filled
with beet *ugar bought on the Conti?
nent. The rise in Cuban raws is help?
ing the American beet sugar producers
As indicative of the shortage of sweets
in this part of the country beet sugar
is beginning to appear east of the Mis?
sissippi.
A Lively Corpse
"The bull market may be dead," said
a commission house trader yesterday,
"but it certainly is a lively corpse."
The Coppers
Copper stocks are not attnetive be?
cause of the general knowledge of the
slack market for the metal and the un?
favorable position of the producing
companies arising from the enormous
accumulation of supplies. Copper re?
fined and in process is put at 1,200,000,
000 pound.-?. That is a huge load to
carry. It has piled up despite curtail?
ment of production on all sules. But
the question that arises in this con?
nection is whether or not the copper
stocks have discounted this condition
of affairs Copper stocks are selling
in the market way out of line with
other industrials; in fact under pre?
war prices in many cases. Many brok?
ers insist that with patience holders
of such stocks will be well rewarded
as the demand for copper metal is
bound to pick up in time and clean up
the big surplus. Even assuming that
the companies should all close down
for a period the property values re?
main, particularly the enormous ore
reserves which aH the progressive
producers have been steadily develop?
ing from year to year.
A Professional Opinion
Speaking of the copper stocks, a
! Broadway Stock Exchange house has
i this to say: "If over-expanded credits
; aro not followed by general liquida
1 tion, it will be something new in tho
world's history, and the attractiveness
of coppers, which is for the long pull
rather than for the moment, is that
thhaei*" liquidation ha* already gone
very far toward completion. Even the
question of dividends is perhaps less
important to the patient than tho fact
that copper shares always come back.
They are bound to do so because cop?
per is one of the chief materials of in?
dustrial expansion. While we see no
promise of immediate speculative
profits in these stocks, we believe that
they are cheaper than the majority of
other industrials, that from the pres?
ent time until the general over-expan?
sion of credit is corrected they will
decline less both in points and per?
centages."
A New Oil Rail
It's a rare day Indeed when Wall
Street does not uncover a new oil
prospect. Yesterday Northern Pacific
was nut in the class of the oil rails.
Information "which cannot be guaran?
teed, but which is obtained from
sources believed to be reliable" indi- !
cates that the road has a small well on !
its property which is producing oil. St. I
Paul recently went into this class.
Salt Water
Wall Street's little group of amateur ;
geologists had something to bite on I
yesterday when one of the news tickers
printed a story to the effect that the j
Mexican Petroleum's Juan Casiano No. i
7 gusher, that has spouted 100.000.?00
barrels of oil since it was brought in :
in 1910, is running 3 per cent salt
water. Not long ago one of the Mex?
ican Eagle wells completely stopped
gushing petroleum and went to produc?
ing salt water. The comment around
the street with regard to the Casiano
No. 7 was that it had done pretty well
in its life of nearly ten years, and had
earned a pension. What the oil geolo?
gists have been worrying about with
regard to the Mexican fields is the pos?
sibility that all of the big producers
there might eventually go to salt water.
The theory is held by some geologists
that the oil pools there float on salt
water, and with the exhaustion of the
petroleum supply in a given area the
salt water begins to come up. It is
stated that Mexican Petroleum's Cerro
Azul No. 4 well, the biggest in the
world, which started with an initial
flow of 275,000 barrels a day, has
shown no signs of salt water.
German Exchange as a Speculation
Is mark exchange a cheap specula?
tion? A lot of people who are willing
to take a chance would like to know.
In fact, there has been and still is
considerable speculation in exchange on
Berlin. Marks at 2V? cents apiece look
to be on the bargain counter when they
are compared with their normal gold
parity of 23.9 cents. But bankers will
say that the risk involved in the pur?
chase of marks for speculation is great,
because there is a strong possibility
thai in ue course of time the new r??
gime in Germany will cancel the war?
time paper money and put out new cur?
rency based on a different gold value
for the mark.
A Banker's View
Leopold Zimmermann, head of the
banking house of Zimmermann & For
shay, which has important German af?
filiation?, does not think there is much
prospect of the issuance of new money
in Germany to replace the depreciated '
war paper. He was in Germany ser- j

Stock Dividend Possibilities
Many traders in the Street have the
habt of taking on at the end of eatjr
week industrial stocks which are likely;
to be benefited by a favorable ?eds'on?
by the Supreme Court relative :o the?
taxability of stock dividends. The idea,
is to hold them until ?mer midday
Monday, by which time the decision!
of the court have been handed down.
When the ?leci^ion ?loes not corte down
they sell out and wait for the follow?
ing week end. Tho list of stocks which
would be helped by such a decision is
long. It includes American Sugar, In?
ternational Harvester, Kelly Spring?
