"I think it safe to say that we'll set the
fiew club organized on Mondaj" were tbe
words of Manager Hanlon last evening, nt
the close of the meeting of the local 1. L.
stockholders. The meeting was held at the
Hotel Duquesne, and lasted about two
nonrs, and although every detail was not
definitely settled, the business transacted
warranted the assuring statement of Mr.
Hanlon.
Director H. B. Ilea was also extremely
cheerful at the prospect, and said: "Every
thing is in first-class shape. There are two
stockholders yet to hejr from, Fred Carroll
and one in the East. The latter, however,
is willing to forfeit his stoct it he does not
pay the 30 per cent assessment. However,
we are all right."
According to the opinion of the stock
holders last evening no more meetings of
the P. L. stockholders will be necessary,
and the next meeting will be to organize the
new club. At last evening's meeting the
plan of dissolution sgreed to was for each
stockholder to pay his share of the club's
debts. This most assuredly is the best way,
and one that will be in the long run the
most harmonious. At any r.ite, it is less
cnen to objections than any other. Satis
factory arrangements will, at once, be made
with tfce creditors and, as Manager Hanlon
sid, the new club may be formed on
Monday.
Both parties are anxious to have the new
club organized so that definite and safe
action can be taken in the way of signing
new plavers. Mr. Hanlon is exceedingly
anxious on this point, as it is probable that
after Monday clubs can commence signing
players. On Mond.iv the Conference Com
mittee is expected to meet in New York,
and that body bus the power to tay that
everything between the X. L. and 1. L is
settled or declared off. In either event it is
likely that permission will be given to
clubs to sign player. In anticipation oi
this Mr. Hanlon desires that the Pittsburg
club be in a position to be in the field as
soon as anybody eise.
Of course, Mt. Hanlon is not yet elected
manager, hut jt is certain that he will be,
jadgiug from the general opinions of
stocuholders. Mr. O'Xeill will be elected
President of the club. The experiences
gone through of ljtc will certainly cause
lany man appointed to the office tobe very
cautious and fair to everybodv concerned.
The debts of the P. iu club amount lo
59.G90, and ah of this amount, except ?G00,
is due one gentleman. He is interested in
the club and has made very gcneious terms
tif payment.

A writer in the Ct Icigo Herald thus refers
to F. H. Urunell: 'Trauk 11. Branell. ex
Bcerctary of the late I'lavers' League, has fur
nished a Philadelphia baseball paper to
columns of his patent inside, manifolded.-pacc-pa:cl
matter, in hic!i he gives hit own ersion
of the manner in uuich he lost a job. All
through the latter appear tiacesof the froth
exuded from the muu:li of the venomous little
.ex-secietary. from whose over-ofhciousncss
and prolific distribution of typewritten mis
statements las: spring sprouted the deadly
weed that contaminated the baseball garden.
lu closing his stereot :ed weekly bluster the
untitled baseball attache gies the lie to the
Jfi-alil for asserting that tue Plaj crs' League
tifticiaU here were cwcied lor non-paju-cnt of
ofiice rent.
In pursuance of his long-established custom
Urunell calls hanl names, leans awav back in
IliS chair, blinks through bis ejeglas-cs and ex
pects the puliht, upon nlmm he has inflicted
to many fa'se-proicd assertions, to belice
him again. The He aid's story was true, its
source of miiirmatioii being the landlords
from whom Ilruncll rented his office, and to
whom tie still ors the money as claimed.
Jcnncv & Graiiam did order the truck left in
the office thro .n inti tho hall, and did claim
the wooden partitions and two office desks as
security. Ihet ma-piritor lu.isruanmuti thev
allowed the ei-becrntart to Mnp hi desk to
.Cleveland. In his letter ltrunell tells how
.much lucuicj is o in:: to toe bill players by
each club, and li much he, as Lcanuo treas
urer, did not im in tfullalo rnd Cincinnati.
At the same time ho fails tn teil tha hcpaid
Ins ou n salan pmmpilj. and that an office
favorite, ".alary unpaid, ., is allowed to di -pose
of 14,000 copies of unsold guides in order
that he might noi lie forced to walk to liitMi
Boari home. Everborty connected with the
tlelunct Players' League has suffered in pocket
excent ltrunell. who, as Ticasurer. looked out
iforlun s;lf. Having larccl a-sistcd in punc
ttiring the baseball bubble, lie continue? in his
attempts to profit on the credulity of patrons
if the sport lij dissecting the corpse, and hold
ing up to public vi"w each nruiseu and tainted
limit. The Mine nulilic has sickened of the

THE SEVERE CENSURE
Of Minister Mizner for His Part in
the ISarriiiidia. Killing
GIVEN HIM-BT SECKfiTARI BLAINE.
Official Uorrerpondence of the Cass Sent to
Congress.
NO EXCDSli FOE THE MISISTEU
Washington, Dec. 5. The President
to-day, transmitted to the House oE Repre
sentatives the correspondence growing out
of the killing of General Barrundia by
Guatemalan officers on board the Pacific
Mail steamer Acapulco in the port of San
Jose. The correspondence was called for by
resolution of September 21 last, declaring
that Mr. Blair,?, in his letter laying the cor
respondence te'ore the President, says: "It
will be observed the last report of Minister
Mizner contains matter essential to a full
and accurate understanding of the case,"
and was dated September 23, and not re
ceived at the department until October 9,
several days after th: adjournment of Con
gress. The correspondence consists often in
cisures, the first of which was a telegram
from Mr. Mizner to Mr. Blaine, dated
August 28, and the last a letter from Mr.
Blaine to Minister Mizner, dated Novem
ber 18,aunouncing that he can see no justifi
cation of Mr. Mizner's course, that this
Government disavows his action, and di
recting him to turn over the attain of the
legation to Mr. ICimberly and return to the
United States.
Mizner's Side of It.
In his telegram announcing General Bar
ruudia's death, Mr. Mizuer says he had ad
vised the steamship officers that be
guaranteed General iJarrundia's personal
safety, and that he had joined the United
States Consul General in advising the
Captain to permit the arrest, on the charge
of being an enemy, martial law being in
forge. Under the date of August 30, Act
ing Secretary Wharton telegraphed Mizner
regretting that he (the Miuister), had ad
vised or consented to the surrender, as no
specific charge of violation of the ordinary
lawot Guatamala appeared.
Minister Minner's first letter to Secretary
Blaine with regard to the killing is dated
August 29, and was received September 18.
He relates the circumstances already stated
and then quotes a communication to Cap
tain Pitts.dated the lilth, stating that Guata
mala, like any other nation, has the right
to arrest a peison on a neutral ship in its
waters in time of war for any cause deemed
an offense under international law.
The Order to Captain Pitts.
In a later telegram to Captain Pitts, Min
ister Mizner says:
If your ship is' within one league of the terri
tory of Qnatamala and you have on board Gen
eral Barrundia it becomes your duty under the
law of nations to deliver him to the authorities
of Guatamala upon their demand. Allegations
lutving been made to this legation that Bar
rundia is hostile to, and an enemy to this He
public, guarantres have been made to me by
this Government that bis life shall not be in
danger or any o';her punishment inflicted upon
him other than for the causes charged.
The allusions to Barrundia' personal
salety, Mr. Mizner says, were at his request
promised the night before by the President.
Subsequently he received a telegram from
Commander Keiter, ot the navy, acknowl
edging Guatamala's right over the steamer,
and requesting the Minister to obtain per
mission irom the Government to return Bar
rundia to Mexico in the Thetis. The Minis
ter of Foreign Relations positively declined
to accede to this, request.
All the circumstances and Barrundia's
well-kown hostility to the republic, aud his
attempted invasion of Mexico,. Mr,
Mizner says, decided his course, and hene-J
cordingly, in response to a request for writ
ten and not telegraphic orders, sent Captain
Pitts a letter advising the Captain to sub
mit to tbe arreat of bis passenger. The fol
lowing day Commander Keiter telegraphed
Barrundia's death while resisting arrest.
Guatemala Beady to Fight.
Under date of September 23, iu a letter
from Mr. Mizner to Mr. Blaine, which was
received October 9, and in which the Minis
ter justified his course, he says he called on
the 18th ou the Minister ot Foreign Rela
tions .or an explanation of the affair. Iu
this interview the Minister stated with em
phasis that his Government had given posi
tive orders to take Barrundia from the
Acapulco even to sinking the ship, notwith
standing it might have involved a conflict
with our two war vessels.
This, he said, would have been in the ex
ercise of the undoubted right of his Govern
ment over its own waters, in which he was
confident the law of nations would hive
sustained him. Mr. Mizuer says he had
never heard of these orders before. He
then gives the decision of Secretary Bayard
in the Gomez, Mexican, case in support of
his action, and concludes: "I confidently
add that nothing will tend so much to the
establishment of a permanent peace in these
republics as a plain declaration that our
fleet ot steamers cannot be used in local.
waters as an asylum for revolutionists.
Blaino Censures the Minister.
The correspondence closes with a letter
from Secretary Blaine, to Mr. Mizner, dated
November 18th, in which he reviews the
case at length iu all its bearings, and says
that "the more the question is examined in
the light of important facts, tardily dis
closed, the deeper becomes the regret that
you so far exceeded your legitimate author
ity as to sign the paper, which in the hands
of the officers of Guatemala became their
warrant for the capture of General Barrun
dia." The Secretary contends that the claim
that the Government of Guatemala had ihe
right to arrest B irrundta under its con
tract with the Pacific Mail Steamship Com
pany is untenable, and attacks each of
the specific demands of Guatemala upon
the representatives of the United States" in
this case as improper and illegal.
The case of Gomez, which Mizner offers as
an excuse for his conduct, the Secretary dis
cusses at length and fails to find in it any
support of Mizner's action.
Secretary Blaine then continues:
Mizner Wholly to Blame.
I am aware that it may be said that after all
you merely advisod the Captain of his duty.
lJut the Captain did not simply seek advice.
In his telegram from Champcrico, be sass that
op his arrival at Sau Jose he will place himself
"under tbe orders of the American Minister."
He again telegraphed to you later from Chaui
jicricn that he was "awaiting yunr instruc
tions," anil that at San Jose he expected "your
written orders." In his last telegram to you.
dispatphed from San Jose on arriving at that
port on the evening of August 27, he cate
gorically inquires: Shall I deliver General
Barrundia to the authorities here7 If so,
please send me a letter with yoursignature to
that efTect."
There is not hero the slightest suggestion
that Captain Pitts proposed to act otherwise
than by your orders, and under your lesponsi
Uility. It was under these circumstances that
you wrote the letter which became, lu tbe hands
if a Guatemalan official, the pretext of the at
tempted seizure of General Barrundia.
The naval force of the United States in those
waters thus became an acquiescent spectator
of events, although a merchant vessel or the
United States was then lying under the muzzles
of guns manned by men who, as you state, you
hart every reason to believe wero prepared to
resort to any act of violence, even," as Scnor
Anguiano has Blnce declared to you, "to sink
the ship, notwithstanding it might' have iu.
volved a conflict with our two vjar vessels then
and there."
Little Begard for Threats.
I am not disposed to pay undue regard to
these post facto threats, which" are now re
ported to the department, I prefer to think
that by extravagance of language, Uncontrolled
by tbe actual presence of the problem which
he was permitted to solve so much tn his
satisfaction, Benor Anguiano has done this in
justice to his own sense nf humanity. To have
sunk the Acapulco, with her freight of
Innocent lives. In the execution of a purpose
for tbe accomplishment of which nothing but
unlawful and Invalid excuses have so far been
advanced, would have been an act of warfare,
and of savage warfare. .
Ana I am instructed by the President to say
that he earnestly trusts the time will never
come when the course of events in Guatamala
or tbe declared purpose of her rulers will con
strain this Government to insure the safety of
its merchant vessels entering the waters of
Guatamala, by stationing naval vessels along
the coast and oppostte, the ports of that
country.
Secretary Blaine informs Mr. Mizner that
if. instead of accepting the lawless and tur
bulent condition of affairs as the ground of
his advice and consent to the surrender
of General -Barrundia, he had made it the
basis of a suggestion to Commander Keiter
to offer him hospitality on board of the
Ranger, witnin or without the waters of
Guatamala, and with or without the conseut
of her government, his action would have
bad the sanction of humane and recognized
precedence.
Invited to Come Home.
Mr. Blaine closes his letter as follows:
On more than one occasion this Government
has permitted its legations and ships ot war to
offer hospitality to political refugees. This
is done from motives of human
ity. Its views would not have
been less pronounced if, in addition to
tho humane aspect of tho subject, it had also
been confronted with tbo duty of preventing
tbe decks of its merchant vessels from being
made the theater of illegal violence, upon
groundless and unlawful excuses, and without
even tho pretense of legal formality.
For your course, therefore. In intervening to
permit the authorities of Guatamala to ac
complish their desire to capture Gen
eral Barrundia, I can discover no justifica
tion. You were promptly informed that your
act was regretted. I am now directed by the
President to inform you that It is disavowed,
Tho President is moreover, of opinion that
your usefulness in Central America is at an
end.
You will therefore leave vour post with all
convenient dispatch, turning over your lega
tion to Mr. Kimberly as charge d'affaires ad in
teritn, through whom your letter of recall will
subsequently be presented the Gautcraalan
Government.
ADAM AMNION DEAD,
The Well-Known Allegheny Conncilman
Dies Suddenly on a Pullman Sleeping
Car TVliile Betnrning From Bochester,
N. T. Heart Failure the Cause.
Councilman Adam Amnion, of the Fifth
ward, Allegheny, died suddenly yesterday
morning while" on
the Buffalo ex
press of tbe Pitts
burg and Lake
Erie Railroad. His
death was entirely
unexpected, as he
had been in robust
lieal th for a man of
his age.
Mr. Ammon was
a member of the
firm of Hamilton,
Ammon & Arnold,
dealers in undertakers supplies. Together
with Mr. Arnold he went to Jtochester, K.
Y., on "Wednesday, and on Thursday
night he started for home. He took
a sleeper, and when near Ashta
bula, about 10 o'clock, called the porter
and told him that, as he was not feeling
well, he preferred not to have his berth ar
ranged. "When tbetrain reached Coraopolis
thp porter started to awaken the passenger,
but Mr. Amnion did not respond. The con
ductor was called and he was found to be
dead. Tbe body was removed to a rear com
partment and friends in Allegheny were
notified.
When the train reached this city "William
P. Bennett, a son-in-law of the dead man,
was at the station, and the body was re
moved to the family residence. No. 121 Shef
field street.
Mr. Ammon was born in "Washington
county Go years ago, and early started in
the nursery business at Mt. Lebanon. He
removed to Allegheny about 40 years ago,
and in the latter part of the sixties hecame
a member of the firm with which he was
connected at the time of his death. In 18S1
he was elected to Common Council from the
Fifth ward. He was Chairman of the City
Property Committee and also a member of
the committees on Wharves and Landings,
Fire, Street Railroads- and Library. Mr.
Amnion was married twice, and leaves a
wife' and daughter.
TWO STAFF PLACES TO FILL.
A Conple of Appointments Yet to be Made
by tho New Governor.
The meetingaif the Grand Lodge of Masons
in Philadelphia during the week, developed
the strength of the number of military appli
cants for positions nn the new Governor's,
staff. This brigade was represented by four
applicants for the commission of the present
Adjutant General, whoae record was made
during tbe terrible calamity that overtook
Johnstown. The political aud military
records of those candidates have been set
aside iu the interest of a Pittsburg
L'entleman. whose merits as a citizen and a
soldier are indorsed by representatives of
both parties in this city. Tne expected ap
pointment of this gentleman has set at rest
the claims of all the other candidates, and
they are now returning to their several
walks in life.
Two appointments arc yet to be filled by
the Governor-elect. The most important,
next to the Adjutant General, are
the Inspector General aud Quarter
master General. These positions re
quire that tbe incumbents be fitted
with brains and ability, to honorably fill the
offices, years of experience in the Guard
is one of the first requirements, and Cham
bers MrKibben, an ex-Colonel of the Eight
eenth Regiment, and whose appointment is
considered sure, has all the requirements.
For Quartermaster General, Major V. W.
Grceulaud, of the Second Brigade, and a
resident of Clarion county, is now men
tioned. He has had long experience in the
Quartermaster's department of the brigade,
and his indorsement will soon be in course
of preparation in this brigade.
