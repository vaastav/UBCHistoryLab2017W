State Senator Page Spent
Thirty Minutes With President
IS CLOSER TO GOVERNOR
Than Any Other Man in the State
of New York.
WHITE HOUSE AND ALBANY
Effort to Bring Them Closer to Each
Other in Political Affairs.
Hughes' Friends Working.
8tate Senator Alfred R. Page, who
stands closer to Gov. Hughes than any
other man in New York, spent thirty
minutes with President Roosevelt today,
and his presence immediately led to
stories that the interview was for the
put-pose of bringing the White House and
Albany closer to each other In political
affairs. That they have been far apart
and that some bltt<-rneps has been mani
fested is thoroughly well known. That
sooner or later attempts will be made
to lessen the feeling and bring the two
men together is not doubted. That the
first break In that direction may have
been made today is surmised, although
Senator Page distinctly disclaimed that
he was in the city representing Gov.
Hughes in any capacity. He came here
on legal business In the Supreme Court,
he said, and he simply desired to pay
his respects to the President, with whom
he had worked politically way back in the
days when Senator Edmunds was seeking
the republican nomination for'President.
Talking of Former Times.
"We talked over those days," said the
state senator; but when asked whether
the talk had been brought down to date
he smiled and said there was little of
current date discussed.
"A great deal of this talk about antag
onism between the President and Gov.
Hughes has been brought about by indis
creet friends of each, but it does not
exist," he said, "and it will disappear as
matters go on. Yes; Gov. Hughes' friends
propose to make him the republican nomi
nee next year and they believe they have
a splendid opportunity. What work are
they doing and will they do? Well. Just
watch the dust spots in the distance and
you will see where they are moving. Will
there be a soliu delegation for him from
New York? I have no doubt he will re
ceive the full vote of the state. It is not
our custom to Instruct delegates, although
if the people are bent on that they will
probably do it. It was once decided that
a state convention has no authority to in
struct vhe delegates of congressional con
ventions, by which most New York dele
gates in elected. Will Gov. Hughes' is
sue a statement, announcing his condl
dacy?
Friends Going Bight Along.
"I do not know what he will do. but his
friends are going Bight along without an
announcement. Hpw does he stand on
the tariff and othfcr matters? He wilt
|*[llllis tfr'i'f known Ih his letter of accept

to Gov. fluffs should he find that Sec
retary TaTffTannot/ be nominated? That I
d" not k*iow\ but (1 see no reason why he
should oi.t ti) so.; 1 think he will come
to the {ftnciafclon that Gov. Hughes comes
the'right man as any other
an Ami."
Senator Page admitted that he will re
tu^ to Washington before a great while,
? ndaliere areji|l*9*Sfons that the confer

frlen^p of Hughes will be renewed and

? urkett Resolution Not Taken Up
by Senate Committee.
The Senate committee on the District
*' Columbia did not meet today to con
jider Senator Burkett's resolution calling
for the suspennion of the Chancellor case
before the board of education. Senator
Ualtlnger. chairman of the committee, re
ceived no calls from persons Interested
in school affairs.
So far as can be learned Senator Burkett
has not yet asked Senator Gallinger to
call a meeting of the committee for Mon
day morning to take up this matter, and
from the present outlook it is not likely
that a meeting will be held at that time.

Tragedy Happened Off the Scilly
Isles Last Night.
HISTORY OF THE BIG SCHOONER
She Was in a Class by Herself?Had
Been a Great Money-Maker.
No Insurance.
[ Special Cablegram to The Star.
I LONDON, December 14.?The schooner
Thomas W. Lawson. Capt. Dow, which
j called from Philadelphia for London No
vember 15. ran on the rocks of the Scil
ly Islands last evening in a gale. As
| sistance was sent to her, but her lights
disappeared early In the morning, and
[ she is now lying on the rocks bottom up
| ward. Three dead bodies have been
washed ashore on St. Agnes Island and
[ one r-an was rescued unconscious. The
Thomas W. Lawson was a vessel of
4.914 tons.
Three dead bodies have been found off
Annett Island, an uninhabited islet of the
Scilly group. The soio survivor, who has
been landed at St. Apnea by the St. Agnes
lifeboat, is only partly conscious at this
writing.
Signals of distress were heard at the
Bishop Rock lighthouse at 4 o'clock yes
terday afternoon. Two lifeboats at once
put out and found the Thomas W. law
son anchored in a dangerous position just
north of Gunners' Rock. Great seas were
running, and the lifeboats, although they
stood by for several hours, were unable to
render assistance.
Alone in the Qale.
At the request of the captain of the
Lawson the St. Mary's lifeboat, the masts
of which had been broken ofT in attempt
ing to rescue the crew of the schooner,
put back with the purpose of telegraph
ing for a tug to come to the assistance
of the Lawson. The St. Agnes lifeboat
was left standing by. A little later, how
ever, this lifeboat had to leave, as one of
Its crew was dying of exposure, while the
others were almost completely exhausted.
At about ten minutes before 3 o'clock
this morning the lookouts at the St. Agnes
and Bishop Rock lighthouse and the
coast guards missed the lights of Ihe
Lawson at the same time, and when a
lifeboat returned to the scene oil float
ing on the waves Indicated disaster. A
few minutes later the lifeboat,crew found
the Lawson bottom up.
Search for Survivors.
Searching the vicinity the St. Agnes
lifeboat picked up the solitary survivor,
a man wimeil Green, and found three
dead bodies off Annett Island. The sur
vivor and the dead were brought back to
St. Agnes.
The gale is still blowing fiercely and
the seas are running high. A doctor from
St. Mary's has gone out in a lifeboat to
render assistance to other possible sur
vivors.
Among the drowned is W. C. Hicks, a
Scilly pilot, who managed to scramble
on board the Lawson during one of the
attempts of the St. Agnes lifeboat to
help the il'-fated ship.
All Probably Lost.
The search up to noon failed to discover
any further survivors, and it now seems
to be established that Allen is the only
member of the crew who did not lose his
life. The number of drowned is said to be
eighteen. Allen was* seriously injured
and the doctor in attendance is doubtful
if he will live out the day.
From scraps of information that have
been obtained from the semi-conscious
man it seems that the Thomas W. Law
son encountered prolonged bad weather
and lost all her boats on the trip out from
Philadelphia. She sighted the Scilly
Islands yesterday afternoon, and finding
herself in a dangerous position dropped
both anchors, the captain hoping that
the weather would moderate. The cap
tain thought it wise to send back one of
the lifeboats that came out to secure the
assistance of a steam tug. The St. Agnes
lifeboat continued to stand by the strain
ing schooner until the exhausted condition
of its crew made it absolutely necessary
to seek the shelter of a harbor.
At midnight the wind rose to hurricane
force and the vessel battered by the
waves finally turned over.
Allen says that when he last saw them j
the captain and mate of the Lawson and
the pilot were lashed to the rigging.
Another Sailor Saved.
Another sailor from the Thomas W.
Lawson has been picked up alive by St.
Agnes boatmen.
Carried a Fortune in Oil.
PHILADELPHIA. December 14.-The

masted schooner Thomas W. Lawson at
the Scilly Islands was received her to
i day with much sorrow. The Lawson clfear

,'how she was built
NEVER ANOTHER VESSEL LIKE
HER LAUNCHED.
NEW YORK. December 14.?The Thom
as \V. Lawson. which was wrecked in
Broad sound last night, was the largest
schooner and the only seven-master afloat.
! When launched at Quincy, Mass., five
years ago the lawson had a divided fol
lowing. By many she was looked upon
as the beginning of almost a new era in
American shipbuilding. By others she was
regarded as a monumental error, doomed
to certain failure. Time proved that
neither of these prophecies was correct.
No other seven-master has been built and
the Lawson has continued through her
whole life to be in a class by herself, but
she was by no means a failure from a
financial point of view. Her tremendous
carrying capacity resulted In making her
a most profitable investment for her own
ers. At the time of the acciden' which
ended dier career she was under charter,
which brought her owners a return of
$78,<>00 a year. She was valued at $300,UOO.
Carried Eighteen Ken.
The Lawson was designed by B. B.
Crownlnshleld of Boston, was built "by the
Fore Biver Shipbuilding Company and a
little later came into the possession of the
Coastwise Transportation Company. It
was the transportation company which
chartered the I,awson to the Sun Oil
Company for a period of five years. She
was in tthe oil company's service on the
present voyage, which began at Philadel
phia November 19. .-V
The Thomas W Lawson was 403 feet >n
length and the great boom of the after
most sail and the spike steer bowsprit, &?
feet long, made her measure nearly .TOO
feet from tip to tip. With a beam of 50
feet and a depth of 34 feet .1 inches she
had a cargo capacity of 8,100 tons. Her
displacement tvhen loaded was 11,000 tons,
the road draught being ittS'/fc feet. She was
lighted by electricity, steered by steam,
heated by steam, and her sails were raised
and lowered by power furnished by half a
dozen stationary engines. She was com
manded by Capt. George W. Dow of Mel
rose, Mass., and carried a crew of eight
een men. She was not insured.
It is a peculiar coincidence that the big
seven-master went to her end last night
Friday. the 13th?inasmuch as that was
the title of a book written by Thomas W.
Lawson.
England Is Storm-Swept.
Special Cablegram to The Star.
I.OXDON, December 14.?A tremendous
hurricane Is sweeping western Europe to
day. There has been much damage to
shipping along the English coast. All the
lifeboats and tugs are busy assisting
wrecks and bringing in disabled vessels.
A naval cutter has foundered off Sheer
ness and eight men were drowned.
Extensive damage has been done in
land, especially in London, where the
full force of the g&le was felt. Win
dows of shops were blown . in, houses
were unroofed and chimneys and hoard
ings were demolished.
The continuous rain caused floods in
the Thames valley in many districts, the
lands adjacent to the river being sub
merged and houses being threatened with
destruction.
AGAINST GRAIN FUTURES.
Burlesson's Bill Stirs Up the Chicago
Board of Trade.
Spwlal Dispatch tofThe Star.
CHICAGO, December 14.?Board of trade
men were much excited today by reposes
from Washington that a bill recently in
troduced by Representative Burleson
making it illegal to trade In futures, either
grain or cotton, was likely to become a
law.
It was said that the bill, which is said
to be similar to the stringent anti-option
trading laws passed by some of the south
ern states, has been promised the sup
port of a majority of members of the
House and that assurances had been made
tliat the Senate would pass the measure.
According to the synopsis of the fc.ll re
ceived ihere. if passed it would legislate
out of business a large proportion of the
firms carrying on speculative operations
on the Chicago oBard of Trade, as well as
other grain ar... cotton exchanges.
"A meeting of the directors will be
called to take action in respect to the pro
posed act." said President Sager of the
board of trade. "The directors will un
questionably take steps to defeat the
measure."
The bill makes it illegal to deal in con
tracts for the delivery of cotton, grain
and other commodities until the party sell
ing the contract has made provision for
obtaining the actual grain. An affidavit is
required stating that such Is t>he case to
make It pass muster.

A band of sixty robbers attacked and de

The train was carrying a large sum of
money. The train guard repulsed the ban

STORM STRUCK CHICAGO.
Heaviest Fall of Snow in Years)
Traffic Impeded.
Social Dispatch to The Star.
CHICAGO. December 14.?The biggest
storm known in Chicago in years struck
the city today, tying up the transporta
tion facilities of every sort, surface and
elevated, and forcing thousands of men
and women to walk to work. The snow,
blown across the tricks in deep drifts,
blocked all electric and steam roads. Snow
plows were used by the traction compa
nies in an effort to clear their tracks,
but the rapidity with which the snow fell
and drifted made it necessary to go over
the lines several times before the tracks
could be cleared.
Accidents were reported at a number
of places, caused mostly by slippery side
walks. Calls for ambulances were receiv
ed at nearly every police station in the
city.
The snow fall was the heaviest for this
time of the season that has been re
corded in years.
WHY SHE KILLED HUSBAND.
"
Mrs. Edmonia Peebles Says She Did
It to Save Herself.
i I.Y XCHBL'RG, Va? December 14.?The
e\ idence of Mrs. Ed-njonia Peebles, charg
ed with the murderTier husband last
August, occupied the court at Bedford
City most of yesterday. She nia/Ie a dra
matic recital and wept frequently.
She claimed she killed her husband in a
hand-to-hand conflict while he was at
tacking her with an ax handle. He
wrenched the gun from her after she had
shot him twice, and. fearing he would re
load it and kill her. she beat his head
with rocks until he was dead.
Claiming the body weighed i!00 pounds,
she and her two small children were un
able to move it. so they hitched a horse
to it and dragged it to the yard, covered
it up and watched it all night. The next
day after her household work was over
she sent for a magistrate and was ar
rested that night. She swore Peebles de
clared he would "murder" her, and that
she killed him to save herself.
Peebles had just returned from a trip
to Lynchburg in a drunken condition
when the tight occurred. The case may
be concluded today.

American Bark Edmund Phin
ney Ashore in Storm.
BRAVE ATTEMPT AT RESCUE
Furious Gale Foils the Work of the
Lifesavers.
WIND DRIVES BACK STEAM TUG
Ten or Twelve Men Have Been Seen
in the Rigging of the Vessel,
Which Is Close in Shore.
Special Dispatch to The Star.
NEW YORK, December 14.?The Ameri
can bark Edmund Phlnney went ashore
off Sandy Hook In a storm this morning.
The lifesavers sighted her about 9
o'clock flying her flag, union down. In the
mizzen rigging. |
The crew of llfesavir.g station No. at 1
Spermacetti Cove, started up the beach at
10 o'clock to lend assistance with the
beach apparatus In case the men from
Sandy Hook station should fall to reach
the vessel.
It was blowing a gale from the north
east, with rain, high sea and surf.
The Edmund Phinney Is a bark of 656
tons register. Her captain's name Is An
derson.
Men Seen From Shore.
Tlie lifesavers made several unsuccess
ful attempts to shoot the life line to the
bark, but owing to the gale the Dyle
gun would not throw the line as far as
the wrecked vessel. Two tugs tried to
"each the bark, but failed and the life
savers then tried to reach the vessel in
their power lifeboat.
Ten or twelve men were in the rigging
of the Phinney watching the efforts of
the life-savers.
The task of saving tlie lives of the crew
or the Phinney was extremely ha*ardous,
owing to the blinding: snowstorm and ter
rifle seas which were breaking on tlie
beach. It was impossible for the life
savers to launch a boat through such a
sea. and they prepared at once to shoot a
life-line over the bark and bring the crew
ashore in a breeches buoy. As the bark
lay only about loo feet from the beach,
there was* a good chance of saving the
sailors in that way.
Tug Driven to Shelter.
Again a wrecking tug towing a lifeboat
was compelled by the heavy seas to turn
back before reaching the sr^ne of *he
wreck. The two craft returned to the
shelter of the Hook. The wind was then
blowing sixty miles an hour, and the
snow had turned to rain.
May Save the Crew.
1 tie Merritt-Chapman wrecking crew
went ashore when it was found that their
tug could not reach the Phinney. They
volunteered to assist the life savers and
their offer was accepted. Shortly before
2 o'clock a line was sent out and reached
the Phinney, and it was hoped then that
:ili of the crow would be rescued. The
bark is breaking up very fast. The life
savers are now bringing the crew of the
Phinney ashore- in the breeches buoy.
A three-masted schooner previously re
ported ashore is still In deep water at
anchor. So long as her anchors hold she
is safe. Her name cannot be made out
from shore.
BLENDS SOLD AS WHISKY.
Revenue Officials Ordered to Enforce
Pure Food Law.
It having been demonstrated to the
President that blended whisky is still be
ing sold under revenue stamps as whisky,
he l^s directed the internal revenue of
ficials to enforce immediately the ruling
made last spring by the Attorney General
on the subject of straight, blended and
compound whiskies.
It is asserted that the guarantee under'
which the blends are sold Is not in con
formity with the provisions of the pure
food law. If this be true, the Treasury
regulations will be altered and the rec
tifiers' stamp will be so chahgt-d that its
wording will show precisely the cha ac
ter of the "blend" or the "compound."
The importance of this action lies in the
fact that tlie revenue offic.als have
ignored the ruling of tlie legal officer of
the government, and that the change has
only beon made upon the peremptory
order of the President. ?
The contention of tiie internal revenue
office has been that that department had
nothing to do with the enforcement of
the purs-food law. and was concerned
only in seeing that the proper revenue
stamps were affixed to packages contain
ing rectified products.
The issue so sharply drawn for months
between the "straight goods" people and
the rectifiers will now become more acute
than ever, and it is not improbable that
the whole question may find its way into
the courts for adjudication. A writ of
mandamus may be asked to forbid the
Treasury officials from changing the
wording of the present stamp.
BEEF INTERESTS HEARD.
Suggestions as to Regulations Of
fered to Secretary Wilson.
The proposed beef Inspection regula.lons
of the Department of Agriculture were
the subject of a hearing given by Secre
tary Wilson today to a committee rep
resenting the American Beef Packers' As
sociation and other packers throughout
the country. George S. McCarthy, secre
tary of the American Beef Packers' As
sociation and Dr. O. E. Dyson, consulting
veterinarian for independent packers, rep
resented the beef interests.
'FJie proposed regulations had been sub
mitted to the packers, so that criticism of
them might be received before their pro
mulgation. Most of the criticism offered
was in the nature of suggestions for the
clarification of the rules, and In many in
stances objections were fullv t:iet when
the purposes sought by the department
were explained.
The packers were requested to submit
their objections in writing, with the as
surance that they would be carefullv con
sidered.
Hotel Chaperons the Latest.
NEW YORK, December 14.?Hotel
chaperons is the latest idea in New i ork.
It is said that there are many young
women who would like to visit the city
but are unable to do so alone. At least
one big hotel has decided to furnish
chaperons to women who come to New

The fleet was struck by a terrific, south-,
east gale before daybreak today, the
wind reaching a velocity of forty-eight
miles an hour. The sixteen great battle
ships and the auxiliaries that are to ac
company them on the great voyag? rolled
like corks in the water, but the storm
was passed through In safety by the ships.
The wind, which lulled during the morn
ing, dying down to twenty miles an hour,
was followed by a terrific downpour of
rain and a dense fog. The storm made it
difficult for the ships' launchea to pasa
between the vessels.
Owing to the bad weather a reception
and dinner which was to have been given
by Capt. Osterhauss and other officers oc
the flagship Connecticut tonight has been
abandoned.

storm made the massive ships of steel
roll considerably, but those aboard are
used to this, and the storm was not or

such a voyage," wrote the President In
his message to Congress, a statement
which gives official expression to the mag
nitude of the undertaking, whose chief
purpose, it is stated, is "to train a battle
fleet in squadron maneuvers under serv
ice conditions." and It is officially added
tiiat "the only way by which to teach
officers and men how to handle the fleet
so as to meet every possible strain and
emergent in time of war Is to have them
practice under similar conditions In time
of peace."
