Tub gold democratic party is dead. It
was born of perfidy, lived a life of

void of any virtue whatever, it willonly
be remombtred as an example of de
pravity, as the Benedict Arnold and
Judas Iscarriottof American politics. It
profaned the name of democracy, while
organized to- aid the election of repub
licans. It only asked only such gold
neraocrats to support its candidates as
were not sufficiently developed to take
the republican ticket straight.- Silver

territory were located in Britisb Colum
bia, of within the Arctic circle, where
it would require a few thousand dollars
to outfit the prospector, men of wealth
would form syndicates and expend
many thousands of dollars in sending
prospectors to search 'for gold. That
which is hardest to secure seemt to be
considered the most valuable. There is
no longer a doubt of the richness of Ari
zona aa a mineral producer, not alone ot
gold and silvei, but copper, lead and coal
have been found in large quantite, anU
the territory has not been half pros
pected. Even hero in Bisbee, outside
of the Copper Queen, there has been,
comparatively, nothing done in the way
of development work. It ia true the
Copper King and the South Bisbee Town
site people have been doing considerable
work on their properties in the Bhape of
sinking vertical shafts, but the real de
velopment work is scarcely begun.
There are three drifts started on the
Copper King properties nt the 600-level,
but wo.-k has no, been prosecuted suffi
cient as yet to strike the ore body which
is believed to be in close proximity to
these drifts, which are in about 100 feet
each. The Townsite people have not
commenced "drifting yet, but will soon
have reached a point in their shaft work
where drifting and real development
work will begin., There numerous other
properties in this camp, undeveloped,
that so far as desirability of location
and surface showing if concerned, are
just as good as any of the older devel
oped properties, and have in the recesses
of their treasure vaults vast fortunes
for the investor of capital, for nothing
but capital and labor intelligently ap
plied will bring this great mineral
wealth to .daylight. There are many
other camps in the territory that are in
the same condition where one, two
or three good properties have been
developed into dividend payers and. the
balance of the district is virgin soil
pretty generally located but undevelop
ed, but where capital and intelligent
labor would open up bonanzas such as
the world has never yet seen. And
other valuable discoveries ire being
added to list of great producers annually,
and still others yet undiscovered will
sureiy'follow, which only await'the re
port of the piospector and intelligent
application of capital and labor to make
Arizona truly the treasure-land of the
world.
It Is stated that the 1st Territorial,
U. S. Volunteer Infantry, now station

,el"ivicr is any thing but pleasant 'To the
boys, soit is easily observed from the
reports. These' boys are entitled to a
great deal of credit owing to the fact
that they enlisted during a period when
it was considered certain their services
were immediately in demand at the
front, and every one of them expected
it, and were fully determined, if nec
essary, to risk their lives in defense of
their flag, and country. Bisbee has a
goodly number of boys in this regiment,
to whom the citizens extend a kindly
greeting, and will welcome home with
much joy, wishing them . a Merry
Christma and a Happy New Year
wherever they may be.
Au. patriotic citizens will be glad to
know that a hill is to be presented to
congress designed to protect the stars
and stripes from desecration, degrada
tion or insult. The text of the bill it as
follows: "That it Bhall be unlawful
for any person to print, stamp or in any
manner impress upon the flag of thn
United States, er any representation
thereof, any word, figure, design or
impression calculated to serve as an
advertisement of any person's trade,
occupation or 'business, or to publish,
exhibit or use aa an advertisement any
such flag or representation thereof, so
printed, stamped or impressed. Also,
it shall be unlawful for any one to man
ufacture or use the flag or any repre
sentation thereof for clothing, awnings
or in other manner which shall tend to
its desecration." The penalty for
violating the provisions of the bill is
comprised of.a heavy, fine. for the first
offense, and a fine and imprisonment
for a second violation.
Word comes to the Sun at Yuma from
Hedges, Calif., that Robert Templeton,
who is exceedingly well and favorably
known fin Yuma, and who has many
warm friends here, while at work in one
of the mines of the Golden Cross com
pany was caught and crushed whether
by falling timber, rocks or by a car,
our informant does no state, and sus
tained injuries from which he can hardly
recover. One arm and four ribs were
broken and his skull fractured. At last
accounts he was still alive. Tho cause
of the terrible accident is not known.
TitK' republicans have a majority in
both branches of tho fifty sixth con
gress. This insures the continuance of
the war tax until 1000. Tho Dingley
bill continues to produco its regular
monthly deficit. Under bimetallism,
with good prices and good times, the
Dingley bill would produce a largo sur
plus, but under tho gold standard it will
need the aid of the war tax to rnise rev
enue suHlciont to meet the current ex

An 8-year-old school girl waB required
by her teacher to wn'e a composition,
and the next day handed in the follow
ing brief but startling romance;
"Once there was a poor young man
who wat in love with a rich girl whose
mother had a large candy store. The
poor yqung man wanted. to marry the
candy lady's daughter, but he was. too
poor to buy furniture. One day a bad
man offered him $25 dollars to become a
drunkard. The poor young manwas
dreadfully tempted, because ho wanted !
to be rich enough to marry the candy
lauy'a daughter. But when he got to
the saloon door with tho bad man he
said: 'I will not break my pledge even
to be rich. Get the behind me, Satan I'
So he went home and on his way found
a jiocketbook with a $10.,000,000 in it,
Tlusy had a lovely wedding, and tho next
day brought twins. Thus we see that vir

strong that they bring tears to tho eyes
of the potatoes in such vast volumes
that irrigation is unnecessary. The

So far Arizona has experienced a some
what severe winter. Almost evory week
since early in October there has been a
winter Btorm of greater or less, severity.
Old-timers and stockmen, nevertheless,
claim to gain some consolation in the
sayings "that any early winter indicates
an early snriu'." and "that if the win-
j ter staris iu two inonlhe before the fi-st

S. M. DeLong, a ranchman, living

day. He informed an Enterprise
scribe that small bnds of Apache In
dians were scattered about the south
end of tiie Mogollon range and in
the mountains on either side of the Box
canyon of the Frisco. Only a short
time since, two of the tribe camped
near Mule Springs without any effort at
concealment. A couple of weeks ago
five hunters from Clifton, while travel
iigiti the Fiitco countiy, met four
Apaches in a narrow box cauyo't near
Coal creek. The Indians dropped their

and gave Ovo-y ifulicaiiort otViheir
peaceable intentions. The white
men spoke to them but tho In
dians would not reply although
addressed in both English and
Spanish. The white men stood to
one side while their red skin
neighbors passed by. Mr. DeLong
saw the tracks of three Indians cross
ing from Mogollou creek to the Frisco
river. He, in company with another
raucitman, followed the tracks for tev
etal miles, but could not come up with
the red rovers. Tracks of Indians are
