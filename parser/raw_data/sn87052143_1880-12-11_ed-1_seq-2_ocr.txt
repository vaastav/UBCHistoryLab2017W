ME. HAYES TO COUGEESS.
We print Mr. Hayes' message in full.
and we are so fu'l of it that we are cut
down thort on many other things. The
document is principally remarkable for
its longtb. Himself a president by the
greatest political fraud that has been
perpetrated in the century Mr. Haves
sheds hypocritical tears over alleged
outrage against the ballot in the south.
which he dare not attempt to specify.
His Pharisaical disposition is further ev.
idenced by the advocacy ot civil servico
relorm, when he has hardly re-warmed
his seat in the white house alter an tg
nominous flight from the machine that
threatened to violate bis civil service
orders belore his very eyes, unless be
saved himself by precipitate retreat.
He practically advises a republican sen
ate and house to take possession of such
suats in either body as they may need.
This is stalwart doctrine. The repub
licans call it protecting civil rights
Other people will be apt to denominate
it stealing legislative power. Mr. Hayes
is lucid and correct on Mississippi im
provements; tries to shilt his own re
sponsibility tor weakly failing to carry
out the law agajnst polygamy on to the
shoulders ot congress ; ignores the tar
iff, the most important question in
American politics; and suggests subsi
dies as a means of building up our mer
chant marine which bis party has wiped
Irom the seas. There are some vicious
things; many weak ones, a few good
ones, and numerous little matters in the
voluminous document which our read
ers may find if tbey have the patience
t wade through it.

The effort of the department of slate to enlarge

interest iln l hese efforts, its developed In our
commercial communities, and tbe value of the
information secured by this means to the trade
an I iiijiiulaoture of tne country, were rec g
uized by Congress at its last session, and pro
vision was mads lor the more Irequent publica
tion of consular and other reports by the depart-.
Uluut ol stale Tne first issue of this ptibliualioii
has liow been uiepared, and subsequent issues
msy regularly be ejected. The importance
and interest attach -d to the reports ol consular
officers are witnessed by the general demand tor
them bv all classes of merchants aud iiiauulactu
rers engaged in our foreign trade. It is believed
thai Ihe i-vstem ol such publications is deserving
of the approval of congress and that the ueces
sarv appropriations for its continuance and en
largement will commend itsell :o your consider
ation. The prosperous energies of our domest ic
Industries, aud their immense production ol the
snhjei-ts of loreign commerce, invite and even
require an active development of the wishes aud
interests ol'our peo.ile in that direction.
Especially important Is It thai our commercial
relations witb ihe Atlantic and Pacific cotsts ot
South America, with the West Indies, and Ihe
Gull of Mexico should be direct and not through
the eircuirVil European systems, and i should be
carried on in our own bottoms. Tins lull apprecia
tion of the opportunities which our li ont on the
Pacido ocean gives to commerce with Japan.
China and the E ist ladies, with Australia and
the island groups which lie alo ig these routes ol
navigation should inspire efforls to appropriate
...... r- ..mn .,.l m administer by our
own capital a due proportion of this trade.
Whatever innuincations oi our it.
trnda and navigation may be necessary or uselul
to meet and direct these impulse to the enlarge
ment of our exchanges aud of our carrying
trade, 1 am sure the wisdom of congress will be
ready to supply.
One initial measure, however, seems to me
so clearly useful and efficient that I venture to
press it upon vour earnest aueoiiuu. At mv.
to be very evident that the provision or regular
steam postal communication by aid irom the
government has been the loreruuner ol the com
mercial predorainence ot Great Br-taiu on all
these coasts and seas, a greater share in whose
trade is now the desire and the intent of our
people, ft is also inanilost that the etTirts ol
other European nation- lo contend with Great
Brituin lor a share of this commerce have been
successful in proportion with their adoption ol
regular steam postal communications with the
markets whose trade they sought. Mexico and
the states of Soutb Am-nctt are anxious to re
ceive such postal comniuuications with this
country and to aid in their development Sim
ilar co-operation may te looked lor in due time
Irom the eastern nations und from Australia
It is difficult to see how the lead in this move
ment cm be expected from private interests.
Iu respect to foreign commerce, quite us much
as in internal trade, postal communication
seems necessarily a mutter of common and pub
lic administration, ami tbus pertaining to tne
government. I respectlully recommend to your
prompt attention such just aud efficient measures
as may conduce to the development of our for
eign commercial exchanges, and the building
up of our carrying trails.
In this connection 1 desire also to suggest the
very great services which might be expected in

ou tbe east side of the Isthmus, at Chiriipll

'Ihe recoiiiineipiatlou of Ihe secretary uf the

The attorney general recommends Ihe estab

appeals. 11 is recommended that Ibe number
ol judges of the circuit court in each circuit.
With the exception of the second circuit, bhould
be increased by the. addition of an ither judge;
in the second circuit that two should be added;
and that an intermediate nuptliate court should
be lormud in each circuit, to consist of tbe cir

The report oi the commissioner asks attention
p.triiculariy to Ihe eontintied prevalence of an
inl'eciious aud cniit.igiuus cattle disease, known
ami dreaded in Kuropcund Ahih ua cattle plague,
or plitero-pneumouia. A mild type of thia dis
ease, in eertain eeelions of our couutry, is a
great loss to our iuriners, and of serious dis
till bance to our trade with Great Britain, which
lurnishesn market tor m sl ol our livestock

throughout the country are well sustained. In

tton, and colleges lor instruction, theoretical and

totheveVy great neett ol help from the nation

the intelligent direction of the board of educa

griilifyuig. The aois ol congress, from lime lo
time, donating public lands lo the several stM

have proved .o be wise measures of pubiicpolicy
resulting in Krvut aud lastiuic benelit. it would
seem to beamaiier.of simple justice to extend

1 again commend the general interests of tbe
District ol Columbia io the favorable considera

allow 11 by ihe report uf tbe comimasioners, are
in a veiy saliaiactory condition. In my auuual
message heretofore, and in my special message
of Di-ceiuber 1U lST'J, 1 have urged upon the at
tention ol congress tue - necessity of reclaiming
ihe marshes ol th I'otomac udjacent to the capi
tal, und 1 am constrained by its importance to
advert again to the subject These flats em
brace an area of several, hundred acres. Tbey
are un impediment to Ihe drainage of the city,
aud seriously impair their health. It is believed
thai, with this substantial no provement ot its
river Iront, the capital would be. In all respects,
me of the most attractive cuius in Ihe world.
Aside Irom its permanent population Ibis oily is
necessarily ihe place ot residence of persons
irom every section of the country, engaged tn
public service. Many others reside here tempo
rarily, for the transaction of business with the
government. H should not be forgotten that
the land acquired will probably be worth the
cost of reclaiming it, and that the navigation
ul the river will be greatly improved. I there
fore agaiu invite the attention uf congress tu tbe
importance of prompt provision lor this much
needed and loo lung dehtved improvement.
The waler supply ol the city is inadequate.

Does not need a long and tedious conversational argument
to convince the reader that their Mammoth Grocery House
is the largest in Lafayette County, and we say without fear
of contradiction, that we have the

in the market, which consists of the finest and most select
qualities of each.
FANCY GROCERIES !
We have an immense stock of Fancy Groceries, and
pride ourselves on keeping the largest stock of Fine Goods
in Lexington, consisting of English, French and Italian
Imported Goods, and if you intend to give a party or lunch
eon, do not fail to come to our store to get your good
things to eat.
This is what gives us insurmountable advantages
over our competitors: First We have plenty of. ready
cash ; Second Our Mr. Beeding is senior member of a
Wholesale Grocery House, in St. Louis, where lie has su
perior advantages in buying goods, and advantages that no
house in Lafayette County possesses, and advantages which
enable us to buy goods for less than any house in Lexing
ton. We never make assertions that we can not back up
with the proof. Tho above is no idle, meaningless speech,
of which you see copious samples from other merchants
spread over these columns.
Beeding & Clagett.
F. S. We have the finest line of Candies, Fi-rs and
Nuts in the city.
