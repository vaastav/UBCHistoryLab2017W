Touching: Eulog-y on the Late
Senators Davis and ■
Gear.
WASHINGTON, Dec. 3.—ln the senate
today the work of the short session of
the fifty-sixth congress was successfully
launched. It had been the purpose of
the senate to announce the deaths cf
Senators Gear, of lowa and Davis, of
Minnesota, immediately after assembling
and then to adjourn and then receive the
message of the president tomorrow, but
as this had been announced by leaders
of both branches to be a "business ses
sion," it was determined to receive the
message today and thus gain one day in
a session when that much time may be
of immense importance.
Aside from the reading of the mes
sage and the administration of
the oath of office to W. B.
Dillingham, the new senator from
Vermont, who succeeds the . late
Justin S. Morrill, no business was trans
acted. The other new member 1 of the
body, former Representative John P.
Dolliver, who succeeds the late Senator
Gear, of lowa, was present throughout
the session, but his credentials were not
presented and he was not sworn in.
These formalities will "be completed to
morrow, now that the senate has been
informed officially of the death of Sen
ator Gear.
When the senate convened It was with
in the shadow of death of two of Its
most distinguished members.
Since the senate last convened, a great
national campaign has been inaugurated,
and conducted to a conclusion, and as sen
ators assembled they exchanged political
greetings as well as the warm hand
clasps of personal friendship. A notable
meeting on the floor just before the ses
sion opened was that between Mr. an
na, of Ohio, and Mr. Jones, of Arkansas,
the chairman, respectively, of the Repub
lican and Democratic rational campaign
committees. Surrounded by many of
their colleagues they exchanged cordial
greetings and laughed and chatted for
several minutes.
The air of the chamber was heavy
with the perfume from magnificent floral
pieces.
TRIBUTE TO THE DEAD.
Tire fall of Senator Five's gavel caused
a hush to fali over the chamber at 12
o'clock, and then Mr. Millburn, the ven
erable, blind chaplain, in a beautiful
prayer, paid touching tributes to the
deaths of Senators Davis and Gear.
Tho call of the roll disclosed the pres
et! »- of sixty-one senators, and the sen
ate men proceeded to routine business.
William B. D.Kingham was sworn in
to fill the unexpired term of the late
Justin S. Morrill. A solution by Mr.
Hoar (Mass.), that a committee of sen
ators be appointed to join a similar com
mittee of the house to inform the presi
dent that congress was in ses?icn and
ready to receive any communication he
might have to make, was adopts
The .hair appointed Senators Hear and
Cock ell. ' £•::
The senate, on motion of Mr. Hale,
then took a recess of forty minutes, and
on reassembling Mr. Hoar announced
that the president had expressed his
pleasure that congress once more was In
session, and that he would communicate
With it forthwith. -•>.-..
Instantly Maj. Pruden, one of the sec
retaries to the president, was recognized,
and presented the awaited message of
the president. It took Mr. Beiin.tt, the
secretary of the senate, one hour and
fifty-four minutes to read it..
Mr. Allison then announced the death
in July last of his colleague, Senator
John Henry Gear, and offered the usual
resolution of sorrow, which was adopted.
Mr. Nelson (Minn.-), who had returned
only, two hours before from St. Paul,
announced formally the death of Sena
tor Davis, saying that in his death "the
nation has lost one of its wisest public
servants, and the state of Minnesota one
of its most distinguished sons."
Then senate then, at 3:45 o'clock p. m.
upon motion of Mr. Allison, as an addi
tional mark of respect for the memories
of Senator Gear and Senator Davis, ad
journed.
SENATORIAL PROGRAMME.
The Republican senatorial committee
on order of business this afternoon de
cided the ship subsidy bill should displace
the Spooner Philippines bill as unfinished
business. It also considered at the same
time the disposition of the Hay-Paunee
fote treaty and decided that the.question
would receive alternate attention with
the shipping bill. The arrni-^pnt. pro
vides that the shipping bill shall have
preference, but that when no one is pre
pared to make a speech on it the senate
shall go into, executive session for the
consideration of the treaty.
In accordance with this understanding,
Senator Frye at the first opportunity tol
morrow will move to take up the bill,
and if this motion prevails, as there is
little doubt it will, the effect will be to
displace the Spooner bill, which there is
no disposition at this time to press Sen
ator Frye- probably will make a speech.
It is not expected that any other senator
■will be prepared to proceed on the sub
sidy measure, and in that event Senator
Lodge, of the committee on foreign re
lations, who will have charge of the
treaty, will move an executive session in
order to consider the treaty.
The arrangement further provides that
if the army bill reaches the senate prior
to ; the vdisposal of the shipping
bill or the treaty, either or both
of these may be displaced temporarily
ln order to permit the prompt considera
tion of that measure, which is considered
to be of more pressing Importance than
either of the other questions. The same
understanding prevails regarding the ap
propriation bills.
Senator Morgan's Nicaraguan canal bill
received some consideration at the hands
of the committee on order of business.
While no definite agreement was reached
concerning it, the opinion was generally
expressed that it should wait upon the
senate's action for the treaty. The
members of the committee apparently
consider that the ratification of the
treaty is a necessary preliminary to the
passage of the canal bill, and the present
disposition Is to contend for that order
of precedence.
The committee also discussed the pos
sibility of Democratic opposition to the
subsidy bill. Some of the members who
Had talked with Democratic senators ex
pressed tilic opinion that there would be
no effort to prevent this legislation by
factious opposition, though they expect a
number of speeches against it.

WASHINGTON, Dec. 3.—The «. opening
of the session in the. house was brilliant,
but not exciting. There 'were the usual
throngs in the galleries, and the usual
display of floral'pieces on the floor, but
the proceedings were purely formal, con
sisting of the rapping to order by the
speaker, prayer by the chaplain, the roll
call of members, the appointment of the
formal committees to wait upon the
president, and the reception and reading
of the president's message. Despite the
fact that a great presidential campaign
had concluded within a month, the best
of feeling seemed to prevail between Vic
tors and vanquished. The reading of
the message, which naturally was the
feature of the day, occupied over two
hours. It was listened to with respect
ful interest by both sides. The deaths of
the late Representatives Daly (N. J.)
and Hoeffecker (Del.), and Senators Da
vis (Minn.) and Gear (Io.), were an
nounced, and as a further mark of re
spect to their memories the house ad
journed until tomorrow. , .
When Speaker Henderson called the
house to order at noon the desks of half
the members were freighted with flowers
from admiring friends or constituents,
and. the profusion of the floral pieces
gave the vast hall more the apearance of
a garden than a legislative assembly.
The floral pieces were of infinite varie
ty. Roses, carnations and. chrysanthe
mums of every hue were made into
every conceivable design. The greater
proportion of the flowers was cj.r the Re
publican side, and one could mark the
geographical limits of. "the party in the
recent campaign by the flowered area.
They usually marked the seat of one
who had won a personal triumph. In
the galleries the wealth and beauty cf
the capital was present gowned in smart
winter frocks.
A rap with a gavel from £!peaker Hen
derson commanded the assemblage on
the floor and gallery to remain quiet,
and then |the blind chaplain referred
feelingly' to the deaths of the late Rep
resentatives ..Daly, of New Jersey, and
Hoeffecker, of Delaware, which occurred
during the recess.
The speaker then directed the clerk to
cad the roll.
As soon as the clerk began the con
versation on the floor and in the gal
leries was resumed. The conversation
became so great that the clerk could not
hear the responses, and the speaker was
obliged several times to call for order.
The speaker announced that-275 mem
bers had responded to their names a
quorum, and the house was ready for
business. The following then- appeared
at the bar and took the oath: Albert D
Shaw, who succeeds the late Represent
tative 'kerin^ of New York; Allen
F. Mc-Denmott, who success the late
Representative Daly, of New Jersey:
Walter O. Hoeffecker. who -succeeds tme
late Representative. Hoeffecker. of Dela
ware; Edward de V." Morrell, who suc

Pennsylvania; Wm. Richardson, who suc

a. Jackson, who succeeds Gov. Smith of
Maryland; Samuel D. Woods, who suc
ceeds Representative D. Vrie-' of Cal

Mr. Bailey, of Texas," questioned the
££? rv V c re T s T^ nation of Representa
tive Dolliver. He said- he doubted the
right of a member to resign, at a future
fixed date. lie said he would not raise
the Point formally, but. merely called
the attention to it so that in the future
it could not be used as a precedent.
Mr. Dolhver's resignation, he said had
been tendered to take effect De- 1 so
that Mr. Conner had been elected to' fill
a vacancy, which did not exist at the
time of the ejection. He cited a de
cision to show that a resignation to take
effect at a future date was not a resig
nation in fact, but simply a notification
of a resignation to be made in the future.
Mr. Bailey said he did not desire to press
the matter, but desired the protest to be
filed.  .
The speaker stated that* inasmuch as
objection had been made, Me. Connor
would step aside until the protest had
been disposed of.
The speaker announced the appoint
ment of Mr. Eabcock, of Wisconsin on
the committee on ways and means to
succeed Mr. Dolliver.
Messrs. Payne (Rep., N. V.); Gros
venor (Rep., O.) and Richardson (Dem
Term,), were appointed to join the com
mittee of the senate to notify the presi
dent that congress was in session and
ready to receive any^ommunication from
him.
The clerk was also directed by resolu
tion to notify the senate that the house
was ready to do business. After the
adoption of these formal resolutions the
house at 1 o'clock took a recess until
2 o'clock, when the president's message
was listened to attentively.
The reading occupied two hours and ten
minutes. There were no demonstrations
during the"reading, but as' the clerk
finished, there was a scattering round
of applause on .the Republican side.
The deaths of the late Representative
Hoeffecker, of Delaware; the late Rep
resentative Daly, of New Jersey; the late
Senator Geor, of lowa and the late m
ator Davis,' of Minnesota were then an
nounced and after the adoption of reso
lutions of regret, the house as a further
mark of respect, to .the memory of thi
deceased statesmen, at 4:20 p. m ad
journed. - '"".' '- :-. -V..

ANDERSON'S RAILROAD TAXATION
STATUTE IS DECIDED UN
CONSTITUTIONAL v
m unoiiL mum CCDST
STATE v CAN'T COLLECT LAND TAX
AND GROSS EARNINGS
AS WELL
FORMER LAW IS A CONTRACT!
Decision Was Unanimous, Though
the Justices Did Not Agree as
to Their Grounds .
Therefor.
WASHINGTON, Dec. 3.—The supreme
court has knocked out the Anderson law
on constitutional. grounds. The case is
remanded Tor a new trial in Steams
county. V
The decision is a victory for the North
ern Pacific, the St. Paul & Duluth and
subsidiary lines, but does not include the
Great Northern.
The court was unanimous.
The case came to this court on error to
the supreme ;court of the state of Min
nesota. It was brought up at the in
stance of certain railroad companies, and
involved the question of whether real es
tate belonging to them not used in the
operation of their roads is subject to tax
ation according to its value, or is ex
cepted by virtue of a contract-alleged to
have been made several years ago
through legislation by the state, providing
that- railroad companies should pay 3
per cent on their gross earnings in lieu
of taxes on all property.
The taxes of the St. Paul & Duluth
railway company were immediately in
volved in this case.
The case also included the question of
the validity of the Minnesota law of 1895,
repealing the ro"rmer contract law and
seeking to separate the lands of rail
roads from their other property for pur
poses of taxation, still retaining the 3 pe r
cent tax on gross earnings.
ACT IS WORTHLESS.
The effect of today's opinion is to hold
the law of 1805 invalid.
In passing upon the case the court held
that the state had been admitted to the
sisterhood of states under the usual cm
pact, and that as long as the title of its
lands remains .in the United States' tho ?e
lands are exempt from taxation. So far
as the land involved in this case is con
cerned, it was stated that it had been
granted to the state by congress and by
the slate to the St. Paul & Duluth com
pany. Soon afterwards, the justice con
tinned, the state had enacted legislation
providing that railroads in the state
should pay 2 per cent on their gross earn
ings, in lieu of all other taxes upon their
property.
The opinion by Justice Brewer sustain
ed the view that the original legislation
was in the nature of a contract, which
was binding and which could- not be in
validated by the act of 1895, seeking to
repeal it. This latter act, therefore, was
pronounced repugnant to the federal con
stitution and void In this respect.
Justices Harlan, Gray, Brown, White
and McKenna concurred In the result,
but did not agree with their colleagues
as to the grounds on which the conc"us;on
was reached. Justice Brewer read the
decision.
OF GREAT IMPORTANCE.
C. W. Bunn, attorney for the Northern
Pacific railway, was seen last night by
a reporter of the Globe, and in refer
ence to the above dsclsion, said:
"It is a long story, and I cannot new
go into the history of the case as fully
as I would like to. It has been a most
important case, one involving a very
large sum of money, and the supreme
court of the United States has sustained
the position taken by the railroad com
panies interested, the Great Northern and
the St. Paul & Duluth, on every point at
issue.
"What Is known as the Anderson law
was first brought before the state legis
lature under the name of the Markham
bill in 1893. It was defeated at that ses
sion, but two years later was re-introduc
ed by August Anderson, of Chisaem coun
ty, and was passed In the house. Th - sen
ate also passed it by a majority of one
vote and at the next election it was en
dorsed by the pople. The railway com
panies party to the action just derided,
never paid the money due under the as
sessments provided for in the new law."
It so happened that the bill passed the
senate by. this scant majority after Sen
ator Frank A. Day had succeceded to
the presidency of the senate on the pro-

PALLAS S TEX.j SALOOtf
DALLAS, Tex.. Dec. Screams of
agony brought policemen to a saloon in
East Dallas early this morning. Seated
in a chair, unable to move, was a man
whose garments were a mass of flames.
The officers say Eugene Faulkner and J.
W. Chapman were standing behind. the
bar, smoking cigars and watching the
unfortunate man, who was being roasted
to death. "Bring some water here,
quick!" shouted an officer. "Get it your
self," the policeman declared one of the
men rertoted. g "Let him die; what's the
use of worrying over him?" One of the
officers took off his coat and with it beat"
out the- fire. The man was sent to the
city hospital, where he died within a
few hours. Soon after his arrival at
the hospital the two men who-were In
the barroom were brought before him for
identification. Then it was that the
discovery was made that his eyes had
been burned: out. He was Pate Bain,
for many years a constable at Garland,

motion of Lieut. Gov. Clough to succeed
Senator Knute Nelson as-governor.
When the next election rolled around
and the contention was raised that Day
had forfeited his seat in the senate by
becoming lieutenant governor, ; although
only one half of his four years' N «enatoiial
term had expired,' it was insisted by
many that this was the first step in an
effort to break down the Anderson law by
contesting the regularity of its passage,
Day having been one of those who voted
for it, and without whose vote is would
have been .lost on a tie.
The legislature unseated Day under the
whip hand of .the Rpublican state central
committee, although his ostensible griev
ance was his leaning toward tree silver
rather than his altitude on this bin.
■ The courts, however, later declared his
unseating unwarranted, and he was re
imbursed for his expanses in defending
his right to a seat in .the senate during
the session of lSi'7. That summer litiga
tion was begun. Mr. Burin say's:
GREAT NORTHERN NOT TN IT.
"Fred Steams, auditor of Aitkin county,
left out two pieces of railroad land from
the tax rolls, and the'then attorney gen
eral, Childs, commenced mandamus pro
ceedings to have the land placed back on
the tax rolls. The matter came before
Judge Holland at Brainerd, and he grant
ed the write. >
"The case was next taken to the su
preme court, cf the; state, where Judge
Holland's decision 'was affirmed. Then'
proceedings in error were instituted in
the supreme court at -Washington,' "and.
to make a long story short, that court
has decided in favor of the. railways, and
by virtue of this last decision, the And
erson law is quashed, a; being uncon
stitutional.-. •_' - ■--.;
"The companies immediately interest
ed in this decision, c, re the Northern Pa
cific and the St. S Paul & Duluth. Other
roads are also interested, but they are
not parties to the.present suit."
"How much would-we have had to pay
if the decision had been the other way?"
"The lands "formerly, owned '-by. the St.
Paul & Duluth- have also been sold, but
In the event of an adverse decision, the
state would have had probably $200,000
coming.
"I said before that tihe Great Northern
was not concerned in this decision. This
is true, but at the same time it has a
better case than had we. Most of the
land grant of the - Northern Pacific was
obtained under an act of 1565, while that
of the Great Northern was granted under
previous acts of territorials days, and the
contract held by that company exempting
its lands from special taxation is, I think,
confessedly a good contract.
"There are other companies which. will
welcome today's decision, for all the
money that has been paid by any of
them is now known to have been paid
under the provisions of a law that is
unconstitutional. -
j "What the Washington court has done
amounts to declaring that the Minnesota
legislature had no power , to pass such
a law as the Anderson law. The condi
tions under which, the grants were made
originally are safeguarded by the "con
stitution of the. United States and cannot
be violated by the legislature.." .
The case has been argued' before the
supreme .court at Washington twice;
once last spring, when a rehearing of
. the case was ordered, and on Oct. 15 last.
Mr. Bunn and Mr. Hornblower, of New
York, appeared r for the- railway com
panies, and Attorney General Douglas

officers that Bain was drugged, and as

WASHINGTON.Dec. 3.—President Mc-
Kinley's annual message to the congress
of the United States, delivered today by
Secretary Pruden after .the. assembling
of the two bodies, is as follows:
To the.Senate and House of Represen
tativesAt the outgoing of the old and
the Incoming of the new-century you be
gin the last session of the fifty-sixth
congress with * evidences on every hand
of individual and national prosperity and
with proof of the growing strength and
increasing power for good of Republican
institutions. Your countrymen will join
with you in felicitation that American
liberty, is more firmly established than
ever before, and that love for it and the
determination to preserve it are more
universal than at any former pe»od of
our history.
The republic was never so strong, be
cause never so strongly intrenched in the
hearts of the people as now. The con
stitution, with lev amendments, exisis
as it left the hands of its authors. The
additions 'which have been made to it
proclaim -larger freedom and more ex
tended citizenship/ Popular government
has demonstrated in its 121 years of trial
here its stability and . security, and its
efficiency as 'the- best instrument of na
tional development and best safeguard
to human rights.
When the sixth congress assembled in
November, 1800, the population of the
United States was 5,305;«3. It is 76.504.7J*.
Then we had sixteen states. Now we
nave forty-five. Then our territory con
sisted of 909,050 square miles. it is now
3,510.555 square miles. Education, religion
and morality have kept pace with our
advancement in other directions, and
while extending its power the govern
ment has adhered to its foundation prin
ciples and abated none of them in dealing
with our new peoples and possessions.
A nation so preserved and blessed give1 *

guidance and the continuance of h*s care
and favor. . - -
CHINESE PROBLEM.
Causes of the Uprrsing and the Dip-
lomatic Status.
In our foreign intercourse the dominant |
question-has been the-treatment of the j
Chinese problem. Apart from this our re- ;
lations with the powers have been hap- !
py. -. -*'•"■
The recent troubles .in China spring I
from the a»tiforeign agitation which for?
the past three years has gained strength !
in the northern provinces. Their origin
lies deep. in the character of the Chinese
races and in the traditions of their gov
ernment; - The .Taiping srebellion and the
opening of Chinese ports to "foreign-trade
and settlement disturbed alike the
homogeneity and the seclusion of China.
Meanwhile foreign activity, made itself
felt', in all quarters, .not alone on the, :'
coast, but along the great river arteries '
and in . the remoter districts, carrying
hew ideas and introducing new associa- !
tions among a primitive people which
had pursued for centuries a national!
policy of., isolation.' ... \
The telegraph and the'railway spread-,
ing over their land, the steamers plying
on their waterways, the merchant and
the missionary penetrating year by year
farther to the interior, became to the
Chinese mind types of an alien invasion, ;
changing the course of their national
life and fraught with vague forebodings j
of disaster to their beliers and their self- ;
control.
For several years before the present \
troubles all the resources of foreign diplo- i
macy, backed by moral dominations and
physical force of fleets and arms, have
been needed to secure due respect fur
the treaty rights of foreigners and to
obtain satisfaction from . the responsible
authorities for the sporadic outrages up
on the persons and property of unoffend
ing sojourners, which from "time to time
occurred at widely separated points in
the " northern provinces, as in the case
of the outbreaks in Szechuen and Shan- I
tung.
- Posting of antiforeign placards became I
a daily occurrence, which the repeated ;
reprobation of the imperial nower failed !
to check or punish. These inflammatory i
appeals to the ignorance and supersti- i
tion of the. masses, mendacious and ab- I
surd in their accusations and deeply hos- '■
tile in their spirit, could not but work i
cumulative harm. They aimed at no '
particular class of foreigners; they were '
, impartial, in attacking everything for- j
eign.
An outbreak in Shantung, in which Ger- '
man missionaries were slain, was the i
too natural result of . these malevolent i
teachings. The posting of -seditious pla- j
cards, exhorting to the utter destruc
tion, of foreigners and of every foreign
thing, continued, unrebuked. Ho«ti'e
demonstrations toward the stranger gain- I
ed strength by organization.
SUPPORTED BY OFFICIALS.
The sect commonly styled the Boxers I
developed greatly in the provinces north I
of the Yangste, and with the collusion of ;
many notable officials, including some in ■!
the immediate councils of the throne it
self, became alarmingly aggressive. No
foreigner's .life, outside of the protected
lieaty ports, was safe. No foreign interest j
was secure from spoliation.
The diplomatic representatives of the
powers in Pekin strove in vain to che^k
this movement. Protest was followed by j
demand, and demand by renewed protest, I
to be met with perfunctory edicts from '
the. palace and evasive and futile assur- I
ances from the tsung II yamen. Thi- cir- :
cle of the Boxer influence narrowed about :
Pekin, and while nominally stigmatized j
as seditious, it was felt that its spirit per
vaded the capital itself, that the imperial
forces were imbued with its doctrines and
that the immediate counselors of the em
press dowager were in full sympathy with
the anti-foreign movement.
UNITED STATES POLICY.
The increasing gravity of the conditions
hi China and the imminence of peril to
cur own diversified interests in the em
pire, as .well as to those:of all the other
treaty governments, were soon appreciat
ed by this government, causing it pro
found solicitude. The'Unlted'States, from
the earliest days of foreign intercourse
with China, hail followed a .policy, of
peace, 1 omitting no,, occasions to testify
good will, to further- the extension of law-;
ful : trade, to respect - the sovereignty of
its government,: and to insure by all le
gitimate, and kindly but earnest means
the fullest measure of protection for the
lives and property of our law-abiding cit
izens and for the.exercise of their benefi
cent, callings among the Chinese peop'c.
r/. Mindful of this, it was felt to be appro
priate .that our | purposes^ should be pro. |
r.ounccd in favor of such course as would
hasten united action of the powers in Pe
kin to promote _ the • administrative • re-:
forms so \ greatly needed for strengthen
ing the-, imperial government and main
taining , the: integrity of China, in which
we believe the .whole Western world to
be alike concerned. To these ends I caus
:ed to be addressed ; to tne several • powers
occupyingii territory and maintaining
spheresl of influence in China ' the jj circu
lar .proposals: of .1899, inviting from them
declarations of their intentions and views
as to 1 the desirability of the 'adoption, of.

POWERS AGREE. ■'■■- r
s With gratifying unanimity the re
sponses . coincided, in this common policy,
enabling me to see in the successful ter- I
mination of these friendly negotiations, I
proof of the friendly ; spirit which ani
mated the various , powers interested In I
the untrammeled development of coh
merce and industry \ in.be Chinese em
pire, as a source, of vast benefit to the
whole commercial world.
In this conclusion, which I had the grat
ification to announce as a-completed en
gagement to the interested powers on
March 20, 1900, I hopefully . discerned a
potential factor for the abatement of the
distrust of foreign purposes which for a
year past had appeared to inspire the pol
icy of the imperial government, and for
the effective exertion by it of power and
authority to quell, .the critical anti-for- I
eign movement in the northern provine* I
most immediately influenced by th*>
Manchu sentiment.
Seeking to testify confidence in the iwll
mgness and ability of the Imperial ad
ministration to redress the wrongs and
prevent the evils we suffered and feared,
the marine guard, which had been sent to
Pekin in the autumn of 1899 for the pro
tection of the legation/ was withdrawn
at the earliest practicable moment, and
ail pending questions were remitted, as
far as we were concerned, to the ordinary
resorts of diplomatic intercourse.
The Chinese' government proved, how
ever, unable to check the rising strength
ol the Boxers, and appeared to be a prey
to internal dissensions. In the unequal
contest- the anti-foreign influence soon
gained the ascendancy under the leader
ship of Prince Tuan. Organized arm!
of Boxers, with which the imperial forces
affiliated, held the country between Pekin
and the coast, penetrated into Manchuria,
up to the Russian border, and through
their emissaries threatened a like upris
ing throughout northern China.
FLEET ASSEMBLED,
Attacks upon foreigners, destruction of
their property and slaughter of native
converts were reported from: all sides.
The tpung-li-yamen, already permeated
with hostile sympathies, could make no
effective response to the' appeals of the
legations. At this critical juncture, in |
the early-spring of j the year, a proposal |
was made by the other powers that a
combined "fleet should be assembled in
Chinese waters as a moral demonstration
under cover of which to exact of the Chi
nese government respect for foreign trea
ty.- lights and the suppression of the I
Boxers. ■'- - - -
The United States, while not participat
ing in" the joint demonstration, - sent"
from the Philippines all the ships that
could be spared for service on the Chi
pea coast. A .small .force, of marines was
landed at Taku and sent to Pekin for the
protection ,of the. American legation.
Other powers; took similar action, until
some 400 men,were, assembled in the capi
tal as legation guards.
Still the peril increased. . The legations
reported the development of the seditious
movement in Pekin, and the need of in
creased provision for defense against it
v\ hile preparations were, in . progress for
a large expedition to strengthen the le
gation guards and.keep the railway open
an attempt of .the foreign ships to make
a landing at Taku was met by a fire from
the Chinese forts. The forts were there
upon shelled by the foreign vessels, the
American admiral taking no part in the
attack en the ground that we were not
at war with China, and that a hostile
demonstration might consolidate the ahli
foreign elements and strengthen th*
Borers to oppose the relieving column. "'
- wo.days later the Taku forts were
captured after a sanguinary conflict Sev
erance of communication with Pekin i <!
lowed, and a combined force of additional
guards, /which was advancing to Pekin

SIEGE OF THE LEGATIONS.
.The siege and the relief of the legations
has passed into undying nistorv in all '
the stirring chapter which records the I
heroism of the devoted band, clinging to '
hope in the face of despair," and the un- i
daunted spirit that led their relievers
through battle and suffering to the goal '
it is a memory of whi.?n my countrymen
may be justly proud, that the honor of
our flag -was maintained- aMke in the !
siege | and the rescue, and that stout
American hearts have again set hi°-h in
fervent emulation with true men of"other
race and language, the indomitable cour
age that ever strives for the course of
right and justice. •
a I'y June 19 the legations were cut eft I
An identical note from the' yam
ordered each minister to leave Pekin
underji.promised escort, within twentv
four hours. To gain time thsv replied
asking prolongation of the time, wh eh
was afterwards granted, and requesting
an interview with the tsung-li-yamen on
the following day. No reply being re I
ceived. on the morning of the 20th. the
German minister, Baron yon Kettele^, set
out for the .yamen to obtain a response
and on the way was murdered
An attempt by the legation guard to re- I
cover his body was foiled by the Chi
nese. Armed, forces, turned out against '
the legations. Their quarters were sur
rounded and attacked. The mission com- I
pounds were abandoned, their inmates
taking .refuge .in the British legation,
where all the other legations and guards
gathered for more effective defense. Fcui
hundred persons were crowded in its
narrow, compass. Two thousand native
converts .were assembled in a near-by '
palace under, protection of the fores:
ers. The lines of de. ease were strength
ened, trenches dug, barricades raised and
preparations* marie to stand a siege j
which; at once began.
SHOT AND FIRE. >
"From June "20 until July 17," writes |
Minister Conger, "there was scarcely an !
hour during which there 1 was not firing !
upon some part '■' of our lines and into j
some of the legations, varying from a |
single shot to a general and continuous
attack along the whole line.". Artillery
was placed around the legations and on |
the . overlooking palace, and thousands !
of three-inch shells were fired, destroying
some buildings and damaging, all. So
thickly did the balls rain, that when the
ammunition of. the besieged ran low. five
quarts of.Chinese bullets were gathered
in an hour in one compound and recast.
; Attempts were .made to burn the lega
tions, by setting neighboring houses on
fire, but : the flames were successfully
fought off/although tne Austrian, Belgian.
Italian and Dutch | legations were then
and subsequently burned. With the aid
of the native converts, directed by the
missionaries, to whose helpful co-cpera
tion Mr. Conger awards unstinted praise,
the British legation was made a veritable
fortress. The British minister, Sir
Claude"' McDonald, • was „ chosen ; general
commander of the defense, with the sec- !
retary of the American legation, E. G.
Squires," as chief rof staff..
To save 4 life and ammunition the be-1
sieged : sparingly £ returned - the incessant
fire, of the Chinese soldiery, fighting only
to repel attack or make an occasional sue- J
cessful; sortie for strategic advantage, such
as^ th5 t of fifty-five American, British
and Russian marines, . led by. Capt
Myers, of the United States marine corps!
which resulted in the capture of a for
midable barricade on the wall that" grave
ly menaced the American position. It
was held to he last and proved an in
valuable acquisition, because commanding
the water gate through which the relief
column entered.
During the siege the defenders lost 65
killed, lbs wounded and 7 bydisease, the
last all children.

communication with the tsung-li-vamen.
from whom a message came inviting to a
conference,which was declined. Corres
pondence, however, ensued, and a sort of
armistice was agreed upon, which stopped
the bombardment and lessened the rifle
fire for a* time. Even then no protection
whatever was afforded, nor any aid given
save to send to the legations a small
supply of fruit and three sacks of flour.
GOVERNMENT RESPONSIBLE,
Indeed, the only communication had
with the Chinese government related to
the occasional delivery or dispatch of a
telegram or to the demands of the tsung
li-yamen for the withdrawal of the lega
tion to the coast under escort. " »Not" only- •
are the protestations of the Chinese gov
ernment that ; it protected and succored
the legations positive,y .contiadicied but
irresistible proof accumulates that the
attacks upon them were made by im
perial troops, regularly uniformed, armed
and officered, belonging to the command
ot Jung Lv, the imperial commander-in
chief. Decrees encouraging the Boxers,
organizing them uuier eminent im „ rial
officers, provisioning them, and ' even
granting them large sums in the name of
tne empress dowager are known to ex
ist. Members of the yamen who coun
seled protection of the foreigners were
beheaded. Even in the distant provinces
men suspected of foreign sympathy were
put to death, prominent among them be
ing Chang Yen-Hoon, formerly Chinese
minister in "Washington »
.-With, the negotiation of 'the partial
armistice of July. 14, a proceeding which -
was doubtless promoted by the represen
tations of the Chinese envoy in Washing
ton, the way was opened for the convey
ance to Mr. Conner of a test message
sent by. the secretary, of state through
the kind offices of Minister Wu Ting
F*ng Mr. Conger's reply, dispatched
from Pekin on J_sly 18, through the same
channel, affordea to the outside world
the first tidings that the inmates of the
legations were still alive and hoping for
succor. .-.-,. ;-- . ,
RELIEF COLUMN.
This news-stimulated the preparations
for _a Joint relief expedition in numbers
sufficient to overcome -. the resistance
which, for a month, had been organizing
between Taku and the capital. Rein
forcements sent by all the co-operating
governments were constantly arriving.
i he United States contingent, hastily as
sembled from the Philippines or dis
patched from-this country, amounted to
some 5,000 men, under the able command
first of the lamented Col. Liscum and af
terwards Gen. Chaffee.
Toward the end of July the movement
began. A severe conflict followed at
Tien Tsin, in . which Col. Liscuni was
killed. The city was stormed and nearly
destroyed. Its capture afforded the base
of operations from which to make the
final advance, which-began in the first
days of August, the "■'expedition ing
made up of Japanese. Russian, British
and American troops at the outset.
Another battle was fought and won at
Yangtsun. Thereafter the disheartened
Chinese troops offered little show of re
sistance. A few days latter the impor
tant position of Ho-si-woo was taken -V--
--rapid march 1 he united "forces-to
the populous city of Tung-chow, which
capitulated without a contest.
rEKIN ENTERED. - " '
On August 14 the capital was reached.
After a brief conflict beneath the walls
the relief column entered and th ■ lega- :
tions were saved. The United States
soldiers, sailors and marines, officers and
men alike, those distant climbs and
unusual surroundings, showed the same
valor, discipline and good -conduct and ,';
gave proof of the same high degree vi
intelligence and efficiency which have
distinguished them in every emergency.
The imperial family and the govern- -
ment had fled a few days before. The
city was without visible control. Th- re
maining imperial soldiery had made on
the night of the 13th a last attempt to
exterminate the seiged, which was gal
lantly, repelled. It fell to the occupying
forces to restore order and organize a
provisional administration.
Happily the acute disturbances .were
confined to the Northern provinces.' It
is a relief to recall and a pleasure to
record the loyal conduct of the viceroys
and local authorities of the South ami
Eastern provinces. Their efforts were
continuously directed to the pacific con
trol of. the vast populat'ons u.id.-r their -
rule and to the scrupulous observance of
foreign treaty rights. At cr.tica! mo
ments they did not hesitate to memoral
ize the throne, urging the protection of
the legations, the restoration of • m
municat'.on and the assertion of the im
perial. authority against the subversive
elements. They maintained exce lent re
lations with the official representatives
of foreign powers. To their kind y dis
position is largely due the success of the
consuls' removing many.of the mis-ion
aries from the inteiior to i la-.-es of "
safety. ;In this relation the\a_tlon of
the consuls should be highly comm'en red.
In Shangtung and Eastern Chili-the task •
was difficult, but, thanks to their en
ergy -and the co-operation of-American
and foreign naval'commanders, hundreds
of foreigners,, including those of other
nationalities than ours, were rescued -
from imminent peril.
NOTE TO TRE TOWERS.
The policy of the United State? through
all the trying period was clrar.y an
nounced and scrupulously carried out.
A circular note to the powers, dated
July 3, proclaimed cur attitude. Treating
the condition in the North as una of
virtual anarchy, in which the great
provinces of the South and Southeast
had no share,- we regarded the local au- .
thorities in the latter quarters as. rep
resenting-the Chinese people with whetfc '-r
we sought to remain in peace and friend- ,
ship. Our declared aims involved no :
war against the Chinese nation. We ad- -^
hered to the legitimate office of rescuing
the imperiled legation, obtaining redress
for wrongs :already: suffered, securing,
wherever possible the safety of Amer
ican life and property in China, and pre-".;
venting a spread of the disorders or their'
recurrence.
As was then said, "the Policy of the
government of the United Stage's is to ;
seek a. solution which may bring ;.b ut
harmony and- peace In China", preserve ,
Chinese • territoiial and administrative
entity, protect all rights guaranteed to
friendly powers by treaty and " interna*
tionai: law, and, safeguard, for the world -
the principle of equal and impartial tirade .;•.-,
.with all parts •of the . Chinese empire." .r".
Faithful -to,those professions,, which, as .
it proved, reflected the vi*ws and pur
poses • of the other co-operating . govern- :.
