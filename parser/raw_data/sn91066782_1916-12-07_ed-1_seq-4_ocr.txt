Willoughby lake is to have a remod
eled hotel. Willoughby lake is large
enough and attractive enough to have
several hotels and to have them occupied
during the summer, providing judicious
publicity is used. One drawback of the
place as a summer resort has been the
inability to rare for those who admire
splendid scenery. Heretofore Willough

round-trip excursion for a single day;
whereas it might be the stopping-place
of hundreds of people every season and
for long periods.
The Vermont deer hunting season of
1016 was not without the usual (junta of
human casualties, including one death.
One feature in connection with the hu
man casultieg is the fact that all or near
ly all the accidents occurred during the
early part 'of the open Beason, when the
hunters were both more numerous and
more feverish in their desire to bring
down a buck. As the open season length
ened the human casualty list diminished
markedly, until during the last week or
so no accidents were reported. Another
feature, and this is distinctly encourag
ing, is that no persons were shot because
they wece mistaken for deer or other
game.
When a small and hitherto little
known college pets into a position in
which it is able to cope w ith one of the
large universities in football, the large
universities immediately tind they have
urgent business elsewhere and thep drop
the small but formidable adversaries
from the annual schedule of games. For
instance, Colgate university, an institu
tion of slightly more than fiOfl students,
has been sweeping the football gridirons
of the East for two years until it has
become a real contender for the cham
pionship each season, havim: this year
defeated all comers except Yale and be
ing beaten by that opponent by the very
narrowest of margins. Xow comes the
proposal by Yale to drop Colgate from
the schedule in order to take on a weak
er opponent that can be mauled about
the football arena to the delight of the
coaches of the winning team. To re
main on the schedules of the large uni
versities, the small college, it would
seem, must consent to be a doormat for
all time. But there is consolation for the

CKN'SK ISSUE.
Without belittling the long efforts of
the no-license advocates In the city of
Fall River, Mass., it nnist be admitted
that the inlluence of 1 Hilly" Sunday was
very potent toward swinging that city
from the "wet" to the "dry" column,
(ircat endeavors were aroused in that
city to secure a no-license majority, and
thereby the foundation whs laid for the
sweeping force of the Sunday personality
in one short but sharp drive. "Billy"
Sunday preachul nmy once in Fall River
and on that occaion ho directed all his
encre'e toward an excoriation of the
liiiim trallic, which he uid to the queen's
taste, or one might say, most completely
and most vehemently. Ho addressed a
great audience on that occasion and a
still greater audience when the news
papers printed their accounts of the
meeting. Much enthusiasm was stirred
up at the meeting and the enthusiasm
spread out in waves as the newspapers
performed their function of chronicling
the doings of the day. Everybody got
to talking about license or no-license;
and the result was that when the day
for voting came, about ii.O(H) more voters
turned out than had voted in the last
previous municipal election. A consider
able 'majority of the former stay-at-home
vote was no-license, and the city
changed into the "dry" regime. So
marked an overturn probably would not
have been possible had not the fiery en
thusiasm of "Billy" Sunday been brought
to bear.

MONOPOLY MAKES
HIC.H LIVING COST
Monopoly of Land, Railroads, Marketing
and Other Facilities, Declares Fred
erick C. Howe, Commissioner of Im
migration for Port of New York.
Chicago, Dee. 7. Private monopoly of
The land and the railroads and of trans
portation, marketing, warehouse, slaugh
tering and cold storage facilities, is re
I sponsible for the high cost of living, said
I Frederick ('. Howe, commissioner of itn
I migration of the port of New York, in an
I address this forenoon to the National
Conference on Marketing and Farm Cred
it. Mr. Howe's subject was, "The l'eo
plo and the Und: the Problem That
Cunfronts Is." Declaring that the high
cost of living has become a problem to
the people of America as well as to the
warring nations of Kurope and that the
solution hinges on the relation of the
people to the land, he said in part:
"The immigration problem is connect
ed with the land and is the biggest thing
to be oolved before the people, because
all wealth comes from the land. As long
a there was land in abundance, under
the homestead act, there was no serious
immigration problem, but now that the
land is all owneckthe immigration situa
tion has returned and now there is an
industrial problem also. The government
must turn to the land question, to agri
culture, to insure just treatment for
farmer and consumer alike.
"Some means must be found for open
ing the land to those who wish to pro
duce wealth on it. There are only HO
persons to the square mile in the United
States and a billion could live in Amer
ica comfortably if the boundless re
sources of the" continent were opened.
The first step in constructive immigra
tion is that adopted in western Canada
in encouraging farm improvements,
houses and growing crops by placing
taxes on the land alone. This would
break up the colossal estates into which
manv western states are divided. More
than' 200,000.000 of the SOO,OO0,flli0 acres
! ready for cultivation in the I nited
States are owned by less than oO.OOO
! persons. Millions of people could lie fur-
nished homes and profitable employment
j if the hand of speculation and monopoly
I were removed.
"I believe the government should pro
I vide ready-made farms to people of small
! means. This is the policy Denmark has
! adopted and 90 per cent of her farmers
own their farms. The government there
! supplies all but 10 per cent of the capital
and this the farmers furnish.
; "Transportation should be a public
j service and the government should own
i and control it in order to distribute im
' migrants' and other to the land. Such
service should, not be a private profit.
Marketing is now uncertain ami the
farmer is so despoiled by monopoly
' charges that he becomes discouraged and
often bankrupt."
In closing, Mr. Howe said the problem
of distribution was to get peoples back to
; the land under bearable conditions,
i "Unless a big constructive program is
; worked out," he said, "I expect to see
' agriculture become less profitable and
employ fewer people. Farmers and their
I sons will lc driven to the cities as has
! been the case in England. I expect to
! see the cost of living rise till the govern
! ment undertakes to get the people back
to the land."

Spaulding Defeated the Vincitia Club t
Basketball, 73 to 27.
Spaulding high school and the team
composed of Vincitia club men opened
the basketliall season in Barre last even
ing at the Spaulding gymnasium, when
the high school team swamped their old
er rivals by a score of 73 to 27. The high
school quintet far excelled their opponents
in every department of the game, show
ing better team work and having a bet
ter eye for the basket. This was duo to
the fact that the Vincitia team had not
had any practice, and therefore were not
in condition to meet a team which has
been under strict training during the
past month.
The floor work of Spaulding was very
good, but their strong feature is in shoot
ing baskets, the entire team being able
to cage the ball from nearly any angle
on the floor.
"Doc" Mann, the crafty forward of the
Spaulding team, excelled all in basket
shooting, and Geals of the same team
was a close second in the number of
times which he caged the ball. Hoar at
forward for the Vincitia team was the
top-notch scorer for his club, while Stu
art at guard played an aggressive game
and followed Hoar very closely in the
point getting. In the last period, Mac

General Sporting Notes.
After putting a team into shape which
could win from Holy Cross for the first
tinie in 17 years, Charley Hrickley, coach
of the Boston college football team,
has completed his duties at the school
for a while and left Tuesday for Penn
sylvania, where he will accept an oppor
tunity to advance in the coal business
by visiting a few mines in the Pennsyl
vania coal region, while on his vacation.
Hrickley is satisfied- with the showing
made by the team this year and is feel
ing good over the prospects for a fast
team next fall. It is significant that
Harvard's great dropkieker should b
able to impart his knowledge to others,
so that Johns Hopkins university could
win a championship by a drop kirk and
then whip Boston college into shape to
win by the same method.
People thought that when Eddie Col
lins started to slump last spring that
he had lost his hitting eye and that, as
a baseball player his days were over, but
he was swatting the ball well over .31X1
when the season finished. They all have
their slumps, but the good hitter, al
ways comes to his own. There comes a
time when they all slump and never
come back, but after the great gains
which Collins made during the last part
of the season, the baseball public is sura
of Collins' day being a long time ahead.
In figuring up the American leagui
fielding averages, it is found that th
Bed Sox lead the league in fieTding, wit!
"Scoot" Scott, the phenomenal short

team's fielding average for the season
was a percentage of .072. Manager Car

erage of 10(10 in 'ii games played, finori
en, who played in 33 games and Hen
drickaon, who played in 31 games during
the season were among the 1000 per
centage men. Only one regular third
baseman in the Wague led Larry Gardner,
that one being Vitt of Detroit, with an
average of .904, while Gardner fielded for
