ANOTHER ASTfiONOiUCAL LESSON
THE HERALD supposed its astronomical
lectures had closed with last Sundays
article on the moon A correspondent
however having the hardihood dispute
any claim of ours t scientific knowledge
on the subject comes forward in a commu
nication that we print elsewhere in which
he undertakes not only to knock Tun HER
ALDS theories into a cocked hat as it were
but to overturn ideas which have withstood
the test of centuries Our own discom
fiture might be submitted to with patience
but we hate to see all the other distin
guished astronomical authorities so rudely
tossed into the corner
Our correspondent who claims he has
the proofs to sustain him declares
1 Mans vision cannot roach beyond the
earths atmosphere which extends only
forty or fifty miles and therefore all
fft mies al we
see in the heavens must be within that dis
tance
2 What men think are the sun planets
and stars are only their reflections upon the
atmosphere of the earth
a Light is produced by ether waves from
these bodies reaching the earths atmos
phere and being subjected to friction by the
floating materials in the air
4 Tho earth is a hollow globe with the
sun in the centre all the celestial bodies
being Inside and all the nations of the
earth live the
lve on concave surface
5 The earth does not revolve but tho
sun moon and stars travel from east to
vest
That is about tho substance of our con
tributors essay and it will be seen ho re
inforces the opinion of the Rev Mr JAS
PER that the sun do move As to the
general theories advanced wo shall have
to do as Rip VAN WINKLE proposed in the
hypothetical case of his drowning wie
go homo and think about dat At first
blush it strikes us that if Prof SPEAR is
correct we havent near as much elbow
room as it was thought we had on this poor
little bit of a universe and it makes us feel
rather cooped up and confined in the inside
of our mustardseed of a world Here peo
ple have been digging and boring for cen
turies into the earths crust little knowing
that if they Trent far enough they would
reach the outside instead of the inside
It was only two or three weeks ago we
were startled by the statement on author
ity perhaps not so scientific as Professor
SPEAR that it is only fiftytwo rallies to
hell in a downward direction that being
the limit of the earths thickness Of
course these notions do not coincide any
more than SPEAR coincides with COPER
NICCS and so far as we know there is no
work on astronomy that locates the place
just referred to
Another thing and this is calculated to
make ono shudder I we are on the inside
of the earth and the earth doesnt revolve
wo are probally on the lower
probar1y projection
since we have to look upward to see the
heavenly bodies Now what if the plaster
ing should come down I Professor
SPEAR cannot answer this we would not
give 1 fig for his years of critical study
of modern philosophy and modern astro
nomy
MORE THOUBLE IN AKGENTINE
More trouble is brewing in the Argen
tine republic in the presidential elections
General ROCA the favorite of the specula
tors and nf the officials is the hwithnrJn
law of CELMAN who was president when
the revolution of last year broke out and
who wis forced to resign on account of the
financial chaos that reigned throughout the
country ROCA is now minister of the in
terior Dr PELLEGRINI becoming presi
dent in August 1890 by
having been
vicepresident under ROCA The opponent
of General Rocs General MITRE the old
est general in the
army being seventy
three Ho was president for five years
from 1S63 to 1S6S and during this pericd
also there was a serious financial panic
He is said to be popular with the
army and the masses of the people
The troubles in Argentine illustrate
what monetary mismanagement
will
wi bring I
a contry to They have all been brought I
on by maladministration of the
maladministraton countrys
finances and it seems too that what are
called cetiulas have had a good deal to do
with it Cedulas are notes issued
by auth
ority of the government by the Buenos
Ayres Mortgage bank and the National
Natonal
Mortgage bank on farms and land being
similar to the notes proposed in the bill
offered in our Congress by Senator STAN
FORD of California
Calfornia The government
authorized the banks to issue these notes
securad by first mortgages on farms and
land to the amount of nnohnlf their iolim
the government taking the bonds and al
lowing the banks to put out notes to their
full face value
Of course it was a wild and
a wid dangerous
scheme I was first put in operation eight
or ten years ago and was for a time very
popular as tho notes were plentiful
plentiul and
everyone had his share of them But the
volume of cedulas rose from 110000000 in
1SS6 to 275000000 in 1SSS and a
5COOOO year after
to 404000000 This for a
G400Oo country whose
population is not more than four millions
was an excessive supply of paper money
I that was practically irredeemable Gold
and silver left the
sier country the
paper
money fell from one stage to another till
it was worth only 2 cents on the dollar
prices of all things went up in proportion
proporton
business became disordered and a revolt
of the army and navy backed by
a large
part of the population of the capital seemed
to be if not the only way the shortest way
out of the trouble The inauguration of
PELLEGRINIS government for a time
averted complete disaster but the spirit of
revolt ic stilt mnnl prinr and mnr hA1
0 J u
out immediately
The lesson the
Argentine government
teaches is that no
country however
pros
perous can safely depart from gold and
silver as the basis of its monetary system
Lands farms and other property have
their values but they are not transferable
from hand to band nor convertible into
one another like precious metal coins Nor
can aotes issued on them
possess tho
same
stablo unvarying value as notes exchange
able into coin A
country can safely
use
all the gold and silver i can get and the
more it has the better but it cannot sub
stitute inconvertible paper for them with
out inviting financial ruin
STRANGE ERROR
I
The San Francisco Examiner prints a
dispatch from Los Angeles pointing out a
curious blunder in the
curous Presidents message
II
in reference to the Itata case evincing
most remarkable ignorance
ignorance Instead o a
decision having been
rendered in this case
and on appeal hairier been taken tha nnl
decisions have been on the Robert and
Minnie matter and in the
r criminal
mat prose
cution of TRUMBCLL and BURT The Los I
Angales telegram adds
I is probable that Mr HARRISON refers to I
the opinion in the Trumbull cases but
Trumbul cases even j I
I
there Judge Ross while
expressing a doubt as
to whether a mere insurgent could be
ter coud prose
cuted under the neutrality statute expressly
declined to decide the mo Jon mane upon that
ground but based his judgment upon the merits tat
and issue in accordance with a uniform line of
adjudications commencing before the close of
the last century and continuing unbroken up to
date I
As to tho assertion that an appeal has been
taken It need only be said that not only has no
appeal been rerfected or attempted ia the
I Trumbell case hut no such proceeding can ever
be had The defendants having been acquitted
the government cannot appeal There is hardly
a basis for any of ihe assertions made i this
matter by Mr HARRISON
J BEIGHA31 YOUNG STATUE
I
The action taken last week regarding the
1 erection of a statue to the memory of
BRIGUAM YOUNG will TIE HERALD is cer
tain call forth the hearty approval of the
community in general The proposition is
to erect a bronze statue of heroic size on a I
granite base the expense to be met by pop
ular subscription It is expected that the I
cost will be not less than 25000 and it
may considerably exceed that sum as def
inate estimates have not yet been obtained I
There was a time when the project might
not have secured the support of a portion
of the community but the fourteen years
since BRIGHAJU YOUNG died have changed
this and today all citizens of Utah with
out regard to religion or politics recognize
him as the founder and builder of this
commonwealth Those who were opposed
to and disliked him in his lifetime now
concede that he was a great man to whom
Utah and the mighty west will forever be
indebted for the work that ho did For all
time his name will be associated with the
early history of the territory and his
memory will be revered by tho people as
they read the story of hIs life as the
pioneer organizer and commonwealth
builder
I is observed that the Mormons have
takeu this matter of tho statue in hand
the committees wo boliove all being made
up with members of the church This is
proper enough as BRIGUAJI YOUNG was
everything to the Mormon people At the
same time we dont understandand hope
it is not the casethat the monument is to
be erected and paid for within the Mormon
church Whilst in his lifetime he was the
Mormon leader he was also the founder of
Utah and as such his memory belongs to
all the people THE HEUALD knows many
I Gentiles who would esteem it a pleasure to
have part and interest in the proposed
j statue and we believe that the prevailing
sentiment among nonMormons is that the
subscription list should bo open to all that
the work when completed may belong to
the public and not to a church class
GETTING USE
The President grows in antisilver fanat
icism as ho gets older In his message last
week he is more pronounced in his opposi
tion to the white metal than ever before
and more reckless in his assertions with
which to back up his opinion For in
stance ho says that i free coinage of sil
ver were permitted the effect would be
disastrous to our business interests at
home and abroad and continues We
could not hope to maintain an equality in
the purchasing power of the gold and silver
ver dollar in our own markets aud in the
foreign trade the stamp gives no added
value to the bullion contained in coins j
I
The producers of the country and its
farmers and laborers have tho highest in
terest that every dollar in paper or coin
issued by the government shall be as good
as any other I there is one less valua
ble than the other its sure and constant
errand will be to pay them less for their
toils and their crops I
For a good many years since 1S7S until
the present law went into effect the gov I
nh L d
UUCU UUcU uu ress tnan two
mUlon
silver dollars a month and during all that
time the silver dollar has preserved just as
great purchasing power as the gold dollar
I has done this in spite of the fact that
the market value of the silver in the dollar
has ranged from 93 cents in 1S7S to i cents
in 1SS9 Since the existing statute went
into operation the government has been
issuing silver certificates redeemable in
coined dollars and therefore the equivalent
of coin in exchange for 4500000 ounces of
sliver per month These certificates are
worth just 100 cents on the dollar in every
store in the country although tho I
bullion value of the silver which
they stand in the place of
is worth considerably less than a
hundred cents During all these years tho
gold in a gold dollar has been worth 100
cents the mint stamp not affecting the
value simply the
giving piece currency as
money instead of leaving it a commercial
commodity to be weighed by every dealer
into whose hands it fell
Now i the purchasing power of the gold
and silver dollars in our markets has not
been changed although from two to four
and a half millions of silver dollars have
been issued every month for the past
thirteen years what reason is there for
nin tlt tho hnn L
g AUb Ug 1 UUU lluyer or tne
silver dollars will be lessened by free
coinage Will the issuance of moro of
these dollars bearing the mint impress de
crease the purchasing power I so how
many more must be issued to cause the de
crease of buying power
When tho President finds in circulation
any dollars which are worth less than
other dollars he will do well to oppose the
issuance of any more of the deficient coin
He would then have ground for argument
Now ho has none in his opposition silver
save his belief founded on no practical
demonstration whatever that i silver
were coined for the owners instead of for
the government its purchasing power
would be lessened I
THERE ABE in this territory hundreds
and thousands of women who have borne
the relation of polygamous wives and tho
worst enemies to the Mormon religion
never thought of reflecting upon the char I
acters of these women or suggesting that
they were unchaste Whatever may have I I
been thoulht nf thpll h1hni 1 + hnu
u
motives actuating tho latter the purity
and honesty of the Mormon wives have
never been called in question their virtue
and rectitude being conceded by all It
remained for the President of tho United
States to class these women with the vie
creatures who infest tho national capital
and it remained for the Republican or
Republcan organs
and politicians in Utah to indorse and ap
plaud that message As human nature is
the same the world over THE HERALD as
sumes that these slandered women ana
their sons will not forget their traducers

RAILWAY PROGRESS
I
The Increase of the Miles of Track laid In
This Country
Taking 1830 as the real starting point of
the American railway system there being
at that time a comparatively few miles of
rail laid and only two roads on which loco
motive engines were running the railway
statistics of 1S90 demonstrate not only the
phenomenal growth of tho railroads in the
United States but tho enterprise energv
and liberality of those who have built and
operated them On December 31 last the
aggregate railway mileage of this country
was lboS1741
But it is not this vast mileage nearly or
quite equal to that of the rest of the civ
Hired world that best shows the growth
of the railway system of America That
is to be largely seen in the improvement of
the roadeach part of which Is being made
as stront RR thA RtrnnD < tnt tho nUn
switches signals l of theappllancesfor O in
suring safety comfort or luxury and great
speed
The celebration of any eventful incident
of the railroad movement in the United
States could not be more fitly observed
i than by the Pennsylvania company which
has carried tho system to the highest
standard of efficiency thus reached either
I here or abroad
When indeed the complete history of
the railways of this country comes to be
adequately written it will contain no more
illustrious names than those of somo of the
presidents Ice presidents engineers and
other officers of this company who did so
much to develop the ideas which hvans
Foulton and Stevens evolved and so
earnestly urged upon the attention of their
countrymen
The railway system of the United States
is not yet in respect of any of its lines
perfect but it is being perfected in almost
every desirable particular and especially
in the essential particulars of safety com
fort and speed Philadelphia Ledger

RAIN PRODUCED AT WILL By Louis Gain
mann Chicago
This Is the elaboration of the theory ad
vanced by Prof Gathmann that rain can
be produced by the explosion of Rates at
great elevations His claim is that by
liberating highly compressed gases in the
upper regions the temperature of the at
at

Leaving beautiful Venice on an afternoon
we arrived in three hours in old Verona I
We could not spare the time to visit this i i
ancient city but ourtrain stopped half an I
hour andwe had a good view of tho place I I
from the cars Verona is noted for its an
cent buildings among which is the great i i t
Amphitheatre with seats for 20000 people
whore gladiator fights were held as early
as the second century Verona is also the
scene of Shakespeares Romeo and I
Juliet and the tomb is shown to visitors i I i
who leave their cards there The modern city I
forms one of four points in tho renowned i
square of fortifications cut through by the
Adigo river
rver
From Verona we went to Ala passing
Padua where the ancient university is sit
uated across the Italian Tyroleso frontier
changing cars for another unpleasant
search by the custom officers and in half
an hour more we were in Triente where
we spent the night Triente is a most
beautiful Alpine resort and as I stepped out
upon tho balcony to watch the exercise ot
a platoon of soldiers below the hotel on a
square surrounded by mighty mountains I
was almost overcome with the grandeur of
the view
Americans only see in our country the
fruit venders and organ grinders of Italy
but Italian life among the upper classes is
as in other nations of Europe quite another
thing Tho language is sweeter than any
other and the women the mOst beautiful
outside of America We left Trent at 5 a
m for
MUNICH THE CAPITAL OF BAVARIA
We got off at Kuffstein to get some edel
weis the native flower of the Alps Fare
well to sunnyltaly We arrived in Munich
at 5 pm and had time to dress and go to
the Court Opera house where we witnessed
Nessleis lrompeter voc Sackingen by
one of the best German stock companies
Especially fine was the ballet I
Municn is still another city full of inter
est and it is often called the IsarAthens
or the Athens on the mar river on account
rver
of the numerous monuments galleries and L
public institutions many built in clasic
style Munich is chiefly indebted to King
Ludwig I for her beauty and wealth of art
collections He was inn founder of the old
and new Pinakotheks and the Glyptothek i
THE PINAKOTHEK I j
contain paintings of the old and the new I
masters respectively and the collections
are among the finest in Germany Among
the modern paintings we especially admired L
Kaulbachs Christ Healing the Side and I
Pilotys Wallenstein found dead by the
Astrologist Soul
The Glyptothek has a rich collection of j
sculptural works among them some very i
famous nntfmm t nieces nf the Greek Tf
mans and Egyptians tho sleeping satyr
Diana a statue of Alexander tho ijr
Mercury putting on sandals etc besides
many pieces of modern times
The Rubmeshalle Hal of glory built
also by King Ludwig I contains the stat
ues of great Bavarians artists scientists
and generals In front of this building
stands tho statue of the Bavaria which
is about sixtythree feet high and was
modeled by the great Schwanthaler An
imitation of the Greek original are The
Propylaes a marble gate built by
Ludwig 1 at a cost ot 730000 florins to cele
brate the recreation of the Greek kingdom
The day after the opening of the gate the
Kings son Otto I returned from Greece
driven away by his subjects after a reign
of thirty years
The victory gate built after the model of
the arch of triumph of Constantine is also
a creation of Ludwig I
We viewed the sleighs and carriages of
King Ludwig II
THE CRAZY FULER OF BAVARIA
A small admission fee is charged which
goes toward paying the debts accumulated
form the fantastic and extravagant fancies
of Ludwig He had one carriage made for
his sister when she was married which is
of gold with crystal lamps white ostrich
plumes etc
The King only drove out at night through
the country oy electric lights and in fantas
tic attire The footmen stood on velvet
pedestals and shoes of the same material
m ifi tnt tli fonf nP the rlrivRiv The
seats in the vehicles were made of blue
silk plush emoroidered in gold tinsel and
trimmed with golden lace Tho lap robes
are of Hermelin fur His carriage was
generally preceded by eight wiiite horses
each bearing a rider dressed fantastically
and with a light in his hand
The royal palace is very interesting It
contains one sleeping room with a bed of
which
THE CURTAINS ALONE COST 800000 FLORINS
The kings appreciation of the beauty of
women is shown in the two Schoenheiton
cabinete cabinet of beauties Wherever
Ludwig saw a beautiful women without
regard to her rank or stat on he hud ncr
come to the castle to bo painted and the
painting was then hung in these rooms
therefore the walls are covered with the
pictures of beautiful women I saw the
face of Helene Sedlmeyer the daughter of
a shoemaker beside that of the Countess
Beust and other high born ladies
There is another place where a real aem
ocratic spirit prevails especially on a Sun
day afternoon and that is the brewery
where the well known Bavarian beer is
made There are many of these in the city
and they are doing a tremendous business
Men and women of all classes crowd
I h
fluid from mugs containing one liter each
Sometimes the crowds number ten to
twelve thousand in one brewery and are so
dense that it is impossible to have enough
help to wait upon them In this case they
fall into line and
MARCH TO THE PLOWING HOGSHEADS
where they fill their glasses then hand
twenty pfenning to the man standing by and
return to their tables
The quantity of beer drunk in Munich ia
astonishing and amounts to about four
hundred liters a year on the average for
each inhabitant man woman or child and
as the infant is not supposed to drink its
share we may imagine that the adults con
sume more A liter is equal to about a
quart
It is worth a trip to the Automatic mu
seum to see besides other numerous things
the stomach of a Bavarian peasant who
drank twentyfour liters of beer every day
for many years Now my readers must
not form a false impression of the German
people on account of their beer drinking
proclivities The fluid is pure and whole
some and is commonly prescribed by physl
clans even to children for nourishment ant
I have never seen a drunken man on the
streets Indeed even the American likes
10 join me ueruiaus m mu uuowauuiau ui
other resorts and in this respect is soon
Germanized There is always a good bane
in these gardens for to the Gorman
MUSIC IS AS ESSENTIAL AS BEER
and it must bo good music too Vary re
markable is the preference of the German
for heavy music The old Italian master
cannot attract large audiences at the opera
and Wagner reigns supreme It is not her
that the musician alone knows what mnsl
is but every other man you meet has an
educated ear
And they know too how to put Wagner
on the stage Indeed I am a crank wit
the rest of them and join always the en
tinaslastic crowd whenever a Wagner opera
is being played There are people her
who never miss a Wagner opera and I have
actually met some who have beard Lohen
gIn over fifty tIm Winers ia ng
I 1 longer l tho music of the future but of the
present and even the Italian now models
after him and I see by American papora
that our famous bands also gives him lead
ing place in their programmes
WAGNER HIMSELF
was a rather crazy genius and it was fort
unate for him that he was thrown in con
tact with a genius still more crazy than he
to wit King Ludwig II before mentioned
as the crazy ruler of Bavaria
It Ties through the Kings admiration for
the music of Wagner and the heroes ha
created that Wacner was better able finan
cially to make his way Above all the
King admired Lohengrin so much that ia
one of his several castles be bad an artific
Let lake made and put a boat in it which
was drawn by a swan the same as it ap
pears in the opera Louis dressed himself
as Lohengrin and rode upon the lake in the
manner of the hero of mythology The
most luxurious of ho Kings castles is the
Herrencniemsee located in the Cbiem lake
and built after the model of the castle of
Versailles but it surpasses the latter in
splendor The state bed room ia the grand
est room in the castle One Hungarian who
visited it said I must kneel in the pres
ence of such grandeur This room is
supposed to have no equal in the world and
its value cannot be estimated Such a
room could be built only by a King and only
by a King w ith tho genius of Ludwig The
most elegant thing in the room is the bed
which is heavily gilded and ornamented
with wood sculptures and medallions The
furniture in the room cost almost a million
There is also a mirror gallery two hundred
and fiftytwo feet long and thirtfive feet
wideand fortythree feet high and contain
any number of mirrors The furniture ia
lilies agreeable to the coat of arms of tbs
former French royal family
Ludwigs admiration for the French was
very peculiar and ho tried in every way to
1 1 imitate i Louis XVI who was his ideal and
ho never passed his statue in his court yard
without bowing VERONA POLLOCK

A PRETTY GIRLS PLAN
To Be Bid of the Too Numerous and Too
Ardent Swain
One Lewiston girl believes that prayer
meetings are not the place for flirtations
and pairing off She has known what it is I
j to 1 expect one or two men waiting at the
church i door every Sunday night with the
question i whether or not be may go homo
i with her She has determined to rid her
self of both and probably has She went
to the cakewalk in Lyceum ball Saturday
night and during the evening both ashen
permission to escort her home She said
yes to both They both waited for her on
the landing and when sbecamo down stairs
she smiled and took ono of each young
mans arms
At first they hesitated a little but then
went down the last flight of stairs at a
jerky gait At the foot of the stairs they
both let go her arm ana walked up Lisbon
street looking ugly at each other She
entertained them both with lively stories
of the evenings entertainment Each
thought that the other would drop off at
the haad of the street and he would go
home with the pretty girl but no they
both went on up Main street wishing in 1
their inmost hearts that they were out of
jit What a fool the other fellow weal
Why didnt he leave
In the meantime they went past corner
after corner where each thought surely
the other would say Rood night for had
not the girl said he might go home with
her So on they went until the gate was
reached and with a pretty thought about
the effect of the moon on the dried leaves
in the gutter she asked them both in
They both said it was late and looked ner
me Thursday evening she asked
Mamma would be pleased to meet you
One said he had an engagement at the
store that night and the other said he was
going out of town
I Thursday After a mo
j I ment during which each thought It was
I time for the other to move on the young
lady said good night and went up the steps
I No one annoyed her Sunday night when
she came out of prayer meeting Lewiaton
