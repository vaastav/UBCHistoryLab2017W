PHOENIX, ARIZONA,
There are hundreds of men in. this
city who are living up 'to the full ex
tent of their incomes
"WOULDN'T every day. They save
THIS nothing. They aocum-
JAR YOU? ulate nothing. No pro
vision is being made
for the future of themselves or their
' families. Tftey are peons, and the
worst of it Is .they seem saitlsfled with
their lot. In what particular are they
any -tetter off, any better citizens, or
deserving of any more consideration
than the poor Indian whom they des
pise? They may 'be Industrious, but so
Is the Indian. They may be loyal and
patriotic, but so Is "poor Lo." About
-the only difference Is that their skin is
white, and they are not responsible for
that. Why not use a little common
sense la the management of affairs?
There Is absolutely no reasonable ex
cuse for a -man In- good health, and
who Is getting a regular salary, no
matter how small, not -saving a portion
of it. If he receives fifty dollars per
-month he wlfl save less than if he
receives one hundred, tut he can, if he
'will, save some. .
But money can be saved only by close
economy, -by many self-denials. Yet.
when we stop to consider how the mon
ey goes, there are many, many things
that we constantly tuy that w? don't
really need -that we would be just as
well oft without. If a small leak could
be stopped here, a slight expense lop
ped oft there, and an expensive hutolt
stopped how and then. It would be sur
prising to find how many dollars could
be -aecumulateu in a year.
Why ehould a man pay rent when he
can buy a home on the Installment
plan without the expenditure or an ex
tra dollar? Two men start out in bus
iness together. One ' buiys his home,
paying one hundred dollars down, and
twenty-five dollars per month. At the
end of five years he owns his home,
worth, by the Increase In values, per
haps twice or three 'times what it cost.
The ickher man pays rent at twenty
five dollars per month. At the end of
five years he is out $1,500, with nothing
to show for It.
Which is the wiser man? "

the coarssst language General Miles,
his official superior and chle-f in com

course, subversive of all discipline, and
a cause of humiliation to every officer
in the service. His abusive epithets
were deliberately framed, and were re

would be difficult to site an equally
disgraceful exhibition by any army of

the service. The sentence was severe,

ROCKEFELLER'S FORTUNE.
The Figures Are Astonishing, But
Some Respects Deceptive.
in
Congressman Jefferson M. Levi, of
New York, is reported to have offered
Rockefeller $400,000 for 500 shares of
Standard Oil stock. This valuation ap
plied to the tota? holdings of Standard
Oil places Rockefeller's wealth in that
property alone at about $266,000,';Q3.
in addition to this he has large '.ii.'er
ests In other directions, so ihat it is
impossible to measure accurately his
entire fortune. Within the last year,
however, the advance in the market
value of his Standard Oil stock n'.me
has increased his wealth $95,000,000 or
so, while his annual income in divl-

dends , from that stock is about
$16,000,000.
Such astonishing figures go far to
prove that the Standard Oil magnate is
the richest man in the world. They
are deceiving, however, in a s?nse. Mr.
Rockefeller has no such accumulation
of money as that, nor could he have.
Any effort to convert those holJings
into money or Into other forms of prop
erty would "bear" the market and ma
terially reduce the value. The estim
ate is actually based on the earning
power of his property, calculating the
capital value according to the current
rate of interest. The lower the rate

The prophecy that such a fortune

writings continually calls attention lo

of this country, and the fact that by
force of nature the development must
be along agricultural lines, virtually
ascurlng that the country must be rel
atively poor, and that great fortunes
could hardly be accumulated this, to3,
when $1,000,000 would have been con

THE MAKING OF ALMANACS.
The Weather Prophets Generally Work
on the "Cycle" Theory.
"Speaking of almanac predictions a3
compared to weather bureau forecasts"
said a veteran d'rug man of this city,
"every almanac prophet has a secret
system of his own. There are less than
a dozen in the country who are regard
ed as experts, and, as far as I know,
their caleula-iiions are all based on the
'cycle' theory. They assume, in other
words, that :t:he weather repeats itself
at certain intervals. Where they dif
fer is in the length of the cycle. There
was a main in Ohio who was very suc
cessful for a long time, and whro. took
half a century as the basis of his sys-t-em.
He was employed to get up tthi
predictions for almanacs issued by a
large wholesale drug house in Detroit,
and in 1885 or 1886 I am net quite cer
tain of the tla'te he created a sensation
by the accuracy of his forecast. He
was far more successful than the gov
ernment weather bureau of that day,
and ,of course, he acquired an immense
prestige. Next year Wis percentage of
m-isses was much greater, but he made
one astonishing hit in predicting a phe
nomenally cold wave that arrived ex
actly according to his schedule. It 13
a great pity he tiiidn't retire at once on
his laurels, for he never) duplicated
those early performancss, and finally
went sro far astray that he had to ciult
the business.
"The mcjit scientific of the almanac
forecasters estimate their cycles by
certain astronomical conditions. They
go on the 'theory that the relative po
sition of the plane'ts has something to
do with the weather, anU they have a
set of carefully prepared astronomical
maps for each year. When the condi
tions are identical they assume that the
wea'Jher will be about the same. Some
go further and claim that comets and
sun spoits produce tornadoes and other
great disturbances. I dare say the late
total eclipse has played a promintnt
part in more -than one set c-f predictions
throughout the country. But, as a rule,
the almanac men fight shy of announc
ing great changes. Country people
have a habit of treasuring up blundeis
of that kind, and one or two of !ihem
will ruin the reputation cf a publica
tion. As a rule the predfictions are
generalities, dealing with th-s average
weather of a section, and in tha-tj re
spect the cycle theory seems to be pret
ty reliable. You, would be surprised to
know how many 'weather almanacs'
circulate among the country folk. The
average edition cf any of ;ihe older pub
lications is never less than a milliim.
