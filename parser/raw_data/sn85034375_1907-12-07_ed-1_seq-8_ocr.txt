He quotes at length from his mes
sage of last year in which he advo
cated federal control of corporations
doing interstate business, and believes
that in such control would be found the
and

remedy for
stock speculation which he believes
have brought about the present finan
cial conditions. He says:
"Our steady aim should be by legis
lation, cautiously and carefully under
taken. but resolutely persevered in, to
assert the sovereignty of the national
government by affirmative action.
"This is only in form an innovation.
In substance it Is merely a restoration;
for from the earliest time such regula
tion of industrial activities has been
recognized in the action of the law
making bodies^ nnd all that 1 propose
is to meet the changed conditions in
•uch manner as will prevent the com
monwealth abdicating the power it has
always possessed, not only in this coun
try. but also in England before and
•ince this country became a separate
nation.
Federal Control of
Railroads I* Favored.
•
"No small part of the trouble that we
have comes from carrying to an ex
treme the national virtue of self-re
liance, of independence In initiative
and action. It is wise to conserve this
virtue and to provide for its fullest ex
ercise, compatible with seeing that lib
erty does not become a liberty to
wrong others. Unfortunately, this is
the kind of liberty that the lack of all
effective regulation inevitably breeds.
The founders of the constitution pro
vided that the national government
should have complete and sole control
of interstate commerce. There was
then practically no interstate business
save such as was conducted by water,
and this the national government at
once proceeded to regulate in thorough
going and effective fashion. Condi
tions have now so wholly changed that
the interstate commerce by water is in
significant compared with the amount
that goes by land, and almost all big
business concerns are now engaged in
interstate commerce. As a result, it
can be but partially and imperfectly
controlled or regulated by the action of
any one of the several states; such ac
tion inevitably tending to be either too
drastic or else too lax, and in either
case Ineffective for purposes of justice.
Only the national government can in
thoroughgoing fashion exercise the
needed control. This does not mean
that there should be any extension of
federal authority, for such authority
already exists under the constitution in
amplest and most far-reaching form;
but it does mean that there should be
an extension of federal activity. This
is not advocating centralization. It is
merely looking facts in the face, and
realizing that centralization in business
has already come and can not be avoid
ed or undone, and that the public at
large can only protect itself from cer
tain evil effects of this business cen
tralization by providing better methods
for the exercise of control through the
authority already centralized in the
national government by the constitu
tion itself. There must be no halt in
the healthy constructive course of ac
tion which this nation has elected to
pursue, and has steadily pursued, dur
ing the last six years, as shown both in
the legislation of the congress and the
administration of the law by the de
partment of Justice. The most vital
need is in connection with the railroads.
A* to these, in my Judgment there
should now be either a national incor
poration act or a law licensing railway
companies to engage in interstate com
merce upon certain conditions. The law
should be so framed as to give to the
Interstate commerce commission power
to pass upon the future issue of securi
ties, while ample means should be pro
vided to enable the commission, when
ever In its judgment it is necessary, to
make a physical valuation of any rail
road. Ar I" stated in my message to the
congress a year ago, railroads should
M* given power to enter; into agree
ments, ikibject ta these agreements be
ing made publlo in minute detail and to
the consent of the Interstate commerce
commission being first obtained,
the national government assume*
proper control of interstate commerce,
iu the exercise of the authority It al
ready possesses, it will be Impossible
either to give to or to get from the
railroads full Justice. The railroads
and all other great corporations will
do well to recognize that this control
must come; the only question Is as to
what governmental body can most
wisely exercise it. The courts will de
termine the limits within which the
federal authority can exercise it, and
there will still remain ample work
within each state for the railway com
mission of that state; and the national
interstate commerce commission will
work in harmony with the several state
commissions, each within its own prov
ince, to achieve the desired end.
Control of Interstate
Husiuea* Concern* Urged.
"Moreover, in my Judgment there should
be additional legislation looking to the
proper control of the great business con
cerns engaged in Interstate business, tills
control to be exercised for their own
benefit and prosperity no less than for
the protection of investors and of the
general public. As I have repeatedly
said in messages to congress and else
where, experience has definitely shown
not merely the unwisdom but the futility
of endeavoring to put a stop to all busi
ness combinations. Modern industrial
conditions are such that combination '«*
not only necessary but inevitable. It '+s
so in the world of business just as it \a
so in the world of labor, and It is as idlo.
to desire to put an end to all corpora
tions, to all big combinations of capital,
as to desire to put an end to combina
tions of labor. Corporation avd labor
union alike have come to staj.Each if
properly managed is a source of good
and not evil. Whenever in either there
is evil, it should be promptly held to ac
count; but it should receive hearty en
couragement so long as it is properly
managed. It is profoundly immoral to
put or keep on the statute books a law,
nominally in the interest of public morul
ity, that really puts a premium upon
public immorality, by undertaking to
forbid honest men from doing what must
be done under modern business condi
tions, so that the law itself provides that
its own infraction must be the condition
precedent upon business success. To aim
at the accomplishment of too much usu
ally means the accomplishment of too lit
tle, and often the doing of positive dam
age.
"The antitrust law should not bo re
pealed; but it should be made both more
efficient and more in harmony with act
ual conditions. It should be so amended
as to forbid only the kind of combination
which does harm to the general public,
such amendment to be accompanied by,
or to be an incident of, a grant of su
pervisory power to the government over
these big corporations engaged in inter
state business. This should be accom
panied by provision for the compulsory
publication of accounts and the subjec
tion of books and papers to the inspec
tion of the government officials. A be
ginning has already been made for such
supervision by the establishment of the
bureau of corporations.
"The antitrust law should not prohibit
combinations that do no injustice to the
public, still less those the existence of
which is on the whole of benefit to the
public. But even if this feature of the
law were abolished, there would remain
as an equally objectionable feature the
difficulty and delay now incident to its
enforcement. The government must now
submit to irksome and repeated delays
before obtaining a final decision of the
courts upon proceedings instituted, and
even a favorable decree may mean an
empty victory. Moreover, to attempt to
control these corporations by lawsuits
means to impose upon both the depart
ment of justice and the courts an im
possible burden; it is not feasible to carry
on more than a limited number of such
suits. Such a law to be really effective
must of course be administered by an
executive body, and not merely by means
of lawsuits. The design should be to
prevent the abuses incident to the crea
tion of unhealthy and improper combina
tions. instead of waiting until they are
in existence and then attempting to de
stroy them by civil or criminal proceed
ings.
Investing Public Should
Be Amply Safeguarded.
"The congress has the power to charter
corporations to engage in interstate and
foreign commerce, and a general law can
be enacted under the provisions of which
existing corporations could take out fed
eral charters and new federal corpora
tions could be created. An essential pro
vision of such a law should be a method
of predetermining by some federal board
or commission whether the applicant for
a federal charter was an association or
combination within the restrictions of the
federal law. Provision should also be
made for complete publicity in all matters
affecting the public and complete protec
tion to the investing public and the share
holders in the matter of issuing corporate
securities. If an incorporation law is not
deemed advisable, a license act for big
interstate corporations might be enacted;
or a combination of the two might be
tried. The supervision established might
be analogous to that now exercised over
national banks. At least, the antitrust
act should be supplemented by specific
prohibitions of the methods which ex
perience has shown have been of most
service in enabling monopolistic combina
tions to crush out competition. The real
owners of a corporation should be com
pelled to do business in their own name.
The right to hold stock in other corpora
tions should heareafter be denied to inter
state corporations, unless on approval by
the proper government officials, and a
prerequisite to such approval should be
the listing with the government of
owners and stockholders, both by the
corporation owning such stock and by
the corporations in which such stock ia
owned.
"To confer upon the national govern
ment, In connection with the amendment
I advocate In the antitrust law, power of
supervision over big business concerns
engaged in interstate commerce, would
benefit them as it has benefited the na
tional banks. In the recent business
crisis it is noteworthy that the institu
tions which failed were institutions
which were not under the supervision and
control of the national government.
Those which were under national con
trol stood the test.
"National control of the kind above ad
vocated would be to the benefit of every
well-managed railway. From the stand
point of the public there Is need for ad
ditional tracks, aditional te rminals. and
improvements in the actual handling of
the railroads, and all this as rapidly as
possible. Ample, safe, and spei dy tre/vs
portatlon facilities are even more neces
sary than cheap transportation. There
fore, there is need for the Investment of
money which will provide for all these
things while at the same time securing as
fas as is possible better wages and
shorter hours for their employe! There
fore, while there must be just *.nd rea
sonable regulation of rates, we snould be
the first to protest against any arbitrary
and unthinking movement to cut ttjem
down without the fullest and most care
ful consideration of all interests con
cerned and of me actual needs ef the
situation. Only a special body of men
acting for the national government un
der authority conferred upon it by th*
congress Is competent to pass judgment
on such a matter.
Greater Elasticity la
Currency I* Urged.
The president quotes extensively from
hi* last message ia dealing with the 41*
Until
a U I
I
I
ijt
■ /.
rect subject of currency legislation, and
says:
"I again urge on the congress the need
of immediate attention to this matter.
We need a greater elasticity In our cur
rency; provided, of course, that we recog
nize tho even grenter need of a safe and
secure currency. There must always be
the most rigid examination by the na
tional authorities. Provision should be
made for an emergency currency. The
emergency Issue should, of course,
made with an effective guaranty, and up
on conditions carefully prescribed by the
government. Such emergency issue must
be based on adequate securities approved
by the government, and must be issued
under a heavy tax. This would permit
currency being Issued when th® demand
for It was urgent, while securing Its re
tirement as the demand fell off. It is
worth investigating to determine whether
offerers and directors of national banks
should ever be allowed to loan to them
selves. Trust companies should b® sub
ject to the same supervision as banks;
legislation to this effect should be en
acted for the District of Columbia and
the territories.
"Yet we must also'remember that even
the wisest legislation on the subject can
only accomplish a certain amount. No
legislation can by any possibility guar
antee the business community against the
results of speculative folly any more than
it can guarantee an individual against the
results of his extravagance. When an in
dividual mortgages his house to buy an
automobile he invites disaster; and when
wealthy men, or men who pose as such,
or are unscrupulously or foolishly eager
to become such, indulge in reckless spec
ulation—especially if it is accompanied by
dishonesty—they jeopardize not only their
own future but the future of all their in
nocent fellow-citizens, for they expose
the whole business community to panic
and distress."
He advises against any general tariff
legislation this session of congress, and
says:
"In a country of such phenomenal
growth as ours It is probably well that
every dozen years or so the tariff laws
should be carefully scrutinized so as to
see that no excessive or improper bene
fits are conferred thereby, that proper
and that our
encouraged. There
be as a minimum
will not only al
low for the collection of an ample rev
enue but which will at least make
good the difference in cost of production
here and abroad; that is. the difference in
the labor cost here and abroad, for the
well-being of the wage-worker must ever
be a cardinal point of American policy.
The question should be approached pure
ly from a business standpoint; both the
time and the manner of the change being
such as to arouse the minimum of agi
tation and disturbance in the business
world, and to give the least play for
selfish and factional motives. The sole
consideration should be to see that the
sum total of changes represent the pub
lic good. This means that the subject
cannot with wisdom be dealt with in the
year preceding a presidential election, be
cause as a matter of fact experience has
conclusively shown that at such a time
It Is Impossible to get men to treat It from
the standpoint of the public good. In my
judgment the wise time to deal with the
matter Is immediately after such elec
tion."
He asks for the repeal of the tariff on
paper and wood pulp.
He reviews and enlarges upon his pre
vious recommendations for the enact
ment of federal Inheritance and income
tax laws.
Attention is called to the prosecution of
wealthy offenders against the national
laws, and In this connection he asks that
the laws under which these prosecutions
are brought be strengthened and made
more definite.
The Use nnd the
Abuse of Injunction*.
be
revenue is provided,
foreign trade is
must always
a tariff which
"Instances of abuse in the granting of
Injunctions in labor disputes continue to
occur, and the resentment in the minds
of those who feel that their rights are
being invaded and their liberty of action
and of speech unwarrantably restrained
continues to grow. Much of the attack
on the use of the process of injunction is
wholly without warrant; but I am con
strained to express the belief that for
some of it there is warrant. This ques
tion is becoming more and more of prime
importance, and unless the courts will
themselves deal with It in effective man
ner, It Is certain ultimately to demand
some form of legislative action. It would
be most unfortunate for our social wel
fare if we should permit many honest
and law-abiding citizens to feel that
they had just cause for regarding our
courts with hostility. I earnestly com
mend to the attention of the congress
this matter, so that some way may be
devised which will limit the abuse of in
junctions and protect those rights which
from time to time it unwarrantably In
vades. Moreover, discontent is often ex-,
pressed with the use of the process of
injunction by the courts, not only in la
bor disputes, but where state laws are
concerned. I refrain from discussion of
this question as I am informed that it
will soon receive the consideration of the
supreme court."
Of other legislation in the Interest of
labor he favors federal inspection of rail
roads; providing limited but definite com
pensation for accidents to all workmen
employed in any way by the government,
and says:
"The constitutionality of the employers'
liability act passed by the preceding con
gress has been carried before the courts.
In two jurisdictions the law has been de
clared unconstitutional, and in three juris
dictions its constitutionality has been af
firmed. The question has been carried to
tns supreme court, the case has been
heard by that tribunal, and a decision is
I expected at an early date. In the event
I that the court should affirm the consti
tutionality of the act, I urge further leg
islation along the lines advocated In my
message to the preceding congress. The
practice of putting the entire burden ot
loss of life or limb upon the victim or
tne victim's family is a form of social in
justice in which the United States stands
in unenviable prominence. In both our
federal and our state legislation we have,
with few exceptions, scarcely gone
farther than the repeal of the fellow
servant principle of the old law of liabil
ity, and in some of our states even this
slight modification of a complete out
grown principle nas not yet been se
cured."
He favors the extension of the eight
hour law to all departments of the gov
ernment, and to all work carried on by
the government. He urges legislation
for the compulsory investigation of in
dustrial disputes, and says:
"The need for some provision for such
investigation was forcibly Illustrated
during the past summer. A strike of
telegraph operators seriously interfered.
with telegraphic communication, caus
ing great damage to business interests
and serious inconvenience to the gen
eral public Appeals were made to me
from many parts of the country, from
city councils, from boards of trade,
from chambers of commerce, and from
labor organizations, urging that steps
be taken to. r terminate the strike.
Everything that could with any pro
priety be done by. a representative of
the government was done without avail,
and for weeks the public stood by and
suffered without recourse of any kind.
Had the machinery existed and had
there been authority for compulsory
investigation of the dispute, the public
'would have been placed in possession
of the merit* of the controversy, and
public opinion would probably have
brought about prompt adjustment.
I •'It 1* idle to bold that without goo4
,
law* *vlls rush «* child labor, a* the
over-working of women, as the fail
ure to protect employes from loss of
life or limb, can be effectively reached,
any more than the evils of rebates and
stock-watering can he reached without
good laws. To fall to stop these prac
tices by legislation means to force
honest men Into them, because other
wise the dishonest who surely will
take advantage of them will have
everything their own way. If the states
will correct these evils, well and good;
but the nation must stand ready to aid
them.
Inland Waterway System*
Should Re Deevloped.
"The conservation of our national re
sources and their proper use constitute
the fundamental problem which under
lies almost every other problem of our
national life. We must maintain for
our civilization the adequate material
basis without which that civilization
cannot exist. We must show foresight,
we must look ahead. As a nation we
not only enjoy a wonderful meat are of
present prosperity but If this prosper
ity Is u«ed aright It is an earnest of
future success such as no other nation
will have. The reward of foresight foi
this nation is great and easily foretold.
But there must be the look ahead,
there must be a realization of the fact
that to w r ante, to destroy, our natural
resources, to skin and exhaust the land
instead of using it so as to increase its
usefulness, will result In undermining
in the days of our children the very
prosperity which we ought by right to
hand down to them amplified and devel
oped. For the last few years, through
several agencies, the government has
been endeavoring to get our people to
look ahead and to substitute a planned
and orderly development of
sources in place of a haphazard striv
ing for immediate profit. Our great
river systems should be developed as
national water highways;
sippi, with its tributaries, standing first
in importance, and the Columbia sec
ond. although there are many others of
importance on the Pacific and Atlantic
and the gulf slopes. The national gov
ernment should undertake this work,
and I hope a beginning will be made
in the present congress; and the great
est of all our rivers, the Mississippi,
should receive especial attention. From
the Great Lakes to.the moutli of the
Mississippi there should be a deep wa
terway, with deep waterways leading
from It to the east and the west. Such
a waterway would practically mean
the extension of our coast line into the
very heart of our country. It would be
of incalculable benefit to our people. If
begun at once it can be carried through
in time appreciably to relieve the con
gestion of our
lines of railroads,
systematically and continuously carried
forward in accordance w'ith some w'ell
The main streams
to the highest
point of efficiency before the improve
ment of the branches is attempted; and
the work should be kept free from
every tsint of recklessness or Jobbery."
Attention is called to the work of ir
rigation and reclamation of govern
ment lands. In the same connection he
asks for a revision of the public land
laws along the lines proposed by the
public lands commission. Believes the
government should increase its efforts
to conserve our forests and should in
crease by purchase the existing forest
preserves. On the subject of the natural
resources of the nation he says;
"In the eastern United States the
mineral fuels have already passed Into
the hands of large private owners, and
those of the west are rapidly following.
It is obvious that these fuels should be
conserved and not wasted, and it would
be well to protect the people against
unjust and extortionate prices, so far
as that can still be done.
b®en accomplished in
fields of the Indian Territory by the
action of the administration offers a
striking example of the good results
of such a policy. In my judgment the
government should have the right to
keep the fee of the coal, oil and gas
fields in its own possession and to lease
the rights to develop them under
proper regulations; or else, if the con
gress will not adopt this method, the
coal deposits should be sold under lim
itations, to conserve them as public
utilities, the right to mine coal being
separated from the title to the soil.
The regulations should permit coal
lands to be worked in sufficient quan
tity by the several corporations. The
present limitations have been absurd,
excessive, and serve no useful purpose,
and often render it necessary that
there should be either fraud or else
abandonment of the work of getting
out the coal."
Progress of the Work
On the Panama Canal.
"Work on the Panama canal Is pro
ceeding in a highly satisfactory man
ner. In March the total excavation in
the Culebra Cut, where efTort was
chiefly concentrated, was 815,270 cubic
yards. In April this was increased to
879,527 cubic yards. There was a con
siderable decrease In the output for
May and June owing partly to the ad
vent of the rainy season and partly to
temporary trouble with the steam
shovel men over the question of wages.
This trouble was settled satisfactorily
to all parties and in July the total ex
cavation advanced materially and in
August the grand total from all points
in the canal prism by steam shovels
and dredges exceeded all previous
United States records, reaching 1,274,
404 cubic yards. In September this rec
ord was eclipsed and a total of 1,517,
412 cubic yards was removed. Of this
amount 1,481,307 cubic yards were from
the canal prism and 36,105 cubic yards
were from accessory works. These re
sults were achieved in the rainy sea
son with a rainfall in August of 11.89
inches and in September of 11.65 inches.
Finally, in October, the record was
again eclipsed, the total excavation be
ing 1,868,729 cubic yards; a truly ex
traordinary record, especially in view
of the heavy rainfall, which was 17.1
inches. In fact, experience during the
last two rainy seasons demonstrates
that the rains ar* a less serious ob
stacle to progress than has hitherto
been supposed.
"Work on the locks and dams at
Gatun, which began actively In March
last, has advanced so far that it Is
thaught that masonry work on the
locks can be begun within 15 months.
"Last winter bids were requested and
received for doing the work of canal
construction by contract. None of them
was found to be satisfactory and all
were rejected. It Is the unanimous
opinion of the present commission that
the work can be done better, more
cheaply, and more quickly by the gov
ernment than by private contractors.
Fully 80 per cent, of the entire plant
needed for construction has been pur
chased or contracted for; machine
shops have been effected and equipped
for making all needed repairs to the
plant; many thousands of"'employes
have been secured; an effective organi
zation has been perfected; a recruiting
system is in operation which is capable
of furnishing more labor than can be
used advantageously; employes are
well sheltered and well fed; salaries
paid are satisfactory, and the work is
not only going forward smoothly, but
it is producing results far in advance
of the most, sanguine anticipations.

I*rr*idrnt Recommend*
Postal Savings Bantu.
"I commend to the favorable consid
eration of the congress a postal sav
ings bank system, as recommended by
the postmaster general. The primary
object is to encourage among our peo
ple economy and thrift and by the use
of postal savings banks to give them
an opportunity to husband their re
sources, particularly those who have
not the facilities at hand for depositing
their money in savings banks. Viewed,
however, from the experience of the
past few w'eeks. It is evident that the
advantages of such an institution are
still more far-reaching. Timid depos
itors have withdrawn their savings for
the time being from national banks; in
dividuals have hoarded their cash and
the workingmen their earnings; all
of which money haa been withdrawn
and kept in hiding or in the safe de
posit box to the detriment of pros
perity. Through the agency of the pos
tal savings banks such money would be
restored to the channels of trade, to
the mutual benefit of capital and labor.
"I further commend to the congress
the consideration of the postmaster
general's recommendation for an ex
tension of the parcel post, especially on
the rural routes. There are now 38,
215 rural routes, serving nearly 15,000,
000 people who do not have the ad
vantages of the inhabitants of cities in
obtaining their supplies. These recom
mendations have been drawn up to
benefit the farmer and the country
storekeeper; otherwise, I should not
favor them, for I believe that it is good
policy for our government to do every
thing possible to aid the small town
and the country district. It is desirable
that the country merchant should not
be crushed out.
"The fourth-class postmasters* con
vention has passed a very strong reso
lution In favor of placing the fourth
class postmasters under the civil-serv
ice law. The administration has al
ready put into effect the policy of re
fusing to remove any fourth-class post
masters save for reasons connected
with the good of the service; and it is
endeavoring sc far as possible to re
move them from the domain of partisan
politics. It would be a most desirable
thing to put the fourth-class postmas
ters in the classified service.'*
lie renews his recommendations of
last year in regard to Alaska; calls at
tention to the admission of Oklahoma
as a state; urges the importance of pro
viding shipping relief for Hawaii; asks
for citizenship for Porto Ricans, and
promises submission of Secretary
Taft's report on Philippines when that
official returns.
He asks for the creation of a bureau
of mines; recommends the providing of
funds for preserving The Hermitage,
the home of Andrew Jackson; and the
erection of a naval monument at
Vicksburg.
Corporation Contribution*
to Conipaign Expense*.
"Under our form of government voting
is not merely a right but a duty, and,
moreover, a fundamental and necessary
duty if a man is to be a good citizen.
It is well to provide that corporations
shall not contribute to presidential or
national campaigns, and furthermore to
provide for the publication of both con
tributions and expenditures. There is,
however, always danger in laws of this

Want* Improvement In the
Ocean Mail Service.
"I call your especial attention to the un
satisfactory condition of our foreign mail
service, which, because of the lack of
American steamship lines, is now largely
done through foreign lines, and which,
particularly so far as South and Central
America are concerned, is done in a man
ner which constitutes a serious barrier
to the extensions of our commerce.
"The time has come, in my judgment,
to set to work seriously to make our
ocean mall service correspond more
closely with our recent commercial and
political development. A beginning was
made by the ocean mail act of March 3,
1891, but even at that time the act was
known to be inadequate in various par
ticulars. Since that time events have
moved rapidly in our history. We have
acquired Hawaii, the Philippines, and
lesser islands in the Pacific. We are
steadily prosecuting the great work of
uniting at the Isthmus the waters of the
Atlantic and the Pacific. To a greater
extent than seemed probably even a
dozen years ago we may look to an
American future on the sea worthy of
the tradition of our past. As the first
step in that direction, and the step most
feasible at the present time, I recommend
the extension of the ocean mall act of
1891. That act has stood for some years
free from successful criticism of Its prin
ciple and purpose. It was based on theo
ries of the obligations of a great mari
time nation, undisputed in our own land
and followed by other nations since the
beginning of steam navigation. Briefly
those theories are, that It is the duty of
a first-class power so far as practicable
to carry its ocean mails under its own
flag; that the fast ocean steamships and
their crews, required for such mall serv
ice, are valuable auxiliaries to the sea
power of a nation. Furthermore, the
construction of such steamships Insures
the maintenance In an efficient condition
of the shipyards In which our battleships
must be built.
"The expenditure of public money for
the performance of such necessary func
tions of government is certainly war
ranted, nor Is It necessary to dwell upon
the Incidental benefits to our foreign
commerce, to the shipbuilding Industry,
and to ship owning and navigation which
will accompany the discharge of these
urgent public duties, though they, too,
should have weight."
Ask* Increase In Pay
for Army OfBeer* and Me*.
The president devotes much space to
the affairs of the army, and strongly
.urges that our regular military organi
sation be kept up to the highest possible
standard of efficiency, and says:
, "The medical corps should be much
greater than the needs of our regular
army In war. Yet at present it is small

burred less than ten years ago. The

"But the medical department Is not th#
only department for which increased pro
vision should be made. The rate of pay
for tiie officers should be greatly In
creased; there is no higher type of citizen
than the American regular officer, and ha
should have a fair reward for his ad

tively even greater Increase in the pay for
the enlisted men. An especial provision
should be made for establishing grade*
equivalent to those of warrant officers in
the navy, which should be open to th*
enlisted men who serve sufficiently long
and who do their work well. Inducement*
should be offered sufficient to encourag*
really good men to make the arnjy a lif*
occupation. The prime needs of our pres
ent army is to secure and retain compe
tent noncommissioned officers. This diffi
culty rests fundamentally on the ques
tion of pay. The noncommissioned officer
does not correspond with an unskilled la
borer; he corresponds to the best type of

official in civil institutions. Wages hava

and it is only during these last two or
three years that the training under
these conditions has become really ef

stride in advance is now being taken.

the Straits of Magellan to visit the
Pacific coast. Sixteen battleships ar®
going under the command of Rear Ad

cruisers and two other battleships will
meet him at San Francisco, whither
certain torpedo destroyers are also go

made such a voyage, and it will be of
very great educational use to all en

teach officers and men how to handle
the fleet so as to meet every possible
strain and emergency In time of war is
to have them practice under sfftillar
conditions in time of peace. Moreover,
the only way to find out our actual
needs is to perform in time of peace
whatever maneuvers might be neces

needs; that means to Invite disaster.
The trip to the Pacific will show what
some of our needs are and will enable
us to provide for them. The proper
place for an officer to learn his duty
is at sea, and the only way in which a
navy can ever be made efficient is by
practice at sea, under all the condi
