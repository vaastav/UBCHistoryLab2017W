Lamoille County Court.
The December Term of County
Court opened on Tuesday at Hyde
Park, with Hon. Homer E. Royce,
Chief Judge, presiding, assisted by
Hon. A. M. Kelley and Hon. S. A.
Andrews, Associates. Mr. Kelley en
ters upon his second term, while this
is Judge Andrews' first appearance.
"Sumner" makes a very good appear
ance on the bench and will doubtless
sustain the dignity of the court. Miss
Benham of Burlington acts as official
stenographer. Court was opened with
prayer by Rev. Mr. Ward, and the
court called by the Sheriff, Milo S
Burnell, who performed his maiden
duty with noticeable ease and dignity.
He has the bearing of an excellent
officer, and. will unquestionably, quiet
ly and efficiently, perform all the obli
gations resting upon him as guardian
of the public peace to the entire satis
faction of the people of the county.
The usual members of the bar of the
county were in attendance, including
"Gov." Binsham of Stowe, who not
withstanding the rout of the Demo
cratic party, is as kind-hearted and
genial as ever. From out of the coun
ty we noticed J. C. Burke, of Newport,
a first-rate fellow by the way, who will
shortly after next March devote his
entire time to bis profession, vv. u.
Stewart of Bakersfield,and Judge Shaw
and J. W. Russell of Burlington, were
also m attendance.
The Grand and Petit Jurors were
called by the Clerk, with the usual
"aye or "here as they were num
bered by the Sheriff. A. H. Keeler
of the Grand Jury, having served on
the Petit Jury within two years, was
excused, and J. A. Andrews of John
son substituted. E. W. Smith and J.
vv. bmitn, being postmasters, were
also excused ; Horace Wait of Eden,
and Chauncey Crocker of No. Hyde
Park were drafted. O. G. Harris on
account of illness in his family, was re
lieved and his place filled by Frank
Kenheld of Mornsville. Judge Mud
gett of Cambridge was made foreman
of the Grand Jury, which is a very in
telligent body of men, and from whom
good work may be expected.
The charge of the court to the
Grand Jury was very able, and re
ceived many compliments from the
bar and spectators for its clear and
concise expressions and delivery ; and
his charge to the Petit Jury was no
less able. The Judge justly censured
town authorities for putting names on
a jury list and thus allow to be drawn
as jurymen men whom they would be
unwilling to have sit on a case of their
own. The best men should be se
lected for jury duty.
Unly six cases appeared on the civil
jury calendar, and all were disposed
of by continuance, reference or settle
ment, excepting one, H. G. Fancher
vs. frank steams and Hiram Stearns.
This was an action for false warranty
of a horse, brought before Geo. Mon-
teith, a Justice of the Peace in John
son. The case came up on appeal by
Defts. and the law point presented to
the court previous to trial was the ju
risdiction of the justice on account of
his being an unnaturalized foreigner.
It seems, from remarks of counsel,
that Mr. Monteith was not elected but
received his appointment as justice
from the Governor. The court held
that the justice had no jurisdiction,
and the case passes to the Supreme
Court on exceptions by Plff. B. A.
Hunt and r. K. Gleed for Plff.; Wal
do Brigham for Defts. This closed
the civil jury calendar for the term.
I here are eleven cases on the old
criminal docket, an assignment of

afternoon was "Heme" Waterman.
A Democrat's View.
. The following is what Charles A.
Dana, a Democrat and editor of a
leading journal, says :
"On general principles," suid Mr. Dana, "in
order to insue the President a second term of
office, there must be something of special and
unusual importance to ooiiiuicnd liim to pub
lic favor, t'leveluud had 110 such element to
aid him. On the contrary he was handicapped
in manv ways. He had 110 strong personal
friends' lis was cordially disliked by the lead
ers of the Democratic party and the political
directors of the Democratic press. Even be
fore the el.-ction I did not believe there was a
more unpopular person in 1 he I'nited States
than ho, ami after next March, when the game
is all over, the universal wonder will r-e now
such a man as Cleveland evercame to fill such
a hiirh position. During his administration
he did nothing to win the confluence ana sup
port of his party ; in fact he did not care a
copper for the real interests of the Democrats
u-knt lio n-orked and schemed for from begin.
ninjr to end was the welfare and advancement
of Mr. G rover Cleveland. 111 his manner to
liia snniiorters he was always cold and over-
iKuirimr. and lie never, by any chance, pu
himself out to be courteous or accommodat
imr He thou irht himself to he a man of des
tiny, and so far above his followers that he
oiild kick them about ns he pleased. He has
finnllv discovered his mistake. He was ol
ways trying to produce a sensation that would
make people talk about him. He did not
choose anv given line of action so much be
cause he believed in it as because he believed
in its advantages for himself. He did not dare
to veto either the oleomargarine Dm or tne
river and harbor bill, although he was con
vinced that they were both unwise. He did
veto a lot of pension bills because he saw an
onnortnnitv to set people talking of his pru
dent oversight over expenses without alienat
ing anv of the influential classes. His knowl
edge on all subjects was superficial. In many
things lie made mistakes as to what would
rebound to his advantage. His negotiation
of the fisheries treaty and the extradition
treaty did him much harm among the Irish
and the fishermen. If he had not been politi
cally dead already, of course his position on
the tariff would have finished him.
The last election has, therefore, settled the
free trade question. No party can succeed in
the united istates which wavers in its adher
ence to protection. California wants protec
tion for its wines and woolens anairuits: Al
abama wants it for its iron, and so will Colo
rado in time. The whole west wants it for
manufactures and industries, which are
springing up there as if by magic. The East
has alwavs wanted it and the South will fol
low suit. The Democrats were beaten ii
fair fight because they deserved to be. There
never was an election more quiet and orderly
There was never one with less corruption at
the polls. To talk about Cleveland having
been kniled m .New lork by Hill and Hewett
is nonsense. those two men aided rather
than injured the Presidential candidate. The
bitterness aroused in New lork State by these
factional jealousies resulted in drawing out
an enormous vote, which always helped the
Democrats, iurthermore Hill gamed thou
sands of votes among Republicans opposed to
restricting the sale ol liquor, and many such
men were thus led to cast a straight Demo
cratic ticket. If the Democrats had chosen as
their candidate a man without Cleveland's
host of enemies, and if they had excluded
from their platform anything which might be
construed ns leaning toward free trade,
think there is no doubt they would have been
successful. As it is they are set back where
they were twenty years ago, and they have a
Republican majority against them in both
Houses.

Tie "E7orfc of Congress.
On Monday the closing session of
- the fiftieth congress began. It is the
"short session," closing on the fourth
of March, 1889. The President's
message, a lensrthv document, was
O - "
read Monday afternoon. It differs
largely from that of his last message
in that he speaks of various subjects
the surplus, foreign relations, fishery
question, Sackville episode and other
matters. Of course most of the Demo
crats think it a very able document,
-while others consider it well enough
for a valedictory. As usual, a large
portion of the business begun by this
congress will remain unfinished, and
much of it ought to. Nearly eleven
thrmqanrl six hundred bills were in
troduced in the house at the- first ses
sion. The larger portion of these
have died or will die in committee
About fifteen hundred bills remain on
the house calandar, and four hundred
on that of the senate, having been re
ported from the committees. Eleven
hundred and thitreen general bills,
joint resolutions and private acts were
passed by the two houses. The Presi
dent vetoed one hundred and twenty-
nine measures. Among the bills of
general importance which became
laws are those restricting Chinese im
migration; detailing officers of the
army and navy for educational pur
poses in the State colleges; broadening
the scope of the present law relating
to postal crimes, and making appro
priations for numerous lighthouses
and signals on the great lakes.
The divorce case, Hawley vs. Haw-
ley, Stowe parties, was dismissed the
contestants having made up.
The liquor case of State vs. Sulham
was continued by request of Atty. for
Respt., owing to absence of an im
portant witness.
In the case of State vs. Fisk, Ex
State's Atty. Parker, having a thorough
knowledge of the affair, was appointed
to prosecute the same.
The Burlington Independent of last
week says : " To-morrow Assistant
Clerk Powers of the House will as
sume the duties of State's Attorney
01 L,amoule County, and a good one
he will make, too.
For the first time in nearly a score
of years, Lanpher was absent during
the hrst day ot court. He is overseer
of poor for his town and he was com
pelled to be absent on business per
taming to that office.
During the first day the case of
Sarah M. Camp vs. H. W. Camp, El
more parties, a dispute over boundary
line, was announced as settled. The
Plff. gets one cent damages and $25
costs, tne line being as Pitt, claims.
The officers assigned to the charge
ot the Grand Jury are Deputy Sher
iffs Doane and Stevens, while depu
ties Kaymore, .Lanpher and Parker
have charge of the Petit Jurors. The
other deputies attend to the outside
business.
According to the Sun, the present
administration is going to scatter af
ter the 4th of March. Mr. Cleveland
will take a long vacation of sight see
ing and DbhiDg without going abroad,
and will then probablv settlp fin van in
New York. Bayard will eo to his
country estate in Delaware and aban
don politics. Whitney is going to
Europe with his family : Fairchiln,will
return to his home in Cn
his Albany lw office : Endicott will
go back to Massachusetts and the law :
Garland will go into law practice at
Washington ; Dickinson is so dazed
by the result of the election in Michi
gan that he does not know what to do
next ; Vilas will go back to Wisconsin
and try law practice. The election
has rudely disturbed the dreams of
future greatness of all these gentlemen.
In no other country would it be pos
sible for public men so ptominent to
drop into the utter Insignificance and
obscurity to which they are all doomed.
Two-thirds of the work on the Ben
nington monument will be finished by
the close of the present season, and
the contractor only began June 4,
1X87, and has till thesame date 1890,
to complete his work. It stood 120
feet high at the last measurement and
is already a striking sight against the
horizon.
The repair shops of the Rutland
and Bennington road are taxed to
their greatest capacity at present.
The management are having 15 pas
senger and baggage coaches fitted out
with the Sewell heating apparatus,
following the example of the Central
Vermont and Delaware and Hudson
railroads. The new service will be
put in use January 1. Several new
flat cars and charcoal cars are being
built.
Some Suggestive Don'ts.
Don't snub a boy because he wears
shabby clothes. When Edison, the
inventor ot tae teiepnone, nrst en
tered Boston, he wore a pair of yel
low linen breeches in the depth of
winter. Don't snub a boy because
his home is plain and unpretending.
Abraham Lincoln's early home was a
log cabin. Don't snuh a boy because
of the ignorance of his parents
ooaKespeare, me wonu s poet, was
the son of a man who was unable to
write bis name. Don't snub a boy
because he chooses a humble trade
Tbe author of "The Pilgrim's Pro
gress was a unKer. Don t snub a
boy because of pbvMcnl disability.
Milton was blind. Don't snub a boy
because of dullness at his lessons
Hogarth, the celebrated painter and
engraver, was a stupid boy at his
books. Don't 6nub a boy because he
stutters. Demosthenes, the greatest
orator of Greece, overcame a harsh
and stammering voice. Don't snub
any one. JNot alone because, some
day he may far outstrip you in the
race of life, but because it is neither
kind nor right nor Chriatianlihe.
From Missouri.
St. Louis. Mo., Nov. 29, 18SS.
Editors News and Citizen :
It Is not generally known that there
are some large things in St. Louis. Yet
it is a fact that this city can boust of
some tolerably gigantic structures. For
instance there is here the largest sewer
on the continent; the water tower on
Graud Avenue is the tallest tonic tower
in the world ; the Chamber of Commerce
is the largest hall without interior sup
ports in the world ; Shaw's botanical gar
dens are unequaled for variety and beau
ty of flowers in the world; Lafayette
l'ark is pronounced the most beautiful
piece of landscape gardening in the
world; Forest 1'arK is oniy exceeueu oy
one other in America in acreage; Sc
Louis Bridge stands unrivalled as an en
gineering triumph, and one may add it is
also unrivalled as being owned by tb
greatest monopoly in the world. Ni
similar institution can compare with th
St. Louis Fair Grounds, not to inentio
such trifles as that 40 per cent, of all the
castor oil made 111 the country is maim
factured here; also that St. Louis has th
largest hardware house and the largest
wholesale drug house 111 America.
It is many years since the State
Missouri has produced such crops as have
been harvested the past tail, and espec
lally is this true of lruit. Peaches, ap
pies, pears and grapes are abundant and
of good quality. The State is extremely
uneven as regards its products; one year
a famine and the next plenty, only th
famine has lasted lor several years 1
succession until the present. In this it
much resembles the climate which flies
from hot to cold with bewildering rapid
ity. The 5th annual exposition has been
opened and the display is remarkable
when it is considered that it is entirely
local. The building covers nearly two
blocks and is crowded with raw material
and manufactured goods. It is open 40
days and about 10,000 people visit th
building dally. There are two notice
able peculiarities about the St. LouL
people. One is the small stature of th
men and the other is the freedom and
rudeness of the young girls. As to the
size of the male St. Louisian, he will av
erage about 130 pounds in weight and 1
about 5 feet, 7 or 8 Inches in height
When you see a tall stout man on the
street you may rely on it he is not a na
tive of St. Louis. The girls and women
walk about the streets 111 bands, with un
covered heads, talking and laughing loud
ly, and this in the west end, the aristo
cratic part of the city. Every one here
during the warm weather sits upon th
front steps of the houses. 1011 may
walk through miles and miles of resi
dence streets on a warm summer evei
ing and find the steps of every lion
crowded with people. The health of the
city is fairly good as compared with oth
er cities of its size. Like all the Mississip
pi river towns south of Davenport. Iowa
it is malarious. I have seen lots of case
of old fashioned chills and fover this
summer. The consumption of quinine is
simply enormous. Lverybody, almost
is a quinine heiiu. I nure is enough.
the drug consumed every week to kil
half the people in the State of Vermont
were Vermonters, who are comparative
ly unused to the drug, forced to take it,
Perhaps this has something to do with
the small size and sallow complexion of
the men.
The principal theatres of St. Louis are
open on buudays as well as week days
and the same is true of the saloons. An
effort wa3 made last spring to close th
saloons ou Sunday, but it failed. Som
keep the front door closed, but there is
always a side door. There have been
many arrests of saloon keepers for vio
lating the Sunday law, but not a solitary
conviction, lhe courts of tt. Louis are
not models of justice. A man with plen
ty of money has little fear of the law. It
is said that no man worth 620,000 or up
wards has ever yet been convicted 111
St. Louis court. Just now the people
are complaining, and with justice, of the
discrimination ot the railroads again 5
St. Louis. Excursion tickets are sold
from St. Louis to the surrounding cities
Chicago, Cincinnati, Kansas City, etc,
at very cheap rates, but any one coming
to this city is charged full fare. St. Louis
will never develop as it should till the
grip of Jay Gould upon it is broken. He
owns most of the roads centering here
the bridge, the Union depot, etc. The
depot is a disgrace to any city. A town
of 10,000 inhabitants would be ashamed
of it. A tariff of nearly 73 cents is
charged for every passenger who crosses
tbe bridge on the railroads.
1 he Sc. Louisiana are rein.irl.:ih v m.
tient, quiet people. There are few liirtits
upon tlie streets: murders are rare, a
arrests for crimes of yiolence less 111 pro
portion to the population than any other
city iu the United States. The St. Louis
man when drunk makes very little noise.
Suicides are frequent. Four were re
ported last Sunday. Hardly a day passes
but what one or two persons take their
own life in this city. Great robberies
arc rare. There are very few St. Louis
pien in Canada. Fires are frequent but
not largely destructive, society lines
are sharply drawn, and not altogether on
a money basis. The churches are all
good structures, but none of them spleu
uiu. lue congregations are small and
preachers dull beyond endurance. There
is not a great orator in St. Louis.

gist. A Timely Thought.
Has it ever occurred to you that
everybody is insured that is, every
body who owns any piece of property,
er whose life has any money value?
Probably this has not occurred to you,
yet it is simply and in the ordinary
meaning of language true that every
body who is not supported at the ex
pense of somebody else is insured. If
he has not taken out a policy iu the
usual manner, you ask, how?
No question is easier to answer.
Whenever a piece of property is de
stroyed the accruing loss falls on
the owner, necessarily. If he holds
a contract of indemnity from some as
sociation of property owners called
an insurance company, he is repaid
most of the loss ; if lie does not hold
such a coutract, he must pay the
whole himself, and get on with it as
well as he can. For easy handling
let us take easy figures. Say that the
property is worth a thousand dollars,
and that an insurance policy on it
would cost a hunVlred dollars a year.
If vou " nnv tl.e-lhnnr,,,cci 1 rtolldrs nrT
take a formal policy, you are insured
in the every-day8ense of that word.
If you go without the policy, you pay
the hundred dollars to yourself by
keeping it in your pocket ; this is ex
cellent, and it is what seems to many
persons economy but you also take
the risk of losing the thousand. That
is, you receive your own premium and
issue your own policy to yourself
and if you should take the trouble to
write out a formal policy yourself and
sign and seal it, the fact would not
be altered.
Then is it not perfectly true that
everybody is insured somehow, the
method being the sole place of varia
tion? And is it not p'ain that thi is
equally true as to human lives?
There is onh' one difference : if you
insure your property yourself and
lose it, you have received the premi
um and pay the "policy" ; if you treat
your life in the same way, you get the
premium, but your ianu'.y must lose
the property. You are getting the
benefit of the "saved" premium, or at
least, getting vour share of it with
your family, and compelling them to
do the insuring.
Now is this fair? Is it business
like? Is it cornmonsense and reason?
As you would certainly take it to be a
reflection upon your intelligence if
some one should come to you with
money in band and without any med
ical certificate, asking you to write
him out an insurance contract on his
life for it would at once seem clear
to vou, even if you never heard of
average and could not give a very
nlelligible explanation of the reason,
that you couldn't afford to do any
Buch thing, and a man who thought
ou would must take you for a fool
how is it that you are insuring your
own hre and thus doing what you
would instantly refuse to do as to any
other life?
You never thought about it? Yes,
thut ia the reas&ii, Cf-course. But if
railroad bridge has been getting
weak it will let a train through at the
proper time, even if nobody has
thought about it. Things happen
ust the name whether thought about
or not. If foretiioiifiht hag not been
used, the t-alpmity is not in the least
averted or mo ifled. The course of
human events neyif accepts "forgot
it" hh au excuse, although individuals
sometimes do. Suppose you do think
