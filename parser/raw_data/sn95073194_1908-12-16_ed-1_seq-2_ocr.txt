states are urging that the adjourn
ment should begin on Saturday and
the leaders are disposed to heed.
When taken the holiday adjournment
will be until January 4.
It Is expected that both houses will
deal during the week with the ques
tion of the paragraph in the presi
dent's message relating to the secret
service. The Perkins committee prob
ably will present its report to the

dealing with the subject is recom
mended it will be acted upon before

is to have introduced a resolution
sinilar to that passed by the house
which authorized a committee to deal
with the question and report back.
Who shall introduce the resolution
and what committee shall be desig
nated to perform the service are not
yet absolutely determined'.

Senator Carter to procure the passage
of his bill providing for the establish
ment of postal savings banks, and on

THE STATE CAPITAL

CITIZENS.
TO ALL
Auditor Searle Estimates that It Will
Be Paid in Full by July 1st
1909.
Receipts of the Biennium.
The estimated reccits for the hi.
ennium made by State Auditor Searle.
including receipts of the temporary
school fund, amount to $0,654,392.18,
and the expenditures estimated tor
the biennium amount to $G,499,9S7 03,
leaving a surplus .of $154,405.23. Tho
receipts are estimated on a collection
of 95 per cent of the general funi
levy and on other funds actual col oc
tions. According to Mr. Searle the
floating debt of the state will be
wiped out by July 1, 1909.
At the close of the last biennium,
November 30, 1906, the floating interest-bearing
debt of the state amount
ed to $1,916,671.31. At the close of
the biennium ending November 30,
1908, the same amounted to $768,478.
72, showing a decrease of $1,148,192.59
for the period. The special levy pro
vided by the Sheldon bill has retired.
$636,123.95 of the debt, and the bal
ance of the decrease, or $512,068.64,
arose from increased valuations and
new property listed. This has been
brought about by the operation of the
new revenue law. A large majority
of te county treasurers report that
under the present system over 99 per
cent of the tax Itv'.ed is collected.
The total income of the general
fund for the fiscal period commencing
April 1, 1909, and ending March 31,
1911, is $4,389,928.64. This estimate
Is based on 95 per cent of the prob
able levies of 1910 and 1909 assum
ing that the assessments and levies
for these years will not differ materi
ally from the total assessments and'
levies for the year 1908. This estimate,
being based so nearly on a 100 per
cent basis, necessitates no estimate
on that basis. The reports heretofore
have been based on 85 per cent in
stead of 95 per cent, but we have done
away with that basis owing to the pro
visions made under he new revenue
law for the collection of the total
amount levied, although 85 per cent
was a good average under the old law.

Yards Switch Rates Higher.
The application of the South Omaha
Stock Yards company to increase its
switching charge has in practically
every instance been granted by the
State Railway commission. The rail
roads were ordered to file their
schedules absorbing the shipping
charges. The order makes the follow
ing rates:
First Live stock received from or
delivered to a connecting line, 75
cents per car.
Second All commodities delivered
to connecting lines, 32 per car, except
ing cinders, rubbish and cars loaded
for Omaha proper, on which switching
will be charged $1 per car.
Third All commodities received
from connecting lines for industries
located on tracks of Union Stock
Yards company, $2 per car.
Fourth All commodities switched
from the transfer track of one rail
road direct to transfer track of anoth
er, $2 per car. such cars when empty
to be returned free.
Fifth All empty cars switched
from the transfer track of one rail
road direct to the transfer track of an
other, $1 per car.
Sixth When firms require switch
ing of cars from one part of their
yard to another or from the tracks of
one firm to those of another, the
charge will be $2 per loaded and $1
per empty car.
Elevate Price of Bonds.
State house officials who were for
tunate enough to secure another term
of office are objecting strenuously to
the increase in cost of bonds that
they will have to put up. Since two
years ago the price asked by bonding
companies for surety for state officials
has been Increased more than 100 per
cent. Three bids were received from
bonding companies by one state
official, which bids did not vary in
price. One of the agents frankly
stated that the companies had got to
gether and would stop cutting rices, i

wish will be the law in this Instance.
The dancing will be in the senate

Sores Developed Only Cui-
cura Proved Successful.
"About four years ago I had a very
severe attack of inflammatory rheuma
tism. My skin peeled, and the high
fever played havoc with my hair,
which came out in bunches. I also
had three large bed sores on my back.
I did riot gain very rapidly, and my
appetite was very poor. I tried many
sure cures' but they were of little
help, and until I tried Cuticura Re
solvent I had bad no real relief. Then
my complexion cleared and soon I felt
better. The bed sores went very soon
after a few applications of Cuticura
Ointment, and when I used Cuti
:ura Soap and Ointment for my hair
It began to regain its former glossy ap
pearance. Mrs. Lavina J. Henderson,
138 Broad St., Stamford, Conn., March
6 and 12, 1907."

mine!"

Lave Generates Sunshine.
Love generates the sunshine of tka
moral universe, without which Ufa
would be a desert waste. It brigateaa
the dark places. It gladdens the sor
rowing. It lifts us above the petty
grinding; cares that burden the heart
and sap enthusiasm and energy-
There never was a more thorough
truth than that hate, envy, revenge,
and all the evil passions that we are
heir to. corrode, render wretched and
destroy first the heart in which they
originate.
Love will draw the world to you
and surround you with an atmosphere
of happiness and success. Every hard
thought gives birth to a singing ser
pent in your own heart.
The cashing in of the emotions in
any form plays smash with the sin-
hcerity of any subsequent emotion on
the part of the vender.
Yes, a magic vase is that which
overflows with what is dropped into
it And that magic vase is no fanci
ful conception.
Drinking Barley Water.
Now that grown-ups as well as ba
bies drink chilled barley water during
the warm weather, every one is learn
ing how to make it.
It is supposed to be better than lem
onade and has excellent tonic proper
ties; It is recommended by all doc
tors for those whose stomachs are not
very strong through the rammer
Beason.
A good way to make it is a fol
lows: Put a scant cupful of barley in
an earthen vessel and cover with two
or three quarts of boiling water.
When cold, strain and add lemon juice.
It should be kept on ice in order that '.t
may be chilled. This is better than
serving It with cracked ice in a glass.
It's funny where some folks get
their rep for disdom. For instance.
Solomon is said to have had a thou
sand wives.
By lifting the burdens of others we
lighten our own. By making others
happy we bring happiness to our
selves. Laundry work at home would be
much more satisfactory if the right
Starch were used. In order to get the
desired stiffness, it is usually neces
sary to use so' much starch that the
beauty and fineness of the fabric Is
hidden behind a paste of varying
thickness, which not only destroys the
appearance, but also affects the wear
ing quality of the goods. "This trou
ble can be entirely overcome by using
Defiance Starch, as it can be applied
much more thinly because of its great
er strength than other makes.
Some women get red in the face
because of innate modesty; some get
furiously red. because of their quick
tempers; some women get beautifully
red In the face because of the beauty
doctor.
With a smooth iron and Defiance
Starch, you can launder your shirt
waist Just as well at home as the
steam laundry can; it will have the
proper stiffness and finish, there will
be less wear and tear of the goods,
and it will be a positive pleasure to
use a Starch that does not stick to
the Iron.
If you drop In love. It overflows
love. If you drop In charity, it over
flows charity. Drop In envy and
Jealousy and hate, and It will over
flow these things into your own life.
To praise a good action Is to par
ticipate In its repetition.
