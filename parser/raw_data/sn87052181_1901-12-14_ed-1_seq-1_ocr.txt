London, Dee. 7.--The comment if j
I the weeklies on President Roosevelt's j
message to congress is not generally '
' so friendly as that of the dailies. The '
j Speaker devotes the entire space to
acrid comment on the trust refer-j
I enees. The paper declares the pres- i
j ident's treatment of a grave, econom-
i ie situation is trivial in form and j
' unsatisfactory in substance, adding: j
1 "Did we not entertain a genuine j
i belief in the goodne-ss of the presi
, dent's intentions, we should regard

The article concludes as follows:
j "For such a stude-nt of industrial
I politics, as Mr. Roosevelt professes to ,
i be, to ignore these conditions, is an I
! act of intellectual daring that does '
him little credit. The- upshot of tin:
message is to minimize and inisrcj-re-sent
the dangers of trusts and to
postpone any serious attempt to
grapple with them."
Thi! Saturday Review, on the other
hand, remarks:
"All industrial undertakings in the j
United States are; more scientifically!
organized than in any other country, I
as we have learned to our cost. The j
trust is the last weird of this svs-1
tern of scientific organization, and the
president is right when he declines
to hamper the captains of industry.

Fourth Colored Infnntry Cy
tiured at Decapitated.
Manila, Dec. 9. Native s,eoiitM from
lleiigubon, Province of Nueva EVlj.1,
have killed the American negro, David
Fagin, a deserter from the Twenty
fourth colored infantry, who fur more
than two years lins been leading- Fili
pinos against the American troops.
The native scouts decapitate! their

Lieut. Frederick W. Alstactter. of

Filipinos, supposedly under the com
mand of Fagin himself, October 2S,
1900. Fagin has been reported killed

A military commission has sen
tenced the Filipino general, Isidore
Torri-s, to be hanged, after finding
him guilty of ordering the assassina
tion of Corporal Ficldntr of the
Twelfth infantry at Malolos, Province
of llaliiae-an. hist October. The sen
tence of the commission has been dis
appre.vcel by Gen. Chaffee, who finds
that the commission had reasonable
grounds to doubt whether Gen.
Torres personally ordered the assas
sination of the American soldier.
i (;t.n. Chaffee thinks that the high
( rank held by Torres in the insurgent
armv would have been sufficient to
prevent such unmilitary action on his
part.

The- I'nited States Filipino commis

supplies purchased, as the merchants
refuse to sell goods for Mexican

A general feeling of uneasiness pre

I nited States Philippine commission
intends to reduce: by the difference of
the fall in the price of silver, the
present ratio of two Mexican dollars
for one gold dollar. It is hoped, how
ever, that some solution of the diQi

Two Persons Burned to Death and

an Early Morning Fire.
iiOTHER AND ONE DAUGHTER PERISHED.
The Father Saeceeded In Satins; ths
Other Sis of His Children. But All
of Them AVer Injured. Soms
Quite Seriously Charred Ile-n"ln
of the Dead Found.
Pittsburg. Pa., Dec. 7. Two per
sons were burned to death and seven
injured in a fire at Carnegie, Pa., Fri
day morning. The dead are: Mrs
Sarah Klce, aged 43, and her daugh
ter, Mary, aged nine. The injured:
Samuel Klce, aged 30; Ida Klee, aged
20; Anna Klee, aged 17; Uaciel Klee.
aged 14; Eva Klee, aged 10; Jennie
Klee, aged G, nnd Harry Klee, age?d 4.
The Burned Home.
The Klee residence is a twostory
frame house on Broadway, the
ground floor front being devoted to a
grocery store kept liy Klee, and tlie
rest of the house being occupied by
the family.
The fire was discovered about 4:4P
a. m. by the grocery clerk, Morris
Fizis. He immediately gave the alarm
but the flames spread so rapidly that
the occupants of the upper story
were shut off from the stairway, and
Klee and his wife realized that them
was but one way to save the chil
dren and that was to throw them
from the window, a distance of about
twenty feet.
Rescuing the Children.
One by one the children were
brought to the front window, anil
dropped to the ground by the father.
All of them were more or less seri
ously injured, but all escaped death
from the flames, except Mary. I5
the time Harry, the baby, was
reached, not only was the father ex
hausted with his exertions and the
terrible conditions under which lie
.worked, but the flames were fast
making his efforts impossible. When
he was able to get at Harry, it was
found that the fire had already
reached him and that the little one's
face and feet and hands were blis
tered and burned. Ha was snatched
from the flames just in time, and it
is thought that he will survive.
Mother and DaURhter Missed.
After rescuing his baby, the father
looked around for his wife, whom he
had missed from his side or some
time. Unable to locate her, he called
to those who he had saved for the
purpose of ascertaining if she had
joined them. She had not, and th
husband became almost distracted
with fear and panic. It seems, how
ever, that while the father was res
cuing the youngest and most helples-s
child, she was maliing an attempt to
save the life of Mary, and in doing so
gave up her own life.
Charred Remains Found.
The charred remains of the mother
and daughter were found in the ruinss
side by side. Both had been over
come by the smoke before they could
escape from the room. When the fire
men arrived the father refused lo
leave the building without his wife
and child, and the firemen were com
pelled to forcibly carry him from the
burning building.
JANE TOPPAN INDICTED.
The Grand Jury at Barnstable, Mass..
Charee None Toppan W ith Threo
Startlers by I'olson.
Barnstable, Mass., Dec 7. Miss
Jane Toppan, of Lowell, stood up in
the superior court late yesterday
afternoon and hearel the grand jury's
indictment charging her with the
murder of -three persons whom she
had been engaged to nurse back to
health, but who had died under her
charge', and, according to the indict
ment, by her hand. The indictments,
nnd there are three eine charging
her with the death of Mrs. Henry V.
Gibbs, a second with the death of
A. P. Davis, both of Cataumet, anil
the thirel with that of Mrs. Genevieve
Gordon, of Chicago all alleged that
the cause was the administration of
poisonous drugs, ten grain of mor
phine or atrophine, or morphine and
ntrophine together, or by some poi
son unknown to the jury.
For ten minutes the woman stood
tightly clutching the rail while the
clerk re'ad the indictment charging
her with the murder of Mrs. Gibbs.
At length Miss Toppan's counsel
spared her further agony by waiving
the reading, and all that remained
was for her to plead. Three times
she was asked if she was guilty of
the murder, and three times she re
plied in a low voice, "Xot guilty."
After the woman had entered her
plea her counsel asked that the state
appoint counsel for her, nnd Chief
Justice Mason, who presided, said
that he would take the matter under
advisement. Miss Toppan was then
led away to her cell, where she will
remain until some time early next
spring, when she will be given a trial
by jury.
