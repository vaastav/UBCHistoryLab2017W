"', IHTBTtlSTIKO to Wate-taki.s. the
Superintendent of the City Water Works, in
forms us that the water-takers will ssve
themselves considerable inconvenience knd
expense, by closing their stop and water
cocks every night during the winter. t
Whoever went once to his draw-cock in tthe
morning, intending to got a quantity of ibis
salubrious article for a refreshing bath and
found his water. , pipe froien solid, will ap
preciate this timely warning. j
Btdeb'i. A half hour at Byder'a in
1 looking through his Sue collection of por
traits and sitting for a Christmas photograph
for a wife or sweetheart would be time profit
ably rpent. Among his late pictures! we
noticed a very gem of a little portrait of ft
youthful lady with a lovely face. It Was
finished in oil by Air. Raphael Straussj of
Cincinnati. For delicacy of coloring and ex
quisite finish, it is really tho Sncst picture
we hare seen. Ryder has a peculiar tray of
getting up those litUe heads that is pleas
ing to his customers. Try him. j
Willouobbt Plane Road Co. vs. The
East Clkvilaitd 6Trr R. R. Co. Iirnmc
Tio OaAKTin. The decision in the above
ase was readered by Judge Foote yesterday
afternoon. He granted a perpetual injunc
tion in favor of the Willoughby Plank Rad
Co., granting to the Street Railroad Co. the
privilege of appropriating the property on
which they desire to lay the road, the same
fta railroad companies appropriate the pro-
yerty of individuals, damages being assessed
in a proper manner. The work of building
the .railroad, which has been suspended
while the case has been pending, will pro
bably be resumed at once.
The Tebth Cavalxt destined to
Socth Cabolika. General Hunter, in com
mand ef the troops in South Carolina, desires
a eonple ef regiments of Ohio cavalry to be
ftdded to his command. Qorernor Tod has
specified the 10th Cavalry, Colonel Smith,
now at Camp Cleveland, and one other whose
number we bave not learned, for that service.
Major Thayer is now in Columbus for the
purpose of obtaining equipments for the reg
iment. They will proceed from here
to Washington, where it is expected they
will receive horses. The time of their de
parture iaot yet stated. The regiment will
. be tiled up from the 8th Cavalry, now at Camp
i Chaa.
The 10th Cavalry will probably participate
in operations against Charleston, which will
k not probably be long delayed. They may
quarter their chargers in that treasonable
eity ere long.
Academy or Music. A stormy and in
clement night did not prevent a full house
last night to witness the first production of Do
Walden's celebrated drama " Peep o' Day."
The play was strongly cast, and well put
- upon the Itage as regards scenery, costume
Ac Taken as a whole it is one of the most
interesting of plays, and cannot fail to have
a successful run. Mr. Conway as " Barney
O'Toole " gives a graphic delineation of the
rollicking, warm-hearted and impetuous
Irishman, while the part of " Kathleen Ear
anagh " is well calculated to display the ar
tiltic powers of Mrs. Conway. The author of
this play, Mr. DeWalden, played the part of
, " Black Mullin " with ft naturalness and force
which prove him to be alike excellent as
actor and author. McCollom, Carrol, Stuart
rad Lewis, performed each his part well.
The lights and ahadea of life in Ireland are
ftronsly portrayed throughout the play. The
scene of the Fair, with its dancing and Sght-
inr drew thundering applause. The care
seen is a thrilling on and excites "the in.
- tensest interest. ,
The play will be rFte4 to-Bifht. . ' v
a
Nxsdt at thi Tsxatt. " Neddy," the
school boy who furnished us the artiole on
Winter, "has been to the theater recently, and
sends as his impressions:
Ma. Editoi : I hardly expected that yon
would print my composition on Winter when
I sent it to you, but as yon did, perhaps you
would like something more. I will tell you
about my visit to the theater. I had often
read the great bills which Mr. Eilslar pastes
up after everybody goes to bed (poor man, he
don't get much sleep, Iancy,) and wanted
to go very much but father wouldn't let me.
He gave his consent the other night aad I
went, along with brother Bob. Bob has been
lots and knows' all abont it. He is acquaint
ed there, Bob is. I saw him talking with
the man that plays the big fiddle. But I am
ahead of my story. .We fell in with the crowd
and went, taking seats near the stags. The
music was playing and the curtain was dowa.
The picture on that curtain would be a nice
thing if those horrid looking men would get
into those coal scows and paddle out of sight.
A very little alteration wonld change them
into snubbing posts, and then they wouldn't
look so bad. The bell rang at length and
up rolled the curtain, the men on it grinning
horribly as they disappeared, heels first. I
saw them in my sleep that night.
If there wasn't any paint, there couldn't
be any theater. They have painted water,
painted trees, painted bridges, painted par
lors and drawing-rooms and kitchens, and
every player is painted. Paint makes you
think yon are looking at a great forest or a
high mountain, when you are only looking at
a big pieoeof eloth strotched on a frame and
streaked with various colors.
I don't remember the name of the play.
and didn't understand it very much, I must
confess. I liked it for all that. There was
a good looking villain who talked a great
deal to himself, generally speaking louder
then than he did when talking to others. He
laid a plot to mate a good-looking woman a
widow, so that he eould marry her. After
declaring his intention at the top of his
voice, (she was by, but pretended not to
hear,) be said " I nfust away I" and dashed
through a eanvas door in great haste. I sat
where fcould look iifbehind the scenes on
one aide, and a minute after the good-looking
villain started off so ' fiercely to mur
der somebody, I got a glimpse . of
him back there amoking a cigar as harm
less as a kitten 1 The good looking woman's
husband goes out to gnide a Brigadier Gene
ral of volunteers over Little Mountain, when
some boys in red flannel coats come out and
fire off some guns, pointing in a different di- j
rection from the men they are shooting at.
The villain comes in, tells good looking wo
man her husband is dead. She faints, and
villain carries her off, while the band cramps
mournful air on their fiddles. This is the
first part. In the second part the guide who
went off with the brigadier, and then came in
dead, turns up alive and is running a livery
stable. Tillain has married the widow (she
proved to be rich) and lives in a three story
brick house not far eff. I can't write all
that goes on in the play, but the guide finds
his wife and daughter, (I forgot to say there
was ft daughter that in the first part was
nothing but a rag doll, but which grew in the
second part to be a very beautiful lady) the
villain is foiled (I believe that is the word)
and everything ends happily, showing that
virtue is its own reward, and a good hand
writing is a letter of reoommendation. 1

ed. Mr. Colamer nresented the credential
of Hon. Salmon Foole, re-elee(ed Senator
from Vermont. ' ' .
Mr. Davis offered a resolution that af
ter it had become manifest that an insur
rection against the United State was
about to break out in several . States,
James Buchanan, then President, from
sympathy with the conspirators and their
treasonable projects, failed to take the

and condemnation of the Senate, and of
the American people. Laid over. '

lion States, or the agent or trustees 1 of

Mr. Fessenden offered the following :
Resolved, That the proclamation of the
President, of the date September 22d,lSC2,
is warranted by the Constitution ; that t,he
policy of emancipation, as indioated Hick-tin,
is well adapted to hasten the restora
tion of peace, is well chosen as a war meas
ure, and is an exercise of power with pro
per regard to the rights of citizen and the
perpetuity of a free Government.

Resolution in relation to certain citizens
of Delaware was taken up. Mr. Davis
proceeded to speak at length in favor of
the resolution, arguing that the President
had no authority, under the Constitution,
to make any such arrests. Tbe President
had no right to suspend a law or define its
execution. After some argument, Davis
admitted that the President was ex
cusable in arresting Gov. Moorehead, of
Ky. It was even commendable. It would
not have been inexcusable to have arrest
ed the leaders of the Hartford Convention,
or Buchanan to have arrested Phillips,
Cheever, and those miserable nisereants.
He denied that slavery was. the cause of
the war. It was becausethe New England
and other States had abolished slavery and
commenced a crusade again9t the States
which held on to it. He thought the ".peo
ple would arise and reconstruct this'
Union, and leave Massachusetts out In the
cold and froien regions. If the war had
been carried on according to the principles
of the Crittenden Compromise, it would
have been finished long ago.
The Senate then went into Executive

he knew to be true, namely: "Tiat the
removal of McClellan was a sacrifice to

in favor of conducting the war by organ
ized armies, and under and not above the
the Constitution. The administration will
