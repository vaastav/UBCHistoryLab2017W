TTASHIN'GTOK, Dec 11. — Since the
<la.j-s of President Johnson there has
been no situation in TTasMnston ap
proachinsr that existing sines thl» aft
ernoon, when Speaker Cannon cour
teously-waited on the president and In
formed him that unless ha withdrew
Insulting words in his message, a house
resolution would b« passed appointing
censors for the message with a view
to having the ho us« defend tha breach
In Its privileges.
The president, defiant. Is said to have
retorted that hs did not car© what the
house did, except that he -would like It
to investigate tha Panama canal and
tell Tt?» truth.
Tha Louse then paEsed a. resolution
introduced by Perkins of Kew York,
appointing' a committee of five to ds
cJde -«rhH± should be done in view , of
the president's reflections on the.con
gTess. It "was passed by a unanimous
vote amid impressive silence. The sen
ate next Tr^ek irlll taka action almost
similar. Tha situation is verj tenscC
. The committee on appropriations to
day oncovered the fact that tha presi
dent, without the authority of congress,
ordered Colonel Bromwell, superinten
dent of public buildings and grounds,
to raxe the old Pennsylvania station,
which is the property of the United
States. This Is declared to be an illegal
act. and an Jndictable offense.
??o one Trould be surprised at any
ponsatlonal developments gTowing out
of the 6trif c between the president and
congress. The president is tired of his
office, is disgusted -with congress and
reckless of consequences, and members
of congreES have been told that the pres<
ident may go po far as to make pub
. lie facts ascertained about members of
congress by the secret service which
have never been suspected.
House Takes Action
WASHINGTON, Dec il.—Represent
ative Perkins of York today intro
duced a resolution which heretofore
had been agreed upon, providing for
the appointment of a special committee
of five members to. consider the proper
means of dealing with that portion of
the president's message which criti
cises the course of congress in pro
hibiting the detail of secret service
men to duty outside of their own
bureaus.
The resolution was -adopted and
Messrs. Perkins, New York; Denby,
Michigan: Weeks, Massachusetts; Wil
liams, Mississippi, and Lloyd, Missouri,
were appointed on the committee.
Republican senators today consid
ered what action should be taken by
the senate concerning the message of
tlie president, and it was practically
decided to permit the resolution to be
brought in by some democratic senator.
The resolution will provide for an
investigation of the whole subject by
the senate committee on appropria
tions.
The text of Mr. Perkins" resolution
was as follows: •
Whereas, there was contained in
the sundry civil appropriation bill
\u25a0which passed congress at its last :
session and became a law, a pro- I
vision in reference, to the employ
ment of the secret service in the \
treasury department, and
in the message of the ;
president of the United States to"
\u2666 the two houses of congress it was
stated in reference to that pro- ':
"It is not to* much to say that '
this amendment has been of benefit
only and could be of benefit only
to in© criminal classes," and it was
further stated: "The chief argu
ment in favor of the provision was
that the congressmen did not them- "
selves want to be investigated by
secret service men." And it was
further stated: "But if this is not
considered desirable a special ex
ception could be made in the law,
prohibiting the use of the secret \
service force in investigating mem
bers of congress. It. would be far
better to do this than to do what '
actually was done, and strive to
prevent or at least to hamper ef
fective action* against criminals by, '
the legislative^branch of the gov
ernment." Now, therefore, be it
Resolved, that a committee of
live members of congress of this
bouse be appointed by the speaker
to consider the statements con
tained in the message of the presi- .
dent and report to the house what
\u25a0action, if any, should be taken in
reference thereto.

\u25a0 This moving the Ruef case will
again be' called in Judge Lawlor's court

dict returned Thursday by Jthe juryin
the trolley bribery trial. District At
torney Langdon stated yesterday that
the prosecution will not ask for any de

Patrick Calhoun will be the next of

by District Attorney Langdon- himself.

that the prosecution was ready to pro
ceed to trial and Stanley Moore, repre
senting Calhoun, declared that the de
fendant stood ready, subject only to
allowing sufficient time to elapse to ar
range his affairs In the east. O'Gara
said that an. agreement had been made
that notice should be given and that
the prosecution had no intention to ab T
rogate the agreement. Both O'Gara
and Moore expressed themselves as
willing that a date for the beginning of
trial Ehould be set at»once, but Judge
L«awlor. refused to make any "formal'or
der in the absence of the defendant
himself. . * "
WIIX SUM3IOX CALHOUX .

once with his client and today an
agreement will be reached as to the
date on which the cases shall again be

foretold in , The Call, to trace Wilson's
actions on the afternoon of December

Slispect's Story Disproved
, Wilson was first asked'to account for
his movements. ; He said' that during
the noon hour (Boas and he Went to
lunch together at the B and D restauf
rant, 'in . Third street near Mission," a
place \u25a0; vrhere 'they were, both- : well
known. He said that they left' the res
taurant after 1:30 o'clock in the after
noon, arid that- from there' lie Went .to
Joseph 'Thieban's electrical supply
house, 555 Mission street, a block and
a half away, where he transacted some
business.. From there, he said, he went
to see a. man named Compert at 642
Shradcr street, where he "delivered a
package of electric lamps. Compert was
not; at home and the bundle was left
with S. ; C,ohn; a barber, with a shop at
652 Shrader street.
Upon investigation the police found
flaws in Wilson's story. It was learned
that -he left the restaurant' before il
o'clock and even- that he was nt Thic

stenographers viand a porter at Thie

there before 1' o'clock..
Movements Not Explained
'„- Cohn has told the police that Wilson
did not reach his shop until 4:30 o'clock.'
Wilson has been unable, the police say,
to account for his movements in the

THREATS OF DEATH
WRITTEN AS JOKES
Author Says He Organized the k
"Knights of White Death"
for Amusement
Police Secure Confession From
Prisoner Who Denies Plot
to Blackmail Clergy
CHICAGO. Dec. 11. — The mystery ot
the -Knights of the White Death" let
ters that were recently sent to various
clergymen and prominent citizens in
this city, with the threat that unless
they left large sums of money at. des
ignated spots they; wyuld be put to
death, was cleared up tonight whea
William Polla»d. 2-' years old. driver of
a- grocer's wagon, was arrested and,
confessed to having sent the missives
as a'joke.
Pollard blamed Conan Doyle's stories
of crime for his exploit. Fascinated by
the novelist's lurid pictures Pollard de
clared he had 'determined to see how
they would work out In the hands oC
the Chicago police.- So he organized
the "Knights of the White Death" and
with a Sherlock Holmes fancy wrote
out a bundle of letters, decorated with,
skulls and crossbones.
The demands of money, he said,
were simply added to enliven the mys
tery, as he never went to see whetlier
the money was left or not He sent
coffin nails and trimmings with the \e'.-r
ters. *. Pollard said in his confession: f
"How did I get the human bones and
the coffin trimmings? That was easy.
When they. dig a new grave. ln Calvary
cemetery the graves are so crowded to
gether that the side- of .an old grave
often caves in and portions of the Inter
ment fall Into the new excavation,
which Is then thrown out .with the new
sand. At night I went Into the ceme
tery and gathered these things.
"After I had sent that coffin handle to
Rev. Mr. Waters. I was afraid they
would trace It to Calvary cemetery, be
cause of the cross on it. Besides those
to the clergyman I sent letters to As
sistant Chief of Police Schuetler, telling
the latter to leave 5700 in the confes
sional box. of St. Charlotte's church. I
was delighted when I read that Dr.
Dixon and the detectives stood waiting
almost all night for the White Knights
to appear for the money.".
