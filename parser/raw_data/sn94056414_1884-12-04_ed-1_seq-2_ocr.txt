DASTARDLY DESERTION. J. D. Hollister ,
who has figured In the trco business in this
part of the state for the past two years , left
suddenly on Saturday for parts unknown ,
leaving his fond wtfo to buffet life's cares
alone. The twain were stopping at Columbus
when bo took the notion that he had special
business in North Bend that demanded imme
diate attention , and as sbo was not feeling
well ho proposed to go alono. Ho came to
North Bend , settled all his business , drew all
his money from the bank , cashed all bis notes
that ho could discount and decamped for
other , if/not more congenial climes. Ho loft
$100 in tbo "bank to her credit and turned over
to her a few notes that ho could not discount ,
pocketing1 tbo balance for future use. This
desertion seems all the more cruel from the
fact that she had furnished him his coat and
bat in which ho was married , and all the
moneyTia had used in his business , amount
ing in all to ? 2,700. North Bend Flail.

ng a drop in new mixed corntoIEVi cents and

mi on one of the oil cars was burned off and

muled under a water tank and the flames
vere extinguished.

rcr trains near Schuyler last month. Heldt is
bo man who gave the information of both

he trains. His object was to gain the good
vill of the company by giving valuable inf or-
nation , then getting a job at big wages in
lunting down the offenders. Heldt was de-
:6yed : in Omaha on the latter errand. Ho told
lis story at the Union Pacific headquarters

ectivc Neligh , has been examined at Schuy-
er and held to bail in $8,000. The prisoner
ms made a confession which closely sub-
tantiates the theory advanced at the time
hat ho was arrested. His admission is this :
'Regarding this wrecking transaction I have
o say that I did it myself. I wish the com-
any also to know that before God I did not
ntend that any lives should be lost or any
ithcr damages occur if I could help it ; but I
inly wanted to gain favor with the company
0 as to get money out of them if possible or
1 job of work , which I need , as I am out of
mployment. 1 am willing to swear to the
bove. "

The Egyptian muddle bos assumed a pain

m the horns of a dilemma. If the only course
s token which will be acceptable to the
powers , the tax payers at homo will vigorous-
y resist it.
Paris dispatch : The cholera has been
dandled very well in Paris. The majority of
the cases in the hospitals have been cured.
Ehe difficulty with the remainder has been
that either the patient's system had already
Seen ruined by alcohol or privation , or that
he patient arrived at the hospital too late.
Cho latter Is really the chief trouble every
where. Dr. Chapman's treatment with ice
jags on the spine and Dr. Hyera's venous in-
eetion of salt solution both have been suc-
: essful. The epidemic in Paris is near the
; nd , and in the suburbs of the cityissub-
iding.

CAPITAL BRIEFS.
The secretary of the interior calls attention
to the necessity for some legislation to com
pel the railroad companies having earned the
land granted to them to take a patent there
for , so that the states or territories in which
such lands Ho may have the benefits derived
from taxing the lands withintheirboundaries.
Army men have received another surprise
in the appointment by the .president of An
drew Brcwster , a stepson of the attorney gen
eral , and William Mason Wright to bo second
lieutenants. Following upon the recent ap
pointments from civil life to the army , which
were criticised so severely , the action of Pres
ident Arthur creates surprise.
The first official recognition of the fact that
Governor Cleveland has been elected presi
dent occurred at the bureau of engraving
and printing of the treasury department the
other day , when the president-elect was writ
ten asking him for a copy of his photograph
so that an engraving of his head could bo
made for the bureau at the New Orleans expo
sition.
The attorney general in his annua report
directed the attention of congress to the want
of proper legislation for criminal cases. In
preparing indictments , ho says , for offenses
against the United States It is found necessary
to follow the common law forms of the last
century , with all its technicalities , verbosity
of descriptions , repetition and precision of
statements formerly required , whereby that
which should be a timple and concise written
accusation becomes a lengthy and painfully
confused mass of descriptions and allegations ,
wholly unintelligible to the defendant , who is
called upon to answer , or to the jury selected
to try the case. The attorney general points
to evils , omissions and defects in the present
lawin cases of murder , manslaughter , lurceny.
demurrers , motions to quash , challenges , etc. ,
and submits a draft of a bill designed to afford
a remedy.
Cleveland Determined to Protect All Interests
to theUest of His Ability.
The Albany correspondent of the Philadel
phia Times reports Governor Cleveland as
using the following language touching the
policy that will guide the administration after
March 4th , : "No harm shall come to any busi
ness interest as a result of the administrative
power as long as I am president. I intend to
surround myself with the best and broadest
minds in the party , and then bond nil my en
ergies toward making an administration that
shall at least assure every element that trans
fer of executive control from one party to nn
other does not mean anv serious disturbance
of existing conditions. It is almost incredible
that there should be any feeling of uncertain
ty whatever as to the future , so far as the re
cent result of the election is concerned. Those
who are to succeed to power by the will ot the
people , as recently expressed , are as much in
terested in the future of the [ Jnitcd States as
they who wield it. They also have an equal
stake in the prosperity and advancement of
the country. They are as thoroughly com
mitted to the maintenance of values and us
earnestly anxious for sterling business pros <
perity ns their opponents. Naturally they
will be careful oboutpronouncinglor a policy
inimical to the interests of the very class
which , more than ony other , hns thus honored
them with its confidence. Coming into power
after so long an absence , the party ought , and
will so far as the executive is concerned , bring
liberal views and good Impulses into control
of the government. It would be unnatural
for the party not to be nctuntod by a desire to
continue in power by demonstrating that it
deserves the highest confidence of the people.
This it cannot do if it would unsettle business
and make factious war upon well conceived
plans of government. This is the view I take
of the proper posi ! Ion for the party just as
suming control of the country in a crisis like
this , and the standard by which I shall bo
guided while in the presidential office.If I
follow it , I hope for and expect a fair
nnd honest response from the republicans
with whom 1 may have relations , as well
as the hearty support of my own party.
I feel , of course , I have great responsibilities ,
nnd approach them with : i feeling of m' re or
less anxiety. While I know there is no reason
what over for this feeling of restlessness north
or south. I cannot but realize that all minds no
not see things in the same light. What may
seem of no moment to one may be of great
consequence to another. The democratic
party and its servants ore as much committed
to n careful policy upon economic questions
as their opponents , nnd they will be ns cai et'iil
to act for the best interests of the country as
the repuLa'caus would had they been success
ful. I assume , therefore , that whatever of
nervousness is now apparent comes simply
from the disturt since of the long lease of
power , and that whenever tbeirritation. crow
ing out of defeat , hns passed otT , there will be
a better feeling all around and n willingness
to give the new men a fair and honest chance.
That Is all that is desired and less would not
be fair to the incoming administration. "
In the course of an interview with n reprel
ecntntivo of a Boston paper. President-elect
Cleveland , speakingof the business and manu
facturing Interests , said : "It goes without'
enying that the democratic pnrty is made up
of merchants , business men and worklngmen ,
and everybody certainly desires good times
and realizes that all the people must be pros
perous to ensure that result. We have fifty-
live million people , nlmost boundless re
sources , hundreds of the strongest financial
Institutions in the world , thousands of enter
prising merchants , the most skillful manufac
turers , and the most intelligent farmers nnd
workingmen on the face of the earth. Now ,
surely , a country with these characteristics
has every qualification for solid and perma
nent prosperity. It will be my aim and the
aim of all associated with me in the conduct
of affairs at Washington , to give the people
of the United States a safe , economical and
conservative government. The fact that so
many business men and manufacturers and
workingmen voted with the democratic party
this election shows that they were not nfrnid
of a change in tbe administration. The demo
cratic party , in its Chicago platform , meant
What it said , and said what it meant , and will
carry the provisions of that platform which
relate to the business interests of the country
nto effect. The most important thing lt > to
restore confidence and a determination to ferret -
ret partisan heat and excitement , and devote
our lives to things which tend to substantiate
the welfare of the country and nil of its peo-
) le. In this work every man fchould feel ho
ias a part to perform. "
The President's Message.
The president has his message well under
way. He hns rend the outlines of his recom-
mendntions to the cnbinet at the last two cab-
net meetings , and has discussed the changes
uggested by them. A memorandum furnish
ed by gentlemen of the cabinet for various
mrts of the message have all been received
ma arranged in order. Secretary McCol-
ough has been fully consulted on all ques-
lens of finance , and appears in perfect
accord with the president. It is known that
he president will a&ain discuss the subject of
our relations with the South American powers ,
giving the whole matter grenter space nnd
attention than was ever before given it in any
nessage. It is said in this connection that
he policy outlined in Blnine's letter of accept
ance will receive the full endorsement of 'the
'resident. ' In compliance with the wishes of
Secretary McCuIlough , the message will urge
vith distinct emphasis a reduction of the sur
plus in the treasury. Secretary Chandler's re-
uest , cordially endorsed by Secretary Lin-
oln , that congress be asked to pension the
urvivors of the Grecly party , will nlso the
somplied with.

A Convention of Colored Men.
A mass meeting- colored citizens was held
it Atlanta , Go. , to conslder.the effect of a
change of administration on the colored peo-
jle of the south. By request Senator Colqultt
spoke. He said the two races would now be
Drought nearer together and would under
stand each other better than ever before. He
issured the colored men their rights would be
uarded as zealously by the democratic state
ind national administrations as if they were
vhite. Letters were read from Governor Mc-
Daniel and Senator Brown. Speeches were
ilso made by H. H. Tucker and Mayor Good-
vin. Governor Cleveland's recent utterance
insuring the negroes every ripht they possess
iliould be protected bv hisndministration was
ead and received with cheers.

secretary of the navy on the subject of the
navy appropriation for the final sir months of
the current fiscal year. It Is thought probable
the last year's appropriations will be contin
ued for that period , as it was done last session
for the six months from July 1st , and that the
question of making an appropriation for tie
proposed new cruisers , on which the two-
houses came to a dead-lock last session , will
be loft for the next congress. Randall , how
ever , would not express an opinion on this
subject or as to any part of the policy of the
commlttee , remarking simply he did not yet
know what would be done.
COXKLLNO TO DEMOCRACY.
His Anstcer to the Committee that Sought
His Professional Services.
Following is the letter the democratic
national committee sent to ex-United States
Senator Conkling , asking his services as coun
sel during the canvass of the votes of the re
cent election :
"NEW YORK , November 8 , 1884. Mr Dear ft
Sir : There seems to be reason to apprehend a-
design to involve in litigation and uncertainty
the presidential election in this state and per
haps elsewhere- The democratic commlttces-
liavc no doubt of the result of the election and ,
wish to establish the exact truth in the mode- ,
prescribed by law. At the same time the wish ,
is strong to spare the country a period of agitation -
tation and excitement. We ask you , as coun
sel , to give such advice and suggest such action -
tion as will aid in the prompt and lawful ascerX
tainment of the truth. This is all we mean
ourselves and all we shall expect of you. Yours-
truly , W. E. SMITH , ?
Chairman Executive Committee.
Hox. ROSCOE CONKLING , No. 2. Wall street , .
New York City. *
Mr. Conkling replied as follows :
NEW YORK , November 10,18S4. i
MY DEAR SIR : Your letter of the day before - J
fore vesterday has been carefully considered. I
I am'in full -iccord with the purposes you de
clare. Nothing could be more plainly hurtful
to the state of New York and the country than
a successful attempt to confuse and ensnarl
the result of the late presidential election.
The modes of the law , quietly and honestly ob
served , will quickly reveal and establish the-
actual truth. To assist in assuring this , Is a
clear duty resting on everv citizen regardless-
of his party attachments. I am at the service
of your committee for all in my power in this
behalf , and for all I can do to prevent and op
pose any effort to dispute by technicalities the
verdict which has been rendered , or to hinderer
or delay its acccptancce.
Your obedient servant ,
ROSCOE COXKLING.

Committee.

FEXCIXG PUBLIC ZAXDS.
IF/Jtit the Secretary of the Interior Says Con
cerning the Same. T
In my last annual report I called attention
o numerous complaints made concerning the *
llegal fencing of the public land , and -urged ' ,
iome legislation by which such illegal fences '
night be summarily removed without delay i
ind expense of a suit in court. I regret to say * % ? i
hat congress has so far failed to take action
> n this subject. A number of suits have been
nstituted by the department of justice at the-
equest of this department , to compel thenar-
ies to remove such fences , but such proceed-
ng involve much time and delay , and if the-
mrties defendants desire to continue In posses
Ion of such fenced lands , appeals will betaken
o the supreme court of the United States , and
he government put to great expense , and the
ands withheld from occupation under the-
ettlement laws. I trust that some legislation
nay be had that will enable the department f
n a . . . , to
summary way * " * destroy these fences
L'hnro the builders refuse to take them .tJ."W .O i
t has been claimed by some that the power
xists in the department to destroy thepp-
ences as obstructions on the public lands. If
his is so the department has no means at its
isposal to pay the expenses of removal
leitherhns the department of justice. Aul
honty should be given to remove suchob-
tructions. and provisions made for the navl
wnt of the persons employed to do such
rorlc.
