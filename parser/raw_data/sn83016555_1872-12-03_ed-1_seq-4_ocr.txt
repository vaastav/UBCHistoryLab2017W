MAYOR WILTZ'S INAUGURAL MESSAGE.
We have read with great attention the
inaugural message of Mayor Wiltz, and
find that the pleasure derived from the
elegant diction employed is to a great ex
tent neutralized by the difficulties 'discov
ered and suggested by the new Mayor.
In the outset, he exhibits to the Council a
catalogue of the wonderful things expected
of the new administration, but which he
appears to have found out since his elec
tion to be "far more than can be by any
means accomplished, and more than can
now he promised." There is nothing left,
therefore, but to "solicit the patient in
dulgence and considerate forbearance of
all friends of reform." To all which the
Republican has merely to remark that
there is no cause for surprise tLat the task
which seemed to be so easy of accomplish
ment before the election, should loom up
into formidable proportions after it. The
evils that exist in our municipal system
are chronic, and arise from other causes
than political mismanagement. Until Mr.
Wiltz is fully able to comprehend the un
derlying principle, he will be powerless to
carry out any part of the magnificent
programme which the Reformers have so
far merely desired, without the remotest
conception of where the means were to
come from to accomplish it.
The message informs the people that
the real estate of the city has declined
more than thirty per cent since 18C7,
which fact is cited as one of the chief dif
ficulties in the way of the administration;
yet further on, when he comes to give us
his statistical information, he throws dis
credit upon his own statement by showing
that the total valuation of property in
1867 was 8121,030,000 and 8158,214,000 at
the present time, which shows an increase
of over 837,000,000, instead of a decrease
of thirty per cent. Yet, in spite of this
apparent increase in value, the average
productive value of property has probably
decreased to some extent, though there
has been a small increase in the number
of improved premises. And here is the
main cause of the financial difficulty.
Property that has been rendered unpro
ductive by reason of its location or want of
judgment in the owner is still held at ante
bellum prices, with no market. The
owner holds on to what he considers its
intrinsic value long after its exchangeable
value has gone far below it. It is accord
ingly taxed for more than the income de
rived from iL Tliis tax is, of course, not
paid. The owner goes into the tax resist
ing business, and ascribes to radical mis
management the evils which he or his
real estate agent Lave let come upon him.
Mr. Wiltz plainly recognizes the futility
of all attempts at reform unless backed
up by promptness in taxpaying. His
first and most pressing demand, theiefore,
is a return to the "cash system." But this
is easier to suggest than to carry out. Un
less he can devise a plan to make property
more profitable to the owners, they will
not imbibe the taxpaying enthusiasm to
any great extent, nor find it easier to push
the load up the hill for the disciples of
abstract reform than it was for the Radi
cals. Those superficial thinkers who ex
pected an immediate sensation of relief
vith the inauguration of an anti-Radical
city administration felt a measure of dis
ppointment, therefore, when Mr. Wiltz
suggested the plan of reform indicated
persistently by the Republican— prompt
payment of taxes and reduction of ex
penses. One portion of Mr. Wiltz's con
stituents look with disfavor upon any
lan that requires them to put their hands
into their pockets, while another portion,
the rank and file, hold there are too few
offices already to give them all a place.
Aside from these drawbacks there is
much interesting information in .the mes
sage. We learn there that the property of
the city, valued at $158,000,000, is liable
for a municipal debt of $21,000,000, and
three-fifths of the .State debt, set down at
$42,000,000 (which is too high), making
$25,500,000 more. Besides this, there are
suits already pending, or imminent, for
licenses improperly paid, running back
for several years, which will foot up
84,000,000 or $5,000,000 more, making an
aggregate of actual and contingent liabili
ties of more than fifty millions, equal to
nearly one-third of the total value of the
property in the corporate limits. If this
be a correct statement of the cash account,
we can only see two ways to get out of the
difficulty—one to wait for a miracle and
the other to repudiate. But the ease is
really not so bad as is made to appear.
The claims upon the city property are, so
great as to almost amount to stagnation,
but in the face of all of them, the actual
values may be augmented by wise meas
ures. It is not in the power of politicians
to render any relief. Economy may be
employed as a most useful auxiliary, but
the man who has no income must go
further than economy. He must study
thrift. Every avenue by which profit may
come to this almost stagnant market
should be kept open. We must begin at
the roots, whence increase may be ex
pected, as well as to watch and save at the
branches. But this often tried system of
top-dressing will not afford that measure
of relief which ■ our reformers have led
"this people" to believe would instantly
follow tlie inauguration of the new plan of
salvation.
TEE CASE 0? KELLOGG VS. WARM0TE
AND OTHERS.
The argument in this very interesting
and highly important case was continued
yesterday in the presence of a large num
ber oi citizens, llandeil Hunt, Esq., con
cluded the debate for the delense, and was
followed by E. O. Billings, Esq., in sup
port ol the prosecution. The high repu
tation these gentlemen have reaped in their,
profession was well sustained l.y their
efforts to throw light upon the matter un
der consideration. Mr. Hunt's reputation
as a skillful lawyer and close reasoner was
well established long before the civil war
broke out which has surrounded us with a
condition of things we are now endeavor,
ing to settle. Mr. Billings is a much
younger man, and lias made his reputation
at the New Orleans bar? principally in the
federal courts, since the close of the war.
They are men of strong, clear minds, but
Mr. Hunt's fervid style appeals more sen
sibly to the passions, while Mr. Billings'
clear, cool and forcible style works keenly
upon the judgment of men.
In opening the argument yesterday, Mr.
Hunt observed that the very able counsel
who had preceded him for the defense,
had left very little that was necessary for
him to say, so fully had they met every
point to be considered in the case under
consideration. He fully concurred in all
they had said, and proceeded to argue at
length, in his own way, the points at issue,
devoting most of his time to that point
which involved the eligibility of Mr. Kel
logg to become Governor. He denied that
he was eligible and quoted a good deal of
authority in support of this position. Un
fortunately for Mr. Hunt, this proved
"love's labor lost," as Judge Dure 11 an
nounced, while Mr. Billings was arguing
the same point, that Governor Claiborne,
who had been appointed Territorial Gov
ernor of Louisiana, by President Jefferson,
was, whU acting as such, elected first
Governor of the State of Louisiana. If
we understood Judge Durell correctly, he
regarded this precedent as nullfying the
objections that were being urged against
Mr. Kellogg's eligibility to become Gover
nor because he was a United States Senator
when a candidate for Governor. But of
course this should not detract from the
very able effort made by Mr. Hunt to
establish the ineligibility of Mr. Kellogg.
The veteran advocate no doubt thought
this the weak point of the prosecution,
and if the defense succeeded in establish
ing it there would be but little trouble in
putting a stop to the proceedings insti
tuted by Mr. Kellogg in behalf of himself
and the Republicans of Louisiana. Mr.
Hunt spoke with great feeling through
out, and manifested a great love for
American institutions and reverence
for the founders of American gov
ernment. He was followed by Mr.
Billings, who spoke for about an
hour, meeting in a masterly manner two
or three of the points made by counsel for
the defense. These were "jurisdiction,"
"eligibility" and "constitutionality" of the
enforcement law, under which the case
was proceeding. He read thene^ amend
ments to the constitution and portions of
tne enforcement laws that give authority
for the suit under consideration, and
analyzed the same. He also went into a
history of the cause which had produced
the necessity for the changes in the con
stitution and that appropriate legislation
which is intended to secure the enforce
ment of the same. So far as the argu
ment of Mr. Billings proceeded, it was a
complete answer to all that had been said
by opposite counsel. It will be concluded
to-day.
KELLOGG'S ELIGIBILITY SETTLED.
The fusion journals have hammered
away at the question of Senator Kellogg's
eligibility to the governorship of Louisi
ana until mental prostration gave their
readers timely relief. The learned coun
sel for the defense, in the great suit of
Kellogg vs. Warmoth. exhausted their elo
quence, and pretendediy their research,
in the effort to establish that the plaintiff
could not legally assume the executive
powers. In all of which, both the organs
and the lawyers, have displayed a wofu!
ignorance of the history of Louisiana, or
been guilty of a very shallow attempt to
deceive.
A very few words, incidentally uttered
for the enlightenment of the counsel, by
the learned jurist occupying the United
States Circuit Court bench, seem to have
dissipated yesterday, even from their
minds, ail doubt as to the proper construc
tion of the constitutional provision under
which this threatening contest has been
made. At the time of the transition of
Louisiana from a Territory to a State,
Governor Claiborne filled the executive
chair, and he changed from a federal to a
State officer without interregum in the
discharge of his duties. Had he been in
eligible, would not the framers of the con
stitution have then raised objections
during the canvass and at the period of
his installation as Governor of the State?
There can be no doubt, from this alone,
and passing by tbe many other illustrative
facts cited by Counselor Billings in behalf
of his'client, that the framers of our State
constitution designed solely to prevent tbe
holding by one person, at the same time,
of both State and federal office, in order
that divided allegiance should not work
injury and embarrassment where a conflict
of interests might c-Qine up for determina
tion. This, too, is the common sense view
of the case, for it is not at all probable
that any people would willingly deprive
themselves of the services and talents of a
citizen peculiarly fitted to manage their
more immediate local interests because he
might have developed peculiar adapta
bility for the trust in another, official
sphere to which they had previously as
signed him.
We have never regarded the question of
Mr. Kellogg's elegibility as essential to the
maintenance of his case now pending; but
the opposition from the first laid great
stress thereupon. May we not justly draw
ifort, : : : n, it m the mai
weak:, -s of one of the jriu :ipal «tavs to
A CHANCE FOR RANDELL HUNT,
Counselor Randell Hunt is a great
stickler for the purity of the ballot, thus
proving himself an exception to the fn
sienists generally, they having shown a
most decided leaning the other way since
the power of defiling the ball ot came into
their possession. Not or.ee, but a score of
times, did the learned gentleman declare
yesterday in the United States Court, that
the corner stone of American liberty is the
voice of the people, and that when the
popular voice.ceased to be heard, our
form of
government
will hi
from Re]
publican
to a
. despot;:
Those
are our
sent
inients
we call u
:pon Mr.
Hu
nt to at
front in
the pres
ent
contest,
dearly enlisted on the wrong side.
We have informally, and before long it
will be judicially, proven that the ten
thousand majority which he boasts Me
Enery received are not a delusion simply—
fraud—a deliberately planned and ex
ecuted fraud. How will Mr. Hunt, filled
with patriotic and honest emotions as he
declares, feel when he finds himself to
have been engaged in stifling the voice of
the people? Surely, remorse will seize him
sorely.
Nor 'need ne long remain in doubt. If
he will but step into the marshal's office
and read the vast accumulation of sworn
testimony, which establishes beyond the
shadow of a doubt that the pretended
election of his friend is a vile and unmiti
gated swindle, his mind will at once be
clear as to his duty. In Bossier, Caddo,
Rapides, Madison, East Baton Rouge,
Natchitoches and many other parishes,
thousands upon thousands of the very
class whom he thanked God had been
emancipated and made citizens were
cbeated of their voice in the election.
Not only cheated of their right to be
heard, but in an immense number of cases
their decision stolen, and the reverse of
their expressed will substituted. Mr.
Hunt should lose no time in examining
the proofs, and then raising his voice on
the side of right and of the law. He will
be welcomed as a powerful auxiliary.
TEE END OF TAX RESISTING.
The pressure is too great upon the
Picayune to permit it to keep up its tax
resisting advice. It now urges taxpayers
to come up to the captain's office and set
tle, with all the power to dun of a poor
country editor who knows no other kind
of literature. There is no hint of resist-"
ing the tax collector now. We are ad
monished that the officers who are charged
with public disbursements have been
elected by the people, and are pledged to
retrenchment and economy. There are
those who expected that the first evi
dences oi reform would be an entire re
mission of taxes,-and that the new officers
would be able to gather greenbacks
enough from the trees in Lafayette square
to run the government. When the organ
of the reformers, therefore, curtly expects
that the invitation of Mayor Wiltz to
come up and pay promptly " will
be met in a responsive spirit
every good citizen and reformer. " Many
people who have always supposed them
selves to be good citizens, wore a look of
disappointment and displeasure. They
begin to find out that our interpretation of
reform pfoves to be correct—that it means
the substitution of one set of officials for
another, with a pretty close observance of
precedents. As soon as there was so
prospect for this change, certain parties
who expected to come in as beneficiaries
raised the cry of tax resistance, for the
purpose of saving for themselves as much
of the public money as possible. Thus we
shall hear but little more of reform Ad
less of tax resisting from that quarter un
til there is another change in the adminis
tration.
AN OMISSION.
Randell Hunt, Esq., in bis ornate ora
tion before Judge Durell, drew a vivid and
gross of this country ia the arts, sciences
and material wealth, until "the baleful at
tempt at secession " cast a blight over the
land. Webster's eloquence was drawn
upon to suitably frame Lis idea, and the
glory and greatness of America's histori
c dly foremost men cited in proof that
only by patriotic love of country and de
votion to the constitution and laws can
such an altogether lovely condition of af
fairs be re-established as existed in their
day. His hearers, while under the magic
of his eloquence, might justifiably have
imagined that old father Time could
be made to take a back seat, and "the
good old days '* when great and unselfish
men ruled the nation's destinies be at
one? restored, if only Judge Durell would
decide for the able advocate's client.
But when Counselor Hunt's ringing
tones had ceased, and his thrilling appeals
to the feelings gave way to sober reflec
tion, a noticeable omission was discovera
ble. He had failed entirely ta notice that
a part of the people degenerated until
they so lar forgot the noble example and
patriotic precepts of the fathers of the
republic, whose memory the learned
orator so ardently reveres, that they
raised their impious hands against the
life of the republic he loves, and sought to
rend in atoms that constitution which he
declares is the highest achievement of hu
man wisdon.
That degeneracy received a severe cor
rective: and a remedy against a recurrence
of the monstrous wrong attempted was
endeavored to be provided. This remedy
is now undergoiog a practical test: and if
Mr. Hunt's position is correct, it is a fail
ure, and Congress will have to try it over
again.
IS TEE SUPREME COURT A POWER ?
The Times conveyed a very broad inti
mation a week ago that the constitutional
provision relating to the term of Secretary
of Mate would be ignored by the Gov
ernor. and Armstead, the fusion candi
date. commissioned to that office. This
move appeared to hinge on the decision
of the Supreme Court upon the applica.
tion of Bovee for reinstatement into the
office from which he had been forcibly
expelled; and since the result has been
declared in his favor, we are net surprised
to - hear the report referred to revived.
The resort to such measures is tyranni
cal and revolutionary, and descrying the
reprobation of all who do not desire to
see ewry check and obstacle removed from
the ambitious will of whoever may here
after seize the executive powers of the
State. Yet, at the same time, the threat
ened usurpation is not without its encour
aging features. It augurs a desperate de
termination to accomplish the fusion elec
tion scheme at all risks: but it shows a
desperation driven to. the wall, and grasp
ing at every hazardous chance for aid and
relief. We have great hopes that the plot
to subvert the will of the majority in
Louisiana is now rapidly falling to pieces,
and that our personal and political liber
ties will pass through this hour of trial
safely.
There was also a report late last eve
ning tl-.t the remaining Supreme Court
look upon this as an idle rumor. We do
not believe even the wildest flight of ex
ecutive ambition ever contemplated so
daring a feat.
AN IMPORTANT STEP.
The United States Circuit Court, yester
day, on motion of the district attorney,
issued a writ of certiorari directing the
Eighth District Court of this parish to
transfer all papers and records relating to
the poiitical contest now going on between
the returning boards and the Governor to
the former—the federal—court.
The effect of this order we imagine will
be to quash the injunction issued by Judge
Elmore last Saturday against the Lynch
board, and serve as a notice to that offi
cial that, for the present at least, com-'
plete jurisdiction over this matter has
been assumed by a power entirely above
and beyond him. It is possible that the
action taken against the regular board
may complicate the question of contempt
of the restraining order issued by Judge
Durell, and add materially to the discom
forts of whoever may be found in default.
Governor Claiborne, the first chief mag
istrate of the State of Louisiana, and
whose election while holding the federal
appointment of Territorial 'Governor,
served to throw a flood of light upon a
vexed question of official eligibility in the
United States Circuit Court yesterday, was
the father, we believe, of the courteous,
popular and able gentleman who so ac
ceptably fills the post of clerk of the fed
eral District Court.
lion. Rande'll Hunt gave broad intima
tions yesterday that lie did not altogether
like his new associations, and took express
pains to prove to the court and his audi
tors that he did not appear for the Gov
ernor or the returning boards, but for
John McEnery, Esq., who previously had
not been known as a party to tbe suit.
