Washington Doc 1L President
Roosevelt sent his special message
on the Panama canal to congress
today The message Is as follows
L To tho Senate and House of Ileprc
tentative
tentativeOn
S On November 21 I visited tho Is
land of Porto Rico landing at Ponce
crossing by the old Spanish road by
Cayey to San Juan and returning
cnext morning over tho now Amen I
can road from Arcclbo to Pence the
scenery wa wonderfully beautiful
especially among tho mountains of
tho InterloY which constitute a van
S lIable tropic Switzerland I could not
embark at San Juan because the liar
bor has not bean dredged out and
can not receive an American battle
ship I do not think this fact credlta
blo to us as a nation and I earnestly
hope that Immediate provision will
ho made for dredging San Juan har
bor
J doubt Tvhcther our people as a
whole realize the beauty and fertility
I of Porto Illco and the progress that
4 has been made under Its admirable
government Wo have just cause for
pride In the character of our repro
sentatives who havo administered
1ho tropic Islands which camo unJer
ofJur flag as a result of the war with
Spain and of no one of them Is this
more true t than of Porto Rico It
would be Impossible to wish a more
faithful a more efficient and a more
disinterested public service than that
now being rendered In the Island of
Porto Rico by those In control of
0the Insular government
k JI stopt at a dozen towns all told
and ono of tho notable features In
every town was tho gathering of tho
school children The work that has
been done In Porto Rico for educa
lion has been noteworthy Tho main
emphasis l as Is eminently wise and
proper has been put upon primary
education but In addition to this
there Is a normal school an agricul
tural school three Industrial and
three high schools Every effort Is
Ibeing made to secure not only the
benefits of ijlcjiientary education to
all tho Porto Klcans of tho next gen
oration but alto as far as means will
t permit to train them so that tho In
dustrial agricultural and commer
i cial opportunities of the stand can
bo utilized to tho best possible ad
vantage It was evident at a glance
a that the teachers t both Americans
and native Porto RIcans were de
voted 10 their work took tho great
est pride In It and were endeavoring
to train their pupils not only In
mind but In what counts for far
more than mind In citizenship that
Is In character
I was very much struck by tho ex
cellent character both of the Insular
police and of tho Porto Rican regi
ment They aro both of them bodies
that reflect credit upon tho Amen
can administration of time Island Tho
Insulur police are under Limo local
Porto Rican government The Porto
Illcan regiment of troops must be ap
propriated for by congress I earnest
ly hope that this body will bo kept
permanent There should certainly
bo troops In tho Island and It Is wise
0that these troops should bo thorn
selves native Porte Ulcans It would
bo from vtvcry standpoint a mistake
not to pcrjcttitUo this regiment
In traversing the Island even tho
l most cursory survey leaves the be
holder struck with the evident rapid
growth In the culture both of tho
sugar cano and tobacco Tho fruit In
dustry Is also growing Last year was
time most prosperous year that the
Ifl Island l lias ever known before or
I since the American occupation The
total of exports and Imports of tho
Island was 4G millions of dollars as
against eighteen millions In 1901
This Is the largest in tho Islands his
4tory Prjor to tho American occupa
thin tho greatest trade for any ono
year was that of 1896 when It
reached nearly twentythree millions
of dollars 1

Farmers of the dark tobacco dls
inlet around Princeton are reaving
the whirlwind rowed by tho mob
which destroped the warehouses at
that place und financial ruin tares

of this act of vandrtllsm Tho effect
Is cornIng through the banks of t
Princeton which have been tho most
prosperous In western Kentucky
and the consequences bode 111 for the
f u turd of that city
It Is stated on good authority that
within tho last week the banka have
called In more than 100000 In loans
which affect probably jnono than 100
farmers Just at a season when they
need ready cash Many of them prob
ably by roanon of this pinching of the
purse strings will have some profit
able venture nipped In the bud
Others may losooll their BocurltlesHn
the way of real estate mortgageS and
there seems to Ite I no help for them
The Gallagher and Imperial tobac
companloa whoso warehouses wore
burned did f lOOOOOiO worth of burl
ness there a year They arc buying
300 hogsheads of tobacco a day and
Hhlpplng It out as fast as It com s In
Thoy aro withdrawing their accounts
Tobacco movements require fready
cash to meet tho deliveries and the
withdrawal of the companies funds
compel tho banks to fall back on their
debtors and they are pressing the
loans to paymc 1 > > JttptneotJhelF own

Farmers around Marlon Hopklns
vlllo and other places are liauKng
their tobacco through two or throe
counties to dispose of it Nobody
wilt loan money on tobacco In ware
houses or barns because both arc lia
ble to Incendiary fires
The farmers arc wrought In a con
dition of dlstros9 and Princeton
which was just enjoying an Incipient
boom with real estate active plans
for < a now railroad station nearing ful
fillment building going on and money
plenty has received a backset which
Is aflready being felt and from which
It may not recover for years
Some few of tho farseeing ones
among tho farmers are talking about
raising some crop other than tobacco
and tho prospects are that next year
will see a considerable decrease In

rlvo people were Injured and two
engines smashed at the Illinois Gen
ttal passenger station this morning
lu a collision between thQ Mcmptalii
Ioulsvlllo fast train and a light

The accident was caused by the air
brake ou the passenger engine refus
fag to work and preventing the en
gineer from slowing down as hq ap
proached tho Station from around the
curve of the Memphis division
Discovering bus air pump had stop
pad and Uls air supply exhausted
Engineer Mike Kelley pulling the
fast Illinois Central flyer 01011
from Memphis to Louisville blew his
distress rdgnali as ho rounded the
curve to tho station and reversed but
without avail ILls heavy train
crashed Into tho light engine stand
lag ahead of the Paducah passenger
depot nt 210 oclock this morning
and five persons were Injured In
rounding tho curve leading to the
depot the engine nearly turned over
and the rate of speed the train main
tamed Is said to have been fully 35
miles on hour Ketley was 30 min

M I Trice
TriceTho
Tho passenger train was due at
140 and at 210 oclock at the coal
chute Keller found his air defective
Ho saw his pump had stopped and
that his engine bad gotten beyond
control Several distress signals were
blown and Engineer Smith on the
waiting tight engine which was to
have taken the passenger train on to
Louisville started up He gave his
engine steam as fast as she would
take It but the rain made the tracks
slippery and tho engine barely mov
ing when rushing by the depot at at
least 35 miles an hour tho r heavy
passenger train crashed Into the light
engine
Tho tank of tho light engine was
smashed in and the pilot on the pas
senger engine crushed Passengers
In the cars wore thrown from their
berths and seats 4n utmost confusion
and none secaped minor hurts Rail
road physicians were on the scene ln
a few minutes
Pullman Conductor Westfall
caught his right hand In the door and
tluoe fingers were crushed BO the first
Joints had to be amputated
Jack Drunvtor of New York City
1 M West Fortieth street was thrown
from his berth In the sleeper and suf
fered severe bruises about the head
and severe sprains
L A Lehman a passenger of EI
llsvllle Miss was thrown from his
berth and sustained a badly bruised
head and neck
Tho flvemonthsold son of Mrs
Dotty Solars tiolconda Ilk was
bruised about the head
Fireman John WJlinghain of
1431 Jefferson street was thrown
from the cub of the passenger train
engine and his night wrist was
sprained and his face cut and bruited
The injuries are not serious except
to tho Pullman conductor Physic
tans made oil comfortable and as soon
as tho engines were separated and
the track cleared the train was sent
ahead with a fresh engine
There were many theories advanc
ed In explanation of the enure of the
wreck Kelley stated that the air i
pump failed to work This could i
readily havo caused the engine to get
beyond control Another Is that o
tramp riding tho blind bagpyg
turned thq angle cock and cut tho rvlr
off from the engine
