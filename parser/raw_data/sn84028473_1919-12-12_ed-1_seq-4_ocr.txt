PRESIDENT DEALS WITH
liBOfl PROBLEM AND H
C OF L IN MESSAGE
Wilson Dsccribes Conditions in
United States as Changed
and New
Washington Congress received
from President Wilson a reconstruc
tion message devoted solely to point
lng a course for domestic readjust
roent and recommending legislation
to make after war policies effective
Tho message sent from the presi
dents sick room and read separately
to tho two houses of the sixty sixth
congress marked tho formal turning
of executive attention from Issues of
war and international relations to tho
domestic problems of peaco Tho
treaty Is left to future consideration
Outstanding abovo all else was tho
emphasis placed by the president In
a discussion occupying a fourth of tho
whole message on what ho said
events have disclosed to bo the ab
solute need of a definite program to
bring about an Improvement In the
conditions of labor
Must Remove Grlevancet
The president finds bound up In
this problem tho threads of tho two
major national difficulties with which
tho country Is currontly confronted
tho abnormal cost of living and Indus
trial unrcBt For ho says thero can
bo no settled conditions leading to In
creased production and a reduction In
the cost of living it labor and capital
are to bo antagonists instead of part
ners and again the only way to
keep men from agitating against
grievances Is to remove tho grlor
ances
Therefore President Wilson recom
mends a genuine democratization of
Industry based on the full recognition
of the right of those who work In
whatever rank to participate In some
organic way In every decision which
directly affects their welfare
He declared there must bo recog
nition of tho fundamental concepts
for which labor has been struggling
through tho years and that tho wa7
to Industrial peace and conciliation Is
offered by establishment of the labor
principles laid down In tho covenant
of the league of nations
Conditions Are Changed
Tho president says flatly that ro
turn to the old standards of wago and
industry In employment Is unthink
able Ho proposes establishment of a
tribunal of arbitration to adjust dif
ferences between capital and labor
The essential fact that It is a re
construction message is mado clear
throughout tho document Tho presi
dent describes conditions as changed
and new making the point repeatedly
A fundamental change has taken
placo with reference to tho position of
America In the worlds affairs he
Bays
No policy of isolation will satisfy
tho growing needs and opportunities
of America
This is tho hour of tost and trial
for America
Tho problems with which tho presi
dent deals aro problems of futuro do
mestic arrangements improvement
of labor and governmental protection
of capital in emergencies suppres
sion of revolutionary agitation rural
development and commerco with re
gard to which the president recom
mends a freer trade with the world
In stern language he warns
apostles of revolution that this na
tion has no place for them or their
doctrines and ho arraigns them as
enemies of the nation
Important Recommendations
Among the most important recom
mendations made by tho president aro
the following
LABOR Improvement of conditions of
labor and democratization of industry
Including recognition of rlBht of collec
tive bargaining and the right to striko
except that there la a predominant right
of the government to protect all of ila
people and to assert Its power and ma
iesty against the challenge of any class

flown living costs Including extension of
food control act cold storage regulation
md provisions regarding Interstate com
merce
RADICALISM Legislation to check
not the free expression of opinion or ad
vocacy of orderly political change but

tions
