Mr Woldenberg
Wr yesterday met Mr. Barber, who
arrived on Monday from White Pine, at
which place he was engaged as night
foreman on the smutting works. He
states that the last ran of the furnace
was a good one, but was not a financial
success owing to the poor class of rock
bought, which hardly paid for the haul
iug. The ore shipped from here by the
American flag mine worked splendid,
If all of the ore had been of tba same
character the run would have been 1
grand success. Mr. Barber intends re
siding here during the Winter. Hu says
the late Ntriko m the Eherhardt, at
Treasure Hill, made last Thursday on
toe 4 i0 foot level of that mine, dips to
the east and is of such grade and char
aoter as to justify the hope that further
developments will give very favorable
indications.
Ii was reported yoiterday by parties
who seemed to credit the report that
Philip Klingen Smith had been mur
dered down in the vicinity or the Colo
rado river. We could learn uo particu
lars excep t that he was reported to have
made his way from Beaver down to that
vicinity all alone, preferring to trust to
the Indians and the dancers of the road
than to encounter any Mormons in his
travels. Ha entered a house down near
the ferry ot the Colorado to get his break
fast, and after getting through and com
ing out be was shot dead, as was sup
posed, by a Mormon. The affair is said
to have occurred about the 25th of No
vember. Ha has been threatened at
various times since the Lee trial, and
the late action of hostile parties teuds to
confirm the report.
Ball at Bullionvillb. This notice
is to inform all parties wishing to attend

and the vendor of fruit wanted the money
for them; she replied, "Me no oatohem

Snow, The hills about three miles
west of Pioche are covered with snow to
the depth of about three inches, so report

SENATE.
Washington, Deo. 7. At 12:13, on
motion of Senator Frelinghnysen of New
Jersey, the Senate took a recess until one
o'clock. Upon reassembling, Anthony,
from the joint oommittee to wait upon the
President and inform him of the organ
ization of the two houses, reported that
the President Bnid he would communi
cate with Congress immediately in writ
ing. At 1:15, Mr. Luckey, Private Sec
retary to the President, appeared at the
bar of the Senate with the message, and
it was read by Qeo. C. Oorham, Secretary
of the Senate. The reading was con
cluded at two o'clock, and was listened
to with marked attention by the Senators
and a largo audience in the galleries. Sir
Edward Thornton, British Minister, was
in the diplomatic gallery and appeared
deeply interested. Portions ot the mes
sage in regard to the school question,
taxation of church proparty, Cuba, our
financial affairs, and the condition of the
navy especially attracted the closest at
tention. On motion of Senator Conkling
of New York the message was ordered to
lay upon the table aud be printed. He
also offered the usual resolution to print
extra copies, which was referred to the
Committeo on Printing. The President
pro tern, laid before the Senate reports of
the various Cabinet officers and Con
troller of tho Currency which were or
dered printed and laid on the table.
Adjourned.
B0TJ8S.
On motion of S. J. Bandult of Penn.,
the House took a recess till one o'clock,
the hour fixed for the drawing of the
seats. At that hour the recess wa ex
tended to give the members abscut on the
committee to wait on the President
Cox, Knott and Blaine an opportunity
to be present and seleot their seats when
their names should be called. The ootir
tesy of allowing the oldest continuous
members to seleot seats in n.lv.inoa of
drawing was extended to Kelly. A mem
ber was also permitted to seleot a seat for
Alex. Stephens of Georgia. A 1 :15 Cox
reported the committee bad waited upon
the President and that a communication
in writing would be sent to the House
forthwith. The Speaker submitted the
question whether the House would draw
seats or have tbo President's mossage
read. The former course was adopted;
a blind folded page then drew the names
ot the members from the box one by one
and the member drawn came from the
outside bar, where all were congregated
and occupied the seat which he proposed
holding for the Congress. The first name
drawn was Whitehouse, and amongst the
first half dozen, Hoar, Ely and King.
The Democrats mostly took their seats
on the east side to the right of the
deer's chair the side which they
have partially occupied many Congresses.
Some however selected seats on the west
ern or Republican side of the Chamber.
Barnes selected the seat whioh be for
merly occupied, at the extreme loft, re
sisting the invitation of Blaine to take a
seat near bim, and in timated that the
atmosphere about there was too strong
for him. It was 2:20 when the drawing
was oompleted, As soon as order was
restored the President's message was re
oeived and presented to tho House, and
read by the Heading Clerk, Mr. Mehany.
The reading occupied two hours and five
minntes. At first tho message was lis
tened to with considerable interest and
attention, but after passing the portions
relating to education, church property
and Cuba, the attention began to flag;
members gradually retired, so that dur
ing the reading of the latter portion of
the message there were probably not
forty members in their Beats, and few of
those werj paying the slightest attention.
The message was ordered printed. Cox
presented the petition of W. H. Trescott
and others of South Carolina, with ref
erence to the right of representative of
the Third Congressional District of South
Carolina, and moved that it be referred
to the Committee on Elections; referred.
The House then adjourned till Friday.
Chicago, Deo. 8. A Washington spe
cial says the city, not less than the Honse,
is taken by surprise at the moderation of
the President's message in relation to
the Cuban question. It was known be
yond a doubt that General Grant had
been slowly maturing the purposo of
bringing the Spanish campaign in Cuba
to a crisis. His sympathies were openly
expressed, and to some extent assurances
given to the friends of Cuban independ
ence that an energotia protest should bo
addressed preparatory to the formal rec
ognition of belligerenoy on the part of
rebels. General Grant never appre
hended war ss the resnlt of this recogni
tion, it is alleged, hence, oa beginning
the message be bad olearly mads up his
mind to lay tha case plainly before the
oouutry avowing his sympathy with the
insurgents. A singular piece of inside
history has been made known. At the
eleventh bonr the Fish policy, as
it may be called, prevailed, and that
portion of the message which bad already
been written in accordance with the
President's strong inclination, beginning
at the seventh paragraph of that section
pertaining to our relations with Cuba
was obliterated and the present utter
ances substituted. The Republicans are
naturally unwilling to discuss the
matter, but, as understood by those
familiar with tha political changes going
on within the party, that the interests of
the Republican future demand an end of
entangling or outside alliances and that
any policy involving war or rumors of
war tends to distract the country and
shake confidence in the party in power.
It is known that the changes referred to
in the message were only brought about
after the election ot Kerr, which not only
alarmed the ring and subsidy people,
but warned the Republican leaders that
tha Democratic party is for the time-
being at least resolved npon the policy
of wisdom and conservatism. Had Ran
dall been elected there oan be no doubt
from the evidence at hand that General
Grant would not havo been urged by this
virtual canons of the Republican leaders
to forego his intention of a Cesarean
policy in settling the Cuban trouble.
while the Democrats are obagrined at
the escape of tho administration from
the dilemma in which prononnoed action
would have placed them. Thoro is
wrath beyond expression in tbe ranks of
those credulous believers in Cuban free
dom who have invested in insurgent
bonds and Havana oorner lots. This
class is by no means a limited one; there
is and has been for the last four years
a Cuban ring which has possessed itself
of many of tbe important papers ot the
oonntry to plead tha cauBe of the
dwindling rebellion whioh oalls itself the
Cuban Government. Whatever General
Grant's interest in Cuban freedom may
be beyond his sympathy with the strug
gling armies it is not probable that the
same motives which nrged bim to the
San Domingo acquisition wore not alto
gether ignored in bis new venture. En-
oouraged by the election of Kerr and tha
tractable spirit of the Southern members
the National Democratic Executive Com
mittee now in session has arranged a
plan of action for the guidance of Con
gress and the future of the party. It
has been resolved that Congress shall
grant no subsidies this Winter and shall
vigorously diminish appropriations and
ourrent Government expenses; that in
vestigations in all forms of Government
expenditures shall at once be set on foot
and so far as practicable ecouomy be
adopted.

San Francisco, Deo. 8. A small sloop
