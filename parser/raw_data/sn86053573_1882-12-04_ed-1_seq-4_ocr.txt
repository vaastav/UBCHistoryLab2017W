Commissioner Ilmima Ilcport
Tho report of Gen Bauji Commissioner
of Internal Revenue printed tills morning
contains gomo striking suggestions nnd Is
withal ono oftho most important documents
ever issued from this cxtepsivo bureau
Gen IIauh discusses tho necessity for re
ducing tho government income mid shows
how tho receipts through his oUico have in
creased from 113000000 iii 1878 to 1 10500000
in 1SS J All of this conies from distilled spir
its fermented liquors and tobacco excepting
1H700000 which Is tho amount received
from all other sources Tlio Commissioner
recommends that tho internal rcvenuo tax
from all sources excepting spirits beer and
tobacco bo repealed aud that tho special
license taxes be reduced 40 per cent Ho
then makes careful calculations and estimates
to bhow that tho amount of reduction thus
effected would along with tho repeal of tho
tariff rates on sugar secure tho requlslto re
duction of revenues Tho suggestion touch
ing tho sugar tariff necessitates somo explana
tion of how aud why in which tho matter Is
handled with clearness and ability An ex
tension of tho bonded period for whisky is
recommended and the statement mado in this
connection that a movement Is now on foot
for tho removal of tho whisky from ware
homes for exportation The distillers could
without violating tho law as It stands thtu
expoit their entire stocks keep tho whisky
abroad as long as they like and bring it back
to sell whentho market should bo ready and
with all this expense savo money to tlio trade

The Iuto Sir riaiiVragh
Under its present management Tun Na
tional BltuiiluAN will in no senso bo a
personal organ Abovo and beyond all things
elso it will bo u newspaper It will of course
havo opinions of its owuuid It expects to bo
able to find a way of expressing them through
its editorial columns iu a manner that will
leave no doubts as to Its podtlon
Tliis much wo desire to say before alluding
to an interview with Mr Wayne MacVeauh
lato Attorney General of tho United States
printed Iu the columns of a Philadelphia
newspaper Monday morning last a letter
was given tho press of the country purport
ing to havo been written by Mr MaoVumiii
to tho President giving reasons why ho could
not remain in tho Cabinet of President
Arthur Stripped of its fringe of rhctorlo
and Its tinsel embroidery tho gist of Mr
MaoViaiiuh purpoitcd letter to tho Prosl
dent was to tho effect that ho could
not remain In tho Cabinet for tho
reason as ho bellovtll ho President
would not favor a vigorous prosecution of tho
btur routo conspirators That is tho sum and
StaMo of the hwthy totter To make
answer to this but ono paragraph Is needed
Mr MaoVeaoh after being urged to remain
In his plaeo as Attornoy Gcucral and proceed
with tho prosecution that had been com
menced under his administration retired
from tho Cabinet In plain English
ho deserted his post of duty His
Illmsy renson for taking to tho woods Is
given above But what was tho result Did
tho prosecution of tho star route cases stop
Did they even flag for one day Docs not
Jlr MaoVeahh know that Attorney General
BiiEWSTEii under the direction of tho Presi
dent has gono steadily forward Has not tho
vigorous cotirso of tho present Administration
dispelled thofear If ever honestly entertained
expressed by Mr MaoVeaoh in his evac
uation letter If Mr MAoVEAcm does
not know this tho peoplo of this
country do know it Mr MaoVeAohs asso
ciates whom lio left iu chnrgo of tho cases
know It Peoplo who read havo not forgotten
that tho President in his first message used
the following languago I havo enjoined
upon tho officials who aro charged with the
conduct of tho star routo cases on tho part of
Iho goverument nnd upon tho eminent coum
S2l who before my nccession to tlio Presi
dency wcro called to their assistance tho
duty of prosecuting with tho utmost vigor of
tho law nil persons who maybe fouifd chargo
ablo with frauds upon tho postal service It
will not do for tho lato Attorney General to
como forth from tho woods at this timo and
mount tho band wagon It Is too gauzy
Ills placo is with tho advertising agents the
paste carriers and tho bill posters This is
tlio best hold of tho departed Attorney-General
Iu this issuo wo glvo our readors tho opin
ion of tho country ns expressed through its
press No better evidence is needed that the
country is satisfied with tho courso of the
Pro3ldent It may gall Mr MaoVeaoh
somo that tho country is much bettor pleased
with tho vigorous and courageous course pur
sued by President Arthur iu thismatter than
with the gong beating and Jaw bono perform
auco kept up by Mr MacVeaoh Doubtless
this is tho caso but Mr MaoVeaoh will havo
to Btand it It would bo much manlior in him
to admit that his fearB if ho over honestly cn
tci laincd them in regard to tho courso the
President would pursuo wcro without founda
tion
Tho country can depend upon it that tho
President i3 detcrmlued that so far a3 ho and
his officers aro concerned there shall bo to tho
end a vigorous prosecution of theso star routo
cases
Ono word moro word witli Mr MaoVeaoh
In Iiis interview alluded to nbovo ho pays his
respects to The National Repuulican and
tho gentleman who from this issuo on will
bo responsible for tho editorial courso of this
paper For his benefit wo will stato that Mr
IIatton did not tako Mr Bradys placo in
tho Post Oflico Department nor has ho at any
timo hndcoutrol of tho Administration or
gan nor doe3 ho propose now to go into the
organ business Not being an organ grinder
this leaves no posslblo chanco for Mr Mac
Veaoh to becomo associated with us iu
business If as tho
and somo of his newspaper friends as
sort Mr IIatton is or has been in
any way connected with tho star routo con
spiracy The Repuulican has no hesitancy
in asserting that ho should bo turned out of
his position in tlio department The iRe
lunncAN is iu favor of tlio most rigorous
prosecution of theso cases to tho end that no
guilty man shall escape That this end is
much more likely to bo reached by tho bold
courso being pursued by tlio President
than by tho bono and tambourino policy1
which seems so near and dear to tho heart of
Mr MaoVeaoh wo havo not a doubt
