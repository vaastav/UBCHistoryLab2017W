waafortho bouoiit of tho poor of tho parish,
tho lecturer selected ror his subject “ Charity
as a Virtue,” aud it proved to bo touch
ingly approprioto for tho occasion.
Tho lecture was replete with anecdotes: some
now and some old, and all gathoiiug additional
beauty as well as strength and impressiveness
from tho plain, unadorned manner in which the
lecture was delivered. It was of such a conver
sational stylo that it would hardly admit of a re
port. Tho audience present was very largo, and
tho lecture must have realized at least $1,01)0.
A popular evangelical minister on tho West

“do not mention the name of that cross-eyed
lazar to mo. Ho does not take tho 0:12 a. in.
train to business; nay, my child, sometimes ho
misses the 8 o’clock. I rarely see him coming
out on the 6:30, and when bo catches tbo 6:20 it
Is generally at Canal street, and ho has a dove
in bis mouth. On Saturday night bo never gets
in earlier than by tho 11 o'clock, and Satur
day ho went to sleep and was carried up to
Waukegan, and had to come back on tho freight.
A man of such principles does not deserve your
affections. and 1 shall toll him so Sun
day when ho comes out on tho funeral.”
ACCIDENT TO THE NEWSPAPER TRAIN.
The newspaper train which left the North
western depot early yesterday morning with tho
Sunday morning papers for Milwaukee aud tho
towns along tho road was wrecked near Bose
bill. It is understood that somehow or other
file switchwasloft open, ami,before the euglneer
became aware of it, tho tram was off the truck,
[•'ortuuately, however, no lives wore lost. There
a ore but two cars and the engine aud tender.
The engine ran fast iu the sandj, right
tcross tho track, but was not upset.
X’ho cats woro badly wrecked, but
none of tho inmates received injuries of any
consequence. A train was immediately after
tbo accident ordered from Milwaukee, the pas
sengers and paiicie transferred toll, and de
posited at Milwaukee at 10:10, when tbo papers
woro disposed of as usual.
Tho engine is obstructing tho track on the lino,
and until removed tho passengers and freight
have to bo transferred. Mr. Hobart, tho Divis
ion Superintendent, with a large force of men,
was at work at tho scone of disaster all day yes
terday, aud it is believed time this morning all
will bo again in running order.
UNDER A SIDEWALK.
A mysterious and singular case of death was
brought to light yesterday morning, after tho
body had iatu for nearly a year under a sidewalk,
whore the deceased had crawled to die. A boy
named Benjamin O’Connor, whtlo playing with
some companions, ran under tho stone walk
in front of No. 273 Erie ntreet, near LaSalle,
and was horror-struck on discovering tho ghastly
skeleton of a man in a sitting posture, with tho
back loaning against tho curb wall. Tho un
sightly frame was partially covered with soma
old and worn garnmeuts. O'Cmmor com
npinicatod tho discovery to an olllcsr, and tho
remains were taken in charge. In tho pockets
of tho clothes wore found a proscription for
hydrate of chloral, bearing date of March 6,
1374, but containing no address or name. Ou
the finger of deceased was ft seal ring,
marked “IL B.” There were also found in tho
pockets a 'smnU Smith A Wesson, five-barreled
revolver, two of the chambers of which wore
empty and contained tho cartridge shells: a
magnifying glass; a paper cigar case, marked
Adler & Co.. 183 Madison street \ a railroad
guide; a lot of foreign coins, aud two knives.
The cause , ot death has been theorized upon
by those acquainted with tho discovery of the
remains. Some think tho man shot himself,
from tho fact that tho -revolver was found on
him, but it is not likely that a person who had
fired two shots at himself would take a sitting
posture afterwards, and coolly place tho re
volver in his pocket. Others say that deceased
might have been drugged, murdered, and robbed,
ancPthou drugged to tho out-of-the-way place
whore ho was found. Ollier* still assort that
deceased must have boon an intemperate man,
and iu a fit of delirium to have taken all the
chloral at once, which had boon proscribed for
him in small Tins last would seem to be
the most probable theory of any that have beon
advanced. Tim now Coroner has a mystery on
Ida hands to begin with, aud it may bother him
to learn tho cause of death iu this particular in
stance.
CRIMINAL.
Richard Brass was arrested last evening for
tho alleged theft of a pocket-book contains $4,
from Frank McAllister, while tbo latter was
asleep. Both men are colored.
Tho polico pulled a negro bagnio on State
street, near Taylor, yesterday morning at an
early hour, while the inmutes wore engaged in &
noisy orgio. 'Twelve persons of both sexes were
arrested.
James MoOutie was caught by Detectives Tom
Blmmons and Flynn, Saturday night, white try
ing to puwu a wolf robe at tbe comer of
Randolph and Franklin streets. Ho saw tho
officers while Uo was In tho store, and chopped
tho robo and attempted to escape, showing
plainly that bo had stolon it. Tho vobo is at
Madison Stroot Station awaiting an owner.
Howard Aldon was so hard up for filthy lucro
that ho iutruatod his overcoat to L. W. - Sawyer
yesterday, with tho understanding that that
alleged mock auctioneer was to dispose of it for
the sum of (9. Sawyer failed to do as ho agreed,
so Aidon says, and did not giro him either over*
cent nor money. Hence, ho caused his arrest by
Officer Diet.
Johnny Ryan. Ed Burns, and George Miller,
noted ” crooks,” wore run Into the Armory last
night byOfilcer Mahoney, who found them in
company with a number of men of similar char
acter In the Pacific Exchange, a saloon on Clark
street, near Van-Buron. Ryan is known to tho
police ns a safe-blower and export burglar, and
so is Burns. Tho prisoners are gonteoly dressed,
ami have nothing in their appearance to indicate
their calling.
Patrick Clark, the keeper of a saloon at No. 07
West Lake stroot, was summoned to appear be
fore Justice Scully this morning to answer the
charge of altowmg miners to play pool in his
place. Tho police assort that Clark keeps a low
dive—a resort for thieving West Side l&de. who
spend their lli-gotton gains In drinking ana pool
playing. This is the case with a number of Just
sucU places, and It would prove a good move If
the police wore to make it hot for the keepers
ami Inmates of all brothels where boys under
ago are allowed to oougrogate.
Mr. F. M. Chapman appeared at the West Side
Station last night with a whip and a buffalo-robe,
tho relics of a once proud and happy team. Ho
drove to tho church corner of Monroe and Laflln
streets, and in order to circumvent the ungodly
took with nim not only whip and robe, but one
of tho reins, leaving the latter In the vesti
bule. Ho fancied that this would eeouro his
outfit from all molestation, but tho children of
men ore wiser than tho children of light, and
somebody entered the vestibule, and, heedless of
tho hymns and prayers that sounded within, took
tho rein, restored It to itaproporplnco, and drove
proudly oft. This was bad, but It is perhaps
worse to be stopped by a.dozen odd policemen
whiio fooling it to homo, and to bo compelled to
explain to each one of them that this business
of carrying around a robe and whip is striotly
legitimate.
LAKE.
MEETING Of TUB HOARD Of TRUSTEES.
The Board of Trustees of Lake mot m session
Saturday afternoon, with all present.
In response to the call of the Bjard for bids
for first-rate Joliet gravel, several wore road end
referred. John MoCaffery offorod it for $2 per
cubllo yard ; Clybomn, Werner & 00. at $2.10
per cubic yard, delivered oo the Groat Eastern
itoad, and at $1.85 delivered on the Chicago,
Bock Island A Pacific Railroad. Bills to the
total amount of $1,4116.60 wore allowed, and
ordered to be paid.
The Committee on Pinnace submitted a report
relative to certain debts and obligations of tho
town which should bo provided lor and paid.
Among the debts referred to are thoao inourrod
by the expenses for tho wator-works, firo-oUi m
telegraph, hose, hoso-bousos, and carts, hy
drants, etc. Thor reported that the Town Treas
urer was unable to give a correct statement of
the condition of tho finances of tho town till a
final settlement had been made with tho County
Treasurer, and, as tho town cannot roly upon
the collection of taxes for 1871 to moot
tho present demands, no fund having been pro
vided in tho levy of 1873, they recommended
that tbo town negotiate a loan ami issue the
bonds of the town for those purposes, tho bonds
to bo pay&blo in two years after date.
Tbo recommendations of tbo Committee woro
approved, and a resolution introduced to issue
bonds to tbo nominal amount of $35,000
in denominations of SI,OOO each, .-payable
in two years, bearing interest at the rato of 10
per cent per annum. Tho President and Clerk
woro instiuoted to sign tho bonds, and attach
the corporate seal thereto. It was further re
solved that tho President appoint a committee
for tho purpose of negotiating said bonds in
behalf of tho town. Tho mooting thou ad
journed.

Tho Now Freight Tariff of tho Balti-

Its Domoralizing Effect on tho Com

Tho Froo-Pnss System—Reduc

Charges,
BALTIMORE & OHIO FREIGHT RATES.
TURin EFFECT ON TUB SARATOGA COMBINATION.
Thor® is trouble browing among tbo railroads
belonging to tbo Saratoga combination. Instead
of seeing all the roads in tbo country united
into one grand offensive and defensive organiza
tion, there is now a prospect that within a short
time all of thorn will bo at loggerheads, and
competition will be livelier than over. All tbo
benefits, bowovor, that have boon promised to
tbo public by tbo combination will bo obtained
through tbo independence aud tbo good sonso of
a fow loading roads, such as the Grand Trunk,
Baltimore & Ohio, and Illinois Central. Had it
not boon for tho Managers of these lines, tbo
rates the coming winter would havo been mado
excessively hlgb, as this was the sole objector
tbo combination. That such was their intent Is
shown by tbo fact that on tbo let they raised tbo
rates to all points Bast 6 cents per 100 pounds.
Not thinking this raise was sufficient, they
decided at a mooting hold d fow days ago at
Indianapolis to make a further raise. Hereto*
fore the charge on fourth-elans and grain baa
always boon tbo same. But tbo Commissioners
in their wisdom decided that fourtb*olass could
stand more than grain, aud therefore decided
to make, after tbo 14th of this month, tbo
v&to on fourth-class freights 6 cento higher
?or hundred, which would bo 60 aonts to Now
ork, aud 46 cents to Baltimore. Wood they
took this notion they labored under tbo delusion
that thoßaltimore & Ohio would lay noobstacloe
jn their way, hut conform in tbo main with their
ideas. Bat never were they mere sadly mistaken
than when they calculated thus. While they
wore considering tho best way of squeezing as
much as possible out of tho public, the Managers
of the Baltimore «k Ohio, with an oyo to bene
fiting Baltimore as well as Chicago at the ex
pense of New York, decided that it would servo
their interests much bettor by adhering to the
cheap rates iu voguo during the Rummer months,

This notico fell upon tho combination like a
thunderbolt. They were (daggered, aud could
hardly believe that such a tiling was possible,—
that a road should, of its own accord, carry
freights as low iu tho winter as it would in tho
summer. All their calculations have come to
naught by tho action of tho Baltimore A Ohio,
and it Is now intimated by the Managers of sev
eral of the roadt; belonging to tho combination
that they will not abide by the action talma by
the Commissioners, but act independently, anil
make the rates as inw as those established by
tho Bfltimoro A Ohio. Mr. J. P. Joy, the
President of tbo Michigan Central Railroad,
hold a conference with Mr. King, tho Vice-Presi
dent of tho Baltimore A Ohio, at tho Palmer
House, Saturday, with a view of offVctmg a
compromise. It is learned, however, that tho
effort has boon fuUlo, Mr. King refusing to
make aiw concessions.
THE TICKET COMMISSION STATES!,
which hid been abolished by die combination ns
woli as tuo Western Mauagois, is also rapidly
coming in vogue again, it being undeistood
that mofii of tho roads are again paying com
missions, aud several scalpers in town are
known to have tickets from loading roads for

TUB FREE-PASS REFORM
is also doomed to go the way of all other railroad
reforms. 'The resolutions recently passed by tho
Western Bailroad Managers are inoperative, as
it was Btieoialiy agreed that they should not go
into effect unless adopted by ail other roods not
present at tho meeting. And, as the Illinois
Central refuses to sign tbs agreement, It falls
nocesfranly to tho ground. Tho Mauagors of the
Illinois Central refuse to sign the agreement
because in every instance when any of choir
rivals violated the agreement it was claimed
that they had done it first. They are sick, they
claim, of those criminations and recriminations.
By not signing any agreements they can
not violate thorn. This road, like the Balti
more it Ohio, will hereafter act independently
ou all questions, and cry to manage Its own af
fairs to tbo bout of its ability. The roads be
longing to the combination feel very sore about
this, aud the Managers of two of tho leading
Eastern linos informed a Tribune reporter yes
terday that they would, after this, givo passes to
whomsoever they saw fit. Tho Illinois Centra)
has ttluo entered upon a warfare against one of
the worst monopolies iu oxistouce, and for
which it wilt receive the universal thanks of tho
public. It is a well-known fact (hat
TUB SLEEPING-CARS
on moat or the roads oi'o owned by tbs Pullman
Palaoo-Car Company. Tho exorbitant charges
on those cars have often boon tho theme of dis
cussion, but no reduction was effected. Tho
Illinois Central, which owns its own sleeping
cars, has now put forth Its edict, and
announced that hereafter tho charges ou their
lino at least shall bo greatly reduced. Hereto
fore $2 has been tho charge for a single berth to
St. Louis, but tho Illinois Central hereafter
charges but $1.50 for a double berth. Tho Chi
cago A Alton, which is a rival to tho Illinois Cen
tral, and runs Pullman cars, is, of course, great
ly affected by this action, and tho Managers de
clare that Mr. Pullman shall come dowu to the
same figure as their rival lino. Negotiations are
now iu, progress by which a general reduction
iu sleeping-car rates will shortly bo made.
From the above it can easily no seen that the
combination which was born mntd so much her
aldry aud fiouvi»U is doomed to die an igaomln
ous death before long.

lects to pub lu ' tho scales, together
with alt tho costa of prosecution, in
cluding attorney's foes. One suit is
aimed at Cortland Station. It happens that tbo
total shipments at that station for the past year
amount to much loss than 60,000 bushels, hence
tho prosecution will fall. The facts in the case
are that two or throe shippers, resident at Syca
more—a lively town Bor i miles north of Cort
land, and which is connected with tho Northwes
tern Railway by a little local railway—wanted
this latter Company to put in scales at Bvoamoro,
whore tho shipments largely exceed 60,0011 bush
els. Tho Sycamore Company declined to incur
tho expense, claiming that tho Northwestern
Company got the greatest benefit from those
shipments, and ought therefore to put la tho
scales at Cortland. Tho matter was laid before
tho Board of Supervisors. Counsel was ob
tained, and, as a result, three suits wore Insti
tuted. —nt Cortland, DoKnlb, and Malta. The
statute was approved April 26, 1871. and those
are the first suits brought under Its provisions.

SUITS AGAINST TUB LAKE SHORE RAILROAD COM-
PANY FOR UNPAID TAXES.
Watkinoion {D*e. 4) th*p ttth tu th« .Yet* York
A rumor was current m Washington this after*
noon to tho offcot, that the Commissioner of In*
tornal Revenue was preparing to begin suits
against tho Lake Shore & -Michigan Railroad
Company for fcIOh.OOO, unpaid taxes upon tho
surplus earnings of that road. Inquiry at tho
office of tho Commisslonor of Internal Revenue
confirms tho report to a certain extent. The Spe
cial Agents of tho Department have boon for some
time engaged in investigating the condition of
several roads in the West, and have found an ap
parent difference of from slso,Odd to $160,000 in
the tuxes duo tho Government on the surplus
earnings of the Lake Shore & Michigan South
ern. So far as the agents have prosecuted their
inquiry, it does not appear whether tins differ
ence is simply one of bookkeeping, which may be
explained without attributing any fraud to tho
management of tho road, or whether the
taxes have actually been withheld. In
regard to further proceedings against the same
road for another and larger sum, the Bureau de
clines to give anydelinito information at present,
but theca seems to bo good reason for supposing
that the rumor that such proceedings ore con
templated is not entirely without foundation.
The Treasury Agents have also been overlooking
the management of four other railroads iu tho
West, and hovodlscoverodan apparent deficiency
of taxes amounting in tho aggregate to $150,000
distributed among tho four. Their investiga
tions are still incomplete.

Thomas, and tho Rev. Dr. Powers, and excellent
progress was made by distributing contribution
boxes with which tho llttlo folks are to solicit

An examination of tho Public Library account
with tho Comptroller shows that tbo available
credit balance bos dwindled down to such a
f>oint as to cause grave apprehensions ooucom
ng tho future of tho Library. Owing to this
lack tho Board of Directors, Saturday, rescinded
tho power to purchase books heretofore con
ferred upon tho Librarian and tho Committee

WASHINGTON.
Tho President's message will bo sent to both
Houses of Congress to-day at 1 o'clock p. m.
In tho gossip of the day is the throat that
some Senators will oppose the continuation of
Gov. Jewell as Postmaster-General. The cause
of thle personal hostility Is the fearlessness and
Independence which bare characterized the ad*
ministration of Oct. Jewell. Ho baa found it
necessary, in some of the numerous changes
which bo has made in the Post-Office service, to
remove the favorites of several Senators from
office, and to seriously Interfere with some im
portant political projects; but there Is no prob
ability of any serious attempt to defeat his con
llrmatiou.
The Washington hotels srs crowded with Con
gressmen, and the city begins to assume the ap
pearance of session-time. The result of the
elections constitutes the main topic of discussion,
and almost every Congressman has bis own
views of the causes of tho Republican defeat.
The members are scarcely more united In tboir
forecasts of tho probabilities of the session.
Borne claim that the closing months of tho Forty
third Congress will bo very busy ones, and that
much unwise legislation will be attempted. They
argue that the House, by a large num
ber of outgoing members, will bo one of
tho grab-and-run sort. The remarkable
number of tho noted characters in tho lobby
gives coloring to these suggestions. Many of
the prominent leadots of the lobby are already
on band, which is something remarkable so
early in the winter, and is observed aomo of
the noted women who were widely known in
Johnson's time a« successful lobbyists, and who
have not boon seen in Washington for somo
years, have already taken up their winter quar
ters at tho Capital. But tho Congressmen whoso
opinions aro best worth knowing insist that the
session will be remarkable for its prndonco and
its wisdom. Speaker Blaine himself says ho
believes that the session will be a quiet and un
eventful ouo.
LOUISIANA.
The Louisiana politicians in Washington give
out that the present programme with regard to
Finchback is to influence the Senate to seat him
first, and to investigate him afterwards, if de
sirable. Tbe point to bo gained by seating him
is, that tbe Senate cannot seat him without rec
ognizing the validity of tbe Kellogg Govern
ment, and, as tbe House has already recognized
tbe Kellogg Government by seating throe Bo
publicans, Congress would have fully recognized
tho Kellogg Government, and tho expected
revolution of McEnory would bo defeated.
Tho Kellogg people have no special love lor
Piechback, but would bo glad to make use of
him as tho moans whereby tho complete recog
nition of tho Kellogg Government can bo se
cured.
FORF.iatf.
The Russian Government has sent notes to
various Powers iuvmng (bom to participate in
tbe Conference to bo bold in St. Petersburg to
resume discussion of tbe Questions submitted
to tbe Conference lately bold at Brussels.
There was an exciting debate la (ho German
Reichstag Saturday, upon the estimates of the
Foreign Office. Bismarck, in tbe course of de
bate, said Germany recognized the Pope as tbe
bead of the Catholic Church, but required no le
gation at tbe Vatican. If negotiations with tbe
Pope were necessary, they could bo conducted
through tbe Ambassador to Italy. So long as
the Pone urges the Catholic clergy to broait the
Jaws of ibo States in which they Jived, diplomat
ic relations between himself and Germany were
useless.
The National Assembly engaged in an exciting
debate Friday and Saturday on a bill supported
by tbe clerical Deputies for freeing the Univer
sity from the control of tbe Slato. Tbo principal
speakers were Bishop Dupaoloup, Legitimist,
and Cbalemoa La Coat, Radical Deputy for
Benches du Rhone. Bishop Dupanlop, in the
course of his remarks, passionately declared
that danger to society was to bo apprehended
from the friends of those who favored tbe shoot
ing of tbo Archbishop of Paris. This remark
occasioned a groat tumnlt in the Chamber. Upon
the restoration of order Chalomon La Cour re
torted upon Bishop Dup&nloup m a speech of
groat blttorooßS. Ho said ho loft snob personal
ities to the judgment of honest men, aud those
who had some regard left for the dignity of the
French Episcopate. Upon tbe conclusion of tbo
discussion, the bill passed its second reading by
a vote of 553 against 133.
