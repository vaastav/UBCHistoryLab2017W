TBIATT IS SIGNED.
The Peace Commissioners at Paris
Finish Their Work.
The Final Scene a Memorable One
Main Features of the Historical
DocumentSpanish Government
Approves the Protest.
Paris, Dec. 12.The treaty of peace
was signed at 8:45 Saturday evening.
The treaty as signed consists of 17 ar
ticles, it having been found advisable
to subdivide two or three of the articles
in the draft agreed upon at the last
meeting. The commissioners of the
two nations wrote their signatures on
two copies of the treaty, one copy be
ing for the archives. The document
was prepared by Secretary Moore, 11 1
behalf of the United States commis
sioners, and by Senor Villa Kutia for
Spain, on account of the continued ill
ness of Secretary Ojeda, of the Spanish
commission. Each copy contains the
English and Spanish texts of the treaty
in parallel columns. The wording had
been approved previously by the com
missions without a joint meeting, so
there was no controversy on this sub
ject.
Principal Features.
The essential features of the peace
treaty are as follows:
FirstThe customary preface of treaties
In the nature of an expression of amity and
of hope for perpetual peace.
SecondThe relinquishment by Spain of
her sovereignty over Cuba.
ThirdThe withdrawal of all Spanish
troops.
FourthRelinquishment by Spam of
sovereignty over Porto Rico
FifthSpain's cession of the Philippines
SixthThe withdrawal of the Spanish
troops there
SeventhPayment by the United States
of $20,000,000 for the Philippines.
EighthThe provision for the "open
Coor" commercial policy in the Philippines.
NinthCable station rights in other Span
ish colonies.
TenthRelease of Cuban and Philippine
political prisoners
EleventhMutual abandoning of all
claims for indemnity.
Memorable Scene.
The signing of the treaty would'have
afforded a subject for a great historical
painting. The group gathered about
the table in the stately chamber of the
foreign office was impressive in itself,
while the sense of the momentous is
sues which the act decided was deeply
felt by all the participants, giving an
impressive and solemn tone to the
scene. Around the great mahogany
table sat the ten arbiters of the des
tinies of an old and a young nation.
Standing behind them were numerous
attaches of the American commission.
To the Americans it was a happy end
ing of the epilogue of war *for th'e
Spaniards it was plainly a bitter trag
edy, none the less painful because long
foreseen. They sat silently, as though
almost crushed, and none could with
hold sympathy from Senor Montero
Rios, the president of the Spanish com
mission, who, coming from his bed,
was bundled in a great overcoat,
though logs, were burning in the fire
place near by.
Close of the Labors.
Although the commissioners met at
half-past three o'clock, expecting to
finish their work in half an hour, the
engrossing of the treaty on parchment
was found to be so troublesome that it
delayed the signing of the document
until 8:45. Clerk Martin, of the Amer
ican commission, worked all day with
out even stopping to eat. When he
came into the chamber at 7:30 with the
document he found the commissioners
waiting. The Spanish copy had arrived
a half hour earlier. Arthur Ferguson
then proceeded to read first the English
and after that the Spanish version of
the treaty. This finished, two copies
were passed around the table, the com
missioners signing them in the order
of their rank, as follows: William K.
Day, Senator Cushman K. Davis, Sen
ator William P. Frye, Whitelaw Reid
and Senator George Gray, Senor Mon
tero Eios, Senor Abarzuza, Senor Gar
nica, Senor Villaurutia and Gen. Cerero
Saenz, each commission signing its
opponent's treaty. Both were tied
with the Spanish and American colors.
When the seals were prepared to be
affixed attendants were sent scurry
ing for ribbons of the French tri
color, with which the documents were
sealed as a compliment to the French
hosts of the commissions. Many of
ficials interestedly watched every detail
of the proceedings.
Spaniards Criticise Americans.
The last seal being impressed, the
commissioners rose and without for
mality each member shook the hands
of all his intagonists and exchanged
assurances of sincere personal esteem.
The Spaniards afterwards commented
acridly upon what they termed the
bad taste of the Americans in muster
ing a crowd of attaches to gloat over
the consummation of their downfall
and to scramble for relics.
The signing was finished at 8:45. At
that time the door of the chamber
opened and Senor Villaurutia appeared
and exclaimed to a group of corre
spondents who were waiting in the cor
ridor: "C'est fini!" The other mem
bers of the Spanish commission fol
lowed Senor Villaurutia and passed si
lently through the vestibule to their
waiting carriage^ The:Americancom
mission strolled out,'* chatting -com
placently, and as they descended the
Steps the lights in the chamber were
[darkened. *ftIIM
There has been a great contest
among the faiftlies and friends of the
American commissioners for posses
sion of the evns with which the sig
natures to the 'treaty were written.
Some of the Americans were provided
with handsome~pens purchased for the
purpose. The Spaniards appeared to
be unaffected by the souvenir craze and
contented themselves with the ordi
nary quill pens strewn on the table
President Sends Congratulations.
Washington, Dec. 12.The official
news of the signing of the peace treaty
was received in Washington a little
later than the press reports. It was in.
cipher form, as usual, from Judge Day.
It was at once transmitted to the pres
ident, who was alone at the time, but
within a comparatively short time al*.
the members of the cabinet had either
called or sent their congratulations.
The president's congratulations were
promptly cabled to the commission.
The news of the signing had been so
thoroughly discounted that the actual
receipt of the official advices created
little stir here. There was a general
feeling of relief, however, that no un
foreseen circumstance intervened at
the last moment to block the peaceful
close of the negotiations.
Expenses of the Commission.
The following figures give the esti
mated expenses incurred by the Amer
ican members of the peace commission,
now spending their seventy-first day in
Paris, up to this time:
Salaries of commissioners, $30,000 salary
of secretary, 510,000 compensation of inter
preters, legal advisers, etc $20,000, steam
ship passage for party, $5,000, hotel accom
modations, $10,000, personal expenses of
party, incidentals, etc $15,000, services of
special employes, $10,000 Total, $100,000.
The American peace commission is
composed of five members, a secretary.
a score or more translators, type
writers, stenographers and a retinue of
servants. In all, 32 persons were in the
party.
Protest Approved.
Madrid, Dec. 12.The government
entirely approves the memorandum of
protest against the action of the United
States commissioners filed by Senor
Montero Eios at Paris.
The memorandum protests against
the refusal of the Americans to surren
der the securities deposited in th*
treasuries of Cuba and Porto Rico by
private Spaniards, remarking that
"never has a civilized nation commit
ted such an act of violence."
Secondly, it protests against the ulti
matum demanding the Philippines.
Thirdly, it protests against the posi
tion in which those Spaniards are
placed who desire to remain in Cuba.
Fourthly, it protests against the ref
erence to the destruction of the Maine
in President McKinley's message to the
United States congress. On this point
the memorandum says:
"Spain has proposed arbitration but t,he
United States refuses" to give her the right
which is granted to a criminal, namely, the
right of defending herself: The Spanish
commissioners leave the care offixingthe
responsibility for the explosion to the en
tire world, which will say whether those
are responsible who desire the truth or
those refusing to seek it"

A RICH HARVEST.
Oat and Corn Crops Bring: to Farmers
of the United States $fe3,000,000
More Than in 1S!7
Washington, Dec. 12.On the basis
of the farm prices on December 1, the
agricultural department figures place
the 1S98 crop of corn and oats as worth
$83,000,000 more than the crops of 1897.
Statistician Hyde accredits this largely
to the difference in prices. The corn
crop is a trifle larger than in 1897, and
the average price per bushel is 2.4 cents
higher, while the oat crop is similarly
a little larger than in 1897, and the
prices were 4.4 cents higher.
