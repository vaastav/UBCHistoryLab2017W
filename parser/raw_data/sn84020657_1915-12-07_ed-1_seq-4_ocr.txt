BROOKS' ROOSEVELT INTERVIEW
Sydney Brooks, the New York correspondent of t
London Mall, has telegraphed his newspaper an iut
view with Col. Roosevelt In which the latter Is quot
as saying that he began preparing to raise 12.000 rouf
riders tho moment he heard of the Lusltanla dlsasti
Brooks said that the former President Is greatly ct
grlned because the United States has not at this tit
an army In Flanders fighting with the Allies again
Germany and severely censured the President for h
efforts to maintain the neutrality and peace of tl
United States. The Interview also carries a messa,
to the Allies urging the three principal powers. En
land, France and Russia to keep up their courage ai
fight.
Brooks says that CoL Roosevelt said that he ft
that ho would be ashamed to visit Europe again b
cause of the failure of the United States to partlclpa
In the war. He also quotes the Colonel as saying th
he would not offer his services to the Allies, as he fe
that he could do them more good by remaining in tt
United States and opposing the course of the presei
administration.
However, almost as significant as the statemcn
he attributes to the would-be-roughrlder-agaln are Sy<
ney Brooks' own statement on the Interview. While ai
mlttlng that Roosevelt still has a large following an
is Influential In the United States, the London Journa
1st says that his position Is not that of the America
people, but that the latter are devoted to the Wllso
policies. He says he Is satisfied that If the Amrelca
people were to choose today between Roosevelt an
Wilson the latter would get nine votes out of every te
cast.
Another of Brooks' declarations is also very slgnlf
cant. Referring to Col. Roosevelt's statement that h
would liked to hare commanded 22,000 American rougt
Riders In a campaign In Flanders. Brooks adds:
"The Generals. Colonels. Majors and
some of the Captains for the new Rough
Riders were actually selected, and Col.
Roosevelt calculated that within three
months after the declaration of war he
and bis men would be in Flanders. To
forego that dream has been one of the
bitterest disappointments of his life."
A 2.50O-MILE BATTLE LINE
Since the entrance of Bulgaria Into the war th<
battle-front Is fast taking form as a gigantic loop hum
from Riga and Nieuport across all Europe.
The Belgian-French line runs unbroken from th?
Channel to the Swiss border. Beginning again neai
the Ortler. the Italians carry it mainly on mountair
tops and passes to the Adriatic. Naval patrols keei
guard in Antivari, whence Montenegrins. Serbs. French
and .English in succession swing it north about Monte
negro, then south through Serbia to Strumitza. 11
landings are made at Kavala and Enos. this line will be
practically continuous to Gallipoll: at sea it is contin
uous now.
British submarines have interrupted tratfic iu the
Hellespont, and Russian ships guard the Black Sea
From Rumania north to Riga runs the Russian line
much shortened since Warsaw fell but still more than
$00 miles in length. The land lines of trench and mine
and daily conflict and concealed artillery'* with their
windings, will alone extend more than 2,o00 miles if
the gap north of Kavala Is presently filled, as expected.
Every conflict in this mighty distance is for rail
road lines; in France, for the network serving Lille
and Sedan or threatening Verdun; in the Austrian moun
tains for the key-points. Toblach, Villacb. Goritz; in
Serbia, for the Belgrade-Constantinople line; In Russia,
chiefly for that connecting Riga and Dunaburg. The
advantage of interior lines is with the Kaiser. Within
a few days he can probably send a through train from
Ostend to Constantinople. He can send one now from
Windau to the Iron Gates of the Danube.
For the Allies, the loop cuts the central powers
off from every sea except in respect to submarines, and
from every great food source of the world.
IN KEEPING WITH HISTORY
The failure of the British Bagdad expedition is
thoroughly in keeping with traditions of the English
army. Long established usage has established it as an
English custom to begin a campaign unprepared. Eng
lishmen have always acted, apparently, on the theory
that one Englishman can whip half a dozen of another
race, and. as a result English history is cluttered with
pages giving accounts of Braddock's massacres, Sara
toga and Yorktown surrenders. New Orleans disasters.
Balaklava charges, Zululand slaughters. Kartoum mur
ders. Tugela and Splonkopje blunders, and hundreds of
like tragedies. It seems that England will never learn
from past follies. It is a shame that men who fight so
recklessly and die so bravely should be treated as Eng
lish soldiers have been so frequently treated by blunder
ing Cabinets. It would seem that Great Britain is In
capable of awakening to the seriousness of a war sit
uation until many of her bravest and best men have won
heroic graves, and the public treasury has been spilled.
TOO COMPLIMENTARY
The Ketchikan Progressive-Miner pays the Demo
crat a compliment that is not wholly due when it gives
them credit for most of the fighting for a full Territorial
form of government for Alaska. Of course all real
Democrats are always supporters of self-government,
and they are for full Territorial form of government
which includes county government because that means
local control of local affairs. However, the Republicans
are also entitled to credit for supporting a full Terri
torial form of government for Aaska. Only the out
and-out Wlckersham men opposed the full Territorial
form of government memorials in the last Legislature.
The memorials were introduced by Senator Millard and
Representative Shoup. respectively, and that of Senator
Millard is the one that is in the session laws. Both of
these Legislators were Republicans.
Senator Clarke, of Arkansas, who was one of the
seven Democratic Senators who prevented the passage
of the administration ship purchase bill at the last ses
sion of Congress, has changed his mind and will sup
port the measure this year. In the meantime it has
been discovered that the United States has lost 570.
000,000 on account of the failure of the bill a year ago.
ETho shipping interests on which the administration ha
an option for $30,000,000 are now held at $100,000,00*
? Not a very comforting thought for those Democratic ii
NT surgenta of that year, but another illustration of ho1
the acts of those who have opposed the Wilson pol
? cies have come back to plague them. However, the at
ministration gained powerful support when the Pres
'??? dent Pro-Tem of the last and the new Senate was adde*
"22 to its backers.
.00
12, If the Administration should need more support ii
of the Senate it might prevail upon Nutmeg State Demo
crats to suggest Taft for Senator. Tho former Presl
dent has been one of tho most persistent endorser!
of Administration policies in tho country. His lotos
declaration is In support of the President's very modcr
er. ate preparedness plans. He says the army and navj
cd should be stronger but ho is opposed to having thi
i country "rush Into militarism."
sr.
Self-government Is the remedy for practically all ol
Qt, Alaska's governmental Ills. The government of Alaska
18. should be transferred to the people of Alaska. That It
lls why Alaska should have a "full Territorial form of gov
l,e ernment."
ge
K. The term "full Territorial form of government" also
1(1 has Republican authority for Its uso as well as Demo
cratic. It was used by Gov. Clark and President Taft
,jt before It was sanctioned by President Wilson In his
ie. message to Congress two years ago.
to
nt It is fair to suspect that Speaker Clarke's belief that
,lt The Colonel will be the Republican Presidential nominee
,0 Is another case of the wish being father of the thought?

HANDICAPPING PUBLIC UTILITIES
(Petersburg Report.)
a "If an Alaskan community desired
to establish or purchase water works
j. or other public utility, it would be
helpless because the organic act pro
vides that the Legislature caunot au
'? thorize the creation of public debt of
any kind." . . .?(Dally Empire.)
Yes; and where the organic act leaves off the mut
ter of public utilities the Alaska Civil Code steps In
and puts on the finishing touches.
While the organic act prohibits municipalities from
borrowing money with which to provide public utili
ties, the Civil Code, through the medium of a system
of "license fees." makes It impossible in many Instances,
for an individual, a company or corporation to furnish
these utilities. For example, the license fee of $300
per annum practically bars private enterprise from fur
nishing electric light in other than large towns. Alas
' ka has, and always will have, many small communities
t J and camps where the business to be obtained would not
* i justify an enterprise of this character in paying such
a tax.
In this list of license fees are other items of equally
5 unjust taxation, effecting utilities and industries which
r are necessary to the health and comfort of the people
, and to the development of the Territory.
May be with a "full Territorial form of government"
these evils would be remedied?
1 But if they are to be adjusted it will have to be
- done by a Legislature with different ideas than those
> possessed by the members of the two Legislative ses
, sions already held in the Territory, whose efforts were
confined largely to picking out Industries upon which
' more tax might be levied rather than to seek relief
for those already overtaxed.
Perhaps a session ol the Territorial Legislature
which would show more of a disposition to encourage
private undertakings -even if limited to resolutions and
? memorials?would give to th? p<><.pi>- ??><i ??ougrcss more
confidence in the propositions for "full Territorial" or
state government.
WHAT THE SOUTH THOUGHT OF BOOKER
WASHINGTON
(New York World)
Among the many tributes to the memory of Booker
T. Washington from men prominent in public life, by
all odds the most acceptable, as it is also in the circum
stances of the most significant, is the official statement
of the Governor of Alabama;
In the death of Booker T. Washington the
colored race has lost its greatest leader. He
was a man of unusual force and executive abil
ity. and In many respects rose above the en
vironment of race. In my opinion, his efforts
toward the development of his people have been
of great benefit to them and to the entire
South. Bom a slave, living a life of earnest
endeavor, and at his death the chief executive
of an Institution of Nation-wide reputation cre
ated by his own brain and energy, demon
strates to the world the unbounded possibili
ties open to those whose purpose is to accom
plish something, and marks him as one of the
able men of his time.
To have deserved this eulogy from the Governor
of a former slave State affords striking proof of the
greatness of the work accomplished by the negro edu
cator. Most Northern people aro Inclined to think that
the attitude of Vardamans and the Cole Bleases toward
Booker T. Washington and his efforts to uplift his race
Is the typical and characteristic Southern attitude.
What the South really thought of the former slave
who affected so much for the social and mental eman
cipation of his race Is more truly expressed in the gen
erous and whole-hearted tribute of the Governor of Ala
bama.
Cardinal Gibbons thinks "we should adopt a safe,
sensible and sane position" as to defense and adds,
"I am favorable to middle-of-the-road-cautlon." That Is
where the majority of the American people are?in the
middle of the road, with the pcace-at-any-prlce folks
sitting on the fence and militarists kicking up the dust
ahead.?(New York World.)
The fact that President Wilson's program for Na
tional defense has the unqualified opposition of Colonel
Roosevelt proves that It Is sane and rational and prac
tical.?(New York World.)
Everybody has money In Brooks. That is a good
sign. It has not come out of the ground there yet in
any great quantities, but it will come out next sum
mer.?(Fairbanks News-Miner.)
Curiously enough, none of the patriots who want to
double the United States army are besieging Congress
to double the Income tax or the corporation tax.?(New
York World.)
Being a Democrat and coming from Ohio, Minister
Brand Whitlock inevitably is mentioned for the Vice
Presidency.?(Springfield Republican.)
Elihu Root declined to seek election to the Senate
because of his age. and now he can't run for President
because of his bad constitution.?(Philadelphia North
American.)
The cause of the ladies has boon so far advanced
that success is promised for the next time, and a truly
good thing about the suffrage advocates is that they
never give up.?(Philadelphia Press.)
Suffrage leaders raise $100,000 for 1916. You can't
down a good cause.?(Chicago Herald.)
Wisconsin- picks a dairyman as its most disting
uished citizen. The most prominent man in Illinois is
probably a woman.?(Chicago Herald.)
Brother*?Perhaps
"Yes." said the principal of the
young ladles' seminary to the proud
parent, "you ought to be very happy,
my dear sir to be the father of so
large a family, all the members of
which appear to be so devoted to one
another."
"Largo family! Devoted!" gasped
the old gentleman in amazement.
"What on earth do you mean, ma'am."
"Why yes, indeed," said the princi
pal, beaming through her glasses, "So
fewer than eleven of Edith's brothers
bave been here this term to take her
out, and she tells me that she ex
pects the tall one with the blue eyes
again tomorrow."?(Chicago Herald.)
"Brown Is a mighty dull fellow, isn't
he?" remarked Smith.
"Yes," replied Jones, "But he man
ages to bore everybody he meets."?
