In the coil ise of his an-i'ial nddr-Ks
yesterday state Master G. VV. Pierce
said:
"One year ago at this time ihe
treasurer's report showed $i5,CM.75 o
our credit, showing a good h althy in

able to reK.rt $7.91)2. US to our credit,
showing a gain of $1.29S.fS3.

held during the past year lu ditlerenl
parts of the state, under the direction
of the State Orange, and in connection
w ith Pomona Grangt s. All have n.cn
successful from every point of view.
Several other field day meeting? have
been held under the direction ot
Pomona Granges, and it is the opinion
of your stHte master that more field

year, as they are uplifting in both a
social and educational way; let u-i
have more field day meotli.gi-.
"Several Grange' fairs have been in
augurated In the state during the bst

they should lo encouraged, as ihe
are both educational and entertaining.

"It was my pleasure to attend a
Grange fair last fall where three
thousand persons were present. This
fair was located in one of the moun
tain towns of Vermont, and has- ""en
In operation for two years, nnd ! am
sure it hart been successful from i mm .v
point of view. It was a genuine "oiie
try agricultural fair; n good exhlbl-lle-i
of live stock nnd agricultural ex
hi.its were shown, nnd athletic
spoils of nn entertaining nature were
presented, and the fair served a two
fold purpose first In bringing the
people together In social enjoyment of
a high moral character, and nb-o It
became educational by tin exhibition
of the agricultural products of the
farm. Let us have more Grange agri
cultural fairs of the kind metitlonel.

Plans to Settle All Difficulties With
France and Holland and Later
With United States
Santander, Spain, Dec. 10. The
French steamer Guadeloupe, with
President Castro of Venezuela, came
in here yesterday.
It was learned soon after the ship's
arrival that President Castro will con
tinue on board the steamer to Bord
eaux and that from Bordeaux he will
travel overland to Berlin.
The mystery of the President's trip
to Europe was dispelled very soon af
ter the Guadeloupe dropped anchor.
The reports that Castro Is critically
ill and that he was deserting Venez
uela forever were pronounced ab
surd, and It was declared that he
came to Kurope with the double pur
pose of being examined by European
specialists and of settling Venezuela's
outstanding differences with foreign
powers, especially Fiance and Hol
land. The doctors who accompanied him
said the President's general condition
was eei lieiit. and that h" had d -riv
i! - . a, benefit from the voyage.
The Pi'i sident p;'id no heed lo the
warning of the Venezuelan Consuls
who talked with him on board the
Guadeloupe that he miuht in.- lie per

that the fact that he is going to
Fiance with his hand stretched out in
peace h is pn c d.d him.
Before he h ft Venezuela he made
the first advance by authorizing the
return of several Frenchmen who had
been exiled for political reasons, and
during the voyaye over he had a num

Kissiny Contract is Brought '
Into Court
STANDARD OIL OWNED HIM
Held Bulk of Stock in Hit Company
Through Prairie Oil and das
Company.
New York, Dec. 10. Frank II. Kel
logg, the Govennent's lawyer, who Is
prosecuting the suit to dissolve the
Standard Oil Company of New Jersey,
has at last got possession of the con
tract which explains the loan made by
the Standard to C. X. Barnsdall of
Pittsburg. Sovxeral days ago, while
John D. Archbold was on the witness
.stand, testifying in his own defense,
Mr. Kellogg demanded this contract.
Mr. Archbold ordered that a messen
ger bo sent to Pittsburg to get the
document. It was In the possession
of the Pittsburg Trust Company.
The contract Indicates beyond ques
tion the Standard's control of the Held
In which Barnsdall operated. Al
though the original loan of $7,.i)0,0n0
to Barnsdall was made by the Stund
; rd Oil Company itself, the hist con
tract, dated In February. i:u7, and
covering a period of seven years, is
made by President Young of the
1'ia'rie Oil and Gas Company, which
is owi"d by the Standard of New
Jersey.
The securities which Mr. Batnsdall
gave for the great loan that enabled
him to build up the business of the
Barnsd; II Oil Company tire the same
securities which, a year ago, William
G. Rockefeller, on the w It iuss stand,
th signaled as in his opinion, compara
tively worthless. They consist of the
bulk of the stock in the Ban.sdalo
Oil Company itself, as well as stocks,
bond", and mortgages covering valu
able coal lands, and a right to operate
an Oklahoma oil field coveting an
ore;i of $:;r,i urn) acr-s.
It Is understood that the contracts
provided that the repavtinnt should
be made from the dividends of tho
Barnsdall Company by February. Bil l,
ut which time presumably, ami in the
event of another loan not being made
on the same security meanwhile tin'
securities would revert to Mr. Barns
dall. Prior to that time, however, the
Standard Oil Company would be In ah
s..lute control of the Barnsdall Com
pany, even though Mr. Barnsd iM was
considered an Independent, through
the possession of the bulk of I lie com
pany's stock.

$60,000 WOULD SCON GO
Calls Castellane's Attempt to Smirch
Reputation of His Children's
Mother Abominable.
Paris, Dec. 10. At the continuation
today of the suit brought by the
Count de Castellane against his for
mer wife, now the Princess de Sagan,
formerly MIsa Anna Gould of New
York, for the custody of their three'
children, M. Rousset, counsel for
George Gould, who Is a party defen
dant as trustee of the Gould estate,
characterized as abominable and scan
dalous the Count de Castellane's at
tempt to besmirch the reputation of
the mother of his children merely to
vent his hatred.
The only way, he said, in which the
Princess could have avoided this suit
was by submitting to extortion and
threats, but this she would not do be
cause she had nothing with which to
reproach herself and nothing to fear.
"The. methods employed by M. de
Castellane assuredly will be branded
as they deserve by French Justice,"
said the speaker. The former Coun
tess had bom kind to her husband, so
kind that ine Gould family had
deemed it advisable to establish a
trusteeship of tin- property to put an
etui lo the extraordinary extrava
gances of the Count.
M. Rousset said tho Count rei'ognlz
ed himself as Incapable of bringing up
his children and that he therefore de
sired that they be placed In the cus
tody of his mother.
"The Count, however," he said,
"would take Into his own hands the
yearly income of tr.O.OOO belonging to
the children. This money would melt
of War as ridiculous ami severe, Sena
never would receive a cent of it."
The Princess d" Sagan enjoyed the
esteem and affection of her family,
who were convinced that the children
should remain with their mother. It
was true, M Rousset continued, that
George Gould was somewhat appre
hensive when he learned his sister
wished to marry Prince II. lie de Sa
gan, because he realized that Sagan
was related to th" Castellane family,
which hl.H sister hail juM suet ibd
In leaving. He gave his consent, how
ever, wlo n lie saw that his sister's
heart was set upon the marriage. The
lawyer said h" was convinced that the
Sagan household would be a happy
one. but If a scandal broke out Mr.
Gould would be the first to ask that
the children be removed.
M. Rousset concluded his plea by
beseeching the court not to separate
the three children from their tender
nnd loving mother.

FOR VOLUNTEER ARMY
President Advocates Such a Measure
Introduced In Senate.
Washington, IVe. 10. An emer
gency volunteer army mensure Is
advocated by President Roosevelt In
n special message sent to Congress,
mid the draft of the bill nccompnnyliig
the message has already been Intro
duced In the Senate by Mr. Cullom.
The President says the bill Is Inten
ded to replace the present law. which
was placed on the statute books
"piecemeal ii ml hurriedly partly on
the eic of the war with Spain and
partly after hostilities had actually
commenced."
After declaring the prcs nt law to
be faulty and wholly lnadeipiat to n
spe. dy nnd proper organization of a
volunteer force, the President says
the bill proposed which was drawn
under supervision of the chief of staff
of the army, has the hearty approval
of the war department. The ines.itigt;
says further:
"It Is designed to afford the com
plete machinery by which, should wn
be confronted with n foreign war the
executive power could proceed at
once to trntiBfortn enthusiastic and
patriotic citizens Into efficient nml or
ganized soldiers."
It Is pointed out by the President
that the proposed measure would not
call for a dollar's expenditure during
Ihe year of peace. The proposed
bill Is clastic. Under Its provisions a
force of S.ODO.noo men could bo raised
as well as one of 60,000.
