whose behalf it is nominally undertaken.
This is a most healthy truth, which It is
wise for nil our people to learn. Any
movement based on that class hatred which
at times assumes the name of "class eon
si biasness" Is certain ultimately to full, and
If it temporarily si.eeeeds. to do far-reach
tug damage. "i'hi'S consciousness." when'

whether In at employer’s i elation or In
a wbrklngn issoclat Hie movi
incut In nue-dlon was one In which the ap
peal was made to all workingmen to vote
primarily, not as American citizens, hut as
individuals of a certain "lass In society.
Such an appeal In tho lirst place revolts
the more high-minded and farsighted
among the persons to whom it 1,, ad
dressed, and in the second place tends to
arouse a sir i. ; antagonism among all oth
er classes of citizens, whom it therefore
lends to uni'" against the vry organization
on whose behalf it is issued. The result Is
therefore unfortunate from every stand
point. This healthy truth, by Hie way,
will I-- the Socialists If they
ever succeed in establishing in this country
an Important national party based on such
class consciousness and -elfish class Inter
est.
The wag* workers, the workingmen, the
laboring men of the country by the way In
whleh they repudiated the effort to get
them to cast tlndr votes in response to an
appeal to class hatred, have emphasized
their sound patriotism and Americanism.

't he chief layy makers In our country may
be, and often are, tile judges, le cause they
are the Until seat of authority livery time
they Interpret contrai t. properly, vested
ghts, due proct ss of law, lilt* rty. they
oi" i warily enact Into law parts of a sys
tem of social philosophy; and as such In
terpretation Is fiindan. nial, Huy give di
rection to all law making. The decisions
of the omits on eeoi-uuie and social ques
tions depend upon their economic and so
cial philosophy; and for the peaceful prog
ress of onr people during the T'yventieth
t'entiiiy we shall oyve most to those judges
~ ho hold to n 1 nt leth (U ntut j • <
and social philosophy and not to a long
outgrown philosophy, which was lt"e!f ~.e
product of primitive economic conditions.
Of i-nurse a judge’s views on progn sslve
social philosophy are entirely second In
linportaiice to ids possession of a high
and line character; which mans the pos
session of such elementary virtues ns lion
i sty, courage, and f.ilrnilndedin-ss. The
judge who owes his election to pandering
to demagogic sentiments or class hatreds
and prejudices, and the judge yvho owes
cither his election or his appointment to
the money or the favor of a great corpora
tion, are alike unworthy to sit on the
Vein'll, are alike traitors to the people; and
no profundity of legal learning, or cor
rectness of abstract conviction on ques
tions of public policy, can serve ns c.n off
ie! to such shortcomings Hut It Is also
true that judges, like executives and legis
tutors, should hold sound views on the
questions of public policy which are of
vital Interest to Hie people.
The legislators n ml executives are
chosen to represent the people In
enacting and administering the Inyvs.
The judges are not chosen to rep
resent tin- people In this sense. Their
function Is to Interpret the laws. The leg
-1 Inters an- responsible for the laws; the
judges for th" spirit In w hich they interpret
and enforce the laws, tie stand aloof from
the reckless agitators who would make the
judges mere pliant tools of popular prej
udi'-e and passion; and we stand aloof
from those equally unwise partisans of re
a* lion and privilege who deny the proposi
tion that, Inasmuch as judges are chosen to
serve the Interests of the whole people, they
should strive to lind out what those inter
* ire, and, so tar ns they conscientiously
can, should strive to give effect to popular
'■"iivletlon when deliberately and duly ex
pressed by the lawmaking body. The courts
are to he highly commended and staunchly
upheld when they set their faces against
wrongdoing or tyranny by a majority; hut
they are to be blamed when they fall to
recognise under a guvi rnnieut like ours the
deliberate Judgment of the majority ns to a
matter of legitimate policy, when duly ex
pressed by the legislature. Such lawfully
expressed' and deliberate Judgment should
hi given effect by the courts, save lu the
extreme and exceptional cases where there
has been a clear violation of a constitutional
provision. Anything like frivolity or wan
lomiess In iq -"Hlng stn-li clearly taken gov
ernmental action Is a grave offense against
Hie republic. To protest against tyranny,
to protect minorities from oppression, to
nullify an act committed In a spasm of
popular fury, Is to render a service to the
republic, lint for the courts to arrogate to
themselves functions which properly belong
to the legislative bodies Is nil wrong, and lu
the end works mischief. The people should
not be permitted to pardon evil and slipshod
legislation on Hie theory that the court will
set It right; they should he taught that the
right way to get rid of a had law Is to
have the Legislature repeal It. and not to
have the courts by Ingenious hair-splitting

older men now alive the social relations
have changed far more rapidly than in Hi"

associations, and the extreme strain arm

The huge wealth that has been accumu

some of these Individuals made possible

Postal Savings Banks.
I again renew my recommendation for
postal savings hanks, for depositing snv
bigs with the security of the (lovernment
behind them. The object is to encourage
thrift and economy lu the wage earner and
person of moderate means. In fourteen
states the deposits in savings hanks as re
ported to tin 1 comptroller of the currency
amount to $3,500,245,402, or 05.4 per cent
~f the entire deposits, while In the remain
big 52 stales there are only $70,509,543. or
l.ti per cent, showing conclusively that
there are many localities In Hie United
States where sufficient oportunlty Is not
given to the people to deposit their savings
Th result Is that money Is kept In hiding
and unemployed. It is believed that In the
aggregate vast sums of money would he
brought Into circulation through the Instru
mentality of the postal savings bank. While
there are only 1.455, savings banks report
big to Hie comptroller there are more than
61,000 postolllces, 40.000 of which are
money order offices. Postal savings hanks
are now In operation In practically all Hie
great civilized countries with the exception
of the United Stales.
Parcel Post.
In my lust annua! message 1 commended
the postmaster general’s recommendation
for an extension nf the parcel post on the
rural routes. The establishment of a loeul
parcel post on rural routes would be to the
mutual benefit of the farmer mid the coun
try storekeeper, and it Is desirable that the
mules, serving mote Hum 15.0dd.000 people,
should he utilized in the fullest practicable
extent. An amendment was proposed In
the Senate at the Inst session, al the sug
gestion of the postmaster general, provid
ing that, for the purpose of ascertaining
the practicability of establishing a special
local parcel post system on the rural routes
throughout the l ulled Slates, th" postmas
ter general he authorized and directed to
experiment and report to Hie Congress the
resblt of such experiment by establishing
a special local parcel post system on rural
delivery routes in nut to exci'-'d four coun
ties In the l ulled Slates for packages of
fourth class matter originating oi. a rural
route or at the distributing po tofllce for
.'"livery by rural curriers, it would seen]
, 111 iy proper that such an experiment should
he tried In or#er to demons)rats the prac
ticability of the proposition, especially as
the postmaster general estimates that the
revenue derived from the operation .if sii"L
a system mi all tie- rural route* vould
amount to many million dollars.
Hawaii.
I call particular mention to the Territory
of Hawaii. The Importance of Iho e Mauds
Is apparent, and the need of Improving
their cundlnon and developing I heir re
sources 13 urgent. In rereitt years Indus
trial conditions upon the Islands have radi
cally changed. The Importation of coolie
Uetir has practically ceased, and there 1s
now developing such n diversity In agricul
tural product's as to mak- possible a ehan"s
In the lantl conditions of the ,errltory, o
that an opportunity may be given to the
small laud owner similar to that on the
mainland. To aid these changes, the na
tional government must provide the neces
sary harbor Improvements on each island,
so that the agricultural products can be
carried to the markets of the world. The
coastwise shipping needs of the islands,
and the alien contracts 1a..0r law should
be so modified In its application to Hawaii
as to enable American aud European labor
to be brought thither.
Wo have begun to Improve Pearl Harbor
for a naval base and to provide the neces
sary military fortltlcations for the protec
tion of the islands, but I enn not too
strongly emphasize the need of appropria
tions for these purposes of such an amount
as will within the shortest possible limo
make those islands practically impregnable.
It is useless to develop the industrial con
dll lons of the Islands and establish there
bases of supply for our naval and mer
chant Heels unless we Insure, as far ns
human Ingenuity can, their safety from
foreign seizure.
due thing to be remembered with all our
fortifications Is that it Is almost useless
to make them impregnable from the sea if
they are left open to land attack. This
is true even of our own coast, but it la
doubly true of our insular possessions. In
Hawaii, for instance, it Is worse than use
less to establish a naval station unless we
establish It behind fortlHeatbms so strong
that no landing force ean tale them save
bv regular and long-continued siege opera
tions.
The Philippines.
Ttcal progress toward self government Is
being made in the Philippine Islands. The
gathering of a Philippine legislative body
and Philippine assembly marks a process
absolutely new In Asia, not only as regards
Asiatic colonies of European powers but ns
regards Asiatic possessions of oilier Asiatic
powers -and, Indeed, always excepting the
striking and wonderful example afforded by
the great Empire of Japan, It opens an
entirely new- departure when compared with
anything which has happened among
Asiatic powers which are their own mas
ters. Hitherto this Philippine legislature
has acted with moderation and self
restraint, and has seemed In practical
fashion to realize the eternal truth that
there must always be government, and that
the only way In which any body of indi
viduals can escape the necessity of being
governeil by outsiders Is to show that they
are able lo restrain themselves, to keen
down wrongdoing and disorder. The Fili
pino people, tnrough their officials, are
therefore making real steps In the direction
of self-government. 1 hope and believe that
these steps mark the beginning of a course
which win continue till the Filipinos be
come Hi to decide for themselves whether
they desire to he an independent nation.
Ilui It Is well for them (and well also for
tlm - Americans who during tne past decade
have done so much damage to the Filipinos
hy agitation for an immediate Independence
for which they were totally unlit) to re
member that self-government and 'pends, and
.. • lc| ml, upon thi i liplno th< ■ ■
All we ran do is to give them the oppor
tunity lo develop tin- capacity for self
government. If we had followed the ad
vice of the foolish doctrinaires who wished
us nt any time during the last ten years
to turn the Filipino people adrift, wo
should have shirked the plainest possible
duty and nave Inti lot •<1 a lasting wrong
upon the Uilplno people. We have acted
In exaetlv the opposite spirit. We have
given the Filipinos constitutional govern
ment: a government based upon justice;
and w , i' i: have governed
I hem for their fcood and not for our ag
grandizement At the pr< - nt time, ns dur
ing the past tin years, the Inexorable logic
..f facts shows that this gov. tnim-nt must
he supplied by us and not by them. We
must be wise and generous: we mu-l help
the Klilplnos to no Her ihe difficult art of
self i-outml, which is simply another name
for self government. But we can not give
them self government save In tin sense of
governing them so that gradually they may,
If they are able, barn to govern themselves.
Ind r ihe present -v t■ in of tnd
sympathetic administration, vv. have every
reason to believe that they are gradually
acquiring the character which lies at the
basis of self-government, anil for which. If
it be lacking, no system of laws, no paper
constitution, will In any vvi-- serve a- a
aibstilute. our people in tic Philippines
have achieved what may legitimately be
! ii giving to
them a government which marks on the
part of those in authority both the neces
sary understanding of the people ami the
necessary purpose to serve them disinter
estedly and In good faith. I trust that
within a generation the time will arrive
when the liilllppln can d.-i b!" for tkern
elves whether It Is well for them to he
. i,me independent, or to eiaulnm under the
tion of a strong and
power, able to guarantee to tie Islands
order at home and protection from foreign
: i 11111 no) om the
exact dale when It will be vvi to consider
ini .ii'Uil.-nco as a. -nxo(l and n ib bulb- policy.
It would be wo re (nan r,.TTy ro fry to set
down such a date In advam- 1 . for it must
depend upon (ho way In which the lin.ip
pine people themselves develop the power
of self-mastery.
Porto Rico.
I again recommend that American citi
zenship be conferred upon the people of
Uorto llico.
Cuba.
In Cuba our occupancy will cense In
about two months' time; the Un'-aus have
In orderly manner elected Iheir own g. vern
mental .authorities, ami the island w II be
turned over to them. Our occupation on
ibis occasion has lasted n little over two
years, and Cuba has thriven ami prospered
umbr It. Our earnest hope and otc desire
is that the people of I lie island shall now
govern themselves with justice, so that
peace and order may be scure. Me will
gladly help them to lids end : but 1 would
solemnly warn tln-m to remember the great
truth that the only way a people can por
! mnnenllv avoid being governed from with
out is to show that tiny hoth can and Will
Ijovorn themsclvos from within.
National Guard.
Now that tho organized militia, the Na
Hoiinl Guard, lias been Incorporated with
i!;i- army as a part ot the national i i l l l es, it
ves the g rv< rnmenl to and > eve j Ii
sounble thins In its power to pcrleet Us
efficiency. it should lie assisted In its In
struction and otherwise aided more libera.ly
than heretofore. The continuous services
of mattv well trained regular oflb-ers will ho
essential In this connection. Such officers
must ho specially trained at serving schools
best to qualify them ns Instructors of the
National Guard. But the detailing of ffi
cers for training at the service schools and
for duty with the National Guard entails
detaching them from their regiments which
are already greatly depleted by detachment
of officers for assignment to duties pro
scribed bv acts of tbe Congress.
A bill is now pending before the Congress
creating a number of extra officers In tbe
army, which If passed as It ought to be,
will enable more officers to be trained as
instructors of National Guard and assigned
to that duty. In case of war It will lie or
tbe utmost importance to have a large mira
her of trained officers to use for turning
raw levies Into good troops.
Thero should he legislation to provide a
complete plan for organizing the great body
of volunteers behind the regular army and
national guard when war lias come. Con
gressional’ assistance should be given those
who are endeavoring to promote ride prac
tice so that our men, In the services or out
of them, may know how to use tlie rule.
While teams representing the 1 nited States
won the rifle and revolver championships or
tbe world against all comers In England
lids year. It is unfortunately true that tbe
great body of our citizens shoot less anil
less as time goes on. To meet lids we
should encourage rifle practice among
schoolboys, and indeed among all classes, as
well as In the military services, by every
means In onr power. Thus, nnd not other
wise. may wo be able to assist in preserving
the peace of the world. lit to hold our
own against the strong nations of the
earth, our voice for pence will carry to ttie
ends of the earth. Unprepared, and there
fore unfit, we must sit dumb and helpless to
defend ourselves, protect others, nr preserve
peace. Thu first step In the direction of
preparation to avert war If possible, and to
bo fit for war If It should come—ls to
teach our men to shout.
Census.
I strongly urge that the request of the
director of the census In connection with
the decennial work so soon to lie begun,
be compiled with and that the appoint
meats to the census force be placed under
the civil service law, waiving I lie geo
graphical requirements as requested by the
director of the census. The supervisors
ami enumerators should not be appointed
under (he civil service law', for the reasons
given by the director. I commend to the
Congress the careful consideration of the
admirable report of the director of the

thereon taken.
