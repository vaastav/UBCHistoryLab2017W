THE DENISON REVIEW
Congress in Session.
The 57th Congress convened Mon
day at Washington, the republicans
having large majorities in both
branches. The Senate was called to
order by Senator Prye of Maine, the
president pro tempore, and after a
formal session adjourned fortherepub
lican senators to go into caucus. The
caucus appointed committees on com
inittee assignments and order of busi
ness, Senator Allison, as the permanent
chairman of the caucus, being the
dominating factor in both committees.
The house organized by reelecting
Speaker Henderson and the other of
fleers of the last congress, all of whom
had been unanimously renominated in
the republican caucus Saturday. The
rules of the last congress were adopted,
after Col. Hepburn and the democratic
leader had gone on record as favoring
amendments curtailing the power of
the speaker. About 3,000 bills were
introduced, and the members 'engaged
in their biennial lottery for seats.
Congress on Tuesday appointed com
mittees to arrange for fitting tributes
to the memory of President McKinley,
and received the first annual message
of President Roosevelt. The message
is a state paper of very exceptional in
terest and merit for in addition to the
authoritativeness properly belonging
to a document of its class it is written
in a clear, comprehensive and con
densed style that would be impossible
for one lacking the discipline that
comes from much writing. Pres'dent
Roosevelt is very much more of a liter
ary man than has been anvone else
who has ever occupied his present
office, and the difference shows con
spicuously in his message. It is meat
all the way through, contains, no dry
summary of departmental reports, and
in spite of its length it should be read
from one of the great papers that have
had the .space tc publish it all.

WORKER8 PLAN MANY REFORMS.
President Gompers Denounces Em
ployment of Children and Urges
Greater Organization Among Wom
en—Secretary Morrison's Report.
Scranton, Pa., Dec. 6.- -Two hundred
and eighty-five delegates, represent
ing more than 1,500,000 workmen, re
sponded to the roll call a,t the open
ing session ol' the annual convention
the American Federation of Labor,
which was called to order by Presi
dent Samuel Gompers in St. Thomas'
College yesterday. The convention is
said to be the largest congress of
workmen ever held in this couiitry.
Organization, settlement of questions
involving contested seats and the
reading of the annual reports of the
president, secretary and treasurer
took up the entire time of the conven
tion. During the course of the day
there was one surprise sprung on the
delegates, and one important decision
was also made. The surprise came
in the form of an objection to the
seating of the United Mine Workers'
delegates because of an alleged ar
rearage in their per capita tax. The
objection was overruled by an almost
unanimous vote of the delegates. The
important question decided related to
the contested seat of the delegate
from the Central Labor union of Rich
mond, Va., which body refused to ad
mit negro workmen to its organiza
tion. The dispute was adjusted by
seating the Central Labor union repre
sentative and instructing the execu
tive board of the American Federation
of Labor to form a separate central
union for colored men.
Mr. Gompers' report showed a net
increase of 311 local unions for the
year and a gain of 364,410 members.
The report denounces the employ
ment of young children and contends
for greater organization among wom
en workers. Mr. Gompers says he
has arranged an active campaign for
the re-enactment of the Chinese ex
clusion act.
Treasurer Lennon's report showed
an income of $186,622, expenses $118,
708 total funds on hand, $8,814.
Secretary Morrison's report shows
the total number of strikes of all
kinds aggregated 1,056, in which 153,
503 members were benefited and 12,
707 were not benefited. Their total
cost was $548,003.
WHAT STOCKMEN WANT.
Senator Warren Outlines Plenty of
Business for Congress.
Chicago, Dec. 6.—When President
Springer had called the convention of
the National Live Stock association
to order he said the program for the
day was of exceptional interest to
cattlemen. The program called for
paipers from Dr. J. H. Senner of New
York, Professor Andrew Soule of the
Tennessee agricultural college, Hon.
F. E. Warren of Wyoming, A. F.
Doremus, state engineer of Utah, and
Colonel G. W. Simpson of Texas.
Senator Warren's address was pre
sented by the secretary and ordered
printed in the record. Senator War
ren was not present.
The secretary then read the ad
dress, which contained the following
noteworthy recommendations: De
feat of the Grout oleomargarine bill,
opening up of the public domain, en
actment of pure food laws and retalia
tion against European countries.
Ambassadors and other representa
tives of foreign nations enjoyed the
hospitality of General Manager Skin
ner at the stock show yesterday.
Much interest centered about the pens
containing carload lots of fat cattle.
Armour & Co. bought the first steer
at 25 cents a pound. In the horse de
partment the Belgians were in the
ring. These splendid animals, de
clared by their breeders to be the
original type from which all other
breeds are descended, captured the
best prizes at the late Paris show.
The exhibit here includes 50.animals.
Counterfeiter in the Toils.
Kansas City, Dec. 6.— Jacob Brill
of Louisville was arrested here yes
terday charged with counterfeiting.
He was trying to pass counterfeit $5
gold pieoes and silver dollars when
arrested. At his room a complete
outfit of counterfeiter's tools were
found. According to Brill's own story
he was recently released from the
Kentucky penitentiary, where he
served six years for counterfeiting.
The police here say that his work is
unusually finished and that he is an
expert counterfeiter.
Jury'* Verdict Not Guilty.
Harrison, Neb., Dec. 6.—As was an
tlclpated yesterday when the confes
Bion of young Force in his trial for
the murder of Harry Russell was ruled
out the state failed completely to es
tablish a case, and Judge Harrington
Instructed the jury to render a verdict
«f not guilty and the prisoner is free.

McComas Proposes Death Pen
alty for Attack on President.
SENATOR HOAR HAS PLAN TOO.,
Would Select Some Desolate Spot to
Which All Anarchists Should Be De
ported—Measures Proposed in Up
per House—Day's VWork in Senate,
Washington, Dec. 6.—Senator Mc
Comas (Md.) made an extended and
careiully prepared speech in the sen
ate yesterday with anarchy for his
theme, and was lollowed by some
ijriet remarks by Hoar (Mass.) on
the difficulties in the way of dealing
•with anarcmst ass&ssins. McComas'
remarks showed caretul examination
of the legal authorities. He main
tained that congress had full power
under the constitution to enact a law
punishing with death any person kill
ing a president or assaulting the
president with intent to kill, or aid
ing, inciting or procuring such an act.
He favored rigid provisions in the im
migration laws for the deportation of
alien anarchists. Much of the speech
was devoted to an explanation of the
dangerous doctrines of anarchy and
the extent to which these doctrines
had been propagated within recent
years. Senator Hoar's remarks were
interesting, as coming from the ven
erable chairman of the judiciary com
mittee, which will have much .to do
with the framing of any-legislation on
this subject. He said the difficulty
was that assassins of kings and rulers
always gloried in their crimes and
were in nowise deterred by the fear of
punishment. For this reason he
thought it was almost useless to mul
tiply punishments. The most effect
ive remedy, he suggested, would be to
have the civilized nations of the
world agree upon some desolate spot
on the earth's surface, to which all
anarchists who upheld assassination
or the overthrow of government should
be deported. In such a community
the anarchist could carry out his the
ories of living without a government
and the world would be rid of his
presence.
The senate passed a bill extending
the life of the industrial commission
until Feb. 15 next, to complete the
work it now has in hand. The com
mittee which will consider an appro
priate tribute to the late President
McKinley was announced.
The senate adjourned until next
Monday.
OPPOSE SENATE'S ACTION.
Is an Invasion of the Prerogative of
tne Lower Body.
Washington, Dec. 6.—Members of
the house of representatives are show
ing some opposition to the origination
of Philippine revenue legislation in
the senaite, and in particular to Sena
tor Lodge's bill, which deals with this
subject. Representative, Tawney
(Minn.)holds that the constitutional
provision that "all bills for raising
revenue shall originate in the house of
representatives" applies to Philip
pine measures, and the Minnesota
member will oppose any senate bill
on the subject as an invasion of the
prerogatives of the house.
Overstreet (Ind.) and quite a num
ber of other influential members main
tain
rthat
the senate Philippine bill
involves no invasion of house rights,
as it extends an existing law to the
Philippines, and is not a revenue
measure within the meaning of the
constitution. In any event the ques
tion of the right of the house over
the subject is likely to be discussed
on the floor of the house.
Deadwood Jeweler Shot.
Deadwood, S. D., Dec. 6.—Sol Levi
son, a prominent jeweler and pawn
broker of this city, will probably die
from the effects of a bullet through
the left breast, fired by Leo Winsberg.
Winsberg was taken into custody im
mediately after the shooting. He
stated to the police that he hoped he
had killed his man. He said he had
been brought out to the Hills on mis
representation of the business by
Levison.
Refuse to Intervene in South Africa
The Hague, Dec. 6.—The attempt
of the socialists in the chamber to
induce the foreign office to intervene
in South Africa failed again yester
day, Foreign Minister Van Lyndon in
forming the interpellators that the goy
ernment could not interfere with the
concentration camps except to relieve
its own subjects and could not take
the initiative in amy appeal to the
powers.
London, Dec. 6.—The city enter
tained the prince and princess of
Wales yesterday at ai luncheon given
in the Guild hall and presented them
-with an address of congratulation on
their successful tour of the. British
empire.
T~
Davenport, la., Dec. 6.—E. S. Jenks,
a contractor, pleaded guilty to the
charge of forging a relative's name
at Mt. Pleasant and was yesterday
sentenced to the penitentiary a* Fort
Madison for five yeare.
