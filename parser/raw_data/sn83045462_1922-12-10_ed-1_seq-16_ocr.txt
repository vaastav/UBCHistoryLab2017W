CONSTRUCTION IN SPRING
Mrs. Charles Goldsmith Praised for
Part in Successful
Campaign.
The goal of $150,000 for the erection
of a Hebrew home and hospital I
for the aged has been reached and j
passed, Mrs. Charles Goldsmith, |
chairman of the executive committee,'
announced last night. The total
amount received in cash and pledges
is $157,000.
"But the activity of the committee
will not cease herewith," Mrs. Goldsmith
emphasized. "There is such a"
large field to cover and so many who
have not been reached that we muyt
' ""tinno Aim work until all have been
approached. We were a bit modest I |
in setting: the groal of $150,000, as we
did not think a much larger amount,
which we actually should have, could
be reached. The need of the home
and hospital is evident by the liberality
of the givers."
Many More Pledges.
Mra. Goldsmith said there were
many promised pledges which she
and her assistants have not been
able to "go out and get." but which
she hopes to secure shortly. "Work
at headquarters. 217 Commerce and
Savings Bank building, lias been
heavy, as every pledge and contribution
had to be entered on a ledger,
placed on a card and tiled.
Actual construction of the home
and hospital on the four-and-a-half
acres between 10th and 13th streets,
fronting on Spring road, will begin
in the spring if a sufficient number
of pledges are paid up at that time
to insure no break in operations.
The ground has been secured with a
deposit of $23,000, and the committee
is in a position to pay the remaining
amount necessary to secure complete
titlo to the property.

Praise for Mrs. Goldsmith's work E
was forthcoming from many quarters I
last night. It was emphasized by one B
prominent person that under her I
management and work the $150,000
was obtained in a little more than a
month. "She, however, did not contine
her time to seeking out contributors,
but took complete charge
of the heavy clerical work as well,"
it was said. Another claimed that the
success of the drive was "another
good boost for the ability of women
to master large and difficult public
tasks."

WOULD HAVE FARMER
PUT ON RESERVE BOARD
State Agriculture Commissioners
iteiuse to act Agamsx j
W. P. G. Harding.
Efforts to have the National Asso- j
elation of State Agricultural Com- :
missioners go on record against the j
reappointment of W. P. (1. Harding]
as governor of the Kederal Reserve ,
Board failed yesterday at the closing
session of the fifth annual meeting J
of the organization. j
A minority resolution of protest on
the subject was presented from the j
committee on resolutions, but it was
withdrawn after a brief but sharp
debate. The principal argument advanced
against the adoption was that
the commissioners should keep ?^ear
of personalities.
The subject of Mr. Harding's reappointment
was first brought before
the commissioners by Senator h
Hefltn of Alabama, who has been I
waging a long light against the i I
former governor. : g
rne association aiu go on recora 111 i
favor of the appointment of a "real,}
actual" farmer to the reserve board, j
In approving the resolution it struck i
out the generally used term "dirt" I
farmer on the ground that it was un- '
dignified. }
The immigration restriction law \
was approved in another resoluttion,
but an amendment was urged provid- j
ing that only immigrants announcing
an intention to become American
citizens be admitted.
Legislation for widened farm credits
somewhat along the line of that
recommended by President Harding
in his annual message to Congress
was urged in still another resolus
tion. which set forth that, if necessary.
the farmers' credit should run
for two or three years.
George W. Kolner of Richmond, agricultural
commissioner of Virginia,
was elected president of the assooiotlnn
with M .T. Hnlmhprir nf St.
Paul, agricultural commissioner of
Minnesota, vice president. Dr. A. W.
Gilbert of Boston was re-elected sec
retary and treasurer.
