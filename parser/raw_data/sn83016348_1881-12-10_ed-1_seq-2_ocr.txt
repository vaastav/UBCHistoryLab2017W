KLKTOX, DECEMBER 10, 1881.
Tue President has set Congress an ex
cellent example of business-like states
manship. Eet that body go and do like
wise.
Gciteau dosn’t want to be hung: but
hopes the jury will be. Should such be
the case, wo do not envy the one juror
who couldn't agree with the eleven other
contrary fellows.
Secuetauy Folgor’s recommendation
for the repeal of the stamp taxes on bank
checks, matches and proprietary medi
cines will be heartily concurred in by
the public. Xo doubt the Secretary de
signs to include, also, toilet articles and
playing cards, so as to wipe out the whole
stamp system, except that part of it
•used for collecting the taxes on spirits,
beer and tobacco. The decrease in the
revenue effected by such legislation would
be about seven millions a year.
The Baltimore Gazette has been sold
’>a syndicate, composed of members of
the Merchants’ and Manufactures’ Asso
ciation, of which Ex-Mayor Latrobe and
% . A. Gary, our late Republican caudi
'■ for Governor, are said to be the
principal parties interested. Mr. Wm.
l!. Ilazelton, managing editor of the
- j.'Ji ertenn, is to have charge of it. Mr.
Ilazelton wields a ready pen, and will
put new life into that journal, which
will, after January Ist, be called the
Times.

explain the attitude of the Third party I
1:1 that body, of which he is sole and j
weighty representative. lie said he I
i’ll maintain the position of indepeu- !
deuce which he had occupied for the past !
ten j ears. The administration of Presi-•
dent Arthur he should treat candidly, |
. Paining it when right and opposing it
when wrong. As to the committees and
of the Senate he stood just where
he did last Spring, and should vote to
keep the committee organizations in the
'Ms of flic Republicans and the ofiices
possession of the present Democratic
c uni bants. Having thus dispensed a
pri tty even measure of both satisfaction |
■ 1 disappointment to both sides of the
Chamber. Judge Davis closed with a few
patriotic remarks and resumed the gavel.
The practical bearing of his explanation
- to show the Republicans that it is of

THE PRESIDENT’S MESSAGE.
c surrender, this week, our usual
etl;’ rial space to the President's Mes
• • ,c. because wc believe it will be possi
y more generally read than any recent
late paper. It is an admirable docu
ment, comprehending scores of import
ant statements, suggestions, and recom

PRESIDENT’S MESSAGE.
THE FIRST ANNUAL MESSAGE OF
PRESIDENT ARTHUR
To t/u Member* of the Sc mitt
(•/id House of Representative*:
An appalling calamity has befallen the
American people since their chosen Rep
resentatives last met in the halls where ;
you are now assembled.
Wc else recall, with unaltered
content, the rare prosperity with which,
throughout the year, the nation has been
blessed. Its harvests have been plente
ous, its various industries have thriven,
the health of its people has been pre
served, it has maintained with foreign j
governments the undisturbed relations of
amity and peace. For these manifesta- l
dons of 11 is favor we owe to Him who i
holds our destiny in 11 is hands I lie tri
bute of our grateful devotion.
To that mysterious exercise of His
will, which has taken from us the loved
ami illustrious citizen who was but lately
the head of the Nation, we bow iu sor
row and submission. The memory of
his character, of his noble achievements
and of his patriotic life, will be treasured
forever as a sacred possession of the whole
people.
The announcement of his death drew
from foreign governments and peoples
tributes of sympathy and sorrow which
history will record as signal tokens o(
the kinship of nations and the federation
of mankind.

OUR RELATIONS WITH GREAT BRITAIN.
The feeling of good-will between our i
own Government and iliat of Great Bri- j
tain was never more marked than at
present. In recognition of this pleasing |
fact I directed on the occasion of the late !
Centennial Celebration at Yorktown that
a salute be given the British flag. Save
for the correspondence, to which I shall
refer hereafter in relation to the proposed i
canal across the Isthmus ot Panama, lit- !
tie has occurred worthy of mention in .
the diplomatic relations of the countries. 1
Early in the year the Fortune Bay claims i
were satisfactorily settled by the British j
Government paying in full the sum of 1
£15.000, most of which lias been already
distributed. As the terms of the settle- i
ment included compensation for injuries j
suffered by our fishermen at Aspy Bay, ■
there has been retained from the gross ;
award a sum which is deemed adequate (
for those claims.
The participation of Americans iu the
exhibitions at Melbourne ami Sydney will I
be approvingly mentioned in the reports j
of the two exhibitions soon to be pro- ,
sented to Congress. They will disclose |
the readiness of our countrymen to make !
successful competition in distant, fields of
enterprise. The surrender of Sitting Bull
and his forces upon the Canada frontier
has allayed apprehension,although bodies
of British Indians still cross the border
in quest of sustenance. Upon this sub
ject a correspondence has been opened,
which promises an adequate understand
ing. Our troops have orders to avoid, |
meanwhile, all collisions with alien In- i
dians.
THE INTER-OCEANIC CANAL.
The questions growing out of the pro- i
posed inter-oceanic water way across the j
Isthmus of Panama are of grave national :
importance. This Government has not j
been unmindful of the solemn obligations i
imposed upon it by its compact of 1849
with Colombia as the independent and j
sovereign mistress of the territory crossed !
by the canal, and has sought to render
them effective by fresh engagements with
the Colombian Republic looking to their
practical execution. The negotiations to
this end. after they had reached what
appeared to be a mutually satisfactory
solution here were met in Colombia by a
disavowal of the powers which its envoy
had assumed ami by a proposal for re
newed negotiation on a modified basis.
' Meanwhile this Government learned
j that Colombia had proposed to the Euro- ,
I pean Powers to join in a guarantee of
| the neutrality of the proposed Panama
I Canal, a guarantee which would be in
| direct contravention of our obligation as
; the sole guaranty of the integrity of Co
i lombian territory and of the neutrality
j of the canal itself.
Foreseeing the probable reliance of the !
I British Government on the provisions of:
j the Clayton-Bulwer Treaty of 1850 as j
affording room for a share in the guaran
tees which the United States covenanted
with Colombia four years before, i have
not hesitated to supplement the action of
my predecessor by proposing to Her
Majesty’s Government the modification i
of that instrument, and the abrogation j
of such clauses thereof as do not com
port with the obligations of the United |
States toward Columbia or with tho vital
needs of the two friendly parties to the !
j compact.
SOUTH AMERICA AND OTHER NATIONS.
Special envoys have been sent to Chili.
Bolivia and Peru, in order, if possible, to
1 bring about friendly relations between j
j these governments.
| An honorable adjustment of affairs be
i tweet: Venzuela and France, through the j
1 interposition of the United States, is j
speedily looked for.
The recent treaties with China are ini
full force, and the relations between the
two governments very friendly.
The intimacy between this country and !
Japan, the most advanced of the Eastern
nations, continues to be cordial. The
Emperor contemplates the establishment >
of full constitutional government, and
he lias already sujnuioued a parliament
ary congress for the purpose of effecting :
the change.

THE NATIONAL FINANCES.
The report of the Secretary of the j
Treasury presents in detail a highly i
satisfactory exhibit of the state of the i
finances, and the condition of the vari- :
ous branches of the public service admin
istered by that department.

interest and other notes. $ is. 330, and to
the increase of cash in the Treasury, sl4,- j
037.023; ts&jd, $100,009,404.98. the re- 1
quirements ot iLc sinking fund for the i
year amounted to 780.904.02. which
sum included a balance of 8J7,128.78, I
not provided for during the previous fis
cal year. The sum of $74,480,201.05 was j
t applied to this fund, which left a deficit ;
j of $10,307).55JU.47- The increase of the ,
; revenues for J.*Bs over those of the pre
-1 vions yea r was $29.352.1/9f . J 0.
It is estimated that the rouidpts dur-
I ing tho present fiscal year wili i£;udi ,
; $409,000,000, and the expenditures $270,-
j 000.000, leaving a surplus of $130,000,000 j
1 applicable to the sinking fund and the
j ffeifomption of the public debt. 1 ap
-1 proven t*ie recommendation of the Sec
| rotary of tu% Treasury, that provision be
j made for the eat %y yeti re ment of silver
1 certificates, and that z, n t requiring
i their issue be repealed. They wjjre is
sued in pursuance of the policy of iie
Government to maintain silver at or near
! the gold cfondard. and were accordingly
made icceryabtu for all customs, taxes,
| and public dues. About sixty-six mill
ions of them are now outstanding. They
form an unnecessary addition to Hu:
per currency, a suflicicnt amount of which •
may be readily supplied by the national j
banks.
THE COIN AGE OF SILVER DOLLARS.
In accordance with tlie act of Februa- j
*ry 28, 1878, the Treasury Department
lias monthly caused at least two millions
I iu value of silver builliou to be coined
! into standard silver dollars.
One hundred ami two million of these
dollars have been already coined: while
only about thirty-four millions are in
circulation.
For the reason which he specifies, 1
concur in the Secretary's recommenda
tion that the provision for coinage of a i
fixed amount each month be repealed.
! and that hereafter only so much be coin
ed as shall be necessary to supply the 1
demand. The Secretary advises that the
j issue of gold certificates should not for
the present be resumed, ami suggests
that the national banks may properly be
forbidden by law to retire their currency
except upon reasonable notice of their
intention .so to do. Such legislation
! would seem to be justified by the recent
• action of certain banks on the occasion
! referred to in the Secretary's report.
REFUNDING THE BONDED DEBT.
In tho iast annual report of the Score- j
tary of the Treasury the attention of j
j Uongrcss was called to the fact that 1
j $409.(551.050 in five per centum bonds j
and $203,573,750 in six per cent bonds
would become redeemable during the
year, and Uongress was asked io an- |
thorize the refunding of these bonds
at a low'd* rate of interest. The bill for |
such refunding having failed to become
a law the Secretary of the Treasury, in
April last, notified the holders of tin*
$195,(500.400 six per centum bonds then
outstanding that the bonds would Ik*
paid at par on the first day of July fob;
! lowing, or that they might be “contin
ued," at tho pleasure of the Government,
j to bear interest at the rate of three and i
1 one-half per centum per annum. Under
I this notice $178,055,150 of the six per
1 centum bonds were continued at the low
| rate, and $17,035,250 were redeemed.
In the month of May, a like notice
was given respecting the redemption or
continuance of the $439,841,350 of five \
j per centum bonds outstanding, and of.
; these. $401,504,900 were continued ui |
; three and one-half per centum per an
t nuin. and $38,33(5.450 redeemed. Tin;
1 (I per centum bonds of the loan of Feb
| ruary 8. 1801. and of llie Oregon war
debt, amounting together to >l-1.123.890
1 having matured /luring the year, the |
j Secretary of the Treasury gave notice of
i his intention to redeem the same, and
| such as have been presented have been
! paid from the surplus revenues. There i
i have also been redeemed at par, $1(5.179.-
i 190 of the 3V per centum continued bonds. ,
, making a total of bonds redeemed, or 1
• ! which have ceased to bear interest, dui
! ing the year of 123,909.550. The redne
; lion of the annual interest on the public !
i debt through these transactions is as fob j
lows; By reduction of interest to three
and one-half per cent... $10,478,952.25; j
by redemption of bonds, $0,352,3 hi; j*o
tal. $1(5.82(5.292 25. The three and one- 1
half per centum bonds, being payable
at the pleasure of the Government, are
available for the investment of surplus
revenue without the payment of premi
ums. Unless these bonds can be funded
I at a much lower rate of interest than
! they now bear, I agree with the Soereta
! ry of the Treasury that no legislation
i respecting them is desirable.
REDUCING THE REV I N! E.
|
It is a matter for congratuinatiou that
j the business of the century has been so
j prosperous during the past year as to
• yield by taxation a large surplus of Sn
i come to the Govern ment. If the reve
i line laws remain unchanged this surplus
must, year by year, increase, on account
i of the reduction of the public debt ami
: its burden of interest, and because of
tho rapid increase of our population. In
| 1800. just prior to the institution of our
internal revenue system, our population
but slightly exceeded 30.009,009. By
II the census of I*Bo it is now found to
exceed 50,000,000. It is estimated that.
; even if the annual receipts and expendi
tures should continue as at present, the
entire debt could be paid in ten years.—
In view however, of the heavy load of j
taxation which our people have already
borne, we may well consider whether it
is not the part of wisdom to reduce the
revenues, even if we delay a little the
1 payment of the debt.
It seems to me that the time has ar-
I rived when the people may justly dc
. mand some relief from their present on
, erous burden, and that, by doe economy
in the various branches of the public
! service, this may readily be afforded. 1
therefore, concur with the Secretary in
recommending the abolition of all inter
nal revenue taxes except those upon to
i bacco in its various forms, and upon dis
; tilled spirits and fermented liquors, and
I except, also, the special tax upon the
| manufacturers of and dealers in such ar
! tides.
1 The retention of the latter tax isdesir
; able as affording the officers ef the Gov
j eminent a proper supervision of these
i articles for the prevention of fraud. I
agree with the Secretary of the Treas
! ury that the law imposing a stamp tax
; upon matches, proprietary articles, play
ing cards, checks and draff s may with
propriety he repealed: and the law also
i by which hanks and hankers are assess
!cd upon their capital and deposits.
1 There seems to he a general sentiment
j in favor of this course.
REVISING THE TARIFF LAWS.
'fhe tariff laws also need revision, but
! that a due regard may be paid to the
i conflicting interests ot our citizens, ini- i
; portaut changes should be made with
caution. If .a careful revision cannot be
I made at this session, a committee, snub ,
i as was lately appointed by the Senate.
and is now being recoin mended by the
i Secrutary of the Treasury, would doubt- ;
i less lighten ii*n labors ot Uongress when
-1 ever this subject shail };• brought to its
| consideration.
THE WAR DEPARTMENT,
i The President endorses the recoin men
• datum of the Secretary of War for an iu
creaseof the army, details t he work done
during the last year in collecting Indians J
on their reservations, and says;
The report of the Uhief of Engineers j
furnishes a detailed account of the opei- i
atious for the improvement of rivers and I
harbors. I commend to your attention j
the Suggestions contained in this report j
in regard tc ibe condition of our fortiti- i
cations, especially on nmur defences, and i
recommend an increase of tha urengßi I
of the engineer battalion, by which the j
efficiency of our torpedo system would |
he improved. I also call your attention ,
j to the remarks upon tin* improvement of ;
j the South Pass of the Mississippi River, j
the proposed free bridge over the Poto- •
mac River at Georg town, the import- j
ancc of completing at an early day the •
north wing of the Department building, j
and other recommendations of the Secre- 1
tary of War, which appear in his report.
' The actual expenditures of (his Depart- |

j $44,541,27(5.91.
THE NAVY DEPARTMENT.
,
The report of the Secretary of the i
I .Navy exhibits the condition of that i
| branch of the service, and presents valu- !
abhi suggestions for its improvement. I i
call your especial attention, also, to tin* ;
appended report of the Advisory Board j
which he convened to device suitable
measures for increasing the efficiency of ;
the navy, and particularly to report as to !
the character and number of vessels ncc- i
essary to place it upon a footing common- j
surate with the necessities of the gov
rnmgut. 1 cannot too strongly urge i
I upon you n,y conviction that every con

I full appreciation of the fact that cotnpli- (

POSTAL SAVING BANKS.
The attention of Congress is again in
vited to tlie subject of establishing a
I system of savings depositories in connec
tion with tlie Post Office Department.
THE STAR ROUTES.
1 As lias been already stated, great re
ductions have recently been made in the
expense of the Star Route service. The
investiations of the Department ef Jus
tice and tlie Post Office Department have
resulted in the presentation of indict
ments against persons formerly connect
ed with that service, accusing them of
I offences against the 1 idted Slates. I
have enjoined upon the officials who are
charged with tlie conductor the eases
on the part of the government, and upon
the eminent counsel who, before my ac
cession to the Presidency, were called to
their assistance, tlie duty of prosecuting,
with the utmost rigor of the law. all
peisous who may he found chargeable
with frauds upon the postal service.
INDIAN AFFAIRS.
The rep >rt of the Secretary of the In
ti rior contains many valuable suggestions
particularly t mcliing upon the Indian
questions. r \ fie Indian should receive the
protection of the law. He should he
allowed to maintain in court his rights of
person and property, has repeatedly beg
ged for this privilege. Its exercise would
be very valuable to him in his progress
towards civilization, (ff even greater
importance is the enactment of a genera!
law permitting the allotment in severalty,
to such Indians at least as desire it, of a
reasonable quantity of land secured to
them by patent, and for their own pro
tection made inalienable for twenty of
twcnty-ive years, is demanded for their
present welfare and their permanent ad
vancement.
SUPPRESSING POL VGA MV.
For many years the Executive in his
annual message to Uongress has urged
the necessity of stringent legislation for
the suppression of polygamy in the Ter
ritories, and especially in the Territory
of Utah. The existing statute for the
punishment of this odious crime, so re
volting to the moral ami religious sense
of (’’n; ist n/lom, has been persistently and
contemptuously violated ever since its
'enactment. Indeed, in spite of commen
dable efforts on tin* part of tlie authori
ties v.ho represent the United States in
that Territ/u v, the law has in very rare
, instances been enforced, and. for a cause
to which reference will presently be made
is practically a dead letter. The fact
that adherents of the Mormon Uiiurch.
which zests upon polygamy as its corner
stone, have recently been peopling in large
numbers Idaho. Arizona and other of our
western territories, is well calculated to ■
: iixeitc the liveliest interest and appre- ;
hension. it imposes upon Congress and i
and the Executive the duty of arraying I
against the barbarous system the power i
which, under the Constitution and tlie
law, they can wield for its destruction. |
; Reference lias been already made to ]
thgso obstacles, wide!; the United States :
; officers hav.' encognfored in their efforts I
to punish violators of ttu* law. l\omi- j
nent among these obstacles is tlie diiii- j
; cully *f pioenring legal evidence sufii- I
ciciit to warrant a conviction even in the (
case of Hie most notorious offenders.
V.v.t attention is called to a recent !
opinion of li.e Supreme Court of the;
United States, explaining its judgment of J
reversal in the case of’Miles who had
been convicted of bigamy in Utah. The i
j Court refers to the fact, that the secrecy ■
; attending the celebration of marriages j
1 in that Territory makes the proof of ’
! p'iiygguiy vpry difficult, and the proprie
| tv is suggest-nd /,f ipqdilyjng Die lap of

PEXIJGN < LAI Ms.
It appears, from me rcr (| o *i n* ( i
missi/mer of Beiisions that, since I**s9, j
788,003 original pensions claims have j
| been filed; 450.949 of these have been j
allowed and inscribed on the pension roll j
72.539 have rejected and abandoned, be- j
j ing Th pigs ner cent, of the whole num
ber of claims sc* r f};ere are now |
j pending for settlement 205.513 original j
i pension claims, 227.040 of which were j
filled prior to July 1. I**o. These, when
allowed, will involve the payment of
arrears from the date of discharge incase
of an invalid, spid from date /! death or !
tennin ifion qf a prior right in all ofJier ;
casec. Ffniß the data obtainable it is |
estimated that it percent, uf t|;e num
ber of claims now pending will be. reject
ed or abandoned. This would show the ,
probable rejection of 34.040 cases, and |
the probable admission of about 193.900 '
claims, all of which involve the payment 1
of arrears of pension. With the present ;
force employed, the number of adjudi
cations remaining the same, and no new
business intervening, this number of
claims (193,009) could be acted upon iu j
a period of six years, ami taking January !
I, I*B4. as a near period from wliich to
estimate in each case nu average amount
of arrears, it is found that every case al- .
lowed would require for the first payment *
* upon It il.p sum of $1350. Multiplying
- this amount by the whole number of
probable admissions, gives $250,(MH.00U
: as tiie sum required for first payments.
This represents the sum which must
i be paid upon claims which we refused
. before July 1, I*B9, and are now pi-mi ing
and entitled to the. benefits of the arrears
ad. From the: amount (259.900.990) may
be deducted from ten to fifteen millions
1 for cases win re the claimant dying there
1 is no person who under the law' would be
entitled to succeed to the pension, leaving
>'235.999,009 ;s tho probable amount to
‘ be paid.
‘ In these estimates no ‘account has been
taken of tho 38.590 cases filed since June
■ 3*0(1). I**9. ami now pending, which must
received attention as current business,
i hut which /Id rot involve the payment of
any arrears beyond tin* date of tiling the
claim. Of this numb r it i.% estimated
i that *' per cent, will be allowed. As
I lias been stated with the present force of
t in; Pension Bureau, 375 clerks, it is esti
mated that it w ill take six years to dis
pose of (he claims now pending.
It is stated by tho Commissioner of
1 , Pensions that by an addition of 259 clerks
■ increasing the adjudicating force rather
than the mechanical), double the amount
of work could be accomplished, so tiiat
: these cases could be acted upon within
three years. Aside from the considera
tions of justice which may be urged for
a speedy self lenient of the c aims now I
on tlie files of the Pension (• liicc, it is no
! i’*ss important on the score of economy,
inasmuch as fully one-third of the cleri
cal force of the ofiices now wholly occu
. pied in giving attention to correspondence
; with the thousands of H Fu.iaiits whose
cases have been on the tiles for the past
eighteen years, the fact that a sum so
enormous may he expended by the Gov
ernment to meet demand for arrears of
pensions, is an admoaitiou to Uongress
: and the Executive to give cautious con
sideration to any similar project in tin*
. future. The great tempi.iti/m to the pre
| ' s ntaiiou of tictitious ehtims afforded by
1 the fact that the average sum obtained
up u each applicate n is $1309 leads me
to suggest the propriety of making some
special appropriation for the prevention i

!\ !!. SEBV H I-: REFORM.
I pon this question the President says:
i In my letter accepting the nomination !
* j for the Viee-Presi/icncy, I state/* that, in :
*! my judgment-. ":m nan should be the
: incumbent of an office, the duties of
s which he is for aiy cause unfit to per
form, who is hu king in the ability, fulel*
1 S y or integrity which a proper adminis
i t ration of such office demands/’ This j
‘ ’ sentiment would doubtless meet with ,
1 general acquiescence, but opinion has
; been Avid< !y divided upon the wisdom
and practicability of the various reform
atory schemes which have been suggest
ed and of certain proposed regulations
, governing appointments to public office.
. The efficiency m such regulations has
been distrusted mainly because they
. 1 nve seemed to exalt mere educational
’ ; and abstract tests above general business
ip.icitv and even special fitness for the
r p irticuhir work in hand. It seems to me
[ that tne rules which slmuld be applied to
. ; tlie management of the public service
may properly conform in the main to
t such as regulate the conduct of success
ful private business. Original appoint- |
( incuts should he based upon ascertained J
•fitness. The tenure of office should be
| s able. Positions of responsibility should
s ( far as possible be tilled by t lie promo
r; n of worthy and efiie.icut officers. The
investigation of al! complaints and the
punishment /! al! official misconduct
should be prompt and thorough.
There arc very many characteristics
11 wliich go t make a model civil servant.
■ Frominent am/uig them are probity, in
‘ dnstry, g/>o/l sense, good habits, good
temper, patience, order, courtesy, tact, ;
si If-reliance, manly deference to superior
’ officers, ami manly c/>nsideration for in
* f/’i iors. The absence of these traits is
* not supplied with (lie knowledge of
! books or by promptitude in answering
questions, or by any other quality likely
1 t'/ be brought to light by competitive ex
aminations To m ike success in such a
: contest, therefore, an indispensable con-
I /iiiion of public employment, would very
likely result in tlie practical exclusion of
the older applicants, even though they
might possess qualifications far superior
to their younger and more brilliant com
petitors. The suggestions must not be j
* regarded as evidencing any spirit of op
position to tlie competitive plan, which
has been, to some extent, successfully
employed already, and which hereafter
may vindicate the claim of iis most earn
est supporters. j •
But it ought to be seriously considered
whether application of the same educa
tional standard to persons of mature
, years, and to young men fresh from
school and college, would not be likely
to exalt mere intellectual proficiency j
above other qualities of equal or greater
| importance. Another feature of the pro- 1
posed system is the selection by promo- I 1
tion of all officers of the government
above the lowest grade, except such as
w. aid fairly bo legarded us exponents of
tiie policy of the executive and the prin
i ciplcs of tho dominant party.
To afford encouragement to faithful
public servants by exciting iu their minds
■ the hope of promotion if they are found to
merit it is much lo be desired. But ■
■ would it be wise to adopt a rule so rigid ‘
as to permit no other mode of supplying 1 ■
the walks of Uie service’.* There are j 1
i many persons who till subordinate posi- '
! tions with great credit, but lack those |
| qualities which are requisite for higher '
posts of duty: ami besides, the modes /if i
; *l. light and a&tion of onu whose service ! '•
: in a governmental buieau lias been long :
continued are often so cramped by rou- \
I line ]>rocedure as almost to disqualify | '
I him from instituting changes required by ! /
• ;Ih* public interests. An infusion of new ! '
: blood from time to time into the middle ’
I ranks of tiie service might he very bene- , i
! licial In its results. Tiie subject under i
i discussion is one of grave importance, j (
•1 3< ♦•vils v/hich are complained of can- : •
not be eradicated at once. The work ! >
| must be gradual. i

MEETING OF CONGRESS.
Congress met on Monday last, in the
Senate President pro tempore Davis oc
cupied the chair, and Senator-elect Win
dom, of Minnesota, was sworn in. A
number of hills were introduced, among
them the following: liy .Mr. Deck, to
provide for the retirement of the trade
dollar: by Mr. Sherman, to provide fur
issue of d per cent bonds: by Mr. (Jar
land. for a TariiV Commission; by Mr.
Morrell, (or a tariff and tax commission;
by Messrs, (hover and Miller. I restrict
1 Chinese immigration: and by Mi. f.ap-
I bam. to punish attempts to assassinate
: ‘ he President. Mr. Frye ottered a reso
lution. which was laid over, providing
I for a special committee of seven, to con
sider ameiidmems to the Presidential
i election laws. Mr. Edmunds offered a
resolution that the standing and special
committees of last session be revived and
i continued. Mr. Pugh ottered an amend
ment that the President of the Senate be
; authorized to decide upon the represen
tation ot the respective parties on said
’ committees. Pending the matter the
i Senate adjourned.
The assembling of the first regular
session of the Forty-seventh Congress
had the effect of drawing to the Capitol
a vast number of visitors. As early as
ten o'clock the approach leading to the
building presented a lively appearance,
and by eleven every seat in the galleries
of the House of Representatives (except
in the space reserved for the Diplomatic
Corps) was tilled, even tlie steps leading
to them being utilized as seating places.
<>n the floor the members indulged ii
cordial handshaking and greetings. Air.
Keifer stood for a short time in the rear
i of the desks and was warmly congratu
i lated by bis colleagues upon his success
in obtaining the Republican nomination
for Speaker.
The hum of conversation and t he bursts
of noisy laughter continued till twelve
o'clock, when it was promptly hushed,
when the Clerk of the House, Mr. Adams,
called the body to order and announced
the opening of the session. He then pro
ceeded to call the roll, beginning with
the State of Alabama. The roll call dis
closed the presence of -So Representa
tives elect: and the list of absentees was
I called. The roll call was then finished
and showed that 290 Representatives had
answered to their names, the absentees
being Messrs. Morse, Scales, Mills and
Deuster.
The election of officers of the House
was next in order, and resulted as fol
lows: J. tV. Keifer, of Ohio, was elect
ed Speaker by 14. s vot.ns to 129 for S. J.
Randall, and s for Nicholas Ford. The
mcmbers-clect were then sworn in, ob
jections to a number of them having
been overruled by the House. The or
ganization of the House was then com
pleted by the election of Edward Mc-
Pherson as Clerk, and also the other can
didates nominated by the Republican
caucus. Pending action on a resolution
continuing the rules of the last Congress
until otherwise ordered, the House ud
■ journed.
HKKUAY.
In the Senate several additional bills
were introduced, among them one for
the admission of Dakota as a State, and
one by Mr. Pendleton for the reform of
the civil service. Resolutions wore sub
mitted by Messrs Deck and Maxey, di
recting the Judiciary Committee to in
quire whether legislation is necessary to
provide for the Presidential succession in
ease of vacancy. The resolutions were
laid on the tabic, with the undestanding
that they should be called up for discus
sion next Tuesday. The President's mes
sage was received, read, and ordered to
be printed. Mr. Sherman's resolution
for the appointment of a joint commit,
tec to prepare an expression of the sen
timent of the nation in regard to the
death of President Garfield was taken
up and agreed to. Several other hills
were introduced, among them one by
Mr. Blair, for the support of tHe com
mon schools of the Inited States. Mr.
Edmund* 1 resolution continuing the Sen- \
ate Committees was passed.
In the House, all the Territorial Dele
gates, except the Delegate from I tail,
were sworn in. Mr. Haskell, of Kansas,
ottered a resolution that Allan G. (’amp
bell be sworn in us Delegate from I tali,
but after some discussion the matter was
postponed. The President's Message was
read, ordered printed, and referred to the
Committee of the Whole, Mi. Kinley, ,
of Ohio, offered a resolution, which was |
unanimously adopted, for the appoint- i
ment uf a committee of one member from 1
each State represented, to act incoujunc- ■
tion with a Senate committee, to prepare j
a suitable expression in regard to the \
death of President Garfield. Mr. McEane
asked leave to offer a resolution asking 1
the President to communicate to the I
House the instructions sent to our Min
isters to Chili and Peru, but Mr. Robe
son objected. The House then ad journed
until Friday, with the understanding that
a further adjournment should then he i
taken until Tuesday.
WEDNESDAY.
In the Senate r. number of bills were
introduced, among them one by Air.
Plumb, making trade dollars a legal ten- j
dei, except where otherwise expressly |
stipulated in the contract, and on? by j
Mr. Davis, establishing a Department of i
Agriculture and Commerce. Air. Hoar |
offered a resolution, which was referred,
for the appointment of a special Com-!
mittee on Woman Suffrage. Mr. Alor- \
rill’s Tax Commission resolution came j
up in order, but that gentleman, “ pre- !
ferring not to weary the Senate with a
long speech at this time.** moved an ad
journment, which was agreed to.
