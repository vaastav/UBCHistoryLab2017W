Unfavorable Aspect of tbe Cuban Question
So Congress.
At the dinner part/ given by Governor Swan n to
his fellow member* of tne House Committee on
Foreign Affairs last evening, tho question of Cuba
was the mam subject of conversation. It was
brought up by an incidental reference of one of tne
(entlemen present to the allusion to Cuba in the
President's Message. From the interchange
of opinions that took r'ace, it seems
that all the members of the committee,
democrats as well as republicans, are opposed to
?ny action at present, especially anything like urg
ing the President to accord belligerent rights to
tbe Cubans. General Hanks, the chairman of the
committee, was not present, not having returned
from Europe; but It is thought Ills influence would
not be sufficient, even if he were here, to overcome
tbe meinoersof the committee so as to get them
to favor Cuba. The Senate Committee on Foreign
Relations is divided on ne subject. Air. Sumner,
lu chairman, Is more determined than ever in his
opposition to the recognition of the insurgents, his
position has been greatly strengthened by the tone
of the President's Message on foreign aifalrs; for
whatever interpretation other persons may put upon
the President's language towards Cuba, Mr. Sumner
thinks it docidedly against them, or rather against
tbeir recognition, wnlch is the same thing. General
Cameron, the second member on tti,e committee, is
friendly to the Cubans, and Is doing all he can, in a
qniet way, to get their case beiore me senate,
?o that it may have a fair hearing. His
resolution offered to-day catling for information
from the President with regard to the progress of
tne revolution will, he hopes, bring out something
which may be more convincing to Senators than it
has been to Secretary Fish, that the Cuban cause
has assumed such a shape as to entitle it to attention
from our government. Senators Morton and Schurz
are also understood to be lavorable to the Cubans,
but Harlan, Patterson and Cassorly are said to be
?With Sumter, though open to argument and con
vie lion.
Admission or Vlrsiuia-TUo People Accept the
Hitualion?A Colored legislator?Defence of
Virginia Loyalty.
The Committee from the legislature of Virginia
waited on the Keconstruction committeo this morn
ing and presented their views In writing, brletly le
citiug what had been done in tho Suto toward car
tying out tho Reconstruction acts and asserting that,
what had been done by the people of Virginia was
In good faith and that tho constitution, as far as
adopted, shall be carried out to tho very letter
and spirit of its lntant and Jaw. This
was briefly advocatod by Speaker Turner
and Crenshaw, of the House delegates, and by Air.
Illne. Mr. Piatt, republican member of Congress
?)?ct from the Second district, advocatod the uncon
ditional admission of Virginia, without applying the
tost oath to members or the Legislature. He was
followed by Mr. Porter, republican member elect
from tho Third district, who opposed the Immediate
admission of tho State; but in order to facilitate
reconstruction advised that the test oath bo adiuiul -
tered to members of the Legislature, excluding mem
bers who could not take it, and supplying their places
with those who could from the next highest on the
election returns. He also suggested, as another
plan of reconstruction, the submission of the con
stitution, with tho test oath and disfranchising
clauses included. These views were opposed on the
ground that a new election would bo rendered
necessary, as the application of that oath would
reduce tho number of members to less than
a quorum and ? also involve the re elec
tion of United states Senators. Mr. Bland,
a colored member of the Legislature, made
a speech in favor or immediate admission
without the constitution. He made an emphatic
address, declaring that the State had done every
thing she could do consistent with her honor to tes
tily to the national government her obedience to its
authority and to the laws of Congress. He, there
fore, protested against any administering of the test
oath to her Legislature, and contended that the
State was loyal to the core and fully entitled to
every privilege and right accorded to the other loyal
States, Governor Walker, who was present by re
quest, addressed tho Keconstruction Committee, and
Wrongly endorsed the declaration of the legislative
committee that the terms of tho constitution would
he strictly adnered to, and spoke of the loyalty of
the people as deserving of a prompt recognition by
the immediate admission of tho state into the
Union.
The Virginians were requested to reduce their
views to writing and present their papers to the
committeo at tho meeting next Saturday morning.
Notwithstanding the contrariety of views it is be
lieved the committee will report a bill for the ad
mission of Virginia on the plcdgo that the constitu
tion will be carried out in good faith.
The Go orila Case?Obstacle* to Another Ke
construction.
The Senate Judiciary Committee had np the
gia cose to-day, but came t$ no CQfcSlusion. The
committee And a good (Teal ot dimcuity in the mat
ter of setting aside the acts of Legislatures which
have intervened since the State wis formally ad
Bitted to Congress. This would have to be done, it
to thought, In carrying out the suggestions
of the President's Message relative to Georgia.
Revision of the Tariff-Additions to the Free
Mot.
mere la a general disposition among members to
place articles which may bo termed the necessaries
? ot Ufa on the list ot free imports. Two or
three bills have been Introduced looking to this
object and referred to the Committee of Ways and
Means. Another was introduced In the House
to-day by Mr. Stevenson, of Ohio. It provides lor
the removal ot import duties from coffee, tea, salt,
nuredned sugars, molasses, paper and lumber. It
la hardly probable that a measure Including so many
articles will receive favorable attention from the
Ways and Means Committee. The pica of the com
mittee is that wo cannot aOord Just now to do with
out the amount of revenue dorlvcd from import du
ties on articles ao generally used as tea and coffee,
Of coarse the Southern members will oppose the re
moval of the tariff from sugar and molasses.
ConcreMBian Fox After the Wall Street Weld
Operator*.
The effort of Mr. Fox, of New York, to get a se
lect committee of Ave appointed to investigate the
cause of the memorable gold speculation and panic
in Wall atreet might have been more aaccossfni had
bis resolution been differently worded. ConpUng
the names of the fteaiucnt and the Secretary ot th?
Treasury with the Wall street speculation was too
much for the republicans, ana considered in bad
taste by many of the democrats, and, of course, ob
jection was made to the Introduction of the bill.
Mr. Fb* proposes to Introduce it at another time,
under the regular call for House resolutions. In the
meantime he will probably reconstruct It.
Senatorial Dignity at a Discount.
The silly resolution of Senator Drake ordering the
floor of the Senate to be cleared teu minutes before
the assembling of that august body, which passed
yesterday, was reconsidered to day on motion of
Senator Thayer, of Nebraska. Drake undertook to
stand upon his senatorial right* and dignity.
Wnen his magnificent figure enters the Senate
chamber lie would have the rabble know that
they aro not only to stand to ono side
but to get out altogether. The people are
not supposed to bo able to stand la Uio
presence of such distinguished men as the verbose
and pompous senator from Wisconsin. Senator
Thayer has become more accustomed to his honors
lhau Drake and is not above rubbing against the
poople who come to look at the Senate Chamber and
the Senators, ills gentle reminder that the people
ore the masters, even of the Senators, did not seem
to go down well with Drake, who is understood to
tie a candidate for re-election; but it frightened huu
int?a compromise, so that the time for clearing the
floor was reduced from ten to live minutes before
the time of meeting.
The Supreme Court*
In the Supreme Court to-day was argued the case
of the City 01 Mew Orleans, plaintitf in error, vs.
the New York steamship Company. It involves the
question of the power of the military-municipal
authorities of New Orleaus to lease city property.
The case, however, was not heard on Its merits, the
court suggesting doubts as to jurisdiction.
Nominations by the President.
The President has nominated John P. Dillon, of
Iowa, to be Circuit Judge of the Eighth Judicial
Circuit, and Pierre Remiugtou to be Collector of
Customs for the district of OBwegatcbie, N. V., vice
George Parker# removed.
White and Black Doctors in Washington?The
District Medical Society to be Annihilated.
Sumner opened one of his big assaults to-day upon
the District Medical Society, which has set its face
against colored doctors and relused to allow them
to become members or even to hold consultation
with them. Last summer, it will be remembered,
two dark doctors applied to be admitted to member
shin of the Medical Society in this city, but were
blackballed witnonc mercy. These colored doctors
threatened that they would bring the matter before
Congress and have a law passed which would com
pel their white colleagues in the sawbones liues to
receive them on a professional equality. That their
threat was not an idle one was shown to-day by the
vigorous manner in which Sumner brought up and
pressed his motion to have the charter of the Medi
cal Society revoked. Sumner launched into one of
his tremendous little speeohes on our colored friend
and brother, aud declared that the Washington
killers and curers were nothing short of barba
rians and savages. Sumner declared that
he intended to show tbeso white doctors that
they must not sot themselves up as obstacles
to the civilization of the age. It is said that the
next move in advance by the Massachusetts states
man is to be a resolution or bill permitting btack3
and whites to attend the public schools 01 the Dis
trict, and, perhaps, forcing theatre proprietors to
make no distinction on account of race or color.
Illegal Fees Charged by luteraal Revenue
Officers.
Supervisor Dutcher, of New York, writes to Com
missioner Delano that a practice prevails to a con
siderable extent in his district by the revenue officers
charging for their services in making out papers
that the law requires the taxpayers to furnish, aud
asks if such officers have a right to do it. Mr. Delano
replies that the practice cannot be sanctioned by the
revenue office and must not be permitted to pre
vail. and that all internal revenue officers who have
taken money for such purposes and who refuse to
refund the same at once will be dismissed from the
service.

RETORT FROM TUB COMMITTEE OK rRlNTINO.
Mr. Anthony, (rep.) of K. I., in presenting a
report from the Committee on Printing, said be in
tended ere long to call attention to toe necessity for
some reform in the matter of public printing; the
report being a provision for the printing o( 20,000
copies ol the report of the Commissioner of Agricul
ture.
Mr. Pomeroy, (rep.) of Kan., remarked that the
farmers and agriculturists ot the country were inter
ested in this report, winch was one to subserve their
interests, and was deserving of circulation for tnat
reason.
The report of the committee, and similar reports
from the same source lor the publication of various
reports, were discussed. In regard to the publication
01 a map of the United states illustrative ot the laDd
resources of the country, to be made in connection
with the report of the Commissioner of the General
Kami onice, considerable discussion ensued.
Messrs. Poiueroy, Sumner and llowe agreed in the
opinion that an original plan ol a map of the country
was essential, inasmuch as the map heretofore pub
lished was ten years old, while during the last de
cade the geographical appearance of the country had
entirely changed.
Mr. Harlan, (rep.) of Iowa, remarked that it was
important that maps officially published by tho
United states government bIioukI contain the latest
and fullest observations of surveys, exact locations
of bays, rivers and KOunraiM; *" ^ ie.
Mr. Ajjthojj* fcakl that the trawication of a map
aspTCptaea became simply a questiou of .money, as I
the expenditure for a map would equal fWMNO; A
high tribute to the emciency and indfisli'y of the
t:"!"!2i!"loner of the Land oilice was incidentally
paid.
No definite action was taken In regard to the pro
posed map, and the reports from the commutoe
were agreed to.

Mr. Carpenter, (rep.) of Wis., introduced a bill

Mr. Morton, (rep.) of Ind., presented a memorial
from members of the Legislature of Virginia urging
that the state ne admitted to representation in Con
gress. Laid on Hie table.
Mr. Sumner, trep.) of Mass., offered a resolution
directing the Committee for the District of Columbia
to consider the expediency 01 repealing the charter
of the Medical Soclotv of the District of Columbia,
and of taking such other legislation as may bo ne
cessary to secure for medical practitioners in the
District of Columbia equal rights and opportunities
without distinction or color.
Mr. Norton, (rep.) of Minn., objected to the imme
diate consideration of the resolution.
Mr. Sumner said ir the occasion lor tho resolution
wa.i known there would. perhaps, be no objection to
it. A surgeon who had been brevcued a colonel for
his services in the Union canse was now a practicing
physician in Washington, and he, with another

COMMITTEE OK TUB WHOLE?T11E CENSUS Blt.U
"l h# House then went into Committee 01 the Whole
on Uto state of the luion, Mr. Dawks in the chair,
aud resumed the cousuleratiou of the Census bin.
A discussion grew up and was participated in by
many of the members as to the most economical
maimer of taking the census, Mr. Butler, of Mass.,
cohtending that t/ie work could be best and most
appropriately penormed by the oillcers 01 the in
ternal revenue, auu Mr. GarUeld holumg the ground
that small economy m this matter womd be waaie
lulness.
Mr. sookiei.d, commenting on the remarks of his
colleague, Mr. Ketley, ridiculing the idea ot false
ocouomy iu this matter, said he would like his col
league to read his own speeches delivered In l'enn
sylvuma durum the lust fail campaign in favor of the
repuoucati party as the party of ecouoniy.
Mr. KitLM.i , (rep.) oi l'a., asked his colleague to
state whether he had ever suggested in any of his
speeches tuat it was wise ocouomy to save pence
aud throw away pounds.
Mr. Scopus Li) could not say that his colleague bad
said that; but his colleague had said a great many
foolish tilings, aud ne might possibly have said that,
too. (Laughter.) He believed, ? after all, that the
saiegt and best vvav was to go oaicii to the old mode
aud let the census be taken by the United States
inarsuals, who were bonded omcers, und luauy of
whom had experience in the matter. He had exa
mined last night the old Census bill of i860, und
lound that many ot the best leatures of the present
bill were transcripts from that. Ha liked them
boat. Tuey nad reminded a witty iriend of his of
Macau lay's reply to a green young man who nad
written a comedy und Sent him a copy:?
Your comedy I've road, my friend,
Aud IUc tbe pan yuu ?iule tb? oest;
If still tho piny you wmli to niruu,
Take courage, man, and steal tbe re?t.
(I.ana titer.) so if Hie Census Committee were to
take the wnole bill 01 lbo>, aud make 1 lie necessary
alterations iu it, lie tnought it would be an improve
ment ou tne pending bin.
Mr. Ut'-ii.RK, (rep.) 01 Mass., wishlnar to test the
sense of the liouse ou whetner the present machinery
01 tne government shouid be used lor using the cen
sus or wuetuer a new set of oillcers shouid be created,
moved to amend the Kourth section by making it
read, that it shall be the uuty of 1 he ussessor oi the
internal revenue 111 each district to causa all the
Inhabitants to be enumerated. Here was a weli
paio, weii-traiued aud thoroughly silted body of o/ll
cers who could do the work well. As to the objec
tion urged by Mr. Garileld that the people might not
like to give information to the internal revenue om
cers lest it might nave wine effect on their taxes, 11c
did not think mere was mucit lorce In thau Every
one knew that the census wus for the
very purpose oi ascertaining the proportion of
taxes, nnu every one would see tuat it was Just as
necessary 10 give auswers truly to the assistant
assessor ab to au enumerator. If members were
now to vote ft* the appointment t% a uew oilicer in
each oi tlicir districts, with tne appointment of a
number ol sub-oincerx, eueti with as mauv elerk&as
no could get, they would be accused, however Justly
or unjiiHiiy, of voting that amount ot patronage into
their bands, and they nad got as much load 01 that
description to carry as they ought to loau them
selves with and run a good race next lali. Ksne
olally was that so when they had already a set of
1 omceri with very uttie 10 do, ana who could do this
ccujus wort wnuout auy cnarge to tue Treasury
Mr. Maynard, (rep.) 01 lenn., argued that it was
not to oe expected that with tne rate of cumpensa
tion provided lor enumerators (four doiiars a day
for sixty days) competent men could uot oe pro
cured or that anj tiling like a complete census would
be taken by them. In woiue respects liothougbt well
01 the proposition of the gentleman from Massachu
setts (Mr. ilutlcr).
Mr. SroKEs, (rep.) of Tenn., chairman of the
Census Committee replied to Mr. Mayuurd objection
and expressed his conviction thai competent men
could be sol |0f lour uollars per day, winch was all
that members of me Tennessee Legis ature received.
Mr. Jui>D argued on the great importance of the
statistical 111101 matioii to be obtained oy the census
taken, not only by the Legislative Department of tne
country, but for the national creditors abroad, and
expressed ills sentiment that no ideas of economy
should be permuted to intervene us au obstacle to a
perfect and complete census.
Mr. gaukiklu also rep.ted to the argument In
favor ot eiuplojiiug the Internal Revonue officers to
lake the census, taking the ground that the tax
gatherer was au omcer odious to tho people, who
should bo thoroughly convinced that the
census had no connection whatever with taxation,
l'he whole cost of taking the ceusus of i85u, exclu
sive of priuting and publishing, was H.ais.ooo, and
ol that suui $?w,00i) was for the payment of assist
ant marshals, who did the work winch tne enumer
ators would have 10 do. The lorce of assistant asses
sors was now very small ami it wount oe necessary
to appoint almost as many new oillcers and auents
under the proposition of the gentleman from Massa
chusetts as under the bill reported by the committee
and these otllcers would have a dollar a day more
thai; was promised for enumerators; so tnaithc geu
t'eman's proposition would not reduce the total ex
pense one stiver; and besides, the whole wont would
be rendered odious and mainly nugatory.
Mr. A1.1.isov, (rep.) of Iowa, a member of the Cen
sus committee, also arirued against the amendment
oiiered by ?r. Hutier. that proposition had been
fully and caremlly considered by the committee aud
had been rejected. One ot tue great objections to it
was ttiat it wouid absolutely, for the time belnz
interfere with the legitimate duties of the Internal
Revenue Dcpartmeut. \\a? the Commissioner of
Internal Revenue to be diverted iroiu his great and
legitimate business for six or seven monins 111 the
year iu order to attenu to the business of collecting
census statisticsy
Mr. Btrri.ER said his plan did not propose to Inter
fere with the duties of tne Commissioner of internal
Revenue, hut to place the assessors, lor this pur
pose, under the Census superintendent.
Mr. Ali.ibon remarked that then the proposition was
sun more objectionable, because it wouid place the
assessors anil assistant assossois undor two separate
and distinct Jurisdictions, which would make ? con
fusion worse conlounded." it would i>e linpossiblo
for them to act under two distinct and separate
deportments of tbe government. He would be very
glad ir tbe expense of taking the census could be re.
dnced, but tbe primary and great objection t6 lliV
system proposed by the gentleW from M?8&hu!
T*18. 1 ft w?re with the legiti
ment 118 of lnlerflal Kcvbuue Depart
Ml\ Wooft, (dcm.) of N. Y., thought ihat the
?rtrtiidmcni offered by Mr. Butler was not without
merit, uiut said that his first impulse had been to
favor auvthlng which would restrict the patronage
of the administration, but, considering the vast
Interests at stake, ami knowing that the whole value
ot the census depended on iw precision and accu
racy, he woulu not allow any feel lug of a partisan
character to interfere with It. The people of Isew
Yoik city had very reluctantly come into the system
of internal taxation. For months and years
honest men in that city had striven to com
mend it to their constituents not to evade
their responsibility to the government which
allowed it to contribute to tu expenses.
Among the poorer classes, who had suffered from
being dratted into the war, and from all
sorts of inquisitorial investigations Into their pri
vate and other ailuirs, the people naturally shrunk
from assessors and collectors of internal revenue.
They have au lnstlnctlvo aversion to giving those
oiliceix that information which should oe obtained
in order to have the centus what it ought to be.
This bill not oniy proposed a ccnsu.i of the popula
tion, but to go lar beyond thuPand to impure into
the most private and sacred affairs of life--inquiries
winch had never before been made either under this
or any other government. When the government
semis its emissary into n household it uiusl scud at
least an acceptable u?ent, whom the people would
honestly mtd truthfully communicate with. Was the
assistant assessor of that class t lie thought not.
Referringu> tho Now York census of 1*66, lie sun
mat i/.eii It as a shameful partisan fraud upon the
people, which had cut down the population of the
City by U50,000 lor Uic purpose oi not allowing it
proper representation in the .-Mate Legislature. In
lact. It was aJmitttd to be no census at all.
Mr. Jesckks, (rep.) of u. l? mrreed that there was
something or vauie lu each of the pending proposi
tions, and that wiuie the assessors should not be
employed to take enumeration, the statistical In
formation possessed by the Interna: Kevenue bureau
snould be utilized lor the purpose oi the census.
Mr. iti ri.i u, Of Mass., closed Hie debate by an
argument in support of his amendment. He claimed
uu?i UMder it tiwre would ih> greatyr eOlcieacj,
greater promptitude, greater accuracy and greater
economy. The gcutleuian from Nov Yurie (Mr. Wood)
Lad informed me committee that tne census of HS5
in rim .state, made by tin- republican party, hail been
entirely a fraud. Tri^p corollary to tliat would seem
to be mat mere should be do census ta.eu ar all.
There might be an ldiosyncracy about New Yorlc,
that nothing could be done there which was not a
fraud in some way or lorm, but he truKfvl there
counl be au honest census taken. He ad nil '.ted that
there was great danger that nothing couid be lountt
oui. iu New York about elections, auout tlie census,
about gold speculations or aboqt schemes of every
sort. It seemed to be one living mass of corruption
and fraud, of which the gentleman i-Mr. Wood; was
a representative. (Laughter.)

LECTURES LAST NIGHT.
THE CIRCULATION AND HE NEHVOUS SYSTEM.
Lfcturo by Mr*. Walter C. L)mnn.
Mrs. Walter C. Lyman gave the fourth lectors of
bor series of physiological lectures to ladies yester
day aiter/ioon, in ttie lecture room or Dr. Chapin's
church, on "Circulation and the Nervous System."
A large number of highly intelligent and delighted
ladie testified their appreciation o< the subject and
the lecturer. The nature and office of the blood,
the structure of the heart, its valves, veins and
arteries, were clearly illustrated; also the manner
in which the blood is conveyed ironi the extreme
parts of the body through the veins to the heart,
how it is punbed by tue iuugs. aud how it U re
turned by the arteries and capillaries to all parts
of the Joly to butld up and restore waste.
Ever.v movement, every thought even, she said,
break3 down or causes waste In some portiou of the
human system, and the heart and lungs are con
tinually puiting lorth renewed eiforis to supply
thl.s waste, There are in a full grown person about
twenty-eight pounds of blood, and once in aoout
two and a half minutes this blood makes a
complete circuit of the body, in twenty-four
noun about eight tons of blood are passed
throush the heart, where it is pressed or forced
luto the lungs; there punUcd by couung in

to nourish and support life, for the
' blood is the life" or all animal existence.
The veins that carry the blood from the whole body
to the heart ate spread iiko a dclicate n<*work over
tbe outer surface, under the ><kin; no portion of it
but is sutplied with thetn; bni they are most abund
ant about the head aud neck, 'ihe orain consumes
much more blood than any other organ in the sys
tem. Kxcrcise causes healthy circulation of blood;
and if there is not plenty of good fresh air inhaled
we get no good arterial blood. Deep breathing was
shown to be much more beuctlclai than light
breathing, as the latter does not aerate
the lungs, in which are many millions of
air tubes, which, if not allowed tbe needful
quant.ty of fresh air, becomes Unpaired
in action and produce the long catalogue of fright

care of these much-abused organs and cheat tbe
doctors, improve taelr health, increase their enjoy

Ac. A good circulation of blood cannot be pre
served Iu dark, lil-ventiiated rooms. Xervous cir

the bodily ailments. Many women are to-uay dying for

"S!1AX:PEAR? !N THE NINETEENTH CEIJTIM."
Lecture by the Itev. llr. Stork* of Philadel
phia.
The last of the course of lectures on popui* sub
jects given by the Young Men's Christian Associa
tion of. l James' Lutheran church, Fifteenth street,
between Second and Third avenues, was (levered
last evening by the Kev. T. Stork, D. D., of Phila
delphia, who took for his subject "Shakspoare in the
Nineteenth Century." The church was well lliled by
an audience winch evinced the liveliest Interest in
the theme.
Dr. Stork, in a very pleasant manner, entering
upon the subject said, that If a cieflfcvman seventy
years ago had been invited by a committee to spend
an evening with Shakspeare, he wou.d have been
considered to possess but little religion or morality.
Buttin.es have changeJ, and the great dramatic
author's religion cau now be compared to the sanio
spirit ihat actuated Napoleon when lie said Ins great
battles were earned on"to establish Sunday school*."
The parly* lifo of snakspeare and the loci leuts ot his
tbeu outward existence and what it developed were
given graphically and eloquently. To give a sketch of
the man seemed absurd, as U was like try mgtoput a
mountain oak in a little vase. Critics never knew,
or never will Know, what to do witli Inm. He was
the great master of the human heart, the great de
lineator ot all passions, and his simplicity was as
his philosophy, the child entwined In tin: man. Yon
cannot take any of his thoughts and put them Into
oilier clothing. any more than attempting to trans
ler trie siui of one being Into another. jShak
speire wis the true Adam of English literature.
His morality is decided 1/ expressed in his worts,
an 1 Ulere <? ;nnot be louud one that is entire that
has not such tendencies. He never volunteered to
steal the ro!>e or heaven to dciend the devil, lie
was ncyer false, llis complete ana comprehensive
humanity mid In.? highest sympathy with it enable
him to touch the conceits of every age. The falla
cies and vagaries at this age he had antici
pated. l'he diudy, that remarkable specie; the
dress an-l lashion of the day, witn its absurdity;
drunkenness. women's riniits and female suffrage
and infidelity. These, the lecturer sal 1. as so truth
fully delineated in his works, had their application
now: and Hie solemnity oi death was nevermore
impressively portrayed than In the dying moments
of Falsiaff. The passages Dr. dtarkselected to ilius.
trate Hie points oi the discourse gave turn thti oppor
tune to conclude in a grand ana poetical perora
tion.
THE LITERARY HSTOtt OF THE B3LL
The Rev. W. A. I'acon delivered a lecture last even
ing at the rooms of the New York City .Mission, cor
ner of Leonard and Centre streets, on the "Literary
History of the Bible." The hall, which could seat
about eighty persons, was not over half filled. The
audience was composed mainly of children. There
Were, however, a few adults present, mainly per
sons of color.
The reverend gentleman opened his discourse with
a history of the various methods of expressing Ideas
in writing which men have from tiino to time *
adopted, and gave an interesting description of the
signs and character* used in nncient manuscripts,
aud still round iu the rutus of temples ami mauso
leums in Thebes and other aucicm cities, and, leaving
obelisks, brazen serpents an i hieroglyphics, an <>f
which wore illustrated bv tne black board figures
exhibited, the speaker came down in a few rapid
sentences to tlin days of tlie printing press. He said
tho urst revolution ot the wheel or that press
Bent forth a wave thar. shook the tbrone
of the Pontiff and ihe crown of tne
monarch. It spread the Bible broadcast on the
world, winch, as the reverend gentleman alleges,
the i'opi-s have always endeavored to conceal from
the people. He was an enemy ot persecution and
denied mat any power ou earth could make laws to
