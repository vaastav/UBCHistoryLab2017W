It baa .ten found impossible, thus far, to re
duce the t >rce In the southern state.* east of the
Mississippi which were engaged in the war of
reltellion. About one-siith of the army is still
located there. It iato be hoped that an im
proved condition of affairs In that section may
remit the withdrawal of a portion of the
forces.
The secretary renews the recommendation
that tlie extra lteutenaius now authorized by
law to -erre am regimental adjutants and qiiar
termaster* in the artillery. infantry and cav
?lry regiments be discontinued, a-< vacancies
occur in those grades. A yearly saving, with
no injury to the service, of nearly *100,100 would
thus be ejected.
Thorough inspections, especially in connec
tion wit.'i tho-e branches of the service having
charge of disbursement*. have been ordered,
and the insjector will be held responsible for
any defalcation or misapplication of the public
money or property which may oecur within the

our present needs; most are toe larce for tbe
economical and efficient distribution of onr
m all peace force, and almost all, built baatiiv
of unseasoned t.mber, bare bow fulfilled tbe
j easure of their ns^ful life.
To spend money in tbe constant endeavor to
keep these ships at! oat |> the most expensive
?ar of maintainrg a nary, sinoe constantly in
creasing expenditure if answered by c instantly
decreasing results of food. It would be the
wisest economy at once to afford tbe means and
tbe authority to build a number of small ac
tive cruisers, of lire oak or of iron, which,
adapted to tbe duties and tbe means of our
navy id time of peace, aud fitted with the mws
n.odern and economical machinery which has
succeeded that In use at the commencement of
the decade, could be maintained aad employed
r<* wme years, with com
para.ively littie expei se tor repairs.
He says wtbout new material our actlre
icrce on the several stations must rapidly de
crease until our cruising navy will, in a few
years, pass almost entirely awav. He next re.
views the work of the various fleets abroad. In
regard to the Interoceanic canal he sav*! The
present se? ms to be an opportune moment tor
us to take into serious consideration the repors
ot the surveys and explorations mvie upon the
tLi *n w'{h the view of solving, it
l>ossible, the engineering and commercial prob
lems involved, ^nd establishing water commu
nication between tbe two oceans. The Secre
tary speaks of the great advantages ot' such
canal, and recommends the exploration of every
part ot the isthmus, especially those nearer the
. nited states, since, though necessarily of
greater (length, they he more directly in the
pathway ot our commerce and development,
and t he mere obstacle of greater length ot canal
max be more than overcome, if it shall appear
that it can be constructed, without ene >uut?r
ing -orious engineering difficulties. Recent in
formation ta\ors the examination of tbe vailev
ot the river Bojaya.
ncxt refers to the cruise or Commander
K. \V. Meade among tbe island* ot the Sonth
-,.fc!flc known as ?he Na/igation islands.
J heir josition. in relation to New Zealand,
Australia, the Sandwich Islands, the ports of
South America, and the Isthmus, and to San
Francisco, makes it almost the necessary har
bor lor supplies, coaling, and repairs for all the
trade and travel westward to Australia and
southern Polynesia, or returning thence to tbe
shores of America. A* an available station for
coaling and supplies for our national and com
mercial marine in that part of the world, it is
tar tbe best to be found within a sweep of manv
thousand miles. *
He warmly urges tbat the opportunity thus
afloraed at least to protect, if not to encourage,
someof the American interest which are there
struggling to establish themselves be embraced.
The purchase of a building for the Hydro
graphic office is recommended. It is also recom
mended tbat experiments in steam boilers under
patronage of the government be made with toe
view to increased security to our naval and com
mercial marine. Legislation regulative of tbe
inspection and management or steam boilers
must necessarily be imperfect under an imper
fect knowledge of tbe causes which lead to
explosions; and reliable knowledge can never be
attained by silent reflection in the study, or by
verbal and theoretical disctE^ion. but only by
actual trials on real boilers, under sach condi
tions and circumstances as the present advanced
state ot engineering science and skill ahali die
tafe.
He renews his recommendation of last year
that our navy yards shall be developed and
adapted to the new necessities ot naval warfare.
I hey are the resources of naval power, and
I ke lortitications. if strong and capable, otten
rtettr other rations from lighUv entering upon
w ar with their possessors. At Mare Island es
pecially, he recommends the establishment of a
gi>at dock yard. It is rccomtnended that the
i-Lii adelpbia navy yard be carefully valued,
and a sum equal to its valuation appropriated
to convert I.cage Island info a tirst-class yard
tiie sum to be returned to the Treasury as soon
?a tl.e new works shall be sufficiently advanced
to warrant the disuse and sale of the o'd vard
lie recommends liberal appropriations for tha
> or folk yard, to re-establish and multiply its
resources.
He repeats the recommendations of his last
report in regard to the reduction of the num
ber of officers in the naval service, and the
manner ot tilling the higher grades; and refers
again to the suggestion there made tor in
creasing the time of ser vice for cadet-midship
men at the Naval Academy; and further sug
gests that, alter the abolition of the grtd^of
commodore iu the manner proposed, Congress
should, bj law, provide a certaiu amount of
actual sea-service to ie served bv an offl er in
each grade brforc he shall bo eligible, in time
of peace, tor promotion b> a higher one.
1 he appropriations made bv Congress for tha
tsca I year ending June 3ft, 1ST ;, were
.1 ??--, tbe actual expenditures for the sarue
Kriod. amounted to S17,6il,t>5.7G. This last
amount will of course Ihj increaasd by the dis
charge of existing contracts and liabilities
incurred in distant parts of th^ world, but it is
be leved that when all demamis upon the appro
priation shall have been s^-fled the actual
expenditures will still remain iiijre than -
'-'i less than tbe amount appropriated. The
af propriations for the current Usual year
amount in the whole to *.#,704.55*57 l'he
amount ot this appropriation drawn, up to the
r mo.nth' ?^.?5.573.07; this,
re duced by the amount remaining in the hands
of the various paymasters and agents of the
government, will leave ?0,0oft,000 as about the
amount actually expended fcom tha current
appropriations during the wording months of
the present tiscal year.
The estimates amount to S20:236,747 50, some
what larger than last year; but the increase will
be tound, on examination, to b<j almost wholly
owing to the imperative demands for improve
ments In our steam machinery. fbr several yean
past eked out by the use of old and (ometimes
imperfect materials.
In concluding his report, the Secretary refers
to the torjedo system, and says: o.ir separation
from tbe po.itical complications of Knrope pro
duces a security which has resulted in notorious
unreadiness to meet any sudden hostile emer
gency, which can come only from the sea
by an armed navy in proportion to oar strength
or to the extent of our roasts. A well-developed
system or torj-edo warfare would, to some ex
tent. possibly to a latge extent, meet this condi
tion ot unreadiness. Torpedo warfare Is still In
it- infarct; but It is tbe infancy of a most pow
?' ?^^tnient. and It Is especially the poU
cy ot the I nited States to foster its growth as a
w,e*I'OT- adapted to oursituatlon. The judgrasnt
ot the most careful and experienced officers in
our serv.ee is unanimous and strong in ravor of
the use or every means or enlarging and improv
rtlr TI ?." i J',?. torpedoes, and of provi
f ,he,r inTestigatioa and u?e.
It wooTd be a grave errcr, however, while advo
cating tho importance of torpedoes as one means
>.f at ack and defense, to forget that these will
not aione snffice tor naval purposes.
Men-ot-war add to tbe security of onr citi
zens in tortign countries, often semi-barbarous;
they give protection to our commerce against
illegal violence; they strengthen the hands of
diplomatists at hostile or half-civilized court*

The commis-ioner says rh%t the annual increase
in the tax on fermented liquors at *1 per barrel
in the last three year* as contrasted with the
stationary character or the receipts during the
four years next preceding, is certainly gratify
ing. but the increase durtcg the first three
months Of the present fiscal year far exceeds
that of any corresponding period in any other
year since the organization of the office. The
iiumber of persons engaged in the manufacture
of fermented liquors during the fl-?al year ended
June 30, lfc.2, was 3,421. Of theee it is s??own
bat 13 were in the l?i?trict of Columbia.
The commiseioner recommends that the lan
guage of the amendment* made by the act of
.tune C, 1S72. to section 59 of the act of July 2t,
ISC*, a* amended April 10. 1*.?, relating to the
special taxes tor selling epirituons and m tit
liquors and wines be made more explicit; alsj,
recommends that retail dealers in tna's liquors
l?e limited in th< ir sales to quantities less than
five gallons. and that those s Uing in quantities
of five gallons and upwards bo required to pay
the wholesale dealer's tax.
Tables are given showing an increase ii the
total receipts f rom the manufacture and sale of
tobacco in all its forms, over the receipts from
the same sources tor the preceding fiscal jear.
of $137,21.3-24; total product of manufactured
tobacco for the year 107,!f6d,84.-? poumls. The
number of cigars,"cheroots. &c.ton which taxes
were collected during the last fiscal year was
1,627.703.972. The entire product of manufac
tured toboc< o reported for the fiscal year ended
June 30,1S72, exceeds the totnf product of the
preceding year by 1,431 ,?92 pounds, while the
aggregate qnantity which reached taxation for
the last fiscal year was only 73,815 pounds In ex
cea? of the quantity which reached taxation the
preceding year. The collections for the first
quarter of tbe present fiscal year from tobacco
are greatly in excess of those made from the
sane source during the same quarter for any
previous fiscal year.
Tbe Commissioner says: "So tar as I am able
to judge, the law providing for a uniform rate
of tax on all manufactured tobacco, whether
chewing or smoking, is operating very satisfac
torily." He thinks that the uniform rate of 20
cents per pound will bring about as much reve
nue as the old rates; and after a review of the
present regulations in reference to tobacco, says:
'*1 advise that there be no additional legislation
on this subject at present."
The whole number of cases compromised, as
provided under section 102, act of July 20,1808,
during the fiscal vear ended .June 30, 1*72, was
4T!?. Total amount received by compromises,
S23?:,719 47; number of suits commenced, 6 311;
decided in favor of United States, 2,957; against
United States, 7*3; settled or dismissed. 2,408;
pending July 1,1872, 6,245; amount collected on
ju Ignunts. &c., $2,410,114 73; total value of
seizures, #?16,263.27.
A table exhibits a comparison of the receipts
lrom sources taxable daring the last two fiscal
years, not already presented in this report: The
ic.-rease on banks and backers is S9<$,!WS; on
gas, 42"S. <#6; and on adhesive stamps, *<54.Ml.
'Hie decreoee in the receipts of income from in
dividuals was f-6 >10,i#?.l. ?1,7*5,172 were, how
ever, o lset bv the increase in the returns from
corporations.'so that the balance shows a t >t?
decrease of only 54,725,789. The lirge apparent
la ling ofi in the receipts of income from indi
viduals is chiefly owing to a difference in the
rate of tax.
Tbe leceirts for the last fiscal y>ar exceeded
the commissioner's estimate by $3,770,946 73.
Important changes having beeii made in the
la-* by act of .June 6. 1872, touching spirits and
tobacco, it is impossible to state with certainty
at this early day how mui h the receipts tor the
curren* fiscal year will be affected by tUe modi
fied provisions of the law. From th > t> r i;i
tormat.on ro* obtainable, he esti.' ites that
thtv wdl not fall short under the { resent law of
$11 "',000,000.
Under the head of '-consolidation of districts,"
the Commissioner savs :_??'! lie act of June 8,
W2, rtquirc-d the reduction of tbe internal rev
nine districts in the United States to not ex
ceeding eighty in number, by uniting two or
mere districts Into one; and also the reduction
of the minor officers in the service to a^ small a
number as would be consistent with their lim
ited duties. * * * Inasmuch as the act only
provided absolutely for i'ie reduction of wme
two-thirds of the principal officers, 43") in all,)
and left the reduction "of the assistant* (ovor
1.3<0) discr'tionan/, it seemed to be the better
plan to ask Congress to make the larger reduc
tion, and make that absolute. * * * 1 have
bad prepared the outlines of a law which will
give effect to the above idea. This will l>e pre
sented to the proper committees of the House of
Kenresentativos and the Senate immediately
upon their assemblage in December proximo."
