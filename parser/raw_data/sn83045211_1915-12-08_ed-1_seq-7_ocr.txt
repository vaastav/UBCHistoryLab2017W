Sunday Public Ledger. It is a page- of suggestion, informa
tion and instruction. Next Sunday's page contains the open
ing chapter of a vigorous, manly story for boys "Walt True

"The Winter Birds," Boy Scouts ot America, Science and
Invention, Jack Horner's Corner, etc.
It is a page which will interest readers of those ages when,

dent Wilson contemplates Germany's
career of treachery and torture."
Tho Westminster Gazette Issues an
appeal, saying: 'We appeal to the Amer
ican people, that, If they nre unable to
Jielp us by positive assistance, not to
hinder us by asserting neutral rights of
commercial Interests to the prejudice of
our naval power."
The Globe, alone of all the London
newspapers, today professed to see possi
ble danger for other world powers In
I resident Wilson's demand on Congress
yeslortlny for Increases In the American
Army and Navy.
"It will strlko every one," said the
Globe, "ns significant, oven ominous, that
the message was so Insistent upon tho
necfsslty of adequate provision for na
tional defense." ,
Tho afternoon papers voiced editorial
approval of President Wilson's attack on
"hyphenates," but certain newspapers
took tho President to tnsk for remain
ing silent regarding Germany's alleged
policy of frlghtfulncss.
The Dally News .tnys' "t Is doubt
fill whether the Monroe Uoctrlne will
over bo tenable again, experience having
shown that the United States can no
longer rely on political Isolation rounded
on geographical detachment, which has
largely lost Its meaning."
The V)nlly Nowb argues that It Is only
the Urltlsh navy which today stands In
effective defense of tho Monroe Doctrine
and that "If Germany were victorious In
this wnr the United Stales' guarantees of
the lndcpoiitlpr.ee of the Stntes of South
American would not be worth the paper
oil which thnt doctrine Is written."
The Dally Chronicle says! "After the
amazing revelation of Ocrman machina

States tolerated tho present condition of
thlrgs much longer. It would be strnngo
It the American people did not Insist on
strong mensures to restore security .of

Tho President demands new laws so
ns to apply them In these mysterious
enscs; so that' suspicion. Insinuations
nnd denunciation may be given the
character of evidence for convictions.
And that Is a presidential message to
Congress! A docum6nt more Hhame
less than this Is not recorded In the
iinnnls of Ariierlcan history.
NKW YORK TIMES
Cunnrmlng and continuing the, tradi
tions of a century, the President's ad
dress to Congress rcllecls his and the
people's vision of thef great destiny of
tho nation nnd embodies him and their
sense of tho duty to erect safeguards
against perils without and within. No
message .or address to Congress since
that memorable utterance In which
President Monroo proclaimed the doc
trine which President Cleveland tnrc
quarters of a century .later declared to
bo "applicable to every stogo of our
national existence" has been exclusive
ly devoted to tho greater problems of
tho nation, tho problem of assuring Its
growth with peace, with safety nnd
with honor. Within the scope of tho
President's vision llo not merely the
Immediate and pressing questions of the
day, but those of coming nnd far off
years.
NEW YOItK WOULD
No other part of that 'addrcBs wns so
momentous as thoso paragraphs In
which the President nsserted thnt' "the
gravest threats against our peace and
safety have been uttered within our
own borders." To deal with this Issuo
of sedition Is thcbeglnmng of national
defense. Neither armies nor navies can
offer security to a .nation If Its own
population Is honeycombed with dis
loyalty, and If allegiance to tho Con
stitution Is a lying nnd fraudulent
allegiance.
NEW YOItK SUN
Even with the new light thnt has
como to his discerning vision, even with
tho consciousness of an approaching
presidential election In which an ob
stlnnto resistance to the will of tho peo
ple would mean certain political dls
aster.lt cannot have been an easy thing
for Mr. Wilson to have written the ad
mirable paragraphs urging provision
for a more adequate defense. Let tho
great credit that Is hts Just due for this
manly retraction be awarded to tho
President.
NEW YORK TRIBUNE
The now Wilson message holds out
little light o CongreBS or the country.

No mention Is made of modifications

In this remarkably interesting and instructive volume Mr.
James gives living glimpses of what America offers of anti
quarian, scenic, geologic and ethnologic interest. He shows
what the public is missing in not "seeing America first," and
claims that our scenic features' at least are more wonderful
and alluring than those of Europe. A splendid gift book.

TN the course of an excellent article on the influence of alcoholic
1 beverages on the human brain the Rochester Herald says:
'""TOTAL abstinence propagandists have placarded various
1 American cities with notices to the effect that 'science says'
that even moderate indulgence in alcohol retards thinking for
hours, and they sloganize their placards with 'safety first.'
ISjOW, our total abstinence friends are committing an act of
N intellectual dishonesty when they put out these placards,
because science does not say what they assert that it says. Of
course, certain men of science do, and if they were content to put
the matter thus, there would be no complaint to make, but in thei
desire to be impressive these total abstinence advocates declare
that 'science says' so, although there is no consensus among men
of science in reeard to what the effect of alcohol upon 'he human

to all but total abstainers that some persons seem to be able to do
better work after moderate indulgence in alcohol than without
such indulgence. Addison has come down to us in history as the
finest conversationalist of his time, but it is said that without the
gentle stimulus of wine he was quite unable to speak interestingly.
And one need have no hesitation in saying that if all the intellect
ual products of the world's total abstainers could be put into one
scale, and all the products of the world's drinking men could be
put into the other, we should be amazed at the meagerness of the
total abstainers' product."
FROM the above article it is once more clearly shown that it is
a FALLACY "to say that the moderate indulgence in alco
holic stimulants is a deterrant to intellectual endeavor. And the
best proof of this FALLACY is the FACT that many of the
world's greatest thinkers have been temperate users of alcoholic
beverages.
