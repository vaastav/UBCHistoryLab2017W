Senator Watson's Suggestions
The , Chicago New? has the following to say
about Senator Watson's, suggestions relative to
the revenue problem:
y' "On the many' recent utterances by influen
tial nemberi of congress respecting the solution
of .the -.revenue problem the most sensible are
tKbse p Senator, Watson of Indiana,' who appre
ciated; the 'necessity of immediate action by con
gress fox relief of the overburdened taxpayer as
welt "Saof .letiimate i business struggling with the
difficulties of readustment from a war to a peace
basis . ;
"The Indiana senator advocates repeal of the
excess profits taxes, but he does not stop there.
He; also favors: a reduction of the present, sur
taxes on the large incomes, a proposal which de
serves serious consideration from those. who
telieve in equity as a basic principle of taxation.
I ; "Finally, Senator Watson urges the-extension
; of the time for the payment of the war debt over
I a period of 60 years. It is to be hoped that in
this, as in the other proposals, he reflects a grow-
ing sentiment among congressional -leaders. The
treasury department has adhered stubbornly to
I its origjnal idea that the war debt ought to be
discharged within 25 years. Such a policy would
J be -unjust to the taxpayers and detrimental to
" business It would prevent any substantial re-
1 duction 'of the crippfing taxes imposed by the
j war revenue law.
2 "A sound policy of national economy and a
I due regard for the stability of national industry
; urge the extension of the time for the discharge
! of the war debt over the period suggested."

THE EXPENSIVE LUXURY.
My auto keeps me busted, my stand
off goes no more, in shops -where I
was trusted in happy days of yore.
"N'ay, nay," exclaims the grocer, when
for some prunes 1 go; "you've grown
too blooming slow, sir, in paying what
you owe. You blow for gas and rub
ber. th coin yoH-owe for rice, bo
:hase yourself, you lubber, ' or else
bring In the price." - My auto is a
daisy; It fairly burns 'the soil; but it
has made me lazy, l balk ' at honest
toil.. The old blue sheep needs shear
ing, I ought to bale some hay, but
here t am careering gome forty versts
away. ' . The kitchen should be paint
ed, the roof is gaping wide; but who
would get acquainted with work, when
he can ride? My wife is sorely need
ing '.some deecnt rags to wear, but.
I've been pinched for speeding and
have no coin to spare. My auto keeps
me ' busted, mechanics get my - wad ;
some ,bolts must be adjusted," some
carbon; must be thawed; she needs an
overhauling, which costs two hundred
beans, the while the kids are bawling
for bread and wholesome greens.
Ah, gee," the merchants mutter, when
I would buy some wood some codfish
or noine butter "your credit is no
good; and once," they say, embittered,
''like some bright twinkling star, your
credit glowed and' glittered before
you owned a car."

vhat he said was beyond criticism.

which we are ashamed. 'We make

that we feel sorry m our hearts, we

ception everywhere in the United States. It
refers to the enactment of legislation to provide
for immediate relief for the men who were dis
abled in the World war.
Congress will not ignore this recommenda
tion, for its members feel that the present sys
tem is not giving satisfactory results and are
convinced that remedial legislation is heeded at
once.
The time that elapses between the filing of a
claim for compensation and the final disposition
of the case is shamefully long, as a number of
disabled men in

One cannot blame the young men whose pro
ductive ability has been seriously impeded for
objecting to the manner in which their claims
are handled. '
They gave generously of their life and its
possibilities for the great ideal of democracy,
and now, with victory assured, they seemingly
are forgotten and their plight is unnoticed.
Congress cannot act too soon to remedy this
situation. Let it reorganize the department that
handles compensation claims, so that red tape is
eliminated and service men are rewarded "as they
deserve.
The Budget System
Undoubtedly congress will act again, on bud
get legislation. The bill, which President Wilson
vetoed because it contained provisions to which
he objected, was only the forerunner of legisla
tion that is sure to be enacted within a reason
ably short time.
It has taken the national legislators a long
time to see the advantages of applying to federal
Lbusiness those
tions have been using with success for many
years ; but the sincerity of congress on the meas
ure cannot be doubted now.
The adoption of a budget system will tend to
cut down unnecessary expenses and will enable
the government to approach its expenditures
from a scientifically sound viewpoint. The con
fusion of the old system will disappear. No
longer will one committee draft revenue meas
ures and another pass on appropriations, without
reference to actual facts.
good and kindness is much greater
than that for wrong and error and
one reason for this is that he gets so
much more for good than for evil. The
one who does wrong never feels com
fortable, whereas the one who does a
worthy thing at once is thrilled with
the desire to do a better one.
I like to think of my angels as very
human and loveable. I don't like to
think of their wings if they have any.
I like to think of them as the in
visible figures of my better self the
self that is "righteous altogether"
vital, strong, gentle, full of under
standing, not free to anger, wholly un
selfish, clean a working self.
Somehow or other, I always get very
near to discouraged folks because, I
guess, I have been there so many
times myself But still more because
I fancy that the angels are just a
little nearer them than anybody else.
And the big business of angels is to
inspire!
feo let's go on the side of the angels
as often as we can.
When Lincoln spoke those immortal
words "with malice toward none,
with charity for all," he walked over
and stood on the side of the angels.
And every time the business man feels
a human soul working with him in
stead of a mere employe, he too
associates with the ideals of angels.
We can all be so much better than
we are. Let us keep trying!

In a small town up-state there was
not one person who knew how to
play the organ at the church. At last
a girl who could play just a few, and
very few hymns at that, came to the
town. One day the preacher asked
the organist "Can you play a wedding
march for a wedding tomorrow?"
The organist replied: "I am very
sorry, but I do not know one note of a
wedding march."
The preacher knew that they must
have some kind of music for the wed
ding, so he said: . "Play the nearest
thing to a wedding march that you
know."
As the bride and bridegroom came
down the aisle, "Onward, Christian
Soldiers" was the tune that rolled
forth from the organ.

Itching Eczema
Dried Right Up
With Sulphur
Any breaking out of the skin, even
fiery, itching eczema, can be quickly
overcome by applying a little Mentho
Sulphur, says a noted skin specialist.
Because of its germ destroying proper
ties, this sulphur preparation instantly
brings ease from skin irritation,
soothes and heals the eczema right up
and leaves the skin clear and smooth.
It seldom fails to relieve the torment
and disfigurement. Sufferers from
fckin trouble should get a little jar
of Mentho-Sulphur from any good
druggist and use it like a cold cream.
