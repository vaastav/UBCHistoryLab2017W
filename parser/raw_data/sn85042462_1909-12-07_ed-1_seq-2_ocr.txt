CHICAGO, i>ec. 6. William O. I-e<\

RAILROAD TRAINMEN ARE
PREPARING FOR NATIONAL
STRIKE, IS THE REPORT
CHICAGO, Dec. B.—The Tribune this
morning says: "A national strike of
railroad employes became a more Im
minent peril yesterday. The develop
ments of the day bore out the forecast
given by the Tribune when it was an
nounced that the great army of men
working on the transportation lines of
the country had decided to back up
waga demands by striking If advances
were not granted.
"The Brotherhood of Railroad Train
men In New York prepared to present
to thirty-two eastern lines demands
for a 10 per cent increase in pay. flic
demands will bo presented to the rail
roads late this week. Vice President
James Munlock of the organization
Bald the men expected to win the fight.
"Bui if the railroads do not yield—
and their representatives have main
tained that, they would not—then, Mr.
MurdOCk said, there would be a strike.
The filing: of demands In the east will
bo. followed by the presentation of sim
ilar propositions In the west, with a
like ultimatum.
"The federal government Is awake to
the gravity of the situation. The of
flclals at Washington are keeping In
touch with developments and will be
prepared to take, a hand In negotia
tions to prevent a strike the moment
opportunity offers. They will act
under powers conferred by the Erdman
act."
NATIONAL OFFICERS MAKE
RULE THAT TRAINMEN MUST
NOT INTERFERE IN STRIKE
rr. PAUL, Minn., Dee. President
Bheperd of the Order of Railway Con
ductors arrived yesterday from Cedar
Rapids, lowa, and after a conference
with the four other national officers
here ordered out those members of the
conductors' organisation who, through
recent promotion by the Northern Pa
cific, have been acting as trainmasters
in charge of non-union switchmen.
The same action was taken today In
, ■■;;!,i to the Great Northern.
While the number of men bo employed
is only four In Minneapolis and about
seven in St. Paul, according to Secre
tary Parker of the strike committee,
the significance of the act is in the
principle involved, which prohibits
men of other railway organizations as
sisting in breaking the strike.
