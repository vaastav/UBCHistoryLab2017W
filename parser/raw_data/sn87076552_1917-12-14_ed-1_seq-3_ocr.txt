Where chestnuts nre plentiful one
may have
p mnny delightful dishes,
which give, both variety
find nutrition.

Soup. Shell H pint of
chestnuts, rover with
boiling water nnd boil n
minute or two to loosen
the brown skin, then dash
into cold water whtn
the skin will be rnslly removed. Add

THREE MEALS A DAY.
The conditions and prices all over
the land are brlngtng our housewives
to put more
thought and prep
aration on the food
'iVhriA for the family.
faVsfWfiJttfft Where the need is
iioL urgeiiK to De
economical the loy
alty of our women
will cause them to
use every effort to
save. The amount of food served In
hotels, restaurants, and In homes, has
been considerably lessened and with
out any feeling of dissatisfaction for
the men of the family realize that
their complaints will hinder the good
work,
In countless ways skim milk may
be used In place of whole milk, sav'
lng ju.t half the expense In milk. All
the valuable food materials are left
in milk with the exception of fat. A
teaspoonful of fat saved from the
meat platter or broiling pan will when
multiplied many times in the course
of n week, make fat enough to enrich
many dishes.
Maryland Chowder. Use equal
parts of canned corn and tomatoes,
if the quantities vary It Is still all
right. If the tomatoes are thick add
a little water, a tablespoonful of
minced onion or a little cold boiled
onion. Pare and slice thin then par
boil three potatoes. Add these to the
chowder and simmer until tender,
Lastly add a pinch of soda, a cupful
of hot milk, a tablespoonful of butter
nnd thicken with a tablespoonful of
cornstarch which has been rubbed
smooth In n little milk. Serve very
hot with crisp saltlnes.
Grapefruit Sld. Take a good
sized grapefruit, one head of crisp en
dive, wnicn nns neen snredded very
line. Take out the pulp of a grape
fruit saving all the Juice. Put all in
to a salad bowl with the endive and
dress with two tnblespoonfuls of oil
two teaspoonfuls of sugar, a half-tea-spoonful
of salt and a few. dashes of
red pepper. Toss and mix well add
ing more sensoning If needed. A dash
of vinegar may be needed If the grape
fruit Is very sweet.
' OuIJa Board.
-The so-called ouija board has no
more Intelligence than any other piece
of wood and Its movement or action
In the supposed answering of ques
tions Is controlled or Imparted to It
either 'Consciously or unconsciously,
innocently or fraudulently, voluntarily
or Involuntarily, by the operator. Tt
Is practically the same thing under n
new name as the planchette board,
which had' such a great run in the
early days of the spiritualism craze.
Exchange.
Adverbs.
Men may do many duties and yet do
none of them well, and consequently
do none at all In Ood's estimation,
jjllen may go the round of duty and
plod on In a course of religious per
formances, yet do nothing the while to
iany purpose. In all the duties of wor
ship It Is not the bare outward action,
ftat the manner of performance that
tives the denomination and is regard
led especially of the Lord. Hence Lu

account with Ood than verbs, meaning

The more common secret of want of
success In life is a tendency to let
things drift. It Is not so much the
missing one opportunity, or the com
mitting one blunder, as the lavish
waste of all forces opportunities
which In various shapes come within
the prasp. It Is the slovenliness .of
men and women which for the most
part makes their lives so unsatisfactory.
GOOD THINGS.
When making fudge and it is almost
ready to turn out, set the pan in hot
water to keep It
from hardening
and spread be
tween graham
crackers, put them
back In the box so
they will harden
in the right shape.

following: Ituh three cupfuls of prune
pilp through a colander, add a table
spoonful of gelatin dissolved In two
cupfuls of boiling water, sugar to
taste, a dash of lemon juice and one
cupful of whipped cream folded in.
Set In a cool place to harden and do
not put Into the cakes until it begins
to set. Do not throw away the wa
ter In which the hambone was cooked,
save It to flavor navy beans when
cooking lustead of water, the remain
der may be used to cook the cabbage
for some meal, giving it a fine sea
soning. Small bits of ham too small to bo
used In other ways, may be ground
and mixed with various seasonings;
mustard among them and used as
sandwich filling, or ndd to a white
sauce or to an omelet, not even a ta
blespoonful should be wasted.
Cauliflower With Onion Sauce.
Boil the cauliflower and place in a
dish which may be put Into the oven
and used as a serving dish. Add one
cupful of boiled onion, put through a
sieve, to a cupful of erearu, heat and
season with salt and pepper then stir
In the yolk of an egg well beaten.
Pour over the cauliflower, sprinkle
with fourth-inch cubes of bread
browned In butter and serve very hot.
Onions Stuffed With Sausage.- Par
boil good-sized onions until brown,
changing the water If the vegetable
Is very strong. Drain and remove the
centers, fill with pork sausage, round

GOOD THINGS OLD AND NEW.
For the meatless day try this
Nut Filled Potato. Bake until soft
and mealy six good sized
potatoes, prick them to
let out the steam then
cut In halves where they
were pricked. AVIth a
sharp spoon scoop out
the potato and turn it
into a warm mixing bowl,
mash and mix , with
cream, salt, butter, minced parsley, a
little poultry sensoning and a enpful of
nut meats that have been put through
the meat chopper; beat with a fork
until light and creamy then return
to the shells which after dusting with
buttered crumbs are placed in the
oven to brown. Serve with sprays of
parnley.
Harvard Salad. Dice sufficient crisp
celery to fill two large cups, adding
chopped radishes, six minced olives,
one small cupful of chopped nut meats,
two diced hard cooked eggs; blend
the Ingredients well, moisten with may
onnaise dressing and arrange in nests
of lettuce. Pour over a tablespoon
ful of the dressing, garnish with tri
angles of beets and grated egg yolk.
Nut arid Pecan Salad. Soak half a
pound of prunes overnight then cook
until tender and the liquid is all ab
sorbed. When the prunes are cold,
cut the flesh from the stones In length
wise slices, pour over these three ta
blespoonfuls of orange juice or any
canned fruit juice and set aside In a
cool place. Cut up a cupful of pecan
nut meat Into three or four pieces each,
add half a teaspoonful of salt, three
spoonfuls of olive oil and a tablespoon
ful and a half of lemon juice, pour
over the prunes and nuts; mix well
and add more seasoning if needed.
Serve on crisp leaves of lettuce with
roast of lamb.
Cheese Canapes. Cut slices from a
loaf of whole wheat bread, stamp in
circles, toasting to a golden brown,
butter lightly and spread with a cream
cheese which has been mashed to a
paste with salt, thick cream, half a

Cover the toast with this and garnish
each canape with rings cut from stuffed
olives.
Cleverness of Chinese.
It is acknowledged that the Chinese

NEWS REVIEW OF

President's Message Declaring
Americam War to Finish,
Hailed With Joy.
ADDS AUSTRIA TO OUR FOES
Progress of Russia's Efforts for Ar
mistice Germans Sacrifice Men
Recklessly in Furious Attacks
in France and Italy
American Troops to
Be Rushed Across,
By EDWARD W. P1CKARD.
The United States is in the war to
the finish and that finish must be the
overthrow of the Prussian military
despotism, the liberation and restora
tion of the peoples it has enslaved
and reparation for the material dam
age its armies have done. When thi
is assured, the United States will inr
sist on a peace that is based on gen
erosity and justice to all alike, ex
cluding all selfish claims to advantage
even on the part of the victors. Mean
while Austria-Hungary must be form
ally declared our foe in the war, and
"our present and immediate task" is
to win that war. i
Such in a few words is the message
of President Wilson to congress, to
America, and especially to the world.
He leaves no doubt of the govern
ment's and the nation's humanitarian
alms, and he makes equally plain the
determination never to make peace
with the present rulers of Germany
who have done such "deep and abom
inable wrong." The ' president ex
pressly disavows any intention to im
pair or rearrange the Austro-Hunga-rlan
empire, but says that to the
Austro-Hungarlans should be restored
Independent control of their own af
fairs, and avers that the Balkan states
and Turkey should be secured against
foreign oppression or Injustice. Mr.
Wilson's polished diction does not con
ceal his contempt for the pacifists, the
traitors and others who seek to ham
per the nation in the prosecution of
the war. When everyone else within
sound of his voice arose and cheered
the president's impassioned statements.
Senator La Follette, Representative
Mason and one or two more sulked si
lent In their seats. They are easily
classified.
Message Warmly Approved.
Instant approval of the message was
general throughout the United States,
and it received the hearty endorse
ment of the British and South Ameri
can press, though some of the London
papers, notably the Times, are skep
tical about the distinction the presi
dent still makes between the German
rulers nnd the German people. It must
be confessed a great many Americans
also feel the German people are not
so guiltless as Mr. Wilson represents
them.
Congress lost little time In starting
proceedings for formal declaration of
war against Austro-Hungary, and gov
ernment agents throughout the coun
try at once began preparing to handle
the million and a half enemy aliens
which It adds to the list. As tens of
thousands of Austro-Hungarians have
been employed in the mines of Amer
icn, there is danger of a serious short
age of mine labor. It Is likely a good
deal of discrimination will be used in
denling with su-h subjects of the dual
monarchy, as the Bohemians and vari
ous Slavic races, who have no sym
pathy with the autocracy of their
rulers.
Bolshevik! Peace 'Efforts.
The efforts of the Russian bolshe
viki to bring about a general cessation
of fighting was not markedly success
fill last week. Large numbers of Rus
sian troops were withdrawn from tin
front lines, nnd Austro-Huugary for
mally approved of the armistice plan
but when the representatives of
the Russians began discussion of de
tails with the Germans they met with
a quick check. Their first two stipu
Unions were that the enemy should
not undertake to send forces from
the Russian front to the front of Rus
sia's allies, and that the German de
tachments should be withdrawn from
ALLEGE EXCESS WAR PROFITS

Unrest among workers on war con
tracts because of the belief that the
firms are taking excess profits is re

the Islands of Moon sound. To this
the German delegates replied evasive
ly, merely promising to consult their
government.
On Thursday Berlin announced that
a suspension of hostilities along the
entire Russian front for ten clays be
ginning Friday noon had been arrang
ed. The same day Trotzky declared
the Russian government did not want
a separate peace.
There were reports, which, however,
were emphatically denied, that Rou
mania desired to open negotiations
for an armistice. If their flank on
the north were left unprotected by the
quitting of the Russians, the Rouman
an forces between the Dniester and
the Black sea would be in extreme
peril. Members of the Red Cross mis
sion of Roumania have just brought
to President Wilson a message from
King Ferdinand declaring his country
would never make a separate peace.
Ensign Krylenko is now in control
of much of the Russian array, his men
having captured the headquarters at
Mohilev and murdered General Duk
honin, former commander in chief.
At Inst reports General Kaledines'
Cossacks were marching on Vitebsk
and a battle with Krylenko's forces
was impending. Most of the Russian
diplomatic representatives in allied
countries and tiie Russian troops in
Frnnce have disowned the doings of
the bolsheviki leaders and refuse to
recognize their authority.
Germans Try Hard for Big Victory.
It is evident that the German high
command Is trying desperately to ob
tain a decisive military victory in
France or Italy, or both, before the
American army gets across in suffi
cient force to be effective. So far the
result achieved by the enemy has been
the gain of a few rods of ground at
an appalling cost in loss of life. The
fighting In the Cambrai sector devel
oped into the bloodiest and fiercest
battle of the war, and despite the
bringing up of great numbers of Ger
many's best troops, the British in the
main repulsed the repeated mass at
tacks and held most of the ground
gained the previous week. If Byng
can continue to hang on to his posi
tions, the battle will prove the best
thing the British could ask, for It has
brought the Germans "out of their
holes" and not only shown them up
ns inferior In open fighting, but cost
them an enormous number of their
most valuable men. The reckless sac
rifices made by Crown Prince Rup
precht contrast strangely with the In
formation that Germany is training
boys of fifteen and sixteen to take
their places soon In the fighting lines.
America has cause for pride and
satisfaction in the reports that come
of the part in the Cambrai fighting
taken by American engineers. Caught
by a sudden advance of the Germans,
these men took shelter until the Brit
ish came up to them, and then, borrow
ing guns, went into' the fray with a
gallantry and coolness that won high
praise from the commanding officers of
the British. A few of them were
killed and wounded, but the others
wrent right on with their fighting, pa
trolling and railroad building.
Fierce Fighting in Italy.
Along the Italian front the fighting
has been little less fierce than at Cam
brai. and as the week closed the'Aus-tro-Germnns
were making their sec
ond great offensive there. In the in
Itial attack by largely increased forces
the enemy compelled the Italians to
withdraw from some advanced posi
tions between Monte Tonderecar and
Monte Badenecche, but elsewhere the
violent assaults were repulsed. If
the invaders succeed in that sector in
flanking" the Piave and Brenta lines,
they might force General Diaz back as
far as the Adige. However, the Italian
commander seemed quite confident he
could prevent this, and his forces were
gallantly guarding the entire line
while increasing numbers of British
and French re-enforcements continued
to arrive. Among the allies in action
on this front are a number of Ameri
can aviators, and the declaration of
war against Austria-Hungary seems to
make sure the speedy dispatching of
a considerable force of American sol
diers to re-enforce the Italians. At
any rate that is what Italy expects
and the entire country celebrated joy
ously the news that its chief foe was
to be included in the enemies of the
United States.
U. S. Troops to Be Hurried Over,

The survey, which is being made

International organization was created
that will c--ordinate the utilization of
transport facilities, somewhat restrict
ing the imports of the various nations.
It may be that a considerable part of
the supplies for the American army
will be obtained from England and
France in order to save time.
The allies intend to bring out their
full man power, and the troops of the
United States are to be taken to the
front as quickly as it can be done.
There Is no doubt that this is the plan
of the government, despite the opinion
of Von Hindenburg and Von Luden
dorff that America was raising a great
army only to protect itself against Ja
pan and would not be so "foolish" as
to send it to Europe. If those gen
tlemen read the president's message
some glimmer of truth as to the real
determination of the United States
may penetrate their skulls.
China May Send an Army.
Before very long yet another na
tional army may be fighting beside the
allies in France against Germany. It
is reported that a large frce from
China is to be brought to the west
ern front, probably under the com
mand of General Yeng-Chang, chief
general adjutant to the Chinese presi
dent. For a long time many thou
sands of Chinese have been working
behind the lines in France, and doubt
less the well-trained and equipped
armed forces of the Oriental republic
also will be welcome there.
From Palestine General Allenby sent
word that he was in a position to en
ter Jerusalem at any time he saw fit,
but was continuing an enveloping
movement to the north of the Holy
City.
Equally satisfactory is the news
from East Africa, the British com
mander there reporting that the last
Germans had been cleared from that
vast region. All who were not killed
or captured had fled to Portuguese
territory, where they would soon be
attended to, he said. Thus Germany
has been stripped of the last of her
colonies. i
Interallied Naval Council.
An important decision of the coun
cil in Paris was to create an inter
allied naval council in order to close
contact and complete co-operation be
tween the navies of the allies. The
council will be composed of the min
isters of marine and admiralty chiefs
of the nations represented. The war
fare on the submarines is proceeding
satisfactorily, but the last British ad
miralty report shows the toll of the
U-Boats Is still high, 16 British ves
sels of more than 1,600 tons and five
others having been sunk in the week.
Among the boats torpedoed was the
steamer Apapa, 80 passengers and the
crew perishing. The submarine shell
ed the vessel's open boats that were
filled with women and children.
Early Thursday morning a fleet of
big German airplanes made a raid on
England and several of them succeed
ed in reaching London. Their bombs
killed seven persons. At least two of
the raiding machines were brought
down by gun fire and their crews cap

War Stamps on Sale.
The sale of war savings stamps
and certificates, America's newest
plan for raising war funds and encour
aging thrift, began on Monday, and
was taken up by the entire country
with an enthusiasm that presages its
complete success. The campaign will
continue for one year, and it is be
lieved the maximum sum authorized
$2,000,000,000 will be obtained with
out trouble.
The interstate commerce commission
having recommended the nationaliza

his aids took up the matter last week,
and Mr. Wilson was expected soon to

ceded that the roads must be given
liberal financial aid and a plan may be
evolved for their operation under a
government director of transportation.

By WILLIAM A. RADFORD.
Some of the buildings on the aver
age farm, as a matter of economy in
original investment and also in labor
cost of doing certain parts of the farm
work, may be designed to serve a mul
tiple purpose. Of the possible combi
nation buildings, perhaps the most log
ical is the combined ice house and
milk house. The appearance of the
farm is very much benefited by having
a smaller number of high-grade build
ings of somewhat larger size. A large
number of scattered outbuildings not
only result iu the appearance of dis
organization, but this arrangement
very of tn actually results in the waste
of miles of walking between buildings,
when the matter is considered on a
basis of a year's time. Even though
the combination building be, in real
ity, two separate buildings under one
roof or two departments having no
"
y,

connecting areuwavs or passages, the
result of the cohibinaton is the same,
if the selection of the parts of the
combination is carefully made.
The ice house and the milk house
must, of necessity, be definitely sepa
rated by a wall well insulated against
variations in temperature, yet a good
proportion of the contents of the ice
bouse will eventually be used in the
cailk room and the combination of
these buildings results in a saving of
time in filling the bunker or in obtain
ing ice for other purposes In the milk
house part of the building. Good dairy
men will not keep milk near the
stables, even though the law in their
state does not force them to observe
this precaution. The milk house is
then a necessity and it will ordinarily
be obtained in one of three ways: In
case the dairy business is large, a sep
arate building, fitted with all of the
modern equipment necessary to the
conduct of a paying dairy business,
will be needed. In case the amount of

Floor Plan.
milk handled is not great enough to
warrant the use of a separate building,
the milk house must be combined with
either the farmhouse or the ice house.
Under certain conditions, the farmer
might desire an extension to his house
which would include both , the ice
house and the milk house. A farm
house designed in this way is among
others in a group of designs recently
prepared by the United States depart
ment of agriculture. If such a scheme
is not used, the combined building
should, at least, be placed as near the
farmhouse as possible.
There are certain conditions which
must be taken Into account in building
the ice house. The first is that its lo
cation must be such that good drain
age is possible. There is always a loss
by melting and the water must be car-
1 ried well away from the building and
disposed of either In the soil, through

construction of the walls and roof or
the building to secure sufficient in
sulation to prevent undue loss. Struc
tural tile has been found an excellent
material for the construction of farm
ice houses. Its ordinary use provides
a series of dead air spaces which are
very effective as an insulation against
temperature vuriation. It is, of course,
necessary to use care in the construc
tion of the walls so that no leaks are
present to admit warm air to the in
terior of the house. The inside of the
house must be lined with some water
proofed insulation so that moisture

house there may be a partition placet
near one end to form a milk room anc
ice bunker. Such an arrangement is
more economical of ice than to build
the milk room in some part of the milk
house remote from the ice house. The
door into the milk room should b
constructed in the same manner as the
continuous doors placed Ir. the outside
wall of the ice house.
The milk house size and arrange
ment will depend upon the method of
handling the milk. If special equip
ment is used, provision must be made
for it in the house. There is more to
be considered than simply the size.
For instance, the farmer who wishes a
gasoline engine in his milk house, to
turn the separator, churn, ice cream
freezer or whatever other equipment
is used requiring power, must have
provision for the placing of a concrete
base, at the time of pouring the foun
dation and floor, and an outlet must be
provided in the wall or roof for the ex
haust pipe of the engine. If a boiler
is required, it may be necessary to pro
vide special floor construction for it.
In any event, the milk house should be
provided with a chimney and a cooling
tank should be conveniently placed,
in the design. Unless a supply of pure
water is near at hand end can be con
veniently piped to the milk house, It Is
advisable to place a pump in the milk
house. Some farmers place the equip
ment of their water supply system for
the farm in their dairy house. The
washing of cans and milking utensils
requires a small sink which should
be placed Where there is plenty of
light.
The combined ice house and dairy
shown in the accompanying perspective.
and floor plan is a well-designed build
ing of very neat appearance. The walls
of the building are of structural tile,
built upon a concrete foundation. The
ice is intended to be covered with saw
dust or straw that has been put
through the cutting box. Continuous
doors for easy filling extend from the
concrete wall almost to the peak of
the building.

orator and the nkimmed milk fed to
well-bred young stock as quickly as
possible after being separated. One
of the easiest and best ways of start
ing a farm dairy business is to handle
the milk in this way. The cream should
be sent either to the city or to the
creamery. Skimmed milk when fed to
pure-bred calves and pigs has a spe
cial value that brings better returns
than selling the milk. There is very
little fertility carried away Trom the
farai in cream cans. Farmers who do
a careful dairy business have valuable
stock and get high prices for the ani
mals fed in this way. The value of
the dairy house can only be measured
by taking into account all of the vari
ous features of the business such as
this method of feeding suggests.
Island of Santo Domingo.
It is incorrect to apply to the entire
island the name of Haiti, as that was
merely the aboriginal name for the
western section (the present repub
lic). The island should properly be
called either Santo Domingo, by which
it has been known for the greater
part of the four centuries of the two
names, Haiti-Santo Domingo. Another
mistake that is made frequently is to
refer to this republic as Santo Domin
go. While the island may be properly
called Santo Domingo, the correct
name of the country is the Dominican
Republic. Santo Domingo is not the
name of a country, but of the capital
and largest city of the Dominican re
public. This island is also frequently
confused with the island of Dominica
The latter is a small British island in
the lesser Antilles, about .350 miles
southeast of Puerto EIco, between the
French islands of Guadelope and Mar
tinique. As this island was discovered
by Columbus on Sunday he called it
Dominica.

The scene is a crowded bus. A sol

a corner near the entrance, put his
hand into his pocket for his fare, and
pulls out a shilling and some coppers.
The bus jolts violently and, to the sol
dier's dismay, the shilling slips from
his fingers just as the lights go out, as
they always do in London, in these

The passengers with one accord begin
