H. G. COTTLE, Editor.
We are authorize to announce
JOHN W. COFFEE,
I Morgan county, as a candidate for thi
' democratic nomination for Congress fron
the Ninth Congressional district, subjec
to the action 'of the democratic primary.
The mail order liquor houses
will reat a rich harvest for the
next few weeks.
Now is the season when the
young men are seeking a pretext
for auarrelinc with' their best
girls.
Santa Claus is almost as popu
lar with the little fellows as
Beckham is with the Kentucky
democratic voters.
The spirit of the mountain ed
itors toward the reviving of the
Mountain Press Association is
encouraging, but no action is be
ing taken. Brothers, don't it
look as though our business
methods are strongly reflected in
our apathy toward this? Let's
wake up and hustle!
We hope that the new. county
administration will catch the
good roads enthusiasm that is
taking hold of the other sections
of the State. Morgan county
only needs good roads to make
her the greatest county in the
mountains. Citizens, is it worth
the effort. Start the agitation
and keep it up until we have
good roads.
Notwithstanding the fact that
the law requires that the finan
cial statement of the county be
published annually, in the last
three years it has only been pub
lished once, and then only a list
of the claims , allowed. The
meaning of the law is that such
a statement shall be, published
as win snow an lae revenue ae
Tived from all sources and all
the expenditures. A statement
that will tell the public the exact
condition of the business of the
county the revenue received,
the money paid out and the in
' debtedness of the county.
THE NEXT LEGISLATURE.
Meeting just after the holi
days, with the evidences of the
enormous amount of liquor ship-
ped into Kentucky from other
states fresh in mind, it ought to
be an easy matter for the Gen
eral Assembly to enact a law
in compliance with the national
law known as the Webb bill,
that will prevent the shipment
of liquor into dry territory.. And
that such a law will be enacted
there is little doubt.. The senti
ment of the people is in favor of
it,- and the only opposition will
come from the liquor interests,
It will be a time when, the peo
pie will watch the votes of their
senators and representatives
closely in this matter, and few
will dare heed the call of whisky
trust. None of them want to
commit political suicide.
WANAMAKER AUD ADVERTIS
ING,
The Courier-Journal had the
following editorial in a recent is
sue concerning John Wanamaker,
Philadelphia's Merchant Prince
and former Postmaster of the
Tnited States. It could be read
with profit by every merchant in
Kentucky and we commend it to
the careful perusal of the mer
chants of Morgan county:
In an address delivered in
Philadelphia recently John Wan
amaker said the first necessity
of success in retail trade is good
merchandise, He added that
good advertising is "quite as
much of a necessity to a business
that is to keep up a healthy
growth." .
"If you have in your shop,"
said Mr. Wanamaker, "exactly
what 500,000 people in the city
want, but only , 500 of them
know you have it. the care and
energy you have expended in
maintaining a stock of high
quality will do little good, either
to your customers or to your
basiness."
Mr. Wanamaker may be con
sidered an authority on adver
tising, for there has been no
more consistent and persistent
adveitiserin all the history of
the United States. He is one
of the country's greatest mer
chants. He began business on
a rather meager basis, but by
judicious use of the newspapers
he let all Phildelphia know what
he had to sell, and increased his
establishment and his outlay
forpublicty nntil he made the
name Wanamaker known around
the world.
In the half a century or more
that the Wanamaker store has
grown from nothingness to its
present proportions thousands of
stores in Philadelphia have come
and gone without leaving a rip
ple on the city's surface. Hon
est merchants, many of them,
who dealt in good goods and
gave their customers a square
deal, but they either neglected
the publicity end of the business
or botched it up so badly that
they they got no results. "The
satisfaction of knowing that
your name stands for hood mer
chandise," said Mr. Wanamaker
in his recent address, "is
great thing certainly, Put it is
not ap.t to be greatly profitable
unless the public at large knows
it also:"
The retail merchant who does
not advertise cannot hope to
build up a big, growing and en
during business. All merchants,
it is true, cannot be Wanamak
ers, but. there is no merchani
who cannot enlarge his trade by
intelligent advertising.
it will command a monoply of
the saloon advertising and ob
tain a circulation among the li
quor people. L. T. H,
AND STILL THEY COME.
A few days ago we received a
volunminous unsigned article
boosting a certain candidate for
district office. It seems super
fluous to repeat that we publish
no unsigned articles. We have
said this so often that it sounds
stale, but still they come. We
don't know who our anonymous
eorrespondent is, but we feel
sure that he is not a subscriber
to the Courier or he would have
known better. He subscribes
himself "Democrat" at the end
of his,, effusion, but then there
are as many democrats in Mor
gan county as there" are Smiths
ki New York, and tnat signature
is not sufficient to sucure publication.
But then there is no great
harm done our waste basket is
of goodly proportions.
GOT HIS QUIEUS.
Sheriff Frank Kenniard last
week settled with the Auditor of
ublic Accounts and paid over to
him the amount of Revenue due
the State from Morgan county.
Mr. Kenniard was the fourth
sheriff in the State to meet his
obligations to the State. The
prompt and efficient manner in
which Frank Kenniard has per
formed the duties of the office
has endeared him to the people,
and if he ever asks for office he
will be a hard man to beat,

THE MESSAGE.
President Wilson has again
demonstrated that he is a states
man. His message to Congress
is a brief, but forceful docu
ment. It is not a preachment.
It is a terse explanation of the
'situation and a statement of his
views upon public questions.
His recommendation of Presi
dential primaries and of public
ownership of . the Alaskan rail
ways are regarded as extreme
by some, but they only show
that the President has looked in
to the future further than most
men do, and knows the actual
needs of the country. He advo
cates no change in the Mexican
question, but advised a continua
tion of the "watching and wait
ing" policy. He is demonstrat
ing that as the country becomes
ready for a departure from old
ways that he is ready to aid.
His administration will work the
greatest advancement of politi
cal and economic thought in our
history.
NEW PAPER.
The Kentuckian is the name
of a new monthly paper at Jack
son, by Ryland C. Musick, form
er owner of the Times. The pa
per has no local features but wil
seek a Statewide recognition
Mr. Musick has not yet decided
that Jackson is big enough for
him, and is considering the ad
visability of making the office o;
publication at Lexington or
Louisville."
it his Did ior statewide sup
port is founded on his antagonism
to the candidacy of Mr. Beckham
as the first issue indicates, his
venture will die a bornin'. An
other feature is that is printed
by contract away from home
and the union label is conspic
uously absent.
To clean the Augean stables
or pontics is quite a tasK, and
Mr. Musick is not a Hercules,
Cleaner politics is making great
headway in this State by reason
of the awakening of public con
science, and not by the efforts o
those who oppose Mr. Beckham
That crowd don't want clean
politics. If the lventuckian is
established to become the Moses
to lead the State to clean politics
it has gotten into damned bad
company at the very beginning
of its existence.
But we welcome the Ken
tuckian to our table, and give it
the glad . hand. It can't do
much harm, It certainly can't
hurt Mr, Beckham. Its editor
is one of those political genuises
who can always be depended up-
jon to snatch defeat from vic
tory, and who has never yet
backed a winner. If the pacer
'continues rabidly anti-Beckham

Want To Be a Spug?
The "Spug" movement is the
atest thing to call for public at
tention, and it has the merit of
being founded on good, hard
common sense. It is an associa
tion called 4he Society for the
revention' of . Useless Giving,
the term "Spug" being derived
from the,. first letters of the
words. -I don't know who start
ed the movement, but whoever
it was haearned a place in the
:Iall of Fame.
Useless, or ' rather senseles?,
giving needs to be abated. Take
the Christmas holiday giving for
instance. Jones buys Smith and
Brown and Green and Black each
a costly present, neither of which
he can afford and which are of
no practical use, just because he
feels that each of them will give
him some costly present that he
has no earthly use for. And be
cause it is a silly custom we have
not the courage to suggest that
we quit it lest some of our neigh
bors call us stingy.' The purpose
of the Spugs is to break up this
worse than silly habit. ' But the
Spugs don't discourage giving if
the gift will be helpful it is only
the useless giving that they wish
to abate.
Just what rules and reglations
the society has and what the of
ficers are called I don't know,
but the chief officer should be
dubbed the "Mighty Fool Kill
er," and should have a number
of assistants. I ''jined" as soon
as I could. Let us hope that the
Spugs will, wax numerous and
the giving for' mere form's sake
win cease. '. ' rarents and near
relatives should be as liberal in
their gifts as their means will al
low and the needy should not be
forgotten, but- useless ' gifts to
those who don't need them should
be eschewed'.
, vt CQurs&the young men are
expected to give their sweet
hearts something nice at Christ
mas time, ' but even then the
matrimonially inclined fellows,
snch as Daniel Henry ,and Leoni
das Redwine, should see that the
presents should be something
useful. Handsome men like my
self who just can.t help having a
half dozen sweethearts at a time
are not expe'i-ted to give Christ
mas presents as they might make
a difference between them.
. ASKED AND ANSWERED.
Am engaged to a young, man
and he insists on kissing me. Is
it right for me to kiss him ?
' , ! i Pretty.
If the man is in earnest there
is no particular harm in kissing,
but men are such liars that you
never know when -' they are in
earnest until you get them hog-
tied with a marriage ceremony.
What is "Platonic love?." '
Student.
Son, stick to , your Latin and
Greek, and if these do not fully
occupy your inquring mind try
something easy like the Fourth
Dimension, but let that subject
alone. I could answer your ques
tion, f course, but there .are
some things that the average
man should not know.. History
is replete with facts that only a
few men, like Joseph and my
self, can stand the moral strain
of Platonic love . I fear that yon
are not sufficiently hardened in
uprightness to discuss this.
How long should a man go
with a girl he loves before he
proposes marriage to her?
. Bashful.
There is ' no settled rules in
these matters. It depends in a
great measure upon the parties,
and upon the dilligenco of tho
lover. I do not recall, now, more
than a few instances when I pro
posed the first time I was with
the girl, and only then after sev
eral hours acquaintance. Mar
riage is a serious proposition and
should not be rushed into with
headlong speed, and it is not, as
a rule, a good idea to marry un
til the couple has been acquaint
ed at least two or three weeks.
