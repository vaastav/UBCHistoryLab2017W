Who had been addressed.
The next morning Frank Hamilton woke
with a duli turn in ha left aide that bronchi
hack the night before when he had been
eangbt between the cars in the switchyard. :
He remembered the face of the night nurse,
a pale face with dark eyes and iramed
keavily with the duskiest of tresses. The
is; curse was a little slip of a blonde who
slipped around m the corridors and halia
of the hospital aa unobtrusively as a mouse.
Hamilton waa of pood family, but was
"down on ha .fuck" from rash speculation,
and had accepted a job hi the railroad yards
rather than write home far money. He
was of an impulsive nature, and rathe
emotional and hopeful than a man able
to stand steadDy up against misfortune.
He waited curiously for the night nurse
to make her appearance. Presently she
came, and he noted that she took no more
interest m him than she seemed to take
is an old man who lay in the sane room
with him. Her attitude and cemeanor
were strictly professional, very calm and
self-possessed, and she looked snd remind
ed him somehow of a serene and fair lily.
"How badly am I hurtf he asked her.
TSot seriously, she replied. '4lts merely
a shock and a bruise, no bones broken."
"How ions will it be before I am well!"
W returned.
"If nothing happens,' she responded, ir
a week or ten daya."
"What could happen?" he inquired.
Tever for one thing," she replied. "AL
that is necessary for yon to do is te keep
flu irt and not worry.'
"That tiupht to be easy enough,' lie an
swered; "lew people worry, do they V
"Kot if they care to get well."
It yon like this work?" he ventured.
"Yon are Terr ia-guiait ive and presume
an your hurts, was the girl's reply. "If
1 didn't like it I would not be here."
'Isn't it pretty hard for a woman to he
here with, what do they esS them, emer
gencies coming in night end day?"
"It 1s hard and disagreeable often, the
answer came, "but it is hardest on the
people who are hurt and those who depend
on them for support."
She gave him the drops the doctor had
ordered, told him brusquely to go to sleep,
and presently he did an, half lulle by the
stillness which seemed to fall over the nar
row streets xmtside when night fell 2n
the morning the little blonde nurse came
on duty, and Hamilton began his daily task
of trying to be cheerful.
When the long, long afternoon liersn to
wane, Hamilton found himself waiting
eagerly for the pale-faced girl who had
first welcomed him to Doubting: Castle, as
he had christened the hospital. As the
twilight crept in and began to darken the
alley he felt an uplifting of the spirit. At
the sudden flare of the street lamp, he
sensed her coming, and when at last she
stepped into the dingy little room, it waa
as if the space had burst into blossom.
Lady Disdain, he called her ia bis
thoughts after the first few nights.
"Yon are not getting along as well as yaa
should," she warned him on the fifth even
ing. "Well, that iast my fault, is it?" he in
quired. T don't know positively," the nurse re
plied, "but the day girl soys you are
fidgetty."
"1 may he a trifle uneasy in the daytime,
Tout you don't have any trouble with me,
do ynoT" he asked.
Kt! Ton seem to be fairly reasonable."
"I may turn nut to be very unreasona
ble when I get well," was his answer.
"Well, there will be time enough to think
about thai when the time comes far yon te
"X am going to take yon with me when
2 leave," he said.
Her lace darkened into a frown. "Ton
mustn't joke, Talr. Hamilton," she said,
. coldly.
"I'm not joking," he said, earnestly.
"Win you ttane with me when 1 get out
of this hole? Ko, I beg your pardon far
finding fault, they you have all been very
kind and good to me here."
"Then if we have, if I have, please don't
say anything like that again."
"Jast as you say,' he answered. The days
snd nights passed on. and what with fever,
and complications, Frank Hamilton was
ever six weeks in the hospital before be
was entirely well. Hit conversations with
the night nurse had resumed the old friend
ly tone, but he had never given up his
resolve la make her bis wife. The day he
left he asked her to marry him, after giv
ing h briefly his history.
It was a hard position for the girl, and
she told him that she was sorry that he
really ielt serious about it.
"1 an to lie married when I graduate,
she told him, "and am only waiting fm
that."
"Is there no possibility of anything hap
pen ing to change your mind?" be asked.
"Sulking at all, was the reply, "bul
I am sorry, Mr. Hamilton. But you will
not remember it long. It seems to be nat
ural sickness far men to fancy they
are ia love with their nurses I don't want
to be cynical, bet you wiD be happy is
the way it has turned out a year from now."
HamHtoa went to the yards and drew
the money coming te him. Then be took a
ride down to the city and made a par
chase. Ertnruing to the yards, be borrowed
a pen and ink and wrote a letter. Ht
took the letter and dropped it into a street
box, drew a revolver, placed it to his breast
and fixed, fie fell sot a block away frost
