LAUSANNE, Dee 8.--I:
I to-day presented to the eont
I hare Turkey's countor-propos?l for ta?
! rrirulation of the Straits. The new

| also is prepared to renounce hta as?
i tremist demand for absoluta closing of
the Straits t<? warships and is using
! diplomacy rather th?n the iron list ana
the rat 'ing tcnbbnrd, was increasingly
evident.
At tic nftrrnoon session Marquis
I Curzon took up the contentions of
Ismet, expressing thn opinion tl
'most points It seemed possible to h?r
'nioni-.e the Turkish demand.? with the
Sroposnls laid down by th? Alll?
ay? ?go. Most r.f the points of differ.
ence, he said, wero matter, for In
'ormal ?djustmont by militn
naval experts. The only item
.ound ?nv msterinl obstruction en tlie
1 Ulled ?Ida was the demand for Turkish
sovereignty over th.
! the western entrance of the Darda

I territories withm '-he Strait? ai

This is the most impnrti.nt pbaae
of the entire Turkish program/ ??? it

Ready to Police Tree Seas
"No nation has gone further than
i the United States in the policy of naval
disarmament," Child declare'). "Hut
no nation would be readier to uphold
tha good sense of maintaining suffi?
cient naval forces to act as po :
the free seas, to protect its citizens
and their ship? wherever they may be,
to ?uppre.? piracy and other menace?,
to act at all times for the public
?. ind to giva relief to the srsffaring,
ust as ships of war acted .??ently in
th? Near East. Shir*? of war aro not
t.eeeasarily agents of destruction."
The Hussian dcli-gr.tion lo-nir-ht
madd a final effort to force ratty to
the ?mailer discus? on?., which the
Allie? have repeatedly ret used then. A
statement circulated fi | head?
quarters said that while th
I was in general accord
I declaration, they reacrved Baal decision
Ion the detail? of the plan fur th- rila?
I armament of the Straits pcadiag **cl?.??
! exam nation of these in subcommissions
J of experts, where the rieht to sah ex
] planations and specificati ^ns is rcjerved
' by the Russian delegation."
The Tarka, however, pricked un their
ears at one point of the Allied declara?
tion, when Marquis Curzon paaaed over
their demand for tho eataMishment of
naval arsenal? in Constantinople, say?
ing that all such subject! would be
dealt with in the naval and military
clauses of the treaty, which, he hoped,
would be ready t<n Ji eussion in the
next few ?I-.y?. This was a surprise
to the Tuns, who were eagerly de?
manding further infermation on these
military and naval features. Their
understanding has been that then
would be no discussing here of c
down the Turkish ujaay, ?r.d on t*- is
point the Angora j\\wirnb\y ha.? in?
structed its delegation not to nejro
tlate any way.
The Tribune is able to state that tho
Allies will present the military and
naval clauses for discussion by com
possibly to-morrow, and that
they are ready to agree to inainionanc-? j
of the Turkish army at its present
??trer.gth. They will appeal, however,
to the common sense and peaceful
spirit of the Ottoman government to
