COXGKKSS AT WORK
Statesmen of the Xatloa Meet at the
Capitol
Washington Deo 4 It la expected
that the house will be occupied with
important business this week
At the very threshold of the session -will
come the contest over the ad
mission ot Representative elect Rob
erts of Utah and later In the week the
house will plunge Into an Important
and possibly a protracted debate upon
the financial bill which was prepared
by the Republican leaders last spring
at Atlantic Ciy
The Roberts case has attracted the
attention of the whole country The
Republican leaders have adopted a
plan of procedure which la designed
to prevent Mr Roberts from taking
the oath of office until after the
charges in connection with his alleged
polygamous practices have been inves
tigated by a special committee
In the Senate
Washington Dec 4 The first week
in the senate will probably be marked
by considerable lethargy Indeed It
would be exceptional It any actual
work would be done On Monday the
new senators will be sworn in but
beyond this nothing will be done Or
dinarily the presidents message is re
ceived on the first day of the session
but its receipt will be postponed tor
a day this session out of respect to the
memory ot the late Vice President Ho
bart whose death Senator Sewell will
announce Tuesday little will be done
beyond the receipts of the annual mes
sage the present purpose being to ad
journ immediately after the reading of
the message to give the Republican
senators an opportunity to hold a
caucus over the reorganisation ot the
commltteefl Up to date only one sen
atorial appointment has been made
This is the case of Senator Quay but
if he is seated there will be an effort
to fill the vacant seats from Utah Cal
ifornia and Delaware by the same
methods There is unusual interest in
Mr Quays case and both his friend
and opposing senators are already
working cealously Mr Quay will make
no effort to be seated Monday
Brooklyn Police Censured
New York Nor 80 The Kings
county grand Jury In a presentment

ment had tbe polios been more active

He Says Democrats Will Make Orsas
Galas Next Year
Galveston Tex Dec 4 In speaking
of next years campaign Hon W J
Bryan who Is the guest of ex-Governor
Hogg was hopeful for Democratic
success
Mr Bryan states that the Democrats
will make great gains next year
among large classes Of people These
people comprise the wage earners
said he Those who have been direct
ly affected by the consolidation of the
great manufacturing and produoting
concerns of the country commonly
called trusts In this class is enume
rated day laborers offlcemen drum
men etc These are the peoplo who
will rote with the Democrats next
year
With a continuation of such an in
crease to our side for the next 12
Tfl
months it will not be a question of i
whether or not the Democrats can win
but how Urge the majority will be I
have no fear for the outcome The re
cent elections to an unbiased mind
plainly Indicate that the Democrats
had the better of It in nearly all the
states in which elections were held In
Ohio Mr McKinleys home state is
the Democratic gain more clearly
shown than anywhere else except in
Maryland an Nebraska The vote giv
en Jones was anti Republican and
had he not been in the race It most
assuredly would have gone to Mc
Lean Next year with the present
tlo of increase Ohio will go Demo-
cratic by a safe majority
The Republicans would like to cov
er me with the glory of personally
winning the fight in Nebraska They
would it possible lead the people
to believe that there would be no is
sues in this election and that 1 was so
personally magnetic as to lead the
people to the polls with nothing more
than myself as an incentive The truth
of the matter is the people of Nebras
ka have beau awakened
They realise that it is time that a
change was being made In the admin
istration of affairs of the government
and they propose to throw off the yoke
of a single standard a militarism and
to cheek the avarice and greed that
has almost bacons the objective of
that party And not only in Nebraska
is this the oase hut I find that from
both personal Investigation and from
those who are In a position to know
that the people in many sections of
other states heretofore strongly Re
publican have made up their minds to
Join the free sUves forces next year
Republican Financial BUI
Washington Mot The financial
bill of the Republican caucus com
mittee has been made public It pro
vides for a gold standard pure and
simple but proposes to use silver as
a subsidiary otto It creates a division
ot Issue and redemption In the treas
ury department It proposes to protect
tbe gold reserve fund of not leas than
50000000 by authorising the secre
tary ot the treasury to Issue bonds
and by doing away with the endless
chain schema of drawing out gold
with greenback It enlarges tbe facil
ities ot national banks allowing them
i to issue notes to the par value of
United States bonds deposited sad
also permits the organisation of
tlonal banks in small places with 16
000 capital stock as a minimum
I Will Furnish a Bond
Indianapolis Ind Dec 4 President
Mlchsll of the United Mine Workers
of America said the organisation
would put up any amount ot bond re
quired for the release of the national
organiser Kelly who was arrested at
Springfield Hi He said that habeas
corpus proceedings had been Instituted
for the release ot National Executive
Committeeman Reese and ha believed
his release would be secured soon by
this mn
ravin
Speaking of thrift said the promi
nent clergyman I remember one man
who waa as good an example of
shrewdness ss I have evr seen It
was when I began preaching that
met Ij tm I was young and struggling
my salary was small and the man waa
a member of my church He usd to do
work on a scroll saw and one of his
specialties was a sort of plant stand
wltb two shelves and with scroll work
ornameutstloa Two or three times he
tried to sell me one but as 1 had no
need or use for it 1 told nun so
The time for fcn annual doatfoo
perjty drew near whan everything that
was girt counted toward that limited
satasy I was not altogether pleased
therefore wbeS the man with a plain
stand appeared at the dooi

BLOODY BATTLE AT MODDER RIVER
Although the Report of the Fall of
Lndysmlth Is Discredited at Lon
don the Ptoile Are Warned to
Nerve Themselves For the Worst j
PoMible Result
London Nov 30 At Leicester
speaking to a crowd of 7000 people
Joseph Chamberlain devoted the great
er part ot a long speech to a Justifica
tion of the governments policy in
South Africa and to a refutation of
the arguments ot the Karl of Kim
berlcy Sir Henry Campbell-Banner-man
and others According to Sir
Henry Campbell Bannerman said
Mr Chamberlain we ought to have
skulked back to our holes when Mr
Krugcr refused to listen to our peace
ful representations That would have
lost us South Africa weakened our
hold upon India and earned us the con
tempt cf mankind
He reiterated that the war was in
evitable although doubtless Mr
Kruscr would have preferred to wait
until England was involved with some
other power
Referring to the conditions under
which the Gladstone government
granted the convention ot 1881 he
denied that the grant was made be
cause Mr Gladstone feared a general
Dutch rising
The real reason he aoserted was
because the Gladstone government be
lieved the annexation of the Trani
vaal In 1877 occurred under a misap
prehension by Lord Beaconsfleld that
a majority of the Boers desired annex
ation It wes afterward proved taut
this wis not their desire and the an
nexation Was cancelled
Referring to the basis and condi
tions of settlement after the war Mr
Chanberlaln said I do not like to
divide the skin before I have caught
the bear but I must insist that the
Boers by their own action have
created a clean sheet upon which we
can write what wo please and I feel
convinced that our loyal fellow sub
jects in Cape Colony and Natal would
regard no solution as durable which
did not provido beyond the shadow of
a doubt for the supremacy ot the Brit
ish flag the only guarantee of settled
peace and the only security for the
just treatment of all the races ot South
Africa
Hw tie at Modder River
London Nov 30 Twelve hours re
section upon Lord Methuens brief
dlupatch only served to Increase pub
lic anxiety and suspense All kinds of
speculation aro Indulged in In the
absence of any indication as to wheth
er the Boers occupied the north or
south bank of Modder river the beat
opinion Inclines to the latter theory
and It Is pointed out that the British
must have been utterly exhausted If
they could not follow up the retiring
Boers and crush them as the enemy
crowded over the bridge their compul
sory line of retreat Colonel Albrecbt
who is directing the work of the Boers
in opposing Lord Methuen was orig
inally an officer in the Austraa army
