!i THE MESSAGE
PRESIDENT ROOSEVELT IN THE
FAVOR OF JAPS.
The* president* mrmnge was laid bo
fore congress after the opening last
Tuesday. Printed copies wore placed
on the"desks of nil who'closely' follow
ed the reading. :r,VI .mM .Aill' 1*
President Roosevelt, in his message
delivt-red to congress, urges:
Pawagns of a law prohibiting all
corporations from contributing to cam
paign expenses of any party.
Law conferring upon the government
the right of appeal in oriminal cases
on questions of law. This an tinre ii
designed to prevent govern merit prose
cution of trustß and ot'.oi violators of
federal statutes being booked by unfa
vorable inlings in inft rfor courts on
technicalities.
A law t<> prevent setting asido jwlge
nients of inferior courts on immaterial
technicalities is also recommended.
A bill limiting number of Hours of
labor of railway employes. The presi
dent niters a general plea for the intro
duction of the eight hour day in
branches of labor. He excepts the
Panama cflnal work on the ground that
existing conditions are most unfavora
ble.
Federal investigation of the child
and woman labor problem. Also dras
tic law for territory under federal jur
isdiction.
More complete employers' liability
law placing "trade risks" for injuries
sustained by embploye on employer.
Institution of federal commission to
investigate and arbitrate disputes be
tween labor and oapital.
Withdrawal of remaining govern
ment coal lands from sale on entry ex
cept under especial circumstances.
Lands to let to piivate individuals un
der royalty system, with government
retaining sufficient control to prevent
excessive prices to consumers or unfair
freight rates in transportation of pro
duct.
Graduated income and graduated in
teritanoe tax on the theory that the
man of great wealth «wes a peonliar
obligation to the state beoause *he de
rive speoial advantages from the mere
existence of the government.
An act specifically providing for the
naturalization of Japanese who come
here intending to become American
citizens Recommends amendments to
permit president to enforce rights of
aliens under treaties. Aotion shutting
Japanese out of Man Francisco scuoolb
denounces as wicked absurdity.
Concerning the prevailing troublo
over Japanese in schools of San Fran
oisco the president says he will do all
in his power on behalf of the Japanese,
and all the forces of the United Slates,
military and civil, which he may law
full/ wsa. will hft ho employed. His re
marks are highly laudatory of the Jap
anese.
In regard to the application of the
injunction process to labor troubles the
prsideut urges that abuse of the power
be provided against by some such law
as he advocated last year. Prohibition
of the r.se of injunctions altogether is
not favoied. Hasty action of judges
in*granting ill advised restraining or
ders is criticised.
The president takes his usual strong
stand against lynching, devoting con
siderable time to discussion of the race
question in the South.
He advocates oapital punishment by
legal process for the crime of rape.
The path marked out by congress
last year is reoommended as the best
plan for dealing with the differences
between oapital and labor. Preachers
of discontent on the laborers' side and
wealthy violators of the law are placed
in the same oategory and the suppres
sion of both are urged by all regular
means. The operation of the inter
state commerce law is cited as refuta
tion of the claim that it would ruin
the railroads on the one hand and that
it did not go far enough on the other.
Greatly increased earnings have been
shown by the roads in the five mouths
the law has been effective, and the
same period has produced an • unprece
dented number of reductions in freight
tariffs and fares. Two days before the
law went into effect on Aug. 27 the
commission* received ;l notices of over
5,000 separat tariffs, each representing
a reduction. Federal ooutrol of the
roads is urged as the beet possible anti
dotes for the agitation toward govern
ment ownership aid socialistic princi
ples. I i! .•■'.' \ -i;. <■■', I •■: rnjai [j
The president holds that the govern
ment should not conduct j the business
of the nation, but that it shnold exer
cise such supervision as will insure its
being] oonduoted in the interestt of the
nation. ; This role is made applicable
to both organized capital and organized
labor; •••ifiiv)'j -,o,ii bite
Hearty oonourrenoe is; given the
Grand Army proposition to erect an
amphitheater for the observance of
Memorial day at the National cemetery
at Arlington, near Washington city.
In regard to the marriage and divorce
quest on the president believes that
problem should be relegated to the an
thority of the national congress in or
der 1p secure uniformity of divorce
laws »nd also because it would confer
on oofagreas the power to deal radically
and efficiently with polygamy.
W En louragement to American ship

in th report bubmittod to the last con
gress i |v;
Th^ president do<* not^prees any pa
ticuUr plan for currency reform, but

The recent revolution in Cuba and
action of this country Is rehearsed and
the coming election in the island set
as the mark for ending the provisional
government unless it is shown that the
Cubans are still unable to carry on their
governmen unaided. The president
promises a full report later on his visit
to Panama.
The need for amending the laws gov
erning sealing in the north is pointed
out in a recital of the ruthless slaugh
ter of seals that has reduced the herd
on Pribolof island from nearly 5,000,
--000 to less than 200 000. The incident
in which live Japanese poachers were
killed last summer is mentioned and
the government will establish still more
a. iiw;tt> patrol next season.
Under the head of peace and right
eousness the president makes a strong
plea for honorable peace.but holds that
war is justifiable and imperative when
peace cun be obtained only by sacrifice
of conscientious conviction or of na
tional welfare,.

quested for coast defense departments

China's Trade Slackens.
The tea and silk trades of China are

account f'-r only 45 per cent. The
commissioner of customs at Canton is
authority for the statement that the
tea industry seems doomed.

'great advancement made
in western states.
Alaska, Colorado and Nevada Show
Largest Gains —Nearly Four Hun
dred Million in Gold Produced in
the States of the Union—Statistics
From Other Countries.
Tht> bureau of the mint and the geo
logical survey which are eo-opr-rating
In determining th<> annual production
of gold and silver in the United States,
have agrrcil upon I tabulated state
ment of the output of states and terri
tories for the calendar year 1905.
The most important changes In gold
production are shown by Alaska,
which advances from $9,160,500 in 1904
to $14,925,600 in 1905. Colorado shows
nn increase from 824,886,800 in 1904 to
$26,701,100 in 1905, due to freedom
from labor troubles. Nevada shows a
gain from $4,307,800 in to $5,359,
--100 in 1905, and a gain in silver from
2,t;(.t. r).100 to 5,863,500 ounces.
The dii K!tor of the mint, says that
Nevada v ill show for 1906 a much
larger gain in both gold and silver,
and that the state will likely make a
■oniest for first place as a producer
of the various previous metal. The to
tal output of silver is about 1,500,000
ounces under that of the previous
year, the three heaviest producers,
Montana, Colorado and Utah, showing
a decline. Washington produced $370,
--000 gold and 119,400 ounces of silver.
Idaho produced $1,075,600 gold and 8.
--125,600 ounces of silver. Oregon's gold
output was $1,244,000 and Montana pro
duced $4,889,300 gold and 5,863,500
ounces silver.
The total number of ounces of gold
produced was 4.265.742, and the com
mercial value of the silver produced
was $34,221,976.
The director of the mint has also
completed a compilation of returns
upon the production of gold and silver
in the world for the calendar year
1905.
The totals nre $370,289,200 gold and
157,339,362 ounces of silver.
Commenting on these figures, the di
rector says:
The total figures compare with a
gold output of $346,892,200 in 1904, and
a silver output of 168,390,238 fine
ounces. The important gains in gold
production were $7,716,000 by the Unit
ed States, $27,415,200 by Africa and
$2,655,900 by Mexico. Losses in gold
production were $1,913,000 by Canada,
$1,840,800 by Australasia, $2,511,400 by
Russia. All of the principal silver-pro
ducing countries showed a falling off
in the output of that metal c^irnprj^pd
with the previous year, the Uimed
States of 1,500,000 ounces, Mexico' of
6,156,000 ounces, Australasia 2,000,000
ounces, South America of 1,742,000
ounces and Japan of nearly 1,000.000
ounces. The average value of silver
in New York, based on London prices,
converted at the current, rates of ex
change, was 61 cents per fine ounce,
which may be compared with 58 cents
for 11*04, 57 cents for 1903 and 52
cents for 1902, the lowest year's price
on record.
The United States produced $88,180,
--700 gold and 56,101,600 ounces silver.
Mexico produced $15,261,200 gold
and 54,652,892 ounces silver.
Canada produced $14,486,800 gold
and $5,974,875 ounces silver.
Africa produced $113,329,100 gold
and 619,620 ouncea silver.

MINERS ARE
LEGALLY HELD
Washington, Deo. 4.—The federal
supreme court has denied tho hapeaa
oorptw of Moyer, Heywood and Petti
pone, the representatives of the West
ern Federation of Miners, who are now
held in prison in Idaho on the charge
of complicity in the mnrder of ex-Gov
ernor Stennenerg,adversely to the men.
The opinion whs py Justice Harlan.
The effect of the decision will pc to
contiue to hold the men for trial in
Idaho.
Of the men involved, Charles H.
Moyer is president; W. D. Heywood
secretary-treasurer, and George A.Pet
tibone, a memer of the Western Feder
ation of Miners. They are now in pris
on at Boise, Idaho, under a charge of
murdering ex-Uovernor Frank Steunen
berg of that state, although it was not
charged that they wore present when
the orime was committed. The cases
came to this court on an appeal from
a decision of the Idaho federal court,
refusing to grant writs of habeas cor
pus. Tho inian point was the method
by which the Idaho authorities secured
jurisdiction over the men. All of them
are residents of Colorado and it was al
leged on behalf of Moyer aud his asso
ciates that they were kidnaped in pur
suance of a conspiracy to which the
governor of Colorado and the Idaho
authorities were parties, and hence
that jurisdiction was acquired by
fraud.
Justice Harlan said that iv the ha
beas corpus in federal courts the meth
od of extradtiion of the defendants was
not material. The merits of the case*
were not inrolved, as that phase wan
not presented. The only question in-
Tolved was the right of te state courts
to proceed with the oases.
.instice McKenna delivered a dissent
ing opinion holding that Moyer, Hey
wood and Pettibone had a right to in
roke the aid of the federal ooorts to
oorreot improper methods used in se
cnring their extradition. He said that
kidnaping under the law is no more to
be justified than when performed out
sdie the law where every effort of au
thority is used to prevent and punish it.

ALL THE WEST SHORT OF FUEL.
A Single Heavy Bnow May Precipitate
a Calamity.
Denver, Col., Dec. 4 With winter
at hand and more or less serious rail
rcal blockades threatened at any
time, the entire country west of the
Missouri rlrer and almest from the
Canadian border to the Rio Grande,
is running literally on little more than
a handful of coal. At hardly any city
in the west is there more than one or
two days' supply of fuel on hand.
Many manufacturing industries hare
actually been compelled to suspend
business for lack of coal. The supply,
even for the people's homes, may be
cut off with the first severe storm.
With ■ single heavy snow positive
danger will take the place of incon
venience.
Managers of the transportation and
coal companies attribute the condition
to the country's unprecedented growth
and to the enormous demands upon
them. Having delayed too long, they
are bending every energy to replenish
the fuel supply.
The consumers generally do not ac
cept this explanation. They say the
trouble is due to the clutch of mo
nopoly on the mines of Wyoming,
Utah, Colorado and other western
sates. in proof of this assertion they
point to the disclosures before the
interstate commerce commission, dur
ing last week's hearing at Salt Lake
City.
It is estimated that the fuel supply
would be ample but for the seizure of
all valuable coal properties along the
railroad rights of way and to the check
put by heavy freight charges on de
velopment by independent firms.
TEXAS TRAIN IS ROBBED.
Express Messenger Beaten and Hurled
Off Train.
Redwater, Tex., Dec. 3.—The express
car attached to train No. 4 of the Cot
ton Belt route, was robbed and Ex
press Messenger W. A. urissip hurled
from the moving train after having
been beaten and badly wounded by the
robbers. The robbery, it is believed,
occurred about a mile from this place,
but was not discovered until the train
reached Eylau, the next stop. The ex
press messenger was found beside the
track, badly hurt, and showed indica
tions of a desperate fight. The robbers
escaped.
That the robbery was successful is
evident so far as a hasty inspection of
the car and its contents would indicate,
but the amount stolen is not known.
At Eylau Conductor Blair, who was
in charge of the train, saw that the
door of the express car had been
forced, and on entering found it splat
tered with blood, the messenger miss
ing and the car bearing every appear
ance of having been looted. The train
men were sent back on hand cars and
Qrisalp was found. While he is badly
hurt, it is not believed that his injuries
will prove fatal.
CONFIDENCE !N ROOSEVELT.
Japan Is Not Worrying About San
Francisco Muddle.
Washington, Dec. 4. —"Japan has
every confidence that President Roose
velt will adjust the Japanese-California
school controversy entirely to the sat
isfaction of both nations. Feeling this
confidence, Japanese ceased to be agi
tated over the situation. The Japanese
newspapers are emphatically moderate
in all their notices of the affair and
so far as the Japanese nation is con
cerned, there is absolutely no reason
for the revival of the newspaper no
toriety in this country."
The Associated Press was today au
thorized to quote the Japanese embas
sy as above. It was further said that
there were no new developments in
the situation of any kind; that the mat
ter was in the hands of the president
and his willingness and ability to act
was en irely relied upon.
Crown Prince in Name Only.
Belgrade, Servia, Dec. 4.—The re
port that Crown Prince Karageorge
ritch has become insane and that he
will be confined in a foreign asylum
has caused great excitement in Bel
grade, despite the fact that it has been
officially denied that there is any truth
in the rumor.
People close to the throne declare
that while the future monarch is prob
ably not really violently insane, there
is no doubt that he is not strong
mentally and he is hardly likely to
ever reign as king.
Peary Sees the President.
Wabhington, Dec. 3. —Commander R.

He was heartily congratulated by

reach the Arctic regions by means of
an airship, was at the executive office
when Commander Peary arrived. The

Los Angeles, Cal., Dec. 3. —Walter

Consistory May Be Postponed.
Rome, Dec. 4.—lt Is probable that

red hat on that date.
If you talk poverty, think poverty
and act poverty long enough, you will
