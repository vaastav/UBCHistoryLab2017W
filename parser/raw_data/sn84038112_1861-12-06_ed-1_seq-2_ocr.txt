It is said of Napoleon hy Jomini that, i

of April had a regular army of 266,606 , ueu .
On tho 1st of June he had increased this force
to 414,000. The like proportion, adds Jomini,
"had he thoaght; proptr to inaugurate a vast
system of defence, would have raised it to
700,660 men by the 1st of Heptember." At the
commencement of this rebellion, inaugurated by

By agreement between the States named,
such ns was effected, for similar purposes, by
Michigan and Ohio, aud by Missouri und Iowa,
their boundaries could lie so changed as to
dor the capital more remote than ot preseut from
tho influence of State Governments which have
arrayed thombelveB in rebellion against the
Federal authority. To this eud, the limits of
Virginia might bo so altered as ti
boundaries consist of tho BIuo llidgc
and Pennsylvania on the north, leaving those
the south aud west as present. By this arraugc
couutics of Maryland (Alleghany nud
Washington) would bo transferred to the juris
diction of Virginia. All that portion of Virginia
which lies between the Blue Ridge
peake Bay could then lie added to Maryland,
while that portion of the peninsula between tho
Chesapeake and the Atlnutio,
conjointly held by Maryland and Virginia, could
be incorporated in the State of Delaware. A
