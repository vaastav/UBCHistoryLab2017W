The Nary.'
The annual report of the Secretary of the Navy
shows the navy to be in a remarkably efficient
condition, both as regards the numoer 01 vessels
and their armament and sea-going qualities. The
navy at present consists of 163 vessels, with 1,354
guns. Of iron-clad or armored vessels, sixteen
arc of a class and in condition for actual and
efficient service. Four others, of the class of
powerful double-turreted monitors, are actually
on hand undergoing repairs, and a fifth is well
worm xne same - attention, dui tne re
mainder mav be counted as reallv useless for
any active and efficient purpose. One-half
of the steam navv adapted to cruising is in com
mission and in actual service. This number of
vessels cannot be prudently diminished ; hut, if
it is to be maintained, there mnst be a gradual
and constant addition to the navy to supply the
places of those which are each year found to be
worn out and unfit for further service, and for
this purpose a nxea amount lor tonnage snouia
be built every year. This tonnage may be small,
but it should be constant and unfailing. To
this end the department has accumulated
large amount of live-oak timber in various navy
yards, where it will yearly improve in condition
and ne avauaDie as tne very pest material ior tne
frames of any ships it may at any time be neces
sary or desirable to build. The rapid and almost
complete aisappearance ot tnis most vainanie
ship-lumber from our shores, large Quantities
being sent abroad, should arrest the attention of
congress, ana measures snouia oe taxen to
cure what remains.
The Secretary recites the facts in the Virginias
affair, and refers to the yellow-fever epidemic at
Pensacola and the great naval trial off the coast
of Florida. He recommends that if the Icelandic
committee sent out in a Government vessel to
examine several points on the Alaska coast with
a view to settlement by their countrymen shall
find at. anv point on the Pacific coast a satisfac
tory location, whatever assistance the Govern
ment is competent to extend toward
tahlihinfr an Icelandic colonv - there be
promptly offered, as the Icelanders would
be a valuable and fruitful source of supply to the
naval service of trained American seamen in
time of need. The Secretary calls attention to
the Importance of the Hydrographic office. He
thinks special attention should be given to sur
veys of the North Pacific Ocean,- and urges the
propriety of increasing and developing the re
sources of the navv vards. The applana
tions applicable to the fiscal year ending June
30, 1874, inolnding the unexpended balance
of appropriations for the building of " new
sloops, and special appropriations to reimburse
the bureaus for their great expenditures during
the threatened complications with Spain,
amounted in the aggregate to $27,147,857, and the
actual expenditures for the same period from
these appropriations amounted to 26.254.155. or
about $'.KK),000 less than the whole amount. The
appropriations made available for the current
year, commencing July 1. 1874, amount in
the aggregate to $19,273,731. The amount
of these appropriation for the cur

PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE.
To tho Senate and Honse of Representatives :
THE BUSINESS PROSTRATION.
Since the opening of Congress one year
ago the nation has undergone a prostration In
business and the industries such as has not
been witnessed with us for many years. Spefe.
uiation as to the causes for this prostriHioh
might be Indulged in-ithout profit, because
as many theories Would bp advanced as there
would be independent writers who should
express their own views upon the sub
ject. Without indulging in thcorf" is
to the cause of this prOsf-ation, therefore,
I will call yenrf attention only to the
fact hd to some questions as to
which it would seem there should be no dis
agreement. During this prostration two es
sential elements of prosperity have been
most abundant labor and capital. Both
have been largely unemployed-. AYherc se
curity has been undoubted capital has been
attainable at very moderate rates... Where
labor has been wanted; it has been found in
abundance at cheap rates-, compared with
what of the necessaries and comfbirte of life
could be purchased With the wages demand
ed. Two gret elements of prosperity, there
fore have not been denied us; a third might
be added. Our soil and climate are nn's
qualed within .the limits Vf any contigu
ous territory under one nationality for its va
rieties of products to feed and clothe a people
and in the amount of surplus to spare to feed
less-favored people. Therefore, with these
facts in view, it seems to me that wise states
manship at this session of Congress would dic
tate ignoring the past distributing in prop
er channels these great elements of prosperity
to any people. Debt abroad is the only ele
ment that can, With always a sound cmencj?,
enter into our affairs to caue aiiy 'continued
depression in the industries and prosperity of
our people-. ..
"the currency.
A great conflict for national existence made
necessary, for temporary purposes, the rais
ing of large sums of money from whatever
source attainable. It was made necessary in
the wisdom of Congress, and I do not
doubt their wisdom in the premises,
regarding the necessity of the time,
to devise a system of national currencv. which
it is proved to be impossible to keep oh a
par with the recognized currency ot
the civilized world. This teegot & spirit
of speculation Involving an extrava
gance and luxury not required for the
happiness or prosperity Of a people, and in
volving, both directly and indirectly, foreign
indebtedness. The currency being of a fluctu
ating value, and unsafe to hold for legitimate
transactions requiring money-, became sub
ject of speculation in itself. These two causes,
however, have involved us in a foreign
indebtedness contracted in good faith by the
borrower and the lender, which should be paid
in coin and according to the bond agreed
upon when the debt was contracted gold or
its equivalent. The good faith of the Gov
ernment cannot be violated toward its
creditors at the national disgrace. Our com
merce should be encouraged; American ship
building and carrying capacity increased;
foreign markets sought for products of the
soil and manufactories, to the end that we
may be able to pay these debts. Where a mar
ket can be created for the sale of our products,
either of the soil, the mine or the manufactory
a new means is discovered of utilizing our idle
capital and labor to the advantage of the
whole people; but in my judgment the
first, uteri toward accomnlishiny this ob
ject is to secure a currency good wherever
civilization reigns one wnicn, n 11 Decomes
superabundant with one people will find a
market with some other a currency which
has as its basis the labor necessary to pro
duce it which will give it value. Gold and
silver are now tne recognized medium 01
exchange the civilized world over, and to this
we should return with the least practicable
delay. In view tot . the pledges of the
American ' Congress when our present
legal-tender system was adopted and
tne debt contracted mere snouia oe
no delay, certainly no unnecessary delay, m
fixing by legislation a method by which we
will return to specie. To the accomplish
ment of this end I invite your special atten
tion. I believe firmly that there can be no
prosperous and permanent revival of business
and the industries until a policy is adopted)
with legislation to carry it out, looking to a
return to a specie basis. It is easy to con
ceive that the debtor and speculative classes
may think it of value to make a so
called niohey abundant until they can throw
a portion of their business upon others; but
even these, I believe, would be disappointed
by the result u a course snouia De pursued
which will keep in doubt the value of the
legal-tender medium of exchange. A revival
of the productive industries is needed
by all classes, and bv none more than
the holders of property, of whatever sort,
witn aeots to liquidate irom tne realization
upon its sales. But admitting that the two
classes of citizens referred to are to be ben
efited by expansion, would it be honest to
e-ive it? Would not the ereneral loss be too
great to justify such relief? Would it not be
just as honest and prudent to authorize
each debtor to issue his own legal-tenders to
the extent of his liabilities as to do this ?
Would it not be safer, for fear of over-issues
by unscrupulous creditors, to say that all
debts and obligations are obliterated in the
United States, and now we commence anew.
each possessing all he has at the time
free from incumbrance? These propositions
are too absurd to be entertained for a mo
ment bv thinkintr people. Every delay iu the
preparation for final resumption partakes of
luis uisnoneBty, uiiu. is umy icbb in uegret; as
the hope is held out that a convenient season
will at last arrive for the good work of
redeeming our pledges to commence. It
will never come, in my opinion, except by
the positive action of Congress or by na
tional disasters, which will destroy, for a
time at least, the credit of individuals and
the State at large. I believe it is in
the power of Congress at this session
to devise such legislation as will renew confi
dence, revive all the industries, start us on a
career of prosperity to last for many years,
and to save the credit of the nation and of the
people. Steps toward the return to a specie
basis are the great requisites to this devout-
ly-to-be-sought-for end. There are other
points I may touch upon hereafter.
A nation dealing in a currencv below that
of specie in value labors under two great dis
advantages. First, having no use for the
world's acknowledged medium oi exchange,
gold and silver, these are driven out
of ' the country, because there is no
demand for their use: second, the me
dium of exchange in use being of
fluctuating value, for. after all. it is
only worth just what it will purchase of gold
ana suver, metais naving an mstrinsic value
just in proportion to the honest labor it takes
to produce them. A large margin must be
allowed for profit by the manufacturer and
producer. It is months from the date of pro
duction to the date of realization. Interest
upon capital must be charged and risk of
nuctuauon m tne vaiue 01 tnat wnicn is to
be receive in payment added; hence high
prices, acting as a protection to the
ioreign producer, wno received nothing
m exchange for the product of his
skill and labor except a currency
good at a stame value tne world over.
It seems to me .that nothing: is clearer than
that the greater part of the burden of existing
prostration for the want of a sound financial
system falls upon the workingman. who must
after all produce the wealth, and the salaried
man who superintends and conducts business.
The burden falls upon them two ways: by the
deprivation 01 employment and by the de
creased purchasing power of their salaries.
it is the duty 01 tjongFess to devise tne metnod
of correcting the evus which are acknowl
edged to exist, and not mine; but I will ven
ture to suggest two or three things which
seem to me as absolutely necessary to a re
turn to specie payments the first great
requisite in a return to prosperity.
The legal-tender clause to the law au
thorizing the issue of currencv bv
tne national uovernment snouia De repealed.
to take effect as to all contracts entered into
after a day fixed in the repealing act, not to
apply, however, to payments of salaries by
the Government or for other expenses now
provided by law to be paid in
currency. In the interval pending between
the repeal and final resumption, provision
should be made by which the Secretary of the
Treasury can obtain gold, as it may become
necessary from time to time, from the date
when specie resumption commences. lofclns
might and should be addedj a revenue suffi
ciently in excess of expenses to insure an ac
cumulation of gold in the Treasury to sustain
redemption.
I commend this subject to vour careful con
sideration, believing that a favorable solution
is attainable, and that if reached by this Con
gress the present and future generations will
ever gratefully remember it as their deliverer
from a thralldom of evil and disgrace. With
resumption free banking may be authorized
with safety, giving full protection to bill-hold
ers, which they have not under the existing
laws. Indeed, I would regard free banking
as essential. It would give a proper elasticity
to the currency. A s more currency should
be required for the transaction of legiti
mate business, new banks would be
started, and in turn banks would
wind no their business when
was found there was a superabundance of
currency. The experience and judgment of
the people can best decide just how much
currency is required for the transaction of
the business of the country. It is unsafe to
leave the settlement of the Question to Con
gress, the Secretary of the treasury, or the
Executive. Congress should make the regula
tions under which banks may exist, but
should not make banking a monopoly by
limiting the amount of redeemable paper cur.
rency that sh all be authorized. Such impor
tance do I attach to this subject, and so ear
nestly do I commend it to your attention-, that
1 give it prominence by introUuclng it at the
beginqg ci this message.

been given, and the treaty will accordingly
terminate on the 1st day of July, 1875. This
convention secured to certain Belgian vessels
entej-in.K the ports of the United States ex-
pnonal privileges which are not accorded
to our own vessels. The other features of
the convention have proved satisfactorv and
have tended to the cultivation of beneficial
commercial intercourse and friendly rela-
ions oetween the two countries. I hope that
the negotiations which have been invited will
result in the celebration of another treaty
which may tend to the interests of both coun
tries. Our relations with Chiua continue tb be
friendly. Durilla- the cast v'car the feai- of
hstiitfcs between China and Japiin, growing
out 01 tne landing 01 an armed torce upon tne
island of Formosa by- the latter, has occa
sioned uneasine"?. It is earnestly hoped,
however, that the difficulties arising from this
cause will be adjusted, and that the advance
of civilization in these Empires mav not be
retarded by a state of war. In con
sequence of the part taken by cer
tain citizens of the United States in this
expedition our representatives in those coun
tries have been instructed to impress upon
"the Governments of China and Japan the firm
intention of this country to maintain strict
neutrality in the event of hostilities and care
fully prevent tiny infraction of the law on the
paH Of Out , cltizenS. In connection with this
subject. I call the attention of Congress to a
generally conceded fact that the great propor
tion oi uninese immigrants who come to our
shores do not come voluntarily to make
their homes with us and their labor oro-
ductive of general prosperity, but they.come
under contract with neaa men, who owntliem
almost absolutely. In a worse form does this
apply to the Chinese women. Hardly a per
ceptible percentage of them perform any
honorable labor. They are brought for
shameful purposes, to the disgrace of the
communities where they have settled, and to
the great demoralization of the youths of
those localities. If this evil practice can be
legislated against it will be my pleasure as
wen as auty to eniorce any regulation to se
cure so desirable an end.
It is hoped that negotiations between the
Government of Japan and the treaty powers,
looking to the lurtner openmg or the Empire
and the removal of various restrictions upon
trade and travel, may soon produce
the result desired, which cannot fail
to inure to the beneiSt of all the parties.
Having on previous occasions submitted to
the consideration of Congress the propriety
of the release of the J apanese Government
from the further payment ?f indemnity Un
der the convention Of Oct. 22; 1864; and
as no action had been taken therein; it be
comes iny duty to regard the obligations of
the Convention as in Force; and; as the other
powers interested have obtained their portion
of the indemnity in full, the Minister of the
United States m Japan has, in behalf of this
Government, received the remainder of the
amount due to the United States under the
Convention of Simouseky. I submit the pro
priety of applying the income of a part, if not
the whole, of this fund to the education in the
Japanese language of a number of young
men, to be under obligations to serve the
Government for a specified time as Interpret
ers at the legation and the consulates in
Japan. A limited number of Japanese youths
might at the same time be educsted in our
own vernacular, and mutual benefit would re
sult to. both Governments. The importance
of having pur own Citizens competent and fa
miliar with the language of Japan, to act as
interpreters and in other capacities connected
with the legation and consulates in that coun
try, cannot readily be over-estimated.
The amount awarded to the Government of
Great Britain by the commission organized
under the provisions of the Treaty of Wash
ington, in settlement of the claims of British
subjects arising froth acts committed between
April 18; 186i. aid April 9, 1865, became pay
able under terms 01 tne treaty within the past
year, and was paid upon the 21st day of Sep
tember, 1874.
ALIEN CLAIMS AGAINST THE CNITET STATES.
In this connection I renew my recommenda
tion, made at the opening of the last session
of Congress, that a special court be created
to hear and report all claims of aliens against
the United States arising from acts com
mitted against their persons or property
during the insurrection. It appears equi
table that opportunity should be of
fered to citizens of other States to
present their claims, as well as
those British subjects whose claims were not
admissible under the late commission, to the
early decision of some competent tribunal.
10 tnis end 1 recommend tne necessary legis
lation to organize a court to dispose of those
claims of aliens of the nature referred to in
an equitable and satisfactory manner, and to
relieve Congress and the departments from
the consideration of these questions.
THE COLONY OF NEWFOUNDLAND.
The legislation necessarv to extend to the
colony of Newfoundland certain articles of
the Treaty of Washington of the 8th of May,
1S71, having been had, a protocol to that
effeet was signed in behalf of the United
States and of Great Britain on the 28th day of
May last, and was duly proclaimed on the
following day. A copy of the proclamation
is submitted herewith.
THE NORTHWESTERN BOUNDARY.
A copy of the report of the Commission
appointed under the act of March 19, 1872,
for surveying and marking the boundary be
tween the United States and the British
Possessions, from the Lake of the Woods to
tne summit or the Kocky Mountains, is here
with transmitted. I am happy to announce
that the field work of the Commission
has been completed, and the entire line.
from the northwest corner of the Lake of
the Woods to the summit of the Rocky
Mountains, has been run and marked upon
the surface of the earth. It is believed that
the amount remaining unexpended of the
appropriation made at the last session of Con
gress will be sufficient to complete the office
work. I recommend that the authority of
uongress De given to use the unexpended
balance of the appropriation in the comple
tion of the work of the Commission, in
making the report and printing the necessary
map.
THE ALABAMA CLAIMS.
The court known as the Court of Commis
sioners of Alabama Claims, created by an act
01 congress the last session, has organized
and commenced the work, and it is to be
hoped that the claims admissible under the
provisions of the act may be speedily ascer
tained and paid.
UNITES STATES CITIZENS AND REAL ESTATE
IN TURKEY.
It has been deemed advisable to exercise
the discretion conferred upon the Executive
at the last session by accepting the conditions
required by the Government of Turkey for the
privilege of allowing citizens of the United
States to hold real estate in the former coun
try by assenting to a certain change in the
iurisdiction of the courts in the latter. A
copy 01 tne proclamation upon these subjects
is nerewitn communicated.
MEXICO AND SOUTH AMERICA.
There has been no material change in our
relations with the independent States of this
hemisphere which were formerly under the
dominion of Spain. Marauding on the
frontiers between Mexico and Texas still fre
quently takes place, despite the vigilance of
the civil and military authorities in that
quarter. The difficulty of checking such
trespasses along the course of a river of such
length as the K10 Grande, and so often ford
able, is obvious. It is hoped that the efforts
of this Government will be seconded by those
of Mexico, to the effectual suppression of acts
01 wrong.
From a report upon the condili 1 of the
business before the American and Mexican
Joint Claims Commission, made by the agent
on tne part 01 tne united states, ana dated
Oct. 28, 1874, it appears that of the 1,017
claims filed on the part of the citizens of the
United States 483 had been finally decided and
75 were in the hands of the umpire, leaving 462
lu ue uispuseu 01; aim 01 tne wo claims tiea
against the United States 726 had been finally
decided on, one was before the umpire anil
271 remained to be disposed of. Since the
date of such report other claims have been
disposed of, reducing somewhat the number
still pending, and others have been passed
upon by the arbitrators. It has become ap
parent, in view of these figures and of the
fact . that the work devolving on the
umpire is particularly laborious, that
the Commission would be unable to
dispose of the entire number of
claims rjendinar Drior to the 1st dav of Febru.
ary, 1875, the date fixed for its expiration,
jxegouations are pending looking to the se
curing of the results of the decisions which
have been reached and to a further extension
of the Commission for a limited time, which,
it is confidently hoped, will suffice to bring
ail tne business belore it to a final close.
The strife of the Argentine Republic is to
be deplored, both on account of the parties
thereto and from the probat le effects of the
interests of those engnged In the .trtlde to
that quarter, of whpffl the United States are
amon the jiripcipal. As yet, so far as I am
aware, there has been no violation of our
neutrality rights, which, as well as our
duties in that respect, it shall be my endeavor
to maintain and observe.
It is with regret I announce that no further
payment has been received from the Govern;
men t of Venezuela on account of awards iii
favor of citizens of the United States. Hopes
have been entertained that if the Republic
could escape both foreign and civil war for a
few years its great natural resources would
enable it to honor its obligations. Though it
is now understood to be at peace v-ith other
countries, a serious insurrection is reported
to be in progress in an important region of
that Republic. This may be taken advantage
of as another reason to delay the payment ot
the dues of our citizens.
CUBA AND SPAIN.
The deplorable strife in Cuba continues
without any marked change in the relative ad-"
vantages of the contending forces. The in:
surrection continues, but Spain has gained no
superiority. Six years of strife give the in
surrection a significance wlilcli cannot be
ignrii'ed. Its duration and the tenacity of its
adherents, together with the absence of man
ifested power of suppression on the part of
Spain, cannot be controverted, and may make
some positive steps on the part of other
powers a matter of self-necessity.
I had confidently hoped at this time to be
pAp, to announce an. arrangement of some of
the important 'questions between thi? Govern
ment and that of Spain, but the negotiations
liave been protracted. The unhappy intes
tine dissensions of Spain command our pro
found sympathy, and must be accepted as,
perhaps, a cause for some delay. An early
settlement, in part at least, of tho questions
between the Governments is hoped for. In
the meantime, awaiting the results of immediately-pending
negotiations, I defer a fur
ther and fuller communication on the subject
of the relations of this country and Spain.
EXPATRIATION AND NATURALIZATION.
I have atrain to call the attention of Con
gress to the unsatisfactory Condition of the
eSisthlg laws ith reference .to expatriation
and the election 01 nationality., formerly,
amid contacting opinions ana aecisions; it
was difficult to exactly determine how far the
doctrine of perpetual allegiance was appli
cable to the United States. Congress, by the
act of the 27th of July, lsbS, asserted
the abstract right of expatriation as a
fundamental principle of this Government.
Notwithstanding such assertion and the ne
cessity of the frequent application of the prin:
ciple no legislation has been had defining
what acts or formalities shall work expatria
tion, or when a citizen shall be deemed to
have removed or to have lost his citizenship.
The importance of such a definition
is obvious. The representatives of the
United States in foreign countries are
continually called upon to lend their aid and
the protection of the United States to per
sons concerning the good faith or the reality
of whose citizenship there is at least great
question. In some cases the provisions of the
treaties furnish some guide; in others it
seems left to the persons claiming the bene
fit of citizenship while living in a foreign
country, contributing in ho manner to the
performance of the duties of a citizen of the
United States, and without the intention at
any time to return and undertake those du
ties, to use the claim of citizenship of the
United States simply as a shield from the per
formance Of the obligations of a citizen else
where: .
The status of children born Of American
parents residing in a foreign country, of
American women who have married aliens,
or American citizens residing abroad, where
such question is not regulated by treaty, are
all sources 01 irequent dimcuity ana discus
sion. Legislation on these ana similar ques
tions, and particularly defining when and un
der what circumstances expatriation can be
accomplished, or is to be presumed, is espe
cially needed.
In this connection 1 earnestly can me atten
tion of Congress to the difficulties arisipg
from fraudulent naturalization. The United
States wisely, freely and liberally offers its
citizenship to all who may come in good
faith to reside within its limits! on their com
plying with certain prescribed reasonable and
simple loruutuues uuu cuuuilluun .aiiiuu U1C
highest duties ot tne uovernment is mat to
afford a firm, efficient and effectual protection
to all its citizens, whether native born or nat
uralized. Care should be taken that a right,
carrying with it such suppor4 from the Gov
ernment, should not be fraudulently obtained.
and should be bestowed only upon full proof
of a compliance with the law, as irequent in
stances of illegal and fraudulent naturaliza
tion and of unauthorized use of certificates
thus improperly obtained come to light. In
some cases the fraudulent character of the
naturalization has appeared upon the face of
the certificate itself; in others examination
discloses that the bolder had not eomplied
with the law, and in others certificates have
been obtained where the persons holding
them not onlv were not entited to be natu
ralized, but had not even been within
the United States at the time of the
pretended naturalization. Instances of
tnese classes 01 iraua are aiscoverea at
our legations, where the certincates 01
naturalization are presented either for the
purpose of obtaining passports or demanding
fraud is obvious on the face of such certificates
they are taken up by the representatives of
the Government and forwarded to the Depart
ment of State. But even the record of the
court in which the fraudulent naturalization
occurred remains, and duplicate certificates
are readily obtainable. Upon the pres
entation of these for the issue of
passports or demanding protection ot
the uovernment tne iraua sometimes
escapes notice, and such certificates are not
lnirequentiy used m transactions 01 ousiness,
to the deception and injury of innocent par
ties. Without placing any additional obstacle
In the way of the obtainment of citizenship
by the worthy and well-intentioned foreigner
who comes in good faith to cast his lot with
ours, I earnestly recommend further legisla
tion to punisn lrauduient naturalization ana
to secure the ready cancellation of the record
of every naturalization made in fraud.
TREATIES OF EXTRADITION.
Since my last annual message tne exchange
has been made of the ratification of treaties
of extradition with Belgium, Ecuador, Peru
and Salvador; also 01 a treaty 01 commerce
and navigation with Peru, and one of com
merce and conmjar privileges with Salvador;
all of which have been duly proclaimed, as
has also a declaration with Russia with refer
ence to trade-marks.
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY OF THE TREASURY.
The report of the Secretary of the Treas
ury, which by law is made directly
to Congress and forms no pan ot
this message, will show the receipts
and expenditures of the Government
for the last fiscal year, the amount received
from each source of revenue, and the amount
paid out for each of tne departments 01 tne
Government. It will be observed from this
report that the amount of receipts over
expenditures has been but $2,344,882.30 for
the fiscal year ending June 30, 1874, and that
for the cut rent fiscal year the estimated re
ceipts over expenditures will not much
exeeed $9,000,000. In view of the large
national debt existing, and the obiiga-
Hon to add 1 per cent, per annum to
the sinking fund, a sum amounting now
to over $34,000,000 per annum, I submit
whether the revenues should not be increased
or the expenditures diminished. To reach
this amount of surplus and not provide for
the sinking fund is a partial failure to com
ply with the contracts and obligations of the
Government. At the last session of Congress
a very considerable reduction was made in
the rates of taxation and the number of arti
cles submitted to taxation the question may
well be asked whether or not in some in
stances unwisely.
In connection with this subject, too, I ven
ture the opinion that the means of collecting
the revenue, especially from imports, have
been embarrassed by such legislation as to
make it Questionable whether or not large
amounts are not lost by a failure to collect, to
the direct loss of the "Treasury and to the
prejudice of the interests of honest importers
and taxpayers.
The Secretary of the Treasury 111
his report favors legislation looking
to specie payments, thus support
ing the views previously expressed
in this message. He also recommends econ
omy in appropriation; calls attention to the
loss of revenue from repealing the tax on tea
or couee, without uenent to tne consumer;
recommends an increase of ten cents a gal
Ion on whisky, and, further, that no modifi
cation be made in the Banking and Currency
bill passed at the last session of Congress,
unless a modihcation should become, neces
sary by reason of the adoption of measures
for returning to specie payments. In these
recommendations I cordially join.
THE TARIFF.
I would suggest to Congress the propriety
of readjusting thctariff so as to Increase the
revenue and at the same time decrease the
number ot articles upon which duties are
levied. Those articles which enter into our
manufactures and are not produced at home.
it seems to me, should be entered free. Those
articles of manufacture which we produce a
constituent part of, but do not produce the
whole, that part which we do not produce
should enter free also. I will in
stance fine wool, dyes, etc. These articles
must be imported to form a part of the manu
facture of the higher grades of woolen goods.
Chemicals used as dyes, compounded in medi
cines and used in various ways in manufac
tures come under this class, The introduc
tion, free of duties, of such wools as we do
not produce should stimulate the manufacture
of goods requiring these. There are many
prticles entering into home manufactures
which we do not produce ourselves, the tariff
upon which increases the cost of producing
the manufactured article. All corrections
in this regard are in the direction of bringing
labor and capital into harmony with each
other and oi supplying one of the elements
of prosperity so much needed.
THE ARMY AND NAVY.
The report df the Secretary of War, here
with attached, aud forming a part of this
message, gives all the information concern
ing the operations, wants and necessi
ties of the army, and contains many
suggestions and recommendations which
I commend to your special atten
tion. There is no class of Government em
ployes who are harder worked than the army
officers and men; none who perform their
tasks more cheerfully and efficiently, and
Under circumstances of greater privation
and hardship. Legislation is desirable to
render more efficient this branch of the pub
lic service. All the recommendations of
the Secretary of War I regard as judicious,
and I especially commend to your at
tention the following: The consolidation of
Government arsenals; the restoration of mile
age to officers traveling under orders; the ex
emption of money received from the sale of
subsistence stores from being covered into the
Treasury; the use of appropriations for the
purchase of subsistence stores without wait
ing for the beginning of the fiscal year for
which the appropriation is madb; for addi
tional appropriations for the collection of tor
pedo material ; for increased appropriations
for the manufacture of arms; for relieving the
various States from indebtedness for arms
charged to them during the rebellion ; for drop
ping officers from the rolls of the army with
out " trial for the offense of drawing
pay more than once" for the same
period; for the discouragement of the
plan to pay soldiers by checks, and
for the establishment of a professor
ship of rhetoric and English literature at
West Point. The reasons for the recommenda
tions are obvious, and are set forth sufficiently
in the report attached. I also recommend
that the status of the staff corps of the army
be fiied. where this has hot already been
done, so that promotions may be made and
vacancies nuea as tney occur in eacn graae
when reduced below the number tij be fixed
by law. The necessity for such legislation is
specially felt now in the Pay Department.
The efficiency of the navy has been largely
increased during the last year, under the im
pulse ot the Ioreign compt ications wnicu
threatened us at the commencement of the
lagt session of Coneress. Most of our effi
cient wooden ships were put in condition for
immediate service, and the repairs of our
iron-clad fleet were pushed with the utmost
vigor. The result is that most of these are in
effective condition.- and need only to be
manned and set in commission to go at
once . into service. Some of the new
sIoods authorized bv Congress are already
in commission, and most of the remainder
are launched and wait only the completion of
their machinery to enable them to take their
places as part of our effective force. Two
iron torpedo-ships have been completed dur
ing the last year ; and four of our large tur
reted iron-clads are now undergoing repairs.
When they are finished) everything that is
needful of our havy, now authorized; will be
in condition for service, and with the advance
in the science of torpedo warfare the Ameri
can navy; comparatively smaii as 11 is; wm De
found at any time powerful for the purposes
of a oeacefiil nation.
. Much has also been accomplished during
the year in aid of science and to increase the
sum OI general Knowieuge aim luriuer me in
terests of commerce and civilization. Exten
sive and much-needed soundings have been
made for hydrographic purposes and to fix
the proper routes of ocean telegraphs. Fur
ther surveys of the great isthmus have been
undertaken and completed, and two vessels
of the navy are now employed, in conjunction
with those of Emrland. France. Germany and
Russia, in observations connected with the
transit of Venus, useful and interesting to the
scientific world.
The estimates for this branch of the public
service do not differ materially from those
of last year, the general support of the service
heii!r xomewhat less and those for improve
ments at Various stations rather larger than
the corresponding estimates made a year ago.
The reirular maintenance and a steady in
crease in the efficiency of this most important
arm, m proportion to the growtn 01 our mari
time intercourse and interests, is recommend
ed to the attention of Congress.
The use of the navv during peace might be
further utilized bv a direct author ization of
the employment of naval vessels in surveys
of the supposed navigable waters of other na
tionalities 011 this continent, especially the
tributaries of the two great rivers of south
America, the Oronoco and the Amazon. Noth
ing orevents. under existing laws, such ex
plorations, except mat expenditures must ue
mane in such exiieuiuuua ucvuuu uiubc uonai-
ly provided for by the appropriations. The
field designated is unquestionably one of inter
est, and one capable of a large development
of commercial interests, advantageous to the
people reached and to those who may estab
lish relations witn tnem.
EDUCATION AND THE POSTOFFICE.
The education of the people entitled
to exercise the right of franchise
regard essential to general prosperity
everywhere, and especially so in ropub
lies, where neither education nor pre
vious condition enters into account in giving
suffrage. Next to the public school the
Postoffice is the createst agent of education
over our vast territory. The rapidity with
which new sections are being settled in
creases the cost of carrying the mails in a
more rapid ratio than the increase 01 re
ceipts. The report of the Postmaster-General,
herewith attached, shows that there was
an increase of revenue in this department in
1873 over the previous year of $1,674,411,
and an increase of the cost of carry
ing- the mails and paving employes of
SS3.041.467.91. The report of the Post
master-General gives interesting statistics of
his department, and, comparing them with
the corresponding statistics of a year ago,
shows a growth in every branch of the de
partment.
A postal convention lias been concluded
with New South Wales, an exchange of post
al-cards established with Switzerland, and
the negotiations pending for several years
past with France have terminateoj in a con
vention with that country, which went into
eftect last August.
An International Postal Congress was con
vened in Berne, Switzerland, in September
last, at which the United States was repre
sented by an officer of the Postoffice Depart
ment of much experience and of qualification
for the position. A convention lor me estao
lishment of an international postal union was
agreed upon by the delegates of the countries
represented, subject to the approval of the
proper authorities of those countries.
I respectfully direct your attention to the
report of the Postmaster-General and to his
suggestions in regard to an equitable adjust
ment ot the question ot compensation to rail
roads for carrying the mails.
THE SOUTHERN STATES.
Your attention will be drawn to the unset
tled condition of affairs in some of the
Southern States. On the 14th of September
last the Governor of Louisiana called
upon me, as provided by the Constitu
tion and laws of the United States, to
aid in suppressing domestic violence
in that State. This call was made in view of
oroclamation issued on that day by D. B.
Penn, stating that he was elected Lieutenant
Governor in 1872, and calling upon the mili
tia of the State to arm, assemble and drive
from power the usurpers, as he designated
the officers of the State Government. On
the next day I issued my proclama
tion, commanded the insurgents to dis
perse within five days from the date
thereof, and subsequently learned that on
that day thev had taken forcible possession
of the State "House. Troops were sent by me
to support the existing and recognized State
Government, but before the expiration of the
five davs the insurrectionary movement was
practically abandoned, and the officers of the
State Government, witn some minor excep
tions, resumed their powers and duties. Con-
siderinff that the present State administration
of Louisiana had been the only government
in that State for nearly two years; that it Had
been tacitly acknowledged and acquiesced in
as such bv Consrress, and more thau once ex-
nresslv reeoarnized bv me. I regarded it as my
clear duty, when legally called upon for that
purpose, to prevent its overthrow by an armed
mob under nreteiise of fraud and irregularity
in the election of 1872. 1 have heretofore called
the attention of Congress to this subject,
stating that on accotint of the frauds and
forgeries committed at said election, and
because it anneared that the returns theroof
were never legally canvassed, it was impossi
ble to tell thereby who were chosen, but
from the best sources of information at my
command I have always believed the present
State officers received a majority of the legal
votes actually cast at that election. I repeat
what I said 111 my special message ot eb.
1873, that in the event of no action by Con
gress I must continue to recognize the gov
emmnnt heretofore recoiriilzed bv me.
I regret to tav that with the preparations
for the late election a decided indication ap
peared in some localities 111 the Southern
States of a determination, bv acts of violence
and intimidation, to deprive citizens of the
freedom of the ballot because of their politi
cal opinions; bands of men masked aud
armed made their appearance ; White Leagues
and other societies were lormeo ; large quau
tities of arms and ammunition were
imported and distributed to these or
ganizations: military drills, with menac
ing demonstrations, were held, and, with all
these, murders enough were committed to
spread terror among those whose political
action was to be suppressed if possible by
these intolci'atit aild criminal proceedings.
In some places colored laborers were com
pelled to vote according to the wishes of
their employers, under threats 01 a discharge
if they acted otherwise, and there are
too many instances in which: when
these threats were disregarded, they
were remorselessly executed by those by
whom they were made. I understand that
the Fifteenth Amendment to the Constitution
was made to prevent this and the like state
of things, and the act of May, 31; 1870, with
the amendments, was passed to enforce its
provisions, the object of this being to guaran
tee to all citizens the right to vote and to pro
tect tnem in the free enjoyment 01 tnat right;
Enjoined by the Constitution to take care
that the laws be faithfully executed and con
vinced by undoubted evidence that violations
01 said act had been commuted ana tnat a wiae
spread and flagrant disregard of it was con
templated, the proper officers were instructed
to prosecute the offenders, and troops were
stationed, at convenient points to aid these
officers; if necessaiy, in the performance of
their official duties. Complaints are made of
this interference by Federal authority, but if
the said amendment and act do not pi-ovide
for such interference under the circum
stances as above stated then they are
without meaning, force or effect, and the
whole scheme of colored enfranchisement
is worse than mockery and little bet5
ter than a crime. Possibly Congress may
find it due to truth and justice to ascertain,
by means of a committee, whether the al
leged wrongs to colored citizens -for political
purposes are real, or the reports thereof were
manufactured for the occasion.
The whole number of troops in the States
of Louisiana, Alabama, Georgia, Florida,
South Carolina, North Carolina, Kentucky,
Tennessee, Arkansas, Mississippi, Maryland
and Virginia at the time of the "elections was
4,082. This embraces the garrisons of all the
forts from the Delaware to the Gulf of Mexico.
Another trouble has arisen in Arkansas.
Article thirteen of the Constitution of the
State, which was adopted in 1868, and upon
the approval of which by Congress the State
was reetored to representation as one of the
States of the Union, provides, in effect,
that "before any amendments proposed
to this Constitution shall become a
part thereof they shall be passed by
two successive Assemblies and then sub
mitted to and ratified by a majority of the
electors of the State voting thereon." On
May 11, 1874, the Governor convened an ex
tra session of the General Assembly of the
State, which, on the 19th of the same month,
passed an act providing for a convention
to frame a new constitution pursuant to
this act, and at an election held on the
30th of June, 1874, the convention was ap
proved and delegates were chosen thereto,
who assembled on the 14th of last July
and formed a new constitution, the schedule
cf which provided for the election of an
entire new set of State officers in a manner
contrary to the existing election laws of the
State. On the 13th of October, 1874, this
Constitution, as therein provided, was sub
mitted to the people for their approval or re
jection, and according to the election returns
was approved by a large majority of those
qualified to vote thereon, and at the same
election persons were chosen to fill all
the State, county and township offices.
The Governor elected in 1872 for the
term of four years turned over his office
to the Governor chosen under the new Consti
tution, whereupon the Lieutenant-Governor,
also elected in 1872 for a term of four years,
claiming to act as Governor, alleging that
said proceedings by whieh the new Constitu
tion was made and a new set of officers
elected were unconstitutional and illegal and
void, called upon me, as provided -in Section
4, Article 4, of the Constitution, to protect
the State against domestic violence. As
Congress is now investigating the political
affairs of Arkansas I have declined to
interfere. The whole subject of Executive
interference with the affairs of a State is re
pugnant to public opinion, to the feeling of
those who from their official capacity must be
used in such interposition, and to him or those
who must direct. Unless most clearly on the
side of law, 6uch interference becomes a
crime; with the law to support it, it is con
demned without a hearing. I desire, there
fore, that all necessity for Executive direction
in local affairs may become unnecessary and
obsolete.
I invite the attention, not of Congress,
but of the people of the United States,
to the causes and effects of these un
happy questions. Is there not a disposition
on the one side to magnify wrongs and out
rages, and on the other side to belittle
or justify them? If public opinion
could be directed to a correct sur
vey of what exists, and to rebuking
wrong and aiding; the proper authori
ties in punishing it, a better state of feeling
would be inculcated, and the sooner we would
have that peace which would leave the States
free indeed to regulate their own domestic
affairs. .
I believe that on the part of thecitizens of
the Southern States, the better part of them,
there is a disposition to be law-abiding and
to do no violence either to individuals or
the laws existing; but do they do right in
ignoring the existence of violence and blood
shed in resistance to constituted authority ?
I sympathize with their prostrate con
dition, and would do all in my power to
relieve them, acknowledging that in some in
stances they have had most trying govern
ments to live under, and very oppressive ones
in the way of taxation for nominal improve
ments, not giving benefits equal to the hard
ships imposed; but can they proclaim them
selves entirely blamable for this condition ?
They cannot. Violence has been rampant
in some localities, and has further been justi
fied or denied by those who could have
prevented it. The theory is raised that
there is to be no further interference on
the part of the General Government to
protect citizens within a State where
the State authorities fail to give protection.
This is a great mistake. While I remain the
.Executive all tne laws 01 congress ana me
provisions of the Constitution, including the
amendments added thereto, will be enforced
with rigor, with but a regret that tney should
have added one jot or tittle to the Executive
duties and powers. Let there be fairness in
the discussion of Southern questions, the ad
vocates of both or all political parties giving
honest and truthful reports ot occurrences,
condemning the wrong and upholding the
risrht. and soon all will be well. Under exist
ing circumstances the negro votes the
Reoublican ticket because he knows his
friends are of that party. Many a good cit
izen votes the opposite, not because he agrees
with the ereat Tirinciples ot state wnicn sep
arate the parties, but because, generally, he
is opposed to negro rule. This is a most de
lusive cry. Treat the negro as a citizen and a
voter, as he is and must remain, ana soon par
ties will be divided, not on the color Hue, but
on principle. Then we shall nave no com
plaint of sectional interferences.
JUDICIAL AFFAIRS.
The reDort of the Attornev-General contains
valuable recommendations relating to the ad
ministration of justice in the courts 01 the
United States, to which I invite your atten
tion. I resoectfullv suggest to Congress the pro
priety of increasinar the number of the judi
cial districts in tlie United States to eleven,
the present number bemg nine, and the crea
tion of two additional Judgeships. The ter
ritory to be traversed by the Circuit Judges
is so great and the business of the courts so
stead'ilv increasinar that it is growing more
and more impossible for them to keep up
with the. business reauirins- their attention.
Whether this would involve the necessity of
adding two more Justices of the Supreme
Court to the present number I submit to the
judgment 01 congress.
THE INTERIOR.
The attention of Conarress is invited to the
report of the Secretary of the Interior and to
the legislation abked for by him. The domes
tic interests of the people are more intimately
connected with this department than with
either of the other departments of the Gov
ernment. Its duties have been added to from
time to time until thev have become so oner
ous that, without the most perfect sj-stem and
order, it will be impossible for any Secretary
of the Interior to keep trace of all official
transactions having nis sanction ana uoiie 111
his name, and for which lie is held person
ally responsible.
The policy adopted for the management ot
Indian anairs Known as ine peace punt y
has been adhered to with the most beneficial
results. It is confidently hoped that a few
years more will save our frontier from Indian
depredations. I commend the recommenda
tion of the Secretary for the extension of the
Homestead laws to the Indians, and for some
sort of territorial government for the Indian
Territory. A great majority of the Indians
occupying mis lerrnory are ueneveu iu ire
incapable of maintaining their rights against
the more civilized and enlightened men. Any
territorial form of e-overnment jriven them.
therefore, should protect them in their homes
and property for a period of at least twenty
years, and before its final adoption should be
ratined Dy a majority 01 uiose auctwu.
The report of the Secretary of the Interior,
herewith attached, gives some interesting sta
tistical information, which I abstain from giv
ing au abstract of, but refer you to the repor
itself.
PENSIONERS OF THE WAR OF 1812.
The act of Congress providing the oath
which pensioners must subscribe before
drawing their pensions cuta off from this
hountv a few survivors of the war of 1812 re
siding in the Southern Slates. I recommend
the restoration of this bounty to all such
The number of persons whose names would
be restored to the list of pensioners is not
large, xuey are uu oiu persons wiio cuuiu
have taken no part in the rebellion, and the
services for which they were awarded pen
sions were in defense of the whole country.
THE CENTENNIAL EXPOSITION.
The report of the Commissioner of Agri
culture, herewith attached, contains sugges
tions of much interest to the general public
and refers to the approaching Centennial and
the part his department is ready to take In it.
I feel that the nation at large is interested in
having this Exposition a success, and com
mend to Congress such action as will secure
a greater general interest in it. Already
many foreign nations have signified their in
tention to be represented at it. It may be
expected that every civilized nation will be
represented.
THE CIVIL SERVICE.
The rules adopted to improve the civil
service of the Government have been adhered
to as closely as has been practicable with tho
opposition with which they meet. The effect
of it has been beneficial on the whole and has
tended to the elevation of the service; but it
is impracticable to maintain them without the
direct and positive support of Congress.
Generally, the support which this reform re
ceives is from those who give it their support
only to find fault when the rules are
apparently departed from. Removals
from office without preferring charges
against parties removed are frequently
cited as departures from the rules adopted,
and the retention of those against whom
charges are made by irresponsible persons
and without good grounds is also often con
demned as a violation of them. Under these
circumstances, therefore, I announce that, if
Congress adjourns without positive legisla
tion on the subject of " civil-service reform,"
I will regard such action as a disapproval of
the system, and will abandon it. Except so
far as to require examination for certain ap
pointees to determine their fitness, com
petitive examinations will be abandoned.
The gentlemen who have given their ser
vices without compensation as members of
the Board to devise rules and regulations for
the government of the country's civil service
have shown much zeal and earnestness in
their work, and to them, as well as to myself,
it will be a source of mortification if it is to
be thrown away. But I repeat that it is im
possible to carry this system to a success
ful issue Without general approval and as
sistance, and positive law to support it.
THE EMPLOYMENT OF LABOR.
I have stated that the elements of prosper
ity to the nation's capital labor, skilled and
unskilled, and products of the soil still re
main with us. To direct the employment of
these is a problem deserving the most serious
attention of Congress. If employment can
be given to all labor offering itself,"prosperity
necessarily follows. I have expressed the
opinion, and repeat it here, that the first
reauisite to the accomplishment of this
end is the substitution of a sound
currency in place of one of a fluctuating
value. This secured, there are many inter
ests that might be fostered, to the great
rnfit nf hnt.h labor and cn.rtit.al. How to in
duce capital to employ labor is the question.
CHEAP TRANSPORTATION.
The snbieet of chearj transportation has oc
cupied the attention of Congress. New light
on this question will, without doubt, be given
by the committee appointed by the last Con
gress to investigate and report upon this sub.

THE OCEAN CARRYING TRADE.
A revival of ship-building, and particularly
of iron steamshiD buildinir. is of vast impor
tance to our national prosperity. The j
United States is now paying over $1,000,000
pet annum for freights and passage on
oreiaro ships, to be carried abroad and ex
pended in the employment and support of
other people, beyond a fair percentage of
wnat snuuiu go to ioreign vetneis, es ululating
on the tonnage and travel of each re
spectively. It is to be regretted that
this disparity in the carrying trade exists,
and to correct it I would be willing to see
great departure from the usual course
of the Government in supporting what
might usually be termed private enterprise.
would not suggest as a remedy direct sub
sidy to the American steamship lines, but I
would suggest the direct offer of ample com
pensation for carrying the mails between the
Atlantic seaboard cities and the Continent on
American -owned and American-built steam
ers, and would extend this liberality to vessels
carrying the mans to the soutn American
States and to Central America and Mexico,
and would pursue the same policy from
our Pacific seaports to foreign seaports on
the Pacific. It might be demanded that ves
sels built for this service should come up to a
standard fixed by legislation in tonnage,
need and all other qualities, looking to the
possibility of the Government requiring them
at some lime ior war purposes; tue rigut uiso
of taking possession of them in such an
emergency should be guarded.
1 oner these suggestions, Deiievmg tnem
worthy of consideration, in all seriousness,
affecting all sections and all interests alike.
If anything better can be done to direct the
country into a course of general prosperity,
no one will be more ready than I to second
the plan.
DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA.
Forwarded herewith will be found the re
port of the Commissioners appointed under
an act of Congress, approved June 20, 1874,
to wind up the affairs of the District Govern
ment. It will be seen from the report that
the total debt of the District of Columbia,
less securities on hand and available, is: The
bonded debt issued prior to July 1, 1S74,
$8,883,940.43: 3.65 bonds, bv act of Congress
June 20, 1874, $2,088,168.73; certificates of the
Board of Audit, 4,770,oots.4o; total, io, -ia,-667.61
; less special improvement assessments
chargeable to private property in excess
of any demand against such assess
ments, $1,614,054.37; less Chesapeake &
Ohio Canal bonds, $75,000, and Wash
ington & Alexandria Railroad bonds.
$59,000; in the hands of the Commissioners
of the Sinking Fund, $1,748,054.37; leaving
the actual debt, less said assets, $13,994,613.24.
In addition to this there are claims preferred
against the Government of the District
amounting in the aggregate, reported by the
Board of Audit, to S3.147.7S7.4S. ot wnicn tne
greater part will probably be rejected. This
sum can with no more propriety be included
in the debt of the District Government than
can the thousands of claims against the Gen
eral Government be included as a portion of
the national debt; but the aggregate sum
.1 . . .. .1 . ..1 . . .1 ..... ..l,:.w...w,r. 1 1. .1 ,1 4 )l .1
funded debt chargeable exclusively to the
District of Columbia.
The act of Congress of June 20, 1874, con
templates an aDDOrtionment between the
United States Government aDd the District
of Columbia in respect to the payment of the
principal and interest on the 8.65 bonds;
therefore, in computing with precision the
bonded debt of the District, the aggregate
sums above stated, as respects the .bo
bonds now issued, the outstanding cer
tificates of the Board of Audit, and the un
ndinsted claims oendinsr before that Board,
should be reduced to the extent of the amount
to be aDDortioned to the United States
Government In the manner indicated In the
act of Congress of June 20, 1874. I especially
invite vour attention to the recommendation
of the Commissioners of the Sinking Fund
relative to the ambiguity of the act ot June
20. 1874. the interest on the District bonds.
and the consolidation of the indebtedness of
the District.
I feel much indebted to the gentlemen who
consented to leave their private affairs and
come from a distance to attend to the busi
ness of this District, and for the able and sat
isfactory manner in which it has been con
ducted. I am sure their services will be
equally appreciated by the entire country.
It will be seen from the accompanying full
renort of the Board or Health mat tne sani
tary condition of the District is very satisfac
tory. In my opinion the District of Colum
bia should be regarded as the grounds of the
National Capital, in which the entire people
are interested. I do not annoe to tnis to
nrsre e-enerous appropriations to the District,
but to draw the attention of Con
gress, in framing a law for the gov
ernment of the District, to the magnifi
cent scale on which the city was planned by
the founders of the uovernment; the manner
in which, for ornamental purposes, the streets
and avenues were laid out, and what was the
proportion of the property actually possessed
by the General Government. I think the pro
portion of the expenses of the Government
and improvements to be borne by the General
Government and the cities of Washington and
Georgetown and the country should be care
fully and equitably defined.

the Secretary
Treasnrf.
of the
The Secretary submits in detail the receipts and
expenditures for the fiscal year ending June SO,
1874. The aggregates are as follows: Total net
receipts, $332,186,231.29: total available cash,
$45.3.365,563.39 ; total net disbursements. $302,633,

$289,478,756X6; ordinary expenses, - $287433,
878.76; surplus revenue, $2,344,882.30; total
net receipts for the first quarter of
the present fiscal year. $80,84,283.99; total or
dinary expenditures for the same period, $85,313,
489.42"; balance in the Treasury, Sept. 30, 1874,
$ 151.549,599.44; estimated receipts for the remain
ing three-quarters of the year, $203,434,000; esti
mated expenditures for the tame period, $190,
002,(00; estimated total receipts for the current
fiscal year, $284,318,295.99; estimated ordinary
expenses. $275,315,489.42; surplus revenue,
$9,002,796.57; estimated receipts for the
year ending June 80, 1876, $293,000,000;
estimated ordinary expenses for the same period,
$272,778,000; total estimates from the different
executive departments, $310,030,769.89; reduction
of the public debt during the last fiscal year,
$5,762,447.65; total public debt less cash in the
Treasury, $2,139,897,861.27.
The Secretary recapitulates the transactions at
tending the refunding of the public debt, and
states that successful bidders have taken op all
former bids and hold options for the
rest until Feb. 1. He not only takes
strong ground iu favor of specie payments, but
sets forth a definite plan for reaching the same.
He recommends the repeal of the Legal-Tender
act at a fixed day, as to contracts thereafter
made, and except as to official salaries and ordi
nary expenditures of the Government under exist
ing appropriations. The Secretary recommends
that authority be given for the immediate issue
of convertible bonds bearing a low rate of inter
est. He asKs that a day may be fixed for the re
sumption of specie payment, not more remote
than three years, at the end of that time the Sec
retary to he anthoris(ed to raise gold by selling
bonds to such amounts as may become necessary
from time to time to keep the Treasury in condi
tion to redeem greenbacks as presented. It is
recommended that ftactional currency be re
placed by silver, and to accomplish this the Sec
retary desires to set all the mints at work
coining silver, and that as rapidly as It Is pro
duced the fractional currency be recalled and de
stroyed, beginning with the smallest denomina
tions. The Secretary also asks that the coinage
of gold be made free in the United States, as it
is in London, in order to prevent the expor
tation of bullion for coinage. In regard to print
ing all varieties of Government notes, bonds and
stamps, the Secretary recommends that the
whole be done exclusively at the Treasury De
partment. Government has all the necessary '
machinery, obtained at great cost, and all the
needed facilities. It can perform the work
at the same or a less cost than private
firms, when the cost of transportation by ex
press is considered. Aside from these minor con
siderations the Secretary regards the question of
safety as one which should control. At the end
of the present contracts, or as soon as they can
be legally terminated, he recommends that all
the work of this nature be performed in th
printing division of the Treasury.
The Secretary recommends free banking aa
part of the plan for the resumption of anecie
payment, and this branch of the subject is not
elaborated.
Concerning internal revenue, the Secretary
recommends that the tax be taken off bank
checks, matches, cosmetics and drugs, and to
meet this loss an additional tax often cents per
gallon be imposed on whisky. This will raise tho
revenue a little greater than is now received from
the articles enumerated. The practical workings
of putting tea and coffee on the free list have been
fully examined by the Treasury Department. Carefully-prepared
tables of prices in foreign markets
and prices to consumers for a period subsequent
to the taking off of the tax show that, while the
country lost from $6,000,000 to $12,000,000 from the
decrease of revenue on this account, the removal
of the tax simply added to the price in foreign
markets and has not benefited consumers here in
the least.
The attention of Conzress Is called to the ereat
danger to the revenue attending all attempts to
modify the penalties which have heretofore ex
isted, and which the Treasury has sought to en
force. The Secretary is no believer in the sys
tem of moieties, and does no desire its restora
tion in any shape; but he expresses serious
doubts whether any benefit has followed Certain
modifications of, penalties for the violation of
customs regulations.
xne secretary aoes not regara tne .Treasury de
partment as a proper place for the adjudication
of cotton cases. These are for the most part of a
complicated character, requiring the taking of
much evidence and a judicial investigation, lie
therefore recommends that all cotton cases be
withdrawn at once from the jurisdiction of the
Treasury ana turned over to tne courts.
Unon the Question of tariff the Secretary.
without entering upon much discussion, says at
nresent it is onlv necessary to treat it purely as a
question of revenue, and not one either of pro
tection 111 llCtS UM1C. All I llllGICDb Ul
he does not think any changes should be hastily
made, and If Congress desires to revise the
present rates he recommends that a commission
be appointed to take the whole subject Into con
sideration, with instructions to report to the
next Congress.
Great economy is recommended in the expend
itures for public buildings. The Secretary recom
mends that Congress go over the appropriations
and estimates for these works with great care,
with a view of reducing some and wholly sus
pending others, tie expresses tne D-enei mat tne
needs of the Government do not require such
elaborate and costly structures as have of late
been erected, but that plainer, and at the same
time substantial, buildings will answer every
purpose, and save many millions. He thinks
there is needless extravagance in furnishing pub
lic buildings, and that much greater economy
should be practiced in all directions in this mat
ter. He has transmitted the estimates, which
have already been carefully revised, but he ear
nestly -reauests Coneress to unite with him in
scanning them still more closely, with a view to
tneir iurtner reauction.
The force of the department has been re
organized and diminished exactly In accordance
with the laws and appropriations of last session,
but the Secretary thinks the lowest limit of
economy consistent with prompt and efficient
performance of public business has not yet been
reached.
The Secretary does not believe the present con
dition of the Government justifies the extending
of aid m any form to private enterprises of any
kind.
For the vear endins June 30, 1874, the deline In
receipts from customs from the previous year was
considerable falling off from" $188,089,522 to
$163,103,833, a loss of nearly $25,0i0,000. The re
ceipts for the first quarter of the current fiscal
year were $2,500,000 less than for the correspond-

months of October and November, 1873, were
$21,243,333.25. For the same months of the cur
rent year tney were tfioo.on.
It. is certain that the affirresrate amonnt now re
ceived from this source is necessary for revenne
to meet demands, which cannot be safely stated
at less than $160,000,000 in gold, besides the re
ceipts from internal revenue and other sources.
The impost statements for 187-7 show how
neavny tne revenues irom customs were ueineieu

yielded $10,969,098.77 in 1871, and $7,192,074.91

in 1873 the rate of three cents per pound would
