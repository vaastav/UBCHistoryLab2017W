TIES DOWN DKUGUISTS.
Supreme Court Decision In a
Lifiuor Case.
The Michigan supreme court Tues
day handed down a decision that
will be of interest to druggists
throughout tho state. The fsole
question involved was whether
u druggist who sells liquor
to a minor without a writ
ten order from the parents or
guardian of such minor may prove,
by way of defense, I hat, from the
appearance or statements of the
minor, ho believed the latter to be
more than 21 years of age.
The court holds that such dolense
Is not valid, .the statute governing
the salij of liquor to minors contain
no such limitation.
It Is held that intent is not an in
gredient of tho offense, but that,
like many ot'ier jtolice regulations,
this statute Imposes upon the hel
ler tho duty of ascertaining the fact
ut hlft peril.
