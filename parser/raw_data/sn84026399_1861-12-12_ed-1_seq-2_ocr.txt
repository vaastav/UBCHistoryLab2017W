The Iuaugural Address at the begiuing
of the Administration, and the mes-nge
to Coivreas at the lute special sessiou,
were both mainly devoted to the domes
tic ocmtiovcrFj out" of which tho insurrec
tion end consequent war have sprung.
Nothinw now occur? to add or bultracl
to or from tho principles or general pur
poses staled snd pressed in that docii
xnenr. The la-t ray of hope for preserv
ing the Union peaceably, expired at the
msault upon. Fort Sututer, ud a genera
review of v. hat has occurred since way
not be uproOtablc.
What was painfully uncertain then, U
much b. Iter defined nod more distinct
now, aud the progress of events is plaiuh
in the ribt direction. The insurgents
conGdcniYy claimed a strong support from
North of Mason and Dixon's !in , and the
friends of the Uniou were not free from
appreteniion ou that point. This, Low
ever, wasoon a ttlcd dcQuitely and ou
the rL'ht -iJc.
South of the line, noble little jJdawar
led off riht from the first. Maryland
va? made to tcrva against the Union: our
toUicrs ware assaulted, bridge were
burnod, tnd railroads torn up within her
limit, and we were many days at one
time without the ability to bring a sing'c
rogincnt over her foil to tbo capitol.
Now, her bridges and ber railroads arc
repaired and open to the Government

for some time in doubt, is now decidedly,
nnd I think unchangeably, ranged on the
side of the Union. Mis-ouri is corapara
lively quiet, und I believe cannot again
bo overrun by the insurrectionists. These
three States of Maryland. Kentucky, and
Missouri neither of which would promise
a tingle toltiier, at first, have now an ag
cremate of not less than 40,000 in tbe
field for the Union; while of their citizen-',
certainly not more than a third of that
number, and they of doubtful w.herea
bouti and doubtful existence, are in arms
against it. After a somewhat bloody
htrucle of months. Winter closes on the
Union people of Western Virginia, lea?

An iusurgent force of about 1,500, for
monthn dominating tbe narrow peninsular
region eou-t.tuting the Counties of Acco

Eastern Shore of Virginia, together with
home eontiiTUuu parts of Maryland, have
lain dou thur arms, and the people have
renewed their allegiance to and accepted
the protertioo of tho old flag. This

Since your last adjournment, Lieut. -Gen.
Scott has retired from the head of
the arcy. During bis long life, the na
tion hi not been unm'indfui of his merit;
yet, on calling to miud how faithfully, a
bly, and brilliantly he has served the
country from a time far ba-k in our histo
ry when few of the now livin bed been
born, and thenceforward continually, I
cannot but thiuk that wo are till his debt
or. I sul mit, therefore, for your consid
eration, what further mark of recognition
is due to him and ourselves as a grateful
peopje.
With the retirement of Gen. Scott
came the executive duty of Bppointiuj in
his stead a Gcncral-in Chief of the Army.
It ie a fortunate circum-tances that nei
ther in rouncil nor country was there, so
far us I know, any difference of opiniou
as to the proper person to be selected.
The retiring chief repeatedly exprosscd
his judgment in favor of Gen. McClellan
for the position, and in this nation,
seemed to give a onananimous concur
rence. The designation of Gen McCJellon
i-, therefore, in a considerable degree, the
selection of the country an well as of the
Executive, and hence there is better rea
eon to bope there will be given him the
confidence and cordial support thus by
fair implication promised and without
which he cannot, with so full efficiency,
serve the country.
It has been said that one bad General
1 fl nAttif fHntwM n . I .1
-...w fcUUU i uuu
saying is true, if taken to mean no more
than that an army is better directed by a
single mind, though inferior, than by two
superior ones otvariance and cross-purpo-e8.
And the same is true in all joint op
erations wherein those engaged can have
none but a common eud in view and can
differ only as to the choice of means. In
a storm at sea, no one on board can
wieb tbe rbip to sink, and yet not unfre
quently all go down together because too
many will direct, and no single mind can
oe anowea to control. It continues to
develope that the insurrection is largely
if not exclusively a war upon the first
principles of popular government tbe
rights 01 the people. Conclu-ive evidence
oUb is is found in the most rave aod
iratureiy-ccnsidered public documents as
wen as in the general tone of the insuro
in tbese documents, we find the
abridgement of the existing right of suf
frage, and the denial to the people of all
right 10 participate in tbe selection of
pablio officers, exoopt the legislative body
to aTucaa'u wuu lauored arguments to
prove that large control of the Govern
Hient by the people is the source of all po
Ikioal evil. Monarchy itself is sometimes
hinted at as a possible refuge from the
power of the people. In my present po
sition, I could eoorcely be justified were I
to omit raising a warning voice against
this approach of returning despotism.
It is not needed nor fitting here that a
Tcueral argument should bo made in fa
vor of popular institutions but there is
ono point with its connections not bo hack
neyed as mo-t others, to which I ask a
brief attention. It is the effort to place
capital on equal footing with, if not above
labor in the atruoture of the Gorernmcnt.
t i. assumed that labor is available only
in connection -with capital, that nobody
labors unless somebody else owning cap
,tal somehow by the use of it induces him
?o labor. This assumod.it is next con
sidcred whether it is best that capital
shall hire laborers, and thus induce them
to work by their own conncnt, or buy them
and drive them to it without their consent.
Having proceeded so far, it is naturally
concluded that all laborers arc eittier uir
ed laborers or what we call slaves; and
r,.rtli..r it is assumed that whoever is
once a hired laborer is fixed in that con
dition for life. Now there is no such re
lfinn hitween cnnital and labor
-- 4
ns assumed, nor is there any such
thine s a frre man being fixed for life in
" .. . e j it T.l.
tho cnmiitiou oi a uirea lauorer. jjuiu
of thcj-e assumptions arc false, aud ell in
frrnnnes from tbcra are groundless, i-ia-
bor is prior to, and independent of capi
tal. Capital is only tho fruit of labor
1 11 I. . .. I t .1 iflnt-tAt
ana couiu never uayv vauiuu i ,auut
had not first existed. Labor is the
tuperior of capital, and deserves much
tho higher consideration. Capital has its
rights, which arc as worthy ot protection
as any other rigLts. Nor is it denied
tbat there is, and always will be, a rela
tion bttwe n labor nnd capital, producing
mutual bcueGts. The error is in assu
raing that the whole labor of the commu
nity exists within that relation. A few
men own capital, and the few avoid labor
themselves, and with their capital hire or
buy another few to lator for them. A
lar$.c majority belong to neither class
ueithcr work for others, nor have others
working for them. Jn most of the South
em States, a majority of the whole peo
ple of all colors are neither slavss uor
masters, while in tho Northern a large
majority are neither hirers nor hired.
Men with their families wives, ions and
daughters work for themselves on their
farms, in their houses, and in their shops,
taking the whole product to themselves
and asking no favors of capital, on the
one hand, nor of hired laborcrcrs or slaves
on the other. It is not forgotten that a
considerable number of per?ons mingle
their own labor with capital tbat is,
they labor with their own bands, and al
so buy or hire others to labor for them;
but this is only a mixed and not a distinct
clas. No principle stated is distinguish
ed by tbe existence of this mixed class.
Again, as has already -been said, there
H not oi necessity any such tbinir os toe
free hired laborer being fixed in tbat con
dition for life. Many independent men
everywhere in the.-e States a few years
back in their lives were hired laborers
The prudent, penniless regiimer in the
world labors with which to buy tools and
laud for himself, then labors on Lis own
account another while, and at length hires
another new becinner to help him. This
is the just and generous and propcrou
system which opens the way to all, .and
con!-equnt energy and pronre in the
improvement of their condition to all.

TEACHERS OF MONROE COUNTY,
You are hereby requested to meet in tbe
Academy at Stroudsburg, on Saturday,
Dec. 14, at 10 o'clock, A. M., for the
nurnoso of making arrangements to hold
teachers Institutes in every district in this
County.
CIIAS. DET1UCIC,
County Superintendent.
A DUN. Intended for All Who Owe Us.
Our renders will agree with us, that we
are not much given to dunning. Indeed wc
dislike tho practice, and approach it with as
much hesitation asa sick child approachesan
anxious "parient," who is about administer
inf a nnuceous drug. But necessity knows
no compunction ; and as our ooous are 100
much crowded with u o is to render even a
bird!s-cyc view of their puges pleasant, we
are impelled to forgo our dislikes. Delin
quent patron, you ore the very person wc arc
after. You owe us, and we want you to pay
us. We want Wheat, Rye, Corn, Oat
Beef, Pork, Chickens, Turkeys, Geese, Ducks
and many other necessaries and conveniences
0f Jife for we mean to live, and in order to
live well we must have something besides the
wind which God scatters freely and gratui
tously for all. If you have none of these
thinjs on hand, we havo a notion that we
o
would not get mad if you were to tempt u
with money. We have a notion that we
would not refuse even the "filthy lucre"
though it is so long since wc have handled
any that we can form no idea how it would
afTect us to do so. We have a curiosity to
ratifv in this respect! Who will be first to
tempt us to accept money on account of sub
scription, advertising and jobwork ! You
can come with a rush if you please, for we
are fully prepared with beautifully printe
receipts for any crowd that may happen to
come. No one, therefore, need stay back for
foar of intruding upon our time. In the lan
guage of the poet we would say :
"Come onp. come all, these bricks shall flee
From these stout walls so soon as we."
The President's Message.
To the exclusion of our usual variety, we
rive our readers the whole of President Lin
coin's Annual Message. This document pos
sesses the great merit of brevity, and the stil
greater merit of faithfully portraying the
state of the country, and the views of the
President relative to the measures necessary
to prosecute tlie war against reoeliion to a
successful issue. As our readers will doubt
less read the message we forbear further
comment, satisfied that each one who reads
it will agree with us, that as a plain and
truthful State Paper it has never Lren ex
celled by any which have preceeded it.
ICpWe made a hearty breakfast, on Sun
day morning last, off of a most magnificant

refugees represent tbo Union feeling in
tho portion of West Tennessee referred
to as strong and growing; tho people are
jid to be anxious for the arrival of the
National troops, and it was thought tha
a quite genera! uprising would take place
when aid should reaoh that section. The

A Daring Exploit.
Among the many instances where tb

the Boston Gazette is aisost unequalled
Captain Spencer, aid to General Wool
received information from two ladies, who
wcut from Norfolk to Fortress Monroe
with a fia o! truce, tbat near midnight a
cis-oared boat was to lcavo Norfolk for
Richmond with money for the paymen
oi the rebel soldiers. He requested per
mission of Major General Wool to attempt
their capturo, and was told not to place
too much conuden-e in the informa
tion received. Nevetthclcss, pcrmis
sion was given, and selecting too
oarsmen ou whom he could rely, with
their oars muffled, he started at dark and
awaited the eo r,ing of the enemy's boat
lie had preciously given directions to hi
men to pull directly for the boat, and cn
the moment of striking to "back water'
instantly. About midnight the boat wa
heard anproaehini:, aud laliiui: his sta
tion in the bows, with a nine inch she
in his hands, be gave tho ordor to "give
ay. lhe moment his bows utruck tb
rebel boat, he threw the shell into the
middle of it, aud wa- himself drawn back
luckily receiving no injury from the ex
plosion. Not so the boat and occupants
however, the former, of which was broken
in two, and the latter wero scattered in
all directions in the water, not, however
boforo discharging their pisiols at him
two balls going through his cap and three
perforating bis coat. The men were then
told if they submitted quietly they would
ho saved, otherwise he would leave them
to ther fate. They preferred the former
and arming himself with his pistol in one
hand, dirk (taken by him ot tho battle o
Bull Run from a "secesh ) in tho other
ho took them in his boat one by one
handcuffing them as they were pulled in
In addition to which from the stern of tbe
enemy's boat, which floated, ho took 81,
100 in gold and S;".000 in their worthless
paper money. It was with some diffieul
ty ho reached the fort, the gunwale of the
boat being almost level with tbe water
with its increased -weight.

A singular caso is noted in the Cairo
Hospital, among the wounded at Belmont.
Uno man was shot in ths right leg, and
had to have it amputated. Sympathetic

tho knive had severed its fellow a similar
pain was felt. So severe did this become
that tho leg is bandaged nnd treatod as if
itself had been wounded.

articles of food furnished bavo beeu found

very many cases tho ColoncN of regi
ments are partners of tbe sutlers, the pro
fits being so large that men are often un
able to get the appointment upon any oth

conclusively filched from tbe soldiers as
if the sutler were to nut his hands in the

noon, with a quorum iu both Houses, and
immediately proceed to business. Tbe
customary joint commettce was appointed
to wait on the President, and notify him
that they were ready to receive any com
munication he might be pleased to make
and he signified his intention to send in
his message next day. Previous to tbe
adjournment of the Senile. Mr. Trum
bull, of Illinois, gave notice that he will
introduce a bill to confiscate the property
of rebels, and give freedom to pcrsous in
Slave States, and Mr. Wilkinson, of Min
nesota, similar notice of a bill to abolish
the distinction between regulars and vol
unteers. In the IIoue a number of new
members were sworu in, among them Mr.
Maynard, of Tennessee. Th'cre was some
question us to his right to a seat, but it
was explained that he was elected before
tho secession of Tcnnc-ce, and there wa
no further objection. The. cac of ?Jr.
Foster, represented to have been elected
from the Uatteras District of North Car

Elections, as was that of Mr. Segar, hold
a certificate of election from Eastern Yir
ginia. A joint resolution of thanks to
Capt. Wilkes, for hi arrost of Mason and
Slidell, was pa-sed. A resolution was
passed expelling John Reid, member of
the House from the Fifth District of Mis

the Government. Mr. Colfax, of Indiana,
offered a prcair.able and roiolution which
were unanimously adopted, requesting the
President to direct the conQnemcDt of tbe
Rebel Envoy Mason in the coll of a con
victed felon, until Colonel Circoran. shall
bo treated by the rebels as the United
States have treated all prisoner taken by
them on tho battlefield. It wns subse
quently decided to advise the same treat
ment of Slidell, in reference to the im
prisonment of Col. Wood. Mr. Eliot, of
Massachusetts, then offered a series of
resolutions, solemnly declaring that the
war now pending ia simply wagod by tbe
Govrnraon for tha suppression of the
rebellion and the ro-establishmcnt of the
Union, but insisting upon tho right of the
President to emancipnto all persons held
as slaves in any military district in a
state of insurrection against the Govern
ment, and advising such a course Tho
House refused to table tho resolution, 70
against 5o', but its consideration was
postponed for a week. Various other res
olutions ou tho same subject were offered
for future consideration. Oa motion of
uoscoo A. Conkling, of New York, the
Secretary of War was requested to in
form the House whether any step3 had
t. . i- . .
ueen tasen to ascertain who wai rcspon-
blo tor tho disaster at Ball'i Bluff.
(KT'In a paper entitled Feuill de Tbut
le Mond, an explanation is given of a fact
which has puzzled sporting men naruo
ly, why the left barrel of a gun bursts so
much moro frequently than tho right!
The explanation is this: Tho sportsman
on somg out loads both barrels, and on
. .....
seeing a bird rise fires naturally tho right
one; he ro-loa5fi that barrel, arid when he
again, sees a bird or a hare, ho firos a
gain and so ho docs perhaps twenty time
in succession. Each firing gives a shock
to tho ohargo in tho left barrel, and at last
tho succession of shots soparates tho wad
ing from tbo powder and shot tho conso-
quenco is that a vacuum ensues betwecu
tbem aod when the second barroll is dis
charged it frequently bursts. To pre
vent this danger tho recommendotion is
mado that whenever the right band bar
rel is loaded, the charge in tho left baud
one should also bo rammed down. This
ooks reasonable, at all events.

The Heart's Regret.
BY PnOTO.
One year thisaching hearlof mine hath blcdr
Hoping, longing for someting to it lost
One year on elow aud noisolcss wings hatl'
sped
And I upon life's waves am rudely tossed.
The world seems dull and cheerless; and my
heart
May never more he stirred with joys, if
known
Ah could I have fortold how hard to part,
How sad the thought, to feel alone alone!
Vain is the struggle to forget an hour
The heart, the voice, I once thought all
mine own
Too late I feci the magic of thy power
And that through life I must plod on alone
I would that memory could forget its part,
Or time might prove a Lethe to my soul,
But thoughts may not he stilled, so o'er my
heart
They still like waves will ever onward roll.

The Memphis Avalanche, of the 2d,
contains the following:
"A large body of Unioni.-ts attacked
the Confederate forces at Morri.-town,
East Tenne-sce, yesterday, killing a largo
number, and completely routing them.
"Major General Geo. Crittenden ba
arrived at Knoxville, to take command

Zouave Privations.
-Drtc-devil and bare -devil are two
things! Intrepidity suffers from humid
ity and frigidity. Tho funny "Doe.-tick","
who belongi to the "Ellsworth Zouaves,"
thus describes military duty with discour
aging privation-:
"No man has had a whole suit of
clothes for two months. We've
gooe
on
guard dressed oaly in o7crco.it and mus
ket, and wc have done scout duty in tha
easy and elegant attire of a revolver and
one pair of shoes to three men. When
we've wanted to dress extra fine for Sun
day service, we'd poli-b our muskets and
tie a red rig on each leg. The chap
lain, for decency's sake when ho
preaoheB stands in an empty pork bar
rel to hide his legs. I called on the co
lonel yesterday, dressed only in a bayo
net, and that con.-iderato officer admired
my airy costume much, but said I d bet
ter kill a few aeccbers, and when I
bagged one of my own size, I might help
self to his breeches. When our whole
compony lately applied to him for clothes
ho hadu't got any for us, but ho served
out fifteen rounds of ball cartridges to
each, and gave us leave of absccuce for
two days, aud told U3 to bury all tho se
ceshers we killed so as not to lumber up
the couutry. Mo-t of the fellow got
200tl suit of clothes, and Bob Brown
was so uncommonly particular that he
didn't suit himself till he bad killed five
fellows. With ray usual luck, I couldn't
God a fellow my siic they wore all
short ortoo long when at lastl'did find
a fellow five feet nine, and had ju-.t got
a good aim on him, he raised his head
and disoloscd the unwelcome fact that it
was ono of our own "ereants. Jmt my
luck be had on a lovely suit of gray
which would have fitted me to a hair, and
if I'd been half a second quicker on the
trigger, I could have had it, but I
couldn't decently shoot after I'd seen his
face."
Wf3 A rebel farmer, living about ono
mile from Guyaudott, Virginia, a-cer-taiuiug
that a federal soldier had escaped
from the recent mas?acre, took his gun
and went out and shot him. The body
was found by Zoigler's avengers, and on
learning all the circumstances, they pro
ceeded to the scoundrel's house, surroun
ded it, aud took bite out and shot him.
Then ordering h?3 family away, they fired
the building, and stayed long enough tot
sec it completely destroyed.
&a?Dr. D. Lewis recommendi that tbr
basks of all chairs and other scats-bo one
or two inches lower than their fronts, and
that all be lower than tho average gener
ally is. Ho argues, truly, tbat that mode
of sitting is more easy, aod better for tho
spino. The principal fatigue, ia sitting,,
comes from bending, settling, or sliding
forward, and thus straining tbo ligaments,
and muscles in tho small of tho back.
Be suro your seat is low enough not to.
make tho legs weary. Grace, comfort,,
and health would be all promoted by.
theso two reforms in our boats.
