ttle down so near the White House for the
remainer of bia lit. It is the custom among
members of Congress, after their terms expire,
to locate et the capital, open a law
office op a claim agency and proceed to busi-
mess, tut it is not customary among men whe
"b are been elected to the highest office in the
pifs of the people to take any such steps, and as
3lr. Cleveland will undoubtedly be compelled to
earn his living in some manner after the presi
dential term expires, it is hardly thoueht possi-
bia that he can contemplate making Washington
' bis permanent home. Then, too, it would hard
ly do, in the next campaign, to bead the ticket
with GroTer CleTeland, of the District of Colum
bia, as there is a feeling prevalent among people
generally that a eitizenshio of the District of
Colombia amounts to very little politically, and
it is hardly likely that a candidate hailing; from
f that section cf the country would meet with as
hi nch support, even among hia own party, as one
who claimed a residence in one of the States.
This is doubtless the animus of the articles
whieh are now being published by Mr. Cleve
land's supporters, to make it appear that he is
still a re&ident of the city of Buffalo.

15LAIKK A5D CLEVELAND.
Their Views Do Xot Meet Universal Approval
In 12 it her Tarty.
jtVsshlogton Special.
If an open and unequivocal fight is to be made
for the free-trade or tariff -for-revenue principle
some of the Republican free-traders may think
it worth their pains to rebel against the high
tariff domination of Mr. Blaine and other lead
ers. At tbe same time there are many Demo
crats who think that Mr. Cleveland has made a
mistake. This opinion is not confined to Mr.
Kendall and bis following. Even some of those
who applauded enthusiastically when the mess
age was read, and who are in thorough sym
pathy with the principles ar.d arguments set
forth, are doubtful about its practical effect.

; presidential campaign he should have waited a
; few months. A prime prerequisite to Demo-
cratic victory at tbe next presidential election is
' an appreciable reduction of taxation by the pres
ent Congress. There ought to be a seduction of
??0. 000,000 or $100,000,000, but the people will
not baeven temporarily satisfied with a decrease
f lees than $40,000,000 or $501,000,000.
''The surplus is a monster which threatens to
ftartle the whole eountry into a panic If the
House passes a bill in line with the President's
message, it will not pass the Senate, There will
hit no reduction of taxation and no means of
patting into the business of tbe country the
millions of money accumulating in the treasury
vaults, and the Democratic party will be held
responsible and rebuked at tbe people's tribunal,
tbe polls.
"The spirit of compromise as abroad, but
Mr. Cleveland did not meet it. He listened to
advice and then astonished bia advisers by doing
as he pleased. Even Mr. Cariude must have
been amazed. All the wise outgivines from the
Oakview and other conferences have been made
to look silly. Even CoL Alex. McClures power
ful dispatch few weeks ago after he had seen
'the Fresident would be as fnnny as a eomla
r.lmacac printed parallel with the President's
Xisssage. '
''The President ought to have restrained him
relf and fallen in tbe enrrent idea of compromise,
itcd then, after Congress bad arrested tbe
rorplns, be might have sent in bis low tariff or
free-trade meseace as a slogan for the cam-
sign."
That is one view of the ease, and it is impor
tant to note the fact that there is a division of
sentiment abont Mr. Blaine's interview as well
as ahnut Mr. Cleveland's message.
"Why," say some of.the commentators, "Mr.
33! sine should not try to discuss American poli
ties from Europe. He doesn't seem to know
rrhat is going on. As a sop to the temperance
nr.d moral element he declares in favor of keep
ing the tax on whisky, though his Republican
friends here, and some of the Democrats, are
getting ready to wipe that out, so they will not
hav to disturb the tariff.
"Mr. Blaine's platform is to keep up tbe tax
on whisky and preserve the tariff in all its
enormity, and spend the money that rolls into
the Treasury. His prooosition to distribute
some of it among the Statea is an absolute
"beresy. It is simply a step toward paternal and
centralized government at Washington. In his
urgency of coast defenses, he adroitly refers to
the letter of Samuel J. Tilden, one of the saints
of Democracy."
Tilden's letter, by the way, did not meet with
: a torro of approval. It was intended to be in
corporated in the President's message, but Mr.
''Cleveland did not propose to be run by aome-
l.fdy else, or to nave it go forth that any portion
of his message was dictated by even so distin
' guished a Democrat as Samuel J. Tilden.
FABM PRODUCTS.
Average Taloe of Wheat, Corn, Oats, Bar
ley, Buckwheat and Bay.
' ' Washington, Dec 10. The December sta
tistical report of the Department of Agriculture
relates mainly ta farm prices of agricultural
products. The average value of corn is 43.3
cents per bushel, as against 36.6 last year, and
28 in 1883. In 1831 it was 618. when
' 4h estimated nrodnct was 1,194.916.000
bushels. The difference is largely
due to a general depression of
values. The prices, respectively, in 1881 and
1E37, are 61 and 48 in Ohio. 60 and 45 in Indi
ana, as ana 11 in minoi. nua in xow, w
' and 37 in Missouri. 58 and 37 in Kansas, and 39
. and 30 in Nebraska. Prices in tbe Gulf Statea
average lower than last year, resulting from a
' nearly full home supply. In the Atlantic States
'prises of home-grown corn are only slightly ad
vanced. The average value of wheat is 69 cents, only
3 mills higher than the average last year. It is
'22 in New York, 81 in Pennsylvania, 74 in
Michigan. 73 in Ohio, 72 in Indiana, 70 la
Illinois, 64 in Wisconsin, 62 ia Missouri, 61 In
Iowa and Kansas. 5'J In Minnesota, 53 in
Nebraska and 52 in Dakota.
The averaee for oata is 30.7c, against 2&8e
last year. Barley averages 52.2a, instead of 53c
last year. Buckwheat, 56.1c, or l.To higher
than last year. The cereal averages for tbe en-
- tire country differ very slightly from those of
last year, except as to corn. Tbe value of bsy
is much increased. It averages $9.34 per ten,
against $7.36 last year. The advance has been
in the drought area of the West.

Washington. Dec. 10. There wis a little
erowd of , delegates to the National Republican
, convention' gathered in the lobby cf the Arling
ton last night. Among them was Mr. John B.
Lawson, the veteran delegate of New York.
They were talking about the sizes of the differ
ent States aod Territories, when Mr. Lawson
surprised everyone by saying with every appear
ance of seriousness that tbe town of Sitka,
Alaska, waa the center of the territorial belong
ings of the United States, north, south, east
and west, within ten or fifteen miles. The other
members of tbe gronp looked at Mr. Dawson as
. if doubting his sanity. "If you do not believe
me, gentlemen," said that worthy, with beaming
complacency, "just look at this map and at
these figures," and he produced a map of the
Western hemisphere. ''From this you will see
that Alaska runs up to the Arctic ocean, and the
distance from Sitka to the Arctic is almost ex
actly tbe same as the distance from Sitka to tbe
Mexican border. From Sitka to the coast of
Maine is no more than from Sitka to the
furthest of the Aleutian islands, which are our
property. You did not know what a big place
Alaaka was. did youF and still smiling com
placently, the old gentleman returned the map
to his pocket. -

FATAL COAL-MINE ACCIDENT.
Two 3In Instantly Killed and Two Badlj
Mangled and Fatallj Crashed.
Wi TjKesb arre, Dec. 10. A report has just
reached here of a frightful accident at Luzerne
borough, four niilea from here. The carriage
at Waddell's shaft, used for hoisting coal, was
about to be lowered into the pit, 300 feet deep.
Upon it were ten miners. When -within 100
feet of the bottom, the carriage became sta
tionary and the rope began to slacken. Before
the engineer could take up the slack, the car
riage suddenly descended with great force,
throwing four of the men off, who fell to the
bottom of the pit. James John and Hugh
Monaghan were horribly mangled and instantly
kill ad. William Boyd and John Blight were
picked up fatally injured- The legs and arms
of each were broken in several places, and they
were badly crushed. The six others were
seriously injured and badly shaken up, but
their injuries are not considered fatal.
A Multitude of Heirs.
Special to the Indianapolis Journal
Tipton, Ind.. Dee. 10. Since the Journal took
the pains to investigate the Buohanan estate and
give the important facts relative to the matter, new
heirs are being discovered all over the State. The
O'Banions at this place have received no less than
twenty-five fetters from parties who read the state
ment and are inquiring after the matter. Yesterday
an old gentleman living in Hamilton county called
on I. M. O'Banion, armed with an Indianapolis
Journal of Monday's issue, and said his name was
Buchanan, and that he would come in for a share of
the wealth. Letters received to-day from S. P.
Morgan, an attorney of Grcencastle, Kr, who is now
in New York looking after the matter, state that
commissioners will soon be appointed before whom
the heirs can go and prove thtir heirship, and that
arrangements are being made for tbe appointment of
a receiver for the lands. Ue also sent blanks for the
heirs at this place to fill out.
Imposition Upon Worklogmen.
St. Loris. Dee. 10. The Globe-Democrat to-day
prints an article to the effect that thousands of la
boring men are sent from St. Louis to points in the
South and Southwest by the various labor bureaus or
employment agencies, to starve, and that paper eites
two places Helena, Ark., and Carter county, Missouri,
where contractors have forces at work, to which
places the men are sent wit h promises of plenty of work
and (rood pay. Men who have been able to get back
say that there is not enough work for one-half of the
men and that most of the men are in a starving con
dition, many of them being compelled to sell their
clothing to buy food. The contractors take advantage
of this misery "to reduce wages. Inquiry at the agen
cies show that many laborers are being sent to these
points daily, notwithstanding the fact that there is no
work. The agents say that they have orders for the
men and are oheying instmctions. The Globe-Democrat
acnses the agents and contractors of being in
collusion.

THE COUNCIL OF CHUECHMEN
A Very Readable Sketch of the Kecent
Conference at the National Capital.
Representative Character of the Assemblage
The Great Ability of the Speakers and
Importanca of Topics Discussed.
Correspondence of the Indianapolis Journal.
Washington, D. C, Dec. 9. The impression
deepened as tbe conference proceeded that it
was, in all respects, one of the most important
religious gatherings of the decade. No evangel
ical ehurcb was without its representatives, and
all of tbe churches sent some of their ablest men.
On tbe platform bishops claiming apostolie suc
cession jostled bishops whom they would not
admit to be such, and men of other denomina
tions fully as worthy of tbe episcopate as any to
wbom this high dignity attached, while on the
floor were to be seen, at all times, a full thou
sand of the very flower of all the eccesiastical
circles in tbe Nation. One could tell at a glance
thatitjwasa body abounding in distinguished
rnenfor whatever there may be, or may not be,
in a name, there is surely a great deal in looks,
and if the clerical garb was not as conspicuous
as one might have expected, it was easy to dis
cover in the features of the delegates both their
high calling and their exalted intellectual and
moral character.
The papers and speeches were inevitably of
tbe first order of merit. Each spoke upon his
pet theme, and nearly all who took part were
men of national repute. Candor com pels tbe
admission, too, that the speakers, with few ex
ceptions, carried tbe interest and awakened the
enthusiasm of the great audiences. Naturally
some striking contrasts were presented. To bear
Presideat McCosh, wrinkled, feeble and fully
ripe in both years and scholarship, but still an
intellectual giant and almost a transfigured ora
cle, was a rare treat. His theme waa ''The Re
lation of tbe Church to Capital and Labor,"
and bis chief points were that the church and
the ministry must get nearer to the masses,
and, as he did when in tbe pastorate thirty-five
years ago. must get near to them by going
after them and preaching the gospel, Paul
like, from house to house. And if this was a
treat, no less so was the faultless speech of
vigorous manhood which followed (one of the
very best the conference listened to) from Hon.
Seth Low. of Brooklyn, who, while taking a
hopeful view of the relations between capital
and labor, still held that the church had a great
duty in the premises, and was not backward
in suggestions as to how her high missions
might be fulfilled.
Sue must see to it. first, that the capitalists
in her own fold did not oppress the hireling in
bia wages. She must insist that the wace
workers were not so many hands, but were liv
ing, human beings. She must teach tbe great
doctrine of a common brotherhood, and must
take care that the mouths in her pulpits were
not stopped by gags of gold sentiments which,
of course, brought forth round after round of
applause, though in some quarters they must
have hit pretty hard,
Tbe most delicate, and possibly, the most im
portant topics were "The Perils of the Family"
and "The Social Vice," handled resonctively
and with consummate skill by Rev. S. W. Dike,
of Massachusetts, and by Colonel Green, of
Hartford, Conn. France, it was shown, was the
only European nation whose birth rate was as
low as that of this eountry, and what made our
situation worse than hers was that she was con
cerned about this matter while we were not.
Tbe divorce rate is double what it was twenty
years ago both in America and Europe. In en
lightened New England 2,000 divorces had been
cranted in a single year, and nearly as mauy
bad blackened the record of the State of Ohio in
a year.
Mormonism, it was contended, did not
threaten half tbe mischief that our easy divorce
laws did. Touching the social vice, Colonel
Greene contended that what was done openly
by those lost to shame was but a small part,
and not the vilest part either, of what was
going on. Amongst the corrupting influences
at work upon children and youth he men
tioned, first in the order of time, the promis
cuous association of the good and bad in the
publio schools, the work too often begun
there being supplemented afterwards by
tha novel, the sensational nnwspaper, the
obscenity lurking under the guise of art, the
saloon, and tbe loose moral code prevailing
in society. His plea waa for a general support
of the White Cross movement as an antidote to
this social vilenesa, in which he was ably sup
ported by Dr. Thomas, an eminent physician of
Baltimore. Dr. Thomas held that there were
more pure men in America than in any other
nation, and that the great need was for those
believing in purity to put themselves on record.
Tbe dividing wedges of this otherwise har
monious conference have been temperance and
Roman Catholicism. The papers on the former
subject did not half satisfy the advanced think
ers on the question, and there was no end of
subdued muttering in some quarters. That,
however, was only what might have been antici
pated, and, ia fact, it was anticipated and pro
vided against, and by a cut-and-dried pro
gramme which left discussion entirely at the
option of the chair and utterly shut off all reso
lutions. As to Catholicism, there were numerous al
lusions to that church and numerons demonstra
tions, more or less condemnatory of her action
in certain directions on tbe part of the audience,
from the time tbe conference opened, but the
first formal address on the subject was by
Bishop Coxe, of the Protestant Episcopal Church.
His theme "was ultramontanism. The bishop
conceded the Christian character of the masses
of both priests and people, but entered a strong
protest against the allegiance of American Cath
olics to a foreign power, and against tbe inter
ference of that power with American institu
tions. Dr. J. M. King, of New York, followed in
much' tbe same strain, conceding all that the
Bishop did, but protesting even more vigorously
than the Bishop aeainst the government of
American citizens by Rome. Both were loudly
applauded, the latter especially so when, in a
few terse sentences, delivered with genuine
Methodist unction, he declared that the Ameri
can people would never consent to share with
Catholics the publio school fund. Tbe
sequel came tbe day following. The
questions of divorce and the social evil
were under consideration, and a qniet-lookiug
man, Prof. Simeon E. Baldwin, of New Haven,
Conn., took the platform to enter a protest, as
be said, against tbe spirit of hostility shown in
the conference to Catholics, the fact being, he
held, that in social reform movements that
; church might be made a valuable ally, and, in
fact, was such, as he and other workers in vari
ous causes could attest from personal knowl
edge. This was in the nature of a bomb-shell in the
proceedings. Many showed unmistakable signs
of dissent from the gentleman's remarks, but a
considerable number applauded, tbe scene beinc
ended by a quiet, reassuring speech from
President Dodge, of the Alliance, who depre
cated the idea that the conference was opposed
to the Catholic Chorch as a church, and held
tf the opposition shown was merely against
icertain tendencies and demands of tbe comma
SnLoj) which were held to be un-American.
rif, however, there were a few points of disa
greement in the body, there were, to offset
these, many points in which all, obviously, saw
eye to eye and felt the thrill of a common emo
tion. None dissented from the proposition tha
more must be done for our great cities, or that
immigration ought to be brought under judi
cious control, or that wealth should be more
generally used to bless tbe needy, or that the
church must come closer to the masses, or that
tbe saloon was an infinite and intolerable curse,
or that domestio and personal purity are too
uncommon, or that the capital and labor prob
lem can find its peaceful and final solution only
on a New Testament basis of human brother
hood. None dissented from the proposition nor from
the necessity, as laid down so ably by Dr. Storrs,
Dr. Gladden, Bishop Harris. Dr. Strone. Dr.
SchaufSer. Professor Post. Rev. Frank Rusiel
and others, that to meet these woes and needs
of the country tbe churches, without sacrificing
their individuality, must co-operate more fully,
so as to make the most of their resources, and
present an unbroken front to the enemy. Doubt
less, too, all who were present went away with
a determination to work in their several spheres
to bring about this desired union of forces.
Undoubtedly, too, tbe conference will reaeh and
influence for good a still wider circle by means
of the book whieh is to appear shortly, contain
ing verbatim the whole of its interesting pro
ceedings. Socially the delegates had a grand time. There
were few who had not some friends here, and
not many but bad one or two invitations to vary
hotel life by occasional tenders of private hosni
tality. President and Mrs. Cleveland, in addi
tion to the general reception they held, gave sev
eral private parties and the lady of tbe White
Hocsa lent eclat to the proceedings of the con-.
ference by occasional attendance at its sessions.
Many other residents gave sumptuous dinners
to special guests every evening.
Among these none entertained more royally
than tbe Rev. Sam W. Small, who is domiciled
here, with bis charming family, in a handsome
and finely-furnished residence, and the great
contrast in whose life within the last two years
was forcibly emphasized by the presence at his
table one day of Judge Stewart, of Atlanta,
now a Congressman, who, as Small himself re
minded bia guests, bad repeatedly bad occasion,
when judge of the Superior Court in the city
above named, to order Small, who was court re
porter at the time, to show cause before him
why he should net be eommittted for contempt
in conseqnence of being too intoxicoted to at
tend to bis duties. A rare man this Sam Small,
both intellectually and socially, and as to his
conversion, one of the miracles of the nine
teenth century.
There is something funny in the most sedate
of assemblies, and preachers, it is well known,
are as fond of a good langh, almost, as of the
proverbial yellow legs. V'nat furnished peren
nial comedy for the body were the ever-recurring
bell tape by which- speakers were called to
time. Few Quit soon enough to escape this
tantalizing reminder,, and some Kept on in spite
of it until the audiences fairly roared. Charity
compels the thoueht that some were deaf, at
least in one ear, but when the bell proved utter
ly hopeless the coat talis were resorted to.
"Another important point for us to consider
is" said one long-winded speaker, and tap
went Dr. Strong's gentle reminder, which re
minds me of the important point that the time
has come to close this letter. H. T.

Charlie Ilosa Fonnd Again.
ERIE, Dec. 10. The story of the Charlie Ross kid
n aping was revived here to-day by one S. G. Sellers,
who came here from Mitchell, Canada, for the sake of
petting a meeting with Mr. Ros6, of Philadelphia.
Sellers states that twelve years ago a family came to
Mitchell from Philadelphia with a small boy whose
appearance impressed him after having seen a wax
figure of the lost Charlie Ross in ForepauRa's circus.
Recently tho head of the family from Philadelphia
was killed in an accident. During the wife's grief she
confessed that she and her husband were the custodi
ans of the kidc aped boy. Realizing the position she
had placed herself in, she subsequently denied her
former statement. Sellers is so deeply impressed
that he sent forward to Charles Ross's father a state
ment of the facrs to-day, and is quite positive that he
has unearthed the long-sought child.

IVES IN CHICAGO.
He Says lie Ia Fully Prepared to Meet Any
tkingiQ tha Lino of Criminal rrosecation.
Chicago, Dec 10. Henry S. Ives made a
somewhat mysterious visit to Chicago, yester
day, registering at a hotel as "Henry Ironton,"
and his attorney, barrister Boone, registering
as "H. S. Booming." Mr. Ives used the great
est discretion in his attempt to prevent his
presence being known, but finally admitted
that the United States Court at Indianapolis
had issued an order restraining President JIc
Keen, of the Terre Haute & Indianapolis Rail
road Company, from disposing of the stock of
that company which was held as collateral to
secure the payment of a note of $669,000 given
by him. It was alleged that the note he had
given was signed by him as a trustee, and Mr.
Ives said that he simply acted as trustee in that
transaction, and therefore signed in his official
capacity. He did not think there would be any
individual trouble accruing to himself, but he
was sorry to learn that McKeen had got himself
into any difficulty on his account. He hoped to
secure an extension of time in the pending
litigation, and if that was granted he would
make everything straight, lie denied that he
bad stripped the treasury of the Cincinnati,
Hamilton & Dayton Railroad Company of its
available cash, last June, but asserted that he
had paid to the treasurer of the company over
$600,000 to meet claims against him. He claimed
that the directors should see that he was feept
harmless against any suits that might be
brought against him. ne was not afraid of any
criminal prosecution, and defied any one to
afiix any culpable or financial responsibility to
him on account of his connection with the Cin
cinnati, Hamilton & Dayton Railroad, lie said
he was perfectly prepared to meet all his ac
cusers, but he mignt want a little more time in
order to collect his facts, summon his witnesses
and properly arrange his defense.
The B. & O. Presidency.
Baltimore, Dec 10. The directors of the Balti
more & Ohio railroad elected Mr, Samuel Spencer
president, and his salary, it is understood, was fixed at

Robert Garrett, was $14,00O. After the election of
Mr. Spencer the resignation of Thomas M- King, sec
ond vice-president, was presented. The terms of the
consolidated mortgage were then read. The directors
declined to speak of what had been transacted other
than of tbe election cf the president and the resigna
tion of Mr. King.

GOVERNMENT TERRORISM IN RUSSIA.
Horrible Outrages Perpetrated on Innocent
Men and Women How Nihilists Are Made.
George Kennan, In December Century.
When General Strelnikoff was intrusted by
the Tsar with almost dictatorial power in order
that he might extirpate sedition in the provinces
of southern Russia, he arrested and threw into
prison in the single city of Odessa no less than
118 persons in three days. He then went to
Kiey and arrested eighty-nine persons almost
simultaneously, and ordered the imprisonment
of hundreds of others in Kharkhoff, Nikolaief,
Pultava, Kursk, and other South Russian cities.
Most of these arrests were made entirely with
out what is known as a "probable cause," and
for the solo purpose of obtaining clews to plots
which the polico believed to exist, but which
they had not been able to discover. Many of
the persons arrested were mere children im
mature schoolboys and girls from fifteen to sev
enteen years of age who could not possibly be
regarded as dangerous conspirators, but who
might, it was thought, be terrified into a con
fession of all they knew with regard to the
movements, conversations and occupations of
their older relatives and f riend3.
Gerieral Strelnikoff's plan was to arrest simul
taneously a large number of persons belonging
to the "untrustworthy" class; throw them into
prison, keep them for ten days or two weeks in
the strictest solitary confinement, and then sub
ject them to a terrifying inquisitorial examina
tion, with the hope of extorting scraps of in
formation, here a little and there a little, which
might be pieced together, like the parts of a dis
sected map, so as to reveal the outlines of a rev
olutionary plot. If, for example, a young girl
belonged to an "untrustworthy" family, and a
"suspicious" letter to her had been intercepted
by the authorities; or if she had been seen com
ing out of a "suspicious" house at a late hour in
the evening, she was arrested in one of these
police raids, generally at night; conveyed in a
close carriage to the Odessa prison; put into a
solitary confinement cell and left to her own
agonizing thoughts. No explanation was given
her of this summary proceeding, and if she ap
pealed to the sentry on duty in the corridor, the
only reply she obtained was, "Prikazano ne
gavarit' "Talking is forbidden." The effect
produced upon a young, inexperienced, impress
ible girl, by the overwhelming shock of such a
transition from the repose, quiet and security of
her own bedroom, in her own home, to a narrow,
gloomy cell in a common criminal prison at
night, can readily bo imagined. Even if she
were a girl of courage and firmness of character,
her self-control might give way under the strain
of such au ordeal. The sounds which break the
stillness of a Russian criminal prison at night
the stealthy tread of the guard; the faintly
heard criee of a drunken and disorderly "casual,"
who is being strapped to his bed in another part
of the prison, cries which suggest to an inex
perienced girl some terrible scene of violence
and outrage; the occasional clang of a heavy
door; the moaning and hysterical weeping of
other recently-arrested prisoners in cells on the
same corridor, and the sudden and noiseless ap
pearance now and then of an unknown human
face at the little square port-hole in the cell door
through which the prisoners are watched all
combine to make the first night of a young girl
in prison an experience never to be forgot
ten while she lives. This experience, however,
is only the beginning of the trial which her
courage aud self-control are destined to under
go. One day passes two days three days
ten days without bringing any news from the
outside world, or any information concerning
the nature Of' the charges made against her.
Twice every twenty-four hours food is handed to
her through the square port-hole by the taciturn
guard, but nothing else breaks the monotony and
the solitude of her life. She has no books, no
writing materials, no means whatever of divert
ing her thoughts or relieving the mental strain.
which soon becomes almost unendurable. Tor
tured by apprehension and by uncertainty as to
her own fate and the fate of those dear to her.
she can only pace her cell from corner to corner
until she is "exhausted, and then throw herself on
the narrow prison bed and in sleep try to lose
consciousness of her misery.
At last, two weeks after her arrest, when her
spirit is supposed to be sufficiently broken by
solitary confinement and grief, she is summoned
to the dopros, a preliminary examination, with
out witnesses or counsel, conducted by General
Strelnikoff in person. He begins by saying that
she is "charged withvery serious crimes under
such and such sections of the penal code, and
that she stands in danger of exile to Siberia for
a long term of years. In view, however, of her
youth and inexperience, and of the probability
that she has been misled by criminal associates,
he feels authorized to say to her that if she will
show repentance, and a sincere desire to reform,
by making a 'cristoserdechni' 'clean-hearted
confession' and will answer truthfully all ques
tions put to her, she will be immediately re
leased. If. on the contrary, she manifests an
obdurate disposition, and thus proves herself to
be unworthy of clemency, it will become his
duty, as prosecuting officer of the crown, to
treat her with all the rigor of the law."
The poor girl is well aware that the reference
to Siberian exile is not an empty threat. Be
longing as she does to an "untrustworthy fam
ily, she has often heard discussed the case of
Marie Prisedski, who was exiled before she was
sixteen years of age because she would not be
tray her older sister, and the case of the Iviteh
evitch children, one seventeen and the other
fourteen years of age, who were arrested in
Kiev and sent to Siberia in 1879 for no particu
lar reason except that their two older brothers
were revolutionists and had been shot dead
while resisting arrest.
It is not a matter for surprise if a young girl
who has thus been torn from her home, who is
depressed and disheartened by solitary confine
ment, who is without counsel, without know
ledge of the law, without the support of a single
friend in this supreme crisis of her life, breaks
down at last under the strain of deadly fear,
and tells the inquisitor all she knows. She is at
once released, but only to suffer agonies of self
reproach and remorse as she sees her relatives
and dearest friends arrested, imprisoned, and
exiled to Siberia upon information and clews
which she herself has furnished. It frequently
happens, however, that a girl remains steadfast
and refuses to answer questions even after
months of solitary confinement. The authori
ties then resort to other and even more discred
itable methods.
A WESTERN KICKING MATCH.
The Man Who Out-KJcked m Vicious and
Ueavy-Ueeled Burro.
San Francisco Alt a.
In the early days of Dutch Flat, a large
boned and gigantic Indianian was known to this
rough but kindly associates as "Kicking Tom."
He had won the nickname by reason of the
terrific force with which he could launch his
great sinewy foot against an opposing object.
He was, besides, as lithe and springy as a
panther. In those days men were not very par
ticular about the character of their amusements,
although nothing mean or underhand ever took
place among them. Their rough courtesy was
genuine and hearty, and they were as brave as
Norman barons or Paladins of France. They at
times had little regard for human life, but in
their deadly affrays they took the lion and not
the hyena for their model. They admired cour
age and strength, because these were qualities
which came every day into requisition, and
without them there was neither peace nor safety
in the then lawless realm of the gold-seekers.
Among these pioneers of the wilderness
Kicking Tom had grown into universal popular
ity. He was generous, brave and kindly, and
wnat perhaps endeared him to his associates
more than anything else, he was always fore
most in the rough sports of tho camp. He was
ever ready for fun and frolic, and it was a matter
of supreme indifference to him whether this took
the form of pleasant episodes or rough fighting.
He exemplified the old adage that "it is just as
good to fight as to eat," One day a miner
brought into camp a Mexican burro, which soon
obtained a wide celebrity as a vicious animal,
who, when excited, would attack man or beast
with desperate fury. Several mountain ponies
had been kicked to death by him, and more than
one man had nearly lost his life by the savage
heels of the brute. So exciting had become the
record of the jack's achievements that they be
came the subject of universal conversation and
inquiry among the miners. Sitting in their
cabins, they spun wonderful tales of what he
had done aud was capable of doing.
"He is the liveliest kicker in tho world," said
one.
Tou are right, old man. That beast can
kick the hair off a man's head without touching
the skin," replied one pf his companions.
This was touching Tom in a tender place, and
after a moment's reflection he spoke up with the
remark:
"He can't out-kick me." The observation was
received by the group in amazed silence,
"Lord, Tom! Why, he'd make mince-meat of
you in a minute."
"Would hel" replied the athletic Indianian.
"Then he can have the chance. I'm ready to
kick for $100, and may the best man win."
"Or the best Jack," laughingly interposed a
companion. . r
"I mean what I say, old man, so don't be too
spry with your tongue." And Tom's brows
lowered in gathering anger. His friend apolo
gized for the jest and the crowd dispersed for
the night.
The next dav the rumor went wild through
tho camp that Tom was willing to kick the burro
for a wager. In the dusk of the evening the
miners gathered in from their work and dis
cussed the subject in all its bearings. Opinion
as to the match was about evenly divided. It
anything, Tom was the favorite. Under these
circumstances a mill for $100 as side was easily
arranged between the beast and the man, and
it was decided that the conflict should come off
on the next Sunday afternoon.
Promptly at the appointed hour every inhabi
tant of Dutch Flat was assembled in a little
level just outside the limits of the camp. The
preliminaries were quickly arranged and the
fight began. The beast seemed to take in the
situation at a glance and laying back his ears he
watched his wary opponent witk angry eyes.
Suddenly Tom leaped forward and landed a
terrific "kick squarely on the junction of the
neck end head. The brute reeled before the
force of the blow, but recovering on the instant
he wheeled and launched both lieel3 at his an
tagonist The man leaped aside, and as quick
as lightning responded with ' another fearful
kick in the burro's neck. And so the conflict
raged. Sometimes the jack would get in a sav
age blow on his opponent, but of tener the man
had the best of it, and at last putting forth all
his wonderful strength he landed a kick with
the fury and irresistible force of a pile-driver on
the jack's neck, which had been his objective
point from the beginning. The beast reeled
back and with a convulsive quiver fell over dead.
Tom was terribly bruised, but no bones were
broken, and in a few days he was as spry a3
ever.
The miners next day gave the jack a regular
funeral. Amid all the pomp and circumstance
of the camp he was laid to rest underneath the
sod of tbe valley, aud a local poet thus canonized
his memory:
Lay his waxen hoofs together,
Fold back his long andspr eading ears,
For be has gone to blend his geehaw
With the music of the spheres.
Carter Harrison's Bath In Japan.
Chicago Mail.
Then one of the girls tells us the bath is ready.
We undress and put on a rob e. A girl shows us
to the bath room. It is down stairs, and has
only an open Japanese serene to shut off the gaze
of the habitues of the house. The tub is a
round vat about four feet deep. You put your
foot in to try the temperature. The foot at
once takes the hue of a boiled lobster. You
nearly shriek. The girl laughs and empties a
pail of cold water in. You then wait for her
to go out She does not budge. You can't, to save
you, think of Japanese enough to tell her to git.
Finally, by a lot of awkward signs you get her
beyond tho screen. But not an inch further.
There she stands and waits, as innocently as did
good old Eve when Adam poured into her will
ing ears his first declaration of undying affec
tion. There are things that try men's souls and call
for heroic courage. One can scale the bristling
wall, can march into the mouth of a hot-throated
cannon, can mount the scaffold with the shining
ax glistening in the sun, can tell the girl he
loves how ho would win and wed her, can
make a maiden speech in the House of Represen
tatives. But these are easy tasks compared to
that of getting into a hot bath with a pretty
Japanese girl looking at you through a rattan
screen looking at you, too, with as much sang
froid as if she was seeing a three months old
baby stripped of its little flannel shirt
Finally patience gives out, you drop your robe
and jump in. Good heavens, the pail of cold
water did cool the thing, but the furnace is still
adding caloric. You feel much as did the poor
Japanese martyrs, when, a few hundred years
ago, the heathen witches boiled them in grease.
You forget the girl and everything else and
jump out thoroughly clothed; i e., clothed in
scarlet skin. Ah, these are things which try
men's souls.
The Story of a Wood Cut.
rittiburg Pispatcb.
A few months before President Garfield waa
shot, a leading citizen of a town just over the
Ohio border ordered a cut of himself from an
enrraving firm in Iittsburg. His portrait waa
duly prepared for appearance in a home weekly,
but when the wood-out and proof reached hluo.
C. O. D., the features lacked some of the essen
tials of sublimity which he knew of in the origi
nal, and he refused to take the package from
the express office. It came back to the engraver,
and after the ancestors of the swallow-tailed
cockroach which has just crawled up my sleeve
had gnawed an Irish accent onto its Roman
nose, and the dust had filled up all the wrinkles
wherein meditation used to wallow on its fore
head, the cut passed as part of a job lot into the
hands of J. W . Breen, of the Sunday Globe.
Brother Breen buys cuts much as Mrs. O'Reilly
Maginnis bought the coffin plate with Hans'
Dinkelstein's name on it thinking that if she
lived long enough Maginnis might fall off the
ladder, and if she married a man named Dinkle
stein the plate might ultimately come handy.
Those who have undergone the illustrations in
some of the daily papers may find it hard to be
lieve, but. nevertheless, it is the general theory
in journalistic circles that every one of these
triumphs of the wood-choppers art resembled
somebody that somewhere upon the disfigured
faco of the defenseless earth there are men who
look like these things. Mr. Breen kept the cut
and waited. When Garfield was shot it occurred
to him that it would be a good thing to have a
portrait of Guiteau in his paper. There- wasn't
time to p-et one, the leading citizen of the Ohio
town had n? friends handy, and so he put in the
old cut tiuly labeled with the assassin s name.
It was a great hit. The press was kept hot un
til late in the afternoon to supply the demand
for papers. People commented on it, declaring
that "he had the look of an assassin," and thac
"you could see it in his face." The next day
brought a handful of telegrams from country
papers wanting to buy the cut Mr. Breen al
though, like all newspaper men, he cares noth
ing for money except that he may do good with
it is a thrifty man. He forthwith got a lot of
electrotypes made from the cut for thirty cents
apiece, sold them to his confiding cotemporaries
for S3 each, and for several weeks the leading
citizen of the Ohio town was cursed to his face
all over Western Pennsylvania under the name
of Guiteau. The engraver fed fat his ancient
grudge, and it was an excellent portrait of tha
assassin until the real pictures began to appear.
Even yet there are people in the outlying coun
try hereabout who remember Guiteau as a bald
headed man in spectacles, with a wart on hi
forehead like a moss-agate.
Phenomenal Woman She Admires Snakes,
Margaret W. Leishton, in Swiss i ross.
My favorite atnonc ophidians is the lovely graaf
snake, eyclophis verandia. I have never been
able to secure more than one of these, whieh I
kept for some time as a pet It waa milky green
in color, and continually reminded me of the
jade bracelets so much worn by tbe Chinese.
One day Gypsy, as the little fellow was christ
ened, escaped from bis usual place of confine
ment, and coiled about a window-fastening,
where he was discovered by a member of the
family who bad "decided objection" to Bakes,
As I could not bear to add to my alcoholic speci
mens one which had been a pet, I took him into
tbe woods and roleased him, where, no doubt, he
is disporting joyously at this moment
The best method I have found for capturing
snakes, excepting the large black ones, is the
following: When yon see one that yon want,
endeavor, by all possible means, to cover bin
with yonr net Then grasp his neck between
the thumb and forefinger of yonr eloved hand
and put bim into one of the tin cans. On re
turning home saturate a small sponge with,
chloroform, which thrust into tbe can with your
snake Yon can do this in a small room to pre
vent the snake's escape. In the course of &
quarter of an hour the enake may be taken
from tbe can and arraneed in a bottle, which is
then to be filled with alcohol and tightly corked t
and your anecimen is ready for the museum.
On one of these bunts a lady wbo was search
ing for botanical specimens happened to come
along just as I was putting a snake into one of
the tin cans. She inquired what I was going to
do with it, and I said, "Preserve it" whereupon
sbe asked, "Do they make uood preserves!"
Goethe kept a pet snake, which he took from
the chimney-corner every night and fondled,
which shows that he was oartial to these "nox
ious reptiles," and Doctor McCook says the snake
is the most beautiful animal in creation. I don'
know bnt I agree with him.
The Goose Bird.
Johnny's Composition, ia San Francisco Examiner.
Goobos are tbe biggest birds knone to the
human eye, and the he one is a gander. The
gander is the monark of the air. but the rooster
can lick him, cos the rooster be is brave like Gen.
Solomon, but the gander isn't fighty, more like
preachers. The goose is a sailer, but not m
wicked one like Jack Brily, wich chews tobacko
and swears, and evry thine, and it bas got lethers
between its toes for towolk the wotter hek
thing of life. Ducks they are sailers too, but
thoswon bas got a long neck like a giraft, and
wen it has got a sore throte it is mighty sick.
The little gooses is goslums, and is green. My
sister, she see a goslum, and she ast Uncle Ned
wot mads it green, and he said, Uncle Ned didj
that it was cos it wasent ripe Then Billy, he
spoke up and said wen it was ripe it would be
picked. .
A SKILLFUL ROBBER'S WORK.
Ha Breaks Open tbeCarMannfactnrinj Com
pany's Safe, but Gats Little Money.
The private watchman of the Indianapolis Cav
Manufacturing Company yard?, near tbe Hadley
avenne crossing of the Belt railroad, left the
company's office at 6:45 o'clock last evening to
goon his beat around the property. Returning
in a half hour he found that the vault in the
office had been opened, the drawer broken and
papers, tickets end envelopes they contained
seatterred over the floor. Muddy foot printe
were left ppon the carpet and following thent
to their starting point, he discovered that
large pane of glass in a window of the rear room;
bad been broken. Tbroneh this the safe
breaker got into the office. The vault doors'
were fastened by an iron bar and a large car-lock.
It was only the work of a minute
for bim to break the lock with a
heavy king bolt which he had picked up in the
yard. He ransacked tbe drawers in a hurry, as
a pay-envelope containing $15 for one of the
employes had been overlooked. The men
were paid off abont a week ago, bnt as is usual
it is supposed there were still several of these
envelopes with money in them waiting the call
of workingmen who were not anxious abont their
wages. Bnt at . no time is a large amount of
money kept in the vault Tbe cash there hardly
ever exceeds $20, aside from tbe pay-envelopes
mentioned. No one but tbe paymaster knew
the exact amount in the vault last night, wbicjai;
Colonel Millard thinks could not have been more
than $200.
Tbe foot-prints show that tbe safe-breaker
was a small man. A few days ago e man wbe
would answer this description as to size, came to
the St Denis Hotel, near the stockyards and
about two squares from tbe ear-works. Yester
day he left, taking with bim a suit of clothes
belonging to the landlord and another ont of a
boarders' room. He left in thtir place
his coat, in the pockets of which was found m
latter s.gned by Chsrles Bresner, of St Louis,
recommending one Joseph Wieeaud as a trust
worthy man and comoetent molder. It is pos
sible this fellow robbed the vault, but there ta
another theory which attributes the crime te
some half-grown boys who are under suspicion.
It is Absurd
For people to expect a cure f or Indiges
tion, unless they refrain from eating
what is unwholesome ; but if anything
will sharpen the appetite and give tone
to the digestive organs, it is Ayer's Sar
saparilla. Thousands all over the land
testify to the merits of this medicine.
Mrs. Sarah Burroughs, of 243 Eighth
street, South Boston, writes : " My hus
band has taken Ayer's Sarsaparilla, for
Dyspepsia and torpid liver, and has
been greatly benefited."
A Confirmed Dyspeptic.
C. Canterbury, of 141 Franklin st.t
Boston, Mass., writes, that, suffering
lor years from Indigestion, he was at
last induced to try Ayer's Sarsaparilla
and, by Its use, was entirely cured.
Mrs. Joseph Aubin, of High street,
Holyoke, Mass., suffered for over a year
from Dyspepsia, so that she could not
eat substantial food, became very weak,
and was unable to care for her family.
Neither the medicines prescribed by
physicians, nor any of the remedies
advertised for the cure of Dyspepsia,
helped her, until she commenced the
use of Ayer's Sarsaparilla. "Three,
bottles of this medicine," she writes,
." cured me."
