sinking fund, leaving aboat $40,000,000
as the net surplus revenue for the year
ending June, 1884. Instead of recom
mending a reduction of taxes to get rid
of this surplus, he recommends larger
appropriations for the navy and for
harbor defense, which is simply an
expedient for keeping up the pro
tective tariff system, against which
the country has emphatically pro
nounced.
In the interest of the national banks,
he asks the reoeal of the tax on their
circulation, and recommend an im
practicable plan for perpetuating them

Eis recommendation for the repeal of
the act organizing the territory of Utah
and its remission wholly to the govern
ment of the L mted states, seems to ns
to be timely and iast. It looks to the
eradication of the abomination of Mor-
monism.
He speaks of the reduction of the In
ternal Revenue Districts, from 120 to
80, of the present costly and cumbersome
system of collecting the revenue, by
whic'i an army of collectors, detectives
spies, gaugers, and goujeri are fed at the
public expense, really to perform pari
san service.
In reference to the recent civil right
decision, the President says: "Any leg
islation whereby Congress may lawfully
soDDlemeni the guarantees which the
ST
Constitution affords for the equal enjoy
mentbyallthe citizens of the United
States of every right, privilege, and im
munity of citizenship will receive my
unhesitating approval." But as every
class of onr pewple enjoy equal civil an
political rights under existing laws, the
pledge of the President to co-operate
with Congress to secure what is already
f ullv accomnlished is sunererorrative. It

only not been given to a buldoeing spirit
in national matters, but she has actually
recognized the bitter sectionalism in the
North and for the sake of the general

her representatives have felt that self

over sectionalism, and for that reason

it means more than that. It is the tri

Democratic party as the great champion
of a low tariff and the opposer of all

Exeoitivo Rewards."
The Public Printing.
The Meridian Observer learns that
Mr. R. II. Henrv, of the State Ledger
ia a candidate for Public Printer. When
the Legislature meets it should pass a
law requiring the Public Printing to be
let out to the iowest and best bidder,
who should be required to enter into
bond with satisfactory security that all
printing required by the State Govern
ment shall be promptly executed and in
the best and most workmanlike manner.
The Government of the United States
does not buy a pound of pork, a bushel
of corn, a bale uf hay, or a ton of coal,
without inviting sealed proposals for the
-ante, and we see no reason why thous
ands of dollars should be expended
annually by the Legislature of Missis
sippi to build up a newspaper, which, in
plain language, means to give strength
and influence to a purely pergonal organ.
As such things have occurred in the
past, the present is a good time to call a
halt, and we trust that there will be
found independence and manliness
enough in the Legislature to reform an
abuse that has existed too long.
If the Legislature considers it abso
lutely necessary to build up a public
journal, and make it influential by vir
tue of patronage, let that body vote a
bounty at once, and then the journal
receiving it will be known for what it is,
a tubtidizfd pr'tt. Vicksburg Herald. -
The present editor of the Herald would
not be happy unless he could throw dirt
occasionally at Tee Clariox. He
seems to live in a muddy, murky atmos
phere, and beholds through a glass dark
ly all objects that have been, or may
possibly be in the way of bis prefer
ment. The charge in the foregoing, that
this journal is "a purely pergonal organ,"
or that it is "i uotfuryf pre" would
be serious did it come from any other
source. Its value as an outspoken, in
dependent newspaper, will not be deter
mined by the en vionsguageof the Herald
Tit;: Clarion is the organ of no man
or set of men m office or out of it Its
highest ambition is to be an organ of
the people, and it was ' built up" by the
p?o le, and by the industry of its foun
ders and their successors, long before it
had any connection with the public
printing, or before the Herald came into
existence.

for Public Printer, and the "lowest and

riously urged. 2ow, however, it con
cludes that it is "a go d time to call a
halt," and declares that the Legislature
will not exhibit an independent or manly
spun unless it reforms what it declares
an abuse that has existed too long."
The Legislature has frequently differed
with the Great Conscientious, and it may
do so aeain. At anv rate, it will be
competent ta settle this matter as it may
deem best for the public good. A few
years ago a proposition was made to do
the printing for twenty-five per cent,
leu than the rates then allowed the
saving to go to the public school fundi
But the Legislature has continued to
take ample care of the public schools,
and through its appropriate committees,
agreed upon a just and reasonable bawu
of compensation for the public print
ing; and these rates were reduced bv

increased quantity of printing now re
quired, as compared with ante Mum
years, there has been an annual re
duction of several thousand dollars
since the Uemocratic party came
into power in 1876. One of the first bills
introduced in the Legislature of that
year was to reduce the cost of the print
ing, which, during the six years of Re
publican rule, bad amounted to $72,615,-

Arthur's Mild Suggestion.
Though we have taken occasion to
commend President Arthur's message,
besides differing with him as to several
recommendations, we think it is very
much to be regretted that he asked for
legislation in the special interest of the
negro. If the negroe were really op
pressed as a race, it would be praise
worthy for the executive to speak out
in his defense. But such is not the case
It is true that persons doing certain
kinds of business do discriminate against
him as to certain places and special priv
ileges, but never or rarely to his discom
fort. With us here, though we wish the
negro well, it is thought that he has all
the liberty which will conduce to his
advancement and well-being. The pas
sage of any laws, if any can be passed
constitutionally by the general govern
ment, will bring about irritation and
clashing between the races. For in
stance, suppose a law were enacted
which would force children of both
races to attend the same schools.
Whatever Northern theorists may say,
we of the South, whether black or white,
know well that this would be productive
of much evil and would greatly demor
alize, if not completely destroy the
public school system. Let the general
government regulate our relations
each ot her as States and lea ve to the States
that function which they have never snr
rendered, to adjust and control us in our
individual capacity. The Republicans
rode into power on the negro question
and they cannot relinquish their favor
ite theme now. It is not that thev care
so much for the black race, as that they
may appeal to his ' prejudices and win
his vote. With the cry of freedom for
the negro, this party has disregarded
and destroyed for a time, some of the
dearest rights of the whites.
Why cannot Arthur and the rest leave
the social question as it affects the negro
to right itself, as it surely will if per
mitted to do so? The Sooth wishes to
treat the negro fairly, and will do so
and all this agitation is not only f uiilo
a " .
or worse, out it is an imputation upon
our section, which is unjust.

friends, through the same medium for
this complimentary expression of kind
pertiamy. Ana, as a am am an aspir

The Iowa Excursion.
For weeks past this section of the
country has bean flooded with illumi
nated hand-bills setting forth the fact
that on a certain day there would start
from some point ia Iowa, an excursion,
bearing seven or eight hundred im mi-
gran ts seeking investment in the South,
the train to reach Jackson at ao many
minutes past a certain hour on a certain
day. It was very generally understood
that the rich OoL B. H. Ever who re
ceatlv purchased a milieu acres of Mis
sissippi leads at S5 cents an acre, Was at
the head ot the excursion, and wasbnng-
ing these people here not only to occupy
tnese tanas ot nw, out oe distributed
tbrought the State and help build up
our waste places and restore order ont
chaos. It bow appears, however to have
been a pious fraud of the. first Water.
No such train, we are informed reached
Jackson, and the hundreds of intelligent
farmers who and gone to that place
from the various counties in the capacity
of committees, to receive these welcome
guests and inyeetsaeat seekers, were com
pelled to repffrt the doleful intelligence:
the elephant died on the way and the
show is bunted to flinders. Raymond

As Appeal for O'BeaneU.
Patrick O'Donnell was summarily
tried in I-oudoa last week and condemned
to be executed on the 17th inst. Some
of the circumstances attending the trial
are anomalous and irregular. The kilt
ing of James Carey took place within
the jurisdiction of the Cape of Good
Hope, and according to a well establish
ed English custom, which has all the
force of the common law, should have
been tried there instead of ia England
While the jury were making np their
verdict they returned to ask the Judge
whether, if Carey was using a weapon
so as to endanger O'Donnell' life, his
act would be murder or manslaughter.
The Judge replied that it would be
neither, but asked them to show the evi
dence that pointed to such condition of
things. This was certainly undertaking
to aid them in determining facts of the
case, which was alone the province of
the jury, as much as his was to decide
points of law. It would seem, too, that
had he only given the information asked
that the verdict would have been acquit
tal. The treatment of the prisoner by
the court after conviction was harsh in
the extreme.
In view of thee facts, and the further
one that O'Donnell was a naturalized
American citizen, a delegation of Con
gressmen (all Democrats) called on the
President on the 8th, and asked him to
intercede with the British government
for a stay of execution till the matter
could undergo investigation on the part
of the United States and proper repre
sentations could be made in behalf of
the prisoner. The President assured
the delegation tha the would do all in his
power through Minister Lowell to obtain
a respite for the prisoner.

Editor Clabios: I notice in your
issue of November 28th, the following
extract from the Natchez Democrat:
"We have just been able to get a cor
rect statement in regard to the election
in Franklin county. It seems that after
the Democratic convention failed to
agree upon nominees and split on the
candidates for representative, the ex
ecutive committee of the county agreed
that the ticket should be made np with
the names of all the Democratic candi
dates on it, thus making the canvass a

adopted. Hon. J. H. Field, of Colum
bus, was one of the most active members
ef the Congress, and was chosen as ora
tor for the next meeting? a compliment
well bestowed. Among the resolutions
adopted was one urging the creation of
a Commissioner of Agriculture, to be

Allow me, as the Chairman of the
Democratic Executive Committee of
Franklin couuty, to correct the forego
ing statement and others of a similar
import that have appeared in the Natchez
Democrat, which appears to be strangely
partial to the independent and bolting
candidate for the Legislature in Frank
lin county.
As to the "split" ia the Democratic
party, there was none, except that which
occurred by reason of a "bolt," by a mi
nority of the Convention when it was
apparent that Dr. Johnson could not be
nominated. The fact is, that a Conven
tion to be composed of the regularly
elected delegates from each box was
called, both candidates for the Legisla
ture agreeing to submit their claims to
the Convention thus elected. The Con
vention, by ordrof the Executive Com
mittee, was to be composed of 54 dele
gates. The delegates were elected by
the primary meetings at each box. The
Convention assembled, and when it was
apparent, after the preliminary organi
zation and proceedings, that of the 54
votes Judge Magee had 28 votes, the
minority, who were supporters of John
son, withdrew, and during the recess for
dinner some lo or 20 ot the minority
assembled and declared their preference
tor Johnson. ben tpe regular Con
vention re-assembled after dinner, there
were present 30 delegates and c-f this
number Judge Magee received 28 votes,
a majority of tho whole Convention,
aud was regularly declared the nominee.
Thereafter Johnson declared himself a
candidate against the regular Democrat
ic nominee, and managed with the aid of
a large proportion of the opposition
vote to squeeze in by eight majority, as
the vote is returned by the election com
missioners. I give yon these facts as the represen
tative of the Democratic party of Frank
lin county, and as a matter of justice to
our party and our people. It is cold
comfort to the staunch Democracy of
Franklin county to see the organs of
the party at the Capital aud elsewhere
extolling the virtues and the democra
cy of a disorganizer, a bolter and an in
dependent candidate. Our good old
county has been true in every emergency
in the pas, and we expected better treat
ment at the hands of Democratic news
papers. Yours truly,
John Tt'CKER,

One of the most distinguished mem.
bers of the bar in Mississippi. Gen. E
C. Walthall, writes the Governor as fol
lows:
The rich and populous valley of the
Congo is being opened to commerce by a
society called the International African
Association, of which the King of the
Belgians is President and a citizen of the
United States the chief executive officer,
and large tracts of territory have been
ceded to the Association by native
chiefs; roads have been opened and
steamboats placed "on the' river, and the
nuclei of States estabUslcd at twenty-
two stations under ' one flag, fid
offers freedom to commerce and pro
hibits the slave trada. The objects of
the society are philanthropic. It does
not aim at permanent political control,
bnt seeks the neutrality of the valley.
The United States can not be indifferent
to the work, nor" to the interests of
their citizens involved in it. It may
become advisable for as to co-operate
with other commercial powers in pro
moting the rights of trade and residence
in Congo Valley free from the interfer
ence or political control of any one na
tion. Then follows a tabulated statement of
the country's finances, which we omit.
The total revenues for the fiscal year
ending June 30, 1883 were $398,287,581.
95, and the total expenditures $265,408,
137.54 leaving a surplus revenue of
$132,879,444.00. The message then pro
ceeds as follows :
ESTIMATED SfRPLlS.
If the revenue for the fiscal year,
which will end on June 30, 1885, be es
timated upon the basis of existing laws,
the Secretary is of the opinion that for
that year the receipts will exceed by
$60,000,000 the ordiuary expenditures,
including the amount devoted to the
sinking fund. Hitherto the surplus, as
rapidly as it has accumulated, has
been devoted to the reduction of the na
tional debt. As a result, the only bonds
now outstanding which ore redeema
ble at the pleasure of the Government
are the 8 per cents, amounting to about
$805,000,000 ; 4 per cent-, amounting
to $250,000,000, and the 737 .000.000 1
per cents are not payable until 1891 and
1907 respectively. If the surplus shall
hereafter be as large as the Treasury es
timates now indicate, the 8 per cent
bonds may all be redeemed at least four
'years before any of the 4J per cents can
be called in. The latter at the same
rate of accumulation of .surplus, can be
paid at maturity, and the moneys requi
site for the redemption of the 4 percent?
will be in the Treasury many years be
fore those obligations become payable.
THE XATIOXAI. Dl BT.
There are cogent reasons, however,
why the national indebtedness should
not bethusTapidly extinguished. Chief
among them is the fact that only by ex
cessive taxation is such rapidity attain
able. In a communication to Congress
at its last session I recommended that
all excise taxes be abolished except those
relating to distilled spirits, aud that sub
stantial reductions also be made in the
revenue from customs. A statute has
since beer enacted by which the annual
tax and tariff receipts of the Govern
ment have been cut down to the extent
of at least $50,000,000 or $G0,000,KM).
While I have no doubt that still further
reductions may be wisely made, I do not
advise the adoptiou at this session of
any measures for a large diminution of
the national revenue. The results of
the legislation of the last session have
not as yet become sufficiently apparent
to justify any radical revision or sweep
ing modification ol existing laws, in
the interval which must elapse before
the effects of the act of March 3, 1883,
can be definitely ascertained, a portion
at least of the surplus revenue may be
wisely applied to the long-neglected
duty of rehabilitating navy and provid
ing coast defenses for the protection of
our harbors. Ibis is a matter to whicn
I will again advert.
RATIONAL CURRENCY.
Immediately associated with the finan
cial subject just discussed is the impor
tant question ot what legislation is need
ed regarding the national currency.
The aggregate amount of bonds now on
deposit iu the Treasury to support ibe
national bank circulation is about $350,
000,000. Nearly $200,000,000 of this
amount consists of I per- cents, which,
as already stated, are payable at the
pleasure of the Government, and are
likely to be called in within less than
four years, unless in the meantime the
surplus revenues shall be diminished
The probable effect of such an exten
sive retirement of the securities which
are the basis of the national bank circu
lation would be such a contraction of
the volume of the currency as to pro
duce grave commercial eriibarassments.i
How can the darger be obviated? The
most effectual plan, and one whose adop
tion at the earliest practical opportunity
I shall heartily approve, has already
been indicated. If the revenues of the
next four years shall be kept substan
tially commensurate with the expenses,
the volume of circulation will not be
likely to suffer any material disturbance;
but, on the other hand, if there nhall be
great delay in reducing taxation, it will
become necessary either to substitute
some other form of currency in place of
the national bank notes or to make im
portant changes in the laws by which
their circulation is now controlled. In
my judgment the latter course is far
preferable. I commend to your atten
tion the very interesting and' thoughtful
suggestions on the subject w hich appear
in the Secretary's report. The objec
tions which he urges against the accept
ance of any other securities than the
obligations of the Government itself as
a foundation for a national bank circu
lation seem to me insuperable.

On several occasions during the past
year officers of the army have, at the re

these officers I am induced to believe 2 Jas. & E
that the encouragement of the State x$ Jo. Barv
militia organisation by the National i m. a. Lusie
Government would be followed by very
gratifying results, and would afford it
in sudden emergencies the aid of a large
body of volunteers, educated in the per
formance of military duties.
POSTAL MATT KB.
The report of the Postmaster General
contains a gratifying exhibit of the con
dition and prospects of the interesting
branch of the public service committed
to his care. It appears that on June
30, 1883, the whole number of postoffices
was 47,863, of which 1,932 were estab
lished during the previous fiscal year.
The number of offices operating under
the system of free delivery was 154 At
these latter offices the postage on local
matter amounted to $4,195,230,52, a sum
exceeding by $1,021,894,01 the entire
cost of the carrier service of the country.
Th rate of postage on drop letters pass
ing through those offices is now fixed by
bv law at two cents per half-ounc or ; "
fraction thereof. In offices where the
rni svstem has not been establishes!
. -. i.i i t. .:n u

and that, too, even at the risk of dimiu- i Co

no reason, why that particular class of
mail matter should bo held accountable
for the entire coat of not only its own ,
collection, and delivery, but the COlieat
ion and delivery of all other classes, and
I am confident, after full consideration
of thesubiect, that the reduction of the , niuJi

this subject since my last annual message Kernpei
iias not led me to change the view which j l- ,r
I there expressed, in dissenting from I
the recommendation of the Postmaster "
General, that the Government assume ; .
the same control over the telegraph , ,v
which it has always exercised over the L
mail. Admitting that its authority in j ' ' M
the premises is as ample as has ever ,
been claimed for it, it would not, in my
judgment, be a wise use of that author-1 j' wnj,
ity to purchase or assume the control of ;
existing leiegrapn lines, or to construct t
others with a view of entering into gen
eral competition with private enterprise.
The objections which mav be justly
urged against either of these projects,
and, indeed against any system which
would require an enormous increase in j
the civil service list, do not however,
apply to some of the plans which have
lately provoked public comment and
discussion. It has been claimed, for ex
ample, that Congress might wisely au
thorize the 1 os tin aster Ueniral t con
tract with some private person or cor
poration for the transmission of mes
sages at specified rates and under Govern
ment supervision. Various such
schemes of the same general nature, but
widely differing in their special character
istics, have been suggested in the public
prints, and arguments by which they
have been supported and opposed have
doubtless attracted your attention. It
is likely that tho whole subject will be
considered by you at the present session.
In the nature of things, it involves so
mar y questions of detail that your de
liberations would probably be aided
slightly if at all, by any particular
suggestions which I might now submit.
1 avow my belief, however that the
Government should be authorized by
law to exercise some sort of supervision
over inter-State telegraph communica
tion, and I express the hope that for
attaining that end some measure may be
devised which will receive your approbation.

BANKS AND BANKING.
For averting the threatened contrac
tion two courses have been suggested,
either of which is probably feasible.
One is the issuance of new bonds hav
ing many years to run, bearing a low
rate of interest, and exchangeable upon
specified terms for those now outstand
ing. The other course, which commends
itself to my own judgement as the bet
ter, is the enactment of a law repealint;
the tax on circulation and nprmittinrr
i. l- , . e
mc umiks io issue notes lor an amount
equal to 90 percent, of the market value,
instead of as now the face value of
their deposited bonds. I acree with th.
Secretary in the belief that the adop
tion of this plan would afford the nccpa-
sary relief.
WHAT TO DO WITH THK TRADE DOLLARS.
The trade dollar was coined for the
purpose of traffic in countries where
silver passed at its value, as ascertained
by its weight and fineness. It never had
a legal tender quality. Large numbers
of these coins entered, however, into the
volume of our currency. By common
consent their circulation in domestic
trade has now- ceased, and they have
mus oecome a orsiurDing element. Thev
THE MORMONS.
The Utah Commission ha sub
mitted to the Secretary of the Interior
its second annual report as a result of
its labors in supervising the recent elec
tion in that Territory, pursuant to the
act of March 22, 1882. It appears that
the persons by that act disqualified, to
to the number of about 12,000, were ex
cluded from fhe polls. This fact, how
ever, affords little cause for congratula
tion, and I fear that it is far from in
dicating any real and substantial pro
gres toward the extirpation of polygamy.
All of the members of the Legislature
are Mormons. There is grave reason to
believe that they are in sympathy with
the practices that this Government is
seeking to suppress, and that ite efforts
in that regard will fie more likely to
encounter their opposition than receive
their encouragement and support. Even
if this view should happily be erron
eou, the law under which the commis
sion have been acting, should be made
more effective by the incorporation of
