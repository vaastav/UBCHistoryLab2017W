ETJROPEAK WAB CENTERS
AROUND THE FIGHT FOB POLAND.
Intense Suffering From Cold and Fear
fnl Slaughter Continaes and the
Germans are Claiming S accesses.
London, Dec. 8. The great battW for
possesion of Palond continues. The
front -extends: along - three, -hundred
.miles and victory over a part of it,:at
least appears to have fallen to tho
Germans ' :whlle the Russians are
pressing on Cracow in the sonth. .
That Lodz Is in possession of the
Germans seems undoubted as - a Rus
sian official report just issued appar
ently is preparing the publlc'for the
news by referring, to the difficulty, of
defending the city, which gives "an ab
normal contour and forecasts a re
forming line..
Details of these, mighty battles yet
have to be. written. The general fact
that there has been fearful slaughter
and intense suffering .from. the cold
Comprises about' the total of the infor
mation received. -: ;
; The Germans claim they are pursu
ing the Russians south and southeast
of Lodz.4 Several correspondents were
with the Russian army; when the bat
tie broke out nothing has beGn beard
from them for Several days. Appar
ently they are under the hand of-.
second line organizations. , .
British military expert insist that
three-Quartera of ihe test material, of
the German army has been held in the
western theatre of the war throughout
the campaign and .that troops opposing
the Russians . consist principally, of
second line organizations. '
The French official report, tonight
announces -that- the Germans have
made a violent attack on the. allies at
fit Eloy, south of : Ypres, which was
repulsed. This may mean a renewal
of the German attempt to batter
through the allied llnes. Elsewhere in
the west there .have -been only local
eRAu!?rian Tnd Servian reports con

eidered a remarkable achievement:
Less than a fortnight ago" the army to
which this victory has. fallen was sur
rounded by Russians and cut its way
out only at the last - moment losing
great numbers of . men and many guns.
Yet it was able quickly to reorganize,
take the offensive and defeat the Rus
sians defending Lodz.
Ttiis was made possible by the net
work of strategic railways on the Ger
man side of . the frontier, over which
reinforcements can be sent where they
are most needed. The Russians, on
the other hand, vigorously attacked on
both wings were unable to send fresh
men to stiffen their center to meet the
German wedge and were compelled to
fall back.' . ' : '
There undoubtedly will be much
more fighting before the campaign in
this district is concluded. The whole
Russian line is now straightened out
and will contest every foot of ground
with the invaders.
In the meantime, taking advantage
of the pre-occupation of the Germans
in the East, the allied French. Bel
gian and British force have begun
an offensive movement in the West.
They are now virtually tn possession
of the left bank of the Yser Canal and
in Northern France, particularly w in
the neighborhood of Labassee where
where the Germans hold a very strong
position, the allies, are beginning .to
feel their way eastward. ,.
:The same process is being followed
along the whole' front -
The advance in the northwest has
ended for the present at least in the
opinion, of many,, the German menace
of the coast'ports. It is believed that
so long as the Germans are compelled
to keep up the strength of their army
in the East they will be unable to as
sume the offensive in the West. There
is a report, however, that the'Germans
have kept the pick of their western
army in the Aisne Valley whence, at
an opportune moment, they . can, hurl
it against the French lines and make
another effort to get through to Paris.
King Peters of Servia, who has been
ill for several months, has assumed
conimand' of the" Servian army, and
according to a Nish report has' check
ed the advance of the Austrians, in
flicting, heavy losses upon them. The
Austrian reply to this is that-"the oc
cupation of Belgrade necessitates the
re-grouping of our troops."
The -political news of tie. day was
the authoritative announcement from
Sofia that it was not considered posl
slble anything would intervene to
make it necessary for Bulgaria to
change her policy of strict neutrality
until next Spring. ' ' w '

- London, Dec . 2r-Belgrade, until the
outbreak of the war,. Servia's capital,
was occupied today by Austrian troops.
The Servians previously had evacu
ated the city. -
Thus oh the 66th anniversary of the
reign Of v Emperor ..- Panels Joseph,
who again is reported, seriously ill,
and. four months' after the outbreak
of the war, his generals report one of
the most important successes the
hae obtained. y ,
. Belgrade frequently was bombarded
early in the war and but -for the ne
cessity that compelled Austria to send
troops against Russia must have; fal
len easy prey to Servia's big neighbor.
Apparently Austria - miscalculated
the nature of the Servian opposition
and only after Bosnia was invaded did
she send a sufficient force against the
Servians to drive - them back. Now
they are being forced backward and
are eagerly looking for the advance of
Russia has been sendfng Cossack
raiding parties through the Carpa
thians to divert .Austria's attention,
but the - dual monarchy seemingly Is
determined to finish with Servia first
This, however, is only a small affair
compared with what is going on in
North Poland. There the German
army, which, aided be reinforcements,
escaped from the ring the Russians
had forced around it has formed a
new front and at -some points has re--sumed
the ' offensive.) , The ' Germans
assert that in these maneuvers they
made 80,000 prisoners, 1
The Russians, in' a statement issued
through Rome, say their captures
greatly exceed this number. All agree
that losses have been heavy and that
the battle still is undecisive, as it
probably will .be for some days.
For a moment the allies are some
what disappointed that the realization
of a great Russian victory is denied
them. They take some consolation in
that the German attempt to pierce the
Russian lines has failed, and that suffering-
from heavy losses, the Ger
mans are compelled to weaken "their
armies elsewhere. - N -:.- -. ;v ;

CONGRESS CONVENES AGAIN.
President Wilson Takes Interesting
Message Before n Joint Session.
Washington.. Dec. .8.- President Wil
son in his annual address to congress
today, coupled with " a defense of the
country'a military preparedness a, word
of assurance to business that it would
not be. embarrassed by further legisla
tion. He said the trust' and currency
egislatlve program of his administra
tion virtually had been completed "and
that there was a clear and firm road
ahead on which honest men might
travel with perfect . confidence. . N
For passage at this session, the
president urged measures to meet the
changed conditions due to the Euro
pean war, particularly the government
ship purchase bill; to encourage im
provement of navigable waters .. for
generation of power, and the bill al
ready passed by the house to give "a.
larger measure' of self government to
the people of the Philippines."
. Uproarious Ovation.
. When he entered the house cham
ber where Vice President Marshall and
Speaker Clark presided over a joint
session of the senate and house, the
president was greeted with an uproar
ous ovation. Throughout his address
fee frequently - was Interrupted by ; ap
plause, particularly from the V demo
cratic side, demonstrations of approv
al i reaching a climax when,' referring
to . recent agitation over national de
fense, he declared' the. administration
had "not been negligent of national
defendse," that the attitude of the gov
ernment would not1 be altered- "be-,
cause "some .amongst us , are nervous,
and excited," and that, a policy of de
fense . could "easily and sensibly be .
agreed upon." ' .-
In advocating the ship purchase bill
the president said the war in Europe
had left, foreign nations more depend
ent upon the United States for sup
plies and that the government should
provide ships that the nation's goods
night be carried "to the empty mar
kets." '. : ' '
The Philippine bill, the president as-
erted, "would nobly crown the record
or these two years of memorable la
bor.": . .' .-. ' - .
Concerning rural credits ' legislation
he expressed regret that difficulties of
the subject seemed "to render .it im
possible to complete a bill for passage
at this session." -1
Listen Attentively,
. Members of the senate and house
listened attentively.- to the outlliie of
the president's program ; as they did
