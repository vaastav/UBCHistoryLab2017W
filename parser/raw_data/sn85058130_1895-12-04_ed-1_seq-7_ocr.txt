TIlE COURT HOUSE
The time for the completion of the
county court house or rather the an
nex to the court house as promised
by the commissioners is drawing near
and there is no Indication that it will
be finished then or for some months
thereafter
Of course the burning of the old
court house Is not taken into account
in connection with the annex because
that little mishap in no way interfered
with the work on the new building
Speaking of this fire reminds the
writer that exSheriff Belnap called at
tention to the bad policy of building a
court house and jail together because
he said the danger of fire was so great
The old Jail Is located in the basement
of the court house and the fire which
destroyed the old building was started
by prisoners in the jail The new jail
Is located in the basement of the new
building end the danger from thTS
cvjse of lire is even greater than it
was in the old building
Nothing has been said about the
cost of the annex lately but It Is a
certain thing that if there was a mis
take in estimating time it would take
to complete the job that the cost will
of necessity be greater
One of the commissioners at least is
on record to the effect that he would
never consent to more than 2000 for
extras over and above the contract
price of the building He had best be
making some figures soon because
there is reason to believe that the bill
for extras is fast nearing his limit and
like the famous grandfathers clock he
should stop never to go again when
the 2000 mark is reached
The Herald was opposed to the erec
tion of this annex when the proposition
was first broached and there is eason
to believe the people generally will
come to the conclusion that it vas a
gigantic mistake before the building is
completed It is not the Intention to
neglect this Important public Improve
ment and from time to time the Her
ald will call attention to the matter so
that the tax payers may be reminded
of the way their money is being spent

BITS FROM BOISE
TWO IimOTlIEVTS RETURNED
AGAINST STARRH
The Law Against Fusion Alleged to
Have Been Passed By the Late
Legislature Creates Considerable
Stir i
Special to The Herald
BOISE Ida Dec 2The United
States grand jury today returned two
true bills against T A Starrh exre
ceiver of the Halley land office Starrh
is charged with embezzlement Prior
to his arrest civil actions were com
menced against his bondsmen to re
cover the amount of the shortage
Yesterday judgment was taken by
agreement for the full amount
A great many people In the state
and particularly politicians are undec
the impression that the last legislature
parsed a law aimed at fusion of the
political parties which proscribed the
appearance of a name on the official
ballot in more than one place InJhis
they are mistaken Although It was
the Intention of the Republican ma
jority to enact such a law the sec
tion containing the provision referred
to was omitted It was only recently
that this fact was developed and the
Republicans who had hoped to pre
vent a fusion of the Democrats and
Populists next year are in an awful
state of mind and charge trickery on
the part of the opposition
Representative Thompson Rep of
Idaho county presented a bill govern
ing elections It dealt with a number
of minor points and wound up with
the important section containing the
following
The name of a candidate shall not
be printed in more than one place on
the official ballot
Afterwards at a Republican caucus
it was decided to put a bill through
with the antifusion section adding r
few more sections covering minor mat
ters not touched by the original Ac
cordingly a substitute was returned
by the committee on privileges and
elections containing the section An
examination of the printed substitute
shows that a vital section had been
omitted Referring to the substitute
as reported by the committee on privi
leges and elections it is seen that the
antifusion section had prior to the
time it was ordered printed been
stricken out with a pen The printed
copy did not show the section referred
to but in the excitement attendant
upon the election of a United Stated
senator friends of the measure evi
dently overlooked the fact On the 8th
of March the day before the legisla
ture adjourned the measure passed
the house without opposition This
fact leads to the belief among the Re
publicans that this opposition had the
section removed otherwise they would
have bitterly opposed the measure
In the BakerScott election contest
over the auditorship of Bannock coun
ty now in the supreme court an ef
fort is being made to have the court
hold that the appearance of a name
on a ticket In more than one place is
illegal The Republicans thought they
had clear sailing on this point until
they found the session laws did not
contain the important section Their
only hope now is to make such a show
ing as will induce the court to make an
arbitrary ruling

Kansas Delegation Will Leave
Nothing Undone to Secure His Re
ore
WASHINGTON Dec 2The Kansas
delegation in congress is determined to
leave nothing undone to secure the re
lease of exConsul John Wailer from
his imprisonment in Prance After the
presidents message had been reEd this
afternoon the entire delegation of sen
ators and members including Republi
cans and Populists held a meeting to
decide upon their course of action It
was resolved to push a resolution in
both houses calling upon the president
for all the papers and correspondence
in the case Several members thought
this resolution should be accompanied
by one stating It to be the view of
congress that the president should take
immediate action and such a resolution
may be decided upon at a future meet
lairbrom
brom the information at hand the
members took exception to President
Clevelands view that tile correypona
ence with France upon the matter is
progressing satisfactorily The only
question raised was whether or not the
reply to the resolution calling for pa
pers should be awaited before mora
vigorous steps were taken
Representative Miller from whose
district Waller was appointed to His
consulate was empowered to draw the
resolution and 1iS had a conference
regarding it tonight with Mr Mitt the
probable chairman of the committee on
foreign affairs
