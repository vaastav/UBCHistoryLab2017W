DURING THE( LATE PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION.
FAILS TO HOVE IN SIGHT.
EVEN WITH THE PRESENT MILD WEATHER, THE
HEADS OF THE CHARITABLE ORGANIZATIONS
ARE TAXED TO THEIR. FULLEST CAPACITY IN
RELIEVING THE SUFFERING OF THE POOR.
FREE SOUP HOUSES WILL BE ESTABLISED IN THIS
CITY BEFORE THE EXPIRATION OF THE WINTER.
According -to the Chicago Inter
Ocean or Sunday morning December
13 there is untold suffering among
the unemployed in this city, and at
the present time more than 121,000
men and women are Idle ,the unem
ployed men afe classified as follows:
Teamsters, 6,000;- Restaurant work
ers, 12,000; Iron workers, 7,000;
Building trades, 25,000; Engineers and
Firemen" (stationary ( 3,000; "Wood
workers, 8,000; Unskilled labor, 60.
000. It Is stated that these figures, of
course, tell only a part of the true
story of the unemployed, for accord
ing to those who are in a position to
lmow, at least 50,000 of those out of
work have families depending upon
them, with, this bad or dark situation
confronting the people in Chicago, it
,iir-expected that much suffering will
xjprevall among the poor, the unfortun
ate and those seeking employment
the remainder of the winter.
Mt seems that for some -reason or
other Republican prosperity, the full
dinner pall and the full coal bin,
promised the laboring people during
the late presidential election fails to
hove in .sight -
So far the organs and the advance
guards of this promised prosperity,
are silent In relation to its long delay
In bringing relief to the toiling mil
lions. Even with the present mild weath
er, the heads of the various charita
ble organizations and' relief societies,
are taxed to their fullest capacity, in
relieving want and suffering among
the poor and the unemployed.

TAFTS SPEECH.
Taft's speech on "Closer Union
with the-South" ought to open the.
Negro's eyes to .the fact it la the policy
of the leaders of the republican party
to assist the Southern white man in
disfranchising the Negro of the
South and to reduce-hlm to a state
of industrial SerrdOBa. The leaders
of the "grand, old party have desert
ed Its lofty principles of human and
manhood -rights In a grand scramble
after material progress and material
wealth. Tali's Idea is that the South
can obey the letter of the fifteenth
amendment and still disfranchise the
great majorfty;of the- black men, that
the masses aJaoaM be. kept in. ignor
ance of their' trae eoailtlony. giv

ly crowded -every dayrwith honest and
hard-working, looking men and wo
men who are seeking a little coal, to
keep them warm, and a few rations
to prevent them from starving.
Every night, the Salvation Army
headquarters throughout the city, are
crowded with homeless Individuals
and provided with a nights lodging.
The Municipal Lodging House, on the
West side, Is filled to overflowing
each night, and it is far from being
large enough, to -accommodate, half of
those who seek shelter underwits tool
In several sections of the city,
many of those who are unable to
raise, 5 or 10 cents, to pay for a
nights lodging; are permitted to sleep
on the hard cold floors, of the police
stations, and they are thankful, for
such wretched accommodations.
It will be recalled, that last winter,
free soup houses were established in
many parts of the city .and if this'
winter the weather becomes real sev
ere, they will have to be established
again, in order to provide the great
hungry and penniless army of unemployed-men,
women and children, with
something to eat.
In the midst of all this; the holiday
season, when every creature, should
be happy and contented with his lot
in life, and relieved of the horror,
of freezing or starving too death, it
is the duty of every one who can
afford to do so; to seek out some poor
and unfortunate human being, and in
a quiet way, humbly assist to relieve
their want and suffer- i- and ji:fisr,
if only for a short while, a little sun

mind .of its shackles and the scales

BEAUREGARD
The new President of
The election of officers of the Ap
pomattox, the leading Negro Social
Club in the west, last Saturday, re
sulted m the election of Beauregard
F. Moseley, over Prof. Wm. Emanuel,
by a two to one vote. This indicated
the popularity of the new President,
and bespeaks for him the earnest and
hearty support of the Club members
during his term of office. Mr. Moseley
is easily the best known, as well as
whose leaders are fighting for better
conditions for the masses regardless
of color, educational qualifications or
property rights, is the Soc'alist party.
The hope of the Negro seems to be
in the growth of the Socialist party
and an education that will learn himj
to think and act for his own welfare. J
The Eagle, East St Louis, HL The f
The shortsighted outfit running The
Eagle, were very loud in their praise
for W. H. Taft, during the preslden-
tlal election, and it was kept busy in
manufacturing lies against William J. v
Bryan and the Democrats, and now
even before President elect Taft, has
assumed the duties of his office, The
Eagle Is railing against him; it should
take its medicine without complaining
and. remember that Judge Taft, will
never raise his little finger, toward
restoring the ballot to the Negro in
the South, and that he rather favors
his disfranchisement, instead of his
enfranchisement.
It is truly gratiying, to state, that
It remained for a Republican presi
dent elect, to advise the Southern
people, to enact their disfranchising
measures, to square with the 15th
amendment, and put the' Negro out
of the political running permanently
in a constitutional manner, instead of
a Democratic president elect, and that
is worth something.
Of course, it is all very well for
Mr. Taft, and his shouters to contend,
that the laws in question should
apply to the ignorant white man as
well as to the ignorant black man.
But everybody knows, that that Is a
wrong construction to put on the in
tentions of the law makers in the
Southern States, for at the present
time and years to come, the Ignorant
and poverty stricken white crackers,
are freely perBaitted, to vote, while
the ignorant and even, intelligent

THE SUPREME COURT DISBAR.
RED TWO CHICAGO ATTORN -EYS,
AND HANDED DOWN DECIS
IONS IN .MANY IMPORTANT
CASES.
Tuesday the Supreme Court of
Illinois, handed down decisions in
many important cases, it decided in
the Sturges case wherein a plate glass
window was broken In-this city by a
mob some years ago, that the city is
liable for all property destroyed by
its lawless element, this being true
the city of "Springfield. Ill- will be
forced to pay its citizens for all thlr
property which was destroyed by the
Christian mob last August, and that
will help some.
Among the other important cases
passed on by the court, was the dls
barrement of Frederico M. Barrios
and John A. Bierman, in reviewing
the cases of these two Chicago attor
neys the court went on to say that:
"Frederico M. Barrios was dis
barred because on his failure to pay
to Mrs. Emma Helsler, a client,
moneys which had been awarded her
in the courts. The evidence shows
that. Barrios agreed to get a divorce
for Mrs. Heisler for $25 and that he
kept the $70 allowed her for solid
tor's fees, and also converted to his
own use the $81 alimony allowed Mrs.
Helsler and had her do washing for
him to the amount of $174 in pay
ment of his services, a total of $350.
"John A. Bierman was blsbarred for
foreclosing a mortgage for Mrs. C.
Christensen in 1906 and failing to
account to her- for the proceeds.
Frederico M. Barrios, for some years

FORCE THE DISCHARGED SOLDIERS TO PROVE
THEMSELVES INNOCENT OF COMMITTING
WRONG DOING.
INSTEAD OF THE GOVERNMENT CONVICTING THEM
OR PROVING THEM GUILTY OF COMMITTNG
CRIME
THE ROUGH-RIDINQ BOY PRESIDENT IS ATTEMPTING
TO REVERSE THE WELL ESTABLISHED RULES OF
EVIDENCE.
THEREBY SETTING HIMSELF
AMERICA.
The following editorial on President
Roosavelt and his latest outbreak on
the "Brownsville affair," is from the
Boston Herald, one of the best and
one of the fairest newspapers in the
East, and it should be carefully read
by those who believe in Justice and a
square deal:
"If it were true, as the President
declares in his special message to
Congress, that the "fact that the Col
ored soldiers did the shooting (at
Bownsville) has already been estab
lished beyond all possibility of doubt,"
corroborative evidence on that point
would now be unnecessary. But the
proof has never been produced. Abun
dant testimony has been given under
oath. Officers of the regiment, and
Individual soldiers, have been heard
by four different tribunals, and no
warrant for conviction or a specific
indictment has been found. The
grand Jury of Cameron county, Texas,
heard the evidence directed against
suspected members of the Negro com
panies, and was unable to report a
bill against any of them. Two army
courts-martial Investigated the charg
es against the troops, and they failed
to find proof of guilt The Senate
committee on military affairs sum
moncd soldiers and civilians to testi
fy before them under 'oath.- But the
committee was unable to identify any
member of the three companies with
the disturbance in Brownsville. Re
peated accusation and assertion of the
guilt of these soldiers by the Presi-
Ldent is not equivalent to proof. The
dismissal of the Negro troops was an
arbitrary act, for which the civil, mil
itary and congressoinal tribunals have
failed to find Justification.
Apparently the President realizes
the weakness of his position. In the
last session of Congress two Jbilla were
before the Senate, each assuming to
be "for the relief of certain former
members of the Twenty-fifth United
Statest Infantry. Senator Warner, of
the committee on military affairs, de
voted several days to a defence of
the administration's policy. He as
sumed and asserted, as the President
had done, that the case against the.
Negro troops was complete. The pos
sibility of doubt was not admitted.
The case was said to be closed.' Re
instatement in the federal service was
to be permitted only on the approval
of the President, who had already
pronounced wholesale condemnation
on the men! Tomorrow was fixed as
the 6&ie on which Senator Foraker
should undertake the defence of the
troops unjustly discharged. The ex
traordinary attempt at corroborative
evidence- which the Preside&t now
makes veharacterizeB the case of the
Executive. His investigation is not
UP AS A NEW CZAR OF
yet completed. He promises more
affidavits, when all his secret agents
have been heard from. But with only
two days before the shell of suspic
ion, assumption and assertion will be
torn to pieces by the searching analy
sis of the Ohio lawyer who holds
the brief for justice and for the
Negro, a partial report of a new secret
investigation Is rushed before Con
gress in order to bolster up the de
fence of executive policy.
For six months a private, detective
agency 'has been at work under the
President's orders. Over thirty states
have been visited. Detectives, named
or unnamed, have seen and cross
questioned 130 of the discharged Ne
ro soldiers. The circumstances of
the interviews, themethot3 of proced
ure and the inducements offered for
evidence may be imagined. No In
formation on these points Is offered.
But, after all, the drag-net has pro
duced only one witness, and he now
: stands by the President's side as the
accuser of the Colored troops. His
name is Boyd Conyers. He was a
soldier in company B of the twenty
fifth. Under oath before the Senate
committee he swore that he knew
nothing of the plot to shoot up
Brownsville. He is not under oath at
the present time. The President's
private detective does not hold a high
opinion of his witness. He admits
that his evidence contains many dis
crepancies. In fact, the testimony of
former Private Conyers comes to the
President's private detective as a mat
ter of hearsay. William Lawson,
character, occupation and present
whereabouts unknown to Congress,
deposes that he secured the confidence
of Conyers, who related to him a
story of the Brownsville plot, and,
under the influence of "a drink or
two. revealed to him what the Presi
dent's private detective describes as
"the "true secret history of the
Brownsville raid. Apologies are
made by the private detective be
cause his man Lawson is illiterate,
cannot even write his own name, and
relies wholly on his memory as to the
declaration of Conyers. The conver
sations between Conyers and Lawson
are said to have occurred in Atlanta
last June, and the deposition by
Lawson was made from memory in
Washington in October! James Pow
ell, who was discovered by the sleuth
Lawson as a corroborative witness
for Conyers, is excused because it
tufas out that he was never in
Brownsville at any time!
