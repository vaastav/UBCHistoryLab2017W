Daily Review of the Leading
Markets.
Special Despatch to The Chicago Tribune.
New York, Dec. T—Great dulucss character
izedthc financial markets to-day, the decline in
gold to 109 5-8 and a break in the rates of money
being the only features. The money market
opened active with 7 per cent as the ruling rate
on call, exceptional rates being gold interests to
the weaker class of borrowors. A short time be
fore 3 o’clock the market became easy at c to 7pcr
cent, and still Inter balances were offered at 5, i,
and 3 per cent, and a loan was made for effect
at ; 2 per cent. The decline below c per cent was
artificial, as were the recent rates above 7.
GOLD
opened at 109 :i-4. advanced to 109 7-8. declined to
lop z-s. the lowest point yet reached in the down
ward movement, and closed at 109 5-8 to 109 7-8.
Kates for carrying were c, z, 7, 2, and 1 per cent.
The temper of the market was decidedly bearish.
The Assistant Treasurer at noon opened bids for
SIOO,OOO gold. These amount to &,eco,ooo, and the
awards were made at 109 31-100 to 109 TiJ-ioo. The
Assistant Treasurer to-day cashed §2,000,000 gold
checks, issued at Washington for the. redemption
of £-203, making a total, thus far, of $13,200,000.
GOVERNMENT RONDS
were dull,though prices advanced slightly on the
old bonds. The new 5 per cents, however, sold
below the 10-40s, which bear the same interest.
Central Pacific closed at 103 3 8 to 1031-2, and
Unions at 91 to 91 3-8 for firsts; 78 7-8 t«* 7* 3-4 for
land grants; 81 to t>2 lor incomes; ami 2C 5-5 to
20 3-4 for stock.
UOREIGN EXCHANGE

STOCKS.
The transactions in tho stock market were
very high, ami there were few fluctua
tions. Tue market wasslightly bettor at
tho close. The report that? 1,009,000 now
prefeircd stock of the T., "\V. A W. has been
pencil, was denied to-day byjauthority.
RREADSTUFJS.
Flour was m more general demand, and with
light receipts prices were firm. Tho trade were
the chief buyers. Choice family extras wore
scarce. The light receipts and less confidence in
freights imparted more firmness. At thcfclo.se tho
market was irregular and very quiet. Spring
wheat was heavy, and winter firmer, and especi
ally for choice for milling. Corn was without
marked change. The demand was generally from
the trade.
TAMMANY’S WORK,
This city is shown by statistics to be growing
scarcely any, and it is almost standing s’tili. This
is ascribed to Tammany and misrule. The loss
in the value of real estate caused by the King far
exceeds (he loss in money which members have
stolen. The greatest commercial prosperity of
the city was in the ten years preceding 1551, and
that was also the period of the most rapid growth
in the city’s population. Great loss of trade lias
taken place since 1800, and so has
the most rapid decline in the
ratio of increase of population. From 1800
to ISGO, the increase in the population was a frac
tion over 28 per cent; for every five 3'earsfrom
iscotoisco the increase rated 57.r0 per cent; bui.
from ISoO to ls7o the ratio was only 13.3. lu 1850
the city contained a population of 00,529, and in
38C1. of Bi:i,GC9. The population of the United
States in IKIO was 5,005,920, and in 1500 it was
01,099,:a}J. The population of this city, according
10 these ligurcs. increased 2 1-2 times faster than
the imputation of the country at large. From
ISCO to 1870 the ratio of increase for the city was
less Ilian it per cent. while that
of the United States for the
same lime was over 32 per cent. Thus with al
most everything relative to the increase of the
country and city. This great change is of the
most startling sigulllcauce. Great cities always
increase in population muen footer man count i ioo
wherein they are situated. Paris increased lu
population at a rapid rate, while Franco remained
nesrly stationary. New York, for a period of
sixty years, increased at a rate of over 50 per
cent every ton years, a ratio of increase more
than double that of the whole country. Suddenly,
in a single decade, the rate droits to less than 14
per cent, or from over twice that of the United
States to less than one-half.

THE MAYOR’S 1J11.1..
It is only too plain that tho bill to increase the
powers of the Mayor of Chicago could have
passed tho llouso yesterday had it not been for
the desire of Cook County members to amend it.
Had it passed, any amendments which tho Gov
ernor might have finally concluded wero neces
sary could have been made in tho Senate, ami tho
House could have easily concurred in them. The
Governor did not sugges; objections with the idea
of stopx>!ng the bill in its course. His objections
could be considered and discussed while the bill
progressed. There is now no saying when the
bill will come up again. Revenue, apportion
ment, aud eminent domain arc very apt to crowd
it to the wall.
cook county aurortionment.
The result of last night's meeting of thof'nk
County members .-bow that thov can come torn
haiinonious understanding in regard to tlio divis
ion of the county into Senatorial Districts. S;*v
cialofthe mcmbcis did not attend, slime they
held that the action taken by the tirst meeting of
the delegation was linal. It was not to their in
terest to unsettle it, and therefore thov declined
to lend their sanction to a change. Those who
did r.ttcutLwere and out voted,left with an umlcr
fdjmllng that they would not yield. It must
therefore bo settled In the House, where the
greater number of Cook County matters are set
tled, and will give rise to bitter discussion. That
side which makes unto itself the most friends
in the House will carry its point, and it seems as
if the Galloway plan will have the advantage
there. In the Cook County delegation this plan
has ten earnest opponents and not quite as many
supporters. The others arc neutral. Kaeh one is
claimed to have the endorsement of prominent
Chicago Republicans.
CORRECTION.
By an unfortunate typographical telegraphic
mistake, Mr. Short was, the other day, made to
say in the debate on the Revenue bill that bo was
in favor of taxing shares, and also the property
represi nted by them. Of course ho is not in favor
of anything of the kind.
REVENUE RILL
Thi> morning the House resumed the consider
ation of the Revenue bill, and made'slow but real
progress, although matters of mere machinery
received the benefit of nearly all the dismission.
That important section, where tho wording cuts
elf the double taxation of shares and of property
represented by them, was adopted without a
solitary objection; but when the paragraph was
reached wificli changes the day of voting from
April to January 1, the farmers united and upset
the change. This result is unfortunate. It is far
easier for business men to make their returns on
the Ist of January. Then there Is a universal
settlement of accounts, and every man knows his
position. It is better for farmers, since on Jan
uary i they have sold off their hogs, got the
money, paid thoir debts, ami know what their
real position is. But there scem> to be an im
pression among some farmers that bankers ami
merchants have more money or goods on hand in
April than in January, and that by listing at a
later day more can be got of them. It is general
ly the case when the fanner wets out to lax
somebody else that that tax finally falls upon his
own shoulders, ami the more ho attempts
to specially tax money, and those
who deal in it, the more bur
dens he loads up«m himself. But general
convenience is so greatly advanced bv having
property listed in January, that It is to be Imped
the amendment will bo defeated in the House.
To-morrow a proj>osltion will come up to strike
out Ibo provision by which persons in listing
moneys and credits arc allowed to deduct their
bo»»<». titlr debts. Were January the time for list
ing, many of those debts of dealers which offset
one another, and do not represent any taxable
value, would be settled: but tho design of offer
ing the amendment is either to force a deduction
of the money owed on a farm or cuttle, or do a
little double taxation, so that tho credits aris
ing from tho passage of goods through three
or four hands, and the goods themselves, make
up a sum liable for taxation three times the orig
inal value of the goods. The determination of
the House not to take the .Senate bill was more
strongly marked to day.
EMINENT DOMAIN RILL
In the House, in the afternoon, the Ihninent
Domain bill was taken up. but was shoved out of
the way lor the purpose of taking up the Appor
tionment bill, the Republicans generally voting
to drop Domain ami the Democrats to keep on
with ir. Imminent Domain was made the special
order for to-morrow, along with the bill to enable
cities to collect taxes.

was taken up. and various amendments were
voted down. one of them, FI.EIIAUTY'S, could
have boon adopted bad it received the entire Dem
ocratic vote, but some of those interested in Die
success of the bill had made arrangements with
some Southern Democrats to vote against it.
on these side issues, and as the amendments did
not favor the Democracy there was no special
reason why they should support them. By some
blunder the friends of the bill bad gotten the im
pression tluit it was on its third reading, and
when Mr. Merritt moved the previous question
on the pending amendment?, they expected, to
reach a vote on ordering the bill to a third read
jug, and to cut off all opportunity for changing
the Cook County Districts, and when the Speaker
at first decided all amendments were out of order
most of the Wcet Side members were very much
taken aback, and some Democrats were little ex
cited. Finally, after seeing the journal, the
Speaker changed. The supporters of Mason's
plan wore exultant, and those of Galloway’s
somewhat disgusted. An effort was made to go
cn with the hilf, but the House was wearied. An
attfliii:! Will bo immo to-morrow morning to put
the Revenue bill out of the way, and try this
again. The bill will most likely pass as it is, for
Southern Democrats are not helped by any of
the amendments proxmsed, the alterations sug
gested being rather against them. As for the
Chicago districts, the Galloway plan seems to
have the most chances in its favor. It is not im
probable, however, that the Senate may amend
the bill in regard to ono of tbeSoutbern Districts,
which is thought by some to bo too large.
The entire forenoon in the Senate was devoted
to the consideration of tho bill extending the lia
bility of railroads for injuries, which was tiaally
overwhelmingly defeated. The result was due
in part to the logical and eloquent remarks of
Mr. Jowcit in opposition to it. The subject in

HOUSE OF RKPBESEXTATIV.ES.
RKVENtTB UILL.
The House went into Committee of the Whole
on the Boveuue bill.
Mr. TOWNSEND moved that they wait till
they got tho .Senate lull, the 4th of January, amt
then consider the two together.
Messrs. CUMMINGS and CAIIPENTHH, of
Keno, opposed the motion, since tho House was
abb; to pass its own bill, amt they did not know
when the Senate would mature a bill.
The motion was lost, receiving hut two votes.
Mr. CASEY, of Jctlersou, movod to strike out
tho provision listing real estate iu the name of
the lessees or occupants. It. was so amended
as to have the real property listed in the name of
the owner.
Sever al amendments wore offered as to the per
son who should list the property o' a deceased
person, sivd the question was discuseed at great
length, but it was left about as il was. Ono or
two' unimportant amendments wore adopted to
tho section relative to listing properly.
The next section taken up was in regard to
listing the properly of banks, telegraph, railroad,
and other companies.
Mr. KING, of Cook, moved so to amend it that
the owner of shares iu any such company shall
not he required to ascertain whether tho proper
ty of tho company has been listed, in order to
avoid listing bis shares, but it shall bo taken for
granted that the company has listed the property.
The amendment was adopted.
The seventh section was amended by making it
cover improvements on railraid lauds not vet
liable D» taxation. It is provided for in another
section, but there wasa desire to have it made
us strong as possible.
The ninth section, which requires properly to
be listed on the Ist of January, was read.
Mr. SITIINGEB moved to strikeout January
and insert April, which had been the day for
some time. Jf property was assessed in January*
the ta x would not be collected for a year and
there would be dlftieulty about having rolls com
pleted before the terms of olliccjof the Assessors
expired.
Mr. SHOUT explained the reasons why the
committee fixed on January. All business men
settled their accounts on January island then
could tell liow he stood. They hail provided for
the elcciiou of town otllcnra at an earlier day.
Mr. MEIHHTT thought that the Ist of April
would be miu-b better for farmers than any other
time.
Mr. HAINES was inclined to support tho pro
•isiou of the bill.
Mr. WAITE opposed the amendment. All ac
counts were settled at the beginning of the year,
and it was a hardship to require men to make out
a new list iu April.
The amendment was adopb-.l—yi-.i-. s;; nv/s,
54, receiving the great bulk of t lie farm sag v.»r<-.
Business men voted the other way.

The Kminenl Domain Bill came up ashy special
order.
Mr. HOOT moved to postpone till tho Revenue
bill was furnished.
Messrs. NELSON and CFMMINGS wanted to
go on with the subject.
Mr. PHELPS thought it wiser to dispose of tho
Apportionment bill llr.-u.
The motion to postpone was lost,and the House
went into Committee of tin- Whole on ths Emi
nent Domain bill.
Since one of tho bills on the subject was not
irlulcd, it avus suggested that they could not go
Mr. BOOT moved that the committee rise for
that reason.
Mr. NELSON called attention to the absolute
necessity for legislation on the subject, and pro
tested against the eternal delay.
Mr.SI’RfNGEU thought all were ready to A’oto

Mr. FLKHARTV amended his proposition,
slightly, and then spoke brieily iu defence of it,
claiming it was more generally acceptable to
the pcoide, and nearer to tho requirements of tho
constitution.
Mr. EFN ER opposed tho amendment, and
Mr. NORTH spoke Avariuly for it, believing the
bill unconstitutional, and also injurious to tho
interest of his county, and ho Avould not vote for
it at the dictation of a caucus.
Mr. PRICK explained that he should vote for
the amendment, since It compiled more closely
with the constitution.
Mr. PRITCHARD followed against the bill, to
which, so far as DuKalb was concerned, his peo
ple were unanimously opposed. He did not in
tend to be bound by a caucus in which he had no
voice. There was no political necessity for the
passage of the caucus plan, and the Republican
party was not driven to commit such injustice
as was involved in this bill.
Mr. JOHNSON offered a substitute specially

The Governor discusses tho national political
situation at groat length. After reverting to the
material welfare of llio State, and congratulating
the people on its prosperity, lie saj-s; “It iseqnal
lv a source of congratulation, that Its political In-
Huenco has been signally enhanced by tho wise
courses of conciliation so emphatically initiated
by onr Inst election. Tho advent of liberalism to
the administration of the State has rc-concllod
the resentments of war, continued absolute
freedom to all, Involved anew the principle of
self-government acting through local organiza
tions* established a purer civil service instead of
that compelled by the slavish wavs of partisan
ship, melted the youthful-"''—" l '- 0 uc ifow gen
eralttu* »w »tnc greja* “»»ot«,»lcTT ur tin? iII
‘ tore, rutlier iimn I‘chubitate itself in dead
Issues of the past.” Ho thou enumerates what
liberalism bus done, and draws a lengthy dis
tinction between the Republican idea, and the
idea which lie says has been foisted upon the Re
publican party. In the discussion of tills distinct
ion ho makes a powerful arraignment of the ad
ministration party and policy as a perversion of
Republican Ideas, and high treason to Republi
can principles. One of Ills closing paragraphs is
as follows: “ The attempt to establish,
by force of martial law. a civil
society that would accord with the superior "ov
ernment never has been and never will boa sue
cess. At present it is not a sucaeas at the North,
and the teachings of 17*0 illuminate the failure of
a century later. There Is latent in the recon
structed States, as elsewhere throughout the
Lnion, much of that sentiment which finds ex
pression in devotion to local freedom, a senti
ment exaggerated into wrongful secession under
tho pliant passion of the slavery controversy, but
on which, in tho absence of slavery, may be
cbuuuclod back into the surest safeguard for tbo
equal freedom of all. It is maintaining tho ger
minal points from which grow those habits of
free opinion, still preserving tho forms
through which it passes into political life and
respecting the distributions of duty. It imposes
the constitutionalism it lias created—'that secur
ity will be found for all who are living in such
society as ours. It ic partly because this is as
sailed and sought to bo supplanted by outward
force alone, that so little advance has been made
by the government in its ostensible reconcilia
tion. The same result would follow in other
States, on any oilier question thus engineered,
and it is worthy of note, by Republican* as well
as Democrats, that-every parry which has passed
from power since the foundation of
the government, lias tho confidence of
the people because of the attempt to unduly ex
alt the national above all local freedoms,
and to strain the national power to ends for
which it was never designed, by methods repul
sive to the common thought; and tho present
wil! only add another to the list, for it is a groat
mi>tahe te suppose that Northern men do not
recognize this latal blunder, or that they demand
a continuance of the method of madness. Id this
behalf trade has been wiser than politics, and it
is ever true that love is stronger than hate.”

At tliis point Avery Pinner introduced the

headed by the President, Hon. John Young. In
welcoming the Canadian delegation, President
Fraley received them most warmly, and after re
ferring to tho urgent need of a better commercial
understanding between tho two countries, he
closed by expressing tho hope and belief that
the business connections cemented between
tho Dominion and tho United States would
political result in their consolidation. This ex
pression was received with marked applause. In
reply, lit n. Sir. Young said that his delegation
was g.’ad to meet the National Hoard and confer
with them upon subjects of such vast importance
to the commercial prosperity of Canada and tho
United States, lie would state that tho Domin
ion Board of Trudc had no connection with tho
government or with any political party. lie at
tached great weight to tho advantage of free in
tercourse between the two countries, and cited

ago, had their respective Custom Houses and op
pressive trade regulations, but since the abolish
ment of all these by the act of confederation,
there had been a full interchange of commodities'

recommending governmental aid in establishing
the International Iron .Steamship Building Com
pany, and asking aid of government in establish
ing a similar Institution at some point on West
ern 'waters where the building of iron
steamboats for Inland navigation shall he

Mississippi levkks.
The board then took up the subject, continued
from the last annual meeting. *f recommending
the Genera! Government to loan its credit by
guaranteeing the bonds of Louisiana, Mississippi,
and Arkansas, to a total amount not exceeding
twenty-live millions of dollars, to enable those
States to repair the levees on the banks of the
Mbsif-sippi RGcr, and to reclaim the public lands,
cud to enable tbo cultivation of the sugar and
cotton plantations.
This proposition gave rise to an extended dis-
cussion, continuing for over two hours, ami
hi liming oiu t he views of nearly every prominent
member ef the board. G. Ballon, of at. Louis
wus the first speaker. Ho opposed the proposi
tion altogether, principally on tho ground that
the construct ion of levees was not the best mode
of accomplishing the reclamation of the lands.
Mr. Bin-well, of New Orleans, spoke at some
length in favor of tin* proposition, excepting that
he did not want the tuxes confined to the lauds
benetltted by the levees, but advanced the as
sumption of the expense by the States at large
Mr. Monroe, of Dubuque, avus not certain as to
whether the construction of levees wds the best
method. He referred to the plan of a hydraulic
engineer who proposed to withhold the supply of
water from the lakes, when the water in tho
Mississippi was high, and also to construct sluice
ways or locks on tho lower river, whereby tho
surplus water could be carried off through canals
He thought tho board Avas not now prepared to
iceonimeml any specific plan.
Mr, Opdyke, of New York, advocated tho
proposition, and was in faA’or of having the tax
a general one in the .Stales concerned. Tho
Southern States Avcro in a condition of impover
ishment arising out ot the late war, and it Avonld
ho proper.and judicious for the goA-ernmont to
lonn ite orr-dit to aid thorn in tho mill
ions of acres of valuable lauds now rendered,
worthless by the overflow of tho Mississippi. He
would recommend this, hut would not commit
the board to any specific plan for the Avork itself.
Mr. Wetherell. of Philadelphia, said if this was
a question of improving the navigation of tho
Mississippi then it was a national Avork, and was
a proper subject for aid from the government;
but it tho design was merely to reclaim tho lands
along the river then it was an affair of the States
interested, and avus not entitled to the aid of the
Gonrral Government. lie was strongly of the
opinion that tlic latter phase was the correct one.
Mr. Hwrwell moved as a substitutca resolution
to tlie ellect that it is proper for Congress to make
a lean of the national credit, for the purpose of
aiding in reclaiming the public domain, and the
restoration of the sugar and cotton lands subject
to overflow, whenever Congress shall bo con
vincedlhat such aid can be advantageously ex
tended.
Mr. Atkinson, of Boston, was opposed to the
proposition in any form, us it was
clearly a private scheme, and not intended
to benefit the navigation of tho Mississippi.
Mr. Holton, of Milwaukee, said it was beneath
the dignity of any State to petition for anybodys
endorsement of her bonds with which to prose
cute works designed to advance her own inter
ests. The States interested in this matter should
scorn assistance from the National Government,
but should proceed on their own credit to the car
rying on of the work of reclaiming the lands.
Mr. Opdykc moved to amend Mr. Burwell’ssub
atitute by including the preservation of naviga
tion.
Mr. Taylor, of Cincinnati, spoke of extending
the nutiinal credit in aid of the construction and
repair of levees. Ho did so ou the ground that
tho navigation of the river was in no manner
connected with tho scheme.
Mr. Ecudlcr, of Boston, opposed the proposition
throughout. If the improvements were so valu
able private enterprise should bring it .about.
Messrs. Cook, of Cincinnati, and Shryoek, of
St Louis, both favored the substitute offered by
Mr. Buiwell.
Mr. Atkinson, of Boston, suggested that the
best course would bo to call tho attention of Con
gress to the subject, with tho recommendation
that suitable” legislation bo had to aid the States
interested to proceed with the repairs and con
struction of levees, under the supervision of en
gineers appointed by tho United states.
Messrs. Seely, of Newark, and Btannard advo
cated tho adoption of Mr. Barwell’s substitute.
Mr. Atkinson moved, as a substitute for the
whole thing, a resolution to tho effect that the
National Board of Trade regard tho improvement
of tho levees as of great importance.
Mr. StKinghon, of New York, called attention to
the fact that many of the levees were destroyed
by the war of the rebellion, and thought tliat the
government was under obligations to repair the
amoge.
Mr. Windsor, of Philadelphia, moved to strike
out that pori;«n referring to the loan of the na
tional credit.
Mr. Roper, of Boston, said that, as a great na
ttonal highway, the banka of the Mississippi
sbou.d bo kept intact at the expense of the Na
tional Government; provided, however, that
tho levee systems were ceded wholly to
the United States and local taxon to
be imposed at tho discretion of Congress; but
this board should not endorse any proposition
that the government give its credit to any local
NUMBER 122.
bonds for whatever purpose. He didn’t like the
shape of the propositions, and suggested that the
whole matter be referred to* a committeeof three.
Mr. Abb: of St. Louis, thought ic would be a
movement of the wisest statesmanship on the
part of the government to assist in reclaiming
the valuable land now devastated by defective
levees.
Mr. Atkinson moved as a substitute a resolu
tion to the effect that the National £ourd of Trade
regards the improvement of the levees of great
importance, ami should be encouraged by Con
gress whenever the States provide for such im
provement under the supervision of the United
Slates Government. r.sd that whenever such im
provement shall be deemed to benefit the naviga
tion of the Mississippi’ River it shouW be con
sidered a proper subject- for a national appro
priation.
Hr. Coper moved to refer the whole stHycct to
a committee of three, to report to-morrow
morning.
Mr. Kirkland, of Baltimore, was onposed'3oany
further delay.
Sir. Wright, of Chicago, spoko in favor of re
eommitting the matter in order that gentlemen
might vote nnderstandingly.
The motion to refer prevailed, and tho Cbtvir
appointed Messrs. Roper, Wetherell, and Coobas

Favorable Comment.* on tbc Provident’
ITfei»»o»e—Earthquake Hhock*.
Salt I.akk, Dec. 7.—Tho President's message
receives earnest commendation from all classes.
Even tho Church organ approves of portions, but
has no reference to that upon Utah affairs.
The general effect of tho message is
excellent among tho Mormons. Few now
express any hope for maintaining tho practice of
polygamy in tho United States. Bonn cling to
the belief that Congress may in some waj- favor
them, but the main question at present is, when
shall tho practice cease, and what will he the
guarantees for the past. Ohe suggestion from a
high quarter is to make the time
twenty-live years hence, that all polygamists
now living may not bo disturbed in the exercise
of their faith.
There la much surprise at the removal of Gen
era! Maxwell from the Land Oflico. The Gentiles
universally regret it and the Mormons rejoice.
There were two severe shocks by an earthquake
on tho night of the ,‘th at Cedar City, Iron Coun
ty. On the morning of tho cth, another shock oc
curred.
The Wharton ITfurder Trial nt Bald.
Baltimore, Dec. 6.—fn the Wharton-case, to-
day, Mrs. Chubb again took the stand, but noth
ing new was elicited.
Tho next witness was Mrs. Meta Hutton, n sis
ter of Eugene Von Ness, who was lying sick at
Mrs. Wharton's house when General Ketohum ar
rived. She testified that she met Kctctmm at
Mrs.‘Wharton’s on Saturday. Juno 2i, and ho ap
peared well. She saw him again on Monday
evening, when he was sick in lied. He said ho
had been quite sick,.but felt better, and that Mrs.
Wharton had poisoned him with a glass of lemon
ade.
Counsel for the defense objected to this declar
ation. It was a.jocularrcinark of tho old gentle
man's, and not evidence. It was ruled out by the
Court.
Tho witness also testified to .Mrs. Wharton’s
sending her from tho room, and in her absence
preparing a dose of medicine for tho General, of
an unusual size, which she persisted in adminis
tering, even before the hour fixed by the doctor.
Its effect was to throw tho General into convul
sions. Ketchmn died at :t o’clock. After his
death, when his clothes were packed up, his vest
could not be found. This witness asked Mrs.
Wharton If she knew where it was,, when she
replied it was in her wardrobe.
