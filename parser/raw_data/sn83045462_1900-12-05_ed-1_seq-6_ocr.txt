On Proper Terms Only.
The anti-giade crosiing crusade which
The Star has led for many years has had
for its object the elimination of the grae
crossings on equitable tern .. fair both to
the nrorations and to tiw# community.
The:- has nev(r been a time whe n the pub
lie could not have abated the evil if it had
be-n willing to relieve the railroads of the
expense of the work. The community felt,
howe *r. that it should be granted this re
lief without being thus burdened.
Bit th- railroads continu( to do the kill
ing and maiming and to niage property
and injure busness interests by unduly ob
structing street crossings at grade. They
have no legal right thus to murder and to
d., this kind uf damage to property. On
the other hand, they are under obligations
to furnish decent and creditable terminal
facilities. safe city trackage and attractive
stali,nas in all of which obligations they
have utterly and disgracefully failed to
this time. Now that. to a considerable de
giee through The Star's efforts, bills are
pending to accomplish these great improve
ments, it is especially important that the
terms upon which the railroads are re
quired to eliminate the grade crossings be
etauitable. in short, that the railroads bear
their fair share of the expense.
Not only should the grade crossings be
elIminated, but they should be eliminated
on just teims. The public should not be
robbed in order to prevent it from being
murdered. The most obvious, staring in
equity In the present proposition is the mil
lion and a half contribution to the Halti
more and Ohio. This item Is now being
strenuously opposed by the board of trade.
and should :ikewise be made the object of
atuick by every other organization and in
terest concernied in the welfare of the cap
ital.
The finanec:il condition of the District
makes the danger of this enactment espe
cially serious. The local revenues have
been wasted by Congress in violation of
the organie act in providing for the exten
sion of future streets, exclusively at the
cost of the District. After that imposition,
to add this B. and 0. burden would involve
so serious a problem that the case should
be carefully analyzed before so heavy an
obligation is incurred. The Star hopes to
see the grade crossing bills passed at the
present session, but first the outrage pro
posed In the case of the B. and 0. bill
shoulH be stricken from that measure.

The Message Abroad.
Foreign comment on the message ought
not to be displeasing to the President and his
friends. Some of It is in a fault-finding
key, but even that shows that the docu
inent rings true. It is first of all an Amer
ican presentation of matters for the Amer
trans themselves, and if it disappoints peo
ple here and there at a distance so much
the better may we be assured at home here I
that the President has scored a success.
He is not playing the game of the foreign
er. He is not playing the game with any
view of injuring the foreigner, but his
chief consideration is to advance the inter
ests of his own people, and on distinctly
American lines. His eye is on his own
gun, and he wants the American powder
kept dry.
The November result need not mislead
anybody abroad. The United States is go- I
ing ahead with its gigantic task, but in its
own way and sustained by its own re
sources. It values all friendships, but it is
seeking no formal alliances. It is an hon
orable competitor for bus!ness, and its
methods are and will remal i business-like,
but it is not land-hunting ! r land-hungry.
Its presence in the PhIlipp.aes is for pur
poses frankly declared, and its part In the
Chinese complications has so far been above
fair criticism. We have suffered with the
other powers at the hands of a treacherous
Chinese government. and we are demanding
redress of our grievances. But we are not
figuring on a slice of China as pay for our
losses, nor are we of opinion that a settle
ment of any power's losses should be made
insuperably difficult by too great exactions.
For all the rest we stand where we have
for some time stood. We are doing a large
and rapidly increasing business with the
world. and consequently are operating on
the world's standard of value. Any other
policy would be financial suicide. If the
leading nations-our competitors for bust
ness-should decide at any time for what
is known as bimetallism in place of gold,
the United States would take no risk in
joining them, and probably would p)romptly
dto so. But, until such time, gold will re
rnain otur mon.ey of redemptIon. And, of
course, the policy of protection will be as
stoutly maintained. Freer trade is growing
out of reciprocity arrangements, and in a
few years there will be little' If any of the
old complaint left of the more conservative
of the tariff reformers. But free trade,
pure and simple, is out of all calculations
now in this country. andl our foreign rivals
would do well to make a note of the fact.
The P'resident in his latest message has
fully and without exaggeration presented
the country's whole case, and nobody, at
home or abroad, need he in any doubt as
to just where as a nation we stand.
The sultan has been spared a great deal
of trouble owing to the actte jealousies
which pervade Europe. But the powers

step in and give him w'hat has so long been
due hinm.
Mr. lienderson with now proceed to malte
up his mind whether he Is going to be a

The Eaglish Temper.
The English people are to be congrattu
lated upon the present slate of their tem.
per. With many provocations to become
irritated, they are carrying themselves
with philosophical composure. The bait
ings of an excitable neighbor are even de
veloping their sense of humor. They are
drawing the proper distinction between the
lacket of vociferous street crowds and the
attitude of those in office who are responsi
ble for good government. It is an assuring
sign, for thIs is a time when all men with
reai heads should keep them on their shoul
ders.
Why thIs, outburst against England in
France today? In a quarter of the world
where the situation for all cIvilIsation i9
grave indeed those two powers are in the
snain acting In concert. Their troops are
fightIng, when fighting is necessary, side
by side. if a French force in China were
menaced by a superior force of Boxers.
the English if within reach would gladly
go to the rescue. And the Frencn would as
gladly perform a similar service for the
EnglIsh. The maint effort of all the powers
is to continue this union of endeavor. If
serioue and unbridgeable differences set
up. the whole case will be lost. The pow
era must.stand toguther it that In which all
... le..eted. end, jet h ........anest.
of which all have embarked in this move
went in China is to be cari-ed through.
And yet, at the most critical stage of these
proceedings, here comes a thunderous ar
raignment of England by the French popu
lace with the Boers as a text, and some
talk in the French senate by an ex-secre
tary of war about forwarding maneuvers
designed to facilitate an invasionx of Eng
land.
General Mercier's talk would be 'mis
chievous If it were not silly, and did not
proceed from a thoroughly despicable and
discredited individual. His idea is that
"the times are not the same as they were
a hundred years ago. Steam. the navy, the
telegraph and the railroad have rendered
the problem of the invasion of England
much easier of solution. Moreover, Eng
land herself is no longer the same. The
Transvaal war has shown that the British
army, although brave, is not equal to the
task which England expected it to perform.
The British navy is powerful, but it has
many coasts to defend."
The new agencies here named all con
tribute not to the weakening .but to the
strengthening of Eng:and against an in
vader. With the telegraph to flasti the
danger over the whole island in
a moment, and ralilrads to rush
troops to any given point on the
ccast, it would take the mightiest of hosts
to secure even a foothold. And against
that host the whole of England would
throw itself with passionate energy. Sup
pose the telegraph wire stretched in every
direction in Ch!na, and railroads grid
ironed the country, and the people were
armed and united in one purpose. How
different their task would be for the allied
powers of civilization! They could not even
have put their present forces ashore.
England has and need have no fears of
an invasion. When Lord Salisbury intro
duces the subject it is but a diplomatic
stroke to strengthen English defenses else
where. In the mouth of General Mercier
the subject is simply amusing.
Evicting the Vicious.
The power of the city government of New
York to purify the slums and particularly
the "red-light district" was demonstrated
yesterday. when, in obedience to the orders
of the police. the proprietors and managers
of the low resorts in that district moved
out by scores. The scene is described as
dramatic. It was a savage Indictment of
Tammany Hall. The evils which were
abated by the exodus of yesterday have
existed for many months, in some places
fo- many years. unmolested. A distinct
bargain prevailed between the conductors
of these resorts and the police, whereby
the former were immune from molestation
as long as they paid for protection. Until
the word was given from a high place that
the evil must he abated, this bargain was
scrupulously kept by the police authorities.
When the voi'e of the big boss broke
silence, after one defeat and in the shadow
of a greater political nienaco, there was a
hrtIling for reform. At first the vicious
classes were loath to believe that the corn
mand could be sincere. They had huard
many times that the municipal authorities
were about to raid them, but they accepted
the tip with a wink and made sure of the
next regular payment. When the city be
came wide-open after the stringen y caused
by the Lexow agitation and later by Police
Commissioner Roosevelt's determination to
enforce the laws, this feeling of security
was strengthened and the dive keepers were
confident that there would be no disturb
arce of the mutually profitable understand
ing between them and the police.
Their amazement when a police captain
actually had the nerve to oust them from
their places, therefore, may be imagined.
What were the police good for if not to be
bribed? Why should a mayor shrink before
the indictment of a. mere bishop? Had not
the big boss uttered words of moral sugges
tion'before and whispered the pass W'ord in
the next breath?
And now they are out, the "red-light dis
trict" is closed, and the city Is wondering
where the reform will end. It ought not to
end until Tammany. the organization that
could have done this years ago and did
not. has been forever crushed as a political
factor in New York. It should not stop
with one neighborhood, from which the
outcasts may merely move into another,
but it should proceed until it has covered
every quarter of the town, until decency
has been established as the rule, from
which the law tolerates no departure. It
should not pause to wonder what has be
come of the wretched people who moved
yesterday out of the East Side slums be
cause comparative morality is to he the
rule there hereafter. It should not hesi
tate merely because some, of these of
fenders may be merely driven from one
city to another.
It should proceed relentlessly, to make
New York clean, and to demonstrate that
there is no place in all the metropolis for
law breakers, or evii doers, or bribers, or
corruptionists, or gamblers, or thieves, or
thugs, as long as the law exists to punish
them and the force is at hand to apprehend
them. Each city must solve its own prob
lems of this character, and when all cities
learn this lesson and proceed fearlessly to
solve the problems, the standard of morality
and right living will rise and continue to
rise in every quarter.
Richard ('roker's encounter with the Eng
dish income tax collector will enable him
to understand the pangs of some of the
people whom Tammany has compelled to
pay tribute.
St. Louis can contemplate the isthimlan
canal project without any fear that it will

ecmplicattions with other cities.

Goi. Stone's Rennedy.
The future of the democratic party re
mains a live and interesting topic. Mr.
Bryan and Chairman. Jornes have spoken
for the democrats and Mr. Teller and Mr.
Towne for the silver republicans, and all
four are still in pretty close agreement.
The "fight," as they express it, must go
on. Nothing is settled, they insist, until
it is settled right, and the right of all pres
eat contentions is, as they believe, with the
combination of polftical forces which in the
recent campaign opposed the national ad
ministration. The English of which prob
ably is that. if that combination can be
held together, Mr. Bryan is to try a third
time for the presidency, on a plattorm
which shall abate none of the leading de
mands which have twice been made in the
name of democracy.
These men are now joined by Mr. Stone
of Missouri, who talks.in their strain, and,
having served with them in two campaigns,
would probably not object to embarking
with them for a third. After flouting all
talk of reorganization on lines suggested by
men of the Cleveland school, Mr. Stone. in
the course of a long signed statement,
says:
"The democratie pat shiuld noct and
cannot co=statatly mananet *ha- nuotaee'
of any pie it ha. advocated, fer' it
has advoctdnothiag that -wapt deine

being discouraged. It is only necessary
that we stand resOutely for the ritht. go
on with the work ot education and organi
zation (not reorganion), keep the party
in harmony with the spirit of the age.
while at the same time guarding our in
stitutions of government, and we will tri
umph in the end."
How could the democratic party "become
more aggressive" than it has been since
the nomination of Mr. Bryan at (icago
In 1806? The platform then adopted was
aggressive to the last degree, and surely
no candidate for offlce ever carried himself
more aggressively than Mr. Bryan did in
that cavipaign. The difficulty was, indeed,
that both platform and candidate were too
aggressive. They threatened too much.
The couptry took alarm. The majority of
the people would not stand for policies so
extreme and advocated by a candidate so
uncompromising. A shade lers of aggress
iveness would probably have inured to Mr.
Bryan's benefit. As it was, he went to de
feat as the eloquent leader of a movement
which was accepted as aggressive to the
point of revolution.
But Mr. Stone employs a second word. He
says the party must become more aggress
Ive and "constructive." There Is wisdom in
that. But the difficulty is that if it 4 to
become a constructive party the democ
racy must abandon the Chicago platform.
That is distinctly destructive. The people
will not accept it In any other light, and
for that reason many democrats have
twice supported Mr. McKinley for Presi
dent as the representative of the only "con
structive" party of the country.

Washington's Centennial.
From tie Pittsburg lispatch.
The approaching celebration of the cen
tennial of the founding of the capital at
Washington is an event of great interest.
A great many people have thought a bet
ter site could have been chosen for the
capital of the nation, and not a few 'nave
advocated its removal to a more central
point. But It will never be moved.
The investment in public buildings at
Washington represents a large sum, even
for a wealthy and prosperous nation, The
investment in private property is much
greater. The thought of destroying either
cannot be entertained for a moment. It
might have been possible to throw away
the work of the first half of the century
since the capital was founded, but not this
last half-particularly the last quarter-in
cluding the new library, department build
lngs anti the -hundreds of magnificent dwell
ings erected by those who have begun o

twenty-five years that Washington has

acter attaching to the capitals of Europe
the best of all guarantees of its perma
nonce.
What the Dead Lettee Oficee Teaches.
F'rom the Clevela sl Leader.
A striking illustration of either the care
lessness or ignorance of the American peo
ple Is furnished by the annual report of the
operations of the dead letter office,
Nothing, perhaps, indicates more c!early
than does the report of the operations of
the dead letter office one of the worst na
tional traits or weaknesses. The American
people are surely careless, and whether this
i.-due to the rush and hurry of their every
day life or to faults in the system of
of education rannot be told off-hand. Un
doubtedly both causes contribute to the
result. Again, many people take it for
granted that the government, having un
dertaken to carry the mall, will see to it
that letters and parcels are deliver-ed at
their destination, even though the a.ddress
may be faulty in some respects,
Railroad Aceldents Rare in Mexico.
From the Boston Herald.
Railway accidents down In Mexico are
very serious affairs for those who are re
sponsible for them. They do not exactly
chain their directors to the cowcatchers on
their trains, but they have a law which
makes a fatal accident on a railroad train
punishable with death to the person or
.persons through whose Ignorance or care
lessness such an accident occurs. This
explains the sudden disappearance of
the engineer and fireman of the lat
est wrecked train down there, and
the threat to lynch them, lest they might
escape across the border before being over
takgen by the officers of the law. It ih su
perfluous to remark that railroad accidents
are of comparatively rare occurrence in
Mexico.
