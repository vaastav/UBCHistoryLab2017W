SPAIN AND CMI A.
A Iteauine of the Conditions Which
Led I'p to the Wnr.
In my last annual message very full con
federation was given to the question of
tho duty of the government of the United
Stales toward Spain und the Cuban In
aurrectlon us being by far tho most Im
portant problem with which wo were then
called upon to deal. The. considerations
then advanced, and the exposition of the
views therein expressed, disclosed my
sense of the extreme gravity of tho situ
ation. Setting aside, as logically un
founded or practically inadmissible, the
rccoKnltlon of tho Independence of Cuba,
neutral Intervention to tid the war by im
posing a rational compromise between tho
contestants, intervention in favor of one
or the other party, and forcible annexation ,
of the Island, I concluded It was honestly
due to our friendly relations with Spain
that she should be given a reasonable
chance to realize her expectations of re
form to which she had become irrevocably
committed. Within u few weeks previous
ly she had announced comprehend ive plans,
which It was conlldi-ntly asserted would
be elllcaclous to remedy the evils so deep
ly affecting our own country, so injurious
to the true Interests of the moihcr country
us well as to those of Cuba, and so repug
nunt to the universal sentiment of hu
manity. Thu ensuing month brought little sign of
real progress towurd the paciiicatlon of
Cuba. Tho autonomous administration set
tip in the capital and home of the pmi-,
ljul cities appeared not to gain the favor
of the Inhabitants nor to be able to extend
their tnlluence to the large extent of ter
ritory held by the Insurgents while the
mllltury arm, obviously unable to cope
with the still active rebellion, continued
many of the most objectionable and olTen
Hive policies of the government that had
preceded It. No tangible relief was af
forded the vast numbers of unhappy re
concentrados despite the reiterated pro
fessions made In that regard und the
amount appropriated by Spain to that
and. The proffered expedient of stones of
cultivation proved Illusory: indeed, no less
practical nor more delusive promises of
succor could well have been tendered to the
exhausted and destitute- people, stripped of
all that made life und home deur and
herded In a strange region among unsyin-
futlic tie strangers hardly less necessitous
hun themselves.
Tho war continued on the old footing

only the same spasmodic encounters, bar

At this Juncture, on the lath of Febru

battleship Maine, whilo rightful. y lying In
the harbor of Havana on 11 mbt-ion of in
ternational courtesy and good will a
catastrophe the suspicious nature and hor
ror of which stirred tho nation's heart pro
foundly. It Is a striking evidence of tho
poise anil sturdy good sense distinguishing
pur nutlonal character that this allocking
blow, falling; upon a generous people, al
ready deeply touched by preceding events
In Cuba, did not move them to ah Instant,
desperate resolve to tolerate no longer tho
existence of a condition of danger and dis
order at our doors that made possible such
a. deed by whomsoever wrought. Yet the
instinct of Just lee prevailed and the nation
anxiously awaited the result of the scurf h
Ing Investigation at once set on foot. Tho
finding of the navul board of Inqulrv estab
lished that the origin of the explosion was
external by n submarine mine, und only
halted through lack of positive testimony
to nx the responsibility of Its Biitherahip.
Action of Congress.
All these things carried conviction to the
most thoughtful, even before the finding
pf the i.avul court, that a crisis In our re
lations with Spain toward Cuba was at
nar.d bo strong was this belief that it
Tieeded bet a brief executive sugges
tion to the congress to rrce'.vet Imme
diate answer to the duty of making Instant
provbuon for the po, slide and perhaps
peed;:y probable emergency of war. und the
rcmuikshie, almost unique, spectacle was
presented of a unanimous vote of both
bouses on the lth of March, a pproprlating
Ki0.OU0.MH "for the national def, nsc sar.d for
each and every purpose connected there
with, to be expended at tho discretion of
thepresltlent." That this act of provision
came nor.e too soon was disclosed when the
application of the fund wos undertaken.
Our forts were practically und'-rereled. Our
, navy needed large provision for Increased
ammunition and supplies, and even num.
hw to eup with any sudden attack from
the-avy of Sns In, which comprised mod-
rn vessel of the hlghosi type of conti
nents! perfection. Our army also required
'enlsrgemert of men snd munitions. The
details of the hurried preparation for the
dreaded contingency is told In the reports
or the secretsries or war snei or tne nsvy,
and need not be repeated here It t sti In
dent to ssjr that the outbresk of the
war, when It did come, found our nation not
unprepared to meet tns connict.
Effort Contlaaed.
Still animated by the hope of a peaceful
solution ana ooeying me dictate or outy
no c-iuri was relaxed 10 tiring anout i
titecdy ending of the Cuba struggle. No
pollutions to this obiect continued actively
with tho government of Spain, looking to
tne immediate conclusion of a six month
armistice In Cuba with a view to effect the
menenltlon of her people's right to Inde
pendence. Keeldos this, the Instant rnvo
eatl.jii of the order of reoiire-ntratlon was

CONGRESS ASKED TO ACT.
Whole )uesllon Submitted to I.cala-

Grieved and disappointed at this barren
outcome of my sincere endeavor to reach
a practical solution, I felt It my duty to re
mit tho whole question to the congress.
In the message of April 11. 18SS, I announced
that with this last overture In the direc
tion of Immediate peace In Cuba, and Its
disappointing reception by Spain, the ef
fort Of the executive was brought to an
end. I ngaln reviewed the alternative

the grounds Justifying that step wire:
The interests of humanity; the duty to
protect life ar.d property of our citizens In
Cuba; the right to check Injury "loour com
merce ai d people through the devastation
of the Island, and, most important, the need
of removing at once and forever 4he con
stant menace und the burdens' entailed
upon our government by the uncertainty s
und perils of the situation caused by the
unendurable disturbance in Cuba. I raid:
In view of all this, the congress was
asked to authotlzo and empower the pres
ident to take mtusttres to secure a fuli and
final termination of hostilities between Spain
a nd t he p ople ol e'uba, and to secure to the
Island the establishment of a stable govern
meiit, capable of maintaining order and
observing its International obligations, iu
cui ii.g peace anil tranquillity, and the se
curity of its citizens as well a our own,
and for the accomplishment of those ends
to use the military and naval forces of the
I'lilicd States as might be necessary, with
added authority to continue generous re
lief to the starving people of Cuba.
Action of Coiiuress Approved.
The response of the congress, after nine
days' of arncHl deliberation, during which
the almost unanimous sentiment of your
body was developed on every point save
as to the expediency of coupling the pro
posed action with a formal recognition of
the republic of Cuba us the true und lawful
government of that Island a proposition
which failed of adoption the congress,
after conference, on the l!tth of April, bv
a vote of 42 to 35 in the senate and 311 to C
In the house of representatives, passed the
memorable Joint resolution, declaring:
"l''lrst. That the pi ople of the Island of

Sonln having thus denied the demand of
the United States and Irltlated that com

attend n state of war, the executive pow
ers authorized by the resolution were at
once used by me to meet the enlarged con

the United States. On April 22 1 pro

Cuba. Including ports on said coast be

port of Clenfucgos on tho south coast of

teers to execute the purpose of the resolu

gress was Informed of the situation and I
recommended formal declaration of the
existence of a state of war between the
United States and Spain. The congress
accordingly voted on the same day the

exlftenee of such war, from and Including

telegraph to all the governmcrt with

In order that their neutrality mlcht be as

neutrality, each after Its own methods.
It Is not among the least gratifying Inci

circumstances.
Response to Call for Volnnteera.
Our country thus, after an Interval of

found Itself engaged In deadly conflict with
a foreign enemy. Kvtry nerve was strained
to me?t the emergency. The respor.se to
the Initial call for 125,000 volunteers wss

of the second tail of May 25 for 75,000 ad

3ti0 mile of linn nt ten great camps, thus
facilitating military movements from
those points In a mnnncr heretofore un

telegraph lines were established nnd main
tained under the enemy's lire at Manila
and later tho Manila- long-Kong cable was
reopened. In I'orto Klco cable communi

the division commanders of four different

powerful squadron under Admiral Cervera,
I ,ki.k had omhtoit t the Cane Verde
Islands before the outbreag or noctiitte,
had crossed tho ocean and by Its erratic
movements In the Caribbean sea delayed
our military operations while butfling the
pursuit of our fleets. For a time fears were
felt lest tho Oregon and Marietta, tnen
nnnriru hnmA after their long voyage from
Sun Francisco of over 15.CH0 miles, might
be surprised by Admiral Cervera fleet
but their fortunato arrival dispelled these
apprehensions and lent much needed reen
forccments. Not until Admiral Cervera
took refugo In the harbor of Santiago de
Cuba about May wus 11 ir.ium w

Antillean possessions of Spain.
Several tlemonstratlons occurred on the

North Atlantic squadron shelled bun Juan

Schley's squadron bombarded the forts

leave the hnrbor, was met by the American
squadron under command of Commodore
Sampson. In less than three hours all the
Spanish ships were deslroyttl, the two
torpedo boats being sunk, und the Maria
Teresa, Almlrnnte Oquendo, Vlzcaya and
Cristobal Colon driven ashore. The Span
ish admiral and over 1.3u0 men were taken
prisoners, while the enemy's loss was ele
plorubly large, some CoO perishing. On
our side but one mun was killed, on the
Brooklyn, and one man wns seriously
wounded. Although our ships were re
peatedly struck, not one wns seriously In
jured. Where all so conspicuously dis
tinguished themselves, from the command
ers to the gunner and the unnamed heroes
In the boiler rooms, each and all contribut
ing toward the achievement of this as
tounding victory, for which neither an
cient nor modern history affords a parallel
In the completeness of the event and the
marvelous disproportion of casualties, It
would be Invidious to single out any for
especial honor. Deserved promotion has
rewarded the more conspicuous actors the
nation's profoundest grutltude Is due to all
of those brave men who by their skill and
devotion In a few short hours crusheel the
sea power of Spain and wrought a triumph
whose decisiveness anil far-reaching con
sequences can scarcely be measured. Nor
can we be unmindful of the achievements
of our builders, mechanics, nnd artisans
for their skill In the construction of our
warships.
With the catastrophe of Santiago Spain's
effort upon the ocean vlrtunlly ceased. A
sp.irmodlc effort toward the end of June
to send her Mediterranean lleet under Ad
miral Camarn to relieve Manila was
abandoned, the expedition being recalled
after it hud passed through the Suez
canal.
Capture of Santlnp;o.
The capitulation of Santiago followed.
The city was closely besieged by land, while
the entrani-e of our ships Into the harbor
cut off all relief on that side. After a truce
to allow of the removal of noncombatants
Jirotrncted negotiations continued from
uly 3 until July 15, when, under menaco
of Immediate assault the preliminaries of
surrender were agreed upon. On tho 17th
Gen. Shafler occupied the city. The capitu
lation embraced the entire eastern end of
Cuba. Tho number of Spanish soldiers sur
rendered was 22,000, all of whom were sub
sequently eonveved to Spain at the charge
of the United States.
Gratitude of the Nation.
The story of this successful campaign Is
told In the report of the secretary of war
which will bo laid before you. The Indi
vidual vnlor of officers and soldiers was
never more strikingly shown than In the
several engagements leading to tho sur
render of Santiago, while the prompt move
ments and successive victories won Instant
and universal applause. To those who
f;alned this complete triumph, which estab
lished the ascendency of the United States
upon land as the fight off Santiago had fixed
our supremacy on the seas, the earnest and
Instlnoygratltude of the nation Is unspar
ingly due. Nor should we alone remember
tho gallantry of the living; the dead claim
our tears, and our losses by battle and dis
ease must cloud any exultation at the re
sult and teach us to weigh tho awful cost
of war, however rightful the cause or sig
nal the victory.
MILKS AT PORTO RICO.
A Brief History of the Expedition
to That Island.
With the fall of Santiago, the occupation
of I'orto Rico became the next strategic
necessity. Gen. Miles had previously beer,
assigned to organize an expedition for that
purpuse. Fortunately he was already at
Santiago, where he had arrived on the 11th
of July, with reenforcements for Gen.
Shaffer's army. With these troops, consist
ing of 3,415 Infantry and artillery, two com
panies of engineers and ono company of
the signal corps, Gen, Miles left Guantana
mo on July 21, having nine transports con
voyed by the fleet under Capt. Hlgglnson,
with the Massachusetts (tlagshlp), Dixie,
Gloucester, Columbia and Yale, tho two
latter carrying troops. The expedition
landed at Guanlca July 25, which port wus
entered with little opposition. Here the
fleet was joined by the Annapolis and the
Wasp, while ths Puritan and Amphltrlts
went to San Juan and Joined the New Or
leans, which wa engaged in blockading
that port. The major general commanding
wa subsequently reenTorced by Oen.
Schwann's brigade of the Third army
corns, by Oen. Wilson, with a part of his
division, and also by Gen. Krooke. with a
t art of his corps, numbering In all lfl,!)73 of
ficers and men. On July 27 he entered
I'or.ce, q)na of the most Important ports In
the Island, from which he thereafter di
rected operations for th capture, of the
Isl-nd
With the exception of encounter with
the enemy at Guaynma, llermlguercs,
Conmo nnd Yauco, and an attack on a forco
landed at Cape Sen Juan, there wa no se
rious resistance. The campaign was prose
cuted with great vigor, and by the l?th of
August much of the Island was In our pos
session and the acquisition of the remainder
was only a matter of a short time. At
most of the points In the Island our troop
were enthusiastically welcomed. Protesta
tions of loyalty to the flag and gratitude for
delivery from Spanish rule met our com
manders at evarjr stage. Aa a potent In
fluence toward peace, the outcome of the
Porto Rlcan exiedltlon was of great con
sequence, and generous ct mmendatlon Is
due to tnose wno parucipuiou 111 11,
Fall of Manila.
The last scene of the war wns enacted at
Manila, Its starting place. On August IB,
after a brief assault upon the works by the
land forces, In whlcn tne squauron asstHieu,
the capital surrendered unconditionally.
The casualties were comparatively few.
Ttv this eonouest of the Phllllppine Islands,
virtually accomplished when tho Spanish
capacity for resistance was destroyed by
Admiral Dewey' victory of the 1st of
May, was formally sealed. To Gen. Mer-
rltt. hi omcers ana men tor meir uncom
plaining and devoted services for their gal
lantry In action, the nation Is sincerely
grateful. Their long voyage was made
with singular success, and the soldierly
conduct of the men, most of whom wero
without previous experience In the military
service, deserves unmeasured praise,'

ar.d 21 days from the surrender of Santiago,
tho United States troops commenced em

United States only two months.
Tribute te Patriotism.
It Is fitting thut I should benr testimony

largo portion of our army which, although
eager to be ordered to the post of greatest
exposure, lortunuteiy wus not rfejinred out

Spain In our note of July 30, with added

noon of August 12. M. Cambon, as the
plenipotentiary of Spain, and the secre

ing: The Protocol.
"Article 1. Spain will relinquish all claim
of sovereignty over and title to Cuba.
"Article 2. Spain will cede the I'nlted
States the Island of Porto Rico and other
islands now under Snanish sovereignty In

"Article 8. The United States will oc

Manila pending the conclusion of a treaty
of peace which ehall determine the con

Tlje fourth article provided for the ap

of the United States and Spain to meet In
Havana and San Juan, respectively, for
the purpose of arranging and carrying out
the details of the stipulated evacuation of
Cuba, I'orto Rico and other Spanish Is

The fifth article provided for the ap
pointment of not more than five commis
sioners on each side, to meet at l'arls not
later than October. 1, and to proceed to
the negotiations and conclusions of a
treaty of peace, subject to ratllloatlon ac
cording to the respective constitutional
forma of the two countries.
The sixth and last article provided that
upon the signature of the protocol hos
tilities be tween the two countries should ho

should be given as soon a possible by
each government to the commanders of lis
military and naval forces.
Hoatllltle Suspended.
Immediately upon the conclusion of tho
protocol I Issued a proclamation of August
12, suspending hostilities on the part ot the
United States. The necessary orders to
that end were at once given by telegraph.
The blockade of the ports of Cuba anel San

raised. On August 18 tho muster out of
100,000 volunteer, or as near that number
as was found to bo practicable, wa or

oon as we are In possession of Cuba and

OCR FOREIGN RELATIONS.
Aside from the War with Spain Their
Are Very Cordial.
With the esccptlon of the rupture with
Spain, tho Intercourse of the United States
with the great family of nations has been
marked with cordiality und the close of the
eventful year finds most of the issues that
necessarily arise In the complex relations
of sovereign states adjusted or presenting
no serious obstaclo to a Just ar.d honorable
solution by amicable agreemunt.
A long unsettled dispute as to the ex
tended boundary between the Argentine
Republic and Chill, stretching along the
Andean crests from the southern border of
tho Atacama tlesert to Magellan straits,
nearly a third of the length of the South
American continent, assumed an acute
stage In the early part of tho year and af
forded to this government occasion to ex
press the hope thnt the resort to arbitra
tion, already contemplated by existing con
ventions between the parties, might prevail
de spite the grave difliculties arising In Its
application. 1 am happy to Bay that ar
rangements to this end huve been perfect
ed, the questions of fact, upon which the
respective, commissioners were unable to
agree, being In course of reference to her
Britannic majesty for eletcrmiriutlon. A
risldual difference touching th northern
boundary line across the Atacama desert,
for which existing treaties provided no
adequate adjustment, bids fair to be set
tled in like manner by Joint commission,
upon which the I'nlted States minister at
Buenos Ayres ha been invited to serve as
umpire In the last resort. .
I have found occasion to' approach the
Arsrentine government with a view to re
moving dlflVrenyes of rato charges Im
posed upon the cables of ar. American cor
poration In vttio transmission between
Buenos Ayres nnd the cities of Uruguay
snd Brazil of through messages passing
from and to the United States. Although
the mntter Is complicated by exclusive con
cessions by Uruguay and Brazil to foreign
companies, there Is strong hope that a good
understanding will be reached and that the
Important channels of commercial commu
nication between the I'nlted States and the
Atlantic cities of South America may be
freed from an almost prohibitory discrim
ination. In this relation I may be permitted to ex
press my sense of the Illness of an In
ternational agreement whereby the inter
change of messages over connecting cables
may be regulated on a fair basis of uni
formity. The world has seen the postal
system de'-vc loped from a congeries Inde
pendent and exclusive service into a well
ordered union, of which all countries found
the manifold benellts. It would be strange
were the nations not In time brought to
realize that modern civilization, which
owes so much of Its progress to the anni
hilation of space by the electric force, de
mands that this nll-lmportnnt means of
communication, a heritage of all peoples,
to be administered and regulated In their
common behoof. A step In this direction
was taken when the International conven
tion of lwl, for the protection of subma
rine cables was signed, and the dav is, I
trust, not far distant when this medium for
the transmission of thought from land to
land may be brought within the domain
of International e-eincert completely a

Austrln-Ilungrary.
The sympathy of the American people
has Justly been offered to the ruler and
tho people of Austria-Hungary by reason
of the allllctlon that has lately befallen
the-m In the assassination of the tmpres
queen of that historic realm.
On the loth of September, 1S97, a con
flict took place at L.at;lmer, Pa., between
a body of striking miners and the sheriff
cf Luzerne county and his deputies, In
which 22 miners were killed and 44 wounded,
of which 10 of the killed and 12 of the
nounded were Austrian ar.d Hungarian
subjects. This deplorable event naturally
aroused the solicitude of the Austro-Hun-garlan
government, which, on the assump
tion that the kl. ling and wounding Involved
the unjustifiable misuse of authority,
claimed reparation for the BiifTerers.
Apart from the searching Investigation
and the peremptory action of the authori
ties of Per nsvlva hla. the federal exocn.
tlve took appropriate steps to learn the
merits of the case In order to be ln a po
sition to meet the urgent e-omplalnt of a
friendly power. The she rift and his dep
uties, having been Indicted for murder,
were tried and acquitted after protracted
proceedings and the hearing of hundreds
of witnesses, on the ground thnt the kill
ing was In tho line of their official duty to
uphold law and preserve public order In
tho state. A representatlvo of the de
partment of Justice atttialod the trials, re
porting Its course fully. With all the facte
In its possession, this government expects
to reach a harmonious understanding on
the subject with that of A ustria-Hungary,
not wlthstandirg the renewed claim of the
latter, after learning the result of the trial,
for Indemnity for Its Injured subject.
International Exposltlona.
Despite the brief time allotted for prep
aration, thu e xhibits of this country at the
Universal exposition at Brussels In 1SU7,
enjoyeel tho singular distinction of a larger
proportion of awards, having regard to
the number nnd rlusses of articles entered,
than those of other countries. The worth
of such a result In making known our na
tional capacity to supply tho world's mar
kets Is obvious. Exhibitions of this Inter
national chnrtietcr are becoming more fre
quent us the exchange of commercial coun
tries grows more Intimate and varied.
Hardly a year passe that this government
is nol Invited to national participation at
some Important foreign -enier, but often
on too short notice to permit ejf recourse
to congress for the power and means to do
so. My predecessors have suggested the
advisability of providing, by a general en
actment und n standing appropriation, for
accepting such Invitations and for repre
sentation of this country by a commission.
Thin plan hus my cordial approval.
Central American Affaire.
The year events in Central America de-
sorve more than passing mention. A
menacing rupture between Costa Rica and
Nicaragua was happily composed by the
signature of a convention between the
parties with the concurrence of the Guata
mnlan representative as a mediator, the
net being negotiated -and signed on board
the I'nlted State steamer Alert, then ly
