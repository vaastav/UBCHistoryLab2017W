ilioold my tlmt his example wu not whit Sc
itslioulil linvo been or might have been In R
the politics of either tho Democratic or Ho- Cf
publican parties, in both of which ho was at Hi
one time and another quite prominont. llo kl
followed politics an a pursuit in life, and was fr(
generally successful in turning up winner, of
lie deserted the regular Democracy in 1857 as
UcausoMr. Buchanan would not cither take
him into Ids Cabinet or make him editor re
of the Washington t'uion, at that time tho di
organ of the Democratic administration at T1
ll'uliington. Ho made Buchanan Presi- u[

"Sanderson side-door" operation In Penn- wi
ylvnnin, Sanderson being a conspicuous w!
Know .Nothing In Philadelphia, who was re- gr
ported to linvo sold out to Forney for a moniedconsideration.
Initio Kansas Nebraska ta

influence of Jeff Davis and other Southern no

Forney to desert to Douglas and establish to

to do something for Forney, nnd offered tit
him the Consulate to I,ivcr|tool, at that w<
time the licst appointment In tho gift of th
lhoGovcrmnont, but Forney wanted idghor in
recognition, which recognition was violently
opposed by Henry A. Wise, of
Virginia, and other Southern men, who w
remembered Forney's connection with w
the Jamison scandal and his do- 0(
tious ways in other directions. Ho
Bochsnan was obliged to give him the cold
shoulder, and Forney undertook togctevcn w

Wasiiixgtos, DeccmborW.?The attitude
f tho President regarding the approachng
Senatorial election in Virginia i? alged
to have been misrepresented greatly in
10 same wanner us bin views regarding the
lection of a Speaker were misrepresented
ist week. President Artliur bad no desire
i intluenco tho election of a Speaker,
nowing that the Uepresentatives were
ipablo of expressing their choice
ithout any suggestions or advice.
As regards tho election of a Senator from
irginto tho President has no choice hereon
the Republicans or Resdjustets. Tho
ill of the majority of tho members cornwing
the liberal party will undoubtedly
) expressed at the election, and bo it
iddloberger or Lewis or somo oilier man
ho is choson the President will be eotlresatislled.
The administration supports
ie coalition and not uny particular indldual
coui|K?ing it, except so far as indidual
services deserve recognition for
bor in tho cause, After tho groat victory
lost month it is not believed that the
jernl party will becomo invoiveu in n
ntroversy over tho election of a Senator
hich will destroy all the advantages
ined by tho overthrow of Bourbonism.

Postmaster General James will remain in
e Cahinetfintil the end of tho fiscal year,
asibly longer. Tho President is very
sirous that tho Postmaster General shall
mpleto the reforms which he has inaugu*
ted before insisting upon tho acceptance
his resignation. General Jnines left here
is evening for New York, where he will
main until Monday looking after business
tho department.
Tho mail facilities from Now York aro to
i still further improved if Gen. James
n mako the necessary arrangements.
At no ttmo of lata years havo tho proscts
for tho rostoUko Department to bemo
self-supporting been so bright as at
esont Tho receipts from the larger postices
are increasing rapidly each quarter.
TUB TARIFF TUSSLB.
Conversation with old members shows a
'ong impression umong thorn that the
riir question is going to work serious
jury to tho party lines before it is fully
ttled. Tho dauiago, however, will be
ore apparent in the ranks of tho Domestic
party than thoso of tho Republican,
r whilo tho formor has raised its banners
ith practical free trade branded
urcon, tho latter has bccomo tho high
riff party of tho country. In tho Domontic
party Senator Duller, Senator Voories,
Mr. Handall, Itandail L. Gibson, of
misiana, and others aro tariff men, whilo
nators Pendleton, Maxoy and Beck, and
?presentatives Cox, Belmont, Hewitt,
ifllilo Illuobtiiirn IfnnIL Vrnvnrs.
iringer, Holmar, Randolph, Tucker, Atns
nnd others aro tariff reformers and not
>o traders, The result of this difference
opinion isuseriotui disagreement already
to the policy to be pursued by tho party.
In tho Republican party there are few
formers, and wlmt there aro are being
scouraged in their projects for reform,
lere Is little doubt that Dunnell's position
ion that subject, nnd Kasson's welllown
lukewarinness, did much to
aken them In tho Speakership fight,
die Keifer'a strong protective proclivities
eatly strengthened him.
The mere mention of the matter of a
rllT revision in tlio President's message
is caused Republicans to find fault here,
id the subject cannot sccuro any patient
nsidcratlon. A strong party lender said
-day tlmt Wore, tho end of tills session
o Hcpublicnn party would bo Irrctriovay
committed to an iron-clad high protecro
tarlfr, while tho Democratic party
Diild be found so thoroughly disorganized
at several of Its leaders would find refuge
an Independent movement.

Senator Edmunds says he Bees no reason

itli Its business and adjourn by tho lotli
May.
Senator Cockrlll agrees with Senator Edunds
and says Hint all the business that
III bo dono can be gotten through with by
10 middle o( May.
"In my opinion," says the Senator,
[lie Republicans will keep us pretty closo
work. They want to set us an example,
id to that end wo will work up pretty
ose to the holidays, and they will not

Ju North Carolina the Democrats ar
not harmonious, and Republican* from
' lliere assert that many who were tTnlon
men during the rebellion are weary of
Democratic rule and ready to assist in in
overthrow. In Tennessee the Democrat*
are split over the debt question and low
lax, and are preparibg to tnalce a contest
an their own hoolc. In Arkansas the State
debt has rent the Democrats asunder, and
Ihe ruling element has about read the ropudlationiata
out of the party.
In Texas it ia represented that the antiDemocrats
bus not been showing itself,
but that It can be brought out by a liberal
movement. This is the substance of the
view as now taken bv the Republican leadera
here. The quiation now is to find suitable
leaders for an anti-Deinocrucy move- i
meiit In these States, and with the view of
inducing men of ability to take hold of
tlie Federal patronage that will be offered
as bait. 1

Ilouk, of Tennessee, is opposed to giving
tho olHce to any Democrat unless ho joins
Iho Republican party; but men who con- .
trol and direct the Republican policy are ,
determined to encourage independence In
the south in spito of tho Republican oppo- .
nit ion from that section. As yet, leaden ..
for tlio anticipated Independent movements
In most of tho southern .Suites Imvo
not been selected, but a conference consultation
and cornwpondonco are going on
to that end, and Mississippi is not overlooked.
Oeneral Fitipatrick, who run on tho re- c
cunt coalition ticket, is here for tlio pur- ^
pose of obtaining aid that will keep the _
Coalition party alive. Southern Demo- v
crats are aware of tlieae plans anil somo of '
them are undoubtedly uneasy sinco tho ro- ?
Btilt in Virginia.
An Arkansas Congressman says he does ,.
not believe the Republicans can mako a
union with tho dissatisfied Democrats in \
that State, because the iattei' are too much ..
nlrald of tho doniinanco of tlio colored .
race, lie believes that tho DemocrnUi will
come together on a compromise platform.
The Democrats aro also discussing plnns for
ne*t yeur's canvass, and a proml out Con- h
flresaman said to-night, "I won't go in tho $
llliht if llarnum has nnytliing to do with ti

Democrats from North and South denounce

can mako no headway toward cllicient or- o

the Southern Democrats o|ienly declare
that their party must pursue a mora liberal a

n great mistake woa. made in driving the o
Virginia Iteudjusters out of tho party, li
and they largely blame tho Bourbon i'

*St. Louis, Mo., December 0.?The ill
fated traiu which went down through the
St. Charles bridge, tho railroad bridge over
the Missouri river, last night, was freight
No. 12, eastward bound. By schedule, it
crosses just before the Wurrenton accommodation,
meeting tho latter at Brotherton,
and passihg. Tho engine, tender and
thirteen cars loaded with live stock, and
eighteen with other freightaud the caboose
went down. Three of the six men on tho
train when it started over the bridge accompanied
it on the wild leap of sixty-five feet
into tho river channel. That two of them
escaped to tell of their awful experience
Hceins a miracle. Five of the six are accounted
for, but one is missing Jack
Kirksbv, tho engineer, stuck to his post.
His body may still be in tlie cab. with his
hund on tho throttle, or it may liuve been
washed away, that being a mystery yet
unsolved. The ilreman, II. Chamberluin,
was by the side of Kirksby, but somehow
he was forced through tho cab window and
upon the top of tho wreck, just above the
surface of tho water, where he clung, calling
for help until Charles Kpinks and A. Dolau.
the latter u bridgo watchman, hud manned
a skill' and rescued him. I le was u tit subject
for a surgeon, both bones of the left
Kg below the knee being fractured. The
bmkeman, Charles S. Albinger, lives to bo ,
pointed out as the other of tho two men ,
who
went down into tiiat awful abyss. i
He was on the third car from the engine 1
and lie felt all giving way beneath him. '
Ho dropped Hat on top of tho cur and touched
tho foot board. Tho car ho was on
doubled over the ono in front and Htood out 1
of the water about half its heighth. His I
cries brought one of tho numerous skills,
manned as soon as tho alarm was given, 1
and he was brought ashore. Half u dozen >
cuts and some heavy bruises composed the I
extent of his injuries. 1 Ie was cared for ut 1
the (iult House and there it! every prospcct '
that ho will bo out soon. These were tho J
only men who accompanied tho train to its
destruction. Oblinger has a family at Mo- <
berly. Chamberlain's home is at Tyrone. '
Kirkbsy's bo<ly#if found, will be taken buck '
to Moberly. It was a long truin,

caboose. When tho engine was nearly 1
across the span which fell tho cuboose was 1
away back on spun No.!), just leaving tho
St, Charles side of the river. Tho span
which went down did so in its entirety. <

The bridge seemed to drop out from under
them in ono piece; down went tho j
forward third of the train, and then (
tho remaining fourteen cars followed
ho slowly that thoso who witnessed it say 8
that it seemed to almost stop. Car after cur t
toppled over the brink until not ono wns
left. A brakemun was on to]) of u cur, well g
towurd tho rear. Ho saw tho chasm yawn- \
ing, ju tuned to one side, caught the trestle t
work, climbed down and wulkcdbuckto t
the St. Charles side. No less sensutlonul i
was tho escupo of \V. 0. Anderson, of Put* c
tonsburg, Mo., and Put Crane, of Howard
county, two stockmen, and conductor Dur- i
Held, who were on tho cubooso. Tho sue- t
cession of jerks warned them, and they \
jumped off of the rear platform upon tho i
bridge and stood looking at the slowly dis- i
appearing train. Durtleld says that simul- 4
tuneously with tlie uneven motion of tho <
train came tho cry of Midcap, who shouted
to tho occupants of tho caboose. |
"fob ood's sake jump, hub's ooino down." J
A ferry boat dropped down to tho scene ,
of the wreck, but it was impossible to do |
anything. Skill's had already tuken off the ]

A reporter Interviewed Mr.BhalerSinith, *
who built tho bridge, last evening. Mr. a
Smith hud just returned from Chicago, and
when in St. l.ouia hu heard of tho accident. J"
Mr. Smith suid he could not Imagine what
liort of it had given way. lie knew it wus {*
the south deck link spun and that was all, 111
Dr he might be able to offor a theory. The J"
gentleman udded he was wholly taken by
urpriso when lie heard of the accident. *
lie had regarded the bridge sincc Its reconstruction
as one of tho safest in
the country. Tho floor was the
only part lliat he had considered
weak, previous to tho accident of '7U. Huv- 11
Ing reconstructed the floor after that acei lent,
Mr. Smith lind thought it Impossible ur
lor tho structuro to glvo way.
Mr. Edward Bates, an assistant of Mr. ["
Smith, wus nlao seen, but he too, had ">
nothing to offer. He, like his superior, re- ?
jarded the briilgo as one of tho strongest
itructures In tlm country, and was Ineredu- J"
Ions when he heard of Inst night's occllent.
Mr. Hales was unablo to conceive r0
liow one of tho spans could liavo given
