Revenue Officers Recover I lie
Cases Dropped from the Ciaelic.
San Francisco. December 9,—The
revenue cutter Richard Rush, with cus'
toms officers aboard, intercepted the
steamer Gaelic, bound from China, early
this morning outside of the heads. Two
boats were sent out from the cutter, and
as one of them came in sight of the
steamer, it was evidently mistaken by
some of those on board for a smuggler's
boat, for five large wooden cases were
lovered oautiously into the water right
in front of it. A line was made fast to
the cases, and they were taken in tow
by the boat. After the Gaelic wns
boarded by the officers she was allowed
to proceed. When examined, the oases
thrown overboad were found to contain
opium to the value of $5000.

Suicide.
Uonzai.ks, Cal., December 9.—At 9:30
o'clock this morning Henry Brockmann,
one of the oldest and most prominent
citizens of this place, committed suicide
by shooting himself through the head
w"ith a revolver. The cause was ill
health. Mr. Brockmann had just com
pleted a large two-story building for
hotel and bar-room, and some thought
that he had become heavily |involved.
At Ilia coronet's inquest, however, a let
ter was found, written yesterday, and in
German, addressed to his wife, which
showed that the suicide was premedit
ated and that ill health was the cause
of the rash act. Deceased was always
looked upon as being well fixed finan
cially, and the announcement of his
death brought forth many comments as
to the probable cause. He leaves a
wife and three children, besides many
warm friends, to mourn his loss,
Honing against Hope.
San Francisco, December 9.—The

Stanford Ins not abandoned the hope
that the Republican's of California will
elect a Republican successor to Senator
Williams. Still he says he has not con
sulted authorities as to the status of the
Seuate and the right of one-half of the
Senators to hold over under the Califor
nia constitution, but he believes there is
a good chance for the Long term Sena

if they should be confirmed in their
title, the Legislature would be Republi
can by a majority of two.

BEQUIHTS TO HARVARD.
Another Earthquake Shoek —Gen-
eral News From the
East.
\Sjjfcial to the HearUl by the Associated Prcsss
CHICAGO, December 9.—Commenting
on the appointment of Thos. Moonlight
as Governor of Wyoming, a Washington
correspondent of the Daily News tele
graphs: About six weeks ago there was
appoiuted to this place Mr. Baxter, a
young man who graduated at West
Point in '70, and after a few years' ser
vice iv the army he resigned to go into
the ranching business in that city.
Baxter is the son of ex-Governor Bax
ter of Arkansas, and recently married a
daughter of Mr. Maghee, the richest
man in Tennessee. Baxter was not a
candidate for the Governorship but came
here on his bridal trip and was in
troduced at the White House. He spent
several evenings with Mrs. Cleveland
and impressed the President so far that
the latter gave him the appointment;
but to-day, instead of sending Rixter's
name to the Senate, the President nom
inated Tom Moonlight, of Kansas, pro
fessional office holder and politician, As.
Moonlight was one of the eorl'cst set
tlers of Kansas, and as an Abolitionist
fought beside John Brown at Ossawat
amte, served through the war in a Kan
sas regiment, and wus afterwards elected
Secretary of State, fais appointment was
a surprise to Kansas people in Washing
ton. It was even a greater surprise for
the friends of Baxter, and they have
been to the White House aud to the In
terior Department to inquire bow
it happened. Baxter did not
seek the office, but has not
declined the claim. Ho took much
trouble to arrange his business affairs so
that ho could perform the duties of the
office. It is laid that the reason that
Governor Baxter was not nominated is
that he is a large cattle owner and that
his sympathies are with the ranchmen
who are fighting the government on the
fencing of public grounds. He arrived
here to night to protest agaiu t his sud
den removal. A Times' Washington cor
respondent ascribes as a reason for the
President appointing a successor to Bax
ter is th t Bjxter himself fenced in gov
ernment lauds.
A VIRUINIA HI 1111 l 11.
The murderess Confesses und
Convicts a Policeman.
Richmond, Va., December 9.— H. H.
During, the policeman who was arrested
last night on a charge of bribing Herman
Joel, watchmaker, a witness iv the Clu
verius case, was before the police court
but the examination was postponed till
the 18th instant. When considering
petitions for Executive clemency
in the c.se of Cluvcrius the Gov
ernor Bent for Joel and quel
tioned him in regard to the watch-key.
At the request of the Governor Joel des
cribed the interior of the watch key
which he had repaired for Cluverins I
aud afterwards opened it in the pres- ,
ence of the Governor. His description tal
lied exactly with the interior of the
watch key, aud at the trial the com
monwealth asked that the key be opened '
by Joel, but the counsel for the defense
objected. This was perhaps the strongest
point in the evidence against the pris
oner, and now since it has come to light
that the interior of the watch key wab
found as described by Joel, the evidence
of the prisoner's guilt is even more con
clusive. Chief of Police Poy to-day re
ceived from Superintendent Murray, of
New York, a letter containing the fol
lowing, which he had received:
December X, 1880.
Sri'KRINTHNDKNT MURRAY:
Dear Sir:—l am sorry that the au
thorities of Richmond are making a
great mistuke about the Cluverius case.
He is the wrong muu. Sorry he could
not prove an alibi. I had hoped he
could, and now there is nothing left for
me but to surrender myself as a murderer
of Lillian Madison. I will surrender ou
the morning of Cluveriu'a execution at
your headquarters. It is unnecessary to
give you further particulars, as my case
will show clearly about the murder at
my trial. 1 cannot wait any longer of
confessing my crime, as my conscienoe
has troubled me enough. I will prove
all when I surrender, and there is noth
ing left for me to do but surrender, got
a trial and probably hatg.

W. J. FLORENCE.
"The Ticket of Lcavt Jlann Lul
Night.
Last night at the Grand Opera House,
Mr. W. J. Florence appeared in Tom
T ivlor's drama, "The Ticket of
Man." This is the actor's tiist and per
haps greatest hit. Fe v play-goers in
any part of the Union have not seen it
some time or other. Florence is not so
young as when he first appeared as the
"Lancashire Lad." Still he plays this
very exigent role iv a decidedly artistic
and vigorous manner. He held the
house spell-bound last night in
tho many really pathetic and inter
esting situations developed in the
line idot. Miss Emma Lincoln made a
decided hit as "Mrs. Willoughby," as
she did on the previous evening as the '
"Nipper 'in "Doaibey and Sou." In
the first act Miss Florence Noble was
far from suited to the rule of the beggar
girl. In the other scenes she retrieved
herself. Mr. Earle Stirling as "Melter
Mom" was excelleutly made up, and acted 1
well, but he forgot to maintain his ac- 1
cent with anything like consistency. ,
As a matter of interest to the fair sex

Mis. Florence haß a superb collection of ,

A necklace of four strands of Sicilian I
pearls is fastened In front by a clasp com- .
posed of numerous seed diamonds. A dia' 1

eral rings and a number of bncelets lay on i
the dressing table. The till of a large trunk ,
I was divided Into two apartments. One of

WASHINGTON.
The House and Senate
Railroad Bills.
ELECTORAL COUNT BILL.
Chance for Coast Appropriations-
Star Routes Changed—Sweet
Wine Bill.
\Sitecial to the Herald by the Associated Press |
Washington, December 9.—The con
ference upon the inter-State commerce
measures, popularly known as the Rea
gan and Cullom bills, reached an agree
ment to-day upon the differences be
tween the Senate and House. The re
port of the Conference committee will
be presented as soou as it can be pre
pared and signed, and its adoption will
bo asked at an early date. Bills passed
by the Senate and House propose differ
ent plans for the regulation of inter-State
traffic of the country. Both prohibit
unjust discrimination between persons I
and places, the giving of special rates,
preference, etc., as well as certain prac
tices which are declared to be unlawful ;
Both bills require railroads to publish 1
their rates, and to adhere to them when
published. They did not differ materi- ]
ally in the penalty provided for viola
tion of their general provision, but they
differed widely iv the methods prescrib- '
ed for securing their enforcement. The
House bill* gives every shipper with a
grievance the right of action in State
and United States courts, on his motion '
andinhisoun behalf, and the recovery ,
of damages be may hays sustained,
with the provision that a reasonable at
torney fee should be allowed in every
case of recovery. The Senate
bill did not preclude shippers
from inßtiiuting suits in their
own behalf, but it provided for the
creation of a commission whtch will be
required to investigate all complaints '
made and to settle them by aibitration,
if possible, if not, to prosecute the case
in the courts, when they find that the
shippers arc entitled to redress. By a
compromise which has been agreed
upon, Congress proposed to put both
tbe-e plans of regulation into operation, .
an tto retain the remedial features of
both bills. They will recommend
that the Houso agree tb
the commission system, as it
stands in the Senate bill, and that the J
Senate agree to the provision allowance
to such shippers as may elect to do so, ,
to prosecute suits for the recovery of
damages in the United States Court on
their own behalf with provisions they
shall not have the right to pursue their
remedy in courts and through the com
mission in the same case. Upon one .
vexed and much debated question, long
and short haul, a compromise has been j
agreed upon. The House bill .
absolutely prohibited greater charge
for a shorter than for a (
long distance which iDcludeß a shorter
Upon any one railroad a provision in the
Senate bill prohibited greater charge for ,
shorter than for longer distances under
substantially similar circumstauces and
conditions over the name line on the ,
same direction and from the same origi- (
nal point of departure, or to the same i
point of arrival. It also authorized the ,
Commission to make exception to this i
general rule iv special cases in
which it seemed proper. A
substitute seciion, agreed to by
conferees makes it unlawful for any rail
road to charge more for a transportation '
of passengers of like kind, or of property i
under substantially similar ciicum- 1
stances and conditions for shorter than
for longer distance over tho same line i
and in the same direction, the shorter i
being included within the longer, i
with the proviso that in special
cases upon application and after i
investigation the commission may pre- ]
scribe to the extent which such rail- 1
road shall be relieved from the opera- i
tions of this section. The House bill !
contained an absolute prohibition of I
pooling, while the Senate bill provided i
for an immediate investigation by a com- i
mission of the question and legislation I
upon the subject. As upon this point
the Senate conferees have yielded and
accepted the provision of the House bill.
Following is the provision in full:
That it shall be unlawful for any com j
mon carrier subject to the provisions of
this act to enter into any contract, agree
ment or combination with any other [
common carrier, or carriers, fer pooling
freights of different and competing rail- .
roads so as to divide between
them the aggregate or net pro
ceeds and earnings of snch railroads,
or any portion thereof, and in
any case in agreement for pooling
freights aforesaid each day of its con
tinuance shall be deemed a separate of
fense. Upon the question of the pub
licity of rates there was no difference of
opinion. The House bill required each
railroad to publish and to adhere to its
rates between points upon its own line.
The Senate bill raatle it the duty of
the commission to alsoenforoe the publi
cation ef such through rates as it might
be found possible to publish. A substi
tute has been agreed upon by which
each railroad is required to print and
keep in every depot for inspeotion the
public rates it may establish between
points upon its own line. They are also
required to file with the commission
copies of all joint tariffs of through
rates to which they may be
party, and the commission will
be required to secure publication
of such through rates as far as may be
found practicable under modifications, of
m nor importance, have been made, bnt
these are the principal ones upon which
the difference of opinion existed. When
the substitute bill has been printed the
Commission will go over it carefully and
may find it necessary to make some
chauges, but they have substantially
agreed upon their recommendations.

Bonanza Hill.
The lively interest manifested in the
operations on BOMBM Hill has assumed
a different complexion from the excite
ment cau; ed by hearing of frequent and
rich strikes of ore deposits by the lucky
lessees. The property owners of a large
portion of the town, from Ike Neel's to
the upper end of the main
street, are manifesting a personal
as well as an anxious interest in the
contest between the two parties claim
ing the property under the different
names of Silver Monument ami Jennie
Lind. It is rumored around town that
tho Jennie Lind Compauy are preparing
to make applications for a patent, and
should they succeed in getting it the
property of about one-half of tho town
would belong to that company; but it
is thought that the protests will be so
numerous and strong that the par
ties who may be adjudged by the
courts as the lawful owners of the
property in dispute, will fail to get a
patent. Before there will be any exist
ing cause for anxiety it will have to be
settled in regard to the title, which at
present stands in about this shape: D.
M. Harwood claims that lie located the
ground before the Jennie Lind locators
did, but reoorded it a day or two after
wards. The prospects of lively and in
teresting litigations between the present
claimants to the mining property and
the numerous residents on the name and
the lucky owners in quite promising.—

Special 1,1 lite Herald by the Anociatcd Pre—.
London, December !).—The crc»s-ex
aniiuation of Lord Colin Campbell, de
fendant in the Campbell divorce cue,
wax continued to-day. lie was asked
whether having heard the evidence he
still alleged his wife had been criminally
intimate wilh Dr. Bird, at CadogM
Place, at the house in Brook street and
Leigh Court, and answered that he ml
leged that was the question that ought
to be submitted to the jury. This re
ply produced a sensation. Plaintiffs
counsel then announced that the cross
examination was concluded. The Judge
asked Lord Colin whether he bud ever
been guilty of familiarities with Mary
Wataon, aud he answered none whatev
er. Surgeons Properti and Allirgham
testified that they had heard v descrip
tion of the ailments from which Lady
Colin suffered in 1881-2, and that it was
not of a nature to prevent her from do
ing wrong. At this poiut it w.s an
nounced tuat Lord Coliu Campbell's side
of the case was concluded.
Duke Marlborough's counsel opened
for the defense, and said the Duke, fear
less ot threats, would appear as witnea
aud swear the charges were groundless.
The alleged case against ihe i- uke oen
sistsd ot ordinary incidents. Toe small
talk of society had been turned into im
propriety, and the only exceptions were
the incidents of Purilee and Leigh Court.
He would treat of those especially.
Even if the Puitlee and Leigh Court al
legations were true, could the jury say
there had beeu adultery. In reltienee
to the Leigh Court's charges they rested
upon the evident: > of Rose Batr, whom
nobody could trust.
The Dukes counsel declared that
Lady Campbell and the Duke did not
occupy adjoining rooms at Leigh Court.
Lord Colm new the facte of the Pal flee
incident long before the last trial, yet
lie then stated he had no suspicion
against his wife. If Lady Colin bad
beeu guilty of adultery sue could not
obtain judicial separatism. If Lord Coliu
vtas honorable how could he now, with
out furthtr evidence bring this trumped
up charge. Counsel admitted Lord
Blauforu was at Puiflee, but declared
he was there a one. Lady Campbell
would account for every hour ot tut
time between Saturday August lih, and
Monday August I4th. He trusted the
jury was not prejudiced against Duke
Marlborough on account of his
previous appearance in a divorce
court. He had not opposed Lord
Aylesford, on the contrary he made
what amen s he could by offering to>
marry Lady Aylesford and of settling
10,000 pounds on her child. Guilty, on
bebalf uf Captain Shaw, said his client
would deny upon oath that he ever bad
improper ivla.ions with Lady Campbell.
The story uf O'Neill was au absolute
fabrication. Captain Shaw was an old
friend of the lady's family and a man of
unsullied life. The Court here ad
