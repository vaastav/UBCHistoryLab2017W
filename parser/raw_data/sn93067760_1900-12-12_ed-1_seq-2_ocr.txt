Current Events.
The Republican Congress is pushing
things--giving Democrats little time
for ta k and protest. The army bill and
the ship subsidy aro pot measures. . n
army of a 100,000 and nine millions 8
year to ships as a 'onus to steamers
carrying the mails to foreign countries.
The committee, ways and means, pro
pose to reduce the taxes forty millions,
whlh the Democrats insist on sixty. |
There is war talk between Portugal
and Holland about a small matter and
the several ministers La\ been with
drawn. The quet n of the Dutch is just
passing .ier terns and about to cele
brate her nuptials and the quarrel is at
an awkward time, but the Dutch will
bo an over-match for the Southerners.
The commission having in charge
the Nicaragua canal report226 millions
as the probable cost. The figures are a
littlo'st irtling, but they call Ibis the
great Republic and Uncle San, has a
stout Btomaoh.
The Senate promptly passed the Bill
giving the South Carolina Charlestion
Exposition a quarter of a mil ion and
the House will probably follow suit.
In the Senate, Executive session,
Morgan, of Alabama, discussing the
Isthmian canal, favored nout'-a'itv by
this government und opposed fortify
ing it (Tl > British Lion would lash his
tail and roar.) It would he war. But
Morgan 's a peg-leg eonfedand insisted
that wc are not afraid. But a better
way would bo to i nveigle the English
ers to I ui d the canal at a half billion.
We could then seize it, drive thes-i Is- I
landers from the ocean, sink their
uiighty men of war, seize on their West
and East Indian possessions and the
earth and all that is therein is "ourn."
Should the poor English protest and
we no. ded money. Armour of the sau
sage business, Rockfol ow of our oil and
lighting department and nrnegie, of
the steel monopo y, would mak j things
to run as smooth as oil.

The President's Message.
Tho President under the constitu
tion Is required from time to time, to
deliver to Congress his recommenda
tions as to the needs and condition of
the country. His message sent down
to Congress on the 3rd Is very full, en
couraging in some r. ppectP. doleful and
gruoM.ine in others. He congratulates
the country upon its mighty expansion
and prosperity, und then plunges i-ito
a historj of the Chinese troubles. The
storj re. da i;ke novel and it is only
the ti'sL chapter, us the problem is
still unsolved. He wants an army of
from GO 000 to 100,01 0 to keep the peaco
In the Philippines and for contin
gences. The credit of the country is
mighty, the treasury growing, and he
recommends a fractional reduotlon in
taxes. He gestures at true**, but does
cot expect Banna to take, the hint. As
a republican, speaking from a repub
lican standpoint the President Is in
high good humor and vaults into the
new century upon a high horse. The
paper is very business like and per
functory no line writing, with strong
ear mark.- of 'innocuous desuetude."
Things are left to party managers
large.y. McKinley will allix his Signa

that time to the Iirst day of October
the Auditor's and Treasurer's dupli
cate have to be completed and an ab
stract of the work in the Comptroller
General's oflice by that time, which
will show at a glance that tho Auditor
has no time to take returns, or any

all taxpayers will make their returns
in time.
