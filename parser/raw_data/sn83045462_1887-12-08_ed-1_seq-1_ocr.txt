THE TARIFF MESSAGE.
Position of tiie Tobacco Kiatn Demo
crat*.
THKT ARE BWOMWfl RKCONCUED TO TUB VIEWS OF
THE PRESIDENT?TflB NEW TARIFF BILL TO CON
TAIN A CLAUSE REPEALING TH* TOBACCO TAX.
The surprise on the part of some members of
Congress and the general uncertainty occasioned
by the first reading of the President's message Is
wearing off. The complete laying aside of the
much-ta.ked-of repeal or the tobacco tax, startled
u'xl frightened some of the democrats from to
bacco-growing states, but they an? coming ro see
that this does not imply party opposition
to the repeal of that tax. As a flrst '
proposition the President, SpealcerCarllsle,and Ue
tarlfl reformers generally opuose any meddling
with the present internal-revenue tax, which Is
placed upon things which are luxuries, or worse.
J nev win oonsMer the question of repealing the
tobacco tax as a compromise In exchange for some
concession from the other side. as was stated tn
1 he Stak at the time, the President, In discussing
the question with Messrs. Carlisle und Scott aua
secretary halrchlld at Oak View last summer, took
a position luopponition to the repeal or the tobacco
tax, but thought that the Ctriff reformers could
consent to It lo secure taritT reductions. That
was decided upon as a thing to be done
In sending his recom mendat Ions to con
gress. however, the President dealt with
what he thought ought to tie done, not what he
was wil.ing should l?e. and thought might be
n.?, \il?h ST. kno.^le2?? that Mr- Carlisle was
the man with whom the President consulted while
preparing his message, the message is read in con
nection with Mr. Carlisle's speet-b on taking the
chair, and the tobacco m m are content. They re
member thai the most I hey ever expected from the
President was that he would say not hlng on the sub
ject of tobacco, and as t ie matter stands the mes
sage will no*, drive away any of the Virginia or
North Carolina mem tiers.
The understanding is that the tariff bill brought
forth as a party measure will include the repeal of
the tobacco tax, and this Is satlsiactory to many
of Mr. Randall's followers.
The Recent domination*.
RCMORED OPPOSITION TO MR. VILAS?TUB CAS* OP
MR. LAMAR?NO OPPOSITION TO MR. DICKINSON.
There is a rumor about the Senate wing of me
Capitol that the continuation of Mr. Vilas as
Secretary of the Interior may encounter opposi
tion. The only ground for opposition mentioned
Is the fact that a brother of Mr. Vilas Is said to be
Interested In certain land matters tn California
which were held up by commissioner Sparks be
cause of irregularity. There is nothing said Against
Mr. \ lias personally, but the fact that be would
be required lo pass upon claims In which bis I
brother is interested is cited as offering reasons
for opposition. The democratic Senators do i
not believe there will be any opposirion.
1 hey pronounce the reported ground or objection
as puerile. It now looks as ft all the pending
nominations will be referred to committees, ana
that of Mr. Vilas will go to the Judiciary commiv
tee.
With regard to the nomination of Mr. r.?mnT jt
Is now probable that in the consideration of the
case by the Judiciary committee, when appointed,
the question of his age may be raised as an objec
tion. If any opposition is manifested ft will be
confined to the question of age, as his ability and
qualification* are conceded, and It is now deemed
improbable that any Senator will go back nearly a
quarter of a century to Und jiolliTcal acts In his
record to bring up against him. It Is said that at
least three republican Senators who will be on the
Judiciary committee favor Mr. tamer's nnmi^
tlon.
The nomination of Mr. Dickinson for Postmaster
General will meet with no opposition.
*o Action in the Faulkner Cue,
BUT IT IS CONCBDBb THAT BB WILL SOON GST IIS SEAT '
IN THE 8BNATB.
The report telegraphed from Washington that
the members of the senate committee on elections
had unanimously agreed to the promp*. admission
of Mr. Faulkner as Senator from West Virginia,
Mr. Lucas having "failed to make out a case," is
premature, to say the least. There Is no commit
tee on elections yet under the rules of the senate
to pass upon the case, jt is true that all those
who composed that committee tn the last Congress
i are now senators, and It is presumed that they
will constitute the new committee; but the mem
bers of the old committee have not passed upon
the case. They have no more authority to do so
t ban any other senators of the same number. There
seems to be no doubt anywhere of the early
admission of Mr. Faulkner. Republicans and
democrats generally agree that, as the choice of
the state legislature, he is the Senator. But the
Senate cannot dispense with any of the legal ob
servances and formalities In settling the case, as
a matter of precedent it is necessary to proceed
with deliberation, and it Is admitted that Mr.
Lucas has a right to be heard. On the Drat day ot
the session Mr. Faulkner waa given the right to
the floor pending the decision of his case, and the
tact tnat he has been seen in his seat has led to a
rumor that be bad been seated. It is underwood
that the case will be taken up Just as soon as the
committee Is organized.
To a Stab reporter, who inquired or Senator
Kenna it anything had been done In the Faulkner
tbe8eu*ior replied: "That report (that
Faulkner's case had been decided) la based upon

The dull gray light ot a cloudy day pervaded the
Congregational church this morning, and at the
hour ot 9 o'clock the scattered groups of the dele
gates to the Evangelical Alliance could not be
seen very clearly. There was an early morning
air about the gathering and the delegates came In
slowly. The second day s session, therelore. did
not begin promptly at the hour announced in the
program. Before the presiding ofllcers and
speakers appeared the seats on the floor of the
church reserved for the delegates were being filled
up rapidly, however, and In the galleries there
were a great many spectators. The ladles seemed

he, thought, would not entirely cure bad homes,
and a mistake Is made lu carrying on temperance'

as a greater evil than even the great curse of in

,The reading or the paper was listened to with at
tention and applauded at Its close.
THE SOCIAL TICK.
In introducing the reader of the next paper Mr.
Justice Harlan said that the subject, "The Social
Vice," was not au agieeable one, but in its lin
P?'.tan^ "hi bearing upon great social problems
it was worthy of great consideration. He then In
troduced C0LJ.UGtvene.of Hartrord,coun.,\vho Is a
fP6^' ? ? rorc,,'le style and clear enunciation,
f^h^anwjth a general statement of the relation
of the individual to society, and maintained that
a true conception could not be had or man as a
unit. He spoke of the family and It s fundamental
nature in the social world. Every spei-ies of dls
order in society and lawlessness in man attacked
thetonlly. ar>d he said that the anarchist recog
nlted that the family must tlrst be destroyed be
his Ideas could Income prevalent. He said
that the production aud nurture of the individual
was possible under the best circumstances only in
the family.
th? bond op the family,
the speaker thought, was the pure affection and
unselfish devotion of husband and wife and father
and mother, a union springing from base consid
erations or from passion could not result in the
family In the highest sense of that word. He spoke
of the evil influences which surrounded the family
like a cloud, and said that doors stood open to al
?JiTAf our Rf,ns. an<l' he tempters Jostled
Usjn the public streets. He referred to indecent
?? .vuv?? "a me c?iw w ii it'u ne saiu
of. The speaker then
described the evil influences of the promiscuous
mingling brought about in J
THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS.
It was in this way that children became familiar
with forms of vice, and used language which per
haps they did not. understand. Parents, he thought,
whne carefully guarding the home influences, sent
their children, without thought of the conse
quences or without proper appreciation of the
possible malts, to the public schools and sub
jected them to the associations there. The speaker
tlicu referred to the evil of the sensational litera
ture which was now so prevalent. He said t hat
the newspaper of the sensational character divides
the field with the novel. If such newspapers had
no special subject to advocate they gathered from
?very source the gossip and scandal of the world.
He spoke also of
THE PRCRIKNT TENDENCIES OF ABT.

What shall the child think of thlt*?that there Is
one law for one and a different law for the other.
He spoke of the astounding facility of divorce In
many States, the marriage being regarded by
law as merely a civil contract, the minister who
performs the ceremony being looked upon only as
the marrying officer of the law. The anarchists
represent, he said, only the errors that taint
largely the great body or foreigners in the coun
try who have come to regard law as the repre
sentative of tyranny. Free love, abolition of mar
riage, separation at will of others, 1h their view of

Mr. Simeon t Baldwin, of New
the next speaker, ref<>rrlng to the sacred teach
ings of the Bible regarding the family and dlvo-ce,
asked what church had best observed and ruarded
thlssacrvd law. Xo church, he said. represensed
Id this conference, but the older Christian cburrh
with Its head at Rome, lie was sorry that in this
conf'rence he had listened to unkind words re
specting this old Christian church.
"I object to that,'- sal a a niemb-r sitting in the
rear of the halt "I dout believe It Is a Christian
church at all."
This Interruption caused a burz of excitement.
"That Is exactly the sentiment," said Mr. Bald
win, "that I have beard uttered from this plat
form, and against which I protest. in my work
with Mr. Dike in the divorce-reorm league, I have
found no truer friend than the Koinau Catholic
Church, one of t he great Mends to the cause ox
Roclal advancement is the Roman Catholic Church.
It guards the family. It guards the home, it guards
the child. We ought to make friends with the
Roman Catholic Cuurch, an l unless we do it, we
reject one of the great factors in the cause of the
advancement of Christ.
| POSITION OF THE ALLIANCE TOWARD TU CATHOLIC
CBUKCH.
When Mr. Baldwin sat down Mr. Dodge said he
was sorry Mr. Baldwin had wo entirely mistaken
the sentiment of the Alliance on this question. He
knew of no one who had not profound respect for
the piety, for the good done by the Roman catho
lics. The only word spoken nere was that we did
not believe In allowance to a foreign power, a pnn
ple that has no sympathy whatever with our ad
vancement."
Mr. Dodge was here Interrupted by prolonged
applause.
"That principle," h? continued, "has no sympa
thy whatever with our advancement as a republic
or as a Christian nation. Against their attack ou
our public schools or any of our Institutions we
ftrotcst, but. for them as christians we have noth
ng but lore and sympathy. We will aiwavs
welcome their assistance, ainl we will defend with
our heart's blood rights for them that we claim
for ourselves."
Again t he conference broke out In applause.
Rev. Drs. Williams, of Baltimore, and Crosley,
of Philadelphia, spoke on the same subject.
I'resident Jno. Eaton,
1.1. D., now of Marietta,
ohlo. formerly a weii
known resident of this

commissioner of educa

jrVliavtng r-ferred toStails
w tics showing that H per
cent or white voters and
JNO. Katon, a ?7 per cent of the colored
voters m this country were illiterate, he spoke of
the political dangers threatened by such tai ls. In
eleven states the illiterate voters outnum
bered the votes cast by either of the politi
cal part'es. It these voters could be united
they could take control of le relation. He com
menced also on the economic tvlationsof illiteracy.
The illiterate laborer was more likely to become a
pauper or criminal. Of the population over ten
years of age IT per cent were Illiterate. There
were more than six million here who could not
communicate with tliejr fellow men by writing,
in vain for ti?<>se millions thy established llbra
j rles and distributed Blblesor troets. The sabbath
work In churches was mainly lor the intelligent.
. From t he benighted homes of illiteracy It was not
j difficult for the saloon and the brothel to secure
! Its recruits. Thev needed inore caretul surveys of
I social condition* The laws of sanitation were
j oi'en neglect-d In the home of the ignorant, and
diseases were generated acd spread in pestilence.
' Immorality was no less communicable.
To add to the peril of th" millions of Illiterate
among us come thousand* from abroad, come
without knowledge of the Protestant Christian
freedom of this land, come to get gain as the
chin man comes, or destroy, as the anarchist
comes. More careful surveys of social facts are
needed. Decent society anywhere would be sur
prised to know its own exposures.

MORAL ILLITKKATErt.
Mr. Nicholas Murray Butler spoke after Gen.
Eaton finished. He said tliasgie regarded It also
as Important to consider what he called "moral
illiterates," persons who could not read the dif
ference between right and wrong. He deplored
that all moral instruction was being excluded
from the pub ic schiols. Young men were sent
j out Into the world moral illiterates, a class by
! whom moi danger was threatened than by the
Intellectual illiterates. He thought there was a
ray of hope in the introduction into th? scho Is of
manual training, la this, at least, pupils learned
the value of truth.
At noon a recess was taken, the gathering being

Later she was in her back yard when she heard
the officer In the rear of her premises. He said to
her, "How's h.ts?" She asked, "What hits?" He
answered, "Foley, ol course." She said, "You
know so much about It you must write and play
Ooth.'' After some further talk, complainant
alleges, the officer jumped the fence, broke open
the door, and arrested her. she said tnat while in
the house the officer Knocked her down and kicked
her, and that she has been unable to use her left
arm since. The officer said nothing to her about
ashes being thrown in the alley. Eliza Mills and
Emma Jackson, colored, testified to welng the
officer Jump over Mr. Field's fence.
Louis Fields, father of complaining witness, tes
tified that, his daughter had suffered irom rheu
matism in the left arm. The officer jumnod the .
fence, broke open his back door, followed his
daughter upstairs, and broke open her bed-room
door. Witness saw the offieer strike his daughter

assaulted her sister on the street and knocked her
down.
The defendant testified that on the 30th of No
vember, the day of the alleged assault, he Waited
the rear of the Fields' house to look for ashes and
garbage. He asked Cornelia Fields about a pile of
garbage, and she called him a "d? pimp," and
was very boisterous. He Jumped the fem-e and
Slaced her under arrest. She wanted to get her

the assault and profanity, and said that the
younger sister was the only one who used profane
language.
Several officers testified to the good character of
the defendant.
Mr. snepperd offered In evidence the records of
the court, showing that the colored persons were
acquitted of the charge made against them by the
officer.
Mr. Frank P. Closs, for the officer, argued that
the testimony had not made out a case against the
officer, and that he should be acquitted.
Mr. shepperd, for the Government, said that un
less the court thought that three witness for the
prosecution had perjured themselves, the defend
ant would certainly be guilty of the offense
charged.
Iu disposing of the case Judge Snell said: "The
officer had no right, because she used saucy lan
guage, which be had Invited, to arrest her. He
had no foundation for entering the house, as no
offense had bees committed. There is no founda
tion for the arrest. The defendant is guilty of
the charges against him. The court has no doubt
the officer thought be was right when he tnade the
arrest. The defendant is round guilty of profanity
and sentence is suspended, and for the assault be
Is fined lltt." Mr. Clous noted an appeaL

The WIK?1-growers and wooi-dealef*, In their
answer to tbe President's views on the wool lntar
eaca, declare "that the sentiments of tbe m 1 ? aya
are a direct atta? k upon their Industry, and IB
posiuve violation of the national democratic plat
form of ISM; that the argument made tot Um
removal of our protection against foreign compe
tition Is tbe old one, repeatedly rna je b> the eaa
m'.es of our Industrial |?rotrress. and an tnoroughiy
disproved by the logic of facts and dern >nsi rauoa
of experience and nisi or] as to need no answer.?*
They say: "Alarmed at bis position, we make an
appeal trout his re<-omtnet>datlons to tbe peopln
? v ? for the maintenance of the America*
poller of protection, to which the country la In
debted lor its unexampled development and prua
pertty." They nually claim that -the President*
policy would bring about the destruction of Iks
wool industry, and the same policy o< reduction of
abolition of the tariff would end la disaster to all
the other industrial productive enierprlsfw ot Ua
country."
