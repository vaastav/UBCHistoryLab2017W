started to the cellar for coal, taking with
her a lighted lamp. At the cellar door she
requested Mrs. Phipps, who was In the
room to hold the lamp. No sooner had she
opened the door than natural gas rushed
out, and was ignited from the lamp in Mrs.
Phipps hands. A terrific explosion en

wrecking the three buildings. There
is a six-inch main of natural gas running
along Grant street, but no connection with
the houses on that square. The gas proba
bly escaped from the main and found its
way to the cellars. The noise of the explo
sion was heard for squares away, and cre
ated the greatest excitement. Sheets of
flames burst from the windows, doors and
sides of the wrecked houses. From within
were heard the screams of terrified
women and children. Several men forced
their wav throueh the fire into Mrs.
Meehan's nouse, where a terrible sight

was Mrs. Phipps wrapped in flames. Both
women were picked up and carried from
the burning buildinsr. It was found that
Katie Griffin was burned beyond hopes of
recovery. Bhe was removed to tne tioin
eopathic Hospital, where she is now lying
unconscious. Mrs. Phipps was severely
burned, but her injuries are not considered
fatal. On the upper floor of Mrs. Meehan's
house were eieht women and children; in

were rescued with difficulty, but all were
finally taken out uninsured except Mrs.
Favilla and voune Case. who. were quite
seriously hurt by falling debris. Mean
while the flames gained such headway that
the three-story brick, building was com
pletely destroyed. The other houses were
not entirely burned, but so badly wrecked
by the concussion that ,it will probably be
necessary to tear them down. The loss to
property will reach to about 30,000.
PECULIAR AILMENT.
Eighteen Gallons of a Milky Fluid Drhwn
From a Man's Stomach.
Chicago, December 4. Dr. James M.
Hutchinson, one of the surgeons of the
Cook County Hospital, last Tuesday pen
formed a peculiar surgical operation, which
he thus describes: "A young man of thirty-
live years was taken to his mother's home
sick In a peculiar way. I was called to see
him. He had led the rapid life of a bache
lor who seldom goes borne, and ne bad a
fat, pouchy stomach on him. 1 made
an incision and drew off three quarts of
milky white fluid. I could not account for
it I could find no light in medical litera
ture. I kept tapping him, and in twenty
' seven days drew off eighteen gallons of the
strange fluid. He was dropsical, but why
the fluid was milky white I could not tell.
I decided upon an investigation, and on
Tuesday I made an incision in the abdo
men. I drained him out and made an
nneninir six inches in lentrth. la vine the in
testines bare. They looked natural, but I
reached in after bis liver and found a ma
lignant sore, cancerous I should say. Then I
went for his spleen and found it
adhering to the abdominal walls. But this
did not account for the milky color of the
secretions, and I traced up the lacteal duct,
which empties into left sub-clavical vein.
and found a rupture. The fluid, instead of
going to nourish the body, had been going
to color the matter in the abdominal cavi
ty. I was satisfied. I closed up the open
ing in the duct, washed the man out, car-
boiized him, stitched up the opening, but
left a vent tube, and the man will got well.
BLOODY BALLOTS.
Riots In England Over the Election Can
didates Beaten to Death.
London, December 4. The excitement
caused by the closeness of the election is
tremendous. Four deaths from excite.
ment caused by politics are reported.
Riots are the order of the day. Mr. Charley,
the defeated Tory candidate against Baron
Rothschild, in the Aylesbury Division of
Bucks, lies dying at a local hotel, from in
juries received at the bands of tbe mob.
Twenty residences of Tories and the two
chief hotels at Radstock, Somerset, have
been stoned. Scores of citizens and police
men have been injured at Worthing, where
the police were stoned. Fifty casualties
are reported at Wilton. The successful
Liberal candidate there was beaten black
and blue. Only by the aid of an escort of
sixty policemen battling their way to the
' station did he escape being thrown into the
river.
NOT HEART DISEASE.
Mr. Hendricks' Old l'liyslclan Gives the
Cause of His Death.
Bridorport, 111., December 3. A promi
1 neht physician, who was Mr. Hendricks'
friend and attendant for a longer period
than any other, states that Mr. Hendricks
did not die of heart paralysis, as stated bv
Indianapolis reports. He states that several
years ago mr. uendncKs was stricken
with paralysis. From this he never
fully recovered. His father having died
from degonerated blood vessels, the most
rational explanation of the paralysis is
that an artery of the brain burst. In a
couple of years he was attacked with senile
gangrene of the toes, a disease caused by
degenerated blood vessels. After his toe
sloughed off he recovered. Later ho dies
KUddenly; the cause supposed by one physi
cian to be heart failure and another to be
brain clot.

TERRIFIC EXPLOSION.
A Tag Boat Blown to Atoms In the East
River With All Hand on Board.
New York, Pecember 3. At about six
o'clock this evening, while the tugboat
Dora Emory was towing a stons barge up
the East River, her boiler exploded oppo
site Sixtieth street. The report of the ex
plosion was heard at least two miles, and a
number of boats put off to render assist
ance, but no trace of the tug could be
found, and it is believed that she sank im
mediately with all hands. Tbe barge was
taken in tow and made fast to a pier on
Bluckwell's Island. The search for
the tug and its crew was continued for
some time, but no trace of either was
found. Persons near the scene of the ex
plosion say the tug was blown to pieces
and all on board were lost, rontons living
along the river front describe the explo
sion as terrific. The windows of many
houses in the neighborhood were com
pletely shattered. Several buildings were
badly shaken, and for a time great excite
ment prevailed. Horace A. Green, a deck-
no nd employed on tne steamer Franklin
Edson, which was about 250 yards
distant, savs that immediately after
the explosion he put off in a boat to render
assistance, but could find no trace of the
tug or of any of the crew. As far as can be
learned, tne crew numbered six men, and
there seems little doubt that all perished.
ibo killed are: Lewis Uapperatta, en
gineer and half ownor of the tugboat;
t-liarles Davis, cook; Gerrett Morns, cap
tain; Gerrett Morris, jr., deck hand and
son of the captain ; Thomas Van Housen,
fireman.
OUR ARMY. .
General SchoHeld Argue That 80,000 Is a
Number None Too Large to Use.
Washington, December 8. Major-Gen-
eral Schofield, commanding the Division of
the Missouri, says in his annual report that
his force in round numbers consists of 9,500
infantry, 5,600 cavalry, and 2S0 artillery, ag
gregating 15,000 men. They occupy sixty-
five different stations, giving an average
of 231 men at each. He has the following
to say about the means necessary to pre
vent great destruction of life and property
by eavatro Indians: "lne number oi In
dians in this division, as reported by the
Interior Department, is about 170.000. Of
these about 53.000 are rated as peaceable,
the remaining 123,000 being more or jess
uncivilized and warlike. Tbeir warriors
number at least 25,000 equal to the
entire strength of the United States
army, or two-thirds more than the
whole number of troops serving in this
division. The question to be now con
sidered is whether the vast increase
of the interests of life and property involv
ed does not demand that such military
measures be adopted as will prevent in the
future any wholesale" destruction of life and
property by the uncivilized tribes of the
country. I beg leave to submit that in a
country of 50.000.000 of people. 50,000 men
would be a small army to be maintained
with some reference to possible ioreign
wars; but when the country has constant
daily use for nine-tenths of that force to
protect its people and their property against
destruction by savage tribes in their midst,
it is extremely unwise to limit the army to
its present strengtn."
A TERRIBLE MISTAKE.
Arsenic Accidentally Mixed with Coffee
and an Entire Family Poisoned.
Bellairb, Md., December 3. County
School Examiner Noble L. Mitchell, his
mother, Hannah Mitchell, and his three
brothers, Jacob, Houston and Howard,
were poisoned at their home at Mitch
ell's Mill, Hartford County, by arsenic,
which Mrs. Mitchell had accidentally out
in the breakfast coffee. Mrs. Mitchell
was attacked with vomiting soon after
breakfast. Mr. Mitchell was similarly
affected after reaching his office in this
town. His illness continued until this
evening, when he was taken home. The
other brothers also became sick in the sama
wav. The physician who was summoned
suspected poison, and an investigation ae-
veloned the fact that Mrs. Mitchell had put
arsenic in an extract box lid on the cupboard
shelf for mice, and forgetting all about the
poison, replaced tbe lid on tbe box, tnus

forcement of the laws against polygamy,
as to cause some uneasiness, but no
alarm. Tho recent shooting of a Mor

and is under command of General McCook.
In the event of trouble in Utah all the

largest fires that has visited Indianapolis
in years occurred at 2 o'clock this after

quantity of oil cake. A stiff breeze was
blowing from the west, causing the fire to
burn with rent fierceness, and for a time
there was great dnuger of the flames spread
ing to adjoining property, in which
event a great conflagration would hava
followed. By hard and skillful work on,
tbe part of the firemen, several of whom
were slightly injured, the flames were con
fined to the building in which they origi
nated. The building contained all the ma
chinery used in manufacturing linseed oil.
The building, valued at fJO.OOO, was totally
destroyed, lbe machinery, worth 45,000,
