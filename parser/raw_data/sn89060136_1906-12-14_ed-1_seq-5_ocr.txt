FRIDAY, DECEMBER 14, 1906.
France is in an uproar over the enforce
nient of the law for the separation of the
Church and State. The situation is the
outcome of the law of ‘associations cul
tuelles,” passed to regulate the relations
between the State and religious bodies.
It provides that persons may associate
themselves together for religious worship
if they comply with the requirements of
the law regarding the management of
their property. Church property is for
feited to the State for non-compliance to
the law. The law has been described as
establishing the same relations between
religious bodies and the State as exist in
this country.
According to figures compiled by R. G
Dunn Company the cost of living is on
the increase, it requiring $2 more for
living expenses during the month ending
December I, than it did the month pre
vious. The cost of commodities is the
highest since Febrnary, 1884. The mark
ed advance in prices is explained as due
to the higher cost of butter, eggs, milk,
dairy and garden products Breadstuffs
were lower on account of the decline in
wheat and corn. Meats, with the excep
tion of live beef, were fractionally lower,
and a small decline 'occurred in mess
pork, bacon, live hogs, lard and tallow.
Butter is up 3 cents a pound, eggs 7 cents
a dozen and hay 12J4 cents a hundred
pounds.
President Roosevelt and Bellamy Storer
have been occupying a great deal of
newspaper space recently over the con
troversy arising out of the dismissal of the
latter from bis post of Ambassador to
Austria-Hungary. Some interesting de
velopments will no doubt transpire before
the scandal blows over. According to Mr.
Storer, his wife’s efforts to have Arch
bishop Ireland elevated to a Cardinal
were made at President Roosevelt’s in
stigation, notwithstanding which Storer
was dismissed on account of them. The
President uses up 5,000 words in denying
the allegatiorf in a strenuous manner and
electing the dismissed Ambassador to
membership in the Ananias club.
The annual report of Secretary of the
Interior Hitchcock gives some idea of
the enormity of the land fraud scandal
with which bis Department has been
wrestling. Despite the inactivity of Con
gress and the powerful political influences
which have been exerted against the Sec
retary he has succeeded in obtaining 89
convictions in the 490 indictments for
fraud found against persons of high and
low degree. Congress is to blame for the
existence of the system which has bred
corruption in the public land department,
and persistently refuses to lend the Sec
retary any assistance in ferreting out or
bringing to justice the guilty parties. The
reason for this inaction is readily found
in the fact that numerous United States
Senators and Representatives are impli
cated in the frauds, and naturally they
decline to aid in their own conviction.
Condition Ot Our Public Roads.
The following item, relative to the con
dition of the public roads in upper Cecil
was furnished the Oxford Press by its
Calvert correspondent :
“The Commissioners of Cecil county
would do a good service for the traveling
public the coming winter by fencing up
the public road from Calvert to the Penn
sylvania State line below Chrome, Ches
ter county. A great portion of this road
is now unfit to travel on because of inat
tention by the party whose duty it is to
keep it in repair. It is full of holes and
deep muddy ruts, with many large sized
stones lying on itssurfa'ce. The ’mender,’
we are informed, has not done any work
on it this year. People traveling from
the north to Calvert should go and return
byway of the ‘White House.’ ”
The "inattention” complained of by
the Calvert correspondent is responsible
for the wretched condition of numerous
of our roads, and as the season at present
is one wherein little road work can be
done there is not much prospect for im
provement. Some weeks ago the Com
missioners were petitioned to gravel the
Barnes’ Corner road, in the hope that the '
work might be done before winter set in,
but no action, we understand, was taken.
It is hoped that if this work is ever done
the matter of preparation of the road bed ■
and drainage will be given proper atten
tion before the gravel is applied, if good j
results are expected. The dumping of
gravel in the roads without due attention
to the important items mentioned, as has
been done in numerous instances, has
proven as unsatisfactory in obtaining
■ lasting results as have the other careless
methods of road mendiug long practiced
in our county.
WASHINGTON LETTER.
It is demonstrated this early in the ses
sion that a ship subsidy bill will be pass
ed, not perhaps the general subsidy out
lined in Secretary Root’s memorable
speech at Kansas City but a subsidy con
fined strictly to ships plying between the
United States and South American ports
and the Philippines. Such a subsidy will
answer for an opening wedge and if the
experiment shall prove efficacious in
reviving the American merchant marine
it can bejextended to cover other routes.

That the situation as regards strained
relations with Japan is not serious and
that the President is satisfied that the
trouble has been at least temporarily ad
justed is evidenced by the departure of
Secretary Root for New York Thursday.
The effect of the President’s message has
been most satisfactory so far as the little
Japs are concerned and Viscount Aoki
who is Ambassador from the Flowery
Kingdom made a special call at the White
House to thank the President for his
cordial words about Japan and to assure
him in bis polished Japanese manner that
Japan entertains no less flattering regard
for the United States. In spite of official
denials from the White House and from
the Departments it is nevertheless per
sistently rumored that a new treaty had
been negotiated with Japan which pro
vided for the exclusion of Japanese coolies
from the United States. If there is no
such treaty under advisement at least
there is an agreement that will take the
place of a'formal treaty and by which the
Japanese will be restrained from sending
coolies into this country. It is well
known that the Japanese will not consider
this exclusion a hardship for they prefer
to bring about increased immigration to
Korea and Manchuria by sending the
coolies there rather than having them go
to the United States. Senator Perkins of
California has had several long interviews
with the President since the message was
delivered to Congress and since the part
relating to the California trouble caused
such a stir among Calitornia Representa
tives and Senators. As a result of these
interviews the ruffled feelings of the Cal
ifornians have been smoothed out, for
Senator Perkins has explained that the
President’s reference to. his intention to
use military force if necessary was meant
to apply only to an instance where Jap
anese protected by treaty rights were
threatened with pbysicial violence.

Secretary Bonaparte in his annual re
port to Congress advises the construction
of two great battleships as formidable as
those possessed by any power in the
world, to cost about ten millions of dollars
each. He wants these two monster ships
in addition to the big battleship author
ized at the last sessiou of Congress. He
also recommends the more rapid promo
tion of junior officers, and the establish
ment of a reserve list, composed of a large
force of seamen to be held in readiness
for emergency and to he added to the
navy at the outbreak of war. He also
believes that there should be a general
increase of salaries in the civil list in
order that the Navy department may
keep its efficient clerks instead of having
them lured away by the offers of better
salaries in other employments.

As was to be expected the dismissal of
the negro troops was promptly taken up
by Congress and before twenty-four hours
had passed Senator Penrose had intro
duced a resolution criticizing the Presi
dent’s action in the matter and was fol
lowed by Senator Foraker, who thought
that Senator Penrose bad not been severe
enough on the Chief Executive. Taking
the matter in his own hands he preferred
a resolution of a more vigorous character
and one calling for fqll official informa
tion regarding the circumstances of the
discharge. After a spirited attack on the
policy of the President iu which he said
“I deny the right of the President to dis
charge a soldier where the dismissal car
ries punishment, without trial by court
martial.” The resolution was passed by
the Senate. Senator I-'oraker declares
i that he is not seeking to raise a race
' question and that the matter is not oue of
color at all. To his mind the whole army
is involved and he asks dramatically, I
“What is the use of Congress raising an 1
■ army if the President at one stroke could I
' disband it ? ”

! The Rivers and Harbors Congress with
representatives from every part of the'
country where waterways are used or re- {
quired has been iu session iu Washington
during the week. The object of the Cou
; gress is to prevail upon Congress to vote |
an annual appropriation of not less than
#50,000,000 for the improvement of rivers
and harbors. Several hundred delegates
have attended the meeting here and
addresses have been delivered by Speaker
Caunon and other prominent men, and
Vice President Fairbanks has attended
some of the sessions. The President
received the delegates to the convention
and expressed himself to them as heartily
in favor of any movement that looked to
the betterment of conditions in the great
waterways of the country, or of the open
ing of new ones to commerce.

The startling revelations of the
Wyoming land frauds threaten to involve
at least two United States Senators, prom
inent officials of the general land office
and other well known men. Millions of
dollars are at stake and the Interstate
Commerce Commission has secured dur
ing its hearing of the cases testimony
enough to supply many great law suits,
but the most absorbing feature of the sit
uation to those whose interests are not
directly involved is with regard to Senator
Clark and Senator Warren, who are said
to be implicated in the coal land graft
which has resulted in the President rec
ommending that the coal lands be per
manently withdrawn from settlement.
Senators Clark and Warren, particularly
the latter, have been held in high regard
in Washington and the announcement
that they were involved in the land scan-,
dal has been unwillingly accepted by
many of their fellow Senators and friends
outside. When the rumor first became
public a prominent Senator threw up his
• hands and exclaimed, “Great Heavens,
what is the Senate coming to anyway.
Pretty soon it will be looked upon as a
disgrace to be in the Senate and people
will avoid speaking to a Senator on the
street for fear of being liable to the de
duction that 'birds of a feather flock
together.’ ” More optimistic people
though do not take the despairing view
of the prominent Senator. They declare
that the Senate is no worse than it
always was, and that in fact it is really
better, but that it is harder for a dishonest
man to escape or hide these days.
