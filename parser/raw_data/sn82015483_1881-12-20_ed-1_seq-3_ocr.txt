Owing to the Bereavement

Beresvreel Jitror- No Session of th
- Gaiteau Trial Yesterday Tha Assata-
sln'a 'Improved Appearance -Scovllle's
Ilealtn SnlTerlnf; From His Severe
Study.-
Wabhtnoton, Deo. 19. On account of the
death of the wife of Juror Hobbs, the case
of Ouiteau was adjourned until Wednesday by
consent of counsel on both sides, and of the
prisoner. Mr. Scoville desired the judge to
admonish fhe jury as to the impropriety of
holding commrinioationB on subjects of this
case, which was done. The usual number of
spectators were on hand this morning, but
nothing occurred to gratify their curiosity
except the entrance of the prisoner with a
clean-shaven face. Guiteau was quiet but in
good spirits after the adjournment of court.
Ee received a few visitors and wrote and read
alternately during the afternoon. Now that
the novelty is worn off he rather likes his
clean-shaven face. This is in some measure
due to complimentary allusions made as to
his improved looks. As he passed to the
prison van from the court room remarks were
loudly made about his clerical, sprightly ap
pearance : and the assassin is said - to
have enjoyed them hugely, while at the
same time he kept close to the officers
fearful lest some avenger should be in the
crowd. With his wiry beard and scrubby
mustache Ouiteau had a wild look,' but now
that these have been removed his face is
sharp and keen in expression. His lips, which
are rather thin, close sharply together and
leave more than a suspicion of a cynical
smile. Taken altogether his facev now con
veys the impression of an intelligent, shrewd
man, of an unoommordy vain, self-conceited
disposition. People who thought him crazy
when he wore his much prized hirsute ap
pendages had no hesitation in declaring to
day that his face was as brightlooking as that
of any person in the crowd. - He expresses
great sympathy for the bereaved juror and is
anxious that the case-should be hurried to a
close.
Mr. Scoville received a dispatch to-day
that his mother was better and he conse
quently feels no more anxious on the score
of being compelled to leave the defense in
other hands. He is in favor of holding ses
sions daily during the holidays. His health
is evidently suffering from the great strain of
conducting the case alone. His eyelids are
inflamed from constant study and his face is
becoming paler and sharper in expression. In
conversation concerning Guiteau to-day Mr.
Scoville said : "He does not seem to be .Able
to look ahead and see what is going to come
from the - questions I ask witnesses. Al
most always when I lay the foundation for
contradicting a witness he does positive inju
ry to his case and spoils the whole thing by
correcting the witness right there and putting
him on his guard. The other day I had some
information about Witness Shaw which led
me to have him summoned again as a wit
ness. Guiteau told it all in court and so put
Shaw on his guard and he knows just what I
intend to ask him about." Shaw of New
York, the witness who testified to hearing
Guiteau say he intended to imitate Wilkes
Booth, appeared in court this morning in
answer to a summons from Mr. Scoville.
Mr. Scoville says he can prove that Shaw
was indicted for perjury in New Jersey. In
reference to ' Mrs. Dunmire he says he can
prove that she said at the time of her divorce
to Dr. Bowker, of New York, that she
thought she ought to remain with Guiteau as
she believed he was insane and needed some
one to care for him. Witnesses upon these
points will be placed on the stand when the
government finishes its rebuttal testimony.
Tlie Protection of the President.
Washington, Dec. 19. Following is the
text of the bill for the protection of the per
son of the President of the United States
presented in the House to-day by Mr. Hawk,
of Illinois :
Be It enacted, etc.. That any attack with a" deadly
weapon upon the person of the President of the
United States and the infliction of wounds upon his
body shall be held and deemed to be an act of treason
against the United States, and upon trial and convlo
tion of the person so offending the crime shall be
punishable by death.
Section 2. That any attack upon the person of the
President of the United States, with the intent to
commit bodily injury, shall be held to be and deemed
a misdemeanor and the party so offending shall upon
trial and conviction be fined not less than nor
more than and be imprisoned for a period of
not lees than nor more than .
- Section 3. If the party making an assault upon the
person Of the President of the United States shall on
trial be found irresponsible for his act by reason of
his mental condition or other cause, he shall not be
liable to the penalties enumerated in sections one and
two of this act, but such person so offending shall be
Imprisoned during his natural life or until such time
as his complete restoration to a condition of account
ability. -
Mr. Hawk said to-night that he presented
the bin at the suggestion of his constituents.
Be is fully aware of some of the difficulties
in the way of preparing a measure of this
kind, but hopes that discussion that may
grow out of the presentation of this bill may
result in useful legislation in this direction.
FORTY-SEVENTH CONGRESS.
Washington, Dec. 19.
Rvwatr After the mornlnjt hour the subject of
the Presidential succession came up, and Mr. Jones,
of Florida, resumed his argument. Senator Jones
continued his remarks at considerable length, mainly
in support of his argument that It was the intent of
the f ramers of the Constitution to give the same
force to inability as to death, resignation or removal,
and that there was no such thing as temporary ina
bility. He contended that if the Vice President en
tered upon the discharge of the Presidential office
the subsequent removal of Inability would not re
store the preceding incumbent.
At tne conclusion ox jar. oaw ajieevii, un
i.M before the Senate a communication from the
President transmitting a letter from Blaine dated
December 19th, relating to consular jurisaiotion in
China and Japan, which was an elaboration of the
ideas in the President', message on the same subject.

. NEW YORK.
Battered to Death A Despondent Hus
band's Horrible Hatchery- Murder
Followed by Suicide.
"New York, Dee. 19. One of the most hor
rible crimes of butchery and bloodshed on
record took place this morning in Forty
eighth street. . A Bohemian carpenter bat
tered his wife's brains out with a larg car
penter's mallet and then out his own throat
with a razor, slashed his face and body and
afterward hung himself.: 'About 10 o'clock
this morning a young German woman accom
panied by another woman entered the police
station and asked that the sick wagon be sent
to 330 East Fortv.eichth atreet to take her
"husband to the hospital.- "We have no food
nor money or means ox any inna to procure
a doctor," said the woman in tearful voice,
"and we are starving for want of something
to eat." She further stated that her hus
band, Wenzer Felix, a carpenter, two months
ago while at work on a new building had
fallen to the street and was severely injured.
He was removed to the' hospital, where he
remained for a couple of days until he was
enabled to return to his home. "'Since that
time he has been ill and unable to work, and
of course we have had no means of support."
Half an hour later a wagon was sent and the
driver knocked at the door. There was no
response.. He knocked louder and louder,
but received no answer, so turning away he
accosted Policeman Davis. The latter, plac
ing his shoulder to the door, forced it open
Such a sight as that which, presented itseL
never was seen or dreamed of. Lying across
the miserable apartment was the form of a
woman covered with- blood. "The . head was
one mass of dotted gore, and her brains
were scattered about on the floor. Beside
her lay the weapon that dealt her the death
blow, a large, heavy wooden mallet weighing
probably fifteen pounds, covered with blood
and parts of her flesh. The husband,
a youthful looking man with pale
and ghastly face, was dangling - from
the stove, pipe, suspended by a clothes line
with his feet just touching the floor. His
throat was out from- ear to' ear and blood
covered his. clothing and dripped from his
feet to the floor. Close by the hanging man
en a small table rested a small razor, bloody
and evidently the weapon used in cutting the
throat of the man. Everything in the apart
ment was strewn about, showing that a des
perate struggle had taken place and that the
woman had not died until many blows had
been struck. There were no witnesses to
the terrible deed. The precaution of closing
the window shutters even had been taken by
the murderer. The bodies were almost cold
when the policeman felt to ascertain if a
spark of life yet remained. The husband
was out down and laid beside his victim.
The building was occupied by several fami
lies, the general floor being used as
a grocery apartment. It is scarcely
eight feet by seven in size with a low
ceiling and poor, ventilation. In this small
den the couple had lived for the past six
months. The furniture oonsisted of a bro
ken, dilapidated bedstead, scanty and ragged
bedclothes, a couple of broken chairs, a few
ornaments, a trunk and several pieces of
crockery. A loaf of bread half eaten lying
on the table completed the contents of the
room. . Everything betokened the most ab
ject poverty. Just prior to the removal of
the corpses to the morgue, a hooded woman,
with a shawl almost concealing her features,
passed up the alley and walked to the door of
the room where the dead lay. It was the
murderer's sister. The sister stated that the
dead couple had been in this country but six
months, being natives of Taos in Bohemia.
They had been married nine months. They
came here with another brother and sister.
They did not live happily together after
their arrival in this, country, and for some
time lately they quarreled and fought regu
larly. -Poverty seemed to be the cause of
their troubles, and frequently there was not a
morsel of food in the house.

A Miner's Reckle.it Act.
Mt. Union, Dec. 19. Early this morning
John A. Ingram, a miner, placed a package
of dynamite on the cook stove at his home
to dry it out. He had barely turned, when
it exploded with terrific force. The build
ing was blown to atoms and the shock to the
townspeople was like that of an earthquake.
Ingram, his wife and four children were in
stantly killed. But one child escaped.
Nothing remains of the house and hardly
enough of the family over which to hold an
inquest. The little one who escaped is being
properly cared for. - '

of 17 to 15.
The report of the committee de gates at
Argyle and Division streets reported that the
crossings had not been accepted and as the
stre-.t was to be lowered action should be de
ferred; passed.
Report of the clerk of the City Court for
the month of .November was read and or
dered on file.
Report of the Board of Publio Works
showing the cost of sewers and pavements in
various streets was read and referred to the
board of compensation for the assessment of
sewers and pavements.
Several adverse reports of the Committee
on Claims (published last week) were read
and petitioners were given leave to with
draw. Resolution relating to the tie vote for AI -
derman in the Eleventh ward, and recom
mending that as considerable doubt existed
in regard to the legality of the election and
the right of the Court of Common Council to
call for a new election, that the matter be re
ferred to the next Court of Common Council.
Councilman Benton denounced the resolu
tion as a piece of demagogism. He said the
Corporation Counsel had decided that an
election could be called for the 30th of the
present month and His Honor the Mayor had
said he would call the election at that time if
so ordered. He said it was simply a scheme
to prevent tne Alderman in the iUeventh
ward from having a voice in the seleotion of
commissioners next year.
Councilman Barker replied, and said that
he scorned any insinuation that he or his
colleagues would deprive the Alderman in
the Eleventh ward from participating in the
selection of commissioners. lie had no
sympathy in any such movement, and would
scorn to participate in it. He said if there
was any doubt about the legality of this reso
lution the fault must be laid to the door of
Republican legislators. He said he was not
here to stir up strife in the Board whose
term of office was now drawing to a close.
Councilman cuahing thought the charter
was plain in regard to calling an election in
case of a tie.
Councilman Wilson said that the Board
should strive to be honest to others while
striving to be honest themselves in the dis
charge of their duty.
Councilman Twiss said he was taken by
surprise at the action of his Democratic col
leagues this evening, as he had no doubt
about the passage of the resolution as pre
sented by the Board of Aldermen. He said
that in the resolution under discussion there
was grave doubts. He read from the charter
to show that the Common Counoil had the
power to call elections and fix the time for
holding the same. Mr. Twiss called upon
Mr. Barker to tell him howan election could
be tided over until the next Court of Common
Council under the present charter and said if
he could not do this, then he must say that
it was not the gentleman's honest conviction,
but that he had been influenced by others in
the course he had. taken. He believed that
unless an election was held during the pres
ent year, it could not be held until a year
from the last election.
Councilman Barker replied and said that
his opinion was that if at the opening of the
new Court of Common Counoil the clerk an
nounced that there was a vacancy in the
Eleventh ward a new election could be held.
If it could be shown that the Eleventh ward
would be deprived of representation then
that would change tne pnase oi tne wnoie
matter, but he did not understand this to be
the case.
Councilman Benton said the gentleman
from the Fifth (Barker) admitted that the
citizens of the Eleventh ward would be de
prived of their vote for commission era and
he moved to indefinitely postpone the resolu
tion. The motion tf Councilman Benton was
lost by a party vote of 17 to 15.
Councilman Lawton said he had no doubt
but that an election could be called to take
place fifteen days after the incoming of the
new Board of Aldermen.
Councilman Benton asked the Democratic
members of the Board to get up and say that
the purpose of this vote was to deprive the
voters of the Eleventh ward from representa
tion in the seleotion of commissioners. He
desired that they should be put upon record
on this question. That was alL
Councilman Twiss moved that the resolu
tion be amended so as to make the election
occur on the 80th of" Deosmber, in accord
ance with the vote of the Board of Alder
men. He advocated his motion in an able
speech. He afterward withdrew his amend
ment. ' --"' " ' " ; " -;
" Councilman Benton raised the point of or
der that the resolution referring the election in
the Eleventh ward to the next Court of Com
mon Council was new business and therefore
could not be acted upon except by unani
mous consent. ',".' . ,
" The chair, after consideration, decided the
point well taken.
A motion to take the resolution from the
table ordering a new election in the Eleventh
ward was then made. " C::
The motion was lost -by a party vote of 17

The estimates for 1882 were then taken up.
Those for the police, fire and health depart

Board of Aldermen were adopted. '
