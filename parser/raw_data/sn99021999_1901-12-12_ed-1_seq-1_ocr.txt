APPROVE PHILIPPINE TARIFF

WASHINGTON. Dec. It. At a mooting ot
tho wayn and means committee today Chair
man Payne was directed to report favorably
to the house tho Philippine tariff bill, which
he republican members of the committed
. wl upon yesterday. Tho report will
' do Friday and tho hilt will ho con-
' 'n the house naxt Tuesday, with a
vote . m. on Wednesday, Instead of
on TIil ns nt first planned.
Somo h was occasioned at tho fail
ure of the ,tiorlty of tho committee to
nsk for a division nnd vote on the ques
tion of reporting tho bill. In the absence of
such request no voto was recorded. It was
tatrd, however, that a minority report
ould bo presented by tho democratic mem-
hers auposlng tho hill on general grounds,
Ithough It is doubtful whether Represents-
tlvo Robertson of Louisiana will sign the
report.
Surprint from Democrat.
Numerous conferences of democratic mem-
crs were held prior to tho meeting ot the
ays aril means committee becnuso of tho
question which had nrlsen ns to united
opposition to the Philippine hill drafted
by republican members. It developed that
tho tour Ixjulslana members now Iti tbo
Ity, UepresontntlvcB Robertson, Meyer,
Davis and Ransdcll, were favornblo to tho
bill, and that tho two Louisiana members
out of the city, Messrs. Droussard and
reazeale, probably would favor It.
Tho Louisiana members mado no conceal
ment of tho fact that the sugar Industry
f their statu required the measuro of pro-
ectlon against 1'hlllpplno sugar, which tho
majority bill gave by applying the Dlngluy
rates. Under thesn circumstances tho mi
nority members reached no united decision
b to oppuslng tho bill nnd, although there
111 bo u minority report opposing tho in ea fi
re on general grounds, tho Ixnilalana
members will hold themselves Individually
freo to voto for tho bill.
Secrotnry Oago has written to Chairman
'nyne, pointing out that the bill should
provide for a robato when articles exported
from this country contain Ingredients Im
ported from tho Philippines on which duty
lrcndy has been paid. Tho bill probably
will be amended to conform to this sug
gestion. NOMINATIONS SENT TO SENATE

OliJcctN to Star ('hiiiiihcrx,
Thero was strong opposition to tbo send

differences existing between the unions
nutBldo of the executlvo council, but the
majority of tho delegates voted otherwise.
The reading ot tho report of tho executive

the Associated Press;
Tho Pennsylvania Railroad company Is
now prepared to carry out Its policy long
since ndopted ot extending Its railroad Into
New York Cltv. therein establishing n suit
able passcimor terminus for the nccommo
datlon of the public.
Tn ticeumpllsli this on n comprehensive
plan the Long Island Extension Knllro.nl
company will withdraw Its application for
power to construct Ita terminal railroad
and In lieu of such Independent construc
tion It Is now proposed to build, under the
charter of tho Pennsylvanlu-New York Ex
tension Railroad company. Just organized,
nnd a New Jersey rullrnnd company about
tn bo organized, n through underground
connection hetween the lxng Island rail
road nnd the Pennsylvania lines In New
Jersey and to construct n proper nnd com
modious Joint underground terminal sta
tion In New York City for tho Pennsylvania
nnd Iong Island roads.
After yenni of exhaustive study the con
clusion has been reached that n tunnel
line, operated by electricity. Is In every
way the most practicable, economical uml
tho best, both for the Interests of tho rail
road company and nt the public. Tho lino
ns adopted will traverse New York City
from tho Hudson river to tho East river
mid bo underground throughout, nnd nt
such depth as not to Interfere with future
construction of subways by tho city on
nil Its avenues, similar to tho olio now
building alons Fourth avenue.
As the railroad will bo wholly under

Mime manner as tho recently constructed
Orleans railway extension in Paris, it will
not he objectlonnblc In any way.

tween life and death today. She, showed
somo Improvement this morning, but tin
chalice for recovery Is very slight. "It's
n woman," "It's In a book" nnd "I'll tell
you all about It" nre tho only coherent
words that tho detective sitting by her
sldo hns been nblo to distinguish. Theso
were spoken when she apparently realized
what she said. Tbo detectives aro not
yet ready to announco a motive for tho
crime. William II. Johns of Gettysburg,
Pa., a nephew of tho victim, arrived today
and after being ndmltted to tho sick room
went to pollco headquarters, leaving thero
subsequently with ft detective. Tho hos
pital attendants nro keeping tho patient
very quiet nnd hopo she may be nblo to

A small old-fashioned hatchet which
probably has been used hr tho faintly for
niHtiy years was found by tletectlvcs today
In a closet In the room ot tho older Mrs
Dennis, mothor-ln-lnw of the Injured
woman. This room Is In tbo rear part of
the second floor. There were Indications
of rust and other stains In both the hnndlo

analyzed. Tho result of tho chemical an
nlyels ot tho hatchet failed to disclose tha
presence of blood stains.
Lato tonight thero had been no develop

mystery which surrounds the assault of tho
unfortunate woman. Tho victim's condi

that If she lives forty-eight hours thero
may be somo hopo for her. She Is can

'COMMUNITY OF INTERESTS" AT STAKE
Thrent of Hate CiHMiik ARnlnit the
l'nuter Lines tlrliiK Them t
Terms, hut President liny Yet
Veto the Trenty.
CHICAGO, Dec. 11. (Special Telegram.)
Tho spirit which presides over tho destiny
of tho "community of Interests" succeeded
today In putting an effectual stop to fast
chcdules between Chicago and tho western
and northwestern gateways. -
At a meeting of tho executlvo olllclnls of
tho lines running between Chicago nnd
Omnha, Chicago nnd Knnsas City nnd Chi
cago and St. Paul n resolution was passed
limiting tho speed which can be made be
tween here nnd Omaha nnd between hero
nntl St. Paul. Tho Omaha limit Is thirteen
hours nnd thirty minutes and the St. Paul
limit twclvo hours and flfty-llvo minutes.
Thnt a limit wns not placed upon Kansas
City and Denver Is duo to the fact that tho
schedules that will exist when tho resolu
tion Is carried Into effect bear no menace
o tho business of tho weak lines botweeu
the places named.
It was further agreed In tho resolution
that tho Omaha schedule should bo rear
ranged to fit tho agreement not later than
December 31 and that tho St. Paut situa
tion should bo ndjusted by December 22.
Take Oft Knst Mcepers.
Tho effect of this resolution on St. Paul
nnd Minneapolis will bo to tako off tho
sleepers which aro now running In contiec-
Ion with tho fast mall trains on the North
western and the St. Paul roads, iiiesc
trains make the run In ten hours. The
old-tlmo agreement between tho two cities
cnllcd for n minimum schedule of thirteen
hours and twenty minutes, so that tho new
schedule as ndopted Is twenty-live minutes
fnster than that, but Is two hours ond
flfty-llvo minutes slower than tho prenont
fastest schedule.
In order to carry out tho agreement be
tween here nnd Omaha tho Northwestern
will havo to lengthen tho schedule of tho
Overland Limited fifty minutes, which will
probably ngaln leave Chicago nt 6:30 p. m
Instead of at 8 p. m., ns at present, in
addition, tho Northwestern will havo to
lengthen by twenty mluutcs tho time made
by train No. C, which now leaves Chicago
nt 10 u. m. and arrives at omaua at li.iu
m.
Tho Rock Islnnd will lengthen tho sched
ule of Its "Omnha Limited" and the Hur
llngton will lengthen Its schedule by fifteen
minutes.
In Spite of Improvement.
Tho settlement of tho question apparently
Illustrates the power of tho "community
of interests." Desplto the fact that over
$20,900,000 has been expended by tho Union
Pacific and tho Northwestern In better
ments between hero and Omaha and Ogdcn,
nnd desplto tho fact that tho Southern Pa
ciflo I- expending another $25,000,000 no
tween Ogdcn and San Francisco, vmn a
view to shortening tho tlmo fifteen hours
botween Chicago and tho Pacific coast, the
officials of these companies readily laid
down tho advantage which tho expenditure
of thnt vast sum of money gives them. It

agement will attempt to keep tho tlmo of
tho "Overland Limited" the snmo.ns It la
at present with respect to Chicago and tho

Although everything wns nmlcnhlo in tho
dlscusslun it wns understood nt tho outset
that tho weak lines botween Chicago and
St. Paul would cut rates provided an ad
justment was not reached which should
protect what they deem their fair share
of tho btiElness. This threat had Its ef
fect. .May lie n Hitch.
Whllo nil the roads represented at the
meeting voted. or. tho new agreement, It
Is not certain' thnt it will bo carried nut.

to bo ratified by their presidents.
It Is understood that tho president of
ono of tho roads objects to tho agreement
nnd tho prospect Is that ho may repudlato
It. Ho takes tho position that tho prin

Is wrong and against public Interests.
