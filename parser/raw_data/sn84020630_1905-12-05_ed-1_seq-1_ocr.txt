Washington, Dec. 5. Delegate W.
H. Andrews had a long consultation
today with Chairman Hamilton of the

joint statehood bill which will be sub
stantially like the one which passed
the House a year ago and which will
contain some amendments, which, it
is thought, will make it more satis
factory to the people of the two terri
tories.
Republican leaders in the Senate
and House predict that the omnibus
bill a year ago, with some amend
ments and creating Oklahoma and In
dian Territory as one state and Now
Mexico as one state will be passed.

Russians Attempt to Save Life of Con
demned Strike Leader at
Samara.
Warsaw, Dec. 5. The executive
committee of the Railroad Employes
Union has telegraphed to all the sta
tions of the Russian railroads urging
the men to begin a general strike at
midnight unless the sentence of death
passed by a court martial at Samara
on Sokoloff the engineer, and on other
local leaders of the recent railroad
strike at Samara, are revoked before
that hour.
Poland Free of Soldiers.
Warsaw, Dec. 5. An abolition of
the minor state of martial law was
gazetted today and Poland Is now
completely free from military rule.
The authorities have prohibited the
proposed meeting of striking post and
telegraph employes. Advices from

dered the mutineers to bo tried by
court martial in accordance with the
procedure in war time.
Information from Moscow says
committee ot the Bourse is trying to
arrange a settlement of the telegraph
strike.
ROOF FALLS IN
Accident at One of London's Railway
Stations Causes Loss of
Life.
London, Dec. 5. The south end of
an immense roof, spanning the Char
ing Cross main line station here, sud
denly collapsed this afternoon and
completely blocked traffic.
A number of workmen and trains
were caught in the wreck. The great
girders snapped with a tremendous
report and huge pieces of iron, roof
and timbers fell on the trains beneath,
carrying down with them men who
were working on the roof.
The roof of the avenue theater ad
joining the station .also collapsed. A
large number of workmen were taken
to the adjoining hospitals but appar
ently no passengers were on the
trains-
Some of the cars were smashed to
kindling wood. About thirty injured
persons have already been taken to
the hospitals. One of them died im
mediately and others are in a critical
condition. There are a number of
dead in the ruins.
BIG POSTAL INCREASE.
The Rush Season Has Already Begun
and Shows Increase Over Last
Year.
The receipts for postage of the local
postoffice for last month were $1,241.60
an increase of 25 per cent, over the
receipts for October and of 33 per
cent over September.
An idea of the increase in business
on account of the holiday season may
be gained from the fact that yester
day fifty-three money orders were is
sued against fifteen on the same day
last month. On last Saturday fifty
were issued against twenty-two on the
same day last month; while on Fri
day forty were issued and on last
Thursday forty-one against twenty
and twenty-three on the same days last
month. This same ratio of increase is
also apparent in the number of orders
paid and the number of 'registered let
ters and packages handled.
This increase monthly is also a
material increase over the correspond
ing months of last year.
The holiday rush has begun all over
the United States and the mail clerks
on the mail .trains are having a busy
time of it, in fact, are already falling
behind, for mail that ordinarily takes
three days from New York to New
Mexico points now takes four, five and
even six days. The public should
bear this In mind when sending out
mail with the idea that it will reach
Us destination on a certain day.

Text of Message.
The message in part follows-
To the Senate and House of Repre
sentatives:
The people of this country continue
to enjoy great prosperity. Undoubt
edly there will be ebb and flow in
such prosperity, and this ebb and flow
will be felt more or less by all mem
bers of 'the community, both by the
deserving and the undeserving.
Against the wrath of the Lord, the
wisdom of man cannot avai; in times
of flood or drought, human ingenuity
can but partially repair the disaster.
A general failure of crops would hurt
all of us. Again, if the folly of man
mars the general well-being, then
those who are innocent of the folly
will have to pay part 'of the penalty
Incurred by those who are guilty of
the folly. A 'panic brought on by the
speculative folly of part of the busi
ness community would hurt the whole
business community. But' such stop
page of welfare, though it might " be
severe, would not be lasting. In the
long run, the one vital factor in the
permanent prospertly of the country
is the nigh individual character of the
average American worker, the aver
age American citizen no matter
whether his work be mental or man
ual, whether he be farmer or wage
worker, business man or professional
man. ' '
Yet while not merely ..admitting
but Insisting upon this, it is also true
that where there is no governmental
restraint or supervision some of the
exceptional men usei their energies in
ways that are for the common good,
but in ways which tell against this
common good.
Hold Corporations.
In order to insure a healthy social
and Industrial life, every big corpora
tion should be held responsible by,
and be accountable to, some sover
eign, strong enough, to control Its con
ducts I am In no sense hostile to cor
porations. This Is an age of combina
tion, and any effort to prevent all
combinations will be not only useless,
but in the end vicious, because of the
contempt for law which the (allure to

Each can and has done great crood.
Each should be favored so long as it
But each should be sharp
vhere it acts against law
rs or our National Consti
'led especially that thf
of Interstate commerce
... a. u. within the sphere of the
general government I believe that
this regulation and supervision can be
obtained by the enactment of law by
the Congress. If this proves Impossi
ble, it will certainly be necessary ulti
mately to confer In fuller form such
power upon the National Government
by a proper amendment to the Con
stitution.' .
Laws Negative.
It has been a misfortune that the
national laws on this subject have
i hitherto been of a negative or prohib
itive rather than an affirmative kind,
and still more that they have in part
sought to prohibit what could not be
effectively prohibited, and have in
part in their prohibitions confounded
what should be allowed and what
should not be allowed. The Depart
ment of Justice has for the last four
years devoted more attention to the
enforcement of the anti-trust legisla
tion than to anything else. The suc
cessful prosecution of one device to
evade the law Immediately develops
another device to accomplish the
same purpose. What is needed is not
sweeping prohibition of every arrange
ment, good or had, which may tend to
restrict competition, but such adequate-
supervision and regulation as
will prevent any restriction of compe
tition being to the detriment of the
public as well as such supervision
and regulation as will prevent other
abuses in no way connected with re
striction of competition. Of these
abuses, perhaps the chief, although
by no means the only one, is over
capitalization generally itself the re
sult of dishonest promotion because
of the myriad evils it brings in its
train. .. ...
.Until the National Government ob
tains, In some manner which the wis
dom of the Congress may suggest,
proper control over the big corpora
tions engaged in interstate commerce
that is, over the great majority of
the big corporations It will be Im
possible to deal adequately with these
evils.
Railroad Regulation.
The first thing to do is to deal with
the great corporations engaged in the
business of interstate transportation.
As I said in my message of December
6th last, the immediate and most press
ing need, so far as legislation is con
cerned, Is the enactment Into law of
some scheme to secure to the agents
and regulation of the rates charged by
the railroads of the country engaged
in j interstate traffic as shall summari
lv and effectively prevent the Impost

NEW BANK FOR CITY?
Rumor Has It That Capitalists Will
Invest Funds Here in Near
Future.
It is rumored in Santa Fe today, that
a new bank is to be started in this
city in the near future. A building
now in the course of construction,
rumor alleges, is to be the home of
the new institution. It is also further
rumored that the bank is to be start
ed by a strong combination of eastern
capital capable of handling such a
proposition and that several well
known citizens are also Interested. It
is known that banking men have been
in Santa Fe from the east during the
past six weeks looking over the field.
They reported favorably upon the
proposition. Although the bank is
not as yet assured, It sill probably be
started. The New Mexican has been
promised tho inside of the affair and
at the proper time will print the facts.
Should such a bank be located here
it would form a connecting chain be
tween Santa Fe and several well
known and well established banking
concerns in the east.
U. S. MARSHAL'S OFFICE.
Who Will Get this Soft Snap Next
Year Is Question that
Puzzles.
The office of United States Mar.
shal for New Mexico is one of the
neatest and nicest in the gift of the
President. There la not much to do,
there are plenty of deputies to do it
and the salary amounts to the goodly
sum of $5,000 per year. Creighton M.
Foraker has enjoyed this plum for
eight years. He is a candidate for
re-appointment, and it is understood
he is endorsed by citizens from vari
ous sections of the Territory.
There are, however, other candi
dates, and there is, therefore, a fight
for the position. The New Mexican is
informed from Albuquerque that Cap
tain W. E. Dame, Clerk of the Sec
ond Judicial District Court, went to
Washington to help Mr. Foraker for
re-appolntment.
Among the other candidates, ac
cording to report, is A. G. Dawson, a
well known cltizeu of Raton, who is
In the cattle business In Colfax Coun
ty. Mr. Dawson has been a resident
of the Territory since boyhood, and is
today in the prime of lite. He is a
strong Republican, a man of clean re.
cord and good habits, and has all. the
necessary qualifications for a good of
ficial. He has local indorsements, as
well as the recommendations of sever
al members of the "Rough Riders."
It is also said that Samuel H. Elk-
ins, postmaster at Columbia, Missouri,
for the past four years, and a brother
of United States Senator Stephen ' B.
Elkins, ts also a candidate for the po
sition. Mr. Elkins was a candidate
eight years ago, when President Mc-
Kinley was inaugurated, but the For
aker influence was too strong, ana
Creighton M. Foraker secured the
plum.
Mr. Elkins is engaged in mining In
the southern part of this county, on
the Ortiz Mine Grant having hacl a
lease on what is known as the "Cun
ningham mine" for a long term oi
years, and he and his associates are
working the mining property at tnis
time. It Is presumed that a nomina
tion for the position will be sent by
the President to the Senate snoruy
after the assembling of Congress
next week. The name of the man who
has been seleoted is as yet not known,
The latest information concerning
the aDnointment of U. S. marshal for
New Mexico is to he effect that the
present marshal, Creighton M. For
aker stands a very good chance to
succeed himself. He has been en
dorsed by Governor Otero, Chairman
Bursum, National Committeeman Luna
and other Republican leaders.
JUST TO SAVE TIME.
Santa Fe System to Spend $10,000,000
on the Belen Cut-Off Work Being
Pushed.
H V.. Morris, a bridge contractor,
who is interested In the building of
the big bridge at the Belen cut-off. is
in Santa Fe for a short visit.
In sDeaking of the new work being
done by the Santa Fe at the Belen
cut-off Mr. Morris said:
"Ten million dollars is a mighty big
sum. but that is what the Santa Fe
people are going to spend for the
single purpose of saving a few hours
in the running time of their trains be
tween California and the east.
"Besides the railroad and bed con
struction the company is erecting at
the cut off an enormous bridge, with
the construction of which I am con
nected. As soon as this and the cut
off have been completed the Santa Fe
will divert its trains through this cut
off and will save from 7 to 10 hours
In the time consumed between San
Francisco and Chicago."
Mr: Morris also spoke of the new
town of Belen, which he says will de
veloD into a big city some day when
the Santa Fe gets its yards completed
in that town, and as soon as the ex
tension from Belen to Rio Puerco Is
completed.

Company.
SETTLING RAPIDLY.
Roosevelt County Attractive to Many
New Settlers Fifty Miles of Cut
off Built.
Roosevelt Countv Is evidently Cu3 -.
of the most rapidly growing sections
of the Sunshine Territory and more
facts come daily to hand to prove thla.
Portions of that county, which five
years ago, supported nothing but a
steer, a few jack rabbits, a pralrla dog
or two, and two or three mottled rat
tle snakes, are now dotted with home
steads and the homesteaders, who are
living there with their families and
whose numbers are constantly on the
Increase, are raising good crops of ce
reals and vegetables and are redeem
ing these deserts from its arid condi
tion, more and more satisfactorily
daily. ..
The Bureau of Immigration of the
Territory has done much in bringing
immigrants to Roosevelt County and
In calling attention to the fact that-
with good intelligent farming and
timely work, the vast plains there
can be made productive and will fur
nish comfortable homes and a living to
many settlers.
A letter just received from one of
the new settlers in that section by the
Bureau of Immigration, explains the
situation.

The Brownhorn country is develotv
