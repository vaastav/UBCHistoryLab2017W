Washington, Dec. 3. The annual
message of President Koosevelt to
congress was read In both houses to
day. It is as follows:
To the Senate and House of Repre
sentatives:
No nation has greater resources
than ours, and I think it can be truth
fully said that the citizens of no na
tion possess greater energy and indus
trial ability. In no nation are the
fundamental business conditions
sounder than in ours at this very mo
ment; and it is foolish, when such is
the case, for people to hoard money
instead of keeping it in souna diiiks;
for it is such hoarding that Is the im
mediate occasion of money stringency.
Moreover, as a rule, the business of
our people is conducted with honesty
and probity, and this applies alike to
farms and factories, to railroads and
banks, to all our legitimate commer
cial enterprises.
In any large body of men, however,
there are certain to be some who are
dishonest, and if the conditions are
such that these men prosper or com
mit their misdeeds with impunity,
their example is a very evil thing for
the community. Where these men
are business men of great sagacity and
of temperament both unscrupulous
and reckless, and where the conditions
are such that they act without super
vision or control and at first with
out effective check from public
opinion, they delude many Innocent
people into making Investments or
embarking iri kinds of business that'
are really unsound. When the mis
deeds of these auceessiuuy oisnonesi
men are discovered, suffering comes
not only upon them, but upon the in
nocent men whom they have misled. It
is a painful awakening. Tvhenever it
occurs; and, naturally, when it does
occur those who suffer are apt to
forget that the longer it was deferred
the more painful it would be. In the
effort to punish the guilty it is both
wise and proper to endeavor so far as
possible to minimize the distress of
those who have been misled by the
gulltv. Yet it is not possible to refrain
because of such distress from striving
to put an end to the misdeeds that are
the ultimate causes of the suffering,
and. as a means to this end. where
possible to punish those responsible
for them. iiiere may ne nuncsi uii
ferencen of opinion as to many gov
ernmental policies: but surely there
can be no such differences as to the
need of unflinching perseverance In
the war against successful dishonesty.
Quotes Former Message.
In my message to the congress on
December 5, 1906, I said:
"If the folly of man mars the gen
eral well-being, then those who are in
nocent of the folly will have to pay
part of the penalty incurred by those
who are guilty of the folly. A panic
brought on by the speculative folly of
part of the business community would
hurt the whole business community;
but such stoppage of welfare, though
it might be severe, would not be last
ing. In the long run, the one vital
factor in the permanent prosperity of
the country is the high individual
character of the average American
worker, the average American citizen,
no matter whether his work be mental
or manual, whether he be farmer or
wage-worker, business man or pro
fessional man.
"In our industrial and social sys
tem the interests or an men are so
closely intertwined that in the im
mense majority of cases a straight
dealing man. who by his efficiency,
by his integrity and indus
try, benefits himself, must also benefit
others. Normally, the man of great
productive capacity who becomes
rich by guiding the labor of many
other men does so by enabling them
to .produce more than they could
produce without his guidance; and
both he and they share in the benefit,
which comes also to the public at
large. The superficial fact that the
sharing may be unequal must never
blind us to the underlying fact that
there is this sharing, and that the
benefit comes in some degree to each
man concerned. Normally, the wage
worker, the man of small means, and
the average consumer, as well as the
average producer, are all alike helped
by making conditions such that the
man of exceptional business ability re
ceives an exceptional reward for his
ability. Something can be done by
legislation to help the general pros
perity; but no such help of a per
manently beneficial character can be
given to the less able and less fortu
nate save as the results of a policy
which shall insure to the advantage of
all industrious and efficient people
who act decently: and this is only
another way of saying that any bene
fit which comes to the less able and
less fortunate must of necessity come
even more to the more able and more
fortunate. If. therefore, the less for
tunate man is moved by envy of his
more fortunate brother to strike at
the conditions under which they have
both, though unequally, prospered,
the result will assuredly be that while
damage may come to the one struck
at. It will visit with an even heavier
load the one who strikes the blow.
Taken as a whole, we must all go up
r go down together. j
ROOSEVELT'S ANNUAL MESSAGE

' ' cSSoiMTW.O.C.
President Theodore
"Yet. while not merely admitting,
but insisting upon this, it is also true
that where there is no governmental
restraint or supervision some, of the
cAucpiiuiiai men use uieir energies.
not in ways that are for the common
good, but in ways which tell against
this common good. The fortunes
amassed through corporate organiza
tion are now so large, and vest sucji
power in those that wield them, as to
make it a matter of necessity to give
to the sovereign that is, to the
government, which represents the
people as a whole some effective
power of supervision over their cor
porate use. In order to insure a
healthy social and industrial life,
every big corporation should be held
responsible by, and be accountable to,
some sovereign strong enough to con
trol its conduct. I am in no sense
hostile to corporations. This Is an
age of combination, and any effort to
prevent all combination will be not
only useless, but in the end vicious,
because of the contempt for law
which the failure to enforce law in
evitably produces. We should, more
over, recognize in cordial and ample
fashion the immense good effected by
corporate agencies In a country such
as ours, and the wealth of intellect,
energy, and fidelity devoted to their
service, and therefore normally to the
service of the public, by their officers
and directors. The corporation has
come to stay, just as the trade union
has come to stay. Each can do and
has done great good. Each should be
favored so long as it does good. But
each should be sharply checked when
it acts against law and justice.
The makers of our na
tional constitution provided especially
that the regulation of interstate com
merce should come within the sphere
of the general government. The argu
ments in favor of their taking this
stand were even then overwhelming.
But they are far stronger today, in
view of the enormous development
of great business agencies, usually
corporate in form. Experience has
shown conclusively that it is useless
to try to get any adequate regulation
and supervision of these great cor
porations by state action. Such regu
lation and supervision can only be
effectively exercised by a sovereign
whose jurisdiction is coextensive with
the field of work of the corporations
that is. by the national government.
I believe that this regulation and
supervision can be obtained by the en
actment of law by the congress.
Our steady aim should be
by legislation, cautiously and carefully
undertaken, but resolutely persevered
in, to assert the sovereignty of the na
tional government by affirmative ac
tion. "This is only in form an innovation.
In substance it is merely a restoration;
for from the earliest time such regu
lation of industrial activities has been
recognized in the action of the law
making bodies; and all that I propose
is to meet the changed conditions in
such manner as will prevent the com
monwealth abdicating the power it
has always possessed, not only in this
country, but also In England before
and since this country became a
separate nation. , .
"It has been a misfortune that the

national laws on this subject have
hitherto been of a negative or prohibi
tive rather than an affirmative kind,
and still more that they have in part
sought to prohibit' what could not be
effectively prohibited, and . have in
part in their prohibitions confounded
what should be allowed and what
should not be allowed. It is generally
useless to try to prohibit all restraint
on Competition, whether this restraint
be reasonable or unreasonable; and
where it is not useless it is general
ly hurtful. The successful
prosecution of one device to evade
the law immediately develops another
device to accomplish the same pur
pose. What is needed is not sweeping
prohibition of every arrangement,
good or bad, which may . tend to re
strict competition, but such adequate
supervision and regulation as will
prevent other abuses in no way con
nected with restriction of competi
tion." Interstate Commerce. .
I have called your attention in
these quotations to what I have al
ready said because I am satisfied that
it is the duty of the national govern
ment to embody in action the princi
ples thus expressed.
No small part of the trouble that
we have comes from carrying to an
extreme the national virtue of self
reliance, of independence in initiative
and action. It is wise-to conserve this
virtue and to provide for its fullest
exercise, compatible with seeing that
liberty does not become a liberty to
wrong others. Unfortunately, this. is
the kind of liberty that the lack of
all effective regulation inevitably
breeds. The founders of the constitu
tion provided that the national gov
ernment should have complete and
sole control of Interstate commerce.
There was then practically no inter
state - business save such as was con.
ducted by water, and this the national
government at once proceeded to
regulate in thoroughgoing and effec
tive fashion. Conditions have now so
wholly changed that the interstate
commerce by water is insignificant
compared with the amount that goes
by land, and almost all big business
concerns are now engaged in inter
state commerce. As a result, it can
be but partially and Imperfectly con
trolled or regulated by the action of
any one of the several states; such ac
tion inevitably tending to be either
too drastic or else too lax, and In
either case ineffective for purposes of
justice. Only the national govern
ment can m thoroughgoing fashion
exercise the needed control. This
does not mean that -there should be
any extension of federal authority, fur
such authority already exists under
the constitution in amplest and most
far-reaching form; but it does mean
that there should be an extension of
federal activity.
This is not advocating centraliza
tion. It Is merely looking facts in the
face, and realizing that centralization
in business has already come and can
not be avoided or undone; and that
the public at large can only protect
Itself from certain evil effects of this
business centralization by providing
better methods for the exercise of con
trol through the authority already
centralized in the national govern
ment by the constitution itself. There
must be no halt in the healthy con
structive course of action which this
nation has elected to pursue, and has
steadily pursued, during the last six
years, as shown both in the legisla
tion of the congress and the admini
stration of the law by the department
of justice. The most vital need is in
connection with the railroads. As to
these, in my judgment there should
now be either a national incorporation
act or a law licensing railway compan
ies to engage in interstate commerce
upon certain conditions. The law
should be so framed as to give to the
Interstate Commerce commission
power to pass upon the future issue of
securities, while ample means should
be provided to enable the commission,
whenever in its judgment it is neces
sary, to make a . physical valuation of
any railroad.
. As I stated in my message to the
congress a year ago, railroads should
be given power to enter into agree
ments, subject to these agreements
being made public in minute detail
and to the consent of the Interstate
Commerce commission being first ob
tained. XTntil the national government
assumes proper control of interstate
commerce, in the exercise of the
authority it already possesses, it will I
be impossible either to give to or to
get from the railroads full justice. The
railroads and all other great corpora
tions will do well to recognize that
this control must come; the only ques
tion is as to what government body
can most wisely exercise It. The
courts will determine the limits with
in which the federal authority can
exercise It, and there will still remain
ample work within each state for the
railway commission of that state; and
the national Interstate Commerce
commission will work in harmony
with the' several state commissions,
each within its own province to
achieve the desired end. -'
Sherman Anti-Trust Law.
Moreover, in rhy - judgment there
should be additional legislation look
ing to the proper control of the great
business concerns engaged in inter
state business, this control to be exer
cised for their own benefit and pros
perity no less than for the protec
tion of investors and of the general
public. As I have repeatedly said in
messages to the congress and else
where, experience has definitely
shown not merely the unwisdom but
the futility of endeavoring to put a
stop to all "business combinations.
Modern industrial conditions are such
that combination is not only necessary
but Inevitable. It Is so in the world
of business just as it is in the world
of labor, and it is as idle to desire to
put an end to all corporations, to all
big combinations of capital, as to de
sire to put an end to combinations of
labor. Corporation and labor union
alike have come f to stay.. Each if
properly managed Is a source of good
and not evil. Whenever In either
there Is evil. It should be promptly
held to account: but It should receive
hearty encouragement so long as It is
properly managed. It is profoundly
immoral to put or keep on the statute
books a law, nominally In the Interest

was the verdict rendered todav bv the
Jury in the case of Mrs. Annie M. Brad
ley, charged with the murder of former
United States Senator Arthur M.
Brown of Utah, at a hotel in this city
on December 8, last. Amid the ap
plause of a crowd that filled the court
room, Mrs.-Bradley, with tear dimmed
eyes, was discharged from custody and
a trial that has evoked national atten
tion during the past three Weeks was
at an end.
Throughout its deliberations the Jury.
into whose hands the case was deliver
ed by Justice Stafford at . 4:17 o'clock
yesterday afternoon practically stood
at 11 to 1 for acquittal until the final
ballot when the lone Juror, who was
holding out for some form of punish
ment. Juror Julius H. Prlgg gave in
and the verdict of acquittal was agreed
on.
Almost three-quarters of an hour be
fore the time for the opening of court
at 10 o'clock the court began to. fill
with spectators, the majority of them
women. A few minutes before 10 o'clock
word reached the court room that the
jury was ready to report. As the judge
entered the crowd stood while the court
crier announced the opening of the
court with the customary "God save the
government." There was a brief sus
pense, the door opened and the Jury
filed in. The room was so quiet that
a pin could have been heard to drop.
All eyes were fastened on the jury and
all necks were craned in that direc
tion.
Justice Stafford admonished those
present to avoid any demonstration.
Meantime the Jury waited to-deliver its
verdict. Foreman James . eeney
nervously clutching in his hand the doc
ument that meant so much to the frail
and nerve wracked woman in the pris
oner's chair.
Verdict Announced.
'Gentlemen of the Jury," asked the
clerk, "have you reached a verdict?"
We have, answered the ioreman.
What is your verdict; is the defend
ant guilty or not guilty?". i
Every person in the court room.
from judge to spectator, almost
breathlessly awaited the answer.
'Not guilty. replied the foreman.
and "not guilty," echoed every one of
the Jurors.
For a moment in the tenseness of
the excitement, not a word could be
heard, then the suspense was over and
a murmuring "Thank God" from a
group of women who sat on the front
bench was heard through the court
room and was the signal for a demon
stration. The prisoner, who had arrived at
her cell in the city hall a dark, ill
ventilated room directly under the
criminal court an hour before and
remained there with her eldest son,
Arthur, until Just before court con
vened, sat directly back of Attorney
Hoover, her counsel. She was dressed
in black and with suppressed excite
ment watched the Jury. There were
tears in her eyes, but she bore up
bravely.
- Immediately after the Jury deliver
ed its verdict the court thanked the
Jury for the manner in which it
had performed its duty and the
Jury, in turn through its foreman ex
pressed to the court and counsel its
thanks for the consideration and
courtesy shown them.
- - She Is Pleased.
The jury was then discharged and
Mrs. Bradley was released from cus
tody. She was immediately surround
ed by men and women from among
the spectators who pressed upon her
their congratulations. She returned
to the cell from which she had come
to hear the verdict and there she re
ceived a few visitors. She thanked
them for their congratulations and ex
pressed her relief at the conclusion of
her trial. Meantime an automobile
was waiting at a side door and
through a lane of curious spectators
she was escorted to the car, where,
Joined by her counsel and several
woman friends, smiling and bowing to
them as they called to her, she left
the court house. The party returned
shortly afterward but remained out
side the building only a few minutes
and then left for the home of some of
Mrs. Bradley's friends.
Mrs. Bradley herself had little to
say. She expressed gratitude over the
outcome or the trial, wnicn sne naa
confidently anticipated and when ask
ed what plans she had, replied that
there was very little mapped out. At
torney George Hoover of her counsel
said that he felt the verdict was in
accordance with the law and the evi
dence. He began work on the case
almost a year ago, and the result, ht
said, was the culmination that he and
his associates had expected. He had
not had at any time, he added, any
fear of the outcome. Judge Powers,
the senior counsel for the defense, left
last night for Salt Lake City.
United States District Attorney
Baker in discussing the., verdict said:
"Mrs. Bradley was given a fair and
impartial trial. Twelve men on the
Jury have declared her not guilty and
that ends the case so far as the gov
ernment is concerned.
Mrs. Bradley will leave here shortly
for Goldfield. Nevada, there to Join
her sister.

MESSAGtlSREAD
The President's Annual Com
munication to the Congress.
Heard in Both Houses Shortly
After Noon. .
Washington. Dec. 3. The house of
representatives assembled today with
but one object, namely to listen to the
reading of the president s message
and adjourn. The galleries showed
that the interest of the public was al
most as great as on the opening day.
Mr. -ayne (N. x. from the com
mittee appointed to notify the presi-
aent tnat congress was ready to re
ceive any communication he might
wish to make, reported that a mes
sage would soon be sent to the house.
The speaker announced that he had
received a communication that ordin
arily he would refer to a committee
after the organization of the house,
but he thought it so important he
would have it read at once. The pa
per proved to be a telegram from the
Oklahoma legislature to the house of
representatives.
"Oklahoma's first state legislature"
if stated, "just organized. Inspired by
the fond reality of local self govern
ment, sends greeting to the Sixtieth
congress of the greatest nation on
earth and conveys to her sister states
a message of progress and prosperity
and loyal devotion to the union and
the common good."
The speaker himself read this mes
sage in an impressive manner, and
as he concluded the house broke into
applause. A recess was then taken
until 12:30. On reconvening the presi
dent's secretary ; appeared with the
message of the president. It was laid
before the house and its reading was
begun by. the clerk, v Printed- copies
of the document . were distributed
among the members who made a
close scrutiny of the message while
the reader plodded along, apparently
only for the benefit of the people in
the galleries.
In the Senate.
. Washington, Dec. 3. The annua
mn;uj?a rr ih. nrut.nt r tti.i
States was received by the senate at
12:13 p. m. and within a minute
Secretary Bennett had begun the read
ing of 'the document. The message
was presented to the senate by the
assistant secretary to the president,
Mr. Latta, who had followed Senators
Allison and Teller, the committee
which had made the customary call
upon the president.
"We have called upon the presi
dent," said the venerable senator from
Iowa, standing in the center aisle be
side the equally venerable senator
from Colorado, in low and impressive
tones, "and he informs me that he
will communicate with the senate in
writing immediately."
"A message from the president of
the United States," announced Mr.
Latta much more distinctly as the
two committeemen parted to permit
the introduction of the president's
communication. The document was
immediately forwarded to the desk of
the vice president and as soon as the
wrapping could be removed it was
laid before the senate.
The secretary read with delibera
tion and distinctness and was follow
ed closely by many of the senators
who held printed copies of the mes
sage in their hands. The galleries
were crowded and many of the vis
itors also closely listened.
The reading of tne president s mes
sage was concluded at 2:30 p. m. and
the senate went into executive ses
sion and adjourned within a few min
utes. Over 90O Nominations Sent In.
Washington, Dec. 3. The presi
dent today sent to the senate the
nomination of Colonel Charles H.
Whipple, assistant paymaster general
to be paymaster general of the army
to succeed General smfien, who re
tires January 1. The president also
sent to the senate over 900 recess
nominations, most of which have
heretofore been published.
. Bryan Visits Senate.
Washington, Dec. 3. W. J. Bryan
spent an hour in the marble room of
the senate today exchanging
courtesies with senators. Most of the
Democratic members of the senate
called to pay their respects as did also
a number of Republicans, including
Senator Burkett of Mr. Bryan's own
state. Governor Var daman of Mis
sissippi, also was among the dis
tinguished Nebraskan's callers and he
remained for some time in consulta
tion with that gentleman. Mr. Bryan
declared that his visit was without
significance and was only for . the
purpose of meeting his friends of the
senate. He leaves tonight for New
York, whence his daughter and Mrs.
Bryan will sail soon for Europe.

Number of Dead in Naomi Mine Now
Placed at Thirty.
Pittsburg, Pa,, Dec. 3. Up to 10
o'clock this morning 27 bodies had
been recovered from the Naomi coal
mine at Fayette City. The mine offi
cials now believe the dead will not ex
ceed 30, but miners still place the
number of killed at between .40 and
50. Shortly before noon the rescue
parties began to bring out the bodies.
Squads of special police held the
crowd in check as the bodies were
taken from the air shaft. They were
carried to a nearby building erected
for that purpose.

GRAND SUMMARY
Secretary Cohurn GIvesOut Crop
Figures for 1907.
Nineteen Million Dollars In-
crease in Talue of Products.
WHEAT CONDITION 95.9
Indications Favorable to Big
Crop Next Tear.
Value of 1907 Wheat Broke All
Previous Records.
State Products for Ye arA mount
to 280 Per Capita.
After weeks of hard
piling voluminous reports from 2.000
correspondents all over the state, the
Una I flummflrv nf TCa
duction for ian7 n moio nhu
I day by F. D. Coburn, secretary of the
state board of agriculture.
It shows among other things, the
following interesting facts:
Aggregate agricultural and live
stock products for the year were
worth $463,648,606, which is $89,313,
739 ahead of the record.
Wheat production was 74,155,695
bushels; average per acre, 10.24
bushels; value 76.5 cents per bushel;
aggregate value $56,787,512 or $1,
608,801 in excess of any preceding
year.
Corn production 145,288.326 bush
els; average per acre 21 bushels;
averages 43.32 cents per bushel; ag
gregate value $63,040,743, or $6,253,
232 greater than wheat.
Value of products of the year per
capita of population, $280.
The report shows that in the past
10 years, the population of the state
has increased 20 per cent, while the
value of the agricultural and live
stock products has increased 90 per
cent.
Incidentally, Mr. Coburn draws a
moral In his report concerning "mac
aroni wheat" which the United States
department of agriculture experts are
trying to introduce into this "semi
arid belt." Mr. Coburn shows that
macaroni wheat yielded 50 per cent
less per acre, and brought 11.6 cents
less per' bushel.
The following is Mr. Coburn's re
port in full:
Notwithstanding any apparent
shortage in aggregate yields of the
principal, crops, and in spite of car
loads, of imported and home-grown
crop-killers, who by working night
and. day, shifts put in douDle time,
there is a net increase of $19,492,698
in tne value or the year s farm output
over that of 1906. making the total.
as xl jo live biuck values, me great
est in the state's, history.
- In but one year since. 1890' have
Kansas wheat' growers received .so
much per bushel for their wheat as
In 1907, when it averaged 76.5 cents,
the whole amounting to $56,787,513,
or $1,608,801 more than that of any
preceding year. Not in twenty-five
years, excepting 1901, has Kansas
corn been worth so much per bushel.
This year's farm products and live
stock reach the" unprecedented Value
of $463,648,606 or $39,313,739 in ex
cess of the best prior year, which was
1906. This increase Is chiefly from
products of live stock, which were
worth $15,752,000 more than one year
ago, and the value of the state's live
stock on hand, which is nearly $20,
000,000 greater. Tame and prairie
hay, each with diminished tonnage,
are worth more,- and sugar beets, an
item for the first time appearing in
the state's summary of agricultural
products, contribute $435,240 to the
general wealth. It is interesting to
note that the Increase in population
and also of area cultivated Is for each
about 20 per cent over that of ten
year's ago, but the increase, in the
value of the products of the soil
amounts to nearly 90 per cent. Live
stock of all kinds, except sheep, are
not only greater in numbers but of
Improved blood, and those on hand
are worth 109 per cent more than the
live stock of ten ' year's before, while
the percentage of increase In the value
of their products is practically the
same.
On the whole the year has been
most fruitful, and the value of Kansas'
farm products and live stock, appor
tioned equally among her Inhabitants,
would make a credit for each of $280.
The Wheat Crop.
The crop, 74,155,695 bushels, while
less in yield by a fraction over 10
per cent, had a value nearly 3 per
cent greater than that of one year
ago, and is worth more than any prev
ious wheat crop.. Even the record
making yield of over 90 million bush
els in 1903 brought the state's wheat
growers $4,361,157 less, and the value
of the combined wheat crops of the
four years ending with 1896 was not

wealth than its bulkier predecessors
brings out the fact that, with two ex
ceptions, the average price per bushel
in 1907 was higher than that In any
other year of the past quarter of a cen
tury. . The income from this year's
wheat amounts to over one-third of the
total value of all soil products, and its
yield is about three and one-half mil

nual output for the decade ending with
1905.
. The crop this year ranks seventh in
volume, and five of the crops overtop
ping it were of the past eight years.
Of the 1907 growth 921,788 bushels was
