gladly to her son's art, a rich fabric
yellowed with age and finished with
strips of rare old lace.
The performance was a great suc
cess. The children were duly mystified
and more than delighted with the
showers of trinkets and bonbons which
apparently came from an inexhaustible
source. Mrs. Morgan had condescend
ed to express her appreciation, a foot
man had served a supper of such rare
delicacies that Frank had longed to
pack them all up with his parapherna-
foreground and Mrs. .Morgan, a' nys-
terical one, in the background But in
the eyes of the third he read pity, the
same tender pity which lie had seen in
her eyes when Helen Morgan had
stooped to pick up his trick rabbit as
the frightened animal, escaping from
his pocket and trembling at the shouts
of the children, had run to the girl for
protection.
"It's jail for you, young man, unless
yon produce my wife's rings. She left
them behind the rock crystal vase in
the music room, and we don't propose
to have them 'disappeared' as you do
handkerchiefs and rabbits."
The scene which followed was a hor
rible nightmare to the young magician
his own protestations of innocence
drowned In Mrs. Morgan's hysterics.
Senator Morgan's orders for an officer.
Helen's pleading for time to search
and finally the discovery of the rings
by a maid In Mrs. Morgan's dressing
room. And when it was all over Wil
liams was thrust out in the night
through a side entrance, reeling more
like a thief than an acquitted man.
Then suddenly a gentle hand fei: up
on his arm, and a gentler voice mur
mured in his ear:
"Just a minute, please. I want to
tell you how sorry I am. I hoped this
would be the greatest night of your
life"

who had his own way to make and the
girl whose future had been assured so

Innate womanliness which is a great

He spoke quietly, but with new found
coifidence.
It has been a wonderful, wonderful
night to me, and some day I am com
ing back to tell you why."
Under the chaperonago of a dow
ager duchess who knew how to turn
her title to financial account Helen
Morgan was "doing" the London sea
son. In a Mayfair drawing room sue
sat, and "beside lier was a man with a
monocle, an English accent above re

the Morgan millions would meau the

while lt commanded his admiration

Helen Morgan hardly heard what the
man with thenonoc-le was saying.

trembling white hand. Not even the
