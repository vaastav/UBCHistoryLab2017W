IIL Tho proposition of O. P. P, in his
recent message, to so amend the Constitu
tion that slavery may go anywhere under
the shadow of the American flag, is a work
of supererogation; because slavery, th eoUter

as law, is already without restriction save
at the extremes! boundary of the national
domain.
If we could add to the p&mfulfuct which
this advertisement reveals, the other facts
—the African Slave Trade is reopened; a
more atrocious Fugitive Slave Law has
been enacted; all Personal Liberty Laws
have been repealed; the people of the
North bare solemnly agreed to say that
slavery is no wrong, but a natural and in
evitable right, we might then hope that we
should have peace. South Caroline*
free-trade being thrown on the heap, might
stay in the Union four years more.
EXPLANATORY AMENDMENTS.
Sir. Buchanan's proposition to settle the
pending difficulty between Freedom and
Slavery, by incorporating the Breckinridge
Platform into the Constitution of the Uni
icdStates, in “three explanatoiy amend
meats,” is not vciy likely to be accepted by
the Republicans or Douglas men of the
Nonk TVequote from the Constitution
itself, to show the popular ordeal through
wliich the proposition will be forced to
pass, before it accomplishes the purpose in*
tended:
“The Congress, whenevertwo-thirdsof both
houses phnll deem it necessary, shall propose
amendments to this Constitution, or, on the
S plication of the Legislatures of two-thirds of
e several State*, shall call a Convention for
proposing amendments, which, in either case,
shall be valid to all intents and purposes, as
part of this Constitution, when ratillcd by the
Legislatures of three-fourths of the several
States, or by Conventions in three-fourths
thereof os one or the oilier mode of ratification
may be proposed by the Congress.”—Comiitu
tion,AH. r.
In neither one of the ways pointed out
for the amendment of the Constitution, can
"Mr. Buchanan's proposition be carried.
In the Lower House of Congress, the be
lievers in the Breckinridge Platform are in
a meager minority, as they arc in the Leg
iSiaturcs of sixteen free States; hence the
scheme will not be able to advance a single
stop; but if, by the complacency of the law
makers, it should bo referred to the people
for.their decision, it would never be seri
ously beard of more. The men who have
.given Lincoln 183 electoral votes hy unpre
cedented majorities, would see to it, when
electing members of a Convention, that the
Breckinridge heresy had but a feeble rep
resentation in that body. That Sir. Bu
chanan submits a plan so ridiculous, is evi
, donee of the ignorance of popular sentiment,
and of the demands of good government,
winch has made his the most disgraceful
Administration known in American poli
tics.
THli KANSAS SCARE.
"We were informed, some days before the
explosion of the Kansas mare's nest, by a
gentleman whose means of information arc
usual y good, that Capt, Montgomeiy had
not been away from his farm, except on
peaceful errands, for a twelvemonth. We
were Informed further that the whole dis
turbance in Southern whatever it
amounted to, was committed by Jennison,
and sixteen men associated with him; and
that their movements had been confined to
the sum mar}’ arrest and execution of three
or four kidnappers and desperadoes. This
statement, so much at variance with the
letters, dispatches and rumors from the
scene of the alleged conflict, we did not
sec fit then to publish. But it turns out
ihal our informant was substantially cor
rect There is no evidence that Montgom
ery has been engaged in any lawless enter
prises whatever. There Ls no evidence that
the officers of the United States have been
in any way molested, interfered with or
threatened. There is no evidence that any
persons engaged in lawful avocations have
been put to death. But there is abundant
evidence tliat President Buchanan has ap
pointed a lunatic to the Important office of
*‘Judge of the Tliird Judicial District, Kan
sas Territory,” and that the telegraph au
thorities have appointed another as opera
tor or news agent at Warsaw’, Missouri.
These seem to be the net results of the
outbreak—not very important indeed, con
sidering the damor wich has been raised,
but nevertheless acquisitions to the stock
of human knowledge. Doubtless Jennison
and Ills sixteen men committed grave
crimes—for whidi w’e trust they may meet
the full peajdty of the law. Heinous as
we deem the crime of man-stealing to he,
*wc cannot excuse or exculpate him who
takes the law into his own hands—more
especially where he follows it up by the
summary execution of his victims. But
where, we ask, arc the four hundred men
in buckram who levied war against Mis
souri three weeks ago? Where arc the
smoking villages which they left in their
devastating march? Where, oh where,
arc the gallant legions which SL Louis sent
forth to hurl back the invading foe ? When
last heard from they wore toiling slowly,
wearily on, in search of the four hundred
phantoms, with empty stomachs and sore
beds. Probably the number of those who
curse the fools that sent them on such a
chase, is exactly equal to the roll call of the
army. And we doubt not the St Louis
Hepuhlican is the best abused newspaper
in that corps of misguided •warriors, that
■ever issued from the American press.
But lids affair has a serious os well as a
ludicrous side. If the. news-mongers and
letter writers in and around Warsaw, Mo.,
are not to be believed as to matters trans
piring in Kansas, it is to be presumed that
they know what is transpiring at home.
And if they are to be believed in this re
gard, a considerable portion of Western
Missouri has incontinently taken flight.
Towns and farms have been deserted; car
avans of men, cattle and
household goods have beat driven into the
.Interior. Large gangs of slaves have been
sent away from the border. The whole
country round about has been thrown into
a panic. What is the meaning of all this ?
Are thcpeoplc of thafscction such cow
’ ards as to run away in droves from sixteen
jn&randera? Arc they so naturally timid
as to take fright from groundless and im
- probable rumors? We have hud a better
opinion of the average bravery of the An
glo-Saxon race. .We know of border pop
ulous which would calmly await the on
set of-iony forcc”which 'might be mustered
against them from a neighboring Slate, and
let the hardest fend off We know of few
communities in- our jjlder" settled . States
-which would betray such symptoms of in
grained fear from the threatened invasion
'of new -an’d ‘-sparsely settled Territory. In
point of tot, Kansas behaved herself much
better whfen Missouri not only threatened
but actually Invaded Jxer. She fought it
.out and maintained her ground from the
beginning to the lend.' 'What is it then,
which has no undermined and extinguished
.the native valor of our brethren in West
ern Missouri ? Is it the presence of slavciy
among them ? From this distance U looks
pp indeed. :
PERSON AL LIBERTY BILLS.
The President in hla message arraigns
the Personal Liberty Bill, enacted by some
of the free States, as the greatest among the
“outrages” perpetrated upon Southern
rights. The dlsunionlsts of' the South as
sign to these laws, no less prominence in
the category of causes which they assert
furnish cause for secession. It
is assungdt hat they are an outgrowth of
Republicanism, that they are unconstitu
tional, that they nullify a law of Congress,
and that they are so highly offensive to the
South as to afford ample ground for a vio
lent disruption of the Union. Itwillnotbc
amiss to examine these various grounds of
complaint, with the view of ascertaining
whether they furnish any justification of
the course adopted by the secessionists.
1. It is]not true that these Personal Liber
ty Bills were first adopted by Republican
Legislatures. Some of them date-hack
more than a quarter of a century. A ma
jority of them were adopted by Whig and
Democratic Legislatures. The Ohio Taw
was enacted In 1831; the New Jersey law
in 1840; that of Rhode Island in 1848.
On the adoption of the last-named law,
only one-third of the Whigs and less than
one-seventh of the Democrats in the Legis
lature voted against it The Massachusetts
law was not adopted by a Republican Leg
islature; and some of its most stringent
features were on the point of being repealed
by a Republican Legislature, when the bru
tal assault upon Senator Sumner by Brooks,
of South Carolina, effected a change of
their purpose. In each of the States named,
there have been both Democratic and
Whig Legislatures since the enactment of
the laws In question, but In no instance
has any attempt been made to repeal them
by either of these parties.
2. It is only oflaleyears,'and since the dis
unionists per se. have sought for a pretext
to cany out their that objections
have been raised against these Personal
Liberty Bills. The decision of the Supreme
Court of the United Stales in the case of
Prigg vs. The State of Pennsylvania, dear
ly recognized two principles which appear
to lie at tho basis of all such State law.*,
1. That the legislation of Congress in re
lation to the rendition of fugitive slaves,
not only superseded all State legislation up
on the same subject, but “by neccasay im
plication prohibited it” [See 17 Petess, page
017.] 2. That the State Legislatures may
prohibit all State officers from aiding in the
.execution of the Fugitive Slave Law. [See
1G Peters, page 022.] And this last point
seems to cany with it the right of the States
to withhold the use of their jails for
the confinement and safe-keeping of fugi
tives. At all event-, these Personal Liber
ty Bills were recognized in their ear
lier history as in perfect acccord
with the above named decision of the Su
preme Court, and the South acquiesced in
them without a word of protest. So much
for the histoiy of these laws and of the sup
posed constitutional right of the Slates to
enact them.
3. But it is now said that they arc un
constitutional. The President, in his last
Message, goes even farther Ilian Hits, and
asserts that they are “Null and Void.” If
the President is right, he places his politi
cal friends in the attitude of attempting the
disruption of the Union onnccount of amcrc
nullity. But suppose the laws to be unconsti
tutional, as is now claimed—is secession the
remedy? The South can certainly trust
thisjnattcr to the decision of the Supreme
Court as it is at present constituted. And
if the Supreme Court decide against the
constitutionality of the Personal Liberty
Bills, no one of the States in which they
exist will attempt thereafter to enforce
them.
4. But it is further said that they arc in
the nature of nullifying laws—that they
practically’ defeat the execution of the Fu
gitive Slave Law. How? Has not the
Federal Government the ability to execute
a law of Congress, unless it can have the
co-operation of State officers and the use
of Slate prisons ? To assume that such is
the fact is, to say the vcit least, a poor
compliment to the efficiency of our Gov
ernment. But admit that it is so—is seces
sion the remedy ? South Carolina once at
tempted to nullify the laws of Congress>
but General Jackson, with the aid of Con
gress, soon brought the refractoiy Shite to
terms. Cannot the Executive and Con
gress do the same now with respect to any
free State that may attempt nullification V
Nay, in the fact of their greater loyalty to
the Union, is it not reasonable to infer
that the free States would much more
readily abandon the ground of nullification,
in response to the demands of the constituted
authorities, than would any of those South
ern States which have been so long restive
within the Union, and solicitous for a pre
text to get out of it ?
5. But if these laws arc neither uncon
stitutional, nor of the nature of nullifying
enactments, then, according to all received
notions of the doctrine of State rights,
tiic States which have adopted them have
an indefeasible right to maintain them; and
it is a gross impertinence, an unjustifiable
breach of Stale comity, and in derogation
of popular sovereignty, for any other Stale
to ask their repeal With the citizens of
the States which have placed these laws
upon their Statute-books, it is a mere ques
tion of choice and expediency whether
they retain them or not It is their busi
ness, and theirs alone, and they would be
unworthy of freedom if they tolerated any
outside interference.
6. That they may be offensive to some of
ihe people of the South is probably true.
There is a class there who, like the Irish*
man at Donnybrook Fair who begged
some one to tread upon his coat-tail, are
exceedingly anxious to have offence given
them. But it cannot be that the slavehold
ing Slates generally regard these laws in
any such light. If they did, we should
have heard of it long ago. They would
have complained as soon as the offence had
been given. Nor should wc now find upon
the statute-books of some of the slavehold
ing States just as stringent Personal Liber
ty Bills as the most “offensive” of those
complained of by the secessionists. Vir
ginia has a Personal Liberty Bill which, if
taken as a pattern by the free States, would
add much to the stringency of their present
laws. But admit that they are “ offensive”
to the South—what then ? Is the fact that
one State enacts a law which is “ offensive”
to another State, a sufficient ground %or
thi latter to secede from the Union? If
this doctrine be admitted, the free States
ought to have seceded long ago. There
are fifteen States of this Union by whose
laws men and women and their posterity
forever, are compelled to hopeless life-long
bondage, than which nothing can be more
abhorrent or “offensive” to the people of
the free Stages. Nevertheless the latter
have bowed to the doctrine of State sov
ereignty, and have never once assigned
these offensive laws as a justification for se
cession. It remained for the Secessionists
to promulgate a doctrine which, if lived up
to rigidly, would at once explode our con
federacy and forever prevent any two of
the States from uniting again under a com
mon government.
—Such are the conclusions to which an
analysis of this sabject most inevitably lead.
The whole thing is the result of an after
thought—a mere trumped-up pretext for
contemplated treason and for new demands
upon Northern servility. We do not pre
sume to pronounce upon the constitution
ality or the expediency of these laws. It
is not necessary that we should. Illinois has
not adopted them, nor has she the right or
the desire to interfere with those States
that have. As a constituent member of
this Confederacy, it is enough for her to
know, that if any of the .States have been
wronged, they’have a fall and complete
remedy under the Constitution and within
the Union. Let those remedies beapplied
if there IsJhe least occasion for them; if
.there is not, let the Secessionist*citherhold
their peace, or have the manliness to-put
their action upon the true ground. Let us
hayo no mors whining over grievances
that may be remedied, if they have an exis
tence, and no more hypocritical pretences
for bald and unmitigated treason.
IN OP AN ENEMY.
Hardships of Hie Missouri Militia*
Tbs largo force sent by the Governor of Mis
souri to drive back certain mythical invaders
from Kansas, arc having a rough time.. Wo
quote from tbo Missouri Democrat' t article,
headed “ The Military Expedition
This huge blunder Is still persisted in, ns tbe
correspondence of the morning papers but too
plainly sb. ws. Tet Oov. Stuart must have
abundant information that the Commonwealth
over which he presides is wholly Intact—has
not been invaded, nor is in any danger of be
ing invaded. The reconnoissancc made by
Col, Snyder, and which Is reported by tele
graph lids morning, officially establishes these
essential points, and gags the foolish newspa
pers which have been trying to manufacture a
panic out out of the yams spun by Judge Wil
liams. As for as Missouri Is concerned, the
story of the fugitive Judge turns out lobe
pure fiction; but the t'to ardent soldiery 1 of
St Louis found it anything but a joke. It' is
known that the rank and file arc travel
soiled, fotigued, foot-sore, and in many
Instances, lamed and sick. Were they Rus
sian Zouaves, equally accustomed to the rigors
of an arctic climate, aud severe physical exer
cise, these forced marches in December, alter
nating with days of comparative inertia, would
use them up, tiAry mau... The lino of country
along which they arc moving, necessitates, we
arc told, such marches; but that fact should
have served to restrain the rashness of the
Commander-In-Chief and the General In com
mand in precipitating them forward. We ven
ture to say that such prodigal and wholly use
less waste of human energy and military ar
dor has not been witneaseom the country from
the beginning, as this Southwestern expedi
tion. The men arc experiencing all the hard
ships of war. unrelieved by anyone of its Illu
sions. What do we sec ? Six or seven hun
dred men marching, in the depth of winter,
through the enow, over mud roads interspersed
with half-frozen sloughs, carrying heavy knap
sacks and muskets, and sleeping at night on the
cold frost-baked ground, yet so fcvcicd by the
exhausting toils of the day that tbe plunge lor
relief Into the ice-running streams as soon os
a halt Is ordered. No doubt it Is very heroic;
but what good will it do—what useful purpose
will It serve, we ask ? The disciplining of our
citizen soldiery, answers a writer in the Buße
tin, who would doubtless shrink with horror
from the shower bath these mornings, how
ever much bis brain-pan might require such an
application. Sitting at home by tbo fire, we
may be os loud os we please In praise of the
worth of discipline; but fatigue, hunger,
lameness and sickness are very ugly focts,
and very aggravating ones to the sufferers, not
withstanding all that theoretical ascetics and
stoics may say to the contrary. Common sense
always demands that the cud proposed to be
accomplished should bear some proportion to
the efforts and sacriliccs made to attain it; but
efforts and sacrifices directedtono object, orto
one confessedly impossible, arc a pure waste of
force, and as little to be applauded as any oth
er senseless extravagance. Some undertakings
which fall, compensate for their failure by the
Incidental benefits resulting from their prose
cution ; but ibis military undertaking can be
productive of no incidental good whatever to
those on whomitsprinclpalburdcns fall,much
less t ’ the end for which it was ostensibly or
ganised. We told the soldiers at the outset
that it would place them in a very absurd po
sition, and we doubt not they realize the
truth of the prediction now. They must be
conscious that the whole thing isacolloseal
humbug, springing from tbe barbaric vanity
of certain Generals and Colonels. Neither
Montgomery nor any of bis gang lias dared to
come inside the Stale line. It is therefore Im
possible for Gen Frost and bis command to
chastise or capture the bold outlaw, while it Is*
but certain Gen. Harney will do both. We
must thcrcfojc continue to protest against a
movement which can accomplish nothing bnt
to subject the State to heavy expenditure, and
the citizen soldiery of St. Louis—the flower of
our population— to great physical hardship.
FBO.TI WASHINGTON
Various Facts and Speculations
[Special Dispatch to the N. Y. Time?.}
Washington, Bee. 2.18C0.
A quorum of both branches of Congress is
present, and business will therefore commence
at once. All the New England, Pennsylvania,
and nearly all the Western, New York and Cot
lon State members have arrived. Senators
Chesnut and Hammond arc nut here, and will
not be. South Carolina will not reappoint
them nor choose successors.
There arc two hues of policy marked out
and discussed in political circles respecting the
course to be pursued by the Republican and
Democratic parties in Congress at the opening
of the present session. Among the Republi
cans, one Is to propose compromises, aud
make leading conciliatory speeches, as men
tioned in the dispatches vesterdnv; the other
to maintain silence aud allow the South to
speak, and, if possible, let the two parties
from the South discuss the matter themselves,
and settle it among themselves exclusively.
The Union party in the South is strongly
represented on the floor of Congress, aud tlTey
having all their interests involved, can speak
freely and without fear of provoking their op
ponents. But it is feared that the Southern
men, both for purposes of intimidation and
effect,will pursue exactly the same line ofpohey,
keeping silence, and declaring, in the language
ofthclrlcadiug urators.that “the lime for words
i» iiast—they desire and intend immediate, un
compromising action. The Union men of
the South, however, will not permit this on
the part of either party. They have deter
mined to call for prompt explanations, and a
settlement of the present ditllcultics between
the North and the South, aud will put bolh sec
tions on the defensive, thereby making them
speak. Such 1 find to be the opiniou of lead
ing men with whom I have conversed.
It begins to look as though a majoritv of
the Republicans would compromise in any
honorable way; but Keit, of South Carolina,
says distinctly that South Carolina will not
compromise except upon her mm terms; that
she will not yield an iota; that she desires ser>-
aration, peaceably if she can, forcibly if she
must,"
All the Republicans I have talked with any
they will not yield the right to take Slavery
into the Free Territories; if it comes to that
iw»nc alone, all the Cotton States may go and
welcome; neither will they yield the re-opening
of the African Slave-trade, nor the right of
Mr. Lincoln to the unanimous support of the
country, aud to make up his Cabinet as he sees
tit. without explanation or reservation.
I am satisfied that they will bland firm and
unflinchingly by their party principles, al
though the lael stares them In the face that the
Cotton Stales will, beyond doubt, attempt a
rupture and nullification. Every one looks so
ber, in view of the great events which must
probably soon transpire.
Many gentlemen think the present session
will not continue three weeks. This is not
plausible, however, as supposlngnll the South
ern members retire, there will elill he a quo
rura, and business will proceed.
A resolution already prepared will be thrust
in at the earliest moment, declaring the right
of a State to secede at will. The preamble sets
forth the grievances put upon the South bv
the North, aud the necessity for an independ
ent Government. The whole subject will thus
be opened. It is urged by some, however, that
the movement Is undignified, and it mar he
abandoned. The resolution would be over
whelmingly rejected, and the South Carolina
members would then withdraw. It is not vet
settled who shall Introduce it. No State will
vote unanimously for secession but South
Carolina. An attempt will be made by the
Republicans to get the Appropriation bills
through first. Several gentlemen advise the
withholding of the pay of members until these
bills pass. Mr. Sherman, Chairman of the
Committee of Ways and Means, is fully pre
pared to press them.
Several persons appeared yesterday sporting
the cockade and Palmetto, although most of
those possessing them have sense enough to
carry them in their pockets. The new badge
to be worn on the coat is a silver Palmetto
with a blue background. It is neat and showy.
Mr. Leach of North CarolinS says his State
will stand by the Union under all circum
stances.
Mr. Bouligny, of Louisiana, says all his cor
respondence indicates undivided Union senti
ments, and that the North can no more repeal
their obnoxious measures under threats than
the South can remain in the Union under force.
Messrs. Anderson of Missouri, Adams of
Kentucky, and Burnett of Kentucky, are
stronglyUniou.
Messrs. Nelson and Etheridge sav that Ten
nessee cannot be forced out by actual Northern
aggression.
It is stated on the best authority that Messrs.
Cobb and Thompson have Instigated the re
ports that they were going out of the Cabinet
to keep themselves before the public, and at
tract attention from the condition of the
Treasury. Cobb’s report is not ready, lie can
no longer cover ap his miserable failure, ex
cept by a new loan, aud, In the present condi
tion of affairs, it is doubtful if the loan would
be taken.
The Republicans hare generally decided to
maintain silence as to secession, as it cannot
properly be discussed until some action af
fords n cause for it.
The Pacific Railroad Committee are ready to
vote two lines of road—one Central and the
other extreme South. This may have some
condliatiug effect.
A revised tariff bill has been prepared during
the recess by several gentlemen well acquaint
ed with the subject.
The “ Marsellaisc” has been adopted as the
air of the revolutionists, with the hope, proba

Testimonial to Col. Baxeu.— -The San
Francisco correspondent of the New York
World relates the following incident, which
will bo read with interest by the numerous
friends of Col. Baker living in this city:
‘ Hon. E. D. Baker; the new Republican Sena
tor from Oregon, was among the eastward
bound passengers to-day. On the night of the
Bth instant, (November,) CoL Baker "was pre
sented with a magnificent set of silver plate
from the merchants of San Francisco. The
ornaments of the service are very rich, and are
emblematic of a railroad and train of cars. The
set cost $4,000. It was not a testimonial to
political prominence, but simply a compli
mentary token to a gentleman who has done
much for the advancement of the literary In
stitutions of San Francisco.
The plate bears ths following inscription :
“ Presented to E. D. Baker by the merchants
of San Francisco, as s token of their esteem

NULLIFICATION IN 1832 AND SECESSION
IN 1860.
Ucvlnr of the History of the Kalllfl*
cation Movement In 1832—Public
Sentiment at the South Then and
Now,
[From the X. V. Times.]
Those whose lives have been so protracted
as to enable them to remember the crisis of
1833-33, cannot fall to be impressed with the
various points in common, and points of con
trast, between thb events of that period snd
those of the present day. Acting upon con
victions of more or less'sinecrity and Intensi
ty, South Carolina twenty-eight years ago felt
herself compelled to question the impartiality
and Impugn the authority of the Federal Gov
ernment, and misinterpreting and misapply
ing the platform of Southern Republicanism
contained in the Virginia resolutions of 1798-
99, asserted the right of a State to set at defi
ance the enactments of Congress, and, if nec
essary, to withdnnvfrom the Confederation.
The origin, character and event of the conflict
provoked by those positions throw so much
light upon the actual condition of things, that
It cannot be otherwise than instructive to re
call their leading historical points.
THE TARIFF OP 1810.
The nullification contest of 1833 bad Its
sonreo In that sectional jealousy which seems
now to have reached Its culmination. Upon
emerging from the war of 1812 with Great
Britain, with some glory, but withthcachievc
ment of the objects for which the war was de
clared, the principal result of value left to the
American people was the lesson taught by its
deprivations through the long period of non
intercourse, the embargo, and the actual con
flict. Without any individual resources at the
commencement of this epoch, throughout this
period of commercial suspension, the utmost
inconvenience and even suffering were felt for
the want of the necessaries and comforts for
which the country had been dependent upon
English factories and markets; and all classes
and all sections joined in the demand for the
adoption of such measures of encouragement
to home industry, ns In any similar contingen
cy should render ns Independent. The protec
tive Tariff of 3SIC was the product of this na
tional wont. Adopted with the free consent of
all the States, it at once gave the anticipated
impetus JLo domestic manufactures; but ow
ing to the peculiarities of Southern labor, and
the superior enterprise, energy and ingenuity
of the Northern States, it was soon found that
the impulse was felt almost exclusively at the
North, while the South, by Us absence of com
petition, Lad simply exchanged dependence
upon Old for dependence upon New England.
It was also asserted that the enhanced price
mid for the commodities of Northern manu
facture, under the tariff, was paid by the con
sumers at the South and elsewhere; and an
additional reason for jealousy was discerned In
this fact. There were not wanting Southern
orators to point to three pence extra upon the
yard of cotton cloth, which the South had to
pay for the advantage of Hie North; and the
Impossibility of obtaining a ton of Welsh iron
without a tribute of five dollars to furaaccmeu
in Connecticut or New Jersey. At each suc
cessive revival of the tariff during the Admin
istration of Presidents Monroe and Adams,
these complaints became louder; and were
accompanied, on the part of leading men from
South Carolina, with threats of nullification,
and new doctrines of State rights pointing to
the policy of secession.
THE TARIFF OF 1823.
The protective tariff of IS2B gave a fierce and
more menacing tone to these popular mutter
ing The election of Andrew Jackson, with
Mr. Calhoun upon the ticketas Vice-President,
in the fall of that year, served to calm the ex
treme agitation—-for Gen. Jackson was chosen
upon the strength of his opposition to tbuAd
:uu*’policy; while Mr. Calhoun, who had. In
1816, been the foremost advocate of protec
tion, had now avowed his predilections for
Free Trade. In those days, the revision of the
tariff was a prime electioneering Instrument,
put to use invariably on the eve of a Presiden
tial contest. Prior to the quadrennial discus
sion of 1832, an event had occurred which
alarmed the South. A personal quarrel had
taken place between the Vice-President and
the Chief Magistrate, arising out of events
which had occurred during the administration
of Monroe; it had produced a rupture of the
Cabinet, and a violent pamphlet controversy.
It also gave rise to a faction in Congress,
known as the friends of Mr. Calhoun, whose
prominent doctrine was Free Trade. The ef
forts and the threats of this small but formida
ble faction were not without effect in procur
ing some trifling reduction in tbc tariffof July
14,1832; but the concessions were insufficient
to satisfy a population, who, for merely politi
cal purposes, had been inflamed beyond the
possibility of sudden calm; and besides, it was
the hope of Mr. Calhoun and bis friends, hv
keeping the agitation alive until November, to
turn the election unfavorably for Gen. Jackson.
This desire was all the stronger, for the reason
that Mr. Calhoun had been refused a renoml
nation for the Vice-Presidential chair, that
honor having been given to Mr. Van Karen,
the object of especial vengeance with the Cal
houn party, which regarded him as the subtle
source of its humiliation, and as the “ Mordc
cai who sat within the While House gates.”
The cries of Free Trade and State Rights were
therefore kept up with all practical vigor; and
the South was given to understand that both
these cries would have to be hushed, should
General Jackson, a staunch Unionist, cam'the
election.
THE FIRST CONTENTION.
On the 25th of October, 1832, summoned by
the advice of Mr. Calhoun and Gen. llayue,
and by the call of Gov. Hamilton, the Legisla
ture of South Carolina met iu special session,
aud passed a law authorizing a State Conven
tion to be held, a month later, to consider the
action proper for the State, in view of the
usurpations of the Federal Government. The
Convention met, Gen. Jackson having in the
interm obtained the popular vote tor the
Presidency, aud at ouee, Nov. 24, adopted uu
ordinance, reciting the hardships resulting to
the State from the revenue laws, especially the
Acts of May 19,1823, and of July 14,1832: re
viewing the fruitless efforts of South Carolina
to procure some mitigation of those oppres
sive laws, and declaring that nothing was then
left but resistance. The method of resistance
was set forth. The Acts iu question were de
claret to be null and void. It was made a
penal offence for a Federal or State oflicerto
attempt to enforce them after Feb. 1,1833.
The Legislature was required to pass laws to
protect the citizen in Ills refusal to pay duties.
An appeal in any civil action arWng before the
State Courts was in no ease to
to go to the Supreme Court of the United
States. And any attempt of the Federal Gov
ernment to enforce the revenue laws, either
by armed force or by closing the ports, was to
be considered a severance of the ties which
bound South Carolina to the Union, and os au
thorizing a resumption of her sovereignty as
an Independent State. The ordinance was ac
companied by a justificatory address to the
people of the United States.
gov. Hamilton’s message.
The adjournment of the Convention was fol
lowed, Nov. 27, hy the meeting of the Legisla
ture, to whom Gov. Hamilton, in submitting
the ordinance, delivered an Inflammatory ad
dress. The wrongs suffered by the South at
the hands of the North: the 'special acts of
legislation complained of; the propriety of
having well undestood that should the United
Statespersist in collecting revenue after Feb.
1, 1533, that South Carolina would secede; the
necessity of authorizing Custom-House clear
ances by the State; and of levying an army of
at least 12,000 men, were prominent topics of
the Governor’s Message. The Legislature re
sponded to its suggestions. A series of acts
was passed,providing for “the security and
protection of the people of South Carolina.”
authorizing an oath of exclusive obedience to
the State laws required by the ordinance.” and
a variety of other enactments of a revolution
ary character.
JACKSON'S PROCLAMATION.
In the mean time, the Federal authorities
had not been unobservant. The annnal Mes
sage of Gen. Jackson, Dec. 4, 1832, had briefly
rclerred to the course of events in South Car
olina, adding a pledge that the laws, at the
proper time, should be duly enforced, and ex
pressing his belief that 'the Constitutional
powers of the Exaentive were suflicicnt forthc
crisis, without legislative assistance. On the
10th of the same month appeared the Presi
dent’s Proclamation to the People of South
Carolina, in which he argued the question of
nullification and secession; and gave his judg
ment strongly against the right In either ease;
and after warning the people to desist from
their revolutionary plans, he declared his in
tention to use the utmost power assigned him
to enforce obedience to the laws.
-THE FORCE BILI
Iu the meantime, Gen. Haync, whose une
qual contest in the United States Senate with
Mr. Webster, is bis principal claim to recol
lection, had been Inaugurated as Governor.
In bis address on the occasion he employed all
the eloquence with which he was so richly
gifted, to inflame still further the spirit of re
sistance, and bis proclamation of December
20, in response to that of the President, after
re-stating the arguments relied upon by the
imllificre to justify their views of the Federal
compact and its obligations, bade the people
take arms in preparation for the that
was plainly inevitable. While, however, the
enrollment of troops under this invocation was
proceeding very slowly, the President was ac
tive in moving troops and vessels to the vicin
ity of Charleston, and In otherwise demon
strating bis resolute intentions. On the Hth
of January, 1833, Mr. Calhoun laid on the ta
ble of the Senate absolution calling upon the
President for information with regard to the
South Carolina difficulty, with copies of all
collateral documents. Two days later these
were sent In, accompanied bya message enter
ing with detail into the historical and consti
tutional question connected with the subject,
and suggesting at the same time some conces
sions to the demands of the South, and some
additional measures for strengthening the
bands of the Executive, antecedent to a final
appeal to arms. The latter suggestion gave
rise to the measure very absurdly styled the
“Force BUL” It was a*measure Introduced
hythc Administration party, authorizing the
President, In case the collection of revenue
should be interfered with at any established
port of entry, to close such port, and to trans
fer the Custom-honsc to some other point. It
also gave protection to United States Marshals
In the performance of their duties. This bill
became a law March 1,1833, three days before
the dose of that Congress.
TUB QUEST COMPROMISE.
It was preceded, however, by another meas
ure, of a pacificatory character, the parentage
of which was due to Mr, Clay, and its success
to Mr. Clayton. On the 12ih*of February, ISIS,,
the former Introduced Into the Senatca'billfor
the modification of the tariff, which became
known as the Compromise bill ' It provided
for the gradual redaction of the dnties to a
revenue standard through a period of eight
yean and a half. A violent but not prolonged
contest ensued. Mr. Calhoun and his partisans
were brought to Us support, by a knowledge
that the President contemplated the arrest of
that leader upon a charge of high treason, and
a demand forhis impeachment. Mr. Webster,
sustained by other Northern Senators, opposed
the bill, because they believed it derogatory to
the Federal Government thus to make conces
sions to rebels with arms In their baud?. The
bill, however, passed both Houses with slight
amendment, and became a law Feb. 25,
EFFECT OP CONCILIATION.
In the presence of this conciliatory legisla
tion, the vitality of the nullification movement
disappeared. There was still a display of mil
itary, and a profusion of cockades; but the
revenues were collected on and after Feb. 1,
end South Carolina did not secede. The Inter
mediation of Gen. Scott, who was promptly
sent to Charleston, in a partly martial and
partly mediatorial capacity, did much to pre
vent collision; and the knowledge that the
idea of concession bad been suggested by the
President, and accepted by such men as Clay,
Clayton and Calhonm did still more. The storm
gradully subsided. It was no longer necessary
to maintain on extraordinary armament at
Charleston. Gov. Hayno dismissed his troops,
with a rhetorical flourish on the victory they
had gained over the Federal Government, and
the winter of Southern discontent bad before
May of 1833 yielded to a glorious summer.
South Carolina boasted of its triumph over the
North; it was only Mr. Calhoun and a few of
the more Intelligent of his party who under
stood howmneh had been sacrificed, and bow
transient was the security they hod gained.
In thus hastily recapitulating the chronolog
ical data of this period, we have refrained from
measuring the popular sentiment then preva
lent by what we witness to-day. It will better
serve onrpnrposc to present this aspect of the
.subject singly.
THEN AND NOW,
The actual movement at the present time at
the South presents the entire body of the peo
ple of South Carolina In a state of hostility to
Federal authority, and determined to throw
off its yoke. In the grievances which are al
leged os the origin of this determination we
find fifteen Southern States sympathizingwith
more or less Intensity; while in Alabama,
Florida, Mississippi and Georgia, there seems
to be a practical unanimity in favor of follow
ing at once the lead of South Carolina. In the
remainderof the Sontbem States the disunion
sentiment, though not in the ascendant, has
obviously a very wide and dangerous preva
lence.
TOE DIFFERENCE.
In 1832, however, the case was greatly dif
ferent. Then the cause of discontent was as
at present, a jealousy of the North, and a belief
that the burdens of Government were unfairly
distributed, andThc rights of the South disre
garded: and the remedy proposed was anala
gous; for, when challenged to draw a distinc
tion between nullification and secession, the
leaders of the movement were constrained to
admit the phrases to be equivalent. But the
remedy now so generally approved was then
accepted by a mere handful of the Southern
people. In the Congressional election at
Charleston in the fall of 1832, the nullification
candidate, the editor of the Mercury - then, as
now, the organ of secession—was elected bv
only 130 majority. The Charleston Cvurur
was a strong advtftatc of the Union. A Union
State Convention was held at Columbia, Sept.
12,1832, at which multitudes were present, and
nullification was denounced chiefly because it
was subversive of the Constitution and of the
national liberties. A irreat popular Union
meeting at Columbia, OcL 25, used even vio
lent language In condemnation of the nullifi
era; and at Lancaster Court House, in the
month of December, a mass meeting, presided
over by Major Gibson, an influential planter,
protested in energetic terms against the ordi
nance of nullification, and approved the coer
cive measures threatened by Gen. Jackson.
Among the leading men pledged to the cause
of the Union were Chancellor Harper, Joel K.
Poinsett, CoL Drayton, Judge Pettigrew. In
the popular elections of the autumn of 1832,
according to the Charleston Here ary, there
were 45,000 rotes cast, and the nullification
majority was but 8,000. In the Legislature, at
the special session of October, the act calling
a Convention had a vote of 31 to 14 in the Sen
ate, and 97 to 27 in the House; and a I rge
number avowedly voted with the majority,
who deprecated any extreme act ion on thepart
of the Convention. And that the sense of the
Slate might be tested, the Union party deter
mined to put forth candidates for cverv seat
the Stale was entitled to in Congress.
FURTHER COMPARISONS,
Nor was the military ardor, save in Charles
ton, of alarming heat. In that cUv troops
were drilled to defend the State, In the event
of Federal coercion; but troops almost as nu
merous were drilled to aid iu enforcing the na
tional laws. So high and bitter ran the feud
between these military heroes, that it became
necessary to assign certain portions of the citv
to each exclusively to put a stop to hostile col
lisions. In the rural districts much complaint
was made at the tardiness of (he enrolment.—
The press in the Interior was equally divided
between the rival parties; and while one side
invited, the other discouraged volunteering.—
In January, 1833, the ranks of the Shite army
were still meagre. The Greenville
cer t published m a district where now a Union
man would perish by Lynch-law, gloried in the
universal difficulty of finding volunteers; and
speaking of that Immediate region, says,
“Many who have been hitherto drawn along
with the nuUifiers arc now ready for anv ex
tremity in defense of the Uniou and civil lib
erty. No Union man in the District, and very
few of the nuUifiers, would shoulder a musket
to fight against the Star Spangled Banner.” In
short, to use the language of the FtiUonal In-
UtUgcnccr at the time, “The majority of the
people in the State were ripe for this rash and
desperate attempt. The minority, however,
were strong enough to dare to be bold.” The
same reliance was placed on volunteered assis
tance from without as at present. We find
the Columbus Times declaring that “throngs
of volunteers In aid of nullification might he
expected from Alabama, Georgia, North Caro
lina and Virginia, although the Legislatures of
all those States arc unanimously adverse to the
cause.” . *
TUB SOUTH OUTSIDE OF CAROLINA.
Aud this remark carries us beyond the fron
tiers of South Carolina. While the provoking
cause which led that State to extreme meas
ures was as keenly felt by all the Southern
States, and obtained their ardent sympathy,;
* that sympathy tru» exchanged for universal*
condemnation; when nullification and seces
sion were proposed. It wonld be sufficient to
demonstrate tub fact, to refer to the debates
in Congress npon the so-called Force bill—a
debate which clearly elicited the views of.
Southern members. -They were geucrallv op
posed to conceding anything to South Caroli
na, while she retained her menacing attitude;
denounced her couree as rash aud uncalled for;
agreed in recognizing its revolutionary charac
ter, aud approved the application of’coercive
measures?. The Legislatures of Kentucky,
Tennessee, Alabama, Georgia, Virginia and
North Carolina, passed, almost unanimously in
every instance, resolutions condemnatory of
the uulliflcrs, and denying the right of seces
sion. Gov. Lumpkin, in his Me»s:ige to the
Legislature of Georgia, stigmatized" imlliflca
tion as dangerous and delusive iu practice as
iu theory, and the Legislature In reply passed
resolutions respecting the ** abhorrent doctrine
of nullification os neither a peaceful nor a con
stitutional remedy, but on the contrary*, as
tending to civil commotion and disunion; and,
while we deplore, they say, the rash and revo
lutionary measures recently adopted by a Con
vention of South Carolina, we deem it a par
amount duty to warn our fellow-citizens
against adopting her mischievous poli
cy.” This tone of Georgian sentiment is
the more remarkable, because Georgia had Just
emerged from a contest with tbc Federal Gov
ernment, which might reasonably have left her
embittered feelings, and ready to sympathize
with any similar champion. The only note
worthy exception to this accord of principle
was shown at a dinner in Oglethorpe, in
August, 3832, where Judge Clarion, who laid
been the master-mind of the federal conflict
referred to, was the principal speaker, and was
too fresh from the encounter not to give oue
more peal of his war-trumpet to cheer South
Carolinx All the candidates fur Congress
that Tall were interrogated on nullification,
and only those were elected who disclaimed It,
aud swore abiding allegiance to the Union.
With regard to Alabama, not only do the reso
lutions "of the Legislature, but the public
journals of that day attest, that “ Nullifica
tion was utterly rejected." In Louisiana, a
mass meeting, overwhelming in numbers and
influence, was held at New Orleans, Jan. 2, to
denounce the attitude of South Carolina, Iu
North Carolina,beyond the Legislative resolves,
the voice of condemnation found expression at
all the county militia gatherings, where resolu
tion* of censure were in every instance adopt
ed ; and the clergy of all denominations met at
the capital to express their sorrow and indig
nation at the course of the neighboring State.
The resolutions adopted in Virginia, demand
ing an unconditional repeal of the imlfifioalion
ordinance, and arguing that the resolutions of
1798 afforded no authority for the pretensions
of South Carolina, were sent to Columbia by
Jic hands of Mr. B. Watkins Leigh, as Special
Commissioner. There is no doubt, that South
Carolina was wholly destitute of external ap
probation for her extreme measures; and that
when, cn April 2,1833, Gov. llayue lamented
to the troops when disbanding them, (hut
South Carolina, ** Instead of receiving sympa
thy and support from those whose interests
were identified with her own,” had been left
to contend single-handed, that be spoke with
with deep feeling and perfect troth.
CONCLUSION*.
We shall hare fulfilled the aim of these re
marks, if ivc bare shown, on the one bond,
that the cause which moved South Carolina to
revolt in 1532, was essentially the same as that
which actuates her now; that it equally ap
pealed to sectional feeling, and was equally
common to the other slave States; aud on the
other bond, that It failed to enlist in extreme
measures, not only the whole of those States,
Sonth Carolina excepted, but that even in
South Carolina there was a large and jKJwcrful
minority who remained faithful to the Union.
In these latter circumstances lies the painful
and threatening contrast between that period
and the present. Even with the energy aud
resolution of Gen. Jackson at the head of af
fairs, it is extremely doubtful whether the re
sult would have been what it was, had the mass
of the Sonth approved nullification, as tbev
now approve the same doctrine in its devel
oped form of secession. But happily for that
day, disunion was a word of horror, from which
men shrunk abashed. The revolutionary pe
riod was too recent, and Its battle-fields
still too green with the richness of
patriotic blood, for men lightly to talk
of throwing awiy what had been so dear
ly but gloriously purchased. lie was
a bold man then whoavbispered treason to the
Union. The lapse of twenty years have famil
iarized all men with the idea, and the word has
become so common as to be in the month of
everybody. Indeed, it is painfnl to think, that
where, at' that day the apostle of sesessiou
would have stood a perilous chance of corning
martyrdom, the same fate now impends over
the apologist of the Union. The cloud the
size of a man’s band has swolen so as to cover
the horizon. Nullification and secession, from
being the profession of an obscure faction,
liovc become the ruling faith of one-third of
the Union, and threaten to involve the remain
der in perplexity and change. It is not too
late, perhaps, for the omen to be averted.

Sumner on Lafayette,
The New York Evening Rut prints the fol
lowing extract from Charles Sumner’s recent
lecture In that city, on Lafayette:
Mr. Sumner spoke of Lafayette as “ one who
early consecrated himself to human freedom,
and throughout along life became Its knight
errant, its hero, its apostle, its martyr—who
strove for it as no man in history ever strove
—who suffered for It as few have suf
fered. and whose protracted career, beginning
at a period when others are still at school, and
ending only at the tomb, where he tardily de
scended ; was conspicuous also ibr the purest
principle, the most steadfast integrity and the
loftiest courage, civil and military. *.
Mr. Sumner gave the following description
of Lagrange, the country bouse of Lafayette,
where he spent the last thirty years of his
life:—
“It was on a beautiful October day of the
last year—now only a little more a year
ago—that just before leaving France, in com
pany with a friend, I visited this most inter
esting scene. -You all know something of It
from books and pictures. It is-a most ven
erable and picturesque castle, with live round
towers, a moat, a drawbridge. Ivy c’ad walls, a
largo court-yard within, and the whole em
bosomed In trees, except on one side, where a
lawn spreads Us verdure. Everything is his
toric. The castle, in its origin, goes'hack to
the twelfth century. It was once tenanted by
the princes of the great house of Loraine.
The cannon of the field-marshals of the time
have left their traces on Its masonry. ' The ivy
which mantles so luxuriantly its gate and the
lower by its side, was planted by the great
English statesman, Charles Fox, on bis pil
grimage there daring the short-lived peace of
Amiens, in 1803. The park owes much of its
beauty to Lafayette bimscLC The situation of
the castle harmonizes with those retired habits
which sought shelter here from the storms of
fortune. It lies In a level district, forty-five
miles due cast from Paris, remote from and
highway; remote also from the railway, which
now traverses that region In a country filled
with orchards, smiling with fertility of all
kind*.
“The estate immediately about the castle
contains six hundred acres, which, in the time
of Lafayette, was increased by several outlying
farms. A well-filled library occupies the upper
room of one of the round towers, and in the
window overlooking the farm-yard still stands
the very desk at which Lafayette was In the
habit of sitting, and within reach the speaking
trumpet through which he was in the habit of
addressing his tanners from that very window,
aud on the desk the account books of the
farm, in his own handwriting, precisely as he
left them. The castle is now tenanted ‘by the
family of one of his grandchildren, who c sim
ple, cordial welcome of us. merely as Ameri
cans, gave token of their illustrious ancestor
no less tlihn those many memorials or the full
length portrait which adorned the walls.”
Mr. Sumner spoke ns follows of Lafayette’s
Imprisonment at Olmutz:
“Alone in his cell, with no object in view
but four walls, shut out from all knowledgcof
the world, shut out from all knowledge of his
family, who, on their part, could know noth
ing of him; never addressed by his name;
mentioned only by the number of his cell, 15:
cut off from all chance of self-destruction, by
being deprived of the use of a knife and fork
—such was now his lot. But never for one
moment did his soul bend in its firm resolves.
Immediately on going to prison, he took the
precaution to make an official declaration of
Ids principles, so that bo might not, in any rc
f'pcct, be confounded with fugitive royalists.
Letters now exist, some of them written at
the peril of his life—sometimes with lemon
juice, sometimes with a tooth-pick dipped
In chimney black mixed with vinegar—
where his beautiful soul is laid bare.
Confirming his joy that he suffers of that des
iK>tism which he‘had combatted, rather than
from the people he loved so well, he announces
his equal opposition to the committee of Ja
cobinism and the cabinets of the coalition. He
declares his firm conviction that amidst all the
cheeks of anarchy liberty will not perish
[Applause.] He remembers with a thrill the
anniversary of American Independence as that
day comes. [Applause.] Of his own declara
tion of the rights of man he says that if he
were alone In the universe he would not mis
take to maintain It He scorns the Idea of vin
dicating them at the expense of his character
and principles. [Applause.] But never, never
did any eoul rise to purer heights than when
from that dungeon he loft us this prison lega
cy, • That the sntblaction derived from a sin
gle act rendered to humanity more than out
weighs all the evil inflicted by oar enemies,
aad cvcnall the Ingratitude of the country.*
Then, going further, ho sends his thoughts
to those poor African slaves on the distant
plantation of Cayenne. In the wreck of his
great fortune he knew not what had become i
of tins plantation, and be * trusts that his wife
will take care that the Africans who cultivate
it do not lose their liberty.’ Search history,
and I know nothing more sublimely touching
than these simple words from that heavy bolt
ed dungeon. Thai noble woman, mated with
him in soul as in the marriage vow—and In all
history there are few women that can compare
with the wife ofLafayettc—knowing well his
wishes, had already sought to antieijmte them.
Hut, alas! in vain. The Tberty of those Afri
cans had already been cruelly confiscated with
lls ; state; and that confiscation was but syro
bo:h-.il of the proscription that now descended
upon his family and bis friends. In the mas*
quenide of blood which now ensned, the impu
tation of*Faycttcism* was equivalent to a de
cree of death; nor were tender women spared.
The sister, mother and grandmother of his
wife all perished in the same hour upon the
scaffold, and fell with a hundred others in a
promiscuous grave.
Ilia own wile was twice plunged In a dun
geon, and only escaped the same fate by the
timely overthrow of the tyrant Robespierre.
Their only son, George Washington Lafayette
[applause] had already, by her maternal care,
occn conveyed to his great namesake in Ameri
ca, who received and sheltered him at Mount
Vernon. [Applause.] At last, regaining her
freedom, this noble womau, with her two
youthful daughters, under the protection of
uu American passport, hurried across the con
tinent of Europe to Vienna, and threw herself
at the feet of the Emperor. To her prayers
for the relief of her husband, the despot replies
that his bauds arc tied ; but touched by devo
tion so womanly, to wifelikc, so heroic, he
yields so far a* to allow her, with her two
daughters, two share bis wretched captivity,
upon the single condition that upon once
rutcring the ’dungeon they were never
more to come out; and these terms were
accepted by that devoted family. [Applause.]
Vain now were all the efforts fo’rhl.- liberation.
Not Fox, not Cornwallis, not Washington,
could open those pi iaon doors. Lafayette was
declared to be not only the representative of
the French revolution, but of universal liber
ty, whose existence was dangerous to Europe
an government*. Private enterprise seemed
for a moment to be likely to cud his long con
finement. Upon the repeated application of
his physician, Lafayette was allowed occasion
al exercise in the open air, under a strict mil
itary escort. Two friends, who. for several
months had been watching for the opportuni
ty, communicated to him their plans; and,
with their assistance, after a desperate con
flict, he escaped, but only to be recaptured,
after a flight of twenty-seven miles, and
plunged into a still worse dungeon.
4 * But this enterprise, although unsuccessful,
is never heard without a thrill of gratitude to
wards those noble men who, taking their lives
iu their hands, thus braved the Austrian tyr
anny. Human nature seems more lair from
their example. All hope for his liberation was
now abaudoned. His friends, both in France
aud in America, were wrung with angnisb:
aud Washington, at his fireside in Mount Ver
non. shed tears for hU friend. But an inter
vention was at hand which would not he de
nied. It was the sword of Napoleon Boua
parte-p-[applause] —which, flashing acrocs the
A!]is from his Italian campaigns, broke open
the dungeon of Otmutz. The conqueror was
afterwards beard to declare, that among all the
concessions he extorted, there was nothing he
found it so difficult to obtain as that release.
But it was accomplished, and Lafayette, with
ills wife and daughters, leaving their dungeon
home, traversed Europe to Hamburg, where
try fouud shelter witli the American consul
• ;.th the American flag.” [Applause.]

at the height of worldly ambition, or plunged
iu the vaults of a dungeon, always true to the
same principles. Great he was indeed; not ns
an author, although he has written wliat we
arc all glad to read; not as an orator, olthongh
he spoke often and well; not as a soldier,
although always brave and often working
miracles of genius; not as a statesman, al
though versed in government and intuitively
perceiving the relations of men and nations';
not on these accounts is he great; but he Is
great os one of the world's benefactors, who
possessed the largest measure of that greatest
gift of God to man—the genius ofbencticeucc;
and great he is as an example; which, so long
as history endures, shall teach all—the author,
the orator, the soldier, thestatesman—all alike,
to labor, and if need be, to sutler for human
rights. The fame of such a character, bright
ening with the advance of civilization, can find
no limit, except iu earthly gratitude.—[Great
applause.]
Interesting from Japan.
[From the Washington Constitution, Dee. I.]
As unusual Interest Is felt in regard to the
prospect of commerce with Japan, and the im
pres.-Itm made in that country by its late em
bassy here, we are gratified at'the opportunitr
of publishing the subjoined dispatches on these
subjects from Mr. Harris, the United States
Minister to Veddo, to the Secretary of State:
HR. HARRIS TO THE SECRETART OP STATE.
[No. 22-3 Legation or the United States,
Yoddo, July 11.1860.
Sir : Our treaty with this country went into
effect on the 4th of J nly of last year; it cannot
be said that much commercial business was
transacted before the month of September last,
so that the actual transactions ore comprised
within a period of abont ten months.
The amount of exportable articles brought
for sale has far exceeded my expectations, and
although 1 have no official statements on
which to base my opinion, and am, therefore,
compelled to take secondary information as to
the aggregate of the export trade of this conn
try during the period named above, 1 believe
that I am quite within the amount when I
state the total to be five millions of dollars.
The principal articles exported were: Raw
silk,Booo biles; tea, 15,000 chests; vegetable
wax and oil to the value of half a million, and
mannffictores of silk, copper and lacquered
ware; considerable quantities of tobacco, pa
per, camphor, ffoux, peas, beans, edible sea
weed. Isinglass, Beche ie mer, and dried oys
ters and Umplcts. with various other articles,
have been shipped for the China market
Four vessels with cargoes have cleared for
ports in the United States; but this only rep
resents a portion of the American interests m
this country, as a large amount of American
capital and tonnage finds a profitable em
ployment in the trade withUhlna, end at Kan-
agawa American citizens form more than a
moiety of the foreign population.
The production of silk and tea can no doubt
be largely increased, as the Japanese admit
that they have not heretofore reeled all the
cocoons produced, nor picked all of the tea
grown. •.
The Japanese bate already learned the mail'
ner of preparing lea for a sea voyage, lam of
opinion that, wit bin a few years, the cholsest
tea known in the United 'States will be ot
Japanese production, os many of the sorts arc
superiortoany of the teas of China.
But little has been done as yet with Imports,
and the establishment of an extended trade
mast, of necessity, be the work of time. .To
a certain extent new wants must be created
among the masses, and, what U> of equal im
portance, they must discover that the labor
now expended by them In producing a given
article will, when direct ullo another employ
ment, produce In czehaLge either more than
they now obtain, or any article that is prefera
ble to their own.
Attention hfis beefi directed to the procur
ing goods of lengths, widths, colors and pat
terns suited to .Japanese taste; this I* on im
portant step in the right direction for Ameri
can manufactures. lam of opinion that the
heavy cottons known in commerce as drills.
Jean, sheetings, and skirtings, will be the
earliest in demand.
A careful review of the commercial opera
tions fur the lost ten months shows a satisfac
tory result, and if any ordinary decree of pru
dence in dealing with the Japanese!* observed
by the foreigners who come to this country, it
cannot be donbted that a large and beneficial
Intercourse can be securely established in
Japan, ahd that but a few years will bo requir
ed to secure t*o desirable a result.
I have the honor to be, very respectfully,
your obedient servant.
Townsend Harris.
To thcHonorable Lewis Cass.
Secretary of State, Washington.
Extraordinary Doable Elopement—
Two Men Uun Away with Each
Ollier’-* Wive*—The Free-Lovcr»Meet
aud have a General* Fight.
The Holmes County (Ohio) Farmer relates
an amusing incident in this very amusing
stylo:
On Tuesday of last week, while standing on
the platform of the depot building at Crest
line, wailing for the tram to start eastward, a
train arrived from the East. The first persons
we recognized getting from the train were Vi.
K. Scott and the wife of Levi L. Johnson, of
Marlboro Stark county. They readily recog
nized us. come up to where we were, and after
the usual salutations, inquired when a train
would leave for Bellcfcntaine. At this mo
ment Mr. Johnson and the wife of Scott also
unexpectedly made their appearance. The wo
men instantly recognized each other, and with
out uttering a word, “pitched into” one of thrt
liveliest free fights we luve ever been called
upon to witness. The way the ribbons, bon
nets, collars and fancy fixings flew was refresh
ing to milliners and montua makers. This
excited Scott and Johnson, aud they were so
sorely grieved at each other for running away
with their respective wives that they went into
pugilistic exercise with a hearty good will. The
claret lleff delightfully, the store clothes were
rutfied, and the swearing wcutuut in fine style.
A gaeat many persons were gathered around,
but liu one caring much which of the laities
whipped, they encouraged the fight and
laughed at the sport. \V idle the fights were
progressing. Constable Smith Hupped the
fighting and took the parties before the Mayor,
and his Honor fined each of them $5 and costs
for breaking the peace.
Scott and Mrs. Johnson, who have for some
time been suspected of being guilty of licen
tious intrigues, bad planned an elopement,
and strange to say, Johnson, who it is sup
|*oscd lias not resisted the approaches of Mrs.
Scott, as did Joseph those of Potiphar’s wife,
had also planned an elopement, to be carried
out on the same day with the other parties.
Both guilty couple hail clandestinely clipped
off from Marlboro’ on the same day; one par
ty took the cars at Alliance, and the other got
on the same train, though iu a different car, at
Louisville Station. Neither cooplc suspected
the other until they met at Crestline, when the
feelings they enjoyed may bo imagined but
cannot be described on paper.
After paying their line.-, which satisfied them
that fighting was an unprofitable way of set
tling lue difficulty, they indulged In the appli
cation of a goodly number of bard words and
names to each other, and finally separated—
Scott and Mrs. Johnson taking the B. oc L.
Railroad, and Johnson and Mrs. Scott the P.,
Ft. W. &C. Railroad. Since then nothing has
been heard of their journeying*.
