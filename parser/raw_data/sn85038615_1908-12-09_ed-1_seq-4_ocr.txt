t ?- Senate and then In the House.
The reading of the message began
In the Senate nt 13:16 nnd In the House
? few minutes later. The galleries of
both houses were well tilled, and al?
most all of the .'eats of Senators nnd
members were occupied by their own?

printed copies of the message, which
proved) to bn a document of forty-four |
printed pages, with an elaborate j li?
re ndifc containing numerous llluitrn
tlons showing the results of tho work
Of the forestry bureau. Senator! and
members gave comparatively little at?

Justice and wrong to the corporations.
The opposition to government con?
trol of these great corporations makes
Its most effective effort in the shape
of an appeal to tho old doctrine of
States' rights. Of course there ar-j
man? sincere men -who now believe. In
unrestricted Individualism in business,
j'isr as there were formerly mam- sin-ic
cere men who believed In slavery?
that is. In tho unrestricted right of an
Individual to own another individual.
These nien do not by themselves have
great weight however Thi effective
fight against adequate government con
trol and supervision of Individual, nnti
especially of corporate, wealth engaged
in Interstate business lr. chiefly don*
under '-over, and especially under cover
of an appeal to Btatea' rights.
To abandon the effort ror national
control means to Hbandon the effort for
all adequate control and yot. to render
likely continual bursts of action by
State Legislatures, which cannot
achieve the purpose sought for, but
which can do a great deal of damage to
the corporation without conferring any
real benefit on the public.
I believe that the more farsightecr
corporations are themselves coming to
recognize tho unwisdom of the violent
hostility they have displayed during
tho last few years to regulation an-.l
control bv tho national government of
combinations engaged in ' interstate
business. The truth Is that we who
believe In this movement of a&serting
and exorcising a genuine control, in
the puhllo interest, over these great
corporations have to contend against
two sets of enemies, who. though nom?
inally opposed to one another, are rcally
allies In preventing a proper solution
of tho problem. There are, first, tho
big corporation men and the extreme
individualists among businessmen, who
genuinely believe In utterly unregulat?
ed business?that Is, in the reign of
plutocracy; and, second, the men who.
bring blind to the economic movements
of the day. believe In a movement of
repression rather than of regulation of
corporations, and who denounce both
tho power of tho railroads und the ex?
ercise of the Federal power which alone
can really control the railroads.
We do not for a moment believe that
the problem will be solved by any short
and easy method. Tha solution will
come only by pressing various concur?
rent remedies, Some of these remedies
must lie outside the domain of all
government. Some must He outside
the domain of the Federal government.
But there Is legislation which the Fed?
eral government alone can enact and
which Is absolutely vital in order to
securo the attainment of our purpose.
Labor.
As far as possible I hope to see a
frank recognition of the advantages
conferred by machinery, organization
and division of labor, accompanied by
an effort to bring about a larger sharo
In the ownership by wageworkor of
railway, mill and factory.
Postal savings'banks will make it
easy for the poorest to keep their .sav?
ings in absolute safety. The regulation
of the national highways must bo such
that they shall serve nil people with
equal justice. Corporate finances must
bo supervised so as to make it far saf?
er than at present for the man of smuii
means to Invest his money in stocks.
There muBt be prohibition of child
labor-, diminution of woman labor,
shortening of hours of all mechanical
labor; stock watering should bo pro?
hibited, and stock gambling so far as is
possible discouraged. There should bo
a. progressive inheritance tax on largo
fortunes. Industrial education tjhould
be encouraged. As far as possible wo
Bhould lighten the burden of taxation
on the small man.
Protection for Wage-workers.
There Is one matter with which the
Congress should deal with at this session
There should no longer be any palter?
ing with the question of taking cam
of tho wageworkera who under our
present industrial system, become hill?
ed, crippled, or worn out as part of the
regular incidents of a given business.
The majority of wageworkers must
vg their rights secured for them by
State action; but the national govern?
ment should legislate in thoroughgo?
ing and far-reaching fashion not only
for all employes of tAe national gov?
ernment, but for all persona engaged
in Interstate commerce
Our present, system, or rather no
system, works dreadfully wrong, und
I Is of benefit to only one class of poo
I pie?the lawyers. When a workman
| Is injured what lie needs is not an ex
j pensive and doubtful lawsuit, but the
\ certainty of relief through immediate
' administrative action.
The Congress should without further
; delay pass a model employers' liability
I law for the District of Columbia.
J renew my recommendation niado In
! u previous message that half-holidays
I he granted during summer to n]\ wage
| workers in government employ.
I also renew my recommendation
that the principle of tho eight-hour
day should as rapidly and an far as
practicable be extended to the entire
work being carried on by tho govern
. uient; tho present law should be
. amended to embrace contracts on those.

t seems to exclude.
i In- Conrtx.
teslly urge upon the Cou
y of Increasing the totally
ilurles now given to our
gross me
lnadeq.ua t
judges.
It is earnestly to bo desired that
some method should be dovtsed for
doing away with the long delays whlcn
now obtain In the administration of
justice, and which operate with pecu?
liar severity against persona of small
means, and favor only the very crimi?
nals whom It Is most desirable 'o
punish. Those long delays in tho tlnal
decisions of cases make In the ae-gre
gate a crying evil; and a remedy should
bo devised.
At tha last election certain leaders
of organised labor made a violent and
sweeping attack upon the entire Ju?
diciary of the country, an attack
touched in uuch terms as to Include
the most upright, honest and bron.cl
mJnded judges, no less than those of
narrower mind and more restricted
outlook. It was the kind of utta-Vk
udmirably fitted to prevent any huc
cossful attempt to reform abuses of
the judiciary, because It gava the
] champions of the unjust judge their
eagerly desired opportunity to shift
-their ground into a championship of

condemned; while tho right to carry
3ii a business was explicitly taken oui
'rorti under that protection which tht
aw throws over property. Tho de
nand was made tout there should be
.rial by jury in contempt ruses, thereby
nost seriously Impairing the authority
if tho courts'. Ail this represented n
:<)Urso of jmllcy which, If curried out
.vuuld mean the i nthronement of cliisf
Ji'ivllege in Its crudest and most brutal
form, and the destruction Of ono ol
'.ho most essential functions of the
military In all civilized land.-.
The Wfign-workors, tho worklngmen,
-lio laboring men ot tho country, by
he way In which I hey repudiated the
.ffort to got Ihcni to enst. their votes
n response to an appeal to class ba?
red, h.-ii-o nniphaslzed their sound pu
rlotism and ,mii>'i'lcanism.
But the extreme reactionaries, the
icrsons who blind themselvnB to tho
.vrongs now ami then committed by
ha courts on laboring men, should also
blnk seriously as to want such a
novoment as this portends. The
ludges who have shown themselves
Lblo nnd willing effectively to check
he dishonest nctH'ity of the very rich
nan who works Iniquity by the mls
nanagement of corporations, who have
ihown themselves alort to do Justice

vlth the needs of tho nfciss of our peo
ilo, so that the dweller in tho tenement
louses, the man who practices u dan
ccrous trade, the man who is crushed
>y excessive hours of labor, feel that
heir needs aro understood by th;
?ourts?those Judges are tho real bul
vark of tho courts.
Courts are Jeopardized primarily by
he action of those Federal and State
udges who show inability or miwlll
ugness to put n stop to tho wrong
lolug of very rich men under modern
ridustrlal conditions, and Inability or
inwilllngness to give relief to men
>f small means or wage-workera who
re crushed down by these modern l;i
lustrlal condition;*; who, in other
cords, fall to understand and appiv
ho needed remedies for the new
trrongs produced by the now and hlgh
y complex social and Industrial clv
lizatlon which h.is grown up In the
h*1 hslf centnrj .
It in desirable that the legislative
n.dy should possess, nnd whcrcvei
iccessarv exercise, the power to' de
ermlne 'whether In a given case em
'lOyers and employes are not on an
qual footing, so that tho necessities
>f the latter compel them to submit to
ucli exactions bs to hours and condi
ions of labor as unduly to tax their
trength; and only mischief can result
vhen such determination is upset on
he ground that there must bo no "in
erferonce with Ihe liberty to con
ract"?often a merely academic "11
lerty," the exercise of which Is tho no?
tation of real liberty.
There Is also, I think, ground for the
iflllcf that substantial Injustice i3
?ften suffered by employes* In conse
luenco of tho custom of courts issuing
emporary injunctions without notice
o thern, and punishing them for con
empt of court In Instances where, us
matter of fact, they have no knowl
dge of any proceedinq!*. Outside of
.rganlzed labor there Is a widespread
eellng that this system often works
rreat injustice to wage-workers when
heir efforts to better their working
ondjtlon result In Industrial disputes.
t temporary injunction procured ex
i.arte may, as a matter of fact, have
.11 the effect of a permanent Injunc
lon In causing disaster to the wage
vorkers' side in Mich a dispute. Or
ranlzed Iaber Is chafing uneler the un
ust restraint which comes from re
leated resort to this plan of pro
edure, Its discontent has been un
visely expressed, and often Improperly
impressed, but there is a sound baMj
or It, and the orderly and law-abidlnR
leople of a community would be In a
ar stronger position for upholding the
:ourts If the undoubtedly existing
ibuses could be provided against.
Such proposals as those mentioned
ibove as advocated by the extreme
abor leaders contain the vital error
if being class legislation of the most
iffenstve kind, and even If enacted into
aw, I believe that tho law would rlght
y be held unconstitutional. Moreover,
he labor people are themselves now
leglnnlng to invoke tho use of the
>ower of injunction.
For many of tha shortcomings ol
ustice In our country our people as
i whole aro themselves to blame, and
he judges and Juries merely hear their
ihare together with the public as n
vholo. It Is discreditable to US as a
leople that there should be difficulty
n convicting murderers, or in bring
nrr. to Justice men who as public ser
?ants have been guilty ot corruption,
a- who have profited by tho corruption
if public servants.
The chief breakdown Is In dealing
vlth the new relations that arise from
he mutualism, tho Interdependence oi
iur time. Every new social relatlor
;eset8 a new type of wrongdoing?of
dn, to use an old-fashioned word?ant
nany years always elapse' before so
?letv is able to turn this sin into crime
vhleh can be effectively punished at
aw. During tho lifetime of the oldoi
nen now alive tho social relations have
ihanged far moro rapidly than In th<
u-ecedlng two centuries. The lm
nense growth of corporations, of busi?
ness done by associations, and the ex
:remo strain and pressure of moderr
ife, have produced conditions whicl
under the public confused U3 to whe
its really elangerous foes are; ane
imong the public servants who havi
tot onlv shared this confusion, but bj

lias been shown In dealing with cor

only towards corporations, but toward;

Issues Of securities and ltn con'l.nit
consolidation with allied undertakings,
finally becomes an lrintrumcni so com*
pinx an iii contain a greater number
of eiotnents that, under various judicial
decisions, lend themselves to fraud find
oppression than any device yet evolved
in tin. human brain. Corporations are
necessary Instruments of modern httsl*
noSs. They have been permitted to
become a menace largely because tho
governmental representatives of tho
people have worked rlowlv In provid?
ing tor adequate control over them.
Tho chief Offender In any given case
may bo an executive, a Legislature or
n judge. Every executive head who
advises violent. Instead of gradual, ac?
tion, or who advocates Ill-considered
and sweeping measures of reform
(especially If they nro tainted with
vindlctlvenea.i nnd disregard for the
rights of Iho minority) Is particularly
blameworthy. The several Legislatures
are responsible for the fact that our
laws are Often prepared tvlth slovenly
Haste nnd luck of consideration. More?
over, they are often prepared and still
more frequently amended during pas?
sage nt tho suggestion of tho very
parties against whom they arc after?
wards enforced.
Ileal damage has been done by the
manifold and conflicting. Interpreta?
tions ot tho Interstate commerce law.
Control over the great Corporations
doing Interstate business can ho effec?
tive only IT It Is vested with full power
in nn administrative department) a
branch of the Federal executive, car?
rying out n Federal law; It can never
bo effective If n divided responsibility
la left In both the States and tho na?
tion; it can never bo effective If left
In the hands of the courts to bo de?
cided by law-suits.
Forests,
If there 1s any one duty which more
than any other we owe It to our chil?
dren and our children's children to
perform at once, It Is to FaVn the
forests of this country, for they con?
stitute the first and most Important
element In tho conservation of tho nat?
ural resources of tho country.
Short-sighted persons,, or persons
blinded to tho future by desire to
make money In every way out of the
present, sometimes speak as If no great
damage would bo done by the reckless
destruction of our forests. It Is dlttl
cult to have patience with the argu?
ments of these" persons. Thanks to
our own recklessness In tho use of
our splendid forests, we have already
crossed the verge of a timber famine in
this country, and no measures that we
now take can, at least for many years,
undo tho mischief that has already
been done. But we can prevent fur?
ther mischief being done; and it would
bo in tho highest degree reprehensible
to let any consideration of temporary
convenience or temporary cost h I
fere with such action, especially as re?
gards the national foretts, which the
nation can now, nt this very moment,
control.
iniund Waterways.
Action should bo begun forthwith
during the present session of tho Con?
gress for the Improvement, of our In?
land waterway-3?action which will re?
sult In giving us not only navigable
but navigated rivers. Wo have spent
hundreds of millions of dollars upon
these waterways, yet the traffic on
nearly all .of them Is steadily declin?
ing. This condition Is the direct re?
sult of the absence of any comprehen?
sive and far-seeing plan of waterway
Improvement. Obviously we cannot
continue thus to oxpend the revenues
of the government without return. It
Is poor business to spend money for
inland navigation unless we get It.
Inquiry Into the condition of the
Mississippi and Its principal tributaries
reveals very many instances of the
utter wasto caused by the methods
which have hitherto obtained for tha
so-called "Improvement" of navigation.
VmiIihimI Pnrk*.
I urge that all our national parks
adjacent to national forests be placed
completely -under the control of the
forest service of the Agricultural De?
partment, Instead of leaving them as
they now are, under the Interior De?
partment, and policed by thn army.
Poatnl Having* Bnnkii.
I again renew my recommendation
for postal savings banks, for deposit?
ing savings with the necurlty of the
government behind them. The object
Is to encourage thrift and economy In
the wage-earner and person of mod?
erate means.
Parcel Post.
In rny last annual message I com?
mended the Postmaster-General's re?
commendation for an extension of the
parcel post on tha rural routes. Tho
establishment of a local parcel post on
rural routes would be to tha mutual
benefit of the farmer and the country
storekeeper, and It Is desirable that
the routes, serving more than 15,000,000
people, should be utilized to the fullest
practicable extent.
Education,
Tho share that tho national govern?
ment should take In the broad w.ork
of education has not received the at?
tention and the care it rightly deserves*.
The Immediate responsibility for the
support and Improvement of our edu?
cational systems and institutions rests
and should always rest with the peoples
of the several States acting through
their State and local governments, but
the nation has an opportunity In edu?
cational work which must not he lost
and a duty which should no longer be
neglected.
Census.
I strongly urge that the request of
tho Director of the Census In connec?
tion with the decennial work so soon
to be hegun bo complied with, and that
the appointments to the census force
be placed under the civil service law,
waiving the geographical requirements
ns requested by tho Director of the
Census. The supervisors and enum?
erators should not be appointed under
the civil service law. for the reasons
given by the director.
Redistribution of Bureaus.
It is highly advisable that thero
should be Intelligent action on the
part of the nation on tho question of
preserving tho health of the countrv.
Public Health.
The dangers to public health from
food adulteration and from many other
sources, such as tho menace to the
physical, mental and moral develop?
ment of children from child labor,
should bo mot and overcome.
I recommend that legislation be en?
acted placing under the Jurisdiction ot
tho Department of Commerce and La?
bor tho Government Printing Office.

Important Announcemen
To Prospective Piano Buyers
Concerning Our
Reorganization Sale!
After January 1 st the business which has
heretofore been conducted under the name
of The Cable Company will be known as thes
Cable Piano Company
which, instead of being a branch house, will
be a distinct corporation organized under
the laws of this State.
We shall open the reorganized business
with an entirely new line of Pianos from the
factories of The Cable Company, Chicago,
and the Mason & Hamlin Company, Boston.
To make room for these instruments we wish to dispose
of much of our present stock. We have therefore marked
many of our instruments at largely reduced prices.
These are not shop-worn or damaged instruments.
They are our regular stock and we give our -written guar?
antee to every buyer.
Of course we have a number of used instruments taken
in exchange, and these are also offered at reductions.
What we wish to emphasize, however, is the opportu?
nity presented to obtain a new piano of standard make at
a bargain figure.
This is an exceptional chance to-secure
Pianos of high merit at money-saving
figures. Every prospective purchaser
should at least call and inspect these
offerings.
You Can Buy on Easy Terms
You need not pay the full price down.
Terms will be arranged for monthly pay?
ments and will make immediate delivery.

J. G. CORLEY, General Manager.
Zealand, and In all tha States of Bouth
America, tho battle- licet haw been re?
ceived on its practice voyage around
tho world. The American government
can not too strongly express Its ap?
preciation of the abounding and gen?
erous hospitality Miown our ships in
every port they vlFited.
The Army,
As regards tho army, I call attention
to the fact that, while our junior offi?
cers and enlisted men stand very high,
the present ny-stom of promotion by
seniority results In bringing Into the
higher grades many men of medloc.-e
capacity who have but a short time to
serve. No man should regard It OH
his vested right to rise to the highest
rank in the army any more than In any
other profession.
The cavalry arm should bo reorgan?
ized upon modern lines. This is an arm
In which It Is peculiarly necessary that
the field officers should not be old. At
present both Infantry and artillery are
too few In number for our needs. Espe?
cial attention should bo paid to de?
velopment oi tho machine gun. A ?en
eral service corps should be establish?
ed. As things aro now, tho average
soldier has far too much labor of a
non-military character to perform.
National Guard. ,
Now that tho organized militia, tho
national guard, has been Incorporated
With tho army as a part of the national
forces, It behooves the government to
do every reasonable thing in its power
to perfect Its efficiency. It, should be
assisted In Its Instruction and other?
wise aided more liberally than here?
tofore.
There should be legislation to pro
Vide a complete plan for organising
the great body of volunteers behind
the regular army and national guard
?when war has come. Congressional
assistance should bo given those who
are endeavoring to promote riflo prac?
tice, so that our men, in the services
or out of them, may know how to uso
the riflo.
The Navy. *
I approve tho recommendations of
the general board for the increase of
the navy, calling -especial attention to
the need of additional destroyers and
colliers, and, above all, of the four
battleships. It is desirable to complete
as soon as possible a squadron, of eight
battleships of the best existing *yP?A.
I moBt earnestly recommend that the
general board be by law turned Into a
general staff. There Is literally no
excuse whatever for continuing the
present bureau organization of the
navy. Tho navy should be treated as
a purely military organization, and
everything should be subordinated to
the one object of securing military
affleleiicy. Such military efficiency can
only be guaranteed In time of war u
there is the most thorough previous
preparation in time of peace^?a prepa?
ration, I may add, which will in all
probability prevent any need of war.
The secretary must be supreme, and
he should have as his offloial advisers
a body of line officers, who should
themselves have the power to pass
upon and co-ordinate all the work and
all tho proposals of tl e several bureaus.
A system of promotion by merit, either
by selection or by exclusion, or by both
processes, should be introduced, it is
c\a. & ?x? o 'jet. x ^k..
Bear, the ^lha Kind ^m lla>a Alwa?s B^1
out of the Question, If the present
principle of promotion by mere seni?
ority Is kept, to expect to get the best
results from the higher officers. Our
men come toe old, and stay for too
short a time m tnc nigh comraan.l
positions.
Two hospital ships should be pro?
vided. The actual experience of the
hospital <ihip with tho flc-et In the
Pacific baa shown the invaluable work
which such a ship docs, and has also
proved that it Is w<j1I to have It kept
under tho command of a medical offi?
cer.
Nothing better for tho navy from
everv standpoint hss ever occurred
than the cruise of tho hattle fleet
around the world. The Improvement
of the chips In every way has been
extraordinary, nnd they have gained
. far more experience In battle tactics
I than they would have Rained if the?
had stayed In the Atlantic waters.
