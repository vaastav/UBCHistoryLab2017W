We suppose Ivy this time 'Pom Reeil lias
waited upon the President and an
noun^-d his renames to do business at
the old stand.
A one-pupil school, and that pupi' in
attendance but twice in three weeks, is
the report of a public school teacher in
Oneida, N. Y. "Sinecure" no longer
lacks a definition.
At a recent bicycle exhibit in England
all American wheels were barred. There
is but ono conclusion to bo drawn from
this, and that is that our manufacturers
are making a superior wheel. The time
when Americans had tc send to Europe
for what was best in mechanical pro?
ducts is long since past, and tc-day, in
cutlerv, fire-arms, watches, and in fact
into whatever human skill and brain
mechanism enters, Auitrica is an easy
first nmong the nations of the'worl;!.
The announcement by the students of
the University of Virginia for a called
meeting to reorganize the movement put
on foot last commencement, in order that
plans may be devised for a Poe memorial,
will be noted with plcnsurt; by tho
alumni ot that institution. Poe is ensily
her most distinguished alumnus, and it is
almost past belief that the University
has not long ugo taken some steps to
commeniorate.eitlier in architecture or in
marble, the goo-like genius of her alum?
nus, whose poetic lire, extinguished all
too soon, burned with a brilliancy that
has been approached by few and sur?
passed by none.
With Pnris for a radial point, all
France for the past week has been in a
state^of frenzied excitement,such ns only
^Frenchmen can rise to, over the Dreyfus
case. It really begins to '.nok'as though
the youug oOicer has been the victim of a
conspiracy of the foulest sort.and already
from being a by-word and a reproach
among men, ho is fast becoming a [popu?
lar idol. The circle of sympathy has
widened until it has even touched Amer?
ican shores, a branch of tho National Ba
varian Union in Baltimore bavin e just
completed an organization for the pur?
pose of attesting their belief in his inno?
cence and pledging him their aid in every
way possible to secure him justice.
Should it really turn out that Dreyfus is'
innocent, li^s return will lie given an ova?
tion in Paris, such no has never been wit?
nessed since the tin CS of Napoleon.
Amongst people of so volatile a tempera?
ment who can tell how high, politically,
such a wave of popular enthusiasm might
lift, him? France, her enthusiasm once
aroused, never does things in a half way
manner.
As was to be expected,the criticisms oi
the President's message by the press of
the countiy Is favorable or adverse, ac?
cording to the political standpoint of the
paper. It. is. however, noticeable that
not even the stauchest organs of the Re?
publican p'irty are wildly enthusiastic
over it. Even a superficial reading of it
will convince one that the message lacks
strength and firmness, and all the ques?
tions of great moment, the currency
question perhaps excepted, are treated
witli indecision, no policy save a half?
hearted and temporising one being out?
lined on any given subject. The message'
itself, so far as its English is concerned,
is remarkal ly terse and clear, reminding
one very much in this respect of his pred?
ecessor, whose messages were always
models ?.f English composition. That
Wall street is jubilant over the message
and that stocks took an upward leap by
reason of it, is no reason why the coun?
try or. huge should feel the sr.me spirit of
elation. In speculative circles Mr. Mc?
Kinley'? midget will be hailed :e n grand
success.
The Scientific American has quite a
lengthy article, witli cuts, illustrating
the school fire drill as practiced iu the
Cambridge,Mass.,manual school for boys.
It seems that some sort of systematic
drill or exeicise must be provided now
in all large schools, as a sort of escape
valve for youthful eO'ervesence, and here,

instead of "theatrical soldiers," they are
making practical firemen cf their pupils;
not that they expect, of course, to make
actual firemen of their hoys, hut to givu
them coolness, courage .Mill promptness
in emergencies, in all of which things the
modern methods of fighting lire are suffi?
ciently scientific to produce good disci?
plinary results. It strikes us that there
would he an element of dash and vim
about ibis which would appeal to the ar?
dor of boys and at the same time implant
in them :i sense of responsibility; but we
very much doubt whether the same
habits of ohe'Mence to. sommonfls, im?
provement of carriage, and promptness
of response are to hi obtained from any
lire drill that would be equal to the mil
tary tactics recognized as so helpful an
adjunct to general school training.
SHIVERING STJHOOL DHILDREN.
Prcf. Sbeppe, 'principal' of the Com?
merce street school, in Ins reply in yes?
terday's Times to the card of Col. Lock
ett, calling attention to the fact that tho
children of the public schools are forcod
to stand on the streets until the doors
are opened, durl.lg tdl sorts of] weather,
shows t hat he isactingstrictly within the
limits ot school regulations. The q"
tion, however, is whether those wdio
framed these rulesand regulations cannot
devise some p'an by which such a neces?
sity can be avoided. We know that there
are many difficulties in the way of 'his.
Until the teachers are in their rooms, It
would not do to let the children pour
pell-mell into them. Then, again, many
of cur public school children come from
homes that are rarely comfortable,and to
fix the hour at which they are allowed to
assemble in school, at an earlier one,
would be to see these same children still
ahead of time, standing shivering ou the '
streets. To require the teachers to be
present at an earlier hour t'jan they now
are would be to impose additional work
upon.those who already have as much as
they can do. These are some of the diffi?
culties iu the way; but at the same time,
to compel children who may arrive at
school before the hour of opening, whet her
it be purposely or .inadverteutly,? to ie
main outside in the rain or snow, or even
Ofi a clear but cold day, is certainly not
right. As a rule, these early comers will
be found to be from the homes of our
pooler people, and to their thinly clad
bodies the unnecessary exposure of even
' five minutes" in a raw east wicd may
mean u spell of sickness. This is a mat?
ter wo have frequently heard bitterly
complained of, and iu one instance,
whether correct or not, a case of pneu?
monia was charged directly to this cause.
In lieu of anything better, we would
oiler the following suggestion, applicable
at least to the Commerce street school,
which Is steam neated. The janitor is
necessarily on the premises at an early
hour. Let the lower rooms bo kept
locked uutll the teachers arrive aud in?
struct ihe janitor to tdlow tne children
who may come before that time,the priv?
ilege of the balls, which are usually com?
fortable, and which are large enough to
accommodate such as come before the ar?
rival of the teachers. Whether such a
plan could be adopted at the other build?
ings we do not know. The whole ques?
tion is a much vexed one, and has always
given tho same trouble iu al' our larger
cltles.but we do not know what expedient
they adopt to remedy it.

SET A THIEF TO < 'A TCI I A THIEF.
President Diaz, of Mexico, is credited
with tho invention of an ingenious
method of ridding the country of bandits,
iuclud'ug train rol bers, which is work?
ing like a char-*'. A desperado of more
thun common intelligence was captured
about, two years ago. and the President
interviewt] bun in prison several times.
The bandit, told him t hat want of occupa?
tion was at thefoot ol , the whole, trouble.
The President, said: "I will test you.
You shall be liberated,and I will appoint
you chief of police in your native district.
You aie to guard all trains, [und protect,
passengers at the way stations. You can
appoint your own suborainatea from
your to)lowers. You will be rewarded for
maintaining good order ln"yonr district,
and held responsible for all 'lawless acts
by whomsoever committed."
There has not been a robbery In that
district (which was formerly a dn.tgerous
one for ionrists to pass throughJ since
that appoint incut ivas made. The system
has been extended, and now the solitary
uniformed policeman on tin platform of
nearly every small station iu .Mexico is
an ex robber. l'e is known.and respected
as a superior person by the pecna and
loafers, who know thai ho will permit no
petty thieving. He. in turn, knows thai
he is d'-scly watched by a superior officer
who is in the employ of the chief ix
bandit.

A BRUTAL WIFE-MURDERER.
In Greensboro Saturday Night?A Strong
Talk of Lynching.
The ftllcwing will uc dcubt interest
fronds cf the murderer in Koanoke.
Winston Sentinel: One of the most hor
l ible and cold blooded murders ever per?
petrated in this S{ate was that at Greens?
boro Saturday evening when Sonly Ryan,
a trilling fugitive from justice, shot and
killed h's wife because she hail refused to
turu over to him $11, *vhich she had just
collected from her boarders.
Mrs. Ryan was passing noross the
street from her residence to a grocery
store to pay a bill when'the brute came
suddenly upon her, seized her throat ami
demanded the money. Her refusal caused
fclm to draw a pistol and (ire two balls
into her body. Tho itrst entered her head
and the other the breast. Death was al
mort instantaneous. Not satisfied by
this dastardly deed,the fiend turned upon
Iiis daughter, who was rushing to her
mother's rescue,and would have shot her
but for tho appearance of several men
running to tho scene. The wife-murderer
disappeared doIV11 an alley.
Still thirsting foi blood he went to
Frazier's hardware store and attempted
to shoot County Treasurer liodgen,
against whom he had ,'a grudge. When
captured he said tie had attempted to
shoot himself and showed a print of the
pistol muzzle on his temple. '1 he pistol,
he said, failed to fire.
A brother of the dead wife came upon
the oflicers witli their prisotier and would
have killed hin with a shotgun but lor
the intervention ol bysl Inders. There is
much indignation among Greensboro cit?
izens and theie is talk of a lyucliiuu.

HOW TO PREVENT PNEUMONIA.
. At this time of the year a cob' is very
easily contracted, and if left to run its
course without the aid of some reliable
cough medicine is liable to result, in that
dread disease, pneumonia. We know of
no better remedy to cure a cough or cold
than Chamberlain's Cough Remedy. We
have use ii quite extensively ami it has
always given ent ire satisfaction. -Olngah,
Ind. Ter., Chief
This is the only remedy tint is known
to he a certain preventive of pneumonia.
Among the many thousands who have
used it for colds and In grippe, we have
never yet learned of a single case having
resulted in pneumonia. Persons who
have weak lungs or have reason to fear an
attack of pneumonia should keep the
remedy al hand. The 25 and 60 cent, slze.s

THE PENSION OCTOPUS.
Swallows Nearly One-Half of the
Federal Revenue.
From tiu* Now York Sun: For tins first
time since tlie jreiisiim appropriations be?
gun to assume enormous proportions it
seems certalu that thu subject win re?
ceive proper and earnest attention from
Congress. It begins to lie sein tii.it a
pcusivti list which thirty t wo years alter
the close of the war clo.-ely approximates
half the total numb"r of three-year en?
listments, and which is still rapidly
growing, demands serious conslderation.
It is a case .vhere the assistanco is needed
of the veterans who sprang to arms iu
1801, before pensions or bounties were
talked ol or thought of. Their aid is a
patriotic duty, now as ihe.i. They owe
it to themselves to frown upon unworthy
pent-loners on the rolls and unworthy up
plica ii ts.
'1 he pension roll now far exceeds the
membership of all the patriotic societies
ol veterans which the war created: iu
fact, is considerably mure than double
the membership of all of them?Grand
Army of the Republic, Union Veteran
Legion. Union Veterans' Union. Military
Order of the Loyal Legion, Society of the
Army of the Potomac, Society of the
Army of the James, Soc ety of the Army
ol the Tennessee, Society of the Army of
West Virginia, and the Society of tho
Army ot the Cumberland.
Turning from the contemplation of
numbers to the consideration of the cost,
it appears that next year's expenditures
for pensions will require mort than half
the ye uly icceipts as calculated upon
those of the month just closed. Tho
present estimate la that.the roll will cost
$1.10,000,000. To put the matter in stil!
more striking form, ]this annual outlay
will iii|tiiie $32,000,000 more than the
total receipts Irom customs, estimated
upon those of the month of November
last as an avenge. If this annual ex?
pense be compared with the internal rev?
enue receipts estimated o-' the same
basis, it. is found that, the entire reveuue
from this source, with the exception of
?12.000,000, wiil be required to pay the
pension roll.
Loosed at iu another shape: if a line
could he forme' equal in length to one
made up of all the_three-yenr veterans of
the war and every other man should bo
advanced a pace to' the front, the num?
bers in either line would then mit slightly
exceed those ou the pension roll, ami
mote than every other dollar or the gov?
ernment revenue would be required to
pay it.
More st art line stiii does the magnitude
of t'ds pens on payment appear when its
amount Is compared with the items of
aunnul appropriations. These in round
numbers were'the appropriations for the
current fiscal yeai:
Legislative, ?7 713,000; "executive
prop! r. $200 000; Stute. $2.109.000; Treas?
ury, $32,200,000; war. $?8,073.000; navy,
$3:1,554.000; postofbee, $939,000; interior
except pensions, $15,012,000: agriculture,
$3.1e8.000; jns'ice, $0,120.000; labor.
$174,000: pensions. $l4i.204p900; total,
$302,585,000; totals without pension*.
$101,321.000; penfeious for next yenr,$130,
000,(100.
It will bo seen Irom these 'figures that
if tleooi of Cotieres--,tbe printing olbce,
the library and the botanic igarden. ex?
pressed in ihe item legislative, and the
i?giiculturnl department be taken out of
the above,column the pensions lor next
year will rqutl the tctal cost of the re?
maining government service. That is to
say. the cost of pensions will, with thi
small except ions noted, 'equal the entire
salary list of the Government iu Wash?
ington nnd throughout the country, the
expenses of hII the departments, includ?
ing the whole judicial system, the cost of
the army and navy, postoffice deficien?
cies, pUblic buildings, fortifications, and
ships, livers and harbors,the department
? if labor, and the whole expense of the
White House and its salaries. A long
array ol prominent items, such as those
for the coast survey, the life-saving ser?
vice, the light house system, the Indian
service, the general land oflice, the Ma?
li lie Hospital service, the national Sol- ?
liters' Homes, the customs service, which i
are included in the above figures, might
be added t,? still further emphasize the J
point under ci moderation.
Such compaiisons as these have at last 1
attracted the attention which they do j
serve, and Washington upon the eve of |
tho opening of Congress in full ?u ta'k
based upon such presentation of the .sub?
ject.
Pension reform has been a question
which for years has been forcing Itself
upon the attention of Congressmen. It I
has been put aside from year to y ?ar be- 1
cause, from motives which are easily un- I
derstood, autl which have innen to com- j
mend them, there was a general dispnst- |
lion to provide for the growing' burden
rather than seem ever, to be turning the i
cold shoulder to veterans. Hut with a
pensiou expenditure re (Hiring more than |
half ti.e present yearly revenues, and at
a time when these revenues, :ir; falling
many millions below the total annual ex?
penditures, the question becomes one 'n
volving nut only justice to the old sol?
dier, but fairness to the rest of the nu
l ion.
There is no dissent worth consideration
from the proposition thit if $150,000,000
is fairly due to soldiers, or those who
liav been or are dependent upon them on
account of disabilities incurred 'in tho
service, every cent of it should be
promptly paid. Further than this there
Is a goueral assent to t ic proposition that
the government owes to all who weie' Ms
nbled and impoverished by the casualties
of the service, not the mere pittance
which so many of those now receive, hul
a sum. which, with other means that
the pensionei may be able to command,
would lift him and those depending upon
him above want.
There Is a growing feeling that the pen?
sions enjoyed by many thousands who
are iu lull health, find comfortably fixed
in life, .should be terminated, and the
Government be thus enabled to more
nearly discbarge itsduty toward the help?
less and the miserable.
If the pension list could be nriuted,
every community iu the land would be

a pension should be a badge of shame.
These sentiments are rapidly gaining
ground among men whose friendship for
the soldier never has be*n and neuer can
in- successfully disputed.
Fitst and most numerous among those
who ri-i. t<? denouu'e SUCh views are tho
pension claim agents. Of course, tiiere
are honorable and honest men among
them Hut, as a class, they have robbed
and rifled "ml plucked the soldiers tonn
,?xtcnl which entitles them to all the hon?
ors of freebooters. By their persistent
pursuit of veterans and their heirs, and
their alluring representations, which have
generally been misrepresentations, these
accents have undoubtedly been responsi?
ble for half the pension roll. They have
profited to the extent of many millions
by fees, which, In the main, have been
exorbitant. Durum the past year, as the
figures iu tho pension otlico will show,
th?*y ha^e collected much more than halt
a million dollars from the pensioners,not
counting tho minor fees and expenses
charged to them, which bring the attor?
neys'charges to tlie pensioners'of the
year well up toward the million mirk.
Veterans should know that there is no
necessity whatever for employing claim
-agents. Blanks can he had at the pen?
sion o!!:ce covering all cases, and pension
CLtents and the special agents of the nllice
in the liehi will give every information.
The body of clerks here are experts, and
every ease receives full and intelligent
examination, and each claimant receives
detailed informal ion of tho proof re?
quired, and all without cost to tho appli?
cant. All this annbes to wort.hv cases, i
who make a specialty of such eases is im?
perative.
The huge dimensions of the pension
roll are largely due to the fact that tho
Government let the preparation of cases
go out. of the hands of its own force into
those of attorneys. If is one of the most,
marked cases ot the fhepherd abandoning
tho llock to wolves which the history of
any nation affords. it. is not too lato to
save veterans who have not yet been de?
voured. When the annual payments of
all kinds to this class amounts to a mill?
ion dollar; a year Congress can do a kind
act to veterans, their widows and or
phans by providing that no fees shall be
paid upon any claims for pensions filed
hereafter.
The experience of Congressmen who
show the least disposition to restrict pen?
sion legislation uniformly discloses the
fact thai the army of pension attorneys
at once proceed to raise a clamor. Their
tain, their letters, aud their circulars
glow with the loftiest sentiments of mock
patriotism. In their essence these decla?
ration* are to the elfect that veterans
having saved the country have a. moral
-ight to loot it. IScfore the apparent
Storms which theso performers raise,
many good resolutions touching pension
reforms vanish. But the time .seems to
have arrived when the pension situation
will command the attention which it de?
serves, because restrictive measures are
both just and necessary.
It Is In the interest of every deserving
pensioner and every self-respecting vete?
ran that unworthy pensioners should be
exposed, and the success of undeserving
applicants should be prevented. Tito sit?
uation strongly appeals to the members
of all patriotic, societies'for help. If tho
spirit tif lSiil stilt lives, it should not bo
difficult to create \ sentiment among tho
veterans that unworthy pensioners can?
not In- In-ill to le in good and regular
standing. ,
Tho feeling among Congressmen is
that, in the nature of the case, anv prop?
osition for pension reform should ema?
nate from the Republican side,and, more,
important still, from gome prominent
Union veteran, if ono of sufficient coin?
age can be found to lead.
It is regarded as prohahlo by thoFo
whoso judgment in this matter should be
good that unless revisionary or resliict
ive measures or both be soon adopted,the
ppnsion list for the next year will reach
$150.0110.0(10. and thai in three vears II
will be $ 170,000,00t..
