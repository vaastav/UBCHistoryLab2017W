JOE

HE STATES REASONS WHY JOHN
LANE'S PETITION SHOULD BE
DISMISSED.
The following demurrer to the pe
tition of James Kulike et al asking for
a recount in the election contest of
John Lane against Joe Fern for the
position of Mayor of the City and
County of Oahu, has been filed In the
Circuit Court:
Comes Joseph J. Kern, respondent
above named, in his proper person, and
demurs to the petition filed against him
in the above entitled proceeding, and
for causes of demurrer shows:
1. That said petition does not state
facts sufficient to justify the granting
of tho relief prayed for therein, or
any relief against this respondent, un
der the provisions of Act 118 of the
Session Laws of 1907,- or under any
law or laws of the Territory of Ha
waii. 2. That the allegations of said pe
tition are ambiguous, unintelligible and
uncertain, in that It appears therefrom
that although petitioners claim that
one John C. Lane, a candidate for the
office of Mayor of the City and County
of Honolulu at the recent election re
ferred to in said petition, received a
largo number of votes which were le
gally cast for him but not counted, and
should have been declared duly elected
to said office, it further appears fromi1" Jolm f- Greene-
paragraph numbered 11 of said petition
that the total number of votes claimed
by petitioners to have been so legally
cast for said John C. Lane for said of
fice of Mayor numbered only 2188,
whereas the official returns as set out
in paragraph 4 of said petition showi
that said John C. Lane received a
total of 2212 votes, and that respondent I
Joseph J. Fern received a total of
2220 Votes for said office of Mayor and
was duly declared elected to said of
fice. 3, That it does not appear from said
petition in what election district or
districts the petitioners, or any of
them, are now, or were at the time of
the holding of the election referred to
In said petition, qualified voters.
4. That it does not appear from
said petition that the required number
of qualified voters of any election dls-

RECORD
pa
A Star extra fifteen minutes
beforo eight o'clock this morn
ing gave Honolulu tho full text
of tho President's message as
given to Congress at noon to
day in Washington. It covered
nearly four pages of tho paper,
.and was the biggest extra, as
far as matter contained is con
cerned, ever printed in Hono
lulu. The message was eagerly
sought by many business men
and especially were the para
graphs relating to Hawaii per
used with interest. The extra
was much appreciated on every
hand, and was commented upon
as a big Journalistic "beat."
:
CLAIM THAT A HAWAIIAN SEN
ATOR IS DISQUALIFIED BUT NO
ACTION IS LIKELY.
The case of David K. Baker, whose
ineligibility for tho Territorial Senate
was called attention to In The Star
yesterday, has attracted a great deal
of attention among the politicians in
this city, but the attitude mentioned
appears to bo one of apathy. No mem
ber of the Senate wishes to take the
matter up. Tho Republican Terri
torial Committee does not like to mix
up in it. Tho Attorney General's de
partment is ready to go ahead if pro
per complaint is made by the last
named body, or by a privato citizen,
but does not look on tho matter aa
something which it should .Interfere
In without some such action.
One of tho members of the Senate
from an outside island In speaking of
the matter, said:
"Yes, I am a Republican and I be
lieve that Baker has no right to bo In
the Senate. In his action of holding
on to tho Job as deputy sheriff, he has
forfeited any such position to which
he might have been elected by the
people. Still I do not think that the
Senate will take any action and doubt
If the Republican Territorial Commit
tee will do anything. It would bo
called a persecution of a Hawaiian
and they don't daro to tackle tho mat
ter In my personal opinion the re
cent charges against Baker should ho
enough to bar him from the Upper
House."

TRIKING
SENTENCES
(Associated Press Caic to The Star.) 1
WASHINGTON, D. C, December 8. The message of President Roose
velt has been received today in Congress and has been read. After the
reading both Houses took a recess. t , -mi-
net aeo
By PRESIDENT ROOSEVELT.
"The coast-wise shipping laws should he amended to meet the spe
cial needs of the islands, and the alien contract labor law should be
so modified in its application to Hawaii as to enable American and
European labor to be brought thither."
"I again recommend the extension of the ocean mall act of 1S91
so that satisfactory American ocean mall lines to South America, Asia,
the Philippines, and Australasia may bo established."
"The work on the Panama Canal is being done with a speed, ef
ficiency and entire devotion to duty, which make it a model for all
work of the kind."
"This Nation's foreign policy is based on the theory that right
must be done between nations precisely as between Individuals, and
In our actions for the last ten yea rs we have in this matter proven
our faith by our deeds. We have behaved, and are behaving, towards
other nations, as in private life an honorable man would behave to
wards his fellows."
"The gathering of a Philippine legislative body and Philippine as
sembly marks a process absolutely new In Asia, not only as regards
Asiatic colonies of European powers but as regards Asiatic posses
sions of ou.er Asiatic powers; and, indeed, always excepting the strik
ing and wonderful example afforded by the great Empire of Japan
It opens an entirely new departure when compared with anything
wnich has happened among Asiatic powers which are their own mas
ters." . , " . ,.
"Our earnest hope and one dosire is that the people of the island
(Cuba), .shall now govern themsolves with Justice, so that peace and
order may be secure". We will gladly help them to this end; hut I
would solemnly warn them to remember tho great truth that tho
only way a people can permanently avoid being governed from with
out is to show that they both can and will govern themselves from
within."
"I believe thftt under the inter-state c!auseVof the Constitution the
United States has "complete and paramount right to control all agen
cies of Injerestate commerce, and I believe that the National Govern
ment alone can exercise this right with wisdom and effectiveness so
as both to secure Justice from, and to do justice to, tho great corpora
tions which are the most Important factors In modern business. I be
lieve that It Is worse than folly to nttempt to prohibit all combina
tions as Is done by the Sherman anti-trust law, because such a law
can be enforced only Imperfectly and unequally, and Its enforcement
works almost as much hardship as good,"
"Telegraph and telephone companies engaged In interstate busi
ness should be put under the jurisdiction of the Interstate Commerce
Commission,"
"The railways of tho country should be put completely under the
Inter-state Commerce Commission and removed from the domain of
the anti-trust law."
"I advocate the Immediate admission of New Mexico and Arizona
as States. This should bo done at the present session of the Con
gress. The people of the two Territories have made It evident by
their votes that they will not come in as one State. The only altern
ative is to admit them as two, and I trust that this will be done with
out delay."
"There must be prohibition of child labor, diminution of woman
labor, shortening of hours of all mechanical labor; stock watering
should bo prohibited, and stock gambling so far as is possible dis
couraged. There should be a progressive inheritance tax on largo
fortunes. Industrial education should bo encouraged. As far as pos-
stblo we should lighten the burden of taxation on the small man."
