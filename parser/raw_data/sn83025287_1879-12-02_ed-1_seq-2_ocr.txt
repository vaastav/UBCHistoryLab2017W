BT. PAOL, TUESDAY. DEO. 2, 1879.
WHAT will Mr. Hayes do for starch with
which to keep his backbone stiff now that
Zach. Chandler is gone? We are afraid he
cannot bo very stalwart under the circum
stances.
IT ia reported from Washington that the
Democrats in Congress are not at all pleased
by the finanoial recommendations of
Mes3rs. Hayes and Sherman. It would be
more wonderf al if they were pleased.
JOHN SHERMAN is reported to be indignant
because of the piemature publication of his
report. Tho people have abetter right to
be indignant at the premature recommenda
tions it contains. These would be in ample
time five or six million years hence.
A FEW hot-heads from the South are call
ing for Grant and monarchy as a pleasing
change from the existing order of things.
Almost anything, it is true, would be an im
provement upon our present conditio*, but
this would be equivalent to jumping from
the frying pan into the fire.
MILWAUKEE IS talking of getting up an
annual exposition ot the products of that
town. If we are not mistaken that city has
a permanent exhibition of the article. A
sample may bo obtained every second door,
at the rate of five cents, and in a few local
ities one can get "zwei glass fur fauf cent."
MB. THUEMAN is of the opinion that the
defeat of Ewmg Ohio was not a result of
any Dtsmociatio blundering. The campaign
was full of blunders, and if the Republican
was the party guilty of such mistakes, we
would advise the Democrats to waste no
time in commencing to blunder. It will
greatly improve its prospects of success bj
such a course.
As yet the state department has received
no answer from Great Britain in relation to
the Fortune Bay outrages upon our fisher
men. There is no explanation of the delay,
but it is supposed it is due to the fact that
England proposes to justify the conduct of
the Canadians, and is now engaged in gath
ering evidence bearing on the subjeot. If
this is the ease Mr. Evarts will doubtless
have a ohanoe to measure diplomatic swords
with the British secretary of foreign affairs.
THE fiist act of Mr. Hayes on the assem
bling of Congress was to send in the name
of Secretary McOrary to be a United States
ciromt judge, in place of Dillon, resigned*
It is very evident that Mr. Hayes is anxions
to make room for our Aleck in his cabinet,
but Congress may not feel disposed to grant
him tho opportunity as the office of secre
tary of war will have to be vacant before it
can be filled, and MoCrary will not surren
der it nnul he is settled down for life in a
judgeship.
A DISPATCH from Washington states that
the present month will develop some extraor
dinary things in the political line at Wash
ington. The Republicans claim that the
result will be the complete annihilation of
the Grant boom, while Mr. Speaker Itandall
claims that before- the close of the session
Mr. Tilden will be the only person spoken of
for the Democratic nomination iu 1880.
We are inclined to think that both parties
are following what will prove to be more or
less of an ignis fatuus. Whatever Congress
shall do will make but little change in the
present aspect of the Presidential question.
THE SUPREME COURT.
Among some of the complaints to whioh
Mr. Hayes, in his annual message, gives
voice, is the fact that the supreme court of
the United States is overburdened with busi
ness, and as a consequence the decision of
oases is greatly hindered to the great incon
venience and often to the pecuniary injury
of litigants. There are now a sufficient num
ber of cases filed for a hearing before that
tribunal to ocoupy the justices for three
years to oome, and those having important
matters pending will be likely to be obliged
to possess their souls in patience for that
length of time before knowing their rights
or daring maintain them. The remedy sug
gested by the attorney general and approved
by Mr. Hayes, is the appointment of addi
tional oircuit judges and the creation of an
intermediate court of errors and appeals
which shall relieve the supreme court of a
part of ite jurisdiction, while a larger force
is also obtained for the performance of oir
euit duties. It would involve, if tea addi
tional circuit judges are appointed, an ex*
penditure at the present rate of salaries of
not more than $60,000 a year, which would
certainly be small in comparison with the
objects to be attained.
To our mind the remedy is notan adequate
one. Nine times out of ten the litigants
who now carry their grievances to the su
preme court will never be satisfied with any
decision by a lower tribunal. The estab
lishment of a court of errors or appeals,
.thereforeunless its decisions shduld be*
made Amiwould only delay the advance
ment of causes t the court of last resort and
increase the oost of litigation. It would
compel a man asserting his rights to con
tend for them in fonr or five different courts
instead of three or four as at present, and
proportionally increase the business. A far
better plan, it seems to us, would be to re-
br&^A
ps^H^^f "^W:^W^
lieve the supreme judges of all circuit duty
so as to enable them to devote their entire
tin.e to theconsideration of causes that may
be brought before the supreme court proper.
By adding, say, two more to their num
ber, the work might be greatly expedited,
and the large business now on the
docket cleared off. Such a course, however,
would involve the necessity of increasing
the number of circuit judges also, or of re
distributing their work. Three or four more
circuit jadges could, no doubt, fill the de
ficiency created by the retirement ot the su
preme judges from circuit duty, as there are
some whose labors are now insignificant and
might be increased without imposing any
grievous hardship upon them.
There is no doubt some Congressional ac
tion needed regarding this matter. There
are plenty of good lawyers in both houses
whose practice in the supreme court will
enable them to see the evils existing and
suggest abetter remedy than the establish
ment of intermediate courts that only tend
to hinder rather than facilitate litigation. If
it is the object to discourage the
people who may think themselves wronged
from seeking redress by legal means, it will
be accomplished in part by this extra ju
dicial machinery. But this is not the true
idea of justice. Access to the courts ought
to be obstructed as little as possible, for
every citizen, no matter how humble, has a
right to recourse to legal remedies for inju
nes he may suffer. By speedily hearing and
deciding all causes much hardship would be
prevented, for it is no uncommon thing for
appeals to be taken to the supreme court for
the simple purpose of delay and in the hope
that compromises may be made pending the
hearing that will do an injury to one of the
contestants.
REDUCE THE EXPENSES.
The report of the secretary of the treasury
conveys some very interesting and suggestive
facts connected with our finances that it
would be well for our oitizens generally to
read and inwardly digest. It is shown that
the total ordinary expenses for the fiscal year
ending June 80,1879, were, in round num
bers, two hundred and sixty-seven millions
an increase over the previous year of nearly
thirty millions. The actual and estimated
expenditures for the current fiscal year, end
ing June 30, 1880, amount to the round sum
of two hundred and sixty four millions, and
for the succeeding year to two hundred and
thirty-eight millions. The increased amount
expended last year was due largely to the
payment of the Halifax award and the arrears
of pensions, thoagh most of the departments
show an increase over 1878, There is a de
ficiency in the sinking fund of over thirty
millions, but a small amount having been
transferred to that account daring the year.
These enormous expenditures, actual and
estimated, indioate great prodigality on the
part of onr officials in the |disbureement of
the people's money, and a disposition to
keep up the lavish establishments as far as
possible in the future. Deducting the pen
sion roll and the interest on the public debt'
the only two expenses that are attributable
to the late war, we find that the ordinary ex
penses of the government amount to the
enormous sura of nearly a hundred and fifty
million dollars annually. The last year's
expenses of Buchanan's administration
the most extravagant year of Democratic
rule in our historywere less than ninety
millions, which shows that the wants of our
office-holders have increased to the extent
of over sixty millions of dollars a year, and
this after deducting liberally for what are
known as war expenses.
We suggest that it is about time a reform
was instituted. The men who pay our taxes
are obliged to be content with less remuner
ation for their labor than at any time since
1861, and it is nothing more than fair to de
mand of their servants holding official
position that they likewise consent to a re
duction of their emoluments to an ante-war
basis. There are too many officials Who are
too extravagantly remunerated for very un
satisfactory work. Congress oan begin at
the present session to apply the knife to all
excessive appropriations, and insist that Mr.
Sherman shall apply the surplus revenue to
a reduotion of the publio debt, so that the
interest account may be redaoed as far as
possible.

JBRIDQINQ DETROIT RIVER.
A Protest Fro in Governor FillsborySec
retary McCrary's Reply.
At a meeting of the ohamber of commerce
a few weeks sinoa the joint resolution of
Congress, approved June 20, 1879, relating
to abridge aoross the Detroit river, at or
near Detroit, and providing for the ap
pointment of aboard of engineers to con
vene at that oity to consider the subject, was
discussed at length.
A protest was sent the secretary of war,
and the Governor was t-Iao asked to tend a
protest, which be did as iollows:
ijTATIS OF MlJNESOrA, 1
ExEctnifK DEPARTMENT.
St. Paul, Nov. 14. 1879.
Hon. George W. McOrarv, Secretary of War,
Washington, D. O.
Sm:In compliance with resolutions of the
ohamber of commerce of St. Paul, and pursu
ant to my own convictions upon the subject, 1
beg leave, respectfully, but earnestly, to pro
test against the construction of abridge across
the Detroit river,as contemplated by the board
of engineers whioh I understand are to meet in
Detroit on the 18th inst, for the consideration
of that and other matters.
I need scarcely state that the vast and grow
ing commercial interests of thin State and of
the rapidly settling country north and west, de
mand unobstructed navigation through the
great lakes and their connecting channel*. It
is indeed difficult to exaggerate the magnitude
of these interests or the rapidity of their
growth. The annual wheat export of this
State alone exceeds twenty-five millions bush
els, a large proportion ot whioh seeks water
transit to the seaboard by all the great lakes.
A much larger proportion of the increasing
products of Dakota is dependent upon this
route alone for the means of reaching the mar
ket, while the transportation which will be re
quired to keep pace with the development of
the agricultural and mineral resources of the
vast conntrv drained by the Northern Pacific
ri'lroad baffles computation.
An ample, unimpeded water communica
tion must for a long time be the
only means of successful defense
against exactions of railroad combinations,
with which these great interests are constantly
threatened. Anything, therefore, which jeop
ards in any manner this free water transit as a
means of corns eting transportation is justly a
cause of serious alarm. That the proposed
bridge over the Detroit river will prove an ob
struction to such free navigation cannot be
doubted, and I therefore, on behalf of the peo
ple of this State, and of the vase country whose
interests are deeply involved, protest against
its construction. Most respectfully, your obe
dient servant, J. 8. PILLSBUBY,
Governor of Minnesota.
To this Secretary MoCrary returned the
following reply:
WAR DEPARTMENT, WASHINGTON CITY,
November 25, 1S79.
SIB:Acknowledging the receipt of your
communication of the 14th inst., protesting
against the construction of abridge across the
Detroit river, 1 have the honor to enclose here
with, for your information, a copy of the re
port upon the subject by the acting chief of
enineers,-dated November 22, which contains
a copy of the joint resolution of Congress, ap
proved June 20, 1S79.. pursuant to which the
board of engineer officers, to which yon refer,
was ordered to convene at the city of Detroit,
Michigan, and whioh, it will be observed, does
not authorize the construction of a bridge.
Very respectfully, your obedient servant,
GEO. W. MCCRABV, Secretary of War.

Messrs. Zahra & Mann Bid it Offat $51,400.
The entire stock and fixtures of A.
Strouse's dry goods store were sold yester
day morning by Sheriff King.^ The sale was
attended by a large number of dry goodb
merchants of this city, and representatives of
several Eastern firms. The sheriff, after
making the preliminary arrangements,
stated that tha stock woulct
be sold in a lump
and the lease of the store at a rent of $200
per month would go with the sale if the pur
chaser desired. The stook had been inven
toried at $78,000, and the terms of the sales
would be $7,000 down and the balance be
fore Saturday night. Bids were then called
for, the sheriff announcing that the judg
ments in his hands amounted to $47,000 and
he would reserve the right to reject bids
under that sum. The bidding commenced
at $25,000 and rapidly advanced to $49,000,
at which point the sheriff announced
that the sale would be positive.
The bidders, among whom were noticed
representatives from Lindeke, Warner &
Schurmeier, William Lee, Esterly & Heine
mann, D. W. Ingersoll & Co., Mannheimer
Bres., A. H. Strouse, and several Eastern
firms, then dropped out of the field, leaving
the matter to D. W. Ingersoll, of Ingersoll &
Co., and Henry E. Mann. The figures then
went up at $25 advances until $51,300
was offered by Mr. Ingersoll. Mr. Mann
raised that sum $100 and the entire stock,
fixtures and lease were accordingly knocked
down to him for $51,400,
The purchasers of the stock, Zahm &
Mann, are enterprising young men engaged
in the dry goods business at 110 Port street.
Immediately after the sale a force of clerks
were put to work assorting the stock, and
the intention of the firm is to open the
store for business on Saturday.
ST. ANDREWS DAT.
The First Annnal Supper and Ball of the
St. Andrew's Society of St. Paul.
The St. Paul St. Andrew's society held
their first annual supper and ball at Pfeifer's
hall, last evening. There was a goodly com
pany of ladies and gentlemen present, em
bracing some of our leading Scottish oiti
zens. Preliminary to the supper there was
an address by the president of the society,
Mr. M. Taylor, followed by songs by various
members of the society, music by the Great
Union band, an address by Dr. Hamilton,
and various other enjoyable social exercises.
Finally, shortly before 11 o'clock, the guests
marched into the commodious dining halt
adjoining, where a fine cold collation, with
hot oysters and coffee, was spread by Booth,
the Wabashaw street caterer. This disposed
of, the company returned to the dancing
hall, where they chased the glowing hours
with flying feet through a programme com
posed of twenty numbers. It was late this
morning before the dancers took to then
carriages and were driven home.
The affair as a whole wa9 an enjoyable
one, highly creditable to the society. An
abridgement of the first part of the pro
gramme, perhaps, would have been an im
provement, and it might be well on future
occasions not to give both a supper and ball
on the same evening. Nothing occurred,
however, to mar the harmony of the occa
sion, and all present were seemingly well
satisfied with the entertainment.
River Business and the Levee.
Considerable routine business was trans
acted at the chamber of commerce yesterday,
but the only matter of public importance was
the passage of the following resolutions of
fered by Mr. McOlung at the last meeting
They passed withont a word of debate.
WHEBEAS, The Congress of the United States
has determined to improve the Mississippi
river so as to give a minimum of four and one
half to five feet depth of water from the Gulf
to St. Paul and
WHEBEAS, This improvement will make St.
Paul the depot and entrepot fo an immense
river commerce, requiring levee accommoda
tions many miles in extent, for barges, steam
ers, and water crafts of every description and
WHEBEAS, The commanding position of St.
Paul at the head of navigation of the Missis
sippi river, is the one distinguishing feature
possessed by no other city, which gives her
prominence over all competing points and
makes her unrivaled as the coming metropolis
of the Northwest therefore
Resolved, That the present limited levee fa
cilities of the city are wholly insufficient for
the necessities of commerce to follow the con
templated improvements and that immediate
stjps should be taken by our city authorities
to provide for the wants of the future by con
demning the entire frontage of the river on
both sides from one end of the city limits to

the other, of such a width as will be ample for
the levee business of a lare-e city and to widen
the principal thoroughfares leading to the
levee so provided for.
Resolved further, That while this ohamber
favors the most liberal treatment of all rail
roads entering the city, no privileges should
be grantedjo any of them which would sur
render any portion of our levee to suoh an ex
tent as,to interfere with the commerce of the
river and the mayor is respectfully requested
to insist upon the reserved right of the city to
regulate and control the levee, before any ar
rangements now pending may be finally jon
Mim mated.
Resolved, That a committee of fivo be ap
pointed to present these resolutions to the
mayor and common council, and urge them
upon their immediate attention.
KELLOGG SPOFFORD.
The Peculiar Characteristics of Louisiana
Witnesses Again IllustratedWarmoth
and a Horse Thief Tell Their Stories.
NEW ORLEANS, Dec. 1.In the Kellogg-Spof
ford examination, O. M. Tennison testified re
garding the election iu the Seventh ward in
1876. Names were erased from the books with
a pencil, and the ballot of the person entitled
to vote refused. Charles J. Boatner testified
concerning the meeting of caucus committee
at Seymour's office. Blaokstone, in the pres
ence of others, told witness that he and several
other members were paid by Louis J. Jones to
vote for Kellogg. The members gave due-bills
for the amount so received. This was done so
as to make it appear as a loan in case of dis
covery. Witness saw Blacks tone sign the affi
davit. Think he understood it.
J. O. Nicholls, refeired to in Blackstone'a af
fidavit as receiving $1,000 for his influence for
Kellogg,testified that the statement was untrue.
Ex-Governor Warmoth testified that he had
been in both the Packard and Nicholls legisla
tures at the time of Kellogg1
election. There
were rumors of bribery but witness knew of
no one who bad been bribed or who had ac
knowledged receiving anything for their votes.
Pinchback was running against Kellogg, while
witness was the dark horse. At the caucus
Kel'ogg received a large majority vote. Witness
and his friends resolved to prevent
Kellogg's electien by revolutionary means,
uch as breaking a quorum, but being unable
t't carry it out it was abandoned. On the day
of election witness voted for Kelloeg and made
a speech advising his friends to do so. Gov.
Warmoth said he had voted for both Kellogg
and Spofford so as to be sure he was rigct.
D. 8. Gaston, special police officer, was em
ployed to work up evidence against Kellogg.
Got no pay. Worked because he wanted to
get Kellogg out of the Senate. Milan told me
he got $50U from L. J. Souer for voting for
Kellogg. Heard Biackstone say he got paid.
E. Garrett, recalled, made a long
statement concerning his career dur
ing the past twenty years, show
ing that he had beeu arrested in Missouri for
stealing a horse, and arrested here during the
war charged with embezzling government
property. Witness explained the circumstances
ia these cases, claiming he was innocent. Also
explained several charges against him for mis
appropriation of government money, for
which, though innocent, he was arrested and
imprisoned at Shreveport. At the beginning
of the war he was charged with being an abo
litionist. Broke jail by consent of the deputy
sheriff and escaped. In Jackson, Miss., during
the war, he was arrested chained with being
a Union officer. Gave bond for appearance.
In order to destroy the bond set fire to the
office where the bond was kept during the
time, burning up the building and entire
square on which the office was situated.
NoteGarrett testified a few days ago to the
effect that he was sergeant-at-arms in the
Packard legtslature and members had told him
they were paid to vote for Kellogg, but hip tes
timony has since been impeached. He took
the stand to explain something, and cross-ex
amination by Senator Cameron brought out the
above.
The committee expect to leave to-morrow af
ternoon.

The Emigration Pamphlets from Minnesota
to be Extensively Circulated in England
and IrelandFather Nugent's Impres
sions of His Visit to Minnesota a hhort
Time Since.
Some little time ago Hon. Dillon O'Brien,
of this oity, wrote an emigration pamphlet
for especial circulation iu England and Ire
land, in advocacy of the Catholic coloniza
tion scheme that has done eo much for Min
nesota. He sent the manuscript to Father
Nugent, who will be remembered as having
visited our State about a year ago. A note
received by Mr. O'Brien from that gentle
man conveys the intelligence that the pam
phlet will shortly be published, and one
steamship paoket company has agreed to
circulate 50,000 copies in Ireland and an
equal number in England.
At a recent meeting at Liverpool Father
Nugent made an address to a large gather
ing, in the course of whioh be urged the ad
vantages presented by Minnesota to thoBe
desiring to find a home in the new world.
In speaking of his visit to the State Father
Nugent Raid:
The reverend gentleman then proceeding
to speak of the Catholic colonization in Min
nesota, said some of them were already
familiar with what Bishop Ireland was do
ing in this matter. For years he had lifted
up his voice, and asked the bishops and
clergy of America to join with him in
preaching that the Irish people should not
only give up drink, but also leave the crowd
ed Eastern cities, and go into that immense
Western country whore there was land for
every man who was willing to till it. Bishop
Ireland had succeeded, and he (Father
Nugent) hoped before many weeks to lay
befoie them a map in whioh they could read
the signs of his success. He could show
them on that map the names of Irishmen
who had, some 80, some 160, some 400, and
some even 900, acres of landmen who a
few years ago possessed not more than 60
or 100. ThefirstCatholic colony that he
visited was that called Rosemount, some
twenty miles from St. Paul. He was driven
out there in a carriage, and met by the
pastor, who took him to one of his parish
ionersa man who, a tew years ago, went
mto that district with only 700 dollars.
He had now a magnificent two story farm
house situated in a beautiful and well stocked
orchard and garden it was elegantly fur
nished, and in the drawing-room stood a
piano which had cost $500. Around the
house there were sheep and cattle of every
description, and the whole place had an air
of comfort and abundance. He found that
the owner of that farm was a straightfor
ward, hard working, simple man, who, if he
had been in Liverpool, would have worked at
the docks, or possibly stand in Brunswick
street, or Chapel street, looking for a few
days' work during the week. When he ex
amined into the circumstances of that man,
he found that he possessed 900 acres of land,
his own property, and that he had amasse'd
$50,000, which he had securely invested,
at an interest, not of two and a half,
or three or four, but of ten per cent,
fie had spoken to the pastor about his
people, and he found that they had
succeeded, one and ail. This visit took
place on a Saturday, and on the next even
ing he made his way to De Graff, where the
bishop had secured a* district of land some
twenty-four miles long by twelve broad
Twelve miles further on was the equally sue'
cessful colony of Clontarf. Tuen again
there were the Catholic colonies of St. Adrian
and Gracevillethe latter called after the
honored and venerable bishop, Dr. Grace
and the still newer one of Avoca, a na-ae
that filled the minds of Irishmen with pleas
ant recollections. He had spoken to the
colonists, and ail of them with whom he had
conversed had told him that they were suc
ceeding and they had attributed their sua
cess to the exertions of their good bishop
and the temperance principles which he had
instilled into them (applause). He wished
this subject to be known far and wide, not
meiely in Liverpool, but also throughout
Ireland, so thit those who had now a dark
cloud of want and suffering overshadowing
them might be lifted up and
helped to cross the ocean and settle in a land
that teemed with abundance, and where they
would not be subject to a varying climate,
or to the oppression of landlordsWloud ap
plause)but where they would Bs the own
ers of the soil, and would have no one ba
themselves to blame if they did not succeed
(applause). In this colony of Avoca the
price of the land was from five dollars to six
and a half dollars per acre, and might be
had on the following easy terms: At the
time of purchase, all that was required to be
paid down was the first year's interest in ad
vance, at the rate of seven per cent. at the
end of the first year, the interest only for
another year at the end of two years, one
tenth of the principal and a year's interest
on the balance at the end of three years,
one-tenth of the principal and interest on
balance at the end of each year, after this,
twenty per cent, of principal and interest on
balance, until all is paid. To better illus
trate: supposing a man on the 1st of Janu
ary, 1880, contracted for 80 acres of land
at five dollars an acre, that would come to
four hundred dollars, with 7 per cent, inter
est added, whioh he would pay as follows:
Jan. 1st, 1880, At thej-time of
purchase, one year's interest
in advance, at 7 per cent $28 00

Thus for about 112, paid in easy instal
ments, the first two years not exceeding more
than 5 12s. a year, a man might become
the owner of eighty acres of good land, and
obtain a comfortable home and living. In
the first year, if he sowed wheat in April, he
reaped the produce in August. He might
remark that the average return of wheat
throughout Minnesota was seventeen bushels
to the acre. Thus a man at once became
owner of the soil, and lived in his own house,
and worked for himself and his children.
He had Catholic schools at his door, and also
a churchfor in each of these colonies al
most the first building erected was a Catholic
ohnroh (applause). If he had placed before
them facts which he had noticed during his
hurried visit to America, it was not that thev
might leave Liverpool at once and rush,
away to the west, but he thought this subjeot
of Catholic colonization was worthy of their
best consideration, and he asked them to
^^S^MM^^M!^
turn it over in their minds. Why shonld a
poor man who had a knowledge of agricul
ture, and five or six children able to help
him, be wasting his time in these islands,
where so many are grasping for the same
loaf? After speaking of the fertility of the
land in Minnesota, and the comparative ease
with which it is cultivated, the reverend
speaker said he had no desire to overdraw
the picture for them. If a man went out
there without forecasting what he bad to
encounter he would find himself in awkward
straits but if they had 100 in tbe savines
bankand he had urged them for the past
six or seven years to lay by what they could
sparean industrious wife and grown up
sons or daughters, he said to them, in the
name of God, "Go out of Liver
poolout of this atmosphere of pov
erty and misery and immorality."
Let them write to Bishop Ireland, tell him
that they were going to take eighty acres of
land next year, that they wanted him to have
fifty acres ploughed for them this "fall," and
that they also required a farm house. He
would have the house built and the land
ploughed. With $100 they could purchase a
span of horses, a plough, and as soon as they
bad paid up $537, the land was their own.
They could grow excellent wheat and pota
toes, raise stock and poultry, and they would
soon become prosperous. They or their
children would not be exposed to the temp
tation to drink, because in the Catholic colo
nies no grog shop was allowed to be set up.
Blessed, thrice blessedsocially, physically,
and religiouslywere the people who were

Eort Snelling JSrldge.
To the Editor of the Globe:
The Dispatch of this city had a notice in
a recent issue of that paper (the 24th inst.),
in relation to the present status of the Fort
Snelling bridge construction, wherein the
engineer (Sewall) stated "that he had a force
of men at work on the road through the
reservation, the line of which had been ap
proved by General Terry. The road had
been altered so as to make it about one hun
dred feet longer, by orders of Gen. Gibbon."
This is all well enough so far as the bridge
approaches are concerned, and credit should
be given to the commissioners therefor, but
the publio are anxious to know all about the
bridge itself, without which the approaches
are useless.
The people of Ramsey county, and par
ticularly the citizens of St. Paul who have
so patiently waited for the completion of
this bridge, are very anxious to see verified
the immense traffic that was to find its way
from Hennepin ad other counties by way
of this bridge, thereby adding another feeder
to the commercial and general business in
terests of St. Paul.
It may not beout of place to refer to a com
municationpublished in the St.Paul Dispatch
August 7th last, signed XXX., wherein the
writer hints very strongly at the delay of
the ironwork construction of said bridge,
using these words in the premises, "And
further it may be to the interest of the con
tractor to enlist the sympathies of the
bridge commissioners (composed as they are
of highly honorable business men) to so far
aid him as to admit of or consent to the
erection and construction of the iron work
when the river is frozen over sufficiently to
allow operations to be performed on the ice,
thereby lessening the labor and cost of
building the superstructure, for whioh favor
there is no doubt the contractor would feel
under very many obligations to the aforesaid
honorable commissioners."
How far right the correspondent above re
ferred to was, the publio will be able to
judge by referring to the reported statement
made by the contractor before the commis
sioners at their meeting of the 24th of
November, hereinbefore alluded to. Here
is what he is reported to have said: "Mr.
Horton, the contractor for the work, was
also present, and he stated that he had the
invoices for all of tho cars of iron, and that
there could not be more than one thousand
pounds in ail back. He said also that in
the present condition of the river it would
be impossible to proceed with the long span
until the river was frozen solid, as the run
ning ice would prevent the scaffolding being
erected."
So correspondent XXX. was right in
his surmise of August 7th, but what excuse
can be offered for the gross delay between
August 7th and now, even admitting that the
delay occurring in the delivery of the iron
was caused by the brte boom in the iron mar
ket? Why coula not substantial piling
have been driven before the ice season set
in, upon whioh to erect scaffolding? In fact
one would suppose that any contractor of
ordinary intelligence, with a desire to com
plete his contract within a reasonable time,
wonld have spared no pains or expense to
have at least prepared and had his available
and* proper timbers, scaffolding, machinery,
etc., ready on the work to immediately take
hold of and put the iron-work in place in
said bridge.
That such is not the case is shown by the
contractor's own confession.
The honoiable commissioners can hardly
escape publio censure in this matter to them
the publio have looked for the proper and
duo enforcement of this very important con
tract, and, as understood, the contract calls
for the completion of the bridge by the 1st
of September, and here we are, on the 26th
day of November, with a plea in abatement
put in by the contractor that he cannot put
the iron work on the long span until the ice
in the river is frozen solid to enable him to
erect his scaffolding. Suppose we have
a very mild winter, and who knows
to the contrary? Where then is the
Fort Snelling bridge? Already have our
merchants and others largely suffered by
this unpardonable delay. The produce and
trade that would have sought a market over
this route has gone off in other directions,
and even that which may have oome by way
of Mendota has possibly crossed the Waba
shaw street bridge, adding greatly to the
already too orowded and dangerous traffic of
said bridge, whose tottering condition it
would be well to examine before we have
another St. Charles bridge catastrophe here.
