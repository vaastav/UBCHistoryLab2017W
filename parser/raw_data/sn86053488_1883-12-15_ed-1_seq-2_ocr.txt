The Supreme Court of Georgia has

company played at Madison and took tiie

to appear in Columbia, S. C, ou the night
following. A collision below Madison,
caused the train conveying the profession
als to be delayed and it was impossible to
make connections so as to reach their des
tination in time. In this suit the point was
whether Hayden could recover the entire
amount ot the loss or only the amount he
had paid out for railroad tickets and reas
onable compensation for actual loss of time.
The court below held that he could recover
the entire amount of los. The Supreme
Court held that the peculiar nature of a
passenger's business could not be consid
ered unless it was made known to the rail
road, and as in this instance the railrond
had no such notice at the time it sold Hay
den tickets for the transportation ot him
self and company, Hayden could not re
cover more than the price paid for tue
ticket.
The tramps are southward flying.
