President’s Messare.
TTe give this document to our read
ers in an extra this week. "We had
made arrangements for laying it be
fore our readers at an earlier cay, but
was disappoi ited in receiving it in
time.
Asa literary production the Mes
sage is a very fair state paper. Its style
is in advance of any ether document
we have seen from the nen of Mr.
John'Sov. Ihe President, it will be
seen adheres to his “ Policy” with the
tenacity of one who believes himself
right, and unwilling to be convinced
to tie contrary. lie advances no
thing new upon the su : ject. and his
reiteration of his oft ex ress< i views
will have little weight with Congress
since the people have so unanimously
pronounced a preference for the
course pursued by C ongress in c "o
sltion to that of the President. In
fact, the devotion of one-th'.rd of ]..
message to petti; ..is own .
M ?wy mocb a 3
fore a court after a jury lias deci 1 I
it by a unanimous verdict, and will
probably have Just about as much ef
fec t.
The message gives a very flattering
exhibit ot tns financial con a.:, n
the country, which (.aim t - ■ olio r
wise than gratifying to all. Our
en nn is national
faster, than
most sanguine, an I ye’ the country
continues to prosper beyond prece
dent.
Upon tiie subject of our foreign re
la tio ns t - - • not
new, though that portion t u .... g
upon Mex
not as clear as might oe and -ir J.
The message is not as l--;;gtby as
might l.av'e been expected in times
like these. Our rcadc rs can peruse it
for themselves and judge o: its merits
without further comment.
