cancel the
assessment
Tn a short session last evening the
City council accomplished considerable
business. Among ether things which came
up for discussion was the fact that re
pairs on the library building have not
been completed on time.
Alderman Mayo referred to the fact
teat the Esehle Plumbing and Heating
company had not finished Us work by the
first of this month as required by its
contract.
The company is supposed to forfeit $25
for each day the work is delayed, and the
alderman thought it was not pushing the
work as it should.
Building Inspector Lane explained that
the contracting company was forced to
delay work in order to get certain valves
which were required by the specifications
made by the city.
To Collect the Forfeit.
Alderman Duggan thought the forfeit
for delay of the work s.iould be col
lected, especially as the .Unary would
have to be closed if the weather grew
colder.
Alderman Manchester made remarks
on the subject, and then it was dropped.
A bronze cannon which was purchased
in Manila from an agent of the Span
ish government was offered to the city
for $50 by the purchaser. John Halla
han of the late Montana First regiment.
The cannon was used by the Spanish
government in making the defense
against the invasion of Spain by Na
poleon. The matter went to the judi

city, furnishing meals for the prisoners

VEST ON THE DOG.
The Famous Senator's Tribute to the
Faithful Animal.
One of the most eloquent tributes ever
paid to the dog was delivered by Sena
tor Vest of Missouri some years ago. He
was attending court in a country toWib
and while waiting for the trl .1 of a cas»
■in which he was interested he was urged
by the attorneys in a dog case to help
them. He was paid a fee of $25 by the
plaintiff. Voluminous evidence was in
troduced to show that the defendant had
shot the dog in malice, while other evi
dence went to show that the dog had at
tacked the defendant. Vest took no part
in the trial and was not dispeaed. to
speak. The attorneys, however, urged
him o make a speech else their client
would not think he had earned his fee.
Being thus urged, he arose, scanned the
face o: each juryman for a moment, and
said:
"Gentlemen of the jury, the best friend
a man has in the world may turn against
him and become his enemy. His son or
daughter that he has reared with loving
care maÿ prove ungrateful. Those who
are nearest and dearest to us, those
whom we trust with our happiness and
our good name, may become traitors to
their faith. The money that a man has
he may lose. It flies away from him, per
haps, when he needs it most. A man's
reputation may be sacrificed in a moment
of iU-conaldered action. The people who
are prone to fall on their knees to do us
Honor when successes with us may be the
first to throw the stone of malice when
failure settles its cloud upon our heads.
The one absolutely unselfish friend that
man can have in this selfish world, the
one tbft .«ever proves ungrateful or
treacherous, is his dog. A man's dog
stands by him in prosperity and In pover

sleep on the cold ground, where the
wintry winds blow and the snow drives
fiercely. He will kb« the hand that has
no food to offer. He will guard the sleep
of his pauper master as if he were a
prince. When any other friends desert,
he remains. When riches take wings and
; reputation falls to pieces, he is as con
: stant in h's love as the sun in its jour

Oldest Observatory. $
: It seems possible that the vatican^fiay

European observatory, says the British
Journal of Photography. In 1852 a

serving the heavens, and. according to

'work on astronomy. Pope Gregory XIII.

Was undertaken in connection with 'the

j little known, and 1S88 is usually cup- j

the observatory. It is said that a short
time ago "a rich American offered to
present the Vatican with a giant tele- ■
scope" and that the instrument will be
even larger than that shown at the
Paris exhibition.

A Mark for Magicians.
"I have the vaudeville habit," said a
diffident, mild man. "Every week you
may see me. beaming, in a box at some
vaudeville performance, but I tremble
with fear when I see by my program that
. , _
a magician is to come on. For my nature
.... , .
is r^ing; I love to blush unseen: but
magicians invariably single me out and
make me help them in their tricks. Last
week, for instance, I stood in the front of
my box for quite two minutes, holding
'at arm's length a huge paper bag con
taining an egg. My hand and wrist
looked extremely red a-nd bony: the
thought that the audience was regarding
their ugliness filled me with shame. Yes
terday a female magician at this theater
made tea out of sand and began to pass
it around to assure the aduience of its
reality. Would she tackle me? I drew
back in the shadow, but her eye caught
mine somehow, and she advanced to the
box rail from the stage, extending her
tray. 'Please try my tea, sir,' she said,
and I grinned awkwardly and took one of
the cups. In full view of the audience I
drank it, and felt like a Mol. Hang these
magicians, I say. I don't go to the the
ater to make an embarrassed ass of my
se.f in helping them to earn their pay."—
