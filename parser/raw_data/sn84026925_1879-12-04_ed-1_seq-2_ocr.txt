YORKVILLE, S. C.s
THURSDAY MORNING, DEC. 4, 1879.
. GOVERNOR'S MESSAGE.
We publish in full on the first page of this
issue, the message of Governor Simpson to the
General Assembly, delivered on the 25th ultimo.
It is an able State paper, in which
opinion our readers will readily concur on
neriisal of the document. The recommenda
tions and suggestions it contains give evidence
that the matters treated were carefully considered,
while they are of a practical character,
having for their object the interest and
welfare of all the people of the State.
THE CHIEF JUSTICESHIP.
^ter inCorumTmtinftfrk^Ju^?ow
exciting the greatest attention amonglegSTB5-"
tors and outsiders, is the ponding election of a
Chief Justice for the Supreme Court, which
will become necessary by the expiration, in
a short time, of the term for which Chief
Justice Willard was elected. Associate Jus^
ticc Mclver is a prominent candidate for the
position, and the opinion is confidently expressed
that he will be elected. Should he be
chosen, there will then be an Associate Justice
to elect. With this probability in view,
a number of persons are already spoken of as
aspirants, among whom are Governor Simpson,
Hon. W. D. Porter, and Judges Pressley,
Thomson and Kershaw.
It will be remembered that Chief Justice
Willard was elected to supply the vacancy
and fill out the unexpired term occasioned by
the death of Chief Justice Moses. The latest
rumor is that Willard is not willing, at
this time, to "step down and out," and if this
rumor should prove to be correct, the outlook
is that quite a muddle will be the result. It
is said that Willard claims that his election
(although in terms for the unexpired term of
Judge Moses,) entitles him to hold the office
for a full term of six years, and that he is determined
to maintain that position. In the
event that a successor shall be elected by the
Legislature. Judee Willard will leave it to
that judge-elect to obtain the office of Chief
Justice by quo vxirranio. The questions at
issue would be determined by the Supreme
Court. Judge Willard, being an interested
party, could not sit at the hearing, and Associate
Justice Mclver is a candidate for Chief
Justice and most likely would be the claimant.
The judges to fill this Court to hear the
case would be appointed by the Governor,
and the Governor is a candidate for the Supreme
Bench to fill the vacancy to be caused
. by Judge Mclver's promotion.
CONG BESS---PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE.
Congress assembled on Monday last. The
message of the President was read in both
houses. In his message he congratulates
Congress 011 the successful execution of the
resumption act, and among the beneficial effects
resulting therefrom he cities the fact that
since the resumption of specie payments, there
has been a marked and gratifying improvement
of the public credit
On the question of currency, he says the
coinage of gold by the mints of the United
States, during the last fiscal year, was $40,986,922.
The coinage of silver dollars since
the passage of the act for that purpose, up to
November 1st, 1879, was $45,000,850, of
which $12,700,344 have been issued from the
treasury and are in circulation, and $32,300,506
are still in the possession of the government.
The pendency of the proposition for
unity of action between the United States
and the principal commercial nations or
Europe to effect a permanent system for the
equality of gold and silver in the recognized
money of the world, leads me to recommend
that Congress refrain from new legislation on
the general subject. The great revival of
trade, internal and foreign, will supply, during
the coming year, its own instructions,
which may well be awaited before attempting
further experimental measures with the coinage.
I would, however, strongly urge upon
Congress the importance of authorizing the
secretary of the treasury to suspend the coinage
of silver dollars. Upon the present legal
rates, the market value of the silver dollar
being uniformly and largely less than the
market value of the gold dollar, it is obviously
impracticable to maintain them at par
with each other if both be coined without limit.
If the cheaper coin is forced into circulation,
it will be coined without limit, soon become
the sole standard of value, and thus defeat
the desired object, which is a currency of
both gold and silver, which shall be of equivalent
value, dollar for dollar, with the universally
recognized money of the world.
The removal from circulation of United
States notes with the capacity of legal tender
in private contracts, is a step to be taken in
our progress toward a safe and stable currency
which should be accepted as the policy
and duty of the government and the interest
and security of the people. It is my firm
conviction that the issue of legal tender paper
money, based wholly upon the authority and
credit of the government, except in an extreme
emergency, is without warrant- in the
Constitution and a violation of sound financial
principles. The issue of United States
notes during the late civil war, with the capacity
of legal tender between private individuals,
was not authorized except as a means
of rescuing the country from imminent peril.
The circulation of those notes as a paper
money, for any protracted period of time after
the accomplishment of this purpose, was
not contemplated by the framers of the law
under which they were issued. They anticipated
the redemption and withdrawal of these
notes at the earliest practicable period consistent
with the attainment of the object for
which they were provided. The policy of the
United States, steadily adhered to from the
adoption of the Constitution, has been to
avoid the creation of a national debt, and
when from necessity, in the times of war, debts
have been created, they have been paid off on
the return of peace as rapidly as possible.
With this view, and for this purpose, it is recommended
tjiat the existing laws for the ac-|
cumulation of a sinking fund, sufficient to
extinguish the public debt within a limited ;
period, be maintained.
On the subject of taxation, he suggests that!
if any change is deemed necessary by Con-,
gress, experience has shown that a duty can
be placed on tea and coffee which will not'
enhance the price of those articles to the con- j
sumer, and which will add several millions
of dollars annually to the treasury.
In disposing of the Mormon problem, the
Presideut says, Utah has a population sufficient
to entitle it to admission as a State, and
the general interests of the nation, as well as
the welfare of the citizens of the Territory,
require its advance from the territorial form
of government to the responsibilities and
privileges of a State. This important change
will not, however, be approved by the country,
while the citizens of Utah, in very considerable
numbers, uphold a practice which
is condemned as a crime by the laws of all
civilized communities throughout the world.
He mentions that as the law for the suppression
of polygamy has now been decided by
the Supreme Court to be within the legislative
power of Congress and binding as a rule
of action for all who reside within the Territories,
there is no longer any reason for delay
or hesitation in its enforcement. It should be
firmly and effectively executed. If not sufficiently
strong in its provisions it should be
amended, and in aid of the purpose in view
he recommends that more comprehensive and
more searching methods for preventing, as
*mnIok?n/? +V*?o nn'mo Ko r\rrvtM HoH Tf I
UCU 00 puuiciltilg, bliio VltlliV WW Vf >UVV.. - necessary
to secure obedience to the law, the
enjoyment and exercise of the rights and
privileges of citizenship in the Territories of
the United States may be withheld or withdrawn
from those who violate or oppose the
enforcement of the law on this sutyiecU?;
?.The President mak^s^ pjea lor the election
laws. HTsayrttieTlections of the past year,
although held only for State officers, have not
failed to elicit in the political discussions
which attended them all over the country,
new and decisive evidence of the deep interest
which the great body of citizens take in
the progress of the country toward a more
general and complete establishment, at whatever
cost, of universal security and freedom,
in the exercise of the elective franchise.
While many topics of political concern demand
great attention from our people, both
in the sphere of National and State authority,
I find no reason to qualify the opinion I
expressed in my last annual message, that no
temporary or administrative interests of government,
however urgent or weighty, will ever
displace the zeal of our people in defence of
the primary rights of citizenship, and that
the power of public opinion will override all
political prejudices and all sectional and State
attachments in demanding that all over our
wide territory the name and character of citizen
of the United States shall remain one and
the same thing,, and carry with them unchallenged
security and respect. I earnestly ap
peal to the intelligence and patriotism of all
good citizens of every part of the country,
however much they may be divided in opinions
on other political subjects, to unite in
compelling obedience to existing laws aimed
at the protection of the right of suffrage. I
respectfully urge upon Congress to supply
any defects in these laws which experience
has shown, and which it is within its power
to remedy. I again invoke the co-operation
of the executive and legislative authorities
of the States in this purpose. I am fully
convinced that if the public mind can be set
at rest on this paramount question of popular
rights, no serious obstacle will thwart or delay
the complete pacification of the country, or
retard the general diffusion of prosperity.
The subject of civil service reform is treated
at length. Under this head, he says a
large and responsible part of the duty of restoring
the civil \service to the desired purity
and efficiency, rests upon the President, and
it has been his purpose to do what is within
his power to advance such prudent and gradual
measures of reform as will most surely
and rapidly bring about the radical changes
of system essential to make our administrative
methods satisfactory to a free and intelligent
people. By a proper exercise of authority,
it is in the power of the Executive to
do much to promote such a reform, but it
cannot be too clearly understood that nothing
adequate can be accomplished without cooperation
on the part of Congress, and considerate
and intelligent support among the
people.
He refers to the work of the civil service
commission and the failure of Congress to
appropriate money for the resumption of the
work of the commission. He advocates com
petitive examinations for officers, and says
the economy, purity and efficiency of the
public service would be greatly promoted by
their systematic introduction, wherever practicable,
throughout the entire civil service of
the government. In this connection he also
uses the following language in reference to
contributions from public officers for political
purposes: "It may not be easy, and it may
never perhaps be necessary, to define with
precision the proper limit of political action
on the part of Federal officers, but while their
right to hold and freely express their opinions
cannot be questioned, it is very plain that
they should neither be allowed to devote to
other subjects the time needed for the proper
discharge of the official duties, nor to use
the authority of their office to en fore their
own opinions, or to coerce the political action
of those who hold different opinions. Reasons
of justice and public policy quite analagous
to those which forbid the use of official
power for the oppression of the private citizen,
impose upon the government the duty of
protecting its officers and agents from arbitrary
exaction. In whatever aspect considered
the practice of makiug levies for party purposes
upon the salaries of officers is highly demoralizing
to the public service and discreditable
to the country. Although an officer
should be as free as any other citizen to give
his money in aid of opinion or his party, he
should also be as free as any other citizen to
refuse to make such gifts. Their salaries are
but a fair compensation for the time and
labor of the officers, and it is a gross injustice
to levy a tax upon them. If they are
made excessive in order that they may bear
the tax, the excess is an indirect robbery of,
the public funds. I recommend, therefore, j
such a revision and extension of present!
statutes as shall secure to those in every grade j
of official life or public employment, the pro-1
' ' -M ?1 1 - 1 1!_L A 1 :
leciion wnn wnicn a great auu euugmeueu
nation should guard those who are faithful
in their service."
Considerable space is devoted to our relations
with foreign countries, which, generally,
are represented as of an amicable and friendly
character.
On the subject of the United States Supreme
Court, he says : "In the courts of many
of the circuits the business has increased
to such an extent that the delay of justice
will call the attention of Congress to an appropriate
remedy. The remedy suggested by
the attorney-general is in the appointment
of additional circuit judges, and the creation
of an intermediate court of errors and appeals,
which shall relieve the Supreme Court of a
part of its jurisdiction, while a large force is
also obtained for the performance of circuit
duties. I commend this suggestion to the consideration
of Congress. It would seem to afford
a complete remedy, and would involve, if
ten additional circuit judges are appointed, an '
expenditure, at the present rate of salaries, of
more than sixty thousand dollars per year,
which most certainly will be small in comparison
with the other objects to be attained." I
Referring to the Indian question he says:
"It is ray purpose to protect the rights of the
Indian inhabitants of their territory to the full
extent of the Executive power; but it would
be unwise to ignore the fact that a territory
bo large and so fertile, with a population so
sparse and so great, a wealth of unused resources,
will be found more exposed to the repe
tition of such attempts as happened this year,
when the surrounding States are more densely
settled and the westward movement of our
population looks still more eagerly for fresh
lands to occupy. Under such circumstances,
the difficulty of maintaining the Indian
Territory in its present state will greatly in
crease, and the Indian tribes inhabiting it
would do well to prepare for such a contingency.
I, therefore, approve of the advice
given to them by the secretary of the interior
to divide among themselves, in severalty,
as large a quantity of their lands as they can
cultivate, to acquire individual titles in fee
instead of their present tribal ownerships in
common, and to consider in what manner
the balance of their lands may be disposed of
by the government for their benefit." He
recommends that the decisions arriygtj.-at
during the las^s?s&i#ft-ef-Cohgress, against a
crTauge in contrcl of the Indian service, be
permitted to stand in order to arrest the agi
tation of the subject."
The remainder of the message is devoted
to the depredations on the timber lands, department
reports and District of Columbia affairs.

kiud in the county.
POLITICAL NEWS.
? The citizens, of Indiana will vote next
April on a constitutional amendment changing
the time of State elections from October to
November. If adopted, this would leave
Ohio the only October State.
? The President has lectured some Virginia
Republicans for voting with the Democratic
readjustee, and the Republicans aforesaid
say that Mr. Hayes has never helped the party
in the South, and request him to attend to
his own business.
? Hon. Horatio Seymour, who is now much
talked of for the Democratic Presidential candidacy
next year, will be seventy years of age
next May, is of fine physical proportions, and
has a countenance beaming with intellect and
benevolence.
? It is found, by adding together the vote
given respectively to Gov. Robinson, John

of over seventy thousand !
? Gen. W. W. Belknap, ex-secretary of war,

ed in connection with the position.
? The Republicans seem to be thoroughly
in earnest in carrying out their scheme to j
colonize Indiana with enough negro votes to 1
overcome the Democratic majority at the
next election. A party of sixty colored emi- j
grants recently left Wayne county, North
Carolina, for the Hoosier State.
? The Augusta Chronicle says: "The South
Carolina Senate promptly and emphatically
slaughtered a bill that sought to reduce the
pay of Senators to three dollars per diem.
And the Senators acted wisely. A man
whose services are worth only that amount!
should not be allowed to make laws for a
free people.
? Dispatches from Republican sources now
admit that there is no bull-dozing in Missis- j
sippi, and that the colored exodus is at an !
end. White employers and colored employes
are living amicably together, and colored politicians
agree that there is a vast improve-1
ment in the relation of the two races.
? As to the place for holding the next Republican
National Convention, it is under- j
stood that Secretary Sherman's friends will
work to have Cleveland chosen ; the friends '
of Blaine prefer Chicago; while those of Gen.
Grant say they will be satisfied with either
Chicago or Saratoga. It is the impression
that the convention will be held about the
middle of next May. The friends of General
Grant are anxious for an early convention.
? Governor Hendricks was interviewed at
Indianapolis the other day by a reporter of
the Cincinnati Enquirer, and in the course
of the conversation denied that he had ever
denounced or censured Mr. Tilden in any
way for his course after the election in 1876.
In regard to the statement which has lately
got into circulation that if he did not ohtuin
the nomination next year he would throw the
weight of his influence against the successful
man, he spoke as follows : "That is unjust to
me. I shall support any man whom my party
will nominate. I have no exclusive claim
on any nomination. The people, not aspirants,
are the judges in such matters. I regard
Indiana as a Democratic State, aud
would be disappointed if any nominee of the
party should fail to carry it. At any jfitfr
he would receive all the assistance I could
give hi- ?.
-? There is a rumor, hardly more than whispered
as yet, in political circles in New York,
that Mr. Potter, who was the Democratic
candidate, is to be Lieutenant-Governor.
The official canvass by counties gives Hoskins,
Republican, 122 plurality, but the final count
has yet to be made by a State board composed
of the Democratic State officers. A slight
correction in the returns would overcome this
small plurality, and a New York politician,
who arrived in Washington recently, intimated
that a discovery upon which to base this
correction had already been made. The New
York Times evidently apprehends something
of this kind, as it has said, editorially, "some
loophole may be found when the returns pass
under the inspection of the State board to declare
Potter elected." Elections are not over,
these days, until the last count of the votes
has been made.

LETTER FR9M CHESTER.
Chester, S. C., December 2, 1879.
One evening last week, a number of our
young amateurs gave an entertainment, consisting
of charades and tableaux*, at the residence,
of Mrs. Elliott, for the benefit of Mr.
Ragsdale, who has been confiued to his bed
for a long time with a cancer. Miss Annie
Elliott, a young Miss of about 14 years, was
manager, and the performers were of about
the same age, or younger. Miss Rennie
Trenholm wa9 gracefully crowned Queen of
the evening by Master Eddie Elliott Master
Jimraie Marshall as chief of the wild Indians,
acted admirably. Not having been present,
it is impossible for me to mention the
other characters; but I learn the entertainment
was well carried out. The children deserve
much praise for the noble act. The
price of admission was five cents, and a nice
sum was realized and taken to the afflicted
man by the youthful performers.
Master Charlie Jordan, aged 12 rears, son
of Mrs. Dr. Jordan, of this place, wnile visiting
Rock Hill last week, was thrown from a
horse and his thigh bone was broken. It was
at first thought the limb would have to biamputated;
but he is now improving, under
the skillful attention of Dr. T. C. Robertson.
The party of United States surveyors who

Since the 1st of last September, the receipts
of the Cheraw and Cheste r railroad for freight
and passengers have been over $800, and over
1000 bales of cotton have been shipped over
the road from Richburg to this place.
Mrs. Garland H.Smith,of Carmel Hill, is
a remarkable lady. She is now 54 years of
age, and apparently iu the prime of life, with
not a gray hair on her head, and the mother
of a fine son one year of age.
A colored man oil Maj. J. W. Wilkes'
place, accidentally shot himself in the hand
with a pistol one day last week.
About 700 bales of cotton were sold here
last week at 111 to 111.
A week ago, yesterday, Mr. Webber, of
Spartanburg, while hunting near Bullock's
Creek, was severely wounded in the calf of
his leg, by the accidental discharge of his
gun. His companion, Mr. Wright Osborne,
was also painfully wounded in the leg by the
same load of shot.
Sherman Sanders, a colored boy, 12 years
of age, working on the place of Mr. Zadok
Darby, accidentally shot himself in the leg
with a pistol last Friday. He threw the pistol
away to conceal its possession from his
father, and then claimed to have been shot by
other parties. .
At the sale, last Thursdajr, of the personal

in the Bulletin office, recently married
Miss Elizabeth Hull, of Charlotte, a sister of
Mr. Joseph Hull, the gentlemanly foreman
of the Bulletin.
There was only one sale by the Sheriff last
Monday, and the matter will probably be
adjusted without a transfer of the property.
The Clerk of the Court sold the following
property: Estate of William Agurs, deceased,
on Fishing creek. Three tracts amounting
to 602 acres were bought by C. T. Kee at
from 84.25 to 87.50 per acre. One hundred

estate of Benjamin Grant, 88 acres, was
bought by John Grant for $11.25 per acre.
Eight lots, fronting on Centre and Main
streets, belonging to estate of Geo. VV. Melton,
deceased, were also sold. The corner lot,
opposite the Cotton Hotel, 33x80 feet, was
bought by I. N. Cross for $2,450. Two lots,
one fronting on Main, and the other on Centre

DEATH OF Rev.'J. R. CASTLES.
We regret to announce the death of Rev.
J. R. Castles, a minister of the Associate Reformed
Presbyterian Church, who died at his
residence in Broad River township, in this
county, on Saturday morning last. Mr. Castles
had been in delicate health for some time,
being a sufferer from rheumatic affection,
though the immediate cause of his death was
a disease of the throat.
CORRECTION. *
In the County Commissioners' report, as
published week before last, two errors occurred?first,
the omission of the item of
876, paid to W. J. Stephenson, for services
rendered as clerk of the Board, which, by some
oversight, was not inserted in the copy furnished
us for publication. The other error is
in the item allowed Dr. J. J. Miller for three
post mortem examinations, the amount for
which is 850, instead of $30 as printed.
KOiJBEKY.
On Saturday night last about $200 was stolen
from the money drawer of Withers Adickes'
grocery store. The supposition is that the
thief secreted himself in the store, and after
the doors were locked for the night, helped
himself at his leisure and retired by the back
door, which he could easily open on the inside.
Miles Borders, colored, was arrested on Sunday,
and after a hearing before Trial Justice
Lewis, was committed to jail as the suspected
thief.
ACCIDENTALLY SHOT.

SOUTH CAROLINA SYNOD.
The Synod of South Carolina met at Rock
Hill in this county, at 7 o'clock P. M., on the
26th ultimo, and the Rev. N. W. Edmunds, of
Sumter county, was chosen Moderator.
The Synod of South Carolina, as its name
suggests, js that portion of the Presbyterian
Church in the United States, which is in
the State of South Carolina. The synod is
composed of five Presbyteries as follows:
Bethel, Charleston, Harmony, South Carolina
and Enoree. There are 169 congregations un
der the care of these Presbyteries, connected
with these Presbyteries there are 111 ministers
and about *20 licentiates. Of the ministers,
52 are pastors, 18 are stated supplies, 8 are
without charges, and the remainder are variously
engaged?some as professors in Colum- 1
bia Theological Seminary, some in teaching, \
Unci a few are superanuated.
About 100 representatives were present at 1
the recent meeting of the Synod, of which !
number about 00 were ministers and 40 ruling ,
elders.
The only item of business which called forth
any debate of importance, and in which the representatives
manifested more than ordinary
interest, was a report upon the deliverance of ^
the last General Assembly in reference to |
worldly amusements. The Presbytery of At- ,
lanta asked the last General Assembly if the ,
deliverances of the Assemblies of 1805, 1800 j
and 1877, on the subject of wordly amusements, j
are to be regarded as law and enforced by judicial
process. To this inquiry, the last As- ]
sembly gave a negative answer, and assigned (
as its reason for so doing, because the deliver- <
ances do not require judicial prosecution, and ]
were designed to be only "didactic, adviso- <
ry and monitory." J. L. Girardeau, D. D.,
took exceptions to this deliverance of the >
Assembly, and the Rev. J. B. Adger; D. D.,' t
iefended it. Dr. Girardeau opened the debate.
His speech occupied about two and a j
aalf hours. It was intensely logical, and
portions of it were thrillingly eloquent. Dr.
Axlger followed in reply. To an outsider, the
inly real difference that seemed to exist between
the debators, was, that Dr. Adger felt
Pound to defend the deliverance of the Assembly
because he was a member of that Assembly.
The paper which Dr. Girardeau presented
was adopted at a lata hour on Saturday
night. A number of the members of the Synid
had gone to their homes, and when the
vote was reached only about 60 were present.
Of this number, 36 voted with Dr. Girardeau,
17 with Dr. Adger, and 8 declined to vote.
The Synod adjourned to meet at Sumter on
the 17th of November, 1880.
The meeting of the Synod was a very pleasant
one. The citizens of Rock Hill entertained
the representatives and ministers in princely
style. On Sunday the churches in the town
and vicinity enjoyed the privilege of being
ministered to by members of the Synod.

THE SOUTH CAROLINA LEGISLATURE.
Tuesday, November 25, 1879.
The Legislature assembled at 12 M., and a
quorum being present in each House, irruhediately
proceeded to business. Notices were
given of a number of new bills. Such as
are-of general or local interest, will be mentioned
in our columns after they have been introduced.
In the 8enate, Mr. Taft, (Radical,) of
Charleston, introduced the following concurrent
resolutions which were ordered for consideration
on the next day:
Whereas, it appears that a fearful mortality has
prevailed, during the past season, amongst the
convicts leased from the penitentiary; and whereas,
it is alleged that such mortaiilv has resulted,
in a great measure, from the insufficient and unwholesome
food, improper clothing, iJl-ventilated
lodgings, and cruel treatment inflioted on its victims;
and whereas, it is further alleged that no
inquest has been taken of any one or the many
casual or violent deaths which have taken place
amonst them ; and whereas, it is the duty of the
General Assembly to provide for the redress of
grievances and for the prevention of their continuance
and repetition?particularly in the case or
those who, being restrained of their liberty by
law, are unable themselves to apply to theauthorities
of the law for relief and protection. Therefore,
be it
Resolved by the Senate, the House of Representatives
concurring, That a committee of three
on the part of the Senate and on the part of
the House of Representatives, be appointed to
make immediate inquiry into the circumstances
attending the deatlis which have taken plaoe
omnnor the mnvicts leased from the Penitentiary
during the present year, with power to compel I
the attendance of persons and the production of
papers, and to report the result of their inquiry
to the present General Assembly as early as practicable.
Resolved, That, until the report of the said
committee shall have been received and acted
upon by the General Assembly, the Board of
Directors of the Penitentiary be, and they hereby
are, requested not to hire ont any convicts
from that institution.
The Governor's Message was received, and
after being read, the different portions of it
were referred to appropriate committees having
charge of the respective matters referred
to therein*
After the Governor's Message had been
disposed of, the unfinished business of the
last session was taken up. A bill to amend
Chapter XVI of the general statutes, by the
repeal of Sections 9, 10 and rt, and in lieu
thereof to insert the following: "In case of
the removal, death, resignation or inability
of both the Governor and Lieutenant Governor,
the General Assembly shall immediately
be convened, and by joint vote, shall elect a
person duly qualified to fill the office of Governor,"
was made the special order for December
2, at 12 M.; a bill to provide for the

of the county of Chester to levy
ind collect a special tax, and to provide for
;he payment of the past due school indebtedaess
of said county, was laid on the table.
In the House, the Speaker presented the'
resignations of R. W. Shand,-of Union, and
J. M. Green, of York. W. B. Rice, of Union,
dected in place of R. VV. Shand, and J. A.
Deal, of York, elected in place of C. M.
jreen, being present, were duly sworn in.
The unhnished business of the last session
vas taken up. Four bills to amend an act
o regulate tne costs of plaiptiffs' and defend\
ants' attorneys' costs, and fees of clerks of
courts, probate judges, sheriffs, trial justices
and other officers, and a joint resolution pro*
posing to amend the State constitution so that
the general elections shall hereafter be held
on tne first Tuesday after the first Monday in
June, were referred to the judiciary committee.
Several bills to alter the election laws,
and a bill to provide for registration of the
electors of this State in conformity with. Ar- V.
tide VIII, 8ection 3, of the State constitution
were recommitted to the committee on privileges
and elections. The bill to provide for
the establishment of new school districts in
the several cities, towns and incorporated
villages of the State, was recommitted to the
committee on education. Tiie bill to regulate
the sale of patent medicines and other compounds,
the compocition of which is unknown,
was referred to the medical committee. The

^ *firfmKoT
In the 8e'nate, Mr. Witnerspoon present- ^
ed the memorial of citizens of York county
praying a renunciation by the Legislature
of a certain trust under the will of John
Blair, and the relinquishment of a bequest of
$3,000 to the legitimate heirs of John Blair.
He also presented the annual report of the
County Commissioners of York.
After the adoption of resolutions in regard
to the death of Senator Maurice, of Williamsburg,
the 8enate adjourned until Friday,
at 12 o'clock, M. - -s
In the House, Mr. Murray, of Anderson,
introduced a joint resolution to amend the
Constitution relative to the homestead laws.
Mr. Britton, of Charleston, introduced a
bill to provide artificial legs for all citizens
of the State who lost their legs in military
service from 1861 to 1865; and a bill to prevent
and punish the carrying of deadly weapons.
.
Mr. Simonton, of Charleston, introduced a '
bill to amend the law relative to the foreclosure
and redemption of mortgages. The ob- 1
ject of the amendment is that mortgages of
real estate shall remain nothing but a security
for tbe debt aod couvey no title.
Mr. Cook, of Greenville, introduced a joint- >resolution
proposing an amendment to the
Constitution relative to homesteads.
Mr. Bacon, of Richland, introduced a
joint-resolution for the same purpose. "i
Mr. Morrison, of Hampton, introduced a
resolution instructing the committee on the
judiciary to prepare and report a bill abolishing
the office of trial justice, and providing
for such inferior courts as may be neoesury.
Mr. John J. Hemphill suggested that the resolution
be framed so as to order the judiciary
committee to "consider and report upon the
subject, and not render it obligatory upon it
to prepare a bill precisely as indicated in the
resolution." By consent, the resolution was
referred to.the committee, with liberty of di*?
cretionary action.
The committee on the judiciary reported
adversely on the joint-resolution proposing to ' V
amend the Constitution, by changing the time
for holding tbe elections. The report was
adopted without discussion or comment, and
tbe measure is, therefore, effectually strangled.
Mr. Dargan, from wie same committee, re- ,
ported unfavorably on a joint-resolution to
amend tbe Constitution, relative to the juris- .
diction and term of office of the Probate
Court Report adopted.
On the previous day, Mr. Murray^of Anderson,
gave notice of the introduction of a j
MAaAlistian fn asfv/Mtaam MM An
t'Ulit'UI IUIb I GDUillUVU M# HKIVUIU) WMf VU ^
the 23rd of December. When Mr. Murray
introduced the resolution, Mr. Davant proposed
to amend it by "or as much eatlier as
possible." Amid symptoms of considerable
amusement, -this amendment was lost.
Mr. Cooks-then-tried afct.be other ww<Hproposing
to amend by adding: "Or as soon
thereafter as convenient."
On motion of Mr. Murray, this amendment
was indefinitely postponed. \
Mr. Humbert moved to make the consideration
of the resolution the special Order for
the 18th December. 8everal attempts were
made to lay this motion on the table or indefinitely
postpome it, which were ruled out
of order, and a square yea and nay vote upon
it ensued, resulting in its defeat by 89 to 20.
Mr. Walker, of Charleston, moved to make
the resolution the special order for December
3rd, saying that the Legislature could not act
intelligently before that time, as its work
would not be previously revealed.
Mr. Murray said the Legislature wobld
know little more of its work on the 3d than
now, and if postponements of the consideration
of his resolution Were commenced, they
would be continued. An early adjournment
had onlv been secured last year by providing
for it in the beginning and- working up to it
throughout
Mr. Cooke said that no one realized the
importance of a abort session more 4ban he ^
did. While it might be that the gentleman
from Anderson (Mr. Murray) needed a lash _ ^
over him to bring him up to his duty, he (Mf."*********
Cooke) did not think the other members did. 4
He thought the resolution might well wait for
a week or ten days till the amount of work
before the General Assembly could be estimated.
Mr. Murray suggested that those who think
they need the lash least, are really those who
need it most ' _
The question was then taken on the motion
to make the resolution the special order
for December 3, and decided in the negative.
A vote was then taken on the question of
adjourning tine die on the 23d of December,
which was adopted by 98 to 9. ^ ' :

zens of York county in relation to the wili

ferred to the committee on the judiciary.

Master for the Sixth Circuit and to define his
powers, duties and liabilities, watf referred to
the judiciary committee. /
Mr. J. J. Hemphill introduced a bill to
provide for the establishment of a new township
and school district id Chester county,
with a petition for the same purpose.
After the adoption of tributes of respect to
several members who have died since the last f
session, the House adjourned until Friday at
12 M.
In the Senate, Ohe resolution of the
Q n...n nrJi/MlPn An ilia 99/1 nf DoMmW

was laid over for consideration.

to the treatment of"convicts, was made
the special order for December 2, at 1 P. M.
The bill to authorize sheriffs to appoint
special deputies without the approval of a
Circuit Judge, was passed with amendments.
The following concurrent resolution, offered
by Mr. Crittenden, was made the special
order for December 2, at 1 P. M., and will
be taken up in connection with the resolutions
offered by Mr. Taft:
Whereas, a most revolting account of alleged
cruelty and inhumanity of treatment of a portion
of the convicts of the Slate Penitentiary, who
were hired out by the Board of Directors, to work
upon various public enterprises, has been published
in a prominent journal of this 8tate; and
whereas the charges therein made, although resting
mainly upon the statements of the convicts
themselves, both white and colored, are so revolting
in character as to shock the feelings of justice
and humanity in the bosom of every right-minded
man, and, if true, to call for immediate and
