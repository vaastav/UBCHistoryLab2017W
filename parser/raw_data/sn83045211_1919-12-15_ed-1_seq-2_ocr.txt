MAY DELAY RAIL RETURN
Congress Not Expected to Complet
Legislation by Christmas
Washington, Dec. 15. (By A. P.)
President Wilson has not indicated when
ho will send a message to Congress on
the railroad situation, Whito House
official said today. The President still
has before him the report of Director
General Hincs, of the railroad adminis
tration, on tho pending Cummins and
Ksch bills.
Administration oflicinls say that if
the President has changed his mind
about reluming Hie roads to private
operation by .Innunry 1 ho has not
communicated it to his advisers. It is
conceded now that Congress caunot
complete railroad legislation before the
Christmas recess nnd in the light ,of
this officials generally expect that gov
ernment control will lie continued until
nfter the first of the new year.

The gentlemen who hnie expressed a

David Martin. He is mentioned In
'the mutn-to-ar whisperings that eddy
around South Peuu Square and the
Anti-Cobden Club.
Who Candidates Are
Shrriff Bansley is determined not to
drop into the back water of South Phil
adelphia politics when he drops his
robes as high Bheriff. Hence the con
gressional aspirations nnd the salury
thereof. Mr. Bansley is a member of
Senator Vare's unofficial and personal
cabinet. He deserves to be. He is the
best yote getter in South Philadelphia
and the undisputed leader of a Vnic
Tvnrd. .,
iBadore Stern is n rating lawyer and
a member or the legislature.
" Jnmes Bennett is n member of the
legislature.
The fight in the Third district is go
ing to open new lines of cleaiage in the
old organization. It is an unpleasant
alternative that is being put up square
ly to certain of the ward leaders. Par
ticularly to Senator Martin. As for
David Urtf.nnf, his whole success as
n leaderTias been built upou the corner
stone of regularity. But whaj; is the
standard of '"regularity"?
Does the control of the city commit
tee mark the successful faction ns the
''regular" organization or is it the con
trol of patronage?
If, as Mayor. Mr. Moore plays fair
with ward leaders like Martin and Lane
he will naturally expect reciprocity. Or,
Js the great experiment to be tried of
the attempted survival of political ward
leadership independent of patronage and
jobs?
If it is, then the experimenters are
taking big chances. The unusunl spec
tacle of living upon hope will be pre
sented. , Personal payrolls will become
extraordinarily long and unusually ex-jienslve-r-and

Ventnor. Accompanied by County l)e
tpctives .1. P. Wilson nnd Benjamin
Nusbnnm and City Detective Charles
Itarncst they went to Mrs. Blake's
home.
A detective had been watching Hit
woman since Saturday. The Atlantic
City hospital ambulance ivns called and
Mrs. Blake was ordered to dress. She
did, wearing black clothing nnd a black
hat. This mourning attire was relieved
by a white veil.
' She was assisted from Hip house by
a physician and Kirk I.oielnnil, super
intendent of Hie Boardwalk, who aln
liies in Hie Oriental avenue bouse with
his wifp and Mr. nnd Mrs. A. It. Mil
ler, the hitler his sister.
Shows No Kmotinn
'("iood-bi." she snid to Mr. Love-
land a she entered the ambulance.
"You. vour wife and Mr. and Mrs.
Miller haie been all that any one could
be to nif. My love to you nil."
She Piprpssed no signs of emotion.
At the hospital she calmly undressed
and then listened atteutivdy in her bed
while Chief Sprague reud the warrant
charging her with murder.
Physitinns point to her attitutle as a
f irther indication of n diseased mind.
l)r. Tlionins Youngmnu examjimjd her for
the police and reported that she was
suffering from drug poisoning.
Her attitude-of unnatural calm in the
face of the murder charge wus broken
few times and then only wildly to pro
claim her innocence.
Mrs. Clara Miller and Miss Maude
Miller, mother and sister of the accused
woman respectively, who live at 1-3
Vermont avenue, with Mr. Blake nnd
Esther Blake, ten years old, the other
child of the couple, saw the accused
woman led from her home.
The Vermont avenue home or the
Blake is sepnrated from the Oriental
avenue home of Mrs. Blake by a back
yard of a very few feet. They peered
from the second story window of their
home nt the proceedings. Neither has
expressed any Intention of going to the
aid of the accused woman.
Boy Was a Mute
Mi . Blake said he and his wife had
been married In Kaltlmore about four
teen years ago. Sho was born and edu
cated iu Hint city. About four years
ago they moved to KM! Oowcn nvenue,
Oermantown, but later beparatetl. Ho
refused to tell the cause of tho separa
tion. .
The birth of "Bunny, who was n
route, for sonic reason caused a bar
rier to grow up gradually between tho
two. The mother seemed to have a
superstitious horror of the effect of the
child upon the relations between her
husband nnd her. She said she had
wished for his death at the time of
hi birth.
The woman's relatives sided with her
husband and stajed with him to help
Mn hnnr.ehold.
Esther, the other child, is sick in bed.
Sho hos not been told of Hie fate ot
her small brother. She constantly calls
for him. .. .
No hearing will dp given .Mrs. make
until after the coroner's inquest.
Mr. Blake left here about noon, tak
ing the train for Philadelphia. It is
rumored the tragedy has really brought
tho couple together again, the husband
to pity nnd protect, and that ho has
gone to Philadelphia to engago counsel
to defend his wife, believing her to hare
been insune.

gross and the states, the inuor business
had been constantly heckled with legis
lation by prohibitionists in Cmgrcs
seeking to advance the time for national
prohibition. . ...
These contentions were generally
combated by Solicitor (.eneial King
and William B. Prierson, assistant at
torney general, appearing on mo .
ernment's behalf, who took the position
that the prohibition net is still in full
force owing to the Senate s delay in
ratifying the peace treaty, that a state
of war technically exists, that nntioual
prohibition was necessary for the win
ning of the war and the establishment
later of normal peace conditions and
that such legislation came within thc
war powers pi congress.
Contending Views of I . S, Courts
In declaring the wartime prohibition
act unconstitutional, Federal .District
lutlgo Walter Evans, in Louisville, held
the act conflicted with the fifth amend
ment and enjoined internal revenue of
ficials from preventing the Kentucky
Distilleries nnd Warehouse Co. from re
moving whisky for beverage purposes
from its warehouses.
The act, however, was upheld in the
Dryfoos case by the federal district
I court in New iorK, wnien iiisuusseu

distilled spirits from bond.

Substitute Peace Plans Doomed
And it is plain thnl there can.be no
peace except through the adoption of
the present treaty, with such reserva
tions ns the Senate and the President
ninv agree upon. The plan to declnie
pence by rcoltion of Congress, or- to
effect, a nence bv mean. of the Knox
resolution are doomed lo failure. The
President will never consent to any sub
stitute for his treat) and thc llcpnh
llctius admit the i oiistitiitionnlity thev
ure powerless to effect n pence which
does not meet his approval.
There is u certain reiolt on thp Demo
cratic part of the Senate over thp Pres
ident's Intest utterance. Certain Dem
ocratic Senator nil along have taken
the position thai the While House lias
been too uncompromising. They have
been inclined lo blnme Senator Hitch -
...w.l.- for pivine- the Prpsldptlt had lllll it'P.
But it is certain this Intest step of the
President' was not taken upon ine
ndiice of Senutor Hitchcock, hut on the
President's own initiatiic, and it has
nil along been the President, not Sena
tor Hitchcock, who has been responsible
for the uncompromising attitude of the
Democrats.
, Underwood Taken by Surprise
Senntor I ndcrwood, Mr. Hitchcock's
rival for the Sennte leadership, was one
of the most surprised among the minor
itv over the Intest White House utter
niioe. Mr. 1 ndcrwood hns always been
for compromise, and he is credited now
with a desire to force n compromise.
But these Democratic rovolts do not
get very far. From the first it has been
said thnt the President could not holrt
his party against the Bodge resolutions,
let he held nil hut four or five of them
"upon the important issues. And the
treaty is becoming morn nnd more a
partisan issue. It is harder for the
Democrats to break away from their
party than it was a few months ago.
And the same nrgumpnt applies to
the mild rcbcrvfltionlst Itepublicnns.
There is much talk of compromise, but
compromise renlly is not ns nenr as it
lias been several nines iu inn i" ""."
tho President's statement has made it
more remote.
The lenders on uotn Biaes nro ousu
nate. The national campaign is ap
proaching and thc Icaguc'of nations is
already iniolved iu politics. Both sides
are playing it in a rnther petty way.
Nothing but sueh n business situation
us will force both sides to make con
cessions is likely to bring about the
ratification of the treaty.
They'll be raiding the cnnd.v stores
next," snid one moody mixologist as
he cast nn eye on the unleashed stock.
"We'll have to tic a piece of crepe on
Billy Penn," snid another, "stay in the
house on Sunday nnd live according to
the card index system."
"A Blessing," Says 'Doctor Forney
Thp Bev. Dr. W. B. Forney, pastor
of the Mt. Vernon Baptist Church,
Manayunk, who is connected with the
Philadelphia saohntn .Association, said:
"The Supreme Court could not have
done greater service or the country
Ihnn it hns in making Ihis decision.
It is one of the greatest blessings that
has come lo the people.
"It leally ends the fight against
liquor. Frow now on it will be clear
sailing, for the prohibition amendment
will go into effect within n few weeks."
