ThePresident'* Moasage.
Thisyear's message to congress is,^in a larger sense than Is the rule, a^digest of the annual reports lately^banded in bjr the cabinet officers. Except^la tha summary of foreign relations,^It adda little to the information that^has been given out In the pamphlets^issued by the departments. Almost^without exception, President Cleveland^quotes what the members of the cabi^^net hare submitted, adding, In in^^stances, his approval to the recommen^^dations they have made. We should^atyle It a lasy message^it is not up to^the mark of Mr. Cleveland's former^state papers. It has few suggestions.
Atthe same time, it is worth every^Intelligent citizen's time to read the^message, merely for the reason that It^gives one a good idea of our relations^with tha outside world, while it in^^structs every reader respecting the^run of things in home affairs. AfUr^you have read the message, you have^up to data the facts about the army,^tha navy, the finances, the cattle and^seed department, the postotllce service^and all that.
Publicquestions that vitally in^^terest the West get scant attention in^the message. There is nothing in it^about the silver question; the Pacific^roads have only a brief paragraph re^^lating to the Union Pac lie; the Chi^^nese are not referred to. The Pacific^slope people get not a hint about the^Nicaragua canal; the question of irri^^gation is not mentioned. Evidently,^tha president is of the opinion that the^months of tliu short session will be^taken up with routine nutters respect^^ing which the members of congress^are already fully informed.
Mr.Cleveland's hope is that the tariff^bill will be hauled in for repairs, lie^makes no reference to the results of^tha November election, he draws no^Inferences, but he is out for free iron^snd free coal, and he stands by his^^lews involving the row over sugar,^saying that ho would ^like to see every^particle of differential duty In favor^of refined sugar stricken out,^ Other^^wise, there is no tariff talk in the mes^^sage that will Attract attention. Mr.^Cleveland appears to realize that he^cannot bring the democratic majority^In congress to his tariff opinions.
Thepresident's talk on the financial^Situation is rather dogmatic. He is^in favor of keeping up the reserve-^most people are, for that matter; but^evidently he does not even so much as^entertain sny of the plans which, as an^incident to the silver question, offer^an easy way whereby any needed sur^^plus may be kept intact. He is de^^termined that the ilnal gold-redemp^^tion theory shall prevail. That will^always keep the reserve on draught;^the message incidentally admits as^much. As for the recent sale of bonds,^the message is almost ill-natured in its^reference thereto. Mr. Cleveland's^confession is that it was not the best^plan, but he chides congress for not^having provided ono that is better,^and he asserts that, popular or un^^popular, he Will do the same thing^again If lie thinks best. That is well^enough, us long as the executive is a^man who is intolerant of the better^measures for retail WhiSS hmiiy good^men in congreM have Warmly advo^^cated. We sus|^ect that there must^have been an Inhfihf IWiagS in the^sprained ankle about the time this^part of the alSStagS was dictated.^Under the Cievelsad plan, we shall^have bonds mid bonds, with more than^abundance with winch to ptyaswe
go,If congreaa will undo tha wrong for^which departed ood grasses are to
blame.
Forall discussion of tha currency^question, tha msasaga contents Itself^by giving its approval to a plan for^the reorganisation of tha nationsl^banks. It is tbs Carlisle plan; It Is, in^part, what has corns to bo known as^tbs Baltimore plan. Nothing Is ssid^about an international monetary con^^ference, The aim is to make a new^basis for security for circulation in the^stead of the government bonds now^deposited, as thst security, with the^treasurer of the United States. To s^degree all the national banks are made^sponsors for ths redemption of the cir^^culation of each bank. The scheme is^to give more ^flexibility^ to the cur^^rency. That is to say, the banks can,^it is assumed, more readily increase or^diminish the amount of outstanding^currency than at present.
Then,too, the proposition is that,^under a rigmarole of conditions, the^ten-per-cent tax on the circulation of^state banks be removed. Thst is the^war-time tsx which wss Imposed^really to drive the state-bank currency^oaf, of circulation and expedite the^process of putting the federal treasury^in funds through the organization of^the national-bank system.
Enoughthat the schemes prepared^at Washington show how hopelessly^fsr spart the administration and the^advocates of silver are. From the sil^^ver standpoint, the country asks bread,^and Washington gives a stone. It Is^clear that, even If the democratic ma^^jority in congress were disposed to^take up and discuss sny phase of the^silver question, no good would come^of It as fsr as the white house Is con^^cerned.
Mr.Cleveland speaks of having^offered his good offices to China. Ho^should have offered them to the demo^^crats who elected him.
Thecow department of the message^reflects Infinite credit upon J. Sterling^Morton's administration.
Carnegiesays ^the msn who dies^rich is disgraced.^ But the people fail^to appreciate Mr. Carnegie's efforts to^monopolize all the disgrace.
SinceLi Hung Chang lost his yellow^jacket and throe-eyed peacock feather^he is little rmre than a living picture.
Membersof the labor unions of Hel^^ens hsvo fixed themselves for ths^winter. They hsve succeeded in com^^pleting arrangements with Mrs. Frances^M. Haberly of Terre Haute, IntL, to^deliver a course of twelve lectures on^^The Italian Painters^ City warrants^will probably be taken at the door.
Whatbetween her third of s million^dollars in unredeemed city warrants^and her House of Hershfield, Helena^is experiencing some difficulty these^days in keeping her position of social^supremacy properly adjusted.
Thegable end of Eckels' ignorance^on the currency question Is seen loom^^ing up through the mist of words in^his annual report
Chinswsnts Jspsn to let her down^easy, but Mutsu Hito Is evidently no^parachute.
Themorning after the recent elec^^tions a reporter asked Mr. Cleveland's^secretary what ho had to ssy about the^result. Thurber replied: ^What in^-v^is there tossy^^ The answer is^given In twelve columns of type in^this morning's Standard.
Theofficial count has failed to dis^^close any victory for the enemies of^Levi Morton's coachman.
Adelegation of Chicago business^men are prospecting for trade in^Texas. It is suggested thst even Gov^^ernor Hogg may not be safe.
WhenMr. Cleveland speaka of the^dark spots on the political horizon^abrosd perhaps he refers to Queen LiL
Itis not to be wondered at that the^cashier of the Shoe and Leather bank^w as able to hide.
JerrySimpson would like to see^Tom Reed re-elected apeaker. The^Tom snd Jerry idea ahould be popular^in congress.
Thatpart of the message where the^president refers to the appointment of^an international monetary commission^seems to have engaged in a joint de^^bate with a blue pencil in the hands of^Mike Barter of Ohio,
