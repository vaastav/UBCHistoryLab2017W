TEAMS MEET
AT PASADENA
New YearV Day Chosen
as the Date of
Contest.
Football Game -a, Feature
of the Tournament
of Roses.
STANFORD UNIVERSITY, Dec. 4.-
The. cardinal football eleven will meet
the victorious University of Michigan
football team in a game to be played at
Pasadena en New Year's day. This was
decided at a meeting of the football men
called by Captain Fisher this afternoon
to coneider the proposal of James R.
Wagner, president of the Pasadena Tour
nament of Roses Association.
The University of Michigan eleven has
not betn scored against this season, al
though it has played nearly every tealm
in the middle West. Its largest score was
12S to 0 and the smallest 23 to 0. The
eleven has been perfected under the
coaching of Yost, who coached the Stan
ford team to victory last year. Among
the Michigan players is "Big" Gregory,
■who played center on the cardinal sec
ond eleven last. season, not being eligible
to the varsity.
Captain Fisher has issued a call for
varsity and second eleven men to appear
for practice to-morrow. The practice un
til college closes on December 20 will be
confined to the building up and perfecting
of team work. From then until the play
ers leave for Pasadena daily scrimmages
will occur between the varsity and the
second eleven.
Captain Fisher expects to take twenty
two men to Pasadena, thus including a
number of second eleven players as well
as the varsity team and substitutes.
Most of the men will have a chance to
go against the Michigan aggregation, as
Stanford intends to make as good a
showing as possible against the middle
West champions. ';
President Wagner of the Roses Asso
ciation has also secured the appearance
of the Stanford Glee and Mandolin Clubs
in Pasadena New Tear's night and ex
pects the double attraction of football
game and concert will draw an immense
crowd to the city. •
Olympics' Honolulu Trip.
Advices from Honolulu by the last
steamer seem to assure the trip of the
Olympic Club football team to Hawaii.
One thousand dollars had already been
raised to defray the expenses of the fif
teen men who would be taken from here.
There are four regularly organized foot
ball elevens in the islands. These are
made up of a college team, two athletic
club teams and one of natives.
Manager 1. T. Muma of the Olympic
team has strong hopes that the trip will
be made. The team would leave here on
the 15th inst. There are two steamers due
between the present time and that date.
On either of these may be the necessary
transportation.
Should this trip be abandoned Manager
"Pete" Smith of the Reliance Club is anx
ious for a return game under better
weather conditions than marked the
Thanksgiving day contest.
NEW PRESIDENT FOB
WESTERN BAUL LEAGUE
J&mes Whitneld of Kansas City Suc
ceeds T. J. Hickey, the Latter
Resigning With G. Tebeau.
ST. JOSEPH. Mo., Dec. 4.— The West
ern League has decided to retain its or
ganization practically as it was last year.
It was announced after the meeting here
to-day that there mhy be some change
later on, but it is doubtfuL The meeting
cf magnates was called at the instance of
"\V. T. Van Brunt of this city and of
Thomas F. Burns of Colorado Springs,
the owners of the franchises of these
towns.
The action of President Thomas J.
Hickey in forming the American Associa
tion, taking in some of the cities of the
"Western League, was calculated to ruin
the league. Van Brunt, who was left out
in the new arrangements, began a vig
orous correspondence with the magnates
at other points, with the result that the
meeting to-day ratified the old organiza
tion and accepted the resignations of
President Hickey, George Tebeau of Kan
sas City and George Lennon of St. Paul.
Tebeau endeavored to secure the ratifica
tion of the transfer of the Denver fran
chise by Packard to himself, but failed.
He is out of the Western League entirely,
according to the statements of the mag
nates to-night. James H. Manning -was
granted the Kansas City franchise. The
Denver franchise will go to some person
not yet named. It is undecided who will
get St. Paul, but it may be Lennon will
be taken back into the league, although
there is some objection. James Whitfieid
of Kansas City was elected president, suc
ceeding Hickey.
At to-night's session of the Western
League it was emphasized that clubs
would be maintained in all cities of the
league. The National and Western asso
ciations' presidents were notified that all
they heretofore held Is still claimed. The
next meeting will be held at Kansas City
on the second Tuesday in January.

Biitish Chartered South Africa Com
pany Meets Without the Man
aging Director Present.
LONDON, Dec. 4. — The annual meeting
of the British Chartered South
Africa Company was held here to-day,
under the presidency of the Duke of
Abercorn, who read a telegram from
Cecil Rhodes, managing director of the
company, regretting his absence, but
saying he was now improved in health.
This caused cries of, "Why is not he
here?"
The Duke of Abercorn said the
Rhodesian gold output reached high wa
ter mark in November, and he believed,
as they would soo,n be able to supply
their own coal, and with improvements
in railroad facilities, that Rhodesia would
compare favorably with any gold country
in the world. He also announced that
the Imperial Government had allowed the'
company to reduce the excessive police
force it had hitherto been compelled to
maintain, thereby obviating one of the
chief causes of this year's deficit of
£2S9.29C, while the interest on its cash
securities would fully enable it. to meet
the expenses of 1902.

ments against the Washington Govern

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, DECEMBER 5, 1901.
WYOMING STRIKES HIS GOING
AND TRAMPS IN AT GOOD ODDS
Greyf eld Beats the English Horse, Royal Flush===Josie
Q Outsprints a Speedy Field.
FINALLY, when he was deserted
by the majority of his friends,
who found themselves as light
as an unloaded freight car, Gay-
Ian Brown's old horse" Wyoming
won a race at Oakland yesterday. He
was mixed up with a whole lot of speed
In. the last event on the card,, and
with Birkenruth on his expansive back
returned with the coin at odds of 6 and
7 to 1. Mocorito closed favorite over
Herculean, but does not seem possessed
of her former speed, showing to no par
ticular advantage. Educate left the ban
ner on a skyrocket breakaway, and then
could not last out. Birkenruth with
Wyoming made one of his short turns
into the stretch and, quickly taking the
front position, beat Herculean out two
lengths. Only a few of those who in
dulge in the practice. of "running a horse
down" bet on the winner.
While, the day was clear and pleasant
the track was very sloppy, giving horses
with speed the advantage. Under such
uncertain conditions three favorites had
their numbers flashed first. Under the
improved climatic conditions the attend
ance showed a marked increase over the
preceding day.
Thinking Evander scarcely up to a
bruising race Walter Jennings let his
niaiden 2-year-old run loose in the open
ing scramble. After receding from 6 to 5
to 5 in the books the 2 1 year-old downed
Budd Wade a length, owing chiefly to
Winnie O'Connor's persuasive saddle tac
tics. Major Bird, the favorite, was early
cut off and never after took a hand in the
game.
Once again it looked as if Grayfeld had
had dropped into a soft spot, and this
time Bob Smith's chestnut delivered the
merchandise. It was generally supposed
that Forkford, piloted by Johnny Woods,
was going to cut some figure, and the
Baldwin entry closed nearly an equal
favorite with Grayfeld. Forkford dis
played* a rousing burst of speed for a
second, and then completely disappeared.
After Royal Flush, the Britisher, became
afflicted with the sulks in the stretch,
Birkenruth on Grayfeld blew in at
leisure. •
Rollick, equal favorite in' the ring with
Ned Dcnnid, captured the Futurity course
sprint after a hard drive- with Abba L, a
100 to 1 shot. The latter made all the
running and only at the paddock did she
begin flashing distress signals. Alzura,
probably short a race, finished in the
show.
Fresh and overflowing with speed after
hei rest, Josie G, the fast daughter of
Bloomsbury, defeated St. Sever and Dr.
Scharff for the fourth purse. Rosewar
came in for heavy backing at 6 to 5. and
the filly made a most disappointing show
ing, never -getting up with the leaders.
Josie G was always in front and led St.
Sever past, the wire a couple of lengths.
Ceesar Young's Eonic. the even money
choice for the mile selling run, expe
rienced some poor racing, luck at the
start, but ran gamely, and was returned
the winr.c--. Lee Jackson piloted the filly
and was dly bumped at the first turn,
besides gtiting away from the post in a
tangled uo condition. All this gave J.
Daly, on Galanthus, an opportunity to
open up a gap of daylight over his field.
However, he did not get far away, and
when challenged In the stretch^ by the
favorite swerved in toward the rail and
lost by a length. Bedeck finished only a
lair third.
Track -Notes.
Sixteen books laid odds yesterday. Bar
ney Schreiber cut in, v.hile Joe Harlan
concluded to "buck 'em" from the ground
for a few days.
f Birkenruth was the only rider to pilot
two winners.
Barney Schreiber's Budd " Wade was
tipped about to win the maiden event.
O'Connor gave Royal Flush such a
shaking up that the English horse- acted
in the stretch as if he wanted to run out
the gap.
Hoar rode Abba L. which came within
an ace gf beating Rollick at odds of 100
to 1. The mare ran some remarkably fast
races in Montana this summer at the
shorter sprinting distances. •
But for being bumped by Alzura, Ned
Dennis might have landed the third
purse, y
St. Sever acted sore when he was
brought to the paddock, which caused his
odds to recede from 3 to 5 to 1.

Surprising Feature of
Eastern Bank Teller's
Theft.
BALLSTON, N. Y.,, Dec. 4.—Bank.Ex
aminer Graham was busy all day exam
ining bank certificates presented to the
bank for verification. To-day there were
several developments increasing the de
fault in interest-bearing certificates or
confirming Vice President
suspicions therein. Several * certificates
were presented to-day that are marked
on Teller Fitcham's books as paid and the
account closed. ' *
The bank officials still assert that the
bank can reopen next week on a sound
basis, admitting that their $116,000 surplus
is wholly wiped out by Fitcham's embez
zlements. When the doors closed Monday
night and. Examiner Graham took charge
the bank's assets were $786,000, exclusive
of $100,000 capital; liabilities,- $620,000. .
Fitcham's peculations are now known
to have extended back twenty years. His
individual deposit ledger balanced to a
cent when he closed, it Saturday noon.
Fitcham remains at home under a strong
guard and was too ill to be arraigned this
afternoon. He said the estimates of the
bank's loss were exaggerated and that he
had not taken more than half the sum
mentioned. He said he was not a stock
gambler, but that his trouble was due to
family ! extravagance, j his expenditures
having been for years in excess of his
salary. ' " ■••••'. ' -■

Coroner's Jury Assigns
Reason for Wabash
Disaster.
ADRIAN, Dec. 4.— The coroner's jury
found that the collision on the Wabash
road near Seneca last Wednesday night
between trains 13 and 4 was caused by
the negligence of the Wabash Railroad
Company and the trainmen of train No.
4. The verdict says the railroad company
was negligent in failing to provide train
No. 4 with a head-end brakeman and in
failing to provide proper signals at the
place of meeting of trains 4 and 13. En
gineer Aaron Strong, was found negli
gent ' in failing to properly understand
and obey order No. 82, under which the
train was running.-
Conductor J. W. Martin was found neg
ligent in failing to signal the engineer to
stop and in failing to apply the air brakes'
when the engineer did not give the proper
signal immediately passing the station
signal at Seneca, according to the com
pany's rules. Firema*h Bastien was found
negligent in falling to remind the engi
neer of order No. 82, when the engineer
failed to give the proper signal and slow
up at Seneca. Brakeman A. W. Dlttman
was found negligent In falling to signal
the engineer to stop and in failing to ap
ply the airbrake until after the train had
passed the station at Seneca when the en
gineer did not give the proper signal on
approaching Seneca."- - ■

STRONG HOUNDS
ARE IN DEMUD
Hares Now Running Are
Too Much for the
< Sprinters.
Two Stakes to Be Run at
Union Coursing Park
. This Week.
Eighty-eight greyhounds will be in the
running on Saturday and Sunday at
Union Coursing Park. An open stake of
seventy-two dogs will be run down once
on Saturday and will be concluded on
Sunday. A special stake of sixteen dogs
will be run in its entirety on Sunday. The
hares are surprising the coursing men by
taking the fleet dogs around the field in
courses of two minutes and over. Usual
ly at this time of the year, when feed is
plentiful, the courses are short. The
greyhound which can stay the route Is
still in demand over the sprinter. The

FEDERATION OF LABOR
READY FOR ITS' SESSION
Exclusion of Chinese Will Form On<»
of the Chief Questions
Considered.
- SCRANTON, Pa., Dec. 4.— To-night the
hotel corridors are crowded with dele
gates from all over 'the United States and
Canada campaigning for and against the
various measures that are scheduled to
come up in the big convention of the
American Federation of Labor, which will
be opened here to-morrow. The Pacific

gan of Portland, is fighting for a declara
tion favoring the re-enactment of the Chi
nese exclusion laws, with amendments to
make its provisions apply to all Mongol
ians and its operation unlimited as to
years.
Delegates from the shipbuilding trades
are making a vigorous campaign for a
demand from the federation that the Gov

out the contracts to private parties who
pay less wages and exact more labor than
does the Government.
The resolutions submitted for the con
vention's consideration number nineteen
in all. In addition to several on adher
ence to strict trade autonomy and one
on Chinese exclusion, they declare for the
creating of a defense fund by levying a
10-cent per capita tax; against tenement
and home work by tailors: against the
"progressive cigarette-makers'" independ
ent label; for boycott on the tobacco and
bakery trusts and other alleged unfair in
stitutions; for an eight-hour day for post
offlce clerks; for obligating of members;
to demand the union label on everything
manufactured by union hands; against
any local body declaring a boycott until
the central body approves of it; for the
proportional preferential ballot system;
for the appointment of a. committee to In
duce the masons and bricklayers to affil
iate; for a law making it a capital crime
to attempt to kill the President of the
United States, Vice President or any mem
ber of the Cabinet; establishment of a
bureau of organization.

RAILWAY MEN
THLK OF RITES
Representatives of Many
Roads Hold a Con-
Increase of th9 Car Famine
Prevents a Serious
Problem.
NEW YORK. Dec. 4.— Keprcsent^A'i
of practically every railroad running/:;!^:
of Chicago, with the exception of the
Great Northern, held a meeting to-day in
this city. The business of the session was
unusually brief, entirely routine, and had
to do chiefly with the problem of main
taining freight and passenger rates
through the vast country traversed by
these roads.
Perhaps the most serious problem which
presented itself to the railroad men wan
the increasing car famine which at this
time taxes the capacity of all the more
important railroads. No conclusion was
reached on this point, but it was sug
gested that It might be necessary to make
a per diem charge, instead of a mileage
charge for the use of cars.
Regarding the rate situation, freight
and passenger reports submitted indicated
that these were in a fairly satisfactory
condition. There were no complaints of
rate cutting In some quarters
there was a disposition to attach signifi
cance to the absence of the Great North
ern representative. It was explained,
however, that the affairs of Hill's road
would be amply subserved by others pres
ent at the meeting. No representative of
the Interstate Commerce Commission at
tended the meeting for the reason that no
business bearing on the affairs of this
body was transacted.
In the absence of Chairman E. T. Jef
fery of the Denver and Rio Grande road,
who is now making a tour of the South
west with George J. Gould, the presiding
officer was Joseph Ramsay Jr. of the Wa
bash road. After the meeting Rasr*%y
said that the real business of the co*!lr>
er.ce was transacted at the monthly meet
ings held In Chicago and that a quarterly
meeting was held in this city to give op
portunity for conferences with the presi
dents and directors, but, as a matter of
fact, no meeting had been held here for
a year, and this meeting was somewha:
of a disappointment, owing to the fact
that so few of the presidents and direc
tors were able to be present. Sessions
were held in" the morning and afternoon
and the meeting adjourned shortly be
fore 5 o'clock to meet in Chicago Decem
ber 20.
I "When asked whether there had been
any discussion as to possible interference
by the Western Governors or the Inter
state Commerce Commission with the
Northern Securities Company, Ramsay
said that the conference had nothing to
do with such matters and that the ques
tion had not been touched on. as it was
purely and solely a rate conference.
BANKEKS MTJST TELL
ALL ABOUT CAPITAL
Internal Revenue Commissioner Ben
ders an Important Decision Re
garding Taxable Property.
WASHINGTON, D. C. Dec. 4.-The
Commissioner, of Internal Revenue has
rendered a decision In which he holdav
that bankers must return for taxation
capital, surplus, undivided profits and
borrowed money used in the business o£
banking. The Commissioner holds that
capital is taxable whether Invested, as in
the case of the United States bonds, or
the bank building, or tire circulating, as
In the case of money, including money
borrowed; also surplus, including undi
vided profits.
"In providing that surplus shall be in
cluded as capital," the decision says, "it
is obviously the purpose of the law to
have the tax imposed apply to all money
used or employed by banks as capital in
carrying on their business. Money bor
rowed by banks and used as capital is
held to be taxable, and it is clearly no
less liable to tax because of the fact that
it is borrowed by a bank from Its own un
divided profits.
"The fact that surplus so used consists
wholly or in part of undivided profits, or
that such undivided profits have or have
not been formally set apart from such,
seems wholly immaterial, so far as tha
purpose of the act is concerned. It is the
use and not the authority to use that
brings such profits within the taxing pro
visions of the act."

FRESNO, Dec. 3.— The nominating com
mittee of the Women's Federated Clubs,

ADVERTISEMENTS.
Catarrh has become such a common
disease that a person entirely free from
this disgusting complaint is seldom met
with. It is customary to speak of Catarrh
as nothing more serious than a bad cold,
a simple inflammation of the nose and
throat. It is, in fact, a complicated and
very dangerous disease ; if not at first, it
very soon becomes so.
The blood is quickly contaminated by
the foul secretions, and the poison through
the general circulation is carried to all
parts of the system.
Salves, washes and sprays are unsatis-
factory and disappointing, because they do
not reach the seat of the trouble. S. S.gfr
does. It cleanses the blood of the poisBt* £
and eliminates from the system all catar-
rhal secretions, and thus cures thoroughly
and permanently the worst cases.
Mr. T. A. Williams, a leading dry-good* meiw
chant of Spartanburg. S. C. writes; " For years
