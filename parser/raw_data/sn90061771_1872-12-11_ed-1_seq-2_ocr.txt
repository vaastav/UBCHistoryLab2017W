The President's Message.
The annual mcssago of the Frosidoiit
to Congress at its recent assembling, Is
longer and probably an abler docutnont
than his former ones ; but bo does
nol as was seme lime since intimated he
would, recommend general amnesty, nor
docs he ask for the repeal of the Ku klux
laws. In place of publisliitij? (he mes
sage, which would taka up nearly all our
space, we copy tho following compre
hensive summary from (he Missouri Ro
publican
Tbt present message of President
Grant is a very marked improvement
on its predecessors ; tbo subject mutter
is placed in an orderly arrangement
under different beads, tho treatment ol
llicso heads is clear and vigorous, and
tlicro aro none of thoso raw expressions
that marked one or two of his preceding
cexmumcations. Ibo wholo document
is crata, decorous and well-considered
both in its ideas and its word, as a prcs
idential message should bo.
It opons with an expression of thank
fulnoss to I'rovidenco for a year of blesv
mgs and prosperity unbroken by any
notable calamity except tho lire that re
ccntly devastated tho city of Iloston.
The results of the Geneva arbitration is
claimed as "entirely satisfactory to ti c
government, and in accordance with the
views and tho policy which it main
tained." This result, as has alrcadv
been stated, is the award of the sum of
15,000,000 in gold to the United States
as indemnity for the neirlcct of Great
llritatti in tho matter of the privateers
The president congratulates cultures on
the peaceful and satisfactory character of
the tribunal s deliberations, and pavs a
wall deserved compliment to the Ameri
can arbitrator, Charles Francis Adatiw,
and to tho gentlemen who acted as agent
and eounsci for our govcrtuctit in the
augnst conclave. He recommends the
creation ef a board of commissioners to
apportion the indemnity to thore to
whom it may be due. He refers in
terms of beenming dignity and acknowl
edgement to Kmpcror William's decision
in favor of the 1 1 aro channel as the true
northwest boundary line, and awards to
Mr. Hancroft, our minister to lierlin, the
credit for the preparation and prcsenta
tioa of tho case. 1 is stated that, al
though this decision is not required lo
take efftct for twelve months, her lint
anr.it Majesty has ordered her troops to
?racuato. 1,10 is,anJ of .San J,".a,1 UU.J h

quartor, tlio message recomuiunitj tliu
appointment ot a commission to act
jointly with out appointed by the British,
to mark the line between Alaska and the
British possessions. He ttdvisoi con
cressional action to execute the provis
ions ef thu Washington treaty ou ihe
subject of fisheries, and also an increase
of the force now engaged in making the
boundary lino from Lake of thu Woods
to the Uocky Mountains.
Our friendly relations with Franco,
Russia and Germany form tlio subjest of
one of the most pleasant paragraphs in
the message ; and the suggestion is mado
that congress invito thu international sta
tistical congress to hold its next session
in this country, at the time of tbo Cen
tennial celebration in 1870.
Tho president refers to tho Vienna
exposition in 1873, and advises an appro
priation to oil American inventors and
manufacturers to exhibit their produc
tions there, and also advises that the sec
retary of the navy be authorized to fit up
two naval vessels to transport to Trieste
articles for exhibition.
Our relations with Mexico do not
provoke any significant refcrcuco ; the
allusion is merely formal. On the rub-
ject ' UD3. 'ho mtsiaae shows more
"i'erost. Ihe president attributes the
enntinuanco of the robellion there to the
cxistenco of slavery, repeats his former
rcrnmratudation of measures to prohibit
American citizens Irom holding slaves on
the island, and hopes the present liberal
government of Spain will take stops to
abolish slavery and introduce reforms
into the island. He repeats his recom
mendation of an appropriation for tho
education of four American youths in
Japan and tho samo number in China, for
the purpose of faciliating and strength
cning our diplomatic intercourse.
The receiptD of revenue for the year
ending June 30, 1872, were 8374,100,
S.'i", and the expenditures for the samo
period were $270,559,G95, The reduc
tion of tho public debt for tho year was
99,0G0,253. The total reduction of the
debt for the three yoars and eitht months
ending Nov. 1, 1872, is ?3fi3.G90.9)9.
Tho president thinks any further rcduo
tion of taxation would be unadvisablo,
and ho therefore recommends that legis
lation on this subject be limited to a
mcro correction of errors in the present
system of taxes. Ho thinks the mainte
nance of our crodit dictates this course,
as ho seems to fear that a further reduc
tion may leavo us without means to do
fray the expenses of tho government, pay
tho interest on the debt, and provide for
the einkint: fund. The expenses of the
war department for tho last fiscal year
worn 35.799,991, boing a decreaso of
427,831 from the preceding year. The
estimates for this department for tho
vear ending Juno 30, 1371, ro 33,801,
378.
Tho president invites tho favorable
consideration of tho Georgia canal
schema, and tho James river and Ka
nahwa canal scheme, and, while not
actually recommending them for appro
priations advises tho appointment of i
congressional romnuttoo tn report upon
them. Ho alludes to the post-office
reports, recommends a modification of the
tranking privilege and advises tho ap
pointmcnt of a committee or eommis
sion to devise some equitable method for
purchasing the telegraph linos and con
necting them with tho postal service,
The president refers tn the Ku-klux laws,
regrets tht necessity for them, but avows
his purpose to enforco them with
rigor when occasion requires it, and
makes no recommendation of a repeal of
ttiom. U icavowti u India policy,
and thinks it "bos bn as successful as
ib most ardent fricndi anticipated within
nojhorlk time." Ho speaks favorably
of tho orgauizatlon of tho Indian terri
tory into a regular torritory, care bsing
taken, howovcr, to protect tho Indians
from tho inroads of white men until they
shall ho sufficiently advanced (o protect
themselves.
The message refers with somo minute
nets lo tbo report cf tho patent office, the
department of justice, and thoagricultural
bureau. It approves tho hill now pend
inc in congress for appropriating part of
the proceeds of public lands to education
in tho states. Civil service reform is
reserved for mention ot the close of tho
message. Tho president repeats his
earnest dtsira to reform tho abuses in
the service, and to prevent the offices of
tho government from being regarded us
rewards for pulitical strvices. He prom
ises lo apply the rules on this subject
already devised, and asks congress to
tniko the system binding en his succes
sors. On tho whole, tbt president's commu
nication to congress is an able, practical
and exhaustive ttate paper, and it will
attract very general interest and com
mendation.

A Houseman Takes the Prevail
INO Ei'iuiMic Many publications have
been made recently regarding parties
taking the prevailing epideti.ic, but one
nidi was reported yesterday exceeds
any previously described. About two
weeks ago, James Ivilkellen, who lives
ou ueutord strttt, abovo Uratf, in tho
eleventh ward, and who is carter by ao-
c'jpatios, had a herst which was taken
sick with the epizootic. Tot greatest
care was bestowed upon tbo animal bv
James, and he daily rubbed the horse
down and administered sueh remedies a
be could procure. About a week auo.
while currying off the animal, some of
the virus from tho horse's nostrils was
thrown upon his sore hind, and a day or
so tiler it began to swell, the inflamma
tion gradually extending to the arm, and
increasing until last evening, the area of
the unfortunate man was about the size
of an ordinary man's leg. The physic
ians who are attending Kilkellen have
little hopes of bis recovery. -Pittsburg
