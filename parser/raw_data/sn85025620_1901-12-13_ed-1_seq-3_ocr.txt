Hog cholera doesn't seem to abate
much. It has never been very fatal
fc *hia neighborhood, though there
have been a few cases every ilttle
while for a year or more. It is said
to be prevalent around Rushmore
at present.
But if we have not had many
losses in hogs, there is danger that
we my '.have some in cattle. John
ghore, Isaac Milton and Mike
Thompson have each lost-two head,
and probably there are others that
we have not heard of. It is caused,
it is thought, by feeding on the
•mutty corn stalks. There seem to
be but little chance to do anything
for them, for they die in a short
Aime after showing signs of being
tick. For some days we have not
heard of any more cases, and it is to
be hoped that we have seen the
worst.

Those who take an interest in
politics will have plenty to talk
about and write about for some time
to come. The president's message,
with its suggestions and recom­
mendations will be commented on
by almost every paper in the land
for the most part, I am inclined to
f.hinlr, with approval. 1 think most
people will agree that the message
is a good one, and that it sets forth
the honest convictions of a clear­
headed, patriotic man. We cannot,
of course, all see alike but I think
we can all feel kindly toward a man
whose honest purposes it is to serve
his country faithfully and well. Such
a man most of us believe President
Roosevelt to be and if so let us ac­
cord him the respect and support due
his character and position.

LUCKY FARMERS.
Pierre, 6. D., Dec. 10.—Specal:
Since cream collection routes have
been established in Hand county the
farmers of that county are being
handed 20 cents a pound for butter
fat at their doors, without the work
of churning. The same wagon
which collects cream also collects
eggs, and 20 cents a dozen is paid, all
in cash, and not traded out at the
store. Farmers of that section have
been fumisihng a large amount of
butter to this city at an average of
20 cents, but-have notified the deal­
ers who they have been supplying
that the price has gone up to 25 cents
on both butter and eggs when de­
livered for shipment.
HIGHER SALARIES FOR CAR­
RIERS.
A dispatch from Washington says
that Representative McCleary has
been trying for some time to have
the salaries of the rural mail carriers
raised. He says that several good
carriers have resigned in this district
on account of* the small salary. The
postoffice department thinks it would
be best to increase the salaries by
legislation, and Mr. McCleary will
introdurce a bill providing that the
salares of carriers be $600 the first
year, $660 second and $720 third.

oleo-margarine, introduced by Con­
gressman McCleary on Monday in
accordance with many requests
which have been made upon during
the past six or eight months It is
the former Grout bill without any
changes, as this seemed to suit the
leading dairy men the best.
A BILL.

enacted in the exercise of its police
powers to the same extent and in
the same manner as though such
articles or substances had been pro'
duced in such state or territory, or
the District of Colombia, and shall
not be exempt there from by reason
of being introduced therein in origi­
nal packages or otherwise: Pro­
vided that nothing in this act shall
be construed to permit'any utate to
forbid the manufacture sale* of oleo
margatrine in a seperate and distinct
form and in such manner as will ad­
vise the consumer of its real charact­
er free from coloration or ingredient
that causes it to look like butter.
Sec. 2. That on and after July
first, nineteen hundred and two, the
tax upon oleo-margarine as prescrib­
ed in section eight of the act approv­
ed August second, eighteen hundred
and eighty six, and entitled*'An Act
defining butter, also imposing a tax
upon and regulating the manufac­
ture sale, importation, and exporta­
tion of oleo-margarine," shall be
one fourth of one cent per pound
when the same is not colored in im­
itation of butter but when colored
in imitation of butter the tax to be
paid by the manufacturer shall be
ten cents per pound, to be levied
and collected in accordance with
the provisions of said act.
30,000 CREDITORS.
There are 30,000 creditors of the
M. T. Roberts supply house, mostly
farmers who had sent cash on ad­
vance or small orders, and who
wpuld have done better if they had
tried the C. O. D. plan with the
home merchant. One of the Minne
apoli papers said a couple of days
ago: The schedule of assets and
libilities of the T. M. Roberts supply
house will be filed within a few
days. The scheule is the bulkiest
one ever filed in Minnesota. There
are in the neighborhood of 30,000
creditors have very small claims.
They are possessors of due bills
given for money sent to the concern
before the doors were finally closed.

DOCTORS ON ANTI-CORSET
LAW.
Physicians in Sioux City do not
express approval of the pro­
posed French law making it mis­
demeanor for women under 30 years
of age to wear corsets. It is their
opinion that education must bring
the change instead of legislation.
A measure of the character of pro­
posed by Dr. Marechale, of Paris
for introduction is looked upon as
an infringement upon personal
rights.
"I dont' believe one woman in a
hundred in this country laces too
tightly," said Dr. J. M. Kilbourne."
Anyhow to compel people to dress
so and so is not right. Women are
supposed to have common sense
enuogh to dress as circumtances and
their own opinions dictate. I am
more in favor of all requiring ap
plicaants for marriage license to
undergo through physical examina­
tions, so that consumption, syphilis
and all hereditary diseases could be
prevented from being continued-io.
