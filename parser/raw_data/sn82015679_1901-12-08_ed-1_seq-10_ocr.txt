Several of th Indianapolis basketball
players do not take kindly to the new
basketball rules this year. Purves,- one
of the best players In the city, hut who
ur fortunately ha? not been reinstated as
an amateur, believes that trie new rules
regarding the change of scoring goals from
field from two points to three points will
cause many more fouls to be committed
in a game. Formerly this play counted
but two po!nt3 and as a goal from foul
counts but one point a player will delib
erately make a foul to prevent an oppo
nent from scoring a goal from field. This
can easily be done In a game of basketball
by shouldering, tripping, striking, kicking
or unnecesary roughness. If the score of
the two teams Is close and the game impor
tant attempts to foul will be frequent when
a player has a good opportunity to make
a goal from field. By committing the foul
It will Rive the opposing side an opportun
ity to try for goal from foul, which if made
will count but one point.
Excepting the change in' the scoring the
new rules are practically the same as
last year. One change provides that if
the ball is batted, rolled, bounded or passed
from the field of play it shall be given to
the opponents at the point where it left
the field. Carrying the ball from the
field also constitutes a foul.

Never before in the history of the Short
ridge High School has interest In basket
ball been at such high pitch among the
young women of the school than It Is this
year. Miss McClellan, a teacher In the
school, has assumed the management of
the first team and with the aid of Mis3
tSladys Nehrba, who is captain, a strong
club has been organized. The make-up
of the other teams has been put largely
In the hands of Miss Nehrbas and she
has picked five teams out of sixty young
women applicants. For some time the
young women have been without a place
to practice. The old stable in the rear of
the school, which Mr. Wright promised to
repair for the use of the players, has been
condemned by the building inspector.
Since this order was issued the players
have had no place to practice. The ques
tion was taken to the superintendent of
schools, who promised to bring the mat
ter before the board. Miss Nehrbas has
tecurea me x. w . c a. gymnasium ior
practice. The girl3 will practice Mon
days and Thursdays and Mr. George
Reeves will act as coach. This is for the
first team, however. A practice ground
for the' remaining teams has not yet been
found and it is likely that the School
Beard will provide a place.
Already challenges have been received
from the Girls Classical School and the
. Normal School for games. If the basket
ball team is organized among the girl stu
dents of the M. T. II. S. the girls in tha
Shortridge High School first team will
fend a challenge with a view of wiping
cut the defeat of the football team, it is
fcald. There is some rumors of the girls
of the M. T. II. S. organizing a basketball
team, but as yet nothing has materialized.

The followers of basket ball will be given
a chance Tuesday night to witness the first
games of the season. There will be a
double header in the Y. M. C. A. gym
naslum between the first Y. M. C. A. team
and a five composed of other players who
are memb rs of the Meridian-street M. E.
Church and who are members of the Y.
M. C. A. The second game will be between
the second Y. M. C. A. team and the first
team from the Manual Training High
Hchool. In the contest with the first team
Manager Purvis will give to the Meridian
street five a handicap of fifteen points
This will cause the members of the Y. M
C. A. team to do some great playing to
overcome the lead. It was announced last
week that in all games played by the first
Y. M. C A. team with clubs outside of the
league the second team would also play a
preliminary Käme, making each contest a
double header. Manager Itaum:in, of the
frecond team, has lost several of last year's
team, who are now trying for places on the
lrst team.

j The league season is to open Dec. II. and
fill the player of the leasue are now work
ins hard to get Into condition for the open
Sng game. The two high schools since the
Close of the football season are putting all
their strength tt basket bill and are hard
.it work on their training days in the gym
nasium. The players from the South Side
ehool practice every Wednesday and Fri
day afternoons, while the Shortridge play
ers practice on Tuesday and Thuiduy
f ternoons. Holdson, who played a wo;i
flcrful game on lat year's Shortridge team,
is captain of thU year's five and is now
Jiard at work with about twenty new can
didates breaking them In for positions on
the team. Each ten in in the league has a
large surplus of candidates, and from pres
ent indications no team will be called com
plete until n-ar the clos? of the playing
Reason. It is the purpose of each captain
and manager to use all the substitutes by
ticking from them fives fur different
Sanies. There are, however, players who
made good reputations in last year's
league, and theae will find a place in tho
Kumes this year. One of the old players it
U thought will remain on the team each
fight during the .playing season and In this
Way coach the new material.

At Butler the basketball outlook is en
couraging. Two teams have been practic
ing in the gymnasium for the past month,
during which time several new players
have shown a thorough knowledge of the
game. The material from which to pick
the team this year Is far larger and more
experienced than in any previous year. A
close rivalry which exists between several
of the classes, especially the freshmen and
preps, has brought a large number or
men out in order to make the class teams.
This has aroused considerable rivalry for
positions on the first team. Each posi
tion now is being fought for by several
candidates. The first team will not be
picked until the day before the first game,
which Is with the Training School next
Saturday evening. Emmett S. Huggins is
captain of the team. This is his third year
on the team, playing the position of for
ward or center. This year he will probably
play right forward. Although it was
thought that the loss of McGaughey would
badly cripple the team, it is now believed
this year's team will be fully as fast as
last year's. The most promising candi
date for McGaughey's position (center) is
Tongley. He is over six feet tall. and. al
though new at the game, is fast developing
into a steady, reliable player. Paul Murray,
without a doubt, will play left forward.
He played on the team last year and is
considered the surest man at throwing
baskets. He is fast and aggressive. For
the guards position there is the greatest
rivalry. The fight Is between Butler, Blair,
McIIatten, Kingsbury, Davenport, Long
and Barnett. Butler played on last year's
team and Blair has had several years'
practice, while the other men are prac
tically new at the game. Some of the
other most promising candidates for the
team are Wilson, Brown. Adams, Dyer,
Dodson, Hall, Thornbury, Shimer, Whistler,
Güttin, Mauzy and Martin. Frank B. Long
is manager and Robert Tomllnson assistant
manager. Besides the league games the
management has arranged the following
fixed dates:
Butler vs. Indiana University on orator
ical day, Feb. 8, at Indianapolis.
Butler vs. Purdue, at Indianapolis Jan. 25.
Butler vs. Indiana University, at Bloom
ington Feb 22.
Butler vs. Purdue, at Lafayette March 1.
Besides these games there are games, for
which dates have not been decided on,
with Rose Polytechnic, Franklin, Wabash,
De Pauw, Hanover and State Normal. A
southern trip through Ohio, Kentucky and
Illinois is also being planned.

The Shortridge Bowling League again
bowled on the Pastime alleys yesterday
morning. The best team average was
made by the Delectables, who scored 724.
This team took three games from the Tren-
tons, and the Hoot Möns lost three to the
Mayers.
The standing of the clubs is as follows:
Delectables first, Mayers and Hoot Möns
tied for second and Trentons last.
Bowling Is becoming very popular in the
school and many excellent bowlers are de
veloping among the students.
Howling; Notes.
A picked team of bowlers went to Green-
castle last night.
There are seventy-one bowlers above the
160 mark In the Indianapolis League.
Williams, of the Marions, is still playing
In hard luck by making several splits in
each game.
Ben W. Brown. I. B. L. champion of
ISI'9-IDOO, new leads the league by about
fifteen pin?, with Lew Cooper second.
The Capital Citys came out in new uni
forms Friday night. Their sweaters are
maroon with a white "C C" for a mono
gram. .
The contest for the box of cigars given
"away weekly at the City Club for the high
est score was exciting last week. The high
est score was 2G6.
Frank Burton, of the Ko-We-Bas, who
was first picked as one of the City Club
team to go to Buffalo, will not be able to
make the trip on account of business.
Buchanan, of the Tish-I-Mingoes, has
been playing a great game lately. He piled
up a 216 score last week. He Is getting Into
good condition for the Buffalo tournament.
The members of the Marion and City
Club teams that will go to Buffalo next
month will practically live on the alleys
from now until the time they leave for
Buffalo.
The owners of bowling alleys In Indian
apolis are all in favor of the move to se
cure the National Bowling Congress to
meet In Indianapolis and will support It
liberally.
About twenty members of the Marlon
Club will accompany the team to Buffalo
next month. It is expected that there will
be nearly fifty rooters on hand from In
dianapolis. Ed Wickard, formerly of the North Side
Club, has Joined the Prospects. The latter
team has been greatly strengthened lately
and will make the rest of the Independent
League clubs hustle to win.
The City Club team that has been select

FOOTBALL TALKED DOWN.
Condemned at Debate by Chicago Uni
versity Freshmen.
Football was alternately scored and
lauded, says the Chicago Tribune, by the
freshmen of the University of Chicago at
a debate held last Tuesday night on the
question: "Is Football Advantageous as a
College Sport?" After a spirited forensic
battle, In which interest on both sides ran
high, the decision, rendered on the merits
of the debate, was against football as a
college sport. The decision did not pleas0
a majority of the students present, and
Prof. Chandler, the judge who rendered the
decision, openly declared himself a friend
of the game, in spite of his decision. Dur
ing the heat of the elebate PMson Cook, a
player on the Maroon team, was called out
by the football enthusiasts to defend the
game of which he was a devotee. The gavel
was in the hand of a coed, Miss Louise
Bearse.
"The spirit of the football game is a
bulldog spirit, a prize fight spirit," said
F. L. Cummings, of the team for the nega
tive side of the question. "It is a spult
like that of the gladiatorial days of Rome.
I can speak from experience, because I
have been a football player myself, and I
like the game too. Ihe players are sent
In to hurt their opponents. The coaches
shout: 'Go after them; tear them up.'
AfttT the end of the first half of a game
the coaches say to their men who have not
been playing liercfly: "What is the mat
ter with you? Lay your man out. Do him
up. Lay for him. That is the sort of
spirit they teach. If you don't believe the
players go in for that sort of thing, just
watch them. How can we expect to de
velop men of intellectual attainments in
our colleges when they are sent Into a
football game to run against their oppo
nents and 'kill them off?' "
Football may be full of opportunities
for mean things, but players do not take
advantage of them," said Miss Clara Dtn
ham, a debater on the opposite side of the
question.
"If players cannot win by fair means they
will win by foul." said Miss Frieda Meyer.
"1 know of a university professor who says
that no football players in his class fail.
In many colleges a football man who does
not get through his classes nowadays is a
pretty poor player."
"Football Is a good thing for the players,
because It helps them endure defeat," said
W. K. Morehead. a debater for the affirm
ative. Iot-Senson Kootliull.
The Wisconsin football team Is out of
debt and has $1.500 in the treasurj'. The
receipts this year amounted to nearly X10,-

George W. Woodruff has resigned as
head coach of the University of Pennsyl
vania and will coach the University of
California. There has been much criticism
against Wodruff at Philadelphia this yea-.
Athletic relations between the universi
ties of Michigan and Chicago are hanging
in the balance pending the outcome of
peace negotiations between representatives
of ihe two schools. The University of
Michigan still claims its inalienable right
to an annual football game in Chicago,
while Chicago Is unalterably opposed to
such a game. There is a chance of Chi
cago and Michigan walking in different
paths In the future unless a compromise
is agreed upon.
Correspondence has passed between Yale
University and the University of Penn
sylvania loking toward a resumption of
athletic relations. Many Yale stuuents are
in favor of a football game with the Uni
versity of Pennsylvania, next year.

SIkum YVooelriifT CiOHslp.
Manager Watkins received a letter from
President Hickey, of the American Asso
ciation, yesterday, in which Hickey said
that there need be no fear of the Western
League entering the American Association
territory. Hickey says that James Man
ning Is back of the Western League and
that organization's policy to try and enter
cities selected by the American Associa
tion. Manning is backed by a wealthy St.
Joseph (Mo.) man, who wants to see the
Western League play in big cities in order
to further his Interests In St. Joseph.
President Hickey says the American As
sociation will' begin the season of 1902 with
the same cities forming the circuit that
were announced at the Chicago meeting
week before last. He does not believe that
Omaha will be out of the circuit. There
has been a great deal of talk of Omaha
withdrawing; or, rather, Rourke, who now
owns the American Association franchise,
pulling out of the organization, but Hickey
believes that Manning and his colleagues
have frightened Rourke, who, unfortunate
ly, is not gifted with an overabundance of
baseball political knowledge, and that he
does not know exactly what he wants to
do. Manning has no doubt pictured to
Rourke that he could make more money in
a little minor Western League than he
could in the new American Association, and
Rourke has no doubt drunk In the words
of "wisdom" of Manning, and wants to get
out of an organization that would be a
hundred per cent, better to him than the
one Manning wants him to ally with.
President Hickey says that if Rourke still
insists on leaving the American Association
there are men with a great deal of capital
in Omaha who are very willing to secure a
franchise In the new organization, and, if
necessary, place a team in Omaha anel tight
any Western League team that Rourke
may deem to place in Omaha. Hickey says
that if it comes to a war between the West
ern and American Association that the lat
ter would drive the minor organization to
the wall before the season opens. Hickey
claims he helped the Western League to re
organize for this season, but there are a
few men in the league, backed by Manning,
who stem to think it would be wise to fight
the American Association and go into pome
of the cities chosen by the new organiza
tion. Regarding the Western League placing
clubs in St. Paul and Minneapolis and
even In Kansas City, Manning's eld home,
Hickey says it is absurd, as the baseball
public of those cities were sickened on the
minor league article of ball last year and
want to see their cities in a better organi
zation, such as the new American Asso
ciation. It is easy enough to understand
why St. Paul, Minneapolis anel Kansas
City should be tired ot poor baseball as
Indianapolis had a sample of it last year
and a comparison of the Western League
and new American can be drawn the same
as between the Western Association of last
year and the new American. Patrons of
baseball In the Western cities will support
the new organization over the Western
League the same as Indianapolis patrors
would support Watkins and his club In
the American Association against a team
in the Western Association composed of
Marlon, Dayton, Fort Wayne et al. Wat
kins is in favor of keeping the American
Association circuit intact and does not be
lieve that the Western League could injure
it in the least even If Manning and his
crowd are foolish enough to try and wage
war against the new organization.
xxx
Manager Watkins, who is one of the most
conservative baseball men in, the coun
try, eliscusses freely the proposed invasion
of the Western League into American
Association territory. He does not take
much stock in Manning's proposed war
fare and believes that Manning and his
followers are only bluffing in their threats
to place clubs in Omaha. Kansas City, St.
Paul and Minneapolis. He says, however,
that If the Western ' League insists upon
entering the territory selected by the new
organization that the American Associa
tion must hold its ground and force the
foolish fellows out. He is in favor of re
taining Omaha.
xxx
Manager Watkins said yesterday that he
has signed Orvil Woodruff, outfielder and
catcher, who played in the New York State
League last year. Weiodruff lives in Cin
cinnati and several National and American
League teams have been after him. He is
a catcher and outfielder. Watkins says it
is a little too early to begin talking of the
personnel of the team for next year, as the
snow has not yet fallen. The public knows
of but thret men who are now under con
tractFox, Meyers and Woodruff but still
Watkins promises a good team. Meyers
will play first, as Kelly will again be in St
Paul, where he went after leaving Indian
apolls. it Is not at all unlikely that Hey
don. Bey, Flynn, Hogrlever, Sutthoff and
other ex-Hooslers will again wear Indian
apolis uniforms next year. Bey went to
Cincinnati, and, as Brush has seven out
fielders, it may be possible to secure the
fleet little center fielder for Indianapolis
Hogrlever Is on his farm in Wisconsin, and.
providing he agrees to lessen nis uemanus.
he may come to Indianapolis. Heydon has
not been signed, and there has been a re
port that he will go to the Southern League,
but this has not been confirmed. It would
not be surprising if Kellum. who jumped
to the American League last year, will be
back in Indianapolis again in 1)2. There
will be several old faces as well as several
new ones in the Indianapolis team in 1902.
As far ns the outside world is concerned
the meeting of American League magnates
at Chicago last week was a most harmoni
ous affair. The reports say tne men met.
and, while they did not wrap themselves
in each other's embraces or shed tears at
parting, there was a general love feast
This may and may not be so, but it is not
believed that Klllilea and Gross, of Mil
waukee. went to Chicago with any idea of
allowing the Johnsonians to rub the Mex
lean salve on them so thick that they
would give up their American League fran
chise without a struggle. St. Louis parties
desired to buv the Milwaukee franchise.
but the Brewers wanted SiO.uoo for it in
order to make even on losses, which made
the St. Louis prospective buyers return to
the tunnel. In order to keep peace Matt
Klllilea and Gross decided to mine their
bag. baggage and entire outfit to St. Louis
to pitch camp early next spring.
By invading St. LouU the American
League will be established next year In
four cities where National League clubs are
located Boston, Philadelphia, Chicago and
St. Louis and it is plainly seen that the
talk of a compromise that emanated in
Chicago last fall is more distant than ever.
The American League will also go after
holidav dates, and will schedule the best
of them In cities where the National
League will play. The outcome; of the
whole business is a matter that cannot be
conjectured at this time.
xxx
The meeting of the National League this
month will be interesting, and the baseball
world will soon learn just what steps the
major organization will take to retain what
little prestige it still holds, and what meth
ods will be pursued, If any, to recover lost
ground. The war last season between the
two big Leagues was costly, and the Na
tional League clubs had to b-ar the large
part of the exponso. With opposition In
another cltv the coming seat on there
will be surely "something doing." and the
National League fathers may have to dig
deeper. The National league ten-year
agreement expired this fail, ami when the
League Is reorganized there may be steps
taken to fight the American League in a
manner that may accomplish results. Man!
baseball men stiil believe that had John f.
Rogers, of Philadelphia, been banished
to an Island during the summer of 19V
the American Association, as plann d bi
W. II. Watkins. to include the big Easter a
cities and act as an ally to the NationpV
League, would have prevcntesl the Amer
lean League from invading the Easter
cities and would have driven it to the wal'$
Rogers, however, prevented Watkins anS
his colleagues from entering r-hiladeipht4
with the result that the American Leagu?
secured a foundation in that city built upo
rock and not upon sand. Getting into Phi
adelphia enabled the Johnson crowd to g5
into other Bastern cities, with the result
that is well known.
XXX '
It would be a hard matter for the Na
tlonal League to get rid of Rogers, of
Philadelphia, although there would be n:i
tears shed if he would be ousted. But th
chances are that he will not sell out, an
If some one else would be given the Nn
tional League franchise in Philadelphia
when the League meets to reorganize h'-
would join the American League rank
and there would be no suitable place fo:
the National League to place a team iC
the Quaker Citv. There is a wonderful
absence of news from the East in National
League circhs. and baseball men are won;
dering Just what will be sprung at th
meeting in New York next Tuesday. Thery
will probably be no compromise betwert
the National and American leagues thli
year, as It looks as if Johnson s crowd
does not care to compromise. The Ameri:
can League is on an equal footing now;
and should a compromise be effected at
the close of next reason it is more than
possible that Johnson and his colleagues
will be able to name their own termr.
They are In some of the best cities now:
and it is safe to say that they will not
give them up to the National League unj
less there is an equal division of the bes-.
territory.
XXX t
It is said that President Hart, of th.J
Chicago National League club, will go be
fore the meeting next Tuesday prepared to
fight for peace between the two organizar
tlons. Just how much weight his plear?
will have will be seen later, but it is not
believed that there will be any compro
mise made this year. The National Leanuv
is whipped now, but it will likely wait until
the American League has made a better
job of it and will then have to accept tne
American's terms of compromise.
XXX
The American League has already prom
ised not to tamper with men who have
signed American Association contracts
This agreement has already been jostleef
by the new St. Louis American Leaguo
team by signing Pitcher Dunham with
Dayton last year. Bryce, of the Columbuf
vmencan Association team, claims he has
Dunham's signed contract to play in Co
lumbus. If he can show the contract 11
is believed that St. Louis will have to re
linquish claim to him or demonstrate that
Johnson's rule was not made in true faiths
XXX
The American Association Is threatened
with opposition In Kansas City, as James
Manning, who lost his money in Washing
ton in the American League last year and
was practically dumped by that organiza
tion, as Johnson cares nothing for men
who "have no money, says he will place a
Western League team in Kansas City.
The American Association will not give
up Kansas City, and neither will It re
linquish claim on Omaha. Both are good
cities for the new organization, and it
would be foolish to get out of them.
Rourke, of Omaha, who has a whole lot to
learn in baseball, claim? that he will give
up his American Association franchise and
go to the Western League. If President
Hickey still retains Rourke's $500 guarantee
to stay in the American Association it Is
likely that Rourke will change his mind
and remain in the new organization.

that his doctors forbade him to leave his

took Schaeffer's place, and, though Barutel
played brilliantly, Slosson won by a score
of 400 to 3G0. In order to fill up the schedule
Schaeffer will have to play In the last thre

After a. Flht Hin Gosalp.
James J. Corbett Is a hellerer In a nw
method of governing the way in which a
fighter can gain the honor of champloa.
During his engagement in Indianapolis last
wevk he talked freely about men who haves
gained the championship in various classes
rnd how it has been lost by chance blows.
"Take Terry Mc(5overn, for instance," eald
Corbett, "and you will have an example of
how a fighter has met every man in his
class and easily defeated them, only to lose
to another fighter in more or less of a lucky
fight for his opponent. In losing the battle
McGovern also lost the championship and
Young Corbett is now credited with being
the featherweight champion. I do not want
to detract from Young Corbett's great vic
tory, but it does seem to me that he should
not be entitled to the honor of champion.
In my opinion a fighter h'-uld win at least
three out of five hghts from the best smtn
in his class before he can b called cham
pion, and lose as many before he relin
quishes the title. In other words, McGov
ern should be the champion until at least
two more men have defeated him, or until
Young; Corbett has won from him again,
and in that event he will lose the title. On
the other Ivand, Young Corbett should hav
to defeat Dave Sullivan and one other good
man In the class K-fjre he is really th
champion. There have been many nghtd
lost in the history of the prize ring by
champions who were knocked out by a
chance blow, although they outgeneraled
and outpointed the opponent. Take the fight
in Chicago in 1VW, between McCoy and Jack
McCormiek, of Philadelphia. Everybody
knew that McCoy was the better fighter,
but McCormiek made a wild swing and
knocked McCoy out. Later McCoy mad
McCormiek look like a poor penny. Had
the first fight been a championship battl
McCoy woukl have lost Cie title because a
man not as good as him Had hapjetied to
swing wildly and land. It is not right and
there should be a revision of the rules gov
erning the manner of winning a champion
ship."
Corbett is a great believer in science. He
is the most scientific boxer the fistic world
has ever produced and he wants to get
back into the ring. Talking of the fighters
of this time and what they were ten or
twelve years ago, he said: "Ten or twelve
years ago there were but three men in
the heavy-weight class who were good
fighters Sullivan. Mitchell and Kllrain.
It was a hard thing for one of them to
get a fight, but look at the difference now.
There are Jeffries, Ruhlin. McCoy, Shark
ey, Maher, Fltzslmmons and myself who
are able to give any other heavy weight
a good argument. If a man in that class
goes around the country agreeing to put
any man out in four rounds or wants a
fight he is sure to be quickly accommo
dated. The fighters now are 50 per cent,
better than they were when Sullivan was
In his prime. Now they are more scien
tific and know how to box and there are
any number who can go into the ring
and put up a good stiff bout. The same
thing holds good In other classes. Cham
pions in all classes can find mn who are
willing to give them a battle if they will
only sign articles."
XXX
Tom Sharkey Is tired of waiting for a
chance to fight Jeffries for the heavy
weight championship, and the sailor has
decided to force the issue for the purposo
of finding out whether or not the cham
pion is sincere In his desire to give him a
return match In the near future. Sharkey
has posted $2.5J In Nek York as a guar
antee of his good Intentions and to bind
the match if Jeffrie will accept. Sharkey
has also posted an additional 12.500 em be
half of Dave Sullivan to bind a match
with Young Corbett. the feather-weight
champion. Both fighters are anxious to
battle for championship honors, and all
that remains to clinch a match li for Jef
fries and Corbett to cover the forfeit.
One of the hardest fight? that James J.
Cor'ott ever hail In his life does not appear
in the hook of records of pugllsts. It Is
probably because the fight eccurred when
he was about seven een years old and had
not then entered the prize ring as a full
fledged pugilist. While discussing ancient
history and battles in which he was en
gaged Corbett told of the encounter while
talking with a few friends in Indianapolis
last week.
"My hardest and bloodiest fight occurred
when I was a mere kid. about seventeen
years old. My opponent was Je Choyn
skl. who later grew into prominence tho
same as I old. The fight was held on a
barge in the bay n-ar Sin Francisco It
was a terribly hot day. and it' was arranged
that we should l-gin hostilities early in
the morning, in th center of the barge
was erected a small house. There was
quite a crowd on the barge, and when we.
stripped for the fijtht I had three-ounce
gloves and Choynskl borrow 1 a pair of
common driving gloves from a man and cut
off the fingers.
"The rope was stretched and we entered
the ring. From tne time the word was '
Vi ven we slugged hard. The Min beat down
upon ux with all the fury that Old S.d euld
concentrate upon two lads who were bat
tling for fistic honors. We were getting
blistered from the hot sun when I not let 1
llu.t the little chanty en the lr;e :it a-
shadow In the rin;;. I fought around th
ring until I could get in that shadow. It
was a great relief, and I fared better than
Choynksl, who was forced to stay in the
sun. As the fight progressed and round
after round was fought 1 always man;ird
to get Into that shadow. There were places
o:i my face where he had struck me and
th senms on the driving gloves he wore
tore the fiesh. We knocked each othr
down time and asaln and we showed the
effects of the terrible encounter. Aft r I
had enjoyed a monopoly of th" few square
feet of shadow In the rln;r for awhile It
seemed that Choynksl saw the advantage I
had. He made hi way to th shrtdow and
we fought harder to gain that place of
vantage that we u at any i.thr time dur
ing the ficht, lit- was the first to r.t Into
the shelter from the sun. and I was deter
mined that he should rjet out. I aimed a

squarely, but I evidently Injured a nerve In
my arm in landing the blow. f..r there was
a fearful pain in my wrist that ran up to
the should' r. I thought I should faint and
evidently acted queerly. The crowd alMt-.it

tiuth I was atw.vit to faint. One of the
young fellows that acted as a second for
Choynski fir.t notb-ed my veakerd condi
