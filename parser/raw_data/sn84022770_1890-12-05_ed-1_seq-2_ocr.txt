Senator Culloni's recent statement
that the McKinley tariff will have to
be modified by the present Congress is
significant Ti.at the Senator voiced
the si ntlinents of a great many Re
publicans cannot be disputed; never
theless, it is not expected that the
committee on rules of the House of
Representatives, which controls the
business of that body, and which is in
turn controlled by Messrs. Reed, Can
non and McKinley, its Republican
members, will allow anything which
has even tie slightest tendency in
that direction to get before tlie House.
THE death of Hon. August lielmont
deprives tin-eoiiiitry of an able man
and the Democratic party of one of its
brightest members. For twelve years
from IBfio to 1872, be was chairman of
the National Democratic Committee,
and although the three national cam
paigns which lie managed were practi
cally hopeless from the start, lie per
formed his arduous duties as consci
entiously as if there had been a rea
sonable prospect for victory before
him. Ho was horn in Germany, but
no native American surpassed him in
devotion to American institutions.
THE main topics discussed in the
President's message are given in this
issue of the STANDARD. AS opinions
of the Chief Executive, they are wor
thy of consideration, hut viewed from
any other standpoint, would hardly be
classed with mediocrity. The apolo
getic tone of the paper is in marked
contrast with the hold, aggressive
opinions of his predecessor. If Ben
has had a chan-e of renoiniuation by
his party, it is gone now.
As if there was not already enough
quarreling among the managers of the
World's Fair, the lady managers have
entered the lists as active competitors
of the long-tongued males. The coun
try has had quite enough of this sort
of tiling, and if the present managers,
male and female, cannot utilize their
time la-tier than they have been do
ing there should he a movement
started for an entire new set of man
agers.
IT is nonsense, pure and simple, to
expect, in this age of progress, that
the people would he willing to dis
pense with the carrying of the mails
on Sunday; it would inconvenience
and discommode thousands for every
one that would lie benefitted by stop
ping Sunday mail trains. The world
goes forward, not backward, in this,
the evening of the nineteenth century.
THERE is food for thought in the
fact that the entire railway system of
the country, west of the Mississippi
river, is now controlled by the Gould's,
Vandcrhilt's and Rockfeller's. It is
just this sort of monopoly that in
creases the membership of the Farm
ers' Alliance and kindred organiza
tions.
TIIE Knights of Labor have endorsed
Wannamaker's postal telegraph idea,
which will not be of the slightest ben
efit to the masses, but of one cent let
ter postage, which would benefit every
body, they have not a word to say.
Surely there is a screw loose.
THERE is a disagreeable sound to
Democratic cars in the proclamation
issued by the Queen Regent declaring
Princess Wilhelmine, Queen of the
Netherlands. How much longer -will
the people of Europe allow this royal
farce to continue?
IF you don't believe that the Re
publican Administration and Con
gress have been expensive luxuries
just compare the present condition of
the National Treasury with what it
was March 4, 1889, and you will be
convinced.
UNDER the apportionent bill intro
duced by Representative Frank, of
Missouri, Washington and Oregon each
will have an additional member. The
number is fixed at 356, or 24 more
than the membership of the pres
ent House.
IF the Republicans bad worked as
iard for the success of their party in
he recent campaign as they are now
■loing to stir up discord in the Demo
• ratic party they would have made a
nuch better showing.
THERE is one thing which is abso
utely true concerning ex-President
'leveland and Governor Hill: they will
•otli heartily support the ticket norai
i.atcd by the Democratic national
onvention in 1892.
THE Chinese government likes the
nlver law adopted by the last Congress.
I bis fact is mentioned because of its
novelty, and also because there is such
i general dislike expressed towards it
iu this country.
IF the Dakota Indians attempt to

LADIES' RELIEF SOCIETY.
Report of Its Corresponding Secretary.
'/'<> t!if titJh'i* otiil Moulin rs i'f lJt<
As .-i i rtlary, I submit to you a
Lrief r« port of the ullicial proceedings
of tlie s .eiety for the li-cal year end
ing Ihvt niher 1 st.
At the present date, roll-call shows
a membership of 21) and while onr '
numhers may seein small, yet when
taking into account the population of
the , ity and the number of public in
stitutions to support, and considering
that this l.- the youngest, we compare
well and should take encouragement
remembering that it is not through
members alone that success is as
sured.
The membership is im reasii g slow
ly ii t surely. This is an institution
with a broad platform that has for its
watchword universal good will; a place
where philanthropists congregate in
the interests of humanity, where
Christian graces and the better audi
nobler sentiments of the heart rise;
above sect, and worship at the altar of!
charity and benevolence, and broad-!
minded women will lend their sup- i
,1-rt;
While there seems to be no lack of!
j interest, yet it would be gratifying if j
there were a more general attendance ;
: of the members at the regular monthly j
lneetings, without which a correct
knowledge ol the business and work
ings of the society cannot he obtained.
Each member, whether otficcr or not,
has a place of importance to fill and a
part to jierform which no other can
! successfully accomplish.
The society has given three public
halls and has, in trust, one lot in real
estate purchased at a cost of $250.
Papers of incorporation drawn up un
der the laws of the State are ready to
j lie tiled. The amount of funds re
ceived during the year and paid to the
Treasurer amounts to $4(59.25. On
investigating the property depart
ments, 1 find a small amount of cloth
j ing iu possession of the society. Quite
an amount has been donated during
the term which wasimmediately distrib
uted by the Investigating Committee.
Articles of furniture have been prof
fered the society quite frequently to
wards furnishing a •' Home" but were
not accepted on account of alack of
'; storage room.
In every instance, the society lias
responded to the calls of the needy
and by examining the records I find
, that thirteen families, representing 41
individuals, have been visited and re
lieved according to their wants and
' necessities.
Special donations in cash have been
received in varied amounts and from
various individuals. Among those
most worthy of mention is Miss Mary
Blackler, who exceeds all others in
amount, and G. Kaufman, Esq., who
in commemoration of the 25tli anni
versary of his wedding replenished our
treasury with a generous cash deposit.
We trust the society has passed its
most critical period. Like all things
regulated by the laws of time, it had
to have a beginning, and organized
somewhat prematurely perhaps, nt a
time when the affairs of the city and
State were in an unsettled condition.
It has been held between extremes,
and being a ward of the public it lias
been caressed, criticised and ad
monished by its uncles, its aunts and
its cousins, and when the people real
ize that the Ladies' Relief Society is
growing in stature and has come to
stay, and our tiroad-niinded men un
derstand that it is comprised of broad
minded women, with stability of pur
pose, we trust they will see that ad
vice and criticism publicly adminis
tered does not pass for currency or add
to the social or financial status of the
society. So far, our scope has been
limited and our plans of work ini
matured for lack of means. To
establish a home for the friend
less has been the underlying pur
poses of this institution, and while
we are making honest efforts to that
end to relieve the immediate wants of
the worthy poor is our desire, and if
during these two years of united effort
on the port of a few earnest women,
temporal comfort mingled with the
milk of human kindness has blessed
any home or cheered any heart in the
toilsome journey of life, then the La
dies' Relief Society has not lived or
labored in vain, and will endeavor to
honorably fill its place and perform
that part that would otherwise be left
undone—the part of woman.
To the press of the city, especially J
do we owe acknowledgment for favors
innumerable and graciously bestowed,
while the musicians of the ci'y we
hold in the highest appreciation for
services so generously rendered. To
the City Council which has furnished
us their room as a place of meeting,
free of charge, and to the city officers
we express our gratitude. We also
feel that apropos to the occasion is
an acknowledgement to the public
for its generous patronage on toe oc
casion of our late Thanksgiving ball,
to Mr. and Mrs. Mason whose genial
hospitality added much to the social
success of the evening, to the Olympia
Orchestral Union and to Mrs. O. R.
Simenson, whose beautiful floral ar
rangement and sale of buttonnaires
added materally to the financial suc
cess of the occasion. Where favors are
so numerous it would be useless to try
to thank personally each one who has
assisted us, but ask each and all who
have aided us in our work or en
couraged our cause, to accept our sin
cere gratitude.
Respectfully submitted.

Recording Secretary.
THE newly-found valley, that lies
just above Gray's river falls, is attract
ing considerable attention. By kcep
ing to the south bank of the river, in
gress can be made without much diffi
culty. The more fully explored the
valley is, the more valuuble it seems
to become. It is estimated that it is
at least three miles wide. The beach
lands are very extensive in their area,
and are susceptible of a high state of
cultivation. It is calculated there is
abundant room for 100 or more fami
lies to settle and make comfortable
homes. A portion of this new-found
valley is located in Pacific county,
which lies to the north of Wahkiakum.
Louis Bannon, an itinerant tailor of
Spokane Falls, has flown with a num

was among the number left out in the

contracts to put linings in a number

time in the city. He has gone, and
with him several hundred dollars'
worth of overcoats.

OUR WASHINGTON LETTER.
K> .ular i urr< *powl< net of ;ln -•ainlaril.
W \miini;T'>N. D. C., Nov. 2*. W : ".
Mr. Harrison. Speaker Reed, Repre
sentative Mi Kinky and all the ether
Republican advoeates for a continua
tion at the short session of Congress of
the radical programme begun at the
last scs.-ion, arc going through a panic
just now. They fear that there will
not be a Republican quorum present
in the House before Christmas, and
that it will l e impossible to compel
many of the Republicans who have
been defeated to attend the n. ssion
regularly, and without a Republican
quorum they know that their game is
blocked, as the Democrats are fully de
termined that no political apportion-'
ment shall he made, unless it he done
by Republican votes entirely; and the
same thing holds good regarding the
notorious subsidy shipping bills.
The Democratic leaders have node
sire to see an extra se--ioii of Congress
in the Spring, and if there be one, i
which now stems altogether probable,
it will he the fault of the Republicans.:
The Democrats arc ready and willing
to aid in passing the regular appropria- 1
tion hills for the support of the Govern
ment, but they propose resisting to the
last extremity any attempt to pass
party legislation.
It is specially pleasing to the Demo
crats to learn that it has been decided
! by bosses Reed, McKinley and Cannon,
whose control of the House committee
on littles makes them absolute dictat
ors of the business to come before the
11 ottsc, that the tariff law shall not be
modified or amended at this session.
It was feared that the Republicans
would be sensible enough at the com
ing session to get back the votes they
lost, by revising the objectionable fea
tures, and there are few that are not
objectionable of the new tariff law in a
business manner. Rut they liaveeleet
ed to stand or fall by the new law,
which makes their fall certain when
the people again get a whack at them
in 18'J2.
A semi-oflicial announcement has
been made by Mr. McKinley that no
silver or other financial legislation
would be passed this winter. The cry
of the agriculturist, voiced by the heavy
vote of the Farmers' Alliance, for finan
cial relief, is to be ignored until the
Democratic House comes in. Secretary
Windom will, I am informed, propose
in bis annual report a relief in the
shape of 1$ and 2 per cent bonds to be
issued by the Government, to be con
vertible into cash upon demand of the
bolder—this idea is borrowed from the
old greenback party—but of course it
will require Congressional legislation
before they could be issued, and if Mr.
McKinley spoke by the card, and the
presumption is that lie did, Mr. Win
dow's recommendation will be good for
nothing.
Ex-Representative Warner, who was
here all last session as air advocate of
silver legislation says the silver men
will submit three propositions to Con
gress—first, free coinage; second, free
coinage limited to silver protluced in
this country until France and Germany
shall buy American silver; third, the
coinage of about $20,000,000 to equal
the amount of national bank notes re
tired during tlie last year—and that
they will leave no stone unturned to
get one of them passed. Either of
them could be passed if a vote could be
bad upon tliem, but bow the House
can pass a bill which the committee on
Rules refuses to allow it to consider, I
cannot see.
One lias only to circulate among the
leading Democratic members of Con
gress now here to discover what a bro
ken reed the Republicans are leaning
upon in expecting that Democratic
mistakes in the next House are to give
them an opportunity of winning in
1892. Present indications nre that
there will be no Democratic mistakes,
at least not serious ones. The Demo
cratic programme will be, first of all, to
give tlie people more money by provid
ing for tlie free coinage of silver, and
to revise the tariff in a way that will
reduce the prices of clothing and agri
cultural supplies and implements, and
at the same time give the farmer prac
tical reciprocity by enlarging the mar
ket for the sale of their supplies. No
mistakes in a programme cf that sort,
is there? The Democrats propose to
confine themselves to legislating for
the people; that is all classes, and not
for a few favored individuals.
Nearly all of the gentlemen who
have announced themselves as candi
dates or who have been placed in nont
• ination by their friends for the Speak
-1 ership of the next House nre now here,
■ and they are one and all greatly sur
! prised to learn of the bitter tight each
and every one of them is making, in
| the newspapers, for tlie coveted honor
1 and it is the source of no little amuse
- ment among them.
' Mr. Harrison's aununl message ti
1 Congress will, according to a gentle
1 man who ought to km w whereof In
1 speaks, be confined to an appeal to tin
Republicans to stand by protection ai
' exemplified in the McKinley law, tc
pass an apportionment bill, a Fcdera
election bill and the steamship subsidi
1 bills, and not to pass any silver legisla
- tion. DEM.
The Union Pacific.
In a New York despatch dated on
the 28th ult., Mr. Gould is reported to
have said:
"The Union Pacific has earnings of
$40,000,000 a year, and its terminals
ure estimated by the congressional
commission to be worth at least $15,-
000,'000. I should not have gone into
the management again if I had not
known we had something to bank on.
" Adams' statement about harmony
during his administration is not wholly
correct. The fact is, the directors
really know very little about what the
president was doing. There is a piece
of road out in Utah graded and ready
for rails, and although it is 150 miles
long, its directors know nothing about
it. There is another piece, eighty
miles long, in Southern Kansas, on
which I believe, rails are laid and that
does not connect anywhere with the
Union Pacific system, and the direct
ors were surprised to know of the
company building it.
" With this and the purchase of the
Oregon Railway & Navigation com
pany, which I think was a wise one,
considerable of a floating debt was
caused, but it can te easily handled.
"The additional thousands of names
added to the pay roll is a mystery and
not explained.
"A change in the management of
the Union Pacific insures harmony
among western railways.
" Instead of great paraphernalia of
agents and solicitors, the association
will have central agencies in large
cities and freight rates will be executed
under the direction of a commissioner
chesen by the association.
" A meeting of western railroad offi
cials will be held very soon, probably
next week, but the certainty that such i
an association will be formed has had!
a good effect."
. In regard to the general financial
situation Gould reiterated the asser
tion that the most serious trouble was
passed. The trusts in stocks, sugar,
whisky, lead and things of that kind,
produced much of the trouble. In his
opinion, the public lost money by
them, and consequently lost confidence
in everything in Wall street. These
stocks had same merit, but companies
were organized in the wrong way.
On to-morrow the Tribune will pub
lish a long interview with Jay Gould,
in which he says ex-President* Adams,
of the Union Pacific, conducted many
affairs of the Union Pacific without
the knowledge of the directors. Gould 1
s:»i-l lie 1< ariicil wlit-n la.-t in Kansas
<"ity, that Adams personally owned
the control of the stock yards there,
and while the railroad was carrying
in their live stock at the hare cost of'
transportaion, the stock yards earned
one million dollars the past year.
Such action as this, Could said, would
never he permitted under the new
management.
He believes the Burlington and the'
Rock Island will both come in for se
curing better results from western
railway business. No further changes,
he said, were to be made in the Union
Pacific.
It is evident the Gould-Sage party
did not enjoy the farewell address of
President Adams. Sage, in an inter
view. said :
" The tenor of Adams' address was
almost uncalled for. There has been
no public criticism of his management
by any of the directors, notwithstand
ing the fact he was running the road
to ruin. Mr. Adams says in his ad
dress he has been president seven years
and during that time the action of the
directors was unanimous. That is
simply saying that Adams it responsi
ble for the Union Pacific's condition.
He should explain how it comes that
the pay roll has increased four thou
j sand names in nine months, and what
I personal interest he had in the Kansas
| smelting works, in favor of which dis
crimination was made in rates for
I shipping bullion, and a half-dozen
other matters."
A Country Worth Looking After.
A bill providing for the exploration
of Alaska and appropriating •tIOO.UUU
for that purpose has been placed on
the calendar of the House of Repres
entatives. By the provisions of this
bill a detail from the army is to be
stationed in the interior of the Terri
tory and there retained for such length
of time as will enable the same to be
thoroughly explored and its mineral
and other natural resources ascertain
ed, as far as may be. This bill ought
to be enacted into a law as soon as
possible.
While the exploration of most other
portions of the public domain may be
left to be effected by private enterprise,
I this will not do with Alaska. With
its rigorous climate, long winters, and
short summers, with its mountains,
morasses and rivers, its extent and re
moteness, neither individuals or small
parties, nor yet large companies, are
equal to the task of exploring this vast
and gloomy region. This is a business
that will even severely task the re
sources of the General Government,
if it is to be soon accomplished and
with much thoroughness.
The work is one of great difficulty
and appauling magnitude. The cli
mate and conditions throughout are
about as bad as they well can be. The
weather is more or less stormy most
jof the year, frequent and heavy rains
in the summer and deep snow falls
during a good part of the other months.
The cold is intense, ice forming on the
lakes and all but the larger streams to
a great thickness. The distances to
be traversed are frightful to contem
plate. The Pribyloff Islands, the cen
ter of the seal fisheries, lie 600 miles
to the westward of the Alaska Penin
sula, which in turn is a thousand miles
west of the long coast strip, site of the
gold mines now being worked. But
this strip, though nearly a thousand
miles long and comprises an area
larger than all the New Eaglaud
States, constitutes a mere outlying
fragment of the main Territory.
The distant province is becoming an
important portion of the republic.
The exports for the past vear amount
ed to 110,000,000, $2,000,(XX) of which
were gold. The output of the mines
will lie likely to increase rapidly here
after, co.il, lead and copper coming in
to supplement the product of the pre
cious metals. After a time lumber will
be exported and possibly ice, the cur
ing and canning of iisli expanding
meantime into an immense indus
try.
In view of such probable growth,
the boundary line between thin coun
try and British Columbia should be
ascertained and fixed as soon as prac
ticable. A regular form of govern
ment should also be provided for the
Territory, to the end that the inhabit
ants be enable to enact such local
laws as may be needed and otherwise
manage their home affairs. Alaska is
worth looking after and should in 110
vital particulars be neglected by the
General Government.
A RAILROAD to Alaska is one of the
sure things of the near future. The
latest information in this direction is
that arrangements have been conclud
ed and capital raised by n syndicate of
St. Petersburg, Kusssia, capitalists and
some promiuent New York railway
magnates, among whom are Henry
Villard, to build a railroad from Puget
Sound to Alaska. There have been
many wild transpacific and transatlan
tic schemes, such as bridging Behring
straits and establishing a steamship
line to Eurojte from Hudson's Bay; yet
none a few years ago appeared more
chimerical than the proposition to
build a paying railway through the fro
zen wastes of Alaska. But now con
siderable interest is manifested in
schemes of this kind. Alaska has
many enthusiastic admirers who look
on it as the coming land of wealth and
promise. What Jay Cooke did in
booming the Lake Superior country,
Villard and his friends propose to do
for Alaska. Engineering parties have
been in the field all summer, and it is
expected that the line will IKJ located
next spring. The company lias a cap
ital of $1,500,000.
As J. M. Kincaid, of Palonse City,
was loading some hogs to he shipped
to Spokane, one day lust week, a young
man stood by watching him, and in
reply to a few questions, learned the
name of Mr. Kincaid and the firm to
whom the hogs were shipped. The
youug man went to Spokane on the
same train and took the hogs, made
straight for the firm receiving them,
and introduced himself as being in the
employ of Mr. Kincaid and presented
ah or«ler for $54, purporting to be from
Mr. Kincaid, which he claimed was
due to him for wages. He received
the money. A clerk who was familiar
with Mr. Kincaid's signature chanced
to look over the order after the scala
wag had gone, and pronounced it a
forgery, which was confirmed hv a con
versation over the wire. Mr. kincaid
went to Spokane, and succeeded in
having the forger captured and com
mitted to jail.
