G. N. BUFFET
IS CLOSED
Great Northern Dining Cars Will
Permit No More Sale of Liq
uor While at Willmar.
Thanks to activity of Sheriff Bon
de, the buffet cars on the Great
Northern tracks will not hereafter
dispense intoxicating drinks while
in the city of Willmar.
K«/# T%-
A short time ago word was given
the sheriff that the buffet car that
arrives from St. Paul at 10:50 and
remains at the depot until 12:01 a.
m., when it is taken out on the
Sioux City train, was proving pop
ular with the thirsty individuals of
our city. Last Tuesday night, Dec
3, the sheriff with his friend Chief
of Police Gilbertson, both in citi
zens' clothes, boarded the car and
the sheriff stood the treat. The
buffet man handed each about a
thimbleful of whisky, which they
drank. Not satisfied with this, the
sheriff ordered two bottles of beer
to take with him. These were of
a diminutive size, and the sheriff
felt that he had been robbed when
the man asked a dollar for the pur
chases. However small the doses
were, they were sufficient for the
purposes of the sheriff. He secured
the proper papers for the arrest of
his man and on Saturday morning
boarded the train on which this
man was working, thinking best
not to molest him while on duty.
As the porter, whose name is Albert
Rathstock, stepped from the train
at St. Paul, Sheriff Bonde took
charge of him. They called at the
office of the Superintendent of the
dining car service, and the sheriff
explained why he was constrained
to relieve the service of one of its
assistants. The superintendent was
amazed, and assured the sheriff that
no infraction of the law had been
authorized from headquarters. He
wanted the sheriff to wait until the
legal department could be communi
cated with, but the sheriff said that
he wanted to catch the morning
train back to Willmar and the legal
department might arrange to ap
pear at Willmar.. The superintend
ent assured the sheriff that the
buffet would be closed hereafter
while within the limits of Willmar,
and that the offense would not be
committed again.
The department communicated to
their local attorney, Samuel Proter,
to appear for the man. The case
was brought under the city ordin
ance before Judge Muller of the
municipal court Saturday after
noon. The man was adjudged guil
ty, having made no defense, and
was assessed a fine of $50.00 and
cost*!, which amounted in all to
$78.14, and was promptly paid.

ACQUITTED OF
MANSLAUGHTER
Second Trial of Anton Brogren
ol New London Results in
an Acquittal.
The*friends of the Brogren fami
ly of New London are rejoicing over
the fact that Anton comes back
from Minneapolis this week a free
man. The jury in the second trial
was out less than half an hour be
fore agreeing on a verdict of ac
quittal. The first trial held early
last summer resulted in a disagree
ment. The young man and his
family have been in great suspense
for some time. The boy has been
out on bail and during the last
month or more has been required
to come to Minneapolis very often
in anticipation of his trial coming
on. Finally the State's attorney
moved to dismiss the case, but the
judge would not have it so, and or
dered the case to be tried. The
Minneapolis Journal contained the
following report of the case:
"Anton Brogren, who admitted
that he shot and killed John Hart
Engstrom, a saloon keeper, but who
asserted that he had been made the
victim of knockout drops and that
he was not responsible for his action,
is not guilty of manslaughter in
connection with Engstrom's death.
The jury in the case returned a ver
dict of not guilty at noon today.
"Engstrom was shot in his sa
loon, 124 Second street S., on the
night of April 9. Brogren had
been ejected from the saloon twice
and shot the saloon keeper as he
was being ejected the third time.
His attorney, A. T. Grotte, argued
that he had been drugged and
"rolled" in the Second street dis
trict.
"Brogren bore a good reputation,
and it was shown that he was not
addicted to the use of intoxicants.
The first trial resulted in a disa
greement.
The boy's father, P. A. Brogren,
a hard-working tailor of New Lon
don, has labored incessantly to as
sist his boy in his trouble. It has
cost him* much money and great
