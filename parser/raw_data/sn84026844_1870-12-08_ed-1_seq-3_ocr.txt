We, the "committee appointed by tbc
tizem of Hopcdalo and vicinity for tin
urposc of procuring the right of way oik
ibscriptions to build u railroad Irom tlx
ity of Wheeling, W. Vn., via Short Creel
id Piuey Fork to llopedale; thence wesl
a my of the branches ol the Stillwutci
r fonotton to tho northwest, ask tc
lake in tbc columns of your |iapcr tin
illowlng brief report of Mr. Blicknesder
t'b reports of preliminary surveys. Ont
us made by him in 1840, via Cadiz, cal
d the Central Valley route; the othci
lade by him In September, 1870 con
sctlng his old survey at tho mouth of Pi'
ay Fork via llopedale, to an Intersection
ith the Cadiz branch, connecting with
te lino ot the P. C. and St. L. ft. H.
lowing the advantages of the llopedale
lute over tho Short Creole or any other
iat has yet been surveyed, and giving
10 people a fair understanding, us tlx
udiz press bus entirely ignored, ub and
[variably publishes such communication!
i bear on the Short Creek route, bul
jbllshes only what they think best subirves
their own interest, and bus refused
> publish such arguments as we advanced
i prove our assertions. On page 2 ol the
inted report of Mr. Blickensderfer's old
iport will be found tho following; "Id
issing up the valley of Little Stillwater,
3 difficulty of moment is encountered
Hween Urichsvillo anil the point where
>o line begins to ascend the summit, and
te route is one which permits the conruction
of a roud ut a comparatively
nail expense." This much of the route,
I miles, (Lacyville) is llopedale route,
rbence, after passing several deep runes,
Anally pierces the ridge by a tunnel
' 1200 yards in length." On page 3:
he most expensive works on this part ol
e lino will be several high embankcnts,
on the west side of tbc ridge, the
nnel and the deep cuttings at its ends,
i crossing the valley ol Standing Stoue,
low Thompson's Mill, un embankment
trying from 18 to 40 feet in heigbth, und
lout 1400 feet long will be required, and
crossing the ravine ut McFudden s unber
embankment, averaging about 44
I liiirli und 1400 foot lonir will bo ncc
snry. Tho extreme depth of the cutigs
ut the ends ol the tunnel will be
lout 40 feet. On the oast side this cutig
will run out at 8000 feet from the end
the tunnel, mid on the went side ut
00. On page 4: From the castesn end
' the summit division, near Warfield's
ill, the line continues down
lort Creek, and meets with no
istructions until within 4a short
stance of tho junction of the two
anches near Ilaga's mill. Ilere the
eek winds for about three-fourths of n
ile through a nnrrow defile between
jh In'lit, where mine inconvenience will be
ipcricnccd in introducing proper curves,
pretty close examination of this part ol
e line shows, however, that no curve ol
ss than 000 feet radius need be made,
id on a final location they may perhaps
1 lengthened. From this point to the
bio river 110 serious obstruction is met
ith. Hut the confined anil winding nitre
of the mlley rentiers it necamry frelentty
to emu the stream (bridges) anil in
11111/ instances the road must be built in
.0 bed of the crcek, requiring considcrac
expenditure for stone protection and
ipe wall, on page 7." In the event of a
lal location of u road in thu Valley ol
jort Crcek, Mr. Blickcnsderfer suggests
10 other tunnels bclore the line reaches
0 mouth of l'iucy Fork. This makes
0 report between the mouth of Clear
jrk and the mouth of Piucy Fork. The
port makes the balance of the routo cxedingly
tavorabie for building a ruiliad?there
being but two bridges from
e mouth of Pincy Fork to tho river, one
-cr the main creek and one over Little
art Crcek, a. distance of six miles,
he-following Is a partial report of Mr.
Ilckcnsderfor's report of the preliminary
rvcy made by liini in September, 1870,
' the connecting link tin Iiopedale to the
idiz Branch: "For the first ilj miles the
illey of Pincy Fork is quite easy, and no
fllculty is met with requiring unusual
itlay in thu construction of a railway,
ime cutting will be required in the next
ro or three miles, making the work somehat
difficult and expensive. Jt will be
und necessary to tunnel through u long
int projecting so much across tho generdircction
of the valley that the line
uld not be turned. Fortunately the
int is so narrow and abrupt that a tun1
of only 150 feet in length will be relircd,
with no cutting at one end, the
trance being a vertical rock, and un apoach
of less than 200 feet in length will
necessary at tho other end. By tunlling
this point it was found practicable
pass the entire distance of 2J miles
rough this most confined portion ol
ncy Fork Valley without using any
rve of less thou 0.55 feet radius. Above
s confied part of the valley the work is
mparativeiy light and easy, with no nessity
lor oithcr lieavy work, sharp curves
high grades until we reach a point near
j summit, one mile west of iiopedale.
this point it is necessary to pass tho
ge forming tho divide between the
iters of Piney Fork anil Cross Crcek,
.1 niy impression is that It can best be
sscd by a tunnel piercing it about 80
t below its crest. This elevation can
easily reached from the Piney Fork
illey. By passing the ridge as low as
?ible I have no doubt n better line can
uuiuiiiuu ??wn wi it. tun tun1
would be about 1)50 fret In length,
lasurvcya (of tlic limited time allowed
making them could not develop tbe
1 capacities of this ground, but arc
iindantly sufficient to demonstrate not
ly tbe entire practicability ol the route,
t to give a very good .Idea of its cliarac
and.cost, . I have no hesitation to aay;
that a good line can b<v had from tho
Kith of Piney Fork to an Intersection
tb the Cadiz branch, with curves of not
s than DBS- feet radius. The work in
leral will compare favorably with simr
portions ol any of tho railways runig
inland ia Eastern Ohio, and the ret
of tho survey shows that you can
ito the railway lines in the Ohio river
liey with the Pitt Jlalrglt, Cleveland nod
Louis lines via llopedale, with entire
lllty," or continue westward down
Stillwater to tliu Tuscarawas Valley,
th equal ease and convenience, as your
asure or interests way dictate," Such
the brief outline and comparison lieeen
theso twolldes. The distance from
idgeport to Urichsvllle, tin Cadiz, is
74; diVi llopedale, Ji2?making this
Ito 3( miles the shortest. The amount
tunneling is some six times greater ?n
i Short Creak route than the llopedale
itc, according to the report; also the
ivvfllls mentioned aa west of Cadiz Is
sided by this route, so that the comttees
claim that the resolutions passed
tho meeting at Cadiz, called in tho inest
of the citizens of Harrison county,
ilo, but made tu appear in the interests
the Short Crock rente, are ours, "the
irtcst and roost practicable route to be

The Land Grabbers at Work Again.
\VASliUiOTON, 1). C., DOC. 0.
The lint thing like business to como up
in Congress this session wus a land grab
: scheme. It was a Joint resolution reported
in July to extend the time for the completion
or a raid in Minnesota, and came
, up in the House in regular order as un,
finished business. This is one of those
I cases where a iund grant is in danger of
. being forfeited by the non-complction of
| the rood within the specified time, and
| the arguments advanced in its Eupjxirt by
Mr. Wilson, ot Minnesota, and Mr. Wash|
burn, of Wisconsin, were tho usual ones
, ?hard limes, lulth of the Government, setI
tlements on lands at high prices, necessity
, for the road, etc. It was rather quick
after tho strong language ol the
. President's message to push such
. a bill through, and Messrs. Julian, Ela,
Lawrence and Wood, of New York,
mndc strenuous opposition, Mr. Wood on
! general grounds, and tho others on |ur.
ticular features of the bill as well Mr.
! Ela offered an amendment providing for a
grant of lands to aid the construction of
certain proposed railways in Nuw Harnp,
shire, which would, he said, puss through
I the best granite section in tbe coun ry,
, open up a short route to the seaboard, and
. alford cheap and rapid trunsportaUon for
' good stone to Minnesota, and for good
lumber to New llnnijtthire; lint the MinI
nesota people would not give Ncjv Ifamp,
shire any help. Alter un hour's debate,
the resolution was laid on the table by u
, vote of 81) to tJO. A motion to reconsider
wus lost, and tho matter was temporarily
' disposed of by postponing it until next
| Tuesday after the morning hour, when
there will.be another struggle, the result
of which will probably decide the fate of
any similar propositions. If it were un
out and out new grant, and not involving
other interests, in a peculiar way, it would
have small chance of success.

Hoofland's Gorman Bitters,
A Bitters without ilcikol or Spirit* of uj
Klad,
Is different from alt othors. It is composed of
the pure Juices or vital rBiNoim or Rooti,
IIeeu9, and Barks, (or as medicinally termed,
extract*), the worthless or inert portions of the |
ingredients not being used. Thoreforo, in one
bottlo of tbia Bittera there ia contained aa much
medicinal virtue aa wiii be fonnd in aereral gal*
Ions of ordinary mixture*. The Root*. Ac., naed
in thJa Bitten aro grown in Germany, their vital
principlca extracted in that country by a sciontiflc
Chemist and forwarded to the manufactory
in this citjr, where they aro oompoonded and
bottled. Containing no spirituous Ingredients,
the Bitter* is free from tho objoction* urged
against all others; no dosire for stlinulanta can
be induced from their use, they cannot make
drunkards, and cannot, under any circumstance*,
hare any but a beneficial effect.
Hoofland's German Tonio
Was compounded for those not inclined to extreme
bitters, and is intended for nse in eases
when somo alcoholic stimulant is required in
connection with the Tonic properties of the Bitters.
Bach bottle of the Tonic contains one bottle
of tho Bitters, combined with pure 8akta
Cbux Rum, and flavored in such a manner that
the extreme bitterness of thw Bitters is overcome,
forming a preparation highly agreeable and
pleasant to tho pulatc, and containing the medicinal
virtues of the Bitters. The price of the
Tonic is $l.fiO per bottle, which many persons
think too high. They must take into consideration
that the stimulant used Is guaranteed to be
of apuro quality. A poor article'could bo furnished
at a cheaper price, but is it not better to
pay a little more and have a good article ? A
medicinal preparation should contain none but
the best ingredients, and they who expect to obtain
a cheap compound will most cortainly be
cheated.

DR. J0IIN80N.
Member of tho Royal College of Surgeons, London,
Graduate of ono of the moat eminent Colleges
in tho United States, and tho greater part
of whose life has been spent in the nonpitals ot
Loudon, Paris, Philadelphia and elsewhere, had
effected some of the mo t astonishing cures that
were ever known. Many troubled with rluging in
the head and ears when asleep, great nervousnesa,
being alarmed at sudden sounds, bashful
nous, with frequent blushing, attended somotimes
with derangement of mind, were cured Im
mediately.
TAKE PARTICULAR NOTICE.
Dr. J. addresses all those who have lnjarud
themselves by impropor indulgence and solitary
habits, which ruin both body and mind, unfitting
thuin for either business, study, society or mar*
riwo.
These are some of the aad and melancholy effects
produced by early habita of youth, via:
Weakuess of tho Back and Limbs, Pains in the
Head. Dimness of Sight. Loss of Muscular Power,
Palpitation of thu Heart, Dyspepsia, Nervous Irritability,
Derangement of the Digostive FoncUona,^General
Debility, Symptoma of ConaumpMkntallt?The
fearful effects on the mind are
much to be dreaded. Loss of Memory, Contusion
of Ideas, Depression of Spirits, Evil Forebodings,
Aversion to Society, Self-Distrust, Love of Solitude,
Timidity, Ac., are sorno of the evils produced.
Thousands of persons of all ages can now Judge
what is tho cause of their declining health, losing
their vigor, becoming weak, pale, nervous and
emaciated, having a singular appearance about
tho eyes, Cough, and Symptoms of Consumption.
YOUNG MEN
wuouaveinjurea themselves by a curtain practice,
indulged in when alone, a habit frequently
learned from evil companions, or at school, tho
effects or which aro nightly felt, even when
asleep, and. if not cured, renders marrlago Impossible,
and destroys both mtud and body, should
apply immediately.
what a nity that a young man, the hope of his
country, the pride of his parents, should be
snatched from all prospect* and enjoyments o!
life by tho consequence# of deviating from the
path of nature, and indulging In a certain fucret
habit Such persons must, before contemplating
mj MARRIAGE
rciloct that a sound mind and body aro the most
necessary requisites to promote connubial happiness.
Indeed, without thuso the Journey through
life become* a weary pilgrimage; tho prospect
hourly darkens to the view, the mind becomes
shadowed with despair and filled with tho melancholy
reflection that the happiness of another
bocomea blighted with our own.

this painful disease it too often happens that an
ill-timed sense of shame or dread or discovery do
ten him from applying to those, who from education
and respectability, can alone befriend him,
delaying till the constitutional symptoms of thiH
horrid disease make thuir appearanco, such as
ulcerated soro throat, diseased noso, noctural
pains in the head and limbs, dimness of sight
deafness, nodes on tho shin-bones aud arms, progressing
with frightAil rapidity, till at last tho
Klato of tho mouth or the bones of tho nose bll
, and the victim of tills awftil disease becomes
a horrid object of commlsseration, till death puts
a period to tho dreadful sufferings, by sending
hlm4to " that Undiscovered Country from whence
no traveller returns." fi i V4 . . !
?rt Is a MELANCHOLY-FACT that thousands
mil victims to this terrible disease, owing to tho
nnskillAilness of ignorant pretuudcrs, who. by
tho use or that DEADLY POISON, MERCURY
ruin the constitution and make the residuo of
miserable.
