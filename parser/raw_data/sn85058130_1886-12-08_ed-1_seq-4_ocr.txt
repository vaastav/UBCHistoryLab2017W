hid it has been robbing the people so
trageously and fears that it will be

r ute from EJ Paso to the City of
Mexico and that hJ stopped oft at
Chihuahua here in company with an
American he strolled about the city
and upon returning to their hotel both
were arrested upon the cbarge of being
revolutonists being taken before a
magistrate tbe Rabbi showed papers
which proved his innocence and be I
I was released but his purse containing
Zis was confiscated for costs The
American refused to be robbed in any
Mich manner and was committed to
prison where bf now lies So many
instants of allej ii l outrages perpe
trated upon American citizens in
M xico have been investigated and
found to be wanting in merit or it has
ken learned that the Americans were
tho aggressors and deserved what they
got that people in this country now re
ceive with much doubt and suspicion
any tales of Mexican abuse of Ameri
cana The language of President
Cleveland shows plainly that
while the United States are not
desirous of quarreling with < l
and while this country is anxious to
avoid any unfriendly collision with the
Republic so closely allied to us in interests
I
terests the Greasers must respect
Americans and that the unreasonable
assumption of Mexican law and au
thority in the matter ot the arrest and
punishment of citizens of this Nation
who do not offend on the other side of
the border will not be admitted as a
valid excuse for wrongdoing on the
part of Mexico If investigation shall
show that the theory of Rabbi Kappa
hart is true as he tells it and that he
and his American companion were
guilty of no wrongdoing we may ex
pert that more will grow out of the
affair than has come from the Cutting
fiasco
Now COMES General Master Workman
Pjwderly head of the Knights of Labor
with the call for a special assessment
upon each member of the order The
assessment comes at a time when > the
Knights can least afford to respond
Many of them have been without work
for months past some voluntarily and
others involuntarily the winter is
uptnthem with its many necessities
and there is in time order widespread
discontent on account of tbe many
seneless strkes that have taken place
It is be ieved that if Mr Powderly shall
persist in the money being paid hun
dreds of the Knights will withdraw
from the order and free themselves
from association which I
an does there
no good and which requires fo much
of the money that ought to go for the
purchase of necessities and comforts
for women and children
THE STOCK DKAU
Burnt children may dread the fire
as the adage says but children of
arer growth like to continue the
torching California for the past
fifteen or twenty years have bsen burn
ing themselves in the fire of the stock
market but they dont dread the fire
to day half as much ss they did before
they had been burnt for now they are
fairly plunging into the fliinss and it
would seem to a disinterested on looker
that they were trying to have them
selves consumed
The recklessness the insanity the
almost criminality of dealing in IU n
ing stocks as they are dealt in in S n
Francisco wera never more forcibly
illustrated than during the present
boom A few weeks ago sOme of th
shires which are today selling for f30
10 and even higher were a drug
at a few cents It u not two
months since Consolidated Virginia was
considered a reckless buy at S 53 and
on Monday men were wild in heir I
desire to pay G5 for it It is nonsense
to say that the boom is founded on dis
coveries of new ore bodies in the mines
Only in one of the mines is it claimed
that any considerable find has been
made and as to the extent of that dis
covery nobody pretends to know it
may be large or it may be smallall
I the outside buyers of the shares can do
about it is to guess at the extent of the
alleged ore body after guessing as to
the existence of any such body With
this solitary except on there is no
reason why the stocks which ara being
dealt in at prices which make the mints
WOPth millions should be worth more
than theywerti six weeks ago or last
year Horn Silver or Crescent or Old
Telegraph hare just as much right to
advance in the market by reason of an I
ore discovery in Consolidated Virginia
as mefny of the stocks which are boom
ing in time ban rancuco Exchanges
Yesterdays transactions show that
the boom is fictitious that it is based
on no solid foundation the appearance
of the mine having little or nothing to
do with fixing the price of the stock
On Monday people were eager to buy
Consolidated Virginia at iC but on I
Tuesday the price dropped to 35 Sews
I from the mine did not bring about this I
change what the
mine contained was
no better known on Monday when the
shares were selling f or G3 than on Tues
day when they brought only 35 there
could have been no discovery or de
relenmcnt in twentvfoar hour that
I would have decreased the value of the
I property one bali Other sock
I
which are no more connected with Con
I solidated Virginia that the Emma is
t with tht Ontario went down with the
i leader and rallied with it I I
By tits lIme people should under
stand that there is c deal on and J
tlt somebody is in a fair way cf
g Uiir uwf Jy burnt ard they should
u wiuer aa that the manipulators
of tbe deal are not likely to do anything
to hurt themselves One of these fine
days there will come the reckoning as
it has come so many times in the past
and when It has arrived and the books
hare been squared the same old story
will be repeated two or thne nun
on the inside have cleaned up a mllicn
or two and two or three thousand men
and women have contributed their
all to make these big fortunes
None of the millions will T e
taken from the mines indeed U e
mines cut a very small figure in wh t
is going on in San Francisco The
reckless unwise daring men will give
up the money that the operators are
scheming to obtain and the mines or
their names will be used again and
again an means with which to gull
and plunder the unwary
TucHmuD Is glad that Utah people
are not madly given to mining stock
gambling The business Is bad through
I and through It doe a country to
good and brings suffering and misery
I to all who indulge in it save the very
few who work the act
Tae CHICAGO butchers are learning
by sad experience how foolish it is to go
out on a strike without taking into ac
count the consequences Of those who
went cut in a passion a few weeks ago
3003 are still unemployed at d i is be
lieved that they will have to leave the city
to get work During the ten days of the
strike the men lost in wages 250000 It
is true the packers are estimated to
have lost an even million but their
loss was no gain to the strikers The
railways and business men lost OOCOO
by the strike but this did not help the
strikers It is little comfort to a man if
be is starving to hear that others ate
hungry The total direct loss of the
ten days strike foots up to UiliOOO
none of which can ever be recovered
THE OlJ IO S
It is an interesting expression of
public opinion as to the Presidents
message which THE HERALD reporters
corralled on Tuesday and present
elsewhere in this issue Attention is
invited to what is said of Mr Cleveland
and his message and the reader is re
quested to note the various opinions
and comments It will be observed
that with remarkably few exceptions
the solid men of the community the
men who own property here and who
are interested in having peace
good order progress and t prosperity
applaud the Presidents utterances and
heartily approve his silence in regard to
the vexed problem On the other hand
the adverse criticisms are almost
exclusively by persons who have only a
temporary interest in Utahmen who
a jarcely claim a home in the Territory
and who are liable next month or next
year to gather their gripsacks and hue
to new fields We believe that if the
opinions of all the teen ui Utah as to
the wisdom and propriety of the Presi
dent in ignoring the local question in
hh message could be obtained it
would be found that nine out of every
ten of those who have a stake
in the country whose homes irp
here and who exject to make
this their abiding place would
heartily appiove Sir Clevelands
silence while the condemnation of hat
silence would come almost entirely I
from the floating adventurous class cf
men who have nothmg to lose in any I
event and who might gain something
by disturbance and pnblic diorder
Already a bitter feeling prevails
throughout the community fit f wouldnt
take much of this letalone policy tp
bring on a business boom in Ltah
TAE rGGETtoc that President Cleve j I
land will send to Congress a sr cia i mes
sage in reference to tile Mormon s is
very clever and does those fertil
brained gentlemen who advance it great
credit Tli President will doubtless
tender his thanks to these gentlemen
for considerately suggesting to ufm a
way out of the scrape into which his
silence has plunged him
I Sara 3EP3ES TATrvK McCreary of
Kentucky The Democrats of my
Di trict are happy because Democrats
are on guard In every Federal office in
my district I told the men I had ap
pointed tbatit was their duty to work
for the Democratic party in the ee
tioa and they did their duty Thats
Democracy It is good political sense
I
as well If it isnt a partisans duty to
work for his party in the elections it
isnt Lit duty to vote for his party I
ticket and if he will not vat fur tve
party he ought to be read out of the
organization as a man incapable of un I
derstanding or performing the obliga
tions and duties imposed upon him by
the society of which he is a member
