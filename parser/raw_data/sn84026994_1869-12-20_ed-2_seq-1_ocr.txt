WASHINGTON*, December ii-.
After an nll-nlgbt Hcmton ol ll, :he Senate
bas decided ibo ceorgi.! mailer, so raraalbut
body ii* concerned. After a discussion of two
boura atm a quai ter on the original bill reported
by the Judiciary Committee after thc amendment
requiring inc ratlilcatlon of Hie Fifteenth amend?
ment had been adopted) thc former was nut t?> si
vole at half-past 1 o'clock this morning, ami car?
ried by a largely Increased majority. Thc vole.
When called upon the llnal passage, stood, forty
live to nine against lt.
mtov,siox3 OK THE DIU?
Thc bill provides first, thal Immediately upon
the passage of the act thc Governor of ceorgia ia
required lo Issue his proclamation calling upon
all thc persons who were shown to have been
duly elected members or Hie Legislature by tho
proclamation of Uenernl Jlcade, dated June 26th,
1809, to assemble together at the Statehouse, in
Atlanta, on a day to bc named by the Governor.
When the members or thc original Legislature
have assembled as prescribed, Hie greatest care
is t ) be taken to see that no Ineligibles gel among
the faithful. To Insure this result two oaths aro
required io tie taken by Hie members before they
will be allowed lo take their seats In addition to
Hie one which they will Save to lake to support
thc constitutum or the State and of the Hu I ted
Slates, and Hie same, when subscribed, must bu
tiled In thc ellice or Hie Secretary or State. The first
of these oaths requires the members of thc Leg.
(stature to swear that they have never held nuy
Lulled State? otllcc, never been a member or
congress or a member of any Slate Legislature,
or held any office whatever for thc administra?
tion or justice under any Slate government,
which required them to take an oath to support
nie Constitution of thc United States, and after*
wards engaged In, or rendered any aid or com?
fort to, Hie rebellion-except lt was done In con?
sequence and by means of direct physical force
or accepted and held any oitlce under Hie govern?
ment of the so-called Confederate Slates. The
second oath requires the members to swear that
they have, been relieved ol their political disabili?
ties by an act or Congress. Those members who
rcruse io take ibo oath shall bc regarded ns ineli?
gible, and shall not-bc allowed lo toko thc seals
they claim. Those members Ineligible who may
take these oaths falsely dre declared to bc guilty
or arelony, and shall be Indicted and tried lor Hie
offence In thc District Court of the United States."
A NEW OnUAXIZATION.
Arter Hie Legislature has been thoroughly
purged of all ineligible members, the eligible mem?
bers shall commence tho work of reorganizing
tho two Houses by Hie election of olttccrs. All Hie
legislation of tl-.u last Legislature is declared to bc
only provisional. To guard against a second ex?
pulsion of thc negroes thc bill declares Hint Hie
Legislature shall not exclude any members of
that body on account of their race or color. In
order Hint the provisions or this may bc properly
unforced, thc President ls authorized to employ
the military forces or thc Untied States whenever
the Governor of the State sboiihl think it neces?
sary to apply for thom. Hy virtue of Morton's
r.racndinciii thc General Assembly ls required to
adopt Hie Fifteenth nmendment to the constitu?
tion before the Stale shall be decided to be In thc
Union or Its senators and representatives admit
*.c<l into Congress.
it is thc general Impression thal the effect of
'.his bill will bc to vacate all the State olllccs which
have been flllc-' by men elected or confirmed by
Hie Legislature, and that there will have to be a
new division of thc spoils. All the political nets
of thc prCHOii*. Legislature are declared to bc
swept away.
TUB Btu. TO nr.com: A LAW.
When thc House meets on Monday, Huller will
make a motion to lake up thc bill and put it upon
llnal passage without reference. This motion will
bo carried, and then Hie bill ls to be rushed
through Hie House at quarter-horse speed. Hut
very little Hmo will be allowed for debate, and no
Democratic members will bc allowed to obtain
thc door except those who have not studied t.p
thc facts of Hie case and are presumed to know
but little about thc matter.
A great deal of fooling ls manifested hero at the
Indecent haste with which this Important meas?
ure has been acted upon by Congress, and es?
pecially nt the allein [lied action in thc committee
room this morning. The passage or thc Lill In
thc House oa Monday, however, ls considered a
foregone conclusion. Thc Idea upon which thc
extremists are actiug Li to get thc bill through thc
House on Monday, and then carry it to the Presi?
dent and get Iiis signature to lt licrorc Congress
adjourns for the holidays, which lt wilt do on
Wednesday. Hy doing this they are enabled to
tend off thc effects which tho anticipated net iou
or thc Legislature would have had upon Congress
if the maller wa3 to be postponed until acer ibo

" A Tliglit Smart Cliimco for a How.*1
The Washington correspondent of tho New
Vortt World writes :
It is Just possible that all matters or mutual
concern between President Grant aud Congress
may not glide along so smoothly as has been ex?
pected. Thc Iden thal has got abroad, Hint thc
Congressional majority awaited the President's
message ns a dictum and arc to abide by lt as thc
law, ts a lillie abated. Western Congressmen
particularly-those o""joth panics-arc generally
loth to accept tho President's or Uoui well's rec?
ommendations on Hie subject or tintinee. They
say-those Western men-that thc proposition to
'continuo thc present heavy tnrlir mid taxation
is brutal or ridiculous, or both; that their con
? sa?nenla will consent io no such programme.
And there ls a good deal of this kind of talk
among tho Eastern men. Thc committee or

advocates or big taxation and the monopolists,
Jet alene the Democrats. Whiit Hie latter hnvc to

if they will, lu a Kilkenny cat light among them

dent's views by several of tho most liiHucntlnl
members of both house:* ts not loud, but deep,
and will yet manifest Itself. Such gentlemen soy:

ones who aro sent here lo uinkc the laws, or the

such as the continuation or alteration of thu

Tlie House I'ostf.l Committee has at last taken
up thc question of Hie abolition of the franking
privilege.
A calculation of thc public documents printed
ror thc Fortieth Congress, shows that each mem?
ber and senator had Hlfto pounds of agricultural
reports; 081 pounds of patent ofllccreports, and
HM pounds 01 Globes. Including smaller Items,
each member had over four toos in weight to
nend out to tho people, oinking an aggregate ror
both Houses of uoo members or about 1230 tons.
f If postngc paid was on all tho books at regular
h rates, it would cost $C53 ror each member. Esil
f mating at liberal rates other postal matter, in?
cluding speeches made In Congress aud business
.f tho people pertaining to legislation and to tho
various departments, lt is beliovcd that wcro
full postngo paid on every letter and document
sent that lt would reach $1000 per capita, or a
total of from $180,000 to $300,000 per annum for
senators aud representatives. What lt would
cost tho various departments to communicate
with their subordinates ls roughly estimated at
$1000 per day, making a total postage on tho
business now frauked about $700,000 per annum.

"TNDER TWO PI.AOS."
The first business disposed of In th-- ?Snttuj
yesterday was n Join t resolution of the House
providing tont the United Stntrs flag should be
hoisted over the Capitol building during tho delib?
erations of thc douerai Assembly. Itniney ?le?
sli cd to know what had become ol thc Hag used
nt the Inst session; if tho resolution provided for
thc purchase or another tin?, he was net certain
that tte wits in favor of concurring. Cot bin fa?
vored concurring, and thought that if the Slate
of South Carolina could not aflbrdniicw nag,
"then il had belter sell ont." Hoyt
moved to tiniond the resolution so thal
lhere should he a State flag hoisted over tho
capitol building also. Jlllson opposed the amend?
ment, staling that he owed allegiance lo only one
Ung. and that was Ihc stars mid stripes. CorWhi
reminded tito senators Hint they were represent?
ing South Carolina, mid should deliberate under
Hie folds of her ting us well ns under the Hug or
I he United States. Nash opposed the mjicnd- I
ment,! and said he owed allegiance to tho United j
States mid its flag only; in fact, lie woo not pic*
pareil tn acknowledge thal South Carolina had n
right to any flag nt all. Maxwell thouuhl that If
Nash owsd no allegiance to thc State lie had bet- |
1er vacate his seat. Thc amendment was anally
adopted, mid the resolution concurred In.
'.THE BOSE BILL,"
As the "bill lo grant to certain persona there?
in named thc exclusive right to dig ami minc
in thc beds or thc navigable streams and
waters or thc State for phosphate rock and phos?
phate deposits''is cnlled. was brought up lilllie
Senate yesterday. When thc bill was read the
ilrst time In thc Senate, it provided .'that the
Stale should graut to James H. Taylor, Alison W.
Thayer, Charles C. Coe, Ccorge W. Williams, Jo?
seph lt. Robertson, Edwin Platt, Jntnes Illidge,
Jr., William Illrnle, Edward Willis, Alex. lt.
Chlsolm, W. L. lindley, and such oilier persons as
Coy may associate with them, the exclusive
right to dig and mine," Ac. Thc bill was ordered
to bc printed, which was done, and brought into
the Senate chamber uiiottt ian Tuesday morning.
Since then sonic ono wrote another bill with Hie
head, enacting clause ami sections exactly like
thc bili as first presen lcd, with thc exceptlou of a
few additional names, and sent thc manuscript
to the primers, where it was printed, and
thc copies ftvh'lltulcd for these already In the
Senate chamber. This morning, when the bill
was called up, thc copies were laid on the desks
of the members, lt provided "that Hie State or
South Carolina docs hereby give and grnnt unto
the following named persons, to wit: I). T. Cor?
bin, U. H. Chamberlain, Jumes ll. Taylor, Reuben
Tomlltison, Anson W. Thayer, Timothy Hurley

nle, Edward Willis, Alex. R. Chlsolm, W. L
Urndley, and such other persons as they may as?
sociate with them, thc right to dig, mine," Ac,
Thc trick was soon observed, and considerable
amusement wits thereby occasioned, but legislat?
ing upon Hie Tulse hill was commenced.
A DENIAL.
Leslie. Mr. Speaker, when I want to dig phos.
pli?tes, I'll order my name to oe put on a bill for
that purpose, hut I wish ll to be understood that
my name was placed upon this bill without my
kuuwl'-dgc or conscut.
Corbiu. My name is nlso nu thc hi:;, I did not
authorize it,nor do] know how lt happened, but
ITl state thal I am interested lu the bill, for I
want to iee it passed, because it will bc of
benefit to Hie Stale.
WANT OP CUEBK.
Nash. Mr. Speaker, I haven't got Hie cheek to
vote for this bill, nor do I think the senators have;
if tiley did vote for it they could not look their
ronslitucuiH in thc face; perhaps Hie four years
tuen could vote for lt. Let mc look over these
names. Here is 1). T. Corbin amt D. IL Chamber?

know him; and Reuben Tonilinson; well; Anson
W. Thayer, 1 don't know him; and Tim Hurley,

didu't pul you down (C. W. Montgomery) Mr
Spcnkcr; Stanley C. Troll, the old post muster nt
Charleston; and c. P. Leslie, well, he's none back
upon the bill; Ccorge W. Williams; now wo aro

jil ! he ls the one who ls opposing tho labor move?
ment down in Charleston. (Cain, interrupting.
Don't you ntju.se llieso men, they ure my constit?
uents-laughter.] Weil, 'tis a wonder they didn't
[int a few more I). T. corblns, Ac, to whitewash
Hie bill to pull tho wool over our eyes. I can't
jellore there's a senator herc as hw got Hie check,
ltilcss -tis ihc "senator from Charleston" (Cor
jin)-for he's got thc worst or all. Some of thc
fellator.] w.ini lo postpone thu consideration of
tic bill for a day or two. Well, I am opposed to lt:
f we postpone lt thc parties Interested in it wit*
:ome around hugging and kissing a " feller," and
i tell you, 1 don't like lobe kissed by everybody,
I can't stand lt
Leslie uga. .. took occasion lo deny that lie knew
of his name being on tho bill, mid said that any
tine who asserted that he did told a deliberate ami
wilful falxchuod He did uot have nu Idea who
.lld il unless it tr as-(turning around mid look?
ing at the Speak r of tho Third House, Timothy
Hurley.)
Donaldson exj,. tined ih.it these men would
have to go to a great deal of expense before they
could even commence work, much less realize
anything, nml he was in favor of giving them a
liberal charter. He was, however, In favor of
postponing thc farther consideration of thesub
ct for tho present, In order that thu matter
might ho more thoroughly Investigated.
Corbin. Tho company ls willing to pay what?

honest banls. All these reports nnd denuncia?
tions ur the papers relative lo RB being a hugo mo?
nopoly, depriving tho poor man of his food and
swindling tho State, "arc simply-infamous."
They come from men who arc now stealing phos?
phates by tito thousands of tops, and for which
His State recurves not one cent. And now, when
n number of gentlemen organizo themselves Into
rt company to dig for these phosphates, and pay
Hie Stato for lt, a perfect howl ls raised. This
company bi wiitin? to pay whatever ls right tor
tho privilege.
Saith. I uta not willing to give my vote In

There is a nut nov.- watling to bc tunda a ln\
providing for thc prevention of bribery and coi
ruptlou. lt is doubtful whether its provision
will ever ne eu forced upon several members c
Hie Legislature. There is considerable tnlk ninon
several nf the members lu regard to Bowen, wh
promised them money to vote for thc gold til
mid forgot lu pay Hiern, lt is known that Howe
look a lunn into one or the committee moms Ht
day before thc bill passed thc House mid oirerc
him twenty-five dollars for every vote he secura
for thc bill, ile refused to accept timi or nnolht
bribe which was offered. It is freely usserte
that thirty-seven men were bribed, of which nun
ber two received one thousand dollar.-, each, n fe
two hundred dollars a piece, and Ihc rest brlbi
varying from thirty-seven lo len dollnrs. Son
two or three colored men express great Indigu
Hon against one,rann because he demanded ar.
received two Ihonsaud dollars, when, as they a
sort, lie has been known to giro only one dolli
for a vote. It ls probable.that I will be nble in
short lime to furnish o list of those bribed at
tho nmnunla received.
I Several of tho senators drew up a proie
j against the bill, and intended offering it in tl
' Semite to-day, but the Governor persuaded thet
(or one or them at least) not to do lt.
lt is reported herc Hitit there is now numil

The Ductor caine to his chamber door in lils
nightclothes, whero ho mci Ay ur, and extended
lils hand, saving "How are you, oPl fellow 1"
Ayer replied "I do not know that I can tako your
hand," uv something to thut effect, and Imme?
diately commenced firing. Oliver retreaicd into
lils chamber, where lila wifo was In bcd, pursued
bv Aver, who continued Dring until his victim
was Miali!. Four shots were th ed, one taking
ctrect tn tho breast, another severing an artery
above thc heart, and a third lodged in Hie
throat.

to seduce ber. Tho ruin of bis daughter carno to
Mr. Ayer's knowledge only a few days ago, and
ho Immediately determined upon vengeance,

al thc Central Hotel until this morning, when he
went to Dr. Oliver's residence and Inquired for
him. Waa Invited Into the house awl met Oliver
nt his chamber door, 'who extended lils baud.
Ayer snld "l cannot tako your hand; I must have
your blood for tho Injuries you havo done mc,"
drawing at tuc saino Hmo a revolver and com?
mencing to fire. Oliver retreated Into tho allam?
