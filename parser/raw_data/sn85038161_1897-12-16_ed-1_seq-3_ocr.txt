WAHH1NUT0N LETTER.
From Our feegnUr Correspondent.
Washington; D. 0., December 10, 1897.
The most astounding thing brought to
i light by the first week of the session of
Congress is the audacity of the agents
of the lobby which is trying to prevent
the annexation of Hawaii. It is only
neccessary for a Senator or Representa
tive of prominence to express in private
conversation the slightest doubt of the
wisdom of annexation to have these
agents announce through such news
papers as they control or can by hook
or crook obtain space in cash Is un
questionably paid in some instances
that the Senator or Representative in
question is straining every nerve to de
feat annexation. They have thus mis
represented Senators Morrill and Hoar
and Speaker Reed. It seems as sure as
anything can be that such audacity is in
the end bound to react upon those who
employ it, and to result in making more
votes for annexation than against it.
This lobby was started by the sugar
trust, but there are reasons for believ
ing that a portion of the money it is
spending so liberally comes from the
secret fundB of ,ttiree foreign nations
. which desire to prevent annexation, but
have no reasonable excuse for attempt
ing to do bo openly. Some of the Dem
ocratic Senators who talked the loudest
against trusts, during the campaign,
aro acting in concert with the sugar
ttust now. In fact, with two exceptions,
( Gorman and Morgan, all the Democratic
Senators appear to have landed, bag and
baggage, in the lobbyists' camp. Senator
Davis, of Minn., chairman of the com
mittee on Foreign Relations, which
has charge of the treaty, is thoroughly
confident that annexation will be ac
complished through the treaty, and ab
solutely certain that a bill providing for
annexation can be passed by both Sen
ate and House, shuld the power of the
lobby be sufficient to prevent the ratifi
cation of the treaty. 'It is his intention
to push the matter to a conclusion in
the Senate at the earliest possible mo
ment. Senator Chandler, chairman of the
committee of Elections and Privileges,
says that committee will decide upon its
report in the Oregon case at its next
meeting and that he has no doubt the
report will be in favor of seating Hon.
H. W. Corbett, as successor to Hon. H.
H. Mitchell, whose term in the Senate
expired last March. If the Democrats
who have expressed themselves in favor
of seating Mr. Corbett vote that way he
will be seated.
The House committee and Appropria
tions broke the record when it reported
the Pension Appropriation bill to the
House this week, thus furnishing evi
dence that Chairman Cannon and the
industrious members of his committee
intend to do their part towards pushing
the imperative business of this session,
in order to help along the project for
early adjournment, which is generally
favored by Republicans. The Pension
bill carries $141,218,830,of which $140,
000,000 is for the payment of pensions.
It has already been made apparent
that a serious attempt is going to be
made at this session of Congress to mod
ify the civil service rules. President
McKinley having stated in his annual
message that he believed many posi
tions were now embraced by the civil
service rules which ought not to be, Re
publicans in Congress do not feel that
they are antagonizing him or the party
platform in taking part in this move
ment, although so good a Republican as
Representative Johnson, of Indiana, has
told them in a speech made in reply to
Gen. Grosvenor, of Ohio, that he disa
greed with them. Gen. Grosvenor's
idea, which he will endeavor to get
through in the shape of a bill, is that
the only employes of the government
who should be embraced by the civil
service rules are the clerks, whose duties
are not executive, in the departments at
Washington and employes of the postal
service in all branches. All other posi
tions he desires to have thrown open
and the Democrats who now fill nine
tenths of them thrown out to make room
for the Republicans.
President McKinley !s being detained,
at Canton by bis sad duty has not in any
manner inconvenienced Congress, as he
arranged all matters requiring his per
sonal attention before starting upon his
last trip to the bedside of his dying
mother. Everywhere bis name is men
tioned the deepest sympathy is expressed
for him.
The Committee on Banking and Cur
rency has obtained permission from the
House to sit daily during sessions ot the
House, and will at once endeavor to
agree upon one or more bills embodying
portions of the financial recommenda
tions made by the President in his an
nual message and by Secretary Gage, in
his annual roport to Congress. Secretary
Gage has been asked to put his idea in
to a bill and submit it to the committee.

The Underground Railroad.
Editor Campbell, of the Sardinian,
will shotly issue a pamphlet on the work
ing of the Underground Railroad. It
will contain reminiscences from the pens
of Dr. I. M. Beck, S. W. Hoggins, P. R.
Klncald and Oapt. Oal. Ranking. Broth
er Campbell would add much of inter
est to his work by visiting some of the
older citizens of the important stations
on the underground line.
The above we copy from the News
Herald, published at Hillsboro, which
reminds us of two incidents that occurr
ed in West Union, which came under
our immediate notice. The first one oc
curred in the summer of 1830, when a
neatly dressed gentleman came into the
shoe shop, then being carried on by
Nicholas Burwell, father of the senior
editor of this paper, and applied for
work, representing himself as a first
class workman. My father gave him a
trial job, and as he was so well pleased
with the work gave him a permanent
situation.
The gentleman gave his name as Rob
ert Collins, and his former residence ,as
Lexington, Ky. He was a very intelli
gent gentleman, of good habits, and was
taken into my father's family for board.
He soon became well acquainted and
mingled with the best and most stylish
young ladies in our town. About four
weeks after Collins arrived, while work
ing at the front window of the shop he
discovered four gentleman riding down
Maine street, and as quick as thought
he jumped from the bench, threw off
his apron and run down through the
back lot and into the wooded hills north
of town.
In less than an hour after Collins had
left the shop, two strangers came in and
inquired if there was a journeyman
working in that shop ? "Yes, sir," said
my father, "I have a man by the name
of Collins in my employ." "That's him,"
said the stranger, and then related, "I
am his master, and have owned him
from infancy, and while in his teens I
bound him out to learn the boot and
shoe business, and just at the time he
would be of service to me he ran away.
I have offered $1,500 reward for him."
Three months after Collins left, my
father received a letter from him dated
Montreal, Canada. About all it con
tained was the emphatic words, "I have
broken the shackels safe, safe, safe !"
Another case Along in the '50's
James Lyon's, colored, who resided in a
log building at the extreme northwest
corner of West Union, came to my house
in the fall of that year, about 0 o'clock
at night, and invited me to his house,
stating that there was a fugitive slave at
his home and that he wanted some in
formation in regard to the nearest and
most practical course for him to take, in
striking for his liberty. We, of course,
went to see him and gave our best coun
sel, together with some material aid.
We also suggested that N. W. Darling
ton, who is still an honored citizen of
our town, be sent for. We afterward
learned that Mr. D. piloted the fugitive
across the hills to Mr. Mclntire's, on
Cherry Fork, which was a prominent
station on the Underground Railroad.

KICKING IN SINNEMAHONE.:
1 S
nOTHMO LIKE THAT FEVER EITHER
BEFORE OR SIMCE.
(MtonanaonaaftaA))
"pVONDER if any of you on this side
JL the mountain remember the
strange ailment that visited us folks on
the other side when. I was n young
man?" said the man from over Sinne
mahonlng vvny. "A strange nihnent it
una indeed. Sort of an uncontrollable
derangement of the muscular tissues
of the leg, the doctors called it, but It
was known as the kicking fever of the
Sinnemahone, I wonder if any of you
remember It?"
"Natur'ly, It ain't likely thnt any
body does." said1 the man In the red,
blue, green, pink, yellow and purple
Mackinaw jacket, "but any fever tlint
ever got mixed up with folks on the
Slnnemnhone an' didn't kick must a
been of setch a mild an' forgivin' a dis
position ns to make it a sham to feed
quinine to it."
"Thanks, Mackinaw," said the man
from over Sinnemahoning way. "Your
gentle humor goes far toward dissipat
ing a certain sadness and tend'ency to
abstraction and a fit of the blues that
always assail me when I think of that
kicking fever of the Sinnemahone. and
t thank you! When I see the fertile
acres of the Jepheniah Biffkins estate
spreading along the Sinncmahoning's
classic bottom and think how they
would now all be mine but for that
kicking fever I am prone to sadness.
But you've knocked 'em silly this time.
Mackinaw.
"Yes. yes. Those rich Jepheniah
Biffkins acres wouldl now be mine but
for that kicking fever that came to the
Sinnemahone country. These acres
then belonged to Deacon Judcl Peeler,
and the deacon's daughter Nancy had
promised to be my wife, and Xancy was
heir to all the wide Peeler estate. So
when I think but let that pass. It is
all over now.
"Wherever that most singular ail
ment could have come from no one ever
knew, but It certainly cut a wide swath
along the Sinnemahone. I was off down
the river when it began its attack, and
consequently I didtn't know anything
about it until I got back home a couple
of weeks later: The first person it struck
was Uncle Billy Tope. Uncle Billy was
a mild and easy-going citizen that no
one would have thought had any life
in him at all, and lie was a strict tee
totaler. Consequently you may imagine
the astonishment pf Squire Hunker,
who owned the sawmill where Uncle
Bill- worked, to see the old man com
ing up the road one day. giving a tre
mendous kick every two or three steps
he took.sometices to the right and some
times to the left, as if he might have
started out to kick all creation into the
middle of next week. Squire Bunker
was scared, and ho edpod off to one side
of the Toad as Uncle Bil!y came along,
kicking and scuffing and looking as
wild as an Indian. The sqi'ire ventured1
to say as the old man'WTsc.ivortingby:
"'What's up. Willii-ni?'
"Uncle Billy only shook his head, and
giving a kick that didn't miss the
squire's jaw by more than half an inch,
went on his way toward home, kicking
as he went.
" 'Astounding!' exclaimed the squire.
'I never thought I'd live long enough
to see Uncle Billy Tope turn out to be a
drinker!'
"Then the squire started1 for home.
He hadn't gone a hundred .yards before
he began to feel a little mulish himself,
and the first thing he knew he was
kicking away as unreasonably as Uncle
Billy, ne couldn't stop it any more
than he could have stopped his mill race
with a three-inch plug. The squire
didn't have for to go, and before he
could reach out and open his door he
had kicked1 it open with a bang, and his
wife came running out of the kitchen to
see what was the matter.
" 'Clear the way, mother!' the squire
hollered. 'Give meooni! Don't get in
my way or I'll make a widower of my
self at one swoop!'
"The squire's wife, scared almost to
death, locked herself up in a closet, and
the squire kicked his way out of the
backdoor and brought up in thegarinn.
where he yelled for some one to come
and tie him down, or else turn him into
a ten-acre lot where he could have room.
"And that's the way that most unac
countable kicking fevr started along
the Sinnemahone. In le;S than a week
It had' taken a whack at almost every
man, woman and child in that baili
wick. The kicking was only the pre
monitory symptom of the fever. After
the victim had kicked high and kicked
low. and to the windward and to the
leeward, for half an hour or so, the fit
would pass away, but it would come
back again after awhile. The kicking
stage of the epidemic lasted two days,
and then the second stage came on.
This was a scorching fever. Sam Betts,
when he got over his attack, declared
that his fever was so hot that his wife
had to keep the-sheets wet to prevent
their catching fire, but Sam wasn't a
native of the Sinnemahoning country.
He was from this side of the mountain
somewhere, and folks didn't believe
him. The fever lasted a day, and left
behind it a consuming longing for
something to dr'.nk not 'water nor
coffee nor tea nor milk, but rum, rye,
apple juice, anything that had tooth
and edge to it. This strange symptom
of the malady was discovered in a start
ling way. Dominie Dibble was the first
victim that it developed in. One even
ing while half a dozen of his flock were
mingling their sorrow with the domin
ie's over his affliction he suddenly
shouted:
"4Give me rum! Fetch me some
scorching rye or biting gin!'
"The brethren and" sisters were
shocked, but Dominie Dibble kept on
hollering for rum. No one made a move
togai him aay, and at last besprang out
of als caarr, rushed out of the bouse,
and made straight for the tavern like u
man running to a fire. By and by he
came back singing:
" 'Homo again, homo again,
From a foreign shore.'
"lie had a bottle of mm under his
arm, nnd the brethren and1 sisters hur
ried home, feeling that the end of all
things couldn't be far away. When It
got out, though, that the dominie was
simply suilering from the third stage of
the kicking fever, they excused him nnd
rejoiced. But the dominie always de
clared that he never had'such a pleasing
antidote for pain. Then it began to be
noticed thnt this Inst peculiar stage of
the ailment seemed to have no regular
period of existence, nnd it is noted n a
fact that the afflicted district wasn't
entirely nble to be out and around as
usual until the tavern keper gave
notice thnt there wasn't a drop of any
thing left thnt the last stage of the
kicking fever called for.
"During the time the fever lasted
three leading citizens of the Sinnema
hone were carried off In their bloom by
it, not one of whom even had the con
solation of enjoying the treatment for
the last stage. First, there was Ahiram
Hinkle. When the kicking fever first
struck the district, the doctor said that
the harder the victims had to kick the
better it would be for them, for if they
couldn't kick hard it would strike in
nnd that would be the end of 'era. The
kicking always came in the right leg.
IVovv Abiram Hinkle uiun t have any
right leg, it having been taken off clean
In the saw Trill. When the attack seized
him he cou t:.'t kick. It struck in and
away he went.
"N'ext was Simon Shelly. Simon
swore by Elijah rink, the horse doctor,
who could cure anything, according to
Simon's belief. Elijah hadlcured a kick
ing horse for Simon onetime by rigging
him to some sort of a contrivance
that threw him every time the horse
kicked. Simon made up his mind that
he was just as npt to have the kicking
fever as his neighbors were, so he sent
forEIijah to rovide against it. He hnd
Elijah fit him with a rigging some
thing like the one that cured1 the kick
ing horse. The very next day the ail
ment seized him. Simon was standing
by n window in his house. He gave one
tremendous kick. The rigging worked.
Il threw Simon. It threw him out of the
window and head first into a barrel of
rain w ater that stood beneath it. They
didn't discover Simon in time, nnd that
made two fellow citizen, the epidemic
carried away.
"Its third victim was Eratus Sleeper.
Erastus went out to milk his cow one
evening, and just as he began the kick
ing fever took hold of him. He shot out
a iick. Tt hit the cow in the shin. The
diense was o very contnglousthat iust
that one kick gave it to the cow. The
cow kicked. Her kick landed in Erastus'
stomach, and knocked the wind out of
him so far they couldn't get it back.
Erastus' widow married Jeff Ttoner. the
sheep-pelt buyer.
"Well, this brings me round to my
own deep disappointment. Jepheniah
Biffkins had been pnying more atten
tion to Deacon Peeler's daughter Xan
cy thnn seemed to me safe, and when I
came back -home that time I made up
ray mind I'd settle the matter right
then and there and know whether Xan
cy was destined to be a Biffkins or a
Pettibone. I went straight to the dea
con's that very evening, before. I had
been home half an -hour. This was just
at the. time the kicking fever was get
ting in its best licks, but I didn't know
a thing about it. Xancy was home, and
I hadn't been there long before she had
promised that hor name should be
Pettibone. T was happy, I tell you, and
just before I got ready to go Deacon
Peeler himself came in. We had a very
cheering talk for a minute or tvv o, and
started to go. Just as I opened the door
I felt a tremendous Shock, and at the
same time I rose in the air more, than
three feet. When I landed I was stand
ing out in the yard. Before I had come
entirely to I felt the shock again. Again
I was lifted and swept several feet
further out in the yard. Then I looked
back. Nancy's father was just behind
me with a queer look on his face. His
right foot rose up and shot out, and the
shock came a third time. Deacon Peeler
was as strong as an ox, and his foot
was shod with a Xo. 12 cowhide boot.
This time the shock lifted me over the
gate and set me down in the road. Xan
cy had come running from the house,
and she cried out:
'"Father ain't kicking j-ou, Praxy!
It's only the fever that's workin' on
him! He ain't kicking you!'
"Well! If he wasn't kicking me I
didn't know what they called kicking
along the Sinnemahone, and I think I
made a remark to that effect as I hur
ried home in sorrow nnd w ent to bed.
Xext day I heard about the kiekirg
fever for the first, and then I knew
what Xancy had meant when she de
clared that her father wasn't kicking
me. I went right back with a heart
lighter than a feather, but Xancy made
it heavy as lead in less than half a min
ute. "'Praxiteles Pettibone!" she said,
'you went and ran away from father
last night when he was sick and suffer
ing! You're too heartless for me!'
"That ended it nil between Xancy
Peeler and me. The kicking fever had
dpne it although, as I remember it
now, I saw Deacon Peeler out in bis
garden hoeing potatoes that morning,
as quiet and steady as ever 'he was.
But Xancy married Jepheniah, and the
broad acres of old Deacon Peeler to this
day spread themselves out over yonder
along the Sinnemahone ns the Biffkins
estate, actually calm and peaceful and
smiling, as if they hadn't missed the
opportunity of being this day on the
tax list in the name of Praxiteles Petti
bone." X. Y. Sun.

Drawback of which was, it " Made Her Too Fat."
From the Evening
The doctor came in hate and found his
patient again in great agony from a splitting
headache. It was his fifth call on the same
patient, and each time to treat the same
trouble. With a suspicion that his diagno
sis was incorrect and that he was treating a
symptom and not the disease, he said to her:
"Madam, it is useless for me to visit you
again. You are keeping from me facts and
symptoms which it is necessary I should
know. The patient finally acknowledged
that, through a false modesty, she had not
told him ail. Then she told how she had
suffered from female weakness but had kept
It from him too modttt to speak. The old
doctor was disgusted at such prudishness,
but when he knew the facts, cured her easily
and quickly.
The following case differs from the above,
only in the fact that tho patient is not afraid
to speak, and to "call a spade aspade."
"Words fail to describe the suffering I
endured before I used Dr. Williams' l'ink
Pills for Pale People," said Mrs. Alexander
B. Clark, of 417 Michigan Avenue, Detroit,
Mich. "For five years I have suffered
from ovarian troubles, and was confined to
my room for months at a time. I have
nndergone two operations for this trouble at
the hospital, and seemed to grow worse
instead of better. Iliad the best doctors and
the best nursing, but for nearly five jearsl
was not free for one single day from the
most fearful headaches nnd intense twitch
ing pains in my neck and shoulders.
' You would scarcely believe, to look at
me now, that for about three days every
week for nearly six years, I had to stay in
bed. Those headaches would come on me
every week regularly. First I would notice
black spot before my eyes, and then I
would go blind, and send for the doctor.
" At first they would treat me for indiges
tion rand dyspepsia, then finally acknowl
edge that something else caused the trouble.
NOT ALWAYS UNDERSTOOD,
A fact often overlooked, or not always
understood, is that women suffer as
much from distressing kidney and blad
der trouble as the men. The womb ib
situated back of and very close to the
bladder, and for that reason any distress,
disease or inconvenience manifested in
the kidneys, back, bladder or urinary
passage is often, by imistake, attributed
to female weakness or womb trouble of
some sort.
The error is easily made and may be
as easily avoided by setting urine aside
for twenty four hours ; a sediment or
settling :'s evidence that your kidneys
and bladder need doctoring If you
have pain or dull aching in the back,
pass water too frequently, or scanty sup
ply, with smarting or burninvr, these
are also convincing proofs of kidney
trouble. If you havo doctored without

A'eut, Detroit, Mtch,
During these spells I was so nervous that I
could not bear to have my husband walk
across the floor, and as the doctors said there
was no medicine that would reach my
trouble, I consented to the operations, which
left me worse off than I was before.
"In January of this year there was an
article iu the Eicning Neut about the drag
cists tt ut sold Dr. Williams' Pink Pills in
Ditioit. I told my husband I was going to
try them and he said, 'try anything?
" The next morning I went into Murphy
Brothers' drug store and bought a box of
Dr. Williams7 Pink Pills. Mr. Murphy
said he had a big sale for the pills and per
sonally knew many people who had been
helped by them. I took the pills as directed,
hut was not helped a bit, and I told Mr.
Murphy to, but he suggested that I give
them a better trial. Before I had finished
the second box I began to feel better and
went down and bought a dozen boxes.
When I had taken Bis boxes my headaches
were gone, hut I continued using the pills
until I hud taken the twelve boxes.
"Just think what I have suffered by
operations and vile medicines, when a sim

Ohio History In Fiction
Why has Ohio not developed a large
number of promising authors during
the last decade, is a question that haa
often been asked by those interested in
the geographical distributiou of the men
and women who make books. Howells,
the Piatts, and many others won fame
for Ohio in the past, but they are grad
ually giving way to a younger school,
few of whom come from Ohio, or write
of Ohio scenes or people.
Yet no state presents a richer field for
the story writer than Ohio, or holds more
varied and picturesque elemeuts of pop
ulation. Characters as interesting and
pathetic as any in fiction form part of
of our every day life
It is interesting to note in this connec
tion that the Ohi State Journal, which
is rapidly developing into the greatest
distinctively Ohio paper in the State,
has just discovered a new Ohio novelist,
from whose work much is expected.
Early in December the State Journal
will begin the publication in its Sunday
and Semi weekly editions, of a new his
torical novel, "In The Days of St. Clair,"
by Dr. J. B. Naylor of Malta, Ohio, in
which the struggles and dangers of the
early settlers at Marietta and in the
Muskingum Valley are vividly depicted.
Governor Arthur St. Clair, Rufus Put
man, and other historical characters fig
ure in it, and a charming loye story is
interwoven with a thrilling plot in which
white outlaws and savage outlaws and
savage Indians are leading characters.
The scene opens in the Shenandoah
Valley, thus affording an opportunity
for tracing the emigration of one great
source of Ohio's early population. The
actors are speedily transferred to Ohio,
however where the stern hardships of
pioneer life are clearly and attractively
drawn.
Dr.JNaylor has more than a local rep
utation as a poet, having published two
volumes of very creditable verse, under
the nom de-plume of S Q Lapius. His
short stories have also attracted atten
tion. "In the Days of St Clair" is his first
novel, and those who have been per
mitted to read it in advance of publica
tion are confident that it will win sue
cefs.
it win unuouoteaiy prove a great iea
ture of the Sunday and Semi Weekly;;
issues of the State Journal, which already,
have no superiois in Ohio. The pub
lishers of the State Journal are to be
commended for their enterprise in bring
ing out such a promising new novelist.
It is such support that gives encourage
ment to the bright minds of Ohio in
their efforts to enter the field of author.
