Presuming that the birds aro In pood
health, well matured and ready to begin
Jnying In November or Dccemlor and that i
they aro houpcd In dry, sanitary quarters,
tlicro aro rertaln points of vital Impor
tance that must receive careful atten
tion. In tills nrtlclo Mr. Illcks discusses
In detail the prime essentials to good egu
production during cold weather.
"When It Is decided to start the flock
laying, a richer feed should be need than
Is advisable after they are well started.
More beef scrap can be used and gluten
Weal In larger quantities than In later
months. A small amount of green cut
bono is useful, provided It can he oh
tnlned at a reasonable price. It should
not bo over four cents a pound ready cut.
It will not pay to feed It largely at even
threo cents, but can be used as a stimu
lator. Some use mustards and peppers,
tut as a rule these aro not ndvlsablo be
cause they tend to overstlmulate and aro
Vellevcd by many to Injure thn useful
ness of the fowl In later months.
After tho hens are laying well the ra
tion and Its proportions aro not of so
much Importance. They must be given
careful attention, however, for tho first
few weeks that the hens aro beginning
tho heavy egg yield. As the feeds that
are rich in protein, like beef scrap and
Kreen bone, aro usually the costly ones,
these should bo reduced gradually and
the cheaper feeds containing less protein
substituted. Another reason for this Is
that as the weather gets colder the laying
hens or pullets will necil more carbona
ceous feeds, such as corn and corn meal.
COMPEL. EXEItClSE.
The grain feed and mash feed should
ho given In about equal parts. The mash
phould be fed largely In the litter so as
to compel exercise. The grain feed at the
Ftart should ho one-half wheat, one
fourth oats, and one-fourth cracked corn.
Tho corn should bo cracked medium fine
and sifted so as to savo the lino grains
and corn meal.
After tho flock is laying an nverage
production of around CO per cent, the
n mount of wheat should be reduced and
tho proportltlon made one-third each of
wheat, cracked corn and oath. To this
Jnay be added one-half a part of barley if
It can be bought cheaper per pound than
wheat or oats. It is hardly as good feed
for egg production as wheat and Is not
quite as good as oats, but It furnishes a
variety. One-half a part of buckwheat
may also be added if it can bo bought at
n little more than corn as it compares In
food valuo with corn and should be ured
for its heat creating properties.
These changes mut be mado gradually,
decreasing tho wheat a little at a time
end increasing the substitutes In the
rnmo proportion. It Is not advisable to
feed even tho coarsest beef scrap In the
Kraln feed, as too largo a portion of It is
liable to bo lost in tho litter and it nb
porbjs dirt and filth worse than the grains.
This grain feed is sometimes termed tho
"scratch feed" because it Is fed in tho
Utter to make the hens scratch.
When tho hens are laying full and the
leather Is cold, a feed of entire cracked
corn should be given Just before night.
Clvo them all they will cat and If a little
Is left for tho first morning feed, yn much
the better.
CHANGE FEED GRADUALLY.
The mash at first should be rich In pro
tein and this gradually decreased and

"Tho most Important and tho most

Single Comb Brown Leghorns
I.lko others In the Leghorn trlho tho
Single Comb Urown Leghorn Is a hcav
egg producer and a non-sitter. Breeder
must depend upon hens of other breeds
or use artificial means to hatch unit
brood tho chicks. IJccanse of tho rich
led and grcon-blark colors of the male
and the soft brown plumago of the fe
male, this breed Is much adinlicd. It
Is popular with tho fancier as well as
with the farmer.
Several of our popular American breed
ers owe their quality of heavy egg pro
duction to the Urown Leghorn, which has
out for tho grain feed. The first tun
may be as follows: 1W pounds corn me '
Km pounds good flour middlings. 1M pouni:
winter wheat bran, KO pounds beef sera;
! pounds alfalfa or clover meal, Pi
pounds gluten meal, 10) pounds ground
oats. A little line charcoal anil a pound
of salt should be added to each .""o pounds.
Wet mnsh should bo fed onco a day,
preferably about in to 11 o'clock. Good
results can he obtained by feeding in open
hoppers w here It is In roach of the birds
nil tho time. In real cold weather, It will
pay to heat the wet mash by mixing with
hot water.
With Leghorns the feed may bo kept
1 eforo tho llock all the time, but with
some Hocks of the heavier breeds It will
lio found they will eat ton largo a pro
portion of mnsh. It Is udvi.-able, there
fore, to leave the hoppers open only half
tho day. Mash Is very rich and may
cause some tumble with looseness of bow
els. If it does, cut down the gluten one
half for a few days. If this does not stop
tho trouble, cut the beef scrap one-half
This can be fed safely for four or live
weeks until tho hens are laying well. Aft
er tlds, increase the corn meal to t'i'l
pounds and cut the beef scrap and gluten
meal one-half each, making tho change
gradually.
Pome form of green feed Is very essen
tial for these two months. The best gieen
feed obtainable Is sprouted oats, but
where they cannot bo grown, mangel beet
and even common beets or cabbage may
be ui-cd. Hoots aro not worth over SO
tents a hundred for feeding while cab
bage Is hardly worth that.
Oats may bo sprouted in a cellar or
even In a room of the resldenco or other
place where a temperaturo of Co to C
degrees may bo kept nil the time. It
colder than this tho sprouting Is slow,
and If allowed to freeo the spinuts are
killed. Only the best of oats, unbleach
ed, should be used They should be wet
down In water for 12 hours, using a tub
or vat. Then they should be spread out
on trays about 20 Inches square and three
Inches deep, making the oats two Inches
deep for two or threo days until they nr"
veil sprouted. They should bo stirred
every day for the first few days and wet
r thoroughly with cold water. Warm water
' causes mold, as will a failure to stir the
j oats well daily. After tho sprouts aro well
! grown, about two inches long, the oats
should be divided again, making them
alout one inch and a half thick. The,
should be wet dally after this, hut not
stirred. It takes about seven to 10 days
to grow them well, according to tempera
ture, the grade of oats and the care given
them.
KEEP LITTER DRY ANT) CLEAN.
Tho litter for the house Is an Important
feature that Is not often given proper
chtnery, the development of cheap
and rapid means of transportation,
and tlie opening of the world's mar
kets to our farm products, have all
combined to mako posslblo and to
oncourago rapid deterioration of
American soils. Crop rotation is good
farm practice, hut It makes posslblo
mure rapid soil depletion because of
tho larger crops produced where In
sect pests nnd plant disease aro avoid
ed by such rotation.
"The United States bureau of census
icports that the aggregate area of Im
proved farm land agriculturally abandon

New England, New York. New Jersey

chusetts should entirely stop farming, tho
fact would be mado known and em

Improved farm land Is to bo agriculturally
abandoned, It could be so selected as to
stop farmln-r In eight States, including
New Hampshire, Vermont, Massachusetts,
Rhode Island, Connecticut, Now Jersey,

In other words, tho combined area of
Improved farm land found In these eight

When the weather becomes bad and

Imperative to mako them exercise a good
I part of each day, Tho exercise seems to
I help develop tho egg organs and at tho
same tlmo enable the hens to eat heavily
and to digest the feed well. Tho very
active hen Is always the eaily layer and
also tho heaviest layer at this critical
. petlod of the ye ir.
The best way to compel an abundance
1 of exercise Is to feci In a deep litter, as
described above. This litter should be
from eight to 15 Indies deep. Tho larger
breeds require deeper litter. Tho feed
.-hoiild be scattered In the litter at each
feeding, except at night, by either kicking
lit In or using an automatic feeder that
I will drop a little at a time in the litter
and thus keep the hens digging and hunt

Only such amounts should be fed as will
I be entirely consumed by the next feed
' lug. Tlie litter should be examined often
to sen if any feed Is left underneath. This
, will show whether the amount of feed
given should ho cut down, and to what
extent.
FIRST FEED SHOULD BE HEAVY.
Tho ilrst feeil should be given as eaily
In the morning as It Is light enough for
tho fowls to sec to eat and begin scratcn
Ing. This should be a heavier feed than
at other feeding times throughout tho
day. The next of the scratch feed should
be given at nine, one and thteo o'clock
I with a tlnal feed of grain later In the
afternoon. Green feed should bo given
between 11 and 12 o'clock,
1 The flock should bo allowed open rango
' outdoors as much as i..siblo except on
, stormy days when the snow Is so deep
that they cannot exercise. Tho windows
should bo open as much as possible and
only clo.-ed on stormy nights when there
is danger of the snow or rain blowing In
and wetting the house. If a cold wind is
blowing light Into the. windows, it is
control of tho farmer, If he Is provided
with accurate information and with tho
neeepsary capital to enable lilm to put
Into practice rational systems of truly per
manent ngilculture. There was no need
whatever that tho cultivated farm lands
of the eastern States should havo been de
pleted. Lying nt the door of our greatest
markets, with tho application of knowl
edge nnd with such encouragement as
should have been given, those lands could
easily have been preserved and even In

Congress Begins a New Era
in the Personal Fortunes of
the Nation's Chief Executive.
"Washington, Dec. 8. Congress has ad
vanced another preliminary step by re
ceiving In Joint session Picsldent Wilson's
annual mcsrage. All In all. tho delivery
of tills communication was an exceptional
event; tho Interest In Its contents was
preoccupying. Never before has President
Wilson stood beforo the legislative
branches so firmly established In their
confidence. He has proscntcd two or three
extraordinary messages during his ad
ministration, but probably none quite so
much out of tho ordinary or so moment
ous to his administration and the coun
try. Notwithstanding this, no message from
President Wilson was ever received so
coldly by senators and representatives.
This did not seem to be on account of
antagonism or hostility. Some ascribed
It to the fact that the President did not
speak with personal enthusiasm. He ap
peared weary and exhausted. But It has
been noticed that the legislators nro not
ns enthusiastic as usual. Men havo been
sobered by the procession of stressful
happenings. There Is a serious realiza
tion of the protentous times.
When tho President lashed plotters in

With tho opening of Congress begins a
now phase In tho administration of Wood
row Wilson, a new era in his personal
fortunes. In mid-summer and early fall
it seemed to many as If ho were, indeed,
at the crest of tho wave. The Lusltanla
notes had thrilled the country which stood
unitedly behind him In tho national cmcr
goncy. His Mexican policy was beginning
to bear fruit, and both as to Mexico ani
Europe tho Amorican people as a whole
were profoundly grateful that he had
kept tho country out of war. To tho lone
ly President In his seclusion at Cornlsn
and during thoso trying midsummer days
and nights In Washington when he stag
gered under the heaviest burdens carried
by any President since Lincoln, tho sym
pathy of tho nation went In amazlns
measure. Republican and democratic poli
ticians united In saying that If the presi
dential election were to bo held In Novem
ber It would be the statesman In tho
White House first and tho rest nowhere,
for they all knew men of political faith
oppo?ed to that of tho President who were
then enthusiastically praising his hand
ling of our international relations.
Now, early in December, the situation
has changed, as political situations so
often do chango with astonishing rapidity
In this mercurial country of ours. The
crest of the Wilson wave has receded.
His stock Is off, perhaps not many points,
but still It off sufficients to have at
tracted a good deal of attention had It
been listed on the stock exchange. One
docs not havo to lay one's ear to the
ground to hear certain larrlng notes; one
does not have to observe closely to see
that there Is a political uneasiness about
tho "White House grounds that Is not
to be explained by tho fact that tho
picsldentlal election Is nearer by four
months than when the future seemed so
promising and so secure. Wherein lies
the chango and what Is the prospect for
regaining lost ground? These questions
present themselves insistently as the
politicians take stock of the situation
at tho beginning of a session which Is
to be by all odds the meat exciting and
the hardest fought of many years.
SOME OF THE REASONS.
Primarily, the I'resldent has notably
lost ground with tho women of the coun
try, and when It Is considered that they
aro now voting for president in eleven
of our States, tho significance of this Is
not to bo overlooked. Next, there Is a
surprising and, to nuns',, informed people,
an unjust wave of dissatisfaction with
our foreign policy, which is In such con
trast to the popular feeling of last sum
mer, and Is the more difficult to under
stand In view of tho remarkable change
for the better In Mexico, where the out
look Is fairly bright, thousands of exiles
roturnlns to their Mexican homes and a
belief existing that Moxlco will astonish
tho world by the rapidity of her recuper
ation from her revolutionary ills,
THE LUSITANIA CASE,
It Is tho question of the LuBitania settle
ment which still hangs lire wherever the
fault lies that seems to bo troubling many
people, particularly thoso who aro strong
ly anti-Gorman. Tho German-Amoricans,
on tho other hand, fool moro bitterly than
ever towards the President because of
what they consider his pro-ally partisan
ship. The sensible ones among them do
not defend, of course, the conspiracies of
the bomb-throwing kind, but thoy have
not been convinced by the long dolay
In tho Bonding of the British note, which
was pigeonholed from May to Novembor
against tho wishes of many olllcials In the
stato department, and has so fur produced
no tanglblo benefits for American trade.
Thoy aro disconcerted, too, by the fact
that stories had beon circulated among
them, for some three weeks before the
ovent happened, that Captain Boy-Ed and
Captain von Papon woro to go because of
a determination on tho part of tho ad
ministration to stiffen up Its foreign policy
beforo tho meeting of Congress, In order
to head off posslblo congressional criticism
by such men ns Senator Hoke Smith and
others of democratlo and republican faith.
BRITISH TRADE POLICIES.
Another cause of popular dissatisfaction
with tho administration is tho feeling of
many Importers and oxportorB who aro
Buffering from tho exactions and restric
tions of tho British trado policies that
constitute a blockado of the United States.
Thoy aro particularly not pleased with tho

HW1ENDINEK AND VON NUBER
NOW.
The department of Justice has ordered
Its agents to Investigate the charge that
tho Austrian chargo, Kwlondinck, and
Consul-General von Nuber attempted to
Bmugglo official papers to tho Vienna
government last Juno, using Marcus
Braun of Now York as go-between. Tho
department gavo consideration to the
matter to ascertain whether Braun, who
Is editor of tho Hungarian periodical,
Fair Play, used an American passport
during his trip to Europe.
Officials at tho department of Justice
had previously been Informed of the
charge nnd were In possession of a let
ter from Charge ttwlcndlnck, in which
tho latter asked for an explanation of
the alleged activities of Consul-General
von Nuber as reported to him. Tho In
formation In possession of the depart
ment's agents up to tho present time
does not connect tho namo of tho Aus
trian charge with the attempting smug
gling of papers and documents to the
Austrlnn government, and It was fur
ther stated to-day that thero Is no evi
dence showing that former Ambassador
Dumba, who until his recall represent
ed the Austrian government nt Wash
ington, is still carrying on the work of
tlie propaganda, although he Is no longer
accredited to this country.
For some tlmo past agents of tho de
partment of Justlco have been gathering
Information concerning the nctlvltics of
Von Nuber. which has been turned over
to the state department. This Informa
tion. It Is understood, relates chiefly to
violations of passport and neutrality
laws on tho part of Von Nuber and
his associates. It was on this account
and for the reason that .such evidence
was regarded as damaging, that Attorney-General
Gregory refused to listen
to the protest of the Austrian charge
I to the mention of Von Nubor's actlvl-
! ties in this country.

CAPTURE OF JEFF DAVIS.
Story Told by Michigan Private Just
Before Hlii Dentil.
The man who captured Jefferson Davis,
president of the Confederacy, after the
fall of Richmond, died In Washington
iecently. He was William P. Stedman,
a prlvato In the Ith Michigan regiment
during tho war between the North and
South. Mr. Stedman was 79 years old
and made his homo In Washington with
his son, Royal G. Stedman.
According to the story told by Mr.
Stedman, just before his death, he, with
14 others, wns sent to capture Davis,
and tho head of the Confederacy wns
taken on May 10, lfflj, about 10) miles
south of Macon, C.a.
On that morning, following directions
of a colored man, Stedman and his com
rades came upon a party of 2J persons,
Including Davir, his wife, three children,
two servants, four teamsters and a
dozon officers. Shortly nftcr their cap
ture Mrs. Davis asked Captain Hudson,
who was In command ol Htedman's
party, for permission for two of her
servants to go tu a nearby stream for
some water. Permission was granted.
Mr, Stedman's story of tho next phase
of the incident follows:
"I was on guard at the time and no
tlced that ono of the servants appeared
to be a colored woman, and the other,
unusually tall for a woman, wore a shawl
closely fastened around the head. They
started quickly toward tho stream. I
swung my liorse In a circle so aa to In
tercept them nnd crossed tho path about
two-thirds of the way from tho camp
to the stream. In response to my com
mand they halted and tho shawl covered
person glanced up at mo and revealed a
mustache, as I suspected. A question to
him assured me It was Davis, as I be
lieved, "I covered him with my revolver, when
he threw down the shawl and stood look
ing at mo with a gtln.
"Mrs. Davis, who proved to bo the
colored servant, seeing my gun leveled
at her husband, sprang toward mo say
Ins: 'Don't shoot, Mr. Soldier, he's un
armed.' "
Mr. Stedman ndded that tho head of
tho "Lost Cause" then seated himself
on a log and the soldier guarded him
until assistance arrived from tho ramp.
In 1SS3 Mr. Stedman came to Washing
ton and entered tho government service
In the weather bureau. Later ho was
transferred to tho office of the chief of
tlio bureau of animal industry, depart
ment of agriculture. In which position
he continued during tho remaining years
of his tcrvico for Undo Sam Roches
ter Times.

unless It can be brought under control
within the next two yenrs. This disease
has been known for somo years, having
been Introduced at many points on whlto
plno nurrcry stock Imported from Ger
many. The dlscaso first established It
self at Geneva, N. Y In 1C. In 1909 ex
tensive Importations of diseased white
plno nursery stock wcr. located and de
stroyed In Now York and other eastern
states and warnings Issued broadcast
against further Importation of white pine
from Europe. In spite of these warnings
Importation continued oven from tho par
ticular nursery In Germany which was
definitely known to be the main source
of disease, until finally In 1912 all such
Importation was stonned bv federal law.
Whether this law was passecV too lato
remains In l,n seen, ns It denenrls on
seen
whether tlio disease already established
In tho United States can be stamped out.
The white plno blister rust affects the
eastern whlto pine, the western white
pine, the sugar pine and, indeed, all of
tho so-called five-leaf pines, producing
cankers on tho stems and branches, kill
ing young trees nnd maiming and dis
figuring old ones. It also produces a leaf
disease of currant and gooseberry
bushes. The fungus causing tho disease
must live for a part of its llfo on pine
trees and part of its llfo on currants
and gooseberries. Tho disease cannot
spread from one pine tree to another,
but must pass first to currant bushes
and then back to pine.
In Europo tho disease has mado the
culture of American white pine imprac
tlcablo in England, Denmark, and Hol
land, nnd has seriously handicapped its
cultivation in Germany. Since the trees
which It attacks Include threo of tho
most Important timber trees of the Unit
ed
States, the loss which this disease
I will produce if unchecked is uncalculable.
Fortunately, the disease Is not now
known to be present west of Buffalo, N.
' Y., but Its ultimate spread to tho vast
I forests of tlie Rocky mountains and tho
I Pacific coast is certain If It Is not check
ed in the eastern States. The
disease
1 now occurs in three localities in
New
l Hampshire, two In Vermont, two in Con
necticut, flvo In New York, one In Penn
sylvania, and threo In Ontario, Canada.
At one point in Ontario, two in New
York, two in New Hampshire and two
in Massachusetts, tlie disease Is present
on currants In sufficient quantity to
be serious.
Tlio disease Is controllable nt tills stage

WHAT OUR NEIGHBORS SAY
Hoir to Encourage ilie InvrstliiB or
More Vermont Money In Vermont.
(From the Bennington Banner.)
Bank Comml?sloner Frank C. Williams
Is quoted by a Little Rock, Ark., paper as
saying that Vermont had saving, depos
its Juno 30 of J25,;a,21 and that Vermont
savings hanks have SIO.ftM.O'ti Invested In
other Stntes. Tho Little Rock paper has
apparently misquoted Mr Williams or has
gotten tho figures twl-t' d Savings de

probably upwards of ST'1 .W,fM Likewise

showing of the ability of Vermonters to
develop Individual nnd family prosperity
from rather meager sources, but It has a
shocking sldo nnd ono that Is disturbing
to patriotic Vermonrrs.
This unfortunate factor Is that Ver

for that reason hio glad to sco Vermont

Invest somo of their money beyond tho

proportion of this monsy to Increase tho
progress and prosperity of our own State.
Tho tax policy of Vermont for 30 years
lias been short-sighted nnd calculated to
cripple and stunt Vermont endeavor. It
seems to do no good to argue tho ques

VERMONT'S SUPREME COLTRT,
(From the St. Albans Messenger.)
A very ltitotciUlng article, accompanied
by a table, on "Tho Output of tho
Courts." nppars In the current Issue of
The Dockot, a publication designed for
lawyers. In the table accompanying the
article proper aro set forth the num
ber of opinions per year U9H Is taken M
the standard) handed down by tho sev
eral appellate courts In thn United
i Stales, the number of judges comprising
i eac" co"". tho average number of opln
Ions per Judge, and tlie nverago words
per opinion. Notice Is taken of tho av
erage vords per opinion because, to it
Is set forth, Judges arn becoming prolix,
nnd It is argued that "the length of opin
ions which are written must be reduced
by providing Judges the opportunity to
give more careful consideration to thn
preparation of each opinion which Is
written." Too many opinions aro Ill-considered
and this shows up In tho length,
It being urgUfd that exact knowledge
tends to conciseness, l.'ndoubtedly there
Is considerable In thin claim, although
to far as opinions aro concerned, some
states require that Judgment be pass
ed on every point raised, irrespective
! nt whether previous rulings aro a mat-
,er " Kunernl knowledge among the
i 'Ogni proiession or not.
The statistics presented in regard to
Vermont naturally aro Interesting to
Vermonters, and may serve to promote
some healthful discussion of court con-
! dltlons. The number of opinions handed
down In 1914 by the five Vermont Justices
was 94, an average of 19 opinions eacfc
for tho year. Tho a vet age number of
words per opinion was 3,102. These fig
ures by themselves mean nothing but
I tm'J' tale added Interest when brought
into comparison with the figures pre
sented by .other states. This comparison
shows that only four appellate courts
In the whole country had fewer opin
ions per judge, those in Ohio, Now
Hampshire, Delaware and Wyoming. In
other words, Vermont's justices are not
pressed with work when compared with
what Justices in other states are expect
ed to do.
It is also Interesting to read that the
Vermont justices hand down lengthy de
cisions, which The Docket, rightly or
j " rongly, considers nn undesirable prac
tlce In the main, nlthousrh It has to b
recognized that some cases must receivs
more attention than others. The opin
ions of only three other states are at
greater length, Utah, North Dakota and
Idaho, and In each of these states the
average of opinions per Justice Is much
higher than in ermont. bo rar as Ver
mont is concerned tno small numDer oi
cases per Justice does not seem to b
reflected In the length of opinions, for
Vermont Justices have few opinions to
writo and succeed In making them lonsr,
while The Docket works under tho Im
pression that ample time would result
In shorter and more conciso opinions.
If Vermont's supremo court wero re
duced to threo members Instead of tho
five, the number of opinions per Justice
would Jump from 19 to 31'-i, which is not
1 , , , , , ' ,
I blah n mmrar on with other states.
in comparison with other states.
Indeed, there aro 23 appellate courts
which handle more opinions per mem
ber than this, tho average being. It
would seem, well over 10. The reader
ought not to jump to the conclusion that
our supremo court has an easy tlmo of
It, even though the appearances point
to that conclusion. The Messenger Is
very frank to say that It cannot English
tfle.-c facts and figures to its own com
plete satisfaction. It does know that th
decisions of tho Vermont supreme court
havo for years been accepted with
respect by courts and lawyers all over
the country, bo that whatever the situ
ation may bo. tho highest court In the
State doe.3 good work. This of course Is
the main thing to be considered. It may
be that Vermont has struck the ideal
relation between the number of Judges
nnd the amount of work to be done. It
may be, however, that Just as good work
could be done by fewer men of tho same
caliber now on the bench. It would b
interesting to read the opinions of the
matter entertained by the lawyers of tho
Slate. The leading members of the legal
profession would be ablo to throw moro
light on this matter than could bo ex
pected from a layman who has before him
nothing but cold figures and Is unac
quainted with tho personal equation which
must be given Its place and proper re
lationship with the whole question.
LOANS IN VERMONT
(From the Rnndolph HeraJd.)
Our Stato bank commissioner nas Been
down In Arkansas bragging that the sav
ings banks of Vermont have H0,00rt,M0 In
vested outside the Stato. That proves the
extent of their deposits, but would It not
be better for Vermont of more of this
could somehow bo Invested within the
Stato? What Is Vermont doing to en
courage banks to loan In Vermont In
preference to making outside inxestments?
