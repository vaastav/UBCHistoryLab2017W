THE COURANT wishes to compliment
Col. Lounsberry, of The Fargo Argus,
tor not noticing the dirty fling of the
all-at-home-plate-print of the rag pub

NOTE AND COMMENT.
Valley City Times Record: It is said
that in one judicial district in North
Dakota there is a divorce syndicate
whose patrons have a sure thing. The
fees are pretty stiff, but the syndicate
is doing a good business. There is an
agent in New York who looks up the
matrimonial misfits and explains the
situation. The fees are split in four
pieces, according to reports, one part
going to the New York representative,
another to the local attorney, a third to
the hotel and the last quarter to the
judge. Decision is reserved until all
fees are paid.
And is it thus that the dignity
of our judiciary is to be so soon attacked
after Judge -Sauter strikes out a portion
of an affid ivit made before him on the
ground that the "dignity of the
judiciary" must be protected?

Editor Pierce, of The Walsh County
Record, is on a visit to California, and
thus writes to his paper
We arrived in San Francisco this
morning. Came over the Southern
Pacific. We will stop here until Friday.
Am at George Humphrey's office.
Have seen Will Cobb. Mrs. Cobb is
coming down to see Mrs. Pierce this
afternoon. Mr. Cobb is the master
elect of Mission Lodge A. F. and A. M.
During the past year they have made
150 Masons. They are to have a big
out" to-night. May go out.
THE COURANT merely copies the
above to compliment Mr. and Mrs.
Cobb upon their success in life in
making so many Masons. Bully for
Mr. and Mrs. Cobb.
POLITICAL POINTERS.
President McKinley's utterances on
the Cuban quesion are being com
mended by all classes of citizens and
members of all parties. There is an
evident feeling throughout the country
that his course has been so wise and
judicious that the entire matter can
with safety be left in his hands for such
future action as may be necessary.
President McKinley's currency prop
osition, outlined in his message, is so
•imple and yet seems likely to be so
effective in breaking the "endless
chain" which has so much disturbed the
Treasury and the business of the
country, that there is good reason to
hope that a sufficient number of
votes may be found to insure its passage
in the Senate, there being little doubt
as to its acceptance by the House.
The growth of the protection senti
ment in the South has received a new
impetus from the announcement that
the entire product of a new and large
cotton mill in Alabama has been con
tracted to be delivered in China. Thus
the South is reaping the benefit of the
protective system, which has made the
manufacture of cotton goods so suc
cessful as to not only supply the market
of the United States, but to now be
able to supply the markets of the
world.
The people who are urging immediate
legislation for an increase of the rev
enue are doing an injustice to the ex
isting law and to the business interests
of the country. The earnings under
the new law have with marked rapidity,
beginning with $19,000,000 in August,
and cunning up to over $25,000,000 in
November. The receipts now are
within about $5,000,000 a month of the
expenditures, and when it is remem
bered that the receipts from sugar,
wool, and woolens will not begin to be
ifelt until after the month of January,
but will average $8,000,000 or $7,000,000
a month, all told, it will be seen that
there is good reason to believe that the
law will meet all requirements, and
that the demand for additional legisla
tion at the present time is unfair and
unjust. At least the law should be
given sufficient time to show what it
can do.
The Democratic liars continue their
4enunciations of the Dingley law, based
'fepon absolute falsehoods. A sample
jpf this is found in a recent publication
mi the New YorkJournal, which, on the
*•&
ft
morning of the presentation of Presi
dent McKinley's message, said that
President McKinley "finds the Dingley
bill producing smaller revenues and
greater deficits than the measure his
platform denounced ever did." The
absolute falsehood of this statement is
shown from the official figures of the
Treasury Department, which set forth
that the receipts under the Dingley
law in its first four months are more
than |7,000,000 in excess of those of
the Wilson law during the first four
months of its history, being in the four
months in which it has been in opera
tion $90,517,114 against $88,038,007 pro
duced by the Wilson law in the corre
sponding period of its history.
It is proper to remark that those dis
tinguished Democratic editors who
showed signs of distress on the morn
ing following the announcement of
Secretary Gage's estimate of a deficit
of $21,000,000 in the fiscal year 1899 will
probably find that they have had their
trouble for nothing. Neither Secretary
Gage nor any of his assistants expects
that there will be a deficit of $21,000,000
or of any size in the fiscal year 1899.
On the contrary they expect a snrplus
of more than that sum. The fact is
that a new wrinkle in the law requires
the War Department to put into its fig
ures for the year the entire amount es
timated for by officers in charge of
river and harbor works, the result be
ing that the estimates for river and
harbor appropriations were over $60,
000,000 while nobody expects that the
appropriation will be for more than
one-fourth of that sum. So that it is
probable, indeed almost certain, that
the fiscal year 1899 will present a sur
plus of from $20,000,000 to $30,000,000
or perhaps more than that, despite the
facl that under the technical require
ments of the law the estimates are so
much in excess of what anybody ex
pects the appropriation of that year
will be.
NEW METHOD OF FARMING.
Bismarck Tribune: The Northern
Pacific road has announced the prize
winners for the best results with the
Campbell system of soil culture, and
Pat Lyons of Steele gets the first prize.
There have been several experimental
stations for the testing of this method
of soil culture the past season and the
indications are that another season will
see a more general adoption of the sys
tem. The results on the several stations
have been highly satisfactory, the aver
age yield being much higher than on
land cultivated by the ordinary method.
The superintendent of these farms
and the rpan who is held responsible
for their success or failure is H. W.
Campbell Mr. Campbell has pro
ceeded on the theory that if the moist
ure that falls on the plains can be
preserved there will be no trouble to
raise crops, and his manner of keeping
the water is by a frequent and deep
oulture of the soil. The farms that he
has managed this year have been
located in sections where there was
little likelihood of raising crops without
an exceptional season. The results
have shown that there is a chance for
the new system and farmers have taken
journeys to see the workings of the
farms have been satisfied that there is
something for them to learn.
Mr. Campbell proceeds on the theory
that the ground must be worked all the
time. He does not allow it to lie idle
for a minute and there is a demand for
the big teams and plows of the north
west in the first process. The soil-cul
ture method can be tried by any intelli
gent farmer and many will do it on
their own account next year. The im
plements required and used on the
forty-three farms this year are the plow,
the harrow, the drill and the cultivator.
The ground is plowed very deep—
sometimes eight or ten inches. This
is to stir up the subsoil and give the old
soil on top a chance to rest. After
plowing, the ground is packed either
with sharp-rimmed wheels made for
the purpose or with drills that answer
the same object. The soil-culture
method consists in a complete re
arrangement of the top seven inches
of earth, turning it as nearly bottom
side up as is possible. The plant food
in the soil at the end of the season very
largely is found concentrated in the top
four inches of earth and the principle
that is worked upon by the new
methods is to get down to the bottom of
the furrow, where it will receive the
conservation of the force that is in it
and feeds the plant roots. The rich
soil thus will be just where the plant
roots are growing and the full benefit
of the supply of strength.
Immediately after the plowing the
lower four inches must be packed as
closely as possible, so that the moisture
that is there can be kept for the long
summer days. By increased attraction
for the moisture that does come in the
early spring, rains will be gathered
more in the bottom of the furrow and
I the evaporation will be felt less.
I After the deep plowing and the eob
surface packing, the next important
step is to keep the upper two inches of
the soil loose and dry. This forms a
"dust blanket" to cut off the moist
earth below from the effects of the air.
Water cannot pass through the dry
earth from below. Therefore the
dust blanket saves the moisture of the
early rains for the whole use of the
plants. That it does all this is seen
from the effects of the method, for on

Christmas Presents
the farms in the northern part of the
State where the system was tried this
season, there has been a remarkable
crop. Farmers who think the crop is
ruined if the top of the ground is not
wet are surprised to see the plant
looking fine when there is a dry
blanket over the whole field. The
packer follows the plow and two or
three cultivations are necessary in the
fall whether it rains or not. This is so
foreign to all previous plans of the
farmers that there is a great disinclina
tion to follow the directions until they
have been demonstrated by actual prac
tice. After every rain there must be a
thorough harrowing, so that there can
be a return of the dust blanket—anoth
er innovation that is surprising to farm
ers who have followed old methods. By
observing these directions the experi
ment stations in North and South
Dakotas have obtained an increase of
from 30 to 50 per cent over the yield on
the farms around them.

of the Day..,
WASHINGTON, Dec. 11.—Chairman
Richardson of the Democratic caucus
has issued the following call for a
caucus:
"A caucus of Democratic members
and delegates of the house of represen
tatives is hereby called to meet in the
hall of the house on Tuesday evening,
Deo. 14, 1897, at 7:30 o'clock."
The caucus will consider the four
subjects of Cuba, Hawaii, finance and
bankruptcy, these subjects being speci
fied in the calL As to the action on
these a primary general understanding
has been reached among the Demo
cratic leaders. On the subject of Cuba
the sentiment is practically unanimous
in favor of a resolution favoring the
Recognition of Cuban Belligerency
and the caucus is likely to give expres
sion to this sentiment.
On financial questions the caucus
probably will take a position against
the several plans of financial reform
recommended by Secretary Gage.
There is no present purpose to con
sider the silver question as that is not
at issue in the legislation contemplated
by the Republican majority.
Opposition to the bankruptcy bill is
also contemplated by the caucus.
On the question of Hawaiian annexa
tion it is stated by those who have can
vassed the feeling on the Democratic
side that it is practically unanimous*
agafnst annexation either by treaty or
by legislation. ..
