DIPLOMATS SEEKING ACCEPTABLE SUBSTITUTE

L
Hughes Wants to Give
Solons Chance to Let
Ideas Become Known.
Foreign Powers After
U. S. to Enter Pact on
Far East Questions.
Washington, Dec. 6.— (By The As
sociated Press).—The effort to find
an acceptable substitute for the Anglo
Japanese alliance has so diverted the
nttention of many of the arms dele
gates as to throw even the .question
of the naval ratio temporarily into the
background.
Both the Japanese and British have
shown a desire to include the United
States in an entente that may replace
the alliance, and a tentative treaty
draft under consideration by some gov
ernments concerned would provide for
a quadruple arrangement, also includ
ing France.
U. S. Delegates Silent
What may have been the attitude of
the Américan delegates in the behind
the-scenes developments having to do
with the proposal remains a mystery.
Taking the position that no entente
Suggestion is "formally" before them
the American representatives stead
fastly refused to discuss publicly the
possibility of American participation in
a political agreement regarding the
far east
In the absence of an .authoritative
explanation of the American view
point, the impression is gained by the
delegates of other powers that the
American plenipotentiaries are feeling
their way very cautiously as they seek
to ascertain what course would be in
accord with American official and
public opinion.
Recognizing the senate's claim to
partnership in the shaping of inter
national agreements, Secretary Hughes
and his colleagues are said to be
solicitious that the sentiment of the
treaty-ratifying branch of the govern
ment, as well as that of the executive,
shall be taken into account. How an
accurate canvass of senate opinion
could be made in the midst of the
negotiations, however, presents still
another puzzle.
"A gentleman's agreement"' or "un
derstanding" if that diplomatic instru
ments were used in the place of a
treaty, would not require senate con
firmation, but President Harding and
other administration officials have in
dicated they do not propose to take
steps which senators might regard as
ignoring the senate's claim to partici
pate in international policies.
All of these considerations are be
ing weighed carefully by the foreign
delegates who desire to have the
United States a party to the next far
eastern concert of nations. There have
been indications that the other powers
concerned would prefer that the agree
ment be put into the form of a treaty,
hut it remains to be seen how far
they Will press the suggestion when
they understand fully the American
constitutional system.
Naval Dispute Delayed
Some clue to help solve the riddle
may be given in the near future by the
senate itself. Speculation as to what
course the negotiations may take is
growing among senators as they come
together for the new session, and sev
eral have indicated they might seek :n
a senate debate to bring the question
of an entente more conspicuously be
fore the public. . .
The naval ratio negotiations still
are at a standstill while the Japanese
delegates wait for word from Tokio.
It may be several days before they are
in a position to resume the naval dis
cussions. The full committee of the
whole on the far east will meet again
Wednesday after a recess of five days
and will proceed with its discussions
of Chinese problems.

FAVOR OF
E
Claims Harding Fails
to Understand Labor
Conditions at Present.
Calls Attention to the
Situation in Kansas
Where Law Is Used.
Washington, Dec. 6.—President
Harding's suggestion, made in his mes
sage to congress, Tuesday, for a court
to decide wages and conditions of em
ployment, was declared to be "rever
sion to conditions obtaining more than
400 years ago." in a statement issued
Tuesday night by Samuel Gompers,
president of the American Federation
of Labor. ,
Does Not Understand.
"The president's message is in most
respects an admirable documents," the
statement said, "but he, like altogeth
er too many men, fails in his under
standing of relations between workers
and employers, of * * * * the aspira
tions which were in the hearts and
minds ot the great mass of « hit
pie.
"Indeed, the presidents proposal
for the establishment of a court with
legal powers to decide at; to wages
and conditions of employment, is noth
ing more or less than a reversion back
to the conditions obtaining more than
400 years ago when the court of quar
ter sessions determined the wages of
i workers and prohibited them from ask
ing for more or employers from pay
ing more than the court's decision and
to condemn mon to compulsory servi
tude and slavery if they resented in
anv way the decision of the courts.
♦ » ♦ *
Refers to Kansas.
"It is quite evident that the presi
dent has in mind the establishment of
a court or courts to determine the con
dition and wages of working people and
evidently with the aim that these
courts will prevent strikes and lock
outs. Surely the experience of such
courts in the Australian countries,
and the experience with such a court
in Kansas, should have been a lesson
for us. In New Zealand and in other
Australian countries they have gone
through the experience of more than
20 years and their utter failure has
not only been recognized there but
they have been abandoned. In Kansas
where such a court lias been in ex
istence for two years there are today
more strikes and more mem on strike
than at any time in the history of
Kansas."
Chinese Delegates
Advised to Stand
Firm in Demands
Washington, Dec. 6.—(By The As
sociated Press.)—The Chinese delega
tion to the armament conference, it
was learned Tuesday, has received ex
plicit instructions from the Peking
government not to recede from its po
sition for the unconditional return of
the Kiao Chau lease hold in Shantung
and to protect China's interest in Man
churia. Many cablegrams are being
received daily from various organiza
tions in China to the same effect.
It was said by Chinese spokesmen
Tuesday that should the Shantung
"conversations" result adversely to
China's interests, the delegation might
have to consider withdrawing.
It was emphasized there was no
present intention of doing so.

;
St. Paul, Dec. 6.—Announcement that national guard troops have been
called out Wednesday to patrol the packing plant district in South St. Paul
where close picketing by striking employes has prevented the iise of strike
breakers, was made Tuesday night.
The announcement was made at the adjutant general's office after
Adjutant General W. F. Rhinow had conferred over the telephone with
Governor J. A. O. Preus, who is in Washington, D. C.
Catling out of the troops follows unsuccessful attempts of both the Swift
and Armour companies to bring in men to take the place of strikers, and after
conferences with labor leaders had failed to effect an agreement for a dis
continuance of the picketing.
Four hundred members of St. Paul companies of the guard will be sent
to South St. Paul as soon as they can be mobilized. It was said eanly Tues
day night that the first troops would arrive there about midnight.
Major J. L. Lewis will be battalion commander and Adjutant General
Rhinow will take personal charge, with Lieutenant Colonel E. A. Walsh,
assistant adjutant general, assisting him.
About 200 men will be sent to the Swift plant and 200 others to the
Armour plant. Motor trucks are rushing cots and supplies.
Arrangements have been made to house the men in buildings at the plants
and at the stockyards.
General Rhinow said he informed Governor J. A. O. Preus that the strikers
and pickets had failed to keep a promise made to him earlier in the day that
pickets wou!d allow workers access to and from their places of employment
without molestation.
Martial law has not been declared.
Companies A, B, C and D, of the Sixth infantry of St. Paul and the
headquarters company of the third battalion of the Sixth infantry of -St.
Paul park were ordered to mobilize at the St. Paul armory. All motor
trucks and light equipment the national guard available in the Twin Cities
also were ordered to the "0mtr y.
The troops were ordered to carry their mess kits, blankets, cots, arms,
packs and 90 rounds of ammunition. All men of the headquarters and service
companies will be armed with pistols or rifles.
Lieutenant Colonel H. L. Brady, of the quartermaster department, was
instructed by General Rhinow to furnish equipment for the men.
It is now planned to call out more than the 400 troops, but arrangements
will be made so that more may be mobilized on short notice in case of necessity,
it was said. -
At Fort Worth, Texas, two strike sympathizers were shot and wounded
and a negro who, it is said, did the shooting, was severely beaten.
At Omaha, Neb., missiles were thrown by various persons, including
women, in clashes between strike sympathizers and workmen.
At Chicago policemen with drawn revolvers held a crowd of 300 persons
at bay until reserves arrived, after arresting strike sympathizers said to have
beaten a workman. A man and his daughter, packing plant employes, were
twice attacked by strike sympathizers as they started to leave a packing plant
and several arrests were made for minor disturbances.
While little violence was reported at Kansas City, Kansas, the district
leader of the union men in an address defied the Kansas court of industrial
relations to stop the strike, asserting he would rather go to jail than give up.
Union officials asserted 6,000 more workers had joined the strikers' ranks
in Chicago, while the packers reported that between 90 and 95 per cent of
their men were working and that Ihe places of strikers had been filled from
the hundreds of unemployed applying for work.
Cornelius Hayes, president of the meat workers, said 12,000 workmen
were on strike here. He salo no definite figures were available for other
sections, but that more men were out than on Monday when the union esti
mated 29,000 workmen were on strike outside Chicago.
I Know You Never Loved"
Says Mrs. Obenchain In Her
Letter to Murdered Broker
Los Angeles, Dec. 6.—Reading of
letters written by Mrs. Madalynne
Obenchain occupied almost the entire
session Tuesday of trial of Arthur C.
Burch, for the alleged murder of J.
Beltoin Kennedy. The letters were ad
dressed to Kennedy and ranged in
their tone from expressions of pas
sionate fondness to bitter denuncia
tion.
Their dates ranged from early in
1917 to July 19 last, less than three
weeks before the time the prosecution
contends Burch shot and killed Ken
nedy with the knowledge and conni
vance of Mrs. Obenchain.
One letter dated Coronado, Cal., in
June. 1918, was signed "Mrs. J, ^el
ton Kennedy," the handwriting having
been identified as that of Mrs. Oben
chain who was then Miss Madelynne
Connor. Half a dozen others contain
ing expressions of affection, also dat
ed in 1918. followed. Then came a
jump to February, 4, 1919, or about a
month after the writer married Ralph
R. Obenchain of Chicago. This letter,
dated in Los Angeles, and addressed
to Kennedy, in this city, contained
these passages:
"How life has changed. * * * *. Lit
tle did I dream that man made laws
could bind me so closely to another.
» » * » Dear heart, believe in- a here
after for I know there is something
beyond this."
A subsequent letter dated in the
same month contained this passage:
"You and I know why all this had
to be. Keep faith and pray."
A letter dated Los Angeles, May 7,
1919, invited Kennedy to eall on the
writer at a downtown hotel and was
signed "Your sweetheart wife."
A letter dated Evanston, Ills., Oct
ober 7, 1919, read:
"Have talked with R. all afternoon
and will try to get an annulment at
oace. *.;*** He has consented to
let me fjp."
Subsequent letters urged Kennedy to
go to Chicago, one dated December 27,
1919, containing the statement:,
'If you are not here by January 16,
wU L g0 , ,? • îf' I" ebru
ary 23, following there was another,
stating, have discarded the name
Obenchain. * * * Play the part
of a gentleman and return my let
On May 1, 1920, Mrs. Obenchain
wrote, telling Kennedy not. to go to
Chicago, declaring he "had his chance,"
and again asked for h*r letters. An
undated letter was next introduced,
in which she wrote she would have
her annulment in a few weeks. "It
almost kills me to see how U. takes
it," she added, and in thp same letter
wrote:
"R. does not know how soon I nm
going to marry." In another uiidated
letter, the writer declared she had told
"R." she was to be married to Ken
nedy within a few weeks. "I want
you to wire immediately if you are
coming here," she continued. "I have
told R. that unless you come for" me
in a few weeks I will go back to him."
On July 17 last, at Los Angeles,
Mrs. Obenchain wrote to Kennedy:
"I know you have never loved. You
will never see or hear from me again."
Two days later she wrote a letter ask
ing him to forgive her. "I know you
love me," the letter read. "You have
been wonderful. Truly in my heart
I have never doubted you."
■When the last letter was written,
according to other testimony, Mrs.
Obenchain had wired Burch in Chicago
to come to her in Log Angeles and he
had replied he would do so.
J. D. Kennedy, father of the slain
man, was on the witness stand when
the letters were being read, identify
ing them as having been found either
in his son's room or safety deposit
box.
Obenchain, who is counsel for his
former wife, whose trial is scheduled
to follow that of Burch, was in court
while the letters were being read.

Recommends Passage
of Liberal Mining and
Land Regulations.
Washington. Dec. 6.—More liberaliz
ed laws with an administration co
ordinated and brought nearer home is
the paramount need of Alaska, Gov
ernor Scott C. Bone said in his first
annual report made public Tuesday by
the interior department.
"Capital and people are required to
develop the resources of the territory,"
he said, "and until it is made easier
for these two necessary factors to ob
tain a foothold the territory will not
progress. Under the present long
range system of government individual
initiative has been halted and the pio
neer spirit maimed."
Centralize Administration
To promote efficiency by minimizing
delays, the governor recommends that
the administration be centralized at
Juneau, the territorial capital, to the
fullest extent possible while govern
ment supervision be maintained at
Washington with the various bureaus
dealing with the territory consolidated

Distress Signals
From Unknown Ship
Picked Up at Sea
»San Francisco, Dec. 6.—Distress
signals from an unidentified steamer
were picked up early Tuesday at
Point Conception, 238 miles south of
San Francisco and were forwarded to
the marine department of the local
chamber of commerce.
"Steamer passing south blowing
distress signals, also flashing lights,"
said advices received shortly after
2 a', m.
"Probably machinery disabled. Go

The steamer presumably is a small

Century-Old Quarrel Is
Ended by Signing of
British-Irish Treaty.
Pact Will Be Subject
to Ratification by
English Parliament.
London, Dec. 6.—(By The
Associated Press).—The cen
turies-old quarrel between Eng
land and Ireland was ended,
as had been fervently hoped,
! in the small hours of Tuesday
I morning by the signature in
j the premier's cabinet room of
"a treaty between Great
j Britain and Ireland", consisting
of 18 articles, giving Ireland
the title of Irish Free State
and the same constitutional
status as Canada, Australia,
and other overseas dominions.
The question of allegiance, which up
to the last moment threatened to
wreck the negotiations, was surmounted
by permitting the members of the Irish
parliament to swear allegiance to the
constitution of the Irish Free State and
"be faithful to his majesty the king.'
Subject to Ratification
The treaty has yet to run the gaunt
let of the Ulster government and of the
imperial parliament. The imperial par
liament has been summoned to meet
December 14, and will he opened in
state by the king, who has taken the
closest personal interest in the Irish
negotiations since he practicaJy insti
gated them when he opened the Ulster
parliament.
Approval by the imperial parliament
is a foregone conclusion, as the govern
ment has an overwhelming majority in
the house of commons favoring the
Irish policy, and the action of the Brit
ish representatives in reaching the
agreement has already been unanimous
ly endorsed by the cabinet. The posi
tion of Ulster is less certain. Evidence
comes from Belfast Tuesday night that
the treaty will be subjected to the most
searching examination before receiving
assent, and doubtless many modifica
tions will be proposed.
Lloyd George Praised
The king hastened to send the pre
mier a telegram congratulating him on
