Special McHxatce.
A Special Hawaiian Message.
It is hardly necessary for me to state
that the questions arising from our rela
tions with Hawaii have caused serious em
barrassment.
Just prior to the Installment of the pres
ent administration the existing government
of Hawaii had been suddenly overthrown
and a treaty of annexation had been ne
gotiated between the provisional govern
ment of the islands and the United States
and submitted to the senate for ratification.
This treaty I withdrew for examination,
and dispatched Hon. James H. Blount of
Georgia to Honolulu as a special commis
sioner to make an impartial investigation
of the circumstances attending the change
of government and of all the conditions
bearing upon the subject of the treaty.
After a thorough and exhaustive examina
tion Mr. Blouut submitted to me his re
port, showing beyond all question that the
constitutional government of Hawaii had
been subverted with the active aid of our
representative to that government and
through the intimidation caused by the
presence of an armed naval force of the
United States, which was landed for that
purpose at the instauce of our minister.
Upon the factH developed, it seemed to me
the only honorable course for our govern
ment to pursue was to undo the wrong that
had been been done by those representing
us, and to restore as far as practicable the
status existing at the time of our forcible
Intervention. \Vith a view of accomplish
ing this result within the constitutional
limit of executive power and recognizing
all our obligations and responsibilities
It is estimated that on t&e day qt July,
1893, the metallic stock of money Jj) the
United States, consisting of coin and bullion,
amounted to $1,213,559,109, of which $597,
697,685 was gold and $015,801,481 was sil
ver. One hundred and nineteen national
banks were organized during the year ended
Oct. 31, 1893, with a capital of $11,230,000.
Forty-six went into voluntary liquidation
and 158 suspended. Klxty-fivu of the sus
pended banks were Insolvent, eighty-six re
sumed business and seven remained liji the
hands of bank examiners, with prospects of
speedy resumption. Of the new banks or
ganized forty-four were located in the K\st
ern states, forty-one west of the Mississippi
river and thirty-four in the Central and
Southern states. The total number of na
tional banks Jn existence on the 31st day
of October, 1893. was 3.790. having an ag
gregate capital of $695,fi5S,l20. The net in
crease In the circulation of t&ese banks
daring the year was $30,880,972.
Sliver Purchase Repeal,
The recent repeal of the provision of law
requiring the purchase of silver bullion by
the government as a feature of our mone
tary scheme has made an entire change in
the complexion of our currency affairs, and
I do Dot doubt that the ultimate result of
this action will be most salutary and far
reaching. In the nature of things, however,
it is Impossible to know at this time pre
cisely what conditions will be brought about
cisely what conditions win De orongat aoouc

the Subject
of
Washington, Dec. 4.—President Cleveland's
annual message, which was read iu oon
gre=t»~ soon after that body eonvetied at
noon for its llfty-thlrd regular session, Is
as follows:
To the Congress of the United States:
Th»» constitutional duty which requires the
president l'roui time to time to give the con
gress Information of the state of the I'uion
and recommend to their consideration such
matters as he shall judge necessary Is fit
tingly entered upon by commending to the
congress a careful examination of the
detailed statements and well-supported rec
ommendations contained iu the reports of
the heads of departments who are chiefly
charged with the executive work of the
government. In an effort to abridge this
communication as much as is consistent
with its purpose, I shall supplement a brief
reference to the contents of these depart
mental reports by the mention of such
executive business and incidents as are not
embraced therein, and by such recommend
tions as nppear to be at this particular
time appropriate.
While our foreign relations have not at
all times during the past year been entirely
free from perplexity, no einbarrasslrg situ
ations remain that will not yl.eld to the spir
it of fairness and love which characterize
a truly American foreign policy.
Of the outbreak iu I'.razil the president
s:!j's: The struggle is between the estab
lished government, which controls the ma
chinery of administration, and with which
we maintain friendly relations, and certain
officers of the navy employing the vessels of
their command in an attack upon the
national capital and chief seaport, and
lacking, as it does, the elements of divided
administration, I have failed to see that
the insurgents can reasonably claim rec
ognition as beligerents. Thus far the posi
tion of our government, has been that of an
attentive but impartial observer of the un
fortunate ooulllct.
The questions affecting our relations with
Great Britain have been treated in a spirit
cf friendliness. Negotiations are in progress
between the two governments with a view
to such concurrent action as will make the
award and regulations agreed upon by the
Bering sea tribuual of arbitration practi
cally effective, and it is not doubted that
Great ISriraiu will co-operate freely with
this country for the accomplishment of
that purpose. The dispute growing out
of the documentary tolls imposed in the
Welland canal upon cargoes of cereals
bound to and from the lake ports of the
United States was adjusted by the substitu
tion of a more equitable schedule of
charges, and my predecessor thereupon sus
pended his proclamation Imposing discrim
inating tolls upon British transit through
our canals. A request for additions to the
list of extraditable'offenses covered by the
existing treaty between the two countries
la under consideration.
growr
Ing out of any changed condition brought
about by our unjustifiable interference, our
present minister at Honolulu has received
appropriate inductions to that end. Tims
far no information of the accomplishment
of any definite results lias been received.
When received they will be promptly sent
to congress, together with ail other informa
tion at hand, accompanied by a special ex
ecutive message fully detailing all the facts
necessary to a complete understanding of
the case, and presenting a history of all the
material events leading up to the present
situation.'
The Treasury Department.
The secretary of the treasury reports that
the receipts of the government from all
sources during the fiscal year ended June 80,
1893, amounted to SM»1.716.MJt.D4, and Its
expenditures to $450,374,(574.29.
There was collected from customs $205,
3.ri5.010.7.1 and from Internal revenue $101,
027.02.1.9.1. Our dutinble buports amounted
to ij'4'21,850.711, an increase of $f2,45.1,t)07
otev the preceding year, and importations
free of duty amounted to $441,544,211, a de
crease from the preceding year of $13,45."i,
447. Internal revenue receipts exceeded
those of the preceding year by $7,147,415.32
Tlie total tax collected on distilled splits
was £94.720,200.55 on manufactured tobacco
$31,889,711.74, and on fermented liquors,
$32,-548,983.07. We exported merchandise
during the year, amounting to $S47,U0o,194, a
decrease of ?!i2,G12,9-"4 from the preceding
year. The amount of gold exported was
larger than any previous year in the history
of the government, amounting to $108,080,
844, and exceeding the amount exported dur
ing the preceding year by "8,485,517. The
sum paid from the treasury for sugar boun
ty was $9,375,130.88. an increase over the
preceding year of $20,335,309.
It is estimated upon the basis of present
revenue laws that the receipts of the gov*
eminent for the year ending June 30, 1804,
will be $430. 121,305.CS and Its expenditures
$458.121."05.oS, resulting In a deficiency of
$28,000,000. On the 1st day of November,
1893, the amount of money of all kinds iu
circulation, included in treasury holdings,
was $1,718,544,082, an increase for the year
of $112,404,947. Estimating our population
at 07,42(3,000 at the time mentioned, the per
capita circulation was $25.4'.). On the same
date was in the treasury gold bullion
amounting to $90,057,273, and 6Uvea- bullion
which was purchased at a cost, of $120,201,
553.
The purchase of silver under the Jaw of
July 14. 1890, during the last fiscal year, ag
gregated 54,008,102.59 fine ounces, which
cost $45,531,374.53. The total amount of sil
ver purchased from Ihe time that the law
became operative until the repeal of its pur
chasing clause, .on Hie 1st dyy of November,
1893. was 10S.G7-f.W0.40 fine ounces, which
cost $155,930,940.84 between the 1st day of
March, 1S73, and the 1st day of November,
18!3, the srovernmeut purchased under olj
laws 503.003,717 fine ounces of silver at a
jost of $510,022,948. The silver dollars that
have been coined under the act of July 14,
1890, number 30,087.285. The seigniorage
arising from such coinage was 0,977,098.39
leaving on lianl in the mints 140.699,700 fine
ounces of silver which cost $120,578,218.
Our total coinage of all metals during the
last, fiscal year consisted of 97.280,!- 7-". pieces,
valued at $43,0&3,17S-80, of which there was
$30,038,140 in gold coit, $5,343,715 iu silver

When, however, through this restored con

leading to a permanently sound currency,
abuudautly sulllclent to meet every require

should resolutely turn away from alluring
and temporary expedients, determined to be

and eonpiehensive financial plan. In these

l'ostofilce Department.
The report of the postmaster general con
tains a detailed statement of the operations
of the postotiice department during the last
fiscal year, and much interesting informa
tion touching this important Lranch of the
public service. That there was u larger dis
crepancy than usual between the posiofflcc
receipts and expenditures Is the "expected
and unavoidable result of the distressing
stringency which has prevailed throughout
the country during much of the time covered
by the postmaster general's report. At a.
date when better times were anticipated it
was estimated by his predecassors that the
deficiency on the 30th day of June, 1893,
would be a little over $l,b00,000. Ib
amounted, however, to little over $0,000,
000. At the same time, and under the in
fluence of like anticipations, estimates were
made for the current fiscal year ending
June 30, 1894, which exhibited a s-nrplus or
revenue over expenditures of $872,215.71
but now, in view of the actual receipts
and expenditures during that part of the cur
rent fiscal year already expired, the present
postmaster general estimates that, at its
close, Instead of a surplus
Tliere Will De a Deficiency
of nearly $8,000,000. The postoffloe receipts
for the last fiscal year amounted to $75,806,
9.13.16 and Its expenditures to $81,074,104.90.
This postofflce deficiency would disappear, or
be immensely decreased If less matter was
carried free through the mails, an Item of
which is upward of 300 tons of seeds and
grain from the agricultural department
The total number of postofflces in the
United States on the 30th day of June, 1893,
was 6S.403, an increase of 1.284 over the
preceding year. Of these 3,360 were presi
dential, an Increase in that class of 204 over
the preceding year, l-orty-two free delivery
offices were added during the year to "those
already existing, making a total of 610 cities
June 30, 1893. Ninety-three other cities and
towns are now entitled to this service un
der the law, but it has not yet been ac
corded them on account of insufficient funds
to meet the expense of its establishment.
The railway mail service not only adds to
the promptness of mail delivery at all of
fices, but It Is the especial Instrumentality
which puts the smaller and way places in
the service on an equality In that regard
with the larger and terminal offices. This
branch of the postal service has, therefore,
received much attention from Hie postmaster
general, and, though It Is gratifying to know
that it Is In a condition of high efficiency
and great usefulness, I am led to agree with
the postmaster general that there is room
for Its further Improvement.
The Navy Department.
The report of the secretary of the navy
contains a history of the operations of his
department during the past year and ex
hibits a most gratifying condition of the
personnel of our -navy. He presents a
satisfactory account of the progress which
had been made in the construction of ves
sels and makes a number of recommenda
tions to which attention is specially in
vited. During the past six months the de
mands for cruising vessels have been many
and urgent. There have been revolutions,
calling for vessels to protect Ameri
can Interests in Nicaragua, Gautemala,
Costa Itica, Honduras, Argentina and Bra
zil. while the oonditlon of affairs in Hono
lulu lias required the constant presence of
one or more ships. With all these calls
upon our navy It became necessary, In or
der to make up a sufficient fleet to patrol
the Bering sea under the modus vfvendi
agreed upon with Great Britain, to detail
to that service one vessel from the fish
commission and three from the revenue ma
rine.
The following vessels of the new navy
have been completed and are now ready
for service: The double turreted ooast de
fense monitor Miantonomoh, the double
turreted coast defense monitor Monterey,
the armored cruiser New York, the pro
tected cruisers Baltimore, Chicago, Phila
delphia, Newark, San Francisco, Charles
Con, Atlanta and Boston, the cruiser De
troit, the gunboats Yorktown, Concord,
Bennington, Macliias, Castiue and Petrel,
the dispatch vessel J)olphln, the practice
vessel Bancroft and the dynamite gunboat
Vesusivius. Of these the Bancroft, Ma
chlas, Detroit and Castlne have been placed
In commission during the current calendar
year.
'The following vessels are in progress of
construction: The second-class battleships
Maine and Texas, the cruisers Montgomery
and Marble head and the coast defense
monitors Terror, Puritan, Amphitrlte and
Monaduock, all of which will be completed
within one year the harbor defense ram
Katahdin and the protected cruisers Co
lumbia, Minneapolis, Olympia. Cincinnati
and Raleigh, all of which will be completed
prior to July 1, 1895 the first-class battle
ships Iowa. "Indiana. Massachusetts and
Oregon, wlileh will be completed Feb. 1,
1890. and the armored cruiser Brooklyn,
which will be completed Aug. 1 of that
year. It is also expected that the three
gunboats authorized by the last congress
will be completed In less than two years,
immigration.
The superintendent of immigration,
through the secretary of the treasury, re
ports that during the last fiscal year there
arrived at our ports ^40,793 immigrants.
Of the=se 1.003 were not permitted to land
under the limitations of the law, and 577
were returned to the countries from which
they came by reason of their having become
public charges. The total arrivals were
141.034 less than for the previous year.
The admonitions of tne last two years
touching our public health and the demon
strated danger of the introduction of con
tagious diseases from foreign ports has In
vested the subject of national quarantine
with increased interest. A more general
and harmonious system than now exists,
acting promptly and directly everywhere
and constantly operating by preventlvq
means to shield our country from the in
vasion of disease and at the same time
having dqe regard to the rights and duties
of local agencies, would, I believe, add
greatly to the safety of our peopie.
Sep. Coast Defenses.
It is gratifying to note that we hare be
gun to attain complex results In tne com
prehensive scheme of sea coast defenses
and fortification entered upon eight years
ago. A large sum has been expended, but
the cost of maintenance will be Inconsider
able as compared with th*' expense of con
struction and ordnance and at the end of
the current calendar year, the war depart
ment will have nine 12-inch guns, twenty
10-inch and thirty-four 8-lnch guns ready
to be mounted oh gun lifts and carriages,
and seventy-live 12-inch mortars.
The manufacture of heavy ordnance keeps
pace with current needs, but to render these
guns available for the purposes they are
designed to meet emplacements must be
prepared for them. Progress has been made
in this direction and it is desirable that
congress by adequate appropriations should I
provide for the uninterrupted prosecution
of this necessary work.
Abolish th® Pee System*
The report of the attorney general con
tains tbi usual summary of the affairs and
proceedings of the departme.it of justice for
the past year, together with certain recom
mendations as to needed legislation on vari
ous subjects, I cannot too heartily indorse
the proposition that the fee system, as
applicable to the compensation of United
States attorneys, marshals, clerks of federal
courts and United States commissioners,
should be abolished with as little delay as
possible. It Is clearly in the interest of the
community that the business of the courts,
both civil and criminal, shall be as small
and as inexpensively transacted as the
ends of justice will allow. The system is,
therefore, thoroughly vicious which makes
the compensation of court officials depend
upon the volume of such business, and thus
creates a conflict between a proper execution
of the law
anid
«,niho»
private gain, which cannot
fail to be dangerous to the rights and free
dom of the citizens, an irresistible tempta

I also heartily join the attorney general

of federal jurisdiction, as has been done in
nispy of pie states, authorizing writs of
error on behalf i)t the government in cases
where final judgment is rendered against
the sufficiency of an indictment or against

arising before actual trial limiting the

the
8ecFetary
of agriculture
will be found exceedingly interesting, es
pecially to that large part of our citizens
intimately concerned in the agricultural oc-
•ons. In yjew of a depleted puftlte treasury
and the imperative demand of people for
economy in the administration of their gov
ernuient, the secretary has entered upon the
task of rationally reducing expenditures by
the elimination from the pay rolls of all
persons not needed for an efficient conduct
of the affairs of the department. During
thfi firgt a# tKa
Tlod of the flsedl year, ending
sponding
Jane 40, 1803. The secretary makes appar
epi his lntentipn to continue this rate of re­
duction by submitting estimates for the
next fiscal year less by $994,280 than those
for the present year.
The amount or the appropriation for the
bureau of animal Industry for the current
fiscal year is $850,000. The estimate for the
ensuing year Is $700,000. The regulations of
1892 concerning Texas fever have been en
forced during the last year, and the large
stock yards of the country have been kept
free from infection.
The total number of Inspections of cattle
for export during the past fiscal year was
611,542, The exports snow a falling off of
about 25 per cent from the preceding year,
the decrease occurring entirely in the last
half of the year. This suggests that the
falling off may have been largely due to an
Increase In tne price of American export
cattle during the year ending June 30, 1893.
Exports of inspected pork aggregated 20,
677,410 pounds, as against 38,152,874 pounds
for the preceding year. The tailing off in
this export was not confined, however, to
Inspected pork, the total quantity exported
in 1892 being 665,490,616 pounds, while In
1893 it was only 527,308,695 pounds.
The exports of agricultural products from
the United States for the fiscal year ending
June 30, 1892, attained the enormous fig
ure of $800,000,0(X) in round numbers, being
78.7 per cent of our total exports. In the
last fiscal year this aggregate was greatly
reduced, but, nevertheless, reached $615,
000,000, being 75.1 per cent of all American
commodities exported. A review of our
agricultural exports with special reference
to their destination, will show that In al
most every line the United Kingdom of
Great Brltian and Ireland absorbs by far
the largest proportion. Of cattle, the total
exports aggregated in value for the fiscal
year ending June 30, 1893, $26,000,000, of
which Great Britian took considerably over
$25,000,000. Of beef products of all kinds,
our total exports were $28,000,000, of which
Great Britian took $24,000,000. Of pork
products the total exports were $84,000,000,
of which Great Britian took $53,000,000.
In bread stuffs, cotton and minor products
of like proportions sent to the- same desti
nation are shown.
In the year 1839 the congress appropri
ated $1,000, to be taken from the patent
office funds, for the purpose of collecting

gratuities at public cost.
Civil Service Reform.
The continued intelligent execution of the
civil service law and the increasing ap
proval by the people of its operation are
most gratifying. The recent extension of
its limitation and regulations to the em
ployes at the free delivery postofflces, which
has been honestly aud promptly accom
plished by the commission by the hearty
co-operation of the postmaster general, Is
an immensely important advance in the use
fulness of the system.
I am, if possible, more than ever con
vinced of the Incalculable benefits conferred
by the civil service law, not only in Its
effect upon the public service, but also,
what is even more important, in Its effect
in elevating the tone of political life gen
fcvally.
Since 1886 congress has at each session
authorized the building of one or more ves
sels, and the secretary of the navy pre
sents an earnest plea for the continuance
of this plan. He recommends the authori
zation of at least one battleship and six
torpedo boats. While I am distinctly in
favor of consistently pursuing the policy
we have inaugurated in building up a thor
ough and efficient navy, I can not refrain
from the suggestion that the congress
should carefully take Into account the uubi
ber of unfinished vessels on our hands and
the depleted condition of our treasury in
considering the propriety of an appropria
tion at this time to begin new work.
The Pension Dorean.
On the 30th day of June, 1893, there were
on the pension rolls 966,012 names, an in
crease of 89.944 over the number on the
rtll8 June 30, 1892. Of these there were
seventeen widows and daughters of revolu
tionary soldiers, 86 survivors of the war of
1812, 5,425 widows of soldiers of that war,
21,518 survivors and widows of the Mexican
war, 3,882 survivors and widows of Indian
wars, 284 army nurses and 475,645 survivors
and widows and children of deceased
soldiers and sailors of the War of the Re
bellion. The latter number represents
those pensioned on account of disabilities
or death resulting from army and navy
service. The number of persons remaining
on the rolls June 30, 1893, who were pen
sioned under the act of June 27, 1890,
which include also pensions on account of
death and disabilities not chargeable to
army service, was 459,555. The number
added to the rolls during the year was 123,
634, and the number dropped was 33,690.
The first payments on pensions allowed dur
ing the year amounted to $33,570,549.98.
This Includes arrears or the accumulation
between the time from which the allowance
of the pension dates and the time of act
ually granting the certificate. Although
the law of 1890 permits pensions for disa
bilities now related to military service, yet
as a requisite to its benefit a disability
must exist in incapacitating applicants
"from the performance of manual labor to
such a degree as to render them unable to
earn a support." The execution of this law
In Its early stages does not seem to have
been In accord with its true intention, but
toward the close of the last administration
au authoritative construction was given to
the statute, and since that time this con
struction has been followed. This has had
the effect of limiting the operations of the
law to its intended purpose. The discovery
having been made that many names bad
been put upon the pension roll by means of
wholesale and gigantic frauds, the com
mission suspended payments upon a num
ber of pensions which seem to be fraudu'ent
or unauthorized pending a complete exami
nation, giving notice to the pensioners Iu
order that they might have an opportunity
to establish, if possible, the justice of their
plalms, notwlthsanding apparent invalidity.
I am unable to understand why frauds in
the pension rolls should nut be exposed aud
corrected with thoroughness and vigor. Ev
ery name fraudulently jut unon these rolls
Is a wicked imposition upon the kindly sen
timent In which pensions have their orign.
The Indian*.
The coqdton of the Indlaus and their ulti
mate fate are subjects which are related to
a sacred duty of the goyerament. and which
strongly appeal to the sense of justice and
tli«» sympathy of our people. Our Indians
number about 248,000. Most of ihem are lo
cated on ftixtecq reservations containing 86,
11Q,531 acres qf land. Aboun 10,000 of
the$e Indiana have, to a large degrae,
adopted civilized customs. Lands in several
ly have bee^ allotted to many of theni.
s(h allotments have been made to 10,000
Individuals during the last fiscal year,
embracing about 1,000,000. The number of
Indian government schools open during the
year was 195, ap Increase of 12 over the pre
ceding year. Of this total 17 were on res
ervations, of which 73 were boarding schools
and 97 were day schools. Twenty boarding
schools and five day schools supported by
the government were not located on res
ervations. The total number of Indian chil
dren enrolled during the year as attendants
of all schools was 21,138, an Increase of
1,231 over the nrolUment for the previous
year.
The law providing that, except in special
cases, army officers shall be detailed as In
dian agents it is hopea will prove a suc
cessful experiment.
There Is danger of great abuses creeping
into the prosecution of claims for Indian
depredations, and I recommend that every
possible safeguard be provided against the
enforcement of unjust and fictitious claims
of this description.

t»e sheer recreancy. Nothing
should Interfere to distract our attention or
disturb our effort until this reform Is ac
complished by wise and careful legislation.
While we should staunchly adhere to the
principle that only the necessity of revenue
justifies the imposition of tariff duties and
other federal taxation, and that they should
be limited by strict economy, we cannot
close our eyes to the fact that conditions
have grown up 'among us in which justice
and fairness call for discriminating care in
the distribution of such duties and taxation
as the emergencies of our government
actually demand. Manifestly, if we are to
aid the people directly through tariff re
form one of the most obvious features
should be a reduction In present tariff
charges upon the necessaries of life. The
benefits or such a reduction would be pal
pable and substantial, seen and felt by the
thousands who would be better fed and bet
ter clothed and better sheltered. These gifts
should be the willing benefactions of a gov
ernment whose higher function is the pro
motion of the people. Not less closely re
lated to our people's prosperity and well
being is the removal of the restrictions
upon the importation of the raw materials
necessary to our manufacturers.
The world would be open to our ingenuity
and enterprise. This cannot be while fedral
legislation through the imposition of high
tariff forbids to American manufacturers as
cheap material as those used by their compe
titors. It is quite obvious that the enhance
ment of the price of our manufactured pro
ducts resulting from this policy not only
confines the market for these products with
in our own borders to the direct disadvan
tage of our manufacturers, but also in
creases their cost to our citizens. The inter
ests of labor are certainly, though indirect
ly, involved In this feature of our tariff
system. The sharp competition and active
struggle among our manufacturers to supply
the limited demand for their goods, soon fill
the narrow market to which they are cou
fined. Then follows a suspension of work In
mills and factories a discharge of employes
and distress in the homes of our working
men. Even if the often disproved assertion
could be made good, that a lower rate of
wages would result from free raw material
and low tariff, does the intelligence of our
workingmen lead them quickly to discover
that their steady employment permitted by
free raw material is the most important
factor in their relation to tariff legislation,
A measure has been prepared by the up
proprlate congressional committee emobdy
Ing tariff reform on the lines nercln sug
gestcd, which will be promptly submitted
for legislative action. It is'the result of
much patriotic and unselfish work, and
believe it deals with its subject as consist
ly and thoroughly as existing conditions
permit. I am satisfied that he redncd tar
Iff duty provided for in the proposed legis
lation added to the existing Internal reve
uue taxation, will in the near fuure,
hough, perhaps, not immediately, produce
sufficient revenue to meet the needs of th
government. The committee, after full con
sideration, and to provide against a tempo
rary deficiency which may exist before the
business of the country adjusts itself to
the new tariff schedules, have wisely em
braced In their plan a few additional in
ternal revenue taxes, Including a small tax
upon Incomes derived from certain corpo
rate investments.
The new assessments are not only abso
lutely Just and easily borne, but they have
the rurthernieut of being such as can be re
mitted without unfavorable disturbance
whenever the necessity of their Imposition
no longer exists. In my great desire for the
success of this measure I cannot restrain
the suggestion that if success can only be
attained by means of unselfish counsel on
the part of the friends of tariff reform, and
as a result of their willingness to snbordl
nate personal desires and ambitions to the
general good. The local Interest affected by
the proposed reform are so numerous and
so varied that If all are Insisted upon the
legislation embodying the reform must In
evltably fail.
In consluslon my intense feeling of re

SUPERSTITIONS OF THE SEA
Slgoi That Terrify Jack Tare Who
Believe in Witchcraft.
A sense of unreality, weirdness and
sometimes of uncanny feeling actuates
nearly every one connected -with the
sea, tliis being particularly strong on a
moonlight night, when the water of the
ocean looks more cruel* if, withal, more
beautiful than at any other time, says
the Boston Transcript. Then it is that
a ring around the moon is frequently to
be observed, and the sailors believe
that this is a sure sign of bad weather,
while Longfellow, in his "Golden
Legend," interprets it thus:
"I pray thee put in yonder port,
For I fear a hurricane
Last night the moon had a golden ring,
And to-night no moon we see."
We have often noticed how quaint
the fisher-folks are who live in solitary
places near the ocean, and this is true
to a greater or less extent of all dwell
ers by the sea. It is believed on Cape
Cod and in many other districts along
the New England coast that a sick man
cannot die until the ebb tide begins to
run. Watchers by beds of sickness
anxiously note the change of the tide,
and if the patient lives until the turn,
he will live until the next ebb. The
best educated and most intelligent peo
ple on the New England coast are not
entirely free from this superstition, and
to them there is a vivid meaning in
Dicken's description of the death of
Barkis, "And it being high water, he
went out with the tide."
The belief that the ninth or tenth
wave was more powerful than the oth
ers has existed since Ovid's time, who
says: "The wave that is now coming
o'ertops all the others 'tis the wave
that comes after the ninth and before
the tenth." Even nowadays at the sea
shore you will hear people counting the
waves and saying that the next one
will be the biggest Fishermen ou our
own coast think that the swell some
times noticed during a fog Is caused by
it, and they call It the fog-swell while
in reality it is simply the incoming tide
but fog is associated with such terrible
disasters in the minds of fishermen that
it is little wonder it is believed to have
power to raise the waters of the sea.
Woman, though bringing good luck

There was Polly Twitchell, who lived
in Casco Bay in the seventeenth cen
tury. She was said to raise storms,
wreck ships, and put to' sea in severe
gales. Goody Cole, in Whittler's
"Wreck of Rivermouth," prophesies dis
aster. The skipper says:
"I'm scary alwars to see her shake
Her wicked head."
The ballad recounts that she was
jeered at by the pleasure party, and in
revenge predicted the loss of the boat
which occurred soon after.

Branches.
Washington, Dec. O.-The Hawaiian
effair came ap in the senate in the shape
of a resolution asking the president to
submit to congress instructions regarding
Hawaii. The resolution went over. Mr.
Dolph then addressed the senate on the
Hawaiian affair. He said that hi was
opposed to the restoration of a. corrupt
and licentious queen, and favored annex
ation. He denounced Mr. Blount's re
port as one-sided and colored.
The vice president laid before the sen
ate a communication from Gov. Alt
geld of Illinois, advising the senate that
the State of Illinois, in view of the in
vitation extended to the states by con
gress, had caused to be made and placed
in Statuary hall of th* national capitol
a bronase statue of Gen. James Shields,
one of Illinois' mofet distinguished war
riors and statesmen. Mr. Cullom gave
notice that he would introduce an appro
priate resolution in reference to the statue
for the consideration of the senate.
Among the petitions presented was one
by Mr. Dolph, of the Oregon Horticultur
al society, favoring the maintenance of
the present duties on prunes. The senate
passed, with slight amendments, the
house joint resolution appropriating $50,
000 for employment of additional deputy
collectors of internal revenue to aid in
the execution of the Chinese exclusion
acts.
The first bill called up at this session
in the house was one for the establish
ment of a light and fog signal station at
Butter Flats, New Bedford, Mass. Gov.
Ssyres, the new watchdog of the treas
ury, keen and alert, insisted that the bill
sbculd be considered in committee of the
vhole, and Mr. Andrews, who has charge
of the measure, was forced to yield to his
demand. Mr. Blanchard of Louisiana
had the honor of being the first member
called to preside over the house in com
mittee. Mr. Anderson made a statement
covering the urgetcy of the appropria
tion, to which Gov. Sayres replied that
the station was not recommended by the
light houae board, and until it was so
recommended, he should fight It. Ac
coidingly Mr. Anderson withdrew it. The
joint resolution for the relief of bona
fide settlers on the Mille Lacs reserva
tion passed.
Col. Kiefer is preparing a resolution
calling on the attorney general for in
formation as to what has been done in
the direction of the anti-trust laws.
Washington, Dec. 7.—In the senate
tvheu Senator Hoar's Hawaiian resolu
tion was taken up, Senator Hill created
a sensation by making, perhaps, the
strongest speech of his senatorial careor.
He challenged the right of the president
to use military force to restore the Hawa
iian qieen. "There are three co-ordinate
branches of this government," he said,
"and this is an authority which is not
vested in the president alone." The con
templated action of the president, he de
clared, would be a usurpation of the
rights of congress. He was attentively
listened to throughout, and the galleries
rapidly filled up as the report of the sen
sational character of his speech spread
through the capitol. When Senator Hill
finished he was followed by Senator
Sherman, who also challenged the cor
rectness of the president's position. Mr.
Hoar's resolution was adopted.
Nothing of importance was done in the
bouse.

AWARD.
Royal Haklner Powder Has All the
.Honors, in Strength and Valne,
20 Per Cent Above Ita Nearest Com*
jietltor.
The Royal Baking Powder has the
enviable record of having received the
highest award for articles of its class,
Greatest strength, purest ingredients,
most perfectly combined, wherever ex
hibited in competition with others. In
the exhibition of former years -at the
Centennial, at Paris, Vienna and at
various state and industrial fairs,
where It has been exhibited, judges
have invariably awarded the Royal
Baking Powder the highest honors. At
the recent World's Fair the examina
tions for the* baking powder awards
were made by the experts of the chem
ical division of the agricultural depart
ment at Washington. The official re
port of the tests of the baking powders
which were made by this department
for the special purpose of ascertaining
which was the best, and which has
been made public, stows the leavening
strength of the Royal to be 100 cubic
inches of carbonic gas per ounce of
po\Vder. Of the cream of tartar baking
powders exhibited the next highest In
strength thus tested contained but 133
cubic inches of leavening gas. The
other powders gave an average of 111.
The Royal, therefore, was found of 20
per cent greater leavening strength
than its nearest competitor and 44 per
cent above the average of all other
tests. Its superiority in other respecta,
however, in the quality of the food it
makes as to fineness, delicacy and
wholesomeness could not be measured
by figures. It is these high qualities,
known and appreciated by the women
of the country for so many years, that
have caused the sales of the 7 Royal
Baking Powder, as shown by statistics,
to exceed the sale of all other balling
powders combined.

WASTE ON OCEAN LINERS.
Table Ware, Cutlery and Line*
Thrown Overboard by Piabeneet
Employe*.
A man who came oyer on a rec«nt
trip of the big Cunarder Campania,
being of an inquiring turn of mind,,
used his eyes and ears to good ad
vantage all the way, and he expressed
to a reporter the most unqualified
amazement at the constant wholesale
waste of valuable material. "I don't
think so much of the stewards selling
saloon fare to the steerage," he said to
a writer for the St. Louis Post-Dis
patch, "because the food would be
thrown overboard anyway, aud the
stewards, or 'flunkies,' as the seamen
call them, may as well make something
of it if they can. The4r pay is" small,
so the transaction results in substan
tial benefit to them. A great mauy
persons come over in the steerage be
cause they don't care what their accom
modations are so long as they get good
food, and they are pretty sure of being
able to buy that from the stewards.
Of course, it isn't the square thing to
do, but what I wondered the most si
was the utter disregard for the ship's
outfit.
"For instance, a steward would take
down to the steerage a dozen dishes and
plates of choice food in a large backet,
carefully covered, so the contents would
not be seen. Of course the bucket
contained silver forks, spoons, knives
and very often silver vegetable and
dessert dishes and individual chocolate
and coffee pots. When the food was
eaten the china and silver went back
to the bucket and the whole business
was quietly dropped into the refuse
chute and down into the sea. I've seen
as many as ten buckets taken down
by the same number of stewards three
or four times a day throughout a trip
and in every case the crockery, silver
ware and bucket went overboard. You
may take my word for it that anything
a steward carries below never gets
back to its proper quarters again—not
only because of the risk of detection,
but because of the trouble. I doubt,
though, if the risk is very great, for
some of the officers are themselves ex
ceedingly careless and destructive. I've
seen large, brand new, handsome blank*
ets taken into an officer's room for
him to use as a rug while taking a
bath. When he finished the blankets
were rolled up and quietly dropped
do\vn the chute, and that happened a
number of times during the voyage,
too. No, I can't suggest a remedy,
and the company wouldn't extefld me
a vote of thanks if I could, but it seems
to me it would pay to have those things
looked into a little and a responsible
man placed iu direct charge of affairs.
A steward's pay is very small, ranging
from $5 to $30 a mouth, but never ex
ceeding the latter sum. In many cases
they get no pay at all, but instead, not
only work without a stipend, but also
pay the company for the priviW of
serving it". 7
