The Disrvuto With Ecuador
A convention has been finally con
cluded for the settlement by arbitra
tion of the prolonged dispute with Ec
uador growing out of the proceedings
against Emilio Santos a naturalized
atizin of the United States
Relations With France
Our relations with the republic of
France continue to be such as should
exist between nations so long bound
together by friendly sympathy and
similarity in their form of gevernment
The recent cruel assassinaton of the
President of this sister republic called
forth such universal expressions of sor
row and condolence from our people
and government as to leave no diubt
of the depth and sincerity or our at
tachment The resolutions passed by
the Senate and Honre of Representa
tives on the occasion have been com
municated to the widow of President
CarnotRelntlons
Relations With Germany
Acting upon the reported discovery
of Texas fever in cargtfes of American
cattle the German prohibition against
importations of live stock and fresh
meats from this country has been re
vived It is hoped that Germany will
soon become convinced that the inhibi
tion is as needless as it is harmful to
mutual interests The German gov
ernment has excepted against that pro
vision of the customs tariff act which
Imposes a discriminating duty of one
tenth of a cent a pound on sugars
coming from countries paying an ex
port bounty thereon claiming that the
exaction of such duty is in contraven
tion of Articles Ii and 9 of the treaty of
1826 with Prussia In the interest of
the commerce of both countries and to
avoid even the accusation of treaty
violation I recommend the repeal of
so much of the statute as imposes that
duty and I invite attention to the ac
companying report of the secretary of
state containing a discussion of the
questions raised by the German pro
tests The llehring Sea Agreement
Early in the present year an agree
ment was reached with Great Britain
concerning Instructions to be given to
naval commanders of the two govern
ments in Bering sea and thecontIgu
North Pacific ocean for their
guidance in the execution of the
award 01 the Paris tribunal of arbitra
tion and the enforcement of the regu
lations therein prescribed for the pro
tection of sfeal life in the waters men
tioned An understanding has blen
reached for the payment by the United
States of 425000 in full satisfaction of
all claims which may be made by Great
Britain for damages growing out of the
controversy as to fur seals in Behring I
sea or the seizure of British vessels
engaged in taking seals in these wa
ters The award and findings of the
Paris tribunal to a great extent deter
mined the facts and principles upon
which these claims should be adjusted
and they have been subjected by both
governments to a thorough examina
tion upon the principles as well as the
facts which they involve I am con
vinced that a settlement upon the
terms mentioned would be an equitable
and advantageous one and I recom
mend that provision be made for the
prompt payment of the stated sum
Thus far only France and Portugal
have signified their willingness to ad
here to the regulations established un
der the award of the Paris tribunal of
arbitration
The AlnKkan Boundary
Preliminary surveys of the Alaskan
boundary and a preparatory examina
tion of the question of protection of
food fish in the contiguous waters of
the United States and the Dominion of
Canada are in progress
Great Ilritain juid VciieriieJa
The boundary of British Guinea still
remains in dispute between Great Brit
ain and Venezuela Believing that Its
early settlement on some just basis
alike honorable to both parties Is in
the line of our established policy to re
move from this hemisphere all causes
of difference with powers beyond the
sea I shall renew the eft 0ts hereto
fore made to bring about a restoration
of diplomatic relations between the dis
putants and to induce arbitration a
resort which Great Britain so conspic
uously favors in principle and respects
in practice and which is earnestly
sought by her weaker adversary
Recognition of Hawaii
Since communicating the voluminous
correspondence in regard to Hawaii
and the action taken by the Senate and
House of Representatives on certain
I questions submitted to the judgment
and wider discretion of Concro the I
organization of a government in place
of the provincial arrangement which
I followed the deposition of the Queen
has been announced with evidence of
its effective operation The recognition
usual in such cases has been accorded
the new government
Extradition Treaties With Ifztlj
Under the present treaties of extra
1 dition with Italy miscarriages of jus
I tice have occurred owing to the re
fusal of that government to surrender
its own subjects Thus far our efforts
to negotiate an amended convention ob
viating this difficulty have been un
availing t
Japan Seeks Complete Domestic
Autonomy
Apart from the war in which thlr
I land and empire Is engaged Japan at
tracts increasing attention in this coun
try by her evident desire cultivate
1 more liberal intercourse with us and to
seek our kindly aid in furtherance of
her laudable desire for complete au
tonomy in her domestic affairs and full
equality In the family of nations The
Japanese empire of today is no longer
the Japan of the past and our rela
tions with this progressive nation
should not be less broad and liberal
than those with other powers
