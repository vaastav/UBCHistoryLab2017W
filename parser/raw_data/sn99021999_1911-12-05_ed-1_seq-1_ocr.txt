Member of "Old Guard" Will Con

DECISION HASTENS RETIREMENT
Younger Men to Take Over Work
of Rearranging Affairs.
MANAGEMENT LITTLE ALTERED
Mr. Rockefeller for Nearly , T
Years Haa Been Only Nominally.
Assorlated with Standard
Oil In Dnslneas.
NEW YORK, Dee. 4. John D. Ilocke
ftller terminated his career as head of
the Standard Oil company today. With
him there also retired most of the con
spicuous figures of the early days of
the "oil truet." Not a Rockefeller re
mains among the officers and directors
of the Standard Oil company of New
Jersey, chief of the oil corporations,
which was the holding company up to
the time of the recent dissolution of the
great combine.
William Rockefeller, William G. Rock
efeller, O. W. Pratt. H. M. Flagler. E.
T. Bedford and others whose names have
been prominent In the oil business,
stepped behind the scenes today.
John D. Archbold, one of the few mem
tiers of the "old guard" to remain, be
carr. president of the Standard Oil com
pany of New Jersey and will control lu
destinies,
John I. Rockefeller was not present at
iS Broadway, the headquartera of the
Standard Oil company at the special
meeting at which time his resignation
was acted upon. The termination of the
business career of the man who has ac
quired a unique position in history and
amassed what Is generally regarded as
the largest private fortune In the world,
Vas a perfunctory proceeding. It had
been planned In advance, although the
plans had been kept secret. All the In
formation vouchafed at 84 Broadway
came In the shape of a brief typewritten
statement announcing the changes.
Management Little Changed.
Today's action affects not only the
New Jersey company, but a number of
other corporations In the Standard Oil
group. Although the list of officers and
directors Is virtually made over, the ex
ecutlve management will be changed but
little. To what extent today's action Is
an outcome of the C!solutlon of Stand
ard Oil was not disclosed from any au
thoritative1 source. It is generally un
. derstood the decision of h United States
supreme court merely hastened the retire
ment of inn whose advancing' yesrs
made It certain they could not retain
their places much longer.. It Is regarded
as probable that Mr. Rockefeller and
liis associates thought younger men
should take over the work of rearrang
ing the affairs of Standard Oil under the
Hew scheme of things.
Mr.- Rockefeller for nearly ten years
lias been only nominally associated with
Standaru Oil. He has visiter Broad
way only about once a year and his stays
usually were limited to a few minutes.
After the death of H. II. Rogers, Mr.
Kockefoller's visits became more fre
quent for a time, until gradually rsponsl
bllity wsjfsh1fted to Mr. Archbold. The
succession of Mr. Archbold to tho presi
dency had been expected.'
John A. Moffett, who was elected first
vtoe president of the reorganised New
Jersey company, is one of the best known
of the comparatively new men In the
fkandard Oil company. He was presi
dent of the Standard Oil company of In
diana when Judge Landls imposed his
SJD.000,000 fine upon that company.
Teaa-le Former Independent.
W. C. Teagle, elected second vice
president,' Is a man under forty, but he
long ago acquired a reputation for marked
abmty in the oil trade. He was an in
dependent refiner In upper New York
state when he sold out to Standard Oil,
and took a position as head of its expert
department, which is said to have de
veloped enormously under tits nianage-

Chauffeur is Held
in Connection With
Kaufman Murder
CHICAGO. Dec. 4-Detectlves in every
part of Chicago continued today to run
down every posslblo clue with the hope
of arresting the three men who are be
lleved to have murdered Mrs. IMmund
Kaufman near her home on Koscoe boule
vard SaturOay night after trying to hold
up tho woman and her husband.
Only one man, William Guttenbcrger. a
former chauffeur employed by Kaufman,
is being held by the police. Five other
arrests were made, hut all the suspects
wero let go when Kaufman failed to
Identify any of them. He did Identify
Quttenberger, but the latter stoutly pro
tests his Innocence and the police think
possibly that Kaufman made a mlsUUe
In the Identification.
After the police had refused early today
to allow Uuttenberger's father and
brother and Attorney George Remus lo
talk with the prisoner, the lawyer snld
he would file suit later In the day for
JC0.009 ugainst Assistant Chief of Pollen
Schuettler, Acting Captain Joel 8mitli
and 8erscarit John Benson, and In addi
tion would ask for a writ of habeas cor
pus for his client.
Columbus, 0., Bank
Suspends Business
COLUMBUS. O., Dec. 4.-The Union
National bank today posted a notice of
suspension by a resolution of tho board
of directors. It was further stated that
the bank Is now in the hands of the
comptroller of the currency.
As the action of the directors had been
expected It Is not thought the closing of
the bank will have any effect on the local
financial situation.
The capital stock of the bank was
$750,000, Its 'surplus $100,000 and It Is esti
mated that Its deposits approximated $-.-
ooo.oco.
WASHINGTON, Dec. 4.-The failure of
the Colurflbus Union National bank In
volved a possible loss of about $f-'00,000,
according to reports to the comptroller
of the currency. Assets to that extent
covering the institution's capital, surplus
and Undivided profits appeared to be of
questionable value.
No Restrictions on
Selling of Catttle
WASHINGTON, Dec. 4.-Cattle raising
and selling afe to have no additional re
striction as a result of the deliberations
of the supremo court of the United
States. That tribunal today decided false
representations placed In the malls as
to the character and quality of certain
cattle proposed for sale and Inducements
to correspondents to purchase . Inferior
cattle did not constitute a .violation of
the statute -against devising schemes for
obtaining money under false, pretenses.
TThe cohrir held tire "statute NrtP"d only
to lotteries.
The point arose In th,e case of George
F. Stever, 'J. B. Stever and Harry I.
Ball, who were charged with devising a
scheme at Fairfield, la., .for the sale of
cattle. H. O. Fowler Bros, of Colesburg,
Ky., figured as prospective purchasers.
GIRLS LOST IN BLIZZARD
RETURN TO SCHOOL HOUSE
PIERRE. S. D.'Dec. 4. (Spccial.)-Two
little girls by the name of Cheater, living
In the country near Hayes, showed Judg
ment a few nights ago which would have
down credit to older people. They left
school o go home in a storm, and miss
ing the trail which led to their home,
and realizing that they were not on the
right road for home, turned their horse
and followed their own track back to the
school house. Then not taking any more
chances In the dark they made themselves
and their horse as comfortable as pos
sible and "camped "down" for the night.
Their father In searching for them was
tost for some time, but finally reached
a fence, which he followed unt.ll It took
him home In the darkness, where fie waa
obliged to wait the coming of daylight to
continue his search, which located the
children safe at the school building.
NEW POINT RAISED IN REGARD
TO STATE INDEMNITY LANDS
PIERRE. 8. D., Dec. S.-Holdlng that
the lands which are claimed by the In
dians, whether allotted or not, are ex
empt from state selections and declaring
that there will be a shnrtago on the Plnr
Ridge reservation to fill the claims of
the Indians, who he says, are first, Al
lotting Agent Bates has raised a new point
against the" state selection of Indemnity
lands on that reservation. State Land
Commissioner Brinker has gone to Wash-
ngtou to secure a ruling 011 the disputed
olnt.
If tho department holds with the allot
.lug ugent, tho state will be forced to go
outside the reservation to Indemnify iueif
ior two sections, which wero taken by

I.OS ANC.lir.Ki5, Dec. 4.-l.atrl-t At
torney John D. Fredericks today In
foimed flie Associated Press tiiat Bert
It. Franklin, a detective employed by
the McN'amara defense' and now under
arrest on a charge of attempting to bribe
George N. Ickwood, a venireman, with
4,000, actually paid to Robert F, Bain,
the first sworn Juror In the case, 400 and
promised $3,000 more at the end of the
trial If he would vote for acquittal or
secure a disagreement of the jury..
Tho district attorney produced a sworn
copy of testimony by Mrs. Robert - F.
Bain, wife of the Juror, In his office last
Friday. Mrs. Bain not only told of the
first meeting, but related In detail how
Franklin came to her house October . a
few days before her husbund was sum
moned to serve on the Jury.
The district attorney declared that only
one more case of bribery so fur as he
knew, had yet been uncovered and that
the amounts In it had been similar to
the Lockwood and Bain cases, so that
In all about $12,000 was promised by the
defense to Influence Jurymen.
lie declared that examination of wit
nesses In the Franklin cae would reveal
the details of the alleged briberies In
which Frcnklln participated. He de
clared that at present no more arrests
weYe Intended, but that court revelations
might make it necessary to apprehend
persons upon whose orders Franklin Is
supposed to have acted.
Mrs. Bain's statement was made a few
hours before the Jury was discharged
and the Bains met they were both In
tears. At their little home here the
aged couple are downcast by the devel
opments, but the district attorney, It is
said, promised that they would not be
arrested or Involved beyond the giving
of testimony In the court proceedings.
The prosecution's Inforinatfon concern
ing the. bribery of still another sworn
Juror, according to District Attorney
Fredericks, . Is as well established as lrt
the Bain 'case. ." "
"The defense simply couldn't .win by
fair means." said Mr. Fredericks, "and
when Xhey tried to win by unfair tactics
V blocked them at every turn. That
was why they surrendered."
Bain, who Is a ruddy-faced, white
haired civil war veteran, was the first
juror sworn to try James B. McN'amara.
Tho bailiffs say he has manifested Irri
tation from time to time. Once when
the Jury was being taken to luncheon,
Bain attacked with a broom a news
paper photographer who attempted to
take his picture. Mrs. Bain la a little
woman many years the Junior of her
husbsnd, but gray-hatred.
Franklin Case Continued.
A preliminary examination of Franklin
for the alleged attempt to bribe George
N. Lockwood, a venireman, by the uso
of $4,000 was'scheduled to take place to
day, but a continuance for a week at
granted.
The two Incidents of alleged bribery
that of Bain and Lockwood are believed
not-to Include all the attempts to affect
the yerdlct of the Jury which has come
to the attention of the prosecution, and
District Attorney Fredericks Is glverJ as
authority for the statement that still an
other sworn Juror hed been tsmpered with.
The McNamaias sre to bo sentenced to
morrow, but the work of the prosecution
here to apprehend other persons Involved
will go on as a corollary to the In
vestigation of the federal government
which is believed to extend over a much
wider field.
More arrests and possibly more Indict
ments when the grand Jury is empanelled
are- looked for here as a result of the
confessions of the McNamara brothers.
Mars Labor Lenders Knew.
Organized labor was represented at con
ferences of counsel at which It was de
cided to enter pleas of guilty for the
McNamoras. This much was admitted
today by Clarence 8. Darrow, chief coun
sel for the prisoners.
"I sent telegrams to labor leaders to
come here for a conference," he said, "but
I did not and could not tell them what
It) was about. I thought they would un
derstand. I sent one telegram to Sam
uel Gom pere-Ts king for a representative
to advise with me. Kdward Nockels, sec
retary of the Chicago Federation of
Labor, camo and wis here two weeks
previous to the time the McNamarjie
mads their confession."
Nockels also was here shortly after the
trial began and talked with the Mc
Xamaras at the county Jail. Ha departed
soon, hoWKver, and did not return until
a fortnight ago. He dettted repeatedly
that his second visit I. ad anything to
do with the case.
Attorney Darrow declared today that
Nockeli knew the situation and accepted
the solulou reached as the most prac
ticable one.
A sensation was caused today when
scores of former talesmen In the Mc
Namara rSKe f!lel Into Judge Walter
Bordwell's co-.irt In response to sum

men were excused only for the Mc

(From a Staff Correspondent.)
WASHINGTON, Dec. 4-8pecIal Tele
gram.) Lens enthusiasm marked the
opening of the first regular session of
thp second congress than characterised
any of Its predecessors In the last five
years. There was lees handshaking, Uss
of spontanlty between opposing forces
than has ben apparent in the memory ot
newspaper men who have been covering
congress for years.
Tho crowds, wars- present In both houses
and ths usual receptions were held With

man who conceived the Idea that- a
momentous congress on the eve of a

properly upon screens throughout the
country for the edlllcatlm and possibly
the delight of the millions who look upon
this great republic as theirs by birth
right or by natuiailxation.
ISxpect Long Session.
Everywhere there seemed to be tho
shadow of protentlous happenings and
everybody seemed to feel as If Ihey were
entering upon a long and possibly dreary

from New York, and Stanley fiom Ken
tucky, over the manner In which the steei
investigation was be,ng conducted polntid
to other disagreements Hnd without say
ing so, thought the csuse of democracy
will be full of pitfalls.
On the other side Mann of Illinois, the
minority leader, looks upon the session
now on with trepidation, and ponslbly
with mixglvlngs. Both sides are on guard
to take advantage of any advan
tage, and politics may be expected to he
played with the presidency as the goal
from thin time on until the gavel falls
some time next summer when the nation's
legislators will repair to their homes to
enter upon tho work ot re-electing them
selves. A'ebraskans All There.

GOMPERS ANSWERS DARROW
Says He Did Not Send Nockels to
Los Ang-eles.
NO REPORTS MADE TO HIM
If Attorney Told ( hleaao .Man Me.
Namaras Were About to Con
fess letter Sent Mo Word
to Him,
NEW YORK. Dec. 4.-Presldent Gom
pers of tho American Federation of
Labor explained his part In the confer
ence of labor lenders which Attorney
Darrow said was held at Los Angolos
before the McNamara defense bedded to
enter pleas of guilty.
"I was at Atlanta attending' the con
vention of the American Federation of
Labor," said Mr Gompers, "when Mr.
Darrow's telegram reached me. It merely
akti4, that some representative come, to
Ls Angeles furai;ooferonce. J I wasax
ceedlnaly . busy, atd -after glancing
through ths message handed it to some
one elan.
"It was not until two days later that
1 learned that Nockels had gone to Los
Angeles, or that anyone hud gone. Nock
els never reported to tne st ah. If Dar
row told Nockels that the McNamsras
were about to confess, Nockels never
told me.
"When specific charges are brourht
against the union," asserted Mr. Gompers,
it will be the duty of the American Fed
eration of Labor to Investigate. There
has been a lot of vaporizing about these
suaplcloris, but there has been nothing
definite.
"In the Los Angeles case you see what
labor does when It finds proof of guilt.
Until proof comes I Ignore all the ac
cusations as the whisperings of malicious
enemies of labor "
Drew Sais Komnvrs Sincere.
"I have no Information which would
lead me to believe that Samuel Gompers
was not sincere in his ill and In the Me
Namara case," said Walter Drew, coun
sei and chief executive officer of the
National Erectors' association today. "1
do not say that Gompers Is guilty of any
crime or haa guilty knowledge of any
crime. I do not even know that ha will
be subpoenaed to appear before the fed
eral grand Jury of Indianapolis."
Mr. Drew added that In his opinion ths
federal authorities at Indianapolis had
their evidenoe In such shape that an In
dictment would be returned when the
grand Jury reconvened on December 14.
He expressed the opinion tnat between
twenty and thirty men would be Indicted.
Just who these men were he did not care
to say.
"it Is known and on record that the ex
ecutive board of the International Asso
ciation of Bridge and Structural Iron
Workers voted $1,000 a month to finance
the operations of tho Mc-N'ainaras," he
said.
After the Investigation 1s under way
at Indianapolis, Mr. Drew said, others
would be begun at Ios Angeles, Cleve
land, Boston and Chicago I
