fitand.
Tni ! proof of the pudding is in the
oaiing. When a paper which claims to
too a great circulating medium hns to
solicit patronage by circular nnd fills
its wants columns , which are supposed
to yield a largo part of its revenue , with
free advertising , for people who are
obliged to advertise , it is proof positive
that the concern hns no bottom or else

Tun farmers of South Dakota seem to
"ho very much in earnest in their efforts

lobby is worldii ? ngainst them it will
take a largo number of petitions toovor-
coruo that influence. The attack

of thin number 2)5-ll.j ( ) ! were on farms.
There were 1-54,093 who owned their
farms and 00,787 who rented. The fact
that nearly half of the farmers had no

TO nKPKAL Till ! SlM'Ktl ACT.
Senator Hill of Now York hna Intro
duced In the United States sonata n bill
to roponl tlio silver net under which the
government IB required to purchase
1,600,000 ounces of silver monthly. This
nrcortls with domoorntlo policy ns defined -
fined In the national platform of the
parly. It is also In conformity with the
view of Senator Sherman , who has sn'.d
several times thnt the net ought to bo
repealed because It Is nn embarrass
ment to the Kovornmont nnd has failed
to accomplish whiit wns expected of It
in.relation to the prlco of stiver , and
very lllcoly of other republicans. Ills
therefore to bo expected that Senator
Hill will have the support and assist-
nnco of the Ohio senator in his olTort to
secure the repeal of the silver purchase
net , nnd It Is qvilto possible that the bill
for this purpose will pass the senate.
In the house , however , It Is HUoly to
ho chnrp'iy ntita oniz.od. A democratic
member of the house wns quoted recently -
"tho Sherman silver
cently us ssiylnc ; thnt
ver law cannot bo repealed" unless the
eastern democrats tire willing to glvo us
free cotnngo and allow our state banks
to Issue circulating notes. The dem
ocrats of the south nnd west are
bound to have moro money of eomo
kind. " This undoubtedly rollocts the
Bcntitnnnt of the fiouthcrn and west
ern democratic representatives with
very few exceptions , and It foreshadows
an interesting contest , over the money
question within the democratic party.
The admission must bo made that the
existing silver not , under which the
product of Iho American mines Is pur
chased by the government , has not kept
up the .price of silver. Its Immediate
ollect wns to advance the market value
of ihe wlnto metal , but this was speedily
lost and the prlco wont steadily down
ward. Over 5-1,000,000 ouiu'es wore pur-
chnsoa during the last fiscal year at tin
average price of 91 cents per oum'o , the
highest price reached in the year boinjr
$1.021 and the lowest 83 cents. While ,
however , the law has not boon success
ful , as it was expected to bo in main
taining the orlco of silver , it has boon
the moans of adding over $110,000,000 to
the currency since its passage , and un
less there is some legislation proposed
which will continue at least this ralo of
currency Increase the southern and
western democrats generally will op
pose the repeal of the Sherman act.
Eastern democrats will not support a
measure for the free and unlimited coin
age of silver. They are fully committed
against that policy by their course at
the first session of this congress , nnd
there is not the slightest reason to ex
pect n change. They will bo found
equally persistent , it is not to bo
doubted , in hostility to any proposition
'or ' allowing stale banlcs to issue cur-
cney. The promise , therefore , seems
to be good for an interesting conflict ,
with the conditions somewhat unfavor-
iblo to the repeal of the silver purchase
net by this concrress.
GREAT CANAL PROJECTS.
Tharo are now no loss than three
lant canal projects , involving the ex
penditure of many millions of dollars ,
which are soon to bo brought up for the
consideration of congro&s. One is the
Nicaragua canal and the other ; ! are two
different projects for connecting the
great lakes and the Atlantic ocean by
waterways of sufllcient size to accommo
date largo vessels. An effort will bo
made to secure 3100,000,000 for the
prosecution of the work on the Nicar
agua canal. President Harrison is in
favor of government aid of this project ,
and the convention that nominated him
also declared in its favor. It is pro
posed that the bonds of the company
blmll bo guaranteed and that the gov
ernment shall control the canal. In his
message to congress the president says
that "It is impossible to overstate the
viuuo from every standpoint of this
great enterprise , " and this view is taken
by many members of congress as well as
by an inlluonllnl portion of the public
press.
President Harrison's message also
warmly commends the plan of construct-
iug an American ship canal around the
falls of Niagara and the opening of ship
communication bolwoon the great lakes
and one of the seaport towns. "Wo
should not hesitate , " ho says , "to avail
ourselves of our great natural'trade
advantages. Wo should withdraw the
support which is given to the railroads
and steamship lines of Canada by a
trnfllR that properly belongs to us , and
no longer furnish the earnings which
lighten the otherwise crushing weight
of the enormous public subsidies that
have boon given to them. " The presi
dent only touches upon this subject
brlelly In the course of his discussion of
our relations with Canada and treats it
rather as an international matter than
as one of strictly commercial importance
to this country. The Itittor aspect of
the question should not bo overlooked.
As the president himself says in another
portion of hla message , the coast
wise trido on the great lakes
amounted in 1800 to 23,205,050 tons.
The total vessel tonnage passing
through the Detroit river that year was
21,081,000 tons , or nearly as great a ton-
nutro as entered and cleared from the
ports of London and Liverpool combined
during the same year , nnd it is to bu
borne In mind that the season for the
Detroit river was only 228 days. The
estimated freight tonnage for the De
troit river for the present year Is 25,000-
003 tons , against a little moro than 23- ,
000,000 tons In 1891. Those figures givu
Bouio idea of the enormous freight tradio
of the great lakes and its rapid growth ,
nnd show that there in ample foundation
for the increasing sentiment in favor ol
a moro adequate outlet to the sea than
is now afforded. It has boon Intimated
that n soon us the oiuml which Canada
it ) now building at the See is finished ,
which will glvo that country a wntor-
way ot not loss than fourteen foot in
depth at any point from Lsko Superior
to the sea , the Wolhind and all othoi
Canadian canals will bo closed , to Amcrl
can shipping , and American commorct
going by the St. Lawraueo routu musl
bo carried in Canadian bottoms , Till :
throat may uovor ha carried out , but i
is uudoniablo that in the emergency o
war between this country nnd Great
Uritain the lakes would bo absolutely
controlled by the latter under the proa
out conditions. It la said t hat the Brit
Ish nnv.v has moro than 150 warships
whoso draught would admit , them Into
the lakes through the Canadian canals.
Hut It U the commercial side of this
question that most strongly appeals to
the average citizen. In the wosl It
touches Interests that nro vital nnd In
the cast it Is constantly attracting
greater attention. Senator Hill nnd
Congrossinm Tracy of Now York are
making active preparations to got n bill
throuch congress providing for the 1m-
mediate construction of n ship canal
through that stuto. The proposed route
Is up the Hudson river to the Krlo canal
nnd thence along the line of the latter
to BiilTnlo. The bill will provide for a
waterway 200 foot wide , with an average
depth of twenty feet. Tha cost of this
great enterprise is estimated at SloO-
000,000. Such a canal would moot nil
the demands of commerce from the
hikes to the sea and would bo available
in the event of war. It would put nn
end to r.illroad extortion , which is now
somewhat feebly restrained during the
summer months by the iiiotTeolual old
Erie canal with Us little 200-ton boats ,
which can only carry half tholr capacity
of freight on account of Insulllclcnt
water.
The obstacle which the friends of the
project fathered by Senator Hill will
llrst meet will bo the question of its nrac-
Ucablllty. Among those in the north
west who are clamoring for n ship canal
are some who S'ty that the route across
the state of Now York would bo ti fail
ure on account of thonaturoof the coun
try , the gront distance , and the supply
of water at the summit level. They
favor going around the falls of Niagara
on the American side and thence into
the St. Lawrence. The Chamber of Com-
mcrco of Dulutli has called a deep water
convention to bo hold In Washington
after the holidays , when it is expected
that the whole subject will bo exhaust
ively discussed by inon who have made
a study of it.
01' ' IMMlOltATIOX.
Senator Chandler , chairman of the
sonata committee on immigration , has
introduced his promised bill for sus
pending Immigration one year , which it
Is understood Is concurred in by the
members of the committee. The text
of the pleasure is not at hand , but it is
presumed that it is so drawn as not to
interfere with visitors to ttio World's
fair , though it will occur to everybody
that there is danger of such a law prov
ing troublesome In this direction. Of
course the intention is to keep out the
immigrants who come with a view to
remaining , but will it not bo practica
ble for some such to get in on the state
ment that they are hero simply as vis
itors ? On the other baud will it bo
possible to avoid some nnnoyanco and
trouble in discriminating ? However ,
Senator Chandler and the committee of
which ho is chairman have thought this
matter out very carefully and undoubt
edly the bill is so framed as to avoid the
possible difficulties indicated.
The object of proposing to suspend
immigration for a year is understood to
bo to avert the danger of nn invasion of
cholera. There is unquestionably rea
son to fear that the plague will visit
this country next year unless the great
est possible precautions are taken to
keep it out. High medical authorities
in Europe are ot the opinion that the
disease will bo widely distributed in
Europe next summer , and if such should
bo the case it would bo impossible to
prnvont its coming to this country if
unrestricted immigration ivont on.
ITowovor rigid our quarantine regula
tions might he if wo allowed ordinary
immigrants not now prohibited by law
to come in wo should subject ourselves
to the danger of n cholera visitation
that might become epidemic. Prom
this point of view , therefore , the pro
posal to suspend general immigration
until the danger from the pluguo has
passed is justifiable. Self-preservation
is the first law and it would be a mis
take , perhaps a very crave one , not to
regard it in this matter.
But the motive for suspending immi
gration must bo clearly doiiuod , to the
end that the world may understand that
it is in no sense a concession to the de
mand of certain elements for the erec
tion of a Chinese wall against Europe
ans , however worthy , who desire to
como to the United States in order to
avail themselves of the privileges and
opportunities of American oiti/.onshlp.
Hostility to immigration has recently
boon assuming a more iiggresslvo * suirlt
and there Is reason to baliovothat it has
won favor with men who not very long
ago were In hearty accord with the un
broken policy of the country In this
matter. It will not bo well to allow this
Foiitimcnt to grow unchallenged , or wo
shull in u few years bo placed in a posi
tion whore wo muy begin to realize dc-
cndonco instead of experiencing pro
gress. This country cannot advuhco as
it should do and reject the industrious
and thrifty of ether lands. Lot ua pro
tect ourselves against cholera , or any
ether plague by every moans available ,
but no advantage must bo taken of a
possible danger to make a permanent
departure from a policy to which the
country owes its wonderful progress and
pi asperity.
Reports concerning the growing wheat
crop , while varying greatly in different
localities , are generally favorable and
the outlooU for next year , so far an It la
indicated , leads to the belief that n crop
exceeding tlmt of the present year will
bo harvested. This is looking a long
way ahead , but the men who uiako crop ;
a study always 'oogln to predict au soon
as the seed is In the ground.
It Is stated by the Cincinnati Prlci
Current that the visible supply of wlienl
has now got above 70,000,000 bushels
and will probably go still higher. The
tendency , however , toward the enlarge'
montof warehouse- stocks is thought tc
bo practically ut an end for thjs season ,
though it way bo sonic time before anj
considerable diminution ot those avail
able supplies will ba apparent. Thgrc
are now about 27,030,000 bushels
more of wheat in sight in this country
limn at this lime lust yea" , but the ovi-
donee points to the fact thnt the actual
aggregate supply in the United State :
ia about 75,000,000 bushels losi than il
was then. This is supposed to moai :
that while ttio regular warehouse stocKi
indicateuu increase of 27,000,001
bushels the smnllor warehouses nnd the
farmers Imvo fully 100,000,000 bushels
less than the amount of tholr holdings a ,
yoarnpo. The tremendous outpouring
of wheat during several weeks of the
fall has enabled the grain experts to
fix their estimates with some degree of
nccnrncy. They could hardly concolvo
whore It all came from , hut they are
now convinced that the farmers were
unloading about all they had , which Is
probably the true explanation.
XO DVl'l.KX COUNCIL.
The proposition to crealo a lower nnd
upper branch of the city council Is
slightly premature for n city of our
present population. Only cltlos of half
a million population can nlTord the lux
ury.
ury.What
What wo do need IB a inayornnd coun
cil with moro distinct powers. The
mayor should bo the responsible honii of
the city government. Ho should have
absolute power to appoint the heads of
departments for a fixed period and they
In turn should have the appointment of
their subordinates without Interference
by anybody except when charges of mis
demeanor or incompotoncy are sustained
against thorn. In ether words , the coun
cil should have no voice In the selection
of executive officers , being purely it leg
islative body. The council should , however -
over , have the right to Investigate and
try appointive city olllctnls for miscon
duct and when a majority of that body
finds such olUcers guilty nnd declares
tholr places vacant the mayor should bo
compelled to fill the vacancy.
The mayor should have oo-ordlnnto
power with the council in the making of
contracts , nnd in cnso ho refuses to ap
prove any contract which has received
the approval of the council the Jonly
remedy should Ho in the courts. In ether
words , In all ctuea whore contracts are
disapproved by the mayor the contrac
tors'recourse should bo an application
for mandamus. If the objections of the
mayor are found to bo frivolous or
against public policy the courts will order
him to sign th < contract. If , on the
other hand , his ' bjcctions are based on
legal grounds or In the Interest of
good government they will .sustain
him and the contract will bo declared
void. Under the present system a cor
rupt combination in the council or a
factional combination can override the
mayor's veto and destroy all the safe
guards which were intended to bo
thrown around the lawrnnhing power.
The duplex council would not obviate
the defects of the present ayslom. It
would not stop the disgraceful traffick
ing in p'aces by councilman or the dic
tation of unlit apnjintmonts by the
threat thnt all thOgood appointments
would bo rejected unless the bad ones
could bo saddled on the mayor.
The duplex council would not do
away with the dangerous influence
which contractors and 'frnnchiscd cor-
poratioiib exert on the council. It
would only multiply corruption.
The sate and practical reform would
bo to Increase the pay of the mayor and
councilmen so as to get first class busi
ness men of known integrity to devote
their whole tlmo to the city's business
nnd then t6 center the responsibility
for good government.- much as
possible upon the mayor by depriving
the council of the power to dictate or
trade patronage and by giving the
mayor's veto of contracts and jobs
greater weight than it now has. If con
tracts smuggled through Iho council
were liable to n chock by the mayor
thnt could only bo sot aside by the
courts , boodllng would becorao loss ro-
munoratlvo to the parties who are in
terested in public work contracts or
schemes for franchises.
A STRIKING CASK IX'OJ.V2' .
After more than twenty yours of hard-
fought , complicated litigation with the
Illinois Central railroad , Chicago has
nt last made good her claim to the
ownership of the lake front
The relations of Chicago to the
Illinois Central in the dispute over the
lake front are very much the same as
these of Omaha with the union depot
grounds. The Illinois Central has had
actual possession of the lake front for
nearly forty years , but the supreme
court of the United States has just is
sued Its decree that the occupancy of
this tract of land by the Illinois Central
did not convoy a title.
The disputed lake front was really an
accretion of earth made and improved
by the rn 11 road company at its own ex
pense , while the Omaha depot grounds
were bought outright by the city and
deeded to the company on condition
thivt it should forever maintain its pas-
Bongor nnd freight transfers at Omaha.
This part of the contract never has been
compiled with by the road. The so-
called union depot has uovor boon any
thing but a local station of the Union
Pacific. The moro fact that the road
has hld undisputed possession would ,
n the light of tlio recent tloclslon of the
supreme court , scarcely constitute a clear
title.

which this questjqn has thrown the
Magic City U nn u'nJcfHunnto ono for its
public schools , for ft loaves a doubt as
to whether it is the duly of the county
commissioner * or the city council to
levy taxes for school purposes , it being an
open question whether South Omaha is
n flrftt or second-class city. It appears
thnt the property owners have not boon
required to pay school taxes slnco 1887 ,
the rovoiluo from the saloons provlngsuf-
flciont for the purpose. Now that this
source Is no longer equal to the demand
the question of authority to levy n
school tax arises for the first time.

Ail Kxploiloil Theory.
CMcagn Tribune.
The bombardment of the skies
Texas , paid for by the people of the United
States through the medium of the national
treasury , has ended in failure. The mial test
lasted from sunset to sunrise , and the noise
of tlio explosion was heard at a distance of
thirty miles. Some clouds gathered over
head , but they yielded no rain , though a
trace of moisture was observed at a point in
the vicinity. Everybody who witnessed the
experiment , except General Oryenforth nnd
his backers , seems to have been convinced
that the effort failed to help the theory.
Those who are committed to it claim to the
contrary , and state it to bo the intention to
experiment in South Dakota next year. It is
fair to presume that this will bo done if a
fresh appropriation bo made , and not other
wise. The chances for such an appropriation
are not flattering. Possibly the country has
seen the last of these abortive attempts at
raiumakiug for the present.

The farmers of Nebraska arc deluging the

coming from other northwestern states
setting forth thnt they are farmers , grain

cached the lowest prlco over before known

son of the prevailing depression is on
iccount of a combine existing between

and asking that the committee having

nvoRtlgitto the methods of the combine , and
that further action on the WnBlihimi-Untcli

of this Investigation. The memorial Is now
jelng referred to the commiltco on ngrlcul *

the proposed investigation as \ \ iso ami Just.
An effort was made upon the floor ot the sen-

Can Not Discredit 1'orter's Work.
Now that the election Is over and no

discrediting tlio work of the superintendent
of the census , the investigation of his bureau
which was begun with so much flourish last
session , will bo abandoned. These members
of tha committee who attended the session
when Mr. Porter's work was investigated
are so fully satislled with the utter uselessness -
ness of further investigation that they have
threatened to resign from the census com
mittee unless they are permitted to drop the
matter. Foremost among these who now ac

Philadelphia Press : The threatened inJury -
Jury to American Interests by the French
control of the Panama railroad demonstrates
the great importance of removing all possible
doubt about the ownership and control of
the Nicaragua canal.
Philadelphia Ledger : All the gulf mid
Pacific coast states are anxious that the
government should not only aid in the con
struction of the now canal , but got such con
trol of it as will prevent discrimination or
combinations with the Pacific railroad. The
feeling on this subject on the Pacific slope is
very strong.
Philadelphia Times : If it will pay , pri
vate capital should build it. In no event
should the government of the United States
undertake tlio enterprise or pledge its credit
for either principal or interest of the neces
sary cost of the undertaking. The federal
government will need nil the nionoy It should
rnlso by taxation for the legitimate purpose
of maintaining Itself ,
Novy York Tribune : If the Monroe doc
trine li to bo reduced to n fnrco nt the Isth
mus , nnd Aniorlenn commercial Inlorpsta nro
to bo endangered by n foreign corporation , It
Is high tlmo thnt the Nicaragua cntml was
taken up as n government enterprise nml
carried out ns nn American work. Tlmt
would Itnoek out what llttlo brenth there In
left In the Panama canal project nml would
fatally linpnlr the value of the Columbian
government's rights to the Isthmus property
ns the residuary legatee.
Chicago Inter Ocean : The chief benefit !
from nil directions should accrue to the people
ple of this country. The canal means n sav
ing of $10,000,000 to $20,000,000 yen Ito our
people , us the rates are charged liv this or it
foreign country. That Is tlio thing to con
sider in debating the placement of control.
With this nrm of eimum-rco provided , the
products of thu Mississippi water shed cftu l

St. Paul Pioneer-Press : There ought to
bp n healthy public sentiment which would
make Impossible the public advocacy of any
such measure as that which has been boldly
proclaimed In n great city of the union , and
which Is iilKnit to carry the war into every
local community , for the great prlzo of $100-
000,000. It is strange Indeed that men can
bo found to father such a cause , ami strange
that they can retain their place and honor
in a community while devoting themselves
to Its advancement , For in this Nicaragua
matter ono cannot well deceive himself or
hldo behind n breastwork of plausible pro-
tenses.

New VOUK , Dee. 7. "Tlio cnso has all the
appearances of a barbarous murder , "said Con
sul General Uiva of Italy , while explaining
the letter ho wrote to Governor McICinlcy of
Ohio concerning the Italian who was killed
in Cleveland recently by a police ofileer. "As
I am Informed , n countryman of mine , F. A.
Coror.io , was clubbed and shot thrco times
by policemen on the morning of November XI.
If my Information bo correct , the unfortunate
man was merely protesting against arrest at
the time of the assault. The crime seems a
most atrocious one. Corozio , while plead
ing for mercy , is reported to have been
cruelly shot in the presence of his wife and
daughter.
"Tho Italians are naturally Indignant ever
the cruel nnd. brutal performance. They have
started a fund to prosecute the man who
killed Coro/io. My letter simply asks the
governor to give the true facts in the case.
I have been asked to resent the alleged mur
der of an Italian. I can take no action until
I am fully informed as to the facts In the
case. As soon as the governor gives mo tlio
official version of Coro/io's death. I shall de
termine what action I may take. "
