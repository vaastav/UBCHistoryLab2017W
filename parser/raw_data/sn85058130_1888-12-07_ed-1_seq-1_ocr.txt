BARRYS NEW ORDER
The Text of an Address Is
sued by Him
UNITED LABOR BROTHERHOOD
To be Organized on a Decent Realized
BasIsProgressive Educational
PolicyProhibition
J
CHICAGO December 6The limts
will tomorrow publish the text of an
address issued by Thomas B Barry
outlining the lines and purposes of the
new organization which he proposes
shall be known as the II Brotherhood of
United Labor In the address Barry
says he is not advocating the formation
of a new order for the purpose of fight i
ing the Knights of Labor or to gratify
his personal ambition but to establish
honesty In and place the labor move
ment on a decent realized basis which
will make it forever almost impossible
for cliques and rings to be formed to
destroy in months the labor of years
The organization it is stated will be
established
ON A DECE5T REALIZED BASIS
It will leave to trades or branches com
plete jurisdiction and control over
their own affairs disputes or contro
versies arise between members and
thair employers they will be settled
by those most conversant with the
trouble and not by those who know
nothing about the cause of complaint
The order will maintain friendly rela
tions with all limited organizations of
labor It Will says the address
draw the line closely on scabs and
scabism It will urge the study of co
operation and the means of bringing it
into practice and will insist on mem
bers giving fair manufacturers the
preference when purchasing the neces
saries of life it will pursue a
PROGRESSIVE EDUCATIONAL POLICY
to bring into practice andhave enacted
into laws its platform of principles
The cardinal principles of the brother
hood will be to obtain currency and
transportation reform j
Jirsjt tJha right of man to use of the
earth I
Second The taking from usurers
and Shylocks the right to control our
currency
ThirdGovernment ownership of the
means of transporting persons freight
and intelligence and the taking of those
engines of hnman happiness out of the
hands of stock gamblers and specula
tors and to operate them for the
BENEFIT OF THE PRODUCER AND CON
SUMER
While seeking a settlement of these
questions the order will labor for the
ameliorative terms such as the reduc
tion of the hours of labor to eight per
day prohibition of child labor the
abolition of convict contract labor the
abolition of the contract system on na
tional Slate and municipal works the
prohibition of foreign labor under con
tract and purification of politics
through the adoption of the Australian
system of voting etc All of the details
of the plan of the organization have
not yet been decided on but
it will ba more of a federation than
compactlike body like the Knights of
Labor In it there will be no money at
the disposal of the general or federal
officers for Barry claims the accumula
tion of large sums of money at one cen
tral point as in the old order is one of
the greatest dangers to labor organiza
tions

opposed to the laws of God In
a revelation to Joseph Smith He
states distinctly Thou shalt love
thy wife He does not say
wives The head ol our church today

To the Editor of THE HERALD
THE HERALD of today under the
caption of itA Big Mining Suit1 gave
an item associated with our litigation i
It has caused many inquiries from
my friends The court will decide the
suitThis
This is the whole story Some years
since some fellows stole our dog They
kept a rope around him until a few days
ago when they gave him up to us fear
ing he would bite them
This same gang under a new name
after letting him go grabbed at his tail
The dog is at home chained up safely
Being on his own ground he will take
care of his tail and we will take care of
the dog So far we nave only allowed
him to bark well we admit he has
made a snap or two but he may bite if
teased too long
Thanking my friends for their sym
pathy I assure them there is not the
slightest reason for anxiety
