NEWS SUMMARY.
BY TELEGRAPH.
Morning Report. Speculations from
Washington intimate that the President's
Messaga will not be delivered to Con
gress till to-day. The most interesting
and important portion of the Message, it
is said, relates to the question of slavery,
and the subject of restoration of the
rebel States to the Union. Tho thoru-g
frestdent. a theory, which we can readi
ly believe.. ....Notice has already been
given of the introduction of a bill into
Congress, creating the office of Lieut.
General, with a view of conferring that
rank on Gen. Grant, an honor which
every good Union man will concede he
has justly wou The siege of Knox
vilie was raised on the 4th, and Long
street is in full retreat, struggling to
make his escape into Virginia. Sher
man's advance reached Knoxvilie on
the morning of the 4th, and it was found
that the rebels had retreated during the
night. Gen. Shackelford's cavalry is in
close pursuit.and deserters and prisoners
are being brought in daily. This retreat
of Longstreet virtually decides the ques
tion of the permanent deliverance of East
Tennessee .Richmond papersof Sat
urday say Longstreet commencedhis re
treat immediately upon his defeat before
Knoxvilie on Sunday, a week. The rebel
papers admit the defeat of Longstreet
before Ksoxville, and say he is retreat
ing towards Abingdon, Virginia. Bush
rod Johnson had effected a junction
with Longstreet A portion of Long
street's army was trying to make its way
into worth Carolina Secretary
Chase adopts the recommendations of
the Commissioner of Internal Revenue,
v relative to whisky and tobacco, and a
still further increase will be made of the
tax on these articles. The income from
these articles fell short of $60,000,000
last year Major-General Freneh, it is
said has been relieved from his com
mand, preparatory to charges for miscon
duct in the late affair at Mine Run. A
more prompt movement of commands
will be required hereafter, when march
ing orders are received The Kentuc
ky Legislature met on Monday, and was
organized with Dr. Hawkins as Clerk of
the Senate, and J. B. Lyne Clark of the
House. The Governor's Message u

prisoners from Chattanooga passed
through Indianapolis on Monday, en
route for Rock Island, Illinois... ...A
Chattanooga dispatch of the 7th says,
Hardee is slowly falling back from Dal
tonj with Bragg' s whipped army, and
that the mountains are full of deserter.
This would indicate that Grant is not

General Grant's Campaign.
Although Gen. Grant's campaign can
not yet be said to have closed, it is pit
aDt to contemplato wliat ho has accom
plished, and the manner in which it was
done. It is plain to those ioast acquaint
ed with military matters thsit General
Grant's combinations and movements at
Chattanooga, as they did at Vicksburg:
rome fully ud to what the common peo
ple regard as Napoleonic. Their admi
ration of the man is not in the slightest
diminished, but on the contrary greatly 1
I. .- rain 2n-AlL- I
increased, in that he chose an entirely
different plan of operations from what
r, ,
ntae-teaths of the people would have Bug-
g neu naa tney oeen consuiieu iu J
premises.
When Gen. Grant assumed command
at Chattanooga, the Army of the Cum
berland was cooped up in that town, liv
ing, or rather almost starving, on quarter
rations, its communications endaugered,
its trnnsportation facilities not equal
to the task of furnishing the army
with supplies, while an arrogant enemy
were hemming it in with batteries plant-
ed upon almost inaccessible positions on
toe mountains. It was evident to every
body that something must be done
speedily for the relief of the Army,
or it would eventually be compell
ed to evacuate the town, for the
possession of which' the "battle of Chica
mauga was fought. Gen. Hooker had
reached Bridgeport when Gen. Grant ar
rived at Chattanooga, and Gen. Sher
man was on his way south of the Ten
nessee river. The Rebels, however, had
sent a large forca to operate against
Gen. Sherman Jay fortifying Tuscumbia,
and harrassing his advance to such an
extent that k was evident weeks
must elapse before ho could effect a
junction with Grant While Sherman
was on his way towards Chattanooga, the
common belief was that he designed
flanking the rebels in front of Chatta
nooga by moving on Dalton or Rome,
and thus threatening the rebel commu
nications. There was a feeling of dis-
appointment when it was ascertained
that Sherman avoided the rebels at Tub-
, . , i .t
cumbia, by crossing the river below the
town, and was making rapid marches
towards Chattanooga on the JNortttSide
of the Tennessee. Prior, however, to
Sherman's arrival, Hooker's brilliant
wagons, uerore his Dfcuiiartton of Look
out Valley, every pound of provisions
bad to be transported over miles of al
most impassable mountain roads, which
were continually getting worse, before it
reached the suffering garrison at Chat
tanooga. Hooker's success substituted
river for mule transportation, and ,'re
moved all doubts as to the ability of
Gen. Grant to hold Chattanooga.
In the meantime, rumors of the con
centration of rebel armies for the pur
pose of flanking Chattanooga, by match
ing on Burnside and driving him out of
iiust lennessee, began to fill the people
with apprehension. Why don't the Gov
ernment reinforce Burnside?; was the
anxious inquiry all over the country.
Why didn t.Gen. Grant send a portion of
his army to Burnside's assistance ? What
an he be thinking about? Bttell's cam
nnign over again! were the doleful ex
lumations that greeted us on every
hand. We confess we partook of the
general fear, and were as deeply mysti
Sed by the inscrutable indifference appa
rently manifested by Gen. Grant as to
Burnside's fate, a3 any of our readers
Some editors see the end from the bagiaJ
ning, and know it all, always we do
not claim to belong to that class.
The next news was that Sherman had
joined Grant, but Burnside was surround
ed by Longstreet. What's Sherman do
ing at Chattanooga? cried out au impa
tient people. Why is he .not marcbirig
to the relief of Burnside? and dark
hints of a deliberate intention to sacri
fice Burnside were floating about But
suddenly a ray of light began to disperse
the thick clouds of anxiety and gloom.
The- news flashed across the country that
Grant's columns were in motion, and
every one knew that meant fight. Wood
has stormed the rifle pits in front of bit
position. Hooker has stormed Lookout
Mor.ntn'n, nnd Palmar, rrunger; 5n"er-
man and Hooker have stormed Mission
Ridge 7,000 prisoners are captured, and
50 pieces of artillery Bragg's army ia
routed, and in full retreat, pursued by
our victorious columns were items of
news following each other in quick suc
cession, and then the whole thing was as
clear as the poon-day sun. Grant had
relieved Burnside by whipping Bragg,
and everybody rejoiced and wondered
why they,had not seen it before.
Thus, by a shrewd foresight, and thor
ough confidence in himself, Gen. Grant
has won the most brilliant campaign of
the war, even if he goes no farther.
Bat wc are inclined to think that he'does
not regard the campaign as closed so
long as Atlanta is in the hands of the
rebels. Longstreet is on a weary pil
grimage to Virginia, harrassed by Gen
ri . . - - J .31?

Washington, Dec. 7. The President's
Message is ready. It is probable it will
not be sent to Congress before Wednes
day, as there is considerable doubt
whether the House will be ready to re
ceive it before two or three o'cloek to
morrow, by which time the Senate will
have adjourned.
me "most important ana imeresimg
portions of the message, are those which
deal with the subject of Slavery and the
restoration to the Union of States that
have been in rebellion. In what the
President ; says regarding the former
topic, be considers the Emancipation
Proclamation as an accomplished fact,
lie holds. that the proclamation liberated
all the Slaves witiin the territory which
it embraced, and all fu ture action must
be bayed ' on that snpposition. In a
word, the President does not, and will

the slave the vestige of a right in hini-

In another part of the mes
sage the President alludes to the
victories gained during the year, and
dwells at some length upon the progress
and present aspect and prospects of the
war.
A bill creating the onioe of Lieuten
ant General, of which notice is given, to
day, by Mr. Washburne of Illinois,
is fn tended to give Gen. Grant the posi
tion, which his talent and his victories
are generally thought to entitle him.
