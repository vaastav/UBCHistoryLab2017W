policy in the Philippines
THE CURRENCY QUESTION.
IN his mtasage, President M'Kinley very wisely did not go
deeply into the currency question, because he knows that
this Congress will not take up the subject, and that luttr
judgment before action is taken would naturally be belter.
The message treated finance and currency as follows :
FINANCE AND CLUUENCY.
The Secretary of the Treasury eports that the receipts of the
government from all sources during the Usual year ended June 30
1808, including *114.751,‘223 received from sale of Pacific Dailroud’
amounted to *405,321,335, M"d its expenditures to *443.308,582 There
was collected from fusion - 143,675,002, and from Internal revenue
*170.000,041. Our utiabe imports amounted to $324,635,479, a
dscreaso of *58,150,0: 0 over the preceding year, and importations free
of duty amounted lo *291.414,175. u decrease from the preceding year
of *90,524,008. Internal revenue receipts exceeded those of the pre
ceding year by *24,212.007.
The total lax collected on distilled spirits was *92,540,099; on
manufactured tobacco, *30,230,522, and on fermented liquors
*39.615,421. We xported merchandise during the year amounting
to *1,231 482.330. an increase of *180,488,774 from the preceding year.
ll is Estimated upon the basis ol the present revenue laws that
the receipts of the government for tin* year ending June 30, 1899, will
be *577,874.017, and its expenditures *089,874,047, rr suiting’ In a
deficiency of *112,000 000.
On the first day of December, 1898, there whs held in the Trea
sury gold coin amounting to *138,441,547. gold bullion amounting to
*138,502,545. silver bullion amounting to *93.359,250, the other forms
of money amounting to *451,903,981.
Ou the same date the amount of money of all kinds in circula
tion, or not included in Treasury holdings, was an
for the year of *165,794,960. Estimating our population ut
75.194.000 at the time mentioned the per capita circulation was *25 09.
On the same date there was in the Treasury gold bullion amounting
to *138,502,545.
The provisions made for strengthening the resources of the
Treasury in connection with the war has given increased confidence
in the purpose and power of the government to maintain the present
standard and lihs established wore firmly than ever the national
credit at home and abroad. A marked evidence is found in the
inflow of gold to the Treasury. Its net gold holdings ou November 1,
1898, were *239,885,102 as compared with *158,573 147 ou November 1,
1897, and an increase of net chsli of *207,750,100, November 1, 1897,
to *300,288 275, November 1, 1898. The present ratio of not Treasury
gold to outstanding government liabilities. Including United States
notes, Treasury notes of 1890, silver certificates, currency certificates,
standard silver dollars, and fractional silver coin. November 1, 1898,
was 25.35 per cent, as compared with 10.90 per cent., November 1,
1897.
I renew so much of my recommendation of December, 1897, as
follows:
That when any of the United States notes are presented for
redemption in gold and are redeemable iu gold, such notes shall be
kept and set apart and only paid out in exchange for gold. This is
an obvious duty. If the holder of the United States note prefers the
gold and gets it from the government, he should not receive back from
the government a United States note without paying gold in exchange
for it. The reason for this is made all the more apparent when the
government issues an interest-bearing debt to provide gold for the
redemption of United States notes— a non-interest-bearing debt.
Surely it should not pay them out again except on demand and for
gold. If they are put out iu any other way, they may return again,
to he followed by another bond issue to redeem them—another
interest-bearing debt to redeem a non Interest-bearing debt.
GOLD STANDARD.
This recommendation was made in the belief that such provisions
of law would insure to a greater degree the safety of the present
standard, and better protect our currency from the dangers to which
it is subjected from a disturbance in the general business conditions
of the country.
In my judgment, the present condition of the Treasury amply
justifies the immediate enactment of the legislation recommended one
year ago, under which a portion of the gold holdings should be
placed in h trust fund from which greenbacks should be redeemed
upon presentation, but when once redeemed should not thereafter be
paid out except for gold.
it is not to be inferred that other legislation relating to our cur
rency Is not required; on the contrary, there is an obvious demand

I'HE short of closiii){ session or the Fifty-fifth met

1 Ointrlpy offered the oustomary resolution for the appoint
ment of a committee of three to join a similar committee
of the Senate to wait upon the President and inform him that the
House was ready to receive any communication he had to make.
It was unanimously adopted and Speiker lieed appointed Messrs.
I)in)jley and Cannon (Kep., 111.), and Bailey (Dem., Tex.) A
resolution was also adopted informing the Senate that the House
was ready to primped to business.
When tile House reconvened after recess the committee ap
pointed to wait upon the President tepoited, and Major Prnden,
the President’s executive clerk, announced the message of the
President.
The real of the envelope in which the message was contained
was broken by the Speaker himself, and it was immediately laid
before the House. Phe members on the lloor and spectators gave
the reading their moat earnest attention.
Mr. Cousins ( Hep,, Iowa) introduced the first hi 11 in the

in the journalistic field of Cecil are sure to contribute not only
toward the advancement of Port Deposit hut of the county at
large.
PRESIDENT M’KINLEY’S WISE MESSAGE.
PRESIDENT M’KINLEY’S message was hut another evi
dence of his greatness, and in no feature of it did he
show better bis good judgment than in the treatment of
the Philippine question. He said all that could well lie
said in the light of present knowledge in the case, and Iris course
once more demonstrates that he is at all times considerate of the
opinions, and solicitous for the welfare, of the people at large. The
time bail not come for him to indulge in any discourse upon this
important question, and his notion is to be commended.
President McKinley’s reference to our new possessions wa-:
1 do not discuss at this time the government or the future of the
new possessions which will come to us as the result of the war with
Spain. Such discussion will he appropriate after the treaty of peam
shall he ratified. In the meantime anil uutil the Congress has legis
lated otherwise it will lie my duty to continue the military govern
ments which have existed since our occupation ami give to the
people security in life aud property and enecuragoment uuder a just
and beneficent rule.
Until the treaty of peace with Spain is ratified, no discus-con
of tile question is called for on the part of the President, his duly
being—just as President McKinley has done —the continuance of
military governments. And in this first decision he certainly lias
the cordial approval of the American people, his determination
being to keep the administration of tire conquered islands out of
politics as much as possible by confiding the fiduciary positions in
army officers. The high standard of integrity which prevails
among officers as a part of their military education and of the
military code of honor insures a thoroughly honest administration
of tire affairs of tire islands. And in his tariff policy President
McKinley was most wise.
With regard to his message upon the Philippines and
Porto Kico—merr of judgment certainly should appreciate the
Prrsident’s wisdom of making neither a recommendation nor a
suggestion at this time regarding this country’s future course.
Little can ret lie known, aud under I lie present military gimrn
ments every month will bring forth knowledge concerning tire
relations between these properties and our country—and in want
of this experience it would he the crowning act of foolishness to
attempt to shape public opinion at this time. In the case of Cuba
however, the relations voluntarily assumed by tire Unite.) States
made it necessary that suggestions be offered by the President
and which point lie disposed of most ably, as follows;
Aa soon as we are iu possession of Cuba and have pacified the
island it will bo necessary to give aid and direction to its people to
form a government for themselves. This should be undertaken at
the earliest moment consistent with safely and assured snece.-s. It is
important that our relations with this people shall he of the most
friendly character and our commercial relations close arid reciprocal.
It should be our duty to assist in every proper way to build up the
waste places of the island, encourage the iudustry of the people, ami
assist them to form a goverumeul that shall he free and independent,
thus realizing the best aspirations of the Caban people.
Spanish rule must be replaced by a just, benevolent ao,l humane
government, crested by the people of Cuba, capable of performing all
international obligations and which shall encourage thrift, industry
and prosperity, and promote peace and good will among all of the
inhabitants, whatever may have been their relations in the past.
Neither revenge nor passion should have a place in the new govern
ment. Until there is complete tranquillity in the island and a stable
government inaugurated military occupation will he continued.
And because of this foresight and wisdom our thanks are due
our honored President.
