to the ocean mail act of 1801. The post

tains the general subsidy for all vessels,
steam or sail, which are not under mail
Icon tracts. This general subsidy is uni
form, 1 per cent per gross ton per 100
nautical miles for not exceeding 10 entries
in one year.
To promote the building of new ocean
vessels an additional allowance of 1-4 of a
cent jwr gross ton is made for five years,
j Any vessel to receive the general sub
sidy must carry mails if required, and
must train in seamanship or engineering
American youth for each 1000 tons, the
vessel to lie at the service of the govern
im nt if required for defense.
Any vessel to receive subsidy must b«»

►el shall receive only one form of subsidy,
and that a vessel which has received a

subject to the provisions of the present
treaty, the said government shall have
and enjoy all the rights incident to
such construction, as wel las the exclus
ive right) of providing for the regula
tion and management of the canal.

traffic or otherwise. Such conditions
and charges of traffic shall ibe Just and
equitable.
2. The canal shall never Im> blockad
ed, nor shall any right of war be exer
cised, nor any act of hostility com
mitted within It. The United States,
however, shall be at liberty to main
tain such military police along the
canal as may be necessary to protect It
against lawlessness and disorder.
3. Vessels of war of a belligerent
shall not revictual, nor take any stores
