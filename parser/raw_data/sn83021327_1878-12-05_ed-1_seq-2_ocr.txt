THE 1UESSAGK,
Congress assembled Monday, aud
tine morning we give our readers a
telegraphic synopsis of the President's
message. The President, while very
wild in tone, ascribes the changed po
litical results in South Carolina and in
Louisiana to overriding the lately, en
franchised black voters of the South.
Certainly he Las not yet been
informed ot results ia the
fifth congressional district in Texas,
where Uancock, an intense Union man,
has been defeated for Congress by
Wash Jones, a Confederate, and whose
election is due to 15,000 black votes,
driven by ex-Governor Davis, chief of
Radicalism in Texas, supported by the
fiercest of the Confederate last-ditchers.
When he knows all this he may
regret that to please his party, lie
made an empty assertion. The truth
Is, the negroes of South Carolina and
of Louisiana have learned t have con
fidence in the old slave-owners. They
know, too, that Radicalism has sent
.among them the grandest setof thieves
that ever infested any country, and
hence they are ready to follow an hon
est Hampton. And now we may ex
pect, as even intimated by the Presi
dent, that Congress may be called
upon to abridge the political rights of
the negro. When lost to the Repub
lican party it will become his greatest
enemy.
THE PRESIDENT AND THE
1ICLZ.UOZEBS.
It IS quite impOSSlbl io comprehend
tbt agencies employed by Radical
party-leaders in fastening the convic
tion on the President's mind that
everywhere ia the South negroes have
been denied the privilego of voting as
tbey pleased. Like the canaille of
New York the colored people of the
,uth are first at the polling places.
For some inconceivable reason, know
ing little of the results of elections and
having no concepon of their effects
upon legislation or public poliey, ex
pecting no personal advantages end
assured of the perpetuity of their own
freedom, it is difficult to account for
the earnest eagerness with which the
ignorant mass crowds the voting
places. It is, however, the ex
ercise of the highest privilege
of freemen and Africa is free
while Africa votes. But there is
bo accounting for the coarse these
voters pursue. Why it has happened
that the negroes voted solidly against
an unwavering Unionist and for an
earnest rebel for Congress in this dis
trict, defeating John Hancock end co
operating in this with the red Republi
can, original secessionists of this dis
trictwhy these incidents distin
guished recent elections Mr. Hayes
may be puzzled to determine. In
other States, as ia South Carolina, the
negroes have quarreled with the carpet
baggers anajvoted for a Hampton or us
a Hampton advised, and for this the
whitea are condemned and all sorts of
prosecutions are pending, as happens
In Texas, before extraordinary Fed
eral tribunals for the purpose of
making it appear that violence
and outrage haye been employed by
whites in order to frighten negroes
from polling places. Thus far it has
not been made to appear in Texas that
any combinations have been made to
feat the beneficent purposes of Con
gress or restrict the negro' freedom.
Instances of individual quarrels and
tights are adduced, but these distin
guish quite as often the relations of
ignorant whites as of whites to blacks,
and there it gross wrong in gathering
ia accounts of all these trifling per
sonal conflicts, unless it be shown at
the same time how numberless were
the towns and villages and country
stores where elections were held and
negroes voted oltea as repeaters, and
yet no violence was done or resistance
c&red. There were fewer fights and
quarrels oa election day in all the
Bjuth, where four million white and
one million negro votes were polled,
than ia the fighting wards of New
York city, represented by the bellicose
Sunset Cox. Rat delicious partisanship
collates with painstaking care each
iucidect of each white and black
shindy and the catalogue of enormities
tuutnci a frightful aspect.
Evidently, Cob Iagersoll, B!une and
Cockling, with the President follow
ing along modestly and gingerly
t aough in their wake, are going cfT on
another cras3o beneith the banner of
the b'.oody shirt. The triumph of
Radicalism and its protracted niaintc-n-ooe
of power depend upon the sec
tionalism of the cotllxt. United
StaUa ccir.mLsioncr supply the msie
r'.ala, and those idiotic white men, who
furnish this capital for Rtdkul trades
men ia f fjee and power by fighting
negroes and degrading themselves and
the people cf tho Sutb, are the choic
est tools and agents of Eiaine, Coak-,,'.-g

Mies? luckksj S:ste3. rBi.'.-

scribed in the President's message,
should be extirpated by the South.
T ix. n io.nT iTVoiTxt;.
The Eicon ballot-box is crmmen-Ied
ia strocg terms by macy newspspcrs.
B.coa lias been a benefactor of man
kind frrm Noah's time. Btcon was
the prcfoundtst of philosophers', and
many good people believe that bacon
was the real author of "Shskspeare."
Very certainly he is the inventor of a
device, cheep and simple, which ren
ders many commonplace election frauds
impossible. The mechanism of the
box is very simple. Ic numbers every
ballot with a detective combination,
preventing "stuSng" and instantly
showing spurious ballots. It has
been tested by skillful export", who
have sruht to eyade its t.peration,
but in every pt.iut it stems to be
guarded, except in that wlr.ch
most needs watchfulness aud security.
It cancct distinguish ccuntenanct9.
The same man may vote early and
often. AVe have seen wagons freight
ed with voters who went from one to
another polling place and voted again
and again. When whitky stood up
against decency and good morals,
brandishing the knife and pistol, it
also thrust polluted ballots into count
Ices boxes. Negroes voted again and
again from the rising to the setting
sun. White men are distinguishable
from one another, but judges of elec
tions are impotent to detect black
"repeaters," and in many towns and
counties of Texa, since there is no re
straint and no Bicon ballot-box
or other means of restricting the
number of ballots thrust into
the boxes, elections are worse than
farcical, and decent, honest people
will not vote. Bacon's ballot-box
prevents many frauds, but until voters
of each civil district are numbered, and
none are suffered to vote except at
their own polling place, and until
none vote who have not paid at least a
poll tax, there can be little value at
tached by the ciliz?n to the privilege
of suffrage. It would shock one's sen
sibilities when depositing his ballot in
the box, and, turning away, to behold
an ourang-outang neutralizing the ef
fects and proper results of wise and
honest voting. We have no voting apes
in this country, but then we may have
and the sheriff should be empowered
to guard absolutely and protect relig
iously the purity of the ballot-box.
This invention of Mr. Bicon is a per
fect safeguard against many irregulari
ties and frauds, but until none vote
who cannot show a tax receipt the
foulest outrages and most villainous
frauds will be perpetrated. Mr. Bacon
will surely be paid well for bis anti-fat
ballot-box in Bastrop and Wharton
counties ; but the evil to be remedied
cannot be obviated until each voter is
restricted not only to his o:vn ward or
precinct, but until he must present,
when he deposits his ballot, a receipt
in full for taxes.
IIQl'OR I.ERISL.11 ION.
ILirjier's Weelly says that the New
York Court of Appeals has declared
the ciyil damage act to be constitu-
tlOLttL Th:o net holds both thA sol. op
of liquor and the owner of the prem
ises upon which liquor is sold respon
sible for any violation of law in conse
quence ol drunkenness caused by the
liquor. It is, of course, a law passed
in the interest cf temperance. It rec
ognizes the right of society to regulate
the sale of intoxicating liquorp, as a
license law recognises it, and its direct
operation is to prevent leases for liq
uor shops except to those who will not
abuse the privilege of sale. A news-,
paper which opposes the law asserts
that it violates the principles of justice
and equity. The ground of such a
comment is, of course, that a mau
driuks at his own risk, and if he
breaks the peace the law already pro
vides for bis punishment. It is equal
ly true that a man smokes a pipe near
a powdcr-mag&zine at his own risk,
but society has rights as well as the
individua1, and society, to protect it
self, regards gunpowder as an excep
tionally dangerous property, and regu-
lates its manufacture and storage as it
does not those of other properties.
In tho same way it argues that
liquor is an agent sure to be abused,
and proved by experience to be the
cause of enormous taxation by the
crime which it produces, and which
necessitates police and prisons. It as
serts, therefore, the right to regulate
its dangerous iue as a beverage, and
one ot the obvious ways to do this is to
put a check upon its careless sale by
holding the person who lets a shop for
that purpose responsible for the dam
age that may arise from making a man
drunk. It is a case in which a society
seeks to protect itself by preventing
disorder, and the argument against it
is an argument apainst any regulation
of the liquor traffic
Liquor legislation ia a matter of ex
pediency, and springs from the right
of society to protect itself by methods
which involve no disregard of sound
and conservative fundamental princi
ples. Individual liberty of action mui t
be defended up to the point where ex
perience proves that the common liber
ty requires an individual restriction.
That warning of experience can be as
certained only by common consent or
by the voice of a legal majority. It is
a maxim of the law that a man intends
the natural and obvious consequences
of bis acts. When he sells or fur
nishes the means of selling to another
man something that he knows will de
Btroy the moral and conscious responsi
bility of the buyer, why should he not be
responsible for the result t If the buyer
ought to be held responsible far drink
ing what be knoars will steal his wits,
certainly he ought not to escape who
makes a living bv it. Tlie particular
case which was appealed wis that of a
son who drove his father's horse on
Sunday to a "hotel" ia Orange coooty,
and titers mide himsoif drunk, and
drove the horse to death. Tbe father
sued both landlord and trna&t to re
cover the value of the horse. Jnt jary
gave him a verdict, and upon the ap
peal cf the landlord and tenant the
Court of Appeal afHrmed the judg
ment. St. Locts J.j iV.Ai" ."The pc."fi

People having an extraordinary
stock of piety were little inclined to
approve the rc-;rect'ni of the whip
p:rg p'ist ia the Sr.u'.hern S:-tts. Bat
we have retrograded in nigral and de
cency and advanced in vice. The
slate of src:tty is worse than fiity
years sg-.; rricies arc committed and
deeds of violence occur, such as were
not known prior to 1S00. Death and
tnurJ-r and the digging of a
unllioa grivc, end destruction of nine
thousaud niliiion3 of propeity in the
South were by co means the chiefest
results of the war. The people have
been made retkleS3 aud vicious as
never before, and law3, at least for the
next ten years, must be adapted to
this state of society and morals. We
cmnot maintain armies of knavc3 in
penitentiaries and especially when we
know that this punishment, when ap
plied to a larjc class of its citizn, is
by no mean remedial. The Baltimore
G-iutte say?:
"Saturday was whipping-Jay in
New Castle, Del., and nioe convicts,
six of them black, received at the
hands of the shentl from ten to twenty
lashes, a large crowd, as usual, assem
bled to look on, and the day was made
a sort of a lecsl holiday. There seems
to have be-in a feeling of disappoiat
ment araoog those present, for a corre
spondent says: 'rthenfl Pyle ltfid on
the lashes too lightly, but it is said in
his behalf that be is a new hand at
the buaine.o?, and may rival his prede
cessor! eventually, who could make
the thong draw blood at every stroke.'
There has been much denunciation of
the whinpinp-post, and inhumanity
and barbarity Iihs been cried against it
by its opposers, but tbe fact remains
that Delaware, where it is used, is
freer from crime than most any Stale
in the Union; spends very little money
on jails and criminal prosecutions and
is one of the few States entirely out of
debt."
The feeling dominant in the North,
and to which the President lends the
approval of his fame and greatness, is
illustrated in this excerpt from tho New
York Tribune. We cannot compre
hend these things. The focus in which
terrible stories of alleged Southern out
rages ia concentrated is in the North
and not in the South. We see and
hear nothmg of these devilish deed?,
and yet the North hears of them and
sees them everywhere. The relations
between the j-sces here is as kindly as
among Americana and Germans or
Irishmen. But the New York Triliune
says:
The South may rest assured that
these objects of the war have not been
and will not be abandoned. As long
as the South is solid, by disloyal and
dishonorable methods, in behalf of a
dishonest and disloyal party, the North
will be found solid also. But it may
as wpII be added that the defiance of
the Constitution and the disregard of
its guarantees will surely be stopped,
and that at no distant day.
Tue World says that the law points
out to the President the path in which
he is to tread, but Republican wire
pullers may be assured that neither
from this nor from the next Congress
will they get power to interfere in a
State election either in Massachusetts
or in the South. If there be a condi
tion of civilization or of partisanship
which instigates or tolerates election
acts at the South which arc not insti
gated or tolerated at the North, then
let the South be condemned according
ly. But Gen. Butler oughc to be ex
amined as to whether thero is any
more immorality ia elections there
than in Massachusetts and New York.
Only iu the latter States the police are
auditioned to suppress or prevent vio
lence and ballot-box stuffing, and that
s the difference.
TueNjw Yoik M-iil says that the
words ' immoital soul," " deathless
soul," " undying soul," " deathless
spirit," "disembodied soul," "disem
bodied rpirit," " eternal torment,"
"eternal suffering m conscious misery,"
"eternal misery," "unending misery,"
" unending torment," " everlasting
woe," endless woe," " never-dying
soul," and all their kiudred words are
words that never, in a single instance,
are found in the Bible. Bat from the
copious manner in which these words
are passed to us from the pulpit and
through the press, we should, without
realm?, suppose the B.blo lull of
them! The word "immortal" occurs
but once in the whole Bible.
The negroes of the District of Co
lumbia are making preparations, says
the Star, to give public expression
with reference to the recent political
outrage to which the cobred voters of
the South have been subjected. The
ntgrocs and their white coadjutors in
Southern Texas, says the Brenham
Banner, having elected no less than
five of their colored brethren to the
State Legislature, and also a member
of Congress, should send a protest to
their brethren in the District of Colum

The Commercial notices an evil and
tells about a remedy that may be ap
plied: "A short-ighted legislature,
with no practical knowledge concern
ing railroads or appreciation of the
value of time, made a law compelling
railroad trains in this State to stop at
every station not less than five minutes
a law that is an imposition upon both
the railroads ana the traveling public
but of no earthly advantage to the
towns along tbe roads. The law is not
generally observed, bat the railroads
realizi the fact that by violating it
they lay themsolves liable to annoyance
and prosecution at the hands of any per
son who may haye a petty spite against
them lor some real or lmiginary wrong.
So great has this annoyance become
that it is rntnored the leading officials
cf the Texas railroads will soon hold a
meeting to devise means to put aa end
to the inconvenience at least as far as
the traveling public is concerned. We
bear it stated that one proposition is to
make all regular passenger trains
" through trains," stopping at only the
principal towns along tbe tine, and
carrying all local passenger traffic on
freight trains. This would be a pret
ty severe remedy, but it would caase
the people themselves to demand the
repeal of the piesent unreasonable law.

to stop at stations only a reasonable

right cootiDiics to he of paramount in
terest with the great body of our peo
ple, tyery step in this direction is
welcomed with public approval aud
every interruption of the steady t,nd

summation awakens general uneasiness
and wide-spread condemnation. The
recent congressional elections have fur
nished a direct, trustworthy test of tbe
advance thus far made in the practical
establishment of the right of suffrage.
secured bv the dnstitution to the
liberated race in tho Southern States
All disturbing iDlluenccs, real aud
imaginary, had been removed from all
of these States. Three constitutional
amendments, which conferred freedom
and equality of civil and political
rights upon the colored people of the
South, were adopted by the concurrent
action of a great bodv of gcod citizens.
who maintained the autherity of the
national government snd the integrity
ana perpetuity oi the Lnion at such a
cost of treasure aud life, as a wise and
necessary embodiment in. the organic
law of the just results of the war. The
people of the former slave-holding
States accepted these results and gave
in every practicable foim assurtuces
that the thiiteeutli, fourteenth aud fif
teenth amendments and laws pissed in
pursuance thereor, should in good faith
be enforced rigidly and impartially in
letter and spirit to the end that the
humblest citizen, wjtbout distinction
of race or color, should undir them re
ceive full and equal protection in per
son and property, and political rights
and privileges. By these constitution
al amendments the southern portion of
tbe Union obtained a large increase of
political power in Congress and in the
Electoral College, and the country
justly expected that elections would
proceed, as to the enfranchised race.
upon the same circumstancaa of legal
and constitutional freedom and pro
tection which obtained in all other
States of the Union, which the friends
of law and order looked for. The con
duct of these elections is offering to
the general judgment of the country an
important opportunity to measure the
degree in which the right of t-uffroge
could be exercised by the colored
people, and would bo protected by
tneir leiiow-citizeuc, but' a more
general enjoyment ot freedom of
suffrage by tbe colored people and a
more just and generous protection of
that lreedom by tbe communities of
which they form a part was generally
anticipated than the record of clee
tions disclose. In some of these States
in which the colored people have been
unable to make their opinions felt in
elections, the result is mainly due to
miiuences not easily measured or rem
edied by legal protection, but in the
States of L iuisiaua and S.mtli Caroli
na at large and some particular con
gressional districts outside of those
States, the records of elections seem to
compel the conclusion that the rights
of colored voters haye been overridden
and their participation in elections not
permitted to be general or free. It will
be for Congress, for which these elec
tions were held, to make such extuni
nations into their conduct as may be
appropriate to determine the validity
oi the claims ot members to their seats,
In the meanwhile, it becomes the dnty
oi the executive and judicial -depart
ments of the government, each in its
province, to inquire into and punish
the violations of laws in the United
States which have occurred.
I can but repeat what I said in this
connection in my last message: That
whatcyer authority rests with me to
this end I shall not hesitate to
put forth, and I am unwilling to fore
go a renewed appeal to the legislatures,
cnurts, executive authorities and pec
pie of the States where these wrongs
have been perpetrated to give their as
sisistance towards bringing to justice
the oiienderj and preventing a re pet i
tion of these crimes No means within
my power will be spared to obtain a
fall and fair investigation of the alleged
crimes and to secure the conviction and
just punishment oi the guilty. 11 is
to be observed that the principal appro
priation maae i r tne department of
Justice at the last session contained
the following clause, "and for defray
ing expenses which may be incurred in
tbe enforcement of tbe act approved
February 28, 1871, entitled An act to
amend an act approved May 30, 1S70.
entitled 'an act to enforce the rights
of citizens of the United States to vote
in the several States of the Union and
for other purposes or any acts amend-
tory thereor or supplementary
thereto.'" It is the opinion of
tbe Attorney General that the ex
penses of these proceedings will
largely exceed the amount which was
thus provided, and I rely confidently
npon oongress to make adequate ap
propriations to enable the Executive
Department to enforce the laws. I res
pectfully nrge uo n your attention that
the congressional elections in every
district, in a very important sense,
are justly a matter of political inter
est and concern throughout the whole
country. In each State everv politi
cal panv is entitled to a share of
power which is conferred bv legal
and constitutional suffrage, and
it is the right -of every citizen
possessing tbe qualifications prescribed
by law to cat one nnintimidated ballot
ana to nave bis ballot honestlv count
ed. Sn long as tbe exercise of this
power and the enjoyment of this right
are common and cqaal, practically
as well as formally, submission to
the results of suffrage will be ac
corded loyally and cbeerfally. and all
depar'rneuts oi government will feel
the true vhzor of popular will thus
expressed. N u mpirary or adminis
trative interoH of U''vefnmtnt. how
ever urgent or weighty, will ever dis
place the z -al or our people in defense
of the primary rights cf citizenship.
They understand that protection of
liberty require the maintenance of
suffrage and will sustain the fall au
thority of the government to enforce
the law, which are framed to d reserve
these inestimable rights. The materi
al progress and welfare of the States
depend apon the protection afforded
to their citizens. There can be no
peace without tuch protection no i
property without peace, and the whole
country U deeply interested la the
grow in acd prosperity or alt-lta parts.
While tbe country & not yet reached
a complete unity of feeling and recip
rocal confidence between communities
so lately and so seriously estranged, I
foci an absolute a-su.ance that tenden
cies are in that direction and with ic
creusiig torco aud p.wer of public
cpinioa will override all political pr
J id ces an t all stc:ional or Si.i-e at-
tachmouis, m dtunuding that a'.l over
ur wi ie territory the mme and char
acter of a citizen of t'lo Tailed Sta cs
shall mean ouo aid the same thin-, and
snail carry with them unchallenged
socurdy and respect.
A favorable view is taken of tlie cf
tablishment cf the Chine lcgiti. n in
the United State, i-n 1 mention i
made that a tr- aty looking to the fur
therance of commercial intercourse
between Japan and America his been
made and will be submitted for the
consideration of the Sn.a?e. The
President then refers brinly to the
Halifax award, saying the coi vrspon :
ence would be laid before C ir.res.
While cxpresiing rordidtinc in the
strength of tbe Mexican government
to repress incursions on our territory tic
says he shall take the earliest opportu
nity to recognize their ability to re
strain these maurau. ling patties, and
hopes that thecoming intern iti- ul ex
position in Mexico will tend to bet
ter the understanding and ir.creaed
commercial intercourse between the
two countries.
After summarizing S!tertnai.'a rep ort,
the President says: "In the prct-nt
financial condition of tbo country I am
persuaded that the welfare f legiti
mate husinea and industry f crcry
description will be best promoted by
abstaining from all attempts to make
radical changes in existing financial
legislation. Let it le understood tha
during the coming year the business of
the country will le undislmhod by
governmental interference with the
laws affecting it, aud we may confi
dently expect that the resumption of
specie payment", which will take
place at the appointed time, will be
successfully nnd easily maintained aad
that it will be followed by n healthful
and enduring revival of biuinc. pios
pcrity."
The creation of additional circuit
judges was recommended as a remedy
for tbe delay of justice, and poosibly
of oppression to suitors, occasioned by
the great increase in the business of
the Supreme Court and of the courts
in many of the circuits.
The President concurs in the recom
mendation of the Secretaries of War
and Interior that Congress provide for
the organization of a corps of mounted
Indian auxiliaries to be uudcr control
of the army and be used to keep un
ruly Indiana on their reservations or
repres disturbances. Thia would
weaken the restless clement among lu
dians by giving a number of the young
men congenial employment and would
aid the army in tlie task for which its
numerical strength 13 sometimes insuf
ficient. The President thiuks, how
ever, that, although the force must
occasionally bo employed to prevent or
repress Indiau troubles and wise prep
aration should be made of that descrip
tion, greater reliance must be placed
upon humane and civilizing agencies
for the ultimate solution of the Indian
problem. It is alike our duty aud in
terest to help the Imlians attain the
highest degree of civilization possible
for them, and the past experience with
many troops affords great encourage
ment for the continuance of the civiliz
ing policy. The President expresses
no opinion whether or not control of
the Indian service should be trans
ferred from the Interior to the War
Department, but he hopes Congress, in
deciding that pending question, will
not overlook the considerations above
indicated.
