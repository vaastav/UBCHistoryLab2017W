The delay in arranging the Senate committees

Mr. Stevens ( Pa 1, from the Committee of Way?
und Means, reported back the joint resoluti an
explanatory of so much of the Internal Uevenuo
act us referred to the duty on cigars (an abstract
of winch whs printed on 'Wednesday morning).
Mr. lliooks (N. Y.) said that tho' Secretary of
the Treasury hud recommended the tax, and ha
now wi.-hed to know whether the Commi'tee of
H uys und Means intended to change the duty on
lonaeoo.
Mr. Stevens replied that ho had given the su''
jict some consideration, but he did not know
what the conclusion of the committee would be.
Mr. Brooks suggested that the bill be postponed
for a few days for further examination.
Mr. Stevcnii remVd tutu in the opinion of tluHO
tK-st instructed the Department had lost millions
of dollars by the coui.iructi.rn of tho Commis
sioner of Internal Hevenue,
Mr. brooks said in the opinion of a large num
ber of manufacturers, it was quite impossible
under the principle ol tho luweverti have honest
n, anufacluring ol cigars. The temptation was so
great, tiie duty so immense, ami the punishment
so severe, as to render it utmost impossible te
prevent frauds.
iiy tne measure now n lore tnem tuere was no
doubt, trom the last iiifoi'inatiou, that tin) best
way was to attach a one cent stamp to each
ciar sold, aud this would produce u larger
ri venue than the principle 'ia tho bill.
Mr. Stevens explained that utl the committee
had done wus to put a proper construction on the
law, in contradiction to a very erroneous decision
ol the Commissioner of Internal Revenue.
Mr. Dawes (Mass.) said that some of the manu
facturers had g'opped nearly cntiicly in cinso
qiionie of the very singular construction of tu j
law. The construction went beyond even tho
law ib-elf.
lie thought something more thin a simple
joint resolution was necessary t' reuiedv tho d'-
I Inla Mas. - fi,, il .1,

would be patient in clearing up the dillicultics
whic h i-nrround the subject.
Mr. S evens then proceeded to show that ninc
tetiihs ol the cigars manufactured sinca Congress
adjourned, hud paid but S I instead of frs a thou
sand, owing to the construction of tho Commis
sioner of Internal Revenue. The measure peiidiml
was fere lcpcaled to give the proper couslracuon
to the law.
Mr. Prooks expressed the hope that the Cotn
niittee would take time to consult with hunest
manufacturers in order to remove the existing
(lilhciiilics by, as the Secret try of the Treasury
hud r commended, a owy on leal lon&cco.
A duty oh cigars should ha ronsidercj in the
same connection. He r.'pc ilcd that experienced
liicn had ad', is, il a st laip duty on eii'ars, si nil ir
to postage siamps. Fay oiie C 'nt, as yielding the
laigest revenue. T.'ie tempt ition to smuggling,
fn m Canada nnd :lsi where, was now irres sii lo.
Old stiimpi d cti ar bows we.re used in wbi 'lt to
put new cigars, and so a stamp alone would stop
this, I'osioes rei.l ng I be largest revenue.
Mr. l.ionurd Myers (l'.i.) trusted the stihHet
would be ai ted upon t once, as, owing t-j the
pre-ent ronstrnetinn, the revenue of tho G jvcrfl
nieiit n niucu reduced (rom ih it source.
Mr. 11 issoi. down) adv ateJ ihe passw of
the pending proposition, showing that every il .y

FINANCE AND COMMERCC
Omca c Thi Km!' Timoiin, I
7 iiurtS, l..'mtr s, (
The movement in Stocks to which we allude 1
yesterday, as the consequence o the calm but
firm tone of tho President's Message, was chc kod
somewhat hy tho foolish tinkering of Congress
with the finances. It has been our disagreeable
duty, on more than one occasion, to declirc
against legislation npon gold, and in every in
stance the pernicious tdfcc'S of the m- asares we
denounced were visible in fortyight hours af cr
the nr.lclc was written.
Pis the niisfortnno of the country that men
whom wr ele t to On.'rcs", however cmit.'nt
they may be as lawyers or politicians, hava not- 5
In the main, an acquaintance with business ad ils I
intimate enough to warrant ha'ty fegtsV.i 1 1
upon the ordinary trade Interests of the nation;
and it s ead of doing as is done In Kag'au 1, '
Fibiire, and even in Russia, i. r., calling the lead- I
lug men In any given business into counsel, and
so niasterit g the subject, all sorts of cndi and
ill-digested measures are attempted or adopted,
nnd great intcrefts unsettled or jeoparduod before
the blunder Is discovered. Tho tinkering with
the tariff at the close of the last session was an
instance of thlssortof folly. The prices of silk
goods were advanced .'10 per cent, in a day, and
Importers and holders of such goods were put ull
at sea by this surprising act, which nearly dou.
bled the duties without notice. Orders in Luropo
had to be suddenly countermanded, an 1 con
sumers found prices marked tin over night, from
;id to W -T cent, on articles which th"y ln'eded
Immediately.
'Il.e currency came in for the same kWd of
inco moderate legislation, and acts in relati n to
gold were passed aud repealed with a ma.5ic.1l
celerity that would have astonished Wit, but
which was perfectly disgraceful to the National
Lcgisla urc. Our readers will remember how wo
expostulated In regard to the Gold bill, and how
quickly "ur worst fears were realized ; for it was
manifest 10 tlig most shallow clerk in any
broker's (lice, that if the loyal people, who were
resisting the gold rl-e by selling largely when
cvir it was put np, were prevented altogether
from dealing iu it, that a few experts Oiuld carry
the pi ire np ten or twenty per cent, any day they
pleuseU ; f.nd the result wiii just as we had fore- ! in Nation to the parties who sell gold mi spceu
' ., latum and claim that they are cxouipt trom tlx
told.
As if the folly of the last session was not suf
fu iei.Cy glguntic, we have at this session, on the
very lirst (hiv, a repetition of this sublime non
sense, with improvements and variations. It was
propieed not only to mako gold transictlous
penal, but it was resolved to cmircrt paper itfn
)nlil hi 'in net of CvHiiiest. Now, when these
gentlemen can perform this feat, if they will
"call spirits from the vasty deep," they will find
tl.em appear upon the lloor of the House with
tl'rmonds in tiieir laps, ready to shower them iu
prof, ion upon such grand magicians.
Gold it as much an article of merchandise now
as coin, and Is a- liable to be affected by tho law
Of mi ply and demand. Both may be changed
in pre favorably or adversely by speculation;
but i o law on earth can change their essential
Character. If we attempt to feed tweu'.y thousand
men on a half-peck uf crn meal we shall fail ; if
we attempt to pay a million of men a high salary
in gold out of twenty millions, we shall probably
fail also. We shall be obliged, we think, to select
some other commodity, iu both cases, to consum
mate our purpose. If auy act of Congress could
possibly accomplish this feat, surely tho present
body woullbe the one to attempt it.
It will be found, however, tiiat if we are to
carry on this gigantic war for the suppression of
this wicked Rebellion, we must feed and pay our
men; and if we have not gold, we must have
paper; and if we cannot keep down prices whilo
we go on expanding nnd spending money, we aro
in the same tlx that all nations have been who
have had heavy wars upon their hands, and have
adopted paper us the medium of exchange between
the buyer and seller. The only things that will
keep down gold are contraction, taxation, rigid
economy, and bold strokes at the foe in tho ficld
As for all the rest. Congressional speeches, acts of
legislation, town nice ings, newspaper articles,
and telegraph despatches about a starving enemy,
aud reliable con'ralnnds, who say that tho Con
federacy is caving In they are all, every on) of
them, to use a Turkish expression of greit forco,
Iiish! essential humbug, of which wo have
had more tiiau enough for four long ycari.
The war Is on our hands, and we must fight it
out, and accept all the attondant diilleulties of
the situation. Like nil disagreeable dutios, wo
should perform it ns quick!;' as possible ; and if
oou,?"0 more men and tenhundred more minimis
will not do tho Work up by next midsummer, io
the nnmc of all reason and common sense let us
double both the men and tho money, and tin
suinmale the business promptly and thoroughly.
We shall then have amp'e ability to return to a
sound financial bacis, in what the soldiers call "a
double; quick ;" and we shall 6ive time, save
credit, and ltd a proud iatislaclioiiln having done:
our duty nobly, like men who ha0 au earnest
love of countiy, which no impediments can cn-
ijiicr no disaster dismay to whom inop assibili
tiis are unknown, aud tlie glovy of success is
assured.
Another oil compwy that we cau reom
mend has been added to the list, called tha
Comt! onwealtU tlil Company, of Lawrence
county, Pennsylvania! Notwithstanding the
actual value cf the property of this Company,
it represents a cupital of only two hundred
thousand dollars, divided in o shares of $l-M
each, the subscription price at present for which
is only Sl id each, the territory of the Com
pany Is thirty-live ucres, In fee simple, on Slip
pery Hock creek, Lawrence county, Fa., aud
is part of the famous " Matthew Stewart'
oil tract, und adjoins the ' Phillips Well." Tho
results thus finr obtained In b iriug arc hig'ily
satisfactory, tho existence of vast deposits cf oil
nt a moderate depth being established. There is
Also an abundance of Coal of the test quality on
the projierty, to furnish fuel for steam engine',
and ilcb veins of iron ore have been developed.
sVlr,(iOn unpaid capital has been reserved by the
company. Samples of the oil, c .il, and iron from
this tiuct can be seen at the oilice, No. Hi Ches
nut street, where subscriptions arc received.
Tie market this morning is quite steady, with
a fair ihmand for shares of all kinds the public
feeling more assured of the future, and since the
Gold bill in the House has been tabled by a de
cisive vote, it Is hoped that the currency tinkers
will abstuin from further rash experiments. The
, Aiw York market le much li.-mer than yesterday
DECEMBER 8, 1864.
and prices nro more steady. The m arl.ct In Read
ing, which is our leading dividend-paying fancy
t oek, Is steady at KKJ.
The Oil shares arc dull, bnt thorn Is a strong
Bndcrtow, which leads ns to look for a rally In
those that have been most hammered down. If
the directors will only put the merits of their
rceivcctlvc properties fairly before the public in
the journals, the reilly meritorious will advance
In price, and ihe bogus ones will die a naturtl
death suddenly, with no hope of resurrection
hereafter.
Government hondi are In demand, bnt prices
are rather lower, with sales of 6 20. at lfHJ;
10 4ds at H 1.1 ; nnd f.s of ISS1 st 109 1, coupons

Railroad shares combine dull but steady, with
Sab s of Reading at OS1., an adv ance of j ; 4 was
bid for Little Schuylkill; 30 for North Penn
sylvania ; .11 for Klaiiia preferred ; and 37 for
Catswissa preferred.
In City Passenger Railroad shares there is
little or nothing doing. i;4 was bid far Wes
Philadelphia; I'iJ for Arch; 2) for Green and
Coatcs ; (ill nas fttiked for Second and Third ; and
for Tenth and Eleventh.
Hank shares are firmly held, but we hoar of no

Farmers' and Mechanics', old stock.
Canal share have advanced. Schuylkill Navi
gation preferred sold ut ,T.'.i.'i:ti, an a I va me of
.J; :n was bid for Schnylkdl Navigitlon common.
Oil Hocks continue dull, and prices are unset
tled, sales of Caldwell at 6; Mineral at 2J ; Mc
Clintock at 'iil ; Pvrry at 4 : Deusmore at S.J ; aud
011 Creek at xii.
There 1- no change to notice In the M inev Mar
ket. Loans on call are freely offurcd at 5;rfi; per
Cent, per annnm. Trimc paper is scarco aud
quoted at 9 per cent.
Gold continues excited, and prices have ad
vanced alioiit 3 percent, since last evening, open

fill oil and sold at 211 at 12; rallied and sold ut

Got dSaLiis. Tkkasi 11Y Kiif AnTMENT, Office
ok Imiiisai. Rbvunti., Washington, Decem
ber II, lHtil. Sir : Your letter of November 2i,
upon the ground that they sell on their own
account, has bcon received.
Ah I understand the ease those sales aro merely
speculative, the vender Is not the owner of th'i
gold be oilers, nor has he it in his possession, and
iu fact none is delivered, hut the transaction is
completed by the payment of difference.
The proviso to section U7 provides for an addi
tion ot .'itipcr cent, to tho regular tax, in the case
win re any person not licensed as provided Bhall
sell or oiler to sell gold, (vc, not lumci Vc at the
time bis own property, and actually on hand ; in
audition to all other penalties, one of which
would be for doing business without a license,
Vnder this proviso, eny person selling gold not
bona We at the time his own property aud actu
ally on land, is deemed to be doiug tue easiness
of a broker.
If he has a license as such, he is liable to thtj
tax of onc-twentieth of one per cent.
It he has no license, ho is liable to the petiUy
und lor the nddi ional fifty per cent, on '.qo'ux '
If such party sells gold which isA.i,, jji,
own piopi riy at tho tune and actually ou hand
he is not liable to the tax.
