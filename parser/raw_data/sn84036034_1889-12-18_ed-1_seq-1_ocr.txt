How Denver Was Cursed With

THE WORKINGS OF DISHONEST OFFICERS.
They Garrotte Under Cover of

A Story of tha Qneen City of tho PUlna
Meöormott Hotel and
Caught on tho Ply by a
"Minor" Reporter.
Prom Sundays Daily.
Sitting in tho office of the McDermott a
few evenings ago was a party of gentlemen
who had formed a casual acquaintance
with each other, as travelers very often do
whet finding themselves in a strange place
and with no companions to while away the
time. The little knot of men represented
the tour points of the globe, and after a
short time spent in deeultory conversa
tion, they finally began telling stories and
reminiscences. One of the gentleman, a
tall, athletic looking man, with hair
slightly besprinkled with gray, after knock
ing the ashes from hie cigar, swung himself
into a more easy position in hie chair and
apparently prepared himself to tell a
good, long story. ▲ Minks reporter who
wae sitting close by, moved a little nearer
to the party and occasionally jotted down
notes as the narrator proceeded with his
story, and as it proved so highly interest
ing to himself he came to the conclusion
that it might possess an wqual amount of
interest to others. Following is the gentle
man's story:
"The recent conviction of James and
Charles Connor at Denver, for a conspiracy
to rob a Rio Grande express train last
April, marks the complete downfall and
utter collapse of one of the most powerful
and unscrupulous gangs that ever ruled an
American municipality. Coder the ad
ministration of William Scott Lee, the pre
decessor of Mayor Londoner, the corrup
tion of the municipal affairs of Denver
rivalled the palmiest days of the Tweed
ring in New York, and though their opera
tions were not so extensive, the reason was
on account of the absence of opportunities
and the presence of a more limited field of
operations.
"James Connor, now serving a two
years' sentence on the charge mentioned
above, was for two years second lieutenant
of police under Chief Heory Brady, while
Charle Charles Connor, convicted on a sim
ilar count, held a position of responsibility
on the eity detective force. During the
last year of Brady's incumbency a bold job
of political piracy, perpetrated to retain
Republican ascency and gang dominance
of Denver's city government, aroused the
ire of the Rocky Mountoin News, which
delegated one of its oldest reporters to
investigate the police department and ex
poee its rascalities to the world. That re
K rter, who is now no longer a resident of
nver, carried out the instructions given
him and succeeded in establishing indubit
able proof that the heads of the police
force were not only in league with the
boldest and shrewdest criminals of
Chicago' and KanBae City to rob the cit
itizens and merchants of Denver, but also
discovered and substantiated the. asser
tion that prisoners In the city jail were
being robbed of their money, which was
divided between the police officials. Their
method was oiiginal and eminently suc
cessful, and for a long time yielded the
officials a revenue estimated at between
$12,000 and $18,000 per year from this
and other sources that I will explain
further on, Strangers in the city were
usually selected as victims, but this bold,
unscrupulous gang did not hesitate, if op
portunity presented, to rob their fellow
citisens. But a stranger found on Hal.i
day street, in a partial or maudlin state
of intoxication, 9 would be placed
under arrest and conveyed to
the eitv jail. Here.
being Incarcerated, the ordinance requires
that all prisoners had to be searched for
money and,other valuables, which were to
be properly listed and given in charge of
the jailor, in whose custoiy they were sup
posed to remain until the prisoner was re
leased. To the lasting credit of Jailors
Hugh Smith, Bart Sullivan and "Fatty"
Fowler, it must be said they had noth!og
to do with, and knew little, if anything of
the infamou* scheme which I will detail.
Supposing the prisoner to be under the in
fluence of liquor aud admitting that he
had a considerable sum of money on his
person, the sergeant, instead of removing
the money would conduct a blind search
and leave it in 1 he prisoner's pocket. The
record of the jailor's record would show
"Money and eflects, none? The drunken
and unsuspecting victim would then be
thrown into the bull pen with half a hun
dred filthy trampe, among whom the police
would have several trustys held there for
«he purpose, who would rob the prisoner of
bis money and turn it over to the police offi
cials. Of course the prisoner, when arraign
ed for trial the following morning, would
made a vigorous kick, and, conscious of
having been robbed in the jail, ""k 4 ® 4 * 1 * 4
when taken into custody he had $200 or
$200 or whatever the amount might have
been. The sergeant, jailer and officers who
made the arrest would corroborate the
lieutenant's statement that the prisoner
had no money, or if he bad that he must
have spent or lost it among the ^ons«« of
Hollidav street. That would satisfy the
court, cunningly devised stories imposed

next morning, and that would set

r Food, a red-faced plug ugly
tro i Omaha, 'nil a bartender in a crooked
joii.t in Denver at the time, saved his
bacon by timely flight. He thus escaped
the penalty visited upon his co-conepira
tors.
The News and Republican finally joined
hands to down the police gang, who, with
out taking heed of impending disaster, in
vited their doom by subverting the ballot
wad fraudulently reverging an adverse de
ore® rendered against them at tbs city elec
tion. This aroused the cltixens to fury,
and indignation meetings of tbs most
stormy charaotor were held to denounce
the conspirators. The pressure brought to
beer npon Mayor Londoner became so
great that he found it impossible to
retain Brady and Connor npon the police
foroe and they were dismissed. Shorn of
authority and power, they became objects
of public contumely, and finally began to
associate publicly with the most notorious
criminals, each as Jim Marshall, "Little
Horace" Hoven, Mnnson and others.
These associations culminated in a plan
to rob a Rio Grande express train in the
gloomy recesses of the Black canyon, near
Melrose, Cdlo. Joe Ward, as he was known
to the gang, but whose real name is Samuel
Holliday, is a famous detective in the em-
ploy of Thiel's agency. The new chief of
police, John F. Farley, who had prior to
his appointment been manager of Thiel's
----- - tfc, „w of
concocting a criminal job, and sending for
.....ofMar-
Ward, had him camp on the trail
shall, Connor and their associates,
Ward,
by shrewd tactics, gained the confidence of
Marshall at the latter's saloon, on Sixth
and Broadway streets in Kansas C3ty, and
hi« apparent crookedness so impressed
Marshall that he informed'Ward' of the
plan in process of insnbation and gave him
a letter to Connor of Denver, assuring the
latter that the bearer was all right and
one of their kind of people. Thus securely
established in their confidence 'Ward' was
admitted to all their conncils and was
given the combination to all their secrets.
He entered heartily into the proposition to
rob the Rio Grande train and, with Mar
shall, was assigned the task of sniering the
express car, garroting the messenger and
robbing the safe. Of conrs9 'Ward' was in
daily communication with Chief Farley
and General Manager Cramer of the Denver
& Rio Grande Express company, and kept
them thoroughly informed of every move
made by the conspirators. Finally, after
weeks of deliberation in the formation of
detailed plans by which to perpetrate the
crime, all wae arranged and James and
Charles Connor left Denver for Black can
yon for the robbery. They went ahead,
leaving 'Ward' and Marshall to board the
train the following day ahd seizethemoney
' ' ......... ih
in the darkness as the train toiled througi
the canyon. The place designated tor the
robbery had been carefully indicated to
M . Cramer, who had Sheriff Shores and a
posse of men ambushed in elf se proximity
to the spot. While the two Conners were it
Melrose they grew suspicious, and seeing
themselves shadowed by an incautious
sheriff, they abandoned the proposed rob
bery, telegraphed as per instructions to,
Tim Connor at Denver, 'Goods too high
will not take them,' and boarded the first
train for tome.
"With the information gained from
'Ward,' associated with strong circumstan
tial evidence, the express company insti
tuted a criminal action against Marshall
and the two Connors, charging
them with conspiracy to rob an ex
press train. The first trial, which
took plack last June resulted in
a hung jury, which stood seven for con
viction and five for acquittal. It was af
terward learned that the jury had been
packed, and there was so much crooked
work connected with+the triai that it
aroused public indignation to white heat.
The News, for some inscrutable purpose,
made a complete somersault and swung
ai ound to a defense of Connors after the
first trial, while the Republican, irritated
bv the singular attitude of it* great rival,
besame absolutely malevolent, and for
weeks preceding the eecoDd trial the dé
fendante moved in a hostile newspaper
atmosphere, so far as the Republican was
concerned.
"Unfortunately for the Connors and
Marshall, pending the second trial the
county election came off, and by
mighty combination of Democrats
and the better case of Republicans,
almost the entire Republican county ticket,
.. hich represented the Connors' friends,
was defeated by majorities ranging from
600 to 6,000, though the county is usually
2,000 Republican. In the contest, E. R.
Barton, the Democratic candidate for
sheriff, and the identical man, whom the
Connors and Brady had cheated out of the
mayoralty in April, was elected by 3,000
majority. The revolution of public feeling
was so intense that it carried every obsta
cle before it, and cleared the court house of
all the old gang except Joe Smith, the
county clerk, who pulled through by a nar
row margin because the opposition could
not unite on a single candidate and divided
ite strength on two men.
,
"Shortly after the
called, and after detecting the defense in
two attempts to pack the jury,
twelve citizens; good and true,
were impanelled and the trial
began. At the expiration of ten days the
case wae given to the jury, who returned a
verdict of 'guilty' and Judge Decker sen
tenced Jim Connor and Jim Marshall to
two years in prison and $1,000 fine each,
while Charles Connor escaped with one
year and a $600 fine.
"At the close of the trial chargee of per
ju y and bribing a jury were preferred
igaioet two men named Duff and Harrison,
friends of the defendants. Both were con
victed and sentenced to prison.
"An act of almost unpardonable care
lessness on the part ol Chief Brady, *nd»n
incident known only to a few even in Den
ver, led Chief Farley, Brady's successor, to
suspect the old police officials to have been
in collusion with Marshall and other high
class crooks. 8am Inman, who was forced
from his position as first lieutenant under
the old gang because he sturdily refused to
participate in their jobs or •auction
their schemes of robbery, was-the
humble instrument through which
this startling information became known
One day in October, 1888, Inman was left
in charge of the day detail, while Brady,
Connor, Marshall, Williams and others o!
that ilk were iu attendance npon the races
at Overland park. During their absence a
letter, addressed officially to the chief, was
handed Inman as the officer in ch*cge.
Supposing ite content* to be of an official
nature, Inman opened it, and wa*

Tha Chief Contractor of the Union Paeiffc
Makes a Denial.
Omaha, Neb., Dec. 16.—[Special to the
Miner.]—J. 8. Cameron, chief construction
manager of the Unioa Pacific, says that
there ie absolutely no troth in the reports
that hie company proposes to extend ite
Utah Central line into San Francisco.
"I would not take the trouble to deny
the stories, bat they are giving ns some
annoyance and ought to be stopped. The
California newspapers have been saying so
much about the Union Pacific's move
ments that our connections ont there, the
Southern Pacific especially, begins to think
we are lying to them. We have never had
any intention of building the Utah Central
beyend Los Angeles. There ie just this
about the situation, that great stretch of
country ie becoming too important to be
overlooked very mach longer. The tact
was becoming more evident everyday that
some one would go in there and build a
road through it. We think that the
Union Pacific could better afford to take
the lead than let some outfit which would
build merely to sell out get it. It has been
difficult matter for ue to make the
Southern Pacific people understand our
position. Since it has become known that
Chief Engineer Bogus proposes to locate
his family in San Francisco and live there
every person interested naturally concluded
that the company intended to eventually
construct ite line to that cify. This move,
however, on the part of Mr. Bogne, de
clares Mr. Camt-rpn, has no each signifi
cance attached to it. The latter ha* just
returned from Salt Lake, and predicts that
the next twelve months will witness in Utah
repetition of the excitement in rail
road building had in Colorado ten
years ago.
Barrett Operated Upon.
Boston, Dec. 16.—A surgical operation
was performed upon Lawrence Barrett
this -morning consisting of a removal of
some lymphatic glands of tbs throat. As
soon as the patient is convalseent he will

European watering place for test and re
cuperation.
A Cold-Blooded Murder.
Spokane Falls, Dec. 16.—[Special to
the Miner.]—Thomas Clyck, a f irmer, was
shot and killed at 9 o'clock this morning
in front of the city ball at Colfax, where
the superior court was in session, by Ben
Blanton. Clyck and two friends, Donnell
and Doble, were walking along the street.
As thev passe! the door of city ball Blan
ton stepped out and began firing. Clyck
fell at the first shot. He then emptied bis
revolver at the other two men, not hitting
either of them. Blanton is a notoriouf
character and bad man, having killed a
man in Oregon, and has been in the Oregon
penitentiary. All three men were prose
cuting witnesses in an assault case now
being triid against Doble. Clyck is a resi
dent of Whitman county, a well respected
citizen and leaves a wile and family. Pub
lie indignation runs high, and there is a
strong probability of lynching.
A Maniac's Deed.
New Yoke, Dec. 16.—Joseph Krackd, a
Bohemian carpenter, became insane to

story window. He said he saw Jesus in
the yard and threw hie children to him as

Los Angeles, Cal., Dec. 16.— The trains

It is reported that the train from the north
due here yesterday morning went into a
washout at Lang's and two Pullman cars

Connell has just announced from the bench
that no verdict has been reached by the
Cronin jury and that he wonld not be in
attendance again untill 2 p. m.
A significant fact in connection with the
impossibilities of a speedy verdiet is that
another room has been fitted np down
stairs for the grand jury and that the
Cronin jury still occupies the grand jury
rooms. The morning papers published all
sorts of wild and wooly yarns in regard to
the case. One, in an extra, declared the
verdict had been reached and pretended to
give the penalty in each case. Another
gave a long circumstantial account ol how
Jnror Culver was assaulted by an infur
iated member of the jury because be refused
to agree with the other eleven, and that
Culver sent notice to Judge McConnell de
manding protection and that MeConnsll
replied that he would have to look alter
himself. The absurdity of this is self
evident from the fact that Judge McConnell
said to an Associated Press reporter yes
terday that anything like coercion would
justify the discharge of the jury.
When Judge McConnell sent a messenger
to the bailiff in charge of the jury to inquire
whether the "jury had any communication
to make to the court, an answer came
back promptly. The jury was not pre
pared to '.ake action and had no commu
nication whatever to make to the court.
Thus all reports of the jury having agreed
upon a verdict were found as utterly ground
less as the hundreds that proceeded them.
It is now utterly impossible to get any
information of any character before 2 p.
Judge McConnell, in an interview with
an Associated Press reporter this mot ning,
deprecated any publication of wild specu
lation by the papers, and denied that any
assault on Juror Culver had taken place as
published. The matter would have been
reported to him and it would meet with
prompt punishment. The statement that
Culver had appealed to him for protection
was absolutely false. He added that it
was going too far to suppose the jury un
able to agree as it had not intimated any
eueh thing to the c >urt.
Wind a Verdict. -
2 p. m.—The attorneys for both sides
have been notified by .the judge that a ver
dict has been reached and their attendance
at the court desired. Sheriff Matson has
just despatched the bailiffs to conduct the
defendants into the court room. Some
trouble is experienced in finding all the at
torneys for the defense, and a delay will
probably reenlt.
2:25 p. m.—The attorneys have arrived
aud the prisoners are being brought in.
The court has just been called to order.
The verdict of the jury is as follows:
We, the jury, find defendant John F.
Beggs not guilty. We, the jury, find de
fendant John Kunze guilty of manslaughter,
as charged in the indictment, and fix the
punishment an imprisonment in the peni
tentiary for a term of throe yean. We,
the jury, find defendants Daniel Cooghlin,
Patrick O'Sullivan end Martin Burke
guilty of murder in the manner and form
as charged in the indictment and fix the
penalty at imprisonment in the peniten

The Effect oa the Prisoners.
At the request of the defense the jury
as then polled and reaffirmed the verdict.
Simultaneous with the announcement of
the verdict Coughlin, O'Sullivan and Burke
turned deathly pale while Kunze started
suddenly from his seat and a moment later
dropped his head upon hie breast and
barst into tears.
Beggs' face wae luminous with joy and
immediately after the l ohing of the jury
be arose from amidst the prisoners, walked
to the jury box and daring the
breathless moments that followed shook
Foreman Clark's hand heartily and said,
Gentlemen, I thank you. I trust the future
may confirm your judgment upon me, and
that you will never regret that you found
me not guilty of this terrible charge."
Thdbuly sound that broke theetillneee fol
lowing this wae the deep sobs of little
Kunze. He burst out with"God knows I
am innocent. I never wae in Lakeview
that night. Oh, God knows I am innocent,
gentlemen." O'Sullivan wae the only one
of the other three prisoners who found a
refuge in tears. For a moment they trick
led down hie cheeks but a minute later his
black eyes flashed with defiance or revival
of courage, aod, dashing his band across
his brow, he braced np in his eeat and cast
long glances around the court room. The
only evidence ol terror to be perceived in
Conghlin wae an increased pallor over
spread his face, as he folly realized the sig
nificance of the sentence to imprisonment
for life, and hie lips twitched nervously
during the colloquy that followed between
hie attorney and the court relative to the
motion for a new trial. Martin Burke un
questionably was least affected of all the
prisoners. His usually florid face took on
a slight pallor as the verdict was an'
nounced, but a moment later bis jaws be
gan a methodical mastication of gum as
regularly as at any previous time during
the trial.
As the verdict was announced and the
large audience contemplated little Kunze'e
grief, Beggs turned to a reporter and said
It's a shame to sentence Kanse, The
poor little fellow I think is as innocent ae
I am. It's a —n shame to send him to the
penitentiary lor throe years. He had no
more idea of being foand guilty than you

Comments on the Verdict.
Ths comments among the audience were
varions. Bo?h the Irish factions were well
represented and naturally took opposite
views. Cronin's friends were indignant at
the verdict. "It is a shame" said Hon. P,
W. Dunn, "a shame and travesty upon
justice." Hie sentiments found echo from
a dozen Irishmen near him. While only
dozen feet away the members ol the other
faction wer congratulating themselves and
prisoners that the verdict was no worse,
and the friends of B*gga weroelbowing their
way through to him, grasped the hands of
ths senior guardian of Camp 20 in felicitar
tion npon his exoneration.
Forest, on behalf of the four convicted
defendants entered the accustomed motion
fora new trial. After considerable dis
cussion the judge filed Jan. 13 as the day
on which the motion tor a new trial will be
argued and the prisoners were taken back
to jail. Kunze, still crying, went ont of the

"Judicially, of course, I can pass no

however, and without being cognisant of
all the proceedings in the jury room, I
might say, I think the verdict is the result
ot the objection of some of the jurors to
the death penalty on circumstantial evi
dence."
Mr. Culver, probably." "No, not Mr.
Cnlver, necessarily. I understand he was
in favor ot an acquittal from ths start. It
was only after a long and harassing de
liberation that he originally agreed with
the rest npon this verdict. You will prob
ably find Mr. Culver was not the only man
upon the jury who was opposed to the
hanging of the three principal defendants."
But the jurors all swore on being ex
amined as to their competence, that they
had no conscientious scruples against
capital punishment on circumstantial evi
dence."
That is all true, but behind all this
each man had a mental reservation that
the evidence most be convincing beyond a
reasonable doubt. Now, if some of theee
men should think there was even the faint
est shadowy as to the guilt of these three
men, do you not see how natural it would
be for them to easily compromise the mat
ter with their conscience, no matter bow
conclusive their judgment might be, by fa
voring life imprisonment in lieu of the
death penalty? AH because the case was
oue of circumstantial evidence."
I believe you feel relieved tbat then has
not been a disagreement?"
"I do, most assuredly. Although if the
jury had disagreed and it became necessary
to try the caee again, I should not have
fl nc'ied from presiding over the same case
again." _
Interviewing the Prisoners.
About 4 o'clock an Associated Press
representative went to t he jail and found the
four convicted defendants out in the cor
dor with the other inmates taking the
usual exercise before supper.
Kunse seemed to hold himself apart from
the other prisoners and remained in his
cell, refusing to be comforted in his mis
fortune.
Coughlin and 0'SulHvan were at tho en
trance of the cage, diecuBsing the case with
couple of members of Camp 20 who had
called to offer their sympathy—or con
gratulation, who knows which.
At the approach of the prees representa
tive« they quic ly lapsed into eilenee and
the visitors departed. A note was subse
jiently sent to Coughlin and bis com
panion, requesting an interview, and they
infilly approached the cage.
'I am Borrv to disappoint you" said
Coughlin very courteously, "but I do not
desire to be interviewed."
"But what is your opinion of the ver
dict?"
"I am afraid I eh nil have to refer you to
Mr. Forrest, my attorney for an answer to
that question."
"Are you disappointed at the verdict?"
"Well, I suppose do man regards thejver
dict of life imprisonment with aDy par
ticular enthusiaem," said the ex-detective
grimly, "but really, gentlemen, I must de
cline to be interviewed."
With this sentence Coughlin retired, pleas
antly bowing good evening as he went. It
was evident to all that the prisoner was in
mood very nearly elation and to Dan
Coughlin, at least the veidict was the
source of self congratulation. His habitual
mood during the confinement the past six
months has been one of taciturnity, but
this evening a bright smile illumined his
face and his step was light and buoyant.
In the boys' department Martin Burke
was found walking up and down smoking a
cigar. He seemed entirely composed and
;ood natured as be greeted the Associated
Press reporter.
Well, Burke, what do you think of it?"
Oh, I am not saying a word," said the
young Irishman.
"The Chicago papers have had enough to
say about me already, and I don't want to
gi ve them any excuse for any more."
"But you dou't include us in your gen
ei al damnation?"
I'm not damning the papers," said
Burke, "I've nothing against them, but
guess they can get aloDg without me."
All efforts to extract any comments from
Burke on the verdict were vain. He ex
pressed himself ae being delighted to con
verse on what he termed "social topics,"
but on this "other business," as he called
it, with a jerk of his head towards the
court room, be was as dumb as an oyster.
A Sad Incident,
When the verdict was road this afternoon
Dan Coughlin's wife and little girl were sit
ting out in the main corridor of the crimi
nal court building. Some one rushed into
the corridor and announced the result.
Mrs. Coughlin gasped, stood erect, shrieked
and tell back into thechair. She buried her
face in her hands and moaned wildly. The
child, too, began to cry loudly. Mrs.
Whalen, O'Sullivan's sister-in-law, was
standing by and turned roughly upon the
men who were watching Mrs. Coughlin.
Oh, you cut-throats, you tried your beet
to hang them, and now you bang around
to gloat at us in our misery." Sbeshouted
and then followed Mrs. Coughlin into tbs
private room.
Driven to Desperation.
St. Joseph, Mo., Dec. 16.—Julias Hooper
was to-day shot and killed by Louise Ep
person, near Bakereville. Hooper for some
time has been teasing Miss Epperson about
her admirers, and had driven her nearly
frantic. To-day at the dinner table he
commenced joking again when the girl left
the room, got a revolver, came back and
witkout a word shot Hooper in the head.
Culver Won't Talk.
John Culver was at his home at Evans
ton this euening and refused to make any
statement ag to what took place in the
the jury room, or whether or n >t he was
the dissenting member. AH he would eay
was: "I took wbat to me was the only
just course." Mr. Culver warmly denied
the stories of quarrels among the jurors.
Boses a Free Man.
John F. Beggs left the jail this afternoon
soon after court adjourned in company
with his lawyers and friends. As he stepped
into the street a free man, Beggs was heard
to say: "I am (O'BK to spend the rest of
my life hunting down the men who killed
Cronin." Bens spent a few mi antes at bis
office and then harried home, where be pos
itively refused to receive callers this even
ing. _

THEY TAKE THE OATH.
Democratic Senators Sworn In
By Chief Justice Blake.
THE SENATE NOT YET ORGANIZED.
Democrats of the Senate Will
Stand By Their Rights.
The Senate Chamber Tilled With Racer
and Attentive Spectator*—The House
of Representative* Sends n Reso
lution to Its Absent Members.
From Tneadar* Daily.
Helena,' Dec. 16.—[Special to the
Mipcr.]—When the senate met this morn
ing a large number of the leading politicians
were present on the floor of the senate
chamber, and the galleries were filled with
eager and attentive spectators.
Roll call was answered to by fifteen mem
bers, Lawrence A. Brown ot Beaverhead
alone being absent, and be came in a few
minutes later.
Lieutenant-Governor Ricards then made
the paradoxical announcement that the
absent senators were present, and on in
quiring if they were ready t > take the oath
was answered in the affirmative.
He then appointed Senators Hedges and
Parberry-a committee to waits upon Chief
Justice Blake and escort him to the senate
ch mber.
On his arrival all the Democratic sena
tors stood up and took the oath of office.
A recess of fifteen minutes was then taken
while the written oaths were being pre
pared. When the senate was again called
to order the chief justice announced that
all the senators had signed the written
oaths, which would be placed on file with
the secretary of state.
No further business was attempted, and
the senate adjourned to 10 o'clock to
morrow.
While this action of the Democratic sen
ators is a step in the right direction, it
does not end the deadlock. Yonr corres
pondent hss it on good authority that no
organization of the senate will be perfected
until the Democrats are assured of their
rights. They ask no more than* this, but
they will never yield a single point from
the stand they took in the beginning.
In the House.
In the honee this morning Mr. Comly in
troduced the following resolution, which
after being road, was adopted on motion of
Mr. Courtney:
Whereas, This house of representatives
ot the State of Montana, holding its ses
sions in the hall of the house ot reproeenti
tives in the court house at Helena, Mont.,

Chief Clerk. Speaker
At the afternoon session the eergeant-at
arms reported tbat he had delivered copies
of the above resolutions to fifteen of the
absent members—all he had been able to
find, and none of whom had reported to
the house. He was ordered to report
again at 10 o'clock to-morrow, to which
hour the house adjourned.
If the Republican members refuse to re
port at the place designated, some decisive
action may be looked for within the next
three days, though the nature of such
action is not known outside of party
councils.
Ths talk is that (he rumpers will consent
to come in on the basis of leaving out all
the Silver Bow delegation whose seats are
in dispute until their claims can be settled
by investigation.
The house of representatives will not
entertain this proposition for a moment.
It will not recede a step from the position
taken on the 23d day of November, and all
its members who come in must do sounder
the conditions of Gov. Toole's proclama
tion.
SATURDAY'S DOINGS AT HELENA
Neither the House or the Rump Meet—The
Senate Has a Prayer and Adjourn.
From Sundays Daily.
Helena, Dec. 14.— [8pecial to the
Miner.]—Unless all signs fail, next week
will be an eventful one in the history of
Mont ma. The political situation is rap
idly approaching a crisis, and while both
sides are extremely reticent as to future
plans, there is no longer any doubt
tbat the Democratic eenators-elect will
enter the senate chamber on Monday at 10
o'elock and take the oath of office.
While this action on the part of the
Democrat* will not necessarily end the
deadlock, it will simplify matters, and may
bring about a settlement of the unfortu
nate state of affaire that now exist.
[t was this view of the case, and a pa
triotic desire to end the difficulty by any
fair and honorable means, that induced
ths Democratic members to consent to an
prganization of the senate under existing
circumstances. What steps will betaken
is a matter of conjecture, but the people
can rest assured that their interests lie in
the bande of able, honest and intelligent
men, and that no compromise will be
m ids tbat will ran counter to the'r wishes
M expressed at the polls on the first day of
last October. _
Among the Legislators.
Neither the house of repreeentativee nor
the rump held seeeione to-day, most of the
members being out of town on a visit to
their homes.
State Treasurer Hickman has been ab
sent a week. He Is expected to return in a
dar or two with his family, who will in fu
ture reside at the capital.
The senate met at ,10 a. m., and after
prayer by the chaplain and reading of
the minutes it adjourned to 10 o'clock on
Monday. _

TALKING FOR MONTANA.
Senator Vest of Missouri Wants to Why
Montana is Left Out in Classification.
of
an
in
be
W A9HINOTON , Djc. 12.—[Special curr
epoudence of the Miner.]—Before the Fifty
first congress wae one hour old the fact
was developed that Montana has a cham
pion in the senate, and a champion who is
well able to fight her battles—a champion
whose keen tongue and merciless bluntness
of speech has more than once lashed the
politicians and demagogues on the Repub
lican aide of the chamber—I mean honest,
blunt old Senator Vest of Missouri. Until
Montana sends two staunch Democratic
senators, and that is whst is looked for
down here, Senator Vest will keep one eye
on Missouri's and occasionally both on
Montana's interests here.
The occurrence alluded to happened on
Monday. Senator Hoar had introduced
resolution providing for the classification
of the terms ot office of senators from
North and South Dakota and Washington.
Senator Vest listened awhile and then
asked if there was anything in the resolu
tion in regard to Montana.
"Nothing, replied Senator Hoar. I do
not understand tbat the senators from
Montana are here or are likely to be here
very soon."
''That is very true," said Senator Vest,
"yet I would suggest that provisions be
made tor an event which is sure to happen
and which we know must happen in refer
ence to a state that is already a member ol
the union by the president's proclamation,
But, of course, that matter can be consid
ered by the committee on privileges and
elections."
"The senators from Montana will lose
nothing by not being included in the reso
lotion," said Senator Hoar.
No, 1 shall see that they lose nothing,
replied Vest, with a threatening shake o!
his head.
There is every indication that the Re
publicans are not «oing to have such a
walk-over in congress as they may have
imagined at the November elections, ihey
have a bare majority of eight, and it is
almost impossible to keep a majority in
the house all the time. The Democrats are
alert, watchful an don hand at the call o
their leaders, ready to vote eolidly with
each other. With Carlisle, Randall, Mills
and Breckenridge at their head they are
going to present a formidable front to the
slim Republican majority. Party dissen
sions are rife among the Republicans
already, although they are trying hard to
conceal it. In the election of house officers
the Republican caucus had selected a radi
cal named Ramsdell to be chaplain. When
the vote came some of the Republicans
bolted the caucus choice and elected a
Democrat!
Major Powell,chief of the geological survey
has made an inteiesting report to the sec
retary of the interior upon surveys for
irrigation in Montana. During t he slimmer
I he department had three parties in the
field and they surveyed 580 square miles
around Yellowstone lake. Mucli valuable
information of a general nature as to the
country w as secured and Mr. Wilson, the
engineer in charge has secured data for the
segregation of about eleven million acres
of irrigable land, and for the withdrawal of
over sixty reservoir sites. The survey of the
Sun river basin was completed.
Assistant Attorney General Shields of
the interior department has made an in
teresting decision concerning pre-emption
lands in Montana. He has given an
opinion as to the eeventeenth section of
the act admitting the new states which re
fers to the act of 1841 the original pre
emption act, and repeals the same as to
the new states. He holds that the intent
wae not to repeal the pre-emption laws but
to make a grant oi land's in lien ot the
eighth section of 1841, generally known ae
the interior improvement grant and to re
peal that section ae to the new statee.
The following Montana postmasters have
been appointed: H. W. Cosier, Popular
Creek agency; Jene Jensen, Woodville;
Chariee Miles, Laurel; Mro. C. B. Scribner
Rurnoey.
The Démocrate here are anxiously look
ing to Montana for two Democratic
senators.

the agricultural report for 1889 passed
with amendments fixing the number of
copies at 400,000 and appropriating
$200,000 for the cost.
Among the bills reported from the com
mittees and placed on the calendar was one

tablishment of a gun factory for finishing

pension. By Manderson, for woman • suf
frage in all the states. Mitchell offered a
resolution, which was agreed to, instruct

report whether the Chinese laborers who
have never been in the United States or
who, "having been here," bave left the
country, may under the existing legis
lation be permitted to enther the United
States for the sole purpose of transmit
across the same, either with or without
authority from the secretary of the treas

Iowa, directing the committee on elections
to inquire into the contested election case
of Clayton against Breckenridge of Arkan
sas, Clayton bavin? been assassinated
while preparing his case.
Breckenridge of Arkansas said it had
been his intention to offer a resolution the
same in import, but since the adjoprnment
ol the last congress proceedings had been
taken in the United States court iu his
state, relating to the matters of current re
port fn the district he represented. Inas
much as those proceedings seemed to him
to be conclusive, and as f lit court was one
not organized by bis party or members of
his party but was throughout its whole or
ganization a republican court, it had ap
peared to him that the proprieties of the
caee demandtd tbat that the initiative
should be taken by the other side. As it
had been he trusted the proper disposition
would be made of the resolution and the
action of the committee on elections would
be such as to give the amplest range of in
quiry that was proper under the jurisdic
tion of the bouse.
Crisp contended thatthe resolution must
go to the committee on elections, but he
was overruled and the resolution adopted.
The house then adjourned.
