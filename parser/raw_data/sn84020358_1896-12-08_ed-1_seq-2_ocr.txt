Government Hai Suggested to Spain A

Interfere Our Interest In the Turkish
Outrages The Venezuelan Treaty Con

Currency A Final Plea for Economy.
Washington, Dec. 7. The president
to-day transmitted to congress the fol
lowing; message:
To the Congress (of the United States:
As representatives of the people in the
legislative branch of their government,
you have assembled at a time when the
streng-th and excellence of our free in
stiutions, and the fitness of our citi
zens to enjoy popular rule have been
again made manifest. A political con
test involving momentous consequences,
fraught 'with feverish apprehension and
creating aggressiveness so intense as to
approach bitterness and passion, has
been waged throughout our land, and
determined by the decree of free and
independent suffrage, without 'disturb
ance of our tranquility, or the least sign
of weakness, in our national structure.
When we consider these incidents and
contemplate the peaceful obedience and
manly submission which have succeed
ed a heated clash of political opinions,
we discover abundant evidence of a de
termination on the part of our country
men to abide by every verdict of the
popular will, and to be controlled at
all times by an abiding faith in the
agencies established for the direction
of the affairs of their government. Thus
our people exhibit a patriotic disposi
tion which entitles them to demand of
those who undertake to make and exe
cute their laws such faithful and unsel
fish service in their behalf as can only
be prompted by a serious appreciation
of the trust and confidence which the
acceptance of public duty Invites.
THE SITUATION IN TURKEY.
At the outset of a reference to the
more Important maters affecting our re
lations with foreign powers, it would
afford me satisfaction if I could assure
the congress that the disturbed condi
tion in Asiatic Turkey had during the
past year assumed a less hideous and
bloody aspect, and that either as a con
sequence of the awakening of the Turk
ish government to the demands of hu
mane civilization, or as the result of
decisive action on the part of the great
nations having the right by treaty to
interfere for the protection of those
exposed to the rage of mad bigotry and
cruel fanaticism, the shocking features
of the situation had been mitigated.
Instead, however, of welcoming a soft
ened disposition or protective inter
vention, we have been afflicted by con
tinued and not unfrequent reports of
the wanton destruction of homes and
the bloody butchery of men, women and
children, made martyrs to their pro
fession of Christian fatih.. . . :.
While none of our citizens inTurkey
have thus far been killed or wounded,
though often In the midst of dreadful
scenes of danger, their safety in the
future i3 by no means assured. Our
government at home and our minister
at Constantinople : have left nothing
undone to protect our missionaries in
Ottoman territory, who , constitute
nearly all the Individuals residing there
who have a' right o claim our protec
tion on the score of American citizen
ship. Our efforts in this direction will
not be relaxed. But the deep feeling
and sympathy .that have been aroused
among our people ought not to so far
blind their reason and judgment as to
lead them to demand impossible things.
The outbreaks of blind fury which lead
to murder and pillage In Turkey occur
suddenly and without notice, and an at
tempt on our part to force such hostile
presence, those as might be effective
for prevention or protection, would not
only be resisted by the Ottoman gov
ernment, but would be regarded as an
interruption of their plans by the great
nations who assert heir exclusive right
to intervene in their own time and
method for the security of life and
property in Turkey. Several naval ves
sels are stationed in the Mediterranean
as a measure of caution, and to furnish
all possible retief and refuge in case of
emergency. We have made claims
against the Turkish government for the
pillage and destruction of missionary
property at Harpoot and Marash dur
ing uprisings at those places. Thus
far the validity of these demands has
noti been admitted, though our minis
ter, prior to such outrages and In an
ticipation of damage, demanded protec
tion for the persons and property of
our missionary citizens In the locali
ties mentioned, and notwithstanding
that strong evidence exists of actual
complicity of Turkish soldiers in the
works of destruction and robbery, the
facts as they now appear do not permit
us to doubt the Justice of these claims,
and nothing will be omitted to bring
about their prompt settlement.
- A number of Armenian refugees hav
ing arrived at our ports, an order has
lately been obtained from the Turkish
government permitting the wives and
children of such refugees to join them
here. It Is hoped that hereafter no ob
stacle will be interposed to prevent the
escape of all those who seek to aviod
the perils which threaten them in Turk
ish dominions.
Our recently appointed consul tQ Er
zerum Is at his post and discharging
the duties of his office, though for some
unaccountable reason his formal exe
quatur from the Sultan has not been
issued. I do not believe that the pres
ent sombre prospect in Turkey will be
long permited to offend the sight of
Christendom. It so mars the humane
and enlightened civilization that be
longs to the close of the nineteenth

THE CUBAN STRUGGLE.
The insurrection in Cuba still con
tinues with all perplexities. It is dif
ficult to perceive that any progress has
thus far been made- towards the pacifi
cation of the island or that the situa
tion of affairs as depicted in. my last
annual message has in the least Ira.
proved. If Spain still holds Havana
and the seaports And all the considera
ble towns, the insurgents still roam' at
will over at least two thirds of the 'in
land country. If the determination of
Spain to put down the insurrection
seems but to strengthen with, the lapse
of time, and is evinced by her unhesi
taing devotion of 'largely Increased mil
itary and naval forces to the task.there
Is much reason to believe that the In
surgents have gained in point of num
bers, and character, and resources, and
are none .the. less inflexible In their re
solve not to succumb, without practi
cally securing the great object for
which they took up arms. If Spain has
not yet reestablished her authority,
neither have the insurgents made good
their title to be regarded as an inde
pendent state. Indeed, as the contest
has gone on, the pretense that civil
government exists on , the island, ex
cept so far as Spain is liable to main
tain it, has been practically abandon
ed. Spain does keep on foot such a
government, more or less imperfectly,
in the large towns and their immediate
suburbs. But, that exception being
made, the entire country is either given
over to anarchy or is subject to the mil
itary occupation of one or the other
party. It Is reported Indeed on relia
ble authority that at the demand of the
commander-in-chief of the insurgent
army, the putative Cuban government
has now given up attempt to exercise
Its functions, leaving that government
confessedly (what there is the best rea
son for supposing it always1 to have
been In fact) a government merely on
paper. Were the Spanish armies able
to meet their antagonists in the open,
or irr pitched battle, prompt and 'de
cisive results might be looked for, and
the Immense superiority of the Spanish
forces in number.disclplined and equip
ment, could hardly fall to tell greatly
tothelr advantage. But they are called
upon to face a: foo that shuns general
engagements, that can choose and does
choose its own ground, that from the
nature of the country is visible or in
visible at pleasure, and that fights only
from ambuscade, and -when all the ad
vantages of position and numbers are
on its side. In a country where all that
is indispensable to life in the way of
food, clothing and shelter is so easily
obtainable, especially by those born "and
bred on the soil, it is obvious that there
is hardly a limit to the time during
which hostilities of this sort may be
prolonged. Meanwhile, as in all cases
nf protracted civil strife, the passions
of the combatants' grow more and more
inflamed and excesses on both sides be
come more frequent and more deplora
ble. They are also participated in by
bands of marauders, who, now in the
name of one party and now in the name
of the other as: may best suit the oc
casion, harass the country at will and
plunder its wretched inhabitants for
their own advantage. Such a condi
tion of things would inevltalbly entail
immense destruction of property even
If it were the policy of both parties to
prevent it as far as practicable.- But
while such seemed to be the original
policy of the Spanish government, It
has now apparently abandoned it, and
is acting upon the same theory as the
insurgents, namely, that the exigencies
of the contest require the wholesale an
nihilation of property, that it may not
prove of use and advantage to the en
emy. It is to the same end that in pur
suance of general oredrs, Spanish gar
risons are now being withdrawn from
plantations and the rural population re
quires to concentrate itself in the towns.
The sure result w'iuld seem to be that
the industrial value of the Island is fast
diminishing, and that unless ther is a
speedy and radical change in existing
conditions. It will soon disappear alto
gether. The value consists very large
ly, of course, in its capacity to produce
sugar a capacity already much re
duced by the interruption to tillage,
which has taken place during the last
two years. It is reliably asserted that
should these interruptions continue dur
ing the current year and practically ex
tend as is now' threatened to the en
tire sugar producing territory of the
island, so much time and so much mon
ey will be required to restore the land
to its normal productiveness that it is
extremely doubtful if capital can be
inducted to even make the atempt.
The spectacle of the utter ruin of an
adjoining country, by nature one of the
most fertile and charming on the globe,
would engage the serious atention of
the government and people of the Unit
ed States in any circumstances. In
point of fact, they have a concern with
It which is by no menas of a wholly
sentimental or philanthropic character.
It lies so near to us as to be hardly
separated from our territory. Our ac
tual pecuniary interest in it is second
only to that of the people and govern
ment of Spain. It Is reasonably esti
mated that at least from $30,000,000 to
$50,000,000 of American capital are in
vested in plantations and in railroad,
mining, and other business enterprises
on the island. The volume of trade
between the United States and Cuba,
which in 1889 amounted to about $64,
000,000, rose in 1893 to about $103,000,000,
and in 1894, the year before the present
insurrection broke, out, amounted to
nearly $96,000,000. Besides this large pe
cuniary stake in the fortunes of Cuba,
the United States finds itself inextri
cably Involved in the present contest
in other ways both vexatious and cost
ly. Many Cubans reside in this coun
try and indirectly promote the insurrec
tion through the press, by public meet
ings, by the purchase and shipment of
arms, by the raising of funds, and by
other means, which the spirit of our
institutions an dthe tenor of our laws
do not permit to be made the subject of
criminal prosecutions. Some of them,
though Cubans at heart and in all their
feelings and interests, have taken out
papers as naturalized citizens of the
United States, a proceeding resorted to
w-ith a view to possible protection by
this government, and not unnaturally
regarded with much indignation by the
country of their origin. The insur
gents are undoubtedly encouraged and
supported by the widespread sympathy
the people of this country always and
instinctively feel for every struggle for
better and freer government and which,
iu tie case, of tho more adventurous
and restless elements of our people
leads in only too many instances to ac
tive and persdnal participation in the
contest. The result is that this gov
ernment is constantly called upon to
protect American citizens, to claim
damages for injuries to persons and
property now estimated at many mil
lions of dollars, and to ask explana
tions and apologies for the acts of
Spanish officials, whose zeal for the
repression of rebellion sometimes blinds
them to the immunities belonging to
the unoffending citizens of a friendly
power. It follows from the same cause
that the United States Is compelled
to actively police a long line of sea
coast against unlawful expeditions, the
escape of which the utmost vigilance
will not always suffice to prevent.
These inevitable entanglements of the
United States with the rebellion in Cu
ba, the large American property in
terests affected, and considerations of
philanthropy and humanity in general,
have led to a vehement demand in va
.rious quarters, for some sort of positive
intervention on the part of the United
States. It was at first proposed that
belligerent rights should be occorded
to th insurgents aproposition no long
er urged because untimely and in prac
tical operation clearly perilous and in
jurious to our own Interests. It has
since been and is now sometimes con
tended that the independence of the In
surgents should be recognized,. But
imperfect and restricted as the Spanish
government of the island may be, no
other exists there unless the will of
thet military officer in temporary com
mand of a pwtlcular district can be
dignified as a species of government.
It is now also suggested that the United
States should buy the .island a sugges
tion possibly worthy of consideration if
there were any evidence of a desire or
willingness on the part of Spain to en
tertain such a proposal. It Is urged,
finally, that, all other methods failing,'
the existing internecine strife in Cuba
should be terminated by our interven
tion, even at he cost of a war between
the United States and Spain a war
which its advocates confidently proph
esy could be neither large in its propor
tions nor doubtful in its issue.
The correctness of this foreoast need
be neither affirmed nor denied. The
United States has, nevertheless, a char
acter to maintain as a nation, which
plainly dictates that right and not
might should be the rule of its con
duct. Further, though the United States
is not a nation to which peace Is a ne
cessity, it is in truth the most pacific
of powers, and desires nothing so much
as to live in amity with all the world.
Its own ample and diversified domains
satisfy all possible longings for terri
tory, preclude all dreams of conquest,
and prevent any casting of covetous
eyes upon neighboring regions, however
attractive. That our conduct towards
Spain and her dominions has consti
tuted no exeception to this national dis
position is made manifest by the course
of our government, not only thus far
during the present insurrection, but
during the ten years that followed the
rising at Yara in 1868. No other great
power, it may be safely said, under
circumstances of similar . perplexitiy
would have manifested the same re
straint and the same patient endurance.
It may also be said that this persistent
attitude of the United States towards
Spain in connection, with Cuba, unques
tionably evinces no slight respect and
regard for Spain on the part of the
American people. They in truth do
not forget her connection with the dis
covery of the western hemisphere, nor
do they underestimate the great quali
ties of the Spanish people nor fail to
fully recognize their splendid patriot
ism and their chivalrous devotion to the
national honor. They view wit'li won
der and admiration the cheerful reso
lution with which vast bodies of men
are sent across thousands of miles of
ocean, and an enormous debt accumu
lated, that the costly possession of 'the
Gem of the Antilles may still hold its
place in the Spanish crown. And yet
neither the government nor the people
of the United States have shut their
eyes to the course of events in Cuba, or
have failed to realize the importance
of conceded grievances, which have led
to the present revolt from the author
ity of Spain grievances recognized by
the Queen Regent and by the Cortes,
voiced by the most patriotic and en
lightened of Spanish statesmen, regard
to property, and demonstrated by re
forms proposed by the executive and
approved by the legislative branch of
thethe Spanish government. It is in
the assumed temper and disposition of
the Spanish government to remedy
these grievances, fortified by indica
tions of influential puolic opinion In
Spain, that this government has hoped
to discover the most promising and
effective means of composing the pres
ent strife with honor and advantage to
Spain and with the achievement of all
the reasonable objects of the insurrec
tion. - ' .
It would seem that If Spain should of
fer to Cuba genuine antomony a meas
ure of home rule, which, while pre
serving the sovereignty of Spain, would
satisfy all national requirements of her
Spanish subjects 'there should be no
just reason why the pacification of the
island might not be effected on that ba
sis. Such a result would appear to be
Mi the true interest of all concerned.
It would at once stop the conflict which
is now consuming the resources of the
island and making it worthless for
