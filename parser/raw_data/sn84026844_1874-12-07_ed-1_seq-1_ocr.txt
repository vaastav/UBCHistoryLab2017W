VOL. XXIII. WHEELING. WEST VA.. MONDAY MORNING, DECEMBER 7, 1874. NO. 56.
The Wheeling A Lako Erie Railroad.
We arc indebted to Judge CocniuH,
who returned from Sandusky Saturday
eight, for Sandusky papers of Friday and
Saturday, and from him and them wo
gather several items ol interest concernlog
the Wheeling & Lake Erie Railroad
Company. Messrs. Wood, Cocniun and
CiurjuN, of the Executive Committee
ui the Company, wero over most or the
Hue last week, taking up remaining Block
bjoka and arranging goncrallyllor the annual
meeting to bo held at Norwalk on
tUo 15th Inst., and lor tho early rctump'
tlon ol work on tho hundred miles from
the coal Qelda to the Lako. On this trip
they obtained additional stock books to
tho amount of nearly $300,000, and all the
subscription books on their lino from
Martin's Ferry to Sandusky Inclusive aro
now in tho hands ol the company. The
- >.-?uuunu f iktyi" vmo iuaur&Dces
from Mr. Wood that the road would bo Id
operation from tkero to the coal Holds
before tlio closo ot 1875, and says Ibat
Mr. Biiahly will be thero this month and
will mako that city his headquarters.
The road is loeated through the towns
ol Hopedalc, Lecsviile, Zaar, Bolivar,
Navarre, and Dalton to l>odl, and thcnce
conditionally through Wellington, Norwalk
and llilaa to Bjndusky, and it is
probable that, as tho conditions are about
uiet, that the conditional location will bo
rnado absolute on or before the annual
meeting on tho 15th, making a distance
trom hero to Sandusky of 153 miles, and
to Toledo ol 198 miles.
Tho present Board o! Directors were
elected and .classified last December as
lollows:
Joel Wood, Martin's Ferry, 3 years;
Joseph Bell, Wheeling, 3 years; R. II.
Cochran, Wheeling, 3 years; Siuion
Ueiter, Zaar, 3 years; Thos. W. Chapman,
Navarre, 3 years; Nathan Ilasaer, SmithHeld,
2 years; Cyrus McNeely, Ilopedale,
k. u. una, uauon, ? yearr, X'. u. ijoctcwood,
Milan, 2 yearn; A. W. Hendry,
SaudusUy, 1 year; Henry Ainsworth,
L idi, 1 year; L. M, Roby, Lccsville, 1
year; James Kerr, Martin's Perry 1 year.
The meeting on tho 15th Is to elect
lour Directors for tho term ol three years
to 1111 the vacancies then resulting from
the expiration of tho term of tho last four
Directors named. Thus, whilo arrangements
are maturing for the construction
uf tho hundred miles from the Lake in
this direction, matters are not quite bo
clearly defined as to tho fifty-eight miles
Irom 7. jar to the Ohio river.
From an article in tho Cleveland Sundjij
Horning Votes, ol November 29th,
copied in tha Toledo Commercial ot Friday
last, wb seo that tho survey ol tho
Valley Railway from Cleveland through
Akron and .Canton, "contemplates a connection
In Fairfield township, Tuscarawas
county, witli Uio Wheeling & liase Krie
Railroad thus opening two now routes to
the Ohio River," and wo learn that prop
oaitions looking to the connections named,
lave been made to Wheeling, but how
nearly negotiations have been matured
we are not advised. Propositions have
also been made by tho Atlantic and South
Eastern Riilway Company for a connec
UUU WIIUIUU TTIlfCllUg !IUU U tliC
Kailroad at Hopodaie by which they desire
to reach the river. This ia understood to
be au arm lostered by tlio Eric and tho
Atlantic anil Great Western Companies
by which they seek the Ohio river at or
near this point These movements it
matured present a rather promising and
tormidiblo combination by which either
of the companies named, and the local interests,
may bo largely strengthened.
Ulsniaick'* Attitude In Germany.
Our foreign news this morning shows
that tho attitude of tho German Chancellor
toward tho Ultramontane party in tho
Reichstag is as uncompromising as ever,
tie even goes bo far as to formally withdraw
some conciliatory remarks hitherto
made because ol his desiro and intention
that the Government shall not seem to
seek peaco with Romo on any terms.
Saturday morning's dispatches gavo the
proceedings of a hot debate the day betore
In the Reichstag, in the course of
which Bismarck made a hitter allusion
to tho recent attempt to assassinate him.
Uo did not hesitate to identify the wouldbe
assassin with tho Ultramontane party.
In his remarks he said:
i'; asked Kullman -why ho wished to
kill me. lie answered, 'On account ol
the church laws, and because you injured
my party.' I asked,'Which party fund
in; ronlital. "Tho Centre or Ultraman
tmes."1 (Great tumuli m the Chamhere.)
"You may thrust Kullman away; ho
nevertheless belongs to you."
Here the house buret into cheers, which
were loud and long continued. As this
applause subsided cries of "p(ui," "pfui,"
were heard Irom tho Ultramoutami
benches. Tho President declared theso
exclamations unparliamentary.
Bismarck?"I have uo right to censuro
such exclamations. Piui is an expression
ot disgust and contempt. I myself am
not a stranger to these feelings, but hope
1 am too polite to so express them."
Windhorst, Ultramontane, rose and
said that in his speech from tho balcony
in KIssengen.Miftcr Killlamn's attempt,
Bismarck gavo tho signal lor tho attack
on the Centre. It was wrong to incite
one party against another. They were
drifting, without that, towards war.
Bismarck repelled the accusation. Ho
pointed to tho continued incitement in
tho Ultramontane press, sad to the events
which led to tho attempt of Kullman on
his lilo, and added?"were I to beliovo
half of what the Ultramontane papers say
vjainst me, who knows what I should
do."
The cause of this contest in Germany
bstween the Imperial government and
tho Ultramontanoa Is, as we havo belore
explained, tho dogma of infallibility.
About two years ago laws wore passed
uy tho i'ruESian chambers making it an
oflcnto for any "soryant of religion" to
promulgate the dogma ol infallibility, on
the ground that tho dogma is a denial of
tho author!tv of tho Kine. Theso laws
prohibit tho discussion ol any political
question from tho -pulpit, or tho advising
ot tho congregation In any matter wherein
the State is concornod, and provide
various penalties in tho shape ol flee, imprisonment
and removal. It has been
difficult to executo them, and a number
ol prelates have gone to prison or suffered
fines rather than obey them. So bitter
lias been the contest that,tome persons
have supposed that Bismarck would be
compiled to change his pplicy, but ho
sho?n no signs as yet ol doing so,
Failure to Agree at Fllttburih.
It will ba Been by our Pittsburgh iliapatch
that the iron manufacturers and
puddlers have failed to compromise their
(liQerencea, and that a lock-out In moat
ol the mills commences to day. It is announced
that by this misfortune 40,000
peoplo will bo thrown out ol employment,
which is a very gross exaggeration. The
number ot peoplo directly a fleeted by it
in tho iron and coal business inay possibly
roach 10,000, but is not likely to exceed
that limit. And certainly this is
bid enough, lu addition to the number
thus directly thrown out ol employment
there will bo a considerable number ol
peoplo indirectly injured, such as the retailers,
especially those who turnish sup- i
plica to tho families of tbo puddicra and
coal miners. Tho situation is not as bad
as il there was to be a total atoppago oi
tho mills. For tho present only the
nniMU ??1 1" ?... -I
jmuuiuia tt in in tuiunu uui \n num.
Aa long &a tho supply ot muck '
iron (that is, iron that lias been
puddled) lasts, the other departments of
the mills, such aa heating, rolling, nailing, ,
Ac., will go on aa usual. By the time j
this supply is used tip it is not impossible 1
that some compromise can bo (fleeted bo- !
tween the manufacturers and puddlers: ,
One ot the Pittsburgh papers asserts that i
up to this time tho puddlers have not bo- 1
lieved that tho; manufacturers wcro in j
earnest, and that their decision not to accept
a reduction has turned upon this (
point. "Had they really believed that a ,
lock-out would be the result, an arrange- <
ment would have been readied before
this." If this is correct, it is not impossi- (
ble that an understanding will bo arrived j
at sooner than has been expected. In .
any event it is hardly likely tliat wo will I
seo a protractcd lock-out like that of ,
1808. Such a contest as that may well i
be dreaded by both sidcB. i
Tho President's Message.
Tho Second Session of the 43d Congress i
will meet '.tO'dav atJnoon. There is not 1
likely to be any delay in receiving tho
Presidents message as both houses are
already organized and ready for business.
We tberelora cipect to presentour readers
with the message to-morrow morning. In
regard to the contents ot tho message it is
said that it will take strong grounds in
lavor ol an early return to specie payments?stronger
evenithan the veto message
of last spring. Wo opine, however, (
that Congress will pay very little attention
to such a recommendation. Having
passed an infittion bill at the last session,
and lost it by the veto,-the members are
not likely to go over to tho President's
views, ltis sale, thcroloro, to say that
Congress will do nothing in regard to the
finances thia'scssion. The Republicans
will bo shy of opening ;np any old sores
between this and tho Presidential election,
and tho Democrats will be, if anything,
shyer still. And as it will bo with
this Congress, so will it be with tho next.
A wide berth will be given to all embarrassing
issues. Both'parlies intend to go
into the Presidential campaign of 1876
with as little "imptdimentu" (as Jdliui
<J.v.!an called ma uaggage) as possiuie.

PITTSBURGH IRON PUDDIERS.
Will not Agree to a Redaction of
Wages?Forty Thousand Men Probably
Thrown Ont of Work on
Monday.
I'lTTsnuituir, December 5. ?At the
final conference between the iron manufacturers
and puddlera this afternoon, the
proposition made by tho manufacturers ol
five dollars per tun for boiling was rejeeted
by tho puddlera. The result is
that a general suspension of tho mills will
take place on Monday, with tho exception
of one or two mills, which will continue
to pay theprcsont prices, six dollars
per ton, until their contracts are Oiled.
A largo amount ol muck bar, and unfinished
iron is held iu stock by the various
firms in this city, doubtless sufficient to
meet tho demand for some time to come.
The result ol a continued lock out will be
somewhat discouraging, as a failure ol the
two parties to come to an ageemcnt will
throw out of employment about forty
thousand men, and seriously nflect the
ron and coal interests of the State.

tiib message not qoite completed.
Washington, December 0.?The President's
message is not yet quite com- 1
pletcd, owing to delay in receiving the
report ol tho District of Columbia Comniasioners,
a reference to which will be 1
idded to the message to-morrow morning,
llthough the President has shown the
nessago to no person other than members
o! the Cabinet and copyists, there Is 1
;ho best reason lor believing it will con- :
:ain substantially tho lollowing points, i
round?d on the expressions of tho Presilent
to intimate Iriends since the message i
svaa submitted to and cordially indorsed
ay the Cabinet on Friday last. Tho Pres- ;
dent says that although ho did not commence
the preparation of his message i
intil a week ago yoaterday, Eome of tho
aowspapers previously prognosticated its
contents, although he had consulted no- :
aody as to what it should contain. Tucre
a no doubt tbo message -will stato that
)ur relations,with all foreign powers are
friendly and without disturbance, though
hero is an unsettled question with Venezuela,
which has not yet paid tho awards
jf tho Joint Commission under tho con- <
irentson of 1809. Congress, it will be
recollected, strongly expressed its cense
jn this subject in February, 1873.
Tho President in his mcssago of last
December said there was reason to boieve
tho hesitancy of that Republic I
n recognizing tho claims of Spain, i
iprung in pwt at least, from the real i
lilllculty in discharging them in i
sonncction with its obligations to
)thcr governments, and thereforo the i
ixpedicncy of further forbearance on the i
)art ol our Government,was believed to bo i
worthy of tho consideration ol Congress, i
a addition to Venezquela we have unset- I
led questions with Bpnin growing out of I
he allairof tho Virginius, and other i
;rievou3 transactions on tho part of the i
jpaniali authorities in connection with I
vents in Cuba. Tho magnitude of the ol- i
ensea has not been reduced since the I
'resident's previous message, a year ago. <
Li this unsettled condition ol affairs in i
;uba, cannot long continuo, it may be- 1
:ome necessary lor other nations with <
iur own to interfere, to terminate the '
nsurrection which has bo loDg prevailed, <
he Spanish Government having unsuc- 1
lessfully attempted to suppress it. f
n the meautiuie, the commerce of all t
OUnineS, nuu eHJit'Liaiiy iu?i ui luu t
Jnited States Millers, tho Uiga ol I
bo United States and of England t
laving been insulted. The President in (
onversation, although he does not state
bo lact in his message, says the United
itatea purchases about 80 per cent ol tho
yuban exports, and theretoro tho duties j
laid by American citizens contribute, to
his extent, in helping Spain to continue j
bo war against the Insurgents. Tho j
'renident had hoped that by tho meeting I
it Congress to-morrow tho present ne- J
;otiations with Spain would have been :
nded, but in this ho has bcon disappoint- :
!d. llo therefore sayB in his mesaago but J
ittlo or nothing about tho pending nego
iations, but at a futuro time will present f
ho subject to tho special consideration ol ,
Jongiess. Tho position ol the President f
in tho financial question is as positive as '
iver, notwithstanding tho former spccu- ,
ations of those who spoko without au- :
hority. Ho desires and will recommend :
ho resumption of specie payments at tho :
larlicst practicable day, but ho does not :
lelieve this can bo reached as soon as the
st of Jan. 1870. Ho does not namo any 1
lay, loaving Congress to dovise meanB to
ecuro tho desired end, it being tho duty 1
il Congress to do so. Tho legal tender i
lauso ol the currency act should bo ro- i
icaled, to take ellect as to contracts mado I
Iter a clay to bo fixed by law for its re- f
leal. Powers should bo given to tho i
Secretary ol tho Treasury to obtain gold 1
rom and after the dato fixed for tho re- t
umptiou ol specie payments by tho is- I
canco of bonds. In addition to this, tho i
evenaes of the Government should bo in \
ixcess of tho expenditures. To support i
esumptlon, greater economy should bo i
iractlced in all departments of tho Gov- 1
irnmcnt, and if necessary, tho customs i
ind intanal revenue laws should bo ;
ihanged In order to Becure a larger amount i
o( revenue. With tho return ol specie
payments, banking should bo free. The
bond holder should contlnuo to bo protected
as at present under tho
banking laws, There should bo no limitation
to tho -volume of currency, us
the community itsell should determine
what amount is required for business
transactions, instead ot leaving tho Executive,
Secretary ol tho Treasury and Congress
to tlx tho limit. It would be the
duty ol Congress, however, to make regulations
regarding Ireo banks of issue, and
to Btste tho conditions upon which they
can bo organized and transact business,
the legislation to be in accordance with
the now order of things, or, in other
words, the resumption ol specio payments.
There should bo no monopoly by
fixing tho amount of the issue. Tho 1'reaident
will recommend that Congress do
not interloro with tho present currency
act, passed during tho last session, unless
to amend it so as to conform with a plan
lor tho resumption ol specie payments.
Tho President will malio no
recommendation on the subject ol
Internal improvoments by tho general
Government, but will merely refer to
tho fact that Congress has already
appointed a committee on transportation
routes to tho seaboordjwhich has already
made its report and will give luther information
from more recent investigations.
The President devotes much space to the
affairs in Arkansas, giving reasons why
ho declined to interfere in the recent
dillicatles, in that State, anil ho adverts
to tacts narrated in his special message to
nnntrrpoa Hn ouiH that hn luul nn
specific recommendation to make on tho
subject, but it tbero was any practical
way of removing these difficulties by legislation
then ho' earnestly requested that
tho question might bo taken up at that
session of Congress. He was extremely
anxious to avoid any pretense of undue
interference in tho titate affairs, and ir
CongresB differed from him as to what
ought to bo done, ho requested its immediate
decision to that etlcct, otherwise
ho should feel obliged as iar as
ho could by tho exercise of legitimate
authority to put an end
to tho unhappy controversy which disturbed
tho peace and prostrated the business
ot Louisiana by the recognition and
support ol that Government which was
recognizcd and upheld by the Courts <>i
that State. It seemed advisable that lie 1
should state which courso he should Icel
bound to pursue in reference to the matter,
in tho event of 110 action being taken
by Congress at that time. IJut subject to
any satiifactory arrangement that might
be made by the parties to the controversy,
and which ot all things was the most dosirable,
it would be his duty as iar as it
might be necessary lor him tu act, to ad- 1
hero to the Government heretofore rocog- 1
nized by him. The President again sub- :
mits this question to Congress, and he
will continue to act as ho has heretofore
acted relativo to tho ait lira of Louisiana,
unless otherwise controlled by Congress.
The President Reiterates his confidence in
the Indian peace policy, and if adhered
to he says it will produce additional
and bcncficial results, and
ultimately Irco the frontier of
Indian depredations. He alludes to the
civil servico reform saying, that it has
been as closely adhered to as the opposition
manifested against it permitted, its
results have been beneficial, having
elevated the capacity and tone of appointments
ol several departments ul the
government, but it would bo impossible
to continue the reform without the direct
support ol Congress and sometimes by the
people. The President alludes to tho reports
of tho heads of several departments,
which accompany tho message, and calls
attention to their respective recommendations.
iio again recommends the passage
of the law establishing a Court lor the
adjudication of claims of aliens againBt
the government, a bill for this purpoae
having been introduced by Judge
Lawrenco at a previous session of
Congress?the President does not allude
to the Utah affairs?the subject being left
open for future consideration. He
n a 11 n Oltnnfliin tn tlin fant thftt ('hirw>an
immlgnints continue to bo brought to
ihia country under the condition ol slaves,
accordiug to contract, and al60 women
whose character is such as to demoralize
tbo communities in which they are
located. Ho invites legislation on this
subject, saying that it will bo his pleasure
13 well as duty to enforce any law on this
subject. The President, in further conversation,
said ho had three vacant Judgjhips
to fill, namely,in Alabama, Arkansas
ind Louisiana. It was probable that he
might be successful in appointing a euitiblo
appoiuteo for Alabama from that 1
State, but as to the other States
[hero was raoro dilllculty, and he i
might therefore bo forced to appoint
persons not resident in them. As to Ar* '
ianaas, thoso best suited lor place wcro i
jither in lavor of the Garland Govern- ;
ment, or desired its overthrow. Anoillcer
)f tho army or navy, he said, would bo 1
ippointed to look after the comfort of the
(ting ot the liawaitan Islands and suite,
luring their sojourn in Washington. ,
rhey will bo located at a hotel, tho |
Government paying tho expenses. The ,
President will entertain tho King at ,
Stato Dinner, in addition to tho cour- ,
ciics to be extended to him by tho |
Secretary ol Btate. This will bo the ]
irst visit of a King to Washington. A |
najority of tho members of both houses f

TIIK WEIGHING OP MAILS. I
In regard to iho question wliero news- '
>apcrs and other printed matter must be j
weighed for the prepayment of postage '
inder tho new law on and alter January

ho weighing to be dono at the postulllco, t

iBrollT OP THE 8ECRETAIIY OP TOE NAVY. '
Tho annual report of tho Secretary ol
be Navy has been submitted to tho Prosdent.
It shows tho navy to bo in a renatkably
cfllcicnt condition, both as t
egards tho number of vessels and their ,
irmament and sea going qualities. Tho (
nvy at present consists of 103 vessels, E
ivlth 1,354 guns. 01 the Iron-clad or t
irmored vessels, 10 aro ot the first class t
ind in a condition lor actual and cfllcicnt t
icrvice. Four olhers, of tho class ol t
powerful doubiC'turreted monitors, are <
sctually on hand undergoing repairs, and
> tilth is well worth some attention, but >
Iho remainder may bo counted as really (
useless for any active and efficient pur- (
posei One hall ol tho steam navy adapt- ,
id to cruising is in commission and in j
actual scrvlco. This number ol vessels
can not bo prudently diminished, but if it
is to bo maintained, there must bo a
gradual and constant addition to the
navy to supply tho places ol those which
aro each year found to bo worn out and
unlit tor further service, and for this purpose
a fixed amount of tonnago should bo
built every year. This amount may be
small but It should be constant and unfailing.
To this end tho Department has
accumulated a largo amount ol live oak
timber in tho various navy yards, whero
it will yearly improve in condition aud
lio available aa tho very best material for
the frames of any ships it may at any
time bo necessary or desirablo to builu.
The rapid and almost comploto dlsaapcarance
of this moat valuablo ship timber,
Irom our shores?largo quantities being
sent abroad?should arreat the attention
of Congress,and measures should bo taken
to accuro what remains.
Tho Secretary recites tho facta in the
Virginius afhir and refers to tbo yellow
fever epedemlc at Pensacola, and the
great naval drill oil tho coast of Florida.
lio recommends that it' tho Icelandic
Committco sent out in a government vessel
to examine several points on the Alaska
coast, with a view of a settlement by
their countrymen, shall find at any point
on the Pacific coast a satisfactory loca
tion, whatever assistance tho government
is competent to extend toward establishing
an Icolandic colony there, be oDercd,
as tho Icelanders would ha a valuable acquisition
to tho naval service of trained
American seamen in time ol need.
The Secretary calls attention to tho importance
ol a hydrographic ollicc, and
thinks special attention should bo given
to surveys of tho North Pacific Ocean,
and urges the propriety ol increasing and
developing tho resources of tho Navy

balance ol tho appropriation! lor the
building ol new stoops, and a special appropriation
to rcinburso bureaus lor their
extraordinary expenditures during tho

Berlin, December 5.?Tho Reichstag
vrus to day engaged in a discussion upou
?he eatimates ol the Foreign OIBco. The
Ultramontano Deputy Windhorst spoko
nt length, lio assailed tho Government
lor suppressing tho Legation at the Vatican,
and dcclarcd that such action would
not estrange German Catholics from the
I'opo.
Biemarck said that upon reading the
report cl tho last debato in the Chamber,
ho discovered that bo had expressed conciliatory
sentiments, which ho must now
withdraw, because ho did not desire to 1
cxposo himself to tho misrepresentation
that the Imperial Government sought
peaco with Home upon any terms. Germany
recognized tho I'opo as the head of i
the Catholic Chnrcb, but required no legation
at tho Vatican. If negotiations <
with tho Popo ore necessary, they can bo
conducted through tho Ambassador to '
Italy. 80 long as tho Popo urges the 1
Catholic clergy to break the laws of the
States in which they live, diplomatic, rotations
between himself and Germany
wero useless. Tho Vatican desired vie
tory ior Franco in tho lato war; that ,
could be proved. In conclusion Bismarck
said he should meet Windhorst In discussion
on tho si. t jeet again in tho Prussian
Dial.
