NO AGREEMENT WITH REDS
^ftcessary, But an Inspector Will Takf
ths Measure to the In
dians, Neverthe
less, •.
Washington, Dec. U.—Senator Gam
.ble has introduced a bill to open the
lands of the Standing Rock and Chey
enne Indian reservations in Sehuasse
-county, in the northwest, part of South
Dakota.
West of the Missouri about 1,000,000
acres are covered, in the western part
-of the two reservations. The bill pro
vides for three commissioners to ap
praise the lands and make a classifica
tion of them. Thev must quality in
twenty days after appointment, by the
president arid complete the work with
in four months.
The bill carries an appropriation for
the payment for the school lands of
475,OOO, which are to go to the state,
a.nd $20,000 additional for expenses of
appraisement and any allotment of
work necessary.
The senator tias had the matter un
-der discussion with the interior depart
ment for some time and expects an in
spector will toe sent to take it up with
the Indians, locking to an agreement in
line with the bill's provisions.
The act could be passed independent
•of agreement, but it is thought best to
secure the Indians' consent.
If the bill passes the lands will like
ly be opened next fall or early in 1906.
The lands are highly desirable for agri
cultural purposes and grazing, and lie
along the Milwaukee's extension.

•. SUNDAY LAW RAIDS.
Kansas City, Dec. 11.—Klaw &
Erlanger last night notified the
manager of the Willis Wood the
ater that they would not permit
their company of seventy-five
persons, headed by Frank Moul
an and Lillian Berri, to present
Pixley & Luders' comic opera.
"The Grand Mogul," at the the
ater last night, as they did not
wish to subject the members of
the company to the embar
rassment of appearing before a
criminal judge to answer the
charge of violating the Missouri
law which forbids labor on Sun
day. The company w-as billed to
begin a week's engagement at
he Willis Wood last night and
the management filed vigorous
protest against the attitude of
Klaw & Erlanger, but without
avail, and last night the Willis
Wood was dark. The management
announced last night that the
theater will be opet. ori Sunday
in the future.
All other theaters except the
Majestic, a burlesque house, were
open yesterday, but the perform
ances were not altogether satis
factory to the patrons at some
of the houses, where the man
agement used as few actors as
possible.
New York, Dec. 11.—Result of the
closed Sunday in New York: Theaters
and concert halls closed. 50 penny
and nickel arcades closed, 400 dance
halls kept shut, 500 clubs and societies
affected, 50 entertainments postponed,
100 lectures put off, 25 probable at
tendance at concerts, 10,000 probable
attendance at theaters, 75,C00 esti
mated visitors to all arcades, 120,000
total persons deprived of Sunday
amusement, 350,000 loss to actors, em
ployes and musicians, $75,000 esti
mated loss to amusement interests.
$150,000.
New York, Dec. 11.—New York, which
can usually be depended on to provide
something new and sensational, yester
day treated its millions of residents and
tens of thousands of week end
visitors to the novelty of a thoroughly
"blue Sunday," the first, and p-'obably
the last, in the history of the metrop
olis.
Fe had expected to live to use the
day. There have been more or less
"dry" Sundays and Sundays without
baseball, but the memory of the "old
est inhabitant" failed to recall a Sab
bath here when one was compelled to
choose between the churches and the
joarks If he would see or hear some
thing to entertain him.
Incidentally the police department
demonstrated that it was equally ef
fective in enforcing obnoxious or "pop
ular statutes. The aldermen will meet
on Thursday to modify the ordinances
so far as their authority goes.
There were few attempts to evade the
law following Police Commissioner
Bingham's announcement, that all Sun
day entertainments must cease in ac
cordance with Justice O'Gorman's in
terpretation of the Sunday closing act.
Over in Brooklyn three proprietors of
moving picture shows who had gone
to the trouble of getting out injunc
tions restraining the police from inter
fering with their business kept open
but with these exceptions the amuse
ment promoters held to their avowed
intention of resting their cases with
the people, with confidence that public
opinion would demand a modification
of the law which prohibited all sorts of
amusement on the "Lord's day"
"Closed."
The effect of the Sunday closing
was everywhere apparent. Broadway
was deserted except for those who found
nothing better to do than to walk the
streets. The hush throughout the great
white way was painful to ears accus
tomed to the weekday noises and Sun
day harmonies. Upon the doors of the
Opera houses, theaters, music halls
dancing academies, skating rinks and
penny arcades placards had been
posted. These bluntly announced that
the places had been closed for the day
in accordance with Justice O'Gorman's
decision. At the theaters even the box
offices were closed and the advance
sales for the week Interrupted.
At the various branches of the
Young Men's Christian association the
usual Sunday programs were radically
changed. The stereopticon exhibitions
illustrating scriptural texts and mov
ing pictures which have been a feature
of the Sunday afternoon meetings were
suspended for the day. The services foil
lowed strictly religious lines. Nothing
that In any way suggested a diversion
was permitted.
SPIES WATCH FOR OPEN
SALOONS IN CHICAGO
Chicago, Dec. 11.—New tactics were
employed by the Chicago'Law and Or
der league in its warfare on Sunday sa
loons yesterday. Instead of devoting
their energies to collecting evidence
merely, agents of the organization
sought for violations of the law and
then notified the policeman on the beat
that the state law was being violated
and it was his duty to arrest the of
fenders. Refusals by the patrolmen
were followed by warnings that the
league would institute proceedings
against him for neglect of duty. So
far as can be ascertained only one po
liceman was called upon in this man
ner. He was taken to a saloon at State
and Van Buren streets at 3 a. m.. and
his attention was called to the fact
that a bartender was serving intoxi
cating drinks to twenty-five custom
ers in violation not only of the state
law regarding Sunday closing, but also
of a city ordinance requiring all sa
loons to close at 1 o'clock. According
to E. J. Davis, vice president of the
league, the policeman refused to arrest
the bartender without a warrant. The
early morning expedition of the league's
agents visited a number of saloons in
the west and central portions of the
city, but reported no violations of law,
except at one place. The saloons vis
ited included those of Anderman John
J. Brennan and Michael Kenna, other
wise known as "Hinky Dink." the poli
ticlan.

KING OSCAR, SWEDEN'S
RULER, IS DEAD
Washington, Dec. 11.—The
president today sent the follow
ing telegram to the new king of
Sweden:
"I deeply sympathize with
your majesty and with the. peo
ple of Sweden in the loss of your
honored father and venerated
sovereign.
"Theodore Roosevelt."
Stockholm, Dec. 11—Preparations for
the funeral of King Oscar, who died
Sunday morning at the age of 78, are
under way. The whole nation is in
mourning. Stockholm's streets are
almost deserted and most of the
business places are closed. The
succession to the throne of Sweden
now passes to Oscar Gustave
Adolphe, duke of Verland, the oldest
son of the late king. At a meeting of
the council of state Sunday afternoon
the new king took the oath of allegiance
under the title of Gustave V., and
adopted the motto, "With the people,
for the fatherland.",
"The last hours of the expiring mon
arch were passed in unconsciousness,
and up to the end he gave no sign
of recognizing those about him. The
queen was grief stricken because he
could not bid her farewell and she is
in a serious condition.
A Lover of
In Crisis of 1905.
The first Bernadotte secured Norway
for his appanage by invading and
threatening the country, after it had
been delivered into his hands by Eu
rope. Yet he took counsel of his bet
ter self and granted It the Eidsvold con
stitution. The fourth Bernadotte per
mitted Norway to go her way again,
more in sorrow than in anger. He
raised no hand to prevent what he
thourht an illegal and unconstitutional
act. He permitted no member of his
family to countenance the talk that
was rife of belligerent reprisal. He
caused it to be known that no matter
'hat might betide in that tense crisis
of 1905, he -would never consent to war
unless Sweden was attacked. The un-*
ion, he declared, was not worth the
blood and treasure that w-ould have
to be expended if it were to be saved
by war. Once before, in 1895, he had
wii.ii firm hand put clown «i war party
that had arisen, led by his own son.
who now succeeds him. Gustaf was
young and hotblooded then and he
wanted to lead Swedish soldiers to the
gates of Christiania to settle the crisis

Oscar II., fourth of the Bernadottes
who have ruled Sweden, and a mon
arch as sincerely beloved by his people
as any of modern times has crossed the
bar. That great marshal of Napoleon
who, when once he found himself as
sured of the northern throne, found it
expedient to make common cause of the
enemies of his old master, was the only
one of the Napoleonic brood of new
made monarchs that was able to found
an enduring dynasty. He transmitted
to his grandson, the dead king, the
Bernadotte capacity for statecraft, but
not the Bernadotte fighting spirit. For
Oscar was ever a lover of peace. The
thought of bloodshed and war was ab
horrent to him always, and it was the
desire closest to his heart to bring his
long and prosperous reign to a close
without the disgrace of one smirch of
blood across it.

MISSI .G, T..IAL HALTS
San Francisco, Dec. 11.—The disap
pearance of ox-Supervisor James L.
Gallagher, one of the mi.t important
witnesses for the state in ths graft
cases and the Inability cf the prose
cution to locate htm, caused a post
ponement today of the trial of Patrick
Calhoun, president of the United Rail
wav* IMH
fe®
not foreseen, and his early years were
devoted to the pursuits of a Swedish
country gentleman, to literature and to
art. He had already attained a repu
tation as a poet and an author of real
merit, when the chance of death called
him to the throne. His new vocation
left him little leisure to woo the muse,
but his gift for oratory came Into fre
quent play, and he became noted for
his real eloquence as well as for his
felicity of expression. The details of
kingcraft he easily mastered, and his
reign has been of a character to win
him the love and loyalty of all Swe
den.
Though the Swedish court is most
ceremonious, the old king had the gift
of getting close to the hearts of the
people. He was most democratic in his
manners and easily approachable.
When in the early days of the crisis,
40,000 Stockholmers marched out to
his palace through the glorious twi
light of a Swedish June night to ex
press to him the love and confidence
of his people in the hour of trial, the
old king came out on a balcony and,
with his gray locks bared to the breeze,
invited them all to come up close where
they could hear him. They had sent
a deputation and kept a respectful
distance themselves. "Come right up
close," he called out, "where we can
see and hear each other. You are not
afraid of your old king, are you?"
Oscar II., king of Sweden, and pre
vious to 1905 king of Norway and
Sweden, was born January 21, 1829.
He was the third son of King Oscar
and of Queen Josephine, daughter of
Prince Eugene, of Leuchtenberg, and
grand son of Marshal Bernadotte.
Oscar II. succeeded to the throne at
the death of his brother, King Carl
XV., September 18, 1872. He was
married June 6, 1857, to Queen So
phia, born June 9, 1836, daughter of
the late Duke William of Nassau.
Survived by Four.
Four children survive King Oscar—
Crown Prince Gustave, born June 16,
1858 Prince Oscar Bernadotte, born
November 15, 1859 Prince Carl, born
February 27, 1861, and Prince Eugene,
born August 1, 1865. Prince Gustave
was married September 20, 1881, to
Princess Victoria, of Baden-Baden.
Their oldest son, Prince Gustave, was
married June 15, 1905, to the Princess
Margaret Victoria, of Connaught.
Prince Oscar renounced his succession
to the throne and married. March 15,
1888, Ebba Munck, of Fulkila.
In the years 1892 ana 1893 the late
King Oscar steadfastly opposed the
proposition of the Norwegian parlia
ment for a separate consular service,
which led to Norway, October 26,
1905, declaring the union of Sweden
and Norway dissolved. The throne of
Norway was offered to a prince of the
reigning house of Sweden,, but was
declined by King Oscar, and after an
appeal to the Norwegian people.
Prince Charles, of Denmark, was elect
ed king of Norway by the Norwegian
parliament November 18, 1905.
An event of international import
ance in the life of King Oscar was his
arbitration of the Samoan claims in
1902, when he adjudged the American
and British governments to be re
sponsible for the fighting in the Sa
moan islands in 1899. He also at
tained prominence at the time of the
Venezuela dispute which caused fric
tion between the United States and
Great Britain in 1896.
It was then proposed, in case the
Cleveland arbitration commission con
sisting of four members failed to agree,
that the rvatter be referred to King
Oscar. An agreement was reached at
Paris, where the arbitration tribunal
met in the spring of 1899 and King
Oscar's intervention was not neces
sary.
King Oscar was called the ablest
ruler of the nineteenth century and
the most democratic king that ever
lived. He never made any attempt to
conceal the humble origin of his fam
ily and whenever he traveled to the
south of France he made it a point to
visit the little house at Pau where his
grandfather was born. A tablet over
the door of the little one-story house
bears this Inscription:
"The peasant, Charles Bernadotte,
who subsequently rose to be field mar
shal of France and ultimately King
Charles XIV, of Sweden and Norway,
was born in this cottage in 1763."
In appearance, however, King Os
car was every inch a king, and there
is no sovereign in all Europe who was
more stately and more regal in bear
ing than was he. King Oscar stood 6
feet 2 inches, taller than most of his
subjects, who, as a rule, arc tall men.
His eyes were blue in color, distinctive
of his race, and were commanding, but
kindly.

dren and strong men, each seeking a.
near relative or beloved friend.
The people of the town are stunned,
by the catastrophe. They had ions re
garded these mines as practically .Im
mune from dangers so common )to the
coal mining industry. The plant pf.tlw
company Is provided with every devica
for the protection of life and the equip
ment is considered the most modern,
complete outfit used In the production
of bituminous coal.
Strong Men in Tears.
Last night hundreds of men ttooft
about the entrance of the two mines.
They* said nothing, but when ap
proached and asked questions thef
would give way to their emotions* Oftea,
to tears. During the night few Hv»m~
en were to be seen, but all day yes
terday the women were the chief factors
In the most pathetic, heart sending
scenes. They crowded the sides -of the
hills overlooking the ill fated mine, .and
cried aloud In their agony of grief.
As the day advanced they became al-l
most crazed through grief and sus
pense. One woman pulled out her -hair
by the handsful, another tore all the
skin from both cheeks with her Aager
nails. Some lay down on the trosero
ground and cried themselves to Bleep.
In thiB condition many were carried
to their homes nearby without awak
ening.
Full Extent of the Horror.
It is thought, by tonight the full
extent of the horror will be known,
and It is feared the knowledge will pre
cipitate even more pitiful scenes 'than
those of today, with hysteria Jn all
its devious forms rampant among the
populace. Precautions have been taken
to prevent these harrowing manifesta
tions of grief.
Rescuing parties penetrated mine No.
6 about 3,500 feet ftefore they came upon
the first of the dead. The majority of
corpses will, it is believed, be found
about one mile further back. .It is
hardly possible all the bodies will be
recovered for several days. Four -hun
dred men are working in a territory one
mile square It wjll be days before a
thorough search of all the square can
be made. As the searching parties ad
vance they must clear -away the debris.
The explosion wrecked over 600 mine
cars and these block the entrance on
all sides. A particularly remarkable
feature is that notwithstanding the
force of the explosion very little of the
nine roof is wrecked.
The Fairmont and Clarksburg Trac
tion company's cars pass within tea
yards of the mine entrance. A large
car crowded with passengers mirac
ulously escaped being blown Into the
West Fork river. All the passengers
were stunned by the terrific concus
sion. .'
Monongah, W. Va., Dec. 10.—Many
charred bodies lying in an improvised:
morgue, four badly Injured and nearly*
600 men imprisoned by tons of coal,
rock and mine debris in the depths of
the hills surrounding this mining town,
with the chances all against a singi»
one of them being alive, is the most
accurate summary obtainable of the
mine explosion told of in yesterday af
ternoon's dispatches, which in all prob
ability was attended by greater loss of
life than any former disaster In the his
tory of the bituminous coal mining in
dustry of America.
The explosion occurred shortly after
10 a. in., after the full force of 500 had
gone to work in the two mines affected.
The mines are Nos. 6 and 8, of the Con
solidated Coal company, located on op
posite sides of the west fork of the river
at this place, but merged In their un
derground workings by a heading and
on the surface by a great steet tipple1
and bridge.
JAPAN WILL KILL
Walter Clifton, manager of the For
mosa Mercantile company, who arrived!
here yesterday, is authority for the.
statement that to wipe out this tribe.,
which is retarding the commercial de
velopment of Porrnosa, heroic measures
are being adopted by the Japanese.
"These head-hunters," said Clifton,
"number about 100,000, and infest thet
entire east coast of the island. All ef-.
forts to civilize them have failed. They
recently inveigled a party of 800 Chi-?-.1
nese and Japanese into an ambush on a
pretense of showing them some treas
ure and kiiied ail but three.
"In punishment for this treachery-the
Japanese sent out large bodies of troops
and when the compaii-" ol' head-hunters
is located the place will he surrounded
l: a wire fence.
"The wires are charged with elec
ti iclty. Tl\e soldiers will begin to-shooT
and the savages stampede and then the
deadly \rlros will get those bullets
miss."
