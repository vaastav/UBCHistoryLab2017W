MEXICAN MURDERER BEING
SLOWLY SMUDGED TO DEATH
Gaseous Fumes.
Nook of Mine In Which Lopez
Sought Safety-Believed He Has
Been Suffocated
BINGHAM, Utah, Dec. 3. Not a
sound since last night has come irom
the Utah Apex mine, in which Ralph
Lopez, desperado, is confined. To
day all the exits except that in the
lowest level were sealed with dou
ble bulkheads, and tonight it was be
lieved that the gas filled mine had
become the fugitive's tomb.
The tense watchfulness of seven
sheriffs and over 200 deputies for a
break for liberty was relaxed, al
though the mimlK-r of guards was
not lessened. It was considered im
possible for him to approach any of
the exits without being overcome.
One by one, the crowd of officer.'
who have waited for vengeance, dis
persed tonight. It was felt that the
poisonous fumes had done their
work.
That the jaunty Mexican gun man.
who killed a fellow countryman and
five peace officers because a woman ,
favored another, may still be alive,
remains a bare possibility, His one
chance for life was to have sealed
himself up in some distant stope
against the invasion of the poisonous
gases.
Before erecting the outer bulk-
head in the Andy tunnel late today,
six men went to the inner bulkhead
300 feet from the mouth, to examine
it. Shortly afterwards one of their,
tiiimber staggered out and fell to the
earth, overcome from the gas that
had leaked through the partition.
Must Pay for Ejecting a
Passenger From Its Train
By the denial of the petition for a
rehearing in the suit of Forrester vs.
the Southern Pacific company, the
Supreme court has finally disposed
of a damage case which has attract
ed considerable attention, and f.ie
railroad company will have to pay
the amount of the judgment secured
in the lower court, together with
accrued interest.
In September, 1907, Forrester
bought a through ticket from 1 1 Otta
fen, Texas, to San Francisco. Cab-1

without question by connecting
until he reached a pouu near mot

of the Southern Pacific company.

originally, that it was stolen, or mat ,)e a warnmg to pubjic seriVCe cor

deavored in every reasonable way to
prove his identity and the validity of
the ticket, but could not convince
the train agent, who ordered that he
be ejected from the train at Mon
ttllt, which instructions were car
ried out by the train crew. The evi
dence further showed that Forrester
was very ill at the time he was put
off the train, and that the insults and
humiliation to which he was subject
ed by the train agent were so marked
that the ire of fellow passengers
was aroused. After being put off
the 'train at Montello, being without
funds, Forrester had to make his
way as best he could to Reno, where
he was obliged to enter a hospital
for treatment for a severe atttack
of pneumonia. He later went to
Stockton, California, but his health

Deputies rushed inside and carried
out the other five, all of whom had
dropped within the runnel. They
were sooiu revived but it was striking
testimony of the deadlincss of the
Bases that fill the mine.
The gases tonight were being gen
erated only in the lowest levels of
t)he mine. Here various composi
tions were being used in the smudges
which were kept burning directly
beneath shafts leading to the tipper
workings, where Lopez took refuge
last Thursday night, after eluding his
pursuers in the open for nearly a
week.
Thousands of pounds of wet gun
powder were consumed to generate
what is known and feared by miners
as "black damp." Sulphur, coal tar
formaldehyde and black oil were the
chief ingredients used in addition.
The fuel of the smudges was com
posed of coal, green wood, hay and
cotton waste.
Two hundred men are out of work
in the lower level as a result of the
smudging -operations. The leasers
are said to be suffering a net loss
of over a thousand dollars a day.
They announced, however, that they
would gladly remain idle a month in
order to bring about the death of
Lopez. The smudging will continue
lor twelve or twenty-tour hour
more. Not before Friday night, it is
thought, will the deputies be able to
crier the mine.

BELIEVES PRESIDENT WILSON
HAS THE NECESSARY MAN
LONDON; Dec. 3. The Times,
which is devoting great attention to
tne Mexican situation, is publishing
a '.fresh series of dispatches from
Mexico City calling serious attention
to "the desperate situation develop
ing in consequence of the attitude of
the United States," and declaring
that if the American tactics of
"watchful waiting" continues to be
pW.ued "there are no words too
strong to paint the disastrous re-
suits which will ensue." j
In an editorial on these dispatches
and President Wilson's message, the ,
Times says:

Outfits Seeking Values From
Bed of
At the present time three mining
outfits are working in an endeavor
to recover values from the old mills
situated along the Carson river. Dur
ing the bonanza days millions of dol
lars worth of rich Coinstock ore
was treated on the river by the score
or more of mills operated by the
Sharon, Mackay and Fair people
and others. During the old amal
gamation process not over seventy-five
per cent of the val-
nes was recovered, the tailings and
slime going into the Carson river.
It is with the hope and expectation
of recovery of (his rich deposit that
the 'hew people are working. Par
ties at the Mexican mill have erect
ed a small boat suitable for a dredge
pump, which is to be placed in op
eration at the old mill race. A vast
amount of gold and silver amalgam
has slipped over this race and it is
believed that it rests in the deep
pool formed by the action of the
water. The first recovery will be
Mlenipred at this point.

ig on this ground for several years,
has managed to take considerable
bullion and quicksilver to the refin

County Surplus
The December session of the coun
ty commissioners is fraught with
great importance to the taxpayers.
A number of new questions await
determination and some of them in
volve points that have never before
been discussed.
Chief among these was the dispo-
sition of the $56,000 surplus taxes
arising from the arbitrary increase of
$400,000 by the tax commission in
the Nye county valuation. County
Auditor Grimes had prepared a table
showing how the funds " stand and
how the revenue from the excess i
derived, with a suggestion to the
board how the taxpayers can collect
a rebate at the rate of 14 per cent
of their taxes. This was approve!
by the district attorney. The com
missioners decided not to rebate this
sum. Bonanza. ,
