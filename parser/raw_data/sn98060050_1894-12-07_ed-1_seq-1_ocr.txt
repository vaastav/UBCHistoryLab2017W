FRIDAY, DECEMBER 7, 1894.
UHATTLEHORO :
FRIDAY, DECEMBER 7, 1804.
Mr. Morrill raised an audible smile In
the Senate Wednesday by giving notlco
that on next Wednesday ho will "seek an
opportunity of submitting some brlrf re
marks on some marvelous senatorial bills
and quack panaceas for real and imaginary
public evils and grievances."
Under a ruling just made by Postmaster
General Bissell the live cent postage rate
with all countries In tho postal union will
bo extended Jan. 1st to all the countries
of the world, except Canada and Mexico,
with which the rato is fixed at two cents
by special agreement. This ruling will
practically secure tho despatch of a letter
to any place on earth where there is a
post offlco if prepaid by .1 five cent stamp.
Promptly on the opening of the session
of Congress Senator Lodgo of Massachu
setts offered a resolution calling 011 the
President for information as to the sur
render by the United States consul at
Shanghai of the two Japanese citizens who
were so cruelly tortured to death by the
Chinese authorities, as elsewhere described.
The resolution was referred to the commit
tee on foreign relations. It ought to bo
acted upon and passed promptly.
Twenty Massachusetts cities held mu
nicipal elections Tuesday. The Republi
cans were generally successful, electing 13
out of i.0 mayors. Haverhill elected a pro
hibition mayor and tho Democrats secured
the other six, although In some of these
cities the other Republican ollicials were
chosen. The most notable overturn was
In Fall River, one of the strongest Demo
cratic cities in the state, where a Republi
can mayor was elected. Thirteen cities
voted for and seven against liquor license.
The A. P. A. showed its hand in several
instances. In Springfield this organiza
tion attempted to dtfeat the reelection of
Judge Maynard, a Demociat and Roman
Catholic, to the school committee, but ho
was a successful by a majority of 1080.
The Ifl.'SHii;'.
The annual message which President
Cleveland sent to Congress on Monday is
not so exciting as one of Kipling's jungle
stories, or so mentally and spiritually up
lifting as one of Browning's poems. On
tho contrary it strikes one as a rather un
usually dry and dreary summarizing of the
several department reports and of routine
information in regard to all sorts of gov
ernmental relations. It Is noticeable that
the message contains no allusion whatever
from which one might infer that an elec
tion was held In forty states of the Union
in November. In view of the financial
and business history of the past two
years it causes an involuntary smile when
one reads the reference to "the advent of a
new tariff policy not only calculated to re
lieve the consumers of our laud in the cost
of their daily life, but to invite a better de
velopment of American thrift" But one
also admires and approves the outspoken
thrust at the sugar trust when the Execu
tor says: "If, with all tho favor now ac
corded the sugar-refining interest in our
tariff laws, It still languishes to the extent
of closed refineries and thousands of dis
charged workmen, it would seem to present
a hopeless case for reasonable legislative
aid."
It is a surprising revelation which tho
message makes of tho gross abuses exist
ing in tho postal service with regard to second-class
mail matter. According to the
figures given the entire yearly deficiency of
more than $9,000,000 is duo to what is to
all intents and purposes fraudulent matter
carried under this guise. Congress owes It
to tho country and to tho legitimate news
papers and periodicals to see that this
abuse Is promptly stopped.
Mr. Cleveland's scheme for the reform of
the currency is the subject which bas at
tracted general discussion in the daily
press, and Its main outlines are given in
our summary. This discussion has been
principally in tho line of pointing out de
fects In the system proposed. The result
will undoubtedly be to stimulate Intelligent
thought on an important subject, rather
than to secure definite legislation by tills
Congress.
The Atlantic Monthly.
An entertaining feature of tho December
number of the Atlantic Monthly is Henry
Baldwin's "An Old-Tlmo Sorosls," which
gives an account of a ladles' literary society
in Norwich, Conn., early In this century,
tho story of which Is now for the first time
told, and told with a full appreciation both
of Its valuo as a bit of social history and
tho unconscious humor to be found In Its
minutes. Sir Edward Strachcy's "Christ
mas at an English country house" Imparts
a delightful Christmas llavor to tho num
ber. Tho editor of tho magazine pays a fit
ting tribute to Oliver Wendell Holmes, who
wa. one of its earliest contributors, and re
mained Its constant friend to the last.
The announcement of the Atlantic for
1805 promises many strong features In lit
erature, art, political history, social science,
education and fiction. Especially noticeable
will bo Dr. John Eisko's series of historical
papers entitled "Virginia and her neigh
bors." Tho leading serial will be "A sin
gular life" by Mrs. Elizabeth Stuart
Phelps-Wood.

The message begins as usual with a ref
erence to our foreign relations, saying that
all history and our peaceful relations with
other nations at this time demonstrate the
advantage of adhering to a foreign policy
free fiom envious national schemes and
characterized by entire honesty and sincer
ity. Exception is made In tho case of Bel
glum, relating to restrictions on Importa
tion of our food products.
Reference is made to the strengthening
of our naval force at Rio do Janeiro dur
ing the late war, which tended to avert
complications which at times seemed Im
minent. Although the war between China and
Japan endangers no policy of the United
States, it deserves grave consideration, by
reason of its disturbance of our growing
commercial interests in the countries and
to increased dangers which may result to
our citizens there.
Deploring the war and anxious for tho
preservation of our commercial interests
there, and for the safety of our citizens, I
would not hesitate to heed any intimation
that our friendly aid in this matter would
be acceptable.
-fter mention of the murder of Wilson,
the American, in Nicaragua, and the un
fortunate termination of the affair, the
message goes on to state that Nicaragua
has given notice of the forfeiture of her
connection with the concession to the canal
company on grounds purely technical and
not embraced in the contract.
A new commercial treaty with Mexico
is recommended and expressions of good
will toward Russia are made. Tho refusal
of Spain to pay tho settled Mora claim is
called to the attention of Congress.
Our relations with France continue such
as should exist between nations so long
bound together. It is hoped Germany will
soon be convinced that inhibition of Amer
ican live stock and meats is needless.
Germany protested against the discrim
ination In the duty on sugars from coun
tries paying an export bounty. In the in
terest of both countries and to avoid accu
sation of treaty violations I recommend
the repeal of that duty.
Payment of the award in the Bering sea
tribunal is recommended.
llnAtnli, rVlcai'n;ilii mill .Siimtiit.
Hawaii is referred to by a statement that
"the" organization of a government in place
of tho provisional arrangement which fol
lowed the deposition of the queen has been
announced, with evidence of its effective
operation. The recognition usual In such
cases has been accorded the new govern
ment." The Japanese empire of today is
no longer the Japanese of the past, and
our relations with this progressive nation
should not be les broad and liberal than
those with other powers.
The President describes the disturbance
at Bluelields, and gives the reason for sta
tioning two of our naval ships there. The
S.imoan question is refeired to as not be
ing in a favorable condition, so far as peice
is concerned, which is not likely to last.
The President suggests that tho United
States should withdraw from any connec
tion with the trouble.
Our FlnuiK'Inl Stitiiillii'r.
The secretary of tho treasury reports re
ceipts from all sources for the fiscal year
ending in June as S-:!7--',S0'.,,-10S, and ex
penditures as ?-t4-2,OOTj,7."iS. There was a
decrease of $15,0.'J,0" I In the ordinary ex
penses of the government compared with
180:5. There was collected from customs
?.i:U,31S,o:j0, internal revenue $U7,ltiS,
140, and the balance of the income was
derived from sales of land and other
sources. It is estimated that upon tho ba
sis of tho present revenue laws tho receipts
for tho fiscal year will be $424,427,7-48, and
the expenditures $444,427, 74S. On Nov. 1,
the total stock money of all kinds In tho
country was f 2,240,7715,888, against $2,
224,0.11,000 on Nov. 1, 1803. The money
of all kinds in circulation or not included
in tho treasury holdings was $1, 072,003,
422, or $24.27 per capita.
Fifty national banks were organized in
the year ending in October, with a capital
of $;i,285,000 ; 70, with a capital of $10,
475,000, went into voluntary liquidation;
21, with a capital of $2,770,000 were placed
in the hands of receivers; total number in
existence October 31 was 3750, being 400
less than in 1803.
While the maximum legal strength of
the army is 25,000, the effective strength
through various causes Is but little over
20,000. While no considerable increase in
tho army In my judgment Is demanded,
tho effective strength of the army should
now bo made at least tho legal strength.
Tho message speaks highly of the work of
the troops in the lato strikes. The total
expenditure for tho war department for tho
fiscal year was In round numbers $50,000.
Tho report of the attorney general notes
tho gratifying progress made by tho su
premo court In overcoming the arrears of
Its business and In reaching a condition in
which it will bo able to dispose of cases as
they arise without any unreasonable delay.
This result Is very largely due to the suc
cessful working of tho plan Inaugurating
circuit courts of appeals. In respect to
those tribunals the suggestion is made that
an additional circuit judge for each circuit
would greatly strengthen these courts.
Federal court for the Iudian territory Is
recommended, the settlement of tho Un
ion Pacific railroad case urged, and a Unit
ed States prison recommended.
The I-ngt-Oflicti Ile-ini'tmnit Should Jte

Tho receipts of tho post-ofllce depart
ment during tho year amounted to $75,
OSO,470.04 and tho expenditures to $84,
224,414.15. Tho deficiency in this depart
ment is unnecessary. Pretended newspa
pers are started by business houses for tho
mere purpose of advertising goods, corn-
Baking
Powder
plying with the law In form only, and dis
continuing tho publication as soon as the
period of advertising is over. "Sample
copies" of pretended newspapers are Is
sued In great numbers for a like purpose
only. The result is a great loss of reve
nue, to tho government besides Its humili
ating use as an agency to aid in carrying
out tho scheme of a business house to tl
vertiso its goods by means of a trick upon
both Its rival houses and the regular .and
legitimate newspapers. Paper-covered lit
erature, consisting mainly of trashy nov
els, to tho extent of many thousands of
tons, Is sent through the mails at one cent
per pound, while the publishers of stand
ard works are required to pay eight times
that amount In sending their publications.
Another abuse consists in the free carriage
through the malls of hundreds of tons of
seed and grain uselessly distributed through
the department of agriculture.
Tho postmaster general predict) that if
the law be so amended as to eradicate these
abuses, not only will the post-ofiico depart
ment show no deficiency, but he believes
that in the near future all legitimate news
papers and periodical magazines might be
properly transmitted through tho mails to
their subscribers free of cost. I invite your
prompt consideration of this subject, and
fully indoise the views of the postmaster
general.
There are now connected with the post
office establishment 32,001 employes, who
are In tho classified service. Another year's
experience serves to strengthen tho convic
tion as to the excellent working of tho civ
il sprvlco law in tills branch of tho public
service.
Our IVeiv IVnvy.
Gratifying progress has been made in
tho construction of ships forour new navy.
All the vessels now building, including the
three torpedo boats authorized at the last
session of Congress and excepting tho
first-class battleship Iowa, will probably
be completed during tho coming fiscal year.
The estimates for tho increase of tho navy
for the year ending June 30, 1890, are
large $12,000,000 but thoy include prac
tically the entire sum necessary to com
plete and equip all the new ships not now
in commission. Attention is called to the
secretary's recommen lation for three addi
tional battleships and 10 to 12 torpedo
boats, and for a supply of ordnance for the
auxiliary lieet.
The l'lihllc I.iiiiiIh mill Hie Iiiitlim Prob
lem. In commenting on the work of tho Inte
rior department the President says the
public land disposed of during the year
amounted to 10,400,100.77 acres, including
28,870.05 of Indian lands. It is estimated
that tho public domain still remaining
amounts to a little more than (100,000,000
acres, excluding, however, about 300,000,
000 acres in Alaska as well as military res
ervations anil railroad and other selections
of lands yet unadjudicated. The total cash
receipts from sales of lands amounted to
$2,074,285.70, including $01,081.03 receiv
ed for Indian lands.
There should be adequato protection for
our forest reserves and a comprehensive
forestry system should be inaugurated.
There should be an abandonment of the
policy sanctioned by present laws, under
which tho government for a very small
consideration is rapidly losing title to im
mense tracts of land covered with timber
which should be properly reserved as per
manent sources of timber supply. A land
court to bear litigated cases growing out
of attempts to obtain government land is
recommended.
Though the condition of the Indians
shows a steady and healthy progress, their
situation is not satisfactory at all points.
Some of them to whom allotments of land
have been made are found to be unable or
disinclined to follow agricultural pursuits
or to otherwise beneficially manage their
land. Tho proper solution of the Indian
problem and the success of every step taken
in that direction depend to a very large ex
tent upon the Intelligence and honesty of
the reservation agents and the interest
they have In their work. j
Pensions.
4Vt the close of the last fiscal year, on the
30th day of June, 1S04, there were 000,4 14
persons on our pension rolls, being a net
increase of 3532 over the previous year.
Of these pensioners 32,030 are surviving
soldiers of Indian and other wars prior to
the late Civil war, and the widows or rela
tives of such soldiers. Tho remainder,
numbering 037,505, are receiving pensions
on account of tho war of tho Rebellion,
and of these 400,344 are on the rolls under
the authority of tho act of June 27, 1S00,
sometimes called the dependent pension
law.
The total amount expended for pensions
during the year was $130,804,401.05, leav
ing an unexpended balance from tho sum
appropriated of $25,205,712.05. Tho sum
necessary to meet pension expenditures for
tho year ending Juno 30, 1890, is estimated
at $140,000,000. The high tide In pension
payments is expected to be reached tho
coining year. The extensive frauds dis
covered leave no room for the claim that
no purgation of our pension rules are
needed for that continued vigilance and
prompt action are not necessary to the
same end.
An Aiiniiul Aurleullurnl Celiaua.
In the agricultural department a saving
of $000,000, or 23 per cent of the entire ap
propriation, has been effected. Tho ex
ports of agricultural products from tho
United States for tho fiscal year amounted
to $028,303,038, being 72.28 per cent ot
American exports of every description,
and the United Kingdom of Great Britain
took more than fifty-four per cent of all
farm products finding foreign markets.

1 lie President pleads for freo shins, and
says that the ancient provision of our law
denying American registry to ships built
abroad and owned by Americans appears
in the light, of present conditions not only
to bo a failuro for good at every point, but
to be nearer a relic of barbarism than any
thing that exists under tho permission of a
statute of the United States. He earnest
ly recommends its prompt repeal.
The llonil Inane,
The president declares the recent issue
of bonds was made necessary by the reduc
tions of the gold reserve which have been
made under tho resumption act of 1875 in
default of autboilty in tho issue of low rate
snort term bonds. He said that nothing
could be worse than the relations existing
between the currency issued the gold held
for its redemption and the means necessary
to replenish such redemption fund, result
ing in an endless chain constantly deplet
ing the treasury's gold. In addition there
is a statutory declaration of policy to main
tain the party between gold and silver.
The only way for replenishment of the gold
reserve is by Issuinc bonds. Yet Comrress
has declined to authorize the issue of bonds
best suited thereto and there is a disposi
tion to deny both necessity and power for
issue of bonds. The president expresses
himself unwilling to believe anyone is will
ing the government should default in its
obligations or Its finances should be reduced
to a silver basis, and announces that so
long as no provision is made for final re
demption of currency obligations anil o
better authority for bond issues is allowed
than at present, such authority will bo
utilized whenever necessary to maintain
sufficient reserve and In time to save the
country's credit.
lMnn for an "Klastlc. Currency."
Prominent, among the unsatisfactory
features of the banking situation are the
lack of elasticity in the currency circula
tion and its frequent concentration in
financial centres when most needed else
where. The absolute divorce of the gov
ernment from banking is the ideal relation
of the government to currency relation.
Tins condition cannot be immediately
reached, but as a step in that direction and
a means of securing a more elastic curren
cy, the secretary of the treasury presents
a scheme modifying the present banking
laws and providing for the issue of circu
lating notes by state banks free from taxa
tion under certain limitations. The Presi
dent unqualifiedly endorses tho secretary's
proposed changes in the law and brielly
states their prominent features. It is pro
posed to repeal all laws requiring deposit
of national bonds as security for circula
tion, to permit national banks to issue
notes not exceeding 75 per cent of paid up
capital on deposit with the government in
legal tender notes, an amount equalling SO
per cent of notes to be issued, and to pro
vide for a quick increase or reduction of
circulation within the above limits. In
addition a safety fund for the redemption
of notes of failed banks is proposed by a
tax of one-half per cent upon the average
circulation until the fund amounts to five
per cent of the outstanding circulation.
Upon failure tho guarantee fund is to be
paid into the safety fund and notes to bo
paid therefrom, the impairment to bo made
good from available assets and secondly by
assessment among other banks, their con
tribution to constitute a first lien upon the
assets of tho failed bank. The existing
individual liability to stockholders is to bo
retained. To meet expenses a tax of one
half per cent per annum is proposed upon
average notes in circulation. No lixed re
serve need be maintained on account of
deposits. State banks are to bo exempted
from federal taxation where tho secretary
of the treasury and the comptroller are
satisfied that they have not had outstand
ing notes exceeding 75 per cent of paid-up
capital ; that stockholders are individually
liable to the extent of their stock, that tho
liability of banks constitutes said first Hen
on assets, that they have maintained a
guarantee fund in legal tender notes equal
to 30 per cent of outstanding notes, and
have promptly redeemed their notes when
presented. This scheme may possibly bo
Improved in detail bnt furnishes a basis for
great improvement In the present banking
and currency system.
In conclusion the President assures Con
gress that, whether in accordance with his
recommendations or not he will be glad to
cooperate In perfecting any legislation that
tends to the prosperity and welfare of our
country. (Signed)
