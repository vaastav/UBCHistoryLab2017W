Mr. Clark and the Caucus.
Mr. Clark's latest deliverance shows the
very great importance of the coming
democratic caucus, or conference. A tentative
ways and means committee is to be
hosen, a plan agreed upon for revis'ng
the Payne law, and a plan devised for
taking the power of naming the committees
out of the hands of the Speaker and
reposing it in tho House. It is a considerable
program, and much depends upon
1t. Will less than a week's time be necessary
for the work?
The men to frame the new tariff measure
are to be named now in order that
they may get busy at once collecting data.
They will thus have nearly a year in
which to equip themselves. Does this
mean that ihe work of the present tariff
board, and that of the enlarged board the
President has asked for, are to go for
nothing? Is the new ways and means
committee to be its own tariff board?
Will it act only on statistics gathered by
itself, or under its own direction?
As between a bill providing for revision
all along the line, or a bill or bills protiding
lor the schedule-by-schedule revision
now so much discussed, llr. Clark
expresses a preference for the latter. If
the latter is adopted, what schedule or
schedules will be selected for the Initial
move? The wool schedule is vulnerable
l>ecause the President himself has condemned
it. Put is it possible for the
democrats of the next House to frame a
new wool schedule which the democrats
and dissatisfied republicans of the Senate
will accept? Ami would success on
that point alone constitute a suffle'ent
basis for a winning appeal to the country
on the tariff issue in lt>12?
Mr. Clark consents?rather reluctantly,
it would seem?to the proposition that the
House name the committees through a
committee. "The plan meets my approbation.
1 hope it may be worked out so
carefully and wisely as not to demoralize
the House." Evidently "I hae me doots."
But if wisdom fails? If demoralization
follows? The presidential campaign will
be at hand, and blunders are expensive.
January is none too early for consideration
of all this business. The democrats
face a greater problem than in 181)3.
There is the same old tariff question complicated
by many irredeemable campaign
promises, plus the disastrous failure
w hich attended the revision of 18&4. The
country will follow with interest and anxiety
every step taken, and may be swift
in punishing too much or too little undertaken
by those to whom it has so recently
given Its confidence.
"Eli Perkins." .
In his uay and way "Eli Perkins" was a
merry fellow, and had a prosperous
vogue. His gift was slender, but he developed
and worked it to wide entertainment.
Many men of middle life, and
older, will recall his short "pieces for the
papers." dealing drolly with small things
on the surftfte. and causing a smile.
Karely more than a smile. There was
neither deep observation nor side-splitting
mirth in his upside down appraisements
Of men or measures, fads or philosophies.
Occasionally a statesman becomes so
sensitive on the subject of economy that
lie sees designs on the United States
Treasury in every interview that is published
It would be something worth seeing if
Chicago sentiment were to manifest itself
as vigorously against the meat packers
as against an unpopular opera performer.
Japan is getting a great deal of unsolicited
advice concerning strategic possibilities
on the California coast.
A lot of men who are economizing In
other directions will soon be wearing silkembroidered
suspenders.
Mr. Carnegie and Mr. Rockefeller are
at*I contestants for the Santa Clans
stakes.
President Diaz has a neat and effectual
method of handling all resignation rumart.
Parsimony.
L'ncle tJam usually goes about his business
with clear vision and with an excellent
ndm of proportion. He is ordinarily
.egical and foreltanded in his provisions
for the administration of this great business
enterprise styled the United States
of America. He insists upon getting the
best materials for his warships, the best
gans for his soldiers, the best steel and
stone and brick and wood for his public
buildings, the best talent for his military
and naval service*, the best men for his
courts. Ha spares no expense when it
oaea to organising and equipping the
various parts of the executive system. As
a good business man always does, the
gawarament has heretofore regarded wise
liberality aa true economy iu al! that
pertains to the providing of ways and
means of running the affairs of the country.
But Just at present a singular perversion
of thought seems to possess those
responsible for the conduct of governmental
affairs. In the face of a virtually
declining pay scale for the government
workers In ail the grades below department
and bureau chiefs. It Is now planned
to reduce the fores and to make those
remaining 'In service work longer, and
at the same time In some of the departments
curtailing their privileges, such as
the allowance of time for sickness. The
inversion is carried out In the terms 01
the time-extension plan now in prospect.
Half an hour is to be added to the working
period during six months of the year.
Ordinarily one would enpect this addition
to be made during the season
of the longer days, covering th<
summer time. But according to the
present understanding the extra half houi
Is to he exacted during the time when
the days are short, from October to
April, when artificial light is necessary
and when (be working conditions arc
I moat difficult, and when, furthermore, ft
la the least convenient for everybody to
I get to work at an earlier hour,
j It la amaalag that this process should
be carried so far with the consent of the
men of affairs who are at the heads of
I the various departments and who have
had more or less experience In business.
These men presumably know that the government
will not receive as much In valu
I able work from a force so treated as bom
a force which feels contented. They must
know, too. that the Imposition of an additional
half hour in winter In the morning
will occasion a serious upheaval of
{domestic arrangements and cause endless
Jconfuslon which must react upon the
| public service.
J Fortunately, there is time for this
1 amazing proposition of longer hours for
' a smaller force to be considered before It
i is put into effect. The President and his
I tmuuiei umccrs win - nave -a iurmer
I chance to reflect upon the wisdom and
the Justice of at the same time cutting
down the clerical members and calling
upon the department workers for more
labor. In any business establishment
this would be a frank confession of
stringency, strongly suggestive of approaching
bankruptcy. Surely the United
! States is in no such straits as to warrant
the fear on the part of any administrative
official that unless the clerical pay
rolls are cut down by a few score of
thousands of dollars annually, and the
remaining clerks . worked harder than
ever, with fewer privileges, this great
government will go Into the hands of a
receiver.
m III m
II America and Japan.
Our war scares are always made to
j turn on supposed Intentions of Japan.
I Nippon is the enemy. We must keep her
I ever in mind and ever under suspicion.
1 Her professions of friendship are false.
| Her desire to do us injury is earnest and
j deep seated. Iler power to injure us as
: matters stand is enormous. Beware. Get
J ready. Do not be taken by surprise.
Should we lose an important point at the
start we might be piaced at a disadvantage
lasting fcr years.
Particulars in support of this warning?
There are none worth the name. Japan
is no mystery. A very white light has
been beating on her ever since her phenomenal
rise in the world's affairs. Her
army and navy resources are well known.
Her peace plans are widely advertised.
Her manufacturers are busy. Her national
debt is heavy. Death and taxes are as
inevitable and unwelcome in that country
as in any other, east or west. Stated
n an American phrase, Japan has her
hands full.
Not too full to fight, of course, if the
national Interests demanded it, but what
.nterests of hers would be served by a
war with America? What have we done
A Japan, or where is the probable clash
between the two countries, which would
make it advisable for her to Pick a quar
rel with us and strike us upon the instant?
Such a war could not be localised.
Other powers would Inevitably be
drawn in, and it might easily prove to be
iho most protracted and destructive
struggle the world had ever known. Even
if we were taken a little unawares, Japan
could not hope to emerge from such
a contest in a plight promising for her
future, and she might in the end be annihilated.
We need a larger army and a larger
navy, and our coast defenses are pathetically
inadequate. Let us by all
means put ourselves in the proper trim
to meet any and every possible enemy.
But why pick an enemy? Why give the
.mpress!on by anything we do that we
have a particular power in view*, and
chat our preparations are all directed at
her? And why should that power be the
one whose relations with us have always
oeen friendly, and with whom our present
connections are of a most cordial
character? v
Everything we do?and much should be
done?to strengthen ourselves afloat and
ashore will answer as against an attack
from any quarter, Japan Included; but
nothing should be done upon the hypothesis
and with a proclamation that war is
just ahead and we are hurrying for It.
It is but natural for government clerks
to think wonderingly and perhaps resentfully
of large increases of salary which
have been established without any suggestions
of longer hours.
In these scenes of political anxiety Mr.
Loeb continues to devote himself to checking
smugglers and Mr. Hitchcock to going
after the wicked get-rlch-quick man.
The recent appearance of Pennsylvania
avenue was enougli to discourage anybody
from driving a team of mules to
the Capttol.

One difficulty that the new national
! party appears to experience Is that of
getting anything that is really new.
.
i ???
Washington and the People.
Comparatively few members of Congress
realise that all the American people take
a direct interest and teel a pride In
Washington, the National Capital. They
have a way of taking Washington for
granted, as something negligible, somei
thing annoying when legislation is desired,
! and they are disposed in many instances
i to berate the Constitution makers for
I imposing upon them the duty of exercising
exclusive jurisdiction oveh the ten
miles square set apart as a seat of government.
They do not take account of the
immense number of people who annually
visit the District, drawn here by its prestige
as the nation's center and by its
widely advertised attractions. They do
not accurately measure the sentiment felt
throughout the United States for Washington
as a model municipality.
President Ta-ft dwelt at unusual length
in his annual message upon certain needs
of Washington, and whether his recommendations
are honored by Congress at
a v. i ? a 11 ii-. A.. 1, ? a ? !<! a1?>

read and arc now the subject of comment
| on the part of millions of people, who
otherwise would perhaps not have been
! made acquainted with the necessities of
the capital. Couched in terms of a
; presidential message to Congress, these
items become of national Importance, in
keeping with the thought of thv framers
of the Constitution when tney set apart
! a certain district for the government's
! own uses and enjoined Congress to care
! for it.
The Toledo Blade has the following to
say anent the President's remarks about
the alley slum evil in this city:
" 'Beautiful as Washington looks, there
1 is not a city In the Union of its slxe
that ltas fouler alums, or more of them,'
was the recent comment of a visitor at
the National Capital. In his message to
Congress President Taft advocated the
destruction of these eentes of disease
and crlms and the substitution for them
of public playgrounds for the children.
The President has earned the gratitude
of the people of the District of Columbia
and every patriotic citixen of the United
States, for Washington will never be the
grand capital' or modsl municipality its
friends have long dreamed of until its
alley habitations, unlit for human occupancy,
have been torn down and the
i habitues compelled to move to more sanl,
tary and decent quarters."
It is in this spirit that the members Of
i the House and Senate should refjnd t&Mr
%
*
powers sal duties u iocs! lefliktsn. Not
merely in the matter of the alley slums,
hut la all other respects, they are expected
by the people of the country at
' large to do what is necessary to make
the District an Ideal community. The
j hBiertaan people will not begrudge the
comparatively small sums required to
. tneet the District's dollars appropriated
' for such works or the federal dolla. a appropriated
without supplements from the
local tax revenues for the strictly federal
undertakings such as the reclamation of
the pestilential Eastern branch and the
erection of necessary publlg buildings. ;
: stembers of Congress who tnlnk that the j
average citizen disapproves of wise liberality
In the development and maintenance
of the National Capital have mis- [V
taken the-spirit of the people. ?

Our Useful Army.
From tUe New York Mall.
That an army is a good thing to have
on hand even in time of peace was conclusively
shown during the great forest
fires that swept over Placer and Nevada
counties in California in the late summer
of this year. The fires got beyond
the control of local agencies, and on request
from the residents the War Department
detailed two companies of
Coast Artillery, the 00th and the 147th.
from the Department of California, to
fight the flames. Those two companies
were on duty in the fire zone from August _
23 until September 9, and during that
period they marched from thirty-five to a
forty-six miles a day. climbing one moun- tain
5,000 feet high In twenty-four hours,
another of 4.000 feet in eleven hours, successfully
fighting blazing forests nearly
every step of the way. The efforts of
those soldiers saved half a dozen lives
and property valued at several millions of
dollars. All this as a reminder that the
army has a little conservation policy of
its own which, when occasion requires,
becomes effective.

Ideal Winter Weather.
From tbe Baltimore Erenlng 8uo.
Boasting is always dangerous bust
ness, yet the temptation to say something
about the weather we are having
today is too enticing to resist, ii
A cloudless sky, an ail- that lnvlgorates
but does not bite, a quickstep
march In the pulses of every man
that paces tho streets?this is ideal '>SJ
winter weather. It has suggestions of
Christmas and the Christmas spirit
in it. Last night the full moon, from
a sky flecked with light clouds, looked
down on jolly coasting parties; on
lakes tilled with joyous skaters; on
white-coated. blue-shadowed lawns
and fields of tho suburbs and parks.
It tilled the air with a mystical radiance
and made tremulous the hearts
of the more sensitive onlookers.
After all. beauty is the one great
fact of life, and thoee who miss it
find nothing to compensate for it. The
wise man will make much of this incomparable
season.
Democracy's First Test.
From the Now York World.
The people of New York do not want a'
corporation mach.ne senator in place of j
Chauncey M. Depew. The people of New t
Jersey do not want a corporation ma-:
chine senator in place of John Kean.
The people of Ohio do not want a corporation
machine senator* in place of
Charles Dick- The democratic party as ?
a whole wants no such senators. The
country wants no such senators. It al- "~
ready has too many of them. It Is folly
for democratic leaders to talk about redeeming
the campaign pledges if they do
not put men In office who can be trusted
to redeem thoee pledges. The first na- '
ttonal -test of a rehabilitated democratic 5!
party will come in the election of United E
States senators in these three states. If 5!
senators are not elected who can com- a
mend public confidence the damage will
be almost irreparable,
