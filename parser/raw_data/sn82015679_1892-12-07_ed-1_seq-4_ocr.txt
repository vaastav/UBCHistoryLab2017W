TnEKE is a great deal nioro cheerful
contentment in tho Republican than in
tho Democratic camp to-day.
Democratic papers will denounce the
President's message as "a partisan ha
rangue7' because it set3 forth the pros
perous condition of the country.
The Republicans in Congress owo no
sort of consideration to the silvcritcs,
tut they owe it to tho country to take
the initiative in repealing the silver cot
Of 1890.
Trie name of the street commissioner
of this city docs not appear among those
who are to address tho road congress.
There is no reason to believe ho is in
favor of good roads.
Tun facts and figures in the' Presi
dent's message showing the general
prosperity of the country will doubtless
be bitterly assailed by tho Democratic
press, but they am true all the samo.
Four years hence, if the Democrats
keep their pledges, will Mr. Cloveland
be able to make the statement about the
general prosperity of the country and
sustain it with facts as has President
Harrison In his message?
The reason that gold is going abroad
is that Russia and Austria are paying
a premium for it tho former to have it
on hand in caso of war and the latter as
tho basis of specie payments but there
i3 nothing to fear so long as the balance
of trade is in our favor.
The Democratic member of the House
tvho made hasto to present a bill author
izing a loan to provide for & deficiency
in the treasury should have waited until
the report of the Secretary of tho Treas
ury was presented, which shows no de
ficiency the present fiscal year.
Among other evidences of national
prosperity the President cites tho fact
that tho number of depositors in sav
ings banks in this country increased
from C93,S70 in 1SG0 to 4.258,893 in 1690.
There is not 'much sign of the poor
growing poorer in those figures.
, The threat of the steamship agents to
the effect that if immigrants are not
permitted to come direct to this country
they can be landed in Canada and make
their way hero, leads to tho suspicion
that foreign ship-owners think they have
a first mortgage on the United States.-
President IIakuisox never com
mended himself to railroad corporations
by his interest in railroad, employes,
Lut, regardless of this, ho for tho fourth
timo recommends legislation for the
benefit of this class of citizens. If Con
gress neglects to give them protection
it is surely not his fault.
It must bo gratifying to Democrats,
now that they have discovered that their
voting the Populist ticket in States like
Kansas, Nebraska, Colorado, etc, was
not necessary in order to throw the elec
tion into the House, to havo themselves
counted by tho Weaver managers as a
part of their aggregate voto.
TnE road congress was well opened
yesterday, tho attendance being unex
pectedly large. It; is evident tho timo
is ripo for tho formulation of public
eentiment in some very progressive ac
tion on this eubject. It should be tho
aim of the present congress to give
practical shape to its conclusions.
It is Quito in keeping with tho gen
eral system of official plunder that pre
vails in Marion county affairs that the

autopsy on tho county and be done

ing to destroy tho Union, becauso they
were sixty days or two years in the
Mexican war. the less said by those who
are responsible for that extension about
'tho pension roll being tho roll of hon
or," tho better.
Wiiat tho President has to say re
garding pensions will not meet tho ap
proval of tho frc c-trado editor any more
than his declaration of tho danger of tho
6400,000,000 of Southern war claims now
pending will please tho ex-confederates,
but it will comfort thousands of men
throughout tho North who'bear him in
affectionate remembrance because ho
always recalls them as comrades.
: The Soldiers Monument Commission
ers seem determined to carry out their
policy of diverting tho monument from

At their meeting yesterday they decided

paigns of Vincennes and Tippecanoe.
If th surviving soldiers of tho war for
the Union do not find some way to prevent
tho consummation of this outrage they

THE PBESIDE3X' HE63AGE.
President Harrison's last annual mes
sage is a comprehensive rovicw of tho
condition of the country and the affairs
of the government. Its key-note is
found in the opening sentence, in which
the President ex- rt sses his great satis
faction "in being able to say' that tho
general conditions affecting tho com
mercial and industrial interests of the
United States arc in tho highest degree
favorable." This statement is followed
by a presentation of facts , which fully
support it. While many of these facts
havo been statod before, they havo
never been grouped together as effect
ively or massed in so forceful a manner.
As presented by the President they fur
nish a picture of national progress and
prosperity that ought to be exceedingly
gratifying to every true American.
Whatever may bo tho cause of this
national progress and prosperity, all
patriotic Americans should rejoice that
it has prevailed and still exists. As for
President Harrison, ho does not hesitate
to declare his belief that one of its
primo causes has been tho protective
tariff policy. "1 believe," ho says, "that
tho protective tariff system,' which vhas
tow for something more than thirty
years continuously prevailed in our
legislation, has been a mighty instru
ment for the development of our na
tional wealth, and a most powerful
agency in protecting the homes of our
workingmenfrom tho invasion of waut."
No one who knows President Harrison
would believe for a moment that he
would reconstruct his principles on ac
count of a political defeat. The ex
pression abovo quoted shows that ho
does not propose to take any backward
step or relinquish an iota of his convic
tion that the protection of American in
dustries is the true American policy.
Tho President accepts tho result of
tho recent election to the fullest extent
as a popular expression in favor of a
now policy and a tariff for revenue only.
Ho takes the successful party at its
word. "We must assume," ho says,
"that the present tariff, constructed
upon the lines of protection, is to bo re
pealed, and that there is to bo substi-,
tuted for it. a tariff law constructed
solely with reference to revenue; that
no duty is to-bo higher, becauso the in
crease will keep open an American mill
or keep up the wages of an American
workman, but that in every caso such a
rate of duty is to be imposed as will
bring the treasury of the United
States the largest returns of rev
enue. The contention has not
been between schedules, .but between
principles, and it would be offensive to
suggest that tho prevailing party will
not carry into legislation the principles
advocated by it and the pledges given
to the people.' In accordance with this
view, tho President recommends that
the wholo subject of tariff rovision be
left to the next Congress, and expresses
tho hope, though with evident misgiv
ings, that whatever it may do will inure
to the prosperity of the country and tho
benefit of wage-workers.
The remainder of tho message is de
voted to" a review of our foreign rela
tions, the reports of tho heads of depart
ments, our merchant marine, and other
matters. The gratifying results of reci
procity are set forth very clearly, and
the financial policy of his administration
is fully vindicated.
The message, like all of President
Harrison's papers, is thoroughly Ameri
can in torio, and will increase tho popu
lar estimate of his patriotism, his grasp
of public affairs and his conscientious
devotion to duty.
THE PBOHIBITIOU OP IifLUGRATIOK'.
Strong reasons can bo adduced in fa
vor of tho proposition of the Senate
committee to prohibit all immigration
for one year." Consideration of the re
strictions proposed to be imposed after
' that period may bo postponed, but the
Journal is decidedly of the opinion that
a strict embargo should be placed on all
immigration for at least that length of
time. Tho hygienic argument, if there
were no other, would iustfysuch action.
It is about as certain as anything can bo
in tho future that the cholera will be
found knocking at our doors next year.
All past experience with the pes
tilence proves that it makes its ap
pearance one year, getting a slight foot
hold, and renows the attack tho next
year in much more dangerous and ag
gressive form. Tho cholera is not
stamped out in Europe It is only rest
ing during the winter. With unre
stricted immigration next year it will bo
almost impossible to keep it out of this
country. Of course, wo can establish a
quarantine, but that is only a partial
defense. Why not strike nt the root of
the matter by prohibiting immigration
altogether! Cholera is not an American
disease, and if it can be kept out of tho
country there is no danger of its appear
ing hero. It never has appeared here
except by importation amongimmigrants
from other countries. As tho exclusion
of these almost certainly means tho ex
clusion of cholera, it really seems as if
Congress ought not to hesitate to act.
Other strong reasons in favqrof tho
proposed measuro are found in its prob
able effect on social and economic con
ditions. Thcro is reason to believe it
would have a decidedly beneficial influ
ence in mitigating somo of the irritating ,
features of our present social condition.
There is a growing opinion that the for
eign element of our population is al
ready as largo as wo can 6afely carry
and assimilate. The steady inllux of
immigrants has proved a disturbing
factor in the solution of the labor ques
tion, and justice to our own peoplo de
mands that an attempt be mado to pro
tect them, at least for a time, againstfur
ther disturbance from tho samo source.
This would bo true even if the foreign
immigrants now coming hither were all
of a desirable class, but it is well known
that a large proportion are not. For
some years past, owing to cheap trans
portation and the, competition of rail
road and steamship companies, tho
quality of foroign immigration has been
steadily deteriorating. It is notorious,
also, that many paupers and criminals
have been sent hither by the authorities
of different European countries. It is
bad enough to have our labor market,
already overstocked, still fnrther glut
ted by a steady influx of foreigners, but
it is far more alarming to contemplate
the rapid increase of our criminals and
paupers from tho same cause. Ex-President
Hayes, in an address before the
National Prison-reform Association at
Baltimore, on Saturday, expressed the
opinion that the immigration wo are
now receiving is poisoning tho body
politic. We quote from tho report of
his address in the Sunday Journal:
I tn migration, as it exists to-day. is the
lion iu tbe path of the progress of America.
A high antbority places the number of
criminal and defective classes iu the United
States at ooe in one hundred of tho total
population. Consider the awful sicnili
rance of an increase of our criminal popu
lation in aslngledecade of many thousands
by emigration from Europe alone. For
merly the lovo of liberty and the laudable
desire to better tbe condition were the
leadintr motives ot emigration from Europe
to America. Now employers of large bodies
of men, wanting cheaper labor, the agents
of steamship companies, speculators in laud
in the thinly-nettled States, stimulated br
their greed for gain, aod, worst? than all,
the increasing etlorts of the European com
munities to send to America their chronio
paupers, lunatics and criminals, have given
to this question a gravity that has not be
fore belonged to it.
In the opinion of the Journal this is
one of the mostimportantqnestions now
before tho country, and one in which
health boards, workingmen and social
reformers should make common cause.
The American people, irrespective of
party, should demand of Congress tho
total prohibition of foreign immigra
tion for at least one year, and at the ex
piration of that period, if the measure
meets public expectation, it should be
extended.
I li DEFINITE K0TI0K8 OP CITIZENSHIP.
The story in yesterday's paper of the
experiences of Jacob Gerber, a Hebrew
subject of Russia, reveals the weakness
of tho provision of many Western
States by which an alien can exercise
the right of suffrago beforo he becomes
a citizen of the United States. Gerbei
had taken out his first papers in Omaha,
and probably had voted. The fact of
voting led him to infer that ho had been
made a citizen of the United States,
with all that the term implies, when, as
a matter of fact, he had simply declared
his intentions to do so when ho had
been a resident of this country the
period required by tho laws of the
United States. Having evidence of his
declaration of intention with him, Ger
ber left for Russia, to find thcro that ho
was no mora an American citizen than
he was when he immigrated. Conse
quently he was arrested by tho Russian
authorities and subjected to great
hardship. Possibly he arrogantly as
sumed his superiority as an alleged
American citizen to the Russian officials,
who, when they found that he was not,
took their revenge. Mr. Gerber appears
to be a man of more intelligence than
most immigrants from that country, and
tho fact that ho was possessed of consid
erable property goes to sustain that as
sumption; yet he did not understand tho
laws of the country relative to naturali
zation. He had only applied for citizen
ship, and yet thought he was full
fledged. There aro tens of thousands
of such cases. They have been taken to
a court and have gone through with n
form concerning which'they havo no in
telligent conception. They are taken to
tho polls and vote, and will continuo to
vote. In this State such persons' right
to vote without beingcitizens continues
until the time for taking out naturali
zation papers, but ceases thereafter.
How often is this requirement ob-
Bervedl Again, Gerber was allowed
to declare his intentions of citi-
zenshiD whilo his family was yet
in Russia. Before a man is allowed to
become a citizen he must havo been a
resident of the United States a period of
five years. Is he a lonafide resident if
he has a family living in Russia? In nil
tho States a married roan's voting resi
dence is where his family resides. But
here it appears that an alien, with a
family in Rpssia, is permitted to take
out first papers, and, if ho should re
main here five years, to become a citi
zen in full, whilo his family residence is
iu another country. There seems to bo
danger that citizenship will not only bo
corao indefinite and cheap untfer such
lax regulations, but that it may get us
into difilculty when men come here to
get citizenship in ordor to escape alle
giance to the government under which
they were born, and at the same timo
all responsibility to tho government of
tho United States. Not a few cases
havo been found where foreigners have
secured American citizenship for that
purpose.

Washington, Dec. 6. President Harri
son's last annual message to Congress wus
awaited to-day with more interest and
curiosity than usually meots tho delivery
of this state paper. It is safe to say that
every member of Congress, in both branches
and of all parties, was intensely
eager to learn in what manner
the . President would treat tho two
public questions which, more than any
others, are popularly-supposed to have
cansed a verdict at the polls reversing
the policy of the government which has
been in successful and prosperous opera
tion for more than a goneration. Almost
no information as to what President Har
rison Would . say upon these sub
jects of the turift nnd of
the equality of voters at federal elections
had leaked out, and consequently last
night and this morning speculation as to
the message was everywhere rife. For
these reasons there was an unusually large
attendance in both the House and tbe
Senate when the executive mes
sage was delivered, soon after
tbis noon, and for the same reason
the reading of tho message by the clerks
received the closest attention and was
carefully followed by members on both
sides of each chamber who had been sup
plied with printed copies.
The President's attitude on the tariil and
upon tho necessity of legislation
to protect the purity of the
ballot was the one . theme of
conversation after adjournment, which im
mediately followed tho reading of the mes
sage. It was notable that for once there
was absolutely no disagreement among the
parti' of the administration as to the skill
and wisdom with which the Presi
dept has treated not only both
of these topics, bat also the opera
tions of tbe various departments. Usually
a President's message is followed by moro
or less criticism from individual members
of the party in sympathy with tbe execu
tive, based upon details of recommended
legislation as they may ailect diUerent
local ideas. To-day, however, not a single
Republican could be found who was not
enthusiastic and unreserved in his com
mendation of everything that President
Harrison had written to Cdugress.
STATISTICS FOR DEMOCRACY TO STUDY.
The Array of statistics with .which the
message appeared was accepted as an ab
solutely accurate statistical 1 standard by
which the effect upon tbe industrial and
linanoial history of tho conutry, of the
future policy of tbe party .which
will enter into full control of
the government next March, could be
measured. It. was especially noted that
President Harrison seemed to have made
this his main effort in constructing his mes

Sherman and Paddock, as a landmark from
which tbe Democracy must take it depart
ure on its voyage into the sea of disagree
ment and uncertainty which confronts its
polioien. The message .wa received
by the Democratic members with
evident seriousness. Its paragraphs
somewhat tinged with sarcasm, '
which set before the party lead
ers soon to come into power the hose
task they bad undertaken of keeping their
pledges to the people uud at tho same time
maintaining tho American wages, tbe em
ployment of labor and a continuous de
crease ot the cost of living, impressed both
demagogues and statesmen with a new
sense of responsibility and realization
of the stormy future before them. The
President's attitude upon the 'question of
federal elections proved to be eo calm, dig
nified and patriotic as to command there
speoioftho thoughtful among the Demo
crats and enlisted tbe entnuiaetic support '
of such Republicans as havehalted on this
platform.
Tbe President's recommendation that
tariil legislation be left to the next Con
gress is wholly in accord with tho policy
favored by practically all the Republican
members of tbe iSsnate. and at the same
tine it is noticed here that the President's
expression of regret that the framing of
the new tarilf policy must be postponed
does not make less difficult of solution the
problem of an extra session which con
fronts his successor.
It is observed that the President's recom
mendations upon all important subjects of
legislation are purely general in charactor,
and, with tbe single exception of immigra
tion, aro not likely to have any immediate
bearing upon tbe proceedings of this ses
sion, lie expressly refrains from any
recommendation upon tbe silver ques
tion, because of tho current session
ot tho international monetary , con
feronco. but be does vigorously
urge the necessity of restricting immigra
tion. Hissummary of the work of tbo de
partments, which necessarily covevs tbe
entire period of bis administration, is re
garded, in its mere recital of facts, as a
record ot things accomplished which will
invito and defy competition during tho
next four years.
REPHE8ENTATIVK JOIIXSOX'S VIEWS.
Hon. Henry U. Johnson, the only one of
Indiana's two Republican Congressmen in
tbe city, said' to tho Journal correspondent
to-night: "The message of the President
is an admirable document throughout. It
is evident in reading it that ho has not, in
defeat, abated anything of his convictions.
It is an encouragement to such of bis
countrymen as share his political belief,
nnd is an inspiration to all Americans in
the splendid showing it makes of tho na
tional progress and prosperity. Ho bas
certainly succeeded, by the picture be has
drawn of our condition as a people, in di
recting tbe attention of the Democratio
leaders to the magnitude of the interests
which are so soon to be committed to their
hands. There was no need of the express
declaration, near tbe conclusion of- tbe
message, that tbe view of our national af-.
fairs therein presented would serve as a
level from wbjch to note the changes that
might be wrought by future legislation. It
is sufficiently apparent from the very tirst
sentence that it was the Presiden't purposo
by summarizing therein tbe achievements
of Republican rulo to erect a standard for
future comparison by his message, ai4d also
to invite the opposition to make compari
sons possible by enacting into laws tho
pledges which they made the people in
order to get into power.
"Although be disavows any purpose to
discuss the tariff, he bas, nevertheless,
made a masterly presentation of the is.uo
from tbelaborstand-point. and has ulo pre
sented tbe reciprocity phase ot tbe subject
with great Mioeinctnees, and power. His
statement that the tarilf contention
between the two arcat parties at the
recent election was not simply over
schedule,.-but was a struggle over
principles, and his recommendatiou
that all tariff legislation be deferred
until the Fifty-third Congress assembles
aro very happy and timely. These utter
ances will serve to emphasize more than
ever the character of the tariil diilerences
botweeu the two parties. If this disagree
ment was simply one as to the rate of tbe
duty to be imposed tariff leaislat ion might,
with proprioty. be urged at tbe present ses
sion of Congress, though tbo House
is Democratio and the Senate Republican,
since even protectionists dider as to tbe
amount of duty required. ButtbedtnVrence
is as to the method of imposing the duty.
This, of course, makes tarinT legislation out
of the question this session, and the Presi
dent well suggests that those who unite in
tbe opinion that all duties should be Im
posed on articles the like of which are not
produced on our soil shall take upon their
own shoulders tbo responsibility of enact
ing legislation of that character.
"The statement us to the coudition of tbe
tieasury comes with all tho force of ao ex
catnedra utterance, and will do much to
reassure those persona who have been led
by loose and irresponsible campaign
speeches and literature to believe that
there is an existing or irapendiug deficit
there.
"Perhaps the most commendable
and patriotio thing in the wholo
message is the President's declaration
with respect to free elections. It is
coached in language wholly impersonal
and entirely free from any appearance of
partisan feeling, and yet is so forcibly and
impressively expressed tbat it cannot fail
to arrest the thoughtful attention of nieu
of all parties. This questiou is in my
opinion of overshadowing importance.
Tho evil to which the President adverts is
not conl.nad entirely to any one party nnd
is growiutxcoutinnaily. Unless its progress
is arrested it will inevitably result in con
sequences of the roost grave and disastrous
character. The President deserves great
praisa for the earnestness and persistency
with which bo has always pointed out tbis
danger and warned bisoouutry against it."
FCEXK8 IN 1 II K SKNATit AND HOUSE.
The press dispatches, in describing the
scenes in Congress during the reading of
the President's message, say that the com
mercial and business statistics given in the
first part of the document,' and tbe sarcas
tic paragraphs as to tbe supposed effects of
a tariil for revenue seemed to meet genera!
approval on tho Republican side of the
Senate chamber. During the reading some
of the Democratic Senators held tbo
printed copy of the message m their
bands and followed its reading with Atten
tion. This was peculiarly noticeable in
tbe caso of Mr. Cockrell, of Missouri,
who studied tbe ticurea presontcdllwith
close care. Mr. Mct'hcrson, of New Jersey,
moved down to the front rank so as to bo
within hearing, and Mr. Palmer, of Illinois,
took a position on tbe Kepublicau side, oc
cupying Mr. Frye's seat in tbo front row to
escape the buzz of conversation which in
tervened between bis customary seat and
the clerk's desk. When Mr. Fry e caino in
he changed over to a place of equal ad
vantage on' tbe other side of .the
aisle. Noticeable from the custom
ary reading of the message was the
fact of the general close attention.
The affairs of the State Department, which
has no other way of communicating with
Congress, is usually given precedence and
tbe subordination of them in the Presi
dent's last messaize to the tariil was quick
ly noticed. There was a preceptible in
crease of interest when thoso passages re
lating to relations with Canada was
reached. Mr. Cullom, of ' Illinois, ex
changed whispered comments with bis
neighbor, Mr. Dixon, of Rhode Island,
Senators Sherman and ' Morirnn,
tbe two chiefs of " tbe lor
eign relations committee. listened
attentively, and Mr. Hoar dropped tbe
newspaper ho had been looking at and fol
lowed the reading closely. Ex-Speaker
Reed dropped in while tho reading was go
ing on. aod heard the message read in the
Senate instead of in the House. The read
ing of tbe message occupied about an hour
ami a half. At its close Mr. Manderbon,
chairman of the committee on printiug,
o tit-red u resolution for printing ten thou
sand copies for distribution to Senators,
and tbis was agreed to.
The reading of the message in the House
met with little attention. Many of the
members left tbo hall, preferring to stndr
the recommendations of tbe President at
their leisure at home. Those who re
mained entered into conversation or de
voted themselves to a perusal of the news
papers. There were a few exceptions to
the general rule. Mr. Hooker, of Missis
sippi, wus an interested listener from be
ginning to end. He left his Heat in the rear
of the chamber and occupied a desk direct
ly in front of the Speaker's chair and
paid the closest attention. For a short
time he had as his companions Messrs.
Herbert of Alabama. Diugley of Mai no
aud flutter and Dollivcr of Iowa. When
the question of the tariff was reached, Mr.
McMillin, of Tennessee, strolled down one
of the aisles and listened intently, but his
criticism of that portion was a mere smile.
He then resumed his seat and paid no
further attention to the message. Tho dis
cussion of thelndiau question arrested tbo
attention of Mr. Simpson, of Kansas, for a
few momentr; and he then turned to him
colleague, Mr. Otis, and thereafter heard
no word of the message. An hour and a
half was consumed in tbe reading of tbe
message, which was then, on motion of Mr.
McMillin, of Tennessee, referred to the
committee of the whole.
Comment of the London Pre.
London, Deo. 4. In commenting on
President Harrison's message I the Morning
Post says: "A perusal of Mr. Harrison's
message suggests rather the dogel
courage of a gladiator than the foresiuht
of a statesman. It is eingnlarly character
istic' of his community that the retiring
President linds it consistent with his posi
tion to indulge in a flourish of impotent
nienaco against Canada."
The Daily .News says that much atten
tion need not be paid to President Harri
son's reference to Canada.
ItOOSEVELT'S COBI31ISSIOX.
Extenston of the Civil Service Urged Prac
tice of Assessing for Political Purposes.
Washington, Dee. 6. The United States
Civil-service Commission to-day made
publio its ninth report to the President, It
shows that from July 1, 1601, to Jane 30,
ItOX the whole number of applicants exam
ined for tho five. branches of the classified
service was 19. 4 CO, of which 1'i.ltX) passed
and 7,300 failed to pass. Compared with
the previous year thin shows an increase of
SDj in the whole number examined, a de
crease in the wholo number who pas.ed of
b'0, and an increase in tho whole number
who tailed to pass of 1,012. Tho whole
number appointed iu the year covered by
this report is as follows: Departmental
service, 4't: customs service, 161; postal
service, 2.11S; railway mall service, X.IJW,
and Indian service, 10, making a total of
3,yui, a decrease of 1,134 over tbe previous
year.
Of political assessments, the report says:
"This is the first time the Civil-service
Commission bas, in the midst of a presi
dential campaign, actively interfered to
prevent tbe collection of these assessments,
and it believes its action bad a most ben
eficial ellect. and that there was much less
assessing done than ever before, although
it cannot be doubted that, a it was,
altogether too much took place. In tbe
opinion of the commission this practice
will not be wholly broken np until it is
made a penal offense for any person what
soever to solicit a political contribution
from a government employe in any place
whatsoever." The commission calls at
tention to the systematic etlorts made
in various States to collect
assessments from governmmt employes.
Jn all the cases it promptly published the
facts in full, and handed the testimony
over to tho Attorney-general. The com
mission declares that the classified service
should be extended as rapidly as practica
ble, as. lor instance, to dorks and writers
in tho cavyyaids, to the internal revenue
service, to custom-houses with twentv
five employes, and to free-delivery post
offices. The report continues: 'The Na
tional Letter-carriers' Association, acting
in its capacity of a branch of the Knights
of Labor, has recommended that all free
delivery offices be chisnibed. The lerter
carriers are just like other American citi
zens. They want to feel that when thy
do tbe work of the public honestly, zeal
ously and intelligently, they should not be
made the sport ot local political bosses."
The commission also urges the adoption
of a new classification of the customs and
postal services and a modification of the
rule. o tbat the number of excepted
places and of places nubjoct to non-com-petitne
examination nay be greatly re
duced in all branches f the service. The
commission thinks that "tbe exceptions
lroui examination in any postoffice may be
properly limited to the postmaster, assist

She preferred to go to the ante-room of the

tbey appealed to the appointment clerk,
and he tried to persuade her to leave.
"No." sho insisted. "1 prefer to starve)

STOCKADES OF TfSKS.
A Century's Supply of Ivory Heaped Up la
the Interior of Africa.
Washington, Dec. a "The ivory trade
shows a most reiuarkabio increase," Com
mercial Agent Mohuu writes from the Con
go to tho Stato Department, "Ivory is
the most valuable article exported. It all
comes from tbe High Congo, both north
and south of the river. Steamers bring it
as far as Stanley Pool, and from there to
Matadi (-50 miles) native carriers bring it
ea their backs. I have seen iu one day
five hundred carriers come iuto Matadi,
each man carrying a tusk averaging sixty
livo pounds in weiizht. When tusks weigh
two hundred pounds, which not infre
quently happens, four men carry them.
Most ot the ivory wiow coming
down is known as Mead ivory.' Some of
tho elephants from which tbeso tusks
came were killed one hundred years ago,
and the kings of villages have been storing
it. placing the last tusks brought iu ou top
of the pile, and when they required somo
goods from the coast-traders the tusks
from the bottom layers wero taken. This
system has prevailed for years, and it
is estimated that there is enough ivory
stored iu the anterior to supply the
world for lbe? next century. It is
estimated, but' ipon wbofie authority
J cannot discover, that there are still at
least two hundred thousand elephants in
central Africa. The only .'live,' or new,
ivory, which now comes down is that pro
cured by hunters attached to tbo different
trading houses. 1 may add that live ivory
commands a higher price1 than ths dead. A
state -expedition visited a native king
some months ago in tbe interior. Upon leav
ing the commanding officer presented
the king with a uniform coat, cocked
bat and sword. The king, in return, pre
sented the officer with JW tusks of ivory.,
averaging 20 pofinds each, and provided
carriers to take them to tho river. These
people do not recognize the value, and
laugh at the trader for buying. Some of
these kings have stockades ot ivory built
around their dwellmKS."
