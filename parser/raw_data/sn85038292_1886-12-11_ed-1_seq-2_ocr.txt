SATURDAY, DECEMBER 11, 1886.
The Eastern Question.
The ‘"Eastern Question,” so called, and
‘•the Balance of Power,” have long vexed
the countries of Western Europe. They
are leading topics in continental politics,
but arc seldom presented in a clear and in
telligible light on this side the water. The
compilers of the news in Europe, fortrans
mission to this country by telegraph, usu
ally do it in the most confused and bung
ling manner, so that, little reliance can he
placed on it. We have been accustomed
to read, for years, such annnouncements as
—“War Imminent,” “Another TV ar
Cloud in Europe,” “The Turkish Army
Mobilized,” “Active Military Preparations
in Russia,” “The Czar Negotiating a War
Loan,” “France and Russia in Accord,”
“Germany, Austria, Italy, England and the
Porte, forming a quintuple alliance.” In
this way the world has been kept upon the
ragged edge of uncertainty and suspense,
and, the powers concerned, in a state of
feverish unrest. For the past twelve
month the telegraph has alternately an
nounced “war imminent,” and then “more
pacific intelligence,” or “the war-cloud
has passed away.” Speculation has doubt
less had much to do with these rumors of
wars and contradictory Statements, but ig
norance of the true slate of the case, on the
part of those whose business it is to collate
these dispatches, is largely responsible for
them.
Russia is become a colossal power on
land, but is comparatively weak upon the
sea, for the lack of sufficient coast and
ports suitable for the construction and
harbor of a powerful navy. The Czar is
ambitious to provide himself with these
elements of power, and hence is looking
towards Turkey to possess himself of
them. The other powers, actuated by
jealousy and fear, are watching his every
move l ' 'lit, resolved that he shall not ag
grandize himself, to their own peril, or to
the disturbance of the present equilibrium
or status.
In the event of war, France would be
the only one of the western powers to side
with the Muscovite. This she will do to
be avenged upon Germany and to recover,
her lost provinces of Alsace and Loraine,
and to wipe out the humiliation of Sedan
and the surrender of Paris.
A contemporary says that “the practical
way to settle the Eastern Question, possi
bly for all time, and relieve the TVestcrn
nations ultimately from their present pro
tection of Turkey against Russian aggres
sion, is the establishment of a new European
Kingdom, to be made up of the provinces
of Roumelia, Macedonia, Thessaly,
Albania, Herzegovina, Croatia, Bosnia,
Servia, Wallachia, Moldavia,
Greece and the Islands of the Archipelago.
This would make a large and compact
Kingdom with Constantinople as the capi
tal; or to make it more compact would be
to exchange Moldavia with Austria for
Dalmatia, which would then bring it up to
and along nearly the whole length of the
Adriatic, aud the body of the Kingdom
JRO2IUI u,- .ihniwft- the 4dcialm the
Black Sea.
If the people of the present divisions of
Turkey in Europe could be made to unite
at all, and then with the present Kingdom
of Greece and the Islands adjacent, there
could be constructed a Kingdom as strong
as that of Italy or Austria, it would help
the peace of Europe. It would very much
assist in disentangling the Eastern question
and transfer from Europe to Asia some of
the rivalries and jealousies growing out of
the present weakened condition of the
Turkish Government."
Law vs. Anarchy.
Minister McLane has been requested by
the Municipal Council of Paris to inter
cede with the Governor of Illinois in be
half of the condemned anarchists of
Chicago. Two Assemblies of the Knights
of Labor, in Chicago, have passed resolu
tions declaring that the trial was an out
rage on common justice; and an assault on
free speech and the right of the people to
assemble for the discussion of their griev
ances. Will these Knights of Labor
insult the public intelligence so far as to
claim that these anarchists were tried for
the exercise of free speech and for assem
bling to discuss their grievances? Is the
throwing of dynamite bombs and the
slaughter of twenty or thirty people a
right which these people claim to exercise ?
If so, then it is the undoubted right of the
rest of society to suppress them with powder
and ball, and by every other means and
appliance known to self-defence. It is
understood that these cases have been ap
pealed to the Supreme Court, and that the
money to pay the costs has been raised by
the anarchists.
The progress of all these movements is
watched with the keenest interest.by the
““ 1 nubile; which is anxious to know if a
crime, such as that at Chicago, diabolical
in its character beyond all precedent since
the days of Guy Fawkes, shall not be
avenged by the law. If these condemned
criminals should escape justice, by any
means whatever, it would do more to un
chain the tiger of popular fury than any
thing which has ever occurred in this
country. Society is bound to protect it
self, and if it cannot do it within the forms
of law. it will do it without them.
The President’s Message.
In accordance with the constitutional
requirement, President Cleveland on Mon
day last sent his annual message to Con
gress, giving in detail the operations of the ]
government for the past year and such sug- 1
gestions and recommendations as he thought (
were necessary for the general good or for 1
the guidance of the national legislature.
The message is written in the President’s j
usual terse and vigorous style, and is es- i
scntially a business document. It has been ,
generally commended by the press of both f
parties and the independent press. A *
good synopsis is published in another s
column, the document being too long to 1
give entire in the Advocate. n

Ex (tussive Federal Taxation.
Elsewhere in this issue We give an 6k
tract from President Cleveland's aribual
message, on the subject of taxation and
revenue reform. The President expresses
himself in no ambiguous terms, and there
can be but one meaning extracted from his
language. He calls attention to the fact
that increased revenue and economy in its
collection is resulting in a large surplus over
necessary expenses, with no outstanding
debt that can be cancelled. This, he says,
will not only result in extravagance, and
consequent national demoralization, but
the exaction from the people of more than
enough to meet the expenses of govern
ment, economically administered, is ruth
less extortion and a violation of the funda
mental principles of a free government.
The money demanded is exacted in an in
direct way, but it is paid by the people as
absolutely as though the tax-gatherer col
lected the hard cash outright.
The rate of federal taxation is about as
great now, with a large part of the late
war debt extinguished and the balance re
funded at a very low rate of interest, as it
was twenty-five years ago, when a large
army had to be supported, the public debt
immense, and when the government paid
a high interest. The present condition of
affairs, saj-s the President, demand a re
vision of the revenue laws so that the re
ceipts of the government shall be reduced
to the necessary expenses of its economical
administration.
We call special attention to the extract
because the matter of revenue reform is
the leading question of the day.
Democratic Economy.
The Secretary of the Treasury has sent
to Congress the estimates of the appropri-,
ations for the fiscal year, which will end
June 30th, 1888. The total amount esti
mated as required for all expenses of the
government is §325,185, 1 94, which is
§14,403,759 less than the sum called for
in the estimates submitted last year, and
§3,272,691 less than the aggregate of ap
propriations for the present fiscal year.
The estimates for tire executive establish
ment, the judicial establishment, the mili
tary establishment, the naval establish
ment, public works and postal service, are
in excess of the appropriations for those
! objects for the current fiscal year. There
is an increase of about §4,000,000 for
* public works, about §3,000,000 for the
1 naval establishment, about §1,000,000 for
the military, and about §1,000,000 for the
postal service. The estimates are less than
the appropriations in the following instan
ces : About §20,000 less for the legisla
-1 live establishment, over §5,000,000 less
for foreign intercourse, about 840,000 less
for Indian affairs, over 80,000,000 less for
pensions, nearly §2,000,000 less for per
manent annual appropriations, and over
§2,000,000 less for miscellaneous objects.
An Item for Farmers.
Forty thousand tons of manilla cord are
annually used in the cord-binding harves
ters of this country. Manilla hemp pays
, a duty of §25 per ton, consequently the
t farmers pay one million of dollars per an
num on this article alone. In
low price of wheat J****- VJUMFORTS.
bewgUif' '..1 '. . .... '
Hums tax and place manilla on the free
list. Everyone can see that a tax of 81,000,-
000 on the cord used by their harvosters,
is an odious and oppressive tax. And
yet, the Republican party will not touch
the tariff because, forsooth, it “protects”
American labor! This is the same sortot
protection that the wolf gives to the lamb.
The Republican party spent, on an aver
age, about §13,0110,000 per annum for
twenty years, from 1865 to 1885, amount
ing to §260,000,000, on a navy, and yet
there is scarcely a single vessel afloat, that
( is seaworthy, to show for this immense
sum. What did they do with this §260,.
000,000 is a question often asked but never
answered.
Gov. Lee, of Virginia, has refused to
interfere with the decisions of the courts
in the case of Thomas J. Cluverius, con
victed at Richmond of the murder of Fan
nie Lillian Madison. This was the last
hope of the condemned man, and he will
shortly go to the gallows.
A supplement is issued with the Advo
cate this week, in order that advertise
ments may not encroach too much on space
allotted to reading matter. Some interest
ing articles will be found in the supple
ment, together with a number of adver
tisements.
The President was so far improved on
Tuesday as to be able to preside at the
regular Cabinet meeting.
“Eternal process” is still “moving on”.
The snow storm of Saturday and Sunday
extended over a wide area of territory, reach
ing from the middle sections of Louisians,
Alabama and Mississippi, through the Missis
sippi Valley, northeastward, and-the Atlantic
coast States, north of Florida. The snow fall
in the mountains of South Carolina was G
inches; at Chattanooga, 9; at Montgomery,
Ala.. 10; at Grenada, Miss., S; at Washington,
D. C., 5, and at Baltimore, G. The snow fall
in Alabama was the heaviest ever known
there. It was freezing all day Saturday at
Vicksburg, and in Charleston ice formed in
exposed places. The storm was very severe
along the New York and New England coasts,
with high winds, and on Sunday night it was
still snowing at intervals along the coast from
North Carolina to Maine. In the interior it
was clearing. Heavy sleet and snow contin
ued Monday in the Carolinas and Virginia.
At Columbia, South Carolina, sleet covered
the ground to a depth of from three to six
inches, and the street cars and railway trains
were stopped. At Asheville, North Carolina,
the snow was 26 inches in depth. The Ashe
ville Tobacco Works, the Shelton Tobacco
Warehouse, and the wholesale provision store
of Dickson A Watson were crushed in by the
weight of snow upon their roof. In Virginia,
snow 15 inches deep is reported at Lynch
burg, Harrisonburg and Staunton. Snow,
rain and hffil have been almost continuous at
Richmond since Saturday morning. Snow
fell at Mobile, Alabama, on Sunday from day
light until dark.
James A. Wales, cartoon artist of Puck,
The Judge and other publications, died on
Monday in the private office of a restaurant
in New Y’ork, after taking a dose of bromide 1
of potassium in some liquor. After drinking
the liquor-he stretched himself on a sofa to '
sleep. Some hours later be was discovered i
to be dead. A doctor was summoned, and 1
announced his belief that Mr, Wales died of I
syncope from organic cardiac disease, result- t
ing from an overdose of bromide.
In Rending, Penna., Monday, Joseph Sea
man met a friend on the street who bad a ■
bottle which he jokingly said contained old t
rye and offered Seaman a drink. Seaman *
placed tbs bottle to bis mouth, and before be 1
could be slopped drank some of its contents, t
which proved to be amonia. His stomach I
and intestines were so badly burned that bo t
became unconscious. His injuries ate expect- i
ed to prove fatal. 1
The Resident's Message.
Front the Baltimore Sum
The President’s message Id Congress is a
comprehensive paper, discussing with special ,
earnestness and force the leading questions of (
the day, such as the necessity of tariff re
form, the interests of labor as affected by ex
isting federal taxation, and the suspension of
the coinage of silver. After adverting to our ,
peaceful relations with foreign countries, the
Chinese question, the beneficial change effect
ed by the Colombian government in erecting
Panama into a federal district, the unsettled
state of the Canadian fisheries question, the
propriety of strengthening our intimacy with
Hawaii by renewing the existing treaty, our
moral right and duty to assist Liberia in con
serving its integrity, the issue of extra terri
torial jurisdiction raised by the action of
Mexico in the Cutting case, the complaint of
the government of the Netherlands in regard
to our special tariff impost upon Sumatra
tobacco, the Samoan Islands protectorate,
our commercial relations with the Spanish
Antilles, the international copyright question,
and the revision of laws affecting the consular
service, the President proceeds to the discus
sion of our several national problems. The
revenues of the year ended June 30, 1886,
show an increase of $13,749,020.68 over last
year, there being an increase of $11,434,084.10
from customs and of $4,407,219.04 from in
ternal revenue, and a falling off in other re
ceipts of $2,092,274.36. The expense of col
lecting both customs and internal revenue
have been reduced, the net saving being
$646,000. The total ordinary receipts were
$336,439,727.06, and the total ordinary ex
penditures were $242,483,138.50. The ex
penses were $17,788,797 less than the preced
ing year, and the surplus was $93,956,588.56,
an increase over the year ended June 30,
1885, of $30,492,817.29. For the current
year the estimate surplus will be ninety mil
lions. The income of the government is de
clared to be now more than ever in excess of
public necessities. The application ot the
surplus to the extinguishment of the public
debt would retire all the public indebtedness
which can be now called in in less than a
year. When this is done, either the surplus
must be withdrawn from circulation and
hoarded in the treasury or wc must engage in
wasteful public extravagance. The worst
phase of the existing system is the perversion
of the relations between the people and the
government. When more than is needed to
pay the debts of the government and to pro
vide for its economical administration is col
lected, “such exaction becomes ruthless ex
tortion and a violation of the fundamental
, principles of free government.” The Presi
dent says that those who toil for daily wages
are beginning to understand that capital is
. sluggish till it springs into activity touched by
the hand of labor, and gains the value which
1 enables it to bear the burden of federal taxa
i tion, aud they have begun to thoughtfully in
quire whether in these circumstances, and
considering the tribute they constantly pay
i into the public treasury, they receive their fair
share of advantages. There is also a suspicion
abroad, adds the President, that the surplus
■ indicates abnormal business profits, which,
under the system which produces such sur
plus, increase, without corresponding benefit
■ to the people at large, great fortunes which
are not the natural growth of a steady, plain
and industrious republic. The burden to
5 which the agricultural interest, the most im
-5 portant of all in the country, is subjected by
the increased cost of living caused by the
3 tariff, while its products have to compete
r abroad with crops raised by less expensive
methods, is pointed out. The laborer will gain
1 by every reduction in the cost of living which
r does not involve a reduction in the amount of
work or rate of wages. The larger part of our
" revenues will have to be collected from cus
i toms. Keeping in view all these considera
tions, the President recommends that the in
creasing and unnecessary surplus of the
- national income annually accumulating be re
, leased to the people by an amendment to our
* revenue laws, which shall cheapen the price
3 of the necessaries of life and give freer en
r trance to such imported materials as by
American labor may be manufactured into
‘ marketable commodities. The total coinage
r of silver dollars since the passage of the
Bland bill has been $247,131,549. Of this
* amount at the present time the people hold
either in coin or silver certificates $166,873,-
041. The recommendation of last year that
the coinage be suspended is renewed upon
a all the grounds there set forth, reinforced by
the significant increase in our gold exporta
tions. In treating of array and navy affairs
. the President reiterates the absolute necessity
? of better harbor defenses, and the hope is ex
* effective steps will be taken
> immediately. It is also s ig
f the army and navy contract*
i purch£ e g 0 un it e d a s to give encouragement
1, or jomestic manufacturers to eat£|vtfie basi-
JS& of producing gun steel amfarmor plates.
renoct>of tlie Postottufe
snow that the present rates ot postage will
ultimately suffice to sustain the service, j
although our people enjoy now both cheaper ,
postage, proportionately to distance, and a I
vaster and more costly service than any other i
nation on the globe. The President suggests
that, as distinguished from a grant or a sub
sidy, whatever outlay may be required to
secure additional postal service, requisite and
proper and not otherwise attainable, with the
Argentine Republic and the Empire of Brazil !
should be regarded as within the legitimate
compensation for such service. The exten- >
sion of the free-dclivery system is recommend- I
ed. The erection of one or more national
penitentiaries for the confinement of persons
convicted by the federal courts is urged, and j
it is suggested that by employing the convicts
in government work they could be made self
supporting and at the same time not bo
brought into undesirable competition with
free labor. The recommendations made last
year for an alteration in the organization of
federal courts is renewed, as is the suggestion
that a change be made in the manner of com
pensating attorneys aud marshals.
Considerable space in the message is de- j
voted to a discussion of the Indian question
and the presentation of additional arguments I
i in favor of the commission suggested in the
last message, which should be able to put in
operation different methods of Indian man
agement adapted to the different phases of
development in which the different tribes are,
with tfie ultimate object of alloting to them
all lands in severalty and bringing them into
the mass of our citizens. The energetic ef
forts of the land department under the present
administration have succeeded in restoring to
the public domain two million seven hundred
and fifty thousand acres of land wrongfully
appropriated, and almost as much more is
now in litigation. The aggregation of public
lands in large holdings by persons, many of
whom are foreigners, is commented upon as a
serious evil. It is recommended that the pre
emption and timber culture acts be repealed,
ana that the homestead law be so amended as j
to make the requirements of residence and
cultivation much more strict. Restriction
upon the alienation of homestead rights until
after patents hayc been issued are also sug
gested. Much has been done to secure the
removal of unlawful fences from the public
domain, but much still remains to be done.
The report of the commissioner of pensions
shows a net increase of more than 20,000 pen
sioners during the year, and the President
points out the injustice done by indiscrimi
nate pension legislation. The plan suggested
by the Secretary of the Interior and approved
by the government directors in the Pacific
railroads for a change in the method of pay
ing the indebtedness of those roads to the
government is referred to with the comment
that the “only matters” to be considered are
the situation of the government as a creditor
and the surest way to secure the payment of
the principal and interest of its debt. Federal
legislation upon the subject of railroad rates
for interstate commerce is in the j
light of the recent decision of the Supreme
Court as a subject worthy of consideration.
Upon the question of the relations of labor
and capital the recommendations in the spe
cial message of last year that the labor
bureau be given powers to arbitrate in cases
between employers and employes voluntarily
referred to it are renewed, and it is declared
that after law has done all that it can “much
more remains to be accomplished in the rein
statement and cultivation of a true American
sentiment which recognizes the equality of
American citizenship.” The work of the de
partment of agriculture is favorably com
mented upon and the extension of its function
suggested. The application by Congress of
such legislation as the constitutional limits
will permit to the extinction of the pleuro
pneumonia among the cattle of several States
is recommended.
It is stated that the continued operation of
the law relating to the civil service has added
the most convincing proofs of its necessity
and usefulness, and the cheerful and ungrudg
ing support of Congress is invoked for the
reform. An increase in the salaries of the
civil-service commissioners is recommended.
The plain duty of paying the unpaid claims 1
of the depositors in the Frcedmen’s Savings J
and Trust Company is called to the attention 1
of Congress, and the message closes with cer
tain recommendations relating to the local
affairs of the District of Columbia. j
The colored men imported from the South I
several months ago to take the places of *
striking white miners at the Grape Greek
Company’s mines at Danville, Illinois, struck ]
Monday evening for 75 cents per ton for -
mining. They had been working by the day f.
but were notified Saturday by the Superin- (
tendeot that commencing on Monday he •
would only pay 65 cents per ton. Three e
hundred men went out, 1
Excessive* Taxation. j
[extract from the president's message.]
The income of the government, by its in
creased volume and through economies in its
collection, is now more than ever in excess of
public necessities. The application of the |
surplus to the payment of such portion of the
public debt as is now at our option subject to
extinguishment, if continued at the rate which
has lately prevailed, would retire that class
of indebtedness within less than one year from 1
this date. Thus a continuation of our present
revenue system would soon result in the re- a
ceipt of an annual income much greater than
necessary to meet government expenses, with 2
no indebtedness upon which it could be ap
plied. We should then be confronted with a
vast quantity of money, the circulating medium
of the people, hoarded in the treasury when
it should be in their hands, or we should be
drawn into wasteful public extravagance with
all the corrupting national demoralization j
which follows in its train.
But it is not the simple existence of this 1
surplus and its threatened attendant evils 1
which furnish the strongest argument against
our present scale of federal taxation. Its
worst phase is the Exaction of such a surplus
through a perversion of the relations between 1
the people and their government, and a dan
gerous departure from the rules which limit
the right of federal taxation.
Good government, and especially the gov- ]
eminent of which every American citizen (
boasts, has for its objects the protection of (
every person within its care in the greatest
liberty consistent with the good order of s
society and his perfect security in the enjoy- j
ment of his earnings, with the least possible i
diminution for public needs. When more
of the people's substance is exacted through
the form of taxation than is necessary to meet 1
the just obligations of the government and 1
the expense of its economical administration,
such exaction becomes ruthless extortion i
and a violation of the fundamental principles
of a free government. 1
The indirect manner in which these exac
tions are made has a tendency to conceal
their true character and their extent. But
we have arrived at a stage of, superfluous
revenue which has aroused the people to a
realization of the fact that the amount raised
professedly for the support of the government ,
is paid by them as absolutely, if added to the
price of the things which supply their daily
wants, as if it was paid at fixed periods into the 1
hand of the tax-gatherer.
Those who toil for daily wages are begin
ning to understand that capital, though some
times vaunting its importance and clamoring
for the protection and favor of the govern
ment, is dull and sluggish till, touched by the
magical hand of labor, it springs into activity,
furnishing an occasion for federal taxation
and gaining the value which enables it to bear ;
its burden. And the laboring man is thought- i
fully inquiring whether in these circumstances, !
and considering the tribute he constantly 1
pays into the public treasury as he supplies
his daily wants, he receives his fair share ot i
advantages. i
There is also a suspicion abroad that the j
surplus of our revenues indicates abnormal j
and exceptional business profits, which, under
the system which produces such surplus, in
crease, without corresponding benefit to the
people at large, the vast accumulations of a
few among our citizens whose fortunes, rival
ing the wealth of the most favored in anti-
Democratic nations, are not the natural
growth of a steady, plain and industrious re- I
public.
Oar farmers too, and those engaged directly |
and indirectly in supplying the products of |
agriculture, see that day by day,' and as often j
as the daily wants of their households recur, j
' they are forced to pay excessive and needless I
taxation, while their products struggle in for- !
eign markets with the competition of nations, !
which by allowing a freer exchange of pro
ductions than we permit, enable their people
to sell for prices which distress the American ;
‘ farmer. I
As every patriotic citizen rejoices in the
constantly increasing pride of our people in !
American citizenship and in the glory of our |
national achievements and progress, a senti- ;
! ment prevailes that the leading strings useful
i to a nation in its infancy may well be to a :
i great extent discarded in the present stage of ,
American ingenuity, courage and fearless I
self-reliance. And for the privilege of indulg
ing this sentiment with true American enthu
siasm, our citizens are quite willing to forego
an idle surplus in the public treasury.
And all the people know that the average
rate of federal taxation upon imports is to-day,
r in time of peace, but little less, while upon
some articles of necessary consumption it is
■- actually more than was imposed by the griev
ous burdens willingly borne at a time when
k the government needed -millions to maintain
: by war the safety and integrity of the Union.
It has been the policy of the government to j
, collect the principal part of its revenues by a
tax upon M>uuris. and no
policy is desirable. But the present condi
tion of affairs constrains our people to demand
that by a revision of our revenue laws the <
receipts of the government shall be reduced
to the necessary expense of its economical j
administration, and the demand should be
recognized and obeyed by the people’s repre
sentatives in the legislative branch of the |
government.
READJUSTMENT OF THE BURDENS.
In readjusting the burdens of federal taxu- :
lion a sound public policy requires that such
1 of our citizens as have built up large and im- ;
' portant industries under present conditions
should not be suddenly, and to their injury, j
deprived of advantages to which they have |
adapted their business; but if the public good
requires it they should be content with such |
consideration as shall deal fairly and cau
tiously with their interests, while the just de- '
maud of the people for relief from needless
taxation is honestly answered.
A reasonable and timely submission to such
a demand should certainly be possible with
out disastrous shock to any interest, and a
cheerful concession sometimes averts abrupt
and heedless action, often the outgrowth of
impatience and delayed justice.
Due regard should be also accorded in any j
proposed readjustment to the interests of ;
American labor so far as they are involved, j
We congratulate ourselves that there is among
us no laboring class, fixed within unyielding
bounds and doomed under all conditions to
the inexorable fate of daily toil. We
nize in labor a chief factor in the wealth of
the republic, and we treat those who have it
in their keeping us citizens entitled to the
most careful regard and thoughtful attention.
This regard and attention should be awarded i
them, not only because labor is the capital of (
our workingmen, justly entitled to its share of j
government favor, but for the further and not j
less important reason, that the laboring man
surrounded by his family in his humble home,
as a consumer is vitally interested in all that
cheapens the cost of living and enables him
to bring within his domestic circle additional
comforts and advantages.
This relation of the workingman to the
revenue laws of the country, and the manner
in which it palpably influences the question
i of wages, should not be forgotten in the justi
fiable prominence given to the proper main
tenance of the supply and protection of well
paid labor. And these considerations sug
gest such an arrangement of government
revenues as shall reduce the expense of liv
ing, while it does not curtail the opportunity
for work nor reduce the compensation of
American labor and injuriously affect its con
dition and the dignified place it holds in the
estimation of our people.
But our farmers and agriculturists—those
who from the soil produce the things con
sumed by all—are perhaps more directly and j
plainly concerned than any other of our citi- i
zens in a just and careful system of federal'
taxation. Those actually engaged in and 1
i more remotely connected with this kind of
i work number nearly one-half of our popula
tion. None labor harder or more conlinu
ously than they. No enactments limit their
hours of toil, and no interposition of the
government enhances to any great extent the
value of their products. And yet for many
of the necessaries and comforts of life r which ]
the most scrupulous economy enables them i
to bring into their homes, and for their im
plements of husbandry they arc obliged to
pay a price largely increased by an unnatural
profit which, by the action of the govern
ment, is given to the more favored manufac
turer.
REDUCTION OK THE TARIFF.
I recommend that, keeping in view all these .
considerations, the increasing and unneces
sary surplus of national income annually ac
cumulating, be released to the people, by an
amendment to our revenue laws, which shall
cheapen the price of the necessaries of life
and give freer entrance to such imported
material's as by American labor may be man- j
ufactured into marketable commodities.
Nothing can be accomplished, however, in
the direction of this much-needed reform,
unless the subject is approached in a patri- ,
otic spirit of devotion to the interests of the .
entire country, and with a willingness to yield j
something for the public good.
A telegram from the City of Mexico says it
is generally believed there “that diplomatic
questions of grave importance will sooq arise
between the United States and Mexico,
growing out of the position taken by Presi- 1
dent Cleveland against the right of Mexico to \
try Aoiericans committing offenses against (
Mexico while on American soil.” The tele
gra m adds; “The newspapers of all shades qf
opinions stand by the Government in this
matter, on the ground that the principle is a
sound one and approved by some of the most
highly civilised nations of the world,”
