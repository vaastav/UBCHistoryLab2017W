SOME rOINTS IH THE
PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE.
When the misdeed of eticcewftilly
dishonest men are discovered, suffer
ing comee riot only upm them, hut
upon the innocent men whom they
have misled.
There may be honest differences of
opinion a to manv governmental pol
icies, hut aiirely there ran lie no such
difference aa to the need of unllin. h
ing pcrsTronce in the war against
successful dishonesty,
Gentraliration In business ha al
ready come and cannot be avoided or
undone, and tho .... public at
large ran only protect Itself from
certain evil effects of thin huinc
centralization by providing la-tti-r
metlioda for tho control throupli the
Authority already centralized in the
national government by the constitu
tion Itself.
Until the national government a
aumea proper control of intcrtiite
commene, in the exereine of the au
thority it already powec, it will lie
impoMihle cither to give to or get
from the railroads full jutiee.
Combination i not only necestorv
"but inevitable.
Corporation and labor union alike
have come to tay. Each if properly
managed ia aouire of good and not
evil.
Power of supervision over big btiHi
nea concern engaged in interstate
commerce would benefit them a it
haa benefited tho national banka. In
the recent business crii it i note
worthy that the, institution which
failed were institution which wore
not under the supervision and control
of the national pjvernnient.
We need a greater elasticity in our
currency.
No legislation con by any possibil
ity guarantee the btisinosa commun
ity against the results of ppeculative
folly.
"'When an individual mortgage his
hoime to buy an automobile, he in
vite disaster.
There is- an evident and constantly
growing feeling among our people
that tho time is rapidly approaching
when our system of revenue legisla
tion muwt be revised.
The two great evil in the execu
tion of our criminal laws today are
sentimentality and technicality. . .'
, . Both of these evils must lie re
moved or public discontent with, the
criminal law will continue.
J earnestly commend to the atten
tion of Congress this matter, so that
some way may be devised which will
limit the abuse of injunctions.
The general introduction of the.
eight-hour day should he the goal
toward which we 'should steadily tend,
awl the government should set the
example in this respect.
Nothing is more needed that the
best type of industrial school, the
school for the mechanical industries
in the city, the school for practically
teaching agriculture in the country.
We cannot afford to, lose that pre
eminently typical American, tho
farmer who owns his own medium
sized farm.
The country is Unquestionably on
the verge of a timber famine. . . .
There should be no tariff on any
forest product grown in this coun
try. I commend to the favorable con
sideration of the Congress a postal
earing bank system.
Washington, D. C, Dec. 3. On the
convening of the House and Senate at
noon today, the president's annual mes
sage was received and read. The mes
sage was long and consumed more than
an hour in the. reding. The galleries
were crowded with visitors who came
to hear what President Koosevelt had
to say. The senators and representa
tives having received printed copies, paid
nine Jiera i me remng. J. lie. principal
features of the message are as follows:
No nation has greater resources than
ours, and I think it can be truthfully
taid that the citizens of no nation pos
ses greater energy and industrial abil
ity. In no nation are tho fundamental
business conditions sounder than in ours
at this very moment, and it is foolish
when such is the case for peo

BURNS EASILY WON
LAST NIGHT'S FIGHT
After The Fiftli Round, Victory Over

tain Englishmen Were Not
Greatly Disappointed.
London, Bee. 3. Tommy Burns, of
America, knocked out Gunner Moir of
I Kngland in the tenth round before 'tho
National Sporting club here Inst night.
Englishmen never had great hopes of
the ability of their representative to re
gain their lost nonors in the boxing
arena and in a somewhat unexciting
contest the American champion had R
comparatively easy task in disposing of
Moir'a pretensions" and securing for him-
; clf the title of heavy weight champion
of tho world.
After the fifth round Burns' victory
J was certain and in the tenth when the
-. Gunner failed to rise to the cull of time
rnd was literally cut to pieces, Burns
left the ring with scarcely a mark.

HAIL VERDICT
WITH MUCH JOY
Court Crowd" Cheers Ars.
Bradley, Not Guilty,
WHO HURRIED TO A FRIEND
Jury Id Famous Case of Woman Charged
With Murdering Former Senator
Arthur Biown of Utah Rctutntd
a Verdict To-day.
Washington. P. C, IVe. 3 -Mr. Annie
Bradley tn today found not guilty of
murdering former I'nited Btales Senator
Arthur I'.rown of I'tah at a hotel in
thU city. The cae ha been on trial for
three week and lia been national in
the extreme. Judge Stafford delivered
the charge to the jury yenterdav after-
noon, Iwginning at 3:25 and ending at
4:17, when the jury took tho ce. At
III o'clock lat night the jury reported no
pro-pe.-t of an agreement a,t that time
and were h k-l up for Jho night.
The verdict wa rrturtird at l);07 to
day. Tho jury took two ballot only,
t'n the tlrt vote it wa II to 1 f.ir ac
quittal. The second, taken about mil
night. w imaniitx.il for acquittal. Not
the slightest hint that an agreement had
Iwen resetted ram from the court r-xun
iefore the usual hour arrived for the
oning of the fi-urt. When the verdict
wa announced, there wa a moment'
silence; then a gTcat cheer went up in
the court room, which the bailiffs had
ditliciilty in subduing, The women (-ev
tators were particularly enthusiastic,
jumping to their feet, applauding and
waving their handkerchief.
Mr. Bradley hurried from the court
house to an autotnobile belonging to
S. J. Master, which wa waiting just
outside, and wa taken quickly to the
house of Mr. Have, one of her friend.
The crowd which had surged out of the
court house after her, again cheered as
the auto started up the street.
Judge Stafford's Charge.
In delivering his charge, Judge Staf
ford said:
"The law require a man to master hi
passion and punishe him if he d-e not.
The emotional insanity theory is entire
ly rejected in this district. If there is
a rca.-onablu doubt of the defendant's
mental responsibility, the defendant
should I acquitted.
"It may be diftmilt to be uninfluenced
by pcrr-nal wi.-he or sympathies. It is
a severe test of your aWlity to be un
swayed by jour fetling."
The court spoke of former Senator
Brown's moral delinquencies, which he
discussed with some sharpness and add
ed: "In passing moral judgment no man
can weigh in equal balance the man and
the woman." it is impossible for the
manly man, he said, to withhold con
demnation when a' man seduce and
alandn a woman. In this ease, as in
all other, he added, we have only the
course of duty to follow. Though re
ferring to the pardoning power of the
president and the discretion vented in the
executive, he pointed out that mercy was
no part of the jury' province.
The court charged that if Mrs. Brad
ley went to isrown's room to shoot her
self, and Brown rushed to prevent her
from shooting herself and the pistol
killed him, she would lie guilty of man
slaughter and nothing more. The court
also suggested the possibility that Mrs.
Bradley may have been menacing Brown
to awe him into marrying her, but with
out intending to shoot him, and that in
trying to prevent what he thought was
her purposo to shoot him he was shot
and killed, that would be manslaughter.
The court also suggested that Brown
might have been rushing toward her, and
tho circumstances of their relations and
the way he approached her and the pro
vocation may have been audi as to shake
any ordinary judgment and she lired,
even intending to take hi life, that
would ho manslaughter. But if the evi
dence satiflc tho jury that she did fire
intentionally into Brown's body, she is
guilty of murder, at least in the second
degree; if intentionally and deliberately
and with premeditated m lice, then it
was murder in the fust degree.
