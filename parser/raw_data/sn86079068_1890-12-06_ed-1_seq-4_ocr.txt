The President's message to the 2nd
session of the Fifty-firrt Congtess is a
I carefulty prepared docume't, so Much
l' so that its ehtbration is tedious and
" confusing. In brief, i'e, expt-esses
himself, as thnroughly satsfied' with
3 the entire work accomplished by the
t' Republicans at last sersion, and con
grkiddhttes them. He is ernightically
in favor of the McKinley tariff bill,
and hopes for its passage. He highly
.approves' of the Force Bill, and earn
estly urges that it be pushed thiough.
Id° fact, the' message is the torch
which has "butr'ed thelf bridge ' be
t hind the Republican party, and they
" have got to fight.it,outon the line they
have chosen. With disaffection in the
Cabinet, and ``Mr Blaine of Maine"
diametrically opposed to the Presi
dent's policy, it seems to us that the
Republican pat'ty will never be able
to straddle "de old4 gray horse" which

made during the past year for the

WASHINGTON LETTER.
[From our Regular Correspondent.1
WASHINGTON, Nov. 28, 1890.
Editor Advertiser
Mr. Harrison, Speaker Raed, Rep
resentative McKinley and all the oth
er Republican advocates for a contin
uation at the that session of Congress
of the radical programme begun at the
last session are going through a panic
just now. They fear that there will
not be a Republican quorum present
in the House before Christmas, and
that it will be impossible to compel
many of the Republicans who have
been defeated to attend the session
regularly, and without a Republican
quorum they know that their game is
blocked, as the Democrats are fully
determined that no political apportion
ment shall be made, unless it be done
by Republican votes entirely; and the
same thing holds good regarding the
notorious subsidy shipping bills.
The Democratic leaders have no
desire to see an extra session of Con
gress in the Spring, and if there be
one, which now seems altogether prob
able, it will be the fault of the Re
publicans. The Democrats are ready
and willing to aid in passing the reg
ular appropriation bills for the support
of the Government, but they propose
resisting to the last extremity any at
tempt to pass political legislation.
It is specially pleasing to the Dem
ocrats to learn that it has been decided
by bosses Reed, McKinley, and Can
non, whose control of the House com
mittee on Rules makes them absolute
dictators of the business to come be
fore the House, that the tariff law
shall not be modified or amended at
this session. It was feared that the
Republicans would be sensible enough
at the coming session to get back the
votes they lost, by revising the objec
tionable features, and there are few
that are not objectionable of the new
tariff law in a business manner. But
they have elected to stand or fall by
the new law, which makes their fall
certain when the people again get a
whack at them in 1892.
A semi-official announcement has
been made by Mr. McKinley that no
silver or other financial legislation
would be passed this winter. The cry
of the agriculturist, voiced by the
heavy vote of the Farmers Alliance,
for financial relief is to be ignored un
til the Democratic House comes in.
Secretary Windom will, I am inform
ed, propose in his annual report a re
lief in the shape of 11, and 2 per cent
bonds to be issued by the Government,
to be convertible into cash upon de
mand of the holder--.this idea is bor
rowed from the old greenback party
but of course it will require Congres
sional legislation before they could be
issued, and if Mr. McKinley spoke by
the card, and the presumption is that
he did, Mr. Windom's recommenda
tion will be good for nothing.
Ex-Representative Warner, who-was
here all last session as an advocate of
silver legislation says the silver men
will submit three propositions to Con
gress : first, free coinage; second, free
coinage limited to silver produced in
this country until France and Germa
ny shall buy American silver; third,
the coinage of about $20,00(,OO to
equal the amount of national bank
notes retired during the last year
and that they will leave no stone un
turned to get one of them passed.
Either of them could be passed if a
vote could he had upon them, but how
the House can pass a bill which the
committee on Rules refuses to allow it
to consider I cannot see.
One has only to circulate among the
the leading Democratic members of
Congress now here to discover what a
broken reed the Republicans are lean
ing upon in expecting that Democrat
ic mistakes in the next House are to
give them an opportunity of winning
in 1892. Present indications are that
there will be no Democratic mistakes,
at least not serious ones. The Demo
cratic programme will be first of all to
give the people more money by provi
ding for the free coinage of silver, and
to revise tariff in a way that will re
duce the prices of clothing and agri
cultural supplies and implements, and
at the same time give the farmer prac
tical reciprocity by enlarging the mar
ket'for the sale of their supplies. No
mistakes in a programme of that sort
is there? '(the Democrat, propose to
confine' theuiselves to' legislating for
the people, that is all classes-, and not
for'a few favored 'individuals.
Nearly all of the gentlemen who
have announced theMreelves as candi
dates.orr who have1been placed in nom
ination by tlheir. friends for the Speak
ership of the next' House, are now
here, and they are onie iad all greatly
surprised to learn of the bitter fight
.each 4nd every ong of them is mtIing,
in the newspapers, for tire' coveted
honor, and it is a source of no little
ainusemdnt among them.
Mr. Harrison's annual 'message to
Congress will, 'aceording to a gentle
man `.whh ought to know' whereof he
speaks, be confined to an apleial-to the
Republicans to stand by protection as
exemplified' in'the McKinley law, to
pass an apportionment bill, a Federal
election bill and the steamship suibsidy
bills, and' nit to paus any silvek 'legis
lation.
