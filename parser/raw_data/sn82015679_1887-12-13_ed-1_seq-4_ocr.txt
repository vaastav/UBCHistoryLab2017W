The Chicago Tribune has evidently given
np the idea of supporting James G. Blaine on
-a free -trade platform.
We present our congratulations to Rev.
Charles A. Berry, of . Wolverhampton,
England, upon his escape from Plymouth
ehurch.
The New York Sun is not in harmony with
the President's message. It says it is a
document that is indorsed by free-traders,
fcnd by free-traders alone.
Frez-TRADE papers are greatly exercised
over what they term Mr. Blaine's "bid for
the presidency." That is their own construc
tion; but assuming it true, has he not as good
B. right to bid as Mr. Cleveland? Or was it
intended to have the office knocked down on
nly one bid? - -
The man in the gallery who sang the dox-
logy at the opening session of the House of
representatives escaped arrest only because
the door-keeper couldn't get at him; but when
he tried to sing it at the Whit9 House a day
er two ago, the officials marched him off.
They want no praises sung to any one but
Mr. Cleveland around that establishment.
There is nothing funnier in politics than
the sudden "fluke" of the free-trade Democ
racy. The word has gone out from the
White House that the message was a mistake,
and that the tax on tobacco is to be repealed,
and only a very tender reduction of the tariff
is to be made. Since the King of France
marched np the hill and then marched down
again, there has been nothing more imposing
than the burly Cleveland's attack upon the
tariff and his immediate and disorderly
retreat.
While we should be sorry to see Captain
White, of the Twelfth district, unseated by
Lowry, such action by Congress would un
doubtedly inure to the benefit of the Rupub
lican party in this State. The Democracy
themselves are tired of .Lowry, as was shown
by his overwhelming defeat in a district he
had carried two years before by 2,500 major
ity. He has absolutely no claim whatever to
the seat, and if Captain White is ejected it
will help to swell the Republican majority
next year.
Bishop McKnight, of the Mormon
Church, now engaged in missionary work in
Ohio, says in an interview that there is an
understanding between the Church and the
leaders of tho Democratic party by which
Utah is to be admitted as a State so soon as
possible, in consideration that the Mormon
leaders vouch for its remaining Democratic.
Polygamy is to be left to take care of itself.
The Bishop says he sees no harm in that kind
of an arrangement, as "such bargains are
made constantly by politicians, and no one
thinks anything of it." A political alliance
of that kind strikes us as very -degrading to
the Mormon Church.
THE party lash is being used vigorously in
Charleston, S. C. Democrats who show signs
of discontent and a disposition to think for
themselves are whipped into line. The
chairman of the State Democratic committee
eaysr "No Democrat ha3 a right to fall out of
line, and in my judgment the greatest enemy
that the Democratic party can have is the inde
pendent.'' Lieutenant-governor Mauldin says:
. "Independentism . and bolters injure good
government far more than anything else."
Other party leaders express the same lofty
sentiments, and as a result none but the most
daring "kickers" will venture to break out of
ranks this time. But the spirit of discontent
i is there and will not be crushed," and with its
growth, even from so small & beginning, dan
ger will come to the "solid South."; 1
Picking out alleged errors or , inequalties
In the tariff law and making them the text of
weeping assaults on the system Is like con
demning an entire book for a typographical
error or a work of art for a single defect. Our
railroad system is not perfect, yet it is im
mensely beneficial. Our postal system has
some glaring inequalities as charging the
same for carrying a letter from one part of the
city to another as for carrying it across the
continent yet nobody thinks of condemning
the postal system on that account. Even the
tun has spots on its surface. The question is
not whether the present tariff is perfect.
Nobody claims that it is. But the question is
whether the policy of protection as an entirety
is right, and whether a protective tariff, even
with some defects, is not vastly preferable to
free trade or to a tariff that furnishes no pro
tection at all.
THE proposition of the State-house commis
sioners to bore for natural gas on the State
house grounds is an excellent idea, and if ju
diciously executed may inure greatly to the
benefit of the city and State. The few wells
that have been bored in Marion county are by
no neans conclusive as to the limits of the
gas field, while within the city nothing like
an exhaustive test has been made. The gas
has already been found in many localities
where there was much less reason to suspect
its existence than there is within the city
limits, and, for all that anybody knows, the
State-house grounds may be underlaid by a
good supply.- A well of very moderate capac
ity would supply the State-house with fuel,
and save in a single vear several times the
cost of sinking it It would be a great card
for Indiana to be able to say that she had the
finest State-house in the Union for the money,
built within the appropriation, without the
taint of jobbery from first to last, and heated
by natural gas drawn from the State-house
grounds.
' TEE DEMOCRATIC EETEEAT-
The President has commenced backing
down on his free-trade message. The New
York Star, administration organ, in a double
leaded editorial on the surplus and revenue
question, says:
"How, then, can the reduction which is
imperatively required be made? It can be
made by throwing off the tax on tobacco, and
it cannot conveniently be made in any other
way. Last Tear the internal tax upon tobacco
yielded $30,108,067.13. That sum added to
the $30,000,000 thrown off from the tariff will
make the whole reduction $80,000,000. It is
a tidy little sum of money. What a New
Year's gtf t it will be!
"We therefore complete our yesterday's pre
diction by sayin g that the measure or meas
ures upon whichDemocrats will take their stand
will throw $50,000,000 off from the tariff and
the whole" tax from domestic tobacco. Eighty
million dollars a year left in the pockets of the
people! If you can ' beat us on that issue,
you are welcome to the spoils of your vic
tory." As the Star undoubtedly speaks by author
ity of the administration this is very signifi
cant. In fact, it is a complete change of front
on the part of the President. His message
urged the paramount necessity of reducing
the revenue by reducing tariff duties. He
did not recommend any change in internal
revenue taxes. Here is what he said:
"Our scheme of taxation by means of which
this needless surplus is taken from the public
treasury, consists of a tariff or duty levied
upon importions from abroad and internal
taxes levied on the consumption of tobacco
and spiritous and malt liquors. It must be
conceded that none of the things subjected to
internal revenue taxation are, strictly speak
ing, necessaries; there appears to be no just
complaint of this taxation by the consumers
of these articles, and there seems to be noth
ing so well able to bear the burden without
hardship to any portion of the people. But
our present tariff laws, the vicious, inequita
ble and illogical source of unnecessary taxa
tion, ought to be at once revised and
amended.
This is the only reference he makes to the
tax on liquors and tobacco, and he distinctly
recommends that they be not reduced. Now
comes his organ and demands the repeal of
the tobacco tax, amounting to $30,000,000 a
year, and informs the country that only
$50,000,000 will be thrown off from tariff
duties. In other words, the President has had
an access of information. He has been hear
ing from the country and it is dawning on
him that he does not know as much as he
thought he did. Hence, through his New
York organ he comes before the country with
an additional recommendation for the removal
of the tobacco tax and an intimation that the
tariff duties" are only to be reduced $50,000,
000. A week ago the President told Congress
that the protective tariff must be knocked
into smithereens; now his organ graciously
assures the country that it need not be wholly
destroyed but only mutilated. A week ago
the President recommended that the tax on
tobacco be left untouched; now his organ rec
ommends its repeal. The upshot of the whole
business is that the President has no distinct
ideas on the subject of tariff or revenue re
form, and neither he nor his party is fit to
be intrusted with the work. The Republican
party alone is capable of doing the work a3 it
ought to be done. The tariff is a Republican
measure, and its revision should not be in
trusted to its enemies. The Republican party
is pledged to the work. The national plat
form of 1884 said:
"The Republican party pledges itself to cor
rect the inequalities of the tariff and to reduce
the surplus, not by the vicious andindiscrimi
nating process of horizontal reduction, but by
such methods as will relieve the tax-payer
without injuring the laborer or the great pro
ductive interests of the country."
That is the position of the Republican party
to-day pledged to revenue reform by such
nothods as will still preserve the protective
system and the interests of American industry
and labor. The people are with the Repub
lican party on this question, and undoubtedly
would rather intrust the work of revising the
tariff and revenue laws to the party of protection
than to the party of free trade. The Repub
licans, unfortunately, are not in a position to
cany out their pledges, while the Democracy
are ia a position to inflict great damage on the
industrial interests of the country. The ex
tract from the President's New York organ
shows he already realizes that he cannot main
tain the extreme positions of his message, and
it also shows how completely at sea he and his
party are on this important question.
SENSIBLE POLITICS.
Pulpit utterances . upon the subject of
politics are not apt to be of an edifying sort.
Commonly the topic is touched upon in a
gingerly way, as if it were somehow of an
incendiary nature; or, if discussed at length,
& sublimated doctrine and nonsensical theo
ries are advanced. So unaccustomed is the
public to political teachings of a practical,
outspoken character from this source, that
the sermon preached on Sunday by the Rev.
Mr. Gantz, on the responsibilities of citizen
ship, must c ause a sensation of surprise; but
it is a wholesome sensation. Mr. Gantz
makes several points which young men would
do well to consider, but none deserves more
attention than the dignity and importance
which he attaches to political work. Poli
tics is the science of government, and
to devote time, and study, and la
bor to the promotion of the country's
interests is surely an honorable and patriotic
occupation. Instead of being almost a term
of reproach, as now, the title "politician"
should be one of honor and respect. Young
men should enter political life as they enter
other professions, with the understanding
that it calls for the exercise of their highest
powers; that they are taking upon themselves
more serious obligations than in less public
callings, and that the rewards of honest and
faithful devotion to the noblest principles are
even greater in this direction than any other.
Politics i3 not ward-working nor the getting
of the majority of votes by fair means or foul;
it is statesmanship, and it is time the fact was
recognized by rising youth. Another point
urged by Mr. Gantz is that measures, not men,
should be voted for. In minor offices, where
11 administrative questions are not involved, the
reverse rule may be practiced.. But if political
effort means anything it means the carrying
out of certain principles and as between two
men, one who will do this and one who will
not, the first should be chosen, although
the latter be personally faultless. As an
illustration the speaker might have used
the late election in Indianapolis. It
was a' question of measures not men.
It was frequently urged during th e campaign
that Mayor: Denny's opponent was an esti
mable gentleman and doubtless such was the
case. He, however, represented a bad cause.
He stood as the friend and representative of
fc. tally-sh eet forgers, ballot-box stuffers and the
whisky ring, and yet he received the support
of a large number of respectable citizens be-
r. -
cause he was himself personally worthy. This
remarkably sensible preacher merely advises
young men to associate themselves with a po
litical party, the choice to be made deliber
ately and with regard to the principles involved.-.
The 'tendency at present is to "independ
ence," but the greatest results of stateman
ship are accomplished not by individual but
by party action, as the history of this country
and others will show. The sermon was a
timely one, and is of a sort to bear repetition.
The report of the Interstate-commerce
Commission cites as a striking proof of the
recklessness of railroad management that 103
roads, representing a mileage of 11,060, are
now in the hands of receivers, who man
age them under the direction of courts. These
receivership roads are largely wild-cat con
cerns and , represent the speculative era of
railroad building. That era, though meas
urably past, is liable to be revived by circum
stances and. past experience suggests the
wisdom of guarding against it, as far as pos
sible, by preventive legislation. On thi3
point the commissioners say: "So serious has
been the evil'-of bringing worthless schemes
into existence and making them the basis for
an appropriation of public moneys, or for
the issue of worthless evidences of debt, that
a number of States have so amended their
constitutions as to take from the Legislature
the power either to lend the credit of the
State in aid of corporations proposing to con
struct railroads, or to authorize municipal
bodies to render aid, either money or credit.
State legislation has at the same time been
in the direction of making compulsory the
actual payment of a bona fide capital before
a corporation shall be at liberty to test the
credulity of the public by an issue of negotia
ble securities." There are several railroad
enterprises cow soliciting township subscrip
tions in this State. We have no information
as to the character or probable outcome of
these schemes, but past experience would
suggest at least a reasonable degree of caution
in dealing with them. Itis much easier for a
township or other municipality to vote a sub
scription than it is to pay itj and, while they
may get their money's worth, they may be
sadly disappointed. There is a class of sharp
ers who make a business of projecting new
Mnes of railroad, getting rights of way and
local subscriptions for no other purpose than
to speculate upon, and as a rule they have no
scruples about sacrificing local interests.'
These gentlemen will bear watching. .
We seem to have heard something of
Thomas Jefferson as one of the founders of
the Democratic party. An examination of
the record shows that in his last annual
message as President, delivered Nov. 8, 1808,
Mr. Jefferson said:
"The probable accumulation of the sur
pluses of revenue beyond what can be applied
to the payment of the public debt, whenever
the freedom and safety of our commerce shall
be restored, merits the consideration of Con
gress. Shall it lie unproductive in the public
vaults? Shall the revenue be reduced? Or
shall it not rather be appropriated to the im
provement of roads, canals, rivers, education
and other great foundations of prosperity and
union under the powers which Congress may
already possess, or such amendment to the
Constitution as may be approved bv the
States?"
The gentleman wLi now occupies the
White House should ponder on this, and the
next time he undertakes to play at statesman
ship it may supply him the clew for an idea.
In the London cable special to the New
York Herald we find a number of such pleas
ant and suggestive paragraphs as these:
"Every provincial town and local paper
states that America has turned free-trader,
and great is their joy; great is the reputation
of Cleveland, and blessed is his name."
"To convert the United States is indeed a
triumph. The pCobden Club will henceforth
set up a special shrine for the worship of
President Cleveland and send him all its
publications gratis. Cobden founded free
trade; Cleveland saved it. Such is the
burden of the song all through England to
day." v
"All sorts iof theories are afloat about
America coming round to free trade. - Soon
English goods will go to your ports duty free,
and Cleveland's statue will be erected by the
side of Cobderr'3."
And again we take occasion to remark that
a platform that is so popular in Great Britain
will not be the best on which any man or any
party can make a canvass for the office of
President of the United States.
The record will be shown that a great many
Republicans declared for a reduction of the
revenue, as did Mr. Sherman, and now they
will be required to face the music The
Sentinel.
The Republicans are in favor of a reduc
tion of the revenue. The last national plat
form declared a3 follows:
"The Democratic party has failed completely
to relieve the people of the burden of
unnecessary taxation by a wise reduction of
the surplus.' The Republican party pledges
itself to correct the irregularities of the tariff
and to, reduce the surplus."
The Republican party stands just there to
day,?and will continue so to stand. It favors
the reduction of the revenue and the conse
quent reduction of the surplus; but that
reduction is to be made by the friends of
protection to American labor, and not by
those who believe that protection, as repre
sented in a tariff, is "organized robbery."

The trial of RL Harper was a model for
judicial imitation from beginning to end.
There was no delay in the proceedings, no
lagging of the wheels of justice, and no waste
of time on side issues. Yet the trial was con
ducted in so fair and impartial a manner as
to extort ; the praise of defendant's counsel.
When the verdict was rendered, sentence was

cover the "great interest" of "labor" in the

The friends of the Hont Ruf us Magee will be
pleased to read the following letter from the
Minister of Foreign Affairs to 'the minister of
Sweden and Norway at Washington. It is an
unusual but gratifying and complete answer to
the outrageous scandals that have been circu
lated about Mr. Magee: '
"STOCKHOLii, Nov. 3, 1887."
"My Dear Mr. Beuterskiold': 3
- "My attention has been ?d$awn to an article
purporting to be a correspondence from Stock
holm, which has been published in the New
York paper, the 'World,; for October 16. Thi3
article, which I have no hesitation in describing
as a piece of mendicious 'scurrility, contains a
most violent aspersion upon the character of the
representative of the United States at this
capital, and 1 feel bound in justice to Mr. Magee,
with whom I have entertained, for the past
two years, pleasant official and social relations,
to raise my voice against Xtie annoymons calum
nies of which he has been 'the subject.
"The essential part of the charge against Mr.
Magee is that his conduct here has not been in
harmony with the dignity attached to his posi
tion. It is asserted thathe acted in a ridiculous
and unbecoming way on" the occasion of his
presentation to the King? that he shows eccen
tricity in his dress; tha, his residence is far
away from the residence quarter of the city,
and that Swedish society have stopped their
social intercourse with him. If these state
ments were not put in so malicious a form as to
seriously injure Mr. Magee if left uncontradict
ed, I should think them too ridiculous to de
serve any answer, or even notice. They are all
a pure invention from begining to end. Mr. Ma
gee's official reception at .the court took place in
exactly the same way.as that of any other di
plomate of his rank, and his social position is
and always has been excellent. Indeed, his
modest and unassuming bearing has won him
the good opinion of Stockholm society, and I
doubt whether any American has enjoyed a
better position than he.
"Of Mr. Magee's private establishment I have
no personal knowledge, but I know that his
residence is located in one of the most fashion
able parts of the town, and I am credibly in
formed that he entertains in the best style and
on a liberal scale. In the society of Stockholm
he is a frequent and welcome guest.
'Of the charge that Mr. Magee does not pay
his bills, I would say that tradespeople are
apt to complain to the Foreign Office with or with
out reason, if any bills of theirs are left unpaid
by foreign daplomates, but no such complaint has
been brought forward here against Sir. Magee,
or even hinted at in connection with his name.
The other charges, that of his taking commis
sions, etc., are so absurd that they are laughed
to scorn by every one acquainted with Mr. Ma
gee. "The whole thing seems to have been started
on the strength of statements from two men,
one of whom is a dismissed servant, and the
Other is not unknown to the Stockholm police.
At this place, the attack has produced nothing
but indignation against its authors, but it may
be different in other places where Mr. Magee is
less well known, and I therefore think it right
that you should hand a copy of this letter to Mr.
Bayard, authorizing him to make use of it as he
may deem fit.
"1 seize this opportunity to assure you, my
dear Mr. Reuterskiold, of my high consideration.

E The "drummer" who makes his complaint in
another column has, without doubt, a ground
for his grievance, but he is a little too sweeping
in his condemnation of papers "all over the
country." Drummers, like every other class
of bright, wide-awake, intelligent men, orig
inate many good stories which go the rounds for
the public to enjoy, but the stereotyped fling
and slur to which he refers have gone the way
of the mother-in-law joke, and only slip into the
reputable newspaper when the responsible edi
'tor is off duty. In Indianapolis, where so many
traveling salesmen find their homes, the name
"drummer" is synonymous with respectability,
and they are recognized and valued as most de
sirable residents and public-spirited citizens
Indianapolis, indeed, has a decided partiality for
drummers, and will gladly receive more of them

The Springfield Republican, after , reading

ure and great talent is to descend to the level
of brutish lives and work with such men in
stead of raising them up; that "to do so delib
erately, as the end of all effort and the attain
ment of life, is a cowardly abandonment of op
portunity, only parponable to a madman or a
Russian." ' Now, what will novelist Howells
say to this attack upon his idol?

economic organic whole, self relating and seli
sustaining, in which there is constantly in prog
ress the developement of new industries. The
United States under free trade would be a
great slaughter-house of industry, in which the
products of cheap labor would destroy domestic
enterprise. This has been the lesson of the
past, and this will be the lesson of the future if
the advice of Mr. Cleveland is followed. Phila

There should be a systematic attempt to im
part moral instruction in the public schools of
every state and Territory, m some Estates tne
Canadian plan of using Bible selections, includ
ing moral and didactic chapters agreed upon by
Catholic and Protestants, might be copied. In
others, should this plan prove impracticable.
some simplified code of moral philosophy, which
is now taught is one torm or anotner in au tne
higher institutions, might be introduced. One
thing that is wanted very much is the cultiva
tion of a keener sense of the rights of others,
and the practice of a greater respect for those
rights. This respect is of the first importance
to republican institutions, and its teaching has
as legitimate a place in public instruction as
geography, arithmetic or spelling. New York

HOW TIIK LITERATI LAUGH.
Lowell, Stoddard, Twain, Cable and Others
Entertained by the FoetKiley.
New York Commercial Advertiser.
One of the most amusing things, besides hear
ing James Whitcomb Riley recite, the other
evening at Chickenng Hall," was to watch how
the big literary lichts were affected by the
inimitable "Hoosier" poet. James Russell Low
ell, the Right Rev. II. C Potter. Mark Twain,
Dr. Edward E(?gleston, R. II. Stoddard. H. C
Bonner, and Geo. W. Cable all had read or re
cited their pieces on the proeramme when Mr.
Riley was announced. He came forward with a
luminous smite on his mobile, jovial face, but
toned up hia Prince Albert coat, looked at the
highly intellectual audience, composed mostly
of ladies, and said he would recite a poem
called. "When the Frost is on the Pumpkin."
just as the old farmer was supposed to
have spoken. The laughter began
as soon as he repeated the first
line and continued until he finished. Mr.
Lowell, as chairman of the meeting, tried to
look as calm and unmoved as possible, but his
companion. Bishop Potter, could not repress
his risibility, and 'joined in the fun with grace
ful dignity. Mark Twain's face resembled the
diagram of a five-act comedy in blank verse,
whiie Dr. Eggleston's high tufted hair worked
backward and forward as if the wind of humor
had a contract to blow through his tangled locks.
Poet Stoddard crossed his legs and laughed un
til the tears ran down his face and were soaked
up by his snow white beard. Mr. Banner's
black side whiskers ceased to look staid and
prim, ai.d joined his smiles in a bolero of al
most unrestrained cachinnation, and as for
Mr. Cable, be put off for a moment his Tremont
Temple Sunday-school air and roared, not
in his favorite patois of the Cre
ole, bat in common everyday English.
Bill Nye, Mr. Riley's side partner, merely cork
screwed a dry grin on his noble facade, and
kept it there at equal temperature during all
the fan. Toward the last of the '"Hoosier" co
median's recital the glacial dignity of" Mr. Low
ell melted somewhat, and he put bis hand to bis
face and quietly beamed several ripples of en
joyment from his half-closed eyes. Mr. Riley's
power to create fun was not gauged when big
name was placed on. the programme, or else
these distinguished literati would have been
prepared, and not taken front seats on the
stage. Major Pond, who is somewhat of a
prophet, remarked carelessly before the authors
met that Riley would take the "bean" easily.
If the bean meant to create the most amuse
ment and delight an audience as it had never
been before, he certainly deserved that richest
and rarest of Boston dishes. His personation
of the "educator"" was a a decided hit also.
A Compliment from Mr. Lowell.
New York Critic.
At the close of the second day's reading of the
authors Mr. Lowell paid a graceful tribute to
Mr. James Whitcomb Riley, who had read with
great success the previous afternoon. It was
particularly flattering to the Hoosier dialed
poet as the expression of a master in dialect
verse-writing as well as in higher branches of
the poetie art. Mr. Lowell said:
"1 want to thank the audience for its kind at
tendance and earnest attention, without which
these readings could not have been a success. I
also wish to thank Mr. Riley, who has so gener
ously consented to favor us again to-day with
one of his delightful poems. Since yesterday's
reading I have been enjoying a book of .Mr. Ri
ley's poems, and I have been so impressed with
the tenderness and beauty of the more serious
onee that I hope he will repeat one of these now.
Bat whether it be one of these or something
else I am sure it will be something good.
GOV. GREEN 1ISPLEASEX.
He Thinks the President lias Gone Too Far
la the Direction of Free Trade.
Trenton Special.
Gov. Robert S. Green is another of the lead
ing Jersey Demoerats who are said to be not at
all satisfied with President Cleveland's message.
He doesn't care to talk very much about it, but
it is declared that he privately admits that the
President has gone too far in the free-trade di
rection. The Governor while in Congress always
stood band in hand with Samuel J. Randall and
William McAdoo on the tariff question. He is a
moderate protectionist, and knows how fatal
even a diluted free-trade policy would be in New
Jersey. The Governor favors the abolition of
the internal revenue tax so far as possible in
order to reduce the surplns, but he is against
radical redaction of the tariff.
. The Governor's views are those held by nearly
every prominent Democrat in this State whom
your correspondent has seen. The Democratic
organs have ransacked the State for expressions
favorable to the message, but outside of a few
insignificant politicians they have not re
cessful in their quest. Not a single Demoerarie
manufacturer has been induced to indorse the
message, and no amount of party pressure will
be able to brine them around to the free-trade
views taken by the administration.
Hon. Hugh BlcCnlloch on the Surplus.
Talk In New York.
I do not believe ocr importation will be so
heavv in the future, and our appropriations will
doubtless be more liberal. There is ample room
in this broad country just at this time for the
legitimate expenditure of large sums of money.
I do not think that so much stress should be
laid upon the subject of the accumulation of
money in the Treasury. Too much importance
is attached to the cry about this gigantic surplus
or ours. In my opinion the .New ork Stock
Exchange is responsible for the anxiety which
the people feel on this point, and which is by no
means justified by the present condition of af
fairs. I have never in the course of my expe
rience known the price of American produce te
be low for lack of money to buy it. Our pro
duction has frequently forced prices down, but
lack of money never. The present cry for more
money comes from the speculators, and should
not be heeded. I regard it as a most unfortunate
thing that the questions of our financial policy
cannot be divorced from party politics. There
is little to be hoped for in the' way of reform in
any direction when the issues involved are
drawn strictly upon party lines. With all due
respect to Congress, I do not think that body is
properly constituted to determine tho- ques
tions which should be considered without regard
to politics or individual constituencies. An in
dependent commission to examine into the op
eration of existing laws and formulate the prod
er legislation might be productive of good re
sults. Tlil Brutal Boycott.
St. Louis Globe-Sbmocrat.
The brutality of the boycott system has been
repeatedly illustrated Bat the recent case of
Joseph Johoda, expelled from the Cigar makers'
Union, shows the system exactly as it neenj to
be seen. The poor fellow was a bunch-maker "or
roller of leaves. Either innocently or by his
connivance, he was working at 1 cent per hun
dred under union prices. It is claimed that the
single eold cent was absorbed by the men over
him. But he was kicked out of the union as a
ecab, and work was refused him everywhere.
He sought it in every direction for weeks, bat
the boycott was not to be broken through.
There was no mercy to be meted. Had capital
ists treated a laborer in this manner there would
have been more anarchic howls perhaps bomb
throwing. But this was the work of the labor
ers, and therefore assumed to be right The
man walked the streets, begging for work, un
til he was half starved, weak and despairing.
He then hung himself. No matter about who
was guilty, it was the work of cowardice and
selfishness. It was the application of a princi
ple that we must never see generally applied.
nnlnss we wish to live under an oligarchy or
Hosts and his allies. Let selfish capitalists be
exposed; but this is the murderous selfishness of
labor. Both sides must have a hearing, gentle
men.
An Outside View of a Bully.
Louisville Commercial.
Green Smith, of Indiana, has confessed to an
interviewer that he would accept the Democratic
nomination for Governor. Smith is very serious
about thip, but it must make the sides of the
Hoosier State ache with laughter. The De
mocracy of Indiana will acknowledge its inability
to control affairs wben a fellow of Smith s men
tal and moral calibre is called to lead them.
His course in the senatorial fight between
Harrison and Turpie proved him to be more of
a bruiser than a statesman. He showed an
utter disregard for honest methods. He was
willing to sacrifice every principle to secure a
temporary party advantage. His rulings were
purposely unfair. He answered opposition by
brut force, and used no argument where an ex
hibition of physical strength would suffice.
Green Smith is devoid of anility. Upon the
stump he would be a failure. If chosen Gov
ernor he he would disgrace his party by his acts.
Indiana has too many able and reputable Demo
crats within her borders for a gubernatorial
nomination to be wasted on a mediocre fellow
like Smith. His nomination would certainly
mean his defeat.
Mr. Randall's Protection.
Interview with Mr. Teck, of Illinois.
Mr. Randall replied that he had a great de
sire to see more of th e West. He then went on
to speak frankly of his position on industrial
questions and the tariff.
"I expect," said ne to air. i-ecsr, - tnat i ra.
more of a protectionist at heart than either
von or the Senator here, Mr. Plumb. "The
fact is," he continued, "hardly any of ns realize
what a big and diversined country we nave got.
It seems to me that we ought to be independent
of the rest of the world. I think the time has
come for ns to raise and make about everything
we have any need of. I am in favor of a policy
which encourages and develops th5s idea of n-
tional independence. That is the kind of a pro
tectionist I am."
Mr. Randall went on in an earnest manner to
defend his position on broad grounds. He
artrued that patriotism and statesmanship dic
tated the course which diversified interests, de
veloped the national resources, and encouraged
the greatest possible variety of industries.
