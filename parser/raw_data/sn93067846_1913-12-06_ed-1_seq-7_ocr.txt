Washington. Dec. 2.?President
Wilson today laid hffofj conuress the
legislative gjahlUoi of the Demo
ggfgtjgfj administration.
For nearly 2ti minutes the president
stood before thi assembled senate and
house in the chamber of the latter
and read his first annual message.
Applause punctuated important utter?
ances, and when he had finished there
waa an enthaniastle demonstration,
with handclapping and cheers. Brief?
ly, the president outlined a programme
for ?k>' ial Justice and the general wel?
fare of the nation, ami proclaimed
the aspiration* of the United States
Cor international amity and the main?
tenance of corstitutional government
in all America.
With close, aloioai eager attention,
memhsrs of the t ?. houses listened
and time and again the legislatora
gave vent to their enthusiasm along
with the crowded galleries.
Lea* than 3,000 words long, the
message was one of the briefest and
moat novel of American state papers
?a marked contrast, as presented by
Its author today, to the hitherto
lengthy documents averaging 20,000
words or more, droned through by a
reading clerk to an inattentive con
green.
There wae another contrast con?
spicuously apparent.
President Wilson had read three
message* before?on the tariff, the
currency und Mexican affaira The
first time ho addressed a Joint Bos?
sier In person, early In this term,
there wae an atmosphere of stiff
torr. \ahtv. applause was liberal, but
perfunctory, and there was an inde?
finable air of precedent being broken
?or a century-eld custom being re?
vised. There was an expectant cu?
riosity as to how the president would
be received. Today the presidents
reception was warm, almost uproar?
ious, as he concluded his reading.
Later, Republicans and Democrats
alike pronounced the message as the
utteiance of a statesman.
"I like the idea of the president
coming before congress." said Repre?
sentative Mann. Republican house
leader, "and reading a short mes?
sage, pithy and to the point. In the
main I liked the message today. I
think everybody will recognize it as
the utterance of a statesman, regard?
less of whether he agrees with its de
Ulla"
Of particular significance was one
outburst of applause regarded in the
national capital tonight?the unmis?
takable approval that greeted the
president's remark:
"There can be no certain prospect
of peace In America until Gen. Huerta
has sjrrendered his usurped authority
In Mexico."
Among those who would discuss
the message in congress there was a
general indorsement of the adminis?
tration's policy towards .Mexico.
The scene of toJay's function was
much the same as on the three pre?
vious occasions when President Wil
* n h i.h ,i.bl(.s>, d congress?galleries
crowded with men and women of Im?
portance In public affairs, members
of tho cabinet, the diplomatic corps
and tho White House family.
Democratic leaders were enthusias?
tic in their comments on the message
and its recommendations. They liked
the emphasis placed by the president
on the need for early action on the
currency, for dealing with monopoly I
through anti-trust legislation, the im?
portance of rural credit legislation to
benefit tbe farm* rs. the recommenda?
tion for government construction of
railroads in Alaska, the development
of the nation s resources by a conser?
vation policy alike acceptable to the
glates and the federal authorities^ tin
enactment of employers liability leg
?station and the selection of presiden?

QnjgfJsJ Services or Thanksgiving
Mark Great Occasion for Faitliful
Flock.
Ihshopville, Dec. 2.?.Sunday was a
day lung to be remembered by the
Presbyterians of this town and their
friends ol the city and county, in that
it was the 76th anniversary of the
organizing and erecting here of the
church of that faith.
This being the case, the o Ulcers,
pastor and members thought it proper
to have a special service for the an?
niversary, the service being a ming?
ling of thanksgiving and jubilation,
the occasion being the burning of a
mortgage that has long stood over the
magnificent new church erected by
the people a few years ago.
This church has a remarkable his?
tory In several wuys. It has been a
regularly organized church for 76
years and In that time it has had but
two church buildings und but four
pastors, one of ?hese, the present pas?
tor, the Uev. L. L. Legtera, to whom
more than any other one man the
success of this celebration is duo.
It has another unique record in
that it had one man to serve as or?
ganist for almost 40 years?George
II. Held, who retired from this posi?
tion just a year or so ago?and that
\V. R. Law for more than 3& years
was a member of the choir, for a part
of that time tho entire direction ot
the singing devolving upon him.
The only sad note in this glad oc?
casion was tho announcement that
after this service Mr. Law would re-j
tire as chorister, he having been i
lorced to do this, much to the re
gret of the church, on accouut of
failing eyesight.
The programme of exercises, sig?
nificant and inspiring, was one of
unusual interest.
It follows:
Anthem, "Great Is the Lord;" dox
ology; Invocation; hymn 196; Scrip?
ture; prayer; hymn 32; announce?
ments; anthem, "I Lay My Sins on
Jesus;" historical address, tho Rev.
Hugh R. Murchlson; burning of the
mortgage; anthem, "Come Holy
Spirit;" address, "The Future," tho
ItejY, W. F. Gregg; greeting, the Rev.
II. (\ Hammond; hymn IS j benedic?
tion.
Mr. Murchison's address was enjoy?
ed by all and was in many respects a
ie\elati n to the members themselves,
i'ho historical incidents of greatest ln
u rest wer? that part of tho history of
h? church ante-dating the freedom
of tho slaves, there being read from
he record the names of several ne?
groes as having been received into
?.he membership of the church. He
told the exceedingly interesting story)
of the immigration of Scotch-Irish
to South Carolina in 1730, of the es
I itdishment of a Presbyterian church
at Kingstrce, of another at Indian
town, of its further spread up Mack
river to Salem (B. R.) church, then
Mt. Zlon in Lee county, the real
mother of the Dlshopvllle church, and
finally of the organizing and building
in this church, in 1838.
Many accounts read from the
permanent records of the church
show how strict were those of the
earlier times. Several members were
tried for conduct unbecoming mem?
bers of the church and hi some cases
were convicted and expelled from the
church.
Tho BlshopNillo Presbyterians {
within tho short space of throe years,
have built, at a cost of over $25,0uu,
a magnlllcent church building, the
burning of the mortgage during yes?
terday's QggfOlgSg marking the llnal
payment of the cost of building the
DOW church. Within the short period;
of one year, since October, till, this'
harch has erected a handsome new
manse, :tu rOOOOd Its fclfts to ull other
?Muses, paid the debt on the church
and Contributed Ig cash almost $1,0U0
i month in that time. All this has
teen done by tho representatives of
Just .">1 families which compose the
membership of this church, none of
whom can rightly be nailed wealthy.
This church has given to the min?
istry and missionary gold several ol
its sons .nid dnuihtere.
The pi ? sent pastor of the church,

of the success of thli celebration is

Message.
Washington, Dec. aV?Fear of hring?
ing on a revolt that might give Amer?
ica a militant suffragist organization
today caused leaders in the National
American Woman Suffrage associa?
tion to abandon their efforts to have
' adopted by the convention a new Con?
stitution reported by a revision com
J mittee appointed a year ago. Advo?
cates for rights for State associations
?and opponents of the proposed budget
I system for raising the national organ-1
{ ization's funds, emphatically declined 1
j to accept the recommendations and j
i linally the draft was referred back
I to the committee with instructions
Ithat a compromise be prepared.
Today's sessions were devoted to
i dismission of the proposed revision of i
! the constitution. The question was I
debated lor nearly six hours without
bitterness or personalities, and the
contest linally resulted In a draw.
Dr. Anna Howard Shaw, president I
I of the association, created a sensa?
tion at tonight's session when she de?
clared that President Wilson had fall?
en short of the greatest opportunity j
he ever had or ever would have in t
falling to say a word in behalf of wo-j
man suffrage today when he read his
annual message to congress. Her re?
marks provol d loud and prolonged
applause.
Dr. Shaw said she hoped the pres-1
Idcnt would arise to the occasion, but
that while he had recognized tho
necessity for the extension of the bal?
lot to the Filipinos and urged terri?
torial rights Cor Alaska, he had failed
to mention woman suiVrugo in his
message,
When Dr. Shaw concluded the con?
vention, amid enthusiastic cheering,
adopted by acclamation tho following
H solution introduced by Dr. J. Wil?
liam Funk of Baltimore.
? Resolved, That in the sense of this
meeting ihat President Wilson failed
to rise to the sublimest heights of
democracy when he failed ii. his mes
cage to congress today to recommend
the freedom of half the citizens of the
Inited States and pr?bably half the
citizens of the civilized world."
Efforts to get some expression of
opinion from President Wilson on the
suffrage queetlon may be made before
the convention ends next Friday.
"Women and Children and the
Courts," was the general topic on
which the ddresses tonight dealt.
Mrs. Joseph T. iiowen and Chief Jus?
tice Harry Olsen of Chicago, and
Miss Maude Miner of New York were
the speakers.
The delegates tonight wire looking
forward with eager anticipation to]
the hearing they are to be given to
morrOW before the house rules com- j
mittee on the proposal to create a|
woman suffrage committee in the J
house, similar to that In the senate. j

ly injured and over a score slightly

BETTER ROADS IN STATE.
Provisions of Byrnes Bill for Co-op
oration With the Federal Govern?
ment, i
Washington, Dec. 2.?Representa?
tive James F. Byrnes today introduc?
ed a bill for co-operation between the
Federal and State governments in
road building. He would apportion
the Federal aid thus: One-third in
the proportion which the area of the
State bears to the area of the United
States; one-third in the proportion
which the mileage of rural delivery
star routes in the State bears to that
of the whole country, and the remain?
ing one-third in the proportion which
the population of the State bears to
that of the whole country.
The bill provides that to get Fed?
eral aid a State must itself appro?
priate a sum greater than that con?
tributed to it by the Federal govern?
ment. The total appropriation by the
government is to be $3,000,000 the
llrst year; $6,000,000 the second, and
$12,000,000 each year thereafter.
Mr. Byrnes believes that South Car?
olina and other Southern States would
derive more benefit under this plan
than under the provisions of the
Sbackloford bill, and a number of his
colleagues on the committee on roads
agree with him. ? Senator Gore, chair?
man of the senate committee on agri?
culture', and Began W. Page, director
of the public roads division of the de?
partment of agriculture, also favor a
bill drawn on the lines followed by
Mr. Byrnes.

Assert Their Church is Now With?
in the Law.
Pittsburgh, Dec. l.?The fifth an?
nual convention of the National Re?
form association convened here to?
day and the first session in which
"Mormonism" was the subject occa?
sioned a lively debate. Prof. O. F.
Bavis of New Richmond, Whi, chair?
man of the world commission on Mor?
monism, introduced a resolution,
which was adopted, calling upon con?
gress to prohibit polygamy in all the
States of America, territories and de?
pendencies. EL Murray Stewart of
Ambridge, Pa., a missionary of the
Church of Christ of the Latter Day
Saints, immediately objected.
"Such an amendment is not neces?
sary to the laws rf our country," he
said. "For polygamy is not and has
not been practical in Utah or any
other State since 1890."
Dr. William Paeden of Salt I^ake
City answered Mr. Stewart's objec?
tions.
"I have lived for 15 years among
the Mormons and I know that they
fear the adoption of that amendment
to the United States constitution more
than any other amendment ever sug?
gested. As for the assertion of Mr.
Stewart, that polgymay has not been
practiced since 18 90?the year of the
Woodruff manifesto?I have here aj
picture showing Joseph Smith and j
his wives at d their children taken in;
the >ear ||M2. ts that not enough'
proof that polygmuy has boon prac?
ticed since the issuance of that man?
ifesto?"
Leonard Burdick, also a missionary
of th? Church of Christ of the Lat?
ter Day Saints, said the church was
ready at any time to disprove the
charges of polygamous actions of the
Mormons.
CHILD LABOR LAW HOLDS.
Supremo Court Sustains Kentucky
Grain Hates?Must Pay Corporation
Tax.
Washington, Dec. 2.?The Supreme
Court of the United States handed
down a number of decisions today,
some of them being of national im?
portance.
The Illinois Child Labor law was
sustained as constitutional in the case
of Arthur Beauehamp, 15 years old,
who recovered a verdict of $4,500
from the sturges & Burn Manufactur?
ing Company for having his hand
lacerated in a press. Justice Hughes
announced th? decision.
Tin* company also defended on the
ground that the boy represented that
he was more than 10 and being more
than 14, should be held responsible,
for his statement.
The court hold the company em?
ployed him at its peril.
Bates on grain and other commo?
dities over the Louisville and Nash?
ville Railroad were approved in the
so-called Kentucky State rate case.
The decision Of the Federal Court of
that State affirmed.
Tho McChord law enabling the
Kentucky State Bailroad Commission
to fix reasonable rates on intra-State
business was held valid.
The Louisville and Nashville con?
tended that the rates affected largely
grain shipped from Ohio, Indiana and
Illinois to Kentucky cities, and has
the effect of lowering inter-State rates.
Mining corporations must pay the
corpora ion tax imposed by the
Payne-Aldrlch Tariff act, according
to another decision.
Bight or ten million dollars has
t een paid to the government by such
corporations under protest, and 500
.suits and claims were started to re?
cover the money.
The court also held that the cor?
porations were not entitled to deduct
the value of ore before it was mined
I as ' depreciation."
I Chief Justice White an I Justices:
McKenni and Holmes dissented OQ
the latter point.
The uniform system of accounting
prescribed by the inter-State Com?
merce Commission for railroads was
upheld.
The Lnckawanna Railroad must pay
a $2,000 tine for transporting its own
hay to feed mules in its mines. That,
in the opinion of the supreme Court,
was a va?lation of the commodities
da igo of the Hepburn law, and s
conviction In a lower court was main?
tained.

COUNTY BOARD DESJDBS TO IM*
PROVE PRESENT QUARTERS.
Lcwnoss Of Bids Submitted Results in
Their Agi*eeing to Keep Present Jail
Property and S|>eiid Money Im?
proving; It?No Other Business ol
Importance Transacted.
At a regular meetmg of the Coun?
ty Board of Commissioners, held yes?
terday with all members present ex?
cept W. B. Cooper, who is confined to
his home hy sickness, it was decided
nipt <a> sell tho present site and quart
en- of the county jail, but instead to
spend as much as was reasonably nec?
essary for Improving the premises.
This decision came after ihe bids sub?
mitted on the present jail property,
in answer to advertisements for its
sale, had been opened. None of these
bids were anywhere near what the
commissioners thought was a lair
price for the property, and hence, al?
ter a discussion of the matter, the
board came to the. conclusion that it
would be better to keep the property.
Further than this decision, however,
no definite plans as to the extent of
the improvements were formulated.
At the last session the legislature
a resolution was passed, permitting
Sumter County to borrow $8,000 for
the county's ordinary expenses, hut
the mem be; s of the board generally
agree that this money should be used
principally for jail improvements, and
hence the probability of its 1?.ing ex?
pended in this manner.
At the meeting held yesterday no
business of importance, other than
that mentioned above, was attended
to.
