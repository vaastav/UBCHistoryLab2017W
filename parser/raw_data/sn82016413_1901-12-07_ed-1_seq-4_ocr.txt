SATURDAY DECEMBER 6, 1901.
Committeeman Stewart can con
gratulate himself on the enemies no
has made and the Adcrtlser for tha
new friends It has made for him.
Pair dealing nnd honest representa
tion Is nil that is asked of the Repub
lican Territorial committee. Accord
ing as It fulfills this reasonable re
quest the Integrity of Its members w 111
be Judged.
If Governor Dole were as certain of
serUng out his term as his friends try
to make the people think he Is tho Joy
In the ranks of political oligarchs
'would be real Instead of n weak' voiced
assumption.
American worklngmcn aro either
Republicans or Democrats. Adver
tiser. This Is nil very true, but who fur
nished the votes to elect Schmltz, May
or of San Francisco.
Grant It Is true, as claimed by the
Governor's official organ, that tho vot
ing citizenship of this Territory Is an
Irresponsible mob, the organ Is quick
to forget that mobs can be led but
never driven.
The Chief Executive of the Nation Is
ever on the lookout for men of char
acter and tho Chief Executive of the
Territory searches for men who will
bow the cringing kneo to n minority
political faction. That a the differed
ence.
The United Stntes District Attorney
nlio has enough business to keep four
attorneys busy gets about half as much
salary as tho Attorney General of the
Territory who has about enough bus!
ness to keep him decently well oxer
clsed.
There Is n faction In Hawaii posing
84 good government purists which from
Its attitude in local political affairs
must view with Jealous pride tho sue
cess of Alabama citizens In dlsfran.
chlsing the major portion of their clcc
torate.
The effort of Thurston's organ to ex
plain Us prosperity articles and mako
them consistent with the proposal to
appeal for Federal assistance Is pon
derous as usual. The newspaper put
ting Itself in the position of having to
explain, thereby acknowledges defeat.
Tho desire of J. P. Cooke and J. A.
Oilman (not a member) to hold all the
proxies In the Republican Territorial
committee Is an exhibition of deslro tn
make personal Interests secondary to
the interests of the party that should
bring tears to the eyes of the sphinx.
Business men who havo come In
contact with tho holiday trade of pre
vious seasons havo yet to discover In
this year of our Lord any of that
marked prosperity which they havo
been told exists as a result of the In
come tax, blockade In public works
and kindred blessings the Territorial
administration offers for the holiday
season.
The most malicious Hawaiian in his
most bitter moments has never done
s much townrd drawing the color Una
to the politics of this Territory as tht
official organ of Governor Dole Is
steadily attempting to do. Official an
tagonism for the Hawallans Is likely
to soon lead tho organ and its dictators
to rail at tho Almighty for having
tnado man in his own Image but of dif
fering colored skin.
The decrepit Advertiser again makes
reference to the assumed -superiority
of its circulation, but It sings low on
its refusal to accept the Bulletin's
challenge to open Its books to the busi
ness men of tho city, Tho story ho
been told before In these columns
but It Is worthy of repetition. The
Advertiser's efforts to make an Im
pression with Its circulation calls to
mind the old farmer's cow who chewed
up an umbrella and afterwards got Into
tho kitchen, nto n yeas tcuko. Tho
yeast caused tho umbrella to spread
and th ccow died In terrible agony of
expansion. If the Advertiser has any
hope of proving Its circulation to bo
larger than that of tho Bulletin It
would bo very prompt in producing tho
goods.
Harold M. Sewall's status In this
Territory Is so well understood by tha
National Republican committee and by
tho President that no nctlon of local
officials or committees or words of tho
Governor's malicious mouthpiece can
in anyway detract from his good stand
ing In national circles or lessen his
Influence. Mr. Sewall has always ex
ercised his influcnco for the advance
ment of the political and business In
terests of this Territory, and has ex
tended personal courtesies to mem
bers of tho Dole official family show
ing himself at nil times a broad mind
ed and fair minded gentleman. The
spiteful and caddish spirit with which
Dole's official organ treats Mr, Sewall
does nothing If not expose the char
acter of the gang dictating the organ's
policy.
ONE OP THE RESULTS.
The prospective alliance of the city
labor unions with the Home Rule Re
publicans may bo put down as the di
rect result of the dissensions aroused
In the regular Republican organiza
tion by tho Illegal and unprecedented
methods attempted by the Dole faction
nnd the general blocakdc of Territorial
business occasioned by tho refusal of
tho Governor to follow tn eplaln duty
of a chief cxccutUc In-obtaining funds
through legal methods. '
This coalition of tho labor men with
the Home Rule organization strength
ens an already forcible sign of thn
times which Is none other than that a
large majority of tho so-called foreign
ers arc so disgusted with the Dole ad
ministration's retrogressive policy of
expedients that rather than endorse
the Dolo party directly or indirectly
they will oto a straight Hawaiian
American ticket. Such nn outfome tho
regular organization may expect If
tho present administration policy con
tinue. Tho union men of Honolulu nre men
of Intelligence. They followed the de
liberations of tho Loglslnturo and the
attitude of the Governor closely. They
hae heard alt tho arguments "Ills
friends" nnd tho Governor havo to
offer against the Legislature and Hawaiian-American
torsj they have
listened to the wholesalo condemnation
meted out by tha Dole official organs
to any citizen who presumes to opposo
the Dole mandates.
The labor unions have studied the
whole situation, and what Is the re
sult They appeal for representation In tho
deliberations of the Homo Rule Re
publican party.
The Governor's organ says the work
tngmen won't mix with tho Hawaiian
Americans. This has yet to bo proved.
The fact Is that the support which the
regular organization ought to hae has
gone over to tho Homo Rulers
for no other reason thnn lack of con
fidence In If not disgust for the
present Territorial administration of
which Governor Dolo is tho head.
Such a result the Governor has been
warned ngalnst, not by "his friends"
who uphold lilm In his present conten
tion but by lionest men of the Repub
lican party who placo party welfare
above personal Interests. These men
have urged that tho Governor work
with the people, not spending his time
defying tho people and bending his
energies to defeat their obvious man
date. FACT8 ABOUT PROXIES.
The question of proxies brought up
tn tho Republican committee Is dealt
with by the Dolo faction ns a thing of
beauty and a Joy forever, especially
when possible promtso Is offered that
some of Dole's "friends" may bo able
to secure, through threat, cajolery or
plantation Influence, a controlling vulro
In tho sessions of tho party organiza
tion. As usual, mothods of fairness do
not appeal to the sense of the poli
tical minority which voices Dolo sen
timents. They sec an opening for a
possible, temporary gain and rush In
like greedy wolves with no considera
tion for the general welfare of the par
ty or Its position before tho people as
shown by tho character of the organ
ization deliberations.
The Territorial committee Is made
up of thirty members, twelve from the
two districts of Oahu, six from Maul,
eight from Hawaii and four from
Kauai. Experience has Bhown that tho
members from Oahu are practically the
only active members of tho committee
and more often than not the members
of the country districts on this Island
nre not present nt committee meetings.
Kuual has never been represented In
committee meeting except by proxy.
Maul Is fortunate In having Judge Ke
polkal, for the time being resident in
Honolulu, and H. P. Baldwin is often
nble to bo present although ho Is by
no means a regular attendant. Ha
waii Is seldom If ever represented by
any one of Its commltteo men In per
son. Thus It Is that twelve or moro of
the members arc almost Invariably
represented by proxy If at all. A ma
jority constitutes a quorum and under
the present rules of the committee It
Is not Impossible for all eighteen
proxies to bo placed In one man's
bands who with the chairman and two
additional members to keep up appear
ances can hold sessions, pass resolu
tions and conduct the whole organi
zation of tho party.
Such management would undoubt
edly be according to the political Ideas
of the Thurston-Dolo faction but It
needs no extensive argument with fair
men and honest men to demonstrate
tho utter folly of Buch management
nnd Its certainty of bringing destruc
tion to tho party. The deliberations
of the rommlttco which are now far
from being a lovo feast would bocome
a howling farce and a by-word
throughout tho Territory.
What evory man who has a tltho of
Interest In the welfnro of tho party Is
seeking Is a solution that will preserve
tho general representation in tho com
mittee and prevent one man power
whether that power be In tho hands of
r, Dolclto or nn antl-Dolclte or, as
would bo possible under the plan for
which J. P, Cooko stands sponsor. In
the hands of an outsider, Democrat or
Homo Ruler, who has never been
elected to tho commltteo but takes
part In its deliberations through his
ability to obtain a proxy.
Tho only method by which any rea
sonable degreo of balance of power or
fairness can bo preserved Is through
the limitation of tho proxies held by
one member and the further limitation
of tho proxy holders to the members
of tho commltteo.
This principle, was adopted so far as
tho Executivo committee Is concerned
at tho last session of the Terrltorlil
commltteo when the following rulo wa
adopted:
Resolved, That tho following rulo be
adopted, namely: That members of
the Executive Commltteo absent from
Honolulu may be represented by proxy,
by members of the Territorial Com
mltteo not already members of the
Executive Committee, provided that
no member shall Hold more than one
proxy for tho Executivo Committee:
All rules or parts of rules inconslat-
cnt with this rulo are hereby rescind
ed." To complete the principle and to se
cure fair representation In tho
Territorial committee as well as the
Executive body Committeeman Stew
ait presented the following:
''Resolved, That a proxy may bo
used at any committee meeting of the
Tenltorlal committee, but no proxy
shall be used except by a member of
the Territorial committee, and no
member shall hold more than two
proxies."
This proposal to confine proxies to
members of tho Territorial rommlttco
and mako two proxies tho limit of une
member's holding Is what meeln the
stl unions opposition of tho Dele fac
tion. Tho Dole faction's endeavor to force
one man power on the committee and
place proxies In the hands of men not
members of the lommlttce Is as clear
us day. If this principle Is carried
out It mnkes no difference whether
ono man power Is In the hands of a
Dole minority or nn nntl-Dole majority
it will alienate voters from the party
nnd destroy confidence In tho motives
of its organization. Such a result Is
what the Dole following has been con
sistently striving for since tho party
was organized. Thcro aro enough
honest men In tho party, however, to
picscrve Its Integrity and It Is their
duty to bo up and doing to defeat the
malicious Intrigues of a minority sec
tion acting for Dolo and Ihurston who,
falling to control hope to destroy.
United States Senator Prltchard of
South Carolina has been set forth by
the secretary of the South Carolina
Republican executivo committee as
tho great family Senator of tho Nation
Prltchard Is a Republican and as thcro
It no prospect of his serving n second
term it Is claimed that he distributing
his patronage among his relatives.
The secretary's statement shows that
thirty appointments made on the re
commendation of Prltchard aro dis
tributed among five families all related
to him. As an artist In the family com
pact business Prltchard has shown
himself worthy of a high station In tht
official life of Hawaii.
Worklngmcn of Honolulu arc an In
telligent and sensible class of men and
they havo a memory long enough to
recall the nlco things tho Advertiser
had to say of them because they signed
the petitions supporting Judge Hum
phreys when he was so maliciously at
tacked by Thurston's Bar Association
As the worklngmen's opinion of Judge
Humphreys coincided with that of
President Roosevelt nnd Attorney Gen
eral Knox there is little prospect that
they will be Influenced by the threats
or suggestions of tho official organ In
Its support of retrogressive Territorial
polices and ono man power.
THE OLD DOUBTFUL STATES.
St. Louis Globe-Democrat.
What has become of the old quartet
of doubtful States? Thcso were New
York, New Jersey, Connecticut nnd In
diana. All of tho four have been car
ried by tho Republicans pretty con
stantly In recent years. All of them
except Indiana voted last Tuesday: The
vote which each of them cast hits
Democratic chances in each of tho near
future a hard blow. New Jersey elect
ed Stato officers. Ono branch of tho
Legislature was chosen in New York.
Connecticut had a canvass for mem
bers of a constitutional convention.
There was somo politics In the Con
necticut canvnss and the Republicans
there, as in the other two States,
gained a decisive victory.
New Jersey used to bo called a de
tached section of tho solid south. It
was almost as much of a Democratic
fastness as was South Carolina or
Mississippi. Almost any sort of a
Democrat could bo elected to anything
In New Jersey. Lincoln mado a clean
sweep of all tho frco States in 1SC0 ex
cept ono little spot. That was Now
Jersey. He got Bomo of New Jersey's
electoral oto but that was because, In
the fusion between Douglas, Bell and
Breckenrldge in that State, somo of
the coalition cut tho Bell and Breck
enrldge electors to such an extent that
four of tho Lincoln electors squeezed in
the otGer going to Douglas. On the
popular vote, however, the fuslontsts'
total was 4000 greater than the Re
publican. Only three States were car
ried by McClellan In 1864 on hlg "war
failure" platform. Ono of these was
New Jersey, and the others were Dela
ware and Kentucky. New Jersey came
to tho Republicans In 1872, but this
was because it thought Grant, the Re
publican candidate, was less of a Re
publican than was Greeley, whom the
Democrats were supporting.
All th's has been changed In recent
year?. New Jersey Is now almost aa
reliably Republican as Ohio. The same
Is true of New York. If there has been
a Stato ticket In tho field In New .York
last Tuesday, as tho legislative voto
shows, tho Republicans would havo
carried the Stato by 75,000 to 100,000.
In Connecticut, too, tho Republicans
would havo had a sweeping majority
nn n straight State contest. This Is
bignlficant. Thro are good reasons
for believing that If Indiana had voted
in the election of 1901 It would havo
given as largo a plurality for tho Re
publican ticket as It did to McKtnley In
1900. This brings up the query, what
has becomoof the doubtful States. The
Ooiihlful States arc here still but they
hao changed their location. The
('oubtful States of tho next Presidential
canvass will be south of Mason and
Dixon's line.
GOVERNOR DOLE'S POLICY.
Honolulu Republican.
Not content with tho American an
nexation of Hawaii; not content with
tho control of tho chief Kedernl offices
In the Territory; His nxccllency's n--gan
nttempts to antagonize the Ha
waiian voto from Republican political
principles; to antagonize, tho President
of tho United States; and to antagonist
tho Almighty, who created tha differ
ences In color, but who left to tho
earthly worm tho creation of a differ
ence In soul,
The man who has time on bis bands
Is a nuisance.
