Thus it would not surprise dose ob

controversies under consideration
were gathered in the end under one
blanket understanding to be trans

Although rome of those who are
I sponsoring tl.e new four-power plan ,
' I ave gone so far as to prepare a ten- |
i tative treatv draft, there arc several ?
I details on which the plenipotentiaries ;
| have not yet presented their views In 1
j their Informal exchange*. There |
i seems to he a universal confidence.!
j however, that details easily can be,
J adjusted, once the principle involved
j I.as unanimous acceptance.
Thus far Great llritain alone of
the four powers has given an "ac- I
ceptance in principle." but her del
egates like those of Ja'pan. have
cabled home for further instructions
before going into a more definitive
discussion of a treaty draft. The
Japanese and American delegates arc
preeeeding plow, apparently taking
into account the special requirements'
01 their respective governmental ,
systems, and the French are said to J
have taken very little part so far
in the conversations.
Srcrrt Carefully (Jnarded.
It was at a meeting of the "big,
three" nearly a week ag.> that the I
project is understood to have taken
.such form as to permit of its trans-i
actions to the I.oudon and Tokyo!
Foreign Offices for Instructions. What
passed at this meeting has been
carefully guarded, and until today
no authoritnt Ive spokesman would
confirm or deny the many and varied
reports of proposed "a 11 iatioes." "nn
derstangings," and "gentleman's i
agreements." The oiilciai American;
spokesman still remained silent to-I
night, but from other sources it he
came known what the American at
titude had been.
The American delegates, it was
said, had felt from the beginning of
the negotiations t>iat some form of
international concord to preserve the
pence of the Pacific wa.? one of the
developments most to be hoped for j
as a result of the Washington con
ference. The Anglo-Japanese alii- j
mice was said lo be regarded as less i
efficient for such a purpose than ,
would lie an agreement in which,
other pow< ra having extensive in-j
terests in the Pacific could Join.
\ o Alliance Possible.
<>n the other hand, the American!
group found itself bound by well- !
defined restrictions in view of the i
ci.risitutional limitations of the ex- j
<e'itive in treaty-making and the j
long-established national policy of,
non-involvement in foreign entangle-1
incuts. The foreign plenipotentiaries
are understood to have been told '
frankly that the American delega
lion could not consider any proposal j
approaching an alliance, and that!
even if such a proposal were nego. I
tinted the American Senate never]
would ratify it.
The problem th^n became a qties- !
tlon of finding silch a basis of agree
ment as would impel' Japan and j
Great llritain to abrogate the alii- j
a nee. and al the same time he assured '
of Senate ratification. At one time
a system of compulsory arbitration
treaties is said to have been consid- I
eri-<i and abandoned. in the plan !
now tinder consideration the Amer
ican delegates are understood to feel
confident of Senate support, and the ,
intimations coming unofficially ? from i
both Japanese and Mritish sources in- 1
dicate that the proposal also is re- !
coiving favorable consideration at
l.ondon and Tokyo. The position of
Franco, brought In because of her
large Interests in the Far Fast, 1*

Ill the long string of "cooling off"
In'iitips negotiated by AV. .1. Hryan
*vh?>n lio wan Secretary of State the
period of suspension of liostilitlei? for
discussion ami possible arbitration is
j Ihoii at six inontiis. The same pro
j vision ha? been suggested lit some i
| quarters for the new foilr-power
i nKreement. while from other sources
liave come proposals for a lotiiier or
| shorter period. In the main the ten
dency has bcfn to follow closely the
principles of the Bryan treaties, but
j whether the six months stipulation
! will be adopted unchanged remains
1 to be determined.
i Another point not yet entirely set
tled iM whether, like the Hryan treat
ies. the new instrument is to exempt
from the "cooling off" provision such
controverles as may Involve "na
tional honor." Among the American
delegate* there is said to be a con
viction that such disputes should not
be subjected to enforced delay and
investigation, but rather that all the
nations concerned should be left free
to net promptly in every ense where
it was considered that national honor
had been affronted.

The Irish delegates on leaving I.On

of l,onilon Irishmen and women
gathered in Huston Station. The
large force of police present tried
vainly to control the excited crowd,
but the delegates had literally to
light their way to the train.
Michael Collins especially was be
sieged by the surging masses; twelve
policemen eventually carried him
along the platform. He lost his hat

What Kind of a Day
Do You Wish Yourself?
Suppose you could make
a wish at the breakfast table
and finally have the wish come
true. Would you say,
"I want this to be a good
day," or?
"I'm willing for this day
to drag along?"
If you keep on wishing
your days with the food you
cat, finally the wish is likely
to come true.
Grape-Nuts helps your
wish for a good day. Nothing
miraculous; just the natural
result from right food with
the right taste.
There is a charm of flavor
and crispness in Grape-Nuts
that is like the smile of a good
friend at the breakfast table?
And Grape-Nuts, with
cream or milk, is fully nour- .
ishing?feeding the tissues
and glands, the bone and
blood, with just those ele
ments which nature requires
?building strength without
any "heaviness."
Grape-Nuts is the per
fected goodness of wheat and
malted barley, scientifically
developed?ready to eat from
the package.
A Grape-Nuts breakfast
or lunch is a practical wish
for good luck.
