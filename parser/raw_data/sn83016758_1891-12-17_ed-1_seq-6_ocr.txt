The Man-Eater of tlio Mississippi."
St. Louis Republic* Early writers and
travelers in the Mississippi valley tell
blood curdling stories of a terrible creature,
part bea*t, part bird, part serpent and part
man, which we are told lornierly inhabited
the bluffs and swamps of the great father of
waters between the mouths ot the Missouri
and the Des Moines rivers. Most writers of
later days are of the opinion hat such a
creature never existed, in fact, they put the
paternity oi the story on to certain Mulhat
tons who are known to have been found of
"giving to airy nothings a habitation and
a name." For moie than a century alter
the advent the white man in
the Mississippi valley stories of the "man
eater" were told and generally believed,but
sooh these were all to be denied and re
futed. Then the veiy existence of such a
creature was doubted, but there was
Father Marquette's description of the
creature to back those who still believed
that such a monstrosity had at one time
existed in what is now the Central United
States. Then another class ol wonder
mongers sprang up, who claimed to have
seen a picture painted on the bluff near
where Alton, 111., now stands. As years
A ent on even this story was denied. In
1888, when the question was up lor dis
cussion, J. R. Miles ot Miles Station, 111.,
wrote an article for the Alton Telegraph,
of which the following are ex
tracts: "I first suw the animal, it animal
it could be called, in 1833, and since that
date I have seen it from time to tim
hundreds of times before it was destro3rce
by the elements or by the hand ol man mir
ing the civil war." "The enclosed is an
exact picture ot it." Following the last
sentence quoted Mr. Miles gives a picture
the cieature, which shows it with a body
like a lion, except that the logs are very
short and the body long and lithe, like
that of the panther. Wings of a curious
pittern with eight feathers at the points
fa-ton to the shoulders and extend to be-
y.) he root of the tail, which is long and
sK'" i i seeming to be made in imitation
ot 11.at of a tiger.
The neck is very heavy, well arched and
full, surmounted by what I would take to
be a good picture ot the head ot a buck deer
of seven or eight years ol ae, the horns be
ing broad, each with four points. A.ter
giving his picture, Mr. Miles goes on to
say: "Many, many times have I examined
the picture closely, and I must say that it
is a mistake for anyone to say that it was
painted on the rocks. The bird or animal
was cut, chiseled or picked into the solid
rock, but how, when or by whom I know
not. Its body was that ot a lion, its head
and horns those of a deer and its wings
those of a bird. Draw your own con
clusions as to what it was intended to rep*
resent, but I firmly believe that the
above, a fac-simile of the 'Picture on the
Rocks,' was the handicraft and handiwork
of man, chiseled or cut into that rock to
commemorate some person or some thing.
Everybody believes that the sphinx
was built to represent a personage. Why
not believe that this mythical bird-beast
was made to represent the noble deeds of
some great person of pre-historic times in
America.''-'
With the article sent the Telegraph Mr.
Miles also inclosed a picture of the creature
described by Marquette, which is idontical
with that described aboye, with the excep
tion that it has a man's head, its feet, forn
in number, much resembling birds' claws.

his one foot in the grave, so as to be

"Oh, yes and for the moment I be

ACT IV.
"And so it means this. Oh, Rosie,
you look lovelier than ever, and I'
as happy as a king. I means this.
Your father is the greatest genius in
the world. buys my property for
60,00060,000. That's over 2,-
000 a year for me, nd he makes a
company out of it with 150,000 cap

out of it for expenses, there will be a
profit of 80,000. And all that hegives
to you80,000, that 3,000 a year
for you, and 60,000, that's 2,000
more, my dearest Rosie. Youremem
ber what you said, that when you
married you should step out of one
room like this into another iust as
good?"
"Oh, Reggie!"she sank upon his
bosom"you know I never could love
anybody buu you. It' true I was en

was only because he had one foot

went in, too just a day too soon, I
actually laughed. So the patter is

Well, I hope he won't put any of his
money into it. I'm sure, because of
late all the companies have turned
out so badly."
"But, my child, the place is full of
gold."
"Then why did he turn it into a
company, my dear boy? And why
didn't he make you stick to it! Bu
you know nothing of the city. Now,
let us sit down and talk about what
we shall dodon't, you ridiculous
boy!"
ACT V.
Another house just like the first.
The bride stepped out of one palace
into another. With their five or six
thousand a year, the young couple
could just manage to make both ends
meet. Th husband was devoted the
wife had everything that she could
wish. Who could be happier than
this pair in a nest so luxurious, their
lite so padded, their da ys so full of
sunshine?
I was a year after marriage. Th
wife, contrary to her usual custom,
was the first at breakfest. A few let
ters were waiting for herchiefly in
vitations. She opened and read them.
Among them lay one addressed to her
husband. Not looking at the address
she opened and read that as well
"DEAR REGINALD: I venture to
address you as an old friend of your
own and school-fellow of your moth
er's. I am a widow with four children.
My husband was the vicar of your old
parishyou remember him and me.
1 was left with a little income of about
two hundred a year. Twelve months
ago I was persuaded in order to double
my income a thing which seemed cer
tain from the prospectusto invest
everything in a new and rich gold
mine. Everything. And the mine has
never paid anything. The company
is called the Rynard Gold Reef Com
pany--is in liquidation because though
there is really the gold there, it costs
to much to get it out. I have no rela
tives any wThere
to help me. Unless I
can get assistance my children and I
must go once^to-morrowinto
the workhouse. Yes, we are paupers. I
am ruined by the cruel lies of that pros
fuded
iectus and the wickedness which de
me and I know not how many
others out of my money. I have been
foolish and am punished but those
people, who will punish them? Help
me if you can, my dear Reginald. Oh,
for God's sake, help my -children and
me. Help your mother's friend, your
own old friend."
"This," said Rose, meditatively, "is
exactly the kind of thing to make Reggie
uncomfortable. Why, it might make
him unhappy all day Better burn it."
She dropped the letter into the fire.
"He's of an impulsive nature, and he
doesn't understand the city. If people
are so foolish. What a lot of hbs the
poor old pat er does tell, to be sure.
He's a regular novelist. Oh, here you
are, you lazy boyf"
"Kiss me, Rosie." looked as
handsome as Apollo and as cheerful.
I wish all the world were as happy
as you and me. Heigho! Some poor
devils, I'm afraid.
