ANOTHER BIG PRODUCER PROMISED
ACCORDING to a Boston dispatch, published in The Empire
yesterday, there is a fine prospect that another big mining
company will soon be at work developing mines and erect
ing reduction works on this side of the channel in the vicinity of
Juneau. A new company is to be organized to take over the
well-known Alaska-Ebner company's holdings, with ample capital
lo do a mining business on a large scale. In view of the work
tiiat has been already accomplished in the way of developing
i hose holdings and the progress made toward effecting a re-or
ganization, there is ample reason to believe that before the be
ginning of spring another financially strong and well equipped
mining company will have invaded the Juneau gold belt.
The Juneau gold belt is commanding pre-eminent attention.
The different mining periodicals of the Pacific slope and the
East are filled these days with articles concerning the develop
ments here and in other sections of Southeastern Alaska. All
these articles are commendatory and they speak in the most con
fident terms of the mining and business future of this region, as
well as that to the Westward. It is the belief of many mining
men that this section of Alaska will, within a short time, be a
strong competitor of the Rand in gold production from quartz
mining. And the developments thus far made, coupled with those
that are promised, seem to warrant this conclusion.
PUSHING THE RAILROAD BILL.
CHAIRMAN HOUSTON, of the House Committee on Territor
ies, is anxious to have the Alaska railroad bill passed as
speedily as possible so that the President may begin to car
ry out its provisions early next spring. This is good news, in
deed, as it may be taken to reflect the views of the House major
ity a> to the necessity for the early passage of the railroad meas
ure. President Woddrow Wilson in his recent message put the
Alaska question squarely up to the Congress, and as his party
has a clear majority in both branches action is going to be had.
But the railroad bill and the solution of other Alaska questions
will receive support from Republican members of Congress, and
especially those from the Western States, many of whom are
quite well informed as to conditions in Alaska and the need of
prompt action.
In this connection it may be noted that Delegate Wicker
sham has introduced a bill in the House providing for the re
peal of the one hundred dollars a mile tax now levied on rail
roads in Alaska, and the substitution instead of a four per cent,
tax per annum on the net earnings of the railroads. This is a
step in the right direction. The tax on railroad mileage in Alas
ka has had the effect of closing down railroads which might have
been operated a part of the year at least, thus affording transpor
tation facilities to miners and prospectors. The tax has long
been considered unjust by most Alaskans who are familiar with
its operation.
HANDICAPPING WOMAN'S WORK.
ONE of the first effects of the Pennsylvania law limiting
woman's hours of work is that of handicapping her as a
competitor in the labor market, says an exchange. The
law forbids any woman employed out of her home to work more
than six days in any one week, more than ten hours in any one
day, o; more than fifty-four hours in six consecutive days. Ho
tel managers find that the handicap thus imposed renders wom
an's work in their industry unprofitable as compared with that of
men. and upward of 500 women may be dismissed from service
in the hotels of Philadelphia alone.
This is not the first time that labor statutes have had an
effect directly contrary to what was intended. It is right that
women shouid be protected from the grinding competition that
engenders sweat-shops and foul tenements and dangerous factor
ies. They have a right to every security the law can give to their
personal welfare. When, however, statutes undertake to limit
their labor, the inevitable result is a limit to their producing pow
er and a consequent loss to their economic value. They are thus
hobbled in their efforts and lose in competition with men.
There is no question of the excellence of the intent of the
framers of the statute. Public setniment in our time is weli
nigh unanimous in favor of lifting every burden possible from
overworked women. But sentiment cannot do everything. Stat
utes must be reasonable.
The celebration recently of the fiftieth anniversary of the
delivery of Lincoln's Gettysburg Address had a unique interest
among semi-centennial memorials of the Civil War. Are the
great orations of history thus celebrated in anniversary observ
ances? It gives an idea of our juster appreciation of Lincoln as
well as of our shrewder perception of values that this brief ad
dress, which passed almost unnoticed at the time but has since
come to rank as an inspired utterance, should now receive the
honor of formal celebration equally with a great battle or a trea
ty of peace.
