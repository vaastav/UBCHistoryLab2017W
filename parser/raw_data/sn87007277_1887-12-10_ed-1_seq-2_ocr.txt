Dr. A. T. Shallenbergcr,
Rochester, Pa. Dear Sir: I
was agent for the sale of your An
tidote forMalaria at Elizabethtown,
Ky., when chills were almost uni
versal every season. The medi
cine cured when all else failed. It
was my habit to say that I could
live in a frog pond without danger
to myself, but that conceit has been
taken out of me, for last fall I had
a violent attack of chills. I re
membered the Antidote, procured
a bottle, and was cured immedi
ately. I now say to every one
suffering from Malaria, don't fool
with quinine; it may be good, but
Shnllenberger's is belter, and doVt
make you deaf, either.
Your friend, E. If, IIavcraft.
Liberty.
Time honored town, place of
pleasing and delightful memories,
cherished be thy name! Long hast
thou held a high place in the affec
tions of the people of the good old
cwmty of Amite, whose business
center for near a century has been
here. In this town the courts of
judicature have passed upon the
rights of persons and property of
four generations of men, who have
appeared upon the theatre of ac-
tisn and most of them passed away,
but have left behiud them others
who took their places in the drama.
The foot-lights are still burning,
the curtain is up, and the play
still goes on. When we consider
the many events that have trans
pired affecting the progress of busi
ness in this old settled town, and
contemplate the effect that despair
aging remarks from the drones of
each generation have had, as they
have traveled down the years to
the present time, we can but won
der that the town has bcon able to
live to see the afternoon of the
nineteenth century with vitality
enough to attract the attention of
business men, and to offer induce
ments to the artizan, the merchant
and the professional man who cast
their lot with her people Yet we
rejoice to see that the outlook is
brightening, and that in spite of
the restless and dissatisfied croak
ers, who can only find time to com
plain ot what others arc doing, that
business is improving, enterprise
is meeting with more encourage
ment and crowned with better suc
cess than has been the case for
many years. To men of business
and families of children to be edu
cated, we can offer good facilities
for the prosecution of their callings
and the education of their children.
A high school has been established
in the town, under the conduct of
an educated and experienced teach
er, who is the head of a family, and
expects to make this a permanent
home, and if he receives the pat-'
ronage he deserves, will in the
near future build up a college in
which the children and youth of
the country may be qualified for
the higher walks of life, and at the
same time have the benefit of
parental influence and home train
ing, thus shielding them from the
danger of contracting habits of dis
sipation, so common to students
while at colleges far away from
their homes. We are pleased to
learn that a number of families are
makingarrangements to avail them
selves of our business and educa
tional advantages, and expect to
move to our town soon, and we
would here suggest to parties who
own property abont town that is
now unoccupied and in a dilapidat
ed condition, to go to work at once
and improve their places, and
make them lcnantablc for families,
as there is now and will be still
more demand for houses suitable
for residences. There are several
saw mills around not far from
town, where lumber can be had at
reasonable prices, for making the
suggested improvements, and we
we do hope to see repairs on old
buildings, and new ones put up as
the incoming families may need
them. Ye habitual grumblers, for
get your complaints, and repair
your houses before they fall upon
your heads or got beyond repair;
and if vou will not repair vour
own houses, do not by your pic
tures of gloom prevent others with
more sunshine around them from
improving their property. Liberty
is and ever has been a safe place
for well conducted business, and
ever will be while the county seat
is here, and. owing to the central
position of our town in tho county,
that may be regarded as a perpep
uity. This, like all other towns,
is and will continue to be just
what the people make it. If every
one will do all that they can to
foster our school, encourage our
home business men, and persist in
this self-sustaining effort, we will
ere the ides of November next sec
a wide awake town, thronged with
a busy people, hear the sound of
the hammer in many directions,
and see the sign of the painters
brush all around, yards and gar
dens neatly fenced, and homes
again be emblematic of the refine
ment, prosperity and happiness of
our people.

Our Washington Letter.
Washington, Dec. 3, 1887.
The Democratic Congressional
Caucus, which will assemble at the
Capitol the last of this week, will
settle the fate of a number of as
piring gentlemen who are ambi
tious to serve their country as sub
ordinates of the House of Repre
sentatives. It is the opinion of
many that the Hon. Sunset Cox is
to be both temporary and perma
nent chairman of the Democratic
Caucus. Since I last wrote you,
the situation has changed somewhat
all the candidates for Doorkeeper
having withdrawn except two, Don
aldson and Hurt, a contestant for
the Clerkship having appeared in
the person of W. G. Raines, of
Rochester, N. Y.,and it is said that
he is supported by powerful influ
ences. On the other hand, the
friends of the present Clerk, Gen.
Jno. B. Clark, of Missouri, confi
dently claim his re-election.
Greater interest is felt in politi
cal circles in Washington as to what
may transpire at the other end of
the Capitol next Monday, as the
seats of at least two of the twenty-
six Senators who will present them
selves to be 6worn in on that day,
are to be contested one each from
California and West Virginia, lo say
nothing of a protest from Indiana
the situation being complicated
by the fact that of the fifty Sena
tors holding over, twenty-five are
Democrats and twenty-five are Re
publicans Riddlcberger included.
Thus the Senator from Virginia
holds the balance of power. I am
informed that it is the policy of the
Democrats to forestall the contests
by urging the seating of all the
new Senators at once in a body, and
in case the Republicans refuse as
sent to the proposition, to produce
a legislative dead-lock. The ad
mission of the Senators from Cal
ifornia and West Virginia involves
the right of the State legislature to
choose a United States Senator at
an extra session; thus the decision
in these cases will be useful as a
precedent to settle future contests
of this character.
There is every indication that the
Senate will wage a vigorous war
against the President this winter
the provocation being Mr. Clcav
land's appointment of the Ameri
can Fisheries Commissions, who
rank diplomatically as special en
voys, without the "advice and con
sent of the Senate." The question
of prerogative thus raised is quite
an old one, dating back early in the
history of the Government, and it
affords political demagogues a ready
subject of interminable contro
versy. The International Fisheries
commission is now in secret ses
sion at the State Department, and
consequently the deliberations of
this dignified body are not known
to the public.
The argument in the Standard
Oil discrimination cases, much to

Chief Justice Waite, of the Su
preme Court, celebrated his seventy-first
birthday this week, but he
does not look a day over sixty
years. One year ago the venerable
jurist was eligible to retirement,
and he could then have resigned
his commission and demanded a
salary of $10,000 per annum the
remainder of his life. The same
may be said of Associate Justices
Field, Miller, and Bradley. Per
haps in no other country of the
world can be witnessed four sep
tuagenarians vigorously working
every day, when they could re
ceive precisely the same compen
sation for doing nothing whatever.
According to the annual report of
the First Assistant Postmaster Gen
eral, the number of postoffices in
the United States on June 30, 1887,
was 55,157; it further shows the
still more gratifying fact that over
25,000 Democrats have been ap
pointed postmasters during the
past two years.
It is surprising to think of the
vast amount of money lost in trans
mission through the mails. The
report of the dead letter office
shows that the sum of $29,687 was
found in letters, of which amount
$22,639 was returned to the send
ers. There was deposited in the
Treasury $6,672, taken from dead
letters that could not be restored
to the owners, also. $2,921, the pro
ceeds of auction sales of packages
of merchandise, which could not
be restored.
The President's Message.
Times-Democrat: The message
gent yesterday by the President to
Congress is unique. It is, first of
all, the shortest Presidential mes
sage ever sent, and it is confined
wholly to a single subject the
tariff. The President declares that
the reports oi the various depart
ments will show their condition,
and, therefore, it is unnecessary for
him to recapitulate them again;
and he, therefore, devotes himself
to the consideration of the tariff as
the question of the most vital and
immediate importance. It is a
matter, he asserts, the considera
tion of which Congress cannot post
pone without great danger to all
our interests, without risk of a
financial crisis brought about by
tying up too much of the people's
money in the Federal Treasury.
It is something of a tribute to
this country, its great and increas
ing wealth, its natural resources,
and the economical administration
of its affairs, that the great ques
tion to be considered by the people
is how to reduce the revenue and
get rid of the surplus in the treasu
ry. It does not need, however, the
strong presentation made by Mr.
Cleveland to show us the evils
likely to follow from overtaxation
and from the rapidly accumulating
surplus. Some relief has hitherto
been obtained in the purchase of
bonds, but this is no longer possi
ble, save by paying extortionate
rates for the redemption of securi
ties that do not fall due for years
to come.
And now as to the President's
views on the tariff. They are put
strongly, emphatically and uneqiv-
ocally. The President declares
himself, in no uncertain terms, a
revenue reformer and opposed to
protection, pure and simple. He
would have Congress leave the in
ternal revenue alone, and concen
trate itself in the work of reducing
the tariff; he would have the free
list greatly enlarged, the duties cut
down principally on articles of ne
cessity. Mr. Cleavland argues
these questions and points out why
he recommends changes. The "in
dustrial," as the manufacturing
classes of the population are some
times called, constitute he says,
but a Bmall proportion of the work
ing population, yet all are taxed
and burdened to support them; the
duties prevent our competition
abroad with other countries, and
otherwise injure instead of benefit
ing the country.
It must be admitted that the
President presents these views
forcibly and strongly. It cannot
be doubted, after the manner in
which his views are pressed upon
Congress, that the tariffwill become
the chief matter of legislation this
winter, and that a tariff bill of
some kind or other will be passed.
It will rest with Congress to frame
one that will accomplish the great
est good to the country, with the
least injury to our industries. We
do not agree with the President
in regard to the non-reduction of
the tobacco tax. It is true that
tobacco is not a necessity, but the
tax is troublesome and burdensome
to the agricultural producer, and
the cost of its collection is consid
erable. In regard to the tariff du
ties, the President himself recom
mends, in accordance with the
plank of the Democratic platform
on this subject, that the reductions
be made so as to entail the least
injury to the laborers engaged in
our several factories, and to allow
the capitalists a fair share of profit,
at the same time that no encour
agement, aid or support be given
to "trusts" and monopolies.
Such a programme, if faithfully
carried out, would reduce the reve
nues with the leaBt injury to our
manufacturing industries. It is
possible, but in view of local, po
litical and other prejudices it is
difficult, and it will require great
statesmanship and wisdom to ac
complish this result.
Natural gas displaced in the year
1886 no less than 6,358,000 tons of
coal valued at $9,847,150, a fact
which goes far to explain the com
paratively small increase in pro
duction of coal contrasted with the
far greater increase in the produc
tion of iron.
In every community there are a
number of men whose whole time
is not occupied, such as teacher's,
ministers, farmers' sons, and
others. To these classes especial
ly we would Bay, if you wish fo
make several hundred dollars dur
ing the next few months, write at
once to B. F. Johnson & Co., of
Richmond., Va., and they will
show you how to do it.
It Will Not Fail.
THE MOST PERMANENT ASSOCIA
TION OF FARMERS EVER OR
GANIZED. NewMissisBippian: It is strange
that associations and unions of men
in all enterprises and professions
are maintained with prosperous
permanance, and no one predicts
their failure, and yet so many
loudly insist that the farmers can
never have a permanent association
and that the Farmers' Alliance
must soon suffer failure and de
molition. These statements are made with
out any foundation in reason, and
by men who are enemies of the
Alliance, when there is no just
cause for them to have any such
hostility.
The history of the Alliance,
which has now been in existence
for fifteen years, and during tha
time has strengthened and spread
with a continuous trend, proves
almost beyond a doubt that the
Alliance cannot fail.
This organization, which grew
out of the evident necessity for co
poeration among men of every
vocation, had an humble birth. It
came into the world with no sounds
of cymball or blare of bugle ; and
no speculator, no politician and no
idler helped to create it.
The farmers of Lampasas county,
Texas, saw that they could best
protect themselves and promote
their interests by co-operation, and
humbly and modestly enough, they
formed an Alliance, the principal
object of which was protection
against land and stock thieves.
The good effects of the Alliance
were obvious and indubitable, its
aims were extended. There were
many other things against which
they needed protection, and the
organization aided them in every
respect.
It spread into every county in
the State, with no failure or decay
in any single locality. It was in
troduced into other Stales, and in
each one its growth was just as
sure and steady as in the State of
its birth, and everywhere it has
helped as nothing else could have
helped to save the farmer from his
previous utter helplessness tion-
trol the prices of tho products of
his labor.
It has now been in operation in
Texas fifteen years, and it is scarce
ly possible to imagine an organiza
tion in a more prosperous condi
tion. It has 250,000 members in
that State, over 100 cotton ware
houses and 12 flouring mills, and
has about completed three cotton
factories.
It is not the enemy of the mer
chant, the manufacturer or the body
or brain laborer anywhere, or of
any legitimate business. It has
accomplished great good not only
for the farmers of Texas, but also
for the material interests of the
State.
And if there is anything in this
history of fifteen years to forbode
an early downfall of this greatest
of agricultural associations, ik is
not apparent to tho ordinary mind.
But one thing is sure, if this or
ganization cannot be maintained
and made a lasting success, there
is no hope of any other such or
ganization succeeding, and no hope
of the agricultural classes being
materially benefitted.
Where Sympathy is Needed.
Chicago Inter-Ocean: If there
were a better understanding of the
condition under which the very
poor live and a clearer definition
of the obstacles in the way of the
poverty-stricken who have the
spirit to escape from the environ
ment, and who are heart-sick with
seeking for the opportunity, there
would be less discontent and more
ambiton. A homeless man is very
apt to become a reckless man. A
man who can look forward to the
betterment of his condition is al
ways willing to bear a good deal to
attain his object; but, if there is no
promise of anything better, and if,
in spite of all his striving and an
honest endevor, circumstances grow
worse instead of beeter, he is likely
to become a worse citizen instead
of a better man. Those who have
been poor, and who are now in
good circumstances, can help those
who are now poor as much by an
attitude of sympathy and words of
encouragement as by contributions
in money. Neither the encourage
ment nor the money should be given
grudgingly.

A Lady'sKindly Tact.

that of a society leader who had

society ways and manners. Soon
after the dainty finger bowls were
placed on the table the rustic vis- 'Mm
itor took up her bowl and Urank
from it! Tho hostess observed it,
and showed admirable tact a mo
ment after by drinking from her
own bowl, thus sparing her guest
the mortification which might oth
erwise have resulted. Another
case where generous consideration
and tact were shown was where a
well known lady of Boston was
traveling in Europe not long since.
She went to London for only a day
or two for the solo purpose of see
ing a friend, who, by the way, be
longed to the nobility. When
strongly urged to meet a few friends
at the dinner next evening she de- J
clined, and on being pressed for a
good reason, was frank enough to
say that she had with her no suita
ble dress for such an occasion, but
only a black silk. "Wear your
black silk and I will wear one, loo, 1
so you may feel quite at ease," said
tho hostess, and a promise was giv
