it hampers the English than with the idea of accomplish

naval officers are anxious to have the American fleet get
in action. They believe more can be done by this means
than any other. England has been cautious about using
her fleet because any disaster to it would leave her
practically defenseless. America is not in the same con

THE PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE
The president's message to congress yesterday out
lines the wishes and objects of the American people to
ward the war plainly, yet fully; He puts in plain, words
what is the feeling of ninety-nine one-hundredths of the
American people and of the remainder he says: "But I
know that none of these speak for the nation. They do
not touch the heart of anything. They may safely be left
to strut their uneasy hour and be forgotten."
While bitterly arraigning German autocracy he points
out that we have no designs on German territory. That
we are ready for peace whenever the German people, not
German autocracy, are behind the terms of peace. There
is neither desire nor. intent to interfere with Germany's
affairs further than to remove the menace of militarism,
"and when the German people have agreed to accept the
common judgment of the nations as to what shall hence
forth be the basis of law and of the covenant tor the me
of the world we shall be willing to pay the full price for
peace and pay it ungrudgingly."
Answering his own question as to when we will con
sider the war won, the president says: "It will be only
when the German people through properly accredited
representatives, say they are ready to agree to a settle
, ment based upon justice and the reparation of wrongs
their rulers have done."
He points out that while the wrongs done by German
rulers must be righted, this must not be done by wrongs
on cur part. . -
Concerning 'Russia he deprecates the policy which
prevented the fullest statement.as to the aims of the war,
and expresses the belief, that had this been done the pres
ent troubles in Russia would have been avoided. As to
Austria-Hungary he asserts it is necessary to place her
with Germany as our enemy and at war with us. He
urges this because while her government poses as an ally
of Germany, it is in fact her tool. It is in no better shape
so far as its freedom is concerned than are the countries
which German armies have overrun. We war to save her
from Prussian autocracy just as we do to save other
smaller nations now under German domination.
While throughout the entire message, only a feeling of
sympathy for the German people who are misled by their
rulers is shown, and no bitterness expressed, it was uii
ferent when the president spoke of Americans who are
profiting by the war. "With these the law of supply and
demand" has given place to the law of unrestricted selfish
ness, he said. There is fine scorn in the depicting of this
class, and also a recommendation that drastic measures
be taken to curb the unholy traffic in the necessities of
life by these enemies of the country. Tie message will be
one that will live in history, for it is the statement plain
ly made of what America's objects are. It is a full state
ment of our case, of the groundson which we rely for the
judgment of the generations that shall come after us. It
is America's brief filed in the high court of the world, and
its arguments are unassailable and unanswerable.

HAS REACHED THE SUMMIT
We have been told successively that Germany was
starving, that she was weakening in man power, that she
was in danger from internal dissensions and that innum
erable other things were troubling her. Now press asso
ciation representatives tell us that she is at the summit
of her power and is at her strongest. Supposing this last
statement to be true, then we at least know that from this
on she will grow steadily weaker. This would make the
matter of victory only a question of time. If she is at her
strongest and cannot beat back the British and French on
the western front, and cannot complete her attempted
drive through Italy, then her worst has been done. Un
doubtedly she is making one last supreme effort to win
before America can make her strength felt This effort
would seem too late, for if necessary there are Americans
enough on the western front now to make a great showing
if calied upon. That Germany has given up hope of starv
ing either England or the French by her submarine war-
splendid account of itself, will have a fling at the enemy IUm Zt
before many months. Suddenly I remembered that Bob had

X up anv desired number of guests as I
had absolutely refused to" join them
again. Probably he had kept his word,
and that was the reason I had been
given no chance to cither accept or de
cline.
I took a cab from the station. My
return train left m just an hour, and
I must not miss it. When I arrived at
l.the Coster, I oxperionaad a momentary
feeling of embarrassment. It was not
not usual for a woman to go on the roof
unattended. Perhaps some objection
would be made, and I should have to
give it jip.
But I boldly entered the elevator with
several others, and uietly followed them
out. The man standing on the roof to
seo that no undesirable people found
their way up evidently supposed me
with them. They were uiet, inoffensive
looking people, , and would not be apt
to attract much attention tortunateiy
for me
I took a seat at a table, where, while
sereened myself, I could see perfectly.
I immediately ordered some sweets and
lemonade, and explained to the waiter
that I was waiting for a party. I would
tip Mm generously when I had accom
plished what I camo for. Ho had looked
disappointed until I told my little un
truth, when he had paid me all pos
sible attention.
I could see nothing of Mr. Boot," or
of Bob, But just as I was about to leavo
I had. concluded they had changed
their minds about coming to the Coster
there was a stir back of me, and Mr.
and Mrs. Koot, Henry Creedmorc, John
Kendall, Maud Warren, Marion Eiggs,
a woman I never had seen, and Bob were
seated at a table evidently reserved for
thom.
Bob was seated next the strange
woman. He was in gay spirits laughing,
gesticulating, talking in his excited
way. She was lovely, of an unusual type
and Bob had eves for no one but her.
There was no danger that I would be
discovered. I thought -bitterly, as I
watched the eagerness with which he
be,nt toward her, and the animation with
which they both conversed.
She was beautifully gowned in colors
that fairly glowed. A daring costume,
but immensely becoming to lior perfect
blondness. The wonderrul golden hair
was piled high and looked too heavy
for the snrJUl head to carry. Her eyes
were violet, her skin matchless. She
was petito, and her tiny beautifully
shaped hands emphasized all she said.
But none of these things hurt me as did
the fact that she was young younger
than Hob, who was almost twenty
eight. I should have judged her not
more than twenty had she not been
with those older than that. She I found
out long afterward was twenty-four.
I watched them until I dared wait no
longer, then quietly left my table and
the roof, scarcely hearing the voluble
thanKs or the waiter.
When I was in the cab, away from
curious eyes, I found tears of anger
filling my eves. I brushed hem aside.
I could not afford to cry; even mothers
had told m3 it made me look old. And
after the sight of that girlish loveli
ness I would not allow myself the lux
ury of tears which always disfigured
me.
I caught my ten o'clock train and
tried to read an evening paper I had
bought in the station to keep from cry
ing. Suddenly I heard a voice say:
"Well, if "this isn't fortunate!" and
Mrs. Baldwin came over and sat with

(United Press Btaff Correspondent)
Stockholm, Oct. 23. (By Mail) It
will be some weeks before this article
will be printed iu America. At that time
anything may bo happening in Kussia.
But I am willing to have this article
placed besido tho newest, hot from-Pet-rograd
cablegram no matter how bloody
and disturbing the news in it may be
and have these following words run
side by Ride with the description of the
latest Russian crisis:
Kus.sia is following the lines of all
revolutions and she is htirrvinic alonir
toward iromug out her difficulties.
eu and children in the streets, the ter
rifying of 3,000,000 citizens of the cap
ital of the largest country on earth, the
orgy of blood in which tho Kroustadt
sauors and the working men of Petro
grad indulged made it appear that lius'
siaus were madmen, lusting for blood.
There seemed no hope for Kussia if
sucli madness were to have sway.
But today, after having seen two
other great crisis, and looking back the
10 weeks to those bloody days, it is easy
to see that those, blood-lettings helped
Hussia along tho road toward liberty
and national unity.
There came the second crisis of the
Moscow conference, when We who sat
iu tho beautiful Moscow theatre that
sumiy August forenoon, expected, with
good reason, that a rine shot from the
troops outside the theatre or a shot or
a bomb in the theatre itself would
dye mighty Kussia iu. blood and set its
cities and towns aflame. Tho Moscow
conference ended on the edge of a cat
astrophe, and again we felt that Kus
sia 's case was hopeless. But today, look
ing back, and putting together into
one whole the red results of the Bol
sheviki revolution and the bitter end
ing of the Moscow conference', .Russia's
approach toward success is plainer than
over.
Then came tho Korniloff affair when
the world looked ou with flat lungs at
the Cossack "uproar" not knowing the !
reasons for the extraordinary event or
realizing that the Korniloff cause was
Early that morning Simon Simons,
honorary president of the Society of
EconomidhrSports, had a brilliant idea.
He had it while he was reading the ad
vertisements in the Morning Tweezers.
Hastily putting on his hat and cane,
he made his way to Prof. Notta Tali's
studio.
'Are you the man who guarantees to
teach mesmerism in one lesson for
$4.25" he asked.
"I am," replied Prof. Notta Tall, and
after collecting the $4.25, he showed
Simon Simons how to make the proper
passes, winks and cabalistic sounds.
"JNow, thought Simon Simons glee
fully when he found himself on the
street, again, " I have solved the high
cost of living question. I will simply
mesmerize the salesmen and make them
set any price for their wares that I
think suitable. I'll begin on this chest
nut vender and buy a pint of roasted
chestnuts for two cents."
And stepping in front of the vender
of chestnuts, he looked him in the eye
(ho only had one J, and made several
rapid passes with his hands. With a
wild yell, the vender leaped over his
pushcart and chased Simon Simons for
eleven city blocks and two country
miles. For he was" deaf and dumb and
knew onlv sign language, and Simon
Simons had happened to spell with his

to see this article alongside exciting
news from Kussia, the chances are that
the exciting news will have occurred a
few days before; or that it is due to
occur shortly, i'or crises fere going to
occur in Russia at an alarming rate. I
expect bloodshed in the streets of Rus
sian towns and cities. I expect anything
in the way of a human storm that im
agination can picture, but I stand pat
on the declaration that Kussia is being
rushed through the aeries of crises that
must come to auy country in a revolu
tion and that each crisis makes tho lius
sinn people saner and tho Kusisau re
public stronger.
Kerens- knows revolutions by heart;
as a physician might desirp to hasten
the various stages of a disease in order
that the euro" may be made the more
quickly, Kerensky has not avoided one
But all these crisis are connected and sPr?t yesterday's speech and the
only natural in any revolution. They
would happen in any country under sim
ilar circumstances and they are as much
to be expected, in a .revolution as a
wind in a storm.
I want to toll about them, in three
articles. They show how Russia is head
ing and speeding toward strength and
safety.
XOTE The next article wilt depict
tho Bolshcviki uprising in Petrograd
last July and describe how it was a
natural part of the good progress of
Russia toward freedom and strength.

The Daily News held up the pres

''It would be affectation to pretend

The Times still refused today to
agree with the president 's differentia

and the German people.
"President Wilson," the "Thunder

With a straight-forward statement of
