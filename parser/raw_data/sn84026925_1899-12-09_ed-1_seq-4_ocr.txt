A Mysterious Password.?The
Baroness BurdettCoutts was once
shopping in Paris and was passed from
one department to another by the {
shopmen, always with the remark,
"Two ten." She was escorted from ^
counter to counter, and everywhere ?
the cabalistic words "two ten" were j
repeated.
Struck by the peculiarity of this re- s
frain, the baroness asked the proprie- (
tor as she left t he establishment: "Pray t
what does 'two ten' mean? I noticed j
each assistant said it to the other {
wherever I went in your shop."
"Oh, it is nothing," he replied, s
"merely a password that they are in .
the habit of exchanging."
But the baroness was not satisfied
with this explanation. So in the even- (
ing, when the porter, a young boy, t
brought home her purchases, she said : ,
"My boy, would you like to earn 5
francs?"
Of course be bad oo objection.
"Tell me," said the lady, "what
does 'two ten' mean, and I will give
you 5 francs."
"Why, don't you know, ma'am?"
said he, evidently astounded at her
ignorance. "It means, 'Keep your
two eyes on her ten fingers.'"
The mystery was solved. The shopmen
of the Trois Quartiers had taken
the richest and the most generous
woman in Great Britain for a shoplifter.?Tit-Bits.
His Dream.?Papa (at the breakfast
table)?Willie, my boy, why are
you looking so thoughtful ? Are you
not well ?
Willie (very seriously)?Yes, papa;
but I bad a strange dream this morning.
Papa?Indeed ! What was it?
Willie?I dreamed, papa, that I died
and went to heaven; and when St.
Peter met me at the gate, instead of
showing me the way to the golden

gate, as i expecieu, u? wui mo
into a large field, and in the middle of 1
the field there was a ladder reaching
away up into the sky and out of sight. t
Then St. Peter told me that heaven \
was at the top, and that in order to J
get there I must take the big piece of .
chalk he gave me and slowly climb 1
the ladder, writing on each rung some 1
sin I had committed.
Papa?(laying down his newspa- 11
per.)?And did you finally reach heav- c
en, my son ?
Willie?No papa, for just as I was e
trying to think of soraetbink to write 1
on the second rung, I looked up into
the sky and saw you coming down. t
Papa?And what was I coming down i
for, pray ? I
Willie?That's just what I asked r
you, papa, and you told me you were X
going for more chalk.?Life. p
A Society Gradation?The lady T
residing in a 14-story flat was talking c
to the wife of the janitor. r
"Do you know Mrs. Higgins?" she 1
asked.
"Which Mrs. Higgins ?" inquired 8
Mrs. Janitor. c
"The one who comes her sometimes t
to help me with my sewing." r
"Ob," and her nose perked slightly. 8
"Her? I've met her; but I don't call 8
on her." t
"She's a nice woman isn't she?" t
"I never heard auythiog against her. ?
She isn't in my set, that's all." c
"Isn't her husband a janitor, just as I
yours is?" I
This time Mrs. Janitor was in quite
a dudgeon.
"Of course he's not," she exclaimed, ]
drawing herself up disdainfully, "ne is t
a janitor for a building that has only r
six stories, while none of our set would t
engage in a building of less than lOsto- t
ries, and this one, as you know, has s
14," and with a 14 story haughtiness c

They were covered with a pink gauze v
and looked very tempting indeed. y
The old lady bought the peaches s
and took them home. The next day c
she appeared again at the stall and 1
showed the stall keeper a small piece c
of pink veiling. c
"Do you keep that kind of veiling u
for sale?" she asked. p
The stall keeper told her that he
did not.
"Well," she said, "when I took p
those peaches home they were small c
and sour and green, and I thought if I e
could get some of that veiling that 8
made them look so pretty and plump p
in the basket I'd wear it myself. If it g

McKINLEY TO CONGRESS.
Comprehensive Summary of the President's
Annual Message.
Atlanta Journal, Tuesday.
The third annual message to congress
of President William McKinley,
submitted to that body today, is the
ongest document yet issued by the presdent.
The message will attract wideipread
attention because it deals with
he new conditions, brought about by
he accession of new territory resultng
from the Spanish-American war,
ind because it will be regarded as the
jlea of the Republican party for the
of tho Amfirio.an neoDle in the
lup^vi V V* VMV x 4
iresidential election of next year. Its
nain points are summarized below :
The president begins by stating that
>n the threshold of the deliberations
he members are called upon to mourn
vith their countrymen the death of
irice President Hobart, paying tribute
o the worth of the dead statesman.
RECOMMENDS GOLD STANDARD.
The president declares unqualifiedly
or the gold standard. On this monentous
question he says: "I urgenty
recommend that to support the exsting
gold standard and to maintain
the parity value of the coins of the
wo metals (gold and silver), and
he equal power of every dollar at
ill times in the market and in the
>ayment of debts,' the secretary of the
reasury be given additional power
ind charged with the duty to sell
Jnited States bonds and to employ
iuch other effective means as may be <
lecessary to these ends." . .
Mr. McKinley next discusses the ,
juestion of a merchant-marine, and
arnestly recommends that steps be
aken by congress to encourage and
lid in the establishment of a great ;
narine, seemingly endorsing the proposed
shin subsidv movement without j
aying so clearly.
HE URGES OPPOSITION TO TRUSTS. I
Perhaps there is no greater surprise in
he message than the president's refer- ]
snce to the trusts. He places his adninistration
squarely in opposition to 1
he combination of trade. On this sub- 1
ect he says:
"Combinations of capital organized 1
nto trusts to control the conditions of 1
rade among the citizens, to stifle com>etilion,
limit production and deteroine
the prices'of products used and
lonsumed by the people, are justly
irovoking public discussion and should
arly claim the attention of congiess."
NO ENTANGLING ALLIANCES" FOR US.
Coming to the Transvaal British war,
he president seemingly rebukes in no ,
mcertain tones the recent utterances of '
dr. Joseph Chamberlain, British cololial
secretary, and Mr. Joseph Choate,
Jnited States ambssador to England, [
iroclaiming that this country and
Snglaud are practically in alliance. 1
The president reaffirms the time-bon- J
ired doctrine that this country shall
emain free from entangling foreign al- '
iances. He says: 1
"This government has maintained 1
in attitude of neutrality in the uufortu- 1
late contest between Great Britain and
he Boer states of Africa. We have 1
emained faithful to the precept of 1
ivoiding entangling alliances as to
iffairsuotof our direct concern. Had !
:ircumstances suggested that the par- 1
ies to the quarrel would have welcom- 1
:d any kindly expression of the hope 1
>f the American people that war might '
>e averted, good offices would have 1
teeu tendered."
TALKS OF THE DESTINY OF CUBA. 1
Coming to the acquisition of Porto .
itico and discussing the Cuban quesion,
the presideut dwells ou the desti- J
ly of both countries, recommending
he establishment 01 a civn govemnent
for Porto Rico as rapidly as pos- '
ible and the raising of the customs
luties on exports of that island. He (
leclares that the island of Cuba,
vhicb is temporarily under the pro- '
ection of the United States, must be
urned over to the people of the island
is soon as a stable government can be
brmed, reaffirming the purpose of the
[overnment declared prior to the
Spanish war that the people of Cuha 1
vould be given their freedom and the J
roke of Spanish rule swept away. He |
ays this pledge is of the highest hou rable
obligation and must be sacred- (
y kept. Then he speaks of the intima- j
y which must exist between Amen- ,
a and Cuba and the destiny of the (
3lauds, declaring we must protect the
>eople.
THE PHILIPPINES ARE OUR8.
The president relegated the Philiptine
question away to the rear of his
essage ; but it can be clearly discern- ,
d that he intends what he says on the
ubject to be regarded as the most im- j
>ortant part of the document. He be- ]
;ins on the question by referring to the
reaty of peace between Spain and the ,
Jnited States signed December 10th, ,
898, by which Spain ceded to this
country the Philippine islands in con- (
ideration of $20,000,000 and peace. ,
ie declares on this question :
"The islands were ceded by the govrument
of Spain, which had been in
mdisputed possession of them for cenuries.
"They were accepted not merely by
>ur authorized agents in Paris under
lirection of the executive ; but by the
lonstitutional and well cousidered aciou
of the representatives of the peo>le
in both houses of congress. I had
very reason to believe and still beieve
that this transfer of sovereignty \
vas in accordance with the wishes ,
ind aspirations of the great mass of ,
be Filipino people.
"On the 21st of December, after the ,
reaty was signed, the commander of j
he forces of occupation was Instruc- |
ed 'to announce and proclaim in the
nost public manner that we came, not |
is invaders and conquerers; but as |
rieuds, to protect the natives in their
lomes, in their employments and in |
heir personal and religious rights.' "
A SHOT FOR AGUINALDO. j
"It is enough to say that the claim <
of the rebel leader that he was promised
independence by any officer of the
United States in return for his assistance
has no foundation in fact and is
categorically denied by the very witnesses
who were called to prove it.
The most the insurgeut leaders hoped
for when he came to Manila was the
liberation of the islands from the Spanish
control, which they had been laboring
for years without success to
throw off.
"The prompt accomplishment of this
work by the American army and navy
gave him other ideas and ambitions,
and insidious suggestions from various
nn?jorioH thp mimosa And
^uai itio pvi 7 v? vw? - ? ? ? j?
intentions with which he had taken up
arms.
"The future government of the
Philippines rests with the congress of
the United States. If we accept them
in a spirit worthy of our race and our
traditions, a great opportunity comes
with them. The islands lie under
the shelter of our flag. They are
ours by every title of law and equity.
They cannot be abandoned. If we desert
them, we leave them at once to
anarchy and finally to barbarism. We
fling them, a golden apple of discord,
among the rival powers, no one of
which could permit another to seize
them unquestioned. <
"Their rich plains and valleys would
he the scene of endless strife and
bloodshed. The advent of Dewey's 1
fleet in Manila bay, instead of being, '
as we hope, the dawn of a new day of i
freedom and progress, will have been
the beginning of an era of misery and I
violence worse than any which has i
darkened their unhappy past. The i
suggestion has beeu made that we i
could renounce our authority over the i
islands, and giving them independence,' I
could retain a protectorate over them. I
This proposition will not be found, I !
am sure, worthy of your serious atten- <
tention. Such an arrangement would I
involve at the outset a cruel breach of
faith. It would place the peaceful and i
- ?L. ?I. ,
loyal majority, wuu ua?v iui uuumuK (
better than to accept our authority, at
the mercy of the minority armed |
insurgents. It would make us respon- i
sible for the acts of the insurgent lead- ,
ers and give us no power to coutrol (
them. It would charge us with the <
task of protecting them against each ;
other and defending them against any
foreign power with which they chose
to quarrel. In short, it would take |
from the congress of the United States ,
the power of declaring war and vest 1
that tremendous prerogative iu the ]
Tagalo leader of the hour.

LANCASTER?Ledger, December 1
6: Saturday morning last, Ed Bal- <
lard and Minor Billings, two colored t
boys, were fooling with a pistol at one i
of the restaurants on the back street, <
when it was discharged while iu the i
hands of Ballard, the ball going into i
Minor's left shoulder. The wound <
was not serious. Rev. J. E. Car- 1
lisle left Monday for Orangeburg to f
attend the annual conference of the 1
M. E. church South. He is the guest t
of F. S. Dibble. Major J. M. Riddle I
left yesterday. He is the guest of ?
Julius Ahreus. Rev. G. C. Leonard is ?
stopping with D. VV. Ayers during his t
3tay at the conference. Miss Lily 1
Russell, of Richburg, who has been ?
engaged to teach the Carmel Hill ?
school, came over Monday and will ?
open the school at once. Our t
community was pained to learn of the i
death of Mr. John J. Graham, which I
occurred in Chester last Saturday night, 1
of pneumonia. Mr. Graham was born f
here and spent the greater part of his ?
life here in the employ of different ?
mercantile establishment as clerk or ?
bookkeeper. He was faithful in every J
' j ,
position ne ever uuuupicu ?uu uui- versally
respected. He was about 60 '
years of age, and leaves his wife and '
one son surviving him. He served as J
a Confederate soldier, and in the army, ?
as everywhere else, he did his duty (
fearlessly and bravely. He was a t
member of the Methodist church and '
in his younger days was one of its 1
highest officials. Since his return from f
Alabama, about six years ago, where f
he spent several years, his health has
been very poor. (
CHESTER?The Lantern, Decern- t
her 5 : Mr. Wm. Byrd says the Charley '
Bird, reported as captured and escaping ?
in the Philippines, was named as oue \
of the Yorktown's crew, captured in c
April, and, of course, is not his son.
Mr. A. A. Owens left Sunday for
Tennessee, where he will spend some
time visiting bis brother and other
friends. He will visit Arkansas also
while he is gone. Mr. Owens has been
looking forward to this trip for years ;
but was waiting till he had some one
to leave in charge of his affairs. Now
be has a son taller than himself, and he
can go off and feel easy. We told
about Hugh Boyd's terrpin farm not
long ago, but there are others. Joe
Curry is also in the industry. He
fouud oue of these armored reptiles a
few days ago bearing the inscription
"J. B. 1867." The initials are supposed
to be those of the late Mr. (Big) John
Rni 't Tr. wm still on his Dlautation
and seemed content to stay. Mr. Curry
renewed the date and set it outside
of the clearing. Mr. Curry himself
dated one in 1876, and again in 1880
and 1898. In the 22 years it had not
traveled 50 yards from where it was
first found. Last night about midnight,
a passenger coach attached io a
northbound freight train, was sidetracked
and left here in care of the sheriff
and police. It was full of Negro railroad
hands returning from work on a
new railroad below Columbia. Among
them was the dead body of Isaiah Scott,
of Rock Hill, with a pistol ball through
his heart; and also John Woodward,
the slayer, whose home was on Mr. S.
T. McKeown's place, in this county.
There seems to be little if any dispute
about bow the shooting happened.
The Negroes were generally drunk,and
between Winusboro and White Oak
3ome dispute arose. Woodward came
up and asked what the fuss was about,
and about the same time drew his pistol
and fired. The whole crowd was
locked in the coach, which was brought
here and cut off, as stated above.
Sheriff Cornwell went through the
crowd and captured four pistols, but
the Negroes say that dozens of them
were thrown out of the windows along
Ihe road. Coroner Shannon is holding
an inquest at this writing.

Dollar Wool In Boston.?Suppose
a large uumber of our people had

two ago, would they not have a picnic

Boston Commercial Bulletin is interesting
:
The London public sales confirmed
the level reached at private sales, with
an advance of 16 per cent, since the
last auctions. Dollar wool has come
in Boston for the first time siuce 1884.
A line of Tasmanian sold this week at
$1 the scoured pound. The scarcity
of merino wool all over the world is
sending Canadian users of South African
wools to this market for California,
and anything cheap in the shape of
hurry and defective finds a ready purchaser
in the exporter. Some short
Oregon goes abroad this week at a
9coured cost of 60c. The heavy stocks
left here from the glut of 1897 have
prevented the market rising relatively
as high as foreign markets; but the

THIS is the season during which the
people of this section generally make
selection of the newspaper they expect to
read during the following year.
We want THE ENQUIRER to go as a
TWICE-A-WEEK visitor to every home
in York county. With the assistance of
intelligent and trustworthy friends in the
different localities, we know it can be
gotten into many homes to which it is not
now going. This assistance is of much
value to us, and it is our purpose to pay
for it most liberally, in proportion to the
service rendered.
The propositions we make herein are
to all responsible individuals, in each and
every locality. There is no monopoly in
the matter. Because an individual returned
the name of a certain subscriber
last year, is no reason why he should
have any claim upon that subscriber this
year. Because one individual may already
be at work in a given neighborhood,
is no reason why another should
not also canvass in that neighborhood.
Every clubmaker is entitled to get subscribers
whenever and wherever he or
Hlie may ue auie to get mmn, ? >< up....
compliance with the conditions herein
stated, have thein counted.
Our plan of compensation to clubmakers
this year is on the same line as heretofore?a
competition for TWO LEADING
PREMIUMS to be awarded for the
TWO LARGEST clubs, and a third leading
premium for the largest club of
NEW SUBSCRIBERS. After that the
value of the premium is in proportion to
the number of names returned.
The Leading Premiums.
For the LARGEST club of subscribers
RETURNED and PAID FOR, at$1.75, we
otter the choice between the following premiums:
A BEST GRADE "ROCK
HILL BUGGY", with quarter-leather
top, valued at $75; a BEST GRADE
"YORKVILLE BUGGY," with quarterleather
top, valued at $60; a handsome
SUIT OF FURNITURE valued at $50.
For the NEXT LARGEST CLUB,
we will give the choice between the above
articles left after first choice.
For the LARGEST CLUB OF NEW
SUBSCRIBERS we will give the premium
which is left after the first and second
choice has been made.
The handsome suit of furniture may
be seen at the store of W. B MOORE
ifc CO., and the buggies in the warerooms
of the respective manufacturers in Yorkville
and Rock Hill.
In addition to the competitive premiums
mentioned above, we also offer various other
premiums for clubs containing specified numbers
of numes, and propose to deliver the premiums
whenever tne numbers specified are
returned and paid for. Upon securing one
premium?a watch or sewing machine, say?
the clubniaker will be at liberty to try for the
tame thing again, or for anything else on the
list, and it in the aggregate, by the 7TH DAY
DF MARCH, 1900, he shall have succeeded in
returning and paying for the largest number

with Jjrlght, fresh^news from
THE COUNTY, STATU, inaiiuii aiiu
WORLD, Interesting stories, Instructive miscellaneous
matters, and humorous selections,
explanatory editorials, etc. The paper will be
held up to Its present nigh standard, and will
continue prompt, explicit, reliable, and, In
short, the best.
TO EACH NEW SUBSCRIBER,
The same as above except that If the paper
is COMMENCED NOW, IT WILL BE SENT
UNTIL JANUARY 1, 1001, without any
charge for that portion of the time between
now and January 1, 11(00. It is understood,
however, that for a new subscriber to get the
benefit of this offer, he must pay the clubmaker
$1.75 at the time the name Is entered upon
our books. If the$1.75 Is not paid at tblstlme,
then the subscription will only date one year
from the time it is entered.
By new subscribers, we mean those whose
names were not on OUR BOOKS ON SEPTEMBER
13, 1899, except we will not count as
new subscribers, cases where the subscription
may have been changed from the name of one
member of a family to another. This is Intended
emphatically to mean new additions
to our subscription list.
TWO SIX MONTHS SUBSCRIBERS at $1
each, will be considered the equivalent of one
yearly subscriber at $1.75 and so counted. A
subscription paid for two or more years in advance
at $1.75, will be counted as one name for
each year so paid.
Clubmakers will be held personally responsible
for the payment of all names returned by
them. After a clubmaker has returned and
paid for any name, he can. at anytime thereafter,
discontinue the sending of the paper to
the person for whom he has paid, and transfer
the unexpired time to any other person, provided
the person to whom the transfer is
desired was not a subscriber at the time the
original name was entered on our books.
No name will be counted In competition for
a premium until the subscription price has
been paid; nor will any premium be delivered
until a satisfactory settlement has been made
for all names returned by the clubmaker.
Persons who commence making clubs will
not be permitted to transfer their club to another
clubmaker's list after the names have
oeen euiereu uii uui uvu^o.
It is not necessary that the names on a club
should all be at the same postofflce. Names
may be taken at any number of places.
Clubmakers are requested to send In names
a.- rapidly as they secure them after November
4th, 1899.
All subscriptions must be forwarded to us at
the expense of those sending them.
We will be responsible for the safe transmission
of money only when sent by draft, registered
letter or money order drawn on the
Yorkvllle postofflce.
In sending names, write plainly, and give
postofflce, county and state.
All subscriptions will be discontinued at the
expiration or the time paid tor.
A separate list will be kept for each clubmaker,
who will be credited with each name
sent, so that the number sent by any one per- *
son may be ascertained at a moment's notice.
In case of a tie for either premium, two
weeks will be allowed In which to "untie."
The time In which names may be returned
under our propositions will commence now,
4ili day of November, 1809, and expire at 4
o'clock p. in., on Wednesday, the 7th day
of March, 1000.
