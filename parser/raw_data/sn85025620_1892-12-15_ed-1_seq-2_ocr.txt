prosecutions were terminated. The at­
torney general says that the increase
in the number. of southern war claims
(now aggregating $400,000,000) is a sub­
ject that demands the immediate at­
tention of congress. The number of

eight 6-inch and thirty-four 4-inch guns, all of
which have been or are to .be manufactured

vessels will have been launched, thirteen of
them, including the three tugs, .durlnjr the cur­
rent year, and of all the new ships the con­
struction of which has been begun during the
present administration only two will remain on
the stocks on the 4th of March-next
"Our new navy, including all vessels built or
authorized, now consists-of the following ves­
sels: One sea-going battleship (first class
Iowa. Three coast-line battleships (flrst-clsSs)
—Massachusetts, Indiana, Oregon. Two battle­
ships (second class)—Maine, Texas. Six
double-turreted harbor-defense vessels—Puri­
tan. Monterey. Mlantonomoh, Monadnock, Ter­
ror, Amphitrite. Two armored cruisers—New
York, Brooklyn. Oae ram'. Two protected cruis
ers of extreme speed—Columbia, Minneapolis.
Fourteen cruisers—Olympia, Baltimorei, Chi­
cago, Philadelphia, San Francisco, Charleston,
Newark, Boston, Atlanta, Cincinnati, Raleigh,
Detroit, Montgomery, Marblehead. One dis­
patch vessel—Dolphin Six gunboats—York
town, Concord, Bennington, Macbiag, Castine,
Petrel. One dynamite vessel—Vesuvius. One
practice vessel—Bancroft Two torpedo boats
—Cushing, No. 2, making a total of forty-two
vessels.
the above, with perhaps one or two ex­
ceptions, are essential components of a
fully developed naval force, but the rel­
ative contribution to the defensive power
of the United States to be found in
these groups of vessels Is not to be
measured either by the number, of ships
or the number of tons alone. The develop­
ment of the last four years' has not been con­
fined to ships alone. At the beginning of this
administration the naval establishment was
entirely destitute of certain elements of effi­
ciency, each one of which was indispensable
to Its practical employment as a fighting force,
and the absence of which, if it had' been pos­
sessed of a hundred ships, would still have left
it in a condition of paralysis. These were the
following Armor, torpedoes, heavy rapid-fire
guns, armor-piercing shells, smokeless powder,
high explosives.
The secretary details at length noteworthy
progress in the production of these things, and
says the progress noted, by which the United
States has emerged from its condition of help­
lessness at sea and by the employment of its
own resources has distanced its most experi­
enced competitors, marks an epoch in naval de­
velopment not only of this country but of the
world.
Coming'down to a detailed statement .as to
armor tests the secretary tells of the work ac­
complished, of the tremendous test to which
the Harvey nickel-steel armor plate was sub­
jected, as the result of which improved meth­
ods were introduced in the Harvey process, and
continues:
"Tne result has never been equaled or even
approached, before by any armor plate, Amer­
ican or foreign. It has demonstrated that
the United States, in the reconstruction of
its new navy, which ten years ago had no
existence even on paper, ieu enabled to
place upon each and all of its armored
vessels a material the like of which the
world, up to this time, has not seen and that
while vast sums have been spent in plating the
sides of foreign men-of-war with an inferior ma­
terial, this country will employ for the purpose
an armor which is not only far more efficient
but which represents unquestionably, having
reference to the dimensions of plates thus far
tested, the highest development of modern
science, and a development reached by its own
independent efforts.
"Following the example of tbe United States,
the English government four weeks ago held a
trial of the new American armor, and it is
clear
from the highly successful results of the trial
that the United States, instead of being the last
in the race in tbe construction of vessels of war
or of borrowing its best ideas from abroad, has
set an example in this respect which other
maritime powers will speedily follow."
In reference to ordnance of the navy the
secretary makes extended reference to develop­
ments promising greatly improved results.
Comment is also made at length as to powder
manufacture, high explosives and projectiles,
all showing progress of the most satisfactory
nature. With regard to torpedoes, while ihe
Howell torpedo has not gone much beyond the
stage of hope with which the department en­
tered upon a contract for its manufacture four
years ago, yet the latest trials are giving great
promise.
The secretary speaks with much satisfaction
of the act to "encourage American ship build­
ing." under which the City of Paris and City
of New York are admitted to American reg­
istry.
The aggressive policy oC foreign nations con­
tinues, and-this count.**- whether it will or
fiot,
will soon be forced into a position where
cannot disregard measures which form a
standing menace to its prosperity and security.
On the isthmus^our commerce is engaged in a
desperate fight to maintain its foothold. In
the south Pacific repeated annexations and
protectorates are extending the power and in­
fluence of the maritime states of the old
world. Subsidized lines of fast steamers are
completing the circle of maritime communi­
cation on tbe eastern and western coasts of
the Dominion of Canada and fortresses daily
increasing in strength are surrounding our
coast upon the south and east Under these
circumstances it is imperative to the welfare of
this country that the policy of naval recon­
struction, successfully carried on in the
past, should suffer no interruption in the
future.
Much space is devoted to interesting details
as to the operations of ships in commission the

Otter Praia,
''''•''iffASBrtOTOK, Decf li.—The Decem­
ber statistical returip .to the deparV
inept e^' agriculture related to fanfc
prices. The average Value of corn is
80.8 bents per^ ,bushel, depressed by
the surplus- of the previous
erop and early distribution.
It.... is 80 to 70 cents, in the east­
ern states, 50 to 80 cents in the middle
States, ranging from 49 to 85 in the cot­
ton states, 42 .in Ohio, 40 In Indiana* 87
in Illinois, 88 in Missouri, 82 in Iowa,
81 in Kansas and 38 in Nebraska. This
ia higher in Nebraska than for any
year since 1882 except in 1887 and 1890,
and fat Iowa in the same time the pres­
ent average 'value has been exceeded
only in the two years named.
The average price of wheat is 63.2
cents. The next lowest price was 84.5
cents in 1884. In 1888 1887 and 1890
the average was a cent or two below 70.
Last year it was 889. Principal state
prices are: New York, 85 Pennsyl­
vania, 81 Virginia, 76 Georgia, 90
Texas, 75 Kentucky, 67 Ohio, 68
Michigan, 69 Indiana, 64 Illinois,.
64 Minnesota, 61 Iowa, 60 Missouri,

nia, 70.
The average value of oats is 81.6
cents, nearly the same as last year.
Rye, 54.8 cents. Barley, 4K cents.
Buckwheat, 5a 4 cents. Potatoes, 67.8
cents .per bushel, against 37.1 cents
lastyear. Hay,
$8.49
per ton, nearly
the same as in1891.
The condition of winter wheat the
first day of December averaged 87.4,
against 85.
8 last year. In the Ohio val­
ley the range is from 79 to 87, and is
low also in Kansas and Pennsylvania.
It is high in New York, in the south
and on the Pacific coast. In the
southern states and on the Atlantic
coast germination was delayed by
drought, and the same cause delayed
both planting and growth in the Ohio
valley, and materially reduced condi­
tion of the crop. The condition of
winter rye is but little better, aver­
aging^^
A REIGN OF TERROR.
Blood Flown Freely In the Elkborn Min­
ing Region la West Virginia—The Har.
derer of an Officer Lynched.
WHEELING,-W. Va., Dec. 12.—Blood
has been flowing down in the Elkhorn
mining region the last few days. As
the record now stands two men have
been murdered, one lynched and a
faithful officer of the law lies mortally
wounded. The first victim of the mur­
derers was Officer James Brooks, who
was killed at Keystone, on the
Elkhorn river, in an attempt to sup­
press disorder growing out of the too
free indulgence by the miners in liquor
on pay day.
Officer Dillon and Constable Burton
attempted to regulate a tough colored
man named Cornelius Coffee, when Cof­
fee opened fire on them. Dillon was
shot through the right breast, near the
nipple, and died. Burton received a
ball in the body but is expected to pull
through. This shooting, followed
so closely on the murder of
Officer James Brooks, stirred up
great excitement and a close search
was made for Coffee, who succeeded,
however, in boarding a Chesapeake &
Ohio train and was soon over the line
into Virginia. Conductor Griffith rec­
ognized Coffee on the train and tele­
graphed ahead to the officers at Poca
hontas, who arrested him on the ar­
rival of the train.
The West Virginia authorities were
notified and Detective Eugene Robin­
son went to Pocahontas, secured his
man and started back to Elkhorn.
When Keystone,' the scene ol
the tragedy, was reached a mob
of determined men entered the
train, quietly relieved Robinson oi
his man, proceeded to a tree close b,y
the track, and Coffee was' dangling
from a limb in a few minutes, while
the mob riddled his body with a hun­
dred bullets and then dispersed, leav
ing the corpse hanging at the end of a
rope.

the
Body.
While we drive
the brain we
must build up
the body. Ex­
ercise, pure air
—foods that
make healthy flesh—refreshing
sleep—such are methods. When
loss of flesh, strength and nerve
become apparent your physician
.will doubtless tell you that the
quickest builder of all three is
Scott's EmulsioB
of Cod Liver Oil, which not only
creates flesh of and in itself, but
stimulates the appetite for other
foods.

"German
Syrup
99
JUDGE J. B. HILL, of the Superior
Court, Walker county, Georgia,
thinks enough of German Syrup to
send us voluntarily a strong letter
endorsing it. When men of rank
and education thus use and recom­
mend an article, what they say iis
tvorth the attention of the public.
It is above suspicion. I have used
your German Syrup," he says, "for
my Coughs and Colds on the Throat
and Lungs. I can recommend it for
them as a first-class medicine."—
Take no substitute.
YOUR HEALTH.
The citadel of life must be guarded
it two points. In the first place there
is the danger of taking cold. We take
cold through the skin and this affects
the kidneys and the lungs. So. inti­
mately are these organs connected,
that a cold affects both. In order to
relieve the system, both should be
treated, or rather the whole system
should be regulated. This is done by
Reid's German Cough and Kidney
Cure. It acts as a stimulant and re­
stores the organs to action. The
other weak spot is the digestion.
When the food does not digest, it ac­
cumulates and causes fever, sickness
and death. The Laxative Gum Drops
will remove all waste material from
the system and do it without pain or
griping. Ask your druggist for these
remedies and see that he gives them
to you.
