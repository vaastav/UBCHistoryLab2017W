MRS. WALTER GAINS
Twenty Pounds in Weight After
Taking Tanlac. .
As Well and Strong -Now As
Ever in Her Life.
"By the help of Tanlac I am rid of
a case of stomach trouble -that made
life miserable for five years, and I
have pained twenty pounds in weight."
said Mrs. XI. Walter, who resides at
203 West Mulberry St.. Bloomington,
111. Continuinp. she said:
-"I had an extremely poor appetite
and would have to force down what
this would cause me intense misery. I
would Moat something awrul ana my
heart would palpitate so badly itwould
frichtn me. and I also had creat dif
ficulty in breathing at times. I would
also have such cramping pains in my
stomach I could hardly stand them.- I
was troubled a preat deal with my
kidneys and I would just almost
scream with pain that -wouldstart in
the small of my back and seem to
work up under my shoulder blades. I
could get but little sleep as I could lie
in no position in which I would not be
in misery. Loss of sleep and pain and
lack of nourishment soon caused me
to lose weight until f was scarcely
more than a frame and I was so weak
I could do hardly any of my house
work. T would also have terrible
splitting headaches and would become i
so dizzy at times I would have to catch
hold of something or sit down to keep
fr,n. folllno- M7oll T loot (IraffCPl Ollt
year after year in this terrible condi
tion without being able to find any
thing to help me, altho I had tried
every kind of treatment and medicine
I could hear of, and had become very
much discouraged, when one day 1
met a friend of mine I had not seen
before In six months and who the last
time I saw her was in an awful bad
condition and suffering terribly, but
who now was a perfect picture of
health and looked at least twenty
years younger. ' She declared she was
well and that she owed it all to Tan
lac. and advised me to try it.
"I took her advice and began taking
Tanlac. and I want to say right here
it is the grandest medicine on earth In
my opinion. I soon had a fine appe
tite and could eat anything I wanted
without suffering any bad after ef
fects, and I was never troubled with
j;as or palpitation of the heart. I con
itmvd taking it until I am a healthy
woman again. My kidneys never
bother me at nil and the pains in my
1-ack have entirely left me, and I have
iot had the headache or those dizzy
-pells since I started taking Tanlac.
1 am as strong as I ever was in my life
and can do all my housework with the
greatest ease. If I could get Tanlac
1 wouldn't care whether there was any
other medicine in the world, for I
l uve such faith in i I don't believe I
vould ever need anything else." ' n

laws to promote the safety of passen- V
gers and employes was charged to the
railroads of the United States today!
J by W. P. Borland, chief of the bureau
of safety of the I. J. C in his annual
report. In the case of the hours of ;
service laws, which prohibits train s
operatives from remaining on duty!
more than sixteen hours except in ex- r
traordinary circumstances, Mr. Bor-
land's report declared managing: offi
cers apparently had Riven their sanc
tion to evasions "to such an extent as
to defeat the purposes of the iw."
He charged that safety had been sac
rificed to expediency.
Railroad companies were said to
have paid "comparatively little atten
tion to the maximum requirement of
the law regarding, safety appliances."
They were said to have contented
themselves with meeting the mim
mum, which orders that 85 per cent
of the cars in any trains shall be equip
ped with 'power brakes, disregarding
the maximum requirement that all
cars so equipped muBt be connected
and the brakes in operation. Hand
brakes also were alleged still to be in
use on some railroads for controlling
trains on mountain grades, altho the
law specifies that trains must be con
trolled by power brakes.
n some roads employing th "man
ual block signal system, jt was said
dangerous practices are followed and
rules violated to such an extent as to
render the block signal system entire
ly useless.
Log trains which are exempted
from safety appliance regulations are
being operated over main lines in
Georgia and Florida without any
brakes except on engines andt ca
booses. DIVIDENDS FOR XMAS

ASK HAYS TO CITY
Republicans Plan To Invite
- Chairman To Banquet.
Address Will Officially Open
Campaign in Kansas.
Will H. Hays, chairman of the Re
publican national committee, may be
the guest of honor of Kansas Repub
licans at their annual dinner in To
peka January 29. Plans to brinff Hays
to xopeica were being discussed this
afternoon at a meeting of the execu
tive committee of the Kansas Day
clu.b.
Official openinc of the 1920 cam
paign in this state is expected to occur
when Kansas Republicans hold-their
annual love feast here next month. It
is the plan of officers of the banquet
club to start the campaign, with a top
line attraction who would displav fa-
voritism toward none of the probable
presidential candidates. Recently Re-
publican leaders have urged speeches i came WpntIfiod wUh the aocial life orf To

Lowden of Illinois and other possibili-
ties before the Republican national!
convention. Kansas, tho. would bet
ter maintain her present neutrality to
the field by a speech from Chairman
Hays. In view of this fact officers of
the club are expected to invite Hays to
attend the banquet. -
rive Kansas speakers will probably
be given places on the program next
month. At least one of these speakers
will be a woman. Should Chairman
Hays be able to come to Kansas, he
will be the guest of honor of the Re
publican dinner club and will be allot-
ed such, time as desired for his dis
cussion of national issues.

surrendering the roads or announces
chance in his plans. Some admln!s-
tration officials believe the fat of the
railroad legislation in congress will b
a determining factor in whatever i
done. Many offieials think it will be
disastrous industrially to suirendet
the roads without adequate .gislation
to meet their changed status.
Meantime, however, preparations
are going forward at the railroad ad
ministration for turning the roads
back In accordance with the decision
announced by President Wilson in his
message to congress last May.
Surrender of the roads would make
very little difference In actual opera

lines now are being operated by their
