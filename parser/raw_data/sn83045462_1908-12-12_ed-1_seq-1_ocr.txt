SCARE AJjAYY YARD I
Railroad Company Gives 1
* Notice of Removing Tracks.
DANGER OF BIG DISCHARGE 1
Work for 2,000 Men Contingent I
Upon New Tracks.
ADMIRAL LEUTZE POSTS ORDER I
Bill Prepared Urging Congress to ?
Build New Tracks Refused by
Railroad Company.
Disaster is threatened to the Washington
navy yard far greater than the much- p;
talked-of discharge of 200 workmen, ac- F
cording to officials of the yard. al
The Philadelphia, Baltimore and Wash- w
ington Railroad Company has announced B
its intention to remove its tracks now con. S]
necting with the naval gun factory at M N
street southeast because of the failure M
of Congress to take actionem the pending
matter.
The removal of the tracks, naval ottl- m
cials declare, will necessitate the navy w
yard authorities resorting to the means tt
of transportation of a past century?ox v<
teams and mules?and will result in a pos- ai
sible reduction^ in the force of mechanics
and helpers of *2,000 men. **
"As a result of these disclosures today t'
the employes of the great gun-making st
plant of the government are much
wrought up. Rear Admiral Eugene H. ^
C. Leutze, commandant of the navy yard, '
calls attention briefly but pointedly in tr
an order that was posted in the several lis
shops and offices at the yard today to the hi
menace caused by the threatened cut-off tj.
of railroad connection with the establish- ,
ment. ?
Admiral Leutze's Order. rt
The order follows: pi
"In view of the fact that certain addl- L
tional work has been allotted to this yard, p<
the notice in regard to discharge of about es
300 men on the 1st of January, 1900, pub- ci
lished November 21, 1908, is hereby modi- fc
fled. A* for as now can be foreseen the
present force of employes can be retained
until about April 1, 1909, unless the rail
road connection with the yard Is cut off." h.
"As the sutn of about Jt2.000 per day Is a!
paid in salaries to the employes of the
Washington navy yard in cold cash and
not in promissory notes," a naval officer 18
said today, "and the money Is spent In n<
the District for rent, food and other ne- ai
cessities. the menace to the gun factory 0j
becomes a matter of moment to the busl- m
ness men ef Washington, and they should
assist In providing a check to the threatened
wholesale discharge." or
Congress, by its acts e t 1501 and 1003, *'
required the removal of the present railrqu|
track connection by a date not V1
later than April 38, 1908. By act of May <*c
2T, |908, Congress authorised and direct- jf
edSMg Philadelphia, Baltimore and Wash- J1'
ingten Railroad Company to construct at *?
its expense a single branch track or sidlog
ftom- its present main line at a point "}
in the vicinity of the Pennsylvania ave- c1'
nuo bridge over the Eastern branch of the su
Potomac, along a prescribed-route to a ai
connection -with the track system of the
navy yard. It was provided that the
work Should be begun within she months di
from the date of the passage of the act ar
and to be completed within two years. st
Company Refuses to Build. m
It was learned today that the railroad P?
company has advised the Navy Depart- re
meat that it cannot see its way clear to
build the tracks as prescribed by Congress.
More than six months have elapsed
since the passage of the act. it is pointed
out, and the construction has not been OI
commenced. bi
Before the passage of the act of May g(
27. 1908, proceedings had been Instituted tt,
,by the government In the Supreme Court
* of the District of Columbia to restrain w
the railroad company from its contemplated
action in removing the present de
track connections. The injunction was dt
granted and is still in force. The rail- hs
road company now threatens to ask for in
the dissolving of the writ in order that it qi
may proceed to remove the tracks, which bl
cuter the navy yard at the M street gate, in
The railroad officials declare that the
United States government should build
and own the proposed track from the
vicinity of the Pennsylvania avenue _
bridge, ' which," they add. "is as much.a w
part of the navy yard plant as any other
constituent portion of it."
The railroad authorities, therefore, have
positively declined to proceed with the in
construction of the track named by Con- ei
grass and announce their intention of removing
the M street tracks as soon as
possible. This will, if carried into effect. ?
leave the gun factory without means of
transportation for the heavy naval ord- K
nance and other weighty supplies, except
by the ancient methods of trucks hauled b?
through the streets of Washington hy M
oxen, mules and horses. As this means in
would We entirely inadequate, it is the
opinion of naval officials that a discharge v<
of approximately 2,000 men would be nec- w
sssary. F
Appeal to Congress;
To meet the emergency it Is said the gi
Navy Department has incorporated In its
estimates to be submitted to Congress a
request for an appropriation of $303,083.33 ^
for the construction of the proposed sid- p
lng, Including the acquisition, of the nec- cc
essary lands and rights of way. *h
In order to reduce complaints of c-itl- fa
sens in the southeast to a minimum. Rear
Admiral Lcutzc has caused all the railroad
switches In the northwest portion of the R
yard to be turned about, so that no more
Dmivuiii( vn uniiiiiK oi cars win nave
to be carried on outside of the yard in
the public streets. The gate at M street
is closed and is only opened to allow the B
passage of trains in and out of the yard, lo
bout twice each day. *
In view of the threatened disaster to the fr
yard, steps are being taken to interest in *
the matter all the citizens" association* of diJ
the District, the patriotic organizations h*

The night of December 4-i?, while the ves 1

uch the worst since the grounding, the
ind blowing with such force that had
le ship been still on the rocks she very
fry likely would have been fatally damped.
The report says:
"Hours were consumed in trying to tow
le ship. Her draught, eleven feet and
venty-nine feet, and the heavy list to
arboard made steering impossible, so
lat she took rank sheers, parting the
awsers, etc. By 8 p.m., the dangers that
ireatened were loss of air pressure, for

J
"The open air port was in the stateroom

NEW YORK, December lC.-Next week,
for the second time in his 'ife. Thornton
Jenkins Hains, college graduate, author
and master mariner, is to be put on trial
for his life. He will be arraigned Monday
before Justice Frederick E. Crane of
the supreme court at Flushing L,. I.,
charged with the murder of William E.
Annis. publisher of Recreation Magazine.
August 15. 1908.
It is charged that Hains, with drawn revolver,
intimidated spectators who saw his
brother. Capt. Peter C. Hains. jr., U.S.A..
shoot Annis. and aided and abetted his
brother in the act.
It was in 1891 that T. J. Hains. charged
with a capital offense, first faced the
jury. The pleh of self-defense won a verdict
of acquittal.
T. J. Hains will have spent about four
months in jail when he is taken from his
cell to the courtroom Monday. The jail
is in Iyong Island City and the trip to the
courthouse occupies forty minutes by an
uncertain trolley schedule.
Sheriff Harvey of Queens county said
today that the prisoner and, his guards
would travel back and forth each day on
the trolley.

Nearly ,'100 ta'esmen have been summoned
for the trial. Forty compose the

wife of Capt. Peter C. Hains. Jr., will not
appear as a witness at the trial and that
she will-in fact, remain in Massachusetts,
where a subpoena of New York courts is
inoperative.
Attorney John A. Mclntyre is said to
i contemplate calling Capt. Hains as a

insanity is pleaded in Capt. Hains' behalf,

in his mental condition.
WEST SHORE CARS ROBBED.

railroad, two men who said they were
j Charles Cohen. 26 years old, of 44l> Michigan
avenue, Buffalo, and Jack Barney,
years old. of 2.T0 Seneca street. Buffalo,
were arrested here today. The arrests
were made on complaint of William Burch
of Buffalo, an agent of the West Shore
railroad.
For months past that railroad has been
a heavy sufferer from trajn robbers. Cars
on the way from Buffalo to New York
were opened and thousands of dollars'
worth of merchandise taken. Although
some of the cleverest of the railroad detectives
were assigned to the case they
could not find where the cars ware broken
open. One car was broken open and
$1,300 worth of merchandise was removed.
According to the police the
| thieves hid their loot away for a while,
then packed It in fresh cases and shipped
it 011 to this city or elsewhere, consigned
to confederates who disposed of it In various
ways. It is said by. the authorities
that there was $1,300 worth of the stolen
freight In the lodging rooms in which
Cohen and Barney were found.

iNORITYNQTIII HOW
Censure to President Affair of
Republican Senators.
RETALIATION UP TO THEM
Democratic Colleagues Willing to
I
Vote for Resolution.
NO SKIN OFF THEIR NOSES
Assert That Criticism in Message
Was Not Aimed at Them?Would
Uphold Dignity of Congress.
No democratic senator will introduce
the resolution by means of which the
Senate expects to censure President
Roosevelt next week for his criticism of
Congress in comments on the secret service
in the recent annual message. Several
prominent democratic senators made this
understood today.
The way the democratic senators look
'upon the matter was clearly explained
by one of them?a southerner?who.
though he' says he has never had a personal
quarrel with the President, has not
spoken to him for the past six years,
merely because he doesn't like him and
his methods.
"This is distinctly *the affair of the republicans
in the Senate as well as in ther
House." declared this senator. "They
should by all means act first. Have you
ever heard any hint ihat the secret service
was employed to investigate a democratic
senator? Are not the republicans
the only ones who have been criticised by
the President?
Willing to Vote for Censure.
"I want to say, however, that if the
republicans do introduce a resolution censuring
the President for what he said in
his message democrats in the Senate will
vote for It. I consider the President's statement
as insulting to Congress. And I
believe every other democratic senator
will not hesitate a moment in voting to
uphold the dignity and honor of Congress.
"I know the republicans have a resolution,
the purpose of which is to expunge
from the records the objectionable portion
of the President's message. I don't
u ^ ;i* i.. I* i ii. (it
nnuw who win imruauce 11 or wurn 11 win
be Introduced.. But I know how I will act
when it is introduced."
There is a disposition today among republican
senators* to defer action on the
message until after the special committee
appointed yesterday by the House shall
have reported and the House shall have
acted upon its report. If this is the case
the Senate will not take up the matter
next Monday or Tuesday, as it was believed

A republican senator, in close touch with
what is going on, said today that he did
not believe there would be any serious opposition
by friends of the President in the
Senate to the passage of a resolution of
mild censure. The matter of a tight on
the floor over the matter, he intimated,
would depend altogether on the character
of the resolution.
"The strongest form which such a resolution
could take," he said, "would be to
expurge from the records the disparaging
statements of the President. I do not
believe the form of the resolution has yet
been determined upon. We may wait to
see what the final action of the House
is."
Committee Will Not Hurry.
There was no meeting today of the special
committee appointed yesterday by
Speaker Cannon to consider that portion
of the President's message in which language
is used which is held to reflect upon
members of Congress.
The committee will not meet until Monday
and probably will not bring in a report
until just before Congress adjourns
for the Christmas holidays.

It will liave no investigation 10 make. Its
principal duty will be to draw up a resolution
making a recommendation as to the
disposition of that portion of the President's
message relating to the secret
service.
It is well known that this recommendation
will be to the effect that the offending
section be laid upon the table.
When the resolution comes up for action
in the House there probably will be some
debate upon it. It is not be ieved that
any member will take advantage of the
opportunity to roast the President in a
sensational way.
One reason that the committee will not
bring in its report earlier is that time will
be given to members of Congress to cool
off.
IMMENSE COAL FILE AFIRE.
Factory W^lls So Hot They Are
Likely to Collapse.
DOWAGIAC, Mich.. December 12.?A
peculiar tire which has been burning for
three days in a pile of 4,001) tons of soft
coal at the big stove plant here of the
Beckwith estate is threatening the factory
today. The coal pile is thirty to
thirty-five feet deep, is surrounded on
three sides by factory wails, and is open
to the sky. The surrounding walls have
grown so hot today that they are likely
to collapse.
Gas from the burning coal has overcome
a dozen of the men who are fighting the
fire. Frequent explosions keep throwing
masses of the coal out on the firemen.

signatures to tlie new Franco-American
treaty of extradition . wi.ll take place in
Paris in a few days. Ambassador White
has been authorized to sign for the United

MftY MAKESTATEMENT
Expression From President
Regarding Canal Purchase.
GETTING FACTS TOGETHER
Proposed Prosecution of Accusers for
Libel.
INITIATIVE IS WITH JEROME
Bill for Compensating Injured Em*
ployes Favored?Pardon for
Bank Official Asked.
Provident Roosevelt may make another
statement regarding the payment for tha
Panama canal, which has been the subject
of such wide discussion lately. He is
considering the nnestion Nnthlne definite
could be learned today as to when the
statement may be made public or the nature
of the contents. That the President
Is accumulating information from various
sources, however, is known, and that
he may make use of this in some manner
is also known.
The most important phase of the situation
relates to the intimation of the President
that if he can reach certain people i
by criminal libel proceedings he will do
so. It develops that there Is no federal
law of criminal libel and nothing under
which officials of the United States can
act by direction of the President.
It is said that the President was aware
of this' when he gave utterance to the
threat of proceedings, and that efforts
are being directed upon District Attorney
Jerome in New York to have him lay the
facts before the grand Jury there. Tha
pressure upon Mr. Jerome is being directed
through United States Attorney Stlmson
in New York. The administrat on feels
that there is at least an unwritten code
of coartesy between the prosecuting officials
of the United States and the state*
and counties, and it is to this that an appeal
is apparently being made.
Must Be Begun by Jerome.
Any action against persons In New
York connecteed with newspapers there
charging criminal libel of the President
or his brother-in-law. Douglas Robinson,
or any one else, would have to be started
through the district attorney of New
York county.
The interesting point of a prosecution
in New York would be the question of
who would be the comnlainant. If the
President were the complainant he would
have to become the leading prosecuting
witness.
This would probably interfere with hit
trip to Africa, as the case could not
come to trial until after the time for the
5resident to leave for his proposed hunt.
o such objection would srisd jn the case
of Douglas Robinson, who nas several
times discussed with the president the accusational
and who denounces them as
bitterly as does the President. Mr. Robinson
Is d citizen of New York.
Should District Attorney Jerome decide
to move for an indictment before the
grand jury and secure one he would have
the fullest aid of the legal machinery of
the administration and access to every
paper connected with the canal transaction.
The handling of the editor of the Indianapolis
News upon charges either criminal
or civil will h? left to C. P. Taft. it
is said, although Mr. Taft. if lie makes a
move, will have the aid of the federal
officials, as would Mr. Robinson.
Compensation for Injured Employes
Representative Sabath of Chicago is
much pleased because the President has
several times assured him that he favors
the bill of the Illinois man for compensation
of injured employes. Mr. Sabath
talked with the President again today on
the subject. "The President tells tne
tnai ne win gladly aid me in every way
possible in having my bill enacted into a
law." said Mr. Sabatli. "and I am delighted
with his favorable opinion of the
measure. My bill is framed largely after
the laws that now govern on this subject
in both England and Germany. These
and other countries abroad* now fully recognize
the fairness of granting compensation
to employes Injured in the service
gf employers.
"The two greatest men of their day in
England and Germany. Gladstone and
Bismarck, respectively, worked on this
problem about the same time, and both
worked out laws that automatically pay
for injurie ? Under my bill" a commission
would be provided, and this body would
have examiners pass upon each case of
injury, fixing the damages- according to
the terms of the law.
"The United States will have to come
to a law of this kind, and the sooner the
relations between employes and employer
are adjusted upon this basis the better it
will be all around."
Will Attend Two Dinners.
President Roosevelt will attend two dinners
tonight. The first will be the annual
dinner of the Boone and Crockett
Club at the Metropolitan Club. The President
will go there at 8 o'clock. The
second will be the Gridiron Club dinner,
which the President will attend about
10:30 o'clock. The Boone and Crockett
Club Is composed of noted hunters and
sportsmen, and the President never fails
to attend the annual dinner.
Earl of Warwick Tells of Africa.
The Earl of Warwick of England dined
at the White House last night and related
to the President many interesting
experiences in Africa.
Pardon Asked for Bank Official.
Representatives Keifer, Cole and Ansberry
of Ohio and Representative Landis
of Indiana called on the President today
to seek a pardon for Edwin Fiioktnger. a
manufacturer of Galion, Ohio, who was
convicted of participation in the wrecking
of a national bank at that point and sentenced
to seven years in prison. The
President was told that although Mr.
Flicktnger was an officer of the bank he
knew little about Its operations, and
should not be held responsible for tihe
dishonesty and laxity of others. The
President gave his callers to understand
that lie was little disposed to grant pardons
or commute sentences o" bank olflcials
and favored severe punishment. He
was willing that the Department of Justice
should go into the case and report to
him tor consideration.
Assayer at Salt Lake.
Senator Smoot has recommended to
the President tlift nomination of J. U.
Eldridge to be assayer-In-chief of tl^
new assay office at Salt Lake, and as no
other names are before the President the
recommendation will doubtless be carried
out. Mr. Eldridge is said to be wen
fitted for the position.
Senator Cummins Learning.
Senator Cummins of Iowa believes he
is learning the ropes in the Senate ae
rapidly as most new men do. He called
on the President today. Responding to a
facetious inquiry aa to bow he was get
