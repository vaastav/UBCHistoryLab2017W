LAW IN LITTLE DANGER
General Sentiment of Upper
House Is Against Repeal of
Measure, Meeting of Thurs
day Discloses.
(By Special State Correspondent.)
Indianapolis, Dec. 11. At the meet
ing of the republican members of the
Senate yesterday and last night, plana
svere laid for the line of action to be
followed during the coming session of
the legislature.
As stated in
these dispatches
a day or two
ago, the meet
ing arranged to
handle every
thing that is
likely to come
before the sen
ate.
It was decid
ed at the meet
ing to not allow
the democratic
Vtett
Ellis Searles,
ernor to make
lieutenant gov
coramittee appoint-
ments. The senate Itself will make
up the committees, and this means
that a majority ' of the members of
each committee will be republicans
and that the chairmen will all be re
publicans. This is not art unusual procedure.
Lieutenant Governor Miller, who at
tended the meeting, said that the
mere fact that the presiding officer
happens to be a democrat does not
make It necessary to allow him to
make all the committee assignments
and appointments' to jobs when the
senate itself is republican. He says
the senate has a right to say just how
Its committees, shall be made up and
to decide -for Itself just how its busi
ness shall be Conducted. And this
view , was , taken by the rest of the
senators present to such an extent
that the meeting . reached a decision
to follow that course.
. Wood President Pro Tern. .
Although the strictest secrecy was
maintained in regard to the proceed
ings of the meeting, it is known that
this decision was reached, and it is
also said that Senator Will R. Wood
of Lafayette, was elected president
pro tem of the senate. Wood is the
senator who near the close of the ses
sion two years ago made such a fer
ocious attack on Governor Hanly in
a speech in which he urged the sen
ate to pass a bill over the Governor's
veto. Ha Is one of the liberal mind
ed members of the senate and a man
of power and tact, and will make an
Ideal leader."
A committee was appointed to make
tip a list of the senate committees to
be reported at the republican caucus,
which will be held just before the ses
sion opens. The list prepared by this
committee will, no doubt, be adopted
hy the caucus.
Fight Against Contests.
Another subject considered at the
meeting was the probable contests by
defeated democratic candidates for
etate offices. A number of the sen
ators had conferences also with the
republicans who were elected to state
offices, and plans were made to fight
the democratic contests to a finish.
State Auditor Billheimer says the re
counts that have been made in many
of the counties of the state have
shown favorable results for the repub
licans. He says he himself gained 67
votes on the recount made thus far,
find the republican candidates do not
seem to fear the contests at all. There
lias been some talk that Fremont
Goodwine, defeated for lieutenant gov
ernor, and Lwrence McTurnan, de
feated for state superintendent of pub
lic Instruction, would contest for their
places but it was announced today that
they will not do this unless the situa
tion changes materially.
Finally Agree on Date.
The democratic legislators have fin
ally agreed on their date tor a meet
ing. It will be held on December 15.
Representative Weils, of Allen coun
ty, won out on the date question. He
wanted the meeting held on the fif
teenth and Representative Zearing of
Marion county sent out notices for the
seventeenth. But Wells had a talk
with Zearing and Tom Taggart last
plght and then announced that the
rneetJng will be held on the fifteenth
at the Denison hotel, which is owned
py Taggart. Zearing sent out letters

Today is being celebrated all over
the state as "flag day," and in many of
the schools special exercises are being
held in commemoration. In Rich
mond, however, flags are floating from
the masts of the public schools and
other public buildings, but no special
exercises are being held. It was just
92 years ago today that Indiana was
admitted into the Union as a state in

INVESTIGATION ORDERED.
HOUSE TAKES FIRST ACTION ON
OBJECTIONABLE PART OF PRES
IDENT'S MESSAGE IN SESSION
TODAY.
Washington, D. C, Dec. 11. The
house today unanimously passed a
resolution to investigate that portion
of the president's message, relating to
the appropriations and secret service
men. It then took up the legislative,
judicial executive appropriation bill.
There is. to be a special committee
appointed in the house to consider the
secret service item in the message
and perhaps make a report as to the
unkind, and inconsiderate way in
which it is considered the president
sometimes speaks.
In the sanate there are advanced
many little schemes to make the presi
dent regret his ways to slap him on
the rist or kick him on the ankle, as it
were. Up to the present, however, the
injured souls there are up in the air.
It is yet being debated in private con
ferences whether the severest thing
to do Is to pass a resolution of censure
or to expunge the undesirable part of
the message from the records entirely.
If some of the leaders in the senate
get a bit angrier they may attempt to
do both.
The fact that the president spoke
the truth In his treatment of the sec
ret service Item is giving them shaky
feelings, however, and they are al
ready wondering what the folks back
in their districts will do to them for
joining the revolt They realize that
If there happen to be any friends of
the president on the floor when the
rebuking machinery commences to
move and there are evidences of
several the whole kettle of fish is
going to be upset by fierce debate and
it will be necessary for all hands to
take sides and be counted.

CHEERS OF GREAT CROWD
Scene In Court Room Dramat
ic One Cries of "Order"
Did Not Stop People When
Prosecutor Appeared.
San Francisco, Dec. 11. Ab Ruef,
dethroned political boss, was found
guilty Thursday afternoon of offering
a bribe. The jury came into court
shortly after -I o'clock, after being out
since 3:.'!o p. m., Wednesday. No dem
onstration took place in the court when
the vxerdict was announced.
Crowds gathered in the vicinity of
Carpenter's Tall, where Judge Lawlor
has held court. There was a large
squad of police on hand under Captain
Gleason to hold the eager throngs in
check.
Ruef was brought in from the coun
ty jail in a closed conveyan-', guard
ed by two deputy sheriffs. When the
vehicle bearing the prisoner arrived in
front of the courthouse the sidewalks
were cleared by the xylite, and Ruef
hurriedly entered to avoid newspaper
photographers from getting snapshots
of him.
The defendant was in a happy frame
of mind. He felt that there were men
on the jury who would not convict
him on the testimony of Gallagher,
i
basing his judgment on the actions of
some of the jurors the previous night,
when they asked for instructions and
requested the court to have read to
them various portions of the testimony
touching on the offer to bribe Furey.
Ovation for Heney.
At about 3 o'clock word passed
through the courtroom that Francis J
Heney was going to vist the scene of
the memorable shooting. At 3:15 the
cheering of the people outside the
courthouse was the signal that the
famous prosecutor had reached the
hall. As he slowly descended from his
automobile he was surrounded by his
body guard, James Foley, who had
watched the attorney ever since the
graft prosecution in this city began;
William J. Burns, jack McCarthy, a
"special agent," and many policemen1
Many people attempted to grasp He
ney's hand, but only those who were
known were allowed to approach.
Heney entered the court room, and
despite the cries of "Order" from the
bailiffs and policemen on duty the big
crowd gave vent to their joy at once
more seeing the Assistant District At
torney ready for duty. The cheering
and applauding that greeted Heney
was heard by the jurors who were de
liberating above the courtroom.
Heney's entrance was a dramatic
one, and was a startling feature of the
day. Not even the verdict created so
much comment as did the dramatic en
trance of the prosecutor and his
guards.
Ruef refused to make any comment,
but not so his counsel, Thomas B. Da-
zier, who bitterly said:
"Do you call tilat justice?"
After quiet was restored and the Ju
rors had taken their seats Judge Law
lor went through the usual formalities.
The foremau. James A. McNamara,
read the findings of that body in the
following language:
"We the jury, find Abraham Ruef,
the defendant in the above entitled
cause, guilty as charged in the indict
ment herein."
Rtief's face grew pale and he gripped
his hands together.
By previous agreement -of counsel
that the bill of exceptions should be
settled later the court set Saturday as
the day for pronouncing Judgment
Ruef s conviction renders him liable to
a maximum penalty of fourteen years
i in the penitentiary.

False Charges, He Says.
Washington, D. C, Dec. 11. Presi
dent Roosevelt is so deeply stirred ov
er the allegations of scandal in con
nection with the purphase of the Pan
ama Canal by this government that he
is thinking of appealing to the courts
to establish their accuracy or falsity.
In addressing the Waterways con
vention yesterday afternoon the presi
dent announced that he wa-j contem
plating the institution of libel suits
against the alleged offenders.
Earlier in the day he had a talk
with C. P. Farnham, an associate of
William Nelson Cromwell, the New
York lawyer, who negotiated the sale
of the canal property to the United
States. Farnham had a great deal of
information on the subject which the
president thought he ought to be put
in possession of.
Cromwell in Defense.
Last night Attorney Cromwell him
self gave out a long defense of his
course during the Panama negotia
tions in New York, and it 3 under

president by Farnham.

not made clear yet, neither has he in

It would be a unique spectacle for
the president of the United State3 to
instigate proceedings of this charact
er.
"I have felt, as the governor has so
well put It," said President Roosevelt!
at the convention, "that no more im
portant service could be rendered to
this country than the building of the
canal between the Atlantic and the
Pacific, and one thing I am proud of
in connection with the building of that
canal is that there has not been legiti
mate cause for the breath of scandal
connected with any feature of the
proceeding.
"We have cause to be ashamed of
only one set of Americans In connec
tion with the building of the canal,
and that iaof those Americans who
have been guilty of infamous false
hoods concerning the acquisition of
the property and the construction, of
thn canal itself.
President's Threats.
"If they can be reached for crimin

ed. If not. at any rate all the facts
we know or ever have known are at
the disposal of each and every one of
you here and of any one in congress
or of all congress if they wish to see
them.
"Next only in importance, from the
physical standpoint, to the Panama
Canal comes the question of the de
velopment of our waterways. This
must be done by the policy of irriga
tion in the arid regions and where
you come from, gentlemen, it is to be
done by making our sea coast lake a
big loop in from the Gulf of Mexico
to the Great Lakes, and we will see
that that work is done just as honest
ly, just as efficiently as the Panama
Canal work has been done, and no
work could have been done from be

WILL IS BROKEN
Jury Decides in Favor of Plain
tiffs in the Martin-
Chitwood Case.
TWO BALLOTS NECESSARY.
CHARGED THAT UNDUE INFLU
ENCE WAS USED IN GETTING
MUTE TO WILL HIS SISTERS
ALL HIS PROPERTY.
It required but two ballots for the
jury to decide in favor of the plaintiffs
in the Martin-Chitwood case, which
has been on trial in the Wayne circuit
court for almost two weeks. By its
decision the jury breaks the will of the
late George Frybarger, of Fayette
county. It was claimed by the plain
tiffs that Frybarger was insane at the
time he made his will, bequeathing his
entire estate to the defendants. It is
very probable the defense will ask for
an appeal. . '..
The jury took one ballot before ad
journing for supper last evening. The
arguments were not concluded until
dark. On the first ballot the vote
stood eleven for the plaintiffs and one
for the defense. On the second ballot
thedefense lost its only advocate. A
member of the jury stated there was
no prolonged discussion. The minds
of the jurors seemed to be made up aft
er they had heard the conclusion of
the argument and the instructions of
the court One juryman said in hi
opinion the attorneys for the plaintiffs
successfully controverted all the as
sertions of the attorneys for the de
fense.
Arrayed on each side was some of
the strongest legal talent of three
counties. The plaintiffs were repre
sented by T. J. Study of this city
Judge Forkner of New Castle, and R.
N. Elliott of ConnersviKe. The de
fense was in the hands of Henry U.
Johnson o fthis city, Reuben Vonner
and the firm of McKee and Little of

treme care to avoid the chance'for er
ror. Whenever exceptions were ta
ken to the rulings of the court, they
were raade a part- of the record so as
to' appear in case a retrial should be
asked for.
George Frybarrer was a mute. He

ARMY OFFICERS QUAKE
OVER THE PROSPECTS
Thought Many Will Be Retired
In Favor of "Younger
Blood" The President May

(By Sheldon S. Cline.t'
Washington. Dec. 11. A lot of peo
ple grow uneasy when they contem
plate the things it is possible for The
odore Roosevelt to do during the less
than three months that remain of his
administration. Already a consider
able number of congressmen are in
the slough of despondency because of
the executive order placing 13,000
fourth-class postmasters under the
protection of the civil ' service laws,
and there Is every reason to believe
the order will be extended to cover the
remaining 23,000 fourth-class office.
And there is a disquieting report from
the white house that the president has
in mind the placing of some 20.000
other offices under the civil service.
including deputy marshals, deputy
surveyors, deputy collectors, assistant
district attorneys, etc.
Lose Their Patronage.
Already, for all practical purposes.
consular appointments have been re
moved from the class of congression
al patronage, and should the president
carry out the program he is reported
to have under consideration, senators
and representatives will have left to
them no more patronage than has the
resident commissioner from Porto
Rico, who has no say in the distribu
tion of offices beyond the appoint
ment of his personal secretary.
Seven out of ten members of con
gress then will be ready to get up and
declare that "a foul outrage has been
perpetrated." The other three in ten
possess unbounded satisfaction ' at
the prospect. That's because there Is
a difference of opinion. Tbe seven
who feel outraged hold to the belief
that the patronage a member has to
distribute makes him more friends
than it does enemies and enables him
to hold on to his seat in congress.
The other three believe a man makes
more enemies than friends through
the distribution of patronage, and
don't, want to be bothered with office
seekers, anyhow. Mostly, such as
these belong to the "high brow" class
of statesmen, who .don't like even to
send out garden seeds.
Army Officers Fearful.
Army and navy officers of long sev
ice constitute another class who are
ill at ease. The rumor is persistent
in circles of the service that the presi
dent proposes wholesale retirements
some time between now and March 4.
Mr. Roosevelt has repeatedly gone on
record as favoring younger men in
the higher ranks of tie army , and
navy, and as. the law provides that
the president may, "in his d I scr ca
tion." retire an officer who has reach
ed tbe age of 62 years or been 45
years in service under a commission,
it is only natural to expect that while
power yet remains in his hands ho
will do something to put his theories
into practice.
In the army two major generals,
four brigadier generals and more than
30 colonels and lieutenant colonels
have passed or are very close to the
age of 62. AH of tbem are subject to
retirement by order of the commander-in-chief.
Their retirement would
furnish an opportunity for the promo
tion of meritorious young officers,
which must appeal powerfully to the
president Nor is there any certainty
that these promotions would be made
according to seniority. There is no
law compelling the president to ob
serve the time-honored rule of senior
ity and be has ignored It in a number
of very notable Instances. Tbe cases
of Gen. Wood, now commanding the
department of the east, and Gen. Cro
zler, chief of the ordinance bureau,
are illustrations.
The navy does not afford so many
opportunities for retirements. but
there are Quite a number of officers
eligible to involuntary relief from ac
tive duty who are not ready to quit,
and they jump at every unusual noise.
Prospective retirements, however, are
not needed to keep the navy in hot
water. The reorganization of that
branch of the service which the presi
dent already has under way is suffi
cient to engage all tbe spare attention
of naval officers.
Interesting Exchanges Expected.
That dnrincT tbe present session of
congress there are going to be a num
ber of interesting; exchanges between
the white house and the capitol goes

views regarding congress and con
