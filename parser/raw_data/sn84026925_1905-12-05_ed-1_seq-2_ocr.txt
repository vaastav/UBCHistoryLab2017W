? The weather bureau's monthly
bulletin for November, Issued December
1, says: Except In a small part of
western Mississippi and scattered localities
in Alabama, practically ail of
the cotton crop In the districts east of
the Mississippi had been gathered by
the close of the month, the same being
true of Louisiana, but in Missouri,
Arkansas and Texas and Oklahoma
and Indian Territory a small part of
the crop is still in the fields.
? The "Black Hundred," frequently
referred to in dispatches from Russia,
is an organization under the control of
the autocracy, and is used principally
for. the purpose of antagonizing
more or less wen uirevim uciuvh<?i?
tlons against the government. The
Black Hundred consists mainly of desperadoes
of the worst type; but they
pose as a political party and so far as
the government is concerned have the
same recognition that is given to other
organizations. The organization
claims to be aiming at the same end
that is sought by other revolutionists;
but when the real revolutionists undertake
a demonstration the Black
Hundred is usually on hand to make
trouble, and the resulting disturbances
are charged to the real revolutionists.
The Black Hundred is under
the complete control of the autocracy.
? An Asheville dispatch says that
Geo. W. Vanderbilt has sold to W. S.
and W. L. Alexander of Charlotte, and
associates from other points, the
standing timber on his famous Pisgah
Forest reserve. The reserve contains 1
81,000 acres of virgin forest, with <
300.000,000 feet of marketable timber. '
The consideration will aggregate '
nearly $2,000,000 in the final consum- <
mation. It Is said that twenty years
(..^Kak
will be required xo remuve n?c iuiuwi.
The deal was consummated by B. F. i
A. Saylor of Rome, Ga., and Lentz & |
Cutting of Asheville. In addition to <
the 300,000,000 feet of lumber, the i
boundary contains one million feet of |
tannic acid, and pulp woods, and 40.000
cords of tan bark. The deal Is the i
largest ever consummated in Western |
North Carolina. It is said that as a
result of the transfer a furniture factory
and tannic acid plant will be
erected.
? Since its reappearance about 1890, (
says a London dispatch, Russian Influenza,
or grip, has appear 1 year a^er ,
year, each season accompanied i.y |
different symptoms. At first it was the (
rheumatic type, which affected the
lungs in its later stages. This was the
most fatal form the disease took af- (
ter many variations. The physicians
report that the influenza this year is ,
of the neuralgic type. Attacks of neu- (
ralgic headaches and facial pains are ,
now enormously prevalent. A Ha-ley ,
street specialist says he believes we ,
are in for a repetition of the head- {
aches and neuralgias of the sixties.
These followed the outbreak of influ- J
enza of 1849-50, after which,so far as ;
he has been able to retrace it, the (
disease pursued the same cycle, finishing
with an epidemic of neuralgic
headache. He expects something of
the same sort for a year or two to .
come. Another authority, who confirms
what the specialist says, looks
forward to the disappearance of influenza
after a season or two. As
some 90 per cent, of the population
must now have suffered from the disease
it will probably not return until
thirty or fifty years from now, according
as the immune population
dies out.
? Washington, Dec. 2: As President
Roosevelt's special train was passing
through North Philadelphia at 7.30 this
evening, en route to Washington, some
unknown person hurled a mason's ;
plumb bob through one of the windows
of the combination car Salvlus. The
implement was of iron and weighed
about two and a half pounds. It fell
at the feet of Major Webb Hayes, a
son of the late President Hayes, who
was a passenger on the train. Fragments
of broken glass fell on Major
Hayes, but fortunately he was in no
wise injured. The car Salvius was
the forward car of the train and might
easily have been mistaken for the
president's private car. Major Hayes
was sitting at the window reading. A
profile view of him is not at all unlike
that of the president. No clue to
the thrower of the missile was obtained,
although the incident was reported
to the officials of the Pennsylvania
railroad at Philadelphia and the statement
was made that it would be investigated
thoroughly. The president
himself knew nothing of the matter
until an hour after it had occurred.
Railroad officials are inclined to the
belief that the plumb bob was thrown
by some boy, as incidents of a similar
character have occurred before at about
the same point.
? The story of an unusually sensational
murder case comes fr6m
Greensboro N. C., under date of last
Saturday. Dr. J. B. Matthews, a wellknown
physician. Is charged with killing
his wife. It seems that the couple
lived in a boarding house, and the
boarder In the next room heard a
noise In their room. The other boarder
looked over the transom and saw
Dr. Matthews injected something into
his wife's arm. The situation seemed
to him not altogether right and he
went for a physician a ;d also brought
the coroner. When the other physician
arrived. Dr. Matthews explained
that his wife had an overdose of morphine.
He was not willing for the other
physician to have anything to do
with the case; but undertook to make
another injection in the woman's arm.
The othtr doctor and the coroner prevented
him. Subsequent investigation
developed -that the liquid Matthews
was seeking to Inject was strychnine.
He had already Injected enough to kill
several people, and it is thought that
his last desperate attempt was in the
fear that his wife might recover sufficiently
from the first dose to be able to
tell the circumstances. Matthews was
taken to jail and it is expected that
he will try to put up a plea of insanity.
? The annual report of commissioner
John W. Yerkes of the internal
revenue bureau, treasury department,
shows that the receipts of the bureau
for the year ended June 30, 1905,
were 3234,178.976, an excess of 38,284,195
over the collections of the
fiscal year 1904. The commissioner
estimates that the receipts from all
internal revenue sources for the fiscal
year ending June 30, 1906, will aggregate
3242.000,000. or nearly 38,000,000
in excess of those for the last
fiscal year. During the last fiscal
year there was collected from the
tax on distilled spirits 3129,512,628;
on fermented liquors 349.459,539. and
on tobacco 345.659.910. In 1905 the
total production of distilled spirits
was 153,259,370 gallons. In 1905 in
round numbers 117,000,000 gallons of
tax paid spirits were withdrawn.
There has been an Increase in the
amount 'of tobacco and snuff manu- '
factured, and in the production of .
beer. The internal revenue receipts '
for the fiscal year on the principal 1
items of taxation are given as follows:
From spirits $135,958,913, an
increase over 1904 of $148,497; tobacco
$45,659,910, Increase $1,004,101;
fermented liquor $50,360,558. Increas
$6,277,094: oleomargarine
$605,478, increase $121,381. The .
?i.- -J 1? thn nen.
quantity 01 gram uwu iui mr ^induction
of spirits during 1905 was
29,927.325 bushels, an increase of
2,239,642 bushels over 1904. The
yield for the next preceding year was
4.46 gallons per bushel. The quantity
of molasses used for the production
of spirits was 18,387,650 gallons,
producing 12,086,329 gallons of spirits.

TUESDAY, DECEMBER 5, 1905. j
Congress convened yesterday and j
the house organized by the re-election ,
of Joseph Cannon as speaker. The i
senate, being a perpetual body, was I
already organized. The message of j
the president was read today. .
A North Carolina congressman is (
seeking to secure the passage of a bill <
providing for daily reports of crop con- I
dltions. His idea is that a reliable j
daily report of crop conditions, under j
government supervision will go a long
way to do away with the violent flue- 1
tuations now so easily brought about ;
by speculators.
The great powers of Europe which ,
are engaged in a naval demonstration ;
against Turkey have suddenly found <
themselves in the position of the man ;
who climbed a tree after a wild cat. (
They want somebody to help them let j
loose. It seems that although the ships 1
of the allied powers are making a formidable
show at Mitylene, the sultan <
refuses to comply with the demands |
of the powers, and now it is up to the ;
powers to begin shooting, and this |
they do not want to do. Unless they <
can find some way out of the dilemma,
they will make themselves very rldic- ,
ulous. The understanding is that the |
sultan would gladly comply with the
desires of the powers In the matter at j
Issue; but he is positively unwilling to ]
take any action that could be con- <
strued as In the least affecting his sovereignty
in Europe. ,
Thhrk Is quite a flurry at Wlnthrop 1
5ver the Christmas holiday question. ,
President Johnson a few years ago decided
that it was not the right thing to l
put the patrons of the school to the
sxpenseof having their daughters and
wards come home Christmas. Many
can afford the expense all right; but
the effect is not good on others who
cannot. Recently the students have
been interesting themselves in getting
up petitions from parents and guardians
and at the last meeting of the |
trustees such a petition was presented
with 326 names on it. The trustees declined
to grant the petition and the
young ladies are very much disap- .
pointed. While there is much sympathy
for the students in their desire to
spend the holidays at home, still there
is a general feeling that President
Johnson Is correct In the position he
has taken. (
It would be rather bad taste to attempt
to deny the justice of the recommendations
that Comptroller Jones
makes to county auditors, assessing
boards and equalization boards, as to
next year's tax assessments; but as to
whether these recommendations can
be carried out is to our mind a very
doubtful proposition. That property
should be assessed for taxation at its
real value is plain, and what foundation
in reason there is for the so-called
60 per cent valuation, we are unable
to see. The practical operation
of this 60 per cent idea has been to
teach the average tax payer to look
upon 60 per cent as par and he would
make his return on a basis of something
like two-thirds of that. The
property of this state Is assessed at a
ridiculously low figure?hardly a
fourth of what it Is worth: but then
how is the assessment to be raised?
For instance, the people of York county
feel and know that they are paying
as much taxes in proportion to the
value of their property as are the people
of any other county in the state.
They are paying more than many of
the counties. Almost everybody has a
more or less definite idea of the
growth and development of the taxdod^ine
habit, and almost evervbodv
understands that if the assessment
were raised to actual values the levies
may be materially reduced and nobody
need pay more taxes than they
are now paying. Certainly there
would be no increase in the taxes of
any man who is now making a return
that is honest as compared with that of
other people. But the question is,
can those people who are now returning
their property at the highest proportionate
valuation be convinced that
if they increase their figures to actual
values, other people will do the same?
Does it not appear clear that if they
now feel that they are paying a larger
proportion of taxes than they ought to
pay. if they make their returns more
liberal, they will only have to pay so
much more? Under these conditions
this class of taxpayers will be reluctant
to take any risks and so it goes.
Those who have all the while been
notorious tax-dodgerH are going to
continue to dodge, and the comptroller
is going to find It up-hill work to
bring them to time. Then again, there
is another factor that enters into the
situation. There are lots of people
who believe that no matter what the
assessment might aggregate, the general
assembly will continue to base its
expenditures on so many mills levy,
and there will be no material relief.
So along with all these things the
comptroller has a big job on his
hands: but he is right and if he receives
proper support at the hands of
the people, he will be able to accomplish
a much needed reform to the
very general advantage of everybody.

talk they state that if Rock Hill want
the road and gives them anything lik
the encouragement the matter deserve
that this road will be built. Thes
gentlemen have the money behind then
and mean business. That the matte
does not cause the business men of thi
section to fall over themselves in an ef
fort to help along the building of th
road is a wonder to some. It wouli
seem that this road would mean man;
and great things for Rock Hill. Th

I seems no blame attaches either to the

s to their superintendent who was In
y charge of it. There might have been
e more Insurance 01 the building and
r contends; but even this Is no reflection.
Insurance rates on property of this kind
^ are practically prohibitive, and there are
but few barns In the country that are

? one-third of its actual value. But
. there is one slight lesson in connection
- with this disaster that seems to be ded
serving of some consideration, and
3 that lesson Involves the idea of keepr,
Ing property of this kind divided or
- scattered. Instead of having a single
^ barn on so large a scale as this, It
would seem a more prudent policy to
e have a number of smaller barns., separb
ated by sufficient distance to guard
'g against one being endangered by ani
other. But this plan also has Its objectlons
and a satisfactory solution of
^ the trouble is not easy to find.
d DAVIS'S LECTURES.
I? In the last Issue of The Enquired,
L there was an advertisement in which

buy a copy of Davis's lectures, pub?
lished In Yorkvllle In 1823, and the
e book has been secured,
e Mr. John T. Latham of the Harmony
a section brought a copy to The Ene
qi'Irer office on yesterday morning
e and an exchange was promptly made
between the parties at interest in cony
slderation of a sum that was mutually
satisfactory.
Is Davis's Lectures on the New Testament
went to make up the first book
that was ever printed in Yorkvllle.
is The author was the Rev. William C.
. Davis who because of differences wun
the Presbyterian church of which he
e was a member founded a separate
church known as the Independent
,g Presbyterians, and after his death his
,f son. Rev. Robert M. Davis undertook
to publish all of his writings.
It was in connection with the proposed
publication of this work that
Patriek Carey, the first printer was
brought to Yorkville in 1822 or 1823.
After one volume was completed, Rev.
Robert M. Davis died, and the work
y of further publication was suspended
for many years, being finally completed
P In the fifties by Walker, Evans and
Cogswell of Charleston.

d The advertisement last week grew
ie out of the visit of Mr. Charles Hv.
19 Carey of Portland, Oregon, grandson
of the old printer. Mr. Carey was especially
anxious to get a copy of a
e book that had been printed by his
Ls grandfather, and the advertisement

RE-ASSESSMENT OF PROPERTY.
Mr. John J. Hunter, auditor for
York county, has just received from
the comptroller general, a letter giving
detailed Instructions as to how
he must proceed In the assessment of
property next year. The letter, so
far as it is of particular importance
to the average taxpayer Is as follows:
Under Code of Laws of South Carolina,
sections 370 and 267, authority
is given the comptroller general to
prepare and transmit all forms and
instructions he may deem necessary
to carry into eneci me pruvisiuiis ui
the tax laws and to decide all questions
which may arise as to the true
construction of the same. The Instructions
thus given shall be obeyed
by, and the decisions thus made shall
be binding upon all county, town
and municipal officers?Code of Laws,
section 370.
I have had prepared an abstract of
the tax laws, which has been approved
by the attorney general's office,
and these laws are transmitted for
your guidance in the assessment of
property and other duties connected
with the tax department.
In the assessment of property
commencing January 1st, 1906, county
auditors will require of all taxpayers
an Itemized return of all property
subject to taxation "at Its true
value in money," which is construed
to mean "the sum for which said
property under ordinary circumstances
would sell for cash."
All returns must be sworn to and
no return will be considered either
by the county auditors or boards of
assessors, unless sworn to. The responsibility
for a full and detailed return
of all property subject to taxation
and its assessment at its true
value in money, rests primarily with
the county auditors?code of laws,
sections, 363, 364, 365. Before the
returns are placed before the township
board of assessors, county auditors
will require each member of such
board to subscribe to the following
oath before entering on the discharge
of their duties:
South Carolina,
Countv of
I do solemnly swear
(or affirm) that I will, so far as the
duty devolves upon me, to the best of
my knowledge and belief, assess,
equalize and value "at Its true value
In money," all property under my
supervision, and equalize the same as
between the taxpayers in my township
(city or village as the case may be).
Sworn and subscribed before me
this.... day of 190....

Township Boards of Assessors.
It Is the duty of township boards of
assessors to personally examine each
piece of property in their respective
townships and to assess it at its true
value in money, a sum at which, in
their Judgment, said property under
ordinary circumstances would sell for
cash. The true value in money or
market value at which you are required
to assess real estate and personal
property for the purpose of taxation,
does not mean Its extreme value,
exchange value or prospective value,
but the actual selling value. True
value in money, selling value and
market value, are synonymous terms
and have been appropriately defined
to be the sum which a willing purchaser
is prepared to pay, and which
a willing seller will accept. Discrimination
must not be made in favor of
or against any kind of taxable property.
Equality Is the fundamental principle
in taxation, and It is only by an adherence
to this principle that Justice
can be done to all taxpayers. You
are to assess all property regardless
of any previous value fixed by former
boards. Whenever the valuation
or assessment of any property is fixed
at a sum greater by J100 or more,
than the amount returned by the
owner, or his agent, the county auditor
must give notice to the owner or
ageni III Hi lling <11 gutu co-n., .?
they object to such valuation and assessment.
they have the right to appeal
to the county board of equalization?code,

board In assessing the value shall not
reduce the aggregate valuation in
their township below the aggregate
valuation returned by the county auditor.
County Board of Equalization.
Your duties are "to fairly and Impartially
equalize" the real and personal
property in the county as fixed
by the township and special board of
assessors, so that each tract, lot or
piece of property shall be entered at
its true value, and particularly to
equalize as between townships?code,
section 381. Shall hear, act upon and
determine all appeals from the township
and special boards of assessors?
code, section 381. They shall raise the
valuation of such real and personal
property as in their opinion has been
assessed below their true value to
such sum as they believe to be their
true value. The notice of their action
must be given the owner of such
property or his agent. They shall
not reduce the aggregate value of real
and personal property below the aggregate
value thereof, as assessed by
the township or special boards of b<
assessors. Any person whose proper- ti
ty has been assessed above its true
value shall have the right to appeal le
to the comptroller general, to whom pi
shall be forwarded all testimony rel- b
ative to each alleged grievance. li
P
GUESSING ON THE CROP.
The local bucket shop was a centre p
of especial and particular Interest*yes- si
terday because it was generally under- jj
stood that the government's November R
crop estimate was due to appear sometime
between 12 and 2 o'clock, and an N
unusually large crowd of people gathered
to witness the lively fluctuations ^
now common on such occasions. u
The average bucket shop crowd is ^
from six to ten people. There are peo- a
pie dropping In and out all the time, of n
course; but the place is seldom crowd- r
ed. Ordinarily, visitors have no trouble
in finding a comfortable seat, and t)
an unobstructed view of the changing c
figures on the board but on occasions t(
like yesterday standing room some- a
times reaches a premium.
At one time yesterday, shortly before
noon, there were as many as fifty "
people in the room. They Included
local cotton buyers and speculators c
and farmers from all parts of the sur- g
rounding country, most of them at- h
tracted through mere curlosl'.y, but ?
others holding contracts and interested ^
in the probable turn in the market it
Ordinarily the bucket shop people re- g
quire a margin of only twenty points,
because under normal conditions this b
Is easily sufficient for their protection; ?
but these various estimates that have Q
been coming In of late have frequently u
caused Jumps of from 20 to 50 points v
in a few minutes and the market has ^
been known to fluctuate as much as
0
a hundred points within a hundred
minutes. 2
Such a situation leaves an oppor- r
tunlty for a dead sure thing of a I
hedge. For ins.ance the speculator *
could buy a hundred bales and sell a v
hundred bales at the same time, and s
at the place where a twenty-point *
margin would be wiped out on one g
con.ract, profits would begin to accu- a
? Bit* tho hurlfflt 1
IllUiaiC VII IIIC VbliCI. OMk ??IV WMVWV.
shop people calculated on this also
yesterday and raised their limit. At the
opening of the day's trading they posted
a notice providing that "three margins"
would be required on all contracts,
thus making themselves secure
to the extent of full sixty points.
January closed last Saturday at
11.34, and opened yesterday morning
at 11.38. There was a rapid advance of
some 25 points and then some fluctuations
downward. The crowd was intensely
Interested and when the guessing
commenced coming in there were
all kinds of comments. The New Orleans
Times-Democrat's estimate put
the crop at 10,155,000 bales; W. P.
Brown had it 10,175,000 and Miss Giles
had it 10,180,000; but these estimates
seemed to have little effect. It was on
the guess of the government that most
Interest hinged. The government
guess was at flrst scheduled for 12
o'clock; but at 12 o'clock there came a
wire that the report would not be ready
until 2.05, and there followed all kinds
of accusations against "Old Wilson,
who is undoubtedly on the side of the
bears." Presently at 1.30, the govern
ment guess came in putting the crop at ^
I U, 10 1,8 18 Dales, tlllU prices w en v. jumping,
not so violently as many expected
to see; but nevertheless Jumping.
January now about 11.60 went to
11.83 In less than half an hour and
New York spots Jumped to 12.36, an
advance of 70 points over last Saturday's
close.
Quite a number of local speculators
are unders.ood to have had contracts
with the bucket shop on the right side
of the market and they all had interesting
paper profits as the result of
the sensational advance; but as to how
many took their holdings down and as
to how many are waiting for more,
there la no way of knowing.
WORK OF THE FIRE FIEND.
The big three story barn on Messrs.
Glenn & Allison's plantation four miles
south of Yorkvllle, was destroyed by
fire last Saturday night and with it
were burned, six mules, one horse, forty-one
head of cattle, twenty-eight
hogs, 700 bushels of corn, 250 loads of
hay, 150 loads of stover, and a lot of
agricultural implements, including
some expensive machinery. The total
loss was somewhere between $7,000
and $8,000 and the Insurance was only
$500.
The fire occurred shortly before 11
o'clock, and was not discovered until
there was no longer any possibility of
checking the flames or saving any of
the contents of the building. Mr. W.
J. Whltener. superintendent of the
plantation, lives In a house about one
hundred yards from the barn lot. He
had been asleep about two hours, and
was awakened by the shouts of a fam- r
ily of negroes who occupy a cabin in ?
the yard, and hurried out to find the J]
work of destruction practically com- j
plete.
The rear of the building had already ^
fallen in and the front was almost ^
ready to fall. Much of the live stock, *
with which the lower floor of the 8
building was crowded had already
perisnea, ana ine uaianue was maiw*e \\
a great commotion; but rescue was "
out of the question. Because of the ?
fierce Intensity of the heat. It seemed [j
impossible for a man to approach v
within twenty or thirty feet of the 1
building and live. ^
There is a well in the corner of the t
barn lot, and a negro man made a des- n
perate effort to get some water to c
throw on his cabin near by. But the *
rope was already burning when he h
commenced the attempt and it parted o
before he could raise the bucket to the
surface. The rain, however, was all ?
the while coming down in torrents and ?
by damming the runways water was
sequred in sufficient quantity to protect ^
the negro cabin and save the fencing j
around the barn. 1<
Of all the live stock in the barn only 1
two head escaped, a fine bull and a
large boar, both kept for breeding pur- c
poses. The bull was not hurt; but the d
boar was more or less seriously scorch- j
ed. Both animals made for the open i
fields. There were a large number of c
fine chlckenH In the barn, and they ?
were all burned, and two chickens j
were burned to death off their roost In a
a tree some fifty or sixty feet away.
When the reporter went down to the
scene Sunday morning, It was a t
gruesome sight that he witnessed. The S
fire was still burning fiercely In a great '
pile of corn, and In a load of oak timber; *
but elsewhere the dimensions of the t!
building were marked only by a Ihlck a
bed of cinders, among which lay the 8
charred bodies of mules, cattle and ^
hogs. The bodies had only been partly h
consumed. In most cases the feet and a
legs and a little above the knees were ^
consumed as were also the hides and tt
flesh about the heads. Exposed bones P
appeared white and bleached, and n
stomachs had Invariably swelled up p
and burst. The buzzards had already a
egun to collect In the neighboring
ees.
This barn was probably one of the 0
irgest and best to be found on any
lantation in the county. It was bulllt p
y Messrs. W. D. Glenn and R. T. Alson
on their purchase of the 640 acre
lantation some three years ago. and v
as 68 feet wide by 80 feet long and c
iree stories high. It was literally C
acked with various products of the c
ummer and fall harvest, and its con- v
?nts aside from stock, machinery and I
nplements represented several thou- 'J
and dollars of value.
Among the burned mules was a pair e
hat had been sent out to the farm the d
vening before and which had a mark- t
I value of 1600. The horse that was P
urned was one Kept ror ine personal??
se of Mr. W. J. Whltener. t
The probable origin of the Are Is un
nown. Mr. Whl.ener went out at 8
bout 8 o'clock with a lantern and a
loved a wagon from the barn to make o
oom for some cattle; but he Is sure t
hat this had no connection with the ?
ubsequent burning. He and others In lJ
such with the surroundings are at a t
omplete loss to hit upon a satlsfac- c
ory theory as to the cause of the dls- t
ster.

Charlotte Observer, December 2: 1
dr. W. S. Lee stated to an Observer e
eporter yesterday that the Southern a
ewer company had virtually dlspos- ?
;d of all the power to be had on the '
lver at present, and that the current
vas now being generated by steam J
ind sold to parties at rates consider- *
ibly lower than that which it costs. ?
le stated that power generated by a
iteam costs some $27 a horse-power, f
ind this was now being disposed at
120 or thereabouts. This is being done
n order to retain the trade until the J
juge development on the Catawba at '
Jreat Falls Is complete. Then the 8
current will be brought into Char- t
otte in quantities sufficient to oper- *
ite every manufacturing plant in the 1
:ity. "We will lose money for 1
iwhlle," remarked Mr. Lee, In speak- c
ng of the move on the part of the *
Southern Power company to gener- I
ite power by steam, "but the invent- '
nent is a good one. Ey the time the 8
lower can be conveyed to the city a
rom the Great Falls development, 0
he people will be educated to its i
lse and we will have no trouble in t
lisposing of all that we have." In
his connection Mr. Lee spoke of some *
>f the experiments which he has I
>een making recently to show the t
laving which Is made by those con- t
:erns which use electricity. He stated <3
hat the ginners of Charlotte, Rock r
3111 and Pineville, say that the avef- a
ige cost of ginning a bale of cotton e
>y steam is from 66 to 67 cents per c
)a!e. Those ginneries which use elec- t
riclty declare that the records of the s
last season show that the cost by c
(lectricity was only 18 cents per bale, t
rhls Is a remarkable showing and
meaks well for water power. I

STATE BAPTIST CONVENTION.
lutline of tho Proceedings Hold In
Columbia Last Week.
"or the Yorkvllle Enquirer:
The eighty-fifth annual State Conention
of Baptists In South Carolina
onvtned In the First Baptist church.
Columbia, on last Friday-evening. Deember
1, at 8 o'clock. The convention
^as called to* order by the retiring
iresident, Mr. Charles A. Smith of
'Immonsville, who announced that the
ntroductory sermoi would be preachd
by Rev. E. M. Poteat, D. D., president
of Furraan University, who was
he regular appointee. Dr. Poteat is a ireacher
of marked ability as well aa
i strikingly handsome man, and on
his occasion fully sustained his almost
ational reputation among Baptists by
riving his hearers a message entirely
nrvnAt.HlofA ao fn flmo onH nloro o nH
laic O0 IV illiiv IU1VI J/MM.V w*ra
>ne that many of them are not likely
0 forget soon. Among other points
nforced was an- earnest plea for charged
work, reminding his hearers
hat while there had been great devel- t
ipment along various lines, comparaively
speaking, the Baptists had not
ncreascd their contributions to the
'arious objects fostered by the church
n proportion to their increased wealth,
.nd assigned as one reason the fact
hat years ago they had gotten into the
lablt of excusing themselves and easng
their consciences by crying "hard
imes" and the old habit in a large
neasure still clung to them, notwlthtanding
the fait that they were now
wealthy.
At the co .elusion of Dr. Poteafs *
ermon, which was listened to by an
.udience which filled the historic ediIce,
the enrollment of delegates took
dace. The total number enrolled was
ibout 400. To one not familiar with
onditions in the Baptist denomination,
lut wro know that there are about
12,000 white communicants In South
Carolina, the fact that only 400, includng
preachers ahd laymen, attended the
.nnual convention, called for the pur;oce
of conferring together and disusing
the subjects of education,
nlsslons, etc., would seem rather
trange, but when told that attendanoe
s entirely voluntary on the part of
very ov.e, be he preacher or layman,
md that as a rule he pays his own
xp<ns<8. the fact that so many actualy
attended is rather remarkable.
After the enrollment of delegates had
teen completed the convention organzed
by re-electing Mr, Smith preslle~t.
The president is a layman and
1 successful business man and has, inliiHln?
thla nna nraalrtwi nvar thft last
hree conventions.
As indicated above the object of
lolding a State convention annually is
or the purpose of conferring together
us to the interests of the denominaional
schools, the orphanage, foreign,
tome and state' missions. The body is
1 no sense legislative, and has no oonrol
or oversight over the individual
ihurches or their members, every
baptist church being absolutely indenndent
of ail others so far as dlsclp*
ine or other matters akin to churoh
rovernment are concerned and none
ire 'forced to oontribute to any of the
i'<j?cls fostered by the denomination,
til contributions are entirely volun* ?
ary.
On 8aturday the greater part of the
nornlng session was devoted to read*
ng reports made by the various
toards. These reports were full of Inert
st to Baptists and showed that
luring the past year there had been a
narked increase along all lines, such
is increase in membership, attendance
it the various schools under the care
>f the convention, and In contributions,
he !atttr for ber.evolence alone, such
is missions, the orphanage, old worn
tut preachers, aggregating In round
lumbers 180,000.
On Sunday practically all the Proest&nt
pulpits in the city, both white
ind colored, were filled by visiting
3apt)st preachers. In the afternoon at
he convention ? church a notable ad*
Iresa on the subject of Foreign Mislions
was delivered by Rev. Dr. R. J,
iVilllngham, secretary a^d treasurer of
he Foreign Mission Board of the
'outturn Baptist convention. Dr. WU- **
Ingham Is a man of giant Intellect and
las the ability .of presenting the ordllarl'y
considered dry subject of For>lg7i
Missions in such a manner as to
:ommand the undivided, yes almost
>reathless attention of any audience,
md on Sunday^ afternoon many who
lad heard him often before were satisled
that he haul never befots been
tulte so eloquent or earnest.
A matter that Is being agitated by tome
of the Baptists at present, eape- ' 4
dally those In and around Greenville,
lometimes designated by the more flipmnt
brethren gs the "Baptist Jerusaem,"
is the enlargement of the Greenrilie
Female college. It is claimed that
he buildings are Inadequate and many
rirls who desire to attend the sohool
ire unable to do so because of the laek
>f dormitory room. TJbe leaders in the
novement for enlargement have aranged
with Rev. L. A. Cooper, formerly
>astor of the church at Johnston, to
ranvasa the state for the funds neceelary
to Increase the facilities. While
he Baptists are great believers ii> G.
<\ C. as the college Is called and hunIreds
of girls from Baptist families
ill over the state have gone there In
rears gone by and paid full prices for
>oard, tuition, etc., and are still doing
10, there are thousands of Baptists,
md many of them are liberal and have
noney, who are not Inclined to help In
he enlargement, and for the reason
hat they think that in view of
he untold benefits the city of Greenrllle
has derived from having the
ichool there from a financial, social
md religious standpoint, she should
vllll"gly invest her own money In the
mterprlse and not expect the Baptists
uitslde the community not only to
>end their girls there, pay full prices
or the privilege and In addition furilsh
even a part of the money necesary
to enlarge the plant. While the
vriter made no special inquiry as to
vhat other towns might do during the
invention, he did hear one brother
vho is able to "deliver the goods" say
if money Is what Is wanted, my
dea Is to make a bona flde, guaranteed
Irrevocable offer to locate the
:ollege In any city or town In South
;aroiina wnicn win guanuiiee me iiu a st
amount of cash. I am sure I can
