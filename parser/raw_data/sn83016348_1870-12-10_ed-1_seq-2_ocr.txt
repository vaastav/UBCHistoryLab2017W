ELKTOX, DECEMBER 10, !MO. j
t
The President's Message.
11
The message was delivered to Congress, | (
at one o’clock, on Monday. It is generally t
pronounced an able, bold, clear document •
on our National affairs, and will be accepted i ,
by the Republican party and the people ■ ;
generally with satisfaction. We herewith i 1
append a synopsis of the message, which I
is all that our limited space will allow:
With the restoration of Georgia to rep- i
resentation in Congress, which may be !
expected very soon, the work of reconstrnc- c
tion will be complete, and, the President
thinks, with an acquiescence of the whole
people in the obligation to pay promprly
the national debt, and to recognize the i
amendments to the Constitution, there is .
no reason why we should not advance in
national prosperity and happiness as no
other nation has done after so devastating
a war.
The new Government of France having
applied to our Government to use its good
olliees in the interest of peace, the Presi
dent answered that the established policy
and the true interests of the United States
forbade all interference in European ques
tions jointly with European Powers. — 1
Should the time, however, come when the
action of the United States can hasten the i
return of peace by a single hour, that
action will be heartily taken.
Hut little is said in the message about
Cuba, except that reparation for damage to
the persons or property of American citi
zens has been made by Spain.
The annexation or purchase of San
Domingo is again pressed on the attention
of Congress, and the opinion expressed
that it will fall into European hands so
soon as it is ascertained that the purchase
has been abandoned by the United States.
Ban Domingo now has a population of
120,000 souls, and the President says it is
capable of supporting a population of 10,-
000,000 of people in luxury. The people
yearn for the protection of our free insti
tutions and laws, and the President asks,
“ Shall we refuse them?’’ Its possession
by us will budd up a coastwise commerce
of immense magnitude, which will go far
towards restoring to us our lost merchant
commerce. The President concludes this
branch of his Message with a review of the
many advantages to flow from its early
acquisition, and recommends that a joint
resolution be passed authorizing the Exec
utive to appoint a commission to negotiate
a treaty with the authorities of San Domingo
for its purchase, and then it can le determ
ined by a resolution of annexation, as in
the case of Texas.
The President is very dec.(led on the
question of the Alabama claims, and says
that our unalterable convictions are that
the British Government was guilty of gross
negligence. The appointment of a Com
mission to settle these claims, and pay them
by the Government, is recommended, so
that the Government may own them, and
have full possession and responsible control
of all the demands against Great Britain.
The unfriendly course of the Canadian
authorities towards our ilshermen, anil the
statutes for condemnation of American
vessels, the President says, will not be per- ;
nutted, and if attempted it would become 1
his duty to take steps to protect the rights i
of citizens of the United States. Any
attempt to enforce the claims put forth will |
be regarded as in contravention of the
treaty, and the Imperial Government will
be held responsible. Congress is asked to
empower the President to suspend by proc
lamation the operation of laws authorizing
the transit of goods in bond to Canada,
and, if such an extreme measure should
become necessary, to prohibit vessels of
the Dominion of Canada, from entering
the waters of the Uuited States, which he
cites various precedents in other countries
to show belong exclusively to the commerce
of the United States.
The encouragement of American iron
ship building is strongly recommended. —
The building of a State Department is
urged as a matter of necessity.
Such measures as will load to an eaily j
resumption of specie payments are strongly
recommended.
On this subject the President says:
The average value of gold as compared
with national currency for the whole of
the year I8fi!) was about 1114, and for eleven
months of 1870 the same relative value has
been about lid. The approach to a specie
basis is very gratifying, but the fact can
not be denied that the instability of the
value of our currency is prejudicial to our
prosperity, and tends to keep up prices to
the detriment of trade. The evils of a
depreciated and fluctuating currency are
so great that now, when the premium
on dold has fallen so much, it would seem
that the time has arrived when by wise
and prudent legislation Congress should
look to a policy which would place our cur
rency at par with gold at no distant day.
The tax collected from the people has been
reduced more than eighty millions of dollars
per annum. By steadiness in our present
course, there is no reason why, in a few
short years, the national tax-gatherer may
not disappear from the door of the citizen
almost entirely. With the revenue stamp
dispensed by postmasters in every com
munity, a tax upon liquors of all sorts and
tobacco in all forms, by a wise adjustment
of the tariff which will put a duty only
upon those articles which we could dispense
with, known as luxuries, and on those
which we use more of than we produce,
revenue enough may be raised after a few
years of peace and consequent reduction of
indebtedness to fulfil all our obligations.
A further reduction of expenses in addition
to a reduction of the interest account may
be relied on to make this practicable.
On the new question of “Revenue
reform, ’’ the President strikes Senator
Trumbull and his party a damaging blow
in the following paragraph:
Revenue reform, if it means this, has my
hearty support. If it implies a collection
of the revenue for the support of govern
ment, for the payment of principal and
interest of the public debt, pensions, Ac.,
by directly taxing the people, then I am
against revenue reform, and confidently
believe the people are with me. If it
means failure to provide the necessary
means to defray all the expenses of the
Government, and thereby repudiation of
the public debt and pensions, then I am
still more opposed to such kind of revenue
reform. Revenue reform has not been
defined by any of its advocates to my
knowledge, but seems to be accepted as
8 imething which is to supply every man’s
wants without any cost or effort on his
part. A true revenue reform cannot be
made in a day, but must be the work of
national legislation and of time. As soon
as the revenue can be dispensed with, all
duty should be removed from coffee, tea,
and other articles of universal use not pro
duced by ourselves.
The necessities of the country compel ns
to collect revenues from our imports. An
army of assessors and collectors is not a
pleasant sight to the citizen, but that on a
tariff for revenue is necessary. Such a
tariff, so far as it acts as an encouragement
to home production, affords employment to
labor at living wages in contrast to the
pro|>er labor of the Old World, and also in
the development of home resources.
The message refers to the Rost Office
Department as follows:
The accompanying rej ort of the Post
master General shows a most satisfactory
working of that department. With the
adoption of the recommendations contained
therein, particularly those relating to a
reform in the franking privilege, and
the adoption of the correspondence
cards, a self-sustaining postal system
may speedily be looked for, and at no dis
tant day a further reduction of the rate o
postage be attained. I recommend aothori
zation by Congress to the Postmaster Gen
eral and Attorney General to issue all com
missions to officials appointed through
their respective departments.
At present these commissions, where
appointments arc Presidential, are issued '
by the State Department. The law in all
the departments of the Government, except J
those of the Post Office and of Justice,
authorizes each to issue its own commis
sions.
“ Civil service reform ” meets the hearty 1
approval of the President, and he would
have it go further than the mere tenure of
office of clerks and employees whose
appointment dives not require “the advice
and consent of the Senate.” Ho would 1
have it govern not only the tenure, but the '
manner of appointment, so that the (
President, Heads of Departments and mem- ’
hers of Congress should lie relieved from 1
the trouble and embarrassment growing 1
out of it. The elevation and purification 1
of the civil service, says the President
“ will be hailed with approval by the whole
people of the United States.” j 1
The policy inaugurated by the present | j
administration of employing friends and I
other missionary agencies for the purpose i ]
of civilizing and managing the Indian is i i
declared to have worked well, and promises
the best possible results.
The concluding paragraph of the message
thus britly sums up the position of tho
Administration upon all national and politi
cal topics. The President says;
“In conclusion, 1 would sum up the
policy of the Administration to be a thor
ough enforcement of every law, a faithful
collection of every tax provided for,
economy in this disbursement of the same,
a prompt payment of every debt of the
nation, a reduction of the taxes as rapidly
as the requirements of tho country will
admit—the reduction of taxations and
tariff to be so arranged as to afford tho
greatest relief to the greatest numbers.
Honesty and fair dealing with all the other
people, to the end that war with all its
blighting consequences may lie avoided,
but without surrendering any right or
obligation due to us. A reform in the
treatment of Indians and in the whole civil
service of the country; and finally in secur
ing a pure, untrammelled ballot, where
every man entitled to cast a vote may do so
just once at each election, without fear or
molestation or proscription on account of
his political faith, nativity or color.”
The Postiiiaster-GcneruPs Report.
The Report of Postmaster General Crcs
well is a clear, business-like paper, showing
the working of the mail system of tho
country, with its multitudinous net-work
of routes, aggregating in length 2:11,2:13
miles, and in annual transportation, 97,024-
990 miles. Tho public press of the country
generally speaks in commendation of Mr.
Creswell’s administration of the Post-Office
Department. The Philadelphia I'renn says :
“ The Report, as a whole, is concise and
clear in statement, abounds with interest
ing statistics, and contains many important
recommendations, whose adoption will
contribute largely to the economy and effi
ciency of the postal service.
“ Mr. Creswell shows that the affairs of
his department are in a healthy, and. in
fact, a steadily improving condition. The
revenues for the tiscal year ended June 1(0
were $19,772,320.05, and tho expenditures
of all kinds $23,998,837.63, leaving a defi
ciency of only $4,236,610.98 as against a
deficiency of $0,353,020.78 for tho fiscal
year 1869. The increase in revenue for
the year 1870 over the year 1869 was
$1,427,709.93, or 7.78 per cent., and the
increase of expenditures $300,706.13, or
1.32 per cent., showing a net increase in
revenue of $1,127,003.80. Tho increase in
revenue for the year 1870 over the year
1808 was $3,479,019.85, 21.35 per cent ,
and the increase of expenditures for 1870
over 1868 was $1,268,244.98, or 5.57 per
cent. The increase in revenue for 1870, as
compared with 1869, was less than the
increase for 1869, as compared with 1868,
was less than the increase fur 1869, as com
pared with 1868, by $024,199.99 ; and the
increase in expenditures for 1870, compared
with 1869, was less than the increase for
1869, compared with 1808, by $660,832.72.”
Mr. Creswell recommends tho enactment
of a law authorizing increased compensa
tion to railroad companies for carrying the
mails. On this point the Report states :
“After a careful consideration of (he
subject, I am satisfied that the compensa
tion fixed by law is nut a fair return for the
i important services rendered by railroad
1 companies, and henae I repeat my recom
: mendation that a readjustment of their
pay be made by law, and that, at the same
time, they be required to enter into con
tract with tho department as a condition
precedent to drawing any increase of com
pensation.”
He also repeats the recommendation of
his last annual report relative to the neces
sity of some legislation to encourage the
re-establishmcnt of American lines of trans
atlantic steamships for the transportation
of our mails to Europe.
The following extract from the Report
will give some idea of the importance of
the Dead Letter Office :
“ Tho number of packages and letters
containing jewelry, books, and other prop.
I erty was 0,921, of which 4,740 were deliv
ered and 2,181 were filed for reclamation.
The number containing photographs was
38,009, of which 32,978 were delivered and
5,031 were tiled. The number containing
receipts, bills of lading, Ac., was 27,454,
of which 24,200 were delivered and 3,254
were filed. The nuinbercontaining postage
and revenue stamps and aiticlcs of small
value was 45,457."
Mr. Creswell again calls the attention of
Congress to the abuse of the franking priv
ilege, and urges the necessity of its abso
lute repeal. The Report argues iu favor of
prepayment of postage on all matter,
except county newspapers confined to their
circulation in the county where they are
published.
The adoption of a new feature of cor
respondence is recommended in the form of
“Correspondence Cards.” On this point
the Postmaster-General says :
“My attention has been directed to the
new system of ‘ correspondence ’ or ‘ post
cards ’ lately adopted by North Germany
and by Great Britain for facilitating letter
correspondence, and already extensively
used in those countries. These cards are
made of good, stiff paper, of convenient
form and size. The front or face of the
card is ruled for the insertion of the
address, and bears the post-office stamp.—
On the reverse side there is room for a short
letter or message, which may lie printed or
written iu pencil or ink. They require no
folding or envelope, are specially adapted
for circulars or short communications, and
are furnished to the public at the value of
the postage stamp impressed upon them,
which is in Great Britain half a penny,
being one-half the established inland letter
rate of postage. Tho advantages claimed
by their use consist in the increased celer
ity and case of business and social inter
communication, by dispensing with much
of the ordinary epistolary form and appli
ances, and by having always at hand, ready
for use at any moment—in the street, on a
journey, or in places where pen, ink. paper,
and envelopes are not accessible or readily
attainable—the essentials for a letter. For
many messages where the telegram is now
used—such as orders, invitations, inqui
ries, or other requirements of business or
social life —these cards would be welcomed
by the public as a simple, inexpensive, and
convenient means of intercourse. They
would crcatea new postal business, augment
the number of correspondents, and greatly
multiply the occasions and opportunities
for writing. The want has been long felt
of some such prompt and easy mode of
communication by mail, adapted to the
convenience and habits of business men,
as well as of that large class of persons
who have not the time or the inclination to
write formal letters, and therefore seldom
make use of the mails. Believing that the
employment of these cards would be bene
ficial to the public and result in a large
increase of correspondence, 1 respectfully
recommend that authority be given by law
for their introduction into our postal ser
vice, at the rate of one cent each, including
the cost of the card, as a first step towards
a general reduction of our domestic letter
postage.

will hardly “ pass
muster.” The subject is well conceived,
but lacks care in composition, and requires
more thought in working up. Too many
words ami lines are introduced for the sake
of rhyme alone. This never fails to mar a
verse. Every word should seem to be
essentially a part of, and indispensable to
a composition whether poetry or prose.

HR. SCIIEXCK atftviMOH Consumptive
to Go to Florida in Winter.
Having for tin- last thirty-five years devoted my whole
time and attention t<> the study id' lung diseases and con
sumption. I f.-el that I understand fully the course that
ought to le pursued to restore a tolerably lad ease of
diseased lungs to healthy soundness. The first and most
impel taut step is tor the patient to avoid taking cold,
and the b.-st of all pla<vs on this continent f-r this pur
pose in winter, is Florida, well down in the State, where
the temperature is regular, and not subject to such vari
ations as in more Xortle-in latitudes, palatka isa point
I can recommend. A go..d hotel is kept there by Pet. r
nian. Last winter 1 saw several persons there whose
lungs had been badly diseased, but who. under the heal
ing influence of the climate and my medicine, were get
ting well.
One hundred miles further down the river is a point
which 1 would prefer to Palatka. as the temperature is
more even and the air dry ami bracing. Mcllonville ami
Enterprise are locat' d then*. I should give a decided
preference to Mcllonville. It is two miles from river or
lake, ami it seems almost impossible to take edd there.
The tables in Florida might be better, and patients com
plain at times. Put that is a good sign, as it indicates a
return of appetite, and when fids is the case they gen
erally increase in flesh, and then tin* lungs must ileal,
j Jacksonville. Hibernia, Green Cove, and many other
places in various parts of Florida, can be saf.-Iy * recom
mended to consumptives, in winter. My reasons for say
| ing so are that patients are less liable to take cold there
than where there is less even temperature, and it is md
necessary to say that where a consumptive p rsoti ex
poses himself to freipieiit colds, hu in certain (o die
shortly. Therefore my advice is. go well down into the
State out of the reach of pervading east winds and fogs.
Jacksonville, or almost any other of the loe.ilitb-. I have
named, will benefit those who are troubled with a torpid
liver, a disordered stomach, deranged iiowels. sore throat
or cough, but for those whose lungs are diseased a more
southern point is earnestly recommended.
For fifteen years prior to ISfiy, 1 was professionally in
New York, Boston. Baltimore ami Philadelphia every
we.-k. where I saw and examined on an .average live hun
dred patients a week. A practice so extensive, embrac
ing every possible phase of lung disease, hits enabled me
to under.-tarn I the dhtease fully, ami hence, my caution
in regard to taking cold. A person may take large
■juanliiies of “Si-hern k's Pulmonic Syrup, Seaweed
Tonic and Mandrake Pills,” and yet die if he does not
av ; ! t iking cold
In Florida, nearly everybody is using Schenck’s Man
drake Pills, f-. the climate s more likely to produce
billions hah is than more northern latitudes. It isa
•*— .. tuo.iom-d fact that natives of Florida rarely die
of consumption, especially those of the southern part.
On tin* other hand, in New England, oin-third, at least,
of the population die of this terrible dhsea.-e. In the
Middle .Stales it does md prevail so largely, still there
are many thousands of cases there. What a vast per
centage of life would he saved if consumptives were its
easily alarmed in regard to taking fresh cold ns they arc
about scarlet fever, small pox. Ac, But they um not.—
They take what they term a little cold, which they are
credulous enough to believe will wear off in a Jew days.
They pay no attention to it. and lienee it lays the foun
dation for another and another still, until the lungs are
diseased beyond till hope for cure.
My advice to persons whose lungs are effected even
-lightly is. to lay in a stock of Schcnck’s Pulmonic
Syrup, Schem k’s Seaweed Tonic and Scl.em k s M .mlrake
Pills and go to Florida. 1 recommend these particular
medicines because 1 am thoroughly acquainted with
their action. I know that where tle-y are used hi strict
accordance with my directions they will do the work
that is required. This accomplished, nature will do the
rest. The physician who preset ihes for cold, rough or
nightsweats. and then advises the patient to walk or ride
out every day. will he sure to have a corpse on his hands
before long.
My plan is to give my three medicim-s. in accordance
with the printed directions, except in some cas-s where
a freer use of the Mandrake Pills is necessary. My
object is to give tone to the stomach—to get up a good
appetite. It is always a good sign when a patient begins
to grow hungry. 1 have hop.-* of mi. h. \\ itii a relish
for food and the gratification of that relish comes good
Mood, and with it more 11.-sh. which is clo-ely followed
by a healing of the lungs. Then the cough loosens ami
abates, the creeping chills and clammy night-sweats no
longer prostrate and annoy, and the patient gets well,
provided hejnoids taking cold.
Now then- are many consumptives who have md tin
means to go to Florida. The question may he asked. Is
there no hope fr such? Certainly th -n- is. My advice
to such is. and ever has been, to stay in a warm room
during tin* winter, with a temperature of alx.iit seventy
degrees, which should h • kept regularly at tint point,
by means of a thermometer. L t mi'-li a patient take
! his exercise within the limits of the room by walking
j up and down as much as his str-ngth will permit, in
order to keep up a healthy imitation of the blood. I
have cured thousands by this system, and can do so
again. Consumption is as easily cured as any other dh
ease if it its tak'-n in tune, and the proper kind of treat
ment is pursued. The tact stands undisputed on record
that Scln-nck's Pulmonic Syrup, Mandrake Pills and
Seaweed Tonic have cured very many of what seemed to
he hopeless cases of consumption. Go where you will,
you will be almost certain to find some poor consumptive
who has been rescued from the very jaws of death by
their use.
Fo far its the Mandrake Pills are concerned, everybody
.should keep a supply of them on hand. They act on
th'-livvr better than calomel, and h-av<- nolle of its hurt- i
fill effects behind. In fact they are excellent in all casus :
where a purgative medicine is required. If you have
partaken too freely of fruit and diarrho-a ensues, a dose 1
