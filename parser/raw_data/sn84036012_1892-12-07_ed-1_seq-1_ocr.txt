WxsHlHCTOIf.Dec. 6,-The president's^message was read to the srnato and house^litis morn inc. It is as follows:
Tothe senate and house of representa^^tives: In submitting my annual message^to congress I have great satisfaction in^being able to say that the general con^^ditions affecting the commercial and in^^dustrial interests of the United Slates are^in the highest degree favorable. A com^^parison of tho existing conditions with^those of the most favored perns! in the^history of the country w ill itself show that^such a degree of prosperity and so general^a diffusion of comforts of life were never^Iwforo enjoyed by our people. ^The total^wealth of the country in 18110 was fia.lSO,-^lihi.UM. In 1MU0 it amounted to *u2,G10,-^000,000, an increase of 28^ |^er cent.
lUilwayMileage.^Tho total mileage of railways in tho^Tinted Slates in 1600 wasin 1890 it
was1x7,741, an increase of 448 percent.,^ami it ix estimated that there will be^about 4,000 miles of track added by tho^close of the year 1892.
OurManufactures.^The official returns of the 11th census^and those of tiie 10th for 75 leading cities^furnished the basis for the following com^^parison :
In1880 the capital invested in manufac^^turing was $l,3t2,81^.670: in MM the capi^^tal invested in manufacturing was 8.'/^^',-^735,884; in 1880 the number of employes^was l.n,188; in 1890 tin-number of em^^ployes was 7,271.iat. In 1880 the wages^earned were S501,Wi5.778: in 1890 the wages^earned were (1,221,170.454. In 1880 the^value of products was 52.711,07!l.9HB; in^1890 the value of the products was $4,800,-^268,:171. I am informed by the superin^^tendent of the census that the omission of^certain industries in 1880, which were in^^cluded in 18!^^. accounts in part for the re^^markable increase thus shown. Hut after^making full allowances for differences of^method and deducting the returns of all^industries not included in tho values of^189(1. there remain in the reports from^these 75 cities at an increase in tho capi^^tal employed of $1,527,745,004: in tho valuo^of the product of S2.047.2UI.luG; in wages^earned of ftii ^ .944,929, and ill the number^of wage earners employed. 850,029.
WageEarners.
Thewage earners not only show an in^^creased aggregate, but an increase per^capita from $386 in 1880. to $547 in 1890, or^41.71 per cent. The new industries es^^tablished since Oct. 0, 1890, and up to Oct.^22. 1892, as partially reported in tho Antrr-^icaii economist, number 345, and the ex^^tension of existing plants 108. The now^capital invested amounts to (40.449.O5n,^ami the number of additional employes^to 37,2r.1.
Testlie Industries.
ThoTrxtilr World for July. 1892, says^thai dining tho first six mouths of tho^piMMM calendar year 135 new factories^were built, of w hich 40 are cottou mills,^48 knitting mills, 20 woolen mills, 15 silk^mills. 4U plush mills and two linen. Of tho^40 cottou mills, 21 have been built in tho^southern states. A. D. Sheppardson,^of the New York cottou exchange, esti^^mates the number of working spindles in^the I'tiitc-d States on September 1, 18.M. at^185,UXU*K!. an increase of UjO.OUO over tho^year MM.
Theconsumption of cotton by American^miils in 1x91 was 2,390,000 bales, and in^1892. 2.58l.i^^i bales, an increase of 188.0J0^bales. From 1809 to 1892 inclusive there^has been an Increase in the consump^^tion of cotton in Europe of 90 per cent.,^while during the same iieriisj the increase^in the United States has been about 15 |^cr^cent.

whichwas the largest annual production^ever obtained. For the same months of^1881 and 1892, the production of Bessemer^ingots was 3,878,581 tons, an increase of^189,710 gross tons over the previous unpre^^cedented yearly production of 3,088,871^gross tons in 1880. Tue production of Bes^^semer steel rails for the first six months^of 1892 was 772,436 gross tons, as against^502,(180 gross tons during the last six^months of the year 1881.
Exportsand Imparts.
Thetotal value of our foreign trade, ex^^ports and manufactures, during the last^fiscal year, was (1.857,080,01(1. an increase^of $120,203,604 over the previous fiscal year.^The average annual value of our imports^and exports of merchandise for the 10 fis^^cal years prior to 1891, was $1,457,322,019.^It will be observed that our foreign trade^for 1892 exceeded this annual average by^(400.358.391. an increase of 27.47 per cent.^The significance and value of this increase^is shown by tho fact that the excess in the^trade of 1892 over 1891, was wholly in tho^value of exports, for then- was a decrease^in the value of imports of (17.513.254. The^value of our exports during the liseal year^of 1892, reached the highest figure in the^history of tho government, amounting to^(1.030,278.148. exceeding by (14.797,318 the^exports of 1891, and exceediug the \alus of^the imports by (202.875,080.
Acomparison of the value of our ex^^ports from 1892, with tho annual average^for tho 10 years prior to 1891, shows an In*^crease of $205,142,071. or of 34.35 per cent.^The valuo of our imports of merchandise^for 1892, which was $829,402,402. also ex^^ceeded tho average annual value of tho^10 years prior to 1891 by (235,215.910. Dur^^ing the fiscal year 1892 the value of .mports^free of duty amounted to (45^,999.1158. the^largest aggregate ill tho history or com^^merce. The value of imports of merchan^^dise entered free of duty in 1892 was BUI^per cent, of tho total value of imports as^compared with 43.35 per cent, in 1891 and^-^13.00 |^or cent, in 1890.
MilppingTrade.
Inour coastwise trade a most encourag^^ing development is in progress, there hav^^ing been in the last four years an increase^of 10 per cent, in internal commerce. Tho^statistics show that no such per cent, of^prosperity has ever before existed. The^freight carried in the coastwise trade of^the groat lakes in 1890 nggivgutcd 28,295,-^950 tons.
Onthe Mississippi, Missouri ami Ohio^rivers and tributaries in the same year the^traffic aggregated 29,404.401 tons, anil tho^total vessel tonnago passing through tho^Detroit river that yeor w as 211.084.OKItons.^Tho vessel tonnago entered and cleared in^the foreign trade nf London during 1890^amounted to 13.480,767 tons, anil of Liver^^pool 110,941,800 tons, a total for these two^great shipping ports of 124.442.508 tons.^The Vessel tonnage passing the Sault Sto.^Marie canal for the fiscal year 18'rj^amounted to 9,827.874 tons and tho freight^tonnage of the Detroit river is estimated^for that year at 25.000.OUO tons against 23.-^LW.Uil tons in 1891. The aggregate truffle^on our railroads for the year 1891 amounted^to 701.398.ili9 tons of freight, compared^w it 11 091.044,437 lous ill 189J, an increase of^13,054,172 tons.
Iii-pnln In Banks.
Anotherindication of the general prosper^^ity of tho country is found in the fact that^the number of depositors in savings bunks^increased from 093.870 in 1801 to 4.329.393 in^18'i0, an increase of 53 per cent., and tho^amount of deposits from $114,277,375 in^1860 to (252.484.ri03 in 1890. an increase or 91^percent. In 1891 the amount of deposits^in savings hanks was (1.023.079,749. It is^estimated that 90 per cent, of these de^^posits represent the savings of wnge^earners. The bank clearance lis* for nine^months ending Septcmlter 1. amounted to^$41.049.: 90.808. For tho same months in^1892 they amounted to $45,189,011,947. an^excess for the nine months of (4.I90.2H,-^1S9. There never has been a timo in our^history when work was so abundant or^when wages were as high, whether meas^^ured by the currency in which they nro^pnid or by llielr |^owor to supply tho neces^^sities and comforts of life. It is true that^the mat Let profits of cotton and wheat^have been low. It is one of the unfavor^^able incidents of agriculture that the^farmer cannot produce tqsiii orders. He^must sow and reap in ignorance of the ag^^gregate pr^sluetion of the year and is |w-^culiarly subject to tho disposition whi-h^follows, overproduction.
1'srtsProducts.
Rutwhile the fact I have stated is true^as to the crops I have mentioned, tho gen^^eral averages of prices have been such^ns to givo agriculture a fair iiarticipation^in thf- general prosperity. The value of^our total farm products has increased^from $1,3' 3.04O.8C6 in I860 to M.-Vsl.lUJ'*r^^in 1891. as est imnt-'d by statisticians, an^increase of 239 per cent. The number of^hogs January 1.1891. was 50,525.100. and^their valuo (210.193.925. (Ill January 1.^1892. the number was 52.898.0J9, and their^valuo (241.931.415. On January 1. 1891. the^numlier of call le n as 30,875,648. nnd the^value $544,127,908. On January 1. IBM, the^numlierwas 37.0fd.239. and their value^$570,749,155. If any are discontented w ith^their state here, if any lielievo that the^waves or the prices, the return for honest^toll an* inadequate, they should not fail lo^remember that there is no other country^In the world where the conditions that^seent sb ihem hard would not Ivo accepted^as highly prosin-roiis. Tho English ogri-^culturis* would In- glad to exchange the^return- of his labor for those of the Amer^^ican farmer, and the Manchester work^^men their w ugf * for those of his fc-llows at^Fall lliver.
Th-Tariff System
Ibelieve that the protective system^which now for something like 30 years^has prevailed in our legislation has boon^a itrghty instrument for the developm-fit^or our national wealth and a most power^^ful one in protecting the homes of our^woikingmen from the invasion of wnnf. I^have felt most interested in p-os-^|H-ets to preserve ior our woi I.-^ing |n^oplo rates of wages bv wtc li^they could not only get daily bread^but supply a comfortable margin for those^home attractions ami family comfc.it-^and cnjo\ men's w ithout w hich life is^neither hopeful in.r sweet.
Itis not my purjsise to renew here las^argument in favor of a protective ta! IT.^The re-iilt of the recent election must I--^accept- -I as having introduced a new |*-I-^lev. Wo must assume that the pfejo-^ent tat iff constructed u|ion the linos of^pru.^-'^.tiui is tv bv up-sltd aiul that tln-re
islobe substituted for it a tariff law con^^st iiieted solely for lev vn lie; that no duty^is to be higher because the increase will^keep open an American mill or keep up^^ he wages, but that in every case such a^rate of duty is to be imposed as will bring^the treasury of the United Mates the larg^^est returns of revenue. The contention^has not been between schedules, but be^^tween principlea.aud it would In- offensive^to suggest that the prevailing party will^not carry' into legislation the principles^advocated by it aud the pledges given to^the |ieople.
Thotariff bills passed by tho house of^representatives at the last session sere^as 1 supposed, even ill the opinion of their^1^oinotcrs inadequate and justified only^by ihe fact that the senate uud house of^representatives sere not in accord and a^general revision could not, therefore he^undertaken. I recommend that the whole^subject of tariff revision be h it to the in^^coming congress. It is a matter or regret^that this work must bo delayed for at 1^least three mouths, for the threat of great^tat iir changes intr.Hlu'-es so much uncer^^tainty that an amount not easily esti^^mated of business in action and or dimin-^iahed production w ill necessarily result. It^Is possible also Hi it this uncertainly may^result in decreased revenues rroni custom^duties, for our merchants w ill make cau^^tious orders for foreign gissls in view- of^the prospect of tariff reductions and the^uncertainty as to when it will take effect, j
Thosewho have advocatt-d a protective i^tariff can well afford to have their ilisas- 1^trolls forecasts of a change or policy dis-^appointed. IT a system or customs rules^can Is- framed that will set the idle wheels .^and looms of Europe in motion ami crowd^our w art-houses w ith foreign mado gotsls^and at the same time keep our own mills '^busy; that will give us an Increased ^pur*^ticipatiou in the markets of the world^ of j^a greater valuo than the home market,!^that we surrender: that w ill give increased^work lo foreign workmen on product-, to 1^be consumed by our people without dimin- '^isliiug the amount or work to he done!^here; that will enable the American man- !^ilfactures to pay his wot'klllcn from 50 to^100 per cent, more in wages than is |iald^in foreign mills and yet tocom|^ote in our^markets and foreign markets with the :^foraign producer: that will further reduce^tho cost of articles of wear and food w ith^^out reducing the wages oT those who MB*^duee them; that can be celebrated after^its effects have Ix-cn reduced us its expec-^tutioti has la-en, ill Kuropo as w ell as in^American cities, the authors and promo^^ters of it w ill bo entitled tu the highest^praise.
lonplovcrand Employed.^We have hud in our history several ex^^periences of the coinrusn-d effects of a^revenue ami of a protective tariff, but^this generation bus not ft-li them, ami the^experience of one genorslion is not highlv^instruclivo to the next. The friends of |^the protective system, w ith iindiiniuislied^Confidence in the principles they have ad-^vocatcd. will await tm- result of the new I^experiment. The strained and too often^disturbed relations thai exist between tho^employes and employer in our great^manufacturing establishments have not^been favorable to a calm consideration by^thowago earners of the effect upon wugos^of the protective system.
Thofact that his wages w ere the highest^paid ill a like calling in t he w orlil and that^a maintenance ^^r this rule of wages in^the absence or protectivo duties upon the^product of his lalstr was impossible, w'oro^observed by the passion evoked by these^contests. He may now be able to review^tho question in the light of his per^^sonal experience under the operutiou^of a tariff for reve-iue only. If that ex^^perience shall demonstrate that tho^present rates of w ages uro thereby main^^tained or increased, cither absolutely or^in their purchasing power ami that tho ag^^gregate volume of work to Is- done in this^country is increased or even maintained^nnd that there arc more or as many days^w ork ill a year at as gissl or liettcr wages
1for American workmen as has lieen llio
1case under tho protective system, every^^one will rejoice.
Ageneral prttcoss of wages reduction
Icannot lie contemplated by any |^atriotic^citiien without the gravest npprehension.^It may l^s indeed, and I believe it i-pos^^sible, for tho American manufacturer to^compete successfully with his foreign

In any^case, the sus-m-iisiou or American silver^purchases has Ik-coiuo practically a tpics-^tion or it day, and if it occurred might^lead to the suspension of coinage in India.^Certain high authorities Is-lieve tin- sud- I^ileti cessation of purchases ^^r silver by j^America and the closing of India's mints^wniiid lend to heavy lulls in silver ami^disastrous ilisturliauco in commerce,^(libers contend that the fall is already^greatly discounted, itnd th^ removal ^^r tho^present iiiicerluinity w ill have a ipiieting^effect. In view of these divergent ideas of ^^w hat course should bit adopted. Sir Charles^l'reiuaiillc and myself, I'll state frankly,^are puis- nioiioiiielallisla and do not^admit that any other system^than a single gold standard is \^applicable iii Great Britain. Wo^w ill admit the Rothschild ami Levi plans^not to In- incompatible w nh our principles,^but it is not enough. Theso schemes are^defensible ill principle. Would either plan^have the least cliaiico of meeting wuh a^pre|H-ndt-rauce of support that w mild jus^^tify us m recommending tho Uriiish gov^^ernment to consider it^ Wo think not.^Another plan may, however, ho formulu-^ti-d and approved by the conference, ami^if it does not conflict w ith our principles It^will receive serious cousidi-ratiou from the^British government.
Mr.McCreary of tho American delega^^tion proceeded to point out the difllcultins^and perils of the existing situation, and^said w hatever cause, the fact remained^that n remedy is uii|^orulivcly necessary,^lie appreciated th^ attention Koihsr-luld^hud given the conference, hut could not^support his plan, tin could not admit^that it is a proper remedy for America lo^continue the purchase of M iim.uoo ounces^of silver annually at a price not to creed^|n0 cents mi the dollar on condition that^Luropean powers make purchases yearly^to tin' amount of 4.^^,i^i0,011 for live years^at a price not to exceed 43 pence per^ounce, and if silver should rise above thai^price the purchases Is* immediately sus^^pend d. It seems an unciplal distribution^that we bo expected lo purchase tw ice us^much silver us Kuropc. The object of tho^conference should be not to II v a price^which will keep silter below par, but to^eularge the use and restore it to parity^with the valuo it had with gold prior to^p^73.
McCrearyreferred to the complaints of^the British rliamlier of commerce, quoted^recent declarations or Archbishop Walsh^and Mr. 1 ulfour ami contended that tho^situation demanded a broader recognition^and better remedy than siiggesti-d by^Kolhscluld. The American delegates are^ready tociHjperute with other delegates fn^a candid unil determined effort to main^^tain the monetary functions of tsilh^metals. Then-fore after submitting tho^general plan of bi-metullisui favored by^America. Ihey also kiibmitted a plan^favored by themselves, n was a plum^business proposal ami if adopted tho^necessary details could lie easily arranged.^It announces no new theory and pro|ioaes^no untried system. It only o|ssned the^w ay to let uril to the tlllie-lriiHl mill time-^I. .noted system under which gold and sil^^ver were lor many years at par and equal^instruments in exchange. Tho^acts of pa t li inc ut. the laws of^congress and tho edicts or^moiiarchs had changed the real value of^Ihe metals. In older that the situation in^Ihe l ulled States be fully iiiiihtsUhsI,^McCreary explained the position of the^ddlcretit i.. I unil parties utul added that^ho believed the |^-..pie in general w ithout^regard lo isilitical atbliutioii indorsed the^American plan.

'1 he shrinkage in the vol^^ume c^r money would decrease prices uud^tend to co-tc. ntiatc wealth, enrich the^few and Impoverish many. The volume^of g.-ld and silver in Ihe world is neat ly^equal.

Onn Lodge, Dec. 6.-The trial of tho^Most, Unfold, Bunnell company of St.^Paul against C. J. Sawyer st al. was re^^sumed this morning. Just before ad^^journment last evening, the plaintiffs, la^order to show that Mr. Baker, one of toe^defendants, was a partner with Sawyer^and Hoiick at tho time the goods in ques^^tion were purchased, offered in evidence^in their rebuttal certain promissory notes^given to another party by C. D. Baker and^signed ^Sawyer. Houck ft Co.^ This was^objected to as not proper rebuttal,^as immaterial. This morning the i^sustained tho objection of the defendants.
Thisclosed the testimony in the case.^Mr. Kohinson thereupon asked the court^to instruct the jury to And a verdict for^tho defendant Baker. His motion waa^based principally on the ground^that adjudication of the matter^was had in tho courts of atin^sola, and the evidence showed the^to Is- identical. Mr. 11' I Ion toll on behalf^of plaintiffs, stated in reply that adjudica^^tion in Minnesota did not include tho^siH-oml cause of action stated in his com^^plaint, namely, that there was a written^guarantee . n tin- part of Baker for tho^IMiymcnt of the claim. The court in pass^ing on the motion said that whether^Baker had promised to pay for the goods^or not, in law would make no difference,^lr-cause the law* would simply promise to^do so. prov nlisl he was a partner: tbscs^fore he did not apprehend that it mods a^distinct uud separate cause of action that^Baker promised in writing to pay tbe^debt, and tho jury were instructed to find^for the defendant. Baker, as counsel for^the plaintiff had admitted that what ha^called his first cause of action had al^^ready been adjudicated.
Thenext cause set for trial waa the case^or Mrs. Z. ^). Sawyer against James T.^yuigley. This is a suit against tbe sheriff^ns nominal defendant for the value of an^I'.stcy organ seized under execution on ad^^judgment against Sawyer, Houck 4 Co.,^ot Anaconda. Mrs. Sawyer claims that^the organ was lu-r individual property and^not her husband's, w ho was a partner of^the firm. In no- this suit. The cose is^still oil trial. Henry Mahnken, who waa^attested last Saturday for assaulting bat^father-in-law after tho derision of tho^court in tin- divorce case of Mabuken vs.^Miihiikcu, pleaded guilty to the charge of^assault and battery and paid but fine.
