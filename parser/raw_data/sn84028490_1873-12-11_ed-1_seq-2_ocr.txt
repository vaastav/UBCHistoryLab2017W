Mb. Beck, of Kentucky, has touched
the question of the compensation of the

is well taken. We shall see how the sal

- President Grant, in - his Message,
says: "In lh midst of great National
prosperity a crisis has occurred that has
brought low the fortunes of a great pro
portion of onr people." This Grant

' he said apparent prosperity it might have
done.

: At the beginning of the Tweed trial in
New York three lawyers for the defense,

their reason why he should not presid

have been fined two hundred and fifty
dollars each, and reprimanded in a sharp
manner by Judge tavia since the close o
the trial. "

It seems ihe Ville du Havre sighted
the Lcchearn seventeen minutes before
ot.e struck l.er, and then did not avoid
her; much valuable time was lost in low
ering the lift-boals after the collision; no
orders were given, and that the crew took
possession of everything, and that no
life-preservt rs were to be bad, bbows that
the French . steamer was 'niaerab'y com

officers iets the terrible disaster of the
collision. Such an accident could not
have happened upon any vessel in the
Cunard Line.
Tne Chicago Times is honest. It ad

continue to produce Tweedi so long as it

that the diatribes of the Plain Dealer

who voted for him, by the way a mere
formality, ar lost upon the desert air. It
is well to be sure to be right before we
rush in so savagely. But, we suppose,
our friends of these able and leading jour
nals were full of war ar.d consequently
their blood was up. We suggest the pro
priety of keeping cool. Are we not in

No surprise should be created by the
announcement of an increase of nine mil
lion dollars in the public debt statement
for November. And one of the difficul
ties which will beset the Congress .which
is just beginning its session is that of pro
viding more revenue for the Government.
It is generally conceded that more money
must do raised. How it is to be obtained
is the problem that seeks solution. Hep
A Rep.
Of course "no surprise" at all, at all.
The "solution" of the problem of raising
more revenue no doubt is treubling the
powers that be. This increase of kinb
millions in the debt statement for No
vember, should open people's eyes to the
real situation namely bankruptcy. Tne
country has been staggering for years.
Under such extravagance and corruption
what other result could ensue? Under
this financial crisis the revenues are fall
ing off while there is no abatement in
the expenses. Hence, says the Sep. A
Hep., "more money must be raised," and
"how iti to be raised is the problem that
seeks solution."
Great, and apparent now, are the beau
ties of -Radical Grant rule!
Speakinc of the President's message
the CincinnatiCommercial's special corres
pondent at Washington, says this : "The
message has invoked but little discussion
here. It is generally dismissed with a
smile, and it is believed to cover about all
the weak enterprises that could be put in
the space it occupies. The project for
building residences for Cabinet Ministers
and Senators ia set down as ridiculous,and
was received with a broad grin by mem
bers of the House, which gave place to a
ludicrously indignant expression at being
left out in the cold. The recommenda
tions for a National University, an irri
gating canal between the Missouri River
and the Rocky Mountains, favoring Cre3.
well's postal - savings banks, and the
claims of the Board of Public Works on
the Government funds, are laughed at
good naturedly by all save the close friend
of the Administration, who appear to be
anything but pleased with them. As a
whole, the message is conceded to be one
of the weakest papers that has ever come
from the White House."
The era of usurpation approaches a
conclusion. The recent evidence of a
revolution in public sentiment is conclu
sive upon this point. The change has
only, as it were, commenced. The mani-
testations, however, are none the less de
cisive, and indicate unmistakably, the
downfall cf usurpation, extravagance and
corruption. Never were party leaders
more utteviy demoralized by election re
sults thr.n the present radical chiefs. The
wet blanket was so entirely unlooked fir
that it was indeed a surprise.
"Everything, says a learned author,
omes to him wh knows how to wait."
It ia folly to make futile efforts to gather
the fruit before it is ripe. The evil usur
pation of late years could only produce
bad results. These effects are now be
coming manifest and convincing to the
American people. In this connection we
need only refer to the Credit Mobilien
Salary-Grab "ring" performances known
and not known, together with the col
lapse in the financial affairs of the coun
try. The immense grabs by shoddy con
tracts during the war should not be for
gotten; and the currency inflation when
our paper dollar was worth only about
fifty cents on the dollar enabled the fa
vored, few to invest largely in U. S
Bonds. President Grant's first move was
to declare in favor of the policy of pay
ing 5-20 bonds in gold. Grant has been
emphatically the tool of the moneyed
power the willing- instrument of rjngs
and grabbers the persistent friondjof cor
ruptioa acd extravagance.
It is high time this rule bad come to
an end. The people feel the necessity of
a change and seem disposed to enforce it- '
THE DUTY OF DEMOCRATS.
After the late glorious election results
we may venture to say a word to our
Democratic friends by way of counsel
A more hopeful condition of things exist
and all over the country a revival of the
old spirit is manifest. .Under these cir
cumstances let us prudently counsel and
wisely act.
Our object is to restore good govern
ment, banish corruption and establish
economy. Under former Democratic ad
ministra'ions our government was the
cheapest in the world, since the Radical
leaders have had the direction of public
affairs we have the most extravagant and
corrupt government on earth.
Both these propositions are being un
derstood by the people, and hence the late
defeats of the Grant parly in so many
prominent states. The policy is to shape
matters so as to continue the reform move
ment among the people.
To do this we must continue to hold up
to public gaze and condemnation the in
iquities and crimes of the party in power
and to hold out the olive branch of union
and concord to all worthy men who wish
well to the country, who desire to exert
their iafluence to return to justice and
correct rule and to drive from power the
harpies that have rioted in the substance
and trampled upon the liberties of the
r eople.
The Democratic Press, is the chief
instrumentality in this labor. We, there,
fore, call upon our friends, one and all, to
do their duty in subscribing for and sus
taining Democratic papers. Let each
friend cf the good cause, after doing his
duty in this regard, urge his neighbors to
do the same.
This is a good time to renund our friends
of the importance of "taking the papers."
Next fall a new Congress will be chosen
and now is the time to lay the foundation
for good results then and after This
foundation consists in spreading correct
political information. Let our friends re
member.that, in this great work, the Stark
Co., Democrat will labor with its usual
zeal and devotion.
To Democrats then, we say : See that
your neighbors, as well aa yourselves,
take at least one sound Democratic paper.
The paper is a missionary, making regular
vitits and spreading correct doctrine. sxo
party machinery is equal to it and Coun
ty and Town committees should lend a
hand in this important work, See to it,
on and all.
The Doctors is Congress are also about
o prescribe and perhaps do something.
he leading journalists and many others
over the country have been prescribing
for some time past. And all this time
the patient, with much, patience, has coa
tinued to suffer and endure. ,
The Panic surprised all these learned
Uoctora when it came, aa it did, with a
ktartle and a crash, And it continues, in
ipite of doctors, prophets and political
humbugs generally.
' It is a chronic ailment, has been run
njng some ten years, and now assumes
an acute form- The Doctors in Congress
may succeed in suppressing these sym
toms for a time, only to break out again
in a mors virulent form, and with more
aggravating circumstances.
Some of our learned journals clamor
for more inflation, on the principle we
suppose of "the hair of tha dog curing
the bite" like the trembling victims of
alcohol demanding another izorge. But
the prescriptions are variou8 as the phy
sicians are numerous.
Were we a member of Congress, after
taking the oatb to oby and abide the
Constitution of the United Slates, we
should endeavor to have a little regard to
that instrument. The Constitution pre

As we look at it, the duty of Congress

In so doing we lay the success and long

party. TTestill remain faithful to Truth,

Col. Thomas Scott, the' railway mag
nate, has been interviewed and his views
are published on the currency question
He muchly agrees with the President and
favors the new fashioned invention of an
"elastic currency." Wonder if this is not
another expression for the old phrase of
thirty years ago, to wit, "a currency of
expansion to-day, and contraction to
morrow?"
The fact is, "inflation." is only roobery
of labor and honest business, and so is
contraction. Inflation must, in time, re
sult in contraction, and both are equally
ruinous. The experience of the last few
years, especially of the last few months,
should convince all reflecting persons of
the truth of what we say.

The people of Texas on the 2nd inst.
held their State election, choosing Gover
nor, Lieutenant-Governor, Controller of
Public Accounts, State Treasurer, Com
missioner of the Land Office, and a Su
perintendent of Public .Instruction, to
serve the State for four years, and a full
Legislature for two years. The Legisla
ture will have the choice of a United
State Senator, to succeed Joseph W.
Flanagan, whoso term will expire in
175. There is some dispute concerning
the election of State Senators, aa several
Republican Senators who, undpr the
krms of their election, have yot one year
to serve, deny the validity of the act
which put an untimely end to their teim,
and are taking legal steps to retain their
seats. At the head of the Republican
ticket was Governor Edmund J. Davis,
the present occupant of the Gubernato
rial chair, and at the head of the Demo
cratic ticket was the Hon. Richard Coke,
of Wac. The result seems to be a com
plete and overwhelming Democratic vic
tory, the majority being stated at twenty
to thirty thousand.

Tub President's message it seems was
received in Congress with indifference,
not to say contempt. Usually a round
of applause greets sonio point of the
document, but it was not welcomed by
any demonstration fiom any quarter.
Many Republicans in conversation did not
hesitate to make known their disappoint
ment and to freely indulge in criticism.
One Republican Senator characterized it
as a summary of the departmental re
ports interspersed here and there with
absurd recommendations for a national
university, irrigating land schemes, and
other wild projects. The financial part
did not meet with general approval, and
was declared weak aud inconsistent. The
portion relating to Cuba and tho recent
Spanish troubles was so devoid of new
facts and vigorous utterance ss to take
the life out of the document altogether.
On the average the message was voted
to possess less interest than any previous
one from the same source.
There are thirty-four standing com
mittees in the U. S. Senate, two of them
have Democratic chairmen, neither oj
whom took back-pay. The Republicans
have thirty-two chairmen, ticenty-tico of
whom pocketed the back pay.
The House has forty-six standing com

thirty ot whom took back pay and kept it.

Further Particulars of the Recent
Collision.
London. Dec. 7. The crew of the Lo
chearn, which ran into and sunk the Villo
du Havre.have arrived at Plymouth. They
were brought into port by the British
Ouen. which took them off the Lochearn
on the 29ult., at which time she' was in a
sinking condition. The account of the
Ville du Havre disaster, as given by the
rescued crew, represents that the dp tain
and the second mate of the steamer came
on board the Lochearn shortly after the
collision, and did not assist in saying any
of the passengers, and that the majority
of the French crew exhibited lamentable
cowardice.
STATEMENT OF THE CiHAIH.
The Captain of the Lochearn makes the
following statement of the -circumstances
aetending the collision cf the wrecked
steamer; After first sighting the steamer,
and seeing that she was coming danger
ously near, the Captain ot tne Eocnearn
rang the ship's bell and parted his helm,
The helm of the steamer was put to the
starboard, but the steamer came right
across the Lochearn s tows, ltie people
in the first boat from the French steamer
did not sav she was sinking, but the cap
tain of the Loch Earn, observing that the
steamer was settling down, sent out his
boats; Neither tbe first French boat nor
the second one, which arrived shortly af
terwards, bringing the first and second
captains of the Ville du -Havre, and at
tempted to return, but in spite of expostu
lations 01 an tne crew wno wera icn on
board the Loch Euro, aud the threats of
her mates to lire upon them remained
alongside the Loch Earn. The clothing
of the French officers who reached the
deck on the Loch Earn was dry; showing
no sicns ot their Leinrr in the water! in
ally some Englishmen seized and manned
one of the French boats, and went to the
rescue of those btrugling in the sea. The
Captain of the Loch Earn considers that
the great loss of life resulted from the fact
that his vessel drilled such a long distance
i'rum Lje steamer ailer the collision before
it was possible to shorten the sail and
from the tardiness of the steamer in show
ing signals of distress aud from the mis
conduct ot her crew.
IIav&e, Dec. 7. Grand funeral servi
ces for those who lost thmr lives on board
the steamship Yilie da Havre was held in

PROSPECTUS.
m THE world, im
THE great Do moo rat ic Victories of New York,
Ohio, Maryland and Virgioia,the startling Re-
uutiaau ueit-ata ia v lsuonain, iowa, Kansas ana
llinois. foreshadow the election of a Democratic
P'ej-ident in 1870.
Tho necrvt of the triumph already won has
been steadfast adherence te the organization, un
titn'jhing fidelity to the principles of the Demo
cratic party Tub Wsulb has been faithful to its
trust. When fatet hearts talked of a spoiled
party, a dta i party, a new pariy, it bore aloft the
tlag of the hit tor id, indomitable Democratic par
ty. That fla;, inscribed with the logoutis Free
l rade auu i'armers' Kights, Hard Mouey and ne
Monopolies, the Democrats of Obio and New
Yora carried to a K'orious victory, subverting
tirant majorities of 37,uoO and frl.uoo.
A new career now opens before the Democracy
more glorious and more beneficent than its
past career, identified, though that be with the
founding of the republic, its expansion across
the contin- nt, its half oentury of pr asperity and
peace.
Tne open secret of its future, as of its past and
present triumphs, is still a steadfast a-Jnervuce
it the organization, an unflinching fidelity to the
principles of the Democratic party principles
never so needful as now to be applied through
out our National, btate and Municipal life.to heal
the wounds and demoralization of war, to stop
corrupt aud profligate expenditure, to limit and
localize powrs eutrustd to the people's serv
ants to liberate our industries from tho fetters
of a b-u-i-arous Tar ill, our trade from the fluctua
tions of an irredeemable paper Currency, and
our agriculture from the double plundering of
both, a well as to repair the wide-spread finan
cial Unin wrought by the Fiscal policy of the
Republican party.
The duty of Tub Woeuj in this onward march
of tue Democratic hosts to victory, is the dis
semination ef pot i ileal truth. Our work will be
fruitful in proportion aa Tub Wobxa ia widely
read.
We a-k Democrats everywhere to aid us in
scattering the good seed broadcast over the
whole laud during the period so important to the
coming harvest.
Where or how can any Democrat work so effi
ciently for the diffusion of the principles of his
party, and their triumph at the bailwt-box in '74
and '70, as by procuring new readers lor The
