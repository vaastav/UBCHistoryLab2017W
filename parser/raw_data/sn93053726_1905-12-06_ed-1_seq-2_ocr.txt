THE MESSAGE.
The president's message is the all
absorbing topic at present, and the
opinions and criticisms run from high
to low and back again. The views of
the Connecticut men who heard it read
yesterday will be of more than or
dinary Interest just at present. The
lawmakers from this state were inter
viewed soon after the reading of the
message in the. two houses and ex
pressed themselves briefly with re
spect to its various phases as follows:
Senator Bulkeley said: "The message
is a thoughtful discussion of many of
the important questions that are up
permost in the public mind, and con
tains wise recommendations for the
consideration of congress."
Senator Brandegee spoke as
follows: "The tone of the
message is excellent. It Is
well considered, judicial and temper
ate. It again makes it plain that Mr
Roosevelt is president of the wTiole
people and is Interested In and famil
iar with the affairs-of all classes and
every section. The message Is an able
state paper and a valuable contribution
to the literature of the many great
questions which are at present promi
nently before the public."
Mr Henry said: "The presi
dent's message Is character
istically Rooseveltlan, and con
sequently forcible, thoroughly log
ical, notably philosophical. Most of
the suggestions and recommendations
made will meet with popular approval;
naturally some will encounter criti
cism and probably opposition. The
most prominent feature, the lengthy
discussion of proposed railroad rate
legislation, . is comprehensive and ex-
haustive, aud will undoubtedly receive
careful and, I believV1talS8 JtShm fa-aft farms stand it wiffiSUCSaRHsttug
vorable consideratIOBSJ5dpVss."ijan5ving margin. The bank, ifceufcib-
Mr Sperry said. "The message Is a
very fair presentation of what the pres
ident would like congress to do. It
will undoubtedly command general at
tention and respect. Its language is
vigorous and leaves no doubt as to the
president's meaning."
Mr Hill said: "I am much pleased
with the message as a whole, hut the
treatment of the railroad, revenue, cur
rency and Philippine questions Is espe
cially gratifying. The difference be
tween the fair propositions of the mes
sage concerning the. railroads and the
one-sided, arbitrary and unjust provis
ions of the Esch-Townsend bill of last
year, is very pronounced. A year's
discussion of this great subject has
had fortunate results, where hasty ac
tion might have proved disastrous."
Mr Lilley expressed himself as fol
lows: "A characteristic and very com
prehensive document covering a wide
scope. The matters not touched upon
are of very little Interest to the great
body of the American people. Person
ally I favor a'l the president's sugges
tions, and I might add, any others he
chooses to make. No other man more
nearlv voices the sentiments of hit."
countrymen."
Mr Hlggins said: "One cannot but
be impressed with tne magnlture of
the questions before this longrtss and
how vital their correct solution Is to
the welfare of this whole country. If !
doubt ever existed in the mind of a
single citizen that President Roosevelt
was not close to the people and alive
to their needs a carefnl reading of his
message must forever dispel that
doubt."
Apparently we are running into a
period of blind optimism, where men
are ready to act against their own best
reason, says Banker Clews. How long
this will last cannot at present be de
termined, but no settled change seems
probable so long as general business
conditions 1 remain satisfactory, and
quite possibly this will continue until
speculation breaks down through its
own sheer excess. Reports from farm,
mine and mill continue most flattering.
Nearly all are finding a profitable mar
ket for everything they can produce.
There Is no overproduction yet . In
eight and were it not to the disturb
ing influence of undue speculation
present current prosperity might run
smoothly for an indefinite period with
out any obstruction. In consequence
of these condition! values on the stork
exchange are expo d to sharp fluctu
ations. Much activity Jus been shown,
particularly by few clique, some of
which are still heavily loaded with se
curities showing a large profit and
which necessarily will be unloaded at
the first good oip Tiroity, It is evl-

Another. feature' of significance was
the decision of the St Paul manage
ment to begin building operations to
the Pacific coast at once. During the
next" few months the supply of -new
railroad securities will be considerably
increased. The past decade has wit
nessed comparatively little new rail
road mileage, the result being that
west of the Mississippi the country
has fully grown up to and in some
cases exceeded transportation facili
ties. It is quite within the natural
order of things, therefore to see a re
vival of Tailroad enterprise in the far
west
There is not the slightest prospect
of free trade or anything like' it with
the Philippines, says our Washington
correspondent, but Colonel Clarence
Edwards, chief of the bureau of In
sular affairs, has recommended it in
his report just issued as one of the
crying needs of the islands. Colonel
Edwards! who knows the islands and
their needs thoroughly, says there are
three things needed for their mnterial
prosperity, namely, a market, a bank
from which they can borrow on rea
sonable terms, and transporatioh lines.
The government has already author
ized the construction of a thousand
miles of railways in the islands, so the
latter, part of the triple recommenda
tion will not be urged just now. But
Colonel Edwards "says there Is great
need for the market and the bank. To
secure the first, he asks to have the
duties removed from all articles except
sugar and tobacco, which are to be
subject to 25 per cent of the Dingley
rates. This is practically the recom
mendation of the so called Curtis bill,
which passed the house last session
and will be re-introduced with about
the same chance of running the gaunt
let of the senate as it had before. The
beet sugar and the tobacco interests
are said to be the only ones seriously
opposing the measure. They will be
further incensed at Colonel Edwards's
additional recommendation that at the
end of the ten year period conversed
by the treaty of Faris which ended the
war with Spain, the islands should be
given absolutely free trade. This
measure for the relief of the islanders
does not stand much show. But there
will be more friends of the proposal to
establish an agricultural bank. It is
stated that now the farmers who want
to borrow money on their growing
crops, a practice that formerly was
general in the south, but which now
fortunately is dying out, have to pay
from 2 per cent to 10 per cent a month
for the money. It has to be a pretty
remunerative farm that will stand this
sort of uRiiry and leave a living mar
gin to the farmer. Some of the Philip-
11 shed, will be made under the control
of the Philippine commission, though
it will be a private undertaking. The
concession will be granted and the
dividends guaranteed for a ternt of
say twenty-five years and the commis
sion will have the right to define the
nature of securities and limit the
amount of interest charged. The bank
promises to be a paying institution
from the start aud it is hoped will en
able the farmers to Improve their hold
ings and to buy the necessary fertiliz
ers, animals and agricultural Imple
ments. The report also recommends
the extensions of the homestead law
with a view to further encouraging set
