Tlie Mewuige.
Sj much of our *pace in given up to
|'rwitlf?fit menage thin morning that
it really *eeaw nuperlluouaand monoton-.
wlij i.i a<M anything by the way of calling
attention to it* varioua disclosure*,
ftn4* recommendation*. A*
Luoit'l Welwter once *aid about the car
gh,tl? in a certain railroad cane, "there
thtv are gentlemen of the jury; tent theui
loryoiirselw"
It if very apparent to people of orjiojry
intelligence that nobody writea
Geo. (iraut'rt rneswge* but'himaelf. If the
jccuiupli'hetl Finh waa to touch thcut up
jojt a little with hi* diaciplined i>en they
?,.ulil tl?iul>ilei?n lie improved. Aa it i*
th*v unwt Ik- read and appreciated for
(heir matter and not for the grace* of
ityle. The t ienera! should *pund more of
bin leisure at l.ong liranch in'reading up
in itamlard Kngliah, and thu* acquire at
leajt rioiuo little flexibility in hi* manner i
u( exjirewing hiuiaelf on paj>er.
Tito mint gratifying portion of the mes*? |
age i* tliat in WI1I4.U lie ti'iicvun niu uj?prehension*
of the country in reference
lo our relation* with Spain on the Cu-1
l.in question. The me**age Ih Hound on
the ipieslion of non-interference, ami we
can overlook tlie seeming unnecessary
prolixity of the di?cu*aion on that subject
for the sake <>f the wholononie conclusions
arrived at, which are that neither
w :i mailer of right nor ex|Hidiency
would we Ih* juntilled in interlering with
Splint relation* to her colony.
Another feature of the message that
will attract attention id that relating to
thetchooln of the country. Tho ground
taken is in part that taken by Mr.
Blaine, and in aUo a re-attirmation of the
view* expressed in the l'reaident'a I)e?
MoiiuM upeech Home uiontliH ago. The
country in in a humor, after the'late cxinordinary
discunnionn in Ohio and New
Jersey, jo receive the President'* recoiuniendalioiM
in favor of prohibiting
sectarian appropriation* of ncliool fund*,
with dei'iileil relish, hut we have no idea
that the present Congrenn will givo theiu
any serious attention.
Another reference iu the mennago will
alaomeet with popular favor, and that is
it to the propriety of laying Nome tax on
theenonuoiiH ami font increasing accumulations
of Hitirch properly in thin country.
We prenent the npectaclo to the
world of a country burdened down with
debt,public and private(aiid yet allowing
religion* corporation* to hold :m much as
SO acre* in a great city like New York,
free ofnil taxation. We refer not to Trinity
or St. Paul, lint to an other religion*
corporation wluwe case wan recently
passed upon hy the Supreme Court. The
President estimates that an tiling are going
we nlinll have in the year 11)00 the
incredible ami almost incomprehensible
amount ot Ihrtt thousand million* of dollar*
held dead in the hands of religions corporations.
TIkmc are all the features of tho Message
that we liave space to comment upon
this morning.
Meeting ill UcllHlMirg I.nut Mglit.
Our Wflllsbiirg correspondent sent lis
by last night's late train an interesting
account of the railroad meeting held in
the Court House at that place last night,
which we are obliged to leave out on account
of the President's Message trenching
ho largely on our spaco this morning.
The meeting was addressed hy the Hon.
C. I>. Hubbard, President of the P. W. A
Kir. road, nnd was well attended. Wo
judge by the questions propounded to Mr.
Hubbard that very decided interest is felt
?|? there in the result of to-morrow's
vote. Our correspondent says that the
questions asked were nlily nnswered by
Mr. Hubbard. One of J hem (by Mr. Lawar)
was ns to when, in case, Wellsburg
toted her proposed $10,000, operations
would Ik?commenced. To thin Mr. Hub*
bard replied an follow*: "Wo will pro(tedat
once to make inquiries in regard
to material, It will Ik? necessary to conMilt
with the authorities of llrooko and
Ohio counties in reference to a transfer of
their stock. Everything would be put in
motion as fast as possible,"
Another question : "In case the counties
refuse to transfer their stock, what
then?"
Mr. I Pa answer: "In that event the
present enterprise will stop". This project
wto undertaken on the supposition
that the two counties would transfer their
?tock. As showing this he read the vote
"f Brooke county to that effect. Also
the vote of Ohio county which transfers
conditionally, viz: if the road is put in
running order.
Question: Will this new company be
*nentire new organization?
Answer: Home things had occurred in
the administration .of the old company .
remained as an old sore?which we |
*ould like in a different shape. The new
company propose to go to work on ft different
plan from that of the old one. j
Question: In case of the completion
"I the road who will furnish the rolling
'lock ?
Aftswer: The Pittsburgh, Cincinnati
ft ft. uitil* Company. Agreement read
#ith that company.
Qitftinn: What hanlwen the estimated
po't of Retting the road ready for the
'oiling Htock ?
An?wer: $170,000. Hut my judgment
" that $200,000 will he necennary. An
wtimate hit* been made of $1,000 |?er
'"ile for ropalra to the road-bed. The
balance i? for iron, nwitchen, depot*, Ac.
to when the money would l? called
Mr. Hubbard explained that the
company hoped to get to work early in
he spring?not later than the l?t of
April?provided all the fund* were rained
V that time. The aim in to raine $75,000
jn Wheeling, Wellaburg and alone the
hne, and then to bond the road for
lit),000. tTp to thin time $35,000 ha*
wen Mitocribod here.

A Melancholy AUuiIkmIou.
mi. _ if--.! 1 n, ., i..i II...) 1
i ne JMariiunuurg ouucsinan ieeis cimtru ;
upon to lot the world know that out of j
all the Democratic newspapers in West i
Virginia it alone "demanded in the name 1
of the party" that the charge against the
Auditor and Treasurer should tie 1
"promptly and thoroughly investigated." j
All tho other Democratic newspapers in (
the State "appeared satisfied that the of- (
fences of Burdett and Bennett, an evolved J
from tho testiiuouy before the House Jm- {
peachment Committee, should either be
condoned or glossed over."
But even this lamentable confession is J
not the worjit feature of the case. Worse *
yet remains to be told, and this bold S
Democratic paper lets it out thus: (
"Joined to the fact that the Democratic f
members of the House had no encourage- '
ment for their party papers to investi. t
gate the ollicial mis-conduct of the Auditor
and Treasurer, was the more disre- (
putable conduct of certain Democratic ,
would-1)0 journalistic-leaders who not only
took the vindication of these oflicers .
into their keeping, but by all tho underhand
means known to the lobbv endeavored
to force the delegates of tho people
into a stultification themselves, thus |
bringing reproach upon the fair fame of .
the Commonwealth by whitewashing the
accused. We have tho testimony of ?,
members of the House that they were
subjected to approaches in behalf of the ,
offenders and were shadowed in their
rooms and in going and returning to tho
place of meeting by outsido parties,
who plied them with arguments nud plead ?.
For the abandonment of the investigation.
The very means resorted to by the friends
from the consequences of their miscon* 1
iluct in office, had tho unlooked for effect
of deej>ening the Impression that they
were guilty ?the offences charged against
them. Had they been innocent they
would have demanded a speedy and
thorough investigation. Thus, as it has
i>ften before turned out, the guilty and
lliose who would screen them have but
woven their own toils.
In tho namo of the people wo return
Ihanks to the twenty anil two Democrats of
Ihe House who withstood the wiles of the
lobbies, and who stepped to theaiiont in
/indicating their own and tho State's
fair tame, Dishonesty and ollicial cor*
ruption, as of right it should be, lias bv
their action been declared just as much
in offense when committed by Democratic
jfllce-holders, as if committed by partisan
opponents, and in behalf of the |>cople
they have demanded that the accused, if
found guilty, shall bo visited with certain \
ind adequate punishment.

Editors Intelligencer: a
We were, on the spur of the moment 1
ind without a second thought, somewhat
KlirpriBBU hib uuier <)njr9 in luumug uur
the proceedings of the lower branch of the
Legislature to find that our representative,
the lion.D. 8. Squires, voted agaiiut
the articles of Impeachment, surprised
from the fact that we knew him very well
Mid always supposed him to be, at least n
technically, an honest man, or at all I
avents sufficiently intelligent nnd honest r
to perceive and oppose a palpable and n
clearly defined fraud and scheme.of ras- c
cality: And when, where and how the
Hon.* gentleman will find a Constituency r
(n this countv, even among strong Demo* y
Brats, who will endorse his action on that i
[juestion wo know not: but on the contrary
wo are fully persuaded that he has lj
Hotly violated his trust, if a reflection of fc
the sentiments of his constituents is made |:
the rule of his action or has any influence n
apon his votes. If, however, he is operitlng
merely on "his own iiook wo have 1
nothing further to nay. Any, oven tacit, r
Intimation*, from whatever source, tend- c
ingtoshow that the people of Braxton
county (and we speak without regard to r
political preferences) will endorse the act
ions of official peculators and rogues, we fcombat
and hold oa a misrepresentation ]
of public sentiment; an injustice to the
people nnd totally false. His unwise nnd
paltry vote upon the impeachment
question, is the second error, committed
by the Honorable gentleman, dur- j
Ing his present, brief legislative expo- ?
Hence, which was unnecessray, as his (
vote on the proposed change of the (1
Congressional Districts, was n blunder r
that will consign him to private life for
thejnextscore of years. In some respects,
at least, a striking similarity of motives
snd actions exists between our Delegate '
and the impeachable State Treasurer, as r
both worthies were extreme radicals when J
It suited their convenience to net in that I
capacity. *
Many of us remember when he was "
laboring for tho office of County Superln- 1
v>? o_i?1_ !_ /?i?
irimciu ui rrco ovimuii', in mo h mh^
ilnyH nf registration, that the Hon. Panlol
Stephen Squirt* "out Ileroded Herrxl"
bv taking with impunity anil always P
"strait," the moat searching. scalding and !
heart-rending"test-oaths" tfiat it wim pos- r
lible to And in print; and while thus loyal t
and when acting as a member of the li
Board of Supervisors, he helped to fix his C
nwn salary as County Superintendent of c
Free School* at the enormous sum of |i
MOO per year, which in double the amount t
receive*! by any of libiMtecessoflj recelv- >
ed It too, in the infancy of the system, i
where there was no work to do,no schools I
to visit and no reports to make. Such li
rtre some of the peculiar qualifications
brought to bear in the Iiegislature by our
able and profound representative which,
to a certain extent, accounts for the remarkable
figure he present* In that body 1
and the moulding influence he exerts up- i
an the destinies of the State.
We started out by saying that we were f
surprise*! at the action of our delegate in n
voting as he did, but upon mature reflection
we find that the terra was inanpro* c
priate; a* those votes arestrictlvln keen- q
ing with former official acts and perfectly a

great excitement. A complete

i.day's delay in the sending of the meaage
