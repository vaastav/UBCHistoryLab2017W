CONGRESSIONAL NEWS.
Washington, Dec. 6.—The first reg
ular session of the fifty-fifth congress
assembled at noon. Speaker Reed pre
siding in the house and Vice President
Il> bai t ia the senate. The preliminar
ies were of the usual routine character.
’Die president’s message was read in
both houses and a bill for postal sav
ings banks was among the few
measures iJiescr.ted.
Washington, Dec. 7. —In the sen
ate Mr. Walthall (dem., Miss.) pre
suited the credentials of D. D.
Money of' Mississippi, to succeed the
ato Senator George. Mr. Money was
sworn in. An Interesting contest for
piccedence in the consideration of the
I Lodge immigration bill and the pro-
I peted legislation to confer author
ity upon the president to act for the
'protection of the government’s inter
est at the sale of the Kansas Pacific
then occurred.
Washington, Dec. 7. —The session
of the house witnessed a lively
skirmish over tie question of dis
tributing the president’s message to
the various committees clothed with
jurisdiction over the subjects dealt
with. The conflict Of authority came
between the ways and means commit
tee and the banking and currency
committee. The battle raged all
along the line. During the debate Mr.
Giosvenor (rep., O.) fired the first gun
against the civil service law, and tills
brought the friends and enemies of
that measure Into action. He heartily
agreed with tho president, "that there
were places in the classified service
which ought to be exempt.” "1 am
glad," said Mr. Grosvcnor, “to go that
far with the president, even If I am
compelled to part company with him
when he says the civil service system
has (he official sanction of tho people.”
His remarks In denunciation of “life
tenure In office” were met with up
roarious applause.
Mr. Brasilia, chairman of the com
mittee of civil service, defended the
’law and thought any attempt to legis
late upon tho question must bo re
garded as an Indignity to the execu
tive. Mr. Bailey (dem., Tex.) com
mended Mr. Grosvenor’s utterances
against the building up of an ofllce
boldlng class in this country. Mr.
Johnson (rep., Ind.) in a ringing warn
ing declared that if the bill to emas
culate the civil service law passed it
would meet a presidential veto. Mr.
Grosvenor ho charged with being de
relict to his duty as a republican. That
party, ho said, was unalterably pledged
to support the law. No portion of
the president's message met with more
hearty endorsement from him than
that relating to civil service. More
over ho said it was a mistake to Im
agine that the sentiment of the coun
try was opposed to It. The law is
heartily approved by all except a few
"degenerate politicians” who opposed
it from selfish motives. During tho
progress of tho debate Messrs. Walker
and Johnson consulted with Dlngley
and a modification of the resolution of
distribution was agreed upon. It
gave the ways and means committee
jurisdiction over all matters In the
message relating to "revenue, bonded
debt of the United States and to
Beatles of the United Stales affect
ing revenue.”
Representatives Griffin Introduced
a bill to exempt from homestead entry
120 acres of the land adjoining the
Wisconsin rifle range at Camp Douglas
and turn it over to the state of Wis
consin. The range ribw occupies 400
acres, but additional space is needed
to provide for safety from stray balls.
Washington, Dec. 8. —Mr. Allen
(pop., Nob.,) introduced in the senate
a resolution declaring it to be the
sense of the senate that congress
should with all due convenient speed
acknowledge by appropriate act the
political independence of Cuba. He
followed it with a speech declaring that
the commercial spirit of (he United
States was preventing action. The na
tional bepublican convention had de
clared in favor of the Independence of
Cuba, going further than simple
recognition of belligerency. Ho
thought that the president is under ob
ligations to carry out the pledge which
had been made to 73.000,000 people.
The president. Mr. Allen thought, had
been lulled to sleep by the declaration
of Spain that she would give Cuba
semi-political existence. He expressed
the belief that the president’s neglect
to take such action as would insure
the political Independence of Cuba
was an exhibition of “rank hypocrisy”
and “flagrant neglect of public duty”
which wou'd be corrected by the all
ruling power in its own good time.
Senator Oalllnger introduced a bill
prohibiting the granting of pensions
to widows of soldiers whose marriage
occurred subsequent to the passage of
the bill under which they make their
claim.
Washington. Dec. 8. —The session
of the house lasted only fifteen min
utes. Representative Harney (rep.,
Wls.) introduced two private pension
bills to increase the pension of Col, D.
Vhinney to $45 a month, and to in
crease that of Mert* B. Tschopo to S4O.
Washington, Dec. 9.—ln the senate
Mr, Gallinger (rep., N. H.) chairman
of the committee on pensions, called
attention to the increasing demand
for private pension legislation and re
quested the senators to be careful in
the future to see that their bills for
private pensions were meritorious be
fore they were introduced. He thought
that the practice of pensioning remar
ried widows and several other similar
classes of claimants ought to be stop
pod. An attempt was mode by Mr. Mc-
Bride (rep.. Ore.) to secure an ap
propriation for the relief of Klondike
miners, but the net result was a reso
lution calling on the secretary of war
for all the information that he had on
that subject, A resolution by the
Pacific railroad committee asking for
information regarding the sale of the
Kansas-Pacific was adopted. This gave
Messrs. Gear ,(rep., la.) and Thurston
(rep., Neb.) opportunity for short
speeches congratulating the country
upon the seU.ement of the Pacific
railroad question. Mr. Gear said that
too much credit could not be given the
present administration for the admir
able manner in which It had handled
and disposed of the Pacific railroad
matters. Mr. Thurston congratulated
the country upon the result of the ad
ministration's efforts regarding the
Pacific railroads. He said that If the
plan proposed by Mr. Harris (dem.,
Twin.) had been adopted the United
States would not have received any
thing approximating the magnificent
sum which has been paid for the main
line of the Union Pacific. He said that
he noticed in the president’s message
that the administration Is committed
to a policy of purchasing the Kansas-
Pacific branch unless a better bid is
offered. He did not believe In govern
ment ownership of railroads and he
was of the opinion that the experi
ment of such owi ership, if It was to be
j tried, might better be with some other
than the Kansas-Pacific railroad. He
suggested to the Pacific railroad com
mittee that the authority asked for by
the president to bid In the road be
coupled with full power to re-sell it.
Mr. Hoar (rep., Mass.) presented a
petition signed by 21,269 native Haw
aiians, protesting against the annexa
tion of Hawaii. Adjournment was
taken until Monday.
Washington, Dec. 9.—The house
entered upon a consideration of the
pension appropriation bill and stirred
up a debate that promises to continue
for several days. Several southern
1 democrats offered criticism on various
| classes of pensioners and Private John
| Allen (dem., Miss.), presented a series
|of amendments designed, as he said.
[to correct some of the most glaring
’ °vlls. They prohibit granting pen
sions to widows whose applications
were not filed during their win
and the granting of pensions lo wid
ows whose applications were based on
marriages contracted after the passage
of this act, and to permanently insane
|or idiotic minors who had reached
i their majority. It was admitted on
i both sides of the house during the
| discussion that the $140,000,000 carried
; by tlie bill for pensions would not
cover the expenditures but, as con
giess would be in session, Mr. Cannon
(rep., 111.) said it would be easy to
jmake good any deficiency that might
occur. He gave a detailed statement of
prospective revenues and expendi
tures and pleaded for economy. The
debt for 1898 was put by him at $21,-
000,000 but Mr. Allen (dem„ Miss.)
declared it would be $72,000,000. A
long debate on pensions ensued.
HOW A DEFAULTER WAS CAUGHT.
The fad/ts In the somewhat
extraordinary case of the default
ing American banker Forster, who
was arrested recently, seem to be
these: He absconded from New
York in 1880, carrying with him a sum
of $193,000. The company with whom
ho was employed secured judgment
against him, and a surety company
paid the amount of the defalcation,
taking measures for the culprit’s cap
ture. A detective followed the Napo
leonic thief around the world, and ran
him to ground finally In a London
music hall, where he was discovered
In company with a young and pretty
woman. In order to make no mistake
the detective photographed the couple
by means of a detective camera and
sent proofs of the photo to New York
with descriptions of the man, who was
now living under the name of Warder.
While this was going on the thief
slipped through the detective's lingers.
The New York police then sent photos
of the couple to all the principal de
tective offices of the world, with a
promised reward of $5,000 in case of
arrest. A member of the Paris detec
tive force was one day in a big finan
cial establishment, and thought he
recognized Forster in an elegantly
dressed gentleman who happened to be
there. The detective shadowed his
find. Soon the man was leading about
a dog which the New York and London
police had mentioned as being the de
faulter’s constant companion, it was
at Neuilly that the man had taken up
his residence: his baggage was search
ed, with the result that letters bearing
the name of Forster were found. The
Now York police were advised and
they sent a detective to Paris, who
made the arrest. Forster is now at the
police station awaiting the completion
of the extradition formalities. As to
the reward of $5,000 (25,000 francs) it
will be divided among nil the members
of the Paris detective force—364 per
sons say, about £3 per head. It is a
tradition that the rewards should be
thus distributed. To the very natural
query as to why the reward had not
been given to the man who made the
capture, M. Cochefort, to a press rep
resentative, replied that when a detec
tive arrests a man ho (the detective)
never acts on his own initiative; he is
detailed for the work by a superior.
In order to be entitled to the whole of
the reward he would have to depart
from his instructions, a case which M.
Cochefert adds, “never presents Itself."

• CHRISTMAS WISHES,
Ch. may the little babies all.
Upon this Christmas night,
In hovel, or in castle hall.
Be dimpled with delight:
And may they gently, gently sleep.
Or wake to sweetly smile;
And may the tender Jesus keep
His watch o’er them the while.
May all the little girls and boys
Beneath the heaven’s blue
Have all the imaginable toys,
And cake and candy, too.
God grant, while it is thus so cheap
To fill their lives with light, ,
That never one be made to weep
Upon this Christmas night.
Young men and maids, where’er ye be,
Put on your gay attire.
And may true love and guileless glee
Be all your hearts’ desire.
May all the sweets ye revel in
Be those that never cloy;
And may no shadow of a sin
Lie dark across your joy.
May all stern men and cruel men
Feci some strange gentleness,
May sad men and despairing men
To-night feel hope's caress.
May every mother in the world
Hear good news of her child.
And every weary heart be furled
In Christ’s heart, meek and mild.
And, oh, upon the silvery head
Of age may heaven’s light.
Like sunset’s last bright beams be shed
In holy peace to-night;
May hate and greed, and all that’s
wrong,
Be shamed and smitten when
The choiring angels sing their song
Of “Peace, good will to men.”
—Rev. Dr. Crane.
“Christmas with its pealing bells,
And its appetising smells,
And its mirth compelling Joys,
And its happy girls and boys,
Christmas day has come.”
Thus a nearly starving bard
Wrote to 1111 a Christmas card;
Wrote for half a score of dimes —
What cared he for Christmas chimes;
He, so peaked and glum?
Christmas wouldn’t come for weeks.
And he felt his sunken cheeks.
What, he cried, in accents grim,
What would Christmas bring to him?
Would it might bring death!
Then once more he took his pen
“Christmas-tide has come again;
Christmas with its fog and slush,
Christmas with its cant and gush.”
“That’s the talk,” he saith.
“Too much candy, too much pie;
Tommy got more gifts than I.
Wish old Santy hadn’t come,
'Cause he didn’t bring a drum.”
Thus the verses ran.
“Christmas day and I am broke,
Have to put my hat in soak;
Still I had to give Louise,
Something that was sure to please,
So I bought the fan.”
“And Louise said ‘Stingy thing.
I was sure, he’d send a ring.’ ”
He exposed his fellow men —
This was in July.
That same day he sold the rhymes
To the paper, Christmas Chimes,
And a check did he receive,
For the lines on Christmas eve,
Fairly made him cry.
True, it only happened so,
But it lightened all his woe,
Made him join the shopping throng,
Made him sing his earlier song,
He felt in the swim.
“Christmas with its pealing bells,
And its appetising smells,
And its mirth compelling joys,
A.id its happy girls and boys,
Christmas came to him.
—Charles Battell Loomis.
A SACRED HOUR.
To every man of file higher type
there comes a solemn hour when his'
heart, wrenched but a short while ago
by convulsive agony, turns in sudden
exultation of spirit to virtue. 'The
transition is as strange as that by
which a man passes from one system
of belief to another, or from a high
of all offenses. This solemn hour, in
which virtue is born into life, is the
sweetest ever known to man. He feels
as though the body, with all its weight
