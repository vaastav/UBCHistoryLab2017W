The United States Supreme Court Dis
misses the Appeal
The Probate Court ot Graham County Had the Kiglit
to 'Determine the Question of Custody of the
Children.
Washington, Dec. 3. The supreme
court of the United States dismissed
today, for want of jurisdiction, the
case of the New York Foundling Hospi
pital vs. John C. Gatti. This decision
revives the story of about forty or
phan children sent from New York to
Arizona in 1904, which at that time re
ceived much attention at the hands of
the public. The effect of the decision
hich was determined by Justice Day,
is to leave in effect the decision of the
Arizona superior court, which was fav
orable to Gatti.
The opinion in the rase brought out
the fact that in October 194. a special
car containing forty foundlings from
the hospital, intended for the neigh
lxiring towns of Clifton and Morenii.
Arizona, arrived at the former place.
The children were in charge of three
Sisters of Charity, but were turned
over to the local priest in pursuance
of a request he had made to have the
children sent out. In that request he
had said that respectable, educated
Spanish families desired them for
adoption. They were immediately dis
tributed throughout the two towns,
but instead of giving them to reputable
people, as the priest had promised, the
American residents of the place charg
ed that the recipients were of the low
est class of half breed Mexicans, and
wholly unfit to care for the children
of whom they were to become the fos
ter parents.

They accordingly organized a mass
meeting and appointed a committee to
devise ways and means and the chil
dren were all taken from their guar
dians and adopted by the Americans.
The Arizona courts found much diffi
culty in dealing with the case, but
they sustained the course of the citi
zens and endorsed their retention of the
children. The Sisters of Charity who
hud control of the hospital, sought to
have the little ones restored to their
custody in order that they might take
l them back to New York.
I The case acted on today Involved the
custody of only one child, but it has
been agreed that the decision in this
case should control in all others.
Consequently, all the children will be
left in Arizona.
The decision of the case turned en
tirely on the question as to whether the
personal freedom of the children had
been violated and the court held that
such was not the case.
Sjieaking on that point in the case of
William Norton, one of the children.
: Justice Day said: "There was no at
I tempt to lilt gaily wrest the custody of
I the children from its lawful guardian
j while in Arizona. The society volun
tarily took the child there with inten
I tion that it should remain. Through
' imposition the child was placed In the
custody of those unfit to maintain con
j trol over it. It was within the jurisdic
j tion of the court under the circum
; stances that rival claimants of the
j right of custody might invoke the ju
I risdiution of a court of competent Ju
I risdiction in the territory to determine
; not the right of freedom, but to which
' custody . of a child of tender years
should be submitted."

25 cents, which was unexplained and
undisputed.
The tl rate is the published tariff,
applicable to Pueblo. The smelting
company pays $1 per ton freight on
coke from the Walsenburg, Colorado
district, and while the published tariff
is 12, according to the testimony.
Coal from Canyon City cost the Col
orado Fuel and Iron company 37 cent
per ton while the public pays 75 cents
per ton. The ncminal charge In freight
to the fuel company for certain classes
of coal from the Walsenburg district
is $1.75 per ton, but the revision clerk
of the Rio Grande charges but 56 cents
per ton, was the evidence developed to
day. These damaging admissions were
from a Rio Orande employe who said
that the cut in rates to the smelting
company was made pursuant to a letter
received from Fred Wild Jr., general
freight agent of the road, who made It
clear that the communication was of n
confidential nature. The billing clerk
were not notified of the reduction.
There was no effort on' the part of
the Rio Grande's attorneys present In
court today, to explain those alleged
discriminations.

THE FORT RtNO AFFAIR
RUSHED TO THE FRONT
An Extraordinary Proceeding On the Open
ing Day of the Session
Senators Foraker ami Penrose Present Iiesolution
of Inquiry for Information Ilejrartling tlie Discharge
of the liejjro Battalion.
Washington. Dee. S The fifty-ninth
congress began Its last session at noon
today. It took but fifteen minutes to
arrange the preliminaries. The senate
received from the president a long list
of nominations for its confirmation and
in an executive session of ninety min
utes decided, as the nominations had
been received before the body had been
organized formally, to make no con
firmations until the president's annual
message had been received and the
session had been fairly started.
Senators' Penrose of Pennsylvania
and Foraker of Ohio came forward
with resolutions of Inquiry regarding
the discharge of the negro troops ot
the Twenty-fifth Infantry. One waa
addiessed to the president and the
other to the secretary of war. After
the ripple of surprise had passed and
Vice President Fairbanks had sug
gested that it was unusual to tran
sact any business until the president's
message had been received the reso
lutions went over by unanimous con
sent. Senator Dupont of Deleware took the
oath of office. The opening of the two
houses was witnessed by an animated
thiong which filled the galleries to their
capacity. Hundreds went away disap
pointed In not gaining admittance to
witness the session of either senate or
house.
Not in years has a larger number of
members elect of the lower house of
congress presented themselves at the
speakers' deskjo take the oath of office.
Death has been unusually active
among the membership during the
closing days of the last session and the
beginning of the present, and Chaplain
Couden feelingly called the attention of
the body to the work of the grim reap
er during the months since adjourn
ment. Speaker Cannon appointed Jas. R,
Mann of II II note as a member of the
hoard of regents of the Smithsonian
Institution, vice Robert R. Hitt, de
ceased. The galleries of the house were
crowded at an early hour. The collec
tion of flowers on the desks of mem
bers was much commented on but the
order of the speaker prohibiting the
floral display w-as generally commend
ed for Its good sense. A similar rule
was made in the senate two years ago.
Mrs. Nicholas Long-worth, daughter
of the president, occupied a seat in the
executive gallery, accompanied by Miss
Hagner, social secretary of the wife of
the president.
The routine work of the house Inci
dent to the opening day .was quickly
dispatched, the roll call showing nearly
300 members present.
Representative Bourke Cochran of
New York who recently married Miss
Ide. was the subject of hearty laughter
when his personal request that he be
permitted to absent himself for an In
definite period on account of business
was laid before the house by the speak
er. After the appointment of the usual
committee to wait upon the president
and Inform him that the house was or
ganized and ready to receive any com
munication he might desire to make of
