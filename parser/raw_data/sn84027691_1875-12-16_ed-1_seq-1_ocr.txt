A EEK ABEABLE MESSAGE
Pcsident Grant's message is a meat le
inarkable political document. Evidently
great care has been bestowed upon its prep
ara.Ion, and the President has made him
self thoroughly acquainted with every toj
ic lie discu-ses. Hie views on the public
school question meet with the approval of
Protestant, Catholic, Jew and ragan, and
will convince chronic disturbers that the
common school system, which has done so
much to educate the masses and build up
the country, must and eball be preserved.
The President is equally firm and delei
mined in hi opposition to tl'e unl-o'y and
i'Scgal practices of Brigham Yodfig and
his followers. Polygamy is a disgrace to
our country, and a crime which should be
severely punished.
The President's manly Ftand on the Cu
ban question, the taxation of all property,
and the imortation of Chinee women for
sinful pnr;j--es, will also be approved by
the great mass of the people. U. S.
Grant aiways wrile3 a message which com
mands attention and respect.
COMMENTS OF THE PEES3
The newspapers of the Missouri Y rll
yesterday morning, did not extensively
comment on the message, it not being re
ceived until a very late hour.
The Si. Joseph Herald, Kepuhlican, says:
"It is an able and exhaustive document,
and as the various questions discussed are
of vital importance to the country, it will
be read with great interest by all. To thoe
who are awaiting with confidence the dread
ful apparition of CarearUra, the message
w ill prove a signal disappointment. By the
thoughtful and dispassionate, it will be
deemed an able review of the important
questions to which it is his duty as Giief
Executive, to direct the attention of Con
gress." The St. Joseph Gazette, Democratic, says:
"The President's message, which we. lay
before our readers to-day, will doubtless
command more attention than any similar
document that has hitherto been written by
Mr. Grant. Evidently, the state pajer has
been prepared with more than usual care."
The Lawrence Journal, Republican, says:
"This message will be widely read and will
produce a profound impression. It carries
with it a style of eotscious power, a
knowledge of the people and of the ques
tions uppermost in their minds, and a skill
in stating and meeting thoe ques-:ons
which few of our public men can equal in
their happie.it or profoundest moods.'1
The Lawrence Tribune, Independent, says:
"We have had little time to even scan its
recommendation. It is, however, a con
servative and plainly-worded, straightfor
ward document, and will commend jt"elf to
the careful attention of the reader."
The Atchison Champion, Republican, has
no editorial on the subject.
The Topeka Gmmontreallh, Republican,
say: The message is briefly summarized
in the lat paragraph, which summary we
commend to those styled by the President
"the right-thinking and patriotic citizens
of the United State?.' We think, more
over, that the roeagc as a whole will suit
that clas of jTople."'
The Kansas City Journal, Republican,
says; "It is altogether the tnol interest
ing and imprersivc utterance that has yet
emanated from President Grant, and as ad
elrenscd to the opening ssssion of the Forty
fourth Congress, and upon the eve of anoth
er Presidential canva, will lie read with
uuirersal interei-t and elicit widespread and
exciting conimen.."
The Kansas City Time, Democratic, pays
a high compliment to the message, by se
verely criticizing it from a partisan stand
jioint. The President's utterances hurt the
opposition.
The Chicago Tribune, Republican, 6ays :
"A careful reading of the message seems to
justify the expectation that has been made,
and a pretense of serious dk-apointment in
any quarter will lie captious, partisan and
unreasonable, It may be said in general
terms that it takes a brod, comprehensive,
national and statesmanlike view of the
subjects it treats, and nowhere degenerates
into the spirit of mere partyim. Its tone
is essentially patriotic, without once aban
doning that moderation which should
characterize self government, and the swell
ing pride of a review of a century's progress
unparalleled in the history of nations is
tempered by a timely warning against the
dangers that threaten the Republic"
The St. Louis Globe-Democrat, Republican,
remarks : "Though long,! is not dull, but
is so full of matter and interest, that his
successor need hardly expect to do as well,
and if the recommendations contained in
it are carried out, the last year of Grant's
administration will be the most brillianf
in our national history. But whatever the
legislation which shall result therefrom,
the message will stand conspicuous not
only for that plain, common-sen which
has always distinguished his Excellency,
but forabreadlhof scope, a depth of in
sight, a statesmanlike grasp, and treatment
of great subjects which will lie admit.ed
even by his most determined opponents.
The St. Louis Times, Democratic, obser
ves: "On the whole, this ionderous docu
ment reads moderately well, and is only
obe:tionable in spots."
The Atchison Champion, Republican,
ays: "The seventh annusl menage of
President Grtnt was laid before the read
ers of the Champion, in full, yesterday morn
ing. It has been read, we believe, with
general satisfaction and approval. The
most lengihy message the President has
ever transmitted to Congress, it is also, we
think, the best Its recommendations are
wise and statesmanlike, its tone is frank,
honest and dignified, and its statement of
the condition of our demestic and foreign
relations is clear and satisfactory."
The Council Bluffs XonpareV, Republi
can, says : " The document, as all who
hare perused it with any degree of care and
fair-mindedness, will agree, is a practical,
straight-forward, business-like affair, emi
nently characteristic of the man and the
times."
BEPOBTOF THE 8ECBETABY OF THE
KAVY.
A more peaceful document than the re
port of the Secretary of the Navy it would
be difficult to compose on a subject prima
facie so warlike. It consists mainly of a
matter-of-fact description of the Navr, its
condi-ion and capacity. Iu operations' are
also detailed, but they are of the most qui
et nature. A couple of vessels dropped in
at Tripoli last August to exact an apology
for insults offered an American official by
some Tripolitan seamen. Once or twice in
the course of the year Bear-Admiral ilul
lany, of the North Atlantic Squadron, has
"assisted" at a Central American revolu
tion, keeping an eye on American inter
ests and the isthmus railroad. And once
a Commander wag directed to stop at
the Samoan Isles to give the natives a
: - ' - y. - -
brief cour-e of instruction in civ
ilized deportment toward citizens
of the United States. This Lj about the ex
tent to which our navy hag been required
to intervene jn our relations with other
governments. Besides this service, it has
contributed its part toward the ob-ervation
ol the transit of Venus, has made import
ant deep-sea soundings in the Pacific, and
examined carefully the route of the Cali
fornia steamers; it has determined accu
rately the geographic position of a number
of points in the West Indies, and has aided
in the exploration of routes for canal navi
gation ac:os the Isthmus of Panama. Its
scientific labors have been interesting and
valuable, but not so extensive as was desir
able, and might have been practicable, had
not the limits of the appropriations been so
soon reached.
A ELEEL CHOWS
No one was able to get a nomination
from the Democratic caucus held on Sat
urday last who could not show a clear rec
ord in favor of the rebellion. The Speaker
and the Sergeant-at-Arms, the only North
ern men cho-en, were both Northern men
with Southern principles, as well during as
after the war, and both were chon be
cause of their well-known sub-erviency to
the South. The Clerk is a notorious Ken
tucky rebel ; the Doorkeeper wan former
ly Doorkeeper of the Confederate Congress ;
the Postmaster was a rebel, driven out of
the Alexandria po-l-office for his disloyal
ty, and the Chaplain was exiled from Con
necticut to Washington, because he persist
ed in giving aid and comfort to the rebels
during the war.
These are not accidental happenings.
The men referred to were chosen for thee
places solely because of their rebel record.
The Chsplainship, we are told, in the his
tory of the caucus proceeding", was given
to the successful candidate after a speech
by Mr. Barnum, stating why Connecticut
grew too hot for his continued residence
there. Tltol settled the contest in his favor.
To have been a rebel, or a friend of the re
bellion, was essential to the success of any
one, in that caucus.
THE FIEST SUCCESS.
The first day's cession of the Democratic
House of Representatives witnessed a sharp
and exciting contest on the Louisiana ques
tion a contest in which superior political
acumen and parliamentary skill carried the
day as against the advantage of numbers.
It was Fernando Wood's first effort to seize
the Democratic leadership, and in the out
come that gentleman's pretensions were ef
fectively disposed of by the promptness and
energy with which ex-Speaker Blaine, sec
onded by Mr. Wheeler, of New York,
threw himself into the breach and defeated
tbc attempt to once more tear open the
Louisiana question. Mr. Blaine's success
was brilliant and complete, though it was
not complete 1 until Lamar and Cox had
committed the serious blunder of siding
with Wood and sharing in the -humiliation
of his failure. It was a pretty fight, and
handsomely won. It looks as though the
minority, led by Mr. Blaine, will be able to
carry their joint every time, against the
wishes of a large majority, under poor lead
ership. .
BEPOST OF THE EECSJ TAET 07 WAB
Tiic report of the Secretary of War states
that the morals of the army is excellent;
that a better class of recruits are enlisted;
that the system of graded comjtensation
and savings deposit at interest, lately insti
tuted, works very well; that more military
bandi are needed ; that the officers should
be required to keep a historical record of
the posts in their command ; that the law
should bj more stringent against the enlist
ment of married men ; that the coast sur
vey in the interest of Ead's jetty at the
mouth of the Mississippi has begun;
that the entire army is now supplied with
new rilles and carbines of No. Ao calibre,
and tha' there is a reserve supply of about
-o,000 o; the new and improved aims; that
the Academy at West Point still vindicates
its efficiency and tiermancni utility, etc.,
etc
BEWAEE OF HIM
A lelter has U-en addressed to the New
Yoik Givptu; signed by one '"Father J. V.
McXaniara," calling for a general gather
ing of Irishmen from all parts of the coun
try, in Philadelphia during the Centennial
elebration, not only to participate therein,
but to council together in regard to the pro
posed revolution in their native land. If
this gentleman and the "Father McNani
ara" at the head of that secret revolution
ary society which was exposed in New
York a short time ago, are one and the
same person, it would be well for the Irish
men to be very cautious in4regard to acting
under his leadership.
BEGISTEB OF THE SALISA LAND OFFICE
The editorof the Salina Herald this week
publishes over one column of extracts ta
ken from State exchanges, speaking in com
plimentary terms of Mr. B. J. F. Hanna,
for Register of the Salina Land Office. No
gentleman in the State is more modest cr
retiring, and none more deserving of a
good office. If his brethren of the press
can aid him, Mr. Hanna is sure of the ap
pointment, as the Junction City Union, To
peka Commonvcalth, Sumner County Irett,
Abilene Chronicle, Osborne County Farmer,
Wyandotte Gaulie, Oskaloosa Independent,
Hays Sentinel, Waierville Telegraph, Man
hattan SationaluJ, Solomon GczeUe and
Leavenworth Times, have all strongly en
dorsed him.
A CHANGE
The Atchison Patriot has changed hands.
Mr. Nelson Abbott retires, and is succeeded
by Messrs. Park, Vandegrift and Peters.
The Pairiet i much improved in appear
ance, but politically is as unclean as ever.
The Champion compliments the new firm,
and assures it that there is room for two
daily papers at Atchison. We trust that
the Patriot will succeed.
TAXATIOH OF CHTJBCH PBOPEBTY.
Editor Times: Since we, who warmly
cherish equal rights or genuine Republi
canism, have been greatly surprised to find
in our President's message the recommend
ing, as a matter of justice, the taxation of
ecclesiastical property with other estate,
corporate and private; since by such a rec
ommendation, legislators, not only in
Washington, but Congressmen in every
State that has not already amended by
striking off this exemption clause, can no
longer overlook this question, it may be in
order to state for the information of- Leav
enworth citizens that this exemption of
church property from taxation, coU every
city tax-payer the sum of four mills for
every dollar of tax assessed valuation
that is, were church property taxed the
same as other property, our city tax charge
would be four mills lighter; county and
State tax would also be reduced in propor
tion. Anyone who may doubt this can easily
find it to be the fact by consulting the pub
lished and booked statistical figures.
Yet here we are, as a nation, within but
a lew months of our century" birthday,
aad haveCthroagh all the past yean, been
.' - vg'. - .y.TAj.
boasting that our constitutional form of
government realized to American citizens
equal rights, and it seems to have taken
the kick direct of these oppressive time, to
open our eyes to the fact that we are not j
emancipated from the thrall of those old I
ill-governing monarchial theocracies, tho-e
um xasnioneu insuiuttous iiuui huiui, h
may be said, Americanism in protest
sprang. By such protest, as a nation, did
we not enter upon the arena of the world's
nations, the special champion of free and
equal rights? Is it not fitting, then, that
we start into our second century in a mare
consistent shape?
The principle assumed in such a recom
mendation as this of taxing church holdings
the same as other property which now bears
t e State expense alone, the principle being
that of a more perfect justice realized, will
involve, as well, all exemptions outside of
State and municipal contiol, to-wit : that
of science, the literary, educational, benevo
lent an 1 charitable institutions, saving, per
haps, that of reserve to each family, (see
Kansas State Constitution), in whatever
State such reservations are made. If such
reservations are errors in our professed gov
ernmental order, may they all be held to
aciuunt, and the coast cleared by one
move? The sooner the better. X.
0U2 BEPBESEHTATIVES AT WOBK
A Correspondent writing to the Wichita
Eayle from Washington, speaks highly of
Senator Ingalls. He writes, as an index of the
standing of Senator Ingalls in the National
capital, that "lie had not been in Washing
ton more than half an hour before the news
was spread over the city and at the Depart
ineats, that Senator Ingalls, from Kansas,
had arrived, in him Kansas ha a repre-
sentative possessing ability and influence.
The correspondent also says that Con
gressman Wni. A. Phillips, from the First
district, is at the capital. He and Senator
Ingalls aie both busy looking after the in
terest, of their constituents. Alex. Banks,
for years Chief Clerk of the Kansas House
of Representatives, is now private secretary
to Senator Ingalls, and chief clerk of the
committee on pension', of which the Sena
tor is chairman.
WHAT IS THE KATTEB 1
The Leavenworth Times is continually
finding fault with Kansas people for pat
ronizing Kansas City, but if we tell Platte
cotintians to trade at home and let Leaven
worth alone, the boot is on the other leg,
and The Times don't seem to think that
the sauce that sids the goose to materially
will add anything to the excellencies of the
gander. You know, Colonel, there are times
when an editor, as well as a minister, could
benefit himself by following his own ad
vice. Westcn ComzierciaL
Last week the Ccrnimercieu" endeavored to
prejudice Platte countians against our city,
by te'Iingits readeia that a Platte county
firm was not fairly treated by the Peniten
tiary Board of Directors. We answered
the Commercial, showing it that that there
was only one Leavenworth man on the
Board, Mr. Gillett, and tlie Commercial it
self admits that he voted in fav,r of the
Platte county mill. The Commercial must
rerrcnibtr that Leavenworth and Platte
county have interests in common, while
tlte great Slate of Kansjs. and Kansas City
have none. Kansas City absorbs our
wealth and offers us nothing in return.
Leavenworth merchants have always treat
ed their Missouri friends well, and have
enjoyed the friendship and good will of
the Platte City and Plattsburg papcis.
What nils the Commercial !
Mr. Kerr, tue ntw Speakc-, is a tall,
stately man, more than six feet in height,
broad-shouldered, with a head well poised,
a full growth of brown hair, and eyes that
seem to read you through at a glance. His
scholarship is of the highest o.der; books
are his dealest companions, and his judg
ment of men is keen and discriminating.
The man is wholly practical. There is no
element of humor or romance about him,
and his manners are dignified almost to au
sterity. He is 47 years old.
Georgia is gradually filling up with cot
ton factories, which continue to arise oc
every hand. The Memphis Amlanche, in
noticing the latest enterprise of this kind,
predicts that the time is not far distant
when a very large proportion of the cotton
grown in the South will be manufactured
at home, not only for domestic supply, but
for export.
The Democrats of other States waver, but
those of Kentucky remain tiue and stead
fast in their allegiance to the ancient faith.
Some of the farmers of that State are sell
ing their entire corn crops to distillers, to
be paid for in whisky.

may we ask who appoints the Secretary of
the Tieasury, and sustains him in his

Ir is reported that the Grangers of the
Northwest, at a recent meeting in Chicago,
resolved to nominate a candidate for Presi
dent. This is in violation of the principles
of the order.
It will be seen by his communication that
our Winfield correspondent intends, in his
next letter to The Times, to discuss the
Herd Law. His views will be worthy of
confident ion.
Ix place of being ?200,000,000, as some
placed it, the late William B. Astor'a es
tate is computed by the New York Herald
to figure up not more than S43,OO0,O0O in
value.
"Whek Henry Wilson made shoes, we
learn from the Boston Traveller, he was the
most expert workman at Natick. This was
practical ambition beginning at the com
mencement, and it always wins.
Glekdenxixo, sometimes known as the
New Jersey Beechcr, the alleged seducer of
Mary Pomeroy, is now pastor of a parish in
Henry, Illinois, and is said to be preaching
acceptably to large congregations.
Cardisal McCloskey reports the Pope
as hale and hearty. He says that when
they were walking together in the Vatican
gardens, it was himself whom weariness first
compelled to suggest sitting down.

heterophemy and drop the subject if he'll
let you.
MON-cox D. Coxway agrees with Spur
geon in declaring that Moody and Saokey's
work in Eogland has left no permanent re
sults. The President's message meets with the
endorsement of all honest, fair-minded citi
zens.
The election of Kerr for Speaker, instead
of Randall, is a set back to Tom Scoll'a

EorroK Times : Looking to the future
prospects of Leavenworth, and considering
the necessary adjuncts in acceleration of
her prosperity, 1 desire to impress on the
mind of her citizens, the first great work
to be accomplished. Since it is settled
that the government chiefs will neither go
sneoks in stealing the Fort reservation, nor
sutler others to do it, a united effort should
be pursued and maintained to effect the re
moval of the bridge to the spot opposite
the centre of the city, where it should have
been built in the first place. Whether it
can ever be done, I know not, but a contin
ued effort should be made for it, and it
might induce its accomplishment. It cer
tainly docs not take a prophet to foresee
the magical tendency to the welfare of the
city, such removal would inaugurate. Kan
aa City has found in Kansas her biggest
teats; the removal of the Leavenworth
bridge, with three good thoroughfares, (one
from the northeast, one from the southeast,
and one from the east) through the river
bottom, converging at the east approach to
the bridge, would soon relieve Leaven
worth of her bottle, and substitute a teat,
whose nourishment would expand her
growth to plethoric propoitiona.
Leavenworth always has this advantage:
Her natural location; her healthful atmos
phere ; her landscape scenery on every hand;
all, are unsurpassed. Nature has done her
part welL Now man, do yours.
Among the many pleasant hours spent in
Leavenworth on my recent visit, was a Sun
day evening spent at Occidental Hall. 1
had never heard Brother Sanborn preach
had only heard of him. My friend H., whom
knew to be a Free CongregationalLst, had
been telling me his views of God. He said
that God was everything, and everything a
part of God. That Brother Sanborn be
lieved so too. Well, said I. what part of
uou ao tnose ebony colored cyprtans in the
neighborhood of the gas works constitute ?
Me blowed his nose, complained of a bad
cold, started to look up a iax title, and said
that Bro. Sanborn was a great man, and
that I ought to hear him. I thought the
same, and went to hear him as already
stated. I found Occidental Hall brilliant
ly lighted, comfortably warmed, and alto
gether a delightfully pleasant place. On
looking over the audience after iu make up,
I confess, to an agreeable surprise, I found
the bulk of the elite of Leavenworth society
there; besides an undue proportion ol ber
rriiposisihle mid intelligent men, including
the prominent editors and lawyers. 1 think
that I have never seen, together, a more re
spectable audience. Brother Sanborn, with
the quiet ease of a courtier, glides about, in
social converse with his parishioners, and
finally steps into his desk. The choir,
which seemed to be an amateur quartette,
dUcourt-ed, with the aid of the organ, de
licious naui-ic.
The speaker's subject was the Bible. His
opinion of it, to be brief, was that it is i.o
revelation from God, and its authors no
more inspired than Mohammed, or Saint
Sakva. i hat what is good in it should be
trcaiured, and what is bad, (and there was
much of it,) should be ec!.t.wed. Now,
let me ak, to what does this tent! ? The
ternion was elegantly worded, eloquent!)
spoken, an intelkctual treat. But to what
end is this doctrine ? One intent is, of
course, to urderniine and destroy the
Christian religion. And this is all right,
provided an exchange is ottered which will
better the condition of mankind. If an in
habitant of an inho-pitable clime tear
down hi" hou;c, before he has a better one
prepared, thtriby exposing his family to
disease and death, he is a cruel and wicked
sinner. I have an aged mother who is a
sincere and coriM.-tent Christian, beloved by
every human being who kr.ow.4 her, for her
Christian charities. .chc is not a Pantheist
like Bro. Sanborn, but believes, with an
unbounded faith, that the ill rce God in
His per-on, and hopes to meet her earthly
friends in HLs presence, alter this life.
This belief may appear simple and absurd
to the Pantheist, but, unless I were prt-
fiared to furnL'h, in exchange, a trut:er,
lappier, and more cheerful faith, I would
sooner suffer martyrdom, than I would at
tempt to destroy the sublime fai'It of my
mother in the Christian religion.
But I have neither desire, nor intention
of doing Bro. Sanborn any injustice. I am
always open o conviction, and if his pam
phlet of sermons, soon to be issued, con
tains his doctrine, (not simply that which
destroys the Christian religion, but that
which constitutes, in full, hi own faith), I
hope to have the good fortune to obtain
one, and if I find in it a thesis better cal
culated to benefit mankind, by making us
better and happier, than the doctrines of
Christ, I shall at once embrace it.
As the Herd Law question is a'niming
considerable importance, in view of the ap
proaching Legislature, I shall take the lib
erty to discuss the subject in my next com
munication. J. M. A.
Kansas Interests
Kansas wool is shipped to Boston, made
into cloth and resbipped to Kansas, our
people paying the freight both ways. The
wool-growers receive less per pound than is
paid to Ohio or Pennsylvania wool-growers
for the same grades, simply because the cost
of freight is greater from Kansas tq Boston
than from Ohio or Pennsylvania. If Kan
sas wools were manufactured into cloth here.
all this loss would be saved to our people,
our fa. men would not have to pay for ship
ping so much grain out of the State, the op
eratives would be brought here, and the
money now sent to the Elst, and which
goes to build up Eastern cities ami enrich
Eastern capitalists, would be saved to our
own citizens. And so of other branches of
manufacturing industry, such as the pro
duction of reapers, mowers, rakes, plows,
stoves, household furniture, paper, glasi,
crockery, glass, etc eta, all of which can
be produced as cheaply in Kansas as else
where. But as long as we send our money
out of the State for the purchase of these
articles, to the amount ot, say, a million
dollars per year, we may expect businers to
be dull, and our farmers compelled to mort
gage their farms to keep their heads above
water until the sheriff sell them out.
The cheese that we place upon our tables
is imported fromNew York or Ohio ; the
salt we use is freighted from Ohio, Michi
gan and New York ; even the ax halves,
and broom handles, if not the brooms also,
are made in the East. The money for all
these leaves our State, and our people are,
through their own rhort-eightedness, pay
ing a heavy tribute to eastern capitalists.
Until Kansas enters more extensively into
the production of manufactured articles she
must continue to pay high rates of interest
for money, and receive less for the pro
ductions of her rich soil, than the eastern
States. Her coal fields, water-powers,
central position, and all her natural
advantages and resources fit her for a great
manufacturing as well as an agricultural
State. From the days of Adam Smith,
author of the 'Wealth of Nations," down
to the time of Horace Greeley, author cf
"Essays Designed to Elucidate the Science
of Political Economy," political econo
mists have been unammou in saying that
a people who produce witm.t themselves
all the r.ecessarries as well as luxuries of
civilized life ; a people who save the pro
ds of their own labor, must be vastly
more independent and wealthy than a peo
ple who pay heavy tribute to others who
produce the article of commerce, of trade
and exchange. Toptla Times.

Capture of thu Murderer, Who

The boJy of the peddler, Henry Hu-ell,
was brought into the city yesterday morn
ing about half pa: five o'clock, by Mr.
Wendell Hund, who went out after it the
day before. The corpse wa-s taken to the
late residence of the dead man, near the
vinegar factory, in West Leavenworth,
where his family, a wife and two children,
live at the prevent time. They are in very
destitute circumitances, the husband and
father having been their sole support. The

BL'sgrXI.'s) MURDERER
is a boy fifteen years of age, named Sam
uel Beard. When he was taken to jail he
was recognized by a colored boy, who said
he had been in jail with hini'in Leaven
worth. This statement will, however, have
to be taken for what it is worth. Beard had
been riding with Ruvell all day, ami
when night came, camped with him by the
creek. Here, it is thought, a dispute arose
in regard to some mer.ey which ISeardowed
Kuasell, for a pair of boots, a cap and a
vest, which the boy had bought of him.
The place of encampment was in a small
canon, with high earthen banks on either
side. Beard, after the quarrel, probably
Ufl Mr. Kussell, and afterward returned,
and, looking down from the high, over
hanging bank, fired Umn his victim.
Kusell was evidently killed while
eatixg sltper,
as a trail of blood was discovered leading
from tbe wagon across tha creek, and then
back again to the wagon, while ou the
other side of the creek from the camp,
and where the body wa found, was a piece
of pie, with a few bites taken out of it, and
which the wounded man had thrown down
in his agony. It is supposs.-d that as soon as
he was shot he rose and ran across the
creek and then turned around and
came back again. The bullet, which wa
a large one, entered the right side of the
neck just below the ear, passed entirely
through the body, and was extracted Irom
below the abdomen, on the left side.
Several perin parsed by the scene of the
murder during the day, and saw
RCS.SEIX I.YIMJ DEAD,
but supposing him to be either asleep or
drunk, paid no particular attention to him.
Several school children a!-o saw him
lying there. The apples in a barrel
in the wagon were frozen, and the
other contents of the wagon
were undisturbed, showing plainly that
robbery was not the intention of the as
sassin. The effects of Kn-ell have U-en
brought to this city. The bor-cs attached
to the wagon were the proitTty of Mr.
Wendell llur.d.
After the shooting Beard ran away, and
soon after hired out at a saw mill not far
from the place. When the cornnerV jurj
was sitting on the body, smite one remem
bering that Beard had beiuseen riding with
Bus II on Monday, suggested that he Ix
summoned as a witnes in the caM-, and ac
cordingly he was sent for.
He appeard very reluclant, but
was finally induced to go. When before
the jurv, his statements were so contradic
tory that strong su-picioni were entertained
toward him, ami he was questioned still
more closely. Finally he wa. told that the
family of the dead man would arrhe soon,
and he would lie required to se them. At
ihi stage of aflatr", he broke down com
pletcly, Imr-t into tear, and confe-eI the
crime. When interrogated as to where hi-i
pistol wj, he replied that he had given it
to a man, together with his dirk, to keep
for him. The revolver was Hulreqnently
recovered, and the chambers found to cor-re-qxnd
exactly with the size of the ball
extracted from the torp-s: Two chambers
of the revolver were empty. I!eartl wa
then placed in jiil and held to await his
preliminary examination, which be waived.
TIIC MURDERER,
Samuel Beard, is but fifteen years of age,
and certainly has the appearame of any
thing but that of a murderer. For some
time past he has been working for Mr.
Whitlock, who owns a farm in Salt Creek,
on the Fort I eavenorth and Kickaioo
rod. His parents reside in Wabash, 111.
He carried with him a bowie knife, ordirfc,
and a pistol, but for what purpo-e cannot
be conceived, the murder wa evidently
the result of an outburst of passion.
Mr. Bussell formerly came from DeGrafT,
Logan county. Ohio, where, with his fath
er, he was engaged in an exten-ive dry
goods business. The firm also had a branch
houe in the town of Quincr, a few miles
from De Grain At that time Mr. Kikx-II
was reputed to be worth at least 100,000.
Failing in business he entered the army
a private soldier at the breaking out of the
war, and afterwards came to Kan's. lie
was a man of good education, but since his
failure in business had reen very down

to De Graff, where his mother now reside,
by friend', as he left nothing.

HON. MATT. H. CABPEJITES-
An Open letter to the Editor of the Chica
go Tribune-
You have seen fit to charge in substance"
or publi-h communication which in sub
stance charges me, with having been a
member or organizer ef, or connected with,
what you choos to denominate the Whis
ky Ring in Milwaukee; by which your
readers will understand, as yo'i tutetut they
shall, that I was, while a Senator, a sharer
in the fruit of frauds upon the Internal
Revenue laws of the I'nited States.
I am now very much engaged in attend
ing to the rights cf clients in the United
States Courts here; but as soon as I can
get tbe necessary leisure, which I hope will
be within a few weeks, I will sue you for li
bel, and thus afford you a fair opportunity
to prove votir charges, if you can.
If your charge- are true, I am a disgraced
man; if not, yr.u arc; anil which is the
vidian we will submit to the determina
tion of a jury, where the difference between
truth and falsehood is recognized. It you
can establish my guilt, I ought to be dis
graced and am willing to lie; if you can
not, vim might to to, however unwilling
vou may be.
1 will not take you to Washington, nor
Nova Scotia, nor Cuba, nor Cheyenne, un
der the Poland gag law, but will sue yon
in the United State Circuit Court for the
Northern District of Illinois; and you may
as well lie colh'Cting your evidence upon
the subject.
Matt. If. O.ti: pent at.
T tie Klitor J Vluoi'jo lueiiiwj Jnunud;
You charge me in your pajierof Decem
Iier 1, with having acted a attorney for
the whisky ring during my Senatorial term,
and say I had no right to di so.
I am exceedingly lmy at present, but as
soon as I ran find time, I will ail.ird you
an op)Hirti!nity to prove your charge, ami
if you do so, 1 shall submit to your con
clusion that I did wrong. Yours truly,
M vrr. II. CnrEXTER.

fested a di'iHifiitiim to intrude question of
a political nature for consideration, but a
calm judgment prevailed, which prevented
the (irange from striking the rock which is
the most dangerous ols-tacle in its way to
success. On the whole, we conclude that
the action of the body has been conserva
tive, and devoted much more largely ta a
consideration of the agricultural interests
of the country than to the ixjlitical ques
tions of the hour which divide public opin
ion. Much lime was doubtless waited in
u-c!es.s di-cussion, but for an organization
ct in its infancy, the proceeding were
neen-ssarily devoted to small detail, ami

well employed in a discussion of the bet
means of correcting evils, as in the adop

Junrnnl. A Young Laly Falls Scad While Dancing.
A sad affair occuned last evening at a
party of merry-makers, which will never
be forgotten by those who were witncssc.
A party of young ladies and gents, number
ing about forty louples, held a sociable in
Pythian Hall, which is located in Stebbins'
block, in the square, last evening, anil, as
usual on such occasions, were having a
merry time. None were enjoying thomselves
more or had a lighter l.eaitthan Miss Wil
hclmina Townsend. She had during the
evening danced several times, and it was
when she was dancing the dizzy waltz, af
ter having passed around tbe hall a few
times, that she suddenly fell from the arms
of her partner, on to a settee, a cori. At
first it was suppo-ed she had only fainted,
but ii I'm examination it was found that
the pulsations of the heart bad ceased, and
life had taken a sudden flight. Medical
aid was at once summoned, but too late, for
she had already passed fieyond wedic.il
skill. Her lather, was present, atonee con
vex eil the body to bis home, which is at
No. 6-3 Fourth street, ir-hn was a little more
than sixteen years old. The physicians
who were summoned pronounced it a ca
of heart di-ea?e.
The event so worked upon the nerves of
another one of the dancers named Sarah
Polland, that she swooned, and was taken
to the jii!ite station and placed upon a cot,
where she laid in a death-like stupor for
rearly fro hours, at the end of which time
it was deemed l-st to convey ber to her
Iiome, No. 01 Williams street, she then
showing bnt slight symptoms of returning
to her former self.
The sad event cat a sudden gloom over
the dancers, and they immediately dispers
ed to their home", saddened and deeply
impreed with the awful termination of
their fetivitie. Ilofton Journal.

half an hoar, Ilung the cards down, and
said :
"Mother don't want that kind "he's got
five or six packs ii 'he hoit; now. She
wants some with marked back", so she can
