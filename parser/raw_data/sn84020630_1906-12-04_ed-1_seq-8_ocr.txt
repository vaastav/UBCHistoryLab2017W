Ins.
Cuba.
Last August an insurrection ibroke
out In Cuba which It speedily grew
evident that the existing Cuban! Gov
ernment was powerless to quell. IThls
Government was repeatedly aslqd by
tlie then Cuban Government to Inter
vene, and finally was notified by the
President of Cuba that he Intendejd to
resign; that his decision was Irrevo
cable; that none of the other constitu
tional officers would consent to carry
on the Government, and that he as
powerless to maintain order. It was
evident that chaos was impending,
and there was every probability that
If steps were not Immediately taken
by this Government to try to restore
order, the representatives of various
European tuitions in the island would
apply to their respective governments
fur armed Intervention In order to pro
tect the lives and property of their cit
izens, Thanks to the preparedness of
our Navy, I was able Immediately to
send enough ships to Cuba to pre
vent the situation from becoming
hopeless; and I furthermore -"dispatched
to Cuba the Secretary of War
and the Assistant Secretary of State,
in order that they might grapple with
the situation on the ground. All ef
forts to secure an agreement between
the contending factions, by which they
should themselves come to an arnica
me uiiaersuimung and settle upon
some modus Vivendi some provision
1 government of their own failed,
Finally the President of the Republic
resigned. The quorum of Congress
assembled failed by deliberate pur
pose of its members, so that there
was no power to act on his resigna
tion, and the Government came to a
halt. In accordance with the so-called
Piatt amendment, which vas embod
led in the constitution of Cuba. 1
thereupon proclaimed a provisional
government for the Island, the Secre
tary of War acting as provisional gov
ernor until he could be replaced by
Mr. Magon, the late minister to Pana
ma and governor of the Canal Zone on
the Isthmus; troops were sent to sup
port them and to relieve the Navy, the
expedition being handled with most
satisfactory speed and efficiency. The
insurgent chiefs immediately agreed
that their troops should lay down
their arms and disband; and the
agreement was carried out. The pro
visional government has left the per
sonnel of the old government and the
old laws, so far as might be, unchang
ed, and will thus administer the island
for a few months until tranquillity can
be restored, a new election properly
held, a new government Inaugurated,
When the election has been held
and the new government inaugurated
In peaceful and orderly fashion the
provisional government will come to
an end. I take this opportunity of
expressing upon behalf of the Amer
ican people, with all possible solera
nity, our most earnest hope that the
people of Cuba will realize the imper
ative need of preserving justice and
keeping order in the Island.
The Rio Conference,
The Second International Confer
ence of American Republics, held
Mexico in the years 1901-2, provided
for the holding of the third confer
ence within Ave years, and committed
the fixing of the time and place and
the arrangements for the conference
to the governing board of the Bureau
of American Republics, composed of
the representatives of all the Ameri
can nations in Washington. That
board discharged the duty Imposed
upon it with marked fidelity and
painstaking care, and upon the cour
teous invitation of the United States
of Brazil, the conference was held at
Rio de Janeiro, continuing from the
23d of July to the 29th of August last,
Many subjects of common Interest to
ail the American nations were dls-
cust by the conference, and the con
elusions reached, embodied In a series
of resolutions and proposed conven
tlons, will be laid before you upon the
coming in of the final report of the
American delegates,
Central America,
Last June trouble which had existed
for some time between the Republics
of Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras
culminated In war a war which
threatened to be ruinous to the coun
tries involved and very destructive to
the commercial Interests of Ameri
cans, Mexicans, and other foreigner
who are taking an important part in
the development of these countries
The thoroly good understanding which
exists between the United States and
Mexico enabled this Government and
that of Mexico to unite in effective
mediation between the warring Re
publics; which mediation resulted, not
without long-continued and patient ef
fort, in bringing about a meeting of
the representatives of the hostll
powers on board a United States war
ship as neutral territory, and peac
was there concluded; a peace whicl
resulted In the saving of thousands of
lives and In the prevention of an In
calculable amount of misery and th
destruction of property and of the
means of llvelihod. The Rio Confer
ence past the following resolution
reference to this action:
"That the Third International Amer
ican Conference shall address to th
Presidents of the United States
America and of the United States of
Mexico a note In which the conference
which Is being held at Rio expresses
its satisfaction at the happy result
of their mediation for the celebration
of peace between the Republics
Guatemala, Honduras, and Salvador
Panama Trip.
I have just returned from a trip to
Panama and shall report you at length
later on the whole subject of the Pan
ama Canal.
The Navy and Army,
The United States Navy Is the sur
est guarantor of peace which this
country possesses. H Is earnestly to
be wisht that we would profit by the
teachings of history in this matter,
strong and wise people will study IJs
own failures no less than its triumphs,
for there Is wisdom to be learned from
the study of both, of the mistake as
wel ns of the success. For this pur
pose nothing could be more instruc
tive than a rational study of the war
of 1812, as it is told, for Instance, by
lr
of
been avoided, If during the preced
ing twelve years a navy relatively as
Btrong as that which this country now
has had been built up, and army pro
vided relatively as good as that which
the country now has, there never
would have been the slighted neces
sity of fighting the war; and it the
necessity had arisen the war would
under such circumstances have ended
lthour Bpeedy and overwhelming tri
umph.
In both the Army and the Navy
there is urgent need that everything
possible should be done to maintain
tho highest standard for the person
nel, alike as regards the officers and
the enlisted men. I do not believe
that in any service there is a finer
body of enlisted men, and of junior of
ficers than we have In both the Army
nd the Navy, Including the Marine
lorps. All possible encouragement, to
the enlisted men should be given, in
pay and otherwise, and everything
practicable done to render the service
attractive to men of the right type.
hey should be hold to the strictest
discharge of Ihelr duty, and in them a
spirit should be encouraged which de
mands not tho mere performance of
duty, but the performance of far more
than duty, if it conduces to the honor
and the Inttrest of the Americnn na
tion; and In return the amplest con
sideration should be theirs.
West Point and Annapolis already
turn out excellent officers. We do not
need to have these schools made more
scholastic.
But In bolh services there Is urgent
need for the establishment of a prin
ciple of selection which will eliminate
men after a certain age If they can
not be promoted from the subordinate
ranks, and which will bring into the
higher ranks fewer men, and these at
an earlier age. But the desire of these
men to be promoted to positions
which they are not competent to fill
should not weigh against the Interests
of the Navy and the country, At pres
ent our men, especially in the Navy,
are kept far too long in the junior
grades, and then, at much too ad
vanced an age, are put quickly thru
the senior grades, often not attaining
to these senior grades until they are
too old to be of real use in them; and
If they are of real use, being put thru
them so quickly that little benefit to
the Navy comes from their having
been In them at all.
The Navy has one great advantage
over the Army In the fact that the of
ficers of high rank are actually trained
in the continual performance of their
duties; that Is. in the management of
the battleships and armored cruisers
gathered Into fleets. This Is not true
of the army officers, who rarely have
corresponding chances to exercise
command over troops under service
conditions. The conduct of the Span
isli war showed the lamentable loss of
life, the useless-extravagance, and the
inefficiency certain to result, if during
pence the high officials of the War and
Navy Departments are praised and re
warded only if they save money at no
matter what cost to the efficiency of
the service, and If the higher officers
are given no chance whatever to ex
ercise and practise command. For
years prior to the Spanish war the
Secretaries of War were praised
chiefly if they practised economy;
which economy, especially In connec
tion with the quartermaster, commis
sary, and medical departments, wav
directly responsible for most of thi-
niismanagement that occurred In the
war itself and parenthetically be It
observel that the very people who
clamored for the misdirected economy
In the first place were foremost to de
nounce the mismanagement, loss, and
suffering which were primarily due
to this same misdirected economy and
to the lack of preparation It Involved
There should soon be an increase in
the number of men for our coast de
fenses; these men should be of the
right type and properly trained; and
there should therefore bo an increase
of pay for certain skilled grades, es
pecially In the coast artillery.
The Congress has most wisely pro
vided for a National Board for the pro
motion of ride practice. Excellent re
sults have already come from this
law, but It does not go far enough
Our Regular Army is so small that in
any great war we should have to trust
mainly to volunteers; and In such
event these' volunteers should already
know how to shoot; for If a soldier
has the fighting edge, and ability to
take care of himself in the open, his
efficiency on the line of battle is al
most directly proportionate to excel
lence in marksmanship. We should
establish shooting galleries In all the
large public and military schools
should ' maintain national target
ranges In different parts of the coun
try, and should in every way encour
age the formation of rifle clubs thru-
out all parts of the land. The little
Republic of Switzerland offers us an
excellent example in all matters con
nected with building up an efficient
citizen soldiery.

Appended to the President's mes
sage is the address of EHhu Root, de

Californians Resent Japanese Natural
ization Clause.
The suggestion In President Roose
velt's message that naturalization be
extended to the Japanese is extremely
distasteful to the California delega

meeting to discuss the San Francisco
situation.

Minor City Topics.
(Continued from Page Five.)
Last evening was the regular meet
g night of the city board of educa
tion but the meeting was postponed
pending the arrival here of Architect
, H. Rapp. Mr. Rapp was expeeted to
each the city yesterday but did not
come for some reason or other. The
high school heating plant is not satis-
ii c lory as the school building can not
be heated sufficiently In cold wenther
and the members of the school board
want to consult with Mr. Rapp about
it.
Train report at 3 p. m., Santa Fe
rain No. 8 of last evening, arrived
today nt 11:30 a, m at which time
also arrived train No, 10. ' Trains
Xos. 2 and 3 were four hours late.
Train No. 1, is an hour and a half
late. Train No, i) half an hour late
and train No, 7 is reported on time.
No report from tonight's train No. 8.
The Denver and Rio Grande train
was four hours late last evening but
Is reported on time today. The San-
a Fe Central was an hour late last
evening tout arrived without eastern
connection which Is delayed by a
freight wreck near Santa Rosa. Xo
report was received of today's train
as last night's high wind put the
telegraph wires out of business.
Last night's rain, instead of' aug
menting the water supply for next
year, decreased It, for it washed the
mountain sides and foothills clear of
snow and today the Santa Fe River Is
carrying to waste a large Volume of
water. However, the large reservoir
of the Santa Fe Water & Light Com
pany is filled to the brim, holding
enough water to supply the city for a
year and a half, and the higher moun
tain peaks are still snow covered.

Investigating Escape of U. S. Pris
oners. V. S. Attorney W. H. II. Llewellyn
was engaged today In making nn offi
cial investigation for and on behalf
of the Department of Justice into the
circumstances attending the escape
from the Territorial Penitentiary of
two United States 'prisoners during
the present year. Major Llewellyn is
acting under1 the authority of the .At
torney General of the United States
an.l will make repont of his investi
gation to that official. It seems that
the two escaped prisoners were dan
gerous criminals; one of them, li is
said, is a counterfeiter and hence the
great Interest taken by the depart
ment in the affair. Major Llewellyn
was also directed to report if the
New Mexico Territorial penitentiary'
was a safe and proper place for !i.e
confinement of U. S. prisoners gener
ally. These Investigations were or
dered some lime since, but press of
other official business- and the mani
fold dalles of the office prevented
hem being carried into effect.
JRAMPS INJURED IN
DISASTROUS TRAIN
WRECK.
El Paso, Texas, Dec. 4. An un
known tramp was killed and throe
others were injured in freight wreck
which occurred Sunday evening on
the El Paso & Southwestern Rail
road -between Duron and Helena.
Fourteen cars' loaded with merchan
dise, together with the locomotive
ami tender of an extra freight; train
were derailed at bridge 210. The en
gine left the track just before the
bridge was reached, pulling off the
tender and fourteen cars. The bridge
collapsed under the strains of the en
gine and cars being dragged across
off ;the rails, and part of the train
went Into the ravine spanned by the
bridge. Th'at the engine crew es
caped injury is little less than a
miracle. The four tramps were steal
ing a ride in one of the cars.
STAYED WITH SHEEP,
PERISHED IN STORM.
Roswell, N. M Dec. 4. When the
body of Jesus Leon Baca was found
frozen stiff, beside a herd of sheep
for which he 'had been caring, another
chapter was added to the list of
of deaths resulting from the recent
blizzard. Baca was employed by Wal
ter Miller, a sheep' raiser of Chaves
County, and was a faithful employe.
His death was doubtless due to the
fact that .he was poorly clothed. The
body wasi brought to Roswell and
burled In the Catholic Cemetery- here.
