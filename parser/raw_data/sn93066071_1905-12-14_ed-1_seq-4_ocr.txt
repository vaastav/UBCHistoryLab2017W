fur the reason that, as a democrat, he .
would be antagonistic to the principals
of the Republican jiarty in that posi
tion. We certainly would do so by ad
vocating the nomination by the Repub

the Journal, towards whose election
even the yellow dog plea of tho Jour
nal could not secure one-half the Re
publican votes of this county.
With the approach of Statehood,

the independent voting or disaffection

let thu rank and hie decide those ques

nominated ns are worthy of the oltices
to which they nMiire, whether it be for
delegate to the Constitutional Conven
tion or road overseer.
Then we can proudly ask the voters
to supiiort our ticket, NOT because its
candidates have run the gauntlet of
some convention, but because they are
men of some standing in their com
munity, because they are worthy of
support as men, and worthy of support
as Republicans.
Whn we do this, the use of a party
whip, or yellow dog plea will not be
necessary in discouraging the tendency
towards independent voting in this
county.
FIRST BUsL, INTRODUCED
The first bill Introduced in Congress
when that honorable body assembled
for the present sesinn was that of
Statehood for Oklahoma and Indian
Territory, by Delegate McGuire.
Delegate McGuire has been working
untiringly for tho measure ever since
tl.e adjournment of Congress lat year
and was ready when the great doors of
the Hall of Supremo Juxt'ee swung
oi-en to be tho first to step within and
claim the attention of the fcilth con
giess in behalf of hi constituents.
The President in his mege lias re
ei mmeuded statehood for the two ter
ritories, and with a fnithful worker at
tint head, such c the people of Okla
homa have in Dt-lepite McGuire, we
lmve till rcartin to believe tliat ere thu

RECOMMENDS STATEHOOD.
I recommend that Indian Territory
and Oklahoma De admitted as one
state and that New Mexico and Ari
zona be admitted as one state. There
is no obligation upon us to treat terri
torial subdivisions, which are matters
of convenience only, as bind us on the
question of admission to statehood.
Nothing hns taken up more time in the
congress during the past few years
than the question as to the statehood
to lie granted to the lour territories
above mentioned, and after careful
consideration of all that has developed
in the discussions of tho question I
recommend that they bo Immediately
admitted as two states. There is no
justification for further delay, and the
advisability of making tho four terri
tories into two states lias been clearly
established.
In some of the territories the legis
lative assemblies issue licence for
gambling. The congress should by
law forbid this practice, the harmful
results oi which are obvious at a
glance.-
Kitract from Presidents
message to Congress,
THE FIFTY-NINTH
CONGRESS
The 59th Congress began its session
at twelve o'clock Mondit) the "Jth of
December. The bcenes of the opening
sebssion were those with which the
country has been made familiar
through the press. There were nearly
four hundred members on the floor of
tho House and seventy-five senators in
the chamber at the other and of the
Capitol. There were no llowers nnd
tho spectacle of certain members sit
ting behind magnificent floral arrange
ments wan lacking. This is a custom
which in the future, will bo more hou
ored by the breach than the observance.
No one, except perhaps the florists, will
regret its uicoMiiuiaiice. The gal
leries were crowded with ladies, many
of them visitors to Washington nnd
others, the wives, daughters or friends
of members and Senators on the floor.
Miss Alice Roosevelt with a party of
friends was in the Kxecutive Gallerv.
as was ulwi Mrs. Fairbanks, the wife of
the ice-l'resident, and her daughter.
Among those conspicuous by their
ab-ence were Senator. Mitchell of
Oregon and Burton of Kansas, and in
House, Mr. Hermann nnd Mr. Wil
liamson or Oregon These gentlemen
are expected to serve their country in
another cajwicity and other localities.
Distinguished and long familiar faces
were missing on the Senate floor
George Frisbeo Hoar, so long a Sena
tor from MasAachusetts; Orville Piatt
of Connecticut nnd his colleague John
R. Hawley; Mathew Stanley Quay of
Pennsylvania; and Vest Cockrill of
.Missouri, or thee distinguished men,
who may almost be bald to belong to
another political era, Senator Cockrill
is the only one living, and is now a
member of the Iuter-State Commerce
Commission.
It is almost Incredible, but over four
thousand bills and resolutions Mere in
troduced in the House on the first day
of tho bcsnion. Of this number there
were five hundred and thirty-ono
measures of a public character. The
remainder of thum wero priate bills,
the vast majority of them being for
elisions.
Mr. Brownlow, of Tennessee, pre-
bcuicu tne largest unmoor, nearly lour
hundred in all, but Mr. Smith of Mich
igan was a clone second with more than
three hundred and fifty bills. Mr.
McGuire, of Oklahoma, presented the
iirst bill which was for the admission
of Oklahoma and Indian Territory as a
I Jii nt state with seven representatives
t in Congress. A number of insurance
I bills were introduced incited bv the
widely iblished insurance ttcandals and
, investitatio;
' 0r reiinsylv;
I i.rv.,.!.,n

ania, has for its object the

Mr. McCurdy says he resigned from

Senator Depew says he will grant no
more interviews to newspaper cor
respondents. It is probable that his ,
'"frunds from up the country" will also j
have difficulty in interviewing him. !
Mr James Hazen Hyde recently of
the Equitable Life Insurance corpora
tion has sold all his horses and car
riages. He will now haveto climb to
the strap and "step lively" just like
plain policy holders.
President Rooevelt resents the pul
lic interest in his private affairs.
Speaking of a letter of condolence on
the injuriv of Theodore Junior in the
foot ball game he said, "Yes, Teddy
had his no?e broken and I wih the
man Unit' wrote that letter had his
head broken.
There are some people arouiKl B t-
ver so susceptible to flattery tnat if a "
hobo should come along and address
them as Captain, General or Colonel
they would hasten to return a military
salute, and say, "Why Moses, have
you come to lead us out of tho Wilder
ness." Fichcr went to some of the demo
crats whom we can mention if neces
sary, and proposed to them that they
buy out the Beaver Herald, and run it
as a democratic paper Fischer would
gladly sec the democrats obtain con
trol of all the papers in the county o
long as they did not deprive him and
the Journal of the whole pic.
People may often wonder why Fis
cher devote Sialf column articles to
booming II. E. G. Putman as the dem
ocratic leader, and Culwell as his sec
ond in command, but it is all very
plain. Putman still owns an interest
In the Journal and Fischer is still en
gaged in thcJask of keeping the Jour
nal plant running both democratic and
republican thunder.
