MALINTA.
Malinta, Dec. 7th.
Mr. Ed.: Please allow ine space in
your columns to correct a few errors
in an article of your last week's issue,
headed "White Caps." In the first
place we deny the assertion of Mr,
W. being a tramp, as he came here
to work for a farmer as respectable a
citizen as we have in Monroe, town
ship, the writer having been acquaint
ed with him after working about a
year in this neighborhood. He did
make his home with the family of the
widow, a family of grown up chil
dren, the youngest a girl of 12 years.
The husband being dead 7 years in
stead of 2 as was stated in the article.
Mr. W. came to the hegUhorliood
about 3 years ago from Pickaway Co.,
leaving a mother, brother and sev
eral halfbrothers and sisters, who un
doubtedly would be pained to hear
of their brother and son being called
a tramp. He is industrious, of no
bad habits, and is . as you stated
harmless. He is also a member of
the K. of P. lodge. Everything was
agreeable with him and the children
knowing that he and their mother
were so called "good friends," the
older ones saying if their mother
wanted to get married they would not
object to him. Aboit three or four
months ago the home place was of
fered for sale and the children be
came dissatisfied, thinking they were
not going to get their share. Since
then there has been dissatisfaction
but no outward appearance until
November 20th, when the White
Caps put in appearance between the
hours of 0 and 7 p. m. just after they
had come home from her, (Mrs. H's.)
sister's, 3 of her children being at
home. Such treatment would do for
a barbarous country but we live in a
civilized country where law and or
der are maintained, life and property
are protected, and we, as citizens do
not tolerate such conduct and think
the matter should be investigated
and the guilty parties brought to
justice. - X. .

Major C. T. Picton is manager of
the State Hotel, at Denison, Texas,
which the trayeling men say is one of
the best hotels in that section. In
speaking of Chamberlain's Colic,
Cholera and Diarrhoea Remedy
Major Picton says; "I have used it
myself and in my family for several
years, and take pleasure in saying
that I consider it an infallible cure
for diarrhoea and dysentery. I al
ways recommened it, and have fre
quently administered it to my guests
in the hotel, and in every case it has
proven itself worthy of unqualified
endorsement. For sale by D. J.

"CALLERS" NOT DESIRED.
A Writer' Beasons For Thinking " Visit
ing" Intolerable.
Of what earthly nse is "company?"
Yon probably see your neighbors once a
week, meeting them on the public high
ways, and if you nod pleasantly and
speak a word or two of the weather and
of the health of the family, has not ev
erything been done that our necessities
require or formality can reasonably de
mand? If we have business or need in
formation that others can give us, go
and ask of them. Be brief, but to the
point, and, leaving with what is de
sired, carry away also their blessing.
To go to another's house, to request of
its inmates, one or all, to sit for half an
hour or longer and listen to your plati
tudes, and coming away lie to them
about a pleasant call, is intolerable.
Vet there are thousands who do this
daily. .
Why should I leave my occupation,
be it loafing even, and give my atten
tion to some man or woman who is
thoughtless enough to "call?" The
actuating motive never appears. Much
is spoken and nothing said. ' I receive
no worthy thought to profit by or in
crease the probability of a beatifio eter
nity. The familiar well gnawed bones
of doctrine fall from the devil'B table.
Usually I am forced to breathe at such
a time a gossip poisoned atmosphere.
This "call" is another idea of civility,
and I -am compelled, it appears, to be a
victim of his or her whim. If I refuse,
as I have done point blank, to present
myself, I am called a boor and all man
ner of ugly names. Lippincott's.
Strange Beginning of a Friendship.
I remember the anecdote my stepfa
ther, Count d'Aure, who entered La
Fleche before the regulation age of 8,
used to tell me. It was the first time he
had left his mother, and he was some
what bewildered by the roughness of
his comrades, who affected the airs of
old troopers. To make sure that he was
not a milksop, one of them, a veteran
of 12, made him lay his hand flat on
the ground, stepped on it and crushed
one of his fingers. This tormentor was
the future General Baraguay d'Hilliers.
The victim, who nearly fainted, bore
it bravely! however. "And this was the
beginning," my stepfather used to add
half a century later,- when showing his
deformed finger, "of a friendship that
lasted all our lives." This happened
shortly after the first empire, when
Roimiu virtues were emulated, but one
must not infer from this isolated fact
that stoicism flourishes vigorously in
the French educational system. Th.
