Tlii is not aa unexpected state of af
fairs, as union services of any consider

burnings and differences on point of
doctrine among the various sects.
Whatever may be the permanent re

certain it ia that he ha given a great
impetus to religious thought ia the
community. It is for the pastors to see
that the interest is maintained.

AMUSEMENT NOT1IS.
"Iolanthe" was well sung by local
talent to a fair audience in The Powers
last evening. All in all it ia one of the
best amateur performance ever given
in (Jrand Kapid. Mrs. Minnie Nichols
was a charming Phyllis, singing her
numbers well and placing aa exacting
part with nice discretion. The full
beauty of her voice waa brought oat in
the bird song, from the opera Brazil,
which merited the hearty encore. Miss
Chamberlain was a sweet I ol an the, and
by her art brought a small part into
prominence. Her solo in the second act
when she appeal to th Lord Chancellor
to allow her son to marry, was dramati
cally rendered and showed the perfect
control of a fine contralto of singular
weetne. Mis Chamberlain ha im-
S roved greatly in the past year. Mrs.
. U. Hoeken was striking a the fairy
queen; her singing of "O Foolish Day
being very artistic As the Lord Chan
cellor, A. Ed Robinson made a decided
hit and furnished a large share of the
fun, demonstrating tljat he is a natural
comedian of high order. The ' Earl of
Mount Ararat of Arthur Kromer was
very fuony; his solo "Wheo Uritian
Keally Ruled the Wave" was excellent
John I). Kromer was a tine foil as ths
Earl of Toiloller. Mr. Curry was in
fine voice and sung and acted Strephon
with nice judgment The quality of bis
clear, resonant baritone has greatly
improved with intelligent usuage. Hi
little dance was repeatedly demanded.
C. Uradley Chatfield was a merry train
bearer, his oo and dance with Mr.
Robinson was delicious. The Minse
Lewis, I)ishman,aod hteinmandid their
little pleasingly. Tho chorus particular
ly the malo voices, was superb, they
attack brilliantly and bring out all the
bvauty'ot their members. "How to tho

have Lis orchestra better in hand and
be ready to play another number as soon
as one is finished. The waits for the
orchestra last night were numerous and

WasKiJfOTO.v, IVc 4. Som of the
view of th prominent legislator on
th president' measag axe act as fol
low: Ex Spaaksr Read: WI dialik to com
ment 00 ths mesaugti, because it would
not be seemly to do it ia adequate
term. It ia a xceediagly disappointing
both ia matter aad maaaer. It ia
largely made up of a weariaom re urn
of the reports of hi aecrwtarle which
Lav hardly beeo Improved by conden
sation. Oa the Hawaiian qusstioo, w
ar left aa much in th dark aa aver aad
must wait th nv of th next lemer
just as ws hav been for ao long. Tba
part of th meaaag which relates to th
tariff ia most aurprlaing. It aaawveratsa
that the hous committee ia charge
of that aubject haa formulated plaaa and
devised method of taxation, wnich aa a
member of the committee, I hav nevr
ven heard proposed. It is a rather un
usual situation to learn of the deed of
the committee, cot in the committee
room, but from th president of th
United Stats. Ha that committee,
composed of both parties, without th
th formality of a word in open com mi t
tes, informed the pridsat of it deter
ruination in such' ways that th presi
dent can officially communicat it to the
houseT How long haa it been part of
our ayatem tha th committee of an in
dependent branch, and above
all tho committee which control
the purse, shall report to con
gress through th president
the result of the rumored blending of
the appoiotive with the executive powerf
It ia bad enough to hav a tariff bill
made up by a little coterie a political
bill,' aa Mr. Wilson calls It-but to hav
it communicated to th president before
It reaches the committee, still lea the
house, show a determination to be
moved by no tact and mollitied by no
arguments, which makes apparent the
absurdity of appointing republicans on
the committee of waya and means at
alL"
Mr. Dalzeil (republican:) "The preal
dent'a viewa on th tariff seem to be on
th line heretofore laid down by him.
He think a protective tariff invariably
increase the cost to th consumer. W
know that such i not th case under
the operations of th McKinley law, a
fact that would hav been apparent to
the president it he had seen tit to read
the testimony takeo before the ways
and means committee. Of course, as
was to be expected, he Is still after the
markets of to world, a very desirable
thiog, if present condition continue, be
cause there wont b any market at home
or acy money to spend ia them. Th
most astonishing thing in the message
is that the income tax haa been agreed
upon. That's new. I happen to be a
member of the minority of the way and
mean committee, but it i th first time
I knew such a tax had been agreed
upon, although I have Inquired dili
gently about it every day. Bo far as the
tariff is concerned, tba message is not a
valuable contribution to the discussion.
What he say i not new. although he
say aome thing that are strange,"
Mr. Wilson, chairman of the waya
and means committee, said: 1 consider
it a very fair and business liks review of
all the public questions in which th
president is called upon to address the
people of the country."
- Mr. Mitchell (rep.) observed that th
message in its foieign policy, and with
special reference to Hawaii, waa simply
indefensible. "Its endorsement of the
tariff," continued Mr. Mitchell, "ia the
endorsement of that which strike a
death blow to every industry on the Pa
cilic coat"
Speaking for the populi't party, Mr.
Peller (populist) said: "Thi message
fuluiis a prediction I made during the
recenfjtlebate on the silver question, and
that was that thers would be no hope
for financial legislation at thi session of
congrces.'
Mr. Voorhee, democrat: "It ia a
strong, able document
General Palmer of Illinois: "I am in
clined to think that th preUent ' idea
concerning fraudulent pensions i wid
of the mark. 1 don't b-jl.eve that 2 per
cent of tho pensions issued are fraudu
lent" Mr. Stewart, republican, one of the
most ardent free silver, men, eurx.mar
ized his opinion in . this one sentence:
"It is the gold standard and bond, with
authority lodged ia the presideat to ne
gotiate with Ecglaud aad mk that
system permanent"
Senator Jones, republican, waa con
tect to let the message pas with the re
mark that be saw ia it no recommenda
tion or suggestion that gave any promise
of relief to the people,
Mr. Springer, democrat The message
i a concise and able exposition of the
present condition of the country,
Mr. Rynum, democrat It im a very
concise, but clear statement of the mul
titude of question which congress will
be called on to consider.
"Ao able and appropriate messag,"
was the comment of Mr. McCreary. "He
present the foreign affairs, the monetary
question and the tariff with 'great
ability.
"The only significant thing about the
whole business." said Senator Chandler,
"is that the president endorses the
WiUon raid oa protected Industrie in
all its details.
Senators Sherman and Hill refused to
express opinion, while Sen tor Murphy
of New York said simply: "it as able
d)jcument."
