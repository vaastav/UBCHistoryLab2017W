The French did nothing in their war

The cold-water douche which the Lon
don Times gives the Nicaragua canal
project need not alarm anybody. The
Times thinks it possible the canal will
never pay. "It is a fascinating scheme,"
It says, "but we have some doubt whether
the canal would be commercially worth
cutting." It might not be to John Bull,
but it will be to Uncle Sam, whose At
lantic and Pacific seaboards will be
brought closer together by it to the ex
tent of several thousand miles and a large
part of American products that much
nearer the open door in China,
' The report of the isthmian canal com
mission showing that that able body of
men believe that the Nicaragua route Is
the most practicable ahd feasible ought to
settle the contention as to the location.
It may also be assumed that this commis
sion has attained a clearer idea of the
difficulties which the construction involves
than have previous commissions. Hereto
fore, it has been given out that Jl 10,000,000
at' tho outside would be sufficient for the
work, but the present commission puts
the cost at over $290.000.000. it is certatnly
a great undertaking, but, so far as indica
tions go, the people of the country gener
ally are very much in favor of the enter
prise.
No person of humane sentiments can re
j ice in the fact that Councilman Higglrs
ha gone to the Stite prison. For a man
like him it is a fearful penalty, yet it
cannot s sjUI that he did not have a fa?r
trial. Aside from a few personal friends
and partisans there Is icason to believe
that public opinion believes he has been
Justly treated. Mr. HUvins seems to have
been cue of that numerous class of men
Trho puafc into municipal affairs for what
there Is in it. There is xeason to suspect
that there ore others who should receive
the same punishment. This suspicion is
confirmed by the action of those members
of the Council who have voted down an
investigation. Two parties can put an end
to such rascalities rs that for which Hig
Rins has been convicted councilmen who
ihould be high-minded men, r.mbltlou.4 to
rve the city faithfully, and those of whom
corrupt cjur.cllmen solicit money for votes.
If the men of whom councilmen demand
money for their votcn sh"ulJ proclaim tho
fact, they would put an cr.;! to such crimes.
Finally", tho fate of HIgpIns should be a
warnirr: to other councilmen who are in
the mrrlret. Felling a vote Is a crime.
TUNNELING Tili: STATU TKEASMtY.
If there is any truth insome of the ru
mors drifting about, the incoming Legisla
ture will be called to deal with a number
of more or loss clever propositions to tun
nel the approaches to the state treasury,
for the benefit of a few persons, Some of
these propositions are old, while some are
new devices. It 13 an era of fads and sci
entific theories, and those who have them
desire to attach them to the taxpayers,
upon the assumption that great good will
result. At the present time there seems
little danger of the success of the scheme
to establish an Insurance department or
bureau independent of the state auditor,
because the folly of such a change is too
palpable. The scheme to create a railroad
commission is, however, being talked of
mainly by those who hope that they will
receive the appointments. Indiana has had
a great railroad system constructed and
operated without the assistance of a rail
road commission During the past few
years there have beifrn no quarrels between
railroad corporations in the State that the
courts cannot adjust if the roads fall to
agree. The claim that a commission Is
necessary to examine the condition of
tracks and bridges Is without reasonable
basis. The companies operating or leasing
the roads In Indiana are managed by men
who realize the injury which a company
suffers in damages and loss of business by
accidents due to defective construction. It
is so much in the interest of railroad com
panies to have Found tracks and bridges
that they will see that both are inspected
much more thoroughly than any commis
sion can do it.
Another equally Indefensible scheme that
Is likely to come up Is the several times de
feated bill to provide for boiler inspection.
Boiler explosion Is too costly a thing for
the owners of any considerable industry
or building using steam to take any risks.
In most large establishments boilers are
Insured and inspected by those who insure.
In other buildings unsafe boilers affect gen
eral insurance. In the larger cities there
are building inspectors, whose duty it is to
look after boilers. Such being the case, it
may be said that the one object of the
proposition is to pay, at the expense of
industry and investment, a few men more
salaries as boiler inspectors. That such of
ficers are not needed is shown by the fact
that there has not been a boiler explosion
in Indiana for a long time, except in small
sawmills or for threshing machines.
There are those who advocate a pure
food commission. If there is not now suffi
cient law to punish those who sell impure
or adulterated food, let such law be en
acted and the local boards of health made
responsible for its enforcement, but there
Is no call for a pure-food commission or
commissioner with a costly staff to go
about i the State doing the work that be
longs to the local authorities. "We have
boards enough; indeed, there are those who
would get rid of some of them.
PROGRESS IN OUR SEW POSSESSIONS.
Recent dispatches from our new island
possessions show a condition of affairs that
should make Americans proud of their
country and government. It can be as
serted without fear of successful contra
diction that no other country or govern
ment ever made as much history to be
proud of in the same length of time as the
United States has done since the present
era of territorial expansion began. The
period covers a little over two years, dating
from the formal annexation of Hawaii July
7. 1S38. At that time the war with Spain
was in full progress without any indication
that it would end In the acquisition of more
Islands. But tho process of expansion begun
with the voluntary annexation of Hawaii
was to be materially accelerated a few
months later by the acquisition as a neces
sary result of the war of Porto Ilicond
the Philippines. No other period of twenty-nine
months in the history of the world
was ever crowded with events of more far
reaching importance or brought greater
credit to any nation. This statement does
not refer to our victories during the war.
but to those since the war to the progress
made in establishing free government where
only corrupt tyranny in its worst forms
had existed before, and in bestowing civil
and religious liberty upon peoples who had
never before known anything of either.
How great this progress has been is shown
by some statements in the President's re
cent message to Congress and in late dis
patches from the islands. In Hawaii,
where Spanish rule did not have to be
rooted out, the population has increased
41 per cent., and, says tho President, "there
has been marked progress in the educa
tional, agricultural and railroad develop
ment of tho islands." In Porto Rico he
reports the civil government established by
the last Congress as in successful opera
tion. "The courts have been established.
The Governor and his associates, working
Intelligently and harmoniously, are meet
ing with commendable success." In the
Philippines, although some disaffection and
disorder still exist, civil government, home
rule and American administrative methods
have been established in the greater part
of the Islands and will soon prevail in every
part. The lines of disorder are rapidly con
tracting and tho area of American sover
eignty and law extending. The President,
alluding to the Philippine commission,
says:
As early as Aug. 21. It), it submitted a
preliminary report, which will be laid be
fore the Congress. 'and from which it ap
pears that already the good effects of re
turning order are felt: that business, in
terrupted by hostilities, is improving as
peace extends: that a larger area is under
sugar cultivation than ever before; that
the customs revenues are greater than at
any time during the Spanish rule; that
economy ami efficiency in the military ad
ministration have created a surplus fund
of $',0.o.ijo available for needed public im
provements: that a stringent civil-service
law is in preparation; that railroad com
munications ure expanding, opening upr
rich districts, and that a comprehensive
scheme of education is being organized,
t r.rr renorts from Ihr rommljulrin hoe

yet more encouraclng advance towirrds In
suring the benefits of liberty and good
government to the Filipinos in the interest
of humanity and with the aim of building
up an enduring, self-supporting and self
administering community in those far East
ern seas.
If the President, who has better informa
tion and greater responsibility in the mat
ter than anybody else, can take this op
timistic view of the situation why should
not all Americans do so?
Late dispatches confirm the President's
views. In Porto Rico the first legislative
assembly has just met and organized, a
resolution of greetings was cabled to Presi
dent .McKinley, the Governor's message
has been well received and favorably com
mented on, and throughout the whole
Inland the spirit of lethargy and resentment
that prevailed under Spanish rule are giv
ing way to one of hearty acquiescence and
co-operation in republican government un
der the American flag. During the last
year the number of schools In the island
Increased 1S4, and the people show great
Interest in school extension. This is more
than encouraging progress; it is magnifi
cent. These facts show how completely mis
taken were those who predicted that what
they wrongly called the colonial policy of
the United States would never succeed. It
Is not a colonial policy, but a policy of re
publican propagandlsm and assimilation
under which the benefits of free govern
ment are to be extended to new countries
and peoples. Instead of showing any signs
of failure it is producing results that must
add incalculably to the prestige of the
American people and government.
The annual flower show at the opening
of Congress seems this year to have sur
passed all previous ones. The covering of
members' desks with huge bouquets and
floral pieces is a senseless practice, with
out meaning because it is Indiscriminate.
The Washington correspondent of the
New York Tribune takes a correct view of
the case when he says: "From small be
ginnings ten years ago, when the desk -of
the 'father of the House, the speaker and
half a dozen leaders were ornamented with
a few simple flowers at the opening of ses
sions, the custom has developed until to
day it has reached alarming and expensive
proportions, savoring of Indiscriminate
compliment, and in some instances taking
on the appearance of a rivalry of con
ceit." The practice has outlived whatever
significance it ever had and should cease.
State Factory Inspector McAbee's an
nual report shows that he has been a very
busy official and a very useful one. To
have made 1,732 personal inspections during
the year, even if some were superficial,
argues activity. The results are shown In
the better enforcement of the laws for the
safety and comfort of working people, men,
women and children, and in steadily im
proved conditlonsr The report contains
some interesting statements regarding In
diana's industries as, for instance, that of
seven million dozen lamp chimneys man
ufactured In the United States, Indiana's
quota Is 2,500,000 dozen, more than one
third of all, and that more than 15,000 per
sons are employed in various branches of
the glass industry alone.
The German papers are hypercritical re
garding the President's message. 'His
statement that "Good will prevails In our
relations with the German empire" is
thought by them not to be as strong as
"Our friendly relations with Great Britain
continue." As to France he said: "The
year of the exposition has been fruitful in
occasions for displaying the good will that
exists between this country and Prance."
All this is only a difference of phraseology
intended to show, as tho President says in
another place, that, "Apart from the Chi
nese problem, our relations with the pow
ers have been happy." "Good will" is as
strong an expression as "friendly rela
tions." The German editors should study
English.
The attempt to explain away the deficit
of the K)-cent city tax levy after a 70-cent
levy had scarcely paid out by saying that
there would have 'been no deficit if the
mayor's recommendation to tax thonatural
gas mains had been adopted, is futile. If
that tax had been laid and collected th-
deficit would have been $00,000 less, or about
5110.000, Instead of 50,000. The taxing of
the mains was a belated idea of the mayor.
During four years, with Democratic Coun
cils that always did his bidding, the tax
ing of the mains was not thought of.
By a mistake of the types the caption of
an editorial in yesterday's Journal was
made to read "President McKlnley's Im
perialism" instead of "Impersonalisin."
PROM SHIP TO SHORE.
Wirde 3IeMnnKe?i Transmitted uitii
Knur In EnKll"h Channel.
WASHINGTON, Dec. 5.-Consul Roose
velt, at Brussels, reports to the State De
partment that a station has been estab
lished at La Panne, Belgium, for the ex
change of wireless telegraphic messages
between Belgium and England. La Panne
was selected on account of Its being the
point of the Belgium littoral nearest (the
English coast and a mast of the Marconi
system, 130 feet high, was erected there.
The Dover-Ostend mail boat. Princess
Clementine, was fitted up with temporary
apparatus for use in experimental trials.
An additional mast was fixed to the fore
mast of this vessel, increasing its original
height about sixty feet. From that ex
tremity the telegraphic waves are project
ed towards each coast. A special room
has been fitted up on the steamer for the
instruments, and from that room the cable
is carried to the top of the extended mast.
It is confidently exacted to maintain
communication between ship and shore
for at least thirty miles, which is about
half way across. With stations at La
I'anne and Dover those on board the ves
sel will be able to keep in touch with the
land during the entire trip across.
Recent experiments showed that replies
arrived with the same regularity and ce
lerity as ordinary telegrams. When about
forty miles from Ostend the captain was
enabled to telegraph the station master at
Ostend the probable hour of his arrival.
Various telegrams were sent from the ves
sel to Ostend, Brussels and London, and
the reception of each message was ac
knowledged promptly. Subsequently, the
consul adds, a message was sent from
the vessel to the station at Dover Court,
Essex, a distance of nearly ninety miles,
Including many miles of cliffs and sea.

HITCHCOCK'S REPORT

NEARLY 1,000,000 PENSIONERS
OVER TWO AND A HALF BILLION
DOLLARS PAID SINCE 18G5.
Attention Directed to Lous Which Are
Faulty und Fruitful of Fraud
Recommendations,
WASHINGTON, Dec 5. The annual re
port of Ethan Allen Hitchcock, secretary of
the interior, made public to-day, covers
more ground than any other departmental
report. Over 130,000 words are required to
review the work of the various bureaus and
institutions under Mr. Hitchcock's direc
tion, and Congress is continually extending
the duties of the secretary. On this point
Mr. Hitchcock says:
"The scope of the jurisdiction of this de
partment is wide, and the affairs in its
keeping are varied. The labor involved in
supervising and directing the great di
versity of national affairs submitted under
you to this department is enormous and
has frequently severely taxed the energies
of the several secretaries. In addition to
the accumulation of business arising from
the rapid development and extension of the
country, Congress has, from time to time,
imposed new duties on this department,
greatly augmenting the work to be dis
posed of without any material additions to
the force. This increase of work is notable
in the secretary's office, the great clearing
bouse of the department, where the hand
ling of the details of the vast volume of
business devolves principally upon the chief
clerk and the several chiefs of divisions,
and requires the exercise of good Judg
ment, superior business qualifications, ad
ministrative ability, and, very frequently,
legal knowledge. I have accordingly sub
mitted to Congress, in the annual estimates
of the department, such recommendations
I as the circumstances appear to demand."
A large portion of the secretary s report
has hitherto been made public in the re
ports of heads of bureaus. Included in the
secretary's review on the operation of the
Indian Bureau, the Patent Office, the Public
Land Office, the geological survey, the Cen
sus Bureau, the Educational Bureau, docu
ment division of the department, the Rail
way Bureau, all the Territories, including
Alaska, Hawaii and Porto Rico, the elee
mosynary institutions, etc.
PENSIONS.
The most interesting feature of the re
port Is that relating to pensions. The sec
retary says:
"The report of the commissioner of pen
sions shows that on June 30, 1S:J, there
were 1)1.519 pensioners borne on the roils.
During the fiscal year ended June 30, lftm,
there were allowed 40,643 pensions on orig
inal applications, and the number restored
to the rolls was 4.6i'9, making a total of
new names added to the rolls of 45.344. The
pensioners dropped from the rolls during
the year by reason of death and all other
causes aggregated 43,034, leaving the num
ber remaining on the rolls June 30, 1D00 y93,
52i, a net increase of 2.010 as compared
with the previous fiscal year lb0. The pen
sioners borne upon the rolls on June 30, 1900,
are classified as follows, to wit: .
Widows and daughters of revolution

"The number of claims adjudicated dur
ing the year was 229.720, of which 124,123
were rejections and 103,5;l allowances, the
latter divided as follows: Original pension
claims, 40,615; restorations, 4.01O; increase,
reissues and additional, 41,674; accrued and
eiupllcates. 15.573.
"The report of the commissioner shows
that the total number of claims of all
classes pending on June 30, 1900, was 437,104,
being a reduction of 40,133 claims for the
fiscal year and a reduction of 197,953 claims
since June 30, 1S9S. Of the total number of
pending claims only 155.990 are for original
pension, and about 40,0no of these are dupli
cates, leaving about 110,000 claimants who
have never received any pension.
"The act of Feb. 4. 1899, appropriated
$144,000,000 for the payment of army and
navy pensions. Including repayments to
the appropriation ($4,898.90). the sum avail
able for pensions for the fiscal year PJOO
was $144,004.!S.SO.
"The amount elisbursed for army pen
sions during the year was $134,700,597.24 and
lor navy pensions $3,761,533.41, a total of
5138,462,130.03. leaving an unexpended bal
ance of $5.542.763.25 10 be covered Into the
treasury, and showing an increase over
the previous year's expenditure of J107.077.70.
"The salaries and other expenses of the
Tension Bureau amounted to $2.571,396.78;
the cost of disbursements, fees of exam
ining surgeons, etc., was $1,270,309.96 mak
ing the gross expenditure on account of
pensions, disbursements, office expenses,
clerk hire, etc., $142,30?.S37.39.
ANNUAL VALUE OF THE ROLL.
"The annual value of the pension roll a
it stood on June 30, 1900, was $131,534,544, a
decrease of $S3,417 in the annual value of
the roll from the j-ear preceding. The de
crease was brought abbut mainly by the
death of pensioners receiving high rates of
pension, and for the same reason the
average annual value of all pensions for
the fiscal year decreased from $132.74 on
June 30, 1S99, to $132.39 on June 30, 1900. Tho
annual average value of general-law pen
sions has increased from $165.70 to $167.53,
while the average rate under the act of
June 27, 1S90, has decreased from $lüs.9J to
$10$.2S; and the average rate of pensions
granted on account of service in the war
with Spain has also decreased from $196.53
to $169.10.
"Up to. the close of the fiscal year there
had been filed 27,047 invalid claims and 3.931
widows' claims, based upon service in the
war with Spain, and of these, 926 Invalid
claims and S&S widows' claims had been al
lowed. "The tctal number of original applica
tions for pensions filed during the year was
51,964, which number includes 13,421 on ac
count of service in the war with Spain.
"The number of pensioners living in for
eign countries at the close of the year was
4,526, to whom was -paid in pensions the
sum of $639.S49.23.
"The number of special acts granting
pensions passed at the first session of the
Fifty-sixth Congress was f84.
"Six of the eighteen pension agencies still
occupy leased quarters, at a total annual
rental of $12,4S0. The names of all pen
sioners residing out of the territory fn
which they were paid have been trans
ferred to the rolls of the agency district
in which they reside, in compliance with
the teims of executive order of May 7,
1S77, which directed that all pensioners re
siding within each separate district shall
be paid by tho agency located in said dis
trict. The work of the agencies Is per
formed with promptness, and work con
nected with the payment of pensioners is
kept well in hand.
"The commissioner reports that the work
of the Pension Bureau, with respect to
original claims for penslon. Is practically
current, and states that the adjudication of
claims can be greatly facilitated by prompt
ness on the part of claimants and attor
neys in furnishing the requisite evidence.
'Substantial progress In the adjudica
tion of claim has been made during the
past year, and further progress in this di
rection is expected during the present year.
"Attention is again directed to the act
of June 7, 1SSS, which repealed all limita
tions as to date of filing the application in
cases of widows of deceased soldiers and
sailors, and made their pensions commence
from the date of death of the husband, re
gardless of the time when the application
of pension is filed by the widow. No pen
sion legislation, the commissioner states,
that has ever been enacted has becn so
fruitful of fraudulent practice as the act of
June 7, 1SSS. and he expresses the opinion
that a law which encourages crime and
offers Inducements for the tiling and prose
cution of fraudulent claims should not
have a place on the statute books.
"The soldier who endured the hardships
and privations of service receives pension
from date of filing his claim, and the same
law should apply to claims riled on account
of his service and death.
"The commissioner again calls attention
to his former recommendations as to the
necessity for a thorough revision of the
pension laws with a view of making their
operations more uniform in character, and
expresses the opinion that a commission
should be appointed for that purpose, to the
end that the benefits conferred in the way
of pensions may be more equitably dis
tributed among the beneficiaries.
"The act of April IS. 1900, repealed the
provisions of Section 4716 of the Revised
Statutes, so far as the same may be appli
cable to the claims for pension of depend
ent parents of soldiers, sailors and ma
rines who served during thjß war with
Spain. The effect of this act is to give
title to pension in cases where its bene
ficiaries voluntarily engaged in. or aided
or abetted the late rebellion againt the au
thority of the United States, and whose
sons have died or may hereafter die as a
result of service in the army or navy dur
ing the war with Spain. While this law will
relieve many meritorious claimants, it Is
believed that the time has come when the
provisions of Section 4716 should also be
repealed, in so far as they affect claims
filed under the act of June 27. 1390, where
the soldier served In the Confederate army
prior to his service In the army or navy
of the United States.
"The act of May 9, lVX), is an amendment
of the act of June 27. 1S90, and, among
other things, provides that in determining
the inability of a soldier claimant to earn
a support each and every infirmity shall be
duly considered and the aggregate of the
disabilities shown be rated.
"Supplemental instructions have accord
ingly been issued to examining surgeons for
their guidance in the examination of claim
ants for pension and increase of pension
under this act and the reports of medical
examinations made under these instructions
show a marked improvement In the work
of the surgeons in this class of cases.
"The act of May 9. 1900. extends the pro
visions of the act of June 27f 1890, to such
widows as are without means of support
other than their dally labor and an actual
net income not exceeding $250 per year.
"Directions have therefore been given to
re-examine all claims of widows for pen
sion under See. 3 of the act of June 27
1S30, heretofore rejected, and in each in
stance where the conditions shown warrant
the belief that applicant may be entitled to
pension under said section as amended May
9, 1900, a blank application is forwarded to
the applicant, with detinlte Instructions as
to its execution and the evidence require!.
The same action is taken In pending claims
where the conditions shown warrant the
belief that under the practice existing prl.ir
to May 9, 1900, the claim would have been
rejected.
"It is believed that under the operations
of this act there will be a marked increase
in the number of pensioners during the
present year and that the annual payments
for pensions will be increased by from $3.
000, 0UO to $1,000,OUO.
LEGAL MARRIAGES.
"The act of Aug. 7, 1SS2, provides that
marriages shall be proven in pension case3
to be legal marriages according to the law
of the place where the parties reside! at
the time of marriage or at the time when
the right of pension accrued. The effect cf
this law has been to deny claimants, !n
many instances, the status of legal widow
hood, although the equities appear to be in
favor of such claimants. It is desirable
that Congress so amend the act of Aug. 7,
1ÜS2, as to provide for the admission cf evi
dence to prove marriages for pensionable
purposes by a standard which wilt be uni
form through the entire jurisdiction of the
United States.
"There is no legislation under which the
action of the commissioner of pensions or
of the secretary of the interior. In the al
lowance or rejection of a pension claim,
can be reviewed in the courts, nor is there
legislation under which a pension claim
can be referred to the courts lor adjudica
tion. Congress has provided for the refer
ence to the Court of Claims of claims pend
ing before the several executive depart
ments, the decision of which will affect a
class of claims or furnish a precedent for
the future action of these departments.
The result is, that there is at present no
method of obtaining a judicial interpreta
tion of the pension laws, although their
administration directly affects many thou
sand citizens and involves an annual ex
penditure of many millions of dollars of
public moneys. The interpretation of these
laws has fallen upon the commissioner of
pensions and the secretary of the interior,
and the persons succeeding to these offices
from time to time, while always acting un
der the influence of high motives, have not
always entertained the same views re
specting the purpose and meaning of these
laws, and have, in some instances, inter
preted them each for himself, according to
his Judgment and understanding, so that
pension decisions, on some questions, are
conflicting and difficult to follow. The
pension statutes have greatly multiplied,
and it has sometimes happened that a new
statute has employed ambiguous and un
certain terms or has been enacted without
special reference to the body of existing
legislation upon that subject, in conse
quence of which difficult and important
questions of law are encountered in the
interpretation and administration of the
pension laws. s
APPEAL TO COURTS SUGGESTED.
"In my judgment, a matter of this char
acter which so vitally affects the comfort
and happiness of so large a portion of our
population, and which involves- so great
an expenditure of public moneys, is wor
thy of the attention and consideration of
our judicial tribunals. If decisions of the
Supreme Court should be had upon a lim
ited number of test cases, it would very
greatfy simplify the work of the Pension
Bureau, would inspire confidence in the
Interpretation of the pension laws, and
would lead to uniform action in their ad
ministration. It is understood that here
tofore there has been objection to refer
ring pension claims to the courts, for the
reason that it would have a tendency to
clog and overload the courts and to shift
the administration of the pension laws
from the executive to the judicial branch
of the government. This objection, how
ever, would seem to be avoided if the num
ber of claims which could be so referred
was carefully limited.
"To carry into -effect my views in th?
premises, I have transmitted to Congress
a form of bill which has been introduced
and is row pending. In my judgment its
enactment as a law would be in the inter
est of good administration."
The secretary says there has been dis
bursed on account of pensions and ex
penses Incident to the execution of the
pension laws, from 1.S66 to 1900, inclusive,
the sum of $2.612,327,643.91. ,The following

FOIt FORTIFICATIONS.
o Danger of Drltnln Acquiring Land
on the Isthmax If the Clayton
ltnlvrer Treaty lie Abrogated.
WASHINGTON, Dec. 5. The Hay
Pauncefote treaty concerning the Nica
ragua canal was the subject of a few
minutes consideration to-day by the Sen
ate committee on foreign relations, which
committee has charge of the treaty In the
Senate. The treaty already has been re
ported by the committee, and It was there
fore only taken up In an Informal way and
for discussion . only. No' conclusion was
possible except to decide to press the ques
tion In the Senate, and there was sub
stantial agreement upon the wisdom of
this policy. There is no division In the
committee except on amendments, although
Senator Bacon did not manifest any great
concern for the passage of the treaty In
any shape. No vote on any subject con
nected with the treaty was possible In the
committee, but the discussion revealed the
fact that the committee Is evenly divided
on the question of amending the document
in accordance with the provision reported
during the last session of Congress pro
viding for the fortification of the proposed
canal. The committee stands as follows:
For the amendment. Messrs. Lodge and
Clark, Republicans, and Daniel, Uacon and
Money, Democrats; against it, Messrs.
Frye, Cullom. Foraker and Wolcott, Re
publicans, and Morgan, Democrat. The
advocates of both lines of policy each ex
press the opinion that the opposing side
will In the end surrender.
Senator Lodge was subjected to many
questions during the presentation of his
explanation of the treaty. Senator Rever-
idge asked whether it was not true that
the abrogation of the Clayton-Uulwer
treaty, as provided for in the pending
treaty, would have the 'effect of permitting
Great Britain to acquire property In the
area affected.
Senator Eodge replied in the negative,
saying that It was well known to all that
the Hay-Pauneefote treaty, wnile abro
gating the Clayton-Bulwer treaty so far
as it applies to the United States and
binds .this country, still leaves England
bound "by its terms. For this reason he
was sure there need be no apprehension
on that score.
Senator Lodge discussed the amendment
suggested during the last session of Con
gress by the committee on foreign rela
tions providing that none of the provi
sions of the first five sections of the treaty
should be construed as applying to "meas
ures which the United States may find it
necessary to take for securing by its own
forces the the defense of the United States
and the maintenance of public order." The
senator urged that this amendment had
the effect of giving greater assurance to
our own people and was a necessary safe
guard. At this point Senator Lindsay, of Ken
tucky, interjected a question, and in doing
so made quite a statement as to what he
said he considered a popular misapprehen
sion as to the effect of the amendment. "I
find," he said, "that most people appear to
think that this amendment provides for
the fortification of the canal, whereas It
does nothing of the kind, as a reading of
it will demonstrate." He then quoted from
the amendment, showing that it applied
specifically to only Sections 1, 2, 3. 4 and 5
of Article 2 of the treaty. He claimed that
it only provides in the most general way
for the protection of the rights of the
United States. He called attention to the
fact that, while the treaty of Constanti
nople applying to the Sues canal had been
used as the basis for the pending treaty,
only the first seven articles of it had been
incorporated In the Hay-Pauncefote
agreement, leaving out Article 30 of that
agreement, which gives to the Sultan of
Egypt the right to defend the interests of
that country in connection with the Suez
canal.
Replying, Senator Lodge said that he had
not contended and did not contend that tho
amendment conferred specifically the power
to fortify the canal. The great benefit of
the amendment was found, he said. In the
fact that It applies to the first section
copied from the Constantinople agreement
providing that the canal "shall be free and
open in time of war as In time of peace
to the vessels of commerce and of war of
all nations." The amendment, he further
said, was substantially in the language of
Article 10 of the Constantinople treats', and
therefore might be expected to serve the
same purpose intended to be subserved by
that article with reference to the Suez
canal. In conclusion he urged early action
on the treaty as of great importance, be
cause of the general desire to go on with
the Nicaragua canal legislation. He did
not. however, indicate any time for taking
a vote on either the treat' or the com
mittee amendment.
Senator Money, of Mississippi, made a
brief speech in general opposition to the
treaty, but indicating that he might vote
for it if the amendment was retained,
though not satisfied, he said, that the
amendment would m.-tke the document en
tirely satisfactory. Upon the whole, he
thought the United States would best pro
mote its own Interest by proeeedlng to con
struct the canal without asking the aid or
consent of any other country.
During the executive session. In which
the Hay-Pauncefote treaty was under con
sideration, several comparatively unimpor
tant treaties with other countries, largely
South American, were laid before the Sen
ate and referred to the committee on for
eign relations. Some of these were reci
procity treaties and others extradition
agreements. One of them was a reciproc
ity agreement with Ecuador and another a
treaty with Denmark providing for rec
iprocity with the island of Santa Cruz.
Later in the day a second executive ses
sion was held, but no business was trans
acted beyond the reference of several nom
inations to the proper committees.
Thinks the Canal Will He Unlit.
LONDON, Dec. 6. The Daily Chronicle,
which admits that "there is a doubt as to
the profitableness of a canal across Nicara
gua," says: "Considering the wonderful
expansion of American trade, however,
success is not so unlikely as detractors of
the project wish it to appear. Nevertheless
if the prospects were live times as problem
atical as they are. we must face the cer
tainty that the canal will be constructed in
the very near future."
OPPOSE POLYGAMY.
Women Adopt Resolution t'rglnR
Congress to Take Action.
NEW YORK, Dec. 5. A meeting was
held here to-day under the auspices of the
Interdenominational Council of Women for
Christian and Patriotic Service to further
the agitation for the adoption of an amend
ment for the federal Constitution forbid
ding polygamy.
Darwin IL James presided and read a
letter from ex-Senator Edmunds to Mrs.
D. R. James favoring the adoption of such
an amendment. Resolutions were adopted
in which the charge was made that Mor
mons are resuming their polygamous prac
tices in Utah and spreading their doctrines
to Idaho, Wyoming, Colorado, Nevada, Ari
zona and New Mexico. Therefore, it was
resolved to urf?e Conirre to tuke prompt
action In submitting to the several States
a constitutional amendment "forever pro
hibiting the practice of polygamy and po
lygamous cohabitation in the United
States and all places subject to Us Juris
diction," and that as a step toward this
end "we urge thj judiciary committee of
the House of Representatives, before whom
lulls are pending lor the submission of an
amendment prohibiting polygamy tnd po
lygamous cohabitation and providing for
the disfranchisement of those who persist
In such practice, to give these important1
measures immediate action. o &n to got
their report upon the calendar In time to

SENATOR FRVI'S SPEECH.
Provisions of the Shipping Hill Ex
plained nt Length.
WASHINGTON. Dec. 5.-Senator Frye at
to-day's session of the Senate concluded
his speech on the ship subsidy bill, lie
devoted his attention principally to a tevh
nlcal explanation of the various provisions
of the measure, explaining with especial
care that provision which would admit
to American registry foreign built ships.
From several sources his attention was di
rected to this provision, and it is evidently
one upon which much of the forthcoming
debate will rest. Aside from the speech
of Mr. Frye no business of importance was
transacted In legislative sessfon.
When the session opened the credentials
of Samuel D. McEne ry and Murphy J- Fos
ter as senators from lulslana and deorgo
P. Wetmore, from Rhode Island, were re
ceived. Bills were passed permitting fapt. B. II.
McCalla and Commander W. C. Wise, of
the United States navy, to accept decora
tions from the Emperor of Germany.
The resolution introduced yesterday by
Mr. Pettigrew calling for information as tr.
the postal frauds in C?uba was referred t
the committee on relations with Cuba.
The Senate at 12:25, on motion of Mr,
Lodge, went into executive session, re
maining behind closed doors until 2 o'clock.
The House bill for the celebration of tha
establishment of the jeat of national gov
ernment in the city ot Washington was
passed without discussion.
Consideration of the ship subsidy bill was
then resumed. Mr. Frye. concluding his
Epeech begun yesterday, said the amount
of subsidy could be no more than JO.Oi.im)
per year. That limit, he said, was fixel
definitely In the bill. "So lar as the
cost to the government Is concerned," he
added, "it will be really no more than
$7.500,000, as the subsidized ships are re
quired to carry the United States mails
free of cost to the government." There
was absolutely no truth In the remarkable
statement that $3l.fton.ow and SWOO.f '. and
even as high as $loo,oo),o0 a year would lo
the cost. The limit of nine millions in the
subsidy would not b reached for at least
five years as within that period there
would not be enough vessels to draw the
full amount of the subsidy. When the
limit of nine 'millions is reached the sub
sidy would be pro rated so all vessels would
be on precisely the same plan and would
receive perfectly impartial treatment.
Referring to a provision of the pending
bill requiring nil ships to take freight up
trt a certain percentage of th'lr carrying
capiclty. Mr. Frye said it would prevent
vessels like the American liner St. LouH
frcin participating in the benefits of the act.
He announced, therefore, that to-morrow
he would propose to the committee on com-
n erce an amendment equal to RO per cent.
of the carrying capacity when leaving a
port of tho United States for a foreign
rort. That would so distribute the products
to be carried as to do no Injustice to any
body. Discussing that provision of the bill which
enables foreign built ships to le brought
under the American flag and to enjoy a por
tion of the proposed subsidy under certain
restrictions, Mr. Frye said It had been as
serted that &0,0W tons of foreign vessels
would come In at once under the provision
as it now stands. He said it was his pur
pose to offer a substitute for the present
provision so that it could be determined
dt finitely Just how many foreign vessels
would be admitted to American registry.
Mr. Hale Interrupted his coP.eague to di
rect his attention to a memorial of ship
builders which he had received. He said
he was in sympathy with the general pro
visions of the bill, but admitted he was
troubled by that provision which enabled
foreign-built vessels to be brought under
the American flag to enjoy the proposed
subsidy. He had received, he added, a
strong protest against this provision cf the
measure signed by forty or fifty ship
builders. In the course of which statement
was made that already parties are engaged
In foreign shipyards In the construction of
vessels which were to participate In the
proposed subsidy. "It Is said," added Mr.
Hale, "that the bounty for foreisTi-built
ships will amount to more than $3.o0,t0 ,
year. I do not think my colleague would
look with favor upon any such proposition
as that."
Mr. Frye said there was only one trouble
with the statement made In the protest,
and that was that It was not true. "Under
the provisions of the penllng bill." said he.
"owners of foreign-built ships cannot draw
a cent of bounty until they construct in the
shipyards of this country an amount of
tonnage equal to that which they have
brought from abroad." He Inlleved a pro
vision for the admission of foreign-built
ships under proper restrictions was wise,
because it would insure to the United
States a respectable fWt of merchant ves
sels within a reasonable time. The success
of the venture by which the New York and
Paris had been admitted to registry had in
duced him to insert in the pending measure
the provision for the admission of a certain
fixed number of forelgn-bullt vessels to
American registry under similar restric
tions. He did not believe that another ship
wouiu be admitted to American registry ex
cept tho$e specifically provided for In the
pending measure.
In conclusion Mr. Frye referred to whit
he termed the "wild nnl Insane criticism"
of the measure, criticism which, he said,
was based upon no fair or accurate knowl
edge of the provisions of the bill.
On motion cf Mr. Piatt, of Connect.'cuL
the Senate, at 2:43 p. m., btld a brief ex
