LENA CORRESPONDENCE.
LENA, LA.,
Dec. 5th, 1895.
MR. EDITOR-
Dear Sir:--Wi!l you please grant
me space in your valuable paper
to ask a question or two concern
ing the position of several of the
candidates for the Legislature up
on the matter of voting for a Unit
ed States Senator?
I have heard it said that Mr. Mil
ler, Mr. Smith, Mr. Wilson and Mr.
Ariail would vote for a gold bug
for the U. S. Senate before they
would vote for Mr. Blanchard.
Will these gentlemen kindly an
swer what they would do in the
event the contest should narrow
down to Mr. Blanchard upon one
side and Mr. Boatuer or some oth
er gold bug upon the other?
Would they vote for Mr. Blanch
ard or the gold bug?
The people hereabouts do not
agree with Mr. Blanchard about
keeping the silver question out of
State politics and they want a
man in the U. S. Senate in full
sympathy with them, but Mr.
Blauchard is a silvier man, for all
his votes in Congress prove it and
I would not be willing to send a
gold bug to the Senate just to de
feat Mr. Blanchard.
While we may differ with Mr.
Blanchard in some matters, yet
we will take him every time in
preference to a gold bug.
It has been my desire to vote
for one or more of the above namn
ed gentlemen for the Legislature,
but I cannot vote for men who
would sacrifice silver to satisety a
prejudice.
1 hope these gentlemen will at
once deny positively this charge
against them.
A SILVERITE.

The Democratic Executive Corn
mnittee of Rapides Parish mnet at

Blackman was elected temporary

from the Executive Committee of

called to nominate a State Senator.
The chairman stated that he
had replied informing the Vernon
Committee that RIapides had al
ready ordered a primary on the
16th of December to select a nomi.
