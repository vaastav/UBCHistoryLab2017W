Ilnnil, Who l'lnally Dispatches Them
With a Club.
Anderson, Ind., Dec, a Last ovonlng
John Martin, a farm hand, residing In tho
extreme northern part of tho county, had
n. terrific tussle with a pair ot wildcats. It
was In the dusk ot tho evening, nnd Martin
was passing through a narrow strip of
timber. Ho was walking slowly along tho
highway, when nil of a sudden ho woi
startlod by n shrill scream, nnd n cata
mount Bprnng from a low clump ot bushos
Into tho middle of tho road In front of him,
Tho animal was unusually largo and
rrnitniii. Mnilln saw at once that
there was to be a fight to a. finish,
nnd thoro was a mortal dread ns
to what tho result might bo. Thoro was
no tlmo to bo lost, for tho cat was thoro for
business. Sho sprang at tho man's throng
but rocoived a whnck with his walking
stick which laid hor on hor back. Just at
this juncturo tho malo cat appeared on tho
scono. Boforo Martin could recover his
guard tho malo caught him by tho suoui
der bb it leaped and raked him, tearing o
soction of his coat and about six Inches of
skin and flosh Into ribbons. Fortunately
tho cat mlssod Its calculations as tho ninn
swung about with tho weight ot his blow
upon tho first ono. As it was, tho wound
was vory painful. By this tlmo tho malo
had got on Its foot again, and both cats
prepared to spring at once. Martin, see
ing that tho affair was gottlng ser
ious, backod up ngalnst a troo and
awaited their onslaught Ho didn't
hnvo long to wait, as tho malo
snarling with rngo, made a leap at his
throat, whllo tho female crept to ono sido,
ns If io flank him. This fact saved tho
man, as ltgnvo him tlmo to relievo tho big
gest ono, which ho skillfully did by jump
ing to the right nnd striking it ns it struck
the trco whero ho had just stood. Tho
blow knocked it senseless. Tho fomnlo
mado a flying lenp, but another quick
movoment nllowod her to strlko tho base of
tho tree, whero tho man hnil stood. Ho
govo it ono hard blow on tho sldo, but
slipped nnd fell, when tbo cat burled hor
teeth and claws In his logs. It wns
now a rolling, tumbling fight for a.
very brief porlod, but tho man's good
luck did not desert blm, as ho was fortun
nto enough to hit tho animal on tho back,
breaking its spine. As soon as bo could
freo btmsolt from her embrnco ho ran to
tho malo, which was just gottlng on Ita
feet, nnd hit It two or throo terrible blows,
which killed It. Both cats were now dead,
but tho man wns bo badly torn nnd
oxhaustod that ho had groat dlfllculty In
..miring his wav to tho rcsldonco of tho
nonrcist neighbor, whero ho wns put to bod.
Ho is still laid up from the effects of his
Injuries, nnd is likely to bo for somo timo
to come.
