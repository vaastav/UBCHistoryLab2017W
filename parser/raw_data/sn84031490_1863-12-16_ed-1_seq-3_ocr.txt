THE PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE.
Els Discn-sion of tbe Rebellion
and Reconstruction.
THE PROCLAMATION OF AMNESTY
AND THE RETURN OF STATES.
[We reprint, from an official copy, the portions
of the President’s Message referring to the rebel
lion and reconstruction, with tbe Proclamation in
which thcee h!a views ore embodied. Wo repub
lish these from an official copy, correcting the very
numerous and damaging errors incident (but we
do not believe inseparable) to its transmission by
telegraph. These important documents are thus
given our readers in the form in which they will
4*o down to history. In the other portions of the
Message the errors were less material, and .we'do
cot republish them.— Eds. Tktb.]
THE REBELLION.
Y.lien Congress assembled a year ago the
war had already lasted nearly twenty months,
and there had been many conflicts .on both
lane and sea, with varying results. The re
bellion had been pressed back into reduced
limits; yet the tone of public feeling and
opinion, at home and abroad, was not. satis
factory. With other signs, the popular elec
tions, then just past, indicated uneasiness
among ourselves, while amid much that
was cold and menacing the kindest words
coming from Europe were ‘uttered in
accents of pity, that we were too
blind to surrender a hopeless cause. Oar
commerce was suffering greatly by a few
aimed vessels built upon and famished from
foreign shores, and wc were threatened with
each additions from the same quarter as
would sweep our* trade from the sea.and'
raise the blockade. Wc had failed to elicit
from European govcmr.onts anything hope
ful upon this subject The preliminary eman
cipation proclamation, issued in September,
was running its assigned period to the begin
ning of the new. year. A month later the
final proclamation came, including the an
nouncement that colored men of suitable
condition would be received Into. the
war service. . The policy of emancipa
tion, and of employing black soldiers,
gave to the future a new aspect, about which
hope, and fear, and doubt contended iii un
certain conflict According to our political
system, os a matter of civil administration,
the general government had no lawful power
to effect emancipation in any State, and for a
long time it had beenhoped that the rebellion
could be suppressed without resorting to It
os a military measure. It was aU the while
deemed possible that the necessity for it
might come, and that if it should, the crisis
of the contest would then he presented. It
came, and, as was anticipated, it was followed
by dark and doifbtfal days. Eleven months
Imving now* passed, wc are permitted to
take aiiother review’. The rebel borders
arc pressed still further back, and by the
complete opening of the Mississippi the
country dominated by the rebellion is divid
ed into distinct parts, with no pmctldal com
munication between them. Tennessee and
Arkansas have been substantially cleared of
insurgent control, and influential citizens in
cadi, owners of slaves and advocates of
slavery at the beginning of the rebellion, now
declare openly for emancipation in their re
spective States. Of those States not included
in the emancipation proclamation, Maryland
and Missouri, neither of which three years
ego, would tolerate any restraint upon the
extension of slavery into new territories, on
ly now dispute as to the best mode of remov
ing it within their own limits.
Of those who were slaves at the beirinning
of the rebellion, folly one hundred tlTonsund
arc now' in the United States military service,
about one-half of which number actually
bear arms in the ranks, thus giving the doub
le advantage of taking so much labor from
the Insurgent cause, and supplying the places
which otherwise must be Hired with so many
white men. So far as tested, it is difficult to
say they are not as good soldiers as any.
h’o servile insurrection, or tendency to vio
lence or cruelty, has marked the measures of
emancipation and arming the blacks. These
measures have been much discussed in for
eign countries, and, contcznporaiy with such
discussion, the tone of public sentiment
there is much Improved. At home the same
mtasures have been fully discussed, sup
ported, criticised, and denounced, and the
annual elections following are highly en
couraging to those whose official duty It is to
hear the country through this , great trial.
Thus we have the new’ reckoning. The crisis
which threatened to divide the friends of the
Union is past
Lookingnow to the present and future, and
with reference to a resumption of the
national authority within the States
wherein that authority has been sus
pended, I have thought fit to issue a procla
mation, a copy of which is herewith trans
mitted. On examination of tills proclama
tion it will oppear, as ishtllevcd, that nothing
is attempted beyond what is amply justified
by the Constitution. True, the form of au
oath Is given, but no man is coerced to take
it. The man is only promised a pardon in
case he voluntarily takes the oath. The Con
stitution authorizeßi.be Executive to grant dr
withhold the pardon at h!s own absolute dis
cretion; and this Includes the power to grant
on terms, os is fully established by judicial
and other authorities.
It is also proffered that in any of the
States named, a Stats . government
shall be in the mode prescribed set up, such
government shall be recognised and guaran
teed by the United States, and that under it
the State shall, on the constitutional condi
tions, be protected against invasion and do
mestic violence. The constitutional obliga
tion of the United States to guarantee to ev
ery State in the Union a Kepnblican form of
government, and to protect the State, in the
cases stated, ’is explicit and fulL But
why tender the benelits of this provision
only to a State government set up in this
particular way? This section of the Consti
tution contemplates a case wherein the de
ment within aStatCjfavorable to republican
government, in the Union, may bs too feeble
lor an opposite and hostile element external
to, or even within the State; and such arc
precisely the cases with whleh vre are now
dealing.
An attempt to guaranty and protect a re
vived State Government constructed in-whole
oraprcponderatlng'part from the very ele
ment against whose hostility and violence it
is to be protected, is simplv absurd. There
must be a te r by which to separate
opposing elements so as to build only from
the sound; and that test is a sufficiently lib
eral one, which accepts as sound whoever will
make a sworn recantation ol his former un
soundness.
But if it be proper to require, as a test of
admission to the political body, aa oath, of
allegiance to the Constitution of the United
States, and to the Union under It, why also
to the laws and proclamations in regard to
slavery? Those laws and proclamations
were put forth for the purpose of aidins in
the suppression of the rebellion. To give
them their fullest effect, there had to be
-a pledge for their maintenance. In my judg
ment they have aided, and will farther aid,
the cause for which they were intended. To
now abandon them would be to not only re
linquish a lever of power, but would also be
a cruel and cn astonishing breach of faith. I
may add at this point, that 'while I remain iu
my present position I shall not attempt'
to* retract or modify the Emancipation
Proclamation; nor shall I return to Slav
erv any per son who is free by the tqrms of
of that proclamation, or by any of the acts of
Congress. For these, and other reasons, it is
thought best that support of these measures,.
sliall be included in the oath; and it is be
lieved the Executive may lawfully claim
it in return for pardon and restoration of
forfeited rights, which Uo-has * clear constitu
tional power to withhold altogether,
or grant upon the terms which he
shall deem wisest fof the public interest it
should be observed, also, that this part of the
oath is subject to Inc modifying and abroga
ting power of legislation and supreme judi
cial decision.
Tbe proposed acquiescence of tbc national
Executive in any reasonable temporary State
arrangement for the freed people is made with
tbc view of possibly modifying tbe confusion
and destitution winch must, at best, attend
all classes by a total -revolution of labor
throuffhout whole States. It is hoped that the
already deeply afflicted people in those
Statcsmay be somewhat more ready to give up
the cause of their affliction, if, to this extent,
this vital matter be left to themselves; while
no power of tbe National- Executive to pre
vent an abuse is abridged by tbc proposition.
The suggestion in the proclamation os to
maintaining tbe political frame-work of the
States on what is called reconstruction. Is
made in tbe hope that it may do good with
out danger of barm. It will save labor, ana
avoid great confusion.
But why any proclamation now npon this
subject? This question is beset with Hi e con-
Hiding views that tbe step might be delayed
too long or bo . taken too soon. In soma
States the elements for resumption seem
ready for adion, but remain inactive, appar
ently for watft of a rallying .point—a plan of
action. "Why shall A adopt tho plan
of,. B, rather than B that of A ?
And if A and B • should agree, bow
can they know but that tbe cen
■cral government here will reject their
plan? By the, proclamation a plan is pre
sented which may be accepted by them as a
rallying point, and which they arc assured in
advance will not be rejected here. Tim may
bring them to act sooner than they other
wise would.
The objections to a premature presenta
tion of a plan by tlie national Executive
consists In the danger of committals
on points which could be taorc safely
left to further developments. Care has
been taken to so shape the document
as to avoid embarrassments from this source.
Saving that, on certain terms, certain classes
wflTbe'pardoned, with rights restored, it Is
not said that other classes, or other terms,
will never be included. Saying that recon
struction will bo accepted ‘if presented in a
specified way, it is not said it will never be
accepted in any other way.
The movements, by State action, for eman
cipation in several of the States not included
in the Emancipation Proclamation, arc mat
ters of profound gratulation. And while I
do not repeat In detail what I have hereto
fore bo earnestly urged upon this subject, mv
general views and feelings remain unchanged;
and I trust that Congress will omit no fair
opportunity of .aiding* these Important steps
to a great consummation.
In the midst of other , cares, however im
portant, we must not lose sight of the fact
that Vte tear jxneerii'etUl our main reliance. To
that power alone can we look yet for a time to
give confidence to the people in the contested
regions, that the insurgent power will not
S* i overran them! Until that confidence
be established, little can be, done any
where for what is called Reconstruction.
Hence, our chicfcst care must still be direct
ed to the army and navy, who have thus
far borne their harder part bo nobly
and well. And it may be esteemed
fortunate that in giving the greatest effi
ciency to these Indispensable arms, we doeleo
honorably recognize the gallant men, from
commander to sentinel, who compose them,
and to whom, more than to others, the world
must stand indebted for the home of freedom
disenthralled, regenerated, enlarged and per
petuated. Abraham Lincoln.

PROCLAMATION.
Whereas, In and by the Constitution of
the United States, it is provided that the
President 4 ‘shall have power to grant reprieves
and pardons for offences against the United
Stoles, except in cases of impeachment;” and
Whereas, A rebellion now exists whereby
the loyal State governments of several
States have for a long time been sub
verted, and many persons have committed
and are now guilty of treason against the
United States; and
. Whereas, With reference to said rebellion
and treasqur laws have been enacted by
Congress, declaring ’ forfeitures and con
fiscation of property and liberation of slaves;
all upon terms and conditions therein sta
ted, and also declaring that-the President’
was thereby authorized at any time there
after, by proclamation, to .’extend to persons
who may have participated In the existing
rebellion, in any State or part thereof, -par
don and amnesty, with such exceptions and
at such times and on such conditions as he
may deem expedient for the public welfare;
and / •
■Whereas, The congressional declaration for
limited and conditional pardon accords with
well established judicial exposition : of the
r-ardoningpower; and . ’;
Whereas, With reference to said rebellion,
the President of tbe United States has
issued several proclamations, with provis- ‘
ions in regard to the liberation of slaves; and,
Wrebeas, It is now desired by some per
sons heretofore engaged in said rebellion to
resume thdr allegiance to the United States,
to rcinaugnrate loyal State Governments
within and for. their respective States,
therefore,
I, Abraham Lincoln, President of
the United States, do proclaim, declare,
and make known to all persons who have
directly, or.by Implication, participated in
the existing rebellion, except os hereinafter
excepted, that a full pardon is .heeedt
granted to them, and: each of them, with
restoration of all rights of property, except
as to slaves, and in propertv cases where
rights of third .parties shall have inter
vened, and upon the condition that every
etxch person shall toko and subscribe au
oath, and thenceforward keep and main
tain said oath inviolate; and which oath
shall be registered for permanent
preservation, and shall be of 1 the
tenor and effect following to-wit:
THE OATH.
“I, , do solemnly swear, in presence
of Almighty God, that I will henceforth faith
fully support* protect and defend the Con
stitution of the United States, and the union
of the States thereunder; and that I will, in
like manner* abide by and faithfully support
all acts of Congress passed daring the exist
ing rebellion ’with reference to slaves, so long
and so far as not repealed, modified or hold,
void by Congress, or by decision of the Su
preme Court; and that I will, In like man
ner, abide by and faithfully support all proc
lamations of the President mode during the
existing rebellion having reference to slaves,
so long and so fiir as not modified or declared
void by decision of the Supreme Court. So
help me God.”
The person excepted from the benefits of
the foregoing provisions are all who ore, or
ehnll have been, civil or diplomatic officers
or agents of the so-called confederate gov
ernment; all who have left judicial stations
under the United States to aid the rebellion;
all who are. or shall have been, military or
naval officers of said so-called confederate
government above the rank of colonel In the
army, or of lieutenant in the navy; all who
have left seats in the United States Congress
to aid the rebellion; all who resigned com
missions in the army or navy of the United
States, and afterwards aided the rebellion;
and all who have engaged, in any way in treat
ing colored persons, or white persons in
charge of such, otherwise than lawfully as
prisoners of war, and which persons may
have been found-in the United States service
as soldiers, seamen, or in any other capacity.
And I do furtherproclahn, declare and make
known, that whenever, in any of the States of
Arkansas, Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi,
Tennessee, Alabama, Georgia, Florida, South
Carolina and North Carolina, a number of
persons, not less than one-tenth in num
»her of the votes cast in such State at the
Presidential election of the year of our Lord
one thousand eight hundred and sixty,
cadi having, taken the oath 'aforesaid,
and not having since.violated it, and being a
qualified voter by the election law of the State
existing immediately before the so-called act
of secession, and excluding all others, shall
re-establish a State Government which shall
be republican, and in no wise contravening
said oath, such shall be recognized as the
true Government of the State, and
the State shall' receive there
under the benefits of the constitutional pro
vision which declares that •* The United States
shall guarantee to every State in this Union a
republican-form of government, and shall
protect each of them against invasion; and, on
application of the Legislature, or the Execu
tive, (when the Legislature cannot be con
vened,) against domestic violence.*.’
And I do further proclaim, declare
and moke known, that any provision which
may be adopted by such State Government,
in relation to the freed people of such Stale
which shall recognize and declare their per
manent freedom, provide for their educa
tion, and which may yet be v consistent ns a
temporary arrangement with thdr present
condition as a laboring, landless and home
less class, will not be objected to by the Na
tional Executive. And it Is suggested os not
improper, • that in constructing a - ioval
State Government in any Side, the name'of
the State, the boundary, the subdivisions, the
Constitution and the general code of laws, as
before the rebellion, oe maintained, subject
only to the modifications made necessary by
the conditions hereinbefore stated, and such
others if any, not contravening said conditions
and which may be deemed expedient by those
framing the new State Government.
To avoid misunderstanding* it may be
proper to say that this proclamation, so far
as it relates to State governments, has no ref
erence to States wherein loyal State govern
ments have all the while been maintained.
And for the same reason it may bo proper
furthertosay, that whether members sent to
Congress from any State shall be admitted to
seats, constitutionally rests exclusively with
the respective Houses, and not to
any. extent with the Executive, And
still further, that- this proclamation
is intended ,to present the people of the
Slates wherein the national authority has
been suspended, and loyal State governments
have been subverted, d mode in and by which
the national authority and loyal State gov
ernments may be re-established within said
States, or in any of them; and while the mode
presented is'the best the Executive can sug
gest, with his present Impressions, Itmnstuot
be understood that no other possible mode
would be acceptable.

INTERNAL REVENUE—REPORT
OF COMMISSIONER LEWIS.
Operation of (lie Tax Law-rlmf*
portant Suggestions and
Recommendations.
The Commissioner of Internal Revenue re
marks, iu beginning his annual report, that
the present tux laws have been favorably re
ceived by the people, and have added to the
revennebf the nation, if not so much as was
anticipated at the time of their passage, yet
enough to improve largely the credit of the
Government, and to demonstrate the im
mense resources it possesses yet untouched,
in the loyalty and growing wealth of the peo
ple.
No sudden or violent change In the system
of taxation devised by Congress appears to
be necessary. On the contrary, it is believed
that its capacity to produce revenue is not
fully indicated by the receipts hitherto ob
tained. Not only are the productive proper
ty and the industry of the couutir, which are
the great sources of the revenue, rapidly
growing, but the administration of the laws
is improving constantly, and is believed,
with the aid of Congress, to be susceptible
of such further Improvements as will ma
terially add to the revenue. Every advance
iu this direction is a manifest gain both to
the Government and the community; for it
tends to equalize hardens, to discourage
frauds and irregular speculations, and to en
courage honest industry and legitimate traf
fic, while indirectly increases the returns to
the Treasmy. Commissioner Lewis therefore
refrains from suggesting any radical changes,
but proposes such specific alterations as seem ■
to be necessary in order to enable the Gov
ernment to sustain its financial credit by the
payment of Interest on the accumulating
debt incident to the prolongation of the wan
RECEIPTS.
The actual receipts of the internal revenue
office from all sources, between (September
3Ctb, 1802, and June SOth, 18CS, were $36,586,-
304.&); and up to September Ist, 1863, they
were $7,483,473.03. up'to June SO, the draw
backs amounted to $670,683.73, and up to
September 1, $503,060.36. At each of these
dates, however, there were considerable sums
in the hands of collectors, and the annual
taxes, including those on Incomes, had been
oßly partially received. To say with accura
cy now much the excise laws have yielded
within a given period, is not-practicable.
Tbcir operation is continuous and the ma
chinery is constantly active. There are hard
ly ever in the malls less than half a million
of dollars, including checks,.drafts and cerV
lificutes of deposit, to the credit of this
office, in transitu. The estimate of the pro
duct of the taxes assessed within the year
ending on the first day of September last, is
slxty-llvc millions of dollars.
The Commissioner says:
• ** If the law should remain untouched,-ex
perience in its administration will enable the
officers Laving charge of the subject to make
the yield larger and the expense of collection
less;-andtlieincrease in the production of
the countiy, owing to the activity of trade
and industry, will operate in the same direc
tion. I attribute to tjiese causes on addition
to the internal revenue of another year of not
lees than ten millions of dollars. If we add
to this the probable results from the meas
ures suggested in relation to spirituous; via*
ous ana malt liquors, and to tobacco, In caso
of their immediate adoption, the internal rev*
.enne for the year 1864, reckoned from Janua
ry to December, both months included, will
reach the sum of ninety-two millions,
without taking Into calculation anything
likely to come from districts now insurrec
tionary.”
LIFE INSURANCE COMPANIES.
*. The Commissioner holds that the dividends
'Of life insulate companies should be ex
empted from Che payment of the income tax,
but proposes to make a partial compensation
to the Treasury by incrcasingthc stamp duty
now required upon policies of life insurance.
The report says:
: ’ “It fe believed that a stamp onevoiypoll
or emolument of like effect, of fifty cents
for each one thousand dollars of the amount
insured, may be levied without oppressing
tbc companies or discouraging the demand
for insurance. lit should also be remarked
that lifo Insurance companies which are not
purely mutual, butwhich have a capital stock
invested in them for the sake of revenue,
should'obviously be. taxed upon the revenue
in the some proportion as the gains and profits
of any other business.”.
TAXr-S*OPON LIQUORS.
: i An increase of the tax upon distilled spir
its to sixty cents a gallon Is recommended.
It is also suggested that a tax upon malt of
thirty cents a bushel be imposed, but should
it be deemed advisable to continue tbc ex
ception of malt, and tax, only the liquor pro-‘
duccd by it, It seems certain that the revenue
micht be considerably increased by a judicious
enlargement of the tax, say to one dollar and
fifty cents per barrcL 1 ’ •
PETROLEUM.
Certain provisions of the present law which
relate to petroleum have occasioned embar
rassment and require revision to moke them
more simple and efficient. The Commission-,
er condemns, the. drawback allowed bv sec
tion lIS as ft direct discrimination against
tbe people of this country, and. In favor of
nil other nations, in supplying which' nature
has given us almost a monopoly, and recoin-’
mends its repeal. .
TOBACCO.
Kcgardiug tobacco os purely a luxury, and
in noway a necessary of’life,, the Commis
eioner recommends a large increase of the
taxnpoutt. Heeays:
“Tills year, notwithstanding the extensive
planting in the Northern and Middle States,
the crop Is estimated, in the last report of
the Agricultural bureau, at only two hundred
and fifty-eight millions: being still one
hundred ana seventy millions 01pounds less -
than in -18C0. While the domestic produc
tion is thus diminished, the foreign demand
has been constantly increasing,; and Itwll
not be likely to bo seriously nfl'cctcd by the
difference In price- which its exportation,
subject to our excise on tho raw mate
vial, will occasion. I, therefore, beg leave
to submit tbe proposition that tobacco be
taxed in the leaf in tho hands of the
producer, and that no drawback be allow
ed on its exportation in that shape; so that
the cost to the foreign manufacturer may be
increased to the extent of our excise. If
any drawback is to be allowed, the proper
policy of encouraging and sustaining onr own
manufacturers against adverse legislation of
a foreign Government, seems to require that
it shall'be allowed, if at nil, only on the man
ufactured article. The extent to which the
allowance should go Is a question of some
nicety. The tax on tobacco in the leaf, with
oil the stems on. might, I think, be fixed
with advantage to the revenue, and without
Injury to the producer, at twcnty'ccnts per
pound. A light tax, varying from five to ten
or twelve cents per pound additional, might
be imposed.on the manufactured commodi
ty. 4 drawback on this from ten to fifteen
cents would give to the domestic manufactu
rer all the advantages he would desire iu tbe
foreign market, and would, in some meas
ure, countervail the legislation of foreign
nations to his prejudice.”
WINES.
The use of wines and the tax upon them
ore thus treated in the report: .
4 ‘The cultivation of the grape and the
manufacture of wino in this country is still
in an infant state, a*d good policy would
seem to require that they be encouraged.
Though the experience of Europe has shown
that the .consumption of spirits is not re
duced by high rates of duties, it may be-ln
some respects owing to the fact that cheap
wines ore not furnished to the consumer. If
cheap, mild wine should be made to super
sede spirits as the common liquor of the
million, the result would be gratifying both
In a moral and Industrial point of view,
and any modification of the excise tend
ing in that direction would be desira
ble. I apprehend, however, that the tax
on spirits must ascend to a much higher
figure than fees yet been proposed, before any
appreciable effect will bo produced in deter
mining the choice of liquors on the part of
those who habitually drink them, and that at
all events, in the present needs of the country
for increased revenue, a duty of ten cents
per gallon on native wines, will not be sc-,
verely felt or deemed unreasonable. These
changes in the amount of duty to be laid on
spirituous, vinous and malt liquors seem to
be suggested by common experience and the
policy which obtains in every well-poised
system of taxation. They belong to a class
of luxuries which may be properly denomi
nated hurtful, and, if the consumption should
happen to be Affected by the weight of the
taxes, the result would not be without com
pensation to the consumer and the country.
The duties arc now very* low, in view
of the modes of using the subjects of
them. Twenty cents - a gallon is bat one
cent and a quarter a half pint—a quantity
usually sufficient, I presume, for one day’s
allowance for a moderate drinker. .Three
times that tax wopld not be sensibly felt, in
a proportionable increase of price. If it
would exert any influence on consumption,
it would be In favor of the cheaper liquors,
which, for that reason, could then better bear
some additional duty.
“ If in making your estimates of the needs
of the Government, it should be found that
no considerable increase in the amount de
rived from internal duties is desired, I
should think it a question worthy of con
sideration whether some increase of tax on
all hurtful luxuries, including even tobacco,
would not be eligible, so that relief might
be afforded to those interests that produce
the common necessaries of life. If an in
crease of the tax on certain products of
which the use Is purely voluntary, and lit
the same time at least useless, would be at-.
tended by a diminution of tax on" such,
commodities ns contribute to the support,'
comfort or enjoyment of the community, the
propriety of the change would seem to bo ob
vious. But if a large revenue Is wanted to
aid iu sustaining the national credit and sup
plying means for the large expenditures inci
dent to the war, the reason for the change
would become invincible.”
MINERAL WATERS, &C.
It Is proposed to levy the following taxes,
upon artificial mineral waters, spda waters,
sarsaparilla waters, and other beverages of
like kind usually sold in bottles—two cents
per dozen of bottles holding a half pint or
less: and when sold in bottles of greater ca
pacity, four cents per dozen for each ’dozen
of bottles holding a pint or less; and when
sold iu bottles ot still greater capacity than a
pint, one cent per bottle. When sold In any
■ other way, a duty of five per cent. <u/ ratoivm,
TAXING LUXURIES.
A taxjipou tho following.articles is recom
mended! .
Gold watches, pianos, guitars, .dogs, look
ing glasses beyond a certain size, diamonds,
emeralds, and other precious stones, kept for
ornament or use. :
COTTON.
Cotton Is now subjected to a dntv of ouc
balf of one cent per pound. Quadruple the'
tax will not, in the Commissioner’s opinion,
Ins excessive. So insignificant a sum can be
added to the price in me foreign market with
out affecting tbc demand or exciting danger
ous competition. Thread and yanTinanafiic
tured ami sold, or delivered for being knit or
■woven into fabrics, may properly be made
‘subject to three per cent, ad
same as If such thread or yarn were sold in
the market.
INCREASE OF OTHER TAXES. ,
Boards planed, tongued and grooved. shin
gles, bricks, Roman cement, calcined plaster,
draining tiles, dressed building stone, print
ers’ ink, maps, charts, periodical publica
tions,’other than newspapers, and engravers’,
work, would bear an ad valorem duty.
The tax on auction sales is now very low,
and will bear to be increased probably to
one-fourth of one per cent.
The tax on slaughtered animals may bo ad
vantageously adjusted on n somewhat differ
ent scale without becoming onerous, viz: on
each head of homed cattle, more than eight
weeks old, slaughtered for sale, a tax of thir
ty cents;-and on calves of* eight weeks old
and less, a tax of tire cents per head. On
slaughtered swine, exceeding fifty pounds iu
weight, ten cents per head.
MANUFACTURED ARTICLES.
An amendment of that part of tbc law
which relates to the taxation of manufac
tured articles is recommended. The report
says:
“A number of railroad companies, and
other-large operators, who manufacture loco*
motive engines, railroad cars, paper forprint
iug, and many other articles consumed by
them in the prosecution of their business,
embracing, in the aggregate, the value of
millions, have insisted that the - sis hundred
dollar limitation has application only to
manufactures that arc-sold, not to.those.con.
snmed by tbe manufacturers themselves;
and that construction has been adopted in
several litigated coses. Though it may be .
in accordance with the legal intent of the
statute, I cannot believe that it was contem
plated by Congress to give to large corpora
tions the privilege of carrying on extensive
manufactures ot wood, iron and other mate
rials, without the payment of a duty, because
they happen to bo such extensive consumers
as to make the business of manufacturing for
themselves profitable. It is not consistent
with the general spirit of the legislation of
that honorable body to discriminate in favor
of corporate institutions or private iirms
wielding enormous capital, to- the prejudice
of small manufacturers, and to the aggrega
tion, Instead of the dilfosian of capital, and
the healthy condition of trade produced by
active competition. -I therefore beg leave to
suggest: the propriety of so amending the
law as to make it answty plainly the original
intent. This,- I submit, may be done', by re
quiring that all productions or manufactures
used or consumed by the producers or man
ufacturers thereof,-being articles of commer
cial value, and which-would be taxable if
eold, shall be. in like manner, taxable when
used or consumed.”. - .
hie escoue tat.
, On this Important subject the Commission
er makes the following observations;:' ■
u I suggest that the income tax be left un
tocchcd, except in a few slight particulars..
This tax, thongh as fair in theory os any that'
can he laid, has been found by the experience
of other countries to bo encumbered with
E radical difficulties in theassessments which
avc deprived It of-all claims to public favor.
The people of this country have accepted it
with cheerfulness, to meet a temporary exi
gency, and it' has excited no serious com
plaint in its administration; In order that it
might not be felt to be inquisitorial in its
character, the instructions issued by this
office required that the returns of income
shall not be open to the inspection of others
than officers of the revenue. Some doubt
having been entertained wbethcr a
proper construction of the law sustains the
instructions, I recommend that the doubt
be removed by express enactment. It will,
• I think, contribute to fairness If the provi
sion allowing.a deduction ,|br rent paid for
dwelling houses be stricken from the law,
and that owners of such bouses, residing in
them, be charged with their rental value os
Income. It seems to me, also, that a change.
in the rate oflaige incomes may he properly
mode, subjecting incomes over five thousand
dollars (55,000) and less than ten thousand
dollars ($10,000) in amount to fonr per cent,
tax, and those .over ten thousand dollars
($10,000) and less than twenty thousand ($30,-
OCO to five per cent, and those exceeding
twenty thousand dollars ($20,000) to five, and
a half or six per cent Tne English rate is
now over fonr per cent, in time of peace,
end during the Kussian war it was upwards
of five ana eight-tenths per cent, on all in
comes over“j£lso.. If the English people
could tolerate, without'murmuring, such a
tax to sustain’a war ’of conquest and ambi
tion, American citizens will certainly endure
a lighter one for union and freedom.
. “ There is a class of persons subject to the
assessment of the income tax who claim ex
emption on .peculiar, grounds. I allude'to
the subjects of foreign Governments repre
senting themlierc as consular;agents. Mirny
of these people .arc obliged to pay a tax
upon the salaries which they receive from
the home governments for their official ser
vices, and complaint is made, with some
reason, that a double tax charged upon
the same source is unduly severe. In
some countries it appears that American
consuls are obliged to pay taxes on their in
comes however derived, while in others no
such tax is exacted. I submit the consider
ation whether the same measure of liberal
courtesy might uot be extended to tbe sub
jects of foreign Governments serving as con
suls In onr ports, as are extended oy those
Governments to American citizens serving
abroad in a consular.capacity. -We have suf
ficient information iu the office to enable us
to make the proper discrimination.. The In
equality, if any should exist, will be attrib
uted to the proper cause, and those who suf
fer by It will know, where to apply for the
remedy.”J • -
STAMP DUTIES ON DOCUMENTS.
Mtie proposed to levy duty npon receipts
for the payment of money, equal to one-half
the duty now required on checks and sight
drafts. The following additional sources ol
revenue are also Indicated;
44 Assignments and transfers of personal
property other than Instruments of evidence
now provided for, by any writing, such os aa
slgnmcnts in trust deeds, for the benefit of
creditors or others; bills of sale and docu
ments of like nature* Indentures of appren
ticeship, articles of partnership, attested cop-*
ies of instruments made evidence by law,
warrants of distress, writs of execution, let
ters of patent for inventions, leases of per
sonal property; certificates of copy-right,
commissioners appointing persons to offices,
certificates of admission of attorneys or coun
sellors to practice law, diplomas of medical
schools, colleges and universities, certifi
cates of marriage, and all written or printed
instruments not otherwise provided for, when
offered in evidence on the trial or hearing of
any civil case at law before any court or judi
cial magistrate.”
VARIOUS RECOMMENDATIONS.
The Comralesloneradds these recommenda
tions :
44 1 respectfully recommend that the stamp
duty on promissory notes, inland bills,
drafts and orders, and also mortgages and
personal bonds for the payment oi certain
sums of money, be doubled, and that the
maximum of those to be required In any case
bo also doubled; that the stamp duties on
agreements. or contacts other than those
Specified in the schedule be ten cents; that
the. words 4 exceeding twenty dollars* be
stricken from the danse in schedule B rela
ting to bank checks, drafts or orders, and
also from the first paragraph of the sixth sec
tion of Hie amendatory act; that the stamp
duties on life, marine and inland insurance
policies be doubled; that those on leases be
proportioned to the rent reserved and the
length of the term; that no,letters of
attorney to do single acts, such as enter satis
faction on a judgment or mortgage, execute
a paper or document other than a convey
ance, serve a notice or process to*appear to a
suit or action, to receive prize money or
wages of labor, be assigned a moderate duty
more appropriate to the nature of the ser
vice to be performed than that now provided;
and that writs, summonses, and other pro
cesses for the commencement*of actions be
fore justices of the peace, in ease of civil
jurisdiction, and writs of execution, also
issued by snch justices for the seizure or sale
of goods, be mjide subjet to a small stamp
duty.**
. The report recommends a tax upon the ton
nage receipts of railroad and steamboat com
panies, and upon the dividends of telegraph
companies; he also recommends a taxof two
and one-fifth per cent instead of onepcrccnt.
on the circulation of banks, of one-fifth of
one per cent on deposits,, instead of one
eighth; ami of one-twentieth of one percent,
on sales at brokers* boards. The Commis
sioner says:
“The extension proposed to be given to
the system of internal revenue, and the addi
tional drafts«on the producing sources above
suggested, in view of the increasing wants of
the Government, cannot be fairly expected to
yield the amount of one hundred and fifty
millions of dollars, which, as 1 have already
stated, was the estimate reported to you by
this office iu December last. If, therefore, it
shall be deemed necessary to.obtain by Inter
nal daties the last named sum, recourse
must be had to some other quarter, in addi
tional taxes imposed on products which en
ter largely into consumption. A tax of two
per cent, additional on the general manu
lectures of the country would, I think, pro
duce the required sum—probably a few mil
lions more. In making the estimate, some
allowance must be njado for reduced con
sumption, caused by the increased economy
•In the use, incident to increased taxes.
Doubling duties on necessaries will not
double the revenue, and the proportion of
the receipts to the rate will he less than in
the ease of such luxuries as arc used in grat
ifying the appetites. Consideration has been
•given to common experience on this point,
and due allowance made for it.”
TJtc report concludes with suggestions of
amendments to the Excise law, designed to
increase Its efficiency. Among these sug
gcsllons is one looking to thfc facilitation of
collections, as follows: , , _
“As a means of facilitating such collec
tions, and affording the United States and
citizens alike an opportunity of having their
respective rights in all internal revenue eases
quickly and cheaply adjusted, 1 beg leave to
suggest whether it will not be expedient to
confer civil jurisdiction on commissioners,
appointed or to be appointed by the
Circuit Courts, where the sum in contro
versy does not exceed a certain limit to be
named in the laws, and I should think that
limit may be safely fixed at two hundred
and fifty or three hundred dollars.' Right of
jury trial may be secured by making provis
ion for appeal. As a condition annexed to
the benefit of appeal, security for costs may
be required of anf oilier party than the Uni
ted States. A tribunal of the kindsnggested,
making justice under tho internal revenue
laws rapid in movement and small in expense,
would probably be found to be peculiarly ac
ceptable to the citizen as well os useful to the
Government.”

FROM BET. 7. JCBWTO2T OBOWW, J). D., EDITOR OF ' rrr *
ENCYCLOPEDIA OF BEUOIOCB KEOWZOOE.
Although not disposed to Ctvoc or recommend pat
ent medicines in general, through distrust Of their In
gredients and effects, I yet know of no sufficient rea
sons why a man may not testify to the benetltshs be
lieves himself to have received from auy simple pre
paration, in the hope that be may thus contribute to
the benefit of others.
I do this more readily la regard to Hoofland’s 6cr*
man Bitters, prepared by Dr. C. if. Jackson, of this
city, because X was prejudiced against them for many
years, under the Impression that they were chiefly on
alcoholic mixture. lam indebted to my friend Robt.
Shoemaker, Zsn., for the removal ofthls prejudice by
proper teats and for encouragement to try them when
bcfluring from great and Jodk continued debility. The
u-eofinreebottlesofthese the beginning
of the present year, was followfld by evident relief and
restoration to a decrec*of bodily and mental
which 1 had cot felt lor six months before, and hadah
most dlsnaircd of regaining. I therefore thank God
and my friend for directing me tatho n*e of them*

ATTENTION, SOLDIERS!
And the Friends of Soldiers.
We call* the attention of all having relations or
friends in the army, to the fact that •* Hooiland’s Ger
man Bitters’* will cure nine-tenths of the diseases in
duced by exposure and privations incident to camp
life. In the lists published almost dally in the newspa
pers on the arrival of the sick, it wilt be noticed that a
very large proportion arc snlfcrlng from great and long
continued dcbllltv. Every case of that kind can be
nadlly cared by Hoohand's German Bitters. We have
no hesitation In stating that if the»o Bitters were freely
a?cd among our soldiers, hundreds of lives might be
saved that otherwise would bo lost.
The proprietors arc dally receiving thankful letters
from sufferers in the army and hospitals, who have
been restored to health by the use of these Bitters,
sent to them by their friends.
