THE STORY OF WX. M. TWEED,
A Plain Narration of His Life and the Rise
and Fall of the Famous Ring.
Twelve years, ia the ipenitentiary at Black
welPs Island and a fine of $12,750. This was
the penalty pronounced against William M.
Tweed, in the Court of Qy-cr and Terminer, by
Judge Noah Davis, on Saturday afternoon. At
1 o'clock on Sunday morning the prisoner was
taken to the Tombs,.and. in that Egyptian pile
of .more than Egyptian misery he is now con?
fined/ The last act of the drama is played.
The man who a little while ago was a senator,
a supervisor, a commissioner?-the chief power
an the chief city of the continent?is now a
condemned convict If any measure of suc?
cess attends the efforts of his, counsel to secure
a mitigation of sentence, a stay of proceedings,
or a new. trial, it will not alter the essential
feet phat Tweed's place henceforth is with the
outlaws of society. It is time to consider the
man's life and character with the-same calm,
dispassionate view that we shonld take of the
dead, for Tweed is dead beyond the hope of
resurrection.
.^LYfilliam M. Tweed was born in the city of
New York fifty years ago last April. His pa?
rents were .poor people, and the boy was early
thrownupon his own resources. He learned
the-trade of a chair-maker, and worked at it
for a few year3-. He soon became ambitious of
political distinction, and to increase his quali?
fications and improve his chances he entered
the University Law School, from which he
graduated as a member of the bar. His power
Began in the old volunteer fire departmcut of
the metropolis. He became foreman of "Big
Six"?an engine company famous in the lower
part of the city. His immense vital energy
and his organizing ability were here developed
and exhibited. In that day a popular fireman
Was. "positive power in local politics, and Tweed,
began to make himself felt
In 1851 he was elected alderman from the
Seventh ward, serving in the Common Council
through the years 1852-'53. In the fall of
1852 he was elected to Congress from the fifth
district, which then embraced the Sereuth and
l^nrteeuth wards of New York and the village
of Williamsburgh, L. I. He took his seat in
the Housein December, 1853i white his term
as alderman was about expiring. He was thir?
ty years old at that time-, with the promise of a
?r future before him. While in Congress he
was elected school commissioner of the Seventh
ward. The year after his term as representa?
tive expired" he was chosen Nto the board of su?
pervisors, and continued to hold a place there
until the day of his overthrow.
In 1861 he was candidate for Sheriff on the
Tammany ticket' The office is one of enor?
mous emolument, and Tweed struck for it with
his usual energy. He reckoned himself worth
$80,000 at that time, and he had made the
money honestly. He expended the last dollar
of it iu the canvass, led on by the hope aud
belief that he would triumph. He was beaten,
arid during the winter winch followed he found
great 'difficulty in meeting the house-rent and
paying his butcher's and grocer's bills. It is
probable that his career as a public plunderer
dates from the day of his defeat as sheriff.
He'was not a fine-grained man nor troubled
with -many conscientious scruples. He saw
tumself as the victim of what he looked upon
a3 a conspiracy. He had distributed his money
..among various ward organizations in return for
their promised assistance. They divided his
fortune and withheld their support He re?
solved to* "get even" with the public, who had
preferred another to him, and ne set about the
job with the coolness, of a great general and I
the wickedness of a great robber. In 1862 he
became deputy street commissioner, and while
holding that office he got his hand freely into
. the public purse for the first time. At about
the same period he made himself the leading
spirirln the Tammany organization.
He showed soojLthat his power as an organ?
izer was very great He drew men around him
usually by appealing to their selfish natures.
T?'orie he'gave money to another, some place
honor and trust He proceeded on the the?
ory that every man had his price. If a rival
arose to dispute his authority he crushed that
rival if he could, and if he couldn't he crushed
;the rivalry by supporting the man for some
office and thus making, him his ally. In this
way he spiked the guns of Fernando Wood,
and called a truce with, his popular enemy, the
"Bi? Judge," jaitchaeX Connolly.
In 1867, Richard B. Connolly, a timid man,
plausible in manners but exceedingly corrupt
at heart, became controller, of New York.
?rVlth him Tweed formed an alliance. Connol?
ly was greedy and close-fisted. He never
could secure a popular following. He held
office at the pleasure of Tweed, who was, how?
ever, compelled to share equally with him in
the division of the money plundered from the
city. That same year (1867) Tweed was elect?
ed to the State Senate from the Fourth district
by a large majority. In the Senate he found a
majority opposed to him politically. How he
used that majority to effect his purpose is one
of the chronicles of Albany which is vet to be
written, We may undertake the task hereaf?
ter.
In 1869 Tweed found a counsellor far wiser
and much more honest than himself in the
person of Feter B. Sweeney. He also found a
flippant but brilliant advocate in A. Oakey
- Hall, a man free from corrupt motives, but one
willing.to blind his eyes to the crimes commit?
ted around him as a reward for temporal power
and pleasant notoriety. When these four men
?Tweed, Connolly, Sweeney and Hall?joined
their various forces and talents the Tammany
conspiracy was complete. In 1870 the first
revolt-against this concentrated power began.
It was badly planned and disreputably officered.
Norton, Genet, Creamer, Peter Mitchell, Mi?
chael JIurphey, and othera who led the move?
ment in the Legislature, were not the men
through whom reform could come.
It looked for a time, however, as if the move?
ment would succeed. Tweed was beaten in the
preliminary skirmish in the Senate. He pre?
tended to surrender, and voted for the charter
of the Young Democracy. Bnt he had secretly
formed an alliance with the Republican party
in the Legislature and could afford to bide this
time. Meantime his rivals had lost their
heads. In the flush of temporary success they
divided?on paper?all the offices in the city
amongst themsel ves. The charter under which
this grand distribution was to take place was
taken to the Assembly, where it was understood
that it would pass by general consent; but to
the amazement of many, and to the dismay of
the Young Democracy, it was defeated,
Tweed's rivals surrendered at discretion.
Creamer, Norton, Mitchell?all but Genet?
sued for terms of peace. The next week
Tweed's charter was iutroduced, and receiving
the support of all the Republican senators ex?
cepting Thayer, of Reunselaer, it passed.
"Tub was followed by other measures which
made the power of the ring well-nigh absolute.
It was then that the system of plunder began
to work out its amazing results. Bills of the
city were deliberately raised from $50,000 to
$500,000, aud the enormous excess divided be
tween Connolly and Tweed, who in turn shared
part of the money with subordinate strikers.
Hall looked on and held his peace. Sweeney
put forth an effort to stop the stealing, but was
overborne. The accounts of the c mtroller's
office were secreted, and the general public, as
well as the Democratic party, were hoodwinked
and misled.
Among those who sought to profit in the
general carnival of fraud was James O'Brien,
Who, as Sheriff of New York, had received
upward of $300,000 for three years' service
After retiring from office he cooked up a bogus
claim aggregating $200,000 and demanded its
payment. The Board of Audit refused to
consider it, although Tweed espoused O'Brien's
bad cause. To strengthen his chances ot get
?ting the money, O'Brien placed a confidential
clerk in the controller's office and secured
transcripts of the fraudulent vouchers therein ;
contained. Armed with these evidences of the
fnilt of his former comrades, he again deman
ed his plunder. It was again refused. The
ring bad grown so bold and they felt that their
lease of power was so long and strong that they
could brave any exposure. j
Thereupon O'Brien turned his evidence over
to the New York Times, and that paper pub?
lished it. The effect was startling, with one
voice the people demanded the punishment of
these men who had betrayed so great a trust.
They were thrust out of the Democratic party,
whose temple they had defiled. - Said Judge
Davis in sentencing Tweed : "O'Connor, who
has been named here, and who holds the fore?
most rank in his profession, and who stands
without a stain upon a character as pure' and
noble as any man's in this great city, immedi?
ately from his semi-retirement came and aided
in the rescue of this city from its great corrup?
tion. And Tilden, who stood as the leading
man at the head of the Democratic State Corn
mitte of this State, devoted weeks and months
of toil in ferreting out these crimes, in ascer?
taining from these bank accounts what had
been done, till he was able to lay before us the
other day on the trial the result, crystalline in
its simplicity, and so clear that no man could
fail to read its meaning."
Against a feeling of wrath which was uni?
versal Tweed opposed the power of his ill-got?
ten wealth. He doubtless oelieved that no ju?
ry could be found to convict him. His courage
did not forsake him. While Connolly slunk
away to other lands to avoid punishment,
Tweed stayed and fought it out. How the
fight ended is told in the heavy sentence passed
upon the great public plunderer.
The Atlanta Convention of Farmers.
The Patrons of Husbandry and representa-1
tives of Agricultural Societies throughout the
Cotton States met in Atlanta, Ga., on Tuesday,
25th of November. The session lasted two
days, and was harmonious and enthusiastic.
About one hundred and fifty delegates were
present, when the meeting was called to order,
and Rev. D. E. Butler was chosen temporary
chairman, and J. J. Toon as temporary secre?
tary. The afternoon proceedings were devoted
to a discussion of the question of direct trade.
Several speeches were made, and among them
some that were very interesting.
In the evening the permanent officers were
chosen as follows:
President?D. E. Butler, of Georgia.
Vice Presidents?Dr. H. R. Cook, of South
Carolina; S. J. Harrington, of Alabama; L.
Russell, of Tennessee; M. F. Berry, Mississip?
pi ; and G. W. Evans, Georgia.
Secretary?J. D. Waddell; J. J. Toon and
E. Heyser, Assistants.
The Committee on Business reported as fol?
lows, which was adopted:
Resolved, That it is the policy of cotton
planters to utilize the value of cotton as much
as practicable, first to manufacturing as large a
portion as possible of the staple and the bal?
ance to sell direct to the manufacturer.
Resolved, That we recognize the moral obli?
gation and wise policy of employing all practi?
cable means to cancel existing debts, and that
th*e creditor manifest forbearance, and that
the debtor exhaust all available resources to
respoud to the claims upon him.
Resolved; That we advise cotton planters now
embarrassed with debt to seek the most favora ?
ble terms with their creditors as to the sale of
their cotton.
Resolved, That we respectfully request our
representatives in Congress to have the cotton
tax refunded, and that it be paid to the produ?
cer.
The following resolution was likewise adop?
ted:
Resolved, That this convention, through its
president, do petition Congress to so modify
the existing patent laws at t!;.;ir approaching
session, as hereafter to require all articles cov?
ered by a renewal of patent to be sold by the
patentee at not more than twenty-five per cent,
above cost of manufacturing.
On Wednesday, the Business Committee
made the following report, which was adop?
ted:
Whereas, the Southern States possess vast
mines of coal and iron, for need of proper de?
velopment are now useless, and consequently
valueless; and whereas, the miner must be fed
and clothed as well as the manufacturer, ren?
dering the farmer, the manufacturer and the
miner mutually dependent on each other, and
every aid giveu to one of these branches of in?
dustry is mutual in its benefits; therefore,
Resolved, That we look upon the develop?
ment of the coal and iron interests of our sec?
tions as a matter demanding not only the at?
tention of the capitalist and financier, but of
every man in our section who desires our
future prosperity and advancement.
Whereas, it is a well established fact that
the surplus products of all descriptions are
valueless to us without a market, and that to
secure a profitable market cheap transporta?
tion is of prime importance to the prosperity
not only of the agricultural, but of the com?
mercial, manufacturing and mining interests
of the country; and whereas, our present means
of reaching market are inadequate to.our wants
and the need of the country.
Resolved, That cheap transportation is of the
first importance to the country, and that we
will go heart and hand with our brethren of
the West in securing it.
Resolved, That we look upon the construc?
tion of the Atlantic and Great Western Canal
and the inlaud water communication along the
Gulf toward the East as a matter of deep in?
terest to the prosperity of Georgia and the
South, and we, therefore, earnestly request
our representatives in Congress and in the
State Legislature to urge by every proper
means its importance upon the Federal Gov?
ernment.
Resolved, That the resources of our farmers
are large and the recuperative energy of the
country great, and that a return to the cash
system as soon as practicable would insure the
prosperity of the country on a solid basis.
Resolved, That we recommend the State
Grange at its next meeting shail appoint a
State chemist, in order to protect the Patrons
of Husbandry against imposition and worthless
fertilizers.
The majority report on refunding the cotton
tax was adopted as follows:
a That we respectfully request our representa?
tives and senators in Congress to urge the en?
actment of a law restoring to the legitimate
claimant the unconstitutional tax imposed
upon the cotton crops of 1862 to 1867, inclu?
sive.
Mr. T. J. Smith, of Washington County, of?
fered the following, which was adopted :
Resolved, That the resolution, as passed by
the meeting of yesterday, relati/e to propor?
tioning the crop in planting next year, that is,
one-third in small grain, one-third in corn, and
one-third in cotton, be taken by each member
of this convention to his constituents, or a del?
egate of Granges of Patrons of Husbandry to
each of their Granges, State and subordinate,
and impress upon them the great importance
of this resolution, and urge that it be carried
out to the letter.
The following resolutions were adopted :
Resolved, That this convention urge upon the
farmers and patrons of the South to devise, at
the earliest possible period, the best means to
have the Southern people co-operate in the
centennial movement by being ready to supply
and exhibit such agricultural and horticultural
products as may be cultivated upon our farms,
gardens and orchards.
Resolved, That it is the sense of the conven?
tion that Congress should so modify the tariff
laws that imposts be gathered from nothing but
such articles as are by common conaent denom?
inated luxuries.
Resolved, That the presiding officer appoint a
committee of one from each State represented
in this convention, whose duty it shall be to
report to this convention the expediency of
making arrangements whereby the planters
may make shipment direct to Europe of their
cotton.
Resolved, That it is the sense of this meeting
that as soon as proper arrangements can be
made the planters are advised to send a por?
tion of their cotton to European markets.
Resolved, That in view of making our farms
self-sustaining by sowing down one-third of the
available lands in small grain and grasses, and
plant one-third in corn and one-third in cot?
ton, we hereby recommend the masters of the
respective Cotton States Granges to submit this
policy to the subordinate granges for their
adoption, and that the masters of subordinate
granges be requested to urge the voluntary
pledges thereto, and report the result to the
masters of the State granges, who will then re?
port to the president of this convention the
number of subordiuatc granges in each State
that have pledged themselves to this policy,
and such information will be diffused through
the public press by the president.
The convention then adjourned to meet un?
der the call of the president, on sixty days'
notice through the newspapers of the Cotton
State?, at such time and place as he may desig?
nate.
Synopsis of President Grant's Message. I
The President's message was read. It opens
with a reference to the financial crisis, the
Grangers' movement aud the Virginius matter,
which, it says, are in course of negotiation, and
likely to be amicably and honorably arranged.
It refers to the Vienna Exposition, which was
creditable to the artisans of the United States;
to the reception of the Western ambassadors
by the Emperor of China, and to the need of
further legislation to suppress the infamous
coolie trade.
The President recommends a commission for
the purpose of auditing aud determining the
amount to be paid for losses caused by the Con?
federate privateers; refers to the mixed com?
mission for determining claims between British
subjects aud American citi2ens, and asks for an
appropriation to pay the amount of decisions
against the United States. It also recommends
a law creating a special court of three judges
to hear and determine all claims of aliens
against the United States arising out of acts
committed against their persons and property
during the insurrection. It asks the decision
of Congress on the subject of the action of the
Ottoman and Egvptian governments relieving
foreign consuls of judicial powers. The Presi?
dent transmits the application of the republic
of Santo Domingo, that the United States shall
exercise a protectorate over that republic. The
message discusses at some length the question
of the right of expatriation, particularly as to
citizens of the United States residing perma?
nently ftbroad with their families, rnd suggests
legislation on the subject. It refers to the es
tabl'shment of a republic in Spain, and to the
efforts of the new government to abolish slave?
ry in all its dominion, which efforts are oppo?
sed by the reactionary slaveholders of Cuba,
who are vainly striving to stop the march of
civilization. This baleful influence has thus
aided in defeating the efforts of all liberal
minded men in Spain to abolish slavery in
Cuba, and in preventing the proposed reform
in that island in the interest of humanity, of
civilization, and of progress. It was to be
hoped that that evil influence might be soon
averted .
In reference to the capture of the Virginius,
and to the inhuman and illegal murder of fifty
three of her passengers and crew, he says that
the Spanish Government had recognized the
justice of his demand, and had arranged for
the immediate delivery of the vessel, and for
the surrender of the survivors of the passeu
gers aud crew, and for a salute to the flag, and
for proceedings looking to the punishment of
those who may be proved to have been guilty
of illegal acts of violence towards citizens of
the United States, and, also, towards indemni?
fying those who may be shown to be entitled to
indemnity. The correspondence on the subject
had been conducted in cipher and by cable,
and was therefore not in a condition to be sub?
mitted to Congress. The President expresses
his conviction that the expense of African
slavery in Cuba is a principal cause of the la?
mentable condition of the island, and docs not
j doubt that Congress shares his hopes that it
j will soon be made to disappear, aud that peaco
and prosperity will follow its abolition.
He suggests two constitutional amendments,
one to authorize the President to approve so
much of any measure of Congress as his judg
;' ment may dictate, without approving the
I whole, aud the other to provide that when an
j extra session of Congress is convened by exec?
utive proclamation, legislation shall be con
j fined to such subjects as the Executive may
j bring before Congress from time to time in
' writing.
He recommends the erection at Washington
of suitable buildings for cabinet officers, and
for such officials as now receive commutation
for quarters; thus setting an example to the
States which may induce them to erect build?
ings for their Senators.
The message goes very fully into the finan?
cial question, and declares that the country
never can have permanent prosperity until
specie payments shall be reached. He recom?
mends legislation prohibiting national banks
from paying interest on deposits and forcing
them into resumption, if only in legal tender
notes. He suggests the question whether bank?
ing should not be made free, but securing all j
the present safeguards to biil holders.
He notices the improvement in American
?hip building during tne past yoar, and hopes
j for a continuance of it.
: In regard to the problem of cheap transpor
| tation he refers to the Erie and Illinois eanajs,
j and suggests whether it would not be wise
statesmanship to pledge to the States that own
those canals that if they will enlarge them the
general government will look after and keep
lq navigable condition the great public high?
ways with which those canals connect, to wit:
The Hudson River, the St. Clair Flats, and the
Illinois and Mississippi Rivers.
He recommends a government exploration
of the upper Amazon River, and its tributa?
ries; a revision and codification of the tariff
laws, and the opening of more merits ; endor?
ses the recommendation of the postmaster
general for the establishment of post office
savings depositories, and invites the considera?
tion of Congress to the proposition for a postal
telegraph.
He recommends legislation in iegard to the
judicial proceedings in Utah, and, also, in re?
gard to the bankruptcy law, which he considers
as productive of more evil than good. If not
totally repealed, it should be modified in those
portions providing for involuntary bankrupt?
cy?those portions should be repealed.
He calls attention to the immense aggregate
of claims against the government, many of
them growing out of the rebellion, and not a
few of them fabricated and supported by false
testimony. He recommends that persons hav?
ing claims be required to present them at an
early period, ar:^ that the personal attendance
of witnesses be required by the Court of Claims.
In regard to the Indian question, he recom?
mends a territorial form of government for the
Indian Territory. He also recommends such
action as will permit the settlement of a body
of Russian colonists on the public lands, and
endorses the proposition for a census in 1876.
He eulogizes the Washington board of pub?
lic works, and speaks of the great improve?
ment of the city under the operations of the
board. He recommends a liberal policy on the
part of Congress in defraying a part of the
expenses, and suggests the establisnment here
of a national university.
He recommends the passage of an enabling
act for the admission of Colorado as a State,
and suggests the opening of a canal, for the
purpose of irrigation, from the eastern slope of
the Rocky mountains to the Missouri river.
In conclusion, he renews his recommenda?
tion for general amnesty, and says: There are
a number of citizens yet laboring under disa?
bilities, very small, but enough to keep up a
constant irritation. There can be no possible
danger to the government in restoring them to
eligibility to hold office; and suggests the
enactment of a law better to secure the civil
rights which freedom should secure, but has
not effectually secured to the enfranchisement
of the slave.
Thoughts for the Mouth.
"The harvest is gathered, and autumn stands
Serenely thoughtful with folded hands."
Little remains to be done upon the farm, but
to wind up the business of the year. The
early maturity of the crops and the favorable
autumn for all harvesting operations, have left
less unfinished work than usual. Hands must
now be paid off and ample arrangements made
for Christmas week, when no labor can be ex?
pected from the frolicsome sons and daughters
of Ham. Pay the last cent due them, and
place no obstacles in the way of their enjoy?
ment. Any effort to restrain, will end in utter
failure, without any good. We advocate a
general relaxation of business and care, for
both whites and blacks, at the close of the year.
Family re-unions?social enjoyments, gifts and
acts of kindness to the poor and suffering?let
one week at least of the fifty-two be given up
to these, that the fires of love and gratitude
may be kindled anew. Whilst businessis right
aud proper, and we ought to be "diligent"
therein, let us remember that it ? not all of
life to make money. It may take wings and
fly away, but the gentle charities of life will
not only brighten the world around us now,
but follow us when we depart. Is it too much
to consecrate one week in the year to the home
and the heart f
Although gloom and despondency have vest?
ed upon the South of late, we confidently look
for a brighter future. The disasters of the
hour cannot fail to produce a rich harvest.
We shall be more than compensated, if they
put an end to the extravagance of living?to
the ruinous credit system in vogue?to tho

and thus get back some of that independence,

Let us like wise men forsake the follies of
the recent past, and with renewed hope, renew?
ed courage and "purged vision/1 prepare for
the labors of another year.?Southern Cultiva?
tor.
; Fallen Men.?A writer in the Chieago
Tribune has stirred up tho public mind by dis?
cussing the rather odd problem of "fallen
men." Society is taken to task for admitting
to its ranks the unfortunate of the male ?ex,
while a harrier stronger than adamant is op?
posed to the introduction into that sacred area
of unhappy women, who have sinned. This
Chicago writer says if there is any blame at all
in the matter it is with the ladies themselves,
for they constitute and rule what is known as
"society." Gail Hamilton says:
"If women were as careful to select pure,
honorable men for husbands, as men are to
choose virtuous women for wives, there would
be less complaint than now."
To which the commentator adds this terrible,
and, in many respects, truthful verdict:
"Let women refuse admission to their society
of men of disreputable character, with tho
same degree of feminine aversion that they
manifest towards a fallen woman, and, presto I
society is purified at once. Let them disre?
gard all claims of wealth or family position
that such men bring, and simply say, as society
docs in the case of the woman, that one blot
upon a man debars him forever from admission
to the society of tho good and pure, and it will
not be long before all complainers will have
no occasion to accuse society of dealing unjust
with sinners. I presume that, m the event of
such an experiment, young ladies might banish
from their presence favored courtiers, and per?
haps be obliged to attend theatres with mamma
for an escort; but let us have either a cessation
of this incessant croaking or an application of j
the right remedy, and less talk about 'a home |
for fallen men.'" J
Fearful Collision at Sea and Loss of Life.
London, Dec 1, 1873.
The steamship Ville du Havre and ship Loch
Earn came in collision on the morniDg of the
23rd of November. The first named vessel was
lost and the second badly damaged.
Two hundred and twenty-six of the persons
on the steamship lost their lives.
Eighty-seven souls were saved from the
steamship, including 33 first-class passengers,
10 of whom are ladies, 29 firemen and boys,
and 25 of the crew, including the Captain and
five of his officers.
The purser of the ill-fated steamship gives
the following narrative: "We were seven days
out on Saturday night. I was sleeping in my
berth when the collision occurred. Hushing
on deck I descried a sailing ship, and three
minutes later gained the fearful conviction
that the steamship was going down by the bow.
Thirty or forty passengers managed to get into
the longboat, and life grew strong within them
when they were freed from the sinking vessel ;
but, suddenly, the mizenmast fell nnd left the
side of the vessel, killing or wounding nearly
all of them. Immediately afterwards the main?
mast fell on the deck, killing and wounding
more. The water was rushing down the wind?
pipe with fearful velocity. The vessel was
sinking. I jumped overboard, with another,
and commenced swimming towards the Loch
Earn, which was half a mile off. Looking
around I saw the steamer disappear, without
reeling, going down head foremost. For a mo?
ment a mighty shriek rent the air?the last
outbreak of agony. A deathlike calm suc?
ceeded the noise and tumult. The Captain re?
mained on the bridge during the whole scene.
He was rescued one hour later. Six officers
out of fifteen were saved, all by swimming for
life, with the exception of the First Lieuten?
ant, who went in a boat to the Loch Earn."
The Purser here added s. touching narrative
of the conduct of a French priest, his calmness
on deck, where he remained dispensing his
blessings to the people, and continued :
"The boats cruised until ten o'clock next
morning, engaged in the hopeless task of pick?
ing up others of the survivors. I remained on
board the British ship until three o'clock and
was then transferred to the American ship Tri
mountain, Captain Urqnhart."
Captain Urquhart gives the following narra?
tive : "Ou Saturday morning I saw a vessel
on the weather bow, with bowsprit gone and
sails flowing, which proved to be the Loch
Earn, of Glasgow, bound for New York. The
Captain asked to transfer the passengers and
crew of the steamer Ville du Havre, which
was sunk at two o'clock that morning. All
except two, a French priest and another per?
son, remained to nurse the wounded. It was a
.pitiful sight to behold human beings huddled
together in a small cabin, heart broken and
destitute of clothing, but still thankful for
the hospitality which they received on the
Loch Earn.
"Many of them were hurt by fragments of
the wreck.
"I cruised around till nearly dark, and then
proceeded on my voyage for Bristol. Not a
vestige of the ship, or of man, woman or child,
was discovered.
"There was rather a heavy sea, but little
wind, when the disaster occurred.
"The shock was fearful. The rapidity of the
steamer going down prevented launching more
than a whalcboat and the captain's gig. In 12
minutes after being struck the ship went down.
The terror which prevailed among the passen?
gers paralyzed the efforts to save many. Many
never quitted their state rooms, whole families
meeting death together."
London, Dec. 1,1873.
The following additional particulars of the
loss of the Ville du Havre have been gathered
from officers and passengers at Cardiff.
The Ville du Havre experienced a thick fog
until the 20th. At the time of the collision
the weather was clear. Little wind was blow?
ing, but there was a heavy sea. The Captain
had just retired and the Second Officer was in
charge. The lights on the steamer were all
right. The collisiou was wholly unexpected, j
The Loch Earn struck the steamer amidships,
and made a chasm 12 feet deep and from 25 to
30 feet wide. The exact position of the Ville
du Havre at the time was latitude 47 deg. 21
.min., longitude 35 deg. 31 min. Panic took
possession of the passengers. Five minutes
after the collision the main and mizen masts
fell across two large boat3, which were filled
with people and ready for launching. The
boats were crushed to pieces and many of their
occupants killed and injured.
In the brief interval between the collision
and the sinking of the steamer the crew were
able to launch only a whale boat and the Cap?
tain's gig. The Loch Earn, went a mile before
stopping. She then got out four boats to pick
up the people struggling in the water. Mean?
while the whale boat, under the command of
the Second Lieutenant of the Ville du Havre,
picked up one load of those who were clinging
to planks, spars, &c., and took them to the
Loch Earn. She returned to the scene and
rescued another load. Captain Surmont, who
remained on deck to the last, was rescued by
this boat three-quarters of an hour after the
collision. One of his oflicers swum a mile to
the Loch Earn, and was hauled on board with
a rope. The boats continued to search the
waters in the vicinity of the disaster until
there was no hope of saving more lives. The
cold was intense. Many of the survivors were
immersed two hours, and were almost lifeless
when rescued.
The ship Trimountain sighted the Loch Earn
at eight o'clock a. m., six hou.H after the sink?
ing of the steamer, and received the survivors
as before reported.
The savea speak in the highest terms of the
kindness of dpt. Urquhart, her commander.
There were six stowaways on board the Ville
du Havre.
. Increase of the Public Debt.?The "off
year" in politics seems to be a bad year for the
liquidation of our public indebtedness. Al?
though the month of September showed a re?
duction of about two millipus iu the national
debt, the month of October exhibited an in?
crease of over three millions, and now the
official statement for the past month of No?
vember presents an increse of over nine mil?
lions, making the total debt, le?s cash in the
treasury, December 1, $2,150,S(>2,053. It would
therefore appear that the less we have of "off
ears" in our political affairs the better it will
e for our national pecuniary obligations. It
is gratifying to learn, however, that we have
nearly a hundred and fourteen millions in coin
and coin certificates in the Treasury, which
will bo a good thing to fall back upon in case
of emergency.?X. Y. Herald.
Fine Chopping.?Mr. B. C. Crawford, of
our County, has made twenty-eight bales of
cotton, with one mule and three hands, upon
twenty-eight acres?one bale to the acre, j
nine bales to the hand, and twenty-eight bales
to the mule I Who can beat this? Mr. C. is
a son of Mr. J. W. Crawford, of Pendleton,
one of the most skillful and successful planters
of the up-country, and is a worthy chip of the
old block.? Abbeville Press and Banner.
The Hoosac Tunnel.
It is now nearly half a century since the
Hoosac Tunnel became familiar to the reader
of newspapers. As far back as 1825 it was
gravely proposed to tunnel'the Hoosac Moun?
tain, in order that a canal might be made to
connect Boston with the Hudson River: at the
junction of the Erie Canal with that river.
Time passed on ; proposal after proposal was
made; contract after contract was entered into';
but up almost until the present it has seemed
as if the Hoosac Tunnel project had been kept
alive merely for the benefit of politicians and
contractors. It is only within the last few
months that the work was so.far advanced that
the public had any assurance that the tunnel
would ever be completed. The present con?
tractors went into the work heartily, and such
has been their success that it is confidently.ex?
pected that before the Fourth of July next the
tunnel will be open for the purposes for which
it was intended. When completed this great
engineering enterprise will take rank with the
greatest works of the kind which will give this
age distinction in the years to come?with the
Suez Canal, the Pacific Railroad and the Mont
Cenis Tuunel; and the State of Massachusetts
is to be congratulated on the prospective com?
pletion of a work which, while it will be a gain
to itself, will be an advantage to the entire
Union. The labor has been long, the expense
has been great, but the completed work will be
a full and satisfactory reward.
An idea of the magnitude of the work may
be gathered from the following figures: In
length the tunnel will be 25,031 feet. There
will be two shafts, one of 1,028, and the other
of 318 feet in depth. The rosdway will be 24
feet wide, the height from grade to roof 26 feet,
the whole costing the Commonwealth of Mas?
sachusetts upwards of twelve millions of dol?
lars. It will be the second largest tunnel in
the world. The Mont Cenis Tunnel is seven
miles in length; the Hoosac will be four and
three-quarter miles. What effect this new road
will have on the trades, industry and commerce
of the East and West has yet to be tested.
After the Pacific Railroad it is the greatest
piece of engineering which the United States
have undertaken and all but accomplished, and
its successful completion will encourage the
hope that the isthmus of Panama will not
much longer be allowed to obstruct the rapidly
growing trade of the New World. According
to ancient prophecy the rough places are to be
made plain and the crooked places straight.
We are seeing Seripture fulfilled every*day.
Mountains are no longer barriers, and seas, no
longer divide. The Hoosac Tunnel is another
triumph of our modern civilization.?New
York Herald.
President Grant and the Ex-Confede?
rates.?The Washington correspondent of the
New York Herald relates the following:
Colonel John S. Mosby to-day called on the
Presideut, for the first time since the Virginia
gubernatorial canvass. He was received most
cordially by the President aud several members
of the Cabinet. He offered his services in
case of a war with Spain, and the President
promised him a command, and said there was
no immediate danger of war; but in case there
should be, he had perfect confidence in the late
Confederate soldiers, aud intended to give the
commissions equally to the soldiers of the Fed?
eral and Confederate armies He spoke of
Hon. Alexander H. Stephens most kindly, and
was glad that ho had been returned to Con?
gress.
The President said that in his forthcoming
Message he intended to recommend universal
amnesty.
Colonel Mosby told the President that the
Virginia election was not a condemnation of
his (Grant's) administration, aud that he was
stronger than ever in that State. The Presi?
dent agreed with him, and" was not at all dis?
satisfied with the result. He expressed him?
self gratified at the tone of General Keinper's
speeches, and favored Mosby's policy of recon?
ciliation between the administration and the
white people of tr 2 South. The President
said that as long as he was in office the holders
of appointments made through Mosby's influ?
ence, should not be turned out, no matter who
tried to oust them; that hereafter he intended
to appoint to office from the South the best
men for the positions, and that he was very
much gratified at the good feeling manifested
by the Virginia conservatives towards his ad?
ministration, and was ready to respond to it.
Immigration Prospects.?Rev. Tilman R.
Gaincs expects to start for New York city on
Thursday, where he will give his particular at?
tention to filling all orders for immigrants that
may be made by the people of the State. Mr.
Gaincs has been hard at work in this matter,
among other things making a tour of some of
the upper counties, where he explained, and
made speeches in the interest of this project.
It would seem that his efforts are meeting with
some of the reward they are so deserving of, as
a number of orders have been received, and
contracts are underway for many more. Of the
first lot he will see to the forwarding of, twen?
ty-eight arc to go up the Greenville road, and
about as many more along the line of the Char?
lotte, Columbia and Augusta road. He expects
to send one hundred to Anderson county. We
are authorized to state, that he will give his
personal attention to the selection of cooks and
house servants. Duriug Mr. Gaines' absence,
his business here will be left in the charge of
a well known, competent gentlemen, notice of
which will be given iu due time.? Union-Her?
ald.
? A Young gentleman telegraph operator
iu Hartford, after repeated calls for a young
lady operator in another office, at last got a
response, and then he telegraphed back to her:
"I have been trying to get you for the last half
hour I" In a moment the following spicy reply
came tripping back to him over the wires from
the telegraphic maiden: "That's nothing.
There is a young man here been trying to do
the same thing for the last two years, and ho
hasn't got mc yet."
? A good old elder of a church who was
given to extravagant exaggeration, was at last
called to account for his offenses r.n that r^pect,
and admonished not to give way to the beset?
ting sin in the future. The good old man re?
ceived the admonition meetly, and earnestly
said : "I know how prone I am to this fault,
my brethren, and it has given me tortures of
pain ; and night after night I have shed barrels
of tears over it." The meeting adjourned in
silence.
? Some Western papers have broached the
subject of calling a convention of delegates
from all of the States, to be composed of the
ablest lawvers, to recommend to the State Leg?
islatures a uniform system of laws and forma
concerning the acquisition, enjoyment and dis?
position of real and personal, property, the
torms and requirements of wills, deeds, mort?
gages, notes, receipts ; the rules of taking and
certifying depositions and other similar mat
