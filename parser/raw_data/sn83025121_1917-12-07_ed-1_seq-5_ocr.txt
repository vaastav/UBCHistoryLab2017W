(benrrai rowers- wisr President WUson To the American People
Declares His Message
IVid Demonstration In Congress
In Favor Of VJar-Resolutions
IV Be Voted On In House
And Senate By End Of Week
W ASHINGTON, December 5 (Associated Press) War upon
Austro-Hungary, the vassal of Germany, and upon Bulgaria
and Turkey, the tools of German intrigue, was demanded by Presi
dent Wilson yesterday in his message to congress.' ' a
This demand" and the reasons prompting it were received by
wild demonstrations, senators and representatives cheering madly,
with the spectators who packed every gallery of the house of rep
resentatives joining in the cheers. The national anthem was sung
and there were scenes of enthusiasm such as have never before been
witnessed under the dome of the Capitol. ;,
Long after the President had left the chamber the demonstra
tion continued, while prior to the formal convening of4he congress
men in joint session there were cheers for Jhe various members at
they entered and took their seats. ' There were two notable excep
tions. When the blind senator from Oklahoma, Senator Gore, was
led by a page into the chamber, not a cheer nor a handclap greeted
him. He took his seat amid silence, being notably affected by the
marked-change in the greeting gven him to that with which his
colleagues had been received. . There was a stir when Senator La
Follette entered, but again the cheering died away to silence. ' The
Wisconsinite walked jauntily to his seat ; Y-':. ' '.'' '''
;.. : ; WAR RESOLUTIONS ON FRIDAY '
The reception given' to the President's request that a state of
.war be declared to exist between the United. . States 'and,' the' allies
of 'Germany tAIkes'lt certain thaf the "vofce vill be more nearly
. unanimous than that recorded in the resolution declaring war upon
Germany. The war resolutions will be before the house and senate
this week and will be voted upon, in all probability, before Saturday.
.' The resolution will be presented in the senate on Friday by
Senator Martin Of Virginia, and in the house, by Representative
Flood, also of Virginia. . '
" CENTRAL POWERS ONE FOE
In his message, in which the President rose to great heights, it
was "declared that the time had arrived when the Central Powers
must be regarded as one, equally hostile to civilization aid humanity
. and equally opposed to those ideals of. honor and justice upon which
the United States is founded. . ' '
The government of Austro-Hungary, declared the President, is
not acting according to the initiative or the expressed desires of the
people of the Dual Monarchy, but acting only as the vassal of Ger-
. many, the Power that had aimed its blows straight at the heart of
all that America holds highest and most sacred.
mmmZ".:-:.: .TOOLS OF BERLIN SCHEMERS
Wan against Austria is" necessary, said Mr. Wilson, in order to
clear away1 the impediments in the way of a successful war against
Germany. The same logic makes it necessary that there shall be
declarations of "War upon Bulgaria and Turkey, for while these na
tions do not stand directly in the onward path of the United States,
yet 'as tool of .Germany they must be included among the open
enemies of the American Union.
America's object now is to win the war and thcwhole energy
of congress at this session must be bent towards perfecting ami
forwarding those plans essential to victory, the President declared,
and the various acts he recommended and requested all deal, direct
ly or indirectly, with the one object. sv
ALL FOR ONE PURPOSE
Legislation to make more certain the punishment of spies and
traitors is asked for; legislation to more effectively handle those
who are impudently attempting to vring abnormal profits from the
people under the conditions brought about by the war is declared
to be essential; laws under which-the management of the railroad
systems of the country may be better coordinated will be asked for
later in the session if experience demonstrates their, necessity; laws
whereby the borders may be closed to travel when necessary are
required, while the statutes call for such revision as will enable more
just punishment to be inflicted upon alien enemies caught carrying
on acts of warfare. " ';
FIGHTING A HOLY WAR
The United States is fighting in a just and holy cause, said tte
Chief Magistrate, and must so guard herself that nothing may arise
to sully her conduct or result in a peace less just and less holy than
the motives prompting the taking up of arms.
Had the United States not espoused the cause of the Entente
and if, as a result of the staying out of the war the German cause
. had triumphed, the honor of the United States would have been
forever tarnished and her safety as a free nation would have been
seriously menaced. (
Germany is fighting with methods that outrage every principle
of humanity and violate every principle of knightly honor, with sin
ister designs upon- the freedom of every nation that refuses to how
Austria, as a vassal of Germany, and Bulgaria arid Turkev as trrl
of the Kaiserbund, are enemies of trie United States and must be declar
': ed-such. ' 'V- ' ' ' ;; y- -: "".' -

Repeatedly the President was interrupted by the
cheering applause of the congressmen and of the
visitors in the galleries, while,, again, his eloquence
resulted in a silence equally as emphatic in its ap
preciation as the great volume of cheers.
TEXT OF GREAT MESSAGE
The President's Message was:
"Gentlemen of Congress: It has been eight
months since I last addressed you and grave events
have intervened since' that time. I shall not at
tempt to summarize them. Thedepartments will
report to you the details of what has been done
and what is being done. - .
"Today I shall discuss only the outlook upon
the vast affairs on which we are engaged, our
present duty and the means of accomplishment.
I shall not discuss the causes of the war? The
intolerable wrongs piannea oy me smisier masters
of Germany have long been grossly obvious. Let
us consider again gravely our objectives and meas
ures of attainment. . . ,
"Our object is to win the war. We shall not
slacken energy and we shall not be, diverted until
this is done. '.
"Americans know the causes of war and know
what the realization proposes. They are of a uni-'
ted spirit in the intention not to heed the advices
cf dissent. I know that the criticisin of the noisily
thoughtless and the troublesome will fling itself
in impotent disloyalty against the calm and in
domitable, power of the nation.
PACIFISTS STAND ' FOR NOTHING
"We hear men debate peace who neither under
stand its nature nor how to attain it debate with
unbroken spirits and uplifted eyes. .None of them
speak for the natjon. rThey do not touch the heart
of anything.
"Another viewpoint believes Tt necessary to ask
that we shall say plainly what-we consider we
have gone into the war for and what is the essen
tial element of its issues.
"We are acting as spokesmen for a people, and
ihey are entitled to know whether their purposes
are ours.
"They desire peace by overcoming evil, and by
the decisive defeat of sinister forces. They are
deeply and indignantly impatient of compromise.

GERMANY MUST PROVE TRUE
"Secondly, when this is accomplished and when
the German people have spokesmen whose word
we can believc and who accept the judgement of
Stations as to the law and covenants for world-life,
wp sjiall be willing and glad to pay the full price
of peace ungrudgingly.
v"This price will be full and impartial justice for

vindictively. The first sstep is to show autocracy
the futility of its claims in the modern world, Until-
this is done, we cannot establish right as the

will.it will assuredly be, we are free to base speech

"Let there be no misunderstanding as to the
immediate task of war, le's nothing be allowed to
divert our energies uptil it is won. To those de-
siring'peace before the end is attained, I counsel
fhem (to4"carry their advice elsewhere. We shall
4ioU entertain it
"We1 shall regard the war as won only when
Germany . shall say through her accredited repre-.
sentatives that they agree to settlement on a basis
of justice and of reparation for the wrongs their
rulers have done.
"The wrong to Belgium must be repaired. The
powers over. Austro-IIungary and the Balkan
states, and Turkey in Asia, must be relinquished.
"We have not grudged the German successes by
ikill, industry, knowledge and enterprise rather
have we admired them. But these they threw away
to establish military dominion. . V,

wrong. -: We do not wish to rearrange or impair
