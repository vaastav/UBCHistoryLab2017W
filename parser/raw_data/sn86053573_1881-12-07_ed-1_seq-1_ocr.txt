THE MESSAGE IN NEW YORK
v
Wlint ho ItrniUnti Jnprra or tile Urnst
Cliy Nay oril
Nkw YoitK Dec 0 Tomorrows Herald
will say Tho messago of President Arthur Is
admirably written calm and dlgnltlcd In style and
tone and advises Congress as It Is his his constitu
tional duty to do on many important subjects
with a wisdom and sound Judgment which
will win for hlin tho publta conQdenco and for
his recommendations tho attentive consideration
of both Houses Tho mcatago Is nil nblu and con
scrratlvo document Most of Its recommenda
tions seem lobocntlrely wlso and Judicious and
whero we should differ from him as In tho treat
ment of tho question of shipping tho President
has but spoken tho sentiments of his party which
favors subsidies and grants
The limit will say Tho first message of Presi
dent Arthur la n very careful and woll maturcd
document Its tono Is mora frank and direct than
Is customary In such papers and Its recommenda
tions extenslvo and varied as they arc show that
tho President has patiently rcvlowcd tho
Held of labor so recently and so unexpectedly
opened beforo him uud tharbo isnot Inclined to
shirk the constitutional duty of aiding Congress
by Ids suggestions and udvlcc As the Preside nt
holds to all Intent and purposes an Important
imrt lu tho legislative power of the Government
this ultimo Is entirely proper On most joints
which Mr Arthur touches ho expresses himself
with clearness and good Judgment
The Horfci snss Eecrjbudy will admit the
Presidents mes sgc to bo a buslncss llko paper
Hint however Is tho falut praise which people
are accustomed to bestow upon messages which
aro entirely pointless and as President
Arthurs messago Is by no means point
less the stock phraso falls to do Justice to It
In fact Its extinction la that It Is pointed It may
almost be said to brlstlo with points when con
trasted with the smooth and arid Imbecility of
Mr 11a ca messages There Is Indeed an aggres
sive Individuality about scleral portions of
the messago as far as possible removed
from the oracular and Impersonal tono
which has bccojno ns customary In Presidents
messages as In speeches from tho throne Tho
message In a w ord Is full of lew s and tho views
aro not pretended to bo Iho views of the country
or even of a party but only the personal opinions
of thoniithororthcmiossiige which aro to bo taken
ns the Brylng Is for what they aro worth In re
gard to the llnanccs and to our foreign relations
tho President speaks with a furco and clearness
which will command tho respect of patriotic men
of all parties
Tho jrwfrurKsays Tho best Informed citizens
will derive from this review much Interesting and
Important Information in regard to foreign ntlalrs
and In this panic ularthomcssago Is unusually lull
ami valuable tho vigorous work of Mr Iilnlno
being every whero felt In tho record Tho messago
Is strongest on foreign relations and finance but
it Is not weak an where and It will be generally
accepted by the country at a Judicious moderate
and In most respects satisfactory document

It Is curious how history repents Itself
It might bo supposed from tho circumstances of
tho case that tho ttar routo Investigation which
has been attracting so much attention during tha
latt few months was without a precedent In our
history yet It Is almost nn exact repetition of
ev cnts which happened nearly fifty years ngo As
publlo attention has not heretofore been
called to tho matter anywhere n statement oftho
facts will bo new and Interesting Through tho
kindness or a rrletul tho Time Is lu possession of

Tho address was a reply to a majority report of Iho
Scnato Committee on Post OITlccs and Post Roads
which was presented In tho Senate n short tlmo
previous to tho publication of tho address The
report was ono of ccnturo of tho Postmaster-General
for his administration of tho Department Iho
main chargo being that ha had Improperly and
Illegally expedited tho service on certain routes
