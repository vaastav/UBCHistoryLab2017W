SCIENTIFIC CONSCIENCE.
As IaereatlBr Tele of Two Geolo.
rlata and an Exceedinfflr
Beantlfnl Fossil.
Happening to know two men who were
deeply interested in geology and vrho did not
know each other a Detroit man brought the
two scientists together recently at the house
of one of them and then left them to enjoy
the occasion. A day or two later he met the
host in the case and heard th- strange story
from him:
"Well, Mr. Cooper, that was a fine man you
brought out to see me the other night a fine
man. Why, he's as crazy about geology as I
am. if not a trifle crazier. We sat up to
gether until after midnight, looking over rny
specimens and talking about them, and I'm
going down to see his cases. lie tells me he
has almost bankrupted himself " indulging
his taste for rare and beautiful fossils. A
funny thing happened the other night, too;
he's a great one that man! On my library
table I had one remarkably beautiful fossil
too choice to be hidden away in a case and
yet too valuable to be left b ins around. I
needn't tell you what it was. for you don't
know one from another. Your friend does,
however, and he returned again and again
to admire this particular specimen. Of
course, I enioyed his enthusiastic apprecia
tion of it, ana when he was abouto go I said:
'Mr. Badger, you admired this fossil so much
I'm going to give myself the pleasure of part
ing with it to you Please add it to your col
lection.' So saying. I extended my hand for
the fossil, and behold, it wasn't there.
On the table and under the table I looked,
behind the lamp, and under papers no fos-
sil a mysterious disappearance. I felt non
plussed and looked at my guest. He looked
sheepish, fumbled in the inside of hissacoue
coat and said: 'Well, I'm glad you are going
to give me that fossil. I already had it in
my pocket.' -
"As I had often done the same trick my
self I eouldn't utter a word of protest. .
" Well, well I said, 'take it along and
heartily welcome.

A M0N0MANIACAL WITNESS.
His Peculiar Phase of Lunacy Un
Developed Daring a Trial
In Court.
"That calls to mind a queer experience of
my own," said a lawyer who had listened to
the story. c "Some years ago I defended
fellow for murder in a little southern town,
and the worst witness we had against us wai
an old German who was a stackbuilder by
trade. A stack, by the way, is merely anothei
name for a big chimney. The old fellow wa
perfectly honest, and gave his evidence in
such a. clear, straightforward manner that I
felt my client was doomed unless I could
think of some way to break him down. While
I was cudgeling my brains a friend whispered
to me to ask him how high be could build a
stack. 'What do you mean?' I asked, in sur
prise. Jever mind," said my friend.' 'jiyrt '
slip in that question and see. So at the tail
end of the cross-examination I paused, a
if struck by an afterthought, and said: Yoo
are a stackbuilder, I believe? 'Yes, sir,' re
plied the witness. "Well, sir,' I continued,
about how high could you build I nevet
got any further. A swift, inscrutable change
flashed over the German's face, and he ross
excitedly from his chair. 'As high as der
sky! he roared. 'So high dfose angels corns
around it like birds! In five seconds he was
raving. You see, the man was a mono
maniac sane on every subject but one, and
my friend happened to know his weak spot.
It is hardly necessary to say that his evi
dence in regard to the homicide was prompt
ly ruled out by the judge, and as there was no
other witness of importance my man wai
cleared. The rascal should have been hanged,
and would have been bnt for the lucky ref
erence to the stack. N. O. Times-Democrat.
