A mystery iof the sea was brought
to Honolulu today by the steamer Clau

Maul ports. An old partially torn llfo
buoy held the mystery brought by Cap

tho buoy was aroused the utmost cu

It had been found on Lanal about two

TION KICKING OVER PROPOSI
TION TO ERECT MONUMENT.
Residents of Palama and Knllhl are
Kicking against the proposition of the
Japanese erecting a band stand at
.Aala Park. A well known resident of
that seotion said this afternoon "I do
not see by what right the Japanese are
allowed to erect on the public property
of tho county, any monument to their
dead. I do not think It Is right. If
tho supervisors want us to have a band
stand let them build one there but do
not let tho Japanese do It. It seems
to mo that these Islands aro Japanese
enough already without letting them
erect monuments In tho shape of I
stands In our public parks."

United States Attorney Dunne made
a vigorous objection to the use of such
a term in tho presence of tho jury, and
Judgo Dole said It was improper. At
torney Strauss wanted to know If he
must have the jury retire while a form
of question was argued.
"I will requlro you to refrain from
using such language to a witness here
after," said the court, " and to offer
an apology or withdraw the question."
Strauss offered an apology, which tho
court accepted. Then the attorney ex
cepted to tho remarks tho court had
made and the cross-examination proceeded.
OS A MYSTERY
OF THE GRUEL SEA
port of tho vessel had been painted on
one side of the buoy but most of tho
letters of the port were obliterated.
The following was the name of the
vessel " S. Celeste." This was on
tho upper rim of the buoy and on the
lower appeared "C amm e."
The latter name was evidently the home
port of th'e craft, An Inquiry In'the
shipping reglstors" failed to disclose any
such steamer except -one-' whoso homo
port was Cardiff, and whose register
was of about 6650 tons so that vessel

THE NAVY
DEPARTMENT
GETS BUSY
SIGNS THAT ROOSEVELT'S RECOMMENDATIONS HAVE ALREADY
HAD AN EFFECT FAVORABLE TO FORTIFICATIONS HERE
NAVY DEPARTMENT CABLES ORDERS TO GO AHEAD WITH
PEARL HARBOR LAND DEALS AGREEMENTS REACHED.
Deeds are about to be executed by
which the United States will acquire
two more pieces of property wanted for
Pearl Harbor fortifications. Whether
as a result of the President's message
or for some other reason there has
been a stirring up of the matter In
Washington and several cables have
been received during the past few day3
directing that the deals for acquiring
the lunds be closed. The owners of tho
property are the Bishop Estate and the
John II Estate, and lu both cases
agreements have . been reached
which obviate the necessity of press
ing condemnation suits. District At
torney Breekons Is arranging for exe
cution of deeds.
It Is believed that tho Increased ac
tivity of tho Navy Department in the
matter is due to. the recommendations
made by President Roosevelt. The
Navy Department, expecting that there
will be an appropriation for tho forts,
Is probably anxious to have -Its titles
ready so that operations may be begun
without delay.
CARTER HAS VERY SHORT TALK
WITH SPAULDINU OVER MULO
ICAN AFFAIR.
Governor Carter, Land Commlsaionof
Pratt and Manager Spauldlng ot Ma
ke, had a very short conference this
morning over the Molokan land pro
position. A sudden discovery that there
was no agreement with Spauldlng over
cane contraots with the Russians, wlrn
It was supposed that a complete agree
ment had been reached, was the oc
casion of the conference, which is said
to have been quite as lively as it was
short. Both the governor and Pratt
understood that an agreement had been
arrived at when the Russian represen
tatives were here, and the governor
is believed to have emphatically stated
his position this morning and his dis
approval of the obstacle which has

It Is doubtful If his official duties would

Tho objection to tho Immediate de-
Parture of a delgation is that there Is
In the Bishop Estate case a con
demnation suit had already been bo
gun. The land Is 12 acres along tho
shore of Pearl Harbor channel, on the
Honolulu side, well out towards the
entrance. An answer to the condemn
ation suit was filed yesterday by
Holmes nnd Stanley, In behalf of the
Bishop Estate. It placed the value of
the land at $2,800, a valuation which
the government will not contest, so
that there will be only the formal en
tering of a judgment In favor of tho
government.
The II Estate land is tho end of Poo
kala point. The price agreed upon is
not yet made public, but District At
torney Breekons this morning said
that an agreement had been reached,
and that deeds would soon be passed.
By condemnation suits or compromise
the federal government has now ac
quired a lot of land at Pearl Harbor,
for the Navy Department, and It is
not unlikely that actual work will bo
begun on a large scale beforo long.
REPORT THAT THE TERMS AND
INSTRUCTIONS OFFERED To
HIM ARE UNSATISFACTORY.
Tilt-re are local reports that Secre
tary Atkinson Is likely to cable back a
refusal to go to Europe under tho let
ter of Instructions sent him. Atkin
son's friends say he will not like the
polite request that he "keep a, .very
accurato account of his expenditures"
and that he will also probably object
to so many detailed Instructions as to
how to proceed. The Board of Immi
gration has addressed Atkinson as if
he was a mere clerk, it Is said, Inst' ad
of being Us president.
Atkinson Is to await the letter In the
East, and Is expected to cable bock
his acceptance or refusal of the job
when he has read the terms and Instructions.

CHARGE THAT DETENTION STA
TION LEPERS EASILY ESCAPE
OR RECEIVE VISITORS.
A scandalous state ot affairs Is re
ported to exist at tho Kallhl Leper De
tention station. It Is stated that tho
supposed lepers who are there escape
with ease at night time and spend
their nights elsewhere, returning In
the morning to tho confinement. Wo
ment In tho camp are said to recelvo
visitors from the outside, tho visitors
easily climbing over the fence after
dark.
"I went on several nights to watch
when I had been told by a resident
nearby that thero were such goings on"
said one who claims to have personally
Investigated the matter. "I saw It last
night. On several other nights I havo
watched tho lepers escape and have
also watched visitors go Into tho camp
Ono night I saw a leper in an advanced
stago leave with a friend and take a
ride on a street car. She was In a
condition of very apparent leprosy and
had lost several lingers."
Residents whose homes are close by
tho Detention Camp havo been making
a move, to complain about tho matter.
Ono man called at the federal mar
shal's otllce desiring to make a kick,
being of the opinion that It was a mat
ter for federal authorities to tako up.
Ho did not mako his complaint, being
Informed that the United States officers
had nothing to do with tho matter.
