CITTCOCXCIL.
The Board f Mayor and Aldermen
met last Tuesday evening.
Samuel Johnson, E?q was appointed
and entered upon the-duticsof the of
fice of Mayor pro trm, until Mayor
Sullivan has recovered from his severe
illness.
We learn that his Honor acquitted
himself most handsomely as a presid
ing officer, at the meeting on Tuesday.
To his tact as such, is attributable the
large amount of business transacted
on that occasion.
The street Committee reported, that
the pond on Fifih street had become
a nuisance, and besides endangering
the health ot the citizens in that
vicinity, was damaging private proper
ty in that locality. They recommended
that it be drained. Also, that the sewer
on Madison street, opposite Female
Academy, was obstructed and water to
the depth of several inches was stand
ing, which if not attended to promptly,
would result in injury to the property
of the Baptist Church and B. O.
Keesee. Some minor repairs were re
quired on the streets in the heart of
ihe city.
These suggestions and recommenda
tions were concurred la by the Board,
and the street committee and Mayor
were authorized and instructed to act
in tie matter. The street Committee
were also instructed to contract with
6ome suitable person to erect stone
coruer-posts to mark the corporation
line, as per recent survey, not to cost
over $1.25 each.
The proposition to have a compe
tent engineer to make a plat of the
city was tabled.
The Chairman of the Finance Com
mittee, submitted a full report (too
lengthy for insertion here) of the ex
penditures and liabilities of the city
for the currect year, and also of the
resources at hand to meet the same.
We will only add that the showing was
highly satisfactory, and allayed much
fear and anxiety that existed in regard
to maintaining the credit of the city.
Alderman Rick made known that of
late, there were frequent applications
made at the Station house, by worthy
persons for lodging, and there were no
suitable accommodations fur them,
and advocated that the Board make
some provision for such person. The
matter was referred to the Police com
mittee. The committee on the Commerce
street extension, reported that they
had examined the line of the proposed
extension, and all the property owners,
save one, had not only given the right
of way, but several had offered to con
tribute from their private purses to
defray the expense incurred. The
Bo ird, iu view of other pressing de
mands, defered action at present.
The Market-house and Work-house
committees were granted further time
to report.
After hearing it-ports of city officers,
the Board adjourned.
The Catholic Fair.
A Fair for the benefit of the Catholic
Church will be held in Franklin Hall,
Monday and Tuesday evenings, the
20th and 21st insts. It is the first of
the kiud given in Clarksville and
promises to be an interesting entertain
ment Among the many attractions
of the Fair will be two Fancy Tables ;
one in charge -f Mrs. Michel, assisted
by Mrs. Parlin and Miss Boillin. At
this table there will be voting for a
beautiful gold headed cane, now on
exhibition at Mr. Estes' store, to be
given to the candidate for Mayor who
receives the greater number of votes
each voter paying twenty-five cents for
the privilege. Votes will be cast only
for those who will have their names
before the public as candidates at the
ensuing election. Of course there is
no objection to the repeating of votes
on payment of the required fee. The
second Fancy Table will be in charge
of Mrs. Weil, assisted by 3Irs. Shay,
Mrs. Driscoll, Miss Burke and Miss
Manning. The supper, for those who
wish to partake, will be prepared un
der the management of Mrs. Weil, as
sisted by Mrs. Sullivan, Mrs. Sheeliy
and several young ladies. Visitors to
the Fair will receive "Good news from
home" through the post-office, in
charge of Miss Louisa Cowin and Miss
Lizzie Boillin, while "Rebecca at the
well," represented by Miss Branigan
will refresh the weary with cooling
drinks. Aduiis-ioq to the hall 25 cts.
Doors open at 7 P- m.
We commend highly the action of
the City Couucil ju the step it has
taken towards provididing "lodging and
resting" apartments for a very nu
merous, but unfortunate, class of per
sons, separate from those ued for the
loathsome class who frequent the
police court. The class alluded to and
for whom the chnrity is intended are
working people who from unavoidable
causes commence to "tramp" at certain
saa&sns of the year. These have to
accept charity, aud the city, in sharing
the expense and inconvenience of their
entertainment, has set a laudable ex
ample of charity.
In this connection we would call the
attention of Mayor Johuson and the
Board to the fact that the time is at
baud when other demands for charity
will be made which can not go un
heeded. We knoar their means-for al
leviating suffering is limited, but some
thing can be done. Then let such be
! dispensed promptly when the emer
gency arises.
Oi B McAllister's X Roads corres
pondent iolorms us that Barton's
Creek tl range held a tobacco fair on
the 4th inst. Premiums were offered
for five classes of tobacco, dark and
very dark wrapper, bright and very

Win. llarvej received the premium tor

Maliciocs Mischief. Last Mon
day night about half past seven o'clock,
some person threw a stone through
the window of the basement room at
tbe residence of M r. Robert Newman,
on the corner of Main street and Uni
versity Avenue. A lamp was burning
j in tte bwemeut, at which the stone is
supposed to have been thrown, but
striking the sash it was diverted from
its object and the lamp was not hit.
Had the lamp been struck it would
very 'ikcly have caused the burning of
the house. This is the second time
stones hava been thrown into this
house, and as such mischief may result
seriously, aside from its - malicious
character, it is time for it to be stop
ped. The Best Family Newspaper.
This is the claim which the publish
ers of the New York Observer make
in behalf of their paper. It is a bold
claim to make in our day, when there
are so many papers; but an undeviating
course in sending out, for fifty-three
years, a large, full, fresh, readable, and
pure newspaper, which is unsurpassed,
justifies them in the claim. We can
recommend the Observer. It has no
hobbies ; it is sound in doctrine, im
partial and unbiased, reliable in its
news, interesting and instructive in its
various departments, and offers no
clap-trap premiums or pictures. For
specimen copies, address S. I. Prime
& Co., New York.
Respect to the Dead. The funer
al of the late H. M. Atkins, at the
M. E. Church, last Saturday was at

The funeral ceremonies were conduct

which the remaius were followed to

of the Academy prop6se to have a con
cert in their Hall, on Thursday night,

the reception rooms of the Academy.
Admittance 50 cents. To those who
know the ladies engaged in this con
cert it is unnecessary to say anything
farther than the simple announcement
of the time and place, but to those who
j have never had tha pleasure of attend

we would say, go by all means, tor those
who stay away will miss a treat rarely
offered to our citizens.
