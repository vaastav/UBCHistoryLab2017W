ADVENTISTS MIUEIU
XSBL
About the year 1843 a ieet showed it
self in the United Btates, the oornar
Btone of whose belief was that things
mundane were to be brought to n ab
rupt termination. . The sect was headed
by a man named Miller, who lived in
Washington county, Mo., some forty-fire
years ago, and worked in the lead mines
and aronnd the smelting works in that
county. He was noted as a great student
equal to Thomas Benton in that re
spectand as reticent as President
Grant. He was a constant reader of the
Eible, and was known to be engaged in
the solution of some stupendous mathe
matical problem, but what it was no one
was ever able to ascertain. The enun
ciation of Millerism some years after
solved the mystery so fat' as Miller's ec
centric conrse was concerned; but Mil
ler and his followers, as all are aware,
were disappointed in their expectations,
and were ridiculed by both press and
people. Undismayed by the contumely
which had been visited upon Millerism,
the Second Adventists a name the sect
has since taken set another time for the
destruction of the world. How many
times their predictions have come to
naught we are not advised, but they
seem undaunted, for it was only
during the month of Novem
ber that these Second Adventists
arrayed for a departure for another
world. According to an account pub
lished in the Boston Globe, en Terry's
Island, in the Connecticut river, about
17 miles above Hartford, this strange
sect assembled some weeks since, to the
number of about 60, to await the second
advent of Christ. In auswer to a re
porter's inquiry, D. C. Terry, who owns
most of the Island, said: "We expect
the Lord to come in November. We are
assembled here for prayer and praise,
and to await His coming. We have no
objections to visitors, if they do not
come to scoff and turn our worship into
ridicule. We are happy to answer any
questions and satisfy any who doubt our
sanity or our grounds of belief." The
Globe concludes its very interesting ac
count of this singularly imperturbable
people by saying that
There was no indication of poverty
among these forest-worshippers. They
were plainly yet neatly dressed. There
was nothing grotesque or ludicrous in
their manners or appearance. They are
certainly the calmest, most mathemati
cal enthusiasts ever seen. Tbe services
were simple and unmarked by any en
thusiasm or excitement. They do not
shout as Methodists do, and their hymns
are sung by trained vooalistB who under
stand mnsio. They began with prayer
three of the men following each other in
devotion. They prayed, not as other
denominations do, for any temporal
blessing; they invoked the Holy Sprit,
and prayed for faith, and expressed their
gratitude to God for giving them a
knowledge of the truth, and faith to be
lieve it.
One of the Adventists told the reporter
that they were not believers in the im
mortality of the soul, nor in a place of
eternal punishment. The gift of immor
tality is only for tbe believers in Christ.
All other human beings are mortal,
finite, and death to them is eternal annihilation.
of murder ought not to pass unnoticed.
The man who is willing to risk $5,000
on the possibility of sv publie official's
speedy assassination, and the editor who
desires to see the wager won, ought both
be put under a close surveillance that it
will not be possible for them very easily
to secure the consummation for which
they are so desirous.
Chist Jcsnci. Onr advices from
Washington are to tbe effect that Presi
dent Grant will to-day send to the Senate
the nomination of George H. Williams,
of Oregon (present Attorney-General) ss
Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of
the United States to fill the vacancy
caused by the death of Chief Justice
Chase. The appointee is nndoubtedly
an improvement on Conkling, and for
this reason we are glad the appointment
is to be made, yet is he probably not the
equal of Everts, Curtis or Keverdy John
son." Judge Williams is a citizen of Ore
gon, from men Mate ne was a senator
in Congress for a full term of six years.
He was by President Grant appointed
Attorney-General of the United States
about two years ago. He bears the rep
utation of a high-minded gentleman and
sound lawyer.
Annivibsibt of tbe Gkakoees. On
the 4th of December, 18GG, tbe first
Grange of the Patrons of Husbandry was
organized at Washington City, D. C. It
appears from official statements made
that on the 25th of October there were
7,577 subordinate Granges in the vari
ous States and Territories thirty-two of
the States and three of the Territories
having Granges. No State or Territory
of the thirty-two States has leu than
four, and Iowa having as many as 1,823.
From the 1st of January to the close of
September, 1873, the number of Granges
opened wss 5,123.
California Lsoislattbi. It appears
from our dispatcheB that M. 31. EsU,
of San Francisco, elected as an Inde
pendent, has been chosen Speaker of the
Assembly, but by what vote we are as
yet unadvised. Mr. Estee was an origi
nal Republican, but came over to Gree
ley lust Fall. His election looks as if a
combination had been formed between
the Independents and the Democrats,
which will insure the election of Booth
to the Senate without a doubt. -
San Fbancisco, Dec. 2. George Treat,

A London dispatch dated at 3 p. ru.
gives the following additional news:
The Ville de Havre was struck amidships
by tbe English ship Lochine, end sunk
in twelve mtnntes. Tbe Lochine got out
her three boats and stood by the spot all
morning, picking op survivors. It was
not until the morning of the same day that
she fell in with tbe Tri-rnountain, bound
to England, to whom she transferred her
passengers. The Lochine was so badly
damaged by the collision that persons
rescued by her requested to be put on
tbe Tri-mountain. The Lochine put
about for Queenstown, at which port she
was due about the 29th ult. Nothing
yet heard of her.
Washisotox, Dec. 2. During the ses
sion of the Cabinet to-day, the President
formally tendered to Attorney-General
Williams the position of Chief Justice of
the Supreme Court.
Colonel BriBtow, of Kentucky, will be
appointed Attorney-General. The nom
inations will be sent to tbe Senate to
morrow. A Xew Pope Selected.
The London Hour says it has trust
worthy information that by the privately
expressed wish of Pius Ninth, the Cardi
nals have been in consultation and se
lected Cardinal Pecci, Archbishop of
Perugia, for the next Pope. He was
born in 1810, and became a Cardinal in
1852. He is a hard-working bishop, and
is called an ultra montanlist, but would
no doubt live on terms of amity with the
Italian Government. All free thinkers
of Italy greatly respect Cardinal Pecci,

Strength of the Akmt. General
Sherman, in his report to the Secretary
of War, says the number of enlisted men
in the army is 490 less than the 30,000
limited by law in active regiments. The
number of men sick and on necessary
details about posts will fully equal
twenty-five per cent., so that the actual
strength for military service does not
exceed 19,052 men. The General fur
ther says:
In order that tbe regular army should
fulfil its arduous duties on the frontier,
us also to form a model on which to
shape volunteers and the militia force of
the United States, I earnestly recom
mend that Congress be asked to fix the
limit of enlisted force at such a figure as
will give 30,000 for regiments ot line,
and to provide specially for non-combat-tant
detachments, such as an engineer
battalion, ordinance department, West
Point detachments, and signal ordin
ance. Artillery regiments have an
organization different from tbe in
fantry in this; they have twelve bat
teries to a regiment; of these only one is
eouirJDed and constructed as a batterv nf
artillery, the other eleven companies of
each regiment being armed with muskets
ana instructed as infantry. The regi
mental commissioned officers on dutv. or
belonging to the several departments and
divisions, number, in tbe aggregate, 1,
582; of present for dnty, 1,234; absent on
leave, or detached, 298. The foregoing
does not include 31 second lieutenants
recently appointed from civil life, and
under orders to ioin their reciments.
The military division embrace the whole
area of the United States, and their re
ports forwarded to the Secretary of War
include the acts of all of the regular
uruiy.
Ho part of the army General Sherman
says, is under his immediate control, and
the existing army regulations devolve on
the Secretary of War, as does the actual
command of the military, therefore he
forbears making any further recommen,
dations on the report.
Lawless Joubnausm. A newspaper
published at Lexington, Mo., contained
recently a letter, dated at St. Louis, Oc
tober 1, and signed by one H. Clay Har
per, in which the writer offers to bet
$5,000 that President Grant will be as
sassinated before the 10th day of April,
1874. The editor comments upon the
letter by saying: " We have only to add
that it will afford us profound pleasure
to announce on the morning of April 11,
that Mr. Harper has won his bet." It is
sufficiently shocking to offer a wager
upon the issue of which the life of
human being depended, but to express
wish that such a wager might be won by
a party making it, is simply atrocious.
The Journalist, commenting upon the
remark of the Lexingtoa editor, says
' That editor is probably a firm believer
in ine iiDerty ot tbe press, and were nis
sheet to be proceeded against as it de
serves, would set up a cry against the
suppression of free speech. But at the
same time he is about as ignorant in re
gard to what liberty of speech is ss he is
ignorant of a more than limited amount
of information as to the requirements of
civilisation. Such an open advocation
Particulars of Ike Villa
Disaster.
New 'oee, Dec. 1. The Tribune c
ble, special from London, says the first
purser ot the steamer Villa de Havre gives
the following account of the disaster:
The steamer was struck on the starboard
side; the main mast and rigging were
carried away) the long boat was not
crushed on deck, but after being lowered
the mizzen mast fell upon it and killed
nearly all its occupants. The main mast,
after the mizzen most, toppled over on the
deck, killing many persons. In a few
minutes the ship began to sink, amidst
great disorder, panic and terror. The
scene was awful beyond description. Tbe
air was rent with shrieks, but some were
heard saying, "as wo must die, let us die
nobly." Water rushed into the hold with
incredible velocity. I undressed myself,
and with a companion, jumped overboard
and swam toward the Lochine, then half
a mile distant to the left. I heard the
ship cracking, and looking around saw
her go down with one plunge forward.
For a moment the shrieks were terrible;
then all was silent. It was tbe sentence
of death. The Captain remained on the
Villa de Havre during the whole time
and went down with the ship. He was
picked up an hour afterward. All the
officers who were rescued were saved in a
similar manner, except the First Lieu.
tenant, whom the Captain Beut to the Lo
chine to see if she was in a sinking con.
dition, or if she were able to receive the
passengers of the Villa de Havre. I swam
half an hour and finally reached the Lo
chine, but missed ropes thrown to me
and remained in the water for another
quarter of an hour, but was eventually
rescued. Among the passengers on the
deck of the Ville de Havre was a French
gentleman of remarkable coolness
and presence of mind. He com.
forted msny by bis Words. A priest
asked, "Are you a Roman Catb
ohet "Yes. 1 was tbe answer.
Repent, then," said the priest, "and I
will forgive yonr sins." With the last
words the priest sank in the waves and
the penitent was saved. The boats
crossed and re-crossed the scene of the
disaster, searching for survivors until 10
a. tn., when further efforts were aban
doned as hopeless. The survivors re
mained on the Lochine until 8 p. m.,
when they were transferred to the Tri
Mountain. ' 1 '

San Francisco, Dec. 2. President
Grant's message is reoeived. In it he
speaks of our great national prosperity
and of the financial crisis which has
brought low the fortunes of many. Po
litical partnership has almost ceased to
exist, especially in the agricultural re.
gions, and the capture on the high seas
of a vessel bearing our flag, and which
for a time threatened most serious conse
quences is in course of peaceful settle
ment. Our relations with all other na
tions continue friendly. He speaks fa
vorably of the showing made by American
exhibitors at the Vienna Exhibition. He
is pleased to announce that the Emporer
of China had recoived the deplomatic
representatives of the western powers in
person, and says some progress has been
made in the direction of suppressing the
Coolie Trade. Ho thinks further legis
lation on this subjeot may be needed.
He transmits an application of the Re
public of San Domingo to the United
States to exercise a protectorate over that
island, but makes no recommendation in
that ease. He invites the earnest at,
tention of Congress to the existing
laws of the United States respecting
American citizens abroad. He wants
CongreBS to point out a way in which
American citizens may elect another na
tionality in foreign countries Bhould
they desire to rennounce their allegiance
to this Government. He counsels for
bearance on onr part in the matter of
our claims against Veiiezuala nnder the
award of 18G6.

The body of Harry Hudson, ot the

Chief Cockrill has issued stringent
orders for the suppression of houses of

Thi Virginia Enterprise says: The
volcano mentioned in our telegriphic
dispatches as having broken oat near
Eureka, will probably turn out on close
inspection as did the Mount Butler vol
cano, near this city, a few years since a
mere surface fire. Our volcano was the
burning of a mass of pitcby vegetable
matter which had scounmlated cave
in tbe rocks at the top of the mountain.
Pine twigs, leaves and other matter con
tainiug pitch are carried into these caves
by rsts and squirrels and in the course
of ages there is a vast accumulation of
pitch (it beiug almost indestructible)
and rotten vegetable matter. This, on
being set oo fire, will burn for days,
sending out great volumes of smoke.
Tbere was a few years since, such a fire
in a cave near Lake Tahoe, another in a
large cave in the Humboldt country, and
we hare heard of them in other places.
The gummy substance found in these
caves might be passed off on a "pilgrim"
for lava, but it comes much nearer being
guano, of animal origin.
; Or the two unknown men, found dead
by L. H. York and a companion in the
Death Valley region recently, we clip the
following from the Virgiuia Chronicle:
Bidinc nn tn the SDring. York and his
companion found two white men lying
upon the ground, stripped to their araw
ers, and quite dead. Tbeir skulls had
been broken in, and tbeir throats cut,
and tha warm blood was still oozing
from the ghastly wound in the throat of
one of them. Not a scrap of paper or
clothing (other than tbeir drawers) could
be found, and no clue to their identity
could be obtained. One of tbe men ap
peared to have been a miner and pros
pector, and the other a man unused to
exposure; and the supposition is that
one was a prospector proceeding to
Death Vallev to show some ledges to tbe
other, who is supposed to have been a
speculator or expert. The bodies were
Duried tozotner in a gray Dinnset, near
the spring, and neither York or his
whilom companion have ever been able
to learn anything of tbe prtvious nis-
tory of toe niuruered tut-u.
Michael Mobiabty, the young
who waded about among the coin and
checks upon a faro table a few nights
since, who assaulted the officers and who
was arrested therefor, finally grew so bad
that there was no longer any doubt about
his insanity. Believing it would be for
his benefit his brother-in-law night before
last, savs the Virginia Entemrise of Sat
urday, started East with him. He will
be taken to the residence of his parents
in Massachusetts. At the time he was
examined here Dr. Berthier gave it as his
opinion that he was not wholly ngnt in
his mind thoucb not actually insane
and stating that be was liable to grow
worse instead of better. His friends in
the city soon found they could do but lit
tle witn mm.

ginia Chronicle says: Things look lively
along the line of onr famous tunnel, par
ticularly at the mouth, where a force of
