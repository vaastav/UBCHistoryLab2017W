MRS. THAW WEDDED AGAIN
ONLY LATELY DIVORCED.
former Wife of PitUburger Mar
ried to J. Dodridge Peet.
Mrs. Edward Marsh Thaw, who divorced her
husband. Edward Marsh Thaw, of Pittsburg, a
* t fx weeks ago, was married last night to J.
Dodridge Peet, wao lives at the Republican
Club The marriage ceremony was performed
br a Presbyterian minister, whose name was
carefully lonccaled.
Guests began to arrive last n?ght at the Euclid.
Broadway and Sftth-st.. where Mrs. Thaw lives.
«t 7 o'clock. Her apartments, which are the
finest in the building, were beautifully deco
rated with flowers. The first guest to come
was Mrs. Coykenrdali, who lives in the Dakota,
72d-st. and Central Park West, and is Mrs.
Thaw's particular friend. Numerous cabs and
carriages followed, and all were Immediately
dismissed.
Mr. Pe3t and Mrs. Thaw took every precau
tion to keep the affair from the prying eyes of
reporters. In the morning Mr. Peet visited th©
bulldog and handed $20 to each bellboy and
servant. To the superintendent he gave an
order for a dining room set. worth $200. He
rave the cabman who drove him to his wedding
55 and afterward dismissed him with $2.
"Cabby" said that he couldn't talk after such
treatment.
The reporter from The Tribune found in the
anteroom two young women, who laughingly
informed him that Mrs. Thaw and Mrs. Coyken
dal! had left town several days ago.
The employes seemed much worried by the
presence of the newspaper men. At 9:20 they
turned out the lights In the shelter extending
from the steps to the curb to drive the reporters
away. Th» seventy-five guests seemed as much
warned by the reporters as the servants, for
they appeared in numbers at the windows every
few minutes and looked out anxiously. None
of the servants were allowed to see the guests.
None of the other occupants of the house wen?
allowed a peep either. They were extremely
curious, since Mrs. Thaw's presence in the house
has always been kept a mystery to them, but
they were kept in the dark.
The wedding march — of the only description
Bten by outsiders— began at 10:30 o'clock. Sud
denly, with at least seven shrieks of merriment,
a plump young woman in pink came bounding
off the steps of the house, kicking her pink feet
joyously Into the air. A cab hurriedly drew up
to the curb. The bride, in travelling clothes, fol
lows dthe woman in pink, and the bridegroom
followed her on the arm of a young man. The
couple were bundled into the vehicle, and a
bandbox of confetti was tossed over their heads.
Then the carriage dashed off. and the young
man grabbed the pink woman about the waist
and whirled her bark into the house. A few
minutes later two young men came down. He
had a j trangely stiff arm, and, on investigation,
it was learned that he had a champagne bottle
pushed up his sleeve.
Few carriages returned for the guests, and
most of them left on the street cars.

PATRICK'S BACK TO WALL
CASE TO SUPREME COURT.
Makes Appeal for Life — Death
Ordered in January.
A. T. PATRICKS FIGHT FOR LIFE.
Arrested October 4, 1900.
Trial began January 20, 1902.
Convicted March 26. 1902.
Put in death house at Sing Sing April 7,
1902.
Court refuses new trial June 9, 1905.
Execution set for August 7, 1905.
Resentenced to die December 6.
To appeal to United States Supreme Court.
A crowd that filled every seat in the court
room of the Criminal Branch of the Supreme
Court yesterday afternoon, heard Albert T. Pat
rick plead his own case before Justice Rogers,
arguing unsuccessfully against the motion for
a resentence to death in the electric chair.
Here was the man convicted of the murder of
William Marsh Rice, and sentenced to death
nearly four years ago, who spent more than
three years in. the death house in Sing Sing
working- and studying to aid the lawyers who
.managed his case on appeal, fighting for a little
more delay when the Court of Appeals had
given a second and final decision against him.
Excepting for a slight prison pallor, Patrick
looked as well as when he was on trial, although
there was a report that he was near collapse at
Sing Sing earlier in the day. He arrived in the
city early In the afternoon, guarded by two
prison keepers, and was taken at first to the
County Court House, before Justice Stover, who^
decided that the motion for a resentence should
be heard in the Criminal Branch by Justice
Rogers. Patrick enjoyed a walk up Centre-st.,
carrying some of the legal documents in his caso
and talking with Edward J. Kohler, who is as
sociated with ex-Governor David B. Hill as his
counsel.
Some delay in the Patrick case before Justice
Rogers was i aused by the closing of the trial
of Thomas P. \Y:eke.s and there was an inter
ruption in the argument of Mr. Kohler when
the Jury brought in a verdict of guilty in, th^
Wickes case.
District Attorney Jerome reviewed the Patrick
case briefly and a«=ked Justice Rogers to fix a
new date for execution of sentence. Mr. Kohler
objected, arguing that the court had no jurisdic
tion to resentence Patrick and applying for a
stay of proceedings pending an appeal which
Mr. Hill is to take before the United States
Supreme Court on constitutional grounds. Mr.
Kohler talked about two hours, making a tech
nical argument, which seemed to have no effect.
Justice Rogers seemed to be growing impatient
when Mr. Kohler raised the point that there
was new evidence to shov that the conviction of
Patrick had been obtained by fraud. Mr. Kohler
was proceeding to recite the evidence, when
District Attorney Jerome, evidently wanting to
bring the long argument to a close, consented
to have all the evidence submitted made part
of the court record.
It was then that Patrick rose and made
known his intention to speak In his own behalf.
"Before your honor decides this matter.'' he
said, "I have several \iews I would like to give
to the court which, I think, will be understood
readily."
The surprise of Justice Rogers was apparent,
: and he asked: "Do you want me to set aside the
i decision of the higher courts?"
Mr. Kohler asked for a_brief consultation with
' Patrick and then said that Patrick, who was a
lawyer, was bent on making a statement against
I the advice of his counsel. When Patrick saw
•he was to have a hearing, he smiled. He rose
1 and began to talk with the air of a lawyer
' pleading an ordinary case. He said:
May It please youV honor the court, no one bet
ter than 1 understands more about reckless words,
md I am no) going to rehash this entire cose.
Arvirnng I say mutt !<• said wttnin the scope of
the law. .in.! I am not going to urge anything I m
not entitled to in law.

: on newly discovered evidence, in which we con
tended that the judgment hjui been fraudulently

1 of Appeals took up the case, ii took judicial cos
' nieance of thai motion and denied It. After that

COX ON SPEAKEHSHIP.
Assemblyman Thinks Independent
Record Weakens His Chances.
In a somewhat satirical vein Assemblyman
Robert L,. Cox. of Buffalo, yesterday discussed
his candidacy for the Speakership of the Assem
bly. In the main, Mr. Cox's talk was a discus
sion of the reasons found In his legislative career
that made him "ineligible" from the point of
view of the politician. First of these, Mr. Cox
asserted, was his service on the present legis
lative insurance investigating committee.^ He
regarded the work of this committee as haidiy
likely to commend any of its members to poli
ticians, and expressed the rather surprising view
that there might be difficulty In passing the
legislation It is to recommend, and to which he
would ba pledged. His determination to forca
the passage of amendments of substantial char
acter of the Corrupt Practices law, making cor
porate contributions to campaign funds im
possible, he regarded as a further handicap.
Finally he pointed out that during his three
previous terms he has been ranked aa ar. iv-
ASSEMBLYMAN ROBERT LTMAN COX.
Candidate for Speaker.
dependent and has refused to accept or support
bills merely because they bore the "party meas
ure tag." For these and other reasons. Mr. Cox
declared that, while he was a candidate, he be
lieved he was destined to be elected "chairman
of the committee on lonesome places."
When Mr. Cox was asked about his candidacy
he said:
To tell the truth, I don't quite see how I can
hope to win out In this fight. 11 I am to be
selected at a", it must be on my record and not
on promises of future services or statements
of future policies. Now, as a legislator in past
years, as my colleagues know. I have been
classed as a "kicker" too i Cten to have achieved
any great popularity with party leaders. I nave
insisted on applying my oT.n standards to legis
lation rather than accepting the certificate
furnished by others and known as the "party
measure tag."
Such action. I am afraid, has been more or less
temperamental, and would, therefore, be likely
to continue and possibly might be even more
troublesome if I become Speaker than if 1 re
mained a mere ordinary member on the floor.
X » less a source of weakness, I apprehend, i**
the fact that I have more often opposed than
assisted th« passing of legislation. I have al
ways believed that most of the laws put on the
statute books could much more advantageously
have been left off. As a result. I have contrib
uted to keeping not ■'. few proposed measures off
the statute books, and the legislative friends of
such bills have learned to dislike in.- for my op
position. .
Again, I have protested, and must continue to
protest, against corporate control of certain
classes of legislation at Albany. The work of
the Insurance Investigating committee has fur
nished in detail reasons why the next legis
lature must pass Insurance legislation this win
ter. It has also indicated reasons why the pas
sago of such legislation may bo difficult. I
Imagine that my part In the work of this com
mittee has not added anything to my "avail
ability" as a Speakershlp candidate in certain
quarters of great influence, because the Speaker
will appoint the chairmen of the various im
portant committees.
But insurance is not the only Important field
in which the next legislature must work I be
lieve that there must be substantial amend
ments to the Corrupt Practices act, not mere
ly forbidding corporate contributions to cam
paign funds, but also providing for much greater
publicity of receipts and expenditures. I don't
need to emphasize the point that such laws are
not primarily going to affect nor principally in
terest religious and charitable institutions or
organizations.
"Are you to be regard* as r.n anti-Odell
candidate?" Mr. Cox «as asked.
"Well, rhat's a good suggestion, but I think
It would be more to th. point hi say I was an
'Odell-anti candidate.' "
Assemblyman Cox la one of the two Repub
lican Assemblymen who survived the Demo
cratic tidal wave In Buffalo this year. He has
been ranked as one of the independent mem
bers of the Assembly. His name has never
been connected with any legislative "grab bills"
or questionable measures. Party alignment has
never prevented him from attacking measures
in the Assembly, and he has befn one of the
most aggressive independents of the lower
House. Mr. Cox voted for the removal of Jus
tice Warren B. Hooker. In former years, when
Erie County had a larger Republican repre
sentation in the Assembly, he was recognized
as it* leader.
THE DELEGATION WATCHING IMMIGRANTS.
COREY DIVORCE SOUGHT.
President of Steel Trust Admits
Differences with Wife.
W. E. Corey, president of the United States
Pteel Corporation, admitted yesterday that "ir
reconcilable differences"' existed between him
self and Mrs. Corey, which, probably, had led
her to seek a divorce. Mrs. Corey at present is
at Reno, Nev., where she Is establishing a legaj
residence. She has declined to discuss the di
vorce question.
Mr. Corey said U'tle ecncen,:ng the actress
whose name has \>een coupled with his own In
giving the reasons for lira. Corey's seeking a
divorce. He had known for a long time this
woman, bfe said, but any suggestion of Impro
priety in their acquaintance would be a great
injustice.
A formal statement was issued by Mr. Corey
as follows:
The subject matter of recent publications per
sonal to myself and some others Is of such a
painful character that I have hesitated to say
anything in regard to it, and have perhaps been
unjust to myself and to the press in declining to
admit the whole truth when questioned. How
ever, in view, of what has been published, I have
decided to nuike statement which covers the
situation^*' 'i" -40' this more to protect the good
name of othej> than my own.
Mrs. Corey and I have had disagreements.
Our differences are Irreconcilable. I have been
informed, and believe, she is residing in Nevada.
She may have contemplated a divorc". and if

TRY TO BLOW UP SCABS'
Dynamite Found on Bridge Where
X&i-Union Men Worked.
[By Telegraph to The Triburw.l
New-Haven, Conn , Dec. fi. — An attempt was
made some time on Monday morning or Sunday
night to wreck the new steel Kimberly-ave.
bridge, over West River, and to kill or mangle
the twenty-five non-union workmen who are
employed on it by an explosion of dynamite at
the New-Haven end of the bridge. The bridge
connects New-Haven and West Haven, and has
been the source of considerable litigation and
trouble.
A strike of the bridge workers occurred
!nst July, and up to a month ago no work was
done there. On November -<"> strike breakers
were put to work on the structure. They had
worked with fair success. The cartridges were
found in a holler, before they had been exploded.
They arc now said to be in the bands of the
Sheriff. The detective force of New-Haven, as
well as the authorities of Orange, are trying to
trace the; person*! who placed them there.
The cartridges, If is understood, would not ex
plode in fii :<>ns being need to set them
off. The explosions of the caps on the cartridges
would set them off, it is said by experts.
POLICE GUARD BOY HEIR.
Kidnapping of Youth Who Will

HiUsdale, X. .7.. Dec. 6.— Charles Arthur Hins
ir.. who is said to be, after bis father, the
chief heir to a $2,000,000 estate In England, Is
■' the most closely guarded buys ir: thi>
United States. He is never out of sight of Bert

This state of affairs has been in progress for
some weeks, and will last for some months
more, as the boy's father is about to sail for
England. Several attempts, it is said, have
been made to kidnap the boy, who Is thirteen
years old.
Mr. Hinsman, the father of the boy, when seen
at Hackensack last night, said:

Report That McCall Will Soon
Retire from the N. Y. Life.
A DAY'S INSURANCE DEVELOPMENTS
The legislative committee agreed that
Thomas F. Ryan be asked to testify next
week.
Senator Chauncoy M. Depew resigned his
directorship in the Equitable.
The Mutual Life Trustees adopted many
amendments to bylaw*.
The rumor was revived that Controller
Grout may b3 president of the Mutual Life.
It was affirmsd that President McCall of
the New-York Life would resign before tha
next annual election.
Thirteen men were elected or re-elected as
directors at the Equitabls's annual election.
The insurance committee found many curi
ous instances of heavy assessments in the
Mutual Reserve.
The examination of the Security Mutual
of Binghamton revealed a striking instance
of nepotism and of an unlimited salary.
Thomas F. Rvan. who bought James Hazen
Hyde controlling stock In the Equitable, will
be asked to testify before the legislative com
mittee, next week. This was definitely decided
on ai a meeting of the committee on Tuesday
night. Mr. Ryan will be asked incidentally as
to the reason of his payment of $2,500,000 for
Stock ostensibly worth only a fraction of that
sum. and also just what are his intentions as
to the future of th« Equitable. Mr. Ryan's tes
timony is looked forward to with keen Interest
in insurance circles.
It i? slid that yesterday's meeting of the
trustees of the Mutual Life was the occasion
of a hot fight between adherents of the Trues
dale committee and their opponents over the
proposed amendments to the bylaws.
The meeting resulted, apparently, in a victory
for the rmesdale committee, the proposed
amendments and the committee's report being
adopted. The announcement that the trustees
would meet again to-morrow caused wide spec
ulation. It is said, further that a sub-com
mittee was appointed to choose a compromise
candidate for the presidency.
At the close of the meeting Acting President
Cromwell, who is said to represent the financial
committee, stated that no successor to Presi
dent McCurdy had been chosen. He said noth
ing had been done at all as to the presidency
question, but declined to state. whether the ques
tion had been discussed at the meeting.
It is said that the reason why no president was
chosen was because of a deadlock among the
trustees aa to the candidate. One faction of the
society, it is reported, headed by George F.
Baker and Henry H. Rogers, is in favor of
Charles A. Peabody for president, Mr. Peabody
being opposed by other trustees under the lead
ership of Stuyvesant Fish and Klbridge T
Gerry. Mr. Cromwell said that the principal
business of the meeting was the passing of the
amended bylaws. These, Mr. Cromwell Baid.
were nil passed unanimously. Mr. Cromwell
wished 11 to be known that all the trustees were
working In perfect harmony.
"Any surmise as to any differences between
the trustee.-." added Mr. Cromwell, "Is without
foundation."
Mr. Cromwell denied that any demand that
Robert H. McCurdy be sup*>rs«>ded had enmo up
at the meeting.
It is believed that the Mutual Life's failure
to select a president yesterday will increase the
chances of Controller Grout. Mr. Grout, it is
said, lias assured certain trustees friendly to his
candidacy that he is willing to accept th* office
on his retirement from the Controller's chair.
Controller Grout's candidacy was indicated ex
( lusivelj :n The Tribune several dav
it was declared yesterday that John <~laflin
had been asked to succeed John A. McCall as
enl of th<- New-York Ufe. but had re
fused n. While no official or semi-official
ment could be" obtained, it was said that both
Prr-<=b!r-nt McCall and Vice-President George v -
P*erkinfl will soon retire from the company. It
was later reported that Mr. McCall and Mr.
Perkins will submit their resignations at the
trustees' meeting next week, and that already
'] perkti ! ha* tendered bis own resignation.

a Tr)i nstrUed In
insurance circles as Indicating that Mr. Colby
would not be asked to testify before the com
mittee, and that the question of veracity be
tween ex-Governor Benjamin B. Odell and
K. H. Harrimaii on the one hand and James
Hazen Hyde on the .>th»r win r*»m:iin
tied.
Should the committee decide not to ask Mr.
Colby to testify, insurance interests will draw
their own conclusions, pending the publication
of the committee's report.
A Tribunt- reporter asked Mr. Colby yt-sterday
if he had >>.t been subpoenaed by the Armstrong
committee. Mr. Colby said he had not been

people to have patience has been issued. It
points out again the necessity for time to re

Issuance of temporary statutes covering the
guarantees of the manifesto and making them
operative until the National Assembly meets.
The government made an effort to resume th«
post and telegraph services to-day, but it was
a dismal failure, as far as the latter was con
