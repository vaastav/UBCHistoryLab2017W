$116 EARNS
$25,000
. . "The Preseott miner notes
the sale of town lots in Phoenix, lots
being sold for an average price of $48
each. Judge Berry of Preseott
bought the first lot. paying there
for the. sum of $116."
The above is quoted from Page
102, Vol. 6, "History of Arizona" by
T. E. Farish, State Historian.
The $116 lot referred to above is
tho one on the southwest corner of
Washington and First streets, for
merly occupied by the Dorris Groc
ery and is assessed for purposes of
taxation by the city of Phoenix for
slightly over $25,000. It is owned by
City Commissioner J. A. R. Irvine
and could not be purchased for less
than $50,000.
HISTORY WILL RE
PEAT ITSELF
WTiat happened in the early days
of Phoenix will be repeated in COT
TON CITY, located in the heart of
the great Casa Grande valley. When
Judge Berry bought tho lot men
tioned above. Phoenix was just be
ins reclaimed from the wilderness.
The agricultural development of
the adjacent country was confined
to a few hundred acres. The water
supply was limited, a small amount
for irrigating purposes being taken
from the Salt River by crude brush
dams and distributed to the land by
even cruder canals. Phoenix was
not on a railroad not even on a
branch line as it is feday. But
Phoenix thrived and prospered and
grew in spite of all obstacles BE
CAUSE IT WAS SURROUNDED
BY THOUSANDS OF ACRES OF
SPLENDID FARMING LANDS.
Because of these farms the JUG lot
grew in value until today it is worth
at least 50,000. COTTON CITY is
a great deal further advanced to
dfly than Phoenix was then. Where
fthere were a few hundred acres of
farms around Phoenix then there
are thousands of acres around COT
TON CITY today. Where the water
supply around Phoenix then was
limited and uncertain, it is abso
lutely certain and entirely unlimited
at COTTON" CITY. Phoenix at that
time did not even have a branch line
railroad while today the MAIN LINE
of the Southern Pacific runs right
through COTTON CITY 68 main
line trains a day. The surrounding
farms made a success of Phoenix
and they will make an even greater
success of COTTON CITY for the
available acreage is greater and the
soil is richer.
With the history of Arizona before
your eyes with tho lesson to be
derived from the above fresh in your
mind realizing that Cotton City
MUST succeed, as Phoenix did
knowing that 3116 invested in Phoe
nix real estate grew in a few years
into JdO.OOO we offer you your
choice of 50 selected COTTON CITY
lots for $125 each $5 down and 35
a month. In the light of what his
tory teaches, can YOU afford to ne
glect this opportunity.
