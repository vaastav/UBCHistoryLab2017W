THE ARXZCMA
BEPUB
US! CAUSE
OF JAP
Is Understood Finally to Have
Been Removed
E
It Leaks Out That the Late
Agreement Contains an
Understanding That the
Japanese Government Shall
Keep Population Away.
niiiapi, Iee. 14. A special to the
T'i-t ,rd-H-r;i!l from Washington says:
"All Japanese emigration to the United
Stati-s is to be stipi-d by the Japanese
government. When the Jajanese diet
, meets a few weeks hence, Haron Ko
inura. minister of foreign affairs will
make an official announcement that
the government has decided to prohi
bit all immigration to the United States
after a given date.
Thus will disappear the last remain
ing possible cause of trouble between
the United States and Japan. Though
announcement in Tokio may be
. '.ide upon the assumption that the
Japanese government has voluntarily
agreed upon this course, as a matter of
fact, the decision was reached through
fit? long series of negotiations between
Secretary Root and Haron Takahira,
the Japanese ambassador to the United
States. The order of the Japanese gov
ernment will prohibit all immigration,
but will leave travel free, so that mer
chants, students and tourists may vis
it America at will under a passport
agreement with the United States gov
ernment. When the "understanding" between
the United States and Japan as to the
Pacific ocean and Chinese empire was
made up a week or so ago, and the
notes which had been exchanged were
given t- xtually to the world, comment
was made that if our government had
settled these questions and left the im
migration issue unsettled, no very great
progress toward a permanent peace
would have been actually made.
It is a fact that the highest officials
of the two governments viewed the fu
ture with apprehension if the immi
gration question were left undisposed
of. With neither government desiring
war, and each doing all in its power to
:tvoid it, both might nevertheless be
forced into war. The danger was that
there might be anti-Japanese riot in
San Francisco or elsewhere on the Pa
cific coast. - " .
This would sir up popular passion,
both in the United States and Japan.
In this country it tnight easily be fol
lowed by public opinion demanding and
securing enactment by congress of a
Japanese exclusion bill. This, in turn,
would inflame public opinion among
the Japanese. For a long time it has
been believed by the best informed of

THE FORMER'S-AMENDMENT
Proposing to Take Matter
Entirely Out of Executive
Hands-Latter's Communi
cation Holding That Sub
ject Has Been Disposed of.
Washington, Dee. 14 Senator Fora
ker today introduced an amendment to
the biiliiirovliling for the re-enlistment
of the negro troops discharged with
out honor because of their alleged par
ticipation in the affray at Hrowns-
ville, and he addressed the senate com
mittee concerning the amendment. He
proposes In his new measure 10 es
tablish a tribunal consisting of retired
army officers, before whom the evi
dence niav be submitted as to the
guilt of the defendants and before
whom the defendants themselves might
appear to answer the charges.
The measure is no drawn as to prac
tically take out of the hands of the
executive and to give to the tribunal
appointed by congress full authority
to consider the Brownsville question
and by its findings provide for the re
enllstment of the discharged negroes.
Irr addressing the senate, Mr. Fora
ker said that during the summer let
ters had been coming' -v. him from
these discharged negro .idiers declar
ing that detectives were constantly en
gaging them in conversation. The sen
ator spoke of the activities of detec
tives as outlined by his correspondents,
saving that in many cases they went
so far as to take up their dwelling
with the discharged soldiers for the
purpose of securing their confidence
and spying upon their movements.
He approved the ferreting out of
facts, but he declared that there was a
right wav to do it.
Upon the conclusion of Mr. Fora
ker's remarks. Jlr. Culberson asked
that the president's message on the
Brownsville affair be read, and Vice
President Fairbanks directed that it
be done. All the senntors present re
mained in their seats and much inter
est was shown in the document.
A synopsis of the president's mes
sage is as follows:
"Xo the Senate: I enclose herewith
from the secretary of war, transmit
ting a report of the investigation made
by Mr. Herbert J. Brown, employed
by the department in conjunction with
Captain Vt G. Baldwin to investigate
as far as possible what happened at
Brownsville on the 13th and 14th of
August. 19fi. The report and docu
ments contains some information of
value and some statements that are
obviously worthless, but I submit them
in their entirety.
"This report enables ns to fix with
tolerable defnitcness at least some of
the criminals who took the lead in the
murderous shooting of private citizens
at Brownsville. It establishes clearly
the fact that the colored soldiers did
the shooting, but upon this point fur
ther record was unnecessary, as the
fact that colored soldiers did the
shooting had already been established
beyond all possibility of doubt. The
Investigation has not gone far enough
to enable us to determine all the faets
and we will proceed with it, but it has
gone far enough to determine with
sufficient accuracy certain facts of
enough importance to make it advis -
able that I place the report before you. j
"It appears that almost all the mem
bers of Company B must have been
actively concerned in the shooting,
either to the extent of being partici
pants or to the extent of virtually en
couraging those who were participants.
As- to companies C and D, there can
be no question that practically every
man In them must have had knowl
edge that the shooting was done by
some of the soldiers of B troop and,
possibly, by one or twp others in one
of the other troops. This concealment

was of itself a grave offense, which
was greatly aggravated by their tes
tifying before the senate committee
that they were ignorant of what they
must have known.
"Nevertheless, It is to bo said In
partial extenuation that they were
probably cowed by threats usVle by
the more desperate of the men who
bad actually been engaged in the
shooting, as to what would happen to
any one man who failed to protect the
wrongdoers. Moreover, there are c ir
cumstanees tending to show that these
misguided men were encouraged by
outsiders to persist in their course of
concealment and tlenial.
"I feel, therefore, that the guilt of
the men who, after the event, thus
shielded the perpetrators of the wrong
by refusing to tell the truth about
them, though serious, was in part due
to the unwise and improper attitude
of others, and that sninc measure of
allowance should be made for their
misconduct. In other words, I believe
that we can afford to reinstate any
of these men who now truthfully tell
what has happened, give all the aid
they can to fix the responsibility upon
those who are actually guilty, and
show that they themselves had no
guilty knowledge beforehand and were
in no way implicated in the affair,
save by having a knowledge of it at
terwards and refusing to divulge it.
"Under the circumstances, and in
view of the length of time they have
been out of service and their loss of
benefits that would have accrued to
them by their continuous long-time
service, we can afford to treat the
men who meet the requirements given
above as having been sufficiently pun
ished by the . consequences they
brought upon themselves when they
rendered necessary the exercise of dis
ciplinary power, i recommend that a
law be passed allowing the secretary
of war, within a fixed period of time.
say a year, to reinstate any of these
soldiers whom he. after careful exam
ination. finds to have been Innocent
and whom he finds to have done all
in his power to help "bring to justice
the guilty.
"Meanwhile the investigation will be
continued. Results have made it ob
vious that only by carrying on the in
vestigation as the war department has
carried it on, is there the slightest
chance of bringing the offenders to
justice, or of separating, not the innt
cent. for there were doubtless hardly
any innocent, but the less guilty from
those whose guilt was heinous.
"THEODORE ROOSEVELT.
"White House, December 14th. 1908."
Senator Foraker took the floor as
soon as the president's message and ac
companying reports had been read. He
read a letter from Bird Conyers, a dis
charged soldier, who is alleged to have
made a confession to Detective Law
son. In his letter, Conyers speaks of
the visit of Lawson to Monroe, Oa,
where Conyers had been living. Con
yers says he learned that Lawson was
there to "pick" him and that he had a
"high sheriff arrest - Lawson. As
Lawson had not had an opportunity to
have a private talk with Conyers ac
cording to the tatter's letter, it made
him angry and Conyers says Lawson
"told lies." to the sheriff about him.
Mr. Foraker referred caustically to
the colored detective, calling attention
to the fact that his "high sounding,
smooth, logical report- is signed with
his mark," and then adds: "Oh, Mr.
President,, when this thing Is gone to
the bottom of, all honest men will be
ashamed of It."
Taking up the second letter from
Bird Conyers and before reading it.
Senator Foraker said: "This is a little
tedious, perhaps, but I think it is due
to this soldier, due to the truth, and
due to common decency that the story'
be told." Mr. Foraker said the presi
dent's statement concerning this In
vestigation by detectives showed the
propriety of adopting such a provision
as that embodied in his amendment.
"It scorns to me," he said, "That one
of the worst features of this whole un
fortunate business Is that this man
should now be pursued In this way by
secret detectives in the manner I have
described.
Senator Foraker read a letter he had
written to Conyers in which he said:
"The senate would look after the de
tectives who are visiting him."
"That promise will be made good,"
declared Mr. Foraker. "Enough has
been shown to make it the imperative
duty of the senate to create a tribunal
before which these men can go and re
ceive a hearing. Is there any thing
more atrocious than this case against
these men? This is the sixth time they
have been put on trial and five times
they have been acquitted in my
opinion."
Mr. Foraker concluded by declaring
that the president's statement that the
espionage against the soldiers of the
25th regiment vuld be continued, was
an additional reason for some prompt
action by the senate.
