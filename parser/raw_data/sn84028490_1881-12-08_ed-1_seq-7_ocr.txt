I commend the whole mihjpct '

uif(?estion that no Question of irreater

can engage their attention. In
the Supreme Court of the United
States declared unconstitutional the
statutes of certain States which im
posed upon ship owners or consignees

passenger arriving from a foreign coun

Hies against trie expense for the future

Since this decision the expense attend
ine care ami supervision or lui
migrauta has fallen on the States at
whose ports they have landed. As a
large majority of such immigrants im
mediately upon their arrival proceed to
inland States and the Territories to
seek permanent homes, it is manifestly
uiijusi to impose upon tne state, whose
shores they first reach, the burden

and because of the national importance

regaruing trie supervision and transi
tory care of immigrants at the ports of
debarkation. I regret to state that the
people of Alaska have reason to com

the Senate at its last session passed a
bill providing for the construction of a
building for the library of CongTess,
but it failed to become a law. The pro
vision of suitable protection for this
great collection of books and for the
Copyright Department connected with
has become a subject of national im
portance and should receive prompt at
tention.
The report of the Commissioners of
the District of Columbia, herewith trans
mitted.will inform you fully of the
condition of the affairs of the
district. The vital importance of legis
lation for the reclamation and nu
provement of the marshes and for the
establishment of the harbor lines along
the Potomac river front. It is repre
sented that in their present condition
these marshes seriously affect the health
the residents of adjacent parts of the
city, and they greatly mar the general
aspect of the park in which stands the
Washington monument. This improve
ment would add to that park and to the
park south ot the executive Mansion, a
large area of valuable land, and would
transform what is now believed to be a
dangerous nuisance into an attractive
landscape extending to the river front.
They recommend ihe removal of the
steam railway lines from the surface of
the streets of the city, and the location
of the necessary depots in such places
as may be convenient for the public ac
commodation, and they call attention to
the deficiency of the water supply,
which seriously affects the material
prosperity of the city and the health
and comfort of its inhabitants. I com
mend these subjects to your favorable
consideration.
The importance of timely legislation
with respect to the ascertainment and
declaration of the veto for Presidential
electors was called sharply to the atten
tion of the people more than four years
ago. It is to be hoped that some well
denned measure may be devised bt fore
another national election, which will
render unnecessary a resort to any ex
pedien t of a temporary character fort.e

PRESIDENTIAL INABILITY.

hljerti- 's of the people v. ere suggeRted
liv tho nr(ionEed illness of the late
President i.nd bin consequent incapacity
to perforin the functions of his office.
It is provided by the second article of
the Constitution, in the fifth clause of
its first section, that m case of the re
moval of the President from olhce or of
his death, resignation or inability todis
charge tne duties of said office, the same
shall devolve on the Vice President.
What ia the intention of the Constitu
tion in its specification of inability to
discharge the powers and duties of said
office as one of the contingencies which
calls the Vice President to the exercise
oi presidential functions f is the in
ability limited in its nature to long con
tinned intellectual incapacity, or lias It
a broader import? What must be its ex
tent and duration i How must its ex
lsteuce be established? Has the Presi
dent whose inability is the subject of
inquiry any voice in determining
wnetner or not it exists, or is tne de
cision of that momentous and delicate
question confined to the Vice President,
or is it contemplated by the Constitution
that Congress should provide by law
precisely what should constitute inabili
ty, and how and by what tribunal or
authority it should be ascertained? If
the inability proves to be temporary in
its nature, and duriug its continuance
the .Vice President lawfully exercises
the functions of the Executive, by what
tenure does he hold his office? Does he
continue as President for the remainder
of the four years' term, or would the
elected President, if his inability should
cease in the interval, be empowered to
resume his office, and if, having such
lawful authority, he should exercise it,
would the Vice President be therefore
empowered to resume his powers and
duties as such? I do not doubt that
these important questions will receive
your early and thoughtful consideration.
Deeply mipresseu wun ine gravity oi uie

Temperance people often say that nios

of many, but not of Dr. David Kennedy's

Plssssnt letters.
They are sheets of sunshine. A Method
ist clergyman, of Hartford, Con., writes
Dr. David Kennedy, of Rondout, N. Y
that "Favorite Remedy" cured him of
Chronic Liver Disease and Indigestion,
from which he had suffered for a long;
time. This was splendid, but nothing
more than anyone may expect who uses
this medicine. One dollar a bottle is a
small consideration when health is ia
question. The clergyman says he ia
going to introduce Dr. Kennedy s "Favor
ite Remedy" among his people. He can't
do better.
