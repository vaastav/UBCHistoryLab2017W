1,250 prisoners were brought in.
"On acount of a threatened envel

London, Dec. 7, (11:51 a. m.) The
campaign against the main Serbian
armies having been closed, it iR expect
ed General von Gallwltz with his Ger
man forces will join the Bulgarians In
Macedonia in an effort to crush the
French and British armies before they
become much stronger.
Information from Berlin Indicates
that the German forces engaged in the
earlier movements in the Balkans have
bow been detached for the purpose of j
ibarlng in the attack on the Franco-j
British forces along the southern j
Macedonian front. Dispatches from
Athens partially corroborate thi3
theory, as it is reported two German
divisions are cooperating with the
Bulgarians near Strumitza.
There is iittle to report from the
other fronts except the usual minor
operations. The French,' particularly,
are carrying on an energetic bombard
ment of the German lines in the Cham
pagne. Tnrks Excite Interest.
In Mesopotamia the Germans are
beginning to show considerable inter
est in the campaign which is develop
ing in favor of the Turkish allies. It
is reported from Geneva that the Ger
mans under Field Marshal von der
Goltz are preparing an extensive cam
paign, which will be directed toward
tlie Persian gulf by way of Bagdad.
Further impetus is given to peace
talk by the papal consistory, at which
Pope Benedict delivered an address
wiling on the belligerents to make a
Just and Immediate peace.
The effect of the dismissal ot the
German military and naval attaches at
Washington on the German public is
not ascertainable yet, as the German
newspapers have not been permitted to
. Publish even the bare facts of the in
cident. Campaign Is 'H.

Petrograd, Dec. 7, (via London, 7:41

on the ground that the budget com

ced today. As the United States laws
make no provision for this kind of a
customs entry, it is understood Mr.

advisability of amending the customs
laws so as to make special provision
for the entry ot aeroplanes and for

THE WAR TODAY
German participation on a large
scale in the Mesopotamia cam
paign is probable, according to re
ports reaching Switzerland. The
naming of Ffcld Marshal von der
Goltz as commander of the Turk
ish forces in Mesopotamia is com
mented on in this connection.
In some quarters it is surmised
that German efforts against the
British in the east may be direct
ed towards the Persian gulf rath
er than the Suez canal, as has been
hinted.
The general war council of the
entente allies is being continued in
Paris under the presidency of Gen
eral Joffre, French commander-in-chief.
An unconfirmed report that a
Bulgarian infantry regiment mut
inied when ordered to (he Gallip
oili peninsula to tight with the
Tnrks has reached London
through Amsterdam. Three hun
dred of the mutineers are said to
have been shot
Distrust of Greece continues to
be expressed by the press of the
entente powers, notably by French
and Italian newspapers. More vlg
orous measures lo induce Greece
to comply with the allied demands
are again being urged.
According to reports through
Holland, the German lines in
France and Belgium hare been

In Reply to Bernstorff De
mand for Explanation Sec
retary Sends Message.
CAUSED BY ACTIVITIES
Lansing Declares Von Pap
pen and Boy-ed's Con
duct Brought Action.
Washington, Dec. 7. Secreatry Lan
sing has replied to Germany that the
American government's request for
the withdrawal of Captain Boy-ed and
Captain von Papen, the naval and
military attaches, respectively, of the
Germany embassy here, was entirely
because of their military and naval
activiiies.
Secretary Lansing's reply to the
German government's inquiry, which
indicated the Berlin foreigu office in
tended to contest the withdrawal of
the attaches under certain conditions,
was delivered in a long communica
tion which the German embassy im
mediately forwarded to Berlin. At
the embassy all comment on it was
refused.
President Wilson has fully approv
ed Secretary Lansing's decision and
it was said authoritatively today it j
would be adhered to no matter what
Germany does. ' j
Overnight advices from Berlin indi
cated that the Germau government
would withdraw the officers as re
quested, although it might -ptemt-iae,
a bill of particulars. The position
of the state department is that it
will not discuss the facts in the case.
Still Investigating.
The department of justice is still
investigating reports that German
agents were back of alleged plans
for a counter revolution in Mexico, to
be headed by General Huerta. Attor
ney General Gregory said today, how
ever, that no new information on the
subject had been called to 'his atten
tion recently.
One reason why the American gov
ernment will not furnish Germany
with specific reasons for the request
for the recall of Captain Boy-ed and
Captain von Papen is its determina
tion to keep secret the sources of its
information. Reports involving other
men in this country are under investi
gation and these the government does
desire to disclose until it is ready to
take further action.
Berlin People Ignorant of RecalL
Berlin (via London 11:30 a. m.,
Dec. 7). The request received here
from the United States for the recall
of Captain Franz von Papen and Cap
tain Karl Boy-ed, military and naval
attaches respectively of the German
embassy at Washington, will undoubt
edly be complied with in accordance
with diplomatic usages, it is stated.
However, Germany probably will ask
first to be informed of the grounds on
which the United States government
bases the undesirabij of the at
taches. News of the request for the recall
has not been published yet by the Ger
man press.
The above dispatch is the first di
rect word to be received from Berlin
in regard to the probable action of the
German government in response to
the request of the United States for

BERLIN LAUGHS AT

Berlin, Dec. 7 (via London, 2:40 p.

GREECE PLAYING
FOR TIMF. CHARGE
Paris, Dec. 7 (4:35 a. m ) The Ath
ens correspondent of the Matin, in a
dispatch relative to the attitude of
Greece toward the entente powers,
says:
'The government is simply playing
for time, hoping that the entente al
lies will be forced to the sea by the
Austro-Germans and Bulgars. It will
be found in a week or so that an agree
ment between the Greek and the al
lied staffs cannot be reached and that
the government will declare that, not
withstanding Greece's traditional good
will towards the entente powers, it
cannot accede to their demands."

and broad doctrine of Pan-America.
With sharp words he arraigned
American citizens who by their sym

endangered the neutrality of the United
States.
; America. neyeTwltnessed anything
like this before," declared the presi
dent with deep feeling.
Holds Attention.
The president's outline of the plan
for national defense and the need for
them was received in silence by the
senators and representatives, but with
rapt attention. His declaration of a
new Pan-American doctrine was re
ceived with the deepest interest.
"From the first we have made com
mon cause," he said, "with all parti
sans of liberty on this side of the sea
and have deemed it as important that
our neighbors should be free from all
outside domination as that we our
selves should be; have set America -aside
as a whole for the uses of inde
pendent nations and political freedom.'
This reference was greeted with pro
longed applause and was received with
great interest by the Latin-American
diplomats who were present.
Broad Range of Subjects.
Outside of the main points of na

Pan-Americanism the president cover

projects, a rural credit law, ultimate,
independence for the Philippines, con

ures left over from the last congress.
Applauded on Marine Idea.
When the president urged merchant
marine legislation he was loudly ap
plauded and was forced to stop when
he said "It is high time we resumed
our commercial independence on the
high seas." Republicans clapped their
hands vigorously when ne said that

merchant marine for American private
capital must ultimately undertake and
achieve, as it has undertaken and
