"One Forty-Two, tho neformed Messenger
Boy." la by Henry M. Hyde, a Chlcaso
tacwpaper man. IIIh tales of "One 1'orty
Two" have been running from time to time
In the Chicago TrlbUno and have Interested
nd 'amuted thousands of reader. The
Chicago reporter comes to know the sharp
Urchins that reipand to the calls for dis
trict mesaennera, who, while accredited
with being alow, arc the swiftest kind of
'kids." "One Korty-Two" has reformed,
nd details vividly ths various achem3 he
has worked for his own amusement and the
Increase of his own and his chum's
pocket money. Mr, Hyde has caught the
character of the messenger boy, his slung
nd his life to perfection. "One Forty
Two" Is also something of a Sherlock
Holmes, frequently detecting crime and
bringing thV criminal to punishment. The
Illustrations urn clever and the range of
subjects wide. There are sixteen of the re
formed messenger stories, the most Inter
Vatlng being "De Jealous Daisy," "Diamond
Annie," "De Date Note" and "Oiw Forty
Two'" "Norf Side Mash." These few li
lies will give those who have not read Mr.
Hyde's clever conception an Idea of what
the other twelve are like, while the thou
sands of those that have rend the stories
when first published will be glad that they
ean now ecure the collection between
covers. Herbert S. Stone & Co., Chicago.
"The Warden" It. tho first of tlv; trilogy
of ecclesiastical novels which contributed
o greatly, and so Justly, to the fame of
Anthony Trollope, This simple picture of
clerical life In the Kngllsh cathedral town
of Barchwtcr Is painted In the sober tints
suitable to the subject. It la a study In
grisaille, nut the penrls and graya are
often very effective. Tho book Is addition,
ally Interesting to us of a later generation
ns containing tho author's attack on Car
lyle transparently1 disguised as Dr. Peasl
mist Antlcant. The attack Is In rather bad
taste. Trollope was far from happy when
111 an nRgresstve mood, nnd the method
adopted, that of parody, Is, In his hands,
not precisely fortunato. On tho other hand,
I ho Irony with which ho trcnta the vested
internals of the established church and
their administration are delightful. The
charactera of "The Warden" reappear In
"Darchester Towers" and "The Last
Chronicle of Harset." In bringing "The
Warden" out In convenient alio and In a
rhcop edition tho publishers nre conferring
favor upon tho reading public. It Is to
lie hoped that tho publisher will bring out
other of Anthony Trollope'a works In the
rae convenient form. John lane, New

' "A Modern Antaeus" Is lh title nt
new book by the author of "An Kngllsh

the writer Is still a secret. It deals with

Trlatlm Oavney, nicknamed "Tramp," on
account of his vouthfnl wnnriirlntfH. Thin
modern Antaeus la n child of nature, who

the publishers, who recolved tho manuscript
from an Imperturbable Kngllsh literary
agent. They all agree, howovcr. that It Is
an Intensely modern novel of true literary

THE PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE
(Continued from Fifth Page.)
Hon period during which the funds will
In many eases have to be held In trust.
This in the case also with the lands. A
etop should bo put upon the Indiscriminate
permission to Indians to lease their allot
ments. Tho effort should be steadily to
make the Indian work like any other m4n
on his own ground. The marriage laws of
tho Indians should bo made the same as
those nf the whites.
In tho schools the education should be
elementary an largely Industrial. Tho
need of higher education among tho In
dians In very, very limited. On tho reser
vations caro whould bo takon to try to suit
tho teaching to the needs of tho particular
Indian. There Is no use In attempting to
induce agriculture In a country suited only
for cattle raising, where tho Indian should
be uade a stock grower. Tho ration sys
tem, which is,mercly the corral and the
reservation system, Is highly detrimental
to tho Indians. It promotes beggary, per
petuates pauperism and Htiflca Industry. It
In an effectual bnrrler to progress. It must
cbnllnuc'to a greater or lean degree an long
as tribes iyo horded on reservations and have
everything In common. The Indian should
be treated as an Individual like the white
man. During the change of treatment
Inevitable hardships will occur; every effort
should be made to minimize these hard
ships, but we should not because of them
hesitate to make the change. There should
be a continuous reduction In the number
of agencies.
In dealing with the aboriginal races few
things are more Important than to preserve
them from the terrible physical and moral
degradation resulting from the liquor
traffic. We are doing all wo ean to save
our own Indian tribes from this evil.
Wherever by International agreement this
eame end can he attained as regards races
where we do not possess exclusive control,
every effort should bo made to bring It
about.
St, I. on In Kxiinnf linn.
I bespeak the most cordial support froni
the congress and the people for the St.
Louis exposition to commemorate I he 100th
anniversary of the 1-oulnlnna purchase. This
purchase waa the greatest Instance of ex
pansion In our history. It definitely de
cided that we were to become a great con
tinental ropubllc, by far tho foremost power
In the western hemisphere. It Is one of three
or four great landmarks In our history the
great turning points In our development.
It la eminently fitting that all our people
should Join with heartiest good will In
commemorating It and the cltlrens of Bt.
Louln, or Missouri, of all the adjacent
region are entitled to every aid In making
the celebration a noteworthy event in our
annals. We earnestly hope that foreign
nations will appreciate the deep Interest
our country takes In this exposition and our
view of Its Importance from every stand
point and that they will participate In so
cutlng Its succea. The national govern
ment should be represented by a full and
complete set of exhibits.
Ctiarleatoii Kxixtaltlui).
The people of Charleston, with great en
ergy ami civic spirit, are carrying on an ex
position which will continue throughout
most ,of tho present session of congress.
I heartily commend this exposition to the
good will of the people. It deserves all
the encouragement that can be given It.
The managers of the Charleiton exposition
have requested the cabinet officers to place
thereat the government exhibits which have
been at nuffalo, promising to pay the neces
ary expenses. I have taken the responsl
olllty of directing that this be doue, for 1
feel that It Is due Charleston to help It tn
Its praiseworthy effort. In my opinion
the management should not be required t
pay all these expenses. I earnestly recom
mend that the congress appropriate at once
the small sum necessary for this purpose.

The Pan-American exposition at tluffato
has Just closed. Doth from the Industrial
tnd the artistic standpoint this exposition
tas been in a high degree creditable and
useful, not merely to nuffalo, but to the
United States, The terrible tragedy of the
president's assassination Interfered ma
terially with Its being a flnunctal success,
The exposition was peculiarly In harmony
with the trend of our public policy, because
It represented an effort to bring into closer
tou6h all the peoples of the western hemi
sphere and give them an Increasing sense of
unity. Such an eiTort was a genuine serv
ice to the entire American public,

The advancement of the highest Interests
of national science and learning and the
custody of objects of art and of the valu
able results of scientific expeditions con
ducted by the United States have been com
mitted to tho Smithsonian Institution, in
furtherance of its declared purposa for the
"Increaso and diffusion of knowledge among
men" the congress has from time to time
given It other Important functions. Such
trusts have been executed by the Institution
with notable fidelity. There should be no
halt In the work of the Institution, In ac
cordance with the plans which Its secretary
has presented, for the preservation of the
vanishing races of great North American
animals In the National Zoological park.

Perhaps the most characteristic educa
tional movement of the past fifty years Is
thai which has created the modern public
library and developed It into broad nnd
active service. There arc now over 5,000
public libraries In tho United Stales, tho
product of this period, In addition to ac
cumulating material, they are also ntrlvlng
by organization, by Improvement In method,
and by co-operation, to give greater effi
ciency to the material they hold, to make
It more widely useful, and by avoidance of
unnecessary duplication In process to re
duce tho cost ot Its administration.
In these efforts they naturally look for
assistance to the federal library, which,
though still the library of congress, and so
entitled, is tho one national library of the
United States. Already the largest single
collection of books on the western hemi
sphere, and certain to Increaso more rapidly
than any other through purchase, exchange
and the operation of the copyright law, thin
library has a unique opportunity to rentier
to the libraries of this country to Ameri
can scholarship service of the highest im
portance. It Is housed In a building which
In the largest and most magnificent yet
erected for library uses. Hcsources are
now being provided which will develop the
collection properly, equip It with the ap
paratus and service necessary to Its effect
ive use, render Its bibliographic work
widely available, and enable It to become,
not merely a center of research, but the
chief factor In great co-operative efrorts
for the diffusion of knowledgo and the ad
vancement of learning.

For the sake of good administration,
sound economy nnd the advancement of
science, the census office as now consti
tuted should be made a permanent govern
ment bureau. This would lusuro better,
cheaper and more satisfactory work, In the
Interest not only of our business but of
statistic, economic nnd social science.
Ilurnl Frrp lli-llvrry.
The rcmnrkablo growth of the postal
service In shonn in tho fact that Its reve
nues have doubled and Its expenditures
have nearly doubled within twelve years.
Its progressive development rompolk eon
Rtnntly Increasing outlny, but In this period
of business energy and prosperity lta re
eclpts grow so much faster thun its ex
penses that the annual deficit bus been
steadily reduced rroni $11,411,779 In 1S07 to
$3,923,727 In 1001. Among recent postal
advances the success of rural freo delivery
wherever established has been so marked,
nnd actual experience has mado Its benefits
so plain, that the demand for Its extension
Is general and urgent.
It Is Just that the great agricultural popu
lation should share In the Improvement of
the sorvlce. Tho number of rural routes
now tn operation Is 6,009, practically alt
established within three years, nnd there
are fi.000 applications awaiting action. It
Is expected that tho number in operation
nt tho close of tho current fiscal year w
reach 8,600. Tho mall will then bo dally
carried to tho doors of 0,700,000 of our
people who have heretofore been dependent
upon distant offices, nnd one-third of nil
that portion of tho country which t
adapted to It will be covered by this klud
of service.
Ponlnl Aliunrx.
The full measure of postal progress which
might he realized haa long been hampered
and obstructed by tho heavy burden 1m
poaed on tho government through tho ln
trenched and well understood abuses which
havo grown up In connection with second
class mall matter. Tho extent of this bur
den appears when It In stutcd that whllo the
second-class matter makes nearly tbrco
firthn tho weight of all tho mall, It paid
for tho last fiscal year only $1,204,145 ot tho
aggregate postal revenue ot $111,631,193. If
the pound rate of poRtage, which produces
the large loes thus entailed nnd which was
fixed by the congress with the purpose of
encouraging the dissemination of public In
formation, wero limited to the legitimate
newspapers and periodicals actually con
templated by tho law, no Just exception
could be taken. That expense would be the
recognized and accepted coat ot a liberal
public policy deliberately adopted for a
Justifiable end. Hut much of the matter
which enjoys the privileged rate Is wholly
outside of the Intent of tho law and has
secured admission only through an evasion
of Its requirements nr through lax con
structlnn. The proportion of auch wrongly
Included matter Is estimated by postal ex-
porta to bo one-half of the whole volume of
second-clans mull. It It bo only one-third
or ono-quarter, tho magnitude of the bur
den Is apparent. Tho Postofflce department
has now undertaken to remove the abuses
ho far as is posslblo by a stricter applica
tion of the law and It Hhould bo sustained
In Its effort.
Amr rlcmiH III China.
Owing to tho rnpld growth of our power
and our Interests on the Pnclfle, whatover
happens In China must bo of tho kconcst
national concern to us.
The general terms of tho settlement of
the questions growing out of the antl-for
clgn uprisings In China of 1900, having
beer, formulated In a Joint note addressed
to China by the representatives ot tho In
jured powerH In December last, wero
promptly accepted by the Chinese govern
'inent. After protraeted conferences the
plenipotentiaries of the several powers
were able to sign a final protocol with the
Chinese plenipotentiaries on tho 7th of last
September, setting forth the measures
taken by China in compllanco with tho de
mands of the Joint note nnd expressing
their Hutlsfuctlon therewith. It will be
laid before the congress, with a report ot
the plenipotentiary on behalf ot tho United
States, Mr. William Woodvllle Tlockhlll, to
whom high pral,e Is due' for tho tact, good
Judgment itud energy be has displayed In
performing an exceptionally difficult and
delicate task.
The agreement reached disposes In a
manner satisfactory to the powera of the
various grounds of complaint and will con
tribute materially to better future rela
tions between China and the powers.
Iteparatlon has been mado by China for the
murder of foreigners during tho uprising
and punishment has been Inflicted on the
ofllclals, however, high In ruuk, recognized
an responsible for or having participated
In the outbreak. Official examinations have
been forbidden for a period of live years In
nil clttes In which foreigner have boen
murdered or cnielly treated and cdietB have
been issued making alf officials directly re
sponsible for the future safety of foreigners
and for the suppression of violence against
them.
Provisions huve been made for Insuring
the futuro safety of the foreign represent
ntlves In Pekln by setting aside for their
exclusive uo a quarter of the city which
the powers can make defensible and In
which they can If necessary maintain
permanent military guards; by dismantling
the military works between the capital and
the sea, and by allowing the temporary
maintenance of foreign military posts along
this line. An edict has been Issued by the
emperor of Chlnu prohibiting for two years
tho Importation of arms and ammunition
Into China. China has agreed to pay ade
quate Indemnities to the states, societies
and Individuals for the losses sustained by
them and for the expenses ot the military
expeditions sent by the various powers to
piotect llfo and restore order.
Under the provisions of tbu Joint note of
December. 1900, China has agreed to revise
the treaties of commerce and navigation
4iul to take such other steps for the pur
pose ot facilitating foreign trade as the
foreign pqwers may decldo to bo needed
Ths Chinese government has areti tn
participate financially In the work of better
ing the water approaches to Shanghai and
to Tien Tslu, the centers of foreign trade
In central nnd northern China, nnd an
International conservancy board, in which
tho Chinese government Is largely repre
sented, has been provided for the Improve
ment of the Shanghai river and tho control
ot Its unvlgatlou. In Ihu same line of com
mercial advantages a revision of the present
tariff on Imports lias been assented to for
tho purpose of substituting specific for ad
valorem duties and an expert haa been sent
abroad on the part of the United States to
assist In this work. A list of articles to
remain free of duty, Including flour, ccrenls
and rice, gold and silver coin and bullion,
has also been agreed upon In the settle
ment. During these troubles our government has
unswervingly advocated moderation nnd has
materially aided in bringing about an ml'
Justment which tends to enhance the welfare
of China and to lead to n more beneficial i
Intercourse between the empire and the
modern world, whllo In tho critical perlol
of revolt nnd matsacre wo did our full
share In safeguaidlng life and property, re
storing order and vindicating tho national
Interest and honor. It behooves us to con
tinue In these paths, doing what lies In our
power to foster feelings of good will and
leaving no effort untried to work out tho
great policy of full and fair Intercourse be
tween China and tho nations,, on n footing
of equal rights and advantages to nil. Wo
advocate the "open door" with all that It
Implies; not merely the procurement of en
larged commercial opportunities on tho
coasts, but access to tho Interior by tho
waterways with which China haB been so
extraordinarily favored, Only by bringing
the people of China Into peaceful and
friendly community of trndo with all tho
peoples of tho earth can the work now
auspiciously begun be carried to fruition.
In tho attainment of thin purpose wo ncccs
sarlly claim parity of treatment, under tho
conventions, throughout tho omplro for our
trade and our citizens with thoe of all
other powers.

We view' with lively Interest and keen

My predecessor communicated to the con
gress the fact that tho Well and La Abra
awards against Mexico have been adjudged
by tho highest courts of our country to
have been obtained through fraud and per
jury on tbo part of tho claimants, nnd that
In accordance with the acta of tho congress
tho money remaining in tho hands of the
secretary of state on these awards has
been returned to Mexico. A considerable
portion of tho money received from Mexico
on these awards had been paid by this gov
ernment to tho claimants boforo tbo de
cision of tho courts was rendered. My
Judgment Is that the congress should re
turn to Mexico an amount equal to the
sums thus already paid to the claimants.

The death of Queen Victoria caused tho
people of tho United States deep and heart
felt sorrow, to which tho govcrnmont gave
full expression. When 1'iesldont McKlnley
died, our nation In turn received from every
quartor of tho Hrlllsh empire expressions
of grief and sympathy no less sincere. The
death of tho Empress Dowager Frederick of
Germany hIho aroused tho genuine sympa
thy of tho American pcoplo. and this sym
pathy was cordially reciprocated by Oer
roany when thu presidcut was assapsluatcd.
Indeed, from every quarter of tho civilized
world we received, nt the tlmo of the presi
dent's death, assurances of such grief and
regard as to touch the hearts of our people.
In the midst of our aflllntlon wo reverently
thank the Almighty that we aro at peace
with the nations of mankind, nnd wo firmly
Intend that our policy shall bo such on to
