HOW SENATOR ORVDEX STANDS.
It ?will be remembered that before
the election last month Senator Dry
den announced that he was a friend
of Roosevelt ami ho wanted to be re
elected to the United States senate
In order to help the president carry
, out his policies.
President Roosevelt has announced
his policies in his recent message. It
would be well for Senator Dryden to
tell the people of New Jersey how he
stands, now that there Is really some
thing to stand for.
Perhaps our good friend, James
Martin, who came over from the New
York Tribune to manage the Newark
Advertise, will address Senator Dry
den in a letter, on the questions in
volved. It will be remembered that
when Mr. Martin first took up his
duties with the Advertiser he wrote
to the insurance president asking him
If he stood by Roosevelt.
Senator Dryden replied most em
phatically that he did and recited In
stances to prove It. Thereupon Mr
Martin announced thnt he stood for j
Senator Dryden and the Newark Ad- j
vertiser has been the best backer i
Dryden has had.
Senator Drydon might bo naked If i
he would voto In favor of an Income |
and inheritance tax which the preai- j
dent recommends; whether or not
he favors federal incorporation laws;
amendments of the rate law; federal
control of marriages and dlvorco;
fedoral power to enforce treaties In
spite of powers now reserved for the
states; and many other policies rec
ommended In the president's mos
sag) and all of which will be passe 1
upon by congress during tho next e'x
years. Senator Drydon says he stands
by Roosevelt and wants to help hint.
Will tho senator tell tho people whe
ther or not he favors these things?
Cut tho people will have a chance
to know whether or not Senator Dry
den really intends to help Roosevelt.
A bill passed the house last year
limiting the hours of railroad em
ployment. When It reached the sen
ate, Senator La Follette endeavored
to have it made a part of the railroad
rata bill, but the railroad senators
fought It and by dodging, first one
way and then the other, they succeed
ed in having the bill laid over until j
the present session.
President Roosevelt. In his mee
mjw, favored an eight-hour tinv fo
ull railroad men and this menus thai
he insists thai this hilt shall bo pas vl

at once. It is on the calendar lo:
the senate to consider it January 51
and Senator La Follette can be de
pended upon to have it brought uj.
If Senator Dryden means what ho
says wneu he asks to be ro-e'ecu-i to
help Roosevelt, he will vote in favor
of this bill which is fathered by La
Follette. The people would like o
have Dryden's direct answer to the
important questions advanced la ti
president's message, but if he refuse?
to reply, his vote on the bill for sho
er hours for railroad employes w:
give some Indication as to how h
1 stands. The people of New Jerse:
await the outcome with interest.
I
TRUNK LINK TROLLEY.
An Interesting suggestion come
from Staten Island in connection wit'
the proposed new ferry between th;
city and Tottenvllie. In the last issr
| of the Staten Islander, published r
| St. George, S. I., was the followin
I editorial:
| "The scheme to run a new ferr
; line from Perth Amboy to Tottenvil!
land a trolley from the latter place t
(Richmond may be part of an enter
?(prising effort to have a grand trim
I line by trolley from Philadelphia t
I St. George. A prominent local rai
I road men seems to think so; in fac
i he has been thinking it out for a Ion
! time, although he has no connectio
whatever with the .scheme.
"A ferryboat might be butilt to cai
ry doable truck motor cars over th
Staten Island Sound by wager rout
and run them right on to iiichmon
to connect with the Midland trolle
line.
"This same thing has been thougl
out many a time, and now Is it con
ing? At any rate, the Rapid Trans
people are noting the importance c
the movement, and would shut, it ot
If they could. Last Friday night th
city council of Perth Amboy held
public hearing on the application c
the new company for a f<srry fra:
chise and Senator George A. Silzei
| who appeared at attorney fijr the ar
idicants, was vigorously cfjpo-ed b
[Judge Adrian Lyon, as counsel for th
Staten Island Rapid Transit Rallwa
Company. The latter promised a re
ductlon of fares to six tickets fo
twenty-flve cents, a new bofit to cos
$110,000, and other improvements, i
the new franchise asked for were re
fused, but not. otherwise.
"This may not bo, although it look
on the surface to be, the old story o
a monopoly being driven to Improve
meats by threatened competition. A
1 Ur eveft$' Ma>,0'r ? Ih[
?^council! would decide later. w
"None of our improvements has
come or can come without energetic
private enterprise, municipal action
or state or national authority, and
they are always, as Mr. Ernest Flagg
said at the Municipal Arts dinner,
brought about by public opinion and
agitation. We hope that good results
will come grom all the bridge und fer
ry schemes, by whomever initiated or j
carried out." i
To pay $15,500 for about thirty j
acres of swamp land at Runyon Is
decidedly more to the advantage of j
the Fountains, who own it, than to!
the purchaser. Therefore for the
water board to hire a high-priced law
yer to fight the people in a determi
nation to pay this sum is much lik"
using the people's money to pay
Fountains' lawyer, for a lawyer in
the employ of the Fountains could
no: put up a better fight against the
? city. The most aggravating par: o:
1 it all is that the city is already paying
a city attorney to attend to its legal
affairs and the special counsel now j
being paid by the water board wss'
never authorised.
YEW TRANSIT FOR RICHMOND.
Ferry Company Chartered and Trol
ley Company Is Organizing.
The borough of Richmond. whose
chief complaint has been poor tran
sit, is now definitely assured of addi- t
tionai ferry and railroad service. In
cidentally, the company which now}
has a monopoly of transit facilities
on the island is to meet with serious
competition. A new corporation has
been formed to operate a ferry ser
vice between TotteaTille and Perth
Amboy. and it is reported that a syn
dicate has taken the preliminary
steps to organise a company to build
ana operate a new trolley road be
tween Richmond and fntetsQle.
Articles of incorporation have been
Sled at New Brunswick. X. J., by the
Perth Am bey and States Island Ferry
Company, which will operate the
? ferry between Tcttenville and Perth
Amboy in opposition to the States
island Rapid Transit Pmiircad Com
pany. The capital stork is tllt-.&i'S.
and the stockholders are F. W O.
Schnitz. of Princes Bay, S. I . M F
Kief, Henry Lowenself, Edward
- White and John J. Nicholson, all oi
k New York; Emil Siesensach, of New
? ark, and J. W. Humphreys, of Ety
s onne. George S. Siixer. a lawyer of
1 Perth Amboy. with offices at New
"j ' stick, is named as agent for the
; I company. Mr. Silzer is not ready to
?;-e plats in ceiail, but he says,
? that the undertaking has been started
aua "in uts Cat tied tarough on a large j
scale. Negotiations are under way i
for water front property in Peyth ;
e Amboy. It is understood that the
o site referred to is near the foot of,
?- Fajette street. Three large paresis !
k of land at the <fooc of Main street,
0 Tottenville, were recently purchased
?_ by agents of those behind the ferry
company and the electric trolley
' company, Jointly.
" r reaertCK iirimn, vi <sc rar? ruw,
n and \V. J. Lally. a railroad contractor
of Manhattan, representing a syndi- i
cate, have taken preliminary steps
,-j toward organizing a company to op
,, erate a trolley line between Rich
d mond, Kreischerville, Roseville and j
Tottenville. This will open up for
? development some of the choicest ;
residential portions of Richmond
'? county. The length of the new svs- .
i 'em will be nine miles, and the com- j
it pany will be capitalized for $500,000. '
if , Application for a charter will be made
i -it once, and It is honed to have the
, | trolley in operation within a year. It
' , is possible that this new ferry and
railroad may have some affiliation i
' with the heavily constructed, fast :
'"I'rollc. line now being built across
r. j New Jersey.
i- The announcement is creating a !
v ' onsa'lon throughout the vicinity af-'
I fected, and particularly in Totten-J
, . ville, where the news has. fallen like !
a bomb among rapid transit interests. J
The situation is particularly interest-!
ing because of the movement for a '
municipal ferry from the Battery, to I
I i Tompkinsville, which received new -
? impetus recently as a result of the j
hearty support Controller Metz gave j
it. Commissioner J. A. Bensel, of the
. Department of Bocks and Ferries, is
in close accord with Mr. Metz, so that
'! Richmond Is apparently soon to have
J greatly Increased transportation facii- \
| , Ities.
The 1'lurk of the Wounded flanker.
Mr. Ciawson slouched slowly and 1
gainfully In the tracks of the runaway
j horse. With his eyes he followed the
I trail. With his brain he evolved var
I Ions means of escape. Behind hint
In the desert's hush ho could hear the
velvet footfalls of the ranger. Some
times for a hundred yards they would
come to him regularly, then stumb
llngly, haltingly. Once he thought
the man behind had fallen, but when
he had glanced over his shoulder he
I was on his feet lurching forward.
' "Keep your eyes ahead!" ho had
I snapped, and Clawson had obeyed.
After that a mile of thorny scrub
I dragged past them, and It. seemed to
I the man In front that his captor kept
I to his foot through the sheer force of
j i his Iron will. Then thp round, red
j sun leapt above the mesfcultc and the
: scorching border heal was upon theifl.
i PeT-splrailorf" ran In rivulets from
the band of Mr. Clawson"s heavy hat.
It got Into hWfeyes and Tjtlhded him.
It ran Into the corners of his burning
lips and tasted salty to l)ls dry
tongue. There were times ne almost
- forgot the man behind him?times
" when he forgot all else but the bllnd
1 Ing heat. Even his bruised foot bad
E ceased to pain him. At .first It had
I been awkward to walk with his hands
I' tied, but as they went he grew accus
I tomed to It. Truth to tell, Mr. Claw
I son was not used to walking at all.
H Lie preferred to ride, even If it were
(1. only to cross the street. Then, as the
? perspiration trickled tyywn his arms,
"i -V
the wet rawhide on his wrists grew
'loose. Now and again he furtivaly
strained his wriBts against each other
and Joyfully felt the thongs give as
if tbey were of rubber.
HOL'HEHOliDS HELPS.
Be sure to place a pad under the
oilcloth cover to your kitchen table,
as It lessens the noise, renders it eas
ier to clean and doubles Its wearing
Qualities.
It is possible to freshen stole cake
by steaming It for about an hour and
then leaving it in a hot oven for a
few minutes. Yesterday's rolls may
be made palatable by heating In the
oven until they become right hot.
When eaten warm they are delicious.
To increase the capacity of clothes
presses, cut sticks from old brooms
and place them across the clothes
press, letting the ends rest on the
boards that jiold the hooks. This en
ables many coat hangers to be used,
and If in a gentleman's clothes press,
trousers can be folded and placed
over the rods so that the creases will
remain in place.
If a grate be very rusty blacklead I
i: thoroughly and leave the wet black
lead to dry on it for a day or two
Then riean the grate in the usual I
way. It will polish beautifully, for
the black lead will have eaten off the
rust.
How often do you feel that there
are "too manv customers'* in your

That is one of the thirds advertising
