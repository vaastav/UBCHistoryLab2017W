The Message.
Following Is the text in full of i'resi

n the Senate und House of Repre
sentatives :
i sincerely regret that I cannot he

appily, I had the advantage of advice
the heads of the several executive
piirtmenis. who have kept in close
wli with affairs in their details.

Trade Balance Increased.
Our favorable balance of trade lias !

rope has been deprived of the means i
of meeting it heretofore existing, Ku

us nor could we eont-mphite lurgt
further imports of gold into this coun
try without concern.
Tile time has nearly passed for in
ternal government loans and it will
take time to develop in this country
a market for foreign securities. Any
thing, therefore, which would tend to
prevent foreign countries from settling
for our exports by shipments of goods
into this country could only have the
effect of preventing them from (laying
for our ex(xirts and therefore of (ire
venting the ex(Kirts from being made.
The productivity of the country, great
ly stimulated by the war, must find
an outlet by exports to foreign coun
tries. and any measures taken to pre
vent imports will inevitably curtail
exports, force curtailment of produc
tion, load the hanking machinery of
the country with credits ro carry un
sold products and produce industrial
stagnation and unemployment. If we
want to sell, we must he prepared to
buy. Whatever, therefore, may have
been our views during the period of
growtli of American business concern
ing tariff legislation, we must now
adjust our own economic life to a
changed condition growing out of the
fact that American business Is full
grown and that America is the greatest
capitalist in the world.

No policy of isolation will satisfy

straight- lacket, must yield and give

the nations concerned may lie success
fully and equitably adjusted.
There are other matters of impor
tance upon which I urged action at tlie
session of congress which are still
pressing for solution. I am sure it i
not necessary for me again to remind
you that there Is one immediate and
very practicable question resulting
from the war which "we -hnnht meet
in tlie most liberal spirit It Is a mat
ter of recognition and relief to our
soldiers. I can do not better than to
quote from my last message tills very
