Jap Problem
WHAT THE GOVERNOR RECOM
MENDED TO SECRETARY OF IN
TERIOR IN HIS REPORT.
Governor Carter made an Interesting
report upon the ono feature of the
Japaneso problem In these Islands, In
his annual report to tho Secretary of
the Interior. The report was sent to
Washington about two weeks ago and
has by this tlmo reached the Secretary.
In view of the existing conditions and
the recommendations of tho President
in his recent message to Congress re
lative to tho naturalization of Japan
ese and the rights of Japaneso children
to enter American scrools, the com
ments of the Governor are interesting.
The following is an excerpt of the re
port mado hy tho Govenor:
"There Is nothing to deplore in the
Increase of Japanese children. The
Japanese ore here probably In large
proportion to remain. Their natural
increase has been very great and, as
eight years have elapsed since annexa
tion, a largo number of the Japanese
children now crowding Into our schools
have been born under the American
flag. When these reach maturity they
will have the right of claiming Ameri
can citizenship. It is, therefore, most
Important that they should have full
opportunity of becoming equipped with
the knowledge and habits of thought
requisite to good American citizenship.
Apart from that consideration, It must
be conceded that it is the inalienable
privilege of every child under protec
tion of the flag to enjoy the benefits of
that public school system which is one
of tho chief glories of tho American
Commonwealth and which, moreover,
Hawaii took as an Ideal long before
admission and continues, as a part of
the Union, with best endeavors to
maintain."

"Whatever occurs in this regard
those Portuguese who have already
come in will In no way be affected.
They are here and will remain here as
long as they so desire, but the ue!isidn
of the Department of Justice may of
course affect future Immigrations.
"The Territorial law will certainly be
reviewed by the Department of Justice.
"It must be determined whether or
not any of these immigrants before
they started to come here had any un
derstanding with any Individual or cor
poration in regard to wages or employ
ment. According to the evidence I
have obtained there was nothing of
the kind, but it remains for the De
partment of Justice In its review of tho
Act to determine just what construc
tion is to bo put on some of the condi
tions under which tho immigrants
came here, not that there has been any
violation of the local law, for I believe
thee has not been but that the Act It
self must pass review.
"I shall make my official report upon
my arrival In Washington. I have ca
bled nothing In the way of an official
report. Of course I have cabled that
I will return In the S. S. Sonoma, but
ray official report awaits myarrlval at
Washington. I shall prepare my report
on the way up. This, together with all
the evidence taken here and a copy of
the Territorial Act will be reviewed by
the Department-of Justice."
