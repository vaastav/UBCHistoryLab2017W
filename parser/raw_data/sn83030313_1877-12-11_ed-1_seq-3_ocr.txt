Washington, Doc. 10, 1877.
TOT 8ILVHB QUESTION IN THE senate?de
isate on MB. Matthews' besulution.
Senator Matthews made hie maiden speech In the
Benato to-day on hia silver resolution, and made a
favorable Improsaion. He apoke boldly, and even the
Senators who did not agreo with bun listened. Gen
erally Senators do not listen to speeehea at all.
Toward the cloae of the discussion Senator Conkling
very neatly nut a spoke In the silver wheel
by giving notice that be would movo to change
the character of Mr. Matthews' roaolution. as
tt stands, and aa be Introduced It It la a concurrent
resolution, and which doas not need the signature ol
the President, and, If passed, would be be a mere ex
pression of opinion without lores ol any kind. Mr.
Conkl'ng proposed to make It e joint resolution
which oalls lor not only adoption by botn Houses, but
the elgnataro ol the Prestdont, and which, of coarse,
the President may voio. He explalnod that his ob:
Ject was to prevent a mere paper motion. He preferred
to bring up the question In a proper and
deolalve shape, so that It snould, as he remarked, test
not only the sense of tho Senate and of the other
House, which would doubtless approve It, but also of
the Executive, which wus presumed to have a voice
tn this as In other matters under the ooustttuiion. A
mere concurrent resolution effected nothing, A Joint
resolution would, It it should be passou and signed,
have the torce of law, and he had no doubt the friends
of the resolution would prefer It In that shapo.
But the friends of tho resolution evidently bad
serious objections. They were alarmed and annoyed
It Mr. Conkllng's blow, bat they could not evado It,
end to-morrow, accordingly, tho Senato will vote on
Mr. Conkllng's motion, and the strength or weakness
if the ultra silver men In the Senate will be known.
It will be literally a show ol bands, for the resolution
if Mr. Matthews plumply declares that all gov
iromeat bonds Issued under various acts up
to and Including that of 1875 are payable at the option
pf the government In gold or silver dollars, and that
to coin silver dollars or the old value and pay the
bonds with them is not a violation of the public faith.
Thla is a cardinal article Id the oreed of the extreme
silver man, and those have boasted lreqnently of lata
tbat they ere io a large majority in the Mounts. Mr.
Conkllng's motion will be a test of their strength, and
ho has very eflootively prevented their approaches by
sap and mine, and forced them to capture the Seuato
by storm if at alL
I When, last Thursday, Mr. Allison roported the
Silver Mil te the donate, and moved to make It ?
special order for Tuesday, Mr. Morrill moved to
amend by making It the special order for January 11,
nod this was defeated by 40 to 18. Mr. Allison's
motion was Asreupon carried, 41 to 18. 01 the
eighteen who were opposed to taking up the bill
until January eleven were republicans end seven
democrats, and Judge Oavls voted witb those who
wanted tho bill immediately considered, but this
vote, though U showed greater strength lor the
measure tnan was supposed to exist, was by no means
a tost, as some who wished for immediate considera
tion would not vote for It, evon with tne amontlmenia.
Senator Thurmnn to-day openly look his placo among
tho silver men, supporting the Matthews resolution,
but when ho said that gold had gone down sinco last
Thursday, when the Senate agreed to taxe up the Sil.
ver bill, Mr. Edmunds took him up rather sharply,
asking bun if be knew the price ol silver to day as
well as gold. Mr. lhuruan confessed that he did not,
and Mr. Edmunds retorted that Senators ought not to
come to the diBcurslon of so important a matter with
?o little knowledge.

THE SEATING OF MR. EUSflS? RELATIVE
STRENGTH OF PARTIES IN THE SENATE.
Tho sealing ol Mr. Eustis as Senator from Louisiana
completes the entire representation of States, and,
counting Judge Davis, of Illinois, as a democrat,

THE CONFERENCE OF THE CURRENCY INFLA

SEMINATED.
Tbe object of the conference of currency inflation
ists, held bere lust Saturday evening, has been mis
represented In most ol tbe accouuts given of the
meeting. The coutereuco was called by Sonator
Jones, who was tho only Senator present, although It
la understood that Senator Ferry Is >n full sym
pathy with Its object. The Congressmen present
Were Messrs. Swing, Holler, Duckner, Uartzell
and Phillips. Tbe rest of tbe assemblage was
made up chiefly of e number ol orators and essayists
In tho cause o( inflation wbo do not, as yet, onjor
Congressional honorx No new parly or independent
movement is contemplated. Tbe meeting discussed
the bost way to disseminate Inflation argument* in the
Eastern Stales where, aa all present eompitlnod, tbe
newspapers as a goneral thing overslaughed and sup
prosiod the views and opinions of the greenback and
Silver men. Tho Associated Press, too, was an ob
tiacio to the disaemlnutlon of inflation ideas. It
slurred over the speeches and pnblto utterances
of the edvoceles of greenbacks and silver. To
torroct all this, aud to enable and eneourage the dis
tribution Of Inflation theories It was decided to organ
ize a Congressional executive commines, with head
quarters In Washington, irotu which to send out to
tho public in pamphlet lorm or other advisable shape
nil decumonte and papers bearing upon tbe subject,
particularly tbe speeches delivered in Congress in favor
ol the sliver bill and tho bill to repeal tho Resumption
net, and tbe letter olMr. J. W. Sbuokers, of Philartel
pbia, la reply lo General Gardcld, recently published
In lb* Hxhald. This is all thsre is in
tbe way ol a movement. There is no In
tention to dsiturb present political organizations,
put lo make the question a distinct Issue Insido the
lines ot both parlies. A proposition was adopted to
make the committee consisi, as far as might be, of on*
Souuior and one Congressman from esoh State, but
whon tbls plan como to bo carried out It was found to

Wasuinoton, Deo. 10, 1877.
Mr. Waoi.eiuh, (rep.) o! N. II., cbarman ol the Com
mittee on i'rivilege* and Flections, called up, as a
matter ol privilege, th* resolution reported from thai
committee last work declaring J. B. JCustls entitled le
a seat a# Senator irom Ij>alsiaoa irem January 13,
1676, lor the term eneing March S, 1870.
TH! KISOBITT vtxw.
Mr. I so alms, (rep.) ol Kanraa, who signed tbe
minority roport, reviewed the etreumstences aiioud
Ing tho eleotlon of Mr. Euatia, and said tbere were
tUieo question* involved in this ante, bat two ol them
ooly sure raiorrcd to m tbo report ol tbe committee.
First, as to whether ne war lawfully elected; and
setond, whether at the lime ol his election a vacancy
existed which the Legislature ol Louisiana haa tho
right to nil. The third question, a* to whether th*
pipers or credentials belore tho Boost* constituted a
pr!m& facie caae, upon which be could be seated, era*
not referred to. The papers presented by Mr. Fastis
were merely wtt.it purported to be transcripts of toe
proceedings of tho Lecitlaiore, but mere was do
curtiilc ae of ttie Governor as to bis election, sod it
did not appear I bat tbe Governor had been asked
to give suctt certiflcuie aud declined to do so.
In inu next place it did not uppoar tttat auy quorum
ot tbn two bouses of tbe Legislature was present
ivPen the eleeiiuu was held, and that was a tatal omis
sion ; besides, tbe pamphlet claiming to be a record si
; the proceedings ot tbe Legislature was awt aaftbentl
' cuted. He then quoted si length from mob paoinhkot,
aud uiado su extended argument upon Ills legal as
pects ol tbe esse claiming iuo Senate should eetU*
now and for all tune tbe queattou ol propar crass
Hals, See. do isr as tbo admission ol Mr. Basils was
cuucerued there was no uecesaiiy whatever for say
partisan view of tbe case. The Legislature Ol Lmiisi
nna is now democratic, and it would bs In session lu
January, 1878; therefor#, eboeld tbe Senate uold mat
Mr. Kustii bad not s sufficient tttia to tbe seat tba
| Legislature would return bitn or some other democrat
to ibe Senate. Ho then quoted irom tbe set of July
115, 1800, prescribing tbe manner ol oonduoilag tbo
election lor -enators, aud said now was the proper
tune lor tbe Sonute to giro a proper construction to
that act. That statute was one ol tbe bad results ol
ihe war. It arose irotn ibe turbulence, the disquiet
produced by the war, and was one of its worst re
sults. In conclusion, Mr. Ingalls argued tbst there
was no vacancy In tbe Senate at tbo lime Mr. Kuttls
was elected; that tbe case ol Mr. 1'iiiobbtcK was then
ponding before tbe Sonata, and was not settled until
tbreo months subsequent to the election of Mr.
Rustle.
Mr. Wahlbioh, of Xew Hampshire, said bis friead
(Mr. IngalU) objected, io ilia admission of Mr. Basils
because bo bad not tbe certificate oi tbe Governor as
to bis tiiecnou. U appeared in the evtdeuca before
toe Committee on Privileges sod Rlectluns tlist be did
apply to tbe Governor lor his certificate, and tbe Gov
ernor replied be did not know how be could give it,
baviug already given one to Mr. Pinchbaolc. The ab
sence of this corlificute did not affect tbe title ol tbo
olaimunt. He then referred to tbe pamphlet setting
lorili the proceedings ol toe Legislature, .imt said no
oue ever doubted ita authenticity. Tho committee re
garded it as the true record ol ibe proceedings, and it
showed that Mr. Eustt* was duly elected. No charges
were made against Mr. Euntia ol any Improper con
duct to secure his election, and it was admitted by all
partlos that be was a proper person to fill iuo seat, do
lar us the question of a vucauuy si the lime ol bis
election wus concerned tbe c?mmiiieo was not en
tirely tree from doubt, but nobody contested the right
of Mr. Kustia io bis seat now, and the State oi Louisi
ana was entitled to ber twe Senators upon this Moor,
lb couclus:ou, be spoke ol the duty ol tba Hen a to to
admit me claimant und thus have tbe state ol Louisi
ana, so loug without representation, now fully repre

MIL MATTHEWS' SILVER KH.VOLLTION.
Mr. Matthews, of Onto, then called up fToin the
tabic tho coucurrent resolution submitted by him ou
Thursday last, declaring tho right ol tho govornmotit
to pay tbo principal and Interest ol tbo bouds in stiver
dollars containing 412>i grams ot standard
silver. Mr. Matthews said the General Assem
bly of tbe State ol Obio at Its session lust winter
adopted a resolution tavorlog the restoration ol tbe
silver dollar. Tbe lesoluilou was passed with great
unanimity, there being but three negative votes in the
House ol Kepreeeutativve and one in the Senate, and
be bud no doubt that it expressed the considerate and
deliberate opinion ol the people oi that Stale on tho
subject with tho same uoauitnity ovmoed by their
representatives in the passage ot tbo resolution. He
bad been moved in part by that resolution to submit
tbo one now belore tbe Senate, though his resolution did
not cover tho wbole ground. l hat oil no Ohio Assembly
expressed tbe opinion that saeb restoration of tho
silver dollar was ueaiaaded by true financial wisdom,
ana declared It would be in pursuance ol a proper
public pelicy to do so. It was not now bis purpose to
discuss the latter propemtten m to what would bq ex
pedient and politic lor tne government aud the poeple
> to do, but what would be right to do. In his opinion
It would bo right tor the government to do so, and he
used the word "right" in Its legal, equitable and moral
sense, it was his purposo to-uny briefly io show that
by the letter and spirit ol tho law tbe govarumsnt had
iuo right to restore tbo silver dollar and would bo
jusiiticd in doing so, and lurtbor to show tbut outside
of the law, takiuc in view nil tbe circumstances ol ibe
case, ovory incident of the financial legislation, that
the restoration of the dollar would not he in violation
ol tho declaration ol public honor, public Justice or
public oqutty.
TDK WORD "COIN."'
He then quoted Irom the act to eirongthon tbe pub
lic credit, approved March 18, 180U, and argued ihat
the word "coin," as used in ibis aot, must not be inter
preted to reier to geld lu cotu aione. II It must be so
interpreted, then it would be Just as dishonorable, Just
as illegal, to ply tbe liuited Males Treasury notes now
circulating as money In anytbing else but gold ooln as
it would bo topiy the bonds with anytbing but such
coin. There wcro Senators here who were lamillar
with circumstances attending the passage of this law
and the history ol legislation aulecodcnt to tin pas
sage. The question that it was deslcned to solve was
not a doubtful one. Tbo greenbacks bad bcun
made a legal tender for all debts and demands, public
and privmo, except interest on tne public uobt and
lor customs duties. The question had. ihcrelore,
boon ugituted as to whether tbo principal ol
the debt mt(bt not lawfully be paid lb greenbacks,
and to meet lae question, lo answer It lb the nega
tive, tbe Public Credit act of 1800 was passed. In bis
opinion tho original indebtedness ot the country
could never have ueen liquidated uuder any other cur
rency than coin dollars. It could not liavo been set
tled wilb mere promises to pay, in lieu of com dul.
lars. That act woa intended to'settie any question of
poy ing tbe principal of these bonds, sod it did seem
to blm that it it had been contemplated that these
bonds should be paid only with gold money It would
bavo been so stated; that lu undertaking to settle a
doubt this siiituta would not have raised anew one.
The act of I860 declared me goverumeut would pay
colu dollars. And what did coin moan at that
day ? Nothing was coin la this country ex
cept that wnieli by law might be coasted
as money, and there was on the statute
books at that tuna another law which proscribed now
many grams ol gold there should do in gold coin and
how many grsins of silvor in silver coin, una Irotn the
Iteginning ol tbe government down to that time tbo
silver dollar was known to tho people ol tbe country
as one ol our coins.
He next quoted irotn the set of 1862, tbe fifth sec
tion ol wbicb provided in.v. all duties on imports
should bo nayablo in coin, and com so received should
bo set apart an a special fund lor certain purposes, Ace.,
und argued that up to tbo act ot 1873, winch dropped
the silver dollar from the coin ol ibeUnilod Slates,
silver dollars were receivable lor customs duties and
were pledged ler tbo payment ol interest on tho public
debt.
Tn* act of 1870.
He next quoted Irom too act of July 14, 1870, to au
thorize iho refunding ot tbe naiiouai debt, ana said it
was intended to ue a now startiug point id tbe history
of tho public debt. It was intended to define with tbe
utmost precision the medium lar tho redemption ot
Ibeee bonds Tbe measure ol tho value ol those bonds
wut most explicitly declared. They were doclarea to
bo redeemuule "in coin of tne present standard
value" and bounng Interest, payable aemi-annuuliy,
in such coin. Thera was do ambiguity about those
terms there wus no doubt about wbat more words
meant. the act was ae free from any possi
ble siiado ol doubt as words could make
It. It referred io tho standard com iboa
in existence ana no matter how much such coin might
be depreciated or dooased. appreciated or Increased
In value by tbe exerclee ol me sovereign power of iho
government, still (hat ahoald not alleci tbe rights of
ihe holders ol theae bonds wbou tbey matured, but
the governmeat would deliver to ibem so mauy pieces
of gold or so many piece* el silver at were known lo
ibejaw when the bonds were issued. He arguod thai
all the bonds, by their terras, by tho plain and proper
menningof iho words on tlioin, were redeemable in
the coins known 4o ilia statutes ol tbe Untlod Slates
at the time such bonds were authorised.
TflK BPECIK RXSCMITION ACT.
He tbon referred t? the apecio Hcsumptloo act of
1875, and staled thai prior lo the passage of that act,
hut subsequent lo tne act of 187U, to wit, by the art ot
1073, a new coinage was established winch dropped
Irom tbe list ol authorized coins of tho United States
wliai hud always been known lo our law as tbe silver
dollar Now, lu law or lu morals, what difference did
that maker Thu United States, as one ol tne parties
to s contract, could not of its own motion change tbe
cootiact, tlierelore tbst act did not affect tbe holders
ol tbo bonds Tbe rorititls contained in nts pre
amble aud resolution logically end legally Justified
the conclusion that It was necessary lor tho
govcrnmout to roiraco us steps and restore
the luw as it waa prior to 1873, put back
the silver dollar as It stood, a legal lender Tor the
payment of ail bonds, snd to do to woo Id not be in
violation ol the public laith nor in derogation or tbe
rights ol tbo public creditor. Tbe governmoet. In

.trEKCII Or MK. MOHK1L1..
Mr Mottnu.t., (rep.) ol' Vl. sain tl tbe Senator from
Ohio bad iiiirouucud this resolution and asitod lis
rolorenoo to the Committee on toe Judiciary bo
might have tin icrstood his purpose. The question
raised by his resolution was a legal one, and wnenever
the main question came up as to the remonelizalion
of silver ho (Mr, Morrill) would bo prepured to ex
press his views upon it, and ho hoped to he nble 10
show lhat II would be cheaper and beltor (or tho
United btntos to pay Its debts lu gold. The
Senator Irom Obio (Mr. Matthews) had set
out with tho declaration tbai wo bad ibo
equitable and legal right to par our bond! In
siivor. It roust be Known to tbat Senator that for
forty yoors the country had not ooined silver dollars
except for exportation, aud only a small amount for
that purpose. During all tbia time tho govern
I had been
tneut liad been lu receipt ol gold Irom customs duties,
every doliur of which wua pledged lor tho payment ol
iho pttollo dent. Could It ha possible now ibat Con
gress could say a debt so contracted could be paid in
anytblng but gold? Ho quoted from tho act
of February 26, 1842, to establish tho sinking
fund, Ike., ami said If ihat should bo
carried out tho whole debt of the government would
be paid In a very short time. It did aoem to him tbat
tho pabhc lattb had been pledged to pay the boods In
gold coin. Uur Secretaries ol tho Treasury had gtvou
?ttch pledges, and their acts bave never been repudi
ated by Congresa He quoted Irom seotlon 4 of the
tourteeuln amemlmenl to tbe Constitution of tbe
United Slates in regard to the validity of tbe pablto
dobt, and astd that amendment waa adopted
to prevent tbuso from tbe .Southern Slates
questioning Its validity and not to light the
heresies of Ohio. Now, in this time of
reoonelltation, when the Southern representatives had
been rebapuzo.l in patriotism, tie appealed to ibetn
to reject the proposition ol tbe Senator from Oblo.
There were various other points ol that Senator's
i-pcnoh to which he would like to reler bad be tbe
time to do so, hut ono point in puriicular he could
uot pass. Thu Senator (Mr. Mstlbows) spoke of
locking up money iu order to gam ihoreoy. Did he
not kuow that there had uever been a time
in the history ol tbe government wbon money
could be obtained more readily or at leas
Interest. He moved tho reference ol tb? resolu
tion iu tbo Committee on the Judiciary.
Mr. CoKKi-isr, said he wished to submit an amend
ment beluro its reference, and that was to strike out
tbo word", "lie it roeoived by the Seuato (tbe Houeo
of lUprcseutailvea concurring therein)," and insert in
lieu thereof the words, "Resolved by tbo Senalo aud
House ol Representatives. " He said his purposo was
to uiakn It a Joint resolution instead of a coucnrrent
resolution, so ibat. It It were udopted, It would go to
tbe President for bla signature. Ibo natloual Execu
tive bad deposited with him oue-sixth ol tba legisla
tive power, and In a case of aach Importance as tbla
be tnougbt there should be an expression of tne lull
legislators power.
Mr. Tpphuax, (dem.) of Ohio, arguod tbat It waa
perfectly competent for either braneb ef Congress to
declare its opinion as to what was the law of lbs land,
uod It was perloctly competent for tbe two houses of
Congress to do so by a concurrent resolution, and If
Congress entertained an opinion as to an existing state
ol tne law that opinion should not be nullillcd by u
veto of Ibo President. Ho wanted everybody to un
derstand the opinion of Congress and then tbe l'rcsluent
mighiuci as be saw Dt bonrsfter; but he did not nsk
tbe I'residont lor bis opinion now. Tbe resolution
submitted by bis colleague (Mr. Msttbews)
raised a simple question of law. Tnoro was no ne
cessity for referring It to a commuter. There was
nothing upon tbe subject bat ono or two statutes, and
no report any oumniiuce could m.ike would lossf-n the
debate In the Meoutn one boar. He was marvellously
curious to kuow by what reason any lawyor could ar
rive at any other conclusion tbau that expressed in
tbe resolution of lite colleague.
Mr. Edmund* said the question with blrn at tbe proa
oni mom jdi was. What would be the effect of tne pass
age of this resolution upon the public credit ? It pro
posed to deelare tne opinion oi the two nouses ol Con
gress not as a law, and what effect would tbat hare
upon the actual condition of things ? Was It not more
candid. It Congress was to say anything affecting ibo
publlo credit, that It should bo done by law
la a manner that would he binding boreafter?
Such a resolution as ibis would do nothing effective.
It would not Injure tho rich bondholder. Tbe bloated
bondholder was geuerally able to take care ol himself,
but it would ll()uro the widow, the orphan, tne labor
ing classes who had Invested tho money In govern
ment bonds and enable speculators and gamblers to
gamble on the public credit. He favored tbe amend
mvnlol the Senator from New York.
Mr. Tuubmaii raid be bad been ulee years In
tbe Senate, and If tbero had been any flnoo
oial legislation for tbe bonefli of the widow and or
phan or laboring classes be had failed to see It. Tbn
.Senator from Vermont warned the Senate tbat tots
resolution would endanger the pubil credit. Sinco tho
.Senator spoke be (Mr. Thurmau) bud opened bis Now
York paper.
Mr. Knsixns?What is tbe name of the paper?'
Mr. 1 tin km as?It is the New York Wvrld, which I
know tbe Senator from Vermont rends daily with In
tense uuniirntion. (Laughter.) Continuing his re
mark* he said the (Senate last week made the Silver
hnl the special order for to-morrow, and he saw when
he opened his paper Ihm gold was one-MXieenlli
lower lor Uie week. He turned then to government
stocks and be lound that every houd ol the United
Mates had risen in value since mat bill was made tbo
special order.
Mr. Mokbim.?How much has silver fnllan since tbo
Blari'l bill passed?
Mr. TituawAM replied?You bsvs demonetized silver.
It la nut quoted. The Senator assumed fust gold was
au immeasurable standard Of valvo with which every
thing else mast be eomparod. Tbero never had been
In bis humble Judgment, ol all the humbugs ba ever
knew of, more of a lurobug than aboat this tfilver
bill.
Mr. Edmunds?I think so too, (Laughter.)
Mr. I n t'KM a it, continuing, said there waa one class
of people who thought if the bill rhould pass all they
would havo to do would bo to bold up their bats aud
silver dollars would rain into them; end there was
another class who thought ibo public credii would be
rained by It. Thorn was no reason for any such sup
position. Any such Idea was Inllncioos. he emn
mouied on the report of the dooretary of tbe Treas
ury In regard to tbe remonetization of silver,
and arguod that It would not be ?n
injury to the government bat a groat boneflt to Ibe
whole people. .Should tho Silver mil be passed to-day
every dollar of tne publio indebtedness could bo
funded at lour per cent.
Pending discussion tbe Sonata, at Ova o'clock, ad
journed by a vote of?yeas SO, nays 2fl?not ? test
vote, as many Senators known to b* in lavor of tbn
resolution voted for an adjournment ou account of the
lateness of tho hour.

Induced me to csamiue with some care lha Message
ol the President, winch wee transmitted to line House
on the litlh ol November, and wbicu was referred to
the Commiiioe oh Foreign Allaire. The perusal of the
documents accompanying that Message will convince
tbe House that our reUuont witn Mexico are in a
very critical condition. Already aoveral dciaciimoots
of troops, acting uuuer tbe orders ol Ibo 1'resnJeut,
transmitted lo General Ord, have invaded the Mexican
territory against the protest ui the de lacto govern
ment ol that oouuiry, which, although it has been In
power longer than the proscnt admitilstranou, has
not yet been formally recognizod by our government.
AM KMC A \ TROOPS OS UkXlCAX SOU.
At this present uiomcut a ueiacnmeui ol American
troops is upon the Mexican soil, but wticre no oue
kuows, and it it should turn out that it has been cap
tured, or ttiul a conflict bad taken place belaeou it
and Iho Mexican troope, whereby blood baa been sued,
It must be acknowledged thai tuo danger ot war will be
very imminent, if no, unavo dabie. M e onnnot abut
our eyes to these dangers. Tim country dooe not want
war. It desires a unit) ol rest to recover Irom tbe
lossea of war. It desires an opportunity lo sireugtlieu
Itaoil iu order lo meet the obligations which it hat
Incurred during a long and destructive struggle. A
new war will add to these obligations and
make the burden ol debt and the preseuru of taxation
Intolerable. What loecoumry desires u lo make iheui
lees, and there is no method ul reducing iheso buraeua
so efleciually as lo enlarge our trade witn ueighboriug
countries. Mexico oilers a uioai inviting Held, an well
as the nearest avenue ol such extenaiou ol trade. Our
people desire to cuiuvuie peacelul relations with a
customer so near and so vuluable, aud all will agree
that iho esiablishmeut ol beiler commercial relation*
will be the surest guursuioe ol peace. 11 a system of

Mr. Hai.ir, (rep.; ol Me.?I nope the amettltnoul
offered ov the gentleman from New York (Mr. Uowltt)
will he adopted. It is Iu the right direction. 1 have
always, lor years pan, hud uneasiness about turn
question of the Mexican border, aud about the daugor
ol thisouuutry heiog embroiled In a needless quarrel
wilU Mexico. The loue ol the amendment, I uin glad
to n*y, instead ot being In tny degree inflammatory,
is paciflcatery. To my mind all reasons lie in tavor
of a peaceful policy thoro. By Urtunosa wo can as
sert and maintain our rights. But 1 agree iully in
what tbe genileiiiuu from New York (Mr. Hewitt)
saye, that tno country does not want war on auy
issae that has beon raised or that la likely to bo
raised. Aud so 1 hope the uniondmont will bo adopiod.
Mr. Keaoa.v, (dent.) of Texas, agreed ihat it was not
well to make war. and that it was the duty of the gov
ernment, ti the way wus open, to resort lo peacelul
modes aud to improve the cotnmereittl and Iriendly
relations ot ihe United Slates and Mexico, rather than
to resort to auy plau looking to war. He Intimated,
however, that tlie existence ol what Is known as the
"Free Xeuc" in Mexico was an obstuclo to commer

Mr. Cox, (den.) ol M. Y., a member of the Commit
tee on Foreign AlTairs, stated that that committee had
had under consideration the question of aOolrs on the
Kio Grande, and had heard the statement el General
Ord. Whether or not there was u cloud of war bang
ing over the Klo Grande was a problem wbiob tbo
newspapers were discussing with some littlo a priori
resemblance lo probability. The condition ol tmngs
there oalled lor some such action as was lieru pro
posed. Bui what could congress do? The keeping
ol peaco with Mexico depoudod mostly uu diplo
macy?clepeudod altogether, he wss going to suy. ou
the Kxccutlve. Gougress con id do Very Utile except
to give what moral power it could give oy resolution,
and It ihereloro became a serioes quesliou how tar
Congress and its committees should go in attempting
to allorltrto tbo troubles on tbe Kio Urando. Mexico
was our noighbor, "our sick man." Mex>oo was vol
caum, politically and pbysloslly. For the last blly
seveu years ol tier Indepuudcnce she bad been iu n
mate ol ehronic revolution. It had been the policy
of iho American government whenever it saw a de
/acta goveruoieut to recognise it, and he wan, there
fore, utterly at a less to know wbv tbe government of
President Bin had not been recoguised. President
Diss bad the capital,' the archive*, tbe army, all tb*
lusigniaand paraphernalia of power. His government
was an much dt/aelo an some other* which be could
name; (laughter;) an nucb dr /acteaa that ot tb*
Confederate .States whoa they bad to be recognised
uuder some pressure or necessity. American troops
crossed the river at almost any point, and If troop* of
tbo two countries met there wan no lelilug what a cay
or an hour might bring forth. To-dsy what was like a
little npeok no larger then a niau'a hand might to
morrow become an imminent thunder cloud.
It therefore behooved Congress, ae tno conser
vator of peace, to niRiraat diplomacy id tbe matter
and to atop anv attempt to pluage the oouuiry into
war. He Ihereloro lavnrod the amendment offered by
his colleague (Mr. Hewitt), because it might enlarge
the scope ol Inquiry started by the Cointnliteo on For
eign Affairs, aud that committee would, unaer the
load ol lis distinguished chairman (Mr. Swann, of Mary

Mr. Wbitr, (rep.) of Pa., a member of tbe Committee
on Military Aflairs, reminded the llouso that that com

Columbia, S. C., Dec. 10, 1877.
Tbe Supreme Court room in tnis cay to-day pre.
sen ted a spectacle of peculiar and painful Interest,
?it little children of both sexes being present nnder a
charge of murder. The oldest of tness children hog
not yet reached the sge of sloven years, end
two ol tho number are girls Their names era
Harmon Fallow, Henry Fallow, Robert Fallow,
Mury Fallow, Ansa Fallow and William Kills The
Avenret named are the children ot the same parents^
respectable people of KdgeAeld eoanty?snd
tho last named Is an adopted child In
tne same family. The circumstances of the
killing which earned their appearance in tbo court
to-day were in brief as follows:?The children wore
at work picking cotton In a Held near their minor's
bouse abont ? week ego, whoa a negro yooih named
Willis Asbill, about eighteen years of age. who had
been discharged Irom Mr. Fallow's service and ordered
is keep off the premises, joined tbom and commenced
ill treating ihem aod ntterlering with tbeir work In
virlous ways Finally be went so lar as to strike
one ol tbe boys with e stick. The resontmeut of toe
little lalmrcrs culminated at this affront and they at
ottos made a combined attack upon ibeir tormentor
with atones, sticks ?nd Knives, which they employed
with such effect as 10 loOiet a severs injary upon the
bead ol Asbill, which, as I* alleged, brought njivn htm
an attack ol ccrebro spinal meningitis, roau'Ung in
death a day or two ago.
nnoroHT to oousr.
Tbe children were at once arrested on s charge of
morder and brought to Colombia, wnsre thoir '?-it
came up to day, as above etatod, iu tin Supreme
Court, en application for a writ of habeas
oorpn*. After s touching argument by counsel
ably seconded. It may well be believed, by tbe
almost infantile appearance of the affrighted prisoner*,
the Court granted the writ, sad bail was allowed Is
the snm of (3,000 lor the appearance ot the defendants
at the next terra ol tbe Conrt of General .Sessions for
Edgefield co&nty. The case has excited the keenest
Interest in this community and is without parallel ir
