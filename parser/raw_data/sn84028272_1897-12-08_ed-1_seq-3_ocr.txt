HAITI MUST PAY.
German Cruisers Bring art Ulti
matum to the Islanders.
A Demand Is Mads for Payment of In
4emnlty to Ben Lueders for HI
Arrest and Imprisonment
Great Excitement at
Fort au Prince.
, Port au Prince, Haiti, Doc. 7. The
trouble between Germany and Haiti,
as a result of the arrest and imprison
ment of Herr Lueders, a German sub
ject, reached a crisis yesterday. Two
German cruisers entered this port and
an ultimatum from the German rot
eminent was delivered to the Haitien
government, giving the latter eight
hours in which to grant the demands
of Germany for an indemnity to Herr
Lueders. The members of the diplo
matic corps here believe the govern
ment of the republic has decided to ac
cept the conditions of Germany.
In anticipation of trouble, the citi
zens of German nationality on Sunday
sought refuge on board two steamers
which were at this port and the French
steamer Ville Da Marseille has been
requisitioned by the French minister
in order to serve as a place of refuge
for French citizens. The population of
of this place is greatly excited, but the
government has a strong force of
troops at its disposal and is resolved to
maintain order.
Berlin, Dec. 7. In the relchstag
Monday Baron von Bulow, the minis'
ter for foreign affairs, said, referring
to Haiti: "We are not satisfied with
the mere release of Herr Lueders and
have demanded satisfaction and com'
pensation for his illegal incarceration,
which was contrary to Haitien and in-
ternational laws. We hope the gov
ernmcnt of Haiti will accept our de
mands, as, in addition to the justice of
our claim, we have the will and the
power to enforce it"

Congress Resumes Business at the Old
Stand In:llut of the First Day's Ses
sion. Washington, Dec. 7. At noon Mon
day the first regular session of the
Fifty-fifth congress betran. Simul
taneously at both ends of the Capitol,
Speaker Reed in the house and Vice
President Uobart in the senate, dropped
their gavels and called to order the
respective bodies over which they pre
side.
The attendance upon the session of
the senate, both on the floor and in the
galleries, was large, despite the well
understood fact that little business be
yond the presentation of the presi
dent's message and the proceedings in
cident thereto would be transacted. A
number of beautiful floral pieces were
presented to various senators. Prior
to the convening of the senate, the
members passed a hall hour in ex
changing greetings.
When the senate convened after the
recess Hon. H. D. Money, the new sen
. ator from Mississippi, entered the
chamber, but the oath of office was not
administered to him during the ses
sion. The reception and reading of
the president's message was the only
feature of the day. Close attention
was paid to the reading of the mes
sage, especially that portion relating
to Cuba.
House. The opening day of the reg
ular session in the house passed with-
out any unusual incident The for
malities attending the Inauguration of
the session were dry and hardly repaid
the crowd which thronged the galler
ies. Yet with few exceptions the vis
itors sat through the whole proceed
ings. Many members were the recipi
ents of beautiful floral offerings. Mr.
Dingley, the floor leader of the major
ity; Mr. Bailey, the leader of the mi
nority, and Mr. Grosvenor, of Ohio, en
joyed the honor of being appointed
to wait upon the president, whose
message Vas the event of the day. Its
reading was followed with close atten
tion by the members and spectators in
the galleries. There was no demon
stration until the reading was con
eluded, when the republicans joined in
a hearty expression of approval. Im
mediately after the reading 'of the
. messnge the house adjourned out of
respect to the memories of Senator
George, of Mississippi, and Represent
ative Wright, of Massachusetts, who
had died during the recess.
A SHARP REPRIMAND.
Fall Text of the Rebuke Administered by
the Secretary of war to Capt. Covering,
Washington, Dec. 7. Secretary Alger
yesterday made public the reprimand
administered to Capt. Covering by sen
tence of court-martial, as follows:
By order of the president, the proceedings,
findings and sentence In the case of Capt. Lot
i-ring. Fourth infantry, are approved. It Is.
however, disappointing that an offense so grave
and an example so far reaching as this should
have been visited with so light a penalty.
There Is no question but that Private Ham
mond deserved punishment for his conduct,
but he should have received It in a lawful way.
The military laws governing the army are ex
plicit. They prescribe the duties of officers
and enlisted men, with the penalties for their
violation. Under them, both have rights and
obligations.
When, therefore, an officer with the intelli
gence and experience with which Capt. Cover
ing Is oredltei, not only violates these laws, but
exhibits such a lack or humanity as la shown
in this case, he should receive a more severe
sentenoe than a mere repiimand. Committing
auch ants degrades the officer more than the
soldier he punishes and shows unfitness for the
oare and command of men. Under excitemeut
men frequently do things which In cooler mo
ments they recall with sorrow and regret, but
this case Is aggravated by the fact that after
weeks of deliberation this officer evinces no re
gret for his wrongful acta.
