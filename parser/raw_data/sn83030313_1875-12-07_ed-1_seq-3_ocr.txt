SPEAKER KI/KU PREPARING THE COMMITTEES
FOR THE NEW HOU8J5.
Speaker Kerr Is bogy this evening considering his
appointments for tho commitces or the new House.
The excitement and fatigue of the opening session to
day told heavily on him. Early in tho afternoon he
Showed signs of great weariness, and by four o'clock
there was a perceptible tremor in his voice and he was
quite hoarso. A large number of friends and business
callers visited him this evening, aud be kindly gave
them audience, when really ho was scarcoly able to re
ceive bis intimate friends. His wife is with him and
she is of much help in entertaining tho callers, who
otherwise would occupy all of her husband's timo.
DISGUST OF TI1E DEMOCRATS OVER THE DE
BATE ON TUE LOUISIANA MATTER?CRITI
CISMS ON SPEAKER KERR?THE REPUBLICANS
ELATED.
The democrats are In a stato of disgust to-night over
the contest In the House to day over the Louisiana
member. It now appears that the movement of Mr.
Wood was prearranged aud had tho consent of Mr.
Kerr. It was in fact a party programme, but, unluckily,
the members, many or whom aro new, have not
come together yet in such a shape as to be
under strict discipline. Notice was not given to them,
but it appears to have been supposed that they would
follow their leaders, as, indeed, the larger part of them
did until the leaders were beaten. Meantime complaint
Is made by many of the members, some of them
leading men, that in the middle of the con
test the Speaker hacked out and caused it to
be understood (hat ho now thought tho movement
111 advised and thereupou thero was a oraak in the
ranks and those who had committed themselves
on the lloor felt themselves abandoned under fire. The
Speaker pleads in excuse that he was too busily en
gaged in other matters yesterday to give the Louisiana
question thorough consideration, aud that he took the
word at that time of other people. Hut to (his those of
Ins party who criticise him say that first he ought to
Have been familiar with the Louisiana ques
tion and its bearings upon tho case of Mr.
Morey, and second, that when he changcd his
mind he should have first sent word to Messrs.
Wood and Lamar, so that they should not feel them
selves suddenly loft in the lurch. Tho republicans on
their part aro correspondingly elated. They claim that
they have scored the first victory, and that their op
ponents stand before the country not only beaten but
detected in a very Hourbonlsh attempt to revive, In an
indirect manner, a question which was fairly aud fully
settled last April.

Washington, Dec. 6,1875.
SCENES IN TIIE OPENING SESSION OI' THE
FORTT-FOURTH CONGRESS?AN IMMENSE CROWD
XN ATTENDANCE.
Not. since the exciting days of tho rebellion and the
flush times of the original inflation of the currency,
? ben the former furnished the attraction and tho latter
the means of a visit to the national capital, has Wash
ington sent np the steep slopes of Capitol Hill so dense
u crowd as poured this morning Into the building to geo
the opening ol Congress. For over an hour in advance
of the timo fixed bylaw for tho opening of tho two
houses the crowd had been coming. Tho multitude
made (heir way to tho building by the western, north
irn and southern approaches, but (he aristocracy stepped
out of carriages at tho eastern portico, the arrival
md departure of the hundreds or stylish equipages and
ihe banging and slamming of carriage doors recalling
k Nilsson night at your Academy of Music in Fourteenth
itreet. A lew of tho incomers loitered ut tho Scnato
thamber, or over tho paintings on tho stairways but
)he crowd pushed on in an unbroken stream to the gal
lories of tho House, the half dozen tiers of which wero
rapidly packed to their very uttermost seating capa
rlty, tho four sides making a quadrangle of compart
humanity. Over, above, in tho doorways and aisles
Uie people were hanging in dark clusters, threatening
lo come down by the run to the floor of
the chamber. Opera glasses were In constant
nse and were levelled in all directions
about the House. The people In the galleries couldn't
lee or recognize much of each other owing to the ar
rangement of tho light, which put thetn up aloft In a
tort of haze, but poured in concentrated strength upon
the body vt the House.
Tho intorval to noon was a noisy hubbub of voices
'rom every portion or the House. The crush In the
(allories had a counterpart In the Intrusion of hundreds
pl interlopers on tho floor. The members wero forced
put of their seats, and the doorkeepers had to supply
;hairs from tho committee rooms. A couple of hun
dred pretended newspaper attaches of both sexes in
vaded the reporters' gallery aud occupied their seats.
The Hkrald desk was captured earijr In tho day
?>y a redoubtable miss, who only betrayed the
stratagem she had used to get a place of observation
?hen, in jotting down her make-bellevo notes, she
Milled Mr. Blaine's name with a little "b." The
liplomatio gallery was the only reservation not
positively crowded, but ltd seats were all occupied.
The British legation was represented by Hon. Henry
Le I'oer Trench and Captain William Ooro Jonea. Two
?f the benches in the front of the gallery wero occupied
??y Mrs. Speaker Kerr and a bevy of ladies, all
brilliantly arrayed In fashionable costumes,
i *0 tlnj0 I'awscd during the waitlnj for the |
tour or nooh. Tb? crowd# o* the floor looked op ??
the gay galleries, admiring the prettier of the hosts
of pretty women who lined the tier.. In turn the
crowd looked down on tho floor at leant " long as tnejr
might safely do so, for what with the whirltn? throng
beneath and the painful line, of the Per.lan figured
carpet, which made the eye ache, and the fixed hot air
of the 111 ventilated room, a disposition to vertigo was
an early consequence ol gratifying curiosity Irom the
gallery standpoint.
Ai the precise hour of noon when the two hands on
the eagle-crowned clock overlapped each other In a
straight line, poiming to the very zenith of the great
time dial, Edward McFheraon, historical for hi. long
Clerkship, rose from behind hi. desk?looking to those
who saw him for the first time like a
Scotch divinity student?and, seizing the gavel,
brought the House to .Hence with two or
three taps. Announcicg the duty devolving upon him,
be began to call the roll. Till, proceeding enabled the
spectator, to single out the person by the name, and as
each uotablo was called hi. voice drow thousand, of
eyes upon him In scrutiny ol hi. appearance. Sunset
Cox was in a front scat, mercurial a. ever. Kerr kept
modestly In the background, and was tho cynosure oj
every eye In turn until he was known to every ono
within the chamber. His comparative youth surprised
most people, his full and healthy supply of hair being
in strong contrast to tho many bald heads and thin
hair or his fellow Congressmen. Ho wore eye glasses,
and in his suit of dark cloth with high buttoned vest,
and with smoky black whiskers running under hi. chin,
he might be taken for a professor of chomistry or a
scientist ot some kind, rather than tho statesman.
From the Speaker, so soon to be Inducted Into his
chair, tho eye of tho spectators then ran across to the
other side of the room where Pinchback sat in a little
court, comprising the half dozen colored Congressmen
and somo of his friends among the republican whites.
As the name of W. S. King was called, whisper, of
"Bill King" were heard, and his answer directed
attention to the ex Postmaster of the House. He sat
In the front row to the left ol the Clerk, presenting a
very calm pfrtonncL HI. rubicund, .olid face was
shaven of every liair, and us he picked his teeth he re
vealed a largo, fleshy hand, protruding above a dainty
white shirt culf. He was as much the Impersonation of
self-possession as was Turveydrop or deportment. At
tho name or Alexander H. Stephens neck, were craned
to see the Vice President of the Confederacy, but the
call elicited no response. The Imperial form of Fer
nando Wood was conspicuous In tho centre of the floor.
Iu front ot him a few benches sat Lamar, easily known
by his Andrew Jackson-llko head and hi. raiment of
Quaker brown. Blaino, like Kerr, kept iu the rear,
surrounded by the leaders of his party.
At length the roll of 292 names was finished. There
were only six absentees, an unusually small number
Tho vote for Speaker was then taken, and Kerr
was declared elected by 173 votes. The liberal, and
independents divided their votes in the proportion of j
about two to one betwocn Kerr and Blaine. Banks
flred a blank cartridge In declaring lor A. S. Williams.
Tho Clerk now appointed Messrs. Randall and Blaine a
committee to conduct the Speaker to tho chair. As the
two gentlemen met in tho middlo aisle they shook
hands very warmly, and then, facing about, they
inarched up the aisle, their large, commanding forms
exciting general admiration. Accosting Kerr they
gave him each an arm and, all three linking, they
conducted him to the Speaker's chair amid a round of
applause. Arrived there Tie stood in the Speaker's
place, while W. D. Kelly, as Father of the House,
administered tho oath of office. Tho swearing in of the
House followed and hero, for the first time, the
spectators drow breath. Swearing being so common a
matter in this country, the proceedings now began to
lose their Interest, and the orowd speedily thinned out.
Half on hour had boen consumed In calling the roll
and three quarters of an hour In voting lor Speaker.
Another hour had been taken up In swearing
in the members when the smooth current of
busine.s was, for the first time, broken, the
occasion being the Introduction or a resolution by Fer
nando Wood to refer the contest ot Messrs. Morey and
Spencer, of Louisiana, to the Committee on Elections.
This brought Blaine to hi. feet, and the first wrangle of
the Forty-fourth Congress began. It lasted about two
hours. Indeed, it might have gone on Indefinitely had
not Lamar, In a spirit of Mrness and concession, If not
compromise, offered an amendment, referring only the
case or Morey to the Committee on Elections for verifica
tion, instead of giving to the McEuery delegate the quasi
prestige of recognition by coupling the two names to
gether. Thl? amendment was acccptod by Wood and
I the resolution adopted by the House.
I During the debate, which was warmly conducted on
1 both sides, Wood and Lamar led the democracy and
i Blaine and Whoeler the opposition. It looked as if tho
conforenco la-st night at Wood's had resulted in an as
j eignment to htm and Lamar of the part they sustained
\ to day in this controversy. Tho skirmish was lively
enough to show that the two parties will do somo sharp
| work and heavy fighting beforo the June roses bloom.
; THE MOVEMENT TO UNSEAT PRESIDENT FERRY.
Senator Morton says that there is no strength In the
movement to unseal President Ferry. Although several
i Senator, have suggested his resignaton, Senator Ferry
I does not Intend to take any notice of their request.
A slip was handed him reading:?
Moral for Senators.?When they are electing a Presi
dent pro tern, they must be careful thai ho is not likely
J to become President.
Ho laughed heartily over It and took the slip. He is
t somewhat concerned over llj but he deports himself
J with a show of increased dignity while transacting
business in the room of the Vice President.
LOUISIANA AFFAIRS SIMMERING THE PROS
PECTS FOR PINCHBACK's ADMISSION.
Senator Wost says that affairs in Louisiana are "slm
meriug" and that there will shortly be an explosion.
1 Be thinks the admission of Pinchback will bo immedi
ately moved and that a great many Senators who have
heretofore oppoeod his admission will voto for him
when tho case comes up for action. The impression
prevails with a great many that Pinchback will
stand a fair chance for admission a.nd that he
will bo investigated afterward. Senator Morton
concurs generally with this view of the case, but does
1 not think that his admission will bo immediately urged.
' A groat many of the more high toned Senators, In order
to avoid the issue, will, it is thought, be absent when
It comes up. And again it i. freely said by Senators
that the republican party cannot afford to dispose of
Pinchback'. case in tho light of prejudice, but must
act according tg the law, else the thing will return to
plague them.
THE CASE OF GENERAL BABCOCK?AN ALLEGED
CONSPIRACY TO CRUSH PRESIDENT GRANT?
THE ATTORNEY GENERAL ON THE MILITARY
COURT.
A member of the President's family, In a long con
versation to-duy about General Babcock, said that his
! St. Louis despatches would be explained to the entire
satisfaction of his friends and of the country. Even
hi. enemies would be obliged to acknowledge his inno
ceuce when all the facts come to light. Tho despatches
relate entirely to other matters and have not tho .light
est connection with the whiskey frauds. Instead of
Bnboock being engaged in a conspiracy to gwindlo the
government and cover crime, he is alleged to be the
victim of a band of conspirators who want to crush
President Grant and hi. friends. The heads of thi.
conspiracy, .aid the gentleman referred to, are a high
ofllcial In the Troasury Department and Carl Schurz.
I Attorney General Pierrepont, in speaking on the samo
| subject this evening, said that the ctvll court Investlga
1 tlon would In no wise Interfere with the military exam
ination of the charge, against General Babcock. Ho
d;d not know that ho had been Indicted until he saw
ihe announcement to that effect In tho Hkram> to-day.
Ha would not question the authenticity of the state
ment, for he had no official knowledge of it in any way,
but he expected to know about It to morrow (Tuesday).
A remark was mado that General Babcock was ready for
trial. ,
"Yes," said tho Attorney General, "he Is prepared to
stand nis trial. A critical examination of the case will
be made and he (Babcock) is confldont of a completo
vindication."

ladies being among the audience. Tho emblems of

HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES.
Washington, D. C., Dec. 8, 1975,
The opening of tho Forty-fourth Congress was marked
by the presence in and around the Capitol of a larger
crowd of people than probably ever before watched a
similar proceodlng in Washington. Although the fore
noon was wet and dreary, the unpleasantness of the
weather seemed to have little or no effect in restraining
the eagerness ol the multitude which flowed Into tho
city within the past lew days, aud from an early hour
the galleries of the House of Representatives were filled
and parked as closely as possible. Then the ball Itself
and all tho approaches to It, the corridor#, the passages
and every available space around became gradually
filled up, until, as the hour of noon approached, It was
almost Impossible for one to make his way in any
direction through the mass. The crowd consisted for
the most part, not of tho ordinary citizens and fro
quenters of Washington, but of strangers, and it would
be safe to say that a majority of them were, directfy or
Indirectly, eager after some of the places and emolu
meota which a change of political parties iu the House
is apt to offer for a public scramble.
u AiJWniVe 0 cl0^l? i,ie House was called to order bv
Mr. Mcl herson, the Clerk of the House of the Fort/

been elected to till tho vacancy had presented credeu

to submit the question to the action ot the House.
Tll? LOUISIANA USLJCOATION.
In reference to the Louisiana delegation the Clerk
said that he had received two tela of certificates for the
Drat four districts, both sols indicating tho election of
the same parsons; that m to the Fifth diatrict he had
received two certificates, one signed by William Pitt
Kellogg, showing the election of Mr. Morey, ?nd the
other signed by John McKnery, showing the election of
Mr. Spencer, and that as Mr. Kellogg wan tho de juctu
Governor ho (tho Clerk) had acted on hia certificate and
had enrolled Mr Morey; as to the Sixth district he had
only received ono certificate, signed by Mr. Kellogg,
and he bad acted on that.
The call having been concluded the Clerk announced
that 288 members had answered to their names, the ab
sentee* being Mr. Dobbins, of New Jersey; Mr. Egbert, of
Pennsylvania (who bad returned home this morning on
account of a death in lus family); Mr. Stephens, of Geor- !

What is kuown as the ''iron-clad oath" was the torm
administered to the ineml crs generally; but sixty-one
of tho Southern members being unable to take that oath,
the modified form of oath was administered to them.
Mr. Wood, (dem.) of Now York, objected to Mr.
Morey, of Louisiana; and Mr. Garfield, of Ohio, ob
jected to Mr. Goode, of Virginia. Thereupon these
gentlemen were not permitted to qualify.
THE LOUISIANA QUESTION.
Subsequently Mr. Wimjd offered a resolution referring
tho credentials of Messrs. Morey and Sponcer to tho
Committeo on Eloctlons, with instructions to report
which of them Is entitled to tho seat. He said hu did
uot propose to raise tho question as to who was the
leual Governor of Louisiana. It was not pertinent to
tbo inquiry to determine that question, the sole and
exclusive question being as to what form of credentials
tho respectivo claimants presented.
Mr. Blaine, (rep.) of Mo., declared that there was no
moro official ground for the speaking of John McKnery
as Governor of Louisiana than there was for the speak
ing of the gentleman (Mr. Wood) as Governor of New
York. Nodepirtment of the government had ever
recognized Mr. McKnery, and tho House last session,
by a very large vote, to which many gentlemen on tho
democratic side of the House wero consenting and
many of them anxious thai the resolution should pass,
had solemnly recognized Kellogg as Governor
o( Louisiana; and for the gentleman from New
York to make a statement that the Governor
ship of Louisiana was still a matter of doubt
or was still in suspense was to place the House In a
wrong position. He thought that the Clerk would have
been perfectly justified in tearing up, as waste paper,
the credentials signed by McKuery. He trusted that
the gentleman from New York did not wish to open the
whole Louisiana case on this question.
Mr. Wood replied that the papers in the case of nil
the members lrom Louisiana were themselves a sufU
clent answer to the gentleman, for if there was no pos
sible question as to who was the Governor of Louisiana,
why was It that all the members of that Slate had
deemed It necessary to obtain the certificate of Mc
Knery? They had all deemed.lt important to come
here clothed with certificates from each of these so
called Governors. He did not pro|>ose to raise in this
inquiry tho question as to who was or who was not
Governor :fLouisiana. The question to be determined
in the first placo was whether Mr. Morey presented
credentials which entitled him lo a seal on this Hour.
Mr. Wueelsr, of New York, said he bad trusted that
the question as to who was Governor of Louisiana had
been set at rest, at least until the next general elec
tion, and regrettod that lor a paltry advantage It should
be again raised. Not only bad Kellogg been recognized
as Governor of Louisiana by the President of the
United States and by both houses, but also by the
people of Louisiana and by solemn statute passed by
its Legislature at its extra session held last April.
, Besides, this man, Spencer, had absolutely foreclosed
himself by having made himself a contestant.
Mr. Frt, (rep.) of Mo.?Is there on record since tho
I election hold In 1872 in the State of Louisiana a single
otllcial act of McKnery except this single one of sisning
those certificates t
Mr. Wiiekler, of New York?Not one.
Mr. Wood remarked that the question settled last
session had been confined entirely to the relation of the
Legislature, not lo tho election of Governor.
Mr. Lamar, of Mississippi, remarked thai the Clerk
of the House had made known to the House tho ex
istence of a controversy, not only with reference to
the merits of the question, but with refercnco to tho
prima facie right to a Beat in tho IIouso. The Houso
was in possession of the fact that thorc was such a con
troversy. It might be a very simple and a very in
telliglblo question, but still it was a question of law as
to whether this certificate was signed by the proper
Govoruor or not. It had been crystallized Into a regu
lar parliamentary law that a question Involving the
prima facie. rights as well as the merits of a case should
be referred to a committee on elections.
Mr. Blaine asked Mr. Lamar whether in the history
of the Houso he knew of any case where credentials or
pseutUt credentials of a member, signed by a pretended
Governor who bad never been recognized is the Gov
ernor by any department ot the United Slates or by
his own State, bad been referred to a committee. He
trusted that his friend I^imar, with his well kuown
moderation, would restrain his party from placing on
tho record such an outrage not only on Siato rights,
of which ho (Mr. Lamar) was such an exemplar and ad
vocate, but on the rules of common docency as well.
Mr. Lamar remarked that the question whether one
of these pretended to bo Governor or not was the very
question to bo referred to tne committee.
Mr. II la ink?Then 1 understand the gentleman to
mean that this Is the formal opening of the wholo
; Louisiana case, and not tuorely a question as to the
?eat of the member.
Mr. Lamar?The gentleman simply understands that
a question which the Clerk of the House has remtited to
the House?whether or not it involves tho other ques
tion as to the validity of the gubernatorial Incumbent
of Louisiana?Is a question which ought not to be de
cided informally in the mere seating of a member, but
ought to bo formally referred to committee and gravely
and maturely decided.
Mr. Blaine?Is it not a matter of history that last
year in what was known as the Louisiana adjustment
it was perfectly understood that the vote of the House
declaring Keil-jgg to be Governor was a final settlement,
j and whether the venerable gentleman from Georgia
(Mr. Stephens), the very Nestor of the democratic parly
Had not voted with the republicans in order avowedly
thai it nughl be a final settlement? I)ld his honorable
friend (Mr I.amar) eomo here now to head a movement
lo trample on the oiher sldo of that agreement and to
reopen the whole case?
Mr. Lamar admitted that there had been a compro
mise last session, and that that compromise did ac
knowledge Kellogg as the acting Governor of Louisiana.
He hoped that iho gentleman from New York (Mr.
Wood) would, acting on tho suggestion of Mr. Hoar, of
Massachusetts, modify his resolution by omitting the
presmble and merely referring the matter to the Com
1 in i t lee on Elections with instructions to report on tne
, prima facie case.
Mr. Wood modified his resolution accordingly.
The Clicks of the House, wllh the permission of tho
House, made the following statement:?
STATEMENT BY TUB CLERK.
The controlling fact which, in my Judgment, required
me to accpl the Kellogg certificates was that prior to
the making up of the roll on the 4th of March last
there bad been a recognition by iho House of Kopre
seniatives of William Pitt Kellogg as Qovernor of
iAiulrfiana, and at that time he was the fa fncto Got
ernor of the Slat*. In view of his recognition by the
Executive branch of the government, by all the de
partments of the government, and by that portion of
the legislative branch of tho government to which the
Clerk is responsible, 1 felt myself absolutely concluded,
and therefore I inserted the names returned by Gov
ernor Kenogg, Without any reference whatever to tho
political aspect of the case.
After further discussion, participated in by Messrs.
Holiuan, of Indiana; Banks, or Massachusetts; Cox, of
New York; and Jones, of Kentucky, the previous
question was seconded. Tne main question was or
dered. Yeas, LIS; nays, 134.
The question was thon put on tho resolution and It
was rejected. ?
Mr. Blains, (rep ) of Me., then moved that Frank
Morey, having presented credentials signed in duo
form by Governor Kellogg, bo sworn In as a member.
Mr. Randall, (dem.) of Pa., suggested to strike out
of the motion that part recognizing Kellogg as Go?
ernor.
Mr Bi.at5R said that he was willing to do so, and,
having so modified It, tho motion was agreed to with
out a division, and Mr. Morey was sworn in as a mem
ber.
The question ss to the right of Mr. Goode, of Vlr
ginia, was next tauen up, and after a short discussion
Mr. Goode was sworn in as a member, taking tho modi
licd oaltk
The question as ike Taraacy IB tne Thtrty-tb;rd
district of New York was then taken up, and after
?UlWiiati by Messrs. Wketltr, Nortog and Cox, the
Representative elect ni sworu in and the technical
question involved In the case waa referred to the Com
mittee on Elections.
The delegate* from the Territories were then called
ana sworn in; all el them taking the iron clad oath,

Mr. Lamar then oflerod a resolution declaring the fol- |

of Kentucky; Neageam ut Arms, John O. Thompson, of 1
Ohio; I>oorkeopcr, Lafayette N. Fitzbugh, ol Texas I

lain, Rev 1 L. Townsend, of the District of Columbia
Mr. Whcklir. of New York, offered an amendment,
substituting the names of the present incumbents (if
those offices, Messrs Mcpherson, Ordway, Sherwood 1
and Kutler.
Tbe amendment waa rejected and the original reso- '
lution adopted.
The newly elected oflWrs were then sworn in, !
Messrs. FiWhugb and Stewart taking the modified

On motion of Mr. Holma* a message was pent to the
Senate to Inform that body that ilio House was organ- i
ized and ready for business.
On motion of Mr. Cox, of New Yorlc, a committee
was appointed to Join a like committee on the pari ol 1

that Congress waa now in session, and was ready to re- j
ce.ve any communication he might please tu make
to it
Messrs. Cox, of New York, Knott, of Kentucky, and |
Blame, of Maine, were appointed such committeo.
Mr. Kaxoall, (of Pa.) offered resolutions adopting
the rules of tbe House in tbe Forty third Congrest aa
tlio rules of the present Honso, except Rules 106 and
107, and also providing for tho appointment of a Com
mittee on Rules, to consist of the Speaker and lour
members.
[ltules 1M and 107 are those Adopted In the last Con
gress requiring motions to suspend the rules to be sec
onded by a majority, aud forbidding the eutertaiument
Of dilatory motions.]
Mr. Gakfikij) suggested that by Immemorial usage
tho rules of the preceding Houses became tbe rules ol
this House without any special motion to that effect.
Mr. Randall replied that immemorial usage might
do for the republican side of the House but not fbr tbe
democratic tide, which requirod a strict construction
of the rule.
Mr. GAJiriKLD(contemptuously)?Oh, yes. (Laughter.)
The resolutions were adopted and then It was or
dered that the usual drawing for seats take place at
one o'clock to-morrow.

To tits Editor or ths Herald:?
In your issue of Saturday, December 4, injustice is ,
done me by your Washington correspondent, in saving
that 1 was pledged to vote for Mr. Randall for Speaker.
At no time or place or to any porson whatever have I
made any such pledge. promise or intimation; on tho
contrary, in an interview with gentlemen irom Penn
sylvania 1 gave reasons, personal to myself, why I could
not do so. This is a matter of no public importance,
but calculated to do me injustice, and I respectfully ask
that this card may be inserted in your next issue. Very

CHI IN A AND HER PEOPLE.
Forty-two years ago Dr. S. Wells Williams sailed
from ibis city as a missionary to China. After ibis
long ansence he roccntlv returned, and yesterday, by
Invitation of the Society of Inquiry of the Union
Theological Seminary, addressed tbe students of that
institution and many friends, so that the chapel was
well filled. He has been asked bow it comes to pass
that tbe Eastern Chinese do not tear eaih other to
pieces as do those of Western China? and his answer
has been, "Because of the Influence of tbe writings of
Confucius and tho system ot competitive examination
for government otiices." A sketch of those examina
tions was given by Dr. Williams, which created a good
deal of laughter. The examinations begin in the vil
lage, are then carried to the provincial capital and then
to the imperial capital. But out of 12,000 candidates
only seventy-two can graduate at any one examination.
China Is this year, according to its chronology, 4,513
years in existence?the oldest nation In the world.
And God, Dr. Williams believed, had preserved the
Chinese a nation for some wise purpose. Before Con
fucius' time tbe land was divided into feudal provinces,
sometimes as many as forty aud again as tew as eight.
' For the last 2,000 yeUrs or upward they
have been consolidated as one nation. In none
of Confucius'writings is there any mention of Gt>d or
of angels of a future life. Noticing ibis lack tbe Buu
dhisis havo come in with their mythology and ances
tral worship. The cultured Chinese look upon Buddhism
as a collection of old wives' fablca. But, nevertheless,
under it they worship Contucius and ten of his dis
eiples. The religion is a.curious mixture of idolatry
; and Christianity. Tho Chinese believe that heaven
aud earth united to make a man, and that man was tne
Emperor of China No other man, therefore, has any
right to worshiD heaven and oarth. If he governs the
people aright, then they will have good weather, good
crops, no sickness and no rebellion. If these results do
: not appear it Is an evidence that heaven aud earth are
displeased at his government, and he bus to step do#n
i and out ami let another who will govern according to
tho will of those powers take his place. So that the
| vox p<ypuli vox Vei is u terrible reality in China. The
i Doctor believed that Isaiah prophesied of China uuder
! the tttlo of Sinim. And the tact that its people are
| everywhere known under the titlo of Chin, Tsin or such
i like name he cons'derod a proof that they were well
known to the people of antiquity. Confucius lived in
1 the days of Ezra. There are about lorty mission
i stations In China and about 10,000 Protestant converts.
; It is hardly known how many Catholio converts there
are, but an effort is being made to prepare a history of
' missions of that land for the Centennial.
CHAMPION HAND BALL GAMES.
There was a series of band ball games played in the
I racket court, corner of Hoyt and Douglass streets,
I Brooklyn, yesterday, between Philip .Casey, United
' States champion and governor of tho court, and Mr.
Frank Burke, champion of Philadelphia. The condi
! lions were the first four in seven games, the men to
. uso only tholr right hands, for $200. These conditions
! wore made for tho reason that tho I'hiladelphinn's
| friends felt, when tbe first championship
! match was played in Brooklyn and in Phila
delphia some days ago, tluit if tho United Slates
champion were deprived of the use of his vigorous left
their man would find success. Tliero were present
many of the no ed players of Philadelphia,
Brooklyn and New York, and so great
! was the interest in the games in Philadelphia
that tho press of that city had representatives there.
Both the men appeared in tine condition and were well
received. Casey won the toss for first inning, and,
taking his hand, made 2. The succeeding hands were:?
Casey, 3, 5, ti, 4 and 1, to Burke's 0, 1, 2, 0, 1, ending
Casey 21 to Burko's 4. The second gamn ran in the In
nings as follows:?Casey, 0, 3, 6, 1, 2, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2;
Burke, 1, 4, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0. 4, 0?Cas-y, 21, Burke,
12. Third frame?Casey, 13, 1, 1, 8; Burke, 0, 4, 0,
0?Casey, 21: Hurke, 4. Tho fourth game's innings
Stood:?Casov, 2,1, 6, 0, 1, 0. 2, 2, 2, 0, 1, 2, 2, 0, 0,
1; Burke, 2, 0, 3, 1. 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0?
Casey, 21, Burke, 10.
The play w as very fine throughout on both sides,
though Casey's superiority was apparent from tbe first.
Burke, however, showed some very One cross-play in
Casey's left corner in the first game; In the second he
played strong; In the third'Casey warmed up to low
aud hard banding, and in the last and most artful
Burke seemed tired, while Casey was still fresh They
are to play agaiu Monday and Monday week In Philadel
phia.
BILLY EDWARDS' BENEFIT.
The "benefit" of Billy Edwards, the well known "pro
fessor of the manly art of self-defence," takes place
to-night at Turn Hall. Fourth street, and is likely to be
a great success. Billy Is extremely popular.
now PUBLIC MONEY GOES.
Ex Attorney General Gilchrist states In reference to
the payment of the public money to James Curran by
the Board of Freeholders In Jersey City that every
such payment was illegal and that the Connty Col
lector can bo held responsible. He concurs entirely in
the statement of the case ss given In yesterday's
Hhrald. Another alleged illegal payment of the pub
lic money In connection with tbe samo Board and in a
precisely similar transaction came to light yesterday.
Wilbur N. Wlckham was elected Freeholder from the
Sixth district, but the seat was usurped by Henry Van
Horn, who was soon ousted by tbe Supreme Court.
The director of tho Board, Mr. Young, In deflancc ofthe
decision of the Court, deducted the amount of tho
salary due Mr. WickhaTh and paid It to Van Horn, wbo
was simply an intruder, according to the opinion ofthe
ex-Attorney General. Suits will be immediately com.

CHARITABLE BEQUESTS
The amount of the estate loft by the late W lium B.

cannot fail to be a matter of interest to tl.c public.
Tho fortune of the Astor iamily is to Intimately associ
ated with the growth, prosperity and present wealth ol
this city tnat, although it has always been largely a
family matter, It is, iu another sense, largely a pnblio
matter. Tho value of the estate left by Mr. Astor ba?
been variously and vaguely estimated all the way from
140,000,000 to $200,000,000, and, considering the pres
ent depreciated value of real estate Id this city, the for
mer amount is likely to be more nearly the true esti
mate. But on this point even hiB heirs and executors
profess to be able, at present, to make but a mere
guess. This vast estate?vast at any of the estimates
made?must necessarily involve many questions of
legal importance, all of which have been placed in
charge of the emineut legal Arm, Messrs. Evarts, Sonth
