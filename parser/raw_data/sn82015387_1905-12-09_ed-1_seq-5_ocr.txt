Night Watchman Killed
By Log Train.
An accident that resulted in &the
death. Otmar Wrenck, .the night
watchman of the Greenlaw Lom
her Company's large mill at Ram
say, three miles north of here, took
place last 3londay.
It seems that Wrenck, who had
spent Sunday to Covington, was on
his way back to Ramsay and walk
ing up the track of the New Or
leans Great Northern. When just
above the mile branch he etbher
lay down beside the track or fell
and was stunned, and was there
when the log train passed up at
about 10 o'clock in the morning.
The noise of the train evidently
aroused him, and as he rose the
train struck him on the head and
fractured his skull. His left leg
and left arm were badly mangled.
He was attended by Dr. Marrero,
and brought to Covington. Mr.'
Greenlaw had him placed on the
train to be taken to the Charity
Hospital, but be died shortly be
fore the train reached the city.

Baton Rouge, Hammond l
and Eastern Organized.
The Baton Rouge. Hammond and c
Eastern Railway Company was or- e
ganized last week at a meeting (f I
the directors, which was held at a
Baton Rouge. It is specfieally a
stated by those back of the road e
that the orgamnization perfected is
simply of a temporary nature,
which would indicate that at some F
time in the not distant future the b
road will be taken over as s part of
some other system. Mr Wexler
was elected President and Mr Du.
four Vice President of the new b
company.
The right of way has been se. c
cured all the way from Baton Rouge t
through Covington and Hammond b
to Pearl River, where a connection e
will be made with both the New
Orleans and Northeastern and the
New Orleans Great Northern. The
parishes of East Baton Rouge and d
Tangipahoa have both voted taxes,
and one precinct in lIivington did
the same. c,
The headquarters of the road are a
to be at Hammond, where the peo
ple gave a large amount of land for tl
that purpose. The Illinois Central 1
main line will be crossed at Ham
mond. In all, the line will be about
seventy miles long. Grading will p
commence at once, and as the ties
have already been ordered, con
struction work wdl proceed very
rapidly.
