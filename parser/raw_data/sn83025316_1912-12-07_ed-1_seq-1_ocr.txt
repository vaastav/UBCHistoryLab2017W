PRESIDENT TAFT'S MESSAGE
SAYS HE'LL LET NEXT CON
GRESS FIGHT OVER IT.
HEI I FOR GOETHALS
Recomminld rd That Builder of Panama
Canal Be Promoted to Be Major Gen
eral-Opposes Granting of Inde
pendence to Philippines - Wants
Water Power Laws Amended.
RECOMMENDATIONS.
Washington, Dec. 6.-President
Taft's principal recommendations
in his message to congress today:6
The plan of currency reform out
lined by the monetary commission.
Amendment of the law to lessen
the, penalty when corporations in
advertently disobey the corpora
tion tax law.
Congressional approval of plan
of army reorganization prepared by
the war college last spring.
The passage of the militia pay
bill increasing compensation to
militia in the field.
Citizenship without statehood for
Porto Rico.
I;ýgulation of water power grant
ed so that navigable streams might
be improved by water power corn
panies.
Balevation of Colonel Goethals,
builder of the Panama canal, to a
major generalship.
A return to the policy of two
battleships a year by the appro
priation for three battleships this
year.
Apthority to the United States
supreme court to make rules of
procedure in common law cases in
federal court to expedite and les
sen.the cost of litigation.
He disapproved the following:
Autonomy and independence in
eight years for the Philippines.
Amendment of the Sherman an
ti-trust law.
The president made no recom
mendations for tariff revision,
stating he would leave that sub
ject to the incoming congress.
Washington, Dec. 6.-President Taft
will make no further effort to have
congress, reduce the tariff. In a
"general" message to congress sub
mitted today, the president clearly in
dicated his intention of leaving fur
ther tariff revision to Mr. Wilson and
the congress just elected.
"Now that a new congress has been"
elected on a platform of tariff for
revenue only rather than a protective
tariff and is to revise the tariff on
that basis," said the president; "it is
needless for me to occupy the time of
congress with arguments or recom
mendptlons in favor of a protective
tariff."
Thia message, the second submitted
by the president since the present ses
sion began, will be his last of a gen
eral .character. It dealt with every
dephrtment of the govermncment except
the state department, recommended
much of the legislation which 1Mr.
Taft previously had urged upon the
attention of congress, and took up
and discussed at length several sub
jects comparatively new.
The Philippines.
Mr. Taft came out strongly against
independence for the Philippines, pro
posed, he said, in a bill now before
congress. Hle deprecated the new
policy of on0 battleship a year ,in
stead of two; anid indorsed again the
scheme of currency reform proposed
by the national monetary commission.
Conservation was lightly touched, the
president recommending the amend.
ment of bills now before congress so
that water power companies which
dam navigable rivers will contribute
to the improvement of these streams.
He declared that no radical change
in the Sherman anti-trust law was
needed, and praised the supreme
court for its. recently announced

BUTTE STRAW BOSSES
LOSE THEIR PRIVltEGE
Butte, Dec. 6.-(Special)-A special
meneting of the Butte miners' union
was held tonight in the city Auditor
ium to protest against the card rust
ling system recently inaugurated by
the Anaconda Copper Mining com
pany. Following a number of fiery
speeches,, the megting broke up into
two factions with a committe ap
pointed to confer further with the
nmine owners. Formerly miners seek
ing employment besieged the mines
when the shifts *rent on. Now it is
necessary for an applicant to obtain
a card and the employment is given
from a cei.ral station. This system,
it is said, prevents mine foremen
seeking compensation for giving for
eigners employment.
GIRLS SPOKE FIRST
IN NUMEROUS
CASES
Los Angeles, Dec. 6.-"Of the
6.973 applicants for marriage li
censes so far this year," said Clerk
Sparks of the marriage license bu
reau, "more than 200 admitted
mitted that the girl spoke first."
Sparks' comment was elicited by
the realization that but 25 more
days remained of this leap year.
He said leap years always showed
a healthy increase in the number
of marriage licenses issued but did
not look up the divorce records for
he corresponding period.

DRAFT OF 1ERMS
FOR TURKEY
MEMBERS OF BALKAN LEAGUE
SAID TO BE GETTING TO
GETHER RAPIDLY.
London, Dec. 6.-Pending the as
sembling of the peace delegates in
London the IBalkan allies are occu
pied in preparing a joint draft of the
demands to be made upon Turkey
and, it is understood, exchanging com
munication with a view to arriving at
an agreement defining their obliga
tions to one another.
The formal acceptances of all the
powers to send delegates to the am
tIassadorial conference, to be held in
London, have not been received, but
there is no reason to suppose there
will be any delay i nthe assembling of
the conference.
The position of Greece in refusing to
sign the armistice 'remains unchanged.
Tho 'Greeks are said to be continuing
'their camrpaign in the island of Chios
and at Janina, and their ships are
sea!ilhing closely foreign steamers
found between the Dardanelles, and
Smyrna.
It is reported from Vienna that Ser
via has set up several batteries on
'the right bank of the Danube, oppos
ite the Hungarian town of Orzova.
Bulgaria and. Turkey.
Ionidon, Dec. 7.--A dispatch to the
Daily Telegraph from Sofia says that
if Solaniki is internationalized, Bul
garia will devote all her financial
energy to the establishment of a great
town and seaport at Orfano, south
east of Serres, and the building of a
railway straight down the Strunma
valley to 'the sea, placing Sofia in dl
rect and easy communication with the
iMediterranean. If 'this railway should
be built, correspondent adds, Saloniki
woull lose much of its impnllortance.
A dispatch to the same newspaper
from Vienna declar.es that Bulagria
and Turkey have agreed in principle
on peace and are ready for an alli
ance.
Both countries, the correspondent
adds, are so well acquainted with each
other's intentions that they could dif
fer and sign a peace treaty within 4&
hours.
The correspondent concludes by de
claring that peace in the Balkans
probabl.y will levoe Adrianople and
Saloniki internationalized.
Vienna Chosen.
London, iDce. 7.--Telegraphing from
Instan.tlnople, the corresponde'nt of
the Daily Express asserts that Vien
na has been chosen as the scene for
peace negoitiations betwcen Turkey
'and (ireece. He says the Turkish am
bassador at Vienna has received full
powers to negotiate with the (Greeks,
and that he will be -assisted by Oz
man Nishlni Pasha, the Turkish anS
bassador to Glermany.
FORGERY CHARGED.
Spokane, Dec. 6.-Thomas Crow, a
stenograpiher, was arrested today on
a charge of forgery sworn to by James
Martin, a special agent of the Oregon
'Washington Railroad & Navigation
company. The charge was made in
connection with the cashing of rall
road pay checks. Checks totaling
about $5,000 were lost or stolen a
week ago, while enroute from Port
land to Wellace, Idaho. Fourteen of

ht
Miles City, Dec. 6.-(Speieal)-James hI
Kelly, manager of the grain elevator ar
at Plevna, and a wellknown milling
man of eastern Montana was found en
tangled today in the flywheel of the en
gine which operates the plant. Prac
tically every bone in his body was Ir

KANSAS TOWN WANTS
TO RENT EMPTY JAILS
Larned, Kan., )De. . -A "For Rent"
sign was tacked up today on the jail
of Iord, In Ford county, by the town
council of that ,lace with the recom
mendation that the building would
mnake an admirable chicken house.
Ford has not had an occupant in
its jail for two years antd a half.
Today's action of the council con
stituted the latest move in a virtue
contest between Ford and Hugoton, a
small town in Stevens county. A
month ago the Stevens county cornm
missioners became so disgusted with
the long absence of prisoners from the
county jail in HIugoton, that they
rented the prison to a farmer. Ford
citizens, proud of their empty jail,
urged the city fathers to follow Hugo
tons' lead.

IDEAOF GREAT CITIES
IS OPPOSED BY BRYCE
1'Philadtlphlia, Dec. 6.--Great cities
arc an evil in tlhlnselves and civiliza
tion by legislation should encourage
in their placeo many cities of not mlore
than 100,000 population, said James
iryce, the iritish amlbassador, here
tonight in an address at the banquet
of the second National }Housing con
ference.
Ambassador Bryce cited examples of
cities that contain one-third and oven
one-half tile population of the coun
tries in which they are situated, men
tioning particularly Sydney, Buenos
Ayres, and Montevideo as being great
mistakes of civilization.
lHe spoke in favor of the garden city
idea in which each home is surround- i
ed by a plot of ground.
