POLITICAL PARTIES.
When the present Administration c.une
into power, neither the lteiublican nor
Poiiiocmtio parly was fully and imiini
immsly agreeil us to their respective poli
cies. There were radical nnd conservative
Republicans opposed by Breckinridge and
liouglas Democrats. But the incidents of
the rebellion have -wrought great cha iges
in Northern parlies. When the first news
of the I bardment of Fort Slimier I an
with lightning speed throughout tho coun
try, old party lines instantly vanished, nud
the great majority of the North rallied as
one man in response to the call ot the Gov
ernment for troops. True, then' were those
in the North who sympathized with and
wished the reoels success ; but for the tin:e
they were practically subdued by the up
rising of the loyal masses.
Tho course of events, however, has
changed the political current. While loyal
ncn tilled our armies, the "sympathizers"
remained at home, and disloyal leadcis, by
taking advantage of defeats and delays,
nud misrepresenting nnd censuring the
Government, when it was compelled to
deal harshly wi'.h those seeking its over
throw, have rallied a powerful political
combination, ami at the present stale ol
affairs there live two earucsUy unite I par
tie in the North the or.e thoroughly sup
porting the Government in every effort to
rrusli lie' rein llion. even lit the sacrifice ol
slavery, and evincing a determination to
piosccute the war just as long as tnei e is
u rebel squa 1 o resist; the other sympa
thising w ith the rebels, desirous of e.uii
promising with nnd yielding eipial lights to
those who have been the means of distract
ing the country nnd hen ling wailing lo many
thousands of once happy homes.
In some localities, however, where the
Democrats me to weak too seriously think
of obtaining the local otliccs without a
sisuuco, there is a pai n yovcssi'i; to dif
fer with both the foregoing - a parly which
eiiginally huiuchoj out on tho political sea
with the intention, of taking the "Southern
brother by the band, and saying we, too.
have boon to blame." This " commend.-
bio " enterprise having failed, most of those
cupped in it li.ivo rotunici to their tonner

POLITICAL PARTIES. GHOULS OF THE PRESS.
Fu:no limu 'sine noted I'nion man in
Missouri Was ea)lm e l by n bund a of the
iinineroits guerrilla marandeiK intent, tig tlnt
State, snd General McNeil, n Federal ofliocr,
f;av liotico that if the ruptured man was
not returned tn a Riven time, be would
shoot ton guerrilla bandits. The I'nion
nun was not returned, and the ten ptuiril
his were shot.
At this "many of tho BoreHsioti-syrnpathi.-ing
journals of the North arc setting tip a
bowl of indignation, branding; General Me
Neil as a " murderer," nnd etuitn that he
has, by this just retributive art, disraeed
the Federal arms. This uet has likewise
railed forth the indignation of tho hicIi
traitor Jc If. P.ivis, and he swears terrible
vengeance. It is met. theiefore, that
those papers which condemn ami denounce
every loyal luensuro taken for tho suppres
sion of tho rebellion, should likewise howl,
when S.'eessia is meeting the just recom
penso of itj;rcnt national crime.
The facts are that Iho ten guerrillas nhot
were raptured sonic time in tho Huuituer.
nnd wine discharged on their piirolo of
honor not to take up urius against the I'ni
toil States authorities until exchanged
They were afterward raptured with nrnis
in thrir b inds, fighting the I'nioii troops
and for this violation of their parole do
served the punishment of death, nr-cording
to the rides of war.
" McNeil has disgraced tho Federal
nrni't ! " Huoli in the cry of these lion's of
the press. I'retty Hpecimens, indeed, to
upeak of disgrace ! Ji lTf. P.kviw, tho bitter
enemy of our Government, who has eon
spired ujrainst it, and is seeking by every
means within his power to destroy it, do
iii.vnls lln surrender to him of McNeil, iiii'l
wo have those among lis so lost to every
principle of patriotism. honor and manhood
who nay that "tho Administration will per
form a just and righteous net by delivering
up McNeil to Jell', llavis-- to be disposed ol
as tho latter may determine ! " To add fur
ther to their depravity, they assert tho lie
that bysodoing Iho Admiiiiatrntioii "Would
gratify the public wish in tho mutter I
Was ever lie re ii lie more monstrous?
Such i:i indeed the wish of the enemies of
our Hepublic but not tho wish of the loya
millions to be found within her limits
It is not (lingular tit all that these jour
uahi and these men should seize upon every
n't committed y loyal men that results in
,,;,.,,., ,,, I",.ljl, ttll, tr,.iwn. It is
only in keeping with their principles. In
their professions of loyally --and they ur
only pi on Hsi ius lliey have no won!
condemnation for any of Iho lea Ins of the
rebellion men who have ruthlessly tiam
pled upon the Constitution who are now
with demoniac zeal attempting the ruin of
our liberties in whoso wake nothing lias
followed but blood, rapine, ruin -men lost
lo every principle and feeling id' Immunity
not a word of condemnation for these
M ini -devils in human shape.
The pirate Alabama roams tin seas in her
career of murder nnd robbery. No word
of condemnation from these sclf-conutitulcd
judges of justice and crime.
John Morgan, the !an 1 pirate, whose
deeds far eclipse those of John A. Mitrrill.
iu still unhung. No word id' condemnation
for his m is of murder ami barbarity.
Many of the loyal men of K ist Tennessee
have been dragged from their homes, robbed
of their propel ly, their wives and daugh
tcis violated, and tlicmsclvv hung for their
devotion to the 1'uion, by (hu hunjin fiends
and blind devotees of secession. No word
against these acts.
f' very atrocity thut the brain nnd heart
of a li 'iid can dictate atrocities unpalal
lelled iu the luslory of tho. world, iu any
age or nation, have been peipnt rated by
our 'Southern brethren" atrocities, the
bare mention of which will curdle the
blood, hi inch the cheek, and make the heart
stand still with horror. Vet no wold of
condemnation from such journals as me
ever ready to condemn and censure the acts
nud proceedings of the true nn 1 loyal men
of the country! Out upon such recreants
let their names descend to the inl.iiuy
their iniquitous course so richly incrils.
THE "DIVINITY" OF SLAVERY.
If the emancipation Proclamation of
President l.'iicoln was to icsult in no prac
tical Ijcrrlit toour country, it at least would
materially niii Iho cause of Immunity, by
being the ne ans of exploding ,'ho slaveholders'
doctrine of the "divinity" ol
j slavery. The friends of the " peculiar in-
miration luive scarcely ever entered into
a controversy concerning its merits, with
out asserting that tho relation of master nud
slase, like that of parent and child, was
sanctioned by Divine Power; that both
would nl.ke endure to the end of time, and
weru e.pudiy binding and agreeable lo all
parties. In some respects the two rela
tions may have t een similar, but the doe-
" 'i''eiei irom ttteoty m
I'lrtotice- It both, weio e.iimlly estubliahod

while the masters are u titieiiinj; for pro
