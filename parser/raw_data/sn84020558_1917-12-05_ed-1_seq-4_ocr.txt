WEDNESDAY MORNING. DECEMBER B, 1917
There is no danger of a spirit of
militarism manifesting itself in a
icountry which has no desire for con
quest. Anonymous.
The Message
The outstanding feature of the president's mes
sage, read to congress yesterday, was its uncompro
mising attitude toward the enemies of civilization.
It is evident that whatever may have been thought,
or may he thinking In the chancelleries of Europe
regarding peace terms, the president has given them
no consideration, and is not now in a temper to accept
or offer terms which do not include the permanent
powerlessness of Prussianism to plunge the world
into a sea of blood again.
In this respect, the message is a reiteration of
that which preceded the declaration of a state of war
against Germany. The message contains on that
score, nothing new. It makes it the more difficult for
us to join in any compromise with Germany for the
ending of the war. Even if the unexpected should
happen, and France and Great Britain, brought to
their knees should be forced to consent to a peace
which could only be temporary, the United States
is barred hf the message from participation in such
a peace. In this attitude, the president reflects the
sentiment of the American people.
The president's recommendation for a declaration
of war asainst Austria was forseen. In fact, it was
unavoidable any longer. The developments of the
Italian campaign forced such a recommendation. Why
a similar one was not made as to Turkey and Bul
garia is not explained. It was probably withheld by
the president in the hope, which must be a slender
one at the best, that those countries, dissatisfied with
their alliance with the Central Powers, may of them
selves, sever that relation. It must be admitted that
If there Is such a prospect of which we have no sign,
a declaration against them would drive them more
closely to the alliance.
But against the probability, or rather, the possi
bility of their falling away of their own weight from
the Central I'owers, we have the danger of the con
tinued presence of their representatives at the na
tional capital, with opportunities for fpyir.g, and the
contingency that in the kaleidoscope of the war, we
may be brought face to face with their armies in
the field.
It is only in the neg'.cct to recommend a declara
tion of war against these powers that the American
people can find fault with the message.
Hold the War Bonds
It has been noticed that the Liberty Bonds are
figuring in the reports of the New York Stock Ex
change. The 3'i's were reported soon after the sub
scriptions were taken last summer and before the
bonds themselves had been issued. The 4's which
were subscribed only a little more than a month ago
were quoted on the exchange before the subscription
period ended. The 4's yesterday were quoted at 37.90
end 57.82; the S'i's at 9S.90 to 93.
In ail parts of the country we suppose in every
town. Liberty Bonds in small volume, of course, may
be exchanged for merchandise at their face value
and thousands of the bonds have been so exchanged.
We suppose in many cases holders of the bonds have
been forced by necessity to part with them but in
most cases there has been no such necessity only
convenience has been served.
Buyers of Liberty Bonds, as a rule, did not pur-
chase them in the way of speculation. While it is
true that the bonds could reasonably be expected
some time to bring more than par, the interest rate
was so low that It was not attractive. The purchase
of the bonds was undertaken as a patriotic duty. But
the man who purchased them and then immediately
sold them, by the latter act undid all that he had
done; he might as well not have purchased them in
the first place.
The government, of course, has received or will
receive the money for all the purchases, but the un
loading of these bonds on the market, wil have a bad
effect on future government offerings.
The people at large, and it is the people at large
who It was desired should take these bonds, would
naturally be adversely influenced by the market fig
ures of the two issues of Liberty Bonds. The av
erage man unfamiliar -with bonds cannot see why a
government security should sell at a discount. To
him It appears there is a lack of confidence, if not
In the government, at least in the security, as an in
vestment. He does not take into account the inability
of the market to absorb all offerings at once the
natural operation of the law of supply and demand.
It Is absolutely certain that these bonds will some
time bear a premium, but it was unreasonable to
expect that a premium would attach to them at once.
If there had been such a demand as was necessary to
raise them to a premium immediately it would have
satisfied itself by original purchases of the bonds.
It P. as reasonably expected though that the 3'V
would quickly be sought on account of the im
munity ftom sur-tax feature, and it is that feature
that now holds them so nearly at par in spite of the
heavy offerings. Undoubtedly but for this unexpected
Influx these bonds would now be sought at a good
premium. -
It is a prime necessity to the purposes (and re
quirements of the government that these bonds be
distributed among, and absorbed by, the people whose
savior we not likely to be merged with great ac
cumulations of capital for carrying on th country's
business. These saving may be large or small. They
may be sufficient for the purchase only of a single
bond or they may be great enough for the purchase
of thousands of them. The confidence of tlie peo
ple in these bonds as an investment must be main
tained.
The bonds which have been, thrown upon the
market have not come from small, individual holders,
bu generally, from banks and other financial insti
tutions which, under the spur of the Liberty Loan
drive took them. It is urged now that instead of un
loading them in this manner which produces tw.o evil
effects, that of hammering down the value of the
bonds, and that of encroaching upon the country's
accumulated tSpital, they continue to distribute them
among the people that they may be absorbed by cur
rent saving.
A Belated Flirtation
A belated dispatch from Petrograd describes
Bulgaria's aspirations for an extension of territory
and a willingness to enter into negotiations with the
entente looking to such an accomplishment. A con
versation between one eminent Bulgarian and a dip
lomat whose name is witheld is repeated. In it a
hope is held out to the Bulgarians of not only the
preservation of the integrity of Bulgaria but of the
acquisition of the Dobrudja for the loss of which
Rumania would be recompensed by the gift of Bessar
abia. None of the demands of Bulgaria are denied.
Among them is a strip of Serbia.
Whether any such informal negotiation has taken
place may well be doubted, but if so, it has come about
two years too late. There was a time when Bulgaria
was on the fence with a leaning toward the entente.
The allies, though, lost a golden opportunity by flirt
ing with Greece and Rumania. Rumania was supposed
to be the dominating military power of the Balkans.
Its proximity to Russia on the one side and to Austria
on the other made it especially desirable to the allies.
The Russian debacle at that time was not forseen.
With Rumania joined to the entente there would be
In the Balkans a repetition of the result of the second
Balkan war. and Turkey would be cut off from the
Central PSwers. Such a result, of course, would
follow an enlistment of Bulgaria with the entente..
But Bulgaria and Rumania with their clashing inter
ests could not be on the same side.
Meanwhile the Germans assiduously cultivated
Bulgaria, feeling that Rumania would be easily "pock
eted" at the proper time. They were also striving for
the situation which has been brought about in Russia
in which Rumania has ceased to be a factor in the
war. It is now plainly seen, of how much greater
importance was then the geographical position of
Bulgaria, to say nothing of her superior military
position over Rumania.
When Bulgaria finally cast its lot with the Central
I'owers, British newspapers, more far-seeing than the
British foreign office, declared that Germany had
won a diplomatic victory worth many victories in
the field, one whose results would be more far-reaching
than those of any or all battles that had yet been
fought on land or sea.
That has long since been patent to the whole
world. With Bulgaria on the side of the entente, and
though Rumania were ranged with the Central Powers,
Turkey would have been severed from the latter and
by this time have been out of the war.
Bulgaria would perhaps rather trust the entente
than the Central Powers. If Germany should win,
whatever territorial aggrandizement might result to
Bulgaria, it would still be in Mittel Europa under the
shadow of Germany. With the entente victorious,
the smaller nations would suffer no interfernce from
the allies except such as would assure their protec
tion. That consideration standing alone would prob
ably influence Bulgaria, but now it cannot stand
alone. The progress of the war has isolated it from
the allies and would leave it to the mercy of the
Germans. Two years ago Bulgaria would have been
in touch with the Russians on one side and the
Italians on the other. Then was the time for diplomacy.
WHAT MARY ROBERTS RIN EH ART'S CREED IS
Mary Roberts Rinehart says in the October Amer
ican Magazine:
"For twelve years out of that forty I have been
a writer. It is as if, at twenty-eight, I had turned at
a right angle to my former path, a path which had
seemed as fixed as the sun In its orbit, or the alphabet
or a cement pavement, and had begun a journey into
a far country. It changed my life somewhat ,it
changed me entirely.
"The on ething which has, thank God, remained
unchanged, has been my family.
"In all of my life I have never before sat down and
turned my eyes inward. I have never had time to sit
by the fire and feel. My life has been purley obpective,
my family and my work the family first. It is not
easy now to put my philosophy into words. Probably
it could be done in two words, love and work. " And
that, after all, is th efoundation of every normal life.
"Love and work, and to live life to its fullest, and
with honor, that seems to me the universal creed. To
takeone's self lightly; and one's work seriously, to be
a good friend and a poor enemy, to work hard and
play hard, to look out and not in, has been the goal I
have struggled for. I have failed of course. Is not
the very fact that I am Writing this an indication that
I am beginning to take myself seriously?"

PRESIDENT WILSON'S NEWEST SADDLE
HORSE IS BELIEVED TO BE HIS BEST
- A typpx: i '! im:
How shall the poor man, the labor
ing man wfio has managed to purchase
$50 Liberty Bond, how shall he pro
tect his bond?
The bonds are navable to bearer.
Therefore, a $ni) Liberty Bond in the
nouse is just the same as $50 in gold
laying about, just like thai much cur
rency hidden in the bureau drawer,
nd it can be stolen and disposed of
ust as easily.
The man of wealth who owns manv
thousands in Liberty Bonds has placed
his bonds along with other valuable
papers, in his safety deposit box, and
the rent of one for the safe keeping
of a i'i0 Liberty Bond would take all
the interest the bond draws.
It has been suggested by a federal
reserve bank official that savings
banks who make a specialty of savings
deposits should otter to keep the poor
man's Liberty Bond for him lust to
ncourage the ownr to start a savings
deposit there. The United States ranks
lowest in the percentage, of savings
accounts, and it is thought that if
savings banks ept l'ree of charge the
pr.or man s bond, many ne-.v .t ings
tccounts wouid be started in the
country.
Another way to protect the bond
ru Mers is to have the bonds registered
in Washington. By this process the
oonus bear the purchaser's name, and
one else can receive the interest
fiom them miltss the bond is assigned
by the purchaser. Interest checks are
mailed from Washington.

HTER OF
WILD GAME IS
FilKDfi
Opening the closed season on wild
game in Arizona and also removing
the bag limit on the same during the
continuance of the war, thus aiding in
conserving the ordinary meat supply
of the country, has been agitated in
many states to the extent that it has
been taken notice of by the biological
survey.
In a letter from E. W. Nelson, chief
of the biological survey, Joe V. Pro
chaska, Arizona game warden, is asked
to give his opinion on this question of
throwing down the bars to the hunt
ers until the end of the war. The
letter is as follows:
"We shall be. greatly obliged if you
will give your views relative to the
agitation that has been started to have
all laws prescribing closed seasons and
bag limits on game birds and game
animals suspended or greatly modified
ing the winter in Arizona, visited re
cently at the home of Harry Bartley.
Mrs. Butterbaugh has returned to
her home in Mesa after a few weeks'
spent in this locality.
Mr. and Mrs. J. J. Diehl and infant
son Oval, have arrived from their home
at Thistle, Utah, to spend the winter
months with their parents, feter uieni
and wife.
Cleon Shan' recently purchased a
bean thresher from parties near Glen
dale, and by using his Ford as motive
power is getting his crop threshed and
ready for marketing.
Miss Mary Graves spent Friday as
the guest of Mrs. Walter Frigate at
the Kirchsey Ranch, near Phoenix.
Mr. and Mrs. Frank Metzler were
renewing old acquaintanceships in
Paradise Valley Thursday morning.
The Metzlers spent the winter in the
Gladeaux cottage two years ago, and
are once more in the valley for the
winter months.
Little Miss Leona Bartley has re
ceived the pink ribbon, which she won
in the Better Babies Contest at the
state fair. She was third in her class
f babies and had the excellent score
of 96. to her credit.
during the continuance of the war.
"In my opinion, such a step would
destroy the results of years of effort to
conserve the wild life of the country,
but I shall greatly appreciate a frank
statement of your views on the prob
able effect of such modification of ex
isting game laws.
"In this connection we will be pleased
to know how the number of wild fowl
in your state this year compares with
former years, and to what you attri
bute the increase or decrease in the
supply.
"How does the number of wild fowl
killed in your state this year compare
with the succeeding nree years'.'
"Has there been an increase or de
crease in the number of hunting licen
ses issued in your state? What reason
do you assign for the increase or de
crease? "E. W. NELSON, '
"Chief Biological Survey."
"I do not believe that any general
letting down of the game law bars
would be wise," declared Mr. Pro
chaska yesterday. "On the contrary, it
is a matter than should be regulated by
local conditions. In the localities
where the gasie is so numerous as to
be a pest or a nuisance, I would sus
pend the closed season laws by proc
lamation, but in the regions where the
game is scarce. I do not think it
would be wise to let the hunters in
without restriction.
"There are localities in Arizona
where it would do no harm to permit
the duck shooting to go on without
halt, such as in the Yuma Valley,
near the Mexican line. But there are
only a few such districts. The same
with the white wings and turkeys.
"There happens to be more wild
fowl in Arizona this season than for
several years, on account of the excel
lent conditions for the birds. There
has been no. great amount of snow in
the mountains to destroy the turkeys,
nor floods to kill the young flBh. For
these reasons it might do no harm
to let down the game bars in som"
localities during the continuance of the
war."

Too Late
We have recently had an illustration of the
importance of making a Will and of pro
viding for the minor heirs while in 4 4 physical
and mental" condition to do so. A careful
business man, who had acquired a consider
able estate, broke down in health three years
ago and his first thought was how to arrange
his affairs to best provide for his wife and
child. lie studied the question from every
angle for three years and finally re
quested us to draw up a Will and a- trust
agreement covering a carefully thought-out
plan and submit to him within a week. He
was stricken with his last illness within the
week, and was never able to consider the
matter further and died with all his care
fully laid plans come to naught. Don't pro
crastinate in this most important duty! It
means so much to those you leave behind.
Give this subject the same careful planning
and execution that you give your business.
Some day, suddenly, maybe always un
expectedly you will cross the bar. Be
sure the loved ones are safeguarded in what
you possess to leave them. Let us advise
with you on the subject, without obligation.
