The President’s Message.
The annual message of the President to
Congress is published on (lie inside of to
tliv’s paper. It is evidently the production
of Abraham Lincoln, and nobody else, and,
like all Ihe state papers which emanate from
him, cannot fail to be received with heart
felt approbation by the loyal portion of the
American people.
The position he arsmnes in regard lo the
rebellious Slates will lomm ml i.seif lo ’he
judgment of every meditative mind. He
does not recognize o> correct the doctrine of
lion. Charles Sunni-r and other statesmen, |
that the m ceded States have reduced them- !
selves to the condition of territories and can j
be restored to the Unitm only by new acts of j
admission from Congress, ilc announces as j
the proper course to pursue, to stand by the j
I coon men in the revolted Stales and assist I
them to re-organize their State governments |
in their ow n w ay, subject to National laws.
The Proclamation appended to .the Mes
sage is a most important, and, it scorns to us,
wise document. To the Scut hern masses i
who have committed treason against the gov- I
eminent, he oilers full pardon on their taking |
the oa‘h of allegiance which he prescribes.
It, will be seen ti-.it certain classes of leaders
receive no Midi offers of pardon, and. the p c- |
sumption is, that (hey must, sooner or later, !
■swing by the neck for their infamous crimes, j

"Woodward. of Pennsylvania, the late demo

lias given a judicial decision that the con

It surely was most lilting that he should be

We would direct the attention of our read
i ers to the advertisoiccnt, iu ar.o her column.

| Van Sceenwyk, preddent of the Batavian
Ba k, La Crosse, is agent for this seed n of
I the State, and of him Bonds may be ordered
| or had at ail times.
j The Philadelphia Xorth American gives
j the following excellent advice to ail who wish
| to invest money, and it is w-.il for ail who
J are in funds to hood its counsel;
Though money has been temporarily scarce,
: capital continues abundant; and the recent
| tumble in the stockmarkot lias brought cap
| italists to a realizing sense of the unreliable
. character of many of the S( eurities dealt in.
i It i- greatly to the credit of the Government
that its loans, of all the se urit - daily dealt
j in on the market, have maintained.their in
| tegrity of price better than almost anything
| else, its Five Twenty year six per cent, loan,
j the interest cu which is promptly paid in
j gold, has b en subscribed to all through the
: pressure in the money market, at an average
jof more than two mil Tons per day. And what
S is not the least gratifying fact iu connoc
-1 turn With the daily largo subscriptions to
| tiiis popuh r , >an, sc; re ;ly any of i: is return
ed i.i tire market for sale. It is taken for in
| vestment, and is held with unfaltering con-
I fiJence in its relh-.blitv. And whv should It not
be? It is g -eii that the Governmon* now, after
two years of the most gigantic war that the
world has evi r known, experiences no diffi
culty in commanding the necessary means M
prosecute it,or in paying regularly the interest
in gold ns it fails and ie. if this can be done
while the war is being waged, who cm antici
pate any difiiculty in readily accomplishum it
when the war shell be ended? What better
investment thou, for capital, than the ‘'Five
Twenty - ’ Government loan ? But if aav doubt,
let him r< f i to the statistics furnished by
the census table of various nations of the !
w rid. The facts which they present will
prove the . most satisfactory mode of dis- i
peJiing the numberless gloomy apprehensions j
which are being continually conjured up by
those who are disposed to exaggerate the ex- j
tent ot the calamity occasioned bv our rebel
lion. A reference to the suite of most of the
prosperous nations of the old world clearly
disproves such a position, and shows that the
highest conditions oi national advancement
have not been materially affected bj the ex
tended wars in which those nations have
bet u immemocially engaged, and that a heavy
national indebtedness has not proved an
unmitigated evil.
lor instance, Great Britain, Franco and the
Xe norlands will undoubtedly ba conceded '
to represent the highest prosperity that lias |
been attained by any ol lac Aurotiean nations, j
And yet no nations Jiave yet been called upon !
to endure fiercer or more prolonged w ars, do
mestic and foi Re, sh.o-, tiny. The effect
Ims been, utupiesrionably, to incur an enor
mous national indebtedness; but neither their
wars nor their indebtedness have had the
effect to destroy their elasticity, n< r to check
the progress of their general prosperity.—
The result w ould have been different, proba
bly. if those nations had been fallin. r into de
cay, instead of being, as they really were, in
a suit' of development; and in this respect
their case resembles our own. with enormous
auvan:ages rt our favor, rina-e nations, while
undergoing toe trials of war, were opp- s ,-cd
by the eviis of an immense exodus of their
people, caused by the density iff their popu
lation, the impossibility to provide occupation 1
for them, the low p: iee for labor, an i ih'j
scarcity of tomtom. Compared with onr own |
country, they possessed slight room for future !
ci velopiiieni; they wi re settled in everv
pa !, a id no vast territory lay Invi ugly open
io encimiMenterprise and Settlement, —
Their great problem has over been what to do
with their surplus population, which, in its
turn, has sought new fields for adventure and
seif support in countries like onr ow n. where
an illimitable territory waits to b '■ developed,
and where incalculable resources invite in
dustry a.id energy, flic encouragmr.ent to bo
derived from these Tads and comparisons
of circumstances ’s very groat, and to the
:• ind of any d.i.- )i ss 5 ma; e i cas uer is conclu

that the Secretary of the Treasury lias ample
and i nfaili g resources in tiie Duti s on Im
parts and Internal Revcuu s, arid in
| sue of the Interest bearing Legal Tender
| Notes, it is almost a certainty that he wi.l
I not find it necessary, for a long time to come,
• to seek a market for any other long or per-
I inanent Loans, the Interest anp Rrixcii’al
i OF WHICH ARE FaVATILE IX GOLD.
Prudence an I self-interest muA force the
minds ot those the formation
I of National Bunking Associations, as well as
the minds ot all who have idle money on their
hands, to the prompt conclusion that they
should lose no. time in su svi.t_>in° to this
most popular Loan. It will soon bo" b.vond
their reach, and advance to a handsome pre
mium, as was the result with the “Haven
Thirty” Loin, when it was all sold and could j
no longer be subscribed for,at par.
It i* a Six per Cent. Loan, the Interest and,
Principal payable in Coin , Ih>‘ i yielding e>, ,-I
Xineper Cent.per n at the present rate
of premium on coin.
The Government requires all duties on im- |
ports to be paid in Coin; these duties have
for a long time past amounted to over a Quar
ter ot a billion ot Dollars daily', a sum near
ly three limes greater than that required in
the payment of the interest on all the 5-20’s!
and other permanent Loans. . So tb.,t it is !
hoped that the surplus Coin in the Treasury,
at no distant day, will enable the United
States to resume specie payments upon ail
liabilities.
The Loan is called 5-20 from the fact that
whilst the Bonds may run fer 20 years, "vet
Hi Govern t has a pay' them off
in Gold at par, at any time after 5 years,
Tm: J.riEiiF.sT is paid half-yearly, viz: on
the first days of November and May.
Subscribers can have Coupon Bonds, which
are payable to bearer, and are 850, §IOO.
§SOO, and Blouo ■ or Registered Bonds oi
same denominations, and iu addition, 8-5,00
and *IO,OOO. For Ranking purposes and for
invt -inicnts of Trust-monies, the Registered
Bonds are preferable.
Tli -sc 5-20’s cannot bo taxed by States,
cities, towns or cm utics, and the Government
tilX <u tl'Olil is oiliy Oiio-ariil fi-lialt’ per cent.
on the uiaoiuit of ineoiuc, when the income
of the holder exceeds Six Hundred dollars
per annum; all other investments, such as
income from Mortgages, Railroad Stock and
Bonds, etc., must pay from three to live per
cent, tax on the income.
Banks and Bankers throughout the Coun
try will continue to dispose of the Bonds;
and all orders by mail, or otherwise, prompt
ly attended to.
The inconvenience of a f vv day s’ dchw in
the delivery of the Bonds is unavoidable, the :
demand being so great; but as interns, com
mences from the day of subscription, no loss
is ■ ccasi ned, ind every effort is being made
to diminish the deiav,
