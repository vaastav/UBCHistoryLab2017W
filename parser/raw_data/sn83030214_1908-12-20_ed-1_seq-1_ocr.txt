NEW. POST FOR MAGOON?
Believed That He Will Be Governor
General of Philippines.
[From Tho Tribune Bureau.]
"Washington, Dec. 19.— 1t Is regarded In inner
circles In Washington as practically settled that
Judge Charles E. Maroon, now Provisional Gov
ernor of Cuba, -will be requested by the Presi
dent-elect to accept the office of Governor Gen
eral of the Philippines. Governor Ma goon's
present tour of duty ■will end with the inaugura
tion of President Gomez, on February 28, and he
will come north immediately. He hag now been
practically four years a resident of the tropics,
having been Governor of Panama before going
to Cuba, and he has filled both positions -w ith
exceptional ability. For this reason he is re-
K;ir<l.-.1 as likely to make an exceptional success
in the position of Governor General of the Phil
ippines, and Mr. Taffs deep and abiding in
terest in the Islands -will insure the selection
for ihat important office of a man with special
qualifications and attainments.
It is regarded as probable that Judge M:ig«'»on
will be permitted to take a considerable r^st
before ( nteiing upon the duties of his new post,
and it is not improbable that he will be sent on
some foreign mission In Xorthecii latitudes i>^
for<* going- again to the tropics.
The present Governor General of the Philip
pine?, Judge Smith, is anxious to receive an ap
pointment to the federal bench In this country,
and it is assumed that he will be nominated for
6urh office by the future President whenever
Judge Jbgnon is prepared to relieve him.
Judge Magoon has been frequently mentioned
for the portfolio of "War in President Taft's
Cabinet, and that he may ultimately attain that
position is regarded as not at aJI imprubable.
The present Indications are. however, that Sec
retary "Wright will remain in the Cabinet for a
time, perhaps throughout Judge Magoon's ex
pected incumbency as Governor General of the
Philippines.
The friends of George yon 1.. Meyer, now
Postmaster General, believe that he will suc
ceed Mr. Xewberry as Secretary of the Navy,
and it is freely intimated that sooner or later
William Loeb, jr., secretary to the President,
will be offered the portfolio of Commerce and
Labor.
MASQUERADED AS MAN.
Strange Adventures of Girl Ac
cused of Robbing Own Room.
Cedar Rapids, lowa, Dec. 3C». — A young wom
an, masquerading as a man. and telling a
strange story of adventures, with which a mur^
der commitgsd two yeara ago in Philadelphia
may be connected, was arrested here I
under the name of Earl Waters.
The authorities arrested "Waters" "for rob
\ itiet ■'his'" own room and filing a complaint
the police Then they discovered "Waters"
to be a girl, apparently about eighteen years
old. She says she doea not know her own
name, unless It Is "Pearl "Waters." She says
she was born in Europe, and that her earliest
recollections are of life in New York. A woman
with whom she lived was abusive, and four
yean ag-o tho sir! do:;ned a boy's suit and left
her.
At Philadelphia she 'ell in with a youns man,
1 .oi lining his companion, though she did not
reveal her sex. She says he became involved in
a quarrel, committed murder and that they fled.
They came to Cedar Rapids two years ago,
since which time both have been employed as
newsboys on trains.
Philadelphia, Dec. 19.— The Philadelphia police
havo no record of "Earl Waters," who was ar
r^sted in Cc-Tlar Rapids. lowa, to-day. Several
unsolved murder mysteries confront the Phil
ia police, notably that of Dr. Wilson, who
waa killed by drinking a bottle of poisoned ale
which was pent him by express. Superintendent
Taylor, however, pays that the woman arrested
at fedar Rapids could not have been Involved
in that murder.

BROKER SHOT IN OFFICE
INVENTOR, AFTER MONET,
FIRES AT 11. B. SUYD AM.
Vproar on Curb, and Prisoner, Who
Pleads Self -Dc fence, Is Threat
ened — Victim Mmy Die.
Harry B. Suydam, a curb broker, with ar of
fice at Xo. SS Broad street and living at No 141
Clinton avenue, PlalnfieUl, X. J. was shot It h!3
I office yesterday morning by John C. Lumnlen,
a Southern Inventor, who says Suydam and
others defrauded him out of his life's -work.
Mr. Buydain was taken to the Hudson Paioct
; Hospital, where it was said last night there was
I little hope for his recovery. Not in many months
has there been so much excitement In the finan
cial district as that caused yesterday by the
f shooting, and Lumsden would have fared badly
I at tha hands of the infuriated curb brokers had
it not been for the prompt arrival of the re
serves of the John street station under the com
mand'uf Captain Hogan.
It was shortly after the opening of the .-
Exchange that Lumsden appeared at Mr. Suy
dam's office, telling the doorman that he wasted
towee Mr. Saydam himself^ and that if be was
not In he would wait for him. The office f wee
paid little attention to him, as he had been in th.'
office before aud was known to a!l of them by
sight. A few minutes after Lumsden's arrival
Mr. Suydam appeared, and after greeting Ma
employes turned to Lumsden with a hearty
"Good morning. Take off your coat."
Lumsdsn, according to the employe?;, took off
his overcoat and laid it on a table, say
Mr. Suydam at the" same tim^:
"I don't want to sit down, but I do wani to see
you in private."
SUYDAM CRIES FOR HELP.
Mr. Suydam walked to the window and I.v Ba
den followed him. The two stood in sight of |
those in the adjoining offices and street qnd j
talked together for several minutes, no one pay
ing any especial attention to them. Sudd> uly -
Mr. Sirydam swung around and snouted to
George A. Downs, a clerk in the office:
"For God's sake, George, tako this man away I
or ho will kill me."
Downs jumped to his feet and ran toward the
window where the two men stood glaring at
each other, but Lumsden was too quick for him. i
Drawing a revolver from hfrs pocket Lums leu
fired two shots at close range. In a moment I
the office and that part of Broad street in front
of the building was in an uproar, for the shots
could bo heard plainly in the street. Downs
hurled Lumsden against the wall and prevented
him from using tlto weapon again, while others ;
in the office ran for help. Patrolmen John J. |
Corcoran and Beaton were the first to reach i
the room, and there they found Downs holding
on to his prisoner, while hundreds of the ten
anta of the building were collecting in front of i
the office, fighting to %*t in. Mr. Suydam was
staggering toward a window, gasping for .ilr.
One shot had tak> n effect near his heart, while 1
the other pierced the right lung and upper lobe 1
of the liver.
Corcoran and Beaton, realizing the serious
ness of the case, sent in a hurry call for an
ambulance from the Hudson Street Hospital
and another for th© police reserves. Because of
the excitement it was almost impossible for the
police to learn who did the shooting until Mr.
Suydam rallied enough to point to Lumsden
and cry:
"That man shot me for a reason I do not
know!"
Shortly after making this statement he be
came exhausted and lapsed Into unconscious
ness.
CROWD THREATENS PRISONER.
After the arrival of the ambulance it was
some time before the police attempted to take
the prisoner to the station house. The crowd
in front of t'.ie building had grown to groat
proportions, and many threats of violence were
hurled at the prisoner. All ports of rumors
were afloat regarding the shooting, and little
business was transacted for a time. With the
arrival of the reserves police lines were formed
from the office to the street, and the prisoner,
calm and collected, was # placed in the patrol
wagon and hurried to the station house, wit] a
crowd chasing the wagon.
At the station bouse Lumsden gave 1.
as thirty-one years, and said be lived at No.
i>l3 West 57th street. .He showed little emo
tion. He asked for a. drink of water, and when
tills was given to him he turned to Captain
Hogan and made the following statement:
"Suydam owed me $650, and has owed it foi ;t
long time, ami 1 needed the money. He gave me
notes for money which he had raised on col
lateral which 1 had given him. The collati a)
was stock in a concern to manufacture an el< c

this morning went down with the expectation of
getting it. 1 waa told to wait until aft.T the
market had opened, and 1 sat down. Then three
iu< !i Jumped on an , nun I picked up a
from somewhere and shot."
While Lumsden was talking to Captain Hogan
Downs, who was greatly attached to liis cin
r, could scarcely contain his emotioi
turning to Lieutenant Kenny he remarked:
"It's a good thing for that man that he is
under the protection of the p
SUYDAM MAKES STATEMENT.
Mr Suydam, \> ho exhibited great nerve. ir.;< le

be said:

TASK STAGGERS SENATE
REBUKING OF PRESIDENT
HAZARDOUS.
Leading Senators Not If 'tiling to
Undertake Work — Cou ntry
Supporting Mr. Roosevelt.
[From The Tribune Bureau]
'Washington, Dec. 19— That rebuking the
President, or even conducting an Investigation
of that portion of the administration devoted to
the prosecution of violations of the federal
statutes. Is a particularly hazardous undertak
ing, and one which few legislators care to
undertake, is becoming daily more obvious to
the Senate leaders. It is appreciated that un
less the Intended Investigation is conducted by
men of character It will be without force or ef
fect, while experience Is daily demonstrating
that practically no such Senator is anxious to
undertake the work. Correspondence is coming
to Senators in large volume, the tenor of which
adds emphasis to the dangerous character of
the proposed action.
Senator Hale maintains that as chairman of
i the Committee on Naval Affairs and acting
chairman Of the Committee on Appropriations,
he is too heavily burdened to assume the chair
manship of the sub-committee to which he would
delegate the proposed investigation. Senator
Cullom is hardly strong enough to do much
extra work, and he is now in charge of the
sub-committee which is considering and must
i soon report the legislative, executive and judicial
appropriation bill. Senator GalUnger has a
' fight for re-election on his hands, and has al
i ready left here for his state to rally Ins politi
! cal forces. This leaves, among the Republican
| members Of the Committee on Appropriations,
only Senators Perkins, . Elkins, Warren and
Hemenway. It seems probable that Messrs.
Warren and Hemenway will bo drafted, but
Messrs. Perkins and Elkins are n-»t regarded as
1 especially suitable material for an investigation
I committee: Mr. Hemenway is n<-aring the end
of his term, and as the Indiana Legislature will
i be Democratic, he has no political life to risk,
but Mr. Warren is regarded by many as too
friendly to the administration t" bring in the
sort of report they would iike. Altogether, the
situation is the occasion of perplexity and
anxiety to the Senate leaders.
'l*here seems to be little doubt that Senator
Teller, as ranking Demociat, will be chosen, and
it is possible that Senator Tillman, the next
ranking member, will be the other Democrat, but
some of the Republicans object to serving with
Mr. Tillman because of his eccentricities of
method and speech. Most of the members of the
Senate would be entirely satisfied to intrust to
Mr. Teller the conduct of the entire investiga
tion, but. of course party pride would make that
impossible.
That the country is rot in sympathy with the
attitude of Congress toward the President's
message is evident from the letters Senators are
receiving. For instance, one Senator received
to-day a letter which read In part:
"Nothing could help an honest Senator more
than now to demonstrate his integrity in pro
tecting popular rights and public property by
standing by the President. No explanation will
serve as an e*cuse for any attack upon that
great and sincere cham't|ua of the people Any
thing else they will cou. t as secret hostility to
their interests."
Another Senator has received a letter from a
constituent, which is, in part, as follows:
"I can assure you that I am by nn means the
only one of your constituents In this state who
will resent as nn indignity which can only be-
Uttle the standing of the Senate any official
criticism concerning a rebuke so justly deserved
and so fearlessly expressed."
Many hundreds of similar communications
are reaching Senators every' day, and one pajnm-
Inent leader said, sadly, this afternoon, that If
this kind of "popular shower" kept up there
would bo "nobody left on Appropriations except
'Jim' Hemenway and 'Steve' Elkins who will
dare und rUtke the Investigation."
SECRET SERVICE STAND INDORSED.
Ban Francisco, nn p c. 19.— The executivo comatittes
of the Good Government League of this city has
sent the following tHp.£rr;im to President IJnosevelt:
"The executive committee of the Good Govern
ment I.PHjrue heartily immrsi-s your positive Ftand
regarding Secret Service as outlined In your recent
message to Congress."
CRUISERS ASSIGNED TO MR. TAFT.

BOY HERO GUARDS BABY
Tries in Vain to Protect Infant
Brother from Flames.
Three small children were badly burned In a
flre which destroyed the tenement house at No.
2093 Atlantic avenue, Brooklyn, yesterday. The
youngest, a sfx-months-old baby, now in St.
Mary's Hospital, is not expected to live. The
building burned rapidly and the firemen had to
wage a desperate battle. The burned children
were named Jackson.

married Divorced Men.
St. Louis, Dec. lfl.— A decision that a divorced
woman may seize her former husband's earnings
and property to enforce the' payment of ali
mony, even though he haa married again, was

TO AID CUPIDS WORK.
Bachelor Tax Bill Provides for State
Bureau for the Bashful.
[By Telegraph to Th© Tribune.!
Milwaukee, Dec. 19.— Assemblyman John J.
Farrell is at work on a bill to make bachelor*
marry after they reach the age of thirty, or pay
a penalty for each year's delay. How to pro
vide sufficient punishment for bachelors is the
stumbling block. This much is decided:
He will make marrlagre easy for the bashful
and unacquainted. He will provide for the es
tablishment of a state matrimonial bureau, at
which persons desiring to avoid the tax and re
quiring aid may register. From this list the
bashful man may pick out a lonely girl— and the
fee will maintain the bureau.
' In the opinion of Assemblyman Farrell, some
bachelors simply lack the nerve to ask a woman
to m-axry. This nerve will be supplied through
his measure, he thinks.
It is, perhaps, unnecessary to add that Mr.
Farrell is a married man.
