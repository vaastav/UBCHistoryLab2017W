IIICHIQAN HATTERS.
For the Protection of Gam.
During the session just passed two deer
hunters, who went to Muuising from the
lower part of the state, killed deer
Within ninety days. The saddles, which
are worth on the average, $" each, were
shipped out of the state. The hunters
aubtdtted almost entirely on the meat they
killed and their only outlay was for am
munition. Their net protlt was therefore
nearly $1,400. Other pot hunters at other
points have done the same, and in conse
quence ganio i' the Upper lVninsula of
Michigan in growing scarce. There is a
law to prevent shipping deer out of the
state, but it is not enforced. There is also
a law to restrain hunters from killing deer
in thrt water with light, but it also is
practically inoperative.
ISo great has been the slaughter of deer
in the only parts of the state where they
oxist in any numbers that the leg
islature will bo asked this winter
to enact, still more stringent laws,
which will be enforced by th local sports
men's and game associations which have
lccn formed recently in nearly nil the cit
ies in this pnrt of the ft ate. The statute
asked lor will be to prevent the shipment
of game out of the upper nciiiusiihi. Tho
proent law prohibit ing t ho shipment of
deer out of th" state can be easily evaded.
It is verv easv to ship a deer to some point
in the state near the Ohio line, then reship
it to uny part of the country desiivd.
Wholesale slaughter in tho herds uf deer
that roam through parts of the upper pe
ninsula has been no greater than the havoc
ma le among the tinny resident of the
small rivers and creel:.." P.rook trout have
been taken with nets and shipped away
by the ton. Unless a stop is put to this the
hunting and fishing grounds of the upper
peninsula will soon exist only iu the lucia- j
ory or tuo pat.
