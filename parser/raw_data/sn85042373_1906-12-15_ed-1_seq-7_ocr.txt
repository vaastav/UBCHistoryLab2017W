The Red River
of the North-
F. I. Whitley, former passenger traf
fic manager of the Great Northern rail
way, when asked for a paragraph or
two on the Red River country, respond
ed in terms indicating that the busy and
practical man of affairs often has a
poetic, terse and interesting style in
expressing himself, as witness the fol'
lowing:
"It is not as wide as the Amazon,
as deep in its bed as the Colorado, as
shallow as the Platte, as long as the
Mississippi, as clear as the Uraguay, as
muddy as the Missouri, as mighty as
the Niagara, as broken with islands as
the St. Lawrence, as picturesque as
the St. Louis, nor historic like the
Hudson and the Rhine, not romantic
like the Merrimac and the Mohaw, not
told in song liek Swanee and Dan
ube, not battle strained like the Iser
and the Tiber, not fed with mountain
snows like the Columbia and the
Kootenai, nor lined with a dense popu
lation like the Thames and Seine
not favored with government aid as
liberally as the Tombigbee and Noxu
bee—yet the Red River of the North
cuts somewhat of a figure in the west
ern hemisphere.
"It is a placid stream as a rule and
knows its own business. It is nearly
500 miles long it is navigable for quite
two thirds of its length it rune north
ward a greater distance than any other
stream on earth, except the Nile, of
which it is the prototype in fertile be
longings it forms the boundary line
between Minnesota and North Dakota.
It has a sky as blue as that over
Italy, as bright with stars at night aB
that over Chaldean plains .which gave
birth to astronomy it has a summer
air that never depresses a winter air
that invigorates but never chills or
gives a man the shivers it never has
the long spells of miserable muddy
roads common in the eastern and
southern states.
It is noted as running through the
finest wheat producing country in the
globe it has the conditions of making
butter and cheese and raising poultry
it has no stony ground to provoke the
wrath of the farmer the plowshare
cuts the sod as the swift yacht cleaves
the water it has to the east the largest
force of pine in the country, and mines
of iron and copper it has to the west
the natural domain and home of the
sheep raiser and wool producer, of the
horse and cattle raiser and still be
yond the mountains with mines of
Alaska and the Orient it has to the
north a mighty empire of land and
vast possibilities it has to the south
no competition in the production of
man's best food, grain.
"It has a newspaper press worthy
of its greatness it has schools, church
and market facilities it has more
banks than some of the jtlder states ot
the union it has a people enjoying
larger percapita income than the popu
lation of any equal agricultural area
in the world, and yet the valley is not
half ocupied it has the main line and
various branches of the Great Northern
railway, affording transportation fa
cilities it makes the Great Northern
the largest caterer of wheat from orig
inal points fany railroad in exist
ence, and fin-ally, let me say, that the
Red River Valley is all right. And—
North Dakota—well, she's all right, too.
The records of the scale beam, the
overflowing elevator bins and the bal
ance on the right side of the bank led
gers all show remarkable growth and
prosperity."
Perhaps it is the intention to add
Poultney Bigelow's remarks to that
illustrated canal message as sort
of comic supplement.
Judge Grosscup's declaration that
the^ Roosevelt message is a crazy-quilt
indicates that the remarks on judicial
decisions must have hit the judicial
crazy-bone.
Commissioner Garfield points to the
abandonment of rebates following his
oil report as an evidence of the value
of publicity. No doubt, but how about
the value of prospective prosecution?

SIX YEARSFOR HOOE
Negro Coachman, Prominent
in Hartje Divorce Trial,
Given Long Rest.
Pittsburg, Pa., Dec, 15.—Clifford
Hooe, the negro coachman convicted
for perjury in connection with a de
position made by him before the
Hartje divorce trial, was refused a
new trial and sentenced by Judge
Robert S. Fraser to pay a fine of $50
and the costs of the court trial, and
to imprisonment of six years in the
western penitentiary of Pennsylvania.
Almost immediately after the sen
tence was imposed Hooe was taken
to the penitentiary.
Attorney J. Welford Holmes, one of
Hooe's counsel, said that an appeal
would be taken.
Attorneys for Augustus Hartje will
at once take up the matter of an
appeal to the superior court, which
meets here in April, from the decisior
handed down by Judge Fraser yes
terday in which a divorce was refused
Hartje. The appeal will be based on
the fact that the letters which figured
in the suit were not proved forgeries.
FIRST XMAS TREE.
The first Christmas tree in the
United States, it is claimed was in
troduced in the college town of Woos
ter, O. August Imgard was the pro
moter and he brought the idea from
his former home in Germany. For
more than half a century Mr. Imgard
has been familiarly known among a
large circle of people as the father of
the Christmas tree. He died not long
ago at the age ot° 80, after having
lived in Wooster for more than 00
years.
Few young peopie of the present
day realize that the Christmas tree is
of comparatively recent origin in this
country. In the early days of Amer
ica there was a strong aversion to the
observance of Christmas after the
manner in which it was celebrated in
Europe, or in fact any observance of
it at all. It is even claimed that the
New England Thanksgiving was es
tablished as a substitute for the
growing tendency to observe Christ
mas. All Yuietide festivals were
therefore slow in making their ap
pearance in the United States, but the
Christmas tree came last of all. In
Europe the Christmas tree was first
established in Rome, and from there
introduced into Germany, where it
soon became popular.
If all the subjects of the president's
message
are referred to appropriate
committees the document may earn
popularity in congress by necessitating
several new chairmanships and clerk
ships.
