Of Right d Ui Justice New
Mexico Should II -astute.
Cannibalism is another crime that
the Americans have to deal with in the
Philippine Islands. And yet there are
people at Boston and Lincoln, Neb.,
who want to give these dear little can
nibals complete independence so that
they may pursue undisturbed their
customs and practices.
The Guadalupe county bank with
capital stock of $30,000, located at Santa
Rosa, Guadalupe county, has been in
corporated under the territorial laws
and has commenced business. Another
instance of how the territorial adminis
tration is keeping capital and invest
ments out of the territory.
Yung Lu, the real author of the Box
er rebellion and outrages, has been re
warded by the Chinese court, with a
two-eyed peacock feather ''for having
protected foreigners against the Box
ers." Chinese sarcasm and child-like
blandness still beat anything of their
kind in any other part of the world.
The Denver Post publishes quite a
lengthy interview with some fellow
that calls himself Weston that is chuck
full of lies, misrepresentations, mis
statements and fake stories. Publish
ing that sort of rot is not calculated to
make the state of Colorado friends in
New Mexico. The management of the
Denver Post should have known bet
ter. Of course, the Democrats found
something to criticise in the Hay
Pauncefote treaty. It suits the Repub
lican side of the senate however.- If all
treaties and legislation would be ar
ranged to suit the Democrats, whose
main business in congress is to object
to everything favored by the Republi
cans, this republic would soon be on its
downward road.
The construction of the Dawson rail
road from Tucumcari, on the Chicago,
Rock Island and Pacific, to the Daw
son coal fields in Colfax county, will in
the next eight months add 150 miles to
the present railroad mileage in the ter-
rltory. Despite the assertions of the
yellow sheets and soreheads of New
Mexico that capital is being driven out
of the territory, the building of new
railroads keeps on steadily.
The Denver Post, in a recent number
published a rather readable article on
the political situation of New Mexico.
The article contained a story on the
political fight now on between Govern
or Otero and Thomas B. Catron, and
as said above, was right readable, al
though it contained scarcely a correct
or true statement. This goes to show
that readable articles can be written
without resorting to truth or facts in
the case.
There Is complaint of rowdyism In
the railroad construction camps in Lin
coln county. That is not strange how
ever, and the law officers of that part
of New Mexico succeed fairly well In
maintaining law and order under ad
verse circumstances. As soon as the
railroad is finshed, the rougher and
more disorderly men employed in the
.construction work will leave the ter
ritory and peace and morality will hold
sway along the new railroad.
The city of Las Vegas having no fear
of the consequences that might or
might not ensue, Is an applicant for
the location of the military post. The
board of trade has filed a formal appli
cation in this respect with the board of
general officers appointed to recom
mend sites for new military posts. In
addition the towns of Clayton, in Union
county, and Gallup, in McKinley coun
ty, are applicants. It seems when there
Is a good thing around everybody
wants It.
Chief Justice W. J. Mills and Asso
ciate Justices John R. McFie and
Frank W. Parker have been reappoin
ted to the positions that they have filled
to the satisfaction of all concerned dur
ing the past four years. The people of
New Mexico are greatly gratified at
this action of President Roosevelt and
approve of It highly. The New Mexi
can has supported the three judges'
names for reappointment believing
that they fully deserved It, and Is con
sequently well pleased with the result.
The agrarian fight over a proposed
tariff to protect agricultural products
which Is becoming so bitter in Ger
many, Is being extended to Ireland and
threatens to split the Irish voters Into
still more factions. An Irish labor or
ganization recently adopted a resolu
tion asking "respectfully that Its pres
idents. Maude Gonne and Major Mc-
Brlde, petition the American people,
for Almighty God's sake, to save the
Irish laborer and worklngmen from
extermination by the greedy, selfish,
purse-proud framers and the United
Irish League." The people In America,
although they draw partisan lines very
sharply, have scarcely any Idea of the
bitterness engendered In Germany, Ire
land and other countries by political
and oonornlcal quMtln.
The appointment of ex-Sheriff Pat
rick F. Garrett of Las Cruces, Dona
Ana county, to be collector of the port
of El Paso, will be very acceptable to
the people o the district, New Mexico
being the greater portion of El Paso's
collection district. The New Mexican
was of the opinion and-so said in its
editorial columns that the appointment
should go to a New Mexico Republi
can. There is every reason to believe
The world thought that the meas
ures ndnnted hv the British in South
Africa to suppress ths Boers are as
harsh as civilization can countenance,
but tidings come from Great Britain
that they will be made still harsher.
Great Britain has succeeded in creat
ine; another bleeding Cuba in South
Africa, but there is no nation like thej
United States near enough to put aj
stop to the bloodshed, reconcentration 1
methods and cruelty and besides, If
there were, Great Britain is stronger
and more tenacious than Spain and
could not so easily be conquered.
Alamogordo is looking for an addi
tional water supply. The town is grow
ing so fast that the present fine system
of water supply will soon be inade
quate, tl is likely that a pipe line will
be laid in Alamo canon a few miles
further up the mountains than the pre
sent pipe line. An effort will be made
to increase the flow of water in La Luz
canon. The El Paso and Northeastern
Railway company will In addition bore
test wells as there is a likelihood that
artesian water will be struck some
where in the vicinity of Alamogordo.
The Magic City of the Sacramentoes
will not let anything stand in its way
of future growth and prosperity.
Senator Wellington finds himself to
be a nondescript whom neither party
desires to have in its ranks. The Re
publicans of the senate have notified
the Democrats that they must take
care of the Maryland senator, and the
Democrats have positively refused to
do so. Senator McLaurin of South
Carolina, is almost in the same boat
although the Republicans are disposed
to be more friendly to him than are the
Democrats to Wellington. It is a pity
that so bright a man as Wellington
who had a chance to make Maryland
permanently a Republican state and
thereby gain fame and prestige for
himself, should throw all his chances
to the wind simply to gratify a mean
personal spite.
The big railroad systems in order to
prevent rate cutting by the weaker
lines, have consented to run their fast
trains slower between Chicago and
western points. The minimum time be
tween Denver and Omaha has been
placed at 13 hours and 30 minutes, al
though the Burlington and Rock Is
land had Intended to reduce it to twelve
hours, and the time between St. Paul
and Denver dare not be less than 12
hours and 55 minutes. In this case, it
seems that the community of interests
of railroads authorizes a step back
ward which will' h.-rVdly meet tho ap
proval of the traveling public which, on
account of the great and expensive lm
provements made lately by several of
the transcontinental lines, expected to
see the time between coast and coast
cut down considerably. But even the
community of interests of the railroads
will not be able to stop progress for any
length of time.
More Reasons for Statehood.
The Rocky Mountain News gives the
following good reasons, a few of many,
why New Mexico, Arizona and Okla
homa should be admitted to state
hood:
"Strong pressure Is being brought to
bear on congress for the admission of
New Mexico, Arizona and Oklahoma
into the union. The demand of these
territories for statehood is favored by
the western press with practical unan
imity. No satisfactory reason can be
urged why they should not be admit
ted. On the other hand, the reasons
urged for their admission are unan
swerable. According to the census of
1900, New Mexico had a population of
194,000, Arizona of 122,000, and Oklaho
ma of 398,000. Very many states were
admitted with much less population;
not a few states now have less. Since
the census was taken all three territor
ies have increased largely In popula
tion. "In all other respects these territories
are fitted for statehood. Their Indus
tries are varied and their development
will be given a marked Impetus by be
ing created into states. They have
well established school systems, and
their people are enterprising, Intelli
gent and patriotic. They are amply
able to sustain state governments and
are anxious for the time to come when
they shall be permitted to govern
themselves. Every consideration of
fairness and justice entitles them to
the favorable action of congress.
"There is a historic reason why they
should be admitted to the union by
this congress. The centennial of the
Louisiana purchase will be celebrated
in 1903. If the Indian Territory and
Oklahoma are united and admitted as
a single state (Its population would be
900,000) the entire area purchased by
Jefferson would have been carved Into
states. The Louisiana purchase paved
the way for the Mexican acquisition of
which New Mexico and Arizona con
stltute the only portions not carved
Into states. Under the treaty of Guad
alupe Hidalgo, signed In 1848, they are
entitled to become states. The "adding
of three stars to the national flag In
1903 would be a most appropriate rec
ognition of a great anniversary, and
significant In the fact that all the ter
ritories -within the confines of the Uni
ted States proper had been erected Into
states. It would mean that just a cen
tury from the time that the United
States first acquired any territory west
of the Mississippi the entire region be
tween the great river and the Pacific
had so progressed In population, In
dustrial development, commerce, trans
portation, education and all the arts of
civilized life that It had been added to
the American union."

EX-GOVERNOR L. B. PRINCE
AT WASHINGTON.
He Is Working Hard to Have an Army
Post Located at Santa Fe.
Washington Post.
Hon. L. Bradford Prince, ex-chief jus
tice and ex-governor of New Mexico, Is
at the Ebbitt House, to present to the
army board on military posts the claims
of Santa Fe. Gov. Prince Is well known
in the east from his long service in the
New York legislature, where, as far
back as 1872, he had charge of the pro
secution of Judge Barnard, Cardozo,
and McCrum, In the reform from the
Tweed regime. It will also bo remem
bered that his name was associated with
that of the father of the President in the
memorablo fight between President
Hayes and Senator Conk ing, when the
President nominated itooseveit ana
Prince as collector and naval officer of
New York, in place of Gen. Arthur and
Gov. Cornell.
In talking of the army post matter,
he said: "Santa Fe is the most historic
army post in the country, having been
established In 1598, before Jamestown
and Plymouth were thought of, and
always kept there on account of the re
markable climate, in which no soldier
can die or provisions spoil. The old re
servation there is a beautiful spot In the
center ot the city, and, in addition, tne
local authorities offof any amount of
land that may be desired."
Gov. Prince Is also chairman ot tne
legislative committeo of the Trans
Mississiopl Congress, which will soon
open headquarters in Washington and
advocate some of the Western measures
recommended by that congress. The
other members are H. E. Whltroore,
Missouri: Robert Graham, Colorado; W.
M Bunker, California, and J. M. Cole
man, Texas.
Lincoln County on the Highroad to
Prosperity.
Capitan Progress.
It is conceded by everyone who has
been a close observer of the events of
the past few months that Lincoln coun
ty is on the verge of an era of unpre
cedented development. Every Indus
try in the county shows greater activ
ity than at any time in the history of
the county. Especially Is this true of
the mining industry. Within the past
year more has been done towards de
veloping the mineral wealth of the
county than in all of the previous his
tory of the county. For years the min
ing industry has been at a standstill,
but now new life is being Infused Into
it by the application of capital which Is
finding its way into this section. Many
valuable prospects which have lain Idle
for years are being worked and made
to produce, while the entire country Is
being prospected with the most satis
factory results. There are men in the
country who are spending a great deal
of money purchasing mining property
and in many instances the prices paid
for single mining claims have reached
up into the thousands of dollars all of
which goes to show that the country Is
on the upward turn.
Concerning a National Lease Law.
Pecos Valley Stockman.
If the advoctaes of a lease law ever
succeed in convincing a majority of
the people of this country that this Is
the solution of the public land trou
bles, they must first present a bill that
Is practicable. While there has been
lota of talk on the question, thus far no
practicable bill has been presented to
the country for consideration, and the
people must be allowed to consider It
and understand the proposition before
it can be put through congress. Con
gress will not for a moment consider
any bill that has not the endorsement
of a great majority of the people, both
east and west. Thus far. the leasing
advocates have only presented the ab
stract theory. The people want to see
the definite and specific plan. Then
they will be able to make up their
minds whether leasing Is a grab game
or not.
New Mexico's Climate.
Raton Range.
There is good reason for the fact that
New Mexico's climate Is becoming far
famed. This happy land Is probably
blessed with more days of sunshine
during the year than any other habi
table portion of the globe. The tem
perature is remarkably mild and uni
form. There is very little moisture In
the air, so that the heat of summer Is
not so oppressive and the cold of 'win
ter not so penetrating as in less fav
ored lands. The atmosphere Is at all
times possessed of tonlo qualities which

Weston Is a Liar by the Card.
Albuquerque Citizen.
An alleged lawyer named Weston has
published a stereotyped batch of lies in
the Denver Post regarding New Mexi
co. He rather leads other defamers of
the territory, there not being a single
grain of truth In his whole batch of
falsehoods.

It is nothing new these days to hear

the fact that capital Is looking to New
