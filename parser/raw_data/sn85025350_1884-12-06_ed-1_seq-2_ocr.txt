MINING JOURNAL.
FROSTBURG, MARYLAND.
Saturday Morning, l>ec. G, IHH4.
With more of sorrow than anger
we observe a coolness has sprung up
between our Cumberland daily
brethren—a frigidity which amounts
on one side to a confession of real
“surprise.” To get the temperature
back to a normal average we suggest
that the hose of editorial opinion be
turned upon themes more conserva
tive than bribery allegations and al
legators.
A qintlehan away up in Maine
wants to furnish the Journal with
special articles under the heading of
“Scientific Miscellany” for a consid
eration. We are glad he has done
this good thing, but really regret we
cannot philosophically accept so long
as the question whether the civil ser
vice and tenure-of-office laws shall or
shall not be repealed. The Jour
nal is a solid paper, not much taken
up with those computations which
show how long it would take the sun
to dry up the earth, except so far as
evaporation may affect the Cheapeake
and Ohio canal and the Frostburg
Waterworks. It prefers to smile at
the deep, far-reaching stratagems of
the prohibitionists rather than at sub
divisions of the electric light; or
laugh at the rosy effrontery blooming
perennially upon B. F. Butler’s
cheek than at an artificial aurora
borealis.
Thb participle, “raising,” is used
in many connections, sacred and pro
fane. “Raising wheat,” “raising
bread,” “raising a blockade,” “raising
a house,” “raising the wind,” and
“raising children,” are common
idioms, the last named incorrectly for
rearing. There is also a process de
nominated “raising the dickins,” an
inferior hyperbole descriptive of cer
tain exaltations of the orthodox place
of everlasting punishment. But the
latest and worst use of this obedient
participle is contained in the follow
ing paragraph of the President’s
message: -
All treaties in the line of this policy
which have been negotiated or are in
process of negotiation contain a pro
vision deemed to be requisite under
the clause of the Constitution limiting
to the House of Representatives the
authority to originate bills for raising
revenge.
It goes without saying that the
Constitution is innocent of imposing
the restriction referred to, and the
President guiltless of such an unhap
py statement of perhaps the most im
portant power vested in the House of
Representatives. We cannot speak
so confidently of the blamelessness of
all treaties, for diplomats, like other
professional traders, sometimes have
old scores to remember. It was none
of these; it was the simultaneous
compositor and infallible proof-reader
oa one Washington and two Cumber
land papers—a journalistic conspira
cy to spell “revenue” with a “g.”
Aiioutu year ago the Journal re
ceived for publication an anonymous
letter. Its reception was acknowl
edged and a statement made to the
effect that until the author made
himselt known to the Journal the
letter would not be published. This
“brought the gentleman to his feet,” j
so to speak. More than this be ex
pressed bis “views” with some energy.
Inasmuch as bis letter “contained
nothing objectionable lie could see
nothing in the reason that it lacked
authority to exclude it from publica
tion.”
At first sight this is plausible. No
fact misstated, no unorthodox opinion
expressed, nobody hurt, why should
newspapers be squeamish about giv
ing them circulation ? No reason
therefor in the world —but one, viz:
To maintain impartially and inflexi
bly the “dead line” drawn at the
threshhold of all correspondence.
On this rock of defence respectable
newspapers stand with spontaneous
and perfect unanimity. No matter
how innocent or inoffensive the mat
tor, the author must cortify his ef
fusions to the publisher under his
personal or autographic endorsement, !
the latter preferred.
Thus at one fell swoop the publish- 1
er is protected against utterances not
his own. He is moreover saved the
trouble of exercising that nice dis
crimination, if lie is so endowed,
which quickly and infallibly discerns
the difference between motives and
pretexts.
The wisdom of this oft-published
newspaper rule was verified last week. .
A letter dated at Allegheny city, j
Pa., and signed “A Subscriber,” was I
received by the Journal. It de- j
tailed the unaccountable killing of
James P. Murto at that place a few
days before and indulged in the cus-,
tomary eulogium upon his life and
talents. The story was straightfor
ward and tolerably well told. It
possessed all the seductive character
istics of a good news item. For once,
however, “distance did not lend en
chantment to the view.” The ab
sence of the sine qua non —a personal
guarantee of the truth of the state
ment —was fatal, and the letter was
laid aside, at least until more conld
be heard concerning the event which
it pretended to relate.
The next day a paragraph in the
Cumberland Xews showed that a
similar letter had been received by
that paper, which also adjudged it as
suspicions. A copy containing the i
reference, sent by some one to Mr. |
Murto, evoked from that gentleman a
letter, published in Wednesday’s is
sue, in which he avers a determina- [
tion to ferret out the perpetrator, and
the News “hopes lie will catch the
chap who is playing these scurvy
tricks and punish him at he deserves.”
Had the Xeu't published the let
ter as scut it might have had to take
some of tko medicine prescribed for
“the chap.”
The long and short of the matter
is—no article deserves publication
which the author is unwilling to
stand by squarely in any event before
or after the worst comes to the worst.
If he fails here, no quality, however, i
bright, should bs permitted to inter
pose its brilliance as a shield against j
the odium of incorrigible cowardice.
Eastern Views of the Coal Trade.
New York. —In bituminous coals,
as all along, supply is large, prices as
low as ever, but undoubtedly present
price* are leading to the materially \
enlarged consumption of such coal.— !
Mining Record.
The trade moves along quietly, and I
thus far no improvement has follow
ed the prospect of a stoppage in the
Cumberland district.
Philadelphia. —The bituminous op
erators are living in hopes that the
Eastern demand will be considerably
augmented, and that their shipments
will reach one million tons. 11l spite
of the slight encouragement, some
three or four tracts will be partially
developed, and entries, runs, and
sidings put in as preparatory steps to
active work, should the market per-1
mit activity. Thecoal men are wait-1
ing on the iron men, and they are j
waiting on the railroad builders, and !
the railroad builders are waiting on
the country to fill up,
Boston. —The announcement of a
twenty per cent, reduction in the
wages of Cumberland coal miners
has relieved the bituminous branch
of the market from the monotony
into which it had fallen. It raises
the possibility of a strike on the oen
hand, in case the cut-down goes into
effect, it places the Cumberland oper
ator on a more even competing basis
with his Clearfield neighbor. The
price of mining in both regions
would then be 40 cents a ton. It lias
been 50 cents in the Cumberland re
region. This gain of ten cents a ton
would go to make up the difference
between Baltimore and Philadelphia
water freights. If a strika must
come, now is a good time for i f . The
matter is in uncertainty, but it is be
lieved that the cut-down will be ac
quiesced in. There is nothing of
importance in the way of business.

GENE 11AL ITE MS .
Congress met Monday. The pres
| ident’s message,a masterly document,
was read, and the two bodies went to
work. This, the second session of the
! 48th Congress, expires March 4th.
It promises to boa busy one.
The electoral colleges met at the
j State capitals Wednesday and cast
I their several votes for President and
Vice-President as appointed by the
l people. The result is—Cleveland
|and Hendricks 219; Blaine and
Logan 182.
Up in Quebec they have a project
on foot to make a trade with Uncle
Sam. They want the forty-fifth
parallel of latitude, which is the
northern boundary of New York aiid
Vermont extended to the Atlantic as
the boundary between Canada and
the United States. In exchange for
this northern tip of Now Hampshire
and about one half of the state of
: Maine, they offer us the island of
Jamaica.
A Change.—Last Monday the
stockholders of the Chesapeake and
Ohio canal company met at Anapolts
and elected Col. L. V. Baughman, of
Frederick city, president of the canal
for one your, vice Lewis Cass Smith,
l of Hagerstown. The board of pub
| lie works, which is composed of Gov
j ernor McLane, Comptroller Turner
j and Treasurer Compton, were unan
imous for Mr. Baughman, no other
name being presented for the place.
! Mr. Baughman, it is understood, will
I qualify next Monday, and at one#
j enter upon his duties, as will th
board of directors. The salary of
the president is $3,000 per annum,
and SI,OOO for traveling eihenses.
The Theory of Vaccination.
Prof. Tyndall suggests that, just
as th soil may be effectual by being
robbed of some essential ingredient
by one abundant crop as to be in
capable of producing another, so in
the human system a parasitic disease
I may so completely exhaust the blood
! of some ingredient necessary ta the
; growth ttnd propagation of the para
, site that the production of a stcond
, j crop iu fatal or considerable quantity
j may be impossible. It would thus
: appear that protective vaccination or
| inoculation is simply the intro
duction into the blood of weakened
and comparatively harmless disease
germs to consume the material which
might become food for similar germs
in a more vigorous and dangerous
condition.
ADDITIONAL LOCAL.
Ilvevltles.- - A copy of the Acts of
IS7B, belonging to th# editor, loaned
several months ago, has gone astray.
For special reasons we would be glad
to have it returned. We have a good
sized library of other books out also.
We remember the wlierabouts of some;
Others have passed beyond our ken.
For general and equitable reasons wo
would be happy to extend all of them
a warm “welcome home.” In justice
to tho books, however, the “fatted
! calf” will not be killed. This hint is
suggested by a disappointment this
j week in putting our hand on a val
uable volume which was not there,
j That book contained information for
which wo had immediate and impera
tive use. Its failure to show up re
minded us that it had been loaned, to
whom only incommunicable Om
niscience and the borrower know.
W# cordially, earnestly and entreat
ingly invite the wanderers to return.
Hoar “Old Times and New” next
Friday eveuisg at Moat’s Opera House.
Several of the boys aro in mourning.
They tampered with a soap man Mon
day. The s. m. relieved five of $5
each and “lit out.” The bereaved ones
ar* estimable members of the com
munity. Everybody likes them. They
1 aio inconsolable. We have not inter
viewed them. The impression is
[ abroad, however, that they have
preambled and resoluted that they
were “overtook” by something which,
for the time being, is worse than 40
cents a ton.
A bunch of keys found. Come to
\ this office.
; A highly esteemed and diserimina
| ting subscriber, writing this week to
j renew his subscription, takes occasion
to say: “I find the Journal to be
still an indispensable article.” There
aro hundreds of others who put equal
value on the same article. Look over
our list and you wiil find a great many
big lumps of the “salt of tho earth.”
Gormanus N. Wright, living on the

that weighed 401 pounds. Hard to

KING’S EVIL
■ Was tho name formerly given to Scrofula
because of a superstition that it could bo
cured by a king's touch. The world la
wiser now, and knows that
SCROFULA
can only be cured by a thorough purifica
tion of the blood. ’ 1 f this is neglected,
the disease perpetuates its taint through
generation after generation. Among its
1 | earlier symptomatic developments are
Eczema, Cutaneous Eruptions, Tu
mors, Uoils, Carbuncles, Erysipelas,
Purulent Ulcers, Nervous and Phy
sical Collapse, etc. If allowed to con
tinue, l&hcumatism, Scrofulous Ca
tarrh, Kidney and Liver Diseases,
Tubercular Consumption, and vari
ous other dangerous or fatal maladies, are
j produced by it,
Ayers Sarsaparilla
]s the only powerful and always reliable
blood-purifying medicine. It Is so effect
ual an alterative that it eradicates from
the system Hereditary Scrofula, and
the kindred poi>ous of contagious diseases
and mercury. At the same time it en
riches and vitalizes the blood, restoring
healthful action to the vital organs anu
rejuvenating the entire system. This great
Regenerative Medicine
Is composed of the genuine Honduras
, Sarsaparilla , with 3 elloin Dock , Stil
ling ia, the lodides of Potassium and
Iron, and other ingredients of great po
tency. carefully and scientifically com
pounded. Its Tomiula generally known
to the medical profession, and the best
physicians constantly prescribe AYEP.’S
Sausapauilla as an
Absolute Cure
For all diseases caused by the vitiation of
tlio blood. It Is concentrated to the high
est practicable degree, far beyond any
other preparation for which like effects
are claimed, and Is therefore the cheapest,
as well as the best blood purifying medi
cine, in tho world.

Julius Caesar
Will always be an historical character, j
and inseparably connected with the |
immortal name of Caesar is the Cloak
he wore at the time of his assassina
tion, when he cried —
“Et tu Brute 1”
and perished in all his glofy. Tho
rents the envious Cassius made with
his dagger when ho helped slay Ciesar
have been embalmed by
Shakespeare,
and will always bo new as long as the
“Bard of Avon” is read and admired
—which will be forever.
Among tho ancient Romans the I oya,
or Cloak, had served distinguishing
uses. One worn by children of both
sexes was trimmed with a broad purple
border, a fashion borrowed from the
Etruscans. Another was worn by
magistrates, and still another by those
engaged in sacred rites. Yet another
was known as the “manly gown,” worn
by boys on completing the fourteenth
year.
Robert Burns,
the Ayrshire ploughman, at the men
tion of whose name the heart of the
world throbs in responsive sympathy
—Burns also takes the Cloak as a sub
ject worthy of preservation in vorso
and gives to the world his —
“Tuk your old cloak about ye.”
Samuel Butler
in his inimitable “Hudibras” tolls us
that the philosopher who had “read
every gloss over” could by his knowl
edge of tho occult sciences and the aid
of the stellar horoscope tell who had
“Nimmed aCloke!”
and wo might go on for columns show
ing that from the time whereof the
mind of man runneth not to the con
trary the Cloak or Coat has been the
badge of royalty, tho insignia of rank,
and the chief mark of distinction in
all lands and in all climes.
Dom Pedro
wears a Cloak composed wholly of the
breasts of a very rare South American
bird, and as only tho breast feathers
are used many hundreds of these birds
are slaughtered for the glory of this
monarch. Charles Wolf tells us in
“The Burial of
Sir John Moore”
that this brave soldier was loft “like
a warrior taking his rest, with his mar
tial Cloak around him.”
Wo have it upon no less an author
ity than
Lord Chesterfield
that spotless ruffles was a necessity in
the make-up of the gentleman of his
age, and a modern authority informs
us that the Cloak, the Cape, the Coat,
or the Dolman (as the case may be)
holds the same place in tho tout ensem
ble of tho ladies’ toilets of to-day that
the tine linen did at that time in the
dress of tho Cavalier.
In logical sequence to the above pre
amble we would say that
TO-DAY
we open the largest, finest and most
stylish lot of Ladies’ Coats, Wraps,
Cloaks, and Dolmans that has ever de
lighted the eyes and charmed tho
pocket-books of the ladies of this hy
perborean burg.
A greater assortment, more varied
styles, or a greater range of prices
could uot be conceived Qr imagined.
Call to-day and be thoroughly con
vinced.
All are Welcome.

FLINTSTONE CANNED GOODS
(SECOND SEASON,)
NOW READY FOR DELIVERY.
Grocers wishing to handle these goods are re
quested to send in their orders at an early day, as the supply
is limited and will be exhausted long before the season of sale
is over. Address all orders to
B. L. TURNER,
Fllntstone, Maryland.
The attention of consumers is invited to the following reasons why
they should use these goods:
Ist—The Sugar Corn, which is brought fresh from the field, cut by hand,
leaving its kernels unbroken, packed in the caus while in its raw state, then
hermetically sealed and cooked in dry steam by a new and improved process,
thereby retaining the natural juice and flavor which corn cut by machine and
cooked in water will not have.
The Tomatoes are gathered fresh and ripe, hand-packed, also cold, and
cooked after being sealed, thus retaining their freshness and flavor.
The Apples and other fruits are hand-picked, hand-cored and packed in
pure granulated sugar and are ready for the table. ’
2d —The utmost care and cleanliness is used and no stale, rotten or bruis
ed fruit or vegetables are used. No doubtful or partially spoiled cans arc re
processed as is the case in many establishments.
3d—NO DANGER OF POISON in using these Goods. Recent thorough
investigation of the cause of poisoning in canned goods establishes the fact
that the chief danger lies in the use of a solution of muriatic acid either in
the making or capping of cans. The most notable of these cases of poison
ing were those in Brooklyn last March, and a rigid investigation by the Board
of Health of that city fixed the causes as being muriatic acid used in capping.
Dr. John C. Johnson, physician to the Board, in a long paper states Ins con
clusions thus:
These were cases of corrosive poisoning from muriate of line amt muriate of tin. * *
* * Reject every article of canned food that does not show the line of resin around the
edge of the cap.
While it is not asserted that the danger of deadly poison is imminent yet
thore is no doubt the use of this acid is liable to produce nausea and indiges
tion, in short, is unsafe. lam happy, therefore, to announce that I have
discarded its use and that my cans were made and caps soldered on by the
use of resin (which is harmless) no acid being used. Do you know of any
other packer that can say the same? With all this care and precaution are
not those goods worth more than some others !
