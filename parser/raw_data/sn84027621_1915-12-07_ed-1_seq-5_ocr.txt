President Wilson delivered at a

Sixty-fourth congress;
Gentlemen of the Congress Since I

you on the btate of the Union the war

a prospect of reorganization and re

problems, the president declares that 1
we should retain unabated the spirit j
which has inspired us throughout the
whole life of our government and
which was so frankly put into words
by President Monroe. , '
We have been put to the test in the
. case of Mexico, and we have stood the
test Whether we have benefited Me.v
Ico by the course we have pursued re
mains to be seen. Her fortunes are in
her own bands. But we have at least
proved that we will not take advan
tage of her in her distress and under
take to impose upon her an order and
government of our own choosing. Lib
erty Is often a fierce and intractable'
thing, to which no boundsKean be set
and to which no bounds of a few ;
men's choosing ought ever to be set.
Every American who has drunk at j
the true fountains of principle and tra
dition must subscribe without reservation-
to the high doctrine of the Vir
ginia bill of rights, which in the great
days in which our government was set j
up was everywhere- among us accept
ed as the creed of free men. That doc
trine is, "That government Is or ought j
to be instituted for the common bene- I
fit, protection and security of the peo-
pie, nation or community;" that "of
all the various modes and forms of ,
government, that is the best which is
capable of producing the greatest de
gree of happiness and safety and is
most effectually secured . against the
danger of maladministration, and that
' when any government shall be found
inadequate or contrary to these pur
poses a majority of the community
hath an Indubitable, inalienable and
Indefeasible right to reform, alter or
abolish it in such manner as shall be
judged most conducive to the public
weal." We have unhesitatingly ap
plied that heroic principle to the case
of Mexico and now hopefully await
the rebirth of the troubled republic,
which had so much of which to purge
' itslf and so little sympathy from any
Outside quarter in the radical but nec
essary process We will aid and be
friend' Mexico, but we will not coerce
her, andour course with regard to her
ought to be sufficient proof to all Amer
ica that we seek, no political suzerainty
or selfish control.
PAN-AMERICANISM HAS
NONE OF EMPIRE'S SPIRIT.
Economic Adjustments Inevitable With
in the Next Generation.
The moral is that the states of Amer
ica are not hostile rivals, but co-operating
friends, and that their grow
ing sense of community of interest,
alike In matters political and in mat
ters economic, is likely to give them a
new significance as factors in interna
tional affairs and in the political his
'tory of the world. It presents them as
In a very deep and true sense a unit
In world affairs, spiritual partners,
standing together because thinking to

and commou ideals. Separated, they
are subject to all the cross currents of
the confused politics of a world of hos
tilerivalries: united in spirit and pur
pose, they cannot be disappointed of
their peaceful destiny.
This is pan-Americanism. It has none
of the spirit of empire in It. It Is the
embodiment, the effectual embodiment,
of the spirit of law and independence
and liberty and mutual service

of individual liberty and or the free
labor that supports life and the uu
censored thought that quickens It.
Conquest and dominion are not in our
reckoning or agreeable to our princi
pies. But just because we demaud un
molested development and the undis
turbed government of our own lives
upon our own principles of right and
liberty, we resent, from whatever
quarter It may come, the aggression we
ourselves will not practice. We Insist
upon security in prosecuting our self
chosen lines' of national development.
We do more than that. We demand it
also for others. We do not confine our
enthusiasm' for individual liberty and
free national development to 'the Inci
dents and movements of affairs which
affect only ourselves. We feel it wher
ever there 13 a people that tries to walk
In these difficult paths of independence j
and righL From the first we have
made common cause With all partisans
of liberty on this side the sea and have
deemed It as important that our neigh
bors should be free from all outside
domination as that we ourselves should
be;. have set America aside as a whole
for the uses of Independent nations and
political freemen.
Out of such thoughts grow all our
policies. We regard war merely as a
means of asserting the rights of a peo
pie against aggression. And we are
as fiercely jealous of coercive or dicta
torial power within our own nation
as of aggression , from without. We
will not maintain a standing army ex
cept for uses which are as ' necessary
in times of peace as in times of war.
SUGGESTS BROAD PLAN
FOR NATIONAL DEFENSE.
Increase Standing Regular Force Four
Hundred Thousand Citizen Soldiers.
But war has never been a mere mat
ter of men and guns. It Is a thing
of disciplined ' might If our citizens
are ever to fight effectively upon a
sudden summons, they must know
how modern fighting is done, and what
to do when the summons comes to
render "themselves immediately avail
able and Immediately effective. And
the government must be their servant
in this matter, must supply them with
the training they need to take care of
themselves and of it The military
arm of their government which they
will not allow to direct them, they may
properly use to serve tbem and make
their independence secure, and not
their own independence merely, but
the rights also of those with whom
they have made common cause, should
they also be put In jeopardy. , Thev
must be fitted to play the great role
in the world, and particularly In this
hemisphere, for which they are quali
fied by principle and by chastened am
bition to play.
It 1s with these ideals in mind that
the plans of the department of war for
more; adequate national defense were
conceived which will be laid before
you. and which I urge you to sanction
and put into effect as soon as they can
be properly scrutinized aud discussed
They seem to me the essential first
steps, and they seem to me for the
present sufficient. ..
They contemplate an Increase of the
standing force of the regular army
from its present strength of 5.023 offi
cers and 102.985 enlisted men of all
services to a strength. of 7.136 officers
and 134.707 enlisted men. or 141,843

Declares That if Full Navy Pro
gram Is Carried Out We Will
Have a Fleet For Defense That
Will Be "Fitted to Our Needs
and Worthy cf Our Traditions."
Greatest Danger to Country
Comes From Within Our Bor
ders. are the additions necessary to render
the army adequate for its present du
ties, duties which it has to perform
not only upon our own continental
coasts and borders and at our interior
army posts, but also In the Philippines,
in the Hawaiian Islands, at the isth
mus and In Porto Rico.
By way of making the country ready
to assert some part of its real power
promptly and upon a larger scale
should occasion arise the plan also
contemplates supplementing the army
by a force of 400.000 disciplined citi
zens, raised In increments of 133.000 a
year throughout a period of three
years. This It is proposed to do by a
process of enlistment under which the
serviceable men of the country would
l e asked to bind themselves to serve
with the colors for purposes of train
ing for short periods throughout three
years andtto come to the colors at call
at any time throughout an additional
'furlough" period of three years. Thi
force of 400.000 men would be pro
vided with personal accouterments as
fast as enlisted and 'their equipment
for the field made ready to be supplied
at any time. Tneywould be assem
bled for training at stated intervals at
convenient places in association with
suitable units of the regular army.
Their period of annual training would
not necessarily exceed two months in
the year.
The president says It is up to the
patriotic young men of the country to
respond to this call.
COMPREHENSIVE PLAN
FOR -GREATER NAVY.
Always Looked to It as Our First and
Chief Line of Defense.
The program which will be laid be-
fore you by the secretary of the navy
is similarly conceived. It involves only
a shortening of the time within which
plans long matured shall be carried
out but It does make definite and ex
plicit a program which has heretofore
been only implicit, held in the minds of.
the committees ou naval affairs and
disclosed in the debates of the two
houses, but nowhere formulated or for
mally adopted. It seems to me very
clear that It will be to the advantage
.of the country for the congress to adopt
a comprehensive plan for putting the
navy upon a final footing of strength
and efficiency and to press that plan
to completion within the next five
years. We have always looked to the
navy of the country as our first and
chief line of defense; we have always
seen it to be our manifest course of
prudence to be strong on the seas.
Year byvyear we have been creating a
navy which now ranks very high in
deed kmong the navies of the maritime
nations. We should now definitely de
termine how we shall complete what
we have begun and how soon. -
The program to be laid before you
contemplates the construction within
five years of ten battleships, six battle
cruisers, ten scout cruisers, fifty de
stroyers, fifteen fleet submarines,
eighty-five coast submarines, four gun
boats, one hospital ship, two ammunl
tion ships, two fuel oil ships and one
repair ship. It Is proposed that of this
number we shall the first year provide
for the construction of two battleships,
two battle cruisers, three scout cruisers,
fifteen destroyers, five fleet submarines,
twenty-five coast submarines, two gun
boats and one hospital ship; the second
year two battleships, one scout cruiser,
ten destroyers, four fleet -submarines,
fifteen coast submarines,, one gunboat
and one fuel oil ship; the third year
two battleships, one battle cruiser, two
scout "cruisers, five destroyers, two fleet
submarines and fifteen coast subma
rines; the fourth year two battleships,
two battle cruisers, two scout cruisers,
ten destroyers, two fleet submarines,
fifteen coast submarines, one ammuni
tion ship and one fuel oil ship, and
the fifth year two battleships, one bat
tle cruiser, two scout cruisers, ten de
stroyers, two fleet submarines, fifteen
coast submarines, one gunboat, one am
munition ship and one repair ship.
The secretary of the navy is asking
also for the immediate addition to the
personnel of the navy of 7.500 sailors.
2.500 apprentice seamen and 1,500 ma
rines. This increase would be suffi
cient to care for the ships which are
to be completed within the fiscal year
1917 and also for the number of men
which must be put in training to man
the ships which will te completed
early In 1918. It is alo necessary that
the number of midshipmen nt the Na
val academy at Annapolis should be
Increased by at least 300 in order thn.t
the force of officers should be more
rapidly added to. and authority is ask
ed to appoint, for engineering duties
only, approved graduates of engineer
Ing colleges, and for service in the avi
ation corps a certain number of men
taken from civil life.
If this full program should be carried
but we should have built or building in
1921. according to the estimates of sur
vival and standards of classification

cy and security in all its asin-ets.
There are other great- matters which
will be thrust upcu our attention
whether" we will 01 not There-is. for
example, a very pressing question of
trade and shipping involved in this
great problem of national adequacy
It is necessary for many weighty rca
sons of uational efficiency and devel
opruent that we should have a great
merchant marine. I he great merc hant
fleet we once used to make us rich,
that great body of sturdy sailors who
used to carry our flag into every sea.
and who wire the pride and "often the
bulwark of the nation, we have almost
driven out of esisteuee by inexcusable
neglect and indifference and by a hope
lessly blind and provincial policy of
so called economic protection. It is
high time we repaired our mistake and
resumed our commercial independence
on the sens.
With a view to meeting these press
ing necessities of our commerce and
availing ourselves at the earliest possi
ble moment of the present unparalleled
opportunity of linking the two Ameri
cas together in bonds of mutual Inter
est and service, an opportunity which
may never return again if we miss it
now. proposals will be made to the
present congress for the purchase or
construction of ships to be owned and
directed by the government similar to
those mado to the last congress, but
modified in some essential particulars.
I recommend these proposals to you
for your prompt acceptance with the
more confidence because every month
that has elapsed since the former pro
posals were made has made the ne
cessity for such action more and more
manifestly imperative. That need was
then foreseen It is now acutely felt
and everywhere realized by those for
whom trade is waiting, but who can
find no conveyance for their goods. 1
am not si much interested in the par
ticulars of the program as I am In
taking immediate advantage of the
great opportunity which awaits us if
we will but act in this emergency. In
this matter, as in all others, a spirit of
commou counrel should prevail, and
out of it should come an early solu
tion of this pressing problem.
SHOULD AGREE ON POLICY
IN THE PHILIPPINES.
Recommends Early Adoption of Meas
ures Giving Them Fuller Justice.
The president recommends the early
adoption of bills for the alteration and
reform of the government of the Phil
ippines and for rendering fuller polit
ical justice to the people of Porto Rico,
which were submitted to the Sixty
third congress The president refers
to the increased cost of carrying out
the plans for the armed forces of the
nation" aud tells of the fiscal problems
confronting the government
On the 30th of June last there was
an available balance In the general
fund of the treasury of $104,170,105.78
The total estimated receipts for the"
year 1910.. on -the assumption that the
emergency revenue measure passed by
the last congress will not be extended
beyond its present limit the 31st of
December, 1915, and that the present
duty of 1 cent per pound on sugar will
kbe discontinued after the 1st of May.
1910. will be $070,305,500. The balance
of June last and these estimated rev
enues come therefore to a grand total
of $774,535,005.78. The total estimated
disbursements for the present fiscal
year, including twenty-five millions for
the Panama canal. twelvemillions for
probable deficiency appropriations and
$50,000 for miscellaneous debt redemp
tions. will be S753.S91.000. and the bal
anee in the general fund of the treas
ury will be reduced to $20,044,005.78.
The emergency revenue act If contin
ued beyond its present time limitation
would produce during the half year
then remaining about forty-one mil
lions. The duty of 1 cent per pound
on sugar if continued would produce
during the tw6 months of the fifccal
year remaining after the 1st of May
about fifteen millions. These two sums,
amounting together to fifty-six mil
lions, if added to the revenues of the
second half of the fiscal year would
yield the treasury at the end of the
year an available balance of $70,044.
005.78.
The additional revenues required to
carry out the program of military and
naval preparation of which I have
spoken would, as at present estimated
be for the fiscal year 1917 $93,800,000
Those fisrures. taken with the figures
for the present fiscal year which I
have already jriven. disclose our finan
cial problem for the year 1917 As
snming that the taxes imposed by the
emergency revenue act and the pres
ent duty on sugar are to be disconttn
ued and that the balance at the close
of the present fiscal year will be only
$20.G44.005.78. that the disbursements
for the Panama canal will again be
about $25.000.(X)0 and that the add!
tional expenditures for the army and
navy are authorized by the congress
the deficit in the general fund of the
treasury on the 3Cth of June. 1917
will be nearly $235,000,000. To this
sum at Iei?t $50,000,000 should be add
ed to represent a safe working balance
for the trpnsury and $12,000,000 to In
elude the usual deficiency estimates In
1917. and these additions would make
a total deficii of some f297.O0O.00O. If
the present t:ixe should be continued
throughout this year and the next
however, there would be a balance In
the treasury of sov.ie $70.5O).t:x at
the end of the present fiscal year and
a deficit at the end of the next year of
only some CoiMWMXKj. or. reckomug in
$02.000.0a) for deficiency appropria
tions and a safe treasury balance at
the end of the year. .1 total deficit of
some $112.00O.00t. The obvious moral
of the figures i that it is a plain coun
koI of prudence to continue all of the
jresent taxes or their equivalents and
confine ourselves to the problem of
providing $112,000,000 of new revenue
rather than $297,000,000.
How shall we obtain the new rev
enue? We are frequently reminded
that there are many millions of bonds
which the treasury is authorized under
existing law to sell to reimburse the
sums paid out of current revenues for
the construction of the Panama canal,
and it is true that bonds for the
amount of $222,432,000 are now avail
able for that purpose. Prior to 1913
$138,000,000 of these bonds had ac
tually been sold to recoup the expendi
tures at the isthmus, and now con
stitute a considerable Item of the pub
lic debt But I for one do not believe
that the people of this country approve
of postponing the payment of tiieir
bills. Borrowing money is shortsight
ed finance. It can be justified only
when permanent things are to be ac
complished which many generations
will certainly benefit by and which it
seems hardly fair that a single genera
tion should pay for. The objects we
are now proposing to spend money for
cannot be so classified, except In the
sense that everything wisely done may
be said to be done in the interest of
posterity as well as In our own. It
seems to me a clear dictate of pru
dent statesmanship and frank finance
that in what we are now, I hope, about
to undertake we should pay as we go.
The people of the country are entitled
to know just what burdens of taxation
they are to carry and to know from the
outset now. The fiew bills should be
paid by internal taxation.
NATION'S SECRET FOES
SHOULD BE CRUSHED.
Gravest Danger to Country Comes
From Within Our Own Borders.
The president says that the precise
reckonings of the problem to be met
are set forth in the report of the secre
tary of the treasury.
I have spoken to you today, gentle
men, upon a single theme, the thor
ough preparation of the nation to care
for its own security and to make sure
of entire freedonl to play the Impar
tial role In this hemisphere and in the
world which we ail believe to have
been providentially assigned to it I
have bad in my mind no thought of
any Immediate or particular danger
arising out of our relations with other
nations. We are at peace with all the
nations of the world, and there is rea
son to hope that no question in con
troversy between this and other gov
ernments will lead to any serious
breach of amicable relations, grave as
some differences of attitude and policy
have been and. may yet turn out to be.
I am sorry to say that the gravest
threats against our national peace and
safety have been uttsred within our
own borders. There are citizens of the
United States, I blush to admit born
under other flags, but welcomed under
our generous naturalization laws to the
full freedom and opportunity of Amer
ica, who have poured the poison of dis
loyalty Into the very arteries of our
national life. Who have sought to bring
the authority and good name of our
government into contempt to destroy
our Industries wherever they thought
it effective for their vindictive pur
poses to strike at them and to debase
our politics to the uses of foreign In
trigue. Their number Is not great as
compared with the whole number of
those sturdy hosts by which our na
tion has been enriched In recent gen
erations out of virile foreign stocks,
but it is great enough to have brought
deep disgrace upon us and to have
made it necessary that we should
promptly make use of processes of law
by which we may be purged of their
corrupt distempers.
America never witnessed anything
like this before. It never dreamed it
possible that men sworn into its own
citizenship, men drawn ot of great
free stocks such as supplied some of
the best and strongest elements of that
little, but bow heroic, nation that in a
high day of old staked its very life to
free Itself from every entanglement
that had darkened the fortunes of the
older nations and set up a new stand
ard here that men of such origins and
such free choices of allegiance would
ever turn In malign reaction against
the government and people who had
welcomed and nurtured tbem and seek
to make this proud country once more
a hotbed of European passion. A lit
tle while ago such a thing would have
seemed incredible." Because It was in
credible we made no preparation for
It We would have been almost
ashamed to prepare for It as if we
were suspicious of ourselves, our own
comrades and neighbors! But the ugly
and incredible thing has actually come
about and we are without adequate
federal laws to deal with it I urge
you to enact such laws at the earliest
possible moment and feel that In doing
so I am urging you to do nothing less
than save the honor and self respect
of the nation. Such creatures of pas
sion, disloyalty and anarchy must be
crushed out They are not many, but
they are Infinitely malignant and the
band of jour power should close over
them at Once. They have formed plot"
to destroy property, they have entered
into conspiracies against the neutrality
of the government they have sought
to pry into every confidential trans
action of the government in order to
serve interests alien to our own. It is
possible to deal with these things very
effectually. I need not suggest the
terms In which they may be dealt with.
I wish that it could be said that only
a few men. misled by mistaken senti
ments of allegiance to the governments
under which they were born, had been
guilty of disturbing the self possession
and misrepresenting the temper and
principles of the country during these
days of terrible-war, when -It would
seem that every man who was truly an
American would instinctively make it
his duty and his pride to keep the
scales of judgment even and prove him
self a partisan of no nation but his
own. But it cannot There are some
men among us and many resident
abroad who, though born and bred in
the United States and calling them
selves Americans, have so forgotten
themselves and their honor as citizens
as to put their passionate sympathy
with one or the other side In the great
European conflict above their regard
for the peace and dignity of the United
States. They also preach and practice
disloyalty. No laws', 1 suppose, can
reach corruptions of the mind and
heart, but I should not speak of others
without also speaking of these and ex
pressing the even deeper humiliation
and scorn which every self possessed
and thoughtfully patriotic American
must feel when he thinks of them and
of the discredit they are daily bringing
upon us.
What is more important Is that the
industries and resources of the country
should be available and ready for
mobilization. It is the more Impera
tively necessary, therefore, that we
should promptly devise means for do
ing what we have not yet done that,
we should give intelligent federal aid
and stimulation to Industrial and voca
tional education, as we have long done
in the large field of our agricultural
Industry; that at the same time that
we safeguard and conserve the natural
resources of the country we should
put them at the disposal of those who
will use them promptly and Intelli
gently, as was sought to be done In
the admirable bills submitted to the
last congress from Its committees on
the public lands, bills which I earnest
ly recommend in principle to your con
sideration; that we "should put into
early operation some provision for
rural credits which will add to the ex
tensive .borrowing facilities already
afforded the farmer by the reserve
bank act adequate instrumentalities
by which long credits may be obtained
on land mortgages and that we should
study more carefully than they have
hitherto been studied the right adapta
tion of our economic arrangements to
changing conditions.
Many conditions . about which we
have repeatedly legislated are being
altered from decade to decade, it is
evident under our very eyes and are
likely to m change even more rapidly
and more" radically In the days Imme
diately ahead of us when peace has
returned to the world and the nations
of Europe once more take up their
tasks of commerce and industry with
the energy of those who must bestir
themselves to build anew.
REGULATIONS TO MEET
RAILROAD PROBLEM.
Needed to Make Lines More Useful
Servants of Country.
In the meantime may I make this
suggestion? The transportation prob
lem Is an exceedingly serious and
pressing one In this country. There
has from time to time of late been rea
son to fear that our railroads - would
not much longer be able to cope with
it successfully, as at present equipped
and co-ordinated. I suggest that it
would be wise to provide for a com
mission of inquiry to ascertain by a
thorough canvass of the whole ques
tion whether our laws as at present
framed and administered are as serv
iceable as they might be in the solu
tion of the problem. It is obviously
a problem that lies at the very foun
dation of our efficiency as a people.
Such an Inquiry ought to draw out
every circumstance and opinion worth
considering, and we need to know
all sides of the matter if we mean to
do anything in the field of federal leg
islation. No one, I am sure, would wish to
take any backward step. The regula
tion of the railways of the country by
federal commission has had admirable
result and has fully justified the
hopes and expectations of those by
whom the policy of regulation was
originally proposed. The question is
not What should we undo? It is
whether there is anything else we can
do that would supply us with effective
means, in the very process of regu
lation, for bettering the conditions un
der which the railroads are operated
and for making them more useful serv
ants of the country as a whole. It
seems to me that it might be the part
of wisdom, therefore, before further
legislation In this field Is attempted,
to look at the whole problem of co-ordination
and efficiency in the full light
of a fresh assessment of circumstance

the several parts of it
For what we are seeking now. what
In my mind is the single thought of
this message. Is national efficiency and
security. We serve a great nation.
We should serve it in the spirit of its
peculiar genius. It Is the genius of
common men for self government in
dustry. Justice, liberty and peace- We
should see to it that It lacks no in
strument, no facility or vigor of law,
to make it sufficient to play its part
with energy, safety and assured suc

PR0?S9TED THE KING.
Italian Zouaves Once Voted to Make
Their Ruler a Corporal.
During the battle of Palaestro. in
1S59. the Austrians in three columns
attacked the Pitrdmontese in order to
throw them back across the Sesia. The
right and center columns were repuls
ed., but the left continued to advance
and threatened danger. At that mo
ment the Tliird zouaves, led by Colonel
Chabran and obeying the orders of Vic
tor Emmanuel I i.. attacked the Aus
trians with the bayonet, threw the en
emy back across the bridy over the
Sesia and drowned many of them in
the Sasetta canal.'
In this memorable battle the king
was constantly in the fiercest of the
fight. The zouaves were enchanted
with his prowess, and in the evening
a sergeant - of the regiment proposed
that they should scud a congratulatory
address to his majesty.
"Let's raise him to the rank of cor
poral." suggested one. which proposi
tion was unanimously adopted. The
scholar of the co;isjuny thereupon set
down in his finest calligraphy:
"By the. wish of the Third regiment
of zouaves Victor Emmanuel, by trade
king of Sardinia, is appointed unani
mously a corKral in the sld regi
ment." Then, while the wish was hot. n
deputation of coiuxrnls aud men went
to Castle Torione, where the king was
staying. The deputation was announc
ed. The king was pleased to receive it
at oue. uotwilhsuin.ihiu the fact that
he was in his shut sleeves, lie was
greatly moved by the token of admira
tion, pressed the stripes to his heart
and conveyed his thanks hi such terms
that the zouaves, in a. delirium of Joy.
cheered him asif they would never
stop, and in taking their leave one and
all embraced their newly appointed
corporal. Pearson's.
PERSONAL FLAGS.
Special Emblems For the President and
Other Officials.
Until 1881 the president of the Unit
ed States had no personal Hag, his
p resein -e on loard an American naval
vessel being indicated by hoisting the
national emblem at. the head of the
mainmast, and the garrison flag, re
served for times of special ceremony,
was displayed. on the staff at army
posts whenever he visited them.
The need of a special tlag for the
president was frequently felt, especial
ly when visiting royalty was entertain
ed in this country. -In August. 1882.
It was directed by the secretary of the
navy that "the flag of the president of
the Uuited States shall consist of a.
blue ground, with the arms of the
United States in the center. The flag
shall be hoisted at the mainmast of
the vessel of war while the president
is on board and shall be carried in the
bow of his boat."
For years after this the national flag
was used for indicating the presence
of the vice president or of an ex-president,
but this use was more or less
l onfusing. and. besides, it was argued,
the stars and stripes properly stand
for the nation rather than any in
dividual. For this reason a special flag
for the vice president was adopted.
"This tlag is the same in design as the
president's naval blue tlag, except that
the national coat- of arms is emblazon
ed on a white field on it. Cabinet offi
cers and the assistant secretaries of
some of the executive departments also
have distinctive flags. Cleveland Plain
