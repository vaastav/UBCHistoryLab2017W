TUESDAY MORNING, DECEMBER 15. 1831.
The grip is again becoming epi
demic.
The Now York Cauip of Confeder
ate Veterans will give a benefit in aid
of the Grant monument fund.
Washington correspondents say
that Stephen B. KIkins will be nomi

A Washington special to the Wheel

Colonel Thomas W. Higginson will
contribute a eharming paper, entitled
"The Lilliputian Theory of Woman,"
to the forthcoming number of Iltxr

Senator Faulkner will introduce a
resolution authorizing the Secretary
of the Treasury to pay over West
Virginia's share of the direct tax,
about 8181,000.
The defeat of Roger Q. Mills for
the speakership has given widespread
support, it is said, to the efforts of
his Texas admirers to elect him to the
United States Senate.
The next number of Harper's Week
ly, published December 16th, will
contain a four page map, giving a
bird's-eye view of the exposition
grounds and buildings at Chicago.
The West Virginia Congressmen
say they would have voted solidly for
Mr. Wilson for speaker at any time,
and proposed to put him in nomina
tion and support him until he or some
one else were chosen.
It is safe to predict, if not a long
"run," at least a large number of
productions on the amateur stage, for
"Bobby Shnftoe," the comic operetta
by H. C. Butler, published in the
Christmas number of Harper's Young
Peoitle.
If we were asked to select from our
exchange list the paper of the most
sterling worth, we would have no hes
itation in choosing the Baltimore Sun.
Its editorials are able, its news full,
well classified and generallj- accurate.
In a word, The Sun is a model news
paper, and its popularity in this sec
tion is best attested by a large and
constantly increasing circle of appre
ciative readers.
To the enterprise of friend Avirett,
of the Cumberland Daily Times, we
give credit for the first full copy of
the President's message placed in our
hands last Wednesday. The Times
supplement containing it was printed
and well on its way towards Cumber
land before the message was offered
for sale on the streets of Washington.
A good bit of journalistic enterprise,
which we are pleased to chronicle.
The message of President Harrison
contains nothing very striking. The
tariff law is, of course, approved, and
the usual matters touched upon are
spoken of in a way complimentary to
the administration. Touching the
New Orleans episode, he recommcnds
that Federal courts be given jurisdic
tion iji offences against treaty rights.
The. tone of the message in dealing
with the attack in Valparaiso upon
the sailors of the I5altimore is strong
and aggressive. The change of method
in selecting presidential electors in
Michigan is referred to with some
feeling, and is made the occasion of a
recommendation that Congress should
fix the method of such appointments
so as to be uniform and free from the
gerrymander. On 1 his scorc thePhil
adelpliia Record sugge'sts that the
Michigau scheme is not a gerryman
der, and is innocence itself beside the
policy of admitting new State3 in or
der to defeat the Teal choice of the
people.
Senator Faulkner has introduced
bills for the relief of the trustees of
the M.-E. Church at Harper's'Ferry,
trustees of M. P. Church of Middle
way, for the relief of William M.
Morrison, Adam Kidwilcr, Edward
Tearney, administrator of Wru. Mc
Sherry, deceased ; a bill providing
for the payment of the amounts due
the employees and the contractors
who furnished castings to the United
States arsenal at Harper's Ferry,
from January 1 to 19, 1801, inclu
sive ; a bill to authorize the Secretary
of War to cause to be investigated
and to provide for the payment of all
claims for the use and occupation of
church, college and school buildings
for government purposes by the Uni
ted States military authorities during
the late war, and the value-of such
buildings destroyed during such oc
cupation by the United States and all
claims for repairs to any such build
ings and the furniture of the same,
rendered necessary by such occupa
tion by the pnited Slates army.
Cleveland Favored Wilson for
Speaker.
If the Deadlock Had Continued, the
TPest Tirginia Man Would Have
Been Offered.
The regular correspondent of the
Philadelphia Press, writing from New
Yorlt under date of December 7, as
serts that it was the intention of
greater politicians to cause a dead
lock in the speakership caucus, by
which ultimately a certain candidate
could be accepted by a sufficient
number to make his nomination as
sured, and then goes on to say:
A few days ago the Press was the
first to hint at the name of the roan
whom those who are nearest to Gro
ver Cleveland here really have had in
mind for the Speakership for several
months. This morning the World
which is frequently the first to scent
important political moves, of all the
ne**papers here, in a, double-leaded
article indicated the possibility of an
ultimate concentration upon Judge
V\ iJson, of West Virginia.
Although not named in caucus, the
politics which have brought his name
in view will be of interest and impor
tance to narrate. Early in the sum
mer. just as Grover Cleveland was
going to his summer home on Buz
zard's Bay, a meeting of his friends
took place here. It was ostensibly
for the purpose of consultation re
specting his prospects, and what
should be done in case it appeared
i!inn chance for the nomination in
- was a very dim one. At that
time the Press printed an account of
the meeting of these men here.
The gathering, however, was not
for the purpose which was then an
nounced. It was to talk over the
Speakership matter. AH of Mr.
Cleveland's friends were in favor of
the nomination of Mr. Mills, for they
said that he alone of the prominent
Democrats in this Congress repre
sented fully the ideas upon which the
Democratic party went before the
country in 1888. Cleveland heard
them all, and when they were through
he said that he had been thinking the
matter over somewhat carefully,?and
had reached the conclusion that per
haps it would be wiser to nominate
another man than Mr. Mills. He ex
pressed in the highest terms his ad
miration for Mills, for his honesty
and sincerity, but he thought that
contingencies had arisen which would
make the selection of another man
for Speaker a matter of higher value
for the party than even the choice of
Mr. Mills could do.
The ex-President said that, some
times it was dangerous for a man to
have a too strong following. Not
only dangerous for himself, but for
the party which he represented. He
feared that a very stiff line would be
drawn separating the friends of Mills
from the friends of another candi
date who might represent some oppo
! sitiCH , to the extreme tariff views cif
11Ir. Mills. In such an emergency it
was always wise to look for a person
who cammanded the respect of everv
j ?MM,',aniJ 'le Ilac* 9Ut;h ? man in mind.
Hurt man he said was Judge Wil
son, of West Virginia. Among all
the acquaintances whom he made
when he was President there was no
man in either house of Congress who
had won a higher regard from him
than Judge Wilson had. He regard
as 111 so,ne respects, one
of the ablest politicians.whom he had
ever met, and also as possessing the
highest qualities of statesmanship
borne of his intellectual qualities sug
gested those of Senator Carlisle
Moreover, Judge Wilson, while'in
! entire accord with the tariff views of
that section of the parly which Mr.
Mills eonspieiously represented, was I
also not regarded as an extremist by
the other wing of the party.
In addition to that, although it
was a matter of minor expediency, it
could not be said of him that he rep
resented the extreme South or the
Northern Democracy, but, living in
West \ irginia, occupied a sort of
neutral or impartial position. The
ex-1 resident said that he did not of
fer these Views with any purpose of
influencing the decision of the Dem
ocratic caucus, but simply to suggest
to his friends that if any emergency
WUson a graDd n'an JlldSe
It was apparent to the men who
heard the ex-President that his choice
for the Speakership was Judge Wil
son, but that lie felt that it would !>ci
unwise and unfair for him to throw
a single straw in the way of Mills'
success, provided he could secure
enough of the members to nominate
him.
What these men have done since
is, of course, a matter of surmise,
but there is an unquestioned feeling
here on the part of the politicians
who are closest to the ex-President,
and who intend to secure his renomi
nation, that the deadlock may possi
bly bo traced back to the day when
Cleveland expressed in such em
phatic terms his opinion of Judge
Wilson and his qualifications for the
Speakership.
The Western Settler's Chosen
Specific.
With every advance of emigration into the
far West, a new demand is created for HoStet
tcr's Stomach Bitter*. Newly peopled regions
are frequently less salubrious than older set
tled localities on accoaut of the miasma which ,
rises from recently cleared land, particularly:
j alomj the hanks of rivers that are subject to
freshets. he agricultural or mining; emigrtttti
soon learns, when he does not already know,
that the Bitters afford the only sure protection
against malaria, and those disorders of the
stomach, liver and bowels, to which climatic
changes, exposure and unaccustomed or un
healthy water or diet subject him. Conse
quently, he places an estimate upon this creat
household specific and preventive commensu
rate with its:intrinsic merits, and is careful to
keep on hand a restorative and promoter of
health so implicitly to be relied upon in time
of need.

man. Duringthe ceremonythe bride
was given away by her father. The
church was tastefully decorated with
potted plants, ferns and evergreens,
trimmed with white roses, and, with
the gas jets and candles burning,
made a beautiful effect. Mendels
sohn's March was rendered while the
bridal party left the church. A re
ception was given the bride and

his wife and his two sons Harry and

barely able to get tip next morning.
Plenty of fresh air relieved them all,
but it was a narrow escape from suf

King of Medicines
Scrofulous Humor ? A Cure
fS Almost Miraculous."
** When I was 14 years of age I had a sever?
attack of rheumatism, and after I recovered
had to go on crutches. A year later, scrofula,
In the form of white swellings, appeared on
various parts of my body, and for 11 years I
was an invalid, being confined to my bed
years. In that time ten or eleven sore3 ap
peared and broke, causing me great pain and
suffering. I feared I never should get well.
*' Early in 188G I went to Chicago to visit a
sister, but was confined to my bed most of the
time I was there. In July I read a book,A
Day with a Circus,' in which were statements
of cuf es by Hood's Sarsap.irilla. I was so Im
pressed with the success of this medicine that
I decided to try it. To my great gratification
the sores soon decreased, and I began to feel
better and in a short time I was up and
out of doors. I continued to take Hood's Sar
saparilla for about a year, when, having used
six bottles, I had become so fully released
from the disease that I went to work for the
Flint & Walling Mfg. Co., and since then
