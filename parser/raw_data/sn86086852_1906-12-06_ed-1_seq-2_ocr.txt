Abroad From Officials, Press and
the Public.
Washington, I>ec, 6.—President
Roosevelt’s annual message occupied
the attention of the senate two and a
half hours yesterday, to the exclusion
of nearly all other business. The ex
ception to this was the Introduction
of a resolution on the Japanese situ
ation by Rayner of Maryland and the
adoption of appropriate resolution*
regarding those member* of the
house who have died since the last
session. At a mark of further re
spect to llu'lr memory, the senate ad
Journod.
The reading of the president s mes
sage consumed two hours and 26
minutes In the house, and was fol
lowed closely by a very large number
of the member*, while the crowded
galleries gave close consideration.

Hero and there the reading of the
document was punctuated with ap
plause and hearty hnndelapplng from
democrats as well n republicans fol

jor portion of the time of the rend

Warmly Praised In London.
U union, Dee. 6,—President Roost'
veil’s message occupies (bo most
prominent place In the leading nows
papers thin morning and has at
traded widespread attention from
government officials, diplomats and
the public. The prevailing tone of
comment Is favorable, particularly
with reference to the president’s
warning of the possible use of fed
era I forces for the protection of Jap
ntiese. This feature has given es
pecial satisfaction In official Japan
esc quarters, where It Is pointed out
that Japan la satisfied to await the
outcome of the Issue between the
state and federal authorities.
The Telegraph says that the pres
ident speaks out resolutely and fear
lessly, knowing that democracy like*
a man who Is not afraid to he its
master,
The Standard *Rye Hie most slgnlil
cant feature of the message Is that
•ho president Is constantly finding
himself ’up against" the American
constitution. Far sighted observers
have long since seen that the United
States has outgrown Us cradle, yet
the conservative sentiment of the
most conservative people on earth
clusters strongly around the consti
tution. If there are to be reforms,
they can only result from drastic re
construction of the political system
and the prospect of their realisation
appears somewhat remote.
Will Call Up Smoot Case.
Senator Harrows of Michigan gave
notice that next Tuesday h > wou.'q

ale the question of the right of Sen

Finds That Accused Murdered Grace
Brown on Big Moose Lake—Coun

clsion Without Emotion.
Herkimer, N. Y., Doc. 5. —The Jury
In Ihe trial of Chester 15. Gillette for
the murder of his sweetheart, Grace
Drown, at. Dig Moose lake, on July II
last, returned a verdict last night of
guilty In the first degree.
Henlence will he pronounced Thurs
day morning, to which time the
court adjourned after the Jury had
reported. Former Senator Mills,
Gillette's counsel, before adjourn
ment announced that when the court
reconvened Thursday he would move
to have the verdict sot aside.
The jury, which had deliberated for
five hours, sent word at 11 o'clock
that a verdict had been reached. A
moment Inter the 11! men filed into
the court and at 11:16 an officer who
had l)et>n sent for Gillette returned
with (he prisoner.
Pale and a trifle nervous apparent
ly, Gillette faced the Jury and when
Marshal Match, Hie foreman, de
clared that a verdict In the first de
gree had boon found, the prisoner
gave no sign of emotion. A few mo
men Ia later when his counsel had an
nonneed his purpose of making a for
Dial motion that the verdict he sot
aside, and the Judge was dismissing
thi' Jurors, Gillette bent over a near
by table and picking up a pencil
wrote something upon a sheet of pa
per. He folded the paper carefully
and placed ll In bis pocket. Iniinedl
ately afterwards he was taken from
the court room hack to his cell.
II was learned that the jury had
some difficulty In reaching an agree
ment. and six ballots were taken he
fore the 12 men agreed Up to that
time the Jury had stood It for con
viction, one for acquittal.
The case was given to the Jury at
6:50, after Judge Devendorf had oc
cupied an hour and IB minutes In his
charge.
When the Jury went to Us room
and Gillette was led back to his cell,
ho asked the deputy. “Are the doors
all locked, sheriff?'’ Apparently he
feared violence, but there wim no
evidence of any Intention of violence
on the part of the big crowd that
swarmed the courtroom. After sup
per the courtroom filled quickly and
many remained long hoping to wit
ness the return of the Jury.
The note which Gillette was seen to
write Immediately after the verdict
wa,s announced was a telegram >o Ids
father at Denver. It read:
“1 am convicted.”
This was one oi the earliest dis
patches carrying the news of G'i-
It tie's doom beyond the walls of Ihe
Courthouse. In response to a mes
sage thal the r porters wanted to
see him. Gillette said to Sheriff Rich
ards:
“Tell them I have nothing to nay,
only l didn’t expect that verdict."
The Jury. It was stated, would hare
r ached a verdict quickly hint I; not
been for one Juror who taought Grace
Drown was a suicide
NO FEAR OF PIRATES.

PLANNED TO CATCH THIEF
Consented to Removal of Property,
and Accused Gets New Trial—
Court Renders Decisions and
Takes Up Next Cases on August
Calendar for Argument.
If the owner of property plans to
allow a thief to steal some property
and have the fellow punished for the
theft, the owner must be exceedingly
careful how far he goes in making it
easy for the intending thief to carry
out his plans. The supreme court
yesterday granted anew trial to John
Topolewski of Milwaukee, convicted
of stealing three barrels of meat
from the Planklnton Packing Cos.
The court held that the company
through Its agents, went so far in
placing the meat on the loading plat
form and in consenting to its remov
al that the convicted man was not
entirely guilty of the alleged crime.
There were also errors in the trial in
the admission of hearsay evidence.
The supreme court yesterday hand

hearing pf arguments of appeals. The
last case argued was 102 on the Au
