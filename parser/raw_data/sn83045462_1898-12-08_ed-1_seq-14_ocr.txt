ATTACK ON MANZANILLO
L- or the Last Operations in the West
Indies
Disappointment on Heoeh inK Notice
Anunil l.*t of th?? SigiiinK of
I he IViht Protocol.
The war t orrespondence now being pre
pared for publication by the navigation
bureau of 'he Navy Department includes an
Interesting leport made by Captain C. F.
Goodrich of the operations of the cruiser
Newark. from which it appears that that
vessel fired the last shot of the war, so
far :.s the operations in the West Indies are
concerned. Thi? report is dated off Man
zanillo. Cuba. August IS, 1?>8, and gives an
account of the operations of that vessel and
hor consorts up to that time. The Newark
left Guantanamo August*.?. and. in company
with the cruiser Resolute, carrying the bat
talion of marines, under Colonel Hunting
ton, proceeded to the westward of San
tiago de Cuba, whef they fell in with the
Hist and Suwanee, off Cape Cruz. It was
then learned that the condition of affairs
at Manzanillo was such as to warrant the
beiief that an attack in force would re
sult in the speed}' capitulation of the gar
rison and city.
Captain Goodrich says that the fleet, then
consisting of th?- following vessels, Newark,
Resolute. Suwanee. Hist, Osceola and Al
varado. 1* ft Cape Cruz on the morning of
August 11 for Cuatro Realts channel, the
Hist with her pilot going ahead in order
to minimize the chances of accident in
navigating waters only imperfectly charted.
The other vessels followed close aboard,
all keeping the lead going constantly. By
a preconcerted system of signals the pres
ence of shoal wattr or other danger could
in this w.iy l?e Instantly communicated
fr>-m the leading ships in ample time to
stop the progress ??f the heavy draught
ships Resolute and Newark. No difficulty
w. s experi' need in getting through Cuatro
R-al > channel, and at dark of ihat day
the fleet anchored inside of the Great Uar
rier rt-ef. in ten fathoms of water, about
forty miles distant from Manzanillo.
lloni hardineut ol M:i n r.s\ n i iio.
The report then continues a? follows:
"f>n the morning of the li'th instant my
little flotilla got under way at V.:W? and pro
ceeded to th^ vicinity of Manzanillo. The
Resolute. Suwanee. Hist and Osceola an
chored well inside of the northern entrance.
I hoisted a flag ?>f truce on the Newark and
proceeded to an anchorage about three miles
distant fr??m the town, whence 1 sent the
Alvarado. also bearing a flag of truce, to
present to the military commandant a de
mand for surrender. This demand was
placed in his hands by Lieutenant Blue.
The reply was to the effect that the Span
ish military code forbade a surrender ex
cept as the sequence of a siege or other
military operation.
?The town being fortified is exempt from
the privileges and immunities attached to
defenseless places. Nevertheless, as you
will perceive from my demand, sufficient
time was given to permit non-combatants
to leave the city. At o'clock f signaled
to the outlying vessels to take the sta
tions off the town which had been assign
ed, and at hauled down the (lag of
truce on the Newark and proceeded to
ward Manzanillo until the shoalness of
the wat? r forbade her further approach.
At M.io fire was opened from this ship on
the batteries, anil was maintained with
tolerable steadiness until 4:15 o'clock, with
an aecuraey surprising in view ??f the short
tim .luring which she had b.-en eoinmis
sioned, the other vessels following shortly
after.

March Through Snoilasro Vnder Arms
and InvHile Spanish Club.
A dispatch from Santiago de Cuba yes
terday says: Today is the anniversary of
the death of Gen. Antonio Maceo and has
been celebrated among the Cubans in San
tiago. A memorial service was held this
morning: in the cathedral, which was crowd
ed Less than two years ago the same ca
thedral witnessed a Te Deum, sung by the
same choir, in celebration of Maceo's death.
Then the cathedral was draped with Span
ish colors. Today the entire edifice was In
black. Interspersed with a few Cuban em
blems.
Considerable annoyance was occasioned
to the United States authorities by the fact
that some seventy-five men. Cubans, march
ed the entire length of St. Thomas street.
*"~<1 w1th nifies and machetes, although
all Cubans are well aware that such con
duct is strictly against the regulations,
armed bodies other than United States
troops not being allowed.
A band of Cubans on horseback entered
the premises of the Spanish Club here this
evening and broke several lamps with
their machetes. The United States author
ities acted promptly. As a result of the
outrage at least half the police force will
be discharged.
OPPOSED TO DALY AWD RE1D.
York Bfpuliltcnn Organization
Will Xot Fight. However.
From the New York Herald, Today.
Senator Piatt and the republican organi
zation will not quarrel with President Mc
Kinley if he appoints Whitelaw Keid am
bassador to Great Britain. They will not
attack Colonel Roosevelt even if he nomi
nates Judge Daly to succeed Judge O'Brien
on the supreme court bench.
They are opposing Mr. Keid because Sen
ator Piatt regards him as a personal enemy,
and Judge Paly because he is a democrat,
and : hey believe a republican governor
should bestow office only upon republicans.
They disapprove the appointment of Major
Avery r>. Andrews as adjutant general for
the .same reason.
t olcnei Roosevelt will be a republican
governor, and I think it is the dutv of every
republican to back up what he does," said
Chaii man Odell of the. republican state
committee yesterday.
"I may differ from him personally, but
whatever he decides is for the good of the
people I shall abide by. We are all deter
m ned to act in harmony. If I were a re
publican governor 1 would not choose any
democrat for office, no matter how good he
might i>e. when I could find a republican
competent to fill that office."
When Odell and Piatt meet Colonel Roose
velt tomorrow they will try to persuade him
to select Judge Cohen Instead of Judge
Daly. They will point out that Daly was
nominated by the republicans to help Coihen
and that if Cohen had not been running no
fight would have been made for Daly. If
Colonel Roosevelt remains firm Piatt and
Odell will submit.
SPANISH \IEW OF THE MESSAOE.
Indignation at Kefercncen to Dr
?truetlon of the Maine.
LONDON, December 8.-The Madrid cor
respondent of the Standard, who contrasts
the indifference of the majority of Span
iards to the President's message with the
anxiety regarding his declarations fore- '
shadowing war, says:
"Only ,n political and official circles is
any interest in the message displayed, and
th're it takes the form of bitterness and
indignation at Mr. McKinley's allusion to
the destruction of the Maine.
"The press d..es not hide its satisfaction
at the indications in the message and else
where that American colonizing will be
fraught with difficulties and expenditure.
The prediction is made that the Nicaragua
canal will lead to trouble between the
United States and Europe."

Should Pensioners Pay for Executing
Voucher* f
To the Dlitor of The Evening .Star:
I happened to be in West Virginia on
"pension day," June 4 last, and having to
execute my own voucher that day, met a
number of West Virginia comrades doing
the !>ame thing, and for certifying our pa
jv-rs the officers charged us each 26 cents
In every case. It excited my wonder, for
no one ever heaj-s of such a thing as charg
ing a soldier any fee in Ohio for any official
service relating to pensions. It was all new !
to me.
Again, yesterday, happening to be lit
Washington on tlie day for executing my
voucher for December, I had the same un
pleasant experience and surprise that I had
in \\ est Virginia last June. I do not blume
the officers, either in West Virginia or In
the District, for exacting these fees from
the poor soldiers, but I do blame the law.
Many a poor soldier or widow cannot raise
oven the trifling sum charged, and I have
heard <?f cases both here and in West Vir
ginia? indeed, I saw one mys-elf in Wash
ington yesterday only, where the poor pen
sioner. unable to pay the notary for execut
ing his voucher, left the voucher with him
until lie, the poor soldier, could go out on
the street and beg the quarter to pay the
fee! It is nothing to most of us, and I per
sonally do not care or feel it in the least,
and do not regard the fee of 25 cents an
excessive charge by any means, but this
is not so with thousands who at the end of
the quatter go broke, and can hardly raise
the money at all. I saw all this as clearly
in 1*77 as I do today, and, as a member of
the Ohio legislature, introduced the law
which makes It ompulsory on all officers
having a seal in Ohio to execute all pension
vouchers, and all papers relating to pen
sions. absolutely free of charge. It saves
the soldiers and soldiers' widows of Ohio
$2(JO.Otf> a year, and since 1877 has saved
them $4.2<?I.OOO at least, for the law applies
as well to applications for pension, in
crease, affidavits, An., as to the quarterly
vouchers. I have had It copied into the
statutes of many states, and if the press
will kin iiy aid me this winter I think Con
gress and the legislatures of all the states
will enact this beneficial, patriotic and
much-needed law.
To this end I have written this letter to
The Star, and most respectfully beg the at
tention of Congress to this subject, of so
much interest to the neediest and most de
serving men and women in the world, for
whom they never can do too much

A REMARKABLE VOYAGE
Report of the Monadnock's Trip to Ma
nila.
Ability, Con nitre. Zenl and Endurance
of tlio Officer* and Men Praised
by Capt. Whiting.
The Navy Department has made publlo a
report from Capt. Whiting.who commanded
the Monadnock on the voyage from San
Franclaco to Manila, In which the latter,
after telling of rome of the hardships en
dured during the trip, pays a well-deserved
compliment to the energy and ability of
the officers and crew, which made possible
what was without doubt the most remark
able voyage ever made by an ironclad ves
sel in an emergency.
Capt. Whiting s report, which reached the
Navy Department through Admiral Dewey,
is as follows;
"1. Notwithstanding the fortuitous con
sequence to myself, attendant upon the
cruise of this vessel to the relief of the
Asiatic fleet at Alanila, I should consider
myself derelict In my duty as commanding
officer, now ihat the war is over, if X failed
to call the attention of yourself and the
department to the highly meritorious ser
vices rendered by this ship's company of
officers and men under the most trying and
difficult circumstances.
"2. The ability, courage, zeal and endur
ance shown by them in crossing the Pa
cific ocean in a vessel of this type, practi
cally a raft, with only sixteen inches free
board, In her overloaded condition, cer
tainly deserves some recognition. A cruise
of over miles in the tropics, in exces
sive temperatures, with what small deck
room there is in the ship packed with coal,
so that sleeping places and sleep were al
most unobtainable luxuries for the forty
days spent at sea?all hands upon a limited
amount of fresh water, struggling with ap
purtenances and engines never designed
tor such overloaded service, continualiv
breaking down and as continually being re
paired?no war duty has been more oner
ous or more disheartening. Anticipating a
light to the death with the enemy's heav
iest force afloat, the voyage has been for
all a forlorn hope from the beginning, rec
ognized us such by all who participated,
heartily joined in without flinching, hap
pily ending without an incident, yet only
needing disaster to emphasize what 1 write.
"?H. 1 commend to the department for such
reward as may be deemed proper the exec
utive officer, Lieutenant Commander C. P.
Perkins. United States navy, for merito
rious services during the war. He has ably
and zealously assisted in keeping the ship
In the most advanced state of readiness
for action from the very outset to the pres
ent day. His ability, close attention to duty
and loyalty are beyond all praise.
"4. I commend also the chief engineer,
T F. Burgdorff, United States navy, who
has stubbornly fought the inherent weak
ness of engines desdgned for harbor use and
successfully forced them through such a
prolonged voyage at sea.
"."V 1 commend also the surgeon, J. M.
Steele, United States navy, whose unremit
ting care and attention has carried the
ship's company through the trying ordeal
without a single fatality, though men were
continually falldng from heat exhaustion.
"fi. All the officers of the ship have re
sponded most zealously to the unusual calls
made upon them, and the ship's company
has been enthusiastically ready and will
ing for whatever duty mfght be demanded
of them. They volunteered by delegation
to coal ship day and night at Guam, al
though nearly prostrated by the heat and
confinement to which they were subjected,
both there and while en route. Too much
praise cannot be given the engineer's force
below who have been incessantly occupied
at times day and night, under the most
arduous circumstances that can be imag
ined on board ship in the tropics, doing
their utmost to keep the machinery in run
ning order.
"7. That I have succeeded in safely bring
ing this monitor so far from her Intended
field of action in such a comparatively short
time, with the Nero for a consort, is
wholly and entirely due to the most patri
otic and energetic support of this ship's
company of officers and men. There is no
better ship's company afloat, and all who
can show upon their records that they
took part in the cruise of the Monadnock
from San Francisco to Manila during the
war with Spain, deserve all the favors
that the Navy Department and a grateful
country can bestow upon them either now
or in the future."
Secretary Long's Acknowledgment.
Secretary Long yesterday wrote the fol
lowing letter directly to Captain Whiting:
"Your letter, No. 187, of October 22, 1808,
from Mariveles, Philippine Islands, ad
dressed to the commander-in-chief of the
Asiatic squadron, approved and forwarded
by him to the department, reporting the
meritorious services rendered by th<j ship's
company of officers and men of the U. S. S.
Monadnock, under your command, is re
ceived.
"2. Your letter, citing in detail the serv
ice of the officers and crew of the Monad
nock, and her long voyage across the
Pacific ocean, on board a vessel constructed
more for harbor defense than for under
taking such a long cruise, under most try
ing circumstances, is most interesting, it
is. at the same time, exceedingly gratifying
to the department that, notwithstanding its
hardships, the vessel was brought safely
to a distant port.
"The department fully realizes that the
cruise of the Monadnock was such as to
call upon the patriotism, courage and abil~
ity of all on board. Fertility of resource,
zeal and endurance in times of emergency
are qualities worthy of the highest com
mendation, and it is evident thai all those
qualities were most conspicuously dis
played by the officers and men of your
command, and merit the hearty thanks and
appreciation which the department extends
to you and to the officers and men on
board the Monadnock, particularly those
mentioned by you?Lieutenant Commander
(\ P. Perkins, U. S. N., executive officer;
Chief Engineer T. F. Burgdorff, IT. S. N.,
and Surgeon J. M. Steele, U. S. N.
"3. Your statement that the ship's com
pany had been enthusiastically ready and
willing for whatever duty might be de
manded of them is only what the depart
ment expected of American seamen, and
It is very pleasing to the department to
know that the confidence reposed in them
was not misplaced.
"4. in conclusion, the department notices
that you modestly give the whole credit for
the successful termination of your cruise
of 7,<*?o miles across the Pacific ocean to
the ship's company of officers and men.
but the department is convinced that in
addition to their services it is indebted to
you for your good judgment, ability and
fine seamanship, qualities most desirable
for a commanding officer to possess.
"f>. You are directed to read this letter
to the ship's company at general muster."
CAPT. STARK'S REPORT.
So Owe Was Killed by the Explo?ion
on the Buy State.
Fortunately the accident on the steamer
Bay State will not interfere seriously with
the execution of the plans of the medi
cal department of the army respecting the
inquiry into the methods practiced in Ja
maica to protect the British soldiers from
climatic dangers.
Surgeon General Sternberg has received a
telegram from Captain A. M. Stark, United
States army, in command of the Bay State,
stating that one man was killed by the
bursting of the condenser and several in
jured by ammonia fumes on the Bay State
while she was about to leave the dock at
New York. He has placed the injured men
en the hospital ship Relief and now asks
for a board of survey to ascertain the cause
of the accident, place the responsibility and
estimate the damage. The captain says
the repairs can be completed within four
days, so Surgeon General Sternberg ex
presses the belief that the ship will be
able to get away by the end of the week,
carrying Dr. O'Reilly to Kingston, Ja
maica.
