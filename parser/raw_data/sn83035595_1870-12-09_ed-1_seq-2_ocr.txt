PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE.
To the Senate and
House of Representatives
- A year of peace and general prosper
ity to the nation has passed since the
last assembling of Congress. We have
through a kind Providence been blessed
with abundant crops, and have been
spared from complications and war with
foreign nations ; in our midst compara-
live narmony nas Deen restored, it
to be regretted, however, that a free ex
ercise of the elective franchise has, by
violence and intimidation, been denied
to citizens in exceptional cases in several
of the States lately in rebellion, and the
verdict of the people has thereby been
reversea.
RECONSTRUCTION.
The States of Vireinia. Mississinni
and Texas have been restored to repre
sentation in our national counr-ils.
Georgia, the only State now without rep
resentation, may confidently be exoerterl
to take her place also at the beginning
of the new year, and then, let us hone.
will be completed the work of recon
struction. With an acquiescence on the
part of the whole people in the national
obligation to pay the public debt created
as the price of our Union, the pensions
to our disabled soldiers and sailors, and
their widows and orphans, and in the
changes to the Constitution, which have
been made necessary by a great rebel
lion, there is no reason why we should
not advance in material prosperity an
happiness as no other nation did after so
protracted and devastating a war.
THE WAR IN EUROPE,
Soon after the existing war broke out
in Europe, the protection of the United
States Minister in Paris was invoked in
favor of the North Germans domiciled
in French territory instructions were
issued to grant the protection ; this has
been followed by the extension of Amer
ican protection to the citizens of Saxony.
Hesse, and Saxe-Coburg Gotha, Colom
bia, Portugal, Uruguay, the Dominican
Republic, Equador, Chili, Paraguay and
Venezuela, in Paris. The charge was
an onerous one,., requiring constant and
severe labor, as well as the exercise of
patience, prudence and good iudsrment-.
it has been performed to the entire sat
isfaction 01 this Government, and as I
am officially informed, equally to the
satislaction .01 me Government 01 North
Germany. As soon as I learned that a
Republic had been proclaimed at Paris,
and that the people of France had ac
quiesced in the change, the Minister of
the United States was directed by tele
graph to recognize it and tender my
congratulations and those of the people
of the United States. The re-establishment
in France of a system of govern
ment disconnected with the dynastic
traditions of Europe, appeared to be a
proper subject for the felicitations of
Americans. Should the present strug
gle result in attaching the hearts of the
French to our simpler forms of repre
sentative government, it will be a subject
of still greater satisfaction to our people.
While we make no effort to impose our
institutions upon the inhabitants, and
while we adhere to our traditional iseu
trality in civic contests elsewhere, we
cannot be indifferent to the spread of
American political ideas in a great and
highly civilized country lake France. We
were asked by tbe new government to
use our good offices jointly with those of
European powers in the interest of peace.
Answer was made that the established
politics and the true interests of the
United States, forbade them to interfere
in the European questions jointly with
European Powers. I ascertained in
formally and unofficially that the Gov
ernment of North Germany was not then
disposed to listen to such representation
from any Powers, and though earnestly
wishing to see the blessings of peace re
stored to belligerents, with all of whom
the United States are on terms of friend
ship, I declined on the part of this Gov
ernment to take a step which could only
result in injury to our true interest, with
out advancing the object for which our
intervention was invoked. Should the
time come when the action of the United
States can hasten the return of peace by
a single hour, that action will be heartily
taken. I deemed it prudent, in view of
the number of persons of German and
French birth living in the United States,
to issue, soon after the official notice of
a state of war had been received from
both belligerents, a proclamation defin
ing the duties of the United States as a
neutral power, and the obligations of
persons residing within the territory to
observe their laws and the laws of na
tions. The proclamation was followed
by others, as circumstances seemed to
call for them. The people, thus ac
quainted in advance, of their duties and
obligations, have assisted in preventing
violations ot the neutrality of the j nited
States.
THE INSURRECTION IN CUBA.
It is not understood that the condition
of the insurrection in Cuba has material
ly changed since the close of the last
session of Congress. In an early stage
of the contest the authorities of Spain
inaugurated a system of arbitrary ar
rests, of close confinement, of military
trial and execution of persons suspected
of complicity with the insurgents, and
of summary embargo of their properties
and requisition of their revenues by Ex
ecutive warrant. Such proceedings, as
far as they affected the persons or prop
erty of citiiens of the United States,
were in violation of the provisions of the
treaty of I7Q5, between the United
State's and Spain. Representations of
injuries resulting to several persons
claiming to be citizens of the United
States, by reason ot such violations,
were made to the Spanish Government
in April, i860, lo June last, the Span
ish Minister at Washington had been
clothed with a limited power to aid in
redressing such wrongs. that power
was found to be withdrawn, in view, as
it was said, of the unfavorable situation
in which the Island ol Cuba then was,
which, however, did not lead to revolu
tion or suspension of the extraordinary
and arbitrary functions exercised by the
Executive power in Cuba, and we were
obliged to make our complaint at Mad
rid. In the negotiations thus opened,
and still pending there, the United States
onlv claimed that for the future the rights
secured to their citizens by treaty should
be respected in Cuba, and that as to the
past, a joint tribunal should be estab
lished in the United States, with full ju
risdiction over all such claims before
such an impartial tribunal, and each
claimant would be required to prove his
case. On the other hand, Spain would
be at liberty to traverse every material
fact, and thus complete equity would be
done. A case which at one time threat
ened seriously to affect the relations be
tween the United States and Spain, has
lready been disposed of in this way.
1 he claim of Col. Lloyd, owner ot the
spinwall, for the illegal seizure and de
tention of that vessel, was referred to ar
bitration, by mutual consent, and has
resulted in an award to the United States,
for the owners of the same, of nineteen
thousand seven hundred and two dollars
and fifty cents in gold. Another, and
long pending claim ot like nature, that
of the whaleship Canada, has been dis
posed of by friendly arbitration. During
the present year it was referred, by the
joint consent of Brazil' and the United
States, to the decision ot sir r-awaru
Thornton, Her Britannic Majesty"s Min
ister at Washington, who kindly under
took the laborious task of examining
the voluminous mass of correspondence
and testimony submitted by the two Gov
ernments, and showed to be due to the
United States the sum ot one hunorea
thousand seven hundred and forty dol
lars and nine cents in gold, which has
since been paid by the Imperial Gov
ernment. 1 hese recent examples snow
that the mode which the United States
have proposed to Spain for adjusting the
pending claims is just ana ieasipie, ana
that it mav be aereed upon by either na-
tion without dishonor, it as to ue nopcu
j . . .
that this moderate demand may be ac
ceded to bv Spain without further delay
Should the pending negotiations unfor
tunately and unexpectedly De witnout
result, it will then become my duty to
communicate that fact to Congress and
invite its action on the subject.
SPAIN AND SOUTH AMERICAN REPUBLICS
The long deferred peace conference
between Spain and the allied South
American Republics has been inaugur
ated in Washington under the auspices
of the United States. Pursuant to the
recommendations contained in the reso
lution of the House of Representatives
of the 17th of December, 1866, the Ex
ecutive Department of the Government
offered its friendly offices for the promo
tion ot peace and harmony between
Spam and the allied Republics. Hesita
tion and obstacles occurred to the ac
ceptance of the offer. Ultimately, how
ever, a conference was arranged and was
opened in this city on the 29th of Octo
ber last, at which 1 authorized the Sec
retary of State to preside. It was at
tended by the Ministers of Spain, Peru
Chili and Equador. In consequence of
the absence ot a representative irom
Bolivia, the Conference was adjourned
until the attendance of the Plenipoten
tiary from that Republic could be se
cured or other measures could be adopt
ed toward compassing its object. The
allied and other Republics of Spanish
origin on this continent may see in this
fact a new proof of our sincere interest
in their behalf, our desire to see them
blessed with good governments, capable
of maintainine order nnrl nrcsirvtrw
their respective territorial integrity, and
ci our sincere wisn to extend our own
commercial and social relations with
them.
EUROPEAN RELATIONS TO CEASE.
The time is not probably far distant
when, in the natural course ot events
the European political connection with
this continent will cease. Our policy
should be shaped in view of this proba
bility, so as to ally the commercial in
terests of the Spanish-American States
more closely to our own, and thus -give
the United States all the pre-eminence
and all the advantage which Mr. Mon
roe, Mr. Adams and Mr. Clay contem
plated when they proposed to join the
Congress of Panama. .
ANNEXATION OF SAN DOMINGO.
During the last session of Congress, a
treaty for the annexation of the Repub
lic of San Domingo to the United States,
failed to receive the requisite two-thirds'
vote of the Senate. I was thoroughly
convinced then that the best interests of
the country, commercially and material
ly, demanded its ratification. Time has
only confirmed me in this view. I now
firmly believe, that the moment it is
known that the United States have en
tirely abandoned the project of accept-
. vi 11s territory, tne lsiana 01
San Domingo, a free port will be ne
gotiated by European nations.
In the Bay of Samana a large com
mercial city will spring up, to which we
will be tributary without receiving cor
responding benefits. The Government
of San Domingo has voluntarily sought
mis annexation, it is a weak power,
numbering probably less than one hun
dred and twenty thousand souls, and yet
possessing one of the richest localities
under the sun, capable of supporting a
population of ten millions of people in
luxury. The people of San Domingo
are not capable of maintaining them
selves in their present condition, and
must look tor outside support. They
yearn for the protection of our custo
dians, of our progress, and our civiliza
tion. Shall we refuse them ? The ac
quisition of San Domingo is desirable,
because of its geographical position. It
commands the entrance to the Carribean
Sea and the Isthmus transit of com
merce. It possesses the richest soil,
best and most capacious harbor, most
salubrious climate, and the most valua
ble products of the forest, mine and soil,
of any of the West India Islands. Its
possession by the United States will, in
a few years, build up a coastwise com
merce of immense magnitude, which will
go far toward restoring to us our mer
chant marine. It will give us those
articles which we value greatly and do
not produce, thus equalizing our ex
ports and imports. In case of a foreign
war it will give us command of all the
islands referred to, and thus prevent an
enemy from possessing himself of a ren
dezvous upon our coast. Our coast
trade between the States bordering on
the Atlantic and those bordering on the
Gulf of Mexico is by the Bahamas and
the Antilles. Twice we must, as it were,
pass through foreign countries to get by
from Georgia to the east coast of Flori
da. San Domingo, with a staple gov
ernment under which her immense re
sources can be developedwill give re
munerative wages to tens ol thousands
of laborers not now upon the island.
This labor will take advantage of every
available means of transportation lo
abandon the adjacent islands and seek
the blessings of freedom and its se
quence, each inhabitant receiving the
reward of his own labor. Porto Rico
and Cuba will have to abolish slavery
as a measure of self-preservation to re
claim their laborers. San Domingo will
become a large consumer of the products
of the northern farms and manufactures.
The cheap rate at which her citizens can
be furnished with food and machinery
will make it necessary that the contig
uous islands should have the same ad
vantages, in order to compete with the
productions of sugar, coffee, tobacco,
tropical fruits, &c. This will open to us
a wider market for our products. The
production ot our own suppbes of
these articles, will cut off more than
one hundred millions of our annual im
ports, besides increasing our exports.
With such a picture it is easy to see how
our large debt abroad is ultimately to be
extinguished. With a balance of trade
against us, including the interest of bonds
held by foreigners and money shipments,
by our citizens traveling in foreign lands,
equal to the entire yield of precious
metals, it is not so easy to see how this
result is to be otherwise accomplished.
The acquisition of San Domingo is an
adherence to the Monroe doctrine, is a
measure of National protection. It is but
asserting our just claim to a controlling
influence over the great commercial traf
fic soon to flow from west to east by
way of the Isthmus of Darien. It is to
build up our merchant marine. It is to
furnish new markets for the products
of our farms, shops and manufac
tories ; it is to make slavery in
supportable in Cuba and Porto Rico
at once, and ultimately so in Brazil ; it
is to settle the unhappy condition of
Cuba and end an exterminating con
flict ; it is to provide honest means of
paying our honest debts without over
taxing the people ; it is to furnish our
citizens with the necessaries of everyday
life at cheaper rates than ever before,
and it is, in fine, a rapid stride toward
that greatness which the intelligence, in
dustry and enterprise of the citizens- of
the United States entitle this country 0
assume among nations. In view of the
importance of this question, I earnestly
uige upon Congress an early expres
sion of its views as to the best means of
acquiring San Domingo. My sugges
tion is, that by a joint resolution of the
two houses of Congress the Executive
be authorized to appoint a commission
to negotiate a treaty with the authorities of
San Domingo for the acquisition of that
Island, and that the appropriation be
made to defray the expenses of such
commission. The question may then
be determined by the action of the two
houses 01 Congress upon a resolution ot
annexation, as in the case of the acqui
sition of Texas. So convinced am I of
the advantages to flow from the acquisi
tion of San Domingo, and ot the great
disadvantages, nay, almost calamities,
to flow from the non-acquisition that I
believe the subject has only to be inves
tigated to be approved.
SMUGGLING ON MEXICAN BORDERS.
It is to be regretted that our represen
tations in regard to the injurious effects,
especially upon the revenues of the
United States, ot the policy of the Mexi
can Government in exempting from im
port duties a large tract ot its territory
on our borders, have not only been fruit
less, but that it is even proposed in that
country to extend the limits within which
the privilege adverted to has hitherto
been enjoyed. The expediency of look
ing into this matter demands your serious
consideration. Proper means for coun
tervailing the policy referred to .will, it
is presumed, engage your earnest at
tention. It is the obvious interest, es
pecially in neighboring nations, to pro
vide against injury Irom those who have
committed high crimes within their bor
ders, and who may have sought refuge
abroad. For this purpose extradition
treaties have been concluded with sev
eral of the Central American Represen
tatives, and others are in progress.
CLAIMS AGAINST VENEZUELA.
1 he sense ot congress is desired, as
early as may be convenient, on the pro
ceedings of the committee on Claims
of Venezuela,: which were communicat
ed in messages of March 4th, 1868;
March 1st, 1S70, and March 31st, 1870.
It has not been deemed advisable to dis
tribute any of the money which has
been received from that Government
until Congress shall have acted on the
suDject.
THE CHINESE MASSACRE.
The massacres of French and Rus
sian residents at lien lsin, under cir
cumstances of great barbarity were sup
posed to have been premeditated, and
indicate a purpose among the populace
to exterminate foreigners. The evidence
fails to establish such a supposition, but
shows a complicity by the local author
ities. The Government at Pekin, how
ever, seems to have been disposed to
fulfill its treaty obligations so far as it
was able to do so. Unfortunately the
news of the war between the German
States and France reached China soon
alter the massacre. It would appear that
tne popular mind became possessed
with the idea that this contest would be
extended to Chinese waters, would neu
tralize tne christian influence and nower.
and that the time was coming when the
superstitious mass micht exnel all for-
. eigners and restore Mandarin influence;
and expecting trouble from this cause I
invited trance and North Germany
to make an authorized suspension of
hostilities in the east where they were
temporarily suspended by act of the
commanders, so as to act together for
future protection in China of the lives
and property of Americans and Euro
peans. THE SLAVE TRADE.
Since the adjournment of Congress the
ratification of the treaty with Great Brit
ain for abolishing the mixed courts for
the suppression of the slave trade has
been exchanged. It is believed that the
slave trade is now confined to the east
ern portion of Africa, whence the slaves
are taken to Arabian markets.
THE NATURALIZATION TREATY. '
The ratifications of the naturalization
treaty between Great Britain and the
United States have also been exchanged
during the recess, and thus a long stand
ing dispute between the two Govern
ments has been settled in accordance
with the principles always contended for
by the United States.
NORTHWESTERN BOUNDARY.
In April last, whilst engaged in locat
ing a military reservation near Pembina,
a corps of engineers discovered that the
commonly received boundary line be
tween the United States and the British
possessions at that place, is about 4,700
feet south of the true position of the
49th parallel, and that the line when
run on what is now supposed to be the
true position of that' parallel, would
leave the Fort of the Hudson Bay Com
pany at Pembina, within the territory of
the United Mates. this intormation
being communicated to the British Gov
ernment, I was requested to consent and
I did consent that the British occupa
tion of the Fort of the Hudson Bay
Company should continue for the - pres-
enL I deem it important, however, that
this part of the boundary line should be
definitely fixed by a joint commission ol
the Governments, ana suDmit nerewitn
estimates of the expenses of such a
commission on the part of the United
States, and recommend an appropria
tion for that purpose. The land boun
dary is already fixed, and marked from
the summit of the Rockv Mountains to
the Georgian Bav. It should now be in
like manner marked from the Lake of
the Woods to the summit of the Rocky
Mountains.
THE ALABAMA CLAIMS.
I regret to say that no conclusion has
been reached tor the adjustment ot
claims against Great Britain growing
out of the course adopted by the gov
ernment during the Rebellion. 1 he
Cabinet ot London, so far as its course
has been expressed, does not appear to
be willing to concede that her Majesty s
Government was guiltv of negligence
or did or permitted anything during the
war for which the United States had
just cause of complaint. My firm and
unalterable convictions are unchanged.
and I therefore recommend to Con
gress to authorize the appointment ot a
commission to take proof of amounts
and the ownership ot these claims on
notice to the representative of her Maj
esty at Washington and that authority
be given for" the settlement of these
claims by the United States, so that the
Government will represent the owner
ship of the private claims as well as the
responsibility of all the demands against
Great Britain. It cannot be necessary
to add that whenever her Majesty s Gov
ernment shall entertain a desire for J
full and friendly adjustment of those
claims, the United States will enter up
on their consideration with an earnest
desire for a conclusion- consistent with
the honor and dignity of both countries
THE FISHERY QUESTION.
The course pursued by the Canadian
authorities toward the fishermen of the
United States during the past season
has not been marked by a friendly feel
ing. By the hrst article ol the conven
tion of 1818, between Great Britain and
the United States, it was agreed that the
inhabitants of the United States should
have forever, in common with British
subjects, the right of taking fish in cer
tain waters therein defined. In the wa
ters not included in the limits named in
the convention were those within three
miles of ports of the British coast. It
has been the custom for many years to
give to intruding fishermen of the Uni
ted States a reasonable warning of their
violation ot the technical rights of Great
Britain, lhe Imperial government
understood to have delegated the whole
or a share of its lunsdiction or control
of these inshore fishery grounds to the
Colonial authority, known as the Do
minion of Canada, and this semi-inde
pendent but irresponsible agent has ex
ercised its delegated powers in an un
friendly way. Vessels have been seized
without notice or warning, in violation
of the custom previously prevailing, and
have been taken into the colonial ports.
their voyages broken up, and the ves
sels condemned. There is reason to be
lieve that this unfriendly and vexatious
treatment was designed to bear harshly
upon the hardy fishermen of the United
States, with a view to political ettect up
on the government. The officers of the
Dominion of Canada assume a still
broader and more untenable jurisdiction
over the vessels of the. United States.
They authorize officers or persons to
bring vesselsahovering within three ma
rine miles ol any ot the coasts, bays
creeks or harbors of Canada into port to
search the cargo, and examine the mas
ter, on oath, touching the cargo and
voyage, and to inflict upon him heavy
pecuniary penalty if a true answer were
not given: and it such vessel is tound pre
paring to fish within three marine miles
of any such coasts, bays, creeks or har
bors, without a license, or after the ex
piration of the period named in the last
license granted to it, they provide that
the vessel with her tackle. Sc., &c.
shall be forfeited. ' It is not known that
any condemnations have been made
under this statute. Should the authon-
ities of Canada attempt to enforce it,
will become my duty to take such steps
as may. be necessary to protect the
rights ot the citizensot the United States
It has been- claimed by her Majesty
officers that the fishing vessels of the
United States have no right to enter the
open ports ol the British possessions
North America, except for the purposes
ot shelter and repairing damages, pur
chasing wood and obtaining water : that
they have no right to enter at the Brit
ish Custom Houses, or to trade, except
tor the purchase ol wood and water, and
that they must depart within twenty-four
hours after notice to leave. It is not
known that any seizure of a fishing ves
sel carrying the flag of the United States
has been made under this claim which, so
far as founded on any alleged construction
the convention of 18 18, can not be
acquiesced in by the United States.
is hoped that it will not be insisted on
by her Majesty's government. -During
the conterence which preceded the ne
gotiations of the convention of 1 818 the
British Commissioners proposed to ex
pressly exclude the fishermen of the
United States from the privilege of car
rying on trade with any of his Britannic
Majesty's subjects residing within the
limits assigned for their use, and also
that it should not be lawful for the ves
sels of the United States, engaged
such hshing, to have on board any
goods, wares or merchandise whatever,
except such as may be necessary for the
prosecution ot their voyages to and irom
said fishing grounds, and any vessel of
the United States, which shall contra
vene this regulation, may be seized
condemned and confiscated, with her
cargo. . This proposition which
identical with the construction now put
upon the language of the convention
was emphatically rejected by the Amer
ican commissioners, and thereupon was
abandoned bv the British Plenipoten
tiaries, and Article 1. as it stands in the
convention, was substituted. If, how
ever, it be said that this claim is found
ed on provincial or colonial statutes
and not upon the convention, this gov
ernment can not but regard them as un
friendly, and in contravention of the spi
it if not the letter of the treaty, for the
faithful execution of which the Imperial
eovernment is alone responsible. An
ticipating that an attempt may possibly be
made by the Canadian authorities in the
comine season to repeat these unneign
borly acts towards our fishermen, I rec
ommend you to confer upon the Execu
tive the power to suspend by proclama
tion the operations of the laws authorizing
the transit ot coods. wares ana mer
chandise in bond across the territory of
the United States to Canada ; and fur
ther, should such an extreme measure
become necessary, to suspend the ope
ration of any laws whereby the vessels
of the Dominion of Canada are permit
ted to enter the waters of the United
States,
THE NAVIGATION OF THE ST. LAWRENCE,
A like unfriendly disposition has been
manifested on the part of Canada in the
mamtamance of a claim of a right to
exclude the citizens of the United States
from the navigation of the SL Lawrence.
The river constitutes a natural outlet of
the lakes to the ocean, for eight States
with an aggregate population of about
7,fxx,ooo inhabitants, ana wan an ag
gregate tonnage of 661,367 tons upon the
waters which discharge into it. The for
eign commerce of our ports on these wa
ters is open to British competition, and the
major part of it is done in British bot
toms. If the American seamen be ex
cluded from this natural avenue to the
ocean, the monopoly of the direct com
merce of the lake ports with the Atlan
tic would be in foreign hands; their
vessels on trStas-Atlantic voyages, hav
ing an access to our lake ports which
ould be denied to American ves
sels on similar voyages. To state
such a proposition is to refute its
justice. During the administration of
Mr. john Ouincy Adams, Mr. Clay
unquestionably demonstrates the natu
ral right of the citizens of the United
States to the navigation of this river.
claiming that the act of the Congress of
lenna, in opening the Rhine and
other rivers to all nations, showed the
judgment of European jurists and states
men that the inhabitants ot a country
through which a navigable river passes
have a natural right to enjoy the navi
ga.ion of that river to and into the sea,
even though passing through the territo
ry of another power. This right does
not include the coequal right of the sov
ereign possessing the territory through
which the nver debouches into the sea to
make such regulations relative to the
policy 01 navigation as may be really
necessary, but these regulations should
be framed in a liberal spirit of comity,
and should not impose needless burdens
upon the commerce which has the right
of transit. It has been found in practice
more advantageous to arrange these
equirements by mutual agreement.
lhe United states are ready to make
anv reasonable arrangement as to the
police of the St. Lawrence which may be
suggested by Great Britain. If the claim
by Mr. Clay was just, when the popula
tion of the States bordering on the
hores of the lakes was only 3,400,000, it
now derives greater torce ana equity
from the increased population, wealth
production and tonnage ot the btates on
the Canadian frontier. Since Mr. Clay
advanced his argument in behalf of our
rights, the principle tor which he con
tended has been frequently and by vari
ous nations recognized by law or by
treaty, has been extended to several
other rivers. By the treaty concluded
at Mayence, in 1031, the Rhine was
declared free from the point where it is
first navigable into the sea. By the
convention between Spain and Portugal,
concluded in 1835, the navigation of the
Dours throughout its whole extent was
made free for the subjects of both
crowns. In 1853 the Argentine confed
eration by treaty threw open the free
navigation of the Parana and Uruguay
to the merchant vessels of all nations.
In i8;6 the Crimean war was closed by
a treaty which provided for the free nav
igation of the Danube. In 1858 Bolivia,
by treaty, declared that it regarded the
rivers Amazon and La Plata, in accord
ance with the fixed principles of natural
law, as highways or channels opened by
nature lor the commerce ot all nations.
In 1850 the Paraguay was made free by
treaty, and in December, 1866, the Em
peror of Brazil, by Imperial decree, de
clared the Amazon to be open along all
the frontier of Brazil to the merchant ships
of all nations.
The greatest living British authority
on the subject, while asserting the ab
stract right of the British claims, says it
seems difficult to deny that Great Britain
may ground her retusal on strict law,
but it is equally difficult to deny, first.
that in so doing she exercises harshly an
extreme and hard law ; secondly, that
her conduct with respect, to the naviga
tion of the St. Lawrence is in glaring
and discreditable inconsistency with her
conduct with respect to the navigation of
the Mississippi. On the ground that she
possessed a small domain in which the
Mississippi took its rise, she insisted on
this right to navigate the entire volume
of its waters. On the ground that
she possessed both banks of the St.
Lawrence where ft disembogues into the
sea, she denies to the United States the
right of navigatkua through about one
half of the waters of the Lakes. On
tario, Erie, Huron and Superior, and the
whole of Lake Michigan, through which
the river flows, are the property of the
United States.-
The whole nation is interested in- se
curing cheap transportation from the ag
ricultural States of the West to the At
lantic seaboard. To the citizens of those
States it secures a greater return for their
labor : to the inhabitants ot the sea
board it offers cheaper food, and to the
nation an increase in the annual surplus
of wealth. It is hoped that the gov
ernment of Great Britain will see the
justice of abandoning the narrow and
inconsistent claims to wnicn ner Ca
nadian Provinces have urged her adhe
rence. RELIEF OF COMMERCE.
Our depressed commerce is a subject
to which I called your special attention
at the last session. I suggest that we
we will, in the future, have to look more
to the countries south of us, and to China
and Japan, for its revival. Our repre
sentatives to all these governments have
exerted their influence to encourage
trade between the United States and the
countries to which they are accredited",
but the fact exists that the carrying is
done almost entirely in foreign bottoms,
ana while this state of affairs exists, we
cannot control our due share of the com
merce of the world. That between the
Pacific States and China and Japan is
about all the carrying trade now con
ducted in American vessels. I would
recommend a liberal policy toward that
line of American steamers, one that will
insure its success and even increase its
usefulness. The cost of building iron
vessels, the only ones that compete with
foreign ships in the carrying trade, is so
much greater in the United States than
in foreign countries, that without some
assistance from the government they can
not successfully be built here. There
will be several propositions laid before
Congress in the course of the present
session, looking to a remedy for this
evil. Even if it should be at some cost
to the National Treasury, I hope such
encouragement will be given as will se
cure American shipping on the high
seas, and -American ship building at
home.
DEPARTMENT MATTERS.
The condition of the archives at the
Department of State calls for the early
action ot Congress. 1 he building now-
rented by that Department is a frail
structure, at an -inconvenient distance
from the Executive Mansion and from
the other Departments. It is ill adapted
to the purpose for which it is used, has
not capacity to accommodate the ar
chives, and is not fire-proof. Its remote
situation, its slender construction, and
the absence of a supply of water in the
neighborhood, leave but little hope of
safety for either the building or its con
tents in case of the accident of a fire.
Its destruction would involve the loss of
the rolls containing the original acts and
resolutions of Congress and the historic
records of the Revolution, and of the
confederation, of the whole series of dip
lomatic and consular archives since the
adoption of the Constitution, and of
many other valuable papers left with
that Department when it was the prin
cipal depository of the government ar
chives. I recommend an appropriation
for the construction of a building for the
Department of State. I recommend to
your reconsideration the propriety ol
transferring to the Department of the
Interior, to which they seem more appro
priately to belong, all powers and other
duties in relation to the Territories with
which the Department of State is now
charged by law or usage ; and from
the Interior Department to the War De
partment, the Pension Bureau, so far as
it regulates the payment of soldiers'
pensions. I would further recommend
that the payment of naval pensions be
transferred to one of the Bureaus of the
Navy Department,
THE ESTIMATES FOR THE FISflAXi TEAR.
The estimates for the expenses of the
government lor the fiscal year are
(18,244,340 less than for the current
, one, but exceed the appropriations for
the present year for the same items
3,972.127 5G. In this estimate, how
ever, is included $22,338,278 37 for pub
lie works herei ofore bepun under Con
gressional provision, and of which only
so much is asked as Congress may
choose to give. The appropriaton for
the same works for the present fiscal
year was 11,94,518 08.
GOLD AND GREENBACKS TAXES SPECIE
PAT ME NT.
The average value rf gold as com
pared with the national currency for
the whole of the year 18i9 was about
134, and for eleven months of 1870 the
same relative value has been about
115. The approach to a specie basis is
very praiitying, but the fact can not be
denied that the instability of the value
of our rurrency is prejudicial to our
pro-perity, and tends to keep up prices
to the detriment of trade. The evils
of a depreciated and fluctuating cur
rency are so great that now, when tne
premium on gold has fallen so much,
it would seem that the time has ar
rived when by wise-and prudent legis
lation Congress should look to a policy
which would place our currency at par
with gold at no distant oav. The rev
enue collected from the people has been
reduced more than oi) million dollars
per annum. Bv steadiness in our pres
ent course there is no reason why, in a
lew short years, the national tax jjatu
erer may not disappear from the door
of the citizen almost entirely. With
the revene stamps dispensed" by the
Postmasters in every comniuuitv, a
tax upon liquors of all sons, and to
bacco in all its forms, and ly a wise
adjustment of the tariff, which will
put a duty only upon those articles
which one could dispense with, known
as luxuries, aud on those which we use
more ol than we produce, revenue
enough may be raised, after a few
years of peace, and consequent reduc
tion oi indebtedness, to iuinii an our
obligations. A further reduction of ex-poinjOj-in
addition -to-f-rt duel ion of irr-
teresir account , may ue reneu on iu
make this. Practical revenue reform,
if it means this, has my hearty sup
port. If it implies a collection" of all
the revenu- for tbe support of the
government, for the payment of the
principal and interest of the public
debt, pensions. Arc, by directly taxing
the people, then I am against revenue
reform and confidently believe tbe
people are with me. If it means a
failure to provide the necessary means
to defrav all the expenses oi the aov-
erntnent, and thereby repudiation of
the public debt and pensions, then 1
am still more opposed to such kind of
revenue reform. It has not been de
fined by any of its advocates, to my
knowledge, bu' seems to be accepted
as someth ng which is to supply every
man's wants without any cost or effort
on his part. A true revenue reform
can not be made in a day, bui must be
the work of national legislation and
of time. As soon as the revenue can
be dispensed with all duty should be
removed from coffee, tea and other ar
ticles of universal use not produced by
ourselves. The necessities of the
country compel us to collect revenue
irom our imports. An army ot Asses
sors and Collectors is not a pleasant
sijrht to the citizens, but that, or a
tariff for revenue, is necessary. Such
a tariff, so far as it acts in encourage
ment to home products, attoros em
plovment to labor at living wages, in
contrast to the pauper labor of the Old
W orld, and also in the development oi
home resources.
OUR ARM V.
Under the act of Congress, of the
15th day of July, 1870, the army has
gradually been reduced, and on the 1st
of January, 1871, the number of com
missioned officers and men will not ex
ceed the number c ntemplated by law,
The War Department building is an
old structure, not hre-proot, and en
tirely inadequate in dimensions to our
present wants. Manv thousands of
dollars are now paid annually for rent
of private buildings to accommodate
tiie various Dureausoi t ne department.
I recommend an appropriation for
new War Department building suited
to the present and growing wants of
the nation. The report of the Secretary
of War shows a very satistactory re
duction in the expenses of the army
for the last fiscal year. For detailn you
are reierred to his accompanying re
port.
THE NAVY.
The expenses of the navy for the
whole of the last year, from December,
18U9, the date of the last report, are less
than nineteen million dollars, or about
one million less than they were the
previous year. The expenses of the
Navy Department in this fecal year,
since July 1st, show forthe five months
a decrease of over ?2,400,t)00 from those
of the corresponding months of last
year. The estimates fur the current
vear were 828,205,670: those for the
next year are $20,083,317, with 951,000
additional for temporary and perma
nent improvements. These estimates
are made closely, for the maintenance
of the naval establishment as it now
is. without much in the nature of per-
manent improvement. The appropria
tions made for the last and current
years were evidently intended by Con
gress, ana are sumcient only, to Keep
the navy on its present footing, and
the repairing and refitting of our old
ships. This policy must, of course,
gradually but surely destroy the navy
and it is, in itself, far from economical
for each year that it is pursued the
necessity lor more repairs in ships and
navy yards becomes more imperative
and more costly : and our current ex
penses are actually increased for tbe
mere repair of ships, many of whii-h
must soon be unseaworthy and useless.
1 hope during the present year and ses
sion of Congress to be able to submit
to it a plan bv which naval vessels can
be built and repairs made with great
saving upon the present cost. It can
hardly be wise statesmanship in a gov
ernment which represents a couutry
with over five thousand miles of coast
line on both oceans, exclusive of
Alaska, and containing 40,000,000 of
progressive people, with relations of
every nature with almost every foreign
country, to rest witn sucn inaaequat
means of forcing any foreign policy.
either ot protection or redress, sepa
rated by the ocean from the nations of
the Jia.stern continent, our navy is our
only means of direct protection to our
citizens abroad, or lor tne enlorcement
of our foreign policy.
THE POSTMASTER GENERAL'S REPORT.
The accompanying report of the
Postmaster General shows a most sat
isfactory working of that department.
With the adoption of the recom
mendations contained therein, partic
ularly those relating to a reform in
the franking privil-ge. and the adop
tion of correspondence cirds, a self
sustaining postal, system may be
speedily looked for, and at no distant
day a further reduction ot the rate of
postage can be attained. I recommend
the authorization by Congress to the
Postmaster General and Attorney
General to issue all commissions to of
ficials appointed through their respect
departments. At present these com
missions, where appointments are
made, are issued by the State Depart
ment. The law iu all the departments
of government, except those of the
Postoffice and of Justice, authorizes
each to issue its own commissions.
THE CIVIL SERVICE REFORM.
Always favoring practical reforms, I
respectfully call your attention to one
abuse of long standing, which I would
like to see remedied by this Congress.
It is a reform in the civil service of the
country. I would advise it to go be
yond the mere fixing of tenure-of-of-tice
of clerks and employes, whodonot
require tbe advice and consent of the
Senate to mak- the appointments com
plete. I would have it g vera, not
the tenure only, but the manner of
making all appointments. There is no
duty which so much embarrasses the
Executive and beads of departments
as that of appointments, nor is there
any such arduous aud thankless labor
imposed on Senators and Representa
tives as that of finding places for consti
tuents. The pres nt system does not
secure the best men, and often not ev
en fit men for public places. The ele
vation and pui ification of tbe civil ser
vice of the government will be hailed
with approval by the whole people of
the United States.
THE INDIAN POLICY.
Reform in the management of In
dian allairB has received the special at
tention of tie administration from its
inauguration to the present day. The
experiment was tried of making it a
mission-try agency, given to the de
nomination of Friends, aud has been
found to work most advantageously.
All the agenciesand superinleiideni-ieo
not so disposed of were given to offi
cers of the army. The act of Congress
reducing the army renders o Ulcers in
eligible for civil positions. Indian
agencies being civil offices, I deter
mined to give all the agencies to such
religious denominations as had hereto
fore" staulished missionaries among
the Indians, and perhaps to some oth
er denominations who would under
take the w- rk on the Bauie terms us
a missionary work.
The society selected are allowed to
name their own agents, subject to the
approval of the Executive, and are ex
pected to watch over them and aid
them as missionaries and Christians,
and civilize the Indian, and to train
him in the arts of peace. The govern
ment watches over the official acts of
these agents, and requires of them as
strict an accountability as if they
were appointed in any other manner.
I entertain the confident hope that the
policy now pursued will in a few years
bring all the Indians upon reserva
tions where they will live in houses,
have school houses and churches, will
be pursuing peaceful and self-sustaining
avocations, and where they may
be visited by the law-abiding white
man with the same impunity that he
now -isits the civilized white settle
ments. I call your attention to the re
port of the Commissioner of Indian af
fairs for full information on this sub
ject. THE PmLIC LANDS.
During tbe last fiscal year S09,541,3O0
acres of public land were disposed of.
Of this quantity 309,891,000 acres were
taken under the homestead law, and
215,951 581 sold for cash. The remain
der was located by the military war
rants, college or Indian scrip, or ap-
nlied in satisfaction ot grants to ran
roads, or for other public uses. The
entries under the Homestead law dur
ing the past year coverea 961, 54o acres
more man mose uuring luo prei-ouing

oiosecuted to the full extent of the
means applicable to tne purpose ana
the auautitv of land ill market will
amply supply the present demand.
The claim of those settled under the
Homestead or Pre-emption laws is not,
however, limited to lands subject to
sale at private entry. Any unappropria
ted surveyed pudiic iana mav, to a
limiied auiouut, be acquired under the
former laws, it lhe party entitled to
enter under them will comply with

curd to residence and cultivation
The actual settler's preference or light
of purchase is even broader, and ex
tends to tanas wnicn were unsurveyea
at the time of his settlement. His
riirht was formerly confined within
much narrower limns, auu ai one pe
riod of our history was conferred only
bv special statutes. They were enact
ed from time to time to legalize what
was regarded as an unauthorized in
trusion nn-n the national domain
The opinion that the public lands
should be recraraea cnieuv as a source
of revenue is no loncrer maintained.
The rapid settlement and successful
cultivation of them is now justly con
Ridered of more importance to our well
beiniz than is the fund which the sale
of them would produce. The remark
able growth and prosperity ot our states
and Territories attest the wisdom of
the legislation which invites the tiller
of the soil to secure a permanent borne
on terms within the reach of all. The
nioneer. who incur the dangers ana
n-ivations of a frontier life, and thus
aids in lnving the foundation of new
commonwealths, renders a signal ser
vice to his country and is entitled to
its sDeeial favor and protection. The
laws secure that object, and large
ly promote the general welfare. They
should, therefore, be cherished
permanent feature of our laud system
Good faith requires us to give full ef
fect to existing grants. Tbe time-hon
ored and beneficent policy cf setting
apart certain sec ions of the public
land for educational purposes in the
States should be continued. When
ample provision shall have been made
lor tnese oojects, x buuuiu, as ques
tion worthy of serious consideration
whether the residue of our national
domain should not be wholly disposed
of under the provisions ot the Home
stead and pre-emption laws. In addi
tion to the swamp and overflowed
lands granted to tbe State in which they
are situated, the lands taken under the
Agricultural College acts and tor in
ternal improvements or improvemen
purposes under the act of September,
1841. and the acts supplemental there
to, there had been conveyed up to the
close oi the last hscai year, by patent
or other equivalent evidence ot title,
to States and corporations. 2,783,625,
and 1-100 acres for railways, canals and
wagon roads. It is estimated that an
additional quantity of 174,735,523 acre.
is still due under grants for like uses.
The policy of thus aiding the States in
buildincr works of internal improve
ment was inaugurated more thau forty
years since on tne grants to Indian
and Illinois on the opening or the ca
nals to connect the waters of the Wa
bash with those of Lake Erie, an
those of the Illinois with those of L,ak
Miehieran. It was followed, with som
modification, in the grant to Iil-nois of
alternate sections of public land wiihin
certain limits of the Illinois Central
Railway. Fourteen States and sun
dry corporations have received simi
lar subsidies in connec ion with rail
ways completed or in process of con
struction. As the reserved sections are
rated at double the minium price tbe
sale of ihem at the enhanced prices h -s
thus, in many instances, idnmnified the
Treasury for the granted lands. The
construction of some of these thorough
fares has un'toub'edly given vigorous
impel us to the developemeui of our re
sources, ana tne settlement oi tne
more distant portions of the country.
It may, however, De insisted that
much of our legislation in this regard
has been characterized by indiscrimi
nate and profuse liberality. The Um
ti-d States fhould not loan their credit
in aid of anv enterprise undertaken
by States or corporations unless the
projected works are of acknowledged
material importance. I am strongly
inclined to the opinion that it is inex
pedientnd unnecessary to bestow
subsidies of either description, but
should Congress determine otherwise,
1 earne-tly recommend that the rights
of settlers and of the public be more
effectually secured, and perfected by
appropriate legislation.
THE PATENT OFFICE.
During the year ending September
20, 1870, there weie filed in the Patent
Office 19,411 applicationa for patents,
3,374 caveats, and 160 applications for
the extension of patents; 13, 022 pat
ents, including re-issues and designs,
were issued, 11,094 extended, and 1,080
allowed but not issued, by reasoDof the
non-payment oi the final fees. The re
ceipts of the office during the fiscal yer
were $136,304 29 in excess of its expend
itures. THE CENSUS.
The work of the Census Bureau has
been energetically prosecuted. Tlio
preliminary report, containing much
information of special value and inter
est, will be ready for delivery during
the present session. The remaining vol
umes will be completed with all the
dispatch consistent with perfect accu
racy in arranging ana classifying the
returns. We shall thus at no distant
day be furnished with an authetic
record of our condition and resouices.
It will, I doubt not, attest the growing
prosperity of the country, although
dur-ngtlie decade which hasjust closed
it was so severely tried by the great
war waged to maintain its integrity,
and to secure and perpetuate our free
institutions.
PENSIONS.
During the last fiscal year the sum
paid to pensioners, including the cost
of disbursement, was $27,780,811 11, and
1 758 bounty land warrants were issued.
At its close, 198,08(3 names were on the
pension rolls. The labor of the Pen
sion Office have been directed to a se
v re scrutiny of the evidence submit-t-
d in favor of lawful claims, and to
the discovery of fictitious claims here
tofore allowed. The appropriation for
the employment of special agents lor
tne in ve-tigatiou oi irauus nas oeen
judiciously used, and the results ob
tained have been of unquestionable
benefit to the service.
EDUCATION AND AGRICULTURE.
The subjects of education and agri
culture are of great interest to the suc
cess of our republican institutions,
happiness and grandeur as a nation.
In the interests of one a Bureau has
been established in the Interior De
partment, the Bureau of Kducation,
and in the interests of the other, a sep
arate Department, that of Agrioulture.
I believe great general good is to fol
low from the operations of boih these
Bureaus, if properly fostered. I can
not commend to your careful consid
eration too highly the reports ot the
Commissioners of Kducation and of
Agriculture, nor urge too strongly such
liberal legislation to secure their effi
ciency. THE POLICY OP THE ADMINISTRATION.
In conclusion, I would sum up the
policy of tbe administration to be a
thorough enforcement of every law ;
a f.ithl'ul collection of the taxes pro
vided for; economy in iho disburse
ment of the same ; a prompt payment
of every debt of the nation i a 'reduc
tion of taxes as rapidly a the require
ments of the eoui.try will admit; a in
duction of taxation and the tariff to be
mo arranged as to all -rd the greatest
relief to the grea'est number ; hou- st
and tatrdealiuus with all other people,
to the end that war, with all its blight-(
ing cunsequeuuf h, may be avoided, but I
without surrendering any right orob-J
igation due to us ; a reform in the
reatment of the Indians, and In the
whole civil service of the country ; and
finally, in securing a surf, nntram
meled ballot, at which every man en
titled to cast a vote may do so just once
at each election, without fear of mo
lestation or proscription, on account of
his political faith, nativity or color,

attention to the low terms offered to Clubs,
we would ask the public to bear In mind
that the Gazette coi tains more reading
matter than any other paper printed In

Information In each Weikly than other
papers which are published at about the
same price, la comparing prices this is a
point that should not be overlooked.

The AGRICULTURAL DEPARTMENT.
The attention of fanners is particularly
directed to the Agricultural department of
the Gazette, which Is a specialty in the
Weekly edition. Ti ls contains, to a large
extent, an Interchange of views between
practical men, which Is proving interesting
and valuable, and has, during the la-t year
been universally commended by our sub
scribers. The information thus obtained
from practical men, and disseminated
through the column of the Oazettk, 1 of
more real value than volumes that are
written on agricultural subjects by mere
theorists. The man who d-s a thin H far
