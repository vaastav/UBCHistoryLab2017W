Lnless he desires it, no person can be de
ceived by the Democratic attempt to make
It appear that the bond which the City
Ccfncil recently voted are intended to meet
current expenses. Every dollar goes to pay
thJ deficits of the Taggart administration
dufing Its last two years.
ie unequivocal Indorsement of the pro
tective policy Is explained away for the
Pr sident by hi free-trade friends by
sa; Ing that he is expressing the opinions
of Js lamented predecessor rather than his
ow i, which is scarcely complimentary to
ilH Roosevelt.
v Vsrabers of Congress are generally of
oplilon that President Roosevelt under
stands army and navy problems better and
harMles them with more abll'ty than any
2rtj;ident cf recent years. This is probably
becl.use he has studied them and does not
get his opinions or conclusions at second
haiji.
Lws dealing with foreign Anarchists will
not? meet all reiuireraents. The assassin
wh took the life of President McKinley
wa. a native, and the same L5 true of the
mu derer of Lincoln and Garfield. It can
be . 1dcd that Czolgocz was never in Europe
kJidj that whatever of anarchism he imbibed
he picked up In this country without being
a member of any association. Men who are
drawing- bills for Congress to consider
should try to deal with local Anarchists
rather than those in foreign lands.
Tha President's experience as Governor of
Herr York can be traced in some of the
reccmmendatlons In hi3 messa.. The one
la regard to publicity as a remedy for the
evils of trusts was In one of his messages
Governor, when he said: "Supervision
and publicity ara needed quite as much for
the sake of the honest corporations as for
the 'sake of tha public, The first
essential Ls knowledge of the facts pub
licity." As Governor he also bad good op
port'onltles to Investigate the convict con
tract labor question, concerning which he
znadvbs a strong recommendation the first
taad j by any President.
The. public will not be satisfied with the
terd'et of the coroner's Jury regarding the
recent disastrous railroad collision in Michigan-
Laying tho responsibility for an accident-
In which seventy or eighty persona
were killed on half a dozen trainmen, every
cne of whom. If the verdict is correct, was
unfit for hU position, does not fix tho ulti
mate responsibility. The public will want
to kow and has a right to know why such
unfit men are employed in positions of great
responsibility, and how so many of them
cm to be contributory to a terrible acci
dent. "Were they all incompetmt, all stu
pid, all overworked, or were their superiors
to Ijame for giving1 unintelligible orders?
Thj apparent expenditures cf the State
8oldrs' Home for the last fiscal year were
XVJ,ri.42. The United States paid 431.207.SS,
and $3,C"7.0J of the maintenance fund was
expended In extending the plans and for re
pairs. "Without making that deduction the
per capita cost to the State last year was
$110.50. If th3 amount expended for repairs,
etc., distinct from maintenance, is deducted,
the per capita expense was $103.50. In Il
linois, which cares for no women In Its
homes, the per capita cost was JIOC.CS; in
Nebraska, the cost was $214.33; in New
York, $230.03, and in New Jersey, $1S2.G3.
"When it is considered that It Is consider
ably more expensive to care for both men
and women In such institutions, the cost of
the Indiana Home ls considerably lower
than the favorable figures show.
DOMESTIC AFFAIRS MOST I31POR
TANT. Among many distinguishing features of
President Roosevelt's message there Is
none more conspicuous than the insistent
way in which It emphasizes the superior
importance of domestic affairs over foreign
relations. No previous message by any
President ever did this to the same extent.
It had become an established custom for
our Presidents to give what might be called
the place of honor in their messages to our
foreign relations, making it the first princi
pal topic of treatment, as if It were the
most important. President Roosevelt
Ecarcely refers to the subject at all. After
Epeaklng appropriately of the tragic death
of Mr. McKinley and disposing of the sub
ject of anarchism he passed at once to con
sider Industrial conditions and the great
social and economic problems growing out
of them the relations of capital and labor,
trusts, the welfare of wage earners, the se
cret of our commercial success, how to ex
tend and prolong It, etc. Then he treats in
succession the American immigration laws,
American tariff policy, American merchant
marine, American currency, American for
est protection and irrigation, the American
army and navy, and bo on to the end, mak
ing American affairs and Interests prom
inent abova all others. The President's
idea seemed to be that as a young, growing
and undeveloped nation our chief concern
is with domestic and not with foreign af
fairs, and that our time can be far more
profitably spent In making the moat of our
selves and our opportunities than In worry
ing about our foreign relations. Or, to put
it In another form, if we take care of our
domestic relations, developing cur material
resources to the utmost and establishing
and maintaining the highest possible stand
ard of political virtue and American citi
zenship, our foreign relations will take care
of themselves. "All we want Is peace,"
says the President. Again: "Probably no
other nation In the world Is so anxious for
peace as we are." And still again: "The
true end of every great and free people
should be self-respecting peace." "With
peace and steady adherence to high Ideals
the President foresees the building up of a
nation which will be so happy, prosperous
and powerful that It can afford to be equal
ly Indifferent to the smiles or frowns of
other powers. His placing of domestic af
fairs over foreign is tho keynote of twen
tieth century Americanism.
SEC It ETA It Y GAGE'S REPORT.
Secretary Gage Informs Congress that
the surplus the present fiscal year will be
about $100,000,000, one-half of which must
be applied to the sinking fund, leaving
$50,000,000 to be disposed of by a reduction
of revenue, lie recommends that the war
taxes Imposed in 1S0S, with the exception cf
the increase on malt liquors, be repealed,
which will dispose of $27,500,000. He esti
mates the expenditures for the fiscal year
which will end June 20, 1002, will be $172,000,
000, or nearly $3S,000,000 less than the last
fiscal year, showing that tho surplus ls
largely due to declining expenditures.
The secretary devotes considerable at
tention to the national banking system.
While the system is admirably adapted to
seasons of pro'sperity he deems it inade
quate In seasons of peril. A bank fails
or a firm goes to the wall, thereupon un
certainty prevails, banks curtail their
credits, and business Is checked and fac
tories closed. "While Secretary Gage does
not recommend a central bank, a plan
which does not lack advocates, he sug
gests a defensive union by all the banks
In a given territory to protect any one of
their number from suspension. He calls
attention to the fact that upon the basis
of the Issue of currency by national banks
secured by United States bonds, bank note
currency has nearly reached its limit, and
that some other plan must bo adopted to
supply the currency required by increas
ing population. Mr. Gage's plan for the in
crease of bank-not circulation is that
any bank, on depositing with tho govern
ment 30 per cent, of Its capital in United
States bonds and 20 per cent, in legal
tender notes, shall be entitled to issue
circulation notes to an amount equal to its
paid-in and unimpaired capital, banks is
suing such notes to pay Into the treasury
in trust an amount equal to one-fifth of
1 per cent, on their capital stock, which
shall be a guaranty fund for the notes of
any involved bank. This is different from
some of the other plans for the issue of
bank notes upon the assets of banks. Ono
of the objects of this plan is to place the
greenbacks where the treasury will not
be called upon to redeem them when pre
sented. Such redemption causes no dif
ficulty now, but it has in the past, and may
again. The secretary enters into an ar
gument to show that the notes of banks
under tho plan proposed will be as safe
for the holder as are the notes of such
Institutions under the existing law.
The secretary favors the encouragement
of a merchant marine, not in the form of
the Frye ship-subsidy bill, but by the pay
ment of graded bounties on mileage navi
gated by American vessels while engaged
in the foreign carrying trade. This is
much the same plan as that put into oper
ation by the Harrison administration but
set aside by Its successor.
A XCEUKD HIVKIt IMPIIOVE.MEXT.
The Journal's record of opposition to use
less and extravagant appropriations for
river and harbor improvements is so clear
that It feels free to approve those which
are needed. Of this class is the proposed
improvement of the Ohio river between
New Albany and Cincinnati by the con
struction of movable dams at such roints
as will Insure a boating stage of water
during the entire year. Owing to changed
conditions caused by tho removal of forests,
etc., the Ohio, like all other streams, car
ries' so much less water than formerly that
it has ceased to be the reliable highway
of traffic that It once was, and can only
be made so by artificial means. The causes
which have rroduced this condition were
referred to by the President In his recent
message, when la discussing; foresU and
arid lands he said: "The water-storing ca
pacity of the surface ha? been decreased
or destroyed, thus promoting floods in times
of rain and diminishing the flow of streams
between rains." The object of the pro
posed Improvement of tho Ohio ls to con
serve the reduced supply of water "be
tween rains" in such a way as to Insure a
boating stage at all times. Thi3 plan has
been adopted In some smaller streams and
also In the upper Ohio, and Its feasibility
has been demonstrated beyond a doubt.
Tho success of tho movable dam system
as applied in the river above Cincinnati is
argument enough for its application below
that city to a portion of the river that is
of great importance to the States of Ohio,
Indiana and Kentucky. Owing to the
broken and hilly character of southern In
diana and consequent difficulty of building
railroads that section of tho State has not
developed as rapidly as some others, and is
now deprived a portion of every year of
what was onco a reliable waterway at all
times. The restoration of the river to
something like its former reliableness as
a waterway the year round would be of
immense benefit to a large section of coun
try which is at least as deserving as any
other of national aid in the way of public
improvements. The river and harbor bill
to be introduced during the present ses
sion of Congress will not contain an item
of more real merit than this one. It should
have the cordial support of all the senators
and representatives from every State bor
dering on the Ohio river.
The President concluded his vigorous dis
cussion of anarchism as follows:
Anarchy is a crime aerainst the whole
human race; and all mankind should band
against the Anarchist. Ills crime should
be mado an offense a gainst the law of na
tions, like piracy and that form of man
stealing known as the slave trade; for It is
of far blacker infamy than either. It should
be sc declared by treatl-s amonf? all civil
ized powers. Such treaties would give to
the federal government the power of deal
ing with the crime.
Readers of the Journal may recall a com
munication from Hon. A. C. Harris, pub
lished shortly after President McKinley's
death. In which, by a very clear course of
reasoning, he reached practically the same
conclusions. He discussed tho analogies
between anarchism, piracy and the slave
trade, and concluded that they were all
alike crimes which, under international
law, could be reached by the action of all
civilized nations. "As near as may be,"
wrote Mr. Harris, "anarchy should be
treated as piracy. By common accord and
co-operative action that crimo and man
stealing have been exterminated," and he
held that anarchism should be treated the
same way. The President's search for an
effective remedy seems to have led him to
the same conclusion.

VIEWS OF ME. MACK.
He Snys the Democrats Cannot Afford
to Change Platform Every Minute.
LAKE WOOD, X. J., Dec 4. National
Democratic committeeman Norman E.
Mack, of New York, said to-day with refer
ence to the McCIellan and Fitzgerald reso
lutions that the Democratic national plat
form of 1DÖ0 would stand until a new one
was made, and nothing but harm and dis
ruption to the party could come from any
attempt to change it until it is done by the
representatives of all Democrats in the na
tional convention in 1004, for unless the
Democrats of Eastern States stand by the
last declaration of the party, dominated by
the Southt-j-n and Western States, there
would be no good reason why the South
and West should abide by the national plat
form dominated by the Eastern States in
li04 if they should succeed in controlling
and dominating the convention. "The fact
of the matter is," he said, "that the-Democratic
party cannot afford to change its
national platform every minute. If it does
not stand by the present one for four years
what assurance will the people have that it
will stand by the next one for four years?
I don't mean by this that the liH)i campaign
would not be conducted on issues entirely
different from those of 1100."

RULING FOR BANKERS
oriMox nv tiic commissioxer of
INTERNAL REVENUE.
Capital, Surplus, Undivided Profits
and Ilorrowed Money 3Iust Re
Returned for Taxation.
INSTRUCTIONS FROM MR. GAGE
NO CUSTOMS DUTIES OX IMPORTS
FROM THE PHILIPPINES.
Supreme Court Decision Discussed at
the "White House Cubans
Want Reciprocity.
"WASHINGTON. Dec 4. The commis
sioner of internal revenue has rendered a
decision in which he holds that bankers
must return fo,r taxation capital, surplus,
undivided profits and borrowed money used
in the business of banking. The commis
sioner holds that capital is taxable whether
invested, as in the case of the United
States bonds or the bank building, or cir
culating a3 Jn the case of monsy, including
money borrowed; also surplus, including
undivided profits.
"In providing that surplus shall be In
cluded as capital," the decision says, "it
is obviously the purpose of the law to have
the tax imposed apply to money used or
employed by banks, as capital, in carrying
on their busine33. Money borrowed by
banks, and used as capital, is held to be
taxable and it is clearly no less liable to
tax because of the fact that it is bor
rowed by a bank from its own undivided
profits. The fact that surplus so used con
sists wholly or in part of undivided profits,
or that such undivided proflts have, or
have not been fo.mally set apart for such
use seems wholly Immaterial, so far as the
purpose of the act is concerned, it is the
use, and not the authority to use, that
brings such profits within the taxing pro
Visions of the act.
"Banks should, therefore, return for
taxation the capital, the surplus fund, their
undivided profits or other profit and loss
account, except so much thereof as may be
actually necessary and has been set apart
to meet ascertained liabilities and loss, or
to pay dividends actually declared by the
directors of the bank, to pay taxes, or to
pay lixed annual charges, such as salaries
and other necessary annual expenses."
Redemption of Stnmps.
WASHINGTON, Dec. 4. Mr. Tracewell,
the controller of the treasury, has decided
that the act of May 12, 1900, prohibits the
allowance of any claim for the redemption
of documentary internal revenue stamps,
unless presented within two years after
the purchase of the stamps from the gov
ernment. The question raised was whether
the two years should run from the time the
stamps were purchased by the person ap
plying for their redemeption, or from the
time they were orglnally purchased from
the government.
COLLECTIONS DISCONTINUED.
Xo More Duties 011 Import from the
Philippines.
WASHINGTON, Dec. 4. The .secretary of
the treasury to-day issued the following
circular of instructions to collectors of
customs regarding the refund of duties col
lected on imports from the Philippine
islands:
"Referring to the recent decision of the
Supreme Court of the United States rela
tive to importations from the Philippine
islands I have to confirm the department's
telegram of the 3d inst., as follows: 'Dis
continue requirement entry and collection
of duty on merchandise shown by manifest
of vessel to be shipped from Philippines.
Allow free delivery of goods in bond. De
tain cigars and cigarettes until internal
revenue stamps are atllxed under Circulars
81 and 85, current year. Refunds will be
made- by certified statement where protests
are duly filed.' With regard to the matter
of refunds I have to state that in addition
to the forwarding of certified statements as
above directed you will forward certified
statements in cases where no protests have
been filed when so requested by the parties
in interest, with a view to submitting esti
mates for appropriation to Congress should
it be found that no existing appropriation
is available."
Secretary Root ls taking counsel with
some of the Republican party leaders in the
preparation of a programme to meet the de
cisions of the Supreme Court in the Insular
cases. It is said that the present purpose
is to legislate Immediately to define with
precision the status of the Philippines from
a revenue point of view. While neither of
the cases decided on Monday the Pepke
"fourteen diamond rings" case nor the
Dooley case alttrmed nor denied the rigqt
of "the Philippine authorities to collect du
ties on goods entering Manila from the
United States, the officials of the War De
partment in the absence of legislation in
tend to continue the collection of the duties
at the present rate at Manila.
The financial officers at the department
who have looked li.to the trade figures fur
the past three years find that the sum of
ll.OO.W-O represents about the total of the
duties collected from Spaniards on goods
arriving at Manila, which might have to be
refunded in the event that it should ulti
mately be held that the collection of duties
on American goods there was illegal. The
Spaniards would secure a like liquidation
under the terms of the peace treaty guaran
teeing them equal rights with American
merchants in the Philippines.
President Roosevelt to-day entertained a
distinguished company at luncheon. Among
the guests were Mayor-elect Low, of New
York, Senators Depew, Piatt and Frye,
Secretaries Root and Hay, Attorney Gen
eral Knox, Ambassador Choate, Represent
ative Littauer, of New York, and Mr. Cor
telyou. The decision of the Supreme Court in the
Philippines ease was discv.ssed and the con
clusion reached to have a bill introduced at
once in Congress to correct the situation at
San Francisco by levying a duty on goods
coming from the Philippines, and, if neces
sary, to further legalize the present duty
on goods entering the Philippines.
Recess Appointments.
WASHINGTON, Dec. 4. Tho President
to-day sent a number of recess appoint
ments to the Senate and tho new appoint
ment of George W. Lleberth, of Kentucky,
to bo collector of Internal revenue for the
Sixth district of Kentucky. Among the te
cess appointments sent In was that of At
torney General Knox.
The President and Postmaster General
Smith had a conference to-day, at which
it was decided to reappoint Cornelius Van
Cott postmaster at New York, Dwight II.
Bruce postmaster at Syracuse and W. 11.
Smythe postmaster at Oswego.
The names of W. Dudley Foulke, of
Richmond, and R. E. Mansfield, of In
dianapolis, were the only Indianlans among
the appointments sent to the Senate to
day. The other Indiana recess appointees
will go to the Senate for confirmation in a
couple of days.
Distribution of Indemnity.
WASHINGTON, Dec. 4. Secretary Hay
has ordered the final distribution of the in
demnity fund, amounting to JyO.O1"), paid by
Turkey to the United States on account of
the destruction of mission property at
Harput and elsewhere, the killing of Bi
cyclist Lenz, of Pittsburg, and other mat
ters. Of the claims that were filed at the
State Department forty-one were rejected,
and twenty-one were allowed, some of the
latter, however, being slightly reduced in
order to bring the total w-ithin the amount
of the indemnity.
TnrtiT and Trusts.
WASHINGTON, Dec. 4. Representative
Pearre has proposed a plan of dealing with
the tariff and trusts somewhat similar to
tho plan proposed last year by Representa
tive Rabcock. which caused much discus
sion. Mr. Pearre's bill authorizes and di
rects the suspension of tariff duties on
imports when their salo or manufacture
are monopolized. Provision also Is made
for a commission to report to the Presi
dent on the eubJecL
Süss Stone's "Whereabouts.
WASHINGTON, Dec. 4.-The State De
partment to-day received a cablegram
from Spencer Eddy, United States charge
d'affaires at Constantinople, reporting thatt
Miss Stone and her companion, Madame
Tsilka, are held prisoners at a place called
Cultepe, on the south side of the mountain.
The lluy-Pauncefote Treaty.
WASHINGTON, Dec. 4. In the executive
session of the Senate to-day the new Hay
Pauncefote treaty was received and re
ferred to the committee on foreign rela

the goods going into the islands. The sec
cond section of the bill provides for levy
ing the same duty and tariff on goods com

pine islands that are now collected from
foreign countries. Section three provides
that until otherwise ordered, statutory laws
of the United States shall not be In force
in the Philippine islands, except as ordered
by the Philippine commission. Section four
provides that all duties collected in the
Philippine islands shall be paid into the
Philippine treasury.

Mr. Lodge also Introduced a bill pro
viding for the removal of tho ten-years
limitation on the Chinese exclusion act,
thus leaving the provisions of the Geary
act In force. That act, which was approved
May 5, 1892. excluded the Chinese indefinite
ly, but the Scott act of Nov. 5, 1393, limited
tho exclusion to ten years. In case there
is no legislation in the meantime, the ten
years limit would expire next May. Senator
Lodge's bill is brief and is as follows: "That
so much of Section 1, of the act of Con
gress approved Nov. 3, 1S93, 'to prevent the
coming of Chinese persons into the United

DR. PAACHE'S WARNING
HE SAYS GERMANS 31 AY WELL FEAR
THE "AMERICAN PERIL."
Speech by a Member of the Reichstag
Who Studied Industrial Con
ditions In This Country.
BERLIN, Dec 4. During the course of
the tariff debate in tho Reichstag to-day
Dr. Paache, of Halle University, sounded
the strongest warning concerning the
"American peril" which has yet been ut
tered. Dr. Paacho visited the United States
In to study the social and industrial
conditions there. Since his return he has
been lecturing on the changed balance of
the world's trade wrought by the dominat
ing growth of the United States. Duller
his address the speaker laid before the
house nurses of figures which set forth
the expansion of American manufactures
and of American foreign commerce of re
cent years and the enormous accumulation
of wealth of the United States. He accom
panied his statistics with a philosophical
analysis supporting the idea that Ger
many's most dangerous and most Immedi
ate trade enemy was the United States.
Dr. Paache said: "Peculiarly grave dan
gers threaten us from America; against
these we must put ourselves in a state cf
defense." Dr. Taache was particularly im
pressed by the rapid growth of the cotton
goods trade in the United States, which he,
said now dominated the market of the
world.
Regarding the paragraph in President
Roosevelt's message concerning reciprocity.
Dr. Paache said: "America makes a feint
of adopting a policy of more liberal com
mercial treaties, but 6he ls determined to
abandon nothing of her protective pystem.
What would it profit us if we got a rllKht
reduction of duties which are now abso
lutely prohibitive? In fpite of this our
'treaties' say we do not dare to rai.-o our
duties. Th Yankee has not a. trace of
such sentimental po'.itlcs." The oration
was sustained witn a mountainous array
of documents, such as are peculiarly grate
ful to the German mind. It was evident
Dr. Paache's fpeech Impressed the mem
bers of the Reichstag.
Herr Goethein. secretary of the Chamber
of Commerce of Breslau and a free-trader,
who was recently elected to the Reichstag
from a .strong agricultural district, warned
the Reichstag against adopting defensive
legislation directed at tho United Statt-,
as Dr. Paache demanded. He referred to
thd importance of the trade relations be
tween Germany and the United State, add
ing what he said Count Von Posad w?ki.
secretary of the interior, had lorgot to
say yesterday when he took up the cudgels
in defense of the bill, that "our cxp..rt
last year to the United States vv re larger
than those of any preceding year, .dany
people In Germany demand a tari.T war on
the United State, espec'.-iiiy the iron m n,
who complain cf the United States's hinh
duties. Whllo we should not try to avuM
a tariff war un.lor all circumstances, still
let us not play with the ilea that such
avoidance would be unpatriotic."
