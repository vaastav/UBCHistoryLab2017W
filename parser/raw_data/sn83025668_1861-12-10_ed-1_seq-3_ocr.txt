he iutrndi to hi rp his YA'atir-Cirs open during

spifly'rwovery in many dincases which depend
ou a reluiol state of the nervous System and Mus- I
cul.ir Fibrts; almost all Female cumpUiiits comt
under this head, and cures are effected ia a short
er time is cold than in warm westhcr. Ladies
fullering from diseast peculiar lo their sex are in
vited to comt and bt curtd without the ue of
(nstruntnts, Suppiriers, Caustic or Drug Medi
cine of any kind.
Mothers, look to your wtukly children, who
are complaining of Pain iu their sides and back,
and see if they huvegot a curv ature of tht Spine;
and if so, know that they can be cured and made
'might at the Manchester Water-Cure.
Rhkimathm and Nkiralioa immediately dis
appear by the application of tht Wis Fllctbo
Ciikmical Bath, then why bt confined to the

All kinds of Chronic disease are treated as suc

can avail themselves of this chance and cure them
